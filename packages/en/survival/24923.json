It is my intention to give under\r\nthe head of each species only such facts as I have been able to collect or\r\nobserve, showing the amount and nature of the changes which animals and\r\nplants have undergone whilst under man's dominion, or which bear on the\r\ngeneral principles of variation. In one case alone, namely in that of the\r\ndomestic pigeon, I will describe fully all the chief races, their history,\r\nthe amount and nature of their differences, and the probable steps by which\r\nthey have been formed. I have selected this case, because, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, the materials are better than in any other; and one case\r\nfully described will in fact illustrate all others. But I shall also\r\ndescribe domesticated rabbits, fowls, and ducks, with considerable\r\nfullness.\r\n\r\nThe subjects discussed in this volume are so connected that it is not a\r\nlittle difficult to decide how they can be best arranged. I have determined\r\nin the first part to give, under the heads of the various animals and\r\nplants, a large body of facts, some of which may at first appear but little\r\nrelated to our subject, and to devote the latter part to general\r\ndiscussions. Whenever I have found it necessary to give numerous details,\r\nin support of any proposition or conclusion, small type has been used. The\r\nreader {2} will, I think, find this plan a convenience, for, if he does not\r\ndoubt the conclusion or care about the details, he can easily pass them\r\nover; yet I may be permitted to say that some of the discussions thus\r\nprinted deserve attention, at least from the professed naturalist.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to those who have read nothing about Natural Selection, if\r\nI here give a brief sketch of the whole subject and of its bearing on the\r\norigin of species.[1] This is the more desirable, as it is impossible in\r\nthe present work to avoid many allusions to questions which will be fully\r\ndiscussed in future volumes.\r\n\r\nFrom a remote period, in all parts of the world, man has subjected many\r\nanimals and plants to domestication or culture. Man has no power of\r\naltering the absolute conditions of life; he cannot change the climate of\r\nany country; he adds no new element to the soil; but he can remove an\r\nanimal or plant from one climate or soil to another, and give it food on\r\nwhich it did not subsist in its natural state. It is an error to speak of\r\nman \"tampering with nature\" and causing variability. If organic beings had\r\nnot possessed an inherent tendency to vary, man could have done nothing.[2]\r\nHe unintentionally exposes his animals and plants to various conditions of\r\nlife, and variability supervenes, which he cannot even prevent or check.\r\nConsider the simple case of a plant which has been cultivated during a long\r\ntime in its native country, and which consequently has not been subjected\r\nto any change of climate. It has been protected to a certain extent from\r\nthe competing roots of plants of other kinds; it has generally been grown\r\nin manured soil, but probably not richer than that of many an alluvial\r\nflat; and lastly, it has been exposed to changes in its conditions, being\r\ngrown sometimes in one district and sometimes in another, in different\r\nsoils. Under such circumstances, {3} scarcely a plant can be named, though\r\ncultivated in the rudest manner, which has not given birth to several\r\nvarieties. It can hardly be maintained that during the many changes which\r\nthis earth has undergone, and during the natural migrations of plants from\r\none land or island to another, tenanted by different species, that such\r\nplants will not often have been subjected to changes in their conditions\r\nanalogous to those which almost inevitably cause cultivated plants to vary.\r\nNo doubt man selects varying individuals, sows their seeds, and again\r\nselects their varying offspring. But the initial variation on which man\r\nworks, and without which he can do nothing, is caused by slight changes in\r\nthe conditions of life, which must often have occurred under nature. Man,\r\ntherefore, may be said to have been trying an experiment on a gigantic\r\nscale; and it is an experiment which nature during the long lapse of time\r\nhas incessantly tried. Hence it follows that the principles of\r\ndomestication are important for us. The main result is that organic beings\r\nthus treated have varied largely, and the variations have been inherited.\r\nThis has apparently been one chief cause of the belief long held by some\r\nfew naturalists that species in a state of nature undergo change.\r\n\r\nI shall in this volume treat, as fully as my materials permit, the whole\r\nsubject of variation under domestication. We may thus hope to obtain some\r\nlight, little though it be, on the causes of variability,--on the laws\r\nwhich govern it, such as the direct action of climate and food, the effects\r\nof use and disuse, and of correlation of growth,--and on the amount of\r\nchange to which domesticated organisms are liable. We shall learn something\r\non the laws of inheritance, on the effects of crossing different breeds,\r\nand on that sterility which often supervenes when organic beings are\r\nremoved from their natural conditions of life, and likewise when they are\r\ntoo closely interbred. During this investigation we shall see that the\r\nprinciple of Selection is all important. Although man does not cause\r\nvariability and cannot even prevent it, he can select, preserve, and\r\naccumulate the variations given to him by the hand of nature in any way\r\nwhich he chooses; and thus he can certainly produce a great result.\r\nSelection may be followed either methodically and intentionally, or\r\nunconsciously and unintentionally. Man {4} may select and preserve each\r\nsuccessive variation, with the distinct intention of improving and altering\r\na breed, in accordance with a preconceived idea; and by thus adding up\r\nvariations, often so slight as to be imperceptible by an uneducated eye, he\r\nhas effected wonderful changes and improvements. It can, also, be clearly\r\nshown that man, without any intention or thought of improving the breed, by\r\npreserving in each successive generation the individuals which he prizes\r\nmost, and by destroying the worthless individuals, slowly, though surely,\r\ninduces great changes. As the will of man thus comes into play, we can\r\nunderstand how it is that domesticated breeds show adaptation to his wants\r\nand pleasures. We can further understand how it is that domestic races of\r\nanimals and cultivated races of plants often exhibit an abnormal character,\r\nas compared with natural species; for they have been modified not for their\r\nown benefit, but for that of man.\r\n\r\nIn a second work I shall discuss the variability of organic beings in a\r\nstate of nature; namely, the individual differences presented by animals\r\nand plants, and those slightly greater and generally inherited differences\r\nwhich are ranked by naturalists as varieties or geographical races. We\r\nshall see how difficult, or rather how impossible it often is, to\r\ndistinguish between races and sub-species, as the less well-marked forms\r\nhave sometimes been denominated; and again between sub-species and true\r\nspecies. I shall further attempt to show that it is the common and widely\r\nranging, or, as they may be called, the dominant species, which most\r\nfrequently vary; and that it is the large and flourishing genera which\r\ninclude the greatest number of varying species. Varieties, as we shall see,\r\nmay justly be called incipient species.\r\n\r\nBut it may be urged, granting that organic beings in a state of nature\r\npresent some varieties,--that their organization is in some slight degree\r\nplastic; granting that many animals and plants have varied greatly under\r\ndomestication, and that man by his power of selection has gone on\r\naccumulating such variations until he has made strongly marked and firmly\r\ninherited races; granting all this, how, it may be asked, have species\r\narisen in a state of nature? The differences between natural varieties are\r\nslight; whereas the differences are {5} considerable between the species of\r\nthe same genus, and great between the species of distinct genera. How do\r\nthese lesser differences become augmented into the greater difference? How\r\ndo varieties, or as I have called them incipient species, become converted\r\ninto true and well-defined species? How has each new species been adapted\r\nto the surrounding physical conditions, and to the other forms of life on\r\nwhich it in any way depends? We see on every side of us innumerable\r\nadaptations and contrivances, which have justly excited in the mind of\r\nevery observer the highest admiration. There is, for instance, a fly\r\n(Cecidomyia)[3] which deposits its eggs within the stamens of a\r\nScrophularia, and secretes a poison which produces a gall, on which the\r\nlarva feeds; but there is another insect (Misocampus) which deposits its\r\neggs within the body of the larva within the gall, and is thus nourished by\r\nits living prey; so that here a hymenopterous insect depends on a dipterous\r\ninsect, and this depends on its power of producing a monstrous growth in a\r\nparticular organ of a particular plant. So it is, in a more or less plainly\r\nmarked manner, in thousands and tens of thousands of cases, with the lowest\r\nas well as with the highest productions of nature.\r\n\r\nThis problem of the conversion of varieties into species,--that is, the\r\naugmentation of the slight differences characteristic of varieties into the\r\ngreater differences characteristic of species and genera, including the\r\nadmirable adaptations of each being to its complex organic and inorganic\r\nconditions of life,--will form the main subject of my second work. We shall\r\ntherein see that all organic beings, without exception, tend to increase at\r\nso high a ratio, that no district, no station, not even the whole surface\r\nof the land or the whole ocean, would hold the progeny of a single pair\r\nafter a certain number of generations. The inevitable result is an\r\never-recurrent Struggle for Existence. It has truly been said that all\r\nnature is at war; the strongest ultimately prevail, the weakest fail; and\r\nwe well know that myriads of forms have disappeared from the face of the\r\nearth. If then organic beings in a state of nature vary even in a slight\r\ndegree, owing to changes in the surrounding {6} conditions, of which we\r\nhave abundant geological evidence, or from any other cause; if, in the long\r\ncourse of ages, inheritable variations ever arise in any way advantageous\r\nto any being under its excessively complex and changing relations of life;\r\nand it would be a strange fact if beneficial variations did never arise,\r\nseeing how many have arisen which man has taken advantage of for his own\r\nprofit or pleasure; if then these contingencies ever occur, and I do not\r\nsee how the probability of their occurrence can be doubted, then the severe\r\nand often-recurrent struggle for existence will determine that those\r\nvariations, however slight, which are favourable shall be preserved or\r\nselected, and those which are unfavourable shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess\r\nany advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called\r\nNatural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea\r\nby the Survival of the Fittest. The term \"natural selection\" is in some\r\nrespects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be\r\ndisregarded after a little familiarity. No one objects to chemists speaking\r\nof \"elective affinity;\" and certainly an acid has no more choice in\r\ncombining with a base, than the conditions of life have in determining\r\nwhether or not a new form be selected or preserved. The term is so far a\r\ngood one as it brings into connection the production of domestic races by\r\nman's power of selection, and the natural preservation of varieties and\r\nspecies in a state of nature. For brevity sake I sometimes speak of natural\r\nselection as an intelligent power;--in the same way as astronomers speak of\r\nthe attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets, or as\r\nagriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of\r\nselection. In the one case, as in the other, selection does nothing without\r\nvariability, and this depends in some manner on the action of the\r\nsurrounding circumstances on the organism. I have, also, often personified\r\nthe word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but\r\nI mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural\r\nlaws,--and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events. {7}\r\n\r\nIn the chapter devoted to natural selection I shall show from experiment\r\nand from a multitude of facts, that the greatest amount of life can be\r\nsupported on each spot by great diversification or divergence in the\r\nstructure and constitution of its inhabitants. We shall, also, see that the\r\ncontinued production of new forms through natural selection, which implies\r\nthat each new variety has some advantage over others, almost inevitably\r\nleads to the extermination of the older and less improved forms. These\r\nlatter are almost necessarily intermediate in structure as well as in\r\ndescent between the last-produced forms and their original parent-species.\r\nNow, if we suppose a species to produce two or more varieties, and these in\r\nthe course of time to produce other varieties, the principle of good being\r\nderived from diversification of structure will generally lead to the\r\npreservation of the most divergent varieties; thus the lesser differences\r\ncharacteristic of varieties come to be augmented into the greater\r\ndifferences characteristic of species, and, by the extermination of the\r\nolder intermediate forms, new species come to be distinctly defined\r\nobjects. Thus, also, we shall see how it is that organic beings can be\r\nclassed by what is called a natural method in distinct groups--species\r\nunder genera, and genera under families.\r\n\r\nAs all the inhabitants of each country may be said, owing to their high\r\nrate of reproduction, to be striving to increase in numbers; as each form\r\nis related to many other forms in the struggle for life,--for destroy any\r\none and its place will be seized by others; as every part of the\r\norganization occasionally varies in some slight degree, and as natural\r\nselection acts exclusively by the preservation of variations which are\r\nadvantageous under the excessively complex conditions to which each being\r\nis exposed, no limit exists to the number, singularity, and perfection of\r\nthe contrivances and co-adaptations which may thus be produced. An animal\r\nor a plant may thus slowly become related in its structure and habits in\r\nthe most intricate manner to many other animals and plants, and to the\r\nphysical conditions of its home. Variations in the organization will in\r\nsome cases be aided by habit, or by the use and disuse of parts, and they\r\nwill be governed by the direct action {8} of the surrounding physical\r\nconditions and by correlation of growth.\r\n\r\nOn the principles here briefly sketched out, there is no innate or\r\nnecessary tendency in each being to its own advancement in the scale of\r\norganization. We are almost compelled to look at the specialization or\r\ndifferentiation of parts or organs for different functions as the best or\r\neven sole standard of advancement; for by such division of labour each\r\nfunction of body and mind is better performed. And, as natural selection\r\nacts exclusively through the preservation of profitable modifications of\r\nstructure, and as the conditions of life in each area generally become more\r\nand more complex, from the increasing number of different forms which\r\ninhabit it and from most of these forms acquiring a more and more perfect\r\nstructure, we may confidently believe, that, on the whole, organization\r\nadvances. Nevertheless a very simple form fitted for very simple conditions\r\nof life might remain for indefinite ages unaltered or unimproved; for what\r\nwould it profit an infusorial animalcule, for instance, or an intestinal\r\nworm, to become highly organized? Members of a high group might even\r\nbecome, and this apparently has occurred, fitted for simpler conditions of\r\nlife; and in this case natural selection would tend to simplify or degrade\r\nthe organization, for complicated mechanism for simple actions would be\r\nuseless or even disadvantageous.\r\n\r\nIn a second work, after treating of the Variation of organisms in a state\r\nof nature, of the Struggle for Existence and the principle of Natural\r\nSelection, I shall discuss the difficulties which are opposed to the\r\ntheory. These difficulties may be classed under the following heads:--the\r\napparent impossibility in some cases of a very simple organ graduating by\r\nsmall steps into a highly perfect organ; the marvellous facts of Instinct;\r\nthe whole question of Hybridity; and, lastly, the absence, at the present\r\ntime and in our geological formations, of innumerable links connecting all\r\nallied species. Although some of these difficulties are of great weight, we\r\nshall see that many of them are explicable on the theory of natural\r\nselection, and are otherwise inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIn scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis, and\r\nif it explains various large and independent classes of facts it rises to\r\nthe rank of a well-grounded theory. The {9} undulations of the ether and\r\neven its existence are hypothetical, yet every one now admits the\r\nundulatory theory of light. The principle of natural selection may be\r\nlooked at as a mere hypothesis, but rendered in some degree probable by\r\nwhat we positively know of the variability of organic beings in a state of\r\nnature,--by what we positively know of the struggle for existence, and the\r\nconsequent almost inevitable preservation of favourable variations,--and\r\nfrom the analogical formation of domestic races. Now this hypothesis may be\r\ntested,--and this seems to me the only fair and legitimate manner of\r\nconsidering the whole question,--by trying whether it explains several\r\nlarge and independent classes of facts; such as the geological succession\r\nof organic beings, their distribution in past and present times, and their\r\nmutual affinities and homologies. If the principle of natural selection\r\ndoes explain these and other large bodies of facts, it ought to be\r\nreceived. On the ordinary view of each species having been independently\r\ncreated, we gain no scientific explanation of any one of these facts. We\r\ncan only say that it has so pleased the Creator to command that the past\r\nand present inhabitants of the world should appear in a certain order and\r\nin certain areas; that He has impressed on them the most extraordinary\r\nresemblances, and has classed them in groups subordinate to groups. But by\r\nsuch statements we gain no new knowledge; we do not connect together facts\r\nand laws; we explain nothing.\r\n\r\nIn a third work I shall try the principle of natural selection by seeing\r\nhow far it will give a fair explanation of the several classes of facts\r\njust alluded to. It was the consideration of these facts which first led me\r\nto take up the present subject. When I visited, during the voyage of H.M.S.\r\n_Beagle_, the Galapagos Archipelago, situated in the Pacific Ocean about\r\n500 miles from the shore of South America, I found myself surrounded by\r\npeculiar species of birds, reptiles, and plants, existing nowhere else in\r\nthe world. Yet they nearly all bore an American stamp. In the song of the\r\nmocking-thrush, in the harsh cry of the carrion-hawk, in the great\r\ncandlestick-like opuntias, I clearly perceived the neighbourhood of\r\nAmerica, though the islands were separated by so many miles of ocean from\r\nthe mainland, and differed much from it in their geological {10}\r\nconstitution and climate. Still more surprising was the fact that most of\r\nthe inhabitants of each separate island in this small archipelago were\r\nspecifically different, though most closely related to each other. The\r\narchipelago, with its innumerable craters and bare streams of lava,\r\nappeared to be of recent origin; and thus I fancied myself brought near to\r\nthe very act of creation. I often asked myself how these many peculiar\r\nanimals and plants had been produced: the simplest answer seemed to be that\r\nthe inhabitants of the several islands had descended from each other,\r\nundergoing modification in the course of their descent; and that all the\r\ninhabitants of the archipelago had descended from those of the nearest\r\nland, namely America, whence colonists would naturally have been derived.\r\nBut it long remained to me an inexplicable problem how the necessary degree\r\nof modification could have been effected, and it would have thus remained\r\nfor ever, had I not studied domestic productions, and thus acquired a just\r\nidea of the power of Selection. As soon as I had fully realized this idea,\r\nI saw, on reading Malthus on Population, that Natural Selection was the\r\ninevitable result of the rapid increase of all organic beings; for I was\r\nprepared to appreciate the struggle for existence by having long studied\r\nthe habits of animals.\r\n\r\nBefore visiting the Galapagos I had collected many animals whilst\r\ntravelling from north to south on both sides of America, and everywhere,\r\nunder conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive,\r\nAmerican forms were met with--species replacing species of the same\r\npeculiar genera. Thus it was when the Cordilleras were ascended, or the\r\nthick tropical forests penetrated, or the fresh waters of America searched.\r\nSubsequently I visited other countries, which in all the conditions of life\r\nwere incomparably more like to parts of South America, than the different\r\nparts of that continent were to each other; yet in these countries, as in\r\nAustralia or Southern Africa, the traveller cannot fail to be struck with\r\nthe entire difference of their productions. Again the reflection was forced\r\non me that community of descent from the early inhabitants or colonists of\r\nSouth America would alone explain the wide prevalence of American types of\r\nstructure throughout that immense area.\r\n\r\nTo exhume with one's own hands the bones of extinct and {11} gigantic\r\nquadrupeds brings the whole question of the succession of species vividly\r\nbefore one's mind; and I had found in South America great pieces of\r\ntesselated armour exactly like, but on a magnificent scale, that covering\r\nthe pigmy armadillo; I had found great teeth like those of the living\r\nsloth, and bones like those of the cavy. An analogous succession of allied\r\nforms had been previously observed in Australia. Here then we see the\r\nprevalence, as if by descent, in time as in space, of the same types in the\r\nsame areas; and in neither case does the similarity of the conditions by\r\nany means seem sufficient to account for the similarity of the forms of\r\nlife. It is notorious that the fossil remains of closely consecutive\r\nformations are closely allied in structure, and we can at once understand\r\nthe fact if they are likewise closely allied by descent. The succession of\r\nthe many distinct species of the same genus throughout the long series of\r\ngeological formations seems to have been unbroken or continuous. New\r\nspecies come in gradually one by one. Ancient and extinct forms of life\r\noften show combined or intermediate characters, like the words of a dead\r\nlanguage with respect to its several offshoots or living tongues. All these\r\nand other such facts seemed to me to point to descent with modification as\r\nthe method of production of new groups of species.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable past and present inhabitants of the world are connected\r\ntogether by the most singular and complex affinities, and can be classed in\r\ngroups under groups, in the same manner as varieties can be classed under\r\nspecies and sub-varieties under varieties, but with much higher grades of\r\ndifference. It will be seen in my third work that these complex affinities\r\nand the rules for classification receive a rational explanation on the\r\nprinciple of descent, together with modifications acquired through natural\r\nselection, entailing divergence of character and the extinction of\r\nintermediate forms. How inexplicable is the similar pattern of the hand of\r\na man, the foot of a dog, the wing of a bat, the flipper of a seal, on the\r\ndoctrine of independent acts of creation! how simply explained on the\r\nprinciple of the natural selection of successive slight variations in the\r\ndiverging descendants from {12} a single progenitor! So it is, if we look\r\nto the structure of an individual animal or plant, when we see the fore and\r\nhind limbs, the skull and vertebræ, the jaws and legs of a crab, the\r\npetals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, built on the same type or\r\npattern. During the many changes to which in the course of time all organic\r\nbeings have been subjected, certain organs or parts have occasionally\r\nbecome at first of little use and ultimately superfluous; and the retention\r\nof such parts in a rudimentary and utterly useless condition can, on the\r\ndescent-theory, be simply understood. On the principle of modifications\r\nbeing inherited at the same age in the child, at which each successive\r\nvariation first appeared in the parent, we shall see why rudimentary parts\r\nand organs are generally well developed in the individual at a very early\r\nage. On the same principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, and on the\r\nprinciple of variations not generally supervening at a very early period of\r\nembryonic growth (and both these principles can be shown to be probable\r\nfrom direct evidence), that most wonderful fact in the whole round of\r\nnatural history, namely, the similarity of members of the same great class\r\nin their embryonic condition,--the embryo, for instance, of a mammal, bird,\r\nreptile, and fish being barely distinguishable,--becomes simply\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nIt is the consideration and explanation of such facts as these which has\r\nconvinced me that the theory of descent with modification by means of\r\nnatural selection is in the main true. These facts have as yet received no\r\nexplanation on the theory of independent Creations; they cannot be grouped\r\ntogether under one point of view, but each has to be considered as an\r\nultimate fact. As the first origin of life on this earth, as well as the\r\ncontinued life of each individual, is at present quite beyond the scope of\r\nscience, I do not wish to lay much stress on the greater simplicity of the\r\nview of a few forms, or of only one form, having been originally created,\r\ninstead of innumerable miraculous creations having been necessary at\r\ninnumerable periods; though this more simple view accords well with\r\nMaupertuis's philosophical axiom \"of least action.\"\r\n\r\nIn considering how far the theory of natural selection may be {13}\r\nextended,--that is, in determining from how many progenitors the\r\ninhabitants of the world have descended,--we may conclude that at least all\r\nthe members of the same class have descended from a single ancestor. A\r\nnumber of organic beings are included in the same class, because they\r\npresent, independently of their habits of life, the same fundamental type\r\nof structure, and because they graduate into each other. Moreover, members\r\nof the same class can in most cases be shown to be closely alike at an\r\nearly embryonic age. These facts can be explained on the belief of their\r\ndescent from a common form; therefore it may be safely admitted that all\r\nthe members of the same class have descended from one progenitor. But as\r\nthe members of quite distinct classes have something in common in structure\r\nand much in common in constitution, analogy and the simplicity of the view\r\nwould lead us one step further, and to infer as probable that all living\r\ncreatures have descended from a single prototype.\r\n\r\nI hope that the reader will pause before coming to any final and hostile\r\nconclusion on the theory of natural selection. It is the facts and views to\r\nbe hereafter given which have convinced me of the truth of the theory. The\r\nreader may consult my 'Origin of Species,' for a general sketch of the\r\nwhole subject; but in that work he has to take many statements on trust. In\r\nconsidering the theory of natural selection, he will assuredly meet with\r\nweighty difficulties, but these difficulties relate chiefly to\r\nsubjects--such as the degree of perfection of the geological record, the\r\nmeans of distribution, the possibility of transitions in organs, &c.--on\r\nwhich we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. If\r\nwe are much more ignorant than is generally supposed, most of these\r\ndifficulties wholly disappear. Let the reader reflect on the difficulty of\r\nlooking at whole classes of facts from a new point of view. Let him observe\r\nhow slowly, but surely, the noble views of Lyell on the gradual changes now\r\nin progress on the earth's surface have been accepted as sufficient to\r\naccount for all that we see in its past history. The present action of\r\nnatural selection may seem more or less probable; but I believe in the\r\ntruth of the theory, {14} because it collects under one point of view, and\r\ngives a rational explanation of, many apparently independent classes of\r\nfacts.[4]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{15}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC DOGS AND CATS.\r\n\r\n    ANCIENT VARIETIES OF THE DOG--RESEMBLANCE OF DOMESTIC DOGS IN VARIOUS\r\n    COUNTRIES TO NATIVE CANINE SPECIES--ANIMALS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH MAN AT\r\n    FIRST FEARLESS--DOGS RESEMBLING WOLVES AND JACKALS--HABIT OF BARKING\r\n    ACQUIRED AND LOST--FERAL DOGS--TAN-COLOURED EYE-SPOTS PERIOD OF\r\n    GESTATION--OFFENSIVE ODOUR--FERTILITY OF THE RACES WHEN\r\n    CROSSED--DIFFERENCES IN THE SEVERAL RACES IN PART DUE TO DESCENT FROM\r\n    DISTINCT SPECIES--DIFFERENCES IN THE SKULL AND TEETH--DIFFERENCES IN\r\n    THE BODY, IN CONSTITUTION--FEW IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN FIXED BY\r\n    SELECTION--DIRECT ACTION OF CLIMATE--WATER-DOGS WITH PALMATED\r\n    FEET--HISTORY OF THE CHANGES WHICH CERTAIN ENGLISH RACES OF THE DOG\r\n    HAVE GRADUALLY UNDERGONE THROUGH SELECTION--EXTINCTION OF THE LESS\r\n    IMPROVED SUB-BREEDS.\r\n\r\n    CATS, CROSSED WITH SEVERAL SPECIES--DIFFERENT BREEDS FOUND ONLY IN\r\n    SEPARATED COUNTRIES--DIRECT EFFECTS OF THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE--FERAL\r\n    CATS--INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY.\r\n\r\nThe first and chief point of interest in this chapter is, whether the\r\nnumerous domesticated varieties of the dog have descended from a single\r\nwild species, or from several. Some authors believe that all have descended\r\nfrom the wolf, or from the jackal, or from an unknown and extinct species.\r\nOthers again believe, and this of late has been the favourite tenet, that\r\nthey have descended from several species, extinct and recent, more or less\r\ncommingled together. We shall probably never be able to ascertain their\r\norigin with certainty. Palæontology[5] does not throw much light on the\r\nquestion, owing, on the one hand, to the close similarity of the skulls of\r\nextinct as well as living wolves and jackals, and owing on the other hand\r\nto the great dissimilarity of the skulls of the several breeds of the\r\ndomestic dogs. It seems, however, that remains have been found in the {16}\r\nlater tertiary deposits more like those of a large dog than of a wolf,\r\nwhich favours the belief of De Blainville that our dogs are the descendants\r\nof a single extinct species. On the other hand, some authors go so far as\r\nto assert that every chief domestic breed must have had its wild prototype.\r\nThis latter view is extremely improbable; it allows nothing for variation;\r\nit passes over the almost monstrous character of some of the breeds; and it\r\nalmost necessarily assumes, that a large number of species have become\r\nextinct since man domesticated the dog; whereas we plainly see that the\r\nmembers of the dog-family are extirpated by human agency with much\r\ndifficulty; even so recently as 1710 the wolf existed in so small an island\r\nas Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which have led various authors to infer that our dogs have\r\ndescended from more than one wild species are as follows.[6] Firstly, the\r\ngreat difference between the several breeds; but this will appear of\r\ncomparatively little weight, after we shall have seen how great are the\r\ndifferences between the several races of various domesticated animals which\r\ncertainly have descended from a single parent-form. Secondly, the more\r\nimportant fact that, at the most anciently known historical periods,\r\nseveral breeds of the dog existed, very unlike each other, and closely\r\nresembling or identical with breeds still alive.\r\n\r\nWe will briefly run back through the historical records. The materials are\r\nremarkably deficient between the fourteenth century and the Roman classical\r\nperiod.[7] At this earlier period {17} various breeds, namely hounds,\r\nhouse-dogs, lapdogs, &c., existed; but as Dr. Walther has remarked it is\r\nimpossible to recognise the greater number with any certainty. Youatt,\r\nhowever, gives a drawing of a beautiful sculpture of two greyhound puppies\r\nfrom the Villa of Antoninus. On an Assyrian monument, about 640 B.C., an\r\nenormous mastiff[8] is figured; and according to Sir H. Rawlinson (as I was\r\ninformed at the British Museum), similar dogs are still imported into this\r\nsame country. I have looked through the magnificent works of Lepsius and\r\nRosellini, and on the monuments from the fourth to the twelfth dynasties\r\n(_i.e._ from about 3400 B.C. to 2100 B.C.) several varieties of the dog are\r\nrepresented; most of them are allied to greyhounds; at the later of these\r\nperiods a dog resembling a hound is figured, with drooping ears, but with a\r\nlonger back and more pointed head than in our hounds. There is, also, a\r\nturnspit, with short and crooked legs, closely resembling the existing\r\nvariety; but this kind of monstrosity is so common with various animals, as\r\nwith the ancon sheep, and even, according to Rengger, with jaguars in\r\nParaguay, that it would be rash to look at the monumental animal as the\r\nparent of all our turnspits: Colonel Sykes[9] also has described an Indian\r\nPariah dog as presenting the same monstrous character. The most ancient dog\r\nrepresented on the Egyptian monuments is one of the most singular; it\r\nresembles a greyhound, but has long pointed ears and a short curled tail: a\r\nclosely allied variety still exists in Northern Africa; for Mr. E. Vernon\r\nHarcourt[10] states that the Arab boar-hound is \"an eccentric hieroglyphic\r\nanimal, such as Cheops once hunted with, somewhat resembling the rough\r\nScotch deer-hound; their tails are curled tight round on their backs, {18}\r\nand their ears stick out at right angles.\" With this most ancient variety a\r\npariah-like dog coexisted.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that, at a period between four and five thousand years ago,\r\nvarious breeds, viz. pariah dogs, greyhounds, common hounds, mastiffs,\r\nhouse-dogs, lapdogs, and turnspits, existed, more or less closely\r\nresembling our present breeds. But there is not sufficient evidence that\r\nany of these ancient dogs belonged to the same identical sub-varieties with\r\nour present dogs.[11] As long as man was believed to have existed on this\r\nearth only about 6000 years, this fact of the great diversity of the breeds\r\nat so early a period was an argument of much weight that they had proceeded\r\nfrom several wild sources, for there would not have been sufficient time\r\nfor their divergence and modification. But now that we know, from the\r\ndiscovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of extinct animals in\r\ndistricts which have since undergone great geographical changes, that man\r\nhas existed for an incomparably longer period, and bearing in mind that the\r\nmost barbarous nations possess domestic dogs, the argument from\r\ninsufficient time falls away greatly in value.\r\n\r\nLong before the period of any historical record the dog was domesticated in\r\nEurope. In the Danish Middens of the Neolithic or Newer Stone period, bones\r\nof a canine animal are imbedded, and Steenstrup ingeniously argues that\r\nthese belonged to a domestic dog; for a very large proportion of the bones\r\nof birds preserved in the refuse, consists of long bones, which it was\r\nfound on trial dogs cannot devour.[12] This ancient dog was succeeded in\r\nDenmark during the Bronze period by a larger kind, presenting certain\r\ndifferences, and this again during the Iron period, by a still larger kind.\r\nIn Switzerland, we hear {19} from Prof. Rütimeyer,[13] that during the\r\nNeolithic period a domesticated dog of middle size existed, which in its\r\nskull was about equally remote from the wolf and jackal, and partook of the\r\ncharacters of our hounds and setters or spaniels (Jagdhund und\r\nWachtelhund). Rütimeyer insists strongly on the constancy of form during a\r\nvery long period of time of this the most ancient known dog. During the\r\nBronze period a larger dog appeared, and this closely resembled in its jaw\r\na dog of the same age in Denmark. Remains of two notably distinct varieties\r\nof the dog were found by Schmerling in a cave;[14] but their age cannot be\r\npositively determined.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a single race, remarkably constant in form during the\r\nwhole Neolithic period, is an interesting fact in contrast with what we see\r\nof the changes which the races underwent during the period of the\r\nsuccessive Egyptian monuments, and in contrast with our existing dogs. The\r\ncharacter of this animal during the Neolithic period, as given by\r\nRütimeyer, supports De Blainville's view that our varieties have descended\r\nfrom an unknown and extinct form. But we should not forget that we know\r\nnothing with respect to the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the\r\nworld. The succession of the different kinds of dogs in Switzerland and\r\nDenmark is thought to be due to the immigration of conquering tribes\r\nbringing with them their dogs; and this view accords with the belief that\r\ndifferent wild canine animals were domesticated in different regions.\r\nIndependently of the immigration of new races of man, we know from the\r\nwide-spread presence of bronze, composed of an alloy of tin, how much\r\ncommerce there must have been throughout Europe at an extremely remote\r\nperiod, and dogs would then probably have been bartered. At the present\r\ntime, amongst the savages of the interior of Guiana, the Taruma Indians are\r\nconsidered the best trainers of dogs, and possess a large breed, which they\r\nbarter at a high price with other tribes.[15]\r\n\r\nThe main argument in favour of the several breeds of the {20} dog being the\r\ndescendants of distinct wild stocks, is their resemblance in various\r\ncountries to distinct species still existing there. It must, however, be\r\nadmitted that the comparison between the wild and domesticated animal has\r\nbeen made but in few cases with sufficient exactness. Before entering on\r\ndetails, it will be well to show that there is no a priori difficulty in\r\nthe belief that several canine species have been domesticated; for there is\r\nmuch difficulty in this respect with some other domestic quadrupeds and\r\nbirds. Members of the dog family inhabit nearly the whole world; and\r\nseveral species agree pretty closely in habits and structure with our\r\nseveral domesticated dogs. Mr. Galton has shown[16] how fond savages are of\r\nkeeping and taming animals of all kinds. Social animals are the most easily\r\nsubjugated by man, and several species of Canidæ hunt in packs. It deserves\r\nnotice, as bearing on other animals as well as on the dog, that at an\r\nextremely ancient period, when man first entered any country, the animals\r\nliving there would have felt no instinctive or inherited fear of him, and\r\nwould consequently have been tamed far more easily than at present. For\r\ninstance, when the Falkland Islands were first visited by man, the large\r\nwolf-like dog (_Canis antarcticus_) fearlessly came to meet Byron's\r\nsailors, who, mistaking this ignorant curiosity for ferocity, ran into the\r\nwater to avoid them: even recently a man, by holding a piece of meat in one\r\nhand and a knife in the other, could sometimes stick them at night. On an\r\nisland in the Sea of Aral, when first discovered by Butakoff, the saigak\r\nantelopes, which are \"generally very timid and watchful, did not fly from\r\nus, but on the contrary looked at us with a sort of curiosity.\" So, again,\r\non the shores of the Mauritius, the manatee was not at first in the least\r\nafraid of man, and thus it has been in several quarters of the world with\r\nseals and the morse. I have elsewhere shown[17] how slowly the native birds\r\nof several islands have acquired and inherited a salutary dread of man: at\r\nthe Galapagos Archipelago I pushed with the muzzle of my gun hawks from a\r\nbranch, and {21} held out a pitcher of water for other birds to alight on\r\nand drink. Quadrupeds and birds which have seldom been disturbed by man,\r\ndread him no more than do our English birds the cows or horses grazing in\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nIt is a more important consideration that several canine species evince (as\r\nwill be shown in a future chapter) no strong repugnance or inability to\r\nbreed under confinement; and the incapacity to breed under confinement is\r\none of the commonest bars to domestication. Lastly, savages set the highest\r\nvalue, as we shall see in the chapter on Selection, on dogs: even\r\nhalf-tamed animals are highly useful to them: the Indians of North America\r\ncross their half-wild dogs with wolves, and thus render them even wilder\r\nthan before, but bolder: the savages of Guiana catch and partially tame and\r\nuse the whelps of two wild species of _Canis_, as do the savages of\r\nAustralia those of the wild Dingo. Mr. Philip King informs me that he once\r\ntrained a wild Dingo puppy to drive cattle, and found it very useful. From\r\nthese several considerations we see that there is no difficulty in\r\nbelieving that man might have domesticated various canine species in\r\ndifferent countries. It would indeed have been a strange fact if one\r\nspecies alone had been domesticated throughout the world.\r\n\r\nWe will now enter into details. The accurate and sagacious Richardson says,\r\n\"The resemblance between the Northern American wolves (_Canis lupus, var.\r\noccidentalis_) and the domestic dogs of the Indians is so great that the\r\nsize and strength of the wolf seems to be the only difference. I have more\r\nthan once mistaken a band of wolves for the dogs of a party of Indians; and\r\nthe howl of the animals of both species is prolonged so exactly in the same\r\nkey that even the practised ear of the Indian fails at times to\r\ndiscriminate them.\" He adds that the more northern Esquimaux dogs are not\r\nonly extremely like the grey wolves of the Arctic circle in form and\r\ncolour, but also nearly equal them in size. Dr. Kane has often seen in his\r\nteams of sledge-dogs the oblique eye (a character on which some naturalists\r\nlay great stress), the drooping tail, and scared look of the wolf. In\r\ndisposition the Esquimaux dogs differ little from wolves, and, according to\r\nDr. Hayes, they are capable of no attachment to man, and are so savage,\r\nthat {22} when hungry they will attack even their masters. According to\r\nKane they readily become feral. Their affinity is so close with wolves that\r\nthey frequently cross with them, and the Indians take the whelps of wolves\r\n\"to improve the breed of their dogs.\" The half-bred wolves sometimes\r\n(Lamare-Picquot) cannot be tamed, \"though this case is rare;\" but they do\r\nnot become thoroughly well broken in till the second or third generation.\r\nThese facts show that there can be but little, if any, sterility between\r\nthe Esquimaux dog and the wolf, for otherwise they would not be used to\r\nimprove the breed. As Dr. Hayes says of these dogs, \"reclaimed wolves they\r\ndoubtless are.\"[18]\r\n\r\nNorth America is inhabited by a second kind of wolf, the prairie-wolf\r\n(_Canis latrans_), which is now looked at by all naturalists as\r\nspecifically distinct from the common wolf; and is, according to Mr. J. K.\r\nLord, in some respects intermediate in habits between a wolf and a fox. Sir\r\nJ. Richardson, after describing the Hare Indian dog, which differs in many\r\nrespects from the Esquimaux dog, says, \"It bears the same relation to the\r\nprairie wolf that the Esquimaux dog does to the great grey wolf.\" He could,\r\nin fact, detect no marked difference between them; and Messrs. Nott and\r\nGliddon give additional details showing their close resemblance. The dogs\r\nderived from the above two aboriginal sources cross together and with the\r\nwild wolves, at least with the _C. occidentalis_, and with European dogs.\r\nIn Florida, according to Bartram, the black wolf-dog of the Indians differs\r\nin nothing from the wolves of that country except in barking.[19]\r\n\r\n{23}\r\n\r\nTurning to the southern parts of the New World, Columbus found two kinds of\r\ndogs in the West Indies; and Fernandez[20] describes three in Mexico: some\r\nof these native dogs were dumb--that is, did not bark. In Guiana it has\r\nbeen known since the time of Buffon that the natives cross their dogs with\r\nan aboriginal species, apparently the _Canis cancrivorus_. Sir R.\r\nSchomburgk, who has so carefully explored these regions, writes to me, \"I\r\nhave been repeatedly told by the Arawaak Indians, who reside near the\r\ncoast, that they cross their dogs with a wild species to improve the breed,\r\nand individual dogs have been shown to me which certainly resembled the _C.\r\ncancrivorus_ much more than the common breed. It is but seldom that the\r\nIndians keep the _C. cancrivorus_ for domestic purposes, nor is the Ai,\r\nanother species of wild dog, and which I consider to be identical with the\r\n_Dusicyon silvestris_ of H. Smith, now much used by the Arecunas for the\r\npurpose of hunting. The dogs of the Taruma Indians are quite distinct, and\r\nresemble Buffon's St. Domingo greyhound.\" It thus appears that the natives\r\nof Guiana have partially domesticated two aboriginal species, and still\r\ncross their dogs with them; these two species belong to a quite different\r\ntype from the North American and European wolves. A careful observer,\r\nRengger,[21] gives reasons for believing that a hairless dog was\r\ndomesticated when America was first visited by Europeans: some of these\r\ndogs in Paraguay are still dumb, and Tschudi[22] states that they suffer\r\nfrom cold in the Cordillera. This naked dog is, however, quite distinct\r\nfrom that found preserved in the ancient Peruvian burial-places, and\r\ndescribed by Tschudi, under the name of _Canis Ingæ_, as withstanding cold\r\nwell and as barking. It is not known whether these two distinct kinds of\r\ndog are the descendants of native species, and it might be argued that when\r\nman first migrated into America he brought with him from the Asiatic\r\ncontinent dogs {24} which had not learned to bark; but this view does not\r\nseem probable, as the natives along the line of their march from the north\r\nreclaimed, as we have seen, at least two N. American species of Canidæ.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Old World, some European dogs closely resemble the wolf;\r\nthus the shepherd dog of the plains of Hungary is white or reddish-brown,\r\nhas a sharp nose, short, erect ears, shaggy coat, and bushy tail, and so\r\nmuch resembles a wolf that Mr. Paget, who gives this description, says he\r\nhas known a Hungarian mistake a wolf for one of his own dogs. Jeitteles,\r\nalso, remarks on the close similarity of the Hungarian dog and wolf.\r\nShepherd dogs in Italy must anciently have closely resembled wolves, for\r\nColumella (vii. 12) advises that white dogs be kept, adding, \"pastor album\r\nprobat, ne pro lupo canem feriat.\" Several accounts have been given of dogs\r\nand wolves crossing naturally; and Pliny asserts that the Gauls tied their\r\nfemale dogs in the woods that they might cross with wolves.[23] The\r\nEuropean wolf differs slightly from that of North America, and has been\r\nranked by many naturalists as a distinct species. The common wolf of India\r\nis also by some esteemed as a third species, and here again we find a\r\nmarked resemblance between the pariah dogs of certain districts of India\r\nand the Indian wolf.[24]\r\n\r\nWith respect to Jackals, Isidore Geoffroy Saint Hilaire[25] says that not\r\none constant difference can be pointed out between their structure and that\r\nof the smaller races of dogs. They agree closely in habits: jackals, when\r\ntamed and called by their {25} master, wag their tails, crouch, and throw\r\nthemselves on their backs; they smell at the tails of dogs, and void their\r\nurine sideways.[26] A number of excellent naturalists, from the time of\r\nGüldenstädt to that of Ehrenberg, Hemprich, and Cretzschmar, have expressed\r\nthemselves in the strongest terms with respect to the resemblance of the\r\nhalf-domestic dogs of Asia and Egypt to jackals. M. Nordmann, for instance,\r\nsays, \"Les chiens d'Awhasie ressemblent étonnamment à des chacals.\"\r\nEhrenberg[27] asserts that the domestic dogs of Lower Egypt, and certain\r\nmummied dogs, have for their wild type a species of wolf (_C. lupaster_) of\r\nthe country; whereas the domestic dogs of Nubia and certain other mummied\r\ndogs have the closest relation to a wild species of the same country, viz.\r\n_C. sabbar_, which is only a form of the common jackal. Pallas asserts that\r\njackals and dogs sometimes naturally cross in the East; and a case is on\r\nrecord in Algeria.[28] The greater number of naturalists divide the jackals\r\nof Asia and Africa into several species, but some few rank them all as one.\r\n\r\nI may add that the domestic dogs on the coast of Guinea are fox-like\r\nanimals, and are dumb.[29] On the east coast of Africa, between lat. 4° and\r\n6° south, and about ten days' journey in the interior, a semi-domestic dog,\r\nas the Rev. S. Erhardt informs me, is kept, which the natives assert is\r\nderived from a similar wild animal. Lichtenstein[30] says that the dogs of\r\nthe Bosjemans present a striking resemblance even in colour (excepting the\r\nblack stripe down the back) with the _C. mesomelas_ of South Africa. Mr. E.\r\nLayard informs me that he has seen a Caffre dog which closely resembled an\r\nEsquimaux dog. In Australia the Dingo is both domesticated and wild; though\r\nthis animal may have been introduced aboriginally by man, yet it must be\r\nconsidered as almost an endemic form, for its remains have been found in a\r\nsimilar state of preservation and associated with {26} extinct mammals, so\r\nthat its introduction must have been ancient.[31]\r\n\r\nFrom this resemblance in several countries of the half-domesticated dogs to\r\nthe wild species still living there,--from the facility with which they can\r\noften be crossed together,--from even half-tamed animals being so much\r\nvalued by savages,--and from the other circumstances previously remarked on\r\nwhich favour their domestication, it is highly probable that the domestic\r\ndogs of the world have descended from two good species of wolf (viz. _C.\r\nlupus_ and _C. latrans_), and from two or three other doubtful species of\r\nwolves (namely, the European, Indian, and North African forms); from at\r\nleast one or two South American canine species; from several races or\r\nspecies of the jackal; and perhaps from one or more extinct species. Those\r\nauthors who attribute great influence to the action of climate by itself\r\nmay thus account for the resemblance of the domesticated dogs and native\r\nanimals in the same countries; but I know of no facts supporting the belief\r\nin so powerful an action of climate.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be objected to the view of several canine species having been\r\nanciently domesticated, that these animals are tamed with difficulty: facts\r\nhave been already given on this head, but I may add that the young of the\r\n_Canis primævus_ of India were tamed by Mr. Hodgson,[32] and became as\r\nsensible to caresses, and manifested as much intelligence, as any sporting\r\ndog of the same age. There is not much difference, as we have already shown\r\nand shall immediately further see, in habits between the domestic dogs of\r\nthe North American Indians and the wolves of that country, or between the\r\nEastern pariah dogs and jackals, or between the dogs which have run wild in\r\nvarious countries and the several natural species of the family. The habit\r\nof barking, however, which is almost universal with domesticated {27} dogs,\r\nand which does not characterise a single natural species of the family,\r\nseems an exception; but this habit is soon lost and soon reacquired. The\r\ncase of the wild dogs on the island of Juan Fernandez having become dumb\r\nhas often been quoted, and there is reason to believe[33] that the dumbness\r\nensued in the course of thirty-three years; on the other hand, dogs taken\r\nfrom this island by Ulloa slowly reacquired the habit of barking. The\r\nMackenzie-river dogs, of the _Canis latrans_ type, when brought to England,\r\nnever learned to bark properly; but one born in the Zoological Gardens[34]\r\n\"made his voice sound as loudly as any other dog of the same age and size.\"\r\nAccording to Professor Nillson,[35] a wolf-whelp reared by a bitch barks.\r\nI. Geoffroy Saint Hilaire exhibited a jackal which barked with the same\r\ntone as any common dog.[36] An interesting account has been given by Mr. G.\r\nClarke[37] of some dogs run wild on Juan de Nova, in the Indian Ocean;\r\n\"they had entirely lost the faculty of barking; they had no inclination for\r\nthe company of other dogs, nor did they acquire their voice,\" during a\r\ncaptivity of several months. On the island they \"congregate in vast packs,\r\nand catch sea-birds with as much address as foxes could display.\" The feral\r\ndogs of La Plata have not become dumb; they are of large size, hunt single\r\nor in packs, and burrow holes for their young.[38] In these habits the\r\nferal dogs of La Plata resemble wolves and jackals; both of which hunt\r\neither singly or in packs, and burrow holes.[39] These feral dogs have not\r\nbecome uniform in colour on Juan Fernandez, Juan de Nova, or La Plata.[40]\r\nIn Cuba the feral dogs are described by Poeppig as nearly all\r\nmouse-coloured, with short ears and light-blue eyes. {28} In St. Domingo,\r\nCol. Ham. Smith says[41] that the feral dogs are very large, like\r\ngreyhounds, of a uniform pale blue-ash, with small ears, and large\r\nlight-brown eyes. Even the wild Dingo, though so anciently naturalised in\r\nAustralia, \"varies considerably in colour,\" as I am informed by Mr. P. P.\r\nKing: a half-bred Dingo reared in England[42] showed signs of wishing to\r\nburrow.\r\n\r\n    From the several foregoing facts we see that reversion in the feral\r\n    state gives no indication of the colour or size of the aboriginal\r\n    parent-species. One fact, however, with respect to the colouring of\r\n    domestic dogs, I at one time hoped might have thrown some light on\r\n    their origin; and it is worth giving, as showing how colouring follows\r\n    laws, even in so anciently and thoroughly domesticated an animal as the\r\n    dog. Black dogs with tan-coloured feet, whatever breed they may belong\r\n    to, almost invariably have a tan-coloured spot on the upper and inner\r\n    corners of each eye, and their lips are generally thus coloured. I have\r\n    seen only two exceptions to this rule, namely, in a spaniel and\r\n    terrier. Dogs of a light-brown colour often have a lighter,\r\n    yellowish-brown spot over the eyes; sometimes the spot is white, and in\r\n    a mongrel terrier the spot was black. Mr. Waring kindly examined for me\r\n    a stud of fifteen greyhounds in Suffolk: eleven of them were black, or\r\n    black and white, or brindled, and these had no eye-spots; but three\r\n    were red and one slaty-blue, and these four had dark-coloured spots\r\n    over their eyes. Although the spots thus sometimes differ in colour,\r\n    they strongly tend to be tan-coloured; this is proved by my having seen\r\n    four spaniels, a setter, two Yorkshire shepherd dogs, a large mongrel,\r\n    and some fox-hounds, coloured black and white, with not a trace of\r\n    tan-colour, excepting the spots over the eyes, and sometimes a little\r\n    on the feet. These latter cases, and many others, show plainly that the\r\n    colour of the feet and the eye-spots are in some way correlated. I have\r\n    noticed, in various breeds, every gradation, from the whole face being\r\n    tan-coloured, to a complete ring round the eyes, to a minute spot over\r\n    the inner and upper corners. The spots occur in various sub-breeds of\r\n    terriers and spaniels; in setters; in hounds of various kinds,\r\n    including the turnspit-like German badger-hound; in shepherd dogs; in a\r\n    mongrel, of which neither parent had the spots; in one pure bulldog,\r\n    though the spots were in this case almost white; and in\r\n    greyhounds,--but true black-and-tan greyhounds are excessively rare;\r\n    nevertheless I have been assured by Mr. Warwick, that one ran at the\r\n    Caledonian Champion meeting of April, 1860, and was \"marked precisely\r\n    like a black-and-tan terrier.\" Mr. Swinhoe at my request looked at the\r\n    dogs in China, at Amoy, and he soon noticed a brown dog with yellow\r\n    spots over the eyes. Colonel H. Smith[43] figures the magnificent black\r\n    mastiff of Thibet with a {29} tan-coloured stripe over the eyes, feet,\r\n    and chaps; and what is more singular, he figures the Alco, or native\r\n    domestic dog of Mexico, as black and white, with narrow tan-coloured\r\n    rings round the eyes; at the Exhibition of dogs in London, May, 1863, a\r\n    so-called forest-dog from North-West Mexico was shown, which had pale\r\n    tan-coloured spots over the eyes. The occurrence of these tan-coloured\r\n    spots in dogs of such extremely different breeds, living in various\r\n    parts of the world, makes the fact highly remarkable.\r\n\r\n    We shall hereafter see, especially in the chapter on Pigeons, that\r\n    coloured marks are strongly inherited, and that they often aid us in\r\n    discovering the primitive forms of our domestic races. Hence, if any\r\n    wild canine species had distinctly exhibited the tan-coloured spots\r\n    over the eyes, it might have been argued that this was the parent-form\r\n    of nearly all our domestic races. But after looking at many coloured\r\n    plates, and through the whole collection of skins in the British\r\n    Museum, I can find no species thus marked. It is no doubt possible that\r\n    some extinct species was thus coloured. On the other hand, in looking\r\n    at the various species, there seems to be a tolerably plain correlation\r\n    between tan-coloured legs and face; and less frequently between black\r\n    legs and a black face; and this general rule of colouring explains to a\r\n    certain extent the above-given cases of correlation between the\r\n    eye-spots and the colour of the feet. Moreover, some jackals and foxes\r\n    have a trace of a white ring round their eyes, as in _C. mesomelas_,\r\n    _C. aureus_, and (judging from Colonel Ham. Smith's drawing) in _C.\r\n    alopex_ and _C. thaleb_. Other species have a trace of a black line\r\n    over the corners of the eyes, as in _C. variegatus_,\r\n    _cinereo-variegatus_, and _fulvus_, and the wild Dingo. Hence I am\r\n    inclined to conclude that a tendency for tan-coloured spots to appear\r\n    over the eyes in the various breeds of dogs, is analogous to the case\r\n    observed by Desmarest, namely, that when any white appears on a dog the\r\n    tip of the tail is always white, \"de manière a rappeler la tacho\r\n    terminale de même couleur, qui caractérise la plupart des Canidées\r\n    sauvages.\"[44]\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that our domestic dogs cannot be descended from wolves\r\nor jackals, because their periods of gestation are different. The supposed\r\ndifference rests on statements made by Buffon, Gilibert, Bechstein, and\r\nothers; but these are now known to be erroneous; and the period is found to\r\nagree in the wolf, jackal, and dog, as closely as could be expected, for it\r\nis often in some degree variable.[45] Tessier, who {30} has closely\r\nattended to this subject, allows a difference of four days in the gestation\r\nof the dog. The Rev. W. D. Fox has given me three carefully recorded cases\r\nof retrievers, in which the bitch was put only once to the dog; and not\r\ncounting this day, but counting that of parturition, the periods were\r\nfifty-nine, sixty-two, and sixty-seven days. The average period is\r\nsixty-three days; but Bellingeri states that this holds good only with\r\nlarge dogs; and that for small races it is from sixty to sixty-three days;\r\nMr. Eyton of Eyton, who has had much experience with dogs, also informs me\r\nthat the time is apt to be longer with large than with small dogs.\r\n\r\nF. Cuvier has objected that the jackal would not have been domesticated on\r\naccount of its offensive smell; but savages are not sensitive in this\r\nrespect. The degree of odour, also, differs in the different kinds of\r\njackal;[46] and Colonel H. Smith makes a sectional division of the group\r\nwith one character dependent on not being offensive. On the other hand,\r\ndogs--for instance, rough and smooth terriers--differ much in this respect;\r\nand M. Godron states that the hairless so-called Turkish dog is more\r\nodoriferous than other dogs. Isidore Geoffroy[47] gave to a dog the same\r\nodour as that from a jackal by feeding it on raw flesh.\r\n\r\nThe belief that our dogs are descended from wolves, jackals, South American\r\nCanidæ, and other species, suggests a far more important difficulty. These\r\nanimals in their undomesticated state, judging from a widely-spread\r\nanalogy, would have been in some degree sterile if intercrossed; and such\r\nsterility will be admitted as almost certain by all those who believe that\r\nthe lessened fertility of crossed forms is an infallible criterion of\r\nspecific distinctness. Anyhow these animals keep distinct in the countries\r\nwhich they inhabit in common. On the other hand, all domestic dogs, which\r\nare here supposed to be descended {31} from several distinct species, are,\r\nas far as is known, mutually fertile together. But, as Broca has well\r\nremarked,[48] the fertility of successive generations of mongrel dogs has\r\nnever been scrutinised with that care which is thought indispensable when\r\nspecies are crossed. The few facts leading to the conclusion that the\r\nsexual feelings and reproductive powers differ in the several races of the\r\ndog when crossed are (passing over mere size as rendering propagation\r\ndifficult) as follows: the Mexican Alco[49] apparently dislikes dogs of\r\nother kinds, but this perhaps is not strictly a sexual feeling; the\r\nhairless endemic dog of Paraguay, according to Rengger, mixes less with the\r\nEuropean races than these do with each other; the Spitz-dog in Germany is\r\nsaid to receive the fox more readily than do other breeds; and Dr. Hodgkin\r\nstates that a female Dingo in England attracted the male wild foxes. If\r\nthese latter statements can be trusted, they prove some degree of sexual\r\ndifference in the breeds of the dog. But the fact remains that our domestic\r\ndogs, differing so widely as they do in external structure, are far more\r\nfertile together than we have reason to believe their supposed wild parents\r\nwould have been. Pallas assumes[50] that a long course of domestication\r\neliminates that sterility which the parent-species would have exhibited if\r\nonly lately captured; no distinct facts are recorded in support of this\r\nhypothesis; but the evidence seems to me so strong (independently of the\r\nevidence derived from other domesticated animals) in favour of our domestic\r\ndogs having descended from several wild stocks, that I am led to admit the\r\ntruth of this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThere is another and closely allied difficulty consequent on the doctrine\r\nof the descent of our domestic dogs from several wild species, namely, that\r\nthey do not seem to be perfectly fertile with their supposed parents. But\r\nthe experiment has not been quite fairly tried; the Hungarian dog, for\r\ninstance, {32} which in external appearance so closely resembles the\r\nEuropean wolf, ought to be crossed with this wolf; and the pariah-dogs of\r\nIndia with Indian wolves and jackals; and so in other cases. That the\r\nsterility is very slight between certain dogs and wolves and other Canidæ\r\nis shown by savages taking the trouble to cross them. Buffon got four\r\nsuccessive generations from the wolf and dog, and the mongrels were\r\nperfectly fertile together.[51] But more lately M. Flourens states\r\npositively as the result of his numerous experiments that hybrids from the\r\nwolf and dog, crossed _inter se_, become sterile at the third generation,\r\nand those from the jackal and dog at the fourth generation.[52] But these\r\nanimals were closely confined; and many wild animals, as we shall see in a\r\nfuture chapter, are rendered by confinement in some degree or even utterly\r\nsterile. The Dingo, which breeds freely in Australia with our imported\r\ndogs, would not breed though repeatedly crossed in the Jardin des\r\nPlantes.[53] Some hounds from Central Africa, brought home by Major Denham,\r\nnever bred in the Tower of London;[54] and a similar tendency to sterility\r\nmight be transmitted to the hybrid offspring of a wild animal. Moreover, it\r\nappears that in M. Flourens' experiments the hybrids were closely bred in\r\nand in for three or four generations; but this circumstance, although it\r\nwould almost certainly increase the tendency to sterility, would hardly\r\naccount for the final result, even though aided by close confinement,\r\nunless there had been some original tendency to lessened fertility. Several\r\nyears ago I saw confined in the Zoological Gardens of London a female\r\nhybrid from an English dog and jackal, which even in this the first\r\ngeneration was so sterile that, as I was assured by {33} her keeper, she\r\ndid not fully exhibit her proper periods; but this case, from the numerous\r\ninstances of fertile hybrids from these two animals, was certainly\r\nexceptional. In almost all experiments on the crossing of animals there are\r\nso many causes of doubt, that it is extremely difficult to come to any\r\npositive conclusion. It would, however, appear, that those who believe that\r\nour dogs are descended from several species will have not only to admit\r\nthat their offspring after a long course of domestication generally lose\r\nall tendency to sterility when crossed together; but that between certain\r\nbreeds of dogs and some of their supposed aboriginal parents a certain\r\ndegree of sterility has been retained or possibly even acquired.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the difficulties in regard to fertility given in the last\r\ntwo paragraphs, when we reflect on the inherent improbability of man having\r\ndomesticated throughout the world one single species alone of so widely\r\ndistributed, so easily tamed, and so useful a group as the Canidæ; when we\r\nreflect on the extreme antiquity of the different breeds; and especially\r\nwhen we reflect on the close similarity, both in external structure and\r\nhabits, between the domestic dogs of various countries and the wild species\r\nstill inhabiting these same countries, the balance of evidence is strongly\r\nin favour of the multiple origin of our dogs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Differences between the several Breeds of the Dog._--If the several breeds\r\nhave descended from several wild stocks, their difference can obviously in\r\npart be explained by that of their parent-species. For instance, the form\r\nof the greyhound may be partly accounted for by descent from some such\r\nanimal as the slim Abyssinian _Canis simensis_,[55] with its elongated\r\nmuzzle; that of the larger dogs from the larger wolves, and the smaller and\r\nslighter dogs from jackals: and thus perhaps we may account for certain\r\nconstitutional and climatal differences. But it would be a great error to\r\nsuppose that there has not been in addition[56] a large amount of\r\nvariation. The intercrossing of the several aboriginal wild stocks, and of\r\nthe subsequently formed {34} races, has probably increased the total number\r\nof breeds, and, as we shall presently see, has greatly modified some of\r\nthem. But we cannot explain by crossing the origin of such extreme forms as\r\nthoroughbred greyhounds, bloodhounds, bulldogs, Blenheim spaniels,\r\nterriers, pugs, &c., unless we believe that forms equally or more strongly\r\ncharacterised in these different respects once existed in nature. But\r\nhardly any one has been bold enough to suppose that such unnatural forms\r\never did or could exist in a wild state. When compared with all known\r\nmembers of the family of Canidæ they betray a distinct and abnormal origin.\r\nNo instance is on record of such dogs as bloodhounds, spaniels, true\r\ngreyhounds having been kept by savages: they are the product of\r\nlong-continued civilization.\r\n\r\n    The number of breeds and sub-breeds of the dog is great: Youatt, for\r\n    instance, describes twelve kinds of greyhounds. I will not attempt to\r\n    enumerate or describe the varieties, for we cannot discriminate how\r\n    much of their difference is due to variation, and how much to descent\r\n    from different aboriginal stocks. But it may be worth while briefly to\r\n    mention some points. Commencing with the skull, Cuvier has admitted[57]\r\n    that in form the differences are \"plus fortes que celles d'aucunes\r\n    espèces sauvages d'un même genre naturel.\" The proportions of the\r\n    different bones; the curvature of the lower jaw, the position of the\r\n    condyles with respect to the plane of the teeth (on which F. Cuvier\r\n    founded his classification), and in mastiffs the shape of its posterior\r\n    branch; the shape of the zygomatic arch, and of the temporal fossæ; the\r\n    position of the occiput--all vary considerably.[58] The dog has\r\n    properly six pairs of molar teeth in the upper jaw, and seven in the\r\n    lower; but several naturalists have seen not rarely an additional pair\r\n    in the upper jaw;[59] and Professor Gervais says that there are dogs\r\n    \"qui ont sept paires de dents supérieures et huit inférieures.\". De\r\n    Blainville[60] has given full particulars on the frequency of these\r\n    deviations in the number of the teeth, and has shown that it is not\r\n    always the same tooth which is supernumerary. In short-muzzled races,\r\n    according to H. Müller,[61] the molar teeth stand obliquely, whilst in\r\n    long-muzzled races they are placed longitudinally, with open spaces\r\n    between them. The naked, so-called Egyptian or Turkish dog is extremely\r\n    deficient in its {35} teeth,[62]--sometimes having none except one\r\n    molar on each side; but this, though characteristic of the breed, must\r\n    be considered as a monstrosity. M. Girard,[63] who seems to have\r\n    attended closely to the subject, says that the period of the appearance\r\n    of the permanent teeth differs in different dogs, being earlier in\r\n    large dogs; thus the mastiff assumes its adult teeth in four or five\r\n    months, whilst in the spaniel the period is sometimes more than seven\r\n    or eight months.\r\n\r\n    With respect to minor differences little need be said. Isidore Geoffroy\r\n    has shown[64] that in size some dogs are six times as long (the tail\r\n    being excluded) as others; and that the height relatively to the length\r\n    of the body varies from between one to two, and one to nearly four. In\r\n    the Scotch deer-hound there is a striking and remarkable difference in\r\n    the size of the male and female.[65] Every one knows how the ears vary\r\n    in size in different breeds, and with their great development their\r\n    muscles become atrophied. Certain breeds of dogs are described as\r\n    having a deep furrow between the nostrils and lips. The caudal\r\n    vertebræ, according to F. Cuvier, on whose authority the two last\r\n    statements rest, vary in number; and the tail in shepherd dogs is\r\n    almost absent. The mammæ vary from seven to ten in number; Daubenton,\r\n    having examined twenty-one dogs, found eight with five mammæ on each\r\n    side; eight with four on each side; and the others with an unequal\r\n    number on the two sides.[66] Dogs have properly five toes in front and\r\n    four behind, but a fifth toe is often added; and F. Cuvier states that,\r\n    when a fifth toe is present, a fourth cuneiform bone is developed; and,\r\n    in this case, sometimes the great cuneiform bone is raised, and gives\r\n    on its inner side a large articular surface to the astragalus; so that\r\n    even the relative connection of the bones, the most constant of all\r\n    characters, varies. These modifications, however, in the feet of dogs\r\n    are not important, because they ought to be ranked, as De Blainville\r\n    has shown,[67] as monstrosities. Nevertheless they are interesting from\r\n    being correlated with the size of the body, for they occur much more\r\n    frequently with mastiffs and other large breeds than with small dogs.\r\n    Closely allied varieties, however, sometimes differ in this respect;\r\n    thus Mr. Hodgson states that the black-and-tan Lassa variety of the\r\n    Thibet mastiff has the fifth digit, whilst the Mustang sub-variety is\r\n    not thus characterised. The extent to which the skin is developed\r\n    between the toes varies much; but we shall return to this point. The\r\n    degree to which the various breeds differ in the perfection of their\r\n    senses, dispositions, and inherited habits is notorious to every one.\r\n    The breeds present some constitutional differences: the pulse, says\r\n    Youatt,[68] \"varies materially according to the breed, as well {36} as\r\n    to the size of the animal.\" Different breeds of dogs are subject in\r\n    different degrees to various diseases. They certainly become adapted to\r\n    different climates under which they have long existed. It is notorious\r\n    that most of our best European breeds deteriorate in India.[69] The\r\n    Rev. R. Everest[70] believes that no one has succeeded in keeping the\r\n    Newfoundland dog long alive in India; so it is, according to\r\n    Lichtenstein,[71] even at the Cape of Good Hope. The Thibet mastiff\r\n    degenerates on the plains of India, and can live only on the\r\n    mountains.[72] Lloyd[73] asserts that our bloodhounds and bulldogs have\r\n    been tried, and cannot withstand the cold of the northern European\r\n    forests.\r\n\r\nSeeing in how many characters the races of the dog differ from each other,\r\nand remembering Cuvier's admission that their skulls differ more than do\r\nthose of the species of any natural genus, and bearing in mind how closely\r\nthe bones of wolves, jackals, foxes, and other Canidæ agree, it is\r\nremarkable that we meet with the statement, repeated over and over again,\r\nthat the races of the dog differ in no important characters. A highly\r\ncompetent judge, Prof. Gervais,[74] admits, \"si l'on prenait sans contrôle\r\nles altérations dont chacun de ces organes est susceptible, on pourrait\r\ncroire qu'il y a entre les chiens domestiques des différences plus grandes\r\nque celles qui séparent ailleurs les espèces, quelquefois même les genres.\"\r\nSome of the differences above enumerated are in one respect of\r\ncomparatively little value, for they are not characteristic of distinct\r\nbreeds: no one pretends that such is the case with the additional molar\r\nteeth or with the number of mammæ; the additional digit is generally\r\npresent with mastiffs, and some of the more important differences in the\r\nskull and lower jaw are more or less characteristic of various breeds. But\r\nwe must not forget that the predominant power of selection has not been\r\napplied in any of these cases; we have variability in important parts, but\r\nthe differences have not been fixed by selection. Man {37} cares for the\r\nform and fleetness of his greyhounds, for the size of his mastiffs, for the\r\nstrength of the jaw in his bulldogs, &c.; but he cares nothing about the\r\nnumber of their molar teeth or mammæ or digits; nor do we know that\r\ndifferences in these organs are correlated with, or owe their development\r\nto, differences in other parts of the body about which man does care. Those\r\nwho have attended to the subject of selection will admit that, nature\r\nhaving given variability, man, if he so chose, could fix five toes to the\r\nhinder feet of certain breeds of dogs, as certainly as to the feet of his\r\nDorking-fowls: he could probably fix, but with much more difficulty, an\r\nadditional pair of molar teeth in either jaw, in the same way as he has\r\ngiven additional horns to certain breeds of sheep; if he wished to produce\r\na toothless breed of dogs, having the so-called Turkish dog with its\r\nimperfect teeth to work on, he could probably do so, for he has succeeded\r\nin making hornless breeds of cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the precise causes and steps by which the several races of\r\ndogs have come to differ so greatly from each other, we are, as in most\r\nother cases, profoundly ignorant. We may attribute part of the difference\r\nin external form and constitution to inheritance from distinct wild stocks,\r\nthat is to changes effected under nature before domestication. We must\r\nattribute something to the crossing of the several domestic and natural\r\nraces. I shall, however, soon recur to the crossing of races. We have\r\nalready seen how often savages cross their dogs with wild native species;\r\nand Pennant gives a curious account[75] of the manner in which Fochabers,\r\nin Scotland, was stocked \"with a multitude of curs of a most wolfish\r\naspect\" from a single hybrid-wolf brought into that district.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that climate to a certain extent directly modifies the\r\nforms of dogs. We have lately seen that several of our English breeds\r\ncannot live in India, and it is positively asserted that when bred there\r\nfor a few generations they degenerate not only in their mental faculties,\r\nbut in form. Captain Williamson,[76] who carefully attended to this\r\nsubject, states that \"hounds are the most rapid in their decline;\"\r\n\"greyhounds and {38} pointers, also, rapidly decline.\" But spaniels, after\r\neight or nine generations, and without a cross from Europe, are as good as\r\ntheir ancestors. Dr. Falconer informs me that bulldogs, which have been\r\nknown, when first brought into the country, to pin down even an elephant by\r\nits trunk, not only fall off after two of three generations in pluck and\r\nferocity, but lose the under-hung character of their lower jaws; their\r\nmuzzles become finer and their bodies lighter. English dogs imported into\r\nIndia are so valuable that probably due care has been taken to prevent\r\ntheir crossing with native dogs; so that the deterioration cannot be thus\r\naccounted for. The Rev. R. Everest informs me that he obtained a pair of\r\nsetters, born in India, which perfectly resembled their Scotch parents: he\r\nraised several litters from them in Delhi, taking the most stringent\r\nprecautions to prevent a cross, but he never succeeded, though this was\r\nonly the second generation in India, in obtaining a single young dog like\r\nits parents in size or make; their nostrils were more contracted, their\r\nnoses more pointed, their size inferior, and their limbs more slender. This\r\nremarkable tendency to rapid deterioration in European dogs subjected to\r\nthe climate of India, may perhaps partly be accounted for by the tendency\r\nto reversion to a primordial condition which many animals exhibit, as we\r\nshall see in a future chapter, when exposed to new conditions of life.\r\n\r\nSome of the peculiarities characteristic of the several breeds of the dog\r\nhave probably arisen suddenly, and, though strictly inherited, may be\r\ncalled monstrosities; for instance, the shape of the legs and body in the\r\nturnspit of Europe and India; the shape of the head and the under-hanging\r\njaw in the bull and pug-dog, so alike in this one respect and so unlike in\r\nall others. A peculiarity suddenly arising, and therefore in one sense\r\ndeserving to be called a monstrosity, may, however, be increased and fixed\r\nby man's selection. We can hardly doubt that long-continued training, as\r\nwith the greyhound in coursing hares, as with water-dogs in swimming--and\r\nthe want of exercise, in the case of lapdogs--must have produced some\r\ndirect effect on their structure and instincts. But we shall immediately\r\nsee that the most potent cause of change has probably been the selection,\r\nboth methodical and unconscious, of slight individual differences,--the\r\n{39} latter kind of selection resulting from the occasional preservation,\r\nduring hundreds of generations, of those individual dogs which were the\r\nmost useful to man for certain purposes and under certain conditions of\r\nlife. In a future chapter on Selection I shall show that even barbarians\r\nattend closely to the qualities of their dogs. This unconscious selection\r\nby man would lie aided by a kind of natural selection; for the dogs of\r\nsavages have partly to gain their own subsistence; for instance, in\r\nAustralia, as we hear from Mr. Nind,[77] the dogs are sometimes compelled\r\nby want to leave their masters and provide for themselves; but in a few\r\ndays they generally return. And we may infer that dogs of different shapes,\r\nsizes, and habits, would have best chance of surviving under different\r\ncircumstances,--on open, sterile plains, where they have to run down their\r\nown prey,--on rocky coasts, where they have to feed on crabs and fish left\r\nin the tidal pools, as in the case of New Guinea and Tierra del Fuego. In\r\nthis latter country, as I am informed by Mr. Bridges, the Catechist to the\r\nMission, the dogs turn over the stones on the shore to catch the\r\ncrustaceans which lie beneath, and they \"are clever enough to knock off the\r\nshell-fish at a first blow;\" for if this be not done, shell-fish are well\r\nknown to have an almost invincible power of adhesion.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that dogs differ in the degree to which their\r\nfeet are webbed. In dogs of the Newfoundland breed, which are eminently\r\naquatic in their habits, the skin, according to Isidore Geoffroy,[78]\r\nextends to the third phalanges, whilst in ordinary dogs it extends only to\r\nthe second. In two Newfoundland dogs which I examined, when the toes were\r\nstretched apart and viewed on the under side, the skin extended in a nearly\r\nstraight line between the outer margins of the balls of the toes; whereas,\r\nin two terriers of distinct sub-breeds, the skin viewed in the same manner\r\nwas deeply scooped out. In Canada there is a dog which is peculiar to the\r\ncountry and common there, and this has \"half-webbed feet and is fond of the\r\nwater.\"[79] English otter-hounds are said to have webbed feet: a friend\r\nexamined for me the feet of two, in comparison {40} with the feet of some\r\nharriers and bloodhounds; he found the skin variable in extent in all, but\r\nmore developed in the otter than in the other hounds.[80] As aquatic\r\nanimals which belong to quite different orders have webbed feet, there can\r\nbe no doubt that this structure would be serviceable to dogs that frequent\r\nthe water. We may confidently infer that no man ever selected his\r\nwater-dogs by the extent to which the skin was developed between their\r\ntoes; but what he does, is to preserve and breed from those individuals\r\nwhich hunt best in the water, or best retrieve wounded game, and thus he\r\nunconsciously selects dogs with feet slightly better webbed. Man thus\r\nclosely imitates Natural Selection. We have an excellent illustration of\r\nthis same process in North America, where, according to Sir J.\r\nRichardson,[81] all the wolves, foxes, and aboriginal domestic dogs have\r\ntheir feet broader than in the corresponding species of the Old World, and\r\n\"well calculated for running on the snow.\" Now, in these Arctic regions,\r\nthe life or death of every animal will often depend on its success in\r\nhunting over the snow when softened; and this will in part depend on the\r\nfeet being broad; yet they must not be so broad as to interfere with the\r\nactivity of the animal when the ground is sticky, or with its power of\r\nburrowing holes, or with other habits of life.\r\n\r\nAs changes in domestic breeds which take place so slowly as not to be\r\nnoticed at any one period, whether due to the selection of individual\r\nvariations or of differences resulting from crosses, are most important in\r\nunderstanding the origin of our domestic productions, and likewise in\r\nthrowing indirect light on the changes effected under nature, I will give\r\nin detail such cases as I have been able to collect. Lawrence,[82] who paid\r\nparticular attention to the history of the foxhound, writing in 1829, says\r\nthat between eighty and ninety years before \"an entirely new foxhound was\r\nraised through the breeder's art,\" the ears of the old southern hound being\r\nreduced, the bone and bulk lightened, the waist increased in length, and\r\nthe stature {41} somewhat added to. It is believed that this was effected\r\nby a cross with the greyhound. With respect to this latter dog, Youatt,[83]\r\nwho is generally cautious in his statements, says that the greyhound within\r\nthe last fifty years, that is before the commencement of the present\r\ncentury, \"assumed a somewhat different character from that which he once\r\npossessed. He is now distinguished by a beautiful symmetry of form, of\r\nwhich he could not once boast, and he has even superior speed to that which\r\nhe formerly exhibited. He is no longer used to struggle with deer, but\r\ncontends with his fellows over a shorter and speedier course.\" An able\r\nwriter[84] believes that our English greyhounds are the descendants,\r\n_progressively improved_, of the large rough greyhounds which existed in\r\nScotland so early as the third century. A cross at some former period with\r\nthe Italian greyhound has been suspected; but this seems hardly probable,\r\nconsidering the feebleness of this latter breed. Lord Orford, as is well\r\nknown, crossed his famous greyhounds, which failed in courage, with a\r\nbulldog--this breed being-chosen from being deficient in the power of\r\nscent; \"after the sixth or seventh generation,\" says Youatt, \"there was not\r\na vestige left of the form of the bulldog, but his courage and indomitable\r\nperseverance remained.\"\r\n\r\nYouatt infers, from a comparison of an old picture of King Charles's\r\nspaniels with the living dog, that \"the breed of the present day is\r\nmaterially altered for the worse:\" the muzzle has become shorter, the\r\nforehead more prominent, and the eyes larger: the changes in this case have\r\nprobably been due to simple selection. The setter, as this author remarks\r\nin another place, \"is evidently the large spaniel improved to his present\r\npeculiar size and beauty, and taught another way of marking his game. If\r\nthe form of the dog were not sufficiently satisfactory on this point, we\r\nmight have recourse to history:\" he then refers to a document dated 1685\r\nbearing on this subject, and adds that the pure Irish setter shows no signs\r\nof a cross with the pointer, which some authors suspect has been the case\r\nwith the English setter. Another writer[85] remarks {42} that, if the\r\nmastiff and English bulldog had formerly been as distinct as they are at\r\nthe present time (_i.e._ 1828), so accurate an observer as the poet Gay\r\n(who was the author of 'Rural Sports' in 1711) would have spoken in his\r\nFable of the _Bull and the Bulldog_, and not of the _Bull and the Mastiff_.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the fancy bulldogs of the present day, now that\r\nthey are not used for bull-baiting, have become greatly reduced in size,\r\nwithout any express intention on the part of the breeder. Our pointers are\r\ncertainly descended from a Spanish breed, as even their names, Don, Ponto,\r\nCarlos, &c., would show: it is said that they were not known in England\r\nbefore the Revolution in 1688;[86] but the breed since its introduction has\r\nbeen much modified, for Mr. Borrow, who is a sportsman and knows Spain\r\nintimately well, informs me that he has not seen in that country any breed\r\n\"corresponding in figure with the English pointer; but there are genuine\r\npointers near Xeres which have been imported by English gentlemen.\" A\r\nnearly parallel case is offered by the Newfoundland dog, which was\r\ncertainly brought into England from that country, but which has since been\r\nso much modified that, as several writers have observed, it does not now\r\nclosely resemble any existing native dog in Newfoundland.[87]\r\n\r\nThese several cases of slow and gradual changes in our English dogs possess\r\nsome interest; for though the changes have generally, but not invariably,\r\nbeen caused by one or two crosses with a distinct breed, yet we may feel\r\nsure, from the well-known extreme variability of crossed breeds, that\r\nrigorous and long-continued selection must have been practised, in order to\r\nimprove them in a definite manner. As soon as any strain or family became\r\nslightly improved or better adapted to altered circumstances, it would tend\r\nto supplant the older and less improved strains. For instance, as soon as\r\nthe old foxhound was improved by a cross with the greyhound, or by simple\r\nselection, and assumed its present character--and the change was probably\r\nrequired by {43} the increased fleetness of our hunters--it rapidly spread\r\nthroughout the country, and is now everywhere nearly uniform. But the\r\nprocess of improvement is still going on, for every one tries to improve\r\nhis strain by occasionally procuring dogs from the best kennels. Through\r\nthis process of gradual substitution the old English hound has been lost;\r\nand so it has been with the old Irish greyhound and apparently with the old\r\nEnglish bulldog. But the extinction of former breeds is apparently aided by\r\nanother cause; for whenever a breed is kept in scanty numbers, as at\r\npresent with the bloodhound, it is reared with difficulty, and this\r\napparently is due to the evil effects of long-continued close\r\ninterbreeding. As several breeds of the dog have been slightly but sensibly\r\nmodified within so short a period as the last one or two centuries, by the\r\nselection of the best individual dogs, modified in many cases by crosses\r\nwith other breeds; and as we shall hereafter see that the breeding of dogs\r\nwas attended to in ancient times, as it still is by savages, we may\r\nconclude that we have in selection, even if only occasionally practised, a\r\npotent means of modification.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC CATS.\r\n\r\nCats have been domesticated in the East from an ancient period; Mr. Blyth\r\ninforms me that they are mentioned in a Sanskrit writing 2000 years old,\r\nand in Egypt their antiquity is known to be even greater, as shown by\r\nmonumental drawings and their mummied bodies. These mummies, according to\r\nDe Blainville[88] who has particularly studied the subject, belong to no\r\nless than three species, namely, _F. caligulata_, _bubastes_, and _chaus_.\r\nThe two former species are said to be still found, both wild and\r\ndomesticated, in parts of Egypt. _F. caligulata_ presents a difference in\r\nthe first inferior milk molar tooth, as compared with the domestic cats of\r\nEurope, which makes De Blainville conclude that it is not one of the\r\nparent-forms of our cats. Several naturalists, as Pallas, Temminck, Blyth,\r\nbelieve that domestic cats are the descendants of several species {44}\r\ncommingled: it is certain that cats cross readily with various wild\r\nspecies, and it would appear that the character of the domestic breeds has,\r\nat least in some cases, been thus affected. Sir W. Jardine has no doubt\r\nthat, \"in the north of Scotland, there has been occasional crossing with\r\nour native species (_F. sylvestris_), and that the result of these crosses\r\nhas been kept in our houses. I have seen,\" he adds, \"many cats very closely\r\nresembling the wild cat, and one or two that could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished from it.\" Mr. Blyth[89] remarks on this passage, \"but such\r\ncats are never seen in the southern parts of England; still, as compared\r\nwith any Indian tame cat, the affinity of the ordinary British cat to _F.\r\nsylvestris_ is manifest; and due I suspect to frequent intermixture at a\r\ntime when the tame cat was first introduced into Britain and continued\r\nrare, while the wild species was far more abundant than at present.\" In\r\nHungary, Jeitteles[90] was assured on trustworthy authority that a wild\r\nmale cat crossed with a female domestic cat, and that the hybrids long\r\nlived in a domesticated state. In Algiers the domestic cat has crossed with\r\nthe wild cat (_F. Lybica_) of that country.[91] In South Africa, as Mr. E.\r\nLayard informs me, the domestic cat intermingles freely with the wild _F.\r\ncaffra_; he has seen a pair of hybrids which were quite tame and\r\nparticularly attached to the lady who brought them up; and Mr. Fry has\r\nfound that these hybrids are fertile. In India the domestic cat, according\r\nto Mr. Blyth, has crossed with four Indian species. With respect to one of\r\nthese species, _F. chaus_, an excellent observer, Sir W. Elliot, informs me\r\nthat he once killed, near Madras, a wild brood, which were evidently\r\nhybrids from the domestic cat; these young animals had a thick lynx-like\r\ntail and the broad brown bar on the inside of the forearm characteristic of\r\n_F. chaus_. Sir W. Elliot adds that he has often observed this same mark on\r\nthe forearms of domestic cats in India. Mr. Blyth states that domestic cats\r\ncoloured nearly like _F. chaus_, but not resembling that species in shape,\r\nabound in {45} Bengal; he adds, \"such a colouration is utterly unknown in\r\nEuropean cats, and the proper tabby markings (pale streaks on a black\r\nground, peculiarly and symmetrically disposed), so common in English cats,\r\nare never seen in those of India.\" Dr. D. Short has assured Mr. Blyth[92]\r\nthat at Hansi hybrids between the common cat and _F. ornata_ (or\r\n_torquata_) occur, \"and that many of the domestic cats of that part of\r\nIndia were undistinguishable from the wild _F. ornata_.\" Azara states, but\r\nonly on the authority of the inhabitants, that in Paraguay the cat has\r\ncrossed with two native species. From these several cases we see that in\r\nEurope, Asia, Africa, and America, the common cat, which lives a freer life\r\nthan most other domesticated animals, has crossed with various wild\r\nspecies; and that in some instances the crossing has been sufficiently\r\nfrequent to affect the character of the breed.\r\n\r\nWhether domestic cats have descended from several distinct species, or have\r\nonly been modified by occasional crosses, their fertility, as far as is\r\nknown, is unimpaired. The large Angora or Persian cat is the most distinct\r\nin structure and habits of all the domestic breeds; and is believed by\r\nPallas, but on no distinct evidence, to be descended from the _F. manul_ of\r\nmiddle Asia; but I am assured by Mr. Blyth that this cat breeds freely with\r\nIndian cats, which, as we have already seen, have apparently been much\r\ncrossed with _F. chaus_. In England half-bred Angora cats are perfectly\r\nfertile with the common cat; I do not know whether the half-breeds are\r\nfertile one with another; but as they are common in some parts of Europe,\r\nany marked degree of sterility could hardly fail to have been noticed.\r\n\r\nWithin the same country we do not meet with distinct races of the cat, as\r\nwe do of dogs and of most other domestic animals; though the cats of the\r\nsame country present a considerable amount of fluctuating variability. The\r\nexplanation obviously is that, from their nocturnal and rambling habits,\r\nindiscriminate crossing cannot without much trouble be prevented. Selection\r\ncannot be brought into play to produce distinct breeds, or to keep those\r\ndistinct which have been imported from foreign lands. On the other hand, in\r\nislands and {46} in countries completely separated from each other, we meet\r\nwith breeds more or less distinct; and these cases are worth giving as\r\nshowing that the scarcity of distinct races in the same country is not\r\ncaused by a deficiency of variability in the animal. The tail-less cats of\r\nthe Isle of Man are said to differ from common cats not only in the want of\r\na tail, but in the greater length of their hind legs, in the size of their\r\nheads, and in habits. The Creole cat of Antigua, as I am informed by Mr.\r\nNicholson, is smaller, and has a more elongated head, than the British cat.\r\nIn Ceylon, as Mr. Thwaites writes to me, every one at first notices the\r\ndifferent appearance of the native cat from the English animal; it is of\r\nsmall size, with closely lying hairs; its head is small, with a receding\r\nforehead; but the ears are large and sharp; altogether it has what is there\r\ncalled a \"low-caste\" appearance. Rengger[93] says that the domestic cat,\r\nwhich has been bred for 300 years in Paraguay, presents a striking\r\ndifference from the European cat; it is smaller by a fourth, has a more\r\nlanky body, its hair is short, shining, scanty, and lies close, especially\r\non the tail: he adds that the change has been less at Ascension, the\r\ncapital of Paraguay, owing to the continual crossing with newly imported\r\ncats; and this fact well illustrates the importance of separation. The\r\nconditions of life in Paraguay appear not to be highly favourable to the\r\ncat, for, though they have run half-wild, they do not become thoroughly\r\nferal, like so many other European animals. In another part of South\r\nAmerica, according to Roulin,[94] the introduced cat has lost the habit of\r\nuttering its hideous nocturnal howl. The Rev. W. D. Fox purchased a cat in\r\nPortsmouth, which he was told came from the coast of Guinea; its skin was\r\nblack and wrinkled, fur bluish-grey and short, its ears rather bare, legs\r\nlong, and whole aspect peculiar. This \"negro\" cat was fertile with common\r\ncats. On the opposite coast of Africa, at Mombas, Captain Owen, R.N.,[95]\r\nstates that all the cats are covered with short stiff hair instead of fur:\r\nhe gives a curious account of a cat from Algoa Bay, which had been kept for\r\nsome time on board and could be identified with certainty; this {47} animal\r\nwas left for only eight weeks at Mombas, but during that short period it\r\n\"underwent a complete metamorphosis, having parted with its sandy-coloured\r\nfur.\" A cat from the Cape of Good Hope has been described by Desmarest as\r\nremarkable from a red stripe extending along the whole length of its back.\r\nThroughout an immense area, namely, the Malayan archipelago, Siam, Pegu,\r\nand Burmah, all the cats have truncated tails about half the proper\r\nlength,[96] often with a sort of knot at the end. In the Caroline\r\narchipelago the cats have very long legs, and are of a reddish-yellow\r\ncolour.[97] In China a breed has drooping ears. At Tobolsk, according to\r\nGmelin, there is a red-coloured breed. In Asia, also, we find the\r\nwell-known Angora or Persian breed.\r\n\r\nThe domestic cat has run wild in several countries, and everywhere assumes,\r\nas far as can be judged by the short recorded descriptions, a uniform\r\ncharacter. Near Maldonado, in La Plata, I shot one which seemed perfectly\r\nwild; it was carefully examined by Mr. Waterhouse,[98] who found nothing\r\nremarkable in it, excepting its great size. In New Zealand, according to\r\nDieffenbach, the feral cats assume a streaky grey colour like that of wild\r\ncats; and this is the case with the half-wild cats of the Scotch Highlands.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that distant countries possess distinct domestic races of the\r\ncat. The differences may be in part due to descent from several aboriginal\r\nspecies, or at least to crosses with them. In some cases, as in Paraguay,\r\nMombas, and Antigua, the differences seem due to the direct action of\r\ndifferent conditions of life. In other cases some slight effect may\r\npossibly be attributed to natural selection, as cats in many cases have\r\nlargely to support themselves and to escape diverse dangers. But man, owing\r\nto the difficulty of pairing cats, has done nothing by methodical\r\nselection; and probably very little by unintentional selection; though in\r\neach litter he generally saves the prettiest, {48} and values most a good\r\nbreed of mouse or rat-catchers. Those cats which have a strong tendency to\r\nprowl after game, generally get destroyed by traps. As cats are so much\r\npetted, a breed bearing the same relation to other cats, that lapdogs bear\r\nto larger dogs, would have been much valued; and if selection could have\r\nbeen applied, we should certainly have had many breeds in each\r\nlong-civilized country, for there is plenty of variability to work upon.\r\n\r\nWe see in this country considerable diversity in size, some in the\r\nproportions of the body, and extreme variability in colouring. I have only\r\nlately attended to this subject, but have already heard of some singular\r\ncases of variation; one of a cat born in the West Indies toothless, and\r\nremaining so all its life. Mr. Tegetmeier has shown me the skull of a\r\nfemale cat with its canines so much developed that they protruded uncovered\r\nbeyond the lips; the tooth with the fang being .95, and the part projecting\r\nfrom the gum .6 of an inch in length. I have heard of a family of six-toed\r\ncats. The tail varies greatly in length; I have seen a cat which always\r\ncarried its tail flat on its back when pleased. The ears vary in shape, and\r\ncertain strains, in England, inherit a pencil-like tuft of hairs, above a\r\nquarter of an inch in length, on the tips of their ears; and this same\r\npeculiarity, according to Mr. Blyth, characterises some cats in India. The\r\ngreat variability in the length of the tail and the lynx-like tufts of\r\nhairs on the ears are apparently analogous to differences in certain wild\r\nspecies of the genus. A much more important difference, according to\r\nDaubenton,[99] is that the intestines of domestic cats are wider, and a\r\nthird longer, than in wild cats of the same size; and this apparently has\r\nbeen caused by their less strictly carnivorous diet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{49}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHORSES AND ASSES.\r\n\r\n    HORSE.--DIFFERENCES IN THE BREEDS--INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY OF--DIRECT\r\n    EFFECTS OF THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE--CAN WITHSTAND MUCH COLD--BREEDS MUCH\r\n    MODIFIED BY SELECTION--COLOURS OF THE HORSE--DAPPLING--DARK STRIPES ON\r\n    THE SPINE, LEGS, SHOULDERS, AND FOREHEAD--DUN-COLOURED HORSES MOST\r\n    FREQUENTLY STRIPED--STRIPES PROBABLY DUE TO REVERSION TO THE PRIMITIVE\r\n    STATE OF THE HORSE.\r\n\r\n    ASSES.--BREEDS OF--COLOUR OF--LEG- AND SHOULDER-\r\n    STRIPES--SHOULDER-STRIPES SOMETIMES ABSENT, SOMETIMES FORKED.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Horse is lost in antiquity. Remains of this animal in a\r\ndomesticated condition have been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings,\r\nbelonging to the latter part of the Stone period.[100] At the present time\r\nthe number of breeds is great, as may be seen by consulting any treatise on\r\nthe Horse.[101] Looking only to the native ponies of Great Britain, those\r\nof the Shetland Isles, Wales, the New Forest, and Devonshire are\r\ndistinguishable; and so it is with each separate island in the great Malay\r\narchipelago.[102] Some of the breeds present great differences in size,\r\nshape of ears, length of mane, proportions of the body, form of the withers\r\nand hind quarters, and especially in the head. Compare the race-horse,\r\ndray-horse, and a Shetland pony in size, configuration, and disposition;\r\nand see how much greater the difference is than between the six or seven\r\nother living species of the genus Equus.\r\n\r\n{50}\r\n\r\nOf individual variations not known to characterise particular breeds, and\r\nnot great or injurious enough to be called monstrosities, I have not\r\ncollected many cases. Mr. G. Brown, of the Cirencester Agricultural\r\nCollege, who has particularly attended to the dentition of our domestic\r\nanimals, writes to me that he has \"several times noticed eight permanent\r\nincisors instead of six in the jaw.\" Male horses alone properly have\r\ncanines, but they are occasionally found in the mare, though of small\r\nsize.[103] The number of ribs is properly eighteen, but Youatt[104] asserts\r\nthat not unfrequently there are nineteen on each side, the additional one\r\nbeing always the posterior rib. I have seen several notices of variations\r\nin the bones of the leg; thus Mr. Price[105] speaks of an additional bone\r\nin the hock, and of certain abnormal appearances between the tibia and\r\nastragalus, as quite common in Irish horses, and not due to disease. Horses\r\nhave often been observed, according to M. Gaudry,[106] to possess a\r\ntrapezium and a rudiment of a fifth metacarpal bone, so that \"one sees\r\nappearing by monstrosity, in the foot of the horse, structures which\r\nnormally exist in the foot of the Hipparion,\"--an allied and extinct\r\nanimal. In various countries horn-like projections have been observed on\r\nthe frontal bones of the horse: in one case described by Mr. Percival they\r\narose about two inches above the orbital processes, and were \"very like\r\nthose in a calf from five to six months old,\" being from half to\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in length.[107] Azara has described two cases in\r\nSouth America in which the projections were between three and four inches\r\nin length: other instances have occurred in Spain.\r\n\r\nThat there has been much inherited variation in the horse cannot be\r\ndoubted, when we reflect on the number of the breeds existing throughout\r\nthe world or even within the same country, and when we know that they have\r\nlargely increased in number {51} since the earliest known records.[108]\r\nEven in so fleeting a character as colour, Hofacker[109] found that, out of\r\ntwo hundred and sixteen cases in which horses of the same colour were\r\npaired, only eleven pairs produced foals of a quite different colour. As\r\nProfessor Low[110] has remarked, the English race-horse offers the best\r\npossible evidence of inheritance. The pedigree of a race-horse is of more\r\nvalue in judging of its probable success than its appearance: \"King Herod\"\r\ngained in prizes 201,505l. sterling, and begot 497 winners; \"Eclipse\" begot\r\n334 winners.\r\n\r\nWhether the whole amount of difference between the various breeds be due to\r\nvariation is doubtful. From the fertility of the most distinct breeds[111]\r\nwhen crossed, naturalists have generally looked at all the breeds as having\r\ndescended from a single species. Few will agree with Colonel H. Smith, who\r\nbelieves that they have descended from no less than five primitive and\r\ndifferently coloured stocks.[112] But as several species and varieties of\r\nthe horse existed[113] during the later tertiary periods, and as Rütimeyer\r\nfound differences in the size and form of the skull in the earliest known\r\ndomesticated horses,[114] we ought not to feel sure that all our breeds\r\nhave descended from a single species. As we see that the savages of North\r\nand South America easily reclaim the feral horses, there is no\r\nimprobability in savages in various quarters of the world having\r\ndomesticated more than one native species or natural race. No aboriginal or\r\ntruly wild horse is positively known now to exist; for it is thought by\r\nsome authors that the wild horses of the East are escaped domestic\r\nanimals.[115] If our domestic breeds have descended from several {52}\r\nspecies or natural races, these apparently have all become extinct in the\r\nwild state. With our present knowledge, the common view that all have\r\ndescended from a single species is, perhaps, the most probable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the causes of the modifications which horses have\r\nundergone, the conditions of life seem to produce a considerable direct\r\neffect. Mr. D. Forbes, who has had excellent opportunities of comparing the\r\nhorses of Spain with those of South America, informs me that the horses of\r\nChile, which have lived under nearly the same conditions as their\r\nprogenitors in Andalusia, remain unaltered, whilst the Pampas horses and\r\nthe Puno ponies are considerably modified. There can be no doubt that\r\nhorses become greatly reduced in size and altered in appearance by living\r\non mountains and islands; and this apparently is due to want of nutritious\r\nor varied food. Every one knows how small and rugged the ponies are on the\r\nNorthern islands and on the mountains of Europe. Corsica and Sardinia have\r\ntheir native ponies; and there were,[116] or still are, on some islands on\r\nthe coast of Virginia, ponies like those of the Shetland Islands, which are\r\nbelieved to have originated through exposure to unfavourable conditions.\r\nThe Puno ponies, which inhabit the lofty regions of the Cordillera, are, as\r\nI hear from Mr. D. Forbes, strange little creatures, very unlike their\r\nSpanish progenitors. Further south, in the Falkland Islands, the offspring\r\nof the horses imported in 1764 have already so much deteriorated in\r\nsize[117] and strength that they are unfitted for catching wild cattle with\r\nthe lasso; so that fresh horses have to be brought for this purpose from La\r\nPlata at a great expense. The reduced size of the horses bred on both\r\nsouthern and northern islands, and on several mountain-chains, can hardly\r\nhave been caused by the cold, as a similar reduction has occurred on the\r\nVirginian and Mediterranean islands. The horse can withstand intense cold,\r\nfor wild troops live on the plains of Siberia under lat. 56°,[118] and\r\naboriginally the horse must {53} have inhabited countries annually covered\r\nwith snow, for he long retains the instinct of scraping it away to get at\r\nthe herbage beneath. The wild tarpans in the East have this instinct; and,\r\nas I am informed by Admiral Sulivan, this is likewise the case with the\r\nhorses which have run wild on the Falkland Islands; now this is the more\r\nremarkable as the progenitors of these horses could not have followed this\r\ninstinct during many generations in La Plata: the wild cattle of the\r\nFalklands never scrape away the snow, and perish when the ground is long\r\ncovered. In the northern parts of America the horses, descended from those\r\nintroduced by the Spanish conquerors of Mexico, have the same habit, as\r\nhave the native bisons, but not so the cattle introduced from Europe.[119]\r\n\r\nThe horse can flourish under intense heat as well as under intense cold,\r\nfor he is known to come to the highest perfection, though not attaining a\r\nlarge size, in Arabia and northern Africa. Much humidity is apparently more\r\ninjurious to the horse than heat or cold. In the Falkland Islands, horses\r\nsuffer much from the dampness; and this same circumstance may perhaps\r\npartly account for the singular fact that to the eastward of the Bay of\r\nBengal,[120] over an enormous and humid area, in Ava, Pegu, Siam, the\r\nMalayan archipelago, the Loo Choo Islands, and a large part of China, no\r\nfull-sized horse is found. When we advance as far eastward as Japan, the\r\nhorse reacquires his full size.[121]\r\n\r\nWith most of our domesticated animals, some breeds are kept on account of\r\ntheir curiosity or beauty; but the horse is valued almost solely for its\r\nutility. Hence semi-monstrous breeds are not preserved; and probably all\r\nthe existing breeds have been slowly formed either by the direct action of\r\nthe conditions of life, or through the selection of individual differences.\r\nNo doubt semi-monstrous breeds might have been formed: thus Mr. Waterton\r\nrecords[122] the case of a mare which produced {54} successively three\r\nfoals without tails; so that a tailless race might have been formed like\r\nthe tailless races of dogs and cats. A Russian breed of horses is said to\r\nhave frizzled hair, and Azara[123] relates that in Paraguay horses are\r\noccasionally born, but are generally destroyed, with hair like that on the\r\nhead of a negro; and this peculiarity is transmitted even to half-breeds:\r\nit is a curious case of correlation that such horses have short manes and\r\ntails, and their hoofs are of a peculiar shape like those of a mule.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to doubt that the long-continued selection of\r\nqualities serviceable to man has been the chief agent in the formation of\r\nthe several breeds of the horse. Look at a dray-horse, and see how well\r\nadapted he is to draw heavy weights, and how unlike in appearance to any\r\nallied wild animal. The English race-horse is known to have proceeded from\r\nthe commingled blood of Arabs, Turks, and Barbs; but selection and training\r\nhave together made him a very different animal from his parent-stocks. As a\r\nwriter in India, who evidently knows the pure Arab well, asks, who now,\r\n\"looking at our present breed of race-horses, could have conceived that\r\nthey were the result of the union of the Arab horse and African mare?\" The\r\nimprovement is so marked that in running for the Goodwood Cup \"the first\r\ndescendants of Arabian, Turkish, and Persian horses, are allowed a discount\r\nof 18 lbs. weight; and when both parents are of these countries a discount\r\nof 36 lbs.\"[124] It is notorious that the Arabs have long been as careful\r\nabout the pedigree of their horses as we are, and this implies great and\r\ncontinued care in breeding. Seeing what has been done in England by careful\r\nbreeding, can we doubt that the Arabs must likewise have produced during\r\nthe course of centuries a marked effect on the qualities of their horses?\r\nBut we may go much farther back in time, for in the most ancient known\r\nbook, the Bible, we hear of studs carefully kept for breeding, {55} and of\r\nhorses imported at high prices from various countries.[125] We may\r\ntherefore conclude that, whether or not the various existing breeds of the\r\nhorse have proceeded from one or more aboriginal stocks, yet that a great\r\namount of change has resulted from the direct action of the conditions of\r\nlife, and probably a still greater amount from the long-continued selection\r\nby man of slight individual differences.\r\n\r\nWith several domesticated quadrupeds and birds, certain coloured marks are\r\neither strongly inherited or tend to reappear after having long been lost.\r\nAs this subject will hereafter be seen to be of importance, I will give a\r\nfull account of the colouring of horses. All English breeds, however unlike\r\nin size and appearance, and several of those in India and the Malay\r\narchipelago, present a similar range and diversity of colour. The English\r\nrace-horse, however, is said[126] never to be dun-coloured; but as dun and\r\ncream-coloured horses are considered by the Arabs as worthless, \"and fit\r\nonly for Jews to ride,\"[127] these tints may have been removed by\r\nlong-continued selection. Horses of every colour, and of such widely\r\ndifferent kinds as dray-horses, cobs, and ponies, are all occasionally\r\ndappled,[128] in the same manner as is so conspicuous with grey horses.\r\nThis fact does not throw any clear light on the colouring of the aboriginal\r\nhorse, but is a case of analogous variation, for even asses are sometimes\r\ndappled, and I have seen, in the British Museum, a hybrid from the ass and\r\nzebra dappled on its hinder quarters. By the expression analogous variation\r\n(and it is one that I shall often have occasion to use) I mean a variation\r\noccurring in a species or variety which resembles a normal character in\r\nanother and distinct species or variety. Analogous variations may arise, as\r\nwill be explained in a future chapter, {56} from two or more forms with a\r\nsimilar constitution having been exposed to similar conditions,--or from\r\none of two forms having reacquired through reversion a character inherited\r\nby the other form from their common progenitor,--or from both forms having\r\nreverted to the same ancestral character. We shall immediately see that\r\nhorses occasionally exhibit a tendency to become striped over a large part\r\nof their bodies; and as we know that stripes readily pass into spots and\r\ncloudy marks in the varieties of the domestic cat and in several feline\r\nspecies--even the cubs of the uniformly-coloured lion being spotted with\r\ndark marks on a lighter ground--we may suspect that the dappling of the\r\nhorse, which has been noticed by some authors with surprise, is a\r\nmodification or vestige of a tendency to become striped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Dun Devonshire Pony, with shoulder, spinal, and leg\r\nstripes.]\r\n\r\n    This tendency in the horse to become striped is in several respects an\r\n    interesting feet. Horses of all colours, of the most diverse breeds, in\r\n    various parts of the world, often have a dark stripe extending along\r\n    the spine, from the mane to the tail; but this is so common that I need\r\n    enter into no particulars.[129] Occasionally horses are transversely\r\n    barred on the legs, chiefly on the under side; and more rarely they\r\n    have a distinct stripe on the shoulder, like that on the shoulder of\r\n    the ass, or a broad dark patch representing a stripe. Before entering\r\n    on any details I must premise that {57} the term dun-coloured is vague,\r\n    and includes three groups of colour, viz. that between cream-colour and\r\n    reddish-brown, which graduates into light-bay or light-chesnut--this, I\r\n    believe, is often called fallow-dun; secondly, leaden or slate-colour\r\n    or mouse-dun, which graduates into an ash-colour; and, lastly,\r\n    dark-dun, between brown and black. In England I have examined a rather\r\n    large, lightly-built, fallow-dun Devonshire pony (fig. 1), with a\r\n    conspicuous stripe along the back, with light transverse stripes on the\r\n    under sides of its front legs, and with four parallel stripes on each\r\n    shoulder. Of these four stripes the posterior one was very minute and\r\n    faint; the anterior one, on the other hand, was long and broad, but\r\n    interrupted in the middle, and truncated at its lower extremity, with\r\n    the anterior angle produced into a long tapering point. I mention this\r\n    latter fact because the shoulder-stripe of the ass occasionally\r\n    presents exactly the same appearance. I have had an outline and\r\n    description sent to me of a small, purely-bred, light fallow-dun Welch\r\n    pony, with a spinal stripe, a single transverse stripe on each leg, and\r\n    three shoulder-stripes; the posterior stripe corresponding with that on\r\n    the shoulder of the ass was the longest, whilst the two anterior\r\n    parallel stripes, arising from the mane, decreased in length, in a\r\n    reversed manner as compared with the shoulder-stripes on the\r\n    above-described Devonshire pony. I have seen a bright fallow-dun,\r\n    strong cob, with its front legs transversely barred on the under sides\r\n    in the most conspicuous manner; also a dark-leaden mouse-coloured pony\r\n    with similar leg stripes, but much less conspicuous; also a bright\r\n    fallow-dun colt, fully three-parts thoroughbred, with very plain\r\n    transverse stripes on the legs; also a chesnut-dun cart-horse with a\r\n    conspicuous spinal stripe, with distinct traces of shoulder-stripes,\r\n    but none on the legs; I could add other cases. My son made a sketch for\r\n    me of a large, heavy, Belgian cart-horse, of a fallow-dun, with a\r\n    conspicuous spinal stripe, traces of leg-stripes, and with two parallel\r\n    (three inches apart) stripes about seven or eight inches in length on\r\n    both shoulders. I have seen another rather light cart-horse, of a dirty\r\n    dark cream-colour, with striped legs, and on one shoulder a large\r\n    ill-defined dark cloudy patch, and on the opposite shoulder two\r\n    parallel faint stripes. All the cases yet mentioned are duns of various\r\n    tints; but Mr. W. W. Edwards has seen a nearly thoroughbred chesnut\r\n    horse which had the spinal stripe, and distinct bars on the legs; and I\r\n    have seen two bay carriage-horses with black spinal stripes; one of\r\n    these horses had on each shoulder a light shoulder-stripe, and the\r\n    other had a broad black ill-defined stripe, running obliquely half-way\r\n    down each shoulder; neither had leg-stripes.\r\n\r\n    The most interesting case which I have met with occurred in a colt of\r\n    my own breeding. A bay mare (descended from a dark-brown Flemish mare\r\n    by a light grey Turcoman horse) was put to Hercules, a thoroughbred\r\n    dark bay, whose sire (Kingston) and dam were both bays. The colt\r\n    ultimately turned out brown; but when only a fortnight old it was a\r\n    dirty bay, shaded with mouse-grey, and in parts with a yellowish tint:\r\n    it had only a trace of the spinal stripe, with a few obscure transverse\r\n    bars on the legs; but almost the whole body was marked with very narrow\r\n    dark stripes, in most parts so obscure as to be visible only in certain\r\n    lights, like the {58} stripes which may be seen on black kittens. These\r\n    stripes were distinct on the hind-quarters, where they diverged from\r\n    the spine, and pointed a little forwards; many of them as they diverged\r\n    from the spine became a little branched, exactly in the same manner as\r\n    in some zebrine species. The stripes were plainest on the forehead\r\n    between the ears, where they formed a set of pointed arches, one under\r\n    the other, decreasing in size downwards towards the muzzle; exactly\r\n    similar marks may be seen on the forehead of the quagga and Burchell's\r\n    zebra. When this foal was two or three months old all the stripes\r\n    entirely disappeared. I have seen similar marks on the forehead of a\r\n    fully grown, fallow-dun, cob-like horse, having a conspicuous spinal\r\n    stripe, and with its front legs well barred.\r\n\r\n    In Norway the colour of the native horse or pony is dun, varying from\r\n    almost cream-colour to dark mouse-dun; and an animal is not considered\r\n    purely bred unless it has the spinal and leg stripes.[130] In one part\r\n    of the country my son estimated that about a third of the ponies had\r\n    striped legs; he counted seven stripes on the fore-legs and two on the\r\n    hind-legs of one pony; only a few of them exhibited traces of\r\n    shoulder-stripes; but I have heard of a cob imported from Norway which\r\n    had the shoulder as well as the other stripes well developed. Colonel\r\n    Ham. Smith[131] alludes to dun-horses with the spinal stripe in the\r\n    Sierras of Spain; and the horses originally derived from Spain, in some\r\n    parts of South America, are now duns. Sir W. Elliot informs me that he\r\n    inspected a herd of 300 South American horses imported into Madras, and\r\n    many of these had transverse stripes on the legs and short\r\n    shoulder-stripes; the most strongly marked individual, of which a\r\n    coloured drawing was sent me, was a mouse-dun, with the\r\n    shoulder-stripes slightly forked.\r\n\r\n    In the North-Western parts of India striped horses of more than one\r\n    breed are apparently commoner than in any other part of the world; and\r\n    I have received information respecting them from several officers,\r\n    especially from Colonel Poole, Colonel Curtis, Major Campbell,\r\n    Brigadier St. John, and others. The Kattywar horses are often fifteen\r\n    or sixteen hands in height, and are well but lightly built. They are of\r\n    all colours, but the several kinds of duns prevail; and these are so\r\n    generally striped, that a horse without stripes is not considered pure.\r\n    Colonel Poole believes that all the duns have the spinal stripe, the\r\n    leg-stripes are generally present, and he thinks that about half the\r\n    horses have the shoulder-stripe; this stripe is sometimes double or\r\n    treble on both shoulders. Colonel Poole has often seen stripes on the\r\n    cheeks and sides of the nose. He has seen stripes on the grey and bay\r\n    Kattywars when first foaled, but they soon faded away. I have received\r\n    other accounts of cream-coloured, bay, brown, and grey Kattywar horses\r\n    being striped. Eastward of India, the Shan (north of Burmah) ponies, as\r\n    I am informed by Mr. Blyth, have spinal, leg, and shoulder stripes. Sir\r\n    W. Elliot informs me that he saw two bay Pegu ponies with {59}\r\n    leg-stripes. Burmese and Javanese ponies are frequently dun-coloured,\r\n    and have the three kinds of stripes, \"in the same degree as in\r\n    England.\"[132] Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he examined two light-dun\r\n    ponies of two Chinese breeds, viz. those of Shangai and Amoy; both had\r\n    the spinal stripe, and the latter an indistinct shoulder-stripe.\r\n\r\n    We thus see that in all parts of the world breeds of the horse as\r\n    different as possible, when of a dun-colour (including under this term\r\n    a wide range of tint from cream to dusky black), and rarely when of\r\n    bay, grey, and chesnut shades, have the several above-specified\r\n    stripes. Horses which are of a yellow colour with white mane and tail,\r\n    and which are sometimes called duns, I have never seen with\r\n    stripes.[133]\r\n\r\n    From reasons which will be apparent in the chapter on Reversion, I have\r\n    endeavoured, but with poor success, to discover whether duns, which are\r\n    so much oftener striped than other coloured horses, are ever produced\r\n    from the crossing of two horses, neither of which are duns. Most\r\n    persons to whom I have applied believe that one parent must be a dun;\r\n    and it is generally asserted, that, when this is the case, the\r\n    dun-colour and the stripes are strongly inherited.[134] One case has\r\n    fallen under my own observation of a foal from a black mare by a bay\r\n    horse, which when fully grown was a dark fallow-dun and had a narrow\r\n    but plain spinal stripe. Hofacker[135] gives two instances of\r\n    mouse-duns (Mausrapp) being produced from two parents of different\r\n    colours and neither duns.\r\n\r\n    I have also endeavoured with little success to find out whether the\r\n    stripes are generally plainer or less plain in the foal than in the\r\n    adult horse. Colonel Poole informs me that, as he believes, \"the\r\n    stripes are plainest when the colt is first foaled; they then become\r\n    less and less distinct till after the first coat is shed, when they\r\n    come out as strongly as before; but certainly often fade away as the\r\n    age of the horse increases.\" Two other accounts confirm this fading of\r\n    the stripes in old horses in India. One writer, on the other hand,\r\n    states that colts are often born without stripes, but that they appear\r\n    as the colt grows older. Three authorities affirm that in Norway the\r\n    stripes are less plain in the foal than in the adult. Perhaps there is\r\n    no fixed rule. In the case described by me of the young foal which was\r\n    narrowly striped over nearly all its body, there was no doubt about the\r\n    the early and complete disappearance of the stripes. Mr. W. W. Edwards\r\n    examined for me twenty-two foals of race-horses, and twelve had the\r\n    spinal stripe more or less plain; this fact, and some other accounts\r\n    which I have received, lead me to believe that the spinal stripe often\r\n    disappears in the English race-horse when old. On the whole I infer\r\n    that the stripes are generally plainest in the foal, and tend to\r\n    disappear in old age.\r\n\r\nThe stripes are variable in colour, but are always darker than the rest of\r\nthe body. They do not by any means always {60} coexist on the different\r\nparts of the body: the legs may be striped without any shoulder-stripe, or\r\nthe converse case, which is rarer, may occur; but I have never heard of\r\neither shoulder or leg-stripes without the spinal stripe. The latter is by\r\nfar the commonest of all the stripes, as might have been expected, as it\r\ncharacterises the other seven or eight species of the genus. It is\r\nremarkable that so trifling a character as the shoulder-stripe being double\r\nor triple should occur in such different breeds as Welch and Devonshire\r\nponies, the Shan pony, heavy cart-horses, light South American horses, and\r\nthe lanky Kattywar breed. Colonel Hamilton Smith believes that one of his\r\nfive supposed primitive stocks was dun-coloured and striped; and that the\r\nstripes in all the other breeds result from ancient crosses with this one\r\nprimitive dun; but it is extremely improbable that different breeds living\r\nin such distant quarters of the world should all have been crossed with any\r\none aboriginally distinct stock. Nor have we any reason to believe that the\r\neffects of a cross at a very remote period could be propagated for so many\r\ngenerations as is implied on this view.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the primitive colour of the horse having been dun, Colonel\r\nHamilton Smith[136] has collected a large body of evidence showing that\r\nthis tint was common in the East as far back as the time of Alexander, and\r\nthat the wild horses of Western Asia and Eastern Europe now are, or\r\nrecently were, of various shades of dun. It seems that not very long ago a\r\nwild breed of dun-coloured horses with a spinal stripe was preserved in the\r\nroyal parks in Prussia. I hear from Hungary that the inhabitants of that\r\ncountry look at the duns with a spinal stripe as the aboriginal stock, and\r\nso it is in Norway. Dun-coloured ponies are not rare in the mountainous\r\nparts of Devonshire, Wales, and Scotland, where the aboriginal breed would\r\nhave had the best chance of being preserved. In South America in the time\r\nof Azara, when the horse had been feral for about 250 years, 90 out of 100\r\nhorses were \"bai-châtains,\" and the remaining ten were \"zains,\" and not\r\nmore than one in 2000 {61} black. Zain is generally translated as dark\r\nwithout any white; but as Azara speaks of mules being \"zain-clair,\" I\r\nsuspect that zain must have meant dun-coloured. In some parts of the world\r\nferal horses show a strong tendency to become roans.[137]\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters on the Pigeon we shall see that in pure breeds of\r\nvarious colours, when a blue bird is occasionally produced, certain black\r\nmarks invariably appear on the wings and tail; so again, when variously\r\ncoloured breeds are crossed, blue birds with the same black marks are\r\nfrequently produced. We shall further see that these facts are explained\r\nby, and afford strong evidence in favour of, the view that all the breeds\r\nare descended from the rock-pigeon, or _Columba livia_, which is thus\r\ncoloured and marked. But the appearance of the stripes on the various\r\nbreeds of the horse, when of a dun-colour, does not afford nearly such good\r\nevidence of their descent from a single primitive stock as in the case of\r\nthe pigeon; because no certainly wild horse is known as a standard of\r\ncomparison; because the stripes when they do appear are variable in\r\ncharacter; because there is far from sufficient evidence of the appearance\r\nof the stripes from the crossing of distinct breeds; and lastly, because\r\nall the species of the genus Equus have the spinal stripe, and several have\r\nshoulder and leg stripes. Nevertheless the similarity in the most distinct\r\nbreeds in their general range of colour, in their dappling, and in the\r\noccasional appearance, especially in duns, of leg-stripes and of double or\r\ntriple shoulder-stripes, taken together, indicate the probability of the\r\ndescent of all the existing races from a single, dun-coloured, more or less\r\nstriped, primitive stock, to which our horses still occasionally revert.\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\nTHE ASS.\r\n\r\nFour species of Asses, besides three of zebras, have been described by\r\nnaturalists; but there can now be little doubt that our domesticated animal\r\nis descended from one alone, namely, the _Asinus tæniopus_ of\r\nAbyssinia.[138] The ass is sometimes advanced as an instance of an animal\r\ndomesticated, as we know by the Old Testament, from an ancient period,\r\nwhich has varied only in a very slight degree. But this is by no means\r\nstrictly true; for in Syria alone there are four breeds;[139] first, a\r\nlight and graceful animal, with an agreeable gait, used by ladies;\r\nsecondly, an Arab breed reserved exclusively for the saddle; thirdly, a\r\nstouter animal used for ploughing and various purposes; and lastly, the\r\nlarge Damascus breed, with a peculiarly long body and ears. In this\r\ncountry, and generally in Central Europe, though the ass is by no means\r\nuniform in appearance, it has not given rise to distinct breeds like those\r\nof the horse. This may probably be accounted for by the animal being kept\r\nchiefly by poor persons, who do not rear large numbers, nor carefully match\r\nand select the young. For, as we shall see in a future chapter, the ass can\r\nwith ease be greatly improved in size and strength by careful selection,\r\ncombined no doubt with good food; and we may infer that all its other\r\ncharacters would be equally amenable to selection. The small size of the\r\nass in England and Northern Europe is apparently due far more to want of\r\ncare in breeding than to cold; for in Western India, where the ass is used\r\nas a beast of burden by some of the lower castes, it is not much larger\r\nthan a Newfoundland dog, \"being generally not more than from twenty to\r\nthirty inches high.\"[140]\r\n\r\nThe ass varies greatly in colour; and its legs, especially the fore-legs,\r\nboth in England and other countries--for instance, in China--are\r\noccasionally barred transversely more plainly than those of dun-coloured\r\nhorses. With the horse the occasional appearance of leg-stripes was\r\naccounted for, through the principle of reversion, by the supposition that\r\nthe primitive horse was {63} thus striped; with the ass we may confidently\r\nadvance this explanation, for the parent-form, the _A. tæniopus_, is known\r\nto be barred, though only in a slight degree, across the legs. The stripes\r\nare believed to occur most frequently and to be plainest on the legs of the\r\ndomestic ass during early youth,[141] as is apparently likewise the case\r\nwith the horse. The shoulder-stripe, which is so eminently characteristic\r\nof the species, is nevertheless variable in breadth, length, and manner of\r\ntermination. I have measured a shoulder-stripe four times as broad as\r\nanother; and some more than twice as long as others. In one light-grey ass\r\nthe shoulder-stripe was only six inches in length, and as thin as a piece\r\nof string; and in another animal of the same colour there was only a dusky\r\nshade representing a stripe. I have heard of three white asses, not\r\nalbinoes, with no trace of shoulder or spinal stripes;[142] and I have seen\r\nnine other asses with no shoulder-stripe, and some of them had no spinal\r\nstripe. Three of the nine were light-greys, one a dark-grey, another grey\r\npassing into reddish-roan, and the others were brown, two being tinted on\r\nparts of their bodies with a reddish or bay shade. Hence we may conclude\r\nthat, if grey and reddish-brown asses had been steadily selected and bred\r\nfrom, the shoulder-stripe would have been almost as generally and as\r\ncompletely lost as in the case of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-stripe on the ass is sometimes double, and Mr. Blyth has seen\r\neven three or four parallel stripes.[143] I have observed in ten cases\r\nshoulder-stripes abruptly truncated at the lower end, with the anterior\r\nangle produced into a tapering point, precisely as has been figured in the\r\ndun Devonshire pony. I have seen three cases of the terminal portion\r\nabruptly and angularly bent; and two cases of a distinct though slight\r\nforking. In Syria, Dr. Hooker and his party observed for me no less than\r\nfive instances of the shoulder-stripe being plainly forked over the fore\r\nleg. In the common mule it is likewise sometimes forked. When I first\r\nnoticed the forking and angular bending of the shoulder-stripe, I had seen\r\nenough of the stripes {64} in the various equine species to feel convinced\r\nthat even a character so unimportant as this had a distinct meaning, and\r\nwas thus led to attend to the subject. I now find that in the _Asinus\r\nBurchellii_ and _quagga_, the stripe which corresponds with the\r\nshoulder-stripe of the ass, as well as some of the stripes on the neck,\r\nbifurcate, and that some of those near the shoulder have their extremities\r\nangularly bent backwards. The forking and angular bending of the stripes on\r\nthe shoulders apparently stand in relation with the changed direction of\r\nthe nearly upright stripes on the sides of the body and neck to the\r\ntransverse bars on the legs. Finally we see that the presence of shoulder,\r\nleg, and spinal stripes in the horse,--their occasional absence in the\r\nass,--the occurrence of double and triple shoulder-stripes in both animals,\r\nand the similar manner in which these stripes terminate at their lower\r\nextremities,--are all cases of analogous variation in the horse and ass.\r\nThese cases are probably not due to similar conditions acting on similar\r\nconstitutions, but to a partial reversion in colour to the common\r\nprogenitor of these two species, as well as of the other species of the\r\ngenus. We shall hereafter have to return to this subject, and discuss it\r\nmore fully.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPIGS--CATTLE--SHEEP--GOATS.\r\n\r\n    PIGS BELONG TO TWO DISTINCT TYPES, SUS SCROFA AND\r\n    INDICA--TORF-SCHWEIN--JAPAN PIG--FERTILITY OF CROSSED PIGS--CHANGES IN\r\n    THE SKULL OF THE HIGHLY CULTIVATED RACES--CONVERGENCE OF\r\n    CHARACTER--GESTATION--SOLID-HOOFED SWINE--CURIOUS APPENDAGES TO THE\r\n    JAWS--DECREASE IN SIZE OF THE TUSKS--YOUNG PIGS LONGITUDINALLY\r\n    STRIPED--FERAL PIGS--CROSSED BREEDS.\r\n\r\n    CATTLE.--ZEBU A DISTINCT SPECIES--EUROPEAN CATTLE PROBABLY DESCENDED\r\n    FROM THREE WILD FORMS--ALL THE RACES NOW FERTILE TOGETHER--BRITISH PARK\r\n    CATTLE--ON THE COLOUR OF THE ABORIGINAL SPECIES--CONSTITUTIONAL\r\n    DIFFERENCES--SOUTH AFRICAN RACES--SOUTH AMERICAN RACES--NIATA\r\n    CATTLE--ORIGIN OF THE VARIOUS RACES OF CATTLE.\r\n\r\n    SHEEP.--REMARKABLE RACES OF--VARIATIONS ATTACHED TO THE MALE\r\n    SEX--ADAPTATIONS TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS--GESTATION OF--CHANGES IN THE\r\n    WOOL--SEMI-MONSTROUS BREEDS.\r\n\r\n    GOATS.--REMARKABLE VARIATIONS OF.\r\n\r\nThe breeds of the pig have recently been more closely studied, though much\r\nstill remains to be done, than those of almost any other domesticated\r\nanimal. This has been effected by Hermann von Nathusius in two admirable\r\nworks, especially in the later one on the Skulls of the several races, and\r\nby Rütimeyer in his celebrated Fauna of the ancient Swiss\r\nlake-dwellings.[144] Nathusius has shown that all the known breeds may be\r\ndivided in two great groups: one resembling in all important respects and\r\nno doubt descended from the common wild boar; so that this may be called\r\nthe _Sus scrofa_ group. The other group differs in several important and\r\nconstant osteological characters; its wild parent-form is unknown; the name\r\ngiven to it by Nathusius, according to the law of priority, is _Sus Indica_\r\nof Pallas. This name must now be followed, though an unfortunate one, as\r\nthe wild aboriginal does not inhabit India, and the best-known domesticated\r\nbreeds have been imported from Siam and China.\r\n\r\n{66}\r\n\r\nFirstly, the _Sus scrofa_ breeds, or those resembling the common wild boar.\r\nThese still exist, according to Nathusius (Schweineschädel, s. 75), in\r\nvarious parts of central and northern Europe; formerly every kingdom,[145]\r\nand almost every province in Britain, possessed its own native breed; but\r\nthese are now everywhere rapidly disappearing, being replaced by improved\r\nbreeds crossed with the _S. Indica_ form. The skull in the breeds of the\r\n_S. scrofa_ type resembles, in all important respects, that of the European\r\nwild boar; but it has become (Schweineschädel, s. 63-68) higher and broader\r\nrelatively to its length; and the hinder part is more upright. The\r\ndifferences, however, are all variable in degree. The breeds which thus\r\nresemble _S. scrofa_ in their essential skull-characters differ\r\nconspicuously from each other in other respects, as in the length of the\r\nears and legs, curvature of the ribs, colour, hairiness, size and\r\nproportions of the body.\r\n\r\nThe wild _Sus scrofa_ has a wide range, namely, Europe, North Africa, as\r\nidentified by osteological characters by Rütimeyer, and Hindostan, as\r\nsimilarly identified by Nathusius. But the wild boars inhabiting these\r\nseveral countries differ so much from each other in external characters,\r\nthat they have been ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct.\r\nEven within Hindostan these animals, according to Mr. Blyth, form very\r\ndistinct races in the different districts; in the N. Western provinces, as\r\nI am informed by the Rev. R. Everest, the boar never exceeds 36 inches in\r\nheight, whilst in Bengal one has been measured 44 inches in height. In\r\nEurope, Northern Africa, and Hindostan, domestic pigs have been known to\r\ncross with the wild native species;[146] and in Hindostan an accurate\r\nobserver,[147] Sir Walter Elliot, after describing the differences between\r\nwild Indian and wild German boars, remarks that \"the same differences are\r\nperceptible in the domesticated {67} individuals of the two countries.\" We\r\nmay therefore conclude that the breeds of the _Sus scrofa_ type have either\r\ndescended from, or been modified by crossing with, forms which may be\r\nranked as geographical races, but which are, according to some naturalists,\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nPigs of the _Sus Indica_ type are best known to Englishmen under the form\r\nof the Chinese breed. The skull of _S. Indica_, as described by Nathusius,\r\ndiffers from that of _S. scrofa_ in several minor respects, as in its\r\ngreater breadth and in some details in the teeth; but chiefly in the\r\nshortness of the lachrymal bones, in the greater width of the fore part of\r\nthe palate-bones, and in the divergence of the premolar teeth. It deserves\r\nespecial notice that these latter characters are not gained, even in the\r\nleast degree, by the domesticated forms of _S. scrofa_. After reading the\r\nremarks and descriptions given by Nathusius, it seems to me to be merely\r\nplaying with words to doubt whether _S. Indica_ ought to be ranked as a\r\nspecies; for the above-specified differences are more strongly marked than\r\nany that can be pointed out between, for instance, the fox and the wolf, or\r\nthe ass and the horse. As already stated, _S. Indica_ is not known in a\r\nwild state; but its domesticated forms, according to Nathusius, come near\r\nto _S. vittatus_ of Java and some allied species. A pig found wild in the\r\nAru islands (Schweineschädel, s. 169) is apparently identical with _S.\r\nIndica_; but it is doubtful whether this is a truly native animal. The\r\ndomesticated breeds of China, Cochin-China, and Siam belong to this type.\r\nThe Roman or Neapolitan breed, the Andalusian, the Hungarian, and the\r\n\"Krause\" swine of Nathusius, inhabiting south-eastern Europe and Turkey,\r\nand having fine curly hair, and the small Swiss \"Bündtnerschwein\" of\r\nRütimeyer, all agree in their more important skull characters with _S.\r\nIndica_, and, as is supposed, have all been largely crossed with this form.\r\nPigs of this type have existed during a long period on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, for a figure (Schweineschädel, s. 142) closely resembling\r\nthe existing Neapolitan pig has been found in the buried city of\r\nHerculaneum.\r\n\r\nRütimeyer has made the remarkable discovery that there lived\r\ncontemporaneously in Switzerland, during the later Stone or Neolithic\r\nperiod, two domesticated forms, the _S. scrofa_, and {68} the _S. scrofa\r\npalustris_ or Torfschwein. Rütimeyer perceived that the latter approached\r\nthe Eastern breeds, and, according to Nathusius, it certainly belongs to\r\nthe _S. Indica_ group; but Rütimeyer has subsequently shown that it differs\r\nin some well-marked characters. This author was formerly convinced that his\r\nTorfschwein existed as a wild animal during the first part of the Stone\r\nperiod, and was domesticated during a later part of the same period.[148]\r\nNathusius, whilst he fully admits the curious fact first observed by\r\nRütimeyer, that the bones of domesticated and wild animals can be\r\ndistinguished by their different aspect, yet, from special difficulties in\r\nthe case of the bones of the pig (Schweineschädel, s. 147), is not\r\nconvinced of the truth of this conclusion; and Rütimeyer himself seems now\r\nto feel some doubt. As the Torfschwein was domesticated at so early a\r\nperiod, and as its remains have been found in several parts of Europe,\r\nbelonging to various historic and prehistoric ages,[149] and as closely\r\nallied forms still exist in Hungary and on the shores of the Mediterranean,\r\none is led to suspect that the wild _S. Indica_ formerly ranged from Europe\r\nto China, in the same manner as _S. scrofa_ now ranges from Europe to\r\nHindostan. Or, as Rütimeyer apparently suspects, a third allied species may\r\nformerly have lived in Europe and Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nSeveral breeds, differing in the proportions of the body, in the length of\r\nthe ears, in the nature of the hair, in colour, &c., come under the _S.\r\nIndica_ type. Nor is this surprising, considering how ancient the\r\ndomestication of this form has been both in Europe and in China. In this\r\nlatter country the date is believed by an eminent Chinese scholar[150] to\r\ngo back at least 4900 years from the present time. This same scholar\r\nalludes to the existence of many local varieties of the pig in China; and\r\nat the present time the Chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and\r\ntending their pigs, not even allowing them to walk from place to\r\nplace.[151] Hence the Chinese breed, as Nathusius has remarked,[152]\r\ndisplays in an eminent degree the characters of a highly-cultivated race,\r\nand hence, no doubt, its {69} high value in the improvement of our European\r\nbreeds. Nathusius makes a remarkable statement (Schweineschädel, s. 138),\r\nthat the infusion of the 1/32nd, or even of the 1/64th, part of the blood\r\nof _S. Indica_ into a breed of _S. scrofa_, is sufficient plainly to modify\r\nthe skull of the latter species. This singular fact may perhaps be\r\naccounted for by several of the chief distinctive characters of _S.\r\nIndica_, such as the shortness of the lachrymal bones, &c., being common to\r\nseveral of the species of the genus; for in crosses the characters which\r\nare common to many species apparently tend to be prepotent over those\r\nappertaining to only a few species.\r\n\r\nThe Japan pig (_S. pliciceps_ of Gray), which has been recently exhibited\r\nin the Zoological Gardens, has an extraordinary appearance from its short\r\nhead, broad forehead and nose, great fleshy ears, and deeply furrowed skin.\r\nThe following woodcut is copied from that given by Mr. Bartlett.[153] Not\r\nonly {70} is the face furrowed, but thick folds of skin, which are harder\r\nthan the other parts, almost like the plates on the Indian rhinoceros, hang\r\nabout the shoulders and rump. It is coloured black, with white feet, and\r\nbreeds true. That it has long been domesticated there can be little doubt;\r\nand this might have been inferred even from the fact that its young are not\r\nlongitudinally striped; for this is a character common to all the species\r\nincluded within the genus _Sus_ and the allied genera whilst in their\r\nnatural state.[154] Dr. Gray[155] has described the skull of this animal,\r\nwhich he ranks not only as a distinct species, but places it in a distinct\r\nsection of the genus. Nathusius, however, after his careful study of the\r\nwhole group, states positively (Schweineschädel, s. 153-158) that the skull\r\nin all essential characters closely resembles that of the short-eared\r\nChinese breed of the _S. Indica_ type. Hence Nathusius considers the Japan\r\npig as only a domesticated variety of _S. Indica_: if this really be the\r\ncase, it is a wonderful instance of the amount of modification which can be\r\neffected under domestication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Head of Japan or Masked Pig. (Copied from Mr.\r\nBartlett's paper in Proc. Zoolog. Soc. 1861, p. 263.)]\r\n\r\nFormerly there existed in the central islands of the Pacific Ocean a\r\nsingular breed of pigs. These are described by the Rev. D. Tyerman and G.\r\nBennett[156] as of small size, hump-backed, with a disproportionately long\r\nhead, with short ears turned backwards, with a bushy tail not more than two\r\ninches in length, placed as if it grew from the back. Within half a century\r\nafter the introduction into these islands of European and Chinese pigs, the\r\nnative breed, according to the above authors, became almost completely lost\r\nby being repeatedly crossed with them. Secluded islands, as might have been\r\nexpected, seem favourable for the production or retention of peculiar\r\nbreeds; thus, in the Orkney Islands, the hogs have been described as very\r\nsmall, with erect and sharp ears, and \"with an appearance altogether\r\ndifferent from the hogs brought from the south.\"[157]\r\n\r\nSeeing how different the Chinese pigs, belonging to the _Sus Indica_ type,\r\nare in their osteological characters and in external {71} appearance from\r\nthe pigs of the _S. scrofa_ type, so that they must be considered\r\nspecifically distinct, it is a fact well deserving attention, that Chinese\r\nand common pigs have been repeatedly crossed in various manners, with\r\nunimpaired fertility. One great breeder who had used pure Chinese pigs\r\nassured me that the fertility of the half-breeds _inter se_ and of their\r\nrecrossed progeny was actually increased; and this is the general belief of\r\nagriculturists. Again, the Japan pig or _S. pliciceps_ of Gray is so\r\ndistinct in appearance from all common pigs, that it stretches one's belief\r\nto the utmost to admit that it is simply a domestic variety; yet this breed\r\nhas been found perfectly fertile with the Berkshire breed; and Mr. Eyton\r\ninforms me that he paired a half-bred brother and sister and found them\r\nquite fertile together.\r\n\r\nThe modifications of the skull in the most highly cultivated races are\r\nwonderful. To appreciate the amount of change, Nathusius' work, with its\r\nexcellent figures, should be studied. The whole of the exterior of the\r\nskull in all its parts has been altered; the hinder surface, instead of\r\nsloping backwards, is directed forwards, entailing many changes in other\r\nparts; the front of the head is deeply concave; the orbits have a different\r\nshape; the auditory meatus has a different direction and shape; the\r\nincisors of the upper and lower jaws do not touch each other, and they\r\nstand in both jaws above the plane of the molars; the canines of the upper\r\njaw stand in front of those of the lower jaw, and this is a remarkable\r\nanomaly: the articular surfaces of the occipital condyles are so greatly\r\nchanged in shape, that, as Nathusius remarks (s. 133), no naturalist,\r\nseeing this important part of the skull by itself, would suppose that it\r\nbelonged to the genus Sus. These and various other modifications, as\r\nNathusius observes, can hardly be considered as monstrosities, for they are\r\nnot injurious, and are strictly inherited. The whole head is much\r\nshortened; thus, whilst in common breeds its length to that of the body is\r\nas 1 to 6, in the \"cultur-races\" the proportion is as 1 to 9, and even\r\nrecently as 1 to 11.[158] The following woodcut[159] {72} of the head of a\r\nwild boar and of a sow from a photograph of the Yorkshire Large Breed, may\r\naid in showing how greatly the head in a highly cultivated race has been\r\nmodified and shortened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Head of Wild Boar, and of \"Golden Days,\" a pig of\r\nthe Yorkshire Large Breed; the latter from a photograph. (Copied from\r\nSidney's edit. of 'The Pig,' by Youatt.)]\r\n\r\nNathusius has well discussed the causes of the remarkable changes in the\r\nskull and shape of the body which the highly cultivated races have\r\nundergone. These modifications occur chiefly in the pure and crossed races\r\nof the _S. Indica_ type; but their commencement may be clearly detected in\r\nthe slightly improved breeds of the _S. scrofa_ type.[160] Nathusius states\r\npositively (s. 99, 103), as the result of common experience and of his\r\nexperiments, that rich and abundant food, given during youth, tends by some\r\ndirect action to make the head broader and shorter; and that poor food\r\nworks a contrary result. He lays much stress on the fact that all wild and\r\nsemi-domesticated pigs, in ploughing up the ground with their muzzles,\r\nhave; whilst young, to exert the powerful muscles fixed to the hinder part\r\nof the head. In highly cultivated races this habit is no longer followed,\r\nand consequently the back of the skull becomes modified in shape, entailing\r\nother changes in other parts. There can hardly be a doubt that so great a\r\nchange in habits would {73} affect the skull; but it seems rather doubtful\r\nhow far this will account for the greatly reduced length of the skull and\r\nfor its concave front. It is well known (Nathusius himself advancing many\r\ncases, s. 104) that there is a strong tendency in many domestic animals--in\r\nbull- and pug-dogs, in the niata cattle, in sheep, in Polish fowls,\r\nshort-faced tumbler pigeons, and in one variety of the carp--for the bones\r\nof the face to become greatly shortened. In the case of the dog, as H.\r\nMüller has shown, this seems caused by an abnormal state of the primordial\r\ncartilage. We may, however, readily admit that abundant and rich food\r\nsupplied during many generations would give an inherited tendency to\r\nincreased size of body, and that, from disuse, the limbs would become finer\r\nand shorter.[161] We shall in a future chapter also see that the skull and\r\nlimbs are apparently in some manner correlated, so that any change in the\r\none tends to affect the other.\r\n\r\nNathusius has remarked, and the observation is an interesting one, that the\r\npeculiar form of the skull and body in the most highly cultivated races is\r\nnot characteristic of any one race, but is common to all when improved up\r\nto the same standard. Thus the large-bodied, long-eared, English breeds\r\nwith a convex back, and the small-bodied, short-eared, Chinese breeds with\r\na concave back, when bred to the same state of perfection, nearly resemble\r\neach other in the form of the head and body. This result, it appears, is\r\npartly due to similar causes of change acting on the several races, and\r\npartly to man breeding the pig for one sole purpose, namely, for the\r\ngreatest amount of flesh and fat; so that selection has always tended\r\ntowards one and the same end. With most domestic animals the result of\r\nselection has been divergence of character, here it has been\r\nconvergence.[162]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the food supplied during many generations has apparently\r\naffected the length of the intestines; for, according to Cuvier,[163] their\r\nlength to that of the body in the wild boar is as 9 to 1,--in the common\r\ndomestic boar as 13.5 to 1,--and in the Siam breed as 16 to 1. In this\r\nlatter breed the greater {74} length may be due either to descent from a\r\ndistinct species or to more ancient domestication. The number of mammæ\r\nvary, as does the period of gestation. The latest authority says[164] that\r\n\"the period averages from 17 to 20 weeks,\" but I think there must be some\r\nerror in this statement: in M. Tessier's observations on 25 sows it varied\r\nfrom 109 to 123 days. The Rev. W. D. Fox has given me ten carefully\r\nrecorded cases with well-bred pigs, in which the period varied from 101 to\r\n116 days. According to Nathusius the period is shortest in the races which\r\ncome early to maturity; but in these latter the course of development does\r\nnot appear to be actually shortened, for the young animal is born, judging\r\nfrom the state of the skull, less fully developed, or in a more embryonic\r\ncondition,[165] than in the case of common swine, which arrive at maturity\r\nat a later age. In the highly cultivated and early matured races, the\r\nteeth, also, are developed earlier.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the number of the vertebræ and ribs in different kinds of\r\npigs, as observed by Mr. Eyton,[166] and as given in the following table,\r\nhas often been quoted. The African sow probably belongs to the _S. scrofa_\r\ntype; and Mr. Eyton informs me that, since the publication of his paper,\r\ncross-bred animals from the African and English races were found by Lord\r\nHill to be perfectly fertile.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------\r\n                  | English|         |         |             | French\r\n                  |  Long- |         |         |             | Domestic\r\n                  | legged | African | Chinese | Wild Boar,  | Boar, from\r\n                  |  Male. | Female. | Male.   | from Cuvier.| Cuvier.\r\n  ----------------+--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------\r\n  Dorsal          |        |         |         |             |\r\n  vertebræ        |  15    |    13   |   15    |     14      |    14\r\n                  |        |         |         |             |\r\n  Lumbar          |   6    |     6   |    4    |      5      |     5\r\n                  +--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------\r\n  Dorsal and      |        |         |         |             |\r\n  lumbar together |  21    |    19   |   19    |     19      |    19\r\n                  |        |         |         |             |\r\n  Sacral          |   5    |     5   |    4    |      4      |     4\r\n                  +--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------\r\n  Total number    |        |         |         |             |\r\n  of vertebræ     |  26    |    24   |   23    |     23      |    23\r\n  ----------------+--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\nSome semi-monstrous breeds deserve notice. From the time of Aristotle to\r\nthe present time solid-hoofed swine have occasionally been observed in\r\nvarious parts of the world. Although this peculiarity is strongly\r\ninherited, it is hardly probable that all the animals with solid hoofs have\r\ndescended from the same parents; it is more probable that the same\r\npeculiarity has reappeared at various times and places. Dr. Struthers has\r\nlately described and figured[167] the structure of the feet; in both front\r\nand hind feet the distal phalanges of the two greater toes are represented\r\nby a single, great, hoof-bearing phalanx; and in the front feet, the middle\r\nphalanges are represented by a bone which is single towards the lower end,\r\nbut bears two separate articulations towards the upper end. From other\r\naccounts it appears that an intermediate toe is likewise sometimes\r\nsuperadded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Old Irish Pig, with jaw-appendages. (Copied from H.\r\nD. Richardson on Pigs.)]\r\n\r\nAnother curious anomaly is offered by the appendages, described by M.\r\nEudes-Deslongchamps as often characterizing the Normandy pigs. These\r\nappendages are always attached to the same spot, to the corners of the jaw;\r\nthey are cylindrical, about three inches in length, covered with bristles,\r\nand with a pencil of bristles rising out of a sinus on one side: they have\r\na cartilaginous centre, with two small longitudinal muscles; they occur\r\neither symmetrically on both sides of the face or on one {76} side alone.\r\nRichardson figures them on the gaunt old \"Irish Greyhound pig;\" and\r\nNathusius states that they occasionally appear in all the long-eared races,\r\nbut are not strictly inherited, for they occur or fail in animals of the\r\nsame litter.[168] As no wild pigs are known to have analogous appendages,\r\nwe have at present no reason to suppose that their appearance is due to\r\nreversion; and if this be so, we are forced to admit that somewhat complex,\r\nthough apparently useless, structures may be suddenly developed without the\r\naid of selection. This case perhaps throws some little light on the manner\r\nof appearance of the hideous fleshy protuberances, though of an essentially\r\ndifferent nature from the above-described appendages, on the cheeks of the\r\nwart-hog or Phacochoerus Africanus.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the boars of all domesticated breeds have much\r\nshorter tusks than wild boars. Many facts show that with all animals the\r\nstate of the hair is much affected by exposure to, or protection from,\r\nclimate; and as we see that the state of the hair and teeth are correlated\r\nin Turkish dogs (other analogous facts will be hereafter given), may we not\r\nventure to surmise that the reduction of the tusks in the domestic boar is\r\nrelated to his coat of bristles being diminished from living under shelter?\r\nOn the other hand, as we shall immediately see, the tusks and bristles\r\nreappear with feral boars, which are no longer protected from the weather.\r\nIt is not surprising that the tusks should be more affected than the other\r\nteeth; as parts developed to serve as secondary sexual characters are\r\nalways liable to much variation.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the young of wild European and Indian\r\npigs,[169] for the first six months, are longitudinally banded with\r\nlight-coloured stripes. This character generally disappears under\r\ndomestication. The Turkish domestic pigs, however, have striped young, as\r\nhave those of Westphalia, \"whatever may be their hue;\"[170] whether these\r\nlatter pigs belong to the {77} same curly-haired race with the Turkish\r\nswine, I do not know. The pigs which have run wild in Jamaica and the\r\nsemi-feral pigs of New Granada, both those which are black and those which\r\nare black with a white band across the stomach, often extending over the\r\nback, have resumed this aboriginal character and produce\r\nlongitudinally-striped young. This is likewise the case, at least\r\noccasionally, with the neglected pigs in the Zambesi settlement on the\r\ncoast of Africa.[171]\r\n\r\nThe common belief that all domesticated animals, when they run wild, revert\r\ncompletely to the character of their parent-stock, is chiefly founded, as\r\nfar as I can discover, on feral pigs. But even in this case the belief is\r\nnot grounded on sufficient evidence; for the two main types of _S. scrofa_\r\nand _Indica_ have never been distinguished in a feral state. The young, as\r\nwe have just seen, reacquire their longitudinal stripes, and the boars\r\ninvariably reassume their tusks. They revert also in the general shape of\r\ntheir bodies, and in the length of their legs and muzzles, to the state of\r\nthe wild animal, as might have been expected from the amount of exercise\r\nwhich they are compelled to take in search of food. In Jamaica the feral\r\npigs do not acquire the full size of the European wild boar, \"never\r\nattaining a greater height than 20 inches at the shoulder.\" In various\r\ncountries they reassume their original bristly covering, but in different\r\n{78} degrees, dependent on the climate; thus, according to Roulin, the\r\nsemi-feral pigs in the hot valleys of New Granada are very scantily\r\nclothed; whereas, on the Paramos, at the height of 7000 to 8000 feet, they\r\nacquire a thick covering of wool lying under the bristles, like that on the\r\ntruly wild pigs of France. These pigs on the Paramos are small and stunted.\r\nThe wild boar of India is said to have the bristles at the end of its tail\r\narranged like the plumes of an arrow, whilst the European boar has a simple\r\ntuft; and it is a curious fact that many, but not all, of the feral pigs in\r\nJamaica, derived from a Spanish stock, have a plumed tail.[172] With\r\nrespect to colour, feral pigs generally revert to that of the wild boar;\r\nbut in certain parts of S. America, as we have seen, some of the semi-feral\r\npigs have a curious white band across their stomachs; and in certain other\r\nhot places the pigs are red, and this colour has likewise occasionally been\r\nobserved in the feral pigs of Jamaica. From these several facts we see that\r\nwith pigs when feral there is a strong tendency to revert to the wild type;\r\nbut that this tendency is largely governed by the nature of the climate,\r\namount of exercise, and other causes of change to which they have been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\nThe last point worth notice is that we have unusually good evidence of\r\nbreeds of pigs now keeping perfectly true, which have been formed by the\r\ncrossing of several distinct breeds. The Improved Essex pigs, for instance,\r\nbreed very true; but there is no doubt that they largely owe their present\r\nexcellent qualities to crosses originally made by Lord Western with the\r\nNeapolitan race, and to subsequent crosses with the Berkshire breed (this\r\nalso having been improved by Neapolitan crosses), and likewise, probably,\r\nwith the Sussex breed.[173] In breeds thus formed by complex crosses, the\r\nmost careful and unremitting selection during many generations has been\r\nfound to be indispensable. Chiefly in consequence of so much crossing, some\r\nwell-known breeds have undergone rapid changes; thus, according to\r\nNathusius,[174] the Berkshire breed of 1780 is quite {79} different from\r\nthat of 1810; and, since this latter period, at least two distinct forms\r\nhave borne the same name.\r\n\r\nCATTLE.\r\n\r\nDomestic cattle are almost certainly the descendants of more than one wild\r\nform, in the same manner as has been shown to be the case with our dogs and\r\npigs. Naturalists have generally made two main divisions of cattle: the\r\nhumped kinds inhabiting tropical countries, called in India Zebus, to which\r\nthe specific name of _Bos Indicus_ has been given; and the common\r\nnon-humped cattle, generally included under the name of _Bos taurus._ The\r\nhumped cattle were domesticated, as may be seen on the Egyptian monuments,\r\nat least as early as the twelfth dynasty, that is 2100 B.C. They differ\r\nfrom common cattle in various osteological characters, even in a greater\r\ndegree, according to Rütimeyer,[175] than do the fossil species of Europe,\r\nnamely _Bos primigenius, longifrons_, and _frontosus_, from each other.\r\nThey differ, also, as Mr. Blyth,[176] who has particularly attended to this\r\nsubject, remarks, in general configuration, in the shape of their ears, in\r\nthe point where the dewlap commences, in the typical curvature of their\r\nhorns, in their manner of carrying their heads when at rest, in their\r\nordinary variations of colour, especially in the frequent presence of\r\n\"nilgau-like markings on their feet,\" and \"in the one being born with teeth\r\nprotruding through the jaws, and the other not so.\" They have different\r\nhabits, and their voice is entirely different. The humped cattle in India\r\n\"seldom seek shade, and never go into the water and there stand knee-deep,\r\nlike the cattle of Europe.\" They have run wild in parts of Oude and\r\nRohilcund, and can maintain themselves in a region infested by tigers. They\r\nhave given rise to many races differing greatly in size, in the presence\r\n{80} of one or two humps, in length of horns, and other respects. Mr. Blyth\r\nsums up emphatically that the humped and humpless cattle must be considered\r\nas distinct species. When we consider the number of points in external\r\nstructure and habits, independently of their important osteological\r\ndifferences, in which they differ from each other; and that many of these\r\npoints are not likely to have been affected by domestication, there can\r\nhardly be a doubt, notwithstanding the adverse opinion of some naturalists,\r\nthat the humped and non-humped cattle must be ranked as specifically\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nThe European breeds of humpless cattle are numerous. Professor Low\r\nenumerates 19 British breeds, only a few of which are identical with those\r\non the Continent. Even the small Channel islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and\r\nAlderney, possess their own sub-breeds;[177] and these again differ from\r\nthe cattle of the other British islands, such as Anglesea, and the western\r\nisles of Scotland. Desmarest, who paid attention to the subject, describes\r\n15 French races, excluding sub-varieties and those imported from other\r\ncountries. In other parts of Europe there are several distinct races, such\r\nas the pale-coloured Hungarian cattle, with their light and free step, and\r\ntheir enormous horns sometimes measuring above five feet from tip to\r\ntip:[178] the Podolian cattle are remarkable from the height of their\r\nfore-quarters. In the most recent work on Cattle,[179] engravings are given\r\nof fifty-five European breeds; it is, however, probable that several of\r\nthese differ very little from each other, or are merely synonyms. It must\r\nnot be supposed that numerous breeds of cattle exist only in long-civilized\r\ncountries, for we shall presently see that several kinds are kept by the\r\nsavages of Southern Africa.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the parentage of the several European breeds, we\r\n    already know much from Nilsson's Memoir,[180] and more especially from\r\n    Rütimeyer's 'Pfahlbauten' and succeeding works. Two or three species or\r\n    forms of {81} Bos, closely allied to still living domestic races, have\r\n    been found fossil in the more recent tertiary deposits of Europe.\r\n    Following Rütimeyer, we have:--\r\n\r\n    _Bos primigenius._--This magnificent, well-known species was\r\n    domesticated in Switzerland during the Neolithic period; even at this\r\n    early period it varied a little, having apparently been crossed with\r\n    other races. Some of the larger races on the Continent, as the\r\n    Friesland, &c., and the Pembroke race in England, closely resemble in\r\n    essential structure _B. primigenius_, and no doubt are its descendants.\r\n    This is likewise the opinion of Nilsson. _Bos primigenius_ existed as a\r\n    wild animal in Cæsar's time, and is now semi-wild, though much\r\n    degenerated in size, in the park of Chillingham; for I am informed by\r\n    Professor Rütimeyer, to whom Lord Tankerville sent a skull, that the\r\n    Chillingham cattle are less altered from the true primigenius type than\r\n    any other known breed.[181]\r\n\r\n    _Bos trochoceros._--This form is not included in the three species\r\n    above mentioned, for it is now considered by Rütimeyer to be the female\r\n    of an early domesticated form of _B. primigenius_, and as the\r\n    progenitor of his _frontosus_ race. I may add that specific names have\r\n    been given to four other fossil oxen, now believed to be identical with\r\n    _B. primigenius_.[182]\r\n\r\n    _Bos longifrons_ (or _brachyceros_) of Owen.--This very distinct\r\n    species was of small size, and had a short body with fine legs. It has\r\n    been found in England associated with the remains of the elephant and\r\n    rhinoceros.[183] It was the commonest form in a domesticated condition\r\n    in Switzerland during the earliest part of the Neolithic period. It was\r\n    domesticated in England during the Roman period, and supplied food to\r\n    the Roman legionaries.[184] Some remains have been found in Ireland in\r\n    certain crannoges, of which the dates are believed to be from 843-933\r\n    A.D.[185] Professor Owen[186] thinks it probable that the Welsh and\r\n    Highland cattle are descended from this form; as likewise is the case,\r\n    according to Rütimeyer, with some of the existing Swiss breeds. These\r\n    latter are of different shades of colour from light-grey to\r\n    blackish-brown, with a lighter stripe along the spine, but they have no\r\n    pure white marks. The cattle of North Wales and the Highlands, on the\r\n    other hand, are generally black or dark-coloured.\r\n\r\n    _Bos frontosus_ of Nilsson.--This species is allied to _B. longifrons_,\r\n    but in the opinion of some good judges is distinct from it. Both\r\n    co-existed in Scania during the same late geological period,[187] and\r\n    both have been found in the Irish crannoges.[188] Nilsson believes that\r\n    his _B. frontosus_ may be the {82} parent of the mountain cattle of\r\n    Norway, which have a high protuberance on the skull between the base of\r\n    the horns. As Professor Owen believes that the Scotch Highland cattle\r\n    are descended from his _B. longifrons_, it is worth notice that a\r\n    capable judge[189] has remarked that he saw no cattle in Norway like\r\n    the Highland breed, but that they more nearly resembled the Devonshire\r\n    breed.\r\n\r\nHence we see that three forms or species of Bos, originally inhabitants of\r\nEurope, have been domesticated; but there is no improbability in this fact,\r\nfor the genus Bos readily yields to domestication. Besides these three\r\nspecies and the zebu, the yak, the gayal, and the arni[190] (not to mention\r\nthe buffalo or genus Bubalus) have been domesticated; making altogether\r\nseven species of Bos. The zebu and the three European species are now\r\nextinct in a wild state, for the cattle of the _B. primigenius_ type in the\r\nBritish parks can hardly be considered as truly wild. Although certain\r\nraces of cattle, domesticated at a very ancient period in Europe, are the\r\ndescendants of the three above-named fossil species, yet it does not follow\r\nthat they were here first domesticated. Those who place much reliance on\r\nphilology argue that our cattle were imported from the East.[191] But as\r\nraces of men invading any country would probably give their own names to\r\nthe breeds of cattle which they might there find domesticated, the argument\r\nseems inconclusive. There is indirect evidence that our cattle are the\r\ndescendants of species which originally inhabited a temperate or cold\r\nclimate, but not a land long covered with snow; for our cattle, as we have\r\nseen in the chapter on Horses, apparently have not the instinct of scraping\r\naway the snow to get at the herbage beneath. No one could behold the\r\nmagnificent wild bulls on the bleak Falkland Islands in the southern\r\nhemisphere, and doubt about the climate being admirably suited to them.\r\nAzara has remarked that in the temperate regions of La Plata the cows\r\nconceive when two years old, whilst in the much hotter country of Paraguay\r\nthey do not conceive till three years old; \"from which fact,\" as he adds,\r\n\"one may conclude that cattle do not succeed so well in warm\r\ncountries.\"[192]\r\n\r\nThe above-named three fossil forms of Bos have been ranked {83} by nearly\r\nall palæontologists as distinct species; and it would not be reasonable to\r\nchange their denomination simply because they are now found to be the\r\nparents of several domesticated races. But what is of most importance for\r\nus, as showing that they deserve to be ranked as species, is that they\r\nco-existed in different parts of Europe during the same period, and yet\r\nkept distinct. Their domesticated descendants, on the other hand, if not\r\nseparated, cross with the utmost freedom and become commingled. The several\r\nEuropean breeds have so often been crossed, both intentionally and\r\nunintentionally, that, if any sterility ensued from such unions, it would\r\ncertainly have been detected. As zebus inhabit a distant and much hotter\r\nregion, and as they differ in so many characters from our European cattle,\r\nI have taken pains to ascertain whether the two forms are fertile when\r\ncrossed. The late Lord Powis imported some zebus and crossed them with\r\ncommon cattle in Shropshire; and I was assured by his steward that the\r\ncross-bred animals were perfectly fertile with both parent-stocks. Mr.\r\nBlyth informs me that in India hybrids, with various proportions of either\r\nblood, are quite fertile; and this can hardly fail to be known, for in some\r\ndistricts[193] the two species are allowed to breed freely together. Most\r\nof the cattle which were first introduced into Tasmania were humped, so\r\nthat at one time thousands of crossed animals existed there; and Mr. B.\r\nO'Neile Wilson, M.A., writes to me from Tasmania that he has never heard of\r\nany sterility having been observed. He himself formerly possessed a herd of\r\nsuch crossed cattle, and all were perfectly fertile; so much so, that he\r\ncannot remember even a single cow failing to calve. These several facts\r\nafford an important confirmation of the Pallasian doctrine that the\r\ndescendants of species which when first domesticated would if crossed\r\nprobably have been in some degree sterile, become perfectly fertile after a\r\nlong course of domestication. In a future chapter we shall see that this\r\ndoctrine throws much light on the difficult subject of Hybridism.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the cattle in Chillingham Park, which, according to\r\nRütimeyer, have been very little changed from the _Bos primigenius_ type.\r\nThis park is so ancient that it is {84} referred to in a record of the year\r\n1220. The cattle in their instincts and habits are truly wild. They are\r\nwhite, with the inside of the ears reddish-brown, eyes rimmed with black,\r\nmuzzles brown, hoofs black, and horns white tipped with black. Within a\r\nperiod of thirty-three years about a dozen calves were born with \"brown and\r\nblue spots upon the cheeks or necks; but these, together with any defective\r\nanimals, were always destroyed.\" According to Bewick, about the year 1770\r\nsome calves appeared with black ears; but these were also destroyed by the\r\nkeeper, and black ears have not since reappeared. The wild white cattle in\r\nthe Duke of Hamilton's park, where I have heard of the birth of a black\r\ncalf, are said by Lord Tankerville to be inferior to those at Chillingham.\r\nThe cattle kept until the year 1780 by the Duke of Queensberry, but now\r\nextinct, had their ears, muzzle, and orbits of the eyes black. Those which\r\nhave existed from time immemorial at Chartley; closely resemble the cattle\r\nat Chillingham, but are larger, \"with some small difference in the colour\r\nof the ears.\" \"They frequently tend to become entirely black; and a\r\nsingular superstition prevails in the vicinity that, when a black calf is\r\nborn, some calamity impends over the noble house of Ferrers. All the black\r\ncalves are destroyed.\" The cattle at Burton Constable in Yorkshire, now\r\nextinct, had ears, muzzle, and the tip of the tail black. Those at\r\nGisburne, also in Yorkshire, are said by Bewick to have been sometimes\r\nwithout dark muzzles, with the inside alone of the ears brown; and they are\r\nelsewhere said to have been low in stature and hornless.[194]\r\n\r\nThe several above-specified differences in the park-cattle, slight though\r\nthey be, are worth recording, as they show that animals living nearly in a\r\nstate of nature, and exposed to nearly uniform conditions, if not allowed\r\nto roam freely and to cross with other herds, do not keep as uniform as\r\ntruly {85} wild animals. For the preservation of a uniform character, even\r\nwithin the same park, a certain degree of selection--that is, the\r\ndestruction of the dark-coloured calves--is apparently necessary.\r\n\r\nThe cattle in all the parks are white; but, from the occasional appearance\r\nof dark-coloured calves, it is extremely doubtful whether the aboriginal\r\n_Bos primigenius_ was white. The following facts, however, show that there\r\nis a strong, though not invariable, tendency in wild or escaped cattle,\r\nunder widely different conditions of life, to become white with coloured\r\nears. If the old writers Boethius and Leslie[195] can be trusted, the wild\r\ncattle of Scotland were white and furnished with a great mane; but the\r\ncolour of their ears is not mentioned. The primæval forest formerly\r\nextended across the whole country from Chillingham to Hamilton, and Sir\r\nWalter Scott used to maintain that the cattle still preserved in these two\r\nparks, at the two extremities of the forest, were remnants of its original\r\ninhabitants; and this view certainly seems probable. In Wales,[196] during\r\nthe tenth century, some of the cattle are described as being white with red\r\nears. Four hundred cattle thus coloured were sent to King John; and an\r\nearly record speaks of a hundred cattle with red ears having been demanded\r\nas a compensation for some offence, but, if the cattle were of a dark or\r\nblack colour, one hundred and fifty were to be presented. The black cattle\r\nof North Wales apparently belong, as we have seen, to the small\r\n_longifrons_ type: and as the alternative was offered of either 150 dark\r\ncattle, or 100 white cattle with red ears, we may presume that the latter\r\nwere the larger beasts, and probably belonged to the _primigenius_ type.\r\nYouatt has remarked that at the present day, whenever cattle of the\r\nshort-horn breed are white, the extremities of their ears are more or less\r\ntinged with red.\r\n\r\nThe cattle which have run wild on the Pampas, in Texas, and in two parts of\r\nAfrica, have become of a nearly uniform dark {86} brownish-red.[197] On the\r\nLadrone Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, immense herds of cattle, which were\r\nwild in the year 1741, are described as \"milk-white, except their ears,\r\nwhich are generally black.\"[198] The Falkland Islands, situated far south,\r\nwith all the conditions of life as different as it is possible to conceive\r\nfrom those of the Ladrones, offer a more interesting case. Cattle have run\r\nwild there during eighty or ninety years; and in the southern districts the\r\nanimals are mostly white, with their feet, or whole heads, or only their\r\nears black; but my informant, Admiral Sulivan,[199] who long resided on\r\nthese islands, does not believe that they are ever purely white. So that in\r\nthese two archipelagos we see that the cattle tend to become white with\r\ncoloured ears. In other parts of the Falkland Islands, other colours\r\nprevail: near Port Pleasant brown is the common tint; round Mount Usborne,\r\nabout half the animals in some of the herds were lead or mouse-coloured,\r\nwhich elsewhere is an unusual tint. These latter cattle, though generally\r\ninhabiting high land, breed about a month earlier than the other cattle;\r\nand this circumstance would aid in keeping them distinct and in\r\nperpetuating this peculiar colour. It is worth recalling to mind that blue\r\nor lead-coloured marks have occasionally appeared on the white cattle of\r\nChillingham. So plainly different were the colours of the wild herds in\r\ndifferent parts of the Falkland Islands, that in hunting them, as Admiral\r\nSulivan informs me, white spots in one district, and dark spots in another\r\ndistrict, were always looked out for on the distant hills. In the\r\nintermediate districts intermediate colours prevailed. Whatever the cause\r\nmay be, this tendency in the wild cattle of the Falkland Islands, which are\r\nall descended from a few brought from La Plata, to break up into herds of\r\nthree different colours, is an interesting fact.\r\n\r\nReturning to the several British breeds, the conspicuous difference in\r\ngeneral appearance between Short-horns, Long-horns (now rarely seen),\r\nHerefords, Highland cattle, Alderneys, &c., must be familiar to every one.\r\nA large part of the {87} difference, no doubt, may be due to descent from\r\nprimordially distinct species; but we may feel sure that there has been in\r\naddition a considerable amount of variation. Even during the Neolithic\r\nperiod, the domestic cattle were not actually identical with the aboriginal\r\nspecies. Within recent times most of the breeds have been modified by\r\ncareful and methodical selection. How strongly the characters thus acquired\r\nare inherited, may be inferred from the prices realised by the improved\r\nbreeds; even at the first sale of Colling's Short-horns, eleven bulls\r\nreached an average of 214l., and lately Short-horn bulls have been sold for\r\na thousand guineas, and have been exported to all quarters of the world.\r\n\r\nSome constitutional differences may be here noticed. The Short-horns arrive\r\nat maturity far earlier than the wilder breeds, such as those of Wales or\r\nthe Highlands. This fact has been shown in an interesting manner by Mr.\r\nSimonds,[200] who has given a table of the average period of their\r\ndentition, which proves that there is a difference of no less than six\r\nmonths in the appearance of the permanent incisors. The period of\r\ngestation, from observations made by Tessier on 1131 cows, varies to the\r\nextent of eighty-one days; and what is more interesting, M. Lefour affirms\r\n\"that the period of gestation is longer in the large German cattle than in\r\nthe smaller breeds.\"[201] With respect to the period of conception, it\r\nseems certain that Alderney and Zetland cows often become pregnant earlier\r\nthan other breeds.[202] Lastly, as four fully-developed mammæ is a generic\r\ncharacter in the genus Bos,[203] it is worth notice that with our domestic\r\ncows the two rudimentary mammæ often become fairly well developed and yield\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nAs numerous breeds are generally found only in long-civilized countries, it\r\nmay be well to show that in some countries inhabited by barbarous races,\r\nwho are frequently at war with each other and therefore have little free\r\n{88} communication, several distinct breeds of cattle now exist or formerly\r\nexisted. At the Cape of Good Hope Leguat observed, in the year 1720, three\r\nkinds.[204] At the present day various travellers have noticed the\r\ndifferences in the breeds in Southern Africa. Sir Andrew Smith several\r\nyears ago remarked to me that the cattle possessed by the different tribes\r\nof Caffres, though living near each other under the same latitude and in\r\nthe same kind of country, yet differed, and he expressed much surprise at\r\nthe fact. Mr. Andersson has described[205] the Damara, Bechuana, and\r\nNamaqua cattle; and he informs me in a letter that the cattle north of Lake\r\nNgami are likewise different, as Mr. Galton has heard is the case with the\r\ncattle of Benguela. The Namaqua cattle in size and shape nearly resemble\r\nEuropean cattle, and have short stout horns and large hoofs. The Damara\r\ncattle are very peculiar, being big-boned, with slender legs and small hard\r\nfeet; their tails are adorned with a tuft of long bushy hair nearly\r\ntouching the ground, and their horns are extraordinarily large. The\r\nBechuana cattle have even larger horns, and there is now a skull in London\r\nwith the two horns 8 ft. 8¼ in. long, as measured in a straight line from\r\ntip to tip, and no less than 13ft. 5in. as measured along their curvature!\r\nMr. Andersson in his letter to me says that, though he will not venture to\r\ndescribe the differences between the breeds belonging to the many different\r\nsub-tribes, yet such certainly exist, as shown by the wonderful facility\r\nwith which the natives discriminate them.\r\n\r\nThat many breeds of cattle have originated through variation, independently\r\nof descent from distinct species, we may infer from what we see in South\r\nAmerica, where the genus Bos was not endemic, and where the cattle which\r\nnow exist in such vast numbers are the descendants of a few imported from\r\nSpain and Portugal. In Columbia, Roulin[206] describes two peculiar breeds,\r\nnamely, _pelones_, with extremely thin and fine hair, and _calongos_,\r\nabsolutely naked. According to Castelnau there are two races in Brazil, one\r\nlike European cattle, the other different, with {89} remarkable horns. In\r\nParaguay, Azara describes a breed which certainly originated in S. America,\r\ncalled _chivos_, \"because they have straight vertical horns, conical, and\r\nvery large at the base.\" He likewise describes a dwarf race in Corrientes,\r\nwith short legs and a body larger than usual. Cattle without horns, and\r\nothers with reversed hair, have also originated in Paraguay.\r\n\r\nAnother monstrous breed, called niatas or natas, of which I saw two small\r\nherds on the northern bank of the Plata, is so remarkable as to deserve a\r\nfuller description. This breed bears the same relation to other breeds, as\r\nbull or pug dogs do to other dogs, or as improved pigs, according to H. von\r\nNathusius, do to common pigs.[207] Rütimeyer believes that these cattle\r\nbelong to the primigenius type.[208] The forehead is very short and broad,\r\nwith the nasal end of the skull, together with the whole plane of the upper\r\nmolar-teeth, curved upwards. The lower jaw projects beyond the upper, and\r\nhas a corresponding upward curvature. It is an interesting fact that an\r\nalmost similar conformation characterizes, as I have been informed by Dr.\r\nFalconer, the extinct and gigantic Sivatherium of India, and is not known\r\nin any other ruminant. The upper lip is much drawn back, the nostrils are\r\nseated high up and are widely open, the eyes project outwards, and the\r\nhorns are large. In walking the head is carried low, and the neck is short.\r\nThe hind legs appear to be longer, compared with the front legs, than is\r\nusual. The exposed incisor teeth, the short head and upturned nostrils,\r\ngive these cattle the most ludicrous, self-confident air of defiance. The\r\nskull which I presented to the College of Surgeons has been thus described\r\nby Professor Owen:[209] \"It is remarkable from the stunted development of\r\nthe nasals, premaxillaries, and fore-part of the lower jaw, which is\r\nunusually {90} curved upwards to come into contact with the premaxillaries.\r\nThe nasal bones are about one-third the ordinary length, but retain almost\r\ntheir normal breadth. The triangular vacuity is left between them, the\r\nfrontal and lachrymal, which latter bone articulates with the premaxillary,\r\nand thus excludes the maxillary from any junction with the nasal.\" So that\r\neven the connexion of some of the bones is changed. Other differences might\r\nbe added: thus the plane of the condyles is somewhat modified, and the\r\nterminal edge of the premaxillaries forms an arch. In fact, on comparison\r\nwith the skull of a common ox, scarcely a single bone presents the same\r\nexact shape, and the whole skull has a wonderfully different appearance.\r\n\r\nThe first brief published notice of this race was by Azara, between the\r\nyears 1783-96; but Don F. Muniz, of Luxan, who has kindly collected\r\ninformation for me, states that about 1760 these cattle were kept as\r\ncuriosities near Buenos Ayres. Their origin is not positively known, but\r\nthey must have originated subsequently to the year 1552, when cattle were\r\nfirst introduced. Signor Muniz informs me that the breed is believed to\r\nhave originated with the Indians southward of the Plata. Even to this day\r\nthose reared near the Plata show their less civilized nature in being\r\nfiercer than common cattle, and in the cow, if visited too often, easily\r\ndeserting her first calf. The breed is very true, and a niata bull and cow\r\ninvariably produce niata calves. The breed has already lasted at least a\r\ncentury. A niata bull crossed with a common cow, and the reverse cross,\r\nyield offspring having an intermediate character, but with the niata\r\ncharacter strongly displayed. According to Signor Muniz, there is the\r\nclearest evidence, contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in\r\nanalogous cases, that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull\r\ntransmits her peculiarities more strongly than does the niata bull when\r\ncrossed with a common cow. When the pasture is tolerably long, these cattle\r\nfeed as well as common cattle with their tongue and palate; but during the\r\ngreat droughts, when so many animals perish on the Pampas, the niata breed\r\nlies under a great disadvantage, and would, if not attended to, become\r\nextinct; for the common cattle, like horses, are able just to keep alive by\r\nbrowsing on the twigs of trees and on reeds with their lips: this the\r\nniatas cannot so {91} well do, as their lips do not join, and hence they\r\nare found to perish before the common cattle. This strikes me as a good\r\nillustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of\r\nan animal, on what circumstances, occurring only at long intervals of time,\r\nits rarity or extinction may depend. It shows us, also, how natural\r\nselection would have determined the rejection of the niata modification had\r\nit arisen in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nHaving described the semi-monstrous niata breed, I may allude to a white\r\nbull, said to have been brought from Africa, which was exhibited in London\r\nin 1829, and which has been well figured by Mr. Harvey.[210] It had a hump,\r\nand was furnished with a mane. The dewlap was peculiar, being divided\r\nbetween its fore-legs into parallel divisions. Its lateral hoofs were\r\nannually shed, and grew to the length of five or six inches. The eye was\r\nvery peculiar, being remarkably prominent, and \"resembled a cup and ball,\r\nthus enabling the animal to see on all sides with equal ease; the pupil was\r\nsmall and oval, or rather a parallelogram with the ends cut off, and lying\r\ntransversely across the ball,\" A new and strange breed might probably have\r\nbeen formed by careful breeding and selection from this animal.\r\n\r\nI have often speculated on the probable causes through which each separate\r\ndistrict in Great Britain came to possess in former times its own peculiar\r\nbreed of cattle; and the question is, perhaps, even more perplexing in the\r\ncase of Southern Africa. We now know that the differences may be in part\r\nattributed to descent from distinct species; but this will not suffice.\r\nHave the slight differences in climate and in the nature of the pasture, in\r\nthe different districts of Britain, directly induced corresponding\r\ndifferences in the cattle? We have seen that the semi-wild cattle in the\r\nseveral British parks are not identical in colouring or size, and that some\r\ndegree of selection has been requisite to keep them true. It is almost\r\ncertain that abundant food given during many generations directly affects\r\nthe size of a breed.[211] That climate directly affects the thickness of\r\nthe {92} skin and the hair is likewise certain: thus Roulin asserts[212]\r\nthat the hides of the feral cattle on the hot Llanos \"are always much less\r\nheavy than those of the cattle raised on the high platform of Bogota; and\r\nthat these hides yield in weight and in thickness of hair to those of the\r\ncattle which have run wild on the lofty Paramos.\" The same difference has\r\nbeen observed in the hides of the cattle reared on the bleak Falkland\r\nIslands and on the temperate Pampas. Low has remarked[213] that the cattle\r\nwhich inhabit the more humid parts of Britain have longer hair and thicker\r\nskins than other British cattle; and the hair and horns are so closely\r\nrelated to each other, that, as we shall see in a future chapter, they are\r\napt to vary together; thus climate might indirectly affect, through the\r\nskin, the form and size of the horns. When we compare highly improved\r\nstall-fed cattle with the wilder breeds, or compare mountain and lowland\r\nbreeds, we cannot doubt that an active life, leading to the free use of the\r\nlimbs and lungs, affects the shape and proportions of the whole body. It is\r\nprobable that some breeds, such as the semi-monstrous niata cattle, and\r\nsome peculiarities, such as being hornless, &c., have appeared suddenly\r\nfrom what we may call a spontaneous variation; but even in this case a rude\r\nkind of selection is necessary, and the animals thus characterized must be\r\nat least partially separated from others. This degree of care, however, has\r\nsometimes been taken even in little-civilized districts, where we should\r\nleast have expected it, as in the case of the niata, chivo, and hornless\r\ncattle in S. America.\r\n\r\nThat methodical selection has done wonders within a recent period in\r\nmodifying our cattle, no one doubts. During the process of methodical\r\nselection it has occasionally happened that deviations of structure, more\r\nstrongly pronounced than mere individual differences, yet by no means\r\ndeserving to be called monstrosities, have been taken advantage of: thus\r\nthe famous Long-horn Bull, Shakespeare, though of the pure Canley stock,\r\n\"scarcely inherited a single point of the long-horned breed, his horns\r\nexcepted;[214] yet in the hands of Mr. Fowler, {93} this bull greatly\r\nimproved his race. We have also reason to believe that selection, carried\r\non so far unconsciously that there was at no one time any distinct\r\nintention to improve or change the breed, has in the course of time\r\nmodified most of our cattle; for by this process, aided by more abundant\r\nfood, all the lowland British breeds have increased greatly in size and in\r\nearly maturity since the reign of Henry VII.[215] It should never be\r\nforgotten that many animals have to be annually slaughtered; so that each\r\nowner must determine which shall be killed and which preserved for\r\nbreeding. In every district, as Youatt has remarked, there is a prejudice\r\nin favour of the native breed; so that animals possessing qualities,\r\nwhatever they may be, which are most valued in each district, will be\r\noftenest preserved; and this unmethodical selection assuredly will in the\r\nlong run affect the character of the whole breed. But it may be asked, can\r\nthis rude kind of selection have been practised by barbarians such as those\r\nof southern Africa? In a future chapter on Selection we shall see that this\r\nhas certainly occurred to some extent. Therefore, looking to the origin of\r\nthe many breeds of cattle which formerly inhabited the several districts of\r\nBritain, I conclude that, although slight differences in the nature of the\r\nclimate, food, &c., as well as changed habits of life, aided by correlation\r\nof growth, and the occasional appearance from unknown causes of\r\nconsiderable deviations of structure, have all probably played their parts;\r\nyet that the occasional preservation in each district of those individual\r\nanimals which were most valued by each owner has perhaps been even more\r\neffective in the production of the several British breeds. As soon as two\r\nor more breeds had once been formed in any district, or when new breeds\r\ndescended from distinct species were introduced, their crossing, especially\r\nif aided by some selection, will have multiplied the number and modified\r\nthe characters of the older breeds.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\nI shall treat this subject briefly. Most authors look at our domestic sheep\r\nas descended from several distinct species; but how many still exist is\r\ndoubtful. Mr. Blyth believes that there {94} are in the whole world\r\nfourteen species, one of which, the Corsican moufflon, he concludes (as I\r\nam informed by him) to be the parent of the smaller, short-tailed breeds,\r\nwith crescent-shaped horns, such as the old Highland sheep. The larger,\r\nlong-tailed breeds, having horns with a double flexure, such as the\r\nDorsets, merinos, &c., he believes to be descended from an unknown and\r\nextinct species. M. Gervais makes six species of Ovis;[216] but concludes\r\nthat our domestic sheep form a distinct genus, now completely extinct. A\r\nGerman naturalist[217] believes that our sheep descend from ten\r\naboriginally distinct species, of which only one is still living in a wild\r\nstate! Another ingenious observer,[218] though not a naturalist, with a\r\nbold defiance of everything known on geographical distribution, infers that\r\nthe sheep of Great Britain alone are the descendants of eleven endemic\r\nBritish forms! Under such a hopeless state of doubt it would be useless for\r\nmy purpose to give a detailed account of the several breeds; but a few\r\nremarks may be added.\r\n\r\nSheep have been domesticated from a very ancient period. Rütimeyer[219]\r\nfound in the Swiss lake-dwellings the remains of a small breed, with thin\r\nand tall legs, and with horns like those of a goat: this race differs\r\nsomewhat from any one now known. Almost every country has its own peculiar\r\nbreed; and many countries have many breeds differing greatly from each\r\nother. One of the most strongly marked races is an Eastern one with a long\r\ntail, including, according to Pallas, twenty vertebræ, and so loaded with\r\nfat, that, from being esteemed a delicacy, it is sometimes placed on a\r\ntruck which is dragged about by the living animal. These sheep, though\r\nranked by Fitzinger as a distinct aboriginal form, seem to bear in their\r\ndrooping ears the stamp of long domestication. This is likewise the case\r\nwith those sheep which have two great masses of fat on the rump, with the\r\ntail in a rudimentary condition. The Angola variety of {95} the long-tailed\r\nrace has curious masses of fat on the back of the head and beneath the\r\njaws.[220] Mr. Hodgson in an admirable paper[221] on the sheep of the\r\nHimalaya infers from the distribution of the several races, \"that this\r\ncaudal augmentation in most of its phases is an instance of degeneracy in\r\nthese pre-eminently Alpine animals.\" The horns present an endless diversity\r\nin character; being, especially in the female sex, not rarely absent, or,\r\non the other hand, amounting to four or even eight in number. The horns,\r\nwhen numerous, arise from a crest on the frontal bone, which is elevated in\r\na peculiar manner. It is remarkable that multiplicity of horns \"is\r\ngenerally accompanied by great length and coarseness of the fleece.\"[222]\r\nThis correlation, however, is not invariable; for I am informed by Mr. D.\r\nForbes, that the Spanish sheep in Chile resemble, in fleece and in all\r\nother characters, their parent merino-race, except that instead of a pair\r\nthey generally bear four horns. The existence of a pair of mammæ is a\r\ngeneric character in the genus Ovis as well as in several allied forms;\r\nnevertheless, as Mr. Hodgson has remarked, \"this character is not\r\nabsolutely constant even among the true and proper sheep: for I have more\r\nthan once met with Cágias (a sub-Himalayan domestic race) possessed of four\r\nteats.\"[223] This case is the more remarkable as, when any part or organ is\r\npresent in reduced number in comparison with the same part in allied\r\ngroups, it usually is subject to little variation. The presence of\r\ninterdigital pits has likewise been considered as a generic distinction in\r\nsheep; but Isidore Geoffroy[224] has shown that these pits or pouches are\r\nabsent in some breeds.\r\n\r\nIn sheep there is a strong tendency for characters, which have apparently\r\nbeen acquired under domestication, to become attached either exclusively to\r\nthe male sex, or to be more highly developed in this than in the other sex.\r\nThus in many breeds the horns are deficient in the ewe, though this\r\nlikewise occurs occasionally with the female of the wild musmon. In the\r\nrams of the Wallachian breed \"the horns spring almost perpendicularly {96}\r\nfrom the frontal bone, and then take a beautiful spiral form; in the ewes\r\nthey protrude nearly at right angles from the head, and then become twisted\r\nin a singular manner.\"[225] Mr. Hodgson states that the extraordinarily\r\narched nose or chaffron, which is so highly developed in several foreign\r\nbreeds, is characteristic of the ram alone, and apparently is the result of\r\ndomestication.[226] I hear from Mr. Blyth that the accumulation of fat in\r\nthe fat-tailed sheep of the plains of India is greater in the male than in\r\nthe female; and Fitzinger[227] remarks that the mane in the African maned\r\nrace is far more developed in the ram than in the ewe.\r\n\r\nDifferent races of sheep, like cattle, present constitutional differences.\r\nThus the improved breeds arrive at maturity at an early age, as has been\r\nwell shown by Mr. Simonds through their early average period of dentition.\r\nThe several races have become adapted to different kinds of pasture and\r\nclimate: for instance, no one can rear Leicester sheep on mountainous\r\nregions, where Cheviots flourish. As Youatt has remarked, \"in all the\r\ndifferent districts of Great Britain we find various breeds of sheep\r\nbeautifully adapted to the locality which they occupy. No one knows their\r\norigin; they are indigenous to the soil, climate, pasturage, and the\r\nlocality on which they graze; they seem to have been formed for it and by\r\nit.\"[228] Marshall relates[229] that a flock of heavy Lincolnshire and\r\nlight Norfolk sheep which had been bred together in a large sheep-walk,\r\npart of which was low, rich, and moist, and another part high and dry, with\r\nbenty grass, when turned out, regularly separated from each other; the\r\nheavy sheep drawing off to the rich soil, and the lighter sheep to their\r\nown soil; so that \"whilst there was plenty of grass the two breeds kept\r\nthemselves as distinct as rooks and pigeons.\" Numerous sheep from various\r\nparts of the world have been brought during a long course of years to the\r\nZoological Gardens of London; but as Youatt, who attended the animals as a\r\n{97} veterinary surgeon, remarks, \"few or none die of the rot, but they are\r\nphthisical; not one of them from a torrid climate lasts out the second\r\nyear, and when they die their lungs are tuberculated.\"[230] Even in certain\r\nparts of England it has been found impossible to keep certain breeds of\r\nsheep; thus on a farm on the banks of the Ouse, the Leicester sheep were so\r\nrapidly destroyed by pleuritis[231] that the owner could not keep them; the\r\ncoarser-skinned sheep never being affected.\r\n\r\nThe period of gestation was formerly thought to be so unalterable a\r\ncharacter, that a supposed difference between the wolf and the dog in this\r\nrespect was esteemed a sure sign of specific distinction; but we have seen\r\nthat the period is shorter in the improved breeds of the pig, and in the\r\nlarger breeds of the ox, than in other breeds of these two animals. And now\r\nwe know, on the excellent authority of Hermann von Nathusius,[232] that\r\nMerino and Southdown sheep, when both have long been kept under exactly the\r\nsame conditions, differ in their average period of gestation, as is seen in\r\nthe following Table:--\r\n\r\n  Merinos                            150.3 days.\r\n  Southdowns                         144.2  \"\r\n  Half-bred Merinos and Southdowns   146.3  \"\r\n  ¾ blood of Southdown             145.5  \"\r\n  7/8         \"      \"               144.2  \"\r\n\r\nIn this graduated difference, in these cross-bred animals having different\r\nproportions of Southdown blood, we see how strictly the two periods of\r\ngestation have been transmitted. Nathusius remarks that, as Southdowns grow\r\nwith remarkable rapidity after birth, it is not surprising that their\r\nfoetal development should have been shortened. It is of course possible\r\nthat the difference in these two breeds may be due to their descent from\r\ndistinct parent-species; but as the early maturity of the Southdowns has\r\nlong been carefully attended to by breeders, the difference is more\r\nprobably the result of such attention. Lastly, the fecundity of the several\r\nbreeds differs much; some generally producing twins or even triplets at a\r\nbirth, of which fact the curious Shangai sheep (with their truncated and\r\nrudimentary {98} ears, and great Roman noses), lately exhibited in the\r\nZoological Gardens, offer a remarkable instance.\r\n\r\nSheep are perhaps more readily affected by the direct action of the\r\nconditions of life to which they have been exposed than almost any other\r\ndomestic animal. According to Pallas, and more recently according to Erman,\r\nthe fat-tailed Kirghisian sheep, when bred for a few generations in Russia,\r\ndegenerate, and the mass of fat dwindles away, \"the scanty and bitter\r\nherbage of the steppes seems so essential to their development.\" Pallas\r\nmakes an analogous statement with respect to one of the Crimean breeds.\r\nBurnes states that the Karakool breed, which produces a fine, curled,\r\nblack, and valuable fleece, when removed from its own canton near Bokhara\r\nto Persia or to other quarters, loses its peculiar fleece.[233] In all such\r\ncases, however, it may be that a change of any kind in the conditions of\r\nlife causes variability and consequent loss of character, and not that\r\ncertain conditions are necessary for the development of certain characters.\r\n\r\nGreat heat, however, seems to act directly on the fleece: several accounts\r\nhave been published of the change which sheep imported from Europe undergo\r\nin the West Indies. Dr. Nicholson of Antigua informs me that, after the\r\nthird generation, the wool disappears from the whole body, except over the\r\nloins; and the animal then appears like a goat with a dirty door-mat on its\r\nback. A similar change is said to take place on the west coast of\r\nAfrica.[234] On the other hand, many wool-bearing sheep live on the hot\r\nplains of India. Roulin asserts that in the lower and heated valleys of the\r\nCordillera, if the lambs are sheared as soon as the wool has grown to a\r\ncertain thickness, all goes on afterwards as usual; but if not sheared, the\r\nwool detaches itself in flakes, and short shining hair like that {99} on a\r\ngoat is produced ever afterwards. This curious result seems merely to be an\r\nexaggerated tendency natural to the Merino breed, for as a great authority,\r\nnamely, Lord Somerville, remarks, \"the wool of our Merino sheep after\r\nshear-time is hard and coarse to such a degree as to render it almost\r\nimpossible to suppose that the same animal could bear wool so opposite in\r\nquality, compared to that which has been clipped from it: as the cold\r\nweather advances, the fleeces recover their soft quality.\" As in sheep of\r\nall breeds the fleece naturally consists of longer and coarser hair\r\ncovering shorter and softer wool, the change which it often undergoes in\r\nhot climates is probably merely a case of unequal development; for even\r\nwith those sheep which like goats are covered with hair, a small quantity\r\nof underlying wool may always be found.[235] In the wild mountain-sheep\r\n(_Ovis montana_) of North America there is an annual analogous change of\r\ncoat; \"the wool begins to drop out in early spring, leaving in its place a\r\ncoat of hair resembling that of the elk, a change of pelage quite different\r\nin character from the ordinary thickening of the coat or hair, common to\r\nall furred animals in winter,--for instance, in the horse, the cow, &c.,\r\nwhich shed their winter coat in the spring.\"[236]\r\n\r\nA slight difference in climate or pasture sometimes slightly affects the\r\nfleece, as has been observed even in different districts in England, and as\r\nis well shown by the great softness of the wool brought from Southern\r\nAustralia. But it should be observed, as Youatt repeatedly insists, that\r\nthe tendency to change may generally be counteracted by careful selection.\r\nM. Lasterye, after discussing this subject, sums up as follows: \"The\r\npreservation of the Merino race in its utmost purity at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, in the marshes of Holland, and under the rigorous climate of Sweden,\r\nfurnishes an additional support of this my unalterable principle, that\r\nfine-woolled sheep may be kept wherever industrious men and intelligent\r\nbreeders exist.\"\r\n\r\nThat methodical selection has effected great changes in several {100}\r\nbreeds of sheep no one, who knows anything on the subject, entertains a\r\ndoubt. The case of the Southdowns, as improved by Ellman, offers perhaps\r\nthe most striking instance. Unconscious or occasional selection has\r\nlikewise slowly produced a great effect, as we shall see in the chapters on\r\nSelection. That crossing has largely modified some breeds, no one who will\r\nstudy what has been written on this subject--for instance, Mr. Spooner's\r\npaper--will dispute; but to produce uniformity, in a crossed breed, careful\r\nselection and \"rigorous weeding,\" as this author expresses it, are\r\nindispensable.[237]\r\n\r\nIn some few instances new breeds have suddenly originated; thus, in 1791, a\r\nram-lamb was born in Massachusetts, having short crooked legs and a long\r\nback, like a turnspit-dog. From this one lamb the _otter_ or _ancon_\r\nsemi-monstrous breed was raised; as these sheep could not leap over the\r\nfences, it was thought that they would be valuable; but they have been\r\nsupplanted by merinos, and thus exterminated. These sheep are remarkable\r\nfrom transmitting their character so truly that Colonel Humphreys[238]\r\nnever heard of \"but one questionable case\" of an ancon ram and ewe not\r\nproducing ancon offspring. When they are crossed with other breeds the\r\noffspring, with rare exceptions, instead of being intermediate in\r\ncharacter, perfectly resemble either parent; and this has occurred even in\r\nthe case of twins. Lastly, \"the ancons have been observed to keep together,\r\nseparating themselves from the rest of the flock when put into enclosures\r\nwith other sheep.\"\r\n\r\nA more interesting case has been recorded in the Report of the Juries for\r\nthe Great Exhibition (1851), namely, the production of a merino ram-lamb on\r\nthe Mauchamp farm, in 1828, which was remarkable for its long, smooth,\r\nstraight, and silky wool. By the year 1833 M. Graux had raised rams enough\r\nto serve his whole flock, and after a few more years he was able to sell\r\nstock of his new breed. So peculiar and valuable is the wool, that it sells\r\nat 25 per cent. above the best merino wool: even the fleeces of half-bred\r\nanimals are valuable, and are known in France as the \"Mauchamp-merino.\" It\r\nis interesting, as {101} showing how generally any marked deviation of\r\nstructure is accompanied by other deviations, that the first ram and his\r\nimmediate offspring were of small size, with large heads, long necks,\r\nnarrow chests, and long flanks; but these blemishes were removed by\r\njudicious crosses and selection. The long smooth wool was also correlated\r\nwith smooth horns; and as horns and hair are homologous structures, we can\r\nunderstand the meaning of this correlation. If the Mauchamp and ancon\r\nbreeds had originated a century or two ago, we should have had no record of\r\ntheir birth; and many a naturalist would no doubt have insisted, especially\r\nin the case of the Mauchamp race, that they had each descended from, or\r\nbeen crossed with, some unknown aboriginal form.\r\n\r\nGOATS.\r\n\r\nFrom the recent researches of M. Brandt, most naturalists now believe that\r\nall our goats are descended from the _Capra ægagrus_ of the mountains of\r\nAsia, possibly mingled with the allied Indian species _C. Falconeri_ of\r\nIndia.[239] In Switzerland, during the early Stone period, the domestic\r\ngoat was commoner than the sheep; and this very ancient race differed in no\r\nrespect from that now common in Switzerland.[240] At the present time, the\r\nmany races found in several parts of the world differ greatly from each\r\nother; nevertheless, as far as they have been tried,[241] they are all\r\nquite fertile when crossed. So numerous are the breeds, that Mr. G.\r\nClark[242] has described eight distinct kinds imported into the one island\r\nof Mauritius. The ears of one kind were enormously developed, being, as\r\nmeasured by Mr. Clark, no less than 19 inches in length and 4¾ inches in\r\nbreadth. As with cattle, the mammæ of those breeds which are regularly\r\nmilked become greatly developed; and, as Mr. Clark remarks, \"it is not rare\r\nto see their teats touching the ground.\" The following cases are worth\r\nnotice as presenting unusual {102} points of variation. According to\r\nGodron,[243] the mammæ differ greatly in shape in different breeds, being\r\nelongated in the common goat, hemispherical in the Angora race, and bilobed\r\nand divergent in the goats of Syria and Nubia. According to this same\r\nauthor, the males of certain breeds have lost their usual offensive odour.\r\nIn one of the Indian breeds the males and females have horns of\r\nwidely-different shapes;[244] and in some breeds the females are destitute\r\nof horns.[245] The presence of interdigital pits or glands on all four feet\r\nhas been thought to characterise the genus Ovis, and their absence to be\r\ncharacteristic of the genus Capra; but Mr. Hodgson has found that they\r\nexist in the front feet of the majority of Himalayan goats.[246] Mr.\r\nHodgson measured the intestines in two goats of the Dúgú race, and he found\r\nthat the proportional length of the great and small intestines differed\r\nconsiderably. In one of these goats the cæcum was thirteen inches, and in\r\nthe other no less than thirty-six inches in length!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{103}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC RABBITS.\r\n\r\n    DOMESTIC RABBITS DESCENDED FROM THE COMMON WILD RABBIT--ANCIENT\r\n    DOMESTICATION--ANCIENT SELECTION--LARGE LOP-EARED RABBITS--VARIOUS\r\n    BREEDS--FLUCTUATING CHARACTERS--ORIGIN OF THE HIMALAYAN BREED--CURIOUS\r\n    CASE OF INHERITANCE--FERAL RABBITS IN JAMAICA AND THE FALKLAND\r\n    ISLANDS--PORTO SANTO FERAL RABBITS--OSTEOLOGICAL\r\n    CHARACTERS--SKULL--SKULL OF HALF-LOP RABBITS--VARIATIONS IN THE SKULL\r\n    ANALOGOUS TO DIFFERENCES IN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF\r\n    HARES--VERTEBRÆ--STERNUM--SCAPULA--EFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE ON THE\r\n    PROPORTIONS OF THE LIMBS AND BODY--CAPACITY OF THE SKULL AND REDUCED\r\n    SIZE OF THE BRAIN--SUMMARY ON THE MODIFICATIONS OF DOMESTICATED\r\n    RABBITS.\r\n\r\nAll naturalists, with, as far as I know, a single exception, believe that\r\nthe several domestic breeds of the rabbit are descended from the common\r\nwild species; I shall therefore describe them more carefully than in the\r\nprevious cases. Professor Gervais[247] states \"that the true wild rabbit is\r\nsmaller than the domestic; its proportions are not absolutely the same; its\r\ntail is smaller; its ears are shorter and more thickly clothed with hair;\r\nand these characters, without speaking of colour, are so many indications\r\nopposed to the opinion which unites these animals under the same specific\r\ndenomination.\" Few naturalists will agree with this author that such slight\r\ndifferences are sufficient to separate as distinct species the wild and\r\ndomestic rabbit. How extraordinary it would be, if close confinement,\r\nperfect tameness, unnatural food, and careful breeding, all prolonged\r\nduring many generations, had not produced at least some effect! The tame\r\nrabbit has been domesticated from an ancient period. Confucius ranges\r\nrabbits among animals worthy to be sacrificed to the gods, and, as he\r\nprescribes their multiplication, they were probably at this early period\r\ndomesticated in China. They are mentioned by several of the classical\r\nwriters. {104} In 1631 Gervaise Markham writes, \"You shall not, as in other\r\ncattell, looke to their shape, but to their richnesse, onely elect your\r\nbuckes, the largest and goodliest conies you can get; and for the richnesse\r\nof the skin, that is accounted the richest which hath the equallest mixture\r\nof blacke and white haire together, yet the blacke rather shadowing the\r\nwhite; the furre should be thicke, deepe, smooth, and shining; ... they are\r\nof body much fatter and larger, and, when another skin is worth two or\r\nthree pence, they are worth two shillings.\" From this full description we\r\nsee that silver-grey rabbits existed in England at this period; and, what\r\nis far more important, we see that the breeding or selection of rabbits was\r\nthen carefully attended to. Aldrovandi, in 1637, describes, on the\r\nauthority of several old writers (as Scaliger, in 1557), rabbits of various\r\ncolours, some \"like a hare,\" and he adds that P. Valerianus (who died a\r\nvery old man in 1558) saw at Verona rabbits four times bigger than\r\nours.[248]\r\n\r\nFrom the fact of the rabbit having been domesticated at an ancient period,\r\nwe must look to the northern hemisphere of the Old World, and to the warmer\r\ntemperate regions alone, for the aboriginal parent-form; for the rabbit\r\ncannot live without protection in countries as cold as Sweden, and, though\r\nit has run wild in the tropical island of Jamaica, it has never greatly\r\nmultiplied there. It now exists, and has long existed, in the warmer\r\ntemperate parts of Europe, for fossil remains have been found in several\r\ncountries.[249] The domestic rabbit readily becomes feral in these same\r\ncountries, and when variously coloured kinds are turned out they generally\r\nrevert to the ordinary grey colour.[250] The wild rabbits, if taken young,\r\ncan be domesticated, though the process is generally very troublesome.[251]\r\nThe various {105} domestic races are often crossed, and are believed to be\r\nperfectly fertile together, and a perfect gradation can be shown to exist\r\nfrom the largest domestic kinds, having enormously developed ears, to the\r\ncommon wild kind. The parent-form must have been a burrowing animal, a\r\nhabit not common, as far as I can discover, to any other species in the\r\nlarge genus Lepus. Only one wild species is known with certainty to exist\r\nin Europe; but the rabbit (if it be a true rabbit) from Mount Sinai, and\r\nlikewise that from Algeria, present slight differences; and these forms\r\nhave been considered by some authors as specifically distinct.[252] But\r\nsuch slight differences would aid us little in explaining the more\r\nconsiderable differences characteristic of the several domestic races. If\r\nthe latter are the descendants of two or more closely allied species, all,\r\nexcepting the common rabbit, have been exterminated in a wild state; and\r\nthis is very improbable, seeing with what pertinacity this animal holds its\r\nground. From these several reasons we may infer with safety that all the\r\ndomestic breeds are the descendants of the common wild species. But from\r\nwhat we hear of the late marvellous success in rearing hybrids between the\r\nhare and rabbit,[253] it is possible, though not probable, from the great\r\ndifficulty in making the first cross, that some of the larger races, which\r\nare coloured like the hare, may have been modified by crosses with this\r\nanimal. Nevertheless, the chief differences in the skeletons of the several\r\ndomestic breeds cannot, as we shall presently see, have been derived from a\r\ncross with the hare.\r\n\r\nThere are many breeds which transmit their characters more or less truly.\r\nEvery one has seen the enormous lop-eared rabbits exhibited at our shows;\r\nvarious allied sub-breeds are reared on the Continent, such as the\r\nso-called Andalusian, which is said to have a large head with a round\r\nforehead, and to attain a greater size than any other kind; another large\r\nParis breed is named the Rouennais, and has a square head; the so-called\r\nPatagonian rabbit has remarkably short ears and a large round head.\r\nAlthough I have not seen all these breeds, I feel some doubt about there\r\nbeing any marked difference in the {106} shape of their skulls.[254]\r\nEnglish lop-eared rabbits often weigh 8 lbs. or 10 lbs., and one has been\r\nexhibited weighing 18 lbs.; whereas a full-sized wild rabbit weighs only\r\nabout 3¼ lbs. The head or skull in all the large lop-eared rabbits examined\r\nby me is much longer relatively to its breadth than in the wild rabbit.\r\nMany of them have loose transverse folds of skin or dewlaps beneath the\r\nthroat, which can be pulled out so as to reach nearly to the ends of the\r\njaws. Their ears are prodigiously developed, and hang down on each side of\r\ntheir faces. A rabbit has been exhibited with its two ears, measured from\r\nthe tip of one to the tip of the other, 22 inches in length, and each ear\r\nwas 5-3/8 inches in breadth. In a common wild rabbit I found that the\r\nlength of the two ears, from tip to tip, was 7-5/8 inches, and the breadth\r\nonly 1-7/8 inch. The great weight of the body in the larger rabbits, and\r\nthe immense development of their ears, are the qualities which win prizes,\r\nand have been carefully selected.\r\n\r\nThe hare-coloured, or, as it is sometimes called, the Belgian rabbit,\r\ndiffers in nothing except colour from the other large breeds; but Mr. J.\r\nYoung, of Southampton, a great breeder of this kind, informs me that the\r\nfemales, in all the specimens examined by him, had only six mammæ; and this\r\ncertainly was the case with two females which came into my possession. Mr.\r\nB. P. Brent, however, assures me that the number is variable with other\r\ndomestic rabbits. The common wild rabbit always has ten mammæ. The Angora\r\nrabbit is remarkable from the length and fineness of its fur, which even on\r\nthe soles of the feet is of considerable length. This breed is the only one\r\nwhich differs in its mental qualities, for it is said to be much more\r\nsociable than other rabbits, and the male shows no wish to destroy its\r\nyoung.[255] Two live rabbits were brought to me from Moscow, of about the\r\nsize of the wild species, but with long soft fur, different from that of\r\nthe Angora. These Moscow rabbits had pink eyes and were snow-white,\r\nexcepting the ears, two spots near the nose, the upper and under surface of\r\nthe tail, and the hinder tarsi, which were blackish-brown. In short, they\r\nwere {107} coloured nearly like the so-called Himalayan rabbits, presently\r\nto be described, and differed from them only in the character of their fur.\r\nThere are two other breeds which come true to colour, but differ in no\r\nother respect, namely silver-greys and chinchillas. Lastly, the Nicard or\r\nDutch rabbit may be mentioned, which varies in colour, and is remarkable\r\nfrom its small size, some specimens weighing only 1¼ lb.; rabbits of this\r\nbreed make excellent nurses for other and more delicate kinds.[256]\r\n\r\nCertain characters are remarkably fluctuating, or are very feebly\r\ntransmitted by domestic rabbits: thus, one breeder tells me that with the\r\nsmaller kinds he has hardly ever raised a whole litter of the same colour:\r\nwith the large lop-eared breeds \"it is impossible,\" says a great\r\njudge,[257] \"to breed true to colour, but by judicious crossing a great\r\ndeal may be done towards it. The fancier should know how his does are bred,\r\nthat is, the colour of their parents.\" Nevertheless, certain colours, as we\r\nshall presently see, are transmitted truly. The dewlap is not strictly\r\ninherited. Lop-eared rabbits, with their ears hanging flat down on each\r\nside of the face, do not transmit this character at all truly. Mr. Delamer\r\nremarks that, \"with fancy rabbits, when both the parents are perfectly\r\nformed, have model ears, and are handsomely marked, their progeny do not\r\ninvariably turn out the same.\" When one parent, or even both, are oar-laps,\r\nthat is, have their ears sticking out at right angles, or when one parent\r\nor both are half-lops, that is, have only one ear dependent, there is\r\nnearly as good a chance of the progeny having both ears full-lop, as if\r\nboth parents had been thus characterized. But I am informed, if both\r\nparents have upright ears, there is hardly a chance of a full-lop. In some\r\nhalf-lops the ear that hangs down is broader and longer than the upright\r\near;[258] so that we have the unusual case of a want of symmetry on the two\r\nsides. This difference in the position and size of the two ears probably\r\nindicates that the lopping of the ear results {108} from its great length\r\nand weight, favoured no doubt by the weakness of the muscles consequent on\r\ndisuse. Anderson[259] mentions a breed having only a single ear; and\r\nProfessor Gervais another breed which is destitute of ears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Half-lop Rabbit. (Copied from E. S. Delamer's\r\nwork.)]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Himalayan breed (sometimes called Chinese, or Polish, or\r\nRussian) is so curious, both in itself, and as throwing some light on the\r\ncomplex laws of inheritance, that it is worth giving in detail. These\r\npretty rabbits are white, except their ears, nose, all four feet, and the\r\nupper side of tail, which are all brownish-black; but as they have red\r\neyes, they may be considered as albinoes. I have received several accounts\r\nof their breeding perfectly true. From their symmetrical marks, they were\r\nat first ranked as specifically distinct, and were provisionally named _L.\r\nnigripes_[260] Some good observers thought that they could detect a\r\ndifference in their habits, and stoutly maintained that they formed a new\r\nspecies. Their origin is now well known. A writer, in 1857,[261] stated\r\nthat he had produced Himalayan rabbits in the following manner. But it is\r\nfirst necessary briefly to describe two other breeds: silver-greys or\r\nsilver-sprigs generally have black heads and legs, and their fine grey fur\r\nis interspersed with numerous black and white long hairs. {109} They breed\r\nperfectly true, and have long been kept in warrens. When they escape and\r\ncross with common rabbits, the product, as I hear from Mr. Wyrley Birch, of\r\nWretham Hall, is not a mixture of the two colours, but about half take\r\nafter the one parent, and the other half after the other parent. Secondly,\r\nchinchillas or tame silver-greys (I will use the former name) have short,\r\npaler, mouse or slate-coloured fur, interspersed with long, blackish,\r\nslate-coloured, and white hairs.[262] These rabbits breed perfectly true.\r\nNow, the writer above referred to had a breed of chinchillas which had been\r\ncrossed with the common black rabbit, and their offspring were either\r\nblacks or chinchillas. These latter were again crossed with other\r\nchinchillas (which had also been crossed with silver-greys), and from this\r\ncomplicated cross Himalayan rabbits were raised. From these and other\r\nsimilar statements, Mr. Bartlett[263] was led to make a careful trial in\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, and he found that by simply crossing silver-greys\r\nwith chinchillas he could always produce some few Himalayans; and the\r\nlatter, notwithstanding their sudden origin, if kept separate, bred\r\nperfectly true.\r\n\r\nThe Himalayans, when first born, are quite white, and are then true\r\nalbinoes; but in the course of a few months they gradually assume their\r\ndark ears, nose, feet, and tail. Occasionally, however, as I am informed by\r\nMr. W. A. Wooler and the Rev. W. D. Fox, the young are born of a very pale\r\ngrey colour, and specimens of such fur were sent me by the former\r\ngentleman. The grey tint, however, disappears as the animal comes to\r\nmaturity. So that with these Himalayans there is a tendency, strictly\r\nconfined to early youth, to revert to the colour of the adult silver-grey\r\nparent-stock. Silver-greys and chinchillas, on the other hand, present a\r\nremarkable contrast in their colour whilst quite young, for they are born\r\nperfectly black, but soon assume their characteristic grey or silver tints.\r\nThe same thing occurs with grey horses, which, as long as they are foals,\r\nare generally of a nearly black colour, but soon become grey, and get\r\nwhiter and whiter as they grow older. Hence the usual rule is that\r\nHimalayans are born white and afterwards become in certain parts of their\r\nbodies dark-coloured; whilst {110} silver-greys are born black and\r\nafterwards become sprinkled with white. Exceptions, however, and of a\r\ndirectly opposite nature, occasionally occur in both cases. For young\r\nsilver-greys are sometimes born in warrens, as I hear from Mr. W. Birch, of\r\na cream-colour, but these young animals ultimately become black, The\r\nHimalayans, on the other hand, sometimes produce, as is stated by an\r\nexperienced amateur,[264] a single black young one in a litter; but such,\r\nbefore two months elapse, become perfectly white.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the whole curious case: wild silver-greys may be considered as\r\nblack rabbits which become grey at an early period of life. When they are\r\ncrossed with common rabbits, the offspring are said not to have blended\r\ncolours, but to take after either parent; and in this respect they resemble\r\nblack and albino varieties of most quadrupeds, which often transmit their\r\ncolours in this same manner. When they are crossed with chinchillas, that\r\nis, with a paler sub-variety, the young are at first pure albinoes, but\r\nsoon become dark-coloured in certain parts of their bodies, and are then\r\ncalled Himalayans. The young Himalayans, however, are sometimes at first\r\neither pale grey or completely black, in either case changing after a time\r\nto white. In a future chapter I shall advance a large body of facts showing\r\nthat, when two varieties are crossed both of which differ in colour from\r\ntheir parent-stock, there is a strong tendency in the young to revert to\r\nthe aboriginal colour; and what is very remarkable, this reversion\r\noccasionally supervenes, not before birth, but during the growth of the\r\nanimal. Hence, if it could be shown that silver-greys and chinchillas were\r\nthe offspring of a cross between a black and albino variety with the\r\ncolours intimately blended--a supposition in itself not improbable, and\r\nsupported by the circumstance of silver-greys in warrens sometimes\r\nproducing creamy-white young, which ultimately become black--then all the\r\nabove-given paradoxical facts on the changes of colour in silver-greys and\r\nin their descendants the Himalayans would come under the law of reversion,\r\nsupervening at different periods of growth and in different degrees, either\r\nto the original black or to the original albino parent-variety.\r\n\r\n{111}\r\n\r\nIt is, also, remarkable that Himalayans, though produced so suddenly, breed\r\ntrue. But as, whilst young, they are albinoes, the case falls under a very\r\ngeneral rule; for albinism is well known to be strongly inherited, as with\r\nwhite mice and many other quadrupeds, and even with white flowers. But why,\r\nit may be asked, do the ears, tail, nose, and feet, and no other part of\r\nthe body, revert to a black colour? This apparently depends on a law, which\r\ngenerally holds good, namely, that characters common to many species of a\r\ngenus--and this, in fact, implies long inheritance in common from the\r\nancient progenitor of the genus--are found to resist variation, or to\r\nreappear if lost, more persistently than the characters which are confined\r\nto the separate species. Now, in the genus Lepus, a large majority of the\r\nspecies have their ears and the upper surface of the tail tinted black; but\r\nthe persistence of these marks is best seen in those species which in\r\nwinter become white: thus, in Scotland the _L. variabilis_[265] in its\r\nwinter dress has a shade of colour on its nose, and the tips of its ears\r\nare black: in the _L. tibetanus_ the ears are black, the upper surface of\r\nthe tail greyish-black, and the soles of the feet brown: in _L. glacialis_\r\nthe winter fur is pure white, except the soles of the feet and the points\r\nof the ears. Even in the variously-coloured fancy rabbits we may often\r\nobserve a tendency in these same parts to be more darkly tinted than the\r\nrest of the body. Thus, as it seems to me, the appearance of the several\r\ncoloured marks on the Himalayan rabbit, as it grows old, is rendered\r\nintelligible. I may add a nearly analogous case: fancy rabbits very often\r\nhave a white star on their foreheads; and the common English hare, whilst\r\nyoung, generally has, as I have myself observed, a similar white star on\r\nits forehead.\r\n\r\nWhen variously coloured rabbits are set free in Europe, and are thus placed\r\nunder their natural conditions, they generally revert to the aboriginal\r\ngrey colour; this may be in part due to the tendency in all crossed\r\nanimals, as lately observed, to revert to their primordial state. But this\r\ntendency does not always prevail; thus silver-grey rabbits are kept in\r\nwarrens, and remain true though living almost in a state of nature; but a\r\n{112} warren must not be stocked with both silver-greys and common rabbits;\r\notherwise \"in a few years there will be none but common greys\r\nsurviving.\"[266] When rabbits run wild in foreign countries, under\r\ndifferent conditions of life, they by no means always revert to their\r\naboriginal colour. In Jamaica the feral rabbits are described as\r\n\"slate-coloured, deeply tinted with sprinklings of white on the neck, on\r\nthe shoulders, and on the back; softening off to blue-white under the\r\nbreast and belly.\"[267] But in this tropical island the conditions were not\r\nfavourable to their increase, and they never spread widely; and, as I hear\r\nfrom Mr. R. Hill, owing to a great fire which occurred in the woods, they\r\nhave now become extinct. Rabbits during many years have run wild in the\r\nFalkland Islands; they are abundant in certain parts, but do not spread\r\nextensively. Most of them are of the common grey colour; a few, as I am\r\ninformed by Admiral Sulivan, are hare-coloured, and many are black, often\r\nwith nearly symmetrical white marks on their faces. Hence, M. Lesson\r\ndescribed the black variety as a distinct species, under the name of _Lepus\r\nmagellanicus_, but this, as I have elsewhere shown, is an error.[268]\r\nWithin recent times the sealers have stocked some of the small outlying\r\nislets in the Falkland group with rabbits; and on Pebble Islet, as I hear\r\nfrom Admiral Sulivan, a large proportion are hare-coloured, whereas on\r\nRabbit Islet a large proportion are of a bluish colour which is not\r\nelsewhere seen. How the rabbits were coloured which were turned out on\r\nthese islets is not known.\r\n\r\nThe rabbits which have become feral on the island of Porto Santo, near\r\nMadeira, deserve a fuller account. In 1418 or 1419, J. Gonzales Zarco[269]\r\nhappened to have a female rabbit on board which had produced young during\r\nthe voyage, and he turned them all out on the island. These animals soon\r\nincreased so {113} rapidly, that they became a nuisance, and actually\r\ncaused the abandonment of the settlement. Thirty-seven years subsequently,\r\nCada Mosto describes them as innumerable; nor is this surprising, as the\r\nisland was not inhabited by any beast of prey or by any terrestrial mammal.\r\nWe do not know the character of the mother-rabbit; but we have every reason\r\nto believe that it was the common domesticated kind. The Spanish peninsula,\r\nwhence Zarco sailed, is known to have abounded with the common wild species\r\nat the most remote historical period. As these rabbits were taken on board\r\nfor food, it is improbable that they should have been of any peculiar\r\nbreed. That the breed was well domesticated is shown by the doe having\r\nlittered during the voyage. Mr. Wollaston, at my request, brought home two\r\nof these feral rabbits in spirits of wine; and, subsequently, Mr. W.\r\nHaywood sent to me three more specimens in brine, and two alive. These\r\nseven specimens, though caught at different periods, closely resembled each\r\nother. They were full grown, as shown by the state of their bones. Although\r\nthe conditions of life in Porto Santo are evidently highly favourable to\r\nrabbits, as proved by their extraordinarily rapid increase, yet they differ\r\nconspicuously in their small size from the wild English rabbit. Four\r\nEnglish rabbits, measured from the incisors to the anus, varied between 17\r\nand 17¾ inches in length; whilst two of the Porto Santo rabbits were only\r\n14½ and 15 inches in length. But the decrease in size is best shown by\r\nweight; four wild English rabbits averaged 3 lb. 5 oz., whilst one of the\r\nPorto Santo rabbits, which had lived for four years in the Zoological\r\nGardens, but had become thin, weighed only 1 lb. 9 oz. A fairer test is\r\nafforded by the comparison of the well-cleaned limb-bones of a P. Santo\r\nrabbit killed on the island with the same bones of a wild English rabbit of\r\naverage size, and they differed in the proportion of rather less than five\r\nto nine. So that the Porto Santo rabbits have decreased nearly three inches\r\nin length, and almost half in weight of body.[270] The head has not\r\ndecreased in length {114} proportionally with the body; and the capacity of\r\nthe brain-case is, as we shall hereafter see, singularly variable. I\r\nprepared four skulls, and these resembled each other more closely than do\r\ngenerally the skulls of wild English rabbits; but the only difference in\r\nstructure which they presented was that the supra-orbital processes of the\r\nfrontal bones were narrower.\r\n\r\nIn colour the Porto Santo rabbit differs considerably from the common\r\nrabbit; the upper surface is redder, and is rarely interspersed with any\r\nblack or black-tipped hairs. The throat and certain parts of the under\r\nsurface, instead of being pure white, are generally pale grey or leaden\r\ncolour. But the most remarkable difference is in the ears and tail; I have\r\nexamined many fresh English rabbits, and the large collection of skins in\r\nthe British Museum from various countries, and all have the upper surface\r\nof the tail and the tips of the ears clothed with blackish-grey fur; and\r\nthis is given in most works as one of the specific characters of the\r\nrabbit. Now in the seven Porto Santo rabbits the upper surface of the tail\r\nwas reddish-brown, and the tips of the ears had no trace of the black\r\nedging. But here we meet with a singular circumstance: in June, 1861, I\r\nexamined two of these rabbits recently sent to the Zoological Gardens, and\r\ntheir tails and ears were coloured as just described; but when one of their\r\ndead bodies was sent to me in February, 1865, the ears were plainly edged,\r\nand the upper surface of the tail was covered, with blackish-grey fur, and\r\nthe whole body was much less red; so that under the English climate this\r\nindividual rabbit had recovered the proper colour of its fur in rather less\r\nthan four years!\r\n\r\nThe two little Porto Santo rabbits, whilst alive in the Zoological Gardens,\r\nhad a remarkably different appearance from the common kind. They were\r\nextraordinarily wild and active, so that many persons exclaimed on seeing\r\nthem that they were more like large rats than rabbits. They were nocturnal\r\nto an unusual degree in their habits, and their wildness was never in the\r\nleast subdued; so that the superintendent, Mr. Bartlett, assured me that he\r\nhad never had a wilder animal under his charge. This is a singular fact,\r\nconsidering that they are descended from a domesticated breed; I was so\r\nmuch surprised at it, that I requested Mr. Haywood to make inquiries on the\r\nspot, {115} whether they were much hunted by the inhabitants, or persecuted\r\nby hawks, or cats, or other animals; but this is not the case, and no cause\r\ncan be assigned for their wildness. They live on the central, higher rocky\r\nland and near the sea-cliffs, and, being exceedingly shy and timid, seldom\r\nappear in the lower and cultivated districts. They are said to produce from\r\nfour to six young at a birth, and their breeding season is in July and\r\nAugust. Lastly, and this is a highly remarkable fact, Mr. Bartlett could\r\nnever succeed in getting these two rabbits, which were both males, to\r\nassociate or breed with the females of several breeds which were repeatedly\r\nplaced with them.\r\n\r\nIf the history of these Porto Santo rabbits had not been known, most\r\nnaturalists, on observing their much reduced size, their reddish colour\r\nabove and grey beneath, with neither tail nor ears tipped with black, would\r\nhave ranked them as a distinct species. They would have been strongly\r\nconfirmed in this view by seeing them alive in the Zoological Gardens, and\r\nhearing that they refused to couple with other rabbits. Yet this rabbit,\r\nwhich there can be little doubt would thus have been ranked as a distinct\r\nspecies, has certainly originated since the year 1420. Finally, from the\r\nthree cases of the rabbits which have run wild in Porto Santo, Jamaica, and\r\nthe Falkland Islands, we see that these animals do not, under new\r\nconditions of life, revert to or retain their aboriginal character, as is\r\nso generally asserted to be the case by most authors.\r\n\r\n_Osteological Characters._\r\n\r\nWhen we remember, on the one hand, how frequently it is stated that\r\nimportant parts of the structure never vary; and, on the other hand, on\r\nwhat small differences in the skeleton, fossil species have often been\r\nfounded, the variability of the skull and of some other bones in the\r\ndomesticated rabbit well deserves attention. It must not be supposed that\r\nthe more important differences immediately to be described strictly\r\ncharacterise any one breed; all that can be said is, that they are\r\ngenerally present in certain breeds. We should bear in mind that selection\r\nhas not been applied to fix any character in the skeleton, and that the\r\nanimals have not had to support themselves under {116} uniform habits of\r\nlife. We cannot account for most of the differences in the skeleton; but we\r\nshall see that the increased size of the body, due to careful nurture and\r\ncontinued selection, has affected the head in a particular manner. Even the\r\nelongation and lopping of the ears have influenced in a small degree the\r\nform of the whole skull. The want of exercise has apparently modified the\r\nproportional length of the limbs in comparison with the body.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Skull of Wild Rabbit, of natural size.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Skull of large Lop-eared Rabbit, of natural\r\n    size.]\r\n\r\n    As a standard of comparison, I prepared skeletons of two wild rabbits\r\n    from Kent, one from the Shetland Islands, and one from Antrim in\r\n    Ireland. As all the bones in these four specimens from such distant\r\n    localities closely resembled each other, presenting scarcely any\r\n    appreciable difference, it may be concluded that the bones of the wild\r\n    rabbit are generally uniform in character.\r\n\r\n    _Skull._--I have carefully examined skulls of ten large lop-eared fancy\r\n    rabbits, and of five common domestic rabbits, which latter differ from\r\n    the lop-eared only in not having such large bodies or ears, yet both\r\n    larger than in the wild rabbit. First for the ten lop-eared rabbits: in\r\n    all these the skull is remarkably elongated in comparison with its\r\n    breadth. In a wild rabbit the length was 3.15 inches, in a large fancy\r\n    rabbit 4.30; whilst the breadth of the cranium enclosing the brain was\r\n    in both almost exactly the same. Even by taking as the standard of\r\n    comparison the widest part of the zygomatic arch, the skulls of the\r\n    lop-eared are proportionally to their breadth three-quarters of an inch\r\n    too long. The depth of the head has increased almost in the same\r\n    proportion with the length; it is the breadth alone which has not\r\n    increased. The parietal and occipital bones enclosing the brain are\r\n    less arched, both in a longitudinal and transverse line, than in the\r\n    wild rabbit, so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat different.\r\n    The surface is rougher, less cleanly sculptured, and the lines of\r\n    sutures are more prominent.\r\n\r\n    Although the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits in comparison with\r\n    those of the wild rabbit are much elongated relatively to their\r\n    breadth, yet, relatively to the size of body, they are far from\r\n    elongated. The lop-eared rabbits which I examined were, though not fat,\r\n    more than twice as heavy as the wild specimens; but the skull was very\r\n    far from being twice as long. Even if we take the fairer standard of\r\n    the length of body, from the nose to the anus, the skull is not on an\r\n    average as long as it ought to be by a third of an inch. In the small\r\n    feral P. Santo rabbit, on the other hand, the head relatively to the\r\n    length of body is about a quarter of an inch too long.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Part of Zygomatic Arch, showing the projecting\r\n    end of the malar bone and the auditory meatus: of natural size. Upper\r\n    figure, Wild Rabbit. Lower figure, Lop-eared, hare-coloured Rabbit.]\r\n\r\n    This elongation of the skull relatively to its breadth, I find a\r\n    universal character, not only with the large lop-eared rabbits, but in\r\n    all the artificial breeds; as is well seen in the skull of the Angora.\r\n    I was at first much surprised at the fact, and could not imagine why\r\n    domestication should produce this uniform result; but the explanation\r\n    seems to lie in the circumstance that during a number of generations\r\n    the artificial races have been closely confined, and have had little\r\n    occasion to exert either their senses, or intellect, or voluntary\r\n    muscles; consequently the brain, as {117} we shall presently more fully\r\n    see, has not increased relatively with the size of body. As the brain\r\n    has not increased, the bony case enclosing it has not increased, and\r\n    this has evidently affected through correlation the breadth of the\r\n    entire skull from end to end.\r\n\r\n    In all the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits, the supra-orbital\r\n    plates or processes of the frontal bones ere much broader than in the\r\n    wild rabbit, and they generally project more upwards. In the zygomatic\r\n    arch the posterior or projecting point of the malar-bone is broader and\r\n    blunter; and in the specimen, fig. 8, it is so in a remarkable degree.\r\n    This point approaches nearer to the auditory meatus than in the wild\r\n    rabbit, as may be best seen in fig. 8; but this circumstance mainly\r\n    depends on the changed direction of the meatus. The inter-parietal bone\r\n    (see fig. 9) differs much in shape in the several skulls; generally it\r\n    is more oval, or has a greater width in the line of the longitudinal\r\n    axis of the skull, than in the wild rabbit. The {118} posterior margin\r\n    of \"the square raised platform\" [271] of the occiput, instead of being\r\n    truncated, or projecting slightly as in the wild rabbit, is in most\r\n    lop-eared rabbits pointed, as in fig. 9, C. The paramastoids relatively\r\n    to the size of the skull are generally much thicker than in the wild\r\n    rabbit.\r\n\r\n    The occipital foramen (fig. 10) presents some remarkable differences:\r\n    in the wild rabbit, the lower edge between the condyles is considerably\r\n    and almost angularly hollowed out, and the upper edge is deeply and\r\n    squarely notched; hence the longitudinal axis exceeds the transverse\r\n    axis. In the skulls of the lop-eared rabbits the transverse axis\r\n    exceeds the longitudinal; for in none of these skulls was the lower\r\n    edge between the condyles so deeply hollowed out; in five of them there\r\n    was no upper square notch, in three there was a trace of the notch, and\r\n    in two alone it was well developed. These differences in the shape of\r\n    the foramen are remarkable, considering that it gives passage to so\r\n    important a structure as the spinal marrow, though apparently the\r\n    outline of the latter is not affected by the shape of the passage.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Posterior end of Skull, of natural size,\r\n    showing the inter-parietal bone. A. Wild Rabbit. B. Feral Rabbit from\r\n    island of P. Santo, near Madeira. C. Large Lop-eared Rabbit.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Occipital Foramen, of natural size, in--A.\r\n    Wild Rabbit; B. Large Lop-eared Rabbit.]\r\n\r\n    In all the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits, the bony auditory\r\n    meatus is conspicuously larger than in the wild rabbit. In a skull 4.3\r\n    inches in length, and which barely exceeded in breadth the skull of a\r\n    wild rabbit (which was 3.15 inches in length), the longer diameter of\r\n    the meatus was exactly twice as great. The orifice is more compressed,\r\n    and its margin on the side nearest the skull stands up higher than the\r\n    outer side. The whole meatus is directed more forwards. As in breeding\r\n    lop-eared rabbits the length of the ears, and their consequent lopping\r\n    and lying flat on the face, are the chief points of excellence, there\r\n    can hardly be a doubt that the great change in the size, form, and\r\n    direction of the bony meatus, relatively to this same part in the wild\r\n    rabbit, is due to the continued selection of individuals having {119}\r\n    larger and larger ears. The influence of the external ear on the bony\r\n    meatus is well shown in the skulls (I have examined three) of half-lops\r\n    (see fig. 5), in which one ear stands upright, and the other and longer\r\n    ear hangs down; for in these skulls there was a plain difference in the\r\n    form and direction of the bony meatus on the two sides. But it is a\r\n    much more interesting fact, that the changed direction and increased\r\n    size of the bony meatus have slightly affected on the same side the\r\n    structure of the whole skull. I here give a drawing of the skull of a\r\n    half-lop; and it may be observed that the suture between the parietal\r\n    and frontal bones does not run strictly at right angles to the\r\n    longitudinal axis of the skull; the left frontal bone projects beyond\r\n    the right one; both the posterior and anterior margins of the left\r\n    zygomatic arch on the side of the lopping ear stand a little in advance\r\n    of the corresponding bones on the opposite side. Even the lower jaw is\r\n    affected, and the condyles are not quite symmetrical, that on the left\r\n    standing a little in advance of that on the right. This seems to me a\r\n    remarkable case of correlation of growth. Who would have surmised that\r\n    by keeping an animal during many generations under confinement, and so\r\n    leading to the disuse of the muscles of the ears, and by continually\r\n    selecting individuals with the longest and largest ears, he would thus\r\n    indirectly have affected almost every suture in the skull and the form\r\n    of the lower jaw!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Skull, of natural size, of Half-lop Rabbit,\r\n    showing the different direction of the auditory meatus on the two\r\n    sides, and the consequent general distortion of the skull. The left ear\r\n    of the animal (or right side of figure) lopped forwards.]\r\n\r\n    In the large lop-eared rabbits the only difference in the lower jaw, in\r\n    comparison with that of the wild rabbit, is that the posterior margin\r\n    of the ascending ramus is broader and more inflected. The teeth in\r\n    neither jaw present any difference, except that the small incisors,\r\n    beneath the large ones, are proportionally a little longer. The molar\r\n    teeth have increased in size proportionally with the increased width of\r\n    the skull, measured across the zygomatic arch, and not proportionally\r\n    with its increased length. The inner line of the sockets of the molar\r\n    teeth in the upper jaw of the wild rabbit forms a perfectly straight\r\n    line; but in {120} some of the largest skulls of the lop-eared this\r\n    line was plainly bowed inwards. In one specimen there was an additional\r\n    molar tooth on each side of the upper jaw, between the molars and\r\n    premolars; but these two teeth did not correspond in size; and as no\r\n    rodent has seven molars, this is merely a monstrosity, though a curious\r\n    one.\r\n\r\n    The five other skulls of common domestic rabbits, some of which\r\n    approach in size the above-described largest skulls, whilst the others\r\n    exceed but little those of the wild rabbit, are only worth notice as\r\n    presenting a perfect gradation in all the above-specified differences\r\n    between the skulls of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. In all,\r\n    however, the supra-orbital plates are rather larger, and in all the\r\n    auditory meatus is larger, in conformity with the increased size of the\r\n    external ears, than in the wild rabbit. The lower notch in the\r\n    occipital foramen in some was not so deep as in the wild, but in all\r\n    five skulls the upper notch was well developed.\r\n\r\n    The skull of the _Angora_ rabbit, like the latter five skulls, is\r\n    intermediate in general proportions, and in most other characters,\r\n    between those of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. It presents\r\n    only one singular character: though considerably longer than the skull\r\n    of the wild, the breadth measured within the posterior supra-orbital\r\n    fissures is nearly a third less than in the wild. The skulls of the\r\n    _silver-grey_, and _chinchilla_ and _Himalayan_ rabbits are more\r\n    elongated than in the wild, with broader supra-orbital plates, but\r\n    differ little in any other respect, excepting that the upper and lower\r\n    notches of the occipital foramen are not so deep or so well developed.\r\n    The skull of the _Moscow_ rabbit scarcely differs in any respect from\r\n    that of the wild rabbit. In the Porto Santo feral rabbits the\r\n    supra-orbital plates are generally narrower and more pointed than in\r\n    our wild rabbits.\r\n\r\n    As some of the largest lop-eared rabbits of which I prepared skeletons\r\n    were coloured almost like hares, and as these latter animals and\r\n    rabbits have, as it is affirmed, been recently crossed in France, it\r\n    might be thought that some of the above-described characters had been\r\n    derived from a cross at a remote period with the hare. Consequently I\r\n    examined skulls of the hare, but no light could thus be thrown on the\r\n    peculiarities of the skulls of the larger rabbits. It is, however, an\r\n    interesting fact, as illustrating the law that varieties of one species\r\n    often assume the characters of other species of the same genus, that I\r\n    found, on comparing the skulls of ten species of hares in the British\r\n    Museum, that they differed from each other chiefly in the very same\r\n    points in which domestic rabbits vary,--namely, in general proportions,\r\n    in the form and size of the supra-orbital plates, in the form of the\r\n    free end of the malar bone, and in the line of suture separating the\r\n    occipital and frontal bones. Moreover two eminently variable characters\r\n    in the domestic rabbit, namely, the outline of the occipital foramen\r\n    and the shape of the \"raised platform\" of the occiput, were likewise\r\n    variable in two instances in the same species of hare.\r\n\r\n    _Vertebræ._--The number is uniform in all the skeletons which I have\r\n    examined, with two exceptions, namely, in one of the small feral Porto\r\n    Santo rabbits and in one of the largest lop-eared kinds; both of these\r\n    had as usual seven cervical, twelve dorsal with ribs, but, instead of\r\n    seven lumbar, both had eight lumbar vertebræ. This is remarkable, as\r\n    Gervais gives {121} seven as the number for the whole genus Lepus. The\r\n    caudal vertebræ apparently differ by two or three, but I did not attend\r\n    to them, and they are difficult to count with certainty.\r\n\r\n    In the first cervical vertebra, or atlas, the anterior margin of the\r\n    neural arch varies a little in wild specimens, being either nearly\r\n    smooth, or furnished with a small supra-median atlantoid process; I\r\n    have figured a specimen with the largest process (_a_) which I have\r\n    seen; but it will be observed how inferior this is in size and\r\n    different in shape to that in a large lop-eared rabbit. In the latter,\r\n    the infra-median process (_b_) is also proportionally much thicker and\r\n    longer. The alæ are a little squarer in outline.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Atlas Vertebræ, of natural size; inferior\r\n    surface viewed obliquely. Upper figure, Wild Rabbit. Lower figure,\r\n    Hare-coloured, large, Lop-eared Rabbit. _a_, supra-median, atlantoid\r\n    process; _b_, infra-median process.]\r\n\r\n    _Third cervical vertebra._--In the wild rabbit (fig. 13, A _a_) this\r\n    vertebra, viewed on the inferior surface, has a transverse process,\r\n    which is directed obliquely backwards, and consists of a single pointed\r\n    bar; in the fourth vertebra this process is slightly forked in the\r\n    middle. In the large lop-eared rabbits this process (B _a_) is forked\r\n    in the third vertebra, as in the fourth of the wild rabbit. But the\r\n    third cervical vertebræ of the wild and lop-eared (A _b_, B _b_)\r\n    rabbits differ more conspicuously when their anterior articular\r\n    surfaces are compared; for the extremities of the antero-dorsal\r\n    processes in the wild rabbit are simply rounded, whilst in the\r\n    lop-eared they are trifid, with a deep central pit. The canal for the\r\n    spinal marrow in the lop-eared (B _b_) is more elongated in a\r\n    transverse direction than in the wild rabbit; and the passages for the\r\n    arteries are of a slightly different shape. These several differences\r\n    in this vertebra seem to me well deserving attention.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Third Cervical Vertebra, of natural size,\r\n    of--A. Wild Rabbit; B. Hare-coloured, large, Lop-eared Rabbit. _a, a_,\r\n    inferior surface; _b, b_, anterior articular surfaces.]\r\n\r\n    _First dorsal vertebra._--Its neural spine varies in length in the wild\r\n    rabbit; being sometimes very short, but generally more than half as\r\n    long as that of the second dorsal; but I have seen it in two large\r\n    lop-eared rabbits three-fourths of the length of that of the second\r\n    dorsal vertebra.\r\n\r\n    _Ninth and tenth dorsal vertebræ._--In the wild rabbit the neural spine\r\n    of the ninth vertebra is just perceptibly thicker than that of the\r\n    eighth; and {122} the neural spine of the tenth is plainly thicker and\r\n    shorter than those of all the anterior vertebræ. In the large lop-cared\r\n    rabbits the neural spines of the tenth, ninth, eighth, and even in a\r\n    slight degree that of the seventh vertebra, are very much thicker, and\r\n    of somewhat different shape, in comparison with those of the wild\r\n    rabbit. So that this part of the vertebral column differs considerably\r\n    in appearance from the same part in the wild rabbit, and closely\r\n    resembles in an interesting manner these same vertebræ in some species\r\n    of hares. In the Angora, Chinchilla, and Himalayan rabbits, the neural\r\n    spines of the eighth and ninth vertebræ are in a slight degree thicker\r\n    than in the wild. On the other hand, in one of the feral Porto Santo\r\n    rabbits, which in most of its characters deviates in an exactly\r\n    opposite manner to what the large lop-cared rabbits do from the common\r\n    wild rabbit, the neural spines of the ninth and tenth vertebræ were not\r\n    at all larger than those of the several anterior vertebræ. In this same\r\n    Porto Santo specimen there was no trace in the ninth vertebra of the\r\n    anterior lateral processes (see woodcut 14), which are plainly\r\n    developed in all British wild rabbits, and still more plainly developed\r\n    in the large lop-eared rabbits. In a half-wild rabbit from Sandon\r\n    Park,[272] a hæmal spine was moderately well developed on the under\r\n    side of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, and I have seen this in no other\r\n    specimen.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Dorsal Vertebræ, from sixth to tenth\r\n    inclusive, of natural size, viewed laterally. A. Wild Rabbit. B. Large,\r\n    Hare-coloured, so called Spanish Rabbit.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Terminal bone of Sternum, of natural size. A.\r\n    Wild Rabbit. B. Hare-coloured, Lop-eared Rabbit. C. Hare-coloured,\r\n    Spanish Rabbit. (N.B. The left-hand angle of the upper articular\r\n    extremity of B was broken, and has been accidentally thus\r\n    represented.)]\r\n\r\n    _Lumbar vertebræ._--I have stated that in two cases there were eight\r\n    instead of seven lumbar vertebræ. The third lumbar vertebra in one\r\n    skeleton of a wild British rabbit, and in one of the Porto Santo feral\r\n    rabbits, had a hæmal spine; whilst in four skeletons of large lop-eared\r\n    rabbits, and in the Himalayan rabbit, this same vertebra had a\r\n    well-developed hæmal spine.\r\n\r\n    _Pelvis._--In four wild specimens this bone was almost absolutely\r\n    identical in shape; but in several domesticated breeds shades of\r\n    differences {123} could be distinguished. In the large lop-eared\r\n    rabbits the whole upper part of the ilium is straighter, or less\r\n    splayed outwards, than in the wild rabbit; and the tuberosity on the\r\n    inner lip of the anterior and upper part of the ilium is proportionally\r\n    more prominent.\r\n\r\n    _Sternum._--The posterior end of the posterior sternal bone in the wild\r\n    rabbit (fig. 15, A) is thin and slightly enlarged; in some of the large\r\n    lop-eared rabbits (B) it is much more enlarged towards the extremity;\r\n    whilst in other specimens (C) it keeps nearly of the same breadth from\r\n    end to end, but is much thicker at the extremity.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Acromion of Scapula, of natural size. A. Wild\r\n    Rabbit. B, C, D; Large, Lop-eared Rabbits.]\r\n\r\n    _Scapula._--The acromion sends out a rectangular bar, ending in an\r\n    oblique knob, which latter in the wild rabbit (fig. 16, A) varies a\r\n    little in shape and size, as does the apex of the acromion in\r\n    sharpness, and the part just below the rectangular bar in breadth. But\r\n    the variations in these respects in the wild rabbit are very slight;\r\n    whilst in the large lop-eared rabbits they are considerable. Thus in\r\n    some specimens (B) the oblique terminal knob is developed into a short\r\n    bar, forming an obtuse angle with the rectangular bar. In another\r\n    specimen (C) these two unequal bars form nearly a straight line. The\r\n    apex of the acromion varies much in breadth and sharpness, as may be\r\n    seen by comparing figs. B, C, and D.\r\n\r\n    _Limbs._--In these I could detect no variation; but the bones of the\r\n    feet were too troublesome to compare with much care.\r\n\r\nI have now described all the differences in the skeletons which I have\r\nobserved. It is impossible not to be struck with the high degree of\r\nvariability or plasticity of many of the bones. We see how erroneous the\r\noften-repeated statement is, that only the crests of the bones which give\r\nattachment to muscles vary in shape, and that only parts of slight\r\nimportance {124} become modified under domestication. No one will say, for\r\ninstance, that the occipital foramen, or the atlas, or the third cervical\r\nvertebra is a part of slight importance. If the several vertebræ of the\r\nwild and lop-eared rabbits, of which figures have been given, had been\r\nfound fossil, palæontologists would have declared without hesitation that\r\nthey had belonged to distinct species.\r\n\r\n    _The effects of the use and disuse of parts._--In the large lop-eared\r\n    rabbits the relative proportional lengths of the bones of the same leg,\r\n    and of the front and hind legs compared with each other, have remained\r\n    nearly the same as in the wild rabbit; but in weight, the bones of the\r\n    hind legs apparently have not increased in due proportion with the\r\n    front legs. The weight of the whole body in the large rabbits examined\r\n    by me was from twice to twice and a half as great as that of the wild\r\n    rabbit; and the weight of the bones of the front and hind limbs taken\r\n    together (excluding the feet, on account of the difficulty of perfectly\r\n    cleaning so many small bones) has increased in the large lop-eared\r\n    rabbits in nearly the same proportion; consequently in due proportion\r\n    to the weight of body which they have to support. If we take the length\r\n    of the body as the standard of comparison, the limbs of the large\r\n    rabbits have not increased in length in due proportion by one inch, or\r\n    by one inch and a half. Again, if we take as the standard of comparison\r\n    the length of the skull, which, as we have before seen, has not\r\n    increased in length in due proportion to the length of body, the limbs\r\n    will be found to be, proportionally with those of the wild rabbit, from\r\n    half to three-quarters of an inch too short. Hence, whatever standard\r\n    of comparison be taken, the limb-bones of the large lop-eared rabbits\r\n    have not increased in length, though they have in weight, in full\r\n    proportion to the other parts of the frame; and this, I presume, may be\r\n    accounted for by the inactive life which during many generations they\r\n    have spent. Nor has the scapula increased in length in due proportion\r\n    to the increased length of the body.\r\n\r\n    The capacity of the osseous case of the brain is a more interesting\r\n    point, to which I was led to attend by finding, as previously stated,\r\n    that with all domesticated rabbits the length of the skull relatively\r\n    to its breadth has greatly increased in comparison with that of the\r\n    wild rabbit. If we had possessed a large number of domesticated rabbits\r\n    of nearly the same size with the wild rabbit, it would have been a\r\n    simple task to have measured and compared the capacities of their\r\n    skulls. But this is not the case; almost all the domestic breeds have\r\n    larger bodies than wild rabbits, and the lop-eared kinds are more than\r\n    double their weight. As a small animal has to exert its senses,\r\n    intellect, and instincts equally with a large animal, we ought not by\r\n    any means to expect an animal twice or thrice as large as another to\r\n    have a brain of double or treble the size.[273] Now, after weighing\r\n    {125} the bodies of four wild rabbits, and of four large but not\r\n    fattened lop-eared rabbits, I find that on an average the wild are to\r\n    the lop-eared in weight as 1 to 2.47; in average length of body as 1 to\r\n    1.41; whilst in capacity of skull (measured as hereafter to be\r\n    described) they are only as 1 to 1.15. Hence we see that the capacity\r\n    of the skull, and consequently the size of the brain, has increased but\r\n    little, relatively to the increased size of the body; and this fact\r\n    explains the narrowness of the skull relatively to its length in all\r\n    domestic rabbits.\r\n\r\n    In the upper half of the following table I have given the measurements\r\n    of the skulls of ten wild rabbits; and in the lower half of eleven\r\n    thoroughly domesticated kinds. As these rabbits differ so greatly in\r\n    size, it is necessary to have some standard by which to compare the\r\n    capacities of their skulls. I have selected the length of skull as the\r\n    best standard, for in the larger rabbits it has not, as already stated,\r\n    increased in length so much as the body; but as the skull, like every\r\n    other part, varies in length, neither it nor any other part affords a\r\n    perfect standard.\r\n\r\n    In the first column of figures the extreme length of the skull is given\r\n    in inches and decimals. I am aware that these measurements pretend to\r\n    greater accuracy than is possible; but I have found it the least\r\n    trouble to record the exact length which the compass gave. The second\r\n    and third columns give the length and weight of body, whenever these\r\n    measurements have been made. The fourth column gives the capacity of\r\n    the skull by the weight of small shot with which the skulls had been\r\n    filled; but it is not pretended that these weights are accurate within\r\n    a few grains. In the fifth column the capacity is given which the skull\r\n    ought to have had by calculation, according to the length of skull, in\r\n    comparison with that of the wild rabbit No. 1; in the sixth column the\r\n    difference between the actual and calculated capacities, and in the\r\n    seventh the percentage of increase or decrease, are given. For\r\n    instance, as the wild rabbit No. 5 has a shorter and lighter body than\r\n    the wild rabbit No. 1, we might have expected that its skull would have\r\n    had less capacity; the actual capacity, as expressed by the weight of\r\n    shot, is 875 grains, which is 97 grains less than that of the first\r\n    rabbit. But comparing these two rabbits by the length of their skulls,\r\n    we see that in No. 1 the skull is 3.15 inches in length, and in No. 5\r\n    2.96 inches in length; according to this ratio, the brain of No. 5\r\n    ought to have had a capacity of 913 grains of shot, which is above the\r\n    actual capacity, but only by 38 grains. Or, to put the case in another\r\n    way (as in column VII), the brain of this small rabbit, No. 5, for\r\n    every 100 grains of weight is only 4 per cent. too light,--that is, it\r\n    ought, according to the standard rabbit No. 1, to have been 4 per cent.\r\n    heavier. I have taken the rabbit No. 1 as the standard of comparison\r\n    because, of the skulls having a full average length, this has the least\r\n    capacity; so that it is the least favourable to the result which I wish\r\n    to show, namely, that the brain in all long-domesticated rabbits has\r\n    decreased in size, either actually, or relatively to the length of the\r\n    head and body, in comparison with the brain of the wild rabbit. Had I\r\n    taken the Irish rabbit, No. 3, as the standard, the following results\r\n    would have been somewhat more striking.\r\n\r\n    Turning to the Table: the first four wild rabbits have skulls of the\r\n    same length, and these differ but little in capacity. The Sandon rabbit\r\n    {126} (No. 4) is interesting, as, though now wild, it is known to be\r\n    descended from a domesticated breed, as is still shown by its peculiar\r\n    colouring and longer body; nevertheless the skull has recovered its\r\n    normal length and full capacity. The next three rabbits are wild, but\r\n    of small size, and they all have skulls with slightly lessened\r\n    capacities. The three Porto Santo feral rabbits (Nos. 8 to 10) offer a\r\n    perplexing case; their bodies are greatly reduced in size, as in a\r\n    lesser degree are their skulls in length and in actual capacity, in\r\n    comparison with the skulls of wild English rabbits. But when we compare\r\n    the capacities of the skull in the three Porto Santo rabbits, we\r\n    observe a surprising difference, which does not stand in any relation\r\n    to the slight difference in the length of their skulls, nor, as I\r\n    believe, to any difference in the size of their bodies; but I neglected\r\n    to weigh separately their bodies. I can hardly suppose that the\r\n    medullary matter of the brain in these three rabbits, living under\r\n    similar conditions, can differ as much as is indicated by the\r\n    proportional difference of capacity in their skulls; nor do I know\r\n    whether it is possible that one brain may contain considerably more\r\n    fluid than another. Hence I can throw no light on this case.\r\n\r\n    Looking to the lower half of the Table, which gives the measurements of\r\n    domesticated rabbits, we see that in all the capacity of the skull is\r\n    less, but in very various degrees, than might have been anticipated\r\n    according to the length of their skulls, relatively to that of the wild\r\n    rabbit No. 1. In line 22 the average measurements of seven large\r\n    lop-eared rabbits are given. Now the question arises, has the average\r\n    capacity of the skull in these seven large rabbits increased as much as\r\n    might have been expected from their greatly increased size of body. We\r\n    may endeavour to answer this question in two ways: in the upper half of\r\n    the Table we have measurements of the skulls of six small wild rabbits\r\n    (Nos. 5 to 10), and we find that on an average the skulls are in length\r\n    .18 of an inch shorter, and in capacity 91 grains less, than the\r\n    average length and capacity of the three first wild rabbits on the\r\n    list. The seven large lop-cared rabbits, on an average, have skulls\r\n    4.11 inches in length, and 1136 grains in capacity; so that these\r\n    skulls have increased in length more than five times as much as the\r\n    skulls of the six small wild rabbits have decreased in length; hence we\r\n    might have expected that the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits\r\n    would have increased in capacity five times as much as the skulls of\r\n    the six small rabbits have decreased in capacity; and this would have\r\n    given an average increased capacity of 455 grains, whilst the real\r\n    average increase is only 155 grains. Again, the large lop-eared rabbits\r\n    have bodies of nearly the same weight and size as the common hare, but\r\n    their heads are longer; consequently, if the lop-eared rabbits had been\r\n    wild, it might have been expected that their skulls would have had\r\n    nearly the same capacity as that of the skull of the hare. But this is\r\n    far from being the case; for the average capacity of the two\r\n    hare-skulls (Nos. 23, 24) is so much larger than the average capacity\r\n    of the seven lop-cared skulls, that the latter would have to be\r\n    increased 21 per cent. to come up to the standard of the hare.[274]\r\n\r\n{127}\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------+---------+-------------\r\n                                                  | I.      |   II.\r\n                                                  |         |\r\n                                                  |         | Length\r\n          Name of Breed.                          | Length  | of Body from\r\n    WILD AND SEMI-WILD RABBITS.                   | of      | Incisors to\r\n                                                  | Skull.  | Anus.\r\n  ------------------------------------------------+---------+-------------\r\n                                                  | inches. | inches.\r\n   1.

Now the Himalayan,\r\n    Moscow, and Angora rabbits (Nos. 11, 12, 13 of Table) are only a little\r\n    larger in body, and have skulls only a little longer, than the wild\r\n    animal, and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is less\r\n    than in the wild animal, and considerably less by calculation (column\r\n    7), according to the difference in the length of their skulls. The\r\n    narrowness of the brain-case in these three rabbits could be plainly\r\n    seen and proved by external measurement. The Chinchilla rabbit (No. 14)\r\n    is a considerably larger animal than the wild rabbit, yet the capacity\r\n    of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the wild rabbit. The Angora\r\n    rabbit, No. 13, offers the most remarkable case; this animal in its\r\n    pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the stamp of long\r\n    domesticity. It has a considerably longer head and body than the wild\r\n    rabbit, but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of even\r\n    the little wild Porto Santo rabbits. By the standard of the length of\r\n    skull the capacity (see column 7) is only half of what it ought to have\r\n    been! I kept this individual animal alive, and it was not unhealthy nor\r\n    idiotic. This case of the Angora rabbit so much surprised me, that I\r\n    repeated all the measurements and found them correct. I have also\r\n    compared the capacity of the skull of the Angora with that of the wild\r\n    rabbit by other standards, namely, by the length and weight of the\r\n    body, and by the weight of the limb-bones; but by all these standards\r\n    the brain appears to be much too small, though in a less degree when\r\n    the standard of the limb-bones was used; and this latter circumstance\r\n    may probably be accounted for by the Limbs of this anciently\r\n    domesticated breed having become much reduced in weight, from its\r\n    long-continued inactive life. Hence I infer that in the Angora breed,\r\n    which is said to differ from other breeds in being quieter and more\r\n    social, the capacity of the skull has really undergone a remarkable\r\n    amount of reduction.\r\n\r\nFrom the several facts above given,--namely, firstly, that the actual\r\ncapacity of the skull in the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora breeds, is less\r\nthan in the wild rabbit, though they are in all their dimensions rather\r\nlarger animals; secondly, that the capacity of the skull of the large\r\nlop-eared rabbits has not been increased in nearly the same ratio as the\r\ncapacity of the skull of the smaller wild rabbits has been decreased; and\r\nthirdly, that the capacity of the skull in these same large lop-eared\r\nrabbits is very inferior to that of the hare, an animal of nearly the same\r\n{129} size,--I conclude, notwithstanding the remarkable differences in\r\ncapacity in the skulls of the small P. Santo rabbits, and likewise in the\r\nlarge lop-eared kinds, that in all long-domesticated rabbits the brain has\r\neither by no means increased in due proportion with the increased length of\r\nthe head and increased size of the body, or that it has actually decreased\r\nin size, relatively to what would have occurred had these animals lived in\r\na state of nature. When we remember that rabbits, from having been\r\ndomesticated and closely confined during many generations, cannot have\r\nexerted their intellect, instincts, senses, and voluntary movements, either\r\nin escaping from various dangers or in searching for food, we may conclude\r\nthat their brains will have been feebly exercised, and consequently have\r\nsuffered in development. We thus see that the most important and\r\ncomplicated organ in the whole organization is subject to the law of\r\ndecrease in size from disuse.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us sum up the more important modifications which domestic\r\nrabbits have undergone, together with their causes as far as we can\r\nobscurely see them. By the supply of abundant and nutritious food, together\r\nwith little exercise, and by the continued selection of the heaviest\r\nindividuals, the weight of the larger breeds has been more than doubled.\r\nThe bones of the limbs have increased in weight (but the hind legs less\r\nthan the front legs), in due proportion with the increased weight of body;\r\nbut in length they have not increased in due proportion, and this may have\r\nbeen caused by the want of proper exercise. With the increased size of the\r\nbody the third cervical vertebra has assumed characters proper to the\r\nfourth cervical; and the eighth and ninth dorsal vertebræ have similarly\r\nassumed characters proper to the tenth and posterior vertebræ. The skull in\r\nthe larger breeds has increased in length, but not in due proportion with\r\nthe increased length of body; the brain has not duly increased in\r\ndimensions, or has even actually decreased, and consequently the bony case\r\nfor the brain has remained narrow, and by correlation has affected the\r\nbones of the face and the entire length of the skull. The skull has thus\r\nacquired its characteristic narrowness. From unknown causes the\r\nsupra-orbital processes of the frontal bones and the free end of the malar\r\nbones have increased in breadth; and in the larger breeds {130} the\r\noccipital foramen is generally much less deeply notched than in wild\r\nrabbits. Certain parts of the scapula and the terminal sternal bones have\r\nbecome highly variable in shape. The ears have been increased enormously in\r\nlength and breadth through continued selection; their weight, conjoined\r\nprobably with the disuse of their muscles, has caused them to lop\r\ndownwards; and this has affected the position and form of the bony auditory\r\nmeatus; and this again, by correlation, the position in a slight degree of\r\nalmost every bone in the upper part of the skull, and even the position of\r\nthe condyles of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{131}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n    ENUMERATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL BREEDS--INDIVIDUAL\r\n    VARIABILITY--VARIATIONS OF A REMARKABLE NATURE--OSTEOLOGICAL\r\n    CHARACTERS: SKULL, LOWER JAW, NUMBER OF VERTEBRÆ--CORRELATION OF\r\n    GROWTH: TONGUE WITH BEAK; EYELIDS AND NOSTRILS WITH WATTLED\r\n    SKIN--NUMBER OF WING-FEATHERS, AND LENGTH OF WING--COLOUR AND\r\n    DOWN--WEBBED AND FEATHERED FEET--ON THE EFFECTS OF DISUSE--LENGTH OF\r\n    FEET IN CORRELATION WITH LENGTH OF BEAK--LENGTH OP STERNUM, SCAPULA,\r\n    AND FURCULA--LENGTH OF WINGS--SUMMARY ON THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE IN\r\n    THE SEVERAL BREEDS\r\n\r\nI have been led to study domestic pigeons with particular care, because the\r\nevidence that all the domestic races have descended from one known source\r\nis far clearer than with any other anciently domesticated animal. Secondly,\r\nbecause many treatises in several languages, some of them old, have been\r\nwritten on the pigeon, so that we are enabled to trace the history of\r\nseveral breeds. And lastly, because, from causes which we can partly\r\nunderstand, the amount of variation has been extraordinarily great. The\r\ndetails will often be tediously minute; but no one who really wants to\r\nunderstand the progress of change in domestic animals will regret this; and\r\nno one who has kept pigeons and has marked the great difference between the\r\nbreeds and the trueness with which most of them propagate their kind, will\r\nthink this care superfluous. Notwithstanding the clear evidence that all\r\nthe breeds are the descendants of a single species, I could not persuade\r\nmyself until some years had passed that the whole amount of difference\r\nbetween them had arisen since man first domesticated the wild rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nI have kept alive all the most distinct breeds, which I could procure in\r\nEngland or from the Continent; and have prepared skeletons of all. I have\r\nreceived skins from Persia, and a large number from India and other\r\nquarters of the {132} world.[275] Since my admission into two of the London\r\npigeon-clubs, I have received the kindest assistance from many of the most\r\neminent amateurs.[276]\r\n\r\nThe races of the Pigeon which can be distinguished, and which breed true,\r\nare very numerous. MM. Boitard and Corbié[277] describe in detail 122\r\nkinds; and I could add several European kinds not known to them. In India,\r\njudging from the skins sent me, there are many breeds unknown here; and Sir\r\nW. Elliot informs me that a collection imported by an Indian merchant into\r\nMadras from Cairo and Constantinople included several kinds unknown in\r\nIndia. I have no doubt that there exist considerably above 150 kinds which\r\nbreed true and have been separately named. But of these the far greater\r\nnumber differ from each other only in unimportant characters. Such\r\ndifferences will be here entirely passed over, and I shall confine myself\r\nto the more important points of structure. That many important differences\r\nexist we shall presently see. I have looked through the magnificent\r\ncollection of the Columbidæ in the British Museum, and, with the exception\r\nof a few forms (such as the Didunculus, Calænas, Goura, &c), I do not\r\nhesitate to {133} affirm that some domestic races of the rock-pigeon differ\r\nfully as much from each other in external characters as do the most\r\ndistinct natural genera. We may look in vain through the 288 known\r\nspecies[278] for a beak so small and conical as that of the short-faced\r\ntumbler; for one so broad and short as that of the barb; for one so long,\r\nstraight, and narrow, with its enormous wattles, as that of the English\r\ncarrier; for an expanded upraised tail like that of the fantail; or for an\r\noesophagus like that of the pouter. I do not for a moment pretend that the\r\ndomestic races differ from each other in their whole organisation as much\r\nas the more distinct natural genera. I refer only to external characters,\r\non which, however, it must be confessed that most genera of birds have been\r\nfounded. When, in a future chapter, we discuss the principle of selection\r\nas followed by man, we shall clearly see why the differences between the\r\ndomestic races are almost always confined to external, or at least to\r\nexternally visible, characters.\r\n\r\nOwing to the amount and gradations of difference between the several\r\nbreeds, I have found it indispensable in the following classification to\r\nrank them under Groups, Races, and Sub-races; to which varieties and\r\nsub-varieties, all strictly inheriting their proper characters, must often\r\nbe added. Even with the individuals of the same sub-variety, when long kept\r\nby different fanciers, different strains can sometimes be recognised. There\r\ncan be no doubt that, if well-characterized forms of the several Races had\r\nbeen found wild, all would have been ranked as distinct species, and\r\nseveral of them would certainly have been placed by ornithologists in\r\ndistinct genera. A good classification of the various domestic breeds is\r\nextremely difficult, owing to the manner in which many of the forms\r\ngraduate into each other; but it is curious how exactly the same\r\ndifficulties are encountered, and the same rules have to be followed, as in\r\nthe classification of any natural but difficult group of organic beings. An\r\n\"artificial classification\" might be followed which would present fewer\r\ndifficulties than a \"natural classification;\" but then it would interrupt\r\nmany plain affinities. Extreme forms can readily be defined; but\r\nintermediate and troublesome forms {134} often destroy our definitions.\r\nForms which may be called \"aberrant\" must sometimes be included within\r\ngroups to which they do not accurately belong. Characters of all kinds must\r\nbe used; but as with birds in a state of nature, those afforded by the beak\r\nare the best and most readily appreciated. It is not possible to weigh the\r\nimportance of all the characters which have to be used so as to make the\r\ngroups and sub-groups of equal value. Lastly, a group may contain only one\r\nrace, and another and less distinctly defined group may contain several\r\nraces and sub-races, and in this case it is difficult, as in the\r\nclassification of natural species, to avoid placing too high a value on\r\ncharacters which are common to a large number of forms.\r\n\r\nIn my measurements I have never trusted to the eye; and when speaking of a\r\npart being large or small, I always refer to the wild rock-pigeon (_Columba\r\nlivia_) as the standard of comparison. The measurements are given in\r\ndecimals of an inch.[279]\r\n\r\nI will now give a brief description of all the principal breeds. The\r\nfollowing diagram may aid the reader in learning their names and seeing\r\ntheir affinities. The rock-pigeon, or _Columba livia_ (including under this\r\nname two or three closely-allied sub-species or geographical races,\r\nhereafter to be described), may be confidently viewed, as we shall see in\r\nthe next chapter, as the common parent-form. The names in italics on the\r\nright-hand side of the table show us the most distinct breeds, or those\r\nwhich have undergone the greatest amount of modification. The lengths of\r\nthe dotted lines rudely represent the degree of distinctness of each breed\r\nfrom the parent-stock, and the names {135} placed under each other in the\r\ncolumns show the more or less closely connecting links. The distances of\r\nthe dotted lines from each other approximately represent the amount of\r\ndifference between the several breeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--The Rock-pigeon, or Columba livia.[280] The\r\nparent-form of all domesticated Pigeons.]\r\n\r\n{136}\r\n\r\nCOLUMBA LIVIA or ROCK-PIGEON\r\n\r\n  GROUP I.

If the most\r\nstrongly marked sub-race be taken, namely, the Improved English Pouter,\r\nthis is perhaps the most distinct of all domesticated pigeons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--English Pouter.]\r\n\r\nRACE I.--POUTER PIGEONS. (Kropf-tauben, German. Grosses-gorges, or boulans,\r\nFrench.)\r\n\r\n_Oesophagus of great size, barely separated from the crop, often inflated.\r\nBody and legs elongated. Beak of moderate dimensions._ {138}\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race I._--The improved English Pouter, when its crop is fully\r\n    inflated, presents a truly astonishing appearance. The habit of\r\n    slightly inflating the crop is common to all domestic pigeons, but is\r\n    carried to an extreme in the Pouter. The crop does not differ, except\r\n    in size, from that of other pigeons; but is less plainly separated by\r\n    an oblique construction from the oesophagus. The diameter of the upper\r\n    part of the oesophagus is immense, even close up to the head. The beak\r\n    in one bird which I possessed was almost completely buried when the\r\n    oesophagus was fully expanded. The males, especially when excited, pout\r\n    more than the females, and they glory in exercising this power. If a\r\n    bird will not, to use the technical expression, \"play,\" the fancier, as\r\n    I have witnessed, by taking the beak into his mouth, blows him up like\r\n    a balloon; and the bird, then puffed up with wind and pride, struts\r\n    about, retaining his magnificent size as long as he can. Pouters often\r\n    take flight with their crops inflated; and after one of my birds had\r\n    swallowed a good meal of peas and water, as he flew up in order to\r\n    disgorge them and thus feed his nearly fledged young, I have heard the\r\n    peas rattling in his inflated crop as if in a bladder. When flying,\r\n    they often strike the backs of their wings together, and thus make a\r\n    clapping noise.\r\n\r\n    Pouters stand remarkably upright, and their bodies are thin and\r\n    elongated. In connexion with this form of body, the ribs are generally\r\n    broader and the vertebræ more numerous than in other breeds. From their\r\n    manner of standing their legs appear longer than they really are,\r\n    though, in proportion with those of _C. livia_, the legs and feet are\r\n    actually longer. The wings appear much elongated, but by measurement,\r\n    in relation to the length of body, this is not the case. The beak\r\n    likewise appears longer, but it is in fact a little shorter (about .03\r\n    of an inch), proportionally with the size of the body, and relatively\r\n    to the beak of the rock-pigeon. The Pouter, though not bulky, is a\r\n    large bird; I measured one which was 34½ inches from tip to tip of\r\n    wing, and 19 inches from tip of beak to end of tail. In a wild\r\n    rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands the same measurements gave only\r\n    28¼ and 14¾. There are many sub-varieties of the Pouter of different\r\n    colours, but these I pass over.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race II. Dutch Pouter._--This seems to be the parent-form of our\r\n    improved English Pouters. I kept a pair, but I suspect that they were\r\n    not pure birds. They are smaller than English pouters, and less well\r\n    developed in all their characters. Neumeister[281] says that the wings\r\n    are crossed over the tail, and do not reach to its extremity.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. The Lille Pouter_--I know this breed only from\r\n    description.[282] It approaches in general form the Dutch Pouter, but\r\n    the inflated oesophagus assumes a spherical form, as if the pigeon had\r\n    swallowed a large orange, which had stuck close under the beak. This\r\n    inflated ball is represented as rising to a level with the crown of the\r\n    head. The middle toe alone is feathered. A variety of this sub-race,\r\n    called the claquant, is described by MM. Boitard and Corbié; it pouts\r\n    but little, and is characterised {139} by the habit of violently\r\n    hitting its wings together over its back,--a habit which the English\r\n    Pouter has in a slight degree.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race IV. Common German Pouter._--I know this bird only from the\r\n    figures and description given by the accurate Neumeister, one of the\r\n    few writers on pigeons who, as I have found, may be always trusted.\r\n    This sub-race seems considerably different. The upper part of the\r\n    oesophagus is much less distended. The bird stands less upright. The\r\n    feet are not feathered, and the legs and beak are shorter. In these\r\n    respects there is an approach in form to the common rock-pigeon. The\r\n    tail-feathers are very long, yet the tips of the closed wings extend\r\n    beyond the end of the tail; and the length of the wings, from tip to\r\n    tip, and of the body, is greater than in the English Pouter.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.\r\n\r\nThis group includes three Races, namely, Carriers, Runts, and Barbs, which\r\nare manifestly allied to each other. Indeed, certain carriers and runts\r\npass into each other by such insensible gradations that an arbitrary line\r\nhas to be drawn between them. Carriers also graduate through foreign breeds\r\ninto the rock-pigeon. Yet, if well-characterised Carriers and Barbs (see\r\nfigs. 19 and 20) had existed as wild species, no ornithologist would have\r\nplaced them in the same genus with each other or with the rock-pigeon. This\r\ngroup may, as a general rule, be recognised by the beak being long, with\r\nthe skin over the nostrils swollen and often carunculated or wattled, and\r\nwith that round the eyes bare and likewise carunculated. The mouth is very\r\nwide, and the feet are large. Nevertheless the Barb, which must be classed\r\nin this same group, has a very short beak, and some runts have very little\r\nbare skin round their eyes.\r\n\r\nRACE II.--CARRIERS. (Türkische Taube: Pigeons Turcs: Dragons.)\r\n\r\n_Beak elongated, narrow, pointed; eyes surrounded by much naked, generally\r\ncarunculated skin; neck and body elongated._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--English Carrier.]\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race I. The English Carrier._--This is a fine bird, of large size,\r\n    close feathered, generally dark-coloured, with an elongated neck. The\r\n    beak is attenuated and of wonderful length: in one specimen it was 1.4\r\n    inch in length from the feathered base to the tip; therefore nearly\r\n    twice as long as that of the rock-pigeon, which measured only .77.\r\n    Whenever I compare proportionally any part in the carrier and\r\n    rock-pigeon, I take the length of the body from the base of the beak to\r\n    the end of the tail as the standard of comparison; and according to\r\n    this standard, the beak in one {140} Carrier was nearly half an inch\r\n    longer than in the rock-pigeon. The upper mandible is often slightly\r\n    arched. The tongue is very long. The development of the carunculated\r\n    skin or wattle round the eyes, over the nostrils, and on the lower\r\n    mandible, is prodigious. The eyelids, measured longitudinally, were in\r\n    some specimens exactly twice as long as in the rock-pigeon. The\r\n    external orifice or furrow of the nostrils was also twice as long. The\r\n    open mouth in its widest part was in one case .75 of an inch in width,\r\n    whereas in the rock-pigeon it is only about .4 of an inch. This great\r\n    width of mouth is shown in the skeleton by the reflexed edges of the\r\n    ramus of the lower jaw. The head is flat on the summit and narrow\r\n    between the orbits. The feet are large and coarse; the length, as {141}\r\n    measured from end of hind toe to end of middle toe (without the claws),\r\n    was in two specimens 2.6 inches; and this, proportionally with the\r\n    rock-pigeon, is an excess of nearly a quarter of an inch. One very fine\r\n    Carrier measured 31½ inches from tip to tip of wing. Birds of this\r\n    sub-race are too valuable to be flown as carriers.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race II. Dragons; Persian Carriers._--The English Dragon differs\r\n    from the improved English Carrier in being smaller in all its\r\n    dimensions, and in having less wattle round the eyes and over the\r\n    nostrils, and none on the lower mandible. Sir W. Elliot sent me from\r\n    Madras a Bagdad Carrier (sometimes called khandési), the name of which\r\n    shows its Persian origin; it would be considered here a very poor\r\n    Dragon; the body was of the size of the rock-pigeon, with the beak a\r\n    little longer, namely, 1 inch from the tip to the feathered base. The\r\n    skin round the eyes was only slightly wattled, whilst that over the\r\n    nostrils was fairly wattled. The Hon. C. Murray, also, sent me two\r\n    Carriers direct from Persia; these had nearly the same character as the\r\n    Madras bird, being about as large as the rock-pigeon, but the beak in\r\n    one specimen was as much as 1.15 in length; the skin over the nostrils\r\n    was only moderately, and that round the eyes scarcely at all wattled.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. Bagadotten-Tauben of Neumeister_ (Pavdotten or\r\n    Hocker-Tauben).--I owe to the kindness of Mr. Baily, jun., a dead\r\n    specimen of this singular breed imported from Germany. It is certainly\r\n    allied to the Runts; nevertheless, from its close affinity with\r\n    Carriers, it will be convenient here to describe it. The beak is long,\r\n    and is hooked or bowed downwards in a highly remarkable manner, as will\r\n    be seen in the woodcut to be hereafter given when I treat of the\r\n    skeleton. The eyes are surrounded by a wide space of bright red skin,\r\n    which, as well as that over the nostrils, is moderately wattled. The\r\n    breast-bone is remarkably protuberant, being abruptly bowed outwards.\r\n    The feet and tarsi are of great length, larger than in first-rate\r\n    English Carriers. The whole bird is of large size, but in proportion to\r\n    the size of the body the feathers of the wing and tail are short; a\r\n    wild rock-pigeon, of considerably less size, had tail-feathers 4.6\r\n    inches in length, whereas in the large Bagadotten these feathers were\r\n    scarcely over 4.1 inches in length. Riedel[283] remarks that it is a\r\n    very silent bird.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race IV. Bussorah Carrier._--Two specimens were sent me by Sir W.\r\n    Elliot from Madras, one in spirits and the other skinned. The name\r\n    shows its Persian origin. It is much valued in India, and is considered\r\n    as a distinct breed from the Bagdad Carrier, which forms my second\r\n    sub-race. At first I suspected that these two sub-races might have been\r\n    recently formed by crosses with other breeds, though the estimation in\r\n    which they are held renders this improbable; but in a Persian\r\n    treatise,[284] believed to have been written about 100 years ago, the\r\n    Bagdad and Bussorah breeds are described as distinct. The Bussorah\r\n    Carrier is of about the same size with the wild rock-pigeon. The shape\r\n    of the beak, with some little carunculated skin over the nostrils,--the\r\n    much elongated eyelids,--the {142} broad mouth measured\r\n    internally,--the narrow head,--the feet proportionally a little longer\r\n    than in the rock-pigeon,--and the general appearance, all show that\r\n    this bird is an undoubted Carrier; yet in one specimen the beak was of\r\n    exactly the same length as in the rock-pigeon. In the other specimen\r\n    the beak (as well as the opening of the nostrils) was only a very\r\n    little longer, viz. by .08 of an inch. Although there was a\r\n    considerable space of bare and slightly carunculated skin round the\r\n    eyes, that over the nostrils was only in a slight degree rugose. Sir W.\r\n    Elliot informs me that in the living bird the eye seems remarkably\r\n    large and prominent, and the same fact is noticed in the Persian\r\n    treatise; but the bony orbit is barely larger than that in the\r\n    rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n    Amongst the several breeds sent to me from Madras by Sir W. Elliot\r\n    there is a pair of the _Kala Par_, black birds with the beak slightly\r\n    elongated, with the skin over the nostrils rather full, and with a\r\n    little naked skin round the eyes. This breed seems more closely allied\r\n    to the Carrier than to any other breed, being nearly intermediate\r\n    between the Bussorah Carrier and the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n    The names applied in different parts of Europe and in India to the\r\n    several kinds of Carriers all point to Persia or the surrounding\r\n    countries as the source of this Race. And it deserves especial notice\r\n    that, even if we neglect the Kala Par as of doubtful origin, we get a\r\n    series broken by very small steps, from the rock-pigeon, through the\r\n    Bussorah, which sometimes has a beak not at all longer than that of the\r\n    rock-pigeon and with the naked skin round the eyes and over the\r\n    nostrils very slightly swollen and carunculated, through the Bagdad\r\n    sub-race and Dragons, to our improved English Carriers, which present\r\n    so marvellous a difference from the rock-pigeon or _Columba livia_.\r\n\r\nRACE III.--RUNTS. (Scanderoons: Die Florentiner-Taube and Hinkel-Taube of\r\nNeumeister: Pigeon Bagadais, Pigeon Romain.)\r\n\r\n_Beak long, massive; body of great size._\r\n\r\n    Inextricable confusion reigns in the classification, affinities, and\r\n    naming of Runts. Several characters which are generally pretty constant\r\n    in other pigeons, such as the length of the wings, tail, legs, and\r\n    neck, and the amount of naked skin round the eyes, are excessively\r\n    variable in Runts. When the naked skin over the nostrils and round the\r\n    eyes is considerably developed and wattled, and when the size of body\r\n    is not very great, Runts graduate in so insensible a manner into\r\n    Carriers, that the distinction is quite arbitrary. This fact is\r\n    likewise shown by the names given to them in different parts of Europe.\r\n    Nevertheless, taking the most distinct forms, at least five sub-races\r\n    (some of them including well-marked varieties) can be distinguished,\r\n    which differ in such important points of structure, that they would be\r\n    considered as good species in a state of nature.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race I. Scanderoon of English writers_ (Die Florentiner and\r\n    Hinkel-Taube of Neumeister).--Birds of this sub-race, of which I kept\r\n    one alive {143} and have since seen two others, differ from the\r\n    Bagadotten of Neumeister only in not haying the beak nearly so much\r\n    curved downwards, and in the naked skin round the eyes and over the\r\n    nostrils being hardly at all wattled. Nevertheless I have felt myself\r\n    compelled to place the Bagadotten in Race II., or that of the Carriers,\r\n    and the present bird in Race III., or that of the Runts. The Scanderoon\r\n    has a very short, narrow, and elevated tail; wings extremely short, so\r\n    that the first primary feathers were not longer than those of a small\r\n    tumbler pigeon! Neck long, much bowed; breast-bone prominent. Beak\r\n    long, being 1.15 inch from tip to feathered base; vertically thick;\r\n    slightly curved downwards. The skin over the nostrils swollen, not\r\n    wattled; naked skin round the eyes, broad, slightly carunculated. Legs\r\n    long; feet very large. Skin of neck bright red, often showing a naked\r\n    medial line, with a naked red patch at the distant end of the radius of\r\n    the wing. My bird, as measured from the base of the beak to the root of\r\n    the tail, was fully 2 inches longer than the rock-pigeon; yet the tail\r\n    itself was only 4 inches in length, whereas in the rock-pigeon, which\r\n    is a much smaller bird, the tail is 4-5/8 inches in length.\r\n\r\n    The Hinkel or Florentiner-Taube of Neumeister (Table XIII., fig. 1)\r\n    agrees with the above description in all the specified characters (for\r\n    the beak is not mentioned), except that Neumeister expressly says that\r\n    the neck is short, whereas in my Scanderoon it was remarkably long and\r\n    bowed; so that the Hinkel forms a well-marked variety.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race II. Pigeon Cygne and Pigeon Bagadais of Boitard and Corbié_\r\n    (Scanderoon of French writers).--I kept two of these birds alive,\r\n    imported from France. They differed from the first sub-race or true\r\n    Scanderoon in the much greater length of the wing and tail, in the beak\r\n    not being so long, and in the skin about the head being more\r\n    carunculated. The skin of the neck is red; but the naked patches on the\r\n    wings are absent. One of my birds measured 38½ inches from tip to tip\r\n    of wing. By taking the length of the body as the standard of\r\n    comparison, the two wings were no loss than 5 inches longer than those\r\n    of the rock-pigeon! The tail was 6¼ inches in length, and therefore 2¼\r\n    inches longer than that of the Scanderoon,--a bird of nearly the same\r\n    size. The beak is longer, thicker, and broader than in the rock-pigeon,\r\n    proportionally with the size of body. The eyelids, nostrils, and\r\n    internal gape of mouth are all proportionally very large, as in\r\n    Carriers. The foot, from the end of the middle to end of hind toe, was\r\n    actually 2.85 inches in length, which is an excess of .32 of an inch\r\n    over the foot of the rock-pigeon, relatively to the size of the two\r\n    birds.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. Spanish and Roman Runts_.--I am not sure that I am right\r\n    in placing these Runts in a distinct sub-race; yet, if we take\r\n    well-characterized birds, there can be no doubt of the propriety of the\r\n    separation. They are heavy, massive birds, with shorter necks, legs,\r\n    and beaks than in the foregoing races. The skin over the nostrils is\r\n    swollen, but not carunculated; the naked skin round the eyes is not\r\n    very wide, and only slightly carunculated; and I have seen a fine\r\n    so-called Spanish Runt with hardly any naked skin round the eyes. Of\r\n    the two varieties to be seen in England, one, which is the rarer, has\r\n    very long wings and tail, {144} and agrees pretty closely with the last\r\n    sub-race; the other, with shorter wings and tail, is apparently the\r\n    _Pigeon Romain ordinaire_ of Boitard and Corbié. These Runts are apt to\r\n    tremble like Fantails. They are bad flyers. A few years ago Mr.\r\n    Gulliver[285] exhibited a Runt which weighed 1 lb. 14 oz.; and, as I am\r\n    informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, two Runts from the south of France were\r\n    lately exhibited at the Crystal Palace, each of which weighed 2 lbs. 2½\r\n    oz. A very fine rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands weighed only 14½\r\n    oz.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race IV. Tronfo of Aldrovandi_ (Leghorn Runt?).--In Aldrovandi's\r\n    work published in 1600 there is a coarse woodcut of a great Italian\r\n    pigeon, with an elevated tail, short legs, massive body, and with the\r\n    beak short and thick. I had imagined that this latter character, so\r\n    abnormal in the group, was merely a false representation from bad\r\n    drawing; but Moore, in his work published in 1735, says that he\r\n    possessed a Leghorn Runt of which \"the beak was very short for so large\r\n    a bird.\" In other respects Moore's bird resembled the first sub-race or\r\n    Scanderoon, for it had a long bowed neck, long legs, short beak, and\r\n    elevated tail, and not much wattle about the head. So that Aldrovandi's\r\n    and Moore's birds must have formed distinct varieties, both of which\r\n    seem to be now extinct in Europe. Sir W. Elliot, however, informs me\r\n    that he has seen in Madras a short-beaked Runt imported from Cairo.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race V. Murassa (adorned Pigeon) of Madras._--Skins of these\r\n    handsome chequered birds were sent me from Madras by Sir W. Elliot.\r\n    They are rather larger than the largest rock-pigeon, with longer and\r\n    more massive beaks. The skin over the nostrils is rather full and very\r\n    slightly carunculated, and they have some naked skin round the eyes:\r\n    feet large. This breed is intermediate between the rock-pigeon and a\r\n    very poor variety of Runt or Carrier.\r\n\r\n    From these several descriptions we see that with Runts, as with\r\n    Carriers, we have a fine gradation from the rock-pigeon (with the\r\n    Tronfo diverging as a distinct branch) to our largest and most massive\r\n    Runts. But the chain of affinities, and many points of resemblance,\r\n    between Runts and Carriers, make me believe that these two races have\r\n    not descended by independent lines from the rock-pigeon, but from some\r\n    common parent, as represented in the Table, which had already acquired\r\n    a moderately long beak, with slightly swollen skin over the nostrils,\r\n    and with some slightly carunculated naked skin round the eyes.\r\n\r\nRACE IV.--BARBS. (Indische-Taube: Pigeons Polonais.)\r\n\r\n_Beak short, broad, deep; naked skin round the eyes, broad and\r\ncarunculated; skin over nostrils slightly swollen._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--English Barb.]\r\n\r\n    Misled by the extraordinary shortness and form of the beak, I did not\r\n    at first perceive the near affinity of this Race to that of Carriers\r\n    until the fact was pointed out to me by Mr. Brent. Subsequently, after\r\n    examining {145} the Bussorah Carrier, I saw that no very great amount\r\n    of modification would be requisite to convert it into a Barb. This view\r\n    of the affinity of Barbs to Carriers is supported by the analogical\r\n    difference between the short and long-beaked Runts; and still more\r\n    strongly by the fact, that young Barbs and Dragons, within 24 hours\r\n    after being hatched, resemble each other much more closely than do\r\n    young pigeons of other and equally distinct breeds. At this early age,\r\n    the length of beak, the swollen skin over the rather open nostrils, the\r\n    gape of the mouth, and the size of the feet, are the same in both;\r\n    although these parts afterwards become widely different. We thus see\r\n    that embryology (as the comparison of very young animals {146} may\r\n    perhaps be called) comes into play in the classification of domestic\r\n    varieties, as with species in a state of nature.\r\n\r\n    Fanciers, with some truth, compare the head and beak of the Barb to\r\n    that of a bullfinch. The Barb, if found in a state of nature, would\r\n    certainly have been placed in a new genus formed for its reception. The\r\n    body is a little larger than that of the rock-pigeon, but the beak is\r\n    more than .2 of an inch shorter; although shorter, it is both\r\n    vertically and horizontally thicker. From the outward flexure of the\r\n    rami of the lower jaw, the mouth internally is very broad, in the\r\n    proportion of .6 to .4 to that of the rock-pigeon. The whole head is\r\n    broad. The skin over the nostrils is swollen, but not carunculated,\r\n    except slightly in first-rate birds when old; whilst the naked skin\r\n    round the eye is broad and much carunculated. It is sometimes so much\r\n    developed, that a bird belonging to Mr. Harrison Weir could hardly see\r\n    to pick up food from the ground. The eyelids in one specimen were\r\n    nearly twice as long as those of the rock-pigeon. The feet are coarse\r\n    and strong, but proportionally rather shorter than in the rock-pigeon.\r\n    The plumage is generally dark and uniform. Barbs, in short, may be\r\n    called short-beaked Carriers, bearing the same relation to Carriers\r\n    that the Tronfo of Aldrovandi does to the common Runt.\r\n\r\nGROUP III.\r\n\r\nThis group is artificial, and includes a heterogeneous collection of\r\ndistinct forms. It may be defined by the beak, in well-characterised\r\nspecimens of the several races, being shorter than in the rock-pigeon, and\r\nby the skin round the eyes not being much developed.\r\n\r\nRACE V.--FANTAILS.\r\n\r\n_Sub-race I. European Fantails_ (Pfauen-Taube; Trembleurs). _Tail expanded,\r\ndirected upwards, formed of many feathers; oil-gland aborted; body and beak\r\nrather short_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--English Fantail.]\r\n\r\n    The normal number of tail-feathers in the genus Columba is 12; but\r\n    Fantails have from only 12 (as has been asserted) up to, according to\r\n    MM. Boitard and Corbié, 42. I have counted in one of my own birds 33,\r\n    and at Calcutta Mr. Blyth[286] has counted in an _imperfect_ tail 34\r\n    feathers. In Madras, as I am informed by Sir W. Elliot, 32 is the\r\n    standard number; but in England number is much less valued than the\r\n    position and expansion of the tail. The feathers are arranged in an\r\n    irregular double row; their permanent expansion, like a fan, and their\r\n    upward direction, are more remarkable characters than their increased\r\n    number. The tail is capable of the same movements as in other pigeons,\r\n    and can be depressed so as to sweep the ground. It arises from a more\r\n    expanded basis than in {147} other pigeons; and in three skeletons\r\n    there were one or two extra coccygeal vertebræ. I have examined many\r\n    specimens of various colours from different countries, and there was no\r\n    trace of the oil-gland; this is a curious case of abortion.[287] The\r\n    neck is thin and bowed {148} backwards. The breast is broad and\r\n    protuberant. The feet are small. The carriage of the bird is very\r\n    different from that of other pigeons; in good birds the head touches\r\n    the tail-feathers, which consequently often become crumpled. They\r\n    habitually tremble much; and their necks have an extraordinary,\r\n    apparently convulsive, backward and forward movement. Good birds walk\r\n    in a singular manner, as if their small feet were stiff. Owing to their\r\n    large tails, they fly badly on a windy day. The dark-coloured varieties\r\n    are generally larger than white Fantails.\r\n\r\n    Although between the best and common Fantails, now existing in England,\r\n    there is a vast difference in the position and size of the tail, in the\r\n    carriage of the head and neck, in the convulsive movements of the neck,\r\n    in the manner of walking, and in the breadth of the breast, the\r\n    differences so graduate away, that it is impossible to make more than\r\n    one sub-race. Moore, however, an excellent old authority,[288] says,\r\n    that in 1735 there were two sorts of broad-tailed shakers (_i.e._\r\n    fantails), \"one having a neck much longer and more slender than the\r\n    other;\" and I am informed by Mr. B. P. Brent that there is an existing\r\n    German Fantail with a thicker and shorter beak.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race II. Java Fantail._--Mr. Swinhoe sent me from Amoy, in China,\r\n    the skin of a Fantail belonging to a breed known to have been imported\r\n    from Java. It was coloured in a peculiar manner, unlike any European\r\n    Fantail, and, for a Fantail, had a remarkably short beak. Although a\r\n    good bird of the kind, it had only 14 tail-feathers; but Mr. Swinhoe\r\n    has counted in other birds of this breed from 18 to 24 tail-feathers.\r\n    From a rough sketch sent to me, it is evident that the tail is not so\r\n    much expanded or so much upraised as in even second-rate European\r\n    Fantails. The bird shakes its neck like our Fantails. It had a\r\n    well-developed oil-gland. Fantails were known in India, as we shall\r\n    hereafter see, before the year 1600; and we may suspect that in the\r\n    Java Fantail we see the breed in its earlier and less improved\r\n    condition.\r\n\r\nRACE VI.--TURBIT AND OWL. (Möven-Taube: Pigeons à cravate.)\r\n\r\n_Feathers divergent along the front of the neck and breast; beak very\r\nshort, vertically rather thick; oesophagus somewhat enlarged._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--African Owl.]\r\n\r\n    Turbits and Owls differ from each other slightly in the shape of the\r\n    head, in the former having a crest, and in the curvature of the beak,\r\n    but they may be here conveniently grouped together. These pretty birds,\r\n    some of which are very small, can be recognised at once by the feathers\r\n    irregularly diverging, like a frill, along the front of the neck, in\r\n    the same manner, but in a less degree, as along the back of the neck in\r\n    the Jacobin. This bird has the remarkable habit of continually, and\r\n    momentarily inflating the upper part of the oesophagus, which causes a\r\n    movement in the frill. {149} When the oesophagus of a dead bird was\r\n    inflated, it was seen to be larger than in other breeds, and not so\r\n    distinctly separated from the crop. The Pouter inflates both its true\r\n    crop and oesophagus; the Turbit inflates in a much less degree the\r\n    oesophagus alone. The beak of the Turbit is very short, being .28 of an\r\n    inch shorter than that of the rock-pigeon, proportionally with the size\r\n    of their bodies; and in some owls brought by Mr. E. Vernon Harcourt\r\n    from Tunis, it was even shorter. The beak is vertically thicker, and\r\n    perhaps a little broader, in proportion to that of the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n{150}\r\n\r\nRACE VII.--TUMBLERS. (Tümmler, or Burzel-Tauben: Culbutants.)\r\n\r\n_During flight, tumble backwards; body generally small; beak generally\r\nshort, sometimes excessively short and conical._\r\n\r\n    This Race may be divided into four sub-races, namely, Persian, Lotan,\r\n    Common, and Short-faced Tumblers. These sub-races include many\r\n    varieties which breed true. I have examined eight skeletons of various\r\n    kinds of Tumblers: excepting in one imperfect and doubtful specimen,\r\n    the ribs are only seven in number, whereas the rock-pigeon has eight\r\n    ribs.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race I. Persian Tumblers._--I have received a pair direct from\r\n    Persia, from the Hon. C. Murray. They were rather smaller birds than\r\n    the wild rock-pigeon, being about the size of the common\r\n    dovecot-pigeon, white and mottled, slightly feathered on the feet, with\r\n    the beak just perceptibly shorter than in the rock-pigeon. H.M. Consul,\r\n    Mr. Keith Abbott, informs me that the difference in the length of beak\r\n    is so slight, that only practised Persian fanciers can distinguish\r\n    these Tumblers from the common pigeon of the country. He informs me\r\n    that they fly in flocks high up in the air and tumble well. Some of\r\n    them occasionally appear to become giddy and tumble to the ground, in\r\n    which respect they resemble some of our Tumblers.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race II. Lotan, or Lowtun: Indian Ground Tumblers._--These birds\r\n    present one of the most remarkable inherited habits or instincts which\r\n    have ever been recorded. The specimens sent to me from Madras by Sir W.\r\n    Elliot are white, slightly feathered on the feet, with the feathers on\r\n    the head reversed; and they are rather smaller than the rock or dovecot\r\n    pigeon. The beak is proportionally only slightly shorter and rather\r\n    thinner than in the rock-pigeon. These birds when gently shaken and\r\n    placed on the ground immediately begin tumbling head over heels, and\r\n    they continue thus to tumble until taken up and soothed,--the ceremony\r\n    being generally to blow in their faces, as in recovering a person from\r\n    a state of hypnotism or mesmerism. It is asserted that they will\r\n    continue to roll over till they die, if not taken up. There is abundant\r\n    evidence with respect to these remarkable peculiarities; but what makes\r\n    the case the more worthy of attention is, that the habit has been\r\n    strictly inherited since before the year 1600, for the breed is\r\n    distinctly described in the 'Ayeen Akbery.'[289] Mr. Evans kept a pair\r\n    in London, imported by Captain Vigne; and he assures me that he has\r\n    seen them tumble in the air, as well as in the manner above described\r\n    on the ground. Sir W. Elliot, however, writes to me from Madras, that\r\n    he is informed that they tumble exclusively on the ground, or at a very\r\n    small height above it. He also {151} mentions another sub-variety,\r\n    called the Kalmi Lotan, which begins to roll over if only touched on\r\n    the neck with a rod or wand.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. Common English Tumblers._--These birds have exactly the\r\n    same habits as the Persian Tumbler, but tumble better. The English bird\r\n    is rather smaller than the Persian, and the beak is plainly shorter.\r\n    Compared with the rock-pigeon, and proportionally with the size of\r\n    body, the beak is from .16 to nearly .2 of an inch shorter, but it is\r\n    not thinner. There are several varieties of the common Tumbler, namely,\r\n    Baldheads, Beards, and Dutch Rollers. I have kept the latter alive;\r\n    they have differently shaped heads, longer necks, and are\r\n    feather-footed. They tumble to an extraordinary degree; as Mr. Brent\r\n    remarks,[290] \"Every few seconds over they go; one, two, or three\r\n    summersaults at a time. Here and there a bird gives a very quick and\r\n    rapid spin, revolving like a wheel, though they sometimes lose their\r\n    balance, and make a rather ungraceful fall, in which they occasionally\r\n    hurt themselves by striking some object.\" From Madras I have received\r\n    several specimens of the common Tumbler of India, differing slightly\r\n    from each other in the length of their beaks. Mr. Brent sent me a dead\r\n    specimen of a \"House-tumbler,\"[291] which is a Scotch variety, not\r\n    differing in general appearance and form of beak from the common\r\n    Tumbler. Mr. Brent states that these birds generally begin to tumble\r\n    \"almost as soon as they can well fly; at three months old they tumble\r\n    well, but still fly strong; at five or six months they tumble\r\n    excessively; and in the second year they mostly give up flying, on\r\n    account of their tumbling so much and so close to the ground. Some fly\r\n    round with the flock, throwing a clean summersault every few yards,\r\n    till they are obliged to settle from giddiness and exhaustion. These\r\n    are called Air Tumblers, and they commonly throw from twenty to thirty\r\n    summersaults in a minute, each clear and clean. I have one red cock\r\n    that I have on two or three occasions timed by my watch, and counted\r\n    forty summersaults in the minute. Others tumble differently. At first\r\n    they throw a single summersault, then it is double, till it becomes a\r\n    continuous roll, which puts an end to flying, for if they fly a few\r\n    yards over they go, and roll till they reach the ground. Thus I had one\r\n    kill herself, and another broke his leg. Many of them turn over only a\r\n    few inches from the ground, and will tumble two or three times in\r\n    flying across their loft. These are called House-tumblers, from\r\n    tumbling in the house. The act of tumbling seems to be one over which\r\n    they have no control, an involuntary movement which they seem to try to\r\n    prevent. I have seen a bird sometimes in his struggles fly a yard or\r\n    two straight upwards, the impulse forcing him backwards while he\r\n    struggles to go forwards. If suddenly startled, or in a strange place,\r\n    they seem less able to fly than if quiet in their accustomed loft.\"\r\n    These House-tumblers differ from the Lotan or Ground {152} Tumbler of\r\n    India, in not requiring to be shaken in order to begin tumbling. The\r\n    breed has probably been formed merely by selecting the best common\r\n    Tumblers, though it is possible that they may have been crossed at some\r\n    former period with Lotans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Short-faced English Tumbler.]\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race IV. Short-faced Tumblers._--These are marvellous birds, and\r\n    are the glory and pride of many fanciers. In their extremely short,\r\n    sharp, and conical beaks, with the skin over the nostrils but little\r\n    developed, they almost depart from the type of the Columbidæ. Their\r\n    heads are nearly globular {153} and upright in front, so that some\r\n    fanciers say[292] \"the head should resemble a cherry with a barley-corn\r\n    stuck in it.\" These are the smallest kind of pigeons. Mr. Esquilant\r\n    possessed a blue Baldhead, two years old, which when alive weighed,\r\n    before feeding-time, only 6 oz. 5 drs.; two others, each weighed 7 oz.\r\n    We have seen that a wild rock-pigeon weighed 14 oz. 2 drs., and a Runt\r\n    34 oz. 4 drs. Short-faced Tumblers have a remarkably erect carriage,\r\n    with prominent breasts, drooping wings, and very small feet. The length\r\n    of the beak from the tip to the feathered base was in one good bird\r\n    only .4 of an inch; in a wild rock-pigeon it was exactly double this\r\n    length. As these Tumblers have shorter bodies than the wild\r\n    rock-pigeon, they ought of course to have shorter beaks; but\r\n    proportionally with the size of body, the beak is .28 of an inch too\r\n    short. So, again, the feet of this bird were actually .45 shorter, and\r\n    proportionally .21 of an inch shorter, than the feet of the\r\n    rock-pigeon. The middle toe has only twelve or thirteen, instead of\r\n    fourteen or fifteen scutellæ. The primary wing-feathers are not rarely\r\n    only nine instead of ten in number. The improved short-faced Tumblers\r\n    have almost lost the power of tumbling; but there are several authentic\r\n    accounts of their occasionally tumbling. There are several\r\n    sub-varieties, such as Baldheads, Beards, Mottles, and Almonds; the\r\n    latter are remarkable from not acquiring their perfectly-coloured\r\n    plumage until they have moulted three or four times. There is good\r\n    reason to believe that most of these sub-varieties, some of which breed\r\n    truly, have arisen since the publication of Moore's treatise in\r\n    1735.[293]\r\n\r\n    Finally, in regard to the whole group of Tumblers, it is impossible to\r\n    conceive a more perfect gradation than I have now lying before me, from\r\n    the rock-pigeon, through Persian, Lotan, and Common Tumblers, up to the\r\n    marvellous short-faced birds; which latter, no ornithologist, judging\r\n    from mere external structure, would place in the same genus with the\r\n    rock-pigeon. The differences between the successive steps in this\r\n    series are not greater than those which may be observed between common\r\n    dovecot-pigeons (_C. livia_) brought from different countries.\r\n\r\nRACE VIII--INDIAN FRILL-BACK.\r\n\r\n_Beak very short; feathers reversed._\r\n\r\n    A specimen of this bird, in spirits, was sent to me from Madras by Sir\r\n    W. Elliot. It is wholly different from the Frill-back often exhibited\r\n    in England. It is a smallish bird, about the size of the common\r\n    Tumbler, but has a beak in all its proportions like our short-faced\r\n    Tumblers. The beak, measured from the tip to the feathered base, was\r\n    only .46 of an inch in length. The feathers over the whole body are\r\n    reversed or curl backwards. Had this bird occurred in Europe, I should\r\n    have thought it only a monstrous variety of our improved Tumbler; but\r\n    as short-faced Tumblers are not known in India, I think it must rank as\r\n    a distinct breed. Probably {154} this is the breed seen by Hasselquist\r\n    in 1757 at Cairo, and said to have been imported from India.\r\n\r\nRACE IX.--JACOBIN. (Zopf or Perücken-Taube: Nonnains.)\r\n\r\n_Feathers of the neck forming a hood; wings and tail long; beak moderately\r\nshort._\r\n\r\n    This pigeon can at once be recognised by its hood, almost enclosing the\r\n    head and meeting in front of the neck. The hood seems to be merely an\r\n    exaggeration of the crest of reversed feathers on the back of the head,\r\n    which is common to many sub-varieties, and which in the Latz-taube[294]\r\n    is in a nearly intermediate state between a hood and a crest. The\r\n    feathers of the hood are elongated. Both the wings and tail are\r\n    likewise much elongated; thus the folded wing of the Jacobin, though a\r\n    somewhat smaller bird, is fully 1¼ inch longer than in the rock-pigeon.\r\n    Taking the length of the body without the tail as the standard of\r\n    comparison, the folded wing, proportionally with the wings of the\r\n    rock-pigeon, is 2¼ inches too long, and the two wings, from tip to tip,\r\n    5¼ inches too long. In disposition this bird is singularly quiet,\r\n    seldom flying or moving about, as Bechstein and Riedel have likewise\r\n    remarked in Germany.[295] The latter author also notices the length of\r\n    the wings and tail. The beak is nearly .2 of an inch shorter in\r\n    proportion to the size of the body than in the rock-pigeon; but the\r\n    internal gape of the mouth is considerably wider.\r\n\r\nGROUP IV.\r\n\r\nThe birds of this group may be characterised by their resemblance in all\r\nimportant points of structure, especially in the beak, to the rock-pigeon.\r\nThe Trumpeter forms the only well-marked race. Of the numerous other\r\nsub-races and varieties I shall specify only a few of the most distinct,\r\nwhich I have myself seen and kept alive.\r\n\r\nRACE X.--TRUMPETER. (Trommel-Taube; Pigeon tambour; glougou.)\r\n\r\n_A tuft of feathers at the base of the beak curling forward; feet much\r\nfeathered; voice very peculiar; size exceeding that of the rock-pigeon._\r\n\r\n    This is a well-marked breed, with a peculiar voice, wholly unlike that\r\n    of any other pigeon. The coo is rapidly repeated, and is continued for\r\n    {155} several minutes; hence their name of Trumpeters. They are also\r\n    characterised by a tuft of elongated feathers, which curls forward over\r\n    the base of the beak, and which is possessed by no other breed. Their\r\n    feet are so heavily feathered, that they almost appear like little\r\n    wings. They are larger birds than the rock-pigeon, but their beak is of\r\n    very nearly the same proportional size. Their feet are rather small.\r\n    This breed was perfectly characterised in Moore's time, in 1735. Mr.\r\n    Brent says that two varieties exist, which differ in size.\r\n\r\nRACE XI.--_Scarcely differing in structure from the wild Columba livia._\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race 1. Laughers. Size less than the Rock-pigeon; voice very\r\n    peculiar._--As this bird agrees in nearly all its proportions with the\r\n    rock-pigeon, though of smaller size, I should not have thought it\r\n    worthy of mention, had it not been for its peculiar voice--a character\r\n    supposed seldom to vary with birds. Although the voice of the Laugher\r\n    is very different from that of the Trumpeter, yet one of my Trumpeters\r\n    used to utter a single note like that of the Laugher. I have kept two\r\n    varieties of Laughers, which differed only in one variety being\r\n    turn-crowned; the smooth-headed kind, for which I am indebted to the\r\n    kindness of Mr. Brent, besides its peculiar note, used to coo in a\r\n    singular and pleasing manner, which, independently, struck both Mr.\r\n    Brent and myself as resembling that of the turtle-dove. Both varieties\r\n    come from Arabia. This breed was known by Moore in 1735. A pigeon which\r\n    seems to say Yak-roo is mentioned in 1600 in the 'Ayeen Akbery,' and is\r\n    probably the same breed. Sir W. Elliot has also sent me from Madras a\r\n    pigeon called Yahui, said to have come from Mecca, which does not\r\n    differ in appearance from the Laugher; it has \"a deep melancholy voice,\r\n    like Yahu, often repeated.\" Yahu, yahu, means Oh God, Oh God; and\r\n    Sayzid Mohammed Musari, in the treatise written about 100 years ago,\r\n    says that these birds \"are not flown, because they repeat the name of\r\n    the Most High God.\" Mr. Keith Abbott, however, informs me that the\r\n    common pigeon is called Yahoo in Persia.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race II. Common Frill-back_ (Die Strupp-Taube). _Beak rather\r\n    longer than in the Rock-pigeon; feathers reversed._--This is a\r\n    considerably larger bird than the rock-pigeons and with the beak,\r\n    proportionally with the size of body, a little (viz. by .04 of an inch)\r\n    longer. The feathers, especially on the wing-coverts, have their points\r\n    curled upwards or backwards.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race III. Nuns_ (Pigeons-coquilles).--These elegant birds are\r\n    smaller than the rock-pigeon. The beak is actually .17, and\r\n    proportionally with the size of the body .1 of an inch shorter than in\r\n    the rock-pigeons, although of the same thickness. In young birds the\r\n    scutellæ on the tarsi and toes are generally of a leaden-black colour;\r\n    and this is a remarkable character (though observed in a lesser degree\r\n    in some other breeds), as the colour of the legs in the adult state is\r\n    subject to very little variation in any breed. I have on two or three\r\n    occasions counted thirteen or fourteen feathers in the tail; this\r\n    likewise occurs in the barely distinct breed called Helmets. {156} Nuns\r\n    are symmetrically coloured, with the head, primary wing-feathers, tail,\r\n    and tail-coverts of the same colour, namely, black or red, and with the\r\n    rest of the body white. This breed has retained the same character\r\n    since Aldrovandi wrote in 1600. I have received from Madras almost\r\n    similarly coloured birds.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race IV. Spots_ (Die Blass-Taube: Pigeons heurtés).--These birds\r\n    are a very little larger than the rock-pigeon, with the beak a trace\r\n    smaller in all its dimensions, and with the feet decidedly smaller.\r\n    They are symmetrically coloured, with a spot on the forehead, with the\r\n    tail and tail-coverts of the same colour, the rest of the body being\r\n    white. This breed existed in 1676;[296] and in 1735 Moore remarks that\r\n    they breed truly, as is the case at the present day.\r\n\r\n    _Sub-race V. Swallows._--These birds, as measured from tip to tip of\r\n    wing, or from the end of the beak to the end of the tail, exceed in\r\n    size the rock-pigeon; but their bodies are much less bulky; their feet\r\n    and legs are likewise smaller. The beak is of about the same length,\r\n    but rather slighter. Altogether their general appearance is\r\n    considerably different from that of the rock-pigeon. Their heads and\r\n    wings are of the same colour, the rest of the body being white. Their\r\n    flight is said to be peculiar. This seems to be a modern breed, which,\r\n    however, originated before the year 1795 in Germany, for it is\r\n    described by Bechstein.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Besides the several breeds now described, three or four other very\r\n    distinct kinds existed lately, or perhaps still exist, in Germany and\r\n    France. Firstly, the Karmeliten, or Carme Pigeon, which I have not\r\n    seen; it is described as of small size, with very short legs, and with\r\n    an extremely short beak. Secondly, the Finnikin, which is now extinct\r\n    in England. It had, according to Moore's[297] treatise, published in\r\n    1735, a tuft of feathers on the hinder part of the head, which ran down\r\n    its back not unlike a horse's mane. \"When it is salacious it rises over\r\n    the hen and turns round three or four times, flapping its wings, then\r\n    reverses and turns as many times the other way.\" The Turner, on the\r\n    other hand, when it \"plays to the female, turns only one way.\" Whether\r\n    these extraordinary statements may be trusted I know not; but the\r\n    inheritance of any habit may be believed, after what we have seen with\r\n    respect to the Ground-tumbler of India. MM. Boitard and Corbié describe\r\n    a pigeon[298] which has the singular habit of sailing for a\r\n    considerable time through the air, without flapping its wings, like a\r\n    bird of prey. The confusion is inextricable, from the time of\r\n    Aldrovandi in 1600 to the present day, in the accounts published of the\r\n    Draijers, Smiters, Finnikins, Turners, Claquers, &c., which are all\r\n    remarkable from their manner of flight. Mr. Brent informs me that he\r\n    has seen one of these breeds in Germany with its wing-feathers injured\r\n    from having been so often struck together; but he did not see it\r\n    flying. An old stuffed specimen of a Finnikin in the British Museum\r\n    presents no well-marked character. Thirdly, a singular pigeon {157}\r\n    with a forked tail is mentioned in some treatises; and as\r\n    Bechstein[299] briefly describes and figures this bird, with a tail\r\n    \"having completely the structure of that of the house-swallow,\" it must\r\n    once have, existed, for Bechstein was far too good a naturalist to have\r\n    confounded any distinct species with the domestic pigeon. Lastly, an\r\n    extraordinary pigeon imported from Belgium has lately been exhibited at\r\n    the Philoperisteron Society in London,[300] which \"conjoins the colour\r\n    of an archangel with the head of an owl or barb, its most striking\r\n    peculiarity being the extraordinary length of the tail and\r\n    wing-feathers, the latter crossing beyond the tail, and giving to the\r\n    bird the appearance of a gigantic swift (Cypselus), or long-winged\r\n    hawk.\" Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that this bird weighed only 10 ounces,\r\n    but in length was 15½ inches from tip of beak to end of tail, and 32½\r\n    inches from tip to tip of wing; now the wild rock-pigeon weighs 14½\r\n    ounces, and measures from tip of beak to end of tail 15 inches, and\r\n    from tip to tip of wing only 26¾ inches.\r\n\r\nI have now described all the domestic pigeons known to me, and have added a\r\nfew others on reliable authority. I have classed them under four Groups, in\r\norder to mark their affinities and degrees of difference; but the third\r\ngroup is artificial. The kinds examined by me form eleven races, which\r\ninclude several sub-races; and even these latter present differences that\r\nwould certainly have been thought of specific value if observed in a state\r\nof nature. The sub-races likewise include many strictly inherited\r\nvarieties; so that altogether there must exist, as previously stated, above\r\n150 kinds which can be distinguished, though generally by characters of\r\nextremely slight importance. Many of the genera of the Columbidæ, which are\r\nadmitted by ornithologists, do not differ in any great degree from each\r\nother; taking this into consideration, there can be no doubt that several\r\nof the most strongly characterised domestic forms, if found wild, would\r\nhave been placed in at least five new genera. Thus, a new genus would have\r\nbeen formed for the reception of the improved English Pouter: a second\r\ngenus for Carriers and Runts; and this would have been a wide or\r\ncomprehensive genus, for it would have admitted common Spanish Runts\r\nwithout any wattle, short-beaked Runts like the Tronfo, and the improved\r\nEnglish Carrier: a third genus would have been termed for the Barb: a\r\nfourth for the Fantail: and lastly, a fifth for the short-beaked,\r\nnot-wattled pigeons, such as Turbits {158} and short-faced Tumblers. The\r\nremaining domestic forms might have been included in the same genus with\r\nthe wild rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n_Individual Variability; Variations of a remarkable nature._\r\n\r\nThe differences which we have as yet considered are characteristic of\r\ndistinct breeds; but there are other differences, either confined to\r\nindividual birds, or often observed in certain breeds but not\r\ncharacteristic of them. These individual differences are of importance, as\r\nthey might in most cases be secured and accumulated by man's power of\r\nselection; and thus an existing breed might be greatly modified or a new\r\none formed. Fanciers notice and select only those slight differences which\r\nare externally visible; but the whole organisation is so tied together by\r\ncorrelation of growth, that a change in one part is frequently accompanied\r\nby other changes. For our purpose, modifications of all kinds are equally\r\nimportant, and, if affecting a part which does not commonly vary, are of\r\nmore importance than a modification in some conspicuous part. At the\r\npresent day any visible deviation of character in a well-established breed\r\nis rejected as a blemish; but it by no means follows that at an early\r\nperiod, before well-marked breeds had been formed, such deviations would\r\nhave been rejected; on the contrary, they would have been eagerly preserved\r\nas presenting a novelty, and would then have been slowly augmented, as we\r\nshall hereafter more clearly see, by the process of unconscious selection.\r\n\r\n    I have made numerous measurements of the various parts of the body in\r\n    the several breeds, and have hardly ever found them quite the same in\r\n    birds of the same breed,--the differences being greater than we\r\n    commonly meet with in wild species. To begin with the primary feathers\r\n    of the wing and tail; but I may first mention, as some readers may not\r\n    be aware of the fact, that the number of the primary wing and tail\r\n    feathers in wild birds is generally constant, and characterises, not\r\n    only whole genera, but even whole families. When the tail-feathers are\r\n    unusually numerous, as for instance in the swan, they are apt to be\r\n    variable in number; but this does not apply to the several species and\r\n    genera of the Columbidæ, which never (as far as I can hear) have less\r\n    than twelve or more than sixteen tail-feathers; and these numbers\r\n    characterise, with rare exception, whole sub-families.[301] The wild\r\n    rock-pigeon has twelve tail-feathers. With {159} Fantails, as we have\r\n    seen, the number varies from fourteen to forty-two. In two young birds\r\n    in the same nest I counted twenty-two and twenty-seven feathers.\r\n    Pouters are very liable to have additional tail-feathers, and I have\r\n    seen on several occasions fourteen or fifteen in my own birds, Mr. Bult\r\n    had a specimen, examined by Mr. Yarrell, with seventeen tail-feathers.\r\n    I had a Nun with thirteen, and another with fourteen tail-feathers; and\r\n    in a Helmet, a breed barely distinguishable from the Nun, I have\r\n    counted fifteen, and have heard of other such instances. On the other\r\n    hand, Mr. Brent possessed a Dragon, which during its whole life never\r\n    had more than ten tail-feathers; and one of my Dragons, descended from\r\n    Mr. Brent's, had only eleven. I have seen a Baldhead-Tumbler with only\r\n    ten; and Mr. Brent had an Air-Tumbler with the same number, but another\r\n    with fourteen tail-feathers. Two of these latter Tumblers, bred by Mr.\r\n    Brent, were remarkable,--one from having the two central tail-feathers\r\n    a little divergent, and the other from having the two outer feathers\r\n    longer by three-eighths of an inch than the others; so that in both\r\n    cases the tail exhibited a tendency, but in different ways, to become\r\n    forked. And this shows us how a swallow-tailed breed, like that\r\n    described by Bechstein, might have been formed by careful selection.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the primary wing-feathers, the number in the Columbidæ,\r\n    as far as I can find out, is always nine or ten. In the rock-pigeon it\r\n    is ten; but I have seen no less than eight short-faced Tumblers with\r\n    only nine primaries, and the occurrence of this number has been noticed\r\n    by fanciers, owing to ten flight-feathers of a white colour being one\r\n    of the points in Short-faced Baldhead-Tumblers. Mr. Brent, however, had\r\n    an Air-Tumbler (not short-faced) which had in both wings eleven\r\n    primaries. Mr. Corker, the eminent breeder of prize Carriers, assures\r\n    me that some of his birds had eleven primaries in both wings. I have\r\n    seen eleven in one wing in two Pouters. I have been assured by three\r\n    fanciers that they have seen twelve in Scanderoons; but as Neumeister\r\n    asserts that in the allied Florence Runt the middle flight-feather is\r\n    often double, the number twelve may have been caused by two of the ten\r\n    primaries having each two shafts to a single feather. The secondary\r\n    wing-feathers are difficult to count, but the number seems to vary from\r\n    twelve to fifteen. The length of the wing and tail relatively to the\r\n    body, and of the wings to the tail, certainly varies; I have especially\r\n    noticed this in Jacobins. In Mr. Bult's magnificent collection of\r\n    Pouters, the wings and tail varied greatly in length; and were\r\n    sometimes so much elongated that the birds could hardly play upright.\r\n    In the relative length of the few first primaries I have observed only\r\n    a slight degree of variability. Mr. Brent informs me that he has\r\n    observed the shape of the first feather to vary very slightly. But the\r\n    variation in these latter points is extremely slight compared with what\r\n    may often be observed in the natural species of the Columbidæ.\r\n\r\n    In the beak I have observed very considerable differences in birds of\r\n    the {160} same breed, as in carefully bred Jacobins and Trumpeters. In\r\n    Carriers there is often a conspicuous difference in the degree of\r\n    attenuation and curvature of the beak. So it is indeed in many breeds:\r\n    thus I had two strains of black Barbs, which evidently differed in the\r\n    curvature of the upper mandible. In width of mouth I have found a great\r\n    difference in two Swallows. In Fantails of first-rate merit I have seen\r\n    some birds with much longer and thinner necks than in others. Other\r\n    analogous facts could be given. We have seen that the oil-gland is\r\n    aborted in all Fantails (with the exception of the sub-race from Java),\r\n    and, I may add, so hereditary is this tendency to abortion, that some,\r\n    although not all, of the mongrels from the Fantail and Pouter had no\r\n    oil-gland; in one Swallow out of many which I have examined, and in two\r\n    Nuns, there was no oil-gland.\r\n\r\n    The number of the scutellæ on the toes often varies in the same breed,\r\n    and sometimes even differs on the two feet of the same individual; the\r\n    Shetland rock-pigeon has fifteen on the middle, and six on the hinder\r\n    toe; whereas I have seen a Runt with sixteen on the middle and eight on\r\n    the hind toe; and a short-faced Tumbler with only twelve and five on\r\n    these same toes. The rock-pigeon has no sensible amount of skin between\r\n    its toes; but I possessed a Spot and a Nun with the skin extending for\r\n    a space of a quarter of an inch from the fork, between the two _inner_\r\n    toes. On the other hand, as will hereafter be more fully shown, pigeons\r\n    with feathered feet very generally have the bases of their _outer_ toes\r\n    connected by skin. I had a red Tumbler, which had a coo unlike that of\r\n    its fellows, approaching in tone to that of the Laugher: this bird had\r\n    the habit, to a degree which I never saw equalled in any other pigeon,\r\n    of often walking with its wings raised and arched in an elegant manner.\r\n    I need say nothing on the great variability, in almost every breed, in\r\n    size of body, in colour, in the feathering of the feet, and in the\r\n    feathers on the back of the head being reversed. But I may mention a\r\n    remarkable Tumbler[302] exhibited at the Crystal Palace, which had an\r\n    irregular crest of feathers on its head, somewhat like the tuft on the\r\n    head of the Polish fowl. Mr. Bult reared by accident a hen Jacobin with\r\n    the feathers on the thigh so long as to reach the ground, and a cock\r\n    having, but in a lesser degree, the same peculiarity: from these two\r\n    birds he bred others similarly characterised, which were exhibited at\r\n    the Philoperisteron Club. I bred a mongrel pigeon which had fibrous\r\n    feathers, and the wing and tail-feathers so short and imperfect that\r\n    the bird could not fly even a foot in height.\r\n\r\nThere are many singular and inherited peculiarities in the plumage of\r\npigeons: thus Almond-Tumblers do not acquire their perfect mottled feathers\r\nuntil they have moulted three or four times: the Kite-Tumbler is at first\r\nbrindled black and red with a barred appearance, but when \"it throws its\r\nnest feathers it becomes almost black, generally with a bluish tail, and a\r\nreddish colour on the inner webs of the primary wing feathers.\"[303] {161}\r\nNeumeister describes a breed of a black colour with white bars on the wing\r\nand a white crescent-shaped mark on the breast; these marks are generally\r\nrusty-red before the first moult, but after the third or fourth moult they\r\nundergo a change; the wing-feathers and the crown of the head likewise then\r\nbecome white or grey.[304]\r\n\r\nIt is an important fact, and I believe there is hardly an exception to the\r\nrule, that the especial characters for which each breed is valued are\r\neminently variable: thus, in the Fantail, the number and direction of the\r\ntail-feathers, the carriage of the body, and the degree of trembling are\r\nall highly variable points; in Pouters, the degree to which they pout, and\r\nthe shape of their inflated crops; in the Carrier, the length, narrowness,\r\nand curvature of the beak, and the amount of wattle; in Short-faced\r\nTumblers, the shortness of the beak, the prominence of the forehead, and\r\ngeneral carriage,[305] and in the Almond Tumbler the colour of the plumage;\r\nin common Tumblers, the manner of tumbling; in the Barb, the breadth and\r\nshortness of the beak and the amount of eye-wattle; in Runts, the size of\r\nbody; in Turbits, the frill; and lastly in Trumpeters, the cooing, as well\r\nas the size of the tuft of feathers over the nostrils. These, which are the\r\ndistinctive and selected characters of the several breeds, are all\r\neminently variable.\r\n\r\nThere is another interesting fact with respect to the character of the\r\ndifferent breeds, namely, that they are often most strongly displayed in\r\nthe male bird. In Carriers, when the males and females are exhibited in\r\nseparate pens, the wattle is plainly seen to be much more developed in the\r\nmales, though I have seen a hen Carrier belonging to Mr. Haynes heavily\r\nwattled. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that, in twenty Barbs in Mr. P. H.\r\nJones's possession, the males had generally the largest eye-wattles; Mr.\r\nEsquilant also believes in this rule, but Mr. H. Weir, a first-rate judge,\r\nentertains some doubt on the subject. Hale Pouters distend their crops to a\r\nmuch greater size than do the females; I have, however, seen a hen in the\r\npossession of Mr. Evans which pouted excellently; but this is an unusual\r\ncircumstance. Mr. Harrison Weir, a successful breeder of prize {162}\r\nFantails, informs me that his cock birds often have a greater number of\r\ntail-feathers than the hens. Mr. Eaton asserts[306] that, if a cock and hen\r\nTumbler were of equal merit, the hen would be worth double the money; and\r\nas pigeons always pair, so that an equal number of both sexes is necessary\r\nfor reproduction, this seems to show that high merit is rarer in the female\r\nthan in the male. In the development of the frill in Turbits, of the hood\r\nin Jacobins, of the tuft in Trumpeters, of tumbling in Tumblers, there is\r\nno difference between the males and females. I may here add a rather\r\ndifferent case, namely, the existence in France[307] of a wine-coloured\r\nvariety of the Pouter, in which the male is generally chequered with black,\r\nwhilst the female is never so chequered. Dr. Chapuis also remarks[308] that\r\nin certain light-coloured pigeons the males have their feathers striated\r\nwith black, and these striæ increase in size at each moult, so that the\r\nmale ultimately becomes spotted with black. With Carriers, the wattle, both\r\non the beak and round the eyes, and with Barbs that round the eyes, goes on\r\nincreasing with age. This augmentation of character with advancing age, and\r\nmore especially the difference between the males and females in the\r\nabove-mentioned several respects, are highly remarkable facts, for there is\r\nno sensible difference at any age between the two sexes in the aboriginal\r\nrock-pigeon; and rarely any such difference throughout the whole family of\r\nthe Columbidæ.[309]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Skulls of Pigeons, viewed laterally, of natural\r\nsize.

Bagadotten Carrier.]\r\n\r\n_Osteological Characters._\r\n\r\nIn the skeletons of the various breeds there is much variability; and\r\nthough certain differences occur frequently, and others rarely, in certain\r\nbreeds, yet none can be said to be absolutely characteristic of any breed.\r\nConsidering that strongly-marked domestic races have been formed chiefly by\r\nman's power {163} of selection, we ought not to expect to find great and\r\nconstant differences in the skeleton; for fanciers can neither see, nor do\r\nthey care for, modifications of structure in the internal framework. Nor\r\nought we to expect changes in the skeletons from hanged habits of life; as\r\nevery facility is given to the most distinct breeds to follow the same\r\nhabits, and the much modified races are never allowed to wander abroad and\r\nprocure their own food in various ways. Moreover, I find, on comparing the\r\nskeletons of _Columba livia_, _oenas_, _palumbus_, and _turtur_, which are\r\nranked by all systematists in two or three distinct though allied genera,\r\nthat the differences are extremely slight, certainly less than between the\r\nskeletons of some of the most distinct domestic breeds. How far the\r\nskeleton of the wild rock-pigeon is constant I have no means of judging, as\r\nI have examined only two.\r\n\r\n    _Skull._--The individual bones, especially those at the base, do not\r\n    differ in shape. But the whole skull, in its proportions, outline, and\r\n    relative direction of the bones, differs greatly in some of the breeds,\r\n    as may be seen by comparing the figures of (A) the wild rock-pigeon,\r\n    (B) the {164} shortfaced tumbler, (C) the English carrier, and (D) the\r\n    Bagadotten carrier (of Neumeister), all drawn of the natural size and\r\n    viewed laterally. In the carrier, besides the elongation of the bones\r\n    of the face, the space between the orbits is proportionally a little\r\n    narrower than in the rock-pigeon. In the Bagadotten the upper mandible\r\n    is remarkably arched, and the premaxillary bones are proportionally\r\n    broader. In the short-faced tumbler the skull is more globular; all the\r\n    bones of the face are much shortened, and the front of the skull and\r\n    descending nasal bones are almost perpendicular; the maxillo-jugal arch\r\n    and premaxillary bones form an almost straight line; the space between\r\n    the prominent edges of the eye-orbits is depressed. In the barb the\r\n    premaxillary bones are much shortened, and their anterior portion is\r\n    thicker than in the rock-pigeon, as is the lower part of the nasal\r\n    bone. In two nuns the ascending branches of the premaxillaries, near\r\n    their tips, were somewhat attenuated, and in these birds, as well as in\r\n    some others, for instance in the spot, the occipital crest over the\r\n    foramen was considerably more prominent than in the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Lower jaws, seen from above, of natural size. A.\r\nRock-pigeon. B. Runt. C. Barb.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Skull of Runt, seen from above, of natural size,\r\nshowing the reflexed margin of the distal portion of the lower jaw.]\r\n\r\n    In the lower jaw, the articular surface is proportionally smaller in\r\n    many breeds than in the rock-pigeon; and the vertical diameter more\r\n    especially of the outer part of the articular surface is considerably\r\n    shorter. May not this be accounted for by the lessened use of the jaws,\r\n    owing to nutritious food having been given during a long period to all\r\n    highly improved pigeons? In runts, carriers, and barbs (and in a lesser\r\n    degree in several breeds), the whole side of the jaw near the articular\r\n    end is bent inwards in a highly remarkable manner; and the superior\r\n    margin of the ramus, beyond the middle, is reflexed in an equally\r\n    remarkable manner, as may be seen in the accompanying figures, in\r\n    comparison with the jaw of the rock-pigeon. This reflexion of the upper\r\n    margin of the lower jaw is plainly connected with the singularly wide\r\n    gape of the mouth, as has been described in runts, carriers, and barbs.\r\n    The reflexion is well shown in fig. 26 of the head of a runt seen from\r\n    above; here a wide open space may be observed on each side, between the\r\n    edges of the lower jaw and of the premaxillary {165} bones. In the\r\n    rock-pigeon, and in several domestic breeds, the edges of the lower jaw\r\n    on each side come close up to the premaxillary bones, so that no open\r\n    space is left. The degree of downward curvature of the distal half of\r\n    the lower jaw also differs to an extraordinary degree in some breeds,\r\n    as may be seen in the drawings (fig. A) of the rock-pigeon, (B) of the\r\n    short-faced tumbler, and (C) of the Bagadotten carrier of Neumeister.\r\n    In some runts the symphysis of the lower jaw is remarkably solid. No\r\n    one would readily have believed that jaws differing so greatly in the\r\n    several above-specified points could have belonged to the same species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Lateral view of jaws, of natural size. A.\r\nRock-pigeon. B. Short-faced Tumbler. C. Bagadotten Carrier.]\r\n\r\n    _Vertebræ._-- All the breeds have twelve cervical vertebræ.[310] But in\r\n    a Bussorah carrier from India, the twelfth vertebra carried a small\r\n    rib, a quarter of an inch in length, with a perfect double\r\n    articulation.\r\n\r\n    The _dorsal vertebræ_ are always eight. In the rock-pigeon all eight\r\n    bear ribs; the eighth rib being very thin, and the seventh having no\r\n    process. In pouters all the ribs are extremely broad, and, in three out\r\n    of four skeletons examined by me, the eighth rib was twice or even\r\n    thrice as broad as in the rock-pigeon; and the seventh pair had\r\n    distinct processes. In many breeds there are only seven ribs, as in\r\n    seven out of eight skeletons of various tumblers, and in several\r\n    skeletons of fantails, turbits, and nuns. In all these breeds the\r\n    seventh pair was very small, and was destitute of processes, in which\r\n    respect it differed from the same rib in the rock-pigeon. In one\r\n    tumbler, and in the Bussorah carrier, even the sixth pair had no\r\n    process. The hypapophysis of the second dorsal vertebra varies much in\r\n    development; being sometimes (as in several, but {166} not all\r\n    tumblers) nearly as prominent as that of the third dorsal vertebra; and\r\n    the two hypapophyses together tend to form an ossified arch. The\r\n    development of the arch, formed by the hypapophyses of the third and\r\n    fourth dorsal vertebræ, also varies considerably, as does the size of\r\n    the hypapophysis of the fifth vertebra.\r\n\r\n    The rock-pigeon has twelve _sacral vertebræ_; but these vary in number,\r\n    relative size, and distinctness in the different breeds. In pouters,\r\n    with their elongated bodies, there are thirteen or even fourteen, and,\r\n    as we shall immediately see, an additional number of caudal vertebræ.\r\n    In runts and carriers there is generally the proper number, namely\r\n    twelve; but in one runt, and in the Bussorah carrier, there were only\r\n    eleven. In tumblers there are either eleven, twelve, or thirteen sacral\r\n    vertebræ.\r\n\r\n    The _caudal vertebræ_ are seven in number in the rock-pigeon. In\r\n    fantails, which have their tails so largely developed, there are either\r\n    eight or nine, and apparently in one case ten, and they are a little\r\n    longer than in the rock-pigeon, and their shape varies considerably.\r\n    Pouters, also, have eight or nine caudal vertebræ. I have seen eight in\r\n    a nun and jacobin. Tumblers, though such small birds, always have the\r\n    normal number seven; as have carriers, with one exception, in which\r\n    there were only six.\r\n\r\n    The following table will serve as a summary, and will show the most\r\n    remarkable deviations in the number of the vertebræ and ribs which I\r\n    have observed:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  +----------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+-------------+\r\n  |          |  Rock       |Pouter,       |   Tumbler,      |    Bussorah |\r\n  |          |  Pigeon.    |from Mr. Bult.|   Dutch Roller. |    Carrier. |\r\n  +----------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+-------------+\r\n  |Cervical  |             |              |                 |             |\r\n  |Vertebræ  |    12       |     12       |       12        |       12    |\r\n  |          |             |              |                 |  The 12th   |\r\n  |          |             |              |                 |   bore a    |\r\n  |          |             |              |                 |  small rib. |\r\n  |Dorsal    |             |              |                 |             |\r\n  |Vertebræ  |     8       |      8       |        8        |        8    |\r\n  |          |             |              |                 |             |\r\n  |Dorsal    |             |              |                 |             |\r\n  |Ribs      |     8       |      8       |        7        |        7    |\r\n  |          |The 6th pair |The 6th & 7th | The 6th & 7th   |The 6th & 7th|\r\n  |          |    with     |  pair with   |  pair without   |pair without |\r\n  |          | processes,  |  processes.  |  processes.     | processes.  |\r\n  |          |the 7th pair |              |                 |             |\r\n  |          | without a   |              |                 |             |\r\n  |          |  process.   |              |                 |             |\r\n  |          |             |              |                 |             |\r\n  |Sacral    |             |              |                 |             |\r\n  |Vertebræ  |    12       |      14      |        11       |       11    |\r\n  |Caudal    |             |              |                 |             |\r\n  |Vertebræ  |     7       |    8 or 9    |         7       |        7    |\r\n  |          +-------------+--------------+-----------------+-------------+\r\n  |Total     |             |              |                 |             |\r\n  |Vertebræ  |    39       |   42 or 43   |        38       |       38    |\r\n  +----------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n    The _pelvis_ differs very little in any breed. The anterior margin of\r\n    the ilium, however, is sometimes a little more equally rounded on both\r\n    sides than in the rock-pigeon, The ischium is also frequently rather\r\n    more elongated. The obturator-notch is sometimes, as in many tumblers,\r\n    less developed than in the rock-pigeon. The ridges on the ilium are\r\n    very prominent in most runts.\r\n\r\n    In the bones of the extremities I could detect no difference, except in\r\n    their proportional lengths; for instance, the metatarsus in a pouter\r\n    was 1.65 inch, and in a short-faced tumbler only .95 in length; and\r\n    this is a greater difference than would naturally follow from their\r\n    differently-sized bodies; but long legs in the pouter, and small feet\r\n    in the tumbler, are selected points. In some pouters the _scapula_ is\r\n    rather straighter, and in some {167} tumblers it is straighter, with\r\n    the apex less elongated, than in the rock-pigeon: in the woodcut, fig.\r\n    28, the scapulæ of the rock-pigeon (A), and of a short-faced tumbler\r\n    (B), are given. The processes at the summit of the _coracoid_, which\r\n    receive the extremities of the furcula, form a more perfect cavity in\r\n    some tumblers than in the rock-pigeon: in pouters these processes are\r\n    larger and differently shaped, and the exterior angle of the extremity\r\n    of the coracoid, which is articulated to the sternum, is squarer.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Furculæ, of natural size. A. Short-faced\r\n    Tumbler B and C. Fantails. D. Pouter.]\r\n\r\n    The two arms of the _furcula_ in pouters diverge less, proportionally\r\n    to their length, than in the rock-pigeon; and the symphysis is more\r\n    solid and pointed. In fantails the degree of divergence of the two arms\r\n    varies in a remarkable mariner. In fig. 29, B and C represent the\r\n    furculæ of two fantails; and it will be seen that the divergence in B\r\n    is rather less even than in the furcula of the short-faced, small-sized\r\n    tumbler (A); whereas the divergence in C equals that in a rock-pigeon,\r\n    or in the pouter (D), though the latter is a much larger bird. The\r\n    extremities of the furcula, where articulated to the coracoids, vary\r\n    considerably in outline.\r\n\r\n    In the _sternum_ the differences in form are slight, except in the size\r\n    and outline of the perforations, which, both in the larger and lesser\r\n    sized breeds, are sometimes small. These perforations, also, are\r\n    sometimes either nearly circular, or elongated, as is often the case\r\n    with carriers. The posterior perforations occasionally are not\r\n    complete, being left open posteriorly. The marginal apophyses forming\r\n    the anterior perforations vary greatly in development. The degree of\r\n    convexity of the posterior part of the sternum differs much, being\r\n    sometimes almost perfectly flat. The manubrium is rather more prominent\r\n    in some individuals than in others, and the pore immediately under it\r\n    varies greatly in size.\r\n\r\n_Correlation of Growth._--By this term I mean that the whole organisation\r\nis so connected, that when one part varies, other {168} parts vary; but\r\nwhich of two correlated variations ought to be looked at as the cause and\r\nwhich as the effect, or whether both result from some common cause, we can\r\nseldom or never tell. The point of interest for us is that, when fanciers,\r\nby the continued selection of slight variations, have largely modified one\r\npart, they often unintentionally produce other modifications. For instance,\r\nthe beak is readily acted on by selection, and, with its increased or\r\ndiminished length, the tongue increases or diminishes, but not in due\r\nproportion; for, in a barb and short-faced tumbler, both of which have very\r\nshort beaks, the tongue, taking the rock-pigeon as the standard of\r\ncomparison, was proportionally not shortened enough, whilst in two carriers\r\nand in a runt the tongue, proportionally with the beak, was not lengthened\r\nenough. Thus, in a first-rate English carrier, in which the beak from the\r\ntip to the feathered base was exactly thrice as long as in a first-rate\r\nshort-faced tumbler, the tongue was only a little more than twice as long.\r\nBut the tongue varies in length independently of the beak: thus, in a\r\ncarrier with a beak 1.2 inch in length, the tongue was .67 in length;\r\nwhilst in a runt which equalled the carrier in length of body and in\r\nstretch of wings from tip to tip, the beak was .92 whilst the tongue was\r\n.73 of an inch in length, so that the tongue was actually longer than in\r\nthe carrier with its long beak. The tongue of the runt was also very broad\r\nat the root. Of two runts, one had its beak longer by .23 of an inch,\r\nwhilst its tongue was shorter by .14 than in the other.\r\n\r\nWith the increased or diminished length of the beak the length of the slit\r\nforming the external orifice of the nostrils varies, but not in due\r\nproportion, for, taking the rock-pigeon as the standard, the orifice in a\r\nshort-faced tumbler was not shortened in due proportion with its very short\r\nbeak. On the other hand (and this could not have been anticipated), the\r\norifice in three English carriers, in the Bagadotten carrier, and in a runt\r\n(_pigeon cygne_), was longer by above the tenth of an inch than would\r\nfollow from the length of the beak proportionally with that of the\r\nrock-pigeon. In one carrier the orifice of the nostrils was thrice as long\r\nas in the rock-pigeon, though in body and length of beak this bird was not\r\nnearly double the size of the {169} rock-pigeon. This greatly increased\r\nlength of the orifice of the nostrils seems to stand partly in correlation\r\nwith the enlargement of the wattled skin on the upper mandible and over the\r\nnostrils; and this is a character which is selected by fanciers. So again,\r\nthe broad, naked, and wattled skin round the eyes of carriers and barbs is\r\na selected character; and in obvious correlation with this, the eyelids,\r\nmeasured longitudinally, are proportionally more than double the length of\r\nthose of the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe great difference (see woodcut No. 27) in the curvature of the lower jaw\r\nin the rock-pigeon, the tumbler, and Bagadotten carrier, stands in obvious\r\nrelation to the curvature of the upper jaw, and more especially to the\r\nangle formed by the maxillo-jugal arch with the premaxillary bones. But in\r\ncarriers, runts, and barbs the singular reflexion of the upper margin of\r\nthe middle part of the lower jaw (see woodcut No. 25) is not strictly\r\ncorrelated with the width or divergence (as may be clearly seen in woodcut\r\nNo. 26) of the premaxillary bones, but with the breadth of the horny and\r\nsoft parts of the upper mandible, which are always overlapped by the edges\r\nof the lower mandible.\r\n\r\nIn pouters, the elongation of the body is a selected character, and the\r\nribs, as we have seen, have generally become very broad, with the seventh\r\npair furnished with processes; the sacral and caudal vertebræ have been\r\naugmented in number; the sternum has likewise increased in length (but not\r\nin the depth of the crest) by .4 of an inch more than would follow from the\r\ngreater bulk of the body in comparison with that of the rock-pigeon. In\r\nfantails, the length and number of the caudal vertebræ have increased.\r\nHence, during the gradual progress of variation and selection, the internal\r\nbony frame-work and the external shape of the body have been, to a certain\r\nextent, modified in a correlated manner.\r\n\r\nAlthough the wings and tail often vary in length independently of each\r\nother, it is scarcely possible to doubt that they generally tend to become\r\nelongated or shortened in correlation. This is well seen in jacobins, and\r\nstill more plainly in runts, some varieties of which have their wings and\r\ntail of great length, whilst others have both very short. With jacobins,\r\nthe remarkable length of the tail and {170} wing-feathers is not a\r\ncharacter which is intentionally selected by fanciers; but fanciers have\r\nbeen trying for centuries, at least since the year 1600, to increase the\r\nlength of the reversed feathers on the neck, so that the hood may more\r\ncompletely enclose the head; and it may be suspected that the increased\r\nlength of the wing and tail-feathers stands in correlation with the\r\nincreased length of the neck-feathers. Short-faced tumblers have short\r\nwings in nearly due proportion with the reduced size of their bodies; but\r\nit is remarkable, seeing that the number of the primary wing-feathers is a\r\nconstant character in most birds, that these tumblers generally have only\r\nnine instead of ten primaries. I have myself observed this in eight birds;\r\nand the Original Columbarian Society[311] reduced the standard for\r\nbald-head tumblers from ten to nine white flight-feathers, thinking it\r\nunfair that a bird which had only nine feathers should be disqualified for\r\na prize because it had not ten _white_ flight-feathers. On the other hand,\r\nin carriers and runts, which have large bodies and long wings, eleven\r\nprimary feathers have occasionally been observed.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier has informed me of a curious and inexplicable case of\r\ncorrelation, namely, that young pigeons of all breeds, which when mature\r\nbecome white, yellow, silver (_i.e._ extremely pale blue), or dun-coloured,\r\nare born almost naked; whereas other coloured pigeons are born well clothed\r\nwith down. Mr. Esquilant, however, has observed that young dun carriers are\r\nnot so bare as young dun barbs and tumblers. Mr. Tegetmeier has seen two\r\nyoung birds in the same nest, produced from differently coloured parents,\r\nwhich differed greatly in the degree to which they were at first clothed\r\nwith down.\r\n\r\nI have observed another case of correlation which at first sight appears\r\nquite inexplicable, but on which, as we shall see in a future chapter, some\r\nlight can be thrown by the law of homologous parts varying in the same\r\nmanner. The case is, that, when the feet are much feathered, the roots of\r\nthe feathers are connected by a web of skin, and apparently in correlation\r\nwith this the two outer toes become connected for a considerable space by\r\nskin. I have observed this in very many {171} specimens of pouters,\r\ntrumpeters, swallows, roller-tumblers (likewise observed in this breed by\r\nMr. Brent), and in a lesser degree in other feather-footed pigeons.\r\n\r\nThe feet of the smaller and larger breeds are of course much smaller or\r\nlarger than those of the rock-pigeon; but the scutellæ or scales covering\r\nthe toes and tarsi have not only decreased or increased in size, but\r\nlikewise in number. To give a single instance, I have counted eight\r\nscutellæ on the hind toe of a runt, and only five on that of a short-faced\r\ntumbler. With birds in a state of nature the number of the scutellæ on the\r\nfeet is usually a constant character. The length of the feet and the length\r\nof the beak apparently stand in correlation; but as disuse apparently has\r\naffected the size of the feet, this case may come under the following\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_On the Effects of Disuse_.--In the following discussion on the relative\r\nproportions of the feet, sternum, furcula, scapulæ, and wings, I may\r\npremise, in order to give some confidence to the reader, that my\r\nmeasurements were all made in the same manner, and that all the\r\nmeasurements of the external parts were made without the least intention of\r\napplying them to the following purpose.\r\n\r\n    I measured most of the birds which came into my possession, from the\r\n    feathered _base_ of the beak (the length of beak itself being so\r\n    variable) to the end of the tail, and to the oil-gland, but\r\n    unfortunately (except in a few cases) not to the root of the tail; I\r\n    measured each bird from the extreme tip to tip of wing; and the length\r\n    of the terminal folded part of the wing, from the extremity of the\r\n    primaries to the joint of the radius. I measured the feet without the\r\n    claws, from the end of the middle toe to the end of the hind toe; and\r\n    the tarsus together with the middle toe. I have taken in every case the\r\n    mean measurement of two wild rock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands, as\r\n    the standard of comparison. The following table shows the actual length\r\n    of the feet in each bird; and the difference between the length which\r\n    the feet ought to have had according to the size of body of each, in\r\n    comparison with the size of body and length of feet of the rock-pigeon,\r\n    calculated (with a few specified exceptions) by the standard of the\r\n    length of the body from the base of the beak to the oil-gland. I have\r\n    preferred this standard, owing to the variability of the length of\r\n    tail. But I have made similar calculations, taking as the standard the\r\n    length from tip to tip of wing, and likewise in most cases from the\r\n    base of the beak to the end of the tail; and the result has always been\r\n    closely similar. To give an example: the first bird in the table, being\r\n    a short-faced tumbler, {172} is much smaller than the rock-pigeon, and\r\n    would naturally have shorter feet; but it is found on calculation to\r\n    have feet too short by .11 of an inch, in comparison with the feet of\r\n    the rock-pigeon, relatively to the size of the body in these two birds,\r\n    as measured from the base of beak to the oil-gland. So again, when this\r\n    same tumbler and the rock-pigeon were compared by the length of their\r\n    wings, or by the extreme length of their bodies, the feet of the\r\n    tumbler were likewise found to be too short in very nearly the same\r\n    proportion. I am well aware that the measurements pretend to greater\r\n    accuracy than is possible, but it was less trouble to write down the\r\n    actual measurements given by the compasses in each case than an\r\n    approximation.\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n_Pigeons with their beaks generally shorter than that of the Rock-pigeon,\r\nproportionally with the size of their bodies._\r\n\r\n

   In these two tables we see in the first column the actual length of the\r\n    feet in thirty-six birds belonging to various breeds, and in the two\r\n    other columns we see by how much the feet are too short or too long,\r\n    according to the size of bird, in comparison with the rock-pigeon. In\r\n    the first table twenty-two specimens have their feet too short, on an\r\n    average by a little above the tenth of an inch (viz. .107); and five\r\n    specimens have their feet on an average a very little too long, namely,\r\n    by .07 of an inch. But some of these latter and exceptional cases can\r\n    be explained; for instance, with pouters the legs and feet are selected\r\n    for length, and thus any natural tendency to a diminution in the length\r\n    of the feet will have been counteracted. In the swallow and barb, when\r\n    the calculation was made on any standard of comparison excepting the\r\n    one above used (viz. length of body from base of beak to oil-gland),\r\n    the feet were found to be too small.\r\n\r\n    In the second table we have eight birds, with their beaks much longer\r\n    than in the rock-pigeon, both actually and proportionally with the size\r\n    of body, and their feet are in an equally marked manner longer, namely,\r\n    in proportion, on an average by .29 of an inch. I should here state\r\n    that in Table I. there are a few partial exceptions to the beak being\r\n    proportionally shorter than in the rock-pigeon: thus the beak of the\r\n    English frill-back is just perceptibly longer, and that of the Bussorah\r\n    carrier of the same length or slightly longer, than in the rock-pigeon.\r\n    The beaks of spots, swallows, and laughers are only a very little\r\n    shorter, or of the same proportional length, but slenderer.\r\n    Nevertheless, these two tables, taken conjointly, indicate pretty\r\n    plainly some kind of correlation between the length of the beak and the\r\n    size of the feet. Breeders of cattle and horses believe that there is\r\n    an analogous connection between the length of the limbs and head; they\r\n    assert that a race-horse with the head of a dray-horse, or a {174}\r\n    greyhound with the head of a bulldog, would be a monstrous production.\r\n    As fancy pigeons are generally kept in small aviaries, and are\r\n    abundantly supplied with food, they must walk about much less than the\r\n    wild rock-pigeon; and it may be admitted as highly probable that the\r\n    reduction in the size of the feet in the twenty-two birds in the first\r\n    table has been caused by disuse,[312] and that this reduction has acted\r\n    by correlation on the beaks of the great majority of the birds in Table\r\n    I. When, on the other hand, the beak has been much elongated by the\r\n    continued selection of successive slight increments of length, the feet\r\n    by correlation have likewise become much elongated in comparison with\r\n    those of the wild rock-pigeon, notwithstanding their lessened use.\r\n\r\n    As I had taken measures from the end of the middle toe to the heel of\r\n    the tarsus in the rock-pigeon and in the above thirty-six birds, I have\r\n    made calculations analogous with those above given, and the result is\r\n    the same,--namely, that in the short-beaked breeds, with equally few\r\n    exceptions as in the former case, the middle toe conjointly with the\r\n    tarsus has decreased in length; whereas in the long-beaked breeds it\r\n    has increased in length, though not quite so uniformly as in the former\r\n    case, for the leg in some varieties of the runt varies much in length.\r\n\r\n    As fancy pigeons are generally confined in aviaries of moderate size,\r\n    and as even when not confined they do not search for their own food,\r\n    they must during many generations have used their wings incomparably\r\n    less than the wild rock-pigeon. Hence it seemed to me probable that all\r\n    the parts of the skeleton subservient to flight would be found to be\r\n    reduced in size. With respect to the sternum, I have carefully measured\r\n    its extreme length in twelve birds of different breeds, and in two wild\r\n    rock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands. For the proportional comparison\r\n    I have tried with all twelve birds three standards of measurement,\r\n    namely, the length from the base of the beak to the oil-gland, to the\r\n    end of the tail, and from the extreme tip to tip of wings. The result\r\n    has been in each case nearly the same, the sternum being invariably\r\n    found to be shorter than in the wild rock-pigeon. I will give only a\r\n    single table, as calculated by the standard from the base of the beak\r\n    to the oil-gland; for the result in this case is nearly the mean\r\n    between the results obtained by the two other standards.\r\n\r\n_Length of Sternum._\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------------------+-------+------+\r\n  |                    |Actual | Too   |                   |Actual | Too  |\r\n  | Name of Breed.     |Length.| Short | Name of Breed.    |Length.| Short|\r\n  |                    |Inches.| by    |                   |Inches.| by   |\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------------------+-------+------+\r\n  | Wild Rock-pigeon   |  2.55 |  ..   | Barb              |  2.35 | 0.34 |\r\n  | Pied Scanderoon    |  2.80 | 0.60  | Nun               |  2.27 | 0.15 |\r\n  | Bagadotten Carrier |  2.80 | 0.17  | German Pouter     |  2.36 | 0.54 |\r\n  | Dragon             |  2.45 | 0.41  | Jacobin           |  2.33 | 0.22 |\r\n  | Carrier            |  2.75 | 0.35  | English Frill-back|  2.40 | 0.43 |\r\n  | Short-faced Tumbler|  2.05 | 0.28  | Swallow           |  2.45 | 0.17 |\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------------------+-------+------+\r\n\r\n{175}\r\n\r\n    This table shows that in these twelve breeds the sternum is on an\r\n    average one-third of an inch (exactly .332) shorter than in the\r\n    rock-pigeon, proportionally with the size of their bodies; so that the\r\n    sternum has been reduced by between one-seventh and one-eighth of its\r\n    entire length; and this is a considerable reduction.\r\n\r\n    I have also measured in twenty-one birds, including the above dozen,\r\n    the prominence of the crest of the sternum relatively to its length,\r\n    independently of the size of the body. In two of the twenty-one birds\r\n    the crest was prominent in the same relative degree as in the\r\n    rock-pigeon; in seven it was more prominent; but in five out of these\r\n    seven, namely, in a fantail, two scanderoons, and two English carriers,\r\n    this greater prominence may to a certain extent be explained, as a\r\n    prominent breast is admired and selected by fanciers; in the remaining\r\n    twelve birds the prominence was less. Hence it follows that the crest\r\n    exhibits a slight, though uncertain, tendency to become reduced in\r\n    prominence in a greater degree than does the length of the sternum\r\n    relatively to the size of body, in comparison with the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n    I have measured the length of the scapula in nine different large and\r\n    small-sized breeds, and in all the scapula is proportionally shorter\r\n    (taking the same standard as before) than in the wild rock-pigeon. The\r\n    reduction in length on an average is very nearly one-fifth of an inch,\r\n    or about one-ninth of the length of the scapula in the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n    The arms of the furcula in all the specimens which I compared, diverged\r\n    less, proportionally with the size of body, than in the rock-pigeon;\r\n    and the whole furcula was proportionally shorter. Thus in a runt, which\r\n    measured from tip to tip of wings 38½ inches, the furcula was only a\r\n    very little longer (with the arms hardly more divergent) than in a\r\n    rock-pigeon which measured from tip to tip 26½ inches. In a barb, which\r\n    in all its measurements was a little larger than the same rock-pigeon,\r\n    the furcula was a quarter of an inch shorter. In a pouter, the furcula\r\n    had not been lengthened proportionally with the increased length of the\r\n    body. In a short-faced tumbler, which measured from tip to tip of wings\r\n    24 inches, therefore only 2½ inches less than the rock-pigeon, the\r\n    furcula was barely two-thirds of the length of that of the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nWe thus clearly see that the sternum, scapulæ, and furcula are all reduced\r\nin proportional length; but when we turn to the wings we find what at first\r\nappears a wholly different and unexpected result. I may here remark that I\r\nhave not picked out specimens, but have used every measurement made by me.\r\nTaking the length from the base of beak to the end of the tail as the\r\nstandard of comparison, I find that, out of thirty-five birds of various\r\nbreeds, twenty-five have wings of greater, and ten have them of less\r\nproportional length, than in the rock-pigeon. But from the frequently\r\ncorrelated length of the tail and wing-feathers, it is better to take as\r\nthe standard {176} of comparison the length from the base of the beak to\r\nthe oil-gland; and by this standard, out of twenty-six of the same birds\r\nwhich had been thus measured, twenty-one had wings too long, and only five\r\nhad them too short. In the twenty-one birds the wings exceeded in length\r\nthose of the rock-pigeon, on an average, by 1-1/3 inch; whilst in the five\r\nbirds they were less in length by only .8 of an inch. As I was much\r\nsurprised that the wings of closely confined birds should thus so\r\nfrequently have been increased in length, it occurred to me that it might\r\nbe solely due to the greater length of the wing-feathers; for this\r\ncertainly is the case with the jacobin, which has wings of unusual length.\r\nAs in almost every case I had measured the folded wings, I subtracted the\r\nlength of this terminal part from that of the expanded wings, and thus I\r\nobtained, with a moderate degree of accuracy, the length of the wings from\r\nthe ends of the two radii, answering from wrist to wrist in our arms. The\r\nwings, thus measured in the same twenty-five birds, now gave a widely\r\ndifferent result; for they were proportionally with those of the\r\nrock-pigeon too short in seventeen birds, and in only eight too long. Of\r\nthese eight birds, five were long-beaked,[313] and this fact perhaps\r\nindicates that there is some correlation between the length of the beak and\r\nthe length of the bones of the wings, in the same manner as with the feet\r\nand tarsi. The shortening of the humerus and radius in the seventeen birds\r\nmay probably be attributed to disuse, as in the case of the scapulæ and\r\nfurcula to which the wing-bones are attached;--the lengthening of the\r\nwing-feathers, and consequently the expansion of the wings from tip to tip,\r\nbeing, on the other hand, as completely independent of use and disuse as is\r\nthe growth of the hair or wool on our long-haired dogs or long-woolled\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: we may confidently admit that the length of the sternum, and\r\nfrequently the prominence of its crest, the length of the scapulæ and\r\nfurcula, have all been reduced in size in comparison with the same parts in\r\nthe rock-pigeon. And I {177} presume that this may be safely attributed to\r\ndisuse or lessened exercise. The wings, as measured from the ends of the\r\nradii, have likewise been generally reduced in length; but, owing to the\r\nincreased growth of the wing-feathers, the wings, from tip to tip, are\r\ncommonly longer than in the rock-pigeon. The feet, as well as the tarsi\r\nconjointly with the middle toe, have likewise in most cases become reduced;\r\nand this it is probable has been caused by their lessened use; but the\r\nexistence of some sort of correlation between the feet and beak is shown\r\nmore plainly than the effects of disuse. We have also some faint indication\r\nof a similar correlation between the main bones of the wing and the beak.\r\n\r\n_Summary on the Points of Difference between the several Domestic Races,\r\nand between the individual Birds._--The beak, together with the bones of\r\nthe face, differ remarkably in length, breadth, shape, and curvature. The\r\nskull differs in shape, and greatly in the angle formed by the union of the\r\npremaxillary, nasal, and maxillo-jugal bones. The curvature of the lower\r\njaw and the reflexion of its upper margin, as well as the gape of the\r\nmouth, differ in a highly remarkable manner. The tongue varies much in\r\nlength, both independently and in correlation with the length of the beak.\r\nThe development of the naked, wattled skin over the nostrils and round the\r\neyes varies in an extreme degree. The eyelids and the external orifices of\r\nthe nostrils vary in length, and are to a certain extent correlated with\r\nthe degree of development of the wattle. The size and form of the\r\noesophagus and crop, and their capacity for inflation, differ immensely.\r\nThe length of the neck varies. With the varying shape of the body, the\r\nbreadth and number of the ribs, the presence of processes, the number of\r\nthe sacral vertebræ, and the length of the sternum, all vary. The number\r\nand size of the coccygeal vertebræ vary, apparently in correlation with the\r\nincreased size of the tail. The size and shape of the perforations in the\r\nsternum, and the size and divergence of the arms of the furcula, differ.\r\nThe oil-gland varies in development, and is sometimes quite aborted. The\r\ndirection and length of certain feathers have been much modified, as in the\r\nhood of the Jacobin and the frill of the Turbit. The wing and tail feathers\r\ngenerally vary in {178} length together, but sometimes independently of\r\neach other and of the size of the body. The number and position of the\r\ntail-feathers vary to an unparalleled degree. The primary and secondary\r\nwing-feathers occasionally vary in number, apparently in correlation with\r\nthe length of the wing. The length of the leg and the size of the feet,\r\nand, in connection with the latter, the number of the scutellæ, all vary. A\r\nweb of skin sometimes connects the bases of the two inner toes, and almost\r\ninvariably the two outer toes when the feet are feathered.\r\n\r\nThe size of the body differs greatly: a runt has been known to weigh more\r\nthan five times as much as a short-faced tumbler. The eggs differ in size\r\nand shape. According to Parmentier,[314] some races use much straw in\r\nbuilding their nests, and others use little; but I cannot hear of any\r\nrecent corroboration of this statement. The length of time required for\r\nhatching the eggs is uniform in all the breeds. The period at which the\r\ncharacteristic plumage of some breeds is acquired, and at which certain\r\nchanges of colour supervene, differs. The degree to which the young birds\r\nare clothed with down when first hatched is different, and is correlated in\r\na singular manner with the future colour of the plumage. The manner of\r\nflight, and certain inherited movements, such as clapping the wings,\r\ntumbling either in the air or on the ground, and the manner of courting the\r\nfemale, present the most singular differences. In disposition the several\r\nraces differ. Some races are very silent; others coo in a highly peculiar\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nAlthough many different races have kept true in character during several\r\ncenturies, as we shall hereafter more fully see, yet there is far more\r\nindividual variability in the truest breeds than in birds in a state of\r\nnature. There is hardly any exception to the rule that those characters\r\nvary most which are now most valued and attended to by fanciers, and which\r\nconsequently are now being improved by continued selection. This is\r\nindirectly admitted by fanciers when they complain that it is much more\r\ndifficult to breed high fancy pigeons up to the proper standard of\r\nexcellence than the so-called toy pigeons, which differ from {179} each\r\nother merely in colour; for particular colours when once acquired are not\r\nliable to continued improvement or augmentation. Some characters become\r\nattached, from quite unknown causes, more strongly to the male than to the\r\nfemale sex; so that we have, in certain races, a tendency towards the\r\nappearance of secondary sexual characters,[315] of which the aboriginal\r\nrock-pigeon displays not a trace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{180}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPIGEONS--_continued_.\r\n\r\n    ON THE ABORIGINAL PARENT-STOCK OF THE SEVERAL DOMESTIC RACES--HABITS OF\r\n    LIFE--WILD RACES OF THE ROCK-PIGEON--DOVECOT-PIGEONS--PROOFS OF THE\r\n    DESCENT OF THE SEVERAL RACES FROM COLUMBA LIVIA--FERTILITY OF THE RACES\r\n    WHEN CROSSED--REVERSION TO THE PLUMAGE OF THE WILD\r\n    ROCK-PIGEON--CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO THE FORMATION OF THE\r\n    RACES--ANTIQUITY AND HISTORY OF THE PRINCIPAL RACES--MANNER OF THEIR\r\n    FORMATION--SELECTION--UNCONSCIOUS SELECTION--CARE TAKEN BY FANCIERS IN\r\n    SELECTING THEIR BIRDS--SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STRAINS GRADUALLY CHANGE INTO\r\n    WELL-MARKED BREEDS--EXTINCTION OF INTERMEDIATE FORMS--CERTAIN BREEDS\r\n    REMAIN PERMANENT, WHILST OTHERS CHANGE--SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nThe differences described in the last chapter between the eleven chief\r\ndomestic races and between individual birds of the same race, would be of\r\nlittle significance, if they had not all descended from a single wild\r\nstock. The question of their origin is therefore of fundamental importance,\r\nand must be discussed at considerable length. No one will think this\r\nsuperfluous who considers the great amount of difference between the races,\r\nwho knows how ancient many of them are, and how truly they breed at the\r\npresent day. Fanciers almost unanimously believe that the different races\r\nare descended from several wild stocks, whereas most naturalists believe\r\nthat all are descended from the _Columba livia_ or rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nTemminck[316] has well observed, and Mr. Gould has made the same remark to\r\nme, that the aboriginal parent must have been a species which roosted and\r\nbuilt its nest on rocks; and I may add that it must have been a social\r\nbird. For all the domestic races are highly social, and none are known to\r\nbuild or habitually to roost on trees. The awkward manner in which some\r\npigeons, kept by me in a summer-house near an old walnut-tree, occasionally\r\nalighted on the barer branches, was {181} evident.[317] Nevertheless, Mr.\r\nR. Scot Skirving informs me that he often saw crowds of pigeons in Upper\r\nEgypt settling on the low trees, but not on the palms, in preference to the\r\nmud hovels of the natives. In India Mr. Blyth[318] has been assured that\r\nthe wild _C. livia_, var. _intermedia_, sometimes roosts in trees. I may\r\nhere give a curious instance of compulsion leading to changed habits: the\r\nbanks of the Nile above lat. 28° 30' are perpendicular for a long distance,\r\nso that when the river is full the pigeons cannot alight on the shore to\r\ndrink, and Mr. Skirving repeatedly saw whole flocks settle on the water,\r\nand drink whilst they floated down the stream. These flocks seen from a\r\ndistance resembled flocks of gulls on the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nIf any domestic race had descended from a species which was not social, or\r\nwhich built its nest or roosted in trees,[319] the sharp eyes of fanciers\r\nwould assuredly have detected some vestige of so different an aboriginal\r\nhabit. For we have reason to believe that aboriginal habits are long\r\nretained under domestication. Thus with the common ass we see signs of its\r\noriginal desert life in its strong dislike to cross the smallest stream of\r\nwater, and in its pleasure in rolling in the dust. The same strong dislike\r\nto cross a stream is common to the camel, which has been domesticated from\r\na very ancient period. Young pigs, though so tame, sometimes squat when\r\nfrightened, and thus try to conceal themselves even on an open and bare\r\nplace. Young turkeys, and occasionally even young fowls, when the hen gives\r\nthe danger-cry, run away and try to hide themselves, like young partridges\r\nor pheasants, in order that their mother may take flight, of which she has\r\nlost the power. The musk-duck (_Dendrocygna viduata_) in its native {182}\r\ncountry often perches and roosts on trees,[320] and our domesticated\r\nmusk-ducks, though such sluggish birds, \"are fond of perching on the tops\r\nof barns, walls, &c., and, if allowed to spend the night in the hen-house,\r\nthe female will generally go to roost by the side of the hens, but the\r\ndrake is too heavy to mount thither with ease.\"[321] We know that the dog,\r\nhowever well and regularly fed, often buries, like the fox, any superfluous\r\nfood; and we see him turning round and round on a carpet, as if to trample\r\ndown grass to form a bed; we see him on bare pavements scratching backwards\r\nas if to throw earth over his excrement, although, as I believe, this is\r\nnever effected even where there is earth. In the delight with which lambs\r\nand kids crowd together and frisk on the smallest hillock, we see a vestige\r\nof their former alpine habits.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore good reason to believe that all the domestic races of the\r\npigeon are descended either from some one or from several species which\r\nboth roosted and built their nests on rocks, and were social in\r\ndisposition. As only five or six wild species with these habits and making\r\nany near approach in structure to the domesticated pigeon are known to\r\nexist, I will enumerate them.\r\n\r\n    Firstly, the _Columba leuconota_ resembles certain domestic varieties\r\n    in its plumage, with the one marked and never-failing difference of a\r\n    white band which crosses the tail at some distance from the extremity.\r\n    This species, moreover, inhabits the Himalaya, close to the limit of\r\n    perpetual snow; and therefore, as Mr. Blyth has remarked, is not likely\r\n    to have been the parent of our domestic breeds, which thrive in the\r\n    hottest countries. Secondly, the _C. rupestris_, of Central Asia, which\r\n    is intermediate[322] between the _C. leuconota_ and _livia_; but has\r\n    nearly the same coloured tail with the former species. Thirdly, the\r\n    _Columba littoralis_ builds and roosts, according to Temminck, on rocks\r\n    in the Malayan archipelago; it is white, excepting parts of the wing\r\n    and the tip of the tail, which are black; its legs are livid-coloured,\r\n    and this is a character not observed in any adult domestic pigeon; but\r\n    I need not have mentioned this species or the closely-allied _C.\r\n    luctuosa_, as they in fact belong to the genus Carpophaga. Fourthly,\r\n    _Columba Guinea_, which ranges from Guinea[323] to the Cape of Good\r\n    Hope, {183} and roosts either on trees or rocks, according to the\r\n    nature of the country. This species belongs to the genus Strictoenas of\r\n    Reichenbach, but is closely allied to true Columba; it is to some\r\n    extent coloured like certain domestic races, and has been said to be\r\n    domesticated in Abyssinia; but Mr. Mansfield Parkyns, who collected the\r\n    birds of that country and knows the species, informs me that this is a\r\n    mistake. Moreover the _C. Guinea_ is characterized by the feathers of\r\n    the neck having peculiar notched tips,--a character not observed in any\r\n    domestic race. Fifthly, the _Columba oenas_ of Europe, which roosts on\r\n    trees, and builds its nest in holes, either in trees or the ground;\r\n    this species, as far as external characters go, might be the parent of\r\n    several domestic races; but, though it crosses readily with the true\r\n    rock-pigeon, the offspring, as we shall presently see, are sterile\r\n    hybrids, and of such sterility there is not a trace when the domestic\r\n    races are intercrossed. It should also be observed that if we were to\r\n    admit, against all probability, that any of the foregoing five or six\r\n    species were the parents of some of our domestic pigeons, not the least\r\n    light would be thrown on the chief differences between the eleven most\r\n    strongly-marked races.\r\n\r\n    We now come to the best known rock-pigeon, the _Columba livia_, which\r\n    is often designated in Europe pre-eminently as the Rock-pigeon, and\r\n    which naturalists believe to be the parent of all the domesticated\r\n    breeds. This bird agrees in every essential character with the breeds\r\n    which have been only slightly modified. It differs from all other\r\n    species in being of a slaty-blue colour, with two black bars on the\r\n    wings, and with the croup (or loins) white. Occasionally birds are seen\r\n    in Faroe and the Hebrides with the black bars replaced by two or three\r\n    black spots; this form has been named by Brehm[324] _C. amaliæ_, but\r\n    this species has not been admitted as distinct by other ornithologists.\r\n    Graba[325] even found a difference between the wing-bars of the same\r\n    bird in Faroe. Another and rather more distinct form is either truly\r\n    wild or has become feral on the cliffs of England, and was doubtfully\r\n    named by Mr. Blyth[326] as _C. affinis_, but is now no longer\r\n    considered by him as a distinct species. _C. affinis_ is rather smaller\r\n    than the rock-pigeon of the Scottish islands, and has a very different\r\n    appearance owing to the wing-coverts being chequered with black, with\r\n    similar marks often extending over the back. The chequering consists of\r\n    a large black spot on the two sides, but chiefly on the outer side, of\r\n    each feather. The wing-bars in the true rock-pigeon and in the\r\n    chequered variety are, in fact, due to similar though larger spots\r\n    symmetrically crossing the secondary wing-feather and the larger\r\n    coverts. Hence the chequering arises merely from an extension of these\r\n    marks to other parts of the plumage. Chequered birds are not confined\r\n    to the coasts of England; for {184} they were found by Graba at Faroe;\r\n    and W. Thompson[327] says that at Islay fully half the wild\r\n    rock-pigeons were chequered. Colonel King, of Hythe, stocked his\r\n    dovecot with young wild birds which he himself procured from nests at\r\n    the Orkney Islands; and several specimens, kindly sent to me by him,\r\n    were all plainly chequered. As we thus see that chequered birds occur\r\n    mingled with the true rock-pigeon at three distinct sites, namely,\r\n    Faroe, the Orkney Islands, and Islay, no importance can be attached to\r\n    this natural variation in the plumage.\r\n\r\n    Prince C. L. Bonaparte,[328] a great divider of species, enumerates,\r\n    with a mark of interrogation, as distinct from _C. livia_, the _C.\r\n    turricola_ of Italy, the _C. rupestris_ of Daouria, and the _C.\r\n    Schimperi_ of Abyssinia; but these birds differ from _C. livia_ in\r\n    characters of the most trifling value. In the British Museum there is a\r\n    chequered pigeon, probably the _C. Schimperi_ of Bonaparte, from\r\n    Abyssinia. To these may be added the _C. gymnocyclus_ of G. R. Gray\r\n    from W. Africa, which is slightly more distinct, and has rather more\r\n    naked skin round the eyes than the rock-pigeon; but from information\r\n    given me by Dr. Daniell, it is doubtful whether this is a wild bird,\r\n    for dovecot-pigeons (which I have examined) are kept on the coast of\r\n    Guinea.\r\n\r\n    The wild rock-pigeon of India _(C. intermedia_ of Strickland) has been\r\n    more generally accepted as a distinct species. It chiefly differs in\r\n    the croup being blue instead of snow-white; but as Mr. Blyth informs\r\n    me, the tint varies, being sometimes albescent. When this form is\r\n    domesticated chequered birds appear, just as occurs in Europe with the\r\n    truly wild _C. livia_. Moreover we shall immediately have proof that\r\n    the blue and white croup is a highly variable character; and\r\n    Bechstein[329] asserts that with dovecot-pigeons in Germany this is the\r\n    most variable of all the characters of the plumage. Hence it may be\r\n    concluded that _C. intermedia_ cannot be ranked as specifically\r\n    distinct from _C. livia_.\r\n\r\n    In Madeira there is a rock-pigeon which a few ornithologists have\r\n    suspected to be distinct from _C. livia_. I have examined numerous\r\n    specimens collected by Mr. E. V. Harcourt and Mr. Mason. They are\r\n    rather smaller than the rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands, and\r\n    their beaks are plainly thinner; but the thickness of the beak varied\r\n    in the several specimens. In plumage there is remarkable diversity;\r\n    some specimens are identical in every feather (I speak after actual\r\n    comparison) with the rock-pigeon of the Shetland Islands; others are\r\n    chequered, like _C. affinis_ from the cliffs of England, but generally\r\n    to a greater degree, being almost black over the whole back; others are\r\n    identical with the so-called _C. intermedia_ of India in the degree of\r\n    blueness of the croup; whilst others have this part very pale or very\r\n    dark blue, and are likewise chequered. So much variability raises a\r\n    strong suspicion that these birds are domestic pigeons which have\r\n    become feral.\r\n\r\n    {185}\r\n\r\n    From these facts it can hardly be doubted that _C. livia_, _affinis_,\r\n    _intermedia_, and the forms marked with an interrogation by Bonaparte,\r\n    ought all to be included under a single species. But it is quite\r\n    immaterial whether or not they are thus ranked, and whether some one of\r\n    these forms or all are the progenitors of the various domestic kinds,\r\n    as far as any light is thus thrown on the differences between the more\r\n    strongly-marked races. That common dovecot-pigeons, which are kept in\r\n    various parts of the world, are descended from one or from several of\r\n    the above-mentioned wild varieties of _C. livia_, no one who compares\r\n    them will doubt. But before making a few remarks on dovecot-pigeons, it\r\n    should be stated that the wild rock-pigeon has been found easy to tame\r\n    in several countries. We have seen that Colonel King at Hythe stocked\r\n    his dovecot more than twenty years ago with young wild birds taken at\r\n    the Orkney Islands, and since this time they have greatly multiplied.\r\n    The accurate Macgillivray[330] asserts that he completely tamed a wild\r\n    rock-pigeon in the Hebrides; and several accounts are on record of\r\n    these pigeons having bred in dovecots in the Shetland Islands. In\r\n    India, as Captain Hutton informs me, the wild rock-pigeon is easily\r\n    tamed, and breeds readily with the domestic kind; and Mr. Blyth[331]\r\n    asserts that wild birds come frequently to the dovecots and mingle\r\n    freely with their inhabitants. In the ancient 'Ayeen Akbery' it is\r\n    written that, if a few wild pigeons be taken, \"they are speedily joined\r\n    by a thousand others of their kind.\"\r\n\r\n    Dovecot-pigeons are those which are kept in dovecots in a\r\n    semi-domesticated state; for no special care is taken of them, and they\r\n    procure their own food, except during the severest weather. In England,\r\n    and, judging from MM. Boitard and Corbié's work, in France, the common\r\n    dovecot-pigeon exactly resembles the chequered variety of _C. livia_;\r\n    but I have seen dovecots brought from Yorkshire, without any trace of\r\n    chequering, like the wild rock-pigeon of the Shetland Islands. The\r\n    chequered dovecots from the Orkney Islands, after having been\r\n    domesticated by Colonel King for more than twenty years, differed\r\n    slightly from each other in the darkness of their plumage, and in the\r\n    thickness of their beaks; the thinnest beak being rather thicker than\r\n    the thickest one in the Madeira birds. In Germany, according to\r\n    Bechstein, the common dovecot-pigeon is not chequered. In India they\r\n    often become chequered, and sometimes pied with white; the croup also,\r\n    as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, becomes nearly white. I have received\r\n    from Sir J. Brooke some dovecot-pigeons, {186} which originally came\r\n    from the S. Natunas Islands in the Malay archipelago, and which had\r\n    been crossed with the Singapore dovecots; they were small, and the\r\n    darkest variety was extremely like the dark chequered variety with a\r\n    blue croup from Madeira; but the beak was not so thin, though decidedly\r\n    thinner than in the rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands. A\r\n    dovecot-pigeon sent to me by Mr. Swinhoe from Foochow, in China, was\r\n    likewise rather small, but differed in no other respect. I have also\r\n    received, through the kindness of Dr. Daniell, four living\r\n    dovecot-pigeons from Sierra Leone;[332] these were fully as large as\r\n    the Shetland rock-pigeon, with even bulkier bodies. In plumage some of\r\n    them were identical with the Shetland rock-pigeon, but with the\r\n    metallic tints apparently rather more brilliant; others had a blue\r\n    croup and resembled the chequered variety of _C. intermedia_ of India;\r\n    and some were so much chequered as to be nearly black. In these four\r\n    birds the beak differed slightly in length, but in all it was decidedly\r\n    shorter, more massive, and stronger than in the wild rock-pigeon from\r\n    the Shetland Islands, or in the English dovecot. When the beaks of\r\n    these African pigeons were compared with the thinnest beaks of the wild\r\n    Madeira specimens, the contrast was great; the former being fully\r\n    one-third thicker in a vertical direction than the latter; so that any\r\n    one at first would have felt inclined to rank these birds as\r\n    specifically distinct; yet-so perfectly graduated a series could be\r\n    formed between the above-mentioned varieties, that it was obviously\r\n    impossible to separate them.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the wild _Columba livia_, including under this name _C. affinis,\r\nintermedia_, and the other still more closely-affined geographical races,\r\nhas a vast range from the southern coast of Norway and the Faroe Islands to\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean, to Madeira and the Canary Islands, to\r\nAbyssinia, India, and Japan. It varies greatly in plumage, being in many\r\nplaces chequered with black, and having either a white or blue croup or\r\nloins: it varies also slightly in the size of the beak and body.\r\nDovecot-pigeons, which no one disputes are descended from one or more of\r\nthe above wild forms, present a similar but greater range of variation in\r\nplumage, in the size of body, and in the length and thickness of the beak.\r\nThere seems to be some relation between the croup being blue or white, and\r\nthe temperature of the country inhabited by both wild and dovecot pigeons;\r\nfor nearly all the dovecot-pigeons in the northern parts of Europe have a\r\nwhite croup, like that of the wild European {187} rock-pigeon; and nearly\r\nall the dovecot-pigeons of India have a blue croup like that of the wild\r\n_C. intermedia_ of India. As in various countries the wild rock-pigeon has\r\nbeen found easy to tame, it seems extremely probable that the\r\ndovecot-pigeons throughout the world are the descendants of at least two\r\nand perhaps more wild stocks, but these, as we have just seen, cannot be\r\nranked as specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the variation of _C. livia_, we may without fear of\r\ncontradiction go one step further. Those pigeon-fanciers who believe that\r\nall the chief races, such as Carriers, Pouters, Fantails, &c., are\r\ndescended from distinct aboriginal stocks, yet admit that the so-called\r\ntoy-pigeons, which differ from the rock-pigeon in little except in colour,\r\nare descended from this bird. By toy-pigeons are meant such birds as Spots,\r\nNuns, Helmets, Swallows, Priests, Monks, Porcelains, Swabians, Archangels,\r\nBreasts, Shields, and others in Europe, and many others in India. It would\r\nindeed be as puerile to suppose that all these birds are descended from so\r\nmany distinct wild stocks as to suppose this to be the case with the many\r\nvarieties of the gooseberry, heartsease, or dahlia. Yet these pigeons all\r\nbreed true, and many of them present sub-varieties which likewise truly\r\ntransmit their character. They differ greatly from each other and from the\r\nrock-pigeon in plumage, slightly in size and proportions of body, in size\r\nof feet, and in the length and thickness of their beaks. They differ from\r\neach other in these respects more than do dovecot-pigeons. Although we may\r\nsafely admit that the latter, which vary slightly, and that the\r\ntoy-pigeons, which vary in a greater degree in accordance with their more\r\nhighly-domesticated condition, are descended from _C. livia_, including\r\nunder this name the above-enumerated wild geographical races; yet the\r\nquestion becomes far more difficult when we consider the eleven principal\r\nraces, most of which have been so profoundly modified. It can, however, be\r\nshown, by indirect evidence of a perfectly conclusive nature, that these\r\nprincipal races are not descended from so many wild stocks; and if this be\r\nonce admitted, few will dispute that they are the descendants of _C.\r\nlivia_, which agrees with them so closely in habits and in most characters,\r\nwhich varies in a state of nature, and which has certainly {188} undergone\r\na considerable amount of variation, as in the toy-pigeons. We shall\r\nmoreover presently see how eminently favourable circumstances have been for\r\na great amount of modification in the more carefully tended breeds.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for concluding that the several principal races have not\r\ndescended from so many aboriginal and unknown stocks may be grouped under\r\nthe following six heads:--_Firstly_, if the eleven chief races have not\r\narisen from the variation of some one species, together with its\r\ngeographical races, they must be descended from several extremely distinct\r\naboriginal species; for no amount of crossing between only six or seven\r\nwild forms could produce races so distinct as pouters, carriers, runts,\r\nfantails, turbits, short-faced tumblers, jacobins, and trumpeters. How\r\ncould crossing produce, for instance, a pouter or a fantail, unless the two\r\nsupposed aboriginal parents possessed the remarkable characters of these\r\nbreeds? I am aware that some naturalists, following Pallas, believe that\r\ncrossing gives a strong tendency to variation, independently of the\r\ncharacters inherited from either parent. They believe that it would be\r\neasier to raise a pouter or fantail pigeon from crossing two distinct\r\nspecies, neither of which possessed the characters of these races, than\r\nfrom any single species. I can find few facts in support of this doctrine,\r\nand believe in it only to a limited degree; but in a future chapter I shall\r\nhave to recur to this subject. For our present purpose the point is not\r\nmaterial. The question which concerns us is, whether or not many new and\r\nimportant characters have arisen since man first domesticated the pigeon.\r\nOn the ordinary view, variability is due to changed conditions of life; on\r\nthe Pallasian doctrine, variability, or the appearance of new characters,\r\nis due to some mysterious effect from the crossing of two species, neither\r\nof which possess the characters in question. In some few instances it is\r\ncredible, though for several reasons not probable, that well-marked races\r\nhave been formed by crossing; for instance, a barb might perhaps have been\r\nformed by a cross between a long-beaked carrier, having large eye-wattles,\r\nand some short-beaked pigeon. That many races have been in some degree\r\nmodified by crossing, and that certain varieties which are distinguished\r\nonly by peculiar tints have arisen from crosses between\r\ndifferently-coloured {189} varieties, may be admitted as almost certain. On\r\nthe doctrine, therefore, that the chief races owe their differences to\r\ntheir descent from distinct species, we must admit that at least eight or\r\nnine, or more probably a dozen species, all having the same habit of\r\nbreeding and roosting on rocks and living in society, either now exist\r\nsomewhere, or formerly existed but have become extinct as wild birds.\r\nConsidering how carefully wild pigeons have been collected throughout the\r\nworld, and what conspicuous birds they are, especially when frequenting\r\nrocks, it is extremely improbable that eight or nine species, which were\r\nlong ago domesticated and therefore must have inhabited some anciently\r\nknown country, should still exist in the wild state and be unknown to\r\nornithologists.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that such species formerly existed, but have become extinct,\r\nis in some slight degree more probable. But the extinction of so many\r\nspecies within the historical period is a bold hypothesis, seeing how\r\nlittle influence man has had in exterminating the common rock-pigeon, which\r\nagrees in all its habits of life with the domestic races. The _C. livia_\r\nnow exists and flourishes on the small northern islands of Faroe, on many\r\nislands off the coast of Scotland, on Sardinia and the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and in the centre of India. Fanciers have sometimes imagined\r\nthat the several supposed parent-species were originally confined to small\r\nislands, and thus might readily have been exterminated; but the facts just\r\ngiven do not favour the probability of their extinction, even on small\r\nislands. Nor is it probable, from what is known of the distribution of\r\nbirds, that the islands near Europe should have been inhabited by peculiar\r\nspecies of pigeons; and if we assume that distant oceanic islands were the\r\nhomes of the supposed parent-species, we must remember that ancient voyages\r\nwere tediously slow, and that ships were then ill-provided with fresh food,\r\nso that it would not have been easy to bring home living birds. I have said\r\nancient voyages, for nearly all the races of the pigeon were known before\r\nthe year 1600, so that the supposed wild species must have been captured\r\nand domesticated before that date.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._--The doctrine that the chief domestic races have descended from\r\nseveral aboriginal species, implies that several {190} species were\r\nformerly so thoroughly domesticated as to breed readily when confined.\r\nAlthough it is easy to tame most wild birds, experience shows us that it is\r\ndifficult to get them to breed freely under confinement; although it must\r\nbe owned that this is less difficult with pigeons than with most other\r\nbirds. During the last two or three hundred years, many birds have been\r\nkept in aviaries, but hardly one has been added to our list of thoroughly\r\nreclaimed species; yet on the above doctrine we must admit that in ancient\r\ntimes nearly a dozen kinds of pigeons, now unknown in the wild state, were\r\nthoroughly domesticated.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._--Most of our domesticated animals have run wild in various parts\r\nof the world; but birds, owing apparently to their partial loss of the\r\npower of flight, less often than quadrupeds. Nevertheless I have met with\r\naccounts showing that the common fowl has become feral in South America and\r\nperhaps in West Africa, and on several islands: the turkey was at one time\r\nalmost feral on the banks of the Parana; and the Guinea-fowl has become\r\nperfectly wild at Ascension and in Jamaica. In this latter island the\r\npeacock, also, \"has become a maroon bird.\" The common duck wanders from its\r\nhome and becomes almost wild in Norfolk. Hybrids between the common and\r\nmusk-duck which have become wild have been shot in North America, Belgium,\r\nand near the Caspian Sea. The goose is said to have run wild in La Plata.\r\nThe common dovecot-pigeon has become wild at Juan Fernandez, Norfolk\r\nIsland, Ascension, probably at Madeira, on the shores of Scotland, and, as\r\nis asserted, on the banks of the Hudson in North America.[333] But how\r\ndifferent is the case, when we turn {191} to the eleven chief domestic\r\nraces of the pigeon, which are supposed by some authors to be descended\r\nfrom so many distinct species! no one has ever pretended that any one of\r\nthese races has been found wild in any quarter of the world; yet they have\r\nbeen transported to all countries, and some of them must have been carried\r\nback to their native homes. On the view that all the races are the product\r\nof variation, we can understand why they have not become feral, for the\r\ngreat amount of modification which they have undergone shows how long and\r\nhow thoroughly they have been domesticated; and this would unfit them for a\r\nwild life.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._--If it be assumed that the characteristic differences between\r\nthe various domestic races are due to descent from several aboriginal\r\nspecies, we must conclude that man chose for domestication in ancient\r\ntimes, either intentionally or by chance, a most abnormal set of pigeons;\r\nfor that species resembling such birds as pouters, fantails, carriers,\r\nbarbs, short-faced tumblers, turbits, &c., would be in the highest degree\r\nabnormal, as compared with all the existing members of the great\r\npigeon-family, cannot be doubted. Thus we should have to believe that man\r\nnot only formerly succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several highly\r\nabnormal species, but that these same species have since all become\r\nextinct, or are at least now unknown. This double accident is so extremely\r\nimprobable that the assumed existence of so many abnormal species would\r\nrequire to be supported by the strongest evidence. On the other hand, if\r\nall the races are descended from _C. livia_, we can understand, as will\r\nhereafter be more fully explained, how any slight deviation in structure\r\nwhich first appeared would continually be augmented by the preservation of\r\nthe most strongly marked individuals; and as the power of selection would\r\nbe applied according to man's fancy, and not for the bird's own good, the\r\naccumulated amount of deviation would certainly be of an abnormal nature in\r\ncomparison with the structure of pigeons living in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the remarkable fact, that the {192}\r\ncharacteristic differences between the chief domestic races are eminently\r\nvariable: we see this plainly in the great difference in the number of the\r\ntail-feathers in the fantail, in the development of the crop in pouters, in\r\nthe length of the beak in tumblers, in the state of the wattle in carriers,\r\n&c. If these characters are the result of successive variations added\r\ntogether by selection, we can understand why they should be so variable:\r\nfor these are the very parts which have varied since the domestication of\r\nthe pigeon, and therefore would be likely still to vary; these variations\r\nmoreover have been recently, and are still being accumulated by man's\r\nselection; therefore they have not as yet become firmly fixed.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly._--All the domestic races pair readily together, and, what is\r\nequally important, their mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile. To\r\nascertain this fact I made many experiments, which are given in the note\r\nbelow; and recently Mr. Tegetmeier has made similar experiments with the\r\nsame result.[334] The accurate Neumeister[335] asserts that when dovecots\r\n{193} are crossed with pigeons of any other breed, the mongrels are\r\nextremely fertile and hardy. MM. Boitard and Corbié[336] affirm, after\r\ntheir great experience, that with crossed pigeons the more distinct the\r\nbreeds, the more productive are their mongrel offspring. I admit that the\r\ndoctrine first broached by Pallas is highly probable, if not actually\r\nproved, namely, that closely allied species, which in a state of nature or\r\nwhen first captured would have been in some degree sterile when crossed,\r\nlose this sterility after a long course of domestication; yet when we\r\nconsider the great difference between such races as pouters, carriers,\r\nrunts, fantails, turbits, tumblers, &c., the fact of their perfect, or even\r\nincreased, fertility when intercrossed in the most complicated manner\r\nbecomes a strong argument in favour of their having all descended from a\r\nsingle species. This argument is rendered much stronger when we hear (I\r\nappend in a note[337] {194} all the cases which I have collected) that\r\nhardly a single well-ascertained instance is known of hybrids between two\r\ntrue species of pigeons being fertile, _inter se_, or even when crossed\r\nwith one of their pure parents.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly._--Excluding certain important characteristic differences, the\r\nchief races agree most closely both with each other and with _C. livia_ in\r\nall other respects. As previously observed, all are eminently sociable; all\r\ndislike to perch or roost, and refuse to build in trees; all lay two eggs,\r\nand this is not a universal rule with the Columbidæ; all, as far as I can\r\nhear, require the same time for hatching their eggs; all can endure the\r\nsame great range of climate; all prefer the same food, and are passionately\r\nfond of salt; all exhibit (with the asserted exception of the finnikin and\r\nturner, which do not differ much in any other character) the same peculiar\r\ngestures when courting the females; and all (with the exception of\r\ntrumpeters and laughers, which likewise do not differ much in any other\r\ncharacter) coo in the same peculiar manner, unlike the voice of any other\r\nwild pigeon. All the coloured breeds display the same peculiar metallic\r\ntints on the breast, a character far from general with pigeons. Each race\r\npresents nearly the same range of variation in colour; and in most of the\r\nraces we have the same singular correlation between the development of down\r\nin the young and the future colour of plumage. All have the proportional\r\nlength of their toes, and of their primary wing-feathers, nearly the\r\nsame,--characters which are apt to differ in the several members of the\r\nColumbidæ. In those races which present some remarkable deviation of\r\nstructure, such as in the tail of fantails, crop of pouters, beak of\r\ncarriers and tumblers, &c., the other parts remain nearly unaltered. Now\r\nevery naturalist will admit that it would be scarcely possible to pick out\r\na dozen natural species in any Family, which should agree closely in habits\r\nand in general structure, and yet should differ greatly in a few {195}\r\ncharacters alone. This fact is explicable through the doctrine of natural\r\nselection; for each successive modification of structure in each natural\r\nspecies is preserved, solely because it is of service; and such\r\nmodifications when largely accumulated imply a great change in the habits\r\nof life, and this will almost certainly lead to other changes of structure\r\nthroughout the whole organisation. On the other hand, if the several races\r\nof the pigeon have been produced by man through selection and variation, we\r\ncan readily understand how it is that they should still all resemble each\r\nother in habits and in those many characters which man has not cared to\r\nmodify, whilst they differ to so prodigious a degree in those parts which\r\nhave struck his eye or pleased his fancy.\r\n\r\nBesides the points above enumerated, in which all the domestic races\r\nresemble _C. livia_ and each other, there is one which deserves special\r\nnotice. The wild rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue colour; the wings are\r\ncrossed by two black bars; the croup varies in colour, being generally\r\nwhite in the pigeon of Europe, and blue in that of India; the tail has a\r\nblack bar close to the end, and the outer webs of the outer tail-feathers\r\nare edged with white, except near the tips. These combined characters are\r\nnot found in any wild pigeon besides _C. livia_. I have looked carefully\r\nthrough the great collection of pigeons in the British Museum, and I find\r\nthat a dark bar at the end of the tail is common; that the white edging to\r\nthe outer tail-feathers is not rare; but that the white croup is extremely\r\nrare, and the two black bars on the wings occur in no other pigeon,\r\nexcepting the alpine _C. leuconota_ and _C. rupestris_ of Asia. Now if we\r\nturn to the domestic races, it is highly remarkable, as an eminent fancier,\r\nMr. Wicking, observed to me, that, whenever a blue bird appears in any\r\nrace, the wings almost invariably show the double black bars.[338] The\r\nprimary wing-feathers may be white or black, and the whole body may be\r\n{196} of any colour, but if the wing-coverts alone are blue, the two black\r\nbars surely appear. I have myself seen, or acquired trustworthy evidence,\r\nas given below,[339] of blue birds with black bars on the wing, with the\r\ncroup either white or very pale or dark blue, with the tail having a\r\nterminal black bar, and with the outer feathers externally edged with white\r\nor very pale coloured, in the following races, which, as I carefully\r\nobserved in each case, appeared to be perfectly pure: namely, in Pouters,\r\nFantails, Tumblers, Jacobins, Turbits, Barbs, Carriers, Runts of three\r\ndistinct varieties, Trumpeters, Swallows, and in many other toy-pigeons,\r\nwhich, as being closely allied to _C. livia_, are not worth enumerating.\r\nThus we see that, in purely-bred races of every kind known in Europe, blue\r\nbirds occasionally appear having all the marks which characterise _C.\r\nlivia_, and which concur in no other wild species. Mr. Blyth, also, has\r\nmade the same observation with respect to the various domestic races known\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nCertain variations in the plumage are equally common in the wild _C.\r\nlivia_, in dovecot-pigeons, and in all the most highly modified races.\r\nThus, in all, the croup varies from white to {197} blue, being most\r\nfrequently white in Europe, and very generally blue in India.[340] We have\r\nseen that the wild _C. livia_ in Europe, and dovecots in all parts of the\r\nworld, often have the upper wing-coverts chequered with black; and all the\r\nmost distinct races, when blue, are occasionally chequered in precisely the\r\nsame manner. Thus I have seen Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, Turbits,\r\nTumblers (Indian and English), Swallows, Bald-pates, and other toy-pigeons\r\nblue and chequered; and Mr. Esquilant has seen a chequered Runt. I bred\r\nfrom two pure blue Tumblers a chequered bird.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe facts hitherto given refer to the occasional appearance in pure races\r\nof blue birds with black wing-bars, and likewise of blue and chequered\r\nbirds; but it will now be seen that when two birds belonging to distinct\r\nraces are crossed, neither of which have, nor probably have had during many\r\ngenerations, a trace of blue in their plumage, or a trace of wing-bars and\r\nthe other characteristic marks, they very frequently produce mongrel\r\noffspring of a blue colour, sometimes chequered, with black wing-bars, &c.;\r\nor if not of a blue colour, yet with the several characteristic marks more\r\nor less plainly developed. I was led to investigate this subject from MM.\r\nBoitard and Corbié[341] having asserted that from crosses between certain\r\nbreeds it is rare to get anything but bisets or dovecot-pigeons, which, as\r\nwe know, are blue birds with the usual characteristic marks. We shall\r\nhereafter see that this subject possesses, independently of our present\r\nobject, considerable interest, so that I will give the results of my own\r\ntrials in full. I selected for experiment races which, when pure, very\r\nseldom produce birds of a blue colour, or have bars on their wings and\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nThe nun is white, with the head, tail, and primary wing-feathers black; it\r\nis a breed which was established as long ago {198} as the year 1600. I\r\ncrossed a male nun with a female red common tumbler, which latter variety\r\ngenerally breeds true. Thus neither parent had a trace of blue in the\r\nplumage, or of bars on the wing and tail. I should premise that common\r\ntumblers are rarely blue in England. From the above cross I reared several\r\nyoung: one was red over the whole back, but with the tail as blue as that\r\nof the rock-pigeon; the terminal bar, however, was absent, but the outer\r\nfeathers were edged with white: a second and third nearly resembled the\r\nfirst, but the tail in both presented a trace of the bar at the end: a\r\nfourth was brownish, and the wings showed a trace of the double bar: a\r\nfifth was pale blue over the whole breast, back, croup, and tail, but the\r\nneck and primary wing-feathers were reddish; the wings presented two\r\ndistinct bars of a red colour; the tail was not barred, but the outer\r\nfeathers were edged with white. I crossed this last curiously coloured bird\r\nwith a black mongrel of complicated descent, namely, from a black barb, a\r\nspot, and almond tumbler, so that the two young birds produced from this\r\ncross included the blood of five varieties, none of which had a trace of\r\nblue or of wing and tail bars: one of the two young birds was\r\nbrownish-black, with black wing-bars; the other was reddish-dun, with\r\nreddish wing-bars, paler than the rest of the body, with the croup pale\r\nblue, the tail bluish, with a trace of the terminal bar.\r\n\r\nMr. Eaton[342] matched two short-faced tumblers, namely, a splash cock and\r\nkite hen (neither of which are blue or barred), and from the first nest he\r\ngot a perfect blue bird, and from the second a silver or pale blue bird,\r\nboth of which, in accordance with all analogy, no doubt presented the usual\r\ncharacteristic marks.\r\n\r\nI crossed two male black barbs with two female red spots. These latter have\r\nthe whole body and wings white, with a spot on the forehead, the tail and\r\ntail-coverts red; the race existed at least as long ago as 1676, and now\r\nbreeds perfectly true, as was known to be the case in the year 1735.[343]\r\nBarbs are uniformly-coloured birds, with rarely even a trace of bars on the\r\nwing or tail; they are known to breed very true. The mongrels thus raised\r\nwere black or nearly black, or dark or pale brown, {199} sometimes slightly\r\npiebald with white: of these birds no less than six presented double\r\nwing-bars; in two the bars were conspicuous and quite black; in seven some\r\nwhite feathers appeared on the croup; and in two or three there was a trace\r\nof the terminal bar to the tail, but in none were the outer tail-feathers\r\nedged with white.\r\n\r\nI crossed black barbs (of two excellent strains) with purely-bred,\r\nsnow-white fantails. The mongrels were generally quite black, with a few of\r\nthe primary wing and tail-feathers white: others were dark reddish-brown,\r\nand others snow-white: none had a trace of wing-bars or of the white croup.\r\nI then paired together two of these mongrels, namely, a brown and black\r\nbird, and their offspring displayed wing-bars, faint, but of a darker brown\r\nthan the rest of body. In a second brood from the same parents a brown bird\r\nwas produced, with several white feathers confined to the croup.\r\n\r\nI crossed a male dun dragon belonging to a family which had been\r\ndun-coloured without wing-bars during several generations, with a uniform\r\nred barb (bred from two black barbs); and the offspring presented decided\r\nbut faint traces of wing-bars. I crossed a uniform red male runt with a\r\nwhite trumpeter; and the offspring had a slaty-blue tail, with a bar at the\r\nend, and with the outer feathers edged with white. I also crossed a female\r\nblack and white chequered trumpeter (of a different strain from the last)\r\nwith a male almond-tumbler, neither of which exhibited a trace of blue, or\r\nof the white croup, or of the bar at end of tail: nor is it probable that\r\nthe progenitors of these two birds had for many generations exhibited any\r\nof these characters, for I have never even heard of a blue trumpeter in\r\nthis country, and my almond-tumbler was purely bred; yet the tail of this\r\nmongrel was bluish, with a broad black bar at the end, and the croup was\r\nperfectly white. It may be observed in several of these cases, that the\r\ntail first shows a tendency to become by reversion blue; and this fact of\r\nthe persistency of colour in the tail and tail-coverts[344] will surprise\r\nno one who has attended to the crossing of pigeons.\r\n\r\n{200}\r\n\r\nThe last case which I will give is the most curious. I paired a mongrel\r\nfemale barb-fantail with a mongrel male barb-spot; neither of which\r\nmongrels had the least blue about them. Let it be remembered that blue\r\nbarbs are excessively rare; that spots, as has been already stated, were\r\nperfectly characterized in the year 1676, and breed perfectly true; this\r\nlikewise is the case with white fantails, so much so that I have never\r\nheard of white fantails throwing any other colour. Nevertheless the\r\noffspring from the above two mongrels was of exactly the same blue tint as\r\nthat of the wild rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands over the whole back\r\nand wings; the double black wing-bars were equally conspicuous; the tail\r\nwas exactly alike in all its characters, and the croup was pure white; the\r\nhead, however, was tinted with a shade of red, evidently derived from the\r\nspot, and was of a paler blue than in the rock-pigeon, as was the stomach.\r\nSo that two black barbs, a red spot, and a white fantail, as the four\r\npurely-bred grandparents, produced a bird of the same general blue colour,\r\ntogether with every characteristic mark, as in the wild _Columba livia_.\r\n\r\nWith respect to crossed breeds frequently producing blue birds chequered\r\nwith black, and resembling in all respects both the dovecot-pigeon and the\r\nchequered wild variety of the rock-pigeon, the statement before referred to\r\nby MM. Boitard and Corbié would almost suffice; but I will give three\r\ninstances of the appearance of such birds from crosses in which one alone\r\nof the parents or great-grandparents was blue, but not chequered. I crossed\r\na male blue turbit with a snow-white trumpeter, and the following year with\r\na dark, leaden-brown, short-faced tumbler; the offspring from the first\r\ncross were as perfectly chequered as any dovecot-pigeon; and from the\r\nsecond, so much so as to be nearly as black as the most darkly chequered\r\nrock-pigeon from Madeira. Another bird, whose great-grandparents were a\r\nwhite trumpeter, a white fantail, a white red-spot, a red runt, and a blue\r\npouter, was slaty-blue and chequered exactly like a dovecot-pigeon. I may\r\nhere {201} add a remark made to me by Mr. Wicking, who has had more\r\nexperience than any other person in England in breeding pigeons of various\r\ncolours: namely, that when a blue, or a blue and chequered bird, having\r\nblack wing-bars, once appears in any race and is allowed to breed, these\r\ncharacters are so strongly transmitted that it is extremely difficult to\r\neradicate them.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are we to conclude from this tendency in all the chief domestic\r\nraces, both when purely bred and more especially when intercrossed, to\r\nproduce offspring of a blue colour, with the same characteristic marks,\r\nvarying in the same manner, as in _Columba livia_? If we admit that these\r\nraces have all descended from _C. livia_, no breeder will doubt that the\r\noccasional appearance of blue birds thus characterised is accounted for on\r\nthe well-known principle of \"throwing back\" or reversion. Why crossing\r\nshould give so strong a tendency to reversion, we do not with certainty\r\nknow; but abundant evidence of this fact will be given in the following\r\nchapters. It is probable that I might have bred even for a century pure\r\nblack barbs, spots, nuns, white fantails, trumpeters, &c., without\r\nobtaining a single blue or barred bird; yet by crossing these breeds I\r\nreared in the first and second generation, during the course of only three\r\nor four years, a considerable number of young birds, more or less plainly\r\ncoloured blue, and with most of the characteristic marks. When black and\r\nwhite, or black and red birds, are crossed, it would appear that a slight\r\ntendency exists in both parents to produce blue offspring, and that this,\r\nwhen combined, overpowers the separate tendency in either parent to produce\r\nblack, or white, or red offspring.\r\n\r\nIf we reject the belief that all the races of the pigeon are the modified\r\ndescendants of _C. livia_, and suppose that they are descended from several\r\naboriginal stocks, then we must choose between the three following\r\nassumptions: firstly, that at least eight or nine species formerly existed\r\nwhich were aboriginally coloured in various ways, but have since varied in\r\nso exactly the same manner as to assume the colouring of _C. livia_; but\r\nthis assumption throws not the least light on the appearance of such\r\ncolours and marks when the races are crossed. Or secondly, we may assume\r\nthat the aboriginal species {202} were all coloured blue, and had the\r\nwing-bars and other characteristic marks of _C. livia_,--a supposition\r\nwhich is highly improbable, as besides this one species no existing member\r\nof the Columbidæ presents these combined characters; and it would not be\r\npossible to find any other instance of several species identical in\r\nplumage, yet as different in important points of structure as are pouters,\r\nfantails, carriers, tumblers, &c. Or lastly, we may assume that all the\r\nraces, whether descended from _C. livia_ or from several aboriginal\r\nspecies, although they have been bred with so much care and are so highly\r\nvalued by fanciers, have all been crossed within a dozen or score of\r\ngenerations with _C. livia_, and have thus acquired their tendency to\r\nproduce blue birds with the several characteristic marks. I have said that\r\nit must be assumed that each race has been crossed with _C. livia_ within a\r\ndozen, or, at the utmost, within a score of generations; for there is no\r\nreason to believe that crossed offspring ever revert to one of their\r\nancestors when removed by a greater number of generations. In a breed which\r\nhas been crossed only once, the tendency to reversion will naturally become\r\nless and less in the succeeding generations, as in each there will be less\r\nand less of the blood of the foreign breed; but when there has been no\r\ncross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both parents to\r\nrevert to some long-lost character, this tendency, for all that we can see\r\nto the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number\r\nof generations. These two distinct cases of reversion are often confounded\r\ntogether by those who have written on inheritance.\r\n\r\nConsidering, on the one hand, the improbability of the three assumptions\r\nwhich have just been discussed, and, on the other hand, how simply the\r\nfacts are explained on the principle of reversion, we may conclude that the\r\noccasional appearance in all the races, both when purely bred and more\r\nespecially when crossed, of blue birds, sometimes chequered, with double\r\nwing-bars, with white or blue croups, with a bar at the end of the tail,\r\nand with the outer tail-feathers edged with white, affords an argument of\r\nthe greatest weight in favour of the view that all are descended from\r\n_Columba livia_, including under this name the three or four wild varieties\r\nor sub-species before enumerated. {203}\r\n\r\nTo sum up the six foregoing arguments, which are opposed to the belief that\r\nthe chief domestic races are the descendants of at least eight or nine or\r\nperhaps a dozen species; for the crossing of any less number would not\r\nyield the characteristic differences between the several races. _Firstly_,\r\nthe improbability that so many species should still exist somewhere, but be\r\nunknown to ornithologists, or that they should have become within the\r\nhistorical period extinct, although man has had so little influence in\r\nexterminating the wild _C. livia_. _Secondly_, the improbability of man in\r\nformer times having thoroughly domesticated and rendered fertile under\r\nconfinement so many species. _Thirdly_, these supposed species having\r\nnowhere become feral. _Fourthly_, the extraordinary fact that man should,\r\nintentionally or by chance, have chosen for domestication several species,\r\nextremely abnormal in character; and furthermore, the points of structure\r\nwhich render these supposed species so abnormal being now highly variable.\r\n_Fifthly_, the fact of all the races, though differing in many important\r\npoints of structure, producing perfectly fertile mongrels; whilst all the\r\nhybrids which have been produced between even closely allied species in the\r\npigeon-family are sterile. _Sixthly_, the remarkable statements just given\r\non the tendency in all the races, both when purely bred and when crossed,\r\nto revert in numerous minute details of colouring to the character of the\r\nwild rock-pigeon, and to vary in a similar manner. To these arguments may\r\nbe added the extreme improbability that a number of species formerly\r\nexisted, which differed greatly from each other in some few points, but\r\nwhich resembled each other as closely as do the domestic races in other\r\npoints of structure, in voice, and in all their habits of life. When these\r\nseveral facts and arguments are fairly taken into consideration, it would\r\nrequire an overwhelming amount of evidence to make us admit that the chief\r\ndomestic races are descended from several aboriginal stocks; and of such\r\nevidence there is absolutely none.\r\n\r\nThe belief that the chief domestic races are descended from several wild\r\nstocks no doubt has arisen from the apparent improbability of such great\r\nmodifications of structure having been effected since man first\r\ndomesticated the rock-pigeon. Nor am I surprised at any degree of\r\nhesitation in admitting their common {204} origin: formerly, when I went\r\ninto my aviaries and watched such birds as pouters, carriers, barbs,\r\nfantails, and short-faced tumblers, &c., I could not persuade myself that\r\nthey had all descended from the same wild stock, and that man had\r\nconsequently in one sense created these remarkable modifications. Therefore\r\nI have argued the question of their origin at great, and, as some will\r\nthink, superfluous length.\r\n\r\nFinally, in favour of the belief that all the races are descended from a\r\nsingle stock, we have in _Columba livia_ a still existing and widely\r\ndistributed species, which can be and has been domesticated in various\r\ncountries. This species agrees in most points of structure and in all its\r\nhabits of life, as well as occasionally in every detail of plumage, with\r\nthe several domestic races. It breeds freely with them, and produces\r\nfertile offspring. It varies in a state of nature,[345] and still more so\r\nwhen semi-domesticated, as shown by comparing the Sierra Leone pigeons with\r\nthose of India, or with those which apparently have run wild in Madeira. It\r\nhas undergone a still greater amount of variation in the case of the\r\nnumerous toy-pigeons, which no one supposes to be descended from distinct\r\nspecies; yet some of these toy-pigeons have transmitted their character\r\ntruly for centuries. Why, then, should we hesitate to believe in that\r\ngreater amount of variation which is necessary for the production of the\r\neleven chief races? It should be borne in mind that in two of the most\r\nstrongly-marked races, namely, carriers and short-faced tumblers, the\r\nextreme forms can be connected with the parent-species by graduated\r\ndifferences not greater than those which may be observed between the\r\ndovecot-pigeons inhabiting different countries, or between the various\r\nkinds of toy-pigeons,--gradations which must certainly be attributed to\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nThat circumstances have been eminently favourable for the modification of\r\nthe pigeon through variation and selection will now be shown. The earliest\r\nrecord, as has been pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius, of pigeons in a\r\ndomesticated condition, occurs in the fifth Egyptian dynasty, about {205}\r\n3000 B.C.;[346] but Mr. Birch, of the British Museum, informs me that the\r\npigeon appears in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. Domestic pigeons\r\nare mentioned in Genesis, Leviticus, and Isaiah.[347] In the time of the\r\nRomans, as we hear from Pliny,[348] immense prices were given for pigeons;\r\n\"nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree\r\nand race.\" In India, about the year 1600, pigeons were much valued by Akber\r\nKhan: 20,000 birds were carried about with the court, and the merchants\r\nbrought valuable collections. \"The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some\r\nvery rare breeds. His Majesty,\" says the courtly historian, \"by crossing\r\nthe breeds, which method was never practised before, has improved them\r\nastonishingly.\"[349] Akber Khan possessed seventeen distinct kinds, eight\r\nof which were valuable for beauty alone. At about this same period of 1600\r\nthe Dutch, according to Aldrovandi, were as eager about pigeons as the\r\nRomans had formerly been. The breeds which were kept during the fifteenth\r\ncentury in Europe and in India apparently differed from each other.\r\nTavernier, in his Travels in 1677, speaks, as does Chardin in 1735, of the\r\nvast number of pigeon-houses in Persia; and the former remarks that, as\r\nChristians were not permitted to keep pigeons, some of the vulgar actually\r\nturned Mahometans for this sole purpose. The Emperor of Morocco had his\r\nfavourite keeper of pigeons, as is mentioned in Moore's treatise, published\r\n1737. In England, from the time of Willughby in 1678 to the present day, as\r\nwell as in Germany and in France, numerous treatises have been published on\r\nthe pigeon. In India, about a hundred years ago, a Persian treatise was\r\nwritten; and the writer thought it no light affair, for he begins with a\r\nsolemn invocation, \"in the name of God, the gracious and merciful.\" Many\r\nlarge towns, in Europe and the United States, now have their societies of\r\ndevoted pigeon-fanciers: at present there are three such societies in\r\nLondon. In India, as I hear from {206} Mr. Blyth, the inhabitants of Delhi\r\nand of some other great cities are eager fanciers. Mr. Layard informs me\r\nthat most of the known breeds are kept in Ceylon. In China, according to\r\nMr. Swinhoe of Amoy, and Dr. Lockhart of Shangai, carriers, fantails,\r\ntumblers, and other varieties are reared with care, especially by the\r\nbonzes or priests. The Chinese fasten a kind of whistle to the\r\ntail-feathers of their pigeons, and as the flock wheels through the air\r\nthey produce a sweet sound. In Egypt the late Abbas Pacha was a great\r\nfancier of fantails. Many pigeons are kept at Cairo and Constantinople, and\r\nthese have lately been imported by native merchants, as I hear from Sir W.\r\nElliot, into Southern India, and sold at high prices.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements show in how many countries, and during how long a\r\nperiod, many men have been passionately devoted to the breeding of pigeons.\r\nHear how an enthusiastic fancier at the present day writes: \"If it were\r\npossible for noblemen and gentlemen to know the amazing amount of solace\r\nand pleasure derived from Almond Tumblers, when they begin to understand\r\ntheir properties, I should think that scarce any nobleman or gentleman\r\nwould be without their aviaries of Almond Tumblers.\"[350] The pleasure thus\r\ntaken is of paramount importance, as it leads amateurs carefully to note\r\nand preserve each slight deviation of structure which strikes their fancy.\r\nPigeons are often closely confined during their whole lives; they do not\r\npartake of their naturally varied diet; they have often been transported\r\nfrom one climate to another; and all these changes in their conditions of\r\nlife would be likely to cause variability. Pigeons have been domesticated\r\nfor nearly 5000 years, and have been kept in many places, so that the\r\nnumbers reared under domestication must have been enormous; and this is\r\nanother circumstance of high importance, for it obviously favours the\r\nchance of rare modifications of structure occasionally appearing. Slight\r\nvariations of all kinds would almost certainly be observed, and, if valued,\r\nwould, owing to the following circumstances, be preserved and propagated\r\nwith unusual facility. Pigeons, differently from any other domesticated\r\nanimal, can easily be mated for life, and, though kept with other pigeons,\r\nthey rarely prove unfaithful to each other. Even when the {207} male does\r\nbreak his marriage-vow, he does not permanently desert his mate. I have\r\nbred in the same aviaries many pigeons of different kinds, and never reared\r\na single bird of an impure strain. Hence a fancier can with the greatest\r\nease select and match his birds. He will also soon see the good results of\r\nhis care; for pigeons breed with extraordinary rapidity. He may freely\r\nreject inferior birds, as they serve at an early age as excellent food. To\r\nsum up, pigeons are easily kept, paired, and selected; vast numbers have\r\nbeen reared; great zeal in breeding them has been shown by many men in\r\nvarious countries; and this would lead to their close discrimination, and\r\nto a strong desire to exhibit some novelty, or to surpass other fanciers in\r\nthe excellence of already established breeds.\r\n\r\n_History of the principal Races of the Pigeon_.[351]\r\n\r\n    Before discussing the means and steps by which the chief races have\r\n    been formed, it will be advisable to give some historical details, for\r\n    more is known of the history of the pigeon, little though this be, than\r\n    of any other domesticated animal. Some of the cases are interesting as\r\n    proving how long domestic varieties may be propagated with exactly the\r\n    same or nearly the same characters; and other cases are still more\r\n    interesting as showing how slowly but steadily races have been greatly\r\n    modified during successive generations. In the last chapter I stated\r\n    that Trumpeters and Laughers, both so remarkable for their voices, seem\r\n    to have been perfectly characterized in 1735; and Laughers were\r\n    apparently known in India before the year 1600. Spots in 1676, and Nuns\r\n    in the time of Aldrovandi, before 1600, were coloured exactly as they\r\n    now are. Common Tumblers and Ground Tumblers exhibited in India, before\r\n    the year 1600, the same extraordinary peculiarities of flight as at the\r\n    present day, for they are well described in the 'Ayeen Akbery.' These\r\n    breeds may all have existed for a much longer period; we know only that\r\n    they were perfectly characterized at the dates above given. The\r\n    _average_ length of life of the domestic pigeon is probably about five\r\n    or six years; if so, some of these races have retained their character\r\n    perfectly for at least forty or fifty generations.\r\n\r\n    _Pouters._--These birds, as far as a very short description serves for\r\n    comparison, appear to have been well characterized in Aldrovandi's\r\n    time,[352] before the year 1600. Length of body and length of leg are\r\n    at the present time the two chief points of excellence. In 1735 Moore\r\n    said (see Mr. J. M. Eaton's edition)--and Moore was a first-rate\r\n    fancier--that he once saw a bird with {208} a body 20 inches in length,\r\n    \"though 17 or 18 inches is reckoned a very good length;\" and he has\r\n    seen the legs very nearly 7 inches in length, yet a leg 6½ or 6¾ long\r\n    \"must be allowed to be a very good one.\" Mr. Bult, the most successful\r\n    breeder of Pouters in the world, informs me that at present (1858) the\r\n    standard length of the body is not less than 18 inches; but he has\r\n    measured one bird 19 inches in length, and has heard of 20 and 22\r\n    inches, but doubts the truth of these latter statements. The standard\r\n    length of the leg is now 7 inches, but Mr. Bult has recently measured\r\n    two of his own birds with legs 7½ long. So that in the 123 years which\r\n    have elapsed since 1735 there has been hardly any increase in the\r\n    standard length of the body; 17 or 18 inches was formerly reckoned a\r\n    very good length, and now 18 inches is the minimum standard; but the\r\n    length of leg seems to have increased, as Moore never saw one quite 7\r\n    inches long; now the standard is 7, and two of Mr. Bult's birds\r\n    measured 7½ inches in length. The extremely slight improvement in\r\n    Pouters, except in the length of the leg, during the last 123 years,\r\n    may be partly accounted for by the neglect which they suffered, as I am\r\n    informed by Mr. Bult, until within the last 20 or 30 years. About\r\n    1765[353] there was a change of fashion, stouter and more feathered\r\n    legs being preferred to thin and nearly naked legs.\r\n\r\n    _Fantails._--The first notice of the existence of this breed is in\r\n    India, before the year 1600, as given in the 'Ayeen Akbery;'[354] at\r\n    this date, judging from Aldrovandi, the breed was unknown in Europe. In\r\n    1677 Willughby speaks of a Fantail with 26 tail-feathers; in 1735 Moore\r\n    saw one with 36 feathers; and in 1824 MM. Boitard and Corbié assert\r\n    that in France birds can easily be found with 42 tail-feathers. In\r\n    England, the number of the tail-feathers is not at present so much\r\n    regarded as their upward direction and expansion. The general carriage\r\n    of the bird is likewise now much regarded. The old descriptions do not\r\n    suffice to show whether in these latter respects there has been much\r\n    improvement; but if fantails had formerly existed with their heads and\r\n    tails touching each other, as at the present time, the fact would\r\n    almost certainly have been noticed. The Fantails which are now found in\r\n    India probably show the state of the race, as far as carriage is\r\n    concerned, at the date of their introduction into Europe; and some,\r\n    said to have been brought from Calcutta, which I kept alive, were in a\r\n    marked manner inferior to our exhibition birds. The Java Fantail shows\r\n    the same difference in carriage; and although Mr. Swinhoe has counted\r\n    18 and 24 tail-feathers in his birds, a first-rate specimen sent to me\r\n    had only 14 tail-feathers.\r\n\r\n    _Jacobins._--This breed existed before 1600, but the hood, judging from\r\n    the figure given by Aldrovandi, did not enclose the head nearly so\r\n    perfectly as at present: nor was the head then white; nor were the\r\n    wings and tail so long, but this last character might have been\r\n    overlooked by the rude artist. In Moore's time, in 1735, the Jacobin\r\n    was considered the {209} smallest kind of pigeon, and the bill is said\r\n    to be very short. Hence either the Jacobin, or the other kinds with\r\n    which it was then compared, must have been since considerably modified;\r\n    for Moore's description (and it must be remembered that he was a\r\n    first-rate judge) is clearly not applicable, as far as size of body and\r\n    length of beak are concerned, to our present Jacobins. In 1795, judging\r\n    from Bechstein, the breed had assumed its present character.\r\n\r\n    _Turbits._--It has generally been supposed by the older writers on\r\n    pigeons, that the Turbit is the Cortbeck of Aldrovandi; but if this be\r\n    the case, it is an extraordinary fact that the characteristic frill\r\n    should not have been noticed. The beak, moreover, of the Cortbeck is\r\n    described as closely resembling that of the Jacobin, which shows a\r\n    change in the one or the other race. The Turbit, with its\r\n    characteristic frill and bearing its present name, is described by\r\n    Willughby in 1677; and the bill is said to be like that of the\r\n    bullfinch,--a good comparison, but now more strictly applicable to the\r\n    beak of the Barb. The sub-breed called the Owl was well known in\r\n    Moore's time, in 1735.\r\n\r\n    _Tumblers._--Common Tumblers, as well as Ground Tumblers, perfect as\r\n    far as tumbling is concerned, existed in India before the year 1600;\r\n    and at this period diversified modes of flight, such as flying at\r\n    night, the ascent to a great height, and manner of descent, seem to\r\n    have been much attended to, as at the present time, in India.\r\n    Belon[355] in 1555 saw in Paphlagonia what he describes as \"a very new\r\n    thing, viz. pigeons which flew so high in the air that they were lost\r\n    to view, but returned to their pigeon-house without separating.\" This\r\n    manner of flight is characteristic of our present Tumblers, but it is\r\n    clear that Belon would have mentioned the act of tumbling if the\r\n    pigeons described by him had tumbled. Tumblers were not known in Europe\r\n    in 1600, as they are not mentioned by Aldrovandi, who discusses the\r\n    flight of pigeons. They are briefly alluded to by Willughby, in 1687,\r\n    as small pigeons \"which show like footballs in the air.\" The\r\n    short-faced race did not exist at this period, as Willughby could not\r\n    have overlooked birds so remarkable for their small size and short\r\n    beaks. We can even trace some of the steps by which this race has been\r\n    produced. Moore in 1735 enumerates correctly the chief points of\r\n    excellence, but does not give any description of the several\r\n    sub-breeds; and from this fact Mr. Eaton infers[356] that the\r\n    short-faced Tumbler had not then come to full perfection. Moore even\r\n    speaks of the Jacobin as being the smallest pigeon. Thirty years\r\n    afterwards, in 1765, in the Treatise dedicated to Mayor, short-faced\r\n    Almond Tumblers are fully described, but the author, an excellent\r\n    fancier, expressly states in his Preface (p. xiv.) that, \"from great\r\n    care and expense in breeding them, they have arrived to so great\r\n    perfection and are so different from what they were 20 or 30 years\r\n    past, that an old fancier would have condemned them for no other reason\r\n    than because they are not like what used to be thought good when he was\r\n    in the fancy before.\" {210} Hence it would appear that there was a\r\n    rather sudden change in the character of the short-faced Tumbler at\r\n    about this period; and there is reason to suspect that a dwarfed and\r\n    half-monstrous bird, the parent-form of the several short-faced\r\n    sub-breeds, then appeared. I suspect this because short-faced Tumblers\r\n    are born with their beaks (ascertained by careful measurement) as\r\n    short, proportionally with the size of their bodies, as in the adult\r\n    bird; and in this respect they differ greatly from all other breeds,\r\n    which slowly acquire during growth their various characteristic\r\n    qualities.\r\n\r\n    Since the year 1765 there has been some change in one of the chief\r\n    characters of the short-faced Tumbler, namely, in the length of the\r\n    beak. Fanciers measure the \"head and beak\" from the tip of the beak to\r\n    the front corner of the eyeball. About the year 1765 a \"head and beak\"\r\n    was considered good,[357] which, measured in the usual manner, was 7/8\r\n    of an inch in length; now it ought not to exceed 5/8 of an inch; \"it is\r\n    however possible,\" as Mr. Eaton candidly confesses, \"for a bird to be\r\n    considered as pleasant or neat even at 6/8 of an inch, but exceeding\r\n    that length it must be looked upon as unworthy of attention.\" Mr. Eaton\r\n    states that he has never seen in the course of his life more than two\r\n    or three birds with the \"head and beak\" not exceeding half an inch in\r\n    length; \"still I believe in the course of a few years that the head and\r\n    beak will be shortened, and that half-inch birds will not be considered\r\n    so great a curiosity as at the present time.\" That Mr. Eaton's opinion\r\n    deserves attention cannot be doubted, considering his success in\r\n    winning prizes at our exhibitions. Finally in regard to the Tumbler it\r\n    may be concluded from the facts above given that it was originally\r\n    introduced into Europe, probably first into England, from the East; and\r\n    that it then resembled our common English Tumbler, or more probably the\r\n    Persian or Indian Tumbler, with a beak only just perceptibly shorter\r\n    than that of the common dovecot-pigeon. With respect to the short-faced\r\n    Tumbler, which is not known to exist in the East, there can hardly be a\r\n    doubt that the whole wonderful change in the size of the head, beak,\r\n    body, and feet, and in general carriage, has been produced during the\r\n    last two centuries by continued selection, aided probably by the birth\r\n    of a semi-monstrous bird somewhere about the year 1750.\r\n\r\n    _Runts._--Of their history little can be said. In the time of Pliny the\r\n    pigeons of Campania were the largest known; and from this fact alone\r\n    some authors assert that they were Runts. In Aldrovandi's time, in\r\n    1600, two sub-breeds existed; but one of them, the short-beaked, is now\r\n    extinct in Europe.\r\n\r\n    _Barbs._--Notwithstanding statements to the contrary, it seems to me\r\n    impossible to recognise the barb in Aldrovandi's descriptions and\r\n    figures; four breeds, however, existed in the year 1600 which were\r\n    evidently allied both to Barbs and Carriers. To show how difficult it\r\n    is to recognise some of the breeds described by Aldrovandi, I will give\r\n    the different opinions in regard to the above four kinds, named by him\r\n    _C. Indica_, _Cretensis_, _Gutturosa_, and _Persica_. Willughby thought\r\n    that the _Columba Indica_ was a {211} Turbit, but the eminent fancier\r\n    Mr. Brent believes that it was an inferior Barb: _C. Cretensis_, with a\r\n    short beak and a swelling on the upper mandible, cannot be recognised:\r\n    _C._ (falsely called) _gutturosa_, which from its _rostrum_, _breve_,\r\n    _crassum_, et _tuberosum_ seems to me to come nearest to the Barb, Mr.\r\n    Brent believes to be a Carrier; and lastly, the _C. Persica et\r\n    Turcica,_ Mr. Brent thinks, and I quite concur with him, was a\r\n    short-beaked Carrier with very little wattle. In 1687 the Barb was\r\n    known in England, and Willughby describes the beak as like that of the\r\n    Turbit; but it is not credible that his Barb should have had a beak\r\n    like that of our present birds, for so accurate an observer could not\r\n    have overlooked its great breadth.\r\n\r\n    _English Carrier._--We may look in vain in Aldrovandi's work for any\r\n    bird resembling our prize Carriers; the _C. Persica et Turcica_ of this\r\n    author comes the nearest, but is said to have had a short thick beak;\r\n    therefore it must have approached in character a Barb, and have\r\n    differed greatly from our Carriers. In Willughby's time, in 1677, we\r\n    can clearly recognise the Carrier, but he adds, \"the bill is not short,\r\n    but of a moderate length,\" a description which no one would apply to\r\n    our present Carriers, so conspicuous for the extraordinary length of\r\n    their beaks. The old names given in Europe to the Carrier, and the\r\n    several names now in use in India, indicate that Carriers originally\r\n    came from Persia; and Willughby's description would perfectly apply to\r\n    the Bussorah Carrier as it now exists in Madras. In later times we can\r\n    partially trace the progress of change in our English Carriers: Moore\r\n    in 1735 says \"an inch and a half is reckoned a long beak, though there\r\n    are very good Carriers that are found not to exceed an inch and a\r\n    quarter.\" These birds must have resembled, or perhaps been a little\r\n    superior to, the Carriers, previously described, which are now found in\r\n    Persia. In England at the present day \"there are,\" as Mr. Eaton[358]\r\n    states, \"beaks that would measure (from edge of eye to tip of beak) one\r\n    inch and three-quarters, and some few even two inches in length.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these historical details we see that nearly all the chief domestic\r\nraces existed before the year 1600. Some remarkable only for colour appear\r\nto have been identical with our present breeds, some were nearly the same,\r\nsome considerably different, and some have since become extinct. Several\r\nbreeds, such as Finnikins and Turners, the swallow-tailed pigeon of\r\nBechstein and the Carmelite, seem both to have originated and to have\r\ndisappeared within this same period. Any one now visiting a well-stocked\r\nEnglish aviary would certainly pick out as the most distinct kinds, the\r\nmassive Runt, the Carrier with its wonderfully elongated beak and great\r\nwattles, the Barb with its short broad beak and eye-wattles, the\r\nshort-faced Tumbler {212} with its small conical beak, the Pouter with its\r\ngreat crop, long legs and body, the Fantail with its upraised,\r\nwidely-expanded, well-feathered tail, the Turbit with its frill and short\r\nblunt beak, and the Jacobin with its hood. Now, if this same person could\r\nhave viewed the pigeons kept before 1600 by Akber Khan in India and by\r\nAldrovandi in Europe, he would have seen the Jacobin with a less perfect\r\nhood; the Turbit apparently without its frill; the Pouter with shorter\r\nlegs, and in every way less remarkable--that is, if Aldrovandi's Pouter\r\nresembled the old German kind; the Fantail would have been far less\r\nsingular in appearance, and would have had much fewer feathers in its tail;\r\nhe would have seen excellent flying Tumblers, but he would in vain have\r\nlooked for the marvellous short-faced breeds; he would have seen birds\r\nallied to barbs, but it is extremely doubtful whether he would have met\r\nwith our actual Barbs; and lastly, he would have found Carriers with beaks\r\nand wattle incomparably less developed than in our English Carriers. He\r\nmight have classed most of the breeds in the same groups as at present; but\r\nthe differences between the groups were then far less strongly pronounced\r\nthan at present. In short, the several breeds had at this early period not\r\ndiverged in so great a degree from their aboriginal common parent, the wild\r\nrock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n_Manner of Formation of the chief Races._\r\n\r\nWe will now consider more closely the probable steps by which the chief\r\nraces have been formed. As long as pigeons are kept semi-domesticated in\r\ndovecots in their native country, without any care in selecting and\r\nmatching them, they are liable to little more variation than the wild _C.\r\nlivia_, namely, in the wings becoming chequered with black, in the croup\r\nbeing blue or white, and in the size of the body. When, however,\r\ndovecot-pigeons are transported into diversified countries, such as Sierra\r\nLeone, the Malay archipelago, and Madeira (where the wild _C. livia_ is not\r\nknown to exist), they are exposed to new conditions of life; and apparently\r\nin consequence they vary in a somewhat greater degree. When closely\r\nconfined, either for the pleasure of watching them, or to prevent their\r\nstraying, they must be exposed, even under their native climate, to {213}\r\nconsiderably different conditions; for they cannot obtain their natural\r\ndiversity of food; and, what is probably more important, they are\r\nabundantly fed, whilst debarred from taking much exercise. Under these\r\ncircumstances we might expect to find, from the analogy of all other\r\ndomesticated animals, a greater amount of individual variability than with\r\nthe wild pigeon; and this is the case. The want of exercise apparently\r\ntends to reduce the size of the feet and organs of flight; and then, from\r\nthe law of correlation of growth, the beak apparently becomes affected.\r\nFrom what we now see occasionally taking place in our aviaries, we may\r\nconclude that sudden variations or sports, such as the appearance of a\r\ncrest of feathers on the head, of feathered feet, of a new shade of colour,\r\nof an additional feather in the tail or wing, would occur at rare intervals\r\nduring the many centuries which have elapsed since the pigeon was first\r\ndomesticated. At the present day such \"sports\" are generally rejected as\r\nblemishes; and there is so much mystery in the breeding of pigeons that, if\r\na valuable sport did occur, its history would often be concealed. Before\r\nthe last hundred and fifty years, there is hardly a chance of the history\r\nof any such sport having been recorded. But it by no means follows from\r\nthis that such sports in former times, when the pigeon had undergone much\r\nless variation, would have been rejected. We are profoundly ignorant of the\r\ncause of each sudden and apparently spontaneous variation, as well as of\r\nthe infinitely numerous shades of difference between the birds of the same\r\nfamily. But in a future chapter we shall see that all such variations\r\nappear to be the indirect result of changes of some kind in the conditions\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nHence, after a long course of domestication, we might expect to see in the\r\npigeon much individual variability, and occasional sudden variations, as\r\nwell as slight modifications from the lessened use of certain parts,\r\ntogether with the effects of correlation of growth. But without selection\r\nall this would produce only a trifling or no result; for without such aid\r\ndifferences of all kinds would, from the two following causes, soon\r\ndisappear. In a healthy and vigorous lot of pigeons many more young birds\r\nare killed for food or die than are reared to maturity; so that an\r\nindividual having any peculiar character, if not selected, would run a good\r\nchance of being destroyed; and if not destroyed, the {214} peculiarity in\r\nquestion would almost certainly be obliterated by free intercrossing. It\r\nmight, however, occasionally happen that the same variation repeatedly\r\noccurred, owing to the action of peculiar and uniform conditions of life,\r\nand in this case it would prevail independently of selection. But when\r\nselection is brought into play all is changed; for this is the\r\nfoundation-stone in the formation of new races; and with the pigeon,\r\ncircumstances, as we have already seen, are eminently favourable for\r\nselection. When a bird presenting some conspicuous variation has been\r\npreserved, and its offspring have been selected, carefully matched, and\r\nagain propagated, and so onwards during successive generations, the\r\nprinciple is so obvious that nothing more need be said about it. This may\r\nbe called _methodical selection_, for the breeder has a distinct object in\r\nview, namely, to preserve some character which has actually appeared; or to\r\ncreate some improvement already pictured in his mind.\r\n\r\nAnother form of selection has hardly been noticed by those authors who have\r\ndiscussed this subject, but is even more important. This form may be called\r\n_unconscious selection_, for the breeder selects his birds unconsciously,\r\nunintentionally, and without method, yet he surely though slowly produces a\r\ngreat result. I refer to the effects which follow from each fancier at\r\nfirst procuring and afterwards rearing as good birds as he can, according\r\nto his skill, and according to the standard of excellence at each\r\nsuccessive period. He does not wish permanently to modify the breed; he\r\ndoes not look to the distant future, or speculate on the final result of\r\nthe slow accumulation during many generations of successive slight changes:\r\nhe is content if he possesses a good stock, and more than content if he can\r\nbeat his rivals. The fancier in the time of Aldrovandi, when in the year\r\n1600 he admired his own jacobins, pouters, or carriers, never reflected\r\nwhat their descendants in the year 1860 would become; he would have been\r\nastonished could he have seen our jacobins, our improved English carriers,\r\nand our pouters; he would probably have denied that they were the\r\ndescendants of his own once admired stock, and he would perhaps not have\r\nvalued them, for no other reason, as was written in 1765, \"than because\r\nthey were not like what used to be thought good when he was in the fancy.\"\r\nNo one will attribute the lengthened beak of the {215} carrier, the\r\nshortened beak of the short-faced tumbler, the lengthened leg of the\r\npouter, the more perfectly-enclosed hood of the jacobin, &c.,--changes\r\neffected since the time of Aldrovandi, or even since a much later\r\nperiod,--to the direct and immediate action of the conditions of life. For\r\nthese several races have been modified in various and even in directly\r\nopposite ways, though kept under the same climate and treated in all\r\nrespects in as nearly uniform a manner as possible. Each slight change in\r\nthe length or shortness of the beak, in the length of leg, &c., has no\r\ndoubt been indirectly and remotely caused by some change in the conditions\r\nto which the bird has been subjected, but we must attribute the final\r\nresult, as is manifest in those cases of which we have any historical\r\nrecord, to the continued selection and accumulation of many slight\r\nsuccessive variations.\r\n\r\nThe action of unconscious selection, as far as pigeons are concerned,\r\ndepends on a universal principle in human nature, namely, on our rivalry,\r\nand desire to outdo our neighbours. We see this in every fleeting fashion,\r\neven in our dress, and it leads the fancier to endeavour to exaggerate\r\nevery peculiarity in his breeds. A great authority on pigeons[359] says,\r\n\"Fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard, that is, half and\r\nhalf, which is neither here nor there, but admire extremes.\" After\r\nremarking that the fancier of short-faced beard tumblers wishes for a very\r\nshort beak, and that the fancier of long-faced beard tumblers wishes for a\r\nvery long beak, he says, with respect to one of intermediate length, \"Don't\r\ndeceive yourself. Do you suppose for a moment the short or the long-faced\r\nfancier would accept such a bird as a gift? Certainly not; the short-faced\r\nfancier could see no beauty in it; the long-faced fancier would swear there\r\nwas no use in it, &c.\" In these comical passages, written seriously, we see\r\nthe principle which has ever guided fanciers, and has led to such great\r\nmodifications in all the domestic races which are valued solely for their\r\nbeauty or curiosity.\r\n\r\nFashions in pigeon-breeding endure for long periods; we cannot change the\r\nstructure of a bird as quickly as we can the fashion of our dress. In the\r\ntime of Aldrovandi, no doubt the more the pouter inflated his crop, the\r\nmore he was valued. Nevertheless, fashions do to a certain extent change;\r\nfirst one {216} point of structure and then another is attended to; or\r\ndifferent breeds are admired at different times and in different countries.\r\nAs the author just quoted remarks, \"the fancy ebbs and flows; a thorough\r\nfancier now-a-days never stoops to breed toy-birds;\" yet these very \"toys\"\r\nare now most carefully bred in Germany. Breeds which at the present time\r\nare highly valued in India are considered worthless in England. No doubt,\r\nwhen breeds are neglected, they degenerate; still we may believe that, as\r\nlong as they are kept under the same conditions of life, characters once\r\ngained will be partially retained for a long time, and may form, the\r\nstarting-point for a future course of selection.\r\n\r\nLet it not be objected to this view of the action of unconscious selection\r\nthat fanciers would not observe or care for extremely slight differences.\r\nThose alone who have associated with fanciers can be thoroughly aware of\r\ntheir accurate powers of discrimination acquired by long practice, and of\r\nthe care and labour which they bestow on their birds. I have known a\r\nfancier deliberately study his birds day after day to settle which to match\r\ntogether and which to reject. Observe how difficult the subject appears to\r\none of the most eminent and experienced fanciers. Mr. Eaton, the winner of\r\nmany prizes, says, \"I would here particularly guard you against keeping too\r\ngreat a variety of pigeons, otherwise you will know a little about all the\r\nkinds, but nothing about one as it ought to be known.\" \"It is possible\r\nthere may be a few fanciers that have a good general knowledge of the\r\nseveral fancy pigeons, but there are many who labour under the delusion of\r\nsupposing they know what they do not.\" Speaking exclusively of one\r\nsub-variety of one race, namely, the short-faced almond tumbler, and after\r\nsaying that some fanciers sacrifice every property to obtain a good head\r\nand beak, and that other fanciers sacrifice everything for plumage, he\r\nremarks: \"Some young fanciers who are over covetous go in for all the five\r\nproperties at once, and they have their reward by getting nothing.\" In\r\nIndia, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, pigeons are likewise selected and matched\r\nwith the greatest care. But we must not judge of the slight differences\r\nwhich would have been valued in ancient days, by those which are now valued\r\nafter the formation of many races, each with its own standard of\r\nperfection, kept uniform by our numerous {217} Exhibitions. The ambition of\r\nthe most energetic fancier may be fully satisfied by the difficulty of\r\nexcelling other fanciers in the breeds already established, without trying\r\nto form a new one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA difficulty with respect to the power of selection will perhaps already\r\nhave occurred to the reader, namely, what could have led fanciers first to\r\nattempt to make such singular breeds as pouters, fantails, carriers, &c.?\r\nBut it is this very difficulty which the principle of unconscious selection\r\nremoves. Undoubtedly no fancier ever did intentionally make such an\r\nattempt. All that we need suppose is that a variation occurred sufficiently\r\nmarked to catch the discriminating eye of some ancient fancier, and then\r\nunconscious selection carried on for many generations, that is, the wish of\r\nsucceeding fanciers to excel their rivals, would do the rest. In the case\r\nof the fantail we may suppose that the first progenitor of the breed had a\r\ntail only slightly erected, as may now be seen in certain runts,[360] with\r\nsome increase in the number of the tail-feathers, as now occasionally\r\noccurs with nuns. In the case of the pouter we may suppose that some bird\r\ninflated its crop a little more than other pigeons, as is now the case in a\r\nslight degree with the oesophagus of the turbit. We do not in the least\r\nknow the origin of the common tumbler, but we may suppose that a bird was\r\nborn with some affection of the brain, leading it to make somersaults in\r\nthe air; and the difficulty in this case is lessened, as we know that,\r\nbefore the year 1600, in India, pigeons remarkable for their diversified\r\nmanner of flight were much valued, and by the order of the Emperor Akber\r\nKhan were sedulously trained and carefully matched.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases we have supposed that a sudden variation,\r\nconspicuous enough to catch a fancier's eye, first appeared; but even this\r\ndegree of abruptness in the process of variation is not necessary for the\r\nformation of a new breed. When the same kind of pigeon has been kept pure,\r\nand has been bred during a long period by two or more fanciers, slight\r\ndifferences in the strain can often be recognised. Thus I have seen\r\nfirst-rate jacobins in one man's possession which certainly {218} differed\r\nslightly in several characters from those kept by another. I possessed some\r\nexcellent barbs descended from a pair which had won a prize, and another\r\nlot descended from a stock formerly kept by that famous fancier Sir John\r\nSebright, and these plainly differed in the form of the beak; but the\r\ndifferences were so slight, that they could hardly be described by words.\r\nAgain, the common English and Dutch tumbler differ in a somewhat greater\r\ndegree, both in length of beak and shape of head. What first caused these\r\nslight differences cannot be explained any more than why one man has a long\r\nnose and another a short one. In the strains long kept distinct by\r\ndifferent fanciers, such differences are so common that they cannot be\r\naccounted for by the accident of the birds first chosen for breeding having\r\nbeen originally as different as they now are. The explanation no doubt lies\r\nin selection of a slightly different nature having been applied in each\r\ncase; for no two fanciers have exactly the same taste, and consequently no\r\ntwo, in choosing and carefully matching their birds, prefer or select\r\nexactly the same. As each man naturally admires his own birds, he goes on\r\ncontinually exaggerating by selection whatever slight peculiarities they\r\nmay possess. This will more especially happen with fanciers living in\r\ndifferent countries, who do not compare their stocks and aim at a common\r\nstandard of perfection. Thus, when a mere strain has once been formed,\r\nunconscious selection steadily tends to augment the amount of difference,\r\nand thus converts the strain into a sub-breed, and this ultimately into a\r\nwell-marked breed or race.\r\n\r\nThe principle of correlation of growth should never be lost sight of. Most\r\npigeons have small feet, apparently caused by their lessened use, and from\r\ncorrelation, as it would appear, their beaks have likewise become reduced\r\nin length. The beak is a conspicuous organ, and, as soon as it had thus\r\nbecome perceptibly shortened, fanciers would almost certainly strive to\r\nreduce it still more by the continued selection of birds with the shortest\r\nbeaks; whilst at the same time other fanciers, as we know has actually been\r\nthe case, would, in other sub-breeds, strive to increase its length. With\r\nthe increased length of the beak, the tongue would become greatly\r\nlengthened, as would the eyelids with the increased development {219} of\r\nthe eye-wattles; with the reduced or increased size of the feet the number\r\nof the scutellæ would vary; with the length of the wing the number of the\r\nprimary wing-feathers would differ; and with the increased length of the\r\nbody in the pouter the number of the sacral vertebræ would be augmented.\r\nThese important and correlated differences of structure do not invariably\r\ncharacterise any breed; but if they had been attended to and selected with\r\nas much care as the more conspicuous external differences, there can hardly\r\nbe a doubt that they would have been rendered constant. Fanciers could\r\nassuredly have made a race of tumblers with nine instead of ten primary\r\nwing-feathers, seeing how often the number nine appears without any wish on\r\ntheir part, and indeed in the case of the white-winged varieties in\r\nopposition to their wish. In a similar manner, if the vertebræ had been\r\nvisible and had been attended to by fanciers, assuredly an additional\r\nnumber might easily have been fixed in the pouter. If these latter\r\ncharacters had once been rendered constant we should never have suspected\r\nthat they had at first been highly variable, or that they had arisen from\r\ncorrelation, in the one case with the shortness of the wings, and in the\r\nother case with the length of the body.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how the chief domestic races have become distinctly\r\nseparated from each other, it is important to bear in mind, that fanciers\r\nconstantly try to breed from the best birds, and consequently that those\r\nwhich are inferior in the requisite qualities are in each generation\r\nneglected; so that after a time the less improved parent-stocks and many\r\nsubsequently formed intermediate grades become extinct. This has occurred\r\nin the case of the pouter, turbit, and trumpeter, for these highly improved\r\nbreeds are now left without any links closely connecting them either with\r\neach other or with the aboriginal rock-pigeon. In other countries, indeed,\r\nwhere the same care has not been applied, or where the same fashion has not\r\nprevailed, the earlier forms may long remain unaltered or altered only in a\r\nslight degree, and we are thus sometimes enabled to recover the connecting\r\nlinks. This is the case in Persia and India with the tumbler and carrier,\r\nwhich there differ but slightly from the rock-pigeon in the {220}\r\nproportions of their beaks. So again in Java, the fantail sometimes has\r\nonly fourteen caudal feathers, and the tail is much less elevated and\r\nexpanded than in our improved birds; so that the Java bird forms a link\r\nbetween a first-rate fantail and the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a breed may be retained for some particular quality in a\r\nnearly unaltered condition in the same country, together with highly\r\nmodified offshoots or sub-breeds, which are valued for some distinct\r\nproperty. We see this exemplified in England, where the common tumbler,\r\nwhich is valued only for its flight, does not differ much from its\r\nparent-form, the Eastern tumbler; whereas the short-faced tumbler has been\r\nprodigiously modified, from being valued, not for its flight, but for other\r\nqualities. But the common-flying tumbler of Europe has already begun to\r\nbranch out into slightly different sub-breeds, such as the common English\r\ntumbler, the Dutch roller, the Glasgow house-tumbler, and the long-faced\r\nbeard tumbler, &c.; and in the course of centuries, unless fashions greatly\r\nchange, these sub-breeds will diverge through the slow and insensible\r\nprocess of unconscious selection, and become modified, in a greater and\r\ngreater degree. After a time the perfectly graduated links, which now\r\nconnect all these sub-breeds together, will be lost, for there would be no\r\nobject and much difficulty in retaining such a host of intermediate\r\nsub-varieties.\r\n\r\nThe principle of divergence, together with the extinction of the many\r\npreviously existing intermediate forms, is so important for understanding\r\nthe origin of domestic races, as well as of species in a state of nature,\r\nthat I will enlarge a little more on this subject. Our third main group\r\nincludes carriers, barbs, and runts, which are plainly related to each\r\nother, yet wonderfully distinct in several important characters. According\r\nto the view given in the last chapter, these three races have probably\r\ndescended from an unknown race having an intermediate character, and this\r\nfrom the rock-pigeon. Their characteristic differences are believed to be\r\ndue to different breeders having at an early period admired different\r\npoints of structure; and then, on the acknowledged principle of admiring\r\nextremes, having gone on breeding, without any thought of the future, as\r\ngood birds as they could,--carrier-fanciers preferring {221} long beaks\r\nwith much wattle,--barb-fanciers preferring short thick beaks with much\r\neye-wattle,--and runt-fanciers not caring about the beak or wattle, but\r\nonly for the size and weight of the body. This process will have led to the\r\nneglect and final extinction of the earlier, inferior, and intermediate\r\nbirds; and thus it has come to pass, that in Europe these three races are\r\nnow so extraordinarily distinct from each other. But in the East, whence\r\nthey were originally brought, the fashion has been different, and we there\r\nsee breeds which connect the highly modified English carrier with the\r\nrock-pigeon, and others which to a certain extent connect carriers and\r\nrunts. Looking back to the time of Aldrovandi, we find that there existed\r\nin Europe, before the year 1600, four breeds which were closely allied to\r\ncarriers and barbs, but which competent authorities cannot now identify\r\nwith our present barbs and carriers; nor can Aldrovandi's runts be\r\nidentified with our present runts. These four breeds certainly did not\r\ndiffer from each other nearly so much as do our existing English carriers,\r\nbarbs, and runts. All this is exactly what might have been anticipated. If\r\nwe could collect all the pigeons which have ever lived, from before the\r\ntime of the Romans to the present day, we should be able to group them in\r\nseveral lines, diverging from the parent rock-pigeon. Each line would\r\nconsist of almost insensible steps, occasionally broken by some slightly\r\ngreater variation or sport, and each would culminate in one of our present\r\nhighly modified forms. Of the many former connecting links, some would be\r\nfound to have become absolutely extinct without having left any issue,\r\nwhilst others though extinct would be seen to be the progenitors of the\r\nexisting races.\r\n\r\nI have heard it remarked as a strange circumstance that we occasionally\r\nhear of the local or complete extinction of domestic races, whilst we hear\r\nnothing of their origin. How, it has been asked, can these losses be\r\ncompensated, and more than compensated, for we know that with almost all\r\ndomesticated animals the races have largely increased in number since the\r\ntime of the Romans? But on the view here given, we can understand this\r\napparent contradiction. The extinction of a race within historical times is\r\nan event likely to be noticed; but its gradual and scarcely sensible\r\nmodification through unconscious selection, {222} and its subsequent\r\ndivergence, either in the same or more commonly in distant countries, into\r\ntwo or more strains, and their gradual conversion into sub-breeds, and\r\nthese into well-marked breeds, are events which would rarely be noticed.\r\nThe death of a tree, that has attained gigantic dimensions, is recorded;\r\nthe slow growth of smaller trees and their increase in number excite no\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the belief of the great power of selection, and of the\r\nlittle direct power of changed conditions of life, except in causing\r\ngeneral variability or plasticity of organisation, it is not surprising\r\nthat dovecot-pigeons have remained unaltered from time immemorial; and that\r\nsome toy-pigeons, which differ in little else besides colour from the\r\ndovecot-pigeon, have retained the same character for several centuries. For\r\nwhen one of these toy-pigeons had once become beautifully and symmetrically\r\ncoloured,--when, for instance, a Spot had been produced with the crown of\r\nits head, its tail, and tail-coverts of a uniform colour, the rest of the\r\nbody being snow-white,--no alteration or improvement would be desired. On\r\nthe other hand, it is not surprising that during this same interval of time\r\nour highly-bred pigeons have undergone an astonishing amount of change; for\r\nin regard to them there is no defined limit to the wish of the fancier, and\r\nthere is no known limit to the variability of their characters. What is\r\nthere to stop the fancier desiring to give to his carrier a longer and\r\nlonger beak, or to his tumbler a shorter and shorter beak? nor has the\r\nextreme limit of variability in the beak, if there be any such limit, as\r\nyet been reached. Notwithstanding the great improvement effected within\r\nrecent times in the short-faced almond tumbler, Mr. Eaton remarks, \"the\r\nfield is still as open for fresh competitors as it was one hundred years\r\nago;\" but this is perhaps an exaggerated assertion, for the young of all\r\nhighly improved fancy birds are extremely liable to disease and death.\r\n\r\nI have heard it objected that the formation of the several domestic races\r\nof the pigeon throws no light on the origin of the wild species of the\r\nColumbidæ, because their differences are not of the same nature. The\r\ndomestic races for instance do not differ, or differ hardly at all, in the\r\nrelative lengths and shapes of the primary wing-feathers, in the relative\r\nlength of the hind {223} toe, or in habits of life, as in roosting and\r\nbuilding in trees. But the above objection shows how completely the\r\nprinciple of selection has been misunderstood. It is not likely that\r\ncharacters selected by the caprice of man should resemble differences\r\npreserved under natural conditions, either from being of direct service to\r\neach species, or from standing in correlation with other modified and\r\nserviceable structures. Until man selects birds differing in the relative\r\nlength of the wing-feathers or toes, &c., no sensible change in these parts\r\nshould be expected. Nor could man do anything unless these parts happened\r\nto vary under domestication: I do not positively assert that this is the\r\ncase, although I have seen traces of such variability in the wing-feathers,\r\nand certainly in the tail-feathers. It would be a strange fact if the\r\nrelative length of the hind toe should never vary, seeing how variable the\r\nfoot is both in size and in the number of the scutellæ. With respect to the\r\ndomestic races not roosting or building in trees, it is obvious that\r\nfanciers would never attend to or select such changes in habits; but we\r\nhave seen that the pigeons in Egypt, which do not for some reason like\r\nsettling on the low mud hovels of the natives, are led, apparently by\r\ncompulsion, to perch in crowds on the trees. We may even affirm that, if\r\nour domestic races had become greatly modified in any of the above\r\nspecified respects, and it could be shown that fanciers had never attended\r\nto such points, or that they did not stand in correlation with other\r\nselected characters, the fact, on the principles advocated in this chapter,\r\nwould have offered a serious difficulty.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly sum up the last two chapters on the pigeon. We may conclude\r\nwith confidence that all the domestic races, notwithstanding their great\r\namount of difference, are descended from the _Columba livia_, including\r\nunder this name certain wild races. But the differences between these\r\nlatter forms throw no light whatever on the characters which distinguish\r\nthe domestic races. In each breed or sub-breed the individual birds are\r\nmore variable than birds in a state of nature; and occasionally they vary\r\nin a sudden and strongly-marked manner. This plasticity of organisation\r\napparently results from changed conditions of life. Disuse has reduced\r\ncertain parts of the body. Correlation of growth so ties the organisation\r\ntogether, that when one part varies other parts {224} vary at the same\r\ntime. When several breeds have once been formed, their intercrossing aids\r\nthe progress of modification, and has even produced new sub-breeds. But as,\r\nin the construction of a building, mere stones or bricks are of little\r\navail without the builder's art, so, in the production of new races,\r\nselection has been the presiding power. Fanciers can act by selection on\r\nexcessively slight individual differences, as well as on those greater\r\ndifferences which are called sports. Selection is followed methodically\r\nwhen the fancier tries to improve and modify a breed according to a\r\nprefixed standard of excellence; or he acts unmethodically and\r\nunconsciously, by merely trying to rear as good birds as he can, without\r\nany wish or intention to alter the breed. The progress of selection almost\r\ninevitably leads to the neglect and ultimate extinction of the earlier and\r\nless improved forms, as well as of many intermediate links in each long\r\nline of descent. Thus it has come to pass that most of our present races\r\nare so marvellously distinct from each other, and from the aboriginal\r\nrock-pigeon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{225}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFOWLS.\r\n\r\n    BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CHIEF BREEDS--ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THEIR\r\n    DESCENT FROM SEVERAL SPECIES--ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF ALL THE BREEDS\r\n    HAVING DESCENDED FROM GALLUS BANKIVA--REVERSION TO THE PARENT-STOCK IN\r\n    COLOUR--ANALOGOUS VARIATIONS--ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE FOWL--EXTERNAL\r\n    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL BREEDS--EGGS--CHICKENS--SECONDARY\r\n    SEXUAL CHARACTERS--WING- AND TAIL-FEATHERS, VOICE, DISPOSITION,\r\n    ETC.--OSTEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE SKULL, VERTEBRÆ, ETC.--EFFECTS OF\r\n    USE AND DISUSE ON CERTAIN PARTS--CORRELATION OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nAs some naturalists may not be familiar with the chief breeds of the fowl,\r\nit will be advisable to give a condensed description of them.[361] From\r\nwhat I have read and seen of specimens brought from several quarters of the\r\nworld, I believe that most of the chief kinds have been imported into\r\nEngland, but many sub-breeds are probably still here unknown. The following\r\ndiscussion on the origin of the various breeds and on their characteristic\r\ndifferences does not pretend to completeness, but may be of some interest\r\nto the naturalist. The classification of the breeds cannot, as far as I can\r\nsee, be made natural. They differ from each other in different degrees, and\r\ndo not afford characters in subordination to each other, by which they can\r\nbe ranked in group under group. They seem all to have diverged by\r\nindependent and different roads from a single type. Each chief breed\r\nincludes differently coloured sub-varieties, most of which can be truly\r\npropagated, but it would be superfluous to describe them. I have classed\r\nthe various crested fowls {226} as sub-breeds under the Polish fowl; but I\r\nhave great doubts whether this is a natural arrangement, showing true\r\naffinity or blood relationship. It is scarcely possible to avoid laying\r\nstress on the commonness of a breed; and if certain foreign sub-breeds had\r\nbeen largely kept in this country they would perhaps have been raised to\r\nthe rank of main-breeds. Several breeds are abnormal in character; that is,\r\nthey differ in certain points from all wild Gallinaceous birds. At first I\r\nmade a division of the breeds into normal and abnormal, but the result was\r\nwholly unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Spanish Fowl.]\r\n\r\n    1. GAME BREED.--This may be considered as the typical breed, as it\r\n    deviates only slightly from the wild _Gallus bankiva_, or, as perhaps\r\n    more correctly named, _ferrugineus_. Beak strong; comb single and\r\n    upright. Spurs long and sharp. Feathers closely adpressed to the body.\r\n    Tail with the normal number of 14 feathers. Eggs often pale-buff.\r\n    Disposition {227} indomitably courageous, exhibited even in the hens\r\n    and chickens. An unusual number of differently coloured varieties\r\n    exist, such as black and brown-breasted reds, duckwings, blacks,\r\n    whites, piles, &c., with their legs of various colours.\r\n\r\n    2. MALAY BREED.--Body of great size, with head, neck, and legs\r\n    elongated; carriage erect; tail small, sloping downwards, generally\r\n    formed of 16 feathers; comb and wattle small; ear-lobe and face red;\r\n    skin yellowish; feathers closely adpressed to the body; neck-hackles\r\n    short, narrow, and hard. Eggs often pale buff. Chickens feather late.\r\n    Disposition savage. Of Eastern origin.\r\n\r\n    3. COCHIN, OR SHANGAI BREED.--Size great; wing-feathers short, arched,\r\n    much hidden in the soft downy plumage; barely capable of flight; tail\r\n    short, generally formed of 16 feathers, developed at a late period in\r\n    the young males; legs thick, feathered; spurs short, thick; nail of\r\n    middle toe flat and broad; an additional toe not rarely developed; skin\r\n    yellowish. Comb and wattle well developed. Skull with deep medial\r\n    furrow; occipital foramen, sub-triangular, vertically elongated. Voice\r\n    peculiar. Eggs rough, buff-coloured. Disposition extremely quiet. Of\r\n    Chinese origin.\r\n\r\n    4. DORKING BREED.--Size great; body square, compact; feet with an\r\n    additional toe; comb well developed, but varies much in form; wattles\r\n    well developed; colour of plumage various. Skull remarkably broad\r\n    between the orbits. Of English origin.\r\n\r\n    The white Dorking may be considered as a distinct sub-breed, being a\r\n    less massive bird.\r\n\r\n    5. SPANISH BREED.--Tall, with stately carriage; tarsi long; comb\r\n    single, deeply serrated, of immense size; wattles largely developed;\r\n    the large ear-lobes and sides of face white. Plumage black glossed with\r\n    green. Do not incubate. Tender in constitution, the comb being often\r\n    injured by frost. Eggs white, smooth, of large size. Chickens feather\r\n    late, but the young cocks show their masculine characters, and crow at\r\n    an early age. Of Mediterranean origin.\r\n\r\n    The _Andalusians_ may be ranked as a sub-breed: they are of a slaty\r\n    blue colour, and their chickens are well feathered. A smaller,\r\n    short-legged Dutch sub-breed has been described by some authors as\r\n    distinct.\r\n\r\n    6. HAMBURGH BREED (fig. 31).--Size moderate; comb flat, produced\r\n    backwards, covered with numerous small points; wattle of moderate\r\n    dimensions; ear-lobe white; legs blueish, thin. Do not incubate. Skull,\r\n    with the tips of the ascending branches of the premaxillary and with\r\n    the nasal bones standing a little separate from each other; anterior\r\n    margin of the frontal bones less depressed than usual.\r\n\r\n    There are two sub-breeds; the _spangled_ Hamburgh, of English origin,\r\n    with the tips of the feathers marked with a dark spot; and the\r\n    _pencilled_ Hamburgh, of Dutch origin, with dark transverse lines\r\n    across each feather, and with the body rather smaller. Both these\r\n    sub-breeds include gold and silver varieties, as well as some other\r\n    sub-varieties. Black Hamburghs have been produced by a cross with the\r\n    Spanish breed.\r\n\r\n    7. CRESTED OR POLISH BREED (fig. 32).--Head with a large, rounded crest\r\n    of feathers, supported on a hemispherical protuberance of the frontal\r\n    bones, {228} which includes the anterior part of the brain. The\r\n    ascending branches of the premaxillary bones and the inner nasal\r\n    processes are much shortened. The orifice of the nostrils raised and\r\n    crescentic. Beak short. Comb absent, or small and of crescentic shape;\r\n    wattles either present or replaced by a beard-like tuft of feathers.\r\n    Legs leaden-blue. Sexual differences appear late in life. Do not\r\n    incubate. There are several beautiful varieties which differ in colour\r\n    and slightly in other respects.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Hamburgh Fowl.]\r\n\r\n    The following sub-breeds agree in having a crest, more or less\r\n    developed, with the comb, when present, of crescentic shape. The skull\r\n    presents nearly the same remarkable peculiarities of structure as in\r\n    the true Polish fowl.\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed (_a_) _Sultans_.--A Turkish breed, resembling white Polish\r\n    fowls, with a large crest and beard, with short and well-feathered\r\n    legs. The tail is furnished with additional sickle feathers. Do not\r\n    incubate.[362]\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed (_b_) _Ptarmigans_.--An inferior breed closely allied to the\r\n    last, white, rather small, legs much feathered, with the crest pointed;\r\n    comb small, cupped; wattles small.\r\n\r\n    {229}\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed (_c_) _Ghoondooks_.--Another Turkish breed having an\r\n    extraordinary appearance; black and tailless; crest and beard large;\r\n    legs feathered. The inner processes of the two nasal bones come into\r\n    contact with each other, owing to the complete absorption of the\r\n    ascending branches of the premaxillaries. I have seen an allied, white,\r\n    tailless breed from Turkey.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--Polish Fowl.]\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed (_d_) _Crève-coeur_.--A French breed of large size, barely\r\n    capable of flight, with short black legs, head crested, comb produced\r\n    into two points or horns, sometimes a little branched like the horns of\r\n    a stag; both beard and wattles present. Eggs large. Disposition\r\n    quiet.[363]\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed (_e_) _Horned fowl_.--With a small crest; comb produced into\r\n    two great points, supported on two bony protuberances.\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed (_f_) _Houdan_.--A French breed; of moderate size,\r\n    short-legged with five toes, wings well developed; plumage invariably\r\n    mottled with {230} black, white, and straw-yellow; head furnished with\r\n    a crest, and a triple comb placed transversely; both wattles and beard\r\n    present.[364]\r\n\r\n    Sub-breed (_g_) _Guelderlands_.--No comb, head said to be surmounted by\r\n    a longitudinal crest of soft velvety feathers; nostrils said to be\r\n    crescentic; wattles well developed; legs feathered; colour black. From\r\n    North America. The Breda fowl seems to be closely allied to the\r\n    Guelderland.\r\n\r\n    8. BANTAM BREED.--Originally from Japan,[365] characterized by small\r\n    size alone; carriage bold and erect. There are several sub-breeds, such\r\n    as the Cochin, Game, and Sebright Bantams, some of which have been\r\n    recently formed by various crosses. The Black Bantam has a differently\r\n    shaped skull, with the occipital foramen like that of the Cochin fowl.\r\n\r\n    9. RUMP-LESS FOWLS.--These are so variable in character[366] that they\r\n    hardly deserve to be called a breed. Any one who will examine the\r\n    caudal vertebræ will see how monstrous the breed is.\r\n\r\n    10. CREEPERS OR JUMPERS.--These are characterized by an almost\r\n    monstrous shortness of legs, so that they move by jumping rather than\r\n    by walking; they are said not to scratch up the ground. I have examined\r\n    a Burmese variety, which had a skull of rather unusual shape.\r\n\r\n    11. FRIZZLED OR CAFFRE FOWLS.--Not uncommon in India, with the feathers\r\n    curling backwards, and with the primary feathers of the wing and tail\r\n    imperfect; periosteum of bones black.\r\n\r\n    12. SILK FOWLS.--Feathers silky, with the primary wing and\r\n    tail-feathers imperfect; skin and periosteum of bones black; comb and\r\n    wattles dark leaden-blue; ear-lappets tinged with blue; legs thin,\r\n    often furnished with an additional toe. Size rather small.\r\n\r\n    13. SOOTY FOWLS.--An Indian breed, of a white colour stained with soot,\r\n    with black skin and periosteum. The hens alone are thus characterized.\r\n\r\nFrom this synopsis we see that the several breeds differ considerably, and\r\nthey would have been nearly as interesting for us as pigeons, if there had\r\nbeen equally good evidence that all had descended from one parent-species.\r\nMost fanciers believe that they are descended from several primitive\r\nstocks. The Rev. E. S. Dixon[367] argues strongly on this side of the\r\nquestion; and one fancier even denounces the opposite conclusion by asking,\r\n\"Do we not perceive pervading this spirit, the spirit of the _Deist_?\" Most\r\nnaturalists, with the exception of a few, such as Temminck, believe that\r\nall the breeds have proceeded from a single species; but authority on such\r\na point {231} goes for little. Fanciers look to all parts of the world as\r\nthe possible sources of their unknown stocks; thus ignoring the laws of\r\ngeographical distribution. They know well that the several kinds breed\r\ntruly even in colour. They assert, but, as we shall see, on very weak\r\ngrounds, that most of the breeds are extremely ancient. They are strongly\r\nimpressed with the great difference between the chief kinds, and they ask\r\nwith force, can differences in climate, food, or treatment have produced\r\nbirds so different as the black stately Spanish, the diminutive elegant\r\nBantam, the heavy Cochin with its many peculiarities, and the Polish fowl\r\nwith its great top-knot and protuberant skull? But fanciers, whilst\r\nadmitting and even overrating the effects of crossing the various breeds,\r\ndo not sufficiently regard the probability of the occasional birth, during\r\nthe course of centuries, of birds with abnormal and hereditary\r\npeculiarities; they overlook the effects of correlation of growth--of the\r\nlong-continued use and disuse of parts, and of some direct result from\r\nchanged food and climate, though on this latter head I have found no\r\nsufficient evidence; and lastly, they all, as far as I know, entirely\r\noverlook the all-important subject of unconscious or unmethodical\r\nselection, though they are well aware that their birds differ individually,\r\nand that by selecting the best birds for a few generations they can improve\r\ntheir stocks.\r\n\r\nAn amateur writes[368] as follows. \"The fact that poultry have until lately\r\nreceived but little attention at the hands of the fancier, and been\r\nentirely confined to the domains of the producer for the market, would\r\nalone suggest the improbability of that constant and unremitting attention\r\nhaving been observed in breeding, which is requisite to the consummating,\r\nin the offspring of any two birds, transmittable forms not exhibited by the\r\nparents.\" This at first sight appears true. But in a future chapter on\r\nSelection, abundant facts will be given showing not only that careful\r\nbreeding, but that actual selection was practised during ancient periods,\r\nand by barely civilised races of man. In the case of the fowl I can adduce\r\nno direct facts showing that selection was anciently practised; but the\r\nRomans at the commencement of the Christian era kept six or seven breeds,\r\nand Columella \"particularly recommends as the best, those sorts {232} that\r\nhave five toes and white ears.\"[369] In the fifteenth century several\r\nbreeds were known and described in Europe; and in China, at nearly the same\r\nperiod, seven kinds were named. A more striking case is that at present, in\r\none of the Philippine Islands, the semi-barbarous inhabitants have distinct\r\nnative names for no less than nine sub-breeds of the Game Fowl.[370]\r\nAzara,[371] who wrote towards the close of the last century, states that in\r\nthe interior parts of South America, where I should not have expected that\r\nthe least care would have been taken of poultry, a black-skinned and\r\nblack-boned breed is kept, from being considered fertile and its flesh good\r\nfor sick persons. Now every one who has kept poultry knows how impossible\r\nit is to keep several breeds distinct unless the utmost care be taken in\r\nseparating the sexes. Will it then be pretended that those persons who in\r\nancient times and in semi-civilized countries took pains to keep the breeds\r\ndistinct, and who therefore valued them, would not occasionally have\r\ndestroyed inferior birds and occasionally have preserved their best birds?\r\nThis is all that is required. It is not pretended that any one in ancient\r\ntimes intended to form a new breed, or to modify an old breed according to\r\nsome ideal standard of excellence. He who cared for poultry would merely\r\nwish to obtain, and afterwards to rear, the best birds which he could; but\r\nthis occasional preservation of the best birds would in the course of time\r\nmodify the breed, as surely, though by no means as rapidly, as does\r\nmethodical selection at the present day. If one person out of a hundred or\r\nout of a thousand attended to the breeding of his birds, this would be\r\nsufficient; for the birds thus tended would soon become superior to others,\r\nand would form a new strain; and this strain would, as explained in the\r\nlast chapter, slowly have its characteristic differences augmented, and at\r\nlast be converted into a new sub-breed or breed. But breeds would often be\r\nfor a time neglected and would deteriorate; they would, however, partially\r\nretain their character, and afterwards might again come into fashion and be\r\nraised to a standard of perfection {233} higher than their former standard;\r\nas has actually occurred quite recently with Polish fowls. If, however, a\r\nbreed were utterly neglected, it would become extinct, as has recently\r\nhappened with one of the Polish sub-breeds. Whenever in the course of past\r\ncenturies a bird appeared with some slight abnormal structure, such as with\r\na lark-like crest on its head, it would probably often have been preserved\r\nfrom that love of novelty which leads some persons in England to keep\r\nrump-less fowls, and others in India to keep frizzled fowls. And after a\r\ntime any such abnormal appearance would be carefully preserved, from being\r\nesteemed a sign of the purity and excellence of the breed; for on this\r\nprinciple the Romans eighteen centuries ago valued the fifth toe and the\r\nwhite ear-lobe in their fowls.\r\n\r\nThus from the occasional appearance of abnormal characters, though at first\r\nonly slight in degree; from the effects of the use and the disuse of parts;\r\npossibly from the direct effects of changed climate and food; from\r\ncorrelation of growth; from occasional reversions to old and long-lost\r\ncharacters; from the crossing of breeds, when more than one had once been\r\nformed; but, above all, from unconscious selection carried on during many\r\ngenerations, there is no insuperable difficulty, to the best of my\r\njudgment, in believing that all the breeds have descended from some one\r\nparent-source. Can any single species be named from which we may reasonably\r\nsuppose that all have descended? The _Gallus bankiva_ apparently fulfils\r\nevery requirement. I have already given as fair an account as I could of\r\nthe arguments in favour of the multiple origin of the several breeds; and\r\nnow I will give those in favour of their common descent from _G. bankiva_.\r\n\r\n    But it will be convenient first briefly to describe all the known\r\n    species of Gallus. The _G. Sonneratii_ does not range into the northern\r\n    parts of India; according to Colonel Sykes,[372] it presents at\r\n    different heights on the Ghauts, two strongly marked varieties, perhaps\r\n    deserving to be called species. It was at one time thought to be the\r\n    primitive stock of all our domestic breeds, and this shows that it\r\n    closely approaches the common fowl in general structure; but its\r\n    hackles partially consist of highly peculiar, horny laminæ,\r\n    transversely banded with three colours; and I have met with no\r\n    authentic account of any such character having been observed {234} in\r\n    any domestic breed.[373] This species also differs greatly from the\r\n    common fowl, in the comb being finely serrated, and in the loins being\r\n    destitute of true hackles. Its voice is utterly different. It crosses\r\n    readily in India with domestic hens; and Mr. Blyth [374] raised nearly\r\n    100 hybrid chickens; but they were tender and mostly died whilst young.\r\n    Those which were reared were absolutely sterile when crossed _inter\r\n    se_, or with either parent. At the Zoological Gardens, however, some\r\n    hybrids of the same parentage were not quite so sterile: Mr. Dixon, as\r\n    he informed me, made, with Mr. Yarrell's aid, particular inquiries on\r\n    this subject, and was assured that out of 50 eggs only five or six\r\n    chickens were reared. Some, however, of these half-bred birds were\r\n    crossed with one of their parents, namely, a Bantam, and produced a few\r\n    extremely feeble chickens. Mr. Dixon also procured some of these same\r\n    birds and crossed them in several ways, but all were more or less\r\n    infertile. Nearly similar experiments have recently been tried on a\r\n    great scale in the Zoological Gardens with almost the same result.[375]\r\n    Out of 500 eggs, raised from various first crosses and hybrids, between\r\n    _G. Sonneratii, bankiva_, and _varius_, only 12 chickens were reared,\r\n    and of these only three were the product of hybrids _inter se_. From\r\n    these facts, and from the above-mentioned strongly-marked differences\r\n    in structure between the domestic fowl and _G. Sonneratii_, we may\r\n    reject this latter species as the parent of any domestic breed.\r\n\r\n    Ceylon possesses a fowl peculiar to the island, viz. _G. Stanleyii_;\r\n    this species approaches so closely (except in the colouring of the\r\n    comb) to the domestic fowl, that Messrs. E. Layard and Kellaert[376]\r\n    would have considered it, as they inform me, as one of the\r\n    parent-stocks, had it not been for its singularly different voice. This\r\n    bird, like the last, crosses readily with tame hens, and even visits\r\n    solitary farms and ravishes them. Two hybrids, a male and female, thus\r\n    produced, were found by Mr. Mitford to be quite sterile: both inherited\r\n    the peculiar voice of _G. Stanleyii_. This species, then, may in all\r\n    probability be rejected as one of the primitive stocks of the domestic\r\n    fowl.\r\n\r\n    Java and the islands eastward as far as Flores are inhabited by _G.\r\n    varius_ (or _furcatus_), which differs in so many characters--green\r\n    plumage, unserrated comb, and single median wattle--that no one\r\n    supposes it to have been the parent of any one of our breeds; yet, as I\r\n    am informed by Mr. Crawfurd,[377] hybrids are commonly raised between\r\n    the male _G. varius_ and the common hen, and are kept for their great\r\n    beauty, but are invariably sterile; this, however, was not the case\r\n    with some bred in the Zoological Gardens. These hybrids were at one\r\n    time thought to {235} be specifically distinct, and were named _G.\r\n    æneus_. Mr. Blyth and others believe that the _G. Temminckii_[378] (of\r\n    which the history is not known) is a similar hybrid. Sir J. Brooke sent\r\n    me some skins of domestic fowls from Borneo, and across the tail of one\r\n    of these, as Mr. Tegetmeier observed, there were transverse blue bands\r\n    like those which he had seen on the tail-feathers of hybrids from _G.\r\n    varius_, reared in the Zoological Gardens. This fact apparently\r\n    indicates that some of the fowls of Borneo have been slightly affected\r\n    by crosses with _G. varius_, but the case may possibly be one of\r\n    analogous variation. I may just allude to the _G. giganteus_, so often\r\n    referred to in works on poultry as a wild species; but Marsden,[379]\r\n    the first describer, speaks of it as a tame breed; and the specimen in\r\n    the British Museum evidently has the aspect of a domestic variety.\r\n\r\n    The last species to be mentioned, namely, _Gallus bankiva_, has a much\r\n    wider geographical range than the three previous species; it inhabits\r\n    Northern India as far west as Sinde, and ascends the Himalaya to a\r\n    height of 4000 ft.; it inhabits Burmah, the Malay peninsula, the\r\n    Indo-Chinese countries, the Philippine Islands, and the Malayan\r\n    archipelago as far eastward as Timor. This species varies considerably\r\n    in the wild state. Mr. Blyth informs me that the specimens, both male\r\n    and female, brought from near the Himalaya, are rather paler coloured\r\n    than those from other parts of India; whilst those from the Malay\r\n    peninsula and Java are brighter coloured than the Indian birds. I have\r\n    seen specimens from these countries, and the difference of tint in the\r\n    hackles was conspicuous. The Malayan hens were a shade redder on the\r\n    breast and neck than the Indian hens. The Malayan males generally had a\r\n    red ear-lappet, instead of a white one as in India; but Mr. Blyth has\r\n    seen one Indian specimen without the white ear-lappet. The legs are\r\n    leaden blue in the Indian, whereas they show some tendency to be\r\n    yellowish in the Malayan and Javan specimens. In the former Mr. Blyth\r\n    finds the tarsus remarkably variable in length. According to\r\n    Temminck[380] the Timor specimens differ as a local race from that of\r\n    Java. These several wild varieties have not as yet been ranked as\r\n    distinct species; if they should, as is not unlikely, be hereafter thus\r\n    ranked, the circumstance would be quite immaterial as far as the\r\n    parentage and differences of our domestic breeds are concerned. The\r\n    wild _G. bankiva_ agrees most closely with the black-breasted red\r\n    Game-breed, in colouring and in all other respects, except in being\r\n    smaller, and in the tail being carried more horizontally. But the\r\n    manner in which the tail is carried is highly variable in many of our\r\n    breeds, for, as Mr. Brent informs me, the tail slopes much in the\r\n    Malays, is erect in the Games and some other breeds, and is more than\r\n    erect in Dorkings, Bantams, &c. There is one other difference, namely,\r\n    that in _G. bankiva_, according to Mr. Blyth, the neck-hackles when\r\n    first moulted are replaced during two or three months, not by other\r\n    {236} hackles, as with our domestic poultry, but by short blackish\r\n    feathers.[381] Mr. Brent, however, has remarked that these black\r\n    feathers remain in the wild bird after the development of the lower\r\n    hackles, and appear in the domestic bird at the same time with them; so\r\n    that the only difference is that the lower hackles are replaced more\r\n    slowly in the wild than in the tame bird; but as confinement is known\r\n    sometimes to affect the masculine plumage, this slight difference\r\n    cannot be considered of any importance. It is a significant fact that\r\n    the voice of both the male and female _G. bankiva_ closely resembles,\r\n    as Mr. Blyth and others have noted, the voice of both sexes of the\r\n    common domestic fowl; but the last note of the crow of the wild bird is\r\n    rather less prolonged. Captain Hutton, well known for his researches\r\n    into the natural history of India, informs me that he has seen several\r\n    crossed fowls from the wild species and the Chinese bantam; these\r\n    crossed fowls _bred freely_ with bantams, but unfortunately were not\r\n    crossed _inter se_. Captain Hutton reared chickens from the eggs of the\r\n    _Gallus bankiva_; and these, though at first very wild, afterwards\r\n    became so tame that they would crowd round his feet. He did not succeed\r\n    in rearing them to maturity; but, as he remarks, \"no wild gallinaceous\r\n    bird thrives well at first on hard grain.\" Mr. Blyth also found much\r\n    difficulty in keeping _G. bankiva_ in confinement. In the Philippine\r\n    Islands, however, the natives must succeed better, as they keep wild\r\n    cocks to fight with their domestic game-birds.[382] Sir Walter Elliot\r\n    informs me that the hen of a native domestic breed of Pegu is\r\n    undistinguishable from the hen of the wild _G. bankiva_; and the\r\n    natives constantly catch wild cocks by taking tame cocks to fight with\r\n    them in the woods.[383] Mr. Crawfurd remarks that from etymology it\r\n    might be argued that the fowl was first domesticated by the Malays and\r\n    Javanese.[384] It is also a curious fact, of which I have been assured\r\n    by Mr. Blyth, that wild specimens of the _Gallus bankiva_, brought from\r\n    the countries east of the Bay of Bengal, are far more easily tamed than\r\n    those of India; nor is this an unparalleled fact, for, as Humboldt long\r\n    ago remarked, the same species sometimes evinces a more tameable\r\n    disposition in one country than in another. If we suppose that the _G.\r\n    bankiva_ was first tamed in Malaya and afterwards imported into India,\r\n    we can understand an observation made to me by Mr. Blyth, that the\r\n    domestic fowls of India do not resemble the wild _G. bankiva_ more\r\n    closely than do those of Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom the extremely close resemblance in colour, general structure, and\r\nespecially in voice, between _Gallus bankiva_ and the Game fowl; from their\r\nfertility, as far as this has been ascertained, when crossed; from the\r\npossibility of the wild species being tamed, and from its varying in the\r\nwild state, we may confidently look at it as the parent of the most typical\r\nof all the {237} domestic breeds, namely, the Game-fowl. It is a\r\nsignificant fact, that almost all the naturalists in India, namely, Sir W.\r\nElliot, Mr. S. N. Ward, Mr. Layard, Mr. J. C. Jerdon, and Mr. Blyth,[385]\r\nwho are familiar with _G. bankiva_, believe that it is the parent of most\r\nor all our domestic breeds. But even if it be admitted that _G. bankiva_ is\r\nthe parent of the Game breed, yet it may be urged that other wild species\r\nhave been the parents of the other domestic breeds; and that these species\r\nstill exist, though unknown, in some country, or have become extinct. The\r\nextinction, however, of several species of fowls, is an improbable\r\nhypothesis, seeing that the four known species have not become extinct in\r\nthe most anciently and thickly peopled regions of the East. There is, in\r\nfact, only one kind of domesticated bird, namely, the Chinese goose or\r\n_Anser cygnoides_, of which the wild parent-form is said to be still\r\nunknown, or extinct. For the discovery of new, or the rediscovery of old\r\nspecies of Gallus, we must not look, as fanciers often look, to the whole\r\nworld. The larger gallinaceous birds, as Mr. Blyth has remarked,[386]\r\ngenerally have a restricted range: we see this well illustrated in India,\r\nwhere the genus Gallus inhabits the base of the Himalaya, and is succeeded\r\nhigher up by Gallophasis, and still higher up by Phasianus. Australia, with\r\nits islands, is out of the question as the home for unknown species of the\r\ngenus. It is, also, as improbable that Gallus should inhabit South\r\nAmerica[387] as that a humming-bird should be found in the Old World. From\r\nthe character of the other gallinaceous {238} birds of Africa, it is not\r\nprobable that Gallus is an African genus. We need not look to the western\r\nparts of Asia, for Messrs. Blyth and Crawfurd, who have attended to this\r\nsubject, doubt whether Gallus ever existed in a wild state even as far west\r\nas Persia. Although the earliest Greek writers speak of the fowl as a\r\nPersian bird, this probably merely indicates its line of importation. For\r\nthe discovery of unknown species we must look to India, to the Indo-Chinese\r\ncountries, and to the northern parts of the Malay Archipelago. The southern\r\nportion of China is the most likely country; but as Mr. Blyth informs me,\r\nskins have been exported from China during a long period, and living birds\r\nare largely kept there in aviaries, so that any native species of Gallus\r\nwould probably have become known. Mr. Birch, of the British Museum, has\r\ntranslated for me passages from a Chinese Encyclopædia published in 1609,\r\nbut compiled from more ancient documents, in which it is said that fowls\r\nare creatures of the West, and were introduced into the East (_i.e._ China)\r\nin a dynasty 1400 B.C. Whatever may be thought of so ancient a date, we see\r\nthat the Indo-Chinese and Indian regions were formerly considered by the\r\nChinese as the source of the domestic fowl. From these several\r\nconsiderations we must look to the present metropolis of the genus, namely,\r\nto the south-eastern parts of Asia, for the discovery of species which were\r\nformerly domesticated, but are now unknown in the wild state; and the most\r\nexperienced ornithologists do not consider it probable that such species\r\nwill be discovered.\r\n\r\nIn considering whether the domestic breeds are descended from one species,\r\nnamely, _G. bankiva_, or from several, we must {239} not quite overlook,\r\nthough we must not exaggerate, the importance of the test of fertility.\r\nMost of our domestic breeds have been so often crossed, and their mongrels\r\nso largely kept, that it is almost certain, if any degree of infertility\r\nhad existed between them, it would have been detected. On the other hand,\r\nthe four known species of Gallus when crossed with each other, or when\r\ncrossed, with the exception of _G. bankiva_, with the domestic fowl,\r\nproduce infertile hybrids.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have not such good evidence with fowls as with pigeons, of all\r\nthe breeds having descended from a single primitive stock. In both cases\r\nthe argument of fertility must go for something; in both we have the\r\nimprobability of man having succeeded in ancient times in thoroughly\r\ndomesticating several supposed species,--most of these supposed species\r\nbeing extremely abnormal as compared with their natural allies,--all being\r\nnow either unknown or extinct, though the parent-form of scarcely any other\r\ndomesticated bird has been lost. But in searching for the supposed\r\nparent-stocks of the various breeds of the pigeon, we were enabled to\r\nconfine our search to species having peculiar habits of life; whilst with\r\nfowls there is nothing in their habits in any marked manner distinct from\r\nthose of other gallinaceous birds. In the case of pigeons, I have shown\r\nthat purely-bred birds of every race and the crossed offspring of distinct\r\nraces frequently resemble, or revert to, the wild rock-pigeon in general\r\ncolour and in each characteristic mark. With fowls we have facts of a\r\nsimilar nature, but less strongly pronounced, which we will now discuss.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reversion and Analogous Variation._--Purely-bred Game, Malay, Cochin,\r\nDorking, Bantam, and, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, Silk fowls, may\r\nfrequently or occasionally be met with, which are almost identical in\r\nplumage with the wild _G. bankiva_. This is a fact well deserving\r\nattention, when we reflect that these breeds rank amongst the most\r\ndistinct. Fowls thus coloured are called by amateurs black-breasted reds.\r\nHamburghs properly have a very different plumage; nevertheless, as Mr.\r\nTegetmeier informs me, \"the great difficulty in breeding cocks of the\r\ngolden-spangled variety is their tendency to have black breasts and red\r\nbacks.\" The males of white Bantams and {240} white Cochins, as they come to\r\nmaturity, often assume a yellowish or saffron tinge; and the longer neck\r\nhackles of black bantam cocks,[388] when two or three years old, not\r\nuncommonly become ruddy; these latter bantams occasionally \"even moult\r\nbrassy winged, or actually red shouldered.\" So that in these several cases\r\nwe see a plain tendency to reversion to the hues of _G. bankiva_, even\r\ndaring the lifetime of the individual bird. With Spanish, Polish, pencilled\r\nHamburgh, silver-spangled Hamburgh fowls, and with some other less common\r\nbreeds, I have never heard of a black-breasted red bird having appeared.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience with pigeons, I made the following crosses. I first\r\nkilled all my own poultry, no others living near my house, and then\r\nprocured, by Mr. Tegetmeier's assistance, a first-rate black Spanish cock,\r\nand hens of the following pure breeds,--white Game, white Cochin,\r\nsilver-spangled Polish, silver-spangled Hamburgh, silver-pencilled\r\nHamburgh, and white Silk. In none of these breeds is there a trace of red,\r\nnor when kept pure have I ever heard of the appearance of a red feather;\r\nthough such an occurrence would perhaps not be very improbable with white\r\nGames and white Cochins. Of the many chickens reared from the above six\r\ncrosses the majority were black, both in the down and in the first plumage;\r\nsome were white, and a very few were mottled black and white. In one lot of\r\neleven mixed eggs from the white Game and white Cochin by the black Spanish\r\ncock, seven of the chickens were white, and only four black: I mention this\r\nfact to show that whiteness of plumage is strongly inherited, and that the\r\nbelief in the prepotent power in the male to transmit his colour is not\r\nalways correct. The chickens were hatched in the spring, and in the latter\r\npart of August several of the young cocks began to exhibit a change, which\r\nwith some of them increased during the following years. Thus a young male\r\nbird from the silver-spangled Polish hen was in its first plumage\r\ncoal-black, and combined in its comb, crest, wattle, and beard, the\r\ncharacters of both parents; but when two years old the secondary\r\nwing-feathers became largely and symmetrically marked with white, and,\r\nwherever in _G. bankiva_ the hackles are red, they were in this bird\r\ngreenish-black along the shaft, narrowly bordered {241} with\r\nbrownish-black, and this again broadly bordered with very pale\r\nyellowish-brown; so that in general appearance the plumage had become\r\npale-coloured instead of black. In this case, with advancing age there was\r\na great change, but no reversion to the red colour of _G. bankiva_.\r\n\r\nA cock with a regular rose comb derived either from the spangled or\r\npencilled silver Hamburgh was likewise at first quite black; but in less\r\nthan a year the neck-hackles, as in the last case, became whitish, whilst\r\nthose on the loins assumed a decided reddish-yellow tint; and here we see\r\nthe first symptom of reversion; this likewise occurred with some other\r\nyoung cocks, which need not here be described. It has also been\r\nrecorded[389] by a breeder, that he crossed two silver-pencilled Hamburgh\r\nhens with a Spanish cock, and reared a number of chickens, all of which\r\nwere black, the cocks having _golden_ and the hens brownish hackles; so\r\nthat in this instance likewise there was a clear tendency to reversion.\r\n\r\nTwo young cocks from my white Game hen were at first snow white; of these,\r\none subsequently assumed pale orange-coloured hackles, chiefly on the\r\nloins, and the other an abundance of fine orange-red hackles on the neck,\r\nloins, and upper wing-coverts. Here again, we have a more decided, though\r\npartial, reversion to the colours of _G. bankiva_. This second cock was in\r\nfact coloured like an inferior \"pile Game cock;\"--now this sub-breed can be\r\nproduced, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, by crossing a black-breasted\r\nred Game cock with a white Game hen, and the \"pile\" sub-breed thus produced\r\ncan afterwards be truly propagated. So that we have the curious fact of the\r\nglossy-black Spanish cock and the black-breasted red Game cock when crossed\r\nwith white Game-hens producing offspring of nearly the same colours.\r\n\r\nI reared several birds from the white Silk-hen by the Spanish cock: all\r\nwere coal-black, and all plainly showed their parentage in having blackish\r\ncombs and bones; none inherited the so-called silky feathers, and the\r\nnon-inheritance of this character has been observed by others. The hens\r\nnever varied in their plumage. As the young cocks grew old, one of them\r\nassumed yellowish-white hackles, and thus resembled in a considerable {242}\r\ndegree the cross from the Hamburgh hen; the other became a gorgeous bird,\r\nso much so that an acquaintance had it preserved and stuffed simply from\r\nits beauty. When stalking about it closely resembled the wild _Gallus\r\nbankiva_, but with the red feathers rather darker. On close comparison one\r\nconsiderable difference presented itself, namely, that the primary and\r\nsecondary wing-feathers were edged with greenish-black, instead of being\r\nedged, as in _G. bankiva_, with fulvous and red tints. The space, also,\r\nacross the back, which bears dark-green feathers, was broader, and the comb\r\nwas blackish. In all other respects, even in trifling details of plumage,\r\nthere was the closest accordance. Altogether it was a marvellous sight to\r\ncompare this bird first with _G. bankiva_, and then with its father, the\r\nglossy green-black Spanish cock, and with its diminutive mother, the white\r\nSilk hen. This case of reversion is the more extraordinary as the Spanish\r\nbreed has long been known to breed true, and no instance is on record of\r\nits throwing a single red feather. The Silk hen likewise breeds true, and\r\nis believed to be ancient, for Aldrovandi, before 1600, alludes probably to\r\nthis breed, and describes it as covered with wool. It is so peculiar in\r\nmany characters that some writers have considered it as specifically\r\ndistinct; yet, as we now see, when crossed with the Spanish fowl, it yields\r\noffspring closely resembling the wild _G. bankiva_.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier has been so kind as to repeat, at my request, the cross\r\nbetween a Spanish cock and Silk hen, and he obtained similar results; for\r\nhe thus raised, besides a black hen, seven cocks, all of which were\r\ndark-bodied with more or less orange-red hackles. In the ensuing year he\r\npaired the black hen with one of her brothers, and raised three young\r\ncocks, all coloured like their father, and a black hen mottled with white.\r\n\r\nThe hens from the six above-described crosses showed hardly any tendency to\r\nrevert to the mottled-brown plumage of the female _G. bankiva_: one hen,\r\nhowever, from the white Cochin, which was at first coal-black, became\r\nslightly brown or sooty. Several hens, which were for a long time\r\nsnow-white, acquired as they grew old a few black feathers. A hen from the\r\nwhite Game, which was for a long time entirely black glossed with green,\r\nwhen two years old had some of the primary wing-feather greyish-white, and\r\na multitude of feathers over her body {243} narrowly and symmetrically\r\ntipped or laced with white. I had expected that some of the chickens whilst\r\ncovered with down would have assumed the longitudinal stripes so general\r\nwith gallinaceous birds; but this did not occur in a single instance. Two\r\nor three alone were reddish-brown about their heads. I was unfortunate in\r\nlosing nearly all the white chickens from the first crosses; so that black\r\nprevailed with the grandchildren; but they were much diversified in colour,\r\nsome being sooty, others mottled, and one blackish chicken had its feathers\r\noddly tipped and barred with brown.\r\n\r\nI will here add a few miscellaneous facts connected with reversion, and\r\nwith the law of analogous variation. This law implies, as stated in a\r\nprevious chapter, that the varieties of one species frequently mock\r\ndistinct but allied species; and this fact is explained, according to the\r\nviews which I maintain, on the principle of allied species having descended\r\nfrom one primitive form. The white Silk fowl with black skin and bones\r\ndegenerates, as has been observed by Mr. Hewitt and Mr. R. Orton, in our\r\nclimate; that is, it reverts to the ordinary colour of the common fowl in\r\nits skin and bones, due care having been taken to prevent any cross. In\r\nGermany[390] a distinct breed with black bones, and with black, not silky\r\nplumage, has likewise been observed to degenerate.\r\n\r\nMr. Tegetmeier informs me that, when distinct breeds are crossed, fowls are\r\nfrequently produced with their feathers marked or pencilled by narrow\r\ntransverse lines of a darker colour. This may be in part explained by\r\ndirect reversion to the parent-form, the Bankiva hen; for this bird has all\r\nits upper plumage finely mottled with dark and rufous brown, with the\r\nmottling partially and obscurely arranged in transverse lines. But the\r\ntendency to pencilling is probably much strengthened by the law of\r\nanalogous variation, for the hens of some other species of Gallus are more\r\nplainly pencilled, and the hens of many gallinaceous birds belonging to\r\nother genera, as the partridge, have pencilled feathers. Mr. Tegetmeier has\r\n{244} also remarked to me, that, although with domestic pigeons we have so\r\ngreat a diversity of colouring, we never see either pencilled or spangled\r\nfeathers; and this fact is intelligible on the law of analogous variation,\r\nas neither the wild rock-pigeon nor any closely-allied species has such\r\nfeathers. The frequent appearance of pencilling in crossed birds probably\r\naccounts for the existence of \"cuckoo\" sub-breeds in the Game, Polish,\r\nDorking, Cochin, Andalusian, and Bantam breeds. The plumage of these birds\r\nis slaty-blue or grey, with each feather transversely barred with darker\r\nlines, so as to resemble in some degree the plumage of the cuckoo. It is a\r\nsingular fact, considering that the male of no species of Gallus is in the\r\nleast barred, that the cuckoo-like plumage has often been transferred to\r\nthe male, more especially in the cuckoo Dorking; and the fact is all the\r\nmore singular, as in gold and silver pencilled Hamburghs, in which\r\npencilling is characteristic of the breed, the male is hardly at all\r\npencilled, this kind of plumage being confined to the female.\r\n\r\nAnother case of analogous variation is the occurrence of spangled\r\nsub-breeds of Hamburgh, Polish, Malay, and Bantam fowls. Spangled feathers\r\nhave a dark mark, properly crescent-shaped, on their tips; whilst pencilled\r\nfeathers have several transverse bars. The spangling cannot be due to\r\nreversion to _G. bankiva_; nor does it often follow, as I hear from Mr.\r\nTegetmeier, from crossing distinct breeds; but it is a case of analogous\r\nvariation, for many gallinaceous birds have spangled feathers,--for\r\ninstance, the common pheasant. Hence spangled breeds are often called\r\n\"pheasant\"-fowls. Another case of analogous variation in several domestic\r\nbreeds is inexplicable; it is, that the chickens, whilst covered with down,\r\nof the black Spanish, black Game, black Polish, and black Bantam, all have\r\nwhite throats and breasts, and often have some white on their wings.[391]\r\nThe editor of the 'Poultry Chronicle'[392] remarks that all the breeds\r\nwhich properly have red ear-lappets occasionally produce birds with white\r\near-lappets. This remark more especially applies to the Game breed, which\r\nof all comes nearest to the {245} _G. bankiva_; and we have seen that with\r\nthis species living in a state of nature, the ear-lappets vary in colour,\r\nbeing red in the Malayan countries, and generally, but not invariably,\r\nwhite in India.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn concluding this part of my subject I may repeat that there exists one\r\nwidely-ranging, varying, and common species of Gallus, namely _G. bankiva_,\r\nwhich can be tamed, produces fertile offspring when crossed with common\r\nfowls, and closely resembles in its whole structure, plumage, and voice the\r\nGame breed; hence it may be safely ranked as the parent of this, the most\r\ntypical domesticated breed. We have seen that there is much difficulty in\r\nbelieving that other, now unknown, species have been the parents of the\r\nother domestic breeds. We know that all the breeds are most closely allied,\r\nas shown by their similarity in most points of structure and in habits, and\r\nby the analogous manner in which they vary. We have also seen that several\r\nof the most distinct breeds occasionally or habitually closely resemble in\r\nplumage _G. bankiva_, and that the crossed offspring of other breeds, which\r\nare not thus coloured, show a stronger or weaker tendency to revert to this\r\nsame plumage. Some of the breeds, which appear the most distinct and the\r\nleast likely to have proceeded from _G. bankiva_, such as Polish fowls,\r\nwith their protuberant and little ossified skulls, and Cochins, with their\r\nimperfect tail and small wings, bear in these characters the plain marks of\r\ntheir artificial origin. We know well that of late years methodical\r\nselection has greatly improved and fixed many characters; and we have every\r\nreason to believe that unconscious selection, carried on for many\r\ngenerations, will have steadily augmented each new peculiarity and thus\r\nhave given rise to new breeds. As soon as two or three breeds had once been\r\nformed, crossing would come into play in changing their character and in\r\nincreasing their number. Brahma Pootras, according to an account lately\r\npublished in America, offer a good instance of a breed, lately formed by a\r\ncross, which can be truly propagated. The well-known Sebright Bantams offer\r\nanother and similar instance. Hence it may be concluded that not only the\r\nGame-breed but that all our breeds are probably the descendants of the\r\n{246} Malayan or Indian variety of _G. bankiva_. If so, this species has\r\nvaried greatly since it was first domesticated; but there has been ample\r\ntime, as we shall now show.\r\n\r\n_History of the Fowl._--Rütimeyer found no remains of the fowl in the\r\nancient Swiss lake-dwellings. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament; nor\r\nis it figured on the ancient Egyptian monuments.[393] It is not referred to\r\nby Homer or Hesiod (about 900 B.C.); but is mentioned by Theognis and\r\nAristophanes between 400 and 500 B.C. It is figured on some of the\r\nBabylonian cylinders, of which Mr. Layard sent me an impression, between\r\nthe sixth and seventh centuries B.C.; and on the Harpy Tomb in Lycia, about\r\n600 B.C.: so that we may feel pretty confident that the fowl reached Europe\r\nsomewhere near the sixth century B.C. It had travelled still farther\r\nwestward by the time of the Christian era, for it was found in Britain by\r\nJulius Cæsar. In India it must have been domesticated when the Institutes\r\nof Manu were written, that is, according to Sir W. Jones, 1200 B.C., but,\r\naccording to the later authority of Mr. H. Wilson, only 800 B.C., for the\r\ndomestic fowl is forbidden, whilst the wild is permitted to be eaten. If,\r\nas before remarked, we may trust the old Chinese Encyclopædia, the fowl\r\nmust have been domesticated several centuries earlier, as it is said to\r\nhave been introduced from the West into China 1400 B.C.\r\n\r\nSufficient materials do not exist for tracing the history of the separate\r\nbreeds. About the commencement of the Christian era, {247} Columella\r\nmentions a five-toed fighting breed, and some provincial breeds; but we\r\nknow nothing more about them. He also alludes to dwarf fowls; but these\r\ncannot have been the same with our Bantams, which, as Mr. Crawfurd has\r\nshown, were imported from Japan into Bantam in Java. A dwarf fowl, probably\r\nthe true Bantam, is referred to in an old Japanese Encyclopædia, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Birch. In the Chinese Encyclopædia published in 1596, but\r\ncompiled from various sources, some of high antiquity, seven breeds are\r\nmentioned, including what we should now call jumpers or creepers, and\r\nlikewise fowls with black feathers, bones, and flesh. In 1600 Aldrovandi\r\ndescribes seven or eight breeds of fowls, and this is the most ancient\r\nrecord from which the age of our European breeds can be inferred. The\r\n_Gallus Turcicus_ certainly seems to be a pencilled Hamburgh; but Mr.\r\nBrent, a most capable judge, thinks that Aldrovandi \"evidently figured what\r\nhe happened to see, and not the best of the breed.\" Mr. Brent, indeed,\r\nconsiders all Aldrovandi's fowls as of impure breed; but it is a far more\r\nprobable view that all our breeds since his time have been much improved\r\nand modified; for, as he went to the expense of so many figures, he\r\nprobably would have secured characteristic specimens. The Silk fowl,\r\nhowever, probably then existed in its present state, as did almost\r\ncertainly the fowl with frizzled or reversed feathers. Mr. Dixon[394]\r\nconsiders Aldrovandi's Paduan fowl as \"a variety of the Polish,\" whereas\r\nMr. Brent believes it to have been more nearly allied to the Malay. The\r\nanatomical peculiarities of the skull of the Polish breed were noticed by\r\nP. Borelli in 1656. I may add that in 1737 one Polish sub-breed, viz. the\r\ngolden spangled, was known; but judging from Albin's description, the comb\r\nwas then larger, the crest of feathers much smaller, the breast more\r\ncoarsely spotted, and the stomach and thighs much blacker: a\r\ngolden-spangled Polish fowl in this condition would now be of no value.\r\n\r\n_Differences in External and Internal Structure between the {248} Breeds:\r\nIndividual Variability._--Fowls have been exposed to diversified conditions\r\nof life, and as we have just seen there has been ample time for much\r\nvariability and for the slow action of unconscious selection. As there are\r\ngood grounds for believing that all the breeds are descended from _Gallus\r\nbankiva,_ it will be worth while to describe in some detail the chief\r\npoints of difference. Beginning with the eggs and chickens, I will pass on\r\nto the secondary sexual characters, and then to the differences in external\r\nstructure and in the skeleton. I enter on the following details chiefly to\r\nshow how variable almost every character has become under domestication.\r\n\r\n    _Eggs._--Mr. Dixon remarks[395] that \"to every hen belongs an\r\n    individual peculiarity in the form, colour, and size of her egg, which\r\n    never changes during her life-time, so long as she remains in health,\r\n    and which is as well known to those who are in the habit of taking her\r\n    produce, as the handwriting of their nearest acquaintance.\" I believe\r\n    that this is generally true, and that, if no great number of hens be\r\n    kept, the eggs of each can almost always be recognised. The eggs of\r\n    differently sized breeds naturally differ much in size; but,\r\n    apparently, not always in strict relation to the size of the hen: thus\r\n    the Malay is a larger bird than the Spanish, but _generally_ she\r\n    produces not such large eggs; white Bantams are said to lay smaller\r\n    eggs than other Bantams;[396] white Cochins, on the other hand, as I\r\n    hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, certainly lay larger eggs than buff Cochins.\r\n    The eggs, however, of the different breeds vary considerably in\r\n    character; for instance, Mr. Ballance states[397] that his Malay\r\n    \"pullets of last year laid eggs equal in size to those of any duck, and\r\n    other Malay hens, two or three years old, laid eggs very little larger\r\n    than a good-sized Bantam's egg. Some were as white as a Spanish hen's\r\n    egg, and others varied from a light cream-colour to a deep rich buff,\r\n    or even to a brown.\" The shape also varies, the two ends being much\r\n    more equally rounded in Cochins than in Games or Polish. Spanish fowls\r\n    lay smoother eggs than Cochins, of which the eggs are generally\r\n    granulated. The shell in this latter breed, and more especially in\r\n    Malays, is apt to be thicker than in Games or Spanish; but the\r\n    Minorcas, a sub-breed of Spanish, are said to lay harder eggs than true\r\n    Spanish.[398] The colour differs considerably,--the Cochins laying\r\n    buff-coloured eggs; the Malays {249} a paler variable buff; and Games a\r\n    still paler buff. It would appear that darker-coloured eggs\r\n    characterise the breeds which have lately come from the East, or are\r\n    still closely allied to those now living there. The colour of the yolk,\r\n    according to Ferguson, as well as of the shell, differs slightly in the\r\n    sub-breeds of the Game, and stands in some degree of correlation with\r\n    the colour of the plumage. I am also informed by Mr. Brent that dark\r\n    partridge-coloured Cochin hens lay darker coloured eggs than the other\r\n    Cochin sub-breeds. The flavour and richness of the egg certainly differ\r\n    in different breeds. The productiveness of the several breeds is very\r\n    different. Spanish, Polish, and Hamburgh hens have lost the incubating\r\n    instinct.\r\n\r\n    _Chickens._--As the young of almost all gallinaceous birds, even of the\r\n    black curassow and black grouse, whilst covered with down, are\r\n    longitudinally striped on the back,--of which character, when adult,\r\n    neither sex retains a trace,--it might have been expected that the\r\n    chickens of all our domestic fowls would have been similarly\r\n    striped.[399] This could, however, hardly have been expected, when the\r\n    adult plumage in both sexes has undergone so great a change as to be\r\n    wholly white or black. In white fowls of various breeds the chickens\r\n    are uniformly yellowish white, passing in the black-boned Silk fowl\r\n    into bright canary-yellow. This is also generally the case with the\r\n    chickens of white Cochins, but I hear from Mr. Zurhost that they are\r\n    sometimes of a buff or oak colour, and that all those of this latter\r\n    colour, which were watched, turned out males. The chickens of buff\r\n    Cochins are of a golden-yellow, easily distinguishable from the paler\r\n    tint of the white Cochins, and are often longitudinally streaked with\r\n    dark shades: the chickens of silver-cinnamon Cochins are almost always\r\n    of a buff colour. The chickens of the white Game and white Dorking\r\n    breeds, when held in particular lights, sometimes exhibit (on the\r\n    authority of Mr. Brent) faint traces of longitudinal stripes. Fowls\r\n    which are entirely black, namely Spanish, black Game, black Polish, and\r\n    black Bantams, display a new character, for their chickens have their\r\n    breasts and throats more or less white, with sometimes a little white\r\n    elsewhere. Spanish chickens also, occasionally (Brent), have, where the\r\n    down was white, their first true feathers tipped for a time with white.\r\n    The primordially striped character is retained by the chickens of most\r\n    of the Game sub-breeds (Brent, Dixon); by Dorkings; by the partridge\r\n    and grouse-coloured sub-breeds of Cochins (Brent), but not, as we have\r\n    seen, by all the other sub-breeds; by the pheasant-Malay (Dixon), but\r\n    apparently not (at which I am much surprised) by other Malays. The\r\n    following breeds and sub-breeds are barely, or not at all,\r\n    longitudinally striped; viz. gold and silver pencilled Hamburghs, which\r\n    can hardly be distinguished from each other (Brent) in the down, both\r\n    having a few {250} dark spots on the head and rump, with occasionally a\r\n    longitudinal stripe (Dixon) on the back of the neck. I have seen only\r\n    one chicken of the silver-spangled Hamburgh, and this was obscurely\r\n    striped along the back. Gold-spangled Polish chickens (Tegetmeier) are\r\n    of a warm russet brown; and silver-spangled Polish chickens are grey,\r\n    sometimes (Dixon) with dashes of ochre on the head, wings, and breast.\r\n    Cuckoo and blue-dun fowls (Dixon) are grey in the down. The chickens of\r\n    Sebright Bantams (Dixon) are uniformly dark brown, whilst those of the\r\n    brown-breasted red Game Bantam are black, with some white on the throat\r\n    and breast. From these facts we see that the chickens of the different\r\n    breeds, and even of the same main breed, differ much in their downy\r\n    plumage; and, although longitudinal stripes characterise the young of\r\n    all wild gallinaceous birds, they disappear in several domestic breeds.\r\n    Perhaps it may be accepted as a general rule that the more the adult\r\n    plumage differs from that of the adult _G. bankiva,_ the more\r\n    completely the chickens have lost their proper stripes.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the period of life at which the characters proper to each\r\nbreed first appear, it is obvious that such structures as additional toes\r\nmust be formed long before birth. In Polish fowls, the extraordinary\r\nprotuberance of the anterior part of the skull is well developed before the\r\nchickens come out of the egg;[400] but the crest, which is supported on the\r\nprotuberance, is at first feebly developed, nor does it attain its full\r\nsize until the second year. The Spanish cock is pre-eminent for his\r\nmagnificent comb, and this is developed at an unusually early age; so that\r\nthe young males can be distinguished from the females when only a few weeks\r\nold, and therefore earlier than in other breeds; they likewise crow very\r\nearly, namely, when about six weeks old. In the Dutch sub-breed of the\r\nSpanish fowl the white ear-lappets are developed earlier than in the common\r\nSpanish breed.[401] Cochins are characterised by a small tail, and in the\r\nyoung cocks the tail is developed at an unusually late period.[402] Game\r\nfowls are notorious for their pugnacity; and the young cocks crow, clap\r\ntheir little wings, and obstinately fight with each other, even whilst\r\nunder their mother's care.[403] \"I have often had,\" says one {251}\r\nauthor,[404] \"whole broods, scarcely feathered, stone-blind from fighting;\r\nthe rival couples moping in corners, and renewing their battles on\r\nobtaining the first ray of light.\" With the males of all gallinaceous birds\r\nthe use of their weapons and pugnacity is to fight for the possession of\r\nthe females; so that the tendency in our Game chickens to fight at an\r\nextremely early age is not only useless, but is injurious, as they suffer\r\nso much from their wounds. The training for battle during an early period\r\nmay be natural to the wild _Gallus bankiva_; but as man during many\r\ngenerations has gone on selecting the most obstinately pugnacious cocks, it\r\nis more probable that their pugnacity has been unnaturally increased, and\r\nunnaturally transferred to the young male chickens. In the same manner, it\r\nis probable that the extraordinary development of the comb in the Spanish\r\ncock has been unintentionally transferred to the young cocks; for fanciers\r\nwould not care whether their young birds had large combs, but would select\r\nfor breeding the adults which had the finest combs, whether or not\r\ndeveloped at an early period. The last point which need here be noticed is\r\nthat, though the chickens of Spanish and Malay fowls are well covered with\r\ndown, the true feathers are acquired at an unusually late age; so that for\r\na time the young birds are partially naked, and are liable to suffer from\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n_Secondary Sexual Characters._--The two sexes in the parent-form, the\r\n_Gallus bankiva_, differ much in colour. In our domestic breeds the\r\ndifference is never greater, but is often less, and varies much in degree\r\neven in the sub-breeds of the same main breed. Thus in certain Game fowls\r\nthe difference is as great as in the parent-form, whilst in the black and\r\nwhite sub-breeds there is no difference in plumage. Mr. Brent informs me\r\nthat he has seen two strains of black-breasted red Games, in which the\r\ncocks could not be distinguished, whilst the hens in one were\r\npartridge-brown and in the other fawn-brown. A similar case has been\r\nobserved in the strains of the brown-breasted red Game. The hen of the\r\n\"duck-winged Game\" is \"extremely beautiful,\" and differs much from the hens\r\nof all the other Game sub-breeds; but generally, as with the blue and grey\r\nGame and {252} with some sub-varieties of the pile-game, a moderately close\r\nrelation may be observed between the males and females in the variation of\r\ntheir plumage.[405] A similar relation is also evident when we compare the\r\nseveral varieties of Cochins. In the two sexes of gold and silver-spangled\r\nand of buff Polish fowls, there is much general similarity in the colouring\r\nand marks of the whole plumage, excepting of course in the hackles, crest,\r\nand beard. In spangled Hamburghs, there is likewise a considerable degree\r\nof similarity between the two sexes. In pencilled Hamburghs, on the other\r\nhand, there is much dissimilarity; the pencilling which is characteristic\r\nof the hens being almost absent in the males of both the golden and silver\r\nvarieties. But, as we have already seen, it cannot be given as a general\r\nrule that male fowls never have pencilled feathers, for Cuckoo Dorkings are\r\n\"remarkable from having nearly similar markings in both sexes.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that the males in certain sub-breeds have lost some\r\nof their secondary masculine characters, and, from their close resemblance\r\nin plumage to the females, are often called hennies. There is much\r\ndiversity of opinion whether these males are in any degree sterile; that\r\nthey sometimes are partially sterile seems clear,[406] but this may have\r\nbeen caused by too close interbreeding. That they are not quite sterile,\r\nand that the whole case is widely different from that of old females\r\nassuming masculine characters, is evident from several of these hen-like\r\nsub-breeds having been long propagated. The males and females of gold and\r\nsilver-laced Sebright Bantams can be barely distinguished from each other,\r\nexcept by their combs, wattles, and spurs, for they are coloured alike, and\r\nthe males have not hackles, nor the flowing sickle-like tail-feathers. A\r\nhen-tailed sub-breed of Hamburghs was recently much esteemed. There is also\r\na breed of Game-fowls, in which the males and females resemble each other\r\nso closely that the cocks have often mistaken their hen-feathered opponents\r\nin the cock-pit for real hens, and by the mistake have lost their\r\nlives.[407] The cocks, {253} though dressed in the feathers of the hen,\r\n\"are high-spirited birds, and their courage has been often proved:\" an\r\nengraving even has been published of one celebrated hen-tailed victor. Mr.\r\nTegetmeier[408] has recorded the remarkable case of a brown-breasted red\r\nGame-cock which, after assuming its perfect masculine plumage, became\r\nhen-feathered in the autumn of the following year; but he did not lose\r\nvoice, spurs, strength, nor productiveness. This bird has now retained the\r\nsame character during five seasons, and has begot both hen-feathered and\r\nmale-feathered offspring. Mr. Grantley F. Berkeley relates the still more\r\nsingular case of a celebrated strain of \"polecat Game-fowls,\" which\r\nproduced in nearly every brood a single hen-cock. \"The great peculiarity in\r\none of these birds was that he, as the seasons succeeded each other, was\r\nnot always a hen-cock, and not always of the colour called the polecat,\r\nwhich is black. From the polecat and hen-cock feather in one season he\r\nmoulted to a full male-plumaged black-breasted red, and in the following\r\nyear he returned to the former feather.\"[409]\r\n\r\nI have remarked in my 'Origin of Species' that secondary sexual characters\r\nare apt to differ much in the species of the same genus, and to be\r\nunusually variable in the individuals of the same species. So it is with\r\nthe breeds of the fowl, as we have already seen, as far as the colour of\r\nplumage is concerned, and so it is with the other secondary sexual\r\ncharacters. Firstly, the comb differs much in the various breeds,[410] and\r\nits form is eminently characteristic of each kind, with the exception of\r\nthe Dorkings, in which the form has not been as yet determined on by\r\nfanciers, and fixed by selection. A single, deeply-serrated comb is the\r\ntypical and most common form. It differs much in size, being immensely\r\ndeveloped in Spanish fowls; and in a local breed called Red-caps, it is\r\nsometimes \"upwards of three inches in breadth at the front, and more than\r\nfour inches in length, measured to the end of the peak behind.\"[411] In\r\nsome breeds the comb is double, and when the two ends are cemented {254}\r\ntogether it forms a \"cup-comb;\" in the \"rose-comb\" it is depressed, covered\r\nwith small projections, and produced backwards; in the horned and\r\ncrève-coeur fowl it is produced into two horns; it is triple in the\r\npea-combed Brahmas, short and truncated in the Malays, and absent in the\r\nGuelderlands. In the tasselled Game a few long feathers arise from the back\r\nof the comb; in many breeds a crest of feathers replaces the comb. The\r\ncrest, when little developed, arises from a fleshy mass, but, when much\r\ndeveloped, from a hemispherical protuberance of the skull. In the best\r\nPolish fowls it is so largely developed, that I have seen birds which could\r\nhardly pick up their food; and a German writer asserts[412] that they are\r\nin consequence liable to be struck by hawks. Monstrous structures of this\r\nkind would thus be suppressed in a state of nature. The wattles, also, vary\r\nmuch in size, being small in Malays and some other breeds; they are\r\nreplaced in certain Polish sub-breeds by a great tuft of feathers called a\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nThe hackles do not differ much in the various breeds, but are short and\r\nstiff in Malays, and absent in Hennies. As in some orders of birds the\r\nmales display extraordinarily-shaped feathers, such as naked shafts with\r\ndiscs at the end, &c., the following case may be worth giving. In the wild\r\n_Gallus bankiva_ and in our domestic fowls, the barbs which arise from each\r\nside of the extremities of the hackles are naked or not clothed with\r\nbarbules, so that they resemble bristles; but Mr. Brent sent me some\r\nscapular hackles from a young Birchen Duckwing Game cock, in which the\r\nnaked barbs became densely reclothed with barbules towards their tips; so\r\nthat these tips, which were dark coloured with a metallic lustre, were\r\nseparated from the lower parts by a symmetrically-shaped transparent zone\r\nformed of the naked portions of the barbs. Hence the coloured tips appeared\r\nlike little separate metallic discs.\r\n\r\nThe sickle-feathers in the tail, of which there are three pair, and which\r\nare eminently characteristic of the male sex, differ much in the various\r\nbreeds. They are scimitar-shaped in some Hamburghs, instead of being long\r\nand flowing as in the typical breeds. They are extremely short in Cochins,\r\nand are not at {255} all developed in Hennies. They are carried, together\r\nwith the whole tail, erect in Dorkings and Games; but droop much in Malays\r\nand in some Cochins. Sultans are characterized by an additional number of\r\nlateral sickle-feathers. The spurs vary much, being placed higher or lower\r\non the shank; being extremely long and sharp in Games, and blunt and short\r\nin Cochins. These latter birds seem aware that their spurs are not\r\nefficient weapons; for though they occasionally use them, they more\r\nfrequently fight, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, by seizing and\r\nshaking each other with their beaks. In some Indian Game-cocks, received by\r\nMr. Brent from Germany, there are, as he informs me, three, four, or even\r\nfive spurs on each leg. Some Dorkings also have two spurs on each leg;[413]\r\nand in birds of this breed the spur is often placed almost on the outside\r\nof the leg. Double spurs are mentioned in the ancient Chinese Encyclopædia.\r\nTheir occurrence may be considered as a case of analogous variation, for\r\nsome wild gallinaceous birds, for instance, the Polyplectron, have double\r\nspurs.\r\n\r\nJudging from the differences which generally distinguish the sexes in the\r\nGallinaceæ, certain characters in our domestic fowls appear to have been\r\ntransferred from the one sex to the other. In all the species (except in\r\nTurnix), when there is any conspicuous difference in plumage between the\r\nmale and female, the male is always the most beautiful; but in\r\ngolden-spangled Hamburghs the hen is equally beautiful with the cock, and\r\nincomparably more beautiful than the hen in any natural species of Gallus;\r\nso that here a masculine character has been transferred to the female. On\r\nthe other hand, in cuckoo Dorkings and in other cuckoo breeds the\r\npencilling, which in Gallus is a female attribute, has been transferred to\r\nthe male: nor, on the principle of analogous variation, is this\r\ntransference surprising, as the males in many gallinaceous genera are\r\nbarred or pencilled. With most of these birds head ornaments of all kinds\r\nare more fully developed in the male than in the female; but in Polish\r\nfowls the crest or top-knot, which in the male replaces the comb, is\r\nequally developed in both sexes. In certain {256} sub-breeds, which, from\r\nthe hen having a small crest, are called lark-crested, \"a single upright\r\ncomb sometimes almost entirely takes the place of the crest in the\r\nmale.\"[414] From this latter case, and from some facts presently to be\r\ngiven with respect to the protuberance of the skull in Polish fowls, the\r\ncrest in this breed ought perhaps to be viewed as a feminine character\r\nwhich has been transferred to the male. In the Spanish breed the male, as\r\nwe know, has an immense comb, and this has been partially transferred to\r\nthe female, for her comb is unusually large, though not upright. In\r\nGame-fowls the bold and savage disposition of the male has likewise been\r\nlargely transferred to the female;[415] and she sometimes even possesses\r\nthe eminently masculine character of spurs. Many cases are on record of\r\nhens being furnished with spurs; and in Germany, according to\r\nBechstein,[416] the spurs in the Silk-hen are sometimes very long. He\r\nmentions also another breed similarly characterized, in which the hens are\r\nexcellent layers, but are apt to disturb and break their eggs owing to\r\ntheir spurs.\r\n\r\nMr. Layard[417] has given an account of a breed of fowls in Ceylon with\r\nblack skin, bones, and wattle, but with ordinary feathers, and which cannot\r\n\"be more aptly described than by comparing them to a white fowl drawn down\r\na sooty chimney; it is, however,\" adds Mr. Layard, \"a remarkable fact that\r\na male bird of the pure sooty variety is almost as rare as a tortoise-shell\r\ntom-cat.\" Mr. Blyth finds that the same rule holds good with this breed\r\nnear Calcutta. The males and females, on the other hand, of the black-boned\r\nEuropean breed, with silky feathers, do not differ from each other; so that\r\nin the one breed black skin and bones, and the same kind of plumage, are\r\ncommon to both sexes, whilst in the other breed these characters are\r\nconfined to the female sex.\r\n\r\nAt the present day all the breeds of Polish fowls have the great bony\r\nprotuberance on their skulls, which includes part of the brain and supports\r\nthe crest, equally developed in both sexes. {257} But formerly in Germany\r\nthe skull of the hen alone was protuberant: Blumenbach,[418] who\r\nparticularly attended to abnormal peculiarities in domestic animals,\r\nstates, in 1813, that this was the case; and Bechstein had previously, in\r\n1793, observed the same fact. This latter author has carefully described\r\nthe effects of a crest on the skull not only in fowls, but in ducks, geese,\r\nand canaries. He states that with fowls, when the crest is not much\r\ndeveloped, it is supported on a fatty mass; but when much developed, it is\r\nalways supported on a bony protuberance of variable size. He well describes\r\nthe peculiarities of this protuberance, and he attended to the effects of\r\nthe modified shape of the brain on the intellect of these birds, and\r\ndisputes Pallas' statement that they are stupid. He then expressly states\r\nthat he never observed this protuberance in male fowls. Hence there can be\r\nno doubt that this remarkable character in the skulls of Polish fowls was\r\nformerly in Germany confined to the female sex, but has now been\r\ntransferred to the males, and has thus become common to both sexes.\r\n\r\n_External Differences, not connected with the sexes, between the breeds and\r\nbetween individual birds._\r\n\r\n    The size of the body differs greatly. Mr. Tegetmeier has known a Brahma\r\n    to weigh 17 pounds; a fine Malay cock 10 pounds; whilst a first-rate\r\n    Sebright Bantam weighs hardly more than 1 pound. During the last 20\r\n    years the size of some of our breeds has been largely increased by\r\n    methodical selection, whilst that of other breeds has been much\r\n    diminished. We have already seen how greatly colour varies even within\r\n    the same breed; we know that the wild _G. bankiva_ varies slightly in\r\n    colour; we know that colour is variable in all our domestic animals;\r\n    nevertheless some eminent fanciers have so little faith in variability,\r\n    that they have actually argued that the chief Game sub-breeds, which\r\n    differ from each other in nothing but colour, are descended from\r\n    distinct wild species! Crossing often causes strange modifications of\r\n    colour. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that when buff and white Cochins are\r\n    crossed, some of the {258} chickens are almost invariably black.\r\n    According to Mr. Brent, black and white Cochins occasionally produce\r\n    chickens of a slaty-blue tint; and this same tint appears, as Mr.\r\n    Tegetmeier tells me, from crossing white Cochins with black Spanish\r\n    fowls, or white Dorkings with black Minorcas.[419] A good observer[420]\r\n    states that a first-rate silver-spangled Hamburgh hen gradually lost\r\n    the most characteristic qualities of the breed, for the black lacing to\r\n    her feathers disappeared, and her legs changed from leaden-blue to\r\n    white; but what makes the case remarkable is, that this tendency ran in\r\n    the blood, for her sister changed in a similar but less strongly marked\r\n    manner; and chickens produced from this latter hen were at first almost\r\n    pure white, \"but on moulting acquired black collars and some spangled\r\n    feathers with almost obliterated markings;\" so that a new variety arose\r\n    in this singular manner. The skin in the different breeds differs much\r\n    in colour, being white in common kinds, yellow in Malays and Cochins,\r\n    and black in Silk fowls; thus mocking, as M. Godron[421] remarks, the\r\n    three principal types of skin in mankind. The same author adds, that,\r\n    as different kinds of fowls living in distant and isolated parts of the\r\n    world have black skin and bones, this colour must have appeared at\r\n    various times and places.\r\n\r\n    The shape and carriage of the body and the shape of the head differ\r\n    much. The beak varies slightly in length and curvature, but\r\n    incomparably less than with pigeons. In most crested fowls the nostrils\r\n    offer a remarkable peculiarity in being raised with a crescentic\r\n    outline. The primary wing-feathers are short in Cochins; in a male,\r\n    which must have been more than twice as heavy as _G. bankiva_, these\r\n    feathers were in both birds of the same length. I have counted, with\r\n    Mr. Tegetmeier's aid, the primary wing-feathers in thirteen cocks and\r\n    hens of various breeds; in four of them, namely in two Hamburghs, a\r\n    Cochin, and Game Bantam, there were 10, instead of the normal number 9;\r\n    but in counting these feathers I have followed the practice of\r\n    fanciers, and have _not_ included the first minute primary feather,\r\n    barely three-quarters of an inch in length. These feathers differ\r\n    considerably in relative length, the fourth, or the fifth, or the\r\n    sixth, being the longest; with the third either equal to, or\r\n    considerably shorter than the fifth. In wild gallinaceous species the\r\n    relative length and number of the main wing and tail-feathers are\r\n    extremely constant.\r\n\r\n    The tail differs much in erectness and size, being small in Malays and\r\n    very small in Cochins. In thirteen fowls of various breeds which I have\r\n    examined, five had the normal number of 14 feathers, including in this\r\n    number the two middle sickle-feathers; six others (viz. a Caffre cock,\r\n    Gold-spangled Polish cock, Cochin hen, Sultan hen, Game hen, and Malay\r\n    hen) had 16; {259} and two (an old Cochin cock and Malay hen) had 17\r\n    feathers. The rumpless fowl has no tail, and in a bird which I kept\r\n    alive the oil-gland had aborted; but this bird, though the os coccygis\r\n    was extremely imperfect, had a vestige of a tail with two rather long\r\n    feathers in the position of the outer caudals. This bird came from a\r\n    family where, as I was told, the breed had kept true for twenty years;\r\n    but rumpless fowls often produce chickens with tails.[422] An eminent\r\n    physiologist[423] has recently spoken of this breed as a distinct\r\n    species; had he examined the deformed state of the os coccyx he would\r\n    never have come to this conclusion; he was probably misled by the\r\n    statement, which may be found in some works, that tailless fowls are\r\n    wild in Ceylon; but this statement, as I have been assured by Mr.\r\n    Layard and Dr. Kellaert, who have so closely studied the birds of\r\n    Ceylon, is utterly false.\r\n\r\n    The tarsi vary considerably in length, being relatively to the femur\r\n    considerably longer in the Spanish and Frizzled, and shorter in the\r\n    Silk and Bantam breeds, than in the wild _G. bankiva_; but in the\r\n    latter, as we have seen, the tarsi vary in length. The tarsi are often\r\n    feathered. The feet in many breeds are furnished with additional toes.\r\n    Golden-spangled Polish fowls are said[424] to have the skin between\r\n    their toes much developed; Mr. Tegetmeier observed this in one bird,\r\n    but it was not so in one which I examined. In Cochins the middle toe is\r\n    said[425] to be nearly double the length of the lateral toes, and\r\n    therefore much longer than in _G. bankiva_ or in other fowls; but this\r\n    was not the case in two which I examined. The nail of the middle toe in\r\n    this same breed is surprisingly broad and flat, but in a variable\r\n    degree in two birds which I examined; of this structure in the nail\r\n    there is only a trace in _G. bankiva_.\r\n\r\n    The voice differs slightly, as I am informed by Mr. Dixon, in almost\r\n    every breed. The Malays[426] have a loud, deep, somewhat prolonged\r\n    crow, but with considerable individual differences. Colonel Sykes\r\n    remarks that the domestic Kulm cock in India has not the shrill clear\r\n    pipe of the English bird, and \"his scale of notes appears more\r\n    limited.\" Dr. Hooker was struck with the \"prolonged howling screech\" of\r\n    the cocks in Sikhim.[427] The crow of the Cochin is notoriously and\r\n    ludicrously different from that of the common cock. The disposition of\r\n    the different breeds is widely different, varying from the savage and\r\n    defiant temper of the Game-cock to the extremely peaceable temper of\r\n    the Cochin. The latter, it has been asserted, \"graze to a much greater\r\n    extent than any other varieties.\" The Spanish fowls suffer more from\r\n    frost than other breeds.\r\n\r\nBefore we pass on to the skeleton, the degree of distinctness of the\r\nseveral breeds from _G. bankiva_ ought to be noticed. Some {260} writers\r\nspeak of the Spanish as one of the most distinct breeds, and so it is in\r\ngeneral aspect; but its characteristic differences are not important. The\r\nMalay appears to me more distinct, from its tall stature, small drooping\r\ntail with more than fourteen tail-feathers, and from its small comb and\r\nwattles; nevertheless one Malay sub-breed is coloured almost exactly like\r\n_G. bankiva._ Some authors consider the Polish fowl as very distinct; but\r\nthis is a semi-monstrous breed, as shown by the protuberant and irregularly\r\nperforated skull. The Cochin, with its deeply furrowed frontal bones,\r\npeculiarly shaped occipital foramen, short wing-feathers, short tail\r\ncontaining more than fourteen feathers, broad nail to the middle toe,\r\nfluffy plumage, rough and dark-coloured eggs, and especially from its\r\npeculiar voice, is probably the most distinct of all the breeds. If any one\r\nof our breeds has descended from some unknown species, distinct from _G.\r\nbankiva,_ it is probably the Cochin; but the balance of evidence does not\r\nfavour this view. All the characteristic differences of the Cochin breed\r\nare more or less variable, and may be detected in a greater or lesser\r\ndegree in other breeds. One sub-breed is coloured closely like _G.\r\nbankiva._ The feathered legs, often furnished with an additional toe, the\r\nwings incapable of flight, the extremely quiet disposition, indicate a long\r\ncourse of domestication; and these fowls come from China, where we know\r\nthat plants and animals have been tended from a remote period with\r\nextraordinary care, and where consequently we might expect to find\r\nprofoundly modified domestic races.\r\n\r\n_Osteological Differences._--I have examined twenty-seven skeletons and\r\nfifty-three skulls of various breeds, including three of _G. bankiva_:\r\nnearly half of these skulls I owe to the kindness of Mr. Tegetmeier, and\r\nthree of the skeletons to Mr. Eyton.\r\n\r\n    The _Skull_ differs greatly in size in different breeds, being nearly\r\n    twice as long in the largest Cochins, but not nearly twice as broad, as\r\n    in Bantams. The bones at the base, from the occipital foramen to the\r\n    anterior end (including the quadrates and pterygoids), are absolutely\r\n    identical in _shape_ in all the skulls. So is the lower jaw. In the\r\n    forehead slight differences are often perceptible between the males and\r\n    females, evidently caused by the presence of the comb. In every case I\r\n    take the skull of _G. bankiva_ as the standard of comparison. In four\r\n    Games, in one Malay hen, in an {261} African cock, in a Frizzled cock\r\n    from Madras, in two black-boned Silk hens, no differences occur worth\r\n    notice. In three _Spanish_ cocks, the form of the forehead between the\r\n    orbits differs considerably; in one it is considerably depressed,\r\n    whilst in the two others it is rather prominent, with a deep medial\r\n    furrow; the skull of the hen is smooth. In three skulls of _Sebright\r\n    Bantams_ the crown is more globular, and slopes more abruptly to the\r\n    occiput, than in _G. bankiva_. In a Bantam or Jumper from Burmah these\r\n    same characters are more strongly pronounced, and the supra-occiput is\r\n    more pointed. In a black Bantam the skull is not so globular, and the\r\n    occipital foramen is very large, and has nearly the same sub-triangular\r\n    outline presently to be described in Cochins; and in this skull the two\r\n    ascending branches of the premaxillary are overlapped in a singular\r\n    manner by the processes of the nasal bone, but, as I have seen only one\r\n    specimen, some of these differences may be individual. Of Cochins and\r\n    Brahmas (the latter a crossed race approaching closely to Cochins) I\r\n    have examined seven skulls; at the point where the ascending branches\r\n    of the premaxillary rest on the frontal bone the surface is much\r\n    depressed, and from this depression a deep medial furrow extends\r\n    backwards to a variable distance; the edges of this fissure are rather\r\n    prominent, as is the top of the skull behind and over the orbits. These\r\n    characters are less developed in the hens. The pterygoids, and the\r\n    processes of the lower jaw, relatively to the size of the head, are\r\n    broader than in _G. bankiva_; and this is likewise the case with\r\n    Dorkings when of large size. The terminal fork of the hyoid bone in\r\n    Cochins is twice as wide as in _G. bankiva_, whereas the length of the\r\n    other hyoid bones is only as three to two. But the most remarkable\r\n    character is the shape of the occipital foramen: in _G. bankiva_ (A)\r\n    the breadth in a horizontal line exceeds the height in a vertical line,\r\n    and the outline is nearly circular; whereas in Cochins (B) the outline\r\n    is sub-triangular, and the vertical line exceeds the horizontal line in\r\n    length. This same form likewise occurs in the black Bantam above\r\n    referred to, and an approach to it may be seen in some Dorkings, and in\r\n    a slight degree in certain other breeds.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Occipital Foramen, of natural size. A. Wild\r\n    _Gallus bankiva_. B. Cochin Cock.]\r\n\r\n    Of _Dorkings_ I have examined three skulls, one belonging to the white\r\n    sub-breed; the one character deserving notice is the breadth of the\r\n    frontal bones, which are moderately furrowed in the middle; thus in a\r\n    skull which was less than once and a half the length of that of _G.\r\n    bankiva_, the breadth between the orbits was exactly double. Of\r\n    _Hamburghs_ I have examined four skulls (male and female) of the\r\n    pencilled sub-breed, and one (male) of the spangled sub-breed; the\r\n    nasal bones stand remarkably wide apart, but in a variable degree;\r\n    consequently narrow membrane-covered spaces fare left between the tips\r\n    of the two ascending branches of the premaxillary {262} bones, which\r\n    are rather short, and between these branches and the nasal bones. The\r\n    surface of the frontal bone, on which the branches of the premaxillary\r\n    rest, is very little depressed. These peculiarities no doubt stand in\r\n    close relation with the broad flattened rose-comb characteristic of the\r\n    Hamburgh breed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 34.--Skulls of natural size, viewed from above, a\r\n    little obliquely. A. Wild _Gallus bankiva_. B. White-crested Polish\r\n    Cock.]\r\n\r\n    I have examined fourteen skulls of _Polish and other crested breeds_.\r\n    Their differences are extraordinary. First for nine skulls of different\r\n    sub-breeds of English Polish fowls. The hemispherical protuberance of\r\n    the frontal bones[428] may be seen in the accompanying drawings, in\r\n    which (B) the skull of a white-crested Polish fowl is shown obliquely\r\n    from above, with the skull (A) of _G. bankiva_ in the same position. In\r\n    fig. 35 longitudinal sections are given of the skulls of a Polish fowl,\r\n    and, for comparison, of a Cochin of the same size. The protuberance in\r\n    all Polish fowls occupies the same position, but differs much in size.\r\n    In one of my nine specimens it was extremely slight. The degree to\r\n    which the protuberance is ossified varies greatly, larger or smaller\r\n    portions of bone being replaced by membrane. In one specimen there was\r\n    only a single open pore; generally, there are many variously-shaped\r\n    open spaces, the bone forming an irregular reticulation. A medial,\r\n    longitudinal, arched ribbon of bone is generally retained, but in one\r\n    specimen there was no bone whatever over the whole protuberance, and\r\n    the skull when cleaned and viewed from above presented the appearance\r\n    of an open basin. The change in the whole internal form of the skull is\r\n    surprisingly great. The brain is modified in a corresponding manner, as\r\n    is shown in the two longitudinal sections, {263} which deserve\r\n    attentive consideration. The upper and anterior cavity of the three\r\n    into which the skull may be divided, is the one which is so greatly\r\n    modified; it is evidently much larger than in the Cochin skull of the\r\n    same size, and extends much further beyond the interorbital septum, but\r\n    laterally is less deep. Whether this cavity is entirely filled by the\r\n    brain, may be doubted. In the skull of the Cochin and of all ordinary\r\n    fowls a strong internal ridge of bone separates the anterior from the\r\n    central cavity; but this ridge is entirely absent in the Polish skull\r\n    here figured. The shape of the central cavity is circular in the\r\n    Polish, and lengthened in the Cochin skull. The shape of the posterior\r\n    cavity, together with the position, size, and number of the pores for\r\n    the nerves, differ much in these two skulls. A pit deeply penetrating\r\n    the occipital bone of the Cochin is entirely absent in this Polish\r\n    skull, whilst in another specimen it was well developed. In this second\r\n    specimen the whole internal surface of the posterior cavity likewise\r\n    differs to a certain extent in shape. I made sections of two other\r\n    skulls,--namely, of a Polish fowl with the protuberance singularly\r\n    little developed, and of a Sultan in which it was a little more\r\n    developed; and when these two skulls were placed between the two above\r\n    figured (fig. 35), a perfect gradation in the configuration of each\r\n    part of the internal surface could be traced. In the Polish skull, with\r\n    a small protuberance, the ridge between the anterior and middle\r\n    cavities was present, but low; and in the Sultan this ridge was\r\n    replaced by a narrow furrow standing on a broad raised eminence.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 35.--Longitudinal sections of Skull, of natural\r\n    size, viewed laterally. A. Polish Cock. B. Cochin Cock, selected for\r\n    comparison with the above from being of nearly the same size.]\r\n\r\n    {264}\r\n\r\n    It may naturally be asked whether these remarkable modifications in the\r\n    form of the brain affect the intellect of Polish fowls; some writers\r\n    have stated that they are extremely stupid, but Bechstein and Mr.\r\n    Tegetmeier have shown that this is by no means generally the case.\r\n    Nevertheless Bechstein[429] states that he had a Polish hen which \"was\r\n    crazy, and anxiously wandered about all day long.\" A hen in my\r\n    possession was solitary in her habits, and was often so absorbed in\r\n    reverie that she could be touched; she was also deficient in the most\r\n    singular manner in the faculty of finding her way, so that, if she\r\n    strayed a hundred yards from her feeding-place, she was completely\r\n    lost, and would then obstinately try to proceed in a wrong direction. I\r\n    have received other and similar accounts of Polish fowls appearing\r\n    stupid or half-idiotic.[430]\r\n\r\n    To return to the skull. The posterior part, viewed externally, differs\r\n    little from that of _G. bankiva_. In most fowls the posterior-lateral\r\n    process of the frontal bone and the process of the squamosal bone run\r\n    together and are ossified near their extremities: this union of the two\r\n    bones, however, is not constant in any breed; and in eleven out of\r\n    fourteen skulls of crested breeds, these processes were quite distinct.\r\n    These processes, when not united, instead of being inclined anteriorly\r\n    as in all common breeds, descend at right angles to the lower jaw; and\r\n    in this case the longer axis of the bony cavity of the ear is likewise\r\n    more perpendicular than in other breeds. When the squamosal process is\r\n    free, instead of expanding at the tip, it is reduced to an extremely\r\n    fine and pointed style, of variable length. The pterygoid and quadrate\r\n    bones present no difference. The palatine bones are a little more\r\n    curved upwards at their posterior ends. The frontal bones, anteriorly\r\n    to the protuberance, are, as in Dorkings, very broad, but in a variable\r\n    degree. The nasal bones either stand far apart, as in Hamburghs, or\r\n    almost touch each other, and in one instance were ossified together.\r\n    Each nasal bone properly sends out in front two long processes of equal\r\n    lengths, forming a fork; but in all the Polish skulls, except one, the\r\n    inner process was considerably, but in a variable degree, shortened and\r\n    somewhat upturned. In all the skulls, except one, the two ascending\r\n    branches of the premaxillary, instead of running up between the\r\n    processes of the nasal bones and resting on the ethmoid bone, are much\r\n    shortened and terminate in a blunt, somewhat upturned point. In those\r\n    skulls in which the nasal bones approach quite close to each other or\r\n    are ossified together, it would be impossible for the ascending\r\n    branches of the premaxillary to reach the ethmoid and frontal bones;\r\n    hence we see that even the relative connection of the bones has been\r\n    changed. Apparently in consequence of the branches of the premaxillary\r\n    and of the inner processes of the nasal bones being somewhat upturned,\r\n    the external orifices of the nostrils are upraised and assume a\r\n    crescentic outline.\r\n\r\n    I must still say a few words on some of the foreign Crested breeds. The\r\n    skull of a crested, rumpless, white Turkish fowl is very slightly\r\n    protuberant, and but little perforated; the ascending branches of the\r\n    premaxillary {265} are well developed. In another Turkish breed, called\r\n    Ghoondooks, the skull is considerably protuberant and perforated; the\r\n    ascending branches of the premaxillary are so much aborted that they\r\n    project only 1/15th of an inch; and the inner processes of the nasal\r\n    bone are so completely aborted, that the surface where they should have\r\n    projected is quite smooth. Here then we see these two bones modified to\r\n    an extreme degree. Of Sultans (another Turkish breed) I examined two\r\n    skulls; in that of the female the protuberance was much larger than in\r\n    the male. In both skulls the ascending branches of the premaxillary\r\n    were very short, and in both the basal portion of the inner processes\r\n    of the nasal bones were ossified together. These Sultan skulls differed\r\n    from those of English Polish fowls in the frontal bones, anteriorly to\r\n    the protuberance, not being broad.\r\n\r\n    The last skull which I need describe is a unique one, lent to me by Mr.\r\n    Tegetmeier: it resembles a Polish skull in most of its characters, but\r\n    has not the great frontal protuberance; it has, however, two rounded\r\n    knobs of a different nature, which stand more in front, above the\r\n    lachrymal bones. These curious knobs, into which the brain does not\r\n    enter, are separated from each other by a deep medial furrow; and this\r\n    is perforated by a few minute pores. The nasal bones stand rather wide\r\n    apart, with their inner processes, and the ascending branches of the\r\n    premaxillary, upturned and shortened. The two knobs no doubt supported\r\n    the two great horn-like projections of the comb.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 36.--Skull of Horned Fowl, of natural size, viewed\r\n    from above, a little obliquely. (In the possession of Mr. Tegetmeier.)]\r\n\r\n    From the foregoing facts we see in how astonishing a manner some of the\r\n    bones of the skull vary in Crested fowls. The protuberance may\r\n    certainly be called in one sense a monstrosity, as being wholly unlike\r\n    anything observed in nature: but as in ordinary cases it is not\r\n    injurious to the bird, and as it is strictly inherited, it can hardly\r\n    in another sense be called a monstrosity. A series may be formed\r\n    commencing with the black-boned Silk fowl, which has a very small crest\r\n    with the skull beneath penetrated only by a few minute orifices, but\r\n    with no other change in its structure; and from this first stage we may\r\n    proceed to fowls with a moderately large crest, which rests, according\r\n    to Bechstein, on a fleshy mass, but without any {266} protuberance in\r\n    the skull. I may add that I have seen a similar fleshy or fibrous mass\r\n    beneath the tuft of feathers on the head of the Tufted duck; and in\r\n    this case there was no actual protuberance in the skull, but it had\r\n    become a little more globular. Lastly, when we come to fowls with a\r\n    largely developed crest, the skull becomes largely protuberant and is\r\n    perforated by a multitude of irregular open spaces. The close relation\r\n    between the crest and the size of the bony protuberance is shown in\r\n    another way; for Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that if chickens lately\r\n    hatched be selected with a large bony protuberance, when adult they\r\n    will have a large crest. There can be no doubt that in former times the\r\n    breeder of Polish fowls attended solely to the crest, and not to the\r\n    skull; nevertheless, by increasing the crest, in which he has\r\n    wonderfully succeeded, he has unintentionally made the skull\r\n    protuberant to an astonishing degree; and through correlation of\r\n    growth, he has at the same time affected the form and relative\r\n    connexion of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the shape of the orifice\r\n    of the nose, the breadth of the frontal bones, the shape of the\r\n    post-lateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones, the\r\n    direction of the axis of the bony cavity of the ear, and lastly the\r\n    internal configuration of the whole skull together with the shape of\r\n    the brain.\r\n\r\n    _Vertebræ._--In _G. bankiva_ there are fourteen cervical, seven dorsal\r\n    with ribs, apparently fifteen lumbar and sacral, and six caudal\r\n    vertebræ;[431] but the lumbar and sacral are so much anchylosed that I\r\n    am not sure of their number, and this makes the comparison of the total\r\n    number of vertebræ in the several breeds difficult. I have spoken of\r\n    six caudal vertebræ, because the basal one is almost completely\r\n    anchylosed with the pelvis; but if we consider the number as seven, the\r\n    caudal vertebræ agree in all the skeletons. The cervical vertebræ are,\r\n    as just stated, in appearance fourteen; but out of twenty-three\r\n    skeletons in a fit state for examination, in five of them, namely, in\r\n    two Games, in two pencilled Hamburghs, and in a Polish, the fourteenth\r\n    vertebra bore ribs, which, though small, were perfectly developed with\r\n    a double articulation. The presence of these little ribs cannot be\r\n    considered as a fact of much importance, for all the cervical vertebræ\r\n    bear representatives of ribs; but their development in the fourteenth\r\n    vertebra reduces the size of the passages in the transverse processes,\r\n    and makes this vertebra exactly like the first dorsal vertebra. The\r\n    addition of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical\r\n    alone, for properly the ribs of the first true dorsal vertebra are\r\n    destitute of processes; but in some of the skeletons in which the\r\n    fourteenth cervical bore little ribs, the first pair of true ribs had\r\n    well-developed processes. When we know that the sparrow has only nine,\r\n    and the swan twenty-three cervical vertebræ,[432] we need feel no\r\n    surprise at the number of the cervical vertebræ in the fowl being, as\r\n    it appears, variable.\r\n\r\n    There are seven dorsal vertebræ bearing ribs; the first dorsal is never\r\n    {267} anchylosed with the succeeding four, which are generally\r\n    anchylosed together. In one Sultan fowl, however, the two first dorsal\r\n    vertebræ were free. In two skeletons, the fifth dorsal was free;\r\n    generally the sixth is free (as in _G. bankiva_), but sometimes only at\r\n    its posterior end, where in contact with the seventh. The seventh\r\n    dorsal vertebra, in every case excepting in one Spanish cock, was\r\n    anchylosed with the lumbar vertebræ. So that the degree to which these\r\n    middle dorsal vertebræ are anchylosed together is variable.\r\n\r\n    Seven is the normal number of true ribs, but in two skeletons of the\r\n    Sultan fowl (in which the fourteenth cervical vertebra was not\r\n    furnished with little ribs) there were eight pairs; the eighth pair\r\n    seemed to be developed on a vertebra corresponding with the first\r\n    lumbar in _G. bankiva_; the sternal portion of both the seventh and\r\n    eighth ribs did not reach the sternum. In four skeletons in which ribs\r\n    were developed on the fourteenth cervical vertebra, there were, when\r\n    these cervical ribs are included, eight pairs; but in one Game-cock, in\r\n    which the fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs, there were only\r\n    six pairs of true dorsal ribs; the sixth pair in this case did not have\r\n    processes, and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons; in\r\n    this game-cock, as far as could be judged from the appearance of the\r\n    lumbar vertebræ, a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs was missing. We\r\n    thus see that the ribs (whether or not the little pair attached to the\r\n    fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted) vary from six to eight pair.\r\n    The sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes. The sternal\r\n    portion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in Cochins, and is\r\n    completely ossified. As previously stated, it is scarcely possible to\r\n    count the lumbo-sacral vertebræ; but they certainly do not correspond\r\n    in shape or number in the several skeletons. The caudal vertebræ are\r\n    closely similar in all the skeletons, the only difference being,\r\n    whether or not the basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis; they hardly\r\n    vary even in length, not being shorter in Cochins, with their short\r\n    tail-feathers, than in other breeds; in a Spanish cock, however, the\r\n    caudal vertebræ were a little elongated. In three rumpless fowls the\r\n    caudal vertebræ were few in number, and anchylosed together into a\r\n    misformed mass.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 37.--Sixth Cervical Vertebra, of natural size,\r\n    viewed laterally. A. Wild _Gallus bankiva_. B. Cochin Cock.]\r\n\r\n    In the individual vertebræ the differences in structure are very\r\n    slight. In the atlas the cavity for the occipital condyle is either\r\n    ossified into a ring, or is, as in Bankiva, open on its upper margin.\r\n    The upper arc of the spinal canal is a little more arched in Cochins,\r\n    in conformity with the shape of occipital foramen, than in _G.\r\n    bankiva_. In several skeletons a difference, but not of much\r\n    importance, may be observed, which commences a the fourth cervical\r\n    vertebra, and is greatest at about the sixth, seventh, or eighth\r\n    vertebra; this consists in the hæmal descending processes being united\r\n    to the body of the vertebra by a sort of buttress. This structure may\r\n    be observed in Cochins, Polish, some Hamburgh, and probably other\r\n    breeds; but is absent, or barely developed, in Game, Dorking, Spanish,\r\n    Bantam, and {268} several other breeds examined by me. On the dorsal\r\n    surface of the sixth cervical vertebra in Cochins three prominent\r\n    points are more strongly developed than in the corresponding vertebra\r\n    of the Game-fowl or _G. bankiva_.\r\n\r\n    _Pelvis._--This differs in some few points in the several skeletons.\r\n    The anterior margin of the ilium seems at first to vary much in\r\n    outline, but this is chiefly due to the degree to which the margin in\r\n    the middle part is ossified to the crest of the spine; the outline,\r\n    however, does differ in being more truncated in Bantams, and more\r\n    rounded in certain breeds, as in Cochins. The outline of the ischiadic\r\n    foramen differs considerably, being nearly circular in Bantams, instead\r\n    of egg-shaped as in the Bankiva, and more regularly oval in some\r\n    skeletons, as in the Spanish. The obturator notch is also much less\r\n    elongated in some skeletons than in others. The end of the pubic bone\r\n    presents the greatest difference; being hardly enlarged in the Bankiva;\r\n    considerably and gradually enlarged in Cochins, and in a lesser degree\r\n    in some other breeds; and abruptly enlarged in Bantams. In one Bantam\r\n    this bone extended very little beyond the extremity of the ischium. The\r\n    whole pelvis in this latter bird differed widely in its proportions,\r\n    being far broader proportionally to its length than in Bankiva.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Extremity of the Furcula, of natural size,\r\n    viewed laterally. A. Wild _Gallus bankiva_. B. Spangled Polish Fowl. C.\r\n    Spanish Fowl. D. Dorking Fowl.]\r\n\r\n    _Sternum._--This bone is generally so much deformed that it is scarcely\r\n    possible to compare its form strictly in the several breeds. The shape\r\n    of the triangular extremity of the lateral processes differs\r\n    considerably, being either almost equilateral or much elongated. The\r\n    front margin of the crest is more or less perpendicular and varies\r\n    greatly, as does the curvature of the posterior end, and the flatness\r\n    of the lower surface. The outline of the manubrial process also varies,\r\n    being wedge-shaped in the Bankiva, and rounded in the Spanish breed.\r\n    The _furcula_ differs in being more or less arched, and greatly, as may\r\n    be seen in the accompanying outlines, in the shape of the terminal\r\n    plate; but the shape of this part differed a little in two skeletons of\r\n    the wild Bankiva. The _coracoids_ present no difference worth notice.\r\n    The _scapula_ varies in shape, being of nearly uniform breadth in\r\n    Bankiva, much broader in the middle in the Polish fowl, and abruptly\r\n    narrowed towards the apex in the two Sultan fowls.\r\n\r\n    I carefully compared each separate bone of the leg and wing, relatively\r\n    to the same bones in the wild Bankiva, in the following breeds, which I\r\n    thought were the most likely to differ; namely, in Cochin, Dorking,\r\n    {269} Spanish, Polish, Burmese Bantam, Frizzled Indian, and black-boned\r\n    Silk fowls; and it was truly surprising to see how absolutely every\r\n    process, articulation, and pore agreed, though the bones differed\r\n    greatly in size. The agreement is far more absolute than in other parts\r\n    of the skeleton. In stating this, I do not refer to the relative\r\n    thickness and length of the several bones; for the tarsi varied\r\n    considerably in both these respects. But the other limb-bones varied\r\n    little even in relative length.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have not examined a sufficient number of skeletons to say\r\nwhether any of the foregoing differences, except in the skull, are\r\ncharacteristic of the several breeds. Apparently some differences are more\r\ncommon in certain breeds than in others,--as an additional rib to the\r\nfourteenth cervical vertebra in Hamburghs and Games, and the breadth of the\r\nend of the pubic bone in Cochins. Both skeletons of the Sultan fowl had\r\neight dorsal vertebræ, and the end of the scapula in both was somewhat\r\nattenuated. In the skull, the deep medial furrow in the frontal bones and\r\nthe vertically elongated occipital foramen seem to be characteristic of\r\nCochins; as is the great breadth of the frontal bones in Dorkings; the\r\nseparation and open spaces between the tips of the ascending branches of\r\nthe premaxillaries and nasal bones, as well as the front part of the skull\r\nbeing but little depressed, characterise Hamburghs; the globular shape of\r\nthe posterior part of the skull seems to be characteristic of laced\r\nBantams; and lastly, the protuberance of the skull with the ascending\r\nbranches of the premaxillaries partially aborted, together with the other\r\ndifferences before specified, are eminently characteristic of Polish and\r\nother Crested fowls.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking result of our examination of the skeleton is the\r\ngreat variability of all the bones except those of the extremities. To a\r\ncertain extent we can understand why the skeleton fluctuates so much in\r\nstructure; fowls have been exposed to unnatural conditions of life, and\r\ntheir whole organisation has thus been rendered variable; but the breeder\r\nis quite indifferent to, and never intentionally selects, any modifications\r\nin the skeleton. External characters, if not attended to by man,--such as\r\nthe number of the tail and wing feathers and their relative lengths, which\r\nin wild birds are generally constant points,--fluctuate in our domestic\r\nfowls in the same manner as the several parts of the skeleton. An\r\nadditional toe is a \"point\" in Dorkings, and has become a fixed character,\r\nbut is variable in {270} Cochins and Silk-fowls. The colour of the plumage\r\nand the form of the comb are in most breeds, or even sub-breeds, eminently\r\nfixed characters; but in Dorkings these points have not been attended to,\r\nand are variable. When any modification in the skeleton is related to some\r\nexternal character which man values, it has been, unintentionally on his\r\npart, acted on by selection, and has become more or less fixed. We see this\r\nin the wonderful protuberance of the skull, which supports the crest of\r\nfeathers in Polish fowls, and which by correlation has affected other parts\r\nof the skull. We see the same result in the two protuberances which support\r\nthe horns in the horned fowl, and in the flattened shape of the front of\r\nthe skull in Hamburghs consequent on their flattened and broad\r\n\"rose-combs.\" We know not in the least whether additional ribs, or the\r\nchanged outline of the occipital foramen, or the changed form of the\r\nscapula, or of the extremity of the furcula, are in any way correlated with\r\nother structures, or have arisen from the changed conditions and habits of\r\nlife to which our fowls have been subjected; but there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that these various modifications in the skeleton could be rendered,\r\neither by direct selection, or by the selection of correlated structures,\r\nas constant and as characteristic of each breed, as are the size and shape\r\nof the body, the colour of the plumage, and the form of the comb.\r\n\r\n_Effects of the Disuse of Parts._\r\n\r\n    Judging from the habits of our European gallinaceous birds, _Gallus\r\n    bankiva_ in its native haunts would use its legs and wings more than do\r\n    our domestic fowls, which rarely fly except to their roosts. The Silk\r\n    and the Frizzled fowls, from having imperfect wing-feathers, cannot fly\r\n    at all; and there is reason to believe that both these breeds are\r\n    ancient, so that their progenitors during many generations cannot have\r\n    flown. The Cochins, also, from their short wings and heavy bodies, can\r\n    hardly fly up to a low perch. Therefore in these breeds, especially in\r\n    the two first, a considerable diminution in the wing-bones might have\r\n    been expected, but this is not the case. In every specimen, after\r\n    disarticulating and cleaning the bones, I carefully compared the\r\n    relative length of the two main bones of the wing to each other, and of\r\n    the two main bones of the leg to each other, with those of _G.\r\n    bankiva_; and it was surprising to see (except in the case of the\r\n    tarsi) how exactly the same relative length had been retained. This\r\n    fact is curious, from showing how truly the proportions of an organ may\r\n    be inherited, although not fully exercised during many generations. I\r\n    then compared in several breeds the {271} length of the femur and tibia\r\n    with the humerus and ulna, and likewise these same bones with those of\r\n    _G. bankiva_; the result was that the wing-bones in all the breeds\r\n    (except the Burmese Jumper, which has unnaturally short legs) are\r\n    slightly shortened relatively to the leg-bones; but the decrease is so\r\n    slight that it may be due to the standard specimen of _G. bankiva_\r\n    having accidentally had wings of slightly greater length than usual; so\r\n    that the measurements are not worth giving. But it deserves notice that\r\n    the Silk and Frizzled fowls, which are quite incapable of flight, had\r\n    their wings _less_ reduced relatively to their legs than in almost any\r\n    other breed! We have seen with domesticated pigeons that the bones of\r\n    the wings are somewhat reduced in length, whilst the primary feathers\r\n    are rather increased in length, and it is just possible, though not\r\n    probable, that in the Silk and Frizzled fowls any tendency to decrease\r\n    in the length of the wing-bones from disuse may have been checked\r\n    through the law of compensation, by the decreased growth of the\r\n    wing-feathers, and consequent increased supply of nutriment. The\r\n    wing-bones, however, in both these breeds, are found to be slightly\r\n    reduced in length when judged by the standard of the length of the\r\n    sternum or head, relatively to these same parts in _G. bankiva_.\r\n\r\n    The actual weight of the main bones of the leg and wing in twelve\r\n    breeds is given in the two first columns in the following table. The\r\n    calculated weight of the wing-bones relatively to the leg-bones, in\r\n    comparison with the leg and wing-bones of _G. bankiva_, are given in\r\n    the third column,--the weight of the wing-bones in _G. bankiva_ being\r\n    called a hundred.[433]\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------+---------+---------+----------------+\r\n  |                                  |         |         | Weight of      |\r\n  |                                  | Actual  | Actual  | Wingbones      |\r\n  |                                  | Weight  | Weight  | relatively to  |\r\n  |         Names of Breeds.         | of      | of      | the Leg-bones, |\r\n  |                                  | Femur   | Humerus | in comparison  |\r\n  |                                  | and     | and     | with these     |\r\n  |                                  | Tibia.  | Ulna.   | same bones in  |\r\n  |                                  | Grains. | Grains. | G. bankiva.    |\r\n  +--+-------------------------------+---------+---------+----------------+\r\n  |  |Gallus bankiva       wild male |   86    |  54     |   100          |\r\n  | 1|Cochin               male      |  311    | 162     |    83          |\r\n  | 2|Dorking              male      |  557    | 248     |    70          |\r\n  | 3|Spanish (Minorca)    male      |  386    | 183     |    75          |\r\n  | 4|Gold Spangled Polish male      |  306    | 145     |    75          |\r\n  | 5|Game, black-breasted male      |  293    | 143     |    77          |\r\n  | 6|Malay                female    |  231    | 116     |    80          |\r\n  | 7|Sultan               male      |  189    |  94     |    79          |\r\n  | 8|Indian Frizzled      male      |  206    |  88     |    67          |\r\n  | 9|Burmese Jumper       female    |   53    |  36     |   108          |\r\n  |10|Hamburgh (pencilled) male      |  157    | 104     |   106          |\r\n  |11|Hamburgh (pencilled) female    |  114    |  77     |   108          |\r\n  |12|Silk (black-boned)   female    |   88    |  57     |   103          |\r\n  +--+-------------------------------+---------+---------+----------------+\r\n\r\n{272}\r\n\r\n    In the eight first birds, belonging to distinct breeds, in this table,\r\n    we see a decided reduction in the weight of the bones of the wing. In\r\n    the Indian Frizzled fowl, which cannot fly, the reduction is carried to\r\n    the greatest extent, namely, to thirty-three per cent. of their proper\r\n    proportional weight. In the next four birds, including the Silk-hen,\r\n    which is incapable of flight, we see that the wings, relatively to the\r\n    legs, are slightly increased in weight; but it should be observed that,\r\n    if in these birds the legs had become from any cause reduced in weight,\r\n    this would give the false appearance of the wings having increased in\r\n    relative weight. Now a reduction of this nature has certainly occurred\r\n    with the Burmese Jumper, in which the legs are abnormally short, and in\r\n    the two Hamburghs and Silk fowl, the legs, though not short, are formed\r\n    of remarkably thin and light bones. I make these statements, not\r\n    judging by mere eyesight, but after having calculated the weights of\r\n    the leg-bones relatively to those of _G. bankiva_, according to the\r\n    only two standards of comparison which I could use, namely, the\r\n    relative lengths of the head and sternum; for I do not know the weight\r\n    of the body in _G. bankiva_, which would have been a better standard.\r\n    According to these standards, the leg-bones in these four fowls are in\r\n    a marked manner far lighter than in any other breed. It may therefore\r\n    be concluded that in all cases in which the legs have not been through\r\n    some unknown cause much reduced in weight, the wing-bones have become\r\n    reduced in weight relatively to the leg-bones, in comparison with those\r\n    of _G. bankiva_. And this reduction of weight may, I apprehend, safely\r\n    be attributed to disuse.\r\n\r\n    To make the foregoing table quite satisfactory, it ought to have been\r\n    shown that in the eight first birds the leg-bones have not actually\r\n    increased in weight out of due proportion with the rest of the body;\r\n    this I cannot show, from not knowing, as already remarked, the weight\r\n    of the wild Bankiva.[434] I am indeed inclined to suspect that the\r\n    leg-bones in the Dorking, No. 2 in the table, are proportionally too\r\n    heavy; but this bird was a very large one, weighing 7 lb. 2 oz., though\r\n    very thin. Its leg-bones were more than ten times as heavy as those of\r\n    the Burmese Jumper! I tried to ascertain the length both of the\r\n    leg-bones and wing-bones relatively to other parts of the body and\r\n    skeleton; but the whole organisation in these birds, which have been so\r\n    long domesticated, has become so variable, that no certain conclusions\r\n    could be reached. For instance, the legs of the above Dorking cock were\r\n    nearly three-quarters of an inch too short relatively to the length of\r\n    the sternum, and more than {273} three-quarters of an inch too long\r\n    relatively to the length of the skull, in comparison with these same\r\n    parts in _G. bankiva_.\r\n\r\n    In the following Table II. in the two first columns we see in inches\r\n    and decimals the length of the sternum, and the extreme depth of its\r\n    crest to which the pectoral muscles are attached. In the third column\r\n    we have the calculated depth of the crest, relatively to the length of\r\n    the sternum, in comparison with these same parts in _G. bankiva_.[435]\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+-----------+------------+----------------+\r\n  |                             |           |            | Depth of Crest,|\r\n  |                             |           |            | relatively to  |\r\n  |                             |  Length   | Depth of   | the length of  |\r\n  |    Names of Breeds.         |   of      |   Crest    | the Sternum in |\r\n  |                             |  Sternum. | of Sternum.| comparison with|\r\n  |                             |           |            | G. bankiva.    |\r\n  +--+--------------------------+-----------+------------+----------------+\r\n  |  |                          |  Inches.  |  Inches.   |                |\r\n  |  |Gallus bankiva      male  |   4.20    |   1.40     |    100         |\r\n  | 1|Cochin              male  |   5.83    |   1.55     |     78         |\r\n  | 2|Dorking             male  |   6.95    |   1.97     |     84         |\r\n  | 3|Spanish             male  |   6.10    |   1.83     |     90         |\r\n  | 4|Polish              male  |   5.07    |   1.50     |     87         |\r\n  | 5|Game                male  |   5.55    |   1.55     |     81         |\r\n  | 6|Malay             female  |   5.10    |   1.50     |     87         |\r\n  | 7|Sultan              male  |   4.47    |   1.36     |     90         |\r\n  | 8|Frizzled hen        male  |   4.25    |   1.20     |     84         |\r\n  | 9|Burmese Jumper    female  |   3.06    |   0.85     |     81         |\r\n  |10|Hamburgh            male  |   5.08    |   1.40     |     81         |\r\n  |11|Hamburgh          female  |   4.55    |   1.26     |     81         |\r\n  |12|Silk fowl         female  |   4.49    |   1.01     |     66         |\r\n  +--+--------------------------+-----------+------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n    By looking to the third column we see that in every case the depth of\r\n    the crest relatively to the length of the sternum, in comparison with\r\n    _G. bankiva_, is diminished, generally between 10 and 20 per cent. But\r\n    the degree of reduction varies much, partly in consequence of the\r\n    frequently deformed state of the sternum. In the Silk-fowl, which\r\n    cannot fly, the crest is 34 per cent. less deep than what it ought to\r\n    have been. This reduction of the crest in all the breeds probably\r\n    accounts for the great variability, before referred to, in the\r\n    curvature of the furcula, and in the shape of its sternal extremity.\r\n    Medical men believe that the abnormal form of the spine so commonly\r\n    observed in women of the higher ranks results from the attached muscles\r\n    not being fully exercised. So it is with our domestic fowls, for they\r\n    use their pectoral muscles but little, and, out of twenty-five sternums\r\n    examined by me, three alone were perfectly symmetrical, ten were\r\n    moderately crooked, and twelve were deformed to an extreme degree.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may conclude with respect to the various breeds of the fowl,\r\nthat the main bones of the wing have probably been shortened in a very\r\nslight degree; that they have {274} certainly become lighter relatively to\r\nthe leg-bones in all the breeds in which these latter bones are not\r\nunnaturally short or delicate; and that the crest of the sternum, to which\r\nthe pectoral muscles are attached, has invariably become less prominent,\r\nthe whole sternum being also extremely liable to deformity. These results\r\nwe may attribute to the lessened use of the wings.\r\n\r\n_Correlation of Growth_.--I will here sum up the few facts which I have\r\ncollected on this obscure, but important, subject. In Cochins and\r\nGame-fowls there is some relation between the colour of the plumage and the\r\ndarkness of the egg-shell and even of the yolk. In Sultans the additional\r\nsickle-feathers in the tail are apparently related to the general\r\nredundancy of the plumage, as shown by the feathered legs, large crest, and\r\nbeard. In two tailless fowls which I examined the oil-gland was aborted. A\r\nlarge crest of feathers, as Mr. Tegetmeier has remarked, seems always\r\naccompanied by a great diminution or almost entire absence of the comb. A\r\nlarge beard is similarly accompanied by diminished or absent wattles. These\r\nlatter cases apparently come under the law of compensation or balancement\r\nof growth. A large beard beneath the lower jaw and a large top-knot on the\r\nskull often go together. The comb when of any peculiar shape, as with\r\nHorned, Spanish, and Hamburgh fowls, affects in a corresponding manner the\r\nunderlying skull; and we have seen how wonderfully this is the case with\r\nCrested fowls when the crest is largely developed. With the protuberance of\r\nthe frontal bones the shape of the internal surface of the skull and of the\r\nbrain is greatly modified. The presence of a crest influences in some\r\nunknown way the development of the ascending branches of the premaxillary\r\nbone, and of the inner processes of the nasal bones; and likewise the shape\r\nof the external orifice of the nostrils. There is a plain and curious\r\ncorrelation between a crest of feathers and the imperfectly ossified\r\ncondition of the skull. Not only does this hold good with nearly all\r\ncrested fowls, but likewise with tufted ducks, and as Dr. Günther informs\r\nme with tufted geese in Germany.\r\n\r\nLastly, the feathers composing the crest in male Polish fowls resemble\r\nhackles, and differ greatly in shape from those in the crest of the female.\r\nThe neck, wing-coverts, and loins {275} in the male bird are properly\r\ncovered with hackles, and it would appear that feathers of this shape have\r\nspread by correlation to the head of the male. This little fact is\r\ninteresting; because, though both sexes of some wild gallinaceous birds\r\nhave their heads similarly ornamented, yet there is often a difference in\r\nthe size and shape of feathers forming their crests. Furthermore there is\r\nin some cases, as in the male Gold and in the male Amherst pheasants (_P.\r\npictus_ and _Amherstiæ_), a close relation in colour, as well as in\r\nstructure, between the plumes on the head and on the loins. Hence it would\r\nappear that the same law has regulated the state of the feathers on the\r\nhead and body, both with species living under their natural conditions, and\r\nwith birds which have varied under domestication.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{276}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDUCKS--GOOSE--PEACOCK--TURKEY--GUINEA-FOWL--CANARY-BIRD--GOLD-FISH--\r\nHIVE-BEES--SILK-MOTHS.\r\n\r\n    DUCKS, SEVERAL BREEDS OF--PROGRESS OF DOMESTICATION--ORIGIN OF, FROM\r\n    THE COMMON WILD-DUCK--DIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT BREEDS--OSTEOLOGICAL\r\n    DIFFERENCES--EFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE ON THE LIMB-BONES.\r\n\r\n    GOOSE, ANCIENTLY DOMESTICATED--LITTLE VARIATION OF--SEBASTOPOL BREED.\r\n\r\n    PEACOCK, ORIGIN OF BLACK-SHOULDERED BREED.\r\n\r\n    TURKEY, BREEDS OF--CROSSED WITH THE UNITED STATES SPECIES--EFFECTS OF\r\n    CLIMATE ON.\r\n\r\n    GUINEA-FOWL, CANARY-BIRD, GOLD-FISH, HIVE-BEES.\r\n\r\n    SILK-MOTHS, SPECIES AND BREEDS OF--ANCIENTLY DOMESTICATED--CARE IN\r\n    THEIR SELECTION--DIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT RACES--IN THE EGG,\r\n    CATERPILLAR, AND COCOON STATES--INHERITANCE OF CHARACTERS--IMPERFECT\r\n    WINGS--LOST INSTINCTS--CORRELATED CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nI will, as in previous cases, first briefly describe the chief domestic\r\nbreeds of the duck:--\r\n\r\n    BREED 1. _Common Domestic Duck_.--Varies much in colour and in\r\n    proportions, and differs in instincts and disposition from the\r\n    wild-duck. There are several sub-breeds:--(1) The Aylesbury, of great\r\n    size, white, with pale-yellow beak and legs; abdominal sack largely\r\n    developed. (2) The Rouen, of great size, coloured like the wild-duck,\r\n    with green or mottled beak; abdominal sack largely developed. (3)\r\n    Tufted Duck, with a large top-knot of fine downy feathers, supported on\r\n    a fleshy mass, with the skull perforated beneath. The top-knot in a\r\n    duck which I imported from Holland was two and a half inches in\r\n    diameter. (4) Labrador (or Canadian, or Buenos Ayres, or East Indian);\r\n    plumage entirely black; beak broader, relatively to its length, than in\r\n    the wild-duck; eggs slightly tinted with black. This sub-breed perhaps\r\n    ought to be ranked as a breed; it includes two sub-varieties, one as\r\n    large as the common domestic duck, which I have kept alive, and the\r\n    other smaller and often capable of flight.[436] I presume it is this\r\n    latter sub-variety which has been described in France[437] as flying\r\n    well, being rather wild, and when cooked having the flavour of the\r\n    wild-duck; nevertheless this sub-variety is polygamous, like other\r\n    domesticated ducks and unlike the wild duck. These black Labrador ducks\r\n    breed true; {277} but a case is given by Dr. Turral of the French\r\n    sub-variety producing young with some white feathers on the head and\r\n    neck, and with an ochre-coloured patch on the breast.\r\n\r\n    BREED 2. _Hook-billed Duck_.--This bird presents an extraordinary\r\n    appearance from the downward curvature of the beak. The head is often\r\n    tufted. The common colour is white, but some are coloured like\r\n    wild-ducks. It is an ancient breed, having been noticed in 1676.[438]\r\n    It shows its prolonged domestication by almost incessantly laying eggs,\r\n    like the fowls which are called everlasting layers.[439]\r\n\r\n    BREED 3. _Call-Duck_.--Remarkable from its small size, and from the\r\n    extraordinary loquacity of the female. Beak short. These birds are\r\n    either white, or coloured like the wild-duck.\r\n\r\n    BREED 4. _Penguin Duck_.--This is the most remarkable of all the\r\n    breeds, and seems to have originated in the Malayan archipelago. It\r\n    walks with its body extremely erect, and with its thin neck stretched\r\n    straight upwards. Beak rather short. Tail upturned, including only 18\r\n    feathers. Femur and meta-tarsi elongated.\r\n\r\nAlmost all naturalists admit that the several breeds are descended from the\r\ncommon wild duck (_Anas boschas_); most fanciers, on the other hand, take\r\nas usual a very different view.[440] Unless we deny that domestication,\r\nprolonged during centuries, can affect even such unimportant characters as\r\ncolour, size, and in a slight degree proportional dimensions and mental\r\ndisposition, there is no reason whatever to doubt that the domestic duck is\r\ndescended from the common wild species, for the one differs from the other\r\nin no important character. We have some historical evidence with respect to\r\nthe period and progress of the domestication of the duck. It was\r\nunknown[441] to the ancient Egyptians, to the Jews of the Old Testament,\r\nand to the Greeks of the Homeric period. About eighteen centuries ago\r\nColumella[442] and Varro speak of the necessity of keeping ducks in netted\r\nenclosures like other wild fowl, so that at this period there was danger of\r\ntheir flying away. {278} Moreover, the plan recommended by Columella to\r\nthose who might wish to increase their stock of ducks, namely, to collect\r\nthe eggs of the wild bird and to place them under a hen, shows, as Mr.\r\nDixon remarks, \"that the duck had not at this time become a naturalised and\r\nprolific inmate of the Roman poultry-yard.\" The origin of the domestic duck\r\nfrom the wild species is recognised in nearly every language of Europe, as\r\nAldrovandi long ago remarked, by the same name being applied to both. The\r\nwild duck has a wide range from the Himalayas to North America. It crosses\r\nreadily with the domestic bird, and the crossed offspring are perfectly\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\nBoth in North America and Europe the wild duck has been found easy to tame\r\nand breed. In Sweden this experiment was carefully tried by Tiburtius; he\r\nsucceeded in rearing wild ducks for three generations, but, though they\r\nwere treated like common ducks, they did not vary even in a single feather.\r\nThe young birds suffered from being allowed to swim about in cold\r\nwater,[443] as is known to be the case, though the fact is a strange one,\r\nwith the young of the common domestic duck. An accurate and well-known\r\nobserver in England[444] has described in detail his often repeated and\r\nsuccessful experiments in domesticating the wild duck. Young birds are\r\neasily reared from eggs hatched under a bantam; but to succeed it is\r\nindispensable not to place the eggs of both the wild and tame duck under\r\nthe same hen, for in this case \"the young wild ducks die off, leaving their\r\nmore hardy brethren in undisturbed possession of their foster-mother's\r\ncare. The difference of habit at the onset in the newly-hatched ducklings\r\nalmost entails such a result to a certainty.\" The wild ducklings were from\r\nthe first quite tame towards those who took care of them as long as they\r\nwore the same clothes, and likewise to the dogs and cats of the house. They\r\nwould even snap with their beaks at the dogs, and drive them away from any\r\nspot which they coveted. But they were much alarmed at strange men and\r\ndogs. Differently from what {279} occurred in Sweden, Mr. Hewitt found that\r\nhis young birds always changed and deteriorated in character in the course\r\nof two or three generations; notwithstanding that great care was taken to\r\nprevent any crossing with tame ducks. After the third generation his birds\r\nlost the elegant carriage of the wild species, and began to acquire the\r\ngait of the common duck. They increased in size in each generation, and\r\ntheir legs became less fine. The white collar round the neck of the mallard\r\nbecame broader and less regular, and some of the longer primary\r\nwing-feathers became more or less white. When this occurred, Mr. Hewitt\r\nalways destroyed his old stock and procured fresh eggs from wild nests; so\r\nthat he never bred the same family for more than five or six generations.\r\nHis birds continued to pair together, and never became polygamous like the\r\ncommon domestic duck. I have given these details, because no other case, as\r\nfar as I know, has been so carefully recorded by a competent observer of\r\nthe progress of change in wild birds reared for several generations in a\r\ndomestic condition.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations there can hardly be a doubt that the wild duck is\r\nthe parent of the common domestic kind; nor need we look to distinct\r\nspecies for the parentage of the more distinct breeds, namely, Penguin,\r\nCall, Hook-billed, Tufted, and Labrador ducks. I will not repeat the\r\narguments used in the previous chapters on the improbability of man having\r\nin ancient times domesticated several species since become unknown or\r\nextinct, though ducks are not readily exterminated in the wild state;--on\r\nsome of the supposed parent-species having had abnormal characters in\r\ncomparison with all the other species of the genus, as with hook-billed and\r\npenguin ducks;--on all the breeds, as far as is known, being fertile\r\ntogether;[445]--on all the breeds having the same general disposition,\r\ninstinct, &c. But one fact bearing on this question may be noticed: in the\r\ngreat duck family, one species alone, namely, the male of {280} _A.\r\nboschas_, has its four middle tail-feathers curled upwardly; now in every\r\none of the above-named domestic breeds these curled feathers exist, and on\r\nthe supposition that they are descended from distinct species, we must\r\nassume that man formerly hit upon species all of which had this now unique\r\ncharacter. Moreover, sub-varieties of each breed are coloured almost\r\nexactly like the wild duck, as I have seen with the largest and smallest\r\nbreeds, namely Rouens and Call-ducks, and, as Mr. Brent states,[446] is the\r\ncase with Hook-billed ducks. This gentleman, as he informs me, crossed a\r\nwhite Aylesbury drake and a black Labrador duck, and some of the ducklings\r\nas they grew up assumed the plumage of the wild duck.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Penguins, I have not seen many specimens, and none were\r\ncoloured precisely like the wild duck; but Sir James Brooke sent me three\r\nskins from Lombok and Bali, in the Malayan archipelago; the two females\r\nwere paler and more rufous than the wild duck, and the drake differed in\r\nhaving the whole under and upper surface (excepting the neck, tail-coverts,\r\ntail, and wings) silver-grey, finely pencilled with dark lines, closely\r\nlike certain parts of the plumage of the wild mallard. But I found this\r\ndrake to be identical in every feather with a variety of the common breed\r\nprocured from a farm-yard in Kent, and I have occasionally elsewhere seen\r\nsimilar specimens. The occurrence of a duck bred under so peculiar a\r\nclimate as that of the Malayan archipelago, where the wild species does not\r\nexist, with exactly the same plumage as may occasionally be seen in our\r\nfarm-yards, is a fact worth notice. Nevertheless the climate of the Malayan\r\narchipelago apparently does tend to cause the duck to vary much, for\r\nZollinger,[447] speaking of the Penguin breed, says that in Lombok \"there\r\nis an unusual and very wonderful variety of ducks.\" One Penguin drake which\r\nI kept alive differed from those of which the skins were sent me from\r\nLombok, in having its breast and back partially coloured with\r\nchestnut-brown, thus more closely resembling the Mallard.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts, more especially from the drakes of all the breeds\r\nhaving curled tail-feathers, and from certain sub-varieties in each breed\r\noccasionally resembling in general {281} plumage the wild duck, we may\r\nconclude with confidence that all the breeds are descended from _A.\r\nboschas_.\r\n\r\n    I will now notice some of the peculiarities characteristic of the\r\n    several breeds. The eggs vary in colour; some common ducks laying\r\n    pale-greenish and others quite white eggs. The eggs which are first\r\n    laid during each season by the black Labrador duck, are tinted black,\r\n    as if rubbed with ink. So that with ducks, as with poultry, some degree\r\n    of correlation exists between the colour of the plumage and the\r\n    egg-shell. A good observer assured me that one year his Labrador ducks\r\n    laid almost perfectly white eggs, but that the yolks were this same\r\n    season dirty olive-green, instead of as usual of a golden yellow, so\r\n    that the black tint appeared to have passed inwards. Another curious\r\n    case shows what singular variations sometimes occur and are inherited;\r\n    Mr. Hansell[448] relates that he had a common duck which always laid\r\n    eggs with the yolk of a dark-brown colour like melted glue; and the\r\n    young ducks, hatched from these eggs, laid the same kind of eggs, so\r\n    that the breed had to be destroyed.\r\n\r\n    The hook-billed duck has a most remarkable appearance (see fig. of\r\n    skull, woodcut No. 39); and its peculiar beak has been inherited at\r\n    least since the year 1676. This structure is evidently analogous with\r\n    that described in the Bagadotten carrier pigeon. Mr. Brent[449] says\r\n    that, when hook-billed ducks are crossed with common ducks, \"many young\r\n    ones are produced with the upper mandible shorter than the lower, which\r\n    not unfrequently causes the death of the bird.\" A tuft of feathers on\r\n    the head is by no means a rare occurrence; namely, in the true tufted\r\n    breed, the hook-billed, the common farmyard duck, and in a duck having\r\n    no other peculiarity which was sent to me from the Malayan archipelago.\r\n    The tuft is only so far interesting as it affects the skull, which is\r\n    thus rendered slightly more globular, and is perforated by numerous\r\n    apertures. Call-ducks are remarkable from their extraordinary\r\n    loquacity: the drake only hisses like common drakes; nevertheless, when\r\n    paired with the common duck, he transmits to his female offspring a\r\n    strong quacking tendency. This loquacity seems at first a surprising\r\n    character to have been acquired under domestication. But the voice\r\n    varies in the different breeds; Mr. Brent[450] says that hook-billed\r\n    ducks are very loquacious, and that Rouens utter a \"dull, loud, and\r\n    monotonous cry, easily distinguishable by an experienced ear.\" As the\r\n    loquacity of the Call-duck is highly serviceable, these birds being\r\n    used in decoys, this quality may have been increased by selection. For\r\n    instance, Colonel Hawker says, if young wild-ducks cannot be got for a\r\n    decoy, \"by way of make-shift, _select_ tame birds which are the most\r\n    clamorous, even if their colour should not be like that of wild\r\n    ones.\"[451] It has been {282} falsely asserted that Call-ducks hatch\r\n    their eggs in less time than common ducks.[452]\r\n\r\n    The Penguin duck is the most remarkable of all the breeds; the thin\r\n    neck and body are carried erect; the wings are small; the tail is\r\n    upturned; and the thigh-bones and metatarsi are considerably lengthened\r\n    in proportion with the same bones in the wild duck. In five specimens\r\n    examined by me there were only eighteen tail-feathers instead of twenty\r\n    as in the wild duck; but I have also found only eighteen and nineteen\r\n    tail-feathers in two Labrador ducks. On the middle toe, in three\r\n    specimens, there were twenty-seven or twenty-eight scutellæ, whereas in\r\n    two wild ducks there were thirty-one and thirty-two. The Penguin when\r\n    crossed transmits with much power its peculiar form of body and gait to\r\n    its offspring; this was manifest with some hybrids raised in the\r\n    Zoological Gardens between one of these birds and the Egyptian\r\n    goose[453] (_Anser Ægyptiacus_), and likewise with some mongrels which\r\n    I raised between the Penguin and Labrador duck. I am not much surprised\r\n    that some writers have maintained that this breed must be descended\r\n    from an unknown and distinct species; but from the reasons already\r\n    assigned, it seems to me far more probable that it is the descendant,\r\n    much modified by domestication under an unnatural climate, of _Anas\r\n    boschas_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 39.--Skulls, viewed laterally, reduced to\r\n    two-thirds of the natural size. A. Wild Duck. B. Hook-billed Duck.]\r\n\r\n    _Osteological Characters._--The skulls of the several breeds differ\r\n    from each other and from the skull of the wild duck in very little\r\n    except in the proportional length and curvature of the premaxillaries.\r\n    These latter bones in the Call-duck are short, and a line drawn from\r\n    their extremities to the summit of the skull is nearly straight,\r\n    instead of being concave as in the {283} common duck; so that the skull\r\n    resembles that of a small goose. In the hook-billed duck (fig. 39)\r\n    these same bones as well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most\r\n    remarkable manner, as represented. In the Labrador duck the\r\n    premaxillaries are rather broader than in the wild duck; and in two\r\n    skulls of this breed the vertical ridges on each side of the\r\n    supra-occipital bone are very prominent. In the Penguin the\r\n    premaxillaries are relatively shorter than in the wild duck; and the\r\n    inferior points of the paramastoids more prominent. In a Dutch tufted\r\n    duck, the skull under the enormous tuft was slightly more globular and\r\n    was perforated by two large apertures; in this skull the lachrymal\r\n    bones were produced much further backwards, so as to have a different\r\n    shape and to nearly touch the post. lat. processes of the frontal\r\n    bones, thus almost completing the bony orbit of the eye. As the\r\n    quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex shape and stand in\r\n    relation with so many other bones, I carefully compared them in all the\r\n    principal breeds; but excepting in size they presented no difference.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Cervical Vertebræ, of natural size. A. Eighth\r\n    cervical vertebra of Wild Duck, viewed on hæmal surface. B. Eighth\r\n    cervical vertebra of Call Duck, viewed as above. C. Twelfth cervical\r\n    vertebra of Wild Duck, viewed laterally. D. Twelfth cervical vertebra\r\n    of Aylesbury Duck, viewed laterally.]\r\n\r\n    _Vertebræ and Ribs._--In one skeleton of the Labrador duck there were\r\n    the usual fifteen cervical vertebræ and the usual nine dorsal vertebræ\r\n    bearing ribs; in the other skeleton there were fifteen cervical and ten\r\n    dorsal vertebræ with ribs; nor, as far as could be judged, was this\r\n    owing merely to a rib having been developed on the first lumbar\r\n    vertebra; for in both skeletons the lumbar vertebræ agreed perfectly in\r\n    number, shape, and size with those of the wild duck. In two skeletons\r\n    of the Call-duck there were fifteen cervical and nine dorsal vertebræ;\r\n    in a third skeleton small ribs were attached to the so-called fifteenth\r\n    cervical vertebra, making ten pairs of ribs; but these ten ribs do not\r\n    correspond, or arise from the same vertebræ, with the ten in the\r\n    above-mentioned Labrador duck. In the Call-duck, which had small ribs\r\n    attached to the fifteenth cervical vertebra, the hæmal spines of the\r\n    thirteenth and fourteenth (cervical) and of the seventeenth (dorsal)\r\n    vertebræ corresponded with the spines on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and\r\n    eighteenth vertebræ of the wild duck: so that each of these vertebræ\r\n    had acquired a structure proper to one posterior to it in position. In\r\n    the twelfth cervical vertebra of this same Call-duck (fig. 40, B), the\r\n    two branches of the hæmal spine stand much closer together than in the\r\n    wild duck (A), and the descending hæmal processes are much shortened.\r\n    In the Penguin duck the neck from its thinness and erectness falsely\r\n    appears (as ascertained by measurement) to be much elongated, but the\r\n    cervical and dorsal vertebræ present no difference; the posterior\r\n    dorsal vertebræ, however, are more completely anchylosed to {284} the\r\n    pelvis than in the wild duck. The Aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical\r\n    and ten dorsal vertebræ furnished with ribs, but the same number of\r\n    lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebræ, as far as could be traced, as in\r\n    the wild duck. The cervical vertebræ in this same duck (fig. 40, D)\r\n    were much broader and thicker relatively to their length than in the\r\n    wild (C); so much so, that I have thought it worth while to give a\r\n    sketch of the eighth cervical vertebra in these two birds. From the\r\n    foregoing statements we see that the fifteenth cervical vertebra\r\n    occasionally becomes modified into a dorsal vertebra, and when this\r\n    occurs all the adjoining vertebræ are modified. We also see that an\r\n    additional dorsal vertebra bearing a rib is occasionally developed, the\r\n    number of the cervical and lumbar vertebræ apparently remaining the\r\n    same as usual.\r\n\r\n    I examined the bony enlargement of the trachea in the males of the\r\n    Penguin, Call, Hook-billed, Labrador, and Aylesbury breeds; and in all\r\n    it was identical in shape.\r\n\r\n    The _Pelvis_ is remarkably uniform; but in the skeleton of the\r\n    Hook-billed duck the anterior part is much bowed inwards; in the\r\n    Aylesbury and some other breeds the ischiadic foramen is less\r\n    elongated. In the sternum, furcula, coracoids, and scapula, the\r\n    differences are so slight and so variable as not to be worth notice,\r\n    except that in two skeletons of the Penguin duck the terminal portion\r\n    of the scapula was much attenuated.\r\n\r\n    In the bones of the leg and wing no modification in shape could be\r\n    observed. But in Penguin and Hook-billed ducks, the terminal phalanges\r\n    of the wing are a little shortened. In the former, the femur and\r\n    metatarsus (but not the tibia) are considerably lengthened, relatively\r\n    to the same bones in the wild duck, and to the wing-bones in both\r\n    birds. This elongation of the leg-bones could be seen whilst the bird\r\n    was alive, and is no doubt connected with its peculiar upright manner\r\n    of walking. In a large Aylesbury duck, on the other hand, the tibia was\r\n    the only bone of the leg which relatively to the other bones was\r\n    slightly lengthened.\r\n\r\n    _On the effects of the increased and decreased Use of the Limbs._--In\r\n    all the breeds the bones of the wing (measured separately after having\r\n    been cleaned) relatively to those of the leg have become slightly\r\n    shortened, in comparison with the same bones in the wild duck, as may\r\n    be seen in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------+\r\n  |                    | Length of Femur,| Length of Humerus,|           |\r\n  |   Name of Breed.   | Tibia, and      | Radius, and       |           |\r\n  |                    | Metatarsus      | Metacarpus        | Or as     |\r\n  |                    | together.       | together.         |           |\r\n  +--------------------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------+\r\n  |                    |   Inches.       |    Inches.        |           |\r\n  |Wild mallard        |    7.14         |     9.28          | 100 : 129 |\r\n  |Aylesbury           |    8.64         |    10.43          | 100 : 120 |\r\n  |Tufted (Dutch)      |    8.25         |     9.83          | 100 : 119 |\r\n  |Penguin             |    7.12         |     8.78          | 100 : 123 |\r\n  |Call                |    6.20         |     7.77          | 100 : 125 |\r\n  +--------------------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------+\r\n  |                    | Length of same  | Length of all the |           |\r\n  |                    |     Bones.      |  Bones of Wing.   |           |\r\n  |                    +-----------------+-------------------+           |\r\n  |                    |   Inches.       |  Inches.          |           |\r\n  |Wild duck           |                 |                   |           |\r\n  |(another specimen)  |    6.85         |    10.07          | 100 : 147 |\r\n  |Common domestic duck|    8.15         |    11.26          | 100 : 138 |\r\n  +--------------------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n{285}\r\n\r\n    In the foregoing table we see that, in comparison with the wild duck,\r\n    the reduction in the length of the bones of the wing, relatively to\r\n    those of the legs, though slight, is universal.

The first of the two tables on the next page shows\r\n    that the leg-bones relatively to the weight of the entire skeleton have\r\n    really increased in weight; but the second table shows that according\r\n    to the same standard the wing-bones have also really decreased in\r\n    weight; so that the relative disproportion shown in the foregoing\r\n    tables between the wing and leg bones, in comparison with those of the\r\n    wild duck, is partly due to the increase in weight and length of the\r\n    leg-bones, and partly to the decrease in weight and length of the\r\n    wing-bones.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the two following tables, I may first state that I\r\n    tested them by taking another skeleton of a wild duck and of a common\r\n    domestic duck, and by comparing the weight of _all_ the bones of the\r\n    leg with _all_ those of the wings, and the result was the same. In the\r\n    first of these tables we see that the leg-bones in each case have\r\n    increased in actual weight. It might have been expected that, with the\r\n    increased or decreased weight of the entire skeleton, the leg-bones\r\n    would have become proportionally heavier or lighter; but their greater\r\n    weight in all the breeds relatively to the other bones can be accounted\r\n    for only by these domestic birds having used their legs in walking and\r\n    standing much more than the wild, for they never fly, and the more\r\n    artificial breeds rarely swim. In the second {286} table we see, with\r\n    the exception of one case, a plain reduction in the weight of the bones\r\n    of the wing, and this no doubt has resulted from their lessened use.\r\n    The one exceptional case, namely, in one of the Call-ducks, is in truth\r\n    no exception, for this bird was constantly in the habit of flying\r\n    about: and I have seen it day after day rise from my grounds, and fly\r\n    for a long time in circles of more than a mile in diameter. In this\r\n    Call-duck there is not only no decrease, but an actual increase in the\r\n    weight of the wing-bones relatively to those of the wild duck; and this\r\n    probably is consequent on the remarkable lightness and thinness of all\r\n    the bones of the skeleton.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+-------------------+-----------------+-----------+\r\n  |                    | Weight of entire  | Weight of       |           |\r\n  |   Name of Breed.   | Skeleton.         | Femur, Tibia,   |           |\r\n  |                    | (N.B.

The prominence of the crest of the sternum,\r\n    relatively to its length, is also much reduced in all the domestic\r\n    breeds. These changes have evidently been caused by the lessened use of\r\n    the wings.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that several birds, belonging to different Orders, and\r\ninhabiting oceanic islands, have their wings greatly reduced in size and\r\nare incapable of flight. I suggested in my 'Origin of Species' that, as\r\nthese birds are not persecuted by any enemies, the reduction of their wings\r\nhas probably been caused by gradual disuse. Hence, during the earlier\r\nstages of the {287} process of reduction, such birds might be expected to\r\nresemble in the state of their organs of flight our domesticated ducks.\r\nThis is the case with the water-hen (_Gallinula nesiotis_) of Tristan\r\nd'Acunha, which \"can flutter a little, but obviously uses its legs, and not\r\nits wings, as a mode of escape.\" Now Mr. Sclater[454] finds in this bird\r\nthat the wings, sternum, and coracoids, are all reduced in length, and the\r\ncrest of the sternum in depth, in comparison with the same bones in the\r\nEuropean water-hen (_G. chloropus_). On the other hand, the thigh-bones and\r\npelvis are increased in length, the former by four lines, relatively to the\r\nsame bones in the common water-hen. Hence in the skeleton of this natural\r\nspecies nearly the same changes have occurred, only carried a little\r\nfurther, as with our domestic ducks, and in this latter case I presume no\r\none will dispute that they have resulted from the lessened use of the wings\r\nand the increased use of the legs.\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThis bird deserves some notice, as hardly any other anciently domesticated\r\nbird or quadruped has varied so little. That geese were anciently\r\ndomesticated we know from certain verses in Homer; and from these birds\r\nhaving been kept (388 B.C.) in the Capitol at Rome as sacred to Juno, which\r\nsacredness implies great antiquity[455]. That the goose has varied in some\r\ndegree, we may infer from naturalists not being unanimous with respect to\r\nits wild parent-form; though the difficulty is chiefly due to the existence\r\nof three or four closely allied wild European species[456]. A large\r\nmajority of capable judges are convinced that our geese are descended from\r\nthe wild Grey-lag goose (_A. ferus_); the young of which can easily be\r\ntamed,[457] and are domesticated by the Laplanders. This species, when\r\ncrossed with the domestic goose, produced in the Zoological Gardens, as I\r\nwas assured in {288} 1849, perfectly fertile offspring.[458] Yarrell[459]\r\nhas observed that the lower part of the trachea of the domestic goose is\r\nsometimes flattened, and that a ring of white feathers sometimes surrounds\r\nthe base of the beak. These characters seem at first good indications of a\r\ncross at some former period with the white-fronted goose (_A. albifrons_);\r\nbut the white ring is variable in this latter species, and we must not\r\noverlook the law of analogous variation; that is, of one species assuming\r\nsome of the characters of allied species.\r\n\r\nAs the goose has proved so inflexible in its organization under\r\nlong-continued domestication, the amount of variation which can be detected\r\nis worth giving. It has increased in size and in productiveness;[460] and\r\nvaries from white to a dusky colour. Several observers[461] have stated\r\nthat the gander is more frequently white than the goose, and that when old\r\nit almost invariably becomes white; but this is not the case with the\r\nparent-form, the _A. ferus_. Here, again, the law of analogous variation\r\nmay have come into play, as the snow-white male of the Rock-Goose\r\n(_Bernicla antarctica_) standing on the sea-shore by his dusky partner is a\r\nsight well known to all those who have traversed the sounds of Tierra del\r\nFuego and the Falkland Islands. Some geese have topknots; and the skull\r\nbeneath, as before stated, is perforated. A sub-breed has lately been\r\nformed with the feathers reversed at the back of the head and neck.[462]\r\nThe beak varies a little in size, and is of a yellower tint than in the\r\nwild species; but its colour and that of the legs are both slightly\r\nvariable.[463] This latter fact deserves attention, because the colour of\r\nthe legs and beak is highly serviceable in discriminating the several\r\nclosely allied wild forms.[464] At our {289} Shows two breeds are\r\nexhibited; viz. the Embden and Toulouse; but they differ in nothing except\r\ncolour.[465] Recently a smaller and singular variety has been imported from\r\nSebastopol,[466] with the scapular feathers (as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier,\r\nwho sent me specimens) greatly elongated, curled, and even spirally\r\ntwisted. The margins of these feathers are rendered plumose by the\r\ndivergence of the barbs and barbules, so that they resemble in some degree\r\nthose on the back of the black Australian swan. These feathers are likewise\r\nremarkable from the central shaft, which is excessively thin and\r\ntransparent, being split into fine filaments, which, after running for a\r\nspace free, sometimes coalesce again. It is a curious fact that these\r\nfilaments are regularly clothed on each side with fine down or barbules,\r\nprecisely like those on the proper barbs of the feather. This structure of\r\nthe feathers is transmitted to half-bred birds. In _Gallus sonneratii_ the\r\nbarbs and barbules blend together, and form thin horny plates of the same\r\nnature with the shaft: in this variety of the goose, the shaft divides into\r\nfilaments which acquire barbules, and thus resemble true barbs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the domestic goose certainly differs somewhat from any known wild\r\nspecies, yet the amount of variation which it has undergone, as compared\r\nwith most domesticated animals, is singularly small. This fact can be\r\npartially accounted for by selection not having come largely into play.\r\nBirds of all kinds which present many distinct races are valued as pets or\r\nornaments; no one makes a pet of the goose; the name, indeed, in more\r\nlanguages than one, is a term of reproach. The goose is valued for its size\r\nand flavour, for the whiteness of its feathers which adds to their value,\r\nand for its prolificness and tameness. In all these points the goose\r\ndiffers from the wild parent-form; and these are the points which have been\r\nselected. Even in ancient times the Roman gourmands valued the liver of the\r\n_white_ goose; and Pierre Belon[467] in 1555 speaks of two varieties, one\r\nof which was larger, more fecund, and of a better colour than the other;\r\nand he expressly states that good managers {290} attended to the colour of\r\ntheir goslings, so that they might know which to preserve and select for\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nTHE PEACOCK.\r\n\r\nThis is another bird which has hardly varied under domestication, except in\r\nsometimes being white or piebald. Mr. Waterhouse carefully compared, as he\r\ninforms me, skins of the wild Indian and domestic bird, and they were\r\nidentical in every respect, except that the plumage of the latter was\r\nperhaps rather thicker. Whether our birds are descended from those\r\nintroduced into Europe in the time of Alexander, or have been subsequently\r\nimported, is doubtful. They do not breed very freely with us, and are\r\nseldom kept in large numbers,--circumstances which would greatly interfere\r\nwith the gradual selection and formation of new breeds.\r\n\r\nThere is one strange fact with respect to the peacock, namely, the\r\noccasional appearance in England of the \"japanned\" or \"black-shouldered\"\r\nkind. This form has lately been named on the high authority of Mr. Sclater\r\nas a distinct species, viz. _Pavo nigripennis_, which he believes will\r\nhereafter be found wild in some country, but not in India, where it is\r\ncertainly unknown. These japanned birds differ conspicuously from the\r\ncommon peacock in the colour of their secondary wing-feathers, scapulars,\r\nwing-coverts, and thighs; the females are much paler, and the young, as I\r\nhear from Mr. Bartlett, likewise differ. They can be propagated perfectly\r\ntrue. Although they do not resemble the hybrids which have been raised\r\nbetween _P. cristatus_ and _muticus_, nevertheless they are in some\r\nrespects intermediate in character between these two species; and this fact\r\nfavours, as Mr. Sclater believes, the view that they form a distinct and\r\nnatural species.[468]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Sir R. Heron states[469] that this breed suddenly\r\nappeared within his memory in Lord Brownlow's large stock of pied, white,\r\nand common peacocks. The same thing occurred in Sir J. Trevelyan's flock\r\ncomposed entirely of the {291} common kind, and in Mr. Thornton's stock of\r\ncommon and pied peacocks. It is remarkable that in these two latter\r\ninstances the black-shouldered kind increased, \"to the extinction of the\r\npreviously existing breed.\" I have also received through Mr. Sclater a\r\nstatement from Mr. Hudson Gurney that he reared many years ago a pair of\r\nblack-shouldered peacocks from the common kind; and another ornithologist,\r\nProf. A. Newton, states that, five or six years ago, a female bird, in all\r\nrespects similar to the female of the black-shouldered kind, was produced\r\nfrom a stock of common peacocks in his possession, which during more than\r\ntwenty years had not been crossed with birds of any other strain. Here we\r\nhave five distinct cases of japanned birds suddenly appearing in flocks of\r\nthe common kind kept in England. Better evidence of the first appearance of\r\na new variety could hardly be desired. If we reject this evidence, and\r\nbelieve that the japanned peacock is a distinct species, we must suppose in\r\nall these cases that the common breed had at some former period been\r\ncrossed with the supposed _P. nigripennis_, but had lost every trace of the\r\ncross, yet that the birds occasionally produced offspring which suddenly\r\nand completely reacquired through reversion the characters of _P.\r\nnigripennis_. I have heard of no other such case in the animal or vegetable\r\nkingdom. To perceive the full improbability of such an occurrence, we may\r\nsuppose that a breed of dogs had been crossed at some former period with a\r\nwolf, but had lost every trace of the wolf-like character, yet that the\r\nbreed gave birth in five instances in the same country, within no great\r\nlength of time, to a wolf perfect in every character; and we must further\r\nsuppose that in two of the cases the newly produced wolves afterwards\r\nspontaneously increased to such an extent as to lead to the extinction of\r\nthe parent-breed of dogs. So remarkable a form as the _P. nigripennis_,\r\nwhen first imported, would have realized a large price; it is therefore\r\nimprobable that it should have been silently introduced and its history\r\nsubsequently lost. On the whole the evidence seems to me, as it did to Sir\r\nR. Heron, to preponderate strongly in favour of the black-shouldered breed\r\nbeing a variation, induced either by the climate of England, or by some\r\nunknown cause, such as reversion to a primordial and extinct condition of\r\nthe species. On the view that the black-shouldered {292} peacock is a\r\nvariety, the case is the most remarkable ever recorded of the abrupt\r\nappearance of a new form, which so closely resembles a true species that it\r\nhas deceived one of the most experienced of living ornithologists.\r\n\r\nTHE TURKEY.\r\n\r\nIT seems fairly well established by Mr. Gould,[470] that the turkey, in\r\naccordance with the history of its first introduction, is descended from a\r\nwild Mexican species (_Meleagris Mexicana_) which had been already\r\ndomesticated by the natives before the discovery of America, and which\r\ndiffers specifically, as it is generally thought, from the common wild\r\nspecies of the United States. Some naturalists, however, think that these\r\ntwo forms should be ranked only as well-marked geographical races. However\r\nthis may be, the case deserves notice because in the United States wild\r\nmale turkeys sometimes court the domestic hens, which are descended from\r\nthe Mexican form, \"and are generally received by them with great\r\npleasure.\"[471] Several accounts have likewise been published of young\r\nbirds, reared in the United States from the eggs of the wild species,\r\ncrossing and commingling with the common breed. In England, also, this same\r\nspecies has been kept in several parks; from two of which the Rev. W. D.\r\nFox procured birds, and they crossed freely with the common domestic kind,\r\nand during many years afterwards, as he informs me, the turkeys in his\r\nneighbourhood clearly showed traces of their crossed parentage. We here\r\nhave an instance of a domestic race being modified by a cross with a\r\ndistinct species or wild race. F. Michaux[472] suspected in 1802 that the\r\ncommon domestic turkey was not descended from the United States species\r\nalone, but likewise from a southern form, and he went so far as to believe\r\nthat English and French {293} turkeys differed from having different\r\nproportions of the blood of the two parent-forms.\r\n\r\nEnglish turkeys are smaller than either wild form. They have not varied in\r\nany great degree; but there are some breeds which can be distinguished--as\r\nNorfolks, Suffolks, Whites, and Copper-coloured (or Cambridge), all of\r\nwhich, if precluded from crossing with other breeds, propagate their kind\r\ntruly. Of these kinds, the most distinct is the small, hardy, dull-black\r\nNorfolk turkey, of which the chickens are black, with occasionally white\r\npatches about the head. The other breeds scarcely differ except in colour,\r\nand their chickens are generally mottled all over with brownish-grey.[473]\r\nThe tuft of hair on the breast, which is proper to the male alone,\r\noccasionally appears on the breast of the domesticated female.[474] The\r\ninferior tail-coverts vary in number, and according to a German\r\nsuperstition the hen lays as many eggs as the cock has feathers of this\r\nkind.[475] In Holland there was formerly, according to Temminck, a\r\nbeautiful buff-yellow breed, furnished with an ample white topknot. Mr.\r\nWilmot has described[476] a white turkey-cock with a crest formed of\r\n\"feathers about four inches long, with bare quills, and a tuft of soft\r\nwhite down growing at the end.\" Many of the young birds whilst young\r\ninherited this kind of crest, but afterwards it either fell off or was\r\npecked out by the other birds. This is an interesting case, as with care a\r\nnew breed might probably have been formed; and a topknot of this nature\r\nwould have been to a certain extent analogous to that borne by the males in\r\nseveral allied genera, such as Euplocomus, Lophophorus, and Pavo.\r\n\r\nWild turkeys, believed in every instance to have been imported from the\r\nUnited States, have been kept in the parks of Lords Powis, Leicester, Hill,\r\nand Derby. The Rev. W. D. Fox procured birds from the two first-named\r\nparks, and he informs me that they certainly differed a little from each\r\nother in the shape of their bodies and in the barred plumage on their\r\nwings. These birds likewise differed from Lord Hill's stock. Some of the\r\nlatter kept at Oulton by Sir P. Egerton, though precluded from {294}\r\ncrossing with common turkeys, occasionally produced much paler-coloured\r\nbirds, and one that was almost white, but not an albino. These half-wild\r\nturkeys in thus slightly differing from each other present an analogous\r\ncase with the wild cattle kept in the several British parks. We must\r\nsuppose that the differences have resulted from the prevention of free\r\nintercrossing between birds ranging over a wide area, and from the changed\r\nconditions to which they have been exposed in England. In India the climate\r\nhas apparently wrought a still greater change in the turkey, for it is\r\ndescribed by Mr. Blyth[477] as being much degenerated in size, \"utterly\r\nincapable of rising on the wing,\" of a black colour, and \"with the long\r\npendulous appendages over the beak enormously developed.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GUINEA FOWL.\r\n\r\nThe domesticated guinea-fowl is now believed by naturalists to be descended\r\nfrom the _Numida ptilorhynca_, which inhabits very hot, and, in parts,\r\nextremely arid districts in Eastern Africa; consequently it has been\r\nexposed in this country to extremely different conditions of life.\r\nNevertheless it has hardly varied at all, except in the plumage being\r\neither paler or darker-coloured. It is a singular fact that this bird\r\nvaries more in colour in the West Indies and on the Spanish Main, under a\r\nhot though humid climate, than in Europe.[478] The guinea-fowl has become\r\nthoroughly feral in Jamaica and in St. Domingo,[479] and has diminished in\r\nsize; the legs are black, whereas the legs of the aboriginal African bird\r\nare said to be grey. This small change is worth notice on account of the\r\noften-repeated statement that all feral animals invariably revert in every\r\ncharacter to their original type.\r\n\r\n{295}\r\n\r\nTHE CANARY BIRD.\r\n\r\nAs this bird has been recently domesticated, namely, within the last 350\r\nyears, its variability deserves notice. It has been crossed with nine or\r\nten other species of Fringillidæ, and some of the hybrids are almost\r\ncompletely fertile; but we have no evidence that any distinct breed has\r\noriginated from such crosses. Notwithstanding the modern domestication of\r\nthe canary, many varieties have been produced; even before the year 1718 a\r\nlist of twenty-seven varieties was published in France,[480] and in 1779 a\r\nlong schedule of the desired qualities was printed by the London Canary\r\nSociety, so that methodical selection has been practised during a\r\nconsiderable period. The greater number of the varieties differ only in\r\ncolour and in the markings of their plumage. Some breeds, however, differ\r\nin shape, such as the hooped or bowed canaries, and the Belgian canaries\r\nwith their much elongated bodies. Mr. Brent[481] measured one of the latter\r\nand found it eight inches in length, whilst the wild canary is only five\r\nand a quarter inches long. There are topknotted canaries, and it is a\r\nsingular fact, that, if two topknotted birds are matched, the young,\r\ninstead of having very fine topknots, are generally bald, or even have a\r\nwound on their heads.[482] It would appear as if the topknot were due to\r\nsome morbid condition which is increased to an injurious degree when two\r\nbirds in this state are paired. There is a feather-footed breed, and\r\nanother with a kind of frill running down the breast. One other character\r\ndeserves notice from being confined to one period of life and from being\r\nstrictly inherited at the same period: namely, the wing and tail feathers\r\nin prize canaries being black, \"but this colour is retained only until the\r\nfirst moult; once moulted, the peculiarity ceases.\"[483] Canaries differ\r\nmuch in disposition and character, and in some small degree in song. They\r\nproduce eggs three or four times during the year.\r\n\r\n{296}\r\n\r\nGOLD-FISH.\r\n\r\nBesides mammals and birds, few animals belonging to the other great classes\r\nhave been domesticated; but to show that it is an almost universal law that\r\nanimals, when removed from their natural conditions of life, vary, and that\r\nraces can be formed when selection is applied, it is necessary to say a few\r\nwords on gold-fish, bees, and silk-moths.\r\n\r\nGold-fish (_Cyprinus auratus_) were introduced into Europe only two or\r\nthree centuries ago; but it is believed that they have been kept in\r\nconfinement from an ancient period in China. Mr. Blyth[484] suspects from\r\nthe analogous variation of other fishes that golden-coloured fish do not\r\noccur in a state of nature. These fishes frequently live under the most\r\nunnatural conditions, and their variability in colour, size, and in some\r\nimportant points of structure is very great. M. Sauvigny has described and\r\ngiven coloured drawings of no less than eighty-nine varieties.[485] Many of\r\nthe varieties, however, such as triple tail-fins, &c., ought to be called\r\nmonstrosities; but it is difficult to draw any distinct line between a\r\nvariation and a monstrosity. As gold-fish are kept for ornament or\r\ncuriosity, and as \"the Chinese are just the people to have secluded a\r\nchance variety of any kind, and to have matched and paired from it,\"[486]\r\nwe may feel nearly confident that selection has been largely practised in\r\nthe formation of new breeds. It is however a singular fact that some of the\r\nmonstrosities or variations are not inherited; for Sir R. Heron[487] kept\r\nmany of these fishes, and placed all the deformed fishes, namely those\r\ndestitute of dorsal fins, and those furnished with a double anal fin, or\r\ntriple tail, in a pond by themselves; but they did \"not produce a greater\r\nproportion of deformed offspring than the perfect fishes.\"\r\n\r\nPassing over an almost infinite diversity of colour, we meet with the most\r\nextraordinary modifications of structure. Thus, out of about two dozen\r\nspecimens bought in London, Mr. Yarrell observed some with the dorsal fin\r\nextending along more than {297} half the length of the back; others with\r\nthis fin reduced to only five or six rays; and one with no dorsal fin. The\r\nanal fins are sometimes double, and the tail is often triple. This latter\r\ndeviation of structure seems generally to occur \"at the expense of the\r\nwhole or part of some other fin;\"[488] but Bory de Saint Vincent[489] saw\r\nat Madrid gold-fish furnished with a dorsal fin and a triple tail. One\r\nvariety is characterized by a hump on its back near the head; and the Rev.\r\nL. Jenyns[490] has described a most singular variety, imported from China,\r\nalmost globular in form like a Diodon, with \"the fleshy part of the tail as\r\nif entirely cut away; the caudal fin being set on a little behind the\r\ndorsal and immediately above the anal.\" In this fish the anal and caudal\r\nfins were double; the anal fin being attached to the body in a vertical\r\nline: the eyes also were enormously large and protuberant.\r\n\r\nHIVE-BEES.\r\n\r\nBees have been domesticated from an ancient period; if indeed their state\r\ncan be considered one of domestication, for they search for their own food,\r\nwith the exception of a little generally given to them during the winter.\r\nTheir habitation is a hive instead of a hole in a tree. Bees, however, have\r\nbeen transported into almost every quarter of the world, so that climate\r\nought to have produced whatever direct effect it is capable of producing.\r\nIt is frequently asserted that the bees in different parts of Great Britain\r\ndiffer in size, colour, and temper; and Godron[491] says that they are\r\ngenerally larger in the south than in other parts of France; it has also\r\nbeen asserted that the little brown bees of High Burgundy, when transported\r\nto La Bresse, become large and yellow in the second generation. But these\r\nstatements require confirmation. As far as size is concerned, it is known\r\nthat bees produced in very old combs are smaller, owing to the cells having\r\nbecome smaller from the {298} successive old cocoons. The best\r\nauthorities[492] concur that, with the exception of the Ligurian race or\r\nspecies, presently to be mentioned, distinct breeds do not exist in Britain\r\nor on the Continent. There is, however, even in the same stock, some\r\nvariability in colour. Thus Mr. Woodbury states[493] that he has several\r\ntimes seen queen bees of the common kind annulated with yellow like\r\nLigurian queens, and the latter dark-coloured like common bees. He has also\r\nobserved variations in the colour of the drones, without any corresponding\r\ndifference in the queens or workers of the same hive. The great apiarian\r\nDzierzon, in answer to my queries on this subject, says[494] that in\r\nGermany bees of some stocks are decidedly dark, whilst others are\r\nremarkable for their yellow colour. Bees also seem to differ in habits in\r\ndifferent districts, for Dzierzon adds, \"If many stocks with their\r\noffspring are more inclined to swarm, whilst others are richer in honey, so\r\nthat some bee-keepers even distinguish between swarming and honey-gathering\r\nbees, this is a habit which has become second nature, caused by the\r\ncustomary mode of keeping the bees and the pasturage of the district. For\r\nexample; what a difference in this respect one may perceive to exist\r\nbetween the bees of the Lüneburg heath and those of this country!\"...\r\n\"Removing an old queen and substituting a young one of the current year is\r\nhere an infallible mode of keeping the strongest stock from swarming and\r\npreventing drone-breeding; whilst the same means if adopted in Hanover\r\nwould certainly be of no avail.\" I procured a hive full of dead bees from\r\nJamaica, where they have long been naturalised, and, on carefully comparing\r\nthem under the microscope with my own bees, I could detect not a trace of\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable uniformity in the hive-bee, wherever kept, may probably be\r\naccounted for by the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of bringing\r\nselection into play by pairing particular queens and drones, for these\r\ninsects unite only during {299} flight. Nor is there any record, with a\r\nsingle partial exception, of any person having separated and bred from a\r\nhive in which the workers presented some appreciable difference. In order\r\nto form a new breed, seclusion from other bees would, as we now know, be\r\nindispensable; for since the introduction of the Ligurian bee into Germany\r\nand England, it has been found that the drones wander at least two miles\r\nfrom their own hives, and often cross with the queens of the common\r\nbee.[495] The Ligurian bee, although perfectly fertile when crossed with\r\nthe common kind, is ranked by most naturalists as a distinct species,\r\nwhilst by others it is ranked as a natural variety: but this form need not\r\nhere be noticed, as there is no reason to believe that it is the product of\r\ndomestication. The Egyptian and some other bees are likewise ranked by Dr.\r\nGerstäcker,[496] but not by other highly competent judges, as geographical\r\nraces; and he grounds his conclusion in chief part on the fact that in\r\ncertain districts, as in the Crimea and Rhodes, the hive-bee varies so much\r\nin colour, that the several geographical races can be closely connected by\r\nintermediate forms.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to a single instance of the separation and preservation of a\r\nparticular stock of bees. Mr. Lowe[497] procured some bees from a cottager\r\na few miles from Edinburgh, and perceived that they differed from the\r\ncommon bee in the hairs on the head and thorax being lighter coloured and\r\nmore profuse in quantity. From the date of the introduction of the Ligurian\r\nbee into Great Britain we may feel sure that these bees had not been\r\ncrossed with this form. Mr. Lowe propagated this variety, but unfortunately\r\ndid not separate the stock from his other bees, and after three generations\r\nthe new character was almost completely lost. Nevertheless, as he adds, \"a\r\ngreat number of the bees still retain traces, though faint, of the original\r\ncolony.\" This case shows us what could probably be effected by careful and\r\nlong-continued selection applied exclusively to the workers, for, as we\r\nhave seen, queens and drones cannot be selected and paired.\r\n\r\n{300}\r\n\r\nSILK-MOTHS.\r\n\r\nThese insects are in several respects interesting to us, more especially\r\nbecause they have varied largely at early periods of life, and the\r\nvariations have been inherited at corresponding periods. As the value of\r\nthe silk-moth depends entirely on the cocoon, every change in its structure\r\nand qualities has been carefully attended to, and races differing much in\r\nthe cocoon, but hardly at all in the adult state, have been produced. With\r\nthe races of most other domestic animals, the young resemble each other\r\nclosely, whilst the adults differ much.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless, even if it were possible, to describe all the many\r\nkinds of silk-worms. Several distinct species exist in India and China\r\nwhich produce useful silk, and some of these are capable of freely crossing\r\nwith the common silk-moth, as has been recently ascertained in France.\r\nCaptain Hutton[498] states that throughout the world at least six species\r\nhave been domesticated; and he believes that the silk-moths reared in\r\nEurope belong to two or three species. This, however, is not the opinion of\r\nseveral capable judges who have particularly attended to the cultivation of\r\nthis insect in France; and hardly accords with some facts presently to be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe common silk-moth (_Bombyx mori_) was brought to Constantinople in the\r\nsixth century, whence it was carried into Italy, and in 1494 into\r\nFrance.[499] Everything has been favourable for the variation of this\r\ninsect. It is believed to have been domesticated in China as long ago as\r\n2700 B.C. It has been kept under unnatural and diversified conditions of\r\nlife, and has been transported into many countries. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that the nature of the food given to the caterpillar influences to\r\na certain extent the character of the breed.[500] Disuse has apparently\r\naided in checking the development of the wings. But the most important\r\nelement in the production of the many now existing, much modified races, no\r\ndoubt has {301} been the close attention which has long been applied in\r\nmany countries to every promising variation. The care taken in Europe in\r\nthe selection of the best cocoons and moths for breeding is notorious,[501]\r\nand the production of eggs is followed as a distinct trade in parts of\r\nFrance. I have made inquiries through Dr. Falconer, and am assured that in\r\nIndia the natives are equally careful in the process of selection. In China\r\nthe production of eggs is confined to certain favourable districts, and the\r\nraisers are precluded by law from producing silk, so that their whole\r\nattention may be necessarily given up to this one object.[502]\r\n\r\n    The following details on the differences between the several breeds are\r\n    taken, when not stated to the contrary, from M. Robinet's excellent\r\n    work,[503] which bears every sign of care and large experience. The\r\n    _eggs_ in the different races vary in colour, in shape (being round,\r\n    elliptic, or oval), and in size. The eggs laid in June in the south of\r\n    France, and in July in the central provinces, do not hatch until the\r\n    following spring; and it is in vain, says M. Robinet, to expose them to\r\n    a temperature gradually raised, in order that the caterpillar may be\r\n    quickly developed. Yet occasionally, without any known cause, batches\r\n    of eggs are produced, which immediately begin to undergo the proper\r\n    changes, and are hatched in from twenty to thirty days. From these and\r\n    some other analogous facts it may be concluded that the Trevoltini\r\n    silkworms of Italy, of which the caterpillars are hatched in from\r\n    fifteen to twenty days, do not necessarily form, as has been\r\n    maintained, a distinct species. Although the breeds which live in\r\n    temperate countries produce eggs which cannot be immediately hatched by\r\n    artificial heat, yet when they are removed to and reared in a hot\r\n    country they gradually acquire the character of quick development, as\r\n    in the Trevoltini races.[504]\r\n\r\n    _Caterpillars._--These vary greatly in size and colour. The skin is\r\n    generally white, sometimes mottled with black or grey, and occasionally\r\n    quite black. The colour, however, as M. Robinet asserts, is not\r\n    constant, even in perfectly pure breeds; except in the _race tigrée_,\r\n    so called from being marked with transverse black stripes. As the\r\n    general colour of the caterpillar is not correlated with that of the\r\n    silk,[505] this character is disregarded {302} by cultivators, and has\r\n    not been fixed by selection. Captain Hutton, in the paper before\r\n    referred to, has argued with much force that the dark tiger-like marks,\r\n    which so frequently appear during the later moults in the caterpillars\r\n    of various breeds, are due to reversion; for the caterpillars of\r\n    several allied wild species of Bombyx are marked and coloured in this\r\n    manner. He separated some caterpillars with the tiger-like marks, and\r\n    in the succeeding spring (pp. 149, 298) nearly all the caterpillars\r\n    reared from them were dark-brindled, and the tints became still darker\r\n    in the third generation. The moths reared from these caterpillars[506]\r\n    also became darker, and resembled in colouring the wild _B. Huttoni_.\r\n    On this view of the tiger-like marks being due to reversion, the\r\n    persistency with which they are transmitted is intelligible.\r\n\r\n    Several years ago Mrs. Whitby took great pains in breeding silkworms on\r\n    a large scale, and she informed me that some of her caterpillars had\r\n    dark eyebrows. This is probably the first step in reversion towards the\r\n    tiger-like marks, and I was curious to know whether so trifling a\r\n    character would be inherited; at my request she separated in 1848\r\n    twenty of these caterpillars, and having kept the moths separate, bred\r\n    from them. Of the many caterpillars thus reared, \"every one without\r\n    exception had eyebrows, some darker and more decidedly marked than the\r\n    others, but _all_ had eyebrows more or less plainly visible.\" Black\r\n    caterpillars occasionally appear amongst those of the common kind, but\r\n    in so variable a manner, that according to M. Robinet the same race\r\n    will one year exclusively produce white caterpillars, and the next year\r\n    many black ones; nevertheless, I have been informed by M. A. Bossi of\r\n    Geneva, that, if these black caterpillars are separately bred from,\r\n    they reproduce the same colour; but the cocoons and moths reared from\r\n    them do not present any difference.\r\n\r\n    The caterpillar in Europe ordinarily moults four times before passing\r\n    into the cocoon stage; but there are races \"à trois mues,\" and the\r\n    Trevoltini race likewise moults only thrice. It might have been thought\r\n    that so important a physiological difference would not have arisen\r\n    under domestication; but M. Robinet[507] states that, on the one hand,\r\n    ordinary caterpillars occasionally spin their cocoons after only three\r\n    moults, and, on the other hand, \"presque toutes les races à trois mues,\r\n    que nous avons expérimentées, ont fait quatre mues à la seconde ou à la\r\n    troisième année, ce qui semble prouver qu'il a suffi de les placer dans\r\n    des conditions favorables pour leur rendre une faculté qu'elles avaient\r\n    perdue sous des influences moins favorables.\"\r\n\r\n    _Cocoons._--The caterpillar in changing into the cocoon loses about 50\r\n    per cent. of its weight; but the amount of loss differs in different\r\n    breeds, and this is of importance to the cultivator. The cocoon in the\r\n    different races presents characteristic differences; being large or\r\n    small;--nearly spherical with no constriction, as in the _Race de\r\n    Loriol_, or cylindrical with either a deep or slight constriction in\r\n    the middle;--with the two ends, or with one end alone, more or less\r\n    pointed. The silk varies in fineness and quality, and in being nearly\r\n    white, of two tints, or yellow. Generally the colour of {303} the silk\r\n    is not strictly inherited: but in the chapter on Selection I shall give\r\n    a curious account how, in the course of sixty-five generations, the\r\n    number of yellow cocoons in one breed has been reduced in France from\r\n    one hundred to thirty-five in the thousand. According to Robinet, the\r\n    white race, called Sina, by careful selection during the last\r\n    seventy-five years, \"est arrivée à un tel état de pureté, qu'on ne voit\r\n    pas un seul cocon jaune dans des millions de cocons blancs.\"[508]\r\n    Cocoons are sometimes formed, as is well known, entirely destitute of\r\n    silk, which yet produce moths; unfortunately Mrs. Whitby was prevented\r\n    by an accident from ascertaining whether this character would prove\r\n    hereditary.\r\n\r\n    _Adult stage._--I can find no account of any constant difference in the\r\n    moths of the most distinct races. Mrs. Whitby assured me that there was\r\n    none in the several kinds bred by her; and I have received a similar\r\n    statement from the eminent naturalist M. de Quatrefages. Captain Hutton\r\n    also says[509] that the moths of all kinds vary much in colour, but in\r\n    nearly the same inconstant manner. Considering how much the cocoons in\r\n    the several races differ, this fact is of interest, and may probably be\r\n    accounted for on the same principle as the fluctuating variability of\r\n    colour in the caterpillar, namely, that there has been no motive for\r\n    selecting and perpetuating any particular variation.\r\n\r\n    The males of the wild Bombycidæ \"fly swiftly in the day-time and\r\n    evening, but the females are usually very sluggish and inactive.\"[510]\r\n    In several moths of this family the females have abortive wings, but no\r\n    instance is known of the males being incapable of flight, for in this\r\n    case the species could hardly have been perpetuated. In the silk-moth\r\n    both sexes have imperfect, crumpled wings, and are incapable of flight;\r\n    but still there is a trace of the characteristic difference in the two\r\n    sexes; for though, on comparing a number of males and-females, I could\r\n    detect no difference in the development of their wings, yet I was\r\n    assured by Mrs. Whitby that the males of the moths bred by her used\r\n    their wings more than the females, and could flutter downwards, though\r\n    never upwards. She also states that, when the females first emerge from\r\n    the cocoon, their wings are less expanded than those of the male. The\r\n    degree of imperfection, however, in the wings varies much in different\r\n    races and under different circumstances; M. Quatrefages[511] says that\r\n    he has seen a number of moths with their wings reduced to a third,\r\n    fourth, or tenth part of their normal dimensions, and even to mere\r\n    short straight stumps: \"il me semble qu'il y a là un véritable arrêt de\r\n    développement partiel.\" On the other hand, he describes the female\r\n    moths of the André Jean breed as having \"leurs ailes larges et étalées.\r\n    Un seul présente quelques courbures irrégulières et des plis anomaux.\"\r\n    As moths and butterflies of all kinds reared from wild caterpillars\r\n    under confinement often have crippled wings, the same cause, whatever\r\n    it may be, has probably acted on {304} silk-moths, but the disuse of\r\n    their wings during so many generations has, it may be suspected,\r\n    likewise come into play.\r\n\r\n    The moths of many breeds fail to glue their eggs to the surface on\r\n    which they are laid,[512] but this proceeds, according to Capt.\r\n    Hutton,[513] merely from the glands of the ovipositor being weakened.\r\n\r\n    As with other long-domesticated animals, the instincts of the silk-moth\r\n    have suffered. The caterpillars, when placed on a mulberry-tree, often\r\n    commit the strange mistake of devouring the base of the leaf on which\r\n    they are feeding, and consequently fall down; but they are capable,\r\n    according to M. Robinet,[514] of again crawling up the trunk. Even this\r\n    capacity sometimes fails, for M. Martins[515] placed some caterpillars\r\n    on a tree, and those which fell were not able to remount and perished\r\n    of hunger; they were even incapable of passing from leaf to leaf.\r\n\r\n    Some of the modifications which the silk-moth has undergone stand in\r\n    correlation with each other. Thus the eggs of the moths which produce\r\n    white cocoons and of those which produce yellow cocoons differ slightly\r\n    in tint. The abdominal feet also of the caterpillars which yield white\r\n    cocoons are always white, whilst those which give yellow cocoons are\r\n    invariably yellow.[516] We have seen that the caterpillars with dark\r\n    tiger-like stripes produce moths which are more darkly shaded than\r\n    other moths. It seems well established[517] that in France the\r\n    caterpillars of the races which produce white silk, and certain black\r\n    caterpillars, have resisted, better than other races, the disease which\r\n    has recently devastated the silk-districts. Lastly, the races differ\r\n    constitutionally, for some do not succeed so well under a temperate\r\n    climate as others; and a damp soil does not equally injure all the\r\n    races.[518]\r\n\r\nFrom these various facts we learn that silk-moths, like the higher animals,\r\nvary greatly under long-continued domestication. We learn also the more\r\nimportant fact that variations may occur at various periods of life, and be\r\ninherited at corresponding periods. And finally we see that insects are\r\namenable to the great principle of Selection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{305}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATED PLANTS: CEREAL AND CULINARY PLANTS.\r\n\r\n    PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE NUMBER AND PARENTAGE OF CULTIVATED\r\n    PLANTS--FIRST STEPS IN CULTIVATION--GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF\r\n    CULTIVATED PLANTS.\r\n\r\n    CEREALIA.--DOUBTS ON THE NUMBER OF SPECIES.--WHEAT: VARIETIES\r\n    OF--INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY--CHANGED HABITS--SELECTION--ANCIENT HISTORY\r\n    OF THE VARIETIES.--MAIZE: GREAT VARIATION OF--DIRECT ACTION OF CLIMATE\r\n    ON.\r\n\r\n    CULINARY PLANTS.--CABBAGES: VARIETIES OF, IN FOLIAGE AND STEMS, BUT NOT\r\n    IN OTHER PARTS--PARENTAGE OF--OTHER SPECIES OF BRASSICA.--PEAS: AMOUNT\r\n    OF DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERAL KINDS, CHIEFLY IN THE PODS AND SEED--SOME\r\n    VARIETIES CONSTANT, SOME HIGHLY VARIABLE--DO NOT\r\n    INTERCROSS.--BEANS.--POTATOES: NUMEROUS VARIETIES OF--DIFFERING LITTLE,\r\n    EXCEPT IN THE TUBERS--CHARACTERS INHERITED.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into so much detail on the variability of cultivated\r\nplants, as in the case of domesticated animals. The subject is involved in\r\nmuch difficulty. Botanists have generally neglected cultivated varieties,\r\nas beneath their notice. In several cases the wild prototype is unknown or\r\ndoubtfully known; and in other cases it is hardly possible to distinguish\r\nbetween escaped seedlings and truly wild plants, so that there is no safe\r\nstandard of comparison by which to judge of any supposed amount of change.\r\nNot a few botanists believe that several of our anciently cultivated plants\r\nhave become so profoundly modified that it is not possible now to recognise\r\ntheir aboriginal parent-forms. Equally perplexing are the doubts whether\r\nsome of them are descended from one species, or from several inextricably\r\ncommingled by crossing and variation. Variations often pass into, and\r\ncannot be distinguished from, monstrosities; and monstrosities are of\r\nlittle significance for our purpose. Many varieties are propagated solely\r\nby grafts, buds, layers, bulbs, &c., and frequently it is not known how far\r\ntheir peculiarities can be transmitted by seminal generation. Nevertheless\r\nsome facts of value can be gleaned; and other facts will hereafter be {306}\r\nincidentally given. One chief object in the two following chapters is to\r\nshow how generally almost every character in our cultivated plants has\r\nbecome variable.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on details a few general remarks on the origin of\r\ncultivated plants may be introduced. M. Alph. de Candolle[519] in an\r\nadmirable discussion on this subject, in which he displays a wonderful\r\namount of knowledge, gives a list of 157 of the most useful cultivated\r\nplants. Of these he believes that 85 are almost certainly known in their\r\nwild state; but on this head other competent judges[520] entertain great\r\ndoubts. Of 40 of them, the origin is admitted by M. De Candolle to be\r\ndoubtful, either from a certain amount of dissimilarity which they present\r\nwhen compared with their nearest allies in a wild state, or from the\r\nprobability of the latter not being truly wild plants, but seedlings\r\nescaped from culture. Of the entire 157, 32 alone are ranked by M. De\r\nCandolle as quite unknown in their aboriginal condition. But it should be\r\nobserved that he does not include in his list several plants which present\r\nill-defined characters, namely, the various forms of pumpkins, millet,\r\nsorghum, kidney-bean, dolichos, capsicum, and indigo. Nor does he include\r\nflowers; and several of the more anciently cultivated flowers, such as\r\ncertain roses, the common Imperial lily, the tuberose, and even the lilac,\r\nare said[521] not to be known in the wild state.\r\n\r\nFrom the relative numbers above given, and from other arguments of much\r\nweight, M. De Candolle concludes that plants have rarely been so much\r\nmodified by culture that they cannot be identified with their wild\r\nprototypes. But on this view, considering that savages probably would not\r\nhave chosen rare plants for cultivation, that useful plants are generally\r\nconspicuous, and that they could not have been the inhabitants of deserts\r\nor of remote and recently discovered islands, it appears strange to me that\r\nso many of our cultivated plants should be still unknown or only doubtfully\r\nknown in the wild state. If, on the other hand, many of these plants have\r\nbeen profoundly modified by culture, the difficulty disappears. Their {307}\r\nextermination during the progress of civilisation would likewise remove the\r\ndifficulty; but M. De Candolle has shown that this probably has seldom\r\noccurred. As soon as a plant became cultivated in any country, the\r\nhalf-civilised inhabitants would no longer have need to search the whole\r\nsurface of the land for it, and thus lead to its extirpation; and even if\r\nthis did occur during a famine, dormant seeds would be left in the ground.\r\nIn tropical countries the wild luxuriance of nature, as was long ago\r\nremarked by Humboldt, overpowers the feeble efforts of man. In anciently\r\ncivilised temperate countries, where the whole face of the land has been\r\ngreatly changed, it can hardly be doubted that some plants have been\r\nexterminated; nevertheless De Candolle has shown that all the plants\r\nhistorically known to have been first cultivated in Europe still exist here\r\nin the wild state.\r\n\r\nMM. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps [522] and De Candolle have remarked that our\r\ncultivated plants, more especially the cereals, must originally have\r\nexisted in nearly their present state; for otherwise they would not have\r\nbeen noticed and valued as objects of food. But these authors apparently\r\nhave not considered the many accounts given by travellers of the wretched\r\nfood collected by savages. I have read an account of the savages of\r\nAustralia cooking, during a dearth, many vegetables in various ways, in the\r\nhopes of rendering them innocuous and more nutritious. Dr. Hooker found the\r\nhalf-starved inhabitants of a village in Sikhim suffering greatly from\r\nhaving eaten arum-roots,[523] which they had pounded and left for several\r\ndays to ferment, so as partially to destroy their poisonous nature; and he\r\nadds that they cooked and ate many other deleterious plants. Sir Andrew\r\nSmith informs me that in South Africa a large number of fruits and\r\nsucculent leaves, and especially roots, are used in times of scarcity. The\r\nnatives, indeed, know the properties of a long catalogue of plants, some\r\nhaving {308} been found during famines to be eatable, others injurious to\r\nhealth, or even destructive to life. He met a party of Baquanas who, having\r\nbeen expelled by the conquering Zulus, had lived for years on any roots or\r\nleaves which afforded some little nutriment, and distended their stomachs,\r\nso as to relieve the pangs of hunger. They looked like walking skeletons,\r\nand suffered fearfully from constipation. Sir Andrew Smith also informs me\r\nthat on such occasions the natives observe as a guide for themselves, what\r\nthe wild animals, especially baboons and monkeys, eat.\r\n\r\nFrom innumerable experiments made through dire necessity by the savages of\r\nevery land, with the results handed down by tradition, the nutritious,\r\nstimulating, and medicinal properties of the most unpromising plants were\r\nprobably first discovered. It appears, for instance, at first an\r\ninexplicable fact that untutored man, in three distant quarters of the\r\nworld, should have discovered amongst a host of native plants that the\r\nleaves of the tea-plant and mattee, and the berries of the coffee, all\r\nincluded a stimulating and nutritious essence, now known to be chemically\r\nthe same. We can also see that savages suffering from severe constipation\r\nwould naturally observe whether any of the roots which they devoured acted\r\nas aperients. We probably owe our knowledge of the uses of almost all\r\nplants to man having originally existed in a barbarous state, and having\r\nbeen often compelled by severe want to try as food almost everything which\r\nhe could chew and swallow.\r\n\r\nFrom what we know of the habits of savages in many quarters of the world,\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that our cereal plants originally existed in\r\ntheir present state so valuable to man. Let us look to one continent alone,\r\nnamely, Africa: Barth[524] states that the slaves over a large part of the\r\ncentral region regularly collect the seeds of a wild grass, the _Pennisetum\r\ndistichum_; in another district he saw women collecting the seeds of a Poa\r\nby swinging a sort of basket through the rich meadow-land. Near Tete\r\nLivingstone observed the natives collecting the seeds {309} of a wild\r\ngrass; and farther south, as Andersson informs me, the natives largely use\r\nthe seeds of a grass of about the size of canary-seed, which they boil in\r\nwater. They eat also the roots of certain reeds, and every one has read of\r\nthe Bushmen prowling about and digging up with a fire-hardened stake\r\nvarious roots. Similar facts with respect to the collection of seeds of\r\nwild grasses in other parts of the world could be given.[525]\r\n\r\nAccustomed as we are to our excellent vegetables and luscious fruits, we\r\ncan hardly persuade ourselves that the stringy roots of the wild carrot and\r\nparsnip, or the little shoots of the wild asparagus, or crabs, sloes, &c.,\r\nshould ever have been valued; yet, from what we know of the habits of\r\nAustralian and South African savages, we need feel no doubt on this head.\r\nThe inhabitants of Switzerland during the Stone-period largely collected\r\nwild crabs, sloes, bullaces, hips of roses, elderberries, beech-mast, and\r\nother wild berries and fruit.[526] Jemmy Button, a Fuegian on board the\r\n_Beagle_, remarked to me that the poor and acid black-currants of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego were too sweet for his taste.\r\n\r\nThe savage inhabitants of each land, having found out by many and hard\r\ntrials what plants were useful, or could be rendered useful by various\r\ncooking processes, would after a time take the first step in cultivation by\r\nplanting them near their usual abodes. Livingstone[527] states that the\r\nsavage Batokas sometimes left wild fruit-trees standing in their gardens,\r\nand occasionally even planted them, \"a practice seen nowhere else amongst\r\nthe natives.\" But Du Chaillu saw a palm and some other wild fruit-trees\r\nwhich had been planted; and these trees were considered private property.\r\nThe next step in cultivation, and this would require but little\r\nforethought, would be to sow {310} the seeds of useful plants; and as the\r\nsoil near the hovels of the natives[528] would often be in some degree\r\nmanured, improved varieties would sooner or later arise. Or a wild and\r\nunusually good variety of a native plant might attract the attention of\r\nsome wise old savage; and he would transplant it, or sow its seed. That\r\nsuperior varieties of wild fruit-trees occasionally are found is certain,\r\nas in the case of the American species of hawthorns, plums, cherries,\r\ngrapes, and hickories, specified by Professor Asa Gray.[529] Downing also\r\nrefers to certain wild varieties of the hickory, as being \"of much larger\r\nsize and finer flavour than the common species.\" I have referred to\r\nAmerican fruit-trees, because we are not in this case troubled with doubts\r\nwhether or not the varieties are seedlings which have escaped from\r\ncultivation. Transplanting any superior variety, or sowing its seeds,\r\nhardly implies more forethought than might be expected at an early and rude\r\nperiod of civilisation. Even the Australian barbarians \"have a law that no\r\nplant bearing seeds is to be dug up after it has flowered;\" and Sir G.\r\nGrey[530] never saw this law, evidently framed for the preservation of the\r\nplant, violated. We see the same spirit in the superstitious belief of the\r\nFuegians, that killing water-fowl whilst very young will be followed by\r\n\"much rain, snow, blow much.\"[531] I may add, as showing forethought in the\r\nlowest barbarians, that the Fuegians when they find a stranded whale bury\r\nlarge portions in the sand, and during the often-recurrent famines travel\r\nfrom great distances for the remnants of the half-putrid mass.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked[532] that we do not owe a single useful plant to\r\nAustralia or the Cape of Good Hope,--countries abounding to an unparalleled\r\ndegree with endemic species,--or to New Zealand, or to America south of the\r\nPlata; and, according to some authors, not to America northward of Mexico.\r\nI do not believe that any edible or valuable plant, except the {311}\r\ncanary-grass, has been derived from an oceanic or uninhabited island. If\r\nnearly all our useful plants, natives of Europe, Asia, and South America,\r\nhad originally existed in their present condition, the complete absence of\r\nsimilarly useful plants in the great countries just named would indeed be a\r\nsurprising fact. But if these plants have been so greatly modified and\r\nimproved by culture as no longer closely to resemble any natural species,\r\nwe can understand why the above-named countries have given us no useful\r\nplants, for they were either inhabited by men who did not cultivate the\r\nground at all, as in Australia and the Cape of Good Hope, or who cultivated\r\nit very imperfectly, as in some parts of America. These countries do yield\r\nplants which are useful to savage man; and Dr. Hooker[533] enumerates no\r\nless than 107 such species in Australia alone; but these plants have not\r\nbeen improved, and consequently cannot compete with those which have been\r\ncultivated and improved during thousands of years in the civilised world.\r\n\r\nThe case of New Zealand, to which fine island we as yet owe no widely\r\ncultivated plant, may seem opposed to this view; for, when first\r\ndiscovered, the natives cultivated several plants; but all inquirers\r\nbelieve, in accordance with the traditions of the natives, that the early\r\nPolynesian colonists brought with them seeds and roots, as well as the dog,\r\nwhich had all been wisely preserved during their long voyage. The\r\nPolynesians are so frequently lost on the ocean, that this degree of\r\nprudence would occur to any wandering party: hence the early colonists of\r\nNew Zealand, like the later European colonists, would not have had any\r\nstrong inducement to cultivate the aboriginal plants. According to De\r\nCandolle we owe thirty-three useful plants to Mexico, Peru, and Chile; nor\r\nis this surprising when we remember the civilized state of the inhabitants,\r\nas shown by the fact of their having practised artificial irrigation and\r\nmade tunnels through hard rocks without the use of iron or gunpowder, and\r\nwho, as we shall see in a future chapter, fully recognised, as far as\r\nanimals were concerned, and therefore probably in the case of plants, the\r\nimportant principle of selection. We owe some plants to Brazil; and the\r\nearly voyagers, namely Vespucius and Cabral, describe the country as\r\nthickly peopled {312} and cultivated. In North America[534] the natives\r\ncultivated maize, pumpkins, gourds, beans, and peas, \"all different from\r\nours,\" and tobacco; and we are hardly justified in assuming that none of\r\nour present plants are descended from these North American forms. Had North\r\nAmerica been civilized for as long a period, and as thickly peopled, as\r\nAsia or Europe, it is probable that the native vines, walnuts, mulberries,\r\ncrabs, and plums, would have given rise, after a long course of\r\ncultivation, to a multitude of varieties, some extremely different from\r\ntheir parent-stocks; and escaped seedlings would have caused in the New, as\r\nin the Old World, much perplexity with respect to their specific\r\ndistinctness and parentage.[535]\r\n\r\n    _Cerealia._--I will now enter on details. The cereals cultivated in\r\n    Europe consist of four genera--wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Of wheat\r\n    the best modern authorities[536] make four or five, or even seven\r\n    distinct species; of rye, one; of barley, three; and of oats, two,\r\n    three, or four species. So that altogether our cereals are ranked by\r\n    different authors under from ten to fifteen distinct species. These\r\n    have given rise to a multitude of varieties. It is a remarkable fact\r\n    that botanists are not universally agreed on the aboriginal parent-form\r\n    of any one cereal plant. For instance, a high authority writes in\r\n    1855,[537] \"We ourselves have no hesitation in stating our conviction,\r\n    as the result of all the most reliable evidence, that none of these\r\n    Cerealia exist, or have existed, truly wild in their present state, but\r\n    that all are cultivated varieties of species now growing in great\r\n    abundance in S. Europe or W. Asia.\" On the other hand, Alph. De\r\n    Candolle[538] has adduced abundant evidence that common wheat\r\n    (_Triticum vulgare_) has been found wild in various parts of Asia,\r\n    where it is not likely to have escaped from cultivation; and there is\r\n    {313} force in M. Godron's remark, that, supposing these plants to be\r\n    escaped seedlings,[539] if they have propagated themselves in a wild\r\n    state for several generations, their continued resemblance to\r\n    cultivated wheat renders it probable that the latter has retained its\r\n    aboriginal character. M. De Candolle insists strongly on the frequent\r\n    occurrence in the Austrian dominions of rye and of one kind of oats in\r\n    an apparently wild condition. With the exception of these two cases,\r\n    which however are rather doubtful, and with the exception of two forms\r\n    of wheat and one of barley, which he believes to have been found truly\r\n    wild, M. De Candolle does not seem fully satisfied with the other\r\n    reported discoveries of the parent-forms of our other cereals. With\r\n    respect to oats, according to Mr. Buckman,[540] the wild English _Avena\r\n    fatua_ can be converted by a few years of careful cultivation and\r\n    selection into forms almost identical with two very distinct cultivated\r\n    races. The whole subject of the origin and specific distinctness of the\r\n    various cereal plants is a most difficult one; but we shall perhaps be\r\n    able to judge a little better after considering the amount of variation\r\n    which wheat has undergone.\r\n\r\n    Metzger describes seven species of wheat, Godron refers to five, and De\r\n    Candolle to only four. It is not improbable that, besides the kinds\r\n    known in Europe, other strongly characterised forms exist in the more\r\n    distant parts of the world; for Loiseleur-Deslongchamps[541] speaks of\r\n    three new species or varieties, sent to Europe in 1822 from Chinese\r\n    Mongolia, which he considers as being there indigenous. Moorcroft[542]\r\n    also speaks of Hasora wheat in Ladakh as very peculiar. If those\r\n    botanists are right who believe that at least seven species of wheat\r\n    originally existed, then the amount of variation in any important\r\n    character which wheat has undergone under cultivation has been slight;\r\n    but if only four or a lesser number of species originally existed, then\r\n    it is evident that varieties so strongly marked have arisen, that they\r\n    have been considered by capable judges as specifically distinct. But\r\n    the impossibility of deciding which forms ought to be ranked as species\r\n    and which as varieties, makes it useless to specify in detail the\r\n    differences between the various kinds of wheat. Speaking generally, the\r\n    organs of vegetation differ little;[543] but some kinds grow close and\r\n    upright, whilst others spread and trail along the ground. The straw\r\n    differs in being more or less hollow, and in quality. The ears[544]\r\n    {314} differ in colour and in shape, being quadrangular, compressed, or\r\n    nearly cylindrical; and the florets differ in their approximation to\r\n    each other, in their pubescence, and in being more or less elongated.\r\n    The presence or absence of barbs is a conspicuous difference, and in\r\n    certain Gramineæ serves even as a generic character;[545] although, as\r\n    remarked by Godron,[546] the presence of barbs is variable in certain\r\n    wild grasses, and especially in those, such as _Bromus secalinus_ and\r\n    _Lolium temulentum_, which habitually grow mingled with our cereal\r\n    crops, and which have thus unintentionally been exposed to culture. The\r\n    grains differ in size, weight, and colour; in being more or less downy\r\n    at one end, in being smooth or wrinkled, in being either nearly\r\n    globular, oval, or elongated; and finally in internal texture, being\r\n    tender or hard, or even almost horny, and in the proportion of gluten\r\n    which they contain.\r\n\r\n    Nearly all the races or species of wheat vary, as Godron[547] has\r\n    remarked, in an exactly parallel manner,--in the seed being downy or\r\n    glabrous, and in colour,--and in the florets being barbed or not\r\n    barbed, &c. Those who believe that all the kinds are descended from a\r\n    single wild species may account for this parallel variation by the\r\n    inheritance of a similar constitution, and a consequent tendency to\r\n    vary in the same manner; and those who believe in the general theory of\r\n    descent with modification may extend this view to the several species\r\n    of wheat, if such ever existed in a state of nature.\r\n\r\n    Although few of the varieties of wheat present any conspicuous\r\n    difference, their number is great. Dalbret cultivated during thirty\r\n    years from 150 to 160 kinds, and excepting in the quality of the grain\r\n    they all kept true: Colonel Le Couteur possessed upwards of 150, and\r\n    Philippar 322 varieties.[548] As wheat is an annual, we thus see how\r\n    strictly many trifling differences in character are inherited through\r\n    many generations. Colonel Le Couteur insists strongly on this same\r\n    fact: in his persevering and successful attempts to raise new varieties\r\n    by selection, he began by choosing the best ears, but soon found that\r\n    the grains in the same ear differed so that he was compelled to select\r\n    them separately; and each grain generally transmitted its own\r\n    character. The great amount of variability in the plants of the same\r\n    variety is another interesting point, which would never have been\r\n    detected except by an eye long practised to the work; thus Colonel Le\r\n    Couteur relates[549] that in a field of his own wheat, which he\r\n    considered at least as pure as that of any of his neighbours, Professor\r\n    La Gasca found twenty-three sorts; and Professor Henslow has observed\r\n    similar facts. Besides such individual variations, forms sufficiently\r\n    well marked to be valued and to become widely cultivated {315}\r\n    sometimes suddenly appear: thus Mr. Sheriff has had the good fortune to\r\n    raise in his lifetime seven new varieties, which are now extensively\r\n    grown in many parts of Britain.[550]\r\n\r\n    As in the case of many other plants, some varieties, both old and new,\r\n    are far more constant in character than others. Colonel Le Couteur was\r\n    forced to reject some of his new sub-varieties, which he suspected had\r\n    been produced from a cross, as incorrigibly sportive. With respect to\r\n    the tendency to vary, Metzger[551] gives from his own experience some\r\n    interesting facts: he describes three Spanish sub-varieties, more\r\n    especially one known to be constant in Spain, which in Germany assumed\r\n    their proper character only during hot summers; another variety kept\r\n    true only in good land, but after having been cultivated for\r\n    twenty-five years became more constant. He mentions two other\r\n    sub-varieties which were at first inconstant, but subsequently became,\r\n    apparently without any selection, accustomed to their new homes, and\r\n    retained their proper character. These facts show what small changes in\r\n    the conditions of life cause variability, and they further show that a\r\n    variety may become habituated to new conditions. One is at first\r\n    inclined to conclude with Loiseleur-Deslongchamps, that wheat\r\n    cultivated in the same country is exposed to remarkably uniform\r\n    conditions; but manures differ, seed is taken from one soil to another,\r\n    and what is far more important the plants are exposed as little as\r\n    possible to struggle with other plants, and are thus enabled to exist\r\n    under diversified conditions. In a state of nature each plant is\r\n    confined to that particular station and kind of nutriment which it can\r\n    seize from the other plants by which it is surrounded.\r\n\r\n    Wheat quickly assumes new habits of life. The summer and winter kinds\r\n    were classed by Linnæus as distinct species; but M. Monnier[552] has\r\n    proved that the difference between them is only temporary. He sowed\r\n    winter-wheat in spring, and out of one hundred plants four alone\r\n    produced ripe seeds; these were sown and resown, and in three years\r\n    plants were reared which ripened all their seed. Conversely, nearly all\r\n    the plants raised from summer-wheat, which was sown in autumn, perished\r\n    from frost; but a few were saved and produced seed, and in three years\r\n    this summer-variety was converted into a winter-variety. Hence it is\r\n    not surprising that wheat soon becomes to a certain extent\r\n    acclimatised, and that seed brought from distant countries and sown in\r\n    Europe vegetates at first, or even for a considerable period,[553]\r\n    differently from our European varieties. In Canada the first settlers,\r\n    according to Kalm,[554] found their winters too severe for winter-wheat\r\n    brought from France, and their summers often too short for\r\n    summer-wheat; and until they procured summer-wheat from the northern\r\n    parts of Europe, which succeeded well, they thought that their {316}\r\n    country was useless for corn crops. It is notorious that the proportion\r\n    of gluten differs much under different climates. The weight of the\r\n    grain is also quickly affected by climate: Loiseleur-Deslongchamps[555]\r\n    sowed near Paris 54 varieties, obtained from the South of France and\r\n    from the Black Sea, and 52 of these yielded seed from 10 to 40 per\r\n    cent. heavier than the parent-seed. He then sent these heavier grains\r\n    back to the South of France, but there they immediately yielded lighter\r\n    seed.\r\n\r\n    All those who have closely attended to the subject insist on the close\r\n    adaptation of numerous varieties of wheat to various soils and climates\r\n    even within the same country; thus Colonel Le Couteur[556] says, \"It is\r\n    the suitableness of each sort to each soil that will enable the farmer\r\n    to pay his rent by sowing one variety, where he would be unable to do\r\n    so by attempting to grow another of a seemingly better sort.\" This may\r\n    be in part due to each kind becoming habituated to its conditions of\r\n    life, as Metzger has shown certainly occurs, but it is probably in main\r\n    part due to innate differences between the several varieties.\r\n\r\n    Much has been written on the deterioration of wheat; that the quality\r\n    of the flour, size of grain, time of flowering, and hardiness may be\r\n    modified by climate and soil, seems nearly certain; but that the whole\r\n    body of any one sub-variety ever becomes changed into another and\r\n    distinct sub-variety, there is no reason to believe. What apparently\r\n    does take place, according to Le Couteur,[557] is, that some one\r\n    sub-variety out of the many which may always be detected in the same\r\n    field is more prolific than the others, and gradually supplants the\r\n    variety which was first sown.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the natural crossing of distinct varieties the evidence\r\n    is conflicting, but preponderates against its frequent occurrence. Many\r\n    authors maintain that impregnation takes place in the closed flower,\r\n    but I am sure from my own observations that this is not the case, at\r\n    least with those varieties to which I have attended. But as I shall\r\n    have to discuss this subject in another work, it may be here passed\r\n    over.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, all authors admit that numerous varieties of wheat have\r\narisen; but their differences are unimportant, unless, indeed, some of the\r\nso-called species are ranked as varieties. Those who believe that from four\r\nto seven wild species of Triticum originally existed in nearly the same\r\ncondition as at present, rest their belief chiefly on the great antiquity\r\nof the several forms.[558] It is an important fact, which we have recently\r\nlearnt from the admirable researches {317} of Heer,[559] that the\r\ninhabitants of Switzerland, even so early as the Neolithic period,\r\ncultivated no less than ten cereal plants, namely, five kinds of wheat, of\r\nwhich at least four are commonly looked at as distinct species, three kinds\r\nof barley, a panicum, and a setaria. If it could be shown that at the\r\nearliest dawn of agriculture five kinds of wheat and three of barley had\r\nbeen cultivated, we should of course be compelled to look at these forms as\r\ndistinct species. But, as Heer has remarked, agriculture even at the period\r\nof the lake-habitations had already made considerable progress; for,\r\nbesides the ten cereals, peas, poppies, flax, and apparently apples, were\r\ncultivated. It may also be inferred, from one variety of wheat being the\r\nso-called Egyptian, and from what is known of the native country of the\r\npanicum and setaria, as well as from the nature of the weeds which then\r\ngrew mingled with the crops, that the lake-inhabitants either still kept up\r\ncommercial intercourse with some southern people or had originally\r\nproceeded as colonists from the South.\r\n\r\nLoiseleur-Deslongchamps[560] has argued that, if our cereal plants had been\r\ngreatly modified by cultivation, the weeds which habitually grow mingled\r\nwith them would have been equally modified. But this argument shows how\r\ncompletely the principle of selection has been overlooked. That such weeds\r\nhave not varied, or at least do not vary now in any extreme degree, is the\r\nopinion of Mr. H. C. Watson and Professor Asa Gray, as they inform me; but\r\nwho will pretend to say that they do not vary as much as the individual\r\nplants of the same sub-variety of wheat? We have already seen that pure\r\nvarieties of wheat, cultivated in the same field, offer many slight\r\nvariations, which can be selected and separately propagated; and that\r\noccasionally more strongly pronounced variations appear, which, as Mr.\r\nSheriff has proved, are well worthy of extensive cultivation. Not until\r\nequal attention be paid to the variability and selection of weeds, can the\r\nargument from their constancy under unintentional culture be of any value.\r\nIn accordance with the principles of selection we can understand how it is\r\nthat in the several cultivated varieties of wheat the organs of vegetation\r\ndiffer so little; for if a plant {318} with peculiar leaves appeared, it\r\nwould be neglected unless the grains of corn were at the same time superior\r\nin quality or size. The selection of seed-corn was strongly\r\nrecommended[561] in ancient times by Columella and Celsus; and as Virgil\r\nsays,--\r\n\r\n \"I've seen the largest seeds, tho' view'd with care,\r\n  Degenerate, unless th' industrious hand\r\n  Did yearly cull the largest.\"\r\n\r\nBut whether in ancient times selection was methodically pursued we may well\r\ndoubt, when we hear how laborious the work was found by Le Couteur.\r\nAlthough the principle of selection is so important, yet the little which\r\nman has effected, by incessant efforts[562] during thousands of years, in\r\nrendering the plants more productive or the grains more nutritious than\r\nthey were in the time of the old Egyptians, would seem to speak strongly\r\nagainst its efficacy. But we must not forget that at each successive period\r\nthe state of agriculture and the quantity of manure supplied to the land\r\nwill have determined the maximum degree of productiveness; for it would be\r\nimpossible to cultivate a highly productive variety, unless the land\r\ncontained a sufficient supply of the necessary chemical elements.\r\n\r\nWe now know that man was sufficiently civilized to cultivate the ground at\r\nan immensely remote period; so that wheat might have been improved long ago\r\nup to that standard of excellence which was possible under the then\r\nexisting state of agriculture. One small class of facts supports this view\r\nof the slow and gradual improvement of our cereals. In the most ancient\r\nlake-habitations of Switzerland, when men employed only flint-tools, the\r\nmost extensively cultivated wheat was a peculiar kind, with remarkably\r\nsmall ears and grains.[563] \"Whilst the grains of the modern forms are in\r\nsection from seven to eight millimètres in length, the larger grains from\r\nthe lake-habitations are six, seldom seven, and the smaller ones only four.\r\nThe ear is thus much narrower, and the spikelets stand out more\r\nhorizontally, than in our present forms.\" So again with barley, the most\r\nancient and most extensively cultivated kind had small ears, and the grains\r\n{319} were \"smaller, shorter, and nearer to each other, than in that now\r\ngrown; without the husk they were 2½ lines long, and scarcely 1½ broad,\r\nwhilst those now grown have a length of three lines, and almost the same in\r\nbreadth.\"[564] These small-grained varieties of wheat and barley are\r\nbelieved by Heer to be the parent-forms of certain existing allied\r\nvarieties, which have supplanted their early progenitors.\r\n\r\nHeer gives an interesting account of the first appearance and final\r\ndisappearance of the several plants which were cultivated in greater or\r\nless abundance in Switzerland during former successive periods, and which\r\ngenerally differed more or less from our existing varieties. The peculiar\r\nsmall-eared and small-grained wheat, already alluded to, was the commonest\r\nkind during the Stone period; it lasted down to the Helvetico-Roman age,\r\nand then became extinct. A second kind was rare at first, but afterwards\r\nbecame more frequent. A third, the Egyptian wheat (_T. turgidum_), does not\r\nagree exactly with any existing variety, and was rare during the Stone\r\nperiod. A fourth kind (_T. dicoccum_) differs from all known varieties of\r\nthis form. A fifth kind (_T. monococcum_) is known to have existed during\r\nthe Stone period only by the presence of a single ear. A sixth kind, the\r\ncommon _T. spelta_, was not introduced into Switzerland until the Bronze\r\nage. Of barley, besides the short-eared and small-grained kind, two others\r\nwere cultivated, one of which was very scarce, and resembled our present\r\ncommon _H. distichum_. During the Bronze age rye and oats were introduced;\r\nthe oat-grains being somewhat smaller than those produced by our existing\r\nvarieties. The poppy was largely cultivated during the Stone period,\r\nprobably for its oil; but the variety which then existed is not now known.\r\nA peculiar pea with small seeds lasted from the Stone to the Bronze age,\r\nand then became extinct; whilst a peculiar bean, likewise having small\r\nseeds, came in at the Bronze period and lasted to the time of the Romans.\r\nThese details sound like the description given by a palæontologist of the\r\nmutations in form, of the first appearance, the increasing rarity, and\r\nfinal extinction of fossil species, embedded in the successive stages of a\r\ngeological formation.\r\n\r\n{320}\r\n\r\nFinally, every one must judge for himself whether it is more probable that\r\nthe several forms of wheat, barley, rye, and oats are descended from\r\nbetween ten and fifteen species, most of which are now either unknown or\r\nextinct, or whether they are descended from between four and eight species,\r\nwhich may have either closely resembled our present cultivated forms, or\r\nhave been so widely different as to escape identification. In this latter\r\ncase, we must conclude that man cultivated the cereals at an enormously\r\nremote period, and that he formerly practised some degree of selection,\r\nwhich in itself is not improbable. We may, perhaps, further believe that,\r\nwhen wheat was first cultivated, the ears and grains increased quickly in\r\nsize, in the same manner as the roots of the wild carrot and parsnip are\r\nknown to increase quickly in bulk under cultivation.\r\n\r\n    _Maize: Zea Mays._--Botanists are nearly unanimous that all the\r\n    cultivated kinds belong to the same species. It is undoubtedly[565] of\r\n    American origin, and was grown by the aborigines throughout the\r\n    continent from New England to Chili. Its cultivation must have been\r\n    extremely ancient, for Tschudi[566] describes two kinds, now extinct or\r\n    not known in Peru, which were taken from tombs apparently prior to the\r\n    dynasty of the Incas. But there is even stronger evidence of antiquity,\r\n    for I found on the coast of Peru[567] heads of maize, together with\r\n    eighteen species of recent sea-shell, embedded in a beach which had\r\n    been upraised at least 85 feet above the level of the sea. In\r\n    accordance with this ancient cultivation, numerous American varieties\r\n    have arisen. The aboriginal form has not as yet been discovered in the\r\n    wild state. A peculiar kind,[568] in which the grains, instead of being\r\n    naked, are concealed by husks as much as eleven lines in length, has\r\n    been stated on insufficient evidence to grow wild in Brazil. It is\r\n    almost certain that the aboriginal form would have had its grains thus\r\n    protected;[569] but the seeds of the Brazilian variety produce, as I\r\n    hear from Professor Asa Gray, and as is stated in two published\r\n    accounts, either common or husked maize; and it is not {321} credible\r\n    that a wild species, when first cultivated, should vary so quickly and\r\n    in so great a degree.\r\n\r\n    Maize has varied in an extraordinary and conspicuous manner.\r\n    Metzger,[570] who paid particular attention to the cultivation of this\r\n    plant, makes twelve races (unter-art) with numerous sub-varieties; of\r\n    the latter some are tolerably constant, others quite inconstant. The\r\n    different races vary in height from 15-18 feet to only 16-18 inches, as\r\n    in a dwarf variety described by Bonafous. The whole ear is variable in\r\n    shape, being long and narrow, or short and thick, or branched. The ear\r\n    in one variety is more than four times as long as in a dwarf kind. The\r\n    seeds are arranged in the ear in from six to even twenty rows, or are\r\n    placed irregularly. The seeds are coloured--white, pale-yellow, orange,\r\n    red, violet, or elegantly streaked with black;[571] and in the same ear\r\n    there are sometimes seeds of two colours. In a small collection I found\r\n    that a single grain of one variety nearly equalled in weight seven\r\n    grains of another variety. The shape of the seed varies greatly, being\r\n    very flat, or nearly globular, or oval; broader than long, or longer\r\n    than broad; without any point, or produced into a sharp tooth, and this\r\n    tooth is sometimes recurved. One variety (the rugosa of Bonafous) has\r\n    its seeds curiously wrinkled, giving to the whole ear a singular\r\n    appearance. Another variety (the cymosa of Bon.) carries its ears so\r\n    crowded together that it is called _maïs à bouquet_. The seeds of some\r\n    varieties contain much glucose instead of starch. Male flowers\r\n    sometimes appear amongst the female flowers, and Mr. J. Scott has\r\n    lately observed the rarer case of female flowers on a true male\r\n    panicle, and likewise hermaphrodite flowers.[572] Azara describes[573]\r\n    a variety in Paraguay the grains of which are very tender, and he\r\n    states that several varieties are fitted for being cooked in various\r\n    ways. The varieties also differ greatly in precocity, and have\r\n    different powers of resisting dryness and the action of violent\r\n    wind.[574] Some of the foregoing differences would certainly be\r\n    considered of specific value with plants in a state of nature.\r\n\r\n    Le Comte Ré states that the grains of all the varieties which he\r\n    cultivated ultimately assumed a yellow colour. But Bonafous[575] found\r\n    that most of those which he sowed for ten consecutive years kept true\r\n    to their proper tints; and he adds that in the valleys of the Pyrenees\r\n    and on the plains of Piedmont a white maize has been cultivated for\r\n    more than a century, and has undergone no change.\r\n\r\n    The tall kinds grown in southern latitudes, and therefore exposed to\r\n    great heat, require from six to seven months to ripen their seed;\r\n    whereas the dwarf kinds, grown in northern and colder climates, require\r\n    only from {322} three to four months.[576] Peter Kalm,[577] who\r\n    particularly attended to this plant, says, that in the United States,\r\n    in proceeding from south to north, the plants steadily diminish in\r\n    bulk. Seeds brought from lat. 37° in Virginia, and sown in lat. 43°-44°\r\n    in New England, produce plants which will not ripen their seed, or\r\n    ripen them with the utmost difficulty. So it is with seed carried from\r\n    New England to lat. 45°-47° in Canada. By taking great care at first,\r\n    the southern kinds after some years' culture ripen their seed perfectly\r\n    in their northern homes, so that this is an analogous case with that of\r\n    the conversion of summer into winter wheat, and conversely. When tall\r\n    and dwarf maize are planted together, the dwarf kinds are in full\r\n    flower before the others have produced a single flower; and in\r\n    Pennsylvania they ripen their seed six weeks earlier than the tall\r\n    maize. Metzger also mentions a European maize which ripens its seed\r\n    four weeks earlier than another European kind. With these facts, so\r\n    plainly showing inherited acclimatisation, we may readily believe Kalm,\r\n    who states that in North America maize and some other plants have\r\n    gradually been cultivated further and further northward. All writers\r\n    agree that to keep the varieties of maize pure they must be planted\r\n    separately so that they shall not cross.\r\n\r\n    The effects of the climate of Europe on the American varieties is\r\n    highly remarkable. Metzger obtained seed from various parts of America,\r\n    and cultivated several kinds in Germany. I will give an abstract of the\r\n    changes observed[578] in one case, namely, with a tall kind\r\n    (Breit-korniger mays, Zea altissima) brought from the warmer parts of\r\n    America. During the first year the plants were twelve feet high, and\r\n    few seeds were perfected; the lower seeds in the ear kept true to their\r\n    proper form, but the upper seeds became slightly changed. In the second\r\n    generation the plants were from nine to ten feet in height, and ripened\r\n    their seed better; the depression on the outer side of the seed had\r\n    almost disappeared, and the original beautiful white colour had become\r\n    duskier. Some of the seeds had even become yellow, and in their now\r\n    rounded form they approached common European maize. In the third\r\n    generation nearly all resemblance to the original and very distinct\r\n    American parent-form was lost. In the sixth generation this maize\r\n    perfectly resembled a European variety, described as the second\r\n    sub-variety of the fifth race. When Metzger published his book, this\r\n    variety was still cultivated near Heidelberg, and could be\r\n    distinguished from the common kind only by a somewhat more vigorous\r\n    growth. Analogous results were obtained by the cultivation of another\r\n    American race, the \"white-tooth corn,\" in which the tooth nearly\r\n    disappeared even in the second generation. A third race, the\r\n    \"chicken-corn,\" did not undergo so great a change, but the seeds became\r\n    less polished and pellucid.\r\n\r\nThese facts afford the most remarkable instance known to me of the direct\r\nand prompt action of climate on a plant. It might {323} have been expected\r\nthat the tallness of the stem, the period of vegetation, and the ripening\r\nof the seed, would have been thus affected; but it is a much more\r\nsurprising fact that the seeds should have undergone so rapid and great a\r\nchange. As, however, flowers, with their product the seed, are formed by\r\nthe metamorphosis of the stem and leaves, any modification in these latter\r\norgans would be apt to extend, through correlation, to the organs of\r\nfructification.\r\n\r\n    _Cabbage_ (_Brassica oleracea_).--Every one knows how greatly the\r\n    various kinds of cabbage differ in appearance. In the island of Jersey,\r\n    from the effects of particular culture and of climate, a stalk has\r\n    grown to the height of sixteen feet, and \"had its spring shoots at the\r\n    top occupied by a magpie's nest:\" the woody stems are not unfrequently\r\n    from ten to twelve feet in height, and are there used as rafters[579]\r\n    and as walking-sticks. We are thus reminded that in certain countries\r\n    plants belonging to the generally herbaceous order of the Cruciferæ are\r\n    developed into trees. Every one can appreciate the difference between\r\n    green or red cabbages with great single heads; Brussel-sprouts with\r\n    numerous little heads; broccolis and cauliflowers with the greater\r\n    number of their flowers in an aborted condition, incapable of producing\r\n    seed, and borne in a dense corymb instead of an open panicle; savoys\r\n    with their blistered and wrinkled leaves; and borecoles and kales,\r\n    which come nearest to the wild parent-form. There are also various\r\n    frizzled and laciniated kinds, some of such beautiful colours that\r\n    Vilmorin in his Catalogue of 1851 enumerates ten varieties, valued\r\n    solely for ornament, which are propagated by seed. Some kinds are less\r\n    commonly known, such as the Portuguese Couve Tronchuda, with the ribs\r\n    of its leaves greatly thickened; and the Kohlrabi or choux-raves, with\r\n    their stems enlarged into great turnip-like masses above the ground;\r\n    and the recently formed new race[580] of choux-raves, already including\r\n    nine sub-varieties, in which the enlarged part lies beneath the ground\r\n    like a turnip.\r\n\r\n    Although we see such great differences in the shape, size, colour,\r\n    arrangement, and manner of growth of the leaves and stem, and of the\r\n    flower-stems in the broccoli and cauliflower, it is remarkable that the\r\n    flowers themselves, the seed-pods, and seeds, present extremely slight\r\n    differences or none at all.[581] I compared the flowers of all the\r\n    principal kinds; those of the Couve Tronchuda are white and rather\r\n    smaller than in common cabbages; those of the Portsmouth broccoli have\r\n    narrower sepals, and smaller, less elongated petals; and in no other\r\n    cabbage could any difference be detected. With respect to the\r\n    seed-pods, in the purple Kohlrabi alone, {324} do they differ, being a\r\n    little longer and narrower than usual. I made a collection of the seeds\r\n    of twenty-eight different kinds, and most of them were\r\n    undistinguishable; when there was any difference it was excessively\r\n    slight; thus, the seeds of various broccolis and cauliflowers, when\r\n    seen in mass, are a little redder; those of the early green Ulm savoy\r\n    are rather smaller; and those of the Breda kail slightly larger than\r\n    usual, but not larger than the seeds of the wild cabbage from the coast\r\n    of Wales. What a contrast in the amount of difference is presented if,\r\n    on the one hand, we compare the leaves and stems of the various kinds\r\n    of cabbage with their flowers, pods, and seeds, and on the other hand\r\n    the corresponding parts in the varieties of maize and wheat! The\r\n    explanation is obvious; the seeds alone are valued in our cereals, and\r\n    their variations have been selected; whereas the seeds, seed-pods, and\r\n    flowers have been utterly neglected in the cabbage, whilst many useful\r\n    variations in their leaves and stems have been noticed and preserved\r\n    from an extremely remote period, for cabbages were cultivated by the\r\n    old Celts.[582]\r\n\r\n    It would be useless to give a classified description[583] of the\r\n    numerous races, sub-races, and varieties of the cabbage; but it may be\r\n    mentioned that Dr. Lindley has lately proposed[584] a system founded on\r\n    the state of development of the terminal and lateral leaf-buds, and of\r\n    the flower-buds. Thus, I. All the leaf-buds active and open, as in the\r\n    wild-cabbage, kail, &c. II. All the leaf-buds active, but forming\r\n    heads, as in Brussel-sprouts, &c. III. Terminal leaf-bud alone active,\r\n    forming a head as in common cabbages, savoys, &c. IV. Terminal leaf-bud\r\n    alone active and open, with most of the flowers abortive and succulent,\r\n    as in the cauliflower and broccoli. V. All the leaf-buds active and\r\n    open, with most of the flowers abortive and succulent, as in the\r\n    sprouting-broccoli. This latter variety is a new one, and bears the\r\n    same relation to common broccoli, as Brussel-sprouts do to common\r\n    cabbages; it suddenly appeared in a bed of common broccoli, and was\r\n    found faithfully to transmit its newly-acquired and remarkable\r\n    characters.\r\n\r\n    The principal kinds of cabbage existed at least as early as the\r\n    sixteenth century,[585] so that numerous modifications of structure\r\n    have been inherited for a long period. This fact is the more remarkable\r\n    as great care must be taken to prevent the crossing of the different\r\n    kinds. To give one proof of this: I raised 233 seedlings from cabbages\r\n    of different kinds, which had purposely been planted near each other,\r\n    and of the seedlings no less than 155 were plainly deteriorated and\r\n    mongrelized; nor were the remaining 78 all perfectly true. It may be\r\n    doubted whether many permanent varieties have been formed by\r\n    intentional or accidental crosses; for such crossed plants are found to\r\n    be very inconstant. One kind, however, called \"Cottager's Kale,\" has\r\n    lately been produced by crossing common kale and Brussel-sprouts,\r\n    recrossed with purple broccoli,[586] and is said to be true, but plants\r\n    {325} raised by me were not nearly so constant in character as any\r\n    common cabbage.\r\n\r\n    Although most of the kinds keep true if carefully preserved from\r\n    crossing, yet the seed-beds must be yearly examined, and a few\r\n    seedlings are generally found false; but even in this case the force of\r\n    inheritance is shown, for, as Metzger has remarked[587] when speaking\r\n    of Brussel-sprouts, the variations generally keep to their \"unter art,\"\r\n    or main race. But in order that any kind may be truly propagated there\r\n    must be no great change in the conditions of life; thus cabbages will\r\n    not form heads in hot countries, and the same thing has been observed\r\n    with an English variety grown during an extremely warm and damp autumn\r\n    near Paris.[588] Extremely poor soil also affects the characters of\r\n    certain varieties.\r\n\r\n    Most authors believe that all the races are descended from the wild\r\n    cabbage found on the western shores of Europe; but Alph. De\r\n    Candolle[589] forcibly argues on historical and other grounds that it\r\n    is more probable that two or three closely allied forms, generally\r\n    ranked as distinct species, still living in the Mediterranean region,\r\n    are the parents, now all commingled together, of the various cultivated\r\n    kinds. In the same manner as we have often seen with domesticated\r\n    animals, the supposed multiple origin of the cabbage throws no light on\r\n    the characteristic differences between the cultivated forms. If our\r\n    cabbages are the descendants of three or four distinct species, every\r\n    trace of any sterility which may originally have existed between them\r\n    is now lost, for none of the varieties can be kept distinct without\r\n    scrupulous care to prevent intercrossing.\r\n\r\n    The other cultivated forms of the genus Brassica are descended,\r\n    according to the view adopted by Godron and Metzger,[590] from two\r\n    species, _B. napus_ and _rapa_; but according to other botanists from\r\n    three species; whilst others again strongly suspect that all these\r\n    forms, both wild and cultivated, ought to be ranked as a single\r\n    species. _Brassica napus_ has given rise to two large groups, namely,\r\n    Swedish turnips (by some believed to be of hybrid origin)[591] and\r\n    Colzas, the seeds of which yield oil. _Brassica rapa_ (of Koch) has\r\n    also given rise to two races, namely, common turnips and the oil-giving\r\n    rape. The evidence is unusually clear that these latter plants, though\r\n    so different in external appearance, belong to the same species; for\r\n    the turnip has been observed by Koch and Godron to lose its thick roots\r\n    in uncultivated soil, and when rape and turnips are sown together they\r\n    cross to such a degree that scarcely a single plant comes true.[592]\r\n    Metzger by culture converted the biennial or winter rape into the\r\n    annual or summer rape,--varieties which have been thought by some\r\n    authors to be specifically distinct.[593]\r\n\r\n    In the production of large, fleshy, turnip-like stems, we have a case\r\n    {326} of analogous variation in three forms which are generally\r\n    considered as distinct species. But scarcely any modification seems so\r\n    easily acquired as a succulent enlargement of the stem or root--that is\r\n    a store of nutriment laid up for the plant's own future use. We see\r\n    this in our radishes, beet, and in the less generally known\r\n    \"turnip-rooted\" celery, and in the finocchio or Italian variety of the\r\n    common fennel. Mr. Buckman has lately proved by his interesting\r\n    experiments how quickly the roots of the wild parsnip can be enlarged,\r\n    as Vilmorin formerly proved in the case of the carrot.[594] This latter\r\n    plant, in its cultivated state, differs in scarcely any character from\r\n    the wild English species, except in general luxuriance and in the size\r\n    and quality of its roots; but in the root ten varieties, differing in\r\n    colour, shape, and quality, are cultivated[595] in England, and come\r\n    true by seed. Hence, with the carrot, as in so many other cases, for\r\n    instance with the numerous varieties and sub-varieties of the radish,\r\n    that part of the plant which is valued by man, falsely appears alone to\r\n    have varied. The truth is that variations in this part alone have been\r\n    selected; and the seedlings inheriting a tendency to vary in the same\r\n    way, analogous modifications have been again and again selected, until\r\n    at last a great amount of change has been effected.\r\n\r\n    _Pea_ (_Pisum sativum_).--Most botanists look at the garden-pea as\r\n    specifically distinct from the field-pea (_P. arvense_). The latter\r\n    exists in a wild state in Southern Europe; but the aboriginal parent of\r\n    the garden-pea has been found by one collector alone, as he states, in\r\n    the Crimea.[596] Andrew Knight crossed, as I am informed by the Rev. A.\r\n    Fitch, the field-pea with a well-known garden variety, the Prussian\r\n    pea, and the cross seems to have been perfectly fertile. Dr. Alefeld\r\n    has recently studied[597] the genus with care, and, after having\r\n    cultivated about fifty varieties, concludes that they all certainly\r\n    belong to the same species. It is an interesting fact already alluded\r\n    to, that, according to O. Heer,[598] the peas found in the\r\n    lake-habitations of Switzerland of the Stone and Bronze ages, belong to\r\n    an extinct variety, with exceedingly small seeds, allied to _P.\r\n    arvense_, or field-pea. The varieties of the common garden-pea are\r\n    numerous, and differ considerably from each other. For comparison I\r\n    planted at the same time forty-one English and French varieties, and in\r\n    this one case I will describe minutely their differences. The varieties\r\n    {327} differ greatly in height,--namely from between 6 and 12 inches to\r\n    8 feet,[599]--in manner of growth, and in period of maturity. Some\r\n    varieties differ in general aspect even while only two or three inches\r\n    in height. The stems of the _Prussian_ pea are much branched. The tall\r\n    kinds have larger leaves than the dwarf kinds, but not in strict\r\n    proportion to their height:--_Hairs' Dwarf Monmouth_ has very large\r\n    leaves, and the _Pois nain hatif_, and the moderately tall _Blue\r\n    Prussian_, have leaves about two-thirds of the size of the tallest\r\n    kind. In the _Danecroft_ the leaflets are rather small and a little\r\n    pointed; in the _Queen of Dwarfs_ rather rounded; and in the _Queen of\r\n    England_ broad and large. In these three peas the slight differences in\r\n    the shape of the leaves are accompanied by slight differences in\r\n    colour. In the _Pois géant sans parchemin_, which bears purple flowers,\r\n    the leaflets in the young plant are edged with red; and in all the peas\r\n    with purple flowers the stipules are marked with red.\r\n\r\n    In the different varieties, one or two, or several flowers in a small\r\n    cluster, are borne on the same peduncle; and this is a difference which\r\n    with some of the Leguminosæ is considered of specific value. In all the\r\n    varieties the flowers closely resemble each other except in colour and\r\n    size. They are generally white, sometimes purple, but the colour is\r\n    inconstant even in the same variety. In _Warner's Emperor_, which is a\r\n    tall kind, the flowers are nearly double the size of those of the _Pois\r\n    nain hatif_, but _Hairs' Dwarf Monmouth_, which has large leaves,\r\n    likewise has large flowers. The calyx in the _Victoria Marrow_ is\r\n    large, and in _Bishop's Long Pod_ the sepals are rather narrow. In no\r\n    other kind is there any difference in the flower.\r\n\r\n    The pods and seeds, which with natural species afford such constant\r\n    characters, differ greatly in the cultivated varieties of the pea; and\r\n    these are the valuable, and consequently the selected parts. _Sugar\r\n    peas_, or _Pois sans parchemin_, are remarkable from their thin pods,\r\n    which, whilst young, are cooked and eaten whole; and in this group,\r\n    which, according to Mr. Gordon includes eleven sub-varieties, it is the\r\n    pod which differs most: thus _Lewis's Negro-podded pea_ has a straight,\r\n    broad, smooth, and dark-purple pod, with the husk not so thin as in the\r\n    other kinds; the pod of another variety is extremely bowed; that of the\r\n    _Pois géant_ is much pointed at the extremity; and in the variety \"_à\r\n    grands cosses_\" the peas are seen through the husk in so conspicuous a\r\n    manner that the pod, especially when dry, can hardly at first be\r\n    recognised as that of a pea.\r\n\r\n    In the ordinary varieties the pods also differ much in size;--in\r\n    colour, that of _Woodford's Green Marrow_ being bright-green when dry,\r\n    instead of pale brown, and that of the purple-podded pea being\r\n    expressed by its name;--in smoothness, that of _Danecroft_ being\r\n    remarkably glossy, whereas that of the _Ne plus ultra_ is rugged;--in\r\n    being either nearly cylindrical, or broad and flat;--in being pointed\r\n    at the end as in _Thurston's Reliance_, or much truncated as in the\r\n    _American Dwarf_. In the _Auvergne pea_ the whole end of {328} the pod\r\n    is bowed upwards. In the _Queen of the Dwarfs_ and in _Scimitar peas_\r\n    the pod is almost elliptic in shape. I here give drawings of the four\r\n    most distinct pods produced by the plants cultivated by me.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 41.--Pods and Peas. I. Queen of Dwarfs. II.\r\n    American Dwarf. III. Thurston's Reliance. IV. Pois Géant sans\r\n    parchemin. _a._ Dan O'Rourke Pea. _b._ Queen of Dwarfs Pea. _c._\r\n    Knight's Tall White Marrow. d. Lewis's Negro Pea.]\r\n\r\n    In the pea itself we have every tint between almost pure white, brown,\r\n    yellow, and intense green; in the varieties of the _sugar peas_ we have\r\n    these same tints, together with red passing through fine purple into a\r\n    dark chocolate tint. These colours are either uniform or distributed in\r\n    dots, striæ, or moss-like marks; they depend in some cases on the\r\n    colour of the cotyledons seen through the skin, and in other cases on\r\n    the outer coats of the pea itself. In the different varieties the pods\r\n    contain, according to Mr. Gordon, from eleven or twelve to only four or\r\n    five peas. The largest peas are nearly twice as much in diameter as the\r\n    smallest; and the latter are not always borne by the most dwarfed\r\n    kinds. Peas differ much in {329} shape, being smooth and spherical,\r\n    smooth and oblong, nearly oval in the _Queen of Dwarfs_, and nearly\r\n    cubical and crumpled in many of the larger kinds.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the value of the differences between the chief\r\n    varieties, it cannot be doubted that, if one of the tall _Sugar-peas_,\r\n    with purple flowers, thin-skinned pods of an extraordinary shape,\r\n    including large, dark-purple peas, grew wild by the side of the lowly\r\n    _Queen of the Dwarfs_, with white flowers, greyish-green, rounded\r\n    leaves, scimitar-like pods, containing oblong, smooth, pale-coloured\r\n    peas, which became mature at a different season; or by the side of one\r\n    of the gigantic sorts, like the _Champion of England_, with leaves of\r\n    great size, pointed pods, and large, green, crumpled, almost cubical\r\n    peas,--all three kinds would be ranked as indisputably distinct\r\n    species.\r\n\r\n    Andrew Knight[600] has observed that the varieties of peas keep very\r\n    true, because they are not crossed by insects. As far as the fact of\r\n    keeping true is concerned, I hear from Mr. Masters of Canterbury, well\r\n    known as the originator of several new kinds, that certain varieties\r\n    have remained constant for a considerable time,--for instance,\r\n    _Knight's Blue Dwarf_, which came out about the year 1820.[601] But the\r\n    greater number of varieties have a singularly short existence: thus\r\n    Loudon remarks[602] that \"sorts which were highly approved in 1821, are\r\n    now, in 1833, nowhere to be found;\" and on comparing the lists of 1833\r\n    with those of 1855, I find that nearly all the varieties have changed.\r\n    Mr. Masters informs me that the nature of the soil causes some\r\n    varieties to lose their character. As with other plants, certain\r\n    varieties can be propagated truly, whilst others show a determined\r\n    tendency to vary; thus two peas differing in shape, one round and the\r\n    other wrinkled, were found by Mr. Masters within the same pod, but the\r\n    plants raised from the wrinkled kind always evinced a strong tendency\r\n    to produce round peas. Mr. Masters also raised from a plant of another\r\n    variety four distinct sub-varieties, which bore blue and round, white\r\n    and round, blue and wrinkled, and white and wrinkled peas; and although\r\n    he sowed these four varieties separately during several successive\r\n    years, each kind always reproduced all four kinds mixed together!\r\n\r\n    With respect to the varieties not naturally intercrossing, I have\r\n    ascertained that the pea, which in this respect differs from some other\r\n    Leguminosæ, is perfectly fertile without the aid of insects. Yet I have\r\n    seen humble-bees whilst sucking the nectar depress the keel-petals, and\r\n    become so thickly dusted with pollen, that some could hardly fail to be\r\n    left on the stigma of the next flower which was visited. I have made\r\n    inquiries from several great raisers of seed-peas, and I find that but\r\n    few sow them separately; the majority take no precaution; and it is\r\n    certain, as I have myself found, that true seed may be saved during at\r\n    least several generations from distinct varieties growing close\r\n    together.[603] Under these circumstances, Mr. Fitch raised, as he\r\n    informs me, one variety for twenty {330} years, which always came true.\r\n    From the analogy of kidney-beans I should have expected[604] that\r\n    occasionally, perhaps at long intervals of time, when some slight\r\n    degree of sterility had supervened from long-continued\r\n    self-fertilisation, varieties thus growing near each other would have\r\n    crossed; and I shall give in the eleventh chapter two cases of distinct\r\n    varieties which spontaneously intercrossed, as shown (in a manner\r\n    hereafter to be explained) by the pollen of the one variety having\r\n    acted directly on the seeds of the other. Whether the incessant supply\r\n    of new varieties is partly due to such occasional and accidental\r\n    crosses, and their fleeting existence to changes of fashion; or again,\r\n    whether the varieties which arise after a long course of continued\r\n    self-fertilisation are weakly and soon perish, I cannot even\r\n    conjecture. It may, however, be noticed that several of Andrew Knight's\r\n    varieties, which have endured longer than most kinds, were raised\r\n    towards the close of the last century by artificial crosses; some of\r\n    them, I believe, were still, in 1860, vigorous; but now, in 1865, a\r\n    writer, speaking[605] of Knight's four kinds of marrows, says, they\r\n    have acquired a famous history, but their glory has departed.\r\n\r\n    With respect to Beans (_Faba vulgaris_), I will say but little. Dr.\r\n    Alefeld has given[606] short diagnostic characters of forty varieties.\r\n    Every one who has seen a collection must have been struck with the\r\n    great difference in shape, thickness, proportional length and breadth,\r\n    colour, and size which beans present. What a contrast between a Windsor\r\n    and Horse-bean! As in the case of the pea, our existing varieties were\r\n    preceded during the Bronze age in Switzerland by a peculiar and now\r\n    extinct variety producing very small beans.[607]\r\n\r\n    _Potato (Solanum tuberosum)._--There is little doubt about the\r\n    parentage of this plant; for the cultivated varieties differ extremely\r\n    little in general appearance from the wild species, which can be\r\n    recognised in its native land at the first glance.[608] The varieties\r\n    cultivated in Britain are numerous; thus Lawson[609] gives a\r\n    description of 175 kinds. I planted eighteen kinds in adjoining rows;\r\n    their stems and leaves differed but little, and in several cases there\r\n    was as great an amount of difference between the individuals of the\r\n    same variety as between the different varieties. The flowers vary in\r\n    size, and in colour between white and purple, but in no other respect,\r\n    except that in one kind the sepals were somewhat elongated. One strange\r\n    variety has been described which always produces two sorts of flowers,\r\n    the first double and sterile, the second single and fertile.[610] The\r\n    fruit or berries also differ, but only in a slight degree.[611]\r\n\r\n    {331}\r\n\r\n    The tubers, on the other hand, present a wonderful amount of diversity.\r\n    This fact accords with the principle that the valuable and selected\r\n    parts of all cultivated productions present the greatest amount of\r\n    modification. They differ much in size and shape, being globular, oval,\r\n    flattened, kidney-like, or cylindrical. One variety from Peru is\r\n    described[612] as being quite straight, and at least six inches in\r\n    length, though no thicker than a man's finger. The eyes or buds differ\r\n    in form, position, and colour. The manner in which the tubers are\r\n    arranged on the so-called roots is different; thus in the\r\n    _gurken-kartoffeln_ they form a pyramid with the apex downwards, and in\r\n    another variety they bury themselves deep in the ground. The roots\r\n    themselves run either near the surface or deep in the ground. The\r\n    tubers also differ in smoothness and colour, being externally white,\r\n    red, purple, or almost black, and internally white, yellow, or almost\r\n    black. They differ in flavour and quality, being either waxy or mealy;\r\n    in their period of maturity, and in their capacity for long\r\n    preservation.\r\n\r\n    As with many other plants which have been long propagated by bulbs,\r\n    tubers, cuttings, &c., by which means the same individual is exposed\r\n    during a length of time to diversified conditions, seedling potatoes\r\n    generally display innumerable slight differences. Several varieties,\r\n    even when propagated by tubers, are far from constant, as will be seen\r\n    in the chapter on Bud-variation. Dr. Anderson[613] procured seed from\r\n    an Irish purple potato, which grew far from any other kind, so that it\r\n    could not at least in this generation have been crossed, yet the many\r\n    seedlings varied in almost every possible respect, so that \"scarcely\r\n    two plants were exactly alike.\" Some of the plants which closely\r\n    resembled each other above ground, produced extremely dissimilar\r\n    tubers; and some tubers which externally could hardly be distinguished,\r\n    differed widely in quality when cooked. Even in this case of extreme\r\n    variability, the parent-stock had some influence on the progeny, for\r\n    the greater number of the seedlings resembled in some degree the parent\r\n    Irish potato. Kidney potatoes must be ranked amongst the most highly\r\n    cultivated and artificial races; yet their peculiarities can often be\r\n    strictly propagated by seed. A great authority, Mr. Rivers,[614] states\r\n    that \"seedlings from the ash-leaved kidney always bear a strong\r\n    resemblance to their parent. Seedlings from the fluke-kidney are still\r\n    more remarkable for their adherence to their parent-stock, for, on\r\n    closely observing a great number during two seasons, I have not been\r\n    able to observe the least difference either in earliness,\r\n    productiveness, or in the size or shape of their tubers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{332}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPLANTS _continued_--FRUITS--ORNAMENTAL TREES--FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n    FRUITS.--GRAPES--VARY IN ODD AND TRIFLING PARTICULARS.--MULBERRY.--THE\r\n    ORANGE GROUP--SINGULAR RESULTS FROM CROSSING.--PEACH AND\r\n    NECTARINE--BUD-VARIATION--ANALOGOUS VARIATION--RELATION TO THE\r\n    ALMOND.--APRICOT.--PLUMS--VARIATION IN THEIR\r\n    STONES.--CHERRIES--SINGULAR VARIETIES\r\n    OF.--APPLE.--PEAR.--STRAWBERRY--INTERBLENDING OF THE ORIGINAL\r\n    FORMS.--GOOSEBERRY--STEADY INCREASE IN SIZE OF THE FRUIT--VARIETIES\r\n    OF.--WALNUT.--NUT.--CUCURBITACEOUS PLANTS--WONDERFUL VARIATION OF.\r\n\r\n    ORNAMENTAL TREES--THEIR VARIATION IN DEGREE AND\r\n    KIND--ASH-TREE--SCOTCH-FIR--HAWTHORN.\r\n\r\n    FLOWERS--MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF MANY KINDS--VARIATION IN CONSTITUTIONAL\r\n    PECULIARITIES--KIND OF VARIATION.--ROSES--SEVERAL SPECIES\r\n    CULTIVATED.--PANSY.--DAHLIA.--HYACINTH, HISTORY AND VARIATION OF.\r\n\r\n    _The Vine_ (_Vitis vinifera_).--The best authorities consider all our\r\n    grapes as the descendants of one species which now grows wild in\r\n    western Asia, which grew during the Bronze-age wild in Italy,[615] and\r\n    which has recently been found fossil in a tufaceous deposit in the\r\n    south of France.[616] Some authors, however, entertain much doubt about\r\n    the single parentage of our cultivated varieties, owing to the number\r\n    of semi-wild forms found in Southern Europe, especially as described by\r\n    Clemente,[617] in a forest in Spain; but as the grape sows itself\r\n    freely in Southern Europe, and as several of the chief kinds transmit\r\n    their characters by seed,[618] whilst others are extremely variable,\r\n    the existence of many different escaped forms could hardly fail to\r\n    occur in countries where this plant has been cultivated from the\r\n    remotest antiquity. That the vine varies much when propagated by seed,\r\n    we may infer from the largely increased number of varieties since the\r\n    earlier historical records. New hot-house varieties are produced almost\r\n    every year; for instance,[619] a golden-coloured variety has been\r\n    recently raised in England from a black grape without the aid of a\r\n    cross. {333} Van Mons[620] reared a multitude of varieties from the\r\n    seed of one vine, which was completely separated from all others, so\r\n    that there could not, at least in this generation, have been any\r\n    crossing, and the seedlings presented \"les analogues de toutes les\r\n    sortes,\" and differed in almost every possible character both in the\r\n    fruit and foliage.\r\n\r\n    The cultivated varieties are extremely numerous; Count Odart says that\r\n    he will not deny that there may exist throughout the world 700 or 800,\r\n    perhaps even 1000 varieties, but not a third of these have any value.\r\n    In the Catalogue of fruit cultivated in the Horticultural Gardens of\r\n    London, published in 1842, 99 varieties are enumerated. Wherever the\r\n    grape is grown many varieties occur: Pallas describes 24 in the Crimea,\r\n    and Burnes mentions 10 in Cabool. The classification of the varieties\r\n    has much perplexed writers, and Count Odart is reduced to a\r\n    geographical system; but I will not enter on this subject, nor on the\r\n    many and great differences between the varieties. I will merely specify\r\n    a few curious and trifling peculiarities, all taken from Odart's highly\r\n    esteemed work,[621] for the sake of showing the diversified variability\r\n    of this plant. Simon has classed grapes into two main divisions, those\r\n    with downy leaves and those with smooth leaves, but he admits that in\r\n    one variety, namely the Rebazo, the leaves are either smooth or downy;\r\n    and Odart (p. 70) states that some varieties have the nerves alone, and\r\n    other varieties their young leaves, downy, whilst the old ones are\r\n    smooth. The Pedro-Ximenes grape (Odart, p. 397) presents a peculiarity\r\n    by which it can be at once recognised amongst a host of other\r\n    varieties, namely, that when the fruit is nearly ripe the nerves of the\r\n    leaves or even the whole surface becomes yellow. The Barbera d'Asti is\r\n    well marked by several characters (p. 426), amongst others, \"by some of\r\n    the leaves, and it is always the lowest on the branches, suddenly\r\n    becoming of a dark red colour.\" Several authors in classifying grapes\r\n    have founded their main divisions on the berries being either round or\r\n    oblong; and Odart admits the value of this character; yet there is one\r\n    variety, the Maccabeo (p. 71), which often produces small round, and\r\n    large oblong, berries in the same bunch. Certain grapes called Nebbiolo\r\n    (p. 429) present a constant character, sufficient for their\r\n    recognition, namely, \"the slight adherence of that part of the pulp\r\n    which surrounds the seeds to the rest of the berry, when cut through\r\n    transversely.\" A Rhenish variety is mentioned (p. 228) which likes a\r\n    dry soil; the fruit ripens well, but at the moment of maturity, if much\r\n    rain falls, the berries are apt to rot; on the other hand, the fruit of\r\n    a Swiss variety (p. 243) is valued for well sustaining prolonged\r\n    humidity. This latter variety sprouts late in the spring, yet matures\r\n    its fruit early; other varieties (p. 362) have the fault of being too\r\n    much excited by the April sun, and in consequence suffer from frost. A\r\n    Styrian variety (p. 254) has brittle foot-stalks, so that the clusters\r\n    of fruit are often blown off; this variety is said to be particularly\r\n    attractive to wasps and bees. Other varieties have tough stalks, which\r\n    resist the wind. Many other variable characters could be given, but the\r\n    foregoing facts are sufficient to show in how many small structural and\r\n    {334} constitutional details the vine varies. During the vine disease\r\n    in France certain whole groups of varieties[622] have suffered far more\r\n    from mildew than others. Thus \"the group of the Chasselas, so rich in\r\n    varieties, did not afford a single fortunate exception;\" certain other\r\n    groups suffered much less; the true old Burgundy, for instance, was\r\n    comparatively free from disease, and the Carminat likewise resisted the\r\n    attack. The American vines, which belong to a distinct species,\r\n    entirely escaped the disease in France; and we thus see that those\r\n    European varieties which best resist the disease must have acquired in\r\n    a slight degree the same constitutional peculiarities as the American\r\n    species.\r\n\r\n    _White Mulberry_ (_Morus alba_).--I mention this plant because it has\r\n    varied in certain characters, namely, in the texture and quality of the\r\n    leaves, fitting them to serve as food for the domesticated silkworm, in\r\n    a manner not observed with other plants; but this has arisen simply\r\n    from such variations in the mulberry having been attended to, selected,\r\n    and rendered more or less constant. M. de Quatrefages[623] briefly\r\n    describes six kinds cultivated in one valley in France: of these the\r\n    _amourouso_ produces excellent leaves, but is rapidly being abandoned\r\n    because it produces much fruit mingled with the leaves: the _antofino_\r\n    yields deeply cut leaves of the finest quality, but not in great\r\n    quantity: the _claro_ is much sought for because the leaves can be\r\n    easily collected: lastly, the _roso_ bears strong hardy leaves,\r\n    produced in large quantity, but with the one inconvenience, that they\r\n    are best adapted for the worms after their fourth moult. MM.\r\n    Jacquemet-Bonnefont, of Lyon, however, remark in their catalogue (1862)\r\n    that two sub-varieties have been confounded under the name of the\r\n    _roso,_ one having leaves too thick for the caterpillars, the other\r\n    being valuable because the leaves can easily be gathered from the\r\n    branches without the bark being torn.\r\n\r\n    In India the mulberry has also given rise to many varieties. The Indian\r\n    form is thought by many botanists to be a distinct species; but as\r\n    Royle remarks,[624] \"so many varieties have been produced by\r\n    cultivation that it is difficult to ascertain whether they all belong\r\n    to one species;\" they are, as he adds, nearly as numerous as those of\r\n    the silkworm.\r\n\r\n    _The Orange Group._--We here meet with great confusion in the specific\r\n    distinction and parentage of the several kinds. Gallesio,[625] who\r\n    almost devoted his life-time to the subject, considers that there are\r\n    four species, namely, sweet and bitter oranges, lemons, and citrons,\r\n    each of which has given rise to whole groups of varieties, monsters,\r\n    and supposed hybrids. One high authority[626] believes that these four\r\n    reputed species are all {335} varieties of the wild _Citrus medica_,\r\n    but that the shaddock (_Citrus decumana_), which is not known in a wild\r\n    state, is a distinct species; though its distinctness is doubted by\r\n    another writer \"of great authority on such matters,\" namely, Dr.\r\n    Buchanan Hamilton. Alph. De Candolle,[627] on the other hand--and there\r\n    cannot be a more capable judge--advances what he considers sufficient\r\n    evidence of the orange (he doubts whether the bitter and sweet kinds\r\n    are specifically distinct), the lemon, and citron, having been found\r\n    wild, and consequently that they are distinct. He mentions two other\r\n    forms cultivated in Japan and Java, which he ranks as undoubted\r\n    species; he speaks rather more doubtfully about the shaddock, which\r\n    varies much, and has not been found wild; and finally he considers some\r\n    forms, such as Adam's apple and the bergamotte, as probably hybrids.\r\n\r\n    I have briefly abstracted these opinions for the sake of showing those\r\n    who have never attended to such subjects, how perplexed with doubt they\r\n    are. It would, therefore, be useless for my purpose to give a sketch of\r\n    the conspicuous differences between the several forms. Besides the\r\n    ever-recurrent difficulty of determining whether forms found wild are\r\n    truly aboriginal or are escaped seedlings, many of the forms, which\r\n    must be ranked as varieties, transmit their characters almost perfectly\r\n    by seed. Sweet and bitter oranges differ in no important respect except\r\n    in the flavour of their fruit, but Gallesio[628] is most emphatic that\r\n    both kinds can be propagated by seed with absolute certainty.\r\n    Consequently, in accordance with his simple rule, he classes them as\r\n    distinct species; as he does sweet and bitter almonds, the peach and\r\n    nectarine, &c. He admits, however, that the soft-shelled pine-tree\r\n    produces not only soft-shelled but some hard-shelled seedlings, so that\r\n    a little greater force in the power of inheritance would, according to\r\n    this rule, raise the soft-shelled pine-tree into the dignity of an\r\n    aboriginally created species. The positive assertion made by\r\n    Macfayden[629] that the pips of sweet oranges produce in Jamaica,\r\n    according to the nature of the soil in which they are sown, either\r\n    sweet or bitter oranges, is probably an error; for M. Alph. De Candolle\r\n    informs me that since the publication of his great work he has received\r\n    accounts from Guiana, the Antilles, and Mauritius, that in these\r\n    countries sweet oranges faithfully transmit their character. Gallesio\r\n    found that the willow-leafed and the Little China oranges reproduced\r\n    their proper leaves and fruit; but the seedlings were not quite equal\r\n    in merit to their parents. The red-fleshed orange, on the other hand,\r\n    fails to reproduce itself. Gallesio also observed that the seeds of\r\n    several other singular varieties all reproduced trees having a peculiar\r\n    physiognomy, but partly resembling their parent-forms. I can adduce\r\n    another case: the myrtle-leaved orange is ranked by all authors as a\r\n    variety, but is very distinct in general aspect: in my father's\r\n    greenhouse, during many years, it rarely yielded any seed, but at last\r\n    produced one; and a tree thus raised was identical with the\r\n    parent-form.\r\n\r\n    Another and more serious difficulty in determining the rank of the\r\n    several forms is that, according to Gallesio,[630] they largely\r\n    intercross without {336} artificial aid; thus he positively states that\r\n    seeds taken from lemon-trees (_C. lemonum_) growing mingled with the\r\n    citron (_C. medica_), which is generally considered as a distinct\r\n    species, produced a graduated series of varieties between these two\r\n    forms. Again, an Adam's apple was produced from the seed of a sweet\r\n    orange, which grew close to lemons and citrons. But such facts hardly\r\n    aid us in determining whether to rank these forms as species or\r\n    varieties; for it is now known that undoubted species of Verbascum,\r\n    Cistus, Primula, Salix, &c., frequently cross in a state of nature. If\r\n    indeed it were proved that plants of the orange tribe raised from these\r\n    crosses were even partially sterile, it would be a strong argument in\r\n    favour of their rank as species. Gallesio asserts that this is the\r\n    case; but he does not distinguish between sterility from hybridism and\r\n    from the effects of culture; and he almost destroys the force of this\r\n    statement by another,[631] namely, that when he impregnated the flowers\r\n    of the common orange with the pollen taken from undoubted _varieties_\r\n    of the orange, monstrous fruits were produced, which included \"little\r\n    pulp, and had no seeds, or imperfect seeds.\"\r\n\r\n    In this tribe of plants we meet with instances of two highly remarkable\r\n    facts in vegetable physiology: Gallesio[632] impregnated an orange with\r\n    pollen from a lemon, and the fruit borne on the mother tree had a\r\n    raised stripe of peel like that of a lemon both in colour and taste,\r\n    but the pulp was like that of an orange and included only imperfect\r\n    seeds. The possibility of pollen from one variety or species directly\r\n    affecting the fruit produced by another variety or species, is a\r\n    subject which I shall fully discuss in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n    The second remarkable fact is that two supposed hybrids[633] (for their\r\n    hybrid nature was not ascertained) between an orange and either a lemon\r\n    or citron produced, on the same tree, leaves, flowers, and fruit of\r\n    both pure parent-forms, as well as of a mixed or crossed nature. A bud\r\n    taken from any one of the branches and grafted on another tree produces\r\n    either one of the pure kinds or a capricious tree reproducing the three\r\n    kinds. Whether the sweet lemon, which includes within the same fruit\r\n    segments of differently flavoured pulp,[634] is an analogous case, I\r\n    know not. But to this subject I shall have to recur.\r\n\r\n    I will conclude by giving from A. Risso[635] a short account of a very\r\n    singular variety of the common orange. It is the \"_citrus aurantium\r\n    fructu variabili_,\" which on the young shoots produces rounded-oval\r\n    leaves spotted with yellow, borne on petioles with heart-shaped wings;\r\n    when these leaves fall off, they are succeeded by longer and narrower\r\n    leaves, with undulated margins, of a pale-green colour embroidered with\r\n    yellow, borne on foot-stalks without wings. The fruit whilst young is\r\n    pear-shaped, yellow, longitudinally striated, and sweet; but as it\r\n    ripens, it becomes spherical, of a reddish-yellow, and bitter.\r\n\r\n    _Peach and Nectarine (Amygdalus Persica)._ The best authorities are\r\n    {337} nearly unanimous that the peach has never been found wild. It was\r\n    introduced from Persia into Europe a little before the Christian era,\r\n    and at this period few varieties existed. Alph. De Candolle,[636] from\r\n    the fact of the peach not having spread from Persia at an earlier\r\n    period, and from its not having pure Sanscrit or Hebrew names, believes\r\n    that it is not an aboriginal of Western Asia, but came from the _terra\r\n    incognita_ of China. The supposition, however, that the peach is a\r\n    modified almond which acquired its present character at a comparatively\r\n    late period, would, I presume, account for these facts; on the same\r\n    principle that the nectarine, the offspring of the peach, has few\r\n    native names, and became known in Europe at a still later period.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Peach and Almond Stones, of natural size,\r\n    viewed edgeways. 1. Common English Peach. 2. Double, crimson-flowered,\r\n    Chinese Peach. 3. Chinese Honey Peach. 4. English Almond. 5. Barcelona\r\n    Almond. 6. Malaga Almond. 7. Soft-shelled French Almond. 8. Smyrna\r\n    Almond.]\r\n\r\n    {338}\r\n\r\n    Andrew Knight,[637] from finding that a seedling-tree, raised from a\r\n    sweet almond fertilised by the pollen of a peach, yielded fruit quite\r\n    like that of a peach, suspected that the peach-tree is a modified\r\n    almond; and in this he has been followed by various authors.[638] A\r\n    first-rate peach, almost globular in shape, formed of soft and sweet\r\n    pulp, surrounding a hard, much furrowed, and slightly-flattened stone,\r\n    certainly differs greatly from an almond, with its soft, slightly\r\n    furrowed, much flattened, and elongated stone, protected by a tough,\r\n    greenish layer of bitter flesh. Mr. Bentham[639] has particularly\r\n    called attention to the stone of the almond being so much more\r\n    flattened than that of the peach. But in the several varieties of the\r\n    almond, the stone differs greatly in the degree to which it is\r\n    compressed, in size, shape, strength, and in the depth of the furrows,\r\n    as may be seen in the accompanying drawings (Nos. 4 to 8) of such kinds\r\n    as I have been able to collect. With peach-stones, also (Nos. 1 to 3)\r\n    the degree of compression and elongation is seen to vary; so that the\r\n    stone of the Chinese Honey-peach (fig. 3) is much more elongated and\r\n    compressed than that of the (No. 8) Smyrna almond. Mr. Rivers of\r\n    Sawbridgeworth, to whom I am indebted for some of the specimens above\r\n    figured, and who has had such great horticultural experience, has\r\n    called my attention to several varieties which connect the almond and\r\n    the peach. In France there is a variety called the Peach-almond, which\r\n    Mr. Rivers formerly cultivated, and which is correctly described in a\r\n    French catalogue as being oval and swollen, with the aspect of a peach,\r\n    including a hard stone surrounded by a fleshy covering, which is\r\n    sometimes eatable.[640] A remarkable statement by M. Luizet has\r\n    recently appeared in the 'Revue Horticole,'[641] namely, that a\r\n    Peach-almond, grafted on a peach, bore during 1863 and 1864 almonds\r\n    alone, but in 1865 bore six peaches and no almonds. M. Carrière, in\r\n    commenting on this fact, cites the case of a double-flowered almond\r\n    which, after producing during several years almonds, suddenly bore for\r\n    two years in succession spherical fleshy peach-like fruits, but in 1865\r\n    reverted to its former state and produced large almonds.\r\n\r\n    Again, as I hear from Mr. Rivers, the double-flowering Chinese peaches\r\n    resemble almonds in their manner of growth and in their flowers; the\r\n    fruit is much elongated and flattened, with the flesh both bitter and\r\n    sweet, but {339} not uneatable, and it is said to be of better quality\r\n    in China. From this stage one small step leads us to such inferior\r\n    peaches as are occasionally raised from seed. For instance, Mr. Rivers\r\n    sowed a number of peach-stones imported from the United States, where\r\n    they are collected for raising stocks, and some of the trees raised by\r\n    him produced peaches which were very like almonds in appearance, being\r\n    small and hard, with the pulp not softening till very late in the\r\n    autumn. Van Mons[642] also states that he once raised from a\r\n    peach-stone a peach having the aspect of a wild tree, with fruit like\r\n    that of the almond. From inferior peaches, such as these just\r\n    described, we may pass by small transitions, through clingstones of\r\n    poor quality, to our best and most melting kinds. From this gradation,\r\n    from the cases of sudden variation above recorded, and from the fact\r\n    that the peach has not been found wild, it seems to me by far the most\r\n    probable view, that the peach is the descendant of the almond, improved\r\n    and modified in a marvellous manner.\r\n\r\n    One fact, however, is opposed to this conclusion. A hybrid, raised by\r\n    Knight from the sweet almond by the pollen of the peach, produced\r\n    flowers with little or no pollen, yet bore fruit, having been\r\n    apparently fertilised by a neighbouring nectarine. Another hybrid from\r\n    a sweet almond by the pollen of a nectarine produced during the first\r\n    three years imperfect blossoms, but afterwards perfect flowers with an\r\n    abundance of pollen. If this slight degree of sterility cannot be\r\n    accounted for by the youth of the trees (and this often causes lessened\r\n    fertility), or by the monstrous state of the flowers, or by the\r\n    conditions to which the trees were exposed, these two cases would\r\n    afford a strong argument against the peach being the descendant of the\r\n    almond.\r\n\r\n    Whether or not the peach has proceeded from the almond, it has\r\n    certainly given rise to nectarines, or smooth peaches, as they are\r\n    called by the French. Most of the varieties both of the peach and\r\n    nectarine reproduce themselves truly by seed. Gallesio[643] says he has\r\n    verified this with respect to eight races of the peach. Mr. Rivers[644]\r\n    has given some striking instances from his own experience, and it is\r\n    notorious that good peaches are constantly raised in North America from\r\n    seed. Many of the American sub-varieties come true or nearly true to\r\n    their kind, such as the white-blossom, several of the yellow-fruited\r\n    freestone peaches, the blood clingstone, the heath, and the\r\n    lemon-clingstone. On the other hand, a clingstone peach has been known\r\n    to give rise to a freestone.[645] In England it has been noticed that\r\n    seedlings inherit from their parents flowers of the same size and\r\n    colour. Some characters, however, contrary to what might have been\r\n    expected, often are not inherited; such as the presence and form of the\r\n    glands on the leaves.[646] With respect to nectarines, both cling and\r\n    {340} freestones are known in North America to reproduce themselves by\r\n    seed.[647] In England the new white nectarine was a seedling of the old\r\n    white, and Mr. Rivers[648] has recorded several similar cases. From\r\n    this strong tendency to inheritance, which both peach and nectarine\r\n    trees exhibit,--from certain slight constitutional differences[649] in\r\n    their nature,--and from the great difference in their fruit both in\r\n    appearance and flavour, it is not surprising, notwithstanding that the\r\n    trees differ in no other respects and cannot even be distinguished, as\r\n    I am informed by Mr. Rivers, whilst young, that they have been ranked\r\n    by some authors as specifically distinct. Gallesio does not doubt that\r\n    they are distinct; even Alph. De Candolle does not appear perfectly\r\n    assured of their specific identity; and an eminent botanist has quite\r\n    recently[650] maintained that the nectarine \"probably constitutes a\r\n    distinct species.\"\r\n\r\n    Hence it may be worth while to give all the evidence on the origin of\r\n    the nectarine. The facts in themselves are curious, and will hereafter\r\n    have to be referred to when the important subject of bud-variation is\r\n    discussed. It is asserted[651] that the Boston nectarine was produced\r\n    from a peach-stone, and this nectarine reproduced itself by seed.[652]\r\n    Mr. Rivers states[653] that from stones of three distinct varieties of\r\n    the peach he raised three varieties of nectarine; and in one of these\r\n    cases no nectarine grew near the parent peach-tree. In another instance\r\n    Mr. Rivers raised a nectarine from a peach, and in the succeeding\r\n    generation another nectarine from this nectarine.[654] Other such\r\n    instances have been communicated to me, but they need not be given. Of\r\n    the converse case, namely, of nectarine-stones yielding peach-trees\r\n    (both free and cling-stones), we have six undoubted instances recorded\r\n    by Mr. Rivers; and in two of these instances the parent nectarines had\r\n    been seedlings from other nectarines.[655]\r\n\r\n    With respect to the more curious case of full-grown peach-trees\r\n    suddenly producing nectarines by bud-variation (or sports as they are\r\n    called by gardeners), the evidence is superabundant; there is also good\r\n    evidence of the same tree producing both peaches and nectarines, or\r\n    half and half fruit;--by this term I mean a fruit with the one-half a\r\n    perfect peach, and the other half a perfect nectarine.\r\n\r\n    Peter Collinson in 1741 recorded the first case of a peach-tree\r\n    producing a nectarine,[656] and in 1766 he added two other instances.\r\n    In the same work, the editor, Sir J. E. Smith, describes the more\r\n    remarkable case of a tree in Norfolk, which usually bore both perfect\r\n    nectarines and perfect peaches; but during two seasons some of the\r\n    fruit were half-and-half in nature.\r\n\r\n    {341} Mr. Salisbury in 1808[657] records six other cases of peach-trees\r\n    producing nectarines. Three of the varieties are named; viz., the\r\n    Alberge, Belle Chevreuse, and Royal George. This latter tree seldom\r\n    failed to produce both kinds of fruit. He gives another case of a\r\n    half-and-half fruit.\r\n\r\n    At Radford in Devonshire[658] a clingstone peach, purchased as the\r\n    Chancellor, was planted in 1815, and in 1824, after having previously\r\n    produced peaches alone, bore on one branch twelve nectarines; in 1825\r\n    the same branch yielded twenty-six nectarines, and in 1826 thirty-six\r\n    nectarines together with eighteen peaches. One of the peaches was\r\n    almost as smooth on one side as a nectarine. The nectarines were as\r\n    dark as, but smaller than, the Elruge.\r\n\r\n    At Beccles a Royal George peach[659] produced a fruit, \"three parts of\r\n    it being peach and one part nectarine, quite distinct in appearance as\r\n    well as in flavour.\" The lines of division were longitudinal, as\r\n    represented in the engraving. A nectarine-tree grew five yards from\r\n    this tree.\r\n\r\n    Professor Chapman states[660] that he has often seen in Virginia very\r\n    old peach-trees bearing nectarines.\r\n\r\n    A writer in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' says that a peach-tree planted\r\n    fifteen years previously[661] produced this year a nectarine between\r\n    two peaches; a nectarine-tree grew close by.\r\n\r\n    In 1844[662] a Vanguard peach-tree produced, in the midst of its\r\n    ordinary fruit, a single red Roman nectarine.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Calver is stated[663] to have raised in the United States a\r\n    seedling peach which produced a mixed crop of both peaches and\r\n    nectarines.\r\n\r\n    Near Dorking[664] a branch of the Têton de Venus peach, which\r\n    reproduces itself truly by seed,[665] bore its own fruit \"so remarkable\r\n    for its prominent point, and a nectarine rather smaller but well formed\r\n    and quite round.\"\r\n\r\n    The previous cases all refer to peaches suddenly producing nectarines,\r\n    but at Carclew[666] the unique case occurred, of a nectarine-tree,\r\n    raised twenty years before from seed and never grafted, producing a\r\n    fruit half peach and half nectarine; subsequently it bore a perfect\r\n    peach.\r\n\r\n    To sum up the foregoing facts: we have excellent evidence of\r\n    peach-stones producing nectarine-trees, and of nectarine-stones\r\n    producing peach-trees,--of the same tree bearing peaches and\r\n    nectarines,--of peach-trees suddenly producing by bud-variation\r\n    nectarines (such nectarines reproducing nectarines by seed), as well as\r\n    fruit in part nectarine and in part peach,--and lastly of one\r\n    nectarine-tree first bearing half-and-half fruit, and subsequently true\r\n    peaches. As the peach came into existence before the nectarine, it\r\n    might have been expected from the law of reversion that {342}\r\n    nectarines would give birth by bud-variation or by seed to peaches,\r\n    oftener than peaches to nectarines; but this is by no means the case.\r\n\r\n    Two explanations have been suggested to account for these conversions.\r\n    First, that the parent-trees have been in every case hybrids[667]\r\n    between the peach and nectarine, and have reverted by bud-variation or\r\n    by seed to one of their pure parent-forms. This view in itself is not\r\n    very improbable; for the Mountaineer peach, which was raised by Knight\r\n    from the red nutmeg peach by pollen of the violette hâtive\r\n    nectarine,[668] produces peaches, but these are said _sometimes_ to\r\n    partake of the smoothness and flavour of the nectarine. But let it be\r\n    observed that in the previous list no less than six well-known\r\n    varieties and several other unnamed varieties of the peach have once\r\n    suddenly produced perfect nectarines by bud-variation; and it would be\r\n    an extremely rash supposition that all these varieties of the peach,\r\n    which have been cultivated for years in many districts, and which show\r\n    not a vestige of a mixed parentage, are, nevertheless, hybrids. A\r\n    second explanation is, that the fruit of the peach has been directly\r\n    affected by the pollen of the nectarine: although this certainly is\r\n    possible, it cannot here apply; for we have not a shadow of evidence\r\n    that a branch which has borne fruit directly affected by foreign pollen\r\n    is so profoundly modified as afterwards to produce buds which continue\r\n    to yield fruit of the new and modified form. Now it is known that when\r\n    a bud on a peach-tree has once borne a nectarine the same branch has in\r\n    several instances gone on during successive years producing nectarines.\r\n    The Carclew nectarine, on the other hand, first produced half-and-half\r\n    fruit, and subsequently pure peaches. Hence we may confidently accept\r\n    the common view that the nectarine is a variety of the peach, which may\r\n    be produced either by bud-variation or from seed. In the following\r\n    chapter many analogous cases of bud-variation will be given.\r\n\r\n    The varieties of the peach and nectarine run in parallel lines. In both\r\n    classes the kinds differ from each other in the flesh of the fruit\r\n    being white, red, or yellow; in being clingstones or freestones; in the\r\n    flowers being large or small, with certain other characteristic\r\n    differences; and in the leaves being serrated without glands, or\r\n    crenated and furnished with globose or reniform glands.[669] We can\r\n    hardly account for this parallelism by supposing that each variety of\r\n    the nectarine is descended from a corresponding variety of the peach;\r\n    for though our nectarines are certainly the descendants of several\r\n    kinds of peaches, yet a large number are the descendants of other\r\n    nectarines, and they vary so much when thus reproduced that we can\r\n    scarcely admit the above explanation.\r\n\r\n    The varieties of the peach have largely increased in number since the\r\n    Christian era, when from two to five varieties alone were known;[670]\r\n    and the nectarine was unknown. At the present time, besides many\r\n    varieties said to exist in China, Downing describes in the United\r\n    States seventy-nine {343} native and imported varieties of the peach;\r\n    and a few years ago Lindley[671] enumerated one hundred and sixty-four\r\n    varieties of the peach and nectarine grown in England. I have already\r\n    indicated the chief points of difference between the several varieties.\r\n    Nectarines, even when produced from distinct kinds of peaches, always\r\n    possess their own peculiar flavour, and are smooth and small.\r\n    Clingstone and freestone peaches, which differ in the ripe flesh either\r\n    firmly adhering to the stone, or easily separating from it, also differ\r\n    in the character of the stone itself; that of the freestones or melters\r\n    being more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother\r\n    than in clingstones. In the various kinds, the flowers differ not only\r\n    in size, but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped,\r\n    more imbricated, generally red in the centre and pale towards the\r\n    margin; whereas in the smaller flowers the margins of the petal are\r\n    usually more darkly coloured. One variety has nearly white flowers. The\r\n    leaves are more or less serrated, and are either destitute of glands,\r\n    or have globose or reniform glands;[672] and some few peaches, such as\r\n    the Brugnon, bear on the same tree both globular and kidney-shaped\r\n    glands.[673] According to Robertson[674] the trees with glandular\r\n    leaves are liable to blister, but not in any great degree to mildew;\r\n    whilst the non-glandular trees are more subject to curl, to mildew, and\r\n    to the attacks of aphides. The varieties differ in the period of their\r\n    maturity, in the fruit keeping well, and in hardiness,--the latter\r\n    circumstance being especially attended to in the United States. Certain\r\n    varieties, such as the Bellegarde, stand forcing in hot-houses better\r\n    than other varieties. The flat-peach of China is the most remarkable of\r\n    all the varieties; it is so much depressed towards the summit, that the\r\n    stone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy\r\n    layer.[675] Another Chinese variety, called the Honey-peach, is\r\n    remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long sharp point; its leaves\r\n    are glandless and widely dentate.[676] The Emperor of Russia peach is a\r\n    third singular variety, having deeply and doubly serrated leaves; the\r\n    fruit is deeply cleft with one-half projecting considerably beyond the\r\n    other; it originated in America, and its seedlings inherit similar\r\n    leaves.[677]\r\n\r\n    The peach has also produced in China a small class of trees valued for\r\n    ornament, namely the double-flowered; of these five varieties are now\r\n    known in England, varying from pure white, through rose, to intense\r\n    crimson.[678] One of these varieties, called the camellia-flowered,\r\n    bears flowers above 2¼ inches in diameter, whilst those of the\r\n    fruit-bearing kinds do not at most exceed 1¼ inch in diameter. The\r\n    flowers of the {344} double-flowered peaches have the singular\r\n    property[679] of frequently producing double or treble fruit. Finally,\r\n    there is good reason to believe that the peach is an almond profoundly\r\n    modified; but whatever its origin may have been, there can be no doubt\r\n    that it has yielded during the last eighteen centuries many varieties,\r\n    some of them strongly characterised, belonging both to the nectarine\r\n    and peach form.\r\n\r\n    _Apricot_ (_Prunus armeniaca_).--It is commonly admitted that this tree\r\n    is descended from a single species, now found wild in the Caucasian\r\n    region.[680] On this view the varieties deserve notice, because they\r\n    illustrate differences supposed by some botanists to be of specific\r\n    value in the almond and plum. The best monograph on the apricot is by\r\n    Mr. Thompson,[681] who describes seventeen varieties. We have seen that\r\n    peaches and nectarines vary in a strictly parallel manner; and in the\r\n    apricot, which forms a closely allied genus, we again meet with\r\n    variations analogous to those of the peach, as well as to those of the\r\n    plum. The varieties differ considerably in the shape of their leaves,\r\n    which are either serrated or crenated, sometimes with ear-like\r\n    appendages at their bases, and sometimes with glands on the petioles.\r\n    The flowers are generally alike, but are small in the Masculine. The\r\n    fruit varies much in size, shape, and in having the suture little\r\n    pronounced or absent; in the skin being smooth, or downy as in the\r\n    orange-apricot; and in the flesh clinging to the stone, as in the\r\n    last-mentioned kind, or in readily separating from it, as in the\r\n    Turkey-apricot. In all these differences we see the closest analogy\r\n    with the varieties of the peach and nectarine. In the stone we have\r\n    more important differences, and these in the case of the plum have been\r\n    esteemed of specific value: in some apricots the stone is almost\r\n    spherical, in others much flattened, being either sharp in front or\r\n    blunt at both ends, sometimes channelled along the back, or with a\r\n    sharp ridge along both margins. In the Moorpark, and generally in the\r\n    Hemskirke, the stone presents a singular character in being perforated,\r\n    with a bundle of fibres passing through the perforation from end to\r\n    end. The most constant and important character, according to Thompson,\r\n    is whether the kernel is bitter or sweet; yet in this respect we have a\r\n    graduated difference, for the kernel is very bitter in Shipley's\r\n    apricot; in the Hemskirke less bitter than in some other kinds;\r\n    slightly bitter in the Royal; and \"sweet like a hazel-nut\" in the\r\n    Breda, Angoumois, and others. In the case of the almond, bitterness has\r\n    been thought by some high authorities to indicate specific difference.\r\n\r\n    In N. America the Roman apricot endures \"cold and unfavourable\r\n    situations, where no other sort, except the Masculine, will succeed;\r\n    and its blossoms bear quite a severe frost without injury.\"[682]\r\n    According to Mr. Rivers[683] seedling apricots deviate but little from\r\n    the character of {345} their race: in France the Alberge is constantly\r\n    reproduced from seed with but little variation. In Ladakh, according to\r\n    Moorcroft,[684] ten varieties of the apricot, very different from each\r\n    other, are cultivated, and all are raised from seed, excepting one,\r\n    which is budded.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 43.--Plum Stones, of natural size, viewed\r\n    laterally. 1. Bullace Plum. 2. Shropshire Damson. 3. Blue Gage. 4.\r\n    Orleans. 5. Elvas. 6. Denyer's Victoria. 7. Diamond.]\r\n\r\n    _Plums_ (_Prunus insititia_).--Formerly the sloe, _P. spinosa_, was\r\n    thought to be the parent of all our plums; but now this honour is very\r\n    commonly accorded to _P. insititia_ or the bullace, which is found wild\r\n    in the Caucasus and N.-Western India, and is naturalised in\r\n    England.[685] It is not at all improbable, in accordance with some\r\n    observations made by Mr. Rivers[686] that both these forms, which some\r\n    botanists rank as a single species, may be the parents of our\r\n    domesticated plums. Another supposed parent-form, the _P. domestica_,\r\n    is said to be found wild in the region of the Caucasus. Godron\r\n    remarks[687] that the cultivated varieties may be divided into two main\r\n    groups, which he supposes to be descended from two aboriginal stocks;\r\n    namely, those with oblong fruit and stones pointed at both ends, having\r\n    narrow separate petals and upright branches; and those with rounded\r\n    fruit, with stones blunt at both ends, with rounded petals and\r\n    spreading branches. From what we know of the variability of the flowers\r\n    in the peach and of the diversified manner of growth in our various\r\n    fruit-trees, it is difficult to lay much weight on these latter {346}\r\n    characters. With respect to the shape of the fruit, we have conclusive\r\n    evidence that it is extremely variable: Downing[688] gives outlines of\r\n    the plums of two seedlings, namely, the red and imperial gages, raised\r\n    from the greengage; and the fruit of both is more elongated than that\r\n    of the greengage. The latter has a very blunt broad stone, whereas the\r\n    stone of the imperial gage is \"oval and pointed at both ends.\" These\r\n    trees also differ in their manner of growth: \"the greengage is a very\r\n    short-jointed, slow-growing tree, of spreading and rather dwarfish\r\n    habit;\" whilst its offspring, the imperial gage, \"grows freely and\r\n    rises rapidly, and has long dark shoots.\" The famous Washington plum\r\n    bears a globular fruit, but its offspring, the emerald drop, is nearly\r\n    as much elongated as the most elongated plum figured by Downing,\r\n    namely, Manning's prune. I have made a small collection of the stones\r\n    of twenty-five kinds, and they graduate in shape from the bluntest into\r\n    the sharpest kinds. As characters derived from seeds are generally of\r\n    high systematic importance, I have thought it worth while to give\r\n    drawings of the most distinct kinds in my small collection; and they\r\n    may be seen to differ in a surprising manner in size, outline,\r\n    thickness, prominence of the ridges, and state of surface. It deserves\r\n    notice that the shape of the stone is not always strictly correlated\r\n    with that of the fruit: thus the Washington plum is spherical and\r\n    depressed at the pole, with a somewhat elongated stone, whilst the\r\n    fruit of the Goliath is more elongated, but the stone less so, than in\r\n    the Washington. Again, Denyer's Victoria and Goliath bear fruit closely\r\n    resembling each other, but their stones are widely different. On the\r\n    other hand, the Harvest and Black Margate plums are very dissimilar,\r\n    yet include closely similar stones.\r\n\r\n    The varieties of the plum are numerous, and differ greatly in size,\r\n    shape, quality, and colour,--being bright yellow, green, almost white,\r\n    blue, purple, or red. There are some curious varieties, such as the\r\n    double or Siamese, and the Stoneless plum: in the latter the kernel\r\n    lies in a roomy cavity surrounded only by the pulp. The climate of\r\n    North America appears to be singularly favourable for the production of\r\n    new and good varieties; Downing describes no less than forty, seven of\r\n    which of first-rate quality have been recently introduced into\r\n    England.[689] Varieties occasionally arise having an innate adaptation\r\n    for certain soils, almost as strongly pronounced as with natural\r\n    species growing on the most distinct geological formations; thus in\r\n    America the imperial gage, differently from almost all other kinds, \"is\r\n    peculiarly fitted for _dry light_ soils where many sorts drop their\r\n    fruit,\" whereas on rich heavy soils the fruit is often insipid.[690] My\r\n    father could never succeed in making the Wine-Sour yield even a\r\n    moderate crop in a sandy orchard near Shrewsbury, whilst in some parts\r\n    of the same county and in its native Yorkshire it bears abundantly: one\r\n    of my {347} relations also repeatedly tried in vain to grow this\r\n    variety in a sandy district in Staffordshire.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Rivers has given[691] a number of interesting facts, showing how\r\n    truly many varieties can be propagated by seed. He sowed the stones of\r\n    twenty bushels of the greengage for the sake of raising stocks, and\r\n    closely observed the seedlings; \"all had the smooth shoots, the\r\n    prominent buds, and the glossy leaves of the greengage, but the greater\r\n    number had smaller leaves and thorns.\" There are two kinds of damson,\r\n    one the Shropshire with downy shoots, and the other the Kentish with\r\n    smooth shoots, and these differ but slightly in any other respect: Mr.\r\n    Rivers sowed some bushels of the Kentish damson, and all the\r\n    seedlings-had smooth shoots, but in some the fruit was oval, in others\r\n    round or roundish, and in a few the fruit was small, and, except in\r\n    being sweet, closely resembled that of the wild sloe. Mr. Rivers gives\r\n    several other striking instances of inheritance: thus, he raised eighty\r\n    thousand seedlings from the common German Quetsche plum, and \"not one\r\n    could be found varying in the least, in foliage or habit.\" Similar\r\n    facts were observed with the Petite Mirabelle plum, yet this latter\r\n    kind (as well as the Quetsche) is known to have yielded some\r\n    well-established varieties; but, as Mr. Rivers remarks, they all belong\r\n    to the same group with the Mirabelle.\r\n\r\n    _Cherries (Prunus cerasus, avium_, &c.).--Botanists believe that our\r\n    cultivated cherries are descended from one, two, four, or even more\r\n    wild stocks.[692] That there must be at least two parent-species we may\r\n    infer from the sterility of twenty hybrids raised by Mr. Knight from\r\n    the morello fertilized by pollen of the Elton cherry; for these hybrids\r\n    produced in all only five cherries, and one alone of these contained a\r\n    seed.[693] Mr. Thompson[694] has classified the varieties in an\r\n    apparently natural method in two main groups by characters taken from\r\n    the flowers, fruit, and leaves; but some varieties which stand widely\r\n    separate in this classification are quite fertile when crossed; thus\r\n    Knight's Early Black cherry is the product of a cross between two such\r\n    kinds.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Knight states that seedling cherries are more variable than those\r\n    of any other fruit-tree.[695] In the Catalogue of the Horticultural\r\n    Society for 1842, eighty varieties are enumerated. Some varieties\r\n    present singular characters: thus the flower of the Cluster cherry\r\n    includes as many as twelve pistils, of which the majority abort; and\r\n    they are said generally to produce from two to five or six cherries\r\n    aggregated together and borne on a single peduncle. In the Ratafia\r\n    cherry several flower-peduncles arise from a common peduncle, upwards\r\n    of an inch in length. The fruit of Gascoigne's Heart has its apex\r\n    produced into a globule or drop: that of the white {348} Hungarian Gean\r\n    has almost transparent flesh. The Flemish cherry is \"a very odd-looking\r\n    fruit,\" much flattened at the summit and base, with the latter deeply\r\n    furrowed, and borne on a stout very short footstalk. In the Kentish\r\n    cherry the stone adheres so firmly to the footstalk, that it can be\r\n    drawn out of the flesh; and this renders the fruit well fitted for\r\n    drying. The Tobacco-leaved cherry, according to Sageret and Thompson,\r\n    produces gigantic leaves, more than a foot and sometimes even eighteen\r\n    inches in length, and half a foot in breadth. The Weeping cherry, on\r\n    the other hand, is valuable only as an ornament, and, according to\r\n    Downing, is \"a charming little tree with slender weeping branches,\r\n    clothed with small almost myrtle-like foliage.\" There is also a\r\n    peach-leaved variety.\r\n\r\n    Sageret describes a remarkable variety, _le griottier de la Toussaint_,\r\n    which bears at the same time, even as late as September, flowers and\r\n    fruit of all degrees of maturity. The fruit, which is of inferior\r\n    quality, is borne on long, very thin footstalks. But the extraordinary\r\n    statement is made that all the leaf-bearing shoots spring from old\r\n    flower-buds. Lastly, there is an important physiological distinction\r\n    between those kinds of cherries which bear fruit on young or on old\r\n    wood; but Sageret positively asserts that a Bigarreau in his garden\r\n    bore fruit on wood of both ages.[696]\r\n\r\n    _Apple (Pyrus malus)._--The one source of doubt felt by botanists with\r\n    respect to the parentage of the apple is whether, besides _P. malus_,\r\n    two or three other closely allied wild forms, namely, _P. acerba_ and\r\n    _præcox_ or _paradisiaca_, do not deserve to be ranked as distinct\r\n    species. The _P. præcox_ is supposed by some authors[697] to be the\r\n    parent of the dwarf paradise stock, which, owing to the fibrous roots\r\n    not penetrating deeply into the ground, is so largely used for\r\n    grafting; but the paradise stock, it is asserted,[698] cannot be\r\n    propagated true by seed. The common wild crab varies considerably in\r\n    England; but many of the varieties are believed to be escaped\r\n    seedlings.[699] Every one knows the great difference in the manner of\r\n    growth, in the foliage, flowers, and especially in the fruit, between\r\n    the almost innumerable varieties of the apple. The pips or seeds (as I\r\n    know by comparison) likewise differ considerably in shape, size, and\r\n    colour. The fruit is adapted for eating or for cooking in different\r\n    ways, and keeps for only a few weeks or for nearly two years. Some few\r\n    kinds have the fruit covered with a powdery secretion, called bloom,\r\n    like that on plums; {349} and \"it is extremely remarkable that this\r\n    occurs almost exclusively among varieties cultivated in Russia.\"[700]\r\n    Another Russian apple, the white Astracan, possesses the singular\r\n    property of becoming transparent, when ripe, like some sorts of crabs.\r\n    The _api étoilé_ has five prominent ridges, hence its name; the _api\r\n    noir_ is nearly black: the _twin cluster pippin_ often bears fruit\r\n    joined in pairs.[701] The trees of the several sorts differ greatly in\r\n    their periods of leafing and flowering; in my orchard the _Court Pendu\r\n    Plat_ produces its leaves so late, that during several springs I have\r\n    thought it dead. The Tiffin apple scarcely bears a leaf when in full\r\n    bloom; the Cornish crab, on the other hand, bears so many leaves at\r\n    this period that the flowers can hardly be seen.[702] In some kinds the\r\n    fruit ripens in midsummer; in others, late in the autumn. These several\r\n    differences in leafing, flowering, and fruiting, are not at all\r\n    necessarily correlated; for, as Andrew Knight has remarked,[703] no one\r\n    can judge from the early flowering of a new seedling, or from the early\r\n    shedding or change of colour of the leaves, whether it will mature its\r\n    fruit early in the season.\r\n\r\n    The varieties differ greatly in constitution. It is notorious that our\r\n    summers are not hot enough for the Newtown Pippin,[704] which is the\r\n    glory of the orchards near New York; and so it is with several\r\n    varieties which we have imported from the Continent. On the other hand,\r\n    our Court of Wick succeeds well under the severe climate of Canada. The\r\n    _Calville rouge de Micoud_ occasionally bears two crops during the same\r\n    year. The Burr Knot is covered with small excrescences, which emit\r\n    roots so readily that a branch with blossom-buds may be stuck in the\r\n    ground, and will root and bear a few fruit even during the first\r\n    year.[705] Mr. Rivers has recently described[706] some seedlings\r\n    valuable from their roots running near the surface. One of these\r\n    seedlings was remarkable from its extremely dwarfed size, \"forming\r\n    itself into a bush only a few inches in height.\" Many varieties are\r\n    particularly liable to canker in certain soils. But perhaps the\r\n    strangest constitutional peculiarity is that the Winter Majetin is not\r\n    attacked by the mealy bug or coccus; Lindley[707] states that in an\r\n    orchard in Norfolk infested with these insects the Majetin was quite\r\n    free, though the stock on which it was grafted was affected: Knight\r\n    makes a similar statement with respect to a cider apple, and adds that\r\n    he only once saw these insects just above the stock, but that three\r\n    days afterwards they entirely disappeared; this apple, however, was\r\n    raised from a cross between {350} the Golden Harvey and the Siberian\r\n    Crab; and the latter, I believe, is considered by some authors as\r\n    specifically distinct.\r\n\r\n    The famous St. Valery apple must not be passed over; the flower has a\r\n    double calyx with ten divisions, and fourteen styles surmounted by\r\n    conspicuous oblique stigmas, but is destitute of stamens or corolla.\r\n    The fruit is constricted round the middle, and is formed of five\r\n    seed-cells, surmounted by nine other cells.[708] Not being provided\r\n    with stamens, the tree requires artificial fertilisation; and the girls\r\n    of St. Valery annually go to \"_faire ses pommes_,\" each marking her own\r\n    fruit with a ribbon; and as different pollen is used, the fruit\r\n    differs, and we here have an instance of the direct action of foreign\r\n    pollen on the mother-plant. These monstrous apples include, as we have\r\n    seen, fourteen seed-cells; the pigeon-apple,[709] on the other hand,\r\n    has only four, instead of, as with all common apples, five cells; and\r\n    this certainly is a remarkable difference.\r\n\r\n    In the catalogue of apples published in 1842 by the Horticultural\r\n    Society, 897 varieties are enumerated; but the differences between most\r\n    of them are of comparatively little interest, as they are not strictly\r\n    inherited. No one can raise, for instance, from the seed of the Ribston\r\n    Pippin, a tree of the same kind; and it is said that the \"Sister\r\n    Ribston Pippin\" was a white, semi-transparent, sour-fleshed apple, or\r\n    rather large crab.[710] Yet it is a mistake to suppose that with most\r\n    varieties the characters are not to a certain extent inherited. In two\r\n    lots of seedlings raised from two well-marked kinds, many worthless,\r\n    crab-like seedlings will appear, but it is now known that the two lots\r\n    not only usually differ from each other, but resemble to a certain\r\n    extent their parents. We see this indeed in the several sub-groups of\r\n    Russetts, Sweetings, Codlins, Pearmains, Reinettes, &c.,[711] which are\r\n    all believed, and many are known, to be descended from other varieties\r\n    bearing the same names.\r\n\r\n    _Pears (Pyrus communis)._--I need say little on this fruit, which\r\n    varies much in the wild state, and to an extraordinary degree when\r\n    cultivated, in its fruit, flowers, and foliage. One of the most\r\n    celebrated botanists in Europe, M. Decaisne, has carefully studied the\r\n    many varieties;[712] although he formerly believed that they were\r\n    derived from more than one species, he is now convinced that all belong\r\n    to one. He has arrived at this conclusion from finding in the several\r\n    varieties a perfect gradation between the most extreme characters; so\r\n    perfect is this gradation that he maintains it to be impossible to\r\n    classify the varieties by any natural method. M. Decaisne raised many\r\n    seedlings from four distinct kinds, and has carefully recorded the\r\n    variations in each. Notwithstanding this extreme degree of {351}\r\n    variability, it is now positively known that many kinds reproduce by\r\n    seed the leading characters of their race.[713]\r\n\r\n    _Strawberries (Fragaria)._--This fruit is remarkable, on account of the\r\n    number of species which have been cultivated, and from their rapid\r\n    improvement within the last fifty or sixty years. Let any one compare\r\n    the fruit of one of the largest varieties exhibited at our Shows with\r\n    that of the wild wood strawberry, or, which will be a fairer\r\n    comparison, with the somewhat larger fruit of the wild American\r\n    Virginian Strawberry, and he will see what prodigies horticulture has\r\n    effected.[714] The number of varieties has likewise increased in a\r\n    surprisingly rapid manner. Only three kinds were known in France, in\r\n    1746, where this fruit was early cultivated. In 1766 five species had\r\n    been introduced, the same which are now cultivated, but only five\r\n    varieties of _Fragaria vesca_, with some sub-varieties, had been\r\n    produced. At the present day the varieties of the several species are\r\n    almost innumerable. The species consist of, firstly, the wood or Alpine\r\n    cultivated strawberries, descended from _F. vesca_, a native of Europe\r\n    and of North America. There are eight wild European varieties, as\r\n    ranked by Duchesne, of _F. vesca_, but several of these are considered\r\n    species by some botanists. Secondly, the green strawberries, descended\r\n    from the European _F. collina_, and little cultivated in England.\r\n    Thirdly, the Hautbois, from the European _F. elatior_. Fourthly, the\r\n    Scarlets, descended from _F. Virginiana_, a native of the whole breadth\r\n    of North America. Fifthly, the Chili, descended from _F. Chiloensis_,\r\n    an inhabitant of the west coast of the temperate parts both of North\r\n    and South America. Lastly, the Pines or Carolinas (including the old\r\n    Blacks), which have been ranked by most authors under the name of _F.\r\n    grandiflora_ as a distinct species, said to inhabit Surinam; but this\r\n    is a manifest error. This form is considered by the highest authority,\r\n    M. Gay, to be merely a strongly marked race of _F. Chiloensis_.[715]\r\n    These five or six forms have been ranked by most botanists as\r\n    specifically distinct; but this may be doubted, for Andrew Knight,[716]\r\n    who raised no less than 400 crossed strawberries, asserts that the _F.\r\n    Virginiana_, _Chiloensis_, and _grandiflora_ \"may be made to breed\r\n    together indiscriminately,\" and he found, in accordance with the\r\n    principle of analogous variation, \"that similar varieties could be\r\n    obtained from the seeds of any one of them.\"\r\n\r\n    Since Knight's time there is abundant and additional evidence[717] of\r\n    the extent to which the American forms spontaneously cross. We owe\r\n    {352} indeed to such crosses most of our choicest existing varieties.\r\n    Knight did not succeed in crossing the European wood-strawberry with\r\n    the American Scarlet or with the Hautbois. Mr. Williams, of Pitmaston,\r\n    however, succeeded; but the hybrid offspring from the Hautbois, though\r\n    fruiting well, never produced seed, with the exception of a single one,\r\n    which reproduced the parent hybrid form.[718] Major E. Trevor Clarke\r\n    informs me that he crossed two members of the Pine class (Myatt's B.\r\n    Queen and Keen's Seedling), with the wood and hautbois, and that in\r\n    each case he raised only a single seedling; one of these fruited, but\r\n    was almost barren. Mr. W. Smith, of York, has raised similar hybrids\r\n    with equally poor success.[719] We thus see[720] that the European and\r\n    American species can with some difficulty be crossed; but it is\r\n    improbable that hybrids sufficiently fertile to be worth cultivation\r\n    will ever be thus produced. This fact is surprising, as these forms\r\n    structurally are not widely distinct, and are sometimes connected in\r\n    the districts where they grow wild, as I hear from Professor Asa Gray,\r\n    by puzzling intermediate forms.\r\n\r\n    The energetic culture of the strawberry is of recent date, and the\r\n    cultivated varieties can in most cases still be classed under some one\r\n    of the above five native stocks. As the American strawberries cross so\r\n    freely and spontaneously, we can hardly doubt that they will ultimately\r\n    become inextricably confused. We find, indeed, that horticulturists at\r\n    present disagree under which class to rank some few of the varieties;\r\n    and a writer in the 'Bon Jardinier' of 1840 remarks that formerly it\r\n    was possible to class all of them under some one species, but that now\r\n    this is quite impossible with the American forms, the new English\r\n    varieties having completely filled up the gaps between them.[721] The\r\n    blending together of two or more aboriginal forms, which there is every\r\n    reason to believe has occurred with some of our anciently cultivated\r\n    productions, we now see actually occurring with our strawberries.\r\n\r\n    The cultivated species offer some variations worth notice. The Black\r\n    Prince, a seedling from Keen's Imperial (this latter being a seedling\r\n    of a very white strawberry, the white Carolina), is remarkable from\r\n    \"its peculiar dark and polished surface, and from presenting an\r\n    appearance entirely unlike that of any other kind.\"[722] Although the\r\n    fruit in the different varieties differs so greatly in form, size,\r\n    colour, and quality, the so-called seed (which corresponds with the\r\n    whole fruit in the plum), with the exception of being more or less\r\n    deeply embedded in the pulp, is, according to De Jonghe,[723]\r\n    absolutely the same in all; and this no doubt may be accounted for by\r\n    the seed being of no value, and consequently not having been subjected\r\n    to selection. The strawberry is properly three-leaved, but in 1761\r\n    Duchesne raised a single-leaved variety of the European {353}\r\n    wood-strawberry, which Linnæus doubtfully raised to the rank of a\r\n    species. Seedlings of this variety, like those of most varieties not\r\n    fixed by long-continued selection, often revert to the ordinary form,\r\n    or present intermediate states.[724] A variety raised by Mr.\r\n    Myatt,[725] apparently belonging to one of the American forms, presents\r\n    a variation of an opposite nature, for it has five leaves; Godron and\r\n    Lambertye also mention a five-leaved variety of _F. collina_.\r\n\r\n    The Red Bush Alpine strawberry (one of the _F. vesca_ section) does not\r\n    produce stolons or runners, and this remarkable deviation of structure\r\n    is reproduced truly by seed. Another sub-variety, the White Bush\r\n    Alpine, is similarly characterised, but when propagated by seed it\r\n    often degenerates and produces plants with runners.[726] A strawberry\r\n    of the American Pine section is also said to make but few runners.[727]\r\n\r\n    Much has been written on the sexes of strawberries; the true Hautbois\r\n    properly bears the male and female organs on separate plants,[728] and\r\n    was consequently named by Duchesne _dioica_; but it frequently produces\r\n    hermaphrodites; and Lindley,[729] by propagating such plants by\r\n    runners, at the same time destroying the males, soon raised a\r\n    self-prolific stock. The other species often show a tendency towards an\r\n    imperfect separation of the sexes, as I have noticed with plants forced\r\n    in a hot-house. Several English varieties, which in this country are\r\n    free from any such tendency, when cultivated in rich soils under the\r\n    climate of North America[730] commonly produce plants with separate\r\n    sexes. Thus a whole acre of Keen's Seedlings in the United States has\r\n    been observed to be almost sterile from the absence of male flowers;\r\n    but the more general rule is, that the male plants overrun the females.\r\n    Some members of the Cincinnati Horticultural Society, especially\r\n    appointed to investigate this subject, report that \"few varieties have\r\n    the flowers perfect in both sexual organs,\" &c. The most successful\r\n    cultivators in Ohio, plant for every seven rows of \"pistillata,\" or\r\n    female plants, one row of hermaphrodites, which afford pollen for both\r\n    kinds; but the hermaphrodites, owing to their expenditure in the\r\n    production of pollen, bear less fruit than the female plants.\r\n\r\n    The varieties differ in constitution. Some of our best English kinds,\r\n    such as Keen's Seedlings, are too tender for certain parts of North\r\n    America, where other English and many American varieties succeed\r\n    perfectly. That splendid fruit, the British Queen, can be cultivated\r\n    but in few places either in England or France; but this apparently\r\n    depends more on the nature of the soil than on the climate: a famous\r\n    gardener says that \"no mortal could grow the British Queen at Shrubland\r\n    Park unless the whole nature of the soil was altered.\"[731] La\r\n    Constantina is one of the {354} hardiest kinds, and can withstand\r\n    Russian winters, but is easily burnt by the sun, so that it will not\r\n    succeed in certain soils either in England or the United States.[732]\r\n    The Filbert Pine Strawberry \"requires more water than any other\r\n    variety; and if the plants once suffer from drought, they will do\r\n    little or no good afterwards.\"[733] Cuthill's Black Prince Strawberry\r\n    evinces a singular tendency to mildew: no less than six cases have been\r\n    recorded of this variety suffering severely, whilst other varieties\r\n    growing close by, and treated in exactly the same manner, were not at\r\n    all infested by this fungus.[734] The time of maturity differs much in\r\n    the different varieties; some belonging to the wood or alpine section\r\n    produce a succession of crops throughout the summer.\r\n\r\n    _Gooseberry_ (_Ribes grossularia_).--No one, I believe, has hitherto\r\n    doubted that all the cultivated kinds are sprung from the wild plant\r\n    bearing this name, which is common in Central and Northern Europe;\r\n    therefore it will be desirable briefly to specify all the points,\r\n    though not very important, which have varied. If it be admitted that\r\n    these differences are due to culture, authors perhaps will not be so\r\n    ready to assume the existence of a large number of unknown wild\r\n    parent-stocks for our other cultivated plants. The gooseberry is not\r\n    alluded to by writers of the classical period. Turner mentions it in\r\n    1573, and Parkinson, in 1629, specifies eight varieties; the Catalogue\r\n    of the Horticultural Society for 1842 gives 149 varieties, and the\r\n    lists of the Lancashire nurserymen are said to include above 300\r\n    names.[735] In the 'Gooseberry Grower's Register for 1862' I find that\r\n    243 distinct varieties have at various periods won prizes; so that a\r\n    vast number must have been exhibited. No doubt the difference between\r\n    many of the varieties is very small; but Mr. Thompson in classifying\r\n    the fruit for the Horticultural Society found less confusion in the\r\n    nomenclature of the gooseberry than of any other fruit, and he\r\n    attributes this \"to the great interest which the prize-growers have\r\n    taken in detecting sorts with wrong names,\" and this shows that all the\r\n    kinds, numerous as they are, can be recognised with certainty.\r\n\r\n    The bushes differ in their manner of growth, being erect, or spreading,\r\n    or pendulous. The periods of leafing and flowering differ both\r\n    absolutely and relatively to each other; thus the Whitesmith produces\r\n    early flowers, which from not being protected by the foliage, as it is\r\n    believed, continually fail to produce fruit.[736] The leaves vary in\r\n    size, tint, and in depth of lobes; they are smooth, downy, or hairy on\r\n    the upper surface. The branches are more or less downy or spinose; \"the\r\n    Hedgehog has probably derived its name from the singular bristly\r\n    condition of its shoots and fruit.\" The branches of the wild\r\n    gooseberry, I may remark, are smooth, with the exception of thorns at\r\n    the bases of the buds. The thorns themselves are either very small, few\r\n    and single, or very large and triple; they are {355} sometimes reflexed\r\n    and much dilated at their bases. In the different varieties the fruit\r\n    varies in abundance, in the period of maturity, in hanging until\r\n    shrivelled, and greatly in size, \"some sorts having their fruit large\r\n    during a very early period of growth, whilst others are small until\r\n    nearly ripe.\" The fruit varies also much in colour, being red, yellow,\r\n    green, and white--the pulp of one dark-red gooseberry being tinged with\r\n    yellow; in flavour; in being smooth or downy,--few, however, of the Red\r\n    gooseberries, whilst many of the so-called Whites, are downy; or in\r\n    being so spinose that one kind is called Henderson's Porcupine. Two\r\n    kinds acquire when mature a powdery bloom on their fruit. The fruit\r\n    varies in the thickness and veining of the skin, and, lastly, in shape,\r\n    being spherical, oblong, oval, or obovate.[737]\r\n\r\n    I cultivated fifty-four varieties, and, considering how greatly the\r\n    fruit differs, it was curious how closely similar the flowers were in\r\n    all these kinds. In only a few I detected a trace of difference in the\r\n    size or colour of the corolla. The calyx differed in a rather greater\r\n    degree, for in some kinds it was much redder than in others; and in one\r\n    smooth white gooseberry it was unusually red. The calyx also differed\r\n    in the basal part being smooth or woolly, or covered with glandular\r\n    hairs. It deserves notice, as being contrary to what might have been\r\n    expected from the law of correlation, that a smooth red gooseberry had\r\n    a remarkably hairy calyx. The flowers of the Sportsman are furnished\r\n    with very large coloured bracteæ; and this is the most singular\r\n    deviation of structure which I have observed. These same flowers also\r\n    varied much in the number of the petals, and occasionally in the number\r\n    of the stamens and pistils; so that they were semi-monstrous in\r\n    structure, yet they produced plenty of fruit. Mr. Thompson remarks that\r\n    in the Pastime gooseberry \"extra bracts are often attached to the sides\r\n    of the fruit.\"[738]\r\n\r\n    The most interesting point in the history of the gooseberry is the\r\n    steady increase in the size of the fruit. Manchester is the metropolis\r\n    of the fanciers, and prizes from five shillings to five or ten pounds\r\n    are yearly given for the heaviest fruit. The 'Gooseberry Grower's\r\n    Register' is published annually; the earliest known copy is dated 1786,\r\n    but it is certain that meetings for the adjudication of prizes were\r\n    held some years previously.[739] The 'Register' for 1845 gives an\r\n    account of 171 Gooseberry Shows, held in different places during that\r\n    year; and this fact shows on how large a scale the culture has been\r\n    carried on. The fruit of the wild gooseberry is said[740] to weigh\r\n    about a quarter of an ounce or 5 dwts., that is, 120 grains; about the\r\n    year 1786 gooseberries were exhibited weighing 10 dwts., so that the\r\n    weight was then doubled; in 1817 26 dwts. 17 grs. was attained; there\r\n    was no advance till 1825, when 31 dwts. 16 grs. was reached; in {356}\r\n    1830 \"Teazer\" weighed 32 dwts. 13 grs.; in 1841 \"Wonderful\" weighed 32\r\n    dwts. 16 grs.; in 1844 \"London\" weighed 35 dwts. 12 grs., and in the\r\n    following year 36 dwts. 16 grs.; and in 1852 in Staffordshire the fruit\r\n    of this same variety reached the astonishing weight of 37 dwts. 7\r\n    grs.,[741] or 895 grs.; that is, between seven and eight times the\r\n    weight of the wild fruit. I find that a small apple, 6½ inches in\r\n    circumference, has exactly this same weight. The \"London\" gooseberry\r\n    (which in 1862 had altogether gained 343 prizes) has, up to the present\r\n    year of 1864, never reached a greater weight than that attained in\r\n    1852. Perhaps the fruit of the gooseberry has now reached the greatest\r\n    possible weight, unless in the course of time some quite new and\r\n    distinct variety shall arise.\r\n\r\n    This gradual, and on the whole steady increase of weight from the\r\n    latter part of the last century to the year 1852, is probably in large\r\n    part due to improved methods of cultivation, for extreme care is now\r\n    taken; the branches and roots are trained, composts are made, the soil\r\n    is mulched, and only a few berries are left on each bush;[742] but the\r\n    increase no doubt is in main part due to the continued selection of\r\n    seedlings which have been found to be more and more capable of yielding\r\n    such extraordinary fruit. Assuredly the \"Highwayman\" in 1817 could not\r\n    have produced fruit like that of the \"Roaring Lion\" in 1825; nor could\r\n    the \"Roaring Lion,\" though it was grown by many persons in many places,\r\n    gain the supreme triumph achieved in 1852 by the \"London\" Gooseberry.\r\n\r\n    _Walnut_ (_Juglans regia_).--This tree and the common nut belong to a\r\n    widely different order from the foregoing fruits, and are therefore\r\n    here noticed. The walnut grows wild in the Caucasus and Himalaya, where\r\n    Dr. Hooker[743] found the fruit of full size, but \"as hard as a\r\n    hickory-nut.\" In England the walnut presents considerable differences,\r\n    in the shape and size of the fruit, in the thickness of the husk, and\r\n    in the thinness of the shell; this latter quality has given rise to a\r\n    variety called the thin-shelled, which is valuable, but suffers from\r\n    the attacks of tom-tits.[744] The degree to which the kernel fills the\r\n    shell varies much. In France there is a variety called the Grape or\r\n    cluster-walnut, in which the nuts grow in \"bunches of ten, fifteen, or\r\n    even twenty together.\" There is another variety which bears on the same\r\n    tree differently shaped leaves, like the heterophyllous hornbeam; this\r\n    tree is also remarkable from having pendulous branches, and bearing\r\n    elongated, large, thin-shelled nuts.[745] M. Cardan has minutely\r\n    described[746] some singular physiological peculiarities in the\r\n    June-leafing variety, which produces its leaves and flowers four or\r\n    five weeks later, and retains its leaves and fruit in the autumn much\r\n    longer, than the common varieties; {357} but in August is in exactly\r\n    the same state with them. These constitutional peculiarities are\r\n    strictly inherited. Lastly, walnut-trees, which are properly monoicous,\r\n    sometimes entirely fail to produce male flowers.[747]\r\n\r\n    _Nuts_ (_Corylus avellana_).--Most botanists rank all the varieties\r\n    under the same species, the common wild nut.[748] The husk, or\r\n    involucre, differs greatly, being extremely short in Barr's Spanish,\r\n    and extremely long in filberts, in which it is contracted so as to\r\n    prevent the nut falling out. This kind of husk also protects the nut\r\n    from birds, for titmice (_Parus_) have been observed[749] to pass over\r\n    filberts, and attack cobs and common nuts growing in the same orchard.\r\n    In the purple-filbert the husk is purple, and in the frizzled-filbert\r\n    it is curiously laciniated; in the red-filbert the pellicle of the\r\n    kernel is red. The shell is thick in some varieties, but is thin in\r\n    Cosford's-nut, and in one variety is of a bluish colour. The nut itself\r\n    differs much in size and shape, being ovate and compressed in filberts,\r\n    nearly round and of great size in cobs and Spanish nuts, oblong and\r\n    longitudinally striated in Cosford's, and obtusely four-sided in the\r\n    Downton Square nut.\r\n\r\n    _Cucurbitaceous plants._--These plants have been for a long period the\r\n    opprobrium of botanists; numerous varieties have been ranked as\r\n    species, and, what happens more rarely, forms which now must be\r\n    considered as species have been classed as varieties. Owing to the\r\n    admirable experimental researches of a distinguished botanist, M.\r\n    Naudin,[750] a flood of light has recently been thrown on this group of\r\n    plants. M. Naudin, during many years, observed and experimented on\r\n    above 1200 living specimens, collected from all quarters of the world.\r\n    Six species are now recognised in the genus Cucurbita; but three alone\r\n    have been cultivated and concern us, namely, _C. maxima_ and _pepo_,\r\n    which include all pumpkins, gourds, squashes, and vegetable marrow, and\r\n    _C. moschata_, the water-melon. These three species are not known in a\r\n    wild state; but Asa Gray[751] gives good reason for believing that some\r\n    pumpkins are natives of N. America.\r\n\r\n    These three species are closely allied, and have the same general\r\n    habit, but their innumerable varieties can always be distinguished,\r\n    according to Naudin, by certain almost fixed characters; and what is\r\n    still more important, when crossed they yield no seed, or only sterile\r\n    seed; whilst the varieties spontaneously intercross with the utmost\r\n    freedom. Naudin insists strongly (p. 15), that, though these three\r\n    species have varied greatly in many characters, yet it has been in so\r\n    closely an analogous manner that the varieties can be arranged in\r\n    almost parallel series, as we have seen with the forms of wheat, with\r\n    the two main races of the peach, and in other cases. Though some of the\r\n    varieties are inconstant in character, yet others, when grown\r\n    separately under uniform conditions of life, are, as Naudin repeatedly\r\n    (pp. 6, 16, 35) urges, \"douées d'une stabilité {358} presque comparable\r\n    à celle des espèces les mieux caractérisées.\" One variety, l'Orangin\r\n    (pp. 43, 63), has such prepotency in transmitting its character that\r\n    when crossed with other varieties a vast majority of the seedlings come\r\n    true. Naudin, referring (p. 47) to _C. pepo_, says that its races \"ne\r\n    diffèrent des espèces véritables qu'en ce qu'elles peuvent s'allier les\r\n    unes aux autres par voie d'hybridité, sans que leur descendance perde\r\n    la faculté de se perpétuer.\" If we were to trust to external\r\n    differences alone, and give up the test of sterility, a multitude of\r\n    species would have to be formed out of the varieties of these three\r\n    species of Cucurbita. Many naturalists at the present day lay far too\r\n    little stress, in my opinion, on the test of sterility; yet it is not\r\n    improbable that distinct species of plants after a long course of\r\n    cultivation and variation may have their mutual sterility eliminated,\r\n    as we have every reason to believe has occurred with domesticated\r\n    animals. Nor, in the case of plants under cultivation, should we be\r\n    justified in assuming that varieties never acquire a slight degree of\r\n    mutual sterility, as we shall more fully see in a future chapter when\r\n    certain facts are given on the high authority of Gärtner and\r\n    Kölreuter.[752]\r\n\r\n    The forms of _C. pepo_ are classed by Naudin under seven sections, each\r\n    including subordinate varieties. He considers this plant as probably\r\n    the most variable in the world. The fruit of one variety (pp. 33, 46)\r\n    exceeds in volume that of another by more than two thousand fold! When\r\n    the fruit is of very large size, the number produced is few (p. 45);\r\n    when of small size, many are produced. No less astonishing (p. 33) is\r\n    the variation in the shape of the fruit; the typical form apparently is\r\n    egg-like, but this becomes either drawn out into a cylinder, or\r\n    shortened into a flat disc. We have also an almost infinite diversity\r\n    in the colour and state of surface of the fruit, in the hardness both\r\n    of the shell and of the flesh, and in the taste of the flesh, which is\r\n    either extremely sweet, farinaceous, or slightly bitter. The seeds also\r\n    differ in a slight degree in shape, and wonderfully in size (p. 34),\r\n    namely, from six or seven to more than twenty-five millimètres in\r\n    length.\r\n\r\n    In the varieties which grow upright or do not run and climb, the\r\n    tendrils, though useless (p. 31), are either present or are represented\r\n    by various semi-monstrous organs, or are quite absent. The tendrils are\r\n    even absent in some running varieties in which the stems are much\r\n    elongated. It is a singular fact that (p. 31), in all the varieties\r\n    with dwarfed stems, the leaves closely resemble each other in shape.\r\n\r\n    Those naturalists who believe in the immutability of species often\r\n    maintain that, even in the most variable forms, the characters which\r\n    they consider of specific value are unchangeable. To give an example\r\n    from a conscientious writer,[753] who, relying on the labours of M.\r\n    Naudin and {359} referring to the species of Cucurbita, says, \"au\r\n    milieu de toutes les variations du fruit, les tiges, les feuilles, les\r\n    calices, les corolles, les étamines restent invariables dans chacune\r\n    d'elles.\" Yet M. Naudin in describing _Cucurbita pepo_ (p. 30) says,\r\n    \"Ici, d'ailleurs, ce ne sont pas seulement les fruits qui varient,\r\n    c'est aussi le feuillage et tout le port de la plante. Néanmoins, je\r\n    crois qu'on la distinguera toujours facilement des deux autres espèces,\r\n    si l'on veut ne pas perdre de vue les caractères différentiels que je\r\n    m'efforce de faire ressortir. Ces caractères sont quelquefois peu\r\n    marqués: il arrive même que plusieurs d'entre eux s'effacent presque\r\n    entièrement, mais il en reste toujours quelques-uns qui remettent\r\n    l'observateur sur la voie.\" Now let it be noted what a difference, with\r\n    regard to the immutability of the so-called specific characters, this\r\n    paragraph produces on the mind, from that above quoted from M. Godron.\r\n\r\n    I will add another remark: naturalists continually assert that no\r\n    important organ varies; but in saying this they unconsciously argue in\r\n    a vicious circle; for if an organ, let it be what it may, is highly\r\n    variable, it is regarded as unimportant, and under a systematic point\r\n    of view this is quite correct. But as long as constancy is thus taken\r\n    as the criterion of importance, it will indeed be long before an\r\n    important organ can be shown to be inconstant. The enlarged form of the\r\n    stigmas, and their sessile position on the summit of the ovary, must be\r\n    considered as important characters, and were used by Gasparini to\r\n    separate certain pumpkins as a _distinct genus_; but Naudin says (p.\r\n    20) these parts have no constancy, and in the flowers of the Turban\r\n    varieties of _C. maxima_ they sometimes resume their ordinary\r\n    structure. Again, in _C. maxima_, the carpels (p. 19) which form the\r\n    Turban project even as much as two-thirds of their length out of the\r\n    receptacle, and this latter part is thus reduced to a sort of platform;\r\n    but this remarkable structure occurs only in certain varieties, and\r\n    graduates into the common form in which the carpels are almost entirely\r\n    enveloped within the receptacle. In _C. moschata_ the ovarium (p. 50)\r\n    varies greatly in shape, being oval, nearly spherical, or cylindrical,\r\n    more or less swollen in the upper part, or constricted round the\r\n    middle, and either straight or curved. When the ovarium is short and\r\n    oval the interior structure does not differ from that of _C. maxima_\r\n    and _pepo_, but when it is elongated the carpels occupy only the\r\n    terminal and swollen portion. I may add that in one variety of the\r\n    cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_) the fruit regularly contains five carpels\r\n    instead of three.[754] I presume that it will not be disputed that we\r\n    here have instances of great variability in organs of the highest\r\n    physiological importance, and with most plants of the highest\r\n    classificatory importance.\r\n\r\n    Sageret[755] and Naudin found that the cucumber (_C. sativus_) could\r\n    not be crossed with any other species of the genus; therefore no doubt\r\n    it is specifically distinct from the melon. This will appear to most\r\n    persons a superfluous statement; yet we hear from Naudin[756] that\r\n    there is a race {360} of melons, in which the fruit is so like that of\r\n    the cucumber, \"both externally and internally, that it is hardly\r\n    possible to distinguish the one from the other except by the leaves.\"\r\n    The varieties of the melon seem to be endless, for Naudin after six\r\n    years' study has not come to the end of them: he divides them into ten\r\n    sections, including numerous sub-varieties which all intercross with\r\n    perfect ease.[757] Of the forms considered by Naudin to be varieties,\r\n    botanists have made thirty distinct species! \"and they had not the\r\n    slightest acquaintance with the multitude of new forms which have\r\n    appeared since their time.\" Nor is the creation of so many species at\r\n    all surprising when we consider how strictly their characters are\r\n    transmitted by seed, and how wonderfully they differ in appearance:\r\n    \"Mira est quidem foliorum et habitus diversitas, sed multo magis\r\n    fructuum,\" says Naudin. The fruit is the valuable part, and this, in\r\n    accordance with the common rule, is the most modified part. Some melons\r\n    are only as large as small plums, others weigh as much as sixty-six\r\n    pounds. One variety has a scarlet fruit! Another is not more than an\r\n    inch in diameter, but sometimes more than a yard in length, \"twisting\r\n    about in all directions like a serpent.\" It is a singular fact that in\r\n    this latter variety many parts of the plant, namely, the stems, the\r\n    footstalks of the female flowers, the middle lobe of the leaves, and\r\n    especially the ovarium, as well as the mature fruit, all show a strong\r\n    tendency to become elongated. Several varieties of the melon are\r\n    interesting from assuming the characteristic features of distinct\r\n    species and even of distinct though allied genera: thus the\r\n    serpent-melon has some resemblance to the fruit of _Trichosanthes\r\n    anguina_; we have seen that other varieties closely resemble cucumbers;\r\n    some Egyptian varieties have their seeds attached to a portion of the\r\n    pulp, and this is characteristic of certain wild forms. Lastly, a\r\n    variety of melon from Algiers is remarkable from announcing its\r\n    maturity by \"a spontaneous and almost sudden dislocation,\" when deep\r\n    cracks suddenly appear, and the fruit falls to pieces; and this occurs\r\n    with the wild _C. momordica_. Finally, M. Naudin well remarks that this\r\n    \"extraordinary production of races and varieties by a single species,\r\n    and their permanence when not interfered with by crossing, are\r\n    phenomena well calculated to cause reflection.\"\r\n\r\n    USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL TREES.\r\n\r\n    Trees deserve a passing notice on account of the numerous varieties\r\n    which they present, differing in their precocity, in their manner of\r\n    growth, foliage, and bark. Thus of the common ash (_Fraxinus\r\n    excelsior_) the catalogue of Messrs. Lawson of Edinburgh includes\r\n    twenty-one varieties, some of which differ much in their bark; there is\r\n    a yellow, a streaked reddish-white, a purple, a wart-barked and a\r\n    fungous-barked variety.[758] Of hollies no less than eighty-four\r\n    varieties are grown alongside each other in Mr. {361} Paul's\r\n    nursery.[759] In the case of trees, all the recorded varieties, as far\r\n    as I can find out, have been suddenly produced by one single act of\r\n    variation. The length of time required to raise many generations, and\r\n    the little value set on the fanciful varieties, explains how it is that\r\n    successive modifications have not been accumulated by selection; hence,\r\n    also it follows that we do not here meet with sub-varieties subordinate\r\n    to varieties, and these again subordinate to higher groups. On the\r\n    Continent, however, where the forests are more carefully attended to\r\n    than in England, Alph. De Candolle[760] says that there is not a\r\n    forester who does not search for seeds from that variety which he\r\n    esteems the most valuable.\r\n\r\n    Our useful trees have seldom been exposed to any great change of\r\n    conditions; they have not been richly manured, and the English kinds\r\n    grow under their proper climate. Yet in examining extensive beds of\r\n    seedlings in nursery-gardens considerable differences may be generally\r\n    observed in them; and whilst touring in England I have been surprised\r\n    at the amount of difference in the appearance of the same species in\r\n    our hedgerows and woods. But as plants vary so much in a truly wild\r\n    state, it would be difficult for even a skilful botanist to pronounce\r\n    whether, as I believe to be the case, hedgerow trees vary more than\r\n    those growing in a primeval forest. Trees when planted by man in woods\r\n    or hedges do not grow where they would naturally be able to hold their\r\n    place against a host of competitors, and are therefore exposed to\r\n    conditions not strictly natural: even this slight change would probably\r\n    suffice to cause seedlings raised from such trees to be variable.\r\n    Whether or not our half-wild English trees, as a general rule, are more\r\n    variable than trees growing in their native forests, there can hardly\r\n    be a doubt that they have yielded a greater number of strongly-marked\r\n    and singular variations of structure.\r\n\r\n    In manner of growth, we have weeping or pendulous varieties of the\r\n    willow, ash, elm, oak, and yew, and other trees; and this weeping habit\r\n    is sometimes inherited, though in a singularly capricious manner. In\r\n    the Lombardy poplar, and in certain fastigate or pyramidal varieties of\r\n    thorns, junipers, oaks, &c., we have an opposite kind of growth. The\r\n    Hessian oak,[761] which is famous from its fastigate habit and size,\r\n    bears hardly any resemblance in general appearance to a common oak;\r\n    \"its acorns are not sure to produce plants of the same habit; some,\r\n    however, turn out the same as the parent-tree.\" Another fastigate oak\r\n    is said to have been found wild in the Pyrenees, and this is a\r\n    surprising circumstance; it generally comes so true by seed, that De\r\n    Candolle considered it as specifically distinct.[762] The fastigate\r\n    Juniper (_J. suecica_) likewise transmits its character by seed.[763]\r\n    Dr. Falconer informs me that in the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta the\r\n    great heat causes apple-trees to become fastigate; and we {362} thus\r\n    see the same result following from the effects of climate and from an\r\n    innate spontaneous tendency.[764]\r\n\r\n    In foliage we have variegated leaves which are often inherited; dark\r\n    purple or red leaves, as in the hazel, barberry, and beech, the colour\r\n    in these two latter trees being sometimes strongly and sometimes weakly\r\n    inherited;[765] deeply-cut leaves; and leaves covered with prickles, as\r\n    in the variety of the holly well called _ferox_, which is said to\r\n    reproduce itself by seed.[766] In fact, nearly all the peculiar\r\n    varieties evince a tendency, more or less strongly marked, to reproduce\r\n    themselves by seed.[767] This is to a certain extent the case,\r\n    according to Bose,[768] with three varieties of the elm, namely, the\r\n    broad-leafed, lime-leafed, and twisted elm, in which latter the fibres\r\n    of the wood are twisted. Even with the heterophyllous hornbeam\r\n    (_Carpinus betulus_), which bears on each twig leaves of two shapes,\r\n    \"several plants raised from seed all retained the same\r\n    peculiarity.\"[769] I will add only one other remarkable case of\r\n    variation in foliage, namely, the occurrence of two sub-varieties of\r\n    the ash with simple instead of pinnated leaves, and which generally\r\n    transmit their character by seed.[770] The occurrence, in trees\r\n    belonging to widely different orders, of weeping and fastigate\r\n    varieties, and of trees bearing deeply cut, variegated, and purple\r\n    leaves, shows that these deviations of structure must result from some\r\n    very general physiological laws.\r\n\r\n    Differences in general appearance and foliage, not more strongly marked\r\n    than those above indicated, have led good observers to rank as distinct\r\n    species certain forms which are now known to be mere varieties. Thus a\r\n    plane-tree long cultivated in England was considered by almost every\r\n    one as a North American species; but is now ascertained by old records,\r\n    as I am informed by Dr. Hooker, to be a variety. So again the _Thuja\r\n    pendula_ or _filiformis_ was ranked by such good observers as Lambert,\r\n    Wallich, and others as a true species; but it is now known that the\r\n    original plants, five in number, suddenly appeared in a bed of\r\n    seedlings, raised at Mr. Loddige's nursery, from _T. orientalis_; and\r\n    Dr. Hooker has adduced excellent evidence that at Turin seeds of _T.\r\n    pendula_ have reproduced the parent-form, _T. orientalis_.[771]\r\n\r\n    Every one must have noticed how certain individual trees regularly put\r\n    forth and shed their leaves earlier or later than others of the same\r\n    species. There is a famous horse-chesnut in the Tuileries which is\r\n    named from {363} leafing so much earlier than the others. There is also\r\n    an oak near Edinburgh which retains its leaves to a very late period.\r\n    These differences have been attributed by some authors to the nature of\r\n    the soil in which the trees grow; but Archbishop Whately grafted an\r\n    early thorn on a late one, and _vice versâ_, and both grafts kept to\r\n    their proper periods, which differed by about a fortnight, as if they\r\n    still grew on their own stocks.[772] There is a Cornish variety of the\r\n    elm which is almost an evergreen, and is so tender that the shoots are\r\n    often killed by the frost; and the varieties of the Turkish oak (_Q.\r\n    cerris_) may be arranged as deciduous, sub-evergreen, and\r\n    evergreen.[773]\r\n\r\n    _Scotch Fir_ (_Pinus sylvestris_).--I allude to this tree as it bears\r\n    on the question of the greater variability of our hedgerow trees\r\n    compared with those under strictly natural conditions. A well-informed\r\n    writer[774] states that the Scotch fir presents few varieties in its\r\n    native Scotch forests; but that it \"varies much in figure and foliage,\r\n    and in the size, shape, and colour of its cones, when several\r\n    generations have been produced away from its native locality.\" There is\r\n    little doubt that the highland and lowland varieties differ in the\r\n    value of their timber, and that they can be propagated truly by seed;\r\n    thus justifying Loudon's remark, that \"a variety is often of as much\r\n    importance as a species, and sometimes far more so.\"[775] I may mention\r\n    one rather important point in which this tree occasionally varies; in\r\n    the classification of the Coniferæ, sections are founded on whether\r\n    two, three, or five leaves are included in the same sheath; the Scotch\r\n    fir has properly only two leaves thus enclosed, but specimens have been\r\n    observed with groups of three leaves in a sheath.[776] Besides these\r\n    differences in the semi-cultivated Scotch fir, there are in several\r\n    parts of Europe natural or geographical races, which have been ranked\r\n    by some authors as distinct species.[777] Loudon[778] considers _P.\r\n    pumilio_, with its several sub-varieties, as _Mughus_, _nana_, &c.,\r\n    which differ much when planted in different soils and only come\r\n    \"tolerably true from seed,\" as alpine varieties of the Scotch fir; if\r\n    this were proved to be the case, it would be an interesting fact as\r\n    showing that dwarfing from long exposure to a severe climate is to a\r\n    certain extent inherited.\r\n\r\n    The _Hawthorn_ (_Cratægus oxycantha_) has varied much. Besides endless\r\n    slighter variations in the form of the leaves, and in the size,\r\n    hardness, fleshiness, and shape of the berries, Loudon[779] enumerates\r\n    twenty-nine well-marked varieties. Besides those cultivated for their\r\n    pretty flowers, there are others with golden-yellow, black, and whitish\r\n    berries; others {364} with woolly berries, and others with recurved\r\n    thorns. Loudon truly remarks that the chief reason why the hawthorn has\r\n    yielded more varieties than most other trees, is that curious\r\n    nurserymen select any remarkable variety out of the immense beds of\r\n    seedlings which are annually raised for making hedges. The flowers of\r\n    the hawthorn usually include from one to three pistils; but in two\r\n    varieties, named _Monogyna_ and _Sibirica_, there is only a single\r\n    pistil; and d'Asso states that the common thorn in Spain is constantly\r\n    in this state.[780] There is also a variety which is apetalous, or has\r\n    its petals reduced to mere rudiments. The famous Glastonbury thorn\r\n    flowers and leafs towards the end of December, at which time it bears\r\n    berries produced from an earlier crop of flowers.[781] It is worth\r\n    notice that several varieties of the hawthorn, as well as of the lime\r\n    and juniper, are very distinct in their foliage and habit whilst young,\r\n    but in the course of thirty or forty years become extremely like each\r\n    other;[782] thus reminding us of the well-known fact that the deodar,\r\n    the cedar of Lebanon, and that of the Atlas, are distinguished with the\r\n    greatest ease whilst young, but with difficulty when old.\r\n\r\n    FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n    I shall not for several reasons treat the variability of plants which\r\n    are cultivated for their flowers alone at any great length. Many of our\r\n    favourite kinds in their present state are the descendants of two or\r\n    more species crossed and commingled together, and this circumstance\r\n    alone would render it difficult to detect the differences due to\r\n    variation. For instance, our Roses, Petunias, Calceolarias, Fuchsias,\r\n    Verbenas, Gladioli, Pelargoniums, &c., certainly have had a multiple\r\n    origin. A botanist well acquainted with the parent-forms would probably\r\n    detect some curious structural differences in their crossed and\r\n    cultivated descendant; and he would certainly observe many new and\r\n    remarkable constitutional peculiarities. I will give a few instances,\r\n    all relating to the Pelargonium, and taken chiefly from Mr. Beck,[783]\r\n    a famous cultivator of this plant: some varieties require more water\r\n    than others; some are \"very impatient of the knife if too greedily used\r\n    in making cuttings;\" some, when potted, scarcely \"show a root at the\r\n    outside of the ball of the earth;\" one variety requires a certain\r\n    amount of confinement in the pot to make it throw up a flower-stem;\r\n    some varieties bloom well at the commencement of the season, others at\r\n    the close; one variety is known,[784] which will stand \"even pine-apple\r\n    top and bottom heat, without looking any more drawn than if it had\r\n    stood in a common greenhouse; and Blanche Fleur seems as if made on\r\n    purpose for growing in winter, like many bulbs, and to rest all\r\n    summer.\" These odd constitutional peculiarities would fit a plant when\r\n    growing in a state of nature for widely different circumstances and\r\n    climates.\r\n\r\n    {365}\r\n\r\n    Flowers possess little interest under our present point of view,\r\n    because they have been almost exclusively attended to and selected for\r\n    their beautiful colours, size, perfect outline, and manner of growth.\r\n    In these particulars hardly one long-cultivated flower can be named\r\n    which has not varied greatly. What does a florist care for the shape\r\n    and structure of the organs of fructification, unless, indeed, they add\r\n    to the beauty of the flower? When this is the case, flowers become\r\n    modified in important points; stamens and pistils may be converted into\r\n    petals, and additional petals may be developed, as in all double\r\n    flowers. The process of gradual selection by which flowers have been\r\n    rendered more and more double, each step in the process of conversion\r\n    being inherited, has been recorded in several instances. In the\r\n    so-called double flowers of the Compositæ, the corollas of the central\r\n    florets are greatly modified, and the modifications are likewise\r\n    inherited. In the columbine _(Aquilegia vulgaris)_ some of the stamens\r\n    are converted into petals having the shape of nectaries, one neatly\r\n    fitting into the other; but in one variety they are converted into\r\n    simple petals.[785] In the hose and hose primulæ, the calyx becomes\r\n    brightly coloured and enlarged so as to resemble a corolla; and Mr. W.\r\n    Wooler informs me that this peculiarity is transmitted; for he crossed\r\n    a common polyanthus with one having a coloured calyx,[786] and some of\r\n    the seedlings inherited the coloured calyx during at least six\r\n    generations. In the \"hen-and-chicken\" daisy the main flower is\r\n    surrounded by a brood of small flowers developed from buds in the axils\r\n    of the scales of the involucre. A wonderful poppy has been described,\r\n    in which the stamens are converted into pistils; and so strictly was\r\n    this peculiarity inherited that, out of 154 seedlings, one alone\r\n    reverted to the ordinary and common type.[787] Of the cock's-comb\r\n    (_Celosia cristata_), which is an annual, there are several races in\r\n    which the flower-stem is wonderfully \"fasciated\" or compressed; and one\r\n    has been exhibited[788] actually eighteen inches in breadth. Peloric\r\n    races of _Gloxinia speciosa_ and _Antirrhinum majus_ can be propagated\r\n    by seed, and they differ in a wonderful manner from the typical form\r\n    both in structure and appearance.\r\n\r\n    A much more remarkable modification has been recorded by Sir William\r\n    and Dr. Hooker[789] in _Begonia frigida_. This plant properly produces\r\n    male and female flowers on the same fascicles; and in the female\r\n    flowers the perianth is superior; but a plant at Kew produced, besides\r\n    the ordinary flowers, others which graduated towards a perfect\r\n    hermaphrodite structure; and in these flowers the perianth was\r\n    inferior. To show the importance of this modification under a\r\n    classificatory point of view, I may quote what Prof. Harvey says,\r\n    namely, that had it \"occurred in a state of nature, and had a botanist\r\n    collected a plant with such flowers, he would not only have {366}\r\n    placed it in a distinct genus from Begonia, but would probably have\r\n    considered it as the type of a new natural order.\" This modification\r\n    cannot in one sense be considered as a monstrosity, for analogous\r\n    structures naturally occur in other orders, as with Saxifragas and\r\n    Aristolochiaceæ. The interest of the case is largely added to by Mr. C.\r\n    W. Crocker's observation that seedlings from the _normal_ flowers\r\n    produced plants which bore, in about the same proportion as the\r\n    parent-plant, hermaphrodite flowers having inferior perianths. The\r\n    hermaphrodite flowers fertilised with their own pollen were sterile.\r\n\r\n    If florists had attended to, selected, and propagated by seed other\r\n    modifications of structure besides those which are beautiful, a host of\r\n    curious varieties would certainly have been raised; and they would\r\n    probably have transmitted their characters so truly that the cultivator\r\n    would have felt aggrieved, as in the case of culinary vegetables, if\r\n    his whole bed had not presented a uniform appearance. Florists have\r\n    attended in some instances to the leaves of their plant, and have thus\r\n    produced the most elegant and symmetrical patterns of white, red, and\r\n    green, which, as in the case of the pelargonium, are sometimes strictly\r\n    inherited.[790] Any one who will habitually examine highly-cultivated\r\n    flowers in gardens and greenhouses will observe numerous deviations in\r\n    structure; but most of these must be ranked as mere monstrosities, and\r\n    are only so far interesting as showing how plastic the organisation\r\n    becomes under high cultivation. From this point of view such works as\r\n    Professor Moquin-Tandon's 'Tératologie' are highly instructive.\r\n\r\n    _Roses._--These flowers offer an instance of a number of forms\r\n    generally ranked as species, namely, _R. centifolia_, _gallica_,\r\n    _alba_, _damascena_, _spinosissima_, _bracteata_, _Indica_,\r\n    _semperflorens_, _moschata_, &c., which have largely varied and been\r\n    intercrossed. The genus Rosa is a notoriously difficult one, and,\r\n    though some of the above forms are admitted by all botanists to be\r\n    distinct species, others are doubtful; thus, with respect to the\r\n    British forms, Babington makes seventeen, and Bentham only five\r\n    species. The hybrids from some of the most distinct forms--for\r\n    instance, from _R. Indica_, fertilised by the pollen of _R.\r\n    centifolia_--produce an abundance of seed; I state this on the\r\n    authority of Mr. Rivers,[791] from whose work I have drawn most of the\r\n    following statements. As almost all the aboriginal forms brought from\r\n    different countries have been crossed and recrossed, it is no wonder\r\n    that Targioni-Tozzetti, in speaking of the common roses of the Italian\r\n    gardens, remarks that \"the native country and precise form of the wild\r\n    type of most of them are involved in much uncertainty.\"[792]\r\n    Nevertheless Mr. Rivers in referring to _R. Indica_ (p. 68) says that\r\n    the descendants of each group may generally be recognised by a close\r\n    observer. The same author often speaks of roses as having been a little\r\n    hybridised; but {367} it is evident that in very many cases the\r\n    differences due to variation and to hybridisation can now only be\r\n    conjecturally distinguished.\r\n\r\n    The species have varied both by seed and by buds; such modified buds\r\n    being often called by gardeners sports. In the following chapter I\r\n    shall fully discuss this latter subject, and shall show that\r\n    bud-variations can be propagated not only by grafting and budding, but\r\n    often even by seed. Whenever a new rose appears with any peculiar\r\n    character, however produced, if it yields seed, Mr. Rivers (p. 4) fully\r\n    expects it to become the parent-type of a new family. The tendency to\r\n    vary is so strong in some kinds, as in the Village Maid (Rivers, p.\r\n    16), that when grown in different soils it varies so much in colour\r\n    that it has been thought to form several distinct kinds. Altogether the\r\n    number of kinds is very great: thus M. Desportes, in his Catalogue for\r\n    1829, enumerates 2562 as cultivated in France; but no doubt a large\r\n    proportion of these are merely nominal.\r\n\r\n    It would be useless to specify the many points of difference between\r\n    the various kinds, but some constitutional peculiarities may be\r\n    mentioned. Several French roses (Rivers, p. 12) will not succeed in\r\n    England; and an excellent horticulturist[793] remarks, that \"Even in\r\n    the same garden you will find that a rose that will do nothing under a\r\n    south wall will do well under a north one. That is the case with Paul\r\n    Joseph here. It grows strongly and blooms beautifully close to a north\r\n    wall. For three years seven plants have done nothing under a south\r\n    wall.\" Many roses can be forced, \"many are totally unfit for forcing,\r\n    among which is General Jacqueminot.\"[794] From the effects of crossing\r\n    and variation Mr. Rivers enthusiastically anticipates (p. 87) that the\r\n    day will come when all our roses, even moss-roses, will have evergreen\r\n    foliage, brilliant and fragrant flowers, and the habit of blooming from\r\n    June till November. \"A distant view this seems, but perseverance in\r\n    gardening will yet achieve wonders,\" as assuredly it has already\r\n    achieved wonders.\r\n\r\n    It may be worth while briefly to give the well-known history of one\r\n    class of roses. In 1793 some wild Scotch roses (_R. spinosissima_) were\r\n    transplanted into a garden;[795] and one of these bore flowers slightly\r\n    tinged with red, from which a plant was raised with semi-monstrous\r\n    flowers, also tinged with red; seedlings from this flower were\r\n    semi-double, and by continued selection, in about nine or ten years,\r\n    eight sub-varieties were raised. In the course of less than twenty\r\n    years these double Scotch roses had so much increased in number and\r\n    kind, that twenty-six well-marked varieties, classed in eight sections,\r\n    were described by Mr. Sabine. In 1841[796] it is said that three\r\n    hundred varieties could be procured in the nursery-gardens near\r\n    Glasgow; and these are described as blush, crimson, purple, red,\r\n    marbled, two-coloured, white, and yellow, and as differing much in the\r\n    size and shape of the flower.\r\n\r\n    {368}\r\n\r\n    _Pansy or Heartsease_ (_Viola tricolor_, &c.).--The history of this\r\n    flower seems to be pretty well known; it was grown in Evelyn's garden\r\n    in 1687; but the varieties were not attended to till 1810-1812, when\r\n    Lady Monke, together with Mr. Lee the well-known nurseryman,\r\n    energetically commenced their culture; and in the course of a few years\r\n    twenty varieties could be purchased.[797] At about the same period,\r\n    namely in 1813 or 1814, Lord Gambier collected some wild plants, and\r\n    his gardener, Mr. Thomson, cultivated them together with some common\r\n    garden varieties, and soon effected a great improvement. The first\r\n    great change was the conversion of the dark lines in the centre of the\r\n    flower into a dark eye or centre, which at that period had never been\r\n    seen, but is now considered one of the chief requisites of a first-rate\r\n    flower. In 1835 a book entirely devoted to this flower was published,\r\n    and four hundred named varieties were on sale. From these circumstances\r\n    this plant seemed to me worth studying, more especially from the great\r\n    contrast between the small, dull, elongated, irregular flowers of the\r\n    wild pansy, and the beautiful, flat, symmetrical, circular, velvet-like\r\n    flowers, more than two inches in diameter, magnificently and variously\r\n    coloured, which are exhibited at our shows. But when I came to inquire\r\n    more closely, I found that, though the varieties were so modern, yet\r\n    that much confusion and doubt prevailed about their parentage. Florists\r\n    believe that the varieties[798] are descended from several wild stocks,\r\n    namely, _V. tricolor_, _lutea_, _grandiflora_, _amoena_, and _Altaica_,\r\n    more or less intercrossed. And when I looked to botanical works to\r\n    ascertain whether these forms ought to be ranked as species, I found\r\n    equal doubt and confusion. _Viola Altaica_ seems to be a distinct form,\r\n    but what part it has played in the origin of our varieties I know not;\r\n    it is said to have been crossed with _V. lutea_. _Viola amoena_[799] is\r\n    now looked at by all botanists as a natural variety of _V.\r\n    grandiflora_; and this and _V. sudetica_ have been proved to be\r\n    identical with _V. lutea_. The latter and _V. tricolor_ (including its\r\n    admitted variety _V. arvensis_) are ranked as distinct species by\r\n    Babington; and likewise by M. Gay,[800] who has paid particular\r\n    attention to the genus; but the specific distinction between _V. lutea_\r\n    and _tricolor_ is chiefly grounded on the one being strictly and the\r\n    other not strictly perennial, as well as on some other slight and\r\n    unimportant differences in the form of the stem and stipules. Bentham\r\n    unites these two forms; and a high authority on such matters, Mr. H. C.\r\n    Watson,[801] says that, \"while _V. tricolor_ passes into _V. arvensis_\r\n    on the one side, it approximates so much towards _V. lutea_ and _V.\r\n    Curtisii_ on the other side, that a distinction becomes scarcely more\r\n    easy between them.\"\r\n\r\n    {369}\r\n\r\n    Hence, after having carefully compared numerous varieties, I gave up\r\n    the attempt as too difficult for any one except a professed botanist.\r\n    Most of the varieties present such inconstant characters, that when\r\n    grown in poor soil, or when flowering out of their proper season, they\r\n    produce differently coloured and much smaller flowers. Cultivators\r\n    speak of this or that kind as being remarkably constant or true; but by\r\n    this they do not mean, as in other cases, that the kind transmits its\r\n    character by seed, but that the individual plant does not change much\r\n    under culture. The principle of inheritance, however, does hold good to\r\n    a certain extent even with the fleeting varieties of the Heartease, for\r\n    to gain good sorts it is indispensable to sow the seed of good sorts.\r\n    Nevertheless in every large seed-bed a few almost wild seedlings often\r\n    reappear through reversion. On comparing the choicest varieties with\r\n    the nearest allied wild forms, besides the difference in the size,\r\n    outline, and colour of the flowers, the leaves are seen sometimes to\r\n    differ in shape, as does the calyx occasionally in the length and\r\n    breadth of the sepals. The differences in the form of the nectary more\r\n    especially deserve notice; because characters derived from this organ\r\n    have been much used in the discrimination of most of the species of\r\n    Viola. In a large number of flowers compared in 1842 I found that in\r\n    the greater number the nectary was straight; in others the extremity\r\n    was a little turned upwards, or downwards, or inwards, so as to be\r\n    completely hooked; in others, instead of being hooked, it was first\r\n    turned rectangularly downwards, and then backwards and upwards; in\r\n    others the extremity was considerably enlarged; and lastly, in some the\r\n    basal part was depressed, becoming, as usual, laterally compressed\r\n    towards the extremity. In a large number of flowers, on the other hand,\r\n    examined by me in 1856 from a nursery-garden in a different part of\r\n    England, the nectary hardly varied at all. Now M. Gay says that in\r\n    certain districts, especially in Auvergne, the nectary of the wild _V.\r\n    grandiflora_ varies in the manner just described. Must we conclude from\r\n    this that the cultivated varieties first mentioned were all descended\r\n    from _V. grandiflora_, and that the second lot, though having the same\r\n    general appearance, were descended from _V. tricolor_, of which the\r\n    nectary, according to M. Gay, is subject to little variation? Or is it\r\n    not more probable that both these wild forms would be found under other\r\n    conditions to vary in the same manner and degree, thus showing that\r\n    they ought not to be ranked as specifically distinct?\r\n\r\n    The _Dahlia_ has been referred to by almost every author who has\r\n    written on the variation of plants, because it is believed that all the\r\n    varieties are descended from a single species, and because all have\r\n    arisen since 1802 in France, and since 1804 in England.[802] Mr. Sabine\r\n    remarks that \"it seems as if some period of cultivation had been\r\n    required before the fixed qualities of the native plant gave way and\r\n    began to sport into those changes which now so delight us.\"[803] The\r\n    flowers have been greatly modified in shape from a flat to a globular\r\n    form. Anemone and {370} ranunculus-like races,[804] which differ in the\r\n    form and arrangement of the florets, have arisen; also dwarfed races,\r\n    one of which is only eighteen inches in height. The seeds vary much in\r\n    size. The petals are uniformly coloured or tipped or striped, and\r\n    present an almost infinite diversity of tints. Seedlings of fourteen\r\n    different colours[805] have been raised from the same plant; yet, as\r\n    Mr. Sabine has remarked, \"many of the seedlings follow their parents in\r\n    colour.\" The period of flowering has been considerably hastened, and\r\n    this has probably been effected by continued selection. Salisbury,\r\n    writing 1808, says that they then flowered from September to November;\r\n    in 1828 some new dwarf varieties began flowering in June;[806] and Mr.\r\n    Grieve informs me that the dwarf purple Zelinda in his garden is in\r\n    full bloom by the middle of June and sometimes even earlier. Slight\r\n    constitutional differences have been observed between certain\r\n    varieties: thus, some kinds succeed much better in one part of England\r\n    than in another;[807] and it has been noticed that some varieties\r\n    require much more moisture than others.[808]\r\n\r\n    Such flowers as the carnation, common tulip, and hyacinth, which are\r\n    believed to be descended, each from a single wild form, present\r\n    innumerable varieties, differing almost exclusively in the size, form,\r\n    and colour of the flowers. These and some other anciently cultivated\r\n    plants which have been long propagated by offsets, pipings, bulbs, &c.,\r\n    become so excessively variable, that almost each new plant raised from\r\n    seed forms a new variety, \"all of which to describe particularly,\" as\r\n    old Gerarde wrote in 1597, \"were to roll Sisyphus's stone, or to number\r\n    the sands.\"\r\n\r\n    _Hyacinth_ (_Hyacinthus orientalis_).--It may, however, be worth while\r\n    to give a short account of this plant, which was introduced into\r\n    England in 1596 from the Levant.[809] The petals of the original\r\n    flower, says Mr. Paul, were narrow, wrinkled, pointed, and of a flimsy\r\n    texture; now they are broad, smooth, solid, and rounded. The erectness,\r\n    breadth, and length of the whole spike, and the size of the flowers,\r\n    have all increased. The colours have been intensified and diversified.\r\n    Gerarde, in 1597, enumerates four, and Parkinson, in 1629, eight\r\n    varieties. Now the varieties are very numerous, and they were still\r\n    more numerous a century ago. Mr. Paul remarks that \"it is interesting\r\n    to compare the Hyacinths of 1629 with those of 1864, and to mark the\r\n    improvement. Two hundred and thirty-five years have elapsed since then,\r\n    and this simple flower serves well to illustrate the great fact that\r\n    the original forms of nature do not remain fixed and stationary, at\r\n    least when brought under cultivation. While looking at the extremes, we\r\n    must not however forget that there are intermediate stages which are\r\n    for the most part lost to us. Nature will {371} sometimes indulge\r\n    herself with a leap, but as a rule her march is slow and gradual.\" He\r\n    adds that the cultivator should have \"in his mind an ideal of beauty,\r\n    for the realisation of which he works with head and hand.\" We thus see\r\n    how clearly Mr. Paul, an eminently successful cultivator of this\r\n    flower, appreciates the action of methodical selection.\r\n\r\n    In a curious and apparently trustworthy treatise, published at\r\n    Amsterdam[810] in 1768, it is stated that nearly 2000 sorts were then\r\n    known; but in 1864 Mr. Paul found only 700 in the largest garden at\r\n    Haarlem. In this treatise it is said that not an instance is known of\r\n    any one variety reproducing itself truly by seed: the white kinds,\r\n    however, now[811] almost always yield white hyacinths, and the yellow\r\n    kinds come nearly true. The hyacinth is remarkable from having given\r\n    rise to varieties with bright blue, pink, and distinctly yellow\r\n    flowers. These three primary colours do not occur in the varieties of\r\n    any other species; nor do they often all occur even in the distinct\r\n    species of the same genus. Although the several kinds of hyacinths\r\n    differ but slightly from each other except in colour, yet each kind has\r\n    its own individual character, which can be recognised by a highly\r\n    educated eye; thus the writer of the Amsterdam treatise asserts (p. 43)\r\n    that some experienced florists, such as the famous G. Voorholm, seldom\r\n    failed in a collection of above twelve hundred sorts to recognise each\r\n    variety by the bulb alone! This same writer mentions some few singular\r\n    variations: for instance, the hyacinth commonly produces six leaves,\r\n    but there is one kind (p. 35) which scarcely ever has more than three\r\n    leaves; another never more than five; whilst others regularly produce\r\n    either seven or eight leaves. A variety, called la Coriphée, invariably\r\n    produces (p. 116) two flower-stems, united together and covered by one\r\n    skin. The flower-stem in another kind (p. 128) comes out of the ground\r\n    in a coloured sheath, before the appearance of the leaves, and is\r\n    consequently liable to suffer from frost. Another variety always pushes\r\n    a second flower-stem after the first has begun to develop itself.\r\n    Lastly, white hyacinths with red, purple, or violet centres (p. 129)\r\n    are the most liable to rot. Thus, the hyacinth, like so many previous\r\n    plants, when long cultivated and closely watched, is found to offer\r\n    many singular variations.\r\n\r\nIn the two last chapters I have given in some detail the range of\r\nvariation, and the history, as far as known, of a considerable number of\r\nplants, which have been cultivated for various purposes. But some of the\r\nmost variable plants, such as Kidney-beans, Capsicum, Millets, Sorghum,\r\n&c., have been passed over; for botanists are not agreed which kinds ought\r\nto rank as species and which as varieties; and the wild parent-species are\r\nunknown.[812] Many plants long cultivated in tropical {372} countries, such\r\nas the Banana, have produced numerous varieties; but as these have never\r\nbeen described with even moderate care, they also are here passed over.\r\nNevertheless a sufficient, and perhaps more than sufficient, number of\r\ncases have been given, so that the reader may be enabled to judge for\r\nhimself on the nature and extent of the variation which cultivated plants\r\nhave undergone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{373}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nON BUD-VARIATION, AND ON CERTAIN ANOMALOUS MODES OF REPRODUCTION AND\r\nVARIATION.\r\n\r\n    BUD-VARIATIONS IN THE PEACH, PLUM, CHERRY, VINE, GOOSEBERRY, CURRANT,\r\n    AND BANANA, AS SHOWN BY THE MODIFIED FRUIT--IN FLOWERS: CAMELLIAS,\r\n    AZALEAS, CHRYSANTHEMUMS, ROSES, ETC.--ON THE RUNNING OF THE COLOUR IN\r\n    CARNATIONS--BUD-VARIATIONS IN LEAVES--VARIATIONS BY SUCKERS, TUBERS,\r\n    AND BULBS--ON THE BREAKING OF TULIPS--BUD-VARIATIONS GRADUATE INTO\r\n    CHANGES CONSEQUENT ON CHANGED CONDITIONS OF LIFE--CYTISUS ADAMI, ITS\r\n    ORIGIN AND TRANSFORMATION--ON THE UNION OF TWO DIFFERENT EMBRYOS IN ONE\r\n    SEED--THE TRIFACIAL ORANGE--ON REVERSION BY BUDS IN HYBRIDS AND\r\n    MONGRELS--ON THE PRODUCTION OF MODIFIED BUDS BY THE GRAFTING OF ONE\r\n    VARIETY OR SPECIES ON ANOTHER--ON THE DIRECT OR IMMEDIATE ACTION OF\r\n    FOREIGN POLLEN ON THE MOTHER-PLANT--ON THE EFFECTS IN FEMALE ANIMALS OF\r\n    A FIRST IMPREGNATION ON THE SUBSEQUENT OFFSPRING--CONCLUSION AND\r\n    SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will be chiefly devoted to a subject in many respects\r\nimportant, namely, bud-variation. By this term I include all those sudden\r\nchanges in structure or appearance which occasionally occur in full-grown\r\nplants in their flower-buds or leaf-buds. Gardeners call such changes\r\n\"Sports;\" but this, as previously remarked, is an ill-defined expression,\r\nas it has often been applied to strongly marked variations in seedling\r\nplants. The difference between seminal and bud reproduction is not so great\r\nas it at first appears; for each bud is in one sense a new and distinct\r\nindividual; but such individuals are produced through the formation of\r\nvarious kinds of buds without the aid of any special apparatus, whilst\r\nfertile seeds are produced by the concourse of the two sexual elements. The\r\nmodifications which arise through bud-variation can generally be propagated\r\nto any extent by grafting, budding, cuttings, bulbs, &c., and occasionally\r\neven by seed. Some few of our most beautiful and useful productions have\r\narisen by bud-variation.\r\n\r\nBud-variations have as yet been observed only in the vegetable {374}\r\nkingdom; but it is probable that if compound animals, such as corals, &c.,\r\nhad been subjected to a long course of domestication, they would have\r\nvaried by buds; for they resemble plants in many respects. Thus any new or\r\npeculiar character presented by a compound animal is propagated by budding,\r\nas occurs with differently coloured Hydras, and as Mr. Gosse has shown to\r\nbe the case with a singular variety of a true coral. Varieties of the Hydra\r\nhave also been grafted on other varieties, and have retained their\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nI will in the first place give all the cases of bud-variations which I have\r\nbeen able to collect, and afterwards show their importance. These cases\r\nprove that those authors who, like Pallas, attribute all variability to the\r\ncrossing either of distinct races, or of individuals belonging to the same\r\nrace but somewhat different from each other, are in error; as are those\r\nauthors who attribute all variability to the mere act of sexual union. Nor\r\ncan we account in all cases for the appearance through bud-variation of new\r\ncharacters by the principle of reversion to long-lost characters. He who\r\nwishes to judge how far the conditions of life directly cause each\r\nparticular variation ought to reflect well on the cases immediately to be\r\ngiven. I will commence with bud-variations, as exhibited in the fruit, and\r\nthen pass on to flowers, and finally to leaves.\r\n\r\n    _Peach_ (_Amygdalus Persica_).--In the last chapter I gave two cases of\r\n    a peach-almond and double-flowered almond which suddenly produced fruit\r\n    closely resembling true peaches. I have also recorded many cases of\r\n    peach-trees producing buds, which, when developed into branches, have\r\n    yielded nectarines. We have seen that no less than six named and\r\n    several unnamed varieties of the peach have thus produced several\r\n    varieties of nectarine. I have shown that it is highly improbable that\r\n    all these peach-trees, some of which are old varieties, and have been\r\n    propagated by the million, are hybrids from the peach and nectarine,\r\n    and that it is opposed to all analogy to attribute the occasional\r\n    production of nectarines on peach-trees to the direct action of pollen\r\n    from some neighbouring nectarine-tree. Several of the cases are highly\r\n    remarkable, because, firstly, the fruit thus produced has sometimes\r\n    been in part a nectarine and in part a peach; secondly, because\r\n    nectarines thus suddenly produced have reproduced themselves by seed;\r\n    and thirdly, because nectarines are produced from peach-trees from seed\r\n    as well as from buds. The seed of the nectarine, on the other hand,\r\n    occasionally produces peaches; and we have seen in one instance that a\r\n    nectarine-tree yielded peaches by bud-variation. As the peach is\r\n    certainly the oldest or primary variety, the {375} production of\r\n    peaches from nectarines, either by seeds or buds, may perhaps be\r\n    considered as a case of reversion. Certain trees have also been\r\n    described as indifferently bearing peaches or nectarines, and this may\r\n    be considered as bud-variation carried to an extreme degree.\r\n\r\n    The _grosse mignonne_ peach at Montreuil produced \"from a sporting\r\n    branch\" the _grosse mignonne tardive_, \"a most excellent variety,\"\r\n    which ripens its fruit a fortnight later than the parent tree, and is\r\n    equally good.[813] This same peach has likewise produced by\r\n    bud-variation the _early grosse mignonne_. Hunt's large tawny nectarine\r\n    \"originated from Hunt's small tawny nectarine, but not through seminal\r\n    reproduction.\"[814]\r\n\r\n    _Plums._--Mr. Knight states that a tree of the yellow magnum bonum\r\n    plum, forty years old, which had always borne ordinary fruit, produced\r\n    a branch which yielded red magnum bonums.[815] Mr. Rivers, of\r\n    Sawbridgeworth, informs me (Jan. 1863) that a single tree out of 400 or\r\n    500 trees of the Early Prolific plum, which is a purple kind, descended\r\n    from an old French variety bearing purple fruit, produced when about\r\n    ten years old bright yellow plums; these differed in no respect except\r\n    colour from those on the other trees, but were unlike any other known\r\n    kind of yellow plum.[816]\r\n\r\n    _Cherry_ (_Prunus cerasus_).--Mr. Knight has recorded (_idem_) the case\r\n    of a branch of a May-Duke cherry, which, though certainly never\r\n    grafted, always produced fruit, ripening later, and more oblong, than\r\n    the fruit on the other branches. Another account has been given of two\r\n    May-Duke cherry-trees in Scotland, with branches bearing oblong, and\r\n    very fine fruit, which invariably ripened, as in Knight's case, a\r\n    fortnight later than the other cherries.[817]\r\n\r\n    _Grapes_ (_Vitis vinifera_).--The black or purple Frontignan in one\r\n    case produced during two successive years (and no doubt permanently)\r\n    spurs which bore white Frontignan grapes. In another case, on the same\r\n    footstalk, the lower berries \"were well-coloured black Frontignans;\r\n    those next the stalk were white, with the exception of one black and\r\n    one streaked berry;\" and altogether there were fifteen black and twelve\r\n    white berries on the same stalk. In another kind of grape black and\r\n    amber-coloured berries were produced in the same cluster.[818] Count\r\n    Odart describes a variety which often bears on the same stalk small\r\n    round and large oblong berries; though the shape of the berry is\r\n    generally a fixed character.[819] Here is another striking case given\r\n    on the excellent authority of M. Carrière:[820] \"a black Hamburgh grape\r\n    (Frankenthal) was cut down, and produced three suckers; one of these\r\n    was layered, and after a time produced much smaller berries, which\r\n    always ripened at least a fortnight {376} earlier than the others. Of\r\n    the remaining two suckers, one produced every year fine grapes, whilst\r\n    the other, although it set an abundance of fruit, matured only a few,\r\n    and these of inferior quality.\r\n\r\n    _Gooseberry_ (_Ribes grossularia_).--A remarkable case has been\r\n    described by Dr. Lindley[821] of a bush which bore at the same time no\r\n    less than four kinds of berries, namely, hairy and red,--smooth, small\r\n    and red,--green,--and yellow tinged with buff; the two latter kinds had\r\n    a different flavour from the red berries, and their seeds were coloured\r\n    red. Three twigs on this bush grew close together; the first bore three\r\n    yellow berries and one red; the second twig bore four yellow and one\r\n    red; and the third four red and one yellow. Mr. Laxton also informs me\r\n    that he has seen a Red Warrington gooseberry bearing both red and\r\n    yellow fruit on the same branch.\r\n\r\n    _Currant_ (_Ribes rubrum_).--A bush purchased as the Champagne, which\r\n    is a variety that bears blush-coloured fruit intermediate between red\r\n    and white, produced during fourteen years, on separate branches and\r\n    mingled on the same branch, berries of the red, white, and champagne\r\n    kinds.[822] The suspicion naturally arises that this variety may have\r\n    originated from a cross between a red and white variety, and that the\r\n    above transformation may be accounted for by reversion to both\r\n    parent-forms; but from the foregoing complex case of the gooseberry\r\n    this view is doubtful. In France, a branch of a red-currant bush, about\r\n    ten years old, produced near the summit five white berries, and lower\r\n    down, amongst the red berries, one berry half red and half white.[823]\r\n    Alexander Braun[824] also has often seen branches bearing red berries\r\n    on white currants.\r\n\r\n    _Pear_ (_Pyrus communis_).--Dureau de la Malle states that the flowers\r\n    on some trees of an ancient variety, the _doyenné galeux_, were\r\n    destroyed by frost: other flowers appeared in July, which produced six\r\n    pears; these exactly resembled in their skin and taste the fruit of a\r\n    distinct variety, the _gros doyenné blanc_, but in shape were like the\r\n    _bon-chrétien_: it was not ascertained whether this new variety could\r\n    be propagated by budding or grafting. The same author grafted a\r\n    _bon-chrétien_ on a quince, and it produced, besides its proper fruit,\r\n    an apparently new variety, of a peculiar form, with thick and rough\r\n    skin.[825]\r\n\r\n    _Apple_ (_Pyrus malus_).--In Canada, a tree of the variety called Pound\r\n    Sweet, produced,[826] between two of its proper fruit, an apple which\r\n    was well russetted, small in size, different in shape, and with a short\r\n    peduncle. As no russet apple grew anywhere near, this case apparently\r\n    cannot be accounted for by the direct action of foreign pollen. I shall\r\n    hereafter give {377} cases of apple-trees which regularly produce fruit\r\n    of two kinds, or half-and-half fruit; these trees are generally\r\n    supposed, and probably with truth, to be of crossed parentage, and that\r\n    the fruit reverts to both parent-forms.\r\n\r\n    _Banana_ (_Musa sapientium_).--Sir R. Schomburgk states that he saw in\r\n    St. Domingo a raceme on the Fig Banana which bore towards the base 125\r\n    fruits of the proper kind; and these were succeeded, as is usual,\r\n    higher up the raceme, by barren flowers, and these by 420 fruits,\r\n    having a widely different appearance, and ripening earlier than the\r\n    proper fruit. The abnormal fruit closely resembled, except in being\r\n    smaller, that of the _Musa Chinensis_ or _Cavendishii_, which has\r\n    generally been ranked as a distinct species.[827]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    FLOWERS.--Many cases have been recorded of a whole plant, or single\r\n    branch, or bud, suddenly producing flowers different from the proper\r\n    type in colour, form, size, doubleness, or other character. Half the\r\n    flower, or a smaller segment, sometimes changes colour.\r\n\r\n    _Camellia._--The myrtle-leaved species (_C. myrtifolia_), and two or\r\n    three varieties of the common species, have been known to produce\r\n    hexagonal and imperfectly quadrangular flowers; and the branches\r\n    producing such flowers have been propagated by grafting.[828] The\r\n    Pompone variety often bears \"four distinguishable kinds of\r\n    flowers,--the pure white and the red-eyed, which appear promiscuously;\r\n    the brindled pink and the rose-coloured, which may be kept separate\r\n    with tolerable certainty by grafting from the branches that bear them.\"\r\n    A branch, also, on an old tree of the rose-coloured variety has been\r\n    seen to \"revert to the pure white colour, an occurrence less common\r\n    than the departure from it.\"[829]\r\n\r\n    _Cratægus oxycantha._--A dark pink hawthorn has been known to throw out\r\n    a single tuft of pure white blossoms;[830] and Mr. A. Clapham,\r\n    nurseryman, of Bradford, informs me that his father had a deep crimson\r\n    thorn grafted on a white thorn, which, during several years, always\r\n    bore, high above the graft, bunches of white, pink, and deep crimson\r\n    flowers.\r\n\r\n    _Azalea Indica_ is well known often to produce by buds new varieties. I\r\n    have myself seen several cases. A plant of _Azalea Indica variegata_\r\n    has been exhibited bearing a truss of flowers of _A. Ind. Gledstanesii_\r\n    \"as true as could possibly be produced, thus evidencing the origin of\r\n    that fine variety.\" On another plant of _A. Ind. variegata_ a perfect\r\n    flower of _A. Ind. lateritia_ was produced; so that both _Gledstanesii_\r\n    and _lateritia_ no doubt originally appeared as sporting branches of\r\n    _A. Ind. variegata_.[831]\r\n\r\n    _Cistus tricuspis._--A seedling of this plant, when some years old,\r\n    produced, at Saharunpore,[832] some branches \"which bore leaves and\r\n    flowers widely different from the normal form.\" \"The abnormal leaf is\r\n    much less {378} divided, and not acuminated. The petals are\r\n    considerably larger, and quite entire. There is also in the fresh state\r\n    a conspicuous, large, oblong gland, full of a viscid secretion, on the\r\n    back of each of the calycine segments.\"\r\n\r\n    _Althæa rosea._--A double yellow Hollyock suddenly turned one year into\r\n    a pure white single kind; subsequently a branch bearing the original\r\n    double yellow flowers reappeared in the midst of the branches of the\r\n    single white kind.[833]\r\n\r\n    _Pelargonium._--These highly cultivated plants seem eminently liable to\r\n    bud-variation. I will give only a few well-marked cases. Gärtner has\r\n    seen[834] a plant of _P. zonale_ with a branch having white-edged\r\n    leaves, which remained constant for years, and bore flowers of a deeper\r\n    red than usual. Generally speaking, such branches present little or no\r\n    difference in their flowers: thus a writer[835] pinched off the leading\r\n    shoot of a seedling _P. zonale_, and it threw out three branches, which\r\n    differed in the size and colour of their leaves and stems; but on all\r\n    three branches \"the flowers were identical,\" except in being largest in\r\n    the green-stemmed variety, and smallest in that with variegated\r\n    foliage: these three varieties were subsequently propagated and\r\n    distributed. Many branches, and some whole plants, of a variety called\r\n    _compactum_, which bears orange-scarlet flowers, have been seen to\r\n    produce pink flowers.[836] Hill's Hector, which is a pale red variety,\r\n    produced a branch with lilac flowers, and some trusses with both red\r\n    and lilac flowers. This apparently is a case of reversion, for Hill's\r\n    Hector was a seedling from a lilac variety.[837] Of all Pelargoniums,\r\n    Rollisson's Unique seems to be the most sportive; its origin is not\r\n    positively known, but is believed to be from a cross. Mr. Salter, of\r\n    Hammersmith, states[838] that he has himself known this purple variety\r\n    to produce the lilac, the rose-crimson or _conspicuum_, and the red or\r\n    _coccineum_ varieties; the latter has also produced the _rose d'amour_;\r\n    so that altogether four varieties have originated by bud variation from\r\n    Rollisson's Unique. Mr. Salter remarks that these four varieties \"may\r\n    now be considered as fixed, although they occasionally produce flowers\r\n    of the original colour. This year _coccineum_ has pushed flowers of\r\n    three different colours, red, rose, and lilac, upon the same truss, and\r\n    upon other trusses are flowers half red and half lilac.\" Besides these\r\n    four varieties, two other scarlet Uniques are known to exist, both of\r\n    which occasionally produce lilac flowers identical with Rollisson's\r\n    Unique;[839] but one at least of these did not arise through\r\n    bud-variation, but is believed to be a seedling from Rollisson's\r\n    Unique.[840] There are, also, in the trade[841] two other slightly\r\n    different varieties, of unknown origin, of Rollisson's Unique: so that\r\n    altogether we have a curiously complex case {379} of variation both by\r\n    buds and seeds.[842] An English wild plant, the _Geranium pratense_,\r\n    when cultivated in a garden, has been seen to produce on the same plant\r\n    both blue and white, and striped blue and white flowers.[843]\r\n\r\n    _Chrysanthemum._--This plant frequently sports, both by its lateral\r\n    branches and occasionally by suckers. A seedling raised by Mr. Salter\r\n    has produced by bud-variation six distinct sorts, five different in\r\n    colour and one in foliage, all of which are now fixed.[844] The\r\n    varieties which were first introduced from China were so excessively\r\n    variable, \"that it was extremely difficult to tell which was the\r\n    original colour of the variety, and which was the sport.\" The same\r\n    plant would produce one year only buff-coloured, and next year only\r\n    rose-coloured flowers; and then would change again, or produce at the\r\n    same time flowers of both colours. These fluctuating varieties are now\r\n    all lost, and, when a branch sports into a new variety, it can\r\n    generally be propagated and kept true; but, as Mr. Salter remarks,\r\n    \"every sport should be thoroughly tested in different soils before it\r\n    can be really considered as fixed, as many have been known to run back\r\n    when planted in rich compost; but when sufficient care and time are\r\n    expended in proving, there will exist little danger of subsequent\r\n    disappointment.\" Mr. Salter informs me that with all the varieties the\r\n    commonest kind of bud-variation is the production of yellow flowers,\r\n    and, as this is the primordial colour, these cases may be attributed to\r\n    reversion. Mr. Salter has given me a list of seven differently coloured\r\n    chrysanthemums, which have all produced branches with yellow flowers;\r\n    but three of them have also sported into other colours. With any change\r\n    of colour in the flower, the foliage generally changes in a\r\n    corresponding manner in lightness or darkness.\r\n\r\n    Another Compositous plant, namely, _Centauria cyanus_, when cultivated\r\n    in a garden, not unfrequently produces on the same root flowers of four\r\n    different colours, viz., blue, white, dark-purple, and\r\n    particoloured.[845] The flowers of Anthemis also vary on the same\r\n    plant.[846]\r\n\r\n    _Roses._--Many varieties of the rose are known or are believed to have\r\n    originated by bud-variation.[847] The common double moss-rose was\r\n    imported into England from Italy about the year 1735.[848] Its origin\r\n    is unknown, but from analogy it probably arose from the Provence rose\r\n    (_R. centifolia_) by bud-variation; for branches of the common\r\n    moss-rose have several times been known to produce Provence roses,\r\n    wholly or partially destitute of moss: I have seen one such instance,\r\n    and several others have been recorded.[849] {380} Mr. Rivers also\r\n    informs me that he raised two or three roses of the Provence class from\r\n    seed of the old single moss-rose;[850] and this latter kind was\r\n    produced in 1807 by bud-variation from the common moss-rose. The white\r\n    moss-rose was also produced in 1788 by an offset from the common red\r\n    moss-rose: it was at first pale blush-coloured, but became white by\r\n    continued budding. On cutting down the shoots which had produced this\r\n    white moss-rose, two weak shoots were thrown up, and buds from these\r\n    yielded the beautiful striped moss-rose. The common moss-rose has\r\n    yielded by bud-variation, besides the old single red moss-rose, the old\r\n    scarlet semi-double moss-rose, and the sage-leaf moss-rose, which \"has\r\n    a delicate shell-like form, and is of a beautiful blush colour; it is\r\n    now (1852) nearly extinct.\"[851] A white moss-rose has been seen to\r\n    bear a flower half white and half pink.[852] Although several\r\n    moss-roses have thus certainly arisen by bud-variation, the greater\r\n    number probably owe their origin to seed of moss-roses. For Mr. Rivers\r\n    informs me that his seedlings from the old single moss-rose almost\r\n    always produced moss-roses; and the old single moss-rose was, as we\r\n    have seen, the product by bud-variation of the double moss-rose\r\n    originally imported from Italy. That the original moss-rose was the\r\n    product of bud-variation is probable, from the facts above given and\r\n    from the moss-rose de Meaux (also a var. of _R. centifolia_)[853]\r\n    having appeared as a sporting branch on the common rose de Meaux.\r\n\r\n    Prof. Caspary has carefully described[854] the case of a six-year-old\r\n    white moss-rose, which sent up several suckers, one of which was\r\n    thorny, and produced red flowers, destitute of moss, exactly like those\r\n    of the Provence rose (_R. centifolia_): another shoot bore both kinds\r\n    of flowers and in addition longitudinally striped flowers. As this\r\n    white moss-rose had been grafted on the Provence rose, Prof. Caspary\r\n    attributes the above changes to the influence of the stock; but from\r\n    the facts already given, and from others to be given, bud-variation,\r\n    with reversion, is probably a sufficient explanation.\r\n\r\n    Many other instances could be added of roses varying by buds. The white\r\n    Provence rose apparently thus originated.[855] The double and\r\n    highly-coloured Belladonna rose has been known[856] to produce by\r\n    suckers both semi-double and almost single white roses; whilst suckers\r\n    from one of these semi-double white roses reverted to perfectly\r\n    characterised Belladonnas. Varieties of the China rose propagated by\r\n    cuttings in St. Domingo often revert after a year or two into the old\r\n    China rose.[857] Many cases {381} have been recorded of roses suddenly\r\n    becoming striped or changing their character by segments: some plants\r\n    of the Comtesse de Chabrillant, which is properly rose-coloured, were\r\n    exhibited in 1862,[858] with crimson flakes on a rose ground. I have\r\n    seen the Beauty of Billiard with a quarter and with half the flower\r\n    almost white. The Austrian bramble (_R. lutea_) not rarely[859]\r\n    produces branches with pure yellow flowers; and Prof. Henslow has seen\r\n    exactly half the flower of a pure yellow, and I have seen narrow yellow\r\n    streaks on a single petal, of which the rest was of the usual copper\r\n    colour.\r\n\r\n    The following cases are highly remarkable. Mr. Rivers, as I am informed\r\n    by him, possessed a new French rose with delicate smooth shoots, pale\r\n    glaucous-green leaves, and semi-double pale flesh-coloured flowers\r\n    striped with dark red; and on branches thus characterised there\r\n    suddenly appeared, in more than one instance, the famous old rose\r\n    called the Baronne Prevost, with its stout thorny shoots, and immense,\r\n    uniformly and richly coloured, double flowers; so that in this case the\r\n    shoots, leaves, and flowers, all at once changed their character by\r\n    bud-variation. According to M. Verlot[860] a variety called _Rosa\r\n    cannabifolia_, which has peculiarly shaped leaflets, and differs from\r\n    every member of the family in the leaves being opposite instead of\r\n    alternate, suddenly appeared on a plant of _R. alba_ in the gardens of\r\n    the Luxembourg. Lastly, \"a running shoot\" was observed by Mr. H.\r\n    Curtis[861] on the old Aimée Vibert Noisette, and he budded it on\r\n    Celine; thus a climbing Aimée Vibert was first produced and afterwards\r\n    propagated.\r\n\r\n    _Dianthus._--It is quite common with the Sweet William (_D. barbatus_)\r\n    to see differently coloured flowers on the same root; and I have\r\n    observed on the same truss four differently coloured and shaded\r\n    flowers. Carnations and pinks (_D. caryophyllus_, &c.) occasionally\r\n    vary by layers; and some kinds are so little certain in character that\r\n    they are called by floriculturists \"catch-flowers.\"[862] Mr. Dickson\r\n    has ably discussed the \"running\" of particoloured or striped\r\n    carnations, and says it cannot be accounted for by the compost in which\r\n    they are grown: \"layers from the same clean flower would come part of\r\n    them clean and part foul, even when subjected to precisely the same\r\n    treatment; and frequently one flower alone appears influenced by the\r\n    taint, the remainder coming perfectly clean.\"[863] This running of the\r\n    parti-coloured flowers apparently is a case of reversion by buds to the\r\n    original uniform tint of the species.\r\n\r\n    I will briefly mention some other cases of bud-variation to show how\r\n    many plants belonging to many orders have varied in their flowers;\r\n    numerous cases might be added. I have seen on a snap-dragon\r\n    (_Antirrhinum majus_) white, pink, and striped flowers on the same\r\n    plant, and branches with striped flowers on a red-coloured variety. On\r\n    a double stock (_Matthiola incana_) I have seen a branch bearing single\r\n    flowers; and {382} on a dingy-purple, double variety of the wall-flower\r\n    (_Cheiranthus cheiri_) a branch which had reverted to the ordinary\r\n    copper colour. On other branches of the same plant, some flowers were\r\n    exactly divided across the middle, one half being purple and the other\r\n    coppery; but some of the smaller petals towards the centre of these\r\n    same flowers were purple longitudinally streaked with coppery colour,\r\n    or coppery streaked with purple. A Cyclamen[864] has been observed to\r\n    bear white and pink flowers of two forms, the one resembling the\r\n    Persicum strain, and the other the Coum strain. _Oenothera biennis_ has\r\n    been seen[865] bearing flowers of three different colours. The hybrid\r\n    _Gladiolus colvillii_ occasionally bears uniformly coloured flowers,\r\n    and one case is recorded[866] of all the flowers on a plant thus\r\n    changing colour. A Fuchsia has been seen[867] bearing two kinds of\r\n    flowers. _Mirabilis jalapa_ is eminently sportive, sometimes bearing on\r\n    the same root pure red, yellow, and white flowers, and others striped\r\n    with various combinations of these three colours.[868] The plants of\r\n    the Mirabilis which bear such extraordinarily variable flowers, in\r\n    most, probably in all cases, owe their origin, as shown by Prof. Lecoq,\r\n    to crosses between differently-coloured varieties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Leaves and Shoots._--Changes, through bud-variation, in fruits and\r\n    flowers have hitherto been treated of, but incidentally some remarkable\r\n    modifications in the leaves and shoots of the rose and Cistus, and in a\r\n    lesser degree in the foliage of the Pelargonium and Chrysanthemum, have\r\n    been noticed. I will now add a few more cases of variation in\r\n    leaf-buds. Verlot[869] states that on _Aralia trifoliata_, which\r\n    properly has leaves with three leaflets, branches bearing simple leaves\r\n    of various forms frequently appear; these can be propagated by buds or\r\n    grafting, and have given rise, as he states, to several nominal\r\n    species.\r\n\r\n    With respect to trees, the history of but few of the many varieties\r\n    with curious or ornamental foliage is known; but several probably have\r\n    originated by bud-variation. Here is one case:--An old ash-tree\r\n    (_Fraxinus excelsior_) in the grounds of Necton, as Mr. Mason states,\r\n    \"for many years has had one bough of a totally different character to\r\n    the rest of the tree, or of any other ash-tree which I have seen; being\r\n    short-jointed and densely covered with foliage.\" It was ascertained\r\n    that this variety could be propagated by grafts.[870] The varieties of\r\n    some trees with cut leaves, as the oak-leaved laburnum, the\r\n    parsley-leaved vine, and especially the fern-leaved beech, are apt to\r\n    revert by buds to the common form.[871] The fern-like leaves of the\r\n    beech sometimes revert only partially, and the branches display here\r\n    and there sprouts bearing common leaves, fern-like, and variously\r\n    shaped leaves. Such cases differ but little from the so-called {383}\r\n    heterophyllous varieties, in which the tree habitually bears leaves of\r\n    various forms; but it is probable that most heterophyllous trees have\r\n    originated as seedlings. There is a sub-variety of the weeping willow\r\n    with leaves rolled up into a spiral coil; and Mr. Masters states that a\r\n    tree of this kind kept true in his garden for twenty-five years, and\r\n    then threw out a single upright shoot bearing flat leaves.[872]\r\n\r\n    I have often noticed single twigs and branches on beech and other trees\r\n    with their leaves fully expanded before those on the other branches had\r\n    opened; and as there was nothing in their exposure or character to\r\n    account for this difference, I presume that they had appeared as\r\n    bud-variations, like the early and late fruit-maturing varieties of the\r\n    peach and nectarine.\r\n\r\n    Cryptogamic plants are liable to bud-variation, for fronds on the same\r\n    fern are often seen to display remarkable deviations of structure.\r\n    Spores, which are of the nature of buds, taken from such abnormal\r\n    fronds, reproduce, with remarkable fidelity, the same variety, after\r\n    passing through the sexual stage.[873]\r\n\r\n    With respect to colour, leaves often become by bud-variation zoned,\r\n    blotched, or spotted with white, yellow, and red; and this occasionally\r\n    occurs even with plants in a state of nature. Variegation, however,\r\n    appears still more frequently in plants produced from seed; even the\r\n    cotyledons or seed-leaves being thus affected.[874] There have been\r\n    endless disputes whether variegation should be considered as a disease.\r\n    In a future chapter we shall see that it is much influenced, both in\r\n    the case of seedlings and of mature plants, by the nature of the soil.\r\n    Plants which have become variegated as seedlings, generally transmit\r\n    their character by seed to a large proportion of their progeny; and Mr.\r\n    Salter has given me a list of eight genera in which this occurred.[875]\r\n    Sir F. Pollock has given me more precise information: he sowed seed\r\n    from a variegated plant of _Ballota nigra_ which was found growing\r\n    wild, and thirty per cent. of the seedlings were variegated; seed from\r\n    these latter being sown, sixty per cent. came up variegated. When\r\n    branches become variegated by bud-variation, and the variety is\r\n    attempted to be propagated by seed, the seedlings are rarely\r\n    variegated; Mr. Salter found this to be the case with plants belonging\r\n    to eleven genera, in which the greater number of the seedlings proved\r\n    to be green-leaved; yet a few were slightly variegated, or were quite\r\n    white, but none were worth keeping. Variegated plants, whether\r\n    originally produced from seeds or buds, can generally be propagated by\r\n    budding, grafting, &c.; but all are apt to revert by bud-variation to\r\n    their ordinary foliage. This tendency, however, differs much in the\r\n    varieties of even the same species; for instance, the golden-striped\r\n    variety of _Euonymus Japonicus_ \"is very liable to run back to the\r\n    green-leaved, while the silver-striped {384} variety hardly ever\r\n    changes.\"[876] I have seen a variety of the holly, with its leaves\r\n    having a central yellow patch, which had everywhere partially reverted\r\n    to the ordinary foliage, so that on the same small branch there were\r\n    many twigs of both kinds. In the pelargonium, and in some other plants,\r\n    variegation is generally accompanied by some degree of dwarfing, as is\r\n    well exemplified in the \"Dandy\" pelargonium. When such dwarf varieties\r\n    sport back by buds or suckers to the ordinary foliage, the dwarfed\r\n    stature sometimes still remains.[877] It is remarkable that plants\r\n    propagated from branches which have reverted from variegated to plain\r\n    leaves[878] do not always (or never, as one observer asserts) perfectly\r\n    resemble the original plain-leaved plant from which the variegated\r\n    branch arose: it seems that a plant, in passing by bud-variation from\r\n    plain leaves to variegated, and back again from variegated to plain, is\r\n    generally in some degree affected so as to assume a slightly different\r\n    aspect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Bud-variation by Suckers, Tubers, and Bulbs._--All the cases hitherto\r\n    given of bud-variation in fruits, flowers, leaves, and shoots, have\r\n    been confined to buds on the stems or branches, with the exception of a\r\n    few cases incidentally noticed of varying suckers in the rose,\r\n    pelargonium, and chrysanthemum. I will now give a few instances of\r\n    variation in subterranean buds, that is, by suckers, tubers, and bulbs;\r\n    not that there is any essential difference between buds above and\r\n    beneath the ground. Mr. Salter informs me that two variegated varieties\r\n    of Phlox originated as suckers; but I should not have thought these\r\n    worth mentioning, had not Mr. Salter found, after repeated trials, that\r\n    he could not propagate them by \"root-joints,\" whereas, the variegated\r\n    _Tussilago farfara_ can thus be safely propagated;[879] but this latter\r\n    plant may have originated as a variegated seedling, which would account\r\n    for its greater fixedness of character. The Barberry (_Berberis\r\n    vulgaris_) offers an analogous case; there is a well-known variety with\r\n    seedless fruit, which can be propagated by cuttings or layers; but\r\n    suckers always revert to the common form, which produces fruit\r\n    containing seeds.[880] My father repeatedly tried this experiment, and\r\n    always with the same result.\r\n\r\n    Turning now to tubers: in the common Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) a\r\n    single bud or eye sometimes varies and produces a new variety; or,\r\n    occasionally, and this is a much more remarkable circumstance, all the\r\n    eyes in a tuber vary in the same manner and at the same time, so that\r\n    the whole tuber assumes a new character. For instance, a single eye in\r\n    a tuber of the {385} old _Forty-fold potato_, which is a purple\r\n    variety, was observed[881] to become white; this eye was cut out and\r\n    planted separately, and the kind has since been largely propagated.\r\n    _Kemp's Potato_ is properly white, but a plant in Lancashire produced\r\n    two tubers which were red, and two which were white; the red kind was\r\n    propagated in the usual manner by eyes, and kept true to its new\r\n    colour, and, being found a more productive variety, soon became widely\r\n    known under the name of _Taylor's Forty-fold_.[882] The _Old\r\n    Forty-fold_ potato, as already stated, is a purple variety; but a plant\r\n    long cultivated on the same ground produced, not as in the case above\r\n    given a single white eye, but a whole white tuber, which has since been\r\n    propagated and keeps true.[883] Several cases have been recorded of\r\n    large portions of whole rows of potatoes slightly changing their\r\n    character.[884]\r\n\r\n    Dahlias propagated by tubers under the hot climate of St. Domingo vary\r\n    much; Sir R. Schomburgk gives the case of the \"Butterfly variety,\"\r\n    which the second year produced on the same plant \"double and single\r\n    flowers; here white petals edged with maroon; there of a uniform deep\r\n    maroon.\"[885] Mr. Bree also mentions a plant \"which bore two different\r\n    kinds of self-coloured flowers, as well as a third kind which partook\r\n    of both colours beautifully intermixed.\"[886] Another case is described\r\n    of a dahlia with purple flowers which bore a white flower streaked with\r\n    purple.[887]\r\n\r\n    Considering how long and extensively many Bulbous plants have been\r\n    cultivated, and how numerous are the varieties produced from seed,\r\n    these plants have not varied so much by offsets,--that is, by the\r\n    production of new bulbs,--as might have been expected. With the\r\n    Hyacinth a case has been recorded of a blue variety which for three\r\n    successive years gave offsets which produced white flowers with a red\r\n    centre.[888] Another hyacinth has been described[889] as bearing on the\r\n    same truss a perfectly pink and a perfectly blue flower.\r\n\r\n    Mr. John Scott informs me that in 1862 _Imatophyllum miniatum_, in the\r\n    Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh, threw up a sucker which differed from the\r\n    normal form, in the leaves being two-ranked instead of four-ranked. The\r\n    leaves were also smaller, with the upper surface raised instead of\r\n    being channelled.\r\n\r\n    In the propagation of _Tulips_, seedlings are raised, called _selfs_ or\r\n    _breeders_, which \"consist of one plain colour on a white or yellow\r\n    bottom. These, being cultivated on a dry and rather poor soil, become\r\n    broken or variegated and produce new varieties. The time that elapses\r\n    before they break varies from one to twenty years or more, and\r\n    sometimes this change never takes place.\"[890] The various broken or\r\n    variegated colours which give value to all tulips are due to\r\n    bud-variation; for although the {386} Bybloemens and some other kinds\r\n    have been raised from several distinct breeders, yet all the Baguets\r\n    are said to have come from a single breeder or seedling. This\r\n    bud-variation, in accordance with the views of MM. Vilmorin and\r\n    Verlot,[891] is probably an attempt to revert to that uniform colour\r\n    which is natural to the species. A tulip, however, which has already\r\n    become broken, when treated with too strong manure, is liable to flush\r\n    or lose by a second act of reversion its variegated colours. Some\r\n    kinds, as Imperatrix Florum, are much more liable than others to\r\n    flushing; and Mr. Dickson maintains[892] that this can no more be\r\n    accounted for than the variation of any other plant. He believes that\r\n    English growers, from care in choosing seed from broken flowers instead\r\n    of from plain flowers, have to a certain extent diminished the tendency\r\n    in flowers already broken to flushing or secondary reversion.\r\n\r\n    During two consecutive years all the early flowers in a bed of\r\n    _Tigridia conchiflora_[893] resembled those of the old _T. pavonia_;\r\n    but the later flowers assumed their proper colour of fine yellow\r\n    spotted with crimson. An apparently authentic account has been\r\n    published[894] of two forms of Hemerocallis, which have been\r\n    universally considered as distinct species, changing into each other;\r\n    for the roots of the large-flowered tawny _H. fulva_, being divided and\r\n    planted in a different soil and place, produced the small-flowered\r\n    yellow _H. flava_, as well as some intermediate forms. It is doubtful\r\n    whether such cases as these latter, as well as the \"flushing\" of broken\r\n    tulips and the \"running\" of particoloured carnations,--that is, their\r\n    more or less complete return to a uniform tint,--ought to be classed\r\n    under bud-variation, or ought to be retained for the chapter in which I\r\n    treat of the direct action of the conditions of life on organic beings.\r\n    These cases, however, have this much in common with bud-variation, that\r\n    the change is effected through buds and not through seminal\r\n    reproduction. But, on the other hand, there is this difference--that in\r\n    ordinary cases of bud-variation, one bud alone changes, whilst in the\r\n    foregoing cases all the buds on the same plant were modified together;\r\n    yet we have an intermediate case, for with the potato all the eyes in\r\n    one tuber alone simultaneously changed their character.\r\n\r\n    I will conclude with a few allied cases, which may be ranked either\r\n    under bud-variation, or under the direct action of the conditions of\r\n    life. When the common Hepatica is transplanted from its native woods,\r\n    the flowers change colour, even during the first year.[895] It is\r\n    notorious that the improved varieties of the Heartsease (_Viola\r\n    tricolor_) when transplanted often produce flowers widely different in\r\n    size, form, and colour: for instance, I transplanted a large\r\n    uniformly-coloured dark purple variety, whilst in full flower, and it\r\n    then produced much smaller, more elongated flowers, with the lower\r\n    petals yellow; these were succeeded by flowers marked with large purple\r\n    spots, and ultimately, towards the end of the same summer, by the\r\n    original large dark purple flowers. The slight changes which some {387}\r\n    fruit-trees undergo from being grafted and regrafted on various\r\n    stocks,[896] were considered by Andrew Knight[897] as closely allied to\r\n    \"sporting branches,\" or bud-variations. Again, we have the case of\r\n    young fruit-trees changing their character as they grow old; seedling\r\n    pears, for instance, lose with age their spines and improve in the\r\n    flavour of their fruit. Weeping birch-trees, when grafted on the common\r\n    variety, do not acquire a perfect pendulous habit until they grow old:\r\n    on the other hand, I shall hereafter give the case of some weeping\r\n    ashes which slowly and gradually assumed an upright habit of growth.\r\n    All such changes, dependent on age, may be compared with the changes,\r\n    alluded to in the last chapter, which many trees naturally undergo; as\r\n    in the case of the Deodar and Cedar of Lebanon, which are unlike in\r\n    youth and closely resemble each other in old age; and as with certain\r\n    oaks, and with some varieties of the lime and hawthorn.[898]\r\n\r\nBefore giving a summary on Bud-variation I will discuss some singular and\r\nanomalous cases, which are more or less closely related to this same\r\nsubject. I will begin with the famous case of Adam's laburnum or _Cytisus\r\nAdami_, a form or hybrid intermediate between two very distinct species,\r\nnamely, _C. laburnum_ and _purpureus_, the common and purple laburnum; but\r\nas this tree has often been described, I will be as brief as I can.\r\n\r\n    Throughout Europe, in different soils and under different climates,\r\n    branches on this tree have repeatedly and suddenly reverted to both\r\n    parent-species in their flowers and leaves. To behold mingled on the\r\n    same tree tufts of dingy-red, bright yellow, and purple flowers, borne\r\n    on branches having widely different leaves and manner of growth, is a\r\n    surprising sight. The same raceme sometimes bears two kinds of flowers;\r\n    and I have seen a single flower exactly divided into halves, one side\r\n    being bright yellow and the other purple; so that one half of the\r\n    standard-petal was yellow and of larger size, and the other half purple\r\n    and smaller. In another flower the whole corolla was bright yellow, but\r\n    exactly half the calyx was purple. In another, one of the dingy-red\r\n    wing-petals had a bright yellow narrow stripe on it; and lastly, in\r\n    another flower, one of the stamens, which had become slightly\r\n    foliaceous, was half yellow and half purple; so that the tendency to\r\n    segregation of character or reversion affects even single parts {388}\r\n    and organs.[899] The most remarkable fact about this tree is that in\r\n    its intermediate state, even when growing near both parent-species, it\r\n    is quite sterile; but when the flowers become pure yellow or pure\r\n    purple they yield seed. I believe that the pods from the yellow flowers\r\n    yield a full complement of seed; they certainly yield a large number.\r\n    Two seedlings raised by Mr. Herbert from such seed[900] exhibited a\r\n    purple tinge on the stalks of their flowers; but several seedlings\r\n    raised by myself resembled in every character the common laburnum, with\r\n    the exception that some of them had remarkably long racemes: these\r\n    seedlings were perfectly fertile. That such purity of character and\r\n    fertility should be suddenly reacquired from so hybridized and sterile\r\n    a form is an astonishing phenomenon. The branches with purple flowers\r\n    appear at first sight exactly to resemble those of _C. purpureus_; but\r\n    on careful comparison I found that they differed from the pure species\r\n    in the shoots being thicker, the leaves a little broader, and the\r\n    flowers slightly shorter, with the corolla and calyx less brightly\r\n    purple: the basal part of the standard-petal also plainly showed a\r\n    trace of the yellow stain. So that the flowers, at least in this\r\n    instance, had not perfectly recovered their true character; and in\r\n    accordance with this, they were not perfectly fertile, for many of the\r\n    pods contained no seed, some produced one, and very few contained as\r\n    many as two seeds; whilst numerous pods on a tree of the pure _C.\r\n    purpureus_ in my garden contained three, four, and five fine seeds. The\r\n    pollen, moreover, was very imperfect, a multitude of grains being small\r\n    and shrivelled; and this is a singular fact; for, as we shall\r\n    immediately see, the pollen-grains in the dingy-red and sterile flowers\r\n    on the parent-tree, were, in external appearance, in a much better\r\n    state, and included very few shrivelled grain. Although the pollen of\r\n    the reverted purple flowers was in so poor a condition, the ovules were\r\n    well-formed, and, when mature, germinated freely with me. Mr. Herbert\r\n    also raised plants from seeds of the reverted purple flowers, and they\r\n    differed _very little_ from the usual state of _C. purpureus_; but this\r\n    expression shows that they had not perfectly recovered their proper\r\n    character.\r\n\r\n    Prof. Caspary has examined the ovules of the dingy-red and sterile\r\n    flowers in several plants of _C. adami_ on the Continent,[901] and\r\n    finds them generally monstrous. In three plants examined by me in\r\n    England, the ovules were likewise monstrous, the nucleus varying much\r\n    in shape, and projecting irregularly beyond the proper coats. The\r\n    pollen-grains, on the other hand, judging from their external\r\n    appearance, were remarkably good, and readily protruded their tubes. By\r\n    repeatedly counting, under the microscope, the proportional number of\r\n    bad grains, Prof. Caspary ascertained that only 2.5 per cent. were bad,\r\n    which is a less proportion than in the pollen of three pure species of\r\n    Cytisus in their cultivated state, viz. _C. purpureus_, _laburnum_, and\r\n    _alpinus_. Although the pollen of _C. adami_ is thus in appearance\r\n    good, it does not follow, according {389} to M. Naudin's\r\n    observations[902] on Mirabilis, that it would be functionally\r\n    effective. The fact of the ovules of _C. adami_ being monstrous, and\r\n    the pollen apparently sound, is all the more remarkable, because it is\r\n    opposed to what usually occurs not only with most hybrids,[903] but\r\n    with two hybrids in the same genus, namely in _C. purpureo-elongatus_,\r\n    and _C. alpino-laburnum_. In both these hybrids, the ovules, as\r\n    observed by Prof. Caspary and myself, were well-formed, whilst many of\r\n    the pollen-grains were ill-formed; in the latter hybrid 20.3 per cent.,\r\n    and in the former no less than 84.8 per cent. of the grains were\r\n    ascertained by Prof. Caspary to be bad. This unusual condition of the\r\n    male and female reproductive elements in _C. adami_ has been used by\r\n    Prof. Caspary as an argument against this plant being considered as an\r\n    ordinary hybrid produced from seed; but we should remember that with\r\n    hybrids the ovules have not been examined nearly so frequently as the\r\n    pollen, and they may be much oftener imperfect than is generally\r\n    supposed. Dr. E. Bornet, of Antibes, informs me (through Mr. J.\r\n    Traherne Moggridge) that with hybrid Cisti the ovarium is frequently\r\n    deformed, the ovules being in some cases quite absent, and in other\r\n    cases incapable of fertilisation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Several theories have been propounded to account for the origin of _C.\r\n    adami_, and for the transformations which it undergoes. These\r\n    transformations have been attributed by some authors to simple\r\n    bud-variation; but considering the wide difference between _C.\r\n    laburnum_ and _purpureus_, both of which are natural species, and\r\n    considering the sterility of the intermediate form, this view may be\r\n    summarily rejected. We shall presently see that, with hybrid plants,\r\n    two different embryos may be developed within the same seed and cohere;\r\n    and it has been supposed that _C. adami_ might have thus originated. It\r\n    is known that when a plant with variegated leaves is budded on a plain\r\n    stock, the latter is sometimes affected, and it is believed by some\r\n    that the laburnum has been thus affected. Thus Mr. Purser states[904]\r\n    that a common laburnum-tree in his garden, into which three _grafts_ of\r\n    the _Cytisus purpureus_ had been inserted, gradually assumed the\r\n    character of _C. adami_; but more evidence and copious details would be\r\n    requisite to make so extraordinary a statement credible.\r\n\r\n    Many authors maintain that _C. adami_ is a hybrid produced in the\r\n    common way by seed, and that it has reverted by buds to its two\r\n    parent-forms. Negative results are of little value; but Reisseck,\r\n    Caspary, and I myself, tried in vain to cross _C. laburnum_ and\r\n    _purpureus_; when I fertilised the former with pollen of the latter, I\r\n    had the nearest approach to success, for pods were formed, but in\r\n    sixteen days after the withering of the flowers they fell off.\r\n    Nevertheless, the belief that _C. adami_ is a spontaneously produced\r\n    hybrid between these two species is strongly supported by the fact that\r\n    hybrids between these species and two others have spontaneously {390}\r\n    arisen. In a bed of seedlings from _C. elongatus_, which grew near to\r\n    _C. purpureus,_ and was probably fertilised by it, through the agency\r\n    of insects (for these, as I know by experiment, play an important part\r\n    in the fertilisation of the laburnum), the sterile hybrid _C.\r\n    purpureo-elongatus_ appeared.[905] Thus, also, Waterer's laburnum, the\r\n    _C. alpino-laburnum_,[906] spontaneously appeared, as I am informed by\r\n    Mr. Waterer, in a bed of seedlings.\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, we have a clear and distinct account given by M.\r\n    Adam, who raised the plant, to Poiteau,[907] showing that _C. adami_ is\r\n    not an ordinary hybrid. M. Adam inserted in the usual manner a shield\r\n    of the bark of _C. purpureus_ into a stock of _C. laburnum_; and the\r\n    bud lay dormant, as often happens, for a year; the shield then produced\r\n    many buds and shoots, one of which grew more upright and vigorous with\r\n    larger leaves than the shoots of _C. purpureus_, and was consequently\r\n    propagated. Now it deserves especial notice that these plants were sold\r\n    by M. Adam, as a variety of _C. purpureus_, before they had flowered;\r\n    and the account was published by Poiteau after the plants had flowered,\r\n    but before they had exhibited their remarkable tendency to revert into\r\n    the two parent-species. So that there was no conceivable motive for\r\n    falsification, and it is difficult to see how there could have been any\r\n    error. If we admit as true M. Adam's account, we must admit the\r\n    extraordinary fact that two distinct species can unite by their\r\n    cellular tissue, and subsequently produce a plant bearing leaves and\r\n    sterile flowers intermediate in character between the scion and stock,\r\n    and producing buds liable to reversion; in short, resembling in every\r\n    important respect a hybrid formed in the ordinary way by seminal\r\n    reproduction. Such plants, if really thus formed, might be called\r\n    graft-hybrids.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I will now give all the facts which I have been able to collect\r\n    illustrative of the above theories, not for the sake of merely throwing\r\n    light on the origin of _C. adami_, but to show in how many\r\n    extraordinary and complex methods one kind of plant may affect another,\r\n    generally in connection with bud-variation. The supposition that either\r\n    _C. laburnum_ or _purpureus_ produced by ordinary bud-variation the\r\n    intermediate and the other form, may, as already remarked, be\r\n    absolutely excluded, from the want of any evidence, from the great\r\n    amount of change thus implied, {391} and from the sterility of the\r\n    intermediate form. Nevertheless such cases as nectarines suddenly\r\n    appearing on peach-trees, occasionally with the fruit half-and-half in\r\n    nature,--moss-roses appearing on other roses, with the flowers divided\r\n    into halves, or striped with different colours,--and other such cases,\r\n    are closely analogous in the result produced, though not in origin,\r\n    with the case of _C. adami_.\r\n\r\n    A distinguished botanist, Mr. G. H. Thwaites,[908] has recorded a\r\n    remarkable case of a seed from _Fuchsia coccinea_ fertilised by _F.\r\n    fulgens_, which contained two embryos, and was \"a true vegetable twin.\"\r\n    The two plants produced from the two embryos were \"extremely different\r\n    in appearance and character,\" though both resembled other hybrids of\r\n    the same parentage produced at the same time. These twin plants \"were\r\n    closely coherent, below the two pairs of cotyledon-leaves, into a\r\n    single cylindrical stem, so that they had subsequently the appearance\r\n    of being branches on one trunk.\" Had the two united stems grown up to\r\n    their full height, instead of dying, a curiously mixed hybrid would\r\n    have been produced; but even if some of the buds had subsequently\r\n    reverted to both parent-forms, the case, although more complex, would\r\n    not have been strictly analogous with that of _C. adami_. On the other\r\n    hand, a mongrel melon described by Sageret[909] perhaps did thus\r\n    originate; for the two main branches, which arose from two\r\n    cotyledon-buds, produced very different fruit,--on the one branch like\r\n    that of the paternal variety, and on the other branch to a certain\r\n    extent like that of the maternal variety, the melon of China.\r\n\r\n    The famous _bizzarria Orange_ offers a strictly parallel case to that\r\n    of _Cytisus adami_. The gardener who in 1644 in Florence raised this\r\n    tree, declared that it was a seedling which had been grafted; and after\r\n    the graft had perished, the stock sprouted and produced the bizzarria.\r\n    Gallesio, who carefully examined several living specimens and compared\r\n    them with the description given by the original describer P. Nato,[910]\r\n    states that the tree produces at the same time leaves, flowers, and\r\n    fruit, identical with the bitter orange and with the citron of\r\n    Florence, and likewise compound fruit with the two kinds either blended\r\n    together, both externally and internally, or segregated in various\r\n    ways. This tree can be propagated by cuttings, and retains its\r\n    diversified character. The so-called trifacial orange of Alexandria and\r\n    Smyrna[911] resembles in its general nature the bizzarria, but differs\r\n    from it in the _sweet_ orange and citron being blended together in the\r\n    same fruit, and separately produced on the same tree: nothing is known\r\n    of its origin. In regard to the bizzarria, many authors believe that it\r\n    is a graft-hybrid; Gallesio on the other hand thinks that it is an\r\n    ordinary hybrid, with the habit of partially reverting {392} by buds to\r\n    the two parent-forms; and we have seen in the last chapter that the\r\n    species in this genus often cross spontaneously.\r\n\r\n    Here is another analogous, but doubtful case. A writer in the\r\n    'Gardener's Chronicle'[912] states that an _Æsculus rubicunda_ in his\r\n    garden yearly produced on one of its branches \"spikes of pale yellow\r\n    flowers, smaller in size and somewhat similar in colour to those of _Æ.\r\n    flava_.\" If as the editor believes _Æsculus rubicunda_ is a hybrid\r\n    descended on one side from _Æ. flava_, we have a case of partial\r\n    reversion to one of the parent-forms. If, as some botanists maintain,\r\n    _Æ. rubicunda_ is not a hybrid, but a natural species, the case is one\r\n    of simple bud-variation.\r\n\r\n    The following facts show that hybrids produced from seed in the\r\n    ordinary way, certainly sometimes revert by buds to their parent-forms.\r\n    Hybrids between _Tropæolum minus_ and _majus_[913] at first produced\r\n    flowers intermediate in size, colour, and structure between their two\r\n    parents; but later in the season some of these plants produced flowers\r\n    in all respects like those of the mother-form, mingled with flowers\r\n    still retaining the usual intermediate condition. A hybrid Cereus\r\n    between _C. speciosissimus_ and _phyllanthus_,[914] plants which are\r\n    widely different in appearance, produced for the first three years\r\n    angular, five-sided stems, and then some flat stems like those of _C.\r\n    phyllanthus_. Kölreuter also gives cases of hybrid Lobelias and\r\n    Verbascums, which at first produced flowers of one colour, and later in\r\n    the season flowers of a different colour.[915] Naudin[916] raised forty\r\n    hybrids from _Datura lævis_ fertilised by _D. stramonium_; and three of\r\n    these hybrids produced many capsules, of which a half, or quarter, or\r\n    lesser segment was smooth and of small size like the capsule of the\r\n    pure _D. lævis_, the remaining part being spinose and of larger size\r\n    like the capsule of the pure _D. stramonium_: from one of these\r\n    composite capsules, plants were raised which perfectly resembled both\r\n    parent-forms.\r\n\r\n    Turning now to varieties. A _seedling_ apple, conjectured to be of\r\n    crossed parentage, has been described in France,[917] which bears\r\n    fruit, with one half larger than the other, of a red colour, acid\r\n    taste, and peculiar odour; the other side being greenish-yellow and\r\n    very sweet: it is said scarcely ever to include perfectly developed\r\n    seed. I suppose that this is not the same tree with that which\r\n    Gaudichaud[918] exhibited before the French Institute, bearing on the\r\n    same branch two distinct kinds of apples, one a _reinette rouge_, and\r\n    the other like a _reinette canada jaunâtre_: this double-bearing\r\n    variety can be propagated by grafts, and continues to produce both\r\n    kinds; its origin is unknown. The Rev. J. D. La Touche sent me a\r\n    coloured drawing of an apple which he brought from Canada, of which\r\n    half, surrounding and including the whole of the calyx and the\r\n    insertion of the {393} footstalk, is green, the other half being brown\r\n    and of the nature of the _pomme gris_ apple, with the line of\r\n    separation between the two halves exactly defined. The tree was a\r\n    grafted one, and Mr. La Touche thinks that the branch which bore this\r\n    curious apple sprung from the point of junction of the graft and stock:\r\n    had this fact been ascertained, the case would probably have come into\r\n    the small class of graft-hybrids presently to be given. But the branch\r\n    may have sprung from the stock, which no doubt was a seedling.\r\n\r\n    Prof. H. Lecoq, who has made a great number of crosses between the\r\n    differently coloured varieties of _Mirabilis jalapa_,[919] finds that\r\n    in the seedlings the colours rarely combine, but form distinct stripes;\r\n    or half the flower is of one colour and half of a different colour.\r\n    Some varieties regularly bear flowers striped with yellow, white, and\r\n    red; but plants of such varieties occasionally produce on the same root\r\n    branches with uniformly coloured flowers of all three tints, and other\r\n    branches with half-and-half coloured flowers and others with marbled\r\n    flowers. Gallesio[920] crossed reciprocally white and red carnations,\r\n    and the seedlings were striped; but some of the striped plants also\r\n    bore entirely white and entirely red flowers. Some of these plants\r\n    produced one year red flowers alone, and in the following year striped\r\n    flowers; or conversely, some plants, after having borne for two or\r\n    three years striped flowers, would revert and bear exclusively red\r\n    flowers. It may be worth mentioning that I fertilised the _Purple\r\n    Sweet-pea_ (_Lathyrus odoratus_) with pollen from the light-coloured\r\n    _Painted Lady_: seedlings raised from one and the same pod were not\r\n    intermediate in character, but perfectly resembled both parents. Later\r\n    in the summer, the plants which had at first borne flowers identical\r\n    with those of the _Painted Lady_, produced flowers streaked and\r\n    blotched with purple; showing in these darker marks a tendency to\r\n    reversion to the mother-variety. Andrew Knight[921] fertilised two\r\n    white grapes with pollen of the Aleppo grape, which is darkly\r\n    variegated both in its leaves and fruit. The result was that the young\r\n    seedlings were not at first variegated, but all became variegated\r\n    during the succeeding summer; besides this, many produced on the same\r\n    plant bunches of grapes which were all black, or all white, or\r\n    lead-coloured striped with white, or white dotted with minute black\r\n    stripes; and grapes of all these shades could frequently be found on\r\n    the same footstalk.\r\n\r\nIn most of these cases of crossed varieties, and in some of the cases of\r\ncrossed species, the colours proper to both parents appeared in the\r\nseedlings, as soon as they first flowered, in the form of stripes or larger\r\nsegments, or as whole flowers or fruit of two kinds borne on the same\r\nplant; and in this case the appearance of the two colours cannot strictly\r\nbe said to be due to reversion, but to some incapacity of fusion, leading\r\nto their {394} segregation. When, however, the later flowers or fruit,\r\nproduced during the same season or during a succeeding year or generation,\r\nbecome striped or half-in-half, &c., the segregation of the two colours is\r\nstrictly a case of reversion by bud-variation. In a future chapter I shall\r\nshow that, with animals of crossed parentage, the same individual has been\r\nknown to change its character during growth, and to revert to one of its\r\nparents which it did not at first resemble. From the various facts now\r\ngiven there can be no doubt that the same individual plant, whether a\r\nhybrid or a mongrel, sometimes returns in its leaves, flowers, and fruit,\r\neither wholly or by segments, to both parent-forms, in the same manner as\r\nthe _Cytisus adami_, and the _Bizzarria Orange_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the few facts which have been recorded in support of\r\nthe belief that a variety when grafted or budded on another variety\r\nsometimes affects the whole stock, or at the point of junction gives rise\r\nto a bud, or graft-hybrid, which partakes of the characters of both stock\r\nand scion.\r\n\r\n    It is notorious that when the variegated Jessamine is budded on the\r\n    common kind, the stock sometimes produces buds bearing variegated\r\n    leaves: Mr. Rivers, as he informs me, has seen instances of this. The\r\n    same thing occurs with the Oleander.[922] Mr. Rivers, on the authority\r\n    of a trustworthy friend, states that some buds of a golden-variegated\r\n    ash, which were inserted into common ashes, all died except one; but\r\n    the ash-stocks were affected,[923] and produced, both above and below\r\n    the points of insertion of the plates of bark bearing the dead buds,\r\n    shoots which bore variegated leaves. Mr. J. Anderson Henry has\r\n    communicated to me a nearly similar case: Mr. Brown, of Perth, observed\r\n    many years ago, in a Highland glen, an ash-tree with yellow leaves; and\r\n    buds taken from this tree were inserted into common ashes, which in\r\n    consequence were affected, and produced the _Blotched Breadalbane Ash_.\r\n    This variety has been propagated, and has preserved its character\r\n    during the last fifty years. Weeping ashes, also, were budded on the\r\n    affected stocks, and became similarly variegated. Many authors consider\r\n    variegation as the result of disease; and on this view, which however\r\n    is doubtful, for some variegated plants are perfectly healthy and\r\n    vigorous, the foregoing cases may be looked at as the direct result of\r\n    the inoculation of a disease. Variegation is much influenced, as we\r\n    shall hereafter see, by the nature of the soil in which the {395}\r\n    plants are grown; and it does not seem improbable that whatever change\r\n    in the sap or tissues certain soils induce, whether or not called a\r\n    disease, might spread from the inserted piece of bark to the stock. But\r\n    a change of this kind cannot be considered to be of the nature of a\r\n    graft-hybrid.\r\n\r\n    There is a variety of the hazel with dark-purple leaves, like those of\r\n    the copper-beech: no one has attributed this colour to disease, and it\r\n    apparently is only an exaggeration of a tint which may often be seen on\r\n    the leaves of the common hazel. When this variety is grafted on the\r\n    common hazel,[924] it sometimes colours, as has been asserted, the\r\n    leaves below the graft; but I should add that Mr. Rivers, who has\r\n    possessed hundreds of such grafted trees, has never seen an instance.\r\n\r\n    Gärtner[925] quotes two separate accounts of branches of dark and\r\n    white-fruited vines which had been united in various ways, such as\r\n    being split longitudinally, and then joined, &c.; and these branches\r\n    produced distinct bunches of grapes of the two colours, and other\r\n    bunches with grapes either striped or of an intermediate and new tint.\r\n    Even the leaves in one case were variegated. These facts are the more\r\n    remarkable because Andrew Knight never succeeded in raising variegated\r\n    grapes by fertilising white kinds by pollen of dark kinds; though, as\r\n    we have seen, he obtained seedlings with variegated fruit and leaves,\r\n    by fertilising a white variety by the variegated dark Aleppo grape.\r\n    Gärtner attributes the above-quoted cases merely to bud-variation; but\r\n    it is a strange coincidence that the branches which had been grafted in\r\n    a peculiar manner should alone have thus varied; and H. Adorne de\r\n    Tscharner positively asserts that he produced the described result more\r\n    than once, and could do so at will, by splitting and uniting the\r\n    branches in the manner described by him.\r\n\r\n    I should not have quoted the following case had not the author of 'Des\r\n    Jacinthes'[926] impressed me with the belief not only of his extensive\r\n    knowledge, but of his truthfulness: he says that bulbs of blue and red\r\n    hyacinths may be cut in two, and that they will grow together and throw\r\n    up a united stem (and this I have myself seen), with flowers of the two\r\n    colours on the opposite sides. But the remarkable point is, that\r\n    flowers are sometimes produced with the two colours blended together,\r\n    which makes the case closely analogous with that of the blended colours\r\n    of the grapes on the united vine-branches.\r\n\r\n    Mr. E. Trail stated in 1867, before the Botanical Society of Edinburgh\r\n    (and has since given me fuller information), that several years ago he\r\n    cut about sixty blue and white potatoes into halves through the eyes or\r\n    buds, and then carefully joined them, destroying at the same time the\r\n    other eyes. Some of these united tubers produced white, and others blue\r\n    tubers; and it is probable that in these cases the one half alone of\r\n    the bud grew. Some, however, produced tubers partly white and partly\r\n    blue; and the tubers from about four or five were regularly mottled\r\n    with the two colours. in these latter cases we may conclude that a stem\r\n    had been formed by {396} the union of the bisected buds; and as tubers\r\n    are produced by the enlargement of subterranean branches arising from\r\n    the main stem, their mottled colour apparently affords clear evidence\r\n    of the intimate commingling of the two varieties. I have repeated these\r\n    experiments on the potato and on the hyacinth on a large scale, but\r\n    with no success.\r\n\r\n    The most reliable instance known to me of the formation of a\r\n    graft-hybrid is one, recorded by Mr. Poynter,[927] who assures me, in a\r\n    letter of the entire accuracy of the statement, _Rosa Devoniensis_ had\r\n    been budded some years previously on a white Banksian rose; and from\r\n    the much enlarged point of junction, whence the Devoniensis and\r\n    Banksian still continued to grow, a third branch issued, which was\r\n    neither pure Banksian nor pure Devoniensis, but partook of the\r\n    character of both; the flowers resembled, but were superior in\r\n    character to those of the variety called _Lamarque_ (one of the\r\n    Noisettes), while the shoots were similar in their manner of growth to\r\n    those of the Banksian rose, with the exception that the longer and more\r\n    robust shoots were furnished with prickles. This rose was exhibited\r\n    before the Floral Committee of the Horticultural Society of London. Dr.\r\n    Lindley examined it, and concluded that it had certainly been produced\r\n    by the mingling of _R. Banksiæ_ with some rose like _R. Devoniensis_,\r\n    \"for while it was very greatly increased in vigour and in the size of\r\n    all the parts, the leaves were half-way between a Banksian and\r\n    Tea-scented rose.\" It appears that rose-growers were aware that the\r\n    Banksian rose sometimes affects other roses. Had it not been for this\r\n    latter statement, it might have been suspected that this new variety\r\n    was simply due to bud-variation, and that it had occurred by a mere\r\n    accident at the point of junction between the two old kinds.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the foregoing facts: the statement that _Cytisus adami_\r\noriginated as a graft-hybrid is so precise that it can hardly be rejected,\r\nand, as we have just seen, some analogous facts render the statement to a\r\ncertain extent probable. The peculiar, monstrous condition of the ovules,\r\nand the apparently sound condition of the pollen, favour the belief that it\r\nis not an ordinary or seminal hybrid. On the other hand, the fact that the\r\nsame two species, viz. _C. laburnum_ and _purpureus_, have spontaneously\r\nproduced hybrids by seed, is a strong argument in support of the belief\r\nthat C. _adami_ originated in a similar manner. With respect to the\r\nextraordinary tendency which this tree exhibits to complete or partial\r\nreversion, we have seen that undoubted seminal hybrids and mongrels are\r\nsimilarly liable. On the whole, I am inclined to put trust in M. Adam's\r\nstatement; and if it should ever be proved true, the same view would\r\nprobably have {397} to be extended to the Bizzarria and Trifacial oranges\r\nand to the apples above described; but more evidence is requisite before\r\nthe possibility of the production of graft-hybrids can be fully admitted.\r\nAlthough it is at present impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion\r\nwith respect to the origin of these remarkable trees, the various facts\r\nabove given appear to me to deserve attention under several points of view,\r\nmore especially as showing that the power of reversion is inherent in Buds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_On the direct or immediate action of the Male Element on the Mother\r\nForm._--Another remarkable class of facts must be here considered, because\r\nthey have been supposed to account for some cases of bud-variation: I refer\r\nto the direct action of the male element, not in the ordinary way on the\r\novules, but on certain parts of the female plant, or in the case of animals\r\non the subsequent progeny of the female by a second male. I may premise\r\nthat with plants the ovarium and the coats of the ovules are obviously\r\nparts of the female, and it could not have been anticipated that they would\r\nbe affected by the pollen of a foreign variety or species, although the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo, within the embryonic sack, within the ovule,\r\nwithin the ovarium, of course depends on the male element.\r\n\r\n    Even as long ago as 1729 it was observed[928] that white and blue\r\n    varieties of the Pea, when planted near each other, mutually crossed,\r\n    no doubt through the agency of bees, and in the autumn blue and white\r\n    peas were found within the same pods. Wiegmann made an exactly similar\r\n    observation in the present century. The same result has followed\r\n    several times when a variety with peas of one colour has been\r\n    artificially crossed by a differently-coloured variety.[929] These\r\n    statements led Gärtner, who was highly sceptical on the subject,\r\n    carefully to try a long series of experiments: he selected the most\r\n    constant varieties, and the result conclusively showed that the colour\r\n    of the skin of the pea is modified when pollen of a differently\r\n    coloured variety is used. This conclusion has since been confirmed by\r\n    experiments made by the Rev. J. M. Berkeley.[930]\r\n\r\n    Mr. Laxton of Stamford, whilst making experiments on peas for the\r\n    express purpose of ascertaining the influence of foreign pollen on the\r\n    mother-plant, has recently[931] observed an important additional fact.\r\n    He fertilised the Tall Sugar pea, which bears very thin green pods,\r\n    becoming {398} brownish-white when dry, with pollen of the\r\n    Purple-podded pea, which, as its name expresses, has dark-purple pods\r\n    with very thick skin, becoming pale reddish-purple when dry. Mr. Laxton\r\n    has cultivated the tall sugar-pea during twenty years, and has never\r\n    seen or heard of it producing a purple pod; nevertheless, a flower\r\n    fertilised by pollen from the purple-pod yielded a pod clouded with\r\n    purplish-red, which Mr. Laxton kindly gave to me. A space of about two\r\n    inches in length towards the extremity of the pod, and a smaller space\r\n    near the stalk, were thus coloured. On comparing the colour with that\r\n    of the purple-pod, both pods having been first dried and then soaked in\r\n    water, it was found to be identically the same; and in both the colour\r\n    was confined to the cells lying immediately beneath the outer skin of\r\n    the pod. The valves of the crossed pod were also decidedly thicker and\r\n    stronger than those of the pods of the mother-plant, but this may have\r\n    been an accidental circumstance, for I know not how far their thickness\r\n    in the Tall Sugar-pea is a variable character.\r\n\r\n    The peas of the Tall Sugar-pea, when dry, are pale greenish-brown,\r\n    thickly covered with dots of dark purple so minute as to be visible\r\n    only through a lens, and Mr. Laxton has never seen or heard of this\r\n    variety producing a purple pea; but in the crossed pod one of the peas\r\n    was of a uniform beautiful violet-purple tint, and a second was\r\n    irregularly clouded with pale purple. The colour lies in the outer of\r\n    the two coats which surround the pea. As the peas of the purple-podded\r\n    variety when dry are of a pale greenish-buff, it would at first appear\r\n    that this remarkable change of colour in the peas in the crossed pod\r\n    could not have been caused by the direct action of the pollen of the\r\n    purple-pod: but when we bear in mind that this latter variety has\r\n    purple flowers, purple marks on its stipules, and purple pods; and that\r\n    the Tall sugar-pea likewise has purple flowers and stipules, and\r\n    microscopically minute purple dots on the peas, we can hardly doubt\r\n    that the tendency to the production of purple in both parents has in\r\n    combination modified the colour of the peas in the crossed pod. After\r\n    having examined these specimens, I crossed the same two varieties, and\r\n    the peas in one pod, but not the pods themselves, were clouded and\r\n    tinted with purplish-red in a much more conspicuous manner than the\r\n    peas in the uncrossed pods produced at the same time by the same\r\n    plants. I may notice as a caution that Mr. Laxton sent me various other\r\n    crossed peas slightly, or even greatly, modified in colour; but the\r\n    change in these cases was due, as had been suspected by Mr. Laxton, to\r\n    the altered colour of the cotyledons, seen through the transparent\r\n    coats of the peas; and as the cotyledons are parts of the embryo, these\r\n    cases are not in any way remarkable.\r\n\r\n    Turning now to the genus Matthiola. The pollen of one kind of stock\r\n    sometimes affects the colour of the seeds of another kind, used as the\r\n    mother-plant. I give the following case the more readily, as Gärtner\r\n    doubted similar statements with respect to the stock previously made by\r\n    other observers. A well-known horticulturist, Major Trevor Clarke,\r\n    informs me[932] that the seeds of the large red-flowered _biennial_\r\n    stock {399} (_Matthiola annua_; _Cocardeau_ of the French) are light\r\n    brown, and those of the purple branching Queen stock (_M. incana_) are\r\n    violet-black; and he found that, when flowers of the red stock were\r\n    fertilised by pollen from the purple stock, they yielded about fifty\r\n    per cent. of _black_ seeds. He sent me four pods from a red-flowered\r\n    plant, two of which had been fertilised by their own pollen, and they\r\n    included pale brown seed; and two which had been crossed by pollen from\r\n    the purple kind, and they included seeds all deeply tinged with black.\r\n    These latter seeds yielded purple-flowered plants like their father;\r\n    whilst the pale brown seeds yielded normal red-flowered plants; and\r\n    Major Clarke, by sowing similar seeds, has observed on a greater scale\r\n    the same result. The evidence in this case of the direct action of the\r\n    pollen of one species on the colour of the seeds of another species\r\n    appears to me conclusive.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases, with the exception of that of the purple-podded\r\npea, the coats of the seeds alone have been affected in colour. We shall\r\nnow see that the ovarium itself, whether forming a large fleshy fruit or a\r\nmere thin envelope, may be modified by foreign pollen, in colour, flavour,\r\ntexture, size, and shape.\r\n\r\n    The most remarkable instance, because carefully recorded by highly\r\n    competent authorities, is one of which I have seen an account in a\r\n    letter written, in 1867, by M. Naudin to Dr. Hooker. M. Naudin states\r\n    that he has seen fruit growing on _Chamærops humilis_, which had been\r\n    fertilised by M. Denis with pollen from the Phoenix or date-palm. The\r\n    fruit or drupe thus produced was twice as large as, and more elongated\r\n    than, that proper to the Chamærops; so that it was intermediate in\r\n    these respects, as well as in texture, between the fruit of the two\r\n    parents. These hybridised seeds germinated, and produced young plants\r\n    likewise intermediate in character. This case is the more remarkable as\r\n    the Chamærops and Phoenix belong not only to distinct genera, but in\r\n    the estimation of some botanists to distinct sections of the family.\r\n\r\n    Gallesio[933] fertilised the flowers of an orange with pollen from the\r\n    lemon; and one fruit thus produced bore a longitudinal stripe of peel\r\n    having the colour, flavour, and other characters of the lemon. Mr.\r\n    Anderson[934] fertilised a green-fleshed melon with pollen from a\r\n    scarlet-fleshed kind; in two of the fruits \"a sensible change was\r\n    perceptible; and four other fruits were somewhat altered both\r\n    internally and externally.\" The seeds of the two first-mentioned fruits\r\n    produced plants partaking of the good properties of both parents. In\r\n    the United States, where Cucurbitaceæ are largely cultivated, it is the\r\n    popular belief[935] that the fruit is thus directly affected by foreign\r\n    pollen; and I have received a similar statement with respect to {400}\r\n    the cucumber in England. It is known that grapes have been thus\r\n    affected in colour, size, and shape: in France a pale-coloured grape\r\n    had its juice tinted by the pollen of the dark-coloured Teinturier; in\r\n    Germany a variety bore berries which were affected by the pollen of two\r\n    adjoining kinds; some of the berries being only partially affected or\r\n    mottled.[936] As long ago as 1751[937] it was observed that, when\r\n    differently coloured varieties of maize grow near each other, they\r\n    mutually affect each other's seeds, and this is now a popular belief in\r\n    the United States. Dr. Savi[938] tried the experiment with care: he\r\n    sowed yellow and black-seeded maize together, and on the same ear some\r\n    of the seeds were yellow, some black, and some mottled,[939] the\r\n    differently coloured seeds being arranged in rows or irregularly. Mr.\r\n    Sabine states[940] that he has seen the form of the nearly globular\r\n    seed-capsule of _Amaryllis vittata_ altered by the application of the\r\n    pollen of another species, of which the capsule has gibbous angles. Mr.\r\n    J. Anderson Henry[941] crossed _Rhododendron Dalhousiæ_ with the pollen\r\n    of _R. Nuttallii_, which is one of the largest-flowered and noblest\r\n    species of the genus. The largest pod produced by the former species,\r\n    when fertilised with its own pollen, measured 1-2/8 inch in length and\r\n    1½ in girth; whilst three of the pods which had been fertilised by\r\n    pollen of _R. Nuttallii_ measured 1-5/8 inch in length and no less than\r\n    2 inches in girth. Here we see the effect of foreign pollen apparently\r\n    confined to increasing the size of the ovarium; but we must be cautious\r\n    in assuming, as the following case shows, that in this instance size\r\n    has been directly transferred from the male parent to the capsule of\r\n    the female plant. Mr. Henry fertilised _Arabis blepharophylla_ with\r\n    pollen of _A. Soyeri_, and the pods thus produced, of which he was so\r\n    kind as to send me detailed measurements and sketches, were much larger\r\n    in all their dimensions than those naturally produced by either the\r\n    male or female parent-species. In a future chapter we shall see {401}\r\n    that the organs of vegetation in hybrid plants, independently of the\r\n    character of either parent, are sometimes developed to a monstrous\r\n    size; and the increased size of the pods in the foregoing cases may be\r\n    an analogous fact.\r\n\r\n    No case of the direct action of the pollen of one variety on another is\r\n    better authenticated or more remarkable than that of the common apple.\r\n    The fruit here consists of the lower part of the calyx and of the upper\r\n    part of the flower-peduncle[942] in a metamorphosed condition, so that\r\n    the effect of the foreign pollen has extended even beyond the limits of\r\n    the ovarium. Cases of apples thus affected were recorded by Bradley in\r\n    the early part of the last century; and other cases are given in old\r\n    volumes of the Philosophical Transactions;[943] in one of these a\r\n    Russeting apple and an adjoining kind mutually affected each other's\r\n    fruit; and in another case a smooth apple affected a rough-coated kind.\r\n    Another instance has been given[944] of two very different apple-trees\r\n    growing close to each other, which bore fruit resembling each other,\r\n    but only on the adjoining branches. It is, however, almost superfluous\r\n    to adduce these or other cases, after that of the St. Valery apple,\r\n    which, from the abortion of the stamens, does not produce pollen, but,\r\n    being annually fertilised by the girls of the neighbourhood with pollen\r\n    of many kinds, bears fruit, \"differing from each other in size,\r\n    flavour, and colour, but resembling in character the hermaphrodite\r\n    kinds by which they have been fertilised.\"[945]\r\n\r\nI have now shown, on the authority of several excellent observers, in the\r\ncase of plants belonging to widely different orders, that the pollen of one\r\nspecies or variety, when applied to a distinct form, occasionally causes\r\nthe coats of the seeds and the ovarium or fruit, including even in one\r\ninstance the calyx and upper part of the peduncle of the mother-plant, to\r\nbecome modified. Sometimes the whole of the ovarium or all the seeds are\r\nthus affected; sometimes only a certain number of the seeds, as in the case\r\nof the pea, or only a part of the ovarium, as with the striped orange,\r\nmottled grapes and maize, are thus affected. It must not be supposed that\r\nany direct or immediate effect invariably follows the use of foreign\r\npollen: this is far from being the case; nor is it known on what conditions\r\nthe result depends. Mr. Knight[946] expressly states that he has never seen\r\n{402} the fruit thus affected, though he has crossed thousands of apple and\r\nother fruit-trees. There is not the least reason to believe that a branch\r\nwhich has borne seed or fruit directly modified by foreign pollen is itself\r\naffected, so as subsequently to produce modified buds: such an occurrence,\r\nfrom the temporary connection of the flower with the stem, would be hardly\r\npossible. Hence but very few, if any, of the cases of sudden modifications\r\nin the fruit of trees, given in the early part of this chapter, can be\r\naccounted for by the action of foreign pollen; for such modified fruits\r\nhave commonly been afterwards propagated by budding or grafting. It is also\r\nobvious that changes of colour in the flower which necessarily supervene\r\nlong before it is ready for fertilisation, and changes in the shape or\r\ncolour of the leaves, can have no relation to the action of foreign pollen:\r\nall such cases must be attributed to simple bud-variation.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of the action of foreign pollen on the mother-plant have been\r\ngiven in considerable detail, because this action, as we shall see in a\r\nfuture chapter, is of the highest theoretical importance, and because it is\r\nin itself a remarkable and apparently anomalous circumstance. That it is\r\nremarkable under a physiological point of view is clear, for the male\r\nelement not only affects, in accordance with its proper function, the germ,\r\nbut the surrounding tissues of the mother-plant. That the action is\r\nanomalous in appearance is true, but hardly so in reality, for apparently\r\nit plays the same part in the ordinary fertilisation of many flowers.\r\nGärtner has shown,[947] by gradually increasing the number of pollen-grains\r\nuntil he succeeded in fertilising a Malva, that many grains are expended in\r\nthe development, or, as he expresses it, in the satiation, of the pistil\r\nand ovarium. Again, when one plant is fertilised by a widely distinct\r\nspecies, it often happens that the ovarium is fully and quickly developed\r\nwithout any seeds being formed, or the coats of the seeds are developed\r\nwithout an embryo being formed within. Dr. Hildebrand also has lately shown\r\nin a valuable paper[948] that, with several Orchideæ, the action of the\r\nplant's own {403} pollen is necessary for the development of the ovarium,\r\nand that this development takes place not only long before the pollen-tubes\r\nhave reached the ovules, but even before the placentæ and ovules have been\r\nformed; so that with these orchids the pollen apparently acts directly on\r\nthe ovarium. On the other hand, we must not overrate the efficacy of pollen\r\nin this respect; for in the case of hybridised plants it might be argued\r\nthat an embryo had been formed and had affected the surrounding tissues of\r\nthe mother-plant before it perished at a very early age. Again, it is well\r\nknown that with many plants the ovarium may be fully developed, though\r\npollen be wholly excluded. And lastly, Mr. Smith, the late Curator at Kew\r\n(as I hear through Dr. Hooker), observed the singular fact with an orchid,\r\nthe _Bonatea speciosa_, the development of the ovarium could be effected by\r\nmechanical irritation of the stigma. Nevertheless, from the number of the\r\npollen-grains expended \"in the satiation of the ovarium and pistil,\"--from\r\nthe generality of the formation of the ovarium and seed-coats in sterile\r\nhybridised plants,--and from Dr. Hildebrand's observations on orchids, we\r\nmay admit that in most cases the swelling of the ovarium, and the formation\r\nof the seed-coats, are at least aided, if not wholly caused, by the direct\r\naction of the pollen, independently of the intervention of the fertilised\r\ngerm. Therefore, in the previously-given cases we have only to add to our\r\nbelief in the power of the plant's own pollen on the development of the\r\novarium and seed-coats, its further power, when applied to a distinct\r\nspecies or variety, of influencing the shape, size, colour, texture, &c.,\r\nof these same parts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTurning now to the animal kingdom. If we could imagine the same flower to\r\nyield seeds during successive years, then it would not be very surprising\r\nthat a flower of which the ovarium had been modified by foreign pollen\r\nshould next year produce, when self-fertilised, offspring modified by the\r\nprevious male influence. Closely analogous cases have actually occurred\r\nwith animals. In the case often quoted from Lord Morton,[949] a nearly\r\npurely-bred, Arabian, chesnut mare bore a hybrid to a quagga; she was\r\nsubsequently sent to Sir Gore Ouseley, and produced {404} two colts by a\r\nblack Arabian horse. These colts were partially dun-coloured, and were\r\nstriped on the legs more plainly than the real hybrid, or even than the\r\nquagga. One of the two colts had its neck and some other parts of its body\r\nplainly marked with stripes. Stripes on the body, not to mention those on\r\nthe legs, and the dun-colour, are extremely rare,--I speak after having\r\nlong attended to the subject,--with horses of all kinds in Europe, and are\r\nunknown in the case of Arabians. But what makes the case still more\r\nstriking is that the hair of the mane in these colts resembled that of the\r\nquagga, being short, stiff, and upright. Hence there can be no doubt that\r\nthe quagga affected the character of the offspring subsequently begot by\r\nthe black Arabian horse. With respect to the varieties of our domesticated\r\nanimals, many similar and well-authenticated facts have been\r\npublished,[950] and others have been communicated to me, plainly showing\r\nthe influence of the first male on the progeny subsequently borne by the\r\nmother to other males. It will suffice to give a single instance, recorded\r\nin the 'Philosophical Transactions,' in a paper following that by Lord\r\nMorton: Mr. Giles put a sow of Lord Western's black and white Essex breed\r\nto a wild boar of a deep chesnut colour; and the \"pigs produced partook in\r\nappearance of both boar and sow, but in some the chesnut colour of the boar\r\nstrongly prevailed.\" After the boar had long been dead, the sow was put to\r\na boar of her own black and white breed,--a kind which is well known to\r\nbreed very true and never to show any chesnut colour,--yet from this union\r\nthe sow produced some young pigs which were plainly marked with the same\r\nchesnut tint as in the first litter. Similar cases have so frequently\r\noccurred, that careful breeders avoid putting a choice female to an\r\ninferior male on account of the injury to her subsequent progeny which may\r\nbe expected to follow.\r\n\r\n{405}\r\n\r\nSome physiologists have attempted to account for these remarkable results\r\nfrom a first impregnation by the close attachment and freely\r\nintercommunicating blood-vessels between the modified embryo and the\r\nmother. But it is a most improbable hypothesis that the mere blood of one\r\nindividual should affect the reproductive organs of another individual in\r\nsuch a manner as to modify the subsequent offspring. The analogy from the\r\ndirect action of foreign pollen on the ovarium and seed-coats of the\r\nmother-plant strongly supports the belief that the male element acts\r\ndirectly on the reproductive organs of the female, wonderful as is this\r\naction, and not through the intervention of the crossed embryo. With birds\r\nthere is no such close connection between the embryo and mother as in the\r\ncase of mammals: yet a careful observer, Dr. Chapuis, states[951] that with\r\npigeons the influence of a first male sometimes makes itself perceived in\r\nthe succeeding broods; but this statement, before it can be fully trusted,\r\nrequires confirmation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Conclusion and Summary of the Chapter._--The facts given in the latter\r\nhalf of this chapter are well worthy of consideration, as they show us in\r\nhow many extraordinary modes one organic form may lead to the modification\r\nof another, and often without the intervention of seminal reproduction.\r\nThere is ample evidence, as we have just seen, that the male element may\r\neither directly affect the structure of the female, or in the case of\r\nanimals lead to the modification of her offspring. There is a considerable\r\nbut insufficient body of evidence showing that the tissues of two plants\r\nmay unite and form a bud having a blended character; or again, that buds\r\ninserted into a stock may affect all the buds subsequently produced by this\r\nstock. Two embryos, differing from each other and contained in the same\r\nseed, may cohere and form a single plant. Offspring from a cross between\r\ntwo species or varieties may in the first or in a succeeding generation\r\nrevert in various degrees by bud-variation to their parent-forms; and this\r\nreversion or segregation of character may affect the whole flower, fruit,\r\nor leaf-bud, or only the half or smaller segment, or a single organ. In\r\nsome cases this segregation of character apparently depends on some {406}\r\nincapacity of union rather than on reversion, for the flowers or fruit\r\nwhich are first produced display by segments the characters of both\r\nparents. In the _Cytisus adami_ and the Bizzarria orange, whatever their\r\norigin may have been, the two parent species occur blended together under\r\nthe form of a sterile hybrid, or reappear with their characters perfect and\r\ntheir reproductive organs effective; and these trees, retaining the same\r\nsportive character, can be propagated by buds. These various facts ought to\r\nbe well considered by any one who wishes to embrace under a single point of\r\nview the various modes of reproduction by gemmation, division, and sexual\r\nunion, the reparation of lost parts, variation, inheritance, reversion, and\r\nother such phenomena. In a chapter towards the close of the following\r\nvolume I shall attempt to connect these facts together by a provisional\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn the early half of this chapter I have given a long list of plants in\r\nwhich through bud-variation, that is, independently of reproduction by\r\nseed, the fruit has suddenly become modified in size, colour, flavour,\r\nhairiness, shape, and time of maturity; flowers have similarly changed in\r\nshape, colour, and doubleness, and greatly in the character of the calyx;\r\nyoung branches or shoots have changed in colour, in bearing spines, and in\r\nhabit of growth, as in climbing and weeping; leaves have changed in colour,\r\nvariegation, shape, period of unfolding, and in their arrangement on the\r\naxis. Buds of all kinds, whether produced on ordinary branches or on\r\nsubterranean stems, whether simple or, as in tubers and bulbs, much\r\nmodified and supplied with a stock of nutriment, are all liable to sudden\r\nvariations of the same general nature.\r\n\r\nIn the list, many of the cases are certainly due to reversion to characters\r\nnot acquired from a cross, but which were formerly present, and have been\r\nlost for a longer or shorter period of time;--as when a bud on a variegated\r\nplant produces plain leaves, or when variously-coloured flowers on the\r\nChrysanthemum revert to the aboriginal yellow tint. Many other cases\r\nincluded in the list are probably due to the plants being of crossed\r\nparentage, and to the buds reverting to one of the two parent-forms. In\r\nillustration of the origin of _Cytisus adami_, several cases were given of\r\npartial or complete reversion, both {407} with hybrid and mongrel plants;\r\nhence we may suspect that the strong tendency in the Chrysanthemum, for\r\ninstance, to produce by bud-variation differently-coloured flowers, results\r\nfrom the varieties formerly having been intentionally or accidentally\r\ncrossed; and that their descendants at the present day still occasionally\r\nrevert by buds to the colours of the more persistent parent-varieties. This\r\nis almost certainly the case with Rollisson's Unique Pelargonium; and so it\r\nmay be to a large extent with the bud-varieties of the Dahlia and with the\r\n\"broken colours\" of Tulips.\r\n\r\nMany cases of bud-variation, however, cannot be attributed to reversion,\r\nbut to spontaneous variability, such as so commonly occurs with cultivated\r\nplants when raised from seed. As a single variety of the Chrysanthemum has\r\nproduced by buds six other varieties, and as one variety of the gooseberry\r\nhas borne at the same time four distinct varieties of fruit, it is scarcely\r\npossible to believe that all these variations are reversions to former\r\nparents. We can hardly believe, as remarked in a previous chapter, that all\r\nthe many peaches which have yielded nectarine-buds are of crossed\r\nparentage. Lastly, in such cases as that of the moss-rose with its peculiar\r\ncalyx, and of the rose which bears opposite leaves, in that of the\r\nImatophyllum, &c., there is no known natural species or seedling variety,\r\nfrom which the characters in question could have been derived by crossing.\r\nWe must attribute all such cases to actual variability in the buds. The\r\nvarieties which have thus arisen cannot be distinguished by any external\r\ncharacter from seedlings; this is notoriously the case with the varieties\r\nof the Rose, Azalea, and many other plants. It deserves notice that all the\r\nplants which have yielded bud-variations have likewise varied greatly by\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nThese plants belong to so many orders that we may infer that almost every\r\nplant would be liable to bud-variation if placed under the proper exciting\r\nconditions. These conditions, as far as we can judge, mainly depend on\r\nlong-continued and high cultivation; for almost all the plants in the\r\nforegoing lists are perennials, and have been largely propagated in many\r\nsoils and under different climates, by cuttings, offsets, bulbs, tubers,\r\nand especially by budding or grafting. The instances of annuals varying by\r\nbuds, or producing on the same plant {408} differently coloured flowers,\r\nare comparatively rare: Hopkirk[952] has seen this with _Convolvulus\r\ntricolor_; and it is not rare with the Balsam and annual Delphinium.\r\nAccording to Sir R. Schomburgk, plants from the warmer temperate regions,\r\nwhen cultivated under the hot climate of St. Domingo, are eminently liable\r\nto bud-variation; but change of climate is by no means a necessary\r\ncontingent, as we see with the gooseberry, currant, and some others. Plants\r\nliving under their natural conditions are very rarely subject to\r\nbud-variation: variegated and coloured leaves have, however, been\r\noccasionally observed; and I have given an instance of the variation of\r\nbuds on an ash-tree; but it is doubtful whether any tree planted in\r\nornamental grounds can be considered as living under strictly natural\r\nconditions. Gärtner has seen white and dark-red flowers produced from the\r\nsame root of the wild _Achillea millefolium_; and Prof. Caspary has seen\r\n_Viola lutea_, in a completely wild condition, bearing flowers of different\r\ncolours and sizes.[953]\r\n\r\nAs wild plants are so rarely liable to bud-variation, whilst highly\r\ncultivated plants long propagated by artificial means have yielded by this\r\nform of reproduction many varieties, we are led through a series such as\r\nthe following,--namely, all the eyes in the same tuber of the potato\r\nvarying in the same manner,--all the fruit on a purple plum-tree suddenly\r\nbecoming yellow,--all the fruit on a double-flowered almond suddenly\r\nbecoming peach-like,--all the buds on grafted trees being in some very\r\nslight degree affected by the stock on which they have been worked,--all\r\nthe flowers on a transplanted heartsease changing for a time in colour,\r\nsize, and shape,--we are led through such facts to look at every case of\r\nbud-variation as the direct result of the particular conditions of life to\r\nwhich the plant has been exposed. But if we turn to the other end of the\r\nseries, namely, to such cases as that of a peach-tree which, after having\r\nbeen cultivated by tens of thousands during many years in many countries,\r\nand after having annually produced thousands of buds, all of which have\r\napparently been exposed to precisely the same conditions, yet at last\r\nsuddenly produces a single bud with its whole character greatly\r\ntransformed, we are driven to an opposite {409} conclusion. In such cases\r\nas the latter it would appear that the transformation stands in no _direct_\r\nrelation to the conditions of life.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that varieties produced from seeds and from buds resemble each\r\nother so closely in general appearance, that they cannot possibly be\r\ndistinguished. Just as certain species and groups of species, when\r\npropagated by seed, are more variable than other species or genera, so it\r\nis in the case of certain bud-varieties. Thus the Queen of England\r\nChrysanthemum has produced by this latter process no less than six, and\r\nRollisson's Unique Pelargonium four distinct varieties; moss-roses have\r\nalso produced several other moss-roses. The Rosaceæ have varied by buds\r\nmore than any other group of plants; but this may be in large part due to\r\nso many members having been long cultivated; but within this one group, the\r\npeach has often varied by buds, whilst the apple and pear, both grafted\r\ntrees extensively cultivated, have afforded, as far as I can ascertain,\r\nextremely few instances of bud-variation.\r\n\r\nThe law of analogous variation holds good with varieties produced by buds,\r\nas with those produced from seed: more than one kind of rose has sported\r\ninto a moss-rose; more than one kind of camellia has assumed an hexagonal\r\nform; and at least seven or eight varieties of the peach have produced\r\nnectarines.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance seem to be nearly the same with seminal and\r\nbud-varieties. We know how commonly reversion comes into play with both,\r\nand it may affect the whole, or only segments, of a leaf, flower, or fruit.\r\nWhen the tendency to reversion affects many buds on the same tree, it\r\nbecomes covered with different kinds of leaves, flowers, or fruit; but\r\nthere is reason to believe that such fluctuating varieties have generally\r\narisen from seed. It is well known that, out of a number of seedling\r\nvarieties, some transmit their character much more truly by seed than\r\nothers; so with bud-varieties some retain their character by successive\r\nbuds more truly than others; of which instances have been given with two\r\nkinds of variegated Euonymus and with certain kinds of tulips.\r\nNotwithstanding the sudden production of bud-varieties, the characters thus\r\nacquired are sometimes capable of transmission by seminal reproduction: Mr.\r\nRivers has found that moss-roses generally {410} reproduce themselves by\r\nseed; and the mossy character has been transferred by crossing, from one\r\nspecies of rose to another. The Boston nectarine, which appeared as a\r\nbud-variation, produced by seed a closely allied nectarine. We have however\r\nseen, on the authority of Mr. Salter, that seed taken from a branch with\r\nleaves variegated through bud-variation, transmits this character very\r\nfeebly; whilst many plants, which became variegated as seedlings, transmit\r\nvariegation to a large proportion of their progeny.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been able to collect a good many cases of bud-variation, as\r\nshown in the previous lists, and might probably, by searching foreign\r\nhorticultural works, have collected more cases, yet their total number is\r\nas nothing in comparison with that of seminal varieties. With seedlings\r\nraised from the more variable cultivated plants, the variations are almost\r\ninfinitely numerous, but their differences are generally slight: only at\r\nlong intervals of time a strongly marked modification appears. On the other\r\nhand, it is a singular and inexplicable fact that, when plants vary by\r\nbuds, the variations, though they occur with comparative rarity, are often,\r\nor even generally, strongly pronounced. It struck me that this might\r\nperhaps be a delusion, and that slight changes often occurred in buds, but\r\nfrom being of no value were overlooked or not recorded. Accordingly I\r\napplied to two great authorities on this subject, namely, to Mr. Rivers\r\nwith respect to fruit-trees, and to Mr. Salter with respect to flowers. Mr.\r\nRivers is doubtful, but does not remember having noticed very slight\r\nvariations in fruit-buds. Mr. Salter informs me that with flowers such do\r\noccur, but, if propagated, they generally lose their new character in the\r\nfollowing year; yet he concurs with me that bud-variations usually at once\r\nassume a decided and permanent character. We can hardly doubt that this is\r\nthe rule, when we reflect on such cases as that of the peach, which has\r\nbeen so carefully observed and of which such trifling seminal varieties\r\nhave been propagated, yet this tree has repeatedly produced by\r\nbud-variation nectarines, and only twice (as far as I can learn) any other\r\nvariety, namely, the Early and Late Grosse Mignonne peaches; and these\r\ndiffer from the parent-tree in hardly any character except the period of\r\nmaturity. {411}\r\n\r\nTo my surprise I hear from Mr. Salter that he brings the great principle of\r\nselection to bear on variegated plants propagated by buds, and has thus\r\ngreatly improved and fixed several varieties. He informs me that at first a\r\nbranch often produces variegated leaves on one side alone, and that the\r\nleaves are marked only with an irregular edging or with a few lines of\r\nwhite and yellow. To improve and fix such varieties, he finds it necessary\r\nto encourage the buds at the bases of the most distinctly marked leaves,\r\nand to propagate from them alone. By following with perseverance this plan\r\nduring three or four successive seasons, a distinct and fixed variety can\r\ngenerally be secured.\r\n\r\nFinally, the facts given in this chapter prove in how close and remarkable\r\na manner the germ of a fertilised seed and the small cellular mass forming\r\na bud resemble each other in function,--in their powers of inheritance with\r\noccasional reversion,--and in their capacity for variation of the same\r\ngeneral nature, in obedience to the same laws. This resemblance, or rather\r\nidentity, is rendered far more striking if the facts can be trusted which\r\napparently render it probable that the cellular tissue of one species or\r\nvariety, when budded or grafted on another, may give rise to a bud having\r\nan intermediate character. In this chapter we clearly see that variability\r\nis not necessarily contingent on sexual generation, though much more\r\nfrequently its concomitant than on bud-reproduction. We see that\r\nbud-variability is not solely dependent on reversion or atavism to\r\nlong-lost characters, or to those formerly acquired from a cross, but that\r\nit is often spontaneous. But when we ask ourselves what is the cause of any\r\nparticular bud-variation, we are lost in doubt, being driven in some cases\r\nto look to the direct action of the external conditions of life as\r\nsufficient, and in other cases to feel a profound conviction that these\r\nhave played a quite subordinate part, of not more importance than the\r\nnature of the spark which ignites a mass of combustible matter.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

As I stated that work that I should soon\r\npublish the facts on which the conclusions given in it were founded, I here\r\nbeg permission to remark that the great delay in publishing this first work\r\nhas been caused by continued ill-health.\r\n\r\n[2] M. Pouchet has recently ('Plurality of Races,' Eng. Translat., 1864, p.\r\n83, &c.) insisted that variation under domestication throws no light on the\r\nnatural modification of species. I cannot perceive the force of his\r\narguments, or, to speak more accurately, of his assertions to this effect.\r\n\r\n[3] Léon Dufour in 'Annales des Scienc. Nat.' (3rd series, Zoolog.), tom.\r\nv. p. 6.\r\n\r\n[4] In treating the several subjects included in the present and succeeding\r\nworks I have continually been led to ask for information from many\r\nzoologists, botanists, geologists, breeders of animals, and\r\nhorticulturists, and I have invariably received from them the most generous\r\nassistance. Without such aid I could have effected little. I have\r\nrepeatedly applied for information and specimens to foreigners, and to\r\nBritish merchants and officers of the Government residing in distant lands,\r\nand, with the rarest exceptions, I have received prompt, open-handed, and\r\nvaluable assistance. I cannot express too strongly my obligations to the\r\nmany persons who have assisted me, and who, I am convinced, would be\r\nequally willing to assist others in any scientific investigation.\r\n\r\n[5] Owen, 'British Fossil Mammals,' p. 123 to 133. Pictet's 'Traité de\r\nPal.,' 1853, tom. i. p. 202. De Blainville, in his 'Ostéographie, Canidæ,'\r\np. 142, has largely discussed the whole subject, and concludes that the\r\nextinct parent of all domesticated dogs came nearest to the wolf in\r\norganization, and to the jackal in habits.\r\n\r\n[6] Pallas, I believe, originated this doctrine in 'Act. Acad. St.\r\nPetersburgh,' 1780, Part ii. Ehrenberg has advocated it, as may be seen in\r\nDe Blainville's 'Ostéographie,' p. 79. It has been carried to an extreme\r\nextent by Col. Hamilton Smith in the 'Naturalist Library,' vol. ix. and x.\r\nMr. W. C. Martin adopts it in his excellent 'History of the Dog,' 1845; as\r\ndoes Dr. Morton, as well as Nott and Gliddon, in the United States. Prof.\r\nLow, in his 'Domesticated Animals,' 1845, p. 666, comes to this same\r\nconclusion. No one has argued on this side with more clearness and force\r\nthan the late James Wilson, of Edinburgh, in various papers read before the\r\nHighland Agricultural and Wernerian Societies. Isidore Geoffroy Saint\r\nHilaire ('Hist. Nat. Gén.,' 1860, tom. iii. p. 107), though he believes\r\nthat most dogs have descended from the jackal, yet inclines to the belief\r\nthat some are descended from the wolf. Prof. Gervais ('Hist. Nat. Mamm.,'\r\n1855, tom. ii. p. 69), referring to the view that all the domestic races\r\nare the modified descendants of a single species, after a long discussion,\r\nsays, \"Cette opinion est, suivant nous du moins, la moins probable.\"\r\n\r\n[7] Berjeau, 'The Varieties of the Dog; in old Sculptures and Pictures,'\r\n1863.

'Youatt\r\non the Dog,' 1845, p. 6. A very full history is given by De Blainville in\r\nhis 'Ostéographie, Canidæ.'\r\n\r\n[8] I have seen drawings of this dog from the tomb of the son of Esar\r\nHaddon, and clay models in the British Museum. Nott and Gliddon, in their\r\n'Types of Mankind,' 1854, p. 393, give a copy of these drawings. This dog\r\nhas been called a Thibetan mastiff, but Mr. H. A. Oldfield, who is familiar\r\nwith the so-called Thibet mastiff, and has examined the drawings in the\r\nBritish Museum, informs me that he considers them different.\r\n\r\n[9] 'Proc. Zoolog.

Martin,\r\nin his 'History of the Dog,' 1845, copies several figures from the Egyptian\r\nmonuments, and speaks with much confidence with respect to their identity\r\nwith still living dogs. Messrs. Nott and Gliddon ('Types of Mankind,' 1854,\r\np. 388) give still more numerous figures. Mr. Gliddon asserts that a\r\ncurl-tailed greyhound, like that represented on the most ancient monuments,\r\nis common in Borneo; but the Rajah, Sir J. Brooke, informs me that no such\r\ndog exists there.\r\n\r\n[12] These, and the following facts on the Danish remains, are taken from\r\nM. Morlot's most interesting memoir in 'Soc. Vaudoise des Sc.

Seeman, in his 'Voyage of\r\nH.M.S. Herald,' 1853, vol. ii. p. 26, says the wolf is often caught by the\r\nEsqimaux for the purpose of crossing with their dogs, and thus adding to\r\ntheir size and strength. M. Lamare-Picquot, in 'Bull. de la Soc.\r\nd'Acclimat.,' tom. vii., 1860, p. 148, gives a good account of the\r\nhalf-bred Esquimaux dogs.\r\n\r\n[19] 'Fauna Boreali-Americana,' 1829, pp. 73, 78, 80.

Hunter shows that the long period of seventy-three days given by\r\nBuffon is easily explained by the bitch having received the dog many times\r\nduring a period of sixteen days ('Phil. Transact.,' 1787, p. 253). Hunter\r\nfound that the gestation of a mongrel from wolf and dog ('Phil. Transact.,'\r\n1759, p. 160) apparently was sixty-three days, for she received the dog\r\nmore than once. The period of a mongrel dog and jackal was fifty-nine days.\r\nFred. Cuvier found the period of gestation of the wolf to be ('Dict. Class.\r\nd'Hist. Nat.,' tom. iv. p. 8) two months and a few days, which agrees with\r\nthe dog. Isid. G. St. Hilaire, who has discussed the whole subject, and\r\nfrom whom I quote Bellingeri, states ('Hist. Nat. Gén.,' tom. iii. p. 112)\r\nthat in the Jardin des Plantes the period of the jackal has been found to\r\nbe from sixty to sixty-three days, exactly as with the dog.\r\n\r\n[46] _See_ Isid.

In all\r\nthe veterinary treatises and papers which I have read, the writers insist\r\nin the strongest terms on the inheritance by the horse of all good and bad\r\ntendencies and qualities.

Nat. Mamm.,' tom. ii. p. 144) has\r\ncollected many facts on this head. For instance, Solomon (Kings, b. i. ch.\r\nx. v. 28) bought horses in Egypt at a high price.\r\n\r\n[126] 'The Field,' July 13th, 1861, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[127] E. Vernon Harcourt, 'Sporting in Algeria,' p. 26.\r\n\r\n[128] I state this from my own observations made during several years on\r\nthe colours of horses. I have seen cream-coloured, light-dun and mouse-dun\r\nhorses dappled, which I mention because it has been stated (Martin,\r\n'History of the Horse,' p. 134) that duns are never dappled. Martin (p.\r\n205) refers to dappled asses. In 'The Farrier' (London, 1828, pp. 453, 455)\r\nthere are some good remarks on the dappling of horses; and likewise in Col.\r\nHamilton Smith on 'The Horse.'\r\n\r\n[129] Some details are given in 'The Farrier,' 1828, pp. 452, 455. One of\r\nthe least ponies I ever saw, of the colour of a mouse, had a conspicuous\r\nspinal stripe. A small Indian chesnut pony had the same stripe, as had a\r\nremarkably heavy chesnut cart-horse. Race-horses often have the spinal\r\nstripe.\r\n\r\n[130] I have received information, through the kindness of the\r\nConsul-General, Mr. J. R. Crowe, from Prof. Boeck, Rasck, and Esmarck, on\r\nthe colours of the Norwegian ponies. _See_, also, 'The Field,' 1861, p.\r\n431.\r\n\r\n[131] Col. Ham. Smith, 'Nat. Lib.,' vol. xii. p. 275.\r\n\r\n[132] Mr. G. Clark, in 'Annal and Mag. of Nat. History,' 2nd series, vol.\r\nii., 1848, p. 363. Mr. Wallace informs me that he saw in Java a dun and\r\nclay-coloured horse with spinal and leg stripes.\r\n\r\n[133] _See_, also, on this point, 'The Field,' July 27th, 1861, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[134] 'The Field,' 1861, pp. 431, 493, 545.\r\n\r\n[135] 'Ueber die Eigenschaften,' &c, 1828, s. 13, 14.\r\n\r\n[136] 'Naturalist's Library,' vol. xii. (1841), pp. 109, 156 to 163, 280,\r\n281. Cream-colour, passing into Isabella (_i.e._ the colour of the dirty\r\nlinen of Queen Isabella), seems to have been common in ancient times. _See_\r\nalso Pallas's account of the wild horses of the East, who speaks of dun and\r\nbrown as the prevalent colours.\r\n\r\n[137] Azara, 'Quadrupèdes du Paraguay,' tom. ii. p. 307; for the colour of\r\nmules, _see_ p. 350. In North America, Catlin (vol. ii. p. 57) describes\r\nthe wild horses, believed to have descended from the Spanish horses of\r\nMexico, as of all colours, black, grey, roan, and roan pied with sorrel. F.\r\nMichaux ('Travels in North America,' Eng. translat., p. 235) describes two\r\nwild horses from Mexico as roan. In the Falkland Islands, where the horse\r\nhas been feral only between 60 and 70 years, I was told that roans and\r\niron-greys were the prevalent colours. These several facts show that horses\r\ndo not generally revert to any uniform colour.\r\n\r\n[138] Dr. Sclater, in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.,' 1862, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[139] W. C.

Soc.,' vol. ii. p. 28) on the difference between\r\ndorsal and lumbar vertebræ depending only on the development of the ribs.\r\nNevertheless the difference in the number of the ribs in pigs deserves\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n[167] 'Edinburgh New Philosoph.

It should be observed that his account\r\ndoes not apply to truly feral pigs; but to pigs long introduced into the\r\ncountry and living in a half-wild state. For the truly feral pigs of\r\nJamaica, _see_ Gosse's 'Sojourn in Jamaica,' 1851, p. 386; and Col.\r\nHamilton Smith, in 'Nat. Library,' vol. ix. p. 93. With respect to Africa,\r\n_see_ Livingstone's 'Expedition to the Zambesi,' 1865, p. 153. The most\r\nprecise statement with respect to the tusks of the West Indian feral boars\r\nis by P. Labat (quoted by Roulin); but this author attributes the state of\r\nthese pigs to descent from a domestic stock which he saw in Spain. Admiral\r\nSulivan, R.N., had ample opportunities of observing the wild pigs on Eagle\r\nIslet in the Falklands; and he informs me that they resembled wild boars\r\nwith bristly ridged backs and large tusks. The pigs which have run wild in\r\nthe province of Buenos Ayres (Rengger, 'Säugethiere,' s. 331) have not\r\nreverted to the wild type. De Blainville ('Ostéographie,' p. 132) refers to\r\ntwo skulls of domestic pigs sent from Patagonia by Al. d'Orbigny, and he\r\nstates that they have the occipital elevation of the wild European boar,\r\nbut that the head altogether is \"plus courte et plus ramassée.\" He refers,\r\nalso, to the skin of a feral pig from North America, and says, \"il\r\nressemble tout à fait à un petit sanglier, mais il est presque tout noir,\r\net peut-être un peu plus ramassé dans ses formes.\"\r\n\r\n[172] Gosse's 'Jamaica,' p. 386, with a quotation from Williamson's\r\n'Oriental Field Sports.'

In parts of India, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Blyth, they breed well.\r\n\r\n[268] Darwin's 'Journal of Researches,' p. 193; and 'Zoology of the Voyage\r\nof the Beagle: Mammalia,' p. 92.\r\n\r\n[269] Kerr's 'Collection of Voyages,' vol. ii. p. 177; p. 205 for Cada\r\nMosto. According to a work published in Lisbon in 1717, entitled 'Historia\r\nInsulana,' written by a Jesuit, the rabbits were turned out in 1420. Some\r\nauthors believe that the island was discovered in 1413.\r\n\r\n[270] Something of the same kind has occurred on the island of Lipari,\r\nwhere, according to Spallanzani ('Voyage dans les deux Siciles,' quoted by\r\nGodron sur l'Espèce, p. 364), a countryman turned out some rabbits which\r\nmultiplied prodigiously, but, says Spallanzani, \"les lapins de l'ile de\r\nLipari sont plus petits que ceux qu'on élève en domesticité.\"\r\n\r\n[271] Waterhouse, 'Nat. Hist. Mammalia,' vol. ii. p. 36.\r\n\r\n[272] These rabbits have run wild for a considerable time in Sandon Park,\r\nand in other places in Staffordshire and Shropshire. They originated, as I\r\nhave been informed by the gamekeeper, from variously-coloured domestic\r\nrabbits which had been turned out. They vary in colour; but many are\r\nsymmetrically coloured, being white with a streak along the spine, and with\r\nthe ears and certain marks about the head of a blackish-grey tint. They\r\nhave rather longer bodies than common rabbits.\r\n\r\n[273] _See_ Prof. Owen's remarks on this subject in his paper on the\r\n'Zoological Significance of the Brain, &c., of Man, &c.,' read before Brit.\r\nAssociation, 1862; with respect to Birds, _see_ 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.,' Jan.\r\n11th, 1848, p. 8.\r\n\r\n[274] This standard is apparently considerably too low, for Dr. Crisp\r\n('Proc. Zoolog. Soc.,' 1861, p. 80) gives 210 grains as the actual weight\r\nof the brain of a hare which weighed 7lbs., and 125 grains as the weight of\r\nthe brain of a rabbit which weighed 3 lbs. 5 oz., that is, the same weight\r\nas the rabbit No. 1 in my list. Now the contents of the skull of rabbit No.\r\n1 in shot is in my table 972 grains; and according to Dr. Crisp's ratio of\r\n125 to 210, the skull of the hare ought to have contained 1632 grains of\r\nshot, instead of only (in the largest hare in my table) 1455 grains.\r\n\r\n[275] The Hon. C. Murray has sent me some very valuable specimens from\r\nPersia; and H.M. Consul, Mr. Keith Abbott, has given me information on the\r\npigeons of the same country. I am deeply indebted to Sir Walter Elliot for\r\nan immense collection of skins from Madras, with much information regarding\r\nthem. Mr. Blyth has freely communicated to me his stores of knowledge on\r\nthis and all other related subjects. The Rajah Sir James Brooke sent me\r\nspecimens from Borneo, as has H.M. Consul, Mr. Swinhoe, from Amoy in China,\r\nand Dr. Daniell from the west coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n[276] Mr. B. P. Brent, well known for his various contributions to poultry\r\nliterature, has aided me in every way during several years; so has Mr.\r\nTegetmeier, with unwearied kindness. This latter gentleman, who is well\r\nknown for his works on poultry, and who has largely bred pigeons, has\r\nlooked over this and the following chapters. Mr. Bult formerly showed me\r\nhis unrivalled collection of Pouters, and gave me specimens. I had access\r\nto Mr. Wicking's collection, which contained a greater assortment of many\r\nkinds than could anywhere else be seen; and he has always aided me with\r\nspecimens and information given in the freest manner. Mr. Haynes and Mr.\r\nCorker have given me specimens of their magnificent Carriers. To Mr.\r\nHarrison Weir I am likewise indebted. Nor must I by any means pass over the\r\nassistance received from Mr. J. M.

Mr. Wallace informs me that in the sub-family of the Treronidæ\r\nthe sexes often differ in vividness of colour.\r\n\r\n[310] I am not sure that I have designated the different kinds of vertebræ\r\ncorrectly: but I observe that different anatomists follow in this respect\r\ndifferent rules, and, as I use the same terms in the comparison of all the\r\nskeletons, this, I hope, will not signify.\r\n\r\n[311] J. M. Eaton's Treatise, edit. 1858, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[312] In an analogous, but converse, manner, certain natural groups of the\r\nColumbidæ, from being more terrestrial in their habits than other allied\r\ngroups, have larger feet. _See_ Prince Bonaparte's 'Coup-d'oeil sur l'Ordre\r\ndes Pigeons.'\r\n\r\n[313] It perhaps deserves notice that besides these five birds two of the\r\neight were barbs, which, as I have shown, must be classed in the same group\r\nwith the long-beaked carriers and runts. Barbs may properly be called\r\nshort-beaked carriers. It would, therefore, appear as if, during the\r\nreduction of their beaks, their wings had retained a little of that excess\r\nof length which is characteristic of their nearest relations and\r\nprogenitors.\r\n\r\n[314] Temminck, 'Hist.

In these same works wild species resembling the chief\r\ndomestic races are often said to exist in various parts of the world, but\r\nsuch species are quite unknown to naturalists.\r\n\r\n[320] Sir E.

Dr. Lawrence Edmondstone informs me that a wild rock-pigeon\r\ncame and settled in his dovecot in Balta Sound in the Shetland Islands, and\r\nbred with his pigeons; he has also given me other instances of the wild\r\nrock-pigeon having been taken young and breeding in captivity.\r\n\r\n[331] 'Annals and Mag. of Nat.

With\r\nrespect to fowls I will give the references in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[334] I have drawn out a long table of the various crosses made by fanciers\r\nbetween the several domestic breeds, but I do not think it worth\r\npublishing. I have myself made for this special purpose many crosses, and\r\nall were perfectly fertile. I have united in one bird five of the most\r\ndistinct races, and with patience I might undoubtedly have thus united all.\r\nThe case of five distinct breeds being blended together with unimpaired\r\nfertility is important, because Gärtner has shown that it is a very\r\ngeneral, though not, as he thought, universal rule, that complex crosses\r\nbetween several species are excessively sterile. I have met with only two\r\nor three cases of reported sterility in the offspring of certain races when\r\ncrossed. Von Pistor ('Das Ganze der Feld-taubenzucht,' 1831, s. 15) asserts\r\nthat the mongrels from barbs and fantails are sterile: I have proved this\r\nto be erroneous, not only by crossing these hybrids with several other\r\nhybrids of the same parentage, but by the more severe test of pairing\r\nbrother and sister hybrids _inter se_, and they were _perfectly_ fertile.\r\nTemminck has stated ('Hist. Nat. Gén. des Pigeons,' tom. i. p. 197) that\r\nthe turbit or owl will not cross readily with other breeds: but my turbits\r\ncrossed, when left free, with almond tumblers and with trumpeters; the same\r\nthing has occurred (Rev. E. S. Dixon, 'The Dovecot,' p. 107) between\r\nturbits and dovecots and nuns. I have crossed turbits with barbs, as has M.\r\nBoitard (p. 34), who says the hybrids were very fertile. Hybrids from a\r\nturbit and fantail have been known to breed _inter se_ (Riedel,\r\nTaubenzucht, s. 25, and Bechstein, 'Naturgesch. Deutsch.' B. iv. s. 44).\r\nTurbits (Riedel, s. 26) have been crossed with pouters and with jacobins,\r\nand with a hybrid jacobin-trumpeter (Riedel, s. 27). The latter author has,\r\nhowever, made some vague statements (s. 22) on the sterility of turbits\r\nwhen crossed with certain other crossed breeds. But I have little doubt\r\nthat the Rev. E. S. Dixon's explanation of such statements is correct, viz.\r\nthat individual birds both with turbits and other breeds are occasionally\r\nsterile.\r\n\r\n[335] 'Das Ganze der Taubenzucht,' s. 18.\r\n\r\n[336] 'Les Pigeons,' &c., p. 35.\r\n\r\n[337] Domestic pigeons pair readily with the allied _C. oenas_ (Bechstein,\r\n'Naturgesch. Deutschlands,' B. iv. s. 3); and Mr. Brent has made the same\r\ncross several times in England, but the young were very apt to die at about\r\nten days old; one hybrid which he reared (from _C. oenas_ and a male\r\nAntwerp carrier) paired with a dragon, but never laid eggs. Bechstein\r\nfurther states (s. 26) that the domestic pigeon will cross with _C.\r\npalumbus_, _Turtur risoria_, and _T. vulgaris_, but nothing is said of the\r\nfertility of the hybrids, and this would have been mentioned had the fact\r\nbeen ascertained. In the Zoological Gardens (MS. report to me from Mr.\r\nJames Hunt) a male hybrid from _Turtur vulgaris_ and a domestic pigeon\r\n\"paired with several different species of pigeons and doves, but none of\r\nthe eggs were good.\" Hybrids from _C. oenas_ and _gymnophthalmos_ were\r\nsterile. In Loudon's 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' vol. vii. 1834, p. 154, it is\r\nsaid that a male hybrid (from _Turtur vulgaris_ male, and the\r\ncream-coloured _T. risoria_ female) paired during two years with a female\r\n_T. risoria_, and the latter laid many eggs, but all were sterile. MM.\r\nBoitard and Corbié ('Les Pigeons,' p. 235) state that the hybrids from\r\nthese two turtle-doves are invariably sterile both _inter se_ and with\r\neither pure parent. The experiment was tried by M. Corbié \"avec une espèce\r\nd'obstination;\" and likewise by M. Manduyt, and by M. Vieillot. Temminck\r\nalso found the hybrids from these two species quite barren. Therefore, when\r\nBechstein ('Naturgesch. Vogel. Deutschlands,' B. 4, s. 101) asserts that\r\nthe hybrids from these two turtle-doves propagate _inter se_ equally well\r\nwith pure species, and when a writer in the 'Field' newspaper (in a letter\r\ndated Nov. 10th, 1858) makes a similar assertion, it would appear that\r\nthere must be some mistake; though what the mistake is I know not, as\r\nBechstein at least must have known the white _variety_ of _T. risoria_: it\r\nwould be an unparalleled fact if the same two species sometimes produced\r\n_extremely_ fertile, and sometimes _extremely_ barren, offspring. In the\r\nMS. report from the Zoological Gardens it is said that hybrids from _Turtur\r\nvulgaris_ and _suratensis_, and from _T. vulgaris_ and _Ectopistes\r\nmigratorius_, were sterile. Two of the latter male hybrids paired with\r\ntheir pure parents, viz. _Turtur vulgaris_ and the Ectopistes, and likewise\r\nwith _T. risoria_ and with _Columba oenas_, and many eggs were produced,\r\nbut all were barren. At Paris, hybrids have been raised (Isid. Geoffrey\r\nSaint Hilaire, 'Hist. Nat. Générale,' tom. iii. p. 180) from _Turtur\r\nauritus_ with _T. cambayensis_ and with _T. suratensis_; but nothing is\r\nsaid of their fertility. At the Zoological Gardens of London the _Goura\r\ncoronata_ and _victoriæ_ produced a hybrid, which paired with the pure _G.\r\ncoronata_, and laid several eggs, but these proved barren. In 1860\r\n_Columba_ _gymnophthalmos_ and _maculosa_ produced hybrids in these same\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n[338] There is one exception to the rule, namely in a sub-variety of the\r\nswallow of German origin, which is figured by Neumeister, and was shown to\r\nme by Mr. Wicking. This bird is blue, but has not the black wing-bars; for\r\nour object, however, in tracing the descent of the chief races, this\r\nexception signifies the less as the swallow approaches closely in structure\r\nto _C. livia_. In many sub-varieties, the black bars are replaced by bars\r\nof various colours. The figures given by Neumeister are sufficient to show\r\nthat, if the wings alone are blue, the black wing-bars appear.\r\n\r\n[339] I have observed blue birds with all the above-mentioned marks in the\r\nfollowing races, which seemed to be perfectly pure, and were shown at\r\nvarious exhibitions. Pouters, with the double black wing-bars, with white\r\ncroup, dark bar to end of tail, and white edging to outer tail-feathers.\r\nTurbits, with all these same characters. Fantails, with the same; but the\r\ncroup in some was bluish or pure blue: Mr. Wicking bred blue fantails from\r\ntwo black birds. Carriers (including the Bagadotten of Neumeister), with\r\nall the marks: two birds which I examined had white, and two had blue\r\ncroups; the white edging to the outer tail-feathers was not present in all.\r\nMr. Corker, a great breeder, assures me that, if black carriers are matched\r\nfor many successive generations, the offspring become first ash-coloured,\r\nand then blue with black wing-bars. Runts of the elongated breed had the\r\nsame marks, but the croup was pale blue; the outer tail-feathers had white\r\nedges. Neumeister figures the great Florence Runt of a blue colour with\r\nblack bars. Jacobins are very rarely blue, but I have received authentic\r\naccounts of at least two instances of the blue variety with black bars\r\nhaving appeared in England: blue jacobins were bred by Mr. Brent from two\r\nblack birds. I have seen common tumblers, both Indian and English, and\r\nshort-faced tumblers, of a blue colour, with black wing-bars, with the\r\nblack bar at the end of the tail, and with the outer tail-feathers edged\r\nwith white; the croup in all was blue, or extremely pale blue, never\r\nabsolutely white. Blue barbs and trumpeters seem to be excessively rare;\r\nbut Neumeister, who may be implicitly trusted, figures blue varieties of\r\nboth, with black wing-bars. Mr. Brent informs me that he has seen a blue\r\nbarb; and Mr. H. Weir, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, once bred a\r\nsilver (which means very pale blue) barb from two yellow birds.\r\n\r\n[340] Mr. Blyth informs me that all the domestic races in India have the\r\ncroup blue; but this is not invariable, for I possess a very pale blue\r\nSimmali pigeon with the croup perfectly white, sent to me by Sir W. Elliot\r\nfrom Madras. A slaty-blue and chequered Nakshi pigeon has some white\r\nfeathers on the croup alone. In some other Indian pigeons there were a few\r\nwhite feathers confined to the croup, and I have noticed the same fact in a\r\ncarrier from Persia. The Java fantail (imported into Amoy, and thence sent\r\nme) has a perfectly white croup.\r\n\r\n[341] 'Les Pigeons,' &c., p. 37.\r\n\r\n[342] 'Treatise on Pigeons,' 1858, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[343] J. Moore's 'Columbarium,' 1735, in J. M. Eaton's edition, 1852, p.\r\n71.\r\n\r\n[344] I could give numerous examples; two will suffice. A mongrel, whose\r\nfour grandparents were a white turbit, white trumpeter, white fantail, and\r\nblue pouter, was white all over, except a very few feathers about the head\r\nand on the wings, but the whole tail and tail-coverts were dark\r\nbluish-grey. Another mongrel, whose four grandparents were a red runt,\r\nwhite trumpeter, white fantail, and the same blue pouter, was pure white\r\nall over, except the tail and upper tail-coverts, which were pale fawn, and\r\nexcept the faintest trace of double wing-bars of the same pale fawn tint.\r\n\r\n[345] It deserves notice, as bearing on the general subject of variation,\r\nthat not only _C. livia_ presents several wild forms, regarded by some\r\nnaturalists as species and by others as sub-species or as mere varieties,\r\nbut that the species of several allied genera are in the same predicament.\r\nThis is the case, as Mr. Blyth has remarked to me, with Treron, Palumbus,\r\nand Turtur.\r\n\r\n[346] 'Denkmaler,' Abth. ii.

Hist.,' vol. xx., 1847, p. 388.\r\n\r\n[386] 'Gardener's Chronicle,' 1851, p. 619.\r\n\r\n[387] I have consulted an eminent authority, Mr. Sclater, on this subject,\r\nand he thinks that I have not expressed myself too strongly. I am aware\r\nthat one ancient author, Acosta, speaks of fowls as having inhabited S.\r\nAmerica at the period of its discovery; and more recently, about 1795,\r\nOlivier de Serres speaks of wild fowls in the forests of Guiana; these were\r\nprobably feral birds. Dr. Daniell tells me, he believes that fowls have\r\nbecome wild on the west coast of Equatorial Africa; they may, however, not\r\nbe true fowls, but gallinaceous birds belonging to the genus Phasidus. The\r\nold voyager Barbut says that poultry are not natural to Guinea. Capt. W.\r\nAllen ('Narrative of Niger Expedition,' 1848, vol. ii. p. 42) describes\r\nwild fowls on Ilha dos Rollas, an island near St. Thomas's, on the west\r\ncoast of Africa: the natives informed him that they had escaped from a\r\nvessel wrecked there many years ago; they were extremely wild, and had \"a\r\ncry quite different to that of the domestic fowl,\" and their appearance was\r\nsomewhat changed. Hence it is not a little doubtful, notwithstanding the\r\nstatement of the natives, whether these birds really were fowls. That the\r\nfowl has become feral on several islands is certain. Mr. Fry, a very\r\ncapable judge, informed Mr. Layard, in a letter, that the fowls which have\r\nrun wild on Ascension \"had nearly all got back to their primitive colours,\r\nred and black cocks, and smoky-grey hens.\" But unfortunately we do not know\r\nthe colour of the poultry which were turned out. Fowls have become feral on\r\nthe Nicobar Islands (Blyth in the 'Indian Field,' 1858, p. 62), and in the\r\nLadrones (Anson's Voyage). Those found in the Pellew Islands (Crawfurd) are\r\nbelieved to be feral; and lastly, it is asserted that they have become\r\nferal in New Zealand, but whether this is correct I know not.\r\n\r\n[388] Mr. Hewitt, in 'The Poultry Book,' by W.

I am indebted to Mr. Orton for a letter on\r\nthe same subject.\r\n\r\n[391] Dixon, 'Ornamental and Domestic Poultry,' pp. 253, 324, 335. For game\r\nfowls, _see_ Ferguson on 'Prize Poultry,' p. 260.\r\n\r\n[392] 'Poultry Chronicle,' vol. ii. p. 71.\r\n\r\n[393] Dr. Pickering, in his 'Races of Man,' 1850, p. 374, says that the\r\nhead and neck of a fowl is carried in a Tribute-procession to Thoutmousis\r\nIII. (1445 B.C.); but Mr. Birch of the British Museum doubts whether the\r\nfigure can be identified as the head of a fowl. Some caution is necessary\r\nwith reference to the absence of figures of the fowl on the ancient\r\nEgyptian monuments, on account of the strong and widely prevalent prejudice\r\nagainst this bird. I am informed by the Rev. S. Erhardt that on the east\r\ncoast of Africa, from 4° to 6° south of the equator, most of the pagan\r\ntribes at the present day hold the fowl in aversion. The natives of the\r\nPellew Islands would not eat the fowl, nor will the Indians in some parts\r\nof S. America. For the ancient history of the fowl, see also Volz,\r\n'Beitrage zur Culturgeschichte,' 1852, s. 77; and Isid. Geoffroy St.\r\nHilaire, 'Hist. Nat. Gén.,' tom. iii. p. 61. Mr. Crawfurd has given an\r\nadmirable history of the fowl in his paper 'On the Relation of Domesticated\r\nAnimals to Civilisation,' read before the Brit. Assoc. at Oxford in 1860,\r\nand since printed separately. I quote from him on the Greek poet Theognis,\r\nand on the Harpy Tomb described by Sir C. Fellowes.

Brent and Tegetmeier.\r\n\r\n[431] It appears that I have not correctly designated the several groups of\r\nvertebræ, for a great authority, Mr. W. K. Parker ('Transact. Zoolog.\r\nSoc.,' vol. v. p. 198), specifies 16 cervical, 4 dorsal, 15 lumbar, and 6\r\ncaudal vertebræ in this genus. But I have used the same terms in all the\r\nfollowing descriptions.\r\n\r\n[432] Macgillivray, 'British Birds,' vol. i. p. 25.\r\n\r\n[433] It may be well to explain how the calculation has been made for the\r\nthird column. In _G. bankiva_ the leg-bones are to the wing-bones as 86 :\r\n54, or as (neglecting decimals) 100 : 62;--in Cochins as 311 : 162, or as\r\n100 : 52;--in Dorkings as 557 : 248, or as 100 : 44; and so on for the\r\nother breeds. We thus get the series of 62, 52, 44 for the relative-weights\r\nof the wing-bones in _G. bankiva_, Cochins, Dorkings, &c. And now taking\r\n100, instead of 62, for the weight of the wing-bones in _G. bankiva_, we\r\nget, by another rule of three, 83 as the weight of the wing-bones in\r\nCochins; 70 in the Dorkings; and so on for the remainder of the third\r\ncolumn in the table.\r\n\r\n[434] Mr. Blyth (in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.,' 2nd series, vol. i.,\r\n1848, p. 456) gives 3¼ lb. as the weight of a full-grown male _G. bankiva_;\r\nbut from what I have seen of the skins and skeletons of various breeds, I\r\ncannot believe that my two specimens of _G. bankiva_ could have weighed so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n[435] The third column is calculated on the same principle as explained in\r\nthe previous foot-note, p. 271.\r\n\r\n[436] 'Poultry Chronicle' (1854), vol. ii. p.91, and vol. i. p. 330.\r\n\r\n[437] Dr. Turral, in 'Bull.

A writer, it may be presumed\r\nDr. Lindley, remarks on the perfect series which may be formed between the\r\nalmond and the peach. Another high authority, Mr. Rivers, who has had such\r\nwide experience, strongly suspects ('Gardener's Chronicle,' 1863, p. 27)\r\nthat peaches, if left to a state of nature, would in the course of time\r\nretrograde into thick-fleshed almonds.\r\n\r\n[639] 'Journal of Hort. Soc.,' vol. ix. p. 168.\r\n\r\n[640] Whether this is the same variety as one lately mentioned ('Gard.\r\nChron.' 1865, p. 1154) by M. Carrière under the name of _Persica\r\nintermedia_, I know not: this var. is said to be intermediate in nearly all\r\nits characters between the almond and peach; it produces during successive\r\nyears very different kinds of fruit.\r\n\r\n[641] Quoted in 'Gard.

Chron.,'\r\n1862, p. 215) that the _P. malus_, with its nearly sessile fruit, ranges\r\nfarther south than the long-stalked P. _acerba_, which is entirely absent\r\nin Madeira, the Canaries, and apparently in Portugal. This fact supports\r\nthe belief that these two forms deserve to be called species. But the\r\ncharacters separating them are of slight importance, and of a kind known to\r\nvary in other cultivated fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n[698] _See_ 'Journ. of Hort.

He twice inserted grafts of the _Aria\r\nvestita_ on thorn-trees (_épines_) growing in pots; and the grafts, as they\r\ngrew, produced shoots with bark, buds, leaves, petioles, petals, and\r\nflower-stalks all widely different from those of the Aria. The grafted\r\nshoots were also much hardier, and flowered earlier, than those on the\r\nungrafted Aria.\r\n\r\n[897] 'Transact. Hort.

It is exactly intermediate in\r\nfoliage, time of flowering, dark striæ at the base of the standard petal,\r\nhairiness of the ovarium, and in almost every other character, between _C.\r\nlaburnum_ and _alpinus_; but it approaches the former species more nearly\r\nin colour, and exceeds it in the length of the racemes. We have before seen\r\nthat 20.3 per cent. of its pollen-grains are ill-formed and worthless. My\r\nplant, though growing not above thirty or forty yards from both\r\nparent-species, during some seasons yielded no good seeds; but in 1866 it\r\nwas unusually fertile, and its long racemes produced from one to\r\noccasionally even four pods. Many of the pods contained no good seeds, but\r\ngenerally they contained a single apparently good seed, sometimes two, and\r\nin one case three seeds. Some of the seeds germinated.\r\n\r\n[907] 'Annales de la Soc. de Hort. de Paris,' tom. vii., 1830, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[908] 'Annals and Mag. of Nat.

Soc. of London.\r\n\r\n[937] 'Philosophical Transactions,' vol. xlvii., 1751-52, p. 206.\r\n\r\n[938] Gallesio, 'Teoria della Riproduzione,' 1816, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[939] It may be worth while to call attention to the several means by which\r\nflowers and fruit become striped or mottled. Firstly, by the direct action\r\nof the pollen of another variety or species, as with the above-given cases\r\nof oranges and maize. Secondly, in crosses of the first generation, when\r\nthe colours of the two parents do not readily unite, as in the cases of\r\nMirabilis and Dianthus given a few pages back. Thirdly, in crossed plants\r\nof a subsequent generation, by reversion, through either bud or seminal\r\ngeneration. Fourthly, by reversion to a character not originally gained by\r\na cross, but which had long been lost, as with white-flowered varieties,\r\nwhich we shall hereafter see often become striped with some other colour.\r\nLastly, there are cases, as when peaches are produced with a half or\r\nquarter of the fruit like a nectarine, in which the change is apparently\r\ndue to mere variation, through either bud or seminal generation.\r\n\r\n[940] 'Transact.
