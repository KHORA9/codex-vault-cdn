To all who are interested in the earth, the study of\r\nrocks is an important branch of natural history. If detailed works\r\non petrology are to be consulted later, F. W. Clarke's _Data of\r\nGeochemistry_ (Bulletin, U.S. Geological Survey, ed. 2, 1911) must\r\non no account be overlooked. Its numerous references to published\r\npapers, and the attention given to rock-origins, make it a worthy\r\ncompanion to C. Doelter's _Petrogenesis_. Many things have perforce\r\nbeen omitted from the present essay. It seemed unnecessary to review\r\nthe Carbonaceous rocks, since the most important of these have been\r\nadmirably dealt with in E. A. N. Arber's _Natural History of Coal_,\r\npublished as a volume in this series. I should like to have described\r\noccurrences of rock-salt, of massive gypsum, and other products of\r\narid lands, where \"black alkali\" poisons the surface, and the casual\r\npools are fringed with white and crumbling crusts. Rock-taluses, and\r\nall the varied alluvium carried seaward as the outwash of continental\r\nland, well deserve a chapter to themselves. But there is really no end\r\nto the subject, which embraces all the accumulative processes of the\r\nearth. A few vacation-journeys, judiciously planned out, teach us that\r\ntext-books are merely signposts to set us on what is believed to be\r\nthe way. When the path enters the great forest, or rises above green\r\nlakelets to the crags, we find there those who went before us, pointing\r\nto unconquered lands.\r\n\r\n                                                            G.

The geographer or the general traveller may often wish\r\nfor closer acquaintance with the units that build up the scenery around\r\nhim. The characters of rocks again and again control the features of\r\nthe landscape. When studied more nearly, these same characters imply\r\nconditions of deposition or solidification, and lead the mind back to\r\nstill older landscapes, and to the meeting of oceans and continents on\r\nlong-forgotten shores. Petrology, indeed, involves the understanding\r\nof how rocks \"come to be where we find them when we try\"; but the\r\nclassification of hand-specimens was from the first easier than\r\nfield-investigation, and in later times the science was threatened\r\nwith the description of isolated microscopic slides. Fortunately, a\r\ncertain amount of feeling for natural history has been imported again\r\ninto the subject, and evolutionary principles and sequences have been\r\ndiscussed. Experimental work, moreover, has been brought to bear on the\r\nquestion of the origins of rocks, with more success than might have\r\nbeen expected, since it is very difficult to realise in a laboratory,\r\nor even in the mind, the conditions that prevail in the lower parts of\r\nthe earth's crust.\r\n\r\nRocks, we have to remember, are in themselves considerable masses, and\r\nhave relations with others far away. The coarseness of a sandstone at\r\none point, or even over square miles of country, implies the deposition\r\nof finer material somewhere else. The lava-flow implies the existence\r\nof mysterious cauldrons in the crust. It is, however, fortunate that\r\nthe primary classification of rocks was promulgated without regard for\r\ntheories of rock-origins. The work was done by men who were masters\r\nand pioneers in mineralogy. At a time when a powerful school regarded\r\nbasalt as of sedimentary origin, and when granite was generally\r\nbelieved to be the most ancient component of the crust, rock-masses\r\nwere taken in hand as aggregates of certain minerals, and were reduced\r\nto an orderly scheme for arrangement in the cabinets of the curious.\r\nAny system based on ideal relationships would have been fatal at that\r\ntime to petrology as a science.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Brongniart, in 1813, thus saw objections to the\r\nclassification of rocks that had been proposed by Werner. In his \"Essai\r\nd'une classification minéralogique des Roches mélangées,\" he showed the\r\nimpossibility of determining the age of a rock in relation to others\r\nbefore assigning to it a name, and the absurdity of separating similar\r\nrocks on account of differences in their geological age. Brongniart\r\nwas thus forced to rely, firstly, upon the prevalence of certain\r\nmineral constituents, and, secondly, on the structure of the mass. He\r\ndeveloped this scheme in 1827, in his \"Classification et caractères\r\nminéralogiques des Roches homogènes et hétérogènes\"; but it is clear\r\nthat, even in such a system, considerations of natural history and of\r\norigin will ultimately predominate. Brongniart was much influenced by\r\nKarl von Leonhard's \"Charakteristik der Felsarten,\" published in 1823,\r\nand these two authors have been regarded as the founders of petrography.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of distinguishing between rocks laid down as true\r\nsediments on the earth's surface and those that have consolidated from\r\na state of fusion has been very largely removed. The assistance of the\r\nmicroscope can now be called on to elucidate the minute structure of\r\nfine-grained masses, which appeared homogeneous to earlier workers.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer in microscopic methods was Pierre Louis Antoine Cordier,\r\nwho knew rocks as a traveller knows them in the field. In 1798, as\r\na young man of twenty-one, he had gone to Egypt with the famous\r\nexpedition under General Bonaparte. Déodat de Dolomieu had charge of\r\nthe geological observations, and Cordier went through the hardships of\r\nthe campaign as his assistant. When Bonaparte abandoned the army and\r\nwithdrew to Paris, Cordier might well have been lost to Europe.\r\n\r\nHowever, he successfully brought home the knowledge acquired in the\r\nfield, and set himself, in those agitating years, to solve the problem\r\nof the compact groundwork of igneous rocks. He argued that this\r\ngroundwork probably consisted of minerals, and that these minerals\r\nwere probably similar to those occurring as visible constituents of\r\nthe mass. He examined the powder of these larger crystals under the\r\nmicroscope, and made himself familiar with their aspect in a fractured\r\nform. He then powdered the compact material of his rocks, washed\r\naway the dust, and was able to recognise in the coarser residue the\r\nminerals that he had previously studied. He used the magnet to extract\r\nthe iron ore; he determined the fusibility of the particles with the\r\nblowpipe; and he even discovered in volcanic lavas a residual glass\r\nassociated with the crystalline material[1]. To this day, when a\r\nparticular mineral has to be determined in a rock, it is often best to\r\nfollow Cordier's method, and to extract the actual crystals, however\r\nsmall. Various modes of separation, especially those involving the use\r\nof dense liquids, have been devised since Cordier's time, and the\r\nspecific gravity of a single crystal can now be determined, although it\r\nmay be so small as to require looking for in the dense liquid with a\r\nlens[2].\r\n\r\nBetween 1836 and 1838, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, Professor of\r\nMedicine at Berlin, made an immense step forward in the study of rocks.\r\nBeing keenly interested in microscopic forms of life, he wished to\r\ndetermine their importance as constituents of rocks. Using a microscope\r\nmagnifying 300 diameters, he showed the presence of organisms in\r\nflint and limestone, and found in 1838 that a thin slice of chalk\r\ncoated over with Canada balsam became practically transparent. In\r\nhis \"Mikrogeologie,\" published in 1854, he gives drawings of thin\r\nsections of several flints, seen by transmitted light, which are thus\r\nrock-sections in the modern petrological sense. His method could not\r\nhave been generally known until his book appeared in 1854. Meanwhile,\r\nHenry Clifton Sorby, about 1845, found the naturalist W. C. Williamson\r\nmaking thin sections of fossil plants and bones. He promptly perceived\r\nthe importance of the method as applied to rocks in general, and\r\nintroduced it to the Geological Society of London in 1850, in a paper\r\non the Calcareous Grit of Scarborough. Seven years later, he read\r\nhis memorable paper on \"The Microscopical Structure of Crystals[3],\"\r\nin which he made use of slices of granite and of Vesuvian and other\r\nlavas. Ferdinand von Zirkel met Sorby by chance at Bonn in 1862, and,\r\nlearning his methods, proceeded to systematise the examination of\r\nrock-specimens with the microscope. Such studies, rapidly appreciated\r\nby Michel Lévy, Rosenbusch, Judd, and others, naturally led to advances\r\nof the first importance in petrology. They enabled workers to ascertain\r\nthe relations of the rock-constituents one to another, and the order\r\nof consolidation of minerals from an igneous magma. The broad division\r\nof rocks into those of sedimentary and those of igneous origin has\r\nbeen further emphasised. The rocks styled metamorphic still afford the\r\ngreatest difficulty, even after prolonged enquiry in the field.\r\n\r\nSeeing that some rocks are merely massive minerals, that is, large\r\nmasses formed of one mineral species, while others consist of crystals\r\nor fragments of a variety of minerals, it may be well to remind\r\nourselves of the distinction between minerals and rocks. We may define\r\na _mineral_ as a natural substance formed by inorganic action; its\r\nchemical composition is constant; under favourable circumstances, it\r\nassumes a characteristic crystalline form.\r\n\r\nLike all definitions of natural objects, the above requires some\r\nqualification. In many cases the chemical composition of a mineral\r\nvaries by a well-defined series of atomic replacements, and we\r\ncannot feel called upon to establish a new species for every step\r\naway from the rigid type. Sodium thus replaces potassium to some\r\nextent in orthoclase felspar. The crystalline form, again, may not be\r\nspecifically characteristic, as, for instance, in the members of the\r\ngarnet series, which crystallise in the cubic system. The homogeneity\r\nof molecular structure throughout the individual may be regarded as the\r\nmost essential feature of what we style a mineral species; that is to\r\nsay, the molecules contain the same elements in the same proportions,\r\nand are arranged on the same physical plan.\r\n\r\nA _rock_, on the other hand, is a mere aggregate of mineral particles,\r\nor of molecules that, under proper conditions, would group themselves\r\nto form mineral species. It may consist entirely of granules or\r\ncrystals of one species; but the structures in these have no common\r\norientation, as they would have in a single large continuous crystal.\r\nThe rock itself has no crystalline form, and any structures that\r\nsimulate such forms will be found on measurement to have none of the\r\nregularity that characterises genuine crystals. A rock, moreover,\r\nformed of several mineral species in association will by no means\r\npossess a constant chemical composition, and the variations from point\r\nto point form a feature of especial interest in the study of igneous\r\nmasses, of sediments deposited on a shore, or of alluvium in a valley\r\nstretching far between the hills.\r\n\r\nIn the pages that follow we hope, then, to bear in mind the relations\r\nof rocks to the earth and to ourselves. Like the ancient Romans, we\r\nbuild our cities with huge blocks and slabs brought from crystalline\r\nmasses oversea. We now tunnel, for our commercial highways, through the\r\ncomplex cores of mountain-chains. Everywhere rocks are our foundations,\r\nthroughout our travels or in our settled homes. They rise as obstacles\r\nagainst us, or they spread before us fields of fertile soil. Some\r\nknowledge of them is part of the general body of culture that makes us,\r\nin the best sense, citizens of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE COMMON MINERALS THAT FORM ROCKS\r\n\r\n    =Actinolite.= See Amphiboles.\r\n\r\n    =Albite.= See Felspars.\r\n\r\n    =Amphiboles.= A series of silicates with the general formula\r\n       RSiO_{3}, where R is magnesium, iron or calcium; in many,\r\n       such as the common species _Hornblende_, molecules occur in\r\n       addition in which aluminium and triad iron are introduced.\r\n       Hornblende thus consists of _m_ (Mg, Fe″, Ca) SiO_{3}.\r\n       _n_ (Mg, Fe″) (Al, Fe‴)_{2} SiO_{6}. _Actinolite_ is a\r\n       non-aluminous amphibole occurring in needle-like prisms. The\r\n       amphiboles crystallise in prisms having angles of about 56°\r\n       and 124°. See Pyroxenes.\r\n\r\n    =Anatase.= See Rutile.\r\n\r\n    =Andalusite.= Aluminium silicate, Al_{2}SiO_{5}, crystallising\r\n       in the rhombic system. _Sillimanite_ consists also of\r\n       Al_{2}SiO_{5} and is rhombic, but crystallises with different\r\n       fundamental angles.\r\n\r\n    =Anorthite.= See Felspars.\r\n\r\n    =Apatite.= Calcium phosphate, with fluorine, or sometimes\r\n       chlorine, (CaF)Ca_{4}(PO_{4})_{3} = 3Ca_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}.\r\n       CaF_{2}.\r\n\r\n    =Aragonite.= Calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}, crystallising in the\r\n       rhombic system, with a specific gravity of 2·93.

Dolomite (properly Dolomite-rock), in which\r\nhalf or nearly half the molecules consist of magnesium carbonate, is,\r\nhowever, generally included. The convenience of limestones as building\r\nmaterials has given them a world-wide interest. Their stratified and\r\njointed structure appealed to the early Egyptian architect, when he\r\nsought blocks for his pyramids. The ease with which limestones could\r\nbe carved, combined with a reasonable resistance to decay, gave them\r\na pre-eminence with the designers of our rich cathedrals. The Romans\r\nfound in the stained and altered varieties colour-schemes for basilicas\r\nand baths, and their luxurious taste in limestone has been inherited by\r\nthe modern builders of hotels.\r\n\r\nThe rock suffers, however, from its solubility in water containing even\r\na mild acid. In the gases dissolved by rain-water from the atmosphere,\r\ncarbon dioxide assumes a far larger proportion than that which it\r\npossesses in the air itself. The surface of limestone slabs becomes\r\nin consequence pitted and corroded by every rain that falls. The\r\nsulphuric acid in the air of modern coal-consuming cities is, however,\r\nstill more deadly in its action. J. A. Howe, in his recent work on\r\nbuilding stones, is of opinion that limestone is unsuitable for towns.\r\nLimestones may broadly be recognised by their solubility in cold dilute\r\nacids, with brisk evolution of carbon dioxide. Dolomitic varieties\r\nrequire hot acid.\r\n\r\nLimestones divide themselves into types produced by chemical\r\nprecipitation and those due to the accumulation of the hard parts of\r\norganisms; but in many of the latter types chemical precipitation\r\nalso plays a part. Organic action, moreover, frequently promotes the\r\ndeposition of the chemical types. _Detrital limestones_, that is,\r\nlimestones formed from the debris of older ones, are comparatively\r\nunimportant. They occur in certain zones of the Chalk and of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone in our islands, and record the breaking up in\r\nshallow water of beds that had already become consolidated. The Miocene\r\n_Nagelfluh_ conglomerates of the north side of the Swiss Alps are\r\noften formed of pebbles of the far older Mesozoic limestones. Similar\r\nconglomerates, cemented by calcium carbonate, are now being formed in\r\nthe river-beds of the limestone karstland of Hercegovina. Limestone,\r\nhowever, as a rule goes to pieces before the buffetings sustained by\r\nmixed rocks on a shore. Even if it survives for a time in gravels,\r\npercolating waters ultimately dissolve it, and only a porous skeleton,\r\nformed of its impurities, remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMESTONES DEPOSITED FROM SOLUTION\r\n\r\nThough calcium carbonate is far less soluble than calcium sulphate,\r\nlarge quantities are carried invisibly, owing to the presence of carbon\r\ndioxide, in river waters, and thus accumulate in inland seas that\r\nhave no outlet except by evaporation. Here _Calcareous Tufa_ may be\r\ndeposited as a crust upon the shores and on the growing islets, as the\r\nwater shrinks away, and before the more soluble gypsum and rock-salt\r\ncan separate out. Hot springs of volcanic origin, like the Sprudel of\r\nKarlsbad in Bohemia, may deposit calcium carbonate as the water cools\r\nand is relieved from pressure. At Karlsbad, little grains of granite,\r\nor of the minerals of granite, serve as centres, and encrusting layers\r\nare formed round them, until pea-like bodies are produced. These become\r\ncemented together, giving rise to the well-known freshwater _pisolitic\r\nlimestone_ or _roestone_.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of the Great Salt Lake of Utah, calcareous tufa occurs\r\nalso in the form of grains resembling little eggs. These are the\r\noolitic grains that were first known as constituents of fossil\r\nlimestones. The calcium carbonate of oolitic grains at Karlsbad, from\r\nthe Great Salt Lake, and from the sea, is deposited in a form that\r\ngives the reaction of aragonite when boiled in cobalt nitrate. A.\r\nLacroix, however, finds that the material at Karlsbad has a specific\r\ngravity lower even than that of calcite, and that its double refraction\r\nis also distinctly weaker. He has called this form of calcium carbonate\r\n\"ktypeite.\"\r\n\r\n_Travertine_ is a tufa laid down on twigs and other vegetation, where\r\nsprings emerge laden with calcium carbonate. In a massive form, it\r\nbuilds tufa-basins, as in the Mammoth Hot Springs of the Yellowstone\r\nPark. Both here and at Karlsbad, it appears that vegetation of humble\r\ntype, multiplying under warm conditions, materially assists the deposit\r\nby withdrawing carbon dioxide from the water. The unstable calcium\r\nbicarbonate is thus converted into the carbonate, which is thrown down\r\nas a quickly increasing crust.\r\n\r\nAmong the limestone regions of the Dinaric Alps, calcareous tufas or\r\ntravertines, laid down by ordinary streams, form massive beds that tend\r\nto choke the hollows of the hills. The basin of Jajce in Bosnia is thus\r\npartially filled up, and the town is built on materials brought in\r\nsolution from the mountains. The modern waters are still adding to this\r\ndeposit, and Fr. Katzer[4] has pointed out that the falls of the Pliva\r\nare prevented from cutting their way down to the level of the Vrbas\r\nravine, into which they plunge, by the mass of tufa which they build up\r\nin their own course.\r\n\r\nAnother type of limestone deposited from solution is of considerable\r\ninterest in arid lands, or lands with only a seasonal rainfall. Where\r\nevaporation goes on steadily at the surface, while water is brought up\r\nby capillary action from below, calcium carbonate may form a cement\r\nto the soil, or to the crumbling rock near the surface, and a solid\r\ncalc-tufa may arise by continued transference of matter in solution\r\nfrom lower levels. In the Cape of Good Hope such formations are\r\nconspicuous[5].\r\n\r\nIn a careful series of experiments, G. Linck[6] showed in 1903 that\r\nsea-water at 17° C. can only hold ·0191 per cent. of calcium carbonate\r\nin solution. Though this quantity is not realised in the open ocean,\r\nyet near shores rivers may bring down an excess. The Thames, though\r\nflowing for a long distance over a limestone area, contains only ·0116\r\nper cent. of calcium carbonate; but springs traversing limestone often\r\ncarry ·03 per cent., or ten times as much as that found in ordinary\r\nseas. Hence a precipitation of calcium carbonate from the bicarbonate\r\nstate may take place not far from land. The mineral deposited is\r\ncalcite in temperate climates and aragonite under warm tropical\r\nconditions. That such a precipitation actually occurs is proved by the\r\nmassive grey limestones, containing modern shells, which have been\r\nrecorded for our islands from the sea-floor off the Isle of Man and\r\noff the coast of Mayo. In the case of the Irish Channel, the excess of\r\ncalcium carbonate may be supplied by springs rising through the glacial\r\ngravels, which contain abundant pebbles of limestone.\r\n\r\nAmmonium carbonate, again, derived from the decay of organisms, or\r\nsodium carbonate, will precipitate calcium carbonate as aragonite\r\nfrom the calcium sulphate and chloride, but not from the calcium\r\nbicarbonate, of salt water. Films of aragonite are at present\r\naccumulating by this process on the floor of the Black Sea, and marine\r\noolitic grains, also consisting of aragonite, are produced by the same\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nIn the case of oolitic grains, deposition is no doubt helped by\r\nevaporation, since they seem to arise in shallow waters. The _Oolitic\r\nLimestones_ that have proved so admirable as building stones, whether\r\nfrom the quarries of Caen or Portland, are cemented representatives of\r\nthe loose deposits formed in modern tropical seas. De la Beche long\r\nago compared their grains with those from West Indian coral-reefs.\r\nThese small egg-like bodies develop round fragments of foraminiferal\r\nand other shells, round the ossicles of echinoderms, and round broken\r\nbits of coral. At first they have the general form of the nucleus; but,\r\nas they are rolled by the waves during their growth, they become more\r\nand more spheroidal as they enlarge. Boring algæ make tubular passages\r\nin them, and these have led to the view that algæ of thread-like form\r\nactually originate oolitic structure. Doelter, Linck, and others\r\nconclude, with much reason, that the mode of deposition is inorganic.\r\nWhen the grains are unusually large, they are often flattened and\r\nirregular, as in the marine _Pisolites_ or _Pea-grits_.\r\n\r\nFor building purposes, the fine-grained oolites without large fossils\r\nare much sought after, since they can be trimmed equally in any desired\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the question of the inorganic deposition of limestone,\r\nwe may note that R. A. Daly[7] has suggested that the pre-Cambrian\r\nand early Cambrian limestones were entirely products of chemical\r\nprecipitation. He believes that the continental areas were at first\r\nrelatively small, and that the abundance of decaying soft-bodied\r\norganisms on the sea-floor led to a continuous precipitation of such\r\ncalcium carbonate as was available. Hence the ocean was limeless,\r\nand it was only when continental land became more extended that\r\na sufficient quantity of lime salts was brought in by rivers to\r\ncounterbalance that thrown down by ammonium carbonate and sodium\r\ncarbonate on the sea-floor. Daly urges that, on this account, the\r\nearlier organisms could not form calcareous shells or skeletons, and\r\nhe also believes that pre-Cambrian and Cambrian limestones, even\r\nwhen unaltered, show no signs of having originated from fragmental\r\norganic remains. Linck's researches (p. 17) show that limestones thus\r\nprecipitated must have originally consisted of aragonite.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMESTONES FORMED OF ORGANIC REMAINS\r\n\r\nThese limestones present an immense variety, according to the nature\r\nof the originating organisms, and the amount of foreign material\r\nbrought down into the water where they accumulated. The calcareous\r\nremains of Chara may form a white deposit on the floors of freshwater\r\nlakes. The part played by calcareous algæ in the formation of marine\r\nlimestones has long been recognised; but the detailed exploration in\r\n1904 of the atoll of Funafuti in the Pacific showed that Halimeda may\r\nbe responsible for a considerable portion of an ordinary \"coral-reef.\"\r\nLithothamnium occurs in immense quantities, associated with molluscan\r\nremains, near many shores, and forms a large part of the material of\r\nthe raised beaches in Spitsbergen.\r\n\r\nAnimal, not vegetable, activity, however, is responsible for the\r\nmajority of our limestones, and the humbler organisms, by reason of\r\ntheir abundance, play a prominent part in rock-formation. Analogies\r\nbetween the Globigerina-ooze of deep waters and the groundwork of the\r\nsoft white limestone known as _Chalk_ have been freely pointed out.\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century, Ehrenberg, in a series of researches\r\nwith the microscope, proved the organic origin of the compact ground\r\nof marine limestones. The occurrence of foraminifera from the shore\r\noutwards to truly oceanic waters provides a fine-grained calcareous\r\nmaterial which forms deposits at very various depths. The milioline\r\ntypes, often with a surface like that of glazed porcelain, are common\r\nin the sandy beds formed near a coast. Few rocks are more fascinating\r\nunder the microscope than those in which such types are seen in\r\nsection, associated with detrital grains of quartz, washed down from\r\nthe land, and perhaps with bright green grains of the marine mineral,\r\nglauconite. In Ireland white chalks occur, speckled throughout with\r\nglauconite, which looks dark in the rock-mass, but which reveals its\r\ngreen tint when streaked out by the hammer. When formed still farther\r\nfrom land, pure chalk arises from the consolidation of foraminiferal\r\nooze, and the probable depth in which it accumulated must be judged\r\nfrom the nature of the associated organisms. A white limestone may,\r\nhowever, arise in a comparatively shallow sea, where the rivers\r\nbring down little solid matter from the land. A coast formed of pure\r\nlimestone, with clear streams flowing from a land of similar rock\r\nbehind, may allow of the development of pure limestone on its shores.\r\nIt is generally agreed that the Upper Chalk of the British Isles and\r\nof northern France was laid down in water one thousand fathoms or more\r\nin depth; yet the corresponding white limestone of northern Ireland in\r\nplaces follows rapidly on conglomeratic and glauconitic deposits, and\r\nseems to owe its purity to the comparative absence of rain and rivers\r\non the highland of crystalline rocks which stretched westward from its\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThere are two epochs of the earth's history in which foraminifera were\r\nremarkable for their size as well as their abundance. The first gave\r\nus the grey Fusulina limestone of Upper Carboniferous times, when this\r\nspindle-shaped shell spread freely from the United States through the\r\narctic regions to the east of Asia. The second gave us, in the Eocene\r\nperiod, the great beds formed of Nummulites and Orbitoides, which\r\nwe meet with in Europe on the Lake of Thun, but which are far more\r\nimportant in Lower Egypt. The disc-like forms of the nummulites in the\r\nwhite limestone of the Pyramids are familiar to hundreds of travellers,\r\nand forms are recorded up to four and a half inches across.\r\n\r\nThe foraminiferal origin of many compact limestones can often be\r\nappreciated on smooth surfaces with a pocket-lens. The older examples\r\nhave commonly become stained and darkened, and crystallisation of\r\ncalcite throughout the ground has in part destroyed the original\r\norganic structures. This tendency to crystallise affects even the\r\nlarger fossils, and brachiopods and molluscs have sometimes disappeared\r\nfrom our Carboniferous limestones, without the intervention of\r\n\"metamorphic\" heat or pressure. In most limestones older than the\r\nEocene period, the shells and other fossils, such as corals, that\r\nwere originally formed of aragonite have passed into the calcite\r\nstate, without the destruction of their characteristic shapes. Shells,\r\nhowever, have been found still preserved as aragonite in beds as old as\r\nthe Jurassic period[8].\r\n\r\nThe lamellibranchs, the ordinary bivalves, came into prominence as\r\nlimestone-builders with the Carboniferous period, and are now rivalled\r\nby the univalve gastropods, which displayed no widespread activity\r\nuntil Eocene times. The most massive existing shell, however, is a\r\nlamellibranch, the giant Tridacna of Australian seas, a single valve\r\nof which may weigh 250 lbs. The cephalopods, though lying far nearer to\r\nthe crown of molluscan development, became important from the Silurian\r\nOrthoceras onwards, and nautiloids of various forms are common fossils\r\nin the Carboniferous limestone. Their large size attracts attention\r\nfrom our present point of view. The cephalopods, however, swell the\r\nbulk of many limestones, not by the thickness of their shells, but\r\nthrough their chambered character, which has prevented complete\r\ninfilling of the shell, and which thus allows of cavities in the mass.\r\n\r\nThis is notably the case with the ammonites, which contribute so\r\nlargely to Jurassic limestones. Crystalline calcite has often been\r\ndeposited by infiltration on the septa and on the inner layer of the\r\nshell, thus reducing the hollow spaces. The massive calcite guards of\r\nthe belemnites form a considerable part of many limestones.\r\n\r\nEven freshwater lakes possess molluscan deposits, producing a white\r\nlimestone of their own. Where streams flow over pure pre-existing\r\nlimestone, there is no alluvial mud to choke the basins. In the hard\r\nlake-waters, gastropods such as Limnæa and Planorbis, and a few\r\nbivalves, can then flourish freely, and a \"shell-marl\" accumulates\r\nat the bottom, unmixed with sediment. Limestone of this type is\r\nconspicuous in hollows in the Dinaric Alps, which were once occupied\r\nby lakes, and is often found beneath peat in the limestone lowland of\r\ncentral Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn older days, two groups of organisms, now relatively unimportant,\r\nhad a powerful place. The brachiopods, including in early Palæozoic\r\ntimes an interesting series of thin shells largely composed of calcium\r\nphosphate, were for long the predominant shell-bearing organisms. The\r\nstout Spiriferidæ and the well-known _Productus giganteus_ of the\r\nCarboniferous period illustrate their dominance. The group became much\r\nrestricted in variety in Jurassic times; but even then Terebratula and\r\nRhynchonella occurred so abundantly that they now fall out of many\r\nrock-faces like pebbles from a loose conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe sea-lilies have similarly lost their place as limestone-builders,\r\nthough their \"ossicles,\" notably from their stems, furnish crinoidal\r\nor \"encrinital\" masses from Silurian to Carboniferous times. The\r\nbroken portions of their stems, resembling tubes of tobacco-pipes, are\r\nconspicuous when they are weathered out on rock-surfaces or revealed in\r\npolished slabs of marble. The fact that each joint or ossicle, as is\r\nthe universal case in the echinodermata, consists of a single crystal\r\nof calcite causes the fragments to break with the characteristic\r\ncleavage of that mineral. The smooth glancing surfaces thus seen on\r\nfractured specimens readily call attention to them in a rock.\r\n\r\nThose humble colonial organisms, the compound corals, have so special\r\na place as limestone-formers that they have been reserved for more\r\ndetailed treatment. The accumulation of their skeletons, and the fact\r\nthat they may form large continuous masses by their very mode of\r\ngrowth, promotes the formation of solid rock at an unusual rate. Von\r\nRichthofen long ago pointed out how foraminifera and other drifted\r\nmaterial became caught in the interstices of coral, producing even a\r\nstratified structure in the hollows of a reef; and subsequent research\r\nhas shown the composite character of reefs in various portions of the\r\ntropic seas. Calcareous algæ as already remarked, and the massive and\r\noften encrusting skeletons of hydrozoa, such as Millepora, are freely\r\nassociated with the products of true corals.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin, in his famous theory of the formation of atolls and\r\nbarrier-reefs, showed how, in a subsiding area, corals might keep pace\r\nwith the downward movement. Hence reefs might arise of great vertical\r\nthickness, although the polypes themselves could flourish only in the\r\nupper twenty fathoms or so of water. This conclusion, which appears\r\nstrictly logical, has met with much opposition from Karl Semper,\r\nAlexander Agassiz, and Sir John Murray. Murray in particular urges the\r\nimportance of banks of calcareous organisms in building up platforms\r\non which corals may ultimately dwell. The extension of reefs outward\r\ninto deep water has been attributed to the rolling down of wave-worn\r\ncoral debris over submarine mountain-slopes. From this point of view,\r\nan apparently thick atoll may be formed as a comparatively thin mass\r\nof limestone at the summit of a volcanic cone that fails to reach the\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the view that thick coral-limestones are formed at the\r\npresent day in the Pacific have been unwilling to accept the results\r\neven of the deep boring in the atoll of Funafuti[9], which penetrated\r\nmaterials like those of the superficial layers of the reef to a depth\r\nof 1114 feet. They have also refused to see in the huge dolomitic\r\nrocks of Tyrol the remains of Triassic reefs four thousand feet in\r\nthickness. None the less, most geologists regard the Funafuti boring\r\nas a strong support for Darwin's contention. Whatever may be proved as\r\nto the origin of this or that atoll at the present day, it is clear\r\nthat the possibility of subsidence leads us to expect considerable\r\ncoral-limestones among our ancient rocks. The same problem arises\r\nwherever we have a rich molluscan fauna continuously represented in two\r\nor three thousand feet of limestone, or where we find shore-deposits\r\nof any kind accumulated to an unusual thickness. Darwin, at the end of\r\nthe fifth chapter of his work on \"The structure and distribution of\r\nCoral-Reefs,\" gives a vivid account of the features that would appear\r\nin a section of an atoll that has grown large through subsidence of\r\nits inorganic floor, and he emphasises the occurrence of conglomerates\r\nof broken coral-rock on the outer zone. The stratification of material\r\nby wave-action in this zone, and the horizontal deposition of finer\r\nmaterial in the lagoon, would give to the dissected mass a general\r\nsedimentary aspect. Darwin concluded that the ring of solid coral,\r\nthe true reef, might be denuded away during an epoch of elevation,\r\nand that only stratified portions might remain. He does not seem to\r\nhave discussed the contemporaneous deposition of pelagic material from\r\nforaminiferal and other sources against the outer surface of the reef\r\nwhereby an interlocking of two facies of limestone might arise.\r\n\r\nThese features, together with those predicted by Darwin, have been\r\nrecognised by von Richthofen and Mojsisovics in the Tyrol dolomites,\r\nand have afforded Austrian geologists good evidence that large parts\r\nof these limestones originated as coral-reefs. Faulting, however, has\r\nundoubtedly taken place in this region, producing here and there a\r\nsubsidence of the limestone blocks among the surrounding more normal\r\nsediments. Rothpletz, Ogilvie Gordon[10], and other critics of von\r\nRichthofen's view have seen in this faulting the cause of the abrupt\r\nchange from a facies of massive dolomite to one of normal sedimentation\r\non the same horizontal level. They have also urged that shell-banks\r\nmay accumulate locally so as to simulate reefs by their contrast with\r\ntheir surroundings, while the change to dolomite has obliterated their\r\noriginal features (see p. 30). It cannot be denied, however, that\r\ncoral-reefs and their associated detrital deposits must exercise a very\r\nimportant influence in the formation of solid limestone.\r\n\r\nEven small knots and local groups of compound corals are seen in\r\nordinary limestones to serve as a mesh in which other organic remains\r\nhave become entrapped. The ease with which the aragonite of their\r\nskeletons becomes silicified causes them often to stand out on\r\nweathered surfaces with all the delicacy of structure displayed upon a\r\nmodern reef.\r\n\r\nWhere limestones and shales are associated together, a \"knoll\r\nstructure\" may be found, the limestone occurring in masses of a\r\nsomewhat hemispherical form, with the shales fitted against and round\r\nthem. In some cases this may be due to the local distribution of\r\npatches of growing coral on the old sea-floor; but in other cases\r\nthe structure has arisen from compression and brecciation of the\r\nstrata, the original beds of limestone becoming broken up and the\r\nmore yielding beds flowing round them. This structure is well seen\r\non a small scale in many \"crush-conglomerates,\" where the limestone\r\nappears as knots and eyes, resembling pebbles. Yet near at hand the\r\ntrue bedding may be traced, bands of limestone alternating with shale,\r\nand a few cross-joints indicating the possibility of a separation\r\nof the limestone into blocks. These blocks become rounded in the\r\ngeneral rock-flow; but Gardiner and Reynolds[11] suggest solution by\r\ninfiltering water as an explanation of certain remarkable examples\r\nstudied by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERED FORMS OF MASSIVE LIMESTONE\r\n\r\nA certain amount of magnesium carbonate is present in the skeletons\r\nof some marine organisms. This has been shown both by Forchammer and\r\nWalther[911]. A foraminifer, _Nubecularia novorossica_, has been found\r\nwith 26 per cent. of magnesium carbonate, and a serpula with 7·64\r\nper cent.; alcyonarian corals contain up to 9·32 per cent., while\r\ncalcareous algæ, such as Lithothamnium and Halimeda, contain about 12\r\nper cent.[12]. The magnesium salt is not, however, here combined with\r\ncalcium carbonate to form the mineral dolomite; none the less it is\r\nclear that such organisms introduce magnesium in appreciable quantities\r\ninto the constitution of marine limestones.\r\n\r\nMarine limestones are very commonly \"dolomitised.\" Dolomite, the joint\r\ncarbonate, CaMg(CO_{3})_{2}, contains 54·35 per cent. of calcium\r\ncarbonate and 45·65 per cent. of magnesium carbonate, or carbon dioxide\r\n47·8, lime 30·4, and magnesia 21·8. Its specific gravity is 2·85.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of dolomite in intimate association with calcite has\r\nbeen proved by E. W. Skeats[13] in the case of modern coral-reefs,\r\nand the secondary deposition of the mineral has been made clear. The\r\nskeletons of the corals themselves may now consist of dolomite, while\r\ncalcite has crystallised in their interstices, or remains as part of\r\nthe original infilling of mud. The presence of dolomite in reefs has,\r\nof course, long been known, having been observed by J. D. Dana in 1849,\r\nand it has been realised that, by prolonged alteration, masses of\r\n_Dolomite Rock_ become built up[14].\r\n\r\nCommonly, the process produces a _Dolomitic Limestone_, in which\r\ncalcium carbonate is still in excess of the 54 per cent. which is\r\npresent in the mineral dolomite.\r\n\r\nThe alteration of the original limestone is, however, sufficiently\r\nprofound. The ready crystallisation of dolomite as rhombohedra destroys\r\nthe organic structure, and traces of corals or molluscan shells\r\ndisappear from great thicknesses of rock. It is uncertain whether the\r\nprocess of dolomitisation proceeds most rapidly in the evaporating\r\nwaters of the lagoons, or, as Pfaff believes, at considerable depths,\r\nwhere the pressure may reach 100 atmospheres. Magnesium carbonate, as\r\nwe shall note later, may be removed from dolomite in solution under\r\npressure at a greater rate than calcium carbonate. If this occurs in\r\nsea-water, it would seem to militate against the production of dolomite\r\nin the lower levels of a reef.\r\n\r\nThe magnesium required for dolomitisation is derived from the magnesium\r\nsulphate and chloride of sea-water, calcium being removed during the\r\nchange. C. Klement in particular urges that a concentrated solution of\r\nsodium chloride at 60° C. assists the process in the case of magnesium\r\nsulphate. Aragonite, the material of coral skeletons and of most\r\nmolluscan shells, is more susceptible than calcite. The temperature of\r\nKlement's experiments may be realised in lagoons or between tide-marks,\r\nand Doelter suggests that the element of time in nature may allow the\r\nreaction to take place at lower temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe intimate structure of modern dolomitic limestone, as exhibited\r\nin coral-reefs, satisfies us that many older or fossil dolomites\r\nwere formed from marine calcareous deposits while these were still\r\naccumulating. In other cases we must admit that the dolomite has\r\ndeveloped in the neighbourhood of joints after the consolidation of the\r\nrock. The view that dolomitisation results from the mere removal of\r\ncalcium, the magnesium originally present in organic skeletons becoming\r\nthus more concentrated, is not borne out by recent observations.\r\n\r\nSkeats[15] has carefully compared the dolomite-rocks of Tyrol with the\r\nmaterials of recent coral-reefs. In both there is a striking absence\r\nof detritus of inorganic origin, and his work goes far to show that\r\nthe much-discussed Alpine dolomites were formed under conditions which\r\noccur in the neighbourhood of existing reefs. This, however, does not\r\nsolve the question as to whether we are dealing in Tyrol with fossil\r\ncoral-reefs, or with the calcareous type of ordinary marine sediments,\r\nwhich might undergo the same kind of alteration. While Skeats finds in\r\ntwo dolomites from recent reefs 43 per cent. of magnesium carbonate,\r\nthe substitution seems usually to terminate when 40 per cent. has been\r\nintroduced. In Tyrol, however, the process has gone so far as to give\r\nrise to true dolomites, with 45·65 of magnesium carbonate.\r\n\r\nThe dolomites of the Jurassic series in north Bavaria are massive rocks\r\nalmost devoid of fossils, traversed by shrinkage cracks, and associated\r\nwith richly fossiliferous stratified limestones. The relations of these\r\ntwo types of rock are those of coral-reefs to the bedded deposits on\r\ntheir flanks, and the dolomite seems to merge horizontally into the\r\nstratified series. As in Tyrol, fossils and corals are rare in the\r\nbosses of dolomite, but the structural evidence is strongly in favour\r\nof their having originated as steeply sided reefs.\r\n\r\nThe dolomitic facies of the Carboniferous limestone in our islands\r\nis an example of the second type of origin. The dolomite here\r\nfrequently occurs in irregular veins and patches. The introduction\r\nof iron carbonate with the magnesium salt stains the dolomite brown\r\non exposure to oxidation, and its limits are thus clearly seen in the\r\ngeneral blue-grey mass. The dolomitisation has evidently proceeded\r\nfrom joint-surfaces inwards. It is often sufficiently thorough to\r\nobliterate all traces of fossils, and the shrinkage accompanying the\r\nchemical change has produced numerous cavities, in which calcite has\r\nsubsequently crystallised. An expansion takes place when aragonite is\r\naltered into dolomite, unless more of the calcium carbonate is removed\r\nthan is necessary to give place to the magnesium carbonate introduced.\r\nIn the change from calcite, with a density of 2·72, to dolomite, with\r\na density of 2·85, there is, on the other hand, a shrinkage of 4·56\r\nper cent. Where the alteration, then, takes place while the aragonite\r\norganisms still remain as aragonite, and not as calcite, an expansion\r\nrather than a contraction should occur in the substance of a reef; but\r\nwhen an old limestone, in which all the calcium carbonate is present as\r\ncalcite, becomes dolomitised, a considerable shrinkage will occur, and\r\nrifts and hollows may remain obvious.\r\n\r\nVery few dolomites, except those found in association with rock-salt\r\nand other products of the evaporation of lagoons, can now be attributed\r\nto direct chemical deposition from the sea.\r\n\r\nDaly[7] has argued that the first Palæozoic and the pre-Cambrian\r\ndolomites were formed by precipitation, since the calcium salts in\r\nthose early days were completely removed from the sea-water. Ammonium\r\ncarbonate, though effective in precipitating the calcium salts, does\r\nnot act on those of magnesium until the calcium salts have been brought\r\ndown. But, under the conditions postulated for the river-waters that\r\nreached the sea from the earliest continental lands, conditions\r\ninvolving the presence of only small quantities of salts of calcium,\r\nthe decay of organisms on the sea-floor might lead to a deposition of\r\nall the magnesium salts, following on those of calcium, both coming\r\ndown in the form of carbonates.\r\n\r\nThe experimental work of Pfaff[16] should be considered in connexion\r\nwith Daly's suggestions, since means are there indicated whereby basic\r\nmagnesium carbonate, precipitated from sea-water, may associate itself\r\nwith calcium carbonate to form dolomite; shallow-water conditions, with\r\nconcentration by evaporation, are required.\r\n\r\nDaly compares analyses of river-waters now running over pre-Cambrian\r\nrocks with analyses of pre-Cambrian limestones, and the ratio of the\r\ncarbonates of magnesium and calcium is shown to be the same in both\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have said, it now seems probable that the great majority\r\nof dolomitic limestones owe their magnesium to substitution from\r\nwithout. Direct precipitation of dolomite has, however, been invoked\r\nto account for several cases of Permian age, such as the Magnesian\r\nLimestone of the county of Durham. Near Sunderland, this rock is\r\ngreatly modified, containing ball-like and other concretions,\r\nassociated with frequent cavities. Traces of the original bedding\r\nremain, running through the concretions, and marine fossils are\r\nabundant. Conybeare and Phillips, so far back as 1822, stated that the\r\nnodules were devoid of magnesia, though formed in a magnesian rock. In\r\nspite of this, these objects long appeared as dolomite in collections.\r\nE. J. Garwood[17] showed conclusively that they resulted from the\r\nconcentration of calcium carbonate in a concretionary form. The process\r\nwhereby a dolomite may thus revert towards the ordinary limestone\r\ncondition, with removal of magnesium in most cases, has been styled\r\n\"dedolomitisation.\" Water containing calcium sulphate after passing\r\nthrough a dolomite is found to carry magnesium sulphate by a chemical\r\nexchange. Skeats[18], moreover, points out that, under a pressure of\r\nfive atmospheres the magnesium carbonate of dolomite becomes more\r\nsoluble than the calcium carbonate in fresh water containing carbon\r\ndioxide. The ordinary relations are thus reversed under pressure, and a\r\ncause of dedolomitisation may be indicated.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of contact-action from igneous rocks, dolomite may\r\nseparate into calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, and carbon dioxide.\r\nThe magnesium oxide takes up water and yields the flaky colourless\r\nmineral brucite. Where silica is present, either as an impurity in the\r\ndolomite, or introduced from an invading siliceous magma, magnesium\r\nand calcium silicates may be built up[19]. Olivine thus arises, and,\r\non becoming hydrated and passing into serpentine, stains the rock\r\nin various shades of green. The calcium carbonate crystallises as a\r\nground of granular calcite, and the whole mass becomes a handsome\r\n_Ophicalcite_, or serpentinous marble. The famous rock of Connemara,\r\nused in polished slabs, has arisen through contact with intrusive\r\ndiorite.\r\n\r\nDolomitic limestones are liable to decay rapidly in towns, owing to\r\nthe formation of magnesium sulphate, which, as shown above, is even\r\nmore soluble in water than is the accompanying calcium sulphate. In the\r\ncountry, the crystals of dolomite resist ordinary weathering by the\r\ncarbon dioxide of the rain-water better than those of calcite; and the\r\nrock thus becomes loosened through the loss of one constituent, and\r\ncrumbles into a dolomite sand[20]. Compact dolomites, however, have\r\nfurnished some excellent building-stones for country use, since here\r\nthe more resisting mineral forms the bulk of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe _Phosphatic Limestones_ are commercially even more important.\r\nTricalcium orthophosphate, derived, perhaps, in the first instance\r\nfrom the decay of bones of fishes and the excreta known as coprolites,\r\ntends to become aggregated in certain limestones, as in the chalk\r\nof Mons in Belgium and of Taplow in Buckinghamshire. The phosphate\r\nreplaces foraminiferal and other shells, and frequently forms\r\ninternal casts of fossils. In the latter case, it has replaced the\r\ncalcareous mud that first occupied the shells. The observations of the\r\n\"Challenger\" expedition show that concretionary calcium phosphate is\r\nforming among the calcareous and glauconitic oozes of existing oceans,\r\nnodular masses collecting, in which foraminiferal shells are united and\r\neven replaced by calcium phosphate. Where deposits of guano are formed\r\nby sea-birds on surfaces of coral limestone, as at Christmas Island\r\nto the south of Java and at Sombrero in the Windward Islands, calcium\r\nphosphate becomes washed downwards and replaces part of the calcium\r\ncarbonate of the rock. The resulting phosphatic limestone is quarried\r\non a commercial scale, and the very existence of Christmas Island is\r\nsaid to be threatened by the energy of excavators. The \"phosphorites\r\ndu Quercy,\" well known to agriculturists in France, are accumulations\r\nin hollows and fissures of Jurassic limestone, and are associated with\r\nthe bones of fossil mammals. But in this and in other cases there is\r\nmuch doubt as to whether the phosphate is derived from the bones, or\r\nis locally concentrated, with other impurities, such as sand and clay,\r\nthrough solution of the adjacent limestone.\r\n\r\nThe most common substance that replaces calcium carbonate in limestones\r\nis silica, in the form of _Flint_. The nodules of this material, white\r\non the outside and richly black within, mark bands of stratification\r\nin the Cretaceous chalk, and are among the best known materials in\r\nsouth-east England. Their fantastic forms have given rise to many\r\nspeculations. Sometimes, however, when fractured, they are clearly\r\nseen to include the remains of fossil sponges. The sponges may be\r\nrepresented merely as hollow casts; but there is abundant evidence in\r\nother cases that they belong to genera which secreted skeletons of\r\namorphous (non-crystalline) silica during life.\r\n\r\nThe nodular flint has collected round the sponge, while the sponge\r\nitself has often disappeared. G. J. Hinde[21] has shown how readily\r\nthe spicules of siliceous sponges go into solution. Even at the bottom\r\nof existing seas they become rounded at the ends, while their canals\r\nbecome enlarged. In some fossil instances, they are replaced by\r\ncalcite. W. J. Sollas[22], emphasising this point, remarks that \"it may\r\nbe taken as an almost invariable rule that the replacement of organic\r\nsilica by calcite is always accompanied by a subsequent deposition\r\nof the silica in some form or other.\" This subsequent deposition is\r\nfrequently at the expense of calcite in some other part of the rock.\r\nThe solid flint is a replacement of the limestone in which it occurs.\r\n\r\nThe pocket-lens will often show traces of sponge-spicules, as dull\r\nlittle rods, in the translucent substance of a flint. But the\r\nmicroscope shows that the mass of the flint has the structure of the\r\nlimestone in which it lies. The foraminifera and other small structural\r\nfeatures of the original rock are perfectly preserved in chalcedonic\r\n(that is, minutely crystalline) silica. Larger fossils, such as thick\r\nmolluscan shells and the tests of sea-urchins, may escape alteration,\r\nwhile the chalk mud, the original ooze, with which they are infilled\r\nhas become completely silicified. This explains the internal moulds\r\nof fossils in brown oxidised flint that are found in gravel-pits on\r\nthe surface of the Chalk, and also the tubular hollows, representing\r\nstems of crinoids, that often occur in flint from the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone. In the latter case, the fossil remained calcareous while\r\nthe ground became silicified, and the fossil was removed by subsequent\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nWhere great thicknesses of strata, as may happen in the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone, have become thus silicified, it may be presumed that\r\nsiliceous skeletons were unusually abundant in the mass. But, as\r\nL. Cayeux[23] observes, such skeletons may be in one case entirely\r\nremoved, and in another represented by massive flints; in yet\r\nanother case, the silica may remain disseminated through the rock.\r\nThe irregularity of its segregation is shown by the growth of flints\r\nin branching or hook-like forms, running from one bed to another in a\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nOolitic limestones and the skeletons of corals, both having been\r\noriginally made of aragonite, are often replaced by flint, forming\r\nconclusive instances, appreciable by the naked eye, of the secondary\r\norigin of this form of silica. Traces of diatoms are comparatively\r\nrare, though they probably contributed to the silicification of the\r\nfreshwater Calcaire de la Brie of the Paris basin. Radiolaria, however,\r\nhave now been well recognised as flint-formers, even in dark \"cherts\"\r\nof Silurian age. Radiolarian cherts have been taken as an indication\r\nthat the beds in which they occur were formed in oceanic depths.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine the stage in the history of a rock at\r\nwhich silicification has set in. As A. Jukes-Browne[24] remarks,\r\nsolution of the silica skeletons may be accelerated by pressure,\r\n_i.e._ by the depth of water in which the bed accumulated. Yet, in\r\ncomparison with the calcareous shells of foraminifera, radiolarian and\r\ndiatomaceous remains are only slowly soluble, and are found in the\r\ndeepest spots reached by soundings. H. B. Guppy[25], on the other hand,\r\nhas observed silicification of modern corals in reefs in the Fijis, and\r\nbelieves that the process went on during the elevation of the area,\r\nwhen waters containing silica became concentrated, and parts of the\r\nmass were exposed to evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe instability of the non-crystalline siliceous skeletons in\r\ngeological time makes it probable that a rock cannot long retain them\r\nwhen buried among other strata in the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that there is no support for the view, current from the\r\ntime of James Hutton onwards, that nodular flints are formed by matter\r\nin hot solutions entering pre-existing cavities in limestone rocks. But\r\nthere must be cases where the silicification of limestone has arisen\r\nthrough its penetration by hot springs. The presence of tabular flint\r\nin joints of the Chalk shows that water has imported silica along easy\r\nlines of passage from some other portion of the rock. Just as stems of\r\ntrees become replaced by chalcedonic silica, so may beds of limestone\r\nbe converted into flint, especially in volcanic areas. A. W. Rogers[26]\r\nrecords that recent limestones formed in the Cape province by the\r\nevaporation of ascending waters have already become silicified. These\r\nflinty rocks have been found in the Kalahari Desert and elsewhere,\r\nthough not south of the Orange River; the chemical change is probably\r\ndue to the character of local water rather than to temperature. Yet\r\nit is remarkable how, in the vast majority of instances, the partial\r\nor complete silicification of a limestone may be traced to an\r\nintermediate resting stage of the silica in the form of skeletons of\r\nthe vegetable diatoms or the animal sponges or radiolarians.\r\n\r\nThe decay of flint itself, by the removal of part of its substance\r\nin solution, is the cause of the white surface on specimens from the\r\nChalk, and of the crumbling white residues found in certain gravels.\r\nThis process has been fully discussed by J. W. Judd, who believes that\r\nthe material removed is silica in the opaline condition[27].\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMESTONE AND SCENERY\r\n\r\nLimestones in the field are characterised by joints which traverse\r\nconsiderable thicknesses of strata, until some shaly bed is met with,\r\nin which earth-stresses cannot set up such continuous planes of\r\nfracture. Since the conditions of deposition may remain constant for\r\na long time in open seas, and since stratification cannot be obvious\r\nuntil these conditions change, limestones may have a massive character\r\nthat is exceptional among sedimentary rocks. In some cases, however,\r\nwhere muddy rivers in times of flood have brought in detritus from the\r\nland, rapid and no doubt seasonal alternations of shale and limestone\r\nmay be observed.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk of north-western Europe remains typically soft, lending\r\nitself to cliff-formation along the coast, where landslides are\r\nfrequent through undercutting from below. Were it not for the\r\ndevelopment of flints along stratification-planes, it would be\r\nimpossible at a distance to detect any bedded structure in the rock.\r\nIts representatives in eastern France, in the north zone of the Alps,\r\nor in the central Apennines, are compressed into far more resisting\r\nmasses, and rear themselves as terraced crags and sheer rock-walls, in\r\nwhich the structure due to vertical joints is paramount. The English\r\nChalk weathers into round-backed downs, clothed with thin grass, and\r\nhollowed into combes by streams that have long ago run dry. The soil\r\nowes hardly anything but its abundant flints to the white limestone\r\nrock on which it lies. Residual clays and sands derived from the\r\nbreaking up of later beds allow of cultivation here and there, and\r\nbeechwoods flourish even on the crests of the high downs. But water\r\nsinks freely into the ground, and may so far saturate the mass as to\r\nappear again in wet seasons in hollows of the surface as temporary\r\nsprings or \"bournes.\" When deep wells are sunk and pumping is begun,\r\nit is found that the supply varies greatly in different spots under\r\nseemingly uniform conditions. Even in so permeable a mass, there are\r\nwaterways where maximum flow occurs. Channels where water soaks in\r\nfrom above, or weak places in the roofs of underground watercourses,\r\nbecome marked at the surface by sinkings known as swallow-holes. These\r\nincrease in size with time, and are abandoned to the growth of scrub\r\nand trees.\r\n\r\nAmong more consolidated limestones, as we have hinted, the joints\r\nare effective in promoting bold rock-scenery. The absorptive power\r\nof the rock, rather than its hardness, prevents it from being washed\r\naway. Water that might round the edges of escarpments and send down\r\ntaluses to modify the slopes sinks into the ground and works out\r\npassages by solution. On level surfaces, the solubility of limestone\r\nin water charged with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is apparent\r\nby the formation of pitted hollows, with edges between them that grow\r\nsharper until they are worn through. Where a rain-drop first secures a\r\nresting-place, its successors deepen the little hollow. Water lies in\r\nthis after every shower, working its way gently downwards. In time the\r\nrock may seem bored into as if prepared for blasting; the holes unite\r\nto form vertical grooves, and the surface is cut deeply into fantastic\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe face of the rock, formed by weathering on a valley-side or towards\r\nthe sea, or occurring on any mass that is being cut back and reduced\r\nby denudation, is likely to be vertical, or at any rate perpendicular\r\nto the bedding. The form of the surfaces of the beds is perpetuated by\r\ntheir fairly uniform lowering through solution. The result is that\r\nstratification surfaces and planes perpendicular to them control in a\r\nvery marked degree the scenery of limestone lands (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Surface of Limestone Plateau. Causse du Larzac,\r\nAveyron, France.]\r\n\r\nWhere the beds are level, with occasional partings of a slightly\r\ndifferent composition, the country will develop terraces, like those of\r\nthe Burren in northern Clare. Where they are folded, as in the Juras,\r\nscarps and dip-slopes follow one another picturesquely, the weathered\r\nedge of the bed, the true escarpment, being sometimes at an angle\r\nas steep as that of the dip. Hence a false effect of sharp peaks is\r\nproduced, when these \"edges\" are seen end on at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe terrace-structure may be seen in miniature forms upon a rocky\r\nshore, where the blocks loosened from the escarpments of the successive\r\nbeds are carried away by the waves. Frost-action is powerful in larger\r\ninstances, and sends down huge blocks upon the lower terraces. A\r\ncombination of shale bands and massive limestones, especially with a\r\ndip outward from the highland, leads to destructive landslips, since\r\nthe sloping surface of shale is lubricated by water that passes through\r\nthe limestone (see Fig. 9). Outward slips of the coast are thus common\r\nin Antrim, and have been extensive near Axmouth, two regions where\r\nchalk rests upon Liassic clays.\r\n\r\nBroken ground, then, occurs freely under limestone scarps, and the\r\nfalling blocks often prevent the growth of trees. The freshness of the\r\nrock-face above and of the talus below calls attention to spots where\r\ndenudation is most active. Differences in the constitution of the beds\r\nare indicated by differences of the slope formed by denudation on the\r\nrocky walls. The huge cañons of Arizona afford effective illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Ravine in Limestone. Cañon of the Dourbie,\r\nAveyron, France.]\r\n\r\nThese cañons owe much of their character to the presence of vertically\r\njointed limestone. The small rainfall of the region has allowed the\r\nrivers to deepen their channels ahead of the wearing back of the walls.\r\nYet even where valleys are widened by rain and other atmospheric\r\nagents, those formed in limestone will maintain the character of\r\nravines. In the valley-sides of Derbyshire, or of the Franconian\r\nplateau, or of the Arve near Sallanches, where the crags rise a mile\r\nor more above the stream, we see how cañon-cutting is assisted by the\r\njoints in limestone. The ravine of the Dourbie, east of Millau in\r\nAveyron, in the romantic region of the Causses, is a winding gorge two\r\nthousand feet in depth (Fig. 2). That of the Tarn, a little to the\r\nnorth, has only recently been penetrated by a road, cut out for the\r\nmost part in a vertical rock-wall.\r\n\r\nWhen we observe, especially from the stream itself, the details of\r\nthese sheer valley-sides excavated in limestone, we again and again\r\ndetect evidences of solution. High above the present water-level,\r\nthe rocks are rounded, and are often undercut, so that they overhang\r\n(Fig. 3). In Millersdale in Derbyshire, above grass-grown taluses,\r\nthe surface is still smooth to the hand, and we can picture the water\r\nswirling against it, and washing it away, as it does now in the bottom\r\nof the grim ravines of Carniola. It has been suggested, indeed, that\r\nsome limestone cañons represent underground waterways, the roofs of\r\nwhich have fallen in. This may be true of the fine gorge of Cheddar,\r\nand in some cases is proved by the existence of rock-arches bridging\r\nacross the hollow of the stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Waterworn Cliff of Limestone. Ravine of\r\nMillersdale, Derbyshire.]\r\n\r\nThe characters of an unmitigated limestone region are best seen\r\nwhen we travel east of the Adriatic. Here what have been styled the\r\n_karst_ landscapes become prominent, and may be followed through the\r\nGreek isles to the Levant. Something of the kind is realised in the\r\nterraced lands between the Rhône and the upper reaches of the Durance;\r\nlavender bushes form dull-green spots on almost barren hills, and\r\nthe grey walls of old stone-built towns are barely distinguishable\r\nagainst equally grey hillsides. But towards Trieste the limestone\r\nlands are barer still. The small amount of insoluble matter yielded\r\nby the rock may accumulate in swallow-holes, which are here called\r\n\"dolinas,\" a Slavonic word really meaning valleys. This residue\r\nappears in the dolinas as a red clayey earth, the \"terra rossa\" of the\r\nItalian-speaking Dalmatian coast. But on the surface of the plateaus it\r\nis washed or blown away as soon as it is extracted from the limestone.\r\nA. Grund[28] has suggested that the frequency of frost-action in\r\nmore northern areas allows surfaces of limestone to be cumbered with\r\nloose blocks among which soil-patches may gather; hence we do not\r\nfind karst-features on the plateaus of central Bavaria, Champagne,\r\nor the Cotteswold Hills. Something approaching to a karst appears in\r\nthe wind-swept levels of southern Galway and of Clare, and exposure\r\nto strong winds has probably a good deal to do with the origin of the\r\nCausses and the Illyrian karstlands. At the same time, the amount\r\nof impurity in the limestone must strongly influence the resulting\r\nlandscape. The noble woods in the limestone hollows of southern Ireland\r\nare rendered possible by the clay soils derived from the limestone, as\r\nmuch as by the sheltered nature of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Limestone Country Dissected by Ravines.\r\nKarstland of Hercegovina, from the Maklen Pass.]\r\n\r\nIn typical karstlands, water sinks in, and emerges again on low ground,\r\nwhere the surface-forms cut the level of the subterranean water-table.\r\nStreams that manage to hold their own for a time on the uplands often\r\ndisappear into the clefts. Marshes may occur in hollows, but may have\r\nno outlet, except in vertical directions, upwards by evaporation\r\nand downwards through the dolinas. The dolinas correspond, as the\r\nSlavonic shepherds so aptly perceived, to the river-valleys of more\r\nnormal areas. The landscape of flowing streams has to be sought for\r\nin a mysterious underworld, of which we can gain only a few glimpses.\r\nWhat we know is largely due to explorers of singular enterprise and\r\nresource, notably E. A. Martel and the \"spelæologists\" whom he has\r\ninspired.\r\n\r\nA view over the plateau of Hercegovina shows us how deep gorges, rather\r\nthan ordinary river-valleys, are prevalent where important streams run\r\nacross a karstland (Fig. 4). The roads are carried, where possible,\r\nalong the ravines, and the country possesses a double life, that of\r\nthe broad uplands, where tanks have to be made to preserve the water,\r\nand that along the commercial highways, four or five thousand feet\r\nbelow. Even beside the rivers there is a sense of desolation in the\r\nbarren whiteness of the rocks. The sunlight strikes on the wall of\r\nsome theatre of the limestone, carved out in old times by a side-swirl\r\nof the stream, and the hollow glares like a white furnace in the\r\nhills. The river in summer shrinks among broad stony reaches, to which\r\nthin-flanked sheep are driven for a scanty pasture. Its clear green\r\nwater gives no promise of alluvium for its banks. Limestone, even in\r\ntemperate Europe, may create the features of a desert land.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary rock-scenery in Europe is due to limestone in\r\nthe dolomitic state. It is not clear if the crags and pinnacles of\r\nTyrol are caused by the change from calcium carbonate into dolomite,\r\nwhereby a granular mass has arisen, weathering freely along its\r\nvertical joints. It may well be that these compact limestones have\r\ndeveloped an exceptionally jointed structure under earth-stresses, and\r\nthat faulting has intensified their tendency to break up into fort-like\r\nblocks. Stratified masses of more normal Rhætic limestones often\r\nprovide a terraced structure near the mountain-crests; but in thousands\r\nof feet of underlying dolomite vertical clefts prevail entirely over\r\nplanes of bedding. If, as is extremely probable, these dolomite-rocks\r\narose from the composite masses that we style coral-reefs,\r\nstratification was none the less a marked feature as their limestone\r\ngrew in thickness. This structure is still plainly visible; but the\r\njoints have been widened, and the mass is cut up into stupendous\r\npinnacles and dominating towers. The Drei Zinnen near Landro, the\r\ndeeply notched wall of the Langkofel and the Plattkofel, rising four\r\nthousand feet above a grassy upland of normal Lower Triassic strata,\r\nand the overhanging crests of the Sett Sass above Buchenstein, are\r\ntypes of a country where dolomite is pre-eminent, and where the zone of\r\nsteep rock-weathering is marked by the most fantastic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nON MARBLES\r\n\r\nAny limestone the markings or colour of which render it suitable for\r\nornamental purposes passes as a _Marble_. \"Fossil marbles\" are often\r\nmere grey limestones, in which the stems of crinoids, or the curved\r\nsections of shells, or the radiating patterns due to corals, please\r\nthe eye with their variety on a polished surface. The Purbeck Marble\r\nthat was so much used as a grey foil to the massive white columns of\r\ncathedrals throughout England is simply a freshwater limestone, of no\r\ngreat merit as a building stone, crowded with the shells of Paludina.\r\nThe black marbles are limestones coloured by one or two per cent. of\r\ncarbon, derived from the decay of organisms, and white shells may\r\nstand out in them conspicuously, in contrast with the ground. The\r\nred marbles of Plymouth and of Cork have become iron-stained, and at\r\nthe same time secondary crystallisation has destroyed many of their\r\noriginal features. In Little Island, near Cork city, earth-movements\r\nhave crushed the mass, which in consequence shows signs of solid flow.\r\nThe breaking of a crystalline limestone under such stresses furnishes\r\nus with many handsome marble _Breccias_. The abrupt juxtaposition of\r\nangular masses of various colours, torn from beds originally distinct,\r\nrenders some of these rocks almost too startling for the decoration of\r\nrooms of moderate size.\r\n\r\nThere seems no such thing in nature as amorphous carbonate of lime, and\r\nall limestones are therefore formed of crystalline particles; but the\r\nfurther crystallisation of this material produces a true marble, in\r\nwhich all traces of fossils may be lost. Heat and pressure underground\r\nprobably facilitate this change, since even soft chalk is converted\r\nby igneous dykes into granular marble. But where the pressure is\r\naccompanied by the possibility of movement, the shearing action breaks\r\ndown the grains, and a more delicate structure results.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (p. 35) how dolomite may undergo striking\r\nmineral changes through advanced metamorphic action. Lime-garnets,\r\nwollastonite, diopside, and other silicates similarly develop in\r\nordinary limestones exposed to the intrusion of an igneous magma. The\r\nextreme changes in such rocks will be described when amphibolites are\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SANDSTONES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF SANDS\r\n\r\nThe essential characteristic of Sandstone is that it consists mainly\r\nof detrital grains of quartz, or occasionally of grains of chalcedonic\r\nsilica (flint); these are found to scratch the steel blade of a knife,\r\nand are not affected by boiling in ordinary acids. The grains usually\r\nbecome cleaner in the boiling process, since the cement that has\r\nbound them together is liable to be destroyed. This cement may cause\r\neffervescence, being often formed of chemically deposited calcium\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the distribution of quartz in nature, we look\r\nto igneous and metamorphic rocks for the origin of the grains in\r\nsandstone. Quartz is one of the commonest minerals; but in granite and\r\nquartz-diorite it rarely forms more than half the bulk of the rock,\r\nfelspar and mica and hornblende being its associates. Veins of quartz\r\n(quartz-rock) traverse many rocks, and become broken up into granular\r\nforms on weathering; but they are inconsiderable in comparison with\r\nthe bulk of the slates or schists in which they lie. Mica-schists\r\ncontribute a good deal of quartz-sand when they decay; but this is\r\nmixed with ferruginous clayey matter, and the soils produced are yellow\r\nloams.\r\n\r\nWe are easily impressed, then, by the enormous amount of denudation\r\nthat was requisite to produce our existing sandstones. Though nowadays\r\nsandstones can be built up by the decay of older rocks of the same\r\nkind, the quartz must have come originally from igneous or metamorphic\r\nsources. Even in the metamorphic rocks, a large part of the quartz is\r\nprobably detrital.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic characters of the quartz in sandstone commonly attest\r\nits origin. The minute liquid inclusions, with moving bubbles, that\r\narise in the quartz of igneous and metamorphosed rocks, are easily seen\r\nin sections of sandstone. In some quartzites, these inclusions run in\r\ncontinuous bands from grain to grain, and have clearly arisen since the\r\ndetritus was cemented. But in ordinary sandstones the inclusions in\r\none grain have no relation to those in its neighbours. The felspars,\r\nmoreover, of igneous rocks are commonly found, as rolled fragments, in\r\nsandstone. Their grains are usually whiter and duller than those of\r\nquartz, and may easily be distinguished by the naked eye.\r\n\r\nSmall gleaming plates of mica from the parent rock may accumulate with\r\nthe quartz grains. The dark micas of decaying rocks, rich in iron and\r\nmagnesium, together with mineral silicates of calcium, magnesium, and\r\niron, such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes, form on hydration soft\r\ngreen chlorite. This mineral, in films and easily deformed flakes,\r\nat times occurs as a sort of groundwork to the coarser grains in\r\nsandstone, and colours the rock a delicate grey-green. Fine-grained\r\nsandstones of this type are difficult to distinguish from altered\r\n\"greenstones,\" such as basaltic andesites. When the quartz grains,\r\nhowever, are large, as in the grits quaintly styled in old days\r\n\"greywacke,\" they form a ready clue to the origin of the rock.\r\n\r\nNature sifts the products of decay so thoroughly, on any slope exposed\r\nto wind or rain, that the finest materials are carried far away, and\r\nthe undecomposable quartz remains predominant. The alluvium in the\r\nupper reaches of streams is thus far more sandy than the mixed material\r\nsupplied at the outset from the surrounding rocks. The more rapid flow\r\nof the water on the steeper upland slopes naturally removes the mud\r\ninto the lowland.\r\n\r\nWhen the detritus, still somewhat mixed, reaches a sea-shore,\r\nwave-action is rapidly effective. Before the continual wash and\r\npounding of the water, any residual clay, and the finely comminuted\r\nportion of the quartz, are carried down the coastal slope. The colour\r\nof the sea after storms is sufficient evidence of the work that it\r\nperforms. Beaches, then, arrive at a great similarity of type. The\r\ninviting yellow sands, formed of comparatively coarse material, occur\r\nalike off shores formed of chalk, slate, granite, or boulder-clay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Sand Developing from Sandstone, in semi-arid\r\nclimate. Near Laingsburg, Cape of Good Hope.]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of sedimentation, sands have thus tended to\r\naccumulate, and to become cemented into sandstones. These rocks, in\r\nturn uplifted and exposed, have yielded other sandstones. Since coarse\r\nsand does not travel far from the region where it is washed out of the\r\nparent rock, a thick mass of sandstone extending over many square miles\r\nmay waste away, and yet become perpetuated in the district. Sandiness\r\nthus begets sandiness, and the physical conditions due to the presence\r\nof sandstone may prevail through long geological epochs (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nOf course, a submergence beneath the sea may change all this in a brief\r\ntime; but wrinklings of the crust, raising the sandstones into severer\r\natmospheric levels, may only accelerate their decay and render the\r\nsurrounding lands more sandy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEMENTING OF SANDS\r\n\r\nThe cement of sandstones is very varied. On our modern coasts, springs\r\ndraining from a limestone land, or even running through banks of broken\r\nshells, will deposit calcite in the interstices of the beach, until\r\nslabs and shelves of conglomerate and sandstone arise in defiance\r\nof the waves. On coasts where calcium bicarbonate is abundant, it\r\nmay be precipitated by any cause that diminishes its solvent. Mere\r\nevaporation, and the escape of carbon dioxide from the water as it\r\nis scattered into spray, lead to the deposition of a cement between\r\nthe grains of sand. As Linck[6] shows, calcite is thus laid down in\r\ntemperate waters, while aragonite forms fibrous crystals between the\r\ndetrital fragments on the flanks of tropic isles. Aragonite may also\r\narise from the action of ammonium carbonate or sodium carbonate on\r\ncalcium sulphate or calcium chloride in sea-water. Sands thus become\r\ncemented by one or other form of calcium carbonate. They include,\r\nmoreover, calcareous algæ, foraminifera, and fragments of coral and\r\nsea-shells.\r\n\r\nFossil shells are usually represented in older sandstones by mere\r\nexternal and internal moulds. The texture of the rock allows of their\r\nbeing dissolved in percolating waters, while in clays belonging to the\r\nsame geological series they may be exquisitely preserved.\r\n\r\nIn shallows, and especially in lakes, where soluble salts of iron\r\nbecome readily oxidised, brown iron rust, the mineral limonite, is\r\ncontinually forming at the surface and sinking to the bottom, where\r\nit firmly cements the sand. A group of bacteria[29] extracts iron in\r\nthis form from the water of freshwater lakes and swamps, and greatly\r\naids in its accumulation. Though a red colour may appear also in marine\r\ndeposits, masses of red and purple conglomerates and sandstones may\r\nreasonably be assigned a freshwater origin. Such rocks are usually\r\nfound to be devoid of marine fossils, and they often contain traces of\r\nland plants.\r\n\r\nBarytes (barium sulphate), which sometimes occurs in veins simulating\r\nthose of calcite, is an occasional cement of sandstone, evidently\r\narising from subterranean waters.\r\n\r\nBands of flint (chert) occur in certain sandstones, such as the Hythe\r\nBeds of the English Lower Greensand Series. These are due to the\r\ncementing of certain layers by chalcedonic silica, and the source\r\nof this silica is seen in the hollow moulds of sponge-spicules, and\r\nthe glauconitic casts of their canals, that commonly remain. G. J.\r\nHinde[30] shows that in the Cretaceous examples, as in so many other\r\nflints, the majority of the spicules are of the tetractinellid type.\r\n\r\nUnder arid conditions, as in parts of Africa, loose superficial sands\r\nmay become cemented by calcium carbonate, or even by silica, brought up\r\nin water rising by capillary action from below.\r\n\r\nThe sand-dunes of the coast of our own islands, which cannot remain wet\r\nfor long, become in places toughened by a deposit of calcite derived\r\nfrom the abundant shells of land-snails. In the Cape of Good Hope[31]\r\nthe dunes, as A. W. Rogers states, are converted by invasions of\r\ncalcium carbonate, \"into hard rock through a distance of many feet from\r\nthe surface, and where repeatedly wetted and dried, as happens where\r\nthe sea has encroached upon old dunes, the rock becomes intensely hard\r\nand weathers with a peculiarly jagged surface.\" The General Post Office\r\nand the South African Museum in Cape Town are mainly constructed of\r\nthis recently consolidated rock.\r\n\r\nThe modern sandstones cemented by silica are still more interesting.\r\nIn the Cape of Good Hope, and notably in the Kalahari desert, they\r\nform the intensely hard rock known as _Quartzite_[32]. The cementing\r\nmaterial is true quartz, which sometimes deposits itself in bipyramidal\r\ncrystals about the grains of sand. The molecules of such crystals are\r\narranged in continuity with the grouping of those in the original\r\ndetrital grain, as is proved in thin sections under the microscope by\r\nthe optical continuity of the quartz of the grain and of its coating.\r\nAs silica continues to be deposited, the coatings interlock, and the\r\nrock passes into true quartzite. It is now often difficult to detect\r\nthe outline of the original grains. Such superficial quartzites may be\r\nten feet thick at most, with uncemented sand below. Rogers suggests\r\nthat the cementing process may have originated in shallow pools; but it\r\nhas obvious analogies with that which forms iron-pans and superficial\r\nmasses of calcium carbonate in regions where capillary waters are\r\nsubject to prolonged evaporation. H. G. Lyons[33] has attributed the\r\ncementing of parts of the Nubian Sandstone in the desert of Lower\r\nEgypt to the silica set free by the alteration of the felspars in the\r\nrock. This change, he suggests, was accelerated by the infiltration of\r\nsodium carbonate of local origin. Fossil trees in these strata have\r\nbeen replaced by silica. A further example is recorded by Armitage[34]\r\nfrom Victoria, where friable ferruginous Cainozoic sands have been\r\nconverted into quartzite. This type of rock, the hardest known, and\r\nassociated in our minds with high antiquity and metamorphic action,\r\nproves, then, to be in process of construction at the surface at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Rogers show that quartz and not mere chalcedony\r\nis deposited on the grains of sand. The \"crystalline sandstones\" of\r\nPermian and Triassic age in England may, then, have acquired their\r\nremarkable characters at the actual epoch of their accumulation. This\r\nis rendered the more probable by the recognised occurrence of arid\r\nconditions, at any rate seasonally, when the strata in question were\r\nlaid down.\r\n\r\nThese English \"crystalline sandstones\" were described by H. C.\r\nSorby[35], who showed that the quartz deposited on the detrital grains\r\nwas in optical continuity with that of the grains themselves. J. A.\r\nPhillips[36] regarded this quartz as crystallised out during the\r\nkaolinisation of felspars. The phenomena of laterisation, however,\r\ngive us a further suggestion as to the origin of the secondary\r\nsilica. It is now well known that tropical processes of weathering,\r\nwith alternations of wet and dry seasons, allow alumina to be set\r\nfree from combination with silica, \"lateritic\" crusts thus arising\r\non a great variety of rocks. The felspars of a sandstone may, under\r\nsuch conditions, become laterised rather than kaolinised, aluminium\r\nhydrate being left, and the silica passing into solution and appearing\r\nagain in certain layers as cementing quartz. The almost complete\r\ndisappearance of silica from the more advanced laterites shows that\r\nit has been carried away elsewhere, and the cement of quartzite may\r\nthus be derived from rocks at a considerable distance. Just, however,\r\nas the destruction of siliceous sponge-spicules implies the formation\r\nof flint, so laterisation implies silicification as a complementary\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe fact that secondary quartz in quartzite often arises in the rock\r\nitself is shown by the frequency of quartz-veins in quartzites, while\r\nthey are almost absent from associated slates or schists. Hence it\r\nappears that a removal of silica goes on at some points, leading to an\r\ninfilling of all the cracks and interstices at another.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that sandstones, according to the mode in which they\r\nhave been affected by percolating waters, may vary from the crumbling\r\nuncemented condition, known as _Sand-rock_, to that hardest and\r\nmost resisting of rocks, quartzite. The permeability of sandstone is\r\nresponsible for a wide variety of types.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAND-GRAINS OF SANDSTONE\r\n\r\nSandstones are originally permeable by water, not because they possess\r\na high percentage of pore-space, or \"porosity,\" but because the pores\r\nbetween the grains are large. Water can thus move easily by gravitation\r\nthrough the mass. The capillary rise or spread of water is greatest in\r\nmaterials of very fine grain, though in these it may be extremely slow.\r\nFor the most effective rise of water against gravity by capillary pull,\r\na large proportion of particles about ·02 mm. in diameter should be\r\npresent. Sand-grains, however, often measure ·5 mm. in diameter, and\r\nthe fine mud or highly comminuted sand between the coarser matter is\r\nthe cause of the spread of water through the mass when the supply comes\r\nfrom a subterranean water-table. Rain, however, is of course readily\r\nabsorbed. It disappears so rapidly on some barren sandstone areas,\r\ncoated as they are by loose sandy soils, that vegetation cannot make a\r\nstart, even where water is supplied.\r\n\r\nDaubrée, Sorby, and others have studied the characters of sand-grains,\r\nand it has been pointed out, that agitated water buoys apart and\r\ncarries forward by flotation grains with a diameter of ·1 mm. or less.\r\nHence coarser grains may become rounded like pebbles, by friction\r\non the bottom of a stream; but small ones remain angular throughout\r\ngeological periods, and even when transferred from one sandstone\r\nto another. When their surfaces have been cleaned by boiling in\r\nhydrochloric acid, the sharpness and irregularity of the quartz grains\r\nis strikingly apparent.\r\n\r\nMingled with these grains, in addition to the minerals previously\r\nmentioned, many interesting crystals appear that have become\r\nconcentrated in the natural washing processes. Minute colourless\r\nzircons and brown rutiles, derived from granite, have collected,\r\nowing to their high specific gravity, in certain sands. Magnetite and\r\nilmenite may darken the mass; monazite and thorite, which are sought\r\nafter for their constituents cerium and thorium, become similarly\r\nselected in alluvial hollows, owing to their density of 5. Whatever\r\ngathers thus in sands may become preserved in sandstones, and the study\r\nof thin sections of the latter under the microscope is fruitful in\r\nsuggestions as to their origin.\r\n\r\nSome sandstones are remarkable for their highly rounded and almost\r\nspherical grains. J. A. Phillips[38] compared these with the wind-worn\r\ngrains of deserts, which assume similar forms and a considerable\r\npolish. Large quantities of sand are carried from arid lands into\r\nrivers, into lakes, or into the sea, and hence well rounded grains,\r\nin bedded rocks, and even in marine sandstones, may have had a desert\r\norigin. J. W. Judd, when examining the deposits of Lower Egypt for the\r\nRoyal Society, commented on the extreme freshness of the felspathic\r\nparticles in sands accumulating in rainless areas, and recent\r\nobservations on the soils of semi-arid districts show their comparative\r\npoverty in clay. Enough has been said to indicate the variety of\r\ngeographical considerations that may arise from the examination of\r\nbeds of sandstone. The grains often prove, especially in the coarser\r\ntypes, to be fragments of rocks rather than isolated minerals, and thus\r\nfurnish a picture of the materials that formed the surface exposed to\r\ndenudation.\r\n\r\nThe sandstones of finest grain may be found in beds deposited almost on\r\nthe limits of sedimentation from the land, where they are interlocked\r\nwith material of truly pelagic origin. Marine muds often contain a high\r\npercentage of comminuted quartz, and the study of shales and slates of\r\nancient days shows how this almost indestructible mineral finds its way\r\ninto beds that might easily be classified as clays[41].\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME CHARACTERS OF SANDSTONE\r\n\r\nEarth-stresses and shrinkage give rise to joints in sandstone, which\r\nmay not be so clean and sheer as those in limestone, but which affect\r\neven the softer forms. Cemented sand-dunes of modern date tend to\r\nbreak away along vertical planes. Firmer sandstones give rise to\r\nstepped table-lands and \"edges,\" and the resistance of many types to\r\natmospheric decay renders their stratified structure strongly apparent.\r\nSmall intervals in the process of deposition, or slight changes in\r\nthe coarseness of the sand brought down by currents, give rise to\r\nlaminated and flaggy types. Where a broad shore has been exposed\r\nbetween tide-marks, the drying and compacting of the surface before\r\nthe next layer is laid down enables the latter to take a mould of the\r\ninequalities of that below. Ripple-marks, sun-cracks, rain-prints, and\r\nthe footmarks of animals, are often preserved in this manner. Where the\r\nshore is subsiding, they may persist through hundreds of feet of strata.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the best examples of these casts, and of the original\r\nstructure in the underlying bed, occur where a little mud has been laid\r\ndown over the sandy flat. Clay by itself, if damp, does not retain the\r\nimpressions sufficiently long, and, when once thoroughly dried, it\r\ncrumbles when the next water overflows it. But a foundation of firm\r\nsand with a thin mud-layer on its surface, as may be recognised in\r\nsome Triassic deposits, furnishes excellent records of local weather\r\nor of the movements of errant animals. On the flat shores of lakes in\r\na semi-arid climate, the water may retreat for miles, and return,\r\nperhaps months afterwards, when rains in the hills have given it a new\r\nburden of detritus. Under such conditions, broad sun-cracked flats\r\nmay be preserved, with perhaps some plant-remains between successive\r\nlayers[938].\r\n\r\nThe castings and tracks of worms, and the tubes of boring species,\r\nwhich are sometimes infilled by sand of a different colour, are common\r\nin sandstones of all ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICEOUS CONGLOMERATES\r\n\r\nThe deposits of wave-swept beaches leave us _Conglomerates_ formed\r\nof various types of pebbles, among which quartz-rock and quartzite\r\nnaturally predominate. In some cases the pebbles are ready formed when\r\nthey reach their resting-place. They come rolling out from lateral\r\ntorrents into the quieter waters of a main valley, as may be seen\r\nin summer in the broad pebble-banks of the north Italian streams.\r\nThence they are washed by occasional floods into the great confluent\r\ndeltas that constitute the upper part of an alluvial plain, or into\r\nlake-basins, where they promptly settle along the shore. But few such\r\npebbles, except from pre-existing conglomerates or gravels on the\r\nshore-line, actually reach the sea. The rolled stones upon sea-beaches\r\nare mostly the products of marine action on the spot. While the\r\nfine sand-grains go seaward almost unharmed, the detrital stones,\r\noffering far less surface in proportion to their mass, strike on their\r\nneighbours as every wave shifts them on the beach, and soon assume a\r\nrounded form.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerates ultimately consolidated may reveal stratification\r\nonly by the general arrangement of their pebbles. These can rarely\r\nbe spheres, since they are not as a rule turned over, but are pushed\r\nthis way and that until they acquire a flat ellipsoidal shape. They\r\nlie with their flatter sides in planes parallel to one another.\r\nGenerally, however, alternations of coarser and finer beds mark out the\r\nstratification even in conglomerates.\r\n\r\nThe sands of deserts include abundant stones and blocks of rock, and\r\nthe loose material becomes, moreover, sifted by the wind. True desert\r\nsands may accumulate at one point, the very finest loamy material may\r\nbe carried away still farther to form fields of fertile _löss_, and\r\na rock-desert, formed of stones resting on bare surfaces, may remain\r\nin large areas of the arid region. The loose stones here assume a\r\ncharacteristic shape, and have been known under the German name of\r\n_Dreikanter_. They are fairly flat below, and are cut away above by the\r\ndrifting sand into a form resembling a gable roof dipping at both ends.\r\nTheir surfaces are characteristically etched.\r\n\r\n_Dreikanter_ have been found in beds that were formerly ascribed to\r\ndeposition on the shores of lakes, and it must now be borne in mind\r\nthat continued attrition by drifting sand affects mixed detritus on\r\na land surface much as the wash of waters does upon a beach. Certain\r\nmaterials are cut away more rapidly than others, and the residue\r\nassumes a more and more quartzose type. In this way, sandstones,\r\nand conglomerates in which fragments of quartzite and vein-quartz\r\npredominate over other constituents, may arise as æolian beaches on dry\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDSTONE AND THE LAND-SURFACE\r\n\r\nThe permeability of sandstone has already been referred to. The surface\r\noffered by it is typically dry, and the soil, consisting mainly of\r\ngrains of siliceous sand, can neither retain the rain that falls nor\r\ndraw up water from below. The idea that trees can flourish on sandstone\r\nsoils because they require nothing from the soil itself is of course\r\nerroneous. They depend to a large extent upon the materials set free\r\nby the decay of certain grains, or of the cement of the underlying\r\nsandstone. In proportion as the sandstone is impure, that is, the more\r\nits constituents deviate from pure quartz, the more chance there is\r\nthat it will provide a fertile soil.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, areas of siliceous conglomerate and sandstone\r\nare given over, even in temperate climates, to forest and heather.\r\nWhere the sandstone is still in the sand-rock state, bare patches are\r\nlikely to appear even in the heath that has grown across it, and from\r\nthese the wind carries away shifting sands.\r\n\r\nEveryone familiar with the Carboniferous areas of the English midlands\r\nwill realise the influence of hard grit and sandstone in forming\r\n\"edges\" across the country. The contrast between these escarpments and\r\nthe slopes of crumbling shale that often underlie them gives diversity\r\nto the scenery of Yoredale and the Peak. The more yielding sandstones\r\nof Cretaceous age round about the Weald, or at the foot of the Chiltern\r\nHills near Woburn, form rounded hills, mostly clad with woods of\r\nconiferous trees. In Surrey, unpaved cart-tracks, used for centuries,\r\nhave cut gullies in the unconsolidated Folkestone Sands.\r\n\r\nThe underlying Hythe Beds, however, stand out between Reigate and\r\nGuildford as a bold escarpment, and it is interesting to reflect that\r\nthis fine feature of south-eastern England is probably due to the chert\r\nwhich the beds contain (see p. 62). The local growth of siliceous\r\nsponges in a Lower Cretaceous sea enables Leith Hill in our days to\r\ndominate even the arch of Ashdown Forest, where another unfilled\r\nsandstone area rises in the centre of the Weald.\r\n\r\nThe sands of Bagshot Heath, and numerous similar areas in the Paris\r\nBasin, show how impossible it is to cultivate such strata, even near\r\nthe best of markets. The flint gravels that cover much of the upland\r\nin the New Forest may also be borne in mind, as presenting the worst\r\nfeatures of highly siliceous lands.\r\n\r\nIn a semi-arid climate, or one with only seasonal rains, the processes\r\nby which sandstone begets sandstone tend to develop desert wastes. The\r\nsoils produced by weathering do not cake together, and are carried\r\naway by wind during the drier months. The bare rock appears over broad\r\nsurfaces, just as it does in storm-swept limestone areas, and any\r\nhollow where shelter is afforded tends to become filled with sand (see\r\nFig. 5).\r\n\r\nThe hummocky and extremely irregular surface of some of our Silurian\r\nareas, such as parts of the Southern Uplands of Scotland and the\r\nhard-won farmlands of Down and eastern Monaghan, is due to the presence\r\nof resisting sandstones among the shales. These sandstones, passing\r\ninto true grits, are repeatedly folded, and their upturned edges have\r\nresisted even the passage of glacier-ice. They jut out along the crests\r\nof ridges, and even the smaller beds furnish angular fragments to the\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Siliceous Conglomerate. Characteristic\r\nweathering; moraine-blocks at Coumshingaun, Co. Waterford.]\r\n\r\nFar wilder scenery is formed by the more continuous sandstone masses of\r\nthe Harlech Beds in western Wales, which are grits so firmly cemented\r\nthat the rock breaks across the quartz-grains. Much of the Old Red\r\nSandstone is of equally hard quality (Fig. 6). Its purple or grey\r\nconglomerates, the pebbles of which are quartzite in a quartz cement,\r\nform bare and rugged masses in the Great Glen south-west of Inverness,\r\nand are responsible in Kerry for some of the wildest rock-scenery in\r\nthe British Isles. Variations in coarseness allow of the development\r\nof a marked stratification on the weathered mountain sides, and\r\ndifferential erosion of the beds has taken place where ice has pressed\r\nagainst them. Even on precipices, grassy ledges may occur, marking\r\nbands of sandstone or shale in the conglomeratic mass.\r\n\r\nThe red sandstones and conglomerates that form huge outstanding bluffs\r\nfrom Applecross to the north of Sutherland represent the denudation\r\nof a pre-Cambrian mountain region. These Torridon Sandstones cover a\r\nvery irregular surface of old gneiss, with which their almost level\r\nstrata are in striking contrast. P. Lake[39] has compared them with\r\nthe deposits styled _dasht_ in Baluchistan and Afghanistan, which\r\nsimilarly fill up valleys and cover hills, as products of extensive\r\nand rapid denudation. There is much, indeed, to suggest that the\r\nTorridon Sandstone, some 10,000 feet in thickness, was accumulated in\r\na dry country on a continental surface, with the aid of floods during\r\noccasional rainy seasons.\r\n\r\nQuartzite, which fractures into small angular blocks under earth\r\nstresses, yields an intractable surface of bare rock and taluses of\r\nshifting stones. The latter sometimes crumble down into white sand,\r\nwhich provides some basis for the growth of heather. The numerous\r\njoints, independent of the bedding-planes, cause the rock to break up\r\nalmost equally on any exposed slope, and the crests of quartzite hills\r\nbecome typically converted into cones (Fig. 7). Viewed from a distance,\r\nthe white taluses, streaming down evenly from the crests, resemble caps\r\nof snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Quartzite Cone. Croagh Patrick, Co. Mayo.]\r\n\r\nThe absence of soil and the smoothness of weathered surfaces render\r\nquartzite mountains hard to climb. The uniform cementing of the rock\r\nleaves the bedding with little influence on the surface-features, and\r\nrock-ledges and shelves are rare. The traveller ascends over taluses\r\nof angular and obstinate blocks towards slippery and inhospitable\r\ndomes. But the wildness of the scenery will be his sure reward. It is\r\nof interest to reflect that the material of these bold outstanding\r\nmountains may in certain cases have originated, in all its hardness, in\r\nthe levels of a sun-parched plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCLAYS, SHALES, AND SLATES\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF CLAY AND SHALE\r\n\r\nThe question of what is a true _Clay_ has been much discussed,\r\nespecially by agriculturists, in recent years[939]. The material,\r\nas a rock, is regarded as a massive kaolin, and, if pure, should have\r\nthe following percentage composition:--silica 46·3, alumina 39·8, water\r\n13·9. Some _Pipe-clays_, white and uncontaminated, closely approximate\r\nto this ideal. True clays are very plastic when moistened, and shrink\r\non drying, forming a compact mass the particles of which do not fall\r\napart. When thoroughly dried, however, and placed in water, lumps\r\nof clay break up readily; the water creeps in along their capillary\r\npassages and expels trains of air-bubbles as it goes. This fact has\r\nbeen utilised in the extraction of fossils from a matrix of stiff clay.\r\nIf the clay thus reduced to powder is now \"puddled\" by the finger, it\r\nagain forms a closely adherent plastic mass.\r\n\r\nThe individual spaces between adjacent particles in a clay are very\r\nminute, and this accounts for its practical impermeability to water;\r\nbut the total pore-space or \"porosity\" may amount to more than fifty\r\nper cent. of the volume of the rock. Unless earth-pressures have\r\nbrought the mass into the condition of shale or slate, the tiny flaky\r\nkaolin particles, and the associated very small grains of other\r\nminerals, have not shaken themselves down into a closely aggregated\r\nstate. When moistened, however, and again dried, the surface-tension\r\nof the film of water about any group of grains, increasing as\r\nevaporation thins the film, draws the grains nearer to one another, and\r\na considerable shrinkage of the mass results. Alternate wetting and\r\ndrying tends to make a clay less obdurate and sticky, by increasing\r\nthe number of separate aggregates of grains. The passages between\r\nthese aggregates are no longer so minutely capillary, and a clay soil\r\nbecomes by this process distinctly \"lighter\" from the farming point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe larger cracks caused by shrinkage greatly increase the evaporation\r\nof water, by exposing new surfaces, which penetrate deeply into the\r\nclay. Often the mass shrinks so as to develop hexagonal structure, from\r\nthe drying surface downwards (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\nThe natural \"flocculation\" of clays, the process by which compound\r\ngrains are formed in place of individual soil-particles, is assisted\r\nby the action of water bearing certain salts in solution. Calcium\r\ncarbonate is an excellent flocculator, and this fact has long led\r\nfarmers to place burnt lime or powdered limestone on their lands.\r\nSodium carbonate, on the other hand, is brought up in some dry regions\r\nby capillary action, and exercises a reverse effect, keeping the minute\r\nparticles apart from one another, and thus promoting thorough clayiness\r\nin the clay.\r\n\r\nExperiment has shown that fineness of grain is responsible for most of\r\nthe characters of a clay, and from this point of view the small size of\r\nkaolin flakes as compared with grains of other minerals will account\r\nfor the \"clayiness\" of this particular mineral when it constitutes a\r\nrock. Clays, however, when shaken up in a column of distilled water,\r\ncause what seems to be a perpetual cloudiness, since it remains after\r\nthe great bulk of the clay has settled down. Flocculation by salts\r\nalone removes it. Some authors have urged that a colloid substance,\r\namounting perhaps to only one or two per cent. of the whole clay,\r\nimparts this distinctive character. Such colloids are believed to arise\r\nduring the decomposition of aluminous silicates under tropical and\r\nprobably alkaline influences; but they are not known to be associated\r\nwith the processes by which kaolin is formed from felspars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Shrinkage-cracks in Clay, with footprints of\r\nbirds in the foreground. Tundra of Mimer Bay, Spitsbergen.]\r\n\r\nA. D. Hall[40] points out that the cloudiness is probably due to the\r\nextreme minuteness of certain of the particles. True clayiness thus\r\ndepends on the proportion of grains smaller than ·002 mm. in diameter.\r\nYet Hall and Russell look to other causes to explain the continued\r\nsuspension of such particles in the water, and they suggest the\r\npresence of potassium and sodium silicates of the zeolite group, which\r\nliberate by hydrolysis a little alkali in contact with a large bulk of\r\nwater. Free alkalies prevent flocculation, and so encourage suspension\r\nof the particles.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary observer, a rock possesses the properties of clay,\r\nand is a clay, if it contains more than forty per cent. of particles\r\nless than ·01 mm. in diameter. But such rocks are found, on chemical\r\nanalysis, to contain a large amount of kaolin, and the old view, that\r\nclays are massive kaolins, is thus substantially correct.\r\n\r\nNone the less, clays are notably impure, and in many there is a large\r\nadmixture of quartz sand. The kaolin, derived originally from the decay\r\nof other silicates, is rarely freed from a variety of minerals and\r\nrock-fragments that were associated with it in its place of origin.\r\nGrains of quartz and unaltered felspar a tenth of a millimetre in\r\ndiameter distinctly \"lighten\" a clay soil, on account of their relative\r\ncoarseness. A sandy clay is styled a _Loam_, and a fine-grained loam\r\nfurnishes the ideal soil for the general purposes of a farmer. It\r\ndoes not retain water too long upon its surface, nor does it dry too\r\nquickly after rain. Much of what we call boulder-clay proves to be in\r\nreality a loam.\r\n\r\nT. Mellard Reade and P. Holland[41] have shown that even in clays of\r\nmarine origin there may be a considerable proportion of very fine\r\nquartz sand.\r\n\r\nCalcium carbonate, usually occurring as fine rock-dust derived from\r\nlimestone, or as minute shell-fragments, may be mingled with clay to\r\nform a _Marl_. The term is not a quantitative one, and may be applied\r\nto any clay that shows a brisk effervescence with cold acids. Though\r\nunpleasantly sticky when wet, marls flocculate themselves naturally by\r\nsupplying calcium carbonate in solution to waters that pass through\r\ntheir crevices (see p. 80).\r\n\r\nThe stratification of clays may be invisible throughout considerable\r\nmasses, unless sandy beds are intercalated among them. Yet, when a lump\r\nof clay is dried and then placed in water, as previously described, it\r\nwill often break up along parallel planes, which show that there is a\r\nregular arrangement of its particles. The fact that so many of these\r\nparticles are platy becomes emphasised under the pressure of subsequent\r\nsediments, whereby the platy surfaces of the particles are brought into\r\nplanes parallel with one another. The clay then becomes a _Shale_, with\r\nregular planes of fissility, which are parallel to those of bedding.\r\nA certain amount of deformation of the rock accompanies this change,\r\nflow being set up parallel with the bedding, and included fossils\r\nbecoming sometimes flattened. This deformation is especially noticeable\r\nin the case of plant-remains. Shales may in time attain the density and\r\nfissile structure of true slate.\r\n\r\nThe colours of clays and shales are of considerable interest. Blackness\r\nis often due to organic matter, and especially to fragments of plants,\r\nwhich retain their woody structure and their carbonaceous character\r\nwhen protected by clay from oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe bluish tint of clays is due to finely divided iron pyrites (iron\r\ndisulphide), which may occasionally appear as distinct crystals\r\nor nodules of one or other of its forms, pyrite or marcasite. On\r\noxidation, limonite arises, which colours the mass brown, as is seen in\r\nthe upper part of many clay-pits. The occurrence of iron pyrites often\r\ndates back to the time at which the clay accumulated. N. Andrussow[42]\r\npoints out that in the Black Sea there is an enormous supply of\r\ndecaying organic matter provided by the floating organisms of the upper\r\nlayers. This rains continually down towards the floor. The portion\r\nthat reaches depths of over 100 fathoms escapes from the voracity of\r\nfree-swimming organisms and arrives at the region where bacteria alone\r\nabound. These bacteria act on dissolved sulphates, and also largely,\r\naccording to Andrussow, on the albumen of the decaying matter. In\r\nboth cases, sulphuretted hydrogen is produced. Andrussow treats the\r\nreduction of the marine sulphates as a minor process, due to the\r\nneed that the bacteria have for oxygen in the deep waters, which are\r\ninsufficiently supplied. The sulphuretted hydrogen attacks the salts of\r\niron, and iron disulphide results.\r\n\r\nHere we have an excellent illustration of how, in deep basins, with\r\nimperfect vertical circulation, black pyritous muds may arise, devoid\r\nof ordinary fossils. The depths of the Black Sea are practically\r\npoisoned by the abundance of sulphuretted hydrogen. But numerous cases\r\nof shales are known to us where iron pyrites replaces the shells of\r\nammonites or forms complete casts of bivalves, and has accumulated also\r\nin concretions and crystalline groups. Such pyrites is probably of\r\nsecondary origin, or arose from the reducing action of decaying organic\r\nmatter on ferrous sulphate in solution in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe oxidation of iron pyrites in shales gives rise to aluminium\r\nsulphates, such as alums. Sometimes sufficient heat is evolved during\r\nthis oxidation to set on fire carbonaceous matter present in the rock.\r\n\r\nPink-purple and green are common colours among shales, and imply that\r\nthe iron is in two different states of oxidation. When the colour\r\nvaries thus in successive bands, we may believe that a climatic change\r\npromoted the formation of ferric salts on the land surface when the\r\npink layers were being formed, while ferrous (less oxidised) salts\r\npredominated when the green particles were washed into the basin. B.\r\nSmith[43] suggests that the organic matter and humic acids which are\r\nswept down in times of flood may temporarily prevent oxidation from\r\noccurring in shallow lakes and pools. Dry seasons would thus lead to\r\nthe deposition of pink clays, while wet seasons would furnish green\r\nones. The green colour in shales is mostly due to chlorite or to\r\nglauconite.\r\n\r\nSubsequent deoxidation has been invoked to account for the green colour\r\nof certain shales. Organic matter may have been responsible, and the\r\ngreen spots in purple slates have been attributed to the decay of\r\nentombed organisms, the reaction having spread outwards from a centre.\r\n\r\nClays, owing to their impermeability, preserve fossils excellently,\r\nand the oldest shells and corals in which the original aragonite has\r\nescaped conversion into calcite occur in clays and shales of Mesozoic\r\nage (see p. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF CLAYS\r\n\r\nSomething has been said on this matter in the foregoing paragraphs.\r\nIt is now recognised that a pure china-clay or a pipe-clay, that is,\r\na pure kaolin-earth, does not arise from the sifting of the products\r\nof surface-denudation. The alkali felspars decompose as they lie in\r\nexposed layers of granite and gneiss, but the kaolin thus formed under\r\nthe acid action of atmospheric waters is relatively small in quantity,\r\nand cannot escape from its coarser associates, such as undecomposed\r\nfelspar and quartz, until it is carried away far from land. Even then,\r\nas the records of H.M.S. \"Challenger\" show[44], marine muds may contain\r\nmore than fifty per cent. of detrital quartz-grains, and quartz is\r\nalways the most abundant mineral among the larger particles of the mud.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, decomposition of the granitoid rock has been\r\nexceptionally thorough, kaolin may be present in sufficient quantity to\r\npredominate over other materials. The product washed from the surface\r\nthen gathers as a white clay even in lakes, and further artificial\r\nwashing may extract from it an actual kaolin-earth or china-clay. In\r\nsuch cases, the rock has become rotted throughout in consequence of\r\nsubterranean action. Hydrofluoric acid as well as other gases have been\r\nat work, as is shown by the secondary minerals associated with the\r\nkaolin; and the appearance of white powdery kaolin in unusual abundance\r\non the surface is due to the local exposure of a mass that was long ago\r\nmade ready in the depths.\r\n\r\nThe sifting action, however, of running waters, and especially of the\r\nsea upon a shore, ultimately causes clayey matter to be carried away\r\ninto regions where it is slowly deposited. The flocculating action of\r\nthe salts dissolved in sea-water greatly assists the precipitation of\r\nclay before it has reached some two hundred miles from land. However,\r\njust as sandstone begets sandstone, clays or shales exposed upon a\r\ncoast produce new clays close to shore. The estuary of the Thames and\r\nmany \"slob-lands\" serve as examples. Off Brazil, red clays arise[45]\r\nfrom the large quantity of \"ochreous matter\" carried from the coast.\r\nModern green marine muds are found to contain glauconite, a silicate\r\ncommon in the English Gault clays, and formed by interactions in the\r\nsea itself. Modern blue muds[46] are recorded down to 2800 fathoms, and\r\ncontain organic matter and iron disulphide.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written by the observers on the \"Challenger\" and by\r\nothers on the red clay of truly abyssal depths, which is attributed to\r\nthe decay of wind-borne volcanic dust, and of igneous matter erupted on\r\nthe sea-floor, rather than to any direct transport by water from the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nClays may also accumulate on a land-surface from fine volcanic ash,\r\nwhich decomposes through the action of percolating waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLATE\r\n\r\nThe relations between shale and _Slate_ are so obvious that slate may\r\nreadily be regarded as a very well-compacted mud. The clayey material\r\nin it, like that of muds, may be ordinary detritus or of volcanic\r\norigin; its colours repeat those of shales. Its essential character,\r\nhowever, is the possession of a \"cleavage,\" that is, of well-developed\r\nplanes of fissility, which are often inclined to those of bedding.\r\nThe bedding may be indicated by bands of different coarseness or\r\nconstitution, and these may show crumpling due to pressure that has\r\nbeen exerted on the mass. The cleavage, however, may run right across\r\nthese bands, and the rock, as a rule, splits far more cleanly along the\r\ncleavage-planes than a shale does along its planes of bedding.\r\n\r\nThe early and historic observations on slaty cleavage have been\r\nexcellently reviewed by A. Harker[47], who also provides an independent\r\ninvestigation. Reference may also be made to a later treatise by C. K.\r\nLeith[48], which contains numerous illustrations, and to a discussion\r\nby G. W. Lamplugh[49]. D. Sharpe and H. C. Sorby, between 1847 and\r\n1853, developed the theory that rock-cleavage was due to compression in\r\na direction perpendicular to the planes of cleavage and to expansion\r\nalong them. As Harker points out, it is unlikely that the expansion\r\nbalances the compression. The density of slate, about 2·7, is a good\r\nindication that the \"porosity,\" or percentage of pore-space, has been\r\nreduced, while the mineral changes, soon to be referred to, are also in\r\nfavour of greater density. C. Darwin[50] laid stress on the connexion\r\nbetween cleavage and the development of flaky minerals, such as micas,\r\nalong the cleavage-planes, the structure ultimately passing into that\r\nknown as \"foliation\" (see p. 145). H. C. Sorby urged that compression\r\nbrings platy particles into parallel positions throughout the mass, so\r\nthat the plates, which may consist of kaolin, mica, or chlorite, come\r\nto lie with their broad surfaces perpendicular to the direction of\r\ncompression. At the same time, any constituents capable of deformation\r\nbecome compressed in this direction, become expanded in a direction\r\nperpendicular to it, and are themselves converted into lens-like\r\nforms or plates. T. Mellard Reade and P. Holland[51] have emphasised\r\nthe part played by crystallisation at the close of the process of\r\ncompression. They urge that the platy minerals, mica and chlorite, are\r\nproduced during the alteration of the rock, and can spread with ease in\r\ndirections perpendicular to that of compression; they thus give rise to\r\nslaty cleavage at a late stage in the deformation of the rock. These\r\nauthors, it will be seen, have developed one of Darwin's principal\r\npropositions, as to the close connexion between rock-cleavage and\r\nfoliation, and, in opposition to Sorby, consider the platiness of the\r\noriginal constituents to be of less importance.\r\n\r\nIn support of their view, in regard to the late stage at which\r\ncleavage is induced, it may be noted that the crystals of pyrite and\r\nmagnetite that sometimes occur in slates and in the allied foliated\r\nschists have developed at an earlier date as knots which oppose the\r\ncleavage or the foliation[52].\r\n\r\nDarwin observed that mineral differences sometimes occur along bands\r\nparallel with the cleavage-planes. In such cases, the difference may be\r\nlargely one of grain, shearing having broken down the minerals into a\r\nfiner state along certain bands of movement[53]. Shearing of the rock\r\nmay occur along any of the cleavage-planes, which are superinduced\r\nplanes of weakness, and parts of the slate thus slide over others,\r\njust as the mineral flakes slide over one another in the directions in\r\nwhich expansion of the rock is possible. Where traces of the original\r\nstratification remain, it is easy to see if rock-shearing has occurred.\r\n\r\nBeds of different composition naturally take on cleavage in very\r\ndifferent degrees. Sandy layers show the compression that has taken\r\nplace by contorting; but they cleave very poorly, and in proportion\r\nto the amount of mud present in them. Where clayey and sandy layers\r\nalternate, and the direction of the cleavage is oblique to them, it is\r\nrefracted, as it were, on passing from one layer to the other; it is\r\nmore highly inclined to the bedding in the sandy layers and less so in\r\nthe clayey layers. Hence a cleavage-surface forms a fold resembling\r\nthe shape of an italic _S_ as it traverses each harder bed. Harker[54]\r\nand Leith[55] discuss the cause of this from somewhat different points\r\nof view. It is probable that such cleavage-planes as develop within\r\nthe hard bed are approximately perpendicular to the direction in which\r\nthe compressive force acts, because there is in such beds little\r\npossibility of lateral creep of the material along the bedding-planes.\r\nIn the softer layers, we have to deal, not only with a tendency\r\ntowards the rotation of platy particles until their flat surfaces are\r\nperpendicular to the direction of pressure, but also with a tendency\r\nof the same particles to flow along the bedding-planes. The resultant\r\narrangement gives rise to a cleavage nearer to the bedding-planes than\r\nthat in the more sandy layers.\r\n\r\nSometimes, after the cleavage is established, compression folds it,\r\njust as strata may be folded. Still greater compression may obliterate\r\nit and establish a new cleavage, and all gradations towards this\r\nresult are traceable. The cleavage layers, again, may be wrinkled into\r\na series of sharp folds, thrust over in one direction, and parting\r\nmay then take place along the ridges of these folds, which furnish\r\na second series of planes of weakness in the rock. This type of\r\nseparation has been styled a _strain-slip cleavage_, and by Leith a\r\n_fracture-cleavage_, in distinction from ordinary or _flow-cleavage_.\r\nShearing may take place along it, and the true or flow cleavage-planes\r\nbecome thus broken across and faulted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Landslide of Limestone over Shale. Near\r\nLuc-en-Diois, Drôme, France. The scale is shown by the main road\r\npassing among the blocks.]\r\n\r\nCommercial slates should exhibit none of these structures that\r\ninterfere with genuine cleavage. An argillaceous rock of uniform\r\ngrain, compressed evenly over a considerable district, is required\r\nfor successful slate-quarries. Yet all quarrymen will admit that the\r\nmaterial varies from point to point, and that the best slate runs in\r\n\"veins.\" Some of the coarser slates, with irregular surfaces, and\r\nwith splashes of colour, such as are provided by limonite, are sought\r\nafter for their picturesque effect; while slates which do not split\r\nreadily enough for roofing purposes may have their use for flags,\r\nmantel-shelves, and billiard-tables.\r\n\r\n\r\nARGILLACEOUS ROCKS IN THE FIELD\r\n\r\nObviously, nothing can be more different than the features of a country\r\nmade of clay, when acted on by denudation, and those of one where\r\nslate prevails. In the former case, low rounded hills rise, without\r\nany definite arrangement, above hollows where rushes spring amid the\r\ngrass. The streams are muddy, and they readily cut their way down to\r\nbase-level, meandering thenceforward in a clay-alluvium. Shales provide\r\nbolder features, but crumble rapidly where the climate permits of frost\r\nand thawing. They may be protected by more resisting rocks, but provide\r\noozy surfaces underground, over which the higher masses may slide\r\ndisastrously (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Weathering of Shale. Granite mountains behind.\r\nAbove La Grave, Lautaret Pass, Isère, France.]\r\n\r\nShale-beds, when uplifted and folded, slip away in flakes from one\r\nanother, supplying very ragged and irregular material to the taluses,\r\nand exposing shimmering surfaces when damp with rain (Fig. 10). Among\r\nhilly lands, the passes will often be found to be due to bands of\r\nshale, which are cut down by weathering far sooner than the rocks on\r\neither hand. In central England, the Lias shales, despite the presence\r\nof some limestones, have been worn down almost to a plain, wherever the\r\noverlying Middle Jurassic limestone has been removed.\r\n\r\nSlates, with their ragged edges and resistance to rain, play their\r\npart in wilder mountain-scenery. Frost-action destroys them, producing\r\ntaluses that slip frequently towards the valleys; but the residual\r\ncrags assume more serrated forms, in contrast with the smooth covering\r\nof the lower slopes. The cleavage, when steeply inclined to the\r\nhorizontal, promotes the cutting of gullies down the mountain-sides,\r\nand the intervening ribs of rock may easily be mistaken for uptilted\r\nstrata. The entrance to the Pass of Llanberis at Dolbadarn is a fine\r\npicture of slate-scenery. Eventually, mountains formed of slate\r\nassume hog-backed and rounded forms, but they still, where notched by\r\nstreamlets, yield sheer cliffs and picturesque ravines.\r\n\r\n\r\nON BOULDER-CLAY\r\n\r\nThe material known as _Boulder-Clay_ presents such distinctive\r\nfeatures, and is so prevalent in our islands, that it deserves a\r\nfew separate remarks. From a coating a foot or two in thickness, it\r\nswells in places to a hundred feet or more, and may form the important\r\nround-backed hills to which Maxwell Close reserved the name of\r\n_drumlins_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Boulder-Clay, Crich, Derbyshire.]\r\n\r\nIt consists essentially of mixed materials, unsifted by water, huge\r\nboulders of various rocks occurring side by side with angular fragments\r\nand pebbles of all sizes, set in a groundwork of loamy clay (Fig. 11).\r\nSands and gravels are often associated with the boulder-clay, and\r\nresult from the local washing of the mass in copious floods of water.\r\nThe blocks are here on the whole more rounded, and the sandy part of\r\nthe loam predominates.\r\n\r\nBlocks of shale and limestone, and even of sandstone and quartzite,\r\noccurring in the boulder-clay, bear the characteristic striations that\r\nwe now recognise as due to glacial action. The sand and small stones\r\nhave, in fact, been held against the larger ones by solid ice, and have\r\ncut and grooved their surfaces. Shales and schists have gone to pieces\r\nand have provided the clayey groundwork. The whole of the material has\r\nbeen at one time embedded in and moved forward by glacier-ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Arctic Glacier charged with stones and clay.\r\nSide of the Nordenskiöld Glacier, Billen Bay, Spitsbergen. The top of\r\nthe ice appears in the left-hand upper corner of the picture.]\r\n\r\nThough Louis Agassiz developed his glacial theory from studies in\r\nSwitzerland, he possessed an imagination that ran before the knowledge\r\nof his time. Swiss glaciers are now so limited that they are of very\r\nlittle use to us when we seek to explain the origin of boulder-clay. In\r\narctic and antarctic lands, however, we meet with continental glaciers,\r\nmany miles in width, moving across lowlands, in virtue of the pressure\r\nfrom some great snow-dome, to which additions are continually being\r\nmade behind them. Even when fed by diminished snow-fields, like those\r\nin Spitsbergen, these glaciers dominate the landscape and form the\r\nprincipal rock-masses over hundreds of square miles. Such glaciers\r\ngather into their lower portions all the loosened material on the\r\nhill-slopes and valley-floors. With the tools thus supplied, further\r\nmaterial is plucked from jointed or fissile rocks as the mass moves\r\nforward. Freezing and thawing at the base of the great ice-sheet,\r\nas water flows here and there beneath it, further disintegrate the\r\nrocky floor. The broad ice-sheet sinks in a mass of broken rock and\r\nsludge at one point, and at another drags this mixed material forward\r\nas an abrading agent. The lower half of such a glacier, or the whole\r\nthickness of it near its front, where surface-melting has removed the\r\nhigher layers, is in reality an agglomerate of stones and mud held\r\ntogether by an ice-cement (Fig. 12). When an epoch of advance is over,\r\nwhen the ice-sheet stagnates and its frozen constituent melts away,\r\nit becomes more and more like a boulder-clay as time goes on. True\r\nboulder-clay then forms its surface, while ice remains plentiful below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Arctic Glacier and Boulder-Clay. The Sefström\r\nGlacier, Ekman Bay, Spitsbergen, in 1910, with boulder-clay in\r\nforeground, marked by kettle-holes, and deposited by an advance of the\r\nglacier over Cora Island in 1896.]\r\n\r\nSince the stony matter is not evenly distributed, some parts of the\r\nsurface sink more quickly than others, through loss of a greater\r\nportion of their former bulk. Roughly circular pits or \"kettle-holes\"\r\nappear, in which water gathers. The water running from these washes\r\nacross a part of the boulder-clay, bears off the mud, and leaves bands\r\nof sand and gravel. The clayey portion thus removed may accumulate as\r\na fine deposit in other outlying pools, and is interstratified, when\r\nthe flow of water is temporarily increased, with coarser and more sandy\r\nlayers. Ultimately, the frozen water of the groundwork drains away, and\r\nonly the stones and clay of the ice-sheet remain upon the field. They\r\nform, however, a very important residue, weathering in steep cliffs\r\nand pinnacles in the dry air of the arctic lands. The boulder-clay thus\r\nleft shows a sharply marked boundary where the edge of the stagnating\r\nice-sheet lay. It is, in fact, the surviving part of the complex sheet,\r\nand now undergoes moulding, like other rocks, by atmospheric agencies\r\n(Fig. 13).\r\n\r\nMany interesting features of the hills called drumlins cannot be\r\ndiscussed here. Their arrangement with their longer axes in the\r\ndirection of the movement of the ice shows that they were moulded in\r\nlarge measure within the ice itself, and came to light as it melted\r\naway from above downwards. They may be regarded as originating in tough\r\nand mixed materials, ice and stones and clay, from the lower layers\r\nof the ice-sheet, which became associated with the purer upper ice in\r\ncertain episodes of the flow. Such mingling may occur at an ice-fall,\r\nor where shearing over an obstacle takes place. In the former case, the\r\nupper ice descends into the lower layers; in the latter, masses from\r\nbelow are pushed up into higher levels. As the forward flow proceeds,\r\nthe masses representing the lower and stone-filled layers are treated\r\njust as \"eyes\" of coarser material are treated in a fluidal lava or in\r\na rock deformed by metamorphic pressures. The purer and more plastic\r\nice moves past and round them, and they assume an elongated form[56].\r\nWhen final stagnation and melting have gone on, these masses are still\r\nseparated from one another as rounded hills. Their bases have settled\r\ndown upon the ice-worn surface, but their flanks and crests retain\r\ntraces of the moulding action of the purer portions of the complex body\r\nstyled an ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nIn recent years great interest has been aroused by researches on\r\nboulder-clays of ancient date, especially those of Permo-Carboniferous\r\nage[57]. These compacted deposits contain abundant striated boulders,\r\nand rest on glaciated rock-surfaces, which have a surprisingly modern\r\naspect when laid bare by denudation. The grey-green Dwyka Conglomerate\r\nthat is so widely spread throughout South Africa forms \"kopjes\" on\r\nthe borders of the Great Karroo, with spiky crests and irregularly\r\nweathered cliffs; but its original deposition as a boulder-clay has\r\nbeen amply verified. It has now, moreover, been paralleled by a very\r\nsimilar rock discovered by A. C. Coleman in the Huronian beds of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION[58]\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks, those varied masses that have consolidated from a state\r\nof fusion, attracted attention in the eighteenth century through their\r\nactive appearance in volcanoes. James Hutton in 1785 showed that the\r\ncrystalline granite of the Scottish highlands \"had been made to invade\r\nthat country in a fluid state.\" More than a hundred years, however,\r\nelapsed before geologists on the continent of Europe were willing to\r\nconnect superficial lavas with the materials exposed by denudation in\r\nconsolidated cauldrons of the crust.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting therefore to note that G. P. Scrope in 1825 treated\r\nof granite, without apology or hesitation, in a work entitled\r\n\"Considerations on Volcanoes.\" So far from separating deep-seated from\r\nsuperficial products, Scrope wrote of the molten magma in the crust as\r\n\"the general subterranean bed of lava.\" He conceived this fundamental\r\nmagma, \"the original or mother-rock,\" to be capable of consolidating\r\nas ordinary granite. Successive meltings and physical modifications of\r\nthis granite gave rise, in his view, to all the other igneous rocks.\r\nScrope laid no stress, however, on chemical variations within the\r\nmagma, but urged that the transitions observable between different\r\ntypes of igneous material established a community of origin.\r\n\r\nThe connexion between lavas and highly crystalline deep-seated rocks,\r\nso simply accepted by Scrope, was worked out some fifty years later\r\nby J. W. Judd for areas in Hungary and in the Inner Hebrides. The\r\nfeatures displayed in thin sections under the microscope were used by\r\nJudd, in a series of papers, to substantiate his views; but in France\r\nand Germany these features became the source of subtle distinctions\r\nbetween the igneous rocks of Cainozoic and pre-Cainozoic days. The\r\nlavas, in which some glassy matter could be traced, were said to\r\nbe typically post-Cretaceous, and essentially different from those\r\nearlier types in which glass was replaced by finely crystalline matter;\r\nwhile the coarsely crystalline igneous rocks were uniformly regarded\r\nas pre-Cainozoic. Glassy rocks, such as pitchstone, interbedded\r\ncontemporaneously in Permian or Devonian strata, were described as\r\n\"vitreous porphyries,\" while those known to be of post-Cretaceous date\r\nmight be styled andesites, trachytes, or rhyolites. Luckily common\r\nsense has recently triumphed in this matter, and the relative scarcity\r\nof glassy types of igneous rocks in early geological formations has\r\nbeen recognised as due to the readiness with which glass undergoes\r\nsecondary crystallisation. The discussion has ended by showing that we\r\nhave no evidence of world-wide changes in the types of material erupted\r\nduring geological time.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, attention has been focused on the processes\r\nthat go on in subterranean cauldrons, in the hope of explaining the\r\ndifferences between one type of extruded rock and another. Doctrines\r\nof descent have been elaborated, and one of the most subtle systems\r\nof classification[59] has been based upon characters that the igneous\r\nrock might have possessed, had circumstances not imparted others\r\nto it during the process of consolidation. The principle of this\r\nclassification is, however, obviously correct, if we wish to trace back\r\na rock bearing certain characters at the present day to the molten\r\nsource from which it came.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\nThe characters of igneous rocks vary considerably according as they\r\nhave consolidated under atmospheric pressure only, or under that of\r\nsuperincumbent rocks. We must remember also that submarine lavas have\r\nto sustain a pressure of an extra atmosphere for every thirty feet of\r\ndepth, or 400 atmospheres at 2000 fathoms, and that such rocks have\r\na claim to be regarded as deep-seated. The gases that igneous rocks\r\ncontain, probably as essential features of the molten magma, and at a\r\ntemperature above their critical points, escape to a large extent near\r\nor at the surface of the earth. The bubbles raised in lava, whereby it\r\nis rendered _scoriaceous_, and the clouds of vapour rising from cooling\r\nlava-flows and from the throat of a volcano in eruption, are sufficient\r\nevidences of this process. The extremely liquid lavas of Kilauea in\r\nHawaii, which emit very little vapour, are notable as exceptions. In\r\nthe case of masses that cool underground, the retention of gases, and\r\nultimately of liquids, until a very late stage of consolidation retards\r\ncrystallisation until temperatures are reached lower than those at\r\nwhich it starts in surface-flows. As A. Harker points out[60], \"the\r\nloss of these substances, by raising the melting-points in the magma,\r\nmay be the immediate cause of crystallisation, quite as much as any\r\nactual cooling.\"\r\n\r\nThe formation of crystals in lavas is rapid, and the average crystals\r\nare therefore small, and often felted together in a mesh, the\r\ninterstices of which are filled by residual glass.\r\n\r\nSlowness of cooling is the really important factor that affects the\r\nsize of crystals, that is, the coarseness of grain, in igneous rocks.\r\nPressure may promote crystallisation, by raising the melting-points of\r\nminerals; but, after a certain maximum effect in this direction, it\r\nis quite possible that an increase of pressure may actually lower the\r\nmelting-points, and cause one or other mineral to remain in solution\r\nin the magma. It is not clear how pressure can affect the size of any\r\nconstituent, except by bringing about conditions under which it can go\r\non growing, while other constituents remain in solution, or do not grow\r\nso fast.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions may arise from the aid given by pressure to\r\nthe retention of what French geologists have called _agents\r\nminéralisateurs_. Several familiar minerals, for instance albite,\r\northoclase, and quartz, require the presence of water for their\r\nformation. Volatile substances, not utilised in the ultimate product,\r\nno doubt similarly assist the formation of many rock-forming minerals.\r\nOccasionally, moreover, as in the development of the micas and certain\r\nof the silicates known as zeolites, some proportion of hydrogen is\r\nretained by minerals thus crystallising from the magma. Micas appear\r\nto require the presence of fluorine for their development. J. P.\r\nIddings[61], however, lays stress in this case on the chemical activity\r\nof hydrogen at high temperatures.\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks, unless cooled with singular rapidity, thus contain\r\ncrystals of various kinds. In lavas, these may form the globular\r\naggregates known as _spherulites_[62], or may accumulate as a compact\r\nground of minute grains and needles, not quite resolvable with the\r\nmicroscope. In many rocks of slightly coarser grain, a compact\r\n_lithoidal_ or stony texture is set up, which the microscope resolves\r\ninto an aggregate of crystalline rods or granules. Such compact rocks\r\nare often styled _felsitic_. In other types, as in ordinary granite,\r\nthe constituent minerals are easily distinguished with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThe order in which these constituents have developed is sometimes clear\r\nfrom the inclusion of one mineral in another. When two substances\r\nare dissolved in one another, there is a certain proportion between\r\nthem, varying with the substances, which allows them to crystallise at\r\nthe same time, instead of in succession. This _eutectic proportion_,\r\nwhen attained by two mineral substances in a magma, brings about a\r\ncomplete interlocking of their crystals, as is seen in the quartz and\r\nalkali-felspar of the rock known as \"graphic granite.\" The order of\r\ncrystallisation of minerals from an ordinary non-eutectic magma is\r\nprofoundly affected by the proportions in which their constituents are\r\npresent in the mass.\r\n\r\nThe minerals, when they have separated out, are found to be mostly\r\nsilicates. A few oxides, such as rutile, magnetite, and ilmenite,\r\nmay occur, the two latter being especially common where iron is an\r\nimportant constituent of the rock. But almost all igneous rocks consist\r\nlargely of one or more species of felspar, silica being here combined\r\nwith alumina, potash, soda, and lime. Free silica may remain, and\r\nseparates as quartz, or rarely as tridymite. Pale mica occurs in many\r\nrocks of deep-seated origin. In contrast with these light-coloured\r\nminerals, iron, magnesium, and part of the calcium, appear in another\r\nseries of silicates, usually dark in colour, and this series may\r\nbe broadly styled \"ferromagnesian.\" The pyroxenes, of which augite\r\nis the type, the amphiboles, of which hornblende is the type, dark\r\nmica (mostly biotite), and olivine, are the ordinary ferromagnesian\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nBroadly, then, igneous rocks divide themselves by texture into (i)\r\nthose which are completely crystalline, and in which the minerals are\r\ndistinctly visible; (ii) those which are completely crystalline, but in\r\nwhich the crystals are so small as to give rise to a compact lithoidal\r\nground-mass; and (iii) those in which some glass is present. The third\r\ngroup may appear lithoidal, or in other cases actually glassy, to the\r\nunaided eye.\r\n\r\nThis mode of division is justified from a natural history point of\r\nview. The first group includes rocks that have consolidated slowly\r\nunderground. The second includes rocks cooled more quickly, on the\r\nmargins of magma-basins, or as offshoots from them, filling cracks in\r\nthe surrounding rocks, and producing wall-like masses known as _dykes_.\r\nThe third group appears mostly in dykes and lava-flows.\r\n\r\nWhere a dyke has intruded among heated rocks and undergoes no sudden\r\nchilling, it may become coarsely crystalline, even though comparatively\r\nsmall. Some dykes exhibit a chilled margin of glass along their\r\nbounding surfaces, and are none the less completely crystalline at\r\nthe centre, where cooling has been slow. No structure is peculiar to\r\ndyke-rocks, nor can a class be established for such rocks on chemical\r\nor mineralogical grounds, even though a few special types of igneous\r\nrock may at present be known only among these minor intrusive bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Side of a Volcanic Cone. Ash-layer of 1906 on\r\nthe west flank of Vesuvius. Cliffs of the exploded crater of Monte\r\nSomma behind.]\r\n\r\nThe fine-grained layers of _volcanic dust_, commonly spoken of as\r\n_ash_, and the coarser _tuffs_, in which lumps of scoriaceous lava are\r\nclearly visible, bridge the gap between sedimentary and igneous rocks.\r\nThe dust, during a great eruption, is distributed by wind over hundreds\r\nof square miles of country. The tuffs, deposited nearer the orifice of\r\nthe volcano, vary in coarseness from day to day, and exhibit marked\r\nstratification. Ash-beds and tuffs may be laid out in lakes or in the\r\nsea, and their layers may then include organic remains. Waves may round\r\ntheir particles on the shore, and may sift them till only a coarse\r\nvolcanic sand remains.\r\n\r\nAfter an eruption, the newly deposited ash and tuff usually form\r\nobvious layers on the surface of the country. Landslips on the side\r\nof the volcanic cone may reveal sections of the new coating and of\r\npreviously stratified material (Fig. 14). In certain districts,\r\nsedimentary and other rocks torn off from below form a large part of\r\nthe fragmental deposits of volcanic action. The characteristic volcanic\r\ncone is itself due to the greater accumulation of tuffs and ashes near\r\nthe vent (Fig. 15).\r\n\r\nThe loose tuffs formed of scoriæ allow water to percolate easily\r\nthrough them, and a cone of fairly coarse material resists the weather\r\nwell. The remarkable freshness of the extinct \"cinder-cones\" of\r\nAuvergne was thus long ago explained by Lyell. Surfaces of ash, on the\r\nother hand, are easily washed down by rain in the form of dangerous\r\nmud-flows, which spread across the lowlands, and give rise to compact\r\nclays, shrinking as they dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Tuff-Cone with Tuff-Beds at the base. Puy de la\r\nVache, Puy-de-Dôme, France.]\r\n\r\n_Lava-flows_ are masses of molten rock that have welled out from the\r\nvent, without being torn to pieces by the explosion of the gases that\r\nthey contained. The rapidity of their flow depends on their chemical\r\ncomposition, on the amount of gases present, and on the temperature\r\nat which they are extruded. The more highly siliceous lavas, for a\r\ngiven temperature, are more viscous than those towards the basaltic\r\nend of the series, which contain only about 48 per cent. of silica. A\r\nlava of considerable fluidity will consolidate in somewhat thin sheets\r\nwith smooth and ropy surfaces. A less fluid type will become markedly\r\nscoriaceous, where the vapours endeavour to escape from it; the rugged\r\ncrust formed on its upper cooling surface will be broken up by the\r\ncontinued movement of the more liquid mass below, and the blocks thus\r\nformed may become rolled over the advancing front of the flow and\r\nentombed in the portion that has not yet consolidated.\r\n\r\nThe surface of ordinary lava-flows remains rough for centuries, and\r\nonly slowly crumbles down before weathering to form a soil. While\r\ntuff-beds provide light and fertile lands, the lava-streams remain\r\nmarked out among them, as sinuous bands of rock, given over to an\r\nirregular growth of woodland. By repeated outflows, lavas tend to fill\r\nup the interspaces between the earlier streams, just as these have\r\nfilled up the hollows in the country over which they spread. A uniform\r\nsurface thus arises, and _lava-plains_ eventually bury a varied land\r\nof hill and dale. Where a number of small vents have opened, perhaps\r\nalong parallel fissures in the earth, the flooding of the country with\r\nigneous rock may lead to an appearance of stratification in masses\r\nextending over hundreds of square miles. Sections in the igneous\r\nseries, however, show that the individual flows dove-tail into and\r\noverlap one another, more rapidly than is the case with the lenticular\r\nmasses that constitute an ordinary sedimentary series.\r\n\r\nAfter the constituents of the lava have begun to crystallise, and when\r\nthe rock may be considered solid, cracks due to contraction are set up.\r\nThe upper part of the flow, radiating its heat and parting with its\r\ngases into the air above, solidifies comparatively rapidly, and cracks\r\narise without much regularity. Now and then, columnar structure, like\r\nthat of dried starch, appears on a small scale, the columns starting\r\nfrom various oblique surfaces of cooling, and lying in consequence in\r\nvarious directions in the rock.\r\n\r\nJ. P. Iddings shows that curvature of the columns will result if one\r\nportion of the surface loses heat more rapidly than another. As the\r\ncontraction-cracks bounding the columns spread inwards, the layer\r\nreached by them at any time in the lava will be farther in from a part\r\nof the surface where cooling is rapid than it will be from a part where\r\nit is slow. Hence the layer in the lava where contractional stresses\r\nare producing cracks, _i.e._ the layer reached at any time by the\r\ninner ends of the contraction-columns, will be a curved one, and its\r\ncurvature will increase as it occupies positions more and more removed\r\nfrom the surface of the lava-flow. The axes of the contraction-columns,\r\nas they spread, are perpendicular to this layer, and the columns will\r\nthus curve as their development proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe base of a massive lava-flow, however, cools under much more uniform\r\nconditions, and the columns, stretching upwards from the ground and\r\nproduced by slow contraction, give rise to the regular prismatic\r\nstructures long ago known as \"giants' causeways.\" The original Giant's\r\nCauseway in the county of Antrim is the lower part of a basaltic flow,\r\nexposed by denudation on the shore. Fingal's Cave in Staffa owes its\r\ntough compact roof to the preservation of that portion of the flow\r\nwhich cooled downwards from the upper surface. G. P. Scrope[63] long\r\nago observed this dual structure in columnar lavas.\r\n\r\nThe columns, or the more irregular joint-blocks that sometimes\r\nrepresent them, are often subdivided by further contraction into\r\nspheroids, the coats of which peel off, as the rock weathers, like\r\nthose of an onion. The curved cross-joints of massive columns, now\r\nconvex upwards, now concave, represent the same tendency towards\r\nglobular contraction.\r\n\r\nA lava-flow is sometimes divided into large rudely spheroidal masses,\r\nwhich fit into one another, and which show signs of more rapid cooling\r\non their surfaces. These were particularly observed on the mountains\r\nnear Mont Genèvre by Cole and Gregory[64], who compared the forms\r\nto \"pillows or soft cushions pressed upon and against one another.\"\r\nIt was suggested that these forms were produced by the seething of\r\nviscid lavas, masses being heaved up and falling over, and the outer\r\nlayers having time to cool in a glassy state before they were deformed\r\nby contact with others. This _pillow-structure_ has been widely\r\nrecognised, and J. J. H. Teall has remarked how often \"pillow-lavas\"\r\nare associated with radiolarian cherts. He regarded them, therefore,\r\nas of submarine origin. Sir A. Geikie[65], moreover, stated that the\r\nspheroidal sack-like structure was produced by the flow of such lavas\r\ninto water or watery silt. This acute suggestion has now been verified\r\nby Tempest Anderson[66], who has observed in Samoa the chilling of\r\nthe lobes of lava, as they are thrust off into the sea and washed\r\nover by the waves. H. Dewey and J. S. Flett[67] have pointed out that\r\npillow-structure commonly occurs in lavas in which there has been a\r\nconversion of lime soda felspars into albite, a change frequent in a\r\nseries of rocks which they call the \"spilitic suite.\" The importation\r\nof soda is attributed to vapours entering soon after the consolidation\r\nof the rock, and it is urged that any excess of sodium silicate\r\nmust have escaped into the sea-water in which the pillow-lavas\r\nwere produced. Hence radiolaria will flourish in the neighbourhood\r\n(presuming that a decomposition of the silicate can be brought about),\r\nand their remains will in time form flint in the hollows of the lavas.\r\nThe paper quoted contains numerous references to previous work, and is\r\na suggestive example of how petrographic study may go hand in hand with\r\nthe appreciation of rocks from a natural history point of view. It is\r\nonly characteristic of the subject of petrology that G. Steinmann[68]\r\nhas with equal ingenuity explained the relations between radiolaria\r\nand spilitic lavas by reminding us that gravity-determinations show\r\nan excess of basic material under the oceans and of lighter material,\r\nrich in silica, under continental land. Hence, when deep-sea deposits\r\nare crumpled by earth-movements, basic types of rock, graduating even\r\ninto serpentine, become associated with radiolarian chert, partly as\r\nextruded lavas, but usually as intrusive sheets injected at the epoch\r\nof mountain-building.\r\n\r\nThe characters of igneous rocks in _dykes_, that is, of those types\r\nthat have consolidated in fissures, resemble in many respects the\r\ncharacters of lava-flows. Chilling being usually equal on both\r\nsurfaces, glassy or compact types of rock occur on both sides, and\r\nthe dyke is, as previously observed, more crystalline in the centre.\r\nColumnar structures arise from both surfaces, the dyke also shrinking\r\nparallel to its margins. In the outer layers so formed, the columns\r\nare small, and they increase in diameter nearer the centre. In small\r\ndykes and veins, the columns may run continuously from side to side;\r\nin larger ones, they meet along a central surface, which forms, on\r\nweathering, a plane of weakness in the rock. Dykes may thus become worn\r\naway, decay spreading from the central region, and leaving the more\r\nresisting and more glassy portions clinging to the bounding walls.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, the surrounding rocks are more easily worn away than\r\nthe igneous invader, as very often happens, the dykes stand out on the\r\nsurface as great ribs and walls.\r\n\r\nThe rocks cooled in the deep-seated cauldrons, under what are styled\r\n_plutonic_ conditions, have parted with their gases so slowly that\r\nthey do not show scoriaceous structure. They may become very coarsely\r\ncrystalline, like many of the Scandinavian granites; minerals,\r\nmoreover, may be produced which are unstable or difficult to form\r\nnearer the surface. Crystals developed in plutonic surroundings become\r\ncarried forward when the partially consolidated mass is pressed up\r\nto a volcanic orifice, and may undergo resorption on the way. Many,\r\nhowever, escape, and impart a _porphyritic structure_ to lavas. The\r\ndeep-seated rock, from causes that promote the growth of one mineral\r\nand the retention of another in solution, may also become \"porphyritic\"\r\n_in situ_, smaller crystals, or even a eutectic intergrowth, finally\r\nfilling in the ground.\r\n\r\nThe viscidity of igneous rocks may cause any of the types to show a\r\n_fluidal structure_. Constituents already formed become dragged along\r\nin parallel series as the mass moves forward. Sometimes a group of\r\nspherulites, or a knot of \"felsitic\" matter caused by the dense growth\r\nof embryo-crystals, is stretched out into a sheet, and on fractured\r\nsurfaces a _banded structure_ characterises the mass. These banded\r\nrocks record, in their crumpled and obviously fluidal layers, the\r\nformerly molten condition of the mass. Even completely crystalline\r\nrocks may show parallel arrangement of their minerals, owing to flow\r\nduring the last stages of consolidation, or to pressure from the walls\r\nof the cauldron, influencing the positions taken up by crystals that\r\npossess a rod-like or platy form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Granite invading Mica-Schist. Clifton, near\r\nCape Town. Adjacent sections were studied by Charles Darwin (see p.\r\n156).]\r\n\r\nThe conspicuously banded structures in some crystalline rocks that\r\nare often grouped with the metamorphic gneisses may, however, be best\r\nexplained by their composite origin, and the history of the structure\r\nis easily determinable in the field. A common case arises where a\r\ngranite magma, perhaps already bearing crystals, is intruded, under\r\npressure operating from a distance, into a well-bedded series of\r\nsedimentary rocks. The sediments open up like the leaves of a book and\r\nadmit the invader along their planes of stratification. Even limestone\r\nmay thus become interlaminated with an igneous rock, just as basalt\r\nhas been known to separate the annual rings of trees involved in it.\r\nThis intimate admixture permits of extensive mineral changes, and the\r\ntwo types of rock, probably very different in geological age, become\r\nwelded together into a _composite gneiss_, both members of which have\r\ninfluenced one another by contact-metamorphism, often across a wide\r\nstretch of country (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\nIntrusive igneous rocks in the field will, however, ordinarily prove\r\ntheir character by cutting somewhere across the prevalent structure of\r\nthe district. When the materials that elsewhere form dykes penetrate\r\nbetween strata for considerable distances as _intrusive sheets_,\r\nthey may yet be traced to some point where they have made use of a\r\ncrack across the bedding. The necks or plugs of old volcanic centres\r\nsometimes seem to occupy orifices drilled, or rather shattered, by\r\nexplosion right through the overlying obstacles. The approximately\r\ncircular necks in South Africa, filled by brecciated masses of\r\nserpentinous rock, are notable examples. The underground cauldrons\r\nthemselves, when brought to light by denudation, are represented by\r\nregions of crystalline rock, which may have various relations to their\r\nsurroundings. We may trace, in every case, upon their margins the\r\nramifying veins that first proved to James Hutton that granite was\r\nyounger than the rocks among which it lay. But the portion exposed may\r\nbe merely the top of a huge body or _batholite_ of igneous matter,\r\nstretching far down into the crust; or it may be part of a localised\r\nknot, which filled up some cavity provided for it by earth-movement,\r\noozing in step by step as room was made for its advance. In the latter\r\ncase, it was originally bounded above by some series of strata which\r\nwas arched up as a dome or as an anticline. Or possibly strata have\r\nbeen moved apart from one another, the upper ones sliding over the\r\nlower ones and at the same time bulging upwards, so as to leave a\r\ncavity of roughly hemispherical form. Such a space, allowing relief\r\nfrom pressure, will be occupied by igneous rock, which may or may not\r\nhave a direct root through the stratum underneath it. The igneous mass\r\nmay in such cases be merely an expansion of a large intrusive sheet. It\r\nsends off veins into the roof above, and can only be distinguished from\r\na batholite by the presence of stratified rock beneath it. Occurrences\r\nof this kind were first described in the Henry Mountains of Utah by G.\r\nK. Gilbert, who gave them the name of \"stone-cisterns\" or _laccoliths_,\r\na word now commonly written _laccolites_. It may be questioned if the\r\nexpansion of the gases in the intruding igneous rock is sufficient in\r\nitself to form the laccolitic dome. The igneous rock has probably been\r\npressed into position by the forces that produced the earth-movements.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, batholites seem to have worked their way upwards\r\nwithout any relation to earth-movements in the district. The processes\r\nby which they come into place among other rocks are worthy of separate\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTRUSION OF LARGE BODIES OF IGNEOUS ROCK\r\n\r\nAttention has been already called to the composite gneisses formed by\r\nthe intrusion of an igneous magma between the leaves, as it were, of\r\nsediments. Such occurrences are often seen on the margins of batholites\r\nor of any kind of igneous dome, and they no doubt represent the picking\r\noff of layer after layer from the walls surrounding the intrusive mass.\r\nIf these layers can become absorbed into the igneous rock, the crest\r\nof the dome can advance, and the dome itself can widen, so long as\r\nsufficient heat is supplied to it from below. Space is found for the\r\nintrusive mass at the expense of the marginal rocks; but it is obvious\r\nthat the portions absorbed merely add to the bulk of the igneous\r\nmaterial. The composition of the latter must also undergo modification.\r\nIts great size, reaching as it does far down into the crust, in\r\ncomparison with the quantity of matter absorbed in the upper regions,\r\nmay render such modification very difficult to trace beyond the latest\r\nzone of contact.\r\n\r\nPetrologists differ very widely as to the extent to which igneous\r\nmasses assume their place in the upper regions of the crust by\r\nprocesses of \"stoping,\" absorption, and assimilation. The statement,\r\nhowever, in a recent work that \"the assimilation hypothesis\" is \"still\r\nsupported by some French geologists\" is calculated to surprise those\r\nwho recognise the trend of modern opinion both in America and on the\r\ncontinent of Europe. Far from the views of A. Michel Lévy, C. Barrois,\r\nand A. Lacroix, surviving as an expression of national perversity,\r\nthey have been supported to a remarkable degree by the observations of\r\nSederholm in Finland, of Lepsius and H. Credner in Saxony, of A. Lawson\r\nand F. D. Adams in North America, and by the careful reasoning of C.\r\nDoelter[69] based largely on his own experimental work. A. Harker[70]\r\nand J. P. Iddings[71] have argued that assimilation is merely a local\r\nphenomenon, of little importance in the theory of igneous intrusion. W.\r\nC. Brögger[72], however, who strongly supports the laccolitic view for\r\nthe Christiania district, expresses himself with far more caution, and\r\nleaves the way clear for conclusions as to absorption and mingling of\r\nmolten products in the _lower regions_ of the crust.\r\n\r\nDoelter lays stress on the influence of high temperature, and\r\nespecially of the highly heated gases in the igneous rock, in promoting\r\ncorrosion of the cauldron-walls. He attributes greater power of\r\ncorrosion to the magmas rich in silica, and agrees with R. A. Daly\r\nthat the rapidly moving basic magmas reach the upper layers of the\r\ncrust in a condition of comparative purity. Daly[73] may be looked\r\non as an extremist in this matter; but it is hard for those who have\r\nstudied regions where the deep-seated cauldrons have been cut across\r\nby denudation to avoid very large views of igneous absorption. The\r\ncontact-zones between the igneous mass and the surrounding rocks are\r\noften seen merely in cross-section on the flanks of a batholite or\r\nlaccolite. In the areas of Archæan rocks, on the other hand, where\r\nprolonged denudation has exposed the zones of repeated interaction over\r\nhundreds of square miles on an approximately horizontal surface, one\r\nmay form some idea of the processes that are still effective in the\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nG. V. Hawes[74], in 1881, recognised the importance of the process\r\nknown by the mining term of \"stoping,\" as a means whereby igneous rocks\r\nwork their way upward in the crust. Cracks in the overlying roof are\r\nentered by the magma, blocks are wedged off, and these are ultimately\r\nabsorbed in the molten mass. In this matter Hawes stands as a pioneer.\r\nAs the viscosity of the magma increases during cooling, the blocks\r\nlast detached may remain embedded in the marginal zone. The remarkable\r\npurity of this zone, however, in many cases has raised an obvious\r\ndifficulty; but it has been pointed out[75] that the modified marginal\r\nand composite rock may continuously sink down into the depths, aided\r\nby any of the causes that promote magmatic differentiation, while a\r\nfairly pure magma, almost of the original composition, is left on the\r\ncrest of the advancing dome. R. A. Daly[76] has developed the stoping\r\ntheory with considerable boldness. The areas most likely to carry\r\nconviction to those who doubt that igneous masses can be intruded at\r\nthe expense of their surroundings are those where banded gneisses have\r\narisen on a regional scale (see p. 160).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RANGE OF COMPOSITION IN IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\nThe broad division of igneous rocks into those of light colour and\r\nof low specific gravity on the one hand and those that are dark and\r\nheavy on the other is a very natural one, and Bunsen and Durocher\r\ninsisted that two magmas were fundamental in the crust. In one of\r\nthese, the \"acid\" magma, which gives rise to granites and rhyolites,\r\nsilica formed about 70 per cent. by weight of the ultimate rocks; in\r\nthe other, it formed about 50 per cent., and the products are basic\r\ndiorites, gabbros, and basalts[77]. The former group of rocks is rich\r\nin alkalies, the latter, the \"basic\" group, in calcium, magnesium, and\r\niron. The mixture of these more extreme types of magma was held to give\r\nrise to what are now called \"intermediate\" rocks.\r\n\r\nTwo other views are of course possible. If the composition of the\r\nglobe was originally uniform, the two magmas must have arisen by\r\nseparation from one of intermediate nature. Hence, in any cauldron in\r\nthe crust, in place of one of two magmas, an intermediate magma may\r\nbe presumed to exist, and to split up, from various causes, into a\r\nnumber of parts which are separately erupted at the surface. Charles\r\nDarwin's[78] remarks as to the sinking of crystals in a cooling magma,\r\nand the consequent production of a trachytic and basaltic type in\r\nthe same cauldron, led the way to a general acceptance of the theory\r\nof _magmatic differentiation_ in laccolites and batholites. W. C.\r\nBrögger's[79] brilliant explanation of the variation and succession of\r\ntypes of igneous rock in the Christiania district has had a profound\r\ninfluence on workers in other fields, and has perhaps directed\r\nattention away from the parallel possibilities of differentiation by\r\nassimilation.\r\n\r\nThe _assimilation theory_ provides the second possible view above\r\nreferred to. A magma may be modified by the rocks into which it\r\nintrudes, so that a \"basic\" fluid may become charged with silica from\r\na sandstone, the product crystallising as a granite; while an \"acid\"\r\nfluid may become so charged with limestone that diorite ultimately\r\nresults. A. Harker[80] has discussed both theories clearly, with a\r\nstrong leaning to the acceptance of magmatic differentiation in the\r\ncauldron as the only important cause of variation. R. A. Daly, on the\r\nother hand, goes at least as far as Lacroix in France in supporting\r\nthe theory of assimilation. For him, the primitive igneous magma is\r\nalready basic, and basalts are therefore the prevalent type of igneous\r\nrock. They reach us, moreover, from considerable depths. The acid\r\nrocks are formed by amalgamation of this magma with siliceous material\r\nlying nearer the earth's surface. Igneous rocks exceptionally rich in\r\nalkalies, the so-called \"alkaline\" series, result from the absorption\r\nof limestone in the magma; denser lime-bearing silicates are thus\r\nformed, which sink by gravitation, leaving a lighter magma above in\r\nwhich soda has become concentrated. Carbon dioxide liberated from the\r\nlimestone also plays a part in carrying up the alkalies that might\r\notherwise remain in a lower portion[81].\r\n\r\nE. H. L. Schwarz[82] extends Daly's views with an almost romantic\r\nfulness. He holds, with Chamberlin, that the primitive globe resulted\r\nfrom the aggregation of basic meteoritic material. The more siliceous\r\ncrust arose from the withdrawal of magnesium and iron into the depths\r\nby long-continued processes of leaching and gravitation. The melting of\r\nthis crust produces the acid igneous rocks. Igneous cauldrons originate\r\nin the heat due to faulting, or to crumpling, or even to the impact\r\nof gigantic meteorites. When a molten magma is locally established,\r\nvariation occurs in it by assimilation of different types of material\r\nround it.\r\n\r\nThe balance of judgment as to differentiation and assimilation, which\r\nshould be regarded as parallel probabilities rather than as rival\r\npropositions, is admirably held by C. Doelter[83], whose chapters on\r\nthis matter can be appreciated by all geologists.\r\n\r\nIt is of course possible that differentiation of type, from various\r\ncauses, has already proceeded so far in the earth's crust as to produce\r\nnoteworthy contrasts in the rocks erupted in different areas. The\r\ninterior of our globe, on Chamberlin's planetesimal hypothesis, need\r\nnot have been uniform in constitution, either at the outset or at any\r\nsubsequent time. J. W. Judd[84] has called attention to the existence\r\nof _petrographical provinces_, a conception that has been very fruitful\r\nin results. These provinces have been grouped by Harker[85] in two\r\nbranches, characterised respectively by rocks rich in alkalies and by\r\nrocks rich in lime. The former branch appears to be associated with the\r\nmovements of faulting and block-structure, rather than of crumpling,\r\nthat have produced E. Suess's \"Atlantic\" type of coast. The rocks rich\r\nin lime, on the other hand, are said to be characteristic of areas\r\nthat have been folded like the countries bordering the Pacific. The\r\nnames \"Atlantic\" and \"Pacific\" have consequently been given to the two\r\nbranches, but these terms seem too geographical in their suggestion.\r\nDewey and Flett[86] have put forward a third type of magma, giving\r\nrise especially to albite as a primary or secondary constituent, and\r\ncharacterised by the production of pillow-lavas. This type is held to\r\nbe associated with areas that have steadily subsided, without much\r\nfolding. G. Steinmann[87], however, has connected the spilites and\r\n\"ophiolitic\" rocks with regions of intense over-folding.\r\n\r\nSo far, there are many cases where it is difficult to assign a\r\npetrographic province to one or other of these branches, and the system\r\nseems to demand more simplicity within the provinces than nature is\r\nprepared to yield.\r\n\r\nWhatever the causes of variation, it is necessary to mark out by names\r\ncertain kinds of igneous material, and it is generally accepted that\r\nthe types thus set up are best based on chemical composition. At the\r\nsame time, the minerals present in the rock, and also its structure,\r\nrecord certain phases of its history, and deserve an important place in\r\nany system of classification. The natural history of an igneous rock\r\nis concerned with its mode of occurrence, and no isolated specimen can\r\nsatisfy the geological investigator. In the field, the porphyritic\r\ncrystals, which have an important influence on the total chemical\r\ncomposition, may be found to be strangers to the magma, and to have\r\nbeen derived from some mass imperfectly absorbed. The dark flecks and\r\npatches in a granitoid rock, so often ascribed, somewhat mysteriously,\r\nto local \"segregation\" in the magma, again and again prove to be\r\nmetamorphosed and minutely injected fragments of foreign rocks[88].\r\n\r\nNone the less, a broad classification is possible on chemical grounds,\r\nand the _acid_, _intermediate_, _basic_, and _ultrabasic_ grouping\r\nadopted by Judd has been found of great convenience. Among acid rocks\r\nwe have _granite_ as the coarsely crystalline type, with potassium\r\nfelspars prevalent and the excess of silica manifest as quartz.\r\nThe finer grained and sometimes compact types are the _eurites_,\r\n_quartz-felsites_, or _quartz-porphyries_. When the rock contains more\r\nor less residual glass, we have what are now known as _rhyolites_, of\r\nwhich ordinary _obsidian_ is the most glassy representative.\r\n\r\nThe opposite types, those of the basic group, include, at the coarsely\r\ncrystalline end, _gabbro_ and _basic diorite_; the finely crystalline\r\nforms are styled _dolerites_, and those with a trace of glass, or at\r\nany rate very fine-grained and compact, are _basalts_. Glassy types\r\nare naturally rare in this group, owing to the unsuitable chemical\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nBetween granite and gabbro lie various rocks of intermediate\r\ncomposition, some of them rich in soda rather than in potash.\r\n_Syenite_, _granodiorite_, and the diorites with a prevalence of soda\r\nover lime, are coarsely crystalline types. Compact types of these of\r\ncourse occur. It will be sufficient, however, here to name the forms\r\nwith traces of residual glass, which range from _trachyte_, the type\r\nrich in potash, to _andesite_, which connects them with basalt, in a\r\nseries where lime ultimately predominates over soda.\r\n\r\nIn the ultrabasic group are a number of exceptional types. Olivine\r\noften becomes an important constituent, and the rocks then decompose\r\ninto the soft green or reddish masses known as _serpentine_--or, more\r\nproperly, _serpentine-rock_.\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks, owing to their range of mineral composition and of\r\nstructure, combined with their general hardness, lend themselves to\r\nvarious economic purposes. While the granites, resisting atmospheric\r\nattack admirably in a polished state, provide our handsomest\r\nbuilding-stones, dolerites and fine-grained diorites, which owe their\r\ntoughness largely to the interlocked relations of their constituent\r\nminerals, serve as our most satisfactory road-metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENERY OF IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\nVolcanic landscapes, where activity is very recent or still in\r\nprogress, present a number of characteristic surface-forms. The cones\r\nthat have accumulated round the vents surpass all other hills in\r\nregularity of outline, and the crater in the summit is often relatively\r\nlarge. Lava-cones may be steep-sided bosses when formed of protrusions\r\nof viscid rocks rich in silica, like the remarkable domes in the north\r\nof Bohemia, or they may present very gentle slopes where fluid basic\r\nlavas have been extruded.\r\n\r\nTuff-cones are liable to be breached on one side, owing to the outflow\r\nof lava which the crater-wall could not sustain, and they then assume\r\nthe form of a mountain in which glacial influences have hollowed out a\r\ncirque.\r\n\r\nRain washes down the loose materials from great volcanic cones, and\r\nemphasises the concave curve of the mountain sides, the form that is\r\nso beautiful in Fuji-yama in Japan, and which Hokusai, with pardonable\r\nand affectionate exaggeration, reproduced in a hundred illustrations.\r\nUltimately, however, grooves appear on the flanks of the cone, in which\r\npermanent streams gather, and the slopes are dissected and worn away.\r\nDuring this process, the tuffs yield steep and fantastic forms, and\r\nwall-like dykes weather out among them. The dykes are usually the last\r\nfeatures to decay.\r\n\r\nWhere the vent has been plugged with lava at the close of its activity,\r\nthe _neck_ of rock often remains standing above the surrounding\r\ncountry. The site of cone after cone can be picked out in this way\r\nin the Cainozoic volcanic areas of central Germany. The jutting crag\r\nof trachyte or of basalt has often been seized on as the site of a\r\nfeudal castle, under which the dependent agriculturists still gather at\r\nnightfall in their red-roofed town. The group of sheer-sided necks in\r\nthe Hegau in southern Württemberg, the Hohentwiel, Hohenkrähen, and the\r\nrest, form a very striking landscape amid undulating Cainozoic lands.\r\n\r\nThe lava-beds that cover wide areas are naturally of basic composition.\r\nBasalts thus form enormous plains with rugged surfaces, on which at\r\nlast a red-brown soil collects. When exposed to denudation from the\r\nedge of the region inwards, they develop a marked terrace-structure,\r\nthrough which the rivers cut steep and grim ravines. Grass may grow\r\non the ledges and the tables; but the scarps, controlled by the\r\nwell-marked vertical jointing of the lavas, remain sharp and prominent,\r\nand the rock falls away from these walls in whole columns at a time.\r\nThis structure is characteristically seen in northern Mull and the\r\nadjacent smaller isles, and is still more impressive from the centre\r\nto the north of Skye, where the rain swept terraces covered by grass\r\nand bog and scanty oatfields, and the black steps of rock between them,\r\npresent a scene of strange monotony and desolation.\r\n\r\nIn regions less exposed to stormy weather, the lava-plateaus may\r\nprovide good soils. For instance, after the great seaward scarp of the\r\nbasalts has been crossed in the counties of Antrim and of Londonderry,\r\nthe lava-fields, dropped by faults towards Lough Neagh, are seen to\r\nbe occupied by prosperous farms. In arid countries, however, the\r\nsavage surface of the flows merely becomes modified by red dust and\r\nscoriaceous gravel, worn by wind and changes of temperature from the\r\nupstanding portions of the land.\r\n\r\nWhere a stratified country has been freely invaded by sheets of lava\r\nalong its planes of bedding, the stratification is emphasised in any\r\npart exposed to weathering. The resisting igneous rock stands out in\r\nscarps along the hills, and marks out any folds that have been formed\r\nsince the epoch of its intrusion.\r\n\r\nWhen the beds remain fairly level, and are also uplifted, flat-topped\r\nhills are formed by the intrusive sheets, like those that may be carved\r\nout of a country flooded over by lava-streams. The crystalline rock,\r\nvery probably a dolerite, protects what lies below it. The kopjes north\r\nof the Great Karroo in the centre of the Cape of Good Hope are thus\r\nlevel on the crest and bounded by a steep wall or _krans_ of rock.\r\n\r\nThe edges of similar \"sills\" of igneous rock have controlled much of\r\nthe scenery between the Highland border of Scotland and the Tyne. A\r\nfine example is the indented scarp of the Great Whin Sill, a sheet of\r\ndolerite intruded among the Carboniferous strata of Northumberland.\r\nThis mass forms a platform for Bamburgh Castle against the wild North\r\nSea, and is traceable south-westward across the country towards\r\nCarlisle. North of Hexham, its escarpment is occupied by Hadrian's\r\nwall, and the town of Borcovicus was planted on the edge, overlooking\r\nall Northumbria.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of North Britain and Ireland have long known upstanding\r\nigneous dykes as unprofitable \"whinstones.\" The regularity of direction\r\namong dykes over very wide areas points to their intrusion along cracks\r\nproduced by stretching of the crust. Radial grouping of dykes, such as\r\none finds near volcanic necks, or, on a gigantic scale, round Tycho on\r\nthe moon, may be due to explosive action; but the majority of dykes\r\nseem to have followed upon earth-movement. In the north of Ireland,\r\nfrom the coast of Down to that of Donegal, a series of compact rocks of\r\nDevonian age occurs in dykes lying almost invariably north and south.\r\nThe post-Cretaceous dykes of the same region have a still more uniform\r\ntrend, from north-west to south-east. Such series of dykes modify the\r\nscenery of coasts by forming promontories and serviceable piers for\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nThe offshoots near the surface of a great intrusive mass are far less\r\nregular. We are here close to the zone of attack, the \"shatter-zone,\"\r\nand the structures or regular fracture-planes of the overlying rock\r\nonly partially control the position taken up by the intrusive magma.\r\nIrregular knots and bosses appear in place of far-spreading sheets, and\r\na network of crossing veins occurs, instead of a system of coordinated\r\ndykes. The resulting country is hummocky and broken, and, where the\r\ncauldron itself has become exposed, striking contrasts of surface are\r\nseen as we pass from the igneous core to the older and frequently\r\nstratified rocks upon its flanks.\r\n\r\nSome large bodies of intrusive rock have, however, been formed\r\nsheet by sheet, and a bedded sill-like structure is then revealed\r\nin them on weathering. Sir A. Geikie[89] calls attention to this\r\nin his description of the heart of the black gabbro mass in Skye.\r\nBut, as a rule, the continuity of structure in batholites, and their\r\ncharacteristic joint-planes set at angles to one another, cause them to\r\nappear as massive blocks in the landscape, untraversed by any regular\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nGranite, with its broad tabular jointing, which is often developed\r\nparallel to a surface of cooling, forms rounded slopes and domes\r\nafter long-continued weathering. When reared high into the zone\r\nof frost-action, it develops spires and pinnacles, as in the huge\r\n\"aiguilles\" of Mont Blanc. But, as decay goes on, the uniform descent\r\nof boulders and sand forms spreading taluses, banked against the\r\nlower slopes, while the curving joints, not too closely set, promote\r\na smoothness on the higher lands. These joints, moreover, divide the\r\nrock into boulders almost ready-made. Tabular structure sometimes\r\npredominates; but even in this case the exposed ends of the layers soon\r\nbecome rounded, as the felspar crystals pass into a powdery state.\r\nCommonly, a rough spheroidal structure prevails, as may be traced in\r\nmany of the Dartmoor \"tors,\" and the blocks that slip away through\r\nwidening of the joints become more and more rounded as their surfaces\r\ncrumble on the talus (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Weathering Granite. Lundy Island.]\r\n\r\nIn tropical lands, granite exfoliates under the alternations of clear\r\nhot days and clear cold nights, and the joint-structure allows of the\r\nformation of great round-backed surfaces, on which spheroidal boulders\r\nappear poised. These boulders are the relics of an overlying layer\r\nof granite, most of which has slipped away to the hill-foot. Their\r\nsurfaces crumble, owing to the unequal expansion of the constituent\r\nminerals. When the rainy season sets in, the decomposed crust is washed\r\naway; during the dry season it falls off in flakes and powder. In\r\nthis way the magnificent series of monoliths that surround the grave\r\nof Cecil Rhodes in the Matopo Hills have become separated out from a\r\ncontinuous sheet of granite. They stand now like glacial boulders on\r\na surface almost as smooth as that of a _roche moutonnée_ (Fig. 18).\r\nThe landscape for miles around is fantastic with huge fallen masses,\r\nand with high-perched blocks that seem about to fall. Similar scenery\r\nis well known in central India, and exfoliation controls the form\r\nof mountain-domes in California and Brazil. J. C. Branner[90] lays\r\nmost stress on temperature-changes in the surface-zone, and little\r\non original spheroidal jointing, in promoting the exfoliation of the\r\nrounded boulders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Granite weathering under tropical conditions.\r\nRhodes's Grave, Matopo Hills, S. Rhodesia. The blocks like boulders are\r\nresidues of a sheet of granite that once overlay the hill.]\r\n\r\nThe basic rocks present far more rugged outlines. When a cauldron\r\noccupied by basic diorite or by gabbro comes under denuding action, the\r\nnumerous crossing joints oppose the formation of domes or tables. The\r\nweather widens one groove here, another there; the rock breaks away\r\nin angular fragments rather than as a powder over a broad surface,\r\nand serrated edges and jagged pinnacles arise along the crests. The\r\ndiorites among our old metamorphic rocks in Scotland or in Ireland can\r\nbe recognised on the sky-line at considerable distances. Sir A. Geikie,\r\nin his \"Scenery of Scotland,\" has made the contrast between granite and\r\ngabbro in the centre of the Isle of Skye familiar to all geologists.\r\nHere the two types of rock were erupted at no long interval, and\r\nthey have been exposed to denudation under the same conditions. J.\r\nMacculloch dwelt in 1819[91] on the relative resistance of the gabbro\r\nand the rapid disintegration of the granite hills, quaintly remarking\r\nof the latter that \"the loose stones, by their constant descent from\r\nthe summits, obscure the rocky surface, covering the sides with long\r\ntorrents of red rubbish even more unpleasing to the sight than their\r\nconoidal forms.\" Macculloch noted that the loose blocks in the gabbro\r\nregion lay much as they had fallen, without the production of a sand.\r\n\r\nIn most mountain-chains produced by folding, igneous matter has been\r\nforced up as an accompaniment of the earth-movements. The local knots\r\nand laccolites, or the great cores admitted along certain anticlines,\r\nstand out on weathering among schistose or stratified hills. Their\r\nsurfaces are marked by accidents, and each peak as it comes into\r\nview offers something of a new surprise. The wall of Mont Blanc from\r\nthe angle near Entrèves, and the huge crag of the Matterhorn above\r\nthe valley of the Visp, have illustrated to every traveller the\r\ndominance of igneous masses in the landscape. In our own islands, the\r\ngranites of Ben Cruachan and Cairn Gorm have resisted long ages of\r\ndenudation; an intrusive sheet of finer grain forms the long sheer\r\nwall of Cader Idris; while obsidian lava-flows, now grey and dull and\r\ncrystalline, have furnished on Snowdon the finest scenery of Wales. The\r\nfortress-town of Edinburgh has arisen on the relics of a dead volcano;\r\nand the high moor of Leinster, so long the peril of the English,\r\nrecords an igneous cauldron that has been exposed to denudation from\r\nthe opening of Devonian times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHIC ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION[92]\r\n\r\nUnder the term \"metamorphism,\" considered philologically, any change\r\nmay be included that is undergone by rocks after their original\r\ndeposition. Van Hise, in his monumental treatise, covers processes\r\nof cementation and alteration by percolating waters, as well as those\r\nlarger changes that accompany earth-movement and the transference of\r\nrocks into regions of igneous activity. It is, indeed, impossible to\r\ndraw any just line in this matter; but there is a general agreement\r\nthat \"metamorphic rocks\" are those that have been altered by heat or\r\npressure or both, either on a local or a regional scale, with the\r\nresult that new structures, or new minerals, or both, have arisen\r\nin the mass. The efficacy of heat alone or of pressure alone, of\r\n_contact-metamorphism_ or of _dynamo-metamorphism_, in producing\r\nconsiderable changes has been much debated. Some of the thermal\r\nchanges have been already referred to in the chapter on igneous rocks.\r\nWhile, moreover, the new structures and the development of mica in\r\nordinary slate bring it into the metamorphic group, we have found it\r\nconvenient to describe the slates in connexion with common clays. The\r\nrocks now to be dealt with give evidence of more extreme changes, and\r\nthe crystalline character of their constituents is appreciable by the\r\nunaided eye. For the most part, then, this chapter treats of _gneisses_\r\nand _schists_. The wider use of the terms _schiste_ and _schiefer_ on\r\nthe continent of Europe makes it necessary in most countries to style\r\nthe metamorphic forms \"crystalline schists.\"\r\n\r\nOver wide areas of certain countries, and sometimes when we approach\r\nthe localised cores of mountain-chains, the rocks show a parallel\r\narrangement of their constituents, reminding us of sediments; but their\r\nconstituents are all crystalline, and they are more interlocked with\r\none another than is the case in ordinary strata.\r\n\r\nSuch rocks have long been said to be \"foliated.\" The term was used by\r\nG. P. Scrope as far back as 1825; but this author, in common with most\r\ngeologists of his day, regarded the mineral folia as resulting from\r\nsedimentation. D'Aubuisson de Voisins[93] had already referred the\r\nparallelism of the _feuillets_ of mica in schists to some cause acting\r\non them during the consolidation of the rock from a plastic state; but\r\nit was left for Charles Darwin[94], in his remarkable observations\r\non metamorphic rocks in 1846, to separate clearly _foliation_ from\r\nstratification.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of metamorphism, we have to bear in mind that the\r\nalteration may be both chemical and physical. Substances may have been\r\nremoved from the rock, others may have been imported. The crystalline\r\nconstituents that are now present do not necessarily result from the\r\ncrystallisation of the original materials of the rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICA AND HORNBLENDE SCHISTS\r\n\r\n_Schists_ are the ordinary foliated rocks of fine or medium grain. The\r\nfolia are really flattened lenticular mineral aggregates, often bent\r\nand waved, lying on and against one another, with their platy surfaces\r\nin parallel planes. They result (i) from the deformation under pressure\r\nof objects already present in the rock, such as pebbles or crystals; or\r\n(ii) from the development of minerals under pressure during the process\r\nof metamorphism, such minerals being allowed greater facilities for\r\ngrowth in directions perpendicular to that from which the pressure is\r\nexerted; or (iii) from the development of minerals, notably mica, along\r\nthe planes of weakness provided by stratification or by cleavage.\r\n\r\nThe trend of foliation-planes across a country is often, as Darwin\r\npointed out, remarkably regular; in some cases, it follows that of\r\nthe stratification, in others that of cleavage. The wrinkling of the\r\nfoliation must be ascribed to subsequent compression, and all the\r\nfeatures seen in the \"strain-slip\" structure of slate (p. 92) are\r\nrepeated on a somewhat coarser scale in schists.\r\n\r\nSome schists are undoubtedly produced by the contact-metamorphism of\r\nshales. On the flanks of mountain-chains, where argillaceous rocks have\r\nbeen arched into domes, and where granite has intruded as a core, the\r\ncomplete passage can be traced from sediment to schist. The clay-rocks\r\nlend themselves readily to the production of mica, usually of the pale\r\ntype. Andalusite, and occasionally sillimanite and kyanite, arise.\r\nAndalusite often forms grey prisms of irregular outline, resembling\r\nslate-pencils, and standing out above the mica on any weathered\r\nsurface. Almandine garnet is almost always present. Quartz occurs in\r\nstreaks and patches, which resolve themselves into granular aggregates\r\non microscopic examination. The mica imparts a distinct foliation to\r\nthe mass; but the original stratification is very often preserved, and\r\nthe minerals have developed along its planes. Small differences in\r\nthe constitution of the original strata give rise to different types\r\nof schist, interbedded with one another. Andalusite, for instance,\r\nmay occur only in certain argillaceous layers, while other layers are\r\nquartzose, through the presence of original sand. _Mica-schist_ is the\r\ncommonest type of metamorphic rock.\r\n\r\nWhere mineralisation has taken place over a wide area, it may be\r\ndifficult to say if the foliation-planes in a schist are those of\r\nbedding, or of superinduced cleavage, or whether they indicate a\r\nsliding movement in the mass under pressure, whereby all preceding\r\nstructures have become obliterated.\r\n\r\n_Amphibole-schist_, often styled _epidiorite_, consists of foliated\r\nhornblende, or its greener ally actinolite, associated with granular\r\nfelspar and sometimes with equally granular quartz. The amphibole\r\nbeing usually prismatic, the crystals are found with their longer axes\r\narranged in parallel planes, and often streaked out parallel to one\r\nanother. Minute wrinklings, due to subsequent yielding, are not so\r\nfrequent as in mica-schists. Amphibole-schists occur commonly as knots\r\nand somewhat irregular masses among mica-schists, and represent basic\r\nigneous rocks that were interbedded or intrusive in the sedimentary\r\nseries. The pyroxene of the original rock has become recrystallised as\r\nhornblende, and the felspathic constituent has rearranged itself in\r\ngranular forms. J. J. H. Teall[95] has described in interesting detail\r\nan example from the older rocks of Sutherland, and his paper contains a\r\nuseful discussion of problems of pressure-metamorphism.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHIBOLITES\r\n\r\nHornblende-schists are often seen to pass into true diorites; but\r\nthey also have relationships with the more puzzling rocks known as\r\n_amphibolites_. These, again, graduate into _pyroxenites_, or rocks\r\nrich in pyroxene, with granular quartz and triclinic felspar, and into\r\n_eclogites_, which may be defined as pyroxenites with garnet.\r\n\r\nPyroxene-eclogite, in South Africa, is associated with diamond[96], and\r\nfragments of exploded eclogite abound in the igneous vents from which\r\nthe diamonds are extracted.\r\n\r\nWhat has been called \"pyroxene-granulite\" is a dark granular eclogite,\r\nincluding rhombic pyroxene side by side with garnet, and associated,\r\nin Saxony and Skye, with igneous intrusions. In both localities it\r\nhas been shown to result from the inclusion of basic rocks, such as\r\ndolerites and gabbros, in a bath of some invading magma. The lens-like\r\nform of the Saxon masses, and the occurrence also of sheets of\r\npyroxene-granulite interlaminated with fine-grained granite, were till\r\nlately attributed to the rolling-out action of pressure-metamorphism.\r\nBy what H. Credner calls a complete reversal of opinion, due mainly\r\nto the opening of new railway-sections, the granular eclogites of\r\nSaxony are now regarded as products of extreme contact-alteration,\r\ncombined with igneous flow[97]. A. Harker[98] similarly points out that\r\nexamples in Skye are derived from basaltic lavas, into which gabbro has\r\nintruded, producing a complete reconstruction of the rock.\r\n\r\nWhere a series of igneous rocks and sediments, in some cases already\r\naltered by pressure, has been attacked and partly melted up by granite,\r\namphibolite-blocks are found as the common residue in the mingled mass.\r\nThe quartzites and mica-schists of the mantle that overlies the granite\r\ndome may have disappeared by stoping and absorption (see p. 126). Rocks\r\nrich in amphibole remain, and they commonly contain pyroxene as well as\r\nhornblende. In some cases, as in Skye and Saxony, they may be traced\r\nto basic igneous rocks; but in others they may be referred with equal\r\ncertainty to limestone. The interaction of the granite magma and the\r\ncalcareous sediment has produced a silicate rock completely different\r\nfrom either.\r\n\r\nLévy[99] and Lacroix have shown how the amphibolites of France may\r\nsometimes represent dolerites, sometimes limestones. Their work has\r\nrecently received striking support from the observations of the\r\nGeological Survey of Canada[100]. Streaky hornblende-gneisses over\r\nwide areas of Ontario are now attributed to the partial absorption\r\nof overlying limestone by what was once regarded as a \"fundamental\"\r\ngranite. The amphibolite blocks have become drawn out into bands that\r\nfollow all the flow-structure of the invading igneous mass. A small\r\narea of the same kind was studied in 1900 in north-west Ireland[101],\r\nwhere a remarkably pure granitoid rock, consisting of quartz and alkali\r\nfelspar, has become enriched with dark mica at the expense of blocks of\r\namphibolite included in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHIC MARBLES AND QUARTZITES\r\n\r\nSome of the changes that convert limestone into crystalline marble have\r\nalready been referred to on pp. 36 and 54. The presence of mica in\r\nlimestones may allow of foliation when pressure comes to be applied to\r\nthem, and _calc-schists_ result. The mica may be detrital, or may arise\r\nthrough the metamorphism of clayey bands; but it forms weak layers,\r\nalong which the shearing movements take place which lead to a schistose\r\nstructure in the mass. Pure granular marble may also occasionally\r\nbecome converted into a calc-schist, by deformation of its crystalline\r\ngrains along gliding planes within each crystal.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider quartzites, the same question rises as in the case\r\nof crystalline limestones, and it is often difficult to state that a\r\nquartzite owes its characters to metamorphism. Microscopic examination\r\nsometimes reveals the effects of earth-pressures in the crushed and\r\npowdered condition of the larger grains; and no rocks exhibit the power\r\nof such pressures in producing structural modifications more strikingly\r\nthan the coarse quartz-grits that are sometimes involved in regions of\r\ndynamic metamorphism. Pebbles and grains are alike deformed, pressed\r\nout along planes of fracture, and finally reduced to bands of powdered\r\nquartz. When felspathic pebbles occur in these grits, the resulting\r\nschistose mass has almost the appearance of a banded igneous rock, and\r\nstreaky white mica may arise from the alteration of potassium felspar.\r\n\r\nSome sandstones contain sufficient felspar or calcium carbonate to\r\nform a flux when they are subjected to thermal metamorphism. At times\r\na glass thus arises between the grains, and reacts upon the original\r\nquartz. When the igneous magma has melted up a sandstone or a\r\nquartzite, blocks of the sediment may remain surrounded by a mixed and\r\nrecrystallised product from both rocks. Wright and Bailey[102] have\r\nstudied an example in Colonsay, where a hornblende rock has partly\r\ndissolved a quartzite, the residual blocks being surrounded by \"halos\"\r\nof interaction, composed of quartz and alkali felspar.\r\n\r\n\r\nGNEISSES\r\n\r\n_Gneisses_ may be broadly defined as banded crystalline rocks in which\r\nfelspar is visible to the unaided eye. Though this will include many\r\nigneous masses, it is doubtful if a more rigid description can be\r\ngiven. Numerous gneisses, in fact, owe their parallel structures to\r\nflow while in a molten state. Others are rocks that have been deformed\r\nby pressure, and their constituents have become drawn out along planes\r\nof solid flow. Where actual shearing has taken place, the minerals in\r\nthe close neighbourhood of the planes of movement may become especially\r\nmodified, ground down, and deformed. The foliated structure may then\r\nbe marked by the appearance of differentiated bands. Such bands may\r\nalso arise from the spreading out under pressure of certain large\r\nconstituents, such as porphyritic crystals of felspar, which produce\r\nwhite bands, or of pyroxene, which will become modified into granular\r\namphibole and will produce dark streaks through the rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Composite Gneiss. Gartan Lough, Co. Donegal.\r\nFragments of mica-schist project from a gneiss, the banding of which\r\nfollows the foliation planes of the schist. On the right the mass\r\nretains less schist and is more granitic.]\r\n\r\nGneisses may also result from the intrusion of felspathic igneous\r\nrocks, in sheets of varying thickness, between the layers of a sediment\r\nor a schist (Fig. 19); or from the intrusion of one igneous rock into\r\nanother, with varying degrees of interaction and absorption.\r\n\r\nIt has often been presumed that the invaded igneous rock must have\r\nbeen in such cases in a plastic state. The supply of heat within the\r\nearth during such processes, and the action of the gases, corroding, as\r\nDoelter says, \"like a blowpipe-flame,\" are, however, clearly sufficient\r\nto melt down large blocks, the residue being then carried forward as\r\nwisps or bands in the invader.\r\n\r\nMany strikingly banded gneisses are thus of composite origin. Their\r\nfelspathic granitoid bands can be traced in the field to an igneous\r\nsource, while their darker and usually micaceous layers can as surely\r\nbe attributed to the invasion and incorporation of adjacent schists\r\n(Fig. 20). But it is quite possible that in other cases the banded\r\ngneiss is a sedimentary rock which has undergone what Judd[103] has\r\nstyled \"statical metamorphism.\" The differences in successive bands\r\nare then due to original differences in successive strata; one has\r\nyielded a granitic layer, one a layer of quartzite, one, which was more\r\nargillaceous, a layer of mica-schist. The bands in such a gneiss record\r\nthe stratification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Composite Gneiss formed by intrusion of granite\r\ninto hornblende-schist. Ängnö, near Saltsjöbaden, Sweden.]\r\n\r\nGneisses are often described as if they consisted of layers of various\r\nminerals, quartz, felspar, and mica, alternating one with another. As a\r\nmatter of fact, a gneiss may exist in which there is no differentiation\r\ninto layers; the whole of the constituents have been drawn out and\r\nelongated, any mica present becoming naturally conspicuous by its\r\nflattened wisp-like forms. The banded gneisses, on the other hand,\r\nwhere layer-structure is obvious, consist in reality of bands of\r\ndifferent rock-types. Sometimes all the layers are granitoid, but one\r\nband will contain only quartz and felspar, while another will contain\r\nthe same minerals with an admixture, and perhaps a great predominance,\r\nof mica.\r\n\r\nG. P. Scrope[104] made an immense step forward when he realised in\r\n1825 that such banded rocks, \"the inferior crystalline zones,\" might\r\nbe pushed out of position and \"protruded\" among others \"in a solid or\r\nnearly solid state.\" He goes on, \"The protrusion of the foliated rocks,\r\ngneiss, mica-schist, clay-slate, etc. was chiefly occasioned by their\r\npeculiar structure; the parallel plane surfaces of their component\r\ncrystals, particularly the plates of mica, sliding with facility\r\nover one another; while the laminar structure of these rocks was in\r\nturn increased during this process, the crystals being elongated in\r\nthe direction of their motion, as in the case of the clinkstones and\r\npearl-stones of the trachytic formation.\" After this, there was little\r\nleft for the later advocates of dynamo metamorphism to put forward.\r\n\r\nWhile Darwin[105] recognised how the granite at Cape Town had\r\nworked its way insidiously between the layers of a schist, it was\r\nleft for Michel Lévy to emphasise the part played by what is called\r\n_lit-par-lit_ injection in the making of banded gneiss (see p. 120).\r\nK. A. Lossen, Johann Lehmann, and other distinguished workers in\r\nGermany made clear, on the other hand, the effects of pressure in\r\nmoulding and reforming crystalline rocks, and even in bringing about\r\nthe crystallisation of certain minerals in a previously sedimentary\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo-metamorphic school assumed immense importance from 1884\r\nonwards, the date of the publication of Lehmann's work on \"Die\r\nEntstehung der altkrystallinischen Schiefergesteine,\" and for a time\r\nthe intrusion of igneous masses was held, both in Germany and the\r\nBritish Isles, to have had a merely local significance as a metamorphic\r\nagent. Wherever \"regional metamorphism\" was spoken of, pressure-effects\r\nwere held to be predominant. Indeed, the profound modifications that\r\nmay occur in rocks when lowered into subterranean cauldrons is only now\r\nbecoming generally realised. The tendency to regard the structures of\r\nlarge masses of gneiss as of necessity due to deformation and shearing\r\nin a solid state has, however, passed away[106].\r\n\r\nPressure-effects are of course clearly traceable in most gneisses,\r\nand are of immense importance in many metamorphic areas; but we find\r\nagain and again that gneissic structure has been injured rather than\r\ndeveloped by crushing subsequent to the consolidation of the rock.\r\nIn some cases, where this structure is due to igneous flow, which\r\nof course often took place under considerable pressure, even the\r\npuckerings of the stratified or foliated rock which was invaded by\r\nthe igneous magma have been followed by the invading sheets. In other\r\ncases, as in the composite amphibolite gneiss of Canada, or the similar\r\nrocks of the Ox Mountains in Ireland, the contortions in the mingled\r\nmass are clearly due to the viscid flow of the consolidating invader.\r\n\r\nThe growing appreciation of the views on recurrent thermal metamorphism\r\nthat were originally propounded by James Hutton in 1785 has led to\r\nthe assignment of far younger ages to many masses previously regarded\r\nas \"fundamental\" and Archæan. Some of these rocks are undoubtedly\r\nof high antiquity, but are found to be intrusive in strata of a\r\nlate pre-Cambrian series. Others, such as the material of the Saxon\r\nlaccolite, and the gneisses on the north-east Bohemian border, are now\r\nknown to be of Upper Palæozoic age.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF A FUNDAMENTAL GNEISS\r\n\r\nEver since A. C. Lawson[107] showed in Canada how the Laurentian gneiss\r\nhad invaded and swallowed up the overlying Huronian rocks, suspicion\r\nbegan to fall on the doctrine of a \"fundamental\" gneiss. We may now\r\nwell ask ourselves the following questions:--\r\n\r\n(i) Was there a time in the early history of our globe when schists\r\nand gneisses were deposited as a prevalent type of sediment, under\r\nconditions which have not since recurred?\r\n\r\n(ii) If so, which of the characters of these pre-Cambrian rocks are\r\noriginal, and which have been acquired through subsequent metamorphism?\r\n\r\n(iii) On the other hand, is the prevalence of gneiss and schist in\r\nearly pre-Cambrian groups of rock due to the fact that, the older the\r\nrock, the more metamorphism, by recurrent heat and pressure, it is\r\nlikely to have undergone?\r\n\r\n(iv) We may prefer the theory of Laplace, that the earth is cooling\r\nfrom a molten state; or the planetesimal theory, according to which\r\nheat has been developed during the consolidation and contraction of an\r\nagglomerate of solid particles; yet in either case we must admit that\r\nthe earth's outer layers were once nearer to the heated parts of the\r\nearth than they are now. Is it not likely, then, that early sediments\r\nbecame frequently immersed in baths of molten matter, and that\r\ncontact-metamorphism and admixture on a regional scale have produced\r\nin them the characters that have been attributed to a fundamental\r\ngneiss[108]?\r\n\r\nJ. J. Sederholm[109] has traced in Finland four groups of Archæan\r\nsedimentary material, which have been successively invaded by granite\r\nfrom the depths. The bare wave-swept isles of Spikarna, east of Hangö,\r\nserve as models of structures that are traceable throughout the Baltic\r\nlands. The more we regard the oldest gneisses of one region after\r\nanother, the more we see in them igneous matter that has attempted\r\nto assimilate sediments of still older date. The banded structures\r\nthat have been appealed to as indicating the power of earth-movements\r\nto deform the solid crystalline crust prove, in very many cases, to\r\nrecord the foliation of rocks that were already metamorphosed before\r\nthe igneous matter spread among them. In some of these cases, this\r\nfoliation followed planes of original stratification, and we are forced\r\nto conclude that true sedimentary structure may after all control\r\nthe features of a gnarled and contorted fundamental gneiss. We are\r\nstill far from discovering the primitive crust formed about a molten\r\nglobe, and the brilliant proofs of evolution in the organic world\r\nare unmatched by any evidence of the evolution of rock-types during\r\ngeological time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHIC ROCKS AND SCENERY\r\n\r\nMetamorphic rocks are usually associated with the scenery of mountain,\r\nmoor, and forest. The highly altered siliceous masses furnish but\r\nindifferent soils. The connexion between metamorphic rocks and\r\nearth-crumpling, and their frequent penetration by granite, lead to the\r\nproduction of rugged ridges and high moorlands, among which denudation\r\nhas cut romantic glens. The schists weather out on the valley-walls\r\nalong their foliation-surfaces, and scarps arise like those of\r\nstratified rocks. The face of such a scarp is broken away in a zigzag\r\nand splintery fashion, and the sharp edges of the foliated mass stand\r\nout like teeth upon the sky-line. Gneisses associated with the schists\r\npresent a contrast of smoother surfaces, wherever denudation has been\r\nlong continued. Foliated diorites and amphibolites, however, may\r\nproduce wild crags that even overhang; while recently exposed gneiss,\r\nat high altitudes, may give rise to pinnacles and serrated forms.\r\n\r\nWhere alternations of quartzite and mica-schist occur, irregularities\r\nof the surface are readily maintained. Heather climbs upon the yellow\r\nsoils furnished by the schist, and trees may gather in its hollows; but\r\nthe quartzite stands out bare and dominant. In some cases the upturned\r\nbeds of the latter weather out like dykes across the country.\r\n\r\nWorn-down plateaus of ancient gneiss, the mere residues of\r\nmountain-land, may be seen in the storm-swept levels of the Outer\r\nHebrides, and in the hummocky country, a swelling sea of bare grey rock\r\nand peat-filled hollows, that borders all the west of Sutherland. The\r\nirregular weathering of mica-schist, and the readiness with which it\r\ncan be carved by streams, control the bold landscapes of the highlands\r\nfrom the Trossachs to Lough Ness, and thence away again to the\r\nnorthern sea. Here and there, great domes of intrusive granite rise\r\namid the broken moorlands; at times, a white cone of quartzite catches\r\nthe eye with a gleam like that of snow. We may traverse this country\r\nas an introduction to the high glacial plateaus and deeply notched\r\nseaward slopes of the metamorphic lands of Norway; or to the contrasts\r\nof jagged schists and resisting gneisses that meets us as we near the\r\nAlpine core.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n  (_The numbers of volumes are given throughout in thick type; the\r\n  dates are between brackets, and the page-references follow in\r\n  ordinary figures._)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Cordier, \"Mémoire sur les substances dites en masse,\r\n     qui entrent dans la composition des Roches Volcaniques,\" Journ.\r\n     de Physique, =83= (1816), 135, 285, and 352.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: On specific gravity of mineral grains see especially\r\n     W.
