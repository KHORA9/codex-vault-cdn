As they were not written with\r\nany view to their subsequent appearance in a collected form, each is so\r\nfar independent and complete in itself. Under these circumstances some\r\nrepetition was unavoidable, if the articles were not to be recast, and\r\nI did not think it advisable to make such radical alteration. With the\r\nexception of verbal changes and some excisions, therefore, the papers\r\nremain substantially in their original state. Here and there a footnote\r\nhas been added to indicate where the views expressed in the text have\r\nsince been modified; but I have not been careful to insert such notes\r\nthroughout. Geologists, like other folk, live and learn, and the reader\r\nwill probably discover that the opinions set forth in some of the\r\nlater articles are occasionally in advance of those maintained in the\r\nwriter's earlier days.\r\n\r\nI have to thank the Publishers of _Good Words_ for allowing me to\r\nrepublish the articles on the Cheviot Hills and the Outer Hebrides.

THE GEOGRAPHICAL DEVELOPMENT OF COAST-LINES      393\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nGeography and Geology.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] Portion of a lecture given in 1886 to the Class of Geology in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Geography naturally occupies a prominent place in\r\nevery school curriculum. It is rightly considered essential that we\r\nshould from an early age begin to know something of our own and other\r\ncountries. I am not sure, however, that Geography is always taught in\r\nthe most interesting and effective manner. Indeed, according to some\r\ngeographers, who are well qualified to express an opinion, the manner\r\nin which their subject is presented in many of our schools leaves much\r\nto be desired. But a decided advance has been made in recent years,\r\nand with the multiplication of excellent text-books, maps, and other\r\nappliances, I have no doubt that this improvement will continue. When\r\nI attended school the text-books used by my teachers were about as\r\nrepellent as they could be. Our most important lesson was to commit to\r\nmemory a multitude of place-names, and the maps which were supposed\r\nto illustrate the text-books were, if possible, less interesting and\r\ninstructive. Nowadays, however, teachers have a number of more or less\r\nexcellent manuals at their service, and the educational maps issued by\r\nour cartographers show in many cases a very great advance on the bald\r\nand misleading caricatures which did duty in my young days as pictures\r\nof the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of some war we often remark that the task of\r\nfollowing the military operations compels us to brush up our Geography.\r\nI am uncharitable enough to suspect that it would frequently be\r\ntruer to say that, before these campaigns commenced, we had no such\r\nknowledge to brush up. The countries involved in the commotion were\r\nprobably mere names to many of us. We had no immediate interest in\r\nthem or their inhabitants, and had we been asked, before the outbreak\r\nof hostilities, to indicate the precise positions of the places upon a\r\nmap, some of us perhaps might have been sorely puzzled to do so. Nor\r\nis such ignorance always discreditable. One cannot know everything;\r\nthe land-surface of the globe contains upwards of 50 millions of\r\nsquare miles, and one may surely be excused for not having a detailed\r\nknowledge of this vast area. I have referred to the subject simply\r\nbecause I think it gives us a hint as to how the teaching of Political\r\nGeography might be made most instructive and interesting. Historical\r\nnarrative might often be interwoven with the subject in such a way\r\nas to fix geographical features indelibly on the memory. Striking\r\nand picturesque incidents, eventful wars, the rise and progress of\r\nparticular trades, the routes followed by commerce, the immigration\r\nand emigration of races, the gradual development of the existing\r\npolitical divisions of the Old World, the story of Columbus and the\r\nearly voyagers, the geographical discoveries of later times--all these,\r\nand such as these, might be introduced into our lessons in Political\r\nGeography. The wanderings of a Mungo Park, a Bruce, a Livingstone, a\r\nStanley, traced on a good map, could not fail to arrest the attention\r\nof the youthful student of African geography. In like manner, the\r\ncampaigns of the great Napoleon might be made to do good service\r\nin illustrating the geographical features of large portions of our\r\nown continent. Then, as regards Britain, what a world of poetry and\r\nromantic story clings to every portion of its surface--why, the very\r\nplace-names themselves might suggest to any intelligent teacher themes\r\nand incidents, the deft treatment of which would make the acquisition\r\nof Geography a delightful task to the dullest boy or girl.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relation that obtains between Political Geography and\r\nHistory has indeed long been recognised, and is in fact self-evident.\r\nAnd we are all well aware that in our school manuals of Geography it\r\nhas been usual for very many years to note the scenes of remarkable\r\nevents. Such notes, however, are of necessity extremely brief; and it\r\nneed hardly be said that to fully incorporate history in a text-book of\r\ngeneral Geography would be quite impracticable. It might be done to a\r\ncertain extent for our own and a few of the more important countries;\r\nbut similar detail need not be attempted in regard to regions which are\r\nof less consequence from the political point of view. Indeed, I should\r\nbe inclined to leave the proper application of historical knowledge in\r\nthe teaching of Geography very much to the teacher himself, who would\r\nnaturally select such themes and incidents as seemed best adapted to\r\nattract the attention of his pupils. Be that, however, as it may,\r\nit is enough for my present purpose if I insist upon the fact that\r\nthe proper study of Political Geography involves the acquisition of\r\nsome historical knowledge. One can hardly conceive the possibility\r\nof an intelligent student taking pains to become acquainted with the\r\npolitical geography of a country without at the same time endeavouring\r\nto learn something of its history--otherwise, his geographical\r\nattainments would hardly surpass those of a commercial traveller, whose\r\ngeographical studies have been confined to the maps and tables of his\r\nBradshaw.\r\n\r\nBut if it be impossible to ignore History in the teaching of Political\r\nGeography, it is just as impossible to exclude from our attention\r\ngreat physical features and characteristics. Surface-configuration,\r\nclimate, and natural products all claim our attention. It is obvious,\r\nin fact, that the proper study of Political Geography must give us\r\nat least a general notion of the configuration, the river-systems,\r\nand climatic conditions of many different lands. For has not the\r\npolitical development of races depended most largely on the physical\r\nconditions and natural resources of the countries occupied by them?\r\nSo far, then, as these have sensibly influenced the progress of\r\npeoples, they come naturally under the consideration of Political\r\nGeography. Thus, if Political Geography be closely connected and\r\ninterwoven, as it were, with History, not less intimate are its\r\nrelations to Physical Geography. It does not embrace all Physical\r\nGeography, but it introduces us to many facts and phenomena, the\r\ncauses and mutual relations of which we cannot understand without\r\nfirst mastering the teachings of Physical Geography. In the study of\r\nthis latter science we come more closely into contact with Nature;\r\nwe cease to think of the surface of the earth as parcelled out into\r\nso many lots by its human occupants--we no longer contemplate that\r\nsurface from the limited point of view of the political geographer--we\r\nare now not merely members of one particular community, but have\r\nbecome true citizens of the world. To us north and south, east and\r\nwest are of equal interest and importance. Our desire now is to\r\nunderstand, if haply we may, the complex system of which we ourselves\r\nform a part. The distribution of land and water--the configuration of\r\ncontinental areas and oceanic basins--the circulation of oceanic and\r\nterrestrial waters--earth-movements and volcanoes--ice-formations--the\r\natmosphere--climatology--the geographical distribution of plants\r\nand animals--in a word, _the world as one organic whole_ now forms\r\nthe subject of our contemplation. Such being the scope of Physical\r\nGeography, it is satisfactory to know that its importance as a subject\r\nof study in our schools has been fully recognised. This being admitted,\r\nI shall now proceed to show that Physical Geography, although, like\r\nPolitical Geography, it is a separate and distinct subject, yet, just\r\nas the study of the latter involves some knowledge of History, so\r\nthe prosecution of Physical Geography compels us to make a certain\r\nacquaintance with Geology. We cannot, in fact, learn much about the\r\natmosphere, about rain and rivers, glaciers and icebergs, earthquakes\r\nand volcanoes, and the causes of climate, without at the same time\r\nbecoming more or less familiar with the groundwork on which geological\r\ninvestigations are based. And just as a knowledge of history enables\r\nus better to understand the facts of Political Geography, so some\r\nacquaintance with the results of geological inquiry are necessary\r\nbefore we can hope to comprehend many of the phenomena of which\r\nPhysical Geography treats. Let me try to make this plain. The physical\r\ngeographer, we shall suppose, is considering the subject of terrestrial\r\nwaters. He tells us what is meant by the drainage-system of a country,\r\npoints out how the various minor water-courses or brooks and streams\r\nunite to form a river, describes for us the shape of the valley through\r\nwhich a typical river makes its way--how the valley-slope diminishes\r\nfrom the mountains onwards to the sea-coast--how, at first, in its\r\nupper or mountain-track, the flow of the river is torrential--how,\r\nas the slope of the valley decreases, the river begins to wind about\r\nmore freely, until it reaches the head of its plain-track or delta,\r\nwhen, no longer receiving affluents, it begins to divide, and enters\r\nthe sea at last by many mouths. He tells us further what proportion of\r\nthe rainfall of the country passes seawards in our river, and he can\r\nmeasure for us the quantity of water which is actually discharged. All\r\nthis is purely Physical Geography; but when we come to ask why some\r\nrivers flow in deep cañons, like those of the Colorado--why valleys\r\nshould widen out in one part and contract, as it were, elsewhere--why\r\nthe courses of some rivers are interrupted by waterfalls and rapids,\r\nand many other similar questions, the physical geographer must know\r\nsomething of Geology before he can give an answer. He can describe\r\nthe actual existing conditions; without the aid of Geology, he can\r\ntell us nothing of their origin and cause. So the political geographer\r\ncan map out for us the present limits of the various countries of\r\nEurope, but History must be invoked if we would know how those\r\nboundaries came to be determined. The moment, therefore, the physical\r\ngeographer begins to inquire into the origin of any particular\r\nphysical feature, he enters upon the domains of the geologist. And as\r\nhe cannot possibly avoid doing so, it is quite common now to find a\r\ngood deal of the subject-matter of Geology treated of in text-books\r\nof Physical Geography. I state this merely to show how very closely\r\nthe two sciences are interlocked. Take, for example, the configuration\r\nof river valleys just referred to. The physical geographer recognises\r\nthe fact that a river performs work; by means of the sediment which\r\nit carries in suspension and rolls along its course, it erodes its\r\nbed in many places, and undermines its banks, and thus its channel is\r\ndeepened and widened. He can measure the amount of sediment which it\r\ncarries down to the sea, and the quantity of saline matters which its\r\nwaters hold in solution: and knowing that all these substances have\r\nbeen abstracted from the land, he is able to estimate approximately\r\nthe amount of material which is annually transferred from the surface\r\nof the drainage-area involved. He discovers this to be so relatively\r\nenormous that he has no difficulty in believing that the valleys\r\nin which rivers flow might have been hollowed out by the rivers\r\nthemselves. But, without trespassing further into the geologist's\r\ndomains, he cannot go beyond this: and you will at once perceive that\r\nsomething more is required to prove that any particular valley owes its\r\norigin to the erosive action of running water. Suppose someone were\r\nto suggest to him that his river-valley might be a minor wrinkle in\r\nthe earth's crust caused by earth-movements, or that it might indicate\r\nthe line of a fissure or dislocation, due to some comparatively recent\r\nconvulsion--how could his computation of the amount of material at\r\npresent carried seawards by the river prove such suggestions to be\r\nerroneous? And what light could it throw upon the origin of the\r\nvaried configuration of the river-valley--how would it explain the\r\npresence or absence of cascades and rapids, of narrow gorges and open\r\nexpanses? None of these phenomena can be interpreted and accounted\r\nfor without the aid of the geologist: without some knowledge of rocks\r\nand rock-structures, the origin of the earth's surface-features\r\nis quite inexplicable. To give an adequate explanation of all the\r\nsurface-features of a country in detail would of course require a\r\nprofound study of Geology; but a general acquaintance only with its\r\nelementary facts is quite sufficient to enable us to form a reasonable\r\nand intelligent view of the cause and origin of the main features\r\nof the land as a whole. Thus a few lessons in elementary Geology\r\nwould make clear to any child how rivers have excavated valleys, why\r\ncataracts and gorges occur here, and open valleys with gently-flowing\r\nwaters elsewhere.\r\n\r\nLet me select yet another example to show how dependent Physical\r\nGeography is upon Geology. The physical geographer, in describing the\r\nfeatures of the land, tells us how the great continental areas are\r\ntraversed in various directions by what he calls mountain-chains. Thus,\r\nin speaking of America, he tells us that it may be taken as a type\r\nof the continental structure--namely a vast expanse of land, low or\r\nbasin-like in the interior, and flanked along the maritime regions by\r\nelevated mountain borders--the highest border facing the deepest ocean.\r\nHe points out further that the great continental areas are crossed from\r\nwest to east by well-marked depressions, to a large extent occupied\r\nby water. Thus Europe is separated from Africa by the Mediterranean,\r\na depression which is continued eastward through the Black Sea into\r\nthe Aralo-Caspian area. South America is all but cut away from North\r\nAmerica, while Australia is separated from Asia by the East India Seas.\r\nWe find, in fact, all over the world that well-marked natural features\r\nare constantly being repeated. Not only do the great land-masses\r\nof the globe bear certain resemblances to each other, but even in\r\ntheir detailed structure similar parallelisms recur. The physical\r\ngeographer notes all these remarkable phenomena, but he can give us\r\nno clue to their meaning. He may describe with admirable skill the\r\ncharacteristic features of plains and plateaux, of volcanic mountains\r\nand mountain-chains, but he cannot tell us why plains should occur\r\nhere and mountains there; nor can he explain why some mountains, such\r\nas those of Scotland or Norway, differ so much in configuration from\r\nthe Alps and the Pyrenees. The answer to all these questions can only\r\nbe given by Geology. It is from this science we learn how continental\r\nareas and oceanic basins have been evolved. The patient study of the\r\nrocks has revealed the origin of the present configuration of the\r\nland. There is not a hill or valley, not a plateau or mountain-region,\r\nwhich does not reveal its own history. The geologist can tell you why\r\ncontinents are bordered by coast-ranges, and why their interiors are\r\ngenerally comparatively low and basin-shaped. The oceanic basins and\r\ncontinental areas, we learn, are primeval wrinkles in the earth's\r\ncrust, caused by its irregular subsidence upon the gradually cooling\r\nand contracting nucleus. The continents are immense plateau-like areas\r\nrising more or less abruptly above those stupendous depressions\r\nof the earth's crust which are occupied by the ocean. While those\r\ndepressions are in progress the maritime borders of the land-areas are\r\nsubjected to enormous squeezing and crushing, and coast-ranges are the\r\nresult--the elevation of those ranges necessarily holding some relation\r\nto the depth of the contiguous ocean. For, the deeper the ocean the\r\ngreater has been the depression under the sea, and, consequently,\r\nthe more intense the upheaval along the continental borders. It is\r\nfor the same reason that destructive earthquakes are most likely to\r\noccur in the vicinity of coast-ranges which are of comparatively\r\nrecent geological age. These, and indeed all, mountains of elevation\r\nare lines of weakness along which earth-movements may continue from\r\ntime to time to take place. But all mountains are not mountains of\r\nelevation; many elevated regions owe their mountainous character simply\r\nto the erosive action of sub-aërial agents, such as rain, frost, ice,\r\nand running water, the forms assumed by the mountains being due to\r\ntheir petrological character and geological structure. There are,\r\nfor example, no true mountains of elevation in Scotland; hence to\r\nwrite of the _chain of the Grampians_ or the _range of the Lowthers_\r\nis incorrect and actually misleading. Without the aid of Geology the\r\ngeographer cannot, in fact, discriminate between mountains of elevation\r\nand mountains of denudation; hence geographical terms so constantly in\r\nuse as _mountain-range_ and _mountain-chain_ are very often applied by\r\nwriters, ignorant of geological structure, to elevated regions which\r\nhave no claim to be described either as _chains_ or _ranges_. Some\r\nknowledge of Geology, therefore, is essential to us if we would have\r\ncorrect views of many of the grandest features of the globe. But it\r\nwill be said that, after all, the physical geographer deals with the\r\nearth as we now find it; he does not need to trouble himself with the\r\norigin of the phenomena he describes. Well, as I have just shown, he\r\ncannot, even if he would, escape trenching on Geology; and if he could,\r\nhis subject would be shorn of much of its interest. He recognises that\r\nthe world he studies has in it the elements of change--the forces of\r\nNature are everywhere modifying the earth's surface--considerable\r\nchanges are sometimes brought about even in one's lifetime, while\r\nwithin the course of historical ages still greater mutations have\r\ntaken place--he becomes conscious, in short, that the existing state\r\nof things is but the latest phase of an interminable series of changes\r\nstretching back into the illimitable past, and destined to be prolonged\r\ninto the indefinite future. Thus he gladly welcomes the labours of the\r\ngeologist, whose researches into the past have thrown such a flood of\r\nlight upon the present. In fact, he can no more divorce his attention\r\nfrom the results of geological inquiry than the political geographer\r\ncan shut his eyes to the facts of History.\r\n\r\nLet me, in conclusion, give one further illustration of the close\r\ninter-dependence of the two sciences of which I am speaking. One of the\r\nsubjects treated of by Physical Geography is the present geographical\r\ndistribution of plants and animals. The land-surface of the globe has\r\nbeen mapped out into so many biological regions, each of which is\r\ncharacterised by its special fauna and flora. The greatest changes in\r\nthe flora and fauna of a continent are met with as we pass from south\r\nto north, or _vice versa_. Proceeding in the direction of the latitude,\r\nthe changes encountered are much less striking. Now, these facts are\r\nreadily explained by the physical geographer, who points out that\r\nthe distribution is due chiefly to climatic conditions--a conclusion\r\nwhich is obvious enough. But when we go into details we find that mere\r\nlatitude will not account for all the phenomena. Take, for example,\r\nthe case of the Scandinavian flora of our own Continent. It is true\r\nthat this flora is largely confined to northern latitudes; but isolated\r\ncolonies occur in our own mountains and in the mountains of middle\r\nand southern Europe. How are these to be accounted for? The physical\r\ngeographer says that the plants grow there simply because they obtain\r\nat high levels in low latitudes the favourable climatic conditions\r\nunderneath which they flourish at low levels in high latitudes. He\r\ntherefore concludes that the distribution of life-forms is due to\r\nvarying climatic and physical conditions. But if we ask him how those\r\ncurious colonies of foreigners come to be planted on our mountains,\r\nhe cannot tell. To get our answer we must come to the geologist; and\r\nhe will explain that they are, as it were, living fossils--monuments\r\nof former great physical and climatic changes. He will prove to us\r\nthat the climate of Europe was at a recent geological period so cold\r\nthat the Scandinavian flora spread south into middle Europe, where it\r\noccupied the low grounds. When the climate became milder, then the\r\nnorthern invaders gradually retired--the main body migrating back\r\nto the north--while some stragglers, retreating before the stronger\r\nGermanic flora, took shelter in the mountains, whither the latter could\r\nnot or would not follow, and so there our Scandinavians remain, the\r\nsilent witnesses of a stupendous climatic revolution. Now, all the\r\nworld over, plants and animals have similar wonderful tales to tell of\r\nformer geographical changes. The flora and fauna of our country, for\r\nexample, prove that the British Islands formed part of the Continent at\r\na very recent geological period; and so, from similar evidence, we know\r\nthat not long ago Europe was joined on to Africa. On the other hand,\r\nthe facts connected with the present distribution of life demonstrate\r\nthat some areas, such as Australia, have been separated from the\r\nnearest continental land for vastly prolonged periods of time.\r\n\r\nIt would be a very easy matter to adduce many further illustrations to\r\nshow how close is the connection between the studies of the physical\r\ngeographer and the geologist. I do not indeed exaggerate when I say\r\nthat no one can hope to become a geologist who is not well versed in\r\nPhysical Geography; nor, on the other hand, can the physical geographer\r\npossibly dispense with the aid of Geology. The two subjects are as\r\nclosely related and interwoven, the one with the other, as History is\r\nwith Political Geography. I do not see therefore how educationists who\r\nhave admitted the great importance of Physical Geography as a branch\r\nof general education, can logically exclude Geology as a subject of\r\ninstruction in schools. Already, indeed, it has been introduced by many\r\nteachers, and I am confident that ere long it will be as generally\r\ntaught as Physical Geography. I would not, however, present the subject\r\nto young people as a lesson to be learned from books. A good teacher\r\nshould be able to dispense with these helps, or rather hindrances--for\r\nsuch they really are to a young beginner. His pupils ought to have\r\npreviously studied the subject of Physical Geography, and if they have\r\nbeen well taught they ought to have already acquired no mean store of\r\ngeological knowledge. They ought, in fact, to have learned a good deal\r\nabout the great forces which are continually modifying the surface of\r\nthe globe, and what they have now to do is to study more particularly\r\nthe results which have followed from the constant operation of\r\nthose forces. We shall suppose, for example, that the teacher has\r\ndescribed how rivers erode their channels, and waves tend to cut back\r\na coast-line, and how the products of erosion, consisting of gravel,\r\nsand, and mud, are distributed along river-valleys and accumulated in\r\nlakes and seas. He now exhibits to his class good-sized fragments of\r\nconglomerate, sandstone, and shale, and points out how each of these\r\nrocks is of essentially the same character, and must therefore have\r\nhad the same origin, as modern sedimentary accumulations. His pupils\r\nshould be encouraged to examine the rocks of their own neighbourhood,\r\nwhether exhibited in natural sections or artificial exposures, and to\r\ncompare these with the products of modern geological action. One hour's\r\ninstruction in the field is, in fact, worth twenty hours of reading\r\nor listening to lectures. Knowledge at first hand is what is wanted.\r\nThere are many excellent popular or elementary treatises dealing with\r\nHistorical Geology, and these have their uses, and may be read with\r\nprofit as well as pleasure. But the mere reading of such books, it is\r\nneedless to say, will never make us geologists. They help no doubt to\r\nstore the mind with interesting and entertaining knowledge, but they do\r\nnot cultivate the faculties of observation and reasoning. And unless\r\ngeology is so taught as to accomplish this result, I do not see why it\r\nshould enter into any school curriculum. Further, I would remark that,\r\nhowever interesting a geological treatise may be, it cannot possibly\r\nstimulate the imagination as the practical study of the science\r\nis bound to do. One may put into the hands of a youth a clear and\r\nwell-written description of some particular fossiliferous limestone,\r\nand he may by dint of slavish toil be able to repeat verbatim all\r\nthat he has read. That is how a good deal of book-knowledge of science\r\nis acquired. Only think, however, of the drudgery it involves--the\r\nabsolute waste of time and energy. But let us illustrate our lesson\r\nby means of a lump of the limestone itself; let us show him the\r\ncharacter of the rock and the nature of its fossil contents, and his\r\ndifficulties disappear. Better still--let us take him, if we can, into\r\na limestone quarry, and he will be a dull boy indeed if he fails fully\r\nto understand what limestone is, or to realise the fact that the rock\r\nhe is looking at accumulated slowly, like existing oceanic formations,\r\nat the bottom of a sea that teemed with animal life. It is unnecessary,\r\nhowever, that I should illustrate this subject further. I would only\r\nrepeat that the beginner should be taught from the very first to use\r\nhis own eyes, and to draw logical conclusions from the facts which\r\nhe observes. Trained after this manner, he would acquire, not only a\r\nprecise and definite knowledge of what geological data really are,\r\nbut he would learn also how to interpret those data. He would become\r\nfamiliar, in fact, with the guiding principles of geological inquiry.\r\n\r\nHow much or how little of Historical Geology should be given in schools\r\nwill depend upon circumstances. Great care, however, should be taken to\r\navoid wearying the youthful student with strings of mere names. What\r\ngood is gained by learning to repeat the names of fifty or a hundred\r\nfossils, if you cannot recognise any one of these when it is put into\r\nyour hand? With young beginners I should not attempt anything of that\r\nkind. If the neighbourhood chanced to be rich in fossils, I should\r\ntake my pupils out on Saturday to the sections where they were found,\r\nand let them ply their hammers and collect specimens for themselves. I\r\nshould describe no fossils which they had not seen and handled. Of the\r\nmore remarkable forms of extinct animals and plants, which are often\r\nrepresented by only fragmentary remains, I should exhibit drawings\r\nshowing the creatures as they have been restored by the labours of\r\ncomparative anatomists. Such restorations and ideal views of geological\r\nscenes like those given by Heer, Dana, Saporta, and others, convey far\r\nmore vivid impressions of the life of a geological period than the\r\nmost elaborate description. In fine, the story of our earth should be\r\ntold much in the same manner as Scott wrote the history of Scotland\r\nfor his grandson. There is no more reason for requiring the juvenile\r\nstudent to drudge through minute geological data before introducing him\r\nto the grand results of geological investigation, than there is for\r\ncompelling him to study the manuscripts in our Record Offices before\r\nallowing him to read the history which has been drawn from these and\r\nsimilar sources of information. It is enough if at the beginning of\r\nhis studies he has already learned the general nature of geological\r\nevidence and the method of its interpretation. Provided with such a\r\nstock of geological knowledge as I have indicated, our youth would\r\nleave school with some intelligent appreciation of existing physical\r\nconditions, and a not inadequate conception of world-history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Physical Features of Scotland.[B]\r\n\r\n[B] _Scottish Geographical Magazine_, vol. i., 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nScotland, like \"all Gaul,\" is divided into three parts, namely, the\r\nHighlands, the Central Lowlands, and the Southern Uplands. These, as a\r\ncorrectly drawn map will show, are natural divisions, for they are in\r\naccordance not only with the actual configuration of the surface, but\r\nwith the geological structure of the country. The boundaries of these\r\nprincipal districts are well defined. Thus, an approximately straight\r\nor gently undulating line taken from Stonehaven, in a south-west\r\ndirection, along the northern outskirts of Strathmore to Glen Artney,\r\nand thence through the lower reaches of Loch Lomond to the Firth of\r\nClyde at Kilcreggan, marks out with precision the southern limits of\r\nthe Highland area and the northern boundary of the Central Lowlands.\r\nThe line that separates the Central Lowlands from the Southern Uplands\r\nis hardly so prominently marked throughout its entire course, but it\r\nfollows precisely the same north-east and south-west trend, and may\r\nbe traced from Dunbar along the base of the Lammermoor and Moorfoot\r\nHills, the Lowthers, and the hills of Galloway and Carrick, to Girvan.\r\nIn each of the two mountain-tracts--the Highlands and the Southern\r\nUplands--areas of low-lying land occur, while in the intermediate\r\nCentral Lowlands isolated prominences and certain well-defined belts\r\nof hilly ground make their appearance. The statement, so frequently\r\nrepeated in class-books and manuals of geography, that the mountains of\r\nScotland consist of three (some writers say five) \"ranges\" is erroneous\r\nand misleading. The original author of this strange statement probably\r\nderived his ignorance of the physical features of the country from\r\na study of those antiquated maps upon which the mountains of poor\r\nScotland are represented as sprawling and wriggling about like so many\r\ninebriated centipedes and convulsed caterpillars. Properly speaking,\r\nthere is not a true mountain-range in the country. If we take this\r\nterm, which has been very loosely used, to signify a linear belt of\r\nmountains--that is, an elevated ridge notched by cols or \"passes\"\r\nand traversed by transverse valleys--then in place of \"three\" or\r\n\"five\" such ranges we might just as well enumerate fifty or sixty, or\r\nmore, in the Highlands and Southern Uplands. Or, should any number\r\nof such dominant ridges be included under the term \"mountain-range,\"\r\nthere seems no reason why all the mountains of the country should\r\nnot be massed under one head and styled the \"Scottish Range.\" A\r\nmountain-range, properly so called, is a belt of high ground which has\r\nbeen ridged up by earth-movements. It is a fold, pucker, or wrinkle\r\nin the earth's crust, and its general external form coincides more or\r\nless closely with the structure or arrangement of the rock-masses of\r\nwhich it is composed. A mountain-range of this characteristic type,\r\nhowever, seldom occurs singly, but is usually associated with other\r\nparallel ranges of the same kind--the whole forming together what\r\nis called a \"mountain-chain,\" of which the Alps may be taken as an\r\nexample. That chain consists of a vast succession of various kinds of\r\nrocks, which at one time were disposed in horizontal layers or strata.\r\nBut during subsequent earth-movements those horizontal beds were\r\ncompressed laterally, squeezed, crumpled, contorted, and thrown, as it\r\nwere, into gigantic undulations and sharper folds and plications. And,\r\nnotwithstanding the enormous erosion or denudation to which the long\r\nparallel ridges or ranges have been subjected, we can yet see that the\r\ngeneral contour of these corresponds in large measure to the plications\r\nor foldings of the strata. This is well shown in the Jura, the parallel\r\nranges and intermediate hollows of which are formed by undulations of\r\nthe folded strata--the tops of the long hills coinciding more or less\r\nclosely with the arches, and the intervening hollows with the troughs.\r\nNow folded, crumpled, and contorted rock-masses are common enough in\r\nthe mountainous parts of Scotland, but the configuration of the surface\r\nrarely or never coincides with the inclination of the underlying\r\nstrata. The mountain-crests, so far from being formed by the tops of\r\ngreat folds of the strata, frequently show precisely the opposite kind\r\nof structure. In other words, the rocks, instead of being inclined away\r\nfrom the hill-tops like the roof of a house from its central ridge,\r\noften dip into the mountains. When they do so on opposite sides the\r\nstrata of which the mountains are built up seem arranged like a pile of\r\nsaucers, one within another.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another feature which brings out clearly the fact that the\r\nslopes of the surface have not been determined by the inclination of\r\nthe strata. The main water-parting that separates the drainage-system\r\nof the west from that of the east of Scotland does not coincide with\r\nany axis of elevation. It is not formed by an anticlinal fold or\r\n\"saddleback.\" In point of fact it traverses the strata at all angles\r\nto their inclination. But this would not have been the case had the\r\nScottish mountains consisted of a chain of true mountain-ranges. Our\r\nmountains, therefore, are merely monuments of denudation, they are\r\nthe relics of elevated plateaux which have been deeply furrowed and\r\ntrenched by running water and other agents of erosion. A short sketch\r\nof the leading features presented by the three divisions of the country\r\nwill serve to make this plain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Highlands.--The southern boundary of this, the most extensive of\r\nthe three divisions, has already been defined. The straightness of\r\nthat boundary is due to the fact that it coincides with a great line\r\nof fracture of the earth's crust--on the north or Highland side of\r\nwhich occur slates, schists, and various other hard and tough rocks,\r\nwhile on the south side the prevailing strata are sandstones, etc.,\r\nwhich are not of so durable a character. The latter, in consequence\r\nof the comparative ease with which they yield to the attacks of the\r\neroding agents--rain and rivers, frost and ice--have been worn away to\r\na greater extent than the former, and hence the Highlands, along their\r\nsouthern margin, abut more or less abruptly upon the Lowlands. Looking\r\nacross Strathmore from the Sidlaws or the Ochils, the mountains seem\r\nto spring suddenly from the low grounds at their base, and to extend\r\nnorth-east and south-west, as a great wall-like rampart. The whole area\r\nnorth and west of this line may be said to be mountainous, its average\r\nelevation being probably not less than 1500 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nA glance at the contoured or the shaded sheets of the Ordnance Survey's\r\nmap of Scotland will show better than any verbal description the\r\nmanner in which our Highland mountains are grouped. It will be at once\r\nseen that to apply the term \"range\" to any particular area of those\r\nhigh grounds is simply a misuse of terms. Not only are the mountains\r\nnot formed by plications and folds, but they do not even trend in\r\nlinear directions. It is true that a well-trained eye can detect\r\ncertain differences in the form and often in the colouring of the\r\nmountains when these are traversed from south-east to north-west. Such\r\ndifferences correspond to changes in the composition and structure of\r\nthe rock-masses, which are disposed or arranged in a series of broad\r\nbelts and narrower bands, running from south-west to north-east across\r\nthe whole breadth of the Highlands. Each particular kind of rock gives\r\nrise to a special configuration, or to certain characteristic features.\r\nThus, the mountains that occur within a belt of slate, often show a\r\nsharply cut outline, with more or less pointed peaks and somewhat\r\nserrated ridges--the Aberuchill Hills, near Comrie, are an example. In\r\nregions of gneiss and granite the mountains are usually rounded and\r\nlumpy in form. Amongst the schists, again, the outlines are generally\r\nmore angular. Quartz-rock often shows peaked and jagged outlines;\r\nwhile each variety of rock has its own particular colour, and this in\r\ncertain states of the atmosphere is very marked. The mode in which the\r\nvarious rocks yield to the \"weather\"--the forms of their cliffs and\r\ncorries--these and many other features strike a geologist at once; and\r\ntherefore, if we are to subdivide the Highland mountains into \"ranges,\"\r\na geological classification seems the only natural arrangement that can\r\nbe followed. Unfortunately, however, our geological lines, separating\r\none belt or \"range\" from another, often run across the very heart\r\nof great mountain-masses. Our \"ranges\" are distinguished from each\r\nother simply by superficial differences of feature and structure. No\r\nlong parallel hollows separate a \"range\" of schist-mountains from\r\nthe succeeding \"ranges\" of quartz-rock, gneiss, or granite. And no\r\ndegree of careful contouring could succeed in expressing the niceties\r\nof configuration just referred to, unless the maps were on a very\r\nlarge scale indeed. A geological classification or grouping of the\r\nmountains into linear belts cannot therefore be shown upon any ordinary\r\norographical map. Such a map can present only the relative heights\r\nand disposition of the mountain-masses, and these last, in the case\r\nof the Highlands, as we have seen, cannot be called \"ranges\" without\r\nstraining the use of that term. Any wide tract of the Highlands, when\r\nviewed from a commanding position, looks like a tumbled ocean in\r\nwhich the waves appear to be moving in all directions. One is also\r\nimpressed with the fact that the undulations of the surface, however\r\ninterrupted they may be, are broad--the mountains, however they may\r\nvary in detail according to the character of the rocks, are massive,\r\nand generally round-shouldered and often somewhat flat-topped, while\r\nthere is no great disparity of height amongst the dominant points of\r\nany individual group. Let us take, for example, the knot of mountains\r\nbetween Loch Maree and Loch Torridon. There we have a cluster of eight\r\npyramidal mountain-masses, the summits of which do not differ much in\r\nelevation. Thus in Liathach two points reach 3358 feet and 3486 feet;\r\nin Beinn Alligin there are also two points reaching 3021 feet and\r\n3232 feet respectively; in Beinn Dearg we have a height of 2995 feet;\r\nin Beinn Eighe are three dominant points--3188 feet, 3217 feet, and\r\n3309 feet. The four pyramids to the north are somewhat lower--their\r\nelevations being 2860 feet, 2801 feet, 2370 feet, and 2892 feet. The\r\nmountains of Lochaber and the Monadhliath Mountains exhibit similar\r\nrelationships; and the same holds good with all the mountain-masses of\r\nthe Highlands. No geologist can doubt that such relationship is the\r\nresult of denudation. The mountains are monuments of erosion--they\r\nare the wreck of an old table-land--the upper surface and original\r\ninclination of which are approximately indicated by the summits of the\r\nvarious mountain-masses and the direction of the principal water-flows.\r\nIf we in imagination fill up the valleys with the rock-material which\r\nformerly occupied their place, we shall in some measure restore the\r\ngeneral aspect of the Highland area before its mountains began to be\r\nshaped out by Nature's saws and chisels.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that while streams descend from the various\r\nmountains to every point in the compass, their courses having often\r\nbeen determined by geological structure, etc., their waters yet tend\r\neventually to collect and flow as large rivers in certain definite\r\ndirections. These large rivers flow in the direction of the average\r\nslope of the ancient table-land, while the main water-partings that\r\nseparate the more extensive drainage-areas of the country mark out,\r\nin like manner, the dominant portions of the same old land-surface.\r\nThe water-parting of the North-west Highlands runs nearly north and\r\nsouth, keeping quite close to the western shore, so that nearly all the\r\ndrainage of that region flows inland. The general inclination of the\r\nNorth-west Highlands is therefore easterly towards Glenmore and the\r\nMoray Firth. In the region lying east of Glenmore the average slopes of\r\nthe land are indicated by the directions of the rivers Spey, Don, and\r\nTay. These two regions--the North-west and South-east Highlands--are\r\nclearly separated by the remarkable depression of Glenmore, which\r\nextends through Loch Linnhe, Loch Lochy, and Loch Ness, and the further\r\nextension of which towards the north-east is indicated by the straight\r\ncoast-line of the Moray Firth as far as Tarbat Ness. Now, this long\r\ndepression marks a line of fracture and displacement of very great\r\ngeological antiquity. The old plateau of the Highlands was fissured and\r\nsplit in two--that portion which lay to the north-west sinking along\r\nthe line of fissure to a great but at present unascertained depth. Thus\r\nthe waters that flowed down the slopes of the north-west portion of the\r\nbroken plateau were dammed by the long wall of rock on the \"up-cast,\"\r\nor south-east side of the fissure, and compelled to flow off to\r\nnorth-east and south-west along the line of breakage. The erosion thus\r\ninduced sufficed in the course of time to hollow out Glenmore and all\r\nthe mountain-valleys that open upon it from the west.\r\n\r\nThe inclination of that portion of the fissured plateau which lay to\r\nthe south-east is indicated, as already remarked, by the trend of\r\nthe principal rivers. It was north-east in the Spey district, nearly\r\ndue east in the area drained by the Don, east and south-east in that\r\ntraversed by the Tay and its affluents, westerly and south-westerly in\r\nthe district lying east of Loch Linnhe.[C] Thus, a line drawn from Ben\r\nNevis through the Cairngorm and Ben Muich Dhui Mountains to Kinnaird\r\nPoint passes through the highest land in the South-east Highlands, and\r\nprobably indicates approximately the dominant portion of the ancient\r\nplateau. North of that line the drainage is towards the Moray Firth;\r\neast of it the rivers discharge to the North Sea; while an irregular\r\nwinding line, drawn from Ben Nevis eastward through the Moor of Rannoch\r\nand southward to Ben Lomond, forms the water-parting between the North\r\nSea and the Atlantic, and doubtless marks another dominant area of the\r\nold table-land.\r\n\r\n[C] The geological reader hardly requires to be reminded that many\r\nof the minor streams would have their courses determined, or greatly\r\nmodified, by the geological structure of the ground. Thus, such\r\nstreams often flow along the \"strike\" and other \"lines of weakness,\"\r\nand similar causes, doubtless, influenced the main rivers during the\r\ngradual excavation of their valleys.\r\n\r\nThat the valleys which discharge their water-flow north and east\r\nto the Moray Firth and the North Sea have been excavated by rivers\r\nand the allied agents of erosion, is sufficiently evident. All the\r\nlarge rivers of that wide region are typical. They show the orthodox\r\nthree courses--namely, a torrential or mountain-track, a middle or\r\nvalley-track, and a lower or plain-track. The same is the case with\r\nsome of the rivers that flow east from the great north-and-south\r\nwater-parting of the North-west Highlands, as, for example, those that\r\nenter the heads of Beauly Firth, Cromarty Firth, and Dornoch Firth.\r\nThose, however, which descend to Loch Lochy and Loch Linnhe, and the\r\nsea-lochs of Argyllshire, have no lower or plain-track. When we\r\ncross the north-and-south water-parting of the North-west Highlands,\r\nwe find that many of the streams are destitute of even a middle or\r\nvalley-track. The majority are mere mountain-torrents when they reach\r\nthe sea. Again, on the eastern watershed of the same region, a large\r\nnumber of the valleys contain lakes in their upper and middle reaches,\r\nand this is the case also with not a few of the valleys that open upon\r\nthe Atlantic. More frequently, however, the waters flowing west pass\r\nthrough no lakes, but enter the sea at the heads of long sea-lochs or\r\nfiords. This striking contrast between the east and west is not due to\r\nany difference in the origin of the valleys. The western valleys are as\r\nmuch the result of erosion as those of the east. The present contrast,\r\nin fact, is more apparent than real, and arises from the fact that\r\nthe land area on the Atlantic side has been greatly reduced in extent\r\nby subsidence. The western fiords are merely submerged land-valleys.\r\nFormerly the Inner and Outer Hebrides were united to themselves and the\r\nmainland, the country of which they formed a part stretching west into\r\nthe Atlantic, as far probably as the present 100 fathoms line. Were\r\nthat drowned land to be re-elevated, each of the great sea-lochs would\r\nappear as a deep mountain-valley containing one or more lake-basins of\r\nprecisely the same character as those that occur in so many valleys\r\non the eastern watershed. Thus we must consider all the islands lying\r\noff the west coast of the Highlands, including the major portions of\r\nArran and Bute, as forming part and parcel of the Highland division of\r\nScotland. The presence of the sea is a mere accident; the old lands\r\nnow submerged were above its level during a very recent geological\r\nperiod--a period well within the lifetime of the existing fauna and\r\nflora.\r\n\r\nThe old table-land of which the Highlands and Islands are the denuded\r\nand unsubmerged relics, is of vast geological antiquity. It was\r\ncertainly in existence, and had even undergone very considerable\r\nerosion, before the Old Red Sandstone period, as is proved by the\r\nfact that large tracts of the Old Red Sandstone formation are found\r\noccupying hollows in its surface. Glenmore had already been excavated\r\nwhen the conglomerates of the Old Red Sandstone began to be laid\r\ndown. Some of the low-lying maritime tracts of the Highland area in\r\nCaithness, and the borders of the Moray Firth, are covered with the\r\nsandstones of that age; and there is evidence to show that these\r\nstrata formerly extended over wide regions, from which they have since\r\nbeen removed by erosion. The fact that the Old Red Sandstone deposits\r\nstill occupy such extensive areas in the north-east of the mainland,\r\nand in Orkney, shows that the old table-land shelved away gradually\r\nto north and east, and the same conclusion may be drawn, as we have\r\nseen, from the direction followed by the main lines of the existing\r\ndrainage-system. We see, in short, in the table-land of the Highlands,\r\none of the oldest elevated regions of Europe--a region which has been\r\nagain and again submerged either in whole or in part, and covered with\r\nthe deposits of ancient seas and lakes, only to be re-elevated, time\r\nafter time, and thus to have those deposits in large measure swept away\r\nfrom its surface by the long-continued action of running water and\r\nother agents of denudation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Central Lowlands.--The belt of low-lying ground that separates the\r\nHighlands from the Southern Uplands is, as we have seen, very well\r\ndefined. In many places the Uplands rise along its southern margin as\r\nabruptly as the Highlands in the north. The southern margin coincides,\r\nin fact, for a considerable distance (from Girvan to the base of the\r\nMoorfoots) with a great fracture that runs in the same direction as the\r\nbounding fracture or fault of the Highlands. The Central Lowlands may\r\nbe described, in a word, as a broad depression between two table-lands.\r\nA glance at the map will show that the principal features of the\r\nLowlands have a north-easterly trend--the same trend, in fact, as the\r\nbounding lines of the division. To this arrangement there are some\r\nexceptions, the principal being the belt of hilly ground that extends\r\nfrom the neighbourhood of Paisley, south-east through the borders of\r\nRenfrewshire and Ayrshire, to the vicinity of Muirkirk. The major part\r\nof the Lowlands is under 500 feet in height, but some considerable\r\nportions exceed an elevation of 1000 feet, while here and there the\r\nhills approach a height of 2000 feet--the two highest points (2352 and\r\n2335 feet) being attained in Ben Cleugh, one of the Ochils, and in\r\nTinto. Probably the average elevation of the Lowland division does not\r\nexceed 350 or 400 feet. Speaking generally, the belts of hilly ground,\r\nand the more or less isolated prominences, are formed of more durable\r\nrocks than are met with in the adjacent lower-lying tracts. Thus the\r\nSidlaws, the Ochil Hills, and the heights in Renfrewshire and Ayrshire,\r\nare composed chiefly of more or less hard and tough volcanic rocks; and\r\nwhen sandstones enter into the formation of a line of hills, as in the\r\nSidlaws, they generally owe their preservation to the presence of the\r\nvolcanic rocks with which they are associated. This is well illustrated\r\nby the Lomond Hills in Fifeshire, the basal and larger portion of which\r\nconsists chiefly of somewhat soft sandstones, which have been protected\r\nfrom erosion by an overlying sheet of hard basalt-rock. All the\r\nisolated hills in the basin of the Forth are formed of knobs, bosses,\r\nand sheets of various kinds of igneous rock, which are more durable\r\nthan the sandstones, shales, and other sedimentary strata by which they\r\nare surrounded. Hence it is very evident that the configuration of the\r\nLowland tracts of Central Scotland is due to denudation. The softer\r\nand more readily disintegrated rocks have been worn away to a greater\r\nextent than the harder and less yielding masses.\r\n\r\nOnly in a few cases do the slopes of the hill-belts coincide with folds\r\nof the strata. Thus, the northern flanks of the Sidlaws and the Ochils\r\nslope towards the north-west, and this also is the general inclination\r\nof the old lavas and other rocks of which those hills are composed.\r\nThe southern flanks of the same hill-belt slope in Fifeshire towards\r\nthe south-east--this being also the dip or inclination of the rocks.\r\nThe crest of the Ochils coincides, therefore, more or less closely,\r\nwith an anticlinal arch or fold of the strata. But when we follow the\r\naxis of this arch towards the north-east into the Sidlaws, we find it\r\nbroken through by the Tay valley--the axial line running down through\r\nthe Carse of Gowrie to the north of Dundee. From the fact that many\r\nsimilar anticlinal axes occur throughout the Lowlands, which yet give\r\nrise to no corresponding features at the surface, we may conclude that\r\nthe partial preservation of the anticline of the Ochils and Sidlaws is\r\nsimply owing to the greater durability of the materials of which those\r\nhills consist. Had the arch been composed of sandstones and shales it\r\nwould most probably have given rise to no such prominent features as\r\nare now visible.\r\n\r\nAnother hilly belt, which at first sight appears to correspond roughly\r\nto an anticlinal axis, is that broad tract of igneous rocks which\r\nseparates the Kilmarnock coal-field from the coal-fields of the Clyde\r\nbasin. But although the old lavas of that hilly tract slope north-east\r\nand south-west, with the same general inclination as the surface, yet\r\nexamination shows that the hills do not form a true anticline. They\r\nare built up of a great variety of ancient lavas and fragmental tuffs\r\nor \"ashes,\" which are inclined in many different directions. In short,\r\nwe have in those hills the degraded and sorely denuded fragments of an\r\nancient volcanic bank, formed by eruptions that began upon the bottom\r\nof a shallow sea in early Carboniferous times, and subsequently became\r\nsub-aërial. And there is evidence to show that after the eruptions\r\nceased the volcanic bank was slowly submerged, and eventually buried\r\nbeneath the accumulating sediments of later Carboniferous times.\r\nThe exposure of the ancient volcanic bank at the surface has been\r\naccomplished by the denudation of the stratified masses which formerly\r\ncovered it, and its existence as a dominant elevation at the present\r\nday is solely due to the fact that it is built up of more resistant\r\nmaterials than occur in the adjacent low-lying areas. The Ochils and\r\nthe Sidlaws are of greater antiquity, but have a somewhat similar\r\nhistory. Into this, however, it is not necessary to go.\r\n\r\nThe principal hills of the Lowlands form two interrupted belts,\r\nextending north-east and south-west, one of them, which we may call the\r\nNorthern Heights, facing the Highlands, and the other, which may in\r\nlike manner be termed the Southern Heights, flanking the great Uplands\r\nof the south. The former of these two belts is represented by the\r\nGarvock Hills, lying between Stonehaven and the valley of the North\r\nEsk; the Sidlaws, extending from the neighbourhood of Montrose to the\r\nvalley of the Tay at Perth; the Ochil Hills, stretching along the south\r\nside of the Firth of Tay to the valley of the Forth at Bridge-of-Allan;\r\nthe Lennox Hills, ranging from the neighbourhood of Stirling to\r\nDumbarton; the Kilbarchan Hills, lying between Greenock and Ardrossan;\r\nthe Cumbrae Islands and the southern half of Arran; and the same line\r\nof heights reappears in the south end of Kintyre. A well-marked hollow,\r\ntrough, or undulating plain of variable width, separates these Northern\r\nHeights from the Highlands, and may be followed all the way from near\r\nStonehaven, through Strathmore, to Crieff and Auchterarder. Between the\r\nvalleys of the Earn and Teith this plain attains an abnormal height\r\n(the Braes of Doune); but from the Teith, south-west by Flanders\r\nMoss and the lower end of Loch Lomond to the Clyde at Helensburgh,\r\nit resumes its characteristic features. It will be observed also\r\nthat a hollow separates the southern portion of Arran from the much\r\nloftier northern or Highland area. The tract known as the Braes of\r\nDoune, extending from Glen Artney south-east to Strath Allan, although\r\nabutting upon the Highlands, is clearly marked off from that great\r\ndivision by geological composition and structure, by elevation and\r\nconfiguration. It is simply a less deeply eroded portion of the long\r\ntrough or hollow.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the Southern Heights of the Lowlands, we find that these\r\nform a still more interrupted belt than the Northern Heights, and that\r\nthey are less clearly separated by an intermediate depression from the\r\ngreat Uplands which they flank. They begin in the north-east with the\r\nisolated Garleton Hills, between which and the Lammermoors a narrow\r\nlow-lying trough or hollow appears. A considerable width of low ground\r\nnow intervenes before we reach the Pentland Hills, which are in like\r\nmanner separated from the Southern Uplands by a broad low-lying tract.\r\nAt their southern extremity, however, the Pentlands merge more or less\r\ngradually into a somewhat broken and interrupted group of hills which\r\nabut abruptly on the Southern Uplands, in the same manner as the\r\nBraes of Doune abut upon the slate hills of the Highland borders. In\r\nthis region the greatest heights reached are in Tinto (2335 feet), and\r\nCairntable (1844 feet), and, at the same time, the hills broaden out\r\ntowards north-west, where they are continued by the belt of volcanic\r\nrocks already described as extending between the coal-fields of the\r\nClyde and Kilmarnock. Although the Southern Heights abut so closely\r\nupon the Uplands lying to the south, there is no difficulty in drawing\r\na firm line of demarcation between the two areas--geologically and\r\nphysically they are readily distinguished. No one with any eye for\r\nform, no matter how ignorant he may be of geology, can fail to see\r\nhow strongly contrasted are such hills as Tinto and Cairntable with\r\nthose of the Uplands, which they face. The Southern Heights are again\r\ninterrupted towards the south-east by the valleys of the Ayr and the\r\nDoon, but they reappear in the hills that extend from the Heads of Ayr\r\nto the valley of the Girvan.\r\n\r\nBetwixt the Northern and Southern Heights spread the broad Lowland\r\ntracts that drain towards the Forth, together with the lower reaches\r\nof the Clyde valley, and the wide moors that form the water-parting\r\nbetween that river and the estuary of the Forth. The hills that occur\r\nwithin this inner region of the Central Lowlands are usually more or\r\nless isolated, and are invariably formed by outcrops of igneous rock.\r\nTheir outline and general aspect vary according to the geological\r\ncharacter of the rocks of which they are composed--some forming more\r\nor less prominent escarpments like those of the Bathgate Hills and the\r\nheights behind Burntisland and Kinghorn, others showing a soft rounded\r\ncontour like the Saline Hills in the west of Fifeshire. Of the same\r\ngeneral character as this inner Lowland region is the similar tract\r\nwatered by the Irvine, the Ayr, and the Doon. This tract, as we have\r\nseen, is separated from the larger inner region lying to the east by\r\nthe volcanic hills that extend from the Southern Heights north-west\r\ninto Renfrewshire.\r\n\r\nThe largest rivers that traverse the Central Lowlands take their rise,\r\nas might be expected, in the mountainous table-lands to the north and\r\nsouth. Of these the principal are the North and South Esks, the Tay\r\nand the Isla, the Earn, and the Forth, all of which, with numerous\r\ntributaries, descend from the Highlands. And it will be observed\r\nthat they have breached the line of the Northern Heights in three\r\nplaces--namely, in the neighbourhood of Montrose, Perth, and Stirling.\r\n\r\nThe only streams of importance coming north from the Southern Uplands\r\nare the Clyde and the Doon, both of which in like manner have broken\r\nthrough the Southern Heights. Now, just as the main water-flows of\r\nthe Highlands indicate the average slope of the ancient land-surface\r\nbefore it was trenched and furrowed by the innumerable valleys that\r\nnow intersect it, so the direction followed by the greater rivers that\r\ntraverse the Lowlands mark out the primeval slopes of that area. One\r\nsees at a glance, then, that the present configuration of this latter\r\ndivision has been brought about by the erosive action of the principal\r\nrivers and their countless affluents, aided by the sub-aërial agents\r\ngenerally--rain, frost, ice, etc. The hills rise above the average\r\nlevel of the ground, not because they have been ridged up from below,\r\nbut simply owing to the more durable nature of their component rocks.\r\nThat the Northern and Southern Heights are breached only shows that the\r\nlow grounds, now separating those heights from the adjacent Highlands\r\nand Southern Uplands, formerly stood at a higher level, and so allowed\r\nthe rivers to make their way more or less directly to the sea. Thus,\r\nfor example, the long trough of Strathmore has been excavated out of\r\nsandstones, the upper surface of which once reached a much greater\r\nheight, and sloped outwards from the Highlands across what is now the\r\nridge of the Sidlaw Hills. Here then, in the Central Lowlands, as in\r\nthe Highlands, true mountain- or hill-ranges are absent. But if we\r\nare permitted to term any well-marked line or belt of high ground a\r\n\"range,\" then the Northern and Southern Heights of the Lowlands are\r\nbetter entitled to be so designated than any series of mountains in the\r\nHighlands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Southern Uplands.--The northern margin of this wide division having\r\nalready been defined, we may now proceed to examine the distribution\r\nof its mountain-masses. Before doing so, however, it may be as well\r\nto point out that considerable tracts in Tweeddale, Teviotdale, and\r\nLiddesdale, together with the Cheviot Hills, do not properly belong\r\nto the Southern Uplands. In fact, the Cheviots bear the same relation\r\nto those Uplands as the Northern Heights do to the Highlands. Like\r\nthem they are separated by a broad hollow from the Uplands, which they\r\nface--a hollow that reaches its greatest extent in Tweeddale, and\r\nrapidly wedges out to south-west, where the Cheviots abut abruptly\r\non the Uplands. Even where this abrupt contact takes place, however,\r\nthe different configuration of the two regions would enable any\r\ngeologist to separate the one set of mountains from the other. But for\r\ngeographical purposes we may conveniently disregard these geological\r\ncontrasts, and include within the Southern Uplands all the area lying\r\nbetween the Central Lowlands and the English Border.\r\n\r\nIf there are no mountains in the Highlands so grouped and arranged as\r\nto be properly termed \"ranges,\" this is not less true of the Southern\r\nUplands. Perhaps it is the appearance which those Uplands present when\r\nviewed from the Central Lowlands that first suggested the notion that\r\nthey were ranges. They seem to rise like a wall out of the low grounds\r\nat their base, and extend far as eye can reach in an approximately\r\nstraight line. It seems more probable, however, that our earlier\r\ncartographers merely meant, by their conventional hill-shading, to mark\r\nout definitely the water-partings. But to do so in this manner now,\r\nwhen the large contour maps of the Ordnance Survey may be in any one's\r\nhands, is inexcusable. A study of those maps, or, better still, a visit\r\nto the tops of a few of the dominant points in the area under review,\r\nwill effectually dispel the idea that the Southern Uplands consist of a\r\nseries of ridges zigzagging across the country. Like the Highlands, the\r\narea of the Southern Uplands is simply an old table-land, furrowed into\r\nravine and valley by the operation of the various agents of erosion.\r\n\r\nBeginning our survey of these Uplands in the east, we encounter\r\nfirst the Lammermoor Hills--a broad undulating plateau--the highest\r\nelevations of which do not reach 2000 feet. West of this come the\r\nMoorfoot Hills and the high grounds lying between the Gala and the\r\nTweed--a tract which averages a somewhat higher elevation--two points\r\nexceeding 2000 feet in height. The next group of mountains we meet\r\nis that of the Moffat Hills, in which head a number of important\r\nrivers--the Tweed, the Yarrow, the Ettrick, and the Annan. Many points\r\nin this region exceed 2000 feet, others approach 2500 feet; and some\r\nreach nearly 3000 feet, such as Broad Law (2754 feet), and Dollar\r\nLaw (2680 feet). In the south-west comes the group of the Lowthers,\r\nwith dominant elevations of more than 2000 feet. Then follow the\r\nmountain-masses in which the Nith, the Ken, the Cree, the Doon, and\r\nthe Girvan take their rise, many of the heights exceeding 2000 feet,\r\nand a number reaching and even passing 2500 feet, the dominant point\r\nbeing reached in the noble mountain-mass of the Merrick (2764 feet).\r\nIn the extreme south-west the Uplands terminate in a broad undulating\r\nplateau, of which the highest point is but little over 1000 feet. All\r\nthe mountain-groups now referred to are massed along the northern\r\nborders of the Southern Uplands. In the south-west the general surface\r\nfalls more or less gradually away towards the Solway--the 500 feet\r\ncontour line being reached at fifteen miles, upon an average, from\r\nthe sea-coast. In the extreme north-east the high grounds descend in\r\nlike manner into the rich low grounds of the Merse. Between these low\r\ngrounds and Annandale, however, the Uplands merge, as it were, into the\r\nbroad elevated moory tract that extends south-east, to unite with the\r\nCheviots--a belt of hills rising along the English Border to heights of\r\n1964 feet (Peel Fell), and 2676 feet (the Cheviot).\r\n\r\nThe general configuration of the main mass of the Southern\r\nUplands--that is to say, the mountain-groups extending along the\r\nnorthern portion of the area under review, from Loch Ryan to the coast\r\nbetween Dunbar and St. Abb's Head--is somewhat tame and monotonous. The\r\nmountains are flat-topped elevations, with broad, rounded shoulders\r\nand smooth grassy slopes. Standing on the summits of the Higher hills,\r\none seems to be in the midst of a wide, gently undulating plain, the\r\nsurface of which is not broken by the appearance of any isolated peaks\r\nor eminences. Struggling across the bogs and peat-mosses that cover\r\nso many of those flat-topped mountains, the wanderer ever and anon\r\nsuddenly finds himself on the brink of a deep green dale. He discovers,\r\nin short, that he is traversing an elevated undulating table-land,\r\nintersected by narrow and broad trench-like valleys that radiate\r\noutwards in all directions from the dominant bosses and swellings of\r\nthe plateau. The mountains, therefore, are merely broad ridges and\r\nbanks separating contiguous valleys; in a word, they are, like the\r\nmountains of the Highlands, monuments of erosion, which do not run in\r\nlinear directions, but form irregular groups and masses.\r\n\r\nThe rocks that enter into the formation of this portion of the Southern\r\nUplands have much the same character throughout. Consequently there\r\nis less variety of contour and colour than in the Highlands. The\r\nhills are not only flatter atop, but are much smoother in outline,\r\nthere being a general absence of those beetling crags and precipices\r\nwhich are so common in the Highland regions. Now and again, however,\r\nthe mountains assume a rougher aspect. This is especially the case\r\nwith those of Carrick and Galloway, amongst which we encounter a\r\nwildness and grandeur which are in striking contrast to the gentle\r\npastoral character of the Lowthers and similar tracts extending along\r\nthe northern and higher parts of the Southern Uplands. Descending to\r\ndetails, the geologist can observe also modifications of contour even\r\namong those monotonous rounded hills. Such modifications are due to\r\ndifferences in the character of the component rocks, but they are\r\nrarely so striking as the modifications that arise from the same cause\r\nin the Highlands. To the trained eye, however, they are sufficiently\r\nmanifest, and upon a geologically coloured map, which shows the\r\nvarious belts of rock that traverse the Uplands from south-west to\r\nnorth-east, it will be found that the mountains occurring within\r\neach of those separate belts have certain distinctive features. Such\r\nfeatures, however, cannot be depicted upon a small orographical map.\r\nThe separation of those mountains into distinct ranges, by reference\r\nto their physical aspect, is even less possible here than in the\r\nHighlands. Now and again, bands of certain rocks, which are of a\r\nmore durable character than the other strata in their neighbourhood,\r\ngive rise to pronounced ridges and banks, while hollows and valleys\r\noccasionally coincide more or less closely with the outcrops of the\r\nmore readily eroded strata; but such features are mere minor details\r\nin the general configuration of the country. The courses of brooks\r\nand streams may have been frequently determined by the nature and\r\narrangement of the rocks, but the general slope of the Uplands and the\r\ndirection of the main lines of water-flow are at right angles to the\r\ntrend of the strata, and cannot therefore have been determined in that\r\nway. The strata generally are inclined at high angles--they occur, in\r\nshort, as a series of great anticlinal arches and synclinal curves, but\r\nthe tops of the grand folds have been planed off, and the axes of the\r\nsynclinal troughs, so far from coinciding with valleys, very often run\r\nalong the tops of the highest hills. The foldings and plications do\r\nnot, in a word, produce any corresponding undulations of the surface.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the elevated moory tracts that serve to\r\nconnect the Cheviots with the loftier Uplands lying to north-west.\r\nThe configuration of these moors is tamer even than that of the\r\nregions just described, but the same general form prevails from\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Moffat Hills to the head-waters of the\r\nTeviot. There, however, other varieties of rock appear, and produce\r\ncorresponding changes in the aspect of the high grounds. Not a few of\r\nthe hills in this district stand out prominently. They are more or less\r\npyramidal and conical in shape, being built up of sandstones often\r\ncrowned atop with a capping of some crystalline igneous rock, such as\r\nbasalt. The Maiden Paps, Leap Hill, Needs Law, and others are examples.\r\nThe heights draining towards Liddesdale and lower reaches of Eskdale,\r\ncomposed chiefly of sandstones, with here and there intercalated\r\nsheets of harder igneous rock, frequently show escarpments and\r\nterraced outlines, but have a general undulating contour; and similar\r\nfeatures are characteristic of the sandstone mountains that form the\r\nsouth-west portion of the Cheviots. Towards the north-east, however,\r\nthe sandstones give place to various igneous rocks, so that the hills\r\nin the north-east section of the Cheviots differ very much in aspect\r\nand configuration from those at the other extremity of the belt. They\r\nhave a more varied and broken outline, closely resembling many parts of\r\nthe Ochils and other portions of the Northern and Southern Heights of\r\nthe Central Lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe low-lying tracts of Roxburghshire and the Merse, in like manner,\r\npresent features which are common to the inner region of the Central\r\nLowlands. Occasional ridges of hills rise above the general level of\r\nthe land, as at Smailholm and Stitchell to the north of Kelso, while\r\nisolated knolls and prominences--some bald and abrupt, others smooth\r\nand rounded--help to diversify the surface. Bonchester Hill, Rubers\r\nLaw, the Dunian, Penielheugh, Minto Hills, and the Eildons may be\r\nmentioned as examples. All of these are of igneous origin, some being\r\nmere caps of basalt resting upon a foundation of sandstone, while\r\nothers are the stumps of isolated volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIn the maritime tracts of Galloway the low grounds repeat, on a smaller\r\nscale, the configuration of the lofty Uplands behind, for they are\r\ncomposed of the same kinds of rock. Their most remarkable feature is\r\nthe heavy mountain-mass of Criffel, rising near the mouth of the Nith\r\nto a height of 1800 feet.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, therefore, throughout the region of the Southern Uplands,\r\nin hilly and low-lying tracts alike, we see that the land has been\r\nmodelled and contoured by the agents of erosion. We are dealing, as\r\nin the Highlands, with an old table-land, in which valleys have been\r\nexcavated by running water and its helpmates. Nowhere do we encounter\r\nany linear banks, ridges, or ranges as we find described in the\r\nclass-books, and represented upon many general maps of the country.\r\nIn one of those manuals we read that in the southern district \"the\r\nprincipal range of mountains is that known as the Lowther Hills, which\r\nsprings off from the Cheviots, and, running in a zigzag direction to\r\nthe south-west, terminates on the west coast near Loch Ryan.\" This\r\nis quite true, according to many common maps, but unfortunately the\r\n\"range\" exists upon those maps and nowhere else. The zigzag line\r\ndescribed is not a range of mountains, but a water-parting, which is\r\nquite another matter.\r\n\r\nThe table-land of the Southern Uplands, like that of the Highlands, is\r\nof immense antiquity. Long before the Old Red Sandstone period, it had\r\nbeen furrowed and trenched by running water. Of the original contour of\r\nits surface, all we can say is that it formed an undulating plateau,\r\nthe general slope of which was towards south-east. This is shown by the\r\ntrend of the more important rivers, such as the Nith and the Annan,\r\nthe Gala and the Leader; and by the distribution of the various strata\r\npertaining to the Old Red Sandstone and later geological periods. Thus,\r\nstrata of Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous age occupy the Merse\r\nand the lower reaches of Teviotdale, and extend up the valleys of the\r\nWhiteadder and the Leader into the heart of the Silurian Uplands.\r\nIn like manner Permian sandstones are well developed in the ancient\r\nhollows of Annandale and Nithsdale. Along the northern borders of the\r\nSouthern Uplands we meet with similar evidence to show that even as\r\nearly as Old Red Sandstone times the old plateau, along what is now its\r\nnorthern margin, was penetrated by valleys that drained towards the\r\nnorth. The main drainage, however, then as now, was directed towards\r\nsouth-east.\r\n\r\nMany geological facts conspire to show that the Silurian table-land of\r\nthese Uplands has been submerged, like the Highlands, in whole or in\r\npart. This happened at various periods, and each time the land went\r\ndown it received a covering of newer accumulations--patches of which\r\nstill remain to testify to the former extent of the submergences. From\r\nthe higher portions of the Uplands those accumulations have been almost\r\nwholly swept away, but they have not been entirely cleared out of the\r\nancient valleys. They still mantle the borders of the Silurian area,\r\nparticularly in the north-east, where they attain a great thickness\r\nin the moors of Liddesdale and the Cheviot Hills. The details of the\r\nevolution of the whole area of the Southern Uplands form an interesting\r\nstudy, but this pertains rather to Geology than to Physical Geography.\r\nIt is enough, from our present point of view, to be assured that the\r\nmain features of the country were chalked out, as it were, at a very\r\ndistant geological period, and that all the infinite variety in the\r\nrelief of our land has been brought about directly, not by titanic\r\nconvulsions and earth-movements, but by the long-continued working of\r\nrain and rivers--of frost and snow and ice, supplemented from time to\r\ntime by the action of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe physical features more particularly referred to in this paper are\r\nof course only the bolder and more prominent contours--those namely\r\nwhich can be expressed with sufficient accuracy upon sheets of such\r\na size as the accompanying orographical map of Scotland (Plate I.).\r\nWith larger maps considerably more detail can be added, and many\r\ncharacteristic and distinguishing features will appear according to\r\nthe care with which such maps are drawn. In the case of the Ordnance\r\nSurvey map, on the scale of 1 inch to a mile, the varying forms of the\r\nsurface are so faithfully delineated as frequently to indicate to a\r\ntrained observer the nature of the rocks and the geological structure\r\nof the ground. The artists who sketched the hills must indeed have had\r\ngood eyes for form. So carefully has their work been done, that it is\r\noften not difficult to distinguish upon their maps hills formed of such\r\nrocks as sandstone from those that are composed of more durable kinds.\r\nThe individual characteristics of mountains of schist, of granite, of\r\nquartz-rock, of slate, are often well depicted: nay, even the varieties\r\nof igneous rock which enter into the formation of the numerous hills\r\nand knolls of the Lowlands can frequently be detected by the features\r\nwhich the artists have so intelligently caught. Another set of features\r\nwhich their maps display are those due to glaciation. These are\r\nadmirably brought out, even down to the smallest details. A glance at\r\nsuch maps as those of Teviotdale and the Merse, for example, shows at\r\nonce the direction taken by the old _mer de glace_. The long parallel\r\nflutings of the hill-slopes, _roches moutonnées_, projecting knolls and\r\nhills with their \"tails,\" the great series of banks and ridges of stony\r\nclay which trend down the valley of the Tweed--these, and many more\r\ndetails of interest to specialists, are shown upon the maps. All over\r\nScotland similar phenomena are common, and have been reproduced with\r\nmarvellous skill on the shaded sheets issued by the Ordnance Survey.\r\nAnd yet the artists were not geologists. The present writer is glad\r\nof this opportunity of recording his obligations to those gentlemen.\r\nTheir faithful delineations of physical features have given him many\r\nvaluable suggestions, and have led up to certain observations which\r\nmight otherwise not have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMountains: Their Origin, Growth, and Decay.[D]\r\n\r\n[D] _Scottish Geographical Magazine_, vol. ii., 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nMountains have long had a fascination for lovers of nature. Time was,\r\nhowever, when most civilised folk looked upon them with feelings akin\r\nto horror; and good people, indeed, have written books to show that\r\nthey are the cursed places of the earth--the ruin and desolation of\r\ntheir gorges and defiles affording indubitable proof of the evils\r\nwhich befell the world when man lapsed from his primitive state of\r\ninnocence and purity. All this has changed. It is the fashion now to\r\noffer a kind of worship to mountains; and every year their solitudes\r\nare invaded by devotees--some, according to worthy Meg Dods, \"rinning\r\nup hill and down dale, knapping the chuckie-stanes to pieces wi'\r\nhammers, like sae mony roadmakers run daft--to see, as they say, how\r\nthe warld was made\"--others trying to transfer some of the beauty\r\naround them to paper or canvas--yet others, and these perhaps not the\r\nleast wise, content, as old Sir Thomas Browne has it, \"to stare about\r\nwith a gross rusticity,\" and humbly thankful that they are beyond the\r\nreach of telegrams, and see nothing to remind them of the _fumun et\r\nopes strepitumque Romæ_. But if the sentiment with which mountains are\r\nregarded has greatly changed, so likewise have the views of scientific\r\nmen as to their origin and history. Years ago no one doubted that all\r\nmountains were simply the result of titanic convulsions. The crust of\r\nthe earth had been pushed up from below, tossed into great billows,\r\nshivered and shattered--the mountains corresponding to the crests of\r\nhuge earth-waves, the valleys to the intervening depressions, or to\r\ngaping fractures and dislocations. This view of the origin of mountains\r\nhas always appeared reasonable to those who do not know what is meant\r\nby geological structure, and in some cases it is pretty near the\r\ntruth. A true mountain-chain, like that of the Alps, does indeed owe\r\nits origin to gigantic disturbances of the earth's crust, and in such\r\na region the larger features of the surface often correspond more or\r\nless closely with the inclination of the underlying rocks. But in many\r\nelevated tracts, composed of highly disturbed and convoluted strata,\r\nno such coincidence of surface-features and underground structure can\r\nbe traced. The mountains do not correspond to great swellings of the\r\ncrust--the valleys neither lie in trough-shaped strata, nor do they\r\ncoincide with gaping fractures. Again, many considerable mountains are\r\nbuilt up of rocks which have not been convoluted at all, but occur in\r\napproximately horizontal beds. Evidently, therefore, some force other\r\nthan subterranean action must be called upon to explain the origin of\r\nmany of the most striking surface-features of the land.\r\n\r\nEvery geologist admits--it is one of the truisms of his science--that\r\ncorrugations and plications are the result of subterranean action. Nor\r\ndoes any one deny that when a true mountain-chain was first upheaved\r\nthe greater undulations of the folded strata probably gave rise to\r\nsimilar undulations at the surface. Some of the larger fractures and\r\ndislocations might also have appeared at the surface and produced\r\nmural precipices. So long a time, however, has elapsed since the\r\nelevation of even the youngest mountain-chains of the globe that the\r\nsub-aërial agents of erosion--rain, frost, rivers, glaciers, etc.--have\r\nbeen enabled greatly to modify their primeval features. For these\r\nmountains, therefore, it is only partially true that their present\r\nslopes coincide with those of the underlying strata. Such being the\r\ncase with so young a chain as the Alps, we need not be surprised to\r\nmeet with modifications on a still grander scale in mountain-regions of\r\nmuch greater antiquity. In many such tracts the primeval configuration\r\ndue to subterranean action has been entirely remodelled, so that\r\nhills now stand where deep hollows formerly existed, while valleys\r\nfrequently have replaced mountains. And this newer configuration is the\r\ndirect result of erosion, guided by the mineralogical composition and\r\nstructural peculiarities of the rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, or even impossible, for one who is ignorant of\r\ngeological structure to realise that the apparently insignificant\r\nagents of erosion have played so important a _rôle_ in the evolution\r\nof notable earth-features. It may be well, therefore, to illustrate\r\nthe matter by reference to one or two regions where the geological\r\nstructure is too simple to be misunderstood. The first examples I shall\r\ngive are from tracts of horizontal strata. Many readers are doubtless\r\naware of the fact that our rock-masses consist for the most part of the\r\nmore or less indurated and compacted sediments of former rivers, lakes,\r\nand seas. Frequently those ancient water-formed rocks have been very\r\nmuch altered, so as even sometimes to acquire a crystalline character.\r\nBut it is enough for us now to remember that the crust of the globe, so\r\nfar as that is accessible to observation, is built up mostly of rocks\r\nwhich were originally accumulated as aqueous sediments. Such being the\r\ncase, it is obvious that our strata of sandstone, conglomerate, shale,\r\nlimestone, etc., must at first have been spread out in approximately\r\nhorizontal or gently inclined sheets or layers. We judge so from what\r\nwe know of sediments which are accumulating at present. The wide\r\nflats of our river valleys, the broad plains that occupy the sites of\r\nsilted-up lakes, the extensive deltas of such rivers as the Nile and\r\nthe Po, the narrow and wide belts of low-lying land which within a\r\nrecent period have been gained from the sea, are all made up of various\r\nkinds of sediment arranged in approximately horizontal layers. Now,\r\nover wide regions of the earth's surface the sedimentary strata still\r\nlie horizontally, and we can often tell at what geological period they\r\nbecame converted into dry land. Thus, for example, we know that the\r\nelevated plateau through which the river Colorado flows is built up\r\nof a great series of nearly horizontal beds of various sedimentary\r\ndeposits, which reach a thickness of many thousand feet. It is\r\nself-evident that the youngest strata must be those which occur at the\r\nsurface of the plateau, and they, as we know, are of lacustrine origin\r\nand belong to the Tertiary period. Now, American geologists have shown\r\nthat since that period several thousands of feet of rock-materials have\r\nbeen removed from the surface of that plateau--the thickness of rock so\r\ncarried away amounting in some places to nearly 10,000 feet. Yet all\r\nthat prodigious erosion has been effected since early Tertiary times.\r\nIndeed, it can be proved that the excavation of the Grand Cañon of\r\nthe Colorado, probably the most remarkable river-trench in the world,\r\nhas been accomplished since the close of the Tertiary period, and is\r\ntherefore a work of more recent date than the last great upheaval\r\nof the Swiss Alps. The origin of the cañon is self-evident--it is a\r\nmagnificent example of river-erosion, and the mere statement of its\r\ndimensions gives one a forcible impression of the potency of sub-aërial\r\ndenudation. The river-cutting is about 300 miles long, 11 or 12 miles\r\nbroad, and varies from 3000 to 6000 feet in depth.\r\n\r\nTake another example of what denuding agents have done within a recent\r\ngeological period. The Faröe Islands, some twenty in number, extend\r\nover an area measuring about 70 miles from south to north, and nearly\r\n50 miles from west to east. These islands are composed of volcanic\r\nrocks--beds of basalt with intervening layers of fine fragmental\r\nmaterials, and are obviously the relics of what formerly was one\r\ncontinuous plateau, deeply trenched by valleys running in various\r\ndirections. Subsequent depression of the land introduced the sea to\r\nthese valleys, and the plateau was then converted into a group of\r\nislands, separated from each other by narrow sounds and fiords. Were\r\nthe great plateau through which the Colorado flows to be partially\r\nsubmerged, it would reproduce on a larger scale the general phenomena\r\npresented by this lonely island-group of the North Atlantic. The\r\nflat-topped \"buttes\" and \"mesas,\" and the pyramidal mountains of\r\nthe Colorado district would form islands comparable to those of the\r\nFaröes. Most of the latter attain a considerable elevation above the\r\nsea--heights of 1700, 2000, 2500, and 2850 feet being met with in\r\nseveral of the islands. Indeed, the average elevation of the land in\r\nthis northern archipelago can hardly be less than 900 feet. The deep\r\ntrench-like valleys are evidently only the upper reaches of valleys\r\nwhich began to be excavated when the islands formed part and parcel\r\nof one and the same plateau--the lower reaches being now occupied by\r\nfiords and sounds. It is quite certain that all these valleys are the\r\nwork of erosion. One can trace the beds of basalt continuously across\r\nthe bottoms, and be quite sure that the valleys are not gaping cracks\r\nor fractures. Now, as the strata are approximately horizontal, it is\r\nobvious that the hollows of the surface have nothing whatever to do\r\nwith undulations produced by earth-movements. The sub-aërial erosion\r\nof the islands has resulted in the development of massive flat-topped\r\nand pyramidal mountains. These stand up as eminences simply because the\r\nrock-material which once surrounded them has been gradually broken up\r\nand carried away. Nothing can well be more impressive to the student\r\nof physical geology than the aspect presented by these relics of\r\nan ancient plateau (Plate II. Fig. 1). Standing on some commanding\r\nelevation, such as Nakkin in Suderöe, one sees rising before him great\r\ntruncated pyramids--built up of horizontal beds of basalt rising tier\r\nabove tier--the mountains being separated from each other by wide and\r\nprofound hollows, across which the basalt-beds were once continuous.\r\nOwing to the parallel and undisturbed position of the strata, it is\r\nnot hard to form an estimate of the amount of material which has been\r\nremoved during the gradual excavation of the valleys. In order to do so\r\nwe have simply to measure the width, depth, and length of the valleys.\r\nThus in Suderöe, which is 19 miles long and 6 miles broad, the bottoms\r\nof the valleys are 1000 feet at least below the tops of the mountains,\r\nand some of the hollows in question are a mile in width. Now, the\r\namount of rock worn away from this one little island by sub-aërial\r\nerosion cannot be less than that of a mass measuring 10 miles in\r\nlength by 6 miles in breadth, and 800 feet in thickness. And yet the\r\nFaröe Islands are composed of rocks which had no existence when the\r\nsoft clays, etc., of the London Basin were being accumulated. All the\r\nerosion referred to has taken place since the great upheaval of the\r\nEocene strata of the Swiss Alps.\r\n\r\nBut if the evidence of erosion be so conspicuous in regions composed\r\nof horizontal strata, it is not less so in countries where the rocks\r\nare inclined at various angles to the horizon. Indeed, the very fact\r\nthat inclined strata crop out at the surface is sufficient evidence of\r\nerosion. For it is obvious that these outcrops are merely the truncated\r\nends of beds which must formerly have had a wider extension. But while\r\nthe effects produced by the erosion of horizontal strata are readily\r\nperceived by the least-informed observer, it requires some knowledge\r\nof geological structure to appreciate the denudation of curved or\r\nundulating strata. And yet there is really no mystery in the matter.\r\nAll we have to do is by careful observation to ascertain the mode of\r\narrangement of the rocks--this accomplished, we have no difficulty\r\nin estimating the minimum erosion which any set of strata may have\r\nexperienced. An illustration may serve to make this plain. Here, for\r\nexample, is a section across a region of undulating strata (Fig. 2).\r\nLet the line _A B_ represent the surface of the ground, and _C D_ be\r\nany datum line--say, the sea-level. An observer at _A_, who should\r\nwalk in the direction of _B_, would cross successively eight outcrops\r\nof coal; and, were he incapable of reading the geological structure\r\nof the ground, he might imagine that he had come upon eight separate\r\ncoal-seams. A glance at the section, however, shows that in reality he\r\nhad met with only two coals, and that the deceptive appearances, which\r\nmight be misread by an incautious observer, are simply the result of\r\ndenudation. In this case the tops of a series of curved or arched beds\r\nhave been removed (as at _E_), and, by protracting the lines of the\r\ntruncated beds until they meet, we can estimate the minimum amount of\r\nerosion they have sustained. Thus, if the strata between _o_ and _p_\r\nbe 300 feet thick, it is self-evident that a somewhat greater thickness\r\nof rock must have been removed from the top of the anticlinal arch or\r\n\"saddleback\" at _E_.\r\n\r\nAgain, let us draw a section across strata which have been fractured\r\nand dislocated, and we shall see how such fractures likewise enable us\r\nto estimate the minimum amount of erosion which certain regions have\r\nexperienced. In Fig. 3 we have a series of strata containing a bed of\r\nlimestone _L_, and a coal-seam _a_. The present surface of the ground\r\nis represented by the line _A B_. At _F_ the strata are traversed by a\r\nfault or dislocation--the beds being thrown down for say 500 feet on\r\nthe low side of the fault--so that the coal at _a^2_ occurs now at a\r\ndepth of 500 feet below its continuation at _a^1_. At the surface of\r\nthe ground there is no inequality of level--the beds overlying the coal\r\n(_a²_) having been removed by denudation. Were the missing rocks to\r\nbe replaced, they would occupy the space contained within the dotted\r\nlines above the present surface _A B_. Such dislocations are of common\r\noccurrence in our coal-fields, and it is not often that they give rise\r\nto any features at the surface. We may thus traverse many level or\r\ngently-undulating tracts, and be quite unconscious of the fact that\r\ngeologically we have frequently leaped up or dropped down for hundreds\r\nof feet in a single step. Nay, some Scottish streams and rivers flow\r\nacross dislocations by which the strata have been shifted up or down\r\nfor thousands of feet, and in some places one can have the satisfaction\r\nof sitting upon rocks which are geologically 3000 yards below or\r\nabove those on which he rests his feet. In other words, thousands of\r\nfeet of strata have been removed by denudation from the high sides of\r\nfaults. These, as I have said, often give rise to no feature at the\r\nsurface; but, occasionally, when \"soft\" rocks have been shifted by\r\ndislocations, and brought against \"hard\" rocks, the latter, by better\r\nresisting denudation than the former, cause a more or less well-marked\r\nfeature at the surface, and thus betray the presence of a fault to the\r\ngeologist. The phenomena presented by faults, therefore, are just as\r\neloquent of denudation as is the truncated appearance of our strata;\r\nand only after we have carefully examined the present extension and\r\nmutual relations of our rock-masses, their varied inclination, and\r\nthe size of the dislocations by which they are traversed, can we\r\nproperly appreciate the degree of erosion which they have sustained.\r\nBefore we are entitled to express any opinion as to the origin of\r\nthe surface-features of a country, we must first know its geological\r\nstructure. Until we have attained such knowledge, all our views as\r\nto the origin of mountains are of less value than the paper they are\r\nwritten upon.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the evidence of denudation which we find in our\r\ntruncated and dislocated rock-masses; there is yet another line of\r\nevidence which I may very shortly point out. As every one knows, there\r\nexist in this and many other countries enormous masses of igneous\r\nrocks, which have certainly been extruded from below. Now, some of\r\nthese rocks, such as granite, belong to what is called the _plutonic_\r\nclass of rocks; they are of deep-seated origin--that is to say, they\r\nnever were erupted at the surface, but cooled and consolidated at great\r\ndepths in the earth's crust. I need not go into any detail to show\r\nthat this is the case--it is a conclusion based upon incontrovertible\r\nfacts, and accepted by every practical geologist. When, therefore, we\r\nencounter at the actual surface of the earth great mountain-masses of\r\ngranite, we know that in such regions enormous denudation has taken\r\nplace. The granite appears at the surface simply because the thick\r\nrock-masses under which it solidified have been gradually removed by\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nThe facts which I have now briefly passed in review must convince us\r\nthat erosion is one of the most potent factors with which the geologist\r\nhas to deal. We have seen what it has been able to effect in certain\r\ntracts composed of strata which date back to a recent geological\r\nperiod, such as the plateau of the Colorado and the pyramidal mountains\r\nof the Faröe Islands. If in regions built up of strata so young as\r\nthe rocks of those tracts the amount of erosion be so great, we may\r\nwell expect to meet with evidence of much more extensive denudation in\r\nregions which have been subjected for enormously longer periods to the\r\naction of the eroding agents.\r\n\r\nThe study of geological structure, or the architecture of the earth's\r\ncrust, has enabled us to group all mountains under these three\r\nprincipal heads:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Mountains of Accumulation._\r\n  2. _Mountains of Elevation._\r\n  3. _Mountains of Circumdenudation._\r\n\r\n1. Mountains of Accumulation.--Volcanoes may be taken as the type\r\nof this class of mountains. These are, of course, formed by the\r\naccumulation of igneous materials around the focus or foci of eruption,\r\nand their mode of origin is so generally understood, and, indeed,\r\nso obvious, that I need do no more than mention them. Of course,\r\nthey are all subject to erosion, and many long-extinct volcanoes are\r\nhighly denuded. Some very ancient ones, as those of our own country,\r\nhave been so demolished that frequently all that remains are the now\r\nplugged-up pipes or flues through which the heated materials found a\r\npassage to the surface--all those materials, consisting of lavas and\r\nashes, having in many cases entirely disappeared. In former times\r\nvolcanic eruptions often took place along the line of an extensive\r\nfissure--the lava, instead of being extruded at one or more points,\r\nwelled-up and overflowed along the whole length of the fissure, so as\r\nto flood the surrounding regions. And this happening again and again,\r\nvast plateaux of igneous rock came to be built up, such as those of the\r\nRocky Mountains, Iceland, the Faröes, Antrim and Mull, Abyssinia and\r\nthe Deccan. These are called _plateaux of accumulation_ (see Fig. 1),\r\nand all of them are more or less highly denuded, so that in many cases\r\nthe plateaux have quite a mountainous appearance. Of course, plateaux\r\nof accumulation are not always formed of igneous rocks. Any area of\r\napproximately horizontal strata of aqueous origin, rising to a height\r\nof a thousand feet or more above the sea, would come under this class\r\nof plateau--the plateau of the Colorado being a good example. Although\r\nthat plateau is of recent origin, yet its surface, as we have seen,\r\nhas been profoundly modified by superficial erosion; and this is true\r\nto a greater extent of plateaux which have been much longer exposed\r\nto denudation. It is obvious that even mountains and plateaux of\r\naccumulation often owe many of their present features to the action of\r\nthe surface-agents of change.\r\n\r\n2. Mountains of Elevation.--We have seen that the strata which enter\r\nmost largely into the composition of the earth's crust, so far as that\r\nis open to observation, consist of rocks which must originally have\r\nbeen disposed in horizontal or approximately horizontal layers. But,\r\nas every one knows, the stratified rocks are not always horizontally\r\narranged. In Scotland they rarely are so. On the contrary, they are\r\ninclined at all angles from the horizon, and not infrequently they even\r\nstand on end. Moreover, they are often traversed by dislocations, large\r\nand small. No one doubts that these tilted and disturbed rocks are\r\nevidence of wide-spread earth-movements. And it has been long known to\r\ngeologists that such movements have happened again and again in this\r\nand many other countries where similar disturbed strata occur. Some of\r\nthese movements, resulting in the upheaval of enormous mountain-masses,\r\nhave taken place within comparatively recent geological times. Others\r\nagain date back to periods inconceivably remote. The Pyrenees, the\r\nAlps, the Caucasus, the Himalaya, which form the back-bone of Eurasia,\r\nare among the youngest mountains of the globe. The Highlands of\r\nScotland and Scandinavia are immeasurably more ancient; they are, in\r\npoint of fact, the oldest high grounds in Europe, nor are there any\r\nmountain-masses elsewhere which can be shown to be older. But while the\r\nAlps and other recent mountains of elevation still retain much of their\r\noriginal configuration, not a vestige of the primeval configuration of\r\nour own Highlands has been preserved; their present surface-features\r\nhave no direct connection with those which must have distinguished them\r\nin late Silurian times. Our existing mountains are not, like those of\r\nthe Alps, mountains of elevation.\r\n\r\nThe structure of a true mountain-chain is frequently very complicated,\r\nbut the general phenomena can be readily expressed in a simple diagram.\r\nLet Fig. 5 be a section taken across a mountain-chain, _i.e._ at right\r\nangles to its trend or direction. The dominant point of the chain is\r\nshown at _B_, while _A_ and _C_ represent the low grounds. Now, an\r\nobserver at _A_, advancing towards _B_, would note that the strata, at\r\nfirst horizontal, would gradually become undulating as he proceeded on\r\nhis way--the undulations getting always more and more pronounced. He\r\nwould observe, moreover, that the undulations, at first symmetrical,\r\nas at _a_, would become less so as he advanced--one limb of an arch\r\nor _anticline_, as it is termed, being inclined at a greater angle\r\nthan the other, as at _b_. Approaching still nearer to =B=, the arches\r\nor anticlines would be seen eventually to bend over upon each other,\r\nso as to produce a general dip or inclination of the strata towards\r\nthe central axis of the chain. Crossing that axis (_B_), and walking\r\nin the direction of the low grounds (_C_), the observer would again\r\nencounter the same structural arrangement, but of course in reverse\r\norder. Thus, in its simplest expression, a true mountain-chain consists\r\nof strata arranged in a series of parallel undulations--the greater\r\nmountain ridges and intervening hollows corresponding more or less\r\nclosely to the larger undulations and folds of the strata. Now, could\r\nthese plicated strata be pulled out, could the folds and reduplications\r\nbe smoothed away, so as to cause the strata to assume their original\r\nhorizontal position, it is obvious that the rocks would occupy a\r\ngreater superficial area. We see, then, that such a mountain-chain\r\nmust owe its origin to a process of tangential or lateral thrusting\r\nand crushing. The originally horizontal strata have been squeezed\r\nlaterally, and have yielded to the force acting upon them by folding\r\nand doubling up. It seems most probable that the larger contortions\r\nand foldings which are visible in all true mountain-chains, owe their\r\norigin to the sinking down of the earth's crust upon the cooling and\r\ncontracting nucleus. During such depressions of the crust the strata\r\nare necessarily subjected to enormous lateral compression; they are\r\nforced to occupy less space at the surface, and this they can only do\r\nby folding and doubling-back upon themselves. If the strata are equally\r\nunyielding throughout a wide area, then general undulation may ensue;\r\nbut should they yield unequally, then folding and contortion will take\r\nplace along one or more lines of weakness. In other words, the pressure\r\nwill be relieved by the formation of true mountain-chains. Thus,\r\nparadoxical as it may seem, the loftiest mountains of the globe bear\r\nwitness to profound depression or subsidence of the crust. The Andes,\r\nfor example, appear to owe their origin to the sinking down of the\r\nearth's crust under the Pacific; and so in like manner the Alps would\r\nseem to have been ridged up by depression of the crust in the area of\r\nthe Mediterranean. Mountain-chains, therefore, are true wrinkles in the\r\ncrust of the earth; they are lines of weakness along which the strata\r\nhave yielded to enormous lateral pressure.\r\n\r\nA glance at the geological structure of the Alps and the Jura shows us\r\nthat these mountains are a typical example of such a chain; they are\r\nmountains of elevation. In the Jura the mountains form a series of long\r\nparallel ridges separated by intervening hollows; and the form or shape\r\nof the ground coincides in a striking manner with the foldings of the\r\nstrata. In these mountains we see a succession of symmetrical flexures,\r\nthe beds dipping in opposite directions at the same angle from the axis\r\nof each individual anticline. There each mountain-ridge corresponds\r\nto an _anticline_, and each valley to a _syncline_, or trough-shaped\r\narrangement of strata. But as we approach the Alps the flexures become\r\nless and less symmetrical, until in the Alps themselves the most\r\nextraordinary convolutions and intricate plications appear, the strata\r\nbeing often reversed or turned completely upside down.\r\n\r\nThough it is true that the slopes of this great mountain-chain\r\nnot infrequently correspond more or less closely to the slope or\r\ninclination of the underlying rocks, it must not be supposed that this\r\ncorrespondence is often complete. Sometimes, indeed, we find that the\r\nmountains, so far from coinciding with anticlines, are in reality\r\nbuilt up of synclinal or basin-shaped strata; while in other cases\r\ndeep and broad valleys run along the lines of anticlinal axes (Fig.\r\n6). All this speaks to enormous erosion. A study of the geological\r\nstructure of the Alps demonstrates that thousands of feet of rock have\r\nbeen removed from those mountains since the time of their elevation. A\r\nsection drawn across any part of the chain would show that the strata\r\nhave been eroded to such an extent, and the whole configuration so\r\nprofoundly modified, that it is often difficult, or even impossible,\r\nto tell what may have been the original form of the surface when the\r\nchain was upheaved. And yet the Alps, it must be remembered, are of\r\ncomparatively recent age, some of their highly-confused and contorted\r\nrocks consisting of marine strata which are of no greater antiquity\r\nthan the incoherent clays and sands of the London Tertiary basin.\r\nNow, when we reflect upon the fact that, in the case of so young a\r\nmountain-chain, the configuration due to undulations of the strata\r\nhas been so greatly modified, and even in many places obliterated, it\r\nis not hard to believe that after sufficient time has elapsed--after\r\nthe Alps have existed for as long a period, say, as the mountains\r\nof middle Germany--every mountain formed of anticlinal strata shall\r\nhave disappeared, and those synclines which now coincide with valleys\r\nshall have developed into hills. The reader who may have paid little\r\nor no attention to geological structure and its influence upon the\r\nform of the ground, will probably think this a strange and extravagant\r\nstatement; yet I hope to show presently that it is supported by all\r\nthat we know of regions of folded strata which have been for long\r\nperiods of time subjected to denudation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n3. Mountains of Circumdenudation.--In countries composed of undulating\r\nand folded strata which have been for long ages exposed to the\r\naction of eroding agents, the ultimate form assumed by the ground\r\nis directly dependent on the character of the rocks, and the mode\r\nof their arrangement. The various rock-masses which occur in such a\r\nneighbourhood as Edinburgh, for example, differ considerably in their\r\npower of resisting denudation. Hence the less readily eroded rocks\r\nhave come in time to form hills of less or greater prominence. Such\r\nis the case with the Castle Rock, Corstorphine Hill, the Braids, the\r\nPentlands, etc. These hills owe their existence, as such, to the fact\r\nthat they are composed of more enduring kinds of rock than the softer\r\nsandstones and shales by which they are surrounded, and underneath\r\nwhich they were formerly buried to great depths. Some hills, again,\r\nwhich are for the most part built up of rocks having the same character\r\nas the strata that occur in the adjacent low grounds, stand up as\r\nprominences simply because they have been preserved by overlying caps\r\nor coverings of harder rocks--rocks which have offered a stronger\r\nresistance to the action of the denuding agents. The Lomond Hills are\r\ngood examples. Those hills consist chiefly of sandstones which have\r\nbeen preserved from demolition by an overlying sheet of basalt-rock.\r\n\r\nBut the mode in which rocks are arranged is a not less important factor\r\nin determining the shape which the ground assumes under the action of\r\nthe agents of erosion. Thus, as we have already seen, flat-topped,\r\npyramidal mountains, and more or less steep-sided or trench-like\r\nvalleys, are characteristic features in regions of horizontal strata.\r\nWhen strata dip or incline in one general direction, then we have a\r\nsuccession of escarpments or dip-slopes, corresponding to the outcrops\r\nof harder or less readily eroded beds, and separated from each other\r\nby long valleys, hollows, or undulating plains, which have the same\r\ntrend as the escarpments (Fig. 7). This kind of configuration is\r\nwell exemplified over a large part of England. The general dip or\r\ninclination of the Mesozoic or Secondary strata throughout that\r\ncountry, between the shores of the North Sea and the English Channel,\r\nis easterly and south-easterly--so that the outcrops of the more\r\ndurable strata form well-defined escarpments that face the west and\r\nnorth-west, and can be followed almost continuously from north to\r\nsouth. Passing from the Malvern Hills in a south-easterly direction,\r\nwe traverse two great escarpments--the first coinciding with the\r\noutcrop of the Oolite, and forming the Cotswold Hills; and the second\r\ncorresponding to the outcrop of the Chalk, and forming the Chiltern\r\nHills. The plains and low undulating tracts that separate these\r\nescarpments mark the outcrops of more yielding strata--the low grounds\r\nthat intervene between the Cotswolds and the Malvern Hills being\r\ncomposed of Liassic and Triassic clays and sandstones. In Scotland\r\nsimilar escarpments occur, but owing to sudden changes of the dip,\r\nand various interruptions of the strata, the Scottish escarpments are\r\nnot so continuous as those of the sister-country. Many of the belts\r\nof hilly ground in the Scottish Lowlands, however, exemplify the\r\nphenomena of escarpment and dip-slope. Thus, the Sidlaws in Forfarshire\r\nconsist of a series of hard igneous rocks and interbedded sandstones\r\nand flags--the outcrops of which form a succession of escarpments with\r\nintervening hollows. The same appearances recur again and again all\r\nover the Lowlands. Wherever, indeed, any considerable bed of hard rock\r\noccurs in a series of less enduring strata--the outcrop of the harder\r\nrock invariably forms a well-marked feature or escarpment. As examples,\r\nI may refer to Salisbury Crags, Craiglockhart Hill, Dalmahoy Crags, the\r\nBathgate Hills, King Alexander's Crag, etc. All these are conspicuous\r\nexamples of the work of denudation--for it can be demonstrated\r\nthat each of these rock-masses was at one time deeply buried under\r\nsandstones and shales, and they now crop out at the surface, and form\r\nprominent features simply because the beds which formerly covered and\r\nsurrounded them have been gradually removed.\r\n\r\nFrom what has now been said it will be readily understood that in\r\nregions composed of strata the inclination or dip of which is not\r\nconstant but continually changing in direction, the surface-features\r\nmust be more or less irregular. If the strata dip east the outcrops\r\nof the harder beds will form escarpments facing the west, and the\r\ndirection of the escarpments will obviously change with the direction\r\nof the dip. Undulating strata of variable composition will, in short,\r\ngive rise to an undulating surface, but the superficial undulations\r\nwill not coincide with those of the strata. On the contrary, in\r\nregions consisting of undulating strata of diverse consistency the\r\nhills generally correspond with synclinal troughs--or, in other words,\r\ntrough-shaped strata tend to form hills; while, on the other hand,\r\narch-shaped or anticlinal strata most usually give rise to hollows\r\n(see Fig. 2). This remarkable fact is one of the first to arrest the\r\nattention of every student of physical geology, and its explanation\r\nis simple enough. An anticlinal arrangement of strata is a weak\r\nstructure--it readily succumbs to the attacks of the denuding agents; a\r\nsynclinal arrangement on the contrary, is a strong structure, which is\r\nmuch less readily broken up. Hence it is that in all regions which have\r\nbeen exposed for prolonged periods to sub-aërial denudation synclinal\r\nstrata naturally come to form hills, and anticlinal strata valleys or\r\nlow grounds. In the case of a mountain-chain so recently elevated as\r\nthat of the Alps, the mountain-ridges, as we have seen, often coincide\r\nroughly with the greater folds of the strata. Such anticlinal mountains\r\nare weakly built, and consequently rock-falls and landslips are of\r\ncommon occurrence among them--far more common, and on a much larger\r\nscale, than among the immeasurably older mountains of Scandinavia and\r\nScotland. The valleys of the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the Apennines,\r\nare cumbered with enormous chaotic heaps of fallen rock-masses. From\r\ntime to time peaks and whole mountain-sides give way, and slide into\r\nthe valleys, burying hamlets and villages, and covering wide tracts of\r\ncultivated land. Hundreds of such disastrous rock-falls have occurred\r\nin the Alps within historical ages, and must continue to take place\r\nuntil every weakly-formed mountain has been demolished. The hills\r\nand mountains of Scotland have long since passed through this phase\r\nof unstable equilibrium. After countless ages of erosion our higher\r\ngrounds have acquired a configuration essentially different from that\r\nof a true mountain-chain. Enormous landslips like that of the Rossberg\r\nare here impossible, for all such weakly-constructed mountains have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will serve to show how such modifications and\r\nchanges have come about. When strata are crumpled up they naturally\r\ncrack across, for they are not elastic. During the great movements\r\nwhich have originated all mountains of elevation, it is evident\r\nthat the strata forming the actual surface of the ground would often\r\nbe greatly fissured and shattered along the crests of the sharper\r\nanticlinal ridges. In the synclinal troughs, however, although much\r\nfissuring would take place, yet the strata would be compelled by the\r\npressure to keep together. Now, when we study the structure of such a\r\nregion as the Alps, we find that the tops of the anticlines have almost\r\ninvariably been removed, so as to expose the truncated ends of the\r\nstrata--the ruptured and shattered rock-masses having in the course\r\nof time been carried away by the agents of erosion. Such mountains\r\nare pre-eminently weak structures. Let us suppose that the mountains\r\nrepresented in the diagram (Fig. 8) consist of a succession of strata,\r\nsome of which are more or less permeable by water, while others are\r\npractically impermeable. It is obvious that water soaking down from the\r\nsurface will find its way through the porous strata (_p_), and come out\r\non the slopes of the mountains along the joints and cracks (_c_) by\r\nwhich all strata are traversed. Under the influence of such springs and\r\nthe action of frost, the rock at the surface will eventually be broken\r\nup, and ever and anon larger and smaller portions will slide downwards\r\nover the surface of the underlying impermeable stratum. The undermining\r\naction of rivers will greatly intensify this disintegrating and\r\ndisrupting process. As the river deepens and widens its valley (_v_),\r\nit is apparent that in doing so it must truncate the strata that are\r\ninclined towards it. The beds will then crop out upon the slopes of the\r\nvalley (as at _b_, _b_), and so the conditions most favourable for a\r\nlandslip will arise. Underground water, percolating through the porous\r\nbeds (p), and over the surface of the underlying impermeable beds (_i_,\r\n_i_, _i_), must eventually bring about a collapse. The rocks forming\r\nthe surface-slopes of the mountain will from time to time give and\r\nslide into the valley, or the whole thickness of the truncated strata\r\nmay break away and rush downwards; and this process must continue so\r\nlong as any portion of the anticlinal arch remains above the level of\r\nthe adjacent synclinal troughs.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that an anticlinal arch is a weak structure--a\r\nmountain so constructed falls a ready prey to the denuding agents; and\r\nhence in regions which have been exposed to denudation for as long a\r\nperiod as the Scottish or Scandinavian uplands, a mountain formed of\r\nanticlinally arranged strata is of very exceptional occurrence. When\r\nit does appear, it is only because the rocks of which it is composed\r\nhappen to be of a more enduring character than those of the adjacent\r\ntracts. The Ochil Hills exemplify this point. These hills consist of a\r\ngreat series of hard igneous rocks, which are arranged in the form of a\r\ndepressed anticlinal arch--the low grounds lying to the north and south\r\nbeing composed chiefly of sandstones and shales. Here it is owing to\r\nthe more enduring character of the igneous rocks that the anticlinal\r\narch has not been entirely removed. We know, however, that these\r\nigneous rocks were formerly buried under a great thickness of strata,\r\nand that their present appearance at the surface is simply the result\r\nof denudation.\r\n\r\nIf an anticlinal arch be a weak structure, a synclinal arrangement of\r\nstrata is quite the opposite. In the case of the former each bed has\r\na tendency to slip or slide away from the axis, while in a syncline\r\nit is just the reverse--the strata being inclined towards and not\r\naway from the axis. Underground water, springs, and frost are enabled\r\nto play havoc with anticlinal strata, for the structure is entirely\r\nin their favour. But in synclinal beds the action of these powerful\r\nagents is opposed by the structure of the rocks--and great rock-falls\r\nand landslips cannot take place. Synclinal strata therefore endure,\r\nwhile anticlinal strata are worn more readily away. Even in a true\r\nmountain-range so young as the Alps, denudation has already demolished\r\nmany weakly-built anticlinal mountains, and opened up valleys along\r\ntheir axes; while, on the other hand, synclinal troughs have been\r\nconverted into mountains. And if this be true of the Alps, it is still\r\nmore so of much older mountain-regions, in which the original contours\r\ndue to convolutions of the strata have entirely disappeared (see Fig.\r\n9).\r\n\r\nThe mountains of such regions, having been carved out and modelled by\r\ndenuding agents, are rightly termed _mountains of circumdenudation_,\r\nfor they are just as much the work of erosion as the flat-topped and\r\npyramidal mountains which have been carved out of horizontal strata.\r\nThe Scottish Highlands afford us an admirable example of a mountainous\r\nregion of undulating and often highly-flexed strata, in which the\r\npresent surface-features are the result of long-continued erosion. As\r\nalready remarked, this region is one of the oldest land-surfaces in the\r\nworld. In comparison with it, the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the Himalayas\r\nare creations of yesterday. The original surface or configuration\r\nassumed by the rocks composing our Highland area at the time when these\r\nwere first crushed and folded into anticlines and synclines had already\r\nbeen demolished at a period inconceivably more remote than the latest\r\ngrand upheaval of the Alps. Even before the commencement of Old Red\r\nSandstone times, our Archæan, Cambrian, and Silurian rocks had been\r\nplaned down for thousands of feet, so that the bottom beds of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone were deposited upon a gently undulating surface, which\r\ncuts across anticlines and synclines alike. In late Silurian and early\r\npost-Silurian times the North-west Highlands probably existed as a true\r\nmountain-chain, consisting of a series of parallel ranges formed by the\r\nfolding and reduplication of the strata. The recent observations of my\r\nfriends, Professor Lapworth and Messrs. Peach and Horne, in Sutherland,\r\nhave brought to light the evidence of gigantic earth-movements, by\r\nwhich enormous masses of strata have been convoluted and pushed\r\nfor miles out of place. We see in that region part of a dissected\r\nmountain-chain. The mountain-masses which are there exposed to view\r\nare the basal or lower portions of enormous sheets of disrupted rock,\r\nthe upper parts of which have been removed by denudation. In a word,\r\nthe mountains of Sutherland are mountains of circumdenudation--they\r\nhave been carved out of elevated masses by the long-continued action\r\nof erosion. To prove this, one has only to draw an accurate section\r\nacross the North-west Highlands, when it becomes apparent that the\r\nform or shape of the ground does not correspond or coincide with the\r\nconvolutions of the strata, and that a thickness of thousands of\r\nfeet of rock has been denuded away since those strata were folded and\r\nfractured. All over the Highlands we meet with similar evidence of\r\nenormous denudation. The great masses of granite which appear at the\r\nsurface in many places are eloquent of the result produced by erosion\r\ncontinued for immeasurable periods of time. Every geologist knows that\r\ngranite is a rock which could only have been formed and consolidated at\r\ngreat depths. When, therefore, such a rock occurs at the surface, it is\r\nevidence beyond all doubt of prodigious erosion. The granite has been\r\nlaid bare by the removal of the thick rock-masses underneath which it\r\ncooled and consolidated.\r\n\r\nA glance at any map of Scotland will show that many river-valleys, and\r\nnot a few lakes, of the Highlands have a north-east and south-west\r\ntrend. This trend corresponds to what geologists call the _strike_ of\r\nthe strata. The rocks of the Highlands have been compressed into a\r\nseries of folds or anticlines and synclines, which have the direction\r\njust stated--namely, north-east and south-west. A careless observer\r\nmight therefore rashly conclude that these surface-features resembled\r\nthose of the Jura--in other words, that the long parallel hollows were\r\nsynclinal troughs, and that the intervening ridges and high grounds\r\nwere anticlinal arches or saddle-backs. Nothing could be further from\r\nthe truth. A geological examination of the ground would show that\r\nthe features in question were everywhere the result of denudation,\r\nguided by the petrological character and geological structure of the\r\nrocks. Several of the most marked hollows run along the backs of\r\nanticlinal axes, while some of the most conspicuous mountains are\r\nbuilt up of synclinal or trough-shaped strata. Ben Lawers, and the\r\ndepression occupied by Loch Tay, are excellent examples; and since\r\nthat district has recently been mapped in detail by Mr. J. Grant\r\nWilson, of the Geological Survey, I shall give a section (Fig. 10) to\r\nshow the relation between the form of the ground and the geological\r\nstructure of the rocks. This section speaks for itself. Here evidently\r\nis a case where \"valleys have been exalted and mountains made low.\"\r\nA well-marked syncline, it will be observed, passes through Ben\r\nLawers, while Loch Tay occupies a depression scooped out of an equally\r\nwell-defined anticline--a structure which is just the opposite of\r\nthat which we should expect to find in a true mountain-chain. It will\r\nbe also noted that Glen-Lyon coincides neither with a syncline nor a\r\nfault; it has been eroded along the outcrops of the strata. Many of the\r\nnorth-east and south-west hollows of the Highlands indeed run along\r\nthe base of what are really great escarpments--a feature which, as we\r\nhave seen, is constantly met with in every region where the strata\r\n\"strike\" more or less steadily in one direction. In the Highlands the\r\nstrata are most frequently inclined at considerable angles, so that the\r\nescarpments succeed each other more rapidly than would be the case if\r\nthe strata were less steeply inclined. In no case does any north-east\r\nand south-west hollow coincide with a structural cavity. Loch Awe has\r\nbeen cited as an example of a superficial depression formed by the\r\ninward dip of the strata on either side. But, as was shown many years\r\nago by my brother, A. Geikie,[E] this lake winds across the _strike_\r\nof the strata. Moreover, if it owed its existence to a great synclinal\r\nfold, why, he asks, does it not run along the same line as far as the\r\nsame structure continues? It does not do so: it is not continuous with\r\nthe synclinal fold, while vertical strata appear in the middle of the\r\nlake, where, as my brother remarks, they have clearly no business to be\r\nif the sides of the lake are formed by the inward dip of the schists.\r\n\r\n[E] _Trans. Edin. Geol. Soc._ vol. ii. p. 267.\r\n\r\nThe Great Glen, as I mentioned in the preceding article, coincides\r\nwith a fracture or dislocation--a line of weakness along which the\r\ndenuding agents had worked for many ages before the beginning of Old\r\nRed Sandstone times; and it is possible that smaller dislocations\r\nmay yet be detected in other valleys. But in each and every case the\r\nvalleys as we now see them are valleys of erosion; in each and every\r\ncase the mountains are mountains of circumdenudation; they project\r\nas eminences because the rock-masses which formerly surrounded them\r\nhave been gradually removed. We have only to protract the outcrops\r\nof the denuded strata--to restore their continuations--to form some\r\nfaint idea of the enormous masses of rock which have been carried away\r\nfrom the surface of the Highland area since the strata were folded\r\nand fractured. All this erosion speaks to the lapse of long ages. The\r\nmountains of elevation which doubtless at one time existed within\r\nthe Highland area had already, as we have seen, suffered extreme\r\nerosion before the beginning of Old Red Sandstone times, much of\r\nthe area having been converted into an undulating plateau or plain,\r\nwhich, becoming submerged in part, was gradually overspread by the\r\nsedimentary deposits of the succeeding Old Red Sandstone period. Those\r\nsediments were doubtless derived in large measure from the denudation\r\nof the older rocks of the Highlands, and since they attain in places\r\na thickness of 20,000 feet, and cover many square miles, they help\r\nus to realise in some measure the vast erosion the Highland area had\r\nsustained before the commencement of the Carboniferous period. Nor\r\nmust we forget that the Old Red Sandstone formation which borders the\r\nHighlands has itself experienced excessive denudation: it formerly had\r\na much greater extension, and doubtless at one time overspread large\r\ntracts of the Highlands. Again, we have to remember that during the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian periods, and the later Mesozoic and Cainozoic\r\neras, the Highlands probably remained more or less continuously in the\r\ncondition of land. Bearing this in mind, we need not be surprised that\r\nnot a vestige of the primeval configuration brought about by the great\r\nearth-movements of late Silurian times has been preserved. Indeed, had\r\nthe Highland area, after the disappearance of the Old Red Sandstone\r\ninland seas, remained undisturbed by any movement of elevation or\r\ndepression, it must long ago have been reduced by sub-aërial erosion to\r\nthe condition of a low-lying undulating plain. But elevation en masse\r\nfrom time to time took place, and so running water and its numerous\r\nallies have been enabled to carry on the work of denudation.\r\n\r\nThus in the geological history of the Scottish Highlands we may trace\r\nthe successive phases through which many other elevated tracts\r\nhave passed. The Scandinavian plateau, and many of the mountains of\r\nmiddle Germany--such, for example, as the Harz, the Erzgebirge, the\r\nThüringer-Wald, etc.--show by their structure that they have undergone\r\nsimilar changes. First we have an epoch of mountain-elevation, when the\r\nstrata are squeezed and crushed laterally, fractured and shattered--the\r\nresult being the production of a series of more or less parallel\r\nanticlines and synclines, or, in other words, a true mountain-chain.\r\nNext we have a prolonged period of erosion, during which running water\r\nflows through synclinal troughs, works along the backs of broken and\r\nshattered anticlines, and makes its way by joints, gaping cracks,\r\nand dislocations, to the low grounds. As time goes on, the varying\r\ncharacter of the rocks and the mode of their arrangement begin to tell:\r\nthe weaker structures are broken up; rock-falls and landslips ever and\r\nanon take place; anticlinal ridges are gradually demolished, while\r\nsynclines tend to endure, and thus grow, as it were, into hills, by\r\nthe gradual removal of the more weakly-constructed rock-masses that\r\nsurround them. Valleys continue to be deepened and widened, while the\r\nintervening mountains, eaten into by the rivers and their countless\r\nfeeders, and shattered and pulverised by springs and frosts, are\r\ngradually narrowed, interrupted, and reduced, until eventually what\r\nwas formerly a great mountain-chain becomes converted into a low-lying\r\nundulating plain. Should the region now experience a movement of\r\ndepression, and sink under the sea, new sedimentary deposits will\r\ngather over its surface to a depth, it may be, of many hundreds or even\r\nthousands of feet. Should this sunken area be once more elevated en\r\nmasse--pushed up bodily until it attains a height of several thousand\r\nfeet--it will form a plateau, composed of a series of horizontal strata\r\nresting on the contorted and convoluted rocks of the ancient denuded\r\nmountain-chain. The surface of the plateau will now be traversed by\r\nstreams and rivers, and in course of time it must become deeply cleft\r\nand furrowed, the ground between the various valleys rising into\r\nmountain-masses. Should the land remain stationary, its former fate\r\nshall again overtake it; it will inevitably be degraded and worn down\r\nby the sub-aërial agents of erosion, until once more it assumes the\r\ncharacter of a low-lying undulating plain.\r\n\r\nThrough such phases our Highlands have certainly passed. At a very\r\nearly epoch the Archæan rocks of the north-west were ridged up into\r\ngreat mountain-masses, but before the beginning of the pre-Cambrian\r\nperiod wide areas of those highly-contorted rocks had already been\r\nplaned across, so that when subsidence ensued the pre-Cambrian\r\nsandstones were deposited upon a gently undulating surface of highly\r\nconvoluted strata. Another great epoch of mountain-making took place\r\nafter Lower Silurian times, and true mountain-ranges once more appeared\r\nin the Highland area. We cannot tell how high those mountains may have\r\nbeen, but they might well have rivalled the Alps. After their elevation\r\na prolonged period of erosion ensued, and the lofty mountain-land\r\nwas reduced in large measure to the condition of a plain, wide areas\r\nof which were subsequently overflowed by the inland seas of Old Red\r\nSandstone times--so that the sediments of those seas or lakes now\r\nrest with a violent unconformity on the upturned and denuded edges\r\nof the folded and contorted Silurian strata. At a later geological\r\nperiod the whole Highland area was elevated _en masse_, forming an\r\nundulating plateau, traversed by countless streams and rivers, some of\r\nwhich flowed in hollows that had existed before the beginning of Old\r\nRed Sandstone times. Since that epoch of elevation the Highland area,\r\nalthough subject to occasional oscillations of level, would appear to\r\nhave remained more or less continuously in the condition of dry land.\r\nThe result is, that the ancient plateau of erosion has been deeply\r\nincised--the denuding agents have carved it into mountain and glen--the\r\nforms and directions of which have been determined partly by the\r\noriginal surface-slopes of the plateau, and partly by the petrological\r\ncharacter of the rocks and the geological structure of the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                               PLATE II.\r\n\r\n        INFLUENCE OF ROCK STRUCTURE ON THE FORM OF THE GROUND.\r\n\r\n    FIG. 1.

Bartholomew F.R.G.S.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus, in the evolution of the surface-features of the earth, the\r\nworking of two great classes of geological agents is conspicuous--the\r\nsubterranean and the sub-aërial. The sinking down of the crust upon the\r\ncooling nucleus would appear to have given rise to the great oceanic\r\ndepressions and continental ridges, just as the minor depressions\r\nwithin our continental areas have originated many mountain-chains. In\r\nthe area undergoing depression the strata are subjected to intense\r\nlateral pressure, to which they yield along certain lines by folding\r\nup. The strata forming the Alps, which are 130 miles broad, originally\r\noccupied a width of 200 miles; and similar evidence of enormous\r\ncompression is conspicuous in the structure of all mountains of\r\nelevation. Great elevation, however, may take place with little or\r\nno disturbance of stratification: wide continental areas have been\r\nslowly upheaved _en masse_, and sea-bottoms and low-lying plains\r\nhave in this way been converted into lofty plateaux.[F] Many of the\r\nmost conspicuous features of the earth's surface, therefore, are due\r\ndirectly to subterranean action. All those features, however, become\r\nmodified by denudation, and eventually the primeval configuration\r\nmay be entirely destroyed, and replaced by contours which bear no\r\ndirect relation to the form of the original surface. (See Fig. 9.)\r\nIn the newer mountain-chains of the globe the surface-features are\r\nstill largely those due directly to upheaval; so in some recently\r\nelevated plateaux the ground has not yet been cut up and converted into\r\nirregular mountain-masses. Many of the more ancient mountain-chains\r\nand ranges, however, have been exposed so long to the abrading action\r\nof the denuding agents that all trace of their original contour has\r\nvanished. And in like manner plateaux of great age have been so\r\nhighly denuded, so cut and carved by the tools of erosion, that their\r\nplateau character has become obscured. They have been converted into\r\nundulating mountainous and hilly regions. Everywhere throughout the\r\nworld we read the same tale of subsidence and accumulation, of upheaval\r\nand denudation. The ancient sedimentary deposits which form the major\r\nportion of our land-surfaces, are the waste materials derived from\r\nthe demolition of plains, plateaux, and mountains of elevation. In\r\nsome mountain-regions we read the evidence of successive epochs of\r\nuplift, separated by long intervening periods of erosion, followed\r\nby depression and accumulation of newer sediments over the denuded\r\nsurface. Thus the Alps began to be elevated towards the close of\r\nPalæozoic times. Erosion followed, and subsequently the land became\r\ndepressed, and a vast succession of deposits accumulated over its\r\nsurface during the long-continued Mesozoic era into early Cainozoic\r\ntimes. Again, a great upheaval ensued, and the Mesozoic and Eocene\r\nstrata were violently contorted and folded along the flanks of the\r\nchain. Then succeeded another period of erosion and depression, which\r\nwas again interrupted by one or more extensive upheavals. Away from\r\nthose lines of weakness which we call mountain-chains, we constantly\r\nencounter evidence of widespread movements of elevation, during\r\nwhich broad areas of sea-bottom have been upheaved to the light of\r\nday, and, after suffering extensive denudation have subsided, to be\r\nagain overspread with the spoils of adjacent lands, and then upheaved\r\nonce more. And such oscillations of level have occurred again and\r\nagain. Looking back through the long vista of the past, we see each\r\ncontinental area in a state of flux--land alternating with sea, and\r\nsea with land--mountains and plateaux appearing and disappearing--a\r\nconstant succession of modifications, brought about by the antagonistic\r\nsubterranean and sub-aërial agents.\r\n\r\n    The hills are shadows, and they flow\r\n        From form to form, and nothing stands;\r\n        They melt like mists, the solid lands,\r\n    Like clouds they shape themselves and go.\r\n\r\n[F] This is the generally accepted view of modern geologists. It is\r\nvery difficult, however, to understand how a wide continental area can\r\nbe vertically upheaved. It seems more probable that the upheaval of the\r\nland is only apparent. The land seems to rise because the sea retreats\r\nas the result of the subsidence of the crust within the great oceanic\r\nbasins. See Article xiv. (1892.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe Cheviot Hills.[G]\r\n\r\n[G] From _Good Words_ for 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe ridge of high ground that separates England from Scotland is not,\r\nlike many other hilly districts, the beloved of tourists. No guide-book\r\nexpatiates upon the attractiveness of the Cheviots; no cunningly-worded\r\nhotel-puffs lure the unwary vagrant in search of health, or sport,\r\nor the picturesque, to the quiet dells and pastoral uplands of the\r\nBorders. Since the biographer of Dandie Dinmont, of joyous memory,\r\njoined the shades, no magic sentences, either in verse or prose,\r\nhave turned any appreciable portion of the annual stream of tourists\r\nin the direction of the Cheviots. The scenery is not of a nature to\r\nsatisfy the desires of those who look for something piquant--something\r\n\"sensational,\" as it were. It is therefore highly improbable that\r\nthe primeval repose of these Border uplands will ever be disturbed\r\nby inroads of the \"travelling public,\" even should some second Burns\r\narise to render the names of hills and streams as familiar as household\r\nwords. And yet those who can spare the time to make themselves well\r\nacquainted with that region should do so; they will have no reason\r\nto regret their visit, but very much the reverse. For the scenery is\r\nof a kind which grows upon one. It shows no clamant beauties--you\r\ncannot have its charms photographed--the passing stranger may see\r\nnothing in it to detain him; but only tarry for a while amongst these\r\ngreen uplands, and you shall find a strange attraction in their soft\r\noutlines, in their utter quiet and restfulness. For those who are\r\nwearied with the crush and din of life, I cannot think of a better\r\nretreat. One may wander at will amongst the breezy hills, and inhale\r\nthe most invigorating air; springs of the coolest and clearest water\r\nabound, and there are few of the brooks in their upper reaches which\r\nwill not furnish natural shower-baths. Did the reader ever indulge in\r\nsuch a mountain-bath? If not, then let him on a summer day seek out\r\nsome rocky pool, sheltered from the sun, if possible, by birch and\r\nmountain-ash, and, creeping in below the stream where it leaps from the\r\nledges above, allow the cool water to break upon his head, and he will\r\nconfess to having discovered a new aqueous luxury. Then from the slopes\r\nand tops of the hills you have some of the finest panoramic views to\r\nbe seen in this island. Nor are there wanting picturesque nooks, and\r\nstriking rock scenery amongst the hills themselves: the sides of the\r\nCheviot are seamed with some wild, rugged chasms, which are just as\r\nweird in their way as many of the rocky ravines that eat into the\r\nheart of our Highland mountains. The beauty of the lower reaches of\r\nsome of the streams that issue from the Cheviots is well known; and\r\nfew tourists who enter the vale of the Teviot neglect to make the\r\nacquaintance of the sylvan Jed. But other streams, such as the Bowmont,\r\nthe Kale, the Oxnam, and the Rule will also well repay a visit. In\r\naddition to all these natural charms, the Cheviot district abounds in\r\nother attractions. Those who are fond of Border lore, who love to seek\r\nout the sites of old forays, and battles, and romantic incidents, will\r\nfind much to engage them; for every stream, and almost every hill, is\r\nnoted in tale and ballad. Or if the visitor have antiquarian tastes, he\r\nmay rival old Monkbarns, and do his best to explain the history of the\r\nendless camps, ramparts, ditches, and terraces which abound everywhere,\r\nespecially towards the heads of the valleys. To the geologist the\r\ndistrict is not less interesting, as I hope to be able, in the course\r\nof these papers, to show. The geological history of the Cheviots might\r\nbe shortly summed up, and given in a narrative form, but it will\r\nperhaps be more interesting, and, at the same time more instructive,\r\nif we shall, instead, go a little into detail, and show first what\r\nthe nature of the evidence is, and, second, how that evidence may be\r\npieced together so as to tell its own story. I may just premise that\r\nmy descriptions refer almost exclusively to the Scottish side of the\r\nCheviots--which is not only the most picturesque, but also the most\r\ninteresting, both from an antiquarian and geological point of view.\r\n\r\nThe Cheviots extend from the head of the Tyne in Northumberland, and\r\nof the Liddel in Roxburghshire, to Yeavering Bell and the heights\r\nin its neighbourhood (near Wooler), a distance of upwards of thirty\r\nmiles. Some will have it that the range goes westward so as to include\r\nthe heights about the source of the Teviot, but this is certainly a\r\nmistake, for after leaving Peel Fell and crossing to the heights on the\r\nother side of the Liddel Water, we enter a region which, both in its\r\nphysical aspect and its geological structure, differs considerably from\r\nthe hilly district that lies between Peel Fell and the high-grounds\r\nthat roll down to the wide plains watered by the Glen and the Till.\r\nThe highest point in the range is that which gives its name to the\r\nhills--namely, the Cheviot--a massive broad-topped hill, which reaches\r\nan elevation of 2767 feet above the sea, and from which a wonderful\r\npanorama can be scanned on a clear day. The top of the hill is coated\r\nwith peat, fifteen to twenty feet thick, in some places. A number of\r\ndeep ravines trench its slopes, the most noted of which are Hen Hole\r\nand the Bizzle. Peel Fell, at the other extremity of the range, is\r\nonly 1964 feet high, while the dominant points between Peel Fell and\r\nthe Cheviot are still lower--ranging from 1500 feet to 1800 feet. The\r\ngeneral character of the hills is that of smooth rounded masses, with\r\nlong flowing outlines. There are no peaks, nor serrated ridges, such as\r\nare occasionally met with in the northern Highlands; and the valleys\r\nas a rule show no precipitous crags and rocky precipices, the most\r\nconspicuous exceptions being the deep clefts mentioned as occurring in\r\nthe Cheviot. The hills fall away with a long gentle slope into England,\r\nwhile on the Scottish side the descent is somewhat abrupt; so that\r\nupon the whole the northern or Scottish portion of the Cheviots has\r\nmore of the picturesque to commend it than the corresponding districts\r\nin England. Indeed, the opposite slopes of the range show some rather\r\nstriking contrasts. The long, flat-topped elevations on the English\r\nside, that sweep south and south-west from Carter Fell and Harden Edge,\r\nand which are drained by the Tyne, the Rede Water, and the Coquet,\r\nare covered for the most part with peat. Sometimes, however, when the\r\nslope is too great to admit of its growth, the peat gives place to\r\nrough scanty grass and scrubby heath, which barely suffice to hide the\r\nunderlying barren sandstone rocks. One coming from the Scottish side\r\nis hardly prepared, indeed, for the dreary aspect of this region as\r\nviewed from the dominant ridge of the Cheviots. If in their physical\r\naspect the English slopes of these hills are for the most part less\r\nattractive than the Scottish, it is true also that they offer less\r\nvariety of interest to the geologist. Those who have journeyed in\r\nstagecoaching times from England into Scotland by Carter Fell, will\r\nremember the relief they felt when, having surmounted the hill above\r\nWhitelee, and escaped from the dreary barrens of the English border,\r\nthey suddenly caught a sight of the green slopes of the Scottish hills,\r\nand the well-wooded vales of Edgerston Burn and Jed Water. On a clear\r\nday the view from this point is very charming. Away to the west stretch\r\nin seemingly endless undulations the swelling hills that circle round\r\nthe upper reaches of Teviotdale. To east and north-east the eye glances\r\nalong the bright-green Cheviots of the Scottish border, and marks how\r\nthey plunge, for the most part somewhat suddenly, into the low grounds,\r\nsave here and there, where they sink in gentler slopes, or throw out a\r\nfew scattered outposts--abrupt verdant hills that somehow look as if\r\nthey had broken away from the main mass of the range. From the same\r\nstandpoint one traces the valleys of the Rule and the Jed--sweetest\r\nof border streams--stretching north into the well-clothed vale of the\r\nTeviot. Indeed, nearly the whole of that highly-cultivated and often\r\nrichly-wooded country that extends from the base of the Cheviots to\r\nthe foot of the Lammermuirs, lies stretched before one. Here and there\r\nabrupt isolated hills rise up amid the undulating low grounds, to hide\r\nthe country behind them. Of these the most picturesque are dark Rubers\r\nLaw, overlooking the Rule Water; Minto Crags, and Penielheugh with its\r\nugly excrescence of a monument, both on the north side of the Teviot;\r\nand the Eildon Hills, which, as all the world knows, are near Melrose.\r\n\r\nAfter he has sated himself with the rare beauty of this landscape (and\r\nstill finer panoramic views are to be had from the top of Blackhall\r\nHill, Hownam Law, the Cheviot, as also from various points on the line\r\nof the Roman Road and other paths across the hills into England),\r\nthe observer will hardly fail to be struck by the great variety of\r\noutlines exhibited. Some of the hills, especially those to the west and\r\nnorth-west, are grouped in heavy masses, and present for the most part\r\na soft, rounded contour, the hills being broad atop and flowing into\r\neach other with long, smooth slopes. Other elevations, such as those\r\nto the east and north-east of Carter Fell, while showing similar long\r\ngentle slopes, yet are somewhat more irregular in form and broken in\r\noutline, the hills having frequently a lumpy contour. Very noteworthy\r\nobjects in the landscape also are the little isolated hills of the\r\nlow grounds, such as Rubers Law, and the Dunian, above Jedburgh. They\r\nrise, as I have said, quite suddenly out of that low gently undulating\r\ncountry that sinks softly into the vales of the Teviot and the Tweed.\r\nThis variety arises from the geological structure of the district. The\r\nhills vary in outline partly because they are made up of different\r\nkinds of rock, and partly owing to the mode in which these rocks have\r\nbeen arranged. But notwithstanding all this variety of outline, one\r\nmay notice a certain sameness too. Flowing outlines are more or less\r\nconspicuous all over the landscape. Many of the hills, especially as\r\nwe descend into Teviotdale, seem to have been smoothed or rounded off,\r\nas it were, so as to present their steepest faces as a rule towards\r\nthe south-west. And if we take the compass-bearing of the hill-ridges\r\nof the same district, we shall find that these generally trend from\r\nsouth-west to north-east So much, then, at present for the surface\r\nconfiguration of the Cheviot region. When we come to treat of the\r\nvarious rock-masses, and to describe the superficial accumulations\r\nunderneath which these are often concealed, we shall be in a better\r\nposition to give an intelligible account of the peculiar form of the\r\nground, and the causes to which that configuration must be ascribed.\r\n\r\nThe solid rocks which enter into the composition of the Cheviots\r\nconsist mainly of (1) hard grey and blue rocks, called _greywacké_ by\r\ngeologists, with which are associated blue and grey shale; (2) various\r\nold igneous rocks; and (3) sandstones, red and white, interbedded\r\nwith which occur occasional dark shales. Now, before we can make any\r\nendeavour towards reconstructing in outline the physical geography of\r\nthe Cheviot Hills during past ages, it is necessary that we should\r\ndiscover the order in which the rock-masses just referred to have been\r\namassed. I shall first describe, therefore, some sections where the\r\nmembers of the different series are found in juxtaposition, for the\r\npurpose of pointing out which is the lowest-lying, and consequently the\r\noldest, and which occupy the uppermost and intermediate positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 1.--Conglomerate and Red Sandstone, etc., _c_,\r\nresting on Greywacké and Shale, _g_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first section to which reference may be made is exposed in the\r\ncourse of the River Jed, at Allars Mill, a little above Jedburgh.\r\nThis section is famous in its way as having been described and\r\nfigured by Dr. Hutton, who may be said to have founded the present\r\nsystem of physical geology. In the bed of the stream are seen certain\r\nconfused ridges of a greyish blue rock running right across the river\r\ncourse--that is, in a direction a little north of east and south\r\nof west. These ridges are the exposed edges of beds of greywacké\r\nand shale, which are here standing on end. The beds are somewhat\r\nirregular, being inclined from the vertical, now in one direction\r\nand now in another, or, as a geologist would say, the \"dip\" changes\r\nrapidly, sometimes being up the valley and sometimes down. The same\r\nbeds continue up the steep bank of the river for a yard or two, and\r\nare there capped by another set of rocks altogether, namely, by soft\r\nred sandy beds which at the bottom become _conglomeratic_--that is\r\nto say, they are charged with water-worn stones. The annexed diagram\r\n(Fig. 1) will show the general appearances presented: _g_ represents\r\nthe vertical greywacké and shale, and _c_ the overlying deposits of\r\nconglomerate and red sandy beds. Now let us see what this section\r\nmeans. What, in the first place, is greywacké? The term itself has\r\nreally no meaning, being a name given by the miners in the Harz\r\nMountains to the unproductive rocks associated with the vein-stones\r\nwhich they work. When we break the rock we may observe that it is a\r\ngranular mixture of small particles of quartz, to which sometimes\r\nfelspar and other minerals are added. The grains are bound together\r\nin a hardened matrix of argillaceous or clayey and silicious matter,\r\nblue, or grey, or green, or brown and yellow, as the case may be.\r\nAt Allars Mill, and generally throughout the Cheviot district, the\r\nprevailing colour is a pale greyish blue or bluish grey; but shades of\r\ngreen and brown often occur. The component particles of the rock are\r\nusually rounded or water-worn. Again, we notice that the ridges and\r\nbands of rock that traverse the course of the Jed at Allars Mill are\r\nmerely the outcrops of successive _strata_ or beds. It is clear then\r\nthat greywacké and the grey shales that accompany it are _aqueous_\r\nrocks--that is to say, they consist of hardened sediment, which has\r\nundoubtedly been deposited in successive layers of variable thickness\r\nby water in motion. But since the sediments of rivers and currents\r\nare laid down in approximately horizontal planes, it is evident that\r\nif the greywacké and shale be sedimentary deposits they have suffered\r\nconsiderable disturbance since the time of their formation; for, as\r\nwe have seen, the beds, instead of being horizontal or only gently\r\ninclined, actually approach the vertical. The fact is, that the\r\noutcrops which we see are only the truncated portions of what were\r\nformerly rapid undulations or folds of the strata, the tops of the\r\nfolds or arches having been cut away by geological agencies, to which\r\nI shall refer by-and-by. What were at one time horizontal strata have\r\nbeen crumpled up into great folds, the folds being squeezed tightly\r\ntogether, and their upper portions planed away before the overlying red\r\nsandy beds were laid down. The accompanying diagram (Fig. 2) may serve\r\nto make all this clearer. Let A A represent the present surface of the\r\nground, and B B a depth of say fifty feet or a hundred feet from the\r\nsurface. The continuous lines between A and B represent the greywacké\r\nbeds as we now see them in section; the dotted lines above A A indicate\r\nthe former extension of the strata, and the dotted lines below B B\r\ntheir continuation below that datum line. Hence it is obvious that in\r\na succession of vertical or highly inclined beds, we may have the same\r\nstrata repeated many times, the same beds coming again and again to the\r\nsurface. Thus the stratum at S is evidently the same bed as that at W,\r\nX, Y, and Z.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 2.]\r\n\r\nSuch great foldings or redoublings of strata are most probably\r\noriginated during subsidence of a portion of the earth's crust. While\r\nthe ground is slowly sinking down, the strata underneath are perforce\r\ncompelled to occupy less space laterally, and this they can only do by\r\nyielding amongst themselves. All folding or contortion on the large\r\nscale--that, namely, which has affected areas of strata extending\r\nover whole countries--seems to have taken place under great pressure;\r\nin other words, to have been produced at considerable depths from\r\nthe earth's surface. We can conceive, therefore, of a wide tract of\r\nland sinking down for hundreds of feet, and producing at the surface\r\ncomparatively little change. But a depression of a few hundred feet\r\nat the surface implies a considerably greater depression at a depth\r\nof several thousand feet from the surface, and it is at great depths,\r\ntherefore, that the most violent folding must take place. Consequently\r\nconsiderable contortion, and much folding, and lateral crushing\r\nand reduplication of strata may occur, and yet no trace of this be\r\nobservable at the surface, save only a gentle depression. For example,\r\nin Greenland, a movement of subsidence has been going on for many\r\nyears--the land has been slowly sinking down. The rocks at the surface\r\nare of course quite undisturbed by this widely-extended movement, but\r\nthe strata at great depths may be undergoing much compression and\r\ncontortion. It follows from such considerations, that if we now get\r\nhighly contorted strata covering wide areas at the surface, we suspect\r\nthat very considerable _denudation_ has taken place. That is to say,\r\nlarge masses of rock have been removed by the geological agents of\r\nchange, so as to expose the once deeply-buried tops of the arched or\r\ncurved and folded strata. We may therefore infer from a study of the\r\nphenomena in the Jed at Allars Mill, first, that the red sandy beds are\r\nyounger than the greywacké and shale, seeing that they rest upon them;\r\nand, second, that a very long period of time must have elapsed between\r\nthe deposition of the older and the accumulation of the younger set\r\nof strata; for it is obvious that considerable time was required for\r\nthe consolidation and folding of the greywacké, and an incalculable\r\nlapse of ages was also necessary to allow of the gradual wearing away\r\nby rain, frost, and running water of the great thickness of rocks\r\nunderneath which the greywacké was crumpled. And all this took place\r\nbefore the horizontally-bedded red sandstone and conglomerate gathered\r\nover the upturned ends of the underlying strata. The succession of\r\nrocks at Allars Mill is seen in many other places in the Cheviot\r\ndistrict, but enough has been said to prove that the greywacké beds are\r\nthe older of the two sets of strata.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of rocks, the relative position of which we\r\nmust now ascertain, for no one shall wander much or far among the\r\nCheviots without becoming aware of the existence of other kinds of\r\nrock than greywacké and sandstone. Many of the hills east of Oxnam\r\nand Jed Waters, for example, are composed of igneous masses--of\r\nrocks which have had a volcanic origin. As we shall afterwards see,\r\nthe whole north-eastern section of the Cheviots is built up of such\r\nrocks. At present, however, we are only concerned with the relation\r\nwhich these bear to the greywacké and the red sandy beds. Now at\r\nvarious localities--for example, in Edgerston Burn, on the hill-face\r\nsouth of Plenderleith, and again along the steep front of Hindhope\r\nand Blackball Hills, which are on the crest of the Cheviots--we find\r\nthat the igneous rocks rest upon the greywacké and shale (see Fig. 3)\r\nprecisely in the same way as do the red sandy beds. They therefore\r\nbelong to a later date than the greywacké. In other places, again, we\r\nmeet with the conglomerates and red sandstones (_c_, Fig. 4) resting\r\nupon and wrapping round the igneous rocks, _i_, and thus it becomes\r\nquite obvious that the latter occupy an intermediate position between\r\nthe greywacké and shale on the one hand, and the conglomerate and red\r\nsandstone upon the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Igneous rocks (_i_, _a_) resting on Greywacké\r\nand Shale, _g_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--_c_, Conglomerate and Sandstones, resting on\r\nIgneous rocks, _i_.]\r\n\r\nWe have now cleared the way so far, preparatory to an attempt to trace\r\nthe geological history of the Cheviots. The three sets of rocks,\r\nwhose mutual relations we have been studying, are those of which the\r\ndistrict is chiefly composed; but, as we shall see in the sequel,\r\nthere are others, not certainly of much extent, but nevertheless\r\nhaving an interesting story to tell us. Nor shall we omit to notice\r\nthe superficial accumulations of clay, gravel, sand, silt, alluvium,\r\nand peat; monuments as they are of certain great changes, climatic and\r\ngeographical, which have characterised not the Cheviots only, but a\r\nmuch wider area.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIf we draw a somewhat straight line from Girvan, on the coast of\r\nAyrshire, in a north-east direction to the shores of the North Sea,\r\nnear Dunbar, we shall find that south of that line, up to the English\r\nborder, nearly the whole country is composed of various kinds of\r\ngreywacké and shale like the basement beds of the Cheviot district.\r\nHere and there, however, especially in certain of the valleys and some\r\nof the low-lying portions of this southern section of Scotland, one\r\ncomes upon small isolated patches and occasional wider areas of younger\r\nstrata, which rest upon and conceal the greywackés and shales. Such is\r\nthe case in Teviotdale, the Cheviot district, and the country watered\r\nby the lower reaches of the Tweed, in which regions the bottom beds\r\nare hidden for several hundreds of square miles underneath younger\r\nrocks. Indeed, the greywacké and shale form but a very small portion of\r\nthe surface in the Cheviots, appearing upon a coloured geological map\r\nlike so many islands or fragments, as it were, which have somehow been\r\ndetached from the main masses of greywacké of which the Lammermuirs and\r\nthe uplands of Dumfries and Selkirk shires are composed. Although the\r\nbottom rocks of the Cheviot Hills are thus apparently separated from\r\nthe great greywacké area, there can be no doubt that they are really\r\nconnected with it, the connection being obscured by the overlying\r\nyounger strata. For if we could only strip off these latter, if we\r\ncould only lift aside the great masses of igneous rock and sandstone\r\nthat are piled up in the Cheviot Hills and the adjoining districts,\r\nwe should find that the bottom upon which these rest is everywhere\r\ngreywacké and shale. In part proof of this it may be mentioned that\r\nat various places in those districts which are entirely occupied by\r\nsandstone and igneous rock, the streams have cut right down through\r\nthe younger rocks so as to expose the bottom beds, as in Jed Water at\r\nAllars Mill. Again, when we trace out the boundaries of any detached\r\nareas of greywacké we invariably find these bottom beds disappearing on\r\nall sides underneath the younger strata by which they are surrounded.\r\nOne such isolated area occurs in the basin of the Oxnam Water, between\r\nLittletonleys and Bloodylaws, a section across which would exhibit\r\nthe general appearance shown in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 5).\r\nAnother similarly isolated patch is intersected by Edgerston Burn and\r\nthe Jed Water between Paton Haugh and Dovesford. But the largest of\r\nthese detached portions appears, forming the crest of the Cheviots,\r\nat the head of the River Coquet. There the basement beds occupy the\r\nwatershed, extending westward, some three or four miles, as far as\r\nthe sandstones of Hungry Law, while to the north and east they plunge\r\nunder the igneous rocks of Brownhart Law and the Hindhope Hills. Now\r\nit is evident that all those detached and isolated areas of greywacké\r\nand shale are really connected underground, and not only so, but they\r\nalso piece on in the same way to the great belt of similar strata\r\nthat stretches from sea to sea across the whole breadth of Scotland.\r\nIndeed, we may observe in the Cheviot district how long and massive\r\npromontories of greywacké jut out from that great belt, and extend\r\noften for miles into the areas that are covered with younger strata,\r\nas, for example, in the Brockilaw and Wolfelee Hills. A generalised\r\nsection across the greywacké regions of the Cheviot Hills would\r\ntherefore present the appearances shown in the annexed diagram (Fig.\r\n6), in which G represents the basement beds, I the igneous rocks, and C\r\nthe red sandstones, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Section across Greywacké area of Oxnam Water;\r\nG, Greywacké and Shale; C, Sandstone, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Diagram section across Greywacké districts of\r\nCheviot Hills.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the district under review the bottom beds\r\nare observed to dip at a high angle--the strata in many places being\r\nactually vertical--and the edges or crops of the strata run somewhat\r\npersistently in one direction, namely, from south by west to north\r\nby east; or, as a geologist would express it, the beds have an\r\napproximately south-west and north-east \"strike.\" Now as the dip is\r\nsometimes to north-west and sometimes to south-east, it is evident that\r\nthe rocks have been folded up in a series of rapid convolutions, and\r\nthat some of the beds must be often repeated.\r\n\r\nFrom the character of the fossils which the bottom beds have yielded\r\nwe learn that the strata belong to that division of past time\r\nwhich is known as the Silurian age. These fossils appear to be of\r\ninfrequent occurrence, and the creatures of which they are the relics\r\noccupied rather a humble place in the scale of being. They are called\r\n_graptolites_ (from their resemblance to pens), an extinct group of\r\nhydroid zoophytes, apparently resembling the sertularians of our own\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the Silurian strata of the Cheviots is\r\nindicative of deposition in comparatively quiet water, but how deep\r\nthat water was one cannot say. Upon the whole, the beds look not\r\nunlike the sediments that gather in calm reaches of the sea, such as\r\nestuaries, betokening the presence of some not distant land from which\r\nfine mud and sand were washed down. Another proof that some of the\r\nstrata at all events were accumulated not far from a shore-line, is\r\nfound in certain coarse bands of grit and pebbles, which are not likely\r\nto have been formed in deep water. This evidence, however, cannot be\r\nconsidered decisive, and in the present state of our knowledge all\r\nthat we can assert with anything like confidence is simply this:--That\r\nduring the deposition of the Silurian strata the whole of the Cheviot\r\narea lay under water--existed, in short, as a muddy sea-bottom, in the\r\nslime of which flourished here and there, in favourable spots, those\r\nminute hydroid animals called _graptolites_.\r\n\r\nBetween the deposition of the Silurian and the formation of the rocks\r\nthat come next in order a long interval elapsed, during which the mud,\r\nsand, and grit that gathered on the floor of the ancient sea were\r\nhardened into solid masses, and eventually squeezed together into great\r\nfolds and undulations. It has already been pointed out that these\r\nchanges could hardly have been effected save under extreme pressure,\r\nand this consideration leads us to infer that a great thickness of\r\nstrata has been removed entirely from the Cheviot district, so as to\r\nleave no trace of its former existence. Long before the deposition\r\nof the younger strata that now rest upon and conceal the Silurian\r\nrocks, the action of the denuding forces--the sea, frosts, rain, and\r\nrivers--had succeeded in not only sweeping gradually away the strata\r\nunderneath which the bottom beds were folded, but in deeply scarping\r\nand carving these bottom beds themselves. Can we form any reasonable\r\nconjecture as to the geological age of the strata underneath which the\r\nbottom beds of the Cheviots were folded, and which, as we have seen,\r\nhad entirely disappeared before the younger rocks of the district were\r\naccumulated? Well, it is obvious that the missing strata must have been\r\nof later formation than the bottom beds, and it is equally evident that\r\nthey must have been of much more ancient date than the igneous rocks of\r\nthe Cheviot Hills. Now, as we shall afterwards see, these igneous rocks\r\nbelong to the Old Red Sandstone age, that is to say, to the age that\r\nsucceeded the Silurian. How is it then, if the bottom beds be really\r\nof Silurian and the igneous rocks of Old Red Sandstone age, that a\r\ngap is said to exist between them? The explanation of this apparent\r\ncontradiction is not far to seek. When we compare the fossils that\r\noccur in the Silurian strata of the Cheviot Hills and the districts\r\nto the west, with the organic remains disinterred from similar strata\r\nelsewhere, as in Wales for example, we find that the bottom beds of\r\nthe Cheviots were in all probability accumulated at approximately the\r\nsame time as certain strata that occur in the middle division of the\r\nUpper Silurian. In Wales and in Cumberland the strata that approximate\r\nin age to the Silurian of the Cheviots are covered by younger strata\r\nbelonging to the same formation which reach a thickness of several\r\nthousand feet. It may quite well be, therefore, that the succession of\r\nSilurian strata in the Cheviots was at one time more complete than it\r\nis now. The upper portions of the formation which are so well developed\r\nin Wales and Cumberland, and which are likewise represented to a small\r\nextent in Scotland, had in all probability their equivalents in what\r\nare our border districts. In other words, there are good grounds for\r\nbelieving that the existing Silurian rocks of the Cheviots were in\r\ntimes preceding the Old Red Sandstone age covered with younger strata\r\nbelonging to the same great system. The missing Silurian strata of the\r\nCheviots may have attained a thickness of several thousand feet, and\r\nunderneath such a mass of solid rock the lower-lying strata might well\r\nhave been consolidated and subsequently squeezed into folds.\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to consider the next chapter in the geological history\r\nof the Cheviot Hills. As we proceed in our investigations it will\r\nbe noticed that the evidence becomes more abundant, and we are thus\r\nenabled to build up the story of the past with more confidence,\r\nand with fuller details. For it is with geological history as with\r\nhuman records--the further back we go in time the scantier do the\r\nfacts become. The rocks upon which Nature writes her own history\r\nare palimpsests, on which the later writing is ever the most easily\r\ndeciphered. Nay, she cannot compile her newer records without first\r\ndestroying some of those compiled in earlier times. The sediments\r\naccumulating in modern lake and sea are but the materials derived\r\nfrom the degradation of the rocks we see around us, just as these in\r\nlike manner have originated from the demolition of yet older strata.\r\nThus the further we trace back the history of our earth, the more\r\nfragmentary must we expect the evidence to be; and conversely, the\r\nnearer we approach to the present condition of things the more abundant\r\nand satisfactory must the records become. Accordingly, we find that\r\nthe igneous rocks of the Cheviot Hills tell us considerably more than\r\nthe ancient Silurian deposits upon which they rest. The surface of the\r\nlatter appears to be somewhat irregular underneath the igneous rocks,\r\nshowing that hills and valleys, or an undulating table-land, existed in\r\nthe Cheviot district prior to the appearance of the younger formation.\r\nBut before we attempt to summarise the history of that formation, it is\r\nnecessary to give some description, however short, of the rocks that\r\ncompose it.\r\n\r\nThese consist chiefly of numerous varieties of a rock called porphyrite\r\nby geologists, piled in more or less irregular beds, one on top of\r\nanother, in a somewhat confused manner. The colour of the freshly\r\nfractured rocks is very variable, being usually some shade of blue or\r\npurple; but pink, red, brown, greenish, and dark grey or almost black\r\nvarieties also occur. Some of the rocks are finely crystalline; others,\r\nagain, are much coarser, while many are compact, or nearly so, a lens\r\nbeing required to detect a crystalline texture. The mineral called\r\nfelspar is usually scattered more or less abundantly through the matrix\r\nor base, which itself is composed principally of felspathic materials.\r\nBesides distinct scattered crystals of felspar, other minerals often\r\noccur in a similar manner; mica and hornblende being the commonest.\r\nOccasionally the rocks contain numerous circular, oval, or flattened\r\ncavities, which are sometimes so abundant as to give the appearance\r\nof a kind of coarse slag to the porphyrite. These little cavities,\r\nhowever, are usually filled up with mineral matter--such as calcspar,\r\ncalcedony, jasper, quartz, etc. Sometimes also cracks, crannies, and\r\ncrevices of some size have been sealed up with similar minerals. Now\r\nnearly all these appearances are specially characteristic of rocks\r\nwhich have at one time been in a state of igneous fusion; nor can\r\nthere be any doubt that the Cheviot porphyrites are merely solidified\r\nlava-beds, which have been poured out from the bowels of the earth.\r\nIn modern lavas we may notice not only a crystalline texture, but\r\nfrequently also we observe those in our porphyrites. Such cavities are\r\ndue to the expansive force of the vapours imprisoned in the molten mass\r\nat the time of eruption. They form chiefly towards the upper surface of\r\na lava stream, and are often drawn out or flattened in the direction\r\nin which the lava flows. Thus a stream of lava, as it creeps on its\r\nway, becomes slaggy and scoriaceous or cindery above and in front, and\r\nas the molten mass within continues to flow, the slags and cinders\r\nthat cover its face tumble down before it, and form the pavement\r\nupon which the stream advances. In this way slags and cinders become\r\nincorporated with the bottom of the lava, and hence it is that so many\r\nvolcanic rocks are scoriaceous, as well below as above. The vapours\r\nwhich produce the cavities usually contain minerals in solution, and\r\nthese, as the lava cools, are frequently deposited, partially filling\r\nup the vesicles, so as to form what are called geodes. But many of\r\nthe cavities have been filled in another way--by the subsequent\r\ninfiltration of water carrying mineral matter in solution. And since\r\nwe know that all rocks are so permeated by water, it is clear that\r\nthe cavities may have received their contents during many successive\r\nperiods, after the solidification of the rock in which they occur. It\r\nis in this manner that the jaspers, calcedony, and beautiful agates of\r\ncommerce have been formed. Rocks abundantly charged with cavities are\r\nsaid to be _vesicular_, and when the vesicles are filled with mineral\r\nmatter, then the mass becomes, in geological language, _amygdaloidal_,\r\nfrom the almond-like shape assumed by the flattened vesicles.\r\n\r\nNow all the appearances described above, and many others hardly\r\nless characteristic of true lavas, are to be met with amongst those\r\nporphyrites which, as I have said, form the major portion of the\r\nCheviot Hills. From the valley of the Oxnam, east by Cessford,\r\nMorebattle, and Hoselaw, and south by Edgerston, Letham, Browndeanlaws,\r\nand Hindhope, the porphyrites extend over the whole area, sweeping\r\nnorth-east across the border on to the heights above the Rivers Glen\r\nand Till. In the hills at Hindhope we notice a good display of the\r\noldest beds of the series. At the base occurs a very peculiar rock\r\nresting upon the Silurian, and thus forming the foundation of the\r\nporphyrites. It varies in colour, being pink, grey, green, red, brown,\r\nor variously mottled. Sometimes it is fine-grained and gritty, like\r\na soft, coarse-grained sandstone; at other times it is not unlike a\r\ngranular porphyrite; but when most typically developed it consists of a\r\nkind of coarse angular gravel embedded in a gritty matrix. The stones\r\nsometimes show distinct traces of arrangement into layers; but they are\r\noften heaped rudely together with little or no stratification at all.\r\nThey consist chiefly of fragments of porphyrites; but bits of Silurian\r\nrocks also occur amongst them. This peculiar deposit unquestionably\r\nanswers to the heaps of dust, sand, stones, and bombs which are shot\r\nout of modern volcanoes; it is a true tuff--that is, a collection of\r\nloose volcanic ejectamenta.\r\n\r\nUpon what kind of surface did it fall? Long before the eruptions began,\r\nthe Silurian rocks had been sculptured into hills and valleys by the\r\naction chiefly of the sub-aërial forces, and it was upon these hills\r\nand in these valleys that the igneous materials accumulated. It is\r\ndifficult to say, however, whether at this period the Cheviot district\r\nwas above or under water. The traces of bedding in the tuff would seem\r\nto indicate the assorting power of water; but the evidence is too\r\nslight to found upon, because we know that in modern eruptions, loose\r\nejectamenta frequently assume a kind of irregular bedded arrangement.\r\nFor aught we can say to the contrary, therefore, dry land may have\r\nextended across what is now southern Scotland and northern England\r\nwhen the first rumblings of volcanic disturbance shook the Cheviot\r\narea. Be that as it may, we know that the volcanic outbursts began in\r\nthose old times, as they almost invariably commence now, by a discharge\r\nof sand, small stones, blocks, and cinders. These, we may infer,\r\ncovered a wide area round the centre of dispersion--the chief focus\r\nof eruption being probably in the vicinity of the big Cheviot, where\r\na mass of granite seems to occupy the core or deep-seated portion of\r\nthe old volcanic centre. The locality where the tuff occurs is some\r\nnine miles or so distant from this point, and the intervening ground\r\ncould hardly have escaped being more or less thickly sprinkled with\r\nthe same materials. The whole of that intervening ground, however, now\r\nlies deeply buried under the massive streams of once-molten rock that\r\nfollowed in succession after the first dispersion of stones and débris.\r\nAlthough, as I have said, it may be doubted whether at the beginning of\r\ntheir activity the Cheviot volcanoes were sub-aqueous, yet there are\r\nnot a few facts that lead to the inference that the eruption of the\r\nporphyrites took place for the most part, if not exclusively, under\r\nwater. The beds are occasionally separated by layers of sandstone,\r\ngrit, and conglomerate; but such beds are rare, and true tuffs are\r\nrarer still. If the outbursts had been sub-aërial, we ought surely to\r\nhave met with these latter in greater abundance, while we should hardly\r\nhave expected to find such evidently water-arranged strata as do occur\r\nhere and there. The porphyrites themselves present certain appearances\r\nwhich lead to the same conclusion. Thus we may observe how the bottoms\r\nof the beds frequently contain baked or hardened sand and mud, showing\r\nthat the molten rock had been poured out over some muddy or sandy\r\nbottom, and had caught up and enclosed the soft, sedimentary materials,\r\nwhich now bear all the marks of having been subjected to the action\r\nof intense heat. Sometimes, indeed, the old lava-streams seem to have\r\nlicked up beds of unconsolidated gravel, the water-worn stones being\r\nnow scattered through their under portions. As no fossils occur in any\r\nof the beds associated with the porphyrites, one cannot say whether\r\nthe latter flowed into the sea or into great freshwater lakes. Neither\r\ncan we be certain that towards their close the eruptions were not\r\nsub-aërial. They may quite well have been so. The porphyrites attain\r\na thickness of probably not less than fifteen hundred or two thousand\r\nfeet, and the beds which we now see are only the basal, and therefore\r\nthe older portions of the old volcanoes. The upper parts have long\r\nsince disappeared, the waste of the igneous masses having been so great\r\nthat only the very oldest portions now remain, and these, again, are\r\nhewn and carved into hill and valley. Any loose accumulation of stones\r\nand débris, therefore, which may have been thrown out in the later\r\nstages of the eruptions, must long ere this have utterly disappeared.\r\nWe can point to the beds which mark the beginning of volcanic activity\r\nin the Cheviots; we can prove that volcanoes continued in action there\r\nfor long ages, great streams of lava being poured out--the eruptions of\r\nwhich were preceded and sometimes succeeded by showers of stones and\r\ndébris; we can show, also, that periods of quiescence, more or less\r\nprolonged, occasionally intervened, at which times water assorted the\r\nsand and mud, and rounded the stones, spreading them out in layers.\r\nBut whether this water action took place in the sea or in a lake we\r\ncannot tell. Indeed, for aught one can say, some of the masses of\r\nrounded stones I refer to may point to the action of mountain torrents,\r\nand thus be part evidence that the volcanoes were sub-aërial. If we\r\nare thus in doubt as to some of the physical conditions that obtained\r\nin the Cheviot district during the accumulation of the porphyrites\r\nand their associated beds, we are left entirely to conjecture when\r\nwe seek to inquire into the conditions that prevailed towards the\r\nclose of the volcanic period. For just as we have proof that before\r\nthis period began the Silurian strata had been subjected to the most\r\nintense denudation--had, in short, been worn into hill and valley--so\r\ndo we learn from abundant evidence that the rocks representing the old\r\nvolcanoes of the Cheviots are merely the wrecks of formerly extensive\r\nmasses. Not only have the upper portions of these volcanoes been swept\r\naway, but their lower portions, likewise, have been deeply incised, and\r\nthousands of feet of solid rock have been carried off by the denuding\r\nforces. And by much the greater part of all this waste took place\r\nbefore the accumulation of those sandstones which now rest upon the\r\nworn outskirts of the old volcanic region.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nSome reference has already been made (see p. 64) to the general\r\nappearance presented by the valleys of the Cheviots. In their upper\r\nreaches they are often rough and craggy; narrow dells, in fact, flanked\r\nwith steep shingle-covered slopes, and occasionally overlooked by\r\nbeetling cliffs, or fringed with lofty scaurs of decomposing rocks. As\r\nwe follow down the valleys they gradually widen out; the hill-slopes\r\nbecoming less steep, and retiring from the stream so as to leave a\r\nnarrow strip of meadow-land through which the clear waters canter gaily\r\non to the low grounds of the Teviot. In their middle reaches these\r\nupland dales are not infrequently well cultivated to a considerable\r\nheight, as in the districts between Hownam and Morebattle, and between\r\nBelford and Yetholm--the former in the valley of the Kale, and the\r\nlatter in that of the Bowmont. It is noticeable that all the narrower\r\nand steeper reaches lie among Silurian strata and Old Red Sandstone\r\nporphyrites. No sooner do we leave the regions occupied by these tough\r\nand hard rock-masses than the whole aspect of the scenery changes.\r\nThe surrounding hills immediately lose in height and fall away into a\r\nsoftly undulating country, through which the streams and rivers have\r\ndug for themselves deep romantic channels. Nevertheless, it is a fact,\r\nas we shall see by-and-by, that south-west of the region occupied by\r\nthe igneous rocks of the Cheviot Hills, all the higher portions of\r\nthe range (Hungry Law, Carter Fell, Peel Fell, etc.) are built up of\r\nsandstones. For the present, however, I confine attention to those\r\nvalleys whose upper reaches lie either wholly or in part among igneous\r\nrocks or Silurian strata. A typical and certainly the most beautiful\r\nexample is furnished us by the vale of the River Jed. This stream\r\nrises among the sandstone heights which have just been mentioned as\r\ncomposing the south-west portion of the Cheviot range. The first seven\r\nor eight miles of its course lead us through a broad open valley, which\r\nhas been hollowed out almost exclusively in sandstones and shales;\r\nby-and-by, however, we are led into a Silurian tract, and thereupon\r\nthe valley contracts and the hill-slopes descend more steeply to the\r\nstream. But we soon leave the grassy glades of this Silurian tract and\r\nenter all at once upon what may be termed the lower reaches of the\r\nJed. No longer cooped up in the rocky gully, painfully worn for itself\r\nin the hard greywacké and shales, the stream now winds through a much\r\ndeeper and broader channel which has evidently been excavated with\r\ngreater ease. Precipitous banks and scaurs here overlook the river at\r\nevery bend, the banks becoming higher and higher and retiring further\r\nand further from each other, as the water glides on its way, until at\r\nlast they fairly open upon the broad vale of the Teviot. Sometimes the\r\nriver flows along one side of its valley for a considerable distance,\r\nand whenever this is the case, it gives us a line of bold cliffs which\r\nare usually flanked on the opposite side by sloping ground. This is\r\nthe general character of all valleys of erosion, and especially of the\r\nlower reaches of the Jed.\r\n\r\nA glance at the cliffs and scaurs of the Jed shows that they consist of\r\nhorizontal or gently undulating strata of soft earthy, friable, shaly\r\nsandstone, arranged in thin beds and bands, which alternate rapidly\r\nwith crumbling, sandy, and earthy shales; the whole forming a loose\r\nand unconsolidated mass that readily becomes a prey to the action of\r\nthe weather, rain, frost, and running water. The prevailing colour is\r\na dull red, but pale yellow, white, green, and purple discolorations\r\nare visible when the strata are closely scanned. The finest sections\r\noccur between Glen Douglas and Inchbonnie, and at Mossburnford, but\r\nthe cliffs throughout present the same general appearance, and are\r\npicturesque in the highest degree. Everywhere the banks are thickly\r\nwooded, and even the steep red scaurs are dashed and flecked with\r\ngreenery, which droops and springs from every ledge and crevice in\r\nwhich a root can fix itself. How vivid and striking is the contrast\r\nbetween the fresh delicate green of early summer and the rich warm\r\ntint of these rocks, which when lit up by the setting sun seem almost\r\nto glow and burn! Well may the good folk of Jedburgh be proud of the\r\nlovely valley in which their lot is cast. In no similar district in\r\nScotland will the artist meet with a greater number of such \"delicious\r\nbits,\" in which all the charms of wood and water, of meadow and rock\r\nare so harmoniously combined. It is not with the scenic beauties of\r\nthe Jed, however, that we have at present to do. I wish the reader\r\nto examine with me certain appearances visible at the base of the\r\nred beds, where these rest upon those older rocks which have formed\r\nthe subject of the preceding papers. In the bed of the river at\r\nJedburgh, we see the junction between the red beds and the Silurian\r\nstrata, and may observe how the bottom portions of the former, which\r\nrepose immediately upon the greywackés, are abundantly charged with\r\nwell-rounded and water-worn stones. Many of these stones consist of\r\ngreywacké, hardened grit, and other kinds of rock, and most of them\r\nundoubtedly have been derived from Silurian strata. In other districts\r\nwhere the old igneous rocks of the Cheviots form the pavement upon\r\nwhich the red beds repose, the stones in the lower portions of the\r\nlatter are made up chiefly of rounded fragments of the underlying\r\nporphyrites. All which clearly shows that the red beds have been\r\nbuilt out of the ruins of the older strata of the district. This is\r\nunquestionably the origin not only of the conglomerates, but of all\r\nthe red beds through which the River Jed cuts its way from the base\r\nof the hills to the Teviot. When we trace out the boundary of these\r\nbeds, we find that this leads us along the base of the hills, close to\r\nthe hill-foot; and not only so, but it frequently takes us into the\r\nhill-valleys also. And this shows that the Cheviots had already been\r\ndeeply excavated by streams before any portion of the red beds was\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nI have said that the red beds are approximately horizontal; sometimes,\r\nhowever, they have a decided _dip_ or inclination, and when this is\r\ncontinuous, it is invariably in a direction away from the hills. Thus\r\nas we traverse the ground from the hill-foot to the Teviot, we pass\r\nover the outcrops of the red beds and slowly rise from a lower to a\r\nhigher geological position. The strata, however, are generally so\r\nflat that their dip is often not greater than the average slope or\r\ninclination of the ground. Hence when we ascend the valley-slopes\r\nfrom the stream, we soon reach the higher beds of the series, as,\r\nfor example, in the undulating heights that overlook the Jed in the\r\nneighbourhood of Jedburgh. In that district a number of quarries\r\nhave been opened, in which the upper beds of the red series are well\r\nexposed, as at Ferniehirst, Tudhope, etc. These consist of thick beds\r\nof greyish white, yellowish, and reddish sandstones, which, unlike\r\nthe crumbling earthy deposits below, are quite suitable for building\r\npurposes. Scales of fish and plant remains are often met with in the\r\nthick sandstones, but the underlying earthy, friable red beds appear to\r\nbe quite destitute of any organic remains.\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly recapitulate the main facts we have just\r\nascertained. They are these:--1. All the low grounds that abut upon the\r\nhills are composed of horizontal or nearly horizontal strata, which\r\nconsist chiefly of red earthy beds, passing down into conglomerates,\r\nand up into whitish and reddish sandstones. 2. The conglomeratic\r\nportion forms the boundary of the series, fringing the outskirts of the\r\nhills, and resting sometimes upon Silurian strata and sometimes upon\r\nOld Red Sandstone igneous rocks. 3. Fossils occur in the white and red\r\nsandstones, but seem to be wanting in the underlying red earthy beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--S, Silurian strata; _i_, Old Red Sandstone\r\nIgneous Rocks; _a^1_, Conglomerate; _a^2_, Red earthy beds; _a^3_,\r\nWhite and Red Sandstones.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Fig. 7) gives a generalised view of the\r\nrelation borne by the red beds to the older rocks of the Cheviots.\r\nIt will be seen that the former rest _unconformably_ upon the Old\r\nRed Sandstone igneous rocks, and also, of course, upon the Silurian\r\nstrata. The section shows that the red beds lie upon a worn and\r\ndenuded surface. Now this speaks to the lapse of a long period of\r\ntime. It may be remembered that we had some grounds for believing that\r\nthe latest eruptions of the Cheviot volcanoes were sub-aërial. The\r\nevidence now enables us to advance further, and to state that after\r\nthe close of the volcanic period, the whole Cheviot district existed\r\nas an elevated tract of dry land, from which streams flowed north and\r\nsouth. And for so long a time did these conditions endure, that the\r\nrivulets and streams were enabled to scoop out many channels and broad\r\nvalleys before any of the outlying red beds had come into existence.\r\nBefore the conglomerate beds were laid down, the ancient volcanic\r\nbank of the Cheviots had thus suffered great erosion. This is what\r\n\"unconformability\" means. It points to the prolonged continuance of\r\na land-surface, subject as that must always be to the wearing action\r\nof the sub-aërial forces. Rain and frost disintegrate the rocks, and\r\nrunning water rolls the débris from higher to lower levels, and piles\r\nit up in the form of gravel, sand, and mud in lakes and the sea. While\r\nthe old volcanic country of the Cheviots was being thus denuded,\r\nit would appear that a wide extent of land existed in the Northern\r\nHighlands and Southern Uplands of Scotland, and also in what are now\r\nthe lake districts of England and the hilly tracts of Wales. And in all\r\nthese regions valleys were formed, which at a subsequent time were more\r\nor less filled up with newer deposits.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the red beds that sweep round the base of the Cheviot\r\nHills shows unmistakably that a period of submergence followed these\r\nland conditions. All the low grounds of Southern Scotland disappeared\r\nbeneath a wide sheet of water, which stretched from the foot of the\r\nLammermuirs up to the base of the Cheviots, and here and there entered\r\nthe valleys, and so extended into the hills. This water, however, does\r\nnot seem to have been that of an open sea; rather was it portion of a\r\ngreat freshwater lake, brackish lagoon, or inland sea. The lowest beds\r\nof the red series are merely hardened layers and masses of gravel and\r\nrolled shingle, which would seem at first sight to indicate the former\r\naction of waves along a sea-beach. There are certain appearances,\r\nhowever, which lead one to suspect that these ancient shingle beds\r\nmay have had quite another origin. In some places the stones exactly\r\nresemble those which are found so abundantly in glacial deposits. They\r\nare sub-angular and blunted, and, like glaciated stones, occasionally\r\nshow striæ or scratches. This, however, is very rarely the case. Most\r\nof the stones appear subsequently to have been rolled about in water,\r\nand in this process they must have lost any ice-markings they may have\r\nhad, and become smoothed and rounded like ordinary gravel stones.\r\nThe same appearances may be noted in the glacier valleys of Norway\r\nand Switzerland, where at the present day the glaciated stones which\r\nare pushed out at the lower ends of the glaciers are rolled about in\r\nthe streams, and soon lose all trace of ice-work. It is impossible,\r\nhowever, to enter here into all the details of the evidence which lead\r\none to suspect that glaciers may have existed at this early period\r\namong the Cheviot and Lammermuir Hills. In the latter district, the\r\nconglomerates occur in such masses and so exactly resemble the morainic\r\ndébris and ice-rubbish of modern glacial regions, that the late Sir A.\r\nC. Ramsay long ago suggested their ice-origin.\r\n\r\nLet us conceive, then, that when the ancient lake or inland sea of\r\nwhich I have spoken reached the base of the Cheviots, glaciers may\r\nhave nestled in the valleys. Streams issuing from the lower ends of\r\nthese would sweep great quantities of gravel down the valleys to the\r\nmargin of the lake, and it is quite possible that there might be enough\r\nwave-action to spread the gravel out along the shores. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that the main heaps of shingle would gather opposite what were\r\nat that time the mouths of glacier valleys; and it is just in such\r\npositions that we now meet with the thickest masses of conglomerate.\r\nEre long, however, the supposed glaciers would seem to have melted\r\naway, and only fine sand and mud, with here and there small rounded\r\nstones and grit, accumulated round the shores of the ancient lake. Of\r\ncourse, during all this time fine-grained sediment gathered over the\r\ndeeper parts of the lake-bottom.\r\n\r\nWe have no evidence to show what kind of creatures, if any, inhabited\r\nthe land at this time; nor do any fossils occur in the red earthy beds\r\nto throw light upon the conditions of life that may have obtained in\r\nthe lake. If glaciers really existed and sent down ice-cold water,\r\nthe conditions would hardly be favourable to life of any kind; for\r\nglacial lakes are generally barren. But the absence of fossils may\r\nbe due to other causes than this. It is a remarkable fact, that red\r\nstrata are, as a rule, unfossiliferous, and the few fossils which\r\nthey do sometimes yield are generally indicative rather of lacustrine\r\nand brackish-water, than marine conditions. The paucity or absence of\r\norganic remains seems to have been often due to the presence in the\r\nwater of a superabundance of salts. Now this excessive salinity may\r\nhave arisen in either of two ways. First, we may suppose some wide\r\nreach of the sea to have been cut off from communication with the\r\nopen ocean by an elevation of a portion of its bed; and in this case\r\nwe should have a lagoon of saltwater, which evaporation would tend to\r\nconcentrate to such a degree, that by-and-by nothing would be able to\r\nlive in its waters. Or, again, we may have a lake so poisoned by the\r\ninflux of springs and streams, carrying various salts in solution,\r\nas to render it uninhabitable by life of any kind, either animal or\r\nvegetable. Many red sandstone deposits, as Sir A. C. Ramsay has pointed\r\nout, are evidently lagoon-formations, which is proved by the presence\r\nof associated beds of rock-salt, gypsum, and magnesian limestone.\r\nThey have slowly accumulated in great inland seas or lakes having no\r\noutlet, whose waters were subject to evaporation and concentration,\r\nalthough now and then they seem to have communicated more or less\r\nfreely with the ocean. The red earthy beds of the Jed, however, though\r\nunfossiliferous, yet contain no trace of rock-salt or magnesian\r\nlimestone. The only character they have in common with the salt-bearing\r\nstrata of the New Red Sandstone of England is their colour, due to\r\nthe presence of peroxide of iron, which we can hardly conceive could\r\nhave been deposited in the mud of a sea communicating freely with the\r\nocean. But a quiet lake, fed by rivulets and streams that drained an\r\nold volcanic district, is precisely the kind of water-basin in which\r\nhighly ferruginous mud and sand might be expected to accumulate. Such\r\na lake, tainted with the various salts, etc., carried into it by\r\nstreams and springs (some of which may have been thermal; for, as we\r\nshall see presently, the volcanic forces, although quiescent, were yet\r\nnot extinct), might well be unfitted for either animal or plant, and\r\nprobably this is one reason why the red earthy beds of the Jed are so\r\nunfossiliferous.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, the physical conditions in the regions under review\r\nexperienced some further modification. Considerable depression of the\r\nland supervened, and the waters of our inland sea or lake rose high on\r\nthe slopes of the Cheviots. Mark now how the character of the sediment\r\nchanges. The prevailing red colour has disappeared, and white, yellow,\r\nand pale greenish or grey sand begins to be poured over the bed of\r\nthe lake. Even yet, however, ferruginous matter exists in sufficient\r\nquantity to tint the sediment red in some places. With the appearance\r\nof these lighter-coloured sandy deposits, the conditions seem to have\r\nbecome better fitted to sustain life. Fish of peculiar forms, which,\r\nlike the gar-pike of North American lakes, were provided with a strong\r\nscaly armour of tough bone, began to abound, weeds grew in the water,\r\nand the neighbouring land supported a vegetation now very meagrely\r\nrepresented by the few remains of plants which have been preserved.\r\nIn some places fish-scales are found in considerable abundance.\r\nThey belong to several genera and species which are more or less\r\ncharacteristic of the Old Red Sandstone formation. The most remarkable\r\nform was the _Pterichthys_, or wing-finned fish. Its blunt-shaped head\r\nand the anterior portion of its body were sheathed in a solid case\r\nof bone, formed by the union of numerous bony scales or plates. Two\r\ncurious curved spine-like arms occupied the place of pectoral fins,\r\nand may have been used by the creature in paddling along the bottom of\r\nthe sea or lake in which it lived. The posterior part of the body was\r\ncovered with bony scales, but these were not suturally united. Other\r\nkinds of fish were the _Holoptychius_ and _Coccosteus_, both of which\r\nwere, like the Pterichthys, furnished with bony scales. The scales of\r\nthe former overlapped, and had a curious wrinkled surface. The head of\r\nthe Coccosteus was protected by a large bony shield or buckler, and a\r\nsimilar bony armour covered the ventral region.\r\n\r\nThe organic remains of these fish-bearing strata are too scanty,\r\nhowever, to enable us to form any idea of the kind of climate which\r\ncharacterised the district at this long-past period; but if we rely\r\nupon the fossils which have been met with in strata of the same or\r\napproximately the same age elsewhere, we may be pretty sure the\r\nclimate was genial, and nourished on the land an abundant vegetation,\r\nconsisting of ferns, great reeds, and club-mosses, which attained the\r\ndimensions of large trees, conifers, and other strange trees which have\r\nno living analogues.\r\n\r\nIt seems most likely that when the land sank down in the Cheviot\r\ndistrict, so as to allow the old lake to reach as it were a higher\r\nlevel, some communication with the outlying ocean was effected. Red\r\nferruginous mud would then cease to accumulate, or gather only now\r\nand then; the deposits would for the most part be white or yellow,\r\nor pale green; and fish would be able to come in from the sea. The\r\ncommunication with the ocean, however, was probably never very free,\r\nbut liable to frequent interruption.\r\n\r\nHere, then, ends the third great period of time represented by the\r\nrocks of the Cheviot district. The first period, as we have seen,\r\nclosed with the deposition of the Silurian strata. Thereafter\r\nsupervened a vast lapse of time, not recorded in the Cheviots by the\r\npresence of any rocks, but represented in other regions by younger\r\nmembers of the Silurian system. During this unrecorded portion of past\r\ntime, the Silurian strata of the Cheviots were hardened, compressed,\r\nfolded, upheaved to the light of day, and worn into hills and valleys\r\nby the action of the sub-aërial forces. Then began the second period\r\nof rock-forming in our district. Volcanoes poured out successive beds\r\nof molten matter and showers of stones and ashes, and so built up the\r\nrock-masses of the highest parts of the Cheviot Hills. These eruptions\r\nbelong to the Old Red Sandstone age, and form a portion of what we term\r\nthe Lower Old Red Sandstone. After the extinction of the volcanoes,\r\nanother prolonged period elapsed, which is not accounted for in the\r\nCheviots by the presence of any rocks. Then it was, as we know, that\r\nthe great volcanic bank was denuded and worn into a system of hills\r\nand valleys. Now, since it is evident that the red beds of the Jed and\r\nother places are also of Old Red Sandstone age, it follows that they\r\nmust belong to a higher place in the Old Red Sandstone formation than\r\nthe much-denuded igneous rocks upon which they rest unconformably.\r\nThe reasonable conclusion seems to be that the denudation or wearing\r\naway of the Lower Old Red Sandstone igneous rocks of the Cheviots was\r\neffected during that period which is represented in other districts of\r\nScotland by what is called the Middle Old Red Sandstone, so that the\r\nJed beds will thus rank as Upper Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--_s_, Silurian strata; _i_, Cheviot Igneous\r\nRocks (Lower Old Red Sandstone); _r_, Upper Old Red Sandstone\r\nseries; _c_, Kelso Igneous Rocks (Lower Carboniferous); _d_, Lower\r\nCarboniferous Sandstones, Shales, etc.]\r\n\r\nI come now to speak of certain rocks which, although they are developed\r\nchiefly beyond the limits of our district, yet require a little\r\nconsideration before we can complete our account of the geological\r\nhistory of the Cheviots. The rocks referred to consist chiefly of old\r\nlava-beds, which very closely resemble those of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone. They appear on the south side of the Tweed valley below\r\nKelso, whence they extend south-west and west, crossing the river at\r\nMakerstoun, and sweeping north to form the hills about Smailholm,\r\nStichill, and Hume (Fig. 8). All to the east of these rocks, the valley\r\nof the Tweed is occupied by a great thickness of grey sandstones,\r\nand grey and blue shales and clays, with which are associated thin\r\ncement-stone bands, and occasional coarse sandy limestones called\r\ncornstone. These strata rest upon the outskirts of the Kelso igneous\r\nrocks, and are clearly of later date than these, since in their lower\r\nbeds, which are often conglomeratic, we find numerous rounded fragments\r\nof the igneous rocks upon which the sandstones and shales abut. The\r\nlatter have yielded a number of fossils, both animals and plants, to\r\nwhich I shall refer presently. In the bed of the Teviot near Roxburgh,\r\nand elsewhere, the Kelso igneous rocks are found reposing upon whitish\r\nand reddish sandstones, which are evidently the upper members of the\r\nred beds of the Jed Water and other localities.\r\n\r\nStrata closely resembling the grey sandstones and shales of the Tweed\r\nvalley appear among the Cheviot Hills at the head of the Jed Water,\r\nwhere they are marked by the presence of thick massive sandstones,\r\nwhich form all the tops of the hills between Hungry Law and the heights\r\nthat overlook the sources of the Liddel Water--the greatest height\r\nreached being at Carter Fell, which is 1815 feet above the sea-level.\r\nThe strata at this place contain some impure limestone and thin seams\r\nof coal, while beds of lava and tuff appear intercalated in the series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Section across old volcanic neck. The dotted\r\nline above suggests the original form of the volcano; _b_, plug of\r\nigneous rock which rose in a molten state and cooled in the vent.]\r\n\r\nNow let us rapidly sum up what seem to be the inferences suggested\r\nby these briefly-stated facts. We have seen that the Upper Old Red\r\nSandstone began to be deposited in a lake which, as time wore on,\r\nprobably communicated with the sea, while the land was undergoing a\r\nprocess of depression, so that the area of deposition was thus widely\r\nincreased, and sediment gradually accumulated in places and at levels\r\nwhich had existed as land when the ancient lake first appeared in the\r\nCheviot district. The old lava-beds of Kelso show that the volcanic\r\nforces, which had long been quiescent, again became active. Great\r\nfloods of molten matter issued from the bowels of the earth, and poured\r\nover the bottom of the inland sea. But all the larger volcanoes of this\r\nperiod were confined to the centre of the Tweed valley. Not a few\r\nlittle isolated volcanoes, however, seem to have dotted the sea-bottom\r\nbeyond the limits of the Kelso area. From these, showers of stones\r\nwere ejected, and sometimes also they poured out molten matter. Their\r\nsites are now represented by rounded hills which stand up, more or\r\nless abruptly, above the level of the undulating tracts in which they\r\noccur (Fig. 9). Among the most marked are Rubers Law, Black Law, the\r\nDunian, and Lanton Hill. Of course it is only the plugged-up vents or\r\nnecks that now remain; all the loose ejectamenta by which these must\r\nat one time have been surrounded have long since been worn and washed\r\naway. At last the Kelso volcanoes became extinct, and the little ones\r\nalso probably died out at the same time. Another long period now\r\nensued, during which the inland sea disappeared, and its dried-up bed\r\nwas subjected to the denuding action of the sub-aërial forces. The\r\nvolcanic rocks of the Kelso district suffered considerable erosion,\r\nwhile the softer sandy strata amongst which they were erupted no doubt\r\nexperienced still greater waste. Ere long, however, the scene again\r\nchanges; and what is now the vale of Tweed becomes a wide estuary,\r\nthe shores of which are formed at first by the Kelso igneous rocks.\r\nInto this estuary, rivers and streams carry the spoil of the Southern\r\nUplands, and strew its bed with sand and mud. Occasionally ferns and\r\nlarge coniferous trees are floated down, and, getting water-logged,\r\nsink to the bottom, where they become entombed in the slowly\r\naccumulating sediment. The character of these buried plants shows that\r\nthe climate must have been genial. They belong to species which are\r\ncharacteristic of the Carboniferous system, and we look upon them with\r\ninterest as the forerunners of that vast plant-growth which by-and-by\r\nwas to cover wide areas in Britain, and to give rise to our coal-seams,\r\nthe source of so much national wealth. In the waters of the estuary,\r\nminute crustaceous creatures called _cyprides_ abounded, and with these\r\nwas associated a number of small molluscs, chiefly univalves. Here\r\nand there considerable quantities of calcareous mud and sand gathered\r\non the bed of the estuary, and formed in time beds of cement-stone,\r\nand impure limestone or cornstone. How long that condition of things\r\nobtained in the Tweed valley we cannot tell; but we know that after\r\na very considerable thickness of sediment had accumulated, estuarine\r\nconditions prevailed over the south-west end of what is now the Cheviot\r\nrange. This points to a considerable depression of the land. In this\r\nsame region volcanic action appeared, and streams of lava and showers\r\nof fragmental materials were ejected--the remains of which are seen\r\nin Hungry Law, Catcleugh Shin, and the head-waters of the Jed. Genial\r\nclimatic conditions continued; and here and there, along what were\r\neither low islets or the flat muddy shores of the estuary, plants grew\r\nin sufficient quantity to form masses of vegetation which, subsequently\r\nburied under mud and sand, were compressed and mineralised, and so\r\nbecame coal. The only place where these are now met with is on the\r\ncrest of the Cheviots at Carter Fell. The process of depression still\r\ncontinuing, thick sand gradually spread over the site of the submerged\r\nforests. To trace the physical history immediately after this, we must\r\ngo out of the Cheviot district; and it may suffice if I merely state\r\nthat these estuarine or lacustrine conditions, which prevailed for a\r\nlong time not only over the Tweed and Cheviot areas but in various\r\nother parts of Scotland, at last gave place to the sea. In this sea,\r\ncorals, sea-lilies, and numerous molluscs and fishes abounded--all\r\npointing to the prevalence of genial climatic conditions. The organic\r\nremains and the geological position of the estuarine beds of the\r\nTweed and the Cheviots--resting as they do upon the Upper Old Red\r\nSandstone--prove them to belong to the Lower series of the great\r\nCarboniferous system.\r\n\r\nIt was some time during the Carboniferous period that wide sheets of\r\nmelted matter were forcibly intruded among the Old Red Sandstone and\r\nthe Lower Carboniferous strata of the Cheviot district; but although\r\nthese are now visible at the surface, as at Southdean, Bonchester,\r\netc., they never actually reached that surface at the time of their\r\nirruption. They cooled in the crust of the earth amongst the strata\r\nbetween which they were intruded, and have only been exposed to view by\r\nthe action of the denuding forces which have worn away the sedimentary\r\nbeds by which they were formerly covered.\r\n\r\nA very wide blank next occurs in the geological history of the\r\nCheviots. We have no trace of the many great systems, comprising\r\nvast series of strata and representing long eras of time, which we\r\nknow, from the evidence supplied by other regions, followed after the\r\ndeposition of the Lower Carboniferous strata. The Middle and Upper\r\nCarboniferous groups are totally wanting, so likewise is the Permian\r\nsystem; and all the great series of \"Secondary\" systems, of which the\r\nmajor portion of England is composed, are equally absent. Nay, even\r\nTertiary accumulations are wanting. There is one very remarkable relic,\r\nhowever, of Tertiary times, and that is a long dyke or vertical wall\r\nof basalt-rock which traverses the country from east to west, crossing\r\nthe crest of the Cheviots near Brownhart Law, and striking west by\r\nnorth through Belling Hill, by the Rule Water at Hallrule Mill, on\r\ntowards Hawick. This is one of a series of such dykes, common enough\r\nin some parts of Scotland, which become more numerous as we approach\r\nthe west coast, where they are found associated with certain volcanic\r\nrocks of Tertiary age, in such a way as to lead to the belief that they\r\nall belong to the same period. The melted rock seems to have risen\r\nand cooled in great cracks or fissures, and seldom to have overflowed\r\nat the surface. Indeed it is highly probable that many or even most\r\nof the dykes never reached the surface at all, but have been exposed\r\nby subsequent denudation of the rocks that once overlaid them. Such\r\nwould appear to have been the case with the great dyke of the Cheviot\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nWe can only conjecture what the condition of this part of southern\r\nScotland was in the long ages that elapsed between the termination of\r\nthe Lower Carboniferous period and the close of the Tertiary ages. It\r\nis more than likely that it shared in some of the submergences that\r\nensued during the deposition of the upper group of the Carboniferous\r\nsystem; but after that it may have remained, for aught we can tell, in\r\nthe condition of dry land all through those prolonged periods which\r\nare unrecorded in the rocks of the Cheviot Hills, but have left behind\r\nthem such noteworthy remains in England and other countries. Of one\r\nthing we may be sure, that during a large part of those unrecorded ages\r\nthe Cheviot district could not have been an area of deposition. Rather\r\nmust it have existed for untold eras as dry land; and this explains\r\nand accounts for the enormous denudation which the whole country has\r\nexperienced; for there can be little doubt that the Lower Carboniferous\r\nstrata of Carter Fell were at one time continuous with the similar\r\nstrata of the lower reaches of the Tweed valley. Yet hardly a trace of\r\nthe missing beds remains in any part of the country between the ridge\r\nof the hills at the head of the Jed Water and the Tweed at Kelso. Only\r\nlittle patches are found capping the high ground opposite Jedburgh, as\r\nat Hunthill, etc. Thus more than a thousand feet of Lower Carboniferous\r\nstrata, and probably not less than five hundred or six hundred feet of\r\nOld Red Sandstone rocks, have been slowly carried away, grain by grain,\r\nfrom the face of the Cheviot district since the close of the Lower\r\nCarboniferous period.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these papers some reference was made to the\r\nconfiguration of the ground in the Cheviot district. We have seen\r\nthat the outlines assumed by the country have been determined in\r\nlarge measure by the nature of the rocks. Thus where igneous masses\r\nabound, the hills present a more or less irregular, and broken or lumpy\r\ncontour, while the valleys are frequently narrow and deep. In the\r\ntracts occupied by Silurian strata, we have, as a rule, broad-topped\r\nhill-masses with a smoothly-rounded outline, whose slopes generally\r\nfall away with a long gentle sweep into soft green valleys, along the\r\nbottoms of which the streams often flow in deep gullies and ravines.\r\nWhere the country is formed of sandstones, and other associated strata,\r\nthe hills are generally broad and well-rounded, but the outline is\r\nnot infrequently interrupted by lines of cliff and escarpment. These\r\nstrata, however, are confined chiefly to the low-grounds, where they\r\nform a gently-undulating country, broken here and there, as in Dunian\r\nHill, Bonchester Hill, Rubers Law, etc., by abrupt cones and knobs of\r\nigneous rock.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that the diversified character of the Cheviot\r\nHills and the adjoining low-grounds depends on the character of the\r\nrocks and also, as we shall see presently, upon geological structure.\r\nEach kind of rock has its own peculiar mode of weathering. All do\r\nnot crumble away under the action of rain, frost, and running water\r\nin precisely the same manner. Some which yield equally and uniformly\r\ngive rise to smooth outlines, others of more irregular composition,\r\nsuch as many igneous rocks, break up and crumble unequally in a\r\ncapricious and eccentric way, and these in the course of time present\r\na hummocky, lumpy, and rough irregular configuration. And as soft and\r\nreadily-weathered rocks must wear away more rapidly than indurated and\r\ndurable masses, it follows that the former will now be found most\r\nabundantly at low levels, while the latter will enter most extensively\r\ninto the composition of the hills. But the contour of a country depends\r\nnot only upon the relative durability of the rocks, but also upon the\r\nmode of their occurrence in the crust of the earth. Strata, as we\r\nhave seen, do not all lie in one way; some are horizontal, others are\r\ninclined to the horizon, while yet others are vertical. Again, many\r\nrocks are amorphous; that is to say, they occur in somewhat thick\r\nmasses which show no trace of a bedded arrangement. Such differences of\r\nstructure and arrangement influence in no small degree the weathering\r\nand denudation of rocks, and cannot be left out of account when we are\r\nseeking to discover the origin of the present configuration of our\r\nhills and valleys. Thus, escarpments and the terraced aspect of many\r\nhill-slopes are due to inequalities in the strata of which such hills\r\nare built up. The softer strata crumble away more rapidly under the\r\ntouch of the atmospheric forces than the harder beds which rest upon\r\nthem, and hence the latter are undermined, and their exposed ends or\r\ncrops, losing support, fall away and roll down the slopes. The igneous\r\nrocks of the Cheviots are arranged in beds; but so massive are these,\r\nthat frequently a hill proves to be composed from base to summit of\r\none and the same sheet of old lava. Hence there is a general absence\r\nof that terraced aspect which is so conspicuous in hills that are\r\nbuilt up of bedded rock-masses. Here and there, however, the beds are\r\nnot so massive, several cropping out upon a hill-side; and whenever\r\nthis is the case (as near Yetholm) we find the hill-slopes presenting\r\nthe usual terraced appearance--a series of cliffs and escarpments,\r\nseparated by intervening slopes, rising one above the other. In the\r\nSilurian districts no such terraces or escarpments exist, the general\r\nhigh dip of the strata, which often approaches the vertical, precluding\r\nany such contour. In a region composed of highly-inclined greywacké\r\nand shale, however, we should expect to find that where the strata are\r\nof unequal durability, the harder beds will stand up in long narrow\r\nridges, separated by intervening hollows, which have been worn out\r\nalong the outcrops of the softer and more easily-denuded beds. And such\r\nappearances do show themselves in some parts of the Silurian area. As a\r\nrule, however, the Silurian strata are not thick-bedded, and harder and\r\nsofter bands alternate so rapidly that they yield on the whole a smooth\r\nsurface under the action of the atmospheric forces. In the low-lying\r\ndistricts, which, as I have said, are mostly occupied by sandstones and\r\nshaly beds, all the abrupt isolated hills are formed of igneous rocks,\r\nwhich are much harder and tougher than the strata that surround them.\r\nIt is quite evident that these hills owe their present appearance to\r\nthe durable nature of their constituent rocks, which now project above\r\nthe general level of the surface, simply because they have been better\r\nable to resist the denuding agents than the softer rocks that once\r\ncovered and concealed them.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that each kind of rock has its own particular mode of\r\nweathering, and that the configuration of a country depends primarily\r\nupon this and upon geological structure. Indeed, so close is the\r\nconnection between the geology and the surface-outline of a country,\r\nthat to a practised observer the latter acts as an unfailing index to\r\nthe general nature of the underlying rocks, and tells him at a glance\r\nwhether these are igneous like basalt and porphyrite, aqueous like\r\nsandstone and shale, or hardened and altered strata like greywacké.\r\nBut while one cannot help noticing how in the Cheviot district the\r\ncharacter of the scenery depends largely upon the nature and structure\r\nof the rocks, he shall, nevertheless, hardly fail to observe that\r\nflowing outlines are more or less conspicuous over all the region.\r\nAnd as he descends into the main valleys, he shall be struck with the\r\nfact that the hill-slopes seem to be smoothed off in a direction that\r\ncoincides with the trend of these valleys. In short, he cannot help\r\nnoticing that the varied configuration that results from the weathering\r\nof different rock-masses has been subsequently modified by some agent\r\nwhich seems to have acted universally over the whole country. In the\r\nupper reaches of the Cheviot valleys, the rocks have evidently been\r\nrounded off by some force pressing upon them in a direction coinciding\r\nwith that of the valleys; but soon after entering upon their lower\r\nreaches, we notice that the denuding or moulding force must have turned\r\ngradually away to the north-east--the northern spurs of the Cheviots,\r\nand the low-grounds that abut upon these being smoothed off in a\r\ndirection that corresponds exactly with the trend of that great strath\r\nthrough which flow the Teviot and the Tweed, from Melrose downwards.\r\nThroughout this broad strath, which extends from the base of the\r\nLammermuirs to the foot of the Cheviots, and includes the whole of\r\nTeviotdale, the ground presents a remarkable closely-wrinkled surface,\r\nthe ridges and intervening hollows all coinciding in direction with the\r\ngeneral trend of the great strath, which is south-west and north-east;\r\nbut turning gradually round to east, as we approach the lower reaches\r\nof the Tweed.\r\n\r\nPassing round the north-eastern extremity of the Cheviot range into\r\nNorthumberland, we observe that the same series of ridges and hollows\r\ncontinues to follow an easterly direction until we near the sea-board,\r\nwhen the trend gradually swings round to the south-east, as in the\r\nneighbourhood of Belford and Bamborough, where the ridges run parallel\r\nwith the coast-line.\r\n\r\nThe ridges and hollows are most conspicuous in the low-grounds of\r\nRoxburghshire and Berwickshire, especially in the regions between\r\nKelso and Smailholm, and between Duns and Coldstream. The dwellers\r\nalong the banks of the Tweed are quite familiar with the fact that the\r\nroads which run parallel with the river are smooth and level, for they\r\ncoincide with the trend of the ridges and hollows; whilst those that\r\ncross the country at right angles to this direction must of course\r\ntraverse ridge after ridge, and are therefore exceedingly uneven. In\r\nthis low-lying district most of the ridges are composed of superficial\r\ndeposits of stony and gravelly clay and sand, and the same is the case\r\nwith those that sweep round the north-eastern spurs of the Cheviots\r\nby Coldstream and Ancroft. Some ridges, however, consist either of\r\nsolid rock alone, as near Stichill, or of rock and overlying masses\r\nof clay and stones. In the hilly regions, again, nearly all the ridges\r\nare of rock alone, especially in the districts lying between Melrose\r\nand Selkirk and between Selkirk and Hawick. Indeed, the hills drained\r\nby the upper reaches of the Teviot and its tributaries are more or\r\nless fluted and channelled, as it were--many long parallel narrow\r\nhollows having been driven out along their slopes and even frequently\r\nacross their broad tops. This scolloped and ridged aspect of the\r\nhills, however, disappears as we approach the upper reaches of the\r\nhill-valleys. From Skelfhill Pen (1745 feet) by Windburgh Hill (1662\r\nfeet), on through the ridge of the Cheviot watershed, none of the hills\r\nshows any appearance of a uniformly-wrinkled surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Rounded Rocks, with superficial deposits, _t_\r\n_t_ _t_, heaped up against steep faces. The arrows indicate direction\r\nfollowed by the smoothing agent.]\r\n\r\nA close inspection of the rock-ridges satisfies one that they have\r\nbeen smoothed off by some agent pressing upon them in a direction that\r\ncoincides with their own trend; and not only so, but the smoothing\r\nagent, it is clearly seen, must have come from the watersheds and then\r\npressed outwards to the low-grounds which are now watered by the Teviot\r\nand the Tweed. This is shown by the manner in which the rocks have\r\nbeen smoothed off, for their smooth faces look towards the dominant\r\nwatersheds, while their rough and unpolished sides point away in the\r\nopposite direction. Sometimes, however, we find that more or less\r\nsteeply projecting rocks _face_ the dominant watersheds. When such is\r\nthe case, there is usually a long sloping \"tail\" behind the crag--a\r\n\"tail\" which is composed chiefly of superficial deposits. The hills\r\nbetween Hume and Stichill afford some good examples. The two kinds of\r\nappearances are exhibited in the accompanying diagram (Figs. 10, 11.)\r\nThe appearance shown in Fig. 10 is of most common occurrence in the\r\nupland parts of the country, while \"crag and tail\" (as shown in Fig.\r\n11) is seen to greatest advantage in the open low-grounds. In both\r\ncases it will be observed that superficial deposits (_t_) nestle behind\r\na more or less steep face of rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--\"Crag and Tail\"; boss of hard rock, _c_;\r\nintersecting sandstones, _s_; superficial deposits heaped up in rear of\r\ncrag, _t_. The arrow indicates direction followed by smoothing agent.]\r\n\r\nWhen the rocks have not been much exposed to the action of the\r\nweather, they often show a polished surface covered with long parallel\r\ngrooves and striæ or scratches. Such polished and scratched surfaces\r\nare best seen when the superficial deposits have been only recently\r\nremoved. Often, too, when we tear away the thick turf that mantles the\r\nhill-slopes, we find the same phenomena. Indeed, wherever the rocks\r\nhave not been much acted upon by the weather, and thus broken up and\r\ndecomposed, we may expect to meet with more or less well-marked grooves\r\nand stride. Now the remarkable circumstance about these scratches is\r\nthis--they agree in direction with the trend of the rock-ridges and the\r\nhollows described above. Nor can we doubt that the superficial markings\r\nhave all been produced by one and the same agent. In the upper valleys\r\nof the Cheviots, the scratches coincide in direction with the valleys,\r\nwhich is, speaking generally, from south to north, but as we approach\r\nthe low-grounds they begin to turn more to the east (just, as we have\r\nseen, is the case with the ridges and hollows), until we enter England\r\nto the east of Coldstream, where the striæ point first nearly due east,\r\nbut eventually swing round to the south-east, as is well seen upon the\r\nlimestone rocks between Lowick and Belford. In Teviotdale the general\r\ntrend of the striæ is from south-west to north-east, a direction\r\nwhich continues to hold good until the lower reaches of the Tweed\r\nare approached, when, as we have just mentioned, they begin to turn\r\nmore and more to the east. Thus it becomes evident that the denuding\r\nagent, whatever it was, that gave rise to these ridges and scratched\r\nrock-surfaces must have pressed outwards from all the dominant\r\nwatersheds, and, sweeping down through the great undulating strath that\r\nlies between the Cheviots and the Lammermuirs, must have gradually\r\nturned away to the east and south as it rounded the northern spurs of\r\nthe former range, so as to pass south-east over the contiguous maritime\r\ndistricts of Northumberland.\r\n\r\nA few words now as to the character of the superficial deposits which\r\nenter so largely into the composition of the long parallel banks and\r\nridges in the low-grounds of Roxburghshire, Berwickshire, and the\r\nnorthern part of Northumberland. The most conspicuous and noteworthy\r\ndeposit is a hard tough tenacious clay, which is always more or\r\nless well-charged with blunted and sub-angular stones and boulders,\r\nscattered pell-mell through the mass. This clay is as a rule quite\r\nunstratified--it shows no lines of bedding, and although here and\r\nthere it contains irregular patches and beds of gravel and sand, yet\r\nit evidently does not owe its origin to the action of water. Its\r\ncolour in the upper part of Teviotdale and the Cheviots is generally a\r\ndrab-brown, or pale grey and sometimes yellow, while here and there,\r\nas in the upper reaches of the Jed valley, it is a dark dingy bluish\r\ngrey. In the lower parts of Teviotdale and in the Tweed district it\r\nis generally red or reddish brown. The stones in the clay have all\r\nbeen derived from the rocks of the region in which it occurs. Thus\r\nin Teviotdale we find that in the higher reaches of the dale which\r\nare Silurian the stones and boulders consist of various kinds of\r\ngreywacké, etc. In the lower reaches, however, when we pass into the\r\nRed Sandstone area, we note that the clay begins to contain fragments\r\nof red sandstone, while the clay itself takes on a reddish tinge, until\r\nwe get down to the vale of the Tweed, where not only is the clay very\r\ndecidedly red, but its sandstone boulders also are very numerous.\r\nThe same appearances present themselves in passing outwards from the\r\nCheviots. At first the clay contains only stones that have been derived\r\nfrom the upper parts of the hills, but by-and-by, as we near the\r\nlow-grounds, other kinds begin to make their appearance, so that by the\r\ntime we reach the Tweed we may obtain from the clay specimens of every\r\nkind of rock that occurs within the drainage-area of the Teviot and the\r\nlower reaches of the River Tweed.\r\n\r\nLook at the stones, and you shall observe that all the harder and\r\nfiner-grained specimens are well-smoothed and covered with striæ or\r\nscratches, the best marked of which run parallel with the longer axis\r\nof each stone and boulder. These scratches are evidently very similar\r\nto those markings that cover the surface of the underlying solid rock,\r\nand we may feel sure, therefore, that the denuding agent which smoothed\r\nand scratched the solid rocks had also something to do with the stones\r\nand boulders of the clay.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the stony clay, or _Till_, as it is called, we find here\r\nand there certain old river gravels. We know that these gravels are\r\nriver-formations, because not only do they lie at the bottom of the\r\nriver-valleys, but the stones, we can see, have been arranged by water\r\nrunning in one constant direction, and that direction is always _down_\r\nthe valley in which the gravels chance to occur. Frequently, however,\r\nthere is no trace of such underlying gravels, but the till rests\r\ndirectly upon the solid rocks.\r\n\r\nNow what do all these appearances mean? It is clear that there is no\r\nnatural agent in this country engaged in rounding and scratching the\r\nrocks, or in accumulating a stony clay like till. In alpine regions,\r\nhowever, we know that glaciers, as they slowly creep down their\r\nvalleys, grind and polish and scratch the rocks over which they pass,\r\nand that underneath the moving ice one may detect smoothed and striated\r\nstones precisely resembling those that occur in till. Frost in such\r\nalpine regions splits up the rocks of the cliffs and mountain-slopes\r\nthat overlook a glacier, and immense masses of angular stones and\r\ndébris, thus loosened, roll down and accumulate along the flanks of\r\nthe ice-streams. Eventually such accumulations are borne slowly down\r\nthe valley upon the back of the glacier, and are dropped at last over\r\nthe terminal front of the ice, where they become intermingled with the\r\nstones and rubbish, which are pushed or washed out from underneath the\r\nice. These heaps and masses of angular débris and stones are called\r\n\"moraines,\" and one can see that in Switzerland the glaciers must at\r\nsome time have been much larger, for ancient moraines occur far down\r\nin the low-grounds of that country--the glaciers being now confined\r\nto the uppermost reaches of the deep mountain-valleys. Moreover, we\r\nmay note how the mountain-slopes overlooking the present puny glaciers\r\nhave been rubbed by ice up to a height of sometimes a thousand feet and\r\nmore above the level of the existing ice-streams. Now since the aspect\r\npresented by the glaciated rock-surfaces of Switzerland is exactly\r\nparalleled by the rounded and smoothed rocks of Scotland, there can\r\nbe no doubt that the latter have had a similar origin. Again, we find\r\nthroughout the low-grounds of Switzerland a deposit of till precisely\r\nresembling that which is so well developed in Teviotdale and the valley\r\nof the Tweed. And as there can be no doubt that the Swiss till has been\r\nproduced by the action of glacier ice, we are compelled to believe the\r\nsame of the till in Scotland.\r\n\r\nLet us further note that in the deep mountain-valleys of Switzerland\r\nthe glacial deposits consist for the most part of coarse morainic\r\ndébris--of such materials, in short, as the terminal moraines of\r\nexisting glaciers are mainly composed. Not infrequently this morainic\r\ndébris has been more or less acted upon by the rivers that escape from\r\nthe glaciers, and the angular stones have been rounded and arranged in\r\nbedded masses. It is only when we get out of the mountain-valleys and\r\napproach the low-grounds that the till, or stony clay, begins to appear\r\nabundantly. The same phenomena characterise the Cheviot district. In\r\nthe upper reaches of the mountain-valleys at the heads of the Teviot,\r\nthe Kale, the Bowmont, etc., either till does not occur or it is thin\r\nand often concealed below masses of rude morainic débris and gravel.\r\nOut in the low-grounds, however, till, as we have already remarked, is\r\nthe most conspicuous of all the superficial deposits. From these facts\r\nit may be inferred that till indicates the former presence of great\r\nconfluent glaciers, while morainic débris in hill-valleys points to the\r\naction of comparatively small local and isolated glaciers.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the general conclusions which may be derived from a\r\nstudy of the rock-ridges, flutings, and striæ, and the till of the\r\nCheviot district? Clearly this: that the whole country has at one time\r\nbeen deeply buried under glacier ice. The evidence shows us that the\r\nbroad strath stretching between the Lammermuirs and the Cheviots must\r\nhave been filled to overflowing with a great mass of ice that descended\r\nfrom the uplands of Peebles and Selkirk and the broad-topped heights\r\nthat overlook the sources of the Teviot. The Cheviots appear to have\r\nbeen quite buried underneath this wide sea of ice, and so likewise\r\nwere the Lammermuirs. At the same time, as we know, all Scotland was\r\nsimilarly enveloped in a vast sheet of snow and ice, which streamed out\r\nfrom the main watersheds of the country, and followed the lines of the\r\nchief straths--that is to say, the general slope of the ground. The\r\ntrack of the ice in the Cheviot district is very distinctly marked. In\r\nTeviotdale it followed the trend of the valley, and, grinding along\r\nthe outcrop of the Silurian strata, deepened old hollows and scooped\r\nout new ones in the soft shaly beds, while the intervening harder\r\nstrata, which offered greater resistance to the denuding action of\r\nthe ice, did not wear so easily, and so were rounded off, and formed\r\na series of ridges running parallel to the eroded hollows. The stones\r\nand rubbish, dragged along underneath the ice, necessarily increased\r\nas the glacier mass crept on its way. The rocks were scratched and\r\ngrooved by the stones that were forced over them, and the polishing\r\nwas completed by the finer sand and clay which resulted from the\r\ngrinding process. Wherever a rock projected there would be a tendency\r\nfor the stones and clay and sand to gather behind it. One may notice\r\nthe same kind of action upon the bed of a stream, where the sediment\r\ntends to collect in the rear of prominent stones and boulders. And we\r\ncan hardly fail to have observed further that the sediment of a river\r\noften arranges itself under the action of the current in long banks,\r\nwhich run parallel to the course of the water. Underneath the ice-sheet\r\nthe stones, sand, and clay behaved in the same way. Behind projecting\r\nrocks in sheltered nooks and hollows, they accumulated, while in\r\nplaces exposed to the full sweep of the ice-stream they were piled up\r\nand drawn out into long parallel banks and ridges, the trend of which\r\ncoincided with that of the ice-flow. The presence of confused and\r\nirregular patches and lenticular beds of sand, clay, and gravel in the\r\ntill is not difficult to understand when we know that there is always\r\nmore or less water flowing on underneath a glacier. Such streams must\r\nassort the débris, and roll angular fragments into rounded stones and\r\npebbles; but the materials thus assorted in layers will ever and anon\r\nbe crushed up so as to be either partially or wholly obliterated by the\r\nslowly moving glacier.\r\n\r\nAs the stones and clay were derived from the underlying rocks, it is no\r\nwonder that the colour of the till should vary. In the Silurian tracts\r\nit is pale yellowish, or bluish grey, and the stones consist chiefly\r\nof fragments of Silurian rocks, all blunted and smoothed, and often\r\nbeautifully polished and striated. When we get into the Red Sandstone\r\nregion of the low-grounds the colour of the clay begins by-and-by to\r\nchange, and fragments of red sandstone become commingled with the\r\nSilurian stones, until ere long the colour of the deposit is decidedly\r\nred, and sandstone fragments abound. Everywhere the stones show that\r\nthey have been carried persistently in one direction, and that is _out\r\nfrom the watershed, and down the main valleys_.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the ice-marks upon the solid rocks, and the trend of\r\nthe \"drums,\" as the parallel ridges of till are termed, show that the\r\nice-sheet of Teviotdale and Tweed gradually turned away to the east and\r\nsouth-east as it swept round the north-eastern spurs of the Cheviots.\r\nNow we may well ask why the ice did not go right out into the North\r\nSea, which is apparently the course it ought to have followed. The\r\nsame curious deflection affected the great ice-stream that occupied\r\nthe basin of the Forth. When it got past North Berwick, that stream,\r\ninstead of flowing directly east into the North Sea, turned away to\r\nthe south-east and overflowed the northern spurs of the Lammermuirs,\r\nbringing with it into the valley of the Tweed stones and boulders which\r\nhad travelled all the way from the Highlands. It is obvious there\r\nmust have been some impediment to the flow of the Scottish ice into\r\nthe basin of the North Sea. What could have blocked its passage in\r\nthat direction? At the very time that Scotland lay concealed beneath\r\nits ice-sheet, Norway and Sweden were likewise smothered in ice which\r\nattained a thickness of not less than five or six thousand feet.\r\nThe whole basin of the Baltic was occupied by a vast glacier which\r\nflowed south into Northern Germany, and this sheet was continuous with\r\nglacier-ice that crossed over Denmark. When we consider how shallow\r\nthe North Sea is (it does not average more than forty fathoms between\r\nScotland and the Continent), we cannot doubt that the immense masses\r\nof ice descending from Norway could not possibly have floated off,\r\nbut must actually have crept across the bottom of that sea until they\r\nabutted upon and coalesced with the Scottish ice, so as to form one\r\nvast _mer de glace_.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the Scandinavian ice blocked up the path of the\r\nScottish glaciers into the basin of the North Sea, and compelled them\r\nto flow south-east into England.[H] Had there been no such obstruction\r\nto the passage of the Scottish glaciers, it is impossible to believe\r\nthat snow and ice could ever have accumulated to such a depth in\r\nScotland. The Scottish ice reached a thickness of some three thousand\r\nfeet in its deeper parts. It is evident, however, that had there been\r\na free course for the glaciers, they would have moved off before they\r\ncould have attained this thickness. And we can hardly doubt, therefore,\r\nthat it was the damming-up of their outlet by the great Scandinavian\r\nice-sheet that enabled them to deepen to such an extent in the valleys\r\nand low-grounds of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[H] In the extreme north of Scotland we find that the Scottish ice was,\r\nin like manner, compelled to turn aside and overflow Caithness from\r\nsouth-east to north-west.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice-sheet was at its thickest, the Cheviots were completely\r\ncovered, nevertheless they served to divide the ice-flow between\r\nScotland and England, although here and there one finds that the ice\r\npassed over some of the lower summits, carrying with it boulders and\r\nstones. This is by no means an uncommon circumstance in Scotland and\r\nother glaciated countries. Thus we note that Highland boulders have\r\nbeen brought into the vale of the Tweed across the Lammermuirs; and in\r\nthe same way boulders from the heights overlooking Eskdale have been\r\ncarried over some of the lower hill-tops into the vale of the Teviot.\r\nIn like manner the Swedish ice occasionally overflowed the lower\r\nmountain-tops of the dividing ridge or watershed into Norway.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder now that the Cheviot area should exhibit so many flowing\r\noutlines, that the hills should be so smoothed and rounded and fluted,\r\nthat the low-grounds should be cumbered with such heaps of clay and\r\nstriated stones? Long before the great glaciers appeared, the rocks\r\nwere weathered and worn by the action of the usual atmospheric forces,\r\nand each had assumed its own peculiar outline; but how greatly has\r\nthis been modified by the grinding action of the ice-sheet! To what\r\nan extent have projecting rocks been rubbed, and how great is the\r\ndestruction that has befallen the loose accumulations of river gravel,\r\nsand, and clay that gathered in the valleys before the advent of the\r\nIce Age! All that now remains of these are a few patches preserved here\r\nand their underneath the till. The Cheviots can tell us nothing of the\r\nkinds of plants and animals that clothed and peopled the country in\r\npre-glacial times. All we learn is that streams and rivers flowed as\r\nthey flow now, and that by-and-by everything was changed, and the land\r\ndisappeared underneath a vast covering of snow and ice.\r\n\r\nIn my concluding paper I will show how this ice period passed away, and\r\nhow the present condition of things succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nI have described the condition of the Cheviot district during the\r\nclimax of the Ice Age as one of intense arctic cold, the whole ridge of\r\nhills being then completely smothered in snow and ice. This excessive\r\nclimate, however, did not last continuously throughout the so-called\r\nglacial period, but was interrupted by more than one mild interglacial\r\nepoch. We have evidence in Scotland, as in other countries, to show\r\nthat the great confluent ice-masses melted away so as to uncover all\r\nthe low-grounds and permit the reappearance of plants and animals.\r\nRivers again watered the land, and numerous lakes diversified the face\r\nof the country. Willows, hazels, and alders grew in the sheltered\r\nvalleys, oak-trees flourished in the low-grounds, and Scots firs\r\nclustered upon the hill-slopes. A strong, grassy vegetation covered\r\nwide areas, and sedges and rushes luxuriated in marshy places and\r\nencroached upon the margins of the lakes. The mammoth, or woolly-coated\r\nelephant, roamed over the land, and among its congeners were the\r\nextinct ox, the horse, the Irish elk, and the reindeer. After such a\r\ntemperate condition of things had continued for some time--perhaps\r\nfor thousands of years--the land, during the last interglacial epoch,\r\nbecame gradually submerged to a depth of several hundred feet, and a\r\ncold, ungenial sea, in which flourished species of northern and arctic\r\nshells, covered the low-grounds of Scotland. The cold continuing to\r\nincrease, our glaciers descended for the last time from the mountains\r\nand encroached upon the bed of the sea, until they became confluent,\r\nfairly usurping the floor of the German Ocean, and pushing back the\r\nwestern seas as far as, and even beyond, the islands of the Outer\r\nHebrides. There is good reason to believe that such great changes of\r\nclimate occurred several times during the glacial period, which thus\r\nseems to have consisted of an alternation of cold and genial epochs.\r\nBut as the last phase in this extraordinary series of changes was a\r\ncold one, during which great glaciers scoured the face of the country,\r\nwe now obtain only a few scattered traces of the genial conditions\r\nthat characterised the preceding mild interglacial epochs. Vegetable\r\naccumulations, lake and river deposits with mammalian remains, marine\r\nbeds and their shelly contents, were all ploughed up by the ice, and to\r\na very large extent demolished. Here and there, however, we find in the\r\ntill or boulder-clay that marks the last cold epoch, wasted fragments\r\nof trees, tusks of mammoths, and broken sea-shells; while underneath\r\nthe till we occasionally come upon old lake deposits with vegetable and\r\nmammalian remains, or, as the case may be, beds of marine origin well\r\nstocked with sea-shells of arctic species. And these freshwater and\r\nmarine beds repose, in many cases, upon an older accumulation of till,\r\nwhich belongs to an earlier cold epoch of the glacial period. In the\r\nCheviot district proper, the traces of mild, interglacial conditions\r\nare very slight, but in the immediate neighbourhood we find them more\r\nstrongly marked. Thus, in the valley of the Slitrig, near Hawick, we\r\nnotice freshwater beds with peaty matter lying between a lower and\r\nan upper till or boulder-clay; and interglacial freshwater beds also\r\nappear in the neighbouring county of Peebles, particularly in the\r\nvalley of the Leithan Water. Again, in the valley of the Tweed near\r\nCarham, there occur interglacial beds in which I detected numerous\r\nbones of water-rats and frogs. These interglacial remains acquire a\r\npeculiar interest when we come to view the \"superficial deposits\" of\r\nScotland in connection with those of England and the Continent; for,\r\nas I have endeavoured to show elsewhere,[I] it is most likely that the\r\nancient gravels of England, which contain the earliest traces of man,\r\nbelong for the most part to interglacial times; and the extraordinary\r\nchanges of climate described above may therefore have been actually\r\nwitnessed by human eyes. Indeed, I believe it was the advent of the\r\nlast cold epoch of the Ice Age that drove out the old tribes who used\r\nthe rude flint implements that are now found in the gravel deposits\r\nand caves of England, and who occupied the British area along with\r\nhippopotami, rhinoceroses, elephants, lions, hyænas, and other animals.\r\nThe men who entered Britain after the final disappearance of arctic\r\nconditions, were more advanced in civilisation, and were accompanied by\r\na very different assemblage of animals--by a group represented by oxen,\r\nsheep, dogs, and other creatures, most of which are still indigenous to\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n[I] _Great Ice Age._\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Cheviots. When the final cold epoch had reached\r\nits climax, and the ice-sheet began to melt away for the last time,\r\nthe tops of the hills then once more became uncovered, and large\r\nblocks, detached by the action of the frost, fell upon the surface of\r\nthe glaciers, and were borne down the valleys, some of them to become\r\nstranded here and there on hill-slopes, others to be carried far away\r\nfrom the Cheviot area and dropped at last over Northumberland and\r\nDurham, or even further south. As the melting of the ice continued, and\r\nthe glacier of the Tweed ceased to reach the sea, great accumulations\r\nof gravel and sand were formed. Underneath the ice, sub-glacial streams\r\nploughed out the till, and paved their hidden courses with gravel\r\nand sand. In summer-time, the whole surface of the Tweed glacier was\r\nabundantly washed with water, which, pouring down by clefts and holes\r\nin the ice, swelled all the sub-glacial streams and rivers. At the\r\nsame time, floods descending from the Lammermuirs and the Cheviots,\r\npushed with them vast quantities of shingle, gravel, and sand, part of\r\nwhich was swept upon the surface of the Tweed glacier, while much seems\r\nto have gathered along its flanks, forming banks and ridges running\r\nparallel with the course of the valley.\r\n\r\nAt last the time came when the ice had fairly vanished from the lower\r\nreaches of the Tweed, and we now walk over its bed and mark the\r\nlong ridges and banks of shingle and gravel that were formed by the\r\nsub-glacial streams and rivers, and the somewhat similar accumulations\r\nthat gathered along the sides of the glacier at the foot of the\r\nLammermuir Hills. Here and there, also, we note the heaps (_i.e._\r\nmoraines) of shingle, earth, clay, and débris, with large erratics\r\nwhich travelled on the surface of the ice, and were dropped upon the\r\nground as that ice melted away. All the loose erratics that lie at\r\nthe surface in the lower reaches of the Tweed valley have come from\r\nthe west. Some of them rest upon hard rock, others upon till, and yet\r\nothers crown the tops and slopes of gravel and sand hillocks, or appear\r\nin low mounds of morainic origin.\r\n\r\nIn the valleys of the Cheviot Hills one traces the footsteps of the\r\nretiring glaciers in mounds and hummocks of rude earthy débris, blocks,\r\nand rock-rubbish. These are terminal moraines, and they indicate\r\ncertain pauses in the recession of the ice. The most remarkable\r\nexamples occur in the valley of the Kale Water at Blinkbonny, a\r\nmile or so above the village of Eckford. At that place a bank of\r\nmorainic matter at one time blocked up the valley of the Kale, and\r\nthus formed a wide and extensive lake that stretched up to and beyond\r\nMorebattle. Numerous curious hillocks of gravel and sand are banked\r\nagainst the moraine, and point to the action of the flood-waters\r\nthat escaped from the melting glacier. Other gravelly moraine mounds\r\noccur higher up the same valley, as near Grubbit Mill. These last\r\ntell us of a time when the Kale glacier had retreated still further,\r\nso as to have its terminal front near where Morebattle now is.\r\nWreaths and hummocks of gravel and sand, extending from Grubbit to\r\nthe north-east, along the hollow in the hills that leads to Yetholm\r\nLoch, indicate the course taken by a portion of the torrents that\r\nescaped from the ice in summer-time. In other hill-valleys, similar\r\nindications of ancient local glaciers may be seen. Some of the most\r\nconspicuous of these appear upon the slopes and in the high valleys\r\nwithin the drainage-areas of the Jed and the Kale. They consist\r\nchiefly of mounds and hillocks, made up of coarse earthy débris and\r\nrock-rubbish; sometimes these are solitary and rest in the throat of\r\na valley, at other times they are scattered all over the hill-slopes\r\nand valley-bottom. One can have no doubt as to what they mean: they\r\nindicate clearly the presence of insignificant glaciers that were\r\nsoon to vanish away. The larger and better-defined mounds are true\r\nterminal moraines, while the scattered heaps of rubbish point out\r\nfor us the beds in which the glaciers lay. Thus, from the sea-coast\r\nup to the highest ridge of this border country, we follow the spoor\r\nof the melting ice; passing from massive and wide-spread deposits of\r\ntill, gravel, and sand, and angular débris in the low-grounds, up\r\nto insignificant heaps and scatterings of rock-rubbish and angular\r\nboulders at the higher levels of the country.\r\n\r\nSeveral more or less extensive flats in the hill-valleys indicate the\r\nformer presence of lakes which have become obliterated by the action of\r\nthe streams. But by far the most conspicuous example of such silted-up\r\nlakes is that of the Kale valley, to which reference has already\r\nbeen made. In the later stages of the Ice Age that river-valley must\r\nhave existed as a lake from Marlfield up to and beyond Morebattle.\r\nIndeed, there is evidence to show that even within historical times a\r\nconsiderable lake overspread the flat grounds in this neighbourhood.\r\nThe name _Morebattle_ is supposed to mean the \"village by the lake,\"\r\nand, up to a few years ago, there was a sheet of water called Linton\r\nLoch a little to the east of Morebattle. But this has been drained by\r\nthe proprietor, and is now represented by only two insignificant pools.\r\nThe present course of the Kale between Marlfield and Kalemouth is of\r\npost-glacial age--the old pre-glacial and interglacial course being\r\nfilled up with drifted materials. As the appearances at this place are\r\nsomewhat typical of many of the valleys of the Cheviot district, I may\r\nbriefly summarise the history of the Morebattle lake.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of the last great age of ice the Kale would seem\r\nto have flowed from Marlfield, close to the line now followed by the\r\nturnpike road as far as Easter Wooden, after which it passed near the\r\npresent sites of Blinkbonny and Mosstower, and so on to the Teviot,\r\nwhich it joined some little distance above Kalemouth. During the Ice\r\nAge many of the old river-courses were completely choked up with clay,\r\nstones, and gravel, so that when the ice melted away the rivers did\r\nnot always or even often regain their old channels. Thus, in the\r\ncase of the Kale, we find that the present course of the river below\r\nMarlfield is of recent or post-glacial age, having been excavated by\r\nthe river since the close of the glacial epoch. The old or pre-glacial\r\ncourse lies completely choked up and concealed under the rubbish shot\r\ninto it at a time when glacier-ice filled all the valley of the Kale\r\ndown to Marlfield. At this latter place the Kale glacier seems to have\r\nmade a considerable pause--it ceased for some time to retreat--and\r\nthus a heavy bank of gravel, sand, shingle, earth, blocks, and angular\r\nrubbish gathered in front of it, and obliterated the old river-course\r\ninto which they were dropped. When the glacier at last disappeared, a\r\nlake was formed above the morainic dam that closed the valley below\r\nMarlfield, and the outflow of the lake took place at a point lying\r\nsome little distance to the north of the old or pre-glacial course of\r\nthe Kale. By slow degrees the river excavated a new channel for itself\r\nin the Old Red Sandstone rocks, and in doing so gradually lowered the\r\nlevel of the waters. This and the silting action of the Kale and its\r\nfeeders slowly converted the lake-hollow into a broad alluvial flat\r\nthrough which the river now winds its way.\r\n\r\nAnother extensive lake seems to have occupied the vale of the Teviot\r\nbetween Jedfoot and Eckford, and similar old lake-beds occur in several\r\nof the hill-valleys. One good example is seen in the valley of the\r\nOxnam Water, where the flat tract that extends from the old village of\r\nOxnam up to the foot of the Row Hill indicates the former presence of\r\na lake which has been drained by the stream cutting for itself a gorge\r\nin Silurian greywackés and shales. In many other valleys it is easy to\r\nsee that the streams do not always occupy their pre-glacial courses,\r\nand some of the old forsaken courses are still patent enough. Thus,\r\na glance at the hollow that extends from Mossburnford on the Jed to\r\nHardenpeel on the Oxnam is enough to convince one that in pre-glacial,\r\nand probably in early post-glacial times also, a considerable stream\r\nhas flowed from what is now the vale of the Jed into the valley of the\r\nOxnam.\r\n\r\nIn all the valleys we meet with striking evidence to show that the\r\nstreams and rivers must formerly have been larger than they are\r\nnow. Certain banks and ridges of gravel fringe the valley-slopes at\r\nconsiderable heights, and indicate the action of deeper and broader\r\ncurrents than now make their way towards the sea. It is probable that\r\nthese high-level gravel terraces date their existence back to the close\r\nof the Ice Age, when local glaciers still lingered in some of the\r\nmountain-valleys, and when in summer-time great floods and torrents\r\ndescended from the hills.\r\n\r\nAn extremely humid climate seems to have characterised Scotland even\r\nin post-glacial times, as may be gathered from the phenomena of her\r\npeat-mosses. Very little peat occurs on the Scottish side of the\r\nCheviots, and it is conspicuous chiefly on the very crest of the hills,\r\nwhere it attains a thickness that varies from a foot or two up to five\r\nor six yards. Here and there we detect the remains of birch under the\r\npeat, but the peat itself is composed chiefly of bog-moss and heather.\r\nThe evidence so abundantly supplied by the peat-mosses in other parts\r\nof Scotland shows that after the Ice Age had passed away the Scottish\r\narea became clothed with luxuriant forests of oak, pine, and other\r\ntrees. At that time the British Islands appear to have been joined to\r\nthemselves and the Continent across the upraised beds of the Irish Sea\r\nand the German Ocean. Races of men who used polished stone implements\r\nand sailed in canoes that were hollowed out of single oaks inhabited\r\nthe country, together with certain species of oxen (now either extinct\r\nor domesticated), the elk, the beaver, the wolf, and other animals,\r\nsuch as the dog and the sheep, which are still indigenous. The climate\r\nwas more excessive then than it is now--the summers being warmer and\r\nthe winters colder. By-and-by, however, submergence ensued, the great\r\nwooded plain that seems once to have extended between Britain and the\r\nContinent disappeared below the waves, and the climate of this country\r\nbecame more humid. The old forests began to decay and the peat-mosses\r\nto increase, until by-and-by large areas in the low-grounds passed\r\ninto the condition of dreary moor and morass, and even the brushwood\r\nand stunted trees of the hills died down and became enveloped in a\r\nmantle of bog-moss. A study of the present condition of the Scottish\r\npeat-mosses leads one to believe that the rate of increase is now much\r\nexceeded by the rate of decay, and that the eventual disappearance of\r\nthe peat that clothes hill-tops and valley-bottoms is only a question\r\nof time. Draining and other agricultural operations have no doubt\r\ninfluenced to some extent this general decay of the peat-mosses; but\r\nthere is reason to suspect that the change of climate, to which the\r\ndecay of the peat is due, may really be owing to some cosmical cause.\r\nQuite recently an accomplished Norwegian botanist has come to similar\r\nconclusions regarding the peat-mosses of the Scandinavian peninsula.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the geological history of the Cheviot district\r\ndown to the \"Recent Period.\" From this point the story of the past\r\nmust be continued by the archæologist, and into his province I will\r\nnot trespass further than to indicate some of the more remarkable\r\ntraces which the early human occupants of the upland valleys left\r\nbehind them. Before doing so, however, I may briefly recapitulate the\r\ngeneral results we have obtained from our rapid review of the glacial\r\nand post-glacial deposits. A study of these has taught us that the\r\nCheviot Hills and the adjoining low-grounds participated in those\r\narctic conditions under the influence of which all Scotland and a\r\nlarge portion of England were buried beneath a wide-spread _mer de\r\nglace_. The Cheviots themselves were completely smothered under a mass\r\nof glacier-ice which extended across the vale of the Tweed, and was\r\ncontinuous over the Lammermuirs with the vast sheet that filled all the\r\ngreat lowlands of central Scotland. But although the Cheviots were thus\r\noverwhelmed, they yet served to divide the ice-flow, for we find that\r\nthe gelid masses moved outwards from the hills towards the valley of\r\nthe Tweed, turning gradually away to east and south-east to creep over\r\nthe north part of England. How far south the ice-sheet reached has not\r\nyet been determined, but its _moraine profonde_ or till may be traced\r\nto the edge of the Thames valley; and I have picked up in Norfolk\r\nice-worn fragments of igneous rock, which have been derived from\r\nthe Cheviots themselves, showing that Scottish ice actually invaded\r\nthe low-grounds south of the Wash. Such severe glacial conditions,\r\nafter continuing for a long time, were interrupted more than once by\r\nintervening periods characterised by a milder and more genial climate.\r\nThe great _mer de glace_ then melted out of the valleys, and for\r\naught that we can say the snow and ice may even have vanished from\r\nthe hills themselves. Vegetation now covered the country, and herds\r\nof the mammoth, the old extinct ox, the Irish elk, the reindeer, the\r\nhorse, and probably other creatures, roamed over the now deserted\r\nbeds of the glaciers. It was probably at this time that Palæolithic\r\nman lived in Britain. He was contemporaneous with lions, elephants,\r\nrhinoceroses, hippopotami, mammoths, reindeer, and other animals of\r\nsouthern and northern habitats, the former living in England when the\r\nclimate was genial, but being replaced by the northern species when\r\nthe temperature began again to fall, and snow and glaciers once more\r\nreappeared and crept downwards and outwards from the hills. Towards\r\nthe close of the interglacial period the land became submerged to a\r\nconsiderable extent, and species of arctic shells lived over the sites\r\nof the drowned land where the mammoth and its congeners had flourished.\r\nBy-and-by the cold so far increased that another great ice-sheet filled\r\nup the shallow sea, and as it slowly ground over the face of the land\r\nand the sea-bottom, it scoured out and demolished to a large extent all\r\nloose fluviatile, lacustrine, and marine accumulations. When at last\r\nthe ice melted away, it left the ground cumbered with stony clay, and\r\nwith much gravel and sand and morainic débris. It is underneath these\r\ndeposits that we yet obtain now and again fragments of the life of that\r\ninterglacial epoch. But in all the regions visited by the last great\r\nincursion of the _mer de glace_, such relics are comparatively rare; it\r\nis only when we get beyond the districts that were overwhelmed that the\r\nancient interglacial remains are well preserved. Beyond the southern\r\nextremity reached by the latest general ice-sheet--that is to say, in\r\nthe regions south of the Humber, we find the country often sprinkled\r\nwith tumultuous heaps and wide-spread sheets of gravel and brick-earth,\r\nwhich seem to owe their origin to the floods and torrents that escaped\r\nfrom the melting ice. These waters, sweeping over the land, carried\r\nalong with them such relics of man and beast as lay at the surface,\r\nwashing away interglacial river-deposits, and scattering the materials\r\nfar and wide over the undulating low-grounds of central and eastern\r\nEngland. Mr. S. B. J. Skertchly, of the Geological Survey of England,\r\nhas shown that such is the origin of the so-called \"river-gravels\"\r\nwith ancient flint implements and mammalian remains in the districts\r\nwatered by the Little Ouse, the Waveney, and other rivers in that part\r\nof England. These gravels could not possibly have been deposited by\r\nthe present rivers, for they are found capping the hills at a height\r\nof more than eighty feet above the sources of the streams. The whole\r\naspect of the gravels, indeed, betokens the action of rapid floods and\r\ntorrents, such as must have been discharged abundantly in summer-time\r\nfrom the melting ice-sheet that lay at no great distance to the north.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice-sheet vanished away, it left the ground covered thickly\r\nin many places with its various deposits. Rivers and streams were thus\r\noften debarred from their old channels, and were forced to cut out for\r\nthemselves new courses, partly in drifted materials, and partly in\r\nsolid rock. A number of lakes then existed which have since been silted\r\nup. So long as glaciers lingered in the hill-valleys, the rivers seem\r\nto have flowed in greater volume than they now do. By-and-by the bare\r\nand treeless country became clothed with a luxuriant forest-growth,\r\nand was tenanted by animals, many of which are still indigenous to\r\nour country, while others have become locally extinct, such as wolf,\r\nbeaver, and wild boar. In certain of the old lake-beds of the Cheviot\r\ndistrict numerous remains of red-deer and other animals have been\r\nturned out in the search for marl, and in land drainage and reclamation\r\noperations--the red-deer antlers being sometimes of noble dimensions.\r\nIt seems probable that in early post-glacial times our country was\r\njoined to the Continent and shared in a continental climate, the\r\nsummers being then warmer and the winters colder than now.\r\n\r\nThe men who lived in Britain after the final disappearance of the great\r\nglaciers used stone implements, which were often polished and highly\r\nfinished, and they sailed in canoes, being probably a race of active\r\nhunters and fishers. They belong to the archæologist's \"Neolithic\" or\r\nnew-stone period--the \"Palæolithic\" or old-stone period being of much\r\nolder date, and separated, as I believe, from Neolithic times by the\r\nintervention of the last cold epoch of the Ice Age.\r\n\r\nTo the forest epoch succeeded a time when the climate became very\r\nhumid, a result which may have been due in large part to the separation\r\nof Britain from the Continent. It was then that the ancient forests\r\nbegan to decay, and peat-mosses to increase. How long such humid\r\nconditions of climate characterised the country we can hardly say, but\r\nwe know that nowadays our peat-mosses do not grow so rapidly as they\r\nonce did, and indeed almost everywhere the rate of decay is greater\r\nthan the rate of increase. This points to a further change of climate,\r\nand brings us at once face to face with the present.\r\n\r\nAnd now a few words, in conclusion, as to the old camps and other\r\nremains that occur so abundantly in the valleys of the Cheviot Hills.\r\nIn many of the hill-valleys, especially towards their upper reaches,\r\nas in the valleys of the Kale and the Bowmont, almost every hill is\r\nmarked by the presence of one or more circular or oval camps or forts.\r\nThey are generally placed in the most defensible positions, on the very\r\ntops of the hills or on projecting spurs and ridges. Most of them are\r\nof inconsiderable dimensions, and could not have afforded protection\r\nto any large number of men, for many hardly exceed one hundred feet in\r\ndiameter. Not a few consist of only a single circular or oval rampart\r\nwith an external ditch--the rampart being composed of the rude débris\r\nwhich was dug out to form the ditch. Others, however, are not only\r\nmuch larger (five to six hundred feet in diameter), but surrounded, in\r\nwhole or in part, with two or more ramparts separated by intervening\r\nditches; and I have noticed that as a rule the side which must have\r\nbeen most easily assailable was protected by several ramparts rising\r\none above the other. From the extraordinary number of these hill-forts\r\none has the impression that the upper valleys of the Cheviots must\r\nat one time have been thickly peopled, probably in pre-Roman times.\r\nIt is easy to see that the camps or forts overlooking a valley often\r\nbear a certain relation to each other, as if the one had been raised\r\nto support the other, and not infrequently we can trace well-marked\r\nintrenchments extending across a hill-ridge, or along a hill-slope\r\nfor a distance of not much short of a mile, and evidently having some\r\nstrategic connection with the forts or camps in their vicinity. I found\r\nno trace of any \"dwellings,\" either near the forts or in the vicinity\r\nof the terraces. The only indications of what may have been the walls\r\nof such appear within a fortified camp, called the Moat Hill, at\r\nBuchtrig. This is an isolated knoll of rock, which has been strongly\r\nfortified--large slabs and blocks of the porphyrite of which it is\r\ncomposed having been wedged out with infinite pains to form circular\r\nramparts. The \"walls\" are of course nearly level with the ground and\r\ngrassed over, but they indicate little square enclosures, which may\r\nvery possibly have been huts closely huddled together. This fort is\r\noval, and measures five hundred feet by two hundred and seventy.\r\n\r\nIn the same neighbourhood we also meet with plentiful marks of ancient\r\ncultivation and with places of sepulture--all of which may without\r\nmuch doubt be referred to the same period as the camps and forts. The\r\nslopes of the hills are often marked with broad horizontal terraces,\r\nthat remind one strongly of the \"lazy-beds\" of the Hebrides. They are\r\nevidently the \"cultivated grounds\" of the hill-men, and doubtless the\r\nhill-slopes were selected for various reasons, chief among which would\r\nbe their retired and somewhat inaccessible position. The ease with\r\nwhich they could be drained and irrigated would be another of their\r\nrecommendations; and we must bear in mind that at this early date the\r\nlow-grounds were covered with forests and morasses, and therefore not\r\nso easily cultivated as the hill-slopes.\r\n\r\nHere and there we notice also little conical hillocks or tumuli. They\r\nwere formerly much more numerous, and by-and-by they will doubtless\r\nall disappear. Numbers, even within recent years, have been pulled\r\ndown, partly to clear the ground, and partly for the sake of the stones\r\nof which they are composed. This is much to be regretted; for their\r\ndestruction simply means the obliteration of historical records, the\r\nloss of which can never be made good. I asked a farmer what had become\r\nof the tumuli which at one time, according to the Ordnance Survey\r\nmap, were dotted over the hill behind his house. \"If it's the wee\r\nknowes (knolls) you mean, I pu'd them down, for they were jist in the\r\nway. There was naething o' importance below the stanes, only a wheen\r\nworthless bits o' pottery!\" And the worthy pointed to a heap of stones\r\nbehind a neighbouring \"dyke,\" where I afterwards found some fragments\r\nof the pottery which had been so ruthlessly demolished. These tumuli\r\nare no doubt old burial-places, and much information concerning the\r\nhabits of our ancient predecessors might often be obtained by a careful\r\nexamination of the mounds, when it is deemed essential to remove them.\r\nBut, surely, after all, they might be spared, for they can seldom be so\r\nvery much \"in the way\"; and, at all events, if they must be removed,\r\nmight it not be well to communicate the fact of their approaching\r\ndemolition to some local archæological society, or to any member of the\r\nBerwickshire Naturalists' Club, who for the sake of science would, I\r\nfeel certain, do what was possible to preserve an accurate account of\r\ntheir contents?\r\n\r\n\"Standing-stones\" are met with now and again, either singly or in\r\ngroups, and sometimes they form circles. It is most likely that they\r\nwere raised by the same people who made the forts and tilled the\r\nhorizontal \"lazy-beds.\" One can only conjecture that they may have\r\nbeen designed as memorial stones, to mark the place where a chief\r\nor person of consequence was slain in battle. They may also mark\r\nburial-places, or indicate the site of some deed of prowess or other\r\naction or circumstance worthy of being remembered. Antiquarians at one\r\ntime considered that all these stones were relics of druidical worship;\r\nbut it is needless to say that this view has long been abandoned.\r\nThat the ancient inhabitants of the Cheviots may have had some kind\r\nof religion is exceedingly probable, but it must have been of a very\r\nprimitive kind, not more advanced than that of the North American\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the more notable relics of the people who lived in the\r\nvalleys of the Cheviot Hills in pre-Roman times. These valleys, as I\r\nhave said, seem to have supported a numerous population, who tilled the\r\nslopes and probably hunted in the forests of the adjoining low-grounds.\r\nThat they lived in fear of foes is sufficiently evident from the number\r\nof their intrenchments and fortified camps, to which they would betake\r\nthemselves whenever their enemies appeared.\r\n\r\nWhat effect the Roman occupation had on the dwellers among these hills\r\nwe cannot tell. The great \"Watling Street\" passes across the Cheviots,\r\nand there are some old circular forts and camps quite close to that\r\nwonderful road, along which many a battalion of Roman soldiers must\r\nhave marched; and these forts, if of pre-Roman age, were not at all\r\nlikely to have been held by the natives after Watling Street was made.\r\nIn the remoter fastnesses of the hills, however, the old tribes may\r\nhave continued to crop their \"lazy-beds,\" to hunt, and tend their\r\nherds, during the Roman occupation, and the old forts may have been in\r\nrequisition long after the last Roman had disappeared over the borders.\r\n\r\nBut I have already, I fear, delayed too long over the old history of\r\nthe Cheviot Hills, and must now draw my meagre sketches to a close.\r\nIn my first paper I said that these hills were a _terra incognita_ to\r\nthe tourist. Those who visit the district must not therefore expect\r\nto meet with hotel accommodation. But \"knowing\" pedestrians will not\r\nbe much disturbed with this information, and will probably find, after\r\nthey have concluded their wanderings, that the hospitality and general\r\nheartiness for which our stalwart Borderers were famous in other days\r\nare still as noteworthy characteristics as they used to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe Long Island, or Outer Hebrides.[J]\r\n\r\n[J] _Good Words_, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThat long range of islands and islets which, extending from latitude\r\n56° 47' N. to latitude 58° 32' N., acts as a great natural breakwater\r\nto protect the north-west coast of Scotland from the rude assaults\r\nof the Atlantic billows is not much visited by the ordinary tourist.\r\nDuring \"the season\" the steamers now and again, it is true, deposit a\r\nfew wanderers at Tarbert and Stornoway, some of whom may linger for a\r\nshorter or longer time to try a cast for salmon in Loch Laxdail, while\r\nothers, on similar piscatorial deeds intent, may venture inland as far\r\nas Gearaidh nah Aimhne (Garrynahine). Others, again, who are curious\r\nin the matter of antiquities, may visit the weird standing-stones of\r\nCallernish, or even brave the jolting of a \"trap\" along the somewhat\r\nrough road that leads from Tarbert to Rodel, in order to inspect the\r\npicturesque little chapel there, and take rubbings of its quaint\r\ntombstones with their recumbent effigies of knights, and Crusaders'\r\nswords, and somewhat incomprehensible Latinity. Occasionally a few\r\nbolder spirits may be tempted by the guide-books to visit Barra Head,\r\nwith its ruddy cliffs and clouds of noisy sea-birds, or even to run\r\nnorth to the extremity of the Long Island to view the wonders of\r\nthe Butt of Lewis. But, as a rule, the few summer visitants who are\r\nlanded at Stornoway content themselves with a general inspection of\r\nthe grounds about Sir James Mathieson's residence, while those who\r\nare dropped at Tarbert on Saturday are usually quite ready to depart\r\non Monday with the steamer that brought them. The fact is that hotel\r\naccommodation in the Outer Hebrides is rather limited, and the means\r\nof locomotion through the islands is on the same slender scale. Those,\r\ntherefore, who are not able and willing to rough it had better not\r\nventure far beyond Tarbert and Stornoway.\r\n\r\nWhen the islands are first approached they present, it must be\r\nconfessed, a somewhat forbidding aspect. Bare, bleak rocks, with a\r\nmonotonous rounded outline, crowd along the shore, and seem to form\r\nall but the very highest portions of the land that meet our view,\r\nwhile such areas of low-ground as we can catch a glimpse of appear\r\nto be everywhere covered with a dusky mantle of heath and peat. But,\r\nalthough the general character of the scenery is thus tame and sombre,\r\nyet there are certain districts which in their wild picturesqueness are\r\nhardly surpassed by many places in the northern Highlands, while one\r\nmay search the coast-line of the mainland in vain for cliffs to compare\r\nwith those gaunt walls of rock, against which the great rollers of the\r\nAtlantic continually surge and thunder. It is wonderful, too, how,\r\nunder the influence of a light-blue sky, flecked with shining silvery\r\nclouds, the sombre peat-lands lighten up and glow with regal purple and\r\nruddy brown. With such a sky above him, and with a lively breeze fresh\r\nfrom the Atlantic and laden with the sweetness of clover and meadow-hay\r\nand heather-bloom sweeping gaily past him, what wanderer in the Outer\r\nHebrides need be pitied? And such days are by no means so rare in these\r\nislands as many a jaundiced Lowlander has maintained. It is true that\r\nheavy mists and drizzling rain are often provokingly prevalent, and I\r\ncannot forget the experience of a sad-hearted exile, who had resided\r\ncontinuously for a year in Lewis, and who, upon being asked what kind\r\nof climate that island enjoyed, replied: \"Sir, it has no climate. There\r\nare nine months of winter, and three months of very bad weather.\" For\r\nmyself, I can say that my experience of the climate in June, July, and\r\nearly August of several years has been decidedly favourable. During\r\nthose months I found comparatively few days in which a very fair\r\namount of walking and climbing could not be accomplished with ease and\r\npleasure, and that is a good deal more than one could venture to say\r\nof Skye and many parts of the west coast of the mainland. The greatest\r\ndrawback to one's comfort are the midges, which in these islands\r\nare beyond measure bloodthirsty, and quite as obnoxious as the most\r\ncarnivorous mosquitoes. Smoking, and all the other arts and devices by\r\nwhich the designs of these tiny pests are usually circumvented, have\r\nno effect upon the Hebridean vampires. In the low-grounds especially\r\nthey make life a burden. But those who have already become acquainted\r\nwith the Ross-shire midges, and yet have preserved their equanimity,\r\nmay feel justified in braving the ferocity of the Hebridean hosts. And\r\nif they do so I believe they will be well repaid for their courage. To\r\nthe hardy pedestrian, especially, who likes to escape from the beaten\r\ntrack laid down in guide-books, it will be a pleasure in itself to\r\nroam over a region which has not yet come entirely under the dominion\r\nof Mr. Cook. If he be simply a lover of the picturesque he will yet\r\nnot be disappointed, and possibly he may pick up a few hints in these\r\nnotes as to those districts which are most likely to repay him for his\r\ntoil in reaching them. But if to his love of the picturesque he joins\r\na taste for archæological pursuits, then I can assure him there is a\r\nrich and by no means exhausted field of study in the antiquities of the\r\nLong Island. Interesting, however, as are the relics of prehistoric and\r\nlater times which one meets with, yet it is the geologist, perhaps, who\r\nwill be most rewarded by a visit to these islands.\r\n\r\nThe physical features of the Outer Hebrides are, as already stated,\r\nsomewhat monotonous, but this is quite consistent with considerable\r\nvariety of scenic effect. All the islands are not equally attractive,\r\nalthough the configuration of hills and low-grounds remains\r\npersistently the same from the Butt of Lewis to Barra Head. The most\r\nconsiderable island is that of which Lewis and Harris form the northern\r\nand southern portions respectively. By far the larger part of the\r\nformer is undulating moorland, the only really mountainous district\r\nbeing that which adjoins Harris in the south. A good general idea\r\nof the moorlands is obtained by crossing the island from Stornoway\r\nto Garrynahine. What appeared at first to be only one vast extended\r\npeat-bog is then seen to be a gently-undulating country, coated, it\r\nis true, with much peat in the hollows, but clad for the most part\r\nwith heath, through which ever and anon peer bare rocks and rocky\r\ndébris. Now and again, indeed, especially towards the centre of the\r\nisland, the ground rises into rough round-topped hills, sprinkled\r\nsparingly with vegetation. One of the most striking features of the\r\nlow-grounds, however, is the enormous number of freshwater lakes,\r\nwhich are so abundant as to form no small proportion of the surface.\r\nThey are, as a rule, most irregular in outline, but have a tendency to\r\narrange themselves in two directions--one set trending from south-east\r\nto north-west, while another series is drawn out, as it were, from\r\nsouth-west to north-east. I am sure that I am within the mark in\r\nestimating the freshwater lakes in the low-grounds of Lewis to be at\r\nleast five hundred in number. In the mountain-district the lakes are,\r\nof course, confined to the valleys, and vary in direction accordingly.\r\n\r\nHarris and the southern part of Lewis are wholly mountainous, and show\r\nhardly a single acre of level ground. The mountains are often bold and\r\npicturesque, especially those which are over 1600 feet in height. They\r\nare also exceedingly bare and desolate, the vegetation on their slopes\r\nbeing poor and scanty in the extreme. Some of the hills, indeed, are\r\nabsolutely barren. In North Harris we find the highest peaks of the\r\nOuter Hebrides: these are the Clisham, 2622 feet, and the Langa, 2438\r\nfeet. The glens in this elevated district are often wild and rugged,\r\nsuch as the Bealach-Miavag and the Bealach-na-Ciste, both of which open\r\non West Loch Tarbert. But amid all this ruggedness and wild disorder\r\nof broken crag and beetling precipice, even a very non-observant eye\r\ncan hardly fail to notice that the general contour or configuration of\r\nthe hills is smooth, rounded, and flowing, up to a rather well-marked\r\nlevel, above which the outline becomes broken and interrupted, and all\r\nthe rounded and smoothed appearance vanishes. The contrast between the\r\nsmoothly-flowing contour of the lower elevations and the shattered and\r\nriven aspect of the harsh ridges, sharp peaks, and craggy tors above,\r\nis particularly striking. The mammillated and dome-shaped masses have\r\na pale, ghastly grey hue, their broad bare surfaces reflecting the\r\nlight freely, while at higher elevations the abundant irregularities\r\nof the rocks throw many shadows, and impart a darker aspect to the\r\nmountain-tops.\r\n\r\nThe appearances now described are very well seen along the shores of\r\nWest Loch Tarbert. All the hills that abut upon that loch show smoothed\r\nand rounded faces, and this character prevails up to a height of 1600\r\nfeet, or thereabout, when all at once it gives way, and a broken,\r\ninterrupted contour succeeds. Thus the top of the Tarcall ridge in\r\nSouth Harris is dark, rough, and irregular, while the slopes below are\r\ngrey, smooth, and flowing. The same is conspicuously the case with the\r\nmountains in North Harris, the ruinous and sombre-looking summits of\r\nthe Langa and the Clisham soaring for several hundred feet above the\r\npale grey mammillated hills that sweep downwards to the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter having familiarised themselves with the aspect of the hills\r\nas seen from below, the lover of the picturesque, not less than the\r\ngeologist, will do well to ascend some dominant point from which an\r\nextensive bird's-eye view can be obtained. For such purpose I can\r\nrecommend the Tarcall and Roneval in South Harris, the Clisham and the\r\nLanga in North Harris, and Suainabhal in Lewis. The view from these\r\nhills is wonderfully extensive and very impressive. From Suainabhal one\r\ncommands nearly all Lewis; and what a weird picture of desolation it\r\nis! An endless succession of bare, grey, round-backed rocks and hills,\r\nwith countless lakes and lakelets nestling in their hollows, undulates\r\noutwards over the districts of Uig and Pairc. Away to the north spread\r\nthe great moorlands with their lochans, while immediately to the south\r\none catches a fine panoramic view of the mountains of Harris. And then\r\nthose long straggling arms of the sea, reaching into the very heart of\r\nthe island--how blue, and bright, and fresh they look! I suppose the\r\nnatives of the Lewis must have been fishermen from the very earliest\r\ntimes. It seems hardly possible otherwise to believe that the bare\r\nrocks and peat-bogs, which form the major portion of its surface,\r\ncould ever have supported a large population; and yet there is every\r\nevidence to show that this part of the Long Island was tolerably well\r\npopulated in very early days. The great standing-stones of Callernish\r\nand the many other monoliths, both solitary and in groups, that are\r\nscattered along the west coast of Lewis, surely betoken as much. And\r\nthose curious round towers, or places of refuge and defence, which are\r\nso well represented in the same district, although they may be much\r\nyounger in date than the monoliths of Callernish, tell the same tale.\r\n\r\nFrom the summits of the Clisham and the Langa the view is finer than\r\nthat obtained from Suainabhal. The former overlook all the high-grounds\r\nof Harris and Lewis, and the monotonous moors with their countless\r\nstraggling lakes and peaty tarns. Indeed, they dominate nearly the\r\nwhole of the Long Island, the hills of distant Barra being quite\r\ndistinguishable. Of course, the lofty island of Rum, and Skye with\r\nits Coolins, are both clearly visible, the whole view being framed in\r\nto eastward by the mountains of Ross and Sutherland. On a clear day,\r\nwhich, unfortunately, I did not get, one should be quite able to see\r\nSt. Kilda. Hardly less extensive is the view obtained from Roneval\r\n(1506 feet) in the south of Harris. Far away to the west lie St. Kilda\r\nand its little sister islet of Borerey. Southwards stretch the various\r\nislands of the Outer Hebrides--North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, and\r\nBarra. How plainly visible they all are--a screen of high mountains\r\nfacing the Minch, and extending, apparently, along their whole eastern\r\nmargin--with broad lake-dappled plains sweeping out from the foot-hills\r\nto the Atlantic. In the east, Skye with its spiky Coolins spreads\r\nbefore one, and north of Skye we easily distinguish Ben Slioch and\r\nthe mountains of Loch Maree and Loch Torridon. South Harris lies, of\r\ncourse, under our feet, and it is hard to give one who has not seen it\r\nan adequate notion of its sterile desolation. Round-backed hills and\r\nrocks innumerable, scraped bare of any soil, and supporting hardly a\r\nvestige of vegetation; heavy mountain-masses with a similar rounded\r\ncontour, and equally naked and desolate; blue lakelets scattered in\r\nhundreds among the hollows and depressions of the land: such is the\r\ngeneral appearance of the rocky wilderness that stretches inland from\r\nthe shores of the Minch. Then all around lies the great blue sea,\r\nshining like sapphire in the sun, and flecked with tiny sails, where\r\nthe fishermen are busy at their calling.\r\n\r\nFrom what has now been said, it will readily be understood that there\r\nis not much cultivable land in Harris and the hilly parts of Lewis.\r\nWhat little there is occurs chiefly along the west coast, a character\r\nwhich we shall find is common to most of the islands of the Outer\r\nHebrides. In the neighbourhood of Stornoway, and over considerable\r\nareas along the whole west coast of Lewis, the moorlands have been\r\nbroken in upon by spade and plough, with more or less success. But\r\nnatural meadow-lands, such as are frequently met with on the west side\r\nof many of the islands both of the Outer and Inner Hebrides, are not\r\nvery common in Lewis.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable features of the hillier parts of the Long\r\nIsland are the enormous numbers of loose stones and boulders which are\r\neverywhere scattered about on hill-top, hill-side, and valley-bottom.\r\nHarris is literally peppered with them, and they are hardly less\r\nabundant in the other islands. They are of all shapes and sizes--round,\r\nsub-angular, and angular. One great block in Barra I estimated to\r\nweigh seven hundred and seventy tons. Many measure over three or\r\nfour yards across, while myriads are much smaller. These boulders are\r\nsometimes utilised in a singular way. In Harris, there being only one\r\nburial-place, the poor people have often to carry their dead a long\r\ndistance, and this of course necessitates resting on the journey. To\r\nmark the spot where they have rested, the mourners are wont to erect\r\nlittle cairns by the road-side, many of which are neatly built in the\r\nform of cones and pyramids, while others are mere shapeless heaps of\r\nstones thrown loosely together. Instead of raising cairns, however,\r\nthey occasionally select some boulder, and make it serve the purpose by\r\ncanting it up and inserting one or more stones underneath. Occasionally\r\nI have seen in various parts of the mainland great boulders cocked\r\nup at one end in the same way. Some of these may be in their natural\r\nposition, but as they often occupy conspicuous and commanding\r\nsituations, I am inclined to think that the cromlech-builders may have\r\ntampered with them for memorial purposes. The present custom of the\r\nHarris men may therefore be a survival from that far-distant period\r\nwhen Callernish was in its glory.\r\n\r\nNorth Uist is truly a land of desolation and dreariness. Bare, rocky\r\nhills, which are remarkable for their sterile nakedness even in the\r\nLong Island, form the eastern margin, and from the foot of these the\r\nlow, undulating rocky and peaty land stretches for some ten or twelve\r\nmiles to the Atlantic. The land is everywhere intersected by long,\r\nstraggling inlets of sea-water, and sprinkled with lakes and peaty\r\ntarns innumerable. Along the flat Atlantic coast, which is overlooked\r\nby some sparsely-clad hills, are dreary stretches of yellow sand\r\nblown up into dunes. Near these are a few huts and a kirk and manse.\r\nNot a tree, not even a bush higher than heather, is to be seen.\r\nPeat, and water, and rock; rock, and water, and peat--that is North\r\nUist. The neighbourhood of Lochmaddy, which is the residence of a\r\nsheriff-substitute, and rejoices besides in the possession of a jail,\r\nis depressing in the extreme. It is made up of irregular bits of flat\r\nland all jumbled about in a shallow sea, so that to get to a place one\r\nmile in direct distance you may have to walk five or six miles, or even\r\nmore. I could not but agree with the natives of the more coherent parts\r\nof the Long Island, who are wont to declare that Lochmaddy is only \"the\r\nclippings of creation\"--the odds and ends and scraps left over after\r\nthe better lands were finished. North Uist, however, boasts of some\r\ninteresting antiquities--Picts' houses, and a great cairn called the\r\nBarp, inside of which, according to tradition, rest the remains of a\r\nwicked prince of the \"good old days.\" Notwithstanding these, there are\r\nprobably few visitors who will not pronounce North Uist to be a dreary\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nBenbecula is precisely like North Uist, but it lacks the bare mountains\r\nof the latter. There is only one hill, indeed, in Benbecula; all the\r\nrest is morass, peat, and water.\r\n\r\nMassive mountains fringe all the eastern shores of South Uist, and\r\nsend westward numerous spurs and foot-hills that encroach upon the\r\n\"machars,\" or good lands, so as to reduce then to a mere narrow strip,\r\nbordering on the Atlantic. Save the summits of Beinn Mhor (2033 feet)\r\nand Hecla (1988 feet), which are peaked and rugged, all the hills show\r\nthe characteristic flowing outline which has already been described in\r\nconnection with the physical features of Harris. The low-grounds are,\r\nas usual, thickly studded with lakes, and large loose boulders are\r\nscattered about in all directions.\r\n\r\nBarra is wholly mountainous, and, except that it is somewhat less\r\nsterile, closely resembles Harris in its physical features, the hills\r\nbeing smoothed, rounded, and bare, especially on the side of the island\r\nthat faces the Minch. Of the smaller islands that lie to the south,\r\nsuch as Papey, Miuley, and Bearnarey, the most noteworthy features are\r\nthe lofty cliffs which they present to the Atlantic. For the rest, they\r\nshow precisely the same appearances as the hillier and barer portions\r\nof the larger islands--rounded rocks with an undulating outline, dotted\r\nover with loose stones and boulders, and now and again half-smothered\r\nin yellow sand, which the strong winds blow in upon them.\r\n\r\nThere is thus, as I have said, considerable uniformity and even\r\nmonotony throughout the whole range of the Outer Hebrides. I\r\nspeak, however, chiefly as a geologist. An artist, no doubt, will\r\nfind infinite variety, and as he wends his way by moorland, or\r\nmountain-glen, or sea-shore, scenes are constantly coming into\r\nview which he will be fain to transfer to his sketch-book. The\r\ncolour-effects, too, are often surprisingly beautiful. When the rich\r\nmeadow-lands of the west coast are in all their glory, they show many\r\ndazzling tints and shades, the deep tender green being dashed and\r\nflushed with yellow, and purple, and scarlet, and blue, over which the\r\ndelighted eye wanders to a belt of bright sand upon the shore, and the\r\nvast azure expanse of the Atlantic beyond. Inland are the heath-clad\r\nmoors, sprinkled with grey boulders and masses of barren rock, and\r\ninterspersed with lakes, some of which are starred with clusters of\r\nlovely water-lilies. Behind the moorlands, again, rise the grim,\r\nbald mountains, seamed and scarred with gullies, and in their very\r\ngeneral nakedness and sterility offering the strongest contrast to the\r\nvariegated border of russet moor, and green meadow, and yellow beach\r\nthat fringe the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nAll through the islands, indeed, the artist will come upon interesting\r\nsubjects. A most impressive scene may sometimes be witnessed on\r\ncrossing the North Ford, between North Uist and Benbecula. At\r\nlow-water, the channel or sound between these two islands, which is\r\nfive miles in breadth, disappears and leaves exposed a wide expanse\r\nof wet sand and silt, dotted with black rocks and low tangle-covered\r\nreefs and skerries. On the morning I passed over, ragged sheets of mist\r\nhung low down on the near horizon, half-obscuring and half-revealing\r\nthe stony islets, and crags, and hills that lay between the ford and\r\nthe Minch. Seen through such a medium, the rocks assumed the most\r\nsurprising forms, sometimes towering into great peaks and cliffs,\r\nat other times breaking up, as it were, into low reefs and shoals,\r\nand anon dissolving in grey mist and vapour. At other times the thin\r\ncloud-curtain would lift, and then one fancied one saw some vast city\r\nwith ponderous walls and battlements, and lofty towers and steeples,\r\nrising into the mist-wreaths that hung above it, while from many points\r\non the Benbecula coast, where kelp was being prepared, clouds of smoke\r\ncurled slowly upwards, as if from the camp-fires of some besieging\r\narmy. The track of the ford winds round and about innumerable rocks,\r\nupon which a number of \"natives,\" each stooping solitary and silent to\r\nhis or her work, were reaping the luxuriant seaweed for kelp-making.\r\nTheir silence was quite in keeping with the general stillness, which\r\nwould have been unbroken but for the harsh scream of the sea-birds, as\r\nthey ever and anon rose scared from their favourite feeding-grounds\r\nwhile we plodded and plashed on our way. The artist who could\r\nsuccessfully cope with such a scene would paint a singularly weird and\r\nsuggestive picture.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the physical features of the Long Island, what, we\r\nmay ask, is the cause of that general monotony of outline to which\r\nreference has so frequently been made? At first we seem to get an\r\nanswer to our question when we are told that the islands of the Outer\r\nHebrides are composed chiefly of one and the same kind of rock.\r\nEveryone nowadays has some knowledge of the fact that the peculiar\r\nfeatures of any given district are greatly due to the character and\r\narrangement of the rock-masses. For example, who is not familiar with\r\nthe outline of a chalk country, as distinguished from the contour of a\r\nregion the rocks of which are composed, let us say, of alternating beds\r\nof limestone and sandstone and masses of old volcanic material? The\r\nchalk country, owing to the homogeneousness of its component strata,\r\nhas been moulded by the action of weather and running water into an\r\nundulating region with a softly-flowing outline, while the district\r\nof composite formation has yielded unequally to the action of Time's\r\nworkers--rains, and frosts, and rivers--and so is diversified with\r\nridge, and escarpment, and knolls, and crags. When, therefore, we learn\r\nthat the Outer Hebrides are composed for the most part of the rock\r\ncalled _gneiss_ and its varieties, we seem to have at once found the\r\nmeaning of the uniformity and monotony. It is true that although pink\r\nand grey gneiss and schistose rocks prevail from the Butt of Lewis\r\nto Barra Head, yet there are some other varieties occasionally met\r\nwith--thus soft red sandstone and conglomerate rest upon the gneissic\r\nrocks near Stornoway, but they occur nowhere else throughout the Long\r\nIsland. Now and again, however, the gneiss gives place to granite, as\r\non the west coast of Lewis near Carloway; and here and there the strata\r\nare pierced by vertical dykes and curious twisted and reticulated veins\r\nof basalt-rock. All these, however, hold but a minor and unimportant\r\nplace as constituents of the islands. Gneiss is beyond question the\r\nmost prevalent rock, and we seem justified in assigning the peculiar\r\nmonotony of the Outer Hebridean scenery to that fact.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to examine the matter more attentively, we find that\r\nthere is still some important factor wanting. We have not got quite to\r\nthe solution of the question. When we study the manner in which the\r\ngneiss and gneissic rocks disintegrate and break up at the sea-coast\r\nor along the flanks of some rugged mountain-glen, we see they give\r\nrise to an irregular uneven surface. They do not naturally decompose\r\nand exfoliate into rounded dome-shaped masses, such as are so commonly\r\nmet with all through the islands, but rather tend to assume the aspect\r\nof rugged tors, and peaks, and ridges. The reason for this will be\r\nmore readily understood when it is learned that the gneissic rocks of\r\nthe Outer Hebrides are for the most part arranged in strata, which,\r\nnotwithstanding their immense antiquity--(they are the oldest rocks\r\nin Europe)--and the many changes they have undergone, are yet, as a\r\nrule, quite distinguishable. The strata are seldom or never horizontal,\r\nbut are usually inclined at a high angle, either to north-east or\r\nsouth-west, although sometimes, as in the vicinity of Stornoway, the\r\n\"dip\" or inclination of the beds is to south-east. Throughout the\r\nmajor portion of the Long Island, however, the outcrop of the strata\r\nruns transversely across the land from south-east to north-west. Now\r\nwe know that when this is the case strata of variable composition and\r\ncharacter give rise to long escarpments and intervening hollows--the\r\nescarpments marking the outcrops of the harder and more durable beds,\r\nand the hollows those strata that are softer and more easily eroded by\r\nthe action of the denuding forces, water and frost. When the dip of the\r\nstrata is north-east we expect the escarpments to face the south-west,\r\nand the reverse will be the case when the strata incline in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nSeeing then that the Outer Hebrides are composed chiefly of gneissic\r\nrocks and schists which yield unequally to the weather, and which, in\r\nthe course of time, would naturally give rise to lines of sharp-edged\r\nescarpments or ridges and intervening hollows, with now and again\r\nmassive hills and mountains showing great cliffs and a generally\r\nbroken and irregular outline, why is it that such rugged features are\r\nso seldom present at low levels, and are only conspicuous at the very\r\nhighest elevations? The rocks of the Outer Hebrides are of immense\r\nantiquity, and there has therefore been time enough for them to assume\r\nthe irregular contour which we might have expected. But in place of\r\nsharp-rimmed escarpments, and tors, and broken shattered ridges, we see\r\neverywhere a rounded and smoothly-flowing configuration which prevails\r\nup to a height of 1600 feet or thereabout, above which the rocks take\r\non the rugged appearance which is natural to them. By what magic have\r\nthe strata at the lower levels escaped in such large measure from the\r\naction of rain and frost, which have furrowed and shattered the higher\r\nmountain-tops?\r\n\r\nI have said that long lines of escarpment and ridges, corresponding to\r\nthe outcrops of the harder and more durable strata, are not apparent in\r\nthese islands. A trained eye, however, is not long in discovering that\r\nsuch features, although masked and obscured, are yet really present.\r\nThe round-backed rocks are drawn out, as it were, in one persistent\r\ndirection, which always agrees with the _strike_ or outcrop of the\r\nstrata; and in many districts one notices also that long hollows\r\ntraverse the land from south-east to north-west in the same way.\r\nSuch alternating hollows and rounded ridges are very conspicuous in\r\nBarra and the smaller islands to the south, and they may likewise be\r\nnoted in most of the larger islands also. Looking at these and other\r\nfeatures, the geologist has no hesitation in concluding that the whole\r\nof the islands have been subjected to some powerful abrading force,\r\nwhich has succeeded to a large extent in obliterating the primary\r\nconfiguration of the land. The rough ridges have been rounded off,\r\nthe sharp escarpments have been bevelled, the abrupt tors and peaks\r\nhave been smoothed down. Here and there, it is true, the dome-shaped\r\nrock-masses are beginning again to break up under the action of the\r\nweather so as to resume their original irregular configuration. And,\r\ndoubtless, after the lapse of many ages, rain and frost will gradually\r\nsucceed in destroying the present characteristic flowing outlines, and\r\nthe islands will then revert to their former condition, and rugged\r\nescarpments, sharp peaks, and rough broken hummocks and tors will again\r\nbecome the rule. But for a long time to come these grey Western Islands\r\nwill continue to present us with some of the most instructive examples\r\nof rounded and mammillated rock-masses to be met with in Europe.\r\nFrom Barra Head in Bearnarey to the Butt of Lewis we are constantly\r\nconfronted by proofs of the former presence of that mysterious abrading\r\npower, which has accommodated itself to all the sinuosities of the\r\nground, so that from the sea-level up to a height of 1600 feet at\r\nleast, the eye rests almost everywhere upon bare round-backed rocks and\r\nsmoothed surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding article I have described the peculiar configuration\r\nof the Long Island--rounded and flowing for the most part--and have\r\npointed out how that softened outline is not such as the rocks would\r\nnaturally assume under the influence of the ordinary agents of erosion\r\nwith which we are familiar in this country. The present contour has\r\nsuperseded an older set of features, which, although highly modified\r\nor disguised, and often well-nigh obliterated, are yet capable of\r\nbeing traced, and are, no doubt, the conformation assumed by the rocks\r\nunder the long-continued action of rain and frost and running water.\r\nWe have now to inquire what it was that removed or softened down the\r\nprimal configuration I refer to, and gave to the islands their present\r\nmonotonous, undulating contour.\r\n\r\nAny one fresh from the glacier-valleys of Switzerland or Norway could\r\nhave little doubt as to the cause of the transformation. The smoothed\r\nand rounded masses of the Outer Hebrides are so exactly paralleled by\r\nthe ice-worn, dome-shaped rocks over which a glacier has flowed, that\r\nour visitor would have small hesitation in ascribing to them a similar\r\norigin; and the presence of the countless perched blocks and boulders\r\nwhich are scattered broadcast over the islands would tend to confirm\r\nhim in his belief. A closer inspection of the phenomena would soon\r\nbanish all doubt from his mind; for, on the less-weathered surfaces,\r\nhe would detect those long parallel scratches and furrows which are\r\nthe sure signs of glacial action, while, in the hollows and over the\r\nlow-grounds, he would be confronted with that peculiar deposit of\r\nclay and sand and glaciated stones and boulders which are dragged on\r\nunderneath flowing ice.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied ourselves that the rounded outline of the ground is\r\nthe result of former glacial action, our next step is to discover, if\r\nwe can, in what direction the abrading agent moved. Did the ice, as\r\nwe might have supposed, come out of the mountain-valleys and overflow\r\nthe low country? If that had been the case, then we should expect to\r\nfind the glacial markings radiating outwards in all directions from\r\nthe higher elevations. Thus the low-grounds of Uig, in Lewis, should\r\ngive evidence of having been overflowed by ice coming from the Forest\r\nof Harris; the undulating, rocky, and lake-dappled region that extends\r\nbetween Loch Roag and Loch Erisort should be abraded and striated\r\nfrom south-west to north-east. Instead of this, however, the movement\r\nhas clearly been from south-east to north-west. All the prominent\r\nrock-faces that look towards the Minch have been smoothed off and\r\nrounded, while in their rear the marks of rubbing and abrading are much\r\nless conspicuous. It is evident that the south-east exposure has borne\r\nthe full brunt of the ice-grinding--the surfaces that are turned in the\r\nopposite direction, or towards the Atlantic, having been in a measure\r\nprotected or sheltered by their position. The striations or scratches\r\nthat are seen upon the less-weathered surfaces point invariably towards\r\nthe north-west, and from their character and the mode in which they\r\nhave been graved upon the rock, we are left in no doubt as to the trend\r\nof the old ice-plough--which was clearly from south-east to north-west.\r\nNor is it only the low-grounds that are marked in this direction.\r\nAscend Suaina (1300 feet), and you shall find it showing evident signs\r\nof having been abraded all over, from base to summit. The same, indeed,\r\nis the case with all the hills that stretch from sea to sea between\r\nUig and Loch Seaforth. Beinn Mheadonach, Ceann Resort, Griosamul, and\r\nLiuthaid, are all strongly glaciated from south-east to north-west.\r\n\r\nNorth and South Harris yield unequivocal evidence of having been\r\noverflowed by ice which did not stream out of the mountain-valleys,\r\nbut crossed the island from the Minch to the Atlantic. A number of\r\nmountain-glens, coming down from the Forest of Harris, open out\r\nupon West Loch Tarbert, and these we see have been crossed at right\r\nangles by the ice--the mountains between them being strongly abraded\r\nfrom south-east to north-west. It is the same all over South Harris,\r\nwhich affords the geologist every evidence of having been literally\r\nsmothered in ice, which has moved in the same persistent direction. The\r\nrock-faces that look towards the Minch are all excessively naked; they\r\nhave been terribly ground down and scraped, and the same holds good\r\nwith every part of the island exposed to the south-east.\r\n\r\nNow, the mode in which the rocks have been so ground, scraped, rounded,\r\nand smoothed betokens very clearly the action of land-ice, and not of\r\nfloating-ice or icebergs. The abrading agent has accommodated itself\r\nto all the sinuosities of the ground, sliding into hollows and creeping\r\nout of them, moulding itself over projecting rocks, so as eventually to\r\ngrind away all their asperities, and convert rugged tors and peaks into\r\nround-backed, dome-shaped masses. It has carried away the sharp edges\r\nof escarpments and ridges, and has deepened the intervening hollows in\r\na somewhat irregular way, so that now these catch the drainage of the\r\nland and form lakes. Steep rocks facing the Minch have been bevelled\r\noff and rounded atop, while in their rear the ice-plough, not being\r\nable to act with effect, has not succeeded in removing the primeval\r\nruggedness of the weathered strata.\r\n\r\nI have said that the movement of the ice was from south-east to\r\nnorth-west. But a close examination of the ice-markings will show that\r\nthe flow was very frequently influenced by the form of the ground.\r\nMinor features it was able to disregard, but some prominent projecting\r\nrock-masses succeeded in deflecting the ice that flowed against them.\r\nFor example, if we study the rocks in North Harris, we shall find that\r\nthe Langa and the Clisham have served as a wedge to divide the ice,\r\npart of which flowed away into Lewis, while the other current or stream\r\ncrept out to sea by West Loch Tarbert. The Langa and the Clisham,\r\nindeed, raised their heads above the glacier mass--they were islets in\r\na sea of ice. It is for this reason that they and the Tarcull ridge in\r\nSouth Harris have not been smoothed and abraded, but still preserve\r\ntheir weathered outline. All surfaces below a height of 1600 feet which\r\nare exposed to the south-east, and which have not been in recent times\r\nbroken up by the action of rain and frost, exhibit strongly-marked\r\nglaciation. But above that level no signs of ancient ice-work can be\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nWe see now why it is that the hill-slopes opposite the Minch should,\r\nas a rule, be so much more sterile than those which slope down to the\r\nAtlantic. The full force of the ice was exerted upon the south-east\r\nfront, in the rear of which there would necessarily be comparatively\r\n\"quiet\" ice. For the same reason we should expect to find much of the\r\nrock débris which the ice swept off the south-east front sheltering on\r\nthe opposite side. Neither clay nor sand nor stones would gather under\r\nthe ice upon the steep rocks that face the Minch. The movement there\r\nwas too severe to permit of any such accumulation. But stones and clay\r\nand sand were carried over and swept round the hills, and gradually\r\naccumulated in the rear of the ice-worn rocks, just in the same way as\r\ngravel and sand are heaped up behind projecting stones and boulders\r\nin the bed of a stream. Hence it is that the western margin of Harris\r\nis so much less bleak than the opposite side. Considerable taluses\r\nof \"till,\" as the sub-glacial débris is called, gather behind the\r\nsteeper crags, and ragged sheets of the same material extend over the\r\nlow-grounds. All the low-grounds of Lewis are in like manner sprinkled\r\nwith till. Over that region the ice met with but few obstacles to its\r\ncourse, and consequently the débris it forced along underneath was\r\nspread out somewhat equally. But wherever hills and peaks and hummocks\r\nof rock broke the regularity of the surface, there great abrasion took\r\nplace and no till was accumulated.\r\n\r\nThus the position and distribution of this sub-glacial débris or\r\nbottom-moraine tell the same tale as the abraded rocks and glacial\r\nstriæ, and clearly indicate an ice-flow from the south-east. This is\r\nstill further proved by the manner in which the upturned ends of the\r\nstrata are frequently bent over underneath the till in a north-westerly\r\ndirection, while the fragments dislodged from them and enclosed in the\r\nsub-glacial débris stream away as it were to the same point of the\r\ncompass. Not only so, but in the west of Lewis, where no red sandstone\r\noccurs, we find boulders of red sandstone enclosed in the till, which\r\ncould not have been derived from any place nearer than Stornoway. In\r\nother words, these boulders have travelled across the island from the\r\nshores of the Minch to the Atlantic sea-board.\r\n\r\nHaving said so much about the glaciation of Lewis and Harris, I need\r\nnot do more than indicate very briefly some of the more interesting\r\nfeatures of the islands further south.\r\n\r\nI spent some time cruising up and down the Sound of Harris, and found\r\nthat all the islets there had been ground and scraped by ice flowing\r\nin the normal north-west direction, and sub-glacial débris occurs on\r\nat least one of the little islands--Harmetrey. But all the phenomena\r\nof glaciation are met with in most abundance in the dreary island of\r\nNorth Uist. The ridge of mountains that guards its east coast has been\r\nbattered, and ground down, and scraped bare in the most wonderful\r\nmanner, while the melancholy moorlands are everywhere sprinkled with\r\ntill, full of glaciated stones, many of which have travelled west\r\nfrom the coast range. Benbecula shows in like manner a considerable\r\nsprinkling of till, and the trend of the glacial striæ is the same\r\nthere as in North Uist, namely, a little north of west. There are no\r\nhills of any consequence in Benbecula, but the highly-abraded and\r\nbarren-looking mountains that fringe the eastern margin of North Uist\r\nare continued south in the islands of Roney and Fuiey, either of which\r\nit would be hard to surpass as examples of the prodigious effect of\r\nland-ice in scouring, scraping, and grinding the surface over which it\r\nmoves.\r\n\r\nSouth Uist presents the same general configuration as North Uist,\r\nits east coast being formed of a long range of intensely glaciated\r\nmountains, in the rear of which ragged sheets and heaps of sub-glacial\r\ndébris are thrown and scattered over the low, undulating tract that\r\nborders the Atlantic. No part of either Benbecula or North Uist has\r\nescaped the action of ice, but in South Uist that knot of high-ground\r\nwhich is dominated by the fine mountains of Beinn Mhor and Hecla\r\ntowered above the level of the glacier-mass, and have thus been the\r\ncause of considerable deflection of the ice-flow. The ice-stream\r\ndivided, as it were, part flowing round the north flank of Hecla,\r\nand part streaming past the southern slopes of Beinn Mhor. But the\r\nice-flow thus divided speedily reunited in the rear of the mountains,\r\nthe southern stream creeping in from the south-east, and the northern\r\nstream stealing round Hecla towards the south-west. The track of this\r\nremarkable deflection and reunion is clearly marked out by numerous\r\nstriæ all over the low-grounds that slope outwards to the Atlantic\r\ncoast. The till, it need hardly be added, affords the same kind of\r\nevidence as the sub-glacial deposits of the other islands, and points\r\nunmistakably to a general ice-movement across South Uist from the Minch\r\nto the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe influence which an irregular surface has in causing local\r\ndeflections of an ice-flow is also well seen in Barra, where the striæ\r\nsometimes point some 5° or 10°, and sometimes 25° and even 35° north of\r\nwest--these variations being entirely due to the configuration of the\r\nground. This island is extremely bare in many places, more especially\r\nover all the region that slopes to the Minch. The Atlantic border is\r\nsomewhat better covered with soil, as is the case with South Uist and\r\nthe other islands already described.\r\n\r\nVatersey, Saundry, Papey, Miuley, and Bearnarey, are all equally well\r\nglaciated; but as they show little or no low-ground with gentle slopes,\r\nthey have preserved few traces of sub-glacial débris. In this respect\r\nthey resemble the rockier and hillier parts of the large islands to\r\nthe north. Till, however, is occasionally met with, as for example on\r\nthe low shores of Vatersey Bay, and on the southern margin of Miuley.\r\nDoubtless, if it were carefully looked for it would be found sheltering\r\nin patches in many nooks and hollows, protected from the grind of the\r\nice that advanced from the south-east. I saw it in several such places\r\nin the islet of Bearnarey, where the striæ indicated an ice-flow as\r\nusual towards the north-west.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that the whole of the Long Island has been ground,\r\nand rubbed, and scraped by land- or glacier-ice which has traversed\r\nthe ground in a prevalent south-east and north-west direction. We have\r\nseen also that this ice attained so great a thickness that it was able\r\nto overflow all the hills up to a height of 1600 feet above the sea.\r\nIt is needless to say that such a mass could not have been nurtured on\r\nthe islands themselves. They have no gathering grounds of sufficient\r\nextent, and if they had, the ice would not have taken the peculiar\r\ndirection it did. Instead of flowing across the islands it would have\r\nradiated outwards from the mountain-valleys. Where, then, did the ice\r\ncome from?\r\n\r\nLooking across the Minch we see Skye and the mountains of the\r\nnorth-west Highlands, and those regions, as we know, have also been\r\nsubjected to extreme glaciation. From the appearances presented by\r\nthe mountains of Ross-shire we are compelled to believe that all that\r\nregion was buried in ice up to a height of not less than 3000 feet--the\r\nice-sheet was probably even as much as 3500 feet in thickness. The\r\nevidence shows that the under portion of this vast ice-sheet flowed\r\nslowly off the country into the Minch by way of the great sea-lochs.\r\nThus we know that an enormous mass crept down Loch Carron and united\r\nwith another great stream stealing out from the mountains of Skye, to\r\nflow north through the hollows of Raasay Sound and the Inner Sound\r\ninto the Minch. So deep was the ice that it completely smothered the\r\nisland of Raasay (1272 feet high) and overflowed all the lofty trappean\r\ntable-lands of Skye. From the Coolins, as a centre-point, another\r\nmovement of the ice-sheet was towards the south-west, against the\r\nislands of Rum, Cannay, and Eigg. Further north similar vast masses of\r\nice streamed out into the Minch, from Loch Torridon, Gairloch, Loch\r\nEwe, and Loch Broom. The direction of the glaciation in the north of\r\nSkye, which is towards north-west, shows that the glacier-mass which\r\noverflowed that area must eventually have reached the shores of the\r\nLong Island. In short, there cannot be a reasonable doubt that the\r\nimmense sheet of ice that streamed off the north-west Highlands must\r\nhave filled up entirely the basin of the Minch, and thereafter streamed\r\nacross the Outer Hebrides. But it may be objected that if the Outer\r\nHebrides were overflowed by ice that streamed from the mainland across\r\nthe north end of Skye, we ought to get many fragments of Skye rocks\r\nand Ross-shire rocks too in the sub-glacial débris or till of Lewis\r\nand Harris, and the north end of North Uist. But all such fragments\r\nare apparently wanting. True, there are bits of stone like the igneous\r\nrocks of Skye often met with in the Hebridean till, but as veins or\r\ndykes of precisely the same kind of rock occur in the Long Island\r\nitself, we cannot say that the stones referred to are other than\r\nnative. A little reflection will show us, however, that it is extremely\r\nimprobable indeed that stones derived from Skye and the mainland should\r\never have been dragged on under the ice, and deposited amongst the till\r\nof the Long Island. There is only one part of the whole Outer Hebrides\r\nwhere we might have anticipated that fragments from the mainland should\r\noccur; and there, sure enough, they put in an appearance.\r\n\r\nBut before I attempt to explain the non-occurrence of Skye rocks in\r\nthe till of the Outer Hebrides, let me show in a few words what the\r\nglaciation of the Long Island, Skye, and the north-west Highlands\r\nteaches us as to the general aspect presented by the ice-sheet. The\r\nheight reached by the surface of the ice in Ross-shire and the Long\r\nIsland respectively indicates of course that the main movement was\r\nfrom the mainland. We must conceive of an immense sheet of solid ice\r\nfilling up all the inequalities of the land, obliterating the glens,\r\nand sweeping across the hill-tops; and not only so, but occupying the\r\nwide basin of the Minch to the entire exclusion of the sea, the surface\r\nof the ice rising so high that it overtopped the whole of the Outer\r\nHebrides, and left only the tips of a few of the higher mountains\r\nuncovered. The slope of the surface was persistently outwards from the\r\nmainland, and the striation of the Long Island indicates clearly that\r\nthe dip or inclination of that surface was towards the north-west. Nay,\r\nmore than this, we are now enabled for the first time to say with some\r\napproach to certainty what was the precise angle of that inclination.\r\nIf we take the upper surface of the ice in Ross-shire to have been 3000\r\nfeet (and it was not less), then the slope between the mainland and\r\nthe Outer Hebrides was only 25 feet in the mile, or about 1 in 210. It\r\nis quite possible, however, and even probable, that the actual height\r\nattained by the ice-sheet in the north-west Highlands was more than\r\n3000 feet. I think it may yet turn out to have been 3500 feet, and if\r\nthis were so it would give an inclination for the surface of the ice of\r\nabout 35 feet in the mile. In either case the slope was so very gentle\r\nthat to the eye it would have appeared like a level plain. Over the\r\nsurface of this plain would be scattered here and there a solitary big\r\nerratic or two, while in other places long trains of large and small\r\nangular boulders would stream outwards. All these would be derived from\r\nsuch mountain in Skye and the mainland as were able to keep their heads\r\nabove the level of the ice-flow; while a few also might be dislodged by\r\nthe frost and rolled down upon the glacier from the tips of the Clisham\r\nand the Langa in Harris, and Hecla and Beinn Mhor in South Uist. Every\r\nsuch block, it is evident, would be carried across the buried Hebrides,\r\nout into the Atlantic in the direction indicated by the glaciation of\r\nthe Long Island--that is, towards the north-west.\r\n\r\nBut while the upper strata of the ice doubtless followed that\r\nparticular course, it is obvious that this could not be the case\r\nwith the under portion of the great sheet, the path of which would\r\nbe controlled in large measure by the form of the ground over which\r\nthe ice moved. The upper strata that overflowed the Outer Hebrides,\r\nas we have seen, were locally deflected again and again by important\r\nobstacles, and it is quite certain that the same would take place with\r\nthe deeper portions of the ice-flow.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the sea along the inner margin of the Long Island\r\nis very deep. In many places it reaches a depth of 600 feet, and\r\noccasionally the sounding-lead plunges down for upwards of 700 feet.\r\nIt would seem, however, that these great depths did not exist before\r\nthe advent of the ice-sheet, but that the bottom of the Minch along\r\nthe eastern borders of the Long Island was then some 250 or 300 feet\r\nshallower than now, the floor of the sea having since been excavated\r\nin the manner I shall presently describe. It is quite apparent,\r\ntherefore, that the long ridge of the Outer Hebrides must have offered\r\nan insuperable obstacle to the direct passage of the bottom-ice out\r\nto the Atlantic. Here was a great wall of rock shooting up from the\r\nfloor of the Minch, at a high angle, to a height ranging in elevation\r\nfrom 400 feet to upwards of 3000 feet. It is simply impossible that\r\nthe lower strata of the ice that occupied the bed of the Minch could\r\nclimb that precipitous barricade. They were necessarily deflected, one\r\nportion creeping to north-east and another to south-west, but both\r\nhugging the great wall of rock all the way. We see precisely the same\r\nresult taking place in the bed of every stream. Let us stand upon an\r\nalmost submerged boulder, and note how the water is deflected to right\r\nand left, and we shall observe at the same time that the boulder, by\r\nobstructing the current, forces the water downwards upon the bed of the\r\nstream, the result being that a hollow is dug out in front. Now, in a\r\nsimilar manner, the ice, squeezed and pressed against the Hebridean\r\nridge by the steady flow of the great current that crossed the Minch,\r\nnecessarily acted with intense erosive force upon its bed. Hence in the\r\ncourse of time it scooped out a series of broad deep trenches along the\r\nwhole inner margin of the Long Island, the amount of the excavation\r\nreaching from 200 to 300 feet. Similar excavated basins occur in like\r\npositions opposite all the precipitous islands of the Inner Hebrides.\r\nWherever, indeed, the ice-sheet met with any great obstruction to\r\nits flow, there excessive erosion took place, and a more or less\r\ndeep hollow was dug out in front of the opposing cliff, or crag,\r\nor precipitous mountain. While, therefore, the upper strata of the\r\nice-sheet overflowed the Outer Hebrides from south-east to north-west,\r\nthe under portions of the same great ice-flow were compelled by the\r\ncontour of the ground to creep away to north-east and south-west, until\r\nthey could steal round the ridge and so escape outwards to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, we have a very simple and obvious explanation of\r\nthe absence of Skye rocks in the till of the Long Island. One sees\r\nreadily enough that the sub-glacial débris dragged across the Minch\r\nwould naturally be carried away to south-west and north-east by the\r\n\"under-tow\" or deflected ice. It is quite impossible that any Skye\r\nfragments or bits of rock from the mainland could travel over the bed\r\nof the Minch, and then be pushed up the precipitous rock wall of the\r\nLong Island. There is only one place in all the Outer Hebrides where\r\nwe might expect to meet with extraneous boulders in the till, and\r\nthat is in the north of Lewis, where the land shelves gently into the\r\nsea, and the great rocky ridge terminates. Here the under-strata of\r\nthe ice would begin to steal up upon the land, favoured by its gentle\r\ninclination, and in that very place accordingly we meet with a deposit\r\nof till in which are found many boulders of a hard red sandstone, and\r\nsome of various porphyries which are quite alien to the Long Island.\r\nMoreover, the till itself in that locality is much more of a clay than\r\nthe usual sub-glacial débris in other parts of Lewis, and contains\r\nnumerous fragments of sea-shells. All this is quite in keeping with the\r\nother evidence. The extreme north end of Lewis was overflowed by the\r\nunder-current that crept up the bed of the Minch, hugging the Hebridean\r\nridge, and dragging along with it a muddy mass interspersed with the\r\nshells and other marine exuviæ that lay in its path, and numerous\r\nstones, some of which may have come from Skye, while others were\r\nderived from the mainland.\r\n\r\nI have already said enough, perhaps, about the abrasion of the\r\nHebrides, but I may add a few words upon the origin of the freshwater\r\nlakes. Many of these rest in complete rock-basins; others, again, seem\r\nto lie partly upon solid rock and partly upon till; while yet others\r\nappear to occupy mere shallow depressions in the surface of the till.\r\nAll of them thus owe their origin to the action of the ice-sheet. As\r\none might have expected, the great majority lie along the outcrop of\r\nthe gneissic strata, which, as a rule, corresponds pretty closely to\r\nthe flow of the ice. Hence the general trend of the lakes is from\r\nsouth-east to north-west. In many cases in fashioning these rock-basins\r\nthe ice has merely deepened in an irregular manner previously existing\r\nhollows, which are now, of course, filled with water. In not a few\r\nplaces, however, the lakes are drawn out in other directions--this\r\nbeing due usually to changes in the strike or outcrop of the strata.\r\nFor example, over a considerable district in the south of Lewis many\r\nlake-hollows extend from south-west to north-east, or at right angles\r\nto the direction of the ice-flow. Such lakes are usually dammed up at\r\none or both extremities by glacial débris.\r\n\r\nThus most of the features characteristic of the Outer Hebrides owe\r\ntheir origin directly or indirectly to the action of that great sheet\r\nof ice which swept over the islands during what is called the Glacial\r\nPeriod. And there is no region in northern Europe where the immensity\r\nof the abrading agent can be more vividly realised. From a study of\r\nthe phenomena there exhibited we for the first time obtain a definite\r\nidea of the surface-slope, and are able to plumb the old ice-sheet, and\r\nascertain with some approach to accuracy its exact thickness. In the\r\ndeeper parts of the area, between the mainland and the Long Island, its\r\nthickness was not less than 3800 feet. Of course this great depth of\r\nice could not have been derived exclusively from the snow that fell on\r\nthe mountains of the north-west Highlands. Doubtless the precipitation\r\ntook place over its whole surface, just as is the case in Greenland and\r\nover the Antarctic continent. The winter cold must have been excessive,\r\nbut the precipitation necessary to sustain such a mass of ice implies\r\ngreat evaporation; in other words, the direct heat of the sun _per\r\ndiem_ in summer-time was probably considerably in excess of what it is\r\nnow in these latitudes. The west and south-west winds must have been\r\nladen with moisture, the greater portion of which would necessarily\r\nfall in the form of snow. We see something analogous to this taking\r\nplace in the Antarctic regions at the present day. That quarter of the\r\nglobe has its summer in perihelion, and, therefore, must be receiving\r\nthen more heat _per diem_ than our hemisphere does in its summer\r\nseason, which, as every one knows, happens when the earth is furthest\r\nremoved from the sun. But, notwithstanding this, the summer of the\r\nAntarctic continent is cold and ungenial--the presence of the great\r\nice-sheet there cooling the air and causing most of the moisture to\r\nfall as snow. Paradoxical as it may seem, therefore great summer heat\r\nis almost, if not quite, as necessary as excessive winter cold for the\r\nproduction and maintenance of a wide continental glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWhen we last took a peep at the Outer Hebrides we found those luckless\r\nislands all but obliterated under an immense sheet of ice extending\r\nfrom the mainland out into the Atlantic. How far west the great glacier\r\nspread itself we cannot as yet positively say; but if the known slope\r\nof its surface between the north-west Highlands and the Long Island\r\ncontinued, as there is every reason to believe it would, then it is\r\nextremely probable that the ice flowed out to the edge of the great\r\nScottish submarine plateau. Here the sudden deepening of the Atlantic\r\nwould arrest its progress and cause it to break up into icebergs. In\r\nthose old times, therefore, a steep wall of ice would extend all along\r\nthe line of what is now the edge of the 100-fathoms plateau. From this\r\nwall large tabular masses would ever and anon break away and float off\r\ninto the Atlantic--a condition of things which is closely paralleled at\r\npresent along the borders of the ice-drowned Antarctic continent.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, however, a great change took place, and the big ice-sheet\r\nmelted off the Long Island and vanished from the Minch. We read the\r\nevidence for this change of climate in certain interesting deposits\r\nwhich occur in considerable bulk at the northern extremity of Lewis,\r\nand in smaller patches in the Eye peninsula of the same island. In\r\nthose districts the old sub-glacial débris or till is covered with\r\nbeds of clay and sand in which many marine exuviæ are found--shells of\r\nmolluscs, entomostraca, foraminifera, etc. They clearly prove, then,\r\nthat after the ice-sheet had vanished Lewis was submerged in the sea\r\nto a depth of not less than 200 feet, and they also prove that the\r\ntemperature of the sea was much the same then as now, for the shells\r\nall belong to species that are still living in these northern waters.\r\nIt is very remarkable that the marine deposits in question seem to\r\noccur nowhere else in any part of the Long Island. We cannot believe\r\nthat the submergence was restricted to the very limited areas where\r\nthe shell-beds are met with: it must, on the contrary, have affected\r\na very large portion, if not the whole, of the Outer Hebrides. Why,\r\nthen, do not we meet with shelly sands and clays, with raised beaches\r\nand other relics of the former occupation of these islands by the sea,\r\ncovering wide areas in the low-grounds? How can we explain the absence\r\nof such relics from all those districts which, being much under the\r\nlevel of 200 feet, must necessarily have at one time formed part of the\r\nsea-floor? The explanation is not difficult to discover.\r\n\r\nResting upon the surface of the shell-beds at Ness and Garabost we\r\nfind an upper or overlying accumulation of sub-glacial débris or till.\r\nAt Ness this upper till closely resembles, in general appearance, the\r\nlower deposit that rests directly upon the rocks. It is a pell-mell\r\naccumulation of silty clay, crammed with glaciated stones, amongst\r\nwhich are many fragments of red sandstone and some extra-Hebridean\r\nrocks, and interspersed through it occur also broken fragments of\r\nsea-shells. The marine deposits lying below are usually much confused\r\nand contorted, and here and there they are even violently commingled\r\nwith the upper till. They show, generally, a most irregular surface\r\nunder that accumulation, and are evidently only the wreck of what they\r\nmust at one time have been. Now the presence of this upper till proves\r\nbeyond doubt that the intense arctic conditions of climate once more\r\nsupervened. A big ice-sheet again filled up the basin of the Minch and\r\nflowed over the Long Island--its under-tow creeping along the inner\r\nmargin of the lofty rock-barrier as before, and eventually stealing\r\nover the low-ground at the Butt, where its bottom-moraine or till was\r\ndragged over the marine deposits, and confusedly commingled with them.\r\nThe upper strata of the ice that streamed across the islands renewed\r\nthe work of abrasion, and succeeded in scraping away all traces of the\r\nlate occupation by the sea. If any such now exist they must lie buried\r\nunder the till that cloaks the low-ground on the western margins of\r\nthe islands. Hence it is that we find not a vestige of shelly beds in\r\nany part of the Long Island which was exposed to the full brunt of\r\nthe ice-flow. At Garabost they have been ploughed through in the most\r\nwonderful manner, and only little patches remain. At Ness, however,\r\nthey are more continuous. This is owing to the circumstance that the\r\nground in that neighbourhood is low-lying and offered no obstacle\r\nto the passage of the ice out to sea. Hence the shell-beds were not\r\nsubjected to such excessive erosion as overtook them along the whole\r\neastern border of the Long Island.\r\n\r\nEventually, however, this later advance of the ice-sheet ceased. The\r\nclimate grew less arctic, and the great glacier began to melt away,\r\nuntil the time came that its upper strata ceased to overflow the\r\nislands. They then passed away to north and south, along the hollow\r\nnow occupied by the Minch, following the same path as the bottom-ice.\r\nConsiderable snow-fields, however, still covered the Outer Hebrides,\r\nand large local glaciers occupied all the mountain-valleys, and,\r\ndescending to low levels, piled up their terminal moraines. Some of\r\nthese local glaciers appear to have gone right out into the Minch,\r\nas in South Uist, and may have coalesced with the great glacier that\r\nstill filled that basin. It was during this condition of things that\r\nmost of the great perched blocks that are scattered so profusely over\r\nthe islands began to be dropt into their present positions. During\r\nthe climax of glacial cold, when the upper strata of the ice-sheet\r\nstreamed across the Hebrides, large fragments of rock would certainly\r\nbe wrenched off and carried on underneath the ice; but as only a few of\r\nthe Hebridean mountain-tops were then exposed, there would be a general\r\nabsence of such enormous erratics as are detached by frost and rolled\r\ndown upon the surface of a glacier, and any such superficially-borne\r\nerratics would be transported, of course, far beyond the Long Island\r\ninto the Atlantic. When the ice had ceased to overflow the islands,\r\nboulders derived from Skye and the mainland would no longer be carried\r\nso directly out to the Atlantic, but would travel thither by the more\r\ncircuitous route, which the now diminished ice-sheet was compelled to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nAs the snow and ice melted off the Hebrides, the rocks would begin\r\nto be exposed to the action of intense frost, and many fragments,\r\nbecoming dislodged and falling upon _névé_, small local ice-sheets,\r\nand glaciers, would be stranded on hill-slopes and sprinkled over the\r\nlow-grounds, along with much broken débris and rock-rubbish. Eventually\r\nall the lower-grounds would be deserted by the ice, glaciers would die\r\nout of the less elevated valleys, and linger in only a few of the glens\r\nthat drain the higher mountain-masses. Such local glaciers have flowed\r\noften at right angles to the direction followed by the great ice-sheet.\r\nThus, the ice-markings in the glens that come down from the Forest\r\nof Harris to West Loch Tarbert, run from north to south, while the\r\ntrend of the older glaciation on the intervening high-grounds is from\r\nsouth-east to north-west.\r\n\r\nThe morainic rubbish and erratics of this latest phase in the glacial\r\nhistory of the Long Island may be traced down almost to the water's\r\nedge, showing plainly that there has been no great submergence of that\r\nregion since the disappearance of glacial conditions. This is somewhat\r\nremarkable, because along the shores of central and southern Scotland\r\nwe have indisputable evidence to show that the land was drowned to\r\nthe depth of at least fifty feet in post-glacial times. In the Outer\r\nHebrides, however, there are no traces of any post-glacial submergence\r\nexceeding a dozen feet or so; that is to say, there is no proof that\r\nthe Outer Hebrides have been of much less extent than they are now. On\r\nthe contrary, we have many reasons for believing that they were within\r\ncomparatively recent times of considerably larger size, and were even\r\nin all probability united to the mainland. The abundance of large\r\ntrees in the peat-mosses, and the fact that these ancient peat-covered\r\nforests extend out to sea, are alone sufficient to convince one that\r\nthe Outer Hebrides have been much reduced in area since the close of\r\nthe glacial period. These now bleak islands at one time supported\r\nextensive forests, although nowadays a tree will hardly grow unless\r\nit be carefully looked after. That old forest period coincided in\r\nall probability with the latest continental condition of the British\r\nIslands--when the broad plains which are now drowned under the German\r\nOcean formed part of a great forest-land, that included all the\r\nBritish Islands, and extended west for some distance into tracts over\r\nwhich now roll the waves of the Atlantic. The palmy days of the great\r\nBritish forests, however, passed away when the German Ocean came into\r\nexistence. The climatic conditions were then not so favourable for the\r\ngrowth of large trees; and in the uplands of our country, and what are\r\nnow our maritime districts, the forests decayed, and were gradually\r\novergrown by and buried under peat-mosses. The submergence of the land\r\ncontinued after that, until central and southern Scotland were reduced\r\nto a considerably smaller size than now, and then by-and-by the process\r\nwas reversed, and the sea once more retreated, leaving behind it a\r\nnumber of old raised beaches to mark the levels at which it formerly\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nThe greatest submergence that overtook central and southern Scotland\r\nin times posterior to the latest continental condition of Britain did\r\nnot exceed fifty feet, or thereabout; and the extreme limits reached by\r\nthe sea in the period that supervened between the close of the glacial\r\nepoch and the \"age of forests\" was not more than one hundred feet. The\r\nOuter Hebrides, however, were certainly not smaller in post-glacial\r\ntimes than they are now, and we have no evidence to show that after the\r\n\"age of forests\" had passed away the sea rose higher than a dozen feet\r\nor so above its present level. Now there are only two ways in which all\r\nthis can be accounted for. Either the Hebrides remained stationary, or\r\nstood at a level higher than now, while the central and southern parts\r\nof Scotland were being submerged; or else there has been a very recent\r\ndepression within the Hebridean area, which has carried down below the\r\nsea all traces of late glacial and post-glacial raised beaches. All we\r\nknow for certain is, that the only raised beaches in the Long Island\r\nare met with in low maritime regions at only a few feet above the\r\npresent high-water mark. My own impression is that the whole district\r\nhas been submerged within comparatively recent times; for if the\r\npresent coast-line had endured since the close of the glacial period,\r\nor even since the last continental condition of Britain, I should have\r\nexpected the sea to have done more than it has in the way of excavation\r\nand erosion.\r\n\r\nIn a former article I have spoken of the sand-dunes and sandy flats\r\nof the west coast of the Long Island. These receive their greatest\r\ndevelopment in North Uist, Benbecula, and South Uist. Along the whole\r\nwestern margin of these islands stretch wide shoals and banks of\r\nyellow sand and silt, and similar shoals and banks cover the bed of\r\nthe shallow sounds or channels. In the middle of the Sound of Harris\r\none may often touch the bottom with an oar, and even run one's boat\r\naground. It is the same in the Sound of Barra, while, as I have already\r\nmentioned, one may walk at low-water from Benbecula into the adjacent\r\nislands of North and South Uist. Where does all this sand come from?\r\nCertainly not from the degradation of the islands by the sea, for the\r\nsounds appear to be silting up, and the general appearance of the sandy\r\nflats along the west coast indicates that the land is upon the whole\r\ngaining rather than losing. I have no doubt at all that this sand and\r\nsilt are merely the old sub-glacial débris which the ice-sheet spread\r\nover the low shelving plateau that extends west under the Atlantic to\r\nthe 100-fathoms line. That plateau must have been thickly covered with\r\ntill, and with heaps and sheets of gravel and sand and silt, and it is\r\nthese deposits, sifted and winnowed by the sea, which the tides and\r\nwaves sweep up along the Atlantic margin of the islands.\r\n\r\nThere are many other points of interest to that I might touch upon,\r\nbut I have said enough perhaps to indicate to any intelligent observer\r\nthe kind of country he may be led to expect in the Long Island. Of\r\ncourse the history of the glacial period is very well illustrated\r\nin many parts of the mainland, which are much easier of access than\r\nthe Outer Hebrides. But these islands contain, at least, one bit of\r\nevidence which does not occur anywhere else in Britain. In them we\r\nobtain, for the first time, data for measuring the actual slope of the\r\nice-sheet. It does not follow, however, that the inclination of the\r\nsurface towards the Atlantic was the same all over the area covered\r\nby the ice-sheet. The slope of the sheet that flowed east into the\r\nbasin of the German Ocean, for example, may have been, and probably\r\nwas, less than that of the Hebridean ice-flow. But apart altogether\r\nfrom this particular point, I think there is no part of the British\r\nIslands where the evidence for the former action of a great ice-sheet\r\nis more abundant and more easily read, or where one may realise with\r\nsuch vividness the conditions that obtained during that period of\r\nextraordinary climatic vicissitudes, which geologists call the Glacial\r\nEpoch.\r\n\r\nLeaving these old arctic scenes, and coming down to the actual present,\r\nno one, I think, can wander much about the Outer Hebrides without\r\npondering over the fate of the islanders themselves. Many writers\r\nhave asserted that the Celt of these rather out-of-the-way places\r\nis a lazy, worthless creature, whom we Saxons should do our best to\r\nweed out. One cannot help feeling that this assertion is unfair and\r\ncruel. The fact is, we judge him by a wrong standard. He is by nature\r\nand long-inherited habits a fisherman, and has been wont to cultivate\r\nonly so much land as should suffice for the sustenance of himself and\r\nthose immediately dependent upon him. In old times he was often enough\r\ncalled upon to fight, wrongly or rightly, and thus acquired that proud\r\nbearing which it has taken so many long years of misery to crush out.\r\nHe is, as a rule, totally unfit for the close confinement and hard work\r\nwhich are the lot of the great mass of our mechanics--does not see the\r\nbeauty of that, and has rather a kind of contempt for the monotonous\r\ndrudgery of large manufacturing towns. One of the few situations in\r\ntown that he cares to fill is that of police-constable. Give him a\r\nlife in the open air, however trying it may be, and he will be quite\r\ncontent if he can make enough to feed himself and family. If the\r\nfishing chance to be very profitable he does not, as a rule, think of\r\nsaving the surplus he has made, but looks forward rather to a spell of\r\nidleness, when he can smoke his pipe and talk interminable long talks\r\nwith his neighbours. No doubt this, judged by our own standard, is all\r\nvery shocking. Why doesn't he put his money in the savings-bank, and\r\nby-and-by die and leave it to those who come after him? Simply because\r\nhe is a Celt, and not a Saxon.\r\n\r\nOf course one knows how it will all end. Ere long the unadulterated\r\nCelt will be driven or improved out of these islands, and will retire\r\nto other lands, where, mingling and intermarrying with Teutons, he\r\nwill eventually disappear, but not without leavening the races amongst\r\nwhich he is destined to vanish. And who will take his place in the\r\nLong Island? Probably a few farmers, a few shepherds, and a sprinkling\r\nof gamekeepers; and it is just possible that a few fishermen also may\r\nbe allowed to settle down here and there upon the coast. One may see\r\nthe process going on at present. Large tracts that once supported many\r\nvillages are now quite depopulated. The time will come when somebody in\r\nParliament will move for the reduction of the Civil Service estimates\r\nby the amount of the sheriff-substitute's salary, and when the jail at\r\nLochmaddy will have nothing higher in the scale of being to imprison\r\nthan some refractory ram. One may be pardoned for wishing that he could\r\nforetell for the islands another fate than this. It is sad to think\r\nthat a fine race of people is thus surely passing away from amongst\r\nus, for, despite all that can be urged against them, they are what I\r\nsay. The fishermen of Lewis and Barra are bold, stalwart fellows, whom\r\nit would be difficult to peer amongst any similar class of men on the\r\nmainland. And all through the island one meets with equally excellent\r\nspecimens of our kind. Many a brave soldier who fought our battles in\r\nthe great French wars hailed from these outer islands. Pity it is that\r\nno feasible plan to prevent the threatened scattering of the race has\r\nyet been brought forward. Some day we may regret this, and come to\r\nthink that though mutton and wool in the Long Island are desirable, yet\r\nislanders would have been better.\r\n\r\n  [Postscript.--On pages 153.4 I have described the second general\r\n  ice-sheet that overflowed the Outer Hebrides as having eventually\r\n  become resolved into a series of local ice-sheets and glaciers.\r\n  Subsequent research, however, has since led me to believe that the\r\n  district ice-sheets and local glaciers referred to were not the\r\n  direct descendants of the last great ice-sheet. They appear to\r\n  have come into existence long after that ice-sheet had entirely\r\n  disappeared. _See_ Article X.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThe Ice Age in Europe and North America.[K]\r\n\r\n[K] Address to the Geological Society of Edinburgh, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn casting about for a subject upon which to address you this evening,\r\nI thought I could hardly do better than give you the result of a\r\ncomparison which I have recently been able to make between the glacial\r\nphenomena of Europe and North America. The subject of glaciation seems\r\nto be now somewhat worn; but I gather from the fact that writers can\r\nstill be found who see in our superficial deposits strong evidence of\r\nthe Deluge, that a short outline of what we really do know may not be\r\nunacceptable. In the short time at our disposal, it is obvious that\r\nI cannot enter into much detail, and that many interesting questions\r\nmust remain untouched. It will be as well, therefore, that I should at\r\nthe outset define the limits of the present inquiry, and state clearly\r\nwhat are the chief points to which I wish to direct your attention. My\r\nmain object, then, will be to bring into prominence such evidence as\r\nseems to betoken in a special manner the uniformity of conditions that\r\nobtained in the northern hemisphere during the Ice Age. In other words,\r\nI shall confine myself to a description of certain characteristic and\r\nrepresentative phenomena which are common to Europe and North America,\r\nwith the view of showing that the physical conditions of the glacial\r\nperiod were practically the same in both continents.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which might be considered under this head embrace nearly\r\nall the facts with which glacialists are familiar, but I purpose\r\nrestricting myself to three questions only, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1st. _The extent of glaciation._\r\n  2nd. _Changes of climate during the Ice Age._\r\n  3rd. _The results of fluvio-glacial action._\r\n\r\nThe consideration of these questions, even if it were exhaustive\r\n(which it cannot be on this occasion), would still leave the general\r\nsubject very incomplete, for we must forego the discussion of all\r\nsuch interesting topics as the \"connection between glaciation and\r\nsubmergence,\" \"the formation of rock-basins,\" and the \"origin of the\r\ngeographical distribution of our faunas and floras.\" Confining my\r\ninquiry within the limits just specified, I shall begin by sketching\r\nbroadly the general results obtained by glacialists in Europe, and\r\nthereafter I shall proceed to give an outline of the corresponding\r\nconclusions arrived at by American observers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_The Extent of Glaciation in Europe._\r\n\r\nTo what extent, then, let us ask, has Europe been glaciated? What areas\r\nhave been covered with perennial snow and ice? Owing to the fulness and\r\nclearness of the evidence, we are able to give a very definite answer\r\nto this question. It is hardly too much to say that we are as well\r\nacquainted with the distribution of glacier-ice in Europe during the\r\nIce Age as we are with that of existing snow-fields and glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the evidence upon which our knowledge is based\r\nis doubtless familiar to many whom I have the pleasure of now\r\naddressing, but for the sake of those who have not such familiarity\r\nwith the subject I may be allowed to indicate very briefly its\r\ngeneral character. A rock-surface over which ice has flowed for any\r\nconsiderable time exhibits either an abraded, worn, and smoothed\r\nappearance, or the rocks are disrupted and broken, and larger or\r\nsmaller fragments are found to have been removed and carried forward\r\nin the direction followed by the ice. Now, ice-worn and shattered\r\nrock-surfaces of this description, such as can be seen underneath\r\nexisting glaciers, occur more or less abundantly over vast regions in\r\nEurope. They are met with from the North Cape south as far as Leipzig,\r\nand from the Outer Hebrides east to the valley of the Petchora and the\r\nfoot-slopes of the Ural Mountains. Nor are they confined to northern\r\nEurope. They appear again and again in France and Spain and Italy,\r\nand in the low-grounds of middle Europe, where they occupy positions\r\nnow far removed from the influence of glacial action. Such ice-worn\r\nand disrupted rock-surfaces not only prove that glacier-ice formerly\r\ncovered large portions of our Continent, but they also indicate for\r\nus the directions in which that enveloping ice moved. The smoother\r\nsurfaces in question are very frequently marked with coarse and fine\r\nparallel scratches and grooves of precisely the same nature and origin\r\nas the scratches and grooves which characterise the rocky bed of a\r\nmodern glacier. And these markings, having been produced by the sand,\r\ngrit, and stones which are pushed and dragged over the rocks by flowing\r\nice, necessarily discover for us the path of glacial movement. But\r\nall rocks subjected to glacial action are not necessarily smoothed\r\nand polished. Sometimes, owing to structural peculiarities, and for\r\nvarious other reasons, rocks cannot resist the pressure of the ice,\r\nbut are crushed and broken, and the resulting fragments are rolled and\r\ndragged forward in the direction of ice-flow. In this manner the path\r\nof a glacier becomes strewed with débris which has from time to time\r\nbeen forced from its rocky bed. There is really no mystery, therefore\r\nin tracking the spoor of extinct glaciers; for we have two sets of\r\nfacts to aid us, either of which might suffice to indicate the extent\r\nand direction of glaciation. Consider, however, for a moment, what one\r\nobserves in connection with rock-striation. We have, in the first\r\nplace, the rounding and smoothing, and the parallel ruts and striæ. Not\r\nonly so, but we frequently find that one side of prominent projecting\r\nknolls and hills is more highly worn and abraded than the other. Often,\r\nindeed, one side may show no trace whatsoever of abrasion. Here, again,\r\nwe have clear evidence of the direction of ice-flow. Who can doubt that\r\nthe worn and abraded rocks look towards the point whence the ice came,\r\nand that the non-glaciated rocks in the rear have been sheltered by the\r\nrocks in front? It is for this reason that in the mountainous regions\r\nof northern Europe the striated and smoothed rock-surfaces invariably\r\nlook up the valleys, while the broken and unworn rock-ledges face in\r\nthe opposite direction.\r\n\r\nOnce more, note the manner in which the sub-glacial rock-rubbish,\r\nconsisting of clay, sand, grit, stones, and boulders, has been amassed.\r\nIn places where the ice must have moved more or less rapidly, as on\r\nconsiderable slopes, no accumulation took place, while in the rear\r\nof projecting crags and knobs of rock, sub-glacial materials often\r\ngathered deeply. Again, over low-lying tracts, where the motion of\r\nthe ice would necessarily be retarded, clay, sand, and stones tended\r\nto collect. And this particularly appears to have been the case in\r\nthose regions where the slow-creeping and gradually thinning ice-sheet\r\napproached its terminal line. Hence it is that we encounter such thick\r\nand wide-spread sheets of sub-glacial detritus upon the undulating\r\nlow-grounds and plains of southern Sweden, Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein,\r\nHolland, northern Germany, Poland, and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe sub-glacial débris to which I specially refer is known as _Till_\r\nor _Boulder-clay_ in this country, as _Krosstenslera_ in Sweden, as\r\n_Geschiebelehm_ or _Geschiebemergel_ in Germany, and as _Grundmoräne_\r\nor _Moraine profonde_ in Switzerland. Its general characters are too\r\nwell known to require more than the briefest summary. In general this\r\npeculiar accumulation is an unstratified clay, containing, scattered\r\nhiggledy-piggledy through it, stones and boulders of all shapes and\r\nsizes. Many of these rock-fragments are smoothed and striated, and\r\neven the smallest particles, when viewed under the microscope, often\r\nshow delicate scratches. Frequently, too, the clay is excessively hard\r\nand tough, and in many places it shows a kind of pseudo-lamination,\r\nwhich is generally more or less crumpled, and often highly involved.\r\nThese appearances prove that the clay has not only been subjected to\r\nintense pressure, but has actually been rolled over upon itself. I\r\nneed only refer to the plentiful occurrence of \"slickensides\" in such\r\nclays--the joints by which the clay is often traversed showing such\r\npolishing clearly on their faces. These, and many other facts which\r\ntime forbids me to mention, have received an explanation which has now\r\nbeen generally adopted by European glacialists. The boulder-clay or\r\ntill is considered by them to represent the ground- or bottom-moraine\r\nof glacier-ice. There used to be a notion prevalent amongst geologists\r\nin our country that this clay was almost peculiar to these islands.\r\nIt occurs, however, in most countries of Europe. Vast regions in the\r\nnorth are more or less continuously covered by it, and we meet with\r\nit abundantly also upon the low-grounds of Switzerland, from which it\r\nmay be followed far down the great valley of the Rhone into the sunny\r\nplains of France. The lower valleys of the Pyrenees and other Spanish\r\nranges show it well, and it is conspicuous likewise in northern Italy,\r\nespecially over the low tracts at the mouths of the great lake-valleys.\r\nIn all those places one can see boulder-clay of as pronounced a\r\ncharacter as any to be met with in Scotland.\r\n\r\nDanish, Dutch, German, and Russian geologists have of late years\r\ndevoted much attention to the study of this clay, which is so\r\nremarkably developed in their respective countries. It has been long\r\nwell known that a large proportion of the stones and boulders contained\r\nin the till are of northern derivation, but it is only of recent years\r\nthat we have ascertained the particular routes by which those wanderers\r\nor erratics have travelled. The rock-fragments in question have been\r\ntracked back, as it were, to their parent masses, and thus, partly\r\nin this way, and partly by the evidence of ice-worn surfaces, we have\r\nbeen enabled to follow the spoor of the great northern ice-sheet in a\r\nmost satisfactory manner. Let one or two examples suffice. Boulders\r\nderived from Lapland and Finland occur in the till at St. Petersburg,\r\nand have been traced south-east to Moscow. Again, fragments carried\r\nfrom Gottland, in the Baltic, are met with in the boulder-clay of east\r\nPrussia, and have been followed south to beyond Berlin. In like manner\r\nboulders of well-known Scanian rocks appear in the boulder-clay of\r\nLeipzig. So also Swedish and Norwegian rock-fragments are seen in the\r\nboulder-clay of Denmark, Hanover, and Holland.\r\n\r\nVery wide areas in northern Germany are covered with an almost\r\ncontinuous sheet of glacial detritus, so that it is only occasionally\r\nthat the underlying rocks crop out at the surface. Striated\r\nrock-surfaces are therefore by no means so commonly exposed as in\r\nregions like the Lowlands of Scotland. They are not wanting, however,\r\nand their evidence is very striking. Thus, in the neighbourhood of\r\nLeipzig and Dresden, we find glacial striæ impressed upon certain\r\nhighly-abraded and ice-worn hillocks of porphyry, the striæ being the\r\nwork of ice which flowed into Saxony from the north. Similar striæ;,\r\nhaving a general southerly trend, occur at Rüdersdorf, near Berlin,\r\nat Gommern, near Magdeburg, at Velpke in Brunswick, at Osnabrück in\r\nHanover, and at other places. Again, we encounter remarkable evidence\r\nof the powerful pressure exerted by the ice in the displacement and\r\nremoval of huge blocks of strata. In Saxony, for example, the Tertiary\r\nstrata are turned up, pushed out of place, and involved in boulder-clay\r\nto such an extent that the brown coals have often been mined for in\r\nthis strange position. Witness also the extensive displacements and\r\ndislocations of the Cretaceous formation in the Danish islands of the\r\nBaltic. So great are the contortions and displacements of the Chalk in\r\nMoen, that these disturbances were formerly attributed to subterranean\r\naction. Along the north-east coast of that island, cliffs 400 feet in\r\nheight exhibit the Cretaceous beds thrown upon end, twisted, bent,\r\nand even inverted, boulder-clay being squeezed into and between the\r\ndisjointed and ruptured rock-masses.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of these and similar phenomena, it has been demonstrated\r\nthat during the climax of the Ice Age a very large part of northern\r\nEurope was buried under a thick covering of glacier-ice. And it has\r\nbeen conclusively shown that this ice-sheet streamed outwards in all\r\ndirections from the high-grounds of Scandinavia, for which reason it is\r\noften spoken of as the Scandinavian ice-sheet. But as it was fed, not\r\nfrom the snow-fields of Scandinavia alone, but from the precipitation\r\nof snow over its whole surface, it is better, I think, to speak of it\r\nas the northern ice-sheet. In the extreme north of Scandinavia the ice\r\nflowed northward into the Arctic Ocean, while south of the dominant\r\nwatershed of Lapland and Sweden its course in those high latitudes was\r\neast and south-east. It filled up the depressions of the White Sea, the\r\nGulf of Bothnia, and the Baltic, extending east to the valley of the\r\nPetchora and the base of the Ural Mountains, and south-east to Kazan,\r\nsome 200 miles east of Nijnii-Novgorod. From this point its terminal\r\nfront trended a little west of south, until it reached the fiftieth\r\nparallel of latitude. Undulating a few miles south and north of this\r\nparallel, it swept directly west through Russia into Galicia, till it\r\ntouched the foot-hills of the Carpathian range. After this we follow it\r\nalong the northern base of the Riesen Gebirge, the Erz Gebirge, and the\r\nHarz, and thence westward through Hanover, and into the Low Countries,\r\nas far south at least as the mouth of the Rhine. Throughout the vast\r\nregions lying west and north of this terminal line, the track followed\r\nby the ice has been well ascertained. It was east and south-east in\r\nRussia, southerly in east Prussia, south-westerly in Denmark, Hanover,\r\nand Holland.\r\n\r\nThe action of a mass of glacier-ice, reaching a thickness of several\r\nthousand feet, must necessarily have resulted in extensive erosion of\r\nthe rocks over which it passed. Everywhere, therefore, throughout the\r\nvast area just indicated, we meet with evidence of severe erosion.\r\nBut, as one should expect, such erosion is most marked in the hilly\r\nregions--in those areas where steep slopes induced more rapid motion of\r\nthe ice, and where projecting crags and hills opposed the advance of\r\nthe eroding agent. All such prominent obstructions were energetically\r\nassailed--abraded, rounded, worn, and smoothed, or crushed, shattered,\r\ndislocated, and displaced. The high-grounds of Scandinavia and Finland,\r\nformed for the most part of tough, crystalline rocks, or of more or\r\nless durable strata, show everywhere _roches moutonnées_--smoothed and\r\nrounded rocks--while innumerable rock-basins have been scooped out in\r\nfront of prominent crags and hills. In Denmark and other countries,\r\nwhere less durable rocks prevail, the strata have often been broken\r\nand disrupted, and pushed out of place. But as regions formed of such\r\nrocks are generally gently-undulating, and seldom show abrupt crags and\r\nhills, they oppose few obstructions to the advance of an ice-sheet.\r\nWhen the northern ice-sheet flowed into Russia and Germany, it crept\r\nover a low-lying and, for the most part, gently-undulating surface;\r\nand although here and there the form of the ground favoured glacial\r\nerosion and disruption, and extensive displacements of rock-masses\r\ntook place, yet, upon the whole the low-lying regions referred to\r\nbecame areas of accumulation. The sub-glacial detritus--ground out\r\nor wrenched away from the rough Scandinavian plateau and the uplands\r\nof Finland--was dragged on underneath the ice, and spread over the\r\ngreat plains lying to the south-east and south, as the gradually\r\nattenuated ice-sheet crawled to its terminal line. My friend Dr. Amund\r\nHelland, the well-known Norwegian geologist, has made an estimate of\r\nthe amount of rock-débris derived from Scandinavia and Finland which\r\nlies scattered over the low-grounds of northern Europe. According to\r\nhim, the area in Denmark, Holland, Germany, and Russia (exclusive of\r\nFinland), over which northern detritus is scattered, contains about\r\n2,100,000 square kilometres, and the average thickness of the deposits\r\nis about 150 feet, of which, however, only two-thirds, or 100 feet, are\r\nof northern origin, the remaining third consisting of local materials.\r\nTaking, then, 100 feet as fairly representing the average thickness\r\nof the rock-rubbish derived from Finland and Scandinavia, the area of\r\nwhich is given as 800,000 square kilometres, there is enough of this\r\nmaterial to raise the general surface of those lands by 255 feet. The\r\nsame amount of material would suffice to fill up all the numerous lakes\r\nof Finland and Sweden sixteen or seventeen times over. Or, if tumbled\r\ninto the Baltic, it would fill the basin of that sea one and a half\r\ntimes. In short, enough northern rock-débris lies upon the low-grounds\r\nof northern Europe, which, were it restored to the countries from which\r\nit has been taken, would obliterate all the lake-hollows of Finland\r\nand Sweden, raise the level of those lands by 80 feet, and fill up the\r\nentire basin of the Baltic, with all its bays. And yet this estimate\r\nleaves out of account all the material which the ice-sheet carried away\r\nfrom Norway and the British Islands.\r\n\r\nOf the glaciation of our own land I need say very little. The\r\nconfiguration of our country necessarily made it a centre of dispersion\r\nduring the Ice Age, and the ice which covered Ireland, Scotland, and\r\nthe major portion of England radiated outwards from the dominant\r\nelevations of the land. But as the ice creeping outwards from those\r\ncentres became confluent, the directions which it followed were often\r\nconsiderably modified, especially upon the low-grounds. We know that\r\nthe British ice-sheet not only covered the land up to near the tops of\r\nour higher mountains, but filled up all our seas and extended into the\r\nAtlantic beyond the coasts of Ireland and the Outer Hebrides--these\r\nlatter islands having been glaciated from the east by the ice that\r\nflowed outwards from the mainland. Another point upon which we are now\r\nwell assured is the fact that the British and Scandinavian ice-sheets\r\ncoalesced, so that the basin of the North Sea completely brimmed over\r\nwith glacier-ice.\r\n\r\nFinally, then, in contemplating the physical conditions that obtained\r\nin northern Europe at the climax of the Ice Age, we have to picture to\r\nourselves the almost total obliteration under a vast ice-sheet of all\r\nthe land-features of the British Islands, Scandinavia, and Finland, and\r\nthe adjacent low-lying tracts of Denmark, Holland, Germany, Poland, and\r\nRussia. If at that distant date a prehistoric man could have stood on\r\nthe summit of Snaehatten, he would have seen an apparently interminable\r\nplain of snow and ice, bounded only by the visible horizon. Could\r\nhe have followed the plain southwards in hopes of escaping from it,\r\nhe would have descended its gently-sloping surface by imperceptible\r\ngradations for a distance of 700 miles, before he reached its\r\ntermination at the foot of the mountains of middle Germany. Or, could\r\nhe have set out upon an easterly course, he would have crossed the Gulf\r\nof Bothnia, buried several thousand feet beneath him, and touched the\r\nfoot-slopes of the Ural Mountains before he gained the terminal front\r\nof the ice-cap, a distance of 1600 miles. On the other hand, had he\r\nwalked south-west in the direction of Ireland, he would have traversed\r\nthe area of the North Sea at a height of several thousand feet above\r\nits bed, and, crossing the British area, would only have reached the\r\nice-front at a point some 50 miles beyond the coast of Ireland. Here he\r\nwould have seen the ice-sheet presenting a steep face to the assaults\r\nof the Atlantic, and breaking away in massive tabular bergs, like those\r\nwhich are calved by the ice-cap of the Antarctic regions.\r\n\r\nI must now pass rapidly in review the facts relating to the glaciation\r\nof the mountainous regions which lay outside of the area covered by\r\nthe northern ice-sheet. The glaciers of the Alps of Switzerland, about\r\nwhich so much has been written, and the study of which first gave\r\nVenetz, Charpentier, and Agassiz the clue to the meaning of striated\r\nrocks, boulder-clay, and erratics, are, as is well known, the puny\r\ndescendants of former gigantic ice-flows. At the culmination of the Ice\r\nAge all the mountain-valleys of Switzerland and northern Italy were\r\nchoked with glaciers that streamed out upon the low-grounds. Along\r\nthe northern slopes of the Alps, as in Bavaria and Würtemberg, these\r\nglaciers coalesced to form a considerable ice-sheet, and so likewise\r\ndid the glaciers that descended from Switzerland, Savoy, and Dauphiny,\r\ninto the great valley of the Rhone. Even in north Italy the same was\r\nthe case with the glaciers that occupied the valleys in which now lie\r\nLakes Orta, Maggiore, Varese, Lugano, and Como--the united ice-flows of\r\nthose valleys forming a glacier which deployed upon the plains of the\r\nPo, with a frontage of not less than 40 miles.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Alps, the Vosges Mountains and the Black Forest,\r\nthe Harz, the Erz Gebirge, the Riesen Gebirge, and the Böhmer-Wald--all\r\nhad their perennial ice and glaciers, although none of those elevated\r\ntracts now reaches the snow-line. It was the same with the Carpathians\r\nand the Urals, amongst which we meet with relics of much larger\r\nice-streams than any that now exist in the Alps. Considerably further\r\nsouth were the glaciers of the Despoto Dagh of Roumelia. Great glaciers\r\nalso in former times descended from the Caucasus, and in many hilly\r\nregions of Asia Minor indubitable traces of similar large ice-flows\r\nhave been detected. The high-grounds of central France, and the\r\nmountains of Beaujolais and Lyonnais supported considerable glaciers,\r\nwhile from the Pyrenees numerous glaciers of the first class flowed out\r\nupon the low-grounds of France, and considerable ice-streams occupied\r\nthe mountain-valleys on the Spanish side. Other Peninsular chains--the\r\nSerra da Estrella, the Sierra Guadarama, and the Sierra Nevada--had\r\nlikewise their snow-fields and ice-streams. The same was the case\r\nwith the Apennines and the Apuan Alps of Italy, the traces of former\r\nglacial action being conspicuous over a considerable part of Tuscany.\r\nEven in Corsica we encounter the same evidence of glaciation--striated\r\nrock-surfaces and moraines--which point to the former descent of\r\nconsiderable glaciers from Monte Rotondo.\r\n\r\nBut rock-striæ and moraines are not the only proofs of former cold and\r\nhumid conditions having prevailed over middle and southern Europe at\r\nthe climax of the glacial period. The limestone-breccias of Gibraltar\r\nhave been described by Professor Ramsay and myself, and we have shown\r\nthat these could only have been formed under the influence of excessive\r\nfrost and melting snows. The limestone of the Rock has been broken up\r\nalong the ridge, and its fragments showered down the slopes, at a time\r\nwhen these were more or less thickly covered with snow. Resting upon\r\nand imbedded in this snow, the rock-rubbish would be carried downward\r\nand outward during the gradual melting that took place in summer. And\r\nin this way immense accumulations of débris were borne forwards over\r\nthe low-grounds that extended from the base of the Rock into regions\r\nwhich are now partially submerged. Breccias which have probably had a\r\nsimilar origin occur also in Corsica, Malta, and Cyprus, and doubtless\r\nthey will yet be recognised in many other places. Again, over wide\r\nareas in northern France and the south of England, we meet with\r\nextensive sheets of earthy clay and rock-rubbish, which have certainly\r\nbeen heaped up under very different conditions of climate than obtain\r\nnow. This stony earth has evidently travelled down the gentle slopes\r\nof the land, under the influence of frost and melting snow, in much\r\nthe same way as ice-driven rock-rubbish and soil move slowly down the\r\nslopes of such dreary regions as Patagonia and certain low-lying tracts\r\nwithin the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Changes of Climate in Europe during the Ice Age._\r\n\r\nWe come next to the very interesting question of alternations\r\nof climate during the Ice Age. The evidence under this head has\r\naccumulated to such an extent within recent years as to convince most\r\nstudents of Pleistocene geology that very extensive changes of climate\r\ncharacterised the glacial period. How many such changes took place we\r\nare not yet in a position to say, but we know that the intensely arctic\r\ncondition of things which has just been described was interrupted more\r\nthan once by what have been termed \"interglacial epochs,\" during which\r\na mild and genial climate prevailed over middle and northern Europe.\r\nFor some time it was believed that such \"interglacial epochs\" had only\r\na local significance, that they bespoke mere transitory retreats of the\r\nice-fields, such as are known to have taken place within historical\r\ntimes in the glacier-valleys of the Alps. But increased observation\r\nand reflection have shown that this explanation of the phenomena of\r\n\"interglacial beds\" will not suffice. It is impossible to enter here\r\nupon details, but I may briefly state that the evidence in question\r\nis two-fold. _First_, we have the stratigraphical evidence. We have\r\nascertained the existence, over wide areas in this and other glaciated\r\ncountries, of several successive sheets of boulder-clay, which are\r\noften separated from each other by fossiliferous aqueous strata. It has\r\nbeen demonstrated that each of these sheets of sub-glacial detritus\r\nis the accumulation of a separate and distinct ice-flow. _Second_, we\r\nhave the evidence of fossil organic remains. We find, for example, that\r\nthe flora which covered the low-grounds of middle and temperate Europe\r\nduring a certain stage of the glacial or Pleistocene period, consisted\r\nof plants which are now restricted to the tops of our mountains and to\r\nnorthern Scandinavia. The characteristic fauna associated with that\r\nflora embraced the reindeer, glutton, mammoth, woolly rhinoceros,\r\nArctic fox lemming, chamois, and so forth. We know, indeed, that man\r\nhunted the reindeer and the mammoth in the south of France. Similar\r\ntestimony to the coldness and humidity of the climate is borne by the\r\nland- and freshwater shells which occur in certain Pleistocene deposits\r\nin Italy, Corsica, southern France, Switzerland, Germany, etc. That\r\nthis flora and fauna were contemporaneous with the great glaciation of\r\nour Continent has been as well ascertained as the fact of the Roman\r\noccupation of Britain. But if the evidence of organic remains strongly\r\nconfirms and supports that supplied by the distribution of glacial\r\ndeposits in Europe, no less forcibly does it corroborate the physical\r\nevidence as to the former existence of a warm and genial interglacial\r\nclimate. During interglacial times a most abundant mammalian fauna\r\nroamed over all temperate Europe--a fauna comprising such animals as\r\nIrish deer, urus, bison, horse, stag, saiga, brown bear, grisly bear,\r\nseveral species of elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus, hyæna,\r\nlion, leopard, etc. A like tale of genial conditions is told by the\r\nland- and freshwater shells, which occur in some of the Pleistocene\r\ndeposits of England, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and\r\nItaly. The testimony of the associated flora is just as striking. How\r\ngenial and equable must have been the climate which permitted plants\r\nlike the Canary laurel, the Judas-tree, the fig-tree, and others to\r\nflourish side by side in the north of France, with such forms as the\r\nhazel, willow, ash, and sycamore! The most noteworthy additions to our\r\nknowledge of interglacial conditions which have recently been made\r\nare the results obtained by M. Gaudry in the valley of the Seine, and\r\nby Dr. Penck in Bavarian Tyrol, the latter of whom has shown that\r\nthere have been at least three great advances of the Alpine glaciers,\r\nseparated by long-continued mild conditions, during which the glaciers\r\nreceded far into the mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that we have, especially in our own\r\nislands, good evidence to show that during the glacial period\r\nconsiderable oscillations of the relative level of land and sea took\r\nplace. Thus, it has been ascertained, that just before the latest epoch\r\nof extensive glaciation, the British Islands were largely submerged\r\nin the sea. To what depth this remarkable submergence was carried\r\nwe do not know, because any marine deposits which may have been\r\naccumulated at that time over the drowned country were for the most\r\npart obliterated by the action of the ice-sheet which subsequently\r\ncovered and reglaciated our lands.[L] But the few fragments of such\r\nmarine deposits as have been preserved show us that the depression\r\nreached more than 500 feet in Scotland (_i.e._, measured from the\r\npresent sea-level), and exceeding 1000 feet in Wales and Ireland. We\r\nnote, then, in passing, that the only great Pleistocene submergence of\r\nthese lands of which geologists have any knowledge took place before\r\nthe appearance of the last general ice-sheet that overflowed our\r\nlow-grounds. The submergences of a later date were of inconsiderable\r\nimportance, hardly exceeding 100 feet or thereabouts below the present\r\nsea-level. The latest occupant of our islands and of northern Europe\r\nwas not the sea, but ice. The \"Palæocrystic Sea,\" which we have been\r\nrecently assured would account for our glacial phenomena, is of\r\n\"the stuff that dreams are made of.\" There is not a jot or tittle\r\nof evidence for the former existence of such a sea over any part of\r\nBritain or the continent of Europe.\r\n\r\n[L] I no longer believe in this \"great submergence.\" The marine shells\r\nin the high-level drift-deposits of our islands are \"erratics,\" carried\r\nby the ice-sheet which occupied the basin of the Irish Sea. That the\r\nlow-grounds were submerged but the amount of the submergence has not\r\nbeen ascertained; probably it did not exceed a few hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for my present purpose to enter further into the\r\nevidence of interglacial conditions. The latest northern ice-sheet was\r\npreceded by a long epoch of mild and genial conditions, during which\r\nelephants and hippopotami ranged north as far at least as Yorkshire;\r\nwhile middle Germany, as we know from the testimony of its interglacial\r\ndeposits, enjoyed a similar delightful climate. And yet the immediately\r\npreceding glacial epoch had seen all those fertile regions covered\r\nwith an ice-sheet that extended south as far as the fiftieth parallel\r\nof latitude. Now the question with which I am at present concerned\r\nis the extent of the latest general glaciation. Did the last great\r\nice-sheet reach as far south as its predecessor? It certainly did not.\r\nIts bottom-moraine has now been mapped out and distinguished from that\r\nof the older ice-sheet, and we know that it does not extend so far\r\nsouth as the latter. It is entirely absent over all the region to the\r\nwest of the River Elbe, from near Dresden to Hamburg and the coast of\r\nHolland.[M] So that western Germany and Holland, which were covered\r\nby ice during the epoch of greatest glaciation, were not invaded by\r\nthe ice-sheet underneath which the upper boulder-clay was accumulated.\r\nThis latest ice-sheet, however, overwhelmed all Mecklenburg and Mark\r\nBrandenburg, and streamed south nearly as far as Saxony; its southern\r\nmargin extended east through Silesia, by Liegnitz and Breslau, into\r\nPoland and Russia. But the precise line it followed in the latter\r\ncountry has yet to be ascertained. We may surmise, however, that it\r\nnowhere reached so far south or east as the ice-flow of the earlier\r\nepoch. I may add that the southern termination of the latest ice-sheet\r\nis in many places marked out by heaps, mounds, and ridges of earthy\r\nsand, gravel, rolled stones, and erratics; in short, by terminal\r\nmoraines. These, however, are frequently highly degraded and washed\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n[M] Klockmann, _Jahrb. der k. preuss. geol. Landesanstalt für 1883_, p.\r\n330.\r\n\r\nOf the extension of glacier-ice in the British Islands at the epoch\r\nin question I shall only say that the glaciation of Scotland was\r\nhardly, if at all, less extensive than during the climax of the Ice\r\nAge. Ireland, too, appears to have been almost as thickly mantled;\r\nbut the ice-sheet that covered England and Wales did not extend so\r\nfar south as that of the penultimate glacial epoch, a considerable\r\narea in East Anglia and the midland counties remaining apparently free\r\nfrom invasion. The Scandinavian and British ice-sheets, however, again\r\ncoalesced upon the floor of the North Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_The Results of Fluvio-glacial Action in Europe._\r\n\r\nThe third question which I now proceed to consider is the result\r\nproduced by the rivers and torrents of the Ice Age. This, I am aware,\r\nis a wide subject, and one upon which much has been written. But there\r\nare a few points which may be advantageously discussed for the purpose\r\nof bringing into prominent view the conditions which obtained in the\r\nriver-valleys of Europe during the last great extension of glacier-ice.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will serve to convince one that the intense\r\nglacial conditions that obtained in our Continent during the cold\r\nepochs of the glacial period were due to a low temperature, combined\r\nwith excessive snow-fall. The winters, we can have no doubt, must have\r\nbeen prolonged and severe. But mere low temperature will not account\r\nfor the enormous precipitation of snow. For this, great evaporation\r\nwas required. And we are therefore forced to admit that the direct\r\nheat of the sun in summer must have been greater than it is in the\r\nsame regions at the present day. Now, if this were really the case\r\n(and I do not see how otherwise the facts can be explained), then we\r\nought to meet with evidence of swollen rivers, torrents, and widespread\r\ninundations everywhere outside of the glaciated areas. And this is\r\nprecisely what we do find. Immense accumulations of coarse gravels\r\nare widely spread over all the valleys that head in regions which\r\nwere formerly the sites of snow-fields and glaciers. These gravels\r\nare of such a character and are so distributed as to make it certain\r\nthat they could not have been transported to and deposited in their\r\npresent positions by rivers like those which now wind their way down\r\nthe valleys of middle Europe. Still more remarkable are the enormous\r\nsheets of loam which are spread over much wider areas and reach to more\r\nconsiderable heights than the gravels. The origin of the gravels is\r\nsufficiently evident; they are simply the coarser detritus, swept along\r\nby the enormously flooded rivers of the glacial period, and meet with\r\ntheir analogues in the torrential gravels of modern glacier-valleys\r\nin the Alps and other elevated regions. The more widely-spread loams,\r\naccording to the opinion of most glacialists, represent the finer mud\r\nand silt deposited from the muddy waters of the same period. But the\r\nheight to which such gravels and loams ascend is so great that those\r\nwho hold them to be of fluvio-glacial origin have found it difficult\r\nto maintain this view. Some writers, indeed, who have not sufficiently\r\nconsidered the weight of the evidence in its favour, have set it aside,\r\nand boldly suggested all kinds of wonderful hypotheses in its place.\r\nOne imaginative author, for example, believes the wide-spread loams to\r\nbe of volcanic origin, while another finds in the same deposits strong\r\nevidence of the Deluge. By a well-known and experienced observer,\r\nthe famous löss of middle Europe is considered to be an Æolian\r\naccumulation--that is to say, a wind-blown deposit--the result of\r\nlong-continued or frequently-repeated dust-storms. This is the opinion\r\nof Baron Richthofen, whose great work on China is so justly esteemed.\r\nHe infers that at the time of the formation of our löss central Europe\r\nwas a dry desiccated region, just as wide areas in central Asia are\r\nin our own day. He does not attempt to show us, however, how such\r\nclimatic conditions could ever obtain in Europe. In point of fact, the\r\ngeographical conditions of our Continent have not changed materially\r\nsince Pleistocene times, and the presence of the wide Atlantic Ocean,\r\nthat laves all our western shores, is of itself sufficient to preclude\r\nthe possibility of such a climate having obtained in middle Europe.\r\nRichthofen's theory likewise fails to account for the geographical\r\ndistribution of the löss, and for many facts relating to its geology.\r\nOnly one of these last shall I mention. The löss is intimately\r\nassociated with accumulations, the glacial and fluvio-glacial origin of\r\nwhich cannot be doubted. It belongs, in fact, to the glacial series,\r\nand was laid down at a time when vast snow-fields and ice-sheets\r\nexisted, and when it is quite impossible that a dry climate could\r\nhave characterised any part of our Continent. In common with most\r\ngeologists, I believe that the löss is simply an inundation-mud,\r\ndeposited in temporary lakes and over flooded areas during the summer\r\nmeltings of the snow- and ice-fields; and I shall now try to show how\r\nthe occurrence at high levels of gravels and such loams as the löss\r\nmay be accounted for without having recourse to volcanic action or to\r\nwinds, or even to the Deluge. I shall invoke no agencies other than\r\nthose which we are perfectly well assured were in full operation during\r\nthe Ice Age.\r\n\r\nNow, I ask you, in the first place, to bear in mind that while a\r\nglacial epoch continued, extreme conditions could not have been\r\nrestricted to the areas undergoing glaciation. There is abundant\r\nevidence, indeed, to show that heavy, snows occasionally covered other\r\nregions, and that in such places severe frosts acted upon the rocks\r\nand soils even of the low-grounds. Need we wonder if at a time when\r\nthe northern ice-sheet approached the fiftieth parallel of latitude\r\nin middle Europe, when almost every mountain-group of central and\r\nsouthern Europe had its snow-fields and glaciers--need we wonder if at\r\nsuch a time the climate of wide areas outside of the glaciated tracts\r\nwas extremely ungenial? The more closely the superficial accumulations\r\nof such areas are studied, the more clearly do we perceive in them\r\nthe evidence of cold and humid conditions. Try, then, to picture to\r\nyourselves the probable aspect of those regions during a glacial epoch.\r\nImmediately south of the northern ice-sheet deep snows must have buried\r\nlarge tracts of country, and such snows may have endured often for long\r\nyears, notwithstanding the great melting that took place in summer.\r\nEven much further south, as in Spain and Italy, deep snows would cover\r\nthe lesser hills and hill-ranges, while frost would act energetically\r\nin many a district where such action is now either inconsiderable or\r\nunknown. Such being the general conditions that must have obtained in\r\nthe non-glaciated areas, let us very briefly consider what the results\r\nof such conditions must necessarily have been. Every one has noticed,\r\nduring the more or less rapid melting of snow in winter and early\r\nspring, that our streams and rivers are then much muddier than when in\r\nsummer and autumn they are swollen by heavy rains. This of course is\r\ndue to the action of frost, by means of which rocks are disintegrated\r\nand soils are broken up and pulverised, so that when thaw supervenes,\r\nthe superficial covering becomes soaked with moisture like a sponge.\r\nTo such an extent does this take place, that one may often see the\r\nsaturated soil creeping, slipping, and even flowing down the slopes.\r\nThe effect of mere thaw is of course much intensified when the water\r\nderived from melting snows is present. Rills and tiny brooks then\r\nbecome converted into dark muddy torrents, and enormous quantities of\r\nfine-grained detritus are eventually swept into the rivers. The rivers\r\nrise in flood and inundate their plains, over the surface of which\r\nconsiderable deposits of loam and silt often accumulate. We cannot\r\ndoubt that similar but much more intense action must have taken place\r\nover very wide regions in Europe during a glacial epoch. Such having\r\nnecessarily been the case, we are not required to suppose that the\r\nlöss and similar loams have been deposited entirely by rivers flowing\r\nfrom glaciers. It is doubtless true that most of the rivers headed in\r\nthose days in glacier regions, and must in consequence have been highly\r\ndiscoloured with glacial mud, and probably a very large proportion of\r\nthe loams in question consists of the fine flour of rocks--the result\r\nof glacial grinding. But the action of frost and thaw and melting snow\r\nupon the low-grounds, such as I have described, cannot be ignored,\r\nand seems to have played a more important _rôle_ than has yet been\r\nrecognised. I think it helps us better to explain the well-known fact\r\nthat land-shells are more or less commonly distributed through the\r\nlöss. One can readily understand, at all events, how snail-shells might\r\nbe swept down the slopes of the land at the time of the spring thaws,\r\nand how large numbers might find their way eventually into the swollen\r\nglacial rivers. I have often observed, during the melting of snow and\r\nthe thawing of soils, quantities of snail-shells in the very act of\r\nbeing swept into our brooks and rills. And we are all familiar with the\r\nfact that, after a spring-flood has subsided, snail-shells, along with\r\nvegetable débris, are often plentifully stranded upon the valley-slopes\r\nand flood-plains of our rivers.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, then, that the löss and similar accumulations are simply\r\ninundation-loams formed at a time when glaciers were discharging\r\nimmense volumes of muddy water, and when the low-grounds were liable\r\nevery summer to the denuding action of melting snows, and so forth, I\r\nhave yet to account for the fact that these supposed inundation-loams\r\nsometimes occur at a height of 100 feet, or even of 300 feet, above\r\nthe present levels of the rivers. Two theories have been advanced in\r\nexplanation, each of which seems to me to contain an element of truth.\r\nIt has, in the first place, been maintained, as by Prestwich, that the\r\nlöss at the higher levels was probably deposited long before the rivers\r\nhad excavated their channels to their present depths. Thus, during\r\nflood, they would be enabled to overflow tracts which they could not\r\npossibly have reached when they had deepened their valleys to a much\r\ngreater degree. But while we must fully admit that the erosion effected\r\nby the rivers of the Pleistocene or Glacial period was excessive, yet\r\nwe find it difficult or impossible to believe that great valleys,\r\nseveral miles in width, and two or three hundred feet in depth, were\r\nexcavated in hard Devonian and other equally durable rocks by the\r\nswollen and active rivers of the Ice Age. And although it is extremely\r\nprobable that the löss at the highest levels is older than the similar\r\ndeposit at the lowest levels of such a valley as the Rhine, yet this\r\ndoes not get us out of our difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe other view to which I have alluded takes little or no account\r\nof river-erosion, but maintains that the floods of the Ice Age were\r\nsufficiently great to reach the highest levels at which river-gravels\r\nand loams occur. It is likely enough that, under present conditions, we\r\ncan form but a very inadequate idea of the vast bodies of freshwater\r\nwhich formerly swept down our valleys, but we may be pardoned if we\r\nexpress our inability to conceive of our European rivers flowing with a\r\nbreadth of many miles, and a depth of two or three hundred feet.\r\n\r\nA few years before his death, Mr. Darwin made a suggestion to me, which\r\nI think gives us the true solution of the problem. He thought that\r\nduring an Ice Age great beds of frozen snow might have accumulated\r\nover the low-grounds outside of the glaciated areas (in the manner I\r\nhave already described), and that many valleys might have been filled\r\nto a considerable depth during a large part of the year with blown\r\nsnow, afterwards congealed. In autumn, when the running water failed,\r\nthe lines of drainage might in many cases be more or less choked, and\r\nit would be a mere chance whether the drainage, together with gravel,\r\nsand, and mud, would follow precisely the same lines during the next\r\nsummer. Such action being repeated year after year, it might well\r\nhappen that many river-valleys might become largely filled with rudely\r\nalternating layers of frozen snow and fluviatile detritus. And if this\r\nwere so, the flooded rivers in summer would be enabled to overflow much\r\nwider and more elevated tracts than they could otherwise have reached.\r\nAs the climate became less excessive, we can conceive of the frozen\r\nsnows gradually melting, and of river-detritus being deposited at lower\r\nand lower levels in the valleys.\r\n\r\nThe probability of such frozen masses having choked up valleys and\r\nimpeded the drainage during the Ice Age is not a mere plausible\r\nconjecture. In the far north of Alaska--in a region which was certainly\r\nnot overflowed by the North American ice-cap--extensive sheets of ice\r\noccur, more or less deeply buried under thick soil. Nor can there\r\nbe much doubt that these ice-masses date back to the Glacial period\r\nitself, seeing that in the soils which overlie them we meet with\r\nremains of the mammoth and other contemporaneous mammalian forms.\r\nHere, then, we have direct proof of the fact of frozen snow and ice\r\nhaving accumulated in the hollows of the land outside of the glaciated\r\nareas.[N]\r\n\r\n[N] I have given Mr. Darwin's views, and discussed the origin of the\r\nPleistocene fluvio-glacial deposits at some length in _Prehistoric\r\nEurope_, chaps, viii. and ix. To this work I refer for detailed\r\ngeological evidence in support of the view advocated above.\r\n\r\nNow, if such conditions existed in the valleys of middle Europe,\r\nthe widespread loss of those regions is readily accounted for. The\r\noccurrence of irregular sheets and shreds of gravel and loam at\r\nheights of more than a hundred feet above a valley-bottom offers no\r\ndifficulty--it is in fact precisely the kind of phenomenon we might\r\nhave expected. We are therefore not required to go out of our way to\r\ndream about impossible volcanic action, or to call upon the winds\r\nof heaven to help us, or upon the waters of the Deluge to float us\r\nout of our difficulties. But while I believe the views I have now\r\nadvocated sufficiently account for the appearances presented by the\r\nancient valley-gravels and loams of central Europe, there are two very\r\nconsiderable areas of löss which require some further explanation. The\r\nfirst of these is that broad belt of löss which extends from west to\r\neast across the plains of northern Germany, and the northern boundary\r\nof which coincides with the limits reached by the last great ice-sheet,\r\nfrom which it spreads south to the foot-hills of the Harz, and other\r\nmountains of middle Europe. Here we have a sheet of löss which bears\r\nno apparent relation to the valley-systems of the region in which it\r\noccurs. But the fact of its northern boundary being coincident with the\r\nterminal front of the last great northern ice-sheet at once suggests\r\nits origin. It is evident that this ice-sheet must have blocked the\r\nrivers flowing north, and dammed back their waters.[O] A wide sheet\r\nof muddy water must therefore have extended east and west over the\r\nvery area which is now covered by the belt of löss in question. This\r\ntemporary lake would doubtless be subject to great alternations of\r\nlevel--a portion draining away perhaps under the ice-sheet--but the\r\nwater would for the most part make its way westward, and eventually\r\nescape into the English Channel. From the waters of this great lake,\r\nfed by many large glacial rivers, abundant precipitation of loam and\r\nsilt must have taken place.\r\n\r\n[O] The late Mr. Belt, as is well known, was of opinion that all the\r\nrivers flowing north in Europe and Asia were dammed back by a great\r\nPolar glacier, and that all the low-tracts in the northern portions of\r\nthe two continents were thus covered by wide inland seas of freshwater.\r\nAs I do not believe that such a Polar ice-cap existed during the\r\nGlacial period, I cannot agree with Mr. Belt that the alluvial plains\r\nof northern Siberia mark the sites of ice-dammed lakes.\r\n\r\nThe second and by far the most extensive sheet of löss in Europe is\r\nthe so-called \"black earth,\" or \"tchernozem,\" with which such enormous\r\ntracts in southern Russia are covered. This widespread löss--for such\r\nit really is--I have elsewhere tried to show consists of the flood-loam\r\nand inundation-muds laid down by the water escaping along the margin\r\nof the northern ice-sheet, which discharged its drainage in the\r\ndirection of the Black Sea, its black colour being due to the grinding\r\ndown and pulverising of the black Jurassic shales which extend over\r\nsuch wide regions in middle Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_The Extent of Glaciation in North America._\r\n\r\nThe various phenomena of glaciation which go to prove that a great\r\nice-sheet formerly covered a wide region in northern Europe are\r\ndeveloped on a still more extensive scale in North America. Smoothed\r\nand striated rock-surfaces, crushed and dislocated rock-masses, and\r\nenormous accumulations of morainic débris and fluvio-glacial detritus,\r\nall combine to tell the same tale. The morainic accumulations of North\r\nAmerica have been distributed upon the same principles as the similar\r\ndeposits of our own Continent. Boulder-clay of precisely the same\r\ncharacter as that of Scotland and Scandinavia, of Switzerland and north\r\nItaly, covers vast tracts in the low-grounds of the British Possessions\r\nand the northern States of the Union, where it forms enormous sheets,\r\nvarying in thickness from 30 or 50 up to 100 feet or more. In the rough\r\nLaurentian high-lands, however, it is more sparingly developed, and\r\nthe same is the case in the hilly regions of New England. In short,\r\nit thickens out upon the low-grounds, and thins off upon the steeper\r\nslopes, while it attains its greatest thickness and forms the most\r\ncontinuous sheets in the country that lies south of the great lakes.\r\n\r\nThe southern limits of this deposit form a kind of rude semi-circle.\r\nFrom New York the boundary-line has been followed north-west through\r\nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania to beyond the forty-second parallel,\r\nafter which it turns to the south-west, passing down through Ohio to\r\nCincinnati (39°); then, striking west and south-west through Indiana,\r\nit traverses the southern portion of Illinois. Its course after\r\nit reaches the valley of the Missouri has been only approximately\r\ndetermined, but it turns at last rather abruptly to the north-west,\r\nsweeping away in that direction through Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota, and\r\nMontana.\r\n\r\nThe general course followed by the ice-sheet underneath which this\r\nboulder-clay was formed has been well ascertained, partly by the\r\nevidence of the clay and its contents, and partly by that of _roches\r\nmoutonnées_ and striated rocks. The observations of geologists in\r\nCanada and the States leave it in no doubt that an enormous sheet\r\nof ice flowed south over all the tracts which are now covered with\r\nboulder-clay. During a recent visit to Canada and the States, I had\r\nopportunities of examining the glacial deposits at various points\r\nover a somewhat extensive area, and everywhere I found the exact\r\ncounterparts of our own accumulations. In Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa,\r\nIllinois, Indiana, and Ohio, and again in New York, Connecticut, and\r\nMassachusetts, and the low-grounds of Canada, I recognised boulder-clay\r\nof precisely the same character as that with which we are familiar at\r\nhome. The glacial phenomena of the Hudson valley and of the lower part\r\nof the Connecticut River were especially interesting. In those regions\r\nthe evidence of a southward flow of the ice is most conspicuous, and\r\nthe phenomena, down to the smallest details, exactly recalled those of\r\nmany parts of Europe. Professor Dana, under whose guidance I visited\r\nthe Connecticut valley, showed me, at a considerable height upon the\r\nvalley-slope, an ancient water-course, charged with gravel and shingle,\r\nwhich could not possibly have been laid down under present conditions.\r\nIt was, in fact, a sub-glacial water-course, and resembled the similar\r\nwater-courses which are associated with boulder-clay in our own country.\r\n\r\nIf I met with only familiar glacial phenomena in the low-lying tracts\r\ntraversed by me, I certainly saw nothing strange or abnormal in the\r\nhillier tracts. In passing over the dreary regions between the valley\r\nof the Red River and Lake Superior I was constantly reminded of the\r\nbleak tracts of Archæan gneiss in the north-west of Scotland, and\r\nof the similar rough broken uplands in many parts of Scandinavia and\r\nFinland. The whole of that wild land is _moutonnée_. Rough tors and\r\ncrags are smoothed off, while boulder-clay nestles on the lee-side. In\r\nthe hollows between the _roches moutonnées_ are straggling lakes and\r\npools and bogs innumerable. Frequently, too, one comes upon rounded\r\ncones and smooth banks of morainic gravel and sand, and heaps of coarse\r\nshingle and boulders, while erratics in thousands are scattered over\r\nthe whole district. If you wish to have a fair notion of the geological\r\naspect of the region I refer to, you will find samples of it in many\r\nparts of the Outer Hebrides and western Ross-shire and Sutherland.\r\nCover those latter districts with scraggy pines, and their resemblance\r\nto the uplands of Canada will be complete.\r\n\r\nFrom descriptions given by travellers it would appear that morainic\r\ndetritus--mounds and sheets of stony clay, gravel and sand, shingle,\r\nboulders, and erratics--are more or less plentifully sprinkled over\r\nall the British Possessions and the islands of the Arctic Archipelago;\r\nso that we have every reason to believe that the ice-sheet which left\r\nits moraines at New York and Cincinnati extended northwards to the\r\nArctic Ocean. Nor can there be much doubt that this same _mer de glace_\r\nbecame confluent in the west with the great glaciers that streamed\r\noutwards from the Rocky Mountains; while we know for a certainty that\r\nthe southern portion of Alaska, together with British Columbia and\r\nVancouver Island, were buried in ice that flowed outwards into the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern sea-board north of New York city there is no tract\r\nwhich has not been overflowed by ice. The islands in Boston Harbour are\r\nmade up for the most part of tough boulder-clay; and boulder-clay and\r\nstriated rocks occur also in Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nThus we may say that the ice-covered region of North America was\r\nbounded on the north by the Arctic, on the west by the Pacific, and on\r\nthe east by the Atlantic Oceans. The Rocky Mountains, however, divided\r\nthe great _mer de glace_ that overflowed Canada and the States from\r\nthe ice that streamed outwards to the Pacific. Measured from the base\r\nof the Rockies to the Atlantic, the _mer de glace_ of Canada and the\r\nStates must have exceeded 2500 miles in width, and it stretched from\r\nnorth to south over 40 degrees of latitude.\r\n\r\nOutside of this vast region and the great mountain-ranges of the\r\nfar west, there are few hilly areas in the States which reach any\r\nconsiderable elevation. South of the _mers de glace_ of the north and\r\nwest, no such mountain-groups as those of middle and southern Europe\r\noccur, and consequently we do not expect to meet with many traces\r\nof local glaciation. Nevertheless, these have been recognised in\r\nthe Alleghany Mountains, West Virginia, and in the Unaka Mountains,\r\nbetween Tennessee and North Carolina. But the glaciers of those minor\r\nhill-ranges were of course mere pigmies in comparison with the enormous\r\nice-streams that flowed down the valleys of the Rocky Mountains and\r\nthe Sierra Nevada. Even as far south as the Sierra Madre of Mexico\r\nglaciers seem formerly to have existed; and Mr. Belt has described the\r\noccurrence of what he considered to be boulder-clays at a height of\r\n2000 to 3000 feet in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the fact that in Europe we have, outside of the\r\nglaciated areas, certain accumulations (such as the Gibraltar breccias)\r\nwhich could only have been formed under the influence of extreme cold.\r\nSimilar accumulations occur in North Carolina, where they have been\r\ncarefully studied by Mr. W. C. Kerr. According to Mr. Kerr, these\r\ndeposits have crept down the declivities of the ground under the\r\ninfluence of successive freezings and thawings; and now that attention\r\nhas been called to such phenomena, our American friends will doubtless\r\ndetect similar appearances in many other places.\r\n\r\nThe facts which I have now briefly indicated suffice to show that\r\nduring the climax of glaciation North America must have presented\r\nvery much the same appearance as Europe. Each continent had its great\r\nnorthern ice-sheet, south of which local glaciers existed in hilly\r\ndistricts, many of which are now far below the limits of perennial\r\nsnow. We may note, also, that in each continent the _mers de glace_\r\nattained their greatest development over those regions which at the\r\npresent day have the largest rainfall. Following the southern limits\r\nof glaciation in Europe, we are led at first directly east, until we\r\nreach central Russia, when the line we follow trends rapidly away to\r\nthe north-east. The like is the case with North America. Trace the\r\nsouthern boundary of the ice-sheet west of New York, and you find,\r\nwhen you reach the valley of the Missouri, that it bends away to the\r\nnorth-west. Now we can hardly doubt that one principal reason for\r\nthe non-appearance of the _mer de glace_ in the far east of Europe\r\nand the far west of America was simply a diminishing snow-fall.\r\nThose non-glaciated regions which lay north of the latitudes reached\r\nby the ice-sheets were dry regions in glacial times for the same\r\nreasons that they are dry still. The only differences between glacial\r\nEurope and America were differences due to geographical position and\r\nphysical features. The glaciation of the Urals was comparatively\r\nunimportant, because those mountains, being flanked on either side by\r\nvast land-areas, could have had only a limited snow-fall; while the\r\nmountain-ranges of western North America, on the other hand, being\r\nsituated near the Pacific, could not fail to be copiously supplied. For\r\nobvious reasons, also, the North American ice-sheet greatly exceeded\r\nthat of Europe. In all other respects the conditions were similar in\r\nboth continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n_Changes of Climate in North America during the Ice Age._\r\n\r\nAmerican geologists are now pretty well agreed that their \"interglacial\r\ndeposits\"--the existence of which is not disputed--have precisely the\r\nsame meaning as the similar deposits which occur in Europe. They tell\r\nof great climatic changes. At present, however, there is no certain\r\nevidence in the American deposits of more than one interglacial epoch;\r\nbut the proofs of such an epoch having obtained are overwhelming.\r\nThe occurrence again and again of fossiliferous beds intercalated\r\nbetween two separate and distinct sheets of boulder-clay and morainic\r\naccumulations, leaves us in no doubt that we are dealing with precisely\r\nthe same phenomena which confront us in Europe. No mere partial\r\nrecession and re-advance of the _mer de glace_ will account for the\r\nfacts. We have seen that during the culmination of the Glacial period\r\nthe American ice-sheet overflowed Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Now\r\ninterglacial deposits occur as far north as the Canadian shores of\r\nLakes Ontario and Superior, so that all the country to the south must\r\nhave been uncovered by ice before those interglacial deposits were\r\nlaid down. But the evidence entitles us to say much more than this.\r\nThe interglacial beds of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and other States,\r\nafford abundant evidence of a great forest-growth having covered the\r\nregions vacated by the ice of the penultimate glacial epoch. The trees\r\nof this forest-land included sycamore, beech, hickory, red-cedar, and\r\nothers; and amongst the plants were grape vines of enormous growth,\r\nwhich, according to Professor Cox, \"indicate perhaps the luxuriance\r\nof a warmer climate.\" At all events, the climate that nourished such\r\na forest-growth could not have been less genial than the present. And\r\nsuch being the case, we may reasonably infer that the vast regions to\r\nthe north of the lakes were no more inhospitable then than they are now.\r\n\r\nTo this genial interglacial epoch succeeded the last glacial epoch,\r\nwhen a great ice-sheet once more enveloped a wide area. In the extreme\r\neast this latest _mer de glace_ appears to have reached as far south\r\nas that of the earlier epoch; but as we follow its terminal moraines\r\nwestward they lead us further and further away from the southern\r\nlimits attained by the preceding ice-sheet. These great terminal\r\nmoraines form an interesting study, and the general results obtained by\r\nAmerican observers have been very carefully put together by Professor\r\nChamberlin. I traversed wide regions of those moraines in Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and, so far as my observations\r\nwent, I could only confirm the conclusions arrived at by Professor\r\nChamberlin and others. The mounds, banks, cones, and ridges are\r\nunquestionably moraines--of enormous dimensions, no doubt, but in all\r\ntheir phenomena strictly analogous to similar gravelly moraines in our\r\nown country and the Continent. Many of the American moraines consist\r\nalmost entirely of water-worn material--sand, gravel, shingle, and\r\nboulders, together with large angular and sub-angular erratics. These\r\ndeposits are generally stratified, and frequently show diagonal or\r\nfalse-bedding. In this and other respects they exactly reproduce--but\r\nof course on a much larger scale--our Scottish kames, and the similar\r\naccumulations of north Germany and Finland, and the low-grounds of\r\nItaly opposite the mouths of the great Alpine lakes. The kames of\r\nWisconsin again and again reminded me of the gravelly moraines that\r\ncover the ground for many miles round the lower end of Lake Garda.\r\nIt is this gravelly and sandy aspect of the American moraines that\r\nis most conspicuous, water-assorted materials seeming everywhere to\r\nform their upper and outer portions. Now and again, however, a deep\r\ncutting discloses underneath and behind such water-worn detritus a\r\nmass of confused materials, consisting of clay, sand, gravel, shingle,\r\nand boulders, which are angular and sub-angular, often smoothed and\r\nstriated, and of all shapes and sizes. According to Mr. Chamberlin,\r\nthis unstratified material \"is indistinguishable from true till, and\r\nis doubtless to be regarded as till pushed up into corrugations by the\r\nmechanical action of the ice.\"\r\n\r\nThis grand series of moraines stretches from the peninsula of Cape Cod\r\nacross the northern States, and passes in a north-westerly direction\r\ninto the British Possessions, over which it has been followed for some\r\n400 miles. The disposition of the moraines, forming as they do a series\r\nof great loops, shows that the ice-sheet terminated in a number of\r\nlobes or gigantic tongue-like processes. Nothing seen by me suggested\r\nany marine action; on the contrary, every appearance, as I have said,\r\nbetokened the morainic origin of the mounds; and Mr. Chamberlin assured\r\nme that their peculiar distribution was everywhere suggestive of this\r\norigin. No one who has traversed the regions I refer to is at all\r\nlikely to agree with Sir W. Dawson's view, that the American mounds,\r\netc., are the shore-accumulations of an ice-laden sea.\r\n\r\nThe morainic origin of these accumulations having been demonstrated\r\nby American geologists, we are now able to draw another parallel\r\nbetween the European and American glacial deposits. We have seen that\r\nin Europe the ice-sheet of the latest glacial epoch was by no means\r\nso extensive as that of the preceding glacial epoch. The same was\r\nthe case in North America. Moreover, in America, just as in Europe,\r\nthe latest occupant of the land was not the sea, but glacier-ice.\r\nIn Scotland and Scandinavia the gradual disappearance of the latest\r\nice-sheets was marked by a partial submergence, which in the former\r\ncountry did not greatly exceed 100 feet, and in the latter 700 feet.\r\nIn America, in like manner, we find traces of a similar partial\r\nsubmergence. In Connecticut this did not exceed 40 or 50 feet, but\r\nincreased to some 500 feet in the St. Lawrence, and to over 1000 feet\r\nin the Arctic regions. If there ever was during the Glacial period a\r\ngreater submergence than this in North America it must have taken place\r\nin earlier glacial or interglacial times, but of such a submergence\r\nno trace has yet been recognised. In this respect the American record\r\ndiffers somewhat from our own, for in Britain we have evidence of a\r\nsubmergence of over 1000 feet, which supervened in times immediately\r\npreceding the latest great extension of continental ice.[P] But nowhere\r\nin middle Europe, and nowhere in North America, in the region south\r\nand west of the great lakes, is there any trace of a general marine\r\nsubmergence. The \"Palæocrystic Sea\" is as idle a dream for the northern\r\nStates of America as it is for any part of Europe.\r\n\r\n[P] See footnote, p. 173.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n_The Results of Fluvio-glacial Action in North America._\r\n\r\nThe close analogies which obtain between the glacial and interglacial\r\ndeposits of Europe and North America are equally characteristic\r\nof the fluvio-glacial accumulations of the two continents. As in\r\nEurope, so in America we meet with considerable sheets of gravel and\r\nshingle, sand, fine clay, and loam, which are evidently of freshwater\r\norigin. In the gently-undulating tracts of the northern States those\r\ndeposits often spread continuously over wide regions; in the hillier\r\ndistricts, however, they are most characteristic of the valleys. They\r\nare very well represented, for example, in the Connecticut valley,\r\nwhere they have been carefully studied by Professor Dana. Like the\r\nsimilar deposits of our own Continent, they have been laid down by\r\nthe torrents and swollen rivers of the Glacial period. The great\r\nrange of moraines which marks the extreme limits reached by the\r\nlatest ice-sheet is generally associated with sheets of gravel and\r\nsand, which one can see at a glance are of contemporaneous origin,\r\nhaving been spread out by the water escaping from the melting ice.\r\nNor can one doubt that the vast sheets of löss in the Missouri and\r\nMississippi valleys are strictly analogous in origin, as they are in\r\nstructure and disposition, to the löss of Europe. I have spoken of the\r\nprobable existence of a glacial lake formed by the damming back of\r\nthe Rhine and other rivers by the European ice-sheet. Now, in North\r\nAmerica we meet with evidence of the same phenomenon. When the last\r\nice-sheet of that continent attained its maximum development, all the\r\nwater escaping from its margin in the north States necessarily flowed\r\nsouth into the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. But in course of time\r\nthe ice melted away beyond the drainage-area of those rivers, and\r\ndisappeared from the valley of the Red River of the north, which, it\r\nwill be remembered, empties itself northward into Lake Winnipeg. When\r\nthe ice-front had retired so far it naturally impeded the drainage of\r\nthe Red River basin, and thus formed a vast glacial lake, the limits\r\nof which have been approximately mapped out by Mr. Upham, by whom the\r\nancient lake has been designated Lake Agassiz. The deposits laid down\r\nin this lake consist of finely laminated clays, etc., which resemble in\r\nevery particular the similar unfossiliferous clays so frequently found\r\nassociated with glacial accumulations in Europe. Had the drainage of\r\nthe Red River valley been south instead of north, the clays and loams\r\nof the far north-west would not have been arrested and spread out where\r\nthey now are, and Manitoba would have been covered for the most part\r\nwith loose shingle, gravel, and sand.\r\n\r\nThus the final disappearance of the American ice-sheet was marked\r\nby the formation not only of moraines, but of flood-gravels and\r\ntorrential- and inundation-deposits of the same character as those with\r\nwhich we are familiar at home. Wherever similar geographical conditions\r\nprevailed, there similar geological results followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThere are many other points of resemblance between the glacial and\r\nfluvio-glacial accumulations of the two continents, but to these time\r\nforbids any reference. Indeed, I cannot recall any signal difference.\r\nSuch differences as do occur are due simply to the varying conditions\r\nof the two continental areas. The glacial phenomena of North America\r\nare a repetition of those of Europe, but upon a much grander scale. The\r\nboulder-clays of the former continent, in their composition, structure,\r\nand distribution, exactly recall our own. Interglacial beds occur\r\nunder similar circumstances in both continents; and the same is the\r\ncase with the gravelly moraines and fluvio-glacial accumulations.\r\nWe are driven, then, to the conclusion that the physical conditions\r\nof the Glacial period were practically the same in Europe and North\r\nAmerica. What those conditions were I have already indicated, and have\r\nshown that the results arrived at by geologists are not vague dreams\r\nand speculations, but a logical induction from well-ascertained facts.\r\nBefore we can believe that volcanic eruptions, a general deluge, or a\r\nPalæocrystic Sea have produced the many varied phenomena of our glacial\r\nformations, either in whole or in part, we must first shut our eyes and\r\nthen erase from our minds all knowledge of the facts which have been so\r\nlaboriously gathered by a long succession of competent observers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                               PLATE III\r\n\r\n                          DISTRIBUTION OF ICE\r\n                           PAST AND PRESENT.\r\n\r\n                              POLAR VIEW\r\n                                OF THE\r\n                                 WORLD\r\n                   ON LAMBERTS EQUAL AREA PROJECTION\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe Intercrossing of Erratics in Glacial Deposits.[Q]\r\n\r\n[Q] _The Scottish Naturalist_, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many phenomena connected with the glacial deposits of this\r\ncountry which have puzzled geologists there is none more remarkable\r\nthan the \"intercrossing of erratics.\" The fact that such wandered\r\nblocks have apparently crossed each other's tracks in their journeys\r\nappears at first sight inexplicable on the assumption that their\r\ntransport has been effected by land-ice. The phenomena in question,\r\ntherefore, have always been appealed to by those who uphold the\r\niceberg origin of our boulder-clays, etc., as evidence decisively in\r\nfavour of their views. No one can deny that any degree and amount of\r\nintercrossing might take place in the case of icebergs. We can readily\r\nconceive how floating ice, detached from a long line of coast, might be\r\ncompelled by shifting winds and changing currents to tack about again\r\nand again, so as to pursue the most devious course, and scatter their\r\nstony burdens in the most erratic manner over the sea-bottom; while,\r\non the other hand, it is quite impossible to understand how a similar\r\nirregular distribution of erratics could take place under one and the\r\nsame glacier flowing in a determinate direction. It is little wonder,\r\nthen, that the curious phenomena of the intercrossing of erratics\r\nshould have had much importance attached to it by the upholders of\r\nthe iceberg theory, seeing that all the other proofs which have been\r\nadduced in favour of this theory have only served to demonstrate its\r\ninsufficiency. Upon the facts connected with the intercrossing of\r\nerratics, the supporters of this time-honoured theory are now making\r\nwhat I must believe is their last stand. I purpose therefore, in this\r\npaper, to give a short outline of those facts, with the view of showing\r\nthat so far from being antagonistic to the land-ice theory, they are in\r\ncomplete harmony with it; and indeed must be considered as affording an\r\nadditional demonstration of its truth.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I called attention to the fact that in the middle\r\ndistricts of Scotland the boulder-clay not infrequently contains a\r\ncurious commingling of northern and southern erratics.[R] I showed\r\nthat this was the case throughout a belt of country extending from the\r\nsea-coast near Ayr, north-east to the valley of the Irvine, and thence\r\nacross the watershed into the Avon, and east to Lesmahagow, then down\r\nthe valley of the Clyde to Carluke, stretching away to the east by\r\nWilsontown, and thereafter continuing along the crest of the Pentlands\r\nand the northern slopes of the Lammermuir Hills, by Reston and Ayton,\r\nto the sea. \"All along this line,\" I remarked, \"we have a 'debatable\r\nground' of variable breadth, throughout which we find a commingling in\r\nthe till of stones which have come from north and from south. South of\r\nit, characteristic Highland stones do not occur, and north of it stones\r\nderived from the south are similarly absent.\" The explanation of these\r\nfacts is obvious. The belt of ground referred to was evidently the\r\nmeeting-place of the Highland and southern _mers de glace_. Here the\r\ntwo opposing ice-flows coalesced and became deflected by their mutual\r\npressure to right and left--one great current going east and another\r\nwest. It is evident that the line of junction between the two _mers de\r\nglace_ could not be rigorously maintained in one and the same position\r\nduring a period of glaciation, but would tend to oscillate backwards\r\nand forwards, according as one or the other ice-sheet prevailed.\r\nSometimes the southern ice-sheet would be enabled to push back the\r\nnorthern _mer de glace_, while at other times the converse would take\r\nplace. Nor is it necessary to suppose that the advance of one ice-sheet\r\nwas general along the whole line. On the contrary, it is most likely\r\nthat the movement was quite irregular--an ice-sheet advancing in some\r\nplaces, while at other points its line of junction with the opposing\r\nice-sheet remained stationary, or even retrograded. Such movements\r\nwould obviously give rise to oscillations in the sub-glacial débris of\r\nclay and stones; and thus we have a simple and natural explanation of\r\nthose intercrossings of erratics which are so characteristic of that\r\nregion which I have termed the \"debatable ground.\" And this conclusion\r\nis borne out by the fact that the glacial striæ of the same \"debatable\r\nground\" afford like evidence of oscillation in the trend of the\r\nice-flow.\r\n\r\n[R] _Great Ice Age_, 2nd edit., p. 609.\r\n\r\nAlong the base of the Highland mountains in Forfarshire, etc., we\r\nmeet with similar intercrossings of erratics. Thus we occasionally\r\nencounter in the boulder-clays overlying the Silurian regions erratics\r\nof Old Red Sandstone rocks which have come from the east or south-east;\r\nwhile the abundant presence of erratics of Silurian origin, on the\r\nother hand, bespeak an ice-flow from the west towards the low-grounds.\r\nIn some places within the Silurian area we encounter a greyish-blue\r\nboulder-clay containing Silurian fragments only, while in other places\r\nwithin the same area the boulder-clay becomes reddish, and is charged\r\nwith many boulders of Old Red Sandstone rocks. Now the greyish-blue\r\ntill could only have been laid down by glacier-ice descending from\r\nthe Silurian high-grounds to Strathmore, while the red boulder-clay\r\npoints to a partial invasion of the Silurian regions by land-ice,\r\nwhich had previously traversed the lower-lying Old Red Sandstone\r\nareas. These apparently contradictory movements are readily accounted\r\nfor by the former presence in the area of the North Sea of the great\r\nScandinavian _mer de glace_. Dr. James Croll was the first to point out\r\nthat the glacial phenomena of Caithness and the Shetlands could only\r\nbe accounted for by the advance of the Scandinavian ice-sheet towards\r\nour coasts, where it encountered and deflected the Scottish ice-sheet\r\nout of its normal course--a sagacious induction, which the admirable\r\nand exhaustive researches of my colleagues, Messrs. B. N. Peach and\r\nJ. Horne, have now firmly established. The lower blue boulder-clay\r\nwas evidently accumulated at a time when the Scottish ice was able\r\nto flow more or less directly east or south-east towards what is now\r\nthe coast-line; while the overlying red boulder-clay points to a\r\nsubsequent period when the presence of the Scandinavian _mer de glace_\r\nwas sufficiently great to compel the Scottish ice out of its normal\r\ncourse, and cause it to flow in a north-easterly direction. In doing\r\nso it now and again passed from tracts of Old Red Sandstone to invade\r\nthe Silurian area, and thus an overlying red boulder-clay was here and\r\nthere accumulated upon the surface of a greyish-blue till in which not\r\na single fragment of any Old Red Sandstone rock occurs.\r\n\r\nRecently Messrs. B. N. Peach and J. Horne, in a most instructive paper\r\non the \"Glaciation of Caithness,\"[S] have described some remarkable\r\ncomminglings of material which occur in a region where the glacial\r\nstriæ afford equally striking evidence of conflicting ice-movements.\r\nThese phenomena are developed here and there along a line which\r\nindicates the meeting-place of two rival ice-streams, on each side\r\nof which the boulder-clay presents different characteristics--the\r\none boulder-clay being the _moraine profonde_ of the ice that flowed\r\nENE. and NNE. towards the Caithness plain, while the other is an\r\naccumulation formed underneath the ice that streamed across that plain\r\nfrom SE. to NW. These phenomena are thus, as my colleagues remark,\r\nquite analogous to those met with in the middle districts of Scotland,\r\nas described by me, and referred to in a preceding paragraph. Now it\r\nis obvious that while these examples of \"intercrossings\" of erratics\r\nand \"cross-hatching\" of striæ all go strongly to support the land-ice\r\ntheory of the glacial phenomena, they at the same time negative the\r\nnotion of floating-ice having had anything to do with the production of\r\nthe phenomena under review.\r\n\r\n[S] _Proceedings Royal Physical Society_, Edinburgh, 1881.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the evidence adduced by Mr. Mackintosh and others\r\nas to the intercrossings of erratics in the drift-deposits of England,\r\nI shall mention some of the more remarkable examples of the same\r\nphenomena which have been noticed by continental geologists. The first\r\ncases I shall cite are those which have been observed in the glacial\r\naccumulations of the Rhone valley in eastern France. The land-ice\r\norigin of these accumulations has never been called in question, and\r\nas the intercrossings of erratics in that region are not only more\r\ncommon, but much more striking and apparently inexplicable than any\r\nwhich have been noticed elsewhere, it will be admitted that they of\r\nthemselves afford a strong presumption that the conflicting courses\r\nfollowed by the erratics in certain regions of our own country are\r\nthe result rather of oscillations in the flow of land-ice than of the\r\nrandom and eccentric action of icebergs. The researches of Swiss and\r\nFrench glacialists have proved that during the climax of the Glacial\r\nperiod an enormous area in the low-grounds of eastern France was\r\ncovered with a huge _mer de glace_, formed by the union of the great\r\nRhone glacier with the glaciers descending from the mountains of Savoy\r\nand Dauphiny. A line drawn from Bourg by way of Chatillon, Villeneuve,\r\nTrévoux, and Lyons to Vienne, and thence south-east by Beaurepaire to\r\nthe valley of the Isère, a few miles above St. Marcellin, indicates\r\nroughly the furthest limits reached by the _mer de glace_. Over all\r\nthe low-grounds between that terminal line and the mountains are found\r\nwidespread sheets of boulder-clay and sand and gravel, together with\r\nloose erratics. Now and again, too, well-marked terminal moraines make\r\ntheir appearance, while the rock-surfaces, when these are visible and\r\ncapable of bearing and retaining glacial markings, present the usual\r\naspect of _roches moutonnées_. The same kinds of morainic materials\r\nand ice-markings may of course be followed up into the valleys not\r\nonly of the Alps properly so-called, but also into those of the hills\r\nof Bugey and the secondary mountain-chain of Savoy and Dauphiny. It\r\nhas indeed long been known that local glaciers formerly occupied the\r\nmountain-valleys of Bugey. For example, a number of small glaciers have\r\ndescended from the slopes of the mountains west of Belley (such as Bois\r\nde la Morgue, Bois de Lind, etc.) to the Rhone, and again from Mont du\r\nChat to the north-west. These glaciers were quite independent of the\r\ngreater ice-streams of the neighbouring Alps of Savoy, and the same was\r\nthe case with the glaciers of that mountainous tract which extends from\r\nNantua south to Culoz, between the valleys of the Ain and the Rhone.\r\nFrom this elevated region many local glaciers descended, such as that\r\nof the Valromey, which flowed for a distance of some twenty miles from\r\nnorth to south. Again, similar local glaciers have left abundant traces\r\nof their former presence throughout the mountainous belt of land that\r\nstretches between Chambery and Grenoble to the west of the valley of\r\nthe Isère. The moraines of all those local glaciers, charged as they\r\nare with the débris of the neighbouring heights, clearly indicate that\r\nthe local glaciers flowed each down its own particular valley. There\r\nare certain other appearances, however, which seem at first sight to\r\ncontradict this view. Sometimes, for example, we encounter in the same\r\nvalleys erratics which do not belong to the drainage-system within\r\nwhich they occur, but have without doubt been derived from the higher\r\nAlps of Switzerland and Savoy. And the course followed by these foreign\r\nerratics has crossed at all angles that which the local glaciers have\r\ncertainly pursued--occasionally, indeed, the one set of erratics has\r\ntravelled in a direction exactly opposed to the trend taken by the\r\nothers. As examples, I may cite the case of the erratics which occur\r\nin Petit Bugey. In this district we encounter many locally-derived\r\nerratics which have come from Mont du Chat to the west of the Lac\r\ndu Bourget--that is to say, they have travelled in a north-westerly\r\ndirection. But in the same neighbourhood are found many erratics of\r\nAlpine origin which have been carried from north-east to south-west, or\r\nat right angles to the course followed by the local erratics. Again,\r\nin the valley of the Seran we have evidence in erratics and terminal\r\nmoraines of a local glacier which flowed south as far as the Lyons and\r\nGeneva Railway, in the neighbourhood of which, a few miles to the west\r\nof Culoz, its terminal moraines may be observed. This is the extinct\r\nGlacier du Valromey of MM. Falsan and Chantre. Now it is especially\r\nworthy of note that in the same valley we have distinct evidence of an\r\nice-flow from south to north--_i.e._, _up_ the valley. Erratics and\r\nmorainic materials which are unquestionably of Alpine origin have been\r\nfollowed a long way up the Seran valley--for two-thirds of its length\r\nat least. Before they could have entered that valley and approached the\r\nslopes of Romey, they must have travelled down the valley of the Rhone\r\nfrom the higher Alps of Savoy in a _south-west_ and _south_ direction\r\nuntil they rounded the Montagne du Grand Colombier. It was only after\r\nthey had rounded this massive mountain-ridge that they could pursue\r\ntheir course up the valley of the Seran, in a direction precisely\r\nopposite to that which they had previously followed. These and many\r\nsimilar and even more remarkable examples of the \"intercrossings\"\r\nof streams of erratics are described by MM. Falsan and Chantre, and\r\ngraphically portrayed in their beautiful and instructive work on the\r\n\"Ancient Glaciers and Erratic Deposits of the Basin of the Rhone\"; and\r\nthe explanation of the phenomena given by them is extremely simple\r\nand convincing. The local erratics and moraines pertain partly to the\r\ncommencement and partly to the closing stage of the Glacial period.\r\nLong before the south branch of the great glacier of the Rhone had\r\nunited with the glacier of the Arve, and this last with the glaciers\r\nof Annecy and Beaufurt, and before these had become confluent with the\r\nglacier of the Isère, etc., the secondary mountain-ranges of Savoy and\r\nDauphiny and the hills of Bugey were covered with very considerable\r\nsnow-fields, from which local glaciers descended all the valleys to the\r\nlow-ground. But when the vast ice-flows of Switzerland, Upper Savoy,\r\netc., at last became confluent, they completely overflowed many of the\r\nhilly districts which had formerly supported independent snow-fields\r\nand glaciers, and deposited their bottom-moraines over the morainic\r\ndébris of the local glaciers. In other cases, where the secondary\r\nhill-ranges were too lofty to be completely drowned in the great _mer\r\nde glace_, long tongues of ice dilated into the valleys, and compelled\r\nthe local ice out of its course; sometimes, as in the case of the\r\nValromey, forcing it backward up the valleys down which it formerly\r\nflowed. But when once more the mighty _mer de glace_ was on the wane,\r\nthen the local glaciers came again into existence, and reoccupied\r\ntheir old courses. And thus it is that in the hilly regions at the\r\nbase of the higher Alps, and even out upon the low-grounds and plains,\r\nwe encounter that remarkable commingling of erratics which has been\r\ndescribed above. Not infrequently, indeed, we find one set of moraines\r\nsuperposed upon another, just as in the low-grounds of northern\r\nGermany, etc., we may observe one boulder-clay overlying another, the\r\nerratics in which give evidence of transport in different directions.\r\nThe observations recorded by MM. Falsan and Chantre, and their\r\ncolleagues, thus demonstrate that \"intercrossings\" of erratics of the\r\nmost pronounced character have been brought about solely by the action\r\nof glaciers. In the case of the erratics and morainic accumulations of\r\nthe basin of the Rhone, the action of icebergs is entirely precluded.\r\n\r\nI may now mention some of the more remarkable examples of\r\nintercrossings of erratics which have been recorded from the glacial\r\naccumulations of north Germany, etc. An examination of the glacial\r\nstriæ, _roches moutonnées_, and boulder-clays of Saxony leads to\r\nthe conviction, according to Credner, Penck, Torell, Helland, and\r\nothers, that the whole of that region has been invaded by the great\r\nScandinavian _mer de glace_ which flowed into Saxony from NNE. to SSW.\r\nErratics from southern Sweden and Gothland occur in the boulder-clay,\r\nand the presence of these, taken in connection with the direction\r\nof the glaciation, leaves us no alternative but to agree with the\r\nconclusions arrived at by the Saxon geologists. But, apparently\r\nin direct contradiction of this conclusion, we have evidence to\r\nshow that boulders of the same kinds of rock occur in Denmark and\r\nHolland, pointing to a former ice-flow from north-east to south-west\r\nand west. Thus boulders derived from Gothland occur at Gröningen\r\nin Holland, while fragments from the island of Öland are met with\r\nin Faxö; and erratics from the borders of the Gulf of Finland are\r\nencountered at Hamburg. Indeed, when geologists come to examine the\r\nerratics in north Germany and Poland generally, they find evidence of\r\napparently two ice-flows--one of which went south-south-west, south,\r\nand south-east--spreading out, as it were, in a fan-shape towards the\r\nsouthern limits reached by the great \"Northern Drift,\"--while the other\r\nseems to have followed the course of the Baltic depression, overflowing\r\nthe low-grounds of northern Prussia, Holland, etc., in a south-west and\r\nwest direction. Now, it is quite evident that no one _mer de glace_\r\ncould have followed these various directions at one and the same time.\r\nThe explanation of the apparent anomaly, however, is not far to seek.\r\nIt is reasonable to infer that long before the _mer de glace_ had\r\nattained its maximum dimensions, when as yet it was confined to the\r\nbasin of the Baltic and was only able to overflow the northern regions\r\nof Prussia, etc., its course would be determined by the contour of the\r\npavement upon which it advanced. It would, therefore, be compelled\r\nto follow the Baltic depression, and for a long time it would carry\r\nerratics from Finland, the Baltic islands, and eastern Sweden in a\r\nsouth-west and west-south-west direction. And this would continue to\r\nbe the direction even after a considerable portion of the low-grounds\r\nof Prussia, etc., had been overflowed. But when the ice-sheet was\r\nenabled to advance south into Saxony, Poland, and Lithuania, erratics\r\nfrom Finland, the Baltic islands, etc., would necessarily cease to\r\ntravel towards the west, and hold on a south-south-east, south, and\r\nsouth-south-west course. Again, when the _mer de glace_ was on the\r\ndecline, a time would return when the ice, as before, would be\r\ncontrolled in its flow by the Baltic depression, and this would give\r\nrise to a further distribution of erratics in a prevalent west-by-south\r\ndirection.[T]\r\n\r\n[T] For a fuller discussion of the distribution of erratics on\r\nthe Continent, I may refer to Appendix, Note B, in _Prehistoric\r\nEurope_, where the reader will find references to the literature of\r\nthis interesting subject. [Continental geologists now recognise a\r\ndistinct stage of the Ice Age, during which their \"Upper Diluvium\" was\r\ndeposited by a great glacier that occupied the basin of the Baltic.\r\nThis \"Great Baltic Glacier\" appears to have been contemporaneous with\r\nthe local ice-sheets and valley-glaciers of the Highlands and other\r\nmountain-tracts of our island. See Article X. 1892.]\r\n\r\nNo one of late years has been more assiduous in the collection of facts\r\nrelating to the intercrossing of erratics in the drift-deposits of\r\nEngland than Mr. D. Mackintosh.[U] He has written many instructive and\r\ninteresting descriptions of the phenomena in question, which he justly\r\nthinks are of prime importance from a theoretical point of view. In a\r\nrecent paper[V] he presents us with the results of a systematic survey\r\nof the direction and limits of dispersion of the erratics of the west\r\nof England and east of Wales, which he evidently is of opinion afford\r\nstrong support to the iceberg theory, while at the same time they\r\nare directly opposed to the theory of transport by land-ice. I have\r\nattentively considered all the arguments advanced by Mr. Mackintosh in\r\nfavour of his views--the one upon which he apparently lays most stress\r\nbeing that of the intercrossings of erratics observed by him--and I\r\nshall now proceed to point out how the phenomena described by him are\r\nmost satisfactorily explained by the land-ice theory. They seem to\r\nme, indeed, to lend additional support to that theory, in the same\r\nmanner as the intercrossings of boulders observed in Scotland, northern\r\nGermany, etc., and sub-alpine regions of France. Mr. Mackintosh calls\r\nattention to the fact that erratics of the well-known Criffel granite\r\nare found scattered over a large part of the plain of Cumberland,\r\nfrom which they extend south along the coast to near the mouth of the\r\nestuary of the Duddon. They reappear on the coast in the neighbourhood\r\nof Blackpool and Liverpool, and again at intervals on the coasts of\r\nnorth Wales from Flint to Colwyn Bay, and thence to Penmaenmawr and\r\nthe neighbourhood of Beaumaris. They are dispersed over the peninsula\r\nof Wirral and the Cheshire plain, etc., and they have been followed\r\nsouth-east as far as the neighbourhood of Cardington, near Church\r\nStretton, Burton, Wolverhampton, Stafford, Hare Castle, Macclesfield,\r\nand Manchester. This great stream of boulders, therefore, spreads\r\nout to south-east, south, and south-west: the erratics, to quote\r\nMr. Mackintosh, \"have radiated from an area much smaller than their\r\nterminal breadth.\" The same is the case, I may remark in passing, with\r\nerratics in the boulder-clays of Scotland, Scandinavia, north Germany,\r\netc., as also with those in the drift-deposits of the great Rhone\r\nglacier and other ancient glaciers both on the north and south side of\r\nthe Alps. Now, the course followed by the Criffel erratics is crossed\r\nat an acute angle by the path pursued by many boulders of Eskdale\r\ngranite, and various felspathic rocks derived from the Cumberland\r\nmountains. For example, Cumberland erratics of the kinds mentioned\r\noccur near St. Asaph and Moel-y-Tryfane and in Anglesey, and they\r\nhave been followed over a wide district in Cheshire, etc., extending\r\nas far south as Church Stretton and Wolverhampton, and as far east as\r\nRochdale. More than this, we find that numerous erratics of felstone,\r\nderived from the mountain of Great Arenig, in north Wales, have gone\r\nto north-east as far as Halkin Mountain, in Flintshire, Eryrys, near\r\nLlanarmon, and Chirk, from which last-named place they have been traced\r\nin a south-easterly direction to Birmingham, Bromsgrove, etc. A glance\r\nat the map of England will show that this south-easterly drift of\r\nerratics crosses at an acute angle the paths followed by the Criffel\r\ngranite boulders and the erratics derived from Cumberland, so that we\r\nhave now several intercrossings to account for. How can this be done by\r\nthe land-ice theory?\r\n\r\n[U] This enthusiastic geologist died in 1891.\r\n\r\n[V] _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. xxxv. p. 425\r\n\r\nThe explanation seems to me obvious, for the phenomena are, after all,\r\nless striking than similar appearances which have been observed in\r\nScotland, especially by my colleagues, Messrs. Peach and Horne, in\r\nCaithness and the Orkney and Shetland Islands; and they are certainly\r\nless intricate than the facts recorded by MM. Falsan and Chantre\r\nconcerning the intercrossing, interosculation, and direct opposition\r\nof erratic paths in Savoy and Dauphiny. We have only to reflect that\r\nthe great _mer de glace_--to which, as I believe, all the English\r\nphenomena are due--did not come into existence and attain its maximum\r\ndimensions in the twinkling of an eye, nor could it afterwards have\r\ndisappeared in the same sudden manner. On the contrary, a period\r\nof local glaciation must have preceded the appearance of the great\r\nice-sheet. At first, and for a long time, permanent snow would be\r\nconfined to the higher elevations of the land, and glaciers would\r\nbe limited to mountain-valleys; but as the temperature fell the\r\nsnow-line would gradually descend, until at last, probably after a\r\nprolonged period, it reached what is now the sea-level. Thus the\r\nformation of _névé_ and glacier-ice would eventually take place over\r\nwhat are now our low-grounds, and other tracts also, which are now\r\nsubmerged. It is quite impossible that the vast sheets of ice which\r\ncan be demonstrated to have covered Scotland, a large part of England,\r\nIreland, Scandinavia, and north Germany, and even the limited area of\r\nthe Faröe Islands, could possibly have been fed by the snow-fields of\r\nmountain-heights only. The precipitation and accumulation of snow, and\r\nthe formation of _névé_ and glacier-ice, must have taken place over\r\nenormous regions in what are now the temperate latitudes of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the direction of ice-flow in the basin of the Irish\r\nSea opposite the south of Scotland and the west of England, while\r\npreserving a general southerly trend, would vary at different periods.\r\nBefore the _mer de glace_ in that basin had attained its climax there\r\nmust have been a time when the ice, streaming outwards from the\r\nhigh-grounds of Cumberland, was enabled to push its way far westward\r\nout into the basin of the Irish Sea. At that time it was still able\r\nto hold its own against the pressure exerted by the Scottish ice. But\r\nas the general _mer de glace_ increased in thickness, the course of\r\nthe Cumberland ice would be diverted ever further and further to the\r\nsouth-east, until, eventually, the Scottish ice came to hug the coast\r\nof Cumberland, and to overflow Lancashire in its progress towards the\r\nsouth-east. So gorged with ice did the basin of the Irish Sea become,\r\nthat a portion of the Scottish ice was forced over the plain of\r\nCumberland and up the valley of the Eden, where it coalesced with the\r\nice coming north from the Shap district, and thereafter flowed in an\r\neasterly direction to join the great _mer de glace_ of the North Sea\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\nThus the intercrossings of the Criffel and Cumberland erratics\r\ndescribed by Mr. Mackintosh receive a ready explanation by the land-ice\r\ntheory. Nor do the intercrossings of the Welsh erratics with those\r\nderived from Scotland and Cumberland offer any difficulty. The ice\r\ncoming from the Welsh mountains would naturally be deflected towards\r\nsouth-east by the _mer de glace_ that streamed in that direction, and\r\nmight quite well have carried its characteristic boulders as far as\r\nBirmingham before the general _mer de glace_ had attained its greatest\r\ndimensions. But when that period of maximum glaciation arrived, the\r\nWelsh boulders would be unable to travel so far towards the east, and\r\nthe Scottish and Cumberland boulders would then cross the path formerly\r\nfollowed by the felstone erratics from Great Arenig.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is evident that when the _mer de glace_ was gradually\r\ndecreasing similar oscillations of the ice-flow would take place,\r\nbut in reverse order, and thus would give rise to a second series of\r\nintercrossings. Moreover, we must remember that the Glacial period\r\nwas characterised by several great changes of climate. It was not one\r\ncontinuous and prolonged period of cold conditions, but consisted\r\nrather of a succession of arctic and genial climates; so that the same\r\ncountries were overrun at different epochs by successive _mers de\r\nglace_, each of which would rework, denude, and redistribute to a large\r\nextent the morainic materials of its predecessor, and thus might well\r\ncause even greater complexity in the dispersion of erratics than has\r\nyet been recognised anywhere in these islands.\r\n\r\nMr. Mackintosh refers to the occurrence of chalk-flints and Lias\r\nfossils associated with northern erratics in the drift-deposits of\r\nthe west of England, the presence of which, he thinks, is fatal to\r\nthe theory of transport by land-ice. Thus, he says, chalk-flints,\r\netc., have been met with at Lillieshall (east of Wellington), at\r\nStrethill (near Ironbridge), at Seisdon (between Wolverhampton and\r\nBridgenorth), at Wolverhampton, near Stafford, and near Bushbury.\r\nChalk-flints have also been found as far west as Malvern and Hatfield\r\nCamp, south of Ledbury. All these erratics have crossed England from\r\nthe east, according to Mr. Mackintosh and other observers. Not only\r\nso, but, as Mr. Mackintosh remarks, those found at Wolverhampton,\r\nBirmingham, etc., \"must have _crossed the course_ of the northern\r\nboulders near its southerly termination.\" And since both northern and\r\neastern erratics are found associated in the same drift-deposit, it\r\nseems to him \"impossible to explain the intercrossing by land-ice or\r\nglaciers.\" Now, on the contrary, those eastern erratics are scattered\r\nover the very districts where I should have expected to find them. The\r\nobservations of geologists in East Anglia have shown that that region\r\nhas been invaded by the _mer de glace_ of the North Sea basin.[W]\r\nThis remarkable glacial invasion is proved not only by the direction\r\nfollowed by stones of local derivation, and by boulders which have come\r\nsouth from Scotland and the northern counties, but by the occurrence\r\nin the boulder-clay at Carnelian Bay and Holderness of erratics of\r\ncertain well-known Norwegian rocks, which have been recognised by\r\nMr. Amund Helland. The occurrence of chalk-flints and fragments of\r\nOolitic rocks in the neighbourhoods mentioned by Mr. Mackintosh thus\r\nonly affords additional evidence in favour of the land-ice origin of\r\nthe drift-deposits described by him. The _mer de glace_ that flowed\r\ndown the east coast of England seems to have encroached more and more\r\nupon the land, until eventually it swept over the low-lying Midlands\r\nin a south-westerly direction, and coalesced with the _mer de glace_\r\nthat streamed inland from the basin of the Irish Sea, and the ice that\r\nflowed outwards from the high-grounds of Wales. The united ice-stream\r\nwould thereafter continue on its south-westerly course down the Severn\r\nvalley to the Bristol Channel. I have no doubt that Mr. Mackintosh will\r\nyet chronicle the occurrence of chalk-flints and other eastern erratics\r\nfrom localities much further to the south than Ledbury.\r\n\r\n[W] See Mr. Skertchly's description of East Anglian deposits in _Great\r\nIce Age_, 2nd edit., p. 358.\r\n\r\nAgain, considerable stress has been laid by Mr. Mackintosh upon the\r\noccurrence of chalk-flints in the drift-deposits of Blackpool, Dawpool,\r\nParkgate, Halkin Mountain, Wrexham, the peninsula of Wirral, Runcorn,\r\nDelamere, Crewe, Leylands, Piethorne (near Rochdale), and other places.\r\n\"All these flints,\" Mr. Mackintosh remarks, \"belong to the basin of the\r\nIrish Sea, and have almost certainly crossed the general course of the\r\nnorthern boulders on their way from Ireland.\" Here, unfortunately, the\r\nIrish Sea intervenes to conceal the evidence that is needed to enable\r\nus to track the exact path followed by the erratics in question. I am\r\nnot so certain as Mr. Mackintosh that the chalk-flints he refers to\r\ncame from the north of Ireland. Chalk-flints occur pretty numerously in\r\nthe drift-deposits in the maritime districts of north-eastern Scotland,\r\nwhich we have every reason to believe have been derived from an area\r\nof Cretaceous rocks covering the bottom of the adjacent sea; and for\r\naught one can say to the contrary, patches of chalk-with-flints may\r\noccur in like manner in the bed of the Irish Sea. I cannot at present\r\nremember whether any boulders of the basalt-rocks, which are associated\r\nwith the Chalk in the north of Ireland, have been recognised in the\r\ndrifts of the west of England; but if the chalk-flints really came from\r\nAntrim, it is more than probable that they would be accompanied by\r\nfragments of the hard igneous rocks which overlie the Cretaceous strata\r\nof north Ireland. Chalk and chalk-flints occur in the boulder-clay of\r\nthe Isle of Man, where they are associated, Mr. Horne tells us, with\r\nCriffel granite and fragments of a dark trap-rock.[X] Possibly these\r\nlast are basalt-rocks from Antrim. It seems reasonable, therefore,\r\nto believe that erratics of Irish origin have found their way to the\r\nIsle of Man; and if this be so, it may be permissible to assume that\r\nthe chalk-flints of Blackpool, etc. (and perhaps also some of the\r\nbasalt-rocks), have come from the same quarter. Mr. Horne has no doubt\r\nthat the Irish erratics were brought to the Isle of Man by land-ice.\r\nReferring to the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Close that the Irish _mer\r\nde glace_ \"was probably not less than 3000 feet in depth,\" he remarks:\r\n\"It is highly probable that this great mass of Irish ice succeeded,\r\nafter a hard battle (_i.e._, with the Scottish ice-sheet), in reaching\r\nthe Manx coast-line. It is not to be supposed that the normal momentum\r\nof the respective ice-sheets remained constant. The moving force must\r\nhave varied with changing conditions. On the other hand, it is quite\r\npossible that there may have been an 'under-tow' of the ice from the\r\nnorth-east coast of Ireland, which would easily account for Antrim\r\nchalk and chalk-flints in the Manx till.\" I would go further, and state\r\nmy conviction that before the united ice-sheets had attained their\r\nmaximum development, it is almost certain that the ice flowing into the\r\nIrish Sea basin by the North Channel would for a long time exceed in\r\nmass the coalescent glaciers that descended from the Southern Uplands\r\nof Scotland, and would therefore be enabled to extend much further to\r\nthe east than it could at a later date, when the general _mer de glace_\r\nhad reached its climax. It might thus have advanced as far as and even\r\nbeyond the Isle of Man. This inference is based upon the simple fact\r\nthat the area drained by the _mer de glace_ of the North Channel was\r\nvery much greater than the area extending from the watershed of the\r\nSouthern Uplands of Scotland to the Isle of Man. Erratics from the\r\nnorth of Ireland would thus travel down the bed of the North Channel,\r\nand eventually be distributed over a wide area up to and possibly even\r\nsome distance beyond the Isle of Man. But as the Scottish and Cumbrian\r\nice-flows gradually increased in importance, the _mer de glace_ coming\r\nfrom the North Channel would be forced further and further to the west,\r\nuntil the ice-flow issuing from the high-grounds of Kirkcudbright at\r\nlast succeeded in reaching the middle of the Irish Sea basin. This\r\ngradual modification of the general ice-flow in that basin would of\r\ncourse give rise to a redistribution of the ground-moraine, and the\r\nIrish erratics would then travel onwards underneath the Scottish ice,\r\nand eventually reach the low-grounds of Lancashire and Cheshire,\r\nalong with erratics from Criffel and the Cumbrian mountains. It is,\r\ntherefore, quite unnecessary to suppose that the _mer de glace_ of\r\nthe North Channel actually crossed the whole breadth of the basin of\r\nthe Irish Sea to invade Lancashire, Cheshire, and north Wales. Had\r\nthis been the case, chalk-flints, chalk, and many other kinds of rock\r\nderived from the north of Ireland, and even from Arran and Argyll,\r\nwould have abounded in the drifts of the west of England. Erratics\r\ncoming from Ireland could not possibly have travelled underneath\r\nIrish ice further east than the Isle of Man. There or thereabouts, as\r\nI have said, the _mer de glace_ of the North Channel would begin to\r\nencounter the ice streaming down from the uplands of Galloway and the\r\nmountains of Cumberland: and as the ice from these quarters increased\r\nin thickness, it would gradually override what had formerly been the\r\nbottom-moraine or till of the North Channel _mer de glace_. Thus Irish\r\nerratics would become commingled with erratics from Criffel, etc., and\r\nbe carried forward in a southerly and south-easterly direction. The\r\nchalk-flints in the drifts of Lancashire, Cheshire, etc., are probably\r\ntherefore _remaniés_--the relics of the bottom-moraine of the North\r\nChannel _mer de glace_ rearranged and redistributed. And this is why\r\nthey and other Irish rocks are so comparatively rare in the glacial\r\naccumulations of the west of England.\r\n\r\n[X] _Trans. Edin. Geol. Soc._, vol. ii., 1874.\r\n\r\nThus all the instances of intercrossings adduced by Mr. Mackintosh\r\nas favouring the iceberg theory, and condemning its rival, I would\r\ncite as proving exactly the opposite. So far from presenting any real\r\ndifficulty to an upholder of the land-ice theory, they, in point of\r\nfact, as I have already remarked, lend that view additional support.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to criticise all the arguments and reasons\r\nadvanced by Mr. Mackintosh in favour of his special views, but I may be\r\nallowed a few remarks on the somewhat extraordinary character of the\r\nagents which, according to him, were mainly instrumental in producing\r\nthe drift-phenomena of western England. Before doing so, however, I\r\nmay point out that, in ascribing the transport of erratics in that\r\nregion (and, by implication, the formation of the boulder-clays, etc.,\r\nwith which most of these erratics are associated) to floating-ice and\r\nsea-currents, Mr. Mackintosh has failed to furnish us with any \"fossil\r\nevidence\" to show that western England was under water at the time\r\nthe boulder-clays and erratics were being accumulated. He speaks of\r\ncold and warm currents, but where do we find any traces of the marine\r\norganisms which must have abounded in those waters? Where are the\r\nraised sea-beaches which must have marked the retreat of the sea? Where\r\ndo we encounter any organic relics that might help us to map out the\r\nzones of shallow and deep water? The sea-shells, etc., which occur in\r\nthe boulder-clays are undeniably _remaniés_; they are erratics just\r\nas much as the rock-fragments with which they are associated. Similar\r\nassemblages of organic remains are met with in the till of Caithness,\r\nwhere shallow-water and deep-sea shells, and shells indicative of\r\ngenial and again of cold conditions, are all confusedly distributed\r\nthroughout one and the same deposit. The same or analogous facts are\r\nencountered in the _Blocklehm_ of some parts of Prussia, marine and\r\nfreshwater shells occurring commingled in the boulder-clay. Nay,\r\neven in the _moraine profonde_ of the ancient Rhone glacier, broken\r\nand well-preserved shells of Miocene and Pliocene species appear\r\nenclosed in the tumultuous accumulation of clay, sand, and erratics.\r\nAnd precisely similar phenomena confront us in the glacial deposits\r\nof the neighbourhood of Lago Lugano. Mr. Mackintosh refers to the\r\nso-called \"stratification\" of the boulder-clay, as if that were a proof\r\nof accumulation in water. But a rude kind of bedding, generally marked\r\nby differences of colour, and sometimes by lines of stones, was the\r\ninevitable result of the sub-glacial formation of the boulder-clay.\r\nThe \"lines of bedding\" are due to the shearing of the clay under great\r\npressure, and may be studied in the boulder-clay of Switzerland and\r\nItaly, and in the till not only of the Lowlands but of the Highlands\r\nof Scotland. Occasionally the \"lines\" are so close that the clay\r\nsometimes presents the appearance of rude and often wavy and irregular\r\nlamination--a section of such a boulder-clay reminding one sometimes\r\nof that of a gnarled gneiss or crumpled schist. And these appearances\r\nmay be noted in boulder-clays which occupy positions that preclude\r\nthe possibility of their being marine--as in certain valleys of the\r\nHighlands, such as Strathbraan, and in the neighbourhood of Como, in\r\nItaly. This \"lamination\" is merely indicative of the intense pressure\r\nto which the till was subjected during its gradual accumulation under\r\nthe ice. It is assuredly not the result of aqueous action. Aqueous\r\nlamination is due to sifting and winnowing--the coarser or heavier\r\nand finer or lighter particles being separated in obedience to their\r\ndifferent specific gravity, and arranged in layers of more or less\r\nregularity according to circumstances. There is nothing of this kind of\r\narrangement, however, in the so-called stratified boulder-clay. If the\r\nclay of an individual lamina be washed and carefully sifted, it will be\r\nfound to be composed of grains of all shapes, sizes, and weights, down\r\nto the finest and most impalpable flour. It is impossible to believe\r\nthat such a heterogeneous assemblage of grains could have been dropt\r\ninto water without the particles being separated and sifted in their\r\nprogress to the bottom. Of course, every one knows that patches and\r\nbeds of laminated clay and sand of veritable aqueous origin occur now\r\nand again in boulder-clay. I suppose there is no boulder-clay without\r\nthem. I have seen them in the till of Italy and Switzerland, where\r\nthey show precisely the same features as the similar laminated clays in\r\nthe till of our own islands. But these included patches and beds point\r\nmerely to the action of sub-glacial waters, such as we know circulate\r\nunder the glaciers of the Alps, of Norway, and of Greenland.\r\n\r\nAgain, I would remark that Mr. Mackintosh has ignored all the evidence\r\nwhich has been brought forward from time to time to demonstrate\r\nthe sub-glacial origin of boulder-clay, and to prove the utter\r\ninsufficiency of floating-ice to account for the phenomena. And he\r\nadduces no new facts in support of the now discredited iceberg theory,\r\nunless it be his statement that _flat_ striated rock-surfaces (such\r\nas those near Birkenhead) have been caused by floating-ice--the\r\ndome-shaped _roches moutonnées_ being, on the other hand the work\r\nof land-ice. As a matter of personal observation, I can assure Mr.\r\nMackintosh that _flat_ striated surfaces are by no means uncommonly\r\nassociated in one and the same region with _roches moutonnées_.\r\nWhat are _roches moutonnées_ but the rounded relics of what were\r\nformerly rough uneven tors, projecting bosses, and prominent rocks?\r\nThe general tendency of glacial action is to reduce the asperities of\r\na land-surface; hence projecting points are rounded off, while flat\r\nsurfaces are simply, as a rule, planed smoother. Mr. Mackintosh might\r\ntraverse acres of such smoothed rock-surfaces in regions where the\r\nstrata are comparatively horizontal--for example, in the case of the\r\nbasaltic plateaux of the Faröes and of Iceland, which have certainly\r\nbeen glaciated by land-ice. Similar flat glaciated surfaces are met\r\nwith again and again both in the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland,\r\noccupying positions and associated with _roches moutonnées_ and till\r\nof such a character as to prove beyond any doubt that they no less\r\ncertainly are the result of the action of land-ice. But it is needless\r\nto discuss the probability or possibility of glaciation of any kind\r\nbeing due to floating-ice. We know that glaciers can and do polish and\r\nstriate rock-surfaces; no one, however, can say the same of icebergs:\r\nand until some one can prove to us that icebergs have performed this\r\nfeat, or can furnish us with well-considered reasons for believing\r\nthem to be capable of it, glacialists will continue sceptical.\r\n\r\nBut leaving these and other points which serve to show the\r\nweakness of the cause which Mr. Mackintosh supports with such keen\r\nenthusiasm, I may, in conclusion, draw attention to certain very\r\nremarkable theoretical views of his which seem to me to be not\r\nonly self-contradictory, but opposed to well-known natural laws.\r\nBriefly stated, his general view is that the erratics of the west\r\nof England have been distributed by floating-ice during a period of\r\nsubmergence--the scattering of erratics and the accumulation of the\r\nassociated glacial deposits having commenced at or about the time\r\nwhen the land began to sink, and continued until the submergence\r\nreached some 2000 feet below the present sea-level. In applying this\r\nhypothesis to explain the phenomena, Mr. Mackintosh makes rather free\r\nuse of sea-currents and winds. For example, he holds that a current\r\ncoming from Criffel carried with it boulder-laden ice which flowed\r\nsouth-west to the Isle of Man, south to north Wales, and south-east in\r\nthe direction of Blackpool and Manchester, Liverpool and Wolverhampton,\r\nDawpool and Church Stretton. Now, in the first place, it is very\r\nstrange that there is not a vestige or trace of any such submergence,\r\neither in the neighbourhood of Criffel itself or in the region to the\r\nnorth of it. The whole of that region has been striated and rubbed by\r\nland-ice coming down from the watershed of the Galloway mountains, to\r\nthe north of which the striæ, _roches moutonnées_, and tracks followed\r\nby erratics, indicate an ice-flow _towards_ the north-west, north,\r\nand north-east. It is, therefore, absolutely certain that at the time\r\nthe granite erratics are supposed to have sailed away from Criffel\r\non floating-ice, the whole of the Southern Uplands of Scotland were\r\ncovered with a great ice-field extending from Wigtown to Berwickshire;\r\nso that, according to Mr. Mackintosh's hypothesis, we should be forced\r\nto believe that an ocean-current originated in Criffel itself! But\r\nwaiving this and other insuperable objections which will occur to any\r\ngeologist who is familiar with the glacial phenomena of the south\r\nof Scotland, and confining myself to the evidence supplied by the\r\nEnglish drifts, I would remark that Mr. Mackintosh's hypothesis is not\r\nconsistent with itself. A current flowing in the direction supposed\r\ncould not possibly have permitted floating-ice to sail from Cumbria\r\nto the Isle of Man, to Moel-y-Tryfane and Colwyn Bay. Mr. Mackintosh\r\nadmits this himself, but infers that the transport of the Cumbrian\r\nerratics may have taken place at a different time. But how could this\r\nbe, seeing that the Criffel and Cumbrian erratics occur side by side\r\nin one and the same deposit? Again, the hypothesis of an ocean-current\r\ncoming from Criffel is inconsistent with the presence of the Irish\r\nchalk-flints in the drifts of the west of England. Did these also\r\ncome at a different time? And what about the dispersion of erratics\r\nfrom Great Arenig, which have gone north-east and north-north-east,\r\nalmost exactly in the face of the supposed Criffel current? Here an\r\nocean-current is obviously out of the question; and accordingly we are\r\ntold that this dispersion of Welsh boulders was probably the result\r\nof wind. But why should this wind have propelled the floating-ice so\r\nfar and no further in an easterly direction? Surely if floating-ice\r\nwas swept outwards from Great Arenig as far as Eryrys, bergs must\r\nhave been carried now and again much further to the east. And if they\r\ndid not sail eastwards, what became of them? Did they all melt away\r\nimmediately when they came into the ice-laden current that flowed\r\ntowards the south-east?[Y] A still greater difficulty remains. The\r\nCriffel and Cumbrian erratics suddenly cease when they are followed\r\nto the south, great quantities of them being accumulated over a belt\r\nof country extending from beyond Wolverhampton to Bridgenorth. What\r\nwas it that defined the southern limits of these northern boulders?\r\nIt is clear that it could not have been high-ground, for the Severn\r\nvalley, not to speak of low-lying regions further to the north-east,\r\nmust have been submerged according to Mr. Mackintosh's hypothesis.\r\nThere was therefore plenty of sea-room for the floating-ice to escape\r\nsouthwards. And yet, notwithstanding this, vast multitudes of bergs and\r\nfloes, as soon as they arrived at certain points, suddenly melted away\r\nand dropt their burdens! In what region under the sun does anything\r\nlike that happen at the present day? Mr. Mackintosh thinks that the\r\nmore or less sharply-defined boundary-line reached by the erratics\r\n\"could only have resulted from close proximity to a persistent current\r\nof water (or air?) sufficiently warm to melt the boulder-laden ice.\"\r\nHe does not tell us, however, where this warm current of water or\r\nair came from, or in what direction it travelled. He forgets some of\r\nhis own facts connected with the appearance of erratics of eastern\r\nderivation, and which, according to him, point to an ocean-current\r\nthat flowed across from Lincolnshire into the very sea in which the\r\nCriffel granite and Cumbrian boulders were being dropt. The supposed\r\nwarm ocean-current, then, if such it was rather than air, could hardly\r\nhave come from the east. Neither is it at all likely that it could\r\nhave come from the west, sheltered as the region of the Severn valley\r\nmust have been by the ice-laden mountains of Wales. Again, the south\r\nis shut to us; for there are no erratics in the south of England from\r\nwhich to infer a submergence of that district. If it be true that\r\nall the northern erratics which are scattered over the low-grounds\r\nof England, Denmark, Holland, Germany, Poland, and Russia, owe their\r\norigin to boulder-laden ice carried by ocean-currents, no such warm\r\nwater as Mr. Mackintosh desiderates could possibly have come from the\r\neast or south-east. We are left, then, to infer that the supposed warm\r\ncurrent[Z] must have flowed up the Severn valley directly in the face\r\nof the Criffel current, underneath which it suddenly plunged at a high\r\ntemperature, the line of junction between it and the cold water being\r\nsharply defined, and retaining its position unchanged for a long period\r\nof time! However absurd this conclusion may be, it is forced upon us if\r\nwe admit the hypothesis at present under review. For we must remember\r\nthat the floating-ice is supposed to have melted whenever it came into\r\ncontact with the warm current. The erratics occur up to a certain\r\nboundary-line, where they are concentrated in enormous numbers, and\r\nsouth of which they do not appear. Here, then, large and small floes\r\nalike must have vanished at once! Certainly a very extraordinary case\r\nof dissolution.\r\n\r\n[Y] Mr. Mackintosh says nothing about the \"carry\" or direction of the\r\nerratics in west and south Wales. Were the paths of these erratics\r\ndelineated upon a map, we should find it necessary to suppose that the\r\nwind- or sea-current by which the floating-ice was propelled had flowed\r\noutwards in all directions from the dominant heights!\r\n\r\n[Z] It must have likewise flowed in more or less direct opposition\r\nto the current which, in accordance with the iceberg hypothesis,\r\ntransported boulders southwards from the high-grounds of south Wales!\r\n\r\nIf we dismiss the notion of a warm ocean-current for that of a warm\r\nwind, we do not improve our position a whit. Where did the warm wind\r\ncome from? Not, certainly, from the ice-laden seas to the east. Are\r\nwe to suppose, then, that it flowed in from the south or south-west?\r\nIf so, we might well ask how it came to pass that in the immediate\r\nproximity of such a very warm wind as the hypothesis demands, great\r\nsnow-fields and glaciers were allowed to exist in Wales? Passing that\r\nobjection, we have still to ask how this wind succeeded in melting\r\nlarge and small masses of floating-ice with such rapidity that it\r\nprevented any of them ever trespassing south of a certain line? It is\r\nobvious that it must have been an exceedingly hot wind; and that, just\r\nas the hypothetical warm ocean-current must have suddenly dived under\r\nthe cold water coming from the north, so the hot wind, after passing\r\nover the surface of the sea until it reached a certain more or less\r\nwell-defined line, must have risen all at once and flowed vertically\r\nupwards into the cold regions above.\r\n\r\nThus, in seeking to escape from what he doubtless considers the\r\nerroneous and extravagant views of \"land-glacialists,\" Mr. Mackintosh\r\nadopts a hypothesis which lands him in self-contradictions and a\r\nperfect \"sea of troubles\"--a kind of chaos, in fact. In attempting to\r\nexplain the drifts of western England and east Wales he has ignored\r\nthe conditions that must have obtained in contiguous regions--thus\r\nforgetting that \"nothing in the world is single,\" and that one ought\r\nnot to infer physical conditions for one limited area without stopping\r\nto inquire whether these are in consonance with what is known of\r\nadjacent districts, or in harmony with the existing phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nI have so strongly opposed Mr. Mackintosh's explanation of the\r\nsudden termination of the northern erratics in the neighbourhood\r\nof Wolverhampton and elsewhere, that perhaps I ought to offer an\r\nexplanation of my own, that it may, in its turn, undergo examination.\r\nI labour under the disadvantage, however, of not having studied the\r\ndrifts in and around Wolverhampton, etc., and the suggestion which I\r\nshall throw out must therefore be taken for what it is worth. It seems\r\nto me, then, that the concentration of boulders in the neighbourhood\r\nof Wolverhampton, and the limits reached by the northern erratics\r\ngenerally, mark out, in all probability, the line of junction between\r\nthe _mer de glace_ coming from the basin of the Irish Sea and that\r\nflowing across the country from the vast _mer de glace_ that occupied\r\nthe basin of the German Ocean. Along this line the southerly transport\r\nof the northern boulders would cease, and here they would therefore\r\ntend to become concentrated. But it is most likely that now and again\r\nthey would get underneath the ice-flow that set down the Severn valley,\r\nand I should anticipate that they will yet be detected, along with\r\nerratics of eastern origin, as far south even as the Bristol Channel.\r\nIf it be objected to this view that erratics from Great Arenig have\r\nbeen met with south of Wolverhampton, at Birmingham and Bromsgrove,\r\nI would reply that these erratics were probably carried south either\r\nbefore or after the general _mer de glace_ had attained its climax--at\r\na period when the Welsh ice was able to creep out further to the east\r\nthan it could when the invasion of the North Sea ice was at its height.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this paper without expressing my admiration for the\r\nlong-continued and successful labours of the well-known geologist\r\nwhose views I have been controverting. Although I have entered my\r\nprotest against his iceberg hypothesis, and have freely criticised his\r\ntheoretical opinions, I most willingly admit that the practical results\r\nof his unwearied devotion to the study of those interesting phenomena\r\nwith which he is so familiar have laid all his fellow-workers under a\r\ndebt of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nRecent Researches in the Glacial Geology of the Continent.[AA]\r\n\r\n[AA] Presidential Address to the Geological Section of the British\r\nAssociation, Newcastle, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE President of this section must often have some difficulty in\r\nselecting a subject for his address. It is no longer possible to give\r\nan interesting and instructive summary of the work done by the devotees\r\nof our science during even one year. So numerous have the students of\r\ngeological science become--so fertile are the fields they cultivate--so\r\nabundant the harvests they reap, that one in my present position may\r\nwell despair of being able to take stock of the numerous additions to\r\nour knowledge which have accumulated within the last twelve months.\r\nNeither is there any burning question which at this time your President\r\nneed feel called upon to discuss. True, there are controversies that\r\nare likely to remain unsettled for years to come--there are still not a\r\nfew matters upon which we must agree to differ--we do not yet see eye\r\nto eye in all things geological. But experience has shown that as years\r\nadvance truth is gradually evolved, and old controversies die out, and\r\nso doubtless it will continue to be. The day when controversies shall\r\ncease, however, is yet, I hope, far in the future; for should that dull\r\nand unhappy time ever arrive, it is quite certain that mineralogists,\r\npetrologists, palæontologists, and geologists shall have died out of\r\nthe world. Following the example of many of my predecessors, I shall\r\nconfine my remarks to certain questions in which I have been specially\r\ninterested; and in doing so I shall endeavour to steer clear, as far\r\nas I can, of controversial matters. My purpose, then, is to give an\r\noutline of some of the results obtained during the last few years by\r\nContinental workers in the domain of glacial geology.\r\n\r\nThose who are not geologists will probably smile when they hear one\r\ndeclare that wielders of the hammer are extremely conservative--that\r\nthey are slow to accept novel views, and very tenacious of opinions\r\nwhich have once found favour in their eyes. Nevertheless, such is the\r\ncase, and well for us that it is so. However captivating, however\r\nimposing, however strongly supported by evidence a new view may appear\r\nto be, we do well to criticise, to sift the evidence, and to call for\r\nmore facts and experiments, if such are possible, until the proofs\r\nbecome so strong as to approach as near a demonstration as geologists\r\ncan in most cases expect such proofs to go. The history of our science,\r\nand indeed of most sciences, affords abundant illustration of what\r\nI say. How many long years were the views of sub-aërial erosion, as\r\ntaught by Hutton and Playfair, canvassed and controverted before\r\nthey became accepted! And even after their general soundness had\r\nbeen established, how often have we heard nominal disciples of these\r\nfathers of physical geology refuse to go so far as to admit that the\r\nriver-valleys of our islands have been excavated by epigene agents!\r\nIf, as a rule, it takes some time for a novel view to gain acceptance,\r\nit is equally true that views which have long been held are only with\r\ndifficulty discarded. Between the new and the old there is a constant\r\nstruggle for existence, and if the latter should happen to survive,\r\nit is only in a modified form. I have often thought that a history of\r\nthe evolution of geological theories would make a very entertaining\r\nand instructive work. We should learn from it, amongst other things,\r\nthat the advance of our science has not always been continuous--now\r\nand again, indeed, it has almost seemed as if the movement had been\r\nretrograde. Knowledge has not come in like an overwhelming flood--as\r\na broad majestic river--but rather like a gently-flowing tide, now\r\nadvancing, now retiring, but ever, upon the whole, steadily gaining\r\nground. The history I speak of would also teach us that many of\r\nthe general views and hypotheses which have been from time to time\r\nabandoned as unworkable, are hardly deserving of the reproach and\r\nridicule which we in these latter days may be inclined to cast upon\r\nthem. As the Scots proverb says: \"It is easy to be wise behindhand.\"\r\nIt could be readily shown that not a few discarded notions and\r\nopinions have frequently worked for good, and have rather stimulated\r\nthan checked inquiry. Such reflections should be encouraging to every\r\ninvestigator, whether he be a defender of the old or an advocate of the\r\nnew. Time tries all, and each worker may claim a share in the final\r\nestablishment of the truth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no department of geological inquiry that has given\r\nrise to more controversy than that which I have selected for the\r\nsubject of this address. Hardly a single step in advance has been\r\ntaken without vehement opposition. But the din of contending sides is\r\nnot so loud now--the dust of the conflict has to some extent cleared\r\naway, and the positions which have been lost or maintained, as the case\r\nmay be, can be readily discerned. The glacialist who can look back\r\nover the last twenty-five years of wordy conflict has every reason to\r\nbe jubilant and hopeful. Many of those who formerly opposed him have\r\ncome over to his side. It is true he has not had everything his own\r\nway. Some extreme views have been abandoned in the struggle; that of a\r\ngreat Polar ice-sheet, for example, as conceived of by Agassiz. I am\r\nnot aware, however, that many serious students of glacial geology ever\r\nadopted that view. But it was quite an excusable hypothesis, and has\r\nbeen abundantly suggestive. Had Agassiz lived to see the detailed work\r\nof these later days, he would doubtless have modified his notion and\r\ncome to accept the view of large continental glaciers which has taken\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by geologists who have been studying the\r\nperipheral areas of the drift-covered regions of our Continent,\r\nare such as to satisfy us that the drifts of those regions are not\r\niceberg-droppings, as we used to suppose, but true morainic matter\r\nand fluvio-glacial detritus. Geologists have not jumped to this\r\nconclusion--they have only accepted it after laborious investigation\r\nof the evidence. Since Dr. Otto Torell, in 1875, first stated his\r\nbelief that the Diluvium of north Germany was of glacial origin a\r\ngreat literature on the subject has sprung up, a perusal of which will\r\nshow that with our German friends glacial geology has passed through\r\nmuch the same succession of controversial phases as with us. At first\r\nicebergs are appealed to as explaining everything--next we meet with\r\nsundry ingenious attempts at a compromise between floating-ice and a\r\ncontinuous ice-sheet. As observations multiply, however, the element\r\nof floating-ice is gradually eliminated, and all the phenomena are\r\nexplained by means of land-ice and \"Schmelz-wasser\" alone. It is a\r\nremarkable fact that the iceberg hypothesis has always been most\r\nstrenuously upheld by geologists whose labours have been largely\r\nconfined to the peripheral areas of drift-covered countries. In the\r\nupland and mountainous tracts, on the other hand, that hypothesis has\r\nnever been able to survive a moderate amount of accurate observation.\r\nEven in Switzerland--the land of glaciers--geologists at one time\r\nwere of opinion that the boulder-clays of the low-grounds had a\r\ndifferent origin from those which occur in the mountain-valleys.\r\nThus, it was supposed that at the close of the Pleistocene period the\r\nAlps were surrounded by great lakes or by gulfs of some inland sea,\r\ninto which the glaciers of the high valleys flowed and calved their\r\nicebergs--these latter scattering erratics and earthy débris over\r\nthe drowned areas. Sartorius von Waltershausen[AB] set forth this\r\nview in an elaborate and well-illustrated paper. Unfortunately for\r\nhis hypothesis no trace of the supposed great lakes or the inland\r\nsea has ever been detected: on the contrary, the character of the\r\nmorainic accumulations, and the symmetrical grouping and radiation of\r\nthe erratics and perched blocks over the foot-hills and low-grounds,\r\nshow that these last have been invaded and overflowed by the glaciers\r\nthemselves. Even the most strenuous upholders of the efficacy of\r\nicebergs as originators of some boulder-clays, admit that the\r\nboulder-clay or till, of what we may call the inner or central region\r\nof a glaciated tract is the product of land-ice. Under this category\r\ncomes the boulder-clay of Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and of the\r\nAlpine Lands of central Europe, not to speak of the hilly parts of our\r\nown islands.\r\n\r\n[AB] \"Untersuchungen über die Klimate der Gegenwart und der Vorwelt,\"\r\netc.--_Natuurkundige Verhandelingen v. d. Holland. Maatsch. d.\r\nWetensch. te Haarlem_, 1865.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to study the drifts of the peripheral areas, it is\r\nnot difficult to see why these should be considered to have had a\r\ndifferent origin. They present certain features which, although not\r\nabsent from the glacial deposits of the inner region, are not nearly\r\nso characteristic of such upland tracts. I refer especially to the\r\nfrequent interstratification of boulder-clays with well-bedded deposits\r\nof clay, sand, and gravel; and to the fact that these boulder-clays are\r\noften less compressed than those of the inner region, and have even\r\noccasionally a silt-like character. Such appearances do seem at first\r\nto be readily explained on the assumption that the deposits have been\r\naccumulated in water opposite the margin of a continental glacier or\r\nice-sheet--and this was the view which several able investigators in\r\nGermany were for some time inclined to adopt.\r\n\r\nBut when the phenomena came to be studied in greater detail, and over\r\na wider area, this preliminary hypothesis did not prove satisfactory.\r\nIt was discovered, for example, that \"giants' kettles\"[AC] were more\r\nor less commonly distributed under the glacial deposits, and such\r\n\"kettles\" could only have originated at the bottom of a glacier. Again,\r\nit was found that pre-glacial accumulations were plentifully developed\r\nin certain places below the drift, and were often involved with the\r\nlatter in a remarkable way. The \"brown-coal formation\" in like manner\r\nwas violently disturbed and displaced, to such a degree that frequently\r\nthe boulder-clay is found to underlie it. Similar phenomena were\r\nencountered in regions where the drift overlies the Chalk--the latter\r\npresenting the appearance of having been smashed and shattered--the\r\nfragments having often been dragged some distance, so as to form a kind\r\nof friction-breccia underlying the drift, while large masses are often\r\nincluded in the clay itself. All the facts pointed to the conclusion\r\nthat these disturbances were due to tangential thrusting or crushing,\r\nand were not the result of vertical displacements, such as are produced\r\nby normal faulting, for the disturbances in question die out from above\r\ndownwards. Evidence of similar thrusting or crushing is seen in the\r\nremarkable faults and contortions that so often characterise the clays\r\nand sands that occur in the boulder-clay itself. The only agent that\r\ncould produce the appearances, now briefly referred to, is land-ice,\r\nand we must therefore agree with German geologists that glacier-ice\r\nhas overflowed all the drift-covered regions of the peripheral area.\r\nNo evidence of marine action in the formation of the stony clays is\r\nforthcoming--not a trace of any sea-beach has been detected. And yet,\r\nif these clays had been laid down in the sea during the retreat of\r\nthe ice-sheet from Germany, surely such evidence as I have indicated\r\nought to be met with. To the best of my knowledge the only particular\r\nfacts which have been appealed to, as proofs of marine action, are the\r\nappearance of bedded deposits in the boulder-clays, and the occasional\r\noccurrence in the clays themselves of a sea-shell. But other organic\r\nremains are also met with now and again in similar positions, such as\r\nmammalian bones and freshwater shells. All these, however, have been\r\nshown to be derivative in their origin--they are just as much erratics\r\nas the stones and boulders with which they are associated. The only\r\nphenomena, therefore, that the glacialist has to account for are the\r\nbedded deposits which occur so frequently in the boulder-clays of the\r\nperipheral regions, and the occasional silty and uncompressed character\r\nof the clays themselves.\r\n\r\n[AC] These appear to have been first detected by Professor Berendt and\r\nProfessor E. Geinitz.\r\n\r\nThe intercalated beds are, after all, not hard to explain. If\r\nwe consider for a moment the geographical distribution of the\r\nboulder-clays, and their associated aqueous deposits, we shall find\r\na clue to their origin. Speaking in general terms, the stony clays\r\nthicken out as they are followed from the mountainous and high-lying\r\ntracts to the low-grounds. Thus they are of inconsiderable thickness\r\nin Norway, the higher parts of Sweden, and in Finland, just as we find\r\nis the case in Scotland, northern England, Wales, and the hilly parts\r\nof Ireland. Traced south from the uplands of Scandinavia and Finland,\r\nthey gradually thicken out as the low-grounds are approached. Thus in\r\nsouthern Sweden they reach a thickness of 43 metres or thereabout,\r\nand of 80 metres in the northern parts of Prussia, while over the\r\nwide low-lying regions to the south they attain a much greater\r\nthickness--reaching in Holstein, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and west\r\nPrussia, a depth of 120 to 140 metres, and still greater depths in\r\nHanover, Mark Brandenburg, and Saxony. In those regions, however,\r\na considerable portion of the diluvium consists, as we shall see\r\npresently, of water-formed beds.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of the aqueous deposits, which are\r\nassociated with the stony clays, is somewhat similar. They are very\r\nsparingly developed in districts where the boulder-clays are thin. Thus\r\nthey are either wanting, or only occur sporadically in thin irregular\r\nbeds, in the high-grounds of northern Europe generally. Further\r\nsouth, however, they gradually acquire more importance, until in the\r\nperipheral regions of the drift-covered tracts they come to equal and\r\neventually to surpass the boulder-clays in prominence. These latter,\r\nin fact, at last cease to appear, and the whole bulk of the diluvium,\r\nalong the southern margin of the drift area, appears to consist of\r\naqueous accumulations alone.\r\n\r\nThe explanations of these facts advanced by German geologists\r\nare quite in accordance with the views which have long been held\r\nby glacialists elsewhere, and have been tersely summed up by Dr.\r\nJentzsch.[AD] The northern regions, he says, were the feeding-grounds\r\nof the inland-ice. In those regions melting was at a minimum, while the\r\ngrinding action of the ice was most effective. Here, therefore, erosion\r\nreached its maximum--ground-moraine or boulder-clay being unable to\r\naccumulate to any thickness. Further south melting greatly increased,\r\nwhile ground-moraine at the same time tended to accumulate--the\r\nconjoint action of glacier-ice and sub-glacial water resulting in\r\nthe complex drifts of the peripheral area. In the disposition and\r\nappearance of the aqueous deposits of the diluvium we have evidence\r\nof an extensive sub-glacial water-circulation--glacier-mills that\r\ngave rise to \"giants' kettles\"--chains of sub-glacial lakes in which\r\nfine clays gathered--streams and rivers that flowed in tunnels under\r\nthe ice, and whose courses were paved with sand and gravel. Nowhere\r\ndo German geologists find any evidence of marine action. On the\r\ncontrary, the dovetailing and interosculation of boulder-clay with\r\naqueous deposits are explained by the relation of the ice to the\r\nsurface over which it flowed. Throughout the peripheral area it did\r\nnot rest so continuously upon the ground as was the case in the inner\r\nregion of maximum erosion. In many places it was tunnelled by rapid\r\nstreams and rivers, and here and there it arched over sub-glacial\r\nlakes, so that accumulation of ground-moraine proceeded side by side\r\nwith the formation of aqueous sediments. Much of that ground-moraine\r\nis of the usual tough and hard-pressed character, but here and there\r\nit is somewhat less coherent and even silt-like. Now a study of the\r\nground-moraines of modern glaciers affords us a reasonable explanation\r\nof such differences. Dr. Brückner[AE] has shown that in many places the\r\nground-moraine of the Alpine glaciers is included in the bottom of\r\nthe ice itself. The ground-moraine, he says, frequently appears as an\r\nice-stratum abundantly impregnated with silt and rock-fragments--it is\r\nlike a conglomerate or breccia which has ice for its binding material.\r\nWhen this ground-moraine melts out of the ice--no running water being\r\npresent--it forms a layer of unstratified silt or clay, with stones\r\nscattered irregularly through it. Such being the case in modern\r\nglaciers, we can hardly doubt that over the peripheral areas occupied\r\nby the old northern ice-sheet boulder-clay must frequently have been\r\naccumulated in the same way. Nay, when the ground-moraine melted out\r\nand dropt here and there into quietly-flowing water it might even\r\nacquire in part a bedded character.\r\n\r\n[AD] _Jahrb. d. königl. preuss. geologischen Landesanstalt für 1884_,\r\np. 438.\r\n\r\n[AE] \"Die Vergletscherung des Salzachgebietes, etc.\": _Geographische\r\nAbhandlungen herausgegeben v. A. Penck_, Band i. Heft 1.\r\n\r\nThe limits reached by the inland-ice during its greatest extension are\r\nbecoming more and more clearly defined, although its southern margin\r\nwill probably never be so accurately determined as that of the latest\r\nepoch of general glaciation. The reasons for this are obvious. When\r\nthe inland-ice flowed south to the Harz and the hills of Saxony it\r\nformed no great terminal moraines. Doubtless many erratics and much\r\nrock-rubbish were showered upon the surface of the ice from the higher\r\nmountains of Scandinavia, but owing to the fanning-out of the ice on\r\nits southward march, such superficial débris was necessarily spread\r\nover a constantly-widening area. It may well be doubted, therefore,\r\nwhether it ever reached the terminal front of the ice-sheet in\r\nsufficient bulk to form conspicuous moraines. It seems most probable\r\nthat the terminal moraines of the great inland-ice would consist of\r\nlow banks of boulder-clay and aqueous materials-the latter, perhaps,\r\nstrongly predominating, and containing here and there larger and\r\nsmaller angular erratics which had travelled on the surface of the\r\nice. However that may be, it is certain that the whole region in\r\nquestion has been considerably modified by subsequent denudation, and\r\nto a large extent is now concealed under deposits belonging to later\r\nstages of the Pleistocene period. The extreme limits reached by the ice\r\nare determined rather by the occasional presence of rock-striæ and\r\n_roches moutonnées_, of boulder-clay and northern erratics, than by\r\nrecognisable terminal moraines. The southern limits reached by the old\r\ninland-ice appear in this way to have been tolerably well ascertained\r\nover a considerable portion of central Europe. Some years ago I\r\npublished a small sketch-map[AF] showing the extent of surface formerly\r\ncovered by ice. On this map I did not venture to draw the southern\r\nmargin of the ice-sheet in Belgium further south than Antwerp, where\r\nnorthern erratics were known to occur, but the more recent researches\r\nof Belgian geologists show that the ice probably flowed south for some\r\nlittle distance beyond Brussels.[AG] Here and there in other parts of\r\nthe Continent the southern limits reached by the northern drift have\r\nalso been more accurately determined, but, so far as I know, none of\r\nthese later observations involves any serious modification of the\r\nsketch-map referred to.\r\n\r\n[AF] _Prehistoric Europe_, 1881.\r\n\r\n[AG] See a paper by M. E. Delvaux: _Ann. de la. Soc. géol. de Belg._,\r\nt. xiii. p. 158.\r\n\r\nI have now said enough, however, to show that the notion of a general\r\nice-sheet having covered so large a part of Europe, which a few years\r\nago was looked upon as a wild dream, has been amply justified by the\r\nlabours of those who are so assiduously investigating the peripheral\r\nareas of the \"great northern drift.\" And perhaps I may be allowed\r\nto express my own belief that the drifts of middle and southern\r\nEngland, which exhibit the same complexity as the Lower Diluvium of\r\nthe Continent, will eventually be generally acknowledged to have had\r\na similar origin. I have often thought that whilst politically we are\r\nhappy in having the sea all round us, geologically we should have\r\ngained perhaps by its greater distance. At all events we should have\r\nbeen less ready to invoke its assistance to explain every puzzling\r\nappearance presented by our glacial accumulations.\r\n\r\nI now pass on to review some of the general results obtained by\r\ncontinental geologists as to the extent of area occupied by inland-ice\r\nduring the last great extension of glacier-ice in Europe. It is\r\nwell known that this latest ice-sheet did not overflow nearly so\r\nwide a region as that underneath which the lowest boulder-clay was\r\naccumulated. This is shown not only by the geographical distribution\r\nof the youngest boulder-clay, but by the direction of rock-striæ, the\r\ntrend of erratics, and the position of well-marked terminal moraines.\r\nGerard de Geer has given a summary[AH] of the general results obtained\r\nby himself and his fellow-workers in Sweden and Norway; and these have\r\nbeen supplemented by the labours of Berendt, E. Geinitz, Hauchecorne,\r\nKeilhack, Klockmann, Schröder, Wahnschaffe, and others in Germany, and\r\nby Sederholm in Finland.[AI] From them we learn that the end-moraines\r\nof the ice circle round the southern coasts of Norway, from whence\r\nthey sweep south-east by east across the province of Gottland in\r\nSweden, passing through the lower ends of Lakes Wener and Wetter, while\r\nsimilar moraines mark out for us the terminal front of the inland-ice\r\nin Finland--at least two parallel frontal moraines passing inland from\r\nHango Head on the Gulf of Finland through the southern part of that\r\nprovince to the north of Lake Ladoga. Further north-east than this\r\nthey have not been traced; but, from some observations by Helmersen,\r\nSederholm thinks it probable that the terminal ice-front extended\r\nnorth-east by the north of Lake Onega to the eastern shores of the\r\nWhite Sea. Between Sweden and Finland lies the basin of the Baltic,\r\nwhich at the period in question was filled with ice, forming a great\r\nBaltic glacier which overflowed the Öland Islands, Gottland, and Öland,\r\nand which, fanning-out as it passed towards the south-west, invaded, on\r\nthe south side, the Baltic provinces of Germany, while, on the north,\r\nit crossed the southern part of Scania in Sweden and the Danish islands\r\nto enter Jutland.\r\n\r\n[AH] _Zeitschrift d. deutsch. geolog.

No.\r\n7.\r\n\r\nThe upper boulder-clay of those regions is now recognised as the\r\nground-moraine of this latest ice-sheet. In many places it is separated\r\nfrom the older boulder-clay by interglacial deposits--some of which are\r\nmarine, while others are of freshwater and terrestrial origin. During\r\ninterglacial times the sea that overflowed a considerable portion of\r\nnorth Germany was evidently continuous with the North Sea, as is shown\r\nnot only by the geographical distribution of the interglacial marine\r\ndeposits, but by their North Sea fauna. German geologists generally\r\ngroup all the interglacial deposits together, as if they belonged to\r\none and the same interglacial epoch. This perhaps we must look upon\r\nas only a provisional arrangement. Certain it is that the freshwater\r\nand terrestrial beds which frequently occur on the same or a lower\r\nlevel, and at no great distance from the marine deposits, cannot in\r\nall cases be contemporaneous with the latter. Possibly, however, such\r\ndiscordances may be accounted for by oscillations in the level of the\r\ninterglacial sea--land and water having alternately prevailed over the\r\nsame area. Two boulder-clays, as we have seen, have been recognised\r\nover a wide region in the north of Germany. In some places, however,\r\nthree or more such boulder-clays have been observed overlying one\r\nanother throughout considerable areas, and these clays are described\r\nas being distinctly separate and distinguishable the one from the\r\nother.[AJ] Whether they, with their intercalated aqueous deposits,\r\nindicate great oscillations of one and the same ice-sheet--now\r\nadvancing, now retreating--or whether the stony clays may not be the\r\nground-moraines of so many different ice-sheets, separated the one from\r\nthe other by true interglacial conditions, future investigations must\r\nbe left to decide.\r\n\r\n[AJ] H. Schröder: _Jahrb. d. k. preuss. geol. Landesanstalt für 1887_ ,\r\np. 360.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusions arrived at by those who are at present\r\ninvestigating the glacial accumulations of northern Europe may be\r\nsummarised as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Before the invasion of northern Germany by the inland-ice the\r\nlow-grounds bordering on the Baltic were overflowed by a sea which\r\ncontained a boreal and arctic fauna. These marine conditions are\r\nindicated by the presence under the lower boulder-clay of more or\r\nless well-bedded fossiliferous deposits. On the same horizon occur\r\nalso beds of sand, containing freshwater shells, and now and again\r\nmammalian remains, some of which imply cold and others temperate\r\nclimatic conditions. Obviously all these deposits may pertain to one\r\nand the same period, or more properly to different stages of the\r\nsame period--some dating back to a time when the climate was still\r\ntemperate, while others clearly indicate the prevalence of cold\r\nconditions, and are therefore probably somewhat younger.\r\n\r\n2. The next geological horizon in ascending order is that which\r\nis marked by the Lower Diluvium--the glacial and fluvio-glacial\r\ndetritus of the great ice-sheet which flowed south to the foot of\r\nthe Harz Mountains. The boulder-clay on this horizon now and again\r\ncontains marine, freshwater, and terrestrial organic remains--derived\r\nundoubtedly from the so-called pre-glacial beds already referred\r\nto. These latter, it would appear, were ploughed up and largely\r\nincorporated with the old ground-moraine.\r\n\r\n3. The interglacial beds which next succeed contain remains of a\r\nwell-marked temperate fauna and flora, which point to something\r\nmore than a mere partial or local retreat of the inland-ice. The\r\ngeographical distribution of the beds, and the presence in these of\r\nsuch forms as _Elephas antiquus_, _Cervus elephas_, _C. megaceros_,\r\nand a flora comparable to that now existing in northern Germany,\r\njustify geologists in concluding that the interglacial epoch was one\r\nof long duration, and characterised in Germany by climatic conditions\r\napparently not less temperate than those that now obtain. One of the\r\nphases of that interglacial epoch, as we have seen, was the overflowing\r\nof the Baltic provinces by the waters of the North Sea.\r\n\r\n4. To this well-marked interglacial epoch succeeded another epoch of\r\narctic conditions, when the Scandinavian inland-ice once more invaded\r\nGermany, ploughing through the interglacial deposits, and working\r\nthese up in its ground-moraine. So far as I can learn, the prevalent\r\nbelief among geologists in north Germany is that there was only one\r\ninterglacial epoch; but, as already stated, doubt has been expressed\r\nwhether all the facts can be thus accounted for. There must always be\r\ngreat difficulty in the correlation of widely-separated interglacial\r\ndeposits, and the time does not seem to me to have yet come when we can\r\ndefinitely assert that all those interglacial beds belong to one and\r\nthe same geological horizon.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon the recent work of geologists in the peripheral areas\r\nof the drift-covered regions of northern Europe, because I think the\r\nresults obtained are of great interest to glacialists in this country.\r\nAnd for the same reason I wish next to call attention to what has been\r\ndone of late years in elucidating the glacial geology of the Alpine\r\nLands of central Europe--and more particularly of the low-grounds that\r\nstretch out from the foot of the mountains. Any observations that\r\ntend to throw light upon the history of the complex drifts of our own\r\nperipheral areas cannot but be of service. It is quite impossible to do\r\njustice in this brief sketch to the labours of the many enthusiastic\r\ngeologists who within recent years have increased our knowledge of the\r\nglaciation of the Alpine Lands. At present, however, I am not so much\r\nconcerned with the proofs of general glaciation as with the evidence\r\nthat goes to show how the Alpine ground-moraines have been formed,\r\nand with the facts which have led certain observers to conclude that\r\nthe Alps have endured several distinct glaciations within Pleistocene\r\ntimes. Swiss geologists are agreed that the ground-moraines which\r\nclothe the bottoms of the great Alpine valleys, and extend outwards\r\nsometimes for many miles upon the low-grounds beyond, are of true\r\nglacial origin. Now these ground-moraines are closely similar to the\r\nboulder-clays of this country and northern Europe--like them, they are\r\nfrequently tough and hard-pressed, but now and again somewhat looser,\r\nand less firmly coherent. Frequently also they contain lenticular\r\nbeds, and more or less thick sheets of aqueous deposits--in some places\r\nthe stony clays even exhibiting a kind of stratification--and ever and\r\nanon such water-assorted materials are commingled with stony clay in\r\nthe most complex manner. These latter appearances are, however, upon\r\nthe whole best developed upon the low-grounds that sweep out from the\r\nbase of the Alps. The only question concerning the ground-moraines\r\nthat has recently given rise to much discussion is the origin of the\r\nmaterials themselves. It is obvious that there are only three possible\r\nmodes in which those materials could have been introduced to the\r\nground-moraine: either they consist of superficial morainic débris\r\nwhich has found its way down to the bottom of the old glaciers by\r\ncrevasses; or they may be made up of the rock-rubbish, shingle, gravel,\r\netc., which doubtless strewed the valleys before these were occupied by\r\nice; or, lastly, they may have been derived in chief measure from the\r\nunderlying rocks themselves by the action of the ice that overflowed\r\nthem. The investigations of Penck, Blaas, Böhm, and Brückner appear to\r\nme to have demonstrated that the ground-moraines are composed mostly\r\nof materials which have been detached from the underlying rocks by\r\nthe erosive action of the glaciers themselves. Their observations\r\nshow that the regions studied by them in great detail were almost\r\ncompletely buried under ice--so that the accumulation of superficial\r\nmoraines was for the most part impossible; and they advance a number\r\nof facts which prove positively that the ground-moraines were formed\r\nand accumulated under ice. I cannot here recapitulate the evidence,\r\nbut must content myself by a reference to the papers in which this is\r\nfully discussed.[AK] These geologists do not deny that some of the\r\nmaterial may occasionally have come from above, nor do they doubt that\r\npre-existing masses of rock-rubbish and alluvial accumulations may also\r\nhave been incorporated with the ground-moraines; but the enormous\r\nextent of the latter, and the direction of transport and distribution\r\nof the erratics which they contain cannot be thus accounted for, while\r\nall the facts are readily explained by the action of the ice itself,\r\nwhich used its sub-glacial débris as tools with which to carry on the\r\nwork of erosion.\r\n\r\n[AK] Penck: _Die Vergletscherung der deutschen Alpen._ Blaas:\r\n_Zeitschrift d. Ferdinandeums_, 1885. Böhm: _Jahrb. d. k. k. geol.\r\nReichsanstalt_, 1885, Bd. xxxv., Heft 3. Brückner: _Die Vergletscherung\r\nd. Salzachgebietes, etc._, 1886.\r\n\r\nProfessor Heim and others have frequently asserted that glaciers\r\nhave little or no eroding power, since at the lower ends of existing\r\nglaciers we find no evidence of such erosion being in operation. But\r\nthe chief work of a glacier cannot be carried on at its lower end,\r\nwhere motion is reduced to a minimum, and where the ice is perforated\r\nby sub-glacial tunnels and arches, underneath which no glacial erosion\r\ncan possibly take place; and yet it is upon observations made in\r\njust such places that the principal arguments against the erosive\r\naction of glaciers have been based. If all that we could ever know of\r\nglacial action were confined to what we can learn from peering into\r\nthe grottoes at the terminal fronts of existing glaciers, we should\r\nindeed come to the conclusion that glaciers do not erode their rocky\r\nbeds to any appreciable extent. But as we do not look for the strongest\r\nevidence of fluviatile erosion at the mouth of a river, but in its\r\nvalley--and mountain-tracks, so if we wish to learn what glacier-ice\r\ncan accomplish, we must study in detail some wide region from which the\r\nice has completely disappeared. When this plan has been followed, it\r\nhas happened that some of the strongest opponents of glacial erosion\r\nhave been compelled by the force of the evidence to go over to the\r\nother camp. Dr. Blaas, for example, has been led by his observations\r\non the glacial formations of the Inn valley to recant his former\r\nviews, and to become a formidable advocate of the very theory which\r\nhe formerly opposed. To his work and the memoirs by Penck, Brückner,\r\nand Böhm already cited, and especially to the admirable chapter on\r\nglacier-erosion by the last-named author, I would refer those who may\r\nbe anxious to know the last word on this much-debated question.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of interglacial conditions within the Alpine lands\r\ncontinues to increase. These are represented by alluvial deposits of\r\nsilt, sand, gravel, conglomerate, breccia, and lignites. Penck, Böhm,\r\nand Brückner find evidence of two interglacial epochs, and maintain\r\nthat there have been three distinct and separate epochs of glaciation\r\nin the Alps. No mere temporary retreat and re-advance of the glaciers,\r\naccording to them, will account for the various phenomena presented by\r\nthe interglacial deposits and associated morainic accumulations. During\r\ninterglacial times the glaciers disappeared from the lower valleys\r\nof the Alps--the climate was temperate, and probably the snow-fields\r\nand glaciers approximated in extent to those of the present day. All\r\nthe evidence conspires to show that an interglacial epoch was of\r\nprolonged duration. Dr. Brückner has observed that the moraines of\r\nthe last glacial epoch rest here and there upon löss, and he confirms\r\nPenck's observations in south Bavaria that this remarkable formation\r\nnever overlies the morainic accumulations of the latest glacial epoch.\r\nAccording to Penck and Brückner, therefore, the löss is of interglacial\r\nage. There can be little doubt, however, that löss does not belong to\r\nany one particular horizon. Wahnschaffe[AL] and others have shown that\r\nthroughout wide areas in north Germany it is the equivalent in age of\r\nthe Upper Diluvium, while Schumacher[AM] points out that in the Rhine\r\nvalley it occurs on two separate and distinct horizons. Professor\r\nAndreæ has likewise shown[AN] that there is an upper and lower löss in\r\nAlsace--each characterised by its own special fauna.\r\n\r\n[AL] _Abhandl. z. geol. Specialkarte v. Preussen_, etc., Bd. vii. Heft\r\n1; _Zeitschr. d. Zeutsch. geol. Ges._, 1885, p. 904; 1886, p. 367.\r\n\r\n[AM] _Hygienische Topographie von Strassburg i. E._, 1885.\r\n\r\n[AN] _Abhandl. z. geol. Specialkarte a. Elsass-Lothringen_, Bd. iv.\r\nHeft 2.\r\n\r\nThere is still considerable difference of opinion as to the mode of\r\nformation of this remarkable accumulation. By many it is considered to\r\nbe an aqueous deposit; others, following Richthofen, are of opinion\r\nthat it is a wind-blown accumulation; while some incline to the\r\nbelief that it is partly the one and partly the other. Nor do the\r\nupholders of these various hypotheses agree amongst themselves as to\r\nthe precise manner in which water or wind has worked to produce the\r\nobserved results. Thus, amongst the supporters of the aqueous origin\r\nof the löss, we find this attributed to the action of heavy rains\r\nwashing over and rearranging the material of the boulder-clays.[AO]\r\nMany, again, have held it probable that löss is simply the finest loam\r\ndistributed over the low-grounds by the flood-waters that escaped from\r\nthe northern inland-ice and the _mers de glace_ of the Alpine lands of\r\ncentral Europe. Another suggestion is that much of the material of the\r\nlöss may have been derived from the denudation of the boulder-clays by\r\nflood-water, during the closing stages of the last cold period. It is\r\npointed out that in some regions, at least, the löss is underlaid by a\r\nlayer of erratics, which are believed to be the residue of the denuded\r\nboulder-clay. We are reminded by Klockmann[AP] and Wahnschaffe[AQ] that\r\nthe inland-ice must have acted as a great dam, and that wide areas\r\nin Germany, etc., would be flooded, partly by water derived from the\r\nmelting inland-ice, and partly by waters flowing north from the hilly\r\ntracts of middle Germany. In the great basins thus formed there would\r\nbe a commingling of fine silt material derived from north and south,\r\nwhich would necessarily come to form a deposit having much the same\r\ncharacter throughout.\r\n\r\n[AO] Laspeyres: _Erläuterungen z. geol Specialkaret v Preussen_, etc.,\r\n_Blatt. Gröbzig, Zörbig, und Petersberg_.\r\n\r\n[AP] Klockmann: _Jahrb. d. k. preuss. geol. Landesanstalt für 1883_, p.\r\n262.\r\n\r\n[AQ] Wahnschaffe: _Op. cit._, and _Zeitschr. d. deutsch. geol. Ges._,\r\n1886, p. 367.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have myself seen of the löss in various parts of Germany,\r\nand from all that I have gathered from reading and in conversation\r\nwith those who have worked over löss-covered regions, I incline to\r\nthe opinion that löss is for the most part of aqueous origin. In many\r\ncases this can be demonstrated, as by the occurrence of bedding and\r\nthe intercalation of layers of stones, sand, gravel, etc., in the\r\ndeposit; again, by the not infrequent appearance of freshwater shells;\r\nbut, perhaps, chiefly by the remarkable uniformity of character which\r\nthe löss itself displays. It seems to me reasonable also to believe\r\nthat the flood-waters of glacial times must needs have been highly\r\ncharged with finely-divided sediment, and that such sediment would be\r\nspread over wide regions in the low-grounds--in the slackwaters of the\r\ngreat rivers and in the innumerable temporary lakes which occupied,\r\nor partly occupied, many of the valleys and depressions of the land.\r\nThere are different kinds of löss or löss-like deposits, however,\r\nand all need not have been formed in the same way. Probably some may\r\nhave been derived, as Wahnschaffe has suggested, from denudation of\r\nboulder-clay. Possibly also, some löss may owe its origin to the\r\naction of rain on the stony clays, producing what we in this country\r\nwould call \"rain-wash.\" There are other accumulations, however, which\r\nno aqueous theory will satisfactorily explain. Under this category\r\ncomes much of the so-called _Berglöss_, with its abundant land-shells,\r\nand its generally unstratified character. It seems likely that such\r\nlöss is simply the result of sub-aërial action, and owes its origin\r\nto rain, frost, and wind acting upon the superficial formations, and\r\nrearranging their finer-grained constituents. And it is quite possible\r\nthat the upper portion of much of the löss of the lower-grounds may\r\nhave been re-worked in the same way. But I confess I cannot yet find in\r\nthe facts adduced by German geologists any evidence of a dry-as-dust\r\nepoch having obtained in Europe during any stage of the Pleistocene\r\nperiod. The geographical position of our Continent seems to me to\r\nforbid the possibility of such climatic conditions, while all the\r\npositive evidence we have points to humidity rather than dryness as\r\nthe prevalent feature of Pleistocene climates. It is obvious, however,\r\nthat after the flood-waters had disappeared from the low-grounds of\r\nthe Continent, sub-aërial action would come into play over the wide\r\nregions covered by the glacial and fluvio-glacial deposits. Thus, in\r\nthe course of time, these deposits would become modified,--just as\r\nsimilar accumulations in these islands have been top-dressed, as it\r\nwere, and to some extent even rearranged. I am strengthened in these\r\nviews by the conclusions arrived at by M. Falsan--the eminent French\r\nglacialist. Covering the plateaux of the Dombes, and widely spread\r\nthroughout the valleys of the Rhone, the Ain, the Isère, etc., in\r\nFrance there is a deposit of löss, he says, which has been derived from\r\nthe washing of the ancient moraines. At the foot of the Alps, where\r\nblack schists are largely developed, the löss is dark grey, but west of\r\nthe secondary chain the same deposit is yellowish, and composed almost\r\nentirely of silicious materials, with only a very little carbonate of\r\nlime. This _limon_ or löss, however, is very generally modified towards\r\nthe top by the chemical action of rain--the yellow löss acquiring a\r\nred colour. Sometimes it is crowded with calcareous concretions, but\r\nat other times it has been deprived of its calcareous element and\r\nconverted into a kind of pulverulent silica or quartz. This, the true\r\nlöss, is distinguished from another _lehm_, which Falsan recognises as\r\nthe product of atmospheric action--formed, in fact, _in situ_, from the\r\ndisintegration and decomposition of the subjacent rocks. Even this lehm\r\nhas been modified by running water--dispersed or accumulated locally,\r\nas the case may be.[AR]\r\n\r\n[AR] Falsan: _La Période glaciaire_, p. 81.\r\n\r\nAll that we know of the löss and its fossils compels us to include\r\nthis accumulation as a product of the Pleistocene period. It is not\r\nof post-glacial age--even much of what one may call the \"remodified\r\nlöss\" being of late Glacial or Pleistocene age. I cannot attempt to\r\ngive here a summary of what has been learned within recent years as\r\nto the fauna of the löss. The researches of Nehring and Liebe have\r\nfamiliarised us with the fact that, at some particular stage in the\r\nPleistocene period, a fauna like that of the alpine steppe-lands\r\nof western Asia was indigenous to middle Europe, and the recent\r\ninvestigations by Woldrich have increased our knowledge of this fauna.\r\nAt what horizon, then, does this steppe-fauna make its appearance?\r\nAt Thiede Dr. Nehring discovered in so-called löss three successive\r\nhorizons, each characterised by a special fauna. The lowest of these\r\nfaunas was decidedly arctic in type; above that came a steppe-fauna,\r\nwhich last was succeeded by a fauna comprising such forms as mammoth,\r\nwoolly rhinoceros, _Bos_, _Cervus_, horse, hyæna, and lion. Now, if\r\nwe compare this last fauna with the forms which have been obtained\r\nfrom true post-glacial deposits--those deposits, namely, which overlie\r\nthe younger boulder-clays and flood-accumulations of the latest\r\nglacial epoch, we find little in common. The lion, the mammoth, and\r\nthe rhinoceros are conspicuous by their absence from the post-glacial\r\nbeds of Europe. In place of them we meet with a more or less arctic\r\nfauna, and a high-alpine and arctic flora, which as we all know\r\neventually gave place to the flora and fauna with which Neolithic man\r\nwas contemporaneous. As this is the case throughout north-western and\r\ncentral Europe, we seem justified in assigning the Thiede beds to the\r\nPleistocene period, and to that interglacial stage which preceded and\r\ngradually merged into the last glacial epoch. That the steppe-fauna\r\nindicates relatively drier conditions of climate than obtained when\r\nperennial snow and ice covered wide areas of the low-ground goes\r\nwithout saying, but I am unable to agree with those who maintain\r\nthat it implies a dry-as-dust climate, like that of some of the\r\nsteppe-regions of our own day. The remarkable commingling of arctic-\r\nand steppe-faunas discovered in the Böhmer-Wald[AS] by Woldrich shows,\r\nI think, that the jerboas, marmots, and hamster-rats were not incapable\r\nof living in the same regions contemporaneously with lemmings,\r\narctic hares, Siberian social voles, etc. But when a cold epoch was\r\npassing away the steppe-forms probably gradually replaced their\r\narctic congeners, as these migrated northwards during the continuous\r\namelioration of the climate.\r\n\r\n[AS] Woldrich: _Sitzungsb. d. kais. Akad. d. W. math. nat. Cl._, 1880,\r\np. 7; 1881, p. 177; 1883, p. 978.\r\n\r\nIf the student of the Pleistocene faunas has certain advantages in the\r\nfact that he has to deal with forms many of which are still living,\r\nhe labours at the same time under disadvantages which are unknown to\r\nhis colleagues who are engaged in the study of the life of far older\r\nperiods. The Pleistocene period was distinguished above all things\r\nby its great oscillations of climate--the successive changes being\r\nrepeated and producing correlative migrations of floras and faunas.\r\nWe know that arctic and temperate faunas and floras flourished during\r\ninterglacial times, and a like succession of life-forms followed the\r\nfinal disappearance of glacial conditions. A study of the organic\r\nremains met with in any particular deposit will not necessarily,\r\ntherefore, enable us to assign these to their proper horizon. The\r\ngeographical position of the deposit, and its relation to Pleistocene\r\naccumulations elsewhere, must clearly be taken into account. Already,\r\nhowever, much has been done in this direction, and it is probable that\r\nere long we shall be able to arrive at a fair knowledge of the various\r\nmodifications which the Pleistocene floras and faunas experienced\r\nduring that protracted period of climatic changes of which I have been\r\nspeaking. We shall even possibly learn how often the arctic, steppe-,\r\nprairie-, and forest-faunas, as they have been defined by Woldrich,\r\nreplaced each other. Even now some approximation to this better\r\nknowledge has been made. Dr. Pohlig,[AT] for example, has compared the\r\nremains of the Pleistocene faunas obtained at many different places\r\nin Europe, and has presented us with a classification which, although\r\nconfessedly incomplete, yet serves to show the direction in which we\r\nmust look for further advances in this department of inquiry.\r\n\r\n[AT] Pohlig: _Sitzungsb. d. niederrheinischen Gesellschaft zu Bonn_,\r\n1884; _Zeitschr. d. deutsch. geolog. Ges._, 1887, p. 798. For a\r\nvery full account of the diluvial European and northern Asiatic\r\nmammalian faunas by Woldrich, see _Mém. de l'Acad. des Sciences de St.\r\nPétersbourg_, vii^e sér., t. xxxv., 1887.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty years the evidence of interglacial conditions\r\nboth in Europe and America has so increased that geologists generally\r\nno longer doubt that the Pleistocene period was characterised by great\r\nchanges of climate. The occurrence at many different localities on the\r\nContinent of beds of lignite and freshwater alluvia, containing remains\r\nof Pleistocene mammalia, intercalated between separate and distinct\r\nboulder-clays has left us no other alternative. The interglacial\r\nbeds of the Alpine Lands of central Europe are paralleled by similar\r\ndeposits in Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, and France. But opinions\r\ndiffer as to the number of glacial and interglacial epochs--many\r\nholding that we have evidence of only two cold stages and one general\r\ninterglacial stage. This, as I have said, is the view entertained\r\nby most geologists who are at work on the glacial accumulations of\r\nScandinavia and north Germany. On the other hand, Dr. Penck and others,\r\nfrom a study of drifts of the German Alpine Lands, believe that they\r\nhave met with evidence of three distinct epochs of glaciation, and two\r\nepochs of interglacial conditions. In France, while some observers\r\nare of opinion that there have been only two epochs of general\r\nglaciation, others, as, for example, M. Tardy, find what they consider\r\nto be evidence of several such epochs. Others again, as M. Falsan,\r\ndo not believe in the existence of any interglacial stages, although\r\nthey readily admit that there were great advances and retreats of\r\nthe ice during the Glacial period. M. Falsan, in short, believes in\r\noscillations, but is of opinion that these were not so extensive as\r\nothers have maintained. It is, therefore, simply a question of degree,\r\nand whether we speak of oscillations or of epochs, we must needs\r\nadmit the fact that throughout all the glaciated tracts of Europe,\r\nfossiliferous deposits occur intercalated among glacial accumulations.\r\nThe successive advance and retreat of the ice, therefore, was not a\r\nlocal phenomenon, but characterised all the glaciated areas. And the\r\nevidence shows that the oscillations referred to were on a gigantic\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThe relation borne to the glacial accumulations by the old river\r\nalluvia which contain relics of palæolithic man early attracted\r\nattention. From the fact that these alluvia in some places overlie\r\nglacial deposits, the general opinion (still held by some) was that\r\npalæolithic man must needs be of post-glacial age. But since we have\r\nlearned that all boulder-clay does not belong to one and the same\r\ngeological horizon--that, in short, there have been at least two,\r\nand probably more, epochs of glaciation--it is obvious that the mere\r\noccurrence of glacial deposits underneath palæolithic gravels does not\r\nprove these latter to be post-glacial. All that we are entitled in such\r\na case to say is simply that the implement-bearing beds are younger\r\nthan the glacial accumulations upon which they rest. Their horizon\r\nmust be determined by first ascertaining the relative position in the\r\nglacial series of the underlying deposits. Now, it is a remarkable\r\nfact that the boulder-clays which underlie such old alluvia belong,\r\nwithout exception, to the earlier stages of the Glacial period. This\r\nhas been proved again and again, not only for this country but for\r\nEurope generally. I am sorry to reflect that some twenty years have now\r\nelapsed since I was led to suspect that the palæolithic deposits were\r\nnot of post-glacial but of glacial and interglacial age. In 1871-72 I\r\npublished a series of papers in the _Geological Magazine_ in which were\r\nset forth the views I had come to form upon this interesting question.\r\nIn these papers it was maintained that the alluvia and cave-deposits\r\ncould not be of post-glacial age, but must be assigned to pre-glacial\r\nand interglacial times, and in chief measure to the latter. Evidence\r\nwas led to show that the latest great development of glacier-ice\r\nin Europe took place after the southern pachyderms and palæolithic\r\nman had vacated England--that during this last stage of the Glacial\r\nperiod man lived contemporaneously with a northern and alpine fauna\r\nin such regions as southern France--and lastly, that palæolithic man\r\nand the southern mammalia never revisited north-western Europe after\r\nextreme glacial conditions had disappeared. These conclusions were\r\narrived at after a somewhat detailed examination of all the evidence\r\nthen available--the remarkable distribution of the palæolithic and\r\nossiferous alluvia having, as I have said, particularly impressed me.\r\nI coloured a map to show at once the areas covered by the glacial and\r\nfluvio-glacial deposits of the last glacial epoch, and the regions in\r\nwhich the implement-bearing and ossiferous alluvia had been met with,\r\nwhen it became apparent that the latter never occurred at the surface\r\nwithin the regions occupied by the former. If ossiferous alluvia did\r\nhere and there appear within the recently glaciated areas it was always\r\neither in caves, or as infra- or interglacial deposits. Since the date\r\nof these researches our knowledge of the geographical distribution of\r\nPleistocene deposits has greatly increased, and implements and other\r\nrelics of palæolithic man have been recorded from many new localities\r\nthroughout Europe. But none of this fresh evidence contradicts the\r\nconclusions I had previously arrived at; on the contrary, it has\r\ngreatly strengthened my general argument.\r\n\r\nProfessor Penck was, I think, the first on the Continent to adopt the\r\nviews referred to. He was among the earliest to recognise the evidence\r\nof interglacial conditions in the drift-covered regions of northern\r\nGermany, and it was the reflections which those remarkable interglacial\r\nbeds were so well calculated to suggest that led him into the same path\r\nas myself. Dr. Penck has published a map[AU] showing the areas covered\r\nby the earlier and later glacial deposits in northern Europe and the\r\nAlpine Lands, and indicating at the same time the various localities\r\nwhere palæolithic finds have occurred, and in not a single case do any\r\nof the latter appear within the areas covered by the accumulations of\r\nthe last glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n[AU] _Archiv für Anthropologie_, Bd. xv. Heft 3, 1884.\r\n\r\nA glance at the papers which have been published in Germany within\r\nthe last few years will show how greatly students of the Pleistocene\r\nossiferous beds have been influenced by what is now known of\r\nthe interglacial deposits and their organic remains. Professors\r\nRothpletz[AV] and Andreæ,[AW] Dr. Pohlig[AX] and others, do not\r\nnow hesitate to correlate with those beds the old ossiferous and\r\nimplement-bearing alluvia which lie altogether outside of glaciated\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n[AV] Rothpletz: _Denkschrift d. schweizer. Ges. für d. gesammt. Nat._,\r\nBd. xxviii. 1881.\r\n\r\n[AW] Andreæ: _Abhandl. z. geolog. Specialkarte v. Elsass-Lothringen_,\r\nBd. iv. Heft 2, 1884.\r\n\r\n[AX] Pohlig: _op. cit._\r\n\r\nThe relation of the Pleistocene alluvia of France to the glacial\r\ndeposits of that and other countries has been especially canvassed.\r\nRothpletz, in the paper I have cited, includes these alluvia amongst\r\nthe interglacial deposits, and in the present year (1889) we have an\r\ninteresting essay on the same subject by the accomplished secretary of\r\nthe Anthropological and Archæological Congress which met recently in\r\nParis. M. Boule[AY] correlates the palæolithic cave- and river-deposits\r\nof France with those of other countries, and shows that they must be\r\nof interglacial age. His classification, I am gratified to find, does\r\nnot materially differ from that given by myself a number of years ago.\r\nHe is satisfied that in France there is evidence of three glacial\r\nepochs and two well-marked interglacial horizons. The oldest of the\r\npalæolithic stages of Mortillet (Chelléenne) culminated according\r\nto Boule during the last interglacial epoch, while the more recent\r\npalæolithic stages (Moustérienne, Solutréenne, and Magdalénienne)\r\ncoincided with the last great development of glacier-ice. The\r\nPalæolithic age, so far as Europe is concerned, came to a close during\r\nthis last cold phase of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\n[AY] Boule: _Revue d'Anthropologie_, 1889, t. 1.\r\n\r\nThere are many other points relating to glacial geology which have\r\nof late years been canvassed by Continental workers, but these I\r\ncannot discuss here. I have purposely indeed restricted my remarks\r\nto such parts of a wide subject as I thought might have interest for\r\nglacialists in this country, some of whom may not have had their\r\nattention directed to the results which have recently been attained\r\nby their fellow-labourers in other lands. Had time permitted I should\r\ngladly have dwelt upon the noteworthy advances made by our American\r\nbrethren in the same department of inquiry. Especially should I have\r\nwished to direct attention to the remarkable evidence adduced in\r\nfavour of the periodicity of glacial action. Thus Messrs. Chamberlin\r\nand Salisbury, after a general review of that evidence, maintain\r\nthat the Ice Age was interrupted by one chief interglacial epoch and\r\nalso by three interglacial sub-epochs or episodes of deglaciation.\r\nThese authors discuss at some length the origin of the löss, and come\r\nto the general conclusion that while deposits of this character may\r\nhave been formed at different stages of the Glacial period, and under\r\ndifferent conditions, yet upon the whole they are best explained by\r\naqueous action. Indeed a perusal of the recent geological literature of\r\nAmerica shows a close accord between the theoretical opinions of many\r\nTransatlantic and European geologists.\r\n\r\nThus as years advance the picture of Pleistocene times becomes more and\r\nmore clearly developed. The conditions under which our old palæolithic\r\npredecessors lived--the climatic and geographical changes of which they\r\nwere the witnesses--are gradually being revealed with a precision that\r\nonly a few years ago might well have seemed impossible. This of itself\r\nis extremely interesting, but I feel sure that I speak the conviction\r\nof many workers in this field of labour when I say that the clearing\r\nup of the history of Pleistocene times is not the only end which they\r\nhave in view. One can hardly doubt that when the conditions of that\r\nperiod and the causes which gave rise to these have been more fully\r\nand definitely ascertained we shall have advanced some way towards\r\nthe better understanding of the climatic conditions of still earlier\r\nperiods. For it cannot be denied that our knowledge of Palæozoic,\r\nMesozoic, and even early Cainozoic climates is unsatisfactory. But\r\nwe may look forward to the time when much of this uncertainty will\r\ndisappear. Meteorologists are every day acquiring a clearer conception\r\nof the distribution of atmospheric pressure and temperature and the\r\ncauses by which that distribution is determined, and the day is\r\napproaching when we shall be better able than we are now to apply this\r\nextended meteorological knowledge to the explanation of the climates\r\nof former periods in the world's history. One of the chief factors in\r\nthe present distribution of atmospheric temperature and pressure is\r\ndoubtless the relative position of the great land- and water-areas;\r\nand if this be true of the present, it must be true also of the past.\r\nIt would almost seem, then, as if all one had to do to ascertain the\r\nclimatic conditions of any particular period, was to prepare a map\r\ndepicting with some approach to accuracy the former relative position\r\nof land and sea. With such a map could our meteorologists infer what\r\nthe climatic conditions must have been? Yes, provided we could assure\r\nthem that in other respects the physical conditions did not differ\r\nfrom the present. Now there is no period in the past history of our\r\nglobe the geographical conditions of which are better known than the\r\nPleistocene. And yet, when we have indicated these upon a map, we find\r\nthat they do not give the results which we might have expected. The\r\nclimatic conditions which they seem to imply are not such as we know\r\ndid actually obtain. It is obvious, therefore, that some additional\r\nand perhaps exceptional factor was at work to produce the recognised\r\nresults. What was this disturbing element, and have we any evidence of\r\nits interference with the operation of the normal agents of climatic\r\nchange in earlier periods of the world's history? We all know that\r\nvarious answers have been given to such questions. Whether amongst\r\nthese the correct solution of the enigma is to be found, time will\r\nshow. Meanwhile, as all hypothesis and theory must starve without facts\r\nto feed on, it behoves us as working geologists to do our best to add\r\nto the supply. The success with which other problems have been attacked\r\nby geologists forbids us to doubt that ere long we shall have done much\r\nto dispel some of the mystery which still envelopes the question of\r\ngeological climates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial Period and the Earth-Movement Hypothesis.[AZ]\r\n\r\n[AZ] This article contains the substance of two papers, one read before\r\nthe Victoria Institute, in 1892; the other an address delivered to the\r\nGeological Society of Edinburgh, in 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no portion of the geological record has been more assiduously\r\nstudied during the last quarter of a century than its closing chapters.\r\nWe are now in possession of manifold data concerning the interpretation\r\nof which there seems to be general agreement. But while that is the\r\ncase, there remain, nevertheless, certain facts or groups of facts\r\nwhich are variously accounted for. Nor have all the phenomena of\r\nthe Pleistocene period received equal attention from those who have\r\nrecently speculated and generalised on the subject of Pleistocene\r\nclimate and geography. Yet, we may be sure, geologists are not likely\r\nto arrive at any safe conclusions as to the conditions that obtained\r\nin Pleistocene times, unless the evidence be candidly considered\r\nin all its bearings. No interpretation of that evidence which does\r\nnot recognise every outstanding group of facts can be expected to\r\nendure. It may be possible to frame a plausible theory to account for\r\nsome particular conspicuous phenomena, but should that theory leave\r\nunexplained a residuum of less conspicuous but nevertheless well-proved\r\nfacts, then, however strongly it may be fortified, it must assuredly\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, there are many phenomena in the interpretation of\r\nwhich geologists are generally agreed. It is, for example, no longer\r\ndisputed that in Pleistocene times vast sheets of ice--continental\r\n_mers de glace_--covered broad areas in Europe and North America, and\r\nthat extensive snow-fields and large local glaciers existed in many\r\nmountain-regions where snow-fields and glaciers are now unknown, or\r\nonly meagrely developed. It is quite unnecessary, however, that I\r\nshould give even the slightest sketch of the aspect presented by the\r\nglaciated tracts of our hemisphere at the climax of the Ice Age. The\r\ngeographical distribution and extent of the old snow-fields, glaciers,\r\nand ice-sheets is matter now of common knowledge. It will be well,\r\nhowever, to understand clearly the nature of the conditions which\r\nobtained at the climax of glacial cold--at that stage, namely, when the\r\nAlpine glaciers reached their greatest development, and when so much of\r\nEurope was cased in snow and ice. This we shall best do by comparing\r\nthe present with the past. Now in our day the limits of perennial snow\r\nare attained at heights that necessarily vary with the latitude. This\r\nis shown as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Region._     _N. Lat._    _Height of Snow-Line._\r\n\r\n  Iceland,         65°               3,070 feet.\r\n  Norway,          61°         5,180-5,570  \"\r\n  N. Urals,        59° 30'           4,790  \"\r\n  Alps,            46°      8,884 or 9,000  \"\r\n  Caucasus,        43°       10,600-11,000  \"\r\n  Apennines,       42° 30'           9,520  \"\r\n  Etna,            37° 30'           9,530  \"\r\n  Sierra Nevada,   37°              11,187  \"\r\n\r\nThus in traversing Europe from north to south the snow-line may be\r\nsaid to rise from 3000 feet to 11,000 feet in round numbers. It is\r\npossible from such data to draw across the map a series of isochional\r\nlines, or lines of equal perennial snow, and this has been done by my\r\nfriend, Professor Penck of Vienna.[BA] It will be understood that each\r\nisochional line traverses those regions above which the line of névé\r\nis estimated to occur at the same height. Thus the isochional line of\r\n1000 metres (3280 feet) runs from the north of Norway down to lat. 64°\r\non the west coast, whence it must pass west to the south of Iceland.\r\nThe line of 1500 metres (4920 ft.) is traced from the north end of the\r\nUrals in a westerly direction. It then follows the back-bone of the\r\nScandinavian peninsula, passes over to Scotland, and thence strikes\r\nwest along lat. 55°. For each of these lines good data are obtainable.\r\nThe line of 2000 metres (6560 ft.) is, however, hypothetical. It is\r\nestimated to extend from the Ural Mountains, about the lat. of 57°,\r\nover the mountains of middle Germany and above the north of France. The\r\nline of 2500 metres (8200 ft.) passes from the southern termination of\r\nthe Urals, in lat. 51°, to the east Carpathians, thence along the north\r\nface of the Alps, thereafter south-west across the Cevennes to the\r\nnorth-west end of the Pyrenees; and thence above the Cantabrian and the\r\nPortuguese Highlands to the coast in lat. 39°. The line of 3000 metres\r\n(9840 ft.) is estimated to occur above the Caspian Sea, near lat. 44°,\r\nand extends west through the north end of the Caucasus to the Balkans.\r\nThence it is traced north-west to the Alps, south-west to the Pyrenees,\r\nwhich range it follows to the west, and thereafter sweeps south above\r\nthe coast at Cadiz. The line of 3500 metres (11,480 ft.) runs from\r\nthe Caucasus south-west across Asia Minor to the Lebanon Mountains;\r\nthence it follows the direction of the Mediterranean, and traverses\r\nMorocco above the north face of the Atlas range. Finally the line of\r\n4000 metres (13,120 feet) is estimated to trend in the same general\r\ndirection as the last-mentioned line, but, of course, further to the\r\nsouth. Although these isochional lines are to some extent conjectural,\r\nyet the data upon which they are based are sufficiently numerous and\r\nwell-known to prevent any great error, and we may admit that the lines\r\nrepresent with tolerable accuracy the general position of the snow-line\r\nover our Continent. So greatly has our knowledge of the glaciation of\r\nEurope increased during recent years, that the height of the snow-line\r\nof the Glacial period has been determined by MM. Simony, Partsch,\r\nPenck, and Höfer. Their method is simple enough. They first ascertain\r\nthe lowest parts of a glaciated region from which independent glaciers\r\nhave flowed. This gives the maximum height of the old snow-line. Next\r\nthey determine the lowest point reached by such glaciers. It is obvious\r\nthat the snow-line would occur higher up than that, but at a lower\r\nlevel than the actual source of the glaciers; and thus the minimum\r\nheight of the former snow-line is approximately ascertained. The\r\nlowest level from which independent glaciers formerly flowed, and the\r\nterminal point reached by the highest-lying glaciers having been duly\r\nascertained, it is possible to determine with sufficient accuracy the\r\nmean height of the old snow-line. The required data are best obtained,\r\nas one might have expected, in the Pyrenees and amongst the mountains\r\nof middle and southern Europe. In those regions the snow-line would\r\nseem to have been some 3000 feet or so lower than now. From such\r\ndata Professor Penck has constructed a map showing the isochional\r\nlines of the Glacial period. These lines are, I need hardly say, only\r\napproximations, but they are sufficiently near the truth to bring out\r\nthe contrast between the Ice Age and the present. Thus the isochional\r\nof 1000 metres, which at present lies above northern Scandinavia,\r\nwas pushed south to the latitude of southern France and north Italy;\r\nwhile the isochional of 2000 metres (now overlying the extreme north\r\nof France and north Germany) passed in glacial times over the northern\r\npart of the Mediterranean.[BB]\r\n\r\n[BA] \"Geographische Wirkungen der Eiszeit,\" _Verhandl. d. vierten\r\ndeutschen Geographentages zu München_, 1884.\r\n\r\n[BB] It is interesting to note that while in the Tatra (north\r\nCarpathians) the snow-line was depressed in glacial times to the extent\r\nof 2700 feet only, in the Alps it descended some 4000 feet or more\r\nbelow its present level. With the snow-line of that great chain at such\r\nan elevation it is obvious that only a few of the higher points of the\r\nApennines could rise into the region of _névé_. This is the reason why\r\nmoraines are met with in only the higher valleys of that range.\r\n\r\nIsochional lines are not isotherms. Their height and direction are\r\ndetermined not only by temperature, but by the amount and distribution\r\nof the snow-fall. Nevertheless, the position of the snow-line in\r\nEurope during the Ice Age enables us to form a rough estimate of the\r\ntemperature. At present in middle Europe the temperature falls 1° F.\r\nfor every 300 feet of ascent. Hence if we take the average depression\r\nof the snow-line in glacial times at 3000 feet, that would correspond\r\napproximately to a lowering of the temperature by 10°.[BC] This may\r\nnot appear to be much, but, as Penck points out, were the mean annual\r\ntemperature to be lowered to that extent it would bring the climate of\r\nnorthern Norway down to southern Germany, and the climate of Sweden to\r\nAustria and Moravia, while that of the Alps would be met with over the\r\nbasin of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[BC] Professor Brückner thinks the general lowering of temperature\r\nmay not have exceeded 5-1/2° to 7° F. _Verhandlungen der 73\r\nJahresversammlung der schweizerischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in\r\nDavos_, 1890.\r\n\r\nLet it be noted further that this lowering of the temperature--this\r\ndisplacement of climatic zones, was experienced over the whole\r\ncontinent--extending on the one hand south into Africa, and on the\r\nother east into Asia. But while the conditions in northern and central\r\nEurope were markedly glacial, further south only more or less isolated\r\nsnow-capped mountains and local glaciers appeared--such, for example,\r\nas those of the Sierra Nevada, the Apennines, Corsica, the Atlas, the\r\nLebanon, etc. In connection with these facts we may note also that\r\nthe Azores were reached by floating ice; and I need only refer in a\r\nword to the evidence of cold wet conditions as furnished by the plant\r\nand animal remains of the Pleistocene tufas, alluvia, and peat of\r\nsouthern Europe. Again in north Africa and Syria we find, in desiccated\r\nregions, widespread fluviatile accumulations, which, in the opinion of\r\na number of competent observers, are indicative of rainy conditions\r\ncontemporaneous with the Glacial period of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the conditions of the Ice Age with those of the present\r\nwe are struck with the fact that the former were only an exaggeration\r\nof the latter. The development of glaciation was in strict accordance\r\nwith existing conditions. Thus in Pleistocene times North America\r\nwas more extensively glaciated than northern Europe, just as to-day\r\nGreenland shows more snow and ice than Scandinavia. No traces of\r\nglaciation have been observed as yet in northern Asia or in northern\r\nAlaska, and to-day the only glaciers and ice-sheets that exist in\r\nnorthern regions are confined to the formerly glaciated areas. Again,\r\nin Pleistocene Europe glacial phenomena were more strongly developed\r\nin the west than in the east. Large glaciers, for example, existed in\r\ncentral France, and a considerable ice-flow poured into the basin of\r\nthe Douro. But in the same latitudes of eastern Europe we meet with\r\nfew or no traces of ice-action. Again, the Vosges appear to have been\r\nmore severely glaciated than the mountains of middle Germany; and so\r\nlikewise the old glaciers of the western Alps were on a much more\r\nextensive scale than those towards the east end of the chain. Similar\r\ncontrasts may be noted at the present day. Thus we find glaciers in\r\nNorway under lat. 60°, while in the Ural Mountains in the same latitude\r\nthere is none. The glaciers of the western Alps, again, are larger than\r\nthose in the eastern part of the chain. The Caucasus region, it is\r\ntrue, has considerable glaciers, but then the mountains are higher.\r\n\r\nNow turn for a moment to North America. The eastern area was covered\r\nby one immense ice-sheet, while in the mountainous region of the west\r\ngigantic glaciers existed. In our own day we see a similar contrast.\r\nIn the north-east lies Greenland well-nigh drowned in ice, while the\r\nnorth-west region on the other hand, although considerably higher and\r\noccurring in the same latitude, holds only local glaciers. We may\r\nfurther note that at the present day very dry regions, even when these\r\nare relatively lofty and in high latitudes, such as the uplands of\r\nSiberia, contain no glaciers. And the same was the case in the Glacial\r\nperiod. These facts are sufficient to show that the conditions of\r\nglacial times bore an intimate relation to those that now obtain. Could\r\nthe requisite increase of precipitation and lowering of temperature\r\ntake place, we cannot doubt that ice-sheets and glaciers would reappear\r\nin precisely the same regions where they were formerly so extensively\r\ndeveloped. No change in the relative elevation of the land would be\r\nrequired--increased precipitation accompanied by a general lowering of\r\nthe snow-line for 3000 or 3500 feet would suffice to reintroduce the\r\nIce Age.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing considerations we may conclude:--(1) That the\r\ncold of the Glacial period was a general phenomenon, due to some\r\nwidely-acting cause--a cause sufficient to influence contemporaneously\r\nthe climate of Europe and North America; (2) that glaciation in our\r\ncontinent increased in intensity from east to west, and from south to\r\nnorth; (3) that where now we have the greatest rainfall, in glacial\r\ntimes the greatest snow-fall took place, and the snow tended most to\r\naccumulate; (4) that in the extreme south of Europe, and in north\r\nAfrica and west Asia, increased rain precipitation accompanied lowering\r\nof temperature, from which it may be inferred that precipitation in\r\nglacial times was greater generally than it is now.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the climatic conditions that obtained at the climax\r\nof the Glacial period, I have next to recapitulate what is known\r\nas to the climatic changes of Pleistocene times. It is generally\r\nadmitted that the glacial conditions of which I have been speaking\r\nwere repeated twice, some say three times, during the Pleistocene\r\nperiod; while others maintain that even a larger number of glacial\r\nepisodes may have occurred. Two glacial epochs, at all events, have\r\nbeen recognised generally both in Europe and North America. These were\r\nseparated by an interglacial stage of more genial conditions, the\r\nevidence for which is steadily increasing. No one now calls in question\r\nthe existence of interglacial deposits, but, as their occurrence is\r\nrather a stumbling-block in the way of certain recently resuscitated\r\nhypotheses, some attempt has been made to minimise their importance--to\r\nexplain them away, in fact. It has been suggested, for example--(and\r\nthe suggestion is by no means new)--that the deposits in question\r\nonly show that there were local oscillations during the advance and\r\nretreat of the old ice-sheets and glaciers. This, however, is not the\r\nview of those who have observed and described interglacial beds--who\r\nknow the nature of the organic remains which they have yielded, and\r\nthe conditions under which the beds must have been accumulated. I need\r\nnot refer to the interglacial deposits of our own country further\r\nthan to remark that they certainly cannot be explained away in that\r\nsummary fashion. The peat and freshwater beds that lie between the\r\nlower and upper tills in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, for example,\r\nare of themselves sufficient to prove a marked and decided change of\r\nclimate. No mere temporary retreat and re-advance of the ice-sheet\r\nwill account for their occurrence. The lower till is unquestionably\r\nthe bottom-moraine of an ice-sheet which, in that region, flowed\r\ntowards the east. When the geographical position of the deposits in\r\nquestion is considered it becomes clear that an easterly flow of ice\r\nin Mid-Lothian proves beyond gainsaying that during the accumulation\r\nof the lower till all Scotland was drowned in ice. But when water once\r\nmore flowed over the land-surface--when a temperate flora, composed\r\nof hazels and other plants, again appeared, it is obvious that the\r\nice-sheet had already vanished from central Scotland. This is not the\r\ncase of a mere temporary recession of the ice-front. It is impossible\r\nto believe that a temperate or even cold-temperate flora could have\r\nflourished in central Scotland at a period when thick glacier-ice\r\nmantled any portion of our Lowlands. Again, in the upper till we read\r\nthe evidence of a recurrence of extreme glacial conditions--when\r\ncentral Scotland was once more overwhelmed by confluent ice-streams\r\ncoming from the Highlands and the southern Uplands. Similar evidence\r\nof recurrent glacial conditions, I need hardly remind you, has been\r\ndetected in other parts of the country. We are justified, then, in\r\nmaintaining that our interglacial beds point to distinct oscillations\r\nof climate--oscillations which imply a long lapse of time. Continental\r\nobservers are equally convinced that the interglacial epoch, of which\r\nso many interesting relics have been preserved over a wide region, was\r\nmarked at its climax by a temperate climate and endured for a long\r\nperiod. The interglacial beds of northern and central Europe form\r\neverywhere marked horizons in the glacial series.\r\n\r\nGeologists sometimes forget that in every region where glacial\r\naccumulations are well developed, good observers had recognised an\r\nupper and lower series of \"drift-deposits\" long before the idea of two\r\nseparate glacial epochs had presented itself. Thus, in north Germany,\r\nso clearly is the Upper differentiated from the Lower Diluvium that\r\nthe two series had been noted and mapped as separate accumulations\r\nfor years before geologists had formulated the theory of successive\r\nice-epochs.[BD] The division of the German Diluvium into an upper\r\nand a lower series is as firmly established as any other well-marked\r\ndivision in historical geology. The stratigraphical evidence has been\r\nmuch strengthened, however, by the discovery between upper and lower\r\nboulder-clays of true interglacial beds, containing lignite, peat,\r\ndiatomaceous earth, and marine, brackish, and freshwater molluscs,\r\nfish, etc., and now and again bones of Pleistocene mammals.[BE]\r\nA similar strongly-marked division characterises the glacial\r\naccumulations of Sweden, as has been clearly shown by De Geer,[BF] who\r\nthinks that the older and younger epochs of glaciation were separated\r\nby a protracted period of interglacial conditions. In short, evidence\r\nof a break in the glacial succession has been traced at intervals\r\nacross the whole width of the Continent, from the borders of the North\r\nSea to central Russia. M. Krischtafowitsch has recently detected in the\r\nneighbourhood of Moscow[BG] certain fossiliferous interglacial beds,\r\nthe flora and fauna of which indicate a warmer and moister climate than\r\nthe present. The interglacial stage, he says, must have been of long\r\nduration, and separated in Russia as in western Europe two distinct\r\nepochs of glaciation.\r\n\r\n[BD] Wahnschaffe: _Forschungen zur deutschen Landes- und Volkskunde von\r\nDr. A.

For further references see Wahnschaffe,\r\n_op. cit._ I have not thought it worth while in this paper to refer\r\nto the interglacial deposits of our own islands. A general account of\r\nthem will be found in my _Great Ice Age_, and _Prehistoric Europe_. The\r\ninterglacial phenomena of the Continent seem to be less known here than\r\nthey ought to be.\r\n\r\n[BF] _Zeitschrift d. deutsch. geolog. Gesellschaft_, Bd. xxxvii, p. 197.\r\n\r\n[BG] _Anzeichen einer interglaziären Epoche in Central-Russland_,\r\nMoskau, 1891.\r\n\r\nNo mere temporary retreat and re-advance of the ice-front can account\r\nfor these phenomena. The occurrence of remains of the great pachyderms\r\nat Rixdorf, near Berlin, and the character of the flora met with in\r\nthe interglacial beds of north Germany and Russia are incompatible\r\nwith glacial conditions in the low-grounds of northern Europe. The\r\ninterglacial beds, described by Dr. C. Weber[BH] as occurring near\r\nGrünenthal, in Holstein, are among the more recent discoveries of\r\nthis kind. These deposits rest upon boulder-clay, and are overlaid by\r\nanother sheet of the same character, and belong, according to Weber,\r\nto \"that great interglacial period which preceded the last ice-sheet\r\nof northern Europe.\" The section shows 8 feet of peat resting on\r\nfreshwater clay, 2 feet thick, which is underlaid by some 10 feet of\r\n\"coral sand,\" with bryozoa. The flora and fauna have a distinctly\r\ntemperate facies. It is no wonder, then, that Continental geologists\r\nare generally inclined to admit that north Germany and the contiguous\r\ncountries have been invaded at least twice by the ice-sheets of two\r\nseparate and distinct glacial epochs. This is not all, however. While\r\nevery observer acknowledges that the Diluvium is properly divided\r\ninto an upper and a lower series, there are some geologists who have\r\ndescribed the occurrence of three, and even more boulder-clays--the\r\none clearly differentiated from the other, and traceable over wide\r\nareas. Is each of these to be considered the product of an independent\r\nice-sheet, or do they only indicate more or less extensive oscillations\r\nof the ice-front? The boulder-clays are parted from each other by thick\r\nbeds of sand and clay, in some of which fossils have occasionally\r\nbeen detected. It is quite possible that such stratified beds were\r\ndeposited during a temporary retreat of the ice-front, which when it\r\nre-advanced covered them up with its bottom-moraine. On the other\r\nhand, the phenomena are equally explicable on the assumption that\r\neach boulder-clay represents a separate epoch of glaciation. Until\r\nthe stratified beds have yielded more abundant traces of the life of\r\nthe period, our judgment as to the conditions implied by them must be\r\nsuspended. It is worthy of note in this connection, however, that in\r\nNorth America the existence of one prolonged interglacial epoch has\r\nbeen well established, while distinct evidence is forthcoming of what\r\nChamberlin discriminates as \"stages of deglaciation and re-advancing\r\nice.\"[BI]\r\n\r\n[BH] _Neues Jahrbuch f. Mineralogie, Geologie, u. Palæontologie_, 1891,\r\nBd. ii., pp. 62, 228; 1892, Bd. i., p. 114.\r\n\r\n[BI] _Sixth Annual Report, U. S. Geol. Survey_, 1884-5, P. 315.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the Alpine Lands, we find that there also the\r\noccurrence of former interglacial conditions has been recognised.\r\nThe interglacial deposits, as described by Heer and others, are well\r\nknown. These form as definite a geological horizon as the similar\r\nfossiliferous zone in the Diluvium of northern Germany. The lignites,\r\nas Heer pointed out, represent a long period of time, and this is still\r\nfurther illustrated by the fact that considerable fluviatile erosion\r\nsupervened between the close of the first and the advent of the later\r\nglacial epoch. No mere temporary retreat and re-advance of the ice will\r\naccount for the phenomena. Let us for a moment consider the conditions\r\nunder which the accumulations in question were laid down. The glacial\r\ndeposits underlying the lignite beds contain, amongst other erratics,\r\nboulders which have come from the upper valley of the Rhine. This\r\nmeans, of course, that the ancient glacier of the Rhine succeeded in\r\nreaching the Lake of Zurich; and it is well known that it extended at\r\nthe same time to Lake Constance. That glacier, therefore exceeded sixty\r\nmiles in length. One cannot doubt that the climatic conditions implied\r\nby this great extension were excessive, and quite incompatible with\r\nthe appearance in the low-grounds of Switzerland of such a flora as\r\nthat of the lignites. The organic remains of the lignite beds indicate\r\na climate certainly not less temperate than that which at present\r\ncharacterises the district round the Lake of Zurich. We may safely\r\ninfer, therefore, that during interglacial times the glaciers of the\r\nAlps were not more extensively developed than at present. Again, as\r\nthe lignites are overlaid by glacial deposits, it is obvious that the\r\nRhine glacier once more reached Lake Zurich--in other words, there was\r\na return of the excessive climate that induced the first great advance\r\nof that and other Swiss glaciers. That these advances were really due\r\nto extreme climatic conditions is shown by the fact that it was only\r\nunder such conditions that the Scandinavian flora could have invaded\r\nthe low-grounds of Europe, and entered Switzerland. It is impossible,\r\ntherefore, that the interglacial flora could have flourished in\r\nSwitzerland while the immigration of these northern plants was taking\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nLignites of the same age as those of Dürnten and Utznach occur\r\nin many places both on the north and south sides of the Alpine\r\nchain. At Imberg, near Sonthofen, in Bavaria, for example, they are\r\ndescribed by Penck[BJ] as being underlaid and overlaid by thick\r\nglacial accumulations. The deposits in question form a terrace along\r\nthe flanks of the hills, at a height of 700 feet above the Iller.\r\nThe flora of the lignite has not yet been fully studied, but it is\r\ncomposed chiefly of conifers, which must have grown near where their\r\nremains now occur--that is at 3000 feet, or thereabout, above the sea.\r\nIt is incredible that coniferous forests could have flourished at\r\nthat elevation during a glacial epoch. A lowering of the mean annual\r\ntemperature by 3° C. only would render the growth of trees at that\r\nheight almost impossible, and certainly would be insufficient to cause\r\nthe glaciers of Algau to descend to the foot of the mountains, as we\r\nknow they did--a distance of at least twenty-four miles. The Imberg\r\nlignites, therefore, are evidence of a climate not less temperate than\r\nthe present. More than this, there is clear proof that the interglacial\r\nstage was long continued, for during that epoch the Iller had time to\r\neffect very considerable erosion. The succession of changes shown by\r\nthe sections near Sonthofen are as follows.\r\n\r\n1. The Iller Valley is filled with glacier-ice which flows out upon the\r\nlow-grounds at the base of the Alps.\r\n\r\n2. The glacier retreats, and great sheets of shingle and gravel are\r\nspread over the valley.\r\n\r\n3. Coniferous forests now grow over the surface of the gravels; and as\r\nthe lignite formed of their remains attains a thickness of ten feet in\r\nall, it obviously points to the lapse of some considerable time.\r\n\r\n4. Eventually the forests decay, and their débris is buried under new\r\naccumulations of shingle and gravel.\r\n\r\n5. The Iller cuts its way down through all the deposits to depths of\r\n680 to 720 feet.\r\n\r\n6. A glacier again descends and fills the valley, but does not flow so\r\nfar as that of the earlier glacial stage.\r\n\r\n[BJ] _Die Vergletscherung der deutschen Alpen_, 1882, p. 256.\r\n\r\nIn this section, as in those at Dürnten and Utznach, we have\r\nconclusive evidence of two glacial epochs, sharply marked off the one\r\nfrom the other. Nor does that evidence stand alone, for at various\r\npoints between Lake Geneva and the lower valley of the Inn similar\r\ninterglacial deposits occur. Sometimes these appear at the foot of\r\nthe mountains, as at Mörschweil on Lake Constance; sometimes just\r\nwithin the mountain area, as at Imberg; sometimes far in the heart\r\nof the Alpine Lands, as at Innsbruck. Professor Penck has further\r\nshown, and his observations have been confirmed by Brückner, Blaas,\r\nand Böhm, that massive sheets of fluviatile gravel are frequently\r\nmet with throughout the valleys of the Alps, occupying interglacial\r\npositions. These gravels are exactly comparable to the interglacial\r\ngravels of the Sonthofen sections. And it has been demonstrated that\r\nthey occur on two horizons, separated the one from the other by\r\ncharacteristic ground-moraine, or boulder-clay. The lower gravels\r\nrest on ground-moraine, and the upper gravels are overlaid by sheets\r\nof the same kind of glacial detritus. In short, three separate and\r\ndistinct ground-moraines are recognised. The gravels, one cannot doubt,\r\nare simply the torrential and fluviatile deposits laid down before\r\nadvancing and retreating glaciers; and it is especially to be noted\r\nthat each sheet of gravel, after its accumulation, was much denuded\r\nand cut through by river-action. In a word, as Penck and others have\r\nshown, the valleys of Upper Bavaria have been occupied by glaciers at\r\nthree successive epochs--each separated from the other by a period\r\nduring which much river-gravel was deposited and great erosion of the\r\nvalley-bottoms was effected.\r\n\r\nOn the Italian side of the Alps, similar evidence of climatic changes\r\nis forthcoming. The lignites and lacustrine strata of Val Gandino,\r\nand of Val Borlezza, as I have elsewhere shown,[BK] are clearly of\r\ninterglacial age. From these deposits many organic remains have been\r\nobtained--amongst the animals being _Rhinoceros hemitoechus_ and _R.\r\nleptorhinus_. According to Sordelli, the plants indicate a climate\r\nas genial as that of the plains of Lombardy and Venetia, and warmer\r\ntherefore than that of the upland valleys in which the interglacial\r\nbeds occur. Professor Penck informs me that some time ago he detected\r\nevidence in the district of Lake Garda of three successive glacial\r\nepochs--the evidence being of the same character as that recognised in\r\nthe valleys of the Bavarian Alps.\r\n\r\n[BK] _Prehistoric Europe_, p. 303.\r\n\r\nIn the glaciated districts of France similar phenomena are met with.\r\nThus in Cantal, according to M. Rames,[BL] the glacial deposits belong\r\nto two separate epochs. The older morainic accumulations are scattered\r\nover the surface of the plateau of Archæan schistose rocks, and extend\r\nup the slopes of the great volcanic cone of that region to heights\r\nof 2300 to 3300 feet. One of the features of these accumulations\r\nare the innumerable gigantic erratics, known to the country folk as\r\n_cimetière des enragés_. Sheets of fluvio-glacial gravel are also\r\nassociated with the moraines, and it is worthy of note that both have\r\nthe aspect of considerable age--they have evidently been subjected to\r\nmuch denudation. In the valleys of the same region occurs a younger\r\nseries of glacial deposits, consisting of conspicuous lateral and\r\nterminal moraines, which, unlike the older accumulations, have a very\r\nfresh and well-preserved appearance. With them, as with the older\r\nmoraines, fluvio-glacial gravels are associated. M. Rames shows that\r\nthe interval that supervened between the formation of the two series of\r\nglacial deposits must have been prolonged, for the valleys during that\r\ninterval were in some places eroded to a depth of 900 feet. Not only\r\nwas the volcanic _massif_ deeply incised, but even the old plateau of\r\ncrystalline rocks on which the volcanic cone reposes suffered extensive\r\ndenudation in interglacial times. M. Rames further recognises that the\r\nsecond glacial epoch was marked by two advances of the valley-glaciers,\r\nseparated by a marked episode of fusion, the evidence for which is\r\nconspicuous in the valley of the Cère.\r\n\r\n[BL] _Bull. Soc. Géol. de France_, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe glacial and interglacial phenomena of Auvergne are quite analogous\r\nto those of Cantal. Dr. Julien has described the morainic accumulations\r\nof a large glacier that flowed from Mont Dore. After that glacier had\r\nretreated a prolonged period of erosion followed, when the morainic\r\ndeposits were deeply trenched, and the underlying rocks cut into.\r\nIn the valleys and hollows thus excavated freshwater beds occur,\r\ncontaining the relics of an abundant flora, together with the remains\r\nof elephant (_E. meridionalis_), rhinoceros (_R. leptorhinus_),\r\nhippopotamus, horse, cave-bear, hyæna, etc.--a fauna comparable to\r\nthat of the Italian interglacial deposits. After the deposition of the\r\nfreshwater beds, glaciers again descended the Auvergne valleys and\r\ncovered the beds in question with their moraines.[BM]\r\n\r\n[BM] _Des Phénomènes glaciaires dans le Plateau central de France, etc._\r\n\r\nAccording to the researches of Martins, Collomb, Garrigou,\r\nPiette, and Penck, there is clear evidence in the Pyrenees of two\r\nperiods of glaciation, separated by an interval of much erosion\r\nand valley-excavation. Penck, indeed, has shown that the valleys\r\nof the Pyrenees have been occupied at three successive epochs by\r\nglaciers--each epoch being represented by its series of moraines and by\r\nterraces of fluvio-glacial detritus, which occur at successively lower\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\nI have referred in some detail to these discoveries of interglacial\r\nphenomena because they so strongly corroborate the conclusions\r\narrived at a number of years ago by glacialists in our own country.\r\nMany additional examples might be cited from other parts of Europe,\r\nbut those already given may serve to show that at least one epoch of\r\ninterglacial conditions supervened during the Pleistocene period.\r\nBefore leaving this part of my subject, however, I may point out the\r\nsignificant circumstance that long before much was known of glaciation,\r\nand certainly before the periodicity of ice-epochs had been recognised,\r\nCollomb had detected in the Vosges conspicuous evidence of two\r\nsuccessive glaciations.[BN]\r\n\r\n[BN] _Preuves de l'existence d'anciens glaciers dans les vallées des\r\nVosges_, 1847, p. 141.\r\n\r\nHaving shown that alike in the regions formerly occupied by the great\r\nnorthern ice-sheet, and in the Alpine Lands of central and southern\r\nEurope, alternations of cold and genial conditions characterised the\r\nso-called Glacial period, we may now glance at the evidence supplied\r\nby those Pleistocene deposits that lie outside of the glaciated\r\nareas. Of these we have a typical example in the river-accumulations\r\nof the Rhine Valley between Bâle and Bingen. Here and there these\r\ndeposits have yielded remains of extinct and no longer indigenous\r\nmammals and relics of Palæolithic man--one of the most interesting\r\ndeposits from which mammalian remains have been obtained being the\r\nSands of Mosbach, between Wiesbaden and Mayence. The fauna in question\r\nis characteristically Pleistocene, nor can it be doubted that the\r\nMosbach Sands belong to the same geological horizon as the similar\r\nfluviatile deposits of the Seine, the Thames, and other river-valleys\r\nin western Europe. Dr. Kinkelin has shown,[BO] and with him Dr.\r\nSchumacher agrees,[BP] that the Mosbach deposits are of interglacial\r\nage; while Dr. Pohlig has no hesitation in assigning them to the same\r\nhorizon.[BQ] It is true there are no glacial accumulations in the\r\nregion where they occur, but they rest upon a series of unfossiliferous\r\ngravels which are recognised as the equivalents of the fluvio-glacial\r\nand glacial deposits of the Vosges, the Black Forest, the Alps, etc.\r\nThese gravels are traced at intervals up to considerable heights above\r\nthe Rhine, and contain numerous erratics, some of which are several\r\nfeet in diameter, while a large proportion are not at all water-worn,\r\nbut roughly and sharply angular. The blocks have unquestionably been\r\ntransported by river-ice, and imply therefore cold climatic conditions.\r\nThe overlying Mosbach Sands have yielded not only _Elephas antiquus_\r\nand _Hippopotamus major_, but the reindeer, the mammoth, and the\r\nmarmot--two strongly contrasted faunas, betokening climatic changes\r\nsimilar to those that marked the accumulation of the river-deposits\r\nof the Thames, the Seine, etc. Of younger date than the Mosbach Sands\r\nis another series of unfossiliferous gravels, which, like the older\r\nseries, are charged with ice-floated erratics. The beds at Mosbach are\r\nthus shown to be of interglacial age: they occupy the same geological\r\nhorizon as the interglacial beds of Switzerland and other glaciated\r\ntracts in central and northern Europe.\r\n\r\n[BO] Kinkelin: _Bericht über die Senckenberg. naturf. Ges. in Frankfurt\r\na. M._, 1889.\r\n\r\n[BP] Schumacher: _Mittheilungen d. Commission für d. geolog.\r\nLandes-Untersuch. v. Elsass-Lothringen_, Bd. ii., 1890, p. 184.\r\n\r\n[BQ] _Zeitschr. d. deutsch. geolog. Ges._, 1887, p. 806.\r\n\r\nTo this position must likewise be assigned the Pleistocene\r\nriver-alluvia of other districts. There is no other horizon, indeed,\r\non which these can be placed. That they are not of post-glacial age\r\nis shown by the fact that in many places the angular gravels and\r\nflood-loams of the Glacial period overlie them. And that they cannot\r\nall belong to pre-glacial times is proved by the frequent occurrence\r\nunderneath them of glacial or fluvio-glacial accumulations. It is\r\nquite possible, of course, that here and there in the valleys of\r\nwestern and southern Europe some of the Pleistocene alluvia may be of\r\npre-glacial age. But in the main these alluvia must be regarded as\r\nthe equivalents of the glacial and interglacial deposits of northern\r\nand Alpine districts. This will appear a reasonable conclusion\r\nwhen we bear in mind that long before the Pliocene period came to a\r\nclose the climate of Europe had begun to deteriorate. In England, as\r\nwe know, glacial conditions supervened almost at the advent of the\r\nPleistocene period. And the same was the case in the Alpine Lands of\r\nthe south. Again, in the glaciated areas of north and south alike, the\r\nclosing stage of the Pleistocene was characterised by cold climatic\r\nconditions. And thus in those regions the glacial and interglacial\r\nepochs were co-extensive with that period. It follows, therefore,\r\nthat the Pleistocene deposits of extra-glacial areas must be the\r\nequivalents of the glacial and interglacial accumulations elsewhere.\r\nIf we refused to admit this we should be puzzled indeed to tell what\r\nthe rivers of western and southern Europe were doing throughout the\r\nlong-continued Glacial period. There is no escape from the conclusion\r\nthat the Pleistocene river-alluvia and cave-accumulations must be\r\nassigned to the same general horizon as the glacial and interglacial\r\ndeposits. This is now admitted by Continental palæontologists who find\r\nin the character of Pleistocene organic remains abundant proof that\r\nthe old river-alluvia and cave-accumulations were laid down under\r\nchanging climatic conditions. Did neither glacial nor interglacial\r\ndeposits exist, the relics of the Pleistocene flora and fauna met with\r\nin extra-glacial regions would yet lead us to the conclusion that\r\nafter the close of the Pliocene period, extremely cold and very genial\r\nclimates alternated up to the dawn of the present. Thus during one\r\nstage of the Pleistocene \"clement winters and cool summers permitted\r\nthe wide diffusion and intimate association of plants which have\r\nnow a very different range. Temperate and southern species like the\r\nash, the poplar, the sycamore, the fig-tree, the judas-tree, etc.,\r\noverspread all the low-grounds of France as far north at least as\r\nParis. It was under such conditions that the elephants, rhinoceroses,\r\nhippopotamuses, and the vast herds of temperate cervine and bovine\r\nspecies ranged over Europe, from the shores of the Mediterranean up to\r\nthe latitude of Yorkshire, and probably even further north still, and\r\nfrom the borders of Asia to the western ocean. Despite the presence of\r\nnumerous fierce carnivora--lions, hyænas, tigers, and others--Europe\r\nat that time, with its shady forests, its laurel-margined streams,\r\nits broad and deep-flowing rivers--a country in every way suited\r\nto the needs of a race of hunters and fishers--must have been no\r\nunpleasant habitation for Palæolithic man.\" But during another stage\r\nof the Pleistocene period, the climate of our continent presented the\r\nstrongest contrast to those genial conditions. At that time \"the dwarf\r\nbirch of the Scottish Highlands, and the Arctic willow, with their\r\nnorthern congeners, grew upon the low-grounds of middle Europe. Arctic\r\nanimals, such as the musk-sheep and the reindeer, lived then, all the\r\nyear round, in the south of France; the mammoth ranged into Spain and\r\nItaly; the glutton descended to the shores of the Mediterranean; the\r\nmarmot came down to the low-grounds at the foot of the Apennines; and\r\nthe lagomys inhabitated the low-lying maritime districts of Corsica\r\nand Sardinia. The land and freshwater molluscs of many Pleistocene\r\ndeposits tell a similar tale: high alpine, boreal, and hyperborean\r\nforms are characteristic of those deposits in central Europe; even in\r\nthe southern regions of our continent the shells testify to a former\r\ncolder and wetter climate. It was during the climax of these conditions\r\nthat the caves of Aquitaine were occupied by those artistic men who\r\nappear to have delighted in carving and engraving.\"[BR] Such, in brief,\r\nis the testimony of the Pleistocene flora and fauna of extra-glacial\r\nregions. It is from the deposits in these regions, therefore, that\r\nwe derive our fullest knowledge of the life of the period. But a\r\ncomparison of their organic remains with those that occur in the\r\nglacial and interglacial deposits of alpine and northern lands shows\r\nus that the Pleistocene accumulations of glacial and extra-glacial\r\ncountries are contemporaneous--for there is not a single life-form\r\nobtained from interglacial beds which does not also occur in the\r\ndeposits of extra-glacial regions. The converse is not true--nor\r\nis that to be wondered at, for interglacial deposits have only been\r\nsparingly preserved. In regions liable to glaciation such superficial\r\naccumulations must frequently have been ploughed up and incorporated\r\nwith ground-moraine. It was only in the extra-glacial tracts that\r\nalluvia of interglacial age were at all likely to be preserved in\r\nany abundance. To appreciate fully the climatic conditions of the\r\nPleistocene period, therefore, it is necessary to combine the evidence\r\nderived from the glaciated areas with that obtained from the lands\r\nthat lay beyond the reach of the ice-plough. The one is the complement\r\nof the other, and this being so, it is obvious that any attempted\r\nexplanation of the origin of the Glacial period which does not fully\r\nrealise the importance of the interglacial phase of that period cannot\r\nbe accepted.\r\n\r\n[BR] _Prehistoric Europe_, p. 67.\r\n\r\nBut if the climatic changes of Pleistocene times are the most\r\nimportant phenomena which the geologist who essays to trace the\r\nhistory of that period is called upon to consider, he cannot ignore\r\nthe evidence of contemporaneous geographical mutations. These are so\r\ngenerally admitted, however, that it is only necessary here to state\r\nthe well-known fact that everywhere throughout the maritime tracts of\r\nthe glaciated lands of Europe and North America frequent changes in\r\nthe relative level of land and sea took place during Pleistocene and\r\npost-glacial times.\r\n\r\nI must now very briefly review the evidence bearing on the climatic\r\nconditions of post-glacial times. And first, let it be noted that the\r\nclosing stage of the Pleistocene period was one of cold conditions,\r\naccompanied in north-western Europe by partial depression of the land\r\nbelow its present level. This is shown by the late-glacial marine\r\ndeposits of central Scotland and the coast-lands of Scandinavia. The\r\nhistorical records of the succeeding post-glacial period are furnished\r\nchiefly by raised beaches, river- and lake-alluvia, calcareous tufas,\r\nand peat-bogs. An examination of these has shown that the climate, at\r\nfirst cold, gradually became less ungenial, so that the Arctic-alpine\r\nflora and northern fauna were eventually supplanted in our latitude by\r\nthose temperate forms which, as a group, still occupy this region. The\r\namelioration of the climate was accompanied by striking geographical\r\nchanges, the British Islands becoming united with themselves and the\r\nopposite coasts of the continent. The genial character of the climate\r\nat this time is shown by the great development of forests, the remains\r\nof which occur under our oldest peat-bogs. Not only did trees then grow\r\nat greater altitudes in these regions than is at present the case,\r\nbut forests ranged much further north, and flourished in lands where\r\nthey cannot now exist. In Orkney and Shetland, in the far north of\r\nNorway, and even in the Faröe Islands and in Iceland relics of this old\r\nforest-epoch are met with. In connection with these facts reference may\r\nbe made to the evidence obtained from certain raised beaches on both\r\nsides of the N. Atlantic, and from recent dredgings in the intervening\r\nsea. The occurrence of isolated colonies of southern molluscs in our\r\nnorthern seas, and the appearance in raised beaches of many forms which\r\nare now confined to the waters of more southern latitudes, seem to show\r\nthat in early post-glacial times the seas of these northern latitudes\r\nwere warmer than now. And it is quite certain that the southern forms\r\nreferred to are not the relics of any pre-glacial or interglacial\r\nimmigration. They could only have entered our northern seas after the\r\nclose of the Glacial period, and their evidence taken in connection\r\nwith that furnished by the buried trees of our peat-bogs, leads to the\r\nconclusion that a genial climate supervened after the cold of the last\r\nglacial epoch and of earliest post-glacial times had passed away.\r\n\r\nTo this genial stage succeeded an epoch of cold humid conditions,\r\naccompanied by geographical changes which resulted in the insulation\r\nof Britain and Ireland--the sea encroaching to some extent on what are\r\nnow our maritime regions. The climate was less favourable to the growth\r\nof forests, which began to decay and to become buried under widespread\r\naccumulations of growing peat. At this time glaciers reappeared in the\r\nglens of the Scottish Highlands, and here and there descended to the\r\nsea. The evidence for these is quite conspicuous, for the moraines are\r\nfound resting on the surface of post-glacial beaches. Thus my friend\r\nMr. L. Hinxman, of the Geological Survey, tells us that at the foot\r\nof Glen Thraill well-formed moraines are seen in section reposing on\r\nbeach-deposits at the distance of about three-quarters of a mile above\r\nthe head of Loch Torridon.[BS] The evidence of this recrudescence of\r\nglacial conditions in post-glacial times is not confined to Scotland. I\r\nbelieve it will yet be recognised in many other mountain-regions; but\r\nalready Prof. Penck has detected it in the valleys of the Pyrenees.[BT]\r\nDr. Kerner von Marilaun has also described similar phenomena in the\r\nhigher valleys of Tyrol, while Professor Brückner has obtained like\r\nevidence in the Salzach region.[BU]\r\n\r\n[BS] For Scottish post-glacial glaciers see J. Geikie: _Scottish\r\nNaturalist_, Jan., 1880; _Prehistoric Europe_, pp. 386,407; Penck:\r\n_Deutsche geographische Blätter_, Bd. vi., p. 323; _Verhand. d.

Jahresbericht d. geograph. Ges. v. Bern_, 1891.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere traced the history of the succeeding stages of the\r\npost-glacial period, and brought forward evidence of similar but less\r\nstrongly-marked climatic changes having followed upon those just\r\nreferred to, and my conclusions, I may add, have been supported by\r\nthe independent researches of Professor Blytt in Norway. But these\r\nlater changes need not be considered here, and I shall leave them out\r\nof account in the discussion that follows. It is sufficient for my\r\npresent purpose to confine attention to the well-proved conclusion\r\nthat in early post-glacial times genial climatic conditions obtained,\r\nand that these were followed by cold and humid conditions, during the\r\nprevalence of which considerable local glaciers reappeared in certain\r\nmountain-valleys.[BV]\r\n\r\n[BV] For a full statement of the evidence see _Prehistoric Europe_,\r\nchaps. xvi., xvii.\r\n\r\nWe speak of Pleistocene or Glacial and of Post-glacial periods as if\r\nthe one were more or less sharply marked off from the other. Of course,\r\nthat is not the case, and in point of fact it would be for many reasons\r\npreferable to include them under some general term. Taken together they\r\nform one tolerably well-defined cycle of time, characterised above all\r\nby its remarkable climatic changes--by alternations of cold and genial\r\nconditions, which were most strongly contrasted in the earlier stages\r\nof the period. It is further worthy of note that various oscillations\r\nof the sea-level appear to have taken place again and again both in the\r\nearlier and later stages of the cycle.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to inquire whether the phenomena we have been\r\nconsidering can be accounted for by movements of the earth's crust--a\r\nview which has recently received considerable support, more especially\r\nin America. I need hardly say that the view in question is no novelty.\r\nMany years ago, while our knowledge of the Pleistocene phenomena was\r\nsomewhat rudimentary, it was usual to infer that glaciation had been\r\ninduced by elevation of the land. This did not seem an unreasonable\r\nconclusion, for above our heads, at a less or greater elevation,\r\naccording to latitude, an Arctic climate prevails. One could not doubt,\r\ntherefore, that if a land-surface were only sufficiently uplifted\r\nit would reach the snow-line, and become more or less extensively\r\nglaciated. But with the increase of our knowledge of Pleistocene\r\nand post-glacial conditions, such a ready interpretation failed to\r\nsatisfy, although not a few geologists have continued to defend\r\nthe \"earth-movement hypothesis,\" as accounting fairly well for the\r\nphenomena of the Glacial period. By these staunch believers in the\r\nadequacy of that view, it has been pointed out that elevation might not\r\nonly lift lands into the region of eternal snow, but, by converting\r\nlarge areas of the sea-bed into land, would greatly modify the\r\ndirection of ocean-currents, and thus influence the climate. What might\r\nnot be expected to happen were the Gulf Stream to be excluded from\r\nnorthern regions? What would be the fate of the temperate latitudes of\r\nNorth America and Europe were that genial ocean-river to be deflected\r\ninto the Pacific across a submerged Isthmus of Panama? The possibility\r\nof such changes having supervened in Pleistocene times has often been\r\npresent to my mind, but I long ago came to the conclusion that they\r\ncould not account for the facts. Moreover, I have never been able to\r\nmeet with any evidence in favour of the postulated \"earth-movements.\"\r\nHaving carefully studied all that has been advanced of late years in\r\nsupport of the hypothesis in question I find myself more than ever\r\nconstrained to oppose it, not only because it is grounded on no basis\r\nof fact, but because it altogether fails to explain the conditions that\r\nobtained in Pleistocene and post-glacial times.\r\n\r\nThere are various forms in which the hypothesis has appeared, and these\r\nI shall now consider seriatim, and with such brevity as may be. It\r\nhas been maintained, for example, that at the advent of the Glacial\r\nperiod vast areas of northern and north-western Europe, together with\r\nenormous regions in the corresponding latitudes of North America, stood\r\nseveral thousand feet higher than at present. But when we ask what\r\nevidence can be adduced to prove this we get no satisfactory reply.\r\nWe are simply informed that a glacial climate must have resulted from\r\ngreat elevation, and that the latter, therefore, must have taken place\r\nat the beginning of the Glacial period. Some writers, however, have\r\nventured to give reasons for their faith. Thus Mr. W. Upham, pointing\r\nto the evidence of the fiords of North America, and to the fact that\r\ndrowned river-valleys have been traced outwards across the 100-fathoms\r\nline of the marginal plateau to depths of over 3500 feet, maintains\r\nthat the whole continent north of the Gulf of Mexico stood at the\r\ncommencement of the Glacial period some 3000 feet at least higher than\r\nnow. Of course he cites the fiords of Europe as evidence of a similar\r\ngreat upheaval for the northern and north-western regions of our\r\nContinent. Mr. Upham even favours the notion that during glacial times\r\na land-connection probably existed between North America and Europe,\r\nby way of the British Islands, Iceland, and Greenland. When \"this\r\nuplifting attained its maximum, and brought on the Glacial period,\" he\r\nsays, \"North America and north-western Europe stood 2500 to 3000 feet\r\nabove their present height.\"[BW]\r\n\r\n[BW] _American Geologist_, vi., p. 327.\r\n\r\nThat fiords are simply submerged land-valleys has long been recognised:\r\nthat they have been formed mainly by the action of running water--just\r\nin the same way as the mountain-valleys of Norway and Scotland--has\r\nbeen the belief for many years of most students of physical geology.\r\nBut it is hard to understand why they should have been cited by Mr.\r\nUpham in support of his contention, seeing that their evidence seems to\r\nmilitate strongly against the very hypothesis he strives to maintain.\r\nNo one acquainted with the physical features and geological structure\r\nof Scotland and Norway can doubt that the valleys which terminate\r\nin fiords are of great geological antiquity. Their excavation by\r\nfluviatile action certainly dates back to a period long anterior to\r\nthe advent of the Ice Age. And a like tale is told by the fiords and\r\ndrowned valley-troughs of North America, which cannot be referred to\r\nso recent a period as post-Tertiary times. Those who are convinced\r\nthat our continental areas have persisted throughout long æons of\r\ngeological time, and that rivers frequently have survived great\r\ngeological revolutions--cutting their way across mountain-elevations\r\nas fast as these were uplifted--will readily believe that some of the\r\nsubmarine river-troughs of North America, such as that of the Hudson,\r\nmay belong even to Secondary times.[BX] It would be hard to say at\r\nwhat particular date the excavation of the Scottish Highland valleys\r\ncommenced--but it was probably during the later part of the Palæozoic\r\nera. The process has doubtless been retarded and accelerated frequently\r\nenough, during successive movements of depression and elevation, but it\r\nwas practically completed before the beginning of Pleistocene times,\r\nand that is all that we may trouble about here. Precisely the same\r\nconclusion holds good for Norway: and such being the case it is obvious\r\nthat the question of the origin and age of the fiords has no bearing\r\non the problem of the glacial climate and its cause. In point of fact\r\nthe evidence, as already remarked, tells against the \"earth-movement\r\nhypothesis,\" for it shows us that, during a period when Europe and\r\nNorth America stood several thousand feet higher, and extended much\r\nfurther seawards, rivers, and not glaciers, were the occupants of our\r\nmountain-valleys. It was not until all those valleys had come to assume\r\nmuch the appearance they now present that general glaciation supervened.\r\n\r\n[BX] Professor Dana inclines to date the erosion of the Hudson trough\r\nso far back as the Jura-Trias period.--_American Journ. Science_, xl.,\r\np. 435.\r\n\r\nWe are not without direct evidence, however, as to the geographical\r\nconditions that obtained in the ages that immediately preceded the\r\nPleistocene period. The distribution of the Pliocene marine beds of\r\nBritain entitles us to assume that at the time of their accumulation\r\nour lands did not extend quite so far to the south and east as now.\r\nThe absence of similar deposits from the coast-lands of North America\r\nis supposed to support the view of great continental elevation in\r\npre-glacial times. All it seems to prove, however, is that in Pliocene\r\ntimes the North American continent was not less extensive than it is at\r\npresent. It is even quite possible that in glacial times pre-existing\r\nPliocene beds may have been ploughed out by the ice, just as seems to\r\nhave been the case in the north-east of Scotland. But without going so\r\nfar back as Pliocene times, we meet with evidence almost everywhere\r\nthroughout the maritime regions of the glaciated areas of Europe and\r\nNorth America, to show that immediately before those tracts became\r\nswathed in ice the geographical conditions were much the same as at\r\npresent. The shelly boulder-clays in various parts of our islands,\r\nand the similar occurrence of marine and brackish-water shells in and\r\nunderneath the Diluvium of north Germany, etc., prove clearly enough\r\nthat just before the coming-on of glacial conditions neither Britain\r\nnor the present maritime lands of the Continent were far removed\r\nfrom the sea. It is true that the buried river-channels of Scotland\r\nindicate a pre-glacial elevation of some 200 or 300 feet above the\r\nexisting sea-level, but it is quite certain that the Minch, St.\r\nGeorge's Channel, the Irish Sea, the North Sea, and the Baltic were all\r\nin existence at the commencement of the Glacial period. And we are led\r\nto similar conclusions with regard to the geographical conditions of\r\nNorth America at that time, from the occurrence of marine shells in the\r\nboulder-clays of Canada and New England. We note indeed that there is\r\nabundant evidence of land-submergence during glacial times. Indeed, we\r\nmay say that the Pleistocene marine deposits of northern latitudes are\r\nalmost invariably indicative of colder conditions than now obtain.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that cold climatic conditions were contemporaneous in\r\nour latitude with submergence, it is equally true that an extensive\r\nland-surface in north-west Europe has, sometimes at least, co-existed\r\nwith markedly genial conditions. In Tertiary times, for example, as\r\nthe Oligocene deposits of Scotland, the Faröe Islands, Iceland, and\r\nGreenland testify, a land-connection existed between Europe and the\r\nNorth American continent. Again, it has been shown that during the\r\ninterglacial phase of the Pleistocene period Britain was continental,\r\nand enjoyed at the time a peculiarly genial climate. And somewhat\r\nsimilar geographical and climatic conditions again supervened in\r\npost-glacial times. In other words, when the land was more elevated\r\nand extensive than now, it enjoyed a warmer climate. Nor can we escape\r\nthe conclusion that the excavation of the fiord-valleys of northern\r\nlatitudes, which is a very old story (far older than the Pleistocene),\r\nwas the work not of glaciers but of running water, at a time when\r\nnorth-western Europe and the corresponding regions of America were much\r\nmore elevated than they are now.\r\n\r\nThus there appears to be no evidence either direct or indirect in\r\nfavour of the view that glacial conditions were superinduced by\r\ngreat continental elevation. But it may be argued that even although\r\nno evidence can be cited in proof of such elevation, still, if\r\nthe glacial phenomena can be well explained by its means, we may\r\nbe justified in admitting it as a working hypothesis. Movements\r\nof elevation and depression have frequently taken place--the\r\nPleistocene marine deposits themselves testify to oscillations of\r\nthe sea-level--and there can be no objection, therefore, to such\r\npostulations as are made by the hypothesis under review. All this\r\nis readily granted, but I deny that the conditions that obtained in\r\nPleistocene times can be accounted for by elevation and depression. Let\r\nus see how the desiderated elevation of northern lands would work. Were\r\nnorth-western Europe and the corresponding latitudes of North America\r\nto be upheaved for 3000 feet, and a land-passage to obtain between the\r\ntwo continents by way of the Faröe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland,\r\nhow would the climate be affected? It is obvious that under such\r\nchanged conditions the elevated lands in higher latitudes might well\r\nbe subjected to more or less extensive glaciation. Norway would become\r\nuninhabitable and glaciers might well appear in the mountain-valleys\r\nof Scotland. But it may be doubted whether the climate of France and\r\nSpain, or the corresponding latitudes of North America, would be\r\nmuch affected. For were a land-passage to appear between Britain and\r\nGreenland no Arctic current would flow into the North Atlantic, while\r\nno portion of the Gulf Stream would be lost in Arctic seas. The North\r\nAtlantic would then form a great gulf round which a warm ocean-current\r\nwould circulate. The temperature of that sea, therefore, would be\r\nraised and the prevailing westerly and south-westerly winds of Europe\r\nwould be warmer than now. However much such warm moist winds might\r\nincrease the snow-fall in North Britain and Scandinavia, we cannot\r\nsuppose they could have much influence in central and southern Europe,\r\nand in North Africa; and still less could they affect the climate of\r\nAsia Minor and the mountainous regions of the far east, in most of\r\nwhich evidence of extensive glaciation occurs. And how, we may ask,\r\ncould the postulated geographical changes bring about the glaciation\r\nof the mountainous tracts on the Pacific sea-board? In fine, we may\r\nconclude that however much the geographical changes referred to might\r\naffect north-western Europe and north-eastern America, they are wholly\r\ninsufficient to account for the glacial phenomena of other regions.\r\nThe continuous research of recent years has shown that the lowering of\r\ntemperature of glacial times was not limited to the lands which would\r\nbe affected by any such elevation as that we are considering. A marked\r\nand general displacement of climatic zones took place over the whole\r\ncontinent of Europe; and similar changes supervened in North America\r\nand Asia. Are we then to suppose that all the lands within the Northern\r\nHemisphere were extensively and contemporaneously upheaved?\r\n\r\nWe may now consider another form of the \"earth-movement hypothesis.\"\r\nIt has frequently been suggested that our glacial phenomena may have\r\nbeen caused by the submergence of the Isthmus of Panama, and the\r\ndeflection of the Equatorial Current into the Pacific. But it may be\r\ndoubted whether a submergence of that isthmus, unless very extensive\r\nindeed, would result in more than a partial escape of Atlantic water\r\ninto the Pacific basin. The Counter Current of the Pacific which now\r\nstrikes against the isthmus might even sweep into the Caribbean Sea,\r\nand join the Equatorial on its way to the Gulf of Mexico. But putting\r\nthat consideration aside, what evidence have we that the Isthmus of\r\nPanama was submerged during the glacial epoch? None whatsoever, it\r\nmay be replied. It is only a pious opinion. Considerable movements of\r\nelevation and depression of the islands in the Caribbean Sea would seem\r\nto have taken place at a comparatively recent date, but those movements\r\nmay quite well belong to Pliocene times. Whether they be of Pliocene\r\nor Pleistocene age, however, no one has yet proved that the Isthmus of\r\nPanama was sufficiently submerged, either at the one time or the other,\r\nto permit the escape of the Atlantic Equatorial into the Pacific basin.\r\nBut let it be supposed that the isthmus has become so deeply submerged\r\nthat the Equatorial Current is wholly deflected, and that no Gulf\r\nStream issues through the Straits of Florida to temper the climate of\r\nhigher latitudes. What would result from such an unhappy change? Can\r\nany one conversant with the geographical distribution of the glacial\r\nphenomena imagine that the conditions of the Glacial period could be\r\nthus reproduced? Norway might indeed become a second south Greenland,\r\nand perennial snow and ice might appear in the mountainous tracts of\r\nthe British Islands. The climate of Hudson's Bay and the surrounding\r\nlands might be experienced in the Baltic and its neighbourhood, and\r\nwhat are now the temperate latitudes of Europe, north of the 50th\r\nparallel, would possibly approach Siberia in character. But surely\r\nthese changes are not comparable to the conditions of the Glacial\r\nperiod. The absence of a Gulf Stream would not sensibly affect the\r\nclimate of south-eastern Europe and Asia, and could not have the\r\nsmallest influence on that of the Pacific coast-lands of North America.\r\n\r\nYes, but if we conceive the submergence of the Isthmus of Panama\r\nto coincide with great elevation of northern lands, would not such\r\ngeographical conditions bring about a glacial epoch comparable to\r\nthat of Pleistocene times? It is hard to see how they could. No\r\ndoubt the climate of all those regions that would be affected by\r\nthe withdrawal of the Gulf Stream alone would become still more\r\ndeteriorated if they stood some 3000 feet higher than now. A vast area\r\nin the north-west of Europe would certainly be uninhabitable, but it\r\nis for the advocates of the \"earth-movement hypothesis\" to explain\r\nwhy those inhospitable regions should necessarily be covered with an\r\nice-sheet. For the production of great snow-fields and continental\r\nice-sheets, considerable precipitation, no less than a low temperature,\r\nis requisite. Under the conditions we have been imagining, however,\r\nprecipitation would probably be much less than it is at present. But\r\nto whatever extent north-west Europe might be glaciated, it is obvious\r\nthat the geographical revolutions referred to could have little\r\ninfluence on the climate of south-eastern Europe, not to mention\r\ncentral and eastern Asia. Nor could they possibly influence the climate\r\nof the Pacific coast-lands of North America. And yet, as is well\r\nknown, the climate of all those regions was more or less profoundly\r\naffected during the Glacial period. To account for the widespread\r\nevidences of glaciation by means of elevation it would therefore seem\r\nnecessary to infer that all the affected areas were in Pleistocene\r\ntimes uplifted _en masse_ into the Arctic zone that stretches above our\r\nheads. Now it seems easier to believe that the snow-line was lowered\r\nby several thousand feet than that the continents were elevated to the\r\nsame extent. Glaciation, as we have seen, was developed in the same\r\ndirections and over the same areas as we should expect it to be were\r\nthe snow-line to be generally depressed. To put it in another way,\r\nwere the snow-line by some means or other to be lowered over Europe,\r\nAsia, and North America, then, with sufficient precipitation, great\r\nice-fields and glaciers would reappear in the very regions which they\r\nvisited during Pleistocene times. Neither elevation nor depression\r\nof the land would be required to bring about such a result. Certain\r\nadvocates of the \"earth-movement hypothesis,\" however, do not maintain\r\nthat all the glaciated areas were uplifted at one and the same time.\r\nThe glaciation of the Alps, they think, may have taken place earlier\r\nor later than that of north-western Europe, while the ice-period of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains may not have coincided with that of eastern North\r\nAmerica. It is not impossible, they suppose, that the glaciation of the\r\nHimalayas may have been caused by an uplifting of that great chain,\r\nquite independent of similar earth-movements in other places. It can be\r\ndemonstrated, however, that the glaciation of the Alps and of northern\r\nEurope were contemporaneous, and the facts go far to prove that the\r\nglaciers of the Rocky Mountains and the inland-ice of north-east\r\nAmerica likewise co-existed. At all events all the old glacial\r\naccumulations of our hemisphere are of Pleistocene age, and it is for\r\nthe advocates of the hypothesis under review to prove that they are\r\nnot contemporaneous. Their doubts on the subject probably arise from\r\nthe simple fact that they are well aware how highly improbable or even\r\nimpossible it is that all those glaciated lands could have been pushed\r\nup within the snow-line at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nLet me, however, advance to another objection. We know that the\r\nGlacial period was interrupted by at least one interglacial epoch of\r\ntemperate and even genial conditions. Two glacial epochs with one\r\nprotracted interglacial epoch are now generally admitted. How do the\r\nsupporters of the \"earth-movement hypothesis\" explain this remarkable\r\nsuccession of climatic changes? Their views as to the cause of glacial\r\nconditions we have considered. If we can believe that the glacial\r\nphenomena were due to elevation of the land, then we need have no\r\ndifficulty in understanding how glacial conditions would disappear\r\nwhen the continents again subsided to a lower level. Not only did\r\nNorth America and Europe lose all their early glacial elevation, but\r\nby a lucky coincidence the Isthmus of Panama reappeared, and the Gulf\r\nStream resumed its beneficent course into the North Atlantic. This we\r\nare to suppose was the cause of the interglacial epoch. But I would\r\npoint out that the geographical conditions which are thus inferred to\r\nhave brought about the disappearance of the glacial climate, and to\r\nhave ushered in the interglacial epoch, are precisely those that now\r\nobtain--and, nevertheless, we are not yet in the enjoyment of a climate\r\nlike that of interglacial times. The strangely equable conditions that\r\npermitted the development of the remarkable Pleistocene flora and fauna\r\nare not experienced in the Europe of our day. And what about the second\r\nglacial epoch? Are we to suppose that once more the lands were greatly\r\nuplifted, and that convenient Isthmus of Panama was again depressed?\r\nDid the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the plateau of central France--in all\r\nof which we have distinct evidence of at least two glacial epochs--did\r\nthese heights, one may ask, rise up to bring about their earlier\r\nglaciation, sink down again to induce interglacial conditions, and\r\nonce more become uplifted at the succeeding cold epoch, to subside\r\neventually in order to cause a final retreat of their glaciers?\r\n\r\nBut the climatic changes to be accounted for were in all probability\r\nmore numerous and complex than those just referred to. Competent\r\nobservers have adduced unmistakable evidence of three epochs of\r\nglaciation in the Alpine Lands of Europe. And we are not without\r\ndistinct hints that similar changes have taken place in northern and\r\nwestern Europe. Nor in this connection can we ignore the evidence of\r\nseveral interglacial episodes which Mr. Chamberlin and others have\r\ndetected in the glaciated tracts of North America. Even this is not\r\nall, for the upholders of the \"earth-movement hypothesis\" have still\r\nfurther to account for the climatic oscillations of post-glacial times.\r\nIf it be hard enough to allow the possibility of one great movement\r\nof elevation having affected so enormous an area of our hemisphere,\r\nif we find it extremely difficult to believe either that one such\r\nwidespread movement, or that a multitude of local movements, each more\r\nor less independent of the other, could have lifted the glaciated\r\nregions successively within reach of the snow-line--we shall yet find\r\nit impossible to admit that such remarkable upheavals could be repeated\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nWe seem driven to conclude, therefore, that the \"earth-movement\r\nhypothesis\" fails to explain the phenomena of Pleistocene times. One\r\ncannot deny, indeed, that glaciation might be induced locally by\r\nelevation of the land. It is quite conceivable that mountains now\r\nbelow the limits of perennial snow might come to be ridged up to such\r\nan extent as to be capable of sustaining snow-fields and glaciers.\r\nAnd such local movements may possibly have happened here and there\r\nduring the long-continued Pleistocene period. But the glacial phenomena\r\nof that period are on much too grand a scale and far too widely\r\ndistributed to be accounted for in that way. And if the occurrence\r\nof even one glacial epoch cannot be thus explained, we may leave the\r\nsupporters of the \"earth-movement hypothesis\" to show us what light\r\nis thrown by their urim and thummim on the origin of succeeding\r\ninterglacial and glacial climates.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another physical condition of the Pleistocene and\r\npost-glacial periods which any adequate explanation must embrace. I\r\nrefer to the oscillation of sea-level, of which so many proofs are\r\nforthcoming. It is very remarkable that almost everywhere throughout\r\nthe maritime regions of formerly glaciated areas we find evidence of\r\nsubmergence. So commonly is this the case, that geologists have long\r\nsuspected that the connection between glaciation and submergence might\r\nbe one of cause and effect. The possible influence of great ice-sheets\r\nin disturbing the relative level of land and sea is a question,\r\ntherefore, of very great importance. It is one, however, which must be\r\nsolved by physicists. Croll and others have advocated the view that the\r\ngreat accumulations of ice of the Glacial period may have displaced\r\nthe earth's centre of gravity, and thus caused the sea to rise upon\r\nthe glaciated hemisphere. The various results arrived at by physicists\r\nare hardly comparable, because each has used different data, but it\r\nseems probable that we have in this view a _vera causa_ of oscillations\r\nof the sea-level. Another hypothesis would explain the rise of the\r\nsea as due to the attractive influence of the great ice-masses, but\r\nDr. Drygalski's and Mr. Woodward's elaborate investigations would\r\nseem to have demonstrated that this notion does not account for the\r\nfacts. Yet another speculation has been advanced. Mr. Jamieson has\r\nsuggested that the mere weight of the ice-sheets would suffice to\r\npress down the earth's crust into a supposed liquid substratum, and\r\nthis explanation has met with much acceptance. Unfortunately our\r\nknowledge of the condition of the earth's interior is so very limited\r\nthat we cannot be certain as to how the crust would be affected by\r\nthe weight of an ice-sheet. No doubt Mr. Jamieson's hypothesis gives\r\na specious explanation of certain geological phenomena, but if there\r\nbe no liquid substratum underlying a thin crust it cannot be true.\r\nAt present the prevalent view of physicists appears to be that the\r\nearth is substantially solid. Professor George Darwin has shown\r\nthat the prominent inequalities of the earth's surface could not be\r\nsustained unless the crust be as rigid as granite for a depth of 1000\r\nmiles. \"If the earth be solid throughout,\" he remarks, \"then at 1000\r\nmiles from the surface the material must be as strong as granite. If\r\nit be fluid or gaseous inside, and the crust 1000 miles thick, that\r\ncrust must be stronger than granite, and if only 200 or 300 miles in\r\nthickness, much stronger than granite.\" This conclusion is obviously\r\nstrongly confirmatory of Sir William Thomson's view, that the earth\r\nis solid throughout. But many geologists find it hard to account for\r\nthe convolutions of strata and other structural phenomena on the\r\nsupposition that the earth is entirely solid, and they are inclined,\r\ntherefore, to adopt the hypothesis of a sub-crust layer of liquid\r\nmatter. Whether this be actually the condition or not physicists must\r\nbe left to determine. All that we need note is, that if there be any\r\nforce in Professor Darwin's argument, it is obvious that the crust is\r\npossessed of great rigidity, and could not be readily deformed by the\r\nmere weight of an ice-sheet. According to Dr. Drygalski, however, the\r\npresence of an ice-sheet, by reducing the temperature of the underlying\r\ncrust, would bring about contraction, and in this way cause the surface\r\nto sink. When the ice-sheet had disappeared, then free radiation of\r\nearth-heat would be resumed, the depressed isogeotherms would rise,\r\nand a general warming of the upper portion of the lithosphere would\r\ntake place. But the space occupied by the depressed section, owing to\r\nthe spheroidal form of the earth, would be smaller than that which it\r\noccupied before sinking had commenced, and consequently when the ice\r\nvanished expansion of the crust would follow, and the land-surface\r\nwould then rise again. The whole question is one for physicists to\r\ndecide upon, but I may point out that if Drygalski's explanation be\r\nwell founded, then it is obvious that it throws no light upon the\r\norigin and subsequent disappearance of an ice-sheet. Somehow or other\r\nthis ice-sheet comes into existence, and the cooling and contracting\r\ncrust sinks below it; and that depressed condition of the glaciated\r\narea must continue so long as the ice-sheet remains unmelted.\r\nRe-elevation can only take place when, owing to some other cause or\r\ncauses, the climate changes and the ice-sheet vanishes.\r\n\r\nThose who advocate the \"earth-movement hypothesis\" as an explanation of\r\nthe origin of extensive glaciation have welcomed Mr. Jamieson's view as\r\nharmonising well with their conclusions. They contend, as we have seen,\r\nthat glacial conditions were induced by an extensive upheaval of the\r\ncrust in northern latitudes, accompanied by a depression of the Isthmus\r\nof Panama. They then proceed to point out that the ice-sheets brought\r\nabout their own dissolution by pressing down the crust, and introducing\r\nwith submergence a disappearance of glacial conditions. See now how\r\nmuch they take for granted. In the first place, they assume an amount\r\nof pre-glacial or early glacial elevation of northern regions for which\r\nnot a scrap of evidence can be adduced, while they can give no proof of\r\ncontemporaneous depression of the Isthmus of Panama. Next, relying on\r\nMr. Jamieson's hypothesis, they take for granted that the ice-sheets,\r\ncalled into existence by their postulated earth-movements, succeeded\r\nin depressing the earth's surface even below its present level. That\r\nis to say, the land, which, according to them, was in glacial times\r\nsome 3000 feet higher than now, sank down under the weight of its\r\nglacial covering for, say, 3600 feet in north-western Europe. In North\r\nAmerica, in like manner, all the pre-glacial elevation was lost--the\r\nland sinking below its present level for some 200 feet in New England,\r\nfor 520 feet at Montreal, for 1000 to 1500 feet in Labrador, and for\r\n1000 to 2000 feet in the Arctic regions. Now, even if we concede the\r\nreasonableness of Mr. Jamieson's hypothesis, and admit that a certain\r\ndegree of deformation may take place under the mere weight of an\r\nice-sheet, it is difficult to believe that the crust can be so readily\r\ndeformed as the supporters of the \"earth-movement hypothesis\" seem to\r\nimply. If it could yield so readily to pressure, one is at a loss to\r\nunderstand how a great ice-sheet could accumulate--the ice would simply\r\nfloat off as the land subsided. Take the case of north-western Europe.\r\nThe ice-sheet that covered Scotland did not attain, on the average,\r\n3000 feet in thickness, and yet we are to suppose that it was able to\r\ndepress the land for some 600 feet below its present level--that is to\r\nsay, for 3600 feet below its assumed pre-glacial elevation. Either the\r\nice depressed the crust to that remarkable extent, or the land upon\r\nwhich the ice accumulated was not nearly so high as the advocates of\r\nthe \"earth-movement hypothesis\" have supposed. But the average I have\r\ntaken for the thickness of the Scottish ice-sheet is excessive, for it\r\nwas only in the low-grounds that the _mer de glace_ attained such a\r\ndepth. A large part of our country, however, is mountainous, and the\r\nmountain-tops were, of course, not nearly so thickly mantled with ice\r\nas the valleys. And the same to even a larger extent holds good for the\r\nScandinavian peninsula. If we take the thickness of the Scandinavian\r\nice-sheet that coalesced with that of Scotland as 4000 feet, we shall\r\nbe over the mark. Now, I ask, is it possible to believe that a sheet\r\nof ice of that thickness actually pressed down the crust of the earth\r\nfor not less than 3600 feet? But if we accept the \"earth-movement\r\nhypothesis,\" as it has been recently advocated, that is what we must\r\nbelieve. If we cannot do so, then we cannot accept the assumption of\r\ngreat elevation of the land in pre-glacial and glacial times. Let me\r\nput the case shortly: if the glacial marine beds and raised beaches\r\nof the Atlantic borders of Europe and North America owe their origin\r\nto depression induced by the weight of an ice-sheet, then it is quite\r\ncertain that at the advent of glacial conditions the land could not\r\nhave been so highly elevated as the advocates of the \"earth-movement\r\nhypothesis\" suppose. But if we are to accept the notion of great\r\nelevation of the land, then we must conclude that the submergence\r\nto which the raised beaches testify cannot have been caused by the\r\npressure of ice-sheets.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to pursue this particular subject further, but\r\nbefore leaving it, attention may be drawn for a moment to the curious\r\nconclusion that the ice-sheets were self-destructive. One is left to\r\nguess at what particular stage the sinking process began, but if the\r\nearth's crust were as readily deformed as the extreme views I have\r\nbeen examining would compel one to imply, then depression must have\r\ncommenced almost immediately with the accumulation of snow and ice. The\r\nseveral ice-sheets must soon have attained their maximum thickness,\r\nand their disappearance must have been correspondingly rapid. And\r\nyet all the evidence goes to show that a glacial epoch endured for\r\na comparatively long time--for a time sufficient to account for a\r\nprodigious amount of rock-erosion, and for the accumulation of vast\r\nsheets of glacial débris and fluvio-glacial detritus.[BY]\r\n\r\n[BY] It must not be inferred from the above remarks that I deny the\r\npossibility of deformation of the crust having been induced by the\r\nold ice-sheets. The geological evidence is certainly suggestive of\r\nsuch having been the case. But I much doubt whether the sinking of the\r\nsurface was brought about by the mere weight of the ice pressing the\r\ncrust down into a subjacent liquid layer. Dr. Drygalski's explanation\r\nwould better account for the geological phenomena, but, according to\r\nRev. Osmond Fisher, it cannot be maintained.\r\n\r\nIf it be difficult to understand how the \"earth-movement hypothesis\"\r\ncan account for the origin of one glacial epoch, the difficulty is\r\nnot lessened when we remember that there are two or more such epochs\r\nto account for. And until the advocates of that hypothesis can\r\nfurnish us with some reliable evidence, they can hardly expect us to\r\nbelieve in their mysterious upheavals and depressions of northern\r\nand temperate regions, and in the no less wonderfully rhythmic\r\nmovements of the Isthmus of Panama. In fine, the views which I have\r\nbeen controverting seem to me to be untenable, inasmuch as they are\r\nfounded on mere assumptions, and do not even give a reasonable and\r\nintelligible explanation of the phenomena of glaciated regions, while\r\nthey practically ignore or leave unsolved the problem of interglacial\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nSome five-and-twenty years have now elapsed since my lamented friend\r\nand colleague, James Croll, published his well-known physical theory of\r\nthe Glacial period. That theory, as you all know, has been frequently\r\ncriticised by physicists and others, to whose objections Croll made\r\na final reply in his _Climate and Cosmology_. In that work he has\r\nsuccessfully defended his views, and even added considerably to the\r\nstrength of his general argument. I am not aware that since then any\r\nserious objections to Croll's theory have appeared. The only one indeed\r\nthat seems to have attracted attention is that which has been urged\r\nespecially by certain American geologists. Their belief is that the\r\nclose of the Glacial period must have taken place at a much more recent\r\ndate than Croll has inferred. And this belief of theirs is based upon\r\nvarious estimates which have been made as to the time required for the\r\nerosion of valleys and the accumulation of alluvial deposits since the\r\nGlacial period. Thus, according to Mr. Gilbert, the post-glacial gorge\r\nof Niagara, at the present rate of erosion, must have been excavated\r\nwithin 7000 years; while Mr. Winchell, from similar measurements of\r\nthe post-glacial erosion of the Falls of St. Anthony, concludes that\r\n8000 years have elapsed since the close of the Ice Age. I might cite\r\na number of similar estimates that tend to show that since the close\r\nof the Glacial period only 7000 or 10,000 years have elapsed. What\r\nwill archæologists say to this conclusion? We know that Egypt was\r\nalready occupied by a civilised people nearly 6000 years ago, and\r\ntheir marvellously advanced civilisation at that time presupposes,\r\naccording to Egyptologists, many thousands of years of development. Are\r\nwe, then, prepared to admit that the close of the Ice Age coincided\r\nwith the dawn of Egyptian civilisation? But all American observers are\r\nnot so parsimonious with regard to post-glacial time. Thus Professor\r\nSpencer has given the age of the Falls of Niagara as 24,000 years, and\r\nhe informed me recently that this does not represent half of the time\r\nsince the formation of the third great series of glacial deposits of\r\nthe Canadian uplands. In our own Continent similar estimates have been\r\nbased on the rate of erosion of river-valleys, the rate of accumulation\r\nof alluvial deposits, of peat-bogs, of stalagmite in caves, and what\r\nnot, with results that, to say the least, are rather discordant. The\r\nfact is that all such measurements and estimates, however carefully\r\nconducted and cautiously made, are in the nature of things unreliable.\r\nWe are insufficiently acquainted with all the factors of the problem\r\nto be solved, and I cannot therefore agree with those who attribute\r\nmuch weight to conclusions based on such uncertain data. Dr. Croll's\r\ntheory may eventually be modified, but I feel sure that it will not be\r\noverturned by the inconclusive and unsatisfactory estimates to which I\r\nhave referred. Moreover, opponents of that theory may be reminded that\r\nits truth does not rest on the accuracy of its author's conclusion as\r\nto the date of the last Ice Age. That periods of high eccentricity of\r\nthe earth's orbit have occurred is beyond all doubt, but whether the\r\nformulæ employed by Croll in calculating the date of the last great\r\ncycle can be relied upon for that purpose is quite another question.\r\nAt present, so far as I understand the facts, the glacial and the\r\ninterglacial phenomena are explained by the astronomical theory, and by\r\nno other. It gives a simple, coherent, and consistent interpretation of\r\nthe climatic vicissitudes of the Pleistocene and post-glacial periods,\r\nand in especial it is the only theory that throws any light on the very\r\nremarkable climates of interglacial times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial Succession in Europe.[BZ]\r\n\r\n[BZ] _Trans. Royal Soc. Edinburgh_, vol. xxxvii. (1892).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years geologists have recognised the occurrence of at least\r\ntwo boulder-clays in the British Islands and the corresponding\r\nlatitudes of the Continent. It is no longer doubted that these are the\r\nproducts of two separate and distinct glacial epochs. This has been\r\ndemonstrated by the appearance of intercalated deposits of terrestrial,\r\nfreshwater, or, as the case may be, marine origin. Such interglacial\r\naccumulations have been met with again and again in Britain, and they\r\nhave likewise been detected at many places on the Continent, between\r\nthe border of the North Sea and the heart of Russia. Their organic\r\ncontents indicate in some cases cold climatic conditions; in others,\r\nthey imply a climate not less temperate or even more genial than\r\nthat which now obtains in the regions where they occur. Nor are such\r\ninterglacial beds confined to northern and north-western Europe. In\r\nthe Alpine Lands of the central and southern regions of our Continent\r\nthey are equally well developed. Impressed by the growing strength of\r\nthe evidence, it is no wonder that geologists, after a season of doubt,\r\nshould at last agree in the conclusion that the glacial conditions of\r\nthe Pleistocene period were interrupted by at least one protracted\r\ninterglacial epoch. Not a few observers go further, and maintain that\r\nthe evidence indicates more than this. They hold that three or even\r\nmore glacial epochs supervened in Pleistocene times. This is the\r\nconclusion I reached many years ago, and I now purpose reviewing the\r\nevidence which has accumulated since then, in order to show how far it\r\ngoes to support that conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn our islands we have, as already remarked, two boulder-clays, of\r\nwhich the lower or older has the wider extension southwards, for it has\r\nbeen traced as far as the valley of the Thames. The upper boulder-clay,\r\non the other hand, does not extend south of the midlands of England.\r\nIn the north of England, and throughout Scotland and the major portion\r\nof Ireland, it is this upper boulder-clay which usually shows at the\r\nsurface. The two clays, however, frequently occur together, and are\r\nexposed again and again in deep artificial and natural sections, as\r\nin pits, railway-cuttings, quarries, river-banks, and sea-cliffs.\r\nSometimes the upper clay rests directly upon the lower; at other times\r\nthey are separated by alluvial and peaty accumulations or by marine\r\ndeposits. The wider distribution of the lower till, the direction of\r\ntransport of its included erratics, and the trend of the underlying\r\n_roches moutonnées_ and rock-striæ, clearly show that the earlier _mer\r\nde glace_ covered a wider area than its successor, and was confluent\r\non the floor of the North Sea with the Scandinavian ice-sheet. It was\r\nduring the formation of the lower till, in short, that glaciation in\r\nthese islands attained its maximum development.\r\n\r\nThe interglacial beds, which in many places separate the lower from the\r\nupper till, show that after the retreat of the earlier _mer de glace_\r\nthe climate became progressively more temperate, until eventually the\r\ncountry was clothed with a flora essentially the same as the present.\r\nWild oxen, the great Irish deer, and the horse, elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nand other mammals then lived in Britain. From the presence of such a\r\nflora and fauna we may reasonably infer that the climate during the\r\nclimax of interglacial times was as genial as now. The occurrence of\r\nmarine deposits associated with some of the interglacial peaty beds\r\nshows that eventually submergence ensued; and as the shells in some\r\nof the marine beds are boreal and arctic forms, they prove that cold\r\nclimatic conditions accompanied the depression of the land. To what\r\nextent the land sank under water we cannot tell. It may have been 500\r\nfeet or not so much, for the evidence is somewhat unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe upper boulder-clay of our islands is the product of another _mer de\r\nglace_, which in Scotland would seem to have been hardly less thick and\r\nextensive than its predecessor. Like the latter, it covered the whole\r\ncountry, overflowed the Outer Hebrides, and became confluent with the\r\nScandinavian inland-ice on the bed of the North Sea. But it did not\r\nflow so far to the south as the earlier ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that this later _mer de glace_ was succeeded in our\r\nmountain-regions by a series of large local glaciers, which geologists\r\ngenerally believe were its direct descendants. It is supposed, in\r\nshort, that the inland-ice, after retreating from the low-grounds,\r\npersisted for a time in the form of local glaciers in mountain-valleys.\r\nThis view I also formerly held, although there were certain appearances\r\nwhich seemed to indicate that, after the ice-sheet had melted away from\r\nthe Lowlands and shrunk far into the mountains, a general advance of\r\ngreat valley-glaciers had taken place. I had observed, for example,\r\nthat the upper boulder-clay is often well developed in the lower\r\nreaches of our mountain-valleys--that, in fact, it may be met with more\r\nor less abundantly up to the point at which large terminal moraines\r\nare encountered. More than this, I had noticed that upland valleys,\r\nin which no local or terminal moraines occur, are usually clothed and\r\npaved with boulder-clay throughout. Again, the aspect of valleys which\r\nhave been occupied by large local glaciers is very suggestive. Above\r\nthe point at which terminal moraines occur only meagre patches of till\r\nare met with on the bottoms of the valleys. The adjacent hill-slopes\r\nup to a certain line may show bare rock, sprinkled perchance with\r\nerratics and superficial morainic detritus; but above this line, if\r\nthe acclivity be not too great, boulder-clay often comes on again.\r\nThese appearances are most conspicuously displayed in the southern\r\nUplands of Scotland, particularly in south Ayrshire and Galloway, and\r\nlong ago they led me to suspect that the local glaciers into which\r\nour latest _mer de glace_ was resolved, after retreating continuously\r\ntowards the heads of their valleys, so as to leave the boulder-clay in\r\na comparatively unmodified condition, had again advanced and ploughed\r\nthis out, down to the point at which they dropped their terminal\r\nmoraines. Subsequent observations in the Highlands and the Inner and\r\nOuter Hebrides confirmed me in my suspicion, for in all those regions\r\nwe meet with phenomena of precisely the same kind. My friends and\r\ncolleagues, Messrs. Peach and Horne, had independently come to a\r\nsimilar conclusion; and the more recent work of the Geological Survey\r\nin the north-west Highlands, as they inform me, has demonstrated that\r\nafter the dissolution of the general ice-sheet underneath which the\r\nupper boulder-clay was accumulated, a strong recrudescence of glacial\r\nconditions supervened, and a general advance of great valley-glaciers\r\ntook place--the glaciers in many places coalescing upon the low-grounds\r\nto form united _mers de glace_ of considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe development of these large glaciers, therefore, forms a distinct\r\nstage in the history of the Glacial period. They were of sufficient\r\nextent to occupy all the fiords of the northern and western Highlands,\r\nat the mouths of which they calved their icebergs, and they descended\r\nthe valleys on the eastern slopes of the land into the region of the\r\ngreat lakes, at the lower ends of which we encounter their outermost\r\nterminal moraines. The Shetland and Orkney Islands and the Inner and\r\nOuter Hebrides at the same time nourished local glaciers, not a few\r\nof which flowed into the sea. Such, for example, was the case in\r\nSkye, Harris, South Uist, and Arran. The broad Uplands of the south\r\nwere likewise clothed with snow-fields that fed numerous glaciers.\r\nThese were especially conspicuous in the wilds of Galloway, but they\r\nappeared likewise in the Peeblesshire hills; and even in less elevated\r\ntracts they have left more or less well-marked traces of their former\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nIt is to this third epoch of glaciation that I would assign the\r\nfinal scooping out of our lake-basins and the completion of the deep\r\ndepressions in the beds of our Highland fiords. All the evidence,\r\nindeed, leads to the conviction that the epoch was one of long duration.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that what holds good for Scotland must, within\r\ncertain limits, hold good also for Ireland and England. In Wales and\r\nthe Cumberland lake district, and in the mountain-regions of the sister\r\nisland, we meet with evidence of similar conditions. Each of those\r\nareas has obviously experienced intense local glaciation subsequent to\r\nthe disappearance of the last big ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nAttention must now be directed to another series of facts which help\r\nus to realise the general conditions that obtained during the epoch\r\nof local glaciation. In the basin of the estuary of the Clyde, and at\r\nvarious other places both on the west and east coasts of Scotland,\r\noccur certain clays and sands, which overlie the upper boulder-clay,\r\nand in some places are found wrapping round the kames and osar of\r\nthe last great ice-sheet. These beds are charged with the relics of\r\na boreal and arctic fauna, and indicate a submergence of rather more\r\nthan 100 feet. In the lower reaches of the rivers Clyde, Forth, and\r\nTay the clays and sands form a well-marked terrace, and a raised\r\nsea-beach, containing similar organisms, occurs here and there on the\r\nsea-coast, as between Dundee and Arbroath, on the southern shores of\r\nthe Moray Firth, and elsewhere. When the terraces are traced inland\r\nthey are found to pass into high-level fluviatile gravels, which may\r\nbe followed into the mountain-valleys, until eventually they shade off\r\ninto fluvio-glacial detritus associated with the terminal moraines of\r\nthe great local glaciers. It is obvious, in short, that the epoch of\r\nlocal ice-sheets and large valley-glaciers was one also of partial\r\nsubmergence. This is further shown by the fact that in some places the\r\nglaciers that reached the sea threw down their moraines on the 100-feet\r\nbeach. It must have been an epoch of much floating ice, as the marine\r\ndeposits contain now and again many erratics, large and small, and are,\r\nmoreover, frequently disturbed and contorted as if from the grounding\r\nof pack-ice.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which I have thus briefly sketched suffice to show that\r\nthe epoch of local glaciation is to be clearly distinguished from that\r\nof the latest general _mer de glace_. I have long suspected, indeed,\r\nthat the two may have been separated by as wide an interval of time\r\nas that which divided the earlier from the later epoch of general\r\nglaciation. Again and again I have searched underneath the terminal\r\nmoraines, in the faint hope of detecting interglacial accumulations. My\r\nfailure to discover these, however, did not weaken my conviction, for\r\nit was only by the merest chance that interglacial beds could ever have\r\nbeen preserved in such places. I feel sure, however, that they must\r\noccur among the older alluvia of our Lowlands. Indeed, as I shall point\r\nout in the sequel, it is highly probable that they are already known,\r\nand that we have hitherto failed to recognise their true position in\r\nthe glacial series.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have no direct evidence to prove that a long interglacial\r\nepoch of mild conditions immediately preceded the advent of our local\r\nice-sheets and large valley-glaciers, yet the indirect evidence is so\r\nstrong that we seem driven to admit that such must have been the case.\r\nTo show this I must briefly recapitulate what is now known as to the\r\nglacial succession on the Continent. It has been ascertained, then,\r\nthat the Scandinavian ice has invaded the low-grounds of Germany on\r\ntwo separate occasions, which are spoken of by Continental geologists\r\nas the \"first\" and \"second\" glacial epochs. The earlier of these was\r\nthe epoch of maximum glaciation, when the inland ice flowed south into\r\nSaxony, and overspread a vast area between the borders of the North\r\nSea and the base of the Ural Mountains. This ice-sheet unquestionably\r\ncoalesced with the _mer de glace_ of the British Islands. Its\r\nbottom-moraine and the associated fluvio-glacial detritus are known\r\nin Germany as \"Lower Diluvium,\" and the various phenomena connected\r\nwith it clearly show that the inland-ice radiated outwards from the\r\nhigh-grounds of Scandinavia. The terminal front of that vast _mer de\r\nglace_ is roughly indicated by a line drawn from the south coast of\r\nBelgium round the north base of the Harz, and by Leipzig and Dresden\r\nto Krakow, thence north-east to Nijnii Novgorod, and further north to\r\nthe head-waters of the Dvina and the shores of the Arctic Sea near the\r\nTcheskaia Gulf.\r\n\r\nThe lower diluvium is covered in certain places by interglacial\r\ndeposits and an overlying upper diluvium--a succession clearly\r\nindicative of climatic changes. In the interglacial beds occur remains\r\nof _Elephas antiquus_ and other Pleistocene mammals, and a flora which\r\ndenotes a genial temperate climate. One of the latest discoveries\r\nof interglacial remains is that of two peat-beds lying between the\r\nlower and upper diluvium near Grünenthal in Holstein.[CA] Among the\r\nabundant plant-relics are pines and firs (no longer indigenous to\r\nSchleswig-Holstein), aspen, willow, white birch, hazel, hornbeam, oak,\r\nand juniper. Associated with these are _Ilex_ and _Trapa natans_, the\r\npresence of which, as Dr. Weber remarks, betokens a climate like that\r\nof western middle Germany. Amongst the plants is a water-lily, which\r\noccurs also in the interglacial beds of Switzerland, but is not now\r\nfound in Europe. The evidence furnished by this and other interglacial\r\ndeposits in north Germany shows that, after the ice-sheet of the lower\r\ndiluvium had melted away, the climate became as temperate as that now\r\nexperienced in Europe. Another recent find of the same kind[CB] is\r\nthe \"diluvial\" peat, etc., of Klinge, in Brandenburg, described by\r\nProfessor Nehring. These beds have yielded remains of elk (_Cervus\r\nalces_), rhinoceros (species not determined), a small fox (?), and\r\nMegaceros. This latter is not the typical great Irish deer, but a\r\nvariety (_C. megaceros_, var. _Ruffii_, Nehring). The plant-remains\r\ninclude pine, fir (_Picea excelsa_), hornbeam, warty birch (_Betula\r\nverrucosa_), various willows (_Salix repens_, _S. aurita_, _S. caprea_\r\n[?], _S. cinerea_), hazel, poplar (?), common holly, etc. It is worthy\r\nof note that here also the interglacial water-lily (_Cratopleura_) of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein and Switzerland makes its appearance. Dr. Weber\r\nwrites me that the facies of this flora implies a well-marked temperate\r\ninsular climate (Seeklima). The occurrence of holly in the heart of the\r\nContinent, where it no longer grows wild, is particularly noteworthy.\r\nThe evidence furnished by such a flora leads one to conclude that\r\nat the climax of the genial interglacial epoch, the Scandinavian\r\nsnow-fields and glaciers were not more extensive than they are at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[CA] _Neues Jahrbuch f. Min. Geol. u. Palæont._, 1891, ii., pp. 62,\r\n228; _Ibid._, 1892, i., p. 114.\r\n\r\n[CB] _Naturwissenschaftliche Wochenschrift_, Bd. vii. (1892), No. 4,\r\np. 31. The plants were determined by Dr. Weber, Professor Wittmack,\r\nand Herr Warnstorf. [More recent investigations have considerably\r\nincreased our knowledge of this flora. See _Naturwissenschaftliche\r\nWochenschrift_, Bd. vii. (1892), Nr. 24, 25. _Ausland_, 1892, Nr. 20;\r\n_Neues Jahrb. f. Min., etc._, 1893, Bd. i., p. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the upper diluvium, however, proves that such genial\r\nconditions eventually passed away, and that an ice-sheet again invaded\r\nnorth Germany. But this later invasion was not on the same scale as\r\nthat of the preceding one. The geographical distribution of the upper\r\ndiluvium and the position of large terminal moraines put this quite\r\nbeyond doubt. The boulder-clay in question spreads over the Baltic\r\nprovinces of Germany, extending south as far as Berlin,[CC] and west\r\ninto Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark. At the climax of this later\r\ncold epoch glaciers occupied all the fiords of Norway, but did not\r\nadvance beyond the general coast-line. Norway at that time must have\r\ngreatly resembled Greenland--the inland-ice covering the interior of\r\nthe country, and sending seawards large glaciers that calved their\r\nicebergs at the mouths of the great fiords. In the extreme south,\r\nhowever, the glaciers did not quite reach the sea, but piled up large\r\nterminal moraines on the coast-lands, which may be followed thence\r\ninto Sweden in an easterly direction by the lower end of Lake Wener\r\nand through Lake Wetter. A similar belt of moraines marks out the\r\nsouthern termination of the ice-sheet in Finland. Between Sweden and\r\nFinland lies the basin of the Baltic, which, at the epoch in question\r\nwas filled with ice, forming a great Baltic glacier. This glacier\r\noverflowed the Öland Islands, Gottland, and Öland, fanning out as it\r\npassed towards the south-west and west, so as to invade on the south\r\nthe Baltic provinces of Germany, while in the north it traversed the\r\nsouthern part of Scania, and overwhelmed the Danish islands as it\r\nspread into Jutland and Schleswig-Holstein. The course of this second\r\nice-sheet is indicated by the direction of transport of erratics, etc.,\r\nand by the trend of rock-striæ and _roches moutonnées_, as well as by\r\nthe position of its terminal and lateral moraines.\r\n\r\n[CC] Not quite so far south. There is no reason to believe that the\r\nice-sheet of the so-called Great Baltic Glacier advanced beyond the\r\nBaltic ridge. The upper boulder-clay south of that ridge is the\r\nground-moraine of an earlier glaciation--the equivalent of our upper\r\nboulder-clay. See note, page 324. Nov. 1, 1892.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the glacial succession which has been established by\r\ngeologists in Scandinavia, north Germany, and Finland. The occurrence\r\nof two glacial epochs, separated by a long interval of temperate\r\nconditions, has been proved. The evidence, however, does not show\r\nthat there may not have been more than two glacial epochs. There are\r\ncertain phenomena, indeed, connected with the glacial accumulations\r\nof the regions in question which strongly suggest that the succession\r\nof changes was more complex than is generally understood. Several\r\nyears ago Dr. A. G. Nathorst adduced evidence to show that a great\r\nBaltic glacier, similar to that underneath which the upper diluvium\r\nwas amassed, existed before the advent of the vast _mer de glace_ of\r\nthe so-called \"first glacial epoch,\"[CD] and his observations have\r\nbeen confirmed and extended by H. Lundbohm.[CE] The facts set forth by\r\nthem prove beyond doubt that this early Baltic glacier smoothed and\r\nglaciated the rocks in southern Sweden in a direction from south-east\r\nto north-west, and accumulated a bottom-moraine whose included\r\nerratics are equally cogent evidence as to the trend of glaciation.\r\nThat old moraine is overlaid by the lower diluvium--_i.e._, the\r\nboulder-clay, etc., of the succeeding vast _mer de glace_ that flowed\r\nsouth to the foot of the Harz--the transport of the stones in the\r\nsuperjacent clay indicating a movement from NNE. to SSW., or nearly\r\nat right angles to the trend of the earlier Baltic glacier. It is\r\ndifficult to avoid the conclusion that we have here to do with the\r\nproducts of two distinct ice-epochs. But hitherto no interglacial\r\ndeposits have been detected between the boulder-clays in question. It\r\nmight, therefore, be held that the early Baltic glacier was separated\r\nby no long interval of time from the succeeding great _mer de glace_,\r\nbut may have been merely a stage in the development of the latter.\r\nIt is at all events conceivable that before the great _mer de glace_\r\nattained its maximum extension, it might have existed for a time\r\nas a large Baltic glacier. I would point out, however, that if no\r\ninterglacial beds had been recognised between the lower and the upper\r\ndiluvium, geologists would probably have considered that the last great\r\nBaltic glacier was simply the attenuated successor of the preceding\r\ncontinental _mer de glace_. But we know this was not so; the two were\r\nactually separated by a long epoch of genial temperate conditions.\r\n\r\n[CD] \"Beskrifning. till geol. Kartbl. Trolleholm\": _Sveriges Geologiska\r\nUndersökning_, Ser. Aa., Nr. 87.\r\n\r\n[CE] \"Om de äldre baltiska isströmmen i södra Sverige\": _Geolog.\r\nFörening. i Stockholm Förhandl._, Bd. x., p. 157.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other facts that may lead us to doubt whether in the\r\nglacial phenomena of the Baltic coast-lands we have not the evidence\r\nof more than two glacial epochs. Three, and even four, boulder-clays\r\nhave been observed in east and west Prussia. They are separated, the\r\none from the other, by extensive aqueous deposits, which are sometimes\r\nfossiliferous. Moreover, the boulder-clays in question have been\r\nfollowed continuously over considerable areas. It is quite possible,\r\nof course, that all those boulder-clays may be the product of one\r\nepoch, laid down during more or less considerable oscillations of an\r\nice-sheet. In this view of the case the intercalated aqueous deposits\r\nwould indicate temporary retreats, while the boulder-clays would\r\nrepresent successive re-advances of one and the same _mer de glace_. On\r\nthe other hand, it is equally possible, if not more probable, that the\r\nboulder-clays and intercalated beds are evidence of so many separate\r\nglacial and interglacial epochs. We cannot yet say which is the true\r\nexplanation of the facts. But these being as they are, we may doubt if\r\nGerman glacialists are justified in so confidently maintaining that\r\ntheir lower and upper diluvial accumulations are the products of the\r\n\"first\" and \"second\" glacial epochs. Indeed, as I shall show presently,\r\nthe upper diluvium of north Germany and Finland cannot represent the\r\nsecond glacial epoch of other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it has been supposed that the glacial deposits of the\r\ncentral regions of Russia were accumulated during the advance and\r\nretreat of one and the same ice-sheet. In 1888, however, Professor\r\nPavlow brought forward evidence to show that the province of Nijnii\r\nNovgorod had been twice invaded by a general _mer de glace_. During the\r\nfirst epoch of glaciation the ice-sheet overflowed the whole province,\r\nwhile only the northern half of the same region was covered by the\r\n_mer de glace_ of the second invasion. Again, Professor Armachevsky\r\nhas pointed out that in the province of Tchernigow two types of\r\nglacial deposits appear, so unlike in character and so differently\r\ndistributed that they can hardly be the products of one and the same\r\nice-sheet. But until recently no interglacial deposits had been\r\ndetected, and the observations just referred to failed, therefore, to\r\nmake much impression. The missing link in the material evidence has\r\nnow happily been supplied by M. Krischtafowitsch.[CF] At Troïzkoje, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Moscow, occur certain lacustrine formations which\r\nhave been long known to Russian geologists. These have been variously\r\nassigned to Tertiary, lower glacial, post-glacial, and pre-glacial\r\nhorizons. They are now proved, however, to be of interglacial age,\r\nfor they rest upon and are covered by glacial accumulations. Amongst\r\ntheir organic remains are oak (_Quercus pedunculata_), alder (_Alnus\r\nglutinosa_, _A. incana_), white birch, hazel, Norway maple (_Acer\r\nplatanoides_), Scots fir, willow, water-lilies (_Nuphar_, _Nymphæa_),\r\nmammoth, pike, perch, _Anadonta_, wing-cases of beetles, etc. The\r\ncharacter of the plants shows that the climate of central Russia was\r\nmilder and more humid than it is to-day.\r\n\r\n[CF] _Bull. de la Soc. Impér. des Naturalistes de Moskau_, No. 4, 1890.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the upper and lower glacial deposits of central\r\nRussia cannot be the equivalents of the upper and lower diluvium of\r\nthe Baltic coast-lands. The upper diluvium of those regions is the\r\nbottom-moraine of the so-called great Baltic glacier. At the time that\r\nglacier invaded north Germany, Finland was likewise covered with an\r\nice-sheet, which flowed towards the south-east, but did not advance\r\nquite so far as the northern shores of Lake Ladoga. A double line of\r\nterminal moraines, traced from Hango Head on the Gulf of Finland,\r\nnorth-east to beyond Joensuu, puts this beyond doubt.[CG] The morainic\r\ndeposits that overlie the interglacial beds of central Russia cannot,\r\ntherefore, belong to the epoch of the great Baltic glacier. They are\r\nnecessarily older. In short, it is obvious that the upper and lower\r\nglacial accumulations near Moscow must be on the horizon of the lower\r\ndiluvium of north Germany. And if this be so, then it is clear that\r\nthe latter cannot be entirely the product of one and the same _mer de\r\nglace_. When the several boulder-clays described by Schröder and others\r\nas occurring in the Baltic provinces of Germany are reinvestigated,\r\nthey may prove to be the bottom-moraines of as many distinct and\r\nseparate glacial epochs.\r\n\r\n[CG] Sederholm, _Fennia_, i., No. 7; Frosterus, _ibid._, iii., No. 8;\r\nRamsay, _ibid._, iv., No. 2.\r\n\r\nIt may be contended that the glacial and interglacial deposits of\r\ncentral Russia are perhaps only local developments--that their evidence\r\nmay be accounted for by the oscillations of one single _mer de glace_.\r\nThis explanation, as already pointed out, has been applied to the\r\nboulder-clays and intercalated aqueous beds of the lower diluvium of\r\nnorth Germany, and the prevalent character of the associated organic\r\nremains makes it appear plausible. It is quite inapplicable, however,\r\nto the similar accumulations in central Russia. During the formation\r\nof the freshwater beds of Troïzkoje, no part of Russia could have\r\nbeen occupied by an ice-sheet; the climate was more genial and less\r\n\"continental\" than the present. Yet that mild interglacial epoch was\r\npreceded and succeeded by extremely arctic conditions. It is impossible\r\nthat such excessive changes could have been confined to central Russia.\r\nGermany, and indeed all northern and north-western Europe, must have\r\nparticipated in the climatic revolutions.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, as the evidence has been considered, we may conclude\r\nthat three glacial and two interglacial epochs at least have been\r\nestablished for northern Europe. If this be the case, then a\r\nsimilar succession ought to occur in our own islands; and a little\r\nconsideration of the evidence already adduced will suffice to show that\r\nit does. It will be remembered that the lower and upper boulder-clays\r\nof the British Islands are the bottom-moraines of two separate and\r\ndistinct ice-sheets, each of which in its time coalesced on the floor\r\nof the North Sea with the inland-ice of Scandinavia. It is obvious,\r\ntherefore, that our upper boulder-clay cannot be the equivalent of\r\nthe upper diluvium of the Baltic coast-lands, of Sweden, Denmark, and\r\nSchleswig-Holstein. De Geer and others have shown that while the great\r\nBaltic glacier was accumulating the upper diluvium of North Germany,\r\netc., the inland-ice of Norway calved its icebergs at the mouths of\r\nthe great fiords. Thus, during the so-called \"second\" glacial epoch of\r\nScandinavian and German geologists, the Norwegian inland-ice did not\r\ncoalesce with any British _mer de glace_. The true equivalent in this\r\ncountry of the upper diluvium is not our upper boulder-clay, but the\r\ngreat valley-moraines of our mountain-regions. It is our epoch of large\r\nvalley-glaciers which corresponds to that of the great Baltic ice-flow.\r\nOur upper and lower boulder-clays are on the horizon of the lower\r\ndiluvium of Germany and the glacial deposits of central Russia.\r\n\r\nIt will now be seen that the evidence in Britain is fully borne out\r\nby what is known of the glacial succession in the corresponding\r\nlatitudes of the Continent. I had inferred that our epoch of large\r\nvalley-glaciers formed a distinct stage by itself, and was probably\r\nseparated from that of the preceding ice-sheet by a prolonged interval\r\nof interglacial conditions. One link in the chain of evidence, however,\r\nwas wanting: I could not point to the occurrence of interglacial\r\ndeposits underneath the great valley-moraines. But these, as we have\r\nseen, form a well-marked horizon on the Continent, and we cannot doubt\r\nthat a similar interglacial stage obtained in these islands. We may\r\nfeel confident, in fact, that genial climatic conditions supervened on\r\nthe dissolution of the last great _mer de glace_ in Britain, and that\r\nthe subsequent development of extensive snow-fields and glaciers in our\r\nmountain-regions was contemporaneous with the appearance of the last\r\ngreat Baltic glacier.\r\n\r\nWe need not be surprised that interglacial beds should be well\r\ndeveloped underneath the bottom-moraine of that great glacier, while\r\nthey have not yet been recognised below the corresponding morainic\r\naccumulations of our Highlands and Uplands. The conditions in the\r\nlow-grounds of the Baltic coast-lands favoured their preservation,\r\nfor the ice in those regions formed a broad _mer de glace_, under\r\nthe peripheral areas of which sub-glacial erosion was necessarily\r\nat a minimum and the accumulation at a maximum. In our Scottish\r\nmountain-valleys, however, the very opposite was the case. The\r\nconditions obtaining there were not at all comparable to those that\r\ncharacterised the low-grounds of northern Germany, etc., but were quite\r\nanalogous to those of Norway, where, as in our own mountain-regions,\r\ninterglacial beds are similarly wanting. It is quite possible,\r\nhowever, that patches of such deposits may yet be met with underneath\r\nour younger moraines, and they ought certainly to be looked for. But\r\nwhether they occur or not in our mountain-valleys, it is certain\r\nthat some of the older alluvia of our Lowlands must belong to this\r\nhorizon. Hitherto all alluvial beds that overlie our upper boulder-clay\r\nhave been classified as post-glacial; but since we have ascertained\r\nthat our latest _mer de glace_ was succeeded by genial interglacial\r\nconditions, we may be sure that records of that temperate epoch will\r\nyet be recognised in such Lowland tracts as were never reached by the\r\nglaciers of the succeeding cold epoch. Hence, I believe that some of\r\nour so-called \"post-glacial\" alluvia will eventually be assigned to\r\nan interglacial horizon. Amongst these may be cited the old peat and\r\nfreshwater beds that rest upon the upper boulder-clay at Hailes Quarry,\r\nnear Edinburgh. To the same horizon, in all probability, belong the\r\nclays, with Megaceros, etc., which occur so frequently underneath\r\nthe peat-bogs of Ireland. An interesting account of these was given\r\nsome years ago by Mr. Williams,[CH] who, as a collector of Megaceros\r\nremains, had the best opportunity of ascertaining the nature of the\r\ndeposits in which these occur. He gives a section of Ballybetagh Bog,\r\nnine miles south-east of Dublin, which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. Boulder-clay.\r\n  2. Fine tenacious clay, without stones.\r\n  3. Yellowish clay, largely composed of vegetable matter.\r\n  4. Brownish clay, with remains of Megaceros.\r\n  5. Greyish clay.\r\n  6. Peat.\r\n\r\n[CH] _Geol. Mag._, 1881, p. 354.\r\n\r\nThe beds overlying the boulder-clay are evidently of lacustrine\r\norigin. The fine clay (No. 2), according to Mr. Williams, is simply\r\nreconstructed boulder-clay. After the disappearance of the _mer de\r\nglace_ the land would for some time be practically destitute of any\r\nvegetable covering, and rain would thus be enabled to wash down the\r\nfiner ingredients of the boulder-clay that covered the adjacent slopes,\r\nand sweep them into the lake. The clay formed in this way is described\r\nas attaining a considerable thickness near the centre of the old\r\nlake, but it thins off towards the sides. The succeeding bed (No. 3)\r\nconsists so largely of vegetable débris that it can hardly be called\r\na clay. Mr. Williams describes it as a \"bed of pure vegetable remains\r\nthat has been ages under pressure.\" He notes that there is a total\r\nabsence in this bed of any tenacious clay like that of the underlying\r\nstratum, and infers, therefore, that the rainfall during the growth\r\nof the lacustrine vegetation was not so great as when the subjacent\r\nclay was being accumulated. The remains of Megaceros occur resting on\r\nthe surface of the plant-bed and at various levels in the overlying\r\nbrownish clay, which attains a thickness of three to four feet. The\r\nlatter is a true lacustrine sediment, containing a considerable\r\nproportion of vegetable matter, interstratified with seams of clay\r\nand fine quartz-sand. According to Mr. Williams, it was accumulated\r\nunder genial or temperate climatic conditions like the present.\r\nBetween this bed and the overlying greyish clay (from 30 inches to\r\n3 feet thick) there is always in all the bog deposits examined by\r\nMr. Williams a strongly-marked line of separation. The greyish clay\r\nconsists exclusively of mineral matter, and has evidently been derived\r\nfrom the disintegration of the adjacent granitic hills. Mr. Williams\r\nis of opinion that this clay is of aqueo-glacial formation. This he\r\ninfers from its nature and texture, and from its abundance. \"Why,\"\r\nhe asks, \"did not this mineral matter come down in like quantity all\r\nthe time of the deposit of the brown clay which underlies it? Simply\r\nbecause, during the genial conditions which then existed, the hills\r\nwere everywhere covered with vegetation; when the rain fell it soaked\r\ninto the soil, and the clay being bound together by the roots of the\r\ngrasses, was not washed down, just as at the present time, when there\r\nis hardly any degradation of these hills taking place.\" He mentions,\r\nfurther, that in the grey clay he obtained the antler of a reindeer,\r\nand that in one case the antlers of a Megaceros, found embedded in\r\nthe upper surface of the brown clay, immediately under the grey clay,\r\nwere scored like a striated boulder, while the under side showed no\r\nmarkings. Mr. Williams also emphasises the fact that the antlers of\r\nMegaceros frequently occur in a broken state--those near the surface\r\nof the brown clay being most broken, while those at greater depths are\r\nmuch less so. He shows that this could not be the result of tumultuous\r\nriver-action--the elevation of the valley precluding the possibility\r\nof its receiving a river capable of producing such effects. Moreover,\r\nthe remains show no trace of having been water-worn, the edges of the\r\nteeth of the great deer being as sharp as if the animal had died but\r\nyesterday. Mr. Williams thinks that the broken state of the antlers\r\nis due to the \"pressure of great masses of ice on the surface of the\r\nclay in which they were embedded, the wide expanse of the palms of the\r\nantlers exposing them to pressure and liability to breakage; and even,\r\nin many instances, when there was 12 or 14 inches in circumference of\r\nsolid bone almost as hard and sound as ivory, it was snapped across.\"\r\nIt is remarkable that in this one small bog nearly one hundred heads of\r\nMegaceros have been dug up.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams' observations show us that the Megaceros-beds are\r\ncertainly older than the peat-bogs with their buried timber. When he\r\nfirst informed me of the result of his researches (1880), I did not\r\nbelieve the Megaceros-beds could be older than the latest cold phase\r\nof the Ice Age. I thought that they were later in date than our last\r\ngeneral _mer de glace_, and I think so still, for they obviously rest\r\nupon its ground-moraine. But since I now recognise that our upper\r\nboulder-clay is not the product of the last glacial epoch, it seems\r\nto me highly probable that the Megaceros-beds are of interglacial\r\nage--that, in short, they occupy the horizon of the interglacial\r\ndeposits of north Germany, etc. The appearances described by Mr.\r\nWilliams in connection with the \"grey clay\" seem strongly suggestive of\r\nice-action. Ballybetagh Bog occurs at an elevation of 800 feet above\r\nthe sea, in the neighbourhood of the Three Rock Mountain (1479 feet),\r\nand during the epoch of great valley-glaciers the climatic conditions\r\nof that region must have been severe. But without having visited the\r\nlocality in question I should hesitate to say that the phenomena\r\nnecessarily point to local glaciation. Probably frost, lake-ice, and\r\nthick accumulations of snow and _névé_ might suffice to account for the\r\nvarious facts cited by Mr. Williams.\r\n\r\nI have called special attention to these Irish lacustrine beds,\r\nbecause it is highly probable that the post-glacial age of similar\r\nalluvia occurring in many other places in these islands has hitherto\r\nbeen assumed and not proved. Now that we know, however, that a long\r\ninterglacial stage succeeded the disappearance of the last general\r\n_mer de glace_, we may feel sure that the older alluvia of our Lowland\r\ndistricts cannot belong exclusively to post-glacial times. The local\r\nice-sheets and great glaciers of our \"third\" glacial epoch were\r\nconfined to our mountain-regions; and in the Lowlands, therefore,\r\nwhich were not invaded, we ought to have the lacustrine and fluviatile\r\naccumulations of the preceding interglacial stage. A fresh interest now\r\nattaches to our older alluvia, which must be carefully re-examined in\r\nthe new light thus thrown upon them.\r\n\r\nTurning next to the Alpine Lands of central Europe, we find that\r\ngeologists there have for many years recognised two glacial epochs.\r\nHence, like their _confrères_ in northern Europe, they speak of\r\n\"first\" and \"second\" glacial epochs.[CI] Within recent years, however,\r\nProfessor Penck has shown that the Alps have experienced at least\r\nthree separate periods of glaciation. He describes three distinct\r\nground-moraines, with associated river-terraces and interglacial\r\ndeposits in the valleys of the Bavarian Alps, and his observations\r\nhave been confirmed by Professor Brückner and Dr. Böhm.[CJ] The same\r\nglacialists, I understand, have nearly completed an elaborate survey\r\nof the eastern Alps, of which they intend shortly to publish an\r\nextended account. The results obtained by them are very interesting,\r\nand fully bear out the conclusions already arrived at from their\r\nexploration of the Bavarian Alps.[CK] A similar succession of\r\nglacial epochs has quite recently been determined by Dr. Du Pasquier\r\nin north Switzerland.[CL] Nor is this kind of evidence confined to\r\nthe north side of the Alps. On the shores of Lake Garda, between\r\nSalò and Brescia, three ground-moraines, separated by interglacial\r\naccumulations, are seen in section. The interglacial deposits consist\r\nchiefly of loams--the result of sub-aërial weathering--and attain a\r\nconsiderable thickness. From this Penck infers that the time which has\r\nelapsed since the latest glaciation is less than that required for the\r\naccumulation of either of the two interglacial series--a conclusion\r\nwhich, he says, is borne out by similar observations in other parts of\r\nthe Alpine region.[CM]\r\n\r\n[CI] Morlot: _Bulletin de la Soc.

Fortunately, however, lignite beds and\r\nother deposits charged with plant remains are met with occupying a\r\nsimilar position, and from these we gather that during interglacial\r\ntimes the glaciers sometimes retired to the very heads of the\r\nmountain-valleys, and must have been smaller than their present\r\nrepresentatives. Of such interglacial plant-beds, which have been met\r\nwith in some twenty localities, the most interesting, perhaps, is the\r\nbreccia of Hötting, in the neighbourhood of Innsbruck.[CN] This breccia\r\nrests upon old morainic accumulations, and is again overlaid by the\r\nlater moraines of the great Inn glacier. From the fact that the breccia\r\nyielded a number of supposed extinct species of plants, palæontologists\r\nwere inclined to assign it to the Pliocene. Professor Penck, however,\r\nprefers to include it in the Pleistocene system, along with all the\r\nglacial and interglacial deposits of the Alpine Lands. According to\r\nDr. von Wettstein, the flora in question is not Alpine but Pontic. At\r\nthe time of the formation of the breccia the large-leaved _Rhododendron\r\nponticum_ flourished in the Inn Valley at a height of 1200 metres above\r\nthe sea; the whole character of the flora, in short, indicates a warmer\r\nclimate than is now experienced in the neighbourhood of Innsbruck. It\r\nis obvious, therefore, that in interglacial times the glaciers must\r\nhave shrunk back, as Professor Penck remarks, to the highest ridges of\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\n[CN] Penck: _Die Vergletscherung der deutschen Alpen_, p. 228.\r\n_Verhandl. d. k. k. geol.

More than twenty years ago Dr. Julien brought\r\nforward evidence to show that the region of the Puy de Dôme had\r\nwitnessed two glacial epochs.[CO] During the first of these epochs a\r\nlarge glacier flowed from Mont Dore. After its retreat a prolonged\r\ninterglacial epoch followed, during which the old morainic deposits\r\nand the rocks they rest upon were much eroded. In the valleys and\r\nhollows thus excavated freshwater beds occur which have yielded\r\nrelics of an abundant flora, together with the remains of _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_, _Rhinoceros leptorhinus_, etc. After the deposition of\r\nthese freshwater alluvia, glaciers again descended the valleys and\r\ncovered the interglacial beds with their moraines. Similar results have\r\nbeen obtained by M. Rames from a study of the glacial phenomenon of\r\nCantal, which he shows belong to two separate epochs.[CP] The interval\r\nbetween the formation of the two series of glacial accumulations must\r\nhave been prolonged, for the valleys during that interval were in some\r\nplaces eroded to a depth of 900 feet. M. Rames further recognises\r\nthat the second glacial epoch was distinguished by two advances of\r\nvalley-glaciers, separated by a marked episode of fusion. Dr. Julien\r\nhas likewise noted the evidence for two episodes of fusion during the\r\nfirst extension of the glaciers of the Puy de Dôme.\r\n\r\n[CO] _Des Phénomènes glaciaires dans le Plateau central de la France_,\r\n&c.; Paris, 1869.\r\n\r\n[CP] Bull. _Soc. géol. de France_, 1884; see also M. Boule, _Bull. de\r\nla Soc. philomath. de Paris_, 8^e sér. i., p. 87.\r\n\r\nTwo glacial epochs have similarly been admitted for the Pyrenees;[CQ]\r\nbut Dr. Penck some years ago brought forward evidence to show that\r\nthese mountains, like the Alps, have experienced three separate and\r\ndistinct periods of glaciation.[CR]\r\n\r\n[CQ] Garrigou: _Bull.

Erdkunde zu Leipzig_, 1883.\r\n\r\nWe may now return to Scotland, and consider briefly the changes that\r\nfollowed upon the disappearance of the local ice-sheets and large\r\nvalley-glaciers of our mountain-regions. The evidence is fortunately\r\nclear and complete. In the valley of the Tay, for example, at and below\r\nPerth, we encounter the following succession of deposits:--\r\n\r\n  6. Recent alluvia.\r\n  5. Carse-deposits, 45 feet above sea-level.\r\n  4. Peat and forest bed.\r\n  3. Old alluvia.\r\n  2. Clays, etc., of 100-feet beach.\r\n  1. Boulder-clay.\r\n\r\nThe old alluvia (3) are obviously of fluviatile origin, and show us\r\nthat after the deposition of the clays, etc., of the 100-feet beach\r\nthe sea retreated, and allowed the Tay and its tributaries to plough\r\ntheir way down through the marine and estuarine deposits of the\r\n\"third\" glacial epoch. These deposits would appear to have extended\r\nat first as a broad and approximately level plain over all the lower\r\nreaches of the valleys. Through this plain the Tay and the Earn cut\r\ntheir way to a depth of more than 100 feet, and gradually removed all\r\nthe material over a course which can hardly be less than 2 miles in\r\nbreadth below the Bridge of Earn, and considerably exceeds that in the\r\nCarse of Gowrie. No organic remains occur in the \"old alluvia,\" but\r\nthe deposits consist principally of gravel and sand, and show not a\r\ntrace of ice-action. Immediately overlying them comes the well-known\r\npeat-bed (4). This is a mass of vegetable matter, varying in thickness\r\nfrom a few inches up to 3 or 4 feet. In some places it seems to be\r\nmade up chiefly of reed-like plants and sedges and occasional mosses,\r\ncommingled with which are abundant fragments of birch, alder, willow,\r\nhazel, and pine. In other places it contains trunks and stools of oak\r\nand hazel, with hazel-nuts--the trees being rooted in the subjacent\r\ndeposits. It is generally highly compressed and readily splits into\r\nlaminæ, upon the surface of which many small reeds, and now and again\r\nwing-cases of beetles, may be detected. A large proportion of the woody\r\ndébris--twigs, branches, and trunks--appears to have been drifted. A\r\n\"dug-out\" canoe of pine was found, along with trunks of the same tree,\r\nin the peat at Perth. The Carse-deposits (5), consisting principally of\r\nclay and silt, rest upon the peat-bed. The occurrence in these deposits\r\nof _Scrobicularia piperata_ and oyster-shells leaves us in no doubt as\r\nto their marine origin. They vary in thickness from 10 up to fully 40\r\nfeet.[CS]\r\n\r\n[CS] For a particular account of the Tay-valley Succession, see\r\n_Prehistoric Europe_, p. 385.\r\n\r\nA similar succession of deposits is met with in the valley of the\r\nForth,[CT] and we cannot doubt that these tell precisely the same tale.\r\nI have elsewhere[CU] adduced evidence to show that the peat-bed, with\r\ndrifted vegetable débris, which underlies the Carse accumulations of\r\nthe Forth and Tay is on the same horizon as the \"lower buried forest\"\r\nof our oldest peat-bogs, and the similar bogs that occur in Norway,\r\nSweden, Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, Holland, etc. Underneath the\r\n\"lower buried forest\" of those regions occur now and again freshwater\r\nclays, charged with the relics of an arctic-alpine flora; and quite\r\nrecently similar plant remains have been detected in old alluvia at\r\nCorstorphine, near Edinburgh. When the beds below our older peat-bogs\r\nare more carefully examined, traces of that old arctic flora will\r\ndoubtless be met with in many other parts of these islands. It was\r\nthis flora that clothed north-western Europe during the decay of the\r\nlast district ice-sheets of Britain and the disappearance of the great\r\nBaltic glacier.\r\n\r\n[CT] _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._ 1883-84, p. 745; _Mem. Geol. Survey,\r\nScotland_, Explanation of Sheet 31.\r\n\r\n[CU] _Prehistoric Europe_, chaps. xvi., xvii.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the large valley-glaciers of this country was\r\naccompanied by a general retreat of the sea--all the evidence leading\r\nto the conviction that our islands eventually became united to the\r\nContinent. The climatic conditions, as evidenced by the flora of the\r\n\"lower buried forest,\" were decidedly temperate--probably even more\r\ngenial than they are now, for the forests attained at that time a much\r\ngreater horizontal and vertical range. This epoch of mild climate and\r\ncontinental connection was eventually succeeded by one of submergence,\r\naccompanied by colder conditions. Britain was again insulated--the\r\nsea-level in Scotland reaching a height of 45-50 feet above present\r\nhigh-water. To this epoch pertain the Carse-clays of the Forth and Tay.\r\nA few erratics occur in these deposits, probably betokening the action\r\nof floating ice, but the beds more closely resemble the modern alluvial\r\nsilts of our estuaries than the tenacious clays of the 100-feet\r\nterrace. When the Carse-clays are followed inland, however, they pass\r\ninto coarse river-gravel and shingle, forming a well-marked high-level\r\nalluvial terrace of much the same character as the yet higher-level\r\nfluviatile terrace which is associated in like manner with the marine\r\ndeposits of the 100-feet beach.\r\n\r\nOf contemporaneous age with the Carse-clays, with which indeed they are\r\ncontinuous, are the raised beaches at 45-50 feet. These beaches occur\r\nat many places along the Scottish coasts, but they are seldom seen at\r\nthe heads of our sea-lochs. When the sea stood at this level, glaciers\r\nof considerable size occupied many of our mountain-valleys. In the west\r\nthey came down in places to the sea-coast, and dropped their terminal\r\nmoraines upon the beach-deposits accumulating there. Thus, in Arran[CV]\r\nand in Sutherland,[CW] these moraines are seen reposing on the raised\r\nbeaches of that epoch. And I think it is probable that the absence of\r\nsuch beaches at the heads of many of the sea-lochs of the Highland\r\narea is to be explained by the presence there of large glaciers, which\r\nprevented their formation.\r\n\r\n[CV] _British Association Reports_ (1854): Trans. of Sections, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[CW] L. Hinxman: Paper read before Edin. Geol. Soc., April 1892.\r\n\r\nThus, there is clear evidence to show that after the genial epoch\r\nrepresented by the \"lower buried forest,\" a recrudescence of glacial\r\nconditions supervened in Scotland. Many of the small moraines that\r\noccur at the heads of our mountain-valleys, both in the Highlands and\r\nSouthern Uplands, belong in all probability to this epoch. They are\r\ncharacterised by their very fresh and well-preserved appearance.[CX] It\r\nis not at all likely that these later climatic changes could have been\r\nconfined to Scotland. Other regions must have been similarly affected.\r\nBut the evidence will probably be harder to read than it is with\r\nus. Had it not been for the existence of our \"lower buried forest,\"\r\nwith the overlying Carse-deposits, we could hardly have been able to\r\ndistinguish so readily between the moraines of our \"third\" glacial\r\nepoch and those of the later epoch to which I now refer. The latter, we\r\nmight have supposed, simply marked a stage in the final retreat of the\r\nantecedent great valley-glaciers.\r\n\r\n[CX] _Prehistoric Europe_ (chaps. xvi., xvii.) gives a fuller statement\r\nof the evidence.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere traced the history of the succeeding stages of\r\nthe Pleistocene period, and adduced evidence of similar, but less\r\nstrongly-marked, climatic changes having followed upon those just\r\nreferred to, and my conclusions have been supported by the independent\r\nresearches of Professor Blytt in Norway. But these later changes need\r\nnot be considered here. It is sufficient for my general purpose to\r\nconfine attention to the well-proved conclusion that after the decay\r\nof the last district ice-sheets and great glaciers of our \"third\"\r\nglacial epoch genial conditions obtained, and that these were followed\r\nby cold and humid conditions, during the prevalence of which glaciers\r\nreappeared in many mountain-valleys.\r\n\r\nWe have thus, as it seems to me, clear evidence in Europe of four\r\nglacial epochs, separated the one from the other by protracted\r\nintervals of genial temperate conditions. So far, one's conclusions\r\nare based on data which cannot be gainsaid, but there are certain\r\nconsiderations which lead to the suspicion that the whole of the\r\ncomplex tale has not yet been unravelled, and that the climatic\r\nchanges were even more numerous than those that I have indicated. Let\r\nit be noted that glacial conditions attained their maximum during\r\nthe earliest of our recognised glacial epochs. With each recurring\r\ncold period the ice-sheets and glaciers successively diminished in\r\nimportance. That is one of the outstanding facts with which we have\r\nto deal. Whatever may have been the cause or causes of glacial and\r\ninterglacial conditions, it is obvious that those causes, after\r\nattaining a maximum influence, gradually became less effective in their\r\noperation. Such having been the case, one can hardly help suspecting\r\nthat our epoch of greatest glaciation may have been preceded by an\r\nalternation of cold and genial stages analogous to those that followed\r\nit. If three cold epochs of progressively diminished severity succeeded\r\nthe epoch of maximum glaciation, the latter may have been preceded by\r\none or more epochs of progressively increased severity. That something\r\nof the kind may have taken place is suggested by the occurrence\r\nof the old moraine of that great Baltic glacier that preceded the\r\nappearance of the most extensive _mer de glace_ of northern Europe.\r\nThe old moraine in question, it will be remembered, underlies the\r\nlower diluvium. Unfortunately, the very conditions that attended the\r\nglaciation of Europe render it improbable that any conspicuous traces\r\nof glacial epochs that may have occurred prior to the period of maximum\r\nglaciation could have been preserved within the regions covered by the\r\ngreat inland-ice. Their absence, therefore, cannot be held as proving\r\nthat the lower boulder-clays of Britain and northern Europe are the\r\nrepresentatives of the earliest glacial epoch. The lowest boulder-clay,\r\nI believe, has yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\nIt is in the Alpine Lands that we encounter the most striking evidence\r\nof glacial conditions anterior to the epoch of maximum glaciation.\r\nThe famous breccia of Hötting has already been referred to as of\r\ninterglacial age. From the character of its flora, Ettinghausen\r\nconsidered this accumulation to be of Tertiary age. The assemblage of\r\nplants is certainly not comparable to the well-known interglacial flora\r\nof Dürnten. According to the researches of Dr. R. von Wettstein,[CY]\r\nthe Hötting flora has most affinity with that of the Pontic Mountains,\r\nthe Caucasus, and southern Spain, and implies a considerably warmer\r\nclimate than is now experienced in the Inn Valley. This remarkable\r\ndeposit, as Dr. Penck pointed out some ten years ago, is clearly of\r\ninterglacial age. His conclusions were at once challenged, on the\r\nground that the flora had a Tertiary and not a Pleistocene facies;\r\nconsequently, it was urged that, as all glacial deposits were of\r\nPleistocene age, this particular breccia could not be interglacial.\r\nBut in this, as in similar cases, the palæontologist's contention\r\nhas not been sustained by the stratigraphical evidence, and Dr.\r\nPenck's observations have been confirmed by several highly-competent\r\ngeologists, as by MM. Böhm and Du Pasquier. The breccia is seen in\r\nseveral well-exposed sections resting upon the moraine of a local\r\nglacier which formerly descended the northern flanks of the Inn\r\nValley, opposite Innsbruck, where the mountain-slopes under existing\r\nconditions are free from snow and ice. Nor is this all, for certain\r\nerratics appear in the breccia, which could only have been derived\r\nfrom pre-existing glacial accumulations, and their occurrence in this\r\naccumulation at a height of 1150 metres shows that before the advent of\r\nthe Hötting flora the whole Inn Valley must have been filled with ice.\r\nThe plant-bearing beds are in their turn covered by the ground-moraine\r\nof a later and more extensive glaciation. To bring about the glacial\r\nconditions that obtained before the formation of the breccia, the\r\nsnow-line, according to Penck, must have been at least 1000 metres\r\nlower than now; while, to induce the succeeding glaciation, the\r\ndepression of the snow-line could not have been less than 1200 metres.\r\nThese observations have been extended to many other parts of the Alps,\r\nand the conclusion arrived at by Professor Penck and his colleagues,\r\nProfessor Brückner and Dr. Böhm, is briefly this--that the maximum\r\nglaciation of those regions did not fall in the \"first\" but in the\r\n\"second\" Alpine glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n[CY] _Sitzungsberichte d. Kais. Acad. d. Wissensch. in Wien,\r\nmathem.-naturw. Classe_, Bd. xcvii. Abth. i., 1888.\r\n\r\nThe glacial phenomena of northern and central Europe are so\r\nsimilar--the climatic oscillations which appear to have taken place\r\nhad so much in common, and were on so grand a scale--that we cannot\r\ndoubt they were synchronous. We may feel sure, therefore, that the\r\nepoch of maximum glaciation in the Alps was contemporaneous with the\r\nsimilar epoch in the north. And if this be so, then in the oldest\r\nground-moraines of the Alps we have the records of an earlier glacial\r\nepoch than that which is represented by the lower boulder-clays of\r\nBritain and the corresponding latitudes of the Continent. In other\r\nwords, the Hötting flora belongs to an older stage of the Glacial\r\nperiod than any of the acknowledged interglacial accumulations of\r\nnorthern Europe. The character of the plants is in keeping with this\r\nconclusion. The flora has evidently much less connection with the\r\npresent flora of the Alps than the interglacial floras of Britain\r\nand northern Europe have with those that now occupy their place. The\r\nHötting flora, moreover, implies a considerably warmer climate than\r\nnow obtains in the Alpine regions, while that of our interglacial beds\r\nindicates a temperate insular climate, apparently much like the present.\r\n\r\nThe high probability that oscillations of climate preceded the advent\r\nof the so-called \"first\" _mer de glace_ of northern Europe must lead to\r\na re-examination of our Pliocene deposits, with a view to see whether\r\nthese yield conclusive evidence against such climatic changes having\r\nobtained immediately before Pleistocene times. By drawing the line of\r\nseparation between the Pleistocene and the Pliocene at the base of our\r\nglacial series, the two systems in Britain are strongly marked off\r\nthe one from the other. There is, in short, a distinct \"break in the\r\nsuccession.\" From the Cromer Forest-bed, with its abundant mammalian\r\nfauna and temperate flora, we pass at once to the overlying arctic\r\nfreshwater bed and the superjacent boulder-clay that marks the epoch of\r\nmaximum glaciation.[CZ] Amongst the mammalian fauna of the Forest-bed\r\nare elephants (_Elephas meridionalis_, _E. antiquus_), hippopotamus,\r\nrhinoceros, (_R. etruscus_), horses, bison, boar, and many kinds of\r\ndeer, together with such carnivores as bears, _Machærodus_, spotted\r\nhyæna, etc. The freshwater and estuarine beds which contain this\r\nextensive fauna rest immediately upon marine deposits (Weybourn\r\nCrag), the organic remains of which have a decidedly arctic facies.\r\nHere, then, we have what at first sight would seem to be another\r\nbreak in the succession. The Forest-bed, one might suppose, indicated\r\nan interglacial epoch, separating two cold epochs. But Mr. Clement\r\nReid, who has worked out the geology of the Pliocene with admirable\r\nskill,[DA] has another explanation of the phenomena. It has long been\r\nknown that the organic remains of the marine Pliocene of Britain\r\ndenote a progressive lowering of temperature. The lower member of the\r\nsystem is crowded with southern forms, which indicate warm-temperate\r\nconditions. But when we leave the Older and pass upwards into the\r\nNewer Pliocene those southern forms progressively disappear, while at\r\nthe same time immigrants from the north increase in numbers, until\r\neventually, in the beds immediately underlying the Forest-bed, the\r\nfauna presents a thoroughly arctic facies. During the formation of\r\nthe Older Pliocene with its southern fauna our area was considerably\r\nsubmerged, so that the German Ocean had then a much wider communication\r\nwith the seas of lower latitudes. At the beginning of Newer Pliocene\r\ntimes, however, the land emerged to some extent, and all connection\r\nbetween the German Ocean and more southern seas was cut off. When at\r\nlast the \"Forest-bed series\" began to be accumulated, the southern half\r\nof the North Sea basin had become dry land, and was traversed by the\r\nRhine in its course towards the north, the Forest-bed representing the\r\nalluvial and estuarine deposits of that river.\r\n\r\n[CZ] In some places, however, certain marine deposits (_Leda myalis_\r\nbed) immediately overlie the Forest-bed.\r\n\r\n[DA] _Mem. of Geol. Survey_, \"Pliocene Deposits of Britain.\" _See\r\npostea_, footnote, p. 317.\r\n\r\nMr. Reid, in referring to the progressive change indicated by the\r\nPliocene marine fauna, is inclined to agree with Professor Prestwich\r\nthat this was not altogether the result of a general climatic change.\r\nHe thinks the successive dying out of southern forms and the continuous\r\narrival of boreal species was principally due to the North Sea\r\nremaining fully open to the north, while all connection with southern\r\nseas was cut off. Under such conditions, he says, \"there was a constant\r\nsupply of arctic species brought by every tide or storm, while at the\r\nsame time the southern forms had to hold their own without any aid\r\nfrom without; and if one was exterminated it could not be replaced.\"\r\nDoubtless the isolation of the North Sea must have hastened the\r\nextermination of the southern forms, but the change could not have been\r\nwholly due to such local causes. Similar, if less strongly-marked,\r\nchanges characterise the marine Pliocene of the Mediterranean area,\r\nwhile the freshwater alluvia of France, etc., furnish evidence in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\nThe Cromer Forest-bed overlies the Weybourn Crag, the marine fauna of\r\nwhich has a distinctly Arctic facies. The two cannot, therefore, be\r\nexactly contemporaneous: the marine equivalents of the Forest-bed are\r\nnot represented. But Mr. Reid points out that several arctic marine\r\nshells of the Weybourn Crag occur also in the Forest-bed, while certain\r\nsouthern freshwater and terrestrial shells common in the latter are\r\nmet with likewise in the former, commingled with the prevailing arctic\r\nmarine species. He thinks, therefore, that we may fairly conclude that\r\nthe two faunas occupied adjacent areas. One can hardly accept this\r\nconclusion without reserve. It is difficult to believe that a temperate\r\nflora and mammalian fauna like those of the Forest-bed clothed and\r\npeopled eastern England when the adjacent sea was occupied by arctic\r\nmolluscs, etc. Surely the occurrence of a few forms, which are common\r\nto the Forest-bed and the underlying Crag, does not necessarily prove\r\nthat the two faunas occupied adjacent districts. Mr. Reid, indeed,\r\nadmits that some of the marine shells in the Forest-bed series may have\r\nbeen derived from the underlying Crag. Were the marine equivalents of\r\nthe Forest-bed forthcoming we might well expect them to contain many\r\nCrag forms, but the facies of the fauna would most probably resemble\r\nthat of the existing North Sea fauna. Again, the appearance in the\r\nWeybourn Crag of a few southern shells common to the Forest-bed does\r\nnot seem to prove more than that such shells were contemporaneous\r\nsomewhere with an arctic marine fauna. But it is quite possible that\r\nthey might have been carried for a long distance from the south;\r\nand, even if they actually existed in the near neighbourhood of an\r\narctic marine fauna, we may easily attach too much importance to their\r\nevidence.[DB] I cannot think, therefore, that Mr. Reid's conclusion is\r\nentirely satisfactory. After all, the Cromer Forest-bed rests upon the\r\nWeybourn Crag, and the evidence as it stands is explicable in another\r\nway. It is quite possible, for example, that the Forest-bed really\r\nindicates an epoch of genial or temperate conditions, preceded, as it\r\ncertainly was eventually succeeded, by colder conditions.\r\n\r\n[DB] The inference that the Forest-bed occupies an interglacial\r\nposition is strengthened by the evidence of certain marine deposits\r\nwhich immediately overlie it. These (known collectively as the _Leda\r\nmyalis_ bed) occur in irregular patches, which, from the character of\r\ntheir organic remains, cannot all be precisely of the same age. In one\r\nplace, for example, they are abundantly charged with oysters, having\r\nvalves united, and with these are associated other species of molluscs\r\nthat still live in British seas. At another place no oysters occur, but\r\nthe beds yield two arctic shells, _Leda myalis_ and _Astarte borealis_,\r\nand some other forms which have no special significance. Professor Otto\r\nTorell pointed out to Mr. Reid that these separate deposits could not\r\nbe of the same age, for the oyster is sensitive to cold and does not\r\ninhabit the seas where _Leda myalis_ and _Astarte borealis_ flourish.\r\nFrom a consideration of this and other evidence Mr. Reid concludes that\r\nit is possible that the deposits indicate a period of considerable\r\nlength, during which the depth of water varied and the climate changed.\r\nTwo additional facts may be noted: _Leda myalis_ does not occur in\r\nany of the underlying Pliocene beds, while the oyster is not found in\r\nthe Weybourn and Chillesford Crag, though common lower down in the\r\nPliocene series. These facts seem to me to have a strong bearing on\r\nthe climatic conditions of the Forest-bed epoch. They show us that the\r\noyster flourished in the North Sea before the period of the Weybourn\r\nCrag--that it did not live side by side with the arctic forms of that\r\nperiod--and that it reappeared in our seas when favourable conditions\r\nreturned. When the climate again became cold an arctic fauna (including\r\na new-comer, _Leda myalis_) once more occupied the North Sea.\r\n\r\nIf it be objected that this would include as interglacial what has\r\nhitherto been regarded by most as a Pliocene mammalian fauna,[DC] I\r\nwould reply that the interglacial age of that fauna has already been\r\nproved in central France. The interglacial beds of Auvergne, with\r\n_Elephas meridionalis_, rest upon and are covered by moraines,[DD] and\r\nwith these have been correlated the deposits of Saint-Prest. Again, in\r\nnorthern Italy the lignites of Leffe and Pianico, which, as I showed a\r\nnumber of years ago,[DE] occupy an interglacial position, have likewise\r\nyielded _Elephas meridionalis_ and other associated mammalian forms.\r\n\r\n[DC] _Elephas meridionalis_ is usually regarded as a type-form of the\r\nNewer Pliocene, but long ago Dr. Fuchs pointed out that in Hungary\r\nthis species is of quaternary age: _Verhandl. d. k. k. geolog.\r\nReichsanstalt_, 1879, pp. 49, 270. It matters little whether we\r\nrelegate to the top of the Pliocene or to the base of the Pleistocene\r\nthe beds in which this species occurs. That it is met with upon an\r\ninterglacial horizon is certain; and if we are to make the Pleistocene\r\nco-extensive with the glacial and interglacial series we shall be\r\ncompelled to include in that system some portion of the Newer Pliocene.\r\n\r\n[DD] Julien: _Des Phènoménes glaciaires dans le Plateau central_, etc.,\r\n1869. Boule: _Revue d'Anthropologie_, 1879.\r\n\r\n[DE] _Prehistoric Europe_, p. 306. Professor Penck writes me that he\r\nand the Swiss glacialist, Dr. Du Pasquier, have recently examined\r\nthese deposits, and are able to confirm my conclusion as to their\r\ninterglacial position.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, then--indeed it is generally admitted--that\r\nthe cold conditions that culminated in our Glacial period began to\r\nmanifest themselves in Pliocene times. Moreover, as it can be shown\r\nthat _Elephas meridionalis_ and its congeners lived in central Europe\r\nafter an epoch of extensive glaciation, it is highly probable that\r\nthe Forest-bed, which contains the relics of the same mammalian\r\nfauna, is equivalent in age to the early interglacial beds of France\r\nand the Alpine Lands. We seem, therefore, justified in concluding\r\nthat the alternation of genial and cold climates that succeeded the\r\ndisappearance of the greatest of our ice-sheets was preceded by\r\nanalogous climatic changes in late Pliocene times.\r\n\r\nI shall now briefly summarise what seems to have been the glacial\r\nsuccession in Europe:--\r\n\r\n               {1.

Take, for example, the\r\nsuccession in Scotland, and observe how each glacial epoch was preceded\r\nand apparently accompanied by partial submergence of the land:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Epoch of Greatest Mer de Glace_ (lower boulder-clay); British and\r\n       Scandinavian ice-sheets coalescent. Followed by wide land-surface\r\n       = Continental Britain, with genial climate. Submergence of land--to\r\n       what extent is uncertain, but apparently to 500 feet or so.\r\n\r\n  2. _Epoch of Lesser Mer de Glace_ (upper boulder-clay); British and\r\n       Scandinavian ice-sheets coalescent. Followed by wide land-surface\r\n       = Continental Britain, with genial climate. Submergence of land for\r\n       100 feet or thereabout.\r\n\r\n  3. _Epoch of Local Ice-sheets in Mountain Districts;_ glaciers here\r\n       and there coalesce on the low-grounds; icebergs calved at mouths of\r\n       Highland sea-lochs (moraines on 100-feet beach). Followed by wide\r\n       land-surface = Continental Britain, with genial climate. Submergence\r\n       of land for 50 feet or thereabout.\r\n\r\n  4. _Epoch of Small Local Glaciers_, here and there descending to sea\r\n       (moraines on 50-feet beach).\r\n\r\nThese oscillations of the sea-level did not terminate with the\r\nemergence of the land after the formation of the 50-feet beach. There\r\nis evidence to show that subsequent to the retreat of the small local\r\nglaciers (4) and the emergence of the land, our shores extended\r\nseawards beyond their present limits, but how far we cannot tell. With\r\nthis epoch of re-emergence the climate again became more genial, our\r\nforests once more attaining a greater vertical and horizontal range.\r\nSubmergence then followed (the 25 to 30-feet beach), accompanied\r\nby colder and more humid conditions, which, while unfavourable to\r\nforest-growth, tended greatly to increase the spread of peat-bogs. We\r\nhave no evidence, however, to show that small local glaciers again\r\nappeared. Finally the sea retired, and the present conditions ensued.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the submergence which preceded and probably\r\naccompanied the advent of the lesser _mer de glace_ (2) was greater\r\nthan that which heralded the appearance of the local ice-sheets (3),\r\nas that in turn exceeded the depression that accompanied the latest\r\nlocal glaciers (4). There would seem, therefore, to be some causal\r\nconnection between cold climatic conditions and submergence. This is\r\nshown by the fact that not only did depression immediately precede and\r\naccompany the appearance of ice-sheets and glaciers, but the degree of\r\nsubmergence bore a remarkable relation to the extent of glaciation.\r\nMany speculations have been indulged in as to the cause of this curious\r\nconnection between glaciation and depression; these, however, I will\r\nnot consider here. None of the explanations hitherto advanced is\r\nsatisfactory, but the question is one well deserving the attention of\r\nphysicists, and its solution would be of great service to geology.\r\n\r\nA still larger question which the history of these times suggests\r\nis the cause of climatic oscillations. I have maintained that the\r\nwell-known theory advanced by James Croll is the only one that seems\r\nto throw any light upon the subject, and the observations which have\r\nbeen made since I discussed the question at length, some fifteen years\r\nago, have added strength to that conviction. As Sir Robert Ball has\r\nremarked, the astronomical theory is really much stronger than Croll\r\nmade it out to be. In his recently-published work, _The Cause of an Ice\r\nAge_, Sir Robert says that the theory is so thoroughly well based that\r\nthere is no longer any ground for doubting its truth. \"We have even\r\nshown,\" he continues, \"that the astronomical conditions are so definite\r\nthat astronomers are entitled to direct that vigorous search be\r\ninstituted on this globe to discover the traces of those vast climatic\r\nchanges through which astronomy declares that our earth must have\r\npassed.\" In concluding this paper, therefore, I may shortly indicate\r\nhow far the geological evidence seems to answer the requirements of the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nFollowing Croll, we find that the last period of great eccentricity\r\nof the earth's orbit extended over 160,000 years--the eccentricity\r\nreaching its highest value in the earlier stages of the cycle. It is\r\nobvious that during this long cycle the precession of the equinox must\r\nhave completed seven revolutions. We might therefore expect to meet\r\nwith geological evidence of recurrent cold or glacial and genial or\r\ninterglacial epochs; and not only so, but the records ought to show\r\nthat the earlier glacial epoch or epochs were colder than those that\r\nfollowed. Now we find that the epoch of maximum glaciation supervened\r\nin early Pleistocene times, and that three separate and distinct\r\nglacial epochs of diminished severity followed. Of these three, the\r\nfirst would appear to have been almost as severe as that which preceded\r\nit, and it certainly much surpassed in severity the cold epochs of the\r\nlater stages. But the epoch of maximum glaciation, or the first of\r\nthe Pleistocene series, was not the earliest glacial epoch. It seems\r\nto have been preceded by one of somewhat less severity than itself,\r\nbut which nevertheless, as we gather from the observations of Penck\r\nand his collaborators, was about as important as that which came\r\nafter the epoch of maximum glaciation. Hence it would appear that the\r\ncorrespondence of the geological evidence with the requirements of\r\nthe astronomical theory is as close as we could expect it to be. Four\r\nglacial with intervening genial epochs appear to have fallen within\r\nPleistocene times; while towards the close of the Pliocene, or at the\r\nbeginning of the Pleistocene period, according as we choose to classify\r\nthe deposits, an earlier glacial epoch followed by genial interglacial\r\nconditions, supervened.\r\n\r\nIn this outline of a large subject it has not been possible to do more\r\nthan indicate very briefly the general nature of the evidence upon\r\nwhich the chief conclusions are based. I hope, however, to have an\r\nopportunity ere long of dealing with the whole question in detail.\r\n\r\n  [Note.--Since the original publication of this Essay, renewed\r\n  investigation and study have led me to conclude that the correlation\r\n  of the British and Continental glacial series is even more simple\r\n  than I had supposed. I believe the use of the terms \"Lower\"\r\n  and \"Upper\" in connection with the \"Diluvial\" deposits of the\r\n  Continent has hitherto blinded us to the obvious succession of\r\n  the boulder-clays. In Britain we have, as shown above, a \"lower\r\n  boulder-clay,\" an \"upper boulder-clay,\" and the still younger\r\n  boulder-clays (ground-moraines), and terminal moraines of our\r\n  district ice-sheets and valley-glaciers. In the low-grounds of\r\n  the Continent the succession is precisely similar. Thus the lower\r\n  boulder-clay that sweeps south into Saxony represents the lower\r\n  boulder-clay of Britain. In like manner, the upper boulder-clay of\r\n  western and middle Germany, of Poland, and western and north-western\r\n  Russia, is the equivalent of our own upper boulder-clay. Lastly, the\r\n  so-called \"upper diluvium\" and the great terminal moraines of the\r\n  Baltic coast-lands are on the horizon of the younger boulder-clays\r\n  and terminal moraines of the mountainous areas of the British\r\n  Islands. The so-called \"lower diluvium\" of the Baltic coast-lands\r\n  thus represents not the _lower_ but the _upper_ diluvium of western\r\n  and middle Germany, Poland, etc. German geologists are of opinion\r\n  that the upper boulder-clays of the Baltic coast-lands and of the\r\n  valley of the Elbe are the ground-moraines of one and the same\r\n  ice-sheet, which, on its retreat, piled up the terminal moraines\r\n  of the Baltic Ridge. I believe the two boulder-clays in question\r\n  are quite distinct, and that the terminal moraines referred to\r\n  mark the furthest advance of the last great Baltic glacier. The\r\n  contemporaneity of the two boulder-clays has been taken for granted\r\n  simply because they are each underlaid by a lower boulder-clay. But,\r\n  as we have seen, the upper boulder-clay of the Baltic coast-lands is\r\n  underlaid not by one only, but by two, and in some places even by\r\n  three other boulder-clays--phenomena which never present themselves\r\n  in the regions not invaded by the last great Baltic glacier. Three\r\n  or four boulder-clays occur in the coast-lands of the Baltic because\r\n  those regions were overflowed successively by three or four separate\r\n  ice-sheets. Only two boulder-clays are met with south and east of\r\n  the Baltic Ridge, because the tracts lying south and south-east of\r\n  that ridge were traversed by only two _mers de glace_--namely, by\r\n  that of the epoch of maximum glaciation and by the less extensive\r\n  ice-sheet of the next succeeding cold period. In the region between\r\n  the Elbe and the mountains of middle Germany only one boulder-clay\r\n  appears, because that region has never been invaded by more than\r\n  one ice-sheet. The succession thus indicated may be tabulated as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Epoch of Earliest Baltic Glacier._ Lowest boulder-clay of\r\n       southern Sweden; lowest boulder-clay of Baltic provinces of\r\n       Prussia; horizon of the Weybourn Crag.\r\n\r\n  2. _Epoch of Greatest Mer de Glace._ Lower boulder-clays of middle\r\n  and southern Germany, central Russia, British Islands; second\r\n  boulder-clay of Baltic provinces of Prussia.\r\n\r\n  3. _Epoch of Lesser Mer de Glace._ Upper boulder-clay of western and\r\n  middle Germany, Poland, and west central Russia; upper boulder-clay\r\n  of Britain; third boulder-clay of Baltic provinces of Prussia.\r\n\r\n  4. _Epoch of Last Great Baltic Glacier._ Upper boulder-clay and\r\n  terminal moraines of Baltic coast-lands; district and valley-moraines\r\n  of Highlands and Uplands of British Islands.\r\n\r\n  5. _Epoch of Small Local Glaciers._ Valley-moraines in mountainous\r\n  regions of Britain, etc.\r\n\r\n  The evidence on which these conclusions are based is set forth at some\r\n  length in a forthcoming re-issue of my _Great Ice Age_.--Nov. 1, 1892.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                               PLATE IV\r\n\r\n        SKETCH MAP OF NORTHERN EUROPE SHOWING AREAS COVERED BY\r\n  ICE DURING THE EPOCH OF MAXIMUM GLACIATION, AND BY THE GREAT BALTIC\r\n     GLACIER AND THE LOCAL ICE-SHEETS OF BRITAIN AT A LATER DATE.\r\n\r\n  The Edinburgh Geographical Institute     J.

Every rock beneath our feet has its\r\nstory of change to tell us. Mountains, valleys, and plains, continents\r\nand islands, have passed through vicissitudes innumerable, and bear\r\nwithin them the evidence of a gradual development or evolution. Looking\r\nback through the vista of the past one sees the dry lands gradually\r\nseparating from the ocean, and gathering together into continental\r\nmasses according to a definite plan. It is this slow growth, this\r\naugust evolution, carried on through countless æons, which most\r\nimpresses the student of physical geology. The earth seems for the time\r\nas if endowed with life, and like a plant or animal to pass through its\r\nsuccessive stages of development until it culminates in the present\r\nbeautiful world. This conception is one of comparatively recent growth\r\nin the history of geological science. Hutton, the father of physical\r\ngeology, had indeed clearly perceived that the dry lands of the globe\r\nwere largely composed of the débris of former land-surfaces--that\r\nthere had been alternate elevations and depressions of the earth's\r\ncrust, causing now sea and now land to predominate over given areas.\r\nBut the facts known in this day could not possibly have suggested\r\nthose modern ideas of geographical evolution, which are the outcome\r\nof the multifarious observation and research of later years. It is to\r\nProfessor Dana, the eminent American geologist, that we are indebted\r\nfor the first clear enunciation of the views which I am now about to\r\nillustrate. According to him the great oceanic basins and continental\r\nridges are of primeval antiquity--their origin is older than that\r\nof our oldest sedimentary formations. It is not maintained that the\r\npresent lands have always continued above the level of the sea. On the\r\ncontrary, it can be proved that many oscillations of level have taken\r\nplace within each continental area, by which the extent and outline\r\nof the land have been modified again and again. Notwithstanding such\r\nchanges, however, the great continental ridges would appear to have\r\npersisted from the earliest geological times as dominant elevations of\r\nthe earth's crust. Some portions of these, as Dana remarks, may have\r\nbeen submerged for thousands of feet, but the continents have never\r\nchanged places with the oceans.\r\n\r\nI shall presently indicate the nature of the evidence by which it is\r\nsought to prove the vast age of our continental masses, but before\r\ndoing so it will be well to give an outline of the facts which go to\r\nshow that the oceanic depressions of the globe are likewise of primeval\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nThe memorable voyage of the _Challenger_ has done much to increase\r\nour knowledge of the deep seas and the accumulations forming therein.\r\nThe researches of the scientific staff of the expedition, and more\r\nparticularly those of Mr. Murray, have indeed given a new impulse\r\nto the study of the larger questions of physical geology, and have\r\nlent strong support to the doctrine of the permanence of the oceanic\r\nbasins and continental ridges. One of the most important facts brought\r\nbefore our attention by Mr. Murray is the absence of any land-derived\r\nmaterials from the sediments now gathering in the deeper abysses of the\r\nocean. The coasts of continents and continental islands are strewn, as\r\nevery one knows, with the wreck of the land--with gravel, sand, and\r\nmud, derived from the demolition of our rocks and soils. The coarser\r\ndébris accumulates upon beaches and in shallow littoral waters, while\r\nthe finer materials are swept further out to sea by tidal and other\r\ncurrents--the sediment being gradually sifted as it is borne outwards\r\ninto deeper water, until only the finest mud and silt remain to be\r\nswept forward. As the floor of the ocean shelves down to greater depths\r\nthe transporting power of currents gradually lessens, and finally\r\nland-derived sediment ceases to appear. Such terrigenous materials\r\nmay be said to extend from the littoral zone down to depths of 2000\r\nfeet and more, and to a distance of 60 to 300 miles from shore. They\r\nare confined, therefore, to a comparatively narrow belt round the\r\nmargins of continents and islands. And thus there are vast regions\r\nof the oceanic depressions over which no terrigenous or land-derived\r\nmaterials are accumulating. Instead of these we meet with a remarkable\r\nred clay and various kinds of ooze, made up largely of the shells of\r\nforaminifera, pelagic mollusca, and radiolarians, and the frustules\r\nof diatoms. The red clay is the most widely distributed of abysmal\r\ndeposits. Indeed, it seems to form a certain proportion of all the\r\ndeep-sea organic oozes, and may be said, therefore, to exist everywhere\r\nin the abysmal regions of the oceanic basins. It is extremely\r\nfine-grained, and owes its deep brown or red colour to the presence of\r\nthe oxides of manganese and iron. Scattered through the deposit occur\r\nparticles of various minerals of volcanic origin, together with lapilli\r\nand fragments of pumice, _i.e._, volcanic _ejectamenta_. Such materials\r\nmay have been thrown out from terrestrial volcanoes and carried by\r\nthe winds or floated by currents until they became water-logged and\r\nsank; or they may to some extent be the relics of submarine eruptions.\r\nWhatever may have been their immediate source, they are unquestionably\r\nof volcanic origin, and are not associated with any truly terrigenous\r\nsediment. The red clay is evidently the result of the chemical action\r\nof sea-water on volcanic products; and many facts conspire to show\r\nthat its formation is an extremely slow process. Thus, remains of\r\nvertebrates, consisting of the ear-bones of whales, beaks of ziphius,\r\nand teeth of sharks, are often plentifully present, and there is no\r\nreason to suppose, as MM. Murray and Renard point out, that the parts\r\nof the ocean where these remains occur are more frequented by whales\r\nand sharks than other regions where similar relics are rarely or never\r\ndredged up. Of these remains some have all the appearance of having\r\nlain upon the sea-bottom for a very long time, for they belong to\r\nextinct species, and are either partially coated or entirely surrounded\r\nwith thick layers of manganese-iron. In the same red clay occur small\r\nmetallic spherules which are of cosmic origin--in other words, meteoric\r\ndust. The accumulation of all these substances in such relatively great\r\nabundance shows us that the oceanic basins have remained unchanged for\r\na vast period of time, and assures us that the formation of the abysmal\r\nred clay is extremely slow.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to examine the rocks which enter into the framework of\r\nour continents, we find that they may be roughly classed under these\r\nheads:--\r\n\r\n  1st, Terrestrial and Aqueous Rocks.\r\n  2d, Igneous Rocks.\r\n  3d, Crystalline Schists.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest areas of land are composed of rocks belonging to\r\nthe first class. These consist chiefly of the more or less indurated\r\nsediments of ancient rivers, lakes, and seas--namely, conglomerate,\r\nsandstone, shale, limestone, etc. And now and again, interstratified\r\nwith such aqueous beds, we meet with rocks of terrestrial origin, such\r\nas lignite, coal, and the débris of former glacial action. Now, most of\r\nour aqueous rocks have been accumulated in the sea, and thus we arrive\r\nat the conclusion that the present continental areas have from time to\r\ntime been largely submerged--that the sea has frequently covered what\r\nare now the dry lands of the globe. But one remarkable fact stands out,\r\nand it is this: Nowhere amongst the sedimentary rocks of the earth's\r\ncrust do we meet with any ancient sediments which can be likened to\r\nthe red clay now slowly accumulating in the deeper abysses of the\r\nocean. There are no rocks of abysmal origin. Many of our limestones\r\nhave undoubtedly formed in deep, clear water, but none of these is\r\nabysmal. Portions of Europe may now and again have been submerged for\r\nseveral thousand feet, but no part of this or any other continent,\r\nso far as we yet know, has within geological time been depressed to\r\ndepths comparable to those of the present oceanic basins. Nay, by\r\nfar the larger portions of our marine formations have accumulated in\r\ncomparatively shallow water--sandstones and shales (sand and mud) being\r\nby far the most common kinds of rock that we encounter. In short,\r\naqueous strata have, as a rule, been deposited at no great depth and\r\nat no great distance from dry land; the rocks are built up mostly of\r\nterrigenous material; and even the purer limestones and chalks, which\r\nwe may suppose accumulated in seas of moderate depth, not infrequently\r\ncontain some terrestrial relic which has been drifted out to sea, and\r\nafford other evidence to show that the nearest land was never very far\r\naway. Followed along their outcrop such rocks sooner or later become\r\nmixed and interbedded with ordinary sedimentary matter. Thus, for\r\nexample, the thick carboniferous limestone of Wales and the Midlands of\r\nEngland must have accumulated in the clear water of a moderately deep\r\nsea. But when this limestone is traced north into Northumberland it\r\nbegins to receive intercalations of sandstone and shale, which become\r\nmore and more important, until in Scotland they form by much the larger\r\nportion of the series--the enormous thick limestones of the south being\r\nrepresented by only a few inconsiderable beds, included, along with\r\nseams of ironstone and coal, in a thick succession of sandstones and\r\nshales.\r\n\r\nOf the igneous rocks and the crystalline schists I need not speak at\r\npresent, but I shall have something to say about them before I have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHaving learned that no truly abysmal rocks enter into the composition\r\nof our continents, of what kind of rocks, we may ask, are the islands\r\ncomposed? Well, some of those islands are built up of precisely the\r\nsame materials as we find in the continents. This is the case with most\r\nislands which are not separated from continental areas by profoundly\r\ndeep seas. Thus our own islands with their numerous satellites are\r\ngeologically one with the adjacent continent. Their present separation\r\nis a mere accident. Were the European area, with the adjacent sea-bed,\r\nto be elevated for a few hundred feet we should find that Britain and\r\nIreland form geologically part and parcel of the continent. And the\r\nsame is the case with Nova Zembla and Spitzbergen in the north, and\r\nwith the Mediterranean islands in the south. There is another large\r\nclass of islands, however, which are characterised by the total absence\r\nof any of those sedimentary rocks of which, as I have just said, our\r\ncontinents and continental islands are chiefly built up. The islands\r\nreferred to are scattered over the bosom of the great ocean, and are\r\nsurrounded by profoundly deep water. Some are apparently composed\r\nentirely of coral, others are of volcanic origin, and yet others are\r\nformed partly of volcanic rock and partly of coral. Thus we have two\r\ndistinct kinds of island:--\r\n\r\n  1st, Islands which have at one time evidently been connected with\r\n         adjacent continents, and which are therefore termed\r\n         _continental islands_; and\r\n\r\n  2d, _Oceanic islands_, which rise, as it were, from profound depths\r\n        in the sea, and which have never formed part of the continents.\r\n\r\nThe fauna and flora of the former class agree with those of the\r\nneighbouring continents, although some modifications are met with,\r\nespecially when the insulation has been of long standing. When such has\r\nbeen the case the species of plants and animals may be almost entirely\r\ndistinct. Nevertheless, such ancient continental islands agree with\r\nthose which have been separated in more recent geological times in\r\ncontaining both indigenous amphibians and mammals. Oceanic islands,\r\non the other hand, contain no indigenous mammals or amphibians,\r\ntheir life consisting chiefly of insects and birds, and usually some\r\nreptiles--just such a fauna as might have been introduced by the\r\ninfluence of winds and of oceanic currents carrying driftwood.\r\n\r\nSuch facts, as have now been briefly summarised, point clearly to\r\nthe conclusion that the oceanic basins and continental areas are of\r\nprimeval antiquity. All the geological facts go to prove that abysmal\r\nwaters have never prevailed over the regions now occupied by dry land;\r\nnor is there any evidence to show that continental land-masses ever\r\nexisted in what are now the deepest portions of the ocean. The islets\r\ndotted over the surface of the Pacific and the other great seas are\r\nnot the relics of a vast submerged continent. They are either the tops\r\nof submarine volcanic mountains, or they are coral structures founded\r\nupon the shoulders of degraded volcanoes and mountain-chains, and\r\nbuilt up to the surface by the indefatigable labours of the humble\r\npolyp. We come then to the general conclusion that oceanic basins and\r\nintervening continental ridges are great primeval wrinkles in the\r\nearth's crust--that they are due to the sinking down of that crust\r\nupon the cooling and contracting nucleus. These vast wrinkles had come\r\ninto existence long before the formation of our oldest geological\r\nstrata. All our rocks may, in short, be looked upon as forming a mere\r\nsuperficial skin covering and concealing the crystalline materials\r\nwhich no doubt formed the original surface of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nHaving premised so much, let me now turn to consider the geological\r\nhistory of our own Continent, and endeavour to trace out the various\r\nstages in its evolution. Of course I can only do so in a very brief\r\nand general manner; it is impossible to go into details. We shall\r\nfind, however, that the history of the evolution of Europe, even\r\nwhen sketched in outline, is one full of instruction for students\r\nof physical geography, and that it amply bears out the view of the\r\npermanency of the greater features of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThe oldest rocks that we know of are the crystalline schists and\r\ngneiss, belonging to what is called the Archæan system. The origin\r\nof these rocks is still a matter of controversy--some holding them\r\nto be part of the primeval crust of the globe, or the chemical\r\nprecipitates of a primeval ocean, others maintaining that they are\r\naltered or metamorphosed rocks of diverse origin, a large proportion\r\nhaving consisted originally of aqueous or sedimentary rocks, such\r\nas sandstone and shale; while not a few are supposed to have been\r\noriginally eruptive igneous rocks. According to some geologists,\r\ntherefore, the Archæan rocks represent the earliest sediments\r\ndeposited over the continental ridges. It is supposed that here and\r\nthere those ridges rose above the surface of what may have been a\r\nboiling or highly-heated ocean, from whose waters copious chemical\r\nprecipitations took place, while gravel and shingle gathered around\r\nthe shores of the primeval lands. According to other writers, however,\r\nthe Archæan rocks were probably accumulated under normal conditions.\r\nThey consist, it is contended, partly of sediment washed down from\r\nsome ancient land-surface, and distributed over the floor of an old\r\nsea (just as sediments are being transported and deposited in our own\r\nday), and partly of ancient igneous rocks. Their present character is\r\nattributed to subsequent changes, superinduced by heat and pressure,\r\nat a time when the masses in question were deeply buried under later\r\nformations, which have since been washed away. In a word, we are\r\nstill quite uncertain as to the true origin of the Archæan rocks. Not\r\ninfrequently they show a bedded structure, and in that respect they\r\nsimulate the appearance of strata of sedimentary origin. It is very\r\ndoubtful, however, whether this \"bedded structure\" is any evidence of\r\nan original aqueous arrangement. We know now that an appearance of\r\nbedding has been induced in originally amorphous rocks during great\r\nearth-movements. Granite masses, for example, have been so crushed\r\nand squeezed as to assume a bedded aspect, and a similar structure\r\nhas been developed in many other kinds of rock subjected to enormous\r\npressure. Whatever may have been the origin of the bedded structure\r\nof the Archæan rocks, it is certain that the masses have been tilted\r\nup and convoluted in the most remarkable manner. Hitherto they have\r\nyielded no unequivocal trace of organic remains--the famous _Eozoon_\r\nbeing now generally considered as of purely mineral origin. The\r\nphysical conditions under which the Archæan gneiss and schist came into\r\nexistence are thus quite undetermined, but geologists are agreed that\r\nthe earliest land-surfaces, of the former existence of which we can\r\nbe quite certain, were composed of rocks. And this brings us to the\r\nbeginning of reliable geological history.\r\n\r\nAll subsequent geological time--that, namely, of which we have any\r\nrecord preserved in the fossiliferous strata--is divided into four\r\ngreat eras, namely the Palæozoic, the Mesozoic, the Cainozoic, and\r\nthe Post-Tertiary eras, each of which embraces various periods, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Post-Tertiary {Recent.\r\n                {Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n                {Pliocene.\r\n  Tertiary or   {Miocene.\r\n  Cainozoic     {Oligocene.\r\n                {Eocene.\r\n\r\n                {Cretaceous.\r\n  Secondary or  {Jurassic.\r\n  Mesozoic      {Triassic.\r\n\r\n                {Permian.\r\n                {Carboniferous.\r\n  Primary or    {Devonian and Old Red Sandstone.\r\n  Palæozoic     {Silurian.\r\n                {Cambrian.\r\n\r\n  Archæan,         Fundamental Gneiss.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Archæan, we find that the next oldest strata are those\r\nwhich were accumulated during the Cambrian period, to which succeeded\r\nthe Silurian, the Devonian and Old Red Sandstone, the Carboniferous,\r\nand the Permian periods--all represented by great thicknesses of\r\nstrata, which overspread wide regions.\r\n\r\nNow, at the beginning of the Cambrian period, we have evidence to show\r\nthat the primeval continental ridge was still largely under water,\r\nthe dry land being massed chiefly in the north. At that distant date\r\na broad land-surface extended from the Outer Hebrides north-eastwards\r\nthrough Scandinavia, Finland, and northern Russia. How much further\r\nnorth and north-west of the present limits of Europe that ancient\r\nland may have extended we cannot tell, but it probably occupied wide\r\nregions which are now submerged in the shallow waters of the Arctic\r\nOcean. In the north of Scotland a large inland sea or lake existed in\r\nCambrian times,[DG] and there is some evidence to suggest that similar\r\nlacustrine conditions may have obtained in the Welsh area at the\r\nbeginning of the period. South of the northern land lay a shallow sea\r\ncovering all middle and southern Europe. That sea, however, was dotted\r\nhere and there with a few islands of Archæan rocks, occupying the site\r\nof what are now some of the hills of middle Germany, such as the Riesen\r\nGebirge, the Erz Gebirge, the Fichtel Gebirge, etc., and possibly some\r\nof the Archæan districts of France and the Iberian peninsula.\r\n\r\n[DG] The Red Sandstones of the north-west Highlands are now believed to\r\nbe of pre-Cambrian age.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding period was one of eminently marine conditions, the wide\r\ndistribution of Silurian strata showing that during the accumulation\r\nof these, enormous tracts of our Continent were overflowed by the sea.\r\nNone of these deposits, however, is of truly oceanic origin. They\r\nappear for the most part to have been laid down in shallow seas, which\r\nhere and there may have been moderately deep. During the formation of\r\nthe Lower Silurian the whole of the British area, with the exception\r\nperhaps of some of the Archæan tracts of the north-west, seems to have\r\nbeen under water. The submergence had commenced in Cambrian times, and\r\nwas continued up to the close of the Lower Silurian period. During\r\nthis long-continued period of submergence volcanic activity manifested\r\nitself at various points--our country being represented at that time\r\nby groups of volcanic islands, scattered over the site of what is now\r\nWales, and extending westward into the Irish region, and northwards\r\ninto the districts of Cumberland and south Ayrshire. Towards the close\r\nof the Lower Silurian period considerable earth-movements took place,\r\nwhich had the effect of increasing the amount of dry land, the most\r\ncontinuous mass or masses of which still occupied the northern and\r\nnorth-western part of our Continent. In the beginning of Upper Silurian\r\ntimes a broad sea covered the major portion of middle and probably all\r\nsouthern Europe. Numerous islands, however, would seem to have existed\r\nin such regions as Wales, and the various tracts of older Palæozoic\r\nand Archæan rocks of middle Germany. Many of these islands, however,\r\nwere partially and some entirely submerged before the close of Silurian\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe next great period--that, namely, which witnessed the accumulation\r\nof the Devonian and Old Red Sandstone strata--was in some respects\r\nstrongly contrasted to the preceding period. The Silurian rocks, as I\r\nhave said, are eminently marine. The Old Red Sandstones, on the other\r\nhand, appear to have been accumulated chiefly in great lakes or inland\r\nseas, and they betoken therefore the former existence of extensive\r\nlands, while the contemporaneous Devonian strata are of marine origin.\r\nTowards the close of the Upper Silurian period, then, we know that\r\nconsiderable upheavals ensued in western and north-western Europe,\r\nand wide stretches of the Silurian sea-bottom were converted into dry\r\nland. The geographical distribution of the Devonian in Europe, and\r\nthe relation of that system to the Silurian, show that the Devonian\r\nsea did not cover so broad an expanse as that of the Upper Silurian.\r\nThe sea had shallowed, and the area of dry land had increased when\r\nthe Devonian strata began to accumulate. In trying to realise the\r\nconditions that obtained during the formation of the Devonian and the\r\nOld Red Sandstone, we may picture to ourselves a time when the Atlantic\r\nOcean extended eastwards over the south of England and the north-east\r\nof France, and occupied the major portion of central Europe, sweeping\r\nnorth-east into Russia, and how much further we cannot tell. North\r\nof that sea stretched a wide land-surface, in the hollows of which\r\nlay great lakes or inland seas, which seem now and again to have had\r\ncommunication with the open ocean. It was in these lakes that the Old\r\nRed Sandstone was accumulated, while the Devonian or marine rocks were\r\nformed in the wide waters lying to the south. Submarine volcanoes were\r\nactive at that time in Germany; and similarly in Scotland numerous\r\nvolcanoes existed, such as those of the Sidlaw Hills and the Cheviots.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous system contains the record of a long and complex\r\nseries of geographical changes, but the chief points of importance\r\nin the present rapid review may be very briefly summed up. In the\r\nearlier part of the period marine conditions prevailed. Thus we find\r\nevidence to show that the sea extended further north than it did\r\nduring the preceding Devonian period. During the formation of the\r\nmountain-limestone, a deep sea covered the major portion of Ireland and\r\nEngland, but shallowed off as it entered the Scottish area. A few rocky\r\nislets were all that represented Ireland and England at that time.\r\nPassing eastwards, the Carboniferous sea appears to have covered the\r\nlow-grounds of middle Europe and enormous tracts in Russia. The deepest\r\npart of the sea lay over the Anglo-Hibernian and Franco-Belgian areas;\r\ntowards the east it became shallower. Probably the same sea swept over\r\nall southern Europe, but many islands may have diversified its surface,\r\nas in Brittany and central France, in Spain and Portugal, and in the\r\nvarious areas of older Palæozoic and Archæan rocks in central and\r\nsouth-west Europe. In the latter stages of the Carboniferous period,\r\nthe limits of the sea were much circumscribed, and wide continental\r\nconditions supervened. Enormous marshes, jungles, and forests now\r\noverspread the newly-formed lands. Another feature of the Carboniferous\r\nwas the great number of volcanoes--submarine and sub-aërial--which were\r\nparticularly abundant in Scotland, especially during the earlier stages\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Permian period seem to have been deposited chiefly in\r\nclosed basins. When, owing to the movement of elevation or upheaval\r\nwhich took place in late Carboniferous times, the carboniferous\r\nlimestone sea had been drained away from extensive areas in central\r\nEurope, wide stretches of sea still covered certain considerable\r\ntracts. These, however, as time went on, were cut off from the main\r\nocean and converted into great salt lakes. Such inland seas overspread\r\nmuch of the low-lying tracts of Britain and middle Germany, and they\r\nalso extended over a broad space in the north-east of Russia. It was in\r\nthese seas that the Permian strata were accumulated. The period, it may\r\nbe added, was marked by the appearance of volcanic action in Scotland\r\nand Germany.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, as our present knowledge goes, that part of the European\r\ncontinent which was the earliest to be evolved lay towards the\r\nnorth-west and north. All through the Palæozoic era a land-surface\r\nwould seem to have endured in that direction--a land-surface from the\r\ndenudation or wearing down of which the marine sedimentary formations\r\nof the bordering regions were derived. But when we reflect on the great\r\nthickness and horizontal extent of those sediments, we can hardly\r\ndoubt that the primeval land must have had a much wider range towards\r\nthe north and north-west than is the case with modern Europe. The\r\nlands, from which the older Palæozoic marine sediments of the British\r\nIslands and Scandinavia were obtained, must, for the most part, be\r\nnow submerged. In later Palæozoic times land began to extend in the\r\nSpanish peninsula, northern France, and middle Europe, the denudation\r\nof which doubtless furnished materials for the elaboration of the\r\ncontemporaneous strata of those regions. Southern Europe is so largely\r\ncomposed of Mesozoic and Cainozoic rocks that we can say very little as\r\nto the condition of that area in Palæozoic times, but the probabilities\r\nare that it continued for the most part under marine conditions.\r\nIn few words, then, we may conclude that while after Archæan times\r\ndry land prevailed in the north and north-west, marine conditions\r\npredominated further south. Ever and anon, however, the sea vanished\r\nfrom wide regions in central Europe, and was replaced by terrestrial\r\nand lacustrine conditions. Further, as none of the Palæozoic marine\r\nstrata indicates a deep ocean, but all consist for the most part of\r\naccumulations formed at moderate depths, it follows that there must\r\nhave been a general subsidence of our area to allow of their successive\r\ndeposition--a subsidence, however, which was frequently interrupted by\r\nlong pauses, and sometimes by movements in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe first period of the Mesozoic era, namely, the Triassic, was\r\ncharacterised by much the same kind of conditions as obtained towards\r\nthe close of Palæozoic times. A large inland sea then covered a\r\nconsiderable portion of England, and seems to have extended north into\r\nthe south of Scotland, and across the area of the Irish Sea into the\r\nnorth-east of Ireland. Another inland sea extended westward from the\r\nThüringer-Wald across the Vosges into France, and stretched northwards\r\nfrom the confines of Switzerland over what are now the low-grounds of\r\nHolland and northern Germany. In this ancient sea the Harz Mountains\r\nformed a rocky island. While terrestrial and lacustrine conditions\r\nthus obtained in central and northern Europe, an open sea existed in\r\nthe more southerly regions of the continent. Towards the close of the\r\nperiod submergence ensued in the English and German areas, and the salt\r\nlakes became connected with the open sea.\r\n\r\nDuring the Jurassic period the regions now occupied in Britain and\r\nIreland by the older rocks appear to have been chiefly dry land.\r\nScotland and Ireland, for the most part, stood above the sea-level,\r\nwhile nearly all England was under water--the hills of Cumberland\r\nand Westmoreland, the Pennine chain, Wales, the heights of Devon and\r\nCornwall, and a ridge of Palæozoic rocks which underlies London, being\r\nthe chief lands in south Britain. The same sea overflowed an extensive\r\nportion of what is now the Continent. The older rocks in the north-west\r\nand north-east of France, and the central plateau of the same country,\r\nformed dry land; all the rest of that country was submerged. In like\r\nmanner the sea covered much of eastern Spain. In middle Europe it\r\noverflowed nearly all the low-grounds of north Germany, and extended\r\nfar east into the heart of Russia. It occupied the site of the Jura\r\nMountains, and passed eastward into Bohemia, while on the south side of\r\nthe Alps it spread over a large part of Italy, extending eastward so as\r\nto submerge a broad area in Austria-Hungary and the Turkish provinces.\r\nThus the northern latitudes of Europe continued to be the site of the\r\nchief land-masses, what are now the central and southern portions of\r\nthe Continent being a great archipelago with numerous islands, large\r\nand small.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic rocks, attaining as they do a thickness of several\r\nthousand feet, point to very considerable subsidence. The movement,\r\nhowever, was not continuous, but ever and anon was interrupted by\r\npauses. Taken as a whole, the strata appear to have accumulated in a\r\ncomparatively shallow sea, which, however, was sufficiently deep in\r\nplaces to allow of the growth, in clear water, of coral-reefs.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the Jurassic period a movement of elevation\r\nensued, which caused the sea to retreat from wide areas, and thus when\r\nthe Cretaceous period began the British region was chiefly dry land.\r\nMiddle Europe would seem also to have participated in this upward\r\nmovement. Eventually, however, subsidence again ensued. Most of what\r\nare now the low-grounds of Britain were submerged, the sea stretching\r\neastwards over a vast region in middle Europe, as far as the slopes\r\nof the Urals. The deepest part of this sea, however, was in the west,\r\nand lay over England and northern France. Further east, in what are\r\nnow Saxony and Bohemia, the waters were shallow, and gradually became\r\nsilted up. In the Mediterranean basin a wide open sea existed, covering\r\nlarge sections of eastern Spain and southern France, overflowing the\r\nsite of the Jura Mountains, drowning most of the Alpine Lands, the\r\nItalian peninsula, the eastern borders of the Adriatic, and Greece.\r\nIn short, there are good grounds for believing that the Cretaceous\r\nMediterranean was not only much broader than the present sea, but\r\nthat it extended into Asia, overwhelming vast regions there, and\r\ncommunicated with the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nSumming up what we know of the principal geographical changes that\r\ntook place during the Mesozoic era, we are impressed with the fact\r\nthat, all through those changes, a wide land-surface persisted in the\r\nnorth and north-west of the European area, just as was the case in\r\nPalæozoic times. The highest grounds were the Urals and the uplands\r\nof Scandinavia and Britain. In middle Europe the Pyrenees and the\r\nAlps were as yet inconsiderable heights, the loftiest lands being\r\nthose of the Harz, the Riesen Gebirge, and other regions of Palæozoic\r\nand Archæan rocks. The lower parts of England and the great plains of\r\ncentral Europe were sometimes submerged in the waters of a more or\r\nless continuous sea; but ever and anon elevation ensued, and the sea\r\nwas divided, as it were, into a series of great lakes. In the south of\r\nEurope a Mediterranean Sea would appear to have endured all through the\r\nMesozoic era--a Mediterranean of considerably greater extent, however,\r\nthan the present. Thus we see the main features of our Continent were\r\nalready clearly outlined before the close of the Cretaceous period. The\r\ncontinental area then, as now, consisted of a wide belt of high-ground\r\nin the north, extending roughly from south-west to north-east; south of\r\nthis a vast stretch of low-grounds, sweeping from west to east up to\r\nthe foot of the Urals, and bounded on the south by an irregular zone of\r\nelevated land having approximately the same trend; still further south,\r\nthe maritime tracts of the Mediterranean basin. During periods of\r\ndepression the low-grounds of central Europe were invaded by the sea,\r\nand the Mediterranean at the same time extended north over many regions\r\nwhich are now dry land. It is in these two low-lying tracts, therefore,\r\nand the country immediately adjoining them, that the Mesozoic strata of\r\nEurope are chiefly developed.\r\n\r\nA general movement of upheaval[DH] supervened at the close of the\r\nCretaceous period, and the sea which, during that period, overflowed\r\nso much of middle Europe had largely disappeared before the beginning\r\nof Eocene times. The southern portions of the continent, however, were\r\nstill mostly under water, while great bays and arms of the sea extended\r\nnorthwards now and again into central Europe. On to the close of the\r\nMiocene period, indeed, southern and south-eastern Europe consisted\r\nof a series of irregular straggling islands and peninsulas washed\r\nby the waters of a genial sea. Towards the close of early Cainozoic\r\ntimes, the Alps, which had hitherto been of small importance, were\r\ngreatly upheaved, as were also the Pyrenees and the Carpathians. The\r\nfloor of the Eocene sea in the Alpine region was ridged up for many\r\nthousands of feet, its deposits being folded, twisted, inverted, and\r\nmetamorphosed. Another great elevation of the same area was effected\r\nafter the Miocene period, the accumulations of that period now forming\r\nconsiderable mountains along the northern flanks of the Alpine\r\nchain. Notwithstanding these gigantic elevations in south-central\r\nEurope--perhaps in consequence of them--the low-lying tracts of what\r\nis now southern Europe continued to be largely submerged, and even the\r\nmiddle regions of the continent were now and again occupied by broad\r\nlakes which sometimes communicated with the sea. In Miocene times, for\r\nexample, an arm of the Mediterranean extended up the Rhone valley, and\r\nstretched across the north of Switzerland to the basin of the Danube.\r\nAfter the elevation of the Miocene strata these inland stretches of\r\nsea disappeared, but the Mediterranean still overflowed wider areas in\r\nsouthern Europe than it does in our day. Eventually, however, in late\r\nPliocene times, the bed of that sea experienced considerable elevation,\r\nnewer Pliocene strata occurring in Sicily up to a height of 3000 feet\r\nat least. It was probably at or about that period that the Black Sea\r\nand the Sea of Asov retreated from the wide low-grounds of southern\r\nRussia, and that the inland seas and lakes of Austria-Hungary finally\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n[DH] I now doubt whether any vertical upheaval of a wide continental\r\narea is possible. The so-called \"continental uplifts\" are probably in\r\nmost cases rather negative than positive elevations. In other words,\r\nthe land seems to rise simply because the sea retreats owing perhaps to\r\nthe sinking of the crust within the great oceanic basins. See on this\r\nsubject, Article XIII.\r\n\r\nThe Cainozoic era is distinguished in Europe for its volcanic\r\nphenomena. The grandest eruptions were those of Oligocene times. To\r\nthat date belong the basalts of Antrim, Mull, Skye, the Faröe Islands,\r\nand the older series of volcanic rocks in Iceland. These basalts speak\r\nto us of prodigious fissure eruptions, when molten rock welled up along\r\nthe lines of great cracks in the earth's crust, flooding wide regions,\r\nand building up enormous plateaux, of which we now behold the merest\r\nfragments. The ancient volcanoes of central France, those of the Eifel\r\ncountry and many other places in Germany, and the volcanic rocks of\r\nHungary, are all of Cainozoic age; while, in the south of Europe, Etna,\r\nVesuvius, and other Italian volcanoes date their origin to the later\r\nstages of the same great era.\r\n\r\nThus before the beginning of Pleistocene times all the main features\r\nof Europe had come into existence. Since the close of the Pliocene\r\nperiod there have been many great revolutions of climate; several very\r\nconsiderable oscillations of the sea-level have taken place, and the\r\nland has been subjected to powerful and long-continued erosion. But\r\nthe greater contours of the surface which began to appear in Palæozoic\r\ntimes, and which in Mesozoic times were more strongly pronounced,\r\nhad been fully evolved by the close of the Pliocene period. The most\r\nremarkable geographical changes which have taken place since then have\r\nbeen successive elevations and depressions, in consequence of which the\r\narea of our Continent has been alternately increased and diminished. At\r\na time well within the human period our own islands have been united to\r\nthemselves and the Continent, and the dry land has extended north-west\r\nand north, so as to include Spitzbergen, the Faröe Islands, and perhaps\r\nIceland. On the other hand, our islands have been within a recent\r\nperiod largely submerged.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion, then, to which we are led by a review of the\r\ngreater geographical changes through which the European continent\r\nhas passed is simply this--that the substructure upon which all our\r\nsedimentary strata repose is of primeval antiquity. Our dry lands are\r\nbuilt up of rocks which have been accumulated over the surface of a\r\ngreat wrinkle of the earth's crust. There have been endless movements\r\nof elevation and depression, causing minor deformations, as it were,\r\nof that wrinkle, and inducing constant changes in the distribution\r\nof land and water; but no part of the continental ridge has ever\r\nbeen depressed to an abysmal depth. The ridge has endured through\r\nall geological time. We can see also that the land has been evolved\r\naccording to a definite plan. Certain marked features begin to appear\r\nvery early in Palæozoic times, and become more and more pronounced\r\nas the ages roll on. All the countless oscillations of level, all\r\nthe myriad changes in the distribution of land and water, all the\r\nearthquake disturbances and volcanic eruptions--in a word, all the\r\ncomplex mutations to which the geological record bears witness--have\r\nhad for their end the completion of one grand design.\r\n\r\nA study of the geological structure of Europe--an examination of\r\nthe manner in which the highly folded and disturbed strata are\r\ndeveloped--throws no small light upon the origin of the larger or\r\ndominant features of our Continent. The most highly convoluted rocks\r\nare those of Archæan and Palæozoic age, and these are developed chiefly\r\nin the north-western and western parts of the Continent. Highly\r\ncontorted strata likewise appear in all the mountain-chains of central\r\nEurope--some of the rocks being of Palæozoic, while others are of\r\nMesozoic and of Cainozoic age. Leaving these mountains for the moment\r\nout of account, we find that it is along the western and north-western\r\nsea-board where we encounter the widest regions of highly-disturbed\r\nrocks. The Highlands of Scandinavia and Britain are composed, for\r\nthe most part, of highly-flexed and convoluted rocks, which speak to\r\ntitanic movements of the crust; and similar much-crushed and tilted\r\nrock-masses occur in north-west France, in Portugal, and in western\r\nSpain. But when we follow the highly-folded Palæozoic strata of\r\nScandinavia into the low-grounds of the great plains, they gradually\r\nflatten out, until in Russia they occur in undisturbed horizontal\r\npositions. Over thousands of square miles in that country the Palæozoic\r\nrocks are just as little altered and disturbed as strata pertaining to\r\nMesozoic and Cainozoic times.\r\n\r\nThese facts can have but one meaning. Could we smooth out all the\r\npuckerings, creases, foldings, and flexures which characterise the\r\nArchæan and Palæozoic rocks of western and north-western Europe, it\r\nis certain that these strata would stretch for many miles out into\r\nthe Atlantic. Obviously they have been compressed and crumpled up by\r\nsome force acting upon them from the west. Now, if it be true that the\r\nbasin of the Atlantic is of primeval origin, then it is obvious that\r\nthe sinking down of the crust within that area would exert enormous\r\npressure upon the borders of our continental area. As cooling and\r\ncontracting of the nucleus continued, subsidence would go on under the\r\noceanic basin, depression taking place either slowly and gradually,\r\nduring protracted periods, or now and again more or less suddenly. But\r\nwhether gradually or suddenly effected, the result of the subsidence\r\nwould be the same upon the borders of our Continent; the strata along\r\nthe whole western and north-western margins of the European ridge would\r\nnecessarily be flexed and disturbed. Away to the east, however, the\r\nstrata, not being subject to the like pressure, would be left in their\r\noriginal horizontal positions.\r\n\r\nNow it can be shown that the mountains of Scandinavia and the British\r\nIslands are much older than the Alps, the Pyrenees, and many other\r\nconspicuous ranges in central and southern Europe. Our mountains and\r\nthose of Scandinavia are the mere wrecks of their former selves.\r\nOriginally they may have rivaled--they probably exceeded--the Alps\r\nin height and extent. It is most likely, indeed, that the areas\r\nof Palæozoic rocks in France, Portugal, and Spain also attained\r\nmountainous elevations. But the principal upheaval of the western\r\nmargins of our Continent was practically completed before the close of\r\nthe Palæozoic period, and since that time those elevated regions have\r\nbeen subjected to prodigious erosion, the later formations being in\r\nlarge measure composed of their débris. I do not, of course, wish it\r\nto be understood that there has been no upheaval affecting the west\r\nof Europe since Palæozoic times. The tilted position of many of our\r\nMesozoic strata clearly proves the contrary. But undoubtedly the main\r\ndisturbances which produced the folding, fracturing, and contortion\r\nof the Palæozoic strata of western Europe took place before the close\r\nof the Palæozoic period. The mountains of Britain and Scandinavia are\r\namongst the oldest in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to inquire into the origin of the mountains of central\r\nEurope we have little difficulty in detecting the chief factors\r\nin their formation. An examination of the Pyrenees, the Alps, and\r\nother hill-ranges having the same general trend shows us that they\r\nconsist of flexed and convoluted rocks. They are, in short, mountains\r\nof elevation, ridged up by tangential thrusts. Of this we need not\r\nhave the slightest doubt. If, for example, we approach the Alps from\r\nthe low-grounds of France, we observe the strata as we come towards\r\nthe Jura beginning to undulate--the undulations becoming more and\r\nmore marked, and passing into sharp folds and plications, until, in\r\nthe Alps, the beds become twisted, convoluted, and bent back upon\r\nthemselves in the wildest confusion. Now, speaking in general terms, we\r\nmay say that similar facts confront us in connection with every true\r\nmountain-range in central Europe. Let it be noted, further, that all\r\nthose ranges have the same trend, which we may take to be approximately\r\neast and west, or nearly at right angles to the trend of the Palæozoic\r\nhigh-grounds of western and north-western Europe. Looked at broadly,\r\nour continental ridge may be said to be traversed from west to east\r\nby two wide depressions or troughs, separated by the intervening\r\nbelt of higher grounds just referred to. The former of these troughs\r\ncorresponds to the great central plain, which passes through the south\r\nof England, north-east France, the Low Countries, and Denmark, whence\r\nit sweeps east through Germany, and expands into the wide low-grounds\r\nof Russia. The southern trough or depression embraces the maritime\r\ntracts of the Mediterranean and the regions which that sea covers.\r\nSuch, then, are the dominant features of our Continent, to which all\r\nothers are of subordinate importance. Now it cannot be doubted that\r\nthe two great troughs are belts of subsidence in the continental ridge\r\nitself. And their existence explains the origin of the mountain-ranges\r\nwhich separate them. We know that the northern trough is of extreme\r\nantiquity; it is older, at all events, than the Silurian period. Even\r\nat that distant date its southern limits were marked out by ridges\r\nof Archæan rocks, which seem to have formed islands in what is now\r\nmiddle Germany, and probably also in Switzerland and central France.\r\nThe appearance of those Archæan rocks in central Europe was doubtless\r\ndue to a ridging up of the crust induced by those parallel movements\r\nof subsidence which produced the northern and southern troughs. The\r\nnorthern trough was probably always the shallower depression of the\r\ntwo, for we have evidence to show that, again and again in Mesozoic and\r\nlater times, the seas which overflowed what are now the central plains\r\nof Europe were of less considerable depth than that which occupied\r\nthe Mediterranean trough. As time rolled on, therefore, the northern\r\ntrough eventually became silted up; but so low even now is the level of\r\nthat trough that a relatively slight depression would cause the sea to\r\ninundate most extensive regions in middle Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Cainozoic times, as we have seen, the last great elevation of the\r\nAlps was effected--an elevation which can hardly have been due to any\r\nother cause than the more or less abrupt depression of the earth's\r\ncrust under the Mediterranean basin. The area of that sea is now much\r\nless considerable than it was in Tertiary times--a change due in part\r\nto silting up, but chiefly perhaps to the sinking down of its bed to\r\nprofounder depths.\r\n\r\nThus we may conclude that from a very early period--a period\r\nante-dating the formation of our oldest fossiliferous strata--the\r\nphysical structure of our Continent had already been planned. The\r\ndominant features of the primeval continental ridge are those\r\nwhich have endured through all geological time. They are the\r\nlines along which the beautiful lands in which we dwell have been\r\nconstructed. Tilted and convoluted, broken and crushed by myriad\r\nearth-movements--scarred, furrowed, worn and degraded by the frosts,\r\nthe rains, the rivers, and the seas of countless ages--the rocks of our\r\nContinent are yet eloquent of design. Where the ignorant sees nothing\r\nsave confusion and discord, the thoughtful student beholds everywhere\r\nthe evidence of a well-ordered evolution. Such is the conclusion to\r\nwhich we are led by all geological research.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n          SKETCH-MAPS ILLUSTRATING THE GEOGRAPHICAL EVOLUTION\r\n                        OF    CONTINENTAL AREAS\r\n\r\n           By PROFESSOR JAMES GEIKIE, LL.D., D.C.L., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PLATE V\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+------------------------------+\r\n  | MAP SHOWING THE             | MAP SHOWING THE              |\r\n  | AREA OF CONTINENTAL PLATEAU | AREA OF CONTINENTAL PLATEAU  |\r\n  | OCCUPIED BY SEA IN          | OCCUPIED BY SEA IN           |\r\n  | PALÆOZOIC TIMES.            | TERTIARY TIMES.              |\r\n  +-----------------------------+------------------------------+\r\n  | MAP SHOWING THE             | MAP SHOWING THE              |\r\n  | AREA OF CONTINENTAL PLATEAU | AREAS OF DOMINANT DEPRESSION |\r\n  | OCCUPIED BY SEA IN          | AND ELEVATION.               |\r\n  | MESOZOIC TIMES.             | (Below & Above the 1000      |\r\n  |                             |  fathom Contour Line)        |\r\n  +-----------------------------+------------------------------+\r\n\r\n  The Edinburgh Geographic Institute       J.

Although there is no\r\ngeneral agreement as to how former climatic fluctuations came about,\r\nyet the prevalent opinion is that in the past, just as in the present,\r\nthe character of the climate must have depended mainly on latitude\r\nand the relative position of the great land- and water-areas. This\r\nwas the doctrine taught by Lyell, and its cogency none will venture\r\nto dispute. It is true he postulated a total redistribution of oceans\r\nand continents--a view which the progress of science has shown to be\r\nuntenable. We can no longer speculate with him on the possibility of\r\nall the great land-areas having been grouped at one time round the\r\nequator, and at some other period about the poles. On the contrary, the\r\nevidence goes to show that the continents have never changed places\r\nwith the ocean--that the dominant features of the earth's crust are\r\nof primeval antiquity, and ante-date the oldest of the fossiliferous\r\nformations. The whole question of climatic changes, therefore, must\r\nbe reconsidered from the point of view of the modern doctrine of the\r\npermanency of continental and oceanic areas.\r\n\r\nBut before proceeding to this discussion, it may be well to glance\r\nfor a moment at the evidence from which it has been inferred that the\r\nclimate of the world has varied. Among the chief proofs of climatic\r\nfluctuations are the character and the distribution of former floras\r\nand faunas. It is true, fossils are, for the most part, relics of\r\nextinct forms, and we cannot assert of any one of these that its\r\nenvironment must have been the same as that of some analogous living\r\ntype. But, although we can base no argument on individual extinct\r\nforms, it does not follow that we are precluded from judging of\r\nthe conditions under which a whole suite of extinct organisms may\r\nhave lived. Doubtless, we can only reason from the analogy of the\r\npresent; but, when we take into account all the forms met with in some\r\nparticular geological system, we seem justified in drawing certain\r\nconclusions as to the conditions under which they flourished. Thus,\r\nshould we encounter in some great series of strata many reef-building\r\ncorals, associated with large cephalopods and the remains of tree-ferns\r\nand cycads, which last from their perfect state of preservation could\r\nnot have drifted far before they became buried in sediment, we should\r\nsurely be entitled to conclude that the strata in question had been\r\ndeposited in the waters of a genial sea, and that the neighbouring\r\nland likewise enjoyed a warm climate. Again should a certain system,\r\ncharacterised by the presence of some particular and well-marked flora\r\nand fauna, be encountered not only in sub-tropical and temperate\r\nlatitudes but also far within the Arctic Circle, we should infer that\r\nsuch a flora and fauna lived under climatic conditions of a very\r\ndifferent kind from any that now exist. The very presence, in the\r\nfar north, of fossils having such a geographical distribution would\r\nshow that the temperature of polar seas and lands could not have been\r\nless than temperate. When such broad methods of interpretation are\r\napplied to the problems suggested by former floras and faunas, we\r\nseem compelled to conclude that the conditions which determined the\r\ndistribution of life in bygone ages must have been, upon the whole,\r\nmore uniform and equable than they are now. It is unnecessary that I\r\nshould go into detailed proof; but I may refer, by way of illustration,\r\nto what is known of the Silurian and Carboniferous fossils of the\r\narctic regions. Most of these occur also in the temperate latitudes\r\nof Europe and North America, while many are recognised as distinctive\r\ntypes of the same strata nearly all the world over. As showing how\r\nstrongly the former broad distribution of life-forms is contrasted\r\nwith their present restricted range, Professor Heilprin has cited the\r\nBrachiopoda. Taking existing species and varieties as being 135 in\r\nnumber, he remarks that \"there is scarcely a single species which can\r\nbe said to be strictly cosmopolitan in its range, although not a few\r\nare very widely distributed; and, if we except boreal and hyperboreal\r\nforms, but a very limited number whose range embraces opposite sides\r\nof the same ocean. On the other hand, if we accept the data furnished\r\nby Richthofen concerning the Chinese Brachiopoda we find that out\r\nof a total of thirteen Silurian and twenty-four Devonian species,\r\nno less than ten of the former and sixteen of the latter recur in\r\nthe equivalent deposits of western Europe: and, further, that the\r\nDevonian species furnish eleven, or nearly 50 per cent. of the entire\r\nnumber, which are cosmopolitan or nearly so. Again, of the twenty-five\r\nCarboniferous species, North America holds fully fifteen, or 60 per\r\ncent., and a very nearly equal number are cosmopolitan.\" The same\r\npalæontologist reminds us that by far the greater number of fossils\r\nwhich occur in the Palæozoic strata of Australia are present also in\r\nregions lying well within the limits of the north temperate zone. \"In\r\nfact,\" he continues, \"the relationship between this southern fauna and\r\nthe faunas of Europe and North America is so great as to practically\r\namount to identity.\"\r\n\r\nBut, side by side with such evidence of broad distribution, we are\r\nconfronted with facts which go to show that, even at the dawn of\r\nPalæozoic times, the oceanic areas at all events had their more or less\r\ndistinct life-provinces. While many of the old forms were cosmopolitan,\r\nothers were apparently restricted in their range. It would be strange,\r\nindeed, had it been otherwise; for, however uniform the climatic\r\nconditions may have been, still that uniformity was only comparative.\r\nAn absolutely uniform world-climate is well-nigh inconceivable. All we\r\ncan maintain is that the conditions during certain prolonged periods\r\nwere so equable as to allow of the general diffusion of species over\r\nvastly greater areas than now; and that such conditions extended\r\nfrom low latitudes up to polar regions. Now, among the chief factors\r\nwhich in our day determine the limitation of faunas and floras, we\r\nmust reckon latitude and the geographical position of land and water.\r\nWhat, then, it may be asked, were the causes which allowed of the much\r\nbroader distribution of species in former ages?\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that before a completely satisfactory answer to that\r\nquestion can be given, our knowledge of past geographical conditions\r\nmust be considerably increased. If we could prepare approximately\r\ncorrect maps and charts to indicate the position of land and sea\r\nduring the formation of the several fossiliferous systems, we should\r\nbe able to reason with some confidence on the subject of climate.\r\nBut, unfortunately, the preparation of such correct maps and charts\r\nis impossible. The data for compilations of the kind required are\r\nstill inadequate, and it may well be doubted whether, in the case of\r\nthe older systems, we shall ever be able to arrive at any detailed\r\nknowledge of their geographical conditions. Nevertheless, the\r\ngeological structure of the earth's crust has been so far unravelled as\r\nto allow us to form certain general conceptions of the conditions that\r\nmust have attended the evolution of our continents. And it is with such\r\ngeneral conceptions only that I have at present to deal.\r\n\r\nI said a little ago that the question of geological climates must now\r\nbe considered from the point of view of the permanency of the great\r\ndominant features of the earth's crust. I need not recapitulate the\r\nevidence upon which Dana and his followers have based this doctrine\r\nof the primeval antiquity of our continental and oceanic areas. It is\r\nenough if I remind you that by continental areas we simply mean certain\r\nextensive regions in which elevation has, upon the whole, been in\r\nexcess of depression; by oceanic area, on the other hand, is meant that\r\nvast region throughout which depression has exceeded elevation. Thus,\r\nwhile the area of permanent or preponderating depression has, from\r\nearliest geological times, been occupied by the ocean, the continental\r\nareas have been again and again invaded by the sea--and even now\r\nextensive portions are under water. It is not only the continental dry\r\nland, therefore, but all the bordering belt of sea-floor which does not\r\nexceed 1000 fathoms or so in depth, that must be included in the region\r\nof dominant elevation. Were the whole of this region to be raised above\r\nthe level of the sea, the present continents would become connected so\r\nas to form one vast land-mass, or continental plateau. (D, Plate IV.)\r\n\r\nAll the sedimentary strata with which we are acquainted have been\r\naccumulated over the surface of that great plateau, and consequently\r\nare of comparatively shallow-water origin. They show us, in fact, that\r\nat no time in geological history has that plateau ever been drowned in\r\ndepths at all comparable to those of the deeper portions of our oceanic\r\ntroughs. The stratified rocks teach us, moreover, that the present\r\nland-areas have been gradually evolved, and that, notwithstanding\r\nmany oscillations of level, these areas have continued to increase\r\nin extent--so that there is probably more land-surface now than at\r\nany previous era in the history of our globe. To give even a meagre\r\noutline of the evidence bearing upon this interesting subject is here\r\nimpossible. All that I can do is to indicate very briefly some of the\r\ngeneral results to which that evidence seems to lead.\r\n\r\nThe oldest rocks with which we are acquainted are the so-called Archæan\r\nschists[DJ] But these have hitherto yielded no unequivocal traces\r\nof organic life, and as their origin is still doubtful, it would\r\nobviously be futile to speculate upon the geographical conditions of\r\nthe earth's surface at the time of their formation. Reliable geological\r\nhistory only begins with the fossiliferous strata of the Palæozoic\r\nera. From these we learn that in the European area the Archæan rocks\r\nof Britain, Scandinavia, and Finland formed, at that time, the most\r\nextensive tract of dry land in our part of the world. How far beyond\r\nthe present limits of Europe that ancient northern land extended we\r\ncannot tell; but it probably occupied considerable regions which are\r\nnow submerged in the waters of the Arctic Ocean. Further south, the\r\ncontinental plateau appears to have been, for the most part, overflowed\r\nby a shallow sea, the surface of which was dotted by a few islands of\r\nArchæan rocks, occupying the sites of what are now some of the hills\r\nof middle Germany and the Archæan districts of France and the Iberian\r\nPeninsula. Archæan rocks occur likewise in Corsica and Sardinia,\r\nand again in Turkey: they also form the nuclei of most of the great\r\nEuropean mountain-chains, as the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Carpathians,\r\nand the Urals. These areas of crystalline schists may not, it is true,\r\nhave existed as islands at the beginning of Palæozoic times, for they\r\nwere doubtless ridged up by successive elevations at later dates; but\r\ntheir very presence as mountain-nuclei is sufficient to show that at\r\na very early geological period, the continental plateau could not\r\nhave been covered by any great depth of sea. We can go further than\r\nthis--for all the evidence points to the conclusion that, even so far\r\nback as Cambrian times, the dominant features of the present European\r\ncontinent had been, as it were, sketched out. Looked at broadly, that\r\npart of the great continental plateau upon which our European lands\r\nhave been gradually built up may be said to be traversed from west to\r\neast by two wide depressions, separated by an intervening elevated\r\ntract. The former of these depressions corresponds to the great Central\r\nPlain which passes through the south of England, north-east of France,\r\nand the Low Countries, whence it sweeps through Germany, to expand into\r\nthe extensive low-grounds of central and northern Russia. The southern\r\ndepression embraces the maritime tracts of the Mediterranean, and the\r\nregions which that sea covers. To these dominant features all the\r\nothers are of subordinate importance. The two great troughs are belts\r\nof depression in the continental plateau itself. The northern one is of\r\nextreme antiquity--it is older, at all events, than the Cambro-Silurian\r\nperiod. Even at that distant date its southern limits were marked\r\nout by ridges of Archæan rock, which, as I have said, seem to have\r\nformed islands in what is now central Europe. It was probably always\r\nthe shallower depression of the two, for we have evidence to show that\r\nagain and again, in Mesozoic and later times, the sea that overflowed\r\nwhat are now the central lowlands of Europe was of less considerable\r\ndepth than that which occupied the Mediterranean trough.\r\n\r\n[DJ] I need hardly remind geologists that some of the so-called\r\n\"Archæan schists\" may really be the highly altered accumulations of\r\nlater geological periods.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to North America, we find similar reason to conclude, with\r\nProfessor Dana, that the general topography of that region had likewise\r\nbeen foreshadowed as far back as the beginning of the Palæozoic era.\r\nDana tells us that even then the formation of its chief mountain-chains\r\nhad been commenced, and its great intermediate basins were already\r\ndefined. The oldest lands of North America were built up, as in\r\nEurope, of azoic rocks, and were grouped chiefly in the north. Archæan\r\nmasses extend over an enormous region, from the shores of the Arctic\r\nOcean down to the great lake country, and they are seen likewise in\r\nGreenland and many of the Arctic islands. They appear also in the\r\nlong mountain-chains that run parallel with the coast-lines of the\r\nContinent. In a word, the present distribution of the Archæan rocks,\r\nand their relation to overlying strata, lead to the belief that in\r\nNorth America, just as in Europe, they form the foundation-stones of\r\nthat continent, and stretch continuously throughout its whole extent.\r\n\r\nWe know comparatively little of the geology of the other great\r\nland-masses of the globe, but from such evidence as we have there is\r\nreason to believe that these in their general structure have much the\r\nsame story to tell as Europe and North America. In South America,\r\nArchæan rocks extend over vast areas in the east and north-east, and\r\nreappear in the lofty mountain-chains of the Pacific border. They have\r\nbeen recognised also in various parts of Africa, alike in the north\r\nand east, in the interior, and in the west and south. In Asia, again,\r\nthey occupy wide areas in the Indian Peninsula; they are well developed\r\nin the Himalaya, while in China and the mountains and plateaux of\r\ncentral Asia, azoic rocks, which are probably of Archæan age, are well\r\ndeveloped. The crystalline schists, which cover extensive tracts in\r\nAustralia and in the northern island of New Zealand, have also been\r\nreferred to the same age. Thus, all the world over, Archæan rocks seem\r\nto form the surface of the ancient continental plateau upon which all\r\nother sedimentary strata have been accumulated. And in every region\r\nwhere Palæozoic rocks occur, we have evidence to prove that at the time\r\nthese last were formed vast areas of the old continental plateau were\r\nunder water.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of the Palæozoic tracts of Europe and America\r\nhas shown us that, during the protracted period of their accumulation,\r\nand notwithstanding many oscillations of level, the land-surface\r\ncontinued to increase. The same growth of dry land characterised\r\nMesozoic and Cainozoic times--the primeval depressions that traverse\r\nthe continental plateau became more and more silted up, and the sea\r\neventually disappeared from extensive regions which it had overflowed\r\nin Palæozoic ages. This land-growth, of course, was not everywhere\r\ncontinuous. Again and again, throughout wide tracts, depression was\r\nin excess of sedimentation and elevation. Even at the present time,\r\nbroad tracts of what was once dry land are submerged. But the simple\r\nfact that the younger fossiliferous strata do not extend over such wide\r\nareas as the older systems, is sufficient proof that our land-masses\r\nhave all along tended to grow, and to become more and more consolidated.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the remarkable fact that no abysmal\r\naccumulations have yet been detected amongst the stratified rocks of\r\nthe earth's crust. Ordinary clastic rocks, such as shale, sandstone,\r\nand conglomerate--altered or unaltered, as the case may be--form by\r\nfar the largest proportion of our aqueous strata, and speak to us only\r\nof shallow waters. It is true that some of our limestones must have\r\naccumulated in moderately deep clear seas, yet none of these limestones\r\nis of abysmal origin. They prove that portions of the continental\r\nplateau have now and again been submerged for several thousand feet,\r\nbut afford no evidence of depths comparable to those of the present\r\noceanic basins. The enormous thickness obtained by the sedimentary\r\nstrata can only be explained on the supposition that deposition took\r\nplace over a gradually sinking area. And thus it can be shown that,\r\nwithin the continental plateau, movements of depression have been\r\ncarried on more or less continuously during vast periods of time--and\r\nyet so gradually, that sedimentation was able to keep pace with them.\r\nTake, for example, the Cambrian strata of Wales and Shropshire--all,\r\napparently, shallow-water deposits--which attain a thickness of 30,000\r\nfeet, or thereabout; or the Silurian strata of the same regions, which\r\nare not much less than 20,000 feet thick; and similar great depths of\r\nsedimentary rocks might be cited from North America. Passing on to\r\nlater periods, we find like evidence of long-continued depression in\r\nthe thick sediments of the younger Palæozoic systems. It is noteworthy,\r\nhowever, that when we come down to still later ages, the movements of\r\ndepression, as measured by the depths of the strata, appear to have\r\nbecome less and less extensive and profound. Each such movement of\r\ndepression was eventually brought to a close by one or more movements\r\nof upheaval--slowly or more rapidly effected, as the case may have\r\nbeen. Here, then, we are confronted with the striking fact that the\r\ncontinental plateau has, from time to time, sunk down over wide areas\r\nto depths exceeding those of existing oceans, and yet at so slow a\r\nrate, that sedimentation prevented the depressed regions from becoming\r\nabysmal. It is obvious, then, that such areas are now dry land simply\r\nbecause, in the long-run, sedimentation and upheaval have been in\r\nexcess of depression.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding the numerous upheavals which have taken place\r\nover the continental plateau, these have succeeded in doing little\r\nmore than drain away the sea more or less completely from the great\r\nprimeval depressions by which that plateau is traversed. If it be true,\r\ntherefore, that the continental plateau owes its existence to the\r\nsinking down of the earth's crust within the oceanic basins--if the\r\ncontinents have been squeezed up by the tangential thrusts exerted by\r\nthe sinking areas that surround them--then it follows that while lands\r\nhave been gradually extending over the continental plateau, the bed of\r\nthe ocean has been sinking to greater and greater depths.\r\n\r\nIf this general conclusion holds good, it is obvious that the oceanic\r\ntroughs of early geological times could not have been so deep as they\r\nare now. During the Palæozoic period, the most continuous areas of\r\ndry land, as we have seen, were distributed over the northern parts\r\nof our hemisphere, while, further south, groups of islands indicated\r\nthe continuation of the continental plateau. Doubtless South America,\r\nAfrica, Asia, and Australia were, at that distant date, represented by\r\nsimilar detached areas of dry land. In a word, the primeval continental\r\nplateau was still largely under water. Judging from the character and\r\nbroad distribution of the Palæozoic marine faunas the temperature of\r\nthe sea was wonderfully uniform. There is certainly nothing to indicate\r\nthe existence of such climatic zones as those of the present. We know\r\nvery little of the terrestrial life of early Palæozoic times--the\r\nCambro-Silurian strata are essentially marine. Land-plants, however,\r\nbecome more numerous in the Old Red Sandstone, and, as every one knows,\r\nthey abound in the succeeding Carboniferous and Permian systems. And\r\nthe testimony of these floras points to the same conclusion as that\r\nfurnished by the marine faunas. The Carboniferous floras of the arctic\r\nregions, and of temperate Europe and America, not only have the same\r\n_facies_, but a considerable number of the species is common to both\r\nareas; while many European species occur in the Carboniferous strata\r\nof Australia and other distant lands. This common _facies_, and the\r\npresence of numerous cosmopolitan forms, surely indicate the former\r\nprevalence of remarkably uniform climatic conditions. The conditions,\r\nof course, need not--indeed, could not--have been absolutely uniform.\r\nAt present the various climates which our globe experiences depend\r\nupon the amount of heat received directly and indirectly from the\r\nsun--oceanic and aërial currents everywhere modifying the results that\r\nare due to latitude. It cannot have been otherwise in former times.\r\nIn all ages the tropics must have received more direct sun-heat than\r\ntemperate and polar regions; and however much the climatic conditions\r\nof the Palæozoic era may have differed from the present--however\r\nuniformly temperature may have been distributed--still, as I have\r\nsaid, absolute uniformity was impossible. It was doubtless owing to\r\nthe fact that the dry lands of Palæozoic times were not only much less\r\nextensive than now, but more interrupted, straggling, and insular,\r\nthat the climate of the globe was so equable. Under such geographical\r\nconditions, great oceanic currents would have a much freer course than\r\nis now possible, and warm water would find its way readily across\r\nwide regions of the submerged continental plateau into the highest\r\nlatitudes. The winds blowing athwart the land would everywhere be moist\r\nand warm, and no such marked differences of temperature, such as now\r\nobtain, would distinguish the arctic seas from those of much lower\r\nlatitudes. At the same time, the comparatively shallow water overlying\r\nthe submerged areas of the continental plateau would favour the\r\ndistribution of species, and thus bring about that wide distribution of\r\ncosmopolitan forms and general similarity of _facies_, which are such\r\nmarked features of the Palæozoic faunas. It is even quite possible that\r\nmigration may have taken place here and there across the great oceanic\r\ndepression itself; for it may well be doubted whether, at so early a\r\nperiod, the depression had sunk down to its present depth below the\r\nlevel of the continental plateau.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding such facilities for migration, and the consequent\r\nsimilarity of _facies_ I have referred to, the Palæozoic faunas of\r\ndifferent regions have usually certain distinctive characters. Even at\r\nthe very dawn of the era the marine faunas were already grouped into\r\nprovinces, sometimes widely separated from one another, at other times\r\nclosely adjacent, so that it is evident that barriers to migration\r\nhere and there existed. It could hardly have been otherwise; for local\r\nand more widely-spread movements of elevation and depression took place\r\nagain and again during Palæozoic times.\r\n\r\nWhile the younger Palæozoic systems were being accumulated, excess\r\nof upheaval over depression resulted in the gradual increase of the\r\nland.[DK] The continental plateau came more and more to the surface,\r\nin spite of many oscillations of level. It is quite possible, nay,\r\neven probable that this persistent growth of land, and consequent\r\nmodification of oceanic currents may have rendered the climatic\r\nconditions of later Palæozoic times less uniform: but, if so, such\r\ndiminished uniformity has left no recognisable impress on either faunas\r\nor floras; for fossils characteristic of the Devonian and Carboniferous\r\nstrata of temperate latitudes occur far within the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\n[DK] See footnote p. 341.\r\n\r\nDescending to the Mesozoic era, we find that the character and\r\ndistribution of marine faunas are still indicative of uniformity.\r\nThere could have been little difference of temperature at that time\r\nbetween arctic seas and those of our own latitude. Cosmopolitan species\r\nabounded in the Jurassic waters, but were relatively less numerous\r\nin those of the Cretaceous period. Professor Neumayr maintains that\r\nalready, in the Jurassic period, the climate had become differentiated\r\ninto zones. This, he thinks, is indicated by the fact that coral reefs\r\nabound in the Jurassic strata of central Europe, while they are wanting\r\nin the contemporaneous deposits of boreal regions. Dr. Heilprin, on\r\nthe other hand, is of opinion that this and certain other distinctive\r\nfeatures of separate Jurassic life-provinces may not have been due to\r\ndifferences of temperature, but rather to varying physical conditions,\r\nsuch as character of the sea-bottom, depth of water, and so forth.\r\nPerhaps the safest conclusion we can come to, in the present state\r\nof the evidence, is that the climatic conditions of the Mesozoic era\r\nwere, upon the whole, less obviously uniform than those of earlier\r\nages, but that marked zones of climate like the present had not as\r\nyet been evolved. At the same time, when we consider how many great\r\ngeographical revolutions took place during the period in question, we\r\nmust be prepared to admit that these could hardly fail to influence the\r\nclimate, and thus to have induced modifications in the distribution of\r\nfaunas and floras. And probably evidence of such modifications will yet\r\nbe recognised, if indeed the phenomena referred to by Neumayr be not\r\na case in point. It may be noted, further, that while, according to\r\nmany botanists, the plants of the Palæozoic periods bespeak not only\r\nuniform climatic conditions but the absence of marked seasonal changes,\r\nthose of late Mesozoic times are indicative of less uniformity. The\r\nCretaceous conifers, for example, show regular rings of growth, and\r\nbetoken the existence of seasons, which were less marked, however, than\r\nis now the case.\r\n\r\nThe geographical changes of Mesozoic times were notable in many\r\nrespects. The dominant features of Europe, already foreshadowed in\r\nearly Palæozoic times, had become more clearly outlined before the\r\nclose of the Cretaceous period. Notwithstanding many movements of\r\ndepression, the chief land-areas continued to show themselves in the\r\nnorth and north-west. The highest grounds were the Urals, and the\r\nuplands of Scandinavia and Britain. In middle Europe the Pyrenees and\r\nthe Alps were as yet inconsiderable heights, the loftiest lands in that\r\nregion being those of the Harz, the Riesen Gebirge, and other tracts of\r\nArchæan and Palæozoic rocks. The lower parts of England and the great\r\nlowland plains of central Europe were sometimes submerged in the waters\r\nof a wide, shallow sea, but ever and anon elevation ensued, new lands\r\nappeared, and these waters became divided into a series of large inland\r\nseas and lakes. In the south, a deep Mediterranean sea would appear\r\nto have persisted all through the Mesozoic era--a sea of considerably\r\ngreater extent, however, than the present.\r\n\r\nWhile in Europe the dominant features of the continental plateau run\r\napproximately east and west, in North America they follow nearly the\r\nopposite direction. In early Mesozoic times, vast tracts of dry land\r\nextended across the northern and eastern sections of the latter area.\r\nOver the Rocky Mountain region, low lands and saline lakes appear\r\nto have stretched, while further west the area of the Great Plateau\r\nand the Pacific slope were covered by the sea. Towards the end of\r\nthe Mesozoic era, the land in the far west became more continuous--a\r\nbroad belt extending in the direction of the Pacific coast-line from\r\nMexico up to high northern latitudes. In short, before the Cretaceous\r\nperiod closed, the major portion of North America had been evolved. A\r\nconsiderable tract of what is now the western margin of the continent,\r\nhowever, was still under water, while from the Gulf of Mexico (then\r\nmuch wider than now) a broad Mediterranean sea swept north and\r\nnorth-west through Texas and the Rocky Mountain region to communicate\r\nwith the Arctic Ocean. All to the east of this inland sea was then, as\r\nit is now, dry land. Thus, up to the close of the Cretaceous period,\r\nin America and Europe alike, oceanic currents coming from the south\r\nhad ready access across the primeval continental plateau to the higher\r\nlatitudes. Southern Europe indeed, during Mesozoic times, was simply a\r\ngreat archipelago, having free communication on the one hand across the\r\nlow-grounds of central and northern Russia with the arctic seas, and,\r\non the other, across vast regions in Asia with the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nOf the other great land-masses of the globe our knowledge is too\r\nlimited to allow us to trace their geographical evolution with any\r\nconfidence. But from the very wide distribution of Mesozoic strata\r\nin South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia, there can be no doubt\r\nthat, at the time of their accumulation, enormous tracts in those\r\nregions were then under water. The land-masses, in short, were not so\r\ncontinuous and compact as they are at present. And although we must\r\ninfer that considerable areas of Mesozoic land are now submerged, yet\r\nthese cannot but bear a very small proportion to the wide regions which\r\nhave been raised above the sea-level since Mesozoic times. In short,\r\nfrom what we do know of the geological structure of the continents\r\nin question, we can hardly doubt that they have passed through\r\ngeographical revolutions of a like kind with those of Europe and North\r\nAmerica. Everywhere over the great continental plateau elevation\r\nappears, in the long-run, to have been in excess of depression, so\r\nthat, in spite of many subsidences, the tendency of the land throughout\r\nthe world has been to extend its margins, and to become more and\r\nmore consolidated. The Mesozoic lands were larger than those of the\r\npreceding Palæozoic era, but they were still penetrated in many places\r\nby the sea, and warm currents could make their way over wide tracts\r\nthat are now raised above the sea-level. Under such circumstances\r\napproximately uniform conditions of climate could not but obtain.\r\n\r\nGreat geographical changes supervened upon the close of the Cretaceous\r\nperiod. North America then acquired nearly its present outline.\r\nIts Mediterranean sea had vanished, but the Gulf of Mexico still\r\noverflowed a considerably wider region than now, while a narrow margin\r\nof the Pacific border of the continent continued submerged. In Europe\r\nelevation ensued, and the sea which had overspread so much of the\r\ncentral and eastern portions of our Continent disappeared. Southern\r\nEurope, however, was still largely under water, while bays and inlets\r\nextended northwards into what are now the central regions of the\r\nContinent. On to the close of the Miocene period, indeed, the southern\r\nand south-eastern tracts of Europe were represented by straggling\r\nislands. In middle Cainozoic times the Alps, which had hitherto been of\r\nsmall importance, were considerably upheaved, as were also the Pyrenees\r\nand the Carpathians; and a subsequent great elevation of the Alpine\r\narea was effected after the Miocene period. Notwithstanding these\r\ngigantic movements, the low-lying tracts of what is now southern Europe\r\ncontinued to be largely submerged, and even the central regions of the\r\nContinent were now and again occupied by broad lakes, which sometimes\r\ncommunicated with the sea. After the elevation of the Miocene strata,\r\nthese inland seas disappeared, but the Mediterranean still overflowed\r\nwider areas than it does to-day. Eventually, however, in late Pliocene\r\ntimes, the bed of that sea experienced considerable elevation; and it\r\nwas probably at or about this stage that the Black Sea and the Sea of\r\nAsov retreated from the broad low-grounds of southern Russia, and that\r\nthe inland seas and lakes of Austria-Hungary finally vanished.\r\n\r\nThe movements of upheaval, which caused the Cretaceous seas to\r\ndisappear from such broad areas of the continental plateau, induced\r\nmany changes in the floras and faunas of the globe. A notable break in\r\nthe succession occurs between the Cretaceous and the Eocene, hardly one\r\nspecies of higher grade than the protozoa passing from one system to\r\nthe other. In the Cainozoic deposits we are no longer confronted with\r\nnumerous cosmopolitan species--the range of marine forms has become\r\nmuch more restricted. Nevertheless, the faunas and floras continue\r\nto be indicative of much warmer climates for arctic and temperate\r\nlatitudes than now obtain. But, at the same time, differentiation\r\nof climate into zones is distinctly marked. In the early Cainozoic\r\nperiod, our present temperate latitudes supported a flora of decidedly\r\ntropical affinities, while the fauna of the adjacent seas had a\r\nsimilar character. Later on the climate of the same latitudes appears\r\nto have passed successively through sub-tropical and temperate\r\nstages. In short, a gradual lowering of the temperature is evinced\r\nby the character and distribution both of floras and faunas. The\r\ndifferentiation of the climate during one stage of the Cainozoic era is\r\nwell illustrated by the Miocene flora. Thus, at a time when Italy was\r\nclothed with a tropical vegetation, in which palm-trees predominated,\r\nmiddle Europe had its extensive forests of evergreens and conifers,\r\nwhile in the region of the Baltic conifers and deciduous trees were the\r\nprevalent forms.\r\n\r\nWhen one takes into consideration the fact that, notwithstanding many\r\noscillations of level, the land during Cainozoic times was gradually\r\nextending, and the sea disappearing from wide regions which it had\r\nformerly covered, one can hardly doubt that the seemingly gradual\r\nchange from tropical to temperate conditions was due, in large measure,\r\nto that persistent continental growth. I confess, however, that it is\r\ndifficult to account for the very genial climate which continued to\r\nprevail over the arctic regions. So far as one can gather from the\r\nevidence at present available, some of the marine approaches to those\r\nlatitudes had been cut off by the movements of elevation which brought\r\nthe Cainozoic era to a close, while the arctic lands were perhaps more\r\nextensive than they are now. The Cretaceous Mediterranean Sea of North\r\nAmerica had vanished, and we cannot prove that the Tertiary Sea of\r\nsouthern Europe communicated across the low-grounds of Russia with the\r\nArctic Ocean. We know, however, that the archipelago of southern Europe\r\nwas in direct connection with the Indian Ocean, and it is most probable\r\nthat a wide arm of the same sea stretched north from the Aralo-Caspain\r\narea through Siberia. Indeed, much of what are now the lowlands of\r\nwestern and northern Asia was probably sea in Tertiary times. It seems\r\nlikely, therefore, that, even at this late period, marine currents\r\ncontinued to reach the Arctic Zone across the continental plateau. When\r\nthe warm waters of the Indian Ocean eventually ceased to invade Europe,\r\nand the Mediterranean became much restricted in area, the climate of\r\nthe whole Continent could not fail to be profoundly affected.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another line of evidence to which brief reference may be\r\nmade. I have spoken of the remarkable uniformity of climatic conditions\r\nwhich obtained in Palæozoic times, and of the gradual modification\r\nof these conditions which subsequently supervened. Now, it is worthy\r\nof note that in their lithological characters the oldest sedimentary\r\nstrata themselves likewise exhibit a prevalent uniformity which in\r\nlater systems becomes less and less conspicuous. The Cambro-Silurian\r\nmechanical sediments, for example, maintain much the same character\r\nall the world over; and the like is true, although in a less degree,\r\nof the marine accumulations of the Devonian period. The corresponding\r\nmechanical deposits of later Palæozoic ages continue to show more\r\nand more diversity, but at the same time they preserve a similarity\r\nof character over much more extensive areas than is found to be the\r\ncase with the analogous sediments of the Mesozoic era. Finally, these\r\nlast are more or less strongly contrasted with the marine mechanical\r\naccumulations of Cainozoic times, which are altogether more local in\r\ncharacter. This increasing differentiation is quite in keeping with\r\nwhat we know of the evolution of our land-areas. In early Palæozoic\r\nages, when insular conditions prevailed and the major portion of the\r\nprimeval continental plateau was covered by shallow seas, it is obvious\r\nthat mechanical sediments would be swept by tidal and other currents\r\nover enormous areas, and that these sediments would necessarily assume\r\na more or less uniform character. Indeed, I suspect that much of the\r\nsediment of those early seas may have been the result of tidal scour,\r\nand that marine erosion was more generally effective then than it is\r\nnow. With the gradual growth of the land and the consequent deflection\r\nand limitation of currents, marine mechanical sediments would tend\r\nto become more and more local in character. Thus the increasing\r\ndifferentiation which we observe in passing from the earlier to the\r\nlater geological systems is just what might have been expected.\r\n\r\nSumming up, now, the results of this rapid review of the evidence, we\r\nseem justified in coming to the following conclusions:--\r\n\r\n(1.) In Palæozoic times, Europe and North America were represented\r\nby considerable areas of dry land, massed chiefly in the higher\r\nlatitudes, while further south groups of smaller islands were scattered\r\nover the submerged surface of the primeval continental plateau. The\r\nother continents appear, in like manner, to have been represented\r\nby islands--some of which may have reached continental dimensions.\r\nA very remarkable uniformity of climate accompanied these peculiar\r\ngeographical conditions.\r\n\r\n(2.) In Mesozoic times, the primeval continental plateau came more and\r\nmore to the surface, but the land-areas were still much interrupted, so\r\nthat currents from tropical regions continued to have ready access to\r\nhigh latitudes. The climate of the whole globe, therefore, was still\r\nuniform, but apparently not so markedly as in the preceding era.\r\n\r\n(3.) In Cainozoic times, the land-masses continued to extend, and\r\nthe sea to retreat from hitherto submerged areas of the continental\r\nplateau; and this persistent land-growth was accompanied by a gradual\r\nlowering of the temperature of northern and temperate latitudes, and a\r\nmore and more marked differentiation of climate into zones.\r\n\r\nHaving thus very briefly sketched the geographical evolution of the\r\nland during Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary times, and come to the\r\ngeneral conclusion that climate has varied according to the relative\r\nposition of land and sea, I have next to consider the geographical\r\nand climatic conditions of the Quaternary period. These, however,\r\nare now so well known, that I need to no more than remind you that,\r\nso far as the chief features of our lands are considered, all these\r\nhad come into existence before the dawn of the Ice Age. The greater\r\ncontours of the surface, which were foreshadowed in Palæozoic times,\r\nand which in Mesozoic times were more clearly indicated, had been fully\r\nevolved by the close of the Pliocene period. The connection between the\r\nMediterranean and the Indian Ocean probably ceased in late Pliocene\r\ntimes. The most remarkable geographical changes which have taken place\r\nsince then within European regions have been successive elevations\r\nand depressions, in consequence of which the area of our Continent\r\nhas been alternately increased and diminished. At a time well within\r\nthe human period, our own islands have been united to themselves and\r\nthe Continent, and the dry land has extended north-west and north, so\r\nas to include Spitzbergen, the Faröe Islands, and perhaps Iceland. On\r\nthe other hand, our islands have been within a recent period largely\r\nsubmerged. Similarly, in North America, we are furnished with many\r\nproofs of like oscillations of level having taken place in Quaternary\r\ntimes. Is it possible, then, to explain the climatic vicissitudes of\r\nthe Pleistocene period by means of such oscillations? Many geologists\r\nhave tried to do so, but all these attempts have failed. It is quite\r\ntrue that a general elevation of the land in high latitudes would\r\ngreatly increase the ice-fields of arctic regions, and might even give\r\nrise to perennial snow and glaciers in the mountain-districts of our\r\nislands. But it is inconceivable that any such geographical change\r\ncould have brought about that general lowering of temperature over the\r\nwhole northern hemisphere which took place in Pleistocene times. For we\r\nhave to account not only for the excessive glaciation of northern and\r\nnorth-western Europe, and of the northern parts of North America, but\r\nfor the appearance of snow-fields and glaciers in much more southern\r\nlatitudes, and in many parts of Asia where no perennial snow now\r\nexists. Moreover, we have to remember that arctic conditions of climate\r\nobtained in north-western Europe even when the land was relatively much\r\nlower than it is at present. The arctic shell-beds of our own and other\r\ntemperate regions sufficiently prove that geographical conditions were\r\nnot the only factor concerned in bringing about the peculiar climate of\r\nthe Pleistocene period. Then, again, we must not forget that at certain\r\nstages of the same period genial conditions of climate were coincident\r\nwith a much wider land-surface in north-western Europe than now exists.\r\nThe very fact that interglacial deposits occur in every glaciated\r\nregion is enough of itself to show that the arctic conditions of the\r\nPleistocene could not have resulted entirely from a mere elevation of\r\nland in the northern parts of our hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation of the peculiar climatic vicissitudes in question\r\nwhich seems to meet the facts, so far as these have been ascertained,\r\nis the well-known theory advanced by Dr. Croll. After carefully\r\nconsidering all the objections which have been urged against that\r\ntheory, there is only one, as it seems to me, that is deserving of\r\nserious attention. This objection is not based on any facts connected\r\nwith the Pleistocene deposits themselves, but on evidence of quite\r\nanother kind. It is admitted that were the Pleistocene deposits alone\r\nconsidered, Croll's theory would fully account for the phenomena.\r\nBut, it is argued, we cannot take the Pleistocene by itself, for\r\nif that theory be true, then climatic conditions similar to those\r\nof the Pleistocene must have supervened again and again during the\r\npast. Where, then, we are asked, is there any evidence in Palæozoic,\r\nMesozoic, or Cainozoic strata of former widespread glacial conditions?\r\nIf continental ice-sheets, comparable to those of the Pleistocene,\r\never existed in the earlier ages, surely we ought to find more or\r\nless unmistakable traces of them. Now, at first sight, this looks\r\na very plausible objection, but it has always seemed to me to be\r\nbased upon an assumption that is not warranted by our knowledge of\r\ngeographical evolution. Dr. Croll always admitted implicitly that high\r\neccentricity of the earth's orbit might have happened again and again\r\nwithout inducing glacial conditions like those of the Pleistocene. The\r\nobjection takes no account of the fact that the excessive climate of\r\nthe Glacial period was only possible because of special geographical\r\nconditions--conditions that do not appear to have been fully evolved\r\nbefore Pliocene times. No one has seen this more clearly than Mr.\r\nWallace,[DL] with the general drift of whose argument I am quite at\r\none. In earlier ages, the warm water of the tropics overflowed wide\r\nareas of our present continents--most of the dry land was more or\r\nless insular, and the seas within the Arctic Circle were certainly\r\nnot cold as at present, but temperate and even genial. If we go back\r\nto Cambro-Silurian times, we find only the nuclei, as it were, of our\r\nexisting continents appearing above the surface of widespread shallow\r\nseas. It is quite impossible, therefore, that under such geographical\r\nconditions, great continuous ice-sheets, like those of the Pleistocene,\r\ncould have existed--no matter how high the eccentricity of the earth's\r\norbit may have been. The most that could have happened during such\r\na period of eccentricity would be the accumulation of snow-fields on\r\nmountains and plateaux of sufficient height, the formation here and\r\nthere of local glaciers, and the descent of these in some places to the\r\nsea. And what evidence of such local glaciation might we now expect\r\nto find? No old land-surface of that far-distant period has come down\r\nto us: we look in vain for Cambro-Silurian _roches moutonnées_ and\r\nboulder-clay or moraines. The only evidence we could expect is just\r\nthat which actually occurs, namely, erratics (some of them measuring\r\nfive feet and more in diameter) embedded in marine deposits. It may\r\nbe said that a few erratics are hardly sufficient to prove that a\r\ntrue Glacial period supervened in Cambro-Silurian times, and I do not\r\ninsist that they are. But I certainly maintain that if any lowering\r\nof the temperature were induced by high eccentricity of the earth's\r\norbit during Cambro-Silurian times, then ice-floated erratics are the\r\nonly evidence of refrigeration that we need ever hope to find. The\r\ngeographical conditions of early Palæozoic times forbade the formation\r\nof enormous ice-sheets like those of the Pleistocene period. Extreme\r\nclimatic changes were then impossible, and periods of high eccentricity\r\nmight have come and gone without inducing any modifications of\r\nflora and fauna which we could now recognise. We are ignorant of\r\nthe terrestrial life of the globe at that distant period, and our\r\nknowledge of the marine fauna is not sufficient to enable us to deny\r\nthe possibility of moderate fluctuations in the temperature of the seas\r\nof early Palæozoic times. Moreover, we must not forget there were then\r\nno such barriers to migration as now exist. If the conditions became\r\ntemporarily unsuitable, marine organisms were free to migrate into\r\nmore genial waters, and to return to their former habitats when the\r\nunfavourable conditions had passed away.\r\n\r\n[DL] See _Island Life_.\r\n\r\nThe uniform climate so characteristic of the Cambro-Silurian period\r\nappears to have prevailed likewise during the later stages of the\r\nPalæozoic era. This we gather from a general consideration of the\r\nfloras and faunas, and their geographical distribution. The dry land,\r\nas we have seen, continued to increase in extent; but vast areas of\r\nthe primeval continental plateau of the globe still continued under\r\nwater, and currents from southern latitudes flowed unrestricted into\r\npolar regions. During the protracted lapse of time required for the\r\nformation of the later Palæozoic systems several periods of high\r\neccentricity must have occurred. But, so far as one can judge, the\r\ndisposition of the larger land-areas was never such as to induce a\r\ntrue Ice Age. Nevertheless we are not without evidence of ice-action\r\nin Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous, and Permian strata. And it seems\r\nto me probable that the erratic accumulations referred to may really\r\nindicate local action, of more or less intensity, brought about by such\r\nlowering of the temperature as would supervene during a period of high\r\neccentricity. It is true we may explain the phenomena by inferring the\r\nexistence of mountains of sufficient elevation--and this, indeed, is\r\nthe usual explanation. But it is doubtful whether those who adopt that\r\nview have fully considered what it involves. Take, for example, the\r\ncase of the breccias and conglomerates of the Lammermuir Hills, which\r\nhave all the appearance of being glacial and fluvio-glacial detritus.\r\nThese deposits overlie the highly-denuded Silurian greywackés of\r\nHaddingtonshire in the north and of Berwickshire in the south, and have\r\nevidently been derived from the intervening high-grounds--the width of\r\nwhich between the Old Red Sandstone accumulations in question does not\r\nexceed eight or nine miles. The breccias reach a height of 1300 feet,\r\nwhile the dominating point of the intervening uplands is 1700 feet.\r\nUnder present geographical conditions it is doubtful whether perennial\r\nsnow and glaciers of any size at all could exist in the region of the\r\nLammermuirs at a less altitude than 7000 feet or more. But between\r\nthe breccias of Haddingtonshire and the equivalent deposits in\r\nBerwickshire there is no space for any intermediate range of mountains\r\nof circumdenudation of such a height. Moreover, we must remember that\r\nunder the extremely uniform conditions which obtained in Palæozoic\r\ntimes the snow-line could not possibly have been attained even at that\r\nelevation. When the Devonian coral-reefs described by Dupont were\r\ngrowing in the sea that overflowed western Europe, to what height must\r\nthe southern uplands of Scotland have been elevated in order to reach\r\nthe snow-line! We may make what allowance we choose for the denudation\r\nwhich the Silurian rocks of the Lammermuirs must have experienced since\r\nthe deposition of the Old Red Sandstone, but it is simply a physical\r\nimpossibility that mountains of circumdenudation of the desiderated\r\nheight could ever have existed in the Lammermuir region at the time the\r\ncoarse breccias were being accumulated.[DM] It seems to me, then, that\r\nthese breccias are in every way better accounted for by a lowering of\r\ntemperature due to increased eccentricity of the orbit. This view frees\r\nus from the necessity of postulating excessive upheavals over very\r\nrestricted areas, and of creating Alps where no Alps could have existed.\r\n\r\n[DM] It may be objected that the conglomerates were probably not\r\nmarine, but deposited in lakes, the beds of which may have been much\r\nabove sea-level. But from all that we know of the Old Red Sandstone of\r\nScotland it would appear that the lakes of the period now and again\r\ncommunicated with the sea, and were probably never much above its level.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the enormous thickness of the strata that constitute\r\nany of our larger coal-fields, we can hardly doubt that one or\r\nmore periods of high eccentricity must have occurred during their\r\naccumulation. It does not follow, however, that we should be able\r\nto detect in these strata any evidence of alternating cold and warm\r\nepochs. So long as ocean-currents from the tropics found ready entrance\r\nto polar regions across vast tracts of what is now dry land, extreme\r\nand widespread glacial conditions were impossible. Any lowering of\r\ntemperature due to cosmical causes might indeed induce new snow-fields\r\nand glaciers to appear, or existing ones to extend themselves in\r\nnorthern regions and the most elevated lands of lower latitudes; but\r\nsuch local glaciation need not have seriously affected any of the\r\nareas in which coal-seams were being formed. For nothing appears more\r\ncertain than this--that our coal-seams as a rule were formed over\r\nbroad, low-lying alluvial lands, and in swamps and marshes, along\r\nthe margins of estuaries or shallow bays of the sea. Some seams, it\r\nis true, are evidently formed of drifted vegetable débris, but the\r\nmajority point to growth _in situ_. The strata with which they are\r\nassociated are shallow-water sediments which could only have been\r\ndeposited at some considerable distance from any mountain-regions in\r\nwhich glaciers were likely to exist. It is idle, therefore, to ask for\r\nevidence of glacial action amongst strata formed under such conditions.\r\nThe only evidence of ice-work we are likely to get is that of erratics.\r\nAnd these are not wanting, although it is probable that most of those\r\nwhich are found embedded in coals have been transported by rafts of\r\nvegetable matter or in the roots of trees. The same explanation,\r\nhowever, will not account for the boulders which Sir William Dawson\r\nhas recorded from the coal-fields of Nova Scotia. He describes them as\r\noccurring on the outside of a gigantic esker of Carboniferous age, and\r\nthinks they were probably dropped there by floating-ice at a time when\r\ncoal-plants were flourishing in the swamps on the other side of the\r\ngravel embankment.\r\n\r\nIf the disposition of the land-areas in Carboniferous times rendered\r\nsuch an ice-age as that of the Pleistocene impossible--in other words,\r\nif the effects flowing from high eccentricity of the orbit must to\r\na large extent have been neutralised--the flora and fauna of the\r\nperiod can hardly be expected to yield any recognisable evidence of\r\nfluctuating climatic conditions. When our winter happened in aphelion\r\nnew snow-fields might have appeared, or already existing glaciers\r\nmight have increased in size; while, with the winter in perihelion,\r\nthe temperature in northern latitudes would doubtless be raised. But\r\nthe general result would simply be an alternation of warm and somewhat\r\ncooler conditions. And such fluctuations of climate might readily have\r\ntaken place without materially modifying; the life of the period.\r\n\r\nThe breccias of the Permian system have been described by Ramsay as\r\nof glacial origin. Some geologists agree with him, while others do\r\nnot--and many have been the ingenious suggestions which these last\r\nhave advanced in explanation of the phenomena. Some have tried to\r\nshow how the stones and blocks in the breccias may have been striated\r\nwithout having recourse to the agency of glacier-ice, but they cannot\r\nexplain away the fact that many of the stones (which vary in size\r\nfrom a few inches to three or four feet in diameter) have travelled\r\ndistances of thirty or forty miles from the parent rocks. Similar\r\nerratic accumulations, which may belong to the same system or to the\r\nCarboniferous, occur in India and Australia. According to Dr. Blanford,\r\nthe Indian boulder-beds are clearly indicative of ice-action, and\r\nhe does not think that they can be explained by an assumed former\r\nelevation of the Himalaya. On the contrary, he is of opinion that the\r\nfacts are best accounted for by a general lowering of the temperature,\r\ndue probably to the action of cosmical causes. Daintree, Wilkinson, R.\r\nOldham, and others who have studied the Australian erratic beds have\r\nlikewise stated their belief that these are of true glacial origin.\r\n\r\nI may pass rapidly over the Mesozoic systems, taking note, however,\r\nof the fact that in them we encounter evidence of ice-action of much\r\nthe same kind as that met with in Palæozoic strata. While, on the\r\none hand, the Mesozoic floras and faunas bespeak climatic conditions\r\nsimilar to those of earlier ages, but probably not quite so uniform; on\r\nthe other, the occurrence of erratics in various marine accumulations\r\nis sufficient to show that now and again ice floated across seas,\r\nthe floors of which were tenanted by reef-building corals. The\r\ngeographical conditions continued unfavourable to the formation of\r\nextensive ice-sheets in temperate latitudes, no matter how high the\r\neccentricity of the orbit might have been. The erratics which occur\r\nin certain Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits are admitted by most\r\ngeologists to have been ice-borne. Now, it is highly improbable that\r\nthe transporting agent could have been coast-ice, for it is hardly\r\npossible to conceive of ice forming on the surface of a sea in which\r\nflourished an abundant Mesozoic fauna. The erratics, therefore, seem\r\nto imply the existence in Mesozoic times of local glaciers, which here\r\nand there descended to the sea, as in the north-east of Scotland. The\r\nerratics in the Scottish Jurassic are evidently of native origin, and\r\nit is most improbable that those which have been met with in the Chalk\r\nof England and France could have floated from any very great distance.\r\nHow, then, can we explain the appearance of local glaciers in these\r\nlatitudes during Mesozoic times? The geographical conditions of the\r\nperiod could not have favoured the formation of perennial snow and ice\r\nin our area, unless our lands were at that time much more elevated than\r\nnow. And this is the usual explanation. It is supposed that mountains\r\nmuch higher than any we now possess probably existed in such regions\r\nas the Scottish Highlands. It is easy to imagine the former existence\r\nof such mountains. So long a time has elapsed since the Jurassic\r\nperiod, that the Archæan and Palæozoic areas cannot but have suffered\r\nprodigious denudation in the interval. But, when one considers how\r\nvery lofty, indeed, those mountains must have been, in order to reach\r\nthe snow-line of Jurassic times, one may be excused for expressing a\r\ndoubt as to whether the suggested explanation is reasonable. At all\r\nevents, the phenomena are, to say the least, as readily explicable on\r\nthe supposition that the snow-line was temporarily lowered by cosmical\r\ncauses. Even with eccentricity at a high value, no great ice-sheets,\r\nindeed, could have existed, but local snow-fields and glaciers might\r\nhave appeared in such mountain-regions as were of sufficient height.\r\nAnd this might have happened without producing any great difference\r\nin the temperature of the sea, or any marked modification in the\r\ndistribution of life. In short, we should simply have, as before,\r\nan alternation of warm and somewhat cooler climates, but nothing\r\napproaching to the glacial and interglacial epochs of the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions seem to me to be strongly supported by the evidence\r\nof ice-action during Tertiary times. The gigantic erratics of the\r\nAlpine Eocene do not appear to have been derived from the Alps, but\r\nrather from the Archæan area of southern Bohemia. The strata in which\r\nthey occur are, for the most part, unfossiliferous; they contain only\r\nfucoidal remains, and are presumably marine. How is it possible to\r\naccount for the appearance of these erratics in marine deposits in\r\ncentral Europe at a time when, as evidenced by the Eocene flora and\r\nfauna the climate was warm? Are we to infer the former existence of an\r\nextremely lofty range of Bohemian Alps which has since vanished? Is\r\nit not more probable that here, too, we have evidence of a lowering\r\nof the snow-line, induced by cosmical causes, which brought about the\r\nappearance of snow-fields and glaciers in a mountain-tract of much\r\nless elevation than would have been required in the absence of high\r\neccentricity of the orbit? If it be objected that such cosmical causes\r\nmust have had some effect upon the distribution of life, I reply\r\nthat very probably they had, although not to any extreme extent. The\r\nresearches of Mr. Starkie Gardner have shown that the flora of the\r\nEnglish Eocene affords distinct evidence of climatic changes. But as\r\nthe geographical conditions of that period precluded the possibility of\r\nextensive glaciation, and could only, at the most, have induced local\r\nglaciers to appear in elevated mountain-regions, it seems idle to cite\r\nthe non-occurrence of erratics and morainic accumulations in the Eocene\r\nof England and France as an argument against the application of Croll's\r\ntheory to the case of the erratics of the Flysch. I repeat, then, that\r\nunder the geographical conditions of the Eocene, all the more obvious\r\neffects likely to have resulted from the passage of a period of high\r\neccentricity would be the appearance of a few local glaciers, the\r\nexistence of which could have had no more influence on the climate of\r\nadjacent lowlands than is notable in similar circumstances in our own\r\nday. It is absurd, therefore, to expect to find evidence in Eocene\r\nstrata of as strongly contrasted climates as those of the glacial and\r\ninterglacial deposits of the Pleistocene. There must, doubtless, have\r\nbeen alternations of climate in our hemisphere; but these would consist\r\nsimply of passages from warm to somewhat cooler conditions--just such\r\nchanges, in fact, as are suggested by the plants of the English Eocene.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of ice-action in the Miocene strata is even more striking\r\nthan that of which I have just been speaking. The often-cited case\r\nof the erratics of the Superga near Turin I need do little more\r\nthan mention. These erratics were undoubtedly carried by icebergs,\r\ncalved from Alpine glaciers at a time when northern Italy was largely\r\nsubmerged. The erratic deposits are unfossiliferous, and are underlaid\r\nand overlaid by fossiliferous strata, in none of which are any erratics\r\nto be found. What is the meaning of these intercalated glacial\r\naccumulations? Can we believe it possible that the Miocene glaciers\r\nwere enabled to reach the sea in consequence of a sudden movement\r\nof elevation, which must have been confined to the Alps themselves?\r\nThen, if this be so, we must go a step further, and suppose that,\r\nafter some little time, the Alps were again suddenly depressed, so\r\nthat the glaciers at once ceased to reach the sea-coast. For, as Dr.\r\nCroll has remarked, \"had the lowering of the Alps been effected by\r\nthe slow process of denudation, it must have taken a long course of\r\nages to have lowered them to the extent of bringing the glacial state\r\nto a close.\" And we should, in such a case, find a succession of beds\r\nindicating a more or less protracted continuance of glacial conditions,\r\nand not one set of erratic accumulations intercalated amongst strata,\r\nthe organic remains in which are clearly suggestive of a warm climate.\r\nThe occurrence of erratics in the Miocene of Italy is all the more\r\ninteresting from the fact that in the Miocene of France and Spain\r\nsimilar evidence of ice-action is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nOpponents of Dr. Croll's theory have made much of Baron Nordenskiöld's\r\nstatement that he could find no trace of former glacial action in any\r\nof the fossiliferous formations within the Arctic regions. He is\r\nconvinced that \"an examination of the geognostic condition, and an\r\ninvestigation of the fossil flora and fauna of the polar lands, show\r\nno signs of a glacial era having existed in those parts before the\r\ntermination of the Miocene period.\" Well, as we have seen, there is no\r\nreason to believe that the geographical conditions in our hemisphere,\r\nat any time previous to the close of the Pliocene period, could have\r\ninduced glacial conditions comparable to those of the Pleistocene Ice\r\nAge. The strata referred to by Nordenskiöld, are, for the most part,\r\nof marine origin, and their faunas are sufficient to show us that the\r\nArctic seas were formerly temperate and genial. If any ice existed\r\nthen, it could only have been in the form of glaciers on elevated\r\nlands. And it is quite possible that these, during periods of high\r\neccentricity, may have descended to the sea and calved their icebergs;\r\nand, if so, erratics may yet be found embedded here and there in the\r\nArctic fossiliferous formations, although Nordenskiöld failed to see\r\nthem. One might sail all round the Palæozoic coast-lines of Scotland\r\nwithout being able to observe erratics in the strata, and yet, as we\r\nknow, these have been encountered in the interior of the country.\r\nThe wholesale scattering of erratics at any time previous to the\r\nPleistocene, must have been exceptional even in arctic regions, and\r\nconsequently one is not surprised that they do not everywhere stare the\r\nobserver in the face.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion, then, to which I think we may reasonably\r\ncome, is simply this:--That geological climate has been determined\r\nchiefly by geographical conditions. So long as the lands of the\r\nglobe were discontinuous and of relatively small extent, warm\r\nocean-currents reaching polar regions produced a general uniformity\r\nof temperature--the climate of the terrestrial areas being more or\r\nless markedly insular in character. Under these conditions, the sea\r\nwould nowhere be frozen. But when the land-masses became more and more\r\nconsolidated, when owing to the growth of the continents the warm\r\nocean-currents found less ready access to arctic regions, then the\r\ntemperature of those regions was gradually lowered, until eventually\r\nthe seas became frost-bound, and the lands were covered with snow and\r\nice. But while the chief determining cause of climate has been the\r\nrelative distribution of land and water, it is impossible to doubt that\r\nduring periods of high eccentricity of the orbit, the climate must\r\nhave been modified to a greater or less extent. In our own day the\r\ngeographical conditions are such that, were eccentricity to attain a\r\nhigh value, the climate of the Pleistocene would be reproduced, and our\r\nhemisphere would experience a succession of alternating cold and genial\r\nepochs.\r\n\r\nBut in earlier stages of the world's history, the geographical\r\nconditions were not of a kind to favour the accumulation of vast\r\nice-fields. During a period of extreme eccentricity, there would\r\nprobably be fluctuations of temperature in high latitudes; but nothing\r\nlike the glacial and interglacial epochs of the Pleistocene could\r\nhave occurred. At most, there would be a general lowering of the\r\ntemperature, sufficient to render the climate of arctic seas and lands\r\nsomewhat cooler, and probably to induce the appearance in suitable\r\nplaces of local glaciers; and, owing to precession of the equinox,\r\nthese cooler conditions would be followed by a general elevation of\r\nthe temperature above the normal for the geographical conditions of\r\nthe period. In Palæozoic and Mesozoic times, the effects of high\r\neccentricity of the orbit appear to have been, in a great measure,\r\nneutralised by the geographical conditions, with a possible exception\r\nin the Permian period. But in Tertiary times, when the land-masses had\r\nbecome more continuous, the cosmical causes of change referred to must\r\nhave had greater influence. And I cannot help agreeing with Dr. Croll\r\nthat the warm climates of the Arctic regions during that era were, to\r\nsome extent, the result of high eccentricity.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this discussion, I readily admit that our knowledge\r\nof geographical evolution is as yet in its infancy. We have still\r\nvery much to learn, and no one will venture to dogmatise upon the\r\nsubject. But I hope I have made it clear that the evidence, so far\r\nas it goes, does not justify the confident assertions of Dr. Croll's\r\nopponents, that his theory is contradicted by what we know of the\r\nclimatic conditions of Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic times. On\r\nthe contrary, it seems to me to gain additional support from the very\r\nevidence to which Nordenskiöld and others have appealed.\r\n\r\n  Note.--The accompanying sketch-maps (Plate IV.) require a few words\r\n  of explanation. The geology of the world is still so imperfectly\r\n  known that any attempt at graphic representation of former\r\n  geographical conditions cannot but be unsatisfactory. The approximate\r\n  positions of the chief areas of predominant elevation and depression\r\n  during stated periods of the past may have been ascertained in a\r\n  general way; but when we try to indicate these upon a map, such\r\n  provisional reconstructions are apt to suggest a more precise and\r\n  definite knowledge than is at present attainable. For it must be\r\n  confessed that there is hardly a line upon the small maps (A, B,\r\n  C) which might not have been drawn differently. This, of course,\r\n  is more especially true of South America, Africa, Asia--of large\r\n  areas of which the geological structure is unknown. But although the\r\n  boundaries of the land-masses shown upon the maps referred to are\r\n  thus confessedly provisional, the maps nevertheless bring out the\r\n  main fact of a gradual growth and consolidation of the land-areas--a\r\n  passage from insular to continental conditions. I need hardly say\r\n  this is no novel idea. It was clearly set forth by Professor Dana\r\n  upwards of forty years ago (_Silliman's Journal_, 1846, p. 352; 1847,\r\n  pp. 176, 381), and it received some years later further illustration\r\n  from Professor Guyot, who insisted upon the insular character of\r\n  the climate during Palæozoic times (_The Earth and Man_, 1850). It\r\n  must be understood that the maps (A, B, C) are not meant to exhibit\r\n  the geographical conditions of the world at any one point of time.\r\n  In Map A, for example, the area coloured blue was not necessarily\r\n  covered by sea at any particular stage in the Palæozoic era. It\r\n  simply represents approximately the regions tended. But, as already\r\n  stated, numerous oscillations of level occurred in Palæozoic times,\r\n  so that many changes in the distribution of land and water must have\r\n  taken place down to the close of the Permian period. The land-areas\r\n  shown upon the map are simply those which appear to have been more\r\n  or less persistent through all the geographical changes referred to.\r\n  Similar remarks apply to the other maps representing the more or\r\n  less persistent land-areas of Mesozoic and Tertiary times. Thus, for\r\n  example, there are reasons for believing that Madagascar was joined\r\n  to the mainland of Africa at some stage of the Mesozoic era, but was\r\n  subsequently insulated before Tertiary times. Again, as Mesozoic\r\n  era a land-connection obtained between New Zealand and Australia.\r\n  The same naturalist also points out that a chain of islands, now\r\n  represented by numerous islets and shoals, served in Tertiary times\r\n  to link Madagascar to India. Map D shows the areas of predominant\r\n  elevation and depression. The area coloured brown represents the\r\n  great continental plateau, which extends downwards to 1000 fathoms or\r\n  so below the present sea-level. The area tinted blue is the oceanic\r\n  depression. From the present distribution of plants and animals, we\r\n  infer that considerable tracts which are now submerged have formerly\r\n  been dry land--some of these changes having taken place in very\r\n  recent geological times. And the same conclusions are frequently\r\n  suggested by geological evidence. There can be little doubt that\r\n  Europe in Tertiary times extended further into the Northern Ocean\r\n  than it does now. And it is quite possible that in the Mesozoic and\r\n  Palæozoic eras considerable land-areas may likewise have appeared\r\n  here and there in those northern regions which are at present under\r\n  water. There is, indeed, hardly any portion of the continental\r\n  plateau which is now submerged that may not have been land at some\r\n  time or other. But after making all allowance for such possibilities,\r\n  the geological evidence, as far as it goes, nevertheless leads to\r\n  the conclusion that upon the whole a wider expense of primeval\r\n  continental plateau has come to the surface since Tertiary times than\r\n  was ever exposed during any former period of the world's history.\r\n\r\n  [Mr. Marcou states (_American Geologist_, 1890, p. 229) that the idea\r\n  of a gradual growth of land-areas originated with Elie de Beaumont,\r\n  who was in the habit of showing such maps, and used them in his\r\n  lectures at Paris as early as 1836. Professor Beudant published three\r\n  of these same maps for the Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary seas in\r\n  his _Cours élémentaire de Géologie_ (1841); and Professor Carl Vogt\r\n  in his _Lehrbuch der Geologie und Petrefactenkunde_ (1845), which\r\n  was confessedly based on Elie de Beaumont's lectures during 1844-46,\r\n  gives four maps of the Carboniferous, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and\r\n  Tertiary seas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Scientific Results of Dr. Nansen's Expedition.[DN]\r\n\r\n[DN] From _The Scottish Geographical Magazine_, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix to his most interesting and instructive work, _The\r\nFirst Crossing of Greenland_, Dr. Nansen treats of the scientific\r\nresults of his remarkable journey. The detailed enumeration of these\r\nresults, he tells us, would have been out of place in a general\r\naccount of his expedition, but will appear in due time elsewhere.\r\nHence he confines attention in his present work to such questions as\r\nare of most obvious interest, such as the extent, outward form, and\r\nelevation of the inland-ice of Greenland. By way of introduction his\r\nreaders are presented with some account of the geological history of\r\nthe country, which, although it contains nothing that was not already\r\nfamiliar to geologists, will doubtless prove interesting to others.\r\nAfter indicating that Greenland would appear to be composed almost\r\nexclusively of Archæan schists and granitoid eruptive rocks, the author\r\nglances at the evidence which the Mesozoic and Cainozoic strata of\r\nthe west coast have supplied as to the former prevalence of genial\r\nclimatic conditions. Heer is cited to show that during the formation\r\nof the Cretaceous beds the mean temperature of north Greenland was\r\nprobably between 70° and 72° F., while in later Cainozoic times it\r\ncould not have been less than 55° F., in 70° N.L. These conclusions\r\nare based on the character of the fossil floras. Now the mean annual\r\ntemperature on the west coast of Greenland, where the relics of these\r\nold floras occur, is about 15° F., from which it is inferred that there\r\nhas been a decrease of 40° since Cainozoic times. In those times,\r\nsays Dr. Nansen, \"the country must have rejoiced in a climate similar\r\nto that of Naples, while in the earlier Cretaceous period it must\r\nhave resembled that of Egypt.\" He then refers to the well-known fact\r\nthat, long after the deposition of the Cainozoic beds of Greenland,\r\nintensely arctic conditions supervened, when the inland-ice of that\r\ncountry extended much beyond its present limits. This was the Glacial\r\nperiod of geologists, during which all the northern regions of America\r\nand Europe, down to what are now temperate latitudes were likewise\r\nswathed in ice. Various hypotheses have been advanced in explanation of\r\nthese strange climatic vicissitudes, and some of them are very briefly\r\ndiscussed by Dr. Nansen. None of the suggested solutions of the problem\r\nquite satisfies him; but he appears to look with most favour on the\r\nview that great climatic revolutions in what are now polar regions\r\nmay have resulted from movements of the earth's axis. He admits,\r\nhowever, that there are certain strong objections to this hypothesis,\r\nand concludes that we have not yet got any satisfactory explanation\r\nto cover all the facts of the case. In discussing the question of a\r\npossible wandering of the pole, the author cites certain astronomical\r\nobservations to show that the position of the axis is even now slowly\r\nchanging, the movement amounting to half a second in six months. This\r\nis not much; but if the change, as he remarks, were to continue at the\r\nsame rate for 3600 years, the shift would amount to one degree. Thus\r\nin a period of no more than 72,000 to 108,000 years Greenland might be\r\nbrought into the latitude required for the growth of such floras as\r\nthose of Cainozoic and Mesozoic times. Geologists will readily concede\r\nthese or longer periods if they be required, but they will have graver\r\ndoubts than Dr. Nansen as to whether any such great changes in the\r\naxis are possible. The astronomical observations referred to, even if\r\nthey were fully confirmed, do not show that the movement is constant\r\nin one direction. They indicated, as he mentions, a slight increase\r\nof latitude during the first quarter of 1889, followed in the second\r\nquarter of the same year by a decrease, which continued to January,\r\n1890. Since the publication of Professor George Darwin's masterly paper\r\non the influence of geological changes on the earth's axis of rotation,\r\ngeologists have felt assured that the great climatic revolutions to\r\nwhich the stratified rocks bear witness must be otherwise explained\r\nthan by a wandering of the pole. Indeed, the geological evidence alone\r\nis enough to show that profound climatic changes have taken place\r\nwhile the pole has occupied its present position. Thus, there is no\r\nreasonable grounds for doubting that during the Glacial period the pole\r\nwas just where we find it to-day. For, under existing geographical\r\nconditions, could a sufficient lowering of temperature be brought\r\nabout, snow-fields and ice-sheets would gather and increase over\r\nthe very same areas as we know were glaciated in Pleistocene times.\r\nStill further, we have only to recall the fact that several extreme\r\nrevolutions of climate supervened during the so-called Glacial period,\r\nto see how impossible it is to account for the phenomena by movements\r\nof the earth's axis.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the great climatic changes of the Pleistocene\r\nperiod did not result from a wandering to and fro of the pole, then\r\nit is not at all likely that the Mesozoic and Cainozoic climates of\r\nGreenland were induced by any such movement. But does the geological\r\nevidence justify us in believing that the climates in Greenland\r\nduring Cretaceous and Tertiary times really resembled those of\r\nEgypt and southern Italy? It may be strongly doubted if it does.\r\nPalæontologists, like other mortals, find it hard to escape the\r\ninfluence of environment. They are apt to project the actual present\r\ninto the past, without, perhaps, fully considering how far they are\r\njustified in doing so. Because there occur in Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\nstrata, within Arctic regions, certain assemblages of plants which find\r\ntheir nearest representatives in southern Italy and Egypt, surely it is\r\nrather rash to conclude that Greenland has experienced climates like\r\nthose now characteristic of Mediterranean lands. All that the evidence\r\nreally entitles us to assume is simply that the _winter temperature_ of\r\nGreenland was formerly much higher than it is now. That great caution\r\nis required in comparing past with present climatological conditions\r\nmay be seen by glancing for a moment at the character of the flora\r\nwhich lived in Europe during the interglacial phase of the Pleistocene\r\nperiod. The plants of that period are for the most part living species,\r\nso that while dealing with these we are on safer ground than when we\r\nare treating of the floras of periods so far removed from us as those\r\nof Tertiary and Cretaceous times. Now, in the Pleistocene flora of\r\nEurope we find a strange commingling of species, such as we nowhere\r\nsee to-day over any equally wide area of the earth's surface. During\r\nPleistocene times many plants which are still indigenous to southern\r\nFrance flourished side by side in that area with species which are no\r\nlonger seen in the same region; some of these last having retreated\r\nbecause unable to support the cold of winter, while others have retired\r\nto the mountains to escape the dryness of the summer. Similar evidence\r\nis forthcoming from the Pleistocene accumulations of Italy, northern\r\nFrance, and Germany. In a word, clement winters and relatively cool and\r\nhumid summers permitted the wide diffusion and intimate association\r\nof plants which have now a very different distribution, temperate and\r\nsouthern species formerly flourishing together over vast areas of\r\nsouthern and central Europe. And similarly we find that during the same\r\nperiod the regions in question were tenanted by southern and temperate\r\nforms of animal life--elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses,\r\ntogether with cervine, bovine, and other forms, not a few of which are\r\nstill indigenous to our Continent--that ranged from the shores of the\r\nMediterranean up to our own latitudes. We cannot doubt, indeed, that\r\nthe present geographical distribution of plants and animals differs\r\nmarkedly from anything that has yet been disclosed by the researches\r\nof geologists. The climatic conditions of our day are exceptional as\r\ncompared with those of earlier times, and the occurrence in Greenland\r\nof southern types of plants, therefore, does not justify us in\r\nconcluding that climates like those of southern Italy and Egypt were\r\never characteristic of arctic regions. It is a low winter temperature\r\nrather than a want of great summer heat that restricts the range\r\nnorthward of southern floras. If Greenland could be divested of its\r\ninland-ice--if its winter temperature never fell below that of our own\r\nisland--it would doubtless become clothed in time with an abundant\r\ntemperate flora.\r\n\r\nJudging from what is known of the various floras and faunas that\r\nhave successively clothed and peopled the world, from Palæozoic down\r\nto the close of Cainozoic times, the general climatic conditions\r\nof the globe, prior to the Glacial period, would seem to have been\r\nprevalently insular rather than continental as they are now. The\r\nlands appear to have been formerly much less continuous, and ocean\r\ncurrents from southern latitudes had consequently freer access to high\r\nnorthern regions than is at present possible. In no other way can we\r\naccount for the facts connected with the geographical distribution\r\nand extent of the fossiliferous formations. But are we to infer, from\r\nthe occurrence of similar assemblages of marine organic remains in\r\narctic, temperate, and tropical latitudes, that the shores of primeval\r\nGreenland were washed by waters as warm as those of the tropics? Surely\r\nnot: an absence of very cold water in the far north is all that we\r\nseem justified in assuming. And so, in like manner, the presence in\r\nGreenland of fossil floras having the same general facies as those that\r\noccur in the corresponding strata of more southern latitudes, does\r\nnot compel us to believe that conditions at all similar to what are\r\nnow met with in warm-temperate and sub-tropical lands ever obtained\r\nin arctic regions. A relatively high winter temperature alone would\r\npermit the range northward of many tribes of plants which are now\r\nrestricted to southern latitudes. Yet, under the most uniform insular\r\nclimatic conditions that we can conceive of, there must always have\r\nbeen differences due to latitude--although such differences were never\r\napparently so marked as they are now.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the character of the climate which must have\r\nprevailed when the lands of the globe were much more interrupted\r\nand insular than at present, we have only to consider how greatly\r\nisothermal lines, even under existing continental conditions, are\r\ndeflected by ocean-currents. In the North Atlantic, for example, the\r\nwinter isotherm of 32° F. is deflected northward from the parallel\r\nof New York to that of Hammerfest--a displacement of at least 30° of\r\nlatitude. The Arctic Sea now occupies a partially closed basin, into\r\nwhich only one considerable current enters from the south. But in\r\nearlier ages the case was otherwise, and there was often communication\r\nacross what are now our continental areas. Instead of being girdled,\r\nas at present, by an almost continuous land-mass, the Arctic Sea seems\r\nto have formed with the circumjacent ocean one great archipelago. Thus\r\nfreely open to the influx of southern currents, it is not difficult to\r\nbelieve that the seas of the far north might never be frozen, and that\r\nan \"inland-ice\" like that of Greenland would be impossible. The present\r\ncold summers of that country, as the late Dr. Croll has insisted,\r\nare due not so much to high latitude as to the presence of snow and\r\nice. Could these be removed, the summers would be as warm at least as\r\nthose of England. Now the occurrence in arctic regions of Palæozoic\r\nand Mesozoic marine faunas is strongly suggestive of the former\r\npresence there of genial waters having free communication with lower\r\nlatitudes; and it is to the presence of these warm currents, flowing\r\nuninterruptedly through polar regions, that we would attribute the high\r\nwinter temperature and uniform climate to which the fossil floras and\r\nfaunas of Greenland bear testimony.\r\n\r\nIf these views be at all reasonable, it seems unnecessary to call to\r\nour aid hypothetical changes in the position of the earth's axis. It\r\nmay be admitted, however, that the climate of the Arctic regions must\r\nhave been from time to time more or less affected by those cosmical\r\ncauses to which Croll has appealed. So long, however, as insular\r\nconditions prevailed, the changes induced by a great increase in the\r\neccentricity of the earth's orbit would not necessarily be strongly\r\nmarked. Dr. Nansen objects to Croll's well-known theory that \"it cannot\r\naccount for the recurrence of conditions so favourable as to explain\r\nthe existence in Greenland of a climate comparable to what we now find\r\nin tropical regions.\" No doubt it cannot, but, as we maintain, there\r\nis no good reason for supposing that tropical or sub-tropical climates\r\never characterised any area within the Arctic Circle. The remarkable\r\nassociation in Europe, during so recent a period as the Pleistocene,\r\nof southern and temperate species of plants and animals, ought to warn\r\nus against taking the present distribution of life-forms as an exact\r\ntype of the kind of distribution which characterised earlier ages. It\r\nis safe to say that were our present continental areas to become broken\r\nup into groups of larger and smaller islands, so as to allow of a much\r\nless impeded oceanic circulation, the resulting climatic conditions\r\nwould offer the strongest contrast to the present. And as the lands\r\nof the globe were apparently in former times more insular than they\r\nare now, it is hazardous to compare the climates of the present with\r\nthose of the past. It is reasonable to infer, from the occurrence in\r\nGreenland of fossil floras which find their nearest representatives in\r\nsouthern Europe and north Africa, that the winters of the far north\r\nwere formerly mild and clement. But we cannot conclude, from the same\r\nevidence, that the Arctic summers were ever as hot as those of our\r\npresent warm-temperate and sub-tropical zones.\r\n\r\nBut if the recent expedition has thrown no new light on the disputed\r\nquestion as to the cause of the high temperature which formerly\r\nprevailed in Greenland, it is needless to say that it has added\r\nconsiderably to our knowledge of the present physical conditions of\r\nthat country. The view held by many that Greenland must be wrapped in\r\nice has been amply justified, and we can now no longer doubt that the\r\ninland-ice covers the whole country from the 75th parallel southwards.\r\nA section of Greenland in the latitude at which it was crossed by\r\nNansen and his comrades \"gives an almost exact mathematical curve,\r\napproximating very closely to the arc of a circle described with a\r\nradius of about 6500 miles. The whole way across the surface coincides\r\ntolerably accurately with this arc, though it falls away somewhat\r\nabruptly at the coasts, and a little more abruptly on the east side\r\nthan the west.\" Taking the observations of other Arctic travellers\r\nwith his own, Nansen is led to the conclusion that \"the surface of the\r\ninland-ice forms part of a remarkably regular cylinder, the radius\r\nof which nevertheless varies not a little at different latitudes,\r\nincreasing markedly from the south, and consequently making the arc of\r\nthe surface flatter and flatter as it advances northwards.\" He points\r\nout that this remarkable configuration must to a certain extent be\r\nindependent of the form of the underlying land-surface, which, to judge\r\nfrom the character of the wild and mountainous coast-lands, probably\r\nresembles Norway in its general configuration--if, indeed it be not a\r\ngroup of mountainous islands. The buried interior of Greenland must\r\nin fact be a region of high mountains and deep valleys, all of which\r\nhave totally disappeared under the enveloping _mer de glace_. It is\r\nobvious, as Dr. Nansen remarks, that the minor irregularities of the\r\nland \"have had no influence whatever upon the form of the upper surface\r\nof the ice-sheet.\" That surface-form has simply been determined by\r\nthe force of pressure--the quasi-viscous mass attaining its maximum\r\nthickness towards the central line of the country, where resistance to\r\nthe movement due to pressure must necessarily have been greatest. Thus\r\nalthough the larger features of the ice-drowned land may have had some\r\ninfluence in determining the position of the ice-shed, it is not by\r\nany means certain that this central line coincides with the dominant\r\nridge or watershed of the land itself. For, as Nansen reminds us, the\r\nice-shed of the Scandinavian inland-ice of glacial times certainly lay\r\nabout 100 miles to the east of the main water-parting of Norway and\r\nSweden. Similar facts, we may add, have been noticed in connection with\r\nthe old ice-sheets of Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe greatest elevation attained by the expedition was 9000 feet. How\r\ndeeply buried the dominating parts of the land-surface may be at that\r\nelevation one cannot tell. It is obvious, however, that the _mer de\r\nglace_ must be very unequal in thickness. According to Dr. Nansen the\r\naverage elevation of the valleys in the interior cannot much exceed\r\n2300 or 3300 feet, so that the ice lying above such depressions must\r\nhave a thickness of 5700 to 6700 feet. It cannot, of course, lie so\r\ndeeply over mountain-ridges. The eroding power of such a glacier-mass\r\nmust be enormous, and Dr. Nansen does not doubt that the buried valleys\r\nof Greenland are being widened and deepened by the grinding of the\r\ngreat ice-streams that are ever advancing towards the sea.\r\n\r\nThe expedition met with no streams of surface-water on the inland-ice;\r\nindeed, the amount of superficial melting in the interior was quite\r\ninsignificant. And yet, as is well known, many considerable streams\r\nand rivers flow out from underneath the inland-ice all the year\r\nround. It is obvious, therefore, that this water-supply does not come\r\nfrom superficial sources, as, according to Dr. Nansen, it is usually\r\nsupposed to do. But surely it has long been recognised that such rivers\r\nas the Mary Minturn must be derived from sub-glacial melting. And the\r\nvarious causes to which our author attributes this melting have already\r\nfrequently been pointed out. Earth-heat--the influence of pressure in\r\nlowering the melting-point of ice--and the friction induced by the\r\nmovement of the ice itself have all long ago been recognised as factors\r\ntending to produce the sub-glacial water-drainage of an ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nDr. Nansen's speculations on the origin of the \"drumlins\" and \"kames\"\r\nof formerly glaciated areas will interest geologists, but are not so\r\nnovel as he supposes. His description of what are known as \"drumlins\"\r\nis not quite correct. These long lenticular banks cannot be said\r\nto lie upon boulder-clay, but are merely a structural form of that\r\naccumulation. And it is hardly the case that geologists have \"performed\r\nthe most acrobatic feats\" in trying to explain the origin of the\r\nbanks in question. The usual explanation is that they have been formed\r\nunderneath the ice as ground-moraine--the upper surface of which\r\nvaries in configuration--being sometimes approximately even, as in\r\nbroad mountain-valleys; at other times ridged and corrugated, as in\r\nopen lowlands. And these modifications of surface are supposed to\r\nhave resulted from the varying movement and pressure of the overlying\r\nice-sheet. The drumlins, in fact, would appear to be analogous to the\r\nbanks that accumulate in the beds of rivers. Many drumlins, indeed,\r\nare composed partly of solid rock and partly of boulder-clay, which\r\nwould seem to have accumulated in the lee of the projecting rock, much\r\nin the same way as gravel and sand gather behind any large boulder\r\nin a stream-course. Dr. Nansen, apparently, to some extent confounds\r\ndrumlins with \"kames\" and \"åsar,\" of which certainly many strange and\r\nconflicting explanations have been hazarded. These, however, differ\r\nessentially from drumlins, for they consist exclusively, or almost\r\nexclusively, of water-worn and more or less water-assorted materials.\r\nAnd one widely-accepted view of their origin is that they have\r\naccumulated in tunnels underneath an ice-sheet. This is practically\r\nthe same view as Dr. Nansen's. He thinks that when an ice-sheet has\r\nits under-surface furrowed by running water, the ground-moraine will\r\ntend to be pressed up into the river-channels. The water will, in this\r\nway, be compelled to hollow out the roof of its tunnel to a greater\r\ndegree, and as the stream continues to work upwards the moraine will\r\nfollow it, so as to partially fill the tunnel and form a ridge along\r\nthe back of which the sub-glacial stream will run. The material forming\r\nthe upper portion of the ridge will thus come to be composed mainly\r\nof water-worn and stratified detritus, derived from the erosion of\r\nthe ground-moraine. This is an ingenious suggestion which may be of\r\ngood service in some cases, but it is certainly inapplicable to most\r\nkames and åsar. If it were a complete explanation we ought to find\r\nthese ridges consisting of an upper water-assorted portion and a lower\r\nunmodified morainic portion (boulder-clay). But this is not the case,\r\nfor most kames consist entirely, from top to bottom, of water-assorted\r\nmaterials. They are found running across an even or gently-undulating\r\nsurface of boulder-clay, and sometimes they rest not on boulder-clay\r\nbut solid rock.\r\n\r\nDr. Nansen considers another geological question which has given rise\r\nto much controversy, and is still far from being settled--namely,\r\nwhether the oscillations of level which have left such conspicuous\r\ntraces in northern regions are in any way connected with the appearance\r\nand disappearance of great ice-sheets. Can a big ice-sheet push down\r\nthe earth's crust by its weight? and does the crust rise again as the\r\nice melts away? Could a thick ice-sheet exercise sufficient attraction\r\nupon the sea to cause it to rise upon the land, and thus explain the\r\norigin of some of the so-called raised beaches of this and other\r\nformerly glaciated lands? Can the weight of a great ice-sheet shift\r\nthe earth's centre of gravity, and, if so, to what extent? Each of\r\nthese questions has been answered in the affirmative and the negative\r\nby controversialists, and, until the geological evidence has been\r\ncompletely sifted, each, doubtless, will continue to be alternately\r\naffirmed and denied. All that need be pointed out here is that some of\r\nthe movements which occurred during the Pleistocene period were on much\r\ntoo large a scale to be explicable by any of the hypotheses referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Geographical Development of Coast-lines.[DO]\r\n\r\n[DO] Presidential Address to the Geographical Section of the British\r\nAssociation, Edinburgh, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the many questions upon which of late years light has been\r\nthrown by deep-sea exploration and geological research, not the least\r\ninteresting is that of the geographical development of coast-lines. How\r\nis the existing distribution of land and water to be accounted for? Are\r\nthe revolutions in the relative position of land and sea, to which the\r\ngeological record bears witness, due to movements of the earth's crust\r\nor of the hydrosphere? Why are coast-lines in some regions extremely\r\nregular, while elsewhere they are much indented? About 150 years ago\r\nthe prevalent belief was that ancient sea-margins indicated a formerly\r\nhigher ocean-level. Such was the view held by Celsius, who, from an\r\nexamination of the coast-lands of Sweden, attributed the retreat of\r\nthe sea to a gradual drying up of the latter. But this desiccation\r\nhypothesis was not accepted by Playfair, who thought it much more\r\nlikely that the land had risen. It was not, however, until after Von\r\nBuch had visited Sweden (1806-1808), and published the results of his\r\nobservations, that Playfair's suggestion received much consideration.\r\nVon Buch concluded that the apparent retreat of the sea was not due\r\nto a general depression of the ocean-level, but to elevation of the\r\nland--a conclusion which subsequently obtained the strong support of\r\nLyell. The authority of these celebrated men gained for the elevation\r\ntheory more or less complete assent, and for many years it has been the\r\northodox belief of geologists that the ancient sea-margins of Sweden\r\nand other lands have resulted from vertical movements of the crust.\r\nIt has long been admitted, however, that highly-flexed and disturbed\r\nstrata require some other explanation. Obviously such structures are\r\nthe result of lateral compression and crumpling. Hence geologists have\r\nmaintained that the mysterious subterranean forces have affected the\r\ncrust in different ways. Mountain-ranges, they conceive, are ridged up\r\nby tangential thrusts and compression, while vast continental areas\r\nslowly rise and fall, with little or no disturbance of the strata. From\r\nthis point of view it is the lithosphere that is unstable, all changes\r\nin the relative level of land and sea being due to crustal movements.\r\nOf late years, however, Trautschold and others have begun to doubt\r\nwhether this theory is wholly true, and to maintain that the sea-level\r\nmay have changed without reference to movements of the lithosphere.\r\nThus Hilber has suggested that sinking of the sea-level may be due, in\r\npart at least, to absorption, while Schmick believes that the apparent\r\nelevation and depression of continental areas are really the results\r\nof grand secular movements of the ocean. The sea, according to him,\r\nperiodically attains a high level in each hemisphere alternately, the\r\nwaters being at present heaped up in the southern hemisphere. Professor\r\nSuess, again, believing that in equatorial regions the sea is, on the\r\nwhole, gaining on the land, while in other latitudes the reverse would\r\nappear to be the case, points out this is in harmony with his view\r\nof a periodical flux and reflux of the ocean between the equator and\r\nthe poles. He thinks we have no evidence of any vertical elevation\r\naffecting wide areas, and that the only movements of elevation that\r\ntake place are those by which mountains are upheaved. The broad\r\ninvasions and transgressions of the continental areas by the sea, which\r\nwe know have occurred again and again, are attributed by him to secular\r\nmovements of the hydrosphere itself.\r\n\r\nApart from all hypothesis and theory, we learn that the surface of\r\nthe sea is not exactly spheroidal. It reaches a higher level on the\r\nborders of the continents than in mid-ocean, and it varies likewise\r\nin height at different places on the same coast. The attraction of\r\nthe Himalaya, for example, suffices to cause a difference of 300\r\nfeet between the level of the sea at the delta of the Indus and on\r\nthe coast of Ceylon. The recognition of such facts has led Penck to\r\nsuggest that the submergence of the maritime regions of north-west\r\nEurope and the opposite coasts of North America, which took place\r\nat a recent geological date, and from which the lands in question\r\nhave only partially recovered, may have been brought about by the\r\nattraction exerted by the vast ice-sheets of the Glacial period.\r\nBut, as Drygalski, Woodward, and others have shown, the heights at\r\nwhich recent marine deposits occur in the regions referred to are\r\nmuch too great to be accounted for by any possible distortion of the\r\nhydrosphere. The late James Croll had previously endeavoured to show\r\nthat the accumulation of ice over northern lands during glacial times\r\nwould suffice to displace the earth's centre of gravity, and thus cause\r\nthe sea to rise upon the glaciated tracts. More recently other views\r\nhave been advanced to explain the apparently causal connection between\r\nglaciation and submergence, but these need not be considered here.\r\n\r\nWhatever degree of importance may attach to the various hypotheses of\r\nsecular movements of the sea, it is obvious that the general trends\r\nof the world's coast-lines are determined in the first place by the\r\nposition of the dominant wrinkles of the lithosphere. Even if we\r\nconcede that all \"raised beaches,\" so-called, are not necessarily\r\nthe result of earth-movements, and that the frequent transgressions\r\nof the continental areas by oceanic waters in geological times may\r\npossibly have been due to independent movements of the sea, still we\r\nmust admit that the solid crust of the globe has always been subject to\r\ndistortion. And this being so, we cannot doubt that the general trends\r\nof the world's coast-lines must have been modified from time to time\r\nby movements of the lithosphere.\r\n\r\nAs geographers we are not immediately concerned with the mode of origin\r\nof those vast wrinkles, nor need we speculate on the causes which may\r\nhave determined their direction. It seems, however, to be the general\r\nopinion that the configuration of the lithosphere is due simply to the\r\nsinking-in and doubling-up of the crust on the cooling and contracting\r\nnucleus. But it must be admitted that neither physicists nor geologists\r\nare prepared with a satisfactory hypothesis to account for the\r\nprominent trends of the great world-ridges and troughs. According to\r\nthe late Professor Alexander Winchell, these trends may have been\r\nthe result of primitive tidal action. He was of opinion that the\r\ntransmeridional progress of the tidal swell in early incrustive times\r\non our planet would give the forming crust structural characteristics\r\nand aptitudes trending from north to south. The earliest wrinkles to\r\ncome into existence, therefore, would be meridional or submeridional,\r\nand such, certainly, is the prevalent direction of the most conspicuous\r\nearth-features. There are many terrestrial trends, however, as\r\nProfessor Winchell knew, which do not conform to the requirements of\r\nhis hypothesis; but such transmeridional features, he thought, could\r\ngenerally be shown to be of later origin than the others. This is\r\nthe only speculation, so far as I know, which attempts, perhaps not\r\naltogether unsuccessfully, to explain the origin of the main trends\r\nof terrestrial features. According to other authorities, however, the\r\narea of the earth's crust occupied by the ocean is denser than that\r\nover which the continental regions are spread. The depressed denser\r\npart balances the lighter elevated portion. But why these regions\r\nof different densities should be so distributed no one has yet told\r\nus. Neither does Le Conte's view, that the continental areas and the\r\noceanic depressions owe their origin to unequal radial contraction of\r\nthe earth in its secular cooling, help us to understand why the larger\r\nfeatures of the globe should be disposed as they are.\r\n\r\nGeographers must for the present be content to take the world as\r\nthey find it. What we do know is that our lands are distributed\r\nover the surface of a great continental plateau of irregular form,\r\nthe bounding slopes of which plunge down more or less steeply into\r\na vast oceanic depression. So far as geological research has gone,\r\nthere is reason to believe that these elevated and depressed areas\r\nare of primeval antiquity--that they ante-date the very oldest of\r\nthe sedimentary formations. There is abundant evidence, however, to\r\nshow that the relatively elevated or continental area has been again\r\nand again irregularly submerged under tolerably deep and wide seas.\r\nBut all historical geology seems to assure us that the continental\r\nplateau and the oceanic hollows have never changed places, although\r\nfrom time to time portions of the latter have been ridged up and added\r\nto the margins of the former, while ever and anon marginal portions\r\nof the plateau have sunk to very considerable depths. We may thus\r\nspeak of the great world-ridges as regions of dominant elevation, and\r\nof the profound oceanic troughs as areas of more or less persistent\r\ndepression. From one point of view, it is true, no part of the earth's\r\nsurface can be looked upon as a region of dominant elevation. Our\r\nglobe is a cooling and contracting body, and depression must always\r\nbe the prevailing movement of the lithosphere. The elevation of the\r\ncontinental plateau is thus only relative. Could we conceive the crust\r\nthroughout the deeper portions of the oceanic depression to subside to\r\nstill greater depths, while at the same time the continental plateau\r\nremained stationary, or subsided more slowly, the sea would necessarily\r\nretreat from the land, and the latter would then appear to rise. It is\r\nimprobable, however, that any extensive subsidence of the crust under\r\nthe ocean could take place without accompanying disturbance of the\r\ncontinental plateau; and in this case the latter might experience in\r\nplaces not only negative but positive elevation. During the evolution\r\nof our continents, crustal movements have again and again disturbed the\r\nrelative level of land and sea; but since the general result has been\r\nto increase the land-surface and to contract the area occupied by the\r\nsea, it is convenient to speak of the former as the region of dominant\r\nelevation, and of the latter as that of prevalent depression. Properly\r\nspeaking, both are sinking regions, the rate of subsidence within the\r\noceanic trough being in excess of that experienced over the continental\r\nplateau. The question of the geographical development of coast-lines is\r\ntherefore only that of the dry lands themselves.\r\n\r\nThe greater land-masses are all situated upon, but are nowhere\r\nco-extensive with, the area of dominant elevation, for very\r\nconsiderable portions of the continental plateau are still covered by\r\nthe sea. Opinions may differ as to which fathoms-line we should take as\r\nmarking approximately the boundary between that region and the oceanic\r\ndepression; and it is obvious, indeed, that any line selected must be\r\narbitrary and more or less misleading, for it is quite certain that\r\nthe true boundary of the continental plateau cannot lie parallel to\r\nthe surface of the ocean. In some regions it approaches within a few\r\nhundreds of fathoms of the sea-level; in other places it sinks for\r\nconsiderably more than 1000 fathoms below that level. Thus, while a\r\nvery moderate elevation would in certain latitudes cause the land to\r\nextend to the edge of the plateau, an elevation of at least 10,000 feet\r\nwould be required in some other places to bring about a similar result.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that the land-surface is nowhere co-extensive with\r\nthe great plateau, yet the existing coast-lines may be said to trend\r\nin the same general direction as its margins. So abruptly does the\r\ncontinental plateau rise from the oceanic trough, that a depression\r\nof the sea-level, or an elevation of the plateau, for 10,000 feet,\r\nwould add only a narrow belt to the Pacific coast between Alaska and\r\nCape Horn, while the gain of land on the Atlantic slope of America\r\nbetween 30° N.L. and 40° S.L. would not be much greater. In the higher\r\nlatitudes of the northern hemisphere, however, very considerable\r\ngeographical changes would be accomplished by a much less amount of\r\nelevation of the plateau. Were the continental plateau to be upheaved\r\nfor 3000 feet, the major portion of the Arctic Sea would become land.\r\nThus, in general terms, we may say that the coast-lines of arctic and\r\ntemperate North America and Eurasia are further withdrawn from the edge\r\nof the continental plateau than those of lower latitudes.\r\n\r\nIn regions where existing coast-lines approach the margin of the\r\nplateau, they are apt to run for long distances in one determinate\r\ndirection, and, whether the coastal area be high or not, to show a\r\ngentle sinuosity. Their course is seldom interrupted by bold projecting\r\nheadlands or peninsulas, or by intruding inlets, while fringing or\r\nmarginal islands rarely occur. To these appearances the northern\r\nregions, as every one knows, offer the strongest contrast. Not only do\r\nthey trend irregularly, but their continuity is constantly interrupted\r\nby promontories and peninsulas, by inlets and fiords, while fringing\r\nislands abound. But an elevation of some 400 or 500 fathoms only\r\nwould revolutionise the geography of those regions, and confer upon\r\nthe northern coast-lines of the world the regularity which at present\r\ncharacterises those of western Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the coast-lines of such lands as Africa\r\nowe their regularity primarily to their approximate coincidence with\r\nthe steep boundary-slopes of the continental plateau, while the\r\nirregularities characteristic of the coast-line of north-western Europe\r\nand the corresponding latitudes of North America are determined by the\r\nsuperficial configuration of the same plateau, which in those regions\r\nis relatively more depressed. I have spoken of the general contrast\r\nbetween high and low northern latitudes; but it is needless to say\r\nthat in southern regions the coast-lines exhibit similar contrasts.\r\nThe regular coast-lines of Africa and South America have already been\r\nreferred to; but we cannot fail to recognise in the much-indented\r\nsea-board and the numerous coastal islands of southern Chile a complete\r\nanalogy to the fiord regions of high northern latitudes. Both are areas\r\nof comparatively recent depression. Again, the manifold irregularities\r\nof the coasts of south-eastern Asia, and the multitudes of islands\r\nthat serve to link that continent to Australia and New Zealand, are all\r\nevidence that the surface of the continental plateau in those regions\r\nis extensively invaded by the sea.\r\n\r\nA word or two now as to the configuration of the oceanic trough. There\r\ncan be no doubt that this differs very considerably from that of the\r\nland-surface. It is, upon the whole, flat or gently-undulating. Here\r\nand there it swells gently upwards into broad elevated banks, some of\r\nwhich have been traced for great distances. In other places narrower\r\nridges and abrupt mountain-like elevations diversify its surface,\r\nand project again and again above the level of the sea, to form the\r\nnumerous islets of Oceania. Once more, the sounding-line has made us\r\nacquainted with the notable fact that numerous deep depressions--some\r\nlong and narrow, others relatively short and broad--stud the floor\r\nof the great trough. I shall have occasion to refer again to these\r\nremarkable depressions, and need at present only call attention to\r\nthe fact that they are especially well-developed in the region of\r\nthe western Pacific, where the floor of the sea, at the base of the\r\nbounding slopes of the continental plateau, sinks in places to depths\r\nof three and even of five miles below the existing coast-lines. One may\r\nfurther note the fact that the deepest areas of the Atlantic are met\r\nwith in like manner close to the walls of the plateau--a long ridge,\r\nwhich rises midway between the continents and runs in the same general\r\ndirection as their coast-lines, serving to divide the trough of the\r\nAtlantic into two parallel hollows.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to our coast-lines and the question of their\r\ndevelopment, it is obvious that their general trends have been\r\ndetermined by crustal movements. Their regularity is in direct\r\nproportion to the closeness of their approach to the margin of the\r\ncontinental plateau. The more nearly they coincide with the edge of\r\nthat plateau, the fewer irregularities do they present; the further\r\nthey recede from it, the more highly are they indented. Various\r\nother factors, it is true, have played a more or less important part\r\nin their development, but their dominant trends were undoubtedly\r\ndetermined at a very early period in the world's history--their\r\ndetermination necessarily dates back, in short, to the time when the\r\ngreat world-ridges and oceanic troughs came into existence. So far as\r\nwe can read the story told by the rocks, however, it would seem that\r\nin the earliest ages of which geology can speak with any confidence,\r\nthe coast-lines of the world must have been infinitely more irregular\r\nthan now. In Palæozoic times, relatively small areas of the continental\r\nplateau appeared above the level of the sea. Insular conditions\r\neverywhere prevailed. But as ages rolled on, wider and wider tracts of\r\nthe plateau were exposed, and this notwithstanding many oscillations of\r\nlevel. So that one may say there has been, upon the whole, a general\r\nadvance from insular to continental conditions. In other words, the\r\nsea has continued to retreat from the surface of the continental\r\nplateau. To account for this change, we must suppose that depression\r\nof the crust has been in excess within the oceanic area, and that now\r\nand again positive elevation of the continental plateau has taken\r\nplace, more especially along its margins. That movements of elevation,\r\npositive or negative, have again and again affected our land-areas can\r\nbe demonstrated, and it seems highly probable, therefore, that similar\r\nmovements may have been experienced within the oceanic trough.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of crustal movement, as we have seen, are recognised by\r\ngeologists. Sometimes the crust appears to rise, or, as the case may\r\nbe, to sink over wide regions, without much disturbance or tilting\r\nof strata, although these are now and again more or less extensively\r\nfractured and displaced. It may conduce to clearness if we speak of\r\nthese movements as regional. The other kind of crustal disturbance\r\ntakes place more markedly in linear directions, and is always\r\naccompanied by abrupt folding and mashing together of strata, along\r\nwith more or less fracturing and displacement. The plateau of the\r\nColorado has often been cited as a good example of regional elevation,\r\nwhere we have a wide area of approximately horizontal strata apparently\r\nuplifted without much rock-disturbance, while the Alps or any other\r\nchain of highly-flexed and convoluted strata will serve as an example\r\nof what we may term axial or linear uplifts. It must be understood\r\nthat both regional and axial movements result from the same cause--the\r\nadjustment of the solid crust to the contracting nucleus--and that the\r\nterm _elevation_, therefore, is only relative. Sometimes the sinking\r\ncrust gets relief from the enormous lateral pressure to which it is\r\nsubjected by crumpling up along lines of weakness, and then mountains\r\nof elevation are formed; at other times, the pressure is relieved by\r\nthe formation of broader swellings, when wide areas become uplifted\r\nrelatively to surrounding regions. Geologists, however, are beginning\r\nto doubt whether upheaval of the latter kind can affect a broad\r\ncontinental area. Probably, in most cases, the apparent elevation of\r\ncontinental regions is only negative. The land appears to have risen\r\nbecause the floor of the oceanic basin has become depressed. Even the\r\nsmaller plateau-like elevations which occur within some continental\r\nregions may in a similar way owe their dominance to the sinking of\r\ncontiguous regions.\r\n\r\nIn the geographical development of our land, movements of elevation\r\nand depression have played an important part. But we cannot ignore the\r\nwork done by other agents of change. If the orographical features of\r\nthe land everywhere attest the potency of plutonic agents, they no less\r\nforcibly assure us that the inequalities of surface resulting from such\r\nmovements are universally modified by denudation and sedimentation.\r\nElevated plains and mountains are gradually demolished, and the hollows\r\nand depressions of the great continental plateau become slowly filled\r\nwith their detritus. Thus inland-seas tend to vanish, inlets and\r\nestuaries are silted up, and the land in places advances seaward. The\r\nenergies of the sea, again, come in to aid those of rain and rivers,\r\nso that under the combined action of all the superficial agents of\r\nchange, the irregularities of coast-lines become reduced, and, were no\r\ncrustal movement to intervene, would eventually disappear. The work\r\naccomplished by those agents upon a coast-line is most conspicuous in\r\nregions where the surface of the continental plateau is occupied by\r\ncomparatively shallow seas. Here full play is given to sedimentation\r\nand marine erosion, while the latter alone comes into prominence upon\r\nshores that are washed by deeper waters. When the coast-lines advance\r\nto the edge of the continental plateau, they naturally trend, as we\r\nhave seen, for great distances in some particular direction. Should\r\nthey preserve that position, undisturbed by crustal oscillation, for a\r\nprolonged period of time, they will eventually be cut back by the sea.\r\nIn this way a shelf or terrace will be formed, narrow in some places,\r\nbroader in others, according to the resistance offered by the varying\r\ncharacter of the rocks. But no long inlets or fiords can result from\r\nsuch action. At most the harder and less readily demolished rocks will\r\nform headlands, while shallow bays will be scooped out of the more\r\nyielding masses. In short, between the narrower and broader parts\r\nof the eroded shelf or terrace a certain proportion will tend to be\r\npreserved. As the shelf is widened, sedimentation will become more and\r\nmore effective, and in places may come to protect the land from further\r\nmarine erosion. This action is especially conspicuous in tropical and\r\nsub-tropical regions, which are characterised by well-marked rainy\r\nseasons. In such regions immense quantities of sediment are washed down\r\nfrom the land to the sea, and tend to accumulate along shore, forming\r\nlow alluvial flats. All long-established coast-lines thus acquire a\r\ncharacteristically sinuous form, and perhaps no better examples could\r\nbe cited than those of western Africa.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, we may say that the chief agents concerned in the\r\ndevelopment of coast-lines are crustal movements, sedimentation, and\r\nmarine erosion. All the main trends are the result of elevation and\r\ndepression. Considerable geographical changes, however, have been\r\nbrought about by the silting up of those shallow and sheltered seas\r\nwhich, in certain regions, overflow wide areas of the continental\r\nplateau. Throughout all the ages, indeed, epigene agents have striven\r\nto reduce the superficial inequalities of that plateau, by levelling\r\nheights and filling up depressions, and thus, as it were, flattening\r\nout the land-surface and causing it to extend. The erosive action\r\nof the sea, from our present point of view, is of comparatively\r\nlittle importance. It merely adds a few finishing touches to the work\r\nperformed by the other agents of change.\r\n\r\nA glance at the geographical evolution of our own Continent will render\r\nthis sufficiently evident. Viewed in detail, the structure of Europe\r\nis exceedingly complicated, but there are certain leading features in\r\nits architecture which no profound analysis is required to detect. We\r\nnote, in the first place, that highly-disturbed rocks of Archæan and\r\nPalæozoic age reach their greatest development along the north-western\r\nand western borders of our Continent, as in Scandinavia, the British\r\nIslands, north-west France, and the Iberian peninsula. Another belt\r\nof similarly disturbed strata of like age traverses central Europe\r\nfrom west to east, and is seen in the south of Ireland, Cornwall,\r\nnorth-west France, the Ardennes, the Thüringer-Wald, the Erz Gebirge,\r\nthe Riesen Gebirge, the Böhmer-Wald, and other heights of middle and\r\nsouthern Germany. Strata of Mesozoic and Cainozoic age rest upon the\r\nolder systems in such a way as to show that the latter had been much\r\nfolded, fractured, and denuded before they came to be covered with\r\nyounger formations. North and north-east of the central belt of ancient\r\nrocks just referred to, the sedimentary strata that extend to the\r\nshores of the Baltic and over a vast region in Russia, range in age\r\nfrom Palæozoic down to Cainozoic times, and are disposed for the most\r\npart in gentle undulations--they are either approximately horizontal\r\nor slightly inclined. Unlike the disturbed rocks of the maritime\r\nregions and of central Europe, they have obviously been subjected to\r\ncomparatively little folding since the time of their deposition. To\r\nthe south of the primitive back-bone of central Europe succeeds a\r\nregion composed superficially of Mesozoic and Cainozoic strata for the\r\nmost part, which, along with underlying Palæozoic and Archæan rocks,\r\nare often highly-flexed and ridged up, as in the chains of the Jura,\r\nthe Alps, the Carpathians, etc. One may say, in general terms, that\r\nthroughout the whole Mediterranean area Archæan and Palæozoic rocks\r\nappear at the surface only when they form the nuclei of mountains of\r\nelevation, into the composition of which rocks of younger age largely\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nFrom this bald and meagre outline of the general geological structure\r\nof Europe, we may gather that the leading orographical features of our\r\nContinent began to be developed at a very early period. Unquestionably\r\nthe oldest land-areas are represented by the disturbed Archæan\r\nand Palæozoic rocks of the Atlantic sea-board and central Europe.\r\nExamination of those tracts shows that they have experienced excessive\r\ndenudation. The Archæan and Palæozoic masses, distributed along the\r\nmargin of the Atlantic, are the mere wrecks of what, in earlier ages,\r\nmust have been lofty regions, the mountain-chains of which may well\r\nhave rivalled or even exceeded in height the Alps of to-day. They,\r\ntogether with the old disturbed rocks of central Europe, formed for a\r\nlong time the only land in our area. Between the ancient Scandinavian\r\ntract in the north and a narrow interrupted belt in central Europe,\r\nstretched a shallow sea, which covered all the regions that now form\r\nour Great Plain; while immediately south of the central belt lay the\r\nwide depression of the Mediterranean--for as yet the Pyrenees, the\r\nAlps, and the Carpathians were not. Both the Mediterranean and the\r\nRusso-Germanic sea communicated with the Atlantic. As time went on land\r\ncontinued to be developed along the same lines, a result due partly\r\nto crustal movements, partly to sedimentation. Thus the relatively\r\nshallow Russo-Germanic sea became silted up, while the Mediterranean\r\nshore-line advanced southwards. It is interesting to note that the\r\nlatter sea, down to the close of Tertiary times, seems always to have\r\ncommunicated freely with the Atlantic, and to have been relatively\r\ndeep. The Russo-Germanic sea, on the contrary, while now and again\r\nopening widely into the Atlantic, and attaining considerable depths in\r\nits western reaches, remained on the whole shallow, and ever and anon\r\nvanished from wide areas to contract into a series of inland-seas and\r\nlarge salt lakes.\r\n\r\nReduced to its simplest elements, therefore, the structure of Europe\r\nshows two primitive ridges--one extending with some interruptions\r\nalong the Atlantic sea-board, the other traversing central Europe\r\nfrom west to east, and separating the area of the Great Plain from\r\nthe Mediterranean basin. The excessive denudation which the more\r\nancient lands have undergone, and the great uplifts of Mesozoic and of\r\nCainozoic times, together with the comparatively recent submergence\r\nof broad tracts in the north and north-west, have not succeeded in\r\nobscuring the dominant features in the architecture of our Continent.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to trace, as rapidly as I can, the geographical\r\ndevelopment of the coast-lines of the Atlantic as a whole, and to\r\npoint out the chief contrasts between them and the coast-lines of the\r\nPacific. The extreme irregularity of the Arctic and Atlantic shores of\r\nEurope at once suggests to a geologist a partially-drowned land, the\r\nsuperficial inequalities of which are accountable for the vagaries of\r\nthe coast-lines. The fiords of Norway and Scotland occupy what were\r\nat no distant date land-valleys, and the numerous marginal islands of\r\nthose regions are merely the projecting portions of a recently-sunken\r\narea. The continental plateau extends up to and a little beyond the\r\none hundred fathoms line, and there are many indications that the\r\nland formerly reached as far. Thus the sunken area is traversed by\r\nvalley-like depressions, which widen as they pass outwards to the\r\nedge of the plateau, and have all the appearance of being hollows\r\nof sub-aërial erosion. I have already mentioned the fact that the\r\nScandinavian uplands and the Scottish Highlands are the relics of what\r\nwere at one time true mountains of elevation, corresponding in the mode\r\nof their formation to those of Switzerland, and, like these, attaining\r\na great elevation. During subsequent stages of Palæozoic time, that\r\nhighly-elevated region was subjected to long-continued and profound\r\nerosion--the mountain-country was planed down over wide regions to\r\nsea-level, and broad stretches of the reduced land-surface became\r\nsubmerged. Younger Palæozoic formations then accumulated upon the\r\ndrowned land, until eventually renewed crustal disturbance supervened,\r\nand the marginal areas of the continental plateau again appeared as\r\ndry land, but not, as before, in the form of mountains of elevation.\r\nLofty table-lands now took the place of abrupt and serrated ranges\r\nand chains--table-lands which, in their turn, were destined in the\r\ncourse of long ages to be deeply sculptured and furrowed by sub-aërial\r\nagents. During this process the European coast-line would seem to\r\nhave coincided more or less closely with the edge of the continental\r\nplateau. Finally, after many subsequent movements of the crust in\r\nthese latitudes, the land became partially submerged--a condition from\r\nwhich north-western and northern Europe would appear in recent times\r\nto be slowly recovering. Thus the highly-indented coast-line of those\r\nregions does not coincide with the edge of the plateau, but with those\r\nirregularities of its upper surface which are the result of antecedent\r\nsub-aërial erosion.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the Russo-Germanic plain and the Mediterranean\r\nas representing original depressions in the continental plateau, and\r\nof the high-grounds that extend between them as regions of dominant\r\nelevation, which, throughout all the manifold revolutions of the past,\r\nwould appear to have persisted as a more or less well-marked boundary,\r\nseparating the northern from the southern basin. During certain periods\r\nit was no doubt in some degree submerged, but never apparently to\r\nthe same extent as the depressed areas it served to separate. From\r\ntime to time uplifts continued to take place along this central belt,\r\nwhich thus increased in breadth, the younger formations, which were\r\naccumulated along the margins of the two basins, being successively\r\nridged up against nuclei of older rocks. The latest great crustal\r\nmovements in our Continent, resulting in the uplift of the Alps and\r\nother east and west ranges of similar age, have still further widened\r\nthat ancient belt of dominant elevation which in our day forms the most\r\nmarked orographical feature of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Germanic basin is now for the most part land, the Baltic\r\nand the North Sea representing its still submerged portions. This\r\nbasin, as already remarked, was probably never so deep as that of the\r\nMediterranean. We gather as much from the fact that, while mechanical\r\nsediments of comparatively shallow-water origin predominate in the\r\nformer area, limestones are the characteristic features of the\r\nsouthern region. Its relative shallowness helps us to understand why\r\nthe northern depression should have been silted up more completely\r\nthan the Mediterranean. We must remember also that for long ages it\r\nreceived the drainage of a much more extensive land-surface than the\r\nlatter--the land that sloped towards the Mediterranean in Palæozoic\r\nand Mesozoic times being of relatively little importance. Thus the\r\ncrustal movements which ever and anon depressed the Russo-Germanic area\r\nwere, in the long-run, counterbalanced by sedimentation. The uplift\r\nof the Alps, the Atlas, and other east and west ranges, has greatly\r\ncontracted the area of the Mediterranean, and sedimentation has also\r\nacted in the same direction, but it is highly probable that that sea\r\nis now as deep as, or even deeper than, it has ever been. It occupies\r\na primitive depression in which the rate of subsidence has exceeded\r\nthat of sedimentation. In many respects, indeed, this remarkable\r\ntransmeridional hollow--continued eastward in the Red Sea, the Black\r\nSea, and the Aralo-Caspian depression--is analogous, as we shall see,\r\nto the great oceanic trough itself.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier geological periods linear or axial uplifts and\r\nvolcanic action again and again marked the growth of land on the\r\nAtlantic sea-board. But after Palæozoic times, no great mountains of\r\nelevation came into existence in that region, while volcanic action\r\nalmost ceased. In Tertiary times, it is true, there was a remarkable\r\nrecrudescence of volcanic activity, but the massive eruptions of\r\nAntrim and western Scotland, of the Faröe Islands and Iceland, must\r\nbe considered apart from the general geology of our Continent. From\r\nMesozoic times onwards it was along the borders of the Mediterranean\r\ndepression that great mountain uplifts and volcanoes chiefly presented\r\nthemselves; and as the land-surface extended southwards from central\r\nEurope, and the area of the Mediterranean was contracted, volcanic\r\naction followed the advancing shore-lines. The occurrence of numerous\r\nextinct and of still existing volcanoes along the borders of this\r\ninland-sea, the evidence of recent crustal movements so commonly\r\nmet with upon its margins, the great irregularities of its depths,\r\nthe proximity of vast axial uplifts of late geological age, and the\r\nfrequency of earthquake phenomena, all indicate instability, and remind\r\nus strongly of similarly constructed and disturbed regions within the\r\narea of the vast Pacific.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the Arctic and Atlantic coast-lines of North\r\nAmerica. From the extreme north down to the latitude of New York the\r\nshores are obviously those of a partially-submerged region. They are\r\nof the same type as the coasts of north-western Europe. We have every\r\nreason to believe also that the depression of Greenland and north-east\r\nAmerica, from which these lands have only partially recovered,\r\ndates back to a comparatively recent period. The fiords and inlets,\r\nlike those of Europe, are merely half-drowned land-valleys, and the\r\ncontinental shelf is crossed by deep hollows which are evidently\r\nonly the seaward continuations of well-marked terrestrial features.\r\nSuch, for example, is the case with the valleys of the Hudson and\r\nthe St. Lawrence, the submerged portions of which can be followed\r\nout to the edge of the continental plateau, which is notched by them\r\nat depths of 474 and 622 fathoms respectively. There is, in short, a\r\nbroad resemblance between the coasts of the entire Arctic and North\r\nAtlantic regions down to the latitudes already mentioned. Everywhere\r\nthey are irregular and fringed with islands in less or greater\r\nabundance--highly-denuded and deeply-incised plateaux being penetrated\r\nby fiords, while low-lying and undulating lands that shelve gently\r\nseaward are invaded by shallow bays and inlets. Comparing the American\r\nwith the opposite European coasts one cannot help being struck with\r\ncertain other resemblances. Thus Hudson Bay at once suggests the\r\nBaltic, and the Gulf of Mexico, with the Caribbean Sea, recalls the\r\nMediterranean. But the geological structure of the coast-lands of\r\nGreenland and North America betrays a much closer resemblance between\r\nthese and the opposite shores of Europe than appears on a glance at\r\nthe map. There is something more than a mere superficial similarity.\r\nIn eastern North America and Greenland, just as in western Europe,\r\nno grand mountain uplifts have taken place for a prodigious time.\r\nThe latest great upheavals, which were accompanied by much folding\r\nand flexing of strata, are those of the Appalachian chain and of\r\nthe coastal ranges extending through New England, Nova Scotia, and\r\nNewfoundland, all of which are of Palæozoic age. Considerable crustal\r\nmovements affected the American coast-lines in Mesozoic times, and\r\nduring these uplifts the strata suffered fracture and displacement,\r\nbut were subjected to comparatively little folding. Again, along\r\nthe maritime borders of north-east America, as in the corresponding\r\ncoast-lines of Europe, igneous action, more or less abundant in\r\nPalæozoic and early Mesozoic times, has since been quiescent. From\r\nthe mouth of the Hudson to the Straits of Florida the coast-lines are\r\ncomposed of Tertiary and Quaternary deposits. This shows that the land\r\nhas continued down to recent times to gain upon the sea--a result\r\nbrought about partly by quiet crustal movements, but to a large extent\r\nby sedimentation, aided, on the coasts of Florida, by the action of\r\nreef-building corals.\r\n\r\nAlthough volcanic action has long ceased on the American sea-board,\r\nwe note that in Greenland, as in the west of Scotland and north\r\nof Ireland, there is abundant evidence of volcanic activity at\r\nso late a period as the Tertiary. It would appear that the great\r\nplateau-basalts of those regions, and of Iceland and the Faröe Islands,\r\nwere contemporaneous, and were possibly connected with an important\r\ncrustal movement. It has long been suggested that at a very early\r\ngeological period Europe and North America may have been united. The\r\ngreat thickness attained by the Palæozoic rocks in the eastern areas\r\nof the latter implies the existence of a wide land-surface from which\r\nancient sediments were derived. That old land must have extended\r\nbeyond the existing coast-line, but how far we cannot tell. Similarly\r\nin north-west Europe, during early Palæozoic times, the land probably\r\nstretched further into the Atlantic than at present. But whether,\r\nas some think, an actual land-connection subsisted between the two\r\ncontinents it is impossible to say. Some such connection was formerly\r\nsupposed necessary to account for life common to the Palæozoic strata\r\nof both continents, and which, as they were probably denizens of\r\ncomparatively shallow water, could only have crossed from one area\r\nto another along a shore-line. It is obvious, indeed, that if the\r\noceanic troughs in those early days were of an abysmal character, a\r\nbelt of shallow water would be required to explain the geographical\r\ndistribution of cosmopolitan marine life-forms. But if it be true that\r\nsubsidence of the crust has been going on through all geological time,\r\nand that the land-areas have nothwithstanding continued to extend over\r\nthe continental plateau, then it follows that the oceanic trough must\r\nbe deeper now than it was in Palæozoic times. There are, moreover,\r\ncertain geological facts which seem hardly explicable on the assumption\r\nthat the seas of past ages attained abysmal depths over any extensive\r\nareas. The Palæozoic strata which enter so largely into the framework\r\nof our lands have much the same appearance all the world over, and\r\nwere accumulated for the most part in comparatively shallow water.\r\nA petrographical description of the Palæozoic mechanical sediments\r\nof Europe would serve almost equally well for those of America, of\r\nAsia, or of Australia. Take in connection with this the fact that\r\nPalæozoic faunas had a very much wider range than those of Mesozoic and\r\nlater ages, and were characterised above all by the presence of many\r\ncosmopolitan species, and we can hardly resist the conclusion that it\r\nwas the comparative shallowness of the ancient seas that favoured that\r\nwide dispersal of species, and enabled currents to distribute sediments\r\nthe same in kind over such vast regions. As the oceanic area deepened\r\nand contracted, and the land-surface increased, marine faunas were\r\ngradually restricted in their range, and the cosmopolitan marine forms\r\ndiminished in numbers, while sediments, gathering in separate regions,\r\nbecame more and more differentiated. For these and other reasons which\r\nneed not be entered upon here, I see no necessity for supposing that a\r\nPalæozoic Atlantis connected Europe with North America. The broad ridge\r\nupon which the Faröe Islands and Iceland are founded seems to pertain\r\nas truly to the oceanic depression as the long Dolphin Ridge of the\r\nSouth Atlantic. The trend of the continental plateau in high latitudes\r\nis shown, as I think, by the general direction of the coast-lines of\r\nnorth-western Europe and east Greenland, the continental shelf being\r\nsubmerged in those regions for a few hundred fathoms only. How the\r\nIcelandic ridge came into existence, and what its age may be, we can\r\nonly conjecture. It may be a wrinkle as old as the oceanic trough\r\nwhich it traverses, or its origin may date back to a much more recent\r\nperiod. We may conceive it to be an area which has subsided more slowly\r\nthan the floor of the ocean to the north and south; or, on the other\r\nhand, it may be a belt of positive elevation. Perhaps the latter is\r\nthe more probable supposition, for it seems very unlikely that crustal\r\ndisturbances, resulting in axial and regional uplifts, should have been\r\nconfined to the continental plateau only. Be that as it may, there is\r\nlittle doubt that land-connection did obtain between Greenland and\r\nEurope in the Cainozoic times along this Icelandic ridge, for relics\r\nof the same Tertiary flora are found in Scotland, the Faröe Islands,\r\nIceland, and Greenland. The deposits in which these plant-remains\r\noccur are associated with great sheets of volcanic rocks, which in\r\nthe Faröe Islands and Iceland reach a thickness of many thousand feet.\r\nOf the same age are the massive basalts of Jan Mayen, Spitzbergen,\r\nFranz-Joseph Land, and Greenland. These lavas seem seldom to have\r\nissued from isolated foci in the manner of modern eruptions, but rather\r\nto have welled up along the lines of rectilineal fissures. From the\r\nanalogy of similar phenomena in other parts of the world it might be\r\ninferred that the volcanic action of these northern regions may have\r\nbeen connected with a movement of elevation, and that the Icelandic\r\nridge, if it did not come into existence during the Tertiary period,\r\nwas at all events greatly upheaved at that time. It would seem most\r\nlikely, in short, that the volcanic action in question was connected\r\nmainly with crustal movements in the oceanic trough. Similar phenomena,\r\nas is well known, are met with further south in the trough of the\r\nAtlantic. Thus the volcanic Azores rise like Iceland from the surface\r\nof a broad ridge which is separated from the continental plateau by\r\nwide and deep depressions. And so again, from the back of the great\r\nDolphin Ridge, spring the volcanic islets of St. Paul's, Ascension, and\r\nTristan d'Acunha.\r\n\r\nI have treated of the Icelandic bank at some length for the purpose of\r\nshowing that its volcanic phenomena do not really form an exception to\r\nthe rule that such eruptions ceased after Palæozoic or early Mesozoic\r\ntimes to disturb the Atlantic coast-lines of Europe and North America.\r\nAs the bank in question extends between Greenland and the British\r\nIslands, it was only natural that both those regions should be affected\r\nby its movements. But its history pertains essentially to that of the\r\nAtlantic trough; and it seems to show us how transmeridional movements\r\nof the crust, accompanied by vast discharges of igneous rock, may come\r\nin time to form land-connections between what are now widely-separated\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nLet us next turn our attention to the coast-lines of the Gulf of\r\nMexico and the Caribbean Sea. These enclosed seas have frequently been\r\ncompared to the Mediterranean, and the resemblance is self-evident.\r\nIndeed, it is so close that one may say the Mexican-Caribbean Sea\r\nand the Mediterranean are rather homologous than simply analogous.\r\nThe latter, as we have seen, occupies a primitive depression, and\r\nformerly covered a much wider area. It extended at one time over\r\nmuch of southern Europe and northern Africa, and appears to have\r\nhad full communication across Asia Minor with the Indian Ocean, and\r\nwith the Arctic Ocean athwart the low-lying tracts of north-western\r\nAsia. Similarly, it would seem, the Mexican-Caribbean Sea is the\r\nremaining portion of an ancient inland-sea which formerly stretched\r\nnorth through the heart of North America to the Arctic Ocean. Like\r\nits European parallel, it has been diminished by sedimentation and\r\ncrustal movements. It resembles the latter also in the greatness and\r\nirregularity of its depths, and in the evidence which its islands\r\nsupply of volcanic action as well as of very considerable crustal\r\nmovements within recent geological times. Along the whole northern\r\nborders of the Gulf of Mexico the coast-lands, like those on the\r\nAtlantic sea-board of the Southern States, are composed of Tertiary\r\nand recent accumulations, and the same is the case with Yucatan;\r\nwhile similar young formations are met with on the borders of the\r\nCaribbean Sea and in the Antilles. The Bahamas and the Windward\r\nIslands mark out for us the margin of the continental plateau, which\r\nhere falls away abruptly to profound depths. One feels assured that\r\nthis portion of the plateau has been ridged up to its present level\r\nat no distant geological date. But notwithstanding all the evidence\r\nof recent extensive crustal movements in this region, it is obvious\r\nthat the Mexican-Caribbean depression, however much it may have been\r\nsubsequently modified, is of primitive origin.[DP]\r\n\r\n[DP] Professor Suess thinks it is probable that the Caribbean Sea and\r\nthe Mediterranean are portions of one and the same primitive depression\r\nwhich traversed the Atlantic area in early Cretaceous times. He further\r\nsuggests that it may have been through the gradual widening of the\r\ncentral Mediterranean that the Atlantic in later times came into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the coast-lands of North America, I would again point\r\nout their leading geological features. In a word, then, they are\r\ncomposed for the most part of Archæan and Palæozoic rocks; no great\r\nlinear or axial uplifts marked by much flexure of strata have taken\r\nplace in those regions since Palæozoic times; while igneous action\r\nvirtually ceased about the close of the Palæozoic or the commencement\r\nof the Mesozoic period. It is not before we reach the shores of the\r\nSouthern States and the coast-lands of the Mexican-Caribbean Sea that\r\nwe encounter notable accumulations of Mesozoic, Tertiary, and younger\r\nage. These occur in approximately horizontal positions round the Gulf\r\nof Mexico; but in the Sierra Nevada of northern Colombia and the\r\nCordilleras of Venezuela the Tertiary strata enter into the formation\r\nof true mountains of elevation. Thus the Mexican-Caribbean depression,\r\nlike that of the Mediterranean, is characterised not only by its\r\nirregular depths and its volcanic phenomena, but by the propinquity\r\nof recent mountains of upheaval, which bear the same relation to the\r\nCaribbean Sea as the mountains of north Africa do to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWe may now compare the Atlantic coasts of South America with those\r\nof Africa. The former coincide in general direction with the edge\r\nof the continental plateau, to which they closely approach between\r\nCape St. Roque and Cape Frio. In the north-east, between Cape Paria,\r\nopposite Trinidad, and Cape St. Roque, the continental shelf attains\r\na considerably greater breadth, while south of Cape Frio it gradually\r\nwidens until, in the extreme south, it runs out towards the east in the\r\nform of a narrow ridge, upon the top of which rise the Falkland Islands\r\nand south Georgia. Excluding from consideration for the present all\r\nrecent alluvial and Tertiary deposits, we may say that the coast-lands\r\nfrom Venezuela down to the south of Brazil are composed principally\r\nof Archæan rocks; the eastern borders of the continent further south\r\nbeing formed of Quaternary and Tertiary accumulations. So far as we\r\nknow, igneous rocks are of rare occurrence on the Atlantic sea-board.\r\nPalæozoic strata approach the coast-lands at various points between\r\nthe mouths of the Amazons and La Plata, and these, with the underlying\r\nand surrounding Archæan rocks, are more or less folded and disturbed,\r\nwhile the younger strata of Mesozoic and Cainozoic age (occupying\r\nwide regions in the basin of the Amazons, and here and there fringing\r\nthe sea-coast) occur in approximately horizontal positions. It would\r\nappear, therefore, that no great axial uplifts have taken place in\r\nthose regions since Palæozoic times. The crustal movements of later\r\nages were regional rather than axial; the younger rocks are not flexed\r\nand mashed together, and their elevation (negative or positive) does\r\nnot seem to have been accompanied by conspicuous volcanic action.\r\n\r\nThe varying width of the continental shelf is due to several causes.\r\nThe Orinoco, the Amazons, and other rivers descending to the north-east\r\ncoast, carry enormous quantities of sediment, much of which comes to\r\nrest on the submerged slopes of the continental plateau, so that the\r\ncontinental shelf tends to extend seawards. The same process takes\r\nplace on the south-east coast, where the Rio de la Plata discharges\r\nits muddy waters. South of latitude 40° S., however, another cause\r\nhas come into play. From the mouth of the Rio Negro to the terminal\r\npoint of the continent the whole character of the coast betokens a\r\ngeologically recent emergence, accompanied and followed by considerable\r\nmarine erosion. So that in this region the continental shelf increases\r\nin width by the retreat of the coast-line, while in the north-east it\r\ngains by advancing seawards. It is to be noted, however, that even\r\nthere, in places where the shores are formed of alluvia, the sea tends\r\nto encroach upon the land.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic coast of Africa resembles that of South America in certain\r\nrespects, but it also offers some important contrasts. As the northern\r\ncoasts of Venezuela and Colombia must be considered in relation rather\r\nto the Caribbean depression than to the Atlantic, so the African\r\nsea-board between Cape Spartel and Cape Nun pertains structurally\r\nto the Mediterranean region. From the southern limits of Morocco to\r\nCape Colony the coastal heights are composed chiefly of Archæan and\r\nPalæozoic rocks, the low shore-lands showing here and there strata of\r\nMesozoic and Tertiary age together with still more recent deposits.\r\nThe existing coast-lines everywhere advance close to the edge of\r\nthe continental plateau, so that the submarine shelf is relatively\r\nnarrower than that of eastern South America. The African coast is still\r\nfurther distinguished from that of South America by the presence of\r\nseveral groups of volcanic islands--Fernando Po and others in the Gulf\r\nof Guinea, and Cape Verde and Canary Islands. The last-named group,\r\nhowever, notwithstanding its geographical position, is probably related\r\nrather to the Mediterranean depression than to the Atlantic trough.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of the African coast-lands shows that the\r\nearliest to come into existence were those that extend between Cape\r\nNun and the Cape of Good Hope. The coastal ranges of that section are\r\nmuch denuded, for they are of very great antiquity, having been ridged\r\nup in Palæozoic times. The later uplifts (negative or positive) of\r\nthe same region were not attended by tilting and folding of strata,\r\nfor the Mesozoic and Tertiary deposits, like those of South America,\r\nlie in comparatively horizontal positions. Between Cape Nun and Cape\r\nSpartel the rocks of the maritime tracts range in age from Palæozoic to\r\nCainozoic, and have been traced across Morocco into Algeria and Tunis.\r\nThey all belong to the Mediterranean region, and were deposited at a\r\ntime when the southern shores of that inland sea extended from a point\r\nopposite the Canary Islands along what is now the southern margin of\r\nMorocco, Algeria, and Tunis. Towards the close of the Tertiary period\r\nthe final upheaval of the Atlas took place, and the Mediterranean,\r\nretreating northwards, became an almost land-locked sea.\r\n\r\nI need hardly stop to point out how the African coast-lines have been\r\nmodified by marine erosion and the accumulation of sediment upon the\r\ncontinental shelf. The extreme regularity of the coasts is due partly\r\nto the fact that the land is nearly co-extensive with the continental\r\nplateau, but it also results in large measure from the extreme\r\nantiquity of the land itself. This has allowed of the cutting-back of\r\nheadlands and the rilling up of bays and inlets, a process which has\r\nbeen going on between Morocco and Cape Colony with probably little\r\ninterruption for a very prolonged period of time. We may note also the\r\neffect of the heavy rains of the equatorial region in washing down\r\ndetritus to the shores, and in this way protecting the land to some\r\nextent from the erosive action of the sea.\r\n\r\nWhat now, let us ask, are the outstanding features of the coast-lines\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean? We have seen that along the margins of each of\r\nthe bordering continents the last series of great mountain-uplifts\r\ntook place in Palæozoic times. This is true alike for North and South\r\nAmerica, for Europe and Africa. Later movements which have added to the\r\nextent of land were not marked by the extreme folding of strata which\r\nattended the early upheavals. The Mesozoic and Cainozoic rocks, which\r\nnow and again form the shore-lands, occur in more or less undisturbed\r\ncondition. The only great linear uplifts or true mountains of elevation\r\nwhich have come into existence in western Europe and northern Africa\r\nsince the Palæozoic period trend approximately at right angles to the\r\ndirection of the Atlantic trough, and are obviously related to the\r\nprimitive depression of the Mediterranean. The Pyrenees and the Atlas,\r\ntherefore, although their latest elevation took place in Tertiary\r\ntimes, form no exceptions to the rule that the extreme flexing and\r\nfolding of strata which is so conspicuous a feature in the geological\r\nstructure of the Atlantic sea-board dates back to the Palæozoic era.\r\nAnd the same holds true of North and South America. There all the\r\ncoastal ranges of highly flexed and folded strata are of Palæozoic\r\nage. The Cordilleras of Venezuela are no doubt a Tertiary uplift, but\r\nthey are as obviously related to the Caribbean depression as the Atlas\r\nranges are to that of the Mediterranean. Again, we note that volcanic\r\nactivity along the borders of the Atlantic was much less pronounced\r\nduring the Mesozoic period than it appears to have been in the earlier\r\nages. Indeed, if we except the great Tertiary basalt-flows of the\r\nIcelandic ridge and the Arctic regions, we may say that volcanic action\r\nalmost ceased after the Palæozoic era to manifest itself upon the\r\nAtlantic coast-lands of North America and Europe. But while volcanic\r\naction has died out upon the Atlantic margins of both continents, it\r\nhas continued during a prolonged geological period within the area of\r\nthe Mediterranean depression. And in like manner the corresponding\r\ndepression between North and South America has been the scene of\r\nvolcanic disturbances from Mesozoic down to recent times. Along the\r\nAfrican coasts the only displays of recent volcanic action that\r\nappertain to the continental margin are those of the Gulf of Guinea\r\nand the Cape de Verde Islands. The Canary Islands and Madeira may come\r\nunder the same category, but, as we have seen, they appear to stand in\r\nrelationship to the Mediterranean depression and the Tertiary uplift\r\nof North Africa. Of Iceland and the Azores I have already spoken, and\r\nof Ascension and the other volcanic islets of the South Atlantic it is\r\nneedless to say that they are related to wrinkles in the trough of the\r\nocean, and therefore have no immediate connection with the continental\r\nplateau.\r\n\r\nThus in the geographical development of the Atlantic coast-lines we may\r\nnote the following stages:--_First_, in Palæozoic times the formation\r\nof great mountain-uplifts, frequently accompanied by volcanic action.\r\n_Second_, a prolonged stage of comparative coastal tranquillity, during\r\nwhich the maritime ranges referred to were subject to such excessive\r\nerosion that they were planed down to low levels, and in certain areas\r\neven submerged. _Third_, renewed elevation (negative or positive)\r\nwhereby considerable portions of the much-denuded Archæan and Palæozoic\r\nrocks, now largely covered by younger deposits, were converted into\r\nhigh-lands. During this stage not much rock-folding took place, nor\r\nwere any true mountains of elevation formed parallel to the Atlantic\r\nmargins. It was otherwise, however, in the Mediterranean and Caribbean\r\ndepressions, where coastal movements resulted in the formation of\r\nenormous linear uplifts. Moreover, volcanic action is now and has for\r\na long time been more characteristic of these depressions than of the\r\nAtlantic coast-lands.\r\n\r\nI must now ask you to take a comprehensive glance at the coast-lines of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. In some important respects these offer a striking\r\ncontrast to those we have been considering. Time will not allow me\r\nto enter into detailed description, and I must therefore confine\r\nattention to certain salient features. Examining first the shores\r\nof the Americas, we find that there are two well-marked regions of\r\nfiords and fringing islands--namely, the coasts of Alaska and British\r\nColumbia, and of South America from 40° S.L. to Cape Horn. Although\r\nthese regions may be now extending seawards in places, it is obvious\r\nthat they have recently been subject to submergence. When the fiords of\r\nAlaska and British Columbia existed as land-valleys it is probable that\r\na broad land-connection obtained between North America and Asia. The\r\nwhole Pacific coast is margined by mountain-ranges, which in elevation\r\nand boldness far exceed those of the Atlantic sea-board. The rocks\r\nentering into their formation range in age from Archæan and Palæozoic\r\ndown to Cainozoic, and they are almost everywhere highly disturbed and\r\nflexed. It is not necessary, even if it were possible, to consider the\r\ngeological history of all those uplifted masses. It is enough for my\r\npurpose to note the fact that the coastal ranges of North America and\r\nthe principal chain of the Andes were all elevated in Tertiary times.\r\nIt may be remarked further that, from the Mesozoic period down to the\r\npresent, the Pacific borders of America have been the scene of volcanic\r\nactivity far in excess of what has been experienced on the Atlantic\r\nsea-board.\r\n\r\nGeographically the Asiatic coasts of the Pacific offer a strong\r\ncontrast to those of the American borders. The latter, as we have\r\nseen, are for the most part not far removed from the edge of the\r\ncontinental plateau. The coasts of the mainland of Asia, on the other\r\nhand, retire to a great distance, the true margin of the plateau being\r\nmarked out by that great chain of islands which extends from Kamchatka\r\nsouth to the Philippines and New Guinea. The seas lying between those\r\nislands and the mainland occupy depressions in the continental plateau.\r\nWere that plateau to be lifted up for 6000 or 7000 feet the seas\r\nreferred to would be enclosed by continuous land, and all the principal\r\nislands of the East Indian Archipelago--Sumatra, Java, Celebes, and New\r\nGuinea, would become united to themselves as well as to Australia and\r\nNew Zealand. In short, it is the relatively depressed condition of the\r\ncontinental plateau along the western borders of the Pacific basin that\r\ncauses the Asiatic coast-lines to differ so strikingly from those of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nFrom a geological point of view the differences are less striking than\r\nthe resemblances. It is true that we have as yet a very imperfect\r\nknowledge of the geological structure of eastern Asia, but we know\r\nenough to justify the conclusion that in its main features that region\r\ndoes not differ essentially from western North America. During Mesozoic\r\nand Cainozoic times the sea appears to have overflowed vast tracts of\r\nManchooria and China, and even to have penetrated into what is now the\r\ngreat Desert of Gobi. Subsequent crustal movements revolutionised the\r\ngeography of all those regions. Great ranges of linear uplifts came\r\ninto existence, and in these the younger formations, together with\r\nthe foundations on which they rested, were squeezed into folds and\r\nridged up against the nuclei of Palæozoic and Archæan rocks which had\r\nhitherto formed the only dry land. The latest of these grand upheavals\r\nare of Tertiary age, and, like those of the Pacific slope of America,\r\nthey were accompanied by excessive volcanic action. The long chains of\r\nislands that flank the shores of Asia we must look upon as a series of\r\npartially submerged or partially emerged mountain-ranges, analogous\r\ngeographically to the coast-ranges of North and Central America, and\r\nto the youngest Cordilleras of South America. The presence of numerous\r\nactive and recently extinct volcanoes, taken in connection with the\r\noccurrence of many great depressions which furrow the floor of the sea\r\nin the East Indian Archipelago, and the profound depths attained by the\r\nPacific trough along the borders of Japan and the Kurile and Aleutian\r\nIslands--all indicate conditions of very considerable instability of\r\nthe lithosphere. We are not surprised, therefore, to meet with much\r\napparently conflicting evidence of elevation and depression in the\r\ncoast-lands of eastern Asia, where in some places the sea would seem\r\nto be encroaching, while in other regions it is retreating. In all\r\nearthquake-ridden and volcanic areas such irregular coastal changes\r\nmay be looked for. So extreme are the irregularities of the sea-floor\r\nin the area lying between Australia, the Solomon Islands, the New\r\nHebrides, and New Zealand, and so great are the depths attained by\r\nmany of the depressions, that the margins of the continental plateau\r\nare harder to trace here than anywhere else in the world. The bottom\r\nof the oceanic trough throughout a large portion of the southern and\r\nwestern Pacific is, in fact, traversed by many great mountain-ridges,\r\nthe summits of which approach the surface again and again to form the\r\nnumerous islets of Polynesia. But notwithstanding the considerable\r\ndepths that separate Australia from New Zealand there is geological\r\nevidence to show that a land-connection formerly linked both to Asia.\r\nThe continental plateau, therefore, must be held to include New\r\nCaledonia and New Zealand. Hence the volcanic islets of the Solomon and\r\nNew Hebrides groups are related to Australia in the same way as the\r\nLiu-kiu, Japanese, and Kurile Islands are to Asia.\r\n\r\nHaving rapidly sketched the more prominent features of the Pacific\r\ncoast-lines, we are in a position to realise the remarkable contrast\r\nthey present to the coast-lines of the Atlantic. The highly-folded\r\nstrata of the Atlantic sea-board are the relics of great mountains of\r\nupheaval, the origin of which cannot be assigned to a more recent date\r\nthan Palæozoic times. During subsequent crustal movements no mountains\r\nof corrugated strata were uplifted along the Atlantic margins, the\r\nMesozoic and Cainozoic strata of the coastal regions showing little\r\nor no disturbance. It is quite in keeping with all this that volcanic\r\naction appears to have been most strongly manifested in Palæozoic\r\ntimes. So many long ages have passed since the upheaval of the Archæan\r\nand Palæozoic mountains of the Atlantic sea-board that these heights\r\nhave everywhere lost the character of true mountains of elevation.\r\nPlaned down to low levels, partially submerged and covered to some\r\nextent by newer formations, they have in many places been again\r\nconverted into dry lands, forming plateaux--now sorely denuded and\r\ncut up into mountains and valleys of erosion. Why the later movements\r\nalong the borders of the Atlantic basin should not have resulted in\r\nthe wholesale plication of the younger sedimentary rocks is a question\r\nfor geologists. It would seem as if the Atlantic margins had reached a\r\nstage of comparative stability long before the grand Tertiary uplifts\r\nof the Pacific borders had taken place; for, as we have seen, the\r\nMesozoic and the Cainozoic strata of the Atlantic coast-lands show\r\nlittle or no trace of having been subjected to tangential thrusting\r\nand crushing. Hence one cannot help suspecting that the retreat of\r\nthe sea during Mesozoic and Cainozoic ages may have been due rather\r\nto subsidence of the oceanic trough and to sedimentation within the\r\ncontinental area than to positive elevation of the land.\r\n\r\nOver the Pacific trough, likewise, depression has probably been in\r\nprogress more or less continuously since Palæozoic times, and this\r\nmovement alone must have tended to withdraw the sea from the surface\r\nof the continental plateau in Asia and America. But by far the most\r\nimportant coastal changes in those regions have been brought about\r\nby the crumpling-up of the plateau, and the formation of gigantic\r\nmountains of upheaval along its margins. From remotest geological\r\nperiods down almost to the present, the land-area has been increased\r\nfrom time to time by the doubling-up and consequent elevation of\r\ncoastal accumulations, and by the eruption of vast masses of volcanic\r\nmaterials. It is this long-continued activity of the plutonic forces\r\nwithin the Pacific area which has caused the coast-lands of that basin\r\nto contrast so strongly with those of the Atlantic. The latter are\r\nincomparably older than the former--the heights of the Atlantic borders\r\nbeing mountains of denudation of vast geological antiquity, while the\r\ncoastal ranges of the Pacific slope are creations but of yesterday as\r\nit were. It may well be that those Cordilleras and mountain-chains\r\nreach a greater height than was ever attained by any Palæozoic uplifts\r\nof the Atlantic borders. But the marked disparity in elevation between\r\nthe coast-lands of the Pacific and the Atlantic is due chiefly to a\r\nprofound difference in age. Had the Pacific coast-lands existed for as\r\nlong a period and suffered as much erosion as the ancient rocks of the\r\nAtlantic sea-board, they would now have little elevation to boast of.\r\n\r\nThe coast-lines of the Indian Ocean are not, upon the whole, far\r\nremoved from the margin of the continental plateau. The elevation of\r\nEast Africa for 6000 feet would add only a narrow belt to the land.\r\nThis would still leave Madagascar an island, but there are geological\r\nreasons for concluding that this island was at a far distant period\r\nunited to Africa, and it must therefore be considered as forming\r\na portion of the continental plateau. The great depths which now\r\nseparate it from the mainland are probably due to local subsidence,\r\nconnected with volcanic action in Madagascar itself and in the Comoro\r\nIslands. The southern coasts of Asia, like those of East Africa,\r\napproach the edge of the continental plateau, so that an elevation\r\nof 6000 feet would make little addition to the land-area. With the\r\nsame amount of upheaval, however, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java,\r\nand West Australia would become united, but without extending much\r\nfurther seawards. Land-connection, as we know, existed in Mesozoic\r\ntimes between Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, but the coast-lines\r\nof that distant period must have differed considerably from those\r\nthat would appear were the regions in question to experience now a\r\ngeneral elevation. The Archæan and the Palæozoic rocks of the Malay\r\nPeninsula and Sumatra are flanked on the side of the Indian Ocean\r\nby great volcanic ridges, and by uplifts of Tertiary strata, which\r\ncontinue along the line of the Nicobar and the Andaman Islands into\r\nBurma. Thus the coast-lines of that section of the Indian Ocean exhibit\r\na geographical development similar to that of the Pacific sea-board.\r\nElsewhere, as in Hindustan, Arabia, and East Africa, the coast-lines\r\nappear to have been determined chiefly by regional elevations of the\r\nland or subsidence of the oceanic trough in Mesozoic and Cainozoic\r\ntimes, accompanied by the out-welling of enormous floods of lava.\r\nSeeing, then, that the Pacific and the Indian Oceans are pre-eminently\r\nregions which, down to a recent date, have been subject to great\r\ncrustal movements and to excessive volcanic action, we may infer\r\nthat in the development of their coast-lines the sea played a very\r\nsubordinate part. The shores, indeed, are largely protected from marine\r\nerosion by partially emerged volcanic ridges and by coral islands\r\nand reefs, and to a considerable extent also by the sediment which\r\nin tropical regions especially is swept down to the coast in great\r\nabundance by rains and rivers. Moreover, as the geological structure of\r\nthese regions assures us, the land would appear seldom to have remained\r\nsufficiently long at one level to permit of much destruction by waves\r\nand tidal currents.\r\n\r\nIn fine, then, we arrive at the general conclusion that the coast-lines\r\nof the globe are of very unequal age. Those of the Atlantic were\r\ndetermined as far back as Palæozoic times by great mountain-up lifts\r\nalong the margin of the continental plateau. Since the close of that\r\nperiod many crustal oscillations have taken place, but no grand\r\nmountain-ranges have again been ridged up on the Atlantic sea-board.\r\nMeanwhile the Palæozoic mountain-chains, as we have seen, have suffered\r\nextensive denudation, have been planed down to sea-level, and even\r\nsubmerged. Subsequently converted into land, wholly or partially as\r\nthe case may have been, they now present the appearance of plains\r\nand plateaux of erosion, often deeply indented by the sea. No true\r\nmountains of elevation are met with anywhere in the coast-lands of the\r\nAtlantic, while volcanic action has well-nigh ceased. In short, the\r\nAtlantic margins have reached a stage of comparative stability. The\r\ntrough itself, however, is traversed by at least two well-marked banks\r\nof upheaval--the great meridional Dolphin Ridge, and the approximately\r\ntransmeridional Faröe-Icelandic belt--both of them bearing volcanic\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nBut while all the coast-lands of the Atlantic proper attained relative\r\nstability at an early period, those of the Mediterranean and Caribbean\r\ndepressions have up to recent times been the scenes of great crustal\r\ndisturbance. Gigantic mountain-chains were uplifted along their margins\r\nat so late a period as the Tertiary, and their shores still witness\r\nvolcanic activity.\r\n\r\nIt is upon the margins and within the trough of the Pacific Ocean,\r\nhowever, that subterranean action is now most remarkably developed.\r\nThe coast-lines of that great basin are everywhere formed of grand\r\nuplifts and volcanic ranges, which, broadly speaking, are comparable\r\nin age to those of the Mediterranean and Caribbean depressions. Along\r\nthe north-eastern margin of the Indian Ocean the coast-lines resemble\r\nthose of the Pacific, being of like recent age, and similarly marked\r\nby the presence of numerous volcanoes. The northern and western\r\nshores, however (as in Hindustan, Arabia, and East Africa), have\r\nbeen determined rather by regional elevation or by subsidence of the\r\nocean-floor than by axial uplifts--the chief crustal disturbances\r\ndating back to an earlier period than those of the East Indian\r\nArchipelago. It is in keeping with this greater age of the western and\r\nnorthern coast-lands of the Indian Ocean that volcanic action is now\r\nless strongly manifested in their vicinity.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the comparative stability of the earth's crust within\r\nthe Atlantic area as being evidenced by the greater age of its coastal\r\nranges and the declining importance of its volcanic phenomena. This\r\nrelative stability is further shown by the fact that the Atlantic\r\nsea-board is not much disturbed by earthquakes. This, of course, is\r\nwhat might have been expected, for earthquakes are most characteristic\r\nof volcanic regions and of those areas in which mountain-uplifts of\r\nrecent geological age occur. Hence the coast-lands of the Pacific and\r\nthe East Indies, the borders of the Caribbean Sea, the volcanic ridges\r\nof the Atlantic basin, the lands of the Mediterranean, the Black Sea,\r\nand the Aralo-Caspian depressions, the shores of the Red Sea, and vast\r\ntracts of southern Asia, are the chief earthquake regions of the globe.\r\nIt may be noted, further, that shocks are not only most frequent but\r\nmost intense in the neighbourhood of the sea. They appear to originate\r\nsometimes in the volcanic ridges and coastal ranges, sometimes under\r\nthe floor of the sea itself. Now earthquakes, volcanoes, and uplifts\r\nare all expressions of the one great fundamental fact that the earth\r\nis a cooling and contracting body, and they indicate the lines of\r\nweakness along which the enormous pressures and strains induced by the\r\nsubsidence of the crust upon its nucleus find relief. We cannot tell\r\nwhy the coast-lands of the Atlantic should have attained at so early\r\na period a stage of relative stability--why no axial uplifts should\r\nhave been developed along their margins since Palæozoic times. It may\r\nbe that relief has been found in the wrinkling-up of the floor of the\r\noceanic trough, and consequent formation of the Dolphin Ridge and other\r\ngreat submarine foldings of the crust; and it is possible that the\r\ngrowth of similar great ridges and wrinkles upon the bed of the Pacific\r\nmay in like manner relieve the coast-lands of that vast ocean, and\r\nprevent the formation of younger uplifts along their borders.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that two kinds of elevatory movements of\r\nthe crust are recognised by geologists--namely, axial and regional\r\nuplifts. Some, however, are beginning to doubt, with Professor\r\nSuess, whether any vast regional uplifts are possible. Yet the view\r\nthat would attribute all such apparent elevations of the land to\r\nsubsidence of the crust under the great oceanic troughs is not without\r\nits difficulties. Former sea-margins of very recent geological age\r\noccur in all latitudes, and if we are to explain these by sub-oceanic\r\ndepression, this will compel us to admit, as Suess has remarked, a\r\ngeneral lowering of the sea-level of upwards of 1000 feet. But it is\r\ndifficult to believe that the sea-floor could have subsided to such an\r\nextent in recent times. Suess thinks it is much more probable that the\r\nhigh-level beaches of tropical regions are not contemporaneous with\r\nthose of higher latitudes, and that the phenomena are best explained\r\nby his hypothesis of a secular movement of the ocean--the water being,\r\nas he contends, alternately heaped up at the equator and the poles.\r\nThe strand-lines in high latitudes, however, are certainly connected\r\nwith glaciation in some way not yet understood; and if it cannot be\r\nconfidently affirmed that they indicate regional movements of the land,\r\nthe evidence, nevertheless, seems to point in that direction.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this imperfect outline-sketch of a large subject, I\r\nought perhaps to apologise for having trespassed so much upon the\r\ndomains of geology. But in doing so I have only followed the example\r\nof geologists themselves, whose divagations in territories adjoining\r\ntheir own are naturally not infrequent. From much that I have said, it\r\nwill be gathered that with regard to the causes of many coastal changes\r\nwe are still groping in the dark. It seems not unlikely, however, that\r\nas light increases we may be compelled to modify the view that all\r\noscillations of the sea-level are due to movements of the lithosphere\r\nalone. That is a very heretical suggestion; but that a great deal can\r\nbe said for it any one will admit after a candid perusal of Suess's\r\nmonumental work, _Das Antlitz der Erde_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                               PLATE VI\r\n\r\n                 BATHY-HYPSOMETRICAL MAP OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE\r\n    _The map is coloured to show the surface relief of the Globe\r\n    without water in the Ocean Basins._\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION OF COLOURING\r\n    _The Colouring is graded from the Darkest Tint at the Highest Level\r\n    to the Lightest Tint on the Lowest._\r\n\r\n  The Edinburgh Geographical Institute        J.
