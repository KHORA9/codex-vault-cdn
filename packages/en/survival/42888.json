We were talking about hogs at\r\nthe time. A young girl overhearing our conversation, remonstrated with\r\nus because we appeared to have some of the habits of hogs wrong. We\r\nasked her how she knew we were wrong in our diagnosis of the hog? And\r\nshe answered:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess I ought to know, I was brought up among hogs, lived among\r\nthem all my life!\"\r\n\r\nThis is my case exactly, I have been brought up among skunk. I have made\r\na study of skunk, and I think I know skunk. I know this much well:\r\n\r\nYears ago the thought struck me that there ought to be money in raising\r\nskunk for fur and breeding purposes. To prove the right or wrong of\r\nthis, I started to raise skunk. I captured a female and her litter,\r\nlater got a star buck, and with this beginning I have succeeded in\r\nestablishing one of the largest and most successful skunk farms in\r\nAmerica, and I am proud of it.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to imply by this that I think I know \"it all\" about skunk.\r\nFar be it from that. But what I know has been learned by diligent study\r\nand the best of all \"practical experience.\" My farm was not a success\r\nfrom the start. It took a few years for me to learn the \"how of things,\"\r\nbut I am glad to say that things are looking bright for yours truly. I\r\nfirmly believe a few years more will see me independently rich, and from\r\nan old piece of land which would be practically worthless for any other\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nMy motive for writing this book is to benefit my fellow man. Hundreds of\r\npeople have written me for information about skunk. It would be\r\nimpossible for me to courteously answer one-tenth the mail I get in a\r\npersonal way. It struck me, inasmuch as there was no book on the market\r\ndevoted to the skunk that by compiling this information in readable form\r\nI would be accomplishing a certain amount of good.\r\n\r\nI feel this, too, if I had had the help in the first place--the\r\ninformation contained in this book--I would be worth twice as much more\r\nand saved myself years of trouble and much financial loss. I was the\r\npioneer, and was blazing the way for others to make success.\r\n\r\nTo all those who are desirous of trying the raising of fur-bearers for\r\nprofit we say: read this book carefully--study it,--and then if you feel\r\nthat you can make it a paying business, make a small enclosure and try a\r\nhalf dozen animals. By the end of a year or two, you will know whether\r\nyou are going to like it; whether you can make a success of it or not,\r\nand will have acquired a lot of very necessary knowledge regarding the\r\nanimals, that could not have been obtained in any other way. You will\r\nknow then whether to go ahead or not, and if the former, you will also\r\nknow how.\r\n\r\nWhile the U. S. Government is actively engaged in raising elk, buffalo,\r\ndeer and other animals including fur-bearers, few bulletins are issued\r\nwhich give any direct valuable information on skunk. Government\r\nofficials (the kid-glove kind) stick up their nose at the lowly skunk,\r\nand without reason. The skunk is a clean animal, easily domesticated,\r\nand known to be one of the most valuable animals to have around the\r\nfarm. Only recently has this been thoroughly demonstrated. Such\r\ninformation as could be obtained from government sources has been\r\nincorporated in this book.\r\n\r\nI have had no hesitancy in utilizing the information from other sources\r\nalso. Chief among them has been the Hunter-Trader-Trapper Magazine\r\npublished by A. R. Harding Pub. Co., of Columbus, Ohio, also his book on\r\n\"Fur Farming\" and such catalogues and guides as Andersch Bros. and\r\nothers fur firms issue to their trade.\r\n\r\nI differ with them when experience has taught me that my way of raising\r\nskunk is easier or more profitable, and I agree with them on many\r\ngeneral principles. I have incorporated in this book also the experience\r\nof many other farmers and trappers. I have found many helpful hints in\r\ntheir letters which have been very valuable to me. And for what\r\nknowledge I have gained from them, I hereby acknowledge my indebtedness.\r\n\"May they live long and prosper.\"\r\n\r\n     H. B. LAYMON.\r\nSpencer, Ind., July 10, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Laymon Handling an \"Unaltered\" Skunk.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGeneral Character of The Skunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skunk is a little understood animal. By this we mean, that ordinary\r\npeople, other than naturalists or scientists, little understand the\r\nhabits and value of skunk. By some the skunk is classed as a reptile or\r\nvarmint, and on account of its odor, is detested. Other animals throw\r\nscent, notably the mink and muskrat, of course not to the extent that\r\nthe skunk does.\r\n\r\nIt is on account of this scent, that skunks are detested. We have\r\nanimals on our farm which have never thrown a grain. And are yet in\r\ntheir wild state. They do not easily become frightened, hence have no\r\nuse for their means of protection. That's the only time they use it, and\r\nseldom when fighting among themselves.\r\n\r\nTo make a success out of anything, it is admitted one must know the\r\nthing. To be a successful farmer one must know what to raise and how. So\r\nwith raising of skunk, one must understand skunk, just as one\r\nunderstands horses, cows, sheep or poultry. And skunk, when properly\r\nunderstood can be raised in captivity at a great profit. 500,000 skins\r\nwere shipped to London last year, besides the skins which were used here\r\nin domestic manufacture.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to note the change in conditions, due largely to the\r\nenlightenment of the rural population to the benefits of the skunk, also\r\nto the rapid increase and value of their pelts. Many skunk farms are in\r\nexistence, the owners making a business of raising these animals for\r\ntheir pelts. While this may be a queer business, nevertheless it is\r\nperfectly legitimate, and as far as known, profitable. A ready sale of\r\nthe pelts is to be had, and the skins from these domesticated animals\r\ngenerally bring higher average prices, being well handled and killed at\r\na time when the fur is at its best. The domestic animal like cultivated\r\nfruits, are larger and in every way more valuable than the wild animal.\r\n\r\nThe skunk is found in nearly all the states and territories of the Union\r\nand climate and geographical conditions are responsible for the great\r\nvariation in size and color of its pelage. There are very few\r\nfur-bearing animals as plentiful, and especially in the civilized\r\nsections, that bring such a handsome income to the farmer as does the\r\nskunk. As noted, the chief difference in character, besides the size of\r\nthe animal itself, lies in the color of its fur.\r\n\r\nThe body is 16 to 22 inches long, its tail from root to farthest point\r\nof fur, 12 to 16 inches, the latter being covered with hair, the color\r\nof which varies, depending upon the color of the fur on the body. For\r\ninstance, the fur on the tail of a black or short striped skunk is black\r\nor nearly all black, (first grade) while that of the broad or narrow\r\nstriped skunk is interspersed with black and white hairs. While the skin\r\nof the animal is very valuable, the tail is rarely used, though\r\nmanufacturers of late years have consumed the hair in the manufacture of\r\nbrushes and similar purposes. The legs are short and close to the body,\r\nthe paw is naked and the five toes on each foot are closely grown\r\ntogether like that of the badger. The foot is well adapted to digging,\r\nbut they dig very little in the tame state. The toes are not webbed; the\r\nhead is small, with short, rounded ears and rather long, projecting\r\nnose, with two small piercing eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Skunk a Clean Animal.\r\n\r\nThe skunk in general appearance is always neat and clean, and in walking\r\nseemingly takes special pride, like the peacock, as when promenading,\r\nits tail is erect and its back peculiarly curved. Very few animals are\r\nas harmless as this creature and were it not for the peculiar odor which\r\nit distributes when in danger, it would be more hunted and probably\r\neradicated in sections. Its principal weapon, as heretofore noted, is a\r\npeculiar secretion and fluid possessing a very disagreeable odor. This\r\nfluid is of a pale yellow color and is discharged by the animal when in\r\ndanger, in thin-like streams and with such accuracy and aim as to strike\r\nany object within 6 to 12 feet. The fluid is secreted in two annal\r\nglands from which by the contraction of the sub-caudal muscles and by\r\nuplifting of the tail it is discharged in the form as stated above.\r\nThese sacs are now removed with very little trouble by farmers, and\r\nwithout endangering the fur or breeding qualities of the animal, or\r\nill-effect to the operator.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the scent sac has a tendency to increase the size of the\r\nanimal ultimately. We believe, too, that it requires less food to\r\nsustain life, consequently it is considered a profitable operation to\r\nperform. It is certain that the altered animal becomes more easily\r\ndomesticated.\r\n\r\nLearn to remove the scent sacs and thus avoid all complaints of\r\nneighbors and any personal inconvenience. If you learn to do this you\r\ncan sell your striped skunks for pets or curiosities and in this way get\r\ngood prices though the skins would be of small value.\r\n\r\nThe animal is carnivorous, nocturnal, not entirely terrestrial, as\r\noccasionally he is known to climb trees, perhaps not of choice but\r\nrather compulsion, being forced to this fancied secure position by the\r\nhunter or his dog. Consequently his arboreal, like his amphibious\r\nhabits, are rather undeserved credentials. The theory that the animal\r\nclimbs the trees in search of food and birds, is discredited. The animal\r\nis beneficial in many ways to the farmer, and his eradication from any\r\nfarming community should be prevented, and laws prohibiting the wanton\r\ndestruction encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe contrast in size of the animal and the important variation in the\r\ncolor of its pelage, due to climatic and geographical differences,\r\ncannot be denied. The breeding and inter-breeding of the different\r\ncolored furred species is the principal explanation why the young of a\r\nlitter are so much unlike in color. The color usually dominates to the\r\nblack. It is proven that 50% of the young of a white female will breed\r\nblacks if the male is black. To breed stars, the male and female should\r\nbe all black, if possible. 90% of such young will be black, and it is\r\npossible to raise to maturity 90% of such litters. It is our experience\r\nthat the female at rutting time will cohabit with more than one male\r\nlike a dog or rather like a cat which it more generally resembles.\r\n\r\nThe predominating color of the fur of all species is black and white\r\nwith the exception of the Texas skunk, which due to a peculiar soil, is\r\nof reddish cast. Some of the animals have a clear coat of fur, others\r\nare all black excepting a small white star, but the majority have two\r\nstripes, some terminating at the center of body, on others the stripe\r\ncontinuing from the forehead over the body, terminating at the tail.\r\n\r\nThis carnivorous and nocturnal animal is unlike most every other animal\r\npossessing these habits. He can be seen in the early morning returning\r\nto his haunts, and once in a while in the middle of the day; at no time\r\nis he in a hurry, or will he discommode himself by getting out of your\r\nsight or especially away from your path. His mode of locomotion is slow,\r\nand rarely will he be found away from his haunt a greater distance than\r\none or two miles. His abode is usually in a hollow log, under some old\r\nbarn or granary, or in a hole on the sunny side of some hill. He enjoys\r\na sun bath, probably more than does the bear or the badger. His meal is\r\nmade up by free consumption of worms, bugs, grasshoppers, mice, birds\r\nand eggs. In some sections he is known to be quite a vegetarian,\r\nconsuming as he does, roots, berries, vegetables, and fruits.\r\nOccasionally frequents the hen-roost, not only for eggs, but for the hen\r\nas well. The young like bread and milk, while we feed the old hominy\r\nhearts mixed with water and milk.\r\n\r\nThe animal passes the winter season in a state of incomplete\r\nhibernation, and at regular intervals he will arise, come out of his\r\nabode and expose his body to the sun, and judging from the effluvium,\r\nempty its distended pouches, but the stench thus caused, soon ceases,\r\nwhich is not the case when it is spurted under irritation or in\r\nself-defense. Dr. Coues states \"that the animal uses this secretion in\r\nthe relation of its perpetuation of the species, though overshadowed by\r\nits exaggeration into a powerfully effective means of preservation of\r\nthe individual, is evidently the same as in other species of Mustelidae,\r\neach one of which has its own emanation to bring the sexes together, not\r\nonly by simply indicating their whereabouts, but by serving as a\r\npositive attraction.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of the skunk, it would seem that the strong scent has\r\nactually tended to result in a more gregarious mode of life than is\r\nusual in this family of mammals; and it is certain, at any rate, that\r\nthe occupancy by one animal of a permanent winter abode serves to\r\nattract others to the same retreat. Burrows are sometimes found to\r\ncontain as many as a dozen individuals, not members of one family, but\r\nvarious adult animals drawn together. One other effect of the possession\r\nof such unique powers is seen not so much in mode of life as in the\r\nactual disposition of the creature. Its heedless familarity, its\r\ntemerity in pushing into places which other animals instinctively avoid\r\nas dangerous, and its indisposition to seek safety by hasty retreat, are\r\nevident results of its confidence in the extraordinary means of defense\r\nwith which it is provided.\r\n\r\nIn the domesticated state they do not use the scent only under extreme\r\nagitation. Dogs create this excitement, man seldom, even when handling\r\nthem. When held by the tail, they are really unable to throw the scent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Skunk.\r\n\r\nThe animal that has a clear, white-furred pelt is very sparingly found,\r\nin fact so seldom, that many consider it a freak of nature and not a\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nPersonally we do not find it pays to raise white skunk, save as pets, or\r\nthe females for breeding purposes. We dispose of them before they have\r\nbecome an expense to us. It is the wise man who can judge when to kill\r\nand when to keep.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Black Skunk.\r\n\r\nThe animal that has a black coat of fur is found in many states, those\r\nof New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Eastern\r\nCanada, are better furred, and in consequence command better prices than\r\nthose coming from the central states. The black skunk is also found in\r\nIllinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina and\r\nSouth Carolina, in fact in every locality excepting in the northwestern\r\nstates, also northwestern parts of Canada. The animal cohabits with the\r\nother species, and there is no apparent rule governing the breeding and\r\ninter-breeding and the probable coloration of the offspring. Somewhat\r\ndisregarding the color of the parents, the litter contains black, white,\r\nshort, narrow and broad striped youngsters. But 90% will \"take after\"\r\nfull black parents. If you use Star bucks you can reasonably expect Star\r\nstock. The fur of the black skunk, especially the eastern variety, is\r\nsoft, wavy, and of a deep lustrous black. Those animals that have only a\r\nsmall white furred star at the forehead are commercially called \"black\r\nskunk.\"\r\n\r\nGreat care should be taken in selecting the male breeders to avoid\r\nin-breeding. A skunk matures, or its fur becomes prime and salable in\r\nsix months. The female brings forth young in a year. The life of a skunk\r\nis from five to seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nShort Striped Skunk.\r\n\r\nThis animal inhabits the same section as the black skunk, the only\r\ndifference between them is that the small white star of the former\r\ndevelops into prongs or two distinct white-furred stripes, starting at\r\nthe forehead and terminating at or about the shoulders or center of\r\nbody. Quite often the forehead is entirely covered with white fur, and\r\nimmediately beginning at the top of head the white hair continues in two\r\nprongs, each varying in width from three-eighths to three-fourths of an\r\ninch. Should the white stripes continue clear across the body and\r\nterminate at the nail, such skins cannot be classed as short striped but\r\nare known as long, narrow or broad stripe.\r\n\r\nShort striped skins are second in value, the price being about one-third\r\nless than that of the black skins. The white stripes are of no value to\r\nthe manufacturer, and for that reason the skin that has the greatest\r\namount of black fur is worth more and the value lessened by the increase\r\nof the white stripe. The fur of the tail is black with intermingled\r\nwhite hairs. The disagreeable odor is removed by the dresser (tanner)\r\nand by the time the skin reaches the manufacturer, it is cleansed from\r\nall impurities and ready to be made into garments.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrow Striped Skunk.\r\n\r\nThis animal inhabits nearly every state and territory of the Union and\r\ngreater part of Canada, and is the true American skunk. His coat of fur\r\nis black, excepting two white stripes beginning at the forehead and\r\nterminating at the tail. The width of these stripes varies somewhat,\r\ndepending upon the size of the animal, usually three-eighths to\r\nthree-fourths of an inch. There is always a goodly portion of black fur\r\nbetween these stripes. The white stripes are narrow and close together,\r\nbut widen apart at center of back, and again narrowing when close to the\r\nroot of tail. The largest animals of the skunk family come under the\r\nlong or narrow striped species.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroad Striped Skunk.\r\n\r\nThis animal is found in common with the previous species, and its\r\ndifference is only in the width of the white stripe which is wider, and\r\nthe quantity of black fur on the skin is lessened, thereby diminishing\r\nthe value of the skin. There is no apparent iron-clad rule, or a\r\ndividing line between, or just where and when a skin should be called\r\nbroad stripe and not a narrow striped skin. This naturally must be left\r\nlargely to the judgment and discretion of the buyer or the manufacturer,\r\nwho, in grading, seeks an average more than any particular dividing\r\nline. The tail is covered with hairs with occasionally interspersed\r\nblack hairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Striped Skunk.\r\n\r\nThis animal has a long, horizontal white stripe extending from forehead,\r\ncontinuing over the body, terminating at root of the tail; the latter is\r\ncovered with white fur and is probably more bushy in proportion to its\r\nsize, than the other northwestern species. The skin is of no great\r\nvalue. The fur is rather coarse and the skins undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the above description it will be noted that the value of the pelt\r\nlies principally in the quantity of black fur; diminishing by the\r\nincrease of white and increasing by the lessening of the white fur.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to note that skunk fur after it is manufactured is\r\nnot sold as \"skunk,\" but is a good substitute for many different kinds\r\nof fur which has a higher value placed upon it.\r\n\r\nOf late years the white stripes that are cut out of the skins are being\r\nused in the manufacture of spurious tails which are dyed to imitate the\r\nnatural tail of mink, marten, etc. At other times these white pieces are\r\nsold in connection with other fur scraps or cuttings to hat\r\nmanufacturers. Only those skins that are prime in leather and full\r\nfurred, command good prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFur Farming--Supply and Demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the dawn of history in this country the fur trade has been an\r\nimportant branch of commerce and had much to do with the rapid advance\r\nof discovery and exploration in the early days. But the extensive\r\ntrapping operations since that time have sadly depleted the ranks of all\r\nspecies of fur-bearing animals and some of the most valuable are rapidly\r\nnearing extinction. This is especially true of the central and eastern\r\nportions of the United States, and the time is approaching when the ever\r\nincreasing demand for furs must be met by some way other than trapping\r\nthe wild animals--but how? Fur farming appears to offer the only\r\nsolution to the problem.\r\n\r\nThe raising of fur-bearing animals is still in its infancy, but many\r\nexperiments have been tried out from time to time, and it is a proven\r\nfact that if it is undertaken and carried out in an intelligent manner,\r\nthe industry is bound to be successful; and why not? All of our domestic\r\nanimals and fowls were wild creatures at one time.\r\n\r\nThere are practically no new and unexplored regions to trap and even in\r\nfaraway Siberia, which we are taught to believe a land of wilderness and\r\na fine fur-producing country, reports say that fur-bearers are becoming\r\nscarcer each year. The regions which have not yet been explored by the\r\nwhite men, have for many years been trapped by the savage inhabitants.\r\nFur traders push into all accessible districts, and the trappers also,\r\nsometimes bring their goods hundreds of miles in order to trade with the\r\nwhite people. South America produces some furs, but the catch is not\r\nheavy, perhaps because there is not much trapping done there. But the\r\nfurs from the more distant regions are, as a rule, of the more valuable\r\nkinds, and cannot supply the demand of the great middle class of people,\r\nthe largest consumers. Such furs cannot take the place of those of the\r\nmuskrat, skunk, raccoon and oppossum, for these furs are usually made up\r\nto imitate the more expensive kinds. But as the supply decreases the\r\ndemand increases at an equal rate.\r\n\r\nThe skunk, mink and muskrat do well in settled sections. There is always\r\na cash market for raw furs and since the discovery of America, raw furs\r\nhave been an important article of commerce. An industry paying the\r\nhunter and trapper probably $15,000,000 yearly is one that should\r\nreceive attention. The demand for furs is increasing as the population\r\nof the world is becoming more and more. Again furs are being put to more\r\nuses than ever. While the demand for furs is increasing, what of the\r\nsupply? The day, perhaps is not far in the distance when the demand will\r\ncall for two or three times as many furs as today. Where are they to\r\ncome from, if not from fur farming?\r\n\r\nA well known fur dealer in Minneapolis sizes up the situation in a\r\nnut-shell:\r\n\r\n  \"Under proper conditions, with intelligent care, raising fur animals\r\n  can be made to pay. The raiser starting on a small scale and\r\n  increasing as their knowledge increases. Most all successful business\r\n  is built up by starting small.\"\r\n\r\nConda J. Ham, in the Hunter-Trader-Trapper Magazine, says:\r\n\r\n  \"Did you ever stop to seriously think where your furs and your fur\r\n  coats would come from twenty or thirty years from now? At the rate\r\n  fur-bearing animals are being killed off at the present time, there\r\n  would not be fur enough thirty years from now to properly clothe the\r\n  nobility of the old world, to say nothing of our American women who\r\n  must have their new furs each season, and the others who must have at\r\n  least one or two sets during a lifetime. The fur industry is\r\n  admittedly fast dying a violent death. Some other remedy than those\r\n  already prescribed must be discovered. We still have sections of the\r\n  country where the same wild state of nature exists that could have\r\n  been found three hundred years ago. We still have plenty of\r\n  fur-bearing animals to keep alive their species if proper conditions\r\n  prevailed. Therefore, it would seem that the problem to solve is, how\r\n  can these conditions be best secured.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Norman A. Wood, expert taxidermist in the University of\r\n  Michigan's museum, the man most familiar with the animal life within\r\n  the state and one of the greatest authorities on animal life in the\r\n  whole Northwest, declares the fur industry can be saved only through\r\n  the medium of great fur farms. His study of the situation has\r\n  convinced him that the commercial growing of fur is coming to be one\r\n  of the great industries of America.\r\n\r\n  \"In various parts of the country such farms are to be found, and the\r\n  profit derived from them has been sufficient to prove the success of\r\n  the venture. Skunk farms have been started in various parts of the\r\n  United States within the past few years and are proving paying\r\n  enterprises.\r\n\r\n  \"It is no vague dream that prompts one to speak of fur farming. The\r\n  signs of the times point that way, indisputably. Every year the price\r\n  of raw furs bounds up to hitherto unknown levels, the demand is\r\n  constantly increasing almost as fast as the supply diminishes, and\r\n  with it having been demonstrated that fur-bearing animals can be\r\n  raised, men are not going to let such chances slip by.\"\r\n\r\nA. R. Harding, editorially in the same magazine says, speaking of fur\r\nfarming:\r\n\r\n  \"The business surely looks like a \"gold mine\" at present prices of fur\r\n  and breeding stock. Even should prices be reduced by one-half or more\r\n  the business bids to continue very profitable.\r\n\r\n  \"While scores, perhaps hundreds, will make good with the more valuable\r\n  foxes--black-silver, cross--thousands will find that profits may not\r\n  be so great (neither is the expense to get started) with the common\r\n  red fox, skunk, mink, marten, coon, oppossum and muskrat, yet the\r\n  raising of these animals is not apt to influence values. The world\r\n  needs millions of these skins each year, and the market is not so\r\n  limited as with the high priced furs. Looks like a great future for\r\n  the raiser of these animals. There is no denying the fact that the\r\n  supply of wild fur bearers is gradually becoming less, not only in\r\n  America, but throughout the entire world, while the demand for furs is\r\n  constantly increasing.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a bright future to \"Fur Farming.\" The person who knows something\r\nof the habits of the animal or animals that they expect to raise, will\r\nbe the successful one. The same applies to fur farming. The farmer who\r\nhas given attention to fur-bearing animals are the ones most apt to be\r\nsuccessful. A good many attempts were made at raising skunks, a number\r\nof years ago, most of which were failures. Some entered the business on\r\na large scale, knowing nothing of the animals, and of course failed;\r\nothers \"penned up\" a few skunks and as they were not properly cared for,\r\nfailure was the result.\r\n\r\nThe advanced price for skunk skins in recent years, has caused a revival\r\nin their raising. This time, an entirely different class of people are\r\ntaking up the work, and they are going to succeed. Why? Because they\r\nknow something of the animal and are going at the business in a calm and\r\nbusiness-like way.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: One of Laymon's Stars.]\r\n\r\nPeople are not investing their all in a business without realizing the\r\npossibility of success or failure. More is known of the Skunk today. It\r\nis not the feared animal that it was yesterday. The day is not far\r\ndistant when it will take its rightful place among fur-bearers and its\r\nhides sold for what they really are. There is hardly a more finer fur\r\nthan skunk and it should not be necessary to hide its identity under a\r\nsubstitute name.\r\n\r\nThe fur farmer, should the market be low for certain animals, can keep\r\nover. Nine times in ten, this is the time to raise as many as possible,\r\nfor by another season, that particular article is likely to be in\r\ndemand. To illustrate: In the winter of 1908-09, No. 1 skunks from\r\nnorthern and eastern sections were worth $2.00, while the following\r\nwinter the same skins were bringing just twice this figure. If the skunk\r\nraisers who sold off their stock at low prices because the prospect was\r\nnot bright, had gone ahead they would have had a heavy crop of fur to\r\nmarket at high prices by January, 1910.\r\n\r\nSome reports from those who have experimented in a small way at raising\r\nfur animals is to the effect that they do not fur properly. This is true\r\nin regard to skunk, when kept in a box or a small enclosure for weeks\r\nand fed largely on meat. They must have contact with earth and be\r\nallowed to forage for food.\r\n\r\nSkunk breed only once a year, unless the first litter are killed or die,\r\nwhen another is sometimes born, and it might be said, such is frequently\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nOne thing is important, and that is, get the animals accustomed to their\r\nkeeper as soon as possible. The old will be wild for some time, but the\r\nyoung soon become tame. Skunk are easily tamed, even children have\r\nsafely handled them.\r\n\r\nA man who has been in the fur farming industry for years, in response to\r\nthe inquiry, \"Will the business pay?\" says: \"Yes, it will pay the right\r\nman big dividends on the capital invested.\" The right man is one who has\r\nnatural aptitude for this sort of work, and who is \"cut out\" for fur\r\nfarming. If he has a liking for this sort of work, he will study the\r\nnature and requirements of the animals and attend carefully to their\r\nevery want.\r\n\r\nFur farming as an industry is only in its infancy, in fact, not begun.\r\nThe future looks bright to those who engage in the business in a\r\nbusiness way. To those who expect to make a fortune at the business in a\r\nyear or two, we predict failure, but to all who are willing to go at the\r\nindustry intelligently, building a substantial enclosure, paying the\r\nsame careful attention to the feed and care of their fur animals that\r\nthey would to other \"stock,\" to get the best results, far more than\r\nordinary profits should result.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances skunk can be raised to maturity at a cost\r\nof about 25c. The cheapest skin on the market will bring at least a\r\ndollar, from that to live skunk at $15. Average profit will be over 400%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEnclosures, Dens, Food and Care.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enclosure for a fur farm is one of the most important things for a\r\nbeginner to consider, for if it is not properly constructed, his labor\r\nis in vain. We have heard of parties going to a great expense to procure\r\nthe animals and construct a fence to hold them, and because the fence\r\nwas not built on right lines, the animals escaped. This was unnecessary\r\nhad the netting or galvanized iron fencing extended about 18 inches\r\nbelow the surface. Skunk seldom dig over a foot into the ground.\r\n\r\nThe proper size of an enclosure depends on the number and kinds of\r\nanimals you intend to start with. For 10 skunks or less and their\r\noffspring the first year we suggest an enclosure measuring 3 rods wide\r\nby 4 rods long or 12 square rods. This will even answer for a much\r\nlarger number, but we do not believe in crowding. For 20 skunks and the\r\nfirst year's young the enclosure should measure about 4 rods in width by\r\n5 in length.\r\n\r\nYou can successfully raise a hundred skunk on a single acre of ground.\r\n\r\nAfter you have decided on this business the first thing is to find the\r\nproper location and make a suitable enclosure. There should be a spring\r\non, or a small stream crossing the ground to be inclosed, but at the\r\nsame time the ground must not be wet; in fact, it should be of rather\r\ndry nature, so that there will not be too much dampness in the dens.\r\nThat is the picture of an ideal skunkery.\r\n\r\nBut running water is not absolutely necessary so long as the animals are\r\nfurnished clear water for drinking purposes. There should be banks of\r\nearth for the animals to den in and the ground should have a gradual\r\nslope so that it will drain readily. If it is of a sandy nature it will\r\nbe all the better. Some who have tried skunk farming have located the\r\nyards on a shore of a small lake or pond and have included a portion of\r\nthe pond in the enclosure. This is a good idea and it will not be\r\nnecessary to extend the fence very deep into the water, as the skunk is\r\nnot a water animal and will not dive under; however, where the fence\r\ncrosses a stream of running water the fence should reach to the bed of\r\nthe stream as the water will fall considerably during dry weather. Where\r\nrunning water is not to be had a basin of water should be provided for\r\nbathing purposes. They bathe about once a week. This is a habit little\r\nknown by the amateur fur farmer.\r\n\r\nThe enclosures should be large as possible. When the animals are\r\ninclosed in small yards or pens they become infested with fleas, ticks,\r\netc., and they do not do well. By sprinkling the animals with poultry\r\npowder usually used to destroy lice, and allowing the animal to den in\r\nsoft soil these parasites can be easily eradicated. Such small enclosures\r\nwill answer for a short time but as soon as possible they should be\r\nplaced in a large roomy yard.\r\n\r\nTo enclose a certain amount of ground with the smallest number of rods\r\nof fencing possible, the plat or ground to be enclosed should be in a\r\nsquare. While the cost of enclosing an oblong piece of ground would be a\r\nfew dollars more than if square, this should not stand in the way if the\r\noblong piece of ground would make a better home for your fur-bearing\r\nanimals. If one only desires to experiment with a few animals and has\r\nthe material on hand, he may make a fence of boards, but it should not\r\nbe depended on for long. Where stones are set up edgewise or cement\r\nused, it is rather expensive and as galvanized wire lasts well either in\r\nthe ground, where not exposed to the air, or being galvanized, it stands\r\nthe elements well, it seems to meet the requirements of the fur farmer\r\nfor fencing or enclosure purposes. There should be some trees, or at\r\nleast shade, no matter what animals you are experimenting with.\r\n\r\nFor fencing material, galvanized wire netting of one-inch mesh is\r\ngenerally used for the breeding yards, and 1½-inch for the outside\r\nfence, as the young animals will escape through a two-inch mesh. The\r\noutside fence should be seven feet in height. Under ordinary conditions\r\nthe skunk would not escape over a four-foot fence, but there is danger\r\nin winter from drifting snow, and dogs and other animals must be kept\r\nout at all times; therefore, the fence should be of the height mentioned\r\nand it must be turned in at the top or a sheet of tin placed along the\r\nedge to prevent the animals from climbing out.\r\n\r\nSome skunk raisers simply place flat stones on top of the ground at the\r\nfoot of the fence to prevent the animals from digging out, and some say\r\nthat one of the most satisfactory ways is to place small mesh wire\r\nnetting flat on the ground at the foot of the fence, inside, of course,\r\nand cover lightly with dirt. They claim that this is a very good way to\r\nprevent skunks from escaping by digging, but on the whole we think that\r\nthe method of sinking the netting or galvanized iron about 18 inches\r\nbelow the surface is best.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fence of poultry netting, covered with sheet tin,\r\n   showing foundation.]\r\n\r\nThe persons who expect to make \"fur farming\" a business, can begin in a\r\nsmall way and same need not interfere with other work to a great extent.\r\nYear after year, as they learn more of the business, they can enlarge\r\nthe grounds. Farmers and others who from experience know much of the\r\nanimals, will no doubt be the most successful from the start. The ox,\r\nhorse and sheep were wild at one time, but they have become domesticated.\r\nWhy not the same with the fur-bearers? This is exactly what should be\r\ndone. Skunks especially, are very easily domesticated. When the raiser\r\nlearns this and furnishes an enclosure with dens and food similar to\r\nthat which they get when in their wild state, they will be on the road\r\nto success.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fence of Netting, Showing Support and turned in top.]\r\n\r\nOn the Laymon farm we have been experimenting with galvanized iron or\r\ntin fencing, and we prefer it to wire netting. The animals appear more\r\ncontented when they cannot see other and wider fields. This is\r\nespecially true during the breeding season. This fencing is a better\r\nprotection against dogs and prowling animals also on the outside.\r\n\r\nIn the case of galvanized iron fencing, we find that the fence need not\r\nbe over five feet, with 3 or 4 strands of barbed wire to keep out dogs\r\nand prowling animals. The animals do not see out, nor prowlers in and\r\nhence the skunk are less liable to become excitable.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the enclosure should be divided into compartments, using\r\nnetting or galvanized tin for the fences but they need not be so high.\r\nThe largest compartment would be for the females and there should be a\r\nsmaller one for the males, also one for the young animals after they\r\nhave become large enough to take care of themselves. Some also make\r\nsmall yards in which to place the females, two or three together, after\r\nthe young animals are born. The most of those who have tried skunk\r\nbreeding, however, have not found this necessary, but there should\r\nalways be a separate enclosure for the males. When the number of animals\r\nincreases it will be necessary to have a few small breeding yards, large\r\nenough for ten or twelve animals. One need not, however, make such an\r\nelaborate enclosure in the start but can enlarge it as needed, adding\r\nmore compartments.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Breeding Range Constructed of Galvanized Iron.]\r\n\r\nIn each compartment a number of dens should be made by digging a trench\r\nand covering afterwards. While the animals will dig dens if necessary,\r\nthey prefer even while in a wild state to use dens already made. Boxes,\r\nbarrels or pens with board floors should not be used. Some of the\r\nsuccessful ones claim that this has a tendency to cause a thick pelt and\r\nthin fur and say that it is absolutely necessary that they have natural\r\ndens in the ground. The dens should be made quite deep so that there\r\nwill be no danger from frost in winter and in all cases there should be\r\nplenty of straw or leaves for bedding purposes. Where the land is flat\r\nit seems wise to throw up a few mounds of earth so that the animal may\r\ndig into the soil. A hole can be started in a bank with a post-hole\r\nauger and the animal will finish it, seldom burrowing more than a foot\r\nfurther into the earth.\r\n\r\nNo matter what style of den is used it should be so constructed that\r\nthere is no danger of it getting damp. Banks of earth of a kind which do\r\nnot absorb and retain water make good places in which to dig dens, and\r\nit is easy to incline the entrance so that water from rain or melting\r\nsnow cannot drain into the passage. The entrance should be made large\r\nenough so that the animals can pass in and out easily, for if the\r\npassage is small there is danger that the fur will be injured. There\r\nshould also be plenty of dens, so that if one becomes damp or infested\r\nwith vermin, the occupants can take up their quarters elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn the Laymon farm we have several different kinds. The breeding pens\r\nare built par-to keep out the rain. After we have once ascertained that\r\nthe young have arrived we do not disturb the female for several days,\r\nsave to see that she has plenty to eat and drink. Females are quite\r\ndevoted to her young. The entrance is of wood and in some cases tiling.\r\nThe opening should be large to avoid rubbing the fur.\r\n\r\nThe summer dens are of natural earth formed or dug into earth, built\r\naround straw or wood, with tile entrance.\r\n\r\nThe winter dens are large, built like a well with a cave-like entrance.\r\nThese things are necessary only where skunk are raised on a large scale.\r\nAs far as possible, we do not allow the fur of the animal to come in\r\ncontact with rough surfaces other than earth. We only allow one female\r\nin a brood pen at one time, and use galvanized iron fencing between the\r\npens. Females will steal one another's young when given the chance\r\ncausing the young animals to starve to death, and we don't give them the\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nThe skunks are perfectly cleanly about the dens and always deposit their\r\ndroppings in one corner, or outside. They seldom discharge their scent\r\nand unless he were to see it, one might pass close by a skunk \"ranch\"\r\nand never know it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding.\r\n\r\nSkunks should have plenty of food especially during the summer and they\r\nshould be fed at regular intervals, giving just enough for a meal each\r\ntime. It is advisable to give a mixed diet, partly animal and partly\r\nvegetable. They will eat almost all kinds of flesh and fish, table\r\nscraps, fruits, especially if very ripe, melons, sweet potatoes, berries,\r\netc. One of the most satisfactory foods is bread and milk, but it is\r\nconsidered too expensive by some people. However, it should be given\r\noccasionally. They will eat carrion, but such food should not be given,\r\nfor it is likely to cause disease. In the fall especially, when they are\r\nlaying on fat for winter, they should have plenty of food. In winter\r\nthey do not require so much. It is a lack of meat food that causes them\r\nto eat their young and one should feed well during the spring and autumn.\r\n\r\nSkunks feed largely on insects, grubs, etc., and if they have range\r\nenough will supply themselves with the greater portion. They are fond of\r\neggs, either fresh or spoiled, and should be given a feed of this kind\r\noccasionally if possible. They also have a fondness for poultry.\r\n\r\nThe matter of providing sufficient food is not as difficult as it would\r\nappear at first glance. If the farm is located near a large town,\r\nbutchers, hotel and restaurant keepers will generally save table scraps,\r\nstale bread, etc., on request, if one will make a regular habit of\r\ncalling for it. This is why it seems desirable to establish a skunkery\r\nclose to or in a city. Even in the country the neighbors will help out.\r\nThe farmers will be only too glad to have you take the dead stock,\r\npoultry, etc., thus saving them the time and labor of otherwise\r\ndisposing of it.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the Laymon Skunkery is an ideal farm. We have a large\r\nrange of gully land through which runs a natural spring, and is covered\r\nwith a dense underbrush. The skunk run wild here, male and female\r\nbreeders after the regular rutting season is over. We feed them only\r\nonce a day, at evening, and that mostly hominy hearts mixed with water\r\nand milk. Just now, June 23rd, they are as fat as prime porkers and in\r\nexcellent condition. We are experimenting on cutting out all meat for at\r\nleast five days each week. We maintain that 25c will cover the expense\r\nof raising a skunk to maturity. They are wild for mulberries and\r\n\"roasting ears.\" Enjoy ripe apples and roots. Relish clover, and like\r\ncats get crazy over fish, and there is no doubt about them liking \"cat\r\nmeat,\" and the flesh of rabbits, fresh or tainted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding.\r\n\r\nThe mating season comes late in February and in March and the young\r\nanimals make their appearance in May, the period of gestation being\r\nabout nine weeks. The young are born hairless or furless, and remain\r\nblind from 4 to 5 weeks. The mother will wean her young at from 7 to 9\r\nweeks of age. Care should be taken to note the symptoms, as when the\r\nyoung refuse to be weaned, the mother is likely to injure them. They are\r\nfully matured in six months, and their hides become prime and ready for\r\nmarket. They breed when a year old and live about 7 years.\r\n\r\nAfter weaning the young should be allowed to run wild in a pen where\r\nthere are other young animals. But not with the old males until such a\r\ntime as they are able to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nOne male animal will easily serve eight or ten females and he should be\r\nleft in their company a number of days. After that he should be removed\r\nand to make certain, another male should be installed for a few days.\r\nTwo males should never be allowed in an inclosed pen with the females at\r\none time or they will fight and one or both may be seriously injured.\r\nThey seem to know enough to keep out of each other's way on the range.\r\n\r\nWe believe, however, that to allow the males and females to run wild (if\r\nthe range is large enough) has a tendency to create larger litters. We\r\nbelieve that the females cohabit with more than one male at rutting time\r\nand that additional young are created at each service. We know that our\r\nlitters are larger in number than is ordinarily supposed, ranging from\r\nsix to ten, whereas when served by one as above, the litters averaged\r\nfrom four to eight.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be exercised in the selection of the males for\r\nbreeding stock. Only the large and healthy animals of good color should\r\nbe used and all others should be killed and their skins marketed, or the\r\nlive altered animals sold for pets, while they are in good condition.\r\nNever allow a breeder to die of old age. Sell the pelts early and use\r\nyoung stock for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWhile the animals do not always breed strictly true to color, the white\r\nmarkings may be greatly reduced and the general stock improved by\r\nselected breeding. One should, each year secure fresh breeding stock\r\nfrom other localities and related animals should not be allowed to breed\r\ntogether or in a few years the result will be disastrous. One can not be\r\ntoo careful in this respect for it is very important.\r\n\r\nAfter the mating season the female should be separated, placed in small\r\nenclosures and they should be well fed or otherwise they may kill and\r\neat the young. They should be allowed to remain in these small\r\nenclosures until the young animals are large enough to take care of\r\nthemselves, when they should be separated and the females may again be\r\nplaced in the large enclosure.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the breeding season until late in the fall the\r\nanimals require a larger amount of food than during the winter and\r\nespecially during the breeding season and while the mother is still\r\nnursing the young they will require plenty of nourishing food. They\r\nrequire fresh drinking water at all times and the enclosures should be\r\nso arranged that each compartment will be supplied.\r\n\r\nAs before stated one should use care in selecting animals for breeding\r\npurposes as it is in this way that the quality of the fur will be\r\nimproved and the business made to be a profitable one. If you wish to\r\nincrease the number of animals do not be tempted for the sake of the\r\nhigher prices realized for the finer skins to kill off animals that\r\nshould be kept for breeding.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, one should study the habits of the animals on every\r\nopportunity and attend to their wants. If one will give the proper\r\nattention to the animals and take an interest in them there is no reason\r\nwhy he should not succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTrapping, Skinning, Shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skunk belongs to the weasel family, and is nocturnal in its habits,\r\nbut unlike other fur-bearing animals of the weasel family, lacks\r\nalertness. It is exceedingly slow in locomotion compared with other\r\nanimals, and naturally falls an easy prey to the average hunter or\r\ntrapper.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback and reason why this animal was not extensively hunted\r\nor trapped and the skin marketed twenty or thirty years ago, was the\r\ndanger of being sprayed with their peculiar essence. The fur is fine and\r\neagerly sought after, especially the black furred skins, which bring\r\nhigh prices. As many as 500,000 skunk skins are marketed in a year.\r\n\r\nThe skins are generally divided into four or five distinct grades, and\r\neach grade is then assorted accordingly to quality and size. Skunks\r\nshould not be killed for the pelt out of season, but this is true of all\r\nanimals, where the furred skin has a market value. The open season for\r\nMinnesota, Dakotas, Iowa, Wisconsin, Montana and northern sections, is\r\nfrom November 1st to February 15th, varying somewhat upon the weather.\r\nSouth or middle states the season opens somewhat earlier, and naturally\r\ncloses on approach of warm weather. The fur of the skunk is the first of\r\nall fur bearing animals to become prime, and is also first to suffer the\r\nloss of its lustre and primeness.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Kill Without Being Scented.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways and methods in common use for capturing and killing\r\nthis animal, but probably the best is the use of steel traps, though a\r\nlong stick is equally as good, providing the one who holds it\r\ncomprehends his business and uses same advantageously. The author has\r\nknown two lads to kill and skin forty skunks in a day. Of course, great\r\ncare must be exercised to kill the animal without receiving a discharge\r\nof the perfume. A six to eight foot long stick, one and a half to two\r\ninches in diameter is the proper weapon and instrument to use in killing\r\nskunks. A smart blow on the back about one to two inches beyond the tail\r\nwill readily fell the animal. This blow will paralyze and benumb the\r\nmuscles and nerves employed by the animal to distribute its obnoxious\r\nfluid. An additional blow is necessary, and the latter should be given\r\non top of the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteel Traps.\r\n\r\nSteel traps are used with good effect. They should be set just before\r\nthe hole and be covered with loose bits of dirt, leaves or other\r\nvegetation. Some prefer to use bait, the latter can be a beef head, a\r\nchicken, or, in fact, any chunk of old meat or carcass. Drag same in\r\nvarious ways and drop in a conspicuous place or in center of a nest of\r\ntraps. The trap should be attached to a clog, or loose bushes, never\r\nattach two traps to the same article. Skunks often spring traps set for\r\nmink, wolf and other animals, but seldom devour or even touch a victim\r\nshould they come upon same while making their nocturnal visits.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Box Trap.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Box Trap for Catching small Animals Alive.]\r\n\r\nThe usual bait for skunk is birds, bits of meat, pieces of chicken and\r\nrabbit, whether old or fresh. A good method and trap is to bury a large\r\ndry-good box; see that the top is even with the surface of the earth,\r\nplace light brushes, hay or straw across the opening, upon which\r\nsprinkle a little loose earth. Some prefer to make an artificial opening\r\nin top of box after same is buried, into which the skunk will descend,\r\nrather fall in, but cannot get out. Some strong smelling bait should be\r\nplaced in the box, which is to attract the animal from a distance. As\r\nmany as eight skunks have been caught during one night by the use of\r\nthis style of box trap. This seems to prove that skunk do not make a\r\nnoise when caught.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Barrel Trap.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Barrel Trap. If Set on the Slope of a Hill, Will Capture\r\n   More Than one Animal.]\r\n\r\nAnother method is the so-called barrel trap. A sugar, vinegar or whisky\r\nbarrel will answer. Remove the head and securely fasten the bait on\r\ninside of bottom of barrel. Place the barrel in a slanting position,\r\nopen part toward the earth, and arrange by balancing the barrel in such\r\na way that when the skunk enters by crawling up in a barrel, being\r\nattracted there by the bait, the barrel with the skunk will tip over and\r\nMr. Skunk fall on his nose inside of the barrel and be a captive. This\r\nis a good and cheap trap and the victim cannot get out, though only one\r\nanimal can be caught at one time. Some trappers dig the skunk out,\r\nothers dig until they reach the cavity in which they usually have their\r\nnests and are found huddled up together in a bunch. If found in such a\r\nposition it is an easy matter to suffocate them, thus obliterating all\r\npossible chances of the animals distributing their obnoxious perfume.\r\nAll that is necessary after one sees the animals is to cover them up\r\nwith soft dirt, which should be lightly tamped every two inches of\r\nfilling and continued until about fifteen to eighteen inches is securely\r\ntamped. In about fifteen to twenty minutes the trapper can uncover the\r\nden by removing the earth, and he will find the animals suffocated.\r\nAfter all, it is poor policy to suffocate whole dens of skunk. They\r\nshould be caught alive.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, but we recommend for the trapper, (new beginners) or\r\nhunters, to remove the perfume containers (glands) before skinning as\r\none is likely to cut into the bags and distribute the perfume, but if\r\nremoved all danger of coming in contact with the liquid weapon is of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nSkunks, when located in holes, can be smoked out or suffocated, either\r\nwith common smoke or vapors arising from burning sulphur. To locate the\r\ndistance of digging, insert a long switch or telegraph wire into the\r\nhole. The author has personally seen trappers dig down for a short\r\ndistance and then reach after the animals with their hands, and sure\r\nenough they succeed in bringing the animals, one by one, from their den.\r\nStrange as it seems no perfume was discharged. This is probably due to\r\nthe fact that the other trapper assisted by knocking them senseless\r\nimmediately after their heads appeared through the hole. A piece of\r\n¾-inch round iron, about twelve inches in length, was used. Trappers\r\nrelate and claim that it is a positive fact that the skunk will refrain\r\nfrom biting or discharging perfume while in their holes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A Battery of Brooding Dens on the Laymon Farm.]\r\n\r\nDeadfalls, figure four and other home-made traps can be employed, though\r\nthe animal must be skinned promptly, and often the fur becomes damaged\r\nfrom the instrument itself or by long delay and exposure to the weather.\r\nThere are many other methods and ways to capture and kill this animal,\r\nbut by the foregoing any one contemplating to trap or hunt will have the\r\nessential knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe rifle can be used whenever possible, but the use of the shotgun is\r\ndetrimental to the skin, and its use should be prevented when the\r\nquestion of its fur is taken into consideration. The animal should not\r\nbe entirely eradicated from any particular locality, as the skunk is\r\nmore beneficial than harmful to the farms, and again, the killing of\r\nskunks out of season is entirely absurd and uncalled for, the animal\r\nbeing harmless. The meat while not generally consumed, can be used,\r\nthough when fried, it is dry and tough, resembling bull meat in that\r\nrespect. The fat is used for medicinal purposes. Skunk oil is highly\r\nrecommended for sore throat, croup, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nKilling, Skinning and Stretching.\r\n\r\nWhen \"killing time\" comes, care should be taken to not frighten the\r\nanimals left for breeding purposes more than is absolutely necessary.\r\nAll animals that are tame enough should be driven into a separate\r\nenclosure and out of sight of the others before being killed. Perhaps as\r\ngood a method of killing as any is to use a good club, striking on the\r\nhips just over the region of the scent sac. Skunk should be killed\r\nwithout the enclosure becoming strongly scented. A pole several feet\r\nlong with a strong loop on the end can be slipped over their tails. The\r\nanimal can now be lifted clear off the ground and carried wherever the\r\nkilling is desired. Drowning is not recommended, as it takes the fur\r\nhours to dry and is therefore extra work. Some even claim that the\r\nwater spoils the luster of the fur to a certain extent.\r\n\r\nSkunk do not leave their dens during severe weather, so that it is\r\nadvisable to begin selecting those that are to be killed days and even\r\nweeks in advance of the time decided upon. These should be placed in an\r\nenclosure or pen by themselves so that the remaining ones will not be\r\ndisturbed. Animals selected need not be operated upon, though the scent\r\nsac should be removed before skinning.\r\n\r\nThe animals that are to be kept for breeding purposes need not be fed so\r\nheavily during the winter months or after those that were intended for\r\nmarket have been killed. Of course in the spring after the females have\r\nyoung, they must be fed heavily.\r\n\r\nSome raisers as soon as the young are weaned, select those that are to\r\nbe killed the coming winter, keeping them separate from the breeding\r\nstock so that they can be fed properly. That is a great saving of food,\r\nas those for market should be fed much more than the breeders at this\r\nseason--say during the months of September, October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Methods of Skinning.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct methods of skinning fur-bearing animals, and\r\nskins are known as \"cased\" or \"open\" skins, according to the method of\r\nremoving the pelt. Open skins are those removed by ripping the skin down\r\nthe belly and are stretched out flat. Cased skins are those drawn off\r\nthe body from the tail to the head, by ripping the skin on the backs of\r\nthe hind legs.\r\n\r\nThe skunk skins should be cased. Cut off the front feet with a knife or\r\nhatchet, cut around the hind feet and rip down the back of the hind\r\nlegs, using care when cutting and skinning around the scent glands.\r\nSplit the tail about one-third of its length on the under side, and skin\r\nit that far by using the knife; then strip it from the bone by means of\r\na split stick. Grasp the stick with your right hand, palm up, and with\r\nthe tail between the second and third fingers, tail pointing up; hold\r\nthe carcass by placing the left hand on the hind quarters; close your\r\nright hand and give a steady pull upwards and the skin will be stripped\r\nfrom the tail quickly and easily. Now draw the skin downward, off the\r\nbody, to the shoulders. Here two thin muscles will insist on hanging\r\nfast to the skin; put your finger under them and tear them loose. You\r\ncan now get hold of the front legs, and strip the skin from them. Strip\r\nthe skin on down to the head, then feel for the base of the ears and\r\ncut them off close to the head. Skin on to the eyes; here you must use\r\nthe knife again, but use care not to enlarge the eye aperture. Cut the\r\nskin loose about the mouth and the end of the nose, but don't cut the\r\nnose off the skin. The pelt now resembles a small, narrow sack, with fur\r\nside in. Before you lay it down, turn it with the fur side out and thus\r\nkeep the skin clean until you are ready to flesh and stretch it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkins Should be Fleshed.\r\n\r\nThe skin of any animal should be fleshed and stretched as soon as\r\npossible after it is removed from the carcass. If the weather is\r\nsomewhat warm and the skin remains uncleaned and unstretched a day or\r\ntwo, it may start to taint.\r\n\r\nFor fleshing cased skins I use two boards, one about three inches wide\r\nand three feet long for small skins, and the other five inches wide and\r\nfour feet long for larger ones. These fleshing boards must be perfectly\r\nsmooth and flat. They should not be beveled towards the edge like a\r\nstretching board, but should have the edges slightly rounded.\r\n\r\nBefore fleshing a cased skin be sure that there are no burrs or other\r\nforeign substances in the fur, for such would cause you to cut the skin,\r\nthen draw the pelt on the board, fur side in. Now with the base of the\r\nboard resting on the floor and the nose against your chest, shove the\r\nfat and flesh from the skin with the knife or hatchet, from the head to\r\nthe tail. The instrument should be held at an angle of about 40 degrees.\r\nDon't try to flesh on the edge of the board or you will injure the skin.\r\nTurn the skin occasionally until you are all the way around and the pelt\r\nis perfectly clean of flesh and fat. The thin sheet of muscle found on\r\nthe back of the skunk should not be removed, but the loose rolls behind\r\nthe shoulders should be removed down to a point where it appears to be\r\nfirmly attached to the skin. Don't scrape away at a skin of any kind\r\nuntil nothing remains but the scarf skin and the fur. There is such a\r\nthing as overdoing it, and one should remember that he is only to remove\r\nthe loose parts, which are not a part of the skin. Skunk, oppossum, and\r\nmuskrats are the skins which are the most likely to be overdone, and the\r\nskunk in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\nStretching Important.\r\n\r\nAfter the skins are fleshed they are ready for stretching. I advise the\r\nuse of the three-piece board. To use the three-piece board, turn the\r\nskin with the flesh side out and insert the two main pieces of the\r\nboard, the flat edges together; draw the skin down to its full extent\r\nand fasten the hind legs with two nails to each. Be sure that the skin\r\nis on the board squarely, the back on one side, and the belly on the\r\nother, then insert the wedge between the two pieces of the board. Put\r\nthe wedge in firmly, but don't drive it in with a hammer, for there is\r\nsuch a thing as over-stretching a skin. Then draw the back down and\r\nfasten it with two nails near the root of the tail. Then turn the board\r\nover, and stretch the other side, fastening it also with two nails. Now\r\nfasten all the edges by placing the nails 1½ or 2 inches apart,\r\nkeeping the legs one-half on each side of the board. See that the nose\r\nof the skin does not slip over the end of the board and fasten the skin\r\nof the lower jaw with two nails. The tail of the skunk must be stretched\r\nout flat as far as it is split. Now take your jackknife and make a little\r\nincision in the tip of the tail of all animals except the otter. This is\r\nto allow the air to circulate and let the moisture drain out. If the\r\nweather is very warm, put a little salt in the tail to keep it from\r\ntainting. The loss of the tail will detract heavily from the value of\r\nthe skin, and in case the bone has broken off, as happens sometimes, the\r\ntail should be opened on the under side and the bone removed. After the\r\ntail is attended to, loop a string around the nails in the lower jaw and\r\nhang the pelt in a cool, dry, airy place to cure. Be sure that it swings\r\nfree, and does not rest against the other skins.\r\n\r\nA few remarks about packing furs for shipment may not come amiss. Never\r\nship furs until they are perfectly dry for they may taint in shipping.\r\nIt is not necessary, however, for the tails to be perfectly dry. Make\r\nthe skins up into a nice, neat package and sew it in a burlap. Don't\r\nroll skins; pack them flat. It is best to wrap them in paper before\r\nplacing them in the package. Always put a card, bearing your name and\r\naddress, inside of the package to help identify them, in case the\r\noutside tag gets torn off. Put two shipping tags on each package and\r\nfill them out with your name and address in the place reserved for it.\r\nWhen you give them into the hands of the express company, give their\r\ntrue value, as near as you can, and be sure that the agent marks the\r\nvaluation on the receipt. Then in case they are lost, you can hold the\r\nexpress company responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHabits of The Skunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkunks are found in all parts of the United States, with the exception\r\nof the mountainous district of the West. They occur again to the west of\r\nthe mountain ranges and also are found in most parts of Southern Canada.\r\nThey are found in the prairie country and in the hilly and mountainous\r\ndistricts of the East, and are at home in the \"wilds\" as well as in the\r\nthickly settled districts, however, they seem to thrive best in the\r\nfarming sections and especially if the country is of a hilly nature.\r\nTheir dens are located along the gravelly hillsides, quite often under\r\nthe roots of trees and stumps but in the prairie they den along the\r\nwashouts and creek banks. In thickly settled sections they frequently\r\nmake their home under houses and outbuildings, showing practically no\r\nfear of man and often appropriate the den of the woodchuck.\r\n\r\nThey are nocturnal animals and as a rule do not wander far from the den\r\nbut in the fall they travel farther, looking for a good den in which to\r\nspend the winter. Again, in early spring during the mating season, the\r\nmales travel considerably. While they are not a hibernating animal, they\r\nstay in their dens during cold weather, also when the snow is loose and\r\ndeep, but are sure to be out on the first nice night.\r\n\r\nThe mating season of this animal is in February and early March and the\r\nyoung are born mostly in May, although some will be born in April. There\r\nare usually from four to ten young in a litter but occasionally there\r\nwill be a larger number.\r\n\r\nThe value of a skunk skin depends mainly on its size and markings, they\r\nbeing graded by the buyers entirely by the amount of black fur,\r\nproviding, of course, that the skin is prime and well handled.\r\n\r\nBeing slow moving animals, they can not catch the more active animals\r\nand birds as do the other members of the weasel family and their food\r\nconsists mainly of mice, insects and grubs, also of the eggs and young\r\nof such birds as nest on the ground. They are very fond of poultry and\r\nfrequently visit the poultry houses, killing the young birds. They also\r\nfeed on carrion. When they can get it they will eat almost any kind of\r\nanimal food. Even in the wild state the skunk is not, strictly speaking,\r\na carnivorous animal as they will eat and in fact are fond of sweet corn\r\nwhen in a milky state, also sweet potatoes, melons and wild fruits. It\r\nappears that if the male skunk is not separated from the female at\r\nbreeding time, the female will kill the male, presumably to protect her\r\nyoung. And on the other hand the male will kill and eat the young if\r\ngiven the chance.\r\n\r\nRobert B. Phillips relates the following in H-T-T:\r\n\r\n  \"I wish to relate an experience with the lowly skunk. I found some\r\n  skunk signs near an old cave large enough for a small boy to creep in.\r\n  I set one trap near the main entrance and another one about fifteen\r\n  feet away both fastened to clogs. (I wish to state before I go farther\r\n  that the cave has a sickening sulphur smell and in the winter time, no\r\n  matter how deep the snow is elsewhere, you will not find any for about\r\n  three feet around the mouth of the cave.) Well I visited the traps the\r\n  next morning and upon arriving at the cave I saw two skunks about\r\n  twenty feet from the hole. One was eating at the hind quarters of the\r\n  other. Of course I thought they were both in my traps, but when about\r\n  forty feet away the victorious skunk saw me and started climbing an\r\n  embankment below the cave and I noticed he did not have a toe pincher\r\n  clinging to him. The skunk was only two feet from his dwelling when I\r\n  made a quick shot with a twenty two rifle. Of course I missed so I\r\n  knew he was gone for the time being. I went to the other one and found\r\n  him breathing his last. He had his entire tail, scent glands and the\r\n  meat all eaten off the bones at the junction of the hind legs and the\r\n  base of the backbone. In fact the hole in the body was so large that a\r\n  full sized baseball could be put into the abdomen and the skunk still\r\n  had a little life in him yet. Neither of them had thrown their scent.\r\n\r\n  \"Two days later I caught the other one, the largest male skunk I ever\r\n  caught. When I went there he was leisurely eating a rabbit he had\r\n  evidently caught. This happened in the beginning of December and both\r\n  were male skunks.\r\n\r\n  \"I know of another case where skunks turned Cannibalistic. This\r\n  happened to some young trappers who were in the habit of catching the\r\n  skunks in September and early October and keeping them until they were\r\n  prime. They had eight or nine in an old spring wagon. One morning he\r\n  went out to see them and found they had killed and eaten one of their\r\n  own number. There are a few of those fellows around here. They are\r\n  afraid another fellow might catch one or two of them.\r\n\r\n  \"One time I caught a skunk and I got quite near it kept on digging in\r\n  the leaves and every once in a while it would unearth a bug or insect\r\n  which it would promptly devour. Some people have an idea that a skunk\r\n  does nothing but steal chickens. This he does sometimes, but he makes\r\n  up for that by catching cut worms and other insects which spoil\r\n  thousands of dollars worth of crops annually. I have opened their\r\n  stomachs already and found centipedes and angle worms and lots of\r\n  beetles in them. Skunk also loves mice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding.\r\n\r\nEarl Williamson says:\r\n\r\n  \"I see in the H-T-T where persons have found skunk dens with nearly\r\n  all female skunks. My experience has been that in every den there is\r\n  one male and two or more females; twenty-two being the highest I have\r\n  ever heard of being taken from one den. The females and male den up\r\n  early while the rest travel around in nice weather and stay in any\r\n  hole in bad weather.\"\r\n\r\n  Says a Nebraska trapper: \"I have seen from 2 to 12 skunk in one den,\r\n  but never more than 1 male with a den of females. The males of a\r\n  litter seem to be forced to leave, only one remaining. The males so\r\n  treated den themselves individually at a distance from the herd of\r\n  females, returning in the spring. I have never known them to use their\r\n  odor in a fight among themselves, neither have I known them to make a\r\n  noise other than patting on the ground with their front feet.\"\r\n\r\nJ. M. Bray writes of Skunk Handling:\r\n\r\n  \"Norris Johnson, John K. Hallman and myself went into the ring and\r\n  started the performance by taking a pair each of live skunks by the\r\n  tails and holding them while the pictures were taken. Some of the\r\n  onlookers thought that was wonderful the way we handled those skunks.\r\n  Now, right here is where I want to say that you can do it just as well\r\n  as I can, if it is necessary for you to handle them. Go to them with a\r\n  quiet, but firm step; take a good hold on their tails and you can\r\n  carry them anywhere you want to. I have had a number of inquiries\r\n  whether my skunks were odorless. I will say they are not and it is not\r\n  necessary to make them odorless. If you use them gently you can have\r\n  them around for a year and no one would know that you had them. Some\r\n  ask, will black skunks breed all black, or will some breed back into\r\n  lower grades? It is a known fact that all animals will breed back\r\n  sometimes, but by having black you will breed black. But I find by\r\n  having black bucks and by having short stripe females (and no threes\r\n  or fours) your breed will be from fifty to seventy-five per cent\r\n  black, or No. 1.\r\n\r\n  \"Some have asked me what to feed them. Skunks will eat anything that a\r\n  cat or dog will eat, also various fruits, such as apples, pears,\r\n  persimmons, sweet corn or field corn (so long as the grains are soft).\r\n  Where you have a number you will have to figure on the feed. Skim milk\r\n  and stale bread, butchers' scraps, meat from dead animals, dead\r\n  chickens or anything of that nature, but it will be necessary to vary\r\n  their feed occasionally.\r\n\r\n  \"If you start with a pair or so for an experiment you do not need such\r\n  a large enclosure, but if you want to make a business of it, then I\r\n  would advise you not to be afraid to spend a few dollars on your pen\r\n  and the larger the lot the larger the pen. Don't crowd them or you\r\n  will be the loser.\"\r\n\r\nSkunk have no means of defense other than their scent, but this is\r\nsufficient in many cases and the majority of people will give them a\r\nwide berth. This scent is only used when alarmed or frightened and in\r\ncaptivity there is no trouble whatever from this source as they soon\r\nlearn that there is no occasion for alarm and become quite tame.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULLED FROM CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n  \"While trapping this last season I caught a skunk each night for three\r\n  nights in succession at the same den and the three brought $12.00\r\n  which I thought was pretty good for three skunks out of the same den.\r\n  I have caught as high as eight skunks in one day.\"--Lee Guthrie.\r\n\r\n  \"Skunks can be raised as easily as house cats, providing you have an\r\n  enclosure where they cannot dig out or climb over. For every hundred\r\n  old skunks, you should have an acre of ground enclosed.\r\n\r\n  \"I experimented for three years on a small scale. The first year I had\r\n  one male and three females. They brought forth fifteen young. One\r\n  died, plus four old ones, leaving eighteen--eleven females and seven\r\n  males. Five of the young graded as No. 2, balance star black.\r\n\r\n  \"The second year I started with twelve females and two males, bringing\r\n  forth forty-three young, plus fourteen old ones, total fifty-seven,\r\n  less three, which died, leaving a balance of fifty-four. I took out\r\n  seventeen males and five No. 2 females, leaving a balance of\r\n  thirty-two black ones.\"--I. M. Bray.\r\n\r\n  \"When cold weather comes the female dens up and with very few\r\n  exceptions does not stir until mating season which is in February.\r\n  Trappers will tell you that fully 90 per cent of the November,\r\n  December and January catch are males. After February 10, when the\r\n  running season is on the catch is largely females. At this season a\r\n  skunk tracked to its den and dug out has often resulted in as many as\r\n  eight or ten. These are mostly females.\"--H-T-T.\r\n\r\n  \"In regard to the habits of skunk in the Elkhorn River District,\r\n  Nebraska, will say they usually den in old badger holes, cleaning them\r\n  out in the fall, sometimes making a cavity in them 2x3 feet by 18\r\n  inches high, preferring hilltops, bluffs and slough banks as\r\n  situations. Sometimes they dig dens themselves, seldom going over 1\r\n  foot below the surface. The cavity is bedded 6 inches deep and the\r\n  hole about half filled with dry grass.\"--Nebraskan.\r\n\r\n  \"Farm readers, please don't kill the skunk during the summer when his\r\n  hide is worthless, because he got a chicken or two, but wait and take\r\n  his hide in the winter. It will more than pay for the chicken if you\r\n  really must rid your back woods of him, why not take him with box\r\n  traps and start a fur farm?\"--Peerless Bum.\r\n\r\n  \"John M. McCrary asks if we have ever heard a skunk make a noise. I\r\n  can answer that by saying positively yes. I have two male skunks\r\n  together in a pen and we have been awakened every night about 10\r\n  o'clock by their hideous squeals. They seem to be very congenial\r\n  during the daytime,\" says Harold Pugh.\r\n\r\n  Probably the sound you think so hideous is sweet music to the skunks.\r\n  However, it may be their war cry. If you would watch them and study\r\n  their habits, especially at night, you might make some valuable\r\n  contributions to our knowledge of skunk habits.\r\n\r\n  \"Why don't all of you fellows start a fur farm? It will be the most\r\n  paying business in the country pretty soon.\"--Albert C. Hancock.\r\n\r\n  \"The natural habits of the skunk is to live in holes in the ground,\r\n  rocks, trees, stumps, etc. Their food consists of mice, birds, bugs,\r\n  crickets, grasshoppers, bees, wasps, yellow jackets, angle worms,\r\n  seeds, berries, ground roots and barks.\"--Bureau of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nBeyond all doubt the skunk has been given more consideration by raisers\r\nof fur-bearers than any other animal, with the exception of the fox.\r\nThere are many who have tried raising these animals with more or less\r\nsuccess and where the experimenters have used good judgment and have\r\ngiven the subject all of the attention it deserves, they have been\r\nreasonably successful. Most of these people have started in on a small\r\nscale, having perhaps only a dozen or two of skunks to start with; in\r\nfact nowhere has the business been carried on as extensively as some\r\nnewspaper articles would lead one to believe; the majority of these\r\nparties having at the most only two or three hundred animals.\r\n\r\nIt is the smaller experimenters, in other words those who have begun on\r\na small scale, who have been most successful. They are for the most part\r\nfarmers who had even before venturing into the business a fair knowledge\r\nof the nature and habits of the skunk and therefore were more qualified\r\nfor making the business a successful one. Farmers naturally take an\r\ninterest in all nature and are most likely to give the proper amount of\r\nattention to the animals, also learn their habits readily and act\r\naccordingly and these qualities are absolutely necessary for the\r\nsuccessful raising of all fur-bearing animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Information.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most successful stock breeders are those who make a special study of\r\ntheir animals and take a great interest in them and those who do not are\r\nalmost certain to fail and really deserve failure. If so much care is\r\nnecessary in breeding domestic animals, how much more important the care\r\nin handling the wild creatures, knowing so little of them as the average\r\nman does. But even handicapped by lack of knowledge the experimenters\r\nhave been fairly successful from the start if they were right men for\r\nthe business. Without exception they all report that the animals breed\r\nwell in captivity and are easily kept; in a short time becoming quite\r\ntame and losing their fear of man.\r\n\r\nThe skunk is an animal which is despised and feared by many people\r\nbecause of its readiness to make use of its powerful scent, the only\r\nmeans of defense with which nature has provided it, but it is only when\r\nfrightened that it uses this scent and once they have become tame and\r\nlearn that they will not be harmed they are practically harmless. We\r\nwill say, however, to those who are afraid of the scent, do not attempt\r\nto raise skunks, but devote your time to some other calling for which\r\nyou are more fitted. But if you want to make clean money, raise skunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoving the Scent Sacs.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the scent glands may be removed from the young animals\r\nand we can see no reason why this should have any effect on their\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe operation is easily performed and if done when the skunks are very\r\nyoung, about the time they first open their eyes, they are seldom harmed\r\nby it. The operator should provide himself with an old bag, and seated\r\non a low bench with the bag between his knees should place the animal in\r\nthe bag, leaving only the hind quarters uncovered. With a small, sharp\r\nknife make a ¼ or 3/8-inch incision over the gland, and with an awl\r\nlift up on the gland, which at that age will be about the size of a\r\ncranberry, at the same time pressing down gently on the surrounding\r\ntissue with the flat side of the knife. The gland will lift up readily.\r\nThen holding it with the awl, cut it through the center, allowing the\r\nremaining half to return to place. The reason the entire gland is not\r\nremoved is that it is firmly united to the rectum and the animal is\r\nlikely to be seriously injured if one attempts to remove the entire\r\ngland. All of the scent, and only half of the gland is necessary.\r\nFollowing is a more detail description of the operation of removing the\r\nscent sac:\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of The Scent Glands of The Skunk.\r\n\r\nThe annal glands which are possessed also by other members of the weasel\r\nfamily are developed in the skunk to such a wonderful degree as to\r\nconstitute an effective means of defense. They are not related in any\r\nway to the genito-urinary system either in location or function. They\r\nare the same in both sexes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Laymon and Assistant Removing the Scent Sac.]\r\n\r\nThe scent fluid which is the special secretion of these glands is\r\ncontained in two sacs located beneath the skin, one on each side of the\r\nvent. Each sac is embedded in a powerful, gizzard-like, muscular\r\nenvelope the contraction of which discharges the scent fluid. Fig. 1 and\r\nFig. 2 show general location and form.\r\n\r\nWithin the rectum just beyond the sphincter muscle which ordinarily\r\nkeeps the vent closed are two papillae from which the scent is\r\ndischarged. Each papilla is connected with one of the scent sacs by a\r\ndischarge duct.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the discharge papillae are not visible but when the skunk\r\ndischarges the scent fluid the tail is raised and doubled close along\r\nthe back, the vent is relaxed and turned outward to such an extent that\r\nthe pappillae becomes external and from them the scent is discharged and\r\ndirected with remarkable accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe skunk takes great care not to get any of the scent on its tail or\r\nfur and the slightly skunky odor which fur garments sometimes have is\r\nusually the result of carelessness in killing or skinning the animal. To\r\nkill without scent the backbone should be broken by a quick blow or the\r\nskunk should be drowned.\r\n\r\nWhen held by the tail with head hanging down and with tail and backbone\r\nin a straight line the skunk cannot control the muscles which evolve the\r\nrectum and discharge the scent. Care must be taken that the skunk does\r\nnot twist or climb upward. It should be held low to keep its interest\r\ncentered on the ground which it will strive to reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Removing the Scent Sacs From Live Skunks\r\nWithout the Escape of Any of the Scent Fluid.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1, X-RAY OF SCENT SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nThis operation is simple and may be readily learned by anyone who will\r\nfollow these instructions carefully. No anaesthetic is needed.\r\n\r\n1. The beginner should dress in old clothes or overalls and as a\r\nprecaution should wear goggles to protect the eyes in case of accident.\r\nAn old hat or a paper sack worn as a cap will protect the hair. With\r\nthese safeguards the learner feels perfectly at ease and therefore the\r\nchance of accident is much lessened while acquiring proficiency.\r\n\r\n2. A heavy plank supported on two wooden buckets makes a good\r\noperating table. Straddling this plank the operator and his assistant\r\nsit facing each other.\r\n\r\n3. The proper instruments are as follows:\r\n\r\n    1 nickel plated scalpel (knife).\r\n    1 nickel plated tenaculum (hook).\r\n    1 nickel plated sound probe (probe).\r\n    1 pair nickel plated special extracting forceps.\r\n    1 pair nickel plated automatic clamping forceps.\r\n    2 pair goggles (worn only by beginners as safeguard).\r\n\r\n4. Several pieces of clean white cloth about three inches square\r\nshould be provided.\r\n\r\n5. The instruments should be boiled about ten minutes in clear water\r\nto insure cleanliness. During the operation they should be kept in a\r\nsaucer containing a five per cent solution of carbolic acid which may be\r\nplaced on a box within easy reach of the operator's right hand.\r\n\r\n6. The operator first takes his seat and spreads a gunny-sack or\r\nburlap across the plank just in front of him.\r\n\r\n7. The assistant then brings the skunk carrying it by the tail with\r\nhis right hand. His left hand should grasp the nape of the neck to help\r\nkeep the head down for the back-bone and tail must at all times be kept\r\nin a straight line.\r\n\r\n8. The assistant now, by means of his hold on the nape of the neck\r\nbrings the skunk into a horizontal position (keeping the backbone and\r\ntail in a straight line) and lays it belly downward on the gunny-sack\r\nwith head toward the operator.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2, SECTIONAL VIEW OF SCENT SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n  A--Scent Sac               H--Original Incision\r\n  B--Muscular Envelope       I--Rectum\r\n  C--Discharge Duct          K--Sphincter Muscle Encircling Vent\r\n  D--Discharge Papilla       L--Scent Sac Pushing Through Incision\r\n  E--Vent\r\n  F--Wall of Rectum\r\n  G--Cut to Sever Duct]\r\n\r\n9. The operator wraps the gunny-sack snugly about the skunk while the\r\nassistant releases his hold on the nape of the neck.\r\n\r\n10. The assistant now immediately places the forefinger of his left\r\nhand with light pressure over the vent, while the operator proceeds to\r\nturn the skunk on its back keeping the gunny-sack wrapped firmly about\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\n11. Now only the tail and butt of the skunk are exposed to view. The\r\ngunny-sack covers all four feet and head so there can be no scratching\r\nor biting.\r\n\r\n12. The operator brings his knees together over the plank and thereby\r\nholds the skunk. This enables him to have both hands free.\r\n\r\n13. The operator now relieves the assistant by placing the fore-finger\r\nof his own left hand over the vent. With the thumb of the same hand he\r\nlocates the scent gland just to the right of the vent. The gland is\r\neasily recognized as feeling hard and round like a marble beneath the\r\nskin abreast of the vent, neither forward nor backward from the vent.\r\n\r\n14. Having the thumb and fore-finger about an inch and a quarter apart\r\nthe operator now squeezes the gland tight enough to draw the skin firmly\r\nover it. His right hand is free.\r\n\r\n15. With a piece of cloth dipped in the carbolic solution he moistens\r\nthe fur and skin held between his thumb and finger.\r\n\r\n16. With the scalpel, starting at least three-eights of an inch from\r\nthe vent so as not to injure the sphincter muscle which encircles the\r\nvent, the operator makes an incision through the skin about five-eighths\r\nof an inch long directly over the center of the scent gland and in a\r\nstraight line with the vent, as shown at H in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n17. The incision is now carefully deepened until the firm, gizzard-like\r\nenvelope in which the sac lies is reached. The beginner is likely to\r\nmistake this firm, muscular envelope for the sac itself because the\r\nenvelope is lighter in color than the tissues previously cut.\r\n\r\n18. He now proceeds more gradually to cut through the muscular\r\nenvelope as shown at H in Fig. 2, taking light strokes with the scalpel\r\nand cutting only a slight depth each time.\r\n\r\n19. If the muscular envelope cannot be held firmly enough by the\r\npressure of thumb and finger so the knife will cut well the muscle may\r\nbe hooked with the tenaculum and thus held by the assistant while the\r\noperator cuts.\r\n\r\n20. Soon a small white bead appears in the bottom of the incision as\r\nshown at L in Fig. 2. There is no mistaking this as it is the white sac\r\nitself pushing through a very small opening which has been made through\r\nthe envelope.\r\n\r\n21. This opening is now carefully increased by turning the dull side\r\nof the scalpel toward the protruding sac and cutting away from it, first\r\non one side and then on the other.\r\n\r\n22. The sac keeps pushing outward more and more until it is about the\r\nsize of a pea. The cutting is then stopped.\r\n\r\n23. Now by means of the extracting forceps the sac is gradually lifted\r\nby raising it a little on one side and then on the other. The object is\r\nto work the sac through the small opening without tearing it by too\r\nviolent a pull and without lacerating it by gripping too hard with the\r\nforceps. The proper way is to grasp lightly and pull gently here and\r\nthere at its base.\r\n\r\n24. When half the sac has been worked through the opening the sac\r\nsuddenly pops up out of the gizzard-like envelope.\r\n\r\n25. The sac is now lifted carefully by the extracting forceps to see\r\nthat it is all clear and attached only by the discharge duct.\r\n\r\n26. If any slight muscular tissue is found clinging to the sac it may\r\nbe torn away with the sound or tenaculum or carefully cut with the\r\nscalpel.\r\n\r\n27. The duct, which alone holds the sac, is now clamped in the\r\nautomatic forceps as near the sac as feasible as shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n28. The assistant now holds these forceps and thus supports the sac so\r\nthe operator can see the duct clearly.\r\n\r\n29. The operator then carefully examines the duct preparatory to\r\ncutting it. He must be very sure not to cut it too close to the rectum\r\nor he will cut a round hole in the rectal wall because even a slight\r\npull on the duct draws the discharge papilla outward and brings with it\r\nthe wall of the rectum wrapped about the papilla so as to look like a\r\ncontinuation of the duct. See C, Figs 1, 2, 3.\r\n\r\n30. By feeling carefully with the sound or the dull side of the\r\nscalpel the end of the papilla nearest the sac is readily discerned by\r\nits firmness or hardness.\r\n\r\n31. The duct is now severed with the scalpel at a point a little way\r\nfrom the papilla as shown at G in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n32. The sac is now held free in the clamping forceps and not a\r\nparticle of the scent fluid has escaped.\r\n\r\n33. The operator then proceeds in the same manner to locate and remove\r\nthe second sac.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3. SAC COMPLETELY WITHDRAWN.\r\n\r\n  A--Scent sac                  F--Wall of Rectum\r\n  B--Muscular Envelope          G--Cut to Sever Duct\r\n  C--Discharge Duct             H--Incision to Expose Sac\r\n  D--Discharge Papilla          I--Rectum\r\n  E--Vent (Rectum)              J--Tail]\r\n\r\n34. The incisions should be wiped out with a piece of cloth with\r\ncarbolic solution and never need any further attention. In a few days\r\nnot even the scars can be found.\r\n\r\n35. The operation is performed most easily when the animal is not too\r\nold or fat. Any time from one-third to two-thirds growth is a good age\r\nfor this work.\r\n\r\n36. With a little practice the complete operation of removing both\r\nscent sacs should not take over five minutes or skunks may be handled at\r\nrate of ten or twelve per hour.\r\n\r\nThe removing of the scent sac has increased the value of No. Four skunk.\r\nMany are sold as pets, and others used for advertising purposes. We do\r\nnot go to the trouble of removing the sac on animals we know we are\r\ngoing to kill soon. There is no danger of scenting when the skunk is\r\ncarried suspended by the tail.\r\n\r\nThose who have failed in skunk raising were for the most part people who\r\nknew nothing regarding the habits of the animal and its care when in\r\ncaptivity. They were men with capital, who began on a large scale\r\nexpecting to make a fortune in a short time, but in this they were\r\nmistaken, for many of them lost all that they invested. These parties\r\nhave had trouble from the older animals killing and eating the young,\r\nalso depradations of owls, but mainly from the first reason. It is our\r\nopinion that this cannibalistic tendency is caused by improper feeding,\r\nas those parties who have used care in that respect have had no trouble\r\n=whatever=.\r\n\r\nTo those who are thinking of embarking in the business of skunk farming,\r\nwe would say--start on a small scale with only a small number of\r\nanimals, say two dozen females and six males. Give them every possible\r\nattention and study them under all conditions. Do not expect to make a\r\nfortune in a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaws Affecting Fur Farming.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent questions that we are called upon to answer is\r\n\"Will the laws of this state allow of keeping fur-bearing animals in\r\ncaptivity?\" This question has caused considerable trouble, for in states\r\nwhere fur-bearers are protected a part of the year, it is usually\r\nconsidered unlawful to have the live animals in possession during closed\r\nseason, but not always so.\r\n\r\nOnly one state, namely New York, has laws making it a misdemeanor to\r\nhave protected fur-bearing animals in possession during closed season.\r\nIn that state it surely would be unlawful to raise skunks, for the law,\r\nafter giving the open season on these animals says: \"They shall not be\r\npossessed or killed at any other time.\" It is our opinion that the\r\nfur-farmer would not get into any trouble with the law, in any state\r\nother than New York, if he would kill the captive animals only during\r\nthe open season for the said animals, since the game laws of no other\r\nstate say that you may not have the animals in possession. Still there\r\nare fur farms in the state of New York.\r\n\r\nYou are obliged to comply with rules and regulations of the Conservation\r\nCommission of New York. You should write to this commission at Albany,\r\nNew York, and get their instructions and permission. Fur farming laws\r\nand game laws covering this subject are confused and unsatisfactory. Fur\r\nfarmers are likely to find that much depends on the disposition of local\r\ngame protectors, and should get in touch with them and with the state\r\nauthorities, especially a state like New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nDye Markings to Denote Sex--Toe Clipping to Denote Age.\r\n\r\nWe have installed what we consider a very handy system of skunk labeling\r\non our farm. For instance we mark the male skunk with a red mark\r\nperpendicularly across the white markings in the head. If he is\r\n\"altered,\" this mark becomes a cross. With the female it is\r\nblue mark--if \"altered,\" the mark becomes a cross. To denote the age we\r\nsimply clip a claw each year at a certain time. The unclipped animal is\r\nless than a year old. We seldom keep them over five years as breeders.\r\nUsually sell the pelts during the fourth year. The system seems to work\r\nout very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Simple Fur Press.\r\n\r\nTake a box with a bottom the size you wish the bottom of your bale of\r\nfurs to be and turn it bottom side up on the floor near the wall. Then\r\nspread a piece of burlap over it large enough to hang over the edges a\r\nlittle all the way around. Then lay on a piece of heavy brown paper\r\nabout the size of the burlap. Then lay on your furs in a flat, square\r\npile, the same shape as the top of the box. It is a good plan to brush\r\nthe hair all out straight and smooth as you lay them on. Lay them on\r\nuntil you have them thick enough so that when pressed down they will be\r\nas thick as you want your bale. Then lay on another piece of paper and\r\nburlap about the size of the ones on the bottom.\r\n\r\nThen lay some short pieces of board crosswise under your lever. Then\r\nnail a cleat to the wall the same distance from the floor that the top\r\nof your bale will be when pressed. Then take a piece of good solid board\r\nor anything handy that may be used as a lever and lay across the top of\r\nthe bale, catching one end under the cleat on the wall and pry it down\r\nand weight it or have some one hold it for you while you fold the edges\r\nof the paper together smoothly and the burlap in the same way, folding\r\nthe corners in neatly. Now you can sew these edges together with some\r\ngood stout cord and release your lever, tie on your shipping tags and\r\nyou will have a neat secure bundle, all ready for shipment. The bundle\r\nmay be strengthened by putting a good stout cord around it lengthwise\r\nand crosswise twice. This makes something to get hold of when handling\r\nit.--L. Dewey.\r\n\r\n\r\nLive Skunks Can be Shipped by Express.\r\n\r\nSkunk skins or live skunk will not be carried by parcels post. Live\r\nskunk in the past have been transported by the express companies usually\r\nat regular merchandise rates, and the occasional shipment of these\r\nanimals when well caged and protected did not arouse any great comment.\r\n\r\nOwing to damage incurred, on April 1, 1913, the express companies took\r\nconcerted action and passed a joint and official amendment with the\r\nconcurrence of the Interstate Commerce Commission, reading as follows:\r\n\"SKUNKS--Refuse.\" This made it impossible to ship live skunks by express\r\nafter that date. There was naturally a protest to the express companies\r\nby skunk breeders, and by those accustomed to shipping live skunks. The\r\nexpress companies finally agreed, however, to accept for shipment skunks\r\nfrom which the oval glands had been removed. The ruling on skunks was\r\ntherefore with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nchanged to read, effective May 20, 1913, as follows: \"Skunks--Refuse,\r\nunless scent sacs are removed.\"\r\n\r\nAll the express companies concur in this ruling, even the Canadian\r\nCompanies. This means that shipments can be made between all points in\r\nthe United States or Canada. The removal of the scent sacs is easiest at\r\nthe age of five weeks, although it can be done at any time. It does not\r\nseem to injure the skunks in any way or to interfere with their breeding.\r\n\r\nIn shipping skunks from the United States to Canada there is no duty,\r\nbut, in shipping from Canada to the United States the duty is 20% of the\r\ninvoice price.\r\n\r\nAt the time of shipment, write a letter to the fur company, that you are\r\nshipping to, advising them of the shipment, and telling how you are\r\nsending the furs, and just how many and what kind of furs you are\r\nsending. If you follow these instructions, you will seldom have any\r\ncause for complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nQuestions and Answers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we are asked certain questions so often we are pleased to give below\r\nanswers to those most frequently received:\r\n\r\n\"=What is The Best Way For Me to Start Raising Skunks for Fur?=\" Start\r\nwith a few and increase the number as you can care for them. Dig out or\r\ncapture a couple of litters this spring. Mate the males of one litter\r\nwith the females of the other litter. There are usually eight to ten\r\nyoung in a litter. The old skunks mate about March 1st and the young are\r\nborn about May 1st. Never inbreed; that is, do not mate related animals.\r\nFurs are becoming scarcer and prices are continually advancing. Those\r\nwho start early in this industry will make the most money.\r\n\r\n\"=How Can I Breed For Black Skunks?=\" Each year save your largest and\r\nblackest skunks to breed from. Market the skins of all the rest when\r\nprime. Be always on the lookout for blacker specimens, especially males.\r\nYou can mate one black male to four or five females and even if the\r\nfemales are not entirely black there will be a good percentage of black\r\namong the young.\r\n\r\n\"=What Should I Feed Skunks?=\" Skunks in confinement will eat meat of\r\nany kind, bread, milk, whether sweet or sour, many sweet fruits, green\r\ncorn and some other vegetables. Table leavings from hotels, waste from\r\nslaughter-houses, dead farm stock or dead chickens are all eaten readily\r\nand take the place of the beetles, grubs and mice which the skunk lives\r\non when free. Do not give decayed food. Supply fresh water regularly.\r\n\r\n\"=I Live in Town; Can I keep Skunks Without The Scent Disturbing My\r\nNeighbors?=\" Yes. You can remove the scent sacs from your animals. This\r\nis very easy to do and the skunks do not mind it at all. They do not\r\nlose a meal. After the scent sacs are removed they can never scent\r\nagain. Your neighbors will not know you are raising skunks unless you\r\ntell them.\r\n\r\n\"=How Long Does it Take to Remove The Scent Sacs?=\" With a little\r\npractice you can remove the scent sacs and make a skunk forever\r\nscentless in four or five minutes, or at the rate of 75 to 100 skunks\r\nper day.\r\n\r\n\"=Does Any of The Scent Fluid Escape When Removing The Scent Sacs?=\" Not\r\nwith our method. With proper instruments you can remove the scent sacs\r\ncompletely without spilling a drop of the scent fluid.\r\n\r\n\"=How Can a Skunk Be Tamed?=\" The skunk is naturally gentle and not much\r\nafraid of people. When the scent sacs have been removed from a young\r\nskunk it will be found at once quite tame and may be carried about in\r\nyour arms like a kitten. If it is handled frequently it will grow up\r\nvery tame, will come when called and will eat from the hand.\r\n\r\n\"=Are The Scent Sacs The Same in Both Sexes?=\" Yes, they are the same in\r\nboth sexes. They open into the rectum and are not related in any way to\r\nthe reproductive or urinary systems. The scent fluid is not the urine as\r\nmany people imagine.\r\n\r\n\"=What Do You Pay For Black Skunks?=\" We pay from $5 to $15 each for\r\ngrade AAA according to time of year, locality and size. The scent sacs\r\nmust be removed. We pay express charges on all skunks which we buy. If\r\nyou have any choice specimens you wish to sell write us full description\r\nand we will gladly make you quotation. We want 500 skunk now.\r\n\r\n\"=What is The Best Age For Removing The Scent Sacs?=\" This work can be\r\ndone at any age easily unless the skunk is very fat. We strongly\r\nrecommend that you begin on young skunks in the spring, any time after\r\nthe eyes are open. The young skunks are easily weaned. They readily take\r\nmilk or bread and milk and do not need the mother. Do not let them run\r\nwith old skunk.\r\n\r\n\"=What Kind of Fencing Do I Need For Skunks?=\" Poultry netting 2 to 3\r\nfeet in the ground and 6 feet above ground makes the cheapest fence. To\r\nprevent climbing out make at the top an over-hang of netting 12 or 18\r\ninches wide or place a strip of tin about 18 inches wide on the inside\r\nof the fence near the top to make it smooth and slippery. The netting\r\nshould be 1½-inch mesh for the main yard (for adults) and 1-inch mesh\r\nfor the breeding pens. The best fencing is made from galvanized tin or\r\ngalvanized iron, in our opinion. Read chapter on \"Enclosures.\"\r\n\r\n\"=How do you grade Skunk?=\" Personally I think the eastern assortment\r\nbest; which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Eastern Assortment. The average size, ordinary color of fur, prime or\r\nunprime pelt is considered, then graded to No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 or No. 4\r\ngrade. On skunk for illustration: the short shoulder stripe is graded as\r\nNo. 1 when prime and full size, the object of this assortment is as few\r\ngrades as possible, prices quoted will not permit of as high quotations\r\nas firms quoting Western Assortment, but will figure equally as much if\r\nnot more, in dollars and cents.\"\r\n\r\nThe Western Assortment is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Western Assortment. Each pelt is graded to its individual value, first\r\ncolor, then size, primeness, etc., as high as thirty grades are used;\r\nskunk for instance is graded for black, short narrow and broad, then as\r\nto size and shade and color, etc., each commanding a different value. A\r\nfirm using this assortment can quote most any price if they desire and\r\nhave their goods just as cheap, if not cheaper, than those using eastern\r\nassortment only.\"\r\n\r\n\"=Where can I sell skunk grease and what does it sell at?=\" There is a\r\nsmall demand for animal oils and grease, but the markets shift from\r\npoint to point. You will have to get in touch with these markets through\r\ndrug stores and doctors who know addresses of chemists and dealers in\r\ndrugs. There are many by-products of the trap line which trappers should\r\nstudy, to see if they could not work them into commercial lines. Animal\r\noils are one of these by-products. I think that skunk oil, under a fancy\r\nname, scented with a little musk or perfume, would find ready sale for\r\nchapped hands, sunburn, etc. These oils are usually wasted now. There\r\nis an opening for a dealer in animal oils if he knows the users.\r\n\r\n\"=When is the best time to trap Skunk?=\" In cold weather, when\r\nfur-bearers den up and hibernate, trappers smoke out more animals in one\r\nday than they can take in traps in a month; besides, they get prime fur\r\nworth the most money. Still we do not advocate this method. They should\r\nbe captured alive for breeding purposes.\r\n\r\n\"=What do you consider a good scent for skunk?=\" Anise oil, as a rule,\r\nis best for skunks. Apples are good skunk bait and meats also are good.\r\n\r\n\"=Can you tell me the best method of removing skunks from their dens?=\"\r\nIt depends on the den. Dig 'em outs, who use shovels, or dynamite, or\r\ncrowbars, destroy the dens. There are bellows and smoke blowers for\r\nsmoking out the occupants of dens, and the makers would tell you the\r\nbest ways. However, as a sporting and financial proposition, you would\r\nbetter get your skunks by straight trapping or snaring, instead of\r\nkilling off whole families as you would do raiding dens. When you track\r\na skunk to its hole, use the smoker, but don't hog the fur. Leave\r\nbreeding stock for another year.\r\n\r\n\"=Is it advisable to flesh and scrape skunk hides down to white skin\r\nbefore hanging up to dry? Can you tell me why dealers do not want fur\r\nhides salted, say, salted slightly, and if any, what detriment it is to\r\nthem?=\" The clean skin is best. All fat and flesh should be removed,\r\ncare being taken not to break into the skin, nor should the skin be\r\n\"worked\" or drawn too much, in the process. Of course, skins may be\r\ncleaned on the boards. The salt dries the skin and hardens it, making it\r\nbrittle and likely to crack. Its action on the skin is not neutralized,\r\nas in the tanning processes by other chemicals. Even a little salt\r\nchanges the skin, absorbing the moisture and changing the chemical\r\nconstituents of the hide. The best way to preserve fur skins--salt is\r\nsimply to prevent decay--is to clean the skins carefully and stretch on\r\nframes or boards, and hang them in a cool, dry, sheltered place where\r\nrodents and insects cannot get them. Of course, pelts should not be left\r\ntoo long on the stretchers--a few days--and too much care cannot be\r\ntaken of them.\r\n\r\n\"=Does it spoil fur keeping it through the summer if kept moth proof and\r\nin a cool place?=\" Not if it is properly dried and protected from moths.\r\nSome of my friends keep their late catches of fur in perfectly tight\r\npaper bags, with tobacco, holding them over for the early winter or\r\nbefore-the-London-sales prices. A big slump in the fur market is often\r\nmet this way on certain kinds of fur by trappers, but the fur must be\r\nproperly dried and carefully stored away from insects, mice, etc.\r\n\r\n\"=Will it do to breed to the same male continually?=\" We do not advise\r\nit. Young stock from foreign pens should be constantly added to improve\r\nthe grade. In breeding should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"=How can live Skunks be shipped?=\" If the scent sacs have been removed\r\nyou can ship a skunk by express in a box with wire netting over the\r\nopening. If the distance is great, supply plenty of dog biscuit or dry\r\nbread and a dish for milk. Mark on box, \"Please give milk and water.\" If\r\nthe weather is cold make a nest of straw in one end of box.\r\n\r\n\"=Can I make any money by removing the scent sacs from Skunks?=\" Yes,\r\nyou should be able to sell the first skunk you operate on, even if\r\nstriped, for at least $5 to someone who would like it as a pet or as a\r\ncuriosity. A tame skunk will draw big crowds when placed in a store\r\nwindow for advertising purposes. Amusement Parks are glad to get them.\r\nMoney can be made by selling tame skunks or by operating for other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"=What diseases are common to the skunk?=\" They are practically a\r\ndiseaseless animal. True they are troubled with lice when kept too\r\nclosely confined and fed too much spoiled meat. Any common poultry\r\npowder which will destroy poultry lice will destroy skunk lice. Change\r\ndens and allow the animal to burrow in gravelly earth. Meat diet\r\nsometimes causes scurvy. This can be avoided by feeding a variety of\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\n\"=How do you prevent infection after removing the scent sac?=\" First\r\nwash the parts with a weak carbolic solution taking care not to allow\r\nthe solution to enter the rectum, or better still paint the glands with\r\niodine before operating. Rub over the incision a composition of\r\nturpentine and lard. This will repel flies.\r\n\r\n\"=What do you do with the young after weaning?=\" We allow the female to\r\nrange, and also the young, but in separate pens. Do not make the mistake\r\nof allowing the young ones to range with aged males until they are able\r\nto protect themselves from injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS WITH WHICH TO REMOVE SCENT SACS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many persons have written us to know if we handle instruments\r\nsuitable to perform the operation of removing the scent sac, that we\r\nhave consented to make a selection.\r\n\r\nThe proper instruments are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1 nickel plated scalpel (knife).\r\n  1 nickel plated tenaculum (hook).\r\n  1 nickel plated sound probe (probe).\r\n  1 pair nickel plated special extracting forceps.\r\n  1 pair nickel plated automatic clamping forceps.\r\n  2 pair goggles (worn only by beginners as safeguard\r\n    against scent fluid unexpectedly entering\r\n    the eyes).\r\n\r\nThese tools are of a high grade of steel and nickel plated to guard\r\nagainst rust. A very handy and desirable set of instruments. One set (as\r\nabove) packed securely in box, sent by prepaid parcels post for only\r\n$3.00. The most satisfactory set of instruments on the market. Your\r\norder solicited.\r\n\r\n=References: Exchange Bank of Spencer.=\r\n\r\nTHE LAYMON FUR FARM CO.\r\nSPENCER    INDIANA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PEN OF WHITE RUNNERS AS BRED AND RAISED BY JOHN F.\r\n   CRANE, SPENCER, INDIANA.\r\n\r\n   If you want to start right, with foundation stock, or eggs from as\r\n   good as there is in the country, write me--same prices at all times\r\n   for stock and eggs--134 acres devoted to raising poultry, fruit and\r\n   ponies--Breeder of White Indian Runners, Fawn and White Runners--\r\n   White Wyandottes and Barred Rocks.
