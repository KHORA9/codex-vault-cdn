PAYNE, ESQ., AND SIDNEY J. HERRTAGE, ESQ., B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\nPUBLISHED FOR THE ENGLISH DIALECT SOCIETY\r\nBY TRÜBNER & CO., 57 AND 59, LUDGATE HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile for all who take an interest in the customs and life of our\r\nancestors Tusser's writings must always possess considerable interest,\r\nto the Members of the English Dialect Society they are especially\r\nvaluable for the large number of dialectic words and forms which they\r\ncontain. The Glossary has therefore been made very full, possibly,\r\nin the opinion of some, too full; but as this is the most important\r\nportion of the work to the Society, I have thought it better to err, if\r\nat all, on the right side.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the preparation of this Edition a few words may be\r\nnecessary. As the Members of the Society are aware, the task was\r\noriginally undertaken by Mr. W. Payne. Ill-health unfortunately\r\nprevented him from carrying the work to a completion, but to him the\r\nSociety is indebted for the supervision of the reprint of the Edition\r\nof 1580, which he collated most carefully with the editions of 1557 and\r\n1577, and to which he added several pieces from those editions, thus\r\nmaking the present reprint more complete than any yet published. Mr.\r\nPayne also compiled a very complete Index of Words, which has been of\r\ngreat assistance to me for purposes of reference, and in preparing the\r\nGlossary. The notes also from Tusser Redivivus (marked T.R.) were for\r\nthe most part extracted by Mr. Payne.\r\n\r\nA reprint of the First Edition of 1557 was not included in the original\r\nprogramme, but after the work came into my hands an opportunity was\r\npresented through the kindness of Mr. F. J. Furnivall, who lent for the\r\npurpose his copy of the reprint of 1810, of exhibiting the work in its\r\noriginal form of \"One hundreth Points\" side by side with the extended\r\nedition of 1580, the last which had the benefit of the author's\r\nsupervision. The proof-sheets have been collated with the unique copy\r\nin the British Museum by Miss Toulmin-Smith, to whom I return my thanks\r\nfor her kindness, and the correctness of the reprint may consequently\r\nbe relied on. From Mr. F. J. Furnivall I have received numerous hints,\r\nand much valuable help, while to Mr. J. Britten, F.L.S., I am indebted\r\nfor his kindness in revising and supplementing the notes on the Plants\r\nnamed in Tusser. But my chief obligations are due to the Rev. W. W.\r\nSkeat, whose uniform kindness has considerably lightened my labours,\r\nand from whom both directly and indirectly (through the notes in his\r\nnumerous publications), but more particularly in his noble edition of\r\nPiers Plowman, I have derived the greatest assistance.\r\n\r\nS. J. H.\r\n\r\nMay 14th, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: The original print edition has both page footnotes\r\nand an end section of 'Notes and Illustrations.' In this digital edition,\r\nthe page footnotes are grouped at the end of each chapter and renumbered\r\naccordingly: [1], [[2], etc. References to the endnotes are numbered [E1],\r\n[E2], etc. The html version also links words in the main text to their\r\nreference points in the Glossary.\r\n\r\nThe 'Erratum' on p. xxxii of the print edition has been silently corrected\r\nwithin the text, and the 'Additional Notes' on p. 317 are now incorporated\r\nwithin the preceding 'Notes and Illustrations.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                PAGE\r\n\r\n     PREFACE                                                    v\r\n\r\n     BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE AUTHOR                          xi\r\n\r\n     TUSSER'S WILL                                              xxix\r\n\r\n\r\n     Fiue hundred pointes of good husbandrie                    1\r\n\r\n     A lesson how to confer euery abstract with his month, &c.  2\r\n\r\n     A Table of the Pointes of Husbandrie                       3\r\n\r\n1.

The exact date of his birth\r\nis uncertain, Warton[2] placing it in 1523, and Dr. Mavor in 1515, in\r\nwhich he is supported by the inscription on the mural tablet erected to\r\nthe memory of Tusser in the church of Manningtree, where he is stated\r\nto have been sixty-five years of age at the time of his death, which\r\ntook place in 1580.\r\n\r\nTusser, however, appears to have been elected to King's College,\r\nCambridge, in 1543, and as he would have become ineligible at nineteen,\r\nhis birth cannot have taken place earlier than 1523, and, most\r\nprobably, did not take place before 1524 or 1525.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the pedigree recorded by his nephew, John Tusser, the\r\nson of his eldest brother Clement, at the Herald's Visitation of Essex\r\nin 1570, which is the only record we have of the family, that \"William\r\nTusser, the father, had five sons, Clement, Andrew, John, THOMAS,\r\nand William, and four daughters; the marriages of the daughters are\r\nset down, but no wives assigned to the sons, except to Clement, who\r\nmarried Ursula Petts, and had issue John (who entered the pedigree),\r\nEdward, and Jane, all three unmarried in 1570. The mother of THOMAS was\r\n[Isabella], a daughter of Thomas Smith, of Rivenhall, in Essex, Esq.,\r\nwhose elder brother, Hugh, was ancestor of Smith, Lord Carrington (not\r\nthe present lord), sister of Sir Clement Smith, who married a sister of\r\nthe Protector Somerset, and first cousin of Sir John Smith, one of the\r\nBarons of the Exchequer in the reign of Edward the Sixth. This match\r\nwith Smith I take to have been the chief foundation of gentility in the\r\nTussers, for I can find no traces of them or their arms before this\r\nconnexion.\"[3]\r\n\r\nAt a very early age, and notwithstanding his mother's tears and\r\nentreaties, he was placed by his father as a singing-boy in the\r\nCollegiate Chapel of the Castle of Wallingford, in Berkshire, which,\r\naccording to Warton,[4] consisted of a dean, six prebendaries, six\r\nclerks, and four choristers, and was dissolved in 1549. He has himself\r\nrecorded[5] in his homely and quaint style the hardships which he had\r\nto endure at this school, the bare robes, the college fare, the stale\r\nbread, and the penny ale. The excellence of his voice appears to have\r\nattracted the notice of some of those persons to whom at that time\r\n\"placards\" or commissions were issued, authorizing them to impress\r\nsinging-boys for the King's Chapel.[6] Afterwards, by the good offices\r\nof some friend, he was admitted into the choir of St. Paul's Cathedral,\r\nwhere he acquired a considerable proficiency in music under the tuition\r\nof John Redford, the organist and almoner, of whom he speaks in terms\r\nof the highest praise. From St. Paul's he was sent to Eton, probably\r\nin 1540 or 1541, \"to learn the Latin phrase,\" and was for some time\r\na pupil of Nicholas Udall,[7] the author of \"Roister Doister,\" who\r\nappears to have been a second Orbilius, and by whom he was unmercifully\r\nthrashed, receiving on one occasion, \"for fault but small, or none at\r\nall,\" no fewer than fifty-three stripes.\r\n\r\nFrom Eton he passed on to Cambridge, and, as already stated, was\r\nelected to King's College in 1543,[8] but afterwards removed to\r\nTrinity Hall, of which he appears to have retained pleasant memories.\r\nBeing obliged by a long illness to discontinue his studies, he left\r\nthe University, and joined the Court as a retainer of William, Lord\r\nPaget,[9] by whom he was probably employed as a musician, and of whom\r\nhe speaks in terms of praise and affection. In this manner the next ten\r\nyears were passed, and during this time his parents died. At the end of\r\nthis period, either from disgust at the vices of the Court, or finding,\r\nto use his own words, \"the Court began to frown,\" he retired into the\r\ncountry, married,[10] and settled down as a farmer at Cattiwade,[11]\r\na hamlet in the parish of Brantham, in Suffolk, and on the borders of\r\nEssex, where he composed his \"Hundredth Good Pointes of Husbandrie,\"\r\nthe first edition of which appeared in 1557.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of his wife's ill-health, he removed to Ipswich, \"a\r\ntown of price, like Paradise.\" Here his wife died, and he married Amy,\r\ndaughter of Edmond Moon, and settled down at West Dereham in Norfolk.\r\nOn leaving this town, on account of the litigious character of his\r\nneighbours, he became, probably through the influence of his patron,\r\nSir Robert Southwell,[12] a lay-clerk or singing-man in the Cathedral\r\nat Norwich, the Dean of which, John Salisbury, appears to have\r\nbefriended him in every way.\r\n\r\nFrom Norwich a painful illness caused him to remove to Fairsted, about\r\nfour miles from Witham, in Essex, the tithes of which parish he farmed;\r\nbecoming involved in \"tithing strife,\" he left that village, and once\r\nmore returned to London, where we find him living in St. Giles's,\r\nCripplegate, in 1572.[13] The plague, however, breaking out,[14] he\r\nreturned to Cambridge, where he at last found \"a resting plot\" in his\r\nfavourite College, Trinity Hall, in the choir of which he appears to\r\nhave been employed, as he was matriculated as a servant of the College,\r\nprobably on May 5th, 1573.[15]\r\n\r\nHis death, as appears from a paper read before the London and Middlesex\r\nArchæological Society, took place in London, on the 3rd May, 1580, in\r\nthe fifty-fifth or fifty-sixth year of his age. His will,[16] which is\r\ndated 25th April of that year, was proved by his son on the 8th August\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in the Church of St. Mildred, in the Poultry, where was\r\nformerly, according to Stow,[17] a monument to his memory, inscribed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Here Thomas Tusser, clad in earth doth lie,\r\nThat sometime made the Poyntes of Husbandrie;\r\nBy him then learne thou maist, here learne we must,\r\nWhen all is done we sleepe and turne to dust,\r\nAnd yet through Christ to heaven we hope to go,\r\nWho reades his bookes, shall find his faith was so.\"\r\n\r\nThis inscription is perfectly in character with the man, and was\r\nprobably written by Tusser himself.\r\n\r\nA mural tablet to his memory has been erected in Manningtree Church in\r\nEssex, with the following inscription: \"Sacred to the memory of Thomas\r\nTusser, Gent., born at Rivenhall, in Essex, and occupier of Braham\r\nHall[18] near this town, in the reign of King Edward the Sixth, where\r\nhe wrote his celebrated poetical treatise, entitled, _Five Hundred\r\nPoints of Good Husbandry, etc._ His writings show that he possessed a\r\ntruly Christian spirit, and his excellent maxims and observations on\r\nrural affairs evince that he was far in advance of the age in which he\r\nlived. He died in London in 1580, at the age of 65, and was interred in\r\nthe parish church of St. Mildred in the Poultry, where the following\r\nepitaph, said to have been written by himself, recorded his memory;\"\r\nthen follows a copy of the epitaph already given.\r\n\r\nThe statement in this inscription that he wrote the \"Five Hundred\r\nPoints\" at Braham Hall is incorrect; what he did write there was the\r\n\"One Hundred Points of Good Husbandrie,\" afterwards enlarged to \"Five\r\nHundred Points.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been a very generally received opinion that Tusser died in great\r\npoverty. Fuller, in his \"Worthies of Essex,\" p. 334, says, \"Whether\r\nhe bought or sold, he lost, and when a renter impoverished himself,\r\nand never enriched his landlord; he spread his bread with all sorts of\r\nbutter; yet none could stick thereon.\" Warton also says:[19] \"Without\r\na tincture of careless imprudence, or vicious extravagance, this\r\ndesultory character seems to have thrived in no vocation.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in Peacham's \"Minerva,\" a book of emblems printed in 1612, there\r\nis a device of a whetstone and a scythe, with these lines:--\r\n\r\n\"They tell me, Tusser, when thou wert alive,\r\nAnd hadst for profit turned every stone,\r\nWhere'er thou camest, thou could'st never thrive,\r\nThough hereto best thou could'st counsel every one,\r\n  As it may in thy Husbandry appear;\r\nWherein afresh thou liv'st among us here.\r\nSo like thy self, a number more are wont,\r\n  To sharpen others with advice of wit,\r\nWhen they themselves are like the whetstone blunt.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThese statements, however, appear to be scarcely borne out by Tusser's\r\nwill. By it we find that, at the time of his death, his brother William\r\nowed him £330, a large sum in those days, and, further, that he was\r\nthe owner of two small copyhold and leasehold farms. Had he been so\r\nunfortunate in all his undertakings, and been, as Fuller terms him, \"a\r\nstone which gathers no moss,\" Tusser would hardly have been able to\r\nlend his brother such a sum of money. If, however, it be true that he\r\nlived and died poor, we may, in all probability, attribute it to his\r\nlove of hospitality, a prominent feature in his character, as well as\r\nto a roving and unsteady disposition.\r\n\r\nDr. Mavor states in the introduction to his edition of 1810, p. 11,\r\nthat \"it may be inferred from his [Tusser's] own words, that his\r\nhappiness was not permanently promoted by this match [his second\r\nmarriage]. He seems to complain of the charges incident 'to a wife in\r\nyouth,' and had she transmitted her thoughts to posterity, we should\r\nprobably have heard some insinuations against an old husband.\" I fail,\r\nhowever, to see sufficient grounds for this assertion: on the contrary,\r\nTusser's words on the only occasion on which he speaks of his second\r\nwife seem to bear an opposite construction:--\r\n\r\n\"I chanced soon to find a Moon\r\n      of cheerful hue;\r\nWhich well a fine me thought did shine\r\nAnd never change--(a thing most strange)\r\nYet kept in sight her course aright,\r\n      And compass true.\"----Chapt. 114, stanza 19.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in several passages he speaks of the increased\r\nexpenses and responsibilities incident to a married life, but only,\r\nas it appears to me, with the view of deterring others from entering\r\ninto that state without carefully considering beforehand the cost and\r\nprobable consequences of such a step.\r\n\r\nBy his first wife Tusser had no children, but by the second, who\r\nsurvived him, he had three sons, Thomas, John and Edmond, and one\r\ndaughter Mary.\r\n\r\nHis will, which is exceedingly characteristic, is given in full at\r\nthe end of this introduction, from a copy in the British Museum,[21]\r\nprivately printed in 1846 by Mr. Charles Clark, of Great Totham, Essex,\r\nfrom a transcript furnished to him by Mr. E. Ventris, of Cambridge, by\r\nwhom the original was discovered in the Registry at Ely.[22] At the\r\nend of the will were printed Tusser's metrical Autobiography, and a\r\nfew notices from nearly contemporary authors. Mr. Clark also printed\r\nin 1834 a few copies of the original edition of 1557 of the \"Hundredth\r\ngood Poyntes of Husbandrie.\"\r\n\r\nTusser was, as may be seen from his writings, a man of high religious\r\nprinciples, good-natured and cheerful, of a kindly and generous\r\ndisposition, and hospitable to a fault. Although he constantly\r\ninculcates economy, he was entirely free from the meanness and pitiful\r\nspirit, which, according to Stillingfleet, made farmers of his time\r\nstarve their cattle, their land and everything belonging to them;\r\nchoosing rather to lose a pound than spend a shilling. \"Mirth and good\r\ncheer,\" seems to have been his motto, and although he may have been\r\nimprudent in allowing his love of hospitality to be carried to such\r\nan excess as to keep him from independence, yet we cannot help loving\r\nthe man, and admiring the justness of his sentiments on every subject\r\nconnected with life and morals. Strict as he appears to have been\r\nin all matters connected with religion, he was far from being what\r\nhe terms \"fantastically scrupulous,\" or, as we should now say, of a\r\npuritanical disposition. He prefers a merry fellow to a grave designing\r\nvillain:--\r\n\r\n\"Play thou the good fellow! seeke none to misdeeme;\r\nDisdaine not the honest, though merie they seeme;\r\nFor oftentimes seene, no more verie a knave,\r\nThan he that doth counterfeit most to be grave.\"[23]\r\n\r\nHow strongly, too, does he support the keeping up of the old\r\n\"feasting-daies,\" \"Olde customes that good be let no man dispise,\" the\r\nfestivities of Christmas,[24] the Harvest Home, etc. His maxims on the\r\ntreatment of servants and dependents are conceived in a truly Christian\r\nspirit, as when he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Once ended thy harvest, let none be beguil'd,\r\nPlease such as did help thee--man, woman, and child;\r\nThus doing with alway such help as they can,\r\nThou winnest the praise of the labouring man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good servants hope justly some friendship to feel,\r\nAnd look to have favour, what time they do well.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, such as these--\r\n\r\n\"Be lowly, not sullen, if aught go amiss,\r\nWhat wresting may lose thee, that win with a kiss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember the poor that for God's sake do call,\r\nFor God both rewardeth and blesseth withall.\r\nTake this in good part, whatsoever thou be,\r\nAnd wish me no worse than I wish unto thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe versification of Tusser does not call for any lengthened remarks.\r\nThe greater portion of his work is written in the same anapæstic metre,\r\nwhich, though rough, is well adapted for retention in the memory. There\r\nare, however, two exceptions worthy of special notice: firstly, the\r\n\"Preface to the Buier\" (ch. 5) and the \"Comparison between Champion\r\nCountrie and Severall\" (ch. 63), which are the first examples of a\r\nmetre afterwards adopted by Prior and Shenstone, and generally believed\r\nto have originated with the latter: secondly, the \"Author's linked\r\nverses\" (ch. 113), a species of what Dr. Guest calls Inverse Rhime\r\nin the following passage from his \"History of English Rhythms\":[25]\r\n\"Inverse Rhime is that which exists between the last accented syllable\r\nof the first section, and the first accented syllable of the second.\r\nIt appears to have flourished most in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies. I do not remember any instance of it in Anglo-Saxon, but it\r\nis probably of native growth.[26] A kindred dialect, the Icelandic,\r\nhad, at an early period, a species of rhime closely resembling the\r\npresent--the second verse always beginning with the last accented\r\nsyllable of the first. It is singular that the French had in the\r\nsixteenth century a rhime like the Icelandic, called by them _la rime\r\nentrelassée_. The present rhime differed from it, as it was contained\r\nin one verse.... Thus:--\r\n\r\n\"'These steps| both _reach_|| and _teach_| thou shalt|\r\nTo come| by _thrift_|| to _shift_| withal|.'----Tusser.\r\n\r\n\"'The pi|pers _loud_|| and _loud_|er blew|,\r\nThe dan|cers _quick_|| and _quick_|er flew|.'----Burns.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are Tusser's principal peculiarities:--\r\n\r\n1. The use of a plural noun with a verb singular. This very frequently\r\noccurs. \"_Some_,\" too, is almost invariably treated thus.\r\n\r\n2. His omissions and elliptical phrases, such as [while]\r\n_plough-cattle_ [are] _a-baiting_ (85/2); _thy market_ [having been]\r\n_despatched_, 57/45; _a small_ [income] 62/11; in the mottoes of\r\nthe months, [work] _forgotten_ [in the] _month past_; and in such\r\nexpressions as \"_fault known_\" 47/22, \"_that done_\" 55/2, \"_who\r\nliving_\" 26/1, etc.\r\n\r\n3. Peculiarities of rime. Tusser appears to have attributed far more\r\nimportance to the _outward appearance_ of his riming words, than to\r\nthe _reality_ of the rimes. So long as they _appeared_ to rime, it\r\nseems to have mattered little that in _pronunciation_ they were widely\r\ndifferent. We thus find them constantly (_a_) changing the spelling of\r\nwords in order to make them _look like_ others; and again (_b_) using\r\nas rimes words which, though similarly spelt, are totally unlike in\r\npronunciation. The following examples will suffice. In alterations of\r\northography we find _weight_ (for wait) to rime with _eight; raies_\r\n(for raise); _mutch_ to rime with _hutch; thease_ to rime with _ease;\r\nise_ (for ice) to rime with _device; flo_ (for flow) to rime with _fro;\r\nfeere_ (for fire or fier) to rime with _Janiveere; tought_ (for taught)\r\nto rime with _thought; cace_ (for case) to rime with _place; waight_\r\n(for wait) to rime with _straight; bilde_, to rime with _childe; thoes_\r\n(for those) to rime with _sloes_, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we find such rimes as the following: _plough, rough;\r\nshew, few; have, save; have, crave; feat, great; overthwart, part;\r\nshal, fal;_ and a very curious instance in Chapter 69, stanza 1, where\r\n_thrive_ is made to rime with _atchive_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the number of editions through which an author's works pass be a\r\nproof of merit, as it certainly is of popularity, few writers of his\r\ntime can enter into competition with Tusser. During the forty years\r\nfrom the appearance of the first edition of the \"One Hundreth Poyntes\"\r\nin 1557 to the end of the sixteenth century, no fewer than _thirteen_\r\neditions of his work are known to have been published. Yet all are\r\nscarce, and few of those surviving are perfect; a proof that what was\r\nintended for practical use had been sedulously applied to that purpose.\r\n\"Some books,\" says Mr. Haslewood, in the \"British Bibliographer,\" No.\r\niii., \"become heir-looms from value; and Tusser's work, for useful\r\ninformation in every department of agriculture, together with its\r\nquaint and amusing observations, perhaps passed the copies from father\r\nto son, till they crumbled away in the bare shifting of the pages,\r\nand the mouldering relic only lost its value by the casual mutilation\r\nof time.\" Subjoined is a list of all the various recorded editions,\r\nextracted from Mavor's introduction and other sources.\r\n\r\n 1557. A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie. Reprinted here from the\r\n unique copy in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n 1561. Thomas Hacher had licence for a \"dyalogue of wyuynge and\r\n thryuynge of Tusshers, with ij lessons for olde and yonge.\" Ritson,\r\n though improperly, considers this as a different work from the piece\r\n which appears under the same title in later editions.[27]\r\n\r\n 1562. It appears probable that this edition, though its existence\r\n is disputed by some, contained the original germ of the Book of\r\n Huswifery, as we find, on the authority of Warton, that in the\r\n preceding year Richard Totell had licence to print \"a booke entituled\r\n one hundreth good poyntes of housbondry lately maryed unto a hundreth\r\n poyntes of huswiffry, newly corrected and amplyfyed.\"[28]\r\n\r\n 1564. The existence of an edition of this date rests on the authority\r\n of Otridge's Catalogue, 1794. It is probably a misprint for 1562.\r\n\r\n 1570. A hundreth good pointes of husbandry, lately maried unto a\r\n hundreth good poynts of huswifery: newly corrected and amplified, with\r\n dyuers proper lessons for householders, as by the table at the latter\r\n ende more plainly may appeare.

Edward VI.): \"The\r\nchildren of the Chappelle were 8 in number, with a Master of Songe to\r\nteach them. And when any of the children comene to be xviij yeares of\r\nage, and their voices change, ne cannot be preferred in this Chappelle,\r\nthe nombere being full, then, yf they will assente, the kyng assynethe\r\nthem to a College of Oxford or Cambridge of his fundatione, there to be\r\nat fynding and studye both suffycyently, tylle the king may otherwise\r\nadvanse them.\"--Query, was Tusser assigned in this way to King's\r\nCollege, Cambridge?\r\n\r\n[7] Nicholas Udall took his degree of M.A. at Oxford in 1534.\r\n\r\n[8] Hatcher, MSS.

Cant.\r\n\r\n[9] Of this nobleman, the ancestor of the Earl of Uxbridge, a very\r\nfull account is given in Dugdale, from which it appears that he was\r\nborn at Wednesbury in Staffordshire, his father being one of the\r\nSerjeants-at-Mace of the city of London. Under Henry VIII. he was\r\nAmbassador to France, and Master of the Post. In 1549 he obtained\r\na grant of the fee of the house without Temple Bar, first called\r\nPaget House, then Leicester House, and lastly Essex House. Two years\r\nafterwards he was Ambassador to the Emperor Charles V., and in the\r\nsame year was called by writ to Parliament by the title of Lord Paget\r\nof Beaudesert, _Com. Salop._, and soon after sent to treat for peace\r\nwith France. On the fall of the Duke of Somerset, he was charged\r\nwith designing the murder of several noblemen at Paget House, and in\r\nconsequence was sent to the Tower, deprived of his honours and offices,\r\nand fined £6000, one-third of which was remitted. On the death of\r\nEdward VI. he joined the Earl of Arundel, the chief champion of Queen\r\nMary, and gained her favour by his activity. Soon after her marriage\r\nwith Philip, he was sent Ambassador to the Emperor at Brussels, to\r\nconsult Cardinal Pole respecting the restoration of Popery. In this\r\nreign he was made Lord Privy Seal. Lord Paget died very aged, in 1563,\r\nand was buried at Drayton in Middlesex. He left issue by Anne, daughter\r\nof ---- Prestin, Esq., _Com. Lanc._, three sons and five daughters. His\r\neldest son Henry succeeded him in the title; but dying in 1568, the\r\npeerage descended to his next brother, Thomas, whom Tusser claims also\r\nfor a patron. Thomas being zealously affected to Popery, and implicated\r\nin the plots in favour of Mary Queen of Scots, fled and was attainted\r\n1587, and died three years after at Brussels, leaving one son, Thomas,\r\nwho succeeded him.\r\n\r\n[10] Of the name and family of his first wife we are entirely ignorant.\r\n\r\n[11] In later editions printed Ratwade, and transferred to Sussex, a\r\nmistake into which Warton has fallen.\r\n\r\n[12] Tusser is generally supposed to have addressed Sir _Richard_\r\nSouthwell as \"Thou worthy wight, thou famous knight,\" but it is clear\r\nthat Sir _Robert_ Southwell is intended, for in 1573 Tusser alludes to\r\nSouthwell's death as having occurred some years before, but Sir Richard\r\nSouthwell did not die till 1579, while Sir Robert died twenty years\r\npreviously.--Cooper, Ath. Cant.\r\n\r\n[13] His second son, Edmond, was baptized at St. Giles's, Cripplegate,\r\n13th March, 1572-3.\r\n\r\n[14] The plague to which Tusser evidently alludes (in stanza 31 of\r\nAutobiography), according to Maitland, raged in London in 1573 and 1574.\r\n\r\n[15] Cooper, Ath.

winnes love of thy neighbour, and credit doth breede,\r\nSo neuer to craue, but to liue of thine owne,\r\n  brings comforts a thousand, to many vnknowne.\r\n\r\n32\r\nWho liuing but lends? and be lent to they must;\r\n  else buieng and selling might lie in the dust;\r\nBut shameles and craftie, that desperate are,\r\n  make many ful honest the woorser to fare.[E47]\r\n\r\n33\r\nAt some time to

end.\r\n\r\n35[11]\r\nSome spareth too late, and a number with him,\r\n  the foole at the bottom, the wise at the brim:[E48]\r\nWho careth nor spareth, till spent he hath all,\r\n  Of bobbing, not robbing, be fearefull he shall.\r\n\r\n36\r\nWhere welthines floweth, no friendship can lack,\r\n  whom pouertie pincheth, hath friendship as slack:\r\nThen happie is he by example that can\r\n  take heede by the fall of a mischieued man.[E49]\r\n\r\n37\r\nWho breaketh his credit, or cracketh it twise,\r\n  trust such with a suretie, if ye be wise:\r\nOr if he be angrie, for asking thy due,\r\n

and docking the dell:\r\n  and by and by after, of beggerie smell.[13]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thrifts Auditor.]\r\n\r\n41\r\nOnce weekelie remember thy charges to cast,\r\n  once monthlie see how thy expences may last:\r\nIf quarter declareth too much to be spent,\r\n  for feare of ill yeere take aduise of thy rent.\r\n\r\n42\r\nWho orderlie entreth his paiment in booke,\r\n  may orderlie find them againe (if he looke.)\r\nAnd he that intendeth but once for to paie:\r\n  shall find this in dooing the quietest waie.\r\n\r\n43\r\nIn dealing vprightlie this counsel I teach,\r\n  first recken, then write, er[14] to purse yee doe reach,\r\nThen paie and dispatch him, as soone as ye can:\r\n  for lingring is hinderance to many a man.\r\n\r\n44\r\nHaue waights, I aduise thee, for siluer & gold,\r\n  for some be in knauerie now a daies bold:\r\nAnd for to be sure good monie to pay:\r\n  receiue that is currant, as neere as ye may.\r\n\r\n45\r\nDelight not for pleasure two houses to keepe,\r\n  least charge without measure vpon thee doe creepe.\r\nAnd Jankin and Jenikin[E51] coosen thee so\r\n  to make thee repent it, er yeere about go.\r\n\r\n46\r\nThe stone that is rouling can gather[15] no mosse,[E52]\r\n  who often remooueth is sure of losse.\r\nThe rich it compelleth to paie for his pride;\r\n  the poore it vndooeth on euerie side.\r\n\r\n47\r\nThe eie of the maister enricheth the hutch,\r\n  the eie of the mistresse auaileth as mutch.\r\nWhich eie, if it gouerne, with reason and skil,\r\n  hath seruant and seruice, at pleasure and wil.\r\n\r\n48\r\nWho seeketh reuengement of euerie wrong,\r\n  in quiet nor safetie continueth long.\r\nSo he that of wilfulnes trieth the law,\r\n  shall striue for a coxcome, and thriue as a daw.[E53]\r\n\r\n49\r\nTo hunters and haukers, take heede what ye saie,\r\n  milde answere with curtesie driues them awaie:\r\nSo, where a mans better wil open a gap,\r\n  resist not with rudenes, for feare of mishap.[E54]\r\n\r\n50\r\nA man in this world for a churle that is knowne,\r\n  shall hardlie in quiet keepe that is his owne:\r\nWhere lowlie and such as of curtesie smels,\r\n  finds fauor and friendship where euer he dwels.\r\n\r\n51\r\nKeepe truelie thy Saboth, the better to speed,\r\n  Keepe seruant from gadding, but when it is need.\r\nKeepe fishdaie and fasting daie, as they doe fal:[E55]\r\n  what custome thou keepest, let others keepe al.\r\n\r\n52[16]\r\nThough some in their tithing be slack or too bold,\r\n  be thou vnto Godward not that waie too cold:\r\nEuill conscience grudgeth, and yet we doe see\r\n  ill tithers ill thriuers most commonlie bee.\r\n\r\n53\r\nPaie weekelie thy workman, his houshold to feed,\r\n  paie quarterlie seruants, to buie as they need:\r\nGiue garment to such as deserue and no mo,\r\n  least thou and thy wife without garment doe go.\r\n\r\n54\r\nBeware raskabilia, slothfull to wurke,\r\n  purloiners and filchers, that loueth to lurke.\r\nAway with such lubbers, so loth to take paine,\r\n  that roules in expences, but neuer no gaine.\r\n\r\n55\r\nGood wife, and good children, are worthie to eate,\r\n  good seruant, good laborer, earneth their meate:\r\nGood friend, and good neighbor, that fellowlie gest,\r\n  with hartilie welcome, should haue of the best.\r\n\r\n56\r\nDepart not with al that thou hast to thy childe,\r\n  much lesse vnto other, for being beguilde:\r\nLeast, if thou wouldst gladlie possesse it agen,\r\n  looke for to come by it thou wottest not when.\r\n\r\n57\r\nThe greatest preferment that childe we can giue,\r\n  is learning and nurture, to traine him to liue:\r\nWhich who so it wanteth, though left as a squier,\r\n  consumeth to nothing, as block in the fier.\r\n\r\n58\r\nWhen God hath so blest thee, as able to liue,\r\n  and thou hast to rest thee, and able to giue,\r\nLament thy offences, serue God for amends,\r\n  make soule to be readie when God for it sends.\r\n\r\n59\r\nSend fruites of thy faith to heauen aforehand,\r\n  for mercie here dooing, God blesseth thy land:\r\nHe maketh thy store with his blessing to swim,\r\n  and after, thy soule to be blessed with him.\r\n\r\n60\r\nSome lay to get riches by sea and by land,\r\n  and ventreth his life in his enimies hand:\r\nAnd setteth his soule vpon sixe or on seauen,[E56]\r\n  not fearing nor caring for hell nor for heauen.\r\n\r\n61\r\nSome pincheth, and spareth, and pineth his life,\r\n  to cofer vp bags for to leaue to his wife:\r\nAnd she (when he dieth) sets open the chest,\r\n  for such as can sooth hir and all away wrest.\r\n\r\n62\r\nGood husband, preuenting the frailnes of some,\r\n  takes part of Gods benefits, as they doo come,\r\nAnd leaueth to wife and his children the rest,\r\n  each one his owne part, as he thinketh it best.\r\n\r\n63\r\nThese lessons approoued, if wiselie ye note,\r\n  may saue and auantage ye many a grote.\r\nWhich if ye can follow, occasion

gotten with toile.\r\n\r\n9\r\nIn Brantham,[E107] where rie but no barlie did growe,\r\n  good barlie I had, as a meany did knowe:\r\nFive seame of an aker I truely was paid,\r\n  for thirtie lode muck of each aker so laid.\r\n\r\n10\r\nIn Suffolke againe, where as wheat neuer grew,\r\n  good husbandrie vsed good wheat land I knew:\r\nThis Prouerbe experience long ago gaue,\r\n that nothing who practiseth nothing shall haue.\r\n\r\n11\r\nAs grauell and sand is for rie and not wheat,\r\n  (or yeeldeth hir burden to tone the more great,)\r\nSo peason and barlie delight not in sand,\r\n  but rather in claie or in rottener land.\r\n\r\n12\r\nWheat somtime is steelie or burnt as it growes,\r\n  for pride[7] or for pouertie practise so knowes.\r\nToo lustie of courage for wheat doth not

prooue lustie and long,\r\n  it signifieth land to be hartie and strong.\r\n\r\n14\r\nAs land full of tilth and in hartie good plight,\r\n  yeelds blade to a length and encreaseth in might,\r\nSo crop vpon crop, vpon whose courage we doubt,\r\n  yeelds blade for a brag, but it holdeth not out.\r\n\r\n15\r\nThe straw and the eare to haue bignes and length,\r\n  betokeneth land to be good and in strength.\r\nIf eare be but short, and the strawe be but small,\r\n  it signifieth barenes and barren withall.\r\n\r\n16\r\nWhite wheat or else red, red riuet or whight,\r\n  far passeth all other, for land that is light.\r\nWhite pollard or red, that so richly is set,\r\n  for land that is heauie is best ye can get.\r\n\r\n17\r\nMaine wheat that is mixed with white and with red\r\n  is next to the best in the market mans hed:\r\nSo Turkey or Purkey wheat[E109] many doe loue,\r\n  because it is flourie, as others aboue.\r\n\r\n18\r\nGraie wheat is the grosest, yet good for the clay,\r\n  though woorst for the market, as fermer may say.\r\nMuch like vnto rie be his properties found,\r\n  coorse flower, much bran, and a peeler of ground.\r\n\r\n19\r\nOtes, rie, or else barlie, and wheat that is gray,\r\n  brings land out of comfort, and soone to decay:\r\nOne after another, no comfort betweene,\r\n  is crop vpon crop, as will quickly be seene.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crop vpon crop.]\r\n\r\n20\r\nStill crop vpon crop many farmers do take,\r\n  and reape little profit for greedines sake.\r\nThough breadcorne & drinkcorn[E110] such croppers do stand:\r\n  count peason or brank, as a comfort to land.\r\n\r\n21\r\nGood land that is seuerall, crops may haue three,\r\n  in champion countrie it may not so bee:\r\nTon taketh his season, as commoners may,\r\n  the tother with reason may otherwise say.\r\n\r\n22\r\nSome vseth at first a good fallow to make,\r\n  to sowe thereon barlie, the better to take.\r\nNext that to sowe pease, and of that to sowe wheat,\r\n  then fallow againe, or lie lay for thy neat.\r\n\r\n23\r\nFirst rie, and then barlie, the champion saies,\r\n  or wheat before barlie be champion waies:\r\nBut drinke before bread corne with Middlesex men,\r\n  then lay on more compas, and fallow agen.\r\n\r\n24\r\nWhere barlie ye sowe, after rie or else wheat,\r\n  if land be vnlustie,[8] the crop is not great,\r\nSo lose ye your cost, to your coresie and smart,\r\n  and land (ouerburdened) is cleane out of hart.\r\n\r\n25\r\nExceptions take of the champion land,\r\n  from lieng alonge from that at thy hand.\r\n(Just by) ye may comfort with compas at will,\r\n  far off ye must comfort with fauor and skill.\r\n\r\n26\r\nWhere rie or else wheat either barlie ye sowe,\r\n  let codware be next, therevpon for to growe:\r\nThus hauing two crops, whereof codware is ton,\r\n  thou hast the lesse neede, to lay cost therevpon.\r\n\r\n27\r\nSome far fro the market delight not in pease,\r\n  for that ery chapman they seeme not to please.\r\nIf vent of the market place serue thee not well,\r\n  set hogs vp a fatting, to drouer to sell.\r\n\r\n28\r\nTwo crops of a fallow enricheth the plough,\r\n  though tone be of pease, it is land good ynough:\r\nOne crop and a fallow some soile will abide,\r\n  where if ye go furder lay profit aside.\r\n\r\n29\r\nWhere peason ye had and a fallow thereon,\r\n  sowe wheat ye may well without doong therevpon:\r\nNew broken vpland, or with water opprest,\r\n  or ouer much doonged, for wheat is not best.\r\n\r\n30\r\nWhere water all winter annoieth too much,\r\n  bestowe not thy wheat vpon land that is such:\r\nBut rather sowe otes, or else bullimong[E111] there,\r\n  gray peason, or runciuals, fitches, or tere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sowing of acorns.]\r\n\r\n31\r\nSowe acornes

more lusty the layer, more plenty they come.\r\n\r\n33\r\nGo plow vp or delue vp, aduised with skill,\r\n  the bredth of a ridge, and in length as you will.\r\nWhere speedy quickset for a fence ye wil drawe,\r\n  to sowe in the seede of the bremble and hawe.[E112]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A disease in fat hogs.]\r\n\r\n34\r\nThrough plenty of acornes, the porkling to fat,\r\n  not taken in season, may

_Obiection._\r\n[22]\r\nWhy then I see to take a shrew,\r\n(As seldome other there be few)\r\n  Is not the way to thriue:\r\nSo hard a thing I spie it is,\r\nThe good to chuse, the shrew to mis,\r\n

thow.\r\n\r\n5\r\nWhere husband and huswife be both out of place,\r\n  there seruants doo loiter, and reason their cace.[E430]\r\n\r\n6\r\nThe huswife so named (of keeping the house,)\r\n  must tend on hir profit, as cat on the mouse.\r\n\r\n    Seeke home for rest,\r\n    For home is best.\r\n\r\n7\r\nAs huswiues keepe home, and be stirrers about,\r\n  so speedeth their winnings, the yeere thorow out.\r\n\r\n8\r\nThough home be but homely, yet huswife is taught,\r\n  that home hath no fellow to such as haue aught.[E431]\r\n\r\n  ¶ Vse all with skill,\r\n    Aske what ye will.\r\n\r\n9\r\nGood vsage with knowledge, and quiet withall,\r\n  make huswife to shine, as the sunne on the wall.\r\n\r\n10\r\nWhat husband refuseth all comely to haue,\r\n  that hath a good

kepe best:\r\nthen yoke well the great knaues, and fauour the rest.\r\n\r\n29.\r\nBut yoke not thy swine, while thine akorne time last:\r\nfor diuers misfortunes, that happen to fast.\r\nOr if thou loue eared, and vnmaimed hogges:\r\ngiue eie to thy neighbour, and eare to his dogges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ November.\r\n\r\n\r\n30.\r\nGet vp with thy barley lande, dry as thou can:\r\nat March (as

threshers were wood.\r\nBeware they threshe clene, though the lesser they yarne:\r\nand if thou wilt thriue, loke thy selfe to thy barne.\r\n\r\n37.\r\nIf barne rome will serue, lay thy stoouer vp drye\r\nand eche kinde of strawe, by hitselfe let it lie.\r\nThy chaffe, housed sweete, kept from pullein and dust:\r\nshall serue well thy horses, when labour they must.\r\n\r\n38.\r\nWhen pasture is gone, and the fildes mier and weate:\r\nthen stable thy plough horse, and there giue them meate.\r\nThe better thou vse them, in place where they stande:\r\nmore strength shall they haue, for to

doore.\r\n\r\n44.\r\nGood fruite and good plenty, doth well in thy loft:\r\nthen lay for an orcharde, and cherishe it oft.\r\nThe profet is mickell, the pleasure is mutch;\r\nat pleasure with profet, few wise men will grutch.\r\n\r\n45.\r\nFor plantes and for stockes, lay afore hand to cast:\r\nbut set or remoue them, while twelue tide doe last.\r\nSet one from another, full twenty fote square:\r\nthe better and greater, they yerely will bare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ January.\r\n\r\n\r\n46.\r\nWhen Christmas is done, kepe not Christmas time still:\r\nbe mindefull of rering, and loth for to kill.\r\nFor then, what thou rerist thou nede not to dout:\r\nwill double thy gaine, ere the yere come about.\r\n\r\n47.\r\nBe gredy to spende all, and careles to saue:\r\nand shortly be nedy, and redy to craue.\r\nbe wilfull to kill, and vnskilfull to store:\r\nand sone giue vp houskeping, longe any more.\r\n\r\n48.\r\nThy calues then, that come betwene new yere and lent:\r\nsaue gladly for

three.\r\n\r\n51.\r\nGeld vnder the dame, within fornight at least:\r\nand saue both thy money, and life of the beast.\r\nBut gelde with the gelder, as many one doe:\r\nand of halfe a dosen, go geld away two.\r\n\r\n52.\r\nThy coltes for the sadle, geld yong to be light:\r\nfor cart doe not so, if thou iudgest a right.\r\nNor geld not, but when they be lusty and fat:\r\nfor there is a point, to be learned in that.\r\n\r\n53.\r\nGeld marefoles, but titts ere and nine dayes of age:\r\nthey die els of gelding, some gelders wil gage.\r\nBut marefoles, both likely of bulke and of bone:\r\nkepe such to bring coltes, let their gelding alone.\r\n\r\n54.\r\nFor gaining a trifle, sell neuer thy store:\r\nfor chaunsing on worse, then thine owne were before.\r\nMore larger of body, the better for brede:\r\nmore forward of growing, the better they spede.\r\n\r\n55.\r\nThy sowes, great with fare, that come best for to rere:\r\nloke dayly thou seest them, and count them full dere.\r\nFor that time, the losse of one fare of thy sowe:\r\nis greater, then losse of two calues of thy kowe.\r\n\r\n56.\r\nA kow good of milk, big of bulke, hayle and sounde,\r\nis yerely for profet, as good as a pounde.\r\nAnd yet, by the yere haue I proued ere now:\r\nas good to the purse, is a sow as a kow.\r\n\r\n57.\r\nKepe one and kepe both, so thou maist if thou wilt:\r\nthen all shall be saued, and nothing be spilt.\r\nKepe two bease, and one sow, and liue at thine ease:\r\nand no time for nede, bye thy meate but thou please.\r\n\r\n58.\r\nWho both by his calues, and his lambes will be knowne:\r\nmay well kill a neate, and a shepe of his owne.\r\nAnd he, that will rere vp a pig in his house:\r\nshall eate sweter bakon, and cheaper fed sowse.\r\n\r\n59.\r\nBut eate vp thy veale, pig and lambe being froth:\r\nand twise in a weeke, go to bed without broth.\r\nAs that man that pas not, but sell away sell:\r\nshall neuer kepe good house, where euer he dwell.\r\n\r\n60.\r\nSpende none but thyne owne, howsoeuer thou spende:\r\nnor haft not to god ward, for that he doth sende.\r\nTythe truly for al thing, let pas of the rest:\r\nthe iust man, his dealinges god prospereth best.\r\n\r\n61.\r\nIn January, husbandes that powcheth the grotes:\r\nwill breake vp their lay, or be sowing of otes.\r\nSow Jauiuer Otes, and lay them by thy wheate;\r\nin May, bye thy hay for thy

betimes they will come:\r\nthe sooner, the better they fill vp a rome.\r\n\r\n63.\r\nIn euery grene, where the fence is not thine:\r\nthe thornes stub out cleane, that the grasse may be fine.\r\nThy neighbours wil borow, els hack them beliue:\r\nso neither thy grasse, nor the bushes shall thriue.\r\n\r\n64.\r\nThy seruant, in walking thy pastures aboute:\r\nfor yokes, forkes and rakes, let him loke to finde oute.\r\nAnd after at leyser let this be his hier:\r\nto trimme them and make them at home by the fier.\r\n\r\n65.\r\nWhen frostes will not suffer to ditche nor to hedge:\r\nthen get the an heate, with thy betill and wedge.\r\nA blocke at the harthe, cowched close for thy life:\r\nshall helpe to saue fier bote, and please well thy wife.\r\n\r\n66.\r\nThen lop for thy fewel, the powlinges well growen:\r\nthat hindreth the corne, or the grasse to be mowen.\r\nIn lopping, and cropping, saue Edder and stake\r\nthyne hedges, where nede is to mende or to make.\r\n\r\n67.\r\nNo stick, nor no stone, leaue vnpicked vp clene:\r\nfor hurting thy sieth, or for harming thy grene.\r\nFor sauing of al thing, get home with the rest,\r\nthe snow frozen hardest, thy cart may goe best.\r\n\r\n68.\r\nSpare meddowes at shroftide, spare marshes at paske:\r\nfor feare of a drougth, neuer longer time aske.\r\nThen hedge them, and ditche them, bestow thereon pence:\r\nfor meddow and corne, craueth euer good fence.\r\n\r\n69.\r\nAnd alway, let this be a part of thy care:\r\nfor shift of good pasture, lay pasture to spare.\r\nThen seauer thy groundes, and so keping them still:\r\nfinde cattel at ease, and haue pasture at will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ Marche.\r\n\r\n\r\n70.\r\nIn Marche, sow thy barley thy londe not to colde:\r\nthe drier the better, a hundreth times tolde.\r\nThat tilth harrowde finely, set sede time an ende:\r\nand praise, and pray God a good haruest to sende.\r\n\r\n71.\r\nSow wheate in a meane, sow thy Rie not to thin;\r\nlet peason and beanes, here and there, take therein.\r\nSow barley and otes, good and thick doe not spare:\r\ngiue lande leaue, her sede or her wede for to bare.\r\n\r\n72.\r\nFor barley and pease, harrow after thou sowe:\r\nfor rye, harrow first seldome after I trowe.\r\nLet wheat haue a clodde, for to couer the hedde:\r\nthat after a frost, it may out and goe spredde.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ A digression from husbandrie:\r\nto a poynt or two of huswifrie.\r\n\r\n\r\n[72a]\r\nNow here I think nedeful, a pawse for to make;\r\nto treate of some paines, a good huswife must take.\r\nFor huswifes must husbande, as wel as the man:\r\nor farewel thy husbandrie, do what thou can.\r\n\r\n[72b]\r\nIn Marche, and in Aprill, from morning to night:\r\nin sowing and setting, good huswiues delight.\r\nTo haue in their gardein, or some other plot:\r\nto trim vp their house, and to furnish their pot.\r\n\r\n[72c]\r\nHaue millons at Mihelmas, parsneps in lent:\r\nin June, buttred beanes, saueth fish to be spent.\r\nWith those, and good pottage inough hauing than:\r\nthou winnest the heart, of thy laboring man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ Aprill.\r\n\r\n\r\n[72d]\r\nFrom Aprill begin, til saint Andrew be past:\r\nso long with good huswiues, their dairies doe last.\r\nGood milche bease and pasture, good husbandes prouide:\r\ngood huswiues know best, all the rest how to guide.\r\n\r\n[72e]\r\nBut huswiues, that learne not to make their owne cheese:\r\nwith trusting of others, haue this for their feese.\r\nTheir milke slapt in corners, their creame al to sost:\r\ntheir milk pannes so flotte, that their cheeses be lost.\r\n\r\n[72f]\r\nWhere some of a kowe, maketh yerely a pounde:\r\nthese huswiues crye creake, for their voice will not sounde.\r\nThe seruauntes, suspecting their dame lye in waighte:\r\nwith one thing or other, they trudge away straight.\r\n\r\n[72g]\r\nThen neighbour (for gods sake) if any such bee;\r\nif you know a good seruant, waine her to mee.\r\nSuch maister, suche man, and such mistres suche mayde\r\nsuch husbandes and huswiues, suche houses araide.\r\n\r\n[72h]\r\nFor flax and for hemp, for to haue of her owne:\r\nthe wife must in May, take good hede it be sowne.\r\nAnd trimme it, and kepe it to serue at a nede:\r\nthe femble to spin, and the karle for her sede.\r\n\r\n[72i]\r\nGood husbandes, abrode seketh al well to haue:\r\ngood huswiues, at home seketh al well to saue.\r\nThus hauing and sauing, in place where they meete:\r\nmake profit with pleasure, suche couples to greete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ May.\r\n\r\n\r\n73.\r\nBoth Philip and Jacob, bid put of thy lammes:\r\nthat thinkest to haue any milke of their dammes.\r\nBut Lammas aduiseth thee, milke not to long:\r\nfor hardnes make pouerty, skabbed among.\r\n\r\n74.\r\nTo milke and to folde them, is much to require:\r\nexcept thou haue pasture, to fill their desire.\r\nBut nightes being shorte, and such hede thou mayst take\r\nnot hurting their bodies, much profit to make.\r\n\r\n75.\r\nMilke six ewes, for one kowe, well chosen therefore:\r\nand double thy dayrie, els trust me no more.\r\nAnd yet may good huswiues, that knoweth the skill:\r\nhaue mixt or vnmixt, at their pleasure and will.\r\n\r\n76.\r\nFor gredy of gaine, ouerlay not thy grownde:\r\nand then shall thy cattell, be lusty and sownde.\r\nBut pinche them of pasture, while sommer time last:\r\nand plucke at their tailes, ere & winter be past.\r\n\r\n77.\r\nPinche weannels at no time, of water nor meate:\r\nif euer thou hope to have them good neate.\r\nIn sommer at al times, in winter in frost:\r\nif cattell lacke drinke, they be vtterly lost.\r\n\r\n78.\r\nIn May at the furdest, twy fallow thy lande:\r\nmuch drougth may cause after, thy plough els to stande.\r\nThat tilth being done, thou hast passed the wurste:\r\nthen after, who plowgheth, plowgh thou with the furste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ June.\r\n\r\n\r\n79.\r\nIn June get thy wedehoke, thy knife and thy gloue:\r\nand wede out such wede, as the corne doth not loue.\r\nSlack no time thy weding, for darth nor for cheape:\r\nthy corne shall reward it, or euer thou reape.\r\n\r\n80.\r\nThe maywede doth burne, and the thistle doth freate:\r\nthe Tine pulleth downe, both the rie and the wheate.\r\nThe dock and the brake, noieth corne very much:\r\nbut bodle for barley, no weede there is such.\r\n\r\n81.\r\nIn June washe thy shepe, where the water doth runne:\r\nand kepe them from dust, but not kepe them from sunne\r\nThen share them and spare not, at two daies anende,\r\nthe sooner, the better their bodies amende.\r\n\r\n82.\r\nRewarde not the shepe, when thou takest his cote:\r\nwith two or three patches, as brode as a grote;\r\nThe flie than and wormes, will compel it to pine:\r\nmore paine to thy cattell, more trouble is thine.\r\n\r\n83.\r\nBut share not thy lammes, till mid July be worne:\r\nthe better their cotes will be growne to be shorne.\r\nThe pie will discharge thee, for pulling the reste:\r\nthe lighter the shepe is, then fedeth it beste.\r\n\r\n84.\r\nSaint Mihel byd bees, to be brent out of strife:\r\nsajnt John bid take honey, with fauour of life.\r\nFor one sely cottage, set south good and warme:\r\ntake body and goodes, and twise yerely a swarme.\r\n\r\n85.\r\nAt Christmas take hede, if their hiues be to light:\r\ntake honey and water, together wel dight.\r\nThat mixed with strawes, in a dish in their hiues:\r\nthey drowne not, they fight not, thou sauest their lyues.\r\n\r\n86.\r\nAt midsommer downe with thy brimbles and brakes:\r\nand after abrode, with thy forkes and thy rakes.\r\nSet mowers a worke, while the meddowes be growne;\r\nthe lenger they stande, so much worse to be mowne.\r\n\r\n87.\r\nProuide of thine owne, to haue all thing at hande:\r\nels worke and the workman, shall oftentimes stande.\r\nLoue seldome to borow, that thinkest to saue;\r\nwho lendeth the one, will loke two thinges to haue.\r\n\r\n88.\r\nGood husbandes that laye, to saue all thing vpright:\r\nfor Tumbrels and cartes, haue a shed redy dight.\r\nA store house for trinkets kept close as a iayle:\r\nthat nothing be wanting, the worthe of a nayle.\r\n\r\n89.\r\nThy cartes would be searched, withoute and within;\r\nwell cloughted and greased, or hay time begin.\r\nThy hay being caried, though carters had sworne:\r\nthe cartes bottome borded, is sauing of corne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ Julii.\r\n\r\n\r\n90.\r\nThen muster thy folke, play the captaine thyselfe:\r\nprouiding them weapon, and suche kinde of pelfe.\r\nGet bottels and bagges, kepe the fielde in the heate:\r\nthe feare is not muche, but the daunger is great.\r\n\r\n91.\r\nWith tossing and raking, and setting on cox:\r\nthe grasse that was grene, is now hay for an ox.\r\nThat done, leaue the tieth, lode thy cart and awaye:\r\nthe battell is fought, thou hast gotten the daye.\r\n\r\n92.\r\nThen doune with thy hedlondes, thy corne rounde about\r\nleaue neuer a dalop, vnmoune or had out.\r\nThough grasse be but thinne, about barley and pease:\r\nyet picked vp clene, it shall do thee good ease.\r\n\r\n93.\r\nThryfallowe betime, for destroing of weede:\r\nleast thistle and dock, fall a bloming and seede.\r\nSuch season may hap, it shall stande the vpon:\r\nto till it againe, or the somer be gone.\r\n\r\n94.\r\nAnd better thou warte, so to doe for thy hast:\r\nthen (hardnes) for slougth make thy lande to lie wast.\r\nA redy good forehorse, is dainty to finde:\r\nbe hindred at first, and come alway behinde.\r\n\r\n95.\r\nThy houses and barnes, would be loked vpon:\r\nand all thing amended, or haruest come on.\r\nThinges thus set in ordre, at quiet and rest:\r\nthy haruest goeth forwarde and prospereth best.\r\n\r\n96.\r\nSainct James willeth husbandes, get reapers at hande:\r\nthe corne, being ripe doe but shead as it stande.\r\nBe sauing and thankfull, for that god hath sent:\r\nhe sendeth it thee, for the selfe same entent.\r\n\r\n97.\r\nReape well, scatter not, gather cleane that is shorne:\r\nbinde fast, shock a pase, pay the tenth of thy corne.\r\nLode salfe, carry home, lose no time, being faier:\r\ngolfe iust, in the barne, it is out of dispaier.\r\n\r\n98.\r\nThis done, set the pore ouer all for to gleane:\r\nand after thy cattel, to eate it vp cleane.\r\nThen spare it for pasture, till rowen be past:\r\nto lengthen thy dayrey, no better thou hast.\r\n\r\n99.\r\nThen welcome thy haruest folke, seruauntes and all:\r\nwith mirth and good chere, let them furnish thine hall.\r\nThe haruest lorde nightly, must geue the a song:\r\nfill him then the blacke boll, or els he hath wrong.\r\n\r\n100.\r\nThy haruest thus ended, in myrth and in ioye:\r\nplease euery one gently, man woman and boye.\r\nThus doing, with alway, such helpe as they can:\r\nthou winnest the name, of a right husband man.\r\n\r\n        _Finis._\r\n\r\nNowe thinke vpon god, let thy tonge neuer cease:\r\nfrom thanking of him, for his myghty

The alphabet was\r\ncalled the _Christ-cross-row_, some say because a cross was prefixed to\r\nthe alphabet in the old primers; but as probably from a superstitious\r\ncustom of writing the alphabet in the form of a cross as a charm. This\r\nwas even solemnly practised by the Bishop in the consecration of a\r\nchurch. See Picart's Relig. Ceremonies, vol. i. p. 131.--Nares.\r\n\r\n[E5] \"A medicine for the cowlaske.\" In Sloane MS. 1585, f. 152, will be\r\nfound a recipe for the cure of diarrhœa, the components of which appear\r\nto be the yolk of a new-laid egg, honey, and fine salt.\r\n\r\n[E6] In the edition of 1557, the first stanza of the Epistle reads\r\nsomewhat differently; see p. 220.\r\n\r\n[E7] \"Time trieth the troth,\" in Latin \"Veritas temporis filia,\" occurs\r\nin Tottel's Miscellany, 1557, repr. 1867, p. 221.--Hazlitt's English\r\nProverbs.\r\n\r\n[E8] \"Vnlesse mischance mischanceth me\" = unless fortune is unkind to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n[E9] \"Remaine abrode for euermore,\" _i.e._ be given to the writings of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[E10] It is noticeable that though in the Author's Epistle he spells\r\nhis name, most probably for convenience sake, as Tuss_a_r, he on all\r\nother occasions spells it Tuss_e_r, which is no doubt correct. In the\r\nedition of 1557 the name is spelt correctly, although the corresponding\r\nline of the stanza commences with the letter _a_. See p. 220.\r\n\r\n[E11] \"Like Iugurth, Prince of Numid.\" Jugurtha, an illegitimate son of\r\nMastanabal, after the death of Micipsa murdered his two sons and seized\r\non the sovereignty of Numidia. War was declared against him by the\r\nRomans, and after some time Metellus drove him to such extremes that\r\nhe was obliged to take refuge with his father-in-law, Bocchus, by whom\r\nhe was given up to Marius, was carried in triumph to Rome, and finally\r\nstarved to death. The history of the war against him is related in\r\nSallust's _Bellum Jugurthinum_.\r\n\r\n[E12] \"With losses so perfumid;\" _i.e._ pervaded, thoroughly imbued; we\r\nuse _imbued_ nearly in the same way.\r\n\r\n[E13] Harrison, in his Description of England (E.E.T. Soc. ed.\r\nFurnivall, part i. p. 241), gives a very bad character to the landlords\r\nof his day: \"What stocke of monie soeuer he [the farmer] gathereth and\r\nlaieth vp in all his yeares, it is often seene, that the landlord will\r\ntake such order with him for the same, when he renueth his lease, which\r\nis commonlie eight or six yeares before the old be expired (sith it\r\nis now growen almost to a custome, that if he come not to his lord so\r\nlong before, another shall step in for a reuersion, and so defeat him\r\nout right) that it shall neuer trouble him more than the haire of his\r\nbeard, when the barber hath washed and shaued it from his skin. And\r\nas they commend these, so (beside the decaie of house-keeping whereby\r\nthe poore haue beene relieued) they speake also of three things that\r\nare growen to be verie grieuous vnto them, to wit, the inhansing of\r\nrents, latelie mentioned; the dailie oppression of copiholders, whose\r\nlords seeke to bring their poore tenants almost into plaine seruitude\r\nand miserie, dailie deuising new meanes, and seeking vp all the old,\r\nhow to cut them shorter and shorter, _doubling, trebling, and now and\r\nthen seuen times increasing their fines_; driuing them also for euerie\r\ntrifle to loose and forfeit their tenures, (by whom the greatest part\r\nof the realme dooth stand and is mainteined,) to the end they may\r\nfleece them yet more.\" See also Norden's Surveyor's Dialogue, ed. 1607,\r\np. 51.\r\n\r\nThe following curious prayer is in Edward the Sixth's Liturgies:--\"The\r\nearth is Thine, O Lord, and all that is contained therein,\r\nnotwithstanding Thou hast given possession of it to the children of\r\nmen, to pass over the time of their short pilgrimage in this vale of\r\nmisery. We heartily pray Thee to send Thy Holy Spirit into the hearts\r\nof those that possess the grounds, pastures, and dwelling-places of the\r\nearth, that they, remembering themselves to be Thy tenants, may not\r\nrack nor stretch out the rents of their houses and lands, nor yet take\r\nunreasonable fines and incomes after the manner of covetous worldlings,\r\nbut so let them out to others, that the inhabitants thereof may both\r\nbe able to pay the rents, and also honestly to live and nourish their\r\nfamilies, and relieve the poor. Give them grace also to consider that\r\nthey are but strangers and pilgrims in this world, having here no\r\ndwelling-place, but seeking one to come; that they, remembering the\r\nshort continuance of their life, may be contented with that which\r\nis sufficient, and not join house to house and land to land, to the\r\nimpoverishment of others; but so behave themselves in letting out\r\ntheir lands, tenements, and pastures, that after this life they may be\r\nreceived into everlasting dwelling-places, through, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[E14] \"Fleeces\" = fleecings, frauds, impositions. It _may_, perhaps, be\r\nused literally, of selling wool at a loss.\r\n\r\n[E15] \"Ictus sapit.\" This corresponds to our proverb, \"The burnt child\r\ndreads the fire,\" or perhaps more nearly to \"Once bit, twice shy.\"\r\nIn the \"Proverbs of Hendyng\" we find it as: \"The burnt child fire\r\ndreadeth, quoth Hendyng.\" Ray, in his \"Collection of Proverbs,\" edit.\r\n1737, says: \"Piscator ictus sapit; struck by the scorpion fish, or\r\npastinaca, whose prickles are esteemed venomous.\"\r\n\r\n[E16] If Tusser is here writing literally, the price of his book, in\r\n\"the golden days of good Queen Bess,\" was only a groat or two at the\r\nutmost.--M.\r\n\r\n[E17] \"Shere\" = shire; the construction is--don't think that _every_\r\nbit of land (or county) can profit by following my directions, for\r\nsoils differ. Compare chapter 19, stanza 8, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[E18] \"Must keepe such coile;\" must bustle about, exert themselves. Cf.\r\nScott's \"Lord of the Isles,\" canto v. stanza 1: \"For wake where'er he\r\nmay, man wakes to care and _coil_.\" And Shakspere: \"I pray you watch\r\nabout Signor Leonata's door; for the wedding being there to-morrow,\r\nthere is a great _coil_ to-night.\"\r\n\r\n[E19] In the edition of 1570 the first stanza of the \"Preface to the\r\nBuier\" reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"What lookest thou herein to haue?\r\n  Trim verses thy fansie to please?\r\nOf Surry so famous that craue,\r\n  Looke nothing but rudenes in these.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference in the third line being to Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey,\r\nauthor of the Translation of the second and fourth Books of the Æneid\r\nof Virgil, and of numerous other poems, who was executed in 1547.\r\n\r\n[E20] In the footnote to this Preface it is stated that the metre is\r\npeculiar to Shenstone, but this is incorrect, as it is also used by\r\nPrior: \"Despairing beside a clear stream.\"\r\n\r\n[E21] \"The sea for my fish,\" _i.e._ for my fishpond.\r\n\r\n[E22] With \"The Ladder to Thrift\" we may compare the following \"Maxims\r\nin _-ly_,\" from the Lansdowne MS. 762, f. 16_b_ (see Babees Book, ed.\r\nFurnivall, p. 247):\r\n\r\n\"Aryse erly,\r\nSerue God devowtely,\r\nAnd the worlde besely,\r\nDoo thy werk wisely,\r\nYeue thyne almes secretly,\r\nGoo by the waye sadly,\r\nAnswer the people demuerly,\r\nGoo to thy mete appetitely,\r\nSit therat discretely,\r\nOf thy tunge be not to liberally,\r\nArise therfrom temperally,\r\nGo to thy supper soberly,\r\nAnd to thy bed merely,\r\nBe in thyn Inne jocundely,\r\nPlease thy loue duely,\r\nAnd slepe suerly.\"\r\n\r\n[E23] \"Familie,\" here used in the sense of the Latin original _familia_\r\n= household, servants.

Hebrews xiii. 4: \"Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed\r\nundefiled.\" Tusser evidently does not appreciate \"love in a cottage.\"\r\n\r\n[E28] \"Giue ouer to sudgerne, that thinkest to thee;\" _i.e._ make up\r\nyour mind to settle down in one place and to give up roaming about, if\r\nyou hope to prosper, lest the grumbling of your hosts and the wants of\r\nthe nurses prove too expensive for you. Compare \"The Dialogue of Wiving\r\nand Thriving,\" ch. 67 stanza 3, p. 152.\r\n\r\n[E29] Dr. Mavor suggests that the third line of this stanza should\r\nread: \"Of tone _or_ them both,\" \"meaning, if we smell the savour of\r\nsaving or winning or them both.\"\r\n\r\n[E30] A fool and his money are soon parted.\r\n\r\n[E31] \"Good bargaine a dooing,\" etc. When you have a chance of making\r\na good bargain, don't let every one know; but when you want to sell\r\nanything, then let it be published abroad as widely as possible.

J. S. in Notes and Queries, 1st Ser. i. 170,\r\nadds that it is a common proverb in Yorkshire. Fuller states that the\r\nsaying arose from \"Thomas Stafford, who in the reign of Mary, A.D.\r\n1557, with a small company, seized on Scarborough Castle, and before\r\nthe townspeople had the least notice of their approach.\" Another\r\nexplanation is that, if ships passed the castle without saluting\r\nit, a shotted gun was fired at them. In a ballad by Heywood another\r\nderivation is given:\r\n\r\n\"This term _Scarborow warning_ grew (some say)\r\n  By hasty hanging for rank robbery theare.\r\nWho that was met, but suspect in that way,\r\n  Strait he was trust up, whatever he were.\"\r\n\r\nThis implies that Scarborough imitated the Halifax gibbet law.--N.&\r\nQ. 1st Ser. i. 138. In a letter by Toby Matthew, Bishop of Durham, to\r\nthe Archbishop of York, Jan. 19, 1603, he writes: \"When I was in the\r\nmidst of this discourse I received a message from my Lord Chamberlain\r\nthat it was his Majesty's pleasure that I should preach before him\r\non Sunday next, which _Scarborough warning_ did not only perplex me,\r\nbut so puzzel me as no mervail if somewhat be prætermitted, which\r\notherwise I might have better remembered.\"--N. & Q. 4th Ser. xii. 408.\r\n\"_Scarborough warning_. The antiquity of the phrase is shown by its\r\noccurrence in Puttenham's 'Arte of English Poetrie,' ed. 1589. The\r\nfollowing is the passage, from p. 199 of Arber's reprint: [We have]\r\n'many such prouerbiall speeches: as, _Totnesse is turned French_, for\r\na strange alteration: _Skarborow warning_, for a sodaine commandement,\r\nallowing no respect or delay to bethinke a man of his busines.'\"--Note\r\nby Rev.

Compare _Preste_ = a loan,\r\n_Pretoes_ = loans, in Halliwell. A lender hates to hear a man say\r\n_Præsta_.\r\n\r\n[E45] The word \"collects\" is used here in its original meaning of short\r\nprayers; thus the prayers before the Epistle and Gospel in the Prayer\r\nBook are called Collects, as containing briefly the lessons of the\r\nEpistle and Gospel.\r\n\r\n[E46] \"Nor put to thy hand,\" etc.; that is, do not meddle in the\r\nbusiness of other people, and be careful whom you assist, lest by being\r\ntoo free and generous you yourself may be put to inconvenience. Ray\r\ngives: \"Put not thy hand between the bark and the tree,\" that is, do\r\nnot meddle in family affairs.\r\n\r\n[E47] Tusser here, while acknowledging the necessity and advantages of\r\nthe practice of \"giving credit\" in business, impresses strongly upon\r\nhis readers the dishonesty and danger of promiscuous borrowing and\r\nlending, either to relations or friends, winding up with the advice\r\nnever to trust a man who has once broken his engagements, without a\r\nsurety, and never to lend a second time to a man who is angry with you\r\nfor asking for payment of what he already owes.\r\n\r\n[E48] \"The foole at the bottom, the wise at the brim;\" referring to\r\nthe proverb, \"Better spare at brim than at bottom,\" that is, \"Better\r\nbe frugal in youth, than be reduced to the necessity of being saving\r\nin age.\" Ray also gives another proverb of a similar character,\r\n\"'Tis too late to spare when the bottom is dry.\" \"Sera in fundo\r\nparsimonia.\"--Seneca, Epist. i.\r\n\r\n[E49] \"Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.\" Cf.

In the autumn as much meat was cured as would last\r\nthe winter; and until the pastures had been for some time abundant,\r\nthat is, not until Midsummer, there were no means of fattening cattle.\r\nAfter the winter months, veal and bacon were welcomed as the precursors\r\nof fresh beef; and those who lived near the sea-coast enjoyed the\r\naddition of fresh fish; but the state of the roads prevented the inland\r\nparts of the country partaking of this benefit. The consumption of fish\r\nduring Lent and on other fast-days, comprising a great part of the\r\nyear, being expressly directed by statute, the people, even after the\r\nabolition of the old religion, provided themselves at several large\r\nfairs held almost expressly for the sale and distribution of salt-fish.\r\n\r\n[E59] \"Veale and Bakon is the man,\" _i.e._ is the proper food, or is in\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n[E60] \"Martilmas beef,\" beef killed at Martinmas, and dried for\r\nwinter use. \"Biefe salted, dried up in the chimney, Martlemas\r\nbiefe.\"--Hollyband's Dict. 1593.

The _straw-fork_ and _rake_ were to turn the\r\nstraw from off the threshed corn, and the _fan_ and _wing_ to clean\r\nit. A _cartnave_ might be required to stand on in this operation.

Piers Plowman, C.\r\nText, Passus ix. 61: \"A boussel of _bredcorne_.\"\r\n\r\n[E111] Hazlitt gives as a proverb: \"To play the devil in the bulmong.\"\r\nAn acre of bullimong land was worth 33_s._ 4_d._; see note E370.\r\n\r\n[E112] According to Norden (Surveyor's Dialogue, 1607, p. 239) the\r\nbest mode of making a quickset hedge is as follows: \"The plants of\r\nwhitethorne, mixed here and there with oke and ash\"; if the plants\r\nare not easily procured, then \"the berries of the white or hawthorne,\r\nacornes, ash keyes mixed together, and these wrought or wound up in a\r\nrope of straw, wil serve, but they will be somewhat longer in growing.\r\nMake a trench at the top or in the edge of the ditch, and lay into it\r\nsome fat soyle, and then lay the rope all along the ditch, and cover\r\nit with good soile also, then cover it with the earth, and ever as any\r\nweedes or grasse begins to grow, pull it off and keepe it as cleane as\r\nmay be from all hindrances, and when the seeds begin to come, keepe\r\ncattle from bruising them, and after some two or three yeares, cut the\r\nyong spring by the earth, and so will they branch and grow thick, and\r\nif occasion serve, cut them so again alwayes, preserving the oake and\r\nashe to become trees.\" The best time to lay the berries in this manner\r\nis \"in _September_ or _October_, if the berries be fully ripe.\"\r\n\r\n[E113] A \"porkling\" was worth 28_d._ at the time. See note E370.\r\n\r\n[E114] With reference to the \"daintiness\" of the Flemings, many of whom\r\nwere settled on the East coast, compare the following:\r\n\r\n\"Now bere and _bacon_ bene fro Pruse ibrought\r\nInto Flaundres, as loved and fere isoughte;\r\nOsmonde [a kind of iron], coppre, bowstaffes, stile [steel], and wex,\r\nPeltre-ware [hides], and grey, pych, terre, borde, and flex,\r\nAnd Coleyne threde, fustiane, and canvase,\r\nCorde, bokeram; of olde tyme thus it wase.\r\nBut the _Flemmyngis_, amonge these thinges dere,\r\nIn comen lowen [love] beste _bacon_ and bere.\r\nThus arre they hogges; and drynkyn wele ataunt [so much];\r\nFarewel, Flemynge! hay, harys, hay, avaunt!\"\r\n  --Wright's Political Songs, ii. 171.\r\n\r\n[E115] _Light fire_, as it is termed, is still used in Norfolk.--M.\r\n\r\n[E116] \"Bowd eaten malt.\" \"The more it be dried (yet must it be doone\r\nwith soft fire) the sweeter and better the malt is, and the longer it\r\nwill continue, whereas if it be not dried downe (as they call it), but\r\nslackelie handled, it will breed a kind of worme, called a _wiuell_,\r\nwhich groweth in the floure of the corne, and in processe of time will\r\nso eat out it selfe, that nothing shall remaine of the graine but euen\r\nthe verie rind or huske.\"--Harrison, Description of England, part i.\r\npp. 156-7. R. Holme says that \"the Wievell eateth and devoureth corn\r\nin the garners; they are of some people called _bowds_.\"--Acad. of\r\nArm. Bk. ii. p. 467. \"Bruk is a maner of flye, short and brodissh,\r\nand in a sad husc, blak hed, in shap mykel toward a golde _bowde_,\r\nand mykhede [size] of twyis and þryis atte moste of a gold _bowde_, a\r\nchouere, oþer vulgal can y non þerfore.\"--Arundel MS. 42, f. 64.

Parv.\r\n\r\n[E117] See note E5 on \"A Medicine for the Cowlaske.\" Sloes gently\r\nbaked in an oven are best preserved. They are an excellent and cheap\r\nremedy for laxity of the bowels, in men or cattle, if judiciously\r\nused.--M.\r\n\r\n[E118] Dr. Mavor suggests that as Tusser is pretty correct in his\r\nrhymes, he probably wrote _beasty_ originally. In Pegge's Forme of\r\nCury, 1780, p. 111, are given two recipes for the prevention of\r\n_Restyng_ in Venisoun.\r\n\r\n[E119] \"Stouer.\" _Stover_ is the term now applied to the coarser hay\r\nmade of clover and artificial grasses, which is kept for the winter\r\nfeed of cattle. But in Shakespeare's time the artificial grasses were\r\nnot known in England, and were not introduced till about the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century. In Cambridgeshire I am informed that hay made\r\nin this manner is not called \"stover\" till the seeds have been threshed\r\nout. In the sixteenth century the word was apparently used to denote\r\nany kind of winter fodder except grass hay. Compare\r\n\r\n\"Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\r\nAnd flat meads thatch'd with _stover_, them to keep.\"\r\n  --Shakspere, Tempest, Act iv. sc. I;\r\n\r\nand Drayton, Polyolbion, xxv. 145,\r\n\r\n\"And others from their Carres, are busily about,\r\nTo draw out Sedge and Reed, for Thatch and _Stover_ fit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stover\" is enumerated by Ray among the South-and East-Country words as\r\nused in Essex, and is to be found in Moor's Suffolk Words and Forby's\r\nVocabulary of East Anglia.\r\n\r\n[E120] See note E61.\r\n\r\n[E121] In cleaning corn for _seed, casting_ or throwing it with a\r\n_casting shovel_ (see 17. 1) from one heap to another, in order to\r\nselect the heaviest grains, which will always go farthest, is an\r\nexcellent practice: but in _malting_, this is not necessary, as the\r\nlight grains and seeds of weeds may be skimmed off in the cistern.--M.\r\n\r\n[E122] Wheat is well known to work better in grinding and baking after\r\nit has undergone a natural heat in the rick or mow. Wheat that is\r\nthreshed early keeps with difficulty.--M.\r\n\r\n[E123] \"Rauening curres\" seem to have been as great a nuisance in\r\nTusser's time as at present, in spite of what Dr. Mavor terms one of\r\nthe \"few patriotic taxes which we have to boast of.\"\r\n\r\n[E124] St. Edmund's Day (20th November) may probably be the proper time\r\nfor planting garlic and beans; but why the moon should be \"in the wane\"\r\nwe are not informed, though, according to Tusser, \"thereon hangeth a\r\nthing.\" The moon was formerly supposed to extend her power over all\r\nnature, and not over the tides and weather only.\r\n\r\n[E125] The farmer who \"looks to thrive\" must \"have an eye,\" not only\r\nto his barn, but also to the cruel habits or tricks of his servants;\r\notherwise he may find his cattle maimed or otherwise injured, and his\r\npoultry made \"to plaie tapple vp taile,\" a cant expression, meaning\r\nto tumble head over heels. Cf. the Scotch phrase, \"coup your creels.\"\r\nCotgrave, _s.v. Laisser_ and _Houseau_, has an exactly parallel\r\nexpression: \"_Il a laissé ses houseaux_, he hath tipped up the heeles,\r\nor is ready to doe it; he hath got him to his last bed; he is even as\r\ngood as gone; he is no better then a dead man.\" The Catholicon Anglicum\r\nalso gives \"Top ouer tayle, _precipitanter_: to cast tope ouer tayle,\r\n_precipitari_.\"\r\n\r\n[E126] The leathern bottle, from its size, must have been a most\r\nconvenient vehicle for the removal of corn and other stolen property.\r\n\r\n[E127] Our author does not appear to have had any idea of the use of\r\nsoot as a top-dressing to land, but its value is now well understood,\r\nas one of the greatest improvers of cold, mossy grasslands.\r\n\r\n[E128] It is leanness and ill-dressing that occasion nits and lice, not\r\nthe state of the weather when they are taken to house.\r\n\r\n[E129] The rack ought to be accessible on all sides, and perhaps high\r\nenough for small cattle to escape under it from their more powerful\r\nadversaries.--M.\r\n\r\n[E130] \"_Barth_.\" Wedgwood includes this under _berth_, the seaman's\r\nterm for snug anchorage for themselves or their vessels.

The parties, 10 to 15 aside, stand in line\r\nfacing their own goals and each other, at 10 yards distance, midway\r\nbetween the goals and nearest that of their adversaries. An indifferent\r\nspectator throws up the ball--the size of a cricket ball--midway\r\nbetween the confronted players, whose object is to seize and convey\r\nit between their own goals. The shock of the first onset to catch the\r\nfalling ball is very great, and the player who seizes it speeds home\r\npursued by his opponents, through whom he has to make his way, aided by\r\nthe jostlings of his own sidesmen. If caught and held, or in imminent\r\ndanger of it, he _throws_ the ball, but must in no case _give_ it, to\r\na comrade, who, if it be not arrested in its course, or he be jostled\r\naway by his eager foes, catches it, and hurries home, winning the\r\ngame or _snotch_ if he contrive to _carry, not throw_, it between the\r\ngoals. A holder of the ball caught with it in his possession loses\r\na _snotch_. At the loss of each of these the game recommences after\r\na breathing time. Seven or nine _snotches_ are the game, and these\r\nit will sometimes take two or three hours to win. Sometimes a large\r\nfootball was used, and the game was then called \"_kicking camp_,\" and\r\nif played with the shoes on, \"_savage camp_.\"--Abridged from Major\r\nMoor's Description.\r\n\r\nRay says it prevailed, in his time, most in Norfolk, Suffolk, and\r\nEssex. It was new to Sir T. Browne on his settling in Norfolk, and is\r\nnot mentioned by Strutt amongst the \"Sports and Pastimes of the English\r\nPeople.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spurdens, in his Supplement to Forby's Vocabulary, remarks: \"The\r\ncontests were not unfrequently fatal to many of the combatants. I have\r\nheard old persons speak of a celebrated _Camping_, Norfolk against\r\nSuffolk, on Diss Common, with 300 on each side. Before the ball was\r\nthrown up, the Norfolk men inquired tauntingly of the Suffolk men if\r\nthey had brought their coffins. The Suffolk men after fourteen hours\r\nwere the victors. Nine deaths were the result of the contest within\r\na fortnight. These were called _fighting camps_, for much boxing was\r\npractised in them.\" Cf.\r\n\r\n\"This faire floure of womanheed\r\n  Hath two pappys also smalle,\r\nBolsteryd out of lenghth and breed,\r\n  Lyche a large _Campyng ball_.\"\r\n  --Lydgate.\r\n\r\n_Camping Land_ was a piece of ground set apart for the game. A field\r\nabutting on the churchyard at Swaffham was willed for the purpose\r\nby the Rector in 1472. At East Bilney and Stowmarket are pieces of\r\nground still called _Camping land_. Sir John Cullum, in his \"History\r\nof Hawstead, Suffolk,\" describes the _Camping-pightle_ as mentioned\r\nA.D. 1466. \"_Campar_ or _pleyar_ at foott balle, _campyon_ or\r\n_champyon_.\"--Prompt.

Shakspere,\r\nAs you Like it, Act ii. sc. 7: \"All the world's a stage,\" etc., and\r\nMerchant of Venice, Act i. sc. 1, where Antonio calls the world\r\n\"A stage where every man must play a part.\" \"Totus mundus agit\r\nhistrionem,\" from a fragment of Petronius, is said to have been the\r\nmotto on the Globe Theatre. Calderon wrote a play called El Teatro del\r\nMundo (The Theatre of the World). It is remarkable for containing the\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n\"En el teatro del mundo\r\nTodos son representantes,\"\r\n\r\n_i.e._ in the stage of the world all men are players.--W. W. S. In the\r\nold play of Damon and Pythias (Dodsley's Old Plays, ed. Hazlitt, iv.\r\n31) the following occurs:\r\n\r\n\"Pythagoras said that this world was like a stage,\r\nWhere many play their parts: the lookers on, the sage\r\nPhilosophers are, said he, whose part is to learn\r\nThe manners of all nations, and the good from the bad to discern.\"\r\n\r\nThe same comparison occurs also in Don Quixote, part ii. cap. 12. See\r\nnote E378.\r\n\r\n[E135] Psalm cxliv. 4.\r\n\r\n[E136] \"Atrop.\" \"The fatall sisters,\" Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos,\r\ndaughters of Erebus and the Night, were supposed to spin out the life\r\nof man as it were a long thread, which they drew out in length, till\r\nhis fatal hour had arrived; but if by any other casualty his days were\r\nshortened, then _Atropos_ was said to have cut the thread in two. Hence\r\nthe old verse: \"Clotho colum bajulat, Lachesis trahit, Atropos occat.\"\r\n\r\n[E137] \"Euer among,\" an expression of frequent occurrence in Early\r\nEnglish, meaning \"constantly, continually.\" Compare the Mod.

The _May\r\nCherries_ are tender, and the trees must be set in a warm place. The\r\n_Black-hart Cherry_, a very speciall fruit, and a great bearing fruit,\r\nand doubtlesse exceeding proper to presse for wine either to drink of\r\nitselfe, or to mix the juyce with _Cider_ to give it a _colour_ as\r\n_Clarret-wine_, it being of a deepe red, and a small quantity of it\r\nwill colour a gallon of _Cider_ or _White wine_. There is a _Cherry_\r\nwe call the _great bearing Cherry_ of M. Milleu. It may very well be\r\ncalled the _great bearer_, for the trees seldome fayle of great store\r\nof fruits, although in a cold and sharp spring.\"\r\n\r\n[E149] \"Chestnuts.\" Often spelt, but improperly, _chesnut_, as though\r\nthe _cheese_-like nut.

This equivocal word was misunderstood and\r\ntaken in its other sense of 'frizzle-berry,' and translated into German\r\nand herbalist Latin as '_kraüsel-beere_,' and '_uva crispa_.'

There are many kinds of Vines, but I know none so\r\ngood, and fit for our climate as the _Parsley Vine_ or Canada Grape, we\r\nsee by experience yearly it beares abundance of fruit unto perfection.\r\nAnd whosoever would plant Vines in England I think he cannot meet\r\nwith a better kind than the _Parsley Vine_ both for _bearing_ and\r\n_goodnesse_. The _Fox grape_ is a faire _large Fruit_ and a very\r\n_great bearer_ although not of so much esteem as divers others. The\r\n_Frantiniack Grape_ is of great accompt with many, and is a speciall\r\nfruit where it comes to perfect ripenesse, which it hardly does, except\r\nthe Vine be set upon the _South-wall_ where it may have _much sun_.\r\nThe _Red_ and _White Muskadine Grape_ are speciall fruits and beare\r\nvery well, and come to perfect ripenesse if the Vine grow upon the\r\n_South-wall_ or upon the _Easte-wall_ which is best next.

The whole stanza is somewhat enigmatical. The\r\nearlier editions read uniformly: \"by the hay,\" etc., but the more\r\nmodern have: \"buy thee hay,\" etc., which is probably the correct\r\nreading.

Primerole, as an outlandish unintelligible word, was soon\r\nfamiliarized into _prime rolles_, and this into _primrose_. This is\r\nexplained in popular works as meaning the first rose of the spring,\r\na name that never could have been given to a plant that in form and\r\ncolour is so unlike a rose. But the rightful claimant is, strange\r\nto say, the _daisy_, which in the South of Europe is a common and\r\nconspicuous flower in early spring, while the _primrose_ is an\r\nextremely rare one, and it is the _daisy_ that bears the name in\r\nall the old books. See Fuchs, Hist. Stirpium, 1542, p. 145, where\r\nthere is an excellent figure of it, titled _primula veris_; and the\r\nOrtus Sanitatis, ed. Augsb. 1486, ch. cccxxxiii., where we have a\r\nvery good woodcut of a daisy titled \"masslieben, _Premula veris_,\r\nLatine.\" Brunfelsius, Novum Herbarium, ed. 1531, speaking of the\r\nHerba paralysis, the cowslip, says, p. 1590, expressly, \"Sye würt von\r\netlichen Doctores _Primula veris_ genaunt, das doch falsch ist wann\r\n_Primula veris_ ist matsomen oder zeitlosen.\" Brunschwygk (De Arte\r\nDistillandi, 1500, book ii. c. viii.) uses the same words. The Zeitlose\r\nis the daisy. Parkinson (Th. Bot. p. 531) assigns the name to both the\r\ndaisy and the primrose. Matthioli (ed. Frankfort, 1586, p. 653) calls\r\nhis Bellis Major \"_Primo fiore maggiore_, seu _Fiore di prima vera_,\r\nnonnullis _Primula veris major_\" and figures the moon-daisy. His Bellis\r\nminor, which seems to be our daisy, he calls \"_Primo fiore minore,\r\nFior di primavera_, Gallis _Marguerites_, Germanis _Masslieben_.\" At\r\np. 883, he figures the cowslip, and calls that also \"_Primula veris_,\r\nItalis _Fiore di primavera_, Gallis _primevere_.\"--Dr. Prior's Pop.\r\nNames of British Plants. \"_Petie Mulleyn_ (whiche we call _Cowslippe_\r\nand _Primerose_) is of two sortes.

It has received more popular names perhaps\r\nthan any other plant, both in our own and in foreign languages.

It is still sometimes grown in gardens for use in the\r\nabove-mentioned manner. According to Cogan (Haven of Health, p. 71), it\r\nwill cure the bite of a mad dog.\r\n\r\n[E262] According to Cogan \"Cummin\" was extensively used for washing\r\nthe face, it having the effect, if not used too often, of making the\r\ncomplexion clear; if used to excess, it caused paleness.

There were numerous other superstitions\r\nregarding this plant; amongst others it was said to shriek when torn\r\nup. See Gerard's Herbal, 1597, p. 280, and Peacock's Glossary of\r\nManley, etc., E. D. Soc. Lupton (Book of Notable Things, iii. 39) gives\r\ninstructions for the manufacture of Mandrakes from bryony roots. The\r\ntrue Mandrake is _Atropa Mandragora_, Linn.\r\n\r\n[E267] Mogwort. \"Mugwort, a name that corresponds in meaning with its\r\nsynonym _wyrmwyrt_, wormwood, from O.E. _mough, moghe_, or _moughte_, a\r\nmaggot or moth.\r\n\r\n'And wormes and _moghes_ on þe same manere\r\nSal þat day be in wittenes broght;'\r\n  --Hampole, Pricke of Conscience, l. 5572;\r\n\r\nand Wycliffe (Matt. vi. 20):\r\n\r\n'Where neþer ruste ne _moughte_ destruyeþ.'\r\n\r\nThe name was given to this plant from its having been recommended by\r\nDioscorides to ward off the attacks of these insects.

Lodge, p. 154.\r\n\r\nWith these extracts showing the essentials of good cheese, compare\r\nthe following description of Suffolk Cheese, locally termed _Bang and\r\nThump_, and made of milk several times skimmed:\r\n\r\n\"Unrivall'd stands thy county cheese, O Giles!\r\nWhose very name alone engenders smiles;\r\nWhose fame abroad by every tongue is spoke,\r\nThe well-known butt of many a flinty joke,\r\nIts name derision and reproach pursue,\r\nAnd strangers tell of 'three times skimm'd skye blue.'\"\r\n  --Blomfield.\r\n\r\nIts toughness has given rise to a number of local illustrations. In one\r\nthe cheese exclaims:\r\n\r\n\"Those that made me were uncivil,\r\nFor they made me harder than the devil;\r\nKnives won't cut me; fire won't sweat me;\r\nDogs bark at me, but can't eat me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hunger will break through stone walls, or anything except Suffolk\r\ncheese,\" is a proverb from Ray. Mowbray says \"it is only fit to be cut\r\nup for gate latches, a use to which it is often applied.\" Other writers\r\nrepresent it as most suitable for making wheels for wheelbarrows.\r\n\r\n[E293] \"Argusses eies.\" The mythical Argus, surnamed Panoptes (the\r\nAll-seer), had a hundred eyes; he was placed by Juno to guard Io, and\r\nat his death his eyes were transplanted to the peacock's tail.\r\n\r\n[E294] To fleet or skim the cream is a verb still in use in\r\nEast Anglia, and the utensil used for the purpose is termed a\r\n_fleeting-dish_. \"I flete mylke, take away the creame that lyeth above\r\nit whan it hath rested.\"--Palsgr. \"_Esburrer_, to fleet the creame\r\npotte; _laict esburré_, fleeted milk; _maigne_, fleeted milke or\r\nwhaye.\"--Hollyband's Treasurie. \"Ye _floted_ too nie\" = you skimmed off\r\ntoo much of the cream.\r\n\r\n[E295] If cheeses are full of eyes, it is a proof that the curd was not\r\nproperly worked.\r\n\r\n[E296] Hoven cheese is occasioned by negligence in breaking the curd;\r\nand therefore Cisley deserves to be driven to _creeks_, or holes and\r\ncorners, for her idleness and inattention.--M.\r\n\r\n[E297] Tough or leathery cheese may arise from its being set too hot,\r\nor not worked up, and the curd broken in proper time.--M.\r\n\r\n[E298] Various causes may bring on corruption in cheese, such as the\r\nuse of beastings, or milk immediately after calving, moisture, bruises\r\nand such like.\r\n\r\n[E299] Hairs in cheese can only arise from inexcusable carelessness, or\r\nfrom Cisley's combing and decking her hair in the dairy.\r\n\r\n[E300] Magget the py = the magpie, a pun on the word magget, in its two\r\nmeanings of 1. a maggot, 2. a magpie, commonly called in Prov. Eng.\r\n_magot-pie, maggoty-pie_, from _mag, maggot = Meg, Maggie = Margery,\r\nMargaret_, and _pie_; Fr. _margot_, old dimin. of _Marguerite_,\r\nand common name of the magpie. The line, therefore, reads, \"If\r\nmaggots be crawling in the cheese, fetch magget the py.\" \"_Pie_,\r\nmeggatapie.\"--Cotgrave. Cf. Shakspere, Macbeth, Act iii. sc. 4, 125.\r\n\r\n[E301] \"Cisley, in running after the Bishop in passing, as was the\r\npractice in former times, in order to obtain his blessing, might\r\naccidentally leave her milk on the fire; and on her return, finding\r\nit burnt to the pan, might probably curse the prelate for her mishap,\r\nwhich conduct deserved correction, or a left-handed blessing from her\r\nmistress.\" So Dr. Mavor. Mr. Skeat remarks in reference to it: \"That\r\nstupid story makes me cross; it is such an evident invention, and no\r\nsoul has ever adduced the faintest proof of any such practice. The\r\nallusion is far less circuitous, viz. to the bishops who burnt people\r\nfor heresy. That they did so is too notorious.\" The following extract\r\nappears strongly to bear out Mr. Skeat's view: \"When a thynge speadeth\r\nnot well we borowe speach and say '_the byshope hath blessed it_,'\r\nbecause that nothynge speadeth well that they medyll withall. If the\r\npodech be burned to, or the meate over rosted, we say '_the byshope has\r\nput his fote in the potte_,' or '_the byshope hath played the coke_,'\r\nbecause the byshopes burn who they lust, and whosoever displeaseth\r\nthem.\"--Quotation from Tyndale's Obedyence of a Chrystene Man, 1528, p.\r\n166, in Brockett, North Country Glossary, 1825, page 16. If we consider\r\nthat these verses were written while the memory of the numbers who had\r\nsuffered death at the stake for their religion was still fresh in the\r\nminds of the people, Mr. Skeat's view, borne out, as it is, by the\r\nforegoing extract, certainly appears the more reasonable and probable.\r\n\r\n[E302] \"Here reede\": we may take this as meaning either \"here read,\"\r\nor, adopting the older meaning of the word _reede_ (A.S. _ræd_ =\r\nadvice, warning), as \"hear my advice or warning.\"\r\n\r\n[E303] \"Take nothing to halues,\" that is, do nothing by halves.\r\n\r\n[E304] \"Tell fagot and billet,\" etc.; count your faggots and fire-wood,\r\nto prevent the boys and girls from pilfering it, so that when you come\r\nto fetch it you find \"a quarter be gone.\" So also in the next stanza,\r\nwatch the coal men filling the sacks, lest you should get short weight;\r\nand, when the coals are delivered, see the sacks opened, for fear the\r\ncoal dealer and the carman should be 'two in a pack,' or 'harp on one\r\nstring,' and between them you be defrauded.\r\n\r\n[E305] \"Philip and Jacob,\" that is, St. Philip and St. James' Day, May\r\n1st. \"When flocks were more uniform as to breed and management, lambs\r\nused to be separated from their dams on this day, for the purpose of\r\ntithing as well as milking.\"--M. \"Requiem æternam,\" a portion of the\r\nRoman Catholic Service for the dead, hence \"least _requiem æternam_ in\r\nwinter they sing\" = lest they die in the winter from not having been\r\nallowed to become sufficiently strong before being taken from their\r\ndams, and thus being incapable of enduring the severity of the weather.\r\n\r\n[E306] \"Barberlie handled,\" that is, \"_secundum artem_, as a barber\r\nsurgeon would do, by first cutting away extraneous substances, and\r\nthen rubbing the part with dust.\"--M.

In former\r\ndays thistles were gathered from the corn for the feeding of cattle,\r\nand the left hand of the reaper was guarded with a leathern glove:\r\nthere is an entry among the expenses of the Priory of Holy Island for\r\n1344-5 of \"gloves for 14 servants when they gathered the tythe corn,\r\n2_s._ 8_d._\" See Johnston's \"Botany of the Eastern Borders.\"--Note by\r\nMr. J. Britten, F.L.S.\r\n\r\n[E310] \"The May weed doth burn\" (_Anthemis cotula_, L.). The juice of\r\nthis plant is possessed of an acrid blistering property which renders\r\nit extremely noxious to reapers. The irritating effects are produced in\r\na still greater degree by the seed when ripe, and are mostly manifested\r\nin the lower extremities, from the close adhesion of the seeds by\r\ntheir rough surface, aided by the friction of the shoe, causing first\r\nabrasion, then active inflammation, and even ulceration. Dr. Bromfield\r\n(Flora Vectensis) says: \"I have been repeatedly assured by the\r\npeasantry that they have known men incapacitated for work, and laid up,\r\nfrom the injurious operation of this noxious weed, for days together in\r\nharvest time.\"\r\n\r\n[E311] \"The thistle doth fret.\" Fitzherbert (Boke of Husbandry) says:\r\n\"The thystell is an yll wede rough and sharpe to handle, and _freateth\r\naway the cornes_ nyghe it.\"\r\n\r\n[E312] \"The fitches pul downward.\" The hairy tare, _Vicia hirsuta_, L.\r\nFitch = vetch.\r\n\r\n[E313] \"The cockle,\" _Lychnis Githago_, L. \"_Cockole_ hath a large smal\r\n[_sic_] leafe and wyll beare v or vi floures purple colloure as brode\r\nas a grote, and the sede is rounde and blacke.\"--Fitzherbert, Boke of\r\nHusbandry.\r\n\r\n[E314] \"Boddle.\" The corn marigold, _Chrysanthemum segetum_, L., more\r\nusually called boodle or buddle in the East of England; in Kent, yellow\r\nbottle; in Scotland, gools, gules, or goolds, in allusion to the colour\r\nof the flower. This is a very noxious weed, the non-extirpation of\r\nwhich in Scotland was formerly a punishable offence: certain persons\r\n(hence called \"gool-riders\") were appointed to ride through the fields\r\non a certain day, and impose a fine of three shillings and fourpence,\r\nor a wether sheep, for every stalk of the plant found growing in the\r\ncorn. The custom is of great antiquity, and exists in a modified form\r\nat the present day, the fine being reduced to a penny. Linnæus states\r\nthat a similar law exists in Denmark.--Note by Mr. J.

F. J.

It occurs in the Life of Alexander\r\n(formerly, but erroneously, attributed to Adam Davie), written in 1312,\r\nwhere the words are:\r\n\r\n\"Swithe mury hit is in halle,\r\nWhen burdes wawen alle.\"\r\n  --Weber's Met. Rom.\r\n\r\nIt occurs also in Shakspere, 2 Henry IV. Act v. sc. 3, and is quoted in\r\nthe _Merie Tales of Skelton_, 1567. See also Ray's Proverbs.\r\n\r\n[E353] \"For Mihelmas spring,\" that is, \"for fear of injuring the young\r\nplants, etc., at Michaelmas.\"\r\n\r\n[E354] In Harrison's Descript. of England, Part II. p. 50 _et\r\nseq._, there is a long chapter on the cultivation and uses of Saffron\r\nin England, from which I extract the following: \"As the Saffron of\r\nEngland, which Platina reckneth among spices, is the most excellent\r\nof all other; for it giueth place neither to that of Cilicia, whereof\r\nSolinus speaketh, neither to anie that commeth from Cilicia, where it\r\ngroweth upon the mount _Taurus, Tmolus, Italie, Ætolia, Sicilia_ or\r\n_Licia_, in sweetnesse, tincture and continuance; so of that which is\r\nto be had amongst us, the same that grows about Saffron Walden, somtime\r\ncalled Waldenburg, in the edge of Essex, first of all planted there\r\nin the time of Edward the Third, and that of Glocestershire and those\r\nwesterlie parts, which some thinke to be better than those of Walden,\r\nsurmounteth all the rest, and therefore beareth worthilie the higher\r\nprice, by sixpence or twelue pence most commonlie in the pound.... The\r\nheads of saffron are raised in Julie, either with plough, raising or\r\ntined hooke; and being scowred from their rosse or filth, and seuered\r\nfrom such heads as are ingendred of them since the last setting, they\r\nare interred againe in Julie and August by ranks or rowes, and being\r\ncouered with moulds, they rest in the earth, where they cast forth\r\nlittle fillets and small roots like vnto a scallion, until September,\r\nin the beginning of which moneth the ground is pared and all weeds and\r\ngrasse that groweth vpon the same remooved, to the intent that nothing\r\nmay annoie the floure when as his time dooth come to rise. These things\r\nbeing thus ordered in the latter end of the aforesaid moneth [of\r\nSeptember], the floure beginneth to appeere of a whitish blew, fesse,\r\nor skie colour, and in the end shewing itselfe in the owne kind, it\r\nresembleth almost the _Leucotion_ of _Theophrast_, sauing that it is\r\nlonger, and hath in the middest thereof three chines verie red and\r\npleasant to behold. These floures are gathered in the morning before\r\nthe rising of the sunne, which otherwise would cause them to welke\r\nor flitter. And the chines being picked from the floures, these are\r\nthrowne into the doong-hill; the other dried vpon little kelles couered\r\nwith streined canuasses vpon a soft fire; wherby and by the weight that\r\nis laied vpon them, they are dried and pressed into cakes, and then\r\nbagged vp for the benefit of their owners. In good yeeres we gather\r\nfoure score or an hundred pounds of wet saffron of an acre, which being\r\ndried dooth yeeld twentie pounds of drie and more. Whereby, and sith\r\nthe price of saffron is commonlie about twentie shillings in monie, or\r\nnot so little, it is easie to see what benefit is reaped by an acre of\r\nthis commoditie.... For admit that the triple tillage of an acre dooth\r\ncost 13 shillings foure pence before the saffron be set, the clodding\r\nsixteene pence, the taking of euerie load of stones from the same foure\r\npence, the raising of euerie quarter of heads six pence, and so much\r\nfor cleansing of them, besides the doong which is woorth six pence the\r\nload to be laid on the first yeere, for the setting three and twentie\r\nshillings and foure pence, for the paring fiue shillings, six pence for\r\nthe picking of a pound wet, etc.; yea though he hire it readie set,\r\nand paie ten pounds for the same, yet shall he susteine no damage, if\r\nwarme weather and open season doo happen at the gathering.\" Harrison\r\nthen describes fully the culture of saffron, and the adulterations and\r\ntricks practised by the dealers, and afterwards describes the virtues\r\nof it: \"Our saffron (beside the manifold vse that it hath in the\r\nkitchin and pastrie, also in our cakes at bridals, and thanksgivings of\r\nwomen) is verie profitably mingled with those medicines which we take\r\nfor the diseases of the breast, of the lungs, of the liuer, and of the\r\nbladder; it is good also for the stomach if you take it in meat, for\r\nit comforteth the same, and maketh good digestion: being sodden also\r\nin wine, it not onelie keepeth a man from dronkennesse, but incorageth\r\nalso unto procreation of issue. If you drinke it in sweet wine, it\r\ninlargeth the breath, and is good for those that are troubled with\r\nthe tisike and shortnesse of the wind: mingled with the milke of a\r\nwoman, and laied vpon the eies, it staieth such humors as descend into\r\nthe same, and taketh away the red wheales and pearles that oft grow\r\nabout them: it killeth moths if it be sowed in paper bags verie thin,\r\nand laid vp in presses among tapistrie or apparrell: also it is verie\r\nprofitable laid vnto all inflammations, painefull aposthumes, and the\r\nshingles, and doth no small ease vnto deafnes.... Three drams thereof\r\ntaken at once, which is about the weight of one shilling nine pence\r\nhalfe penie, is deadlie poison.\"\r\n\r\n[E355] \"The two S. Maries daies,\" _i.e._ July 22nd, St. Mary\r\nMagdalene's Day, and August 15th, the feast of the Assumption of the\r\nVirgin Mary.--M. Mr. Skeat suggests that the days meant are August 15th\r\nand September 8th, the Nativity of the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt Mr. Skeat is right; compare \"Centory must be gotten\r\nbetweene our Lady dayes.\"--Langham's Garden of Health. The date is not\r\nuncommon in Herbals.--Note by Mr. J. Britten, F.L.S.\r\n\r\n[E356] Mustard-seed is very apt to shed, and therefore should be\r\ngathered before it becomes too ripe. After dressing it is to be laid in\r\na soller or garret. \"Soller, a lofte, _garnier_.\"--Palsgrave. \"Garytte,\r\nhay solere.\"--Prompt. Parv.\r\n\r\n[E357] Though all the editions which I have seen read as printed in the\r\ntext, it is evident that Tusser meant exactly the opposite, viz.:\r\n\r\n\"By day will deceiue thee, etc.\r\nBy great will dispatch, etc.\"\r\n\r\nMen who take work by the great, that is, by the job or contract, are,\r\nas experience tells us, naturally anxious to get the work done as soon\r\nas possible, while those who are engaged by the day as naturally try\r\nto spin out the work as long as they can. According to Carr's _Craven\r\nGlossary_, a Day-work is three roods of land. \"Four perches make a\r\nday-worke; ten daysworks make a roode or quarter.\" (Twysden MS. quoted\r\nby Halliwell.) The latter agrees with Norden's statement: \"You must\r\nknow (says he), that there goe 160 perches to one acre; 80 perches to\r\nhalfe an acre; 40 perches to one roode, which is ¼ of an acre; ten\r\n_daies worke_ to a roode, foure perches to a daies worke; 16 foote\r\nand a halfe to a perche.\" (_Surveior's Dialogue_, 1610.) In Cowel's\r\n_Interpreter_ we read \"_Day-werc of Land_, as much arable ground as\r\ncould be ploughed up in one day's work, or one journey, as the farmers\r\nstill call it.\"\r\n\r\n[E358] \"Harvest lord,\" the principal reaper who goes first and\r\nregulates the movements of the rest; _Harvest-Lady_, the second reaper\r\nin the row, called in Cambridgeshire the _Harvest-Queen_. The rate at\r\nwhich the _Harvest-lord_ reaped of course regulated that of the others,\r\nand therefore Tusser recommends that he should have a penny or two\r\nextra in order to encourage him to have an eye to the loiterers, and to\r\nkeep all up to the mark. Cf.:\r\n\r\n\"At heighe pryme Peres lete the plowe stonde,\r\nTo ouersen hem hymself, and who-so best wrouȝte\r\nHe shulde be huyred therafter whan heruest tyme come.\"\r\n  --Piers Plowman, ed. Skeat, E. E. Text Soc. B Text, Passus vi. 114.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars as to the farmer's expenses at harvest\r\ntime are quoted by Mr. Skeat in his notes to Piers Plowman, C. Text,\r\nPassus ix. 104, from Sir J. Cullum's Hist. of Hawsted, Suffolk, 2nd\r\ned.: \"The outgoings [in harvest] were called the costs of autumn,\r\nand are thus stated. In 1388, [we find] the expences of a ploughman,\r\nhead reaper, baker, cook, brewer, _deye_, 244½ reapers (_sic_) hired\r\nfor 1 day; 30 bedrepes (days of work performed in harvest-time by the\r\ncustomary tenants, at the _bidding_ of their lord), the men [being]\r\nfed, according to custom, with bread and herring; 3 qrs. 3 bu. of wheat\r\nfrom the stock; 5 qrs. 3 bu. of malt from the stock; meat bought,\r\n10_s._ 10_d._; 5 sheep from the stock; fish and herrings bought, 5_s._;\r\nherrings bought for the customary tenants, 7_d._; cheese, milk, and\r\nbutter bought (the dairy being let), 9_s._ 6_d._; salt, 3_d._; candles,\r\n5_d._; pepper, 3_d._; spoons, dishes, and faucets, 5_d._ 30 bedrepes,\r\nas before; 19 reapers, hired for 1 day, at their own board, 4_d._ each;\r\n80 men, for 1 day, and kept at the lady's board, 4_d._ each: 40½ men\r\n(_sic_) hired for 1 day, at 3_d._ each; the wages of the head reaper,\r\n6_s._ 8_d._; of the brewer, 3_s._ 4_d._; of the cook, 3_s._ 4_d._ 30\r\nacres of oats tied up by the job (_per taskam_), 1_s._ 8_d._; 6 acres\r\nof bolymong cut and tied up by the job, 3_s._ 4_d._; 16 acres of pease,\r\ncut by the job, 8_s._; 5 acres of pease and bolymong, cut and tied\r\nup by the job, 2_s._ 6_d._; 3 acres of wheat, cut and tied up by the\r\njob, 1_s._ 11_d._\" [Here follow similar details for 1389, including a\r\nmention of 5 pairs of harvest-gloves, 10_d._] \"What a scene of bustling\r\nindustry was this! for, exclusive of the baker, cook, and brewer, who,\r\nwe may presume, were fully engaged in their own offices, here were\r\n553 persons employed in the first year; in the second, 520; and in a\r\nthird, 538; yet the annual number of acres, of all sorts of corn, did\r\nnot much exceed 200. From this prodigious number of hands, the whole\r\nbusiness must have been soon finished. There were probably 2 principal\r\ndays; for two large parties were hired, every year, for 1 day each....\r\nThese ancient harvest-days must have exhibited one of the most cheerful\r\nspectacles in the world. One can hardly imagine a more animated scene\r\nthan that of between 200 and 300 harvest-people all busily employed at\r\nonce, and enlivened with the expectation of a festivity, which perhaps\r\nthey experienced but this one season in the year. All the inhabitants\r\nof the village, of both sexes, and all ages, that could work, must have\r\nbeen assembled on the occasion; a muster that, in the present state of\r\nthings, would be impossible. The success of thus compressing so much\r\nbusiness into so short a time must have depended on the weather. But\r\ndispatch seems to have been the plan of agriculture at this time, at\r\nleast in this village. We have seen before, that 60 persons were hired\r\nfor 1 day, to weed the corn. These throngs of harvest-people were\r\nsuperintended by a person who was called the head-reaper (_supermessor_\r\nor _præpositus_), who was annually elected, and presented to the\r\nlord, by the inhabitants; and it should seem that, in this village at\r\nleast, he was always one of the customary tenants. The year he was in\r\noffice, he was exempt from all or half of his usual rents and services,\r\naccording to his tenure; he was to have his victuals and drink at the\r\nlord's table, if the lord kept house (_si dominus hospitium tenuerit_);\r\nif he did not, he was to have a livery of corn, as other domestics\r\nhad; and his horse was to be kept in the manor-stable. He was next in\r\ndignity to the steward and bailiff. The hay-harvest was an affair of\r\nno great importance. There were but 30 acres of grass annually mown at\r\nthis period. This was done or paid for by the customary tenants. The\r\nprice of mowing an acre was 6_d._\"\r\n\r\nBy an \"Assessment of the Corporation of Canterbury,\" made in 1594, the\r\nfollowing were the rates of wages declared payable:--\"Every labourer\r\nfrom Easter to Michaelmas, with meat and drink, 4_d._ per day; finding\r\nhimself, 10_d._; and from Michaelmas to Easter, with meat and drink,\r\n4_d._; without, 8_d._ Mowers per day, with meat and drink, 8_d._;\r\nfinding themselves, 14_d._ By the acre, with meat and drink, 4_d._;\r\nwithout, 8_d._ Reapers per day, with meat and drink, 6_d._; finding\r\nthemselves, 12_d._; by the acre, with meat and drink, 14_d._; without,\r\n28_d_.

If answered, yes, they assemble in a ring, holding each\r\nother's hands, and inclining their heads to the centre. One of them,\r\ndetached a few yards apart, calls loudly, thrice, 'Holla Lar!--Holla\r\nLar!--Holla Lar!--j e e s.' Those in the ring lengthen out o-o-o-o\r\nwith a low sonorous note and inclined heads, and then throwing the\r\nhead up, vociferate 'a-a-a-ah.' This thrice repeated for a shilling is\r\nthe established exchange in Suffolk.\" \"Largesse bounty, handfuls of\r\nmoney cast among the people.\"--Cotgrave. \"Crye a larges when a rewarde\r\nis geven to workemen, _stipem vociferare_.\"--Huloet's Dict. 1552.

He buys at first hand who pays ready money from\r\nhis own pocket; at second hand who pays ready money, but who, in order\r\nto enable him to do so, has to borrow a portion of the amount, because\r\nhe has not so much money as he requires with him; at third hand who\r\nbuys on credit.\r\n\r\n[E372] \"Stourbridge or Sturbich, the name of a common field extending\r\nbetween Chesterton and Cambridge, near the little brook Sture, for\r\nabout half a mile square, is noted for its fair which is kept annually\r\non September 19th, and continues a fortnight. It is surpassed by few\r\nfairs in Great Britain, or even in Europe, for traffic, though of late\r\nit is much lessened. The booths are placed in rows like streets, by the\r\nname[s] of which they are called, as Cheapside, etc., and are filled\r\nwith all sorts of trades. The Duddery, an area of 80 or 100 yards\r\nsquare, resembles Blackwell Hall. Large commissions are negotiated here\r\nfor all parts of England in cheese, woolen goods, wool, leather, hops,\r\nupholsterers' and ironmongers' ware, etc., etc. Sometimes 50 hackney\r\ncoaches from London, ply morning and night, to and from Cambridge,\r\nas well as all the towns around, and the very barns and stables are\r\nturned into inns for the accommodation of the poorer people. After the\r\nwholesale business is over, the country gentry generally flock in,\r\nlaying out their money in stage-plays, taverns, music-houses, toys,\r\npuppet-shows, etc., and the whole concludes with a day for the sale\r\nof horses. This fair is under the jurisdiction of the University of\r\nCambridge.\"--Walker's Gazetteer, ed. 1801. See also index to Brand's\r\nAntiquities.\r\n\r\nCamden says it was anciently called Steresbrigg, from the little\r\nriver Stere or Sture that runs by it (in his Britannia, under\r\nCambridgeshire). There have been many guesses at the name and origin\r\nof this fair, _e.g._ that of Fuller in his History of the University,\r\np. 66, concerning the clothier of Kendal. The truth of the matter is\r\nthis: King John granted Sturbridge fair for the benefit of the hospital\r\nof lepers which stood there (_v. decretum Hubert. Arch. Cantuar. in\r\nConcil. Londinen. An._ 1200. _Regn. Johann._; Spelman, ii. 127): in\r\nthe certificatorium we are told that the keeper of the hospital holds\r\ntwenty-four and a half acres of land in the county of Cambridgeshire to\r\nmaintain these lepers. The Vice Chancellor has the same power in this\r\nfair that he has in the town of Cambridge. The University is always\r\nto have ground assigned for a booth by the mayor. Midsummer Fair was\r\ngranted to the Prior and Convent of Barnwell, for much the same reason\r\nthat Sturbridge was to the Lepers,--_ad eorum sustentationem_. In the\r\nreign of Henry the Sixth the Nuns of St. Radegund had the grant of\r\nGarlick Fair for the same reason.\r\n\r\n\"Sturbridge Fair was formerly proclaimed by both the Corporation and\r\nthe University authorities. Originally lasting six weeks, in 1785 it\r\nlasted only three weeks, and now it lasts but one week. A very amusing\r\naccount of its proclamation by the Vice Chancellor will be found in\r\nGunning's 'Reminiscences of Cambridge.'\"--S.

R. 3, 14, in Trinity Coll. Camb.) is written,\r\n\r\n\"God spede the plouȝ\r\n& sende vs korne I-now.\"\r\n\r\nSee print in beginning of Wright's ed. of Piers Plowman.\r\n\r\n[E377] The advice given in this short piece, the most difficult,\r\nperhaps, that Tusser had written, is very good, but he has strained\r\nalliteration to an extravagant pitch.\r\n\r\n[E378] In the reign of Elizabeth an Act was passed, requiring a seven\r\nyears' apprenticeship to enable a person to set up in business or\r\ntrade; and hence the idea arose of dividing human life into periods of\r\nseven years.--M. The idea is much older; for, in Arnold's Chronicle\r\n(edition 1811), page 157, we find:--\"The vij Ages of Mā liuing ī the\r\nWorld. The furst age is infance and lastith from ye byrth vnto vij yere\r\nof age. The ij is childhod and endurith vnto xv yere age. The iij age\r\nis adholocencye and endurith vnto xxv yere age. The iiij age is youth\r\nand endurith vnto xxxv yere age. The v age is manhod and endurith vnto\r\nl yere age. The vj age is [elde] and lasteth vnto lxx yere age.

Compare Wycliffe's\r\ntranslation of Luke xiii. 8, as given at p. 365 of Dr. Bosworth's edit.\r\nof the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon Gospels, with the Versions of Wycliffe\r\nand Tyndale, London, 1865.\r\n\r\n[E385] \"Experience should seeme to proue playnely, that Inclosures\r\nshould be profitable and not hurtfull to the common weale; for we see\r\nthe countryes where most Inclosiers be, are most wealthy, as _Essex,\r\nKent, Northamptonshyre,_ etc. And I have hearde a Ciuilian once say,\r\nthat it was taken for a Maxime in his lawe (this saying), 'that which\r\nis possessed of many in common, is neglected of all;' and experience\r\nsheweth that Tenaunts in common be not so good husbandes, as when euery\r\nman hath his parte in seueralty; also, I have heard say, that in the\r\nmost countreyes beyonde the Sea, they knowe not what a common grounde\r\nmeaneth.\"--Stafford's Examination of Complaints, New Shakspere Soc.,\r\ned.

E. Text Soc., ed. Furnivall, p. 82), speaks of\r\n\"lewtering lusks and lazy _lorrels_,\" and in Pierce Plowman's Crede\r\nwe find in line 750, \"lordes sones lowly to þo _losells_ aloute,\" and\r\nin l. 755, \"and leueþ swiche _lorels_ for her lowe wordes.\"--See Note\r\nin Prompt. Parv. _s.v._ Lorel. Levins (Manip. Vocab. 1570) translates\r\n_lorel_ by _nebulo, scurra_.\r\n\r\n[E388] Courts for presenting nuisances are generally the greatest\r\nnuisances themselves. Under the semblance of justice, they often retard\r\nits execution. The members, or jury who compose them, do not want the\r\npower, but they want the independence to act right.--M.\r\n\r\n[E389] \"In Bridewell a number be stript,\" etc. Although all the\r\neditions I have been able to examine read \"lesse worthie than _theefe_\r\nto be whipt,\" I suspect the correct reading to be \"lesse worthie than\r\n_theese_ to be whipt.\" The mistake might easily occur through the\r\nsimilarity of the old _s_ and _f_. The meaning, as the lines read at\r\npresent, is not very clear, but if we adopt the suggested reading, the\r\nsense becomes at once apparent:--\"In Bridewell many are stripped for\r\nflogging who do not deserve it so much as these.\"\r\n\r\n[E390] \"Take them\" = arrest them.\r\n\r\n[E391] \"Mo,\" lit. = more; but also used in the sense of others. \"This\r\nuse of _mo_ is not common, but there are a few examples of it. Thus in\r\nSpecimens of English, ed. Morris and Skeat, we have at p. 47, l. 51,\r\n\r\n\"'Y sike for vnsete\r\nAnt mourne ase men doþ _mo_.'\r\n\r\n\"_i.e._ 'I sigh for unrest, and mourn as _other_ men do.' And on the\r\nnext page (48, l. 22) we have\r\n\r\n\"'Mody meneþ so doþ _mo_,\r\nIchot ycham on of þo,'\r\n\r\n\"_i.e._ 'The moody moan as _others_ do; I wot I am one of them.'\r\nSomewhat similar is the expression _oþer mo_, where we should now say\r\n_others as well_, Piers Plowman, C. Text, Passus v. 10.\"--Rev. W.\r\nSkeat, in note to l. 1039 of Chaucer, Clerke's Tale, Clarendon Press\r\nSeries. _Mo_ is also used in the same sense in 67, 11, p. 154.\r\n\r\n[E392] \"Verlets,\" originally a servant to a knight, below page or\r\nsquire, though often used in French Romance as equivalent to a squire.\r\n\"Pages, _varlets_, ou damoiseaux: noms quelquefois communs aux\r\n_ecuyers_.\"--Cotgrave. Ducange (Gloss. M. et I. Lat.) has: \"_Valeti\r\nvalecti_ appellati vulgo magnatum filii, qui necdum militare cingulum\r\nconsecuti erant: vassallorum filii _vassaleti_ dicti.\" Levins (Manip.\r\nVocab.) says: \"Varlett, _verna_.\" See Wedgwood, Dict. Eng. Etymology,\r\n_s.v._ Valet.\r\n\r\n[E393] \"Ruleth the roste;\" to _rule_ the _roast_ is to preside at the\r\nboard, to assign what share one pleases to the guests; hence it came\r\nto mean to domineer, in which sense it is commonly used in our old\r\nauthors. See Nares, s.v.\r\n\r\n[E394] With this description of an envious neighbour compare Langland's\r\npicture of _Invidia_ (Envy) in Piers Plowman, B. Text, E. E. Text Soc.,\r\ned. Skeat, Passus v. l. 76.\r\n\r\n[E395] \"His hatred procureth,\" etc., his hatred takes pains to bring\r\nbad to worse, his friendship is like that of Judas who, etc., _i.e._ is\r\nselfish.\r\n\r\n[E396] \"His lips out of frame,\" _i.e._ are out of order, are not kept\r\nin order. Cf. the expression \"loose in the haft.\"\r\n\r\n[E397] \"Spials;\" so Spenser, Faery Queene, i. 4:\r\n\r\n\"And privie spials plast in all his way,\"\r\n\r\nLevins (Manip.

He spared in his revilings neither prince nor chief, but directed\r\nhis abuse especially against Achilles and Ulysses. The name is often\r\nused to denote a calumniator. Cf.\r\n\r\n\"When rank Thersites opes his mastiff jaws,\r\nWe shall hear music, wit, and oracle.\"\r\n  --Shakspere, Troilus and Cressida, Act i. sc. 3.\r\n\r\n[E402] \"Shall swell like a tode.\" Cf. 65, 6.\r\n\r\n[E403] \"To hold a candle to the devil is to assist in a bad cause or an\r\nevil matter.\"--Ray. Hazlitt (English Proverbs, p. 407) gives \"'Tis good\r\nsometimes to hold a candle to the devil.\" Thus we find an anonymous\r\ncorrespondent writing to John Paston: \"for howr Lords love, goo tharow\r\nwith Wyll Weseter, and also plese Chrewys as ye thynke in yow hert\r\nbest for to do; for it is a comon proverbe, 'A man must sumtyme _set a\r\ncandel befor the Devyle_;' and therfor thow it be not alder most mede\r\nand profytabyl, yet of ij harmys the leste is to be take.\"--Paston\r\nLetters, ed.

To _fetch the wind_, to _take the wind_ (Bacon), and to _have\r\nthe wind_ are various forms of the same expression, the meaning of\r\nwhich is to gain or take an advantage. We still use the expression \"to\r\nget to windward of another,\" meaning to get the better or advantage of\r\nhim. Mavor reads, \"false _words_ can fetch the wind,\" _i.e._ slander\r\nwill spread as though borne on the wind. I do not, however, know on\r\nwhat authority he has adopted this reading, as the text of 1577 gives\r\n\"birds.\"\r\n\r\n[E406] The following poem on Evil Tongues is from a MS. of the 15th\r\ncentury, edited for the Percy Soc. by the late Mr. T. Wright, 1847:\r\n\r\n        \"A man that con his tong stere,\r\n        He ther not rek wer that he go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ittes knowyn in every schyre,\r\nWekyd tongges have no pere;\r\nI wold thei wer brent in the fer,\r\n        That warke men soo mykyll wo.\r\n\r\nIttes knowyn in every lond,\r\nWekyd tongges don gret wrong,\r\nThei make me to lyyn long,\r\n        And also in myche car.\r\n\r\nȜyf a man go in clothes gay,\r\nOr elles in gud aray,\r\nWekyd tongges yet wyl say,\r\n        Wer cam the by therto?\r\n\r\nȜyf a man go in cloys ill,\r\nAnd have not the world at wyl,\r\nWekyd tongges thei wyll hym spyll,\r\n        And seyd he ys a stake, lat hym goo.\r\n\r\nNow us to amend God yeve us grace,\r\nOf repentens and of gud grace,\r\nThat we mut se hys glorius face.\r\n        Amen, Amen, for charyte.\"\r\n\r\n[E407] There is a smoothness in the versification of this sonnet,\r\nand a succession of imagery, though drawn from common sources, which\r\nwe do not often find in Tusser. He has made a good use of the figure\r\n_erotesis_.--M. Compare Milton, Lycidas, 45:\r\n\r\n\"As killing as the canker to the rose,\r\nOr _taint-worm_ to the weanling herds that graze.\"\r\n\r\n[E408] Janus, an old Italian deity, the god of the sun and the year, to\r\nwhom the month of January was dedicated.\r\n\r\n[E409] Ver = Spring, Æstas = Summer, Hyems = Winter.\r\n\r\n[E410] \"Delaide;\" so in Spenser, Faery Queene, ix. 30. \"But to _delay_\r\nthe heat,\" and in Prothalamium 3:\r\n\r\n         \"Zephyrus did softly play\r\nA gentle spirit, that lightly did _delay_\r\nHot Titan's beames.\"\r\n\r\n[E411] Alluding to the thirteen revolutions of the moon in the year.\r\n\r\n[E412] It appears from the Books of the Stationers' Company, on the\r\nauthority of Warton (Hist. of Eng. Poetry, vol. iii. p. 428) that\r\na licence was granted to T. Hackett, in the year 1562, to print \"A\r\nDialogue of Wyvynge and Thryvynge of Tusshers with ij lessons for olde\r\nand yonge.\"\r\n\r\n[E413] \"Bolted out,\" a term taken from the language and usage of\r\nmillers, who use the word \"to bolt\" of the separation of the bran from\r\nthe flour.

D. Soc. 1877), we have:\r\n\"The _Black Bull's_ trodden on him;\" that is, he is in a very bad\r\ntemper. And the following passage from Bernard's Terence is quoted:\r\n\"Prosperitie hangs on his sleeue; the _black oxe_ cannot tread on his\r\nfoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Venus waxeth old; and then she was a pretie wench, when Juno was a\r\nyoung wife; now crowes foote is on her eye, and the _black oxe_ hath\r\ntrod on her foot.\"--Lyly's Sapho and Phao, 1584, ed. 1858, i. 199.\r\n\r\nMr. George Vere Irving (Notes and Queries, 3rd Ser. xii. 488) remarks\r\nthat this expression is at this day frequently used in Scotland in\r\nreference to a person who has experienced misfortune. See Hazlitt's\r\nEng. Proverbs, p. 359.\r\n\r\n[E418] \"It is too much we dailie heare,\" etc. This proverbial\r\nexpression occurs in the _Townley Mysteries_, p. 86, as--\r\n\r\n\"A man may not wive,\r\nAnd also thrive,\r\n  And all in one year.\"\r\n\r\n[E419] \"As _mo_ have bin;\" compare note E391.\r\n\r\n[E420] \"The good wiues husband weares no breech.\" So in a song in the\r\nMS. of the 15th cent. quoted above, the heading of which is\r\n\r\n    \"_Nova, Nova,_ sawe yow ever such,\r\nThe moste mayster of the hows weryth no brych.\"\r\n\r\nThe burden of the song being\r\n\r\n\"Lest the most mayster wer no brych.\"\r\n\r\n[E421] The same reply is attributed to Thales.

Newton, and lady of Thomas, Lord Paget.\r\n\r\n[E425] \"By their fruits ye shall know them, do men gather grapes of\r\nthorns or figs of thistles?\"\r\n\r\n[E426] The rime in the last two lines is most remarkable; apparently\r\n_thriue_ is pronounced _threev_, as Mr. Ellis contends.\r\n\r\n[E427] From the last two lines of this stanza it would appear that\r\nTusser was a widower at the time when he wrote this Address to the\r\nReader, or at least when he first wrote on the subject of Huswifery.\r\n\r\n[E428] \"A description of Huswife,\" etc. This antithetical description\r\nseems to have been introduced, in order that it might correspond with\r\nthe description of Husbandry, chapter 8, p. 16.--M.\r\n\r\n[E429] According to Fitzherbert, the farmers' wives must have been\r\npatterns of diligence and industry, and a variety of duties devolved\r\nupon them which have since ceased to be required, or have fallen\r\nwith more propriety upon the other sex. They had to measure out\r\nthe quantity of corn to be ground, and see that it was sent to the\r\nmiller. The poultry, swine, and cows were under their charge; and they\r\nsuperintended the brewing and baking. The garden was peculiarly the\r\ncare of the farmer's wife. She had to depend upon it for various herbs\r\nwhich are no longer in use, but which could not be dispensed with when\r\nspices were rare and costly. Besides pot-herbs, strewing-herbs were\r\nrequired for the chambers, and herbs possessing medical virtues. The\r\nlist of fruits at this date was confined to a few of indigenous growth,\r\nwhich were but little improved by skill and management. Tusser directs\r\nhis housewife to transplant into her garden wild strawberries from the\r\nwoods. All the writers on rural economy during this period recommend\r\nthe farmer's wife carefully to attend to her crop of flax and hemp.\r\nWhen, however, Fitzherbert asserts that it is a wife's duty \"to winnow\r\nall manner of corn, to make malt, to wash, and to make hay, shear\r\ncorn, and, in time of need, help her husband to fill the muck-wain or\r\ndung-cart, drive the plough, to load hay, corn, and such other, to go\r\nto market and sell butter or pigs, fowls or corn,\" it is to be presumed\r\nthat he had in his view the smallest class of yeomen, who had no hired\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n[E430] \"Reason their cace,\" that is, gossip and argue over their\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n[E431] \"Home is home, be it never so ill.\" Ballad licensed in 1569-70.\r\nClarke (Paræm. 1639, p. 101) has with us, \"home is home, be it never so\r\nhomely.\" On the other hand, Heywood, in his Epigrams, 1562, says:\r\n\r\n\"Home is homely, yea, and to homely sometyme,\r\nWhere wives' footestooles to their husbandes' heads clime.\"\r\n\r\n[E432] \"Familie\" = household. Compare chap. 9, st. 12.\r\n\r\n[E433] \"Maides, three a clock,\" etc. Compare Romeo and Juliet, Act iv.\r\nsc. 4, 3--\r\n\r\n                     \"The second cock hath crow'd,\r\nThe curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n[E434] \"Lay your bucks,\" _i.e._ get ready the washing tubs.\r\nCompare: \"Throw foul linen upon him as if it were going to\r\n_bucking_.\"--Shakspere, Merry Wives of Wind., Act iii. sc. 3.\r\nBuck-basket, the basket in which linen is carried to the wash.\r\n\"Bouck-fatt, a washing tub.\"--Upton Inventories, p. 28.

Blunt, p. 15, we read: \"At houre of tyerse [9 a.m.]\r\nlabourers desyre to haue theyr dyner.\"\r\n\r\nIn Chambers's Book of Days, i. 96, we read that Gervase Markham, in\r\n1653, makes the ploughman have three meals, viz. breakfast at 6 a.m.,\r\ndinner at half-past 3 p.m., and supper at 6 p.m. See also note E444.\r\n\r\n[E436] In the Library of Caius Coll. Camb. is a volume of Tracts, No.\r\n286, one of which, published in 1555, An Account of the Cruelties of\r\nthe King of Spain, has as its motto: \"Beware of Had I wiste.\" This is\r\nalso the title of a poem in the Paradyce of Daynty Deuyses, 1578. It is\r\nquoted by Sir Simon D'Ewes (Diary, etc., ii. 366):\r\n\r\n\"Telle neuere the more thoug thou myche heere,\r\nAnd euere be waare of _had-y-wist_.\"\r\n  --Babees Book, ed. Furnivall, p. 264, l. 72.\r\n\r\n[E437] See note E52.\r\n\r\n[E438]\r\n\r\n\"Beware that ye geue no persone palled drynke, for feere\r\nHit mygtt brynge many a man in disese durynge many a yere.\"\r\n  --John Russell's Boke of Norture, in Babees Book, p. 13.\r\n\r\n\"Sowre ale, and dead ale, and ale the whiche doth stande a tylte is\r\ngood for no man.\"--Andrew Boorde, Regimen of Health.\r\n\r\n\"Of ale and beer, as well as of wine, we find various kinds mentioned.\r\nThere were single beer, or small ale, which could do little more than\r\nquench thirst,--and double beer, which was recommended as containing a\r\ndouble quantity of malt and hops,--and double-double beer, which was\r\ntwice as strong as that,--and dagger-ale, which, as the name implies,\r\nwas reckoned particularly sharp and dangerous,--and bracket, a kind\r\nof ale which we are unable distinctly to describe. But the favourite\r\ndrink, as well as the chief article of vulgar debauch, was a kind of\r\nale commonly called huffcap, but which was also termed 'mad dog,'\r\n'angel's food,' 'dragon's milk,' and other such ridiculous names, by\r\nthe frequenters of ale-houses: 'and never,' says Harrison, 'did Romulus\r\nand Remus suck their she-wolf with such eager and sharp devotion as\r\nthese men hale at huffcap, till they be as red as cocks, and little\r\nwiser than their combs.' The higher classes, who were able to afford\r\nsuch a luxury, brewed a generous liquor for their own consumption,\r\nwhich they did not bring to the table till it was two years old. This\r\nwas called March ale, from the month in which it was brewed. But the\r\nservants had to content themselves with a more simple beverage that\r\nwas seldom more than a month old. A cup of choice ale was often as\r\nrichly compounded with dainties as the finest wines. Sometimes it was\r\nwarmed, and qualified with sugar and spices; sometimes with a toast;\r\noften with a roasted crab or apple, making the beverage still known\r\nunder the name of Lambs'-wool; while to stir the whole composition with\r\na sprig of rosemary, was supposed to give it an additional flavour.\r\nThe drinks made from fruit were chiefly cider, perry, and mum. Those\r\nthat had formerly been made from honey seem to have fallen into disuse\r\nin consequence of the general taste for stronger potations; metheglin\r\nbeing now chiefly confined to the Welsh. A simple liquor, however,\r\nwas still used in Essex, called by Harrison, somewhat contemptuously,\r\n'a swish-swash,' made of water with a little honey and spice, but\r\n'as differing,' he says, 'from true metheglin as chalk doth from\r\ncheese.' He informs us, moreover, that already the tapsters of\r\nEngland had learned to adulterate their ale and beer with pernicious\r\ncompounds.\"--Pict. Hist. of England, ii. 883.\r\n\r\n\"In the parish of Hawsted, Suffolk, the allowance of food to the\r\nlabourer in harvest was, two herrings per day, milk from the manor\r\ndairy to make cheese, and a loaf of bread, of which fifteen were made\r\nfrom a bushel of wheat. Messes of potage made their frequent appearance\r\nat the rustic board.\"--Knight, Pict. Hist. of England, i. 839.\r\n\r\n[E439] Harrison gives an account (pp. 153-4) of the following kinds of\r\nbread made in England: 1. Mainchet, \"commonlie called white bread, in\r\nLatine _Primarius panis_.\" 2. Cheat \"or wheaton bread, so named bicause\r\nthe colour therof resembleth the graie [or yellowish] wheat [being\r\ncleane and well dressed,] and out of this is the coursest of the bran\r\n(vsuallie called gurgeons or pollard) taken. The raueled is a kind of\r\ncheat bread also, but it reteineth more of the grosse, and lesse of\r\nthe pure substance of the wheat.\" 3. Brown bread, of which there were\r\ntwo kinds, viz. (_a_) of whole meal unsifted, (_b_) pollard bread,\r\nwith a little rye meal, and called Miscelin or Meslin. \"In champeigne\r\ncountries much rie and barleie bread is eaten, but especiallie where\r\nwheat is scant and geson.\"\r\n\r\n[E440] \"Baies.\" Halliwell prints this word as _baics_ in his\r\nDictionary, defining it as \"chidings, reproofs,\" and giving as his\r\nauthority Hunter's Additions to Boucher.\r\n\r\n[E441] \"Droie.\" See Note in Prompt.

This was the holiday of the ploughmen, who used to go\r\nabout from house to house begging for plough-money to drink. In the\r\nnorthern counties, where this practice was called the fool-plough (a\r\ncorruption perhaps of _yule_-plough), a number of sword-dancers dragged\r\nabout a plough, while one of the party, called the Bessey, was dressed\r\nfor the occasion like an old woman; and another, who was the fool of\r\nthe pageant, was almost covered with skins, and wore the tail of some\r\nanimal dangling down his back. While the rest danced, one of these odd\r\npersonages went among the spectators, rattling a box, and collecting\r\nsmall donations; and it is said that whosoever refused to pay had the\r\nplough dragged to his door and the soil of his threshold ploughed\r\nup.\"--Pict.

The meaning of the two lines:\r\n\r\n\"If ploughman get hatchet or whip to the skreene,\r\nmaides loseth their cock if no water be seene,\"\r\n\r\nis, \"if the ploughman can get his whip, ploughstaff, hatchet, or\r\nanything he wants in the field to the fireside (_screen_ being here\r\nequivalent to _fireside_) before the maid has got her kettle on, then\r\nshe loses her Shrove-tide cock, which belongs wholly to the men.\"\r\n\r\n[E454] \"Shroftide.\" The Hen is hung at a Fellow's back who has also\r\nsome Horse Bells about him, the rest of the Fellows are blinded, and\r\nhave Boughs in their Hands, with which they chase this Fellow and his\r\nHen about some large Court or small Enclosure.

It\r\nhad been the custom, on the dedication of a church, or the birth-day\r\nof a saint, for the people to assemble on the night previous, to hold\r\na religious vigil in the open air; and, as they remained all night\r\noccupied in devotional exercises, this practice was called a wake.\r\nSuch a method of spending the night, however, soon gave place to very\r\ndifferent employments; and feasting, riot, and licentiousness became\r\nthe prevailing characteristics of these vigils. These concourses,\r\nalso, from every neighbouring town and parish, naturally suggested the\r\nexpediency of improving such opportunities for the purposes of traffic;\r\nand hence the wakes gradually became fairs, which in some places they\r\nstill continue to be.\"--Pict.

Soc. \"Rennish,\"\r\nin the sense of \"furious, passionate,\" which is in Ray's collection of\r\nNorth-country words, is, perhaps, another form of the word.\r\n\r\n[E478] \"Still presently,\" _i.e._ always as close at hand.\r\n\r\n[E479] \"In vsing there his will,\" that is, in doing so he acted of his\r\nown free will.\r\n\r\n[E480] \"Seene\" = appeared, showed himself.\r\n\r\n[E481] \"Do show\" (to who thou wouldst to know). The meaning is\r\nperfectly clear, but the manner in which it is expressed is very\r\ncurious. We may paraphrase it thus: \"doth show to him whom thou wishest\r\nto teach.\"\r\n\r\n[E482] Compare Psalm ciii. 15, 6.\r\n\r\n[E483] \"Let gift no glorie looke,\" that is, in giving alms look for\r\n(expect) no praise or earthly reward for so doing.\r\n\r\n[E484] \"Provoke\" = urge.\r\n\r\n[E485] In the edition of 1577 the arrangement of this chapter is\r\nsomewhat different. The Latin verses are first printed by themselves,\r\nand headed \"Sancti Barnardi dicta,\" and after comes the English\r\nversion, with the following title: \"Eight of Saint Barnardes verses,\r\ntranslated out of Latin | into english by this Aucthor for one kind |\r\nof note to serue both ditties.\" The translation in the \"Paradise of\r\nDainty Devices,\" mentioned by Mason, is by Barnaby Rich, under the\r\nsignature of \"My Luck is Loss.\" The following is the first verse,\r\ntranscribed for comparison with Tusser's version:\r\n\r\n\"Why doth each state apply itself to worldly praise?\r\nAnd undertake such toil, to heap up honour's gain,\r\nWhose seat, though seeming sure, on fickle fortune stays,\r\nWhose gifts are never prov'd perpetual to remain?\r\nBut even as earthen pots, with every fillip fails:\r\nSo fortune's favour flits, and fame with honour quails.\"\r\n\r\n[E486] \"Carle.\" M.

They allude to recent events,\r\nto \"fatal chance,\" and to other circumstances, which would have been\r\nobliterated from the mind after the lapse of so many years.--M.

And now so it\r\nis, that in the said city and counties, there be fourscore attornies\r\nor more, the more part of them having no other thing to live upon but\r\nonly his gain by the practice of attorneyship, and also the more part\r\nof them not being of sufficient knowledge to be an attorney, which\r\ncome to every fair, market, and other places, where is any assembly\r\nof people, exhorting, procuring, moving and inciting the people to\r\nattempt untrue foreign suits for small trespasses, little offences\r\nand small sums of debt, whose actions be triable and determinable in\r\nCourt Barons; whereby proceed many suits, more of evil will and malice\r\nthan of the truth of the thing, to the manifold vexation and no little\r\ndamage of the inhabitants of the said city and counties, and also to\r\nthe perpetual destruction of all the Courts Baron in the said counties,\r\nunless convenient remedy be provided in this behalf; the foresaid Lord\r\nthe King considering the premises, by the advice, assent and authority\r\naforesaid, hath ordained and established, that at all times from\r\nhenceforth there shall be but six common attornies in the said County\r\nof Norfolk, and six common attornies in the said County of Suffolk, and\r\ntwo common attornies in the said City of Norwich, to be attornies in\r\nthe Courts of Record; and that all the said fourteen attornies shall be\r\nelected and admitted by the two Chief Justices of our Lord the King for\r\nthe time being, of the most sufficient and best instructed, by their\r\ndiscretions.\" East Anglians were frequently called \"Barrators,\" that\r\nis, incitors to lawsuits (O.
