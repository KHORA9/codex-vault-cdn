LIMITED\r\n  38 GREAT RUSSELL STREET\r\n  1910\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to give an account of the science of\r\nAstronomy, as it is known at the present day, in a manner acceptable to\r\nthe _general reader_.\r\n\r\nIt is too often supposed that it is impossible to acquire any useful\r\nknowledge of Astronomy without much laborious study, and without\r\nadventuring into quite a new world of thought. The reasoning applied to\r\nthe study of the celestial orbs is, however, of no different order from\r\nthat which is employed in the affairs of everyday life. The science of\r\nmathematics is perhaps responsible for the idea that some kind of\r\ndifference does exist; but mathematical processes are, in effect, no\r\nmore than ordinary logic in concentrated form, the _shorthand of\r\nreasoning_, so to speak. I have attempted in the following pages to take\r\nthe main facts and theories of Astronomy out of those mathematical forms\r\nwhich repel the general reader, and to present them in the _ordinary\r\nlanguage of our workaday world_.\r\n\r\nThe few diagrams introduced are altogether supplementary, and are not\r\nconnected with the text by any wearying cross-references. Each diagram\r\nis complete in itself, being intended to serve as a pictorial aid, in\r\ncase the wording of the text should not have perfectly conveyed the\r\ndesired meaning. The full page illustrations are also described as\r\nadequately as possible at the foot of each.\r\n\r\nAs to the coloured frontispiece, this must be placed in a category by\r\nitself. It is the work of the _artist_ as distinct from the scientist.\r\n\r\nThe book itself contains incidentally a good deal of matter concerned\r\nwith the Astronomy of the past, the introduction of which has been found\r\nnecessary in order to make clearer the Astronomy of our time.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite impossible for me to enumerate here the many sources\r\nfrom which information has been drawn. But I acknowledge my especial\r\nindebtedness to Professor F.R. Moulton's _Introduction to Astronomy_\r\n(Macmillan, 1906), to the works on Eclipses of the late Rev. S.J.\r\nJohnson and of Mr. W.T. Lynn, and to the excellent _Journals of the\r\nBritish Astronomical Association_. Further, for those grand questions\r\nconcerned with the Stellar Universe at large, I owe a very deep debt to\r\nthe writings of the famous American astronomer, Professor Simon Newcomb,\r\nand of our own countryman, Mr. John Ellard Gore; to the latter of whom I\r\nam under an additional obligation for much valuable information\r\nprivately rendered.\r\n\r\nIn my search for suitable illustrations, I have been greatly aided by\r\nthe kindly advice of Mr. W. H. Wesley, the Assistant Secretary of the\r\nRoyal Astronomical Society. To those who have been so good as to permit\r\nme to reproduce pictures and photographs, I desire to record my best\r\nthanks as follows:--To the French Artist, Mdlle. Andrée Moch; to the\r\nAstronomer Royal; to Sir David Gill, K.C.B., LL.D., F.R.S.; to the\r\nCouncil of the Royal Astronomical Society; to Professor E.B. Frost,\r\nDirector of the Yerkes Observatory; to M.P. Puiseux, of the Paris\r\nObservatory; to Dr. Max Wolf, of Heidelberg; to Professor Percival\r\nLowell; to the Rev. Theodore E.R. Phillips, M.A., F.R.A.S.; to Mr. W.H.\r\nWesley; to the Warner and Swasey Co., of Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.; to the\r\npublishers of _Knowledge_, and to Messrs. Sampson, Low & Co. For\r\npermission to reproduce the beautiful photograph of the Spiral Nebula in\r\nCanes Venatici (Plate XXII.), I am indebted to the distinguished\r\nastronomer, the late Dr. W.E. Wilson, D.Sc., F.R.S., whose untimely\r\ndeath, I regret to state, occurred in the early part of this year.\r\n\r\nFinally, my best thanks are due to Mr. John Ellard Gore, F.R.A.S.,\r\nM.R.I.A., to Mr. W.H. Wesley, and to Mr. John Butler Burke, M.A., of\r\nCambridge, for their kindness in reading the proof-sheets.\r\n\r\nCECIL G.

Such must\r\nneeds have been the idea of the universe held by men in the earliest\r\ntimes. In their view the earth was of paramount importance. The sun and\r\nmoon were mere lamps for the day and for the night; and these, if not\r\ngods themselves, were at any rate under the charge of special deities,\r\nwhose task it was to guide their motions across the vaulted sky.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, however, this simple estimate of nature began to be\r\noverturned. Difficult problems agitated the human mind. On what, for\r\ninstance, did the solid earth rest, and what prevented the vaulted\r\nheaven from falling in upon men and crushing them out of existence?\r\nFantastic myths sprang from the vain attempts to solve these riddles.\r\nThe Hindoos, for example, imagined the earth as supported by four\r\nelephants which stood upon the back of a gigantic tortoise, which, in\r\nits turn, floated on the surface of an elemental ocean. The early\r\nWestern civilisations conceived the fable of the Titan Atlas, who, as a\r\npunishment for revolt against the Olympian gods, was condemned to hold\r\nup the expanse of sky for ever and ever.\r\n\r\nLater on glimmerings of the true light began to break in upon men. The\r\nGreek philosophers, who busied themselves much with such matters,\r\ngradually became convinced that the earth was spherical in shape, that\r\nis to say, round like a ball. In this opinion we now know that they were\r\nright; but in their other important belief, viz. that the earth was\r\nplaced at the centre of all things, they were indeed very far from the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nBy the second century of the Christian era, the ideas of the early\r\nphilosophers had become hardened into a definite theory, which, though\r\nit appears very incorrect to us to-day, nevertheless demands exceptional\r\nnotice from the fact that it was everywhere accepted as the true\r\nexplanation until so late as some four centuries ago. This theory of the\r\nuniverse is known by the name of the Ptolemaic System, because it was\r\nfirst set forth in definite terms by one of the most famous of the\r\nastronomers of antiquity, Claudius Ptolemæus Pelusinensis (100-170\r\nA.D.), better known as Ptolemy of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nIn his system the Earth occupied the centre; while around it circled in\r\norder outwards the Moon, the planets Mercury and Venus, the Sun, and\r\nthen the planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Beyond these again revolved\r\nthe background of the heaven, upon which it was believed that the stars\r\nwere fixed--\r\n\r\n     \"Stellis ardentibus aptum,\"\r\n\r\nas Virgil puts it (see Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The Ptolemaic idea of the Universe.]\r\n\r\nThe Ptolemaic system persisted unshaken for about fourteen hundred years\r\nafter the death of its author. Clearly men were flattered by the notion\r\nthat their earth was the most important body in nature, that it stood\r\nstill at the centre of the universe, and was the pivot upon which all\r\nthings revolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN VIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is still well under four hundred years since the modern, or\r\nCopernican, theory of the universe supplanted the Ptolemaic, which had\r\nheld sway during so many centuries. In this new theory, propounded\r\ntowards the middle of the sixteenth century by Nicholas Copernicus\r\n(1473-1543), a Prussian astronomer, the earth was dethroned from its\r\ncentral position and considered merely as one of a number of planetary\r\nbodies which revolve around the sun. As it is not a part of our purpose\r\nto follow in detail the history of the science, it seems advisable to\r\nbegin by stating in a broad fashion the conception of the universe as\r\naccepted and believed in to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, the most important of the celestial bodies so far as we are\r\nconcerned, occupies the central position; not, however, in the whole\r\nuniverse, but only in that limited portion which is known as the Solar\r\nSystem. Around it, in the following order outwards, circle the planets\r\nMercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune\r\n(see Fig. 2, p. 21). At an immense distance beyond the solar system, and\r\nscattered irregularly through the depth of space, lie the stars. The two\r\nfirst-mentioned members of the solar system, Mercury and Venus, are\r\nknown as the Inferior Planets; and in their courses about the sun, they\r\nalways keep well inside the path along which our earth moves. The\r\nremaining members (exclusive of the earth) are called Superior Planets,\r\nand their paths lie all outside that of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The Copernican theory of the Solar System.]\r\n\r\nThe five planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have been\r\nknown from all antiquity. Nothing then can bring home to us more\r\nstrongly the immense advance which has taken place in astronomy during\r\nmodern times than the fact that it is only 127 years since observation\r\nof the skies first added a planet to that time-honoured number. It was\r\nindeed on the 13th of March 1781, while engaged in observing the\r\nconstellation of the Twins, that the justly famous Sir William Herschel\r\ncaught sight of an object which he did not recognise as having met with\r\nbefore. He at first took it for a comet, but observations of its\r\nmovements during a few days showed it to be a planet. This body, which\r\nthe power of the telescope alone had thus shown to belong to the solar\r\nfamily, has since become known to science under the name of Uranus. By\r\nits discovery the hitherto accepted limits of the solar system were at\r\nonce pushed out to twice their former extent, and the hope naturally\r\narose that other planets would quickly reveal themselves in the\r\nimmensities beyond.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years prior to Herschel's great discovery, it had been\r\nnoticed that the distances at which the then known planets circulated\r\nappeared to be arranged in a somewhat orderly progression outwards from\r\nthe sun. This seeming plan, known to astronomers by the name of Bode's\r\nLaw, was closely confirmed by the distance of the new planet Uranus.\r\nThere still lay, however, a broad gap between the planets Mars and\r\nJupiter. Had another planet indeed circuited there, the solar system\r\nwould have presented an appearance of almost perfect order. But the void\r\nbetween Mars and Jupiter was unfilled; the space in which one would\r\nreasonably expect to find another planet circling was unaccountably\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the nineteenth century the mystery was however\r\nexplained, a body being discovered[1] which revolved in the space that\r\nhad hitherto been considered planetless. But it was a tiny globe hardly\r\nworthy of the name of planet. In the following year a second body was\r\ndiscovered revolving in the same space; but it was even smaller in size\r\nthan the first. During the ensuing five years two more of these little\r\nplanets were discovered. Then came a pause, no more such bodies being\r\nadded to the system until half-way through the century, when suddenly\r\nthe discovery of these so-called \"minor planets\" began anew. Since then\r\nadditions to this portion of our system have rained thick and fast. The\r\nsmall bodies have received the name of Asteroids or Planetoids; and up\r\nto the present time some six hundred of them are known to exist, all\r\nrevolving in the previously unfilled space between Mars and Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1846 the outer boundary of the solar system was again\r\nextended by the discovery that a great planet circulated beyond Uranus.\r\nThe new body, which received the name of Neptune, was brought to light\r\nas the result of calculations made at the same time, though quite\r\nindependently, by the Cambridge mathematician Adams, and the French\r\nastronomer Le Verrier. The discovery of Neptune differed, however, from\r\nthat of Uranus in the following respect. Uranus was found merely in the\r\ncourse of ordinary telescopic survey of the heavens. The position of\r\nNeptune, on the other hand, was predicted as the result of rigorous\r\nmathematical investigations undertaken with the object of fixing the\r\nposition of an unseen and still more distant body, the attraction of\r\nwhich, in passing by, was disturbing the position of Uranus in its\r\nrevolution around the sun. Adams actually completed his investigation\r\nfirst; but a delay at Cambridge in examining that portion of the sky,\r\nwhere he announced that the body ought just then to be, allowed France\r\nto snatch the honour of discovery, and the new planet was found by the\r\nobserver Galle at Berlin, very near the place in the heavens which Le\r\nVerrier had mathematically predicted for it.\r\n\r\nNearly fifty years later, that is to say, in our own time, another\r\nimportant planetary discovery was made. One of the recent additions to\r\nthe numerous and constantly increasing family of the asteroids, a tiny\r\nbody brought to light in 1898, turned out after all not to be\r\ncirculating in the customary space between Mars and Jupiter, but\r\nactually in that between our earth and Mars. This body is very small,\r\nnot more than about twenty miles across. It has received the name of\r\nEros (the Greek equivalent for Cupid), in allusion to its insignificant\r\nsize as compared with the other leading members of the system.\r\n\r\nThis completes the list of the planets which, so far, have revealed\r\nthemselves to us. Whether others exist time alone will show. Two or\r\nthree have been suspected to revolve beyond the path of Neptune; and it\r\nhas even been asserted, on more than one occasion, that a planet\r\ncirculates nearer to the sun than Mercury. This supposed body, to which\r\nthe name of \"Vulcan\" was provisionally given, is said to have been\r\n\"discovered\" in 1859 by a French doctor named Lescarbault, of Orgères\r\nnear Orleans; but up to the present there has been no sufficient\r\nevidence of its existence. The reason why such uncertainty should exist\r\nupon this point is easy enough to understand, when we consider the\r\noverpowering glare which fills our atmosphere all around the sun's place\r\nin the sky. Mercury, the nearest known planet to the sun, is for this\r\nreason always very difficult to see; and even when, in its course, it\r\ngets sufficiently far from the sun to be left for a short time above the\r\nhorizon after sunset, it is by no means an easy object to observe on\r\naccount of the mists which usually hang about low down near the earth.\r\nOne opportunity, however, offers itself from time to time to solve the\r\nriddle of an \"intra-Mercurial\" planet, that is to say, of a planet which\r\ncirculates within the path followed by Mercury. The opportunity in\r\nquestion is furnished by a total eclipse of the sun; for when, during an\r\neclipse of that kind, the body of the moon for a few minutes entirely\r\nhides the sun's face, and the dazzling glare is thus completely cut off,\r\nastronomers are enabled to give an unimpeded, though all too hurried,\r\nsearch to the region close around. A goodly number of total eclipses of\r\nthe sun have, however, come and gone since the days of Lescarbault, and\r\nno planet, so far, has revealed itself in the intra-Mercurial space. It\r\nseems, therefore, quite safe to affirm that no globe of sufficient size\r\nto be seen by means of our modern telescopes circulates nearer to the\r\nsun than the planet Mercury.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the planets, as permanent members of the solar\r\nsystem, come the relatively small and secondary bodies known by the name\r\nof Satellites. The name _satellite_ is derived from a Latin word\r\nsignifying _an attendant_; for the bodies so-called move along always in\r\nclose proximity to their respective \"primaries,\" as the planets which\r\nthey accompany are technically termed.\r\n\r\nThe satellites cannot be considered as allotted with any particular\r\nregularity among the various members of the system; several of the\r\nplanets, for instance, having a goodly number of these bodies\r\naccompanying them, while others have but one or two, and some again have\r\nnone at all. Taking the planets in their order of distance outward from\r\nthe Sun, we find that neither Mercury nor Venus are provided with\r\nsatellites; the Earth has only one, viz. our neighbour the Moon; while\r\nMars has but two tiny ones, so small indeed that one might imagine them\r\nto be merely asteroids, which had wandered out of their proper region\r\nand attached themselves to that planet. For the rest, so far as we at\r\npresent know, Jupiter possesses seven,[2] Saturn ten, Uranus four, and\r\nNeptune one. It is indeed possible, nay more, it is extremely probable,\r\nthat the two last-named planets have a greater number of these secondary\r\nbodies revolving around them; but, unfortunately, the Uranian and\r\nNeptunian systems are at such immense distances from us, that even the\r\nmagnificent telescopes of to-day can extract very little information\r\nconcerning them.\r\n\r\nFrom the distribution of the satellites, the reader will notice that the\r\nplanets relatively near to the sun are provided with few or none, while\r\nthe more distant planets are richly endowed. The conclusion, therefore,\r\nseems to be that nearness to the sun is in some way unfavourable either\r\nto the production, or to the continued existence, of satellites.\r\n\r\nA planet and its satellites form a repetition of the solar system on a\r\ntiny scale. Just as the planets revolve around the sun, so do these\r\nsecondary bodies revolve around their primaries. When Galileo, in 1610,\r\nturned his newly invented telescope upon Jupiter, he quickly recognised\r\nin the four circling moons which met his gaze, a miniature edition of\r\nthe solar system.\r\n\r\nBesides the planets and their satellites, there are two other classes of\r\nbodies which claim membership of the solar system. These are Comets and\r\nMeteors. Comets differ from the bodies which we have just been\r\ndescribing in that they appear filmy and transparent, whereas the others\r\nare solid and opaque. Again, the paths of the planets around the sun and\r\nof the satellites around their primaries are not actually circles; they\r\nare ovals, but their ovalness is not of a marked degree. The paths of\r\ncomets on the other hand are usually _very_ oval; so that in their\r\ncourses many of them pass out as far as the known limits of the solar\r\nsystem, and even far beyond. It should be mentioned that nowadays the\r\ntendency is to consider comets as permanent members of the system,\r\nthough this was formerly not by any means an article of faith with\r\nastronomers.\r\n\r\nMeteors are very small bodies, as a rule perhaps no larger than pebbles,\r\nwhich move about unseen in space, and of which we do not become aware\r\nuntil they arrive very close to the earth. They are then made visible to\r\nus for a moment or two in consequence of being heated to a white heat by\r\nthe friction of rushing through the atmosphere, and are thus usually\r\nturned into ashes and vapour long before they reach the surface of our\r\nglobe. Though occasionally a meteoric body survives the fiery ordeal,\r\nand reaches the earth more or less in a solid state to bury itself deep\r\nin the soil, the majority of these celestial visitants constitute no\r\nsource of danger whatever for us. Any one who will take the trouble to\r\ngaze at the sky for a short time on a clear night, is fairly certain to\r\nbe rewarded with the view of a meteor. The impression received is as if\r\none of the stars had suddenly left its accustomed place, and dashed\r\nacross the heavens, leaving in its course a trail of light. It is for\r\nthis reason that meteors are popularly known under the name of \"shooting\r\nstars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] By the Italian astronomer, Piazzi, at Palermo.\r\n\r\n[2] Probably eight. (See note, page 232.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in the course of the last chapter, that the solar system\r\nis composed as follows:--there is a central body, the sun, around which\r\nrevolve along stated paths a number of important bodies known as\r\nplanets. Certain of these planets, in their courses, carry along in\r\ncompany still smaller bodies called satellites, which revolve around\r\nthem. With regard, however, to the remaining members of the system, viz.\r\nthe comets and the meteors, it is not advisable at this stage to add\r\nmore to what has been said in the preceding chapter. For the time being,\r\ntherefore, we will devote our attention merely to the sun, the planets,\r\nand the satellites.\r\n\r\nOf what shape then are these bodies? Of one shape, and that one alone\r\nwhich appears to characterise all solid objects in the celestial spaces:\r\nthey are spherical, which means _round like a ball_.\r\n\r\nEach of these spherical bodies rotates; that is to say, turns round and\r\nround, as a top does when it is spinning. This rotation is said to take\r\nplace \"upon an axis,\" a statement which may be explained as\r\nfollows:--Imagine a ball with a knitting-needle run right through its\r\ncentre. Then imagine this needle held pointing in one fixed direction\r\nwhile the ball is turned round and round. Well, it is the same thing\r\nwith the earth. As it journeys about the sun, it keeps turning round and\r\nround continually as if pivoted upon a mighty knitting needle\r\ntransfixing it from North Pole to South Pole. In reality, however, there\r\nis no such material axis to regulate the constant direction of the\r\nrotation, just as there are no actual supports to uphold the earth\r\nitself in space. The causes which keep the celestial spheres poised, and\r\nwhich control their motions, are far more wonderful than any mechanical\r\ndevice.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture it will be well to emphasise the sharp distinction\r\nbetween the terms _rotation_ and _revolution_. The term \"rotation\" is\r\ninvariably used by astronomers to signify the motion which a celestial\r\nbody has upon an axis; the term \"revolution,\" on the other hand, is used\r\nfor the movement of one celestial body around another. Speaking of the\r\nearth, for instance, we say, that it _rotates_ on its axis, and that it\r\n_revolves_ around the sun.\r\n\r\nSo far, nothing has been said about the sizes of the members of our\r\nsystem. Is there any stock size, any pattern according to which they may\r\nbe judged? None whatever! They vary enormously. Very much the largest of\r\nall is the Sun, which is several hundred times larger than all the\r\nplanets and satellites of the system rolled together. Next comes Jupiter\r\nand afterwards the other planets in the following order of\r\nsize:--Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, the Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury.\r\nVery much smaller than any of these are the asteroids, of which Ceres,\r\nthe largest, is less than 500 miles in diameter. It is, by the way, a\r\nstrange fact that the zone of asteroids should mark the separation of\r\nthe small planets from the giant ones. The following table, giving\r\nroughly the various diameters of the sun and the principal planets in\r\nmiles, will clearly illustrate the great discrepancy in size which\r\nprevails in the system.\r\n\r\nSun          866,540 miles\r\nMercury        2,765  \"\r\nVenus          7,826  \"\r\nEarth          7,918  \"\r\nMars           4,332  \"\r\n\r\nZONE OF ASTEROIDS\r\n\r\nJupiter       87,380  \"\r\nSaturn        73,125  \"\r\nUranus[3]     34,900  \"\r\nNeptune[3]    32,900  \"\r\n\r\nIt does not seem possible to arrive at any generalisation from the above\r\ndata, except it be to state that there is a continuous increase in size\r\nfrom Mercury to the earth, and a similar decrease in size from Jupiter\r\noutwards. Were Mars greater than the earth, the planets could then with\r\ntruth be said to increase in size up to Jupiter, and then to decrease.\r\nBut the zone of asteroids, and the relative smallness of Mars, negative\r\nany attempt to regard the dimensions of the planets as an orderly\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\nNext with respect to relative distance from the sun, Venus circulates\r\nnearly twice as far from it as Mercury, the earth nearly three times as\r\nfar, and Mars nearly four times. After this, just as we found a sudden\r\nincrease in size, so do we meet with a sudden increase in distance.\r\nJupiter, for instance, is about thirteen times as far as Mercury, Saturn\r\nabout twenty-five times, Uranus about forty-nine times, and Neptune\r\nabout seventy-seven. (See Fig. 2, p. 21.)\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen how enormously the solar system was enlarged in\r\nextent by the discovery of the outermost planets. The finding of Uranus\r\nplainly doubled its breadth; the finding of Neptune made it more than\r\nhalf as broad again. Nothing indeed can better show the import of these\r\ngreat discoveries than to take a pair of compasses and roughly set out\r\nthe above relative paths in a series of concentric circles upon a large\r\nsheet of paper, and then to consider that the path of Saturn was the\r\nsupposed boundary of our solar system prior to the year 1781.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the usual shape of celestial bodies themselves is\r\nspherical. Of what form then are their paths, or _orbits_, as these are\r\ncalled? One might be inclined at a venture to answer \"circular,\" but\r\nthis is not the case. The orbits of the planets cannot be regarded as\r\ntrue circles. They are ovals, or, to speak in technical language,\r\n\"ellipses.\" Their ovalness or \"ellipticity\" is, however, in each case\r\nnot by any means of the same degree. Some orbits--for instance, that of\r\nthe earth--differ only slightly from circles; while others--those of\r\nMars or Mercury, for example--are markedly elliptic. The orbit of the\r\ntiny planet Eros is, however, far and away the most elliptic of all, as\r\nwe shall see when we come to deal with that little planet in detail.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the sun and planets are always rotating. The\r\nvarious rates at which they do so will, however, be best appreciated by\r\na comparison with the rate at which the earth itself rotates.\r\n\r\nBut first of all, let us see what ground we have, if any, for asserting\r\nthat the earth rotates at all?\r\n\r\nIf we carefully watch the heavens we notice that the background of the\r\nsky, with all the brilliant objects which sparkle in it, appears to turn\r\nonce round us in about twenty-four hours; and that the pivot upon which\r\nthis movement takes place is situated somewhere near what is known to us\r\nas the _Pole Star_. This was one of the earliest facts noted with regard\r\nto the sky; and to the men of old it therefore seems as if the heavens\r\nand all therein were always revolving around the earth. It was natural\r\nenough for them to take this view, for they had not the slightest idea\r\nof the immense distance of the celestial bodies, and in the absence of\r\nany knowledge of the kind they were inclined to imagine them\r\ncomparatively near. It was indeed only after the lapse of many\r\ncenturies, when men had at last realised the enormous gulf which\r\nseparated them from even the nearest object in the sky, that a more\r\nreasonable opinion began to prevail. It was then seen that this\r\nrevolution of the heavens about the earth could be more easily and more\r\nsatisfactorily explained by supposing a mere rotation of the solid earth\r\nabout a fixed axis, pointed in the direction of the polar star. The\r\nprobability of such a rotation on the part of the earth itself was\r\nfurther strengthened by the observations made with the telescope. When\r\nthe surfaces of the sun and planets were carefully studied these bodies\r\nwere seen to be rotating. This being the case, there could not surely\r\nbe much hesitation in granting that the earth rotated also; particularly\r\nwhen it so simply explained the daily movement of the sky, and saved men\r\nfrom the almost inconceivable notion that the whole stupendous vaulted\r\nheaven was turning about them once in every twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIf the sun be regularly observed through a telescope, it will gradually\r\nbe gathered from the slow displacement of sunspots across its face,\r\ntheir disappearance at one edge and their reappearance again at the\r\nother edge, that it is rotating on an axis in a period of about\r\ntwenty-six days. The movement, too, of various well-known markings on\r\nthe surfaces of the planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn proves to us that\r\nthese bodies are rotating in periods, which are about twenty-four hours\r\nfor the first, and about ten hours for each of the other two. With\r\nregard, however, to Uranus and Neptune there is much more uncertainty,\r\nas these planets are at such great distances that even our best\r\ntelescopes give but a confused view of the markings which they display;\r\nstill a period of rotation of from ten to twelve hours appears to be\r\naccepted for them. On the other hand the constant blaze of sunlight in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Mercury and Venus equally hampers astronomers in\r\nthis quest. The older telescopic observers considered that the rotation\r\nperiods of these two planets were about the same as that of the earth;\r\nbut of recent years the opinion has been gaining ground that they turn\r\nround on their axes in exactly the same time as they revolve about the\r\nsun. This question is, however, a very doubtful one, and will be again\r\nreferred to later on; but, putting it on one side, it will be seen from\r\nwhat we have said above, that the rotation periods of the other planets\r\nof our system are usually about twenty-four hours, or under. The fact\r\nthat the rotation period of the sun should run into _days_ need not seem\r\nextraordinary when one considers its enormous size.\r\n\r\nThe periods taken by the various planets to revolve around the sun is\r\nthe next point which has to be considered. Here, too, it is well to\r\nstart with the earth's period of revolution as the standard, and to see\r\nhow the periods taken by the other planets compare with it.\r\n\r\nThe earth takes about 365-1/4 days to revolve around the sun. This\r\nperiod of time is known to us as a \"year.\" The following table shows in\r\ndays and years the periods taken by each of the other planets to make a\r\ncomplete revolution round the sun:--\r\n\r\nMercury  about  88 days.\r\nVenus     \"    226   \"\r\nMars      \"      1 year and 321 days.\r\nJupiter   \"     11 years and 313 days.\r\nSaturn    \"     29 years and 167 days.\r\nUranus    \"     84 years and 7 days.\r\nNeptune   \"    164 years and 284 days.\r\n\r\nFrom these periods we gather an important fact, namely, that the nearer\r\na planet is to the sun the faster it revolves.\r\n\r\nCompared with one of our years what a long time does an Uranian, or\r\nNeptunian, \"year\" seem? For instance, if a \"year\" had commenced in\r\nNeptune about the middle of the reign of George II., that \"year\" would\r\nbe only just coming to a close; for the planet is but now arriving back\r\nto the position, with regard to the sun, which it then occupied. Uranus,\r\ntoo, has only completed a little more than 1-1/2 of its \"years\" since\r\nHerschel discovered it.\r\n\r\nHaving accepted the fact that the planets are revolving around the sun,\r\nthe next point to be inquired into is:--What are the positions of their\r\norbits, or paths, relatively to each other?\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, the various planetary orbits to be represented by\r\na set of hoops of different sizes, placed one within the other, and the\r\nsun by a small ball in the middle of the whole; in what positions will\r\nthese hoops have to be arranged so as to imitate exactly the true\r\ncondition of things?\r\n\r\nFirst of all let us suppose the entire arrangement, ball and hoops, to\r\nbe on one level, so to speak. This may be easily compassed by imagining\r\nthe hoops as floating, one surrounding the other, with the ball in the\r\nmiddle of all, upon the surface of still water. Such a set of objects\r\nwould be described in astronomical parlance as being _in the same\r\nplane_. Suppose, on the other hand, that some of these floating hoops\r\nare tilted with regard to the others, so that one half of a hoop rises\r\nout of the water and the other half consequently sinks beneath the\r\nsurface. This indeed is the actual case with regard to the planetary\r\norbits. They do not by any means lie all exactly in the same plane. Each\r\none of them is tilted, or _inclined_, a little with respect to the plane\r\nof the earth's orbit, which astronomers, for convenience, regard as the\r\n_level_ of the solar system. This tilting, or \"inclination,\" is, in the\r\nlarger planets, greatest for the orbit of Mercury, least for that of\r\nUranus. Mercury's orbit is inclined to that of the earth at an angle of\r\nabout 7°, that of Venus at a little over 3°, that of Saturn 2-1/2°;\r\nwhile in those of Mars, Neptune, and Jupiter the inclination is less\r\nthan 2°. But greater than any of these is the inclination of the orbit\r\nof the tiny planet Eros, viz. nearly 11°.\r\n\r\nThe systems of satellites revolving around their respective planets\r\nbeing, as we have already pointed out, mere miniature editions of the\r\nsolar system, the considerations so far detailed, which regulate the\r\nbehaviour of the planets in their relations to the sun, will of\r\nnecessity apply to the satellites very closely. In one respect, however,\r\na system of satellites differs materially from a system of planets. The\r\ncentral body around which planets are in motion is self-luminous,\r\nwhereas the planetary body around which a satellite revolves is not.\r\nTrue, planets shine, and shine very brightly too; as, for instance,\r\nVenus and Jupiter. But they do not give forth any light of their own, as\r\nthe sun does; they merely reflect the sunlight which they receive from\r\nhim. Putting this one fact aside, the analogy between the planetary\r\nsystem and a satellite system is remarkable. The satellites are\r\nspherical in form, and differ markedly in size; they rotate, so far as\r\nwe know, upon their axes in varying times; they revolve around their\r\ngoverning planets in orbits, not circular, but elliptic; and these\r\norbits, furthermore, do not of necessity lie in the same plane. Last of\r\nall the satellites revolve around their primaries at rates which are\r\ndirectly comparable with those at which the planets revolve around the\r\nsun, the rule in fact holding good that the nearer a satellite is to its\r\nprimary the faster it revolves.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] As there seems to be much difference of opinion concerning the\r\ndiameters of Uranus and Neptune, it should here be mentioned that the\r\nabove figures are taken from Professor F.R. Moulton's _Introduction to\r\nAstronomy_ (1906). They are there stated to be given on the authority of\r\n\"Barnard's many measures at the Lick Observatory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCELESTIAL MECHANISM\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as we begin to inquire closely into the actual condition of the\r\nvarious members of the solar system we are struck with a certain\r\ndistinction. We find that there are two quite different points of view\r\nfrom which these bodies can be regarded. For instance, we may make our\r\nestimates of them either as regards _volume_--that is to say, the mere\r\nroom which they take up; or as regards _mass_--that is to say, the\r\namount of matter which they contain.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine two globes of equal volume; in other words, which take up\r\nan equal amount of space. One of these globes, however, may be composed\r\nof material much more tightly put together than in the other; or of\r\ngreater _density_, as the term goes. That globe is said to be the\r\ngreater of the two in mass. Were such a pair of globes to be weighed in\r\nscales, one globe in each pan, we should see at once, by its weighing\r\ndown the other, which of the two was composed of the more tightly packed\r\nmaterials; and we should, in astronomical parlance, say of this one that\r\nit had the greater mass.\r\n\r\nVolume being merely another word for size, the order of the members of\r\nthe solar system, with regard to their volumes, will be as follows,\r\nbeginning with the greatest:--the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,\r\nNeptune, the Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury.\r\n\r\nWith regard to mass the same order strangely enough holds good. The\r\nactual densities of the bodies in question are, however, very different.\r\nThe densest or closest packed body of all is the Earth, which is about\r\nfive and a half times as dense as if it were composed entirely of water.\r\nVenus follows next, then Mars, and then Mercury. The remaining bodies,\r\non the other hand, are relatively loose in structure. Saturn is the\r\nleast dense of all, less so than water. The density of the Sun is a\r\nlittle greater than that of water.\r\n\r\nThis method of estimating is, however, subject to a qualification. It\r\nmust be remembered that in speaking of the Sun, for instance, as being\r\nonly a little denser than water, we are merely treating the question\r\nfrom the point of view of an average. Certain parts of it in fact will\r\nbe ever so much denser than water: those are the parts in the centre.\r\nOther portions, for instance, the outside portions, will be very much\r\nless dense. It will easily be understood that in all such bodies the\r\ndensest or most compressed portions are to be found towards the centre;\r\nwhile the portions towards the exterior being less pressed upon, will be\r\nless dense.\r\n\r\nWe now reach a very important point, the question of Gravitation.\r\n_Gravitation_, or _gravity_, as it is often called, is the attractive\r\nforce which, for instance, causes objects to fall to the earth. Now it\r\nseems rather strange that one should say that it is owing to a certain\r\nforce that things fall towards the earth. All things seem to us to fall\r\nso of their own accord, as if it were quite natural, or rather most\r\nunnatural if they did not. Why then require a \"force\" to make them fall?\r\n\r\nThe story goes that the great Sir Isaac Newton was set a-thinking on\r\nthis subject by seeing an apple fall from a tree to the earth. He then\r\ncarried the train of thought further; and, by studying the movements of\r\nthe moon, he reached the conclusion that a body even so far off as our\r\nsatellite would be drawn towards the earth in the same manner. This\r\nbeing the case, one will naturally ask why the moon herself does not\r\nfall in upon the earth. The answer is indeed found to be that the moon\r\nis travelling round and round the earth at a certain rapid pace, and it\r\nis this very same rapid pace which keeps her from falling in upon us.\r\nAny one can test this simple fact for himself. If we tie a stone to the\r\nend of a string, and keep whirling it round and round fast enough, there\r\nwill be a strong pull from the stone in an outward direction, and the\r\nstring will remain tight all the time that the stone is being whirled.\r\nIf, however, we gradually slacken the speed at which we are making the\r\nstone whirl, a moment will come at length when the string will become\r\nlimp, and the stone will fall back towards our hand.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, that there are two causes which maintain the stone\r\nat a regular distance all the time it is being steadily whirled. One of\r\nthese is the continual pull inward towards our hand by means of the\r\nstring. The other is the continual pull away from us caused by the rate\r\nat which the stone is travelling. When the rate of whirling is so\r\nregulated that these pulls exactly balance each other, the stone travels\r\ncomfortably round and round, and shows no tendency either to fall back\r\nupon our hand or to break the string and fly away into the air. It is\r\nindeed precisely similar with regard to the moon. The continual pull of\r\nthe earth's gravitation takes the place of the string. If the moon were\r\nto go round and round slower than it does, it would tend to fall in\r\ntowards the earth; if, on the other hand, it were to go faster, it would\r\ntend to rush away into space.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of pull which the earth exerts upon the objects at its\r\nsurface, or upon its satellite, the moon, exists through space so far as\r\nwe know. Every particle of matter in the universe is found in fact to\r\nattract every other particle. The moon, for instance, attracts the earth\r\nalso, but the controlling force is on the side of the much greater mass\r\nof the earth. This force of gravity or attraction of gravitation, as it\r\nis also called, is perfectly regular in its action. Its power depends\r\nfirst of all exactly upon the mass of the body which exerts it. The\r\ngravitational pull of the sun, for instance, reaches out to an enormous\r\ndistance, controlling perhaps, in their courses, unseen planets circling\r\nfar beyond the orbit of Neptune. Again, the strength with which the\r\nforce of gravity acts depends upon distance in a regularly diminishing\r\nproportion. Thus, the nearer an object is to the earth, for instance,\r\nthe stronger is the gravitational pull which it gets from it; the\r\nfarther off it is, the weaker is this pull. If then the moon were to be\r\nbrought nearer to the earth, the gravitational pull of the latter would\r\nbecome so much stronger that the moon's rate of motion would have also\r\nto increase in due proportion to prevent her from being drawn into the\r\nearth. Last of all, the point in a body from which the attraction of\r\ngravitation acts, is not necessarily the centre of the body, but rather\r\nwhat is known as its _centre of gravity_, that is to say, the balancing\r\npoint of all the matter which the body contains.\r\n\r\nIt should here be noted that the moon does not actually revolve around\r\nthe centre of gravity of the earth. What really happens is that both\r\norbs revolve around their _common_ centre of gravity, which is a point\r\nwithin the body of the earth, and situated about three thousand miles\r\nfrom its centre. In the same manner the planets and the sun revolve\r\naround the centre of gravity of the solar system, which is a point\r\nwithin the body of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe neatly poised movements of the planets around the sun, and of the\r\nsatellites around their respective planets, will therefore be readily\r\nunderstood to result from a nice balance between gravitation and speed\r\nof motion.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the earth is ascertained to be about eighty times that of\r\nthe moon. Our knowledge of the mass of a planet is learned from\r\ncomparing the revolutions of its satellite or satellites around it, with\r\nthose of the moon around the earth. We are thus enabled to deduce what\r\nthe mass of such a planet would be compared to the earth's mass; that is\r\nto say, a study, for instance, of Jupiter's satellite system shows that\r\nJupiter must have a mass nearly three hundred and eighteen times that of\r\nour earth. In the same manner we can argue out the mass of the sun from\r\nthe movements of the planets and other bodies of the system around it.\r\nWith regard, however, to Venus and Mercury, the problem is by no means\r\nsuch an easy one, as these bodies have no satellites. For information in\r\nthis latter case we have to rely upon such uncertain evidence as, for\r\ninstance, the slight disturbances caused in the motion of the earth by\r\nthe attraction of these planets when they pass closest to us, or their\r\nobserved effect upon the motions of such comets as may happen to pass\r\nnear to them.\r\n\r\nMass and weight, though often spoken of as one and the same thing, are\r\nby no means so. Mass, as we have seen, merely means the amount of matter\r\nwhich a body contains. The weight of a body, on the other hand, depends\r\nentirely upon the gravitational pull which it receives. The force of\r\ngravity at the surface of the earth is, for instance, about six times as\r\ngreat as that at the surface of the moon. All bodies, therefore, weigh\r\nabout six times as much on the earth as they would upon the moon; or,\r\nrather, a body transferred to the moon's surface would weigh only about\r\none-sixth of what it did on the terrestrial surface. It will therefore\r\nbe seen that if a body of given _mass_ were to be placed upon planet\r\nafter planet in turn, its _weight_ would regularly alter according to\r\nthe force of gravity at each planet's surface.\r\n\r\nGravitation is indeed one of the greatest mysteries of nature. What it\r\nis, the means by which it acts, or why such a force should exist at all,\r\nare questions to which so far we have not had even the merest hint of an\r\nanswer. Its action across space appears to be instantaneous.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of gravitation is said in mathematical parlance \"to vary\r\ninversely with the square of the distance.\" This means that at _twice_\r\nthe distance the pull will become only _one-quarter_ as strong, and not\r\none-half as otherwise might be expected. At _four_ times the distance,\r\ntherefore, it will be _one-sixteenth_ as strong. At the earth's surface\r\na body is pulled by the earth's gravitation, or \"falls,\" as we\r\nordinarily term it, through 16 feet in one _second_ of time; whereas at\r\nthe distance of the moon the attraction of the earth is so very much\r\nweakened that a body would take as long as one _minute_ to fall through\r\nthe same space.\r\n\r\nNewton's investigations showed that if a body were to be placed _at\r\nrest_ in space entirely away from the attraction of any other body it\r\nwould remain always in a motionless condition, because there would\r\nplainly be no reason why it should move in any one direction rather than\r\nin another. And, similarly, if a body were to be projected in a certain\r\ndirection and at a certain speed, it would move always in the same\r\ndirection and at the same speed so long as it did not come within the\r\ngravitational attraction of any other body.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of an interaction between the celestial orbs had\r\noccurred to astronomers before the time of Newton; for instance, in the\r\nninth century to the Arabian Musa-ben-Shakir, to Camillus Agrippa in\r\n1553, and to Kepler, who suspected its existence from observation of the\r\ntides. Horrox also, writing in 1635, spoke of the moon as moved by an\r\n_emanation_ from the earth. But no one prior to Newton attempted to\r\nexamine the question from a mathematical standpoint.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the acknowledged truth and far-reaching scope of the law\r\nof gravitation--for we find its effects exemplified in every portion of\r\nthe universe--there are yet some minor movements which it does not\r\naccount for. For instance, there are small irregularities in the\r\nmovement of Mercury which cannot be explained by the influence of\r\npossible intra-Mercurial planets, and similarly there are slight\r\nunaccountable deviations in the motions of our neighbour the Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCELESTIAL DISTANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this we have merely taken a general view of the solar system--a\r\nbird's-eye view, so to speak, from space.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our inquiry we noted in a rough way the _relative_\r\ndistances at which the various planets move around the sun. But we have\r\nnot yet stated what these distances _actually_ are, and it were\r\ntherefore well now to turn our attention to this important matter.\r\n\r\nEach of us has a fair idea of what a mile is. It is a quarter of an\r\nhour's sharp walk, for instance; or yonder village or building, we know,\r\nlies such and such a number of miles away.\r\n\r\nThe measurements which have already been given of the diameters of the\r\nvarious bodies of the solar system appear very great to us, who find\r\nthat a walk of a few miles at a time taxes our strength; but they are a\r\nmere nothing when we consider the distances from the sun at which the\r\nvarious planets revolve in their orbits.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives these distances in round numbers. As here\r\nstated they are what are called \"mean\" distances; for, as the orbits are\r\noval, the planets vary in their distances from the sun, and we are\r\ntherefore obliged to strike a kind of average for each case:--\r\n\r\nMercury  about   36,000,000 miles.\r\nVenus      \"     67,200,000  \"\r\nEarth      \"     92,900,000  \"\r\nMars       \"    141,500,000  \"\r\nJupiter    \"    483,300,000  \"\r\nSaturn     \"    886,000,000  \"\r\nUranus     \"  1,781,900,000  \"\r\nNeptune    \"  2,791,600,000  \"\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be seen at a glance that we have entered upon a\r\nstill greater scale of distance than in dealing with the diameters of\r\nthe various bodies of the system. In that case the distances were\r\nlimited to thousands of miles; in this, however, we have to deal with\r\nmillions. A million being ten hundred thousand, it will be noticed that\r\neven the diameter of the huge sun is well under a million miles.\r\n\r\nHow indeed are we to get a grasp of such distances, when those to which\r\nwe are ordinarily accustomed--the few miles' walk, the little stretch of\r\nsea or land which we gaze upon around us--are so utterly minute in\r\ncomparison? The fact is, that though men may think that they can picture\r\nin their minds such immense distances, they actually can not. In matters\r\nlike these we unconsciously employ a kind of convention, and we estimate\r\na thing as being two or three or more times the size of another. More\r\nthan this we are unable to do. For instance, our ordinary experience of\r\na mile enables us to judge, in a way, of a stretch of several miles,\r\nsuch as one can take in with a glance; but in our estimation of a\r\nthousand miles, or even of one hundred, we are driven back upon a mental\r\ntrick, so to speak.\r\n\r\nIn our attempts to realise such immense distances as those in the solar\r\nsystem we are obliged to have recourse to analogies; to comparisons with\r\nother and simpler facts, though this is at the best a mere self-cheating\r\ndevice. The analogy which seems most suited to our purpose here, and one\r\nwhich has often been employed by writers, is borrowed from the rate at\r\nwhich an express train travels.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine, for instance, that we possess an express train which is\r\ncapable of running anywhere, never stops, never requires fuel, and\r\nalways goes along at sixty miles an hour. Suppose we commence by\r\nemploying it to gauge the size of our own planet, the earth. Let us send\r\nit on a trip around the equator, the span of which is about 24,000\r\nmiles. At its sixty-miles-an-hour rate of going, this journey will take\r\nnearly 17 days. Next let us send it from the earth to the moon. This\r\ndistance, 240,000 miles, being ten times as great as the last, will of\r\ncourse take ten times as long to cover, namely, 170 days; that is to\r\nsay, nearly half a year. Again, let us send it still further afield, to\r\nthe sun, for example. Here, however, it enters upon a journey which is\r\nnot to be measured in thousands of miles, as the others were, but in\r\nmillions. The distance from the earth to the sun, as we have seen in the\r\nforegoing table, is about 93 millions of miles. Our express train would\r\ntake about 178 _years_ to traverse this.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the sun, let us suppose that our train makes a tour\r\nright round it. This will take more than five years.\r\n\r\nSupposing, finally, that our train were started from the sun, and made\r\nto run straight out to the known boundaries of the solar system, that is\r\nto say, as far as the orbit of Neptune, it would take over 5000 years to\r\ntraverse the distance.\r\n\r\nThat sixty miles an hour is a very great speed any one, I think, will\r\nadmit who has stood upon the platform of a country station while one of\r\nthe great mail trains has dashed past. But are not the immensities of\r\nspace appalling to contemplate, when one realises that a body moving\r\nincessantly at such a rate would take so long as 10,000 years to\r\ntraverse merely the breadth of our solar system? Ten thousand years!\r\nJust try to conceive it. Why, it is only a little more than half that\r\ntime since the Pyramids were built, and they mark for us the Dawn of\r\nHistory. And since then half-a-dozen mighty empires have come and gone!\r\n\r\nHaving thus concluded our general survey of the appearance and\r\ndimensions of the solar system, let us next inquire into its position\r\nand size in relation to what we call the Universe.\r\n\r\nA mere glance at the night sky, when it is free from clouds, shows us\r\nthat in every direction there are stars; and this holds good, no matter\r\nwhat portion of the globe we visit. The same is really true of the sky\r\nby day, though in that case we cannot actually see the stars, for their\r\nlight is quite overpowered by the dazzling light of the sun.\r\n\r\nWe thus reach the conclusion that our earth, that our solar system in\r\nfact, lies plunged within the midst of a great tangle of stars. What\r\nposition, by the way, do we occupy in this mighty maze? Are we at the\r\ncentre, or anywhere near the centre, or where?\r\n\r\nIt has been indeed amply proved by astronomical research that the stars\r\nare bodies giving off a light of their own, just as our sun does; that\r\nthey are in fact suns, and that our sun is merely one, perhaps indeed a\r\nvery unimportant member, of this great universe of stars. Each of these\r\nstars, or suns, besides, may be the centre of a system similar to what\r\nwe call our solar system, comprising planets and satellites, comets and\r\nmeteors;--or perchance indeed some further variety of attendant bodies\r\nof which we have no example in our tiny corner of space. But as to\r\nwhether one is right in a conjecture of this kind, there is up to the\r\npresent no proof whatever. No telescope has yet shown a planet in\r\nattendance upon one of these distant suns; for such bodies, even if they\r\ndo exist, are entirely out of the range of our mightiest instruments. On\r\nwhat then can we ground such an assumption? Merely upon analogy; upon\r\nthe common-sense deduction that as the stars have characteristics\r\nsimilar to our particular star, the sun, it would seem unlikely that\r\nours should be the only such body in the whole of space which is\r\nattended by a planetary system.\r\n\r\n\"The Stars,\" using that expression in its most general sense, do not lie\r\nat one fixed distance from us, set here and there upon a background of\r\nsky. There is in fact no background at all. The brilliant orbs are all\r\naround us in space, at different distances from us and from each other;\r\nand we can gaze between them out into the blackness of the void which,\r\nperhaps, continues to extend unceasingly long after the very outposts of\r\nthe stellar universe has been left behind. Shall we then start our\r\nimaginary express train once more, and send it out towards the nearest\r\nof the stars? This would, however, be a useless experiment. Our\r\nexpress-train method of gauging space would fail miserably in the\r\nattempt to bring home to us the mighty gulf by which we are now faced.\r\nLet us therefore halt for a moment and look back upon the orders of\r\ndistance with which we have been dealing. First of all we dealt with\r\nthousands of miles. Next we saw how they shrank into insignificance when\r\nwe embarked upon millions. We found, indeed, that our sixty-mile-an-hour\r\ntrain, rushing along without ceasing, would consume nearly the whole of\r\nhistorical time in a journey from the sun to Neptune.\r\n\r\nIn the spaces beyond the solar system we are faced, however, by a new\r\norder of distance. From sun to planets is measured in millions of miles,\r\nbut from sun to sun is measured in billions. But does the mere stating\r\nof this fact convey anything? I fear not. For the word \"billion\" runs as\r\nglibly off the tongue as \"million,\" and both are so wholly unrealisable\r\nby us that the actual difference between them might easily pass\r\nunnoticed.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, make a careful comparison. What is a million? It is a\r\nthousand thousands. But what is a billion? It is a million millions.\r\nConsider for a moment! A million of millions. That means a million, each\r\nunit of which is again a million. In fact every separate \"1\" in this\r\nmillion is itself a million. Here is a way of trying to realise this\r\ngigantic number. A million seconds make only eleven and a half days and\r\nnights. But a billion seconds will make actually more than thirty\r\nthousand years!\r\n\r\nHaving accepted this, let us try and probe with our express train even a\r\nlittle of the new gulf which now lies before us. At our old rate of\r\ngoing it took almost two years to cover a million miles. To cover a\r\nbillion miles--that is to say, a million times this distance--would thus\r\ntake of course nearly two million years. Alpha Centauri, the nearest\r\nstar to our earth, is some twenty-five billions of miles away. Our\r\nexpress train would thus take about fifty millions of years to reach it!\r\n\r\nThis shows how useless our illustration, appropriate though it seemed\r\nfor interplanetary space, becomes when applied to the interstellar\r\nspaces. It merely gives us millions in return for billions; and so the\r\nmind, driven in upon itself, whirls round and round like a squirrel in\r\nits revolving cage. There is, however, a useful illustration still left\r\nus, and it is the one which astronomers usually employ in dealing with\r\nthe distances of the stars. The illustration in question is taken from\r\nthe velocity of light.\r\n\r\nLight travels at the tremendous speed of about 186,000 miles a second.\r\nIt therefore takes only about a second and a quarter to come to us from\r\nthe moon. It traverses the 93,000,000 of miles which separate us from\r\nthe sun in about eight minutes. It travels from the sun out to Neptune\r\nin about four hours, which means that it would cross the solar system\r\nfrom end to end in eight. To pass, however, across the distance which\r\nseparates us from Alpha Centauri it would take so long as about four\r\nand a quarter years!\r\n\r\nAstronomers, therefore, agree in estimating the distances of the stars\r\nfrom the point of view of the time which light would take to pass from\r\nthem to our earth. They speak of that distance which light takes a year\r\nto traverse as a \"light year.\" According to this notation, Alpha\r\nCentauri is spoken of as being about four and a quarter light years\r\ndistant from us.\r\n\r\nNow as the rays of light coming from Alpha Centauri to us are chasing\r\none another incessantly across the gulf of space, and as each ray left\r\nthat star some four years before it reaches us, our view of the star\r\nitself must therefore be always some four years old. Were then this star\r\nto be suddenly removed from the universe at any moment, we should\r\ncontinue to see it still in its place in the sky for some four years\r\nmore, after which it would suddenly disappear. The rays which had\r\nalready started upon their journey towards our earth must indeed\r\ncontinue travelling, and reaching us in their turn until the last one\r\nhad arrived; after which no more would come.\r\n\r\nWe have drawn attention to Alpha Centauri as the nearest of the stars.\r\nThe majority of the others indeed are ever so much farther. We can only\r\nhazard a guess at the time it takes for the rays from many of them to\r\nreach our globe. Suppose, for instance, we see a sudden change in the\r\nlight of any of these remote stars, we are inclined to ask ourselves\r\nwhen that change did actually occur. Was it in the days of Queen\r\nElizabeth, or at the time of the Norman Conquest; or was it when Rome\r\nwas at the height of her glory, or perhaps ages before that when the\r\nPyramids of Egypt were being built? Even the last of these suppositions\r\ncannot be treated lightly. We have indeed no real knowledge of the\r\ndistance from us of those stars which our giant telescopes have brought\r\ninto view out of the depths of the celestial spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCELESTIAL MEASUREMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the telescope never been invented our knowledge of astronomy would\r\nbe trifling indeed.\r\n\r\nPrior to the year 1610, when Galileo first turned the new instrument\r\nupon the sky, all that men knew of the starry realms was gathered from\r\nobservation with their own eyes unaided by any artificial means. In such\r\nresearches they had been very much at a disadvantage. The sun and moon,\r\nin their opinion, were no doubt the largest bodies in the heavens, for\r\nthe mere reason that they looked so! The mighty solar disturbances,\r\nwhich are now such common-places to us, were then quite undreamed of.\r\nThe moon displayed a patchy surface, and that was all; her craters and\r\nring-mountains were surprises as yet in store for men. Nothing of course\r\nwas known about the surfaces of the planets. These objects had indeed no\r\nparticular characteristics to distinguish them from the great host of\r\nthe stars, except that they continually changed their positions in the\r\nsky while the rest did not. The stars themselves were considered as\r\nfixed inalterably upon the vault of heaven. The sun, moon, and planets\r\napparently moved about in the intermediate space, supported in their\r\ncourses by strange and fanciful devices. The idea of satellites was as\r\nyet unknown. Comets were regarded as celestial portents, and meteors as\r\nsmall conflagrations taking place in the upper air.\r\n\r\nIn the entire absence of any knowledge with regard to the actual sizes\r\nand distances of the various celestial bodies, men naturally considered\r\nthem as small; and, concluding that they were comparatively near,\r\nassigned to them in consequence a permanent connection with terrestrial\r\naffairs. Thus arose the quaint and erroneous beliefs of astrology,\r\naccording to which the events which took place upon our earth were\r\nconsidered to depend upon the various positions in which the planets,\r\nfor instance, found themselves from time to time.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be acknowledged that the study of astrology,\r\nfallacious though its conclusions were, indirectly performed a great\r\nservice to astronomy by reason of the accurate observations and diligent\r\nstudy of the stars which it entailed.\r\n\r\nWe will now inquire into the means by which the distances and sizes of\r\nthe celestial orbs have been ascertained, and see how it was that the\r\nancients were so entirely in the dark in this matter.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct methods of finding out the distance at which any\r\nobject happens to be situated from us.\r\n\r\nOne method is by actual measurement.\r\n\r\nThe other is by moving oneself a little to the right or left, and\r\nobserving whether the distant object appears in any degree altered in\r\nposition by our own change of place.\r\n\r\nOne of the best illustrations of this relative change of position which\r\nobjects undergo as a result of our own change of place, is to observe\r\nthe landscape from the window of a moving railway carriage. As we are\r\nborne rapidly along we notice that the telegraph posts which are set\r\nclose to the line appear to fly past us in the contrary direction; the\r\ntrees, houses, and other things beyond go by too, but not so fast;\r\nobjects a good way off displace slowly; while some spire, or tall\r\nlandmark, in the far distance appears to remain unmoved during a\r\ncomparatively long time.\r\n\r\nActual change of position on our own part is found indeed to be\r\ninvariably accompanied by an apparent displacement of the objects about\r\nus, such apparent displacement as a result of our own change of position\r\nbeing known as \"parallax.\" The dependence between the two is so\r\nmathematically exact, that if we know the amount of our own change of\r\nplace, and if we observe the amount of the consequent displacement of\r\nany object, we are enabled to calculate its precise distance from us.\r\nThus it comes to pass that distances can be measured without the\r\nnecessity of moving over them; and the breadth of a river, for instance,\r\nor the distance from us of a ship at sea, can be found merely by such\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nIt is by the application of this principle to the wider field of the sky\r\nthat we are able to ascertain the distance of celestial bodies. We have\r\nnoted that it requires a goodly change of place on our own part to shift\r\nthe position in which some object in the far distance is seen by us. To\r\ntwo persons separated by, say, a few hundred yards, a ship upon the\r\nhorizon will appear pretty much in the same direction. They would\r\nrequire, in fact, to be much farther apart in order to displace it\r\nsufficiently for the purpose of estimating their distance from it. It\r\nis the same with regard to the moon. Two observers, standing upon our\r\nearth, will require to be some thousands of miles apart in order to see\r\nthe position of our satellite sufficiently altered with regard to the\r\nstarry background, to give the necessary data upon which to ground their\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nThe change of position thus offered by one side of the earth's surface\r\nat a time is, however, not sufficient to displace any but the nearest\r\ncelestial bodies. When we have occasion to go farther afield we have to\r\nseek a greater change of place. This we can get as a consequence of the\r\nearth's movement around the sun. Observations, taken several days apart,\r\nwill show the effect of the earth's change of place during the interval\r\nupon the positions of the other bodies of our system. But when we desire\r\nto sound the depths of space beyond, and to reach out to measure the\r\ndistance of the nearest star, we find ourselves at once thrown upon the\r\ngreatest change of place which we can possibly hope for; and this we get\r\nduring the long journey of many millions of miles which our earth\r\nperforms around the sun during the course of each year. But even this\r\nlast change of place, great as it seems in comparison with terrestrial\r\nmeasurements, is insufficient to show anything more than the tiniest\r\ndisplacements in a paltry forty-three out of the entire host of the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nWe can thus realise at what a disadvantage the ancients were. The\r\nmeasuring instruments at their command were utterly inadequate to detect\r\nsuch small displacements. It was reserved for the telescope to reveal\r\nthem; and even then it required the great telescopes of recent times to\r\nshow the slight changes in the position of the nearer stars, which were\r\ncaused by the earth's being at one time at one end of its orbit, and\r\nsome six months later at the other end--stations separated from each\r\nother by a gulf of about one hundred and eighty-six millions of miles.\r\n\r\nThe actual distances of certain celestial bodies being thus\r\nascertainable, it becomes a matter of no great difficulty to determine\r\nthe actual sizes of the measurable ones. It is a matter of everyday\r\nexperience that the size which any object appears to have, depends\r\nexactly upon the distance it is from us. The farther off it is the\r\nsmaller it looks; the nearer it is the bigger. If, then, an object which\r\nlies at a known distance from us looks such and such a size, we can of\r\ncourse ascertain its real dimensions. Take the moon, for instance. As we\r\nhave already shown, we are able to ascertain its distance. We observe\r\nalso that it looks a certain size. It is therefore only a matter of\r\ncalculation to find what its actual dimensions should be, in order that\r\nit may look that size at that distance away. Similarly we can ascertain\r\nthe real dimensions of the sun. The planets, appearing to us as points\r\nof light, seem at first to offer a difficulty; but, by means of the\r\ntelescope, we can bring them, as it were, so much nearer to us, that\r\ntheir broad expanses may be seen. We fail, however, signally with regard\r\nto the stars; for they are so very distant, and therefore such tiny\r\npoints of light, that our mightiest telescopes cannot magnify them\r\nsufficiently to show any breadth of surface.\r\n\r\nInstead of saying that an object looks a certain breadth across, such\r\nas a yard or a foot, a statement which would really mean nothing,\r\nastronomers speak of it as measuring a certain angle. Such angles are\r\nestimated in what are called \"degrees of arc\"; each degree being divided\r\ninto sixty minutes, and each minute again into sixty seconds. Popularly\r\nconsidered the moon and sun _look_ about the same size, or, as an\r\nastronomer would put it, they measure about the same angle. This is an\r\nangle, roughly, of thirty-two minutes of arc; that is to say, slightly\r\nmore than half a degree. The broad expanse of surface which a celestial\r\nbody shows to us, whether to the naked eye, as in the case of the sun\r\nand moon, or in the telescope, as in the case of other members of our\r\nsystem, is technically known as its \"disc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nECLIPSES AND KINDRED PHENOMENA\r\n\r\n\r\nSince some members of the solar system are nearer to us than others, and\r\nall are again much nearer than any of the stars, it must often happen\r\nthat one celestial body will pass between us and another, and thus\r\nintercept its light for a while. The moon, being the nearest object in\r\nthe universe, will, of course, during its motion across the sky,\r\ntemporarily blot out every one of the others which happen to lie in its\r\npath. When it passes in this manner across the face of the sun, it is\r\nsaid to _eclipse_ it. When it thus hides a planet or star, it is said to\r\n_occult_ it. The reason why a separate term is used for what is merely a\r\ncase of obscuring light in exactly the same way, will be plain when one\r\nconsiders that the disc of the sun is almost of the same apparent size\r\nas that of the moon, and so the complete hiding of the sun can last but\r\na few minutes at the most; whereas a planet or a star looks so very\r\nsmall in comparison, that it is always _entirely swallowed up for some\r\ntime_ when it passes behind the body of our satellite.\r\n\r\nThe sun, of course, occults planets and stars in exactly the same manner\r\nas the moon does, but we cannot see these occultations on account of the\r\nblaze of sunlight.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the small size which the planets look when viewed with the\r\nnaked eye, we are not able to note them in the act of passing over stars\r\nand so blotting them out; but such occurrences may be seen in the\r\ntelescope, for the planetary bodies then display broad discs.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another occurrence of the same class which is known as a\r\n_transit_. This takes place when an apparently small body passes across\r\nthe face of an apparently large one, the phenomenon being in fact the\r\nexact reverse of an occultation. As there is no appreciable body nearer\r\nto us than the moon, we can never see anything in transit across her\r\ndisc. But since the planets Venus and Mercury are both nearer to us than\r\nthe sun, they will occasionally be seen to pass across his face, and\r\nthus we get the well-known phenomena called Transits of Venus and\r\nTransits of Mercury.\r\n\r\nAs the satellites of Jupiter are continually revolving around him, they\r\nwill often pass behind or across his disc. Such occultations and\r\ntransits of satellites can be well observed in the telescope.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a way in which the light of a celestial body may be\r\nobscured without the necessity of its being hidden from us by one\r\nnearer. It will no doubt be granted that any opaque object casts a\r\nshadow when a strong light falls directly upon it. Thus the earth, under\r\nthe powerful light which is directed upon it from the sun, casts an\r\nextensive shadow, though we are not aware of the existence of this\r\nshadow until it falls upon something. The shadow which the earth casts\r\nis indeed not noticeable to us until some celestial body passes into it.\r\nAs the sun is very large, and the earth in comparison very small, the\r\nshadow thrown by the earth is comparatively short, and reaches out in\r\nspace for only about a million miles. There is no visible object except\r\nthe moon, which circulates within that distance from our globe, and\r\ntherefore she is the only body which can pass into this shadow. Whenever\r\nsuch a thing happens, her surface at once becomes dark, for the reason\r\nthat she never emits any light of her own, but merely reflects that of\r\nthe sun. As the moon is continually revolving around the earth, one\r\nwould be inclined to imagine that once in every month, namely at what is\r\ncalled _full moon_, when she is on the other side of the earth with\r\nrespect to the sun, she ought to pass through the shadow in question.\r\nBut this does not occur every time, because the moon's orbit is not\r\nquite _upon the same plane_ with the earth's. It thus happens that time\r\nafter time the moon passes clear of the earth's shadow, sometimes above\r\nit, and sometimes below it. It is indeed only at intervals of about six\r\nmonths that the moon can be thus obscured. This darkening of her light\r\nis known as an _eclipse of the moon_. It seems a great pity that custom\r\nshould oblige us to employ the one term \"eclipse\" for this and also for\r\nthe quite different occurrence, an eclipse of the sun; in which the\r\nsun's face is hidden as a consequence of the moon's body coming directly\r\n_between_ it and our eyes.\r\n\r\nThe popular mind seems always to have found it more difficult to grasp\r\nthe causes of an eclipse of the moon than an eclipse of the sun. As Mr.\r\nJ.E. Gore[4] puts it: \"The darkening of the sun's light by the\r\ninterposition of the moon's body seems more obvious than the passing of\r\nthe moon through the earth's shadow.\"\r\n\r\nEclipses of the moon furnish striking spectacles, but really add little\r\nto our knowledge. They exhibit, however, one of the most remarkable\r\nevidences of the globular shape of our earth; for the outline of its\r\nshadow when seen creeping over the moon's surface is always circular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Total and Partial Eclipses of the Moon. The Moon\r\nis here shown in two positions; i.e. _entirely_ plunged in the earth's\r\nshadow and therefore totally eclipsed, and only _partly_ plunged in it\r\nor partially eclipsed.]\r\n\r\n_Eclipses of the Moon_, or Lunar Eclipses, as they are also called, are\r\nof two kinds--_Total_, and _Partial_. In a total lunar eclipse the moon\r\npasses entirely into the earth's shadow, and the whole of her surface is\r\nconsequently darkened. This darkening lasts for about two hours. In a\r\npartial lunar eclipse, a portion only of the moon passes through the\r\nshadow, and so only _part_ of her surface is darkened (see Fig. 3). A\r\nvery striking phenomenon during a total eclipse of the moon, is that the\r\ndarkening of the lunar surface is usually by no means so intense as one\r\nwould expect, when one considers that the sunlight at that time should\r\nbe _wholly_ cut off from it. The occasions indeed upon which the moon\r\nhas completely disappeared from view during the progress of a total\r\nlunar eclipse are very rare. On the majority of these occasions she has\r\nappeared of a coppery-red colour, while sometimes she has assumed an\r\nashen hue. The explanations of these variations of colour is to be found\r\nin the then state of the atmosphere which surrounds our earth. When\r\nthose portions of our earth's atmosphere through which the sun's rays\r\nhave to filter on their way towards the moon are free from watery\r\nvapour, the lunar surface will be tinged with a reddish light, such as\r\nwe ordinarily experience at sunset when our air is dry. The ashen colour\r\nis the result of our atmosphere being laden with watery vapour, and is\r\nsimilar to what we see at sunset when rain is about. Lastly, when the\r\nair around the earth is thickly charged with cloud, no light at all can\r\npass; and on such occasions the moon disappears altogether for the time\r\nbeing from the night sky.\r\n\r\n_Eclipses of the Sun_, otherwise known as Solar Eclipses, are divided\r\ninto _Total_, _Partial_, and _Annular_. A total eclipse of the sun takes\r\nplace when the moon comes between the sun and the earth, in such a\r\nmanner that it cuts off the sunlight _entirely_ for the time being from\r\na _portion_ of the earth's surface. A person situated in the region in\r\nquestion will, therefore, at that moment find the sun temporarily\r\nblotted out from his view by the body of the moon. Since the moon is a\r\nvery much smaller body than the sun, and also very much the nearer to us\r\nof the two, it will readily be understood that the portion of the earth\r\nfrom which the sun is seen thus totally eclipsed will be of small\r\nextent. In places not very distant from this region, the moon will\r\nappear so much shifted in the sky that the sun will be seen only\r\npartially eclipsed. The moon being in constant movement round the earth,\r\nthe portion of the earth's surface from which an eclipse is seen as\r\ntotal will be always a comparatively narrow band lying roughly from west\r\nto east. This band, known as the _track of totality_, can, at the\r\nutmost, never be more than about 165 miles in width, and as a rule is\r\nvery much less. For about 2000 miles on either side of it the sun is\r\nseen partially eclipsed. Outside these limits no eclipse of any kind is\r\nvisible, as from such regions the moon is not seen to come in the way of\r\nthe sun (see Fig. 4 (i.), p. 67).\r\n\r\nIt may occur to the reader that eclipses can also take place in the\r\ncourse of which the positions, where the eclipse would ordinarily be\r\nseen as total, will lie outside the surface of the earth. Such an\r\neclipse is thus not dignified with the name of total eclipse, but is\r\ncalled a partial eclipse, because from the earth's surface the sun is\r\nonly seen _partly eclipsed at the utmost_ (see Fig. 4 (ii.), p. 67).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (i.) Total Eclipse of the Sun.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (ii.) Partial Eclipse of the Sun.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.--Total and Partial Eclipses of the Sun. From the position A the\r\nSun cannot be seen, as it is entirely blotted out by the Moon. From B it\r\nis seen partially blotted out, because the Moon is to a certain degree\r\nin the way. From C no eclipse is seen, because the Moon does not come in\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that in a Partial Eclipse of the Sun, the position A\r\nlies _outside_ the surface of the Earth.]\r\n\r\nAn _Annular eclipse_ is an eclipse which just fails to become total for\r\nyet another reason. We have pointed out that the orbits of the various\r\nmembers of the solar system are not circular, but oval. Such oval\r\nfigures, it will be remembered, are technically known as ellipses. In an\r\nelliptic orbit the controlling body is situated not in the middle of the\r\nfigure, but rather towards one of the ends; the actual point which it\r\noccupies being known as the _focus_. The sun being at the focus of the\r\nearth's orbit, it follows that the earth is, at times, a little nearer\r\nto him than at others. The sun will therefore appear to us to vary a\r\nlittle in size, looking sometimes slightly larger than at other times.\r\nIt is so, too, with the moon, at the focus of whose orbit the earth is\r\nsituated. She therefore also appears to us at times to vary slightly in\r\nsize. The result is that when the sun is eclipsed by the moon, and the\r\nmoon at the time appears the larger of the two, she is able to blot out\r\nthe sun completely, and so we can get a total eclipse. But when, on the\r\nother hand, the sun appears the larger, the eclipse will not be quite\r\ntotal, for a portion of the sun's disc will be seen protruding all\r\naround the moon like a ring of light. This is what is known as an\r\nannular eclipse, from the Latin word _annulus_, which means a ring. The\r\nterm is consecrated by long usage, but it seems an unfortunate one on\r\naccount of its similarity to the word \"annual.\" The Germans speak of\r\nthis kind of eclipse as \"ring-formed,\" which is certainly much more to\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\nThere can never be a year without an eclipse of the sun. Indeed there\r\nmust be always two such eclipses _at least_ during that period, though\r\nthere need be no eclipse of the moon at all. On the other hand, the\r\ngreatest number of eclipses which can ever take place during a year are\r\nseven; that is to say, either five solar eclipses and two lunar, or four\r\nsolar and three lunar. This general statement refers merely to eclipses\r\nin their broadest significance, and informs us in no way whether they\r\nwill be total or partial.\r\n\r\nOf all the phenomena which arise from the hiding of any celestial body\r\nby one nearer coming in the way, a total eclipse of the sun is far the\r\nmost important. It is, indeed, interesting to consider how much poorer\r\nmodern astronomy would be but for the extraordinary coincidence which\r\nmakes a total solar eclipse just possible. The sun is about 400 times\r\nfarther off from us than the moon, and enormously greater than her in\r\nbulk. Yet the two are relatively so distanced from us as to look about\r\nthe same size. The result of this is that the moon, as has been seen,\r\ncan often blot out the sun entirely from our view for a short time. When\r\nthis takes place the great blaze of sunlight which ordinarily dazzles\r\nour eyes is completely cut off, and we are thus enabled, unimpeded, to\r\nnote what is going on in the immediate vicinity of the sun itself.\r\n\r\nIn a total solar eclipse, the time which elapses from the moment when\r\nthe moon's disc first begins to impinge upon that of the sun at his\r\nwestern edge until the eclipse becomes total, lasts about an hour.\r\nDuring all this time the black lunar disc may be watched making its way\r\nsteadily across the solar face. Notwithstanding the gradual obscuration\r\nof the sun, one does not notice much diminution of light until about\r\nthree-quarters of his disc are covered. Then a wan, unearthly appearance\r\nbegins to pervade all things, the temperature falls noticeably, and\r\nnature seems to halt in expectation of the coming of something unusual.\r\nThe decreasing portion of sun becomes more and more narrow, until at\r\nlength it is reduced to a crescent-shaped strip of exceeding fineness.\r\nStrange, ill-defined, flickering shadows (known as \"Shadow Bands\") may\r\nat this moment be seen chasing each other across any white expanse such\r\nas a wall, a building, or a sheet stretched upon the ground. The western\r\nside of the sky has now assumed an appearance dark and lowering, as if a\r\nrainstorm of great violence were approaching. This is caused by the\r\nmighty mass of the lunar shadow sweeping rapidly along. It flies onward\r\nat the terrific velocity of about half a mile a second.\r\n\r\nIf the gradually diminishing crescent of sun be now watched through a\r\ntelescope, the observer will notice that it does not eventually vanish\r\nall at once, as he might have expected. Rather, it breaks up first of\r\nall along its length into a series of brilliant dots, known as \"Baily's\r\nBeads.\" The reason of this phenomenon is perhaps not entirely agreed\r\nupon, but the majority of astronomers incline to the opinion that the\r\nso-called \"beads\" are merely the last remnants of sunlight peeping\r\nbetween those lunar mountain peaks which happen at the moment to fringe\r\nthe advancing edge of the moon. The beads are no sooner formed than they\r\nrapidly disappear one after the other, after which no portion of the\r\nsolar surface is left to view, and the eclipse is now total (see Fig.\r\n5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _In a total Eclipse_ _In an annular Eclipse_\r\n\r\nFIG. 5.--\"Baily's Beads.\"]\r\n\r\nBut with the disappearance of the sun there springs into view a new and\r\nstrange appearance, ordinarily unseen because of the blaze of sunlight.\r\nIt is a kind of aureole, or halo, pearly white in colour, which is seen\r\nto surround the black disc of the moon. This white radiance is none\r\nother than the celebrated phenomenon widely known as the _Solar Corona_.\r\nIt was once upon a time thought to belong to the moon, and to be perhaps\r\na lunar atmosphere illuminated by the sunlight shining through it from\r\nbehind. But the suddenness with which the moon always blots out stars\r\nwhen occulting them, has amply proved that she possesses no atmosphere\r\nworth speaking about. It is now, however, satisfactorily determined that\r\nthe corona belongs to the sun, for during the short time that it remains\r\nin view the black body of the moon can be seen creeping across it.\r\n\r\nAll the time that the _total phase_ (as it is called) lasts, the corona\r\nglows with its pale unearthly light, shedding upon the earth's surface\r\nan illumination somewhat akin to full moonlight. Usually the planet\r\nVenus and a few stars shine out the while in the darkened heaven.\r\nMeantime around the observer animal and plant life behave as at\r\nnightfall. Birds go to roost, bats fly out, worms come to the surface of\r\nthe ground, flowers close up. In the Norwegian eclipse of 1896 fish were\r\nseen rising to the surface of the water. When the total phase at length\r\nis over, and the moon in her progress across the sky has allowed the\r\nbrilliant disc of the sun to spring into view once more at the other\r\nside, the corona disappears.\r\n\r\nThere is another famous accompaniment of the sun which partly reveals\r\nitself during total solar eclipses. This is a layer of red flame which\r\nclosely envelops the body of the sun and lies between it and the corona.\r\nThis layer is known by the name of the _Chromosphere_. Just as at\r\nordinary times we cannot see the corona on account of the blaze of\r\nsunlight, so are we likewise unable to see the chromosphere because of\r\nthe dazzling white light which shines through from the body of the sun\r\nunderneath and completely overpowers it. When, however, during a solar\r\neclipse, the lunar disc has entirely hidden the brilliant face of the\r\nsun, we are still able for a few moments to see an edgewise portion of\r\nthe chromosphere in the form of a narrow red strip, fringing the\r\nadvancing border of the moon. Later on, just before the moon begins to\r\nuncover the face of the sun from the other side, we may again get a view\r\nof a strip of chromosphere.\r\n\r\nThe outer surface of the chromosphere is not by any means even. It is\r\nrough and billowy, like the surface of a storm-tossed sea. Portions of\r\nit, indeed, rise at times to such heights that they may be seen standing\r\nout like blood-red points around the black disc of the moon, and remain\r\nthus during a good part of the total phase. These projections are known\r\nas the _Solar Prominences_. In the same way as the corona, the\r\nchromosphere and prominences were for a time supposed to belong to the\r\nmoon. This, however, was soon found not to be the case, for the lunar\r\ndisc was noticed to creep slowly across them also.\r\n\r\nThe total phase, or \"totality,\" as it is also called, lasts for\r\ndifferent lengths of time in different eclipses. It is usually of about\r\ntwo or three minutes' duration, and at the utmost it can never last\r\nlonger than about eight minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen totality is over and the corona has faded away, the moon's disc\r\ncreeps little by little from the face of the sun, light and heat returns\r\nonce more to the earth, and nature recovers gradually from the gloom in\r\nwhich she has been plunged. About an hour after totality, the last\r\nremnant of moon draws away from the solar disc, and the eclipse is\r\nentirely at an end.\r\n\r\nThe corona, the chromosphere, and the prominences are the most important\r\nof these accompaniments of the sun which a total eclipse reveals to us.\r\nOur further consideration of them must, however, be reserved for a\r\nsubsequent chapter, in which the sun will be treated of at length.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has had the good fortune to see a total eclipse of the sun\r\nwill, the writer feels sure, agree with the verdict of Sir Norman\r\nLockyer that it is at once one of the \"grandest and most awe-inspiring\r\nsights\" which man can witness. Needless to say, such an occurrence used\r\nto cause great consternation in less civilised ages; and that it has not\r\nin modern times quite parted with its terrors for some persons, is shown\r\nby the fact that in Iowa, in the United States, a woman died from fright\r\nduring the eclipse of 1869.\r\n\r\nTo the serious observer of a total solar eclipse every instant is\r\nextremely precious. Many distinct observations have to be crowded into a\r\ntime all too limited, and this in an eclipse-party necessitates constant\r\nrehearsals in order that not a moment may be wasted when the longed-for\r\ntotality arrives. Such preparation is very necessary; for the rarity and\r\nuncommon nature of a total eclipse of the sun, coupled with its\r\nexceeding short duration, tends to flurry the mind, and to render it\r\nslow to seize upon salient points of detail. And, even after every\r\nprecaution has been taken, weather possibilities remain to be reckoned\r\nwith, so that success is rather a lottery.\r\n\r\nAbove all things, therefore, a total solar eclipse is an occurrence for\r\nthe proper utilisation of which personal experience is of absolute\r\nnecessity. It was manifestly out of the question that such experience\r\ncould be gained by any individual in early times, as the imperfection\r\nof astronomical theory and geographical knowledge rendered the\r\npredicting of the exact position of the track of totality well-nigh\r\nimpossible. Thus chance alone would have enabled one in those days to\r\nwitness a total phase, and the probabilities, of course, were much\r\nagainst a second such experience in the span of a life-time. And even in\r\nmore modern times, when the celestial motions had come to be better\r\nunderstood, the difficulties of foreign travel still were in the way;\r\nfor it is, indeed, a notable fact that during many years following the\r\ninvention of the telescope the tracks were placed for the most part in\r\nfar-off regions of the earth, and Europe was visited by singularly few\r\ntotal solar eclipses. Thus it came to pass that the building up of a\r\nbody of organised knowledge upon this subject was greatly delayed.\r\n\r\nNothing perhaps better shows the soundness of modern astronomical theory\r\nthan the almost exact agreement of the time predicted for an eclipse\r\nwith its actual occurrence. Similarly, by calculating backwards,\r\nastronomers have discovered the times and seasons at which many ancient\r\neclipses took place, and valuable opportunities have thus arisen for\r\nchecking certain disputed dates in history.\r\n\r\nIt should not be omitted here that the ancients were actually able, _in\r\na rough way_, to predict eclipses. The Chaldean astronomers had indeed\r\nnoticed very early a curious circumstance, _i.e._ that eclipses tend to\r\nrepeat themselves after a lapse of slightly more than eighteen years.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it must, however, be pointed out, in the first\r\ninstance, that the eclipses which occur in any particular year are in\r\nno way associated with those which occurred in the previous year. In\r\nother words, the mere fact that an eclipse takes place upon a certain\r\nday this year will not bring about a repetition of it at the same time\r\nnext year. However, the nicely balanced behaviour of the solar system,\r\nan equilibrium resulting from æons of orbital ebb and flow, naturally\r\ntends to make the members which compose that family repeat their ancient\r\ncombinations again and again; so that after definite lapses of time the\r\nsame order of things will _almost exactly_ recur. Thus, as a consequence\r\nof their beautifully poised motions, the sun, the moon, and the earth\r\ntend, after a period of 18 years and 10-1/3 days,[5] to occupy very\r\nnearly the same positions with regard to each other. The result of this\r\nis that, during each recurring period, the eclipses comprised within it\r\nwill be repeated in their order.\r\n\r\nTo give examples:--\r\n\r\nThe total solar eclipse of August 30, 1905, was a repetition of that of\r\nAugust 19, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe partial solar eclipse of February 23, 1906, corresponded to that\r\nwhich took place on February 11, 1888.\r\n\r\nThe annular eclipse of July 10, 1907, was a recurrence of that of June\r\n28, 1889.\r\n\r\nIn this way we can go on until the eighteen year cycle has run out, and\r\nwe come upon a total solar eclipse predicted for September 10, 1923,\r\nwhich will repeat the above-mentioned ones of 1905 and 1887; and so on\r\ntoo with the others.\r\n\r\nFrom mere observation alone, extending no doubt over many ages, those\r\ntime-honoured watchers of the sky, the early Chaldeans, had arrived at\r\nthis remarkable generalisation; and they used it for the rough\r\nprediction of eclipses. To the period of recurrence they give the name\r\nof \"Saros.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here we find ourselves led into one of the most interesting and\r\nfascinating by-paths in astronomy, to which writers, as a rule, pay all\r\ntoo little heed.\r\n\r\nIn order not to complicate matters unduly, the recurrence of solar\r\neclipses alone will first be dealt with. This limitation will, however,\r\nnot affect the arguments in the slightest, and it will be all the more\r\neasy in consequence to show their application to the case of eclipses of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps have noticed that, with regard to the repetition\r\nof an eclipse, it has been stated that the conditions which bring it on\r\nat each recurrence are reproduced _almost exactly_. Here, then, lies the\r\n_crux_ of the situation. For it is quite evident that were the\r\nconditions _exactly_ reproduced, the recurrences of each eclipse would\r\ngo on for an indefinite period. For instance, if the lapse of a saros\r\nperiod found the sun, moon, and earth again in the precise relative\r\nsituations which they had previously occupied, the recurrences of a\r\nsolar eclipse would tend to duplicate its forerunner with regard to the\r\nposition of the shadow upon the terrestrial surface. But the conditions\r\n_not_ being exactly reproduced, the shadow-track does not pass across\r\nthe earth in quite the same regions. It is shifted a little, so to\r\nspeak; and each time the eclipse comes round it is found to be shifted a\r\nlittle farther. Every solar eclipse has therefore a definite \"life\" of\r\nits own upon the earth, lasting about 1150 years, or 64 saros returns,\r\nand working its way little by little across our globe from north to\r\nsouth, or from south to north, as the case may be. Let us take an\r\nimaginary example. A _partial_ eclipse occurs, say, somewhere near the\r\nNorth Pole, the edge of the \"partial\" shadow just grazing the earth, and\r\nthe \"track of totality\" being as yet cast into space. Here we have the\r\nbeginning of a series. At each saros recurrence the partial shadow\r\nencroaches upon a greater extent of earth-surface. At length, in its\r\nturn, the track of totality begins to impinge upon the earth. This track\r\nstreaks across our globe at each return of the eclipse, repeating itself\r\nevery time in a slightly more southerly latitude. South and south it\r\nmoves, passing in turn the Tropic of Cancer, the Equator, the Tropic of\r\nCapricorn, until it reaches the South Pole; after which it touches the\r\nearth no longer, but is cast into space. The rear portion of the partial\r\nshadow, in its turn, grows less and less in extent; and it too in time\r\nfinally passes off. Our imaginary eclipse series is now no more--its\r\n\"life\" has ended.\r\n\r\nWe have taken, as an example, an eclipse series moving from north to\r\nsouth. We might have taken one moving from south to north, for they\r\nprogress in either direction.\r\n\r\nFrom the description just given the reader might suppose that, if the\r\ntracks of totality of an eclipse series were plotted upon a chart of the\r\nworld, they would lie one beneath another like a set of steps. This is,\r\nhowever, _not_ the case, and the reason is easily found. It depends upon\r\nthe fact that the saros does not comprise an exact number of days, but\r\nincludes, as we have seen, one-third of a day in addition.\r\n\r\nIt will be granted, of course, that if the number of days was exact, the\r\n_same_ parts of the earth would always be brought round by the axial\r\nrotation _to front the sun_ at the moment of the recurrence of the\r\neclipse. But as there is still one-third of a day to complete the saros\r\nperiod, the earth has yet to make one-third of a rotation upon its axis\r\nbefore the eclipse takes place. Thus at every recurrence the track of\r\ntotality finds itself placed one-third of the earth's circumference to\r\nthe _westward_. Three of the recurrences will, of course, complete the\r\ncircuit of the globe; and so the fourth recurrence will duplicate the\r\none which preceded it, three saros returns, or 54 years and 1 month\r\nbefore. This duplication, as we have already seen, will, however, be\r\nsituated in a latitude to the south or north of its predecessor,\r\naccording as the eclipse series is progressing in a southerly or\r\nnortherly direction.\r\n\r\nLastly, every eclipse series, after working its way across the earth,\r\nwill return again to go through the same process after some 12,000\r\nyears; so that, at the end of that great lapse of time, the entire\r\n\"life\" of every eclipse should repeat itself, provided that the\r\nconditions of the solar system have not altered appreciably during the\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to consider this gradual southerly or\r\nnortherly progress of eclipse recurrences in its application to the case\r\nof eclipses of the moon. It should be evident that, just as in solar\r\neclipses the lunar shadow is lowered or raised (as the case may be) each\r\ntime it strikes the terrestrial surface, so in lunar eclipses will the\r\nbody of the moon shift its place at each recurrence relatively to the\r\nposition of the earth's shadow. Every lunar eclipse, therefore, will\r\ncommence on our satellite's disc as a partial eclipse at the northern or\r\nsouthern extremity, as the case may be. Let us take, as an example, an\r\nimaginary series of eclipses of the moon progressing from north to\r\nsouth. At each recurrence the partial phase will grow greater, its\r\nboundary encroaching more and more to the southward, until eventually\r\nthe whole disc is enveloped by the shadow, and the eclipse becomes\r\ntotal. It will then repeat itself as total during a number of\r\nrecurrences, until the entire breadth of the shadow has been passed\r\nthrough, and the northern edge of the moon at length springs out into\r\nsunlight. This illuminated portion will grow more and more extensive at\r\neach succeeding return, the edge of the shadow appearing to recede from\r\nit until it finally passes off at the south. Similarly, when a lunar\r\neclipse commences as partial at the south of the moon, the edge of the\r\nshadow at each subsequent recurrence finds itself more and more to the\r\nnorthward. In due course the total phase will supervene, and will\r\npersist during a number of recurrences until the southerly trend of the\r\nmoon results in the uncovering of the lunar surface at the south. Thus,\r\nas the boundary of the shadow is left more and more to the northward,\r\nthe illuminated portion on the southern side of the moon becomes at each\r\nrecurrence greater and the darkened portion on the northern side less,\r\nuntil the shadow eventually passes off at the north.\r\n\r\nThe \"life\" of an eclipse of the moon happens, for certain reasons, to be\r\nmuch shorter than that of an eclipse of the sun. It lasts during only\r\nabout 860 years, or 48 saros returns.\r\n\r\nFig. 6, p. 81, is a map of the world on Mercator's Projection, showing a\r\nportion of the march of the total solar eclipse of August 30, 1905,\r\nacross the surface of the earth. The projection in question has been\r\nemployed because it is the one with which people are most familiar. This\r\neclipse began by striking the neighbourhood of the North Pole in the\r\nguise of a partial eclipse during the latter part of the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, and became total on the earth for the first time on the 24th\r\nof June 1797. Its next appearance was on the 6th of July 1815. It has\r\nnot been possible to show the tracks of totality of these two early\r\nvisitations on account of the distortion of the polar regions consequent\r\non the _fiction_ of Mercator's Projection. It is therefore made to\r\ncommence with the track of its third appearance, viz. on July 17, 1833.\r\nIn consequence of those variations in the apparent sizes of the sun and\r\nmoon, which result, as we have seen, from the variations in their\r\ndistances from the earth, this eclipse will change from a total into an\r\nannular eclipse towards the end of the twenty-first century. By that\r\ntime the track will have passed to the southern side of the equator. The\r\ntrack will eventually leave the earth near the South Pole about the\r\nbeginning of the twenty-sixth century, and the rear portion of the\r\npartial shadow will in its turn be clear of the terrestrial surface by\r\nabout 2700 A.D., when the series comes to an end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Map of the World on Mercator's Projection,\r\nshowing a portion of the progress of the Total Solar Eclipse of August\r\n30, 1905, across the surface of the earth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] Astronomical Essays (p. 40), London, 1907.\r\n\r\n[5] In some cases the periods between the dates of the corresponding\r\neclipses _appear_ to include a greater number of days than ten; but this\r\nis easily explained when allowance is made for intervening _leap_ years\r\n(in each of which an _extra_ day has of course been added), and also for\r\nvariations in local time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFAMOUS ECLIPSES OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is thought to be the earliest reference to an eclipse comes down to\r\nus from the ancient Chinese records, and is over four thousand years\r\nold. The eclipse in question was a solar one, and occurred, so far as\r\ncan be ascertained, during the twenty-second century B.C. The story runs\r\nthat the two state astronomers, Ho and Hi by name, being exceedingly\r\nintoxicated, were unable to perform their required duties, which\r\nconsisted in superintending the customary rites of beating drums,\r\nshooting arrows, and the like, in order to frighten away the mighty\r\ndragon which it was believed was about to swallow up the Lord of Day.\r\nThis eclipse seems to have been only partial; nevertheless a great\r\nturmoil ensued, and the two astronomers were put to death, no doubt with\r\nthe usual _celestial_ cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe next eclipse mentioned in the Chinese annals is also a solar\r\neclipse, and appears to have taken place more than a thousand years\r\nlater, namely in 776 B.C. Records of similar eclipses follow from the\r\nsame source; but as they are mere notes of the events, and do not enter\r\ninto any detail, they are of little interest. Curiously enough the\r\nChinese have taken practically no notice of eclipses of the moon, but\r\nhave left us a comparatively careful record of comets, which has been\r\nof value to modern astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of a _total_ eclipse of the sun (for it should be\r\nnoted that the ancient Chinese eclipse above-mentioned was merely\r\npartial) was deciphered in 1905, on a very ancient Babylonian tablet, by\r\nMr. L.W. King of the British Museum. This eclipse took place in the year\r\n1063 B.C.\r\n\r\nAssyrian tablets record three solar eclipses which occurred between\r\nthree and four hundred years later than this. The first of these was in\r\n763 B.C.; the total phase being visible near Nineveh.\r\n\r\nThe next record of an eclipse of the sun comes to us from a Grecian\r\nsource. This eclipse took place in 585 B.C., and has been the subject of\r\nmuch investigation. Herodotus, to whom we are indebted for the account,\r\ntells us that it occurred during a battle in a war which had been waging\r\nfor some years between the Lydians and Medes. The sudden coming on of\r\ndarkness led to a termination of the contest, and peace was afterwards\r\nmade between the combatants. The historian goes on to state that the\r\neclipse had been foretold by Thales, who is looked upon as the Founder\r\nof Grecian astronomy. This eclipse is in consequence known as the\r\n\"Eclipse of Thales.\" It would seem as if that philosopher were\r\nacquainted with the Chaldean saros.\r\n\r\nThe next solar eclipse worthy of note was an annular one, and occurred\r\nin 431 B.C., the first year of the Peloponnesian War. Plutarch relates\r\nthat the pilot of the ship, which was about to convey Pericles to the\r\nPeloponnesus, was very much frightened by it; but Pericles calmed him by\r\nholding up a cloak before his eyes, and saying that the only difference\r\nbetween this and the eclipse was that something larger than the cloak\r\nprevented his seeing the sun for the time being.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of great historical interest is that known as the \"Eclipse of\r\nAgathocles,\" which occurred on the morning of the 15th of August, 310\r\nB.C. Agathocles, Tyrant of Syracuse, had been blockaded in the harbour\r\nof that town by the Carthaginian fleet, but effected the escape of his\r\nsquadron under cover of night, and sailed for Africa in order to invade\r\nthe enemy's territory. During the following day he and his vessels\r\nexperienced a total eclipse, in which \"day wholly put on the appearance\r\nof night, and the stars were seen in all parts of the sky.\"\r\n\r\nA few solar eclipses are supposed to be referred to in early Roman\r\nhistory, but their identity is very doubtful in comparison with those\r\nwhich the Greeks have recorded. Additional doubt is cast upon them by\r\nthe fact that they are usually associated with famous events. The birth\r\nand death of Romulus, and the Passage of the Rubicon by Julius Cæsar,\r\nare stated indeed to have been accompanied by these marks of the\r\napproval or disapproval of the gods!\r\n\r\nReference to our subject in the Bible is scanty. Amos viii. 9 is thought\r\nto refer to the Nineveh eclipse of 763 B.C., to which allusion has\r\nalready been made; while the famous episode of Hezekiah and the shadow\r\non the dial of Ahaz has been connected with an eclipse which was partial\r\nat Jerusalem in 689 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe first solar eclipse, recorded during the Christian Era, is known as\r\nthe \"Eclipse of Phlegon,\" from the fact that we are indebted for the\r\naccount to a pagan writer of that name. This eclipse took place in A.D.\r\n29, and the total phase was visible a little to the north of Palestine.\r\nIt has sometimes been confounded with the \"darkness of the Crucifixion,\"\r\nwhich event took place near the date in question; but it is sufficient\r\nhere to say that the Crucifixion is well known to have occurred during\r\nthe Passover of the Jews, which is always celebrated at the _full_ moon,\r\nwhereas an eclipse of the sun can only take place at _new_ moon.\r\n\r\nDion Cassius, commenting on the Emperor Claudius about the year A.D. 45,\r\nwrites as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"As there was going to be an eclipse on his birthday, through fear of a\r\ndisturbance, as there had been other prodigies, he put forth a public\r\nnotice, not only that the obscuration would take place, and about the\r\ntime and magnitude of it, but also about the causes that produce such an\r\nevent.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable piece of information; for the Romans, an\r\nessentially military nation, appear hitherto to have troubled themselves\r\nvery little about astronomical matters, and were content, as we have\r\nseen, to look upon phenomena, like eclipses, as mere celestial\r\nprodigies.\r\n\r\nWhat is thought to be the first definite mention of the solar corona\r\noccurs in a passage of Plutarch. The eclipse to which he refers is\r\nprobably one which took place in A.D. 71. He says that the obscuration\r\ncaused by the moon \"has no time to last and no extensiveness, but some\r\nlight shows itself round the sun's circumference, which does not allow\r\nthe darkness to become deep and complete.\" No further reference to this\r\nphenomenon occurs until near the end of the sixteenth century. It\r\nshould, however, be here mentioned that Mr. E.W. Maunder has pointed\r\nout the probability[6] that we have a very ancient symbolic\r\nrepresentation of the corona in the \"winged circle,\" \"winged disc,\" or\r\n\"ring with wings,\" as it is variously called, which appears so often\r\nupon Assyrian and Egyptian monuments, as the symbol of the Deity (Fig.\r\n7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--The \"Ring with Wings.\" The upper is the Assyrian\r\nform of the symbol, the lower the Egyptian. (From _Knowledge_.) Compare\r\nthe form of the corona on Plate VII. (B), p. 142.]\r\n\r\nThe first solar eclipse recorded to have been seen in England is that of\r\nA.D. 538, mention of which is found in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_. The\r\ntrack of totality did not, however, come near our islands, for only\r\ntwo-thirds of the sun's disc were eclipsed at London.\r\n\r\nIn 840 a great eclipse took place in Europe, which was total for more\r\nthan five minutes across what is now Bavaria. Terror at this eclipse is\r\nsaid to have hastened the death of Louis le Debonnaire, Emperor of the\r\nWest, who lay ill at Worms.\r\n\r\nIn 878--_temp._ King Alfred--an eclipse of the sun took place which was\r\ntotal at London. From this until 1715 no other eclipse was total at\r\nLondon itself; though this does not apply to other portions of England.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse, generally known as the \"Eclipse of Stiklastad,\" is said to\r\nhave taken place in 1030, during the sea-fight in which Olaf of Norway\r\nis supposed to have been slain. Longfellow, in his _Saga of King Olaf_,\r\nhas it that\r\n\r\n\"The Sun hung red\r\nAs a drop of blood,\"\r\n\r\nbut, as in the case of most poets, the dramatic value of an eclipse\r\nseems to have escaped his notice.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1140 there occurred a total eclipse of the sun, the last to\r\nbe visible in England for more than five centuries. Indeed there have\r\nbeen only two such since--namely, those of 1715 and 1724, to which we\r\nshall allude in due course. The eclipse of 1140 took place on the 20th\r\nMarch, and is thus referred to in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_:--\r\n\r\n\"In the Lent, the sun and the day darkened, about the noon-tide of the\r\nday, when men were eating, and they lighted candles to eat by. That was\r\nthe 13th day before the calends of April. Men were very much struck with\r\nwonder.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of the older historians speak of a \"fearful eclipse\" as having\r\ntaken place on the morning of the Battle of Crecy, 1346. Lingard, for\r\ninstance, in his _History of England_, has as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Never, perhaps, were preparations for battle made under circumstances\r\nso truly awful. On that very day the sun suffered a partial eclipse:\r\nbirds, in clouds, the precursors of a storm, flew screaming over the two\r\narmies, and the rain fell in torrents, accompanied by incessant thunder\r\nand lightning. About five in the afternoon the weather cleared up; the\r\nsun in full splendour darted his rays in the eyes of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nCalculations, however, show that no eclipse of the sun took place in\r\nEurope during that year. This error is found to have arisen from the\r\nmistranslation of an obsolete French word _esclistre_ (lightning), which\r\nis employed by Froissart in his description of the battle.\r\n\r\nIn 1598 an eclipse was total over Scotland and part of North Germany. It\r\nwas observed at Torgau by Jessenius, an Hungarian physician, who noticed\r\na bright light around the moon during the time of totality. This is said\r\nto be the first reference to the corona since that of Plutarch, to which\r\nwe have already drawn attention.\r\n\r\nMention of Scotland recalls the fact that an unusual number of eclipses\r\nhappen to have been visible in that country, and the occult bent natural\r\nto the Scottish character has traditionalised a few of them in such\r\nterms as the \"Black Hour\" (an eclipse of 1433), \"Black Saturday\" (the\r\neclipse of 1598 which has been alluded to above), and \"Mirk Monday\"\r\n(1652). The track of the last-named also passed over Carrickfergus in\r\nIreland, where it was observed by a certain Dr. Wybord, in whose account\r\nthe term \"corona\" is first employed. This eclipse is the last which has\r\nbeen total in Scotland, and it is calculated that there will not be\r\nanother eclipse seen as total there until the twenty-second century.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the sun which took place on May 30, 1612, is recorded as\r\nhaving been seen \"through a tube.\" This probably refers to the then\r\nrecent invention--the telescope.\r\n\r\nThe eclipses which we have been describing are chiefly interesting from\r\nan historical point of view. The old mystery and confusion to the\r\nbeholders seem to have lingered even into comparatively enlightened\r\ntimes, for we see how late it is before the corona attracts definite\r\nattention for the sake of itself alone.\r\n\r\nIt is not a far cry from notice of the corona to that of other\r\naccompaniments of a solar eclipse. Thus the eclipse of 1706, the total\r\nphase of which was visible in Switzerland, is of great interest; for it\r\nwas on this occasion that the famous red prominences seem first to have\r\nbeen noted. A certain Captain Stannyan observed this eclipse from Berne\r\nin Switzerland, and described it in a letter to Flamsteed, the then\r\nAstronomer Royal. He says the sun's \"getting out of his eclipse was\r\npreceded by a blood-red streak of light from its left limb, which\r\ncontinued not longer than six or seven seconds of time; then part of the\r\nSun's disc appeared all of a sudden, as bright as Venus was ever seen in\r\nthe night, nay brighter; and in that very instant gave a Light and\r\nShadow to things as strong as Moonlight uses to do.\" How little was then\r\nexpected of the sun is, however, shown by Flamsteed's words, when\r\ncommunicating this information to the Royal Society:--\r\n\r\n\"The Captain is the first man I ever heard of that took notice of a Red\r\nStreak of Light preceding the Emersion of the Sun's body from a total\r\nEclipse. And I take notice of it to you because it infers that _the Moon\r\nhas an atmosphere_; and its short continuance of only six or seven\r\nseconds of time, tells us that _its height is not more than the five or\r\nsix hundredth part of her diameter_.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a change has since come over the ideas of men! The sun has proved a\r\nveritable mine of discovery, while the moon has yielded up nothing new.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of 1715, the first total at London since that of 878, was\r\nobserved by the famous astronomer, Edmund Halley, from the rooms of the\r\nRoyal Society, then in Crane Court, Fleet Street. On this occasion both\r\nthe corona and a red projection were noted. Halley further makes\r\nallusion to that curious phenomenon, which later on became celebrated\r\nunder the name of \"Baily's beads.\" It was also on the occasion of this\r\neclipse that the _earliest recorded drawings of the corona_ were made.\r\nCambridge happened to be within the track of totality; and a certain\r\nProfessor Cotes of that University, who is responsible for one of the\r\ndrawings in question, forwarded them to Sir Isaac Newton together with a\r\nletter describing his observations.\r\n\r\nIn 1724 there occurred an eclipse, the total phase of which was visible\r\nfrom the south-west of England, but not from London. The weather was\r\nunfavourable, and the eclipse consequently appears to have been seen by\r\nonly one person, a certain Dr. Stukeley, who observed it from Haraden\r\nHill near Salisbury Plain. This is the last eclipse of which the total\r\nphase was seen in any part of England. The next will not be until June\r\n29, 1927, and will be visible along a line across North Wales and\r\nLancashire. The discs of the sun and moon will just then be almost of\r\nthe same apparent size, and so totality will be of extremely short\r\nduration; in fact only a few seconds. London itself will not see a\r\ntotality until the year 2151--a circumstance which need hardly distress\r\nany of us personally!\r\n\r\nIt is only from the early part of the nineteenth century that serious\r\nscientific attention to eclipses of the sun can be dated. An _annular_\r\neclipse, visible in 1836 in the south of Scotland, drew the careful\r\nnotice of Francis Baily of Jedburgh in Roxburghshire to that curious\r\nphenomenon which we have already described, and which has ever since\r\nbeen known by the name of \"Baily's beads.\" Spurred by his observation,\r\nthe leading astronomers of the day determined to pay particular\r\nattention to a total eclipse, which in the year 1842 was to be visible\r\nin the south of France and the north of Italy. The public interest\r\naroused on this occasion was also very great, for the region across\r\nwhich the track of totality was to pass was very populous, and inhabited\r\nby races of a high degree of culture.\r\n\r\nThis eclipse occurred on the morning of the 8th July, and from it may be\r\ndated that great enthusiasm with which total eclipses of the sun have\r\never since been received. Airy, our then Astronomer Royal, observed it\r\nfrom Turin; Arago, the celebrated director of the Paris Observatory,\r\nfrom Perpignan in the south of France; Francis Baily from Pavia; and Sir\r\nJohn Herschel from Milan. The corona and three large red prominences\r\nwere not only well observed by the astronomers, but drew tremendous\r\napplause from the watching multitudes.\r\n\r\nThe success of the observations made during this eclipse prompted\r\nastronomers to pay similar attention to that of July 28, 1851, the total\r\nphase of which was to be visible in the south of Norway and Sweden, and\r\nacross the east of Prussia. This eclipse was also a success, and it was\r\nnow ascertained that the red prominences belonged to the sun and not to\r\nthe moon; for the lunar disc, as it moved onward, was seen to cover and\r\nto uncover them in turn. It was also noted that these prominences were\r\nmerely uprushes from a layer of glowing gaseous matter, which was seen\r\nclosely to envelop the sun.\r\n\r\nThe total eclipse of July 18, 1860, was observed in Spain, and\r\nphotography was for the first time _systematically_ employed in its\r\nobservation.[7] In the photographs taken the stationary appearance of\r\nboth the corona and prominences with respect to the moving moon,\r\ndefinitely confirmed the view already put forward that they were actual\r\nappendages of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of August 18, 1868, the total phase of which lasted nearly\r\nsix minutes, was visible in India, and drew thither a large concourse of\r\nastronomers. In this eclipse the spectroscope came to the front, and\r\nshowed that both the prominences, and the chromospheric layer from which\r\nthey rise, are composed of glowing vapours--chief among which is the\r\nvapour of hydrogen. The direct result of the observations made on this\r\noccasion was the spectroscopic method of examining prominences at any\r\ntime in full daylight, and without a total eclipse. This method, which\r\nhas given such an immense impetus to the study of the sun, was the\r\noutcome of independent and simultaneous investigation on the part of the\r\nFrench astronomer, the late M. Janssen, and the English astronomer,\r\nProfessor (now Sir Norman) Lockyer, a circumstance strangely reminiscent\r\nof the discovery of Neptune. The principles on which the method was\r\nfounded seem, however, to have occurred to Dr. (now Sir William) Huggins\r\nsome time previously.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of December 22, 1870, was total for a little more than two\r\nminutes, and its track passed across the Mediterranean. M. Janssen, of\r\nwhom mention has just been made, escaped in a balloon from then besieged\r\nParis, taking his instruments with him, and made his way to Oran, in\r\nAlgeria, in order to observe it; but his expectations were disappointed\r\nby cloudy weather. The expedition sent out from England had the\r\nmisfortune to be shipwrecked off the coast of Sicily. But the occasion\r\nwas redeemed by a memorable observation made by the American astronomer,\r\nthe late Professor Young, which revealed the existence of what is now\r\nknown as the \"Reversing Layer.\" This is a shallow layer of gases which\r\nlies immediately beneath the chromosphere. An illustration of the\r\ncorona, as it was seen during the above eclipse, will be found on Plate\r\nVII. (A), p. 142.\r\n\r\nIn the eclipse of December 12, 1871, total across Southern India, the\r\nphotographs of the corona obtained by Mr. Davis, assistant to Lord\r\nLindsay (now the Earl of Crawford), displayed a wealth of detail\r\nhitherto unapproached.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of July 29, 1878, total across the western states of North\r\nAmerica, was a remarkable success, and a magnificent view of the corona\r\nwas obtained by the well-known American astronomer and physicist, the\r\nlate Professor Langley, from the summit of Pike's Peak, Colorado, over\r\n14,000 feet above the level of the sea. The coronal streamers were seen\r\nto extend to a much greater distance at this altitude than at points\r\nless elevated, and the corona itself remained visible during more than\r\nfour minutes after the end of totality. It was, however, not entirely a\r\nquestion of altitude; the coronal streamers were actually very much\r\nlonger on this occasion than in most of the eclipses which had\r\npreviously been observed.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of May 17, 1882, observed in Upper Egypt, is notable from\r\nthe fact that, in one of the photographs taken by Dr. Schuster at Sohag,\r\na bright comet appeared near the outer limit of the corona (see Plate\r\nI., p. 96). The comet in question had not been seen before the eclipse,\r\nand was never seen afterwards. This is the third occasion on which\r\nattention has been drawn to a comet _merely_ by a total eclipse. The\r\nfirst is mentioned by Seneca; and the second by Philostorgius, in an\r\naccount of an eclipse observed at Constantinople in A.D. 418. A fourth\r\ncase of the kind occurred in 1893, when faint evidences of one of these\r\nfilmy objects were found on photographs of the corona taken by the\r\nAmerican astronomer, Professor Schaeberle, during the total eclipse of\r\nApril 16 of that year.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of May 6, 1883, had a totality of over five minutes, but\r\nthe central track unfortunately passed across the Pacific Ocean, and the\r\nsole point of land available for observing it from was one of the\r\nMarquesas Group, Caroline Island, a coral atoll seven and a half miles\r\nlong by one and a half broad. Nevertheless astronomers did not hesitate\r\nto take up their posts upon that little spot, and were rewarded with\r\ngood weather.\r\n\r\nThe next eclipse of importance was that of April 16, 1893. It stretched\r\nfrom Chili across South America and the Atlantic Ocean to the West Coast\r\nof Africa, and, as the weather was fine, many good results were\r\nobtained. Photographs were taken at both ends of the track, and these\r\nshowed that the appearance of the corona remained unchanged during the\r\ninterval of time occupied by the passage of the shadow across the earth.\r\nIt was on the occasion of this eclipse that Professor Schaeberle found\r\nupon his photographs those traces of the presence of a comet, to which\r\nallusion has already been made.\r\n\r\nExtensive preparations were made to observe the eclipse of August 9,\r\n1896. Totality lasted from two to three minutes, and the track stretched\r\nfrom Norway to Japan. Bad weather disappointed the observers, with the\r\nexception of those taken to Nova Zembla by Sir George Baden Powell in\r\nhis yacht _Otaria_.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of January 22, 1898, across India _viâ_ Bombay and Benares,\r\nwas favoured with good weather, and is notable for a photograph obtained\r\nby Mrs. E.W. Maunder, which showed a ray of the corona extending to a\r\nmost unusual distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I. THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OF MAY 17TH, 1882\r\n\r\nA comet is here shown in the immediate neighbourhood of the corona.\r\n\r\nDrawn by Mr. W.H. Wesley from the photographs.\r\n\r\n(Page 95)]\r\n\r\nOf very great influence in the growth of our knowledge with regard to\r\nthe sun, is the remarkable piece of good fortune by which the countries\r\naround the Mediterranean, so easy of access, have been favoured with a\r\ncomparatively large number of total eclipses during the past sixty\r\nyears. Tracks of totality have, for instance, traversed the Spanish\r\npeninsula on no less than five occasions during that period. Two of\r\nthese are among the most notable eclipses of recent years, namely, those\r\nof May 28, 1900, and of August 30, 1905. In the former the track of\r\ntotality stretched from the western seaboard of Mexico, through the\r\nSouthern States of America, and across the Atlantic Ocean, after which\r\nit passed over Portugal and Spain into North Africa. The total phase\r\nlasted for about a minute and a half, and the eclipse was well observed\r\nfrom a great many points along the line. A representation of the corona,\r\nas it appeared on this occasion, will be found on Plate VII. (B), p.\r\n142.\r\n\r\nThe track of the other eclipse to which we have alluded, _i.e._ that of\r\nAugust 30, 1905, crossed Spain about 200 miles to the northward of that\r\nof 1900. It stretched from Winnipeg in Canada, through Labrador, and\r\nover the Atlantic; then traversing Spain, it passed across the Balearic\r\nIslands, North Africa, and Egypt, and ended in Arabia (see Fig. 6, p.\r\n81). Much was to be expected from a comparison between the photographs\r\ntaken in Labrador and Egypt on the question as to whether the corona\r\nwould show any alteration in shape during the time that the shadow was\r\ntraversing the intervening space--some 6000 miles. The duration of the\r\ntotal phase in this eclipse was nearly four minutes. Bad weather,\r\nhowever, interfered a good deal with the observations. It was not\r\npossible, for instance, to do anything at all in Labrador. In Spain the\r\nweather conditions were by no means favourable; though at Burgos, where\r\nan immense number of people had assembled, the total phase was,\r\nfortunately, well seen. On the whole, the best results were obtained at\r\nGuelma in Algeria. The corona on the occasion of this eclipse was a very\r\nfine one, and some magnificent groups of prominences were plainly\r\nvisible to the naked eye (see the Frontispiece).\r\n\r\nThe next total eclipse after that of 1905 was one which occurred on\r\nJanuary 14, 1907. It passed across Central Asia and Siberia, and had a\r\ntotality lasting two and a half minutes at most; but it was not observed\r\nas the weather was extremely bad, a circumstance not surprising with\r\nregard to those regions at that time of year.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of January 3, 1908, passed across the Pacific Ocean. Only\r\ntwo small coral islands--Hull Island in the Phoenix Group, and Flint\r\nIsland about 400 miles north of Tahiti--lay in the track. Two\r\nexpeditions set out to observe it, _i.e._ a combined American party from\r\nthe Lick Observatory and the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, and\r\na private one from England under Mr. F.K. McClean. As Hull Island\r\nafforded few facilities, both parties installed their instruments on\r\nFlint Island, although it was very little better. The duration of the\r\ntotal phase was fairly long--about four minutes, and the sun very\r\nfavourably placed, being nearly overhead. Heavy rain and clouds,\r\nhowever, marred observation during the first minute of totality, but the\r\nremaining three minutes were successfully utilised, good photographs of\r\nthe corona being obtained.\r\n\r\nThe next few years to come are unfortunately by no means favourable\r\nfrom the point of view of the eclipse observer. An eclipse will take\r\nplace on June 17, 1909, the track stretching from Greenland across the\r\nNorth Polar regions into Siberia. The geographical situation is,\r\nhowever, a very awkward one, and totality will be extremely short--only\r\nsix seconds in Greenland and twenty-three seconds in Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of May 9, 1910, will be visible in Tasmania. Totality will\r\nlast so long as four minutes, but the sun will be at the time much too\r\nlow in the sky for good observation.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of the following year, April 28, 1911, will also be\r\nconfined, roughly speaking, to the same quarter of the earth, the track\r\npassing across the old convict settlement of Norfolk Island, and then\r\nout into the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of April 17, 1912, will stretch from Portugal, through\r\nFrance and Belgium into North Germany. It will, however, be of\r\npractically no service to astronomy. Totality, for instance, will last\r\nfor only three seconds in Portugal; and, though Paris lies in the\r\ncentral track, the eclipse, which begins as barely total, will have\r\nchanged into an _annular_ one by the time it passes over that city.\r\n\r\nThe first really favourable eclipse in the near future will be that of\r\nAugust 21, 1914. Its track will stretch from Greenland across Norway,\r\nSweden, and Russia. This eclipse is a return, after one saros, of the\r\neclipse of August 9, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe last solar eclipse which we will touch upon is that predicted for\r\nJune 29, 1927. It has been already alluded to as the first of those in\r\nthe future to be _total_ in England. The central line will stretch from\r\nWales in a north-easterly direction. Stonyhurst Observatory, in\r\nLancashire, will lie in the track; but totality there will be very\r\nshort, only about twenty seconds in duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] _Knowledge_, vol. xx. p. 9, January 1897.\r\n\r\n[7] The _first photographic representation of the corona_ had, however,\r\nbeen made during the eclipse of 1851. This was a daguerreotype taken by\r\nDr. Busch at Königsberg in Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFAMOUS ECLIPSES OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest lunar eclipse, of which we have any trustworthy\r\ninformation, was a total one which took place on the 19th March, 721\r\nB.C., and was observed from Babylon. For our knowledge of this eclipse\r\nwe are indebted to Ptolemy, the astronomer, who copied it, along with\r\ntwo others, from the records of the reign of the Chaldean king,\r\nMerodach-Baladan.\r\n\r\nThe next eclipse of the moon worth noting was a total one, which took\r\nplace some three hundred years later, namely, in 425 B.C. This eclipse\r\nwas observed at Athens, and is mentioned by Aristophanes in his play,\r\n_The Clouds_.\r\n\r\nPlutarch relates that a total eclipse of the moon, which occurred in 413\r\nB.C., so greatly frightened Nicias, the general of the Athenians, then\r\nwarring in Sicily, as to cause a delay in his retreat from Syracuse\r\nwhich led to the destruction of his whole army.\r\n\r\nSeven years later--namely, in 406 B.C., the twenty-sixth year of the\r\nPeloponnesian War--there took place another total lunar eclipse of which\r\nmention is made by Xenophon.\r\n\r\nOmitting a number of other eclipses alluded to by ancient writers, we\r\ncome to one recorded by Josephus as having occurred a little before the\r\ndeath of Herod the Great. It is probable that the eclipse in question\r\nwas the total lunar one, which calculation shows to have taken place on\r\nthe 15th September 5 B.C., and to have been visible in Western Asia.\r\nThis is very important, for we are thus enabled to fix that year as the\r\ndate of the birth of Christ, for Herod is known to have died in the\r\nearly part of the year following the Nativity.\r\n\r\nIn those accounts of total lunar eclipses, which have come down to us\r\nfrom the Dark and Middle Ages, the colour of the moon is nearly always\r\nlikened to \"blood.\" On the other hand, in an account of the eclipse of\r\nJanuary 23, A.D. 753, our satellite is described as \"covered with a\r\nhorrid black shield.\" We thus have examples of the two distinct\r\nappearances alluded to in Chapter VII., _i.e._ when the moon appears of\r\na coppery-red colour, and when it is entirely darkened.\r\n\r\nIt appears, indeed, that, in the majority of lunar eclipses on record,\r\nthe moon has appeared of a ruddy, or rather of a coppery hue, and the\r\ndetails on its surface have been thus rendered visible. One of the best\r\nexamples of a _bright_ eclipse of this kind is that of the 19th March\r\n1848, when the illumination of our satellite was so great that many\r\npersons could not believe that an eclipse was actually taking place. A\r\ncertain Mr. Foster, who observed this eclipse from Bruges, states that\r\nthe markings on the lunar disc were almost as visible as on an \"ordinary\r\ndull moonlight night.\" He goes on to say that the British Consul at\r\nGhent, not knowing that there had been any eclipse, wrote to him for an\r\nexplanation of the red colour of the moon on that evening.\r\n\r\nOut of the _dark_ eclipses recorded, perhaps the best example is that\r\nof May 18, 1761, observed by Wargentin at Stockholm. On this occasion\r\nthe lunar disc is said to have disappeared so completely, that it could\r\nnot be discovered even with the telescope. Another such instance is the\r\neclipse of June 10, 1816, observed from London. The summer of that year\r\nwas particularly wet--a point worthy of notice in connection with the\r\ntheory that these different appearances are due to the varying state of\r\nour earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSometimes, indeed, it has happened that an eclipse of the moon has\r\npartaken of both appearances, part of the disc being visible and part\r\ninvisible. An instance of this occurred in the eclipse of July 12, 1870,\r\nwhen the late Rev. S.J. Johnson, one of the leading authorities on\r\neclipses, who observed it, states that he found one-half the moon's\r\nsurface quite invisible, both with the naked eye and with the telescope.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the examples given above, there are three total lunar\r\neclipses which deserve especial mention.\r\n\r\n1. A.D. 755, November 23. During the progress of this eclipse the moon\r\nocculted the star Aldebaran in the constellation of Taurus.\r\n\r\n2. A.D. 1493, April 2. This is the celebrated eclipse which is said to\r\nhave so well served the purposes of Christopher Columbus. Certain\r\nnatives having refused to supply him with provisions when in sore\r\nstraits, he announced to them that the moon would be darkened as a sign\r\nof the anger of heaven. When the event duly came to pass, the savages\r\nwere so terrified that they brought him provisions as much as he needed.\r\n\r\n3. A.D. 1610, July 6. The eclipse in question is notable as having been\r\nseen through the telescope, then a recent invention. It was without\r\ndoubt the first so observed, but unfortunately the name of the observer\r\nhas not come down to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF OBSERVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest astronomical observations must have been made in the Dawn\r\nof Historic Time by the men who tended their flocks upon the great\r\nplains. As they watched the clear night sky they no doubt soon noticed\r\nthat, with the exception of the moon and those brilliant wandering\r\nobjects known to us as the planets, the individual stars in the heaven\r\nremained apparently fixed with reference to each other. These seemingly\r\nchangeless points of light came in time to be regarded as sign-posts to\r\nguide the wanderer across the trackless desert, or the voyager upon the\r\nwide sea.\r\n\r\nJust as when looking into the red coals of a fire, or when watching the\r\nclouds, our imagination conjures up strange and grotesque forms, so did\r\nthe men of old see in the grouping of the stars the outlines of weird\r\nand curious shapes. Fed with mythological lore, they imagined these to\r\nbe rough representations of ancient heroes and fabled beasts, whom they\r\nsupposed to have been elevated to the heavens as a reward for great\r\ndeeds done upon the earth. We know these groupings of stars to-day under\r\nthe name of the Constellations. Looking up at them we find it extremely\r\ndifficult to fit in the majority with the figures which the ancients\r\nbelieved them to represent. Nevertheless, astronomy has accepted the\r\narrangement, for want of a better method of fixing the leading stars in\r\nthe memory.\r\n\r\nOur early ancestors lived the greater part of their lives in the open\r\nair, and so came to pay more attention in general to the heavenly orbs\r\nthan we do. Their clock and their calendar was, so to speak, in the\r\ncelestial vault. They regulated their hours, their days, and their\r\nnights by the changing positions of the sun, the moon, and the stars;\r\nand recognised the periods of seed-time and harvest, of calm and stormy\r\nweather, by the rising or setting of certain well-known constellations.\r\nStudents of the classics will recall many allusions to this, especially\r\nin the Odes of Horace.\r\n\r\nAs time went on and civilisation progressed, men soon devised measuring\r\ninstruments, by means of which they could note the positions of the\r\ncelestial bodies in the sky with respect to each other; and, from\r\nobservations thus made, they constructed charts of the stars. The\r\nearliest complete survey of this kind, of which we have a record, is the\r\ngreat Catalogue of stars which was made, in the second century B.C., by\r\nthe celebrated Greek astronomer, Hipparchus, and in which he is said to\r\nhave noted down about 1080 stars.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow in detail the tedious progress of\r\nastronomical discovery prior to the advent of the telescope. Certain it\r\nis that, as time went on, the measuring instruments to which we have\r\nalluded had become greatly improved; but, had they even been perfect,\r\nthey would have been utterly inadequate to reveal those minute\r\ndisplacements, from which we have learned the actual distance of the\r\nnearest of the celestial orbs. From the early times, therefore, until\r\nthe mediæval period of our own era, astronomy grew up upon a faulty\r\nbasis, for the earth ever seemed so much the largest body in the\r\nuniverse, that it continued from century to century to be regarded as\r\nthe very centre of things.\r\n\r\nTo the Arabians is due the credit of having kept alive the study of the\r\nstars during the dark ages of European history. They erected some fine\r\nobservatories, notably in Spain and in the neighbourhood of Bagdad.\r\nFollowing them, some of the Oriental peoples embraced the science in\r\nearnest; Ulugh Beigh, grandson of the famous Tamerlane, founding, for\r\ninstance, a great observatory at Samarcand in Central Asia. The Mongol\r\nemperors of India also established large astronomical instruments in the\r\nchief cities of their empire. When the revival of learning took place in\r\nthe West, the Europeans came to the front once more in science, and\r\nrapidly forged ahead of those who had so assiduously kept alight the\r\nlamp of knowledge through the long centuries.\r\n\r\nThe dethronement of the older theories by the Copernican system, in\r\nwhich the earth was relegated to its true place, was fortunately soon\r\nfollowed by an invention of immense import, the invention of the\r\nTelescope. It is to this instrument, indeed, that we are indebted for\r\nour knowledge of the actual scale of the celestial distances. It\r\npenetrated the depths of space; it brought the distant orbs so near,\r\nthat men could note the detail on the planets, or measure the small\r\nchanges in their positions in the sky which resulted from the movement\r\nof our own globe.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1609 that the telescope was first constructed. A\r\nyear or so previous to this a spectacle-maker of Middleburgh in Holland,\r\none Hans Lippershey, had, it appears, hit upon the fact that distant\r\nobjects, when viewed through certain glass lenses suitably arranged,\r\nlooked nearer.[8] News of this discovery reached the ears of Galileo\r\nGalilei, of Florence, the foremost philosopher of the day, and he at\r\nonce applied his great scientific attainments to the construction of an\r\ninstrument based upon this principle. The result was what was called an\r\n\"optick tube,\" which magnified distant objects some few times. It was\r\nnot much larger than what we nowadays contemptuously refer to as a\r\n\"spy-glass,\" yet its employment upon the leading celestial objects\r\ninstantly sent astronomical science onward with a bound. In rapid\r\nsuccession Galileo announced world-moving discoveries; large spots upon\r\nthe face of the sun; crater-like mountains upon the moon; four\r\nsubordinate bodies, or satellites, circling around the planet Jupiter;\r\nand a strange appearance in connection with Saturn, which later\r\ntelescopic observers found to be a broad flat ring encircling that\r\nplanet. And more important still, the magnified image of Venus showed\r\nitself in the telescope at certain periods in crescent and other forms;\r\na result which Copernicus is said to have announced should of necessity\r\nfollow if his system were the true one.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries made with the telescope produced, as time went on, a\r\ngreat alteration in the notions of men with regard to the universe at\r\nlarge. It must have been, indeed, a revelation to find that those points\r\nof light which they called the planets, were, after all, globes of a\r\nsize comparable with the earth, and peopled perchance with sentient\r\nbeings. Even to us, who have been accustomed since our early youth to\r\nsuch an idea, it still requires a certain stretch of imagination to\r\nenlarge, say, the Bright Star of Eve, into a body similar in size to our\r\nearth. The reader will perhaps recollect Tennyson's allusion to this in\r\n_Locksley Hall, Sixty Years After_:--\r\n\r\n\"Hesper--Venus--were we native to that splendour or in Mars,\r\nWe should see the Globe we groan in, fairest of their evening stars.\r\n\r\n\"Could we dream of wars and carnage, craft and madness, lust and spite,\r\nRoaring London, raving Paris, in that point of peaceful light?\"\r\n\r\nThe form of instrument as devised by Galileo is called the Refracting\r\nTelescope, or \"Refractor.\" As we know it to-day it is the same in\r\nprinciple as his \"optick tube,\" but it is not quite the same in\r\nconstruction. The early _object-glass_, or large glass at the end, was a\r\nsingle convex lens (see Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Galilean\"); the modern one is,\r\non the other hand, composed of two lenses fitted together. The attempts\r\nto construct large telescopes of the Galilean type met in course of time\r\nwith a great difficulty. The magnified image of the object observed was\r\nnot quite pure; its edges, indeed, were fringed with rainbow-like\r\ncolours. This defect was found to be aggravated with increase in the\r\nsize of object-glasses. A method was, however, discovered of\r\ndiminishing this colouration, or _chromatic aberration_ as it is called\r\nfrom the Greek word [chrôma] (_chroma_), which means colour, viz. by\r\nmaking telescopes of great length and only a few inches in width. But\r\nthe remedy was, in a way, worse than the disease; for telescopes thus\r\nbecame of such huge proportions as to be too unwieldy for use. Attempts\r\nwere made to evade this unwieldiness by constructing them with skeleton\r\ntubes (see Plate II., p. 110), or, indeed, even without tubes at all;\r\nthe object-glass in the tubeless or \"aerial\" telescope being fixed at\r\nthe top of a high post, and the _eye-piece_, that small lens or\r\ncombination of lenses, which the eye looks directly into, being kept in\r\nline with it by means of a string and manoeuvred about near the ground\r\n(Plate III., p. 112). The idea of a telescope without a tube may appear\r\na contradiction in terms; but it is not really so, for the tube adds\r\nnothing to the magnifying power of the instrument, and is, in fact, no\r\nmore than a mere device for keeping the object-glass and eye-piece in a\r\nstraight line, and for preventing the observer from being hindered by\r\nstray lights in his neighbourhood. It goes without saying, of course,\r\nthat the image of a celestial object will be more clear and defined when\r\nexamined in the darkness of a tube.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, though they knew nothing of telescopes, had, however,\r\nfound out the merit of a tube in this respect; for they employed simple\r\ntubes, blackened on the inside, in order to obtain a clearer view of\r\ndistant objects. It is said that Julius Cæsar, before crossing the\r\nChannel, surveyed the opposite coast of Britain through a tube of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II. GREAT TELESCOPE OF HEVELIUS\r\n\r\nThis instrument, 150 feet in length, with a _skeleton_ tube, was\r\nconstructed by the celebrated seventeenth century astronomer, Hevelius\r\nof Danzig. From an illustration in the _Machina Celestis_.\r\n\r\n(Page 110)]\r\n\r\nA few of the most famous of the immensely long telescopes above alluded\r\nto are worthy of mention. One of these, 123 feet in length, was\r\npresented to the Royal Society of London by the Dutch astronomer\r\nHuyghens. Hevelius of Danzig constructed a skeleton one of 150 feet in\r\nlength (see Plate II., p. 110). Bradley used a tubeless one 212 feet\r\nlong to measure the diameter of Venus in 1722; while one of 600 feet is\r\nsaid to have been constructed, but to have proved quite unworkable!\r\n\r\nSuch difficulties, however, produced their natural result. They set men\r\nat work to devise another kind of telescope. In the new form, called the\r\nReflecting Telescope, or \"Reflector,\" the light coming from the object\r\nunder observation was _reflected_ into the eye-piece from the surface of\r\na highly polished concave metallic mirror, or _speculum_, as it was\r\ncalled. It is to Sir Isaac Newton that the world is indebted for the\r\nreflecting telescope in its best form. That philosopher had set himself\r\nto investigate the causes of the rainbow-like, or prismatic colours\r\nwhich for a long time had been such a source of annoyance to telescopic\r\nobservers; and he pointed out that, as the colours were produced in the\r\npassage of the rays of light _through_ the glass, they would be entirely\r\nabsent if the light were reflected from the _surface_ of a mirror\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nThe reflecting telescope, however, had in turn certain drawbacks of its\r\nown. A mirror, for instance, can plainly never be polished to such a\r\nhigh degree as to reflect as much light as a piece of transparent glass\r\nwill let through. Further, the position of the eye-piece is by no means\r\nso convenient. It cannot, of course, be pointed directly towards the\r\nmirror, for the observer would then have to place his head right in the\r\nway of the light coming from the celestial object, and would thus, of\r\ncourse, cut it off. In order to obviate this difficulty, the following\r\ndevice was employed by Newton in his telescope, of which he constructed\r\nhis first example in 1668. A small, flat mirror was fixed by thin wires\r\nin the centre of the tube of the telescope, and near to its open end. It\r\nwas set slant-wise, so that it reflected the rays of light directly into\r\nthe eye-piece, which was screwed into a hole at the side of the tube\r\n(see Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Newtonian\").\r\n\r\nAlthough the Newtonian form of telescope had the immense advantage of\r\ndoing away with the prismatic colours, yet it wasted a great deal of\r\nlight; for the objection in this respect with regard to loss of light by\r\nreflection from the large mirror applied, of course, to the small mirror\r\nalso. In addition, the position of the \"flat,\" as the small mirror is\r\ncalled, had the further effect of excluding from the great mirror a\r\ncertain proportion of light. But the reflector had the advantage, on the\r\nother hand, of costing less to make than the refractor, as it was not\r\nnecessary to procure flawless glass for the purpose. A disc of a certain\r\nmetallic composition, an alloy of copper and tin, known in consequence\r\nas _speculum metal_, had merely to be cast; and this had to be ground\r\nand polished _upon one side only_, whereas a lens has to be thus treated\r\n_upon both its sides_. It was, therefore, possible to make a much larger\r\ninstrument at a great deal less labour and expense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III. A TUBELESS, OR \"AERIAL\" TELESCOPE\r\n\r\nFrom an illustration in the _Opera Varia_ of Christian Huyghens.\r\n\r\n(Page 110)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--The various types of Telescope. All the above\r\ntelescopes are _pointed_ in the same direction; that is to say, the rays\r\nof light from the object are coming from the left-hand side.]\r\n\r\nWe have given the Newtonian form as an example of the principle of the\r\nreflecting telescope. A somewhat similar instrument had, however, been\r\nprojected, though not actually constructed, by James Gregory a few years\r\nearlier than Newton's, _i.e._ in 1663. In this form of reflector, known\r\nas the \"Gregorian\" telescope, a hole was made in the big concave mirror;\r\nand a small mirror, also concave, which faced it at a certain distance,\r\nreceived the reflected rays, and reflected them back again through the\r\nhole in question into the eye-piece, which was fixed just behind (see\r\nFig. 8, p. 113, \"Gregorian\"). The Gregorian had thus the sentimental\r\nadvantage of being _pointed directly at the object_. The hole in the big\r\nmirror did not cause any loss of light, for the central portion in which\r\nit was made was anyway unable to receive light through the small mirror\r\nbeing directly in front of it. An adaptation of the Gregorian was the\r\n\"Cassegrainian\" telescope, devised by Cassegrain in 1672, which differed\r\nfrom it chiefly in the small mirror being convex instead of concave (see\r\nFig. 8, p. 113, \"Cassegrainian\"). These _direct-view_ forms of the\r\nreflecting telescope were much in vogue about the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, when many beautiful examples of Gregorians were made\r\nby the famous optician, James Short, of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nAn adaptation of the Newtonian type of telescope is known as the\r\n\"Herschelian,\" from being the kind favoured by Sir William Herschel. It\r\nis, however, only suitable in immense instruments, such as Herschel was\r\nin the habit of employing. In this form the object-glass is set at a\r\nslight slant, so that the light coming from the object is reflected\r\nstraight into the eye-piece, which is fixed facing it in the side of the\r\ntube (see Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Herschelian\"). This telescope has an\r\nadvantage over the other forms of reflector through the saving of light\r\nconsequent on doing away with the _second_ reflection. There is,\r\nhowever, the objection that the slant of the object-glass is productive\r\nof some distortion in the appearance of the object observed; but this\r\nslant is of necessity slight when the length of the telescope is very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThe principle of this type of telescope had been described to the\r\nFrench Academy of Sciences as early as 1728 by Le Maire, but no one\r\navailed himself of the idea until 1776, when Herschel tried it. At\r\nfirst, however, he rejected it; but in 1786 he seems to have found that\r\nit suited the huge instruments which he was then making. Herschel's\r\nlargest telescope, constructed in 1789, was about four feet in diameter\r\nand forty feet in length. It is generally spoken of as the \"Forty-foot\r\nTelescope,\" though all other instruments have been known by their\r\n_diameters_, rather than by their lengths.\r\n\r\nTo return to the refracting telescope. A solution of the colour\r\ndifficulty was arrived at in 1729 (two years after Newton's death) by an\r\nEssex gentleman named Chester Moor Hall. He discovered that by making a\r\ndouble object-glass, composed of an outer convex lens and an inner\r\nconcave lens, made respectively of different kinds of glass, _i.e._\r\n_crown_ glass and _flint_ glass, the troublesome colour effects could\r\nbe, _to a very great extent_, removed. Hall's investigations appear to\r\nhave been rather of an academic nature; and, although he is believed to\r\nhave constructed a small telescope upon these lines, yet he seems to\r\nhave kept the matter so much to himself that it was not until the year\r\n1758 that the first example of the new instrument was given to the\r\nworld. This was done by John Dollond, founder of the well-known optical\r\nfirm of Dollond, of Ludgate Hill, London, who had, quite independently,\r\nre-discovered the principle.\r\n\r\nThis \"Achromatic\" telescope, or telescope \"free from colour effects,\" is\r\nthe kind ordinarily in use at present, whether for astronomical or for\r\nterrestrial purposes (see Fig. 8, p. 113, \"Achromatic\"). The expense of\r\nmaking large instruments of this type is very great, for, in the\r\nobject-glass alone, no less than _four_ surfaces have to be ground and\r\npolished to the required curves; and, usually, the two lenses of which\r\nit is composed have to fit quite close together.\r\n\r\nWith the object of evading the expense referred to, and of securing\r\n_complete_ freedom from colour effects, telescopes have even been made,\r\nthe object-glasses of which were composed of various transparent liquids\r\nplaced between thin lenses; but leakages, and currents set up within\r\nthem by changes of temperature, have defeated the ingenuity of those who\r\ndevised these substitutes.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the colour difficulty by means of Dollond's achromatic\r\nrefractor has not, however, ousted the reflecting telescope in its best,\r\nor Newtonian form, for which great concave mirrors made of glass,\r\ncovered with a thin coating of silver and highly polished, have been\r\nused since about 1870 instead of metal mirrors. They are very much\r\nlighter in weight and cheaper to make than the old specula; and though\r\nthe silvering, needless to say, deteriorates with time, it can be\r\nrenewed at a comparatively trifling cost. Also these mirrors reflect\r\nmuch more light, and give a clearer view, than did the old metallic\r\nones.\r\n\r\nWhen an object is viewed through the type of astronomical telescope\r\nordinarily in use, it is seen _upside down_. This is, however, a matter\r\nof very small moment in dealing with celestial objects; for, as they are\r\nusually round, it is really not of much consequence which part we regard\r\nas top and which as bottom. Such an inversion would, of course, be most\r\ninconvenient when viewing terrestrial objects. In order to observe the\r\nlatter we therefore employ what is called a terrestrial telescope, which\r\nis merely a refractor with some extra lenses added in the eye portion\r\nfor the purpose of turning the inverted image the right way up again.\r\nThese extra lenses, needless to say, absorb a certain amount of light;\r\nwherefore it is better in astronomical observation to save light by\r\ndoing away with them, and putting up with the slight inconvenience of\r\nseeing the object inverted.\r\n\r\nThis inversion of images by the astronomical telescope must be specially\r\nborne in mind with regard to the photographs of the moon in Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1825 the largest achromatic refractor in existence was one\r\nof nine and a half inches in diameter constructed by Fraunhofer for the\r\nObservatory of Dorpat in Russia. The largest refractors in the world\r\nto-day are in the United States, _i.e._ the forty-inch of the Yerkes\r\nObservatory (see Plate IV., p. 118), and the thirty-six inch of the\r\nLick. The object-glasses of these and of the thirty-inch telescope of\r\nthe Observatory of Pulkowa, in Russia, were made by the great optical\r\nhouse of Alvan Clark & Sons, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A. The\r\ntubes and other portions of the Yerkes and Lick telescopes were,\r\nhowever, constructed by the Warner and Swasey Co., of Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe largest reflector, and so the largest telescope in the world, is\r\nstill the six-foot erected by the late Lord Rosse at Parsonstown in\r\nIreland, and completed in the year 1845. It is about fifty-six feet in\r\nlength. Next come two of five feet, with mirrors of silver on glass;\r\none of them made by the late Dr. Common, of Ealing, and the other by the\r\nAmerican astronomer, Professor G.W. Ritchey. The latter of these is\r\ninstalled in the Solar Observatory belonging to Carnegie Institution of\r\nWashington, which is situated on Mount Wilson in California. The former\r\nis now at the Harvard College Observatory, and is considered by\r\nProfessor Moulton to be probably the most efficient reflector in use at\r\npresent. Another large reflector is the three-foot made by Dr. Common.\r\nIt came into the possession of Mr. Crossley of Halifax, who presented it\r\nto the Lick Observatory, where it is now known as the \"Crossley\r\nReflector.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough to the house of Clark belongs, as we have seen, the credit of\r\nconstructing the object-glasses of the largest refracting telescopes of\r\nour time, it has nevertheless keen competitors in Sir Howard Grubb, of\r\nDublin, and such well-known firms as Cooke of York and Steinheil of\r\nMunich. In the four-foot reflector, made in 1870 for the Observatory of\r\nMelbourne by the firm of Grubb, the Cassegrainian principle was\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the various merits of refractors and reflectors much\r\nmight be said. Each kind of instrument has, indeed, its special\r\nadvantages; though perhaps, on the whole, the most perfect type of\r\ntelescope is the achromatic refractor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV. THE GREAT YERKES TELESCOPE\r\n\r\nGreat telescope at the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago,\r\nWilliams Bay, Wisconsin, U.S.A. It was erected in 1896-7, and is the\r\nlargest refracting telescope in the world. Diameter of object-glass, 40\r\ninches; length of telescope, about 60 feet. The object-glass was made by\r\nthe firm of Alvan Clark and Sons, of Cambridge, Massachusetts; the other\r\nportions of the instrument by the Warner and Swasey Co., of Cleveland,\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n(Page 117)]\r\n\r\nIn connection with telescopes certain devices have from time to time\r\nbeen introduced, but these merely aim at the _convenience_ of the\r\nobserver and do not supplant the broad principles upon which are based\r\nthe various types of instrument above described. Such, for instance, are\r\nthe \"Siderostat,\" and another form of it called the \"Coelostat,\" in\r\nwhich a plane mirror is made to revolve in a certain manner, so as to\r\nreflect those portions of the sky which are to be observed, into the\r\ntube of a telescope kept fixed. Such too are the \"Equatorial Coudé\" of\r\nthe late M. Loewy, Director of the Paris Observatory, and the\r\n\"Sheepshanks Telescope\" of the Observatory of Cambridge, in which a\r\ntelescope is separated into two portions, the eye-piece portion being\r\nfixed upon a downward slant, and the object-glass portion jointed to it\r\nat an angle and pointed up at the sky. In these two instruments (which,\r\nby the way, differ materially) an arrangement of slanting mirrors in the\r\ntubes directs the journey of the rays of light from the object-glass to\r\nthe eye-piece. The observer can thus sit at the eye-end of his telescope\r\nin the warmth and comfort of his room, and observe the stars in the same\r\nunconstrained manner as if he were merely looking down into a\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, devices such as these are subject to the drawback that\r\nthe mirrors employed sap a certain proportion of the rays of light. It\r\nwill be remembered that we made allusion to loss of light in this way,\r\nwhen pointing out the advantage in light grasp of the Herschelian form\r\nof telescope, where only _one_ reflection takes place, over the\r\nNewtonian in which there are _two_.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question as to whether telescopes can be made much\r\nlarger. The American astronomer, Professor G.E. Hale, concludes that the\r\nlimit of refractors is about five feet in diameter, but he thinks that\r\nreflectors as large as nine feet in diameter might now be made. As\r\nregards refractors there are several strong reasons against augmenting\r\ntheir proportions. First of all comes the great cost. Secondly, since\r\nthe lenses are held in position merely round their rims, they will bend\r\nby their weight in the centres if they are made much larger. On the\r\nother hand, attempts to obviate this, by making the lenses thicker,\r\nwould cause a decrease in the amount of light let through.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest stumbling-block to the construction of larger\r\ntelescopes is the fact that the unsteadiness of the air will be\r\nincreasingly magnified. And further, the larger the tubes become, the\r\nmore difficult will it be to keep the air within them at one constant\r\ntemperature throughout their lengths.\r\n\r\nIt would, indeed, seem as if telescopes are not destined greatly to\r\nincrease in size, but that the means of observation will break out in\r\nsome new direction, as it has already done in the case of photography\r\nand the spectroscope. The direct use of the eye is gradually giving\r\nplace to indirect methods. We are, in fact, now _feeling_ rather than\r\nseeing our way about the universe. Up to the present, for instance, we\r\nhave not the slightest proof that life exists elsewhere than upon our\r\nearth. But who shall say that the twentieth century has not that in\r\nstore for us, by which the presence of life in other orbs may be\r\nperceived through some form of vibration transmitted across illimitable\r\nspace? There is no use speaking of the impossible or the inconceivable.\r\nAfter the extraordinary revelations of the spectroscope--nay, after the\r\nastounding discovery of Röntgen--the word impossible should be cast\r\naside, and inconceivability cease to be regarded as any criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] The principle upon which the telescope is based appears to have been\r\nknown _theoretically_ for a long time previous to this. The monk Roger\r\nBacon, who lived in the thirteenth century, describes it very clearly;\r\nand several writers of the sixteenth century have also dealt with the\r\nidea. Even Lippershey's claims to a practical solution of the question\r\nwere hotly contested at the time by two of his own countrymen, _i.e._ a\r\ncertain Jacob Metius, and another spectacle-maker of Middleburgh, named\r\nJansen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSPECTRUM ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf white light (that of the sun, for instance) be passed through a glass\r\nprism, namely, a piece of glass of triangular shape, it will issue from\r\nit in rainbow-tinted colours. It is a common experience with any of us\r\nto notice this when the sunlight shines through cut-glass, as in the\r\npendant of a chandelier, or in the stopper of a wine-decanter.\r\n\r\nThe same effect may be produced when light passes through water. The\r\nRainbow, which we all know so well, is merely the result of the sunlight\r\npassing through drops of falling rain.\r\n\r\nWhite light is composed of rays of various colours. Red, orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, indigo, and violet, taken all together, go, in fact, to\r\nmake up that effect which we call white.\r\n\r\nIt is in the course of the _refraction_, or bending of a beam of light,\r\nwhen it passes in certain conditions through a transparent and denser\r\nmedium, such as glass or water, that the constituent rays are sorted out\r\nand spread in a row according to their various colours. This production\r\nof colour takes place usually near the edges of a lens; and, as will be\r\nrecollected, proved very obnoxious to the users of the old form of\r\nrefracting telescope.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a strange irony of fate that this very same production\r\nof colour, which so hindered astronomy in the past, should have aided it\r\nin recent years to a remarkable degree. If sunlight, for instance, be\r\nadmitted through a narrow slit before it falls upon a glass prism, it\r\nwill issue from the latter in the form of a band of variegated colour,\r\neach colour blending insensibly with the next. The colours arrange\r\nthemselves always in the order which we have mentioned. This seeming\r\nband is, in reality, an array of countless coloured images of the\r\noriginal slit ranged side by side; the colour of each image being the\r\nslightest possible shade different from that next to it. This strip of\r\ncolour when produced by sunlight is called the \"Solar Spectrum\" (see\r\nFig. 9, p. 123). A similar strip, or _spectrum_, will be produced by any\r\nother light; but the appearance of the strip, with regard to\r\npreponderance of particular colours, will depend upon the character of\r\nthat light. Electric light and gas light yield spectra not unlike that\r\nof sunlight; but that of gas is less rich in blue and violet than that\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nThe Spectroscope, an instrument devised for the examination of spectra,\r\nis, in its simplest form, composed of a small tube with a narrow slit\r\nand prism at one end, and an eye-piece at the other. If we drop ordinary\r\ntable salt into the flame of a gas light, the flame becomes strongly\r\nyellow. If, then, we observe this yellow flame with the spectroscope, we\r\nfind that its spectrum consists almost entirely of two bright yellow\r\ntransverse lines. Chemically considered ordinary table salt is sodium\r\nchloride; that is to say, a compound of the metal sodium and the gas\r\nchlorine. Now if other compounds of sodium be experimented with in the\r\nsame manner, it will soon be found that these two yellow lines are\r\ncharacteristic of sodium when turned into vapour by great heat. In the\r\nsame manner it can be ascertained that every element, when heated to a\r\ncondition of vapour, gives as its spectrum a set of lines peculiar to\r\nitself. Thus the spectroscope enables us to find out the composition of\r\nsubstances when they are reduced to vapour in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--The Solar Spectrum.]\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the power of a spectroscope, it is necessary to\r\nadd to the number of prisms. Each extra prism has the effect of\r\nlengthening the coloured strip still more, so that lines, which at first\r\nappeared to be single merely through being crowded together, are\r\neventually drawn apart and become separately distinguishable.\r\n\r\nOn this principle it has gradually been determined that the sun is\r\ncomposed of elements similar to those which go to make up our earth.\r\nFurther, the composition of the stars can be ascertained in the same\r\nmanner; and we find them formed on a like pattern, though with certain\r\nelements in greater or less proportion as the case may be. It is in\r\nconsequence of our thus definitely ascertaining that the stars are\r\nself-luminous, and of a sun-like character, that we are enabled to speak\r\nof them as _suns_, or to call the sun a _star_.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to discover the elements of which the planets and\r\nsatellites of our system are composed, we, however, find ourselves\r\nbaffled, for the simple reason that these bodies emit no real light of\r\ntheir own. The light which reaches us from them, being merely reflected\r\nsunlight, gives only the ordinary solar spectrum when examined with the\r\nspectroscope. But in certain cases we find that the solar spectrum thus\r\nviewed shows traces of being weakened, or rather of suffering\r\nabsorption; and it is concluded that this may be due to the sunlight\r\nhaving had to pass through an atmosphere on its way to and from the\r\nsurface of the planet from which it is reflected to us.\r\n\r\nSince the sun is found to be composed of elements similar to those which\r\ngo to make up our earth, we need not be disheartened at this failure of\r\nthe spectroscope to inform us of the composition of the planets and\r\nsatellites. We are justified, indeed, in assuming that more or less the\r\nsame constituents run through our solar system; and that the elements of\r\nwhich these bodies are composed are similar to those which are found\r\nupon our earth and in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope supplies us with even more information. It tells us,\r\nindeed, whether the sun-like body which we are observing is moving away\r\nfrom us or towards us. A certain slight shifting of the lines towards\r\nthe red or violet end of the spectrum respectively, is found to follow\r\nsuch movement. This method of observation is known by the name of\r\n_Doppler's Method_,[9] and by it we are enabled to confirm the evidence\r\nwhich the sunspots give us of the rotation of the sun; for we find thus\r\nthat one edge of that body is continually approaching us, and the other\r\nedge is continually receding from us. Also, we can ascertain in the same\r\nmanner that certain of the stars are moving towards us, and certain of\r\nthem away from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] The idea, initiated by Christian Doppler at Prague in 1842, was\r\noriginally applied to sound. The approach or recession of a source from\r\nwhich sound is coming is invariably accompanied by alterations of pitch,\r\nas the reader has no doubt noticed when a whistling railway-engine has\r\napproached him or receded from him. It is to Sir William Huggins,\r\nhowever, that we are indebted for the application of the principle to\r\nspectroscopy. This he gave experimental proof of in the year 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun is the chief member of our system. It controls the motions of\r\nthe planets by its immense gravitative power. Besides this it is the\r\nmost important body in the entire universe, so far as we are concerned;\r\nfor it pours out continually that flood of light and heat, without which\r\nlife, as we know it, would quickly become extinct upon our globe.\r\n\r\nLight and heat, though not precisely the same thing, may be regarded,\r\nhowever, as next-door neighbours. The light rays are those which\r\ndirectly affect the eye and are comprised in the visible spectrum. We\r\n_feel_ the heat rays, the chief of which are beyond the red portion of\r\nthe spectrum. They may be investigated with the _bolometer_, an\r\ninstrument invented by the late Professor Langley. Chemical rays--for\r\ninstance, those radiations which affect the photographic plate--are for\r\nthe most part also outside the visible spectrum. They are, however, at\r\nthe other end of it, namely, beyond the violet.\r\n\r\nSuch a scale of radiations may be compared to the keyboard of an\r\nimaginary piano, the sound from only one of whose octaves is audible to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe brightest light we know on the earth is dull compared with the light\r\nof the sun. It would, indeed, look quite dark if held up against it.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to arrive at a precise notion of the\r\ntemperature of the body of the sun. However, it is far in excess of any\r\ntemperature which we can obtain here, even in the most powerful electric\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nA rough idea of the solar heat may be gathered from the calculation that\r\nif the sun's surface were coated all over with a layer of ice 4000 feet\r\nthick, it would melt through this completely in one hour.\r\n\r\nThe sun cannot be a hot body merely cooling; for the rate at which it is\r\nat present giving off heat could not in such circumstances be kept up,\r\naccording to Professor Moulton, for more than 3000 years. Further, it is\r\nnot a mere burning mass, like a coal fire, for instance; as in that case\r\nabout a thousand years would show a certain drop in temperature. No\r\nperceptible diminution of solar heat having taken place within historic\r\nexperience, so far as can be ascertained, we are driven to seek some\r\nmore abstruse explanation.\r\n\r\nThe theory which seems to have received most acceptance is that put\r\nforward by Helmholtz in 1854. His idea was that gravitation produces\r\ncontinual contraction, or falling in of the outer parts of the sun; and\r\nthat this falling in, in its turn, generates enough heat to compensate\r\nfor what is being given off. The calculations of Helmholtz showed that a\r\ncontraction of about 100 feet a year from the surface towards the centre\r\nwould suffice for the purpose. In recent years, however, this estimate\r\nhas been extended to about 180 feet. Nevertheless, even with this\r\nincreased figure, the shrinkage required is so slight in comparison with\r\nthe immense girth of the sun, that it would take a continual\r\ncontraction at this rate for about 6000 years, to show even in our\r\nfinest telescopes that any change in the size of that body was taking\r\nplace at all. Upon this assumption of continuous contraction, a time\r\nshould, however, eventually be reached when the sun will have shrunk to\r\nsuch a degree of solidity, that it will not be able to shrink any\r\nfurther. Then, the loss of heat not being made up for any longer, the\r\nbody of the sun should begin to grow cold. But we need not be distressed\r\non this account; for it will take some 10,000,000 years, according to\r\nthe above theory, before the solar orb becomes too cold to support life\r\nupon our earth.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of radium it has, on the other hand, been suggested,\r\nand not unreasonably, that radio-active matter may possibly play an\r\nimportant part in keeping up the heat of the sun. But the body of\r\nscientific opinion appears to consider the theory of contraction as a\r\nresult of gravitation, which has been outlined above, to be of itself\r\nquite a sound explanation. Indeed, the late Lord Kelvin is said to have\r\nheld to the last that it was amply sufficient to account for the\r\nunderground heat of the earth, the heat of the sun, and that of all the\r\nstars in the universe.\r\n\r\nOne great difficulty in forming theories with regard to the sun, is the\r\nfact that the temperature and gravitation there are enormously in excess\r\nof anything we meet with upon our earth. The force of gravity at the\r\nsun's surface is, indeed, about twenty-seven times that at the surface\r\nof our globe.\r\n\r\nThe earth's atmosphere appears to absorb about one-half of the\r\nradiations which come to us from the sun. This absorptive effect is very\r\nnoticeable when the solar orb is low down in our sky, for its light and\r\nheat are then clearly much reduced. Of the light rays, the blue ones are\r\nthe most easily absorbed in this way; which explains why the sun looks\r\nred when near the horizon. It has then, of course, to shine through a\r\nmuch greater thickness of atmosphere than when high up in the heavens.\r\n\r\nWhat astonishes one most about the solar radiation, is the immense\r\namount of it that is apparently wasted into space in comparison with\r\nwhat falls directly upon the bodies of the solar system. Only about the\r\none-hundred-millionth is caught by all the planets together. What\r\nbecomes of the rest we cannot tell.\r\n\r\nThat brilliant white body of the sun, which we see, is enveloped by\r\nseveral layers of gases and vaporous matter, in the same manner as our\r\nglobe is enveloped by its atmosphere (see Fig. 10, p. 131). These are\r\ntransparent, just as our atmosphere is transparent; and so we see the\r\nwhite bright body of the sun right through them.\r\n\r\nThis white bright portion is called the _Photosphere_. From it comes\r\nmost of that light and heat which we see and feel. We do not know what\r\nlies under the photosphere, but, no doubt, the more solid portions of\r\nthe sun are there situated. Just above the photosphere, and lying close\r\nupon it, is a veil of smoke-like haze.\r\n\r\nNext upon this is what is known as the _Reversing Layer_, which is\r\nbetween 500 and 1000 miles in thickness. It is cooler than the\r\nunderlying photosphere, and is composed of glowing gases. Many of the\r\nelements which go to make up our earth are present in the reversing\r\nlayer in the form of vapour.\r\n\r\nThe _Chromosphere_, of which especial mention has already been made in\r\ndealing with eclipses of the sun, is another layer lying immediately\r\nupon the last one. It is between 5000 and 10,000 miles in thickness.\r\nLike the reversing layer, it is composed of glowing gases, chief among\r\nwhich is the vapour of hydrogen. The colour of the chromosphere is, in\r\nreality, a brilliant scarlet; but, as we have already said, the\r\nintensely white light of the photosphere shines through it from behind,\r\nand entirely overpowers its redness. The upper portion of the\r\nchromosphere is in violent agitation, like the waves of a stormy sea,\r\nand from it rise those red prominences which, it will be recollected,\r\nare such a notable feature in total solar eclipses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--A section through the Sun, showing how the\r\nprominences rise from the chromosphere.]\r\n\r\nThe _Corona_ lies next in order outside the chromosphere, and is, so\r\nfar as we know, the outermost of the accompaniments of the sun. This\r\nhalo of pearly-white light is irregular in outline, and fades away into\r\nthe surrounding sky. It extends outwards from the sun to several\r\nmillions of miles. As has been stated, we can never see the corona\r\nunless, when during a total solar eclipse, the moon has, for the time\r\nbeing, hidden the brilliant photosphere completely from our view.\r\n\r\nThe solar spectrum is really composed of three separate spectra\r\ncommingled, _i.e._ those of the photosphere, of the reversing layer, and\r\nof the chromosphere respectively.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the photosphere could be entirely removed, or covered up,\r\nwe should see only the spectra of those layers which lie upon it. Such a\r\nstate of things actually occurs in a total eclipse of the sun. When the\r\nmoon's body has crept across the solar disc, and hidden the last piece\r\nof photosphere, the solar spectrum suddenly becomes what is technically\r\ncalled \"reversed,\"--the dark lines crossing it changing into bright\r\nlines. This occurs because a strip of those layers which lie immediately\r\nupon the photosphere remains still uncovered. The lower of these layers\r\nhas therefore been called the \"reversing layer,\" for want of a better\r\nname. After a second or two this reversed spectrum mostly vanishes, and\r\nan altered spectrum is left to view. Taking into consideration the rate\r\nat which the moon is moving across the face of the sun, and the very\r\nshort time during which the spectrum of the reversing layer lasts, the\r\nthickness of that layer is estimated to be not more than a few hundred\r\nmiles. In the same way the last of the three spectra--namely, that of\r\nthe chromosphere--remains visible for such a time as allows us to\r\nestimate its depth at about ten times that of the reversing layer, or\r\nseveral thousand miles.\r\n\r\nWhen the chromosphere, in its turn during a total eclipse, has been\r\ncovered by the moon, the corona alone is left. This has a distinct\r\nspectrum of its own also; wherein is seen a strange line in the green\r\nportion, which does not tally with that of any element we are acquainted\r\nwith upon the earth. This unknown element has received for the time\r\nbeing the name of \"Coronium.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE SUN--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various parts of the Sun will now be treated of in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PHOTOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nThe photosphere, or \"light-sphere,\" from the Greek [phôs] (_phos_),\r\nwhich means _light_, is, as we have already said, the innermost portion\r\nof the sun which can be seen. Examined through a good telescope it shows\r\na finely mottled structure, as of brilliant granules, somewhat like rice\r\ngrains, with small dark spaces lying in between them. It has been\r\nsupposed that we have here the process of some system of circulation by\r\nwhich the sun keeps sending forth its radiations. In the bright granules\r\nwe perhaps see masses of intensely heated matter, rising from the\r\ninterior of the sun. The dark interspaces may represent matter which has\r\nbecome cooled and darkened through having parted with its heat and\r\nlight, and is falling back again into the solar furnace.\r\n\r\nThe _sun spots_, so familiar to every one nowadays, are dark patches\r\nwhich are often seen to break out in the photosphere (see Plate V., p.\r\n134). They last during various periods of time; sometimes only for a few\r\ndays, sometimes so long as a month or more. A spot is usually composed\r\nof a dark central portion called the _umbra_, and a less dark fringe\r\naround this called the _penumbra_ (see Plate VI., p. 136). The umbra\r\nordinarily has the appearance of a deep hole in the photosphere; but,\r\nthat it is a hole at all, has by no means been definitely proved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V. THE SUN, SHOWING SEVERAL GROUPS OF SPOTS\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The\r\ncross-lines seen on the disc are in no way connected with the Sun, but\r\nbelong to the telescope through which the photograph was taken.\r\n\r\n(Page 134)]\r\n\r\nSun spots are, as a rule, some thousands of miles across. The umbra of\r\na good-sized spot could indeed engulf at once many bodies the size of\r\nour earth.\r\n\r\nSun spots do not usually appear singly, but in groups. The total area of\r\na group of this kind may be of immense extent; even so great as to cover\r\nthe one-hundredth part of the whole surface of the sun. Very large\r\nspots, when such are present, may be seen without any telescope; either\r\nthrough a piece of smoked glass, or merely with the naked eye when the\r\nair is misty, or the sun low on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe umbra of a spot is not actually dark. It only appears so in contrast\r\nwith the brilliant photosphere around.\r\n\r\nSpots form, grow to a large size in comparatively short periods of time,\r\nand then quickly disappear. They seem to shrink away as a consequence of\r\nthe photosphere closing in upon them.\r\n\r\nThat the sun is rotating upon an axis, is shown by the continual change\r\nof position of all spots in one constant direction across his disc. The\r\ntime in which a spot is carried completely round depends, however, upon\r\nthe position which it occupies upon the sun's surface. A spot situated\r\nnear the equator of the sun goes round once in about twenty-five days.\r\nThe further a spot is situated from this equator, the longer it takes.\r\nAbout twenty-seven days is the time taken by a spot situated midway\r\nbetween the equator and the solar poles. Spots occur to the north of\r\nthe sun's equator, as well as to the south; though, since regular\r\nobservations have been made--that is to say, during the past fifty years\r\nor so--they appear to have broken out a little more frequently in the\r\nsouthern parts.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it will be seen that the sun does not rotate\r\nas the earth does, but that different portions appear to move at\r\ndifferent speeds. Whether in the neighbourhood of the solar poles the\r\ntime of rotation exceeds twenty-seven days we are unable to ascertain,\r\nfor spots are not seen in those regions. No explanation has yet been\r\ngiven of this peculiar rotation; and the most we can say on the subject\r\nis that the sun is not by any means a solid body.\r\n\r\n_Faculæ_ (Latin, little torches) are brilliant patches which appear here\r\nand there upon the sun's surface, and are in some way associated with\r\nspots. Their displacement, too, across the solar face confirms the\r\nevidence which the spots give us of the sun's rotation.\r\n\r\nOur proofs of this rotation are still further strengthened by the\r\nDoppler spectroscopic method of observation alluded to in Chapter XI. As\r\nwas then stated, one edge of the sun is thus found to be continually\r\napproaching us, and the other side continually receding from us. The\r\nvarying rates of rotation, which the spots and faculæ give us, are duly\r\nconfirmed by this method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI. PHOTOGRAPH OF A SUNSPOT\r\n\r\nThis fine picture was taken by the late M. Janssen. The granular\r\nstructure of the Sun's surface is here well represented. (From\r\n_Knowledge_.)\r\n\r\n(Page 135)]\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to bring some regularity into the question of\r\nsunspots was the discovery by Schwabe, in 1852, that they were subject\r\nto a regular variation. As a matter of fact they wax and wane in their\r\nnumber, and the total area which they cover, in the course of a period,\r\nor cycle, of on an average about 11-1/4 years; being at one part of this\r\nperiod large and abundant, and at another few and small. This period of\r\n11-1/4 years is known as the sun spot cycle. No explanation has yet been\r\ngiven of the curious round of change, but the period in question seems\r\nto govern most of the phenomena connected with the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. REVERSING LAYER.\r\n\r\nThis is a layer of relatively cool gases lying immediately upon the\r\nphotosphere. We never see it directly; and the only proof we have of its\r\npresence is that remarkable reversal of the spectrum already described,\r\nwhen during an instant or two in a total eclipse, the advancing edge of\r\nthe moon, having just hidden the brilliant photosphere, is moving across\r\nthe fine strip which the layer then presents edgewise towards us. The\r\nfleeting moments during which this reversed spectrum lasts, informs us\r\nthat the layer is comparatively shallow; little more indeed than about\r\n500 miles in depth.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of the reversing layer, or \"flash spectrum,\" as it is\r\nsometimes called on account of the instantaneous character with which\r\nthe change takes place, was, as we have seen, first noticed by Young in\r\n1870; and has been successfully photographed since then during several\r\neclipses. The layer itself appears to be in a fairly quiescent state; a\r\nmarked contrast to the seething photosphere beneath, and the agitated\r\nchromosphere above.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE CHROMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nThe Chromosphere--so called from the Greek [chrôma] (_chroma_), which\r\nsignifies _colour_--is a layer of gases lying immediately upon the\r\npreceding one. Its thickness is, however, plainly much the greater of\r\nthe two; for whereas the reversing layer is only revealed to us\r\n_indirectly_ by the spectroscope, a portion of the chromosphere may\r\nclearly be _seen_ in a total eclipse in the form of a strip of scarlet\r\nlight. The time which the moon's edge takes to traverse it tells us that\r\nit must be about ten times as deep as the reversing layer, namely, from\r\n5000 to 10,000 miles in depth. Its spectrum shows that it is composed\r\nchiefly of hydrogen, calcium and helium, in the state of vapour. Its red\r\ncolour is mainly due to glowing hydrogen. The element helium, which it\r\nalso contains, has received its appellation from [hêlios] (_helios_),\r\nthe Greek name for the sun; because, at the time when it first attracted\r\nattention, there appeared to be no element corresponding to it upon our\r\nearth, and it was consequently imagined to be confined to the sun alone.\r\nSir William Ramsay, however, discovered it to be also a terrestrial\r\nelement in 1895, and since then it has come into much prominence as one\r\nof the products given off by radium.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the excessive force of gravity on the sun, one\r\nwould expect to find the chromosphere and reversing layer growing\r\ngradually thicker in the direction of the photosphere. This, however, is\r\nnot the case. Both these layers are strangely enough of the same\r\ndensities all through; which makes it suspected that, in these regions,\r\nthe force of gravity may be counteracted by some other force or forces,\r\nexerting a powerful pressure outwards from the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE PROMINENCES.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, in dealing with total eclipses, that the exterior\r\nsurface of the chromosphere is agitated like a stormy sea, and from it\r\nbillows of flame are tossed up to gigantic heights. These flaming jets\r\nare known under the name of prominences, because they were first noticed\r\nin the form of brilliant points projecting from behind the rim of the\r\nmoon when the sun was totally eclipsed. Prominences are of two kinds,\r\n_eruptive_ and _quiescent_. The eruptive prominences spurt up directly\r\nfrom the chromosphere with immense speeds, and change their shape with\r\ngreat rapidity. Quiescent prominences, on the other hand, have a form\r\nsomewhat like trees, and alter their shape but slowly. In the eruptive\r\nprominences glowing masses of gas are shot up to altitudes sometimes as\r\nhigh as 300,000 miles,[10] with velocities even so great as from 500 to\r\n600 miles a second. It has been noticed that the eruptive prominences\r\nare mostly found in those portions of the sun where spots usually\r\nappear, namely, in the regions near the solar equator. The quiescent\r\nprominences, on the other hand, are confined, as a rule, to the\r\nneighbourhood of the sun's poles.\r\n\r\nProminences were at first never visible except during total eclipses of\r\nthe sun. But in the year 1868, as we have already seen, a method of\r\nemploying the spectroscope was devised, by means of which they could be\r\nobserved and studied at any time, without the necessity of waiting for\r\nan eclipse.\r\n\r\nA still further development of the spectroscope, the\r\n_Spectroheliograph_, an instrument invented almost simultaneously by\r\nProfessor Hale and the French astronomer, M. Deslandres, permits of\r\nphotographs being taken of the sun, with the light emanating from _only\r\none_ of its glowing gases at a time. For instance, we can thus obtain a\r\nrecord of what the glowing hydrogen alone is doing on the solar body at\r\nany particular moment. With this instrument it is also possible to\r\nobtain a series of photographs, showing what is taking place upon the\r\nsun at various levels. This is very useful in connection with the study\r\nof the spots; for we are, in consequence, enabled to gather more\r\nevidence on the subject of their actual form than is given us by their\r\nhighly foreshortened appearances when observed directly in the\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. CORONA. (Latin, _a Crown_.)\r\n\r\nThis marvellous halo of pearly-white light, which displays itself to our\r\nview only during the total phase of an eclipse of the sun, is by no\r\nmeans a layer like those other envelopments of the sun of which we have\r\njust been treating. It appears, on the other hand, to be composed of\r\nfilmy matter, radiating outwards in every direction, and fading away\r\ngradually into space. Its structure is noted to bear a strong\r\nresemblance to the tails of comets, or the streamers of the aurora\r\nborealis.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge concerning the corona has, however, advanced very slowly.\r\nWe have not, so far, been as fortunate with regard to it as with regard\r\nto the prominences; and, for all we can gather concerning it, we are\r\nstill entirely dependent upon the changes and chances of total solar\r\neclipses. All attempts, in fact, to apply the spectroscopic method, so\r\nas to observe the corona at leisure in full sunlight in the way in which\r\nthe prominences can be observed, have up to the present met with\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThe general form under which the corona appears to our eyes varies\r\nmarkedly at different eclipses. Sometimes its streamers are many, and\r\nradiate all round; at other times they are confined only to the middle\r\nportions of the sun, and are very elongated, with short feathery-looking\r\nwisps adorning the solar poles. It is noticed that this change of shape\r\nvaries in close accordance with that 11-1/4 year period during which the\r\nsun spots wax and wane; the many-streamered regular type corresponding\r\nto the time of great sunspot activity, while the irregular type with the\r\nlong streamers is present only when the spots are few (see Plate VII.,\r\np. 142). Streamers have often been noted to issue from those regions of\r\nthe sun where active prominences are at the moment in existence; but it\r\ncannot be laid down that this is always the case.\r\n\r\nNo hypothesis has yet been formulated which will account for the\r\nstructure of the corona, or for its variation in shape. The great\r\ndifficulty with regard to theorising upon this subject, is the fact\r\nthat we see so much of the corona under conditions of marked\r\nforeshortening. Assuming, what indeed seems natural, that the rays of\r\nwhich it is composed issue in every direction from the solar body, in a\r\nmanner which may be roughly imitated by sticking pins all over a ball;\r\nit is plainly impossible to form any definite idea concerning streamers,\r\nwhich actually may owe most of the shape they present to us, to the\r\nmixing up of multitudes of rays at all kinds of angles to the line of\r\nsight. In a word, we have to try and form an opinion concerning an\r\narrangement which, broadly speaking, is _spherical_, but which, on\r\naccount of its distance, must needs appear to us as absolutely _flat_.\r\n\r\nThe most known about the composition of the corona is that it is made up\r\nof particles of matter, mingled with a glowing gas. It is an element in\r\nthe composition of this gas which, as has been stated, is not found to\r\ntally with any known terrestrial element, and has, therefore, received\r\nthe name of coronium for want of a better designation.\r\n\r\nOne definite conclusion appears to be reached with regard to the corona,\r\n_i.e._ that the matter of which it is composed, must be exceedingly\r\nrarefied; as it is not found, for instance, to retard appreciably the\r\nspeed of comets, on occasions when these bodies pass very close to the\r\nsun. A calculation has indeed been made which would tend to show that\r\nthe particles composing the coronal matter, are separated from each\r\nother by a distance of perhaps between two and three yards! The density\r\nof the corona is found not to increase inwards towards the sun. This is\r\nwhat has already been noted with regard to the layers lying beneath it.\r\nPowerful forces, acting in opposition to gravity, must hold sway here\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (A.) THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OF DECEMBER 22ND, 1870\r\n\r\nDrawn by Mr. W.H. Wesley from a photograph taken at Syracuse by Mr.\r\nBrothers. This is the type of corona seen at the time of _greatest_\r\nsunspot activity. The coronas of 1882 (Plate I., p. 96) and of 1905\r\n(Frontispiece) are of the same type.\r\n\r\n(B.) THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OF MAY 28TH, 1900\r\n\r\nDrawn by Mr. W.H. Wesley from photographs taken by Mr. E.W.

FORMS OF THE SOLAR CORONA AT THE EPOCHS OF SUNSPOT MAXIMUM\r\nAND SUNSPOT MINIMUM, RESPECTIVELY\r\n\r\n(Page 141)]\r\n\r\nThe 11-1/4 year period, during which the sun spots vary in number and\r\nsize, appears to govern the activities of the sun much in the same way\r\nthat our year does the changing seasonal conditions of our earth. Not\r\nonly, as we have seen, does the corona vary its shape in accordance with\r\nthe said period, but the activity of the prominences, and of the faculæ,\r\nfollow suit. Further, this constant round of ebb and flow is not\r\nconfined to the sun itself, but, strangely enough, affects the earth\r\nalso. The displays of the aurora borealis, which we experience here,\r\ncoincide closely with it, as does also the varying state of the earth's\r\nmagnetism. The connection may be still better appreciated when a great\r\nspot, or group of spots, has made its appearance upon the sun. It has,\r\nfor example, often been noted that when the solar rotation carries a\r\nspot, or group of spots, across the middle of the visible surface of the\r\nsun, our magnetic and electrical arrangements are disturbed for the time\r\nbeing. The magnetic needles in our observatories are, for instance, seen\r\nto oscillate violently, telegraphic communication is for a while upset,\r\nand magnificent displays of the aurora borealis illumine our night\r\nskies. Mr. E.W. Maunder, of Greenwich Observatory, who has made a very\r\ncareful investigation of this subject, suspects that, when elongated\r\ncoronal streamers are whirled round in our direction by the solar\r\nrotation, powerful magnetic impulses may be projected upon us at the\r\nmoments when such streamers are pointing towards the earth.\r\n\r\nSome interesting investigations with regard to sunspots have recently\r\nbeen published by Mrs. E.W. Maunder. In an able paper, communicated to\r\nthe Royal Astronomical Society on May 10, 1907, she reviews the\r\nGreenwich Observatory statistics dealing with the number and extent of\r\nthe spots which have appeared during the period from 1889 to 1901--a\r\nwhole sunspot cycle. From a detailed study of the dates in question, she\r\nfinds that the number of those spots which are formed on the side of the\r\nsun turned away from us, and die out upon the side turned towards us, is\r\nmuch greater than the number of those which are formed on the side\r\nturned towards us and die out upon the side turned away. It used, for\r\ninstance, to be considered that the influence of a planet might\r\n_produce_ sunspots; but these investigations make it look rather as if\r\nsome influence on the part of the earth tends, on the contrary, to\r\n_extinguish_ them. Mrs. Maunder, so far, prefers to call the influence\r\nthus traced an _apparent_ influence only, for, as she very fairly points\r\nout, it seems difficult to attribute a real influence in this matter to\r\nthe earth, which is so small a thing in comparison not only with the\r\nsun, but even with many individual spots.\r\n\r\nThe above investigation was to a certain degree anticipated by Mr. Henry\r\nCorder in 1895; but Mrs. Maunder's researches cover a much longer\r\nperiod, and the conclusions deduced are of a wider and more defined\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWith regard to its chemical composition, the spectroscope shows us that\r\nthirty-nine of the elements which are found upon our earth are also to\r\nbe found in the sun. Of these the best known are hydrogen, oxygen,\r\nhelium, carbon, calcium, aluminium, iron, copper, zinc, silver, tin, and\r\nlead. Some elements of the metallic order have, however, not been found\r\nthere, as, for instance, gold and mercury; while a few of the other\r\nclass of element, such as nitrogen, chlorine, and sulphur, are also\r\nabsent. It must not, indeed, be concluded that the elements apparently\r\nmissing do not exist at all in the solar body. Gold and mercury have, in\r\nconsequence of their great atomic weight, perhaps sunk away into the\r\ncentre. Again, the fact that we cannot find traces of certain other\r\nelements, is no real proof of their entire absence. Some of them may,\r\nfor instance, be resolved into even simpler forms, under the unusual\r\nconditions which exist in the sun; and so we are unable to trace them\r\nwith the spectroscope, the experience of which rests on laboratory\r\nexperiments conducted, at best, in conditions which obtain upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] On November 15, 1907, Dr. A. Rambaut, Radcliffe Observer at Oxford\r\nUniversity, noted a prominence which rose to a height of 324,600 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE INFERIOR PLANETS\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting from the centre of the solar system, the first body we meet\r\nwith is the planet Mercury. It circulates at an average distance from\r\nthe sun of about thirty-six millions of miles. The next body to it is\r\nthe planet Venus, at about sixty-seven millions of miles, namely, about\r\ndouble the distance of Mercury from the sun. Since our earth comes next\r\nagain, astronomers call those planets which circulate within its orbit,\r\n_i.e._ Mercury and Venus, the Inferior Planets, while those which\r\ncirculate outside it they call the Superior Planets.[11]\r\n\r\nIn studying the inferior planets, the circumstances in which we make our\r\nobservations are so very similar with regard to each, that it is best to\r\ntake them together. Let us begin by considering the various positions of\r\nan inferior planet, as seen from the earth, during the course of its\r\njourneys round the sun. When furthest from us it is at the other side of\r\nthe sun, and cannot then be seen owing to the blaze of light. As it\r\ncontinues its journey it passes to the left of the sun, and is then\r\nsufficiently away from the glare to be plainly seen. It next draws in\r\nagain towards the sun, and is once more lost to view in the blaze at\r\nthe time of its passing nearest to us. Then it gradually comes out to\r\nview on the right hand, separates from the sun up to a certain distance\r\nas before, and again recedes beyond the sun, and is for the time being\r\nonce more lost to view.\r\n\r\nTo these various positions technical names are given. When the inferior\r\nplanet is on the far side of the sun from us, it is said to be in\r\n_Superior Conjunction_. When it has drawn as far as it can to the left\r\nhand, and is then as east as possible of the sun, it is said to be at\r\nits _Greatest Eastern Elongation_. Again, when it is passing nearest to\r\nus, it is said to be in _Inferior Conjunction_; and, finally, when it\r\nhas drawn as far as it can to the right hand, it is spoken of as being\r\nat its _Greatest Western Elongation_ (see Fig. 11, p. 148).\r\n\r\nThe continual variation in the distance of an interior planet from us,\r\nduring its revolution around the sun, will of course be productive of\r\ngreat alterations in its apparent size. At superior conjunction it\r\nought, being then farthest away, to show the smallest disc; while at\r\ninferior conjunction, being the nearest, it should look much larger.\r\nWhen at greatest elongation, whether eastern or western, it should\r\nnaturally present an appearance midway in size between the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Various positions, and illumination by the Sun, of an\r\nInferior Planet in the course of its orbit.\r\n\r\nCorresponding views of the same situations of an Inferior Planet as seen\r\nfrom the Earth, showing consequent phases and alterations in apparent\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nFIG. 11.--Orbit and Phases of an Inferior Planet.]\r\n\r\nFrom the above considerations one would be inclined to assume that the\r\nbest time for studying the surface of an interior planet with the\r\ntelescope is when it is at inferior conjunction, or, nearest to us. But\r\nthat this is not the case will at once appear if we consider that the\r\nsunlight is then falling upon the side away from us, leaving the side\r\nwhich is towards us unillumined. In superior conjunction, on the other\r\nhand, the light falls full upon the side of the planet facing us; but\r\nthe disc is then so small-looking, and our view besides is so dazzled by\r\nthe proximity of the sun, that observations are of little avail. In the\r\nelongations, however, the sunlight comes from the side, and so we see\r\none half of the planet lit up; the right half at eastern elongation, and\r\nthe left half at western elongation. Piecing together the results given\r\nus at these more favourable views, we are enabled, bit by bit, to gather\r\nsome small knowledge concerning the surface of an inferior planet.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it will be seen at once that the inferior\r\nplanets show various phases comparable to the waxing and waning of our\r\nmoon in its monthly round. Superior conjunction is, in fact, similar to\r\nfull moon, and inferior conjunction to new moon; while the eastern and\r\nwestern elongations may be compared respectively to the moon's first and\r\nlast quarters. It will be recollected how, when these phases were first\r\nseen by the early telescopic observers, the Copernican theory was felt\r\nto be immensely strengthened; for it had been pointed out that if this\r\nsystem were the correct one, the planets Venus and Mercury, were it\r\npossible to see them more distinctly, would of necessity present phases\r\nlike these when viewed from the earth. It should here be noted that the\r\ntelescope was not invented until nearly seventy years after the death of\r\nCopernicus.\r\n\r\nThe apparent swing of an inferior planet from side to side of the sun,\r\nat one time on the east side, then passing into and lost in the sun's\r\nrays to appear once more on the west side, is the explanation of what is\r\nmeant when we speak of an _evening_ or a _morning star_. An inferior\r\nplanet is called an evening star when it is at its eastern elongation,\r\nthat is to say, on the left-hand of the sun; for, being then on the\r\neastern side, it will set after the sun sets, as both sink in their turn\r\nbelow the western horizon at the close of day. Similarly, when such a\r\nplanet is at its western elongation, that is to say, to the right-hand\r\nof the sun, it will go in advance of him, and so will rise above the\r\neastern horizon before the sun rises, receiving therefore the\r\ndesignation of morning star. In very early times, however, before any\r\ndefinite ideas had been come to with regard to the celestial motions, it\r\nwas generally believed that the morning and evening stars were quite\r\ndistinct bodies. Thus Venus, when a morning star, was known to the\r\nancients under the name of Phosphorus, or Lucifer; whereas they called\r\nit Hesperus when it was an evening star.\r\n\r\nSince an inferior planet circulates between us and the sun, one would be\r\ninclined to expect that such a body, each time it passed on the side\r\nnearest to the earth, should be seen as a black spot against the bright\r\nsolar disc. Now this would most certainly be the case were the orbit of\r\nan inferior planet in the same plane with the orbit of the earth. But we\r\nhave already seen how the orbits in the solar system, whether those of\r\nplanets or of satellites, are by no means in the one plane; and that it\r\nis for this very reason that the moon is able to pass time after time in\r\nthe direction of the sun, at the epoch known as new moon, and yet not to\r\neclipse him save after the lapse of several such passages. Transits,\r\nthen, as the passages of an inferior planet across the sun's disc are\r\ncalled, take place, for the same reason, only after certain regular\r\nlapses of time; and, as regards the circumstances of their occurrence,\r\nare on a par with eclipses of the sun. The latter, however, happen much\r\nmore frequently, because the moon passes in the neighbourhood of the\r\nsun, roughly speaking, once a month, whereas Venus comes to each\r\ninferior conjunction at intervals so long apart as a year and a half,\r\nand Mercury only about every four months. From this it will be further\r\ngathered that transits of Mercury take place much oftener than transits\r\nof Venus.\r\n\r\nUntil recent years _Transits of Venus_ were phenomena of great\r\nimportance to astronomers, for they furnished the best means then\r\navailable of calculating the distance of the sun from the earth. This\r\nwas arrived at through comparing the amount of apparent displacement in\r\nthe planet's path across the solar disc, when the transit was observed\r\nfrom widely separated stations on the earth's surface. The last transit\r\nof Venus took place in 1882, and there will not be another until the\r\nyear 2004.\r\n\r\n_Transits of Mercury_, on the other hand, are not of much scientific\r\nimportance. They are of no interest as a popular spectacle; for the\r\ndimensions of the planet are so small, that it can be seen only with the\r\naid of a telescope when it is in the act of crossing the sun's disc. The\r\nlast transit of Mercury took place on November 14, 1907, and there will\r\nbe another on November 6, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe first person known to have observed a transit of an inferior planet\r\nwas the celebrated French philosopher, Gassendi. This was the transit of\r\nMercury which took place on the 7th of December 1631.\r\n\r\nThe first time a transit of Venus was ever seen, so far as is known, was\r\non the 24th of November 1639. The observer was a certain Jeremiah\r\nHorrox, curate of Hoole, near Preston, in Lancashire. The transit in\r\nquestion commenced shortly before sunset, and his observations in\r\nconsequence were limited to only about half-an-hour. Horrox happened to\r\nhave a great friend, one William Crabtree, of Manchester, whom he had\r\nadvised by letter to be on the look out for the phenomenon. The weather\r\nin Crabtree's neighbourhood was cloudy, with the result that he only got\r\na view of the transit for about ten minutes before the sun set.\r\n\r\nThat this transit was observed at all is due entirely to the remarkable\r\nability of Horrox. According to the calculations of the great Kepler, no\r\ntransit could take place that year (1639), as the planet would just pass\r\nclear of the lower edge of the sun. Horrox, however, not being satisfied\r\nwith this, worked the question out for himself, and came to the\r\nconclusion that the planet would _actually_ traverse the lower portion\r\nof the sun's disc. The event, as we have seen, proved him to be quite in\r\nthe right. Horrox is said to have been a veritable prodigy of\r\nastronomical skill; and had he lived longer would, no doubt, have become\r\nvery famous. Unfortunately he died about two years after his celebrated\r\ntransit, in his _twenty-second_ year only, according to the accounts.\r\nHis friend Crabtree, who was then also a young man, is said to have been\r\nkilled at the battle of Naseby in 1645.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting phenomenon in connection with transits which is\r\nknown as the \"Black Drop.\" When an inferior planet has just made its way\r\non to the face of the sun, it is usually seen to remain for a short time\r\nas if attached to the sun's edge by what looks like a dark ligament (see\r\nFig. 12, p. 153). This gives to the planet for the time being an\r\nelongated appearance, something like that of a pear; but when the\r\nligament, which all the while keeps getting thinner and thinner, has at\r\nlast broken, the black body of the planet is seen to stand out round\r\nagainst the solar disc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--The \"Black Drop.\"]\r\n\r\nThis appearance may be roughly compared to the manner in which a drop of\r\nliquid (or, preferably, of some glutinous substance) tends for a while\r\nto adhere to an object from which it is falling.\r\n\r\nWhen the planet is in turn making its way off the face of the sun, the\r\nligament is again seen to form and to attach it to the sun's edge before\r\nits due time.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the black drop, or ligament, is entirely an illusion,\r\nand, broadly speaking, of an optical origin. Something very similar will\r\nbe noticed if one brings one's thumb and forefinger _slowly_ together\r\nagainst a very bright background.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar phenomenon has proved one of the greatest drawbacks to the\r\nproper observation of transits, for it is quite impossible to note the\r\nexact instant of the planet's entrance upon and departure from the solar\r\ndisc in conditions such as these.\r\n\r\nThe black drop seems to bear a family resemblance, so to speak, to the\r\nphenomenon of Baily's beads. In the latter instance the lunar peaks, as\r\nthey approach the sun's edge, appear to lengthen out in a similar manner\r\nand bridge the intervening space before their time, thus giving\r\nprominence to an effect which otherwise should scarcely be noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe last transit of Mercury, which, as has been already stated, took\r\nplace on November 14, 1907, was not successfully observed by astronomers\r\nin England, on account of the cloudiness of the weather. In France,\r\nhowever, Professor Moye, of Montpellier, saw it under good conditions,\r\nand mentions that the black drop remained very conspicuous for fully a\r\nminute. The transit was also observed in the United States, the reports\r\nfrom which speak of the black drop as very \"troublesome.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of transits it should be mentioned that it\r\nwas in the capacity of commander of an expedition to Otaheite, in the\r\nPacific, to observe the transit of Venus of June 3, 1769, that Captain\r\nCook embarked upon the first of his celebrated voyages.\r\n\r\nIn studying the surfaces of Venus and Mercury with the telescope,\r\nobservers are, needless to say, very much hindered by the proximity of\r\nthe sun. Venus, when at the greatest elongations, certainly draws some\r\ndistance out of the glare; but her surface is, even then, so dazzlingly\r\nbright, that the markings upon it are difficult to see. Mercury, on the\r\nother hand, is much duller in contrast, but the disc it shows in the\r\ntelescope is exceedingly small; and, in addition, when that planet is\r\nleft above the horizon for a short time after sunset, as necessarily\r\nhappens after certain intervals, the mists near the earth's surface\r\nrender observation of it very difficult.\r\n\r\nUntil about twenty-five years ago, it was generally believed that both\r\nthese planets rotated on their axes in about twenty-four hours, a\r\nnotion, no doubt, originally founded upon an unconscious desire to bring\r\nthem into some conformity with our earth. But Schiaparelli, observing in\r\nItaly, and Percival Lowell, in the clear skies of Arizona and Mexico,\r\nhave lately come to the conclusion that both planets rotate upon their\r\naxes in the same time as they revolve in their orbits,[12] the result\r\nbeing that they turn one face ever towards the sun in the same manner\r\nthat the moon turns one face ever towards the earth--a curious state of\r\nthings, which will be dealt with more fully when we come to treat of our\r\nsatellite.\r\n\r\nThe marked difference in the brightness between the two planets has\r\nalready been alluded to. The surface of Venus is, indeed, about five\r\ntimes as bright as that of Mercury. The actual brightness of Mercury is\r\nabout equivalent to that of our moon, and astronomers are, therefore,\r\ninclined to think that it may resemble her in having a very rugged\r\nsurface and practically no atmosphere. This probable lack of atmosphere\r\nis further corroborated by two circumstances. One of these is that when\r\nMercury is just about to transit the face of the sun, no ring of\r\ndiffused light is seen to encircle its disc as would be the case if it\r\npossessed an atmosphere. Such a lack of atmosphere is, indeed, only to\r\nbe expected from what is known as the _Kinetic Theory of Gases_.\r\nAccording to this theory, which is based upon the behaviour of various\r\nkinds of gas, it is found that these elements tend to escape into space\r\nfrom the surface of bodies whose force of gravitation is weak. Hydrogen\r\ngas, for example, tends to fly away from our earth, as any one may see\r\nfor himself when a balloon rises into the air. The gravitation of the\r\nearth seems, however, powerful enough to hold down other gases, as, for\r\ninstance, those of which the air is chiefly composed, namely, oxygen and\r\nnitrogen. In due accordance with the Kinetic theory, we find the moon\r\nand Mercury, which are much about the same size, destitute of\r\natmospheres. Mars, too, whose diameter is only about double that of the\r\nmoon, has very little atmosphere. We find, on the other hand, that\r\nVenus, which is about the same size as our earth, clearly possesses an\r\natmosphere, as just before the planet is in transit across the sun, the\r\noutline of its dark body is seen to be surrounded by a bright ring of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe results of telescopic observation show that more markings are\r\nvisible on Mercury than on Venus. The intense brilliancy of Venus is,\r\nindeed, about the same as that of our white clouds when the sun is\r\nshining directly upon them. It has, therefore, been supposed that the\r\nplanet is thickly enveloped in cloud, and that we do not ever see any\r\npart of its surface, except perchance the summit of some lofty mountain\r\nprojecting through the fleecy mass.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the great brilliancy of Venus, it may be mentioned that\r\nshe has frequently been seen in England, with the naked eye in full\r\nsunshine, when at the time of her greatest brightness. The writer has\r\nseen her thus at noonday. Needless to say, the sky at the moment was\r\nintensely blue and clear.\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Mercury is very oval, and much more so than that of any\r\nother planet. The consequence is that, when Mercury is nearest to the\r\nsun, the heat which it receives is twice as great as when it is farthest\r\naway. The orbit of Venus, on the other hand, is in marked contrast with\r\nthat of Mercury, and is, besides, more nearly of a circular shape than\r\nthat of any of the other planets. Venus, therefore, always keeps about\r\nthe same distance from the sun, and so the heat which she receives\r\nduring the course of her year can only be subject to very slight\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] In employing the terms Inferior and Superior the writer bows to\r\nastronomical custom, though he cannot help feeling that, in the\r\ncircumstances, Interior and Exterior would be much more appropriate.\r\n\r\n[12] This question is, however, uncertain, for some very recent\r\nspectroscopic observations of Venus seem to show a rotation period of\r\nabout twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (in Chapter I.) how, in very early times, men\r\nnaturally enough considered the earth to be a flat plane extending to a\r\nvery great distance in every direction; but that, as years went on,\r\ncertain of the Greek philosophers suspected it to be a sphere. One or\r\ntwo of the latter are, indeed, said to have further believed in its\r\nrotation about an axis, and even in its revolution around the sun; but,\r\nas the ideas in question were founded upon fancy, rather than upon any\r\ndirect evidence, they did not generally attract attention. The small\r\neffect, therefore, which these theories had upon astronomy, may well be\r\ngathered from the fact that in the Ptolemaic system the earth was\r\nconsidered as fixed and at the centre of things; and this belief, as we\r\nhave seen, continued unaltered down to the days of Copernicus. It was,\r\nindeed, quite impossible to be certain of the real shape of the earth or\r\nthe reality of its motions until knowledge became more extended and\r\nscientific instruments much greater in precision.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider in detail a few of the more obvious arguments which\r\ncan be put forward to show that our earth is a sphere.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, the earth were a plane surface, a ship sailing away\r\nfrom us over the sea would appear to grow smaller and smaller as it\r\nreceded into the distance, becoming eventually a tiny speck, and fading\r\ngradually from our view. This, however, is not at all what actually\r\ntakes place. As we watch a vessel receding, its hull appears bit by bit\r\nto slip gently down over the horizon, leaving the masts alone visible.\r\nThen, in their turn, the masts are seen to slip down in the same manner,\r\nuntil eventually every trace of the vessel is gone. On the other hand,\r\nwhen a ship comes into view, the masts are the first portions to appear.\r\nThey gradually rise up from below the horizon, and the hull follows in\r\nits turn, until the whole vessel is visible. Again, when one is upon a\r\nship at sea, a set of masts will often be seen sticking up alone above\r\nthe horizon, and these may shorten and gradually disappear from view\r\nwithout the body of the ship to which they belong becoming visible at\r\nall. Since one knows from experience that there is no _edge_ at the\r\nhorizon over which a vessel can drop down, the appearance which we have\r\nbeen describing can only be explained by supposing that the surface of\r\nthe earth is always curving gradually in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe distance at which what is known as the _horizon_ lies away from us\r\ndepends entirely upon the height above the earth's surface where we\r\nhappen at the moment to be. A ship which has appeared to sink below the\r\nhorizon for a person standing on the beach, will be found to come back\r\nagain into view if he at once ascends a high hill. Experiment shows that\r\nthe horizon line lies at about three miles away for a person standing at\r\nthe water's edge. The curving of the earth's surface is found, indeed,\r\nto be at the rate of eight inches in every mile. Now it can be\r\nascertained, by calculation, that a body curving at this rate in every\r\ndirection must be a globe about 8000 miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nAgain, the fact that, if not stopped by such insuperable obstacles as\r\nthe polar ice and snow, those who travel continually in any one\r\ndirection upon the earth's surface always find themselves back again at\r\nthe regions from which they originally set out, is additional ground for\r\nconcluding that the earth is a globe.\r\n\r\nWe can find still further evidence. For instance, in an eclipse of the\r\nmoon the earth's shadow, when seen creeping across the moon's face, is\r\nnoted to be _always_ circular in shape. One cannot imagine how such a\r\nthing could take place unless the earth were a sphere.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is found from observation that the sun, the planets, and the\r\nsatellites are, all of them, round. This roundness cannot be the\r\nroundness of a flat plate, for instance, for then the objects in\r\nquestion would sometimes present their thin sides to our view. It\r\nhappens, also, that upon the discs which these bodies show, we see\r\ncertain markings shifting along continually in one direction, to\r\ndisappear at one side and to reappear again at the other. Such bodies\r\nmust, indeed, be spheres in rotation.\r\n\r\nThe crescent and other phases, shown by the moon and the inferior\r\nplanets, should further impress the truth of the matter upon us, as such\r\nappearances can only be caused by the sunlight falling from various\r\ndirections upon the surfaces of spherical bodies.\r\n\r\nAnother proof, perhaps indeed the weightiest of all, is the continuous\r\nmanner in which the stars overhead give place to others as one travels\r\nabout the surface of the earth. When in northern regions the Pole Star\r\nand its neighbours--the stars composing the Plough, for instance--are\r\nover our heads. As one journeys south these gradually sink towards the\r\nnorthern horizon, while other stars take their place, and yet others are\r\nuncovered to view from the south. The regularity with which these\r\nchanges occur shows that every point on the earth's surface faces a\r\ndifferent direction of the sky, and such an arrangement would only be\r\npossible if the earth were a sphere. The celebrated Greek philosopher,\r\nAristotle, is known to have believed in the globular shape of the earth,\r\nand it was by this very argument that he had convinced himself that it\r\nwas so.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the sphericity of the earth does not appear, however, to\r\nhave been generally accepted until the voyages of the great navigators\r\nshowed that it could be sailed round.\r\n\r\nThe next point we have to consider is the rotation of the earth about\r\nits axis. From the earliest times men noticed that the sky and\r\neverything in it appeared to revolve around the earth in one fixed\r\ndirection, namely, towards what is called the West, and that it made one\r\ncomplete revolution in the period of time which we know as twenty-four\r\nhours. The stars were seen to come up, one after another, from below the\r\neastern horizon, to mount the sky, and then to sink in turn below the\r\nwestern horizon. The sun was seen to perform exactly the same journey,\r\nand the moon, too, whenever she was visible. One or two of the ancient\r\nGreek philosophers perceived that this might be explained, either by a\r\nmovement of the entire heavens around the earth, or by a turning motion\r\non the part of the earth itself. Of these diverse explanations, that\r\nwhich supposed an actual movement of the heavens appealed to them the\r\nmost, for they could hardly conceive that the earth should continually\r\nrotate and men not be aware of its movement. The question may be\r\ncompared to what we experience when borne along in a railway train. We\r\nsee the telegraph posts and the trees and buildings near the line fly\r\npast us one after another in the contrary direction. Either these must\r\nbe moving, or we must be moving; and as we happen to _know_ that it is,\r\nindeed, we who are moving, there can be no question therefore about the\r\nmatter. But it would not be at all so easy to be sure of this movement\r\nwere one unable to see the objects close at hand displacing themselves.\r\nFor instance, if one is shut up in a railway carriage at night with the\r\nblinds down, there is really nothing to show that one is moving, except\r\nthe jolting of the train. And even then it is hard to be sure in which\r\ndirection one is actually travelling.\r\n\r\nThe way we are situated upon the earth is therefore as follows. There\r\nare no other bodies sufficiently near to be seen flying past us in turn;\r\nour earth spins without a jolt; we and all things around us, including\r\nthe atmosphere itself, are borne along together with precisely the same\r\nimpetus, just as all the objects scattered about a railway carriage\r\nshare in the forward movement of the train. Such being the case, what\r\nwonder that we are unconscious of the earth's rotation, of which we\r\nshould know nothing at all, were it not for that slow displacement of\r\nthe distant objects in the heavens, as we are borne past them in turn.\r\n\r\nIf the night sky be watched, it will be soon found that its apparent\r\nturning movement seems to take place around a certain point, which\r\nappears as if fixed. This point is known as the north pole of the\r\nheavens; and a rather bright star, which is situated very close to this\r\nhub of movement, is in consequence called the Pole Star. For the\r\ndwellers in southern latitudes there is also a point in their sky which\r\nappears to remain similarly fixed, and this is known as the south pole\r\nof the heavens. Since, however, the heavens do not turn round at all,\r\nbut the earth does, it will easily be seen that these apparently\r\nstationary regions in the sky are really the points towards which the\r\naxis of the earth is directed. The positions on the earth's surface\r\nitself, known as the North and South Poles, are merely the places where\r\nthe earth's axis, if there were actually such a thing, would be expected\r\nto jut out. The north pole of the earth will thus be situated exactly\r\nbeneath the north pole of the heavens, and the south pole of the earth\r\nexactly beneath the south pole of the heavens.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the earth rotates upon its imaginary axis once in\r\nabout every twenty-four hours. This means that everything upon the\r\nsurface of the earth is carried round once during that time. The\r\nmeasurement around the earth's equator is about 24,000 miles; and,\r\ntherefore, an object situated at the equator must be carried round\r\nthrough a distance of about 24,000 miles in each twenty-four hours.\r\nEverything at the equator is thus moving along at the rapid rate of\r\nabout 1000 miles an hour, or between sixteen and seventeen times as\r\nfast as an express train. If, however, one were to take measurements\r\naround the earth parallel to the equator, one would find these\r\nmeasurements becoming less and less, according as the poles were\r\napproached. It is plain, therefore, that the speed with which any point\r\nmoves, in consequence of the earth's rotation, will be greatest at the\r\nequator, and less and less in the direction of the poles; while at the\r\npoles themselves there will be practically no movement, and objects\r\nthere situated will merely turn round.\r\n\r\nThe considerations above set forth, with regard to the different speeds\r\nat which different portions of a rotating globe will necessarily be\r\nmoving, is the foundation of an interesting experiment, which gives us\r\nfurther evidence of the rotation of our earth. The measurement around\r\nthe earth at any distance below the surface, say, for instance, at the\r\ndepth of a mile, will clearly be less than a similar measurement at the\r\nsurface itself. The speed of a point at the bottom of a mine, which\r\nresults from the actual rotation of the earth, must therefore be less\r\nthan the speed of a point at the surface overhead. This can be\r\ndefinitely proved by dropping a heavy object down a mine shaft. The\r\nobject, which starts with the greater speed of the surface, will, when\r\nit reaches the bottom of the mine, be found, as might be indeed\r\nexpected, to be a little ahead (_i.e._ to the east) of the point which\r\noriginally lay exactly underneath it. The distance by which the object\r\ngains upon this point is, however, very small. In our latitudes it\r\namounts to about an inch in a fall of 500 feet.\r\n\r\nThe great speed at which, as we have seen, the equatorial regions of\r\nthe earth are moving, should result in giving to the matter there\r\nsituated a certain tendency to fly outwards. Sir Isaac Newton was the\r\nfirst to appreciate this point, and he concluded from it that the earth\r\nmust be _bulged_ a little all round the equator. This is, indeed, found\r\nto be the case, the diameter at the equator being nearly twenty-seven\r\nmiles greater than it is from pole to pole. The reader will, no doubt,\r\nbe here reminded of the familiar comparison in geographies between the\r\nshape of the earth and that of an orange.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to consider that, were the earth to\r\nrotate seventeen times as fast as it does (_i.e._ in one hour\r\ntwenty-five minutes, instead of twenty-four hours), bodies at the\r\nequator would have such a strong tendency to fly outwards that the force\r\nof terrestrial gravity acting upon them would just be counterpoised, and\r\nthey would virtually have _no weight_. And, further, were the earth to\r\nrotate a little faster still, objects lying loose upon its surface would\r\nbe shot off into space.\r\n\r\nThe earth is, therefore, what is technically known as an _oblate\r\nspheroid_; that is, a body of spherical shape flattened at the poles. It\r\nfollows of course from this, that objects at the polar regions are\r\nslightly nearer to the earth's centre than objects at the equatorial\r\nregions. We have already seen that gravitation acts from the central\r\nparts of a body, and that its force is greater the nearer are those\r\ncentral parts. The result of this upon our earth will plainly be that\r\nobjects in the polar regions will be pulled with a slightly stronger\r\npull, and will therefore _weigh_ a trifle more than objects in the\r\nequatorial regions. This is, indeed, found by actual experiment to be\r\nthe case. As an example of the difference in question, Professor Young,\r\nin his _Manual of Astronomy_, points out that a man who weighs 190\r\npounds at the equator would weigh 191 at the pole. In such an experiment\r\nthe weighing would, however, have to be made with a _spring balance_,\r\nand _not with scales_; for, in the latter case, the \"weights\" used would\r\nalter in their weight in exactly the same degree as the objects to be\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\nIt used to be thought that the earth was composed of a relatively thin\r\ncrust, with a molten interior. Scientific men now believe, on the other\r\nhand, that such a condition cannot after all prevail, and that the earth\r\nmust be more or less solid all through, except perhaps in certain\r\nisolated places where collections of molten matter may exist.\r\n\r\nThe _atmosphere_, or air which we breathe, is in the form of a layer of\r\nlimited depth which closely envelops the earth. Actually, it is a\r\nmixture of several gases, the most important being nitrogen and oxygen,\r\nwhich between them practically make up the air, for the proportion of\r\nthe other gases, the chief of which is carbonic acid gas, is exceedingly\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to picture our earth, as we know it, without this atmosphere.\r\nDeprived of it, men at once would die; but even if they could be made to\r\ngo on living without it by any miraculous means, they would be like unto\r\ndeaf beings, for they would never hear any sound. What we call _sounds_\r\nare merely vibrations set up in the air, which travel along and strike\r\nupon the drum of the ear.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is densest near the surface of the earth, and becomes\r\nless and less dense away from it, as a result of diminishing pressure of\r\nair from above. The greater portion of it is accumulated within four or\r\nfive miles of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine exactly at what distance from the earth's\r\nsurface the air ceases altogether, for it grows continually more and\r\nmore rarefied. There are, however, two distinct methods of ascertaining\r\nthe distance beyond which it can be said practically not to exist. One\r\nof these methods we get from twilight. Twilight is, in fact, merely\r\nlight reflected to us from those upper regions of the air, which still\r\ncontinue to be illuminated by the sun after it has disappeared from our\r\nview below the horizon. The time during which twilight lasts, shows us\r\nthat the atmosphere must be at least fifty miles high.\r\n\r\nBut the most satisfactory method of ascertaining the height to which the\r\natmosphere extends is from the observation of meteors. It is found that\r\nthese bodies become ignited, by the friction of passing into the\r\natmosphere, at a height of about 100 miles above the surface of the\r\nearth. We thus gather that the atmosphere has a certain degree of\r\ndensity even at this height. It may, indeed, extend as far as about 150\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe layer of atmosphere surrounding our earth acts somewhat in the\r\nmanner of the glass covering of a greenhouse, bottling in the sun's\r\nrays, and thus storing up their warmth for our benefit. Were this not\r\nso, the heat which we get from the sun would, after falling upon the\r\nearth, be quickly radiated again into space.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to the unsteadiness of the air that stars are seen to\r\ntwinkle. A night when this takes place, though it may please the average\r\nperson, is worse than useless to the astronomer, for the unsteadiness is\r\ngreatly magnified in the telescope. This twinkling is, no doubt, in a\r\ngreat measure responsible for the conventional \"points\" with which Art\r\nhas elected to embellish stars, and which, of course, have no existence\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of _Refraction_,[13] namely, that bending which rays of\r\nlight undergo, when passing _slant-wise_ from a rare into a dense\r\ntransparent medium, are very marked with regard to the atmosphere. The\r\ndenser the medium into which such rays pass, the greater is this bending\r\nfound to be. Since the layer of air around us becomes denser and denser\r\ntowards the surface of the earth, it will readily be granted that the\r\nrays of light reaching our eyes from a celestial object, will suffer the\r\ngreater bending the lower the object happens to be in the sky. Celestial\r\nobjects, unless situated directly overhead, are thus not seen in their\r\ntrue places, and when nearest to the horizon are most out of place. The\r\nbending alluded to is upwards. Thus the sun and the moon, for instance,\r\nwhen we see them resting upon the horizon, are actually _entirely_\r\nbeneath it.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun, too, is sinking towards the horizon, the lower edge of its\r\ndisc will, for the above reason, look somewhat more raised than the\r\nupper. The result is a certain appearance of flattening; which may\r\nplainly be seen by any one who watches the orb at setting.\r\n\r\nIn observations to determine the exact positions of celestial objects\r\ncorrection has to be made for the effects of refraction, according to\r\nthe apparent elevation of these objects in the sky. Such effects are\r\nleast when the objects in question are directly overhead, for then the\r\nrays of light, coming from them to the eye, enter the atmosphere\r\nperpendicularly, and not at any slant.\r\n\r\nA very curious effect, due to refraction, has occasionally been observed\r\nduring a total eclipse of the moon. To produce an eclipse of this kind,\r\n_the earth must, of course, lie directly between the sun and the moon_.\r\nTherefore, when we see the shadow creeping over the moon's surface, the\r\nsun should actually be well below the horizon. But when a lunar eclipse\r\nhappens to come on just about sunset, the sun, although really sunk\r\nbelow the horizon, appears still above it through refraction, and the\r\neclipsed moon, situated, of course, exactly opposite to it in the sky,\r\nis also lifted up above the horizon by the same cause. Pliny, writing in\r\nthe first century of the Christian era, describes an eclipse of this\r\nkind, and refers to it as a \"prodigy.\" The phenomenon is known as a\r\n\"horizontal eclipse.\" It was, no doubt, partly owing to it that the\r\nancients took so long to decide that an eclipse of the moon was really\r\ncaused by the shadow cast by the earth. Plutarch, indeed, remarks that\r\nit was easy enough to understand that a solar eclipse was caused by the\r\ninterposition of the moon, but that one could not imagine by the\r\ninterposition _of what body_ the moon itself could be eclipsed.\r\n\r\nIn that apparent movement of the heavens about the earth, which men now\r\nknow to be caused by the mere rotation of the earth itself, a slight\r\nchange is observed to be continually taking place. The stars, indeed,\r\nare always found to be gradually drawing westward, _i.e._ towards the\r\nsun, and losing themselves one after the other in the blaze of his\r\nlight, only to reappear, however, on the other side of him after a\r\ncertain lapse of time. This is equivalent to saying that the sun itself\r\nseems always creeping slowly _eastward_ in the heaven. The rate at which\r\nthis appears to take place is such that the sun finds itself back again\r\nto its original position, with regard to the starry background, at the\r\nend of a year's time. In other words, the sun seems to make a complete\r\ntour of the heavens in the course of a year. Here, however, we have\r\nanother illusion, just as the daily movement of the sky around the earth\r\nwas an illusion. The truth indeed is, that this apparent movement of the\r\nsun eastward among the stars during a year, arises merely from a\r\n_continuous displacement of his position_ caused by an actual motion of\r\nthe earth itself around him in that very time. In a word, it is the\r\nearth which really moves around the sun, and not the sun around the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe stress laid upon this fundamental point by Copernicus, marks the\r\nseparation of the modern from the ancient view. Not that Copernicus,\r\nindeed, had obtained any real proof that the earth is merely a planet\r\nrevolving around the sun; but it seemed to his profound intellect that a\r\nmovement of this kind on the part of our globe was the more likely\r\nexplanation of the celestial riddle. The idea was not new; for, as we\r\nhave already seen, certain of the ancient Greeks (Aristarchus of Samos,\r\nfor example) had held such a view; but their notions on the subject were\r\nvery fanciful, and unsupported by any good argument.\r\n\r\nWhat Copernicus, however, really seems to have done was to _insist_ upon\r\nthe idea that the sun occupied the _centre_, as being more consonant\r\nwith common sense. No doubt, he was led to take up this position by the\r\nfact that the sun appeared entirely of a different character from the\r\nother members of the system. The one body in the scheme, which performed\r\nthe important function of dispenser of light and heat, would indeed be\r\nmore likely to occupy a position apart from the rest; and what position\r\nmore appropriate for its purposes than the centre!\r\n\r\nBut here Copernicus only partially solved the difficult question. He\r\nunfortunately still clung to an ancient belief, which as yet remained\r\nunquestioned; _i.e._ the great virtue, one might almost say, the\r\n_divineness_, of circular motion. The ancients had been hag-ridden, so\r\nto speak, by the circle; and it appeared to them that such a perfectly\r\nformed curve was alone fitted for the celestial motions. Ptolemy\r\nemployed it throughout his system. According to him the \"planets\" (which\r\nincluded, under the ancient view, both the sun and the moon), moved\r\naround the earth in circles; but, as their changing positions in the sky\r\ncould not be altogether accounted for in this way, it was further\r\nsupposed that they performed additional circular movements, around\r\npeculiarly placed centres, during the course of their orbital\r\nrevolutions. Thus the Ptolemaic system grew to be extremely\r\ncomplicated; for astronomers did not hesitate to add new circular\r\nmovements whenever the celestial positions calculated for the planets\r\nwere found not to tally with the positions observed. In this manner,\r\nindeed, they succeeded in doctoring the theory, so that it fairly\r\nsatisfied the observations made with the rough instruments of\r\npre-telescopic times.\r\n\r\nAlthough Copernicus performed the immense service to astronomy of boldly\r\ndirecting general attention to the central position of the sun, he\r\nunfortunately took over for the new scheme the circular machinery of the\r\nPtolemaic system. It therefore remained for the famous Kepler, who lived\r\nabout a century after him, to find the complete solution. Just as\r\nCopernicus, for instance, had broken free from tradition with regard to\r\nthe place of the sun; so did Kepler, in turn, break free from the spell\r\nof circular motion, and thus set the coping-stone to the new\r\nastronomical edifice. This astronomer showed, in fact, that if the paths\r\nof the planets around the sun, and of the moon around the earth, were\r\nnot circles, but _ellipses_, the movements of these bodies about the sky\r\ncould be correctly accounted for. The extreme simplicity of such an\r\narrangement was far more acceptable than the bewildering intricacy of\r\nmovement required by the Ptolemaic theory. The Copernican system, as\r\namended by Kepler, therefore carried the day; and was further\r\nstrengthened, as we have already seen, by the telescopic observations of\r\nGalileo and the researches of Newton into the effects of gravitation.\r\n\r\nAnd here a word on the circle, now fallen from its high estate. The\r\nancients were in error in supposing that it stood entirely apart--the\r\ncurve of curves. As a matter of fact it is merely _a special kind of\r\nellipse_. To put it paradoxically, it is an ellipse which has no\r\nellipticity, an oval without any ovalness!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, astronomy had to wait yet a long time for a\r\ndefinite proof of the revolution of the earth around the sun. The\r\nleading argument advanced by Aristotle, against the reality of any\r\nmovement of the earth, still held good up to about seventy years ago.\r\nThat philosopher had pointed out that the earth could not move about in\r\nspace to any great extent, or the stars would be found to alter their\r\napparent places in the sky, a thing which had never been observed to\r\nhappen. Centuries ran on, and instruments became more and more perfect,\r\nyet no displacements of stars were noted. In accepting the Copernican\r\ntheory men were therefore obliged to suppose these objects as\r\nimmeasurably distant. At length, however, between the years 1835 and\r\n1840, it was discovered by the Prussian astronomer, Bessel, that a star\r\nknown as 61 Cygni--that is to say, the star marked in celestial atlases\r\nas No. 61 in the constellation of the Swan--appeared, during the course\r\nof a year, to perform a tiny circle in the heavens, such as would result\r\nfrom a movement on our own part around the sun. Since then about\r\nforty-three stars have been found to show minute displacements of a\r\nsimilar kind, which cannot be accounted for upon any other supposition\r\nthan that of a continuous revolution of the earth around the sun. The\r\ntriumph of the Copernican system is now at last supreme.\r\n\r\nIf the axis of the earth stood \"straight up,\" so to speak, while the\r\nearth revolved in its orbit, the sun would plainly keep always on a\r\nlevel with the equator. This is equivalent to stating that, in such\r\ncircumstances, a person at the equator would see it rise each morning\r\nexactly in the east, pass through the _zenith_, that is, the point\r\ndirectly overhead of him, at midday, and set in the evening due in the\r\nwest. As this would go on unchangingly at the equator every day\r\nthroughout the year, it should be clear that, at any particular place\r\nupon the earth, the sun would in these conditions always be seen to move\r\nin an unvarying manner across the sky at a certain altitude depending\r\nupon the latitude of the place. Thus the more north one went upon the\r\nearth's surface, the more southerly in the sky would the sun's path lie;\r\nwhile at the north pole itself, the sun would always run round and round\r\nthe horizon. Similarly, the more south one went from the equator the\r\nmore northerly would the path of the sun lie, while at the south pole it\r\nwould be seen to skirt the horizon in the same manner as at the north\r\npole. The result of such an arrangement would be, that each place upon\r\nthe earth would always have one unvarying climate; in which case there\r\nwould not exist any of those beneficial changes of season to which we\r\nowe so much.\r\n\r\nThe changes of season, which we fortunately experience, are due,\r\nhowever, to the fact that the sun does not appear to move across the sky\r\neach day at one unvarying altitude, but is continually altering the\r\nposition of its path; so that at one period of the year it passes across\r\nthe sky low down, and remains above the horizon for a short time only,\r\nwhile at another it moves high up across the heavens, and is above the\r\nhorizon for a much longer time. Actually, the sun seems little by little\r\nto creep up the sky during one half of the year, namely, from mid-winter\r\nto mid-summer, and then, just as gradually, to slip down it again during\r\nthe other half, namely, from mid-summer to mid-winter. It will therefore\r\nbe clear that every region of the earth is much more thoroughly warmed\r\nduring one portion of the year than during another, _i.e._ when the\r\nsun's path is high in the heavens than when it is low down.\r\n\r\nOnce more we find appearances exactly the contrary from the truth. The\r\nearth is in this case the real cause of the deception, just as it was in\r\nthe other cases. The sun does not actually creep slowly up the sky, and\r\nthen slowly dip down it again, but, owing to the earth's axis being set\r\naslant, different regions of the earth's surface are presented to the\r\nsun at different times. Thus, in one portion of its orbit, the northerly\r\nregions of the earth are presented to the sun, and in the other portion\r\nthe southerly. It follows of course from this, that when it is summer in\r\nthe northern hemisphere it is winter in the southern, and _vice versâ_\r\n(see Fig. 13, p. 176).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Summer and Winter.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that, in consequence of this slant of the earth's axis, the sun\r\nis for part of the year on the north side of the equator and part of the\r\nyear on the south side, leads to a very peculiar result. The path of the\r\nmoon around the earth is nearly on the same plane with the earth's path\r\naround the sun. The moon, therefore, always keeps to the same regions of\r\nthe sky as the sun. The slant of the earth's axis thus regularly\r\ndisplaces the position of both the sun and the moon to the north and\r\nsouth sides of the equator respectively in the manner we have been\r\ndescribing. Were the earth, however, a perfect sphere, such change of\r\nposition would not produce any effect. We have shown, however, that the\r\nearth is not a perfect sphere, but that it is bulged out all round the\r\nequator. The result is that this bulged-out portion swings slowly under\r\nthe pulls of solar and lunar gravitation, in response to the\r\ndisplacements of the sun and moon to the north and to the south of it.\r\nThis slow swing of the equatorial regions results, of course, in a\r\ncertain slow change of the direction of the earth's axis, so that the\r\nnorth pole does not go on pointing continually to the same region of the\r\nsky. The change in the direction of the axis is, however, so extremely\r\nslight, that it shows up only after the lapse of ages. The north pole of\r\nthe heavens, that is, the region of the sky towards which the north pole\r\nof the earth's axis points, displaces therefore extremely slowly,\r\ntracing out a wide circle, and arriving back again to the same position\r\nin the sky only after a period of about 25,000 years. At present the\r\nnorth pole of the heavens is quite close to a bright star in the tail of\r\nthe constellation of the Little Bear, which is consequently known as the\r\nPole Star; but in early Greek times it was at least ten times as far\r\naway from this star as it is now. After some 12,000 years the pole will\r\npoint to the constellation of Lyra, and Vega, the most brilliant star in\r\nthat constellation, will then be considered as the pole star. This slow\r\ntwisting of the earth's axis is technically known as _Precession_, or\r\nthe _Precession of the Equinoxes_ (see Plate XIX., p. 292).\r\n\r\nThe slow displacement of the celestial pole appears to have attracted\r\nthe attention of men in very early times, but it was not until the\r\nsecond century B.C. that precession was established as a fact by the\r\ncelebrated Greek astronomer, Hipparchus. For the ancients this strange\r\ncyclical movement had a mystic significance; and they looked towards the\r\nend of the period as the end, so to speak, of a \"dispensation,\" after\r\nwhich the life of the universe would begin anew:--\r\n\r\n\"Magnus ab integro sæclorum nascitur ordo.\r\nJam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;\r\n   .      .      .      .      .      .\r\nAlter erit tum Tiphys, et altera quæ vehat Argo\r\nDelectos heroas; erunt etiam altera bella,\r\nAtque iterum ad Trojam magnus mittetur Achilles.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the orbit of the earth is an ellipse, and that the sun\r\nis situated at what is called the _focus_, a point not in the middle of\r\nthe ellipse, but rather towards one of its ends. Therefore, during the\r\ncourse of the year the distance of the earth from the sun varies. The\r\nsun, in consequence of this, is about 3,000,000 miles _nearer_ to us in\r\nour northern _winter_ than it is in our northern summer, a statement\r\nwhich sounds somewhat paradoxical. This variation in distance, large as\r\nit appears in figures, can, however, not be productive of much\r\nalteration in the amount of solar heat which we receive, for during the\r\nfirst week in January, when the distance is least, the sun only looks\r\nabout _one-eighteenth_ broader than at the commencement of July, when\r\nthe distance is greatest. The great disparity in temperature between\r\nwinter and summer depends, as we have seen, upon causes of quite another\r\nkind, and varies between such wide limits that the effects of this\r\nslight alteration in the distance of the sun from the earth may be\r\nneglected for practical purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon upon\r\nthe water of the earth's surface. Of the two, the moon, being so much\r\nthe nearer, exerts the stronger pull, and therefore may be regarded as\r\nthe chief cause of the tides. This pull always draws that portion of the\r\nwater, which happens to be right underneath the moon at the time, into a\r\nheap; and there is also a _second_ heaping of water at the same moment\r\n_at the contrary side of the earth_, the reasons for which can be shown\r\nmathematically, but cannot be conveniently dealt with here.\r\n\r\nAs the earth rotates on its axis each portion of its surface passes\r\nbeneath the moon, and is swelled up by this pull; the watery portions\r\nbeing, however, the only ones to yield visibly. A similar swelling up,\r\nas we have seen, takes place at the point exactly away from the moon.\r\nThus each portion of our globe is borne by the rotation through two\r\n\"tide-areas\" every day, and this is the reason why there are two tides\r\nduring every twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the watery swelling is known as high tide. The journey of\r\nthe moon around the earth takes about a month, and this brings her past\r\neach place in turn by about fifty minutes later each day, which is the\r\nreason why high tide is usually about twenty-five minutes later each\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe moon is, however, not the sole cause of the tides, but the sun, as\r\nwe have said, has a part in the matter also. When it is new moon the\r\ngravitational attractions of both sun and moon are clearly acting\r\ntogether from precisely the same direction, and, therefore, the tide\r\nwill be pulled up higher than at other times. At full moon, too, the\r\nsame thing happens; for, although the bodies are now acting from\r\nopposite directions, they do not neutralise each other's pulls as one\r\nmight imagine, since the sun, in the same manner as the moon, produces a\r\ntide both under it and also at the opposite side of the earth. Thus both\r\nthese tides are actually increased in height. The exceptionally high\r\ntides which we experience at new and full moons are known as _Spring\r\nTides_, in contradistinction to the minimum high tides, which are known\r\nas _Neap Tides_.\r\n\r\nThe ancients appear to have had some idea of the cause of the tides. It\r\nis said that as early as 1000 B.C. the Chinese noticed that the moon\r\nexerted an influence upon the waters of the sea. The Greeks and Romans,\r\ntoo, had noticed the same thing; and Cæsar tells us that when he was\r\nembarking his troops for Britain the tide was high _because_ the moon\r\nwas full. Pliny went even further than this, in recognising a similar\r\nconnection between the waters and the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom casual observation one is inclined to suppose that the high tide\r\nalways rises many feet. But that this is not the case is evidenced by\r\nthe fact that the tides in the midst of the great oceans are only from\r\nthree to four feet high. However, in the seas and straits around our\r\nIsles, for instance, the tides rise very many feet indeed, but this is\r\nmerely owing to the extra heaping up which the large volumes of water\r\nundergo in forcing their passage through narrow channels.\r\n\r\nAs the earth, in rotating, is continually passing through these\r\ntide-areas, one might expect that the friction thus set up would tend to\r\nslow down the rotation itself. Such a slowing down, or \"tidal drag,\" as\r\nit is called, is indeed continually going on; but the effects produced\r\nare so exceedingly minute that it will take many millions of years to\r\nmake the rotation appreciably slower, and so to lengthen the day.\r\n\r\nRecently it has been proved that the axis of the earth is subject to a\r\nvery small displacement, or rather, \"wobbling,\" in the course of a\r\nperiod of somewhat over a year. As a consequence of this, the pole\r\nshifts its place through a circle of, roughly, a few yards in width\r\nduring the time in question. This movement is, perhaps, the combined\r\nresult of two causes. One of these is the change of place during the\r\nyear of large masses of material upon our earth; such as occurs, for\r\ninstance, when ice and snow melt, or when atmospheric and ocean\r\ncurrents transport from place to place great bodies of air and water.\r\nThe other cause is supposed to be the fact that the earth is not\r\nabsolutely rigid, and so yields to certain strains upon it. In the\r\ncourse of investigation of this latter point the interesting conclusion\r\nhas been reached by the famous American astronomer, Professor Simon\r\nNewcomb, that our globe as a whole is _a little more rigid than steel_.\r\n\r\nWe will bring this chapter to a close by alluding briefly to two strange\r\nappearances which are sometimes seen in our night skies. These are known\r\nrespectively as the Zodiacal Light and the Gegenschein.\r\n\r\nThe _Zodiacal Light_ is a faint cone-shaped illumination which is seen\r\nto extend upwards from the western horizon after evening twilight has\r\nended, and from the eastern horizon before morning twilight has begun.\r\nIt appears to rise into the sky from about the position where the sun\r\nwould be at that time. The proper season of the year for observing it\r\nduring the evening is in the spring, while in autumn it is best seen in\r\nthe early morning. In our latitudes its light is not strong enough to\r\nrender it visible when the moon is full, but in the tropics it is\r\nreported to be very bright, and easily seen in full moonlight. One\r\ntheory regards it as the reflection of light from swarms of meteors\r\nrevolving round the sun; another supposes it to be a very rarefied\r\nextension of the corona.\r\n\r\nThe _Gegenschein_ (German for \"counter-glow\") is a faint oval patch of\r\nlight, seen in the sky exactly opposite to the place of the sun. It is\r\nusually treated of in connection with the zodiacal light, and one theory\r\nregards it similarly as of meteoric origin. Another theory,\r\nhowever--that of Mr. Evershed--considers it a sort of _tail_ to the\r\nearth (like a comet's tail) composed of hydrogen and helium--the two\r\n_lightest_ gases we know--driven off from our planet in the direction\r\ncontrary to the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] Every one knows the simple experiment in which a coin lying at the\r\nbottom of an empty basin, and hidden from the eye by its side, becomes\r\nvisible when a certain quantity of water has been poured in. This is an\r\nexample of refraction. The rays of light coming from the coin ought\r\n_not_ to reach the eye, on account of the basin's side being in the way;\r\nyet by the action of the water they are _refracted_, or bent over its\r\nedge, in such a manner that they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we call the moon's \"phases\" are merely the various ways in which we\r\nsee the sun shining upon her surface during the course of her monthly\r\nrevolutions around the earth (see Fig. 14, p. 184). When she passes in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the sun all his light falls upon that side which is\r\nturned away from us, and so the side which is turned towards us is\r\nunillumined, and therefore invisible. When in this position the moon is\r\nspoken of as _new_.\r\n\r\nAs she continues her motion around the earth, she draws gradually to the\r\neast of the sun's place in the sky. The sunlight then comes somewhat\r\nfrom the side; and so we see a small portion of the right side of the\r\nlunar disc illuminated. This is the phase known as the _crescent_ moon.\r\n\r\nAs she moves on in her orbit more and more of her illuminated surface is\r\nbrought into view; and so the crescent of light becomes broader and\r\nbroader, until we get what is called half-moon, or _first quarter_, when\r\nwe see exactly one-half of her surface lit up by the sun's rays. As she\r\ndraws still further round yet more of her illuminated surface is brought\r\ninto view, until three-quarters of the disc appear lighted up. She is\r\nthen said to be _gibbous_.\r\n\r\nEventually she moves round so that she faces the sun completely, and\r\nthe whole of her disc appears illuminated. She is then spoken of as\r\n_full_. When in this position it is clear that she is on the contrary\r\nside of the earth to the sun, and therefore rises about the same time\r\nthat he is setting. She is now, in fact, at her furthest from the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Direction from which the sun's rays are coming.\r\n\r\nVarious positions and illumination of the mooon by the sun during her\r\nrevolution around the earth.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding positions as viewed from the earth, showing the\r\nconsequent phases.\r\n\r\nFIG. 14.--Orbit and Phases of the Moon.]\r\n\r\nAfter this, the motion of the moon in her orbit carries her on back\r\nagain in the direction of the sun. She thus goes through her phases as\r\nbefore, only these of course are _in the reverse order_. The full phase\r\nis seen to give place to the gibbous, and this in turn to the half-moon\r\nand to the crescent; after which her motion carries her into the\r\nneighbourhood of the sun, and she is once more new, and lost to our\r\nsight in the solar glare. Following this she draws away to the east of\r\nthe sun again, and the old order of phases repeat themselves as before.\r\n\r\nThe early Babylonians imagined that the moon had a bright and a dark\r\nside, and that her phases were caused by the bright side coming more and\r\nmore into view during her movement around the sky. The Greeks, notably\r\nAristotle, set to work to examine the question from a mathematical\r\nstandpoint, and came to the conclusion that the crescent and other\r\nappearances were such as would necessarily result if the moon were a\r\ndark body of spherical shape illumined merely by the light of the sun.\r\n\r\nAlthough the true explanation of the moon's phases has thus been known\r\nfor centuries, it is unfortunately not unusual to see\r\npictures--advertisement posters, for instance--in which stars appear\r\n_within_ the horns of a crescent moon! Can it be that there are to-day\r\neducated persons who believe that the moon is a thing which _grows_ to a\r\ncertain size and then wastes away again; who, in fact, do not know that\r\nthe entire body of the moon is there all the while?\r\n\r\nWhen the moon shows a very thin crescent, we are able dimly to see her\r\nstill dark portion standing out against the sky. This appearance is\r\npopularly known as the \"old moon in the new moon's arms.\" The dark part\r\nof her surface must, indeed, be to some degree illumined, or we should\r\nnot be able to see it at all. Whence then comes the light which\r\nillumines it, since it clearly cannot come from the sun? The riddle is\r\neasily solved, if we consider what kind of view of our earth an observer\r\nsituated on this darkened part of the moon would at that moment get. He\r\nwould, as a matter of fact, just then see nearly the whole disc of the\r\nearth brightly lit up by sunlight. The lunar landscape all around would,\r\ntherefore, be bathed in what to _him_ would be \"earthlight,\" which of\r\ncourse takes the place there of what _we_ call moonlight. If, then, we\r\nrecollect how much greater in size the earth is than the moon, it should\r\nnot surprise us that this earthlight will be many times brighter than\r\nmoonlight. It is considered, indeed, to be some twenty times brighter.\r\nIt is thus not at all astonishing that we can see the dark portion of\r\nthe moon illumined merely by sunlight reflected upon it from our earth.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were greatly exercised in their minds to account for this\r\n\"earthlight,\" or \"earthshine,\" as it is also called. Posidonius (135-51\r\nB.C.) tried to explain it by supposing that the moon was partially\r\ntransparent, and that some sunlight consequently filtered through from\r\nthe other side. It was not, however, until the fifteenth century that\r\nthe correct solution was arrived at.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One side of the moon only is ever presented to the\r\nearth. This side is here indicated by the letters S.F.E. (side facing\r\nearth).\r\n\r\nBy placing the above positions in a row, we can see at once that the\r\nmoon makes one complete rotation on her axis in exactly the same time as\r\nshe revolves around the earth.\r\n\r\nFIG. 15.--The Rotation of the Moon on her Axis.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing which one notices about the moon is\r\nthat she always turns the same side towards us, and so we never see her\r\nother side. One might be led from this to jump to the conclusion that\r\nshe does not rotate upon an axis, as do the other bodies which we see;\r\nbut, paradoxical as it may appear, the fact that she turns one face\r\nalways towards the earth, is actually a proof that she _does_ rotate\r\nupon an axis. The rotation, however, takes place with such slowness,\r\nthat she turns round but once during the time in which she revolves\r\naround the earth (see Fig. 15). In order to understand the matter\r\nclearly, let the reader place an object in the centre of a room and walk\r\naround it once, _keeping his face turned towards it the whole time_,\r\nWhile he is doing this, it is evident that he will face every one of the\r\nfour walls of the room in succession. Now in order to face each of the\r\nfour walls of a room in succession one would be obliged _to turn oneself\r\nentirely round_. Therefore, during the act of walking round an object\r\nwith his face turned directly towards it, a person at the same time\r\nturns his body once entirely round.\r\n\r\nIn the long, long past the moon must have turned round much faster than\r\nthis. Her rate of rotation has no doubt been slowed down by the action\r\nof some force. It will be recollected how, in the course of the previous\r\nchapter, we found that the tides were tending, though exceedingly\r\ngradually, to slow down the rotation of the earth upon its axis. But, on\r\naccount of the earth's much greater mass, the force of gravitation\r\nexercised by it upon the surface of the moon is, of course, much more\r\npowerful than that which the moon exercises upon the surface of the\r\nearth. The tendency to tidal action on the moon itself must, therefore,\r\nbe much in excess of anything which we here experience. It is, in\r\nconsequence, probable that such a tidal drag, extending over a very long\r\nperiod of time, has resulted in slowing down the moon's rotation to its\r\npresent rate.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we never see but one side of the moon has given rise from\r\ntime to time to fantastic speculations with regard to the other side.\r\nSome, indeed, have wished to imagine that our satellite is shaped like\r\nan egg, the more pointed end being directed away from us. We are here,\r\nof course, faced with a riddle, which is all the more tantalising from\r\nits appearing for ever insoluble to men, chained as they are to the\r\nearth. However, it seems going too far to suppose that any abnormal\r\nconditions necessarily exist at the other side of the moon. As a matter\r\nof fact, indeed, small portions of that side are brought into our view\r\nfrom time to time in consequence of slight irregularities in the moon's\r\nmovement; and these portions differ in no way from those which we\r\nordinarily see. On the whole, we obtain a view of about 60 per cent. of\r\nthe entire lunar surface; that is to say, a good deal more than\r\none-half.\r\n\r\nThe actual diameter of the moon is about 2163 miles, which is somewhat\r\nmore than one-quarter the diameter of the earth. For a satellite,\r\ntherefore, she seems very large compared with her primary, the earth;\r\nwhen we consider that Jupiter's greatest satellite, although nearly\r\ntwice as broad as our moon, has a diameter only one twenty-fifth that of\r\nJupiter. Furthermore, the moon moves around the earth comparatively\r\nslowly, making only about thirteen revolutions during the entire year.\r\nSeen from space, therefore, she would not give the impression of a\r\ncircling body, as other satellites do. Her revolutions are, indeed,\r\nrelatively so very slow that she would appear rather like a smaller\r\nplanet accompanying the earth in its orbit. In view of all this, some\r\nastronomers are inclined to regard the earth and moon rather as a\r\n\"double planet\" than as a system of planet and satellite.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon is full she attracts more attention perhaps than in any of\r\nher other phases. The moon, in order to be full, must needs be in that\r\nregion of the heavens exactly opposite to the sun. The sun _appears_ to\r\ngo once entirely round the sky in the course of a year, and the moon\r\nperforms the same journey in the space of about a month. The moon, when\r\nfull, having got half-way round this journey, occupies, therefore, that\r\nregion of the sky which the sun itself will occupy half a year later.\r\nThus in winter the full moon will be found roughly to occupy the sun's\r\nsummer position in the sky, and in summer the sun's winter position. It\r\ntherefore follows that the full moon in winter time is high up in the\r\nheavens, while in summer time it is low down. We thus get the greatest\r\namount of full moonlight when it is the most needed.\r\n\r\nThe great French astronomer, Laplace, being struck by the fact that the\r\n\"lesser light\" did not rule the night to anything like the same extent\r\nthat the \"greater light\" ruled the day, set to work to examine the\r\nconditions under which it might have been made to do so. The result of\r\nhis speculations showed that if the moon were removed to such a distance\r\nthat she took a year instead of a month to revolve around the earth; and\r\nif she were started off in her orbit at full moon, she would always\r\ncontinue to remain full--a great advantage for us. Whewell, however,\r\npointed out that in order to get the moon to move with the requisite\r\ndegree of slowness, she would have to revolve so far from the earth that\r\nshe would only look one-sixteenth as large as she does at present, which\r\nrather militates against the advantage Laplace had in mind! Finally,\r\nhowever, it was shown by M. Liouville, in 1845, that the position of a\r\n_perennial full moon_, such as Laplace dreamed of, would be\r\nunstable--that is to say, the body in question could not for long remain\r\nundisturbed in the situation suggested (see Fig. 16, p. 191).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Various positions of Laplace's \"Moon\" with regard to the\r\nearth and sun during the course of a year.\r\n\r\nThe same positions of Laplace's \"Moon,\" arranged around the earth, show\r\nthat it would make only one revolution in a year.\r\n\r\nFIG. 16.--Laplace's \"Perennial Full Moon.\"]\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known phenomenon called _harvest moon_, concerning the\r\nnature of which there seems to be much popular confusion. An idea in\r\nfact appears to prevail among a good many people that the moon is a\r\nharvest moon when, at rising, it looks bigger and redder than usual.\r\nSuch an appearance has, however, nothing at all to say to the matter;\r\nfor the moon always _looks_ larger when low down in the sky, and,\r\nfurthermore, it usually looks red in the later months of the year, when\r\nthere is more mist and fog about than there is in summer. What\r\nastronomers actually term the harvest moon is, indeed, something\r\nentirely different from this. About the month of September the slant at\r\nwhich the full moon comes up from below the horizon happens to be such\r\nthat, during several evenings together, she _rises almost at the same\r\nhour_, instead of some fifty minutes later, as is usually the case. As\r\nthe harvest is being gathered in about that time, it has come to be\r\npopularly considered that this is a provision of nature, according to\r\nwhich the sunlight is, during several evenings, replaced without delay\r\nby more or less full-moonlight, in order that harvesters may continue\r\ntheir work straight on into the night, and not be obliged to break off\r\nafter sunset to wait until the moon rises. The same phenomenon is almost\r\nexactly repeated a month later, but by reason of the pursuits then\r\ncarried on it is known as the \"hunter's moon.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection should be mentioned that curious phenomenon above\r\nalluded to, and which seems to attract universal notice, namely, that\r\nthe moon _looks much larger when near the horizon_--at its rising, for\r\ninstance, than when higher up in the sky. This seeming enlargement is,\r\nhowever, by no means confined to the moon. That the sun also looks much\r\nlarger when low down in the sky than when high up, seems to strike even\r\nthe most casual watcher of a sunset. The same kind of effect will,\r\nindeed, be noted if close attention be paid to the stars themselves. A\r\nconstellation, for instance, appears more spread out when low down in\r\nthe sky than when high up. This enlargement of celestial objects when in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the horizon is, however, only _apparent_ and not\r\nreal. It must be entirely an _illusion_; for the most careful\r\nmeasurements of the discs of the sun and of the moon fail to show that\r\nthe bodies are any larger when near the horizon than when high up in the\r\nsky. In fact, if there be any difference in measurements with regard to\r\nthe moon, it will be found to be the other way round; for her disc, when\r\ncarefully measured, is actually the slightest degree _greater_ when\r\n_high_ in the sky, than when low down. The reason for this is that, on\r\naccount of the rotundity of the earth's surface, she is a trifle nearer\r\nthe observer when overhead of him.\r\n\r\nThis apparent enlargement of celestial objects, when low down in the\r\nsky, is granted on all sides to be an illusion; but although the\r\nquestion has been discussed with animation time out of mind, none of the\r\nexplanations proposed can be said to have received unreserved\r\nacceptance. The one which usually figures in text-books is that we\r\nunconsciously compare the sun and moon, when low down in the sky, with\r\nthe terrestrial objects in the same field of view, and are therefore\r\ninclined to exaggerate the size of these orbs. Some persons, on the\r\nother hand, imagine the illusion to have its source in the structure of\r\nthe human eye; while others, again, put it down to the atmosphere,\r\nmaintaining that the celestial objects in question _loom_ large in the\r\nthickened air near the horizon, in the same way that they do when viewed\r\nthrough fog or mist.\r\n\r\nThe writer[14] ventures, however, to think that the illusion has its\r\norigin in our notion of the shape of the celestial vault. One would be\r\ninclined, indeed, to suppose that this vault ought to appear to us as\r\nthe half of a hollow sphere; but he maintains that it does not so\r\nappear, as a consequence of the manner in which the eyes of men are set\r\nquite close together in their heads. If one looks, for instance, high up\r\nin the sky, the horizon cannot come within the field of view, and so\r\nthere is nothing to make one think that the expanse then gazed upon is\r\nother than quite _flat_--let us say like the ceiling of a room. But, as\r\nthe eyes are lowered, a portion of the _encircling_ horizon comes\r\ngradually into the field of view, and the region of the sky then gazed\r\nupon tends in consequence to assume a _hollowed-out_ form. From this it\r\nwould seem that our idea of the shape of the celestial vault is, that it\r\nis _flattened down over our heads and hollowed out all around in the\r\nneighbourhood of the horizon_ (see Fig. 17, p. 195). Now, as a\r\nconsequence of their very great distance, all the objects in the heavens\r\nnecessarily appear to us to move as if they were placed on the\r\nbackground of the vault; the result being that the mind is obliged to\r\nconceive them as expanded or contracted, in its unconscious attempts to\r\nmake them always fill their due proportion of space in the various parts\r\nof this abnormally shaped sky.\r\n\r\nFrom such considerations the writer concludes that the apparent\r\nenlargement in question is merely the natural consequence of the idea we\r\nhave of the shape of the celestial vault--an idea gradually built up in\r\nchildhood, to become later on what is called \"second nature.\" And in\r\nsupport of this contention, he would point to the fact that the\r\nenlargement is not by any means confined to the sun and moon, but is\r\nevery whit as marked in the case of the constellations. To one who has\r\nnot noticed this before, it is really quite a revelation to compare the\r\nappearance of one of the large constellations (Orion, for instance) when\r\nhigh up in the sky and when low down. The widening apart of the various\r\nstars composing the group, when in the latter position, is very\r\nnoticeable indeed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Illustrating the author's explanation of the\r\napparent enlargement of celestial objects.]\r\n\r\nFurther, if a person were to stand in the centre of a large dome, he\r\nwould be exactly situated as if he were beneath the vaulted heaven, and\r\none would consequently expect him to suffer the same illusion as to the\r\nshape of the dome. Objects fixed upon its background would therefore\r\nappear to him under the same conditions as objects in the sky, and the\r\nillusions as to their apparent enlargement should hold good here also.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a Belgian astronomer, M. Stroobant, in an investigation\r\nof the matter at issue, chanced to make a series of experiments under\r\nthe very conditions just detailed. To various portions of the inner\r\nsurface of a large dome he attached pairs of electric lights; and on\r\nplacing himself at the centre of the building, he noticed that, in every\r\ncase, those pairs which were high up appeared closer together than those\r\nwhich were low down! He does not, however, seem to have sought for the\r\ncause in the vaulted expanse. On the contrary, he attributed the effect\r\nto something connected with our upright stature, to some physiological\r\nreason which regularly makes us estimate objects as larger when in front\r\nthan when overhead.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this matter, it may be noted that it always appears\r\nextremely difficult to estimate with the eye the exact height above the\r\nhorizon at which any object (say a star) happens to be. Even skilled\r\nobservers find themselves in error in attempting to do so. This seems to\r\nbear out the writer's contention that the form under which the celestial\r\nvault really appears to us is a peculiar one, and tends to give rise to\r\nfalse judgments.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this question, it should also be mentioned that nothing\r\nperhaps is more deceptive than the size which objects in the sky appear\r\nto present. The full moon looks so like a huge plate, that it astonishes\r\none to find that a threepenny bit held at arm's length will a long way\r\nmore than cover its disc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII. THE MOON\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken at the Paris Observatory by M.P. Puiseux.\r\n\r\n(Page 197)]\r\n\r\nThe moon is just too far off to allow us to see the actual detail on\r\nher surface with the naked eye. When thus viewed she merely displays a\r\npatchy appearance,[15] and the imaginary forms which her darker markings\r\nsuggest to the fancy are popularly expressed by the term \"Man in the\r\nMoon.\" An examination of her surface with very moderate optical aid is,\r\nhowever, quite a revelation, and the view we then get is not easily\r\ncomparable to what we see with the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nEven with an ordinary opera-glass, an observer will be able to note a\r\ngood deal of detail upon the lunar disc. If it be his first observation\r\nof the kind, he cannot fail to be struck by the fact to which we have\r\njust made allusion, namely, the great change which the moon appears to\r\nundergo when viewed with magnifying power. \"Cain and his Dog,\" the \"Man\r\nin the Moon gathering sticks,\" or whatever indeed his fancy was wont to\r\nconjure up from the lights and shades upon the shining surface, have now\r\ncompletely disappeared; and he sees instead a silvery globe marked here\r\nand there with extensive dark areas, and pitted all over with\r\ncrater-like formations (see Plate VIII., p. 196). The dark areas retain\r\neven to the present day their ancient name of \"seas,\" for Galileo and\r\nthe early telescopic observers believed them to be such, and they are\r\nstill catalogued under the mystic appellations given to them in the long\r\nago; as, for instance, \"Sea of Showers,\" \"Bay of Rainbows,\" \"Lake of\r\nDreams.\"[16] The improved telescopes of later times showed, however,\r\nthat they were not really seas (there is no water on the moon), but\r\nmerely areas of darker material.\r\n\r\nThe crater-like formations above alluded to are the \"lunar mountains.\" A\r\nperson examining the moon for the first time with telescopic aid, will\r\nperhaps not at once grasp the fact that his view of lunar mountains must\r\nneeds be what is called a \"bird's-eye\" one, namely, a view from above,\r\nlike that from a balloon and that he cannot, of course, expect to see\r\nthem from the side, as he does the mountains upon the earth. But once he\r\nhas realised this novel point of view, he will no doubt marvel at the\r\nformations which lie scattered as it were at his feet. The type of lunar\r\nmountain is indeed in striking contrast to the terrestrial type. On our\r\nearth the range-formation is supreme; on the moon the crater-formation\r\nis the rule, and is so-called from analogy to our volcanoes. A typical\r\nlunar crater may be described as a circular wall, enclosing a central\r\nplain, or \"floor,\" which is often much depressed below the level of the\r\nsurface outside. These so-called \"craters,\" or \"ring-mountains,\" as they\r\nare also termed, are often of gigantic proportions. For instance, the\r\ncentral plain of one of them, known as Ptolemæus,[17] is about 115 miles\r\nacross, while that of Plato is about 60. The walls of craters often rise\r\nto great heights; which, in proportion to the small size of the moon,\r\nare very much in excess of our highest terrestrial elevations.\r\nNevertheless, a person posted at the centre of one of the larger craters\r\nmight be surprised to find that he could not see the encompassing\r\ncrater-walls, which would in every direction be below his horizon. This\r\nwould arise not alone from the great breadth of the crater itself, but\r\nalso from the fact that the curving of the moon's surface is very sharp\r\ncompared with that of our earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX. MAP OF THE MOON, SHOWING THE PRINCIPAL\r\n\"CRATERS,\" MOUNTAIN RANGES, AND \"SEAS\"\r\n\r\nIn this, as in the other plates of the Moon, the _South_ will be found\r\nat the top of the picture; such being the view given by the ordinary\r\nastronomical telescope, in which all objects are seen _inverted_.\r\n\r\n(Page 199)]\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned Ptolemæus as among the very large craters, or\r\nring-mountains, on the moon. Its encompassing walls rise to nearly\r\n13,000 feet, and it has the further distinction of being almost in the\r\ncentre of the lunar disc. There are, however, several others much wider,\r\nbut they are by no means in such a conspicuous position. For instance,\r\nSchickard, close to the south-eastern border, is nearly 130 miles in\r\ndiameter, and its wall rises in one point to over 10,000 feet. Grimaldi,\r\nalmost exactly at the east point, is nearly as large as Schickard.\r\nAnother crater, Clavius, situated near the south point, is about 140\r\nmiles across; while its neighbour Bailly--named after a famous French\r\nastronomer of the eighteenth century--is 180, and the largest of those\r\nwhich we can see (see Plate IX., p. 198).\r\n\r\nMany of the lunar craters encroach upon one another; in fact there is\r\nnot really room for them all upon the visible hemisphere of the moon.\r\nAbout 30,000 have been mapped; but this is only a small portion, for\r\naccording to the American astronomer, Professor W.H. Pickering, there\r\nare more than 200,000 in all.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the crater is the type of mountain\r\nassociated in the mind with the moon, it must not be imagined that upon\r\nour satellite there are no mountains at all of the terrestrial type.\r\nThere are indeed many isolated peaks, but strangely enough they are\r\nnearly always to be found in the centres of craters. Some of these peaks\r\nare of great altitude, that in the centre of the crater Copernicus being\r\nover 11,000 feet high. A few mountain ranges also exist; the best known\r\nof which are styled, the Lunar Alps and Lunar Apennines (see Plate X.,\r\np. 200).\r\n\r\nSince the _mass_ of the moon is only about one-eightieth that of the\r\nearth, it will be understood that the force of gravity which she\r\nexercises is much less. It is calculated that, at her surface, this is\r\nonly about one-sixth of what we experience. A man transported to the\r\nmoon would thus be able to jump _six times as high_ as he can here. A\r\nbuilding could therefore be six times as tall as upon our earth, without\r\ncausing any more strain upon its foundations. It should not, then, be\r\nany subject for wonder, that the highest peaks in the Lunar Apennines\r\nattain to such heights as 22,000 feet. Such a height, upon a\r\ncomparatively small body like the moon, for her _volume_ is only\r\none-fiftieth that of the earth, is relatively very much in excess of the\r\n29,000 feet of Himalayan structure, Mount Everest, the boast of our\r\nplanet, 8000 miles across!\r\n\r\nHigh as are the Lunar Apennines, the highest peaks on the moon are yet\r\nnot found among them. There is, for instance, on the extreme southern\r\nedge of the lunar disc, a range known as the Leibnitz Mountains; several\r\npeaks of which rise to a height of nearly 30,000 feet, one peak in\r\nparticular being said to attain to 36,000 feet (see Plate IX., p. 198).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING REGIONS ON THE MOON\r\n\r\nWe have here (see \"Map,\" Plate IX., p. 198) the mountain ranges of the\r\nApennines, the Caucasus and the Alps; also the craters Plato, Aristotle,\r\nEudoxus, Cassini, Aristillus, Autolycus, Archimedes and Linné. The\r\ncrater Linné is the very bright spot in the dark area at the upper left\r\nhand side of the picture. From a photograph taken at the Paris\r\nObservatory by M.M. Loewy and Puiseux.\r\n\r\n(Page 200)]\r\n\r\nBut the reader will surely ask the question: \"How is it possible to\r\ndetermine the actual height of a lunar mountain, if one cannot go upon\r\nthe moon to measure it?\" The answer is, that we can calculate its height\r\nfrom noting the length of the shadow which it casts. Any one will allow\r\nthat the length of a shadow cast by the sun depends upon two things:\r\nfirstly, upon the height of the object which causes the shadow, and\r\nsecondly, upon the elevation of the sun at the moment in the sky. The\r\nmost casual observer of nature upon our earth can scarcely have failed\r\nto notice that shadows are shortest at noonday, when the sun is at its\r\nhighest in the sky; and that they lengthen out as the sun declines\r\ntowards its setting. Here, then, we have the clue. To ascertain,\r\ntherefore, the height of a lunar mountain, we have first to consider at\r\nwhat elevation the sun is at that moment above the horizon of the place\r\nwhere the mountain in question is situated. Then, having measured the\r\nactual length in miles of the shadow extended before us, all that is\r\nleft is to ask ourselves the question: \"What height must an object be\r\nwhose shadow cast by the sun, when at that elevation in the sky, will\r\nextend to this length?\"\r\n\r\nThere is no trace whatever of water upon the moon. The opinion, indeed,\r\nwhich seems generally held, is that water has never existed upon its\r\nsurface. Erosions, sedimentary deposits, and all those marks which point\r\nto a former occupation by water are notably absent.\r\n\r\nSimilarly there appears to be no atmosphere on the moon; or, at any\r\nrate, such an excessively rare one, as to be quite inappreciable. Of\r\nthis there are several proofs. For instance, in a solar eclipse the\r\nmoon's disc always stands out quite clear-cut against that of the sun.\r\nAgain during occultations, stars disappear behind the moon with a\r\nsuddenness, which could not be the case were there any appreciable\r\natmosphere. Lastly, we see no traces of twilight upon the lunar surface,\r\nnor any softening at the edges of shadows; both which effects would be\r\napparent if there were an atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe moon's surface is rough and rocky, and displays no marks of the\r\n\"weathering\" that would necessarily follow, had it possessed anything of\r\nan atmosphere in the past. This makes us rather inclined to doubt that\r\nit ever had one at all. Supposing, however, that it did possess an\r\natmosphere in the past, it is interesting to inquire what may have\r\nbecome of it. In the first place it might have gradually disappeared, in\r\nconsequence of the gases which composed it uniting chemically with the\r\nmaterials of which the lunar body is constructed; or, again, its\r\nconstituent gases may have escaped into space, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of that kinetic theory of which we have already spoken. The\r\nlatter solution seems, indeed, the most reasonable of the two, for the\r\nforce of gravity at the lunar surface appears too weak to hold down any\r\nknown gases. This argument seems also to dispose of the question of\r\nabsence of water; for Dr. George Johnstone Stoney, in a careful\r\ninvestigation of the subject, has shown that the liquid in question,\r\nwhen in the form of vapour, will escape from a planet if its mass is\r\nless than _one-fourth_ that of our earth. And the mass of the moon is\r\nvery much less than this; indeed only the _one-eightieth_, as we have\r\nalready stated.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this lack of atmosphere, the condition of things upon\r\nthe moon will be in marked contrast to what we experience upon the\r\nearth. The atmosphere here performs a double service in shielding us\r\nfrom the direct rays of the sun, and in bottling the heat as a\r\nglass-house does. On the moon, however, the sun beats down in the\r\nday-time with a merciless force; but its rays are reflected away from\r\nthe surface as quickly as they are received, and so the cold of the\r\nlunar night is excessive. It has been calculated that the day\r\ntemperature on the moon may, indeed, be as high as our boiling-point,\r\nwhile the night temperature may be more than twice as low as the\r\ngreatest cold known in our arctic regions.\r\n\r\nThat a certain amount of solar heat is reflected to us from the moon is\r\nshown by the sharp drop in temperature which certain heat-measuring\r\ninstruments record when the moon becomes obscured in a lunar eclipse.\r\nThe solar heat which is thus reflected to us by the moon is, however, on\r\nthe whole extremely small; more light and heat, indeed, reach us\r\n_direct_ from the sun in half a minute than we get by _reflection_ from\r\nthe moon during the entire course of the year.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the origin of the lunar craters there has been much\r\ndiscussion. Some have considered them to be evidence of violent volcanic\r\naction in the dim past; others, again, as the result of the impact of\r\nmeteorites upon the lunar surface, when the moon was still in a plastic\r\ncondition; while a third theory holds that they were formed by the\r\nbursting of huge bubbles during the escape into space of gases from the\r\ninterior. The question is, indeed, a very difficult one. Though\r\nvolcanic action, such as would result in craters of the size of\r\nPtolemæus, is hard for us to picture, and though the lone peaks which\r\nadorn the centres of many craters have nothing reminiscent of them in\r\nour terrestrial volcanoes, nevertheless the volcanic theory seems to\r\nreceive more favour than the others.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the craters there are two more features which demand\r\nnotice, namely, what are known as _rays_ and _rills_. The rays are long,\r\nlight-coloured streaks which radiate from several of the large craters,\r\nand extend to a distance of some hundreds of miles. That they are mere\r\nmarkings on the surface is proved by the fact that they cast no shadows\r\nof any kind. One theory is, that they were originally great cracks which\r\nhave been filled with lighter coloured material, welling up from\r\nbeneath. The rills, on the other hand, are actually fissures, about a\r\nmile or so in width and about a quarter of a mile in depth.\r\n\r\nThe rays are seen to the best advantage in connection with the craters\r\nTycho and Copernicus (see Plate XI., p. 204). In consequence of its\r\nfairly forward position on the lunar disc, and of the remarkable system\r\nof rays which issue from it like spokes from the axle of a wheel, Tycho\r\ncommands especial attention. The late Rev. T.W. Webb, a famous observer,\r\nchristened it, very happily, the \"metropolitan crater of the moon.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI. THE MOON\r\n\r\nThe systems of rays from the craters Tycho, Copernicus and Kepler are\r\nwell shown here. From a photograph taken at the Paris Observatory by\r\nM.P. Puiseux.\r\n\r\n(Page 204)]\r\n\r\nA great deal of attention is, and has been, paid by certain astronomers\r\nto the moon, in the hope of finding out if any changes are actually in\r\nprogress at present upon her surface. Sir William Herschel, indeed, once\r\nthought that he saw a lunar volcano in eruption, but this proved to be\r\nmerely the effect of the sunlight striking the top of the crater\r\nAristarchus, while the region around it was still in shadow--sunrise\r\nupon Aristarchus, in fact! No change of any real importance has,\r\nhowever, been noted, although it is suspected that some minor\r\nalterations have from time to time taken place. For instance, slight\r\nvariations of tint have been noticed in certain areas of the lunar\r\nsurface. Professor W.H. Pickering puts forward the conjecture that these\r\nmay be caused by the growth and decay of some low form of vegetation,\r\nbrought into existence by vapours of water, or carbonic acid gas, making\r\ntheir way out from the interior through cracks near at hand.\r\n\r\nAgain, during the last hundred years one small crater known as Linné\r\n(Linnæus), situated in the Mare Serenitatis (Sea of Serenity), has\r\nappeared to undergo slight changes, and is even said to have been\r\ninvisible for a while (see Plate X., p. 200). It is, however, believed\r\nthat the changes in question may be due to the varying angles at which\r\nthe sunlight falls upon the crater; for it is an understood fact that\r\nthe irregularities of the moon's motion give us views of her surface\r\nwhich always differ slightly.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion has more than once been put forward that the surface of\r\nthe moon is covered with a thick layer of ice. This is generally\r\nconsidered improbable, and consequently the idea has received very\r\nlittle support. It first originated with the late Mr. S.E. Peal, an\r\nEnglish observer of the moon, and has recently been resuscitated by the\r\nGerman observer, Herr Fauth.\r\n\r\nThe most unfavourable time for telescopic study of the moon is when she\r\nis full. The sunlight is then falling directly upon her visible\r\nhemisphere, and so the mountains cast no shadows. We thus do not get\r\nthat impression of hill and hollow which is so very noticeable in the\r\nother phases.\r\n\r\nThe first map of the moon was constructed by Galileo. Tobias Mayer\r\npublished another in 1775; while during the nineteenth century greatly\r\nimproved ones were made by Beer and Mädler, Schmidt, Neison and others.\r\nIn 1903, Professor W.H. Pickering brought out a complete photographic\r\nlunar atlas; and a similar publication has recently appeared, the work\r\nof MM. Loewy and Puiseux of the Observatory of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"seas\" of the moon are, as we have seen, merely dark\r\nareas, and there appears to be no proof that they were ever occupied by\r\nany liquid. They are for the most part found in the _northern_ portion\r\nof the moon; a striking contrast to our seas and oceans, which take up\r\nso much of the _southern_ hemisphere of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere are many erroneous ideas popularly held with regard to certain\r\ninfluences which the moon is supposed to exercise upon the earth. For\r\ninstance, a change in the weather is widely believed to depend upon a\r\nchange in the moon. But the word \"change\" as here used is meaningless,\r\nfor the moon is continually changing her phase during the whole of her\r\nmonthly round. Besides, the moon is visible over a great portion of the\r\nearth _at the same moment_, and certainly all the places from which it\r\ncan then be seen do not get the same weather! Further, careful\r\nobservations, and records extending over the past one hundred years and\r\nmore, fail to show any reliable connection between the phases of the\r\nmoon and the condition of the weather.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, on very good authority, that no telescope ever shows\r\nthe surface of the moon as clearly as we could see it with the naked eye\r\nwere it only 240 miles distant from us.\r\n\r\nSupposing, then, that we were able to approach our satellite, and view\r\nit without optical aid at such comparatively close quarters, it is\r\ninteresting to consider what would be the smallest detail which our eye\r\ncould take in. The question of the limit of what can be appreciated with\r\nthe naked eye is somewhat uncertain, but it appears safe to say that at\r\na distance of 240 miles the _minutest speck_ visible would have to be\r\n_at least_ some 60 yards across.\r\n\r\nAtmosphere and liquid both wanting, the lunar surface must be the seat\r\nof an eternal calm; where no sound breaks the stillness and where\r\nchange, as we know it, does not exist. The sun beats down upon the arid\r\nrocks, and inky shadows lie athwart the valleys. There is no mellowing\r\nof the harsh contrasts.\r\n\r\nWe cannot indeed absolutely affirm that Life has no place at all upon\r\nthis airless and waterless globe, since we know not under what strange\r\nconditions it may manifest its presence; and our most powerful\r\ntelescopes, besides, do not bring the lunar surface sufficiently near to\r\nus to disprove the existence there of even such large creatures as\r\ndisport themselves upon our planet. Still, we find it hard to rid\r\nourselves of the feeling that we are in the presence of a dead world. On\r\nshe swings around the earth month after month, with one face ever\r\nturned towards us, leaving a certain mystery to hang around that hidden\r\nside, the greater part of which men can never hope to see. The rotation\r\nof the moon upon her axis--the lunar day--has become, as we have seen,\r\nequal to her revolution around the earth. An epoch may likewise\r\neventually be reached in the history of our own planet, when the length\r\nof the terrestrial day has been so slowed down by tidal friction that it\r\nwill be equal to the year. Then will the earth revolve around the\r\ncentral orb, with one side plunged in eternal night and the other in\r\neternal sunshine. But such a vista need not immediately distress us. It\r\nis millions of years forward in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] _Journal of the British Astronomical Association_, vol. x.\r\n(1899-1900), Nos. 1 and 3.\r\n\r\n[15] Certain of the ancient Greeks thought the markings on the moon to\r\nbe merely the reflection of the seas and lands of our earth, as in a\r\nbadly polished mirror.\r\n\r\n[16] Mare Imbrium, Sinus Iridum, Lacus Somniorum.\r\n\r\n[17] The lunar craters have, as a rule, received their names from\r\ncelebrated persons, usually men of science. This system of nomenclature\r\nwas originated by Riccioli, in 1651.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERIOR PLANETS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving, in a previous chapter, noted the various aspects which an\r\ninferior planet presents to our view, in consequence of its orbit being\r\nnearer to the sun than the orbit of the earth, it will be well here to\r\nconsider in the same way the case of a superior planet, and to mark\r\ncarefully the difference.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it should be quite evident that we cannot ever have a\r\ntransit of a superior planet. The orbit of such a body being entirely\r\n_outside_ that of the earth, the body itself can, of course, never pass\r\nbetween us and the sun.\r\n\r\nA superior planet will be at its greatest distance from us when on the\r\nfar side of the sun. It is said then to be in _conjunction_. As it comes\r\nround in its orbit it eventually passes, so to speak, at the _back_ of\r\nus. It is then at its nearest, or in _opposition_, as this is\r\ntechnically termed, and therefore in the most favourable position for\r\ntelescopic observation of its surface. Being, besides, seen by us at\r\nthat time in the direction of the heavens exactly opposite to where the\r\nsun is, it will thus at midnight be high up in the south side of the\r\nsky, a further advantage to the observer.\r\n\r\nLast of all, a superior planet cannot show crescent shapes like an\r\ninterior; for whether it be on the far side of the sun, or behind us,\r\nor again to our right or left, the sunlight must needs appear to fall\r\nmore or less full upon its face.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETOID EROS\r\n\r\nThe nearest to us of the superior planets is the tiny body, Eros, which,\r\nas has been already stated, was discovered so late as the year 1898. In\r\npoint of view, however, of its small size, it can hardly be considered\r\nas a true planet, and the name \"planetoid\" seems much more appropriate\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nEros was not discovered, like Uranus, in the course of telescopic\r\nexamination of the heavens, nor yet, like Neptune, as the direct result\r\nof difficult calculations, but was revealed by the impress of its light\r\nupon a photographic plate, which had been exposed for some length of\r\ntime to the starry sky. Since many of the more recent additions to the\r\nasteroids have been discovered in the same manner, we shall have\r\nsomewhat more to say about this special employment of photography when\r\nwe come to deal with those bodies later on.\r\n\r\nThe path of Eros around the sun is so very elliptical, or, to use the\r\nexact technical term, so very \"eccentric,\" that the planetoid does not\r\nkeep all the time entirely in the space between our orbit and that of\r\nMars, which latter happens to be the next body in the order of planetary\r\nsuccession outwards. In portions of its journey Eros, indeed, actually\r\ngoes outside the Martian orbit. The paths of the planetoid and of Mars\r\nare, however, _not upon the same plane_, so the bodies always pass clear\r\nof each other, and there is thus as little chance of their dashing\r\ntogether as there would be of trains which run across a bridge at an\r\nupper level, colliding with those which pass beneath it at a lower\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nWhen Eros is in opposition, it comes within about 13-1/2 million miles\r\nof our earth, and, after the moon, is therefore by a long way our\r\nnearest neighbour in space. It is, however, extremely small, not more,\r\nperhaps, than twenty miles in diameter, and is subject to marked\r\nvariations in brightness, which do not appear up to the present to meet\r\nwith a satisfactory explanation. But, insignificant as is this little\r\nbody, it is of great importance to astronomy; for it happens to furnish\r\nthe best method known of calculating the sun's distance from our\r\nearth--a method which Galle, in 1872, and Sir David Gill, in 1877,\r\nsuggested that asteroids might be employed for, and which has in\r\nconsequence supplanted the old one founded upon transits of Venus. The\r\nsun's distance is now an ascertained fact to within 100,000 miles, or\r\nless than half the distance of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANET MARS\r\n\r\nWe next come to the planet Mars. This body rotates in a period of\r\nslightly more than twenty-four hours. The inclination, or slant, of its\r\naxis is about the same as that of the earth, so that, putting aside its\r\ngreater distance from the sun, the variations of season which it\r\nexperiences ought to be very much like ours.\r\n\r\nThe first marking detected upon Mars was the notable one called the\r\nSyrtis Major, also known, on account of its shape, as the Hour-Glass\r\nSea. This observation was made by the famous Huyghens in 1659; and, from\r\nthe movement of the marking in question across the disc, he inferred\r\nthat the planet rotated on its axis in a period of about twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be very little atmosphere upon Mars, the result being\r\nthat we almost always obtain a clear view of the detail on its surface.\r\nIndeed, it is only to be expected from the kinetic theory that Mars\r\ncould not retain much of an atmosphere, as the force of gravity at its\r\nsurface is less than one-half of what we experience upon the earth. It\r\nshould here be mentioned that recent researches with the spectroscope\r\nseem to show that, whatever atmosphere there may be upon Mars, its\r\ndensity at the surface of the planet cannot be more than the one-fourth\r\npart of the density of the air at the surface of the earth. Professor\r\nLowell, indeed, thinks it may be more rarefied than that upon our\r\nhighest mountain-tops.\r\n\r\nSeen with the naked eye, Mars appears of a red colour. Viewed in the\r\ntelescope, its surface is found to be in general of a ruddy hue, varied\r\nhere and there with darker patches of a bluish-green colour. These\r\nmarkings are permanent, and were supposed by the early telescopic\r\nobservers to imply a distribution of the planet's surface into land and\r\nwater, the ruddy portions being considered as continental areas (perhaps\r\nsandy deserts), and the bluish-green as seas. The similarity to our\r\nearth thus suggested was further heightened by the fact that broad white\r\ncaps, situated at the poles, were seen to vary with the planet's\r\nseasons, diminishing greatly in extent during the Martian summer (the\r\nsouthern cap in 1894 even disappearing altogether), and developing again\r\nin the Martian winter.[18] Readers of Oliver Wendell Holmes will no\r\ndoubt recollect that poet's striking lines:--\r\n\r\n\"The snows that glittered on the disc of Mars\r\nHave melted, and the planet's fiery orb\r\nRolls in the crimson summer of its year.\"\r\n\r\nA state of things so strongly analogous to what we experience here,\r\nnaturally fired the imaginations of men, and caused them to look on Mars\r\nas a world like ours, only upon a much smaller scale. Being smaller, it\r\nwas concluded to have cooled quicker, and to be now long past its prime;\r\nand its \"inhabitants\" were, therefore, pictured as at a later stage of\r\ndevelopment than the inhabitants of our earth.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the strong temptation to assume that the whiteness of\r\nthe Martian polar caps is due to fallen snow, such a solution is,\r\nhowever, by no means so simple as it looks. The deposition of water in\r\nthe form of snow, or even of hoar frost, would at least imply that the\r\natmosphere of Mars should now and then display traces of aqueous vapour,\r\nwhich it does not appear to do.[19] It has, indeed, been suggested that\r\nthe whiteness may not after all be due to this cause, but to carbonic\r\nacid gas (carbon dioxide), which is known to freeze at a _very low_\r\ntemperature. The suggestion is plainly based upon the assumption that,\r\nas Mars is so much further from the sun than we are, it would receive\r\nmuch less heat, and that the little thus received would be quickly\r\nradiated away into space through lack of atmosphere to bottle it in.\r\n\r\nWe now come to those well-known markings, popularly known as the\r\n\"canals\" of Mars, which have been the subject of so much discussion\r\nsince their discovery thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, in the year 1877, when Mars was in opposition, and thus\r\nat its nearest to us, that the famous Italian astronomer, Schiaparelli,\r\nannounced to the world that he had found that the ruddy areas, thought\r\nto be continents, were intersected by a network of straight dark lines.\r\nThese lines, he reported, appeared in many cases to be of great length,\r\nso long, indeed, as several thousands of miles, and from about twenty to\r\nsixty miles in width. He christened the lines _channels_, the Italian\r\nword for which, \"canali,\" was unfortunately translated into English as\r\n\"canals.\" The analogy, thus accidentally suggested, gave rise to the\r\nidea that they might be actual waterways.[20]\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1881-1882, when Mars was again in opposition,\r\nSchiaparelli further announced that he had found some of these lines\r\ndoubled; that is to say, certain of them were accompanied by similar\r\nlines running exactly parallel at no great distance away. There was at\r\nfirst a good deal of scepticism on the subject of Schiaparelli's\r\ndiscoveries, but gradually other observers found themselves seeing both\r\nthe lines and their doublings. We have in this a good example of a\r\ncurious circumstance in astronomical observation, namely, the fact that\r\nwhen fine detail has once been noted by a competent observer, it is not\r\nlong before other observers see the same detail with ease.\r\n\r\nAn immense amount of close attention has been paid to the planet Mars\r\nduring recent years by the American observer, Professor Percival Lowell,\r\nat his famous observatory, 7300 feet above the sea, near the town of\r\nFlagstaff, Arizona, U.S.A. His observations have not, like those of most\r\nastronomers, been confined merely to \"oppositions,\" but he has\r\nsystematically kept the planet in view, so far as possible, since the\r\nyear 1894.\r\n\r\nThe instrumental equipment of his observatory is of the very best, and\r\nthe \"seeing\" at Flagstaff is described as excellent. In support of the\r\nlatter statement, Mr. Lampland, of the Lowell Observatory, maintains\r\nthat the faintest stars shown on charts made at the Lick Observatory\r\nwith the 36-inch telescope there, are _perfectly visible_ with the\r\n24-inch telescope at Flagstaff.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lowell is, indeed, generally at issue with the other observers\r\nof Mars. He finds the canals extremely narrow and sharply defined, and\r\nhe attributes the blurred and hazy appearance, which they have presented\r\nto other astronomers, to the unsteady and imperfect atmospheric\r\nconditions in which their observations have been made. He assigns to the\r\nthinnest a width of two or three miles, and from fifteen to twenty to\r\nthe larger. Relatively to their width, however, he finds their length\r\nenormous. Many of them are 2000 miles long, while one is even as much\r\nas 3540. Such lengths as these are very great in comparison with the\r\nsmallness of the planet. He considers that the canals stand in some\r\npeculiar relation to the polar cap, for they crowd together in its\r\nneighbourhood. In place, too, of ill-defined condensations, he sees\r\nsharp black spots where the canals meet and intersect, and to these he\r\ngives the name of \"Oases.\" He further lays particular stress upon a dark\r\nband of a blue tint, which is always seen closely to surround the edges\r\nof the polar caps all the time that they are disappearing; and this he\r\ntakes to be a proof that the white material is something which actually\r\n_melts_. Of all substances which we know, water alone, he affirms, would\r\nact in such a manner.\r\n\r\nThe question of melting at all may seem strange in a planet which is\r\nsituated so far from the sun, and possesses such a rarefied atmosphere.\r\nBut Professor Lowell considers that this very thinness of the atmosphere\r\nallows the direct solar rays to fall with great intensity upon the\r\nplanet's surface, and that this heating effect is accentuated by the\r\ngreat length of the Martian summer. In consequence he concludes that,\r\nalthough the general climate of Mars is decidedly cold, it is above the\r\nfreezing point of water.\r\n\r\nThe observations at Flagstaff appear to do away with the old idea that\r\nthe darkish areas are seas, for numerous lines belonging to the\r\nso-called \"canal system\" are seen to traverse them. Again, there is no\r\nstar-like image of the sun reflected from them, as there would be, of\r\ncourse, from the surface of a great sheet of water. Lastly, they are\r\nobserved to vary in tone and colour with the changing Martian seasons,\r\nthe blue-green changing into ochre, and later on back again into\r\nblue-green. Professor Lowell regards these areas as great tracts of\r\nvegetation, which are brought into activity as the liquid reaches them\r\nfrom the melting snows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII. A MAP OF THE PLANET MARS\r\n\r\nWe see here the Syrtis Major (or \"Hour-Glass Sea\"), the polar caps,\r\nseveral \"oases,\" and a large number of \"canals,\" some of which are\r\ndouble. The South is at the top of the picture, in accordance with the\r\n_inverted_ view given by an astronomical telescope. From a drawing by\r\nProfessor Percival Lowell.\r\n\r\n(Page 216)]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the canals, the Lowell observations further inform us\r\nthat these are invisible during the Martian winter, but begin to appear\r\nin the spring when the polar cap is disappearing. Professor Lowell,\r\ntherefore, inclines to the view that in the middle of the so-called\r\ncanals there exist actual waterways which serve the purposes of\r\nirrigation, and that what we see is not the waterways themselves, for\r\nthey are too narrow, but the fringe of vegetation which springs up along\r\nthe banks as the liquid is borne through them from the melting of the\r\npolar snows. He supports this by his observation that the canals begin\r\nto appear in the neighbourhood of the polar caps, and gradually grow, as\r\nit were, in the direction of the planet's equator.\r\n\r\nIt is the idea of life on Mars which has given this planet such a\r\nfascination in the eyes of men. A great deal of nonsense has, however,\r\nbeen written in newspapers upon the subject, and many persons have thus\r\nbeen led to think that we have obtained some actual evidence of the\r\nexistence of living beings upon Mars. It must be clearly understood,\r\nhowever, that Professor Lowell's advocacy of the existence of life upon\r\nthat planet is by no means of this wild order. At the best he merely\r\nindulges in such theories as his remarkable observations naturally call\r\nforth. His views are as follows:--He considers that the planet has\r\nreached a time when \"water\" has become so scarce that the \"inhabitants\"\r\nare obliged to employ their utmost skill to make their scanty supply\r\nsuffice for purposes of irrigation. The changes of tone and colour upon\r\nthe Martian surface, as the irrigation produces its effects, are similar\r\nto what a telescopic observer--say, upon Venus--would notice on our\r\nearth when the harvest ripens over huge tracts of country; that is, of\r\ncourse, if the earth's atmosphere allowed a clear view of the\r\nterrestrial surface--a very doubtful point indeed. Professor Lowell\r\nthinks that the perfect straightness of the lines, and the geometrical\r\nmanner in which they are arranged, are clear evidences of artificiality.\r\nOn a globe, too, there is plainly no reason why the liquid which results\r\nfrom the melting of the polar caps should trend at all in the direction\r\nof the equator. Upon our earth, for instance, the transference of water,\r\nas in rivers, merely follows the slope of the ground, and nothing else.\r\nThe Lowell observations show, however, that the Martian liquid is\r\napparently carried from one pole towards the equator, and then past it\r\nto the other pole, where it once more freezes, only to melt again in due\r\nseason, and to reverse the process towards and across the equator as\r\nbefore. Professor Lowell therefore holds, and it seems a strong point in\r\nfavour of his theory, that the liquid must, in some artificial manner,\r\nas by pumping, for instance, be _helped_ in its passage across the\r\nsurface of the planet.\r\n\r\nA number of attempts have been made to explain the _doubling_ of the\r\ncanals merely as effects of refraction or reflection; and it has even\r\nbeen suggested that it may arise from the telescope not being accurately\r\nfocussed.\r\n\r\nThe actual doubling of the canals once having been doubted, it was an\r\neasy step to the casting of doubt on the reality of the canals\r\nthemselves. The idea, indeed, was put forward that the human eye, in\r\ndealing with detail so very close to the limit of visibility, may\r\nunconsciously treat as an actual line several point-like markings which\r\nmerely happen to lie in a line. In order to test this theory,\r\nexperiments were carried out in 1902 by Mr. E.W. Maunder of Greenwich\r\nObservatory, and Mr. J.E. Evans of the Royal Hospital School at\r\nGreenwich, in which certain schoolboys were set to make drawings of a\r\nwhite disc with some faint markings upon it. The boys were placed at\r\nvarious distances from the disc in question; and it was found that the\r\ndrawings made by those who were just too far off to see distinctly, bore\r\nout the above theory in a remarkable manner. Recently, however, the\r\nplausibility of the _illusion_ view has been shaken by photographs of\r\nMars taken during the opposition of 1905 by Mr. Lampland at the Lowell\r\nObservatory, in which a number of the more prominent canals come out as\r\nstraight dark lines. Further still, in some photographs made there quite\r\nlately, several canals are said to appear visibly double.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the idea alluded to in Chapter XVI., that the moon may be\r\ncovered with a layer of ice, Mr. W.T. Lynn has recently suggested that\r\nthis may be the case on Mars; and that, at certain seasons, the water\r\nmay break through along definite lines, and even along lines parallel to\r\nthese. This, he maintains, would account for the canals becoming\r\ngradually visible across the disc, without the necessity of Professor\r\nLowell's \"pumping\" theory.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the views of Professor Lowell himself with regard to the\r\ndoubling of the canals. From his observations, he considers that no\r\npairs of railway lines could apparently be laid down with greater\r\nparallelism. He draws attention to the fact that the doubling does not\r\ntake place by any means in every canal; indeed, out of 400 canals seen\r\nat Flagstaff, only fifty-one--or, roughly, one-eighth--have at any time\r\nbeen seen double. He lays great stress upon this, which he considers\r\npoints strongly against the duplication being an optical phenomenon. He\r\nfinds that the distance separating pairs of canals is much less in some\r\ndoubles than in others, and varies on the whole from 75 to 200 miles.\r\nAccording to him, the double canals appear to be confined to within 40\r\ndegrees of the equator: or, to quote his own words, they are \"an\r\nequatorial feature of the planet, confined to the tropic and temperate\r\nbelts.\" Finally, he points out that they seem to _avoid_ the blue-green\r\nareas. But, strangely enough, Professor Lowell does not so far attempt\r\nto fit in the doubling with his body of theory. He makes the obvious\r\nremark that they may be \"channels and return channels,\" and with that he\r\nleaves us.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of Professor Lowell have recently been subjected to\r\nstrenuous criticism by Professor W.H. Pickering and Dr. Alfred Russel\r\nWallace. It was Professor Pickering who discovered the \"oases,\" and who\r\noriginated the idea that we did not see the so-called \"canals\"\r\nthemselves, but only the growth of vegetation along their borders. He\r\nholds that the oases are craterlets, and that the canals are cracks\r\nwhich radiate from them, as do the rifts and streaks from craters upon\r\nthe moon. He goes on to suggest that vapours of water, or of carbonic\r\nacid gas, escaping from the interior, find their way out through these\r\ncracks, and promote the growth of a low form of vegetation on either\r\nside of them. In support of this view he draws attention to the\r\nexistence of long \"steam-cracks,\" bordered by vegetation, in the deserts\r\nof the highly volcanic island of Hawaii. We have already seen, in an\r\nearlier chapter, how he has applied this idea to the explanation of\r\ncertain changes which are suspected to be taking place upon the moon.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the Lowell canal system, Professor Pickering points out\r\nthat under such a slight atmospheric pressure as exists on Mars, the\r\nevaporation of the polar caps--supposing them to be formed of\r\nsnow--would take place with such extraordinary rapidity that the\r\nresulting water could never be made to travel along open channels, but\r\nthat a system of gigantic tubes or water-mains would have to be\r\nemployed!\r\n\r\nAs will be gathered from his theories regarding vegetation, Professor\r\nPickering does not deny the existence of a form of life upon Mars. But\r\nhe will not hear of civilisation, or of anything even approaching it. He\r\nthinks, however, that as Mars is intermediate physically between the\r\nmoon and earth, the form of life which it supports may be higher than\r\nthat on the moon and lower than that on the earth.\r\n\r\nIn a small book published in the latter part of 1907, and entitled _Is\r\nMars Habitable?_ Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace sets himself, among other\r\nthings, to combat the idea of a comparatively high temperature, such as\r\nProfessor Lowell has allotted to Mars. He shows the immense service\r\nwhich the water-vapour in our atmosphere exercises, through keeping the\r\nsolar heat from escaping from the earth's surface. He then draws\r\nattention to the fact that there is no spectroscopic evidence of\r\nwater-vapour on Mars[21]; and points out that its absence is only to be\r\nexpected, as Dr. George Johnstone Stoney has shown that it will escape\r\nfrom a body whose mass is less than one-quarter the mass of the earth.\r\nThe mass of Mars is, in fact, much less than this, _i.e._ only\r\none-ninth. Dr. Wallace considers, therefore, that the temperature of\r\nMars ought to be extremely low, unless the constitution of its\r\natmosphere is very different from ours. With regard to the latter\r\nstatement, it should be mentioned that the Swedish physicist, Arrhenius,\r\nhas recently shown that the carbonic acid gas in our atmosphere has an\r\nimportant influence upon climate. The amount of it in our air is, as we\r\nhave seen, extremely small; but Arrhenius shows that, if it were\r\ndoubled, the temperature would be more uniform and much higher. We thus\r\nsee how futile it is, with our present knowledge, to dogmatise on the\r\nexistence or non-existence of life in other celestial orbs.\r\n\r\nAs to the canals Dr. Wallace puts forward a theory of his own. He\r\ncontends that after Mars had cooled to a state of solidity, a great\r\nswarm of meteorites and small asteroids fell in upon it, with the result\r\nthat a thin molten layer was formed all over the planet. As this layer\r\ncooled, the imprisoned gases escaped, producing vents or craterlets; and\r\nas it attempted to contract further upon the solid interior, it split in\r\nfissures radiating from points of weakness, such, for instance, as the\r\ncraterlets. And he goes on to suggest that the two tiny Martian\r\nsatellites, with which we shall deal next, are the last survivors of his\r\nhypothetical swarm. Finally, with regard to the habitability of Mars,\r\nDr. Wallace not only denies it, but asserts that the planet is\r\n\"absolutely uninhabitable.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time it was supposed that Mars did not possess any\r\nsatellites. In 1877, however, during that famous opposition in which\r\nSchiaparelli first saw the canals, two tiny satellites were discovered\r\nat the Washington Observatory by an American astronomer, Professor Asaph\r\nHall. These satellites are so minute, and so near to the planet, that\r\nthey can only be seen with very large telescopes; and even then the\r\nbright disc of the planet must be shielded off. They have been\r\nchristened Phobos and Deimos (Fear and Dread); these being the names of\r\nthe two subordinate deities who, according to Homer, attended upon Mars,\r\nthe god of war.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to measure the exact sizes of these satellites, as they\r\nare too small to show any discs, but an estimate has been formed from\r\ntheir brightness. The diameter of Phobos was at first thought to be six\r\nmiles, and that of Deimos, seven. As later estimates, however,\r\nconsiderably exceed this, it will, perhaps, be not far from the truth to\r\nstate that they are each roughly about the size of the planetoid Eros.\r\nPhobos revolves around Mars in about 7-1/2 hours, at a distance of about\r\nonly 4000 miles from the planet's surface, and Deimos in about 30 hours,\r\nat a distance of about 12,000 miles. As Mars rotates on its axis in\r\nabout 24 hours, it will be seen that Phobos makes more than three\r\nrevolutions while the planet is rotating once--a very interesting\r\ncondition of things.\r\n\r\nA strange foreshadowing of the discovery of the satellites of Mars will\r\nbe familiar to readers of _Gulliver's Travels_. According to Dean\r\nSwift's hero, the astronomers on the Flying Island of Laputa had found\r\ntwo tiny satellites to Mars, one of which revolved around the planet in\r\nten hours. The correctness of this guess is extraordinarily close,\r\nthough at best it is, of course, nothing more than a pure coincidence.\r\n\r\nIt need not be at all surprising that much uncertainty should exist with\r\nregard to the actual condition of the surface of Mars. The circumstances\r\nin which we are able to see that planet at the best are, indeed, hardly\r\nsufficient to warrant us in propounding any hard and fast theories. One\r\nof the most experienced of living observers, the American astronomer,\r\nProfessor E.E. Barnard, considers that the view we get of Mars with the\r\nbest telescope may be fairly compared with our naked eye view of the\r\nmoon. Since we have seen that a view with quite a small telescope\r\nentirely alters our original idea of the lunar surface, a slight\r\nmagnification revealing features of whose existence we had not\r\npreviously the slightest conception, it does not seem too much to say\r\nthat a further improvement in optical power might entirely subvert the\r\npresent notions with regard to the Martian canals. Therefore, until we\r\nget a still nearer view of these strange markings, it seems somewhat\r\nfutile to theorise. The lines which we see are perhaps, indeed, a\r\nforeshortened and all too dim view of some type of formation entirely\r\nnovel to us, and possibly peculiar to Mars. Differences of gravity and\r\nother conditions, such as obtain upon different planets, may perhaps\r\nproduce very diverse results. The earth, the moon, and Mars differ\r\ngreatly from one another in size, gravitation, and other such\r\ncharacteristics. Mountain-ranges so far appear typical of our globe, and\r\nring-mountains typical of the moon. May not the so-called \"canals\" be\r\nmerely some special formation peculiar to Mars, though quite a natural\r\nresult of its particular conditions and of its past history?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASTEROIDS (OR MINOR PLANETS)\r\n\r\nWe now come to that belt of small planets which are known by the name of\r\nasteroids. In the general survey of the solar system given in Chapter\r\nII., we saw how it was long ago noticed that the distances of the\r\nplanetary orbits from the sun would have presented a marked appearance\r\nof orderly sequence, were it not for a gap between the orbits of Mars\r\nand Jupiter where no large planet was known to circulate. The suspicion\r\nthus aroused that some planet might, after all, be moving in this\r\nseemingly empty space, gave rise to the gradual discovery of a great\r\nnumber of small bodies; the largest of which, Ceres, is less than 500\r\nmiles in diameter. Up to the present day some 600 of these bodies have\r\nbeen discovered; the four leading ones, in order of size, being named\r\nCeres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta. All the asteroids are invisible to the\r\nnaked eye, with the exception of Vesta, which, though by no means the\r\nlargest, happens to be the brightest. It is, however, only just visible\r\nto the eye under favourable conditions. No trace of an atmosphere has\r\nbeen noted upon any of the asteroids, but such a state of things is only\r\nto be expected from the kinetic theory.\r\n\r\nFor a good many years the discoveries of asteroids were made by means of\r\nthe telescope. When, in the course of searching the heavens, an object\r\nwas noticed which did not appear upon any of the recognised star charts,\r\nit was kept under observation for several nights to see whether it\r\nchanged its place in the sky. Since asteroids move around the sun in\r\norbits, just as planets do, they, of course, quickly reveal themselves\r\nby their change of position against the starry background.\r\n\r\nThe year 1891 started a new era in the discovery of asteroids. It\r\noccurred to the Heidelberg observer, Dr. Max Wolf, one of the most\r\nfamous of the hunters of these tiny planets, that photography might be\r\nemployed in the quest with success. This photographic method, to which\r\nallusion has already been made in dealing with Eros, is an extremely\r\nsimple one. If a photograph of a portion of the heavens be taken through\r\nan \"equatorial\"--that is, a telescope, moving by machinery, so as to\r\nkeep the stars, at which it is pointed, always exactly in the field of\r\nview during their apparent movement across the sky--the images of these\r\nstars will naturally come out in the photograph as sharply defined\r\npoints. If, however, there happens to be an asteroid, or other planetary\r\nbody, in the same field of view, its image will come out as a short\r\nwhite streak; because the body has a comparatively rapid motion of its\r\nown, and will, during the period of exposure, have moved sufficiently\r\nagainst the background of the stars to leave a short trail, instead of a\r\ndot, upon the photographic plate. By this method Wolf himself has\r\nsucceeded in discovering more than a hundred asteroids (see Plate XIII.,\r\np. 226). It was, indeed, a little streak of this kind, appearing upon a\r\nphotograph taken by the astronomer Witt, at Berlin, in 1898, which first\r\ninformed the world of the existence of Eros.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII. MINOR PLANET TRAILS\r\n\r\nTwo trails of minor planets (asteroids) imprinted _at the same time_\r\nupon one photographic plate. In the white streak on the left-hand side\r\nof the picture we witness the _discovery_ of a new minor planet. The\r\nstreak on the right was made by a body already known--the minor planet\r\n\"Fiducia.\" This photograph was taken by Dr. Max Wolf, at Heidelberg, on\r\nthe 4th of November, 1901, with the aid of a 16-inch telescope. The time\r\nof exposure was two hours.\r\n\r\n(Page 227)]\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the total mass of the asteroids must be\r\nmuch less than one-quarter that of the earth. They circulate as a rule\r\nwithin a space of some 30,000,000 miles in breadth, lying about midway\r\nbetween the paths of Mars and Jupiter. Two or three, however, of the\r\nmost recently discovered of these small bodies have been found to pass\r\nquite close to Jupiter. The orbits of the asteroids are by no means in\r\nthe one plane, that of Pallas being the most inclined to the plane of\r\nthe earth's orbit. It is actually three times as much inclined as that\r\nof Eros.\r\n\r\nTwo notable theories have been put forward to account for the origin of\r\nthe asteroids. The first is that of the celebrated German astronomer,\r\nOlbers, who was the discoverer of Pallas and Vesta. He suggested that\r\nthey were the fragments of an exploded planet. This theory was for a\r\ntime generally accepted, but has now been abandoned in consequence of\r\ncertain definite objections. The most important of these objections is\r\nthat, in accordance with the theory of gravitation, the orbits of such\r\nfragments would all have to pass through the place where the explosion\r\noriginally occurred. But the wide area over which the asteroids are\r\nspread points rather against the notion that they all set out originally\r\nfrom one particular spot. Another objection is that it does not appear\r\npossible that, within a planet already formed, forces could originate\r\nsufficiently powerful to tear the body asunder.\r\n\r\nThe second theory is that for some reason a planet here failed in the\r\nmaking. Possibly the powerful gravitational action of the huge body of\r\nJupiter hard by, disturbed this region so much that the matter\r\ndistributed through it was never able to collect itself into a single\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[18] Sir William Herschel was the first to note these polar changes.\r\n\r\n[19] Quite recently, however, Professor Lowell has announced that his\r\nobserver, Mr. E.C. Slipher, finds with the spectroscope faint traces of\r\nwater vapour in the Martian atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[20] In a somewhat similar manner the term \"crater,\" as applied to the\r\nring-mountain formation on the moon, has evidently given a bias in\r\nfavour of the volcanic theory as an explanation of that peculiar\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n[21] Mr. Slipher's results (see note 2, page 213) were not then known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERIOR PLANETS--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planets, so far, have been divided into inferior and superior. Such\r\na division, however, refers merely to the situation of their orbits with\r\nregard to that of our earth. There is, indeed, another manner in which\r\nthey are often classed, namely, according to size. On this principle\r\nthey are divided into two groups; one group called the _Terrestrial\r\nPlanets_, or those which have characteristics like our earth, and the\r\nother called the _Major Planets_, because they are all of very great\r\nsize. The terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, the earth, and Mars.\r\nThe major planets are the remainder, namely, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,\r\nand Neptune. As the earth's orbit is the boundary which separates the\r\ninferior from the superior planets, so does the asteroidal belt divide\r\nthe terrestrial from the major planets. We found the division into\r\ninferior and superior useful for emphasising the marked difference in\r\naspect which those two classes present as seen from our earth; the\r\ninferior planets showing phases like the moon when viewed in the\r\ntelescope, whereas the superior planets do not. But the division into\r\nterrestrial and major planets is the more far-reaching classification of\r\nthe two, for it includes the whole number of planets, whereas the other\r\narrangement necessarily excludes the earth. The members of each of\r\nthese classes have many definite characteristics in common. The\r\nterrestrial planets are all of them relatively small in size,\r\ncomparatively near together, and have few or no satellites. They are,\r\nmoreover, rather dense in structure. The major planets, on the other\r\nhand, are huge bodies, circulating at great distances from each other,\r\nand are, as a rule, provided with a number of satellites. With respect\r\nto structure, they may be fairly described as being loosely put\r\ntogether. Further, the markings on the surfaces of the terrestrial\r\nplanets are permanent, whereas those on the major planets are\r\ncontinually shifting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANET JUPITER\r\n\r\nJupiter is the greatest of the major planets. It has been justly called\r\nthe \"Giant\" planet, for both in volume and in mass it exceeds all the\r\nother planets put together. When seen through the telescope it exhibits\r\na surface plentifully covered with markings, the most remarkable being a\r\nseries of broad parallel belts. The chief belt lies in the central parts\r\nof the planet, and is at present about 10,000 miles wide. It is bounded\r\non either side by a reddish brown belt of about the same width. Bright\r\nspots also appear upon the surface of the planet, last for a while, and\r\nthen disappear. The most notable of the latter is one known as the\r\n\"Great Red Spot.\" This is situated a little beneath the southern red\r\nbelt, and appeared for the first time about thirty years ago. It has\r\nundergone a good many changes in colour and brightness, and is still\r\nfaintly visible. This spot is the most permanent marking which has yet\r\nbeen seen upon Jupiter. In general, the markings change so often that\r\nthe surface which we see is evidently not solid, but of a fleeting\r\nnature akin to cloud (see Plate XIV., p. 230).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV. THE PLANET JUPITER\r\n\r\nThe Giant Planet as seen at 11.30 p.m., on the 11th of January, 1908,\r\nwith a 12-1/2-inch reflecting telescope. The extensive oval marking in\r\nthe upper portion of the disc is the \"Great Red Spot.\" The South is at\r\nthe top of the picture, the view being the _inverted_ one given by an\r\nastronomical telescope. From a drawing by the Rev. Theodore E.R.\r\nPhillips, M.A., F.R.A.S., Director of the Jupiter Section of the British\r\nAstronomical Association.\r\n\r\n(Page 231)]\r\n\r\nObservations of Jupiter's markings show that on an average the planet\r\nrotates on its axis in a period of about 9 hours 54 minutes. The mention\r\nhere of _an average_ with reference to the rotation will, no doubt,\r\nrecall to the reader's mind the similar case of the sun, the different\r\nportions of which rotate with different velocities. The parts of Jupiter\r\nwhich move quickest take 9 hours 50 minutes to go round, while those\r\nwhich move slowest take 9 hours 57 minutes. The middle portions rotate\r\nthe fastest, a phenomenon which the reader will recollect was also the\r\ncase with regard to the sun.\r\n\r\nJupiter is a very loosely packed body. Its density is on an average only\r\nabout 1-1/2 times that of water, or about one-fourth the density of the\r\nearth; but its bulk is so great that the gravitation at that surface\r\nwhich we see is about 2-1/2 times what it is on the surface of the\r\nearth. In accordance, therefore, with the kinetic theory, we may expect\r\nthe planet to retain an extensive layer of gases around it; and this is\r\nconfirmed by the spectroscope, which gives evidence of the presence of a\r\ndense atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, it may be safely inferred that the interior of\r\nJupiter is very hot, and that what we call its surface is not the actual\r\nbody of the planet, but a voluminous layer of clouds and vapours driven\r\nupwards from the heated mass underneath. The planet was indeed formerly\r\nthought to be self-luminous; but this can hardly be the case, for those\r\nportions of the surface which happen to lie at any moment in the\r\nshadows cast by the satellites appear to be quite black. Again, when a\r\nsatellite passes into the great shadow cast by the planet it becomes\r\nentirely invisible, which would not be the case did the planet emit any\r\nperceptible light of its own.\r\n\r\nIn its revolutions around the sun, Jupiter is attended, so far as we\r\nknow, by seven[22] satellites. Four of these were among the first\r\ncelestial objects which Galileo discovered with his \"optick tube,\" and\r\nhe named them the \"Medicean Stars\" in honour of his patron, Cosmo de\r\nMedici. Being comparatively large bodies they might indeed just be seen\r\nwith the naked eye, were it not for the overpowering glare of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nIt was only in quite recent times, namely, in 1892, that a fifth\r\nsatellite was added to the system of Jupiter. This body, discovered by\r\nProfessor E.E. Barnard, is very small. It circulates nearer to the\r\nplanet than the innermost of Galileo's moons; and, on account of the\r\nglare, is a most difficult object to obtain a glimpse of, even in the\r\nbest of telescopes. In December 1904 and January 1905 respectively, two\r\nmore moons were added to the system, these being found by _photography_,\r\nby the American astronomer, Professor C.D. Perrine. Both the bodies in\r\nquestion revolve at a greater distance from the planet than the\r\noutermost of the older known satellites.\r\n\r\nGalileo's moons, though the largest bodies of Jupiter's satellite\r\nsystem, are, as we have already pointed out, very small indeed when\r\ncompared with the planet itself. The diameters of two of them, Europa\r\nand Io, are, however, about the same as that of our moon, while those of\r\nthe other two, Callisto and Ganymede, are more than half as large again.\r\nThe recently discovered satellites are, on the other hand,\r\ninsignificant; that found by Barnard, for example, being only about 100\r\nmiles in diameter.\r\n\r\nOf the four original satellites Io is the nearest to Jupiter, and, seen\r\nfrom the planet, it would show a disc somewhat larger than that of our\r\nmoon. The others would appear somewhat smaller. However, on account of\r\nthe great distance of the sun, the entire light reflected to Jupiter by\r\nall the satellites should be very much less than what we get from our\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nBarnard's satellite circles around Jupiter at a distance less than our\r\nmoon is from us, and in a period of about 12 hours. Galileo's four\r\nsatellites revolve in periods of about 2, 3-1/2, 7, and 16-1/2 days\r\nrespectively, at distances lying roughly between a quarter of a million\r\nand one million miles. Perrine's two satellites are at a distance of\r\nabout seven million miles, and take about nine months to complete their\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\nThe larger satellites, when viewed in the telescope, exhibit certain\r\ndefined markings; but the bodies are so far away from us, that only\r\nthose details which are of great extent can be seen. The satellite Io,\r\naccording to Professor Barnard, shows a darkish disc, with a broad white\r\nbelt across its middle regions. Mr. Douglass, one of the observers at\r\nthe Lowell Observatory, has noted upon Ganymede a number of markings\r\nsomewhat resembling those seen on Mars, and he concludes, from their\r\nmovement, that this satellite rotates on its axis in about seven days.\r\nProfessor Barnard, on the other hand, does not corroborate this, though\r\nhe claims to have discovered bright polar caps on both Ganymede and\r\nCallisto.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter we dealt at length with eclipses, occultations,\r\nand transits, and endeavoured to make clear the distinction between\r\nthem. The system of Jupiter's satellites furnishes excellent examples of\r\nall these phenomena. The planet casts a very extensive shadow, and the\r\nsatellites are constantly undergoing obscuration by passing through it.\r\nSuch occurrences are plainly comparable to our lunar eclipses. Again,\r\nthe satellites may, at one time, be occulted by the huge disc of the\r\nplanet, and at another time seen in transit over its face. A fourth\r\nphenomenon is what is known as an _eclipse of the planet by a\r\nsatellite_, which is the exact equivalent of what we style on the earth\r\nan eclipse of the sun. In this last case the shadow, cast by the\r\nsatellite, appears as a round black spot in movement across the planet's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIn the passages of these attendant bodies behind the planet, into its\r\nshadow, or across its face, respectively, it occasionally happens that\r\nGalileo's four satellites all disappear from view, and the planet is\r\nthen seen for a while in the unusual condition of being apparently\r\nwithout its customary attendants. An instance of this phenomenon took\r\nplace on the 3rd of October 1907. On that occasion, the satellites known\r\nas I. and III. (_i.e._ Io and Ganymede) were eclipsed, that is to say,\r\nobscured by passing into the planet's shadow; Satellite IV. (Callisto)\r\nwas occulted by the planet's disc; while Satellite II. (Europa), being\r\nat the same moment in transit across the planet's face, was invisible\r\nagainst that brilliant background. A number of instances of this kind of\r\noccurrence are on record. Galileo, for example, noted one on the 15th of\r\nMarch 1611, while Herschel observed another on the 23rd of May 1802.\r\n\r\nIt was indirectly to Jupiter's satellites that the world was first\r\nindebted for its knowledge of the velocity of light. When the periods of\r\nrevolution of the satellites were originally determined, Jupiter\r\nhappened, at the time, to be at his nearest to us. From the periods thus\r\nfound tables were made for the prediction of the moments at which the\r\neclipses and other phenomena of the satellites should take place. As\r\nJupiter, in the course of his orbit, drew further away from the earth,\r\nit was noticed that the disappearances of the satellites into the shadow\r\nof the planet occurred regularly later than the time predicted. In the\r\nyear 1675, Roemer, a Danish astronomer, inferred from this, not that the\r\npredictions were faulty, but that light did not travel instantaneously.\r\nIt appeared, in fact, to take longer to reach us, the greater the\r\ndistance it had to traverse. Thus, when the planet was far from the\r\nearth, the last ray given out by the satellite, before its passage into\r\nthe shadow, took a longer time to cross the intervening space, than when\r\nthe planet was near. Modern experiments in physics have quite confirmed\r\nthis, and have proved for us that light does not travel across space in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye, as might hastily be supposed, but actually\r\nmoves, as has been already stated, at the rate of about 186,000 miles\r\nper second.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANET SATURN\r\n\r\nSeen in the telescope the planet Saturn is a wonderful and very\r\nbeautiful object. It is distinguished from all the other planets, in\r\nfact from all known celestial bodies, through being girt around its\r\nequator by what looks like a broad, flat ring of exceeding thinness.\r\nThis, however, upon closer examination, is found to be actually composed\r\nof three concentric rings. The outermost of these is nearly of the same\r\nbrightness as the body of the planet itself. The ring which comes\r\nimmediately within it is also bright, and is separated from the outer\r\none all the way round by a relatively narrow space, known as \"Cassini's\r\ndivision,\" because it was discovered by the celebrated French\r\nastronomer, J.D. Cassini, in the year 1675. Inside the second ring, and\r\nmerging insensibly into it, is a third one, known as the \"crape ring,\"\r\nbecause it is darker in hue than the others and partly transparent, the\r\nbody of Saturn being visible through it. The inner boundary of this\r\nthird and last ring does not adjoin the planet, but is everywhere\r\nseparated from it by a definite space. This ring was discovered\r\n_independently_[23] in 1850 by Bond in America and Dawes in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV. THE PLANET SATURN\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing made by Professor Barnard with the Great Lick Telescope.\r\nThe black band fringing the outer ring, where it crosses the disc, is\r\nportion of the _shadow which the rings cast upon the planet_. The black\r\nwedge-shaped mark, where the rings disappear behind the disc at the\r\nleft-hand side, is portion of the _shadow which the planet casts upon\r\nthe rings_.\r\n\r\n(Page 237)]\r\n\r\nAs distinguished from the crape ring, the bright rings must have a\r\nconsiderable closeness of texture; for the shadow of the planet may be\r\nseen projected upon them, and their shadows in turn projected upon the\r\nsurface of the planet (see Plate XV., p. 236).\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Barnard, the entire breadth of the ring system,\r\nthat is to say, from one side to the other of the outer ring, is 172,310\r\nmiles, or somewhat more than double the planet's diameter.\r\n\r\nIn the varying views which we get of Saturn, the system of the rings is\r\npresented to us at very different angles. Sometimes we are enabled to\r\ngaze upon its broad expanse; at other times, however, its thin edge is\r\nturned exactly towards us, an occurrence which takes place after\r\nintervals of about fifteen years. When this happened in 1892 the rings\r\nare said to have disappeared entirely from view in the great Lick\r\ntelescope. We thus get an idea of their small degree of thickness, which\r\nwould appear to be only about 50 miles. The last time the system of\r\nrings was exactly edgewise to the earth was on the 3rd of October 1907.\r\n\r\nThe question of the composition of these rings has given rise to a good\r\ndeal of speculation. It was formerly supposed that they were either\r\nsolid or liquid, but in 1857 it was proved by Clerk Maxwell that a\r\nstructure of this kind would not be able to stand. He showed, however,\r\nthat they could be fully explained by supposing them to consist of an\r\nimmense number of separate solid particles, or, as one might otherwise\r\nput it, extremely small satellites, circling in dense swarms around the\r\nmiddle portions of the planet. It is therefore believed that we have\r\nhere the materials ready for the formation of a satellite or satellites;\r\nbut that the powerful gravitative action, arising through the planet's\r\nbeing so near at hand, is too great ever to allow these materials to\r\naggregate themselves into a solid mass. There is, as a matter of fact, a\r\nminimum distance from the body of any planet within which it can be\r\nshown that a satellite will be unable to form on account of\r\ngravitational stress. This is known as \"Roche's limit,\" from the name of\r\na French astronomer who specially investigated the question.\r\n\r\nThere thus appears to be a certain degree of analogy between Saturn's\r\nrings and the asteroids. Empty spaces, too, exist in the asteroidal\r\nzone, the relative position of one of which bears a striking resemblance\r\nto that of \"Cassini's division.\" It is suggested, indeed, that this\r\ndivision had its origin in gravitational disturbances produced by the\r\nattraction of the larger satellites, just as the empty spaces in the\r\nasteroidal zone are supposed to be the result of perturbations caused by\r\nthe Giant Planet hard by.\r\n\r\nIt has long been understood that the system of the rings must be\r\nrotating around Saturn, for if they were not in motion his intense\r\ngravitational attraction would quickly tear them in pieces. This was at\r\nlength proved to be the fact by the late Professor Keeler, Director of\r\nthe Lick Observatory, who from spectroscopic observations found that\r\nthose portions of the rings situated near to the planet rotated faster\r\nthan those farther from it. This directly supports the view that the\r\nrings are composed of satellites; for, as we have already seen, the\r\nnearer a satellite is to its primary the faster it will revolve. On the\r\nother hand, were the rings solid, their outer portions would move the\r\nfastest; as we have seen takes place in the body of the earth, for\r\nexample. The mass of the ring system, however, must be exceedingly\r\nsmall, for it does not appear to produce any disturbances in the\r\nmovements of Saturn's satellites. From the kinetic theory, therefore,\r\none would not expect to find any atmosphere on the rings, and the\r\nabsence of it is duly shown by spectroscopic observations.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of Saturn, roughly speaking, is about one-fifth less than\r\nthat of Jupiter. The planet is very flattened at the poles, this\r\nflattening being quite noticeable in a good telescope. For instance, the\r\ndiameter across the equator is about 76,470 miles, while from pole to\r\npole it is much less, namely, 69,770.\r\n\r\nThe surface of Saturn bears a strong resemblance to that of Jupiter. Its\r\nmarkings, though not so well defined, are of the same belt-like\r\ndescription; and from observation of them it appears that the planet\r\nrotates _on an average_ in a little over ten hours. The rotation is in\r\nfact of the same peculiar kind as that of the sun and Jupiter; but the\r\ndifference of speed at which the various portions of Saturn go round are\r\neven more marked than in the case of the Giant Planet. The density of\r\nSaturn is less than that of Jupiter; so that it must be largely in a\r\ncondition of vapour, and in all probability at a still earlier stage of\r\nplanetary evolution.\r\n\r\nUp to the present we know of as many as ten satellites circling around\r\nSaturn, which is more than any other planet of the solar system can lay\r\nclaim to. Two of these, however, are very recent discoveries; one,\r\nPhoebe, having been found by photography in August 1898, and the other,\r\nThemis, in 1904, also by the same means. For both of these we are\r\nindebted to Professor W.H. Pickering. Themis is said to be _the faintest\r\nobject in the solar system_. It cannot be _seen_, even with the largest\r\ntelescope in existence; a fact which should hardly fail to impress upon\r\none the great advantage the photographic plate possesses in these\r\nresearches over the human eye.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the whole Saturnian family of satellites are the\r\ntwo known as Titan and Japetus. These were discovered respectively by\r\nHuyghens in 1655 and by Cassini in 1671. Japetus is about the same size\r\nas our moon; while the diameter of Titan, the largest of the satellites,\r\nis about half as much again. Titan takes about sixteen days to revolve\r\naround Saturn, while Japetus takes more than two months and a half. The\r\nformer is about three-quarters of a million miles distant from the\r\nplanet, and the latter about two and a quarter millions. To Sir William\r\nHerschel we are indebted for the discovery of two more satellites, one\r\nof which he found on the evening that he used his celebrated 40-foot\r\ntelescope for the first time. The ninth satellite, Phoebe, one of the\r\ntwo discovered by Professor Pickering, is perhaps the most remarkable\r\nbody in the solar system, for all the other known members of that system\r\nperform their revolutions in one fixed direction, whereas this satellite\r\nrevolves in the _contrary_ direction.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the great distance of Saturn, the sun, as seen from\r\nthe planet, would appear so small that it would scarcely show any disc.\r\nThe planet, indeed, only receives from the sun about one-ninetieth of\r\nthe heat and light which the earth receives. Owing to this diminished\r\nintensity of illumination, the combined light reflected to Saturn by the\r\nwhole of its satellites must be very small.\r\n\r\nWith the sole exception of Jupiter, not one of the planets circulating\r\nnearer to the sun could be seen from Saturn, as they would be entirely\r\nlost in the solar glare. For an observer upon Saturn, Jupiter would,\r\ntherefore, fill much the same position as Venus does for us, regularly\r\ndisplaying phases and being alternately a morning and an evening star.\r\n\r\nIt is rather interesting to consider the appearances which would be\r\nproduced in our skies were the earth embellished with a system of rings\r\nsimilar to those of Saturn. In consequence of the curving of the\r\nterrestrial surface, they would not be seen at all from within the\r\nArctic or Antarctic circles, as they would be always below the horizon.\r\nFrom the equator they would be continually seen edgewise, and so would\r\nappear merely as line of light stretching right across the heaven and\r\npassing through the zenith. But the dwellers in the remaining regions\r\nwould find them very objectionable, for they would cut off the light of\r\nthe sun during lengthy periods of time.\r\n\r\nSaturn was a sore puzzle to the early telescopic observers. They did not\r\nfor a long time grasp the fact that it was surrounded by a ring--so slow\r\nis the human mind to seek for explanations out of the ordinary course of\r\nthings. The protrusions of the ring on either side of the planet, at\r\nfirst looked to Galileo like two minor globes placed on opposite sides\r\nof it, and slightly overlapping the disc. He therefore informed Kepler\r\nthat \"Saturn consists of three stars in contact with one another.\" Yet\r\nhe was genuinely puzzled by the fact that the two attendant bodies (as\r\nhe thought them) always retained the same position with regard to the\r\nplanet's disc, and did not appear to revolve around it, nor to be in any\r\nwise shifted as a consequence of the movements of our earth.\r\n\r\nAbout a year and a half elapsed before he again examined Saturn; and, if\r\nhe was previously puzzled, he was now thoroughly amazed. It happened\r\njust then to be one of those periods when the ring is edgewise towards\r\nthe earth, and of course he only saw a round disc like that of Jupiter.\r\nWhat, indeed, had become of the attendant orbs? Was some demon mocking\r\nhim? Had Saturn devoured his own children? He was, however, fated to be\r\nstill more puzzled, for soon the minor orbs reappeared, and, becoming\r\nlarger and larger as time went on, they ended by losing their globular\r\nappearance and became like two pairs of arms clasping the planet from\r\neach side! (see Plate XVI., p. 242).\r\n\r\nGalileo went to his grave with the riddle still unsolved, and it\r\nremained for the famous Dutch astronomer, Huyghens, to clear up the\r\nmatter. It was, however, some little time before he hit upon the real\r\nexplanation. Having noticed that there were dark spaces between the\r\nstrange appendages and the body of the planet, he imagined Saturn to be\r\na globe fitted with handles at each side; \"ansæ\" these came to be\r\ncalled, from the Latin _ansa_, which means a handle. At length, in the\r\nyear 1656, he solved the problem, and this he did by means of that\r\n123-foot tubeless telescope, of which mention has already been made. The\r\nring happened then to be at its edgewise period, and a careful study of\r\nthe behaviour of the ansæ when disappearing and reappearing soon\r\nrevealed to Huyghens the true explanation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI. EARLY REPRESENTATIONS OF SATURN\r\n\r\nFrom an illustration in the _Systema Saturnium_ of Christian Huyghens.\r\n\r\n(Page 242)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS URANUS AND NEPTUNE\r\n\r\nWe have already explained (in Chapter II.) the circumstances in which\r\nboth Uranus and Neptune were discovered. It should, however, be added\r\nthat after the discovery of Uranus, that planet was found to have been\r\nalready noted upon several occasions by different observers, but always\r\nwithout the least suspicion that it was other than a mere faint star.\r\nAgain, with reference to the discovery of Neptune, it may here be\r\nmentioned that the apparent amount by which that planet had pulled\r\nUranus out of its place upon the starry background was exceedingly\r\nsmall--so small, indeed, that no eye could have detected it without the\r\naid of a telescope!\r\n\r\nOf the two predictions of the place of Neptune in the sky, that of Le\r\nVerrier was the nearer. Indeed, the position calculated by Adams was\r\nmore than twice as far out. But Adams was by a long way the first in the\r\nfield with his results, and only for unfortunate delays the prize would\r\ncertainly have fallen to him. For instance, there was no star-map at\r\nCambridge, and Professor Challis, the director of the observatory there,\r\nwas in consequence obliged to make a laborious examination of the stars\r\nin the suspected region. On the other hand, all that Galle had to do was\r\nto compare that part of the sky where Le Verrier told him to look with\r\nthe Berlin star-chart which he had by him. This he did on September 23,\r\n1846, with the result that he quickly noted an eighth magnitude star\r\nwhich did not figure in that chart. By the next night this star had\r\naltered its position in the sky, thus disclosing the fact that it was\r\nreally a planet.\r\n\r\nSix days later Professor Challis succeeded in finding the planet, but of\r\ncourse he was now too late. On reviewing his labours he ascertained that\r\nhe had actually noted down its place early in August, and had he only\r\nbeen able to sift his observations as he made them, the discovery would\r\nhave been made then.\r\n\r\nLater on it was found that Neptune had only just missed being discovered\r\nabout fifty years earlier. In certain observations made during 1795, the\r\nfamous French astronomer, Lalande, found that a star, which he had\r\nmapped in a certain position on the 8th of May of that year, was in a\r\ndifferent position two days later. The idea of a planet does not appear\r\nto have entered his mind, and he merely treated the first observation as\r\nan error!\r\n\r\nThe reader will, no doubt, recollect how the discovery of the asteroids\r\nwas due in effect to an apparent break in the seemingly regular sequence\r\nof the planetary orbits outwards from the sun. This curious sequence of\r\nrelative distances is usually known as \"Bode's Law,\" because it was\r\nfirst brought into general notice by an astronomer of that name. It had,\r\nhowever, previously been investigated mathematically by Titius in 1772.\r\nLong before this, indeed, the unnecessarily wide space between the\r\norbits of Mars and Jupiter had attracted the attention of the great\r\nKepler to such a degree, that he predicted that a planet would some day\r\nbe found to fill the void. Notwithstanding the service which the\r\nso-called Law of Bode has indirectly rendered to astronomy, it has\r\nstrangely enough been found after all not to rest upon any scientific\r\nfoundation. It will not account for the distance from the sun of the\r\norbit of Neptune, and the very sequence seems on the whole to be in the\r\nnature of a mere coincidence.\r\n\r\nNeptune is invisible to the naked eye; Uranus is just at the limit of\r\nvisibility. Both planets are, however, so far from us that we can get\r\nbut the poorest knowledge of their condition and surroundings. Uranus,\r\nup to the present, is known to be attended by four satellites, and\r\nNeptune by one. The planets themselves are about equal in size; their\r\ndiameters, roughly speaking, being about one-half that of Saturn. Some\r\nmarkings have, indeed, been seen upon the disc of Uranus, but they are\r\nvery indistinct and fleeting. From observation of them, it is assumed\r\nthat the planet rotates on its axis in a period of some ten to twelve\r\nhours. No definite markings have as yet been seen upon Neptune, which\r\nbody is described by several observers as resembling a faint planetary\r\nnebula.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their physical condition, the most that can be said about\r\nthese two planets is that they are probably in much the same vaporous\r\nstate as Jupiter and Saturn. On account of their great distance from the\r\nsun they can receive but little solar heat and light. Seen from\r\nNeptune, in fact, the sun would appear only about the size of Venus at\r\nher best, though of a brightness sufficiently intense to illumine the\r\nNeptunian landscape with about seven hundred times our full moonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n[22] Mr. P. Melotte, of Greenwich Observatory, while examining a\r\nphotograph taken there on February 28, 1908, discovered upon it a very\r\nfaint object which it is firmly believed will prove to be an _eighth_\r\nsatellite of Jupiter. This object was afterwards found on plates exposed\r\nas far back as January 27. It has since been photographed several times\r\nat Greenwich, and also at Heidelberg (by Dr. Max Wolf) and at the Lick\r\nObservatory. Its movement is probably _retrograde_, like that of Phoebe\r\n(p. 240).\r\n\r\n[23] In the history of astronomy two salient points stand out.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the number of \"independent\" discoveries which have\r\ntaken place; such, for instance, as in the cases of Le Verrier and Adams\r\nwith regard to Neptune, and of Lockyer and Janssen in the matter of the\r\nspectroscopic method of observing solar prominences.\r\n\r\nThe other is the great amount of \"anticipation.\" Copernicus, as we have\r\nseen, was anticipated by the Greeks; Kepler was not actually the first\r\nwho thought of elliptic orbits; others before Newton had imagined an\r\nattractive force.\r\n\r\nBoth these points furnish much food for thought!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCOMETS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader has, no doubt, been struck by the marked uniformity which\r\nexists among those members of the solar system with which we have dealt\r\nup to the present. The sun, the planets, and their satellites are all\r\nwhat we call solid bodies. The planets move around the sun, and the\r\nsatellites around the planets, in orbits which, though strictly\r\nspeaking, ellipses, are yet not in any instance of a very oval form. Two\r\nresults naturally follow from these considerations. Firstly, the bodies\r\nin question hide the light coming to us from those further off, when\r\nthey pass in front of them. Secondly, the planets never get so far from\r\nthe sun that we lose sight of them altogether.\r\n\r\nWith the objects known as Comets it is, however, quite the contrary.\r\nThese objects do not conform to our notions of solidity. They are so\r\ntransparent that they can pass across the smallest star without dimming\r\nits light in the slightest degree. Again, they are only visible to us\r\nduring a portion of their orbits. A comet may be briefly described as an\r\nilluminated filmy-looking object, made up usually of three portions--a\r\nhead, a nucleus, or brighter central portion within this head, and a\r\ntail. The heads of comets vary greatly in size; some, indeed, appear\r\nquite small, like stars, while others look even as large as the moon.\r\nOccasionally the nucleus is wanting, and sometimes the tail also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Showing how the Tail of a Comet is directed\r\naway from the Sun.]\r\n\r\nThese mysterious visitors to our skies come up into view out of the\r\nimmensities beyond, move towards the sun at a rapidly increasing speed,\r\nand, having gone around it, dash away again into the depths of space. As\r\na comet approaches the sun, its body appears to grow smaller and\r\nsmaller, while, at the same time, it gradually throws out behind it an\r\nappendage like a tail. As the comet moves round the central orb this\r\ntail is always directed _away_ from the sun; and when it departs again\r\ninto space the tail goes in advance. As the comet's distance from the\r\nsun increases, the tail gradually shrinks away and the head once more\r\ngrows in size (see Fig. 18). In consequence of these changes, and of the\r\nfact that we lose sight of comets comparatively quickly, one is much\r\ninclined to wonder what further changes may take place after the bodies\r\nhave passed beyond our ken.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of comets are, as we have seen, very elliptic. In some\r\ninstances this ellipticity is so great as to take the bodies out into\r\nspace to nearly six times the distance of Neptune from the sun. For a\r\nlong time, indeed, it was considered that comets were of two kinds,\r\nnamely, those which actually _belonged_ to the solar system, and those\r\nwhich were merely _visitors_ to it for the first and only time--rushing\r\nin from the depths of space, rapidly circuiting the sun, and finally\r\ndashing away into space again, never to return. On the contrary,\r\nnowadays, astronomers are generally inclined to regard comets as\r\npermanent members of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty, however, of deciding absolutely whether the orbits of\r\ncomets are really always _closed_ curves, that is to say, curves which\r\nmust sooner or later bring the bodies back again towards the sun, is,\r\nindeed, very great. Comets, in the first place, are always so diffuse,\r\nthat it is impossible to determine their exact position, or, rather, the\r\nexact position of that important point within them, known as the centre\r\nof gravity. Secondly, that stretch of its orbit along which we can\r\nfollow a comet, is such a very small portion of the whole path, that the\r\nslightest errors of observation which we make will result in\r\nconsiderably altering our estimate of the actual shape of the orbit.\r\n\r\nComets have been described as so transparent that they can pass across\r\nthe sky without dimming the lustre of the smallest stars, which the\r\nthinnest fog or mist would do. This is, indeed, true of every portion\r\nof a comet except the nucleus, which is, as its name implies, the\r\ndensest part. And yet, in contrast to this ghostlike character, is the\r\nstrange fact that when comets are of a certain brightness they may\r\nactually be seen in full daylight.\r\n\r\nAs might be gathered from their extreme tenuity, comets are so\r\nexceedingly small in mass that they do not appear to exert any\r\ngravitational attraction upon the other bodies of our system. It is,\r\nindeed, a known fact that in the year 1886 a comet passed right amidst\r\nthe satellites of Jupiter without disturbing them in the slightest\r\ndegree. The attraction of the planet, on the other hand, so altered the\r\ncomet's orbit, as to cause it to revolve around the sun in a period of\r\nseven years, instead of twenty-seven, as had previously been the case.\r\nAlso, in 1779, the comet known as Lexell's passed quite close to\r\nJupiter, and its orbit was so changed by that planet's attraction that\r\nit has never been seen since. The density of comets must, as a rule, be\r\nvery much less than the one-thousandth part of that of the air at the\r\nsurface of our globe; for, if the density of the comet were even so\r\nsmall as this, its mass would _not_ be inappreciable.\r\n\r\nIf comets are really undoubted members of the solar system, the\r\ncircumstances in which they were evolved must have been different from\r\nthose which produced the planets and satellites. The axial rotations of\r\nboth the latter, and also their revolutions, take place in one certain\r\ndirection;[24] their orbits, too, are ellipses which do not differ much\r\nfrom circles, and which, furthermore, are situated fairly in the one\r\nplane. Comets, on the other hand, do not necessarily travel round the\r\nsun in the same fixed direction as the planets. Their orbits, besides,\r\nare exceedingly elliptic; and, far from keeping to one plane, or even\r\nnear it, they approach the sun from all directions.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, comets may be divided into two distinct classes, or\r\n\"families.\" In the first class, the same orbit appears to be shared in\r\ncommon by a series of comets which travel along it, one following the\r\nother. The comets which appeared in the years 1668, 1843, 1880, 1882,\r\nand 1887 are instances of a number of different bodies pursuing the same\r\npath around the sun. The members of a comet family of this kind are\r\nobserved to have similar characteristics. The idea is that such comets\r\nare merely portions of one much larger cometary body, which became\r\nbroken up by the gravitational action of other bodies in the system, or\r\nthrough violent encounter with the sun's surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe second class is composed of comets which are supposed to have been\r\nseized by the gravitative action of certain planets, and thus forced to\r\nrevolve in short ellipses around the sun, well within the limits of the\r\nsolar system. These comets are, in consequence, spoken of as \"captures.\"\r\nThey move around the sun in the same direction as the planets do.\r\nJupiter has a fairly large comet family of this kind attached to him. As\r\na result of his overpowering gravitation, it is imagined that during the\r\nages he must have attracted a large number of these bodies on his own\r\naccount, and, perhaps, have robbed other planets of their captures. His\r\nfamily at present numbers about thirty. Of the other planets, so far as\r\nwe know, Saturn possesses a comet family of two, Uranus three, and\r\nNeptune six. There are, indeed, a few comets which appear as if under\r\nthe influence of some force situated outside the known bounds of the\r\nsolar system, a circumstance which goes to strengthen the idea that\r\nother planets may revolve beyond the orbit of Neptune. The terrestrial\r\nplanets, on the other hand, cannot have comet families; because the\r\nenormous gravitative action of the sun in their vicinity entirely\r\noverpowers the attractive force which they exert upon those comets which\r\npass close to them. Besides this, a comet, when in the inner regions of\r\nthe solar system, moves with such rapidity, that the gravitational pull\r\nof the planets there situated is not powerful enough to deflect it to\r\nany extent. It must not be presumed, however, that a comet once captured\r\nshould always remain a prisoner. Further disturbing causes might\r\nunsettle its newly acquired orbit, and send it out again into the\r\ncelestial spaces.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the matter of which comets are composed, the spectroscope\r\nshows the presence in them of hydrocarbon compounds (a notable\r\ncharacteristic of these bodies), and at times, also, of sodium and iron.\r\nSome of the light which we get from comets is, however, merely reflected\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the tails of comets are always directed away from the sun,\r\nhas given rise to the idea that this is caused by some repelling action\r\nemanating from the sun itself, which is continually driving off the\r\nsmallest particles. Two leading theories have been formulated to account\r\nfor the tails themselves upon the above assumption. One of these, first\r\nsuggested by Olbers in 1812, and now associated with the name of the\r\nRussian astronomer, the late Professor Brédikhine, who carefully worked\r\nit out, presumes an electrical action emanating from the sun; the other,\r\nthat of Arrhenius, supposes a pressure exerted by the solar light in its\r\nradiation outwards into space. It is possible, indeed, that repelling\r\nforces of both these kinds may be at work together. Minute particles are\r\nprobably being continually produced by friction and collisions among the\r\nmore solid parts in the heads of comets. Supposing that such particles\r\nare driven off altogether, one may therefore assume that the so-called\r\ncaptured comets are disintegrating at a comparatively rapid rate. Kepler\r\nlong ago maintained that \"comets die,\" and this actually appears to be\r\nthe case. The ordinary periodic ones, such, for instance, as Encke's\r\nComet, are very faint, and becoming fainter at each return. Certain of\r\nthese comets have, indeed, failed altogether to reappear. It is notable\r\nthat the members of Jupiter's comet family are not very conspicuous\r\nobjects. They have small tails, and even in some cases have none at all.\r\nThe family, too, does not contain many members, and yet one cannot but\r\nsuppose that Jupiter, on account of his great mass, has had many\r\nopportunities for making captures adown the ages.\r\n\r\nOf the two theories to which allusion has above been made, that of\r\nBrédikhine has been worked out so carefully, and with such a show of\r\nplausibility, that it here calls for a detailed description. It appears\r\nbesides to explain the phenomena of comets' tails so much more\r\nsatisfactorily than that of Arrhenius, that astronomers are inclined to\r\naccept it the more readily of the two. According to Brédikhine's theory\r\nthe electrical repulsive force, which he assumes for the purposes of his\r\nargument, will drive the minutest particles of the comet in a direction\r\naway from the sun much more readily than the gravitative action of that\r\nbody will pull them towards it. This may be compared to the ease with\r\nwhich fine dust may be blown upwards, although the earth's gravitation\r\nis acting upon it all the time.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Brédikhine, which began seriously with his\r\ninvestigation of Coggia's Comet of 1874, led him to classify the tails\r\nof comets in _three types_. Presuming that the repulsive force emanating\r\nfrom the sun did not vary, he came to the conclusion that the different\r\nforms assumed by cometary tails must be ascribed to the special action\r\nof this force upon the various elements which happen to be present in\r\nthe comet. The tails which he classes as of the first type, are those\r\nwhich are long and straight and point directly away from the sun.\r\nExamples of such tails are found in the comets of 1811, 1843, and 1861.\r\nTails of this kind, he thinks, are in all probability formed of\r\n_hydrogen_. His second type comprises those which are pointed away from\r\nthe sun, but at the same time are considerably curved, as was seen in\r\nthe comets of Donati and Coggia. These tails are formed of _hydrocarbon\r\ngas_. The third type of tail is short, brush-like, and strongly bent,\r\nand is formed of the _vapour of iron_, mixed with that of sodium and\r\nother elements. It should, however, be noted that comets have\r\noccasionally been seen which possess several tails of these various\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nWe will now touch upon a few of the best known comets of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1680 was the first whose orbit was calculated according to\r\nthe laws of gravitation. This was accomplished by Newton, and he found\r\nthat the comet in question completed its journey round the sun in a\r\nperiod of about 600 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1682 there appeared a great comet, which has become famous under the\r\nname of Halley's Comet, in consequence of the profound investigations\r\nmade into its motion by the great astronomer, Edmund Halley. He fixed\r\nits period of revolution around the sun at about seventy-five years, and\r\npredicted that it would reappear in the early part of 1759. He did not,\r\nhowever, live to see this fulfilled, but the comet duly returned--_the\r\nfirst body of the kind to verify such a prediction_--and was detected on\r\nChristmas Day, 1758, by George Palitzch, an amateur observer living near\r\nDresden. Halley also investigated the past history of the comet, and\r\ntraced it back to the year 1456. The orbit of Halley's comet passes out\r\nslightly beyond the orbit of Neptune. At its last visit in 1835, this\r\ncomet passed comparatively close to us, namely, within five million\r\nmiles of the earth. According to the calculations of Messrs P.H. Cowell\r\nand A.C.D. Crommelin of Greenwich Observatory, its next return will be\r\nin the spring of 1910; the nearest approach to the earth taking place\r\nabout May 12.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March, 1811, a great comet appeared, which remained\r\nvisible for nearly a year and a half. It was a magnificent object; the\r\ntail being about 100 millions of miles in length, and the head about\r\n127,000 miles in diameter. A detailed study which he gave to this comet\r\nprompted Olbers to put forward that theory of electrical repulsion\r\nwhich, as we have seen, has since been so carefully worked out by\r\nBrédikhine. Olbers had noticed that the particles expelled from the head\r\nappeared to travel to the end of the tail in about eleven minutes, thus\r\nshowing a velocity per second very similar to that of light.\r\n\r\nThe discovery in 1819 of the comet known as Encke's, because its orbit\r\nwas determined by an astronomer of that name, drew attention for the\r\nfirst time to Jupiter's comet family, and, indeed, to short-period\r\ncomets in general. This comet revolves around the sun in the shortest\r\nknown period of any of these bodies, namely, 3-1/3 years. Encke\r\npredicted that it would return in 1822. This duly occurred, the comet\r\npassing at its nearest to the sun within three hours of the time\r\nindicated; being thus the second instance of the fulfilment of a\r\nprediction of the kind. A certain degree of irregularity which Encke's\r\nComet displays in the dates of its returns to the sun, has been supposed\r\nto indicate that it passes in the course of its orbit through some\r\nretarding medium, but no definite conclusions have so far been arrived\r\nat in this matter.\r\n\r\nA comet, which appeared in 1826, goes by the name of Biela's Comet,\r\nbecause of its discovery by an Austrian military officer, Wilhelm von\r\nBiela. This comet was found to have a period of between six and seven\r\nyears. Certain calculations made by Olbers showed that, at its return in\r\n1832, it would pass _through the earth's orbit_. The announcement of\r\nthis gave rise to a panic; for people did not wait to inquire whether\r\nthe earth would be anywhere near that part of its orbit when the comet\r\npassed. The panic, however, subsided when the French astronomer, Arago,\r\nshowed that at the moment in question the earth would be some 50\r\nmillions of miles away from the point indicated!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII. DONATI'S COMET\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing made on October 9th, 1858, by G.P. Bond, of Harvard\r\nCollege Observatory, U.S.A. A good illustration of Brédikhine's theory:\r\nnote the straight tails of his _first_ type, and the curved tail of his\r\n_second_.\r\n\r\n(Page 257)]\r\n\r\nIn 1846, shortly after one of its returns, Biela's Comet divided into\r\ntwo portions. At its next appearance (1852) these portions had separated\r\nto a distance of about 1-1/2 millions of miles from each other. This\r\ncomet, or rather its constituents, have never since been seen.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable comet of recent times was that of 1858,\r\nknown as Donati's, it having been discovered at Florence by the Italian\r\nastronomer, G.B. Donati. This comet, a magnificent object, was visible\r\nfor more than three months with the naked eye. Its tail was then 54\r\nmillions of miles in length. It was found to revolve around the sun in a\r\nperiod of over 2000 years, and to go out in its journey to about 5-1/2\r\ntimes the distance of Neptune. Its motion is retrograde, that is to say,\r\nin the contrary direction to the usual movement in the solar system. A\r\nnumber of beautiful drawings of Donati's Comet were made by the American\r\nastronomer, G.P. Bond. One of the best of these is reproduced on Plate\r\nXVII., p. 256.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 there appeared a great comet. On the 30th of June of that year\r\nthe earth and moon actually passed through its tail; but no effects were\r\nnoticed, other than a peculiar luminosity in the sky.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1881 there appeared another large comet, known as Tebbutt's\r\nComet, from the name of its discoverer. This was the _first comet of\r\nwhich a satisfactory photograph was obtained_. The photograph in\r\nquestion was taken by the late M. Janssen.\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1882 was of vast size and brilliance. It approached so\r\nclose to the sun that it passed through some 100,000 miles of the solar\r\ncorona. Though its orbit was not found to have been altered by this\r\nexperience, its nucleus displayed signs of breaking up. Some very fine\r\nphotographs of this comet were obtained at the Cape of Good Hope by Mr.\r\n(now Sir David) Gill.\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1889 was followed with the telescope nearly up to the orbit\r\nof Saturn, which seems to be the greatest distance at which a comet has\r\never been seen.\r\n\r\nThe _first discovery of a comet by photographic means_[25] was made by\r\nProfessor Barnard in 1892; and, since then, photography has been\r\nemployed with marked success in the detection of small periodic comets.\r\n\r\nThe best comet seen in the Northern hemisphere since that of 1882,\r\nappears to have been Daniel's Comet of 1907 (see Plate XVIII., p. 258).\r\nThis comet was discovered on June 9, 1907, by Mr. Z. Daniel, at\r\nPrinceton Observatory, New Jersey, U.S.A. It became visible to the naked\r\neye about mid-July of that year, and reached its greatest brilliancy\r\nabout the end of August. It did not, however, attract much popular\r\nattention, as its position in the sky allowed it to be seen only just\r\nbefore dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n[24] With the exception, of course, of such an anomaly as the retrograde\r\nmotion of the ninth satellite of Saturn.\r\n\r\n[25] If we except the case of the comet which was photographed near the\r\nsolar corona in the eclipse of 1882.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII. DANIEL'S COMET OF 1907\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken, on August 11th, 1907, by Dr. Max Wolf, at the\r\nAstrophysical Observatory, Heidelberg. The instrument used was a 28-inch\r\nreflecting telescope, and the time of exposure was fifteen minutes. As\r\nthe telescope was guided to follow the moving comet, the stars have\r\nimprinted themselves upon the photographic plate as short trails. This\r\nis clearly the opposite to what is depicted on Plate XIII.\r\n\r\n(Page 258)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE COMETS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf eclipses were a cause of terror in past ages, comets appear to have\r\nbeen doubly so. Their much longer continuance in the sight of men had no\r\ndoubt something to say to this, and also the fact that they arrived\r\nwithout warning; it not being then possible to give even a rough\r\nprediction of their return, as in the case of eclipses. As both these\r\nphenomena were occasional, and out of the ordinary course of things,\r\nthey drew exceptional attention as unusual events always do; for it must\r\nbe allowed that quite as wonderful things exist, but they pass unnoticed\r\nmerely because men have grown accustomed to them.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the ancients elected to class comets along with meteors,\r\nthe aurora borealis, and other phenomena of the atmosphere, rather than\r\nwith the planets and the bodies of the spaces beyond. The sudden\r\nappearance of these objects led them to be regarded as signs sent by the\r\ngods to announce remarkable events, chief among these being the deaths\r\nof monarchs. Shakespeare has reminded us of this in those celebrated\r\nlines in _Julius Cæsar_:--\r\n\r\n\"When beggars die there are no comets seen,\r\nThe heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.\"\r\n\r\nNumbed by fear, the men of old blindly accepted these presages of fate;\r\nand did not too closely question whether the threatened danger was to\r\ntheir own nation or to some other, to their ruler or to his enemy. Now\r\nand then, as in the case of the Roman Emperor Vespasian, there was a\r\ncynical attempt to apply some reasoning to the portent. That emperor, in\r\nalluding to the comet of A.D. 79, is reported to have said: \"This hairy\r\nstar does not concern me; it menaces rather the King of the Parthians,\r\nfor he is hairy and I am bald.\" Vespasian, all the same, died shortly\r\nafterwards!\r\n\r\nPliny, in his natural history, gives several instances of the terrible\r\nsignificance which the ancients attached to comets. \"A comet,\" he says,\r\n\"is ordinarily a very fearful star; it announces no small effusion of\r\nblood. We have seen an example of this during the civil commotion of\r\nOctavius.\"\r\n\r\nA very brilliant comet appeared in 371 B.C., and about the same time an\r\nearthquake caused Helicè and Bura, two towns in Achaia, to be swallowed\r\nup by the sea. The following remark made by Seneca concerning it shows\r\nthat the ancients did not consider comets merely as precursors, but even\r\nas actual _causes_ of fatal events: \"This comet, so anxiously observed\r\nby every one, _because of the great catastrophe which it produced as\r\nsoon as it appeared_, the submersion of Bura and Helicè.\"\r\n\r\nComets are by no means rare visitors to our skies, and very few years\r\nhave elapsed in historical times without such objects making their\r\nappearance. In the Dark and Middle Ages, when Europe was split up into\r\nmany small kingdoms and principalities, it was, of course, hardly\r\npossible for a comet to appear without the death of some ruler occurring\r\nnear the time. Critical situations, too, were continually arising in\r\nthose disturbed days. The end of Louis le Debonnaire was hastened, as\r\nthe reader will, no doubt, recollect, by the great eclipse of 840; but\r\nit was firmly believed that a comet which had appeared a year or two\r\npreviously presaged his death. The comet of 1556 is reported to have\r\n_influenced_ the abdication of the Emperor Charles V.; but curiously\r\nenough, this event had already taken place before the comet made its\r\nappearance! Such beliefs, no doubt, had a very real effect upon rulers\r\nof a superstitious nature, or in a weak state of health. For instance,\r\nGian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, was sick when the comet of 1402\r\nappeared. After seeing it, he is said to have exclaimed: \"I render\r\nthanks to God for having decreed that my death should be announced to\r\nmen by this celestial sign.\" His malady then became worse, and he died\r\nshortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed not improbable that such superstitious fears in monarchs\r\nwere fanned by those who would profit by their deaths, and yet did not\r\nwish to stain their own hands with blood.\r\n\r\nEvil though its effects may have been, this morbid interest which past\r\nages took in comets has proved of the greatest service to our science.\r\nHad it not been believed that the appearance of these objects was\r\nattended with far-reaching effects, it is very doubtful whether the old\r\nchroniclers would have given themselves the trouble of alluding to them\r\nat all; and thus the modern investigators of cometary orbits would have\r\nlacked a great deal of important material.\r\n\r\nWe will now mention a few of the most notable comets which historians\r\nhave recorded.\r\n\r\nA comet which appeared in 344 B.C. was thought to betoken the success\r\nof the expedition undertaken in that year by Timoleon of Corinth against\r\nSicily. \"The gods by an extraordinary prodigy announced his success and\r\nfuture greatness: a burning torch appeared in the heavens throughout the\r\nnight and preceded the fleet of Timoleon until it arrived off the coast\r\nof Sicily.\"\r\n\r\nThe comet of 43 B.C. was generally believed to be the soul of Cæsar on\r\nits way to heaven.\r\n\r\nJosephus tells us that in A.D. 69 several prodigies, and amongst them a\r\ncomet in the shape of a sword, announced the destruction of Jerusalem.\r\nThis comet is said to have remained over the city for the space of a\r\nyear!\r\n\r\nA comet which appeared in A.D. 336 was considered to have announced the\r\ndeath of the Emperor Constantine.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most celebrated comet of early times was the one which\r\nappeared in A.D. 1000. That year was, in more than one way, big with\r\nportent, for there had long been a firm belief that the Christian era\r\ncould not possibly run into four figures. Men, indeed, steadfastly\r\nbelieved that when the thousand years had ended, the millennium would\r\nimmediately begin. Therefore they did not reap neither did they sow,\r\nthey toiled not, neither did they spin, and the appearance of the comet\r\nstrengthened their convictions. The fateful year, however, passed by\r\nwithout anything remarkable taking place; but the neglect of husbandry\r\nbrought great famine and pestilence over Europe in the years which\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nIn April 1066, that year fraught with such immense consequences for\r\nEngland, a comet appeared. No one doubted but that it was a presage of\r\nthe success of the Conquest, and perhaps, indeed, it had its due weight\r\nin determining the minds and actions of the men who took part in the\r\nexpedition. _Nova stella, novus rex_ (\"a new star, a new sovereign\") was\r\na favourite proverb of the time. The chroniclers, with one accord, have\r\ndelighted to relate that the Normans, \"guided by a comet,\" invaded\r\nEngland. A representation of this object appears in the Bayeux Tapestry\r\n(see Fig. 19, p. 263).[26]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--The comet of 1066, as represented in the Bayeux\r\nTapestry.\r\n\r\n(From the _World of Comets_.)]\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned Halley's Comet of 1682, and how it revisits the\r\nneighbourhood of the earth at intervals of seventy-six years. The comet\r\nof 1066 has for many years been supposed to be Halley's Comet on one of\r\nits visits. The identity of these two, however, was only quite recently\r\nplaced beyond all doubt by the investigations of Messrs Cowell and\r\nCrommelin. This comet appeared also in 1456, when John Huniades was\r\ndefending Belgrade against the Turks led by Mahomet II., the conqueror\r\nof Constantinople, and is said to have paralysed both armies with fear.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages have left us descriptions of comets, which show only too\r\nwell how the imagination will run riot under the stimulus of terror. For\r\ninstance, the historian, Nicetas, thus describes the comet of the year\r\n1182: \"After the Romans were driven from Constantinople a prognostic was\r\nseen of the excesses and crimes to which Andronicus was to abandon\r\nhimself. A comet appeared in the heavens similar to a writhing serpent;\r\nsometimes it extended itself, sometimes it drew itself in; sometimes, to\r\nthe great terror of the spectators, it opened a huge mouth; it seemed\r\nthat, as if thirsting for human blood, it was upon the point of\r\nsatiating itself.\" And, again, the celebrated Ambrose Paré, the father\r\nof surgery, has left us the following account of the comet of 1528,\r\nwhich appeared in his own time: \"This comet,\" said he, \"was so horrible,\r\nso frightful, and it produced such great terror in the vulgar, that some\r\ndied of fear, and others fell sick. It appeared to be of excessive\r\nlength, and was of the colour of blood. At the summit of it was seen the\r\nfigure of a bent arm, holding in its hand a great sword, as if about to\r\nstrike. At the end of the point there were three stars. On both sides of\r\nthe rays of this comet were seen a great number of axes, knives,\r\nblood-coloured swords, among which were a great number of hideous human\r\nfaces, with beards and bristling hair.\" Paré, it is true, was no\r\nastronomer; yet this shows the effect of the phenomenon, even upon a man\r\nof great learning, as undoubtedly he was. It should here be mentioned\r\nthat nothing very remarkable happened at or near the year 1528.\r\n\r\nConcerning the comet of 1680, the extraordinary story got about that, at\r\nRome, a hen had laid an egg on which appeared a representation of the\r\ncomet!\r\n\r\nBut the superstitions with regard to comets were now nearing their end.\r\nThe last blow was given by Halley, who definitely proved that they\r\nobeyed the laws of gravitation, and circulated around the sun as planets\r\ndo; and further announced that the comet of 1682 had a period of\r\nseventy-six years, which would cause it to reappear in the year 1759. We\r\nhave seen how this prediction was duly verified. We have seen, too, how\r\nthis comet appeared again in 1835, and how it is due to return in the\r\nearly part of 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n[26] With regard to the words \"Isti mirant stella\" in the figure, Mr.\r\nW.T. Lynn suggests that they may not, after all, be the grammatically\r\nbad Latin which they appear, but that the legend is really \"Isti\r\nmirantur stellam,\" the missing letters being supposed to be hidden by\r\nthe building and the comet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMETEORS OR SHOOTING STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nAny one who happens to gaze at the sky for a short time on a clear night\r\nis pretty certain to be rewarded with a view of what is popularly known\r\nas a \"shooting star.\" Such an object, however, is not a star at all, but\r\nhas received its appellation from an analogy; for the phenomenon gives\r\nto the inexperienced in these matters an impression as if one of the\r\nmany points of light, which glitter in the vaulted heaven, had suddenly\r\nbecome loosened from its place, and was falling towards the earth. In\r\nits passage across the sky the moving object leaves behind a trail of\r\nlight which usually lasts for a few moments. Shooting stars, or meteors,\r\nas they are technically termed, are for the most part very small bodies,\r\nperhaps no larger than peas or pebbles, which, dashing towards our earth\r\nfrom space beyond, are heated to a white heat, and reduced to powder by\r\nthe friction resulting from their rapid passage into our atmosphere.\r\nThis they enter at various degrees of speed, in some cases so great as\r\n45 miles a second. The speed, of course, will depend greatly upon\r\nwhether the earth and the meteors are rushing towards each other, or\r\nwhether the latter are merely overtaking the earth. In the first of\r\nthese cases the meteors will naturally collide with the atmosphere with\r\ngreat force; in the other case they will plainly come into it with much\r\nless rapidity. As has been already stated, it is from observations of\r\nsuch bodies that we are enabled to estimate, though very imperfectly,\r\nthe height at which the air around our globe practically ceases, and\r\nthis height is imagined to be somewhere about 100 miles. Fortunate,\r\nindeed, is it for us that there is a goodly layer of atmosphere over our\r\nheads, for, were this not so, these visitors from space would strike\r\nupon the surface of our earth night and day, and render existence still\r\nmore unendurable than many persons choose to consider it. To what a\r\nbombardment must the moon be continually subject, destitute as she is of\r\nsuch an atmospheric shield!\r\n\r\nIt is only in the moment of their dissolution that we really learn\r\nanything about meteors, for these bodies are much too small to be seen\r\nbefore they enter our atmosphere. The débris arising from their\r\ndestruction is wafted over the earth, and, settling down eventually upon\r\nits surface, goes to augment the accumulation of that humble domestic\r\ncommodity which men call dust. This continual addition of material\r\ntends, of course, to increase the mass of the earth, though the effect\r\nthus produced will be on an exceedingly small scale.\r\n\r\nThe total number of meteors moving about in space must be practically\r\ncountless. The number which actually dash into the earth's atmosphere\r\nduring each year is, indeed, very great. Professor Simon Newcomb, the\r\nwell-known American astronomer, has estimated that, of the latter, those\r\nlarge enough to be seen with the naked eye cannot be in all less than\r\n146,000,000,000 per annum. Ten times more numerous still are thought to\r\nbe those insignificant ones which are seen to pass like mere sparks of\r\nlight across the field of an observer's telescope.\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recent times, perhaps up to about a hundred years\r\nago, it was thought that meteors were purely terrestrial phenomena which\r\nhad their origin in the upper regions of the air. It, however, began to\r\nbe noticed that at certain periods of the year these moving objects\r\nappeared to come from definite areas of the sky. Considerations,\r\ntherefore, respecting their observed velocities, directions, and\r\naltitudes, gave rise to the theory that they are swarms of small bodies\r\ntravelling around the sun in elongated elliptical orbits, all along the\r\nlength of which they are scattered, and that the earth, in its annual\r\nrevolution, rushing through the midst of such swarms at the same epoch\r\neach year, naturally entangles many of them in its atmospheric net.\r\n\r\nThe dates at which the earth is expected to pass through the principal\r\nmeteor-swarms are now pretty well known. These swarms are distinguished\r\nfrom one another by the direction of the sky from which the meteors seem\r\nto arrive. Many of the swarms are so wide that the earth takes days, and\r\neven weeks, to pass through them. In some of these swarms, or streams,\r\nas they are also called, the meteors are distributed with fair evenness\r\nalong the entire length of their orbits, so that the earth is greeted\r\nwith a somewhat similar shower at each yearly encounter. In others, the\r\nchief portions are bunched together, so that, in certain years, the\r\ndisplay is exceptional (see Fig. 20, p. 269). That part of the heavens\r\nfrom which a shower of meteors is seen to emanate is called the\r\n\"radiant,\" or radiant point, because the foreshortened view we get of\r\nthe streaks of light makes it appear as if they radiated outwards from\r\nthis point. In observations of these bodies the attention of astronomers\r\nis directed to registering the path and speed of each meteor, and to\r\nascertaining the position of the radiant. It is from data such as these\r\nthat computations concerning the swarms and their orbits are made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Passage of the Earth through the thickest\r\nportion of a Meteor Swarm. The Earth and the Meteors are here\r\nrepresented as approaching each other from opposite directions.]\r\n\r\nFor the present state of knowledge concerning meteors, astronomy is\r\nlargely indebted to the researches of Mr. W.F. Denning, of Bristol, and\r\nof the late Professor A.S. Herschel.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of each year the earth encounters a goodly number of\r\nmeteor-swarms. Three of these, giving rise to fine displays, are very\r\nwell known--the \"Perseids,\" or August Meteors, and the \"Leonids\" and\r\n\"Bielids,\" which appear in November.\r\n\r\nOf the above three the _Leonid_ display is by far the most important,\r\nand the high degree of attention paid to it has laid the foundation of\r\nmeteoric astronomy in much the same way that the study of the\r\nfascinating corona has given such an impetus to our knowledge of the\r\nsun. The history of this shower of meteors may be traced back as far as\r\nA.D. 902, which was known as the \"Year of the Stars.\" It is related that\r\nin that year, on the night of October 12th--the shower now comes about a\r\nmonth later--whilst the Moorish King, Ibrahim Ben Ahmed, lay dying\r\nbefore Cosenza, in Calabria, \"a multitude of falling stars scattered\r\nthemselves across the sky like rain,\" and the beholders shuddered at\r\nwhat they considered a dread celestial portent. We have, however, little\r\nknowledge of the subsequent history of the Leonids until 1698, since\r\nwhich time the maximum shower has appeared with considerable regularity\r\nat intervals of about thirty-three years. But it was not until 1799 that\r\nthey sprang into especial notice. On the 11th November in that year a\r\nsplendid display was witnessed at Cumana, in South America, by the\r\ncelebrated travellers, Humboldt and Bonpland. Finer still, and\r\nsurpassing all displays of the kind ever seen, was that of November 12,\r\n1833, when the meteors fell thick as snowflakes, 240,000 being estimated\r\nto have appeared during seven hours. Some of them were even so bright as\r\nto be seen in full daylight. The radiant from which the meteors seem to\r\ndiverge was ascertained to be situated in the head of the constellation\r\nof the Lion, or \"Sickle of Leo,\" as it is popularly termed, whence\r\ntheir name--Leonids. It was from a discussion of the observations then\r\nmade that the American astronomer, Olmsted, concluded that these meteors\r\nsprang upon us from interplanetary space, and were not, as had been\r\nhitherto thought, born of our atmosphere. Later on, in 1837, Olbers\r\nformulated the theory that the bodies in question travelled around the\r\nsun in an elliptical orbit, and at the same time he established the\r\nperiodicity of the maximum shower.\r\n\r\nThe periodic time of recurrence of this maximum, namely, about\r\nthirty-three years, led to eager expectancy as 1866 drew near. Hopes\r\nwere then fulfilled, and another splendid display took place, of which\r\nSir Robert Ball, who observed it, has given a graphic description in his\r\n_Story of the Heavens_. The display was repeated upon a smaller scale in\r\nthe two following years. The Leonids were henceforth deemed to hold an\r\nanomalous position among meteor swarms. According to theory the earth\r\ncut through their orbit at about the same date each year, and so a\r\ncertain number were then seen to issue from the radiant. But, in\r\naddition, after intervals of thirty-three years, as has been seen, an\r\nexceptional display always took place; and this state of things was not\r\nlimited to one year alone, but was repeated at each meeting for about\r\nthree years running. The further assumption was, therefore, made that\r\nthe swarm was much denser in one portion of the orbit than\r\nelsewhere,[27] and that this congested part was drawn out to such an\r\nextent that the earth could pass through the crossing place during\r\nseveral annual meetings, and still find it going by like a long\r\nprocession (see Fig. 20, p. 269).\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this ascertained period of thirty-three years, the\r\nrecurrence of the great Leonid shower was timed to take place on the\r\n15th of November 1899. But there was disappointment then, and the\r\ndisplays which occurred during the few years following were not of much\r\nimportance. A good deal of comment was made at the time, and theories\r\nwere accordingly put forward to account for the failure of the great\r\nshower. The most probable explanation seems to be, that the attraction\r\nof one of the larger planets--Jupiter perhaps--has diverted the orbit\r\nsomewhat from its old position, and the earth does not in consequence\r\ncut through the swarm in the same manner as it used to do.\r\n\r\nThe other November display alluded to takes place between the 23rd and\r\n27th of that month. It is called the _Andromedid_ Shower, because the\r\nmeteors appear to issue from the direction of the constellation of\r\nAndromeda, which at that period of the year is well overhead during the\r\nearly hours of the night. These meteors are also known by the name of\r\n_Bielids_, from a connection which the orbit assigned to them appears to\r\nhave with that of the well-known comet of Biela.\r\n\r\nM. Egenitis, Director of the Observatory of Athens, accords to the\r\nBielids a high antiquity. He traces the shower back to the days of the\r\nEmperor Justinian. Theophanes, the Chronicler of that epoch, writing of\r\nthe famous revolt of Nika in the year A.D. 532, says:--\"During the same\r\nyear a great fall of stars came from the evening till the dawn.\" M.\r\nEgenitis notes another early reference to these meteors in A.D. 752,\r\nduring the reign of the Eastern Emperor, Constantine Copronymous.\r\nWriting of that year, Nicephorus, a Patriarch of Constantinople, has as\r\nfollows:--\"All the stars appeared to be detached from the sky, and to\r\nfall upon the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bielids, however, do not seem to have attracted particular notice\r\nuntil the nineteenth century. Attention first began to be riveted upon\r\nthem on account of their suspected connection with Biela's comet. It\r\nappeared that the same orbit was shared both by that comet and the\r\nBielid swarm. It will be remembered that the comet in question was not\r\nseen after its appearance in 1852. Since that date, however, the Bielid\r\nshower has shown an increased activity; which was further noticed to be\r\nespecially great in those years in which the comet, had it still\r\nexisted, would be due to pass near the earth.\r\n\r\nThe third of these great showers to which allusion has above been made,\r\nnamely, the _Perseids_, strikes the earth about the 10th of August; for\r\nwhich reason it is known on the Continent under the name of the \"tears\r\nof St. Lawrence,\" the day in question being sacred to that Saint. This\r\nshower is traceable back many centuries, even as far as the year A.D.\r\n811. The name given to these meteors, \"Perseids,\" arises from the fact\r\nthat their radiant point is situated in the constellation of Perseus.\r\nThis shower is, however, not by any means limited to the particular\r\nnight of August 10th, for meteors belonging to the swarm may be observed\r\nto fall in more or less varying quantities from about July 8th to August\r\n22nd. The Perseid meteors sometimes fall at the rate of about sixty per\r\nhour. They are noted for their great rapidity of motion, and their\r\ntrails besides often persist for a minute or two before being\r\ndisseminated. Unlike the other well-known showers, the radiants of which\r\nare stationary, that of the Perseids shifts each night a little in an\r\neasterly direction.\r\n\r\nThe orbit of the Perseids cuts that of the earth almost perpendicularly.\r\nThe bodies are generally supposed to be the result of the disintegration\r\nof an ancient comet which travelled in the same orbit. Tuttle's Comet,\r\nwhich passed close to the earth in 1862, also belongs to this orbit; and\r\nits period of revolution is calculated to be 131 years. The Perseids\r\nappear to be disseminated all along this great orbit, for we meet them\r\nin considerable quantities each year. The bodies in question are in\r\ngeneral particularly small. The swarm has, however, like most others, a\r\nsomewhat denser portion, and through this the earth passed in 1848. The\r\n_aphelion_, or point where the far end of the orbit turns back again\r\ntowards the sun, is situated right away beyond the path of Neptune, at a\r\ndistance of forty-eight times that of the earth from the sun. The comet\r\nof 1532 also belongs to the Perseid orbit. It revisited the\r\nneighbourhood of the earth in 1661, and should have returned in 1789.\r\nBut we have no record of it in that year; for which omission the then\r\npolitically disturbed state of Europe may account. If not already\r\ndisintegrated, this comet is due to return in 1919.\r\n\r\nThis supposed connection between comets and meteor-swarms must be also\r\nextended to the case of the Leonids. These meteors appear to travel\r\nalong the same track as Tempel's Comet of 1866.\r\n\r\nIt is considered that the attractions of the various bodies of the\r\nsolar system upon a meteor swarm must eventually result in breaking up\r\nthe \"bunched\" portion, so that in time the individual meteors should\r\nbecome distributed along the whole length of the orbit. Upon this\r\nassumption the Perseid swarm, in which the meteors are fairly well\r\nscattered along its path, should be of greater age than the Leonid. As\r\nto the Leonid swarm itself, Le Verrier held that it was first brought\r\ninto the solar system in A.D. 126, having been captured from outer space\r\nby the gravitative action of the planet Uranus.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged theory of meteor swarms has naturally given rise to an\r\nidea, that the sunlight shining upon such a large collection of\r\nparticles ought to render a swarm visible before its collision with the\r\nearth's atmosphere. Several attempts have therefore been made to search\r\nfor approaching swarms by photography, but, so far, it appears without\r\nsuccess. It has also been proposed, by Mr. W.H.S. Monck, that the stars\r\nin those regions from which swarms are due, should be carefully watched,\r\nto see if their light exhibits such temporary diminutions as would be\r\nlikely to arise from the momentary interposition of a cloud of moving\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nBetween ten and fifteen years ago it happened that several well-known\r\nobservers, employed in telescopic examination of the sun and moon,\r\nreported that from time to time they had seen small dark bodies,\r\nsometimes singly, sometimes in numbers, in passage across the discs of\r\nthe luminaries. It was concluded that these were meteors moving in space\r\nbeyond the atmosphere of the earth. The bodies were called \"dark\r\nmeteors,\" to emphasise the fact that they were seen in their natural\r\ncondition, and not in that momentary one in which they had hitherto been\r\nalways seen; _i.e._ when heated to white heat, and rapidly vaporised, in\r\nthe course of their passage through the upper regions of our air. This\r\n\"discovery\" gave promise of such assistance to meteor theories, that\r\ncalculations were made from the directions in which they had been seen\r\nto travel, and the speeds at which they had moved, in the hope that some\r\ninformation concerning their orbits might be revealed. But after a while\r\nsome doubt began to be thrown upon their being really meteors, and\r\neventually an Australian observer solved the mystery. He found that they\r\nwere merely tiny particles of dust, or of the black coating on the inner\r\npart of the tube of the telescope, becoming detached from the sides of\r\nthe eye-piece and falling across the field of view. He was led to this\r\nconclusion by having noted that a gentle tapping of his instrument\r\nproduced the \"dark\" bodies in great numbers! Thus the opportunity of\r\nobserving meteors beyond our atmosphere had once more failed.\r\n\r\n_Meteorites_, also known as ærolites and fireballs, are usually placed\r\nin quite a separate category from meteors. They greatly exceed the\r\nlatter in size, are comparatively rare, and do not appear in any way\r\nconnected with the various showers of meteors. The friction of their\r\npassage through the atmosphere causes them to shine with a great light;\r\nand if not shattered to pieces by internal explosions, they reach the\r\nground to bury themselves deep in it with a great rushing and noise.\r\nWhen found by uncivilised peoples, or savages, they are, on account of\r\ntheir celestial origin, usually regarded as objects of wonder and of\r\nworship, and thus have arisen many mythological legends and deifications\r\nof blackened stones. On the other hand, when they get into the\r\npossession of the civilised, they are subjected to careful examinations\r\nand tests in chemical laboratories. The bodies are, as a rule, composed\r\nof stone, in conjunction with iron, nickel, and such elements as exist\r\nin abundance upon our earth; though occasionally specimens are found\r\nwhich are practically pure metal. In the museums of the great capitals\r\nof both Continents are to be seen some fine collections of meteorites.\r\nSeveral countries--Greenland and Mexico, for instance--contain in the\r\nsoil much meteoric iron, often in masses so large as to baffle all\r\nattempts at removal. Blocks of this kind have been known to furnish the\r\nnatives in their vicinity for many years with sources of workable iron.\r\n\r\nThe largest meteorite in the world is one known as the Anighito\r\nmeteorite. It was brought to the United States by the explorer Peary,\r\nwho found it at Cape York in Greenland. He estimates its weight at from\r\n90 to 100 tons. One found in Mexico, called the Bacubirito, comes next,\r\nwith an estimated weight of 27-1/2 tons. The third in size is the\r\nWillamette meteorite, found at Willamette in Oregon in 1902. It measures\r\n10 × 6-1/2 × 4-1/2 feet, and weighs about 15-1/2 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n[27] The \"gem\" of the meteor ring, as it has been termed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapters we have dealt at length with those celestial\r\nbodies whose nearness to us brings them into our especial notice. The\r\nentire room, however, taken up by these bodies, is as a mere point in\r\nthe immensities of star-filled space. The sun, too, is but an ordinary\r\nstar; perhaps quite an insignificant one[28] in comparison with the\r\nmajority of those which stud that background of sky against which the\r\nplanets are seen to perform their wandering courses.\r\n\r\nDropping our earth and the solar system behind, let us go afield and\r\nexplore the depths of space.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, in very early times, men portioned out the great mass\r\nof the so-called \"fixed stars\" into divisions known as constellations.\r\nThe various arrangements, into which the brilliant points of light fell\r\nas a result of perspective, were noticed and roughly compared with such\r\nforms as were familiar to men upon the earth. Imagination quickly saw in\r\nthem the semblances of heroes and of mighty fabled beasts; and, around\r\nthese monstrous shapes, legends were woven, which told how the great\r\ndeeds done in the misty dawn of historical time had been enshrined by\r\nthe gods in the sky as an example and a memorial for men. Though the\r\ncenturies have long outlived such fantasies, yet the constellation\r\nfigures and their ancient names have been retained to this day, pretty\r\nwell unaltered for want of any better arrangement. The Great and Little\r\nBears, Cassiopeia, Perseus, and Andromeda, Orion and the rest, glitter\r\nin our night skies just as they did centuries and centuries ago.\r\n\r\nMany persons seem to despair of gaining any real knowledge of astronomy,\r\nmerely because they are not versed in recognising the constellations.\r\nFor instance, they will say:--\"What is the use of my reading anything\r\nabout the subject? Why, I believe I couldn't even point out the Great\r\nBear, were I asked to do so!\" But if such persons will only consider for\r\na moment that what we call the Great Bear has no existence in fact, they\r\nneed not be at all disheartened. Could we but view this familiar\r\nconstellation from a different position in space, we should perhaps be\r\nquite unable to recognise it. Mountain masses, for instance, when seen\r\nfrom new directions, are often unrecognisable.\r\n\r\nIt took, as we have seen, a very long time for men to acknowledge the\r\nimmense distances of the stars from our earth. Their seeming\r\nunchangeableness of position was, as we have seen, largely responsible\r\nfor the idea that the earth was immovable in space. It is a wonder that\r\nthe Copernican system ever gained the day in the face of this apparent\r\nfixity of the stars. As time went on, it became indeed necessary to\r\naccord to these objects an almost inconceivable distance, in order to\r\naccount for the fact that they remained apparently quite undisplaced,\r\nnotwithstanding the journey of millions of miles which the earth was now\r\nacknowledged to make each year around the sun. In the face of the\r\ngradual and immense improvement in telescopes, this apparent immobility\r\nof the stars was, however, not destined to last. The first ascertained\r\ndisplacement of a star, namely that of 61 Cygni, noted by Bessel in the\r\nyear 1838, definitely proved to men the truth of the Copernican system.\r\nSince then some forty more stars have been found to show similar tiny\r\ndisplacements. We are, therefore, in possession of the fact, that the\r\nactual distances of a few out of the great host can be calculated.\r\n\r\nTo mention some of these. The nearest star to the earth, so far as we\r\nyet know, is Alpha Centauri, which is distant from us about 25 billions\r\nof miles. The light from this star, travelling at the stupendous rate of\r\nabout 186,000 miles per second, takes about 4-1/4 years to reach our\r\nearth, or, to speak astronomically, Alpha Centauri is about 4-1/4 \"light\r\nyears\" distant from us. Sirius--the brightest star in the whole sky--is\r\nat twice this distance, _i.e._ about 8-1/2 light years. Vega is about 30\r\nlight years distant from us, Capella about 32, and Arcturus about 100.\r\n\r\nThe displacements, consequent on the earth's movement, have, however,\r\nplainly nothing to say to any real movements on the part of the stars\r\nthemselves. The old idea was that the stars were absolutely fixed; hence\r\narose the term \"fixed stars\"--a term which, though inaccurate, has not\r\nyet been entirely banished from the astronomical vocabulary. But careful\r\nobservations extending over a number of years have shown slight changes\r\nof position among these bodies; and such alterations cannot be ascribed\r\nto the revolution of the earth in its orbit, for they appear to take\r\nplace in every direction. These evidences of movement are known as\r\n\"proper motions,\" that is to say, actual motions in space proper to the\r\nstars themselves. Stars which are comparatively near to us show, as a\r\nrule, greater proper motions than those which are farther off. It must\r\nnot, however, be concluded that these proper motions are of any very\r\nnoticeable amounts. They are, as a matter of fact, merely upon the same\r\napparently minute scale as other changes in the heavens; and would\r\nlargely remain unnoticed were it not for the great precision of modern\r\nastronomical instruments.\r\n\r\nOne of the swiftest moving of the stars is a star of the sixth magnitude\r\nin the constellation of the Great Bear; which is known as \"1830\r\nGroombridge,\" because this was the number assigned to it in a catalogue\r\nof stars made by an astronomer of that name. It is popularly known as\r\nthe \"Runaway Star,\" a name given to it by Professor Newcomb. Its speed\r\nis estimated to be at least 138 miles per second. It may be actually\r\nmoving at a much greater rate, for it is possible that we see its path\r\nsomewhat foreshortened.\r\n\r\nA still greater proper motion--the greatest, in fact, known--is that of\r\nan eighth magnitude star in the southern hemisphere, in the\r\nconstellation of Pictor. Nothing, indeed, better shows the enormous\r\ndistance of the stars from us, and the consequent inability of even such\r\nrapid movements to alter the appearance of the sky during the course of\r\nages, than the fact that it would take more than two centuries for the\r\nstar in question to change its position in the sky by a space equal to\r\nthe apparent diameter of the moon; a statement which is equivalent to\r\nsaying that, were it possible to see this star with the naked eye, which\r\nit is not, at least twenty-five years would have to elapse before one\r\nwould notice that it had changed its place at all!\r\n\r\nBoth the stars just mentioned are very faint. That in Pictor is, as has\r\nbeen said, not visible to the naked eye. It appears besides to be a very\r\nsmall body, for Sir David Gill finds a parallax which makes it only as\r\nfar off from us as Sirius. The Groombridge star, too, is just about the\r\nlimit of ordinary visibility. It is, indeed, a curious fact that the\r\nfainter stars seem, on the average, to be moving more rapidly than the\r\nbrighter.\r\n\r\nInvestigations into proper motions lead us to think that every one of\r\nthe stars must be moving in space in some particular direction. To take\r\na few of the best known. Sirius and Vega are both approaching our system\r\nat a rate of about 10 miles per second, Arcturus at about 5 miles per\r\nsecond, while Capella is receding from us at about 15 miles per second.\r\nOf the twin brethren, Castor and Pollux, Castor is moving away from us\r\nat about 4-1/2 miles per second, while Pollux is coming towards us at\r\nabout 33 miles per second.\r\n\r\nMuch of our knowledge of proper motions has been obtained indirectly by\r\nmeans of the spectroscope, on the Doppler principle already treated of,\r\nby which we are enabled to ascertain whether a source from which light\r\nis coming is approaching or receding.\r\n\r\nThe sun being, after all, a mere star, it will appear only natural for\r\nit also to have a proper motion of its own. This is indeed the case; and\r\nit is rushing along in space at a rate of between ten and twelve miles\r\nper second, carrying with it its whole family of planets and satellites,\r\nof comets and meteors. The direction in which it is advancing is towards\r\na point in the constellation of Lyra, not far from its chief star Vega.\r\nThis is shown by the fact that the stars about the region in question\r\nappear to be opening out slightly, while those in the contrary portion\r\nof the sky appear similarly to be closing together.\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel was the first to discover this motion of the sun\r\nthrough space; though in the idea that such a movement might take place\r\nhe seems to have been anticipated by Mayer in 1760, by Michell in 1767,\r\nand by Lalande in 1776.\r\n\r\nA suggestion has been made that our solar system, in its motion through\r\nthe celestial spaces, may occasionally pass through regions where\r\nabnormal magnetic conditions prevail, in consequence of which\r\ndisturbances may manifest themselves throughout the system at the same\r\ninstant. Thus the sun may be getting the credit of _producing_ what it\r\nmerely reacts to in common with the rest of its family. But this\r\nsuggestion, plausible though it may seem, will not explain why the\r\nmagnetic disturbances experienced upon our earth show a certain\r\ndependence upon such purely local facts, as the period of the sun's\r\nrotation, for instance.\r\n\r\nOne would very much like to know whether the movement of the sun is\r\nalong a straight line, or in an enormous orbit around some centre. The\r\nidea has been put forward that it may be moving around the centre of\r\ngravity of the whole visible stellar universe. Mädler, indeed,\r\npropounded the notion that Alcyone--the chief star in the group known as\r\nthe Pleiades--occupied this centre, and that everything revolved around\r\nit. He went even further to proclaim that here was the Place of the\r\nAlmighty, the Mansion of the Eternal! But Mädler's ideas upon this point\r\nhave long been shelved.\r\n\r\nTo return to the general question of the proper motion of stars.\r\n\r\nIn several instances these motions appear to take place in groups, as if\r\ncertain stars were in some way associated together. For example, a large\r\nnumber of the stars composing the Pleiades appear to be moving through\r\nspace in the same direction. Also, of the seven stars composing the\r\nPlough, all but two--the star at the end of its \"handle,\" and that one\r\nof the \"pointers,\" as they are called, which is the nearer to the pole\r\nstar--have a common proper motion, _i.e._ are moving in the same\r\ndirection and nearly at the same rate.\r\n\r\nFurther still, the well-known Dutch astronomer, Professor Kapteyn, of\r\nGroningen, has lately reached the astonishing conclusion that a great\r\npart of the visible universe is occupied by two vast streams of stars\r\ntravelling in opposite directions. In both these great streams, the\r\nindividual bodies are found, besides, to be alike in design, alike in\r\nchemical constitution, and alike in the stage of their development.\r\n\r\nA fable related by the Persian astronomer, Al Sufi (tenth century, A.D.)\r\nshows well the changes in the face of the sky which proper motions are\r\nbound to produce after great lapses of time. According to this fable the\r\nstars Sirius and Procyon were the sisters of the star Canopus. Canopus\r\nmarried Rigel (another star,) but, having murdered her, he fled towards\r\nthe South Pole, fearing the anger of his sisters. The fable goes on to\r\nrelate, among other things, that Sirius followed him across the Milky\r\nWay. Mr. J. E. Gore, in commenting on the story, thinks that it may be\r\nbased upon a tradition of Sirius having been seen by the men of the\r\nStone Age on the opposite side of the Milky Way to that on which it now\r\nis.\r\n\r\nSirius is in that portion of the heavens _from_ which the sun is\r\nadvancing. Its proper motion is such that it is gaining upon the earth\r\nat the rate of about ten miles per second, and so it must overtake the\r\nsun after the lapse of great ages. Vega, on the other hand, is coming\r\ntowards us from that part of the sky _towards_ which the sun is\r\ntravelling. It should be about half a million years before the sun and\r\nVega pass by one another. Those who have specially investigated this\r\nquestion say that, as regards the probability of a near approach, it is\r\nmuch more likely that Vega will be then so far to one side of the sun,\r\nthat her brightness will not be much greater than it is at this moment.\r\n\r\nConsiderations like these call up the chances of stellar collisions.\r\nSuch possibilities need not, however, give rise to alarm; for the stars,\r\nas a rule, are at such great distances from each other, that the\r\nprobability of relatively near approaches is slight.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the constellations do not in effect exist, and that\r\nthere is in truth no real background to the sky. We find further that\r\nthe stars are strewn through space at immense distances from each other,\r\nand are moving in various directions hither and thither. The sun, which\r\nis merely one of them, is moving also in a certain direction, carrying\r\nthe solar system along with it. It seems, therefore, but natural to\r\nsuppose that many a star may be surrounded by some planetary system in a\r\nway similar to ours, which accompanies it through space in the course of\r\nits celestial journeyings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[28] Vega, for instance, shines one hundred times more brightly than the\r\nsun would do, were it to be removed to the distance at which that star\r\nis from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE STARS--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars appear to us to be scattered about the sky without any orderly\r\narrangement. Further, they are of varying degrees of brightness; some\r\nbeing extremely brilliant, whilst others can but barely be seen. The\r\nbrightness of a star may arise from either of two causes. On the one\r\nhand, the body may be really very bright in itself; on the other hand,\r\nit may be situated comparatively near to us. Sometimes, indeed, both\r\nthese circumstances may come into play together.\r\n\r\nSince variation in brightness is the most noticeable characteristic of\r\nthe stars, men have agreed to class them in divisions called\r\n\"magnitudes.\" This term, it must be distinctly understood, is employed\r\nin such classification without any reference whatever to actual size,\r\nbeing merely taken to designate roughly the amount of light which we\r\nreceive from a star. The twenty brightest stars in the sky are usually\r\nclassed in the first magnitude. In descending the scale, each magnitude\r\nwill be noticed to contain, broadly speaking, three times as many stars\r\nas the one immediately above it. Thus the second magnitude contains 65,\r\nthe third 190, the fourth 425, the fifth 1100, and the sixth 3200. The\r\nlast of these magnitudes is about the limit of the stars which we are\r\nable to see with the naked eye. Adding, therefore, the above numbers\r\ntogether, we find that, without the aid of the telescope, we cannot see\r\nmore than about 5000 stars in the entire sky--northern and southern\r\nhemispheres included. Quite a small telescope will, however, allow us to\r\nsee down to the ninth magnitude, so that the total number of stars\r\nvisible to us with such very moderate instrumental means will be well\r\nover 100,000.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the stars included within each\r\nmagnitude are all of exactly the same brightness. In fact, it would be\r\ndifficult to say if there exist in the whole sky two stars which send us\r\nprecisely the same amount of light. In arranging the magnitudes, all\r\nthat was done was to make certain broad divisions, and to class within\r\nthem such stars as were much on a par with regard to brightness. It may\r\nhere be noted that a standard star of the first magnitude gives us about\r\none hundred times as much light as a star of the sixth magnitude, and\r\nabout one million times as much as one of the sixteenth magnitude--which\r\nis near the limit of what we can see with the very best telescope.\r\n\r\nThough the first twenty stars in the sky are popularly considered as\r\nbeing of the first magnitude, yet several of them are much brighter than\r\nan average first magnitude star would be. For instance, Sirius--the\r\nbrightest star in the whole sky--is equal to about eleven first\r\nmagnitude stars, like, say, Aldebaran. In consequence of such\r\ndifferences, astronomers are agreed in classifying the brightest of them\r\nas _brighter_ than the standard first magnitude star. On this principle\r\nSirius would be about two and a half magnitudes _above_ the first. This\r\nnotation is usefully employed in making comparisons between the amount\r\nof light which we receive from the sun, and that which we get from an\r\nindividual star. Thus the sun will be about twenty-seven and a half\r\nmagnitudes _above_ the first magnitude. The range, therefore, between\r\nthe light which we receive from the sun (considered merely as a very\r\nbright star) and the first magnitude stars is very much greater than\r\nthat between the latter and the faintest star which can be seen with the\r\ntelescope, or even registered upon the photographic plate.\r\n\r\nTo classify stars merely by their magnitudes, without some definite note\r\nof their relative position in the sky, would be indeed of little avail.\r\nWe must have some simple method of locating them in the memory, and the\r\nconstellations of the ancients here happily come to our aid. A system\r\ncombining magnitudes with constellations was introduced by Bayer in\r\n1603, and is still adhered to. According to this the stars in each\r\nconstellation, beginning with the brightest star, are designated by the\r\nletters of the Greek alphabet taken in their usual order. For example,\r\nin the constellation of Canis Major, or the Greater Dog, the brightest\r\nstar is the well-known Sirius, called by the ancients the \"Dog Star\";\r\nand this star, in accordance with Bayer's method, has received the Greek\r\nletter [a] (alpha), and is consequently known as Alpha Canis\r\nMajoris.[29] As soon as the Greek letters are used up in this way the\r\nRoman alphabet is brought into requisition, after which recourse is had\r\nto ordinary numbers.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this convenient arrangement, some of the brightest\r\nstars are nearly always referred to by certain proper names given to\r\nthem in old times. For instance, it is more usual to speak of Sirius,\r\nArcturus, Vega, Capella, Procyon, Aldebaran, Regulus, and so on, than of\r\n[a] Canis Majoris, [a] Boötis, [a] Lyræ, [a] Aurigæ, [a] Canis Minoris,\r\n[a] Tauri, [a] Leonis, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIn order that future generations might be able to ascertain what changes\r\nwere taking place in the face of the sky, astronomers have from time to\r\ntime drawn up catalogues of stars. These lists have included stars of a\r\ncertain degree of brightness, their positions in the sky being noted\r\nwith the utmost accuracy possible at the period. The earliest known\r\ncatalogue of this kind was made, as we have seen, by the celebrated\r\nGreek astronomer, Hipparchus, about the year 125 B.C. It contained 1080\r\nstars. It was revised and brought up to date by Ptolemy in A.D. 150.\r\nAnother celebrated list was that drawn up by the Persian astronomer, Al\r\nSufi, about the year A.D. 964. In it 1022 stars were noted down. A\r\ncatalogue of 1005 stars was made in 1580 by the famous Danish\r\nastronomer, Tycho Brahe. Among modern catalogues that of Argelander\r\n(1799-1875) contained as many as 324,198 stars. It was extended by\r\nSchönfeld so as to include a portion of the Southern Hemisphere, in\r\nwhich way 133,659 more stars were added.\r\n\r\nIn recent years a project was placed on foot of making a photographic\r\nsurvey of the sky, the work to be portioned out among various nations. A\r\ngreat part of this work has already been brought to a conclusion. About\r\n15,000,000 stars will appear upon the plates; but, so far, it has been\r\nproposed to catalogue only about a million and a quarter of the\r\nbrightest of them. This idea of surveying the face of the sky by\r\nphotography sprang indirectly from the fine photographs which Sir David\r\nGill took, when at the Cape of Good Hope, of the Comet of 1882. The\r\nimmense number of star-images which had appeared upon his plates\r\nsuggested the idea that photography could be very usefully employed to\r\nregister the relative positions of the stars.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of seven stars known as the \"Plough\" is perhaps the most\r\nfamiliar configuration in the sky (see Plate XIX., p. 292). In the\r\nUnited States it is called the \"Dipper,\" on account of its likeness to\r\nthe outline of a saucepan, or ladle. \"Charles' Wain\" was the old English\r\nname for it, and readers of Cæsar will recollect it under\r\n_Septentriones_, or the \"Seven Stars,\" a term which that writer uses as\r\na synonym for the North. Though identified in most persons' minds with\r\n_Ursa Major_, or the Great Bear, the Plough is actually only a small\r\nportion of that famous constellation. Six out of the seven stars which\r\ngo to make up the well-known figure are of the second magnitude, while\r\nthe remaining one, which is the middle star of the group, is of the\r\nthird.\r\n\r\nThe Greek letters, as borne by the individual stars of the Plough, are a\r\nplain transgression of Bayer's method as above described, for they have\r\ncertainly not been allotted here in accordance with the proper order of\r\nbrightness. For instance, the third magnitude star, just alluded to as\r\nbeing in the middle of the group, has been marked with the Greek letter\r\n[d] (Delta); and so is made to take rank _before_ the stars composing\r\nwhat is called the \"handle\" of the Plough, which are all of the second\r\nmagnitude. Sir William Herschel long ago drew attention to the irregular\r\nmanner in which Bayer's system had been applied. It is, indeed, a great\r\npity that this notation was not originally worked out with greater care\r\nand correctness; for, were it only reliable, it would afford great\r\nassistance to astronomers in judging of what changes in relative\r\nbrightness have taken place among the stars.\r\n\r\nThough we may speak of using the constellations as a method of finding\r\nour way about the sky, it is, however, to certain marked groupings in\r\nthem of the brighter stars that we look for our sign-posts.\r\n\r\nMost of the constellations contain a group or so of noticeable stars,\r\nwhose accidental arrangement dimly recalls the outline of some familiar\r\ngeometrical figure and thus arrests the attention.[30] For instance, in\r\nan almost exact line with the two front stars of the Plough, or\r\n\"pointers\" as they are called,[31] and at a distance about five times as\r\nfar away as the interval between them, there will be found a third star\r\nof the second magnitude. This is known as Polaris, or the Pole Star, for\r\nit very nearly occupies that point of the heaven towards which the north\r\npole of the earth's axis is _at present_ directed (see Plate XIX., p.\r\n292). Thus during the apparently daily rotation of the heavens, this\r\nstar looks always practically stationary. It will, no doubt, be\r\nremembered how Shakespeare has put into the mouth of Julius Cæsar these\r\nmemorable words:--\r\n\r\n\"But I am constant as the northern star,\r\nOf whose true-fix'd and resting quality\r\nThere is no fellow in the firmament.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX. THE SKY AROUND THE NORTH POLE\r\n\r\nWe see here the Plough, the Pole Star, Ursa Minor, Auriga, Cassiopeia's\r\nChair, and Lyra. Also the Circle of Precession, along which the Pole\r\nmakes a complete revolution in a period of 25,868 years, and the\r\nTemporary Star discovered by Tycho Brahe in the year 1572.\r\n\r\n(Page 291)]\r\n\r\nOn account of the curvature of the earth's surface, the height at which\r\nthe Pole Star is seen above the horizon at any place depends regularly\r\nupon the latitude; that is to say, the distance of the place in question\r\nfrom the equator. For instance, at the north pole of the earth, where\r\nthe latitude is greatest, namely, 90°, the Pole Star will appear\r\ndirectly overhead; whereas in England, where the latitude is about 50°,\r\nit will be seen a little more than half way up the northern sky. At the\r\nequator, where the latitude is _nil_, the Pole Star will be on the\r\nhorizon due north.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of its unique position, the Pole Star is of very great\r\nservice in the study of the constellations. It is a kind of centre\r\naround which to hang our celestial ideas--a starting point, so to speak,\r\nin our voyages about the sky.\r\n\r\nAccording to the constellation figures, the Pole Star is in _Ursa\r\nMinor_, or the Little Bear, and is situated at the end of the tail of\r\nthat imaginary figure (see Plate XIX., p. 292). The chief stars of this\r\nconstellation form a group not unlike the Plough, except that the\r\n\"handle\" is turned in the contrary direction. The Americans, in\r\nconsequence, speak of it as the \"Little Dipper.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this region of the sky, it will be well to draw attention\r\nto the second magnitude star [z] in the Great Bear (Zeta Ursæ Majoris),\r\nwhich is the middle star in the \"handle\" of the Plough. This star is\r\nusually known as Mizar, a name given to it by the Arabians. A person\r\nwith good eyesight can see quite near to it a fifth magnitude star,\r\nknown under the name of Alcor. We have here a very good example of that\r\ndeception in the estimation of objects in the sky, which has been\r\nalluded to in an earlier chapter. Alcor is indeed distant from Mizar by\r\nabout one-third the apparent diameter of the moon, yet no one would\r\nthink so!\r\n\r\nOn the other side of Polaris from the Plough, and at about an equal\r\napparent distance, will be found a figure in the form of an irregular\r\n\"W\", made up of second and third magnitude stars. This is the well-known\r\n\"Cassiopeia's Chair\"--portion of the constellation of _Cassiopeia_ (see\r\nPlate XIX., p. 292).\r\n\r\nOn either side of the Pole Star, about midway between the Plough and\r\nCassiopeia's Chair, but a little further off from it than these, are the\r\nconstellations of _Auriga_ and _Lyra_ (see Plate XIX., p. 292). The\r\nformer constellation will be easily recognised, because its chief\r\nfeatures are a brilliant yellowish first magnitude star, with one of the\r\nsecond magnitude not far from it. The first magnitude star is Capella,\r\nthe other is [b] Aurigæ. Lyra contains only one first magnitude\r\nstar--Vega, pale blue in colour. This star has a certain interest for us\r\nfrom the fact that, as a consequence of that slow shift of direction of\r\nthe earth's axis known as Precession, it will be very near the north\r\npole of the heavens in some 12,000 years, and so will then be considered\r\nthe pole star (see Plate XIX., p. 292). The constellation of Lyra\r\nitself, it must also be borne in mind, occupies that region of the\r\nheavens towards which the solar system is travelling.\r\n\r\nThe handle of the Plough points roughly towards the constellation of\r\n_Boötes_, in which is the brilliant first magnitude star Arcturus. This\r\nstar is of an orange tint.\r\n\r\nBetween Boötes and Lyra lie the constellations of _Corona Borealis_ (or\r\nthe Northern Crown) and _Hercules_. The chief feature of Corona\r\nBorealis, which is a small constellation, is a semicircle of six small\r\nstars, the brightest of which is of the second magnitude. The\r\nconstellation of Hercules is very extensive, but contains no star\r\nbrighter than the third magnitude.\r\n\r\nNear to Lyra, on the side away from Hercules, are the constellations of\r\n_Cygnus_ and _Aquila_. Of the two, the former is the nearer to the Pole\r\nStar, and will be recognised by an arrangement of stars widely set in\r\nthe form of a cross, or perhaps indeed more like the framework of a\r\nboy's kite. The position of Aquila will be found through the fact that\r\nthree of its brightest stars are almost in a line and close together.\r\nThe middle of these is Altair, a yellowish star of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance from Ursa Major, on the side away from the Pole\r\nStar, is the constellation of _Leo_, or the Lion. Its chief feature is a\r\nseries of seven stars, supposed to form the head of that animal. The\r\narrangement of these stars is, however, much more like a sickle,\r\nwherefore this portion of the constellation is usually known as the\r\n\"Sickle of Leo.\" At the end of the handle of the sickle is a white first\r\nmagnitude star--Regulus.\r\n\r\nThe reader will, no doubt, recollect that it is from a point in the\r\nSickle of Leo that the Leonid meteors appear to radiate.\r\n\r\nThe star second in brightness in the constellation of Leo is known as\r\nDenebola. This star, now below the second magnitude, seems to have been\r\nvery much brighter in the past. It is noted, indeed, as a brilliant\r\nfirst magnitude star by Al Sufi, that famous Persian astronomer who\r\nlived, as we have seen, in the tenth century. Ptolemy also notes it as\r\nof the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Auriga, and further than it from the Pole Star,\r\nare several remarkable constellations--Taurus, Orion, Gemini, Canis\r\nMinor, and Canis Major (see Plate XX., p. 296).\r\n\r\nThe first of these, _Taurus_ (or the Bull), contains two conspicuous\r\nstar groups--the Pleiades and the Hyades. The Pleiades are six or seven\r\nsmall stars quite close together, the majority of which are of the\r\nfourth magnitude. This group is sometimes occulted by the moon. The way\r\nin which the stars composing it are arranged is somewhat similar to that\r\nin the Plough, though of course on a scale ever so much smaller. The\r\nimpression which the group itself gives to the casual glance is thus\r\nadmirably pictured in Tennyson's _Locksley Hall_:--\r\n\r\n\"Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising through the mellow shade,\r\nGlitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX. ORION AND HIS NEIGHBOURS\r\n\r\nWe see here that magnificent region of the sky which contains the\r\nbrightest star of all--Sirius. Note also especially the Milky Way, the\r\nPleiades, the Hyades, and the \"Belt\" and \"Sword\" of Orion.\r\n\r\n(Page 296)]\r\n\r\nThe group of the Hyades occupies the \"head\" of the Bull, and is much\r\nmore spread out than that of the Pleiades. It is composed besides of\r\nbrighter stars, the brightest being one of the first magnitude,\r\nAldebaran. This star is of a red colour, and is sometimes known as the\r\n\"Eye of the Bull.\"\r\n\r\nThe constellation of _Orion_ is easily recognised as an irregular\r\nquadrilateral formed of four bright stars, two of which, Betelgeux\r\n(reddish) and Rigel (brilliant white), are of the first magnitude. In\r\nthe middle of the quadrilateral is a row of three second magnitude\r\nstars, known as the \"Belt\" of Orion. Jutting off from this is another\r\nrow of stars called the \"Sword\" of Orion.\r\n\r\nThe constellation of _Gemini_, or the Twins, contains two bright\r\nstars--Castor and Pollux--close to each other. Pollux, though marked\r\nwith the Greek letter [b], is the brighter of the two, and nearly of the\r\nstandard first magnitude.\r\n\r\nJust further from the Pole than Gemini, is the constellation of _Canis\r\nMinor_, or the Lesser Dog. Its chief star is a white first magnitude\r\none--Procyon.\r\n\r\nStill further again from the Pole than Canis Minor is the constellation\r\nof _Canis Major_, or the Greater Dog. It contains the brightest star in\r\nthe whole sky, the first magnitude star Sirius, bluish-white in colour,\r\nalso known as the \"Dog Star.\" This star is almost in line with the stars\r\nforming the Belt of Orion, and is not far from that constellation.\r\n\r\nTaken in the following order, the stars Capella, [b] Aurigæ, Castor,\r\nPollux, Procyon, and Sirius, when they are all above the horizon at the\r\nsame time, form a beautiful curve stretching across the heaven.\r\n\r\nThe groups of stars visible in the southern skies have by no means the\r\nsame fascination for us as those in the northern. The ancients were in\r\ngeneral unacquainted with the regions beyond the equator, and so their\r\nscheme of constellations did not include the sky around the South Pole\r\nof the heavens. In modern times, however, this part of the celestial\r\nexpanse was also portioned out into constellations for the purpose of\r\neasy reference; but these groupings plainly lack that simplicity of\r\nconception and legendary interest which are so characteristic of the\r\nolder ones.\r\n\r\nThe brightest star in the southern skies is found in the constellation\r\nof _Argo_, and is known as Canopus. In brightness it comes next to\r\nSirius, and so is second in that respect in the entire heaven. It does\r\nnot, however, rise above the English horizon.\r\n\r\nOf the other southern constellations, two call for especial notice, and\r\nthese adjoin each other. One is _Centaurus_ (or the Centaur), which\r\ncontains the two first magnitude stars, [a] and [b] Centauri. The first\r\nof these, Alpha Centauri, comes next in brightness to Canopus, and is\r\nnotable as being the nearest of all the stars to our earth. The other\r\nconstellation is called _Crux_, and contains five stars set in the form\r\nof a rough cross, known as the \"Southern Cross.\" The brightest of these,\r\n[a] Crucis, is of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nOwing to the Precession of the Equinoxes, which, as we have seen,\r\ngradually shifts the position of the Pole among the stars, certain\r\nconstellations used to be visible in ancient times in more northerly\r\nlatitudes than at present. For instance, some five thousand years ago\r\nthe Southern Cross rose above the English horizon, and was just visible\r\nin the latitude of London. It has, however, long ago even ceased to be\r\nseen in the South of Europe. The constellation of Crux happens to be\r\nsituated in that remarkable region of the southern skies, in which are\r\nfound the stars Canopus and Alpha Centauri, and also the most brilliant\r\nportion of the Milky Way. It is believed to be to this grand celestial\r\nregion that allusion is made in the Book of Job (ix. 9), under the title\r\nof the \"Chambers of the South.\" The \"Cross\" must have been still a\r\nnotable feature in the sky of Palestine in the days when that ancient\r\npoem was written.\r\n\r\nThere is no star near enough to the southern pole of the heavens to earn\r\nthe distinction of South Polar Star.\r\n\r\nThe Galaxy, or _Milky Way_ (see Plate XX., p. 296), is a broad band of\r\ndiffused light which is seen to stretch right around the sky. The\r\ntelescope, however, shows it to be actually composed of a great host of\r\nvery faint stars--too faint, indeed, to be separately distinguished with\r\nthe naked eye. Along a goodly stretch of its length it is cleft in two;\r\nwhile near the south pole of the heavens it is entirely cut across by a\r\ndark streak.\r\n\r\nIn this rapid survey of the face of the sky, we have not been able to do\r\nmore than touch in the broadest manner upon some of the most noticeable\r\nstar groups and a few of the most remarkable stars. To go any further is\r\nnot a part of our purpose; our object being to deal with celestial\r\nbodies as they actually are, and not in those groupings under which they\r\ndisplay themselves to us as a mere result of perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n[29] Attention must here be drawn to the fact that the name of the\r\nconstellation is always put in the genitive case.\r\n\r\n[30] The early peoples, as we have seen, appear to have been attracted\r\nby those groupings of the stars which reminded them in a way of the\r\nfigures of men and animals. We moderns, on the other hand, seek almost\r\ninstinctively for geometrical arrangements. This is, perhaps,\r\nsymptomatic of the evolution of the race. In the growth of the\r\nindividual we find, for example, something analogous. A child, who has\r\nbeen given pencil and paper, is almost certain to produce grotesque\r\ndrawings of men and animals; whereas the idle and half-conscious\r\nscribblings which a man may make upon his blotting-paper are usually of\r\na geometrical character.\r\n\r\n[31] Because the line joining them _points_ in the direction of the Pole\r\nStar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS OF STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nMany stars are seen comparatively close together. This may plainly arise\r\nfrom two reasons. Firstly, the stars may happen to be almost in the same\r\nline of sight; that is to say, seen in nearly the same direction; and\r\nthough one star may be ever so much nearer to us than the other, the\r\nresult will give all the appearance of a related pair. A seeming\r\narrangement of two stars in this way is known as a \"double,\" or double\r\nstar; or, indeed, to be very precise, an \"optical double.\" Secondly, in\r\na pair of stars, both bodies may be about the same distance from us, and\r\nactually connected as a system like, for instance, the moon and the\r\nearth. A pairing of stars in this way, though often casually alluded to\r\nas a double star, is properly termed a \"binary,\" or binary system.\r\n\r\nBut collocations of stars are by no means limited to two. We find,\r\nindeed, all over the sky such arrangements in which there are three or\r\nmore stars; and these are technically known as \"triple\" or \"multiple\"\r\nstars respectively. Further, groups are found in which a great number of\r\nstars are closely massed together, such a massing together of stars\r\nbeing known as a \"cluster.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pole Star (Polaris) is a double star, one of the components being of\r\na little below the second magnitude, and the other a little below the\r\nninth. They are so close together that they appear as one star to the\r\nnaked eye, but they may be seen separate with a moderately sized\r\ntelescope. The brighter star is yellowish, and the faint one white. This\r\nbrighter star is found _by means of the spectroscope_ to be actually\r\ncomposed of three stars so very close together that they cannot be seen\r\nseparately even with a telescope. It is thus a triple star, and the\r\nthree bodies of which it is composed are in circulation about each\r\nother. Two of them are darker than the third.\r\n\r\nThe method of detecting binary stars by means of the spectroscope is an\r\napplication of Doppler's principle. It will, no doubt, be remembered\r\nthat, according to the principle in question, we are enabled, from\r\ncertain shiftings of the lines in the spectrum of a luminous body, to\r\nascertain whether that body is approaching us or receding from us. Now\r\nthere are certain stars which always appear single even in the largest\r\ntelescopes, but when the spectroscope is directed to them a spectrum\r\n_with two sets of lines_ is seen. Such stars must, therefore, be double.\r\nFurther, if the shiftings of the lines, in a spectrum like this, tell us\r\nthat the component stars are making small movements to and from us which\r\ngo on continuously, we are therefore justified in concluding that these\r\nare the orbital revolutions of a binary system greatly compressed by\r\ndistance. Such connected pairs of stars, since they cannot be seen\r\nseparately by means of any telescope, no matter how large, are known as\r\n\"spectroscopic binaries.\"\r\n\r\nIn observations of spectroscopic binaries we do not always get a double\r\nspectrum. Indeed, if one of the components be below a certain\r\nmagnitude, its spectrum will not appear at all; and so we are left in\r\nthe strange uncertainty as to whether this component is merely faint or\r\nactually dark. It is, however, from the shiftings of the lines in the\r\nspectrum of the other component that we see that an orbital movement is\r\ngoing on, and are thus enabled to conclude that two bodies are here\r\nconnected into a system, although one of these bodies resolutely refuses\r\ndirectly to reveal itself even to the all-conquering spectroscope.\r\n\r\nMizar, that star in the handle of the Plough to which we have already\r\ndrawn attention, will be found with a small telescope to be a fine\r\ndouble, one of the components being white and the other greenish.\r\nActually, however, as the American astronomer, Professor F.R. Moulton,\r\npoints out, these stars are so far from each other that if we could be\r\ntransferred to one of them we should see the other merely as an ordinary\r\nbright star. The spectroscope shows that the brighter of these stars is\r\nagain a binary system of two huge suns, the components revolving around\r\neach other in a period of about twenty days. This discovery made by\r\nProfessor E.C. Pickering, the _first_ of the kind by means of the\r\nspectroscope, was announced in 1889 from the Harvard Observatory in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nA star close to Vega, known as [e] (Epsilon) Lyræ (see Plate XIX., p.\r\n292), is a double, the components of which may be seen separately with\r\nthe naked eye by persons with very keen eyesight. If this star, however,\r\nbe viewed with the telescope, the two companions will be seen far apart;\r\nand it will be noticed that each of them is again a double.\r\n\r\nBy means of the spectroscope Capella is shown to be really composed of\r\ntwo stars (one about twice as bright as the other) situated very close\r\ntogether and forming a binary system. Sirius is also a binary system;\r\nbut it is what is called a \"visual\" one, for its component stars may be\r\n_seen_ separately in very large telescopes. Its double, or rather\r\nbinary, nature, was discovered in 1862 by the celebrated optician Alvan\r\nG. Clark, while in the act of testing the 18-inch refracting telescope,\r\nthen just constructed by his firm, and now at the Dearborn Observatory,\r\nIllinois, U.S.A. The companion is only of the tenth magnitude, and\r\nrevolves around Sirius in a period of about fifty years, at a mean\r\ndistance equal to about that of Uranus from the sun. Seen from Sirius,\r\nit would shine only something like our full moon. It must be\r\nself-luminous and not a mere planet; for Mr. Gore has shown that if it\r\nshone only by the light reflected from Sirius, it would be quite\r\ninvisible even in the Great Yerkes Telescope.\r\n\r\nProcyon is also a binary, its companion having been discovered by\r\nProfessor J.M. Schaeberle at the Lick Observatory in 1896. The period of\r\nrevolution in this system is about forty years. Observations by Mr. T.\r\nLewis of Greenwich seem, however, to point to the companion being a\r\nsmall nebula rather than a star.\r\n\r\nThe star [ê] (Eta) Cassiopeiæ (see Plate XIX., p. 292), is easily seen\r\nas a fine double in telescopes of moderate size. It is a binary system,\r\nthe component bodies revolving around their common centre of gravity in\r\na period of about two hundred years. This system is comparatively near\r\nto us, _i.e._ about nine light years, or a little further off than\r\nSirius.\r\n\r\nIn a small telescope the star Castor will be found double, the\r\ncomponents, one of which is brighter than the other, forming a binary\r\nsystem. The fainter of these was found by Belopolsky, with the\r\nspectroscope, to be composed of a system of two stars, one bright and\r\nthe other either dark or not so bright, revolving around each other in a\r\nperiod of about three days. The brighter component of Castor is also a\r\nspectroscopic binary, with a period of about nine days; so that the\r\nwhole of what we see with the naked eye as Castor, is in reality a\r\nremarkable system of four stars in mutual orbital movement.\r\n\r\nAlpha Centauri--the nearest star to the earth--is a visual binary, the\r\ncomponent bodies revolving around each other in a period of about\r\neighty-one years. The extent of this system is about the same as that of\r\nSirius. Viewed from each other, the bodies would shine only like our sun\r\nas seen from Neptune.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous binary stars the orbits of some fifty have been\r\nsatisfactorily determined. Many double stars, for which this has not yet\r\nbeen done, are, however, believed to be, without doubt, binary. In some\r\ncases a parallax has been found; so that we are enabled to estimate in\r\nmiles the actual extent of such systems, and the masses of the bodies in\r\nterms of the sun's mass.\r\n\r\nMost of the spectroscopic binaries appear to be upon a smaller scale\r\nthan the telescopic ones. Some are, indeed, comparatively speaking,\r\nquite small. For instance, the component stars forming [b] Aurigæ are\r\nabout eight million miles apart, while in [z] Geminorum, the distance\r\nbetween the bodies is only a little more than a million miles.\r\n\r\nSpectroscopic binaries are probably very numerous. Professor W.W.\r\nCampbell, Director of the Lick Observatory, estimates, for instance,\r\nthat, out of about every half-a-dozen stars, one is a spectroscopic\r\nbinary.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the case of binary systems that we can discover the masses\r\nof stars at all. These are ascertained from their movements with regard\r\nto each other under the influence of their mutual gravitative\r\nattractions. In the case of simple stars we have clearly nothing of the\r\nkind to judge by; though, if we can obtain a parallax, we may hazard a\r\nguess from their brightness.\r\n\r\nBinary stars were incidentally discovered by Sir William Herschel. In\r\nhis researches to get a stellar parallax he had selected a number of\r\ndouble stars for test purposes, on the assumption that, if one of such a\r\npair were much nearer than the other, it might show a displacement with\r\nregard to its neighbour as a direct consequence of the earth's orbital\r\nmovement around the sun. He, however, failed entirely to obtain any\r\nparallaxes, the triumph in this being, as we have seen, reserved for\r\nBessel. But in some of the double stars which he had selected, he found\r\ncertain alterations in the relative positions of the bodies, which\r\nplainly were not a consequence of the earth's motion, but showed rather\r\nthat there was an actual circling movement of the bodies themselves\r\nunder their mutual attractions. It is to be noted that the existence of\r\nsuch connected pairs had been foretold as probable by the Rev. John\r\nMichell, who lived a short time before Herschel.\r\n\r\nThe researches into binary systems--both those which can be seen with\r\nthe eye and those which can be observed by means of the spectroscope,\r\nought to impress upon us very forcibly the wide sway of the law of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nOf star clusters about 100 are known, and such systems often contain\r\nseveral thousand stars. They usually cover an area of sky somewhat\r\nsmaller than the moon appears to fill. In most clusters the stars are\r\nvery faint, and, as a rule, are between the twelfth and sixteenth\r\nmagnitudes. It is difficult to say whether these are actually small\r\nbodies, or whether their faintness is due merely to their great distance\r\nfrom us, since they are much too far off to show any appreciable\r\nparallactic displacement. Mr. Gore, however, thinks there is good\r\nevidence to show that the stars in clusters are really close, and that\r\nthe clusters themselves fill a comparatively small space.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest examples of a cluster is the great globular one, in\r\nthe constellation of Hercules, discovered by Halley in 1714. It contains\r\nover 5000 stars, and upon a clear, dark night is visible to the naked\r\neye as a patch of light. In the telescope, however, it is a wonderful\r\nobject. There are also fine clusters in the constellations of Auriga,\r\nPegasus, and Canes Venatici. In the southern heavens there are some\r\nmagnificent examples of globular clusters. This hemisphere seems,\r\nindeed, to be richer in such objects than the northern. For instance,\r\nthere is a great one in the constellation of the Centaur, containing\r\nsome 6000 stars (see Plate XXI., p. 306).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI. THE GREAT GLOBULAR CLUSTER IN THE SOUTHERN\r\nCONSTELLATION OF CENTAURUS\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken at the Cape Observatory, on May 24th, 1903. Time\r\nof exposure, 1 hour.\r\n\r\n(Page 306)]\r\n\r\nCertain remarkable groups of stars, of a nature similar to clusters,\r\nthough not containing such faint or densely packed stars as those we\r\nhave just alluded to, call for a mention in this connection. The best\r\nexample of such star groups are the Pleiades and the Hyades (see Plate\r\nXX., p. 296), Coma Berenices, and Præsepe (or the Beehive), the\r\nlast-named being in the constellation of Cancer.\r\n\r\nStars which alter in their brightness are called _Variable Stars_, or\r\n\"variables.\" The first star whose variability attracted attention is\r\nthat known as Omicron Ceti, namely, the star marked with the Greek\r\nletter [o] (Omicron) in the constellation of Cetus, or the Whale, a\r\nconstellation situated not far from Taurus. This star, the variability\r\nof which was discovered by Fabricius in 1596, is also known as Mira, or\r\nthe \"Wonderful,\" on account of the extraordinary manner in which its\r\nlight varies from time to time. The star known by the name of Algol,[32]\r\npopularly called the \"Demon Star\"--whose astronomical designation is [b]\r\n(Beta) Persei, or the star second in brightness in the constellation of\r\nPerseus--was discovered by Goodricke, in the year 1783, to be a variable\r\nstar. In the following year [b] Lyræ, the star in Lyra next in order of\r\nbrightness after Vega, was also found by the same observer to be a\r\nvariable. It may be of interest to the reader to know that Goodricke was\r\ndeaf and dumb, and that he died in 1786 at the early age of twenty-one\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the close of the nineteenth century that much\r\nattention was paid to variable stars. Now several hundreds of these are\r\nknown, thanks chiefly to the observations of, amongst others, Professor\r\nS.C. Chandler of Boston, U.S.A., Mr. John Ellard Gore of Dublin, and Dr.\r\nA.W. Roberts of South Africa. This branch of astronomy has not, indeed,\r\nattracted as much popular attention as it deserves, no doubt because the\r\nnature of the work required does not call for the glamour of an\r\nobservatory or a large telescope.\r\n\r\nThe chief discoveries with regard to variable stars have been made by\r\nthe naked eye, or with a small binocular. The amount of variation is\r\nestimated by a comparison with other stars. As in many other branches of\r\nastronomy, photography is now employed in this quest with marked\r\nsuccess; and lately many variable stars have been found to exist in\r\nclusters and nebulæ.\r\n\r\nIt was at one time considered that a variable star was in all\r\nprobability a body, a portion of whose surface had been relatively\r\ndarkened in some manner akin to that in which sun spots mar the face of\r\nthe sun; and that when its axial rotation brought the less illuminated\r\nportions in turn towards us, we witnessed a consequent diminution in the\r\nstar's general brightness. Herschel, indeed, inclined to this\r\nexplanation, for his belief was that all the stars bore spots like those\r\nof the sun. It appears preferably thought nowadays that disturbances\r\ntake place periodically in the atmosphere or surroundings of certain\r\nstars, perhaps through the escape of imprisoned gases, and that this may\r\nbe a fruitful cause of changes of brilliancy. The theory in question\r\nwill, however, apparently account for only one class of variable star,\r\nnamely, that of which Mira Ceti is the best-known example. The scale on\r\nwhich it varies in brightness is very great, for it changes from the\r\nsecond to the ninth magnitude. For the other leading type of variable\r\nstar, Algol, of which mention has already been made, is the best\r\ninstance. The shortness of the period in which the changes of brightness\r\nin such stars go their round, is the chief characteristic of this latter\r\nclass. The period of Algol is a little under three days. This star when\r\nat its brightest is of about the second magnitude, and when least bright\r\nis reduced to below the third magnitude; from which it follows that its\r\nlight, when at the minimum, is only about one-third of what it is when\r\nat the maximum. It seems definitely proved by means of the spectroscope\r\nthat variables of this kind are merely binary stars, too close to be\r\nseparated by the telescope, which, as a consequence of their orbits\r\nchancing to be edgewise towards us, eclipse each other in turn time\r\nafter time. If, for instance, both components of such a pair are bright,\r\nthen when one of them is right behind the other, we will not, of course,\r\nget the same amount of light as when they are side by side. If, on the\r\nother hand, one of the components happens to be dark or less luminous\r\nand the other bright, the manner in which the light of the bright star\r\nwill be diminished when the darker star crosses its face should easily\r\nbe understood. It is to the second of these types that Algol is supposed\r\nto belong. The Algol system appears to be composed of a body about as\r\nbroad as our sun, which regularly eclipses a brighter body which has a\r\ndiameter about half as great again.\r\n\r\nSince the companion of Algol is often spoken of as a _dark_ body, it\r\nwere well here to point out that we have no evidence at all that it is\r\nentirely devoid of light. We have already found, in dealing with\r\nspectroscopic binaries, that when one of the component stars is below a\r\ncertain magnitude[33] its spectrum will not be seen; so one is left in\r\nthe glorious uncertainty as to whether the body in question is\r\nabsolutely dark, or darkish, or faint, or indeed only just out of range\r\nof the spectroscope.\r\n\r\nIt is thought probable by good authorities that the companion of Algol\r\nis not quite dark, but has some inherent light of its own. It is, of\r\ncourse, much too near Algol to be seen with the largest telescope. There\r\nis in fact a distance of only from two to three millions of miles\r\nbetween the bodies, from which Mr. Gore infers that they would probably\r\nremain unseparated even in the largest telescope which could ever be\r\nconstructed by man.\r\n\r\nThe number of known variables of the Algol type is, so far, small; not\r\nmuch indeed over thirty. In some of them the components are believed to\r\nrevolve touching each other, or nearly so. An extreme example of this is\r\nfound in the remarkable star V. Puppis, an Algol variable of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. Both its components are bright, and the period of\r\nlight variation is about one and a half days. Dr. A. W. Roberts finds\r\nthat the bodies are revolving around each other in actual contact.\r\n\r\n_Temporary stars_ are stars which have suddenly blazed out in regions of\r\nthe sky where no star was previously seen, and have faded away more or\r\nless gradually.\r\n\r\nIt was the appearance of such a star, in the year 134 B.C., which\r\nprompted Hipparchus to make his celebrated catalogue, with the object of\r\nleaving a record by which future observers could note celestial changes.\r\nIn 1572 another star of this kind flashed out in the constellation of\r\nCassiopeia (see Plate XIX., p. 292), and was detected by Tycho Brahe. It\r\nbecame as bright as the planet Venus, and eventually was visible in the\r\nday-time. Two years later, however, it disappeared, and has never since\r\nbeen seen. In 1604 Kepler recorded a similar star in the constellation\r\nof Ophiuchus which grew to be as bright as Jupiter. It also lasted for\r\nabout two years, and then faded away, leaving no trace behind. It is\r\nrarely, however, that temporary stars attain to such a brilliance; and\r\nso possibly in former times a number of them may have appeared, but not\r\nhave risen to a sufficient magnitude to attract attention. Even now,\r\nunless such a star becomes clearly visible to the naked eye, it runs a\r\ngood chance of not being detected. A curious point, worth noting, with\r\nregard to temporary stars is that the majority of them have appeared in\r\nthe Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThese sudden visitations have in our day received the name of _Novæ_;\r\nthat is to say, \"New\" Stars. Two, in recent years, attracted a good deal\r\nof attention. The first of these, known as Nova Aurigæ, or the New Star\r\nin the constellation of Auriga, was discovered by Dr. T.D. Anderson at\r\nEdinburgh in January 1892. At its greatest brightness it attained to\r\nabout the fourth magnitude. By April it had sunk to the twelfth, but\r\nduring August it recovered to the ninth magnitude. After this last\r\nflare-up it gradually faded away.\r\n\r\nThe startling suddenness with which temporary stars usually spring into\r\nbeing is the groundwork upon which theories to account for their origin\r\nhave been erected. That numbers of dark stars, extinguished suns, so to\r\nspeak, may exist in space, there is a strong suspicion; and it is just\r\npossible that we have an instance of one dark stellar body in the\r\ncompanion of Algol. That such dark stars might be in rapid motion is\r\nreasonable to assume from the already known movements of bright stars.\r\nTwo dark bodies might, indeed, collide together, or a collision might\r\ntake place between a dark star and a star too faint to be seen even with\r\nthe most powerful telescope. The conflagration produced by the impact\r\nwould thus appear where nothing had been seen previously. Again, a\r\nsimilar effect might be produced by a dark body, or a star too faint to\r\nbe seen, being heated to incandescence by plunging in its course through\r\na nebulous mass of matter, of which there are many examples lying about\r\nin space.\r\n\r\nThe last explanation, which is strongly reminiscent of what takes place\r\nin shooting stars, appears more probable than the collision theory. The\r\nflare-up of new stars continues, indeed, only for a comparatively short\r\ntime; whereas a collision between two bodies would, on the other hand,\r\nproduce an enormous nebula which might take even millions of years to\r\ncool down. We have, indeed, no record of any such sudden appearance of a\r\nlasting nebula.\r\n\r\nThe other temporary star, known as Nova Persei, or the new star in the\r\nconstellation of Perseus, was discovered early in the morning of\r\nFebruary 22, 1901, also by Dr. Anderson. A day later it had grown to be\r\nbrighter than Capella. Photographs which had been taken, some three days\r\nprevious to its discovery, of the very region of the sky in which it had\r\nburst forth, were carefully examined, and it was not found in these. At\r\nthe end of two days after its discovery Nova Persei had lost one-third\r\nof its light. During the ensuing six months it passed through a series\r\nof remarkable fluctuations, varying in brightness between the third and\r\nfifth magnitudes. In the month of August it was seen to be surrounded by\r\nluminous matter in the form of a nebula, which appeared to be gradually\r\nspreading to some distance around. Taking into consideration the great\r\nway off at which all this was taking place, it looked as if the new star\r\nhad ejected matter which was travelling outward with a velocity\r\nequivalent to that of light. The remarkable theory was, however, put\r\nforward by Professor Kapteyn and the late Dr. W.E. Wilson that there\r\nmight be after all no actual transmission of matter; but that perhaps\r\nthe real explanation was the gradual _illumination_ of hitherto\r\ninvisible nebulous matter, as a consequence of the flare-up which had\r\ntaken place about six months before. It was, therefore, imagined that\r\nsome dark body moving through space at a very rapid rate had plunged\r\nthrough a mass of invisible nebulous matter, and had consequently become\r\nheated to incandescence in its passage, very much like what happens to a\r\nmeteor when moving through our atmosphere. The illumination thus set up\r\ntemporarily in one point, being transmitted through the nebulous wastes\r\naround with the ordinary velocity of light, had gradually rendered this\r\nsurrounding matter visible. On the assumptions required to fit in with\r\nsuch a theory, it was shown that Nova Persei must be at a distance from\r\nwhich light would take about three hundred years in coming to us. The\r\nactual outburst of illumination, which gave rise to this temporary star,\r\nwould therefore have taken place about the beginning of the reign of\r\nJames I.\r\n\r\nSome recent investigations with regard to Nova Persei have, however,\r\ngreatly narrowed down the above estimate of its distance from us. For\r\ninstance, Bergstrand proposes a distance of about ninety-nine light\r\nyears; while the conclusions of Mr. F.W. Very would bring it still\r\nnearer, _i.e._ about sixty-five light years.\r\n\r\nThe last celestial objects with which we have here to deal are the\r\n_Nebulæ_. These are masses of diffused shining matter scattered here and\r\nthere through the depths of space. Nebulæ are of several kinds, and have\r\nbeen classified under the various headings of Spiral, Planetary, Ring,\r\nand Irregular.\r\n\r\nA typical _spiral_ nebula is composed of a disc-shaped central portion,\r\nwith long curved arms projecting from opposite sides of it, which give\r\nan impression of rapid rotatory movement.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of spiral nebulæ was made by Lord Rosse with his great\r\n6-foot reflector. Two good examples of these objects will be found in\r\nUrsa Major, while there is another fine one in Canes Venatici (see Plate\r\nXXII., p. 314), a constellation which lies between Ursa Major and\r\nBoötes. But the finest spiral of all, perhaps the most remarkable nebula\r\nknown to us, is the Great Nebula in the constellation of Andromeda, (see\r\nPlate XXIII., p. 316)--a constellation just further from the pole than\r\nCassiopeia. When the moon is absent and the night clear this nebula can\r\nbe easily seen with the naked eye as a small patch of hazy light. It is\r\nreferred to by Al Sufi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII. SPIRAL NEBULA IN THE CONSTELLATION OF CANES\r\nVENATICI\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by the late Dr. W.E. Wilson, D.Sc., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n(Page 314)]\r\n\r\nSpiral nebulæ are white in colour, whereas the other kinds of nebula\r\nhave a greenish tinge. They are also by far the most numerous; and the\r\nlate Professor Keeler, who considered this the normal type of nebula,\r\nestimated that there were at least 120,000 of such spirals within the\r\nreach of the Crossley reflector of the Lick Observatory. Professor\r\nPerrine has indeed lately raised this estimate to half a million, and\r\nthinks that with more sensitive photographic plates and longer exposures\r\nthe number of spirals would exceed a million. The majority of these\r\nobjects are very small, and appear to be distributed over the sky in a\r\nfairly uniform manner.\r\n\r\n_Planetary_ nebulæ are small faint roundish objects which, when seen in\r\nthe telescope, recall the appearance of a planet, hence their name. One\r\nof these nebulæ, known astronomically as G.C. 4373, has recently been\r\nfound to be rushing through space towards the earth at a rate of between\r\nthirty and forty miles per second. It seems strange, indeed, that any\r\ngaseous mass should move at such a speed!\r\n\r\nWhat are known as _ring_ nebulæ were until recently believed to form a\r\nspecial class. These objects have the appearance of mere rings of\r\nnebulous matter. Much doubt has, however, been thrown upon their being\r\nrings at all; and the best authorities regard them merely as spiral\r\nnebulæ, of which we happen to get a foreshortened view. Very few\r\nexamples are known, the most famous being one in the constellation of\r\nLyra, usually known as the Annular Nebula in Lyra. This object is so\r\nremote from us as to be entirely invisible to the naked eye. It contains\r\na star of the fifteenth magnitude near to its centre. From photographs\r\ntaken with the Crossley reflector, Professor Schaeberle finds in this\r\nnebula evidences of spiral structure. It may here be mentioned that the\r\nGreat Nebula in Andromeda, which has now turned out to be a spiral, had\r\nin earlier photographs the appearance of a ring.\r\n\r\nThere also exist nebulæ of _irregular_ form, the most notable being the\r\nGreat Nebula in the constellation of Orion (see Plate XXIV., p. 318). It\r\nis situated in the centre of the \"Sword\" of Orion (see Plate XX., p.\r\n296). In large telescopes it appears as a magnificent object, and in\r\nactual dimensions it must be much on the same scale as the Andromeda\r\nNebula. The spectroscope tells us that it is a mass of glowing gas.\r\n\r\nThe Trifid Nebula, situated in the constellation of Sagittarius, is an\r\nobject of very strange shape. Three dark clefts radiate from its centre,\r\ngiving it an appearance as if it had been torn into shreds.\r\n\r\nThe Dumb-bell Nebula, a celebrated object, so called from its likeness\r\nto a dumb-bell, turns out, from recent photographs taken by Professor\r\nSchaeberle, which bring additional detail into view, to be after all a\r\ngreat spiral.\r\n\r\nThere is a nest, or rather a cluster of nebulæ in the constellation of\r\nComa Berenices; over a hundred of these objects being here gathered into\r\na space of sky about the size of our full moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII. THE GREAT NEBULA IN THE CONSTELLATION OF\r\nANDROMEDA\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken at the Yerkes Observatory.\r\n\r\n(Page 314)]\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope informs us that spiral nebulæ are composed of\r\npartially-cooled matter. Their colour, as we have seen, is white. Nebulæ\r\nof a greenish tint are, on the other hand, found to be entirely in a\r\ngaseous condition. Just as the solar corona contains an unknown element,\r\nwhich for the time being has been called \"Coronium,\" so do the gaseous\r\nnebulæ give evidence of the presence of another unknown element. To this\r\nSir William Huggins has given the provisional name of \"Nebulium.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Magellanic Clouds_ are two patches of nebulous-looking light, more\r\nor less circular in form, which are situated in the southern hemisphere\r\nof the sky. They bear a certain resemblance to portions of the Milky\r\nWay, but are, however, not connected with it. They have received their\r\nname from the celebrated navigator, Magellan, who seems to have been one\r\nof the first persons to draw attention to them. \"Nubeculæ\" is another\r\nname by which they are known, the larger cloud being styled _nubecula\r\nmajor_ and the smaller one _nubecula minor_. They contain within them\r\nstars, clusters, and gaseous nebulæ. No parallax has yet been found for\r\nany object which forms part of the nubeculæ, so it is very difficult to\r\nestimate at what distance from us they may lie. They are, however,\r\nconsidered to be well within our stellar universe.\r\n\r\nHaving thus brought to a conclusion our all too brief review of the\r\nstars and the nebulæ--of the leading objects in fine which the celestial\r\nspaces have revealed to man--we will close this chapter with a recent\r\nsummation by Sir David Gill of the relations which appear to obtain\r\nbetween these various bodies. \"Huggins's spectroscope,\" he says, \"has\r\nshown that many nebulæ are not stars at all; that many well-condensed\r\nnebulæ, as well as vast patches of nebulous light in the sky, are but\r\ninchoate masses of luminous gas. Evidence upon evidence has accumulated\r\nto show that such nebulæ consist of the matter out of which stars\r\n(_i.e._ suns) have been and are being evolved. The different types of\r\nstar spectra form such a complete and gradual sequence (from simple\r\nspectra resembling those of nebulæ onwards through types of gradually\r\nincreasing complexity) as to suggest that we have before us, written in\r\nthe cryptograms of these spectra, the complete story of the evolution of\r\nsuns from the inchoate nebula onwards to the most active sun (like our\r\nown), and then downward to the almost heatless and invisible ball. The\r\nperiod during which human life has existed upon our globe is probably\r\ntoo short--even if our first parents had begun the work--to afford\r\nobservational proof of such a cycle of change in any particular star;\r\nbut the fact of such evolution, with the evidence before us, can hardly\r\nbe doubted.\"[34]\r\n\r\n[32] The name Al gûl, meaning the Demon, was what the old Arabian\r\nastronomers called it, which looks very much as if they had already\r\nnoticed its rapid fluctuations in brightness.\r\n\r\n[33] Mr. Gore thinks that the companion of Algol may be a star of the\r\nsixth magnitude.\r\n\r\n[34] Presidential Address to the British Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science (Leicester, 1907), by Sir David Gill, K.C.B., LL.D., F.R.S.,\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV. THE GREAT NEBULA IN THE CONSTELLATION OF\r\nORION\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken at the Yerkes Observatory.\r\n\r\n(Page 316)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE STELLAR UNIVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars appear fairly evenly distributed all around us, except in one\r\nportion of the sky where they seem very crowded, and so give one an\r\nimpression of being very distant. This portion, known as the Milky Way,\r\nstretches, as we have already said, in the form of a broad band right\r\nround the entire heavens. In those regions of the sky most distant from\r\nthe Milky Way the stars appear to be thinly sown, but become more and\r\nmore closely massed together as the Milky Way is approached.\r\n\r\nThis apparent distribution of the stars in space has given rise to a\r\ntheory which was much favoured by Sir William Herschel, and which is\r\nusually credited to him, although it was really suggested by one Thomas\r\nWright of Durham in 1750; that is to say, some thirty years or more\r\nbefore Herschel propounded it. According to this, which is known as the\r\n\"Disc\" or \"Grindstone\" Theory, the stars are considered as arranged in\r\nspace somewhat in the form of a thick disc, or grindstone, close to the\r\n_central_ parts of which our solar system is situated.[35] Thus we\r\nshould see a greater number of stars when we looked out through the\r\n_length_ of such a disc in any direction, than when we looked out\r\nthrough its _breadth_. This theory was, for a time, supposed to account\r\nquite reasonably for the Milky Way, and for the gradual increase in the\r\nnumber of stars in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to verify directly such a theory, for we know the\r\nactual distance of only about forty-three stars. We are unable,\r\ntherefore, definitely to assure ourselves whether, as the grindstone\r\ntheory presupposes, the stellar universe actually reaches out very much\r\nfurther from us in the direction of the Milky Way than in the other\r\nparts of the sky. The theory is clearly founded upon the supposition\r\nthat the stars are more or less equal in size, and are scattered through\r\nspace at fairly regular distances from each other.\r\n\r\nBrightness, therefore, had been taken as implying nearness to us, and\r\nfaintness great distance. But we know to-day that this is not the case,\r\nand that the stars around us are, on the other hand, of various degrees\r\nof brightness and of all orders of size. Some of the faint stars--for\r\ninstance, the galloping star in Pictor--are indeed nearer to us than\r\nmany of the brighter ones. Sirius, on the other hand, is twice as far\r\noff from us as [a] Centauri, and yet it is very much brighter; while\r\nCanopus, which in brightness is second only to Sirius out of the whole\r\nsky, is too far off for its distance to be ascertained! It must be\r\nremembered that no parallax had yet been found for any star in the days\r\nof Herschel, and so his estimations of stellar distances were\r\nnecessarily of a very circumstantial kind. He did not, however, continue\r\nalways to build upon such uncertain ground; but, after some further\r\nexamination of the Milky Way, he gave up his idea that the stars were\r\nequally disposed in space, and eventually abandoned the grindstone\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nSince we have no means of satisfactorily testing the matter, through\r\nfinding out the various distances from us at which the stars are really\r\nplaced, one might just as well go to the other extreme, and assume that\r\nthe thickening of stars in the region of the Milky Way is not an effect\r\nof perspective at all, but that the stars in that part of the sky are\r\nactually more crowded together than elsewhere--a thing which astronomers\r\nnow believe to be the case. Looked at in this way, the shape of the\r\nstellar universe might be that of a globe-shaped aggregation of stars,\r\nin which the individuals are set at fairly regular distances from each\r\nother; the whole being closely encircled by a belt of densely packed\r\nstars. It must, however, be allowed that the gradual increase in the\r\nnumber of stars towards the Milky Way appears a strong argument in\r\nfavour of the grindstone theory; yet the belt theory, as above detailed,\r\nseems to meet with more acceptance.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, one marked circumstance which is remarkably difficult\r\nof explanation by means of the grindstone theory. This is the existence\r\nof vacant spaces--holes, so to speak, in the groundwork of the Milky\r\nWay. For instance, there is a cleft running for a good distance along\r\nits length, and there is also a starless gap in its southern portion. It\r\nseems rather improbable that such a great number of stars could have\r\narranged themselves so conveniently, as to give us a clear view right\r\nout into empty space through such a system in its greatest thickness;\r\nas if, in fact, holes had been bored, and clefts made, from the boundary\r\nof the disc clean up to where our solar system lies. Sir John Herschel\r\nlong ago drew attention to this point very forcibly. It is plain that\r\nsuch vacant spaces can, on the other hand, be more simply explained as\r\nmere holes in a belt; and the best authorities maintain that the\r\nappearance of the Milky Way confirms a view of this kind.\r\n\r\nWhichever theory be indeed the correct one, it appears at any rate that\r\nthe stars do not stretch out in every direction to an infinite distance;\r\nbut that _the stellar system is of limited extent_, and has in fact a\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Science has no grounds for supposing that light is\r\nin any way absorbed or destroyed merely by its passage through the\r\n\"ether,\" that imponderable medium which is believed to transmit the\r\nluminous radiations through space. This of course is tantamount to\r\nsaying that all the direct light from all the stars should reach us,\r\nexcepting that little which is absorbed in its passage through our own\r\natmosphere. If stars, and stars, and stars existed in every direction\r\noutwards without end, it can be proved mathematically that in such\r\ncircumstances there could not remain the tiniest space in the sky\r\nwithout a star to fill it, and that therefore the heavens would always\r\nblaze with light, and the night would be as bright as the noonday.[36]\r\nHow very far indeed this is from being the case, may be gathered from an\r\nestimate which has been made of the general amount of light which we\r\nreceive from the stars. According to this estimate the sky is considered\r\nas more or less dark, the combined illumination sent to us by all the\r\nstars being only about the one-hundreth part of what we get from the\r\nfull moon.[37]\r\n\r\nSecondly, it has been suggested that although light may not suffer any\r\nextinction or diminution from the ether itself, still a great deal of\r\nillumination may be prevented from reaching us through myriads of\r\nextinguished suns, or dark meteoric matter lying about in space. The\r\nidea of such extinguished suns, dark stars in fact, seems however to be\r\nmerely founded upon the sole instance of the invisible companion of\r\nAlgol; but, as we have seen, there is no proof whatever that it is a\r\ndark body. Again, some astronomers have thought that the dark holes in\r\nthe Milky Way, \"Coal Sacks,\" as they are called, are due to masses of\r\ncool, or partially cooled matter, which cuts off the light of the stars\r\nbeyond. The most remarkable of these holes is one in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Southern Cross, known as the \"Coal Sack in Crux.\" But Mr. Gore\r\nthinks that the cause of the holes is to be sought for rather in what\r\nSir William Herschel termed \"clustering power,\" _i.e._ a tendency on the\r\npart of stars to accumulate in certain places, thus leaving others\r\nvacant; and the fact that globular and other clusters are to be found\r\nvery near to such holes certainly seems corroborative of this theory. In\r\nsumming up the whole question, Professor Newcomb maintains that there\r\ndoes not appear any evidence of the light from the Milky Way stars,\r\nwhich are apparently the furthest bodies we see, being intercepted by\r\ndark bodies or dark matter. As far as our telescopes can penetrate, he\r\nholds that we see the stars _just as they are_.\r\n\r\nAlso, if there did exist an infinite number of stars, one would expect\r\nto find evidence in some direction of an overpoweringly great\r\nforce,--the centre of gravity of all these bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is noticed, too, that although the stars increase in number with\r\ndecrease in magnitude, so that as we descend in the scale we find three\r\ntimes as many stars in each magnitude as in the one immediately above\r\nit, yet this progression does not go on after a while. There is, in\r\nfact, a rapid falling off in numbers below the twelfth magnitude; which\r\nlooks as if, at a certain distance from us, the stellar universe were\r\nbeginning to _thin out_.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is estimated, by Mr. Gore and others, that only about 100\r\nmillions of stars are to be seen in the whole of the sky with the best\r\noptical aids. This shows well the limited extent of the stellar system,\r\nfor the number is not really great. For instance, there are from fifteen\r\nto sixteen times as many persons alive upon the earth at this moment!\r\n\r\nLast of all, there appears to be strong photographic evidence that our\r\nsidereal system is limited in extent. Two photographs taken by the late\r\nDr. Isaac Roberts of a region rich in stellar objects in the\r\nconstellation of Cygnus, clearly show what has been so eloquently called\r\nthe \"darkness behind the stars.\" One of these photographs was taken in\r\n1895, and the other in 1898. On both occasions the state of the\r\natmosphere was practically the same, and the sensitiveness of the films\r\nwas of the same degree. The exposure in the first case was only one\r\nhour; in the second it was about two hours and a half. And yet both\r\nphotographs show _exactly the same stars, even down to the faintest_.\r\nFrom this one would gather that the region in question, which is one of\r\nthe most thickly star-strewn in the Milky Way, is _penetrable right\r\nthrough_ with the means at our command. Dr. Roberts himself in\r\ncommenting upon the matter drew attention to the fact, that many\r\nastronomers seemed to have tacitly adopted the assumption that the stars\r\nextend indefinitely through space.\r\n\r\nFrom considerations such as these the foremost astronomical authorities\r\nof our time consider themselves justified in believing that the\r\ncollection of stars around us is _finite_; and that although our best\r\ntelescopes may not yet be powerful enough to penetrate to the final\r\nstars, still the rapid decrease in numbers as space is sounded with\r\nincreasing telescopic power, points strongly to the conclusion that the\r\nboundaries of the stellar system may not lie very far beyond the\r\nuttermost to which we can at present see.\r\n\r\nIs it possible then to make an estimate of the extent of this stellar\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\nWhatever estimates we may attempt to form cannot however be regarded as\r\nat all exact, for we know the actual distances of such a very few only\r\nof the nearest of the stars. But our knowledge of the distances even of\r\nthese few, permits us to assume that the stars close around us may be\r\nsituated, on an average, at about eight light-years from each other; and\r\nthat this holds good of the stellar spaces, with the exception of the\r\nencircling girdle of the Milky Way, where the stars seem actually to be\r\nmore closely packed together. This girdle further appears to contain the\r\ngreater number of the stars. Arguing along these lines, Professor\r\nNewcomb reaches the conclusion that the farthest stellar bodies which we\r\nsee are situated at about between 3000 and 4000 light-years from us.\r\n\r\nStarting our inquiry from another direction, we can try to form an\r\nestimate by considering the question of proper motions.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that such motions do not depend entirely upon the\r\nactual speed of the stars themselves, but that some of the apparent\r\nmovement arises indirectly from the speed of our own sun. The part in a\r\nproper motion which can be ascribed to the movement of our solar system\r\nthrough space is clearly a displacement in the nature of a parallax--Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel called it \"_Systematic_ Parallax\"; so that knowing the\r\ndistance which we move over in a certain lapse of time, we are able to\r\nhazard a guess at the distances of a good many of the stars. An inquiry\r\nupon such lines must needs be very rough, and is plainly based upon the\r\nassumption that the stars whose distances we attempt to estimate are\r\nmoving at an average speed much like that of our own sun, and that they\r\nare not \"runaway stars\" of the 1830 Groombridge order. Be that as it\r\nmay, the results arrived at by Professor Newcomb from this method of\r\nreasoning are curiously enough very much on a par with those founded on\r\nthe few parallaxes which we are really certain about; with the exception\r\nthat they point to somewhat closer intervals between the individual\r\nstars, and so tend to narrow down our previous estimate of the extent of\r\nthe stellar system.\r\n\r\nThus far we get, and no farther. Our solar system appears to lie\r\nsomewhere near the centre of a great collection of stars, separated each\r\none from the other, on an average, by some 40 billions of miles; the\r\nwhole being arranged in the form of a mighty globular cluster. Light\r\nfrom the nearest of these stars takes some four years to come to us. It\r\ntakes about 1000 times as long to reach us from the confines of the\r\nsystem. This globe of stars is wrapt around closely by a stellar girdle,\r\nthe individual stars in which are set together more densely than those\r\nin the globe itself. The entire arrangement appears to be constructed\r\nupon a very regular plan. Here and there, as Professor Newcomb points\r\nout, the aspect of the heavens differs in small detail; but generally it\r\nmay be laid down that the opposite portions of the sky, whether in the\r\nMilky Way itself, or in those regions distant from it, show a marked\r\ndegree of symmetry. The proper motions of stars in corresponding\r\nportions of the sky reveal the same kind of harmony, a harmony which may\r\neven be extended to the various colours of the stars. The stellar\r\nsystem, which we see disposed all around us, appears in fine to bear all\r\nthe marks of an _organised whole_.\r\n\r\nThe older astronomers, to take Sir William Herschel as an example,\r\nsupposed some of the nebulæ to be distant \"universes.\" Sir William was\r\nled to this conclusion by the idea he had formed that, when his\r\ntelescopes failed to show the separate stars of which he imagined these\r\nobjects to be composed, he must put down the failure to their stupendous\r\ndistance from us. For instance, he thought the Orion Nebula, which is\r\nnow known to be made up of glowing gas, to be an external stellar\r\nsystem. Later on, however, he changed his mind upon this point, and came\r\nto the conclusion that \"shining fluid\" would better account both for\r\nthis nebula, and for others which his telescopes had failed to separate\r\ninto component stars.\r\n\r\nThe old ideas with regard to external systems and distant universes have\r\nbeen shelved as a consequence of recent research. All known clusters and\r\nnebulæ are now firmly believed to lie _within_ our stellar system.\r\n\r\nThis view of the universe of stars as a sort of island in the\r\nimmensities, does not, however, give us the least idea about the actual\r\nextent of space itself. Whether what is called space is really infinite,\r\nthat is to say, stretches out unendingly in every direction, or whether\r\nit has eventually a boundary somewhere, are alike questions which the\r\nhuman mind seems utterly unable to picture to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n[35] The Ptolemaic idea dies hard!\r\n\r\n[36] Even the Milky Way itself is far from being a blaze of light, which\r\nshows that the stars composing it do not extend outwards indefinitely.\r\n\r\n[37] Mr. Gore has recently made some remarkable deductions, with regard\r\nto the amount of light which we get from the stars. He considers that\r\nmost of this light comes from stars below the sixth magnitude; and\r\nconsequently, if all the stars visible to the naked eye were to be\r\nblotted out, the glow of the night sky would remain practically the same\r\nas it is at present. Going to the other end of the scale, he thinks also\r\nthat the combined light which we get from all the stars below the\r\nseventeenth magnitude is so very small, that it may be neglected in such\r\nan estimation. He finds, indeed, that if there are stars so low as the\r\ntwentieth magnitude, one hundred millions of them would only be equal in\r\nbrightness to a single first-magnitude star like Vega. On the other\r\nhand, it is possible that the light of the sky at night is not entirely\r\ndue to starlight, but that some of it may be caused by phosphorescent\r\nglow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE STELLAR UNIVERSE--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to consider the proper motions of stars with\r\nreference to such an isolated stellar system as has been pictured in the\r\nprevious chapter. These proper motions are so minute as a rule, that we\r\nare quite unable to determine whether the stars which show them are\r\nmoving along in straight lines, or in orbits of immense extent. It\r\nwould, in fact, take thousands of years of careful observation to\r\ndetermine whether the paths in question showed any degree of curving. In\r\nthe case of the more distant stars, the accurate observations which have\r\nbeen conducted during the last hundred years have not so far revealed\r\nany proper motions with regard to them; but one cannot escape the\r\nconclusion that these stars move as the others do.\r\n\r\nIf space outside our stellar system is infinite in extent, and if all\r\nthe stars within that system are moving unchecked in every conceivable\r\ndirection, the result must happen that after immense ages these stars\r\nwill have drawn apart to such a distance from each other, that the\r\nsystem will have entirely disintegrated, and will cease to exist as a\r\nconnected whole. Eventually, indeed, as Professor Newcomb points out,\r\nthe stars will have separated so far from each other that each will be\r\nleft by itself in the midst of a black and starless sky. If, however, a\r\ncertain proportion of stars have a speed sufficiently slow, they will\r\ntend under mutual attraction to be brought to rest by collisions, or\r\nforced to move in orbits around each other. But those stars which move\r\nat excessive speeds, such, for instance, as 1830 Groombridge, or the\r\nstar in the southern constellation of Pictor, seem utterly incapable of\r\nbeing held back in their courses by even the entire gravitative force of\r\nour stellar system acting as a whole. These stars must, therefore, move\r\neventually right through the system and pass out again into the empty\r\nspaces beyond. Add to this; certain investigations, made into the speed\r\nof 1830 Groombridge, furnish a remarkable result. It is calculated,\r\nindeed, that had this star been _falling through infinite space for\r\never_, pulled towards us by the combined gravitative force of our entire\r\nsystem of stars, it could not have gathered up anything like the speed\r\nwith which it is at present moving. No force, therefore, which we can\r\nconjure out of our visible universe, seems powerful enough either to\r\nhave impressed upon this runaway star the motion which it now has, or to\r\nstay it in its wild course. What an astounding condition of things!\r\n\r\nSpeculations like this call up a suspicion that there may yet exist\r\nother universes, other centres of force, notwithstanding the apparent\r\nsolitude of our stellar system in space. It will be recollected that the\r\nidea of this isolation is founded upon such facts as, that the heavens\r\ndo not blaze with light, and that the stars gradually appear to thin out\r\nas we penetrate the system with increasing telescopic power. But\r\nperchance there is something which hinders us from seeing out into space\r\nbeyond our cluster of stars; which prevents light, in fact, from\r\nreaching us from other possible systems scattered through the depths\r\nbeyond. It has, indeed, been suggested by Mr. Gore[38] that the\r\nlight-transmitting ether may be after all merely a kind of \"atmosphere\"\r\nof the stars; and that it may, therefore, thin off and cease a little\r\nbeyond the confines of our stellar system, just as the air thins off and\r\npractically ceases at a comparatively short distance from the earth. A\r\nclashing together of solid bodies outside our atmosphere could plainly\r\nsend us no sound, for there is no air extending the whole way to bear to\r\nour ears the vibrations thus set up; so light emitted from any body\r\nlying beyond our system of stars, would not be able to come to us if the\r\nether, whose function it is to convey the rays of light, ceased at or\r\nnear the confines of that system.\r\n\r\nPerchance we have in this suggestion the key to the mystery of how our\r\nsun and the other stellar bodies maintain their functions of temperature\r\nand illumination. The radiations of heat and light arriving at the\r\nlimits of this ether, and unable to pass any further, may be thrown back\r\nagain into the system in some altered form of energy.\r\n\r\nBut these, at best, are mere airy and fascinating speculations. We have,\r\nindeed, no evidence whatever that the luminiferous ether ceases at the\r\nboundary of the stellar system. If, therefore, it extends outwards\r\ninfinitely in every direction, and if it has no absorbing or weakening\r\neffect on the vibrations which it transmits, we cannot escape from the\r\nconclusion that practically all the rays of light ever emitted by all\r\nthe stars must chase one another eternally through the never-ending\r\nabysses of space.\r\n\r\n\r\n[38] _Planetary and Stellar Studies_, by John Ellard Gore, F.R.A.S.,\r\nM.R.I.A., London, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPLACE'S NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS\r\n\r\nDwelling upon the fact that all the motions of revolution and rotation\r\nin the solar system, as known in his day, took place in the same\r\ndirection and nearly in the same plane, the great French astronomer,\r\nLaplace, about the year 1796, put forward a theory to account for the\r\norigin and evolution of that system. He conceived that it had come into\r\nbeing as a result of the gradual contraction, through cooling, of an\r\nintensely heated gaseous lens-shaped mass, which had originally occupied\r\nits place, and had extended outwards beyond the orbit of the furthest\r\nplanet. He did not, however, attempt to explain how such a mass might\r\nhave originated! He went on to suppose that this mass, _in some manner_,\r\nperhaps by mutual gravitation among its parts, had acquired a motion of\r\nrotation in the same direction as the planets now revolve. As this\r\nnebulous mass parted with its heat by radiation, it contracted towards\r\nthe centre. Becoming smaller and smaller, it was obliged to rotate\r\nfaster and faster in order to preserve its equilibrium. Meanwhile, in\r\nthe course of contraction, rings of matter became separated from the\r\nnucleus of the mass, and were left behind at various intervals. These\r\nrings were swept up into subordinate masses similar to the original\r\nnebula. These subordinate masses also contracted in the same manner,\r\nleaving rings behind them which, in turn, were swept up to form\r\nsatellites. Saturn's ring was considered, by Laplace, as the only\r\nportion of the system left which still showed traces of this\r\nevolutionary process. It is even probable that it may have suggested the\r\nwhole of the idea to him.\r\n\r\nLaplace was, however, not the first philosopher who had speculated along\r\nthese lines concerning the origin of the world.\r\n\r\nNearly fifty years before, in 1750 to be exact, Thomas Wright, of\r\nDurham, had put forward a theory to account for the origin of the whole\r\nsidereal universe. In his theory, however, the birth of our solar system\r\nwas treated merely as an incident. Shortly afterwards the subject was\r\ntaken up by the famous German philosopher, Kant, who dealt with the\r\nquestion in a still more ambitious manner, and endeavoured to account in\r\ndetail for the origin of the solar system as well as of the sidereal\r\nuniverse. Something of the trend of such theories may be gathered from\r\nthe remarkable lines in Tennyson's _Princess_:--\r\n\r\n\"This world was once a fluid haze of light,\r\nTill toward the centre set the starry tides,\r\nAnd eddied into suns, that wheeling cast\r\nThe planets.\"\r\n\r\nThe theory, as worked out by Kant, was, however, at the best merely a\r\n_tour de force_ of philosophy. Laplace's conception was much less\r\nambitious, for it did not attempt to explain the origin of the entire\r\nuniverse, but only of the solar system. Being thus reasonably limited in\r\nits scope, it more easily obtained credence. The arguments of Laplace\r\nwere further founded upon a mathematical basis. The great place which\r\nhe occupied among the astronomers of that time caused his theory to\r\nexert a preponderating influence on scientific thought during the\r\ncentury which followed.\r\n\r\nA modification of Laplace's theory is the Meteoritic Hypothesis of Sir\r\nNorman Lockyer. According to the views of that astronomer, the material\r\nof which the original nebula was composed is presumed to have been in\r\nthe meteoric, rather than in the gaseous, state. Sir Norman Lockyer\r\nholds, indeed, that nebulæ are, in reality, vast swarms of meteors, and\r\nthe light they emit results from continual collisions between the\r\nconstituent particles. The French astronomer, Faye, also proposed to\r\nmodify Laplace's theory by assuming that the nebula broke up into rings\r\nall at once, and not in detail, as Laplace had wished to suppose.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of Laplace fits in remarkably well with the theory put\r\nforward in later times by Helmholtz, that the heat of the sun is kept up\r\nby the continual contraction of its mass. It could thus have only\r\ncontracted to its present size from one very much larger.\r\n\r\nPlausible, however, as Laplace's great hypothesis appears on the\r\nsurface, closer examination shows several vital objections, a few of\r\nthose set forth by Professor Moulton being here enumerated--\r\n\r\nAlthough Laplace held that the orbits of the planets were sufficiently\r\nnear to being in the one plane to support his views, yet later\r\ninvestigators consider that their very deviations from this plane are a\r\nstrong argument against the hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is thought that if the theory were the correct explanation,\r\nthe various orbits of the planets would be much more nearly circular\r\nthan they are.\r\n\r\nIt is also thought that such interlaced paths, as those in which the\r\nasteroids and the little planet Eros move, are most unlikely to have\r\nbeen produced as a result of Laplace's nebula.\r\n\r\nFurther, while each of the rings was sweeping up its matter into a body\r\nof respectable dimensions, its gravitative power would have been for the\r\ntime being so weak, through being thus spread out, that any lighter\r\nelements, as, for instance, those of the gaseous order, would have\r\nescaped into space in accordance with the principles of the kinetic\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n_The idea that rings would at all be left behind at certain intervals\r\nduring the contraction of the nebula is, perhaps, one of the weakest\r\npoints in Laplace's hypothesis._\r\n\r\nMathematical investigation does not go to show that the rings, presuming\r\nthey could be left behind during the contraction of the mass, would have\r\naggregated into planetary bodies. Indeed, it rather points to the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nLastly, such a discovery as that the ninth satellite of Saturn revolves\r\nin a _retrograde_ direction--that is to say, in a direction contrary to\r\nthe other revolutions and rotations in our solar system--appears\r\ndirectly to contradict the hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAlthough Laplace's hypothesis seems to break down under the keen\r\ncriticism to which it has been subjected, yet astronomers have not\r\nrelinquished the idea that our solar system has probably had its origin\r\nfrom a nebulous mass. But the apparent failure of the Laplacian theory\r\nis emphasised by the fact, that _not a single example of a nebula, in\r\nthe course of breaking up into concentric rings, is known to exist in\r\nthe entire heaven_. Indeed, as we saw in Chapter XXIV., there seems to\r\nbe no reliable example of even a \"ring\" nebula at all. Mr. Gore has\r\npointed this out very succinctly in his recently published work,\r\n_Astronomical Essays_, where he says:--\"To any one who still persists in\r\nmaintaining the hypothesis of ring formation in nebulæ, it may be said\r\nthat the whole heavens are against him.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of Keeler already alluded to, that the spiral is the\r\nnormal type of nebula, has led during the past few years to a new theory\r\nby the American astronomers, Professors Chamberlin and Moulton. In the\r\ndetailed account of it which they have set forth, they show that those\r\nanomalies which were stumbling-blocks to Laplace's theory do not\r\ncontradict theirs. To deal at length with this theory, to which the name\r\nof \"Planetesimal Hypothesis\" has been given, would not be possible in a\r\nbook of this kind. But it may be of interest to mention that the authors\r\nof the theory in question remount the stream of time still further than\r\ndid Laplace, and seek to explain the _origin_ of the spiral nebulæ\r\nthemselves in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nHaving begun by assuming that the stars are moving apparently in every\r\ndirection with great velocities, they proceed to point out that sooner\r\nor later, although the lapse of time may be extraordinarily long,\r\ncollisions or near approaches between stars are bound to occur. In the\r\ncase of collisions the chances are against the bodies striking together\r\ncentrally, it being very much more likely that they will hit each other\r\nrather towards the side. The nebulous mass formed as a result of the\r\ndisintegration of the bodies through their furious impact would thus\r\ncome into being with a spinning movement, and a spiral would ensue.\r\nAgain, the stars may not actually collide, but merely approach near to\r\neach other. If very close, the interaction of gravitation will give rise\r\nto intense strains, or tides, which will entirely disintegrate the\r\nbodies, and a spiral nebula will similarly result. As happens upon our\r\nearth, two such tides would rise opposite to each other; and,\r\nconsequently, it is a noticeable fact that spiral nebulæ have almost\r\ninvariably two opposite branches (see Plate XXII., p 314). Even if not\r\nso close, the gravitational strains set up would produce tremendous\r\neruptions of matter; and in this case, a spiral movement would also be\r\ngenerated. On such an assumption the various bodies of the solar system\r\nmay be regarded as having been ejected from parent masses.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of the Planetesimal Hypothesis in the place of the\r\nHypothesis of Laplace will not, as we have seen, by any means do away\r\nwith the probability that our solar system, and similar systems, have\r\noriginated from a nebulous mass. On the contrary it puts that idea on a\r\nfirmer footing than before. The spiral nebulæ which we see in the\r\nheavens are on a vast scale, and may represent the formation of stellar\r\nsystems and globular clusters. Our solar system may have arisen from a\r\nsmall spiral.\r\n\r\nWe will close these speculations concerning the origin of things with a\r\nshort sketch of certain investigations made in recent years by Sir\r\nGeorge H. Darwin, of Cambridge University, into the question of the\r\nprobable birth of our moon. He comes to the conclusion that at least\r\nfifty-four millions of years ago the earth and moon formed one body,\r\nwhich had a diameter of a little over 8000 miles. This body rotated on\r\nan axis in about five hours, namely, about five times as fast as it does\r\nat present. The rapidity of the rotation caused such a tremendous strain\r\nthat the mass was in a condition of, what is called, unstable\r\nequilibrium; very little more, in fact, being required to rend it\r\nasunder. The gravitational pull of the sun, which, as we have already\r\nseen, is in part the cause of our ordinary tides, supplied this extra\r\nstrain, and a portion of the mass consequently broke off, which receded\r\ngradually from the rest and became what we now know as the moon. Sir\r\nGeorge Darwin holds that the gravitational action of the sun will in\r\ntime succeed in also disturbing the present apparent harmony of the\r\nearth-moon system, and will eventually bring the moon back towards the\r\nearth, so that after the lapse of great ages they will re-unite once\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn support of this theory of the terrestrial origin of the moon,\r\nProfessor W.H. Pickering has put forward a bold hypothesis that our\r\nsatellite had its origin in the great basin of the Pacific. This ocean\r\nis roughly circular, and contains no large land masses, except the\r\nAustralian Continent. He supposes that, prior to the moon's birth, our\r\nglobe was already covered with a slight crust. In the tearing away of\r\nthat portion which was afterwards destined to become the moon the\r\nremaining area of the crust was rent in twain by the shock; and thus\r\nwere formed the two great continental masses of the Old and New Worlds.\r\nThese masses floated apart across the fiery ocean, and at last settled\r\nin the positions which they now occupy. In this way Professor Pickering\r\nexplains the remarkable parallelism which exists between the opposite\r\nshores of the Atlantic. The fact of this parallelism had, however, been\r\nnoticed before; as, for example, by the late Rev. S.J. Johnson, in his\r\nbook _Eclipses, Past and Future_, where we find the following passage:--\r\n\r\n\"If we look at our maps we shall see the parts of one Continent that jut\r\nout agree with the indented portions of another. The prominent coast of\r\nAfrica would fit in the opposite opening between North and South\r\nAmerica, and so in numerous other instances. A general rending asunder\r\nof the World would seem to have taken place when the foundations of the\r\ngreat deep were broken up.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Professor Pickering's theory is to a certain degree anticipated\r\nin the above words, still he has worked out the idea much more fully,\r\nand given it an additional fascination by connecting it with the birth\r\nof the moon. He points out, in fact, that there is a remarkable\r\nsimilarity between the lunar volcanoes and those in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the Pacific Ocean. He goes even further to suggest that\r\nAustralia is another portion of the primal crust which was detached out\r\nof the region now occupied by the Indian Ocean, where it was originally\r\nconnected with the south of India or the east of Africa.\r\n\r\nCertain objections to the theory have been put forward, one of which is\r\nthat the parallelism noticed between the opposite shores of the Atlantic\r\nis almost too perfect to have remained through some sixty millions of\r\nyears down to our own day, in the face of all those geological movements\r\nof upheaval and submergence, which are perpetually at work upon our\r\nglobe. Professor Pickering, however, replies to this objection by\r\nstating that many geologists believe that the main divisions of land and\r\nwater on the earth are permanent, and that the geological alterations\r\nwhich have taken place since these were formed have been merely of a\r\ntemporary and superficial nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been trying to picture the beginning of things. We will now try\r\nto picture the end.\r\n\r\nIn attempting this, we find that our theories must of necessity be\r\nlimited to the earth, or at most to the solar system. The time-honoured\r\nexpression \"End of the World\" really applies to very little beyond the\r\nend of our own earth. To the people of past ages it, of course, meant\r\nvery much more. For them, as we have seen, the earth was the centre of\r\neverything; and the heavens and all around were merely a kind of minor\r\naccompaniment, created, as they no doubt thought, for their especial\r\nbenefit. In the ancient view, therefore, the beginning of the earth\r\nmeant the beginning of the universe, and the end of the earth the\r\nextinction of all things. The belief, too, was general that this end\r\nwould be accomplished through fire. In the modern view, however, the\r\nbirth and death of the earth, or indeed of the solar system, might pass\r\nas incidents almost unnoticed in space. They would be but mere links in\r\nthe chain of cosmic happenings.\r\n\r\nA number of theories have been forward from time to time prognosticating\r\nthe end of the earth, and consequently of human life. We will conclude\r\nwith a recital of a few of them, though which, if any, is the true one,\r\nthe Last Men alone can know.\r\n\r\nJust as a living creature may at any moment die in the fulness of\r\nstrength through sudden malady or accident, or, on the other hand, may\r\nmeet with death as a mere consequence of old age, so may our globe be\r\ndestroyed by some sudden cataclysm, or end in slow processes of decay.\r\nBarring accidents, therefore, it would seem probable that the growing\r\ncold of the earth, or the gradual extinction of the sun, should after\r\nmany millions of years close the chapter of life, as we know it. On the\r\nformer of these suppositions, the decrease of temperature on our globe\r\nmight perhaps be accelerated by the thinning of the atmosphere, through\r\nthe slow escape into space of its constituent gases, or their gradual\r\nchemical combination with the materials of the earth. The subterranean\r\nheat entirely radiated away, there would no longer remain any of those\r\nvolcanic elevating forces which so far have counteracted the slow\r\nwearing down of the land surface of our planet, and thus what water\r\nremained would in time wash over all. If this preceded the growing cold\r\nof the sun, certain strange evolutions of marine forms of life would be\r\nthe last to endure, but these, too, would have to go in the end.\r\n\r\nShould, however, the actual process be the reverse of this, and the sun\r\ncool down the quicker, then man would, as a consequence of his\r\nscientific knowledge, tend in all probability to outlive the other forms\r\nof terrestrial life. In such a vista we can picture the regions of the\r\nearth towards the north and south becoming gradually more and more\r\nuninhabitable through cold, and human beings withdrawing before the\r\nslow march of the icy boundary, until the only regions capable of\r\nhabitation would lie within the tropics. In such a struggle between man\r\nand destiny science would be pressed to the uttermost, in the devising\r\nof means to counteract the slow diminution of the solar heat and the\r\ngradual disappearance of air and water. By that time the axial rotation\r\nof our globe might possibly have been slowed down to such an extent that\r\none side alone of its surface would be turned ever towards the fast\r\ndying sun. And the mind's eye can picture the last survivors of the\r\nhuman race, huddled together for warmth in a glass-house somewhere on\r\nthe equator, waiting for the end to come.\r\n\r\nThe mere idea of the decay and death of the solar system almost brings\r\nto one a cold shudder. All that sun's light and heat, which means so\r\nmuch to us, entirely a thing of the past. A dark, cold ball rushing\r\nalong in space, accompanied by several dark, cold balls circling\r\nceaselessly around it. One of these a mere cemetery, in which there\r\nwould be no longer any recollection of the mighty empires, the loves and\r\nhates, and all that teeming play of life which we call History.\r\nTombstones of men and of deeds, whirling along forgotten in the darkness\r\nand silence. _Sic transit gloria mundi._\r\n\r\nIn that brilliant flight of scientific fancy, the _Time Machine_, Mr.\r\nH.G. Wells has pictured the closing years of the earth in some such\r\nlong-drawn agony as this. He has given us a vision of a desolate beach\r\nby a salt and almost motionless sea. Foul monsters of crab-like form\r\ncrawl slowly about, beneath a huge hull of sun, red and fixed in the\r\nsky. The rocks around are partly coated with an intensely green\r\nvegetation, like the lichen in caves, or the plants which grow in a\r\nperpetual twilight. And the air is now of an exceeding thinness.\r\n\r\nHe dips still further into the future, and thus predicts the final form\r\nof life:--\r\n\r\n\"I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal--there was no mistake now\r\nthat it was a moving thing--against the red water of the sea. It was a\r\nround thing, the size of a football perhaps, or it may be bigger, and\r\ntentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering\r\nblood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a description of the \"Heir of all the Ages!\"\r\n\r\nTo picture the end of our world as the result of a cataclysm of some\r\nkind, is, on the other hand, a form of speculation as intensely dramatic\r\nas that with which we have just been dealing is unutterably sad.\r\n\r\nIt is not so many years ago, for instance, that men feared a sudden\r\ncatastrophe from the possible collision of a comet with our earth. The\r\nunreasoning terror with which the ancients were wont to regard these\r\nmysterious visitants to our skies had, indeed, been replaced by an\r\napprehension of quite another kind. For instance, as we have seen, the\r\nannouncement in 1832 that Biela's Comet, then visible, would cut through\r\nthe orbit of the earth on a certain date threw many persons into a\r\nveritable panic. They did not stop to find out the real facts of the\r\ncase, namely, that, at the time mentioned, the earth would be nearly a\r\nmonth's journey from the point indicated!\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, very difficult to say what form of damage the earth\r\nwould suffer from such a collision. In 1861 it passed, as we have seen,\r\nthrough the tail of the comet without any noticeable result. But the\r\nhead of a comet, on the other hand, may, for aught we know, contain\r\nwithin it elements of peril for us. A collision with this part might,\r\nfor instance, result in a violent bombardment of meteors. But these\r\nmeteors could not be bodies of any great size, for the masses of comets\r\nare so very minute that one can hardly suppose them to contain any large\r\nor dense constituent portions.\r\n\r\nThe danger, however, from a comet's head might after all be a danger to\r\nour atmosphere. It might precipitate, into the air, gases which would\r\nasphyxiate us or cause a general conflagration. It is scarcely necessary\r\nto point out that dire results would follow upon any interference with\r\nthe balance of our atmosphere. For instance, the well-known French\r\nastronomer, M. Camille Flammarion,[39] has imagined the absorption of\r\nthe nitrogen of the air in this way; and has gone on to picture men and\r\nanimals reduced to breathing only oxygen, first becoming excited, then\r\nmad, and finally ending in a perfect saturnalia of delirium.\r\n\r\nLastly, though we have no proof that stars eventually become dark and\r\ncold, for human time has so far been all too short to give us even the\r\nsmallest evidence as to whether heat and light are diminishing in our\r\nown sun, yet it seems natural to suppose that such bodies must at last\r\ncease their functions, like everything else which we know of. We may,\r\ntherefore, reasonably presume that there are dark bodies scattered in\r\nthe depths of space. We have, indeed, a suspicion of at least one,\r\nthough perhaps it partakes rather of a planetary nature, namely, that\r\n\"dark\" body which continually eclipses Algol, and so causes the\r\ntemporary diminution of its light. As the sun rushes towards the\r\nconstellation of Lyra such an extinguished sun may chance to find itself\r\nin his path; just as a derelict hulk may loom up out of the darkness\r\nright beneath the bows of a vessel sailing the great ocean.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a collision between the sun and a body of this kind could\r\nnot occur with such merciful suddenness. A tedious warning of its\r\napproach would be given from that region of the heavens whither our\r\nsystem is known to be tending. As the dark object would become visible\r\nonly when sufficiently near our sun to be in some degree illuminated by\r\nhis rays, it might run the chance at first of being mistaken for a new\r\nplanet. If such a body were as large, for instance, as our own sun, it\r\nshould, according to Mr. Gore's calculations, reveal itself to the\r\ntelescope some fifteen years before the great catastrophe. Steadily its\r\ndisc would appear to enlarge, so that, about nine years after its\r\ndiscovery, it would become visible to the naked eye. At length the\r\ndoomed inhabitants of the earth, paralysed with terror, would see their\r\nrelentless enemy shining like a second moon in the northern skies.\r\nRapidly increasing in apparent size, as the gravitational attractions of\r\nthe solar orb and of itself interacted more powerfully with diminishing\r\ndistance, it would at last draw quickly in towards the sun and disappear\r\nin the glare.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for us to conceive anything more terrible than these\r\nclosing days, for no menace of catastrophe which we can picture could\r\nbear within it such a certainty of fulfilment. It appears, therefore,\r\nuseless to speculate on the probable actions of men in their now\r\nterrestrial prison. Hope, which so far had buoyed them up in the direst\r\ncalamities, would here have no place. Humanity, in the fulness of its\r\nstrength, would await a wholesale execution from which there could be no\r\nchance at all of a reprieve. Observations of the approaching body would\r\nhave enabled astronomers to calculate its path with great exactness, and\r\nto predict the instant and character of the impact. Eight minutes after\r\nthe moment allotted for the collision the resulting tide of flame would\r\nsurge across the earth's orbit, and our globe would quickly pass away in\r\nvapour.\r\n\r\nAnd what then?\r\n\r\nA nebula, no doubt; and after untold ages the formation possibly from it\r\nof a new system, rising phoenix-like from the vast crematorium and\r\nfilling the place of the old one. A new central sun, perhaps, with its\r\nattendant retinue of planets and satellites. And teeming life,\r\nperchance, appearing once more in the fulness of time, when temperature\r\nin one or other of these bodies had fallen within certain limits, and\r\nother predisposing conditions had supervened.\r\n\r\n  \"The world's great age begins anew,\r\n      The golden years return,\r\n  The earth doth like a snake renew\r\n      Her winter weeds outworn:\r\n  Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam\r\n  Like wrecks of a dissolving dream.\r\n\r\n  A brighter Hellas rears its mountains\r\n      From waves serener far;\r\n  A new Peneus rolls his fountains\r\n      Against the morning star;\r\n  Where fairer Tempes bloom, there sleep\r\n  Young Cyclads on a sunnier deep.\r\n\r\n  A loftier Argo cleaves the main,\r\n      Fraught with a later prize;\r\n  Another Orpheus sings again,\r\n      And loves, and weeps, and dies;\r\n  A new Ulysses leaves once more\r\n  Calypso for his native shore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOh cease! must hate and death return?\r\n    Cease! must men kill and die?\r\nCease! drain not to its dregs the urn\r\n    Of bitter prophecy!\r\nThe world is weary of the past,--\r\nOh might it die or rest at last!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[39] See his work, _La Fin du Monde_, wherein the various ways by which\r\nour world may come to an end are dealt with at length, and in a\r\nprofoundly interesting

Delicate instruments, calculating machines, workshop\r\n     machinery, portable tools, the pedrail, motors ashore and afloat,\r\n     fire engines, automatic machines, sculpturing machines--these are a\r\n     few of the chapters which crowd this splendid\r\n     volume.\"--_Educational News._\r\n\r\n     \"It is difficult to make descriptions of machinery and mechanism\r\n     interesting, but Mr. Williams has the enviable knack of doing so,\r\n     and it is hardly possible to open this book at any page without\r\n     turning up something which you feel you must read; and then you\r\n     cannot stop till you come to the end of the\r\n     chapter.\"--_Electricity._\r\n\r\n     \"This book is full of interest and instruction, and is a welcome\r\n     addition to Messrs.
