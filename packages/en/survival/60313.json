The present study\r\nby Mr. Gilbert L. Wilson is an attempt to add to the scanty knowledge\r\nalready at hand on the subject of the economic life of the American\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nThe work was begun without theory or thesis, but solely with the object\r\nof gathering available data from an old woman expert agriculturist in\r\none of the oldest agricultural tribes accessible to a student of the\r\nUniversity of Minnesota. That the study has unexpectedly revealed certain\r\nvarieties of maize of apparently great value to agriculture in the\r\nsemi-arid areas west of Minnesota is a cause of satisfaction to both Mr.\r\nWilson and myself. This fact again emphasizes the wisdom of research work\r\nin our universities. When, now and then, such practical dollar-and-cent\r\nresults follow such purely scientific researches, the wonder is that\r\nuniversity research work is not generously endowed by businesses which\r\nlargely profit by these researches.\r\n\r\nIt is the intention of those interested in the anthropological work of\r\nthe University of Minnesota that occasional publications will be issued\r\nby the University on anthropological subjects, although at present\r\nthere is no justification for issuing a consecutive series. The present\r\nstudy is the second one in the anthropological field published by the\r\nUniversity. The earlier one is number 6 in the _Studies in the Social\r\nSciences_, issued March, 1916.\r\n\r\n                                                  ALBERT ERNEST JENKS\r\n

Their language is closely akin to that of the Crows with whom\r\nthey claim to have once formed a single tribe; a separation, it is said,\r\nfollowed a quarrel over a slain buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe name Hidatsa was formerly borne by one of the tribal villages. The\r\nother villages consolidated with it, and the name was adopted as that\r\nof the tribe. The name is said to mean “willows,” and it was given the\r\nvillage because the god Itsikama´hidic promised that the villagers should\r\nbecome as numerous as the willows of the Missouri river.\r\n\r\nTradition says that the tribe came from Miniwakan, or Devils Lake, in\r\nwhat is now North Dakota; and that migrating west, they met the Mandans\r\nat the mouth of the Heart River. The two tribes formed an alliance and\r\nattempted to live together as one people. Quarrels between their young\r\nmen caused the tribes to separate, but the Mandans loyally aided their\r\nfriends to build new villages a few miles from their own. How long the\r\ntwo tribes dwelt at the mouth of the Heart is not known. They were found\r\nthere with the Arikaras about 1765. In 1804 Lewis and Clark found the\r\nHidatsas in three villages at the mouth of the Knife River, and the\r\nMandans in two villages a few miles lower down on the Missouri.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 the artist Catlin visited the two tribes, remaining with them\r\nseveral months. A year later Maximilian of Wied visited them with the\r\nartist Bodmer. Copies of Bodmer’s sketches, in beautiful lithograph,\r\nare found in the library of the Minnesota Historical Society. Catlin’s\r\nsketches, also in lithograph, are in the Minneapolis Public Library.\r\n\r\nSmallpox nearly exterminated the Mandans in 1837-8, not more than 150\r\npersons surviving. The same epidemic reduced the Hidatsas to about 500\r\npersons. The remnants of the two tribes united and in 1845 removed up\r\nthe Missouri and built a village at Like-a-fishhook bend close to the\r\ntrading post of Fort Berthold. They were joined by the Arikaras in 1862.\r\nNeighboring lands were set apart as a reservation for them; and there the\r\nthree tribes, now settled on allotments, still dwell.\r\n\r\nThe Mandans and Hidatsas have much intermarried. By custom children\r\nspeak usually the language of their mother, but understand perfectly the\r\ndialect of either tribe.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Washington Matthews, for several years government physician to\r\nthe Fort Berthold Reservation Indians, published a short description\r\nof Hidatsa-Mandan culture and a grammar and vocabulary of the Hidatsa\r\nlanguage.[1] More extensive notes intended by him for publication were\r\ndestroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the writer was called to the pastorate of the Presbyterian church\r\nof Mandan, North Dakota. In ill health, he was advised by his physician\r\nto purchase pony and gun and seek the open; but spade and pick plied\r\namong the old Indian sites in the vicinity proved more interesting. A\r\nconsiderable collection of archaeological objects was accumulated, a part\r\nof which now rests in the shelves of the Minnesota Historical Society;\r\nthe rest will shortly be placed in the collections of the American Museum\r\nof Natural History.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the writer and his brother, Frederick N. Wilson, an artist,\r\nand E. R. Steinbrueck drove by wagon from Mandan to Independence,\r\nFort Berthold reservation. The trip was made to obtain sketches for\r\nillustrating a volume of stories, since published.[2] At Independence the\r\nparty made the acquaintance of Edward Goodbird, his mother Maxi´diwiac,\r\nand the latter’s brother Wolf Chief. A friendship was thus begun which\r\nhas been of the greatest value to the writer of this paper.\r\n\r\nA year later Mr. George G. Heye sent the writer to Fort Berthold\r\nreservation to collect objects of Mandan-Hidatsa culture. Among those\r\nthat were obtained was a rare old medicine shrine. Description of this\r\nshrine and Wolf Chief’s story of its origin have been published.[3]\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the writer and his brother, both now resident in Minneapolis,\r\nwere sent by Dr. Clark Wissler, curator of anthropology, American Museum\r\nof Natural History, to begin cultural studies among the Hidatsas. This\r\nwork, generously supported by the Museum, has been continued by the\r\nwriter each succeeding summer. His reports, preparations to edit which\r\nare now being made, will appear in the Museum’s publications.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1910, the writer was admitted as a student in the Graduate\r\nSchool, University of Minnesota, majoring in Anthropology. At suggestion\r\nof his adviser, Dr. Albert E. Jenks, and with permission of Dr. Wissler,\r\nhe chose for his thesis subject, _Agriculture of the Hidatsa Indians:\r\nAn Indian Interpretation_. It was the adviser’s opinion that such a\r\nstudy held promise of more than usual interest. Most of the tribes in\r\nthe eastern area of what is now the United States practiced agriculture.\r\nIt is well known that maize, potatoes, pumpkins, squashes, beans, sweet\r\npotatoes, cotton, tobacco, and other familiar plants were cultivated\r\nby Indians centuries before Columbus. Early white settlers learned the\r\nvalue of the new food plants, but have left us meager accounts of the\r\nnative methods of tillage; and the Indians, driven from the fields of\r\ntheir fathers, became roving hunters; or adopting iron tools, forgot\r\ntheir primitive implements and methods. The Hidatsas and Mandans, shut\r\nin their stockaded villages on the Missouri by the hostile Sioux, were\r\nnot able to abandon their fields if they would. Living quite out of the\r\nmain lines of railroad traffic, they remained isolated and with culture\r\nalmost unchanged until about 1885, when their village at Fort Berthold\r\nwas broken up. It seemed probable that a carefully prepared account of\r\nHidatsa agriculture might very nearly describe the agriculture practiced\r\nby our northern tribes in pre-Columbian days. It was hoped that this\r\nthesis might be such an account.\r\n\r\nBut the writer is a student of anthropology; and his interest in the\r\npreparation of his thesis could not be that of an agriculturist. The\r\nquestion arose at the beginning of his labors, Shall the materials of\r\nthis thesis be presented as a study merely in primitive agriculture, or\r\nas a phase of material culture interpreting something of the inner life,\r\nof the soul, of an Indian? It is the latter aim that the writer endeavors\r\nto accomplish.\r\n\r\nBut again came up a question, By what plan may this best be done?\r\nThe more usual way would be to collect exhaustively facts from\r\navailable informants; sift from them those facts that are typical and\r\nrepresentative; and present these, properly grouped, with the collector’s\r\ninterpretation of them. But for his purpose and aim, it has seemed to\r\nthe writer that the type choice should be human; that is, instead of\r\nseeking typical facts from multiple sources, he should rather seek a\r\ntypical informant, a representative agriculturist—presumably a woman—of\r\nthe Indian group to be studied, and let the informant interpret her\r\nagricultural experiences in her own way. We might thus expect to learn\r\nhow much one Indian woman knew of agriculture; what she did as an\r\nagriculturist and what were her motives for doing; and what proportion of\r\nher thought and labor were given to her fields.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting both Indians and whites resident on the reservation, the\r\nwriter chose for typical or representative informant, his interpreter’s\r\nmother, Maxi´diwiac.\r\n\r\nThe writer’s summer visit of 1912 to Fort Berthold Reservation was\r\nplanned to obtain material for his thesis. His brother again accompanied\r\nhim, and for the expenses of the trip a grant of $500 was made by\r\nCurator Wissler. This trip the writer will remember as one of the\r\npleasantest experiences of his life. The generous interest of Dr. Jenks\r\nand Dr. Wissler in his plans was equaled by the faithful coöperation\r\nof interpreter and informant. The writer and his brother arrived at\r\nthe reservation in the beginning of corn harvest. As already stated,\r\nMaxi´diwiac was the principal informant, and her account was taken down\r\nalmost literally as translated by Goodbird. Models of tools, drying\r\nstage, and other objects pertaining to agriculture were made and\r\nphotographed, and sketched. Before the harvest closed notes were obtained\r\nwhich furnished the material for the greater part of this thesis.\r\n\r\nIn the summers of 1913, 1914, and 1915, additional matter was recovered.\r\nPreviously written notes were read to Maxi´diwiac and corrections made.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the museum’s annual grant of $250, Dean A. F. Woods,\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, University of Minnesota, in 1914 contributed\r\n$60 for photographing, and collecting specimens of Hidatsa corn; and Mr.\r\nM. L. Wilson of the Agricultural Experiment Station, Bozeman, Montana,\r\nobtained for the writer a grant of $50 for like purposes.\r\n\r\nA few words should now be said of informant and interpreter. Maxi´diwiac,\r\nor Buffalobird-woman, is a daughter of Small Ankle, a leader of the\r\nHidatsas in the trying time of the tribe’s removal to what is now Fort\r\nBerthold reservation. She was born on one of the villages at Knife River\r\ntwo years after the “smallpox year,” or about 1839. She is a conservative\r\nand sighs for the good old times, yet is aware that the younger\r\ngeneration of Indians must adopt civilized ways. Ignorant of English, she\r\nhas a quick intelligence and a memory that is marvelous. To her patience\r\nand loyal interest is chiefly due whatever of value is in this thesis. In\r\nthe sweltering heat of an August day she has continued dictation for nine\r\nhours, lying down but never flagging in her account, when too weary to\r\nsit longer in a chair. Goodbird’s testimony that his mother “knows more\r\nabout old ways of raising corn and squashes than any one else on this\r\nreservation,” is not without probability. Until recently, a small part of\r\nGoodbird’s plowed field was each year reserved for her, that she might\r\nplant corn and beans and squashes, cultivating them in old fashioned\r\nway, by hoe. Such corn, of her own planting and selection, has taken\r\nfirst prize at an agricultural fair, held recently by the reservation\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nEdward Goodbird, or Tsaka´kasạkic, the writer’s interpreter, is a son of\r\nMaxi´diwiac, born about November, 1869. Goodbird was one of the first of\r\nthe reservation children to be sent to the mission school; and he is now\r\nnative pastor of the Congregational chapel at Independence. He speaks the\r\nHidatsa, Mandan, Dakota, and English languages. Goodbird is a natural\r\nstudent; and he has the rarer gift of being an artist. His sketches—and\r\nthey are many—are crude; but they are drawn in true perspective and do\r\nnot lack spirit. Goodbird’s life, dictated by himself, has been recently\r\npublished.[4]\r\n\r\nIndians have the gentle custom of adopting very dear friends by\r\nrelationship terms. By such adoption Goodbird is the writer’s brother;\r\nMaxi´diwiac is his mother.\r\n\r\nFor his part in the account of the _Agriculture of the Hidatsa Indians_,\r\nthe writer claims no credit beyond arranging the material and putting\r\nthe interpreter’s Indian-English translations into proper idiom. Bits\r\nof Indian philosophy and shrewd or humorous observations found in the\r\nnarrative are not the writer’s, but the informant’s, and are as they\r\nfell from her lips. The writer has sincerely endeavored to add to the\r\nnarrative essentially nothing of his own.\r\n\r\n_Agriculture of the Hidatsa Indians_ is not, then, an account merely of\r\nIndian agriculture. It is an Indian woman’s interpretation of economics;\r\nthe thoughts she gave to her fields; the philosophy of her labors.\r\nMay the Indian woman’s story of her toil be a plea for our better\r\nappreciation of her race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTRADITION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe Hidatsas believe that our tribe once lived under the waters of Devils\r\nLake. Some hunters discovered the root of a vine growing downward; and\r\nclimbing it, they found themselves on the surface of the earth. Others\r\nfollowed them, until half the tribe had escaped; but the vine broke under\r\nthe weight of a pregnant woman, leaving the rest prisoners. A part of our\r\ntribe are therefore still beneath the lake.\r\n\r\nMy father, Small Ankle, going, when a young man, on a war party, visited\r\nDevils Lake. “Beneath the waves,” he said, “I heard a faint drumming, as\r\nof drums in a big dance.” This story is true; for Sioux, who now live at\r\nDevils Lake, have also heard this drumming.\r\n\r\nThose of my people who escaped from the lake built villages near by.\r\nThese were of earth lodges, such as my tribe built until very recent\r\nyears; two such earth lodges are still standing on this reservation.\r\n\r\nThe site where an earth lodge has stood is marked by an earthen ring,\r\nrising about what was once the hard trampled floor. There are many such\r\nearthen rings on the shores of Devils Lake, showing that, as tradition\r\nsays, our villages stood there. There were three of these villages, my\r\nfather said, who several times visited the sites.\r\n\r\nNear their villages, the people made gardens; and in these they planted\r\nground beans and wild potatoes, from seed brought with them from their\r\nhome under the water. These vegetables we do not cultivate now; but we do\r\ngather them in the fall, in the woods along the Missouri where they grow\r\nwild. They are good eating.\r\n\r\nThese gardens by Devils Lake I think must have been rather small. I know\r\nthat in later times, whenever my tribe removed up the Missouri to build a\r\nnew village, our fields, the first year, were quite small; for clearing\r\nthe wooded bottom land was hard work. A family usually added to their\r\nclearing each year, until their garden was as large as they cared to\r\ncultivate.\r\n\r\nAs yet, my people knew nothing of corn or squashes. One day a war party,\r\nI think of ten men, wandered west to the Missouri River. They saw on the\r\nother side a village of earth lodges like their own. It was a village of\r\nthe Mandans. The villagers saw the Hidatsas, but like them, feared to\r\ncross over, lest the strangers prove to be enemies.\r\n\r\nIt was autumn, and the Missouri River was running low so that an arrow\r\ncould be shot from shore to shore. The Mandans parched some ears of ripe\r\ncorn with the grain on the cob; they broke the ears in pieces, thrust the\r\npieces on the points of arrows, and shot them across the river. “Eat!”\r\nthey said, whether by voice or signs, I do not know. The word for “eat”\r\nis the same in the Hidatsa and Mandan languages.\r\n\r\nThe warriors ate of the parched corn, and liked it. They returned to\r\ntheir village and said, “We have found a people living by the Missouri\r\nRiver who have a strange kind of grain, which we ate and found good!” The\r\ntribe was not much interested and made no effort to seek the Mandans,\r\nfearing, besides, that they might not be friendly.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few years after, a war party of the Hidatsas crossed the\r\nMissouri and visited the Mandans at their village near Bird Beak Hill.\r\nThe Mandan chief took an ear of yellow corn, broke it in two, and gave\r\nhalf to the Hidatsas. This half-ear the Hidatsas took home, for seed; and\r\nsoon every family was planting yellow corn.\r\n\r\nI think that seed of other varieties of corn, and of beans, squashes, and\r\nsunflowers, were gotten of the Mandans[5] afterwards; but there is no\r\nstory telling of this, that I know.\r\n\r\nI do not know when my people stopped planting ground beans and wild\r\npotatoes; but ground beans are hard to dig, and the people, anyway, liked\r\nthe new kind of beans better.\r\n\r\nWhether the ground beans and wild potatoes of the Missouri bottoms are\r\ndescended from the seed planted by the villagers at Devils Lake, I do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMy tribe, as our old men tell us, after they got corn, abandoned their\r\nvillages at Devils Lake, and joined the Mandans near the mouth of the\r\nHeart River. The Mandans helped them build new villages here, near their\r\nown. I think this was hundreds of years ago.\r\n\r\nFirewood growing scarce, the two tribes removed up the Missouri to the\r\nmouth of the Knife River, where they built the Five Villages, as they\r\ncalled them. Smallpox was brought to my people here, by traders. In a\r\nsingle year, more than half my tribe died, and of the Mandans, even more.\r\n\r\nThose who survived removed up the Missouri and built a village at\r\nLike-a-fishhook bend, where they lived together, Hidatsas and Mandans,\r\nas one tribe. This village we Hidatsas called Mu´a-idu´skupe-hi´cec, or\r\nLike-a-fishhook village, after the bend on which it stood; but white men\r\ncalled it Fort Berthold, from a trading post that was there.\r\n\r\nWe lived in Like-a-fishhook village about forty years, or until 1885,\r\nwhen the government began to place families on allotments.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the Hidatsas, as I now describe it, I saw practiced in\r\nthe gardens of Like-a-fishhook village, in my girlhood, before my tribe\r\nowned plows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An earth lodge\r\n\r\nNote ladder at right of lodge entrance.

George Curtis.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBEGINNING A GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turtle_\r\n\r\nMy great-grandmother, as white men count their kin, was named Atạ´kic, or\r\nSoft-white Corn. She adopted a daughter, Mata´tic, or Turtle. Some years\r\nafter, a daughter was born to Atạ´kic, whom she named Otter.\r\n\r\nTurtle and Otter both married. Turtle had a daughter named Ica´wikec, or\r\nCorn Sucker;[6] and Otter had three daughters, Want-to-be-a-woman, Red\r\nBlossom, and Strikes-many-women, all younger than Corn Sucker.\r\n\r\nThe smallpox year at Five Villages left Otter’s family with no male\r\nmembers to support them. Turtle and her daughter were then living in\r\nOtter’s lodge; and Otter’s daughters, as Indian custom bade, called Corn\r\nSucker their elder sister.\r\n\r\nIt was a custom of the Hidatsas, that if the eldest sister of a household\r\nmarried, her younger sisters were also given to her husband, as they\r\ncame of marriageable age. Left without male kin by the smallpox, my\r\ngrandmother’s family was hard put to it to get meat; and Turtle gladly\r\ngave her daughter to my father, Small Ankle, whom she knew to be a good\r\nhunter. Otter’s daughters, reckoned as Corn Sucker’s sisters, were given\r\nto Small Ankle as they grew up; the eldest, Want-to-be-a-woman, was my\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nWhen I was four years old, my tribe and the Mandans came to\r\nLike-a-fishhook bend. They came in the spring and camped in tepees, or\r\nskin tents. By Butterfly’s winter count, I know they began building earth\r\nlodges the next winter. I was too young to remember much of this.\r\n\r\nTwo years after we came to Like-a-fishhook bend, smallpox again visited\r\nmy tribe; and my mother, Want-to-be-a-woman, and Corn Sucker, died of\r\nit. Red Blossom and Strikes-many-women survived, whom I now called my\r\nmothers. Otter and old Turtle lived with us; I was taught to call them my\r\ngrandmothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clearing Fields_\r\n\r\nSoon after they came to Like-a-fishhook bend, the families of my tribe\r\nbegan to clear fields, for gardens, like those they had at Five Villages.\r\nRich black soil was to be found in the timbered bottom lands of the\r\nMissouri. Most of the work of clearing was done by the women.\r\n\r\nIn old times we Hidatsas never made our gardens on the untimbered,\r\nprairie land, because the soil there is too hard and dry. In the bottom\r\nlands by the Missouri, the soil is soft and easy to work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1\r\n\r\nMap of newly broken field drawn under Buffalobird-woman’s direction. The\r\nheavy dots represent corn hills; the dashes, the clearing and breaking of\r\nground between, done after hills were planted.\r\n\r\nIn the lower left hand corner is the ground that was in dispute.]\r\n\r\nMy mothers and my two grandmothers worked at clearing our family’s\r\ngarden. It lay east of the village at a place where many other families\r\nwere clearing fields.\r\n\r\nI was too small to note very much at first. But I remember that my father\r\nset boundary marks—whether wooden stakes or little mounds of earth or\r\nstones, I do not now remember—at the corners of the field we claimed.\r\nMy mothers and my two grandmothers began at one end of this field and\r\nworked forward. All had heavy iron hoes, except Turtle, who used an old\r\nfashioned wooden digging stick.\r\n\r\nWith their hoes, my mothers cut the long grass that covered much of the\r\nfield, and bore it off the line, to be burned. With the same implements,\r\nthey next dug and softened the soil in places for the corn hills, which\r\nwere laid off in rows. These hills they planted. Then all summer they\r\nworked with their hoes, clearing and breaking the ground between the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nTrees and bushes I know must have been cut off with iron axes; but I\r\nremember little of this, because I was only four years old when the\r\nclearing was begun.\r\n\r\nI have heard that in very old times, when clearing a new field, my people\r\nfirst dug the corn hills with digging sticks; and afterwards, like my\r\nmothers, worked between the hills, with bone hoes. My father told me this.\r\n\r\nWhether stone axes were used in old times to cut the trees and\r\nundergrowths, I do not know. I think fields were never then laid out on\r\nground that had large trees on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dispute and Its Settlement_\r\n\r\nAbout two years after the first ground was broken in our field, a dispute\r\nI remember, arose between my mothers and two of their neighbors, Lone\r\nWoman and Goes-to-next-timber.\r\n\r\nThese two women were clearing fields adjoining that of my mothers; as\r\nwill be seen by the accompanying map (figure 1), the three fields met at\r\na corner. I have said that my father, to set up claim to his field, had\r\nplaced marks, one of them in the corner at which met the fields of Lone\r\nWoman and Goes-to-next-timber; but while my mothers were busy clearing\r\nand digging up the other end of their field, their two neighbors invaded\r\nthis marked-off corner; Lone Woman had even dug up a small part before\r\nshe was discovered.\r\n\r\nHowever, when they were shown the mark my father had placed, the two\r\nwomen yielded and accepted payment for any rights they might have.\r\n\r\nIt was our Indian rule to keep our fields very sacred. We did not like\r\nto quarrel about our garden lands. One’s title to a field once set\r\nup, no one ever thought of disputing it; for if one were selfish and\r\nquarrelsome, and tried to seize land belonging to another, we thought\r\nsome evil would come upon him, as that some one of his family would die.\r\nThere is a story of a black bear who got into a pit that was not his own,\r\nand had his mind taken away from him for doing so!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turtle Breaking Soil_\r\n\r\nLone Woman and Goes-to-next-timber having withdrawn, my grandmother,\r\nTurtle, volunteered to break the soil of the corner that had been in\r\ndispute. She was an industrious woman. Often, when my mothers were busy\r\nin the earth lodge, she would go out to work in the garden, taking me\r\nwith her for company. I was six years old then, I think, quite too little\r\nto help her any, but I liked to watch my grandmother work.\r\n\r\nWith her digging stick, she dug up a little round place in the center\r\nof the corner (figure 1); and circling around this from day to day, she\r\ngradually enlarged the dug-up space. The point of her digging stick she\r\nforced into the soft earth to a depth equal to the length of my hand, and\r\npried up the soil. The clods she struck smartly with her digging stick,\r\nsometimes with one end, sometimes with the other. Roots of coarse grass,\r\nweeds, small brush and the like, she took in her hand and shook, or\r\nstruck them against the ground, to knock off the loose earth clinging to\r\nthem; she then cast them into a little pile to dry.\r\n\r\nIn this way she accumulated little piles, scattered rather irregularly\r\nover the dug-up ground, averaging, perhaps, four feet, one from the\r\nother. In a few days these little piles had dried; and Turtle gathered\r\nthem up into a heap, about four feet high, and burned them, sometimes\r\nwithin the cleared ground, sometimes a little way outside.\r\n\r\nIn the corner that had been in dispute, and in other parts of the field,\r\nmy grandmother worked all summer. I do not remember how big our garden\r\nwas at the end of her summer’s work, nor how many piles of roots she\r\nburned; but I remember distinctly how she put the roots of weeds and\r\ngrass and brush into little piles to dry, which she then gathered into\r\nheaps and burned. She did not attempt to burn over the whole ground, only\r\nthe heaps.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, we increased our garden from year to year until it was as\r\nlarge as we needed. I remember seeing my grandmother digging along the\r\nedges of the garden with her digging stick, to enlarge the field and make\r\nthe edges even and straight.\r\n\r\nI remember also, that as Turtle dug up a little space, she would wait\r\nuntil the next season to plant it. Thus, additional ground dug up in the\r\nsummer or fall would be planted by her the next spring.\r\n\r\nThere were two or three elm trees in the garden; these my grandmother\r\nleft standing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2\r\n\r\nFigure 2. Drawn from specimen in author’s collection. Length of specimen,\r\n37½ inches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Drawn from model made by Buffalobird-woman, duplicating that\r\nused by her grandmother. Specimen is of full size. Length of wooden\r\nhandle, 35 inches; length of bone blade, 8½ inches. The blade is made of\r\nthe shoulder bone of an ox.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that upon Turtle fell all the work of clearing\r\nland to enlarge our garden; but she liked to have me with her when she\r\nworked, and I remember best what I saw her do. As I was a little girl\r\nthen, I have forgotten much that she did; but this that I have told, I\r\nremember distinctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turtle’s Primitive Tools_\r\n\r\nIn breaking ground for our garden, Turtle always used an ash digging\r\nstick (figure 2); and when hoeing time came, she hoed the corn with\r\na bone hoe (figure 3). Digging sticks are still used in my tribe for\r\ndigging wild turnips; but even in my grandmother’s lifetime, digging\r\nsticks and bone hoes, as garden tools, had all but given place to iron\r\nhoes and axes.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother was one of the last women of my tribe to cling to these\r\nold fashioned implements. Two other women, I remember, owned bone hoes\r\nwhen I was a little girl; but Turtle, I think, was the very last one in\r\nthe tribe who actually worked in her garden with one.\r\n\r\nThis hoe my grandmother kept in the lodge, under her bed; and when any\r\nof the children of the household tried to get it out to look at it, she\r\nwould cry, “Let that hoe alone; you will break it!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beginning a Field in Later Times_\r\n\r\nAs I grew up, I learned to work in the garden, as every Hidatsa woman was\r\nexpected to learn; but iron axes and hoes, bought of the traders, were\r\nnow used by everybody, and the work of clearing and breaking a new field\r\nwas less difficult than it had been in our grandfathers’ times. A family\r\nhad also greater freedom in choosing where they should have their garden,\r\nsince with iron axes they could more easily cut down any small trees and\r\nbushes that might be on the land. However, to avoid having to cut down\r\nbig trees, a rather open place was usually chosen.\r\n\r\nA family, then, having chosen a place for a field, cleared off the ground\r\nas much as they could, cutting down small trees and bushes in such\r\nway that the trees fell all in one direction. Some of the timber that\r\nwas fit might be taken home for firewood; the rest was let lie to dry\r\nuntil spring, when it was fired. The object of felling the trees in one\r\ndirection was to make them cover the ground as much as possible, since\r\nfiring them softened the soil and left it loose and mellow for planting.\r\nWe sought always to burn over all the ground, if we could.\r\n\r\nBefore firing, the family carefully raked off the dry grass and leaves\r\nfrom the edge of the field, and cut down any brush wood. This was done\r\nthat the fire might not spread to the surrounding timber, nor out on the\r\nprairie. Prairie fires and forest fires are even yet not unknown on our\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\nPlanting season having come, the women of the household planted the\r\nfield in corn. The hills were in rows, and about four feet or a little\r\nless apart. They were rather irregularly placed the first year. It was\r\neasy to make a hill in the ashes where a brush heap had been fired, or\r\nin soil that was free of roots and stumps; but there were many stumps\r\nin the field, left over from the previous summer’s clearing. If the\r\nplanter found a stump stood where a hill should be, she placed the hill\r\non this side the stump or beyond it, no matter how close this brought the\r\nhill to the next in the row. Thus, the corn hills did not stand at even\r\ndistances in the row the first year; but the rows were always kept even\r\nand straight.\r\n\r\nWhile the corn was coming up, the women worked at clearing out the roots\r\nand smaller stumps between the hills; but a stump of any considerable\r\nsize was left to rot, especially if it stood midway between two corn\r\nhills, where it did not interfere with their cultivation.\r\n\r\nMy mothers and I used to labor in a similar way to enlarge our fields.\r\nWith our iron hoes we made hills along the edge of the field and planted\r\ncorn; then, as we had opportunity, we worked with our hoes between the\r\ncorn hills to loosen up the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4\r\n\r\nDrawn from specimen made by Yellow Hair. Length of specimen, following\r\ncurvature of tines, 36½ inches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5\r\n\r\nDrawn from specimen made by Buffalobird-woman. Length of wooden handle,\r\n42 inches; spread of tines of antler, 15½ inches.]\r\n\r\nAlthough our tribe now had iron axes and hoes from the traders, they\r\nstill used their native made rakes. These were of wood (figure 4), or of\r\nthe antler of a black-tailed deer (figure 5). It was with such rakes that\r\nthe edges of a newly opened field were cleaned of leaves for the firing\r\nof the brush, in the spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the field with a horn rake]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hoeing squashes with a bone hoe]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trees in the Garden_\r\n\r\nTrees were not left standing in the garden, except perhaps one to shade\r\nthe watchers’ stage. If a tree stood in the field, it shaded the corn;\r\nand that on the north side of the tree never grew up strong, and the\r\nstalks would be yellow.\r\n\r\nCottonwood trees were apt to grow up in the field, unless the young\r\nshoots were plucked up as they appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our West Field_\r\n\r\nThe field which Turtle helped to clear, lay, I have said, east of the\r\nvillage. I was about nineteen years old, I think, when my mothers\r\ndetermined to clear ground for a second field, west of the village.\r\n\r\nThere were five of us who undertook the work, my father, my two mothers,\r\nRed Blossom and Strikes-many-women, my sister, Cold Medicine, and myself.\r\nWe began in the fall, after harvesting the corn from our east garden, so\r\nthat we had leisure for the work; we had been too busy to begin earlier\r\nin the season.\r\n\r\nWe chose a place down in the bottoms, overgrown with willows; and with\r\nour axes we cut the willows close to the ground, letting them lie as they\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nI do not know how many days we worked; but we stopped when we had cleared\r\na field of about seventy-five by one hundred yards, perhaps. In our east,\r\nor yellow corn field, we counted nine rows of corn to one na´xu; and I\r\nremember that when we came to plant our new field, it had nine na´xu.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Burning Over the Field_\r\n\r\nThe next spring my father, his two wives, my sister and I went out and\r\nburned the felled willows and brush which the spring sun had dried. We\r\ndid not burn them every day; only when the weather was fine. We would go\r\nout after breakfast, burn until tired of the work, and come home.\r\n\r\nWe sought to burn over the whole field, for we knew that this left a\r\ngood, loose soil. We did not pile the willows in heaps, but loosened\r\nthem from the ground or scattered them loosely but evenly over the soil.\r\nIn some places the ground was quite bare of willows; but we collected\r\ndry grass and weeds and dead willows, and strewed them over these bare\r\nplaces, so that the fire would run over the whole area of the field.\r\n\r\nIt took us about four days to burn over the field.\r\n\r\nIt was well known in my tribe that burning over new ground left the soil\r\nsoft and easy to work, and for this reason we thought it a wise thing to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSUNFLOWERS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remark by Maxi´diwiac_\r\n\r\nThis that I am going to tell you of the planting and harvesting of our\r\ncrops is out of my own experience, seen with my own eyes. In olden times,\r\nI know, my tribe used digging sticks and bone hoes for garden tools; and\r\nI have described how I saw my grandmother use them. There may be other\r\ntools or garden customs once in use in my tribe, and now forgotten; of\r\nthem I cannot speak. There were families in Like-a-fishhook village less\r\nindustrious than ours, and some families may have tilled their fields\r\nin ways a little different; of them, also, I can not speak. This that I\r\nnow tell is as I saw my mothers do, or did myself, when I was young. My\r\nmothers were industrious women, and our family had always good crops;\r\nand I will tell now how the women of my father’s family cared for their\r\nfields, as I saw them, and helped them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting Sunflowers_\r\n\r\nThe first seed that we planted in the spring was sunflower seed. Ice\r\nbreaks on the Missouri about the first week in April; and we planted\r\nsunflower seed as soon after as the soil could be worked. Our native\r\nname for the lunar month that corresponds most nearly to April, is\r\nMapi´-o´cë-mi´di, or Sunflower-planting-moon.\r\n\r\nPlanting was done by hoe, or the woman scooped up the soil with her\r\nhands. Three seeds were planted in a hill, at the depth of the second\r\njoint of a woman’s finger. The three seeds were planted together, pressed\r\ninto the loose soil by a single motion, with thumb and first two fingers.\r\nThe hill was heaped up and patted firm with the palm in the same way as\r\nwe did for corn.\r\n\r\nUsually we planted sunflowers only around the edges of a field. The hills\r\nwere placed eight or nine paces apart; for we never sowed sunflowers\r\nthickly. We thought a field surrounded thus by a sparse-sown row of\r\nsunflowers, had a handsome appearance.\r\n\r\nSometimes all three seeds sprouted and came up together; sometimes only\r\ntwo sprouted; sometimes one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties_\r\n\r\nOf cultivated sunflowers we had several varieties, black, white, red,\r\nstriped, named from the color of the seed. The varieties differed only\r\nin color; all had the same taste and smell, and were treated alike in\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\nWhite sunflower seed when pounded into meal, turned dark, but I think\r\nthis was caused by the parching.\r\n\r\nEach family raised the variety they preferred. The varieties were well\r\nfixed; black seed produced black; white seed, white.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting the Seed_\r\n\r\nAlthough our sunflower seed was the first crop to be planted in the\r\nspring, it was the last to be harvested in the fall.\r\n\r\nFor harvesting, we reckoned two kinds of flowers, or heads.\r\n\r\nA stalk springing from seed of one of our cultivated varieties had one,\r\nsometimes two, or even three larger heads, heavy and full, bending the\r\ntop of the stalk with their weight of seed. Some of these big heads had\r\neach a seed area as much as eleven inches across; and yielded each an\r\neven double handful of seed. We called the seed from these big heads\r\nmapi´-i’ti´a from mapi´, sunflower, or sunflower seed, and i’ti´a, big.\r\n\r\nBesides these larger heads, there were other and smaller heads on the\r\nstalk; and wild sunflowers bearing similar small heads grew in many\r\nplaces along the Missouri, and were sure to be found springing up in\r\nabandoned gardens. These smaller heads of the cultivated, and the heads\r\nof the wild, plants, were never more than five inches across; and these\r\nand their seed we called mapi´-na´ka, sunflower’s child or baby sunflower.\r\n\r\nOur sunflowers were ready for harvesting when the little petals that\r\ncovered the seeds fell off, exposing the ripe seeds beneath. Also, the\r\nback of the head turned yellow; earlier in the season it would be green.\r\n\r\nTo harvest the larger heads, I put a basket on my back, and knife in\r\nhand, passed from plant to plant, cutting off each large head, close to\r\nthe stem; the severed heads I tossed into my basket. These heads I did\r\nnot let dry on the stalk, as birds would devour the seeds.\r\n\r\nMy basket filled, I returned to the lodge, climbed the ladder to the\r\nroof, and spread the sunflower heads upon the flat part of the roof\r\naround the smoke hole, to dry. The heads were laid face downward, with\r\nthe backs to the sun. When I was a girl, only three or four earth lodges\r\nin the village had peaked roofs; and these lodges were rather small. All\r\nthe larger and better lodges, those of what we deemed wealthier families,\r\nwere built with the top of the roof flat, like a floor. A flat roof was\r\nuseful to dry things on; and when the weather was fair, the men often sat\r\nthere and gossiped.\r\n\r\nThe sunflower heads were dried face downward, that the sun falling on\r\nthe back of the head might dry and shrink the fiber, thus loosening the\r\nseeds. The heads were laid flat on the bare roof, without skins or other\r\nprotection beneath. If a storm threatened, the unthreshed heads were\r\ngathered up and borne into the lodge; but they were left on the roof\r\novernight, if the weather was fair.\r\n\r\nWhen the heads had dried about four days, the seeds were threshed out;\r\nand I would fetch in from the garden another supply of heads to dry and\r\nthresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Threshing_\r\n\r\nTo thresh the heads, a skin was spread and the heads laid on it face\r\ndownward, and beaten with a stick. Threshing might be on the ground, or\r\non the flat roof, as might be convenient.\r\n\r\nAn average threshing filled a good sized basket, with enough seed left\r\nover to make a small package.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting the Mapi´-na´ka_\r\n\r\nThe smaller heads of the cultivated plants were sometimes gathered,\r\ndried, and threshed, as were the larger heads; but if the season was\r\ngetting late and frost had fallen, and the seeds were getting loose in\r\ntheir pods, I more often threshed these smaller heads and those of the\r\nwild plants directly from the stalk.\r\n\r\nFor this I bore a carrying basket, swinging it around over my breast\r\ninstead of my back; and going about the garden or into the places where\r\nthe wild plants grew, I held the basket under these smaller, or baby\r\nsunflower heads, and beating them smartly with a stick, threshed the\r\nseeds into the basket. It took me about half a day to thresh a basket\r\nhalf full. The seeds I took home to dry, before sacking them.\r\n\r\nThe seeds from the baby sunflowers of both wild and cultivated plants\r\nwere sacked together. The seeds of the large heads were sacked\r\nseparately; and in the spring, when we came to plant, our seed was always\r\ntaken from the sack containing the harvest of the larger heads.\r\n\r\nIn my father’s family, we usually stored away two, sometimes three sacks\r\nof dried sunflower seed for winter use. Sacks were made of skins, perhaps\r\nfourteen inches high and eight inches in diameter, on an average.\r\n\r\nSunflower harvest came after we had threshed our corn; and corn threshing\r\nwas in the first part of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effect of Frost_\r\n\r\nBecause they were gathered later, the seeds of baby sunflowers were\r\nlooked upon as a kind of second crop; and as I have said, they were kept\r\napart from the earlier harvest, because seed for planting was selected\r\nfrom the larger and earlier gathered heads. Gathered thus late, this\r\nsecond crop was nearly always touched by the frost, even before the seeds\r\nwere threshed from the stalks.\r\n\r\nThis frosting of the seeds had an effect upon them that we rather\r\nesteemed. We made a kind of oily meal from sunflower seed, by pounding\r\nthem in a corn mortar; but meal made from seed that had been frosted,\r\nseemed more oily than that from seed gathered before frost fell. The\r\nfreezing of the seeds seemed to bring the oil out of the crushed kernels.\r\n\r\nThis was well known to us. The large heads, left on the roof over night,\r\nwere sometimes caught by the frost; and meal made from their seed was\r\nmore oily than that from unfrosted seed. Sometimes we took the threshed\r\nseed out of doors and let it get frosted, so as to bring out this\r\noiliness. Frosting the seeds did not kill them.\r\n\r\nThe oiliness brought out by the frosting was more apparent in the seeds\r\nof baby sunflowers than in seeds of the larger heads. Seeds of the latter\r\nseemed never to have as much oil in them as seeds of the baby sunflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Parching the Seed_\r\n\r\nTo make sunflower meal the seeds were first roasted, or parched. This\r\nwas done in a clay pot, for iron pots were scarce in my tribe when I was\r\nyoung. The clay pot in use in my father’s family was about a foot high\r\nand eight or nine inches in diameter, as you see from measurements I make\r\nwith my hands.\r\n\r\nThis pot I set on the lodge fire, working it down into the coals with a\r\nrocking motion, and raked coals around it; the mouth I tipped slightly\r\ntoward me. I threw into the pot two or three double-handfuls of the seeds\r\nand as they parched, I stirred them with a little stick, to keep them\r\nfrom burning. Now and then I took out a seed and bit it; if the kernel\r\nwas soft and gummy, I knew the parching was not done; but when it bit dry\r\nand crisp, I knew the seeds were cooked and I dipped them out with a horn\r\nspoon into a wooden bowl.\r\n\r\nAgain I threw into the pot two or three double-handfuls of seed to parch;\r\nand so, until I had enough.\r\n\r\nAs the pot grew quite hot I was careful not to touch it with my hands.\r\nThe parching done, I lifted the pot out, first throwing over it a piece\r\nof old tent cover to protect my two hands.\r\n\r\nParching the seeds caused them to crack open somewhat.\r\n\r\nThe parched seeds were pounded in the corn mortar to make meal. Pounding\r\nsunflower seeds took longer, and was harder work, than pounding corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Four-vegetables-mixed_\r\n\r\nSunflower meal was used in making a dish that we called\r\ndo´patsa-makihi´kĕ, or four-vegetables-mixed; from do´patsa, four things;\r\nand makihi´kĕ, mixed or put together. Four-vegetables-mixed we thought\r\nour very best dish.\r\n\r\nTo make this dish, enough for a family of five, I did as follows:\r\n\r\nI put a clay pot with water on the fire.\r\n\r\nInto the pot I threw one double-handful of beans. This was a fixed\r\nquantity; I put in just one double-handful whether the family to be\r\nserved was large or small; for a larger quantity of beans in this dish\r\nwas apt to make gas on one’s stomach.\r\n\r\nWhen we dried squash in the fall we strung the slices upon strings of\r\ntwisted grass, each seven Indian fathoms long; an Indian fathom is the\r\ndistance between a woman’s two hands outstretched on either side. From\r\none of these seven-fathom strings I cut a piece as long as from my\r\nelbow to the tip of my thumb; the two ends of the severed piece I tied\r\ntogether, making a ring; and this I dropped into the pot with the beans.\r\n\r\nWhen the squash slices were well cooked I lifted them out of the pot by\r\nthe grass string into a wooden bowl. With a horn spoon I chopped and\r\nmashed the cooked squash slices into a mass, which I now returned to the\r\npot with the beans. The grass string I threw away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6\r\n\r\nDrawn from specimens in author’s collection.]\r\n\r\nTo the mess I now added four or five double-handfuls of mixed meal, of\r\npounded parched sunflower seed and pounded parched corn. The whole was\r\nboiled for a few minutes more, and was ready for serving.\r\n\r\nI have already told how we parched sunflower seed; and that I used two\r\nor three double-handfuls of seed to a parching. I used two parchings of\r\nsunflower seed for one mess of four-vegetables-mixed. I also used two\r\nparchings of corn; but I put more corn into the pot at a parching than I\r\ndid of sunflower seed.\r\n\r\nPounding the parched corn and sunflower seed reduced their bulk so that\r\nthe four parchings, two of sunflower seed and two of corn, made but four\r\nor five double-handfuls of the mixed meal.\r\n\r\nFour-vegetables-mixed was eaten freshly cooked; and the mixed\r\ncorn-and-sunflower meal was made fresh for it each time. A little alkali\r\nsalt might be added for seasoning, but even this was not usual. No other\r\nseasoning was used. Meat was not boiled with the mess, as the sunflower\r\nseed gave sufficient oil to furnish fat.\r\n\r\nFour-vegetables-mixed was a winter food; and the squash used in its\r\nmaking was dried, sliced squash, never green, fresh squash.\r\n\r\nThe clay pot used for boiling this and other dishes was about the size of\r\nan iron dinner pot, or even larger. For a large family, the pot might be\r\nas much as thirteen or fourteen inches high. I have described that in use\r\nin my father’s family.\r\n\r\nWhen a mess of four-vegetables-mixed was cooked, I did not remove the pot\r\nfrom the coals, but dipped out the vegetables with a mountain-sheep horn\r\nspoon, into wooden bowls (figure 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunflower-seed Balls_\r\n\r\nSunflower meal of the parched seeds was also used to make sunflower seed\r\nballs; these were important articles of diet in olden times, and had a\r\nparticular use.\r\n\r\nFor sunflower-seed balls I parched the seeds in a pot in the usual way,\r\nput them in a corn mortar and pounded them. When they were reduced to a\r\nfine meal I reached into the mortar and took out a handful of the meal,\r\nsqueezing it in the fingers and palm of my right hand. This squeezing it\r\nmade it into a kind of lump or ball.\r\n\r\nThis ball I enclosed in the two palms and gently shook it. The shaking\r\nbrought out the oil of the seeds, cementing the particles of the meal\r\nand making the lump firm. I have said that frosted seeds gave out more\r\noil than unfrosted; and that baby sunflower seeds gave out more oil than\r\nseeds from the big heads.\r\n\r\nIn olden times every warrior carried a bag of soft skin at his left\r\nside, supported by a thong over his right shoulder; in this bag he kept\r\nneedles, sinews, awl, soft tanned skin for making patches for moccasins,\r\ngun caps, and the like. The warrior’s powder horn hung on the outside of\r\nthis bag.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of this soft-skin bag the warrior commonly carried one of\r\nthese sunflower-seed balls, wrapped in a piece of buffalo-heart skin.\r\nWhen worn with fatigue or overcome with sleep and weariness, the warrior\r\ntook out his sunflower-seed ball, and nibbled at it to refresh himself.\r\nIt was amazing what effect nibbling at the sunflower-seed ball had. If\r\nthe warrior was weary, he began to feel fresh again; if sleepy, he grew\r\nwakeful.\r\n\r\nSometimes the warrior kept his sunflower-seed ball in his flint case that\r\nhung always at his belt over his right hip.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a general custom in my tribe for a warrior or hunter to\r\ncarry one of these sunflower-seed balls.\r\n\r\nWe called the sunflower-seed ball mapi´, the same name as for sunflower.\r\n\r\nSunflower meal, parched and pounded as described, was often mixed with\r\ncorn balls, to which it gave an agreeable smell, as well as a pleasant\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCORN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting_\r\n\r\nCorn planting began the second month after sunflower-seed was planted,\r\nthat is in May; and it lasted about a month. It sometimes continued\r\npretty well into June, but not later than that; for the sun then begins\r\nto go back into the south, and men began to tell eagle-hunting stories.\r\n\r\nWe knew when corn planting time came by observing the leaves of the wild\r\ngooseberry bushes. This bush is the first of the woods to leaf in the\r\nspring. Old women of the village were going to the woods daily to gather\r\nfire wood; and when they saw that the wild gooseberry bushes were almost\r\nin full leaf, they said, “It is time for you to begin planting corn!”\r\n\r\nCorn was planted each year in the same hills.\r\n\r\nAround each of the old and dead hills I loosened the soil with my hoe,\r\nfirst pulling up the old, dead roots of the previous year’s plants; these\r\ndead roots, as they collected, were raked off with other refuse to one\r\nend of the field outside of the cultivated ground, to be burned.\r\n\r\nThis pulling up of the dead roots and working around the old hill with\r\nthe hoe, left the soil soft and loose for the space of about eighteen\r\ninches in diameter; and in this soft soil I planted the corn in this\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nI stooped over, and with fingers of both hands I raked away the loose\r\nsoil for a bed for the seed; and with my fingers I even stirred the soil\r\naround with a circular motion to make the bed perfectly level so that the\r\nseeds would all lie at the same depth.\r\n\r\nA small vessel, usually a wooden bowl, at my feet held the seed\r\ncorn. With my right hand I took a small handful of the corn, quickly\r\ntransferring half of it to my left hand; still stooping over, and plying\r\nboth hands at the same time, I pressed the grains a half inch into the\r\nsoil with my thumbs, planting two grains at a time, one with each hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7]\r\n\r\nI planted about six to eight grains in a hill[7] (figure 7). Then with my\r\nhands I raked the earth over the planted grains until the seed lay about\r\nthe length of my fingers under the soil. Finally I patted the hill firm\r\nwith my palms.\r\n\r\nThe space within the hill in which the seed kernels were planted should\r\nbe about nine inches in diameter; but the completed hill should nearly\r\ncover the space broken up by the hoe.\r\n\r\nThe corn hills I planted well apart, because later, in hilling up, I\r\nwould need room to draw earth from all directions over the roots to\r\nprotect them from the sun, that they might not dry out. Corn planted in\r\nhills too close together would have small ears and fewer of them; and the\r\nstalks of the plants would be weak, and often dried out.\r\n\r\nIf the corn hills were so close together that the plants when they grew\r\nup, touched each other, we called them “smell-each-other”; and we knew\r\nthat the ears they bore would not be plump nor large.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Morning’s Planting_\r\n\r\nWe Hidatsa women were early risers in the planting season; it was my\r\nhabit to be up before sunrise, while the air was cool, for we thought\r\nthis the best time for garden work.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the field I would begin one hill, preparing it, as I\r\nhave said, with my hoe; and so for ten rows each as long as from this\r\nspot to yonder fence—about thirty yards; the rows were about four feet\r\napart, and the hills stood about the same distance apart in the row.\r\n\r\nThe hills all prepared, I went back and planted them, patting down each\r\nwith my palms, as described. Planting corn thus by hand was slow work;\r\nbut by ten o’clock the morning’s work was done, and I was tired and ready\r\nto go home for my breakfast and rest; we did not eat before going into\r\nthe field. The ten rows making the morning’s planting contained about two\r\nhundred and twenty-five hills.\r\n\r\nI usually went to the field every morning in the planting season, if the\r\nweather was fine. Sometimes I went out again a little before sunset and\r\nplanted; but this was not usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soaking the Seed_\r\n\r\nThe very last corn that we planted we sometimes put into a little tepid\r\nwater, if the season was late. Seed used for replanting hills that had\r\nbeen destroyed by crows or magpies we also soaked. We left the seed in\r\nthe water only a short time, when the water was poured off.\r\n\r\nThe water should be tepid only, so that when poured through the fingers\r\nit felt hardly warmed. Hot water would kill the seeds.\r\n\r\nSeed corn thus soaked would have sprouts a third of an inch long within\r\nfour or five days after planting, if the weather was warm. I know this,\r\nbecause we sometimes dug up some of the seeds to see. This soaked seed\r\nproduced strong plants, but the first-planted, dry seeds still produced\r\nthe first ripened ears.\r\n\r\nIf warm water was not convenient, I sometimes put these last planted\r\ncorn seeds in my mouth; and when well wetted, planted them. But these\r\nmouth-wetted seeds produced, we thought, a great many wi´da-aka´ta, or\r\ngoose-upper-roof-of-mouth, ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting for a Sick Woman_\r\n\r\nIt was usual for the women of a household to do their own planting; but\r\nif a woman was sick, or for some reason was unable to attend to her\r\nplanting, she sometimes cooked a feast, to which she invited the members\r\nof her age society and asked them to plant her field for her.\r\n\r\nThe members of her society would come upon an appointed day and plant her\r\nfield in a short time; sometimes a half day was enough.\r\n\r\nThere were about thirty members in my age society when I was a young\r\nwoman. If we were invited to plant a garden for some sick woman, each\r\nmember would take a row to plant; and each would strive to complete her\r\nrow first. A member having completed her row, might begin a second, and\r\neven a third row; or if, when each had completed one row, there was but a\r\nsmall part of the field yet unplanted, all pitched in miscellaneously and\r\nfinished the planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Size of Our Biggest Field_\r\n\r\nWhen our corn was in, we began planting beans and squashes. Beans we\r\ncommonly planted between corn rows, sometimes over the whole field, more\r\noften over a part of it. Our bean and squash planting I will describe\r\nlater; and I speak of it now only because I wish to explain to you how a\r\nHidatsa garden was laid out.\r\n\r\nThe largest field ever owned in my father’s family was the one which I\r\nhave said my grandmother Turtle helped clear, at Like-a-fishhook village,\r\nor Fort Berthold, as the whites called it. The field, begun small, was\r\nadded to each year and did not reach its maximum size for some years.\r\n\r\nThe field was nearly rectangular in shape; at the time of its greatest\r\nsize, its length was about equal to the distance from this spot to yonder\r\nfence—one hundred and eighty yards; and its width, to the distance from\r\nthe corner of this cabin to yonder white post—ninety yards.\r\n\r\nThe size of a garden was determined chiefly by the industry of the family\r\nthat owned it, and by the number of mouths that must be fed.\r\n\r\nWhen I was six years old, there were, I think, ten in my father’s family,\r\nof whom my two grandmothers, my mother and her three sisters, made six. I\r\nhave said that my mother and her three sisters were wives of Small Ankle,\r\nmy father. It was this year that my mother and Corn Sucker died, however.\r\n\r\nMy father’s wives and my two grandmothers, all industrious women, added\r\neach year to the area of our field; for our family was growing. At the\r\ntime our garden reached its maximum size, there were seven boys in the\r\nfamily; three of these died young, but four grew up and brought wives to\r\nlive in our earth lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Na´xu and Nu´cami_\r\n\r\nIn our big garden at Like-a-fishhook village, nine rows of corn, running\r\nlengthwise with the field, made one na´xu, or Indian acre, as we usually\r\ntranslate it. There were ten of these na´xus, or Indian acres, in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8]\r\n\r\nSome families of our village counted eight rows of corn to one na´xu,\r\nothers counted ten rows.\r\n\r\nThe rows of the na´xus always ran the length of the garden; and if the\r\nfield curved, as it sometimes did around a bend of the river, or other\r\nirregularity, the rows curved with it.\r\n\r\nIn our garden a row of squashes separated each na´xu from its neighbor.\r\n\r\nFour rows of corn running widthwise with the garden made one nu´cami; and\r\nas was the na´xu, each nu´cami was separated from its neighbor by a row\r\nof squashes, or beans, or in some families, even by sunflowers.\r\n\r\nLike those of the na´xus, the rows of the nu´camis often curved to follow\r\nsome irregularity in the shape of the garden plot. (See figure 8.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hoeing_\r\n\r\nHoeing time began when the corn was about three inches high; but this\r\nvaried somewhat with the season. Some seasons were warm, and the corn and\r\nweeds grew rapidly; other seasons were colder, and delayed the growth of\r\nthe corn.\r\n\r\nCorn plants about three inches high we called\r\n“young-bird’s-feather-tail-corn,” because the plants then had blunt ends,\r\nlike the tail feathers of a very young bird.\r\n\r\nCorn and weeds alike grew rapidly now, and we women of the household were\r\nout with our hoes daily, to keep ahead of the weeds. We worked as in\r\nplanting season, in the early morning hours.\r\n\r\nI cultivated each hill carefully with my hoe as I came to it; and if the\r\nplants were small, I would comb the soil of the hill lightly with my\r\nfingers, loosening the earth and tearing out young weeds.\r\n\r\nWe did not hoe the corn alone, but went right through the garden, corn,\r\nsquashes, beans, and all. Weeds were let lie on the ground, as they were\r\nnow young and harmless.\r\n\r\nWe hoed but once, not very many weeds coming up to bother us afterwards.\r\nIn my girlhood we were not troubled with mustard and thistles; these\r\nweeds have come in with white men.\r\n\r\nIn many families hoeing ended, I think, when the corn was about seven or\r\neight inches high: but I remember when my mothers finished hoeing their\r\nbig field at Like-a-fishhook village, the corn was about eighteen inches\r\nhigh, and the blossoms at the top of the plants were appearing.\r\n\r\nA second hoeing began, it is true, when the corn silk appeared, but was\r\naccompanied by hilling, so that we looked upon it rather as a hilling\r\ntime. Hilling was done to firm the plants against the wind and cover the\r\nroots from the sun. We hilled with earth, about four inches up around the\r\nroots of the corn.\r\n\r\nNot a great many weeds were found in the garden at hilling time, unless\r\nthe season had been wet; but weeds at this season are apt to have seeds,\r\nso that it was my habit to bear such weeds off the field, that the seeds\r\nmight not fall and sprout the next season.\r\n\r\nWith the corn, the squashes and beans were also hilled; but this was an\r\neasier task. The bean hills, especially, were made small at the first,\r\nand hilling them up afterwards was not hard work. If beans were hilled\r\ntoo high the vines got beaten down into the mud by the rains and rotted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Watchers’ Stage_\r\n\r\nOur corn fields had many enemies. Magpies, and especially crows, pulled\r\nup much of the young corn, so that we had to replant many hills. Crows\r\nwere fond of pulling up the green shoots when they were a half inch or\r\nan inch high. Spotted gophers would dig up the seed from the roots of\r\nyoung plants. When the corn had eared, and the grains were still soft,\r\nblackbirds and crows were destructive.\r\n\r\nAny hills of young corn that the birds destroyed, I replanted if the\r\nseason was not too late. If only a part of the plants in a hill had been\r\ndestroyed, I did not disturb the living plants, but replanted only the\r\ndestroyed ones. In the place of each missing plant, I dug a little hole\r\nwith my hand, and dropped in a seed.\r\n\r\nWe made scarecrows[8] to frighten the crows. Two sticks were driven\r\ninto the ground for legs; to these were bound two other sticks, like\r\noutstretched arms; on the top was fastened a ball of cast-away skins, or\r\nthe like, for a head. An old buffalo robe was drawn over the figure and a\r\nbelt tied around its middle, to make it look like a man. Such a scarecrow\r\nwould keep the crows away for a few days but when they saw that the\r\nfigure never moved from its place, they lost their fear and returned.\r\n\r\nA platform, or stage, was often built in a garden, where the girls and\r\nyoung women of the household came to sit and sing as they watched that\r\ncrows and other thieves did not destroy the ripening crop. We cared for\r\nour corn in those days as we would care for a child; for we Indian people\r\nloved our gardens, just as a mother loves her children; and we thought\r\nthat our growing corn liked to hear us sing, just as children like to\r\nhear their mother sing to them.[9] Also, we did not want the birds to\r\ncome and steal our corn. Horses, too, might break in and crop the plants,\r\nor boys might steal the green ears and go off and roast them.\r\n\r\nOur Hidatsa name for such a stage was adukati´ i´kakĕ-ma´tsati, or field\r\nwatchers’ stage; from adukati´, field; i´kakĕ, watch; and ma´tsati,\r\nstage. These stages, while common, were not in every garden. I had one in\r\nmy garden where I used to sit and sing.\r\n\r\nA watchers’ stage resembled a stage for drying grain, but it was built\r\nmore simply. Four posts, forked at the top, supported two parallel\r\nbeams, or stringers; on these beams was laid a floor of puncheons, or\r\nsplit small logs, at about the height of the full grown corn. This floor\r\nwas about the length and breadth of Wolf Chief’s table—forty-three by\r\nthirty-five inches—and was thus large enough to permit two persons to sit\r\ntogether. A ladder made of the trunk of a tree rested against the stage.\r\n\r\nSuch stages we did not value as we did our drying stages, nor did we use\r\nso much care in building them. If the posts were of green wood, we did\r\nnot trouble to peel off the bark; at least, I never saw such posts with\r\nthe bark peeled off. The beams in the forks of the posts often lay with\r\nthe bark on. The puncheons that made the floor of the stage were free of\r\nbark, because they were commonly split from old, dead, floating logs,\r\nthat we got down at the Missouri River; if the whole stage was built of\r\nthese dead logs, as was often done, the bark would be wanting on every\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nA watchers’ stage, indeed, was usually of rather rough construction; wood\r\nwas plentiful and easy to get, and the stage was rebuilt each year.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, it was our custom to locate our gardens on the timbered,\r\nbottom lands, and when we cleared off the timber and brush, we often\r\nleft a tree, usually of cottonwood, standing in the field, to shade the\r\nwatchers’ stage. The stage stood on the north, or shady, side of the tree.\r\n\r\nCottonwood seedlings were apt to spring up in newly cleared ground. If\r\nthere was no tree in the field, one of these seedlings might be let grow\r\ninto a small tree. Cottonwoods grew very rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe tree that shaded the watchers’ stage in our family field, and which\r\nI have indicated on the map, was about as high as my son Goodbird’s\r\ncabin, and had a trunk about four inches in diameter. The cottonwood\r\ntree standing in Wolf Chief’s corn field this present summer, is perhaps\r\nabout the height of the trees that used to stand in our fields at\r\nLike-a-fishhook village.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation of Sketch of Watchers’ Stage_\r\n\r\nMy son Goodbird has made a sketch, under my direction, of a watchers’\r\nstage (figure 9).\r\n\r\nThe stage was placed close to the tree shading it, about a foot from the\r\ntrunk. Holes for the posts were dug with a long digging stick; and the\r\nposts were set firm, like fence posts.\r\n\r\nThe stage was made nearly square, so that the watchers could sit facing\r\nany side with equal ease. The beams supporting the floor might be laid\r\neast and west, or north and south; but as the tree stood always on the\r\nsouth side of the stage, the floor beams lay always in one of these two\r\nways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9\r\n\r\nRedrawn from sketch by Edward Goodbird.]\r\n\r\nIn the sketch a skin[10] is seen lying on the stage floor. This is a\r\nbuffalo calf skin, folded fur out, to make a seat for the watcher. The\r\nskin might be folded tail to head, or side to side; and sometimes it was\r\nfolded flesh side out. It never hung down over the edges of the stage\r\nfloor, but was folded up neatly to make a kind of cushion. The puncheon\r\nfloor, at best never very smooth, was rather hard to sit upon; and\r\nletting a part of the skin hang down over the side would have been waste\r\nof good cushion material.\r\n\r\nThe three poles on the right of the stage support another calf skin, used\r\nas a shield against the sun. The poles merely rested on the ground; they\r\nwere not thrust into the soil. They could be shifted about with the sun,\r\nso that the watcher had shade in any part of the day.\r\n\r\nThe calf skin used for a sun shade hung on the poles head downward;\r\nwhether it lay fur or flesh side down did not matter.\r\n\r\nSkins dressed by Indians have holes cut along the edges for the wooden\r\npins by which they are staked out on the ground to dry. The poles\r\nupholding the skin shade we cut of willows; and we were careful to trim\r\noff the branches, leaving little stubs sticking out on the trunk of the\r\npole. These little stubs we slipped through some of the holes in the edge\r\nof the skin shade to uphold it and stay it in place. It was not necessary\r\nto bind the skin down with thongs; just slipping the stubs through the\r\nholes was enough.\r\n\r\nPoles for a sun shade were cut indifferently of dry or green wood; and\r\nthey lasted the entire season.\r\n\r\nThe ladder by which we mounted a watchers’ stage rested against either of\r\nthe corners next the tree, against one of the two beams supporting the\r\nfloor; however we did not consider a watchers’ stage to be sacred, and we\r\nplaced the ladder anywhere it might be convenient.\r\n\r\nThe ladder was a cottonwood trunk, cut with three steps; more were not\r\nneeded, as the stage floor was not high.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sweet Grass’s Sun Shade_\r\n\r\nIf the tree sheltering a stage had scant foliage, we often cut thick,\r\nleafy cottonwood boughs and thrust them horizontally through the branches\r\nof the tree to increase its shade. It was a common thing for the watchers\r\nto tie a robe across the face of the tree for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIf no tree grew in the garden, a small cottonwood with thick, leafy\r\nbranches was cut and propped against the south or sunny side of the stage.\r\n\r\nThere was an old woman named Sweet Grass who had no tree in her garden.\r\nShe built a stage just like that in Goodbird’s sketch (figure 9). To\r\nshade it I remember she cut several small cottonwood trees and set them\r\nin holes made with her digging stick, along the south side of her stage.\r\nThey stood there in a row and shaded the stage quite effectively. Her\r\nstage stood rather close to the edge of her garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Watchers_\r\n\r\nThe season for watching the fields began early in August when green corn\r\nbegan to come in; for this was the time when the ripening ears were apt\r\nto be stolen by horses, or birds, or boys. We did not watch the fields in\r\nthe spring and early summer, to keep the crows from pulling up the newly\r\nsprouted grain; such damage we were content to repair by replanting.\r\n\r\nGirls began to go on the watchers’ stage to watch the corn and sing, when\r\nthey were about ten or twelve years of age. They continued the custom\r\neven after they had grown up and married; and old women, working in the\r\ngarden and stopping to rest, often went on the stage and sang.\r\n\r\nTwo girls usually watched and sang together. The village gardens were\r\nlaid out close to one another; and a girl of one family would be joined\r\nby the girl of the family who owned the garden adjoining. Sometimes\r\nthree, or even four, girls got on the stage and sang together; but never\r\nmore than four. A drum was not used to accompany the singing.\r\n\r\nThe watchers sometimes rose and stood upon the stage as they looked to\r\nsee if any boys or horses were in the field, stealing corn. Older girls\r\nand young married women, and even old women, often worked at porcupine\r\nembroidery as they watched. Very young girls did not embroider.\r\n\r\nBoys of nine to eleven years of age were sometimes rather troublesome\r\nthieves. They were fond of stealing green ears to roast by a fire in the\r\nwoods. Sometimes—not every day, however—we had to guard our corn alertly.\r\nA boy caught stealing was merely scolded. “You must not steal here\r\nagain!” we would say to him. His parents were not asked to pay damage for\r\nthe theft.\r\n\r\nWe went to the watchers’ stage quite early in the day, before sunrise, or\r\nnear it, and we came home at sunset.\r\n\r\nThe watching season continued until the corn was all gathered and\r\nharvested. My grandmother, Turtle, was a familiar figure in our family’s\r\nfield, in this season. I can remember her staying out in the field daily,\r\npicking out the ripening ears and braiding them in a string.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Booths_\r\n\r\nThere were a good many booths in the gardens that lay west of the\r\nvillage. Usually a booth stood at one side of every field in which was a\r\nwatchers’ stage.\r\n\r\nTo make a booth, we cut diamond willows, stood them in the ground in a\r\ncircle, and bending over the leafy tops, tied them together. A few leafy\r\nbranches were interwoven into the top to increase the shade; but there\r\nwas no further covering.\r\n\r\nA booth had a floor diameter of nine or ten feet, and was as high as I\r\ncan conveniently reach with my hands—six feet.\r\n\r\nThe girls who sang and watched the ripening corn cooked in these booths.\r\nI often did so when I was a young girl; for cooking at the booth was done\r\nby all the watchers, even young girls of ten or twelve years. I have\r\noften seen my grandmother, Turtle, also, in her booth very early in the\r\nmorning, in the corn season.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eating Customs_\r\n\r\nA meal was eaten sometimes just after sunrise, or a little later; but we\r\nnever had regular meal hours in the field. We cooked and ate whenever\r\nwe got hungry, or when visitors came; or we strayed over to other\r\ngardens and ate with our friends. If relatives came, the watchers often\r\nentertained them by giving them something to eat.\r\n\r\nTo cook the meal a fire was made in the booth. Meat had been brought out\r\nfrom the village, dried or fresh buffalo meat usually. Fresh meat was\r\nlaid on the coals to broil; dried meat was thrust on the end of a stick\r\nthat leaned over the coals; and when one side was well toasted it was\r\nturned over.\r\n\r\nFresh squashes we boiled in clay or iron pots; a good many brass or\r\ncopper kettles also were in use when I was young. We were fond of\r\nsquashes.\r\n\r\nA common dish was green corn and beans. The corn was shelled off the cob\r\nand boiled with green beans that were shelled also; sometimes the beans\r\nwere boiled in the pod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10\r\n\r\nRedrawn from sketch by Goodbird of specimen made by Buffalobird-woman.]\r\n\r\nTo serve the corn and beans we poured the mess into a wooden bowl and ate\r\nwith spoons made from the stems of squash leaves. Figure 10 is a sketch\r\nof such a spoon. The squash stem was split at one end and the split was\r\nheld open by a little stick. Stems of leaves of our native squashes have\r\ntiny prickles on them, but these did not hurt the eater’s lips. Leaf\r\nstems of native squashes I think are firmer and stronger than those of\r\nwhite men’s squashes, such as we now raise.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother, Turtle, was a faithful watcher in our family field in the\r\nwatching season. I remember she used to bring home in the evening all the\r\nuneaten corn she had boiled that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Youths’ and Maidens’ Customs_\r\n\r\nWe always kept drinking water at the stage; and if relatives came out, we\r\nfreely gave them to drink. But boys and young men who came were offered\r\nneither food nor drink, unless they were relatives.\r\n\r\nOur tribe’s custom in such things was well understood.\r\n\r\nThe youths of the village used to go about all the time seeking the\r\ngirls; this indeed was almost all they did. Of course, when the girls\r\nwere on the watchers’ stage the boys were pretty sure to come around.\r\nSometimes two youths came together, sometimes but one. If there were\r\nrelatives at the watchers’ stage the boys would stop and drink or eat;\r\nthey did not try to talk to the girls, but would come around smiling and\r\ntry to get the girls to smile back.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate our custom, if a boy came out to a watchers’ stage, we\r\ngirls that were sitting upon it did not say a word to him. It was our\r\nrule that we should work and should not say anything to him. So we sat,\r\nnot looking at him, nor saying a word. He would smile and perhaps stop\r\nand get a drink of water.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a girl that was not a youth’s sweetheart, never talked to him.\r\nThis rule was observed at all times. Even when a boy was a girl’s\r\nsweetheart, or “love-boy” as we called him, if there were other persons\r\naround, she did not talk to him, unless these happened to be relatives.\r\n\r\nBoys who came out to the watchers’ stage, getting no encouragement from\r\nthe girls there, soon went away.\r\n\r\nA very young girl was not permitted to go to the watchers’ stage unless\r\nan old woman went along to take care of her. In olden days, mothers\r\nwatched their daughters very carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Watchers’ Songs_\r\n\r\nMost of the songs that were sung on the watchers’ stage were love songs,\r\nbut not all.\r\n\r\nOne that little girls were fond of singing—girls that is of about twelve\r\nyears of age—was as follows:\r\n\r\n    You bad boys, you are all alike!\r\n    Your bow is like a bent basket hoop;\r\n    You poor boys, you have to run on the prairie barefoot;\r\n    Your arrows are fit for nothing but to shoot up into the sky!\r\n\r\nThis song was sung for the benefit of the boys who came to the near-by\r\nwoods to hunt birds.\r\n\r\nHere is another song; but that you may understand it I shall first have\r\nto explain to you what ikupa´ means.\r\n\r\nA girl whom another girl loves as her own sister, we call her ikupa´. I\r\nthink your word chum, as you explain it, has about the same meaning. This\r\nis the song:\r\n\r\n    “My ikupa´, what do you wish to see?” you said to me.\r\n    What I wish to see is the corn silk coming out on the growing ear;\r\n    But what _you_ wish to see is that naughty young man coming!\r\n\r\nHere is a song that we sang to tease young men that were going by:\r\n\r\n    You young man of the Dog society, you said to me,\r\n    “When I go to the east on a war party, you will hear news of me how\r\n        brave I am!”\r\n    I have heard news of you;\r\n    When the fight was on, you ran and hid!\r\n    And you think you are a brave young man!\r\n    Behold you have joined the Dog society;\r\n    Therefore, I call you just plain dog!\r\n\r\nThese songs from the watchers’ stage we called mi´daxika, or gardeners’\r\nsongs. The words of these I have just given you we called love-boy words;\r\nand they were intended to tease.\r\n\r\nThere was another class of songs sung from the watchers’ stage that did\r\nnot have love-boy words. I will give you one of these, but to make it\r\nintelligible, I must first explain a custom of my tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clan Cousins’ Custom_\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a woman of the Tsi´stska Doxpa´ka marries a man of\r\nthe Midipa´di clan. Their child will be a Tsi´stska; for we Hidatsas\r\nreckon every child to belong to the clan of his mother; and the members\r\nof the mother’s clan will be clan sisters and clan brothers to her child.\r\n\r\nAnother woman of the tribe, of what clan does not matter, also marries a\r\nMidipa´di husband; and they have a child. The child of the first mother\r\nand the child of the second we reckon as makutsati, or clan cousins,\r\nsince their fathers being of the same clan, are clan brothers.\r\n\r\nIn old times these clan cousins had a custom of teasing one another;\r\nespecially was this teasing common between young men and young women.\r\nFor example, a young man, unlucky in war, might be passing the gardens\r\nand hear some mischievous girl, his clan cousin, singing a song taunting\r\nhim for his ill success. From any one else this would be taken for the\r\ndeepest insult; but seeing that the singer was his clan cousin, the young\r\nman only called out good humoredly, “Sing louder, cousin!”\r\n\r\nI can best explain this custom by telling you a story.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Story of Snake-head-ornament_\r\n\r\nA long time ago, in one of our villages at Knife River, there lived a man\r\nMapuksao´kihec, or Snake-head-ornament. He was a great medicine man; and\r\nin his earth lodge he kept a bull snake, whom he called “father.”\r\n\r\nWhen Snake-head-ornament started to go to a feast he would say to the\r\nbull snake, “Come, father, let us go and get something to eat!”\r\n\r\nThe snake would crawl up the man’s body, coil about his neck and thrust\r\nhis head forward over the man’s crown and forehead; or he would coil\r\nabout the man’s head like the head cloth a hunter used to wear, with his\r\nhead thrust forward as I have said.\r\n\r\nBearing the snake thus on his head, Snake-head-ornament would enter some\r\nman’s lodge and sit down to eat. The snake however never ate with him,\r\nfor his food was not the same as the man’s; the bull snake’s food was\r\nhide scrapings which the women of the lodge fed to him.\r\n\r\nWhen Snake-head-ornament came home again he would say to the bull snake,\r\n“Father, get off.”\r\n\r\nThe snake would creep down from the man’s head, but before he entered\r\nhis hole he would roll himself about on the earth lodge floor.\r\nSnake-head-ornament would say to him, “What are you doing? Do you think I\r\nam bad smelling, and do you want to wash off the smell from your body? It\r\nis you who are bad smelling; yet I do not despise _you_!”\r\n\r\nThe snake, hearing this, would creep into his hole as if ashamed.\r\n\r\nSnake-head-ornament made up a war party and led it against enemies on\r\nthe Yellowstone River. The party not only failed to kill any of the\r\nenemy, but lost three of their own men. This was a kind of disgrace to\r\nSnake-head-ornament; for as leader of the war party he was responsible\r\nfor it. He thought his gods had deserted him; and when he came home he\r\nwent about crying and mourning and calling upon his gods to give him\r\nanother vision. He was a brave man and had many honor marks; and his ill\r\nsuccess made his heart sore.\r\n\r\nIn old times, when one mourned, either man or woman, he cut off his hair,\r\npainted his body with white clay and went without moccasins; he also cut\r\nhimself with some sharp instrument.\r\n\r\nIn those days also, when a man went out to seek his god, he went away\r\nfrom the village, alone, into the hills; and thus it happened that\r\nSnake-head-ornament, on his way to the hills, went mourning and crying\r\npast a garden where sat a woman, his clan cousin, on her watchers’ stage.\r\nSeeing him, she began to sing a song to tease him:\r\n\r\n    He said, “I am a young bird!”\r\n    If a young bird, he should be in a nest;\r\n    But he comes around here looking gray,\r\n    And wanders aimlessly everywhere outside the village!\r\n    He said, “I am a young snake!”\r\n    If a young snake, he should stay in the hills among the red buttes;\r\n    But he comes around here looking gray and crying,\r\n    And wanders aimlessly everywhere!\r\n\r\nWhen the woman sang, “he comes around here looking gray,” she meant that\r\nthe man was gray from the white clay paint on his body.\r\n\r\nSnake-head-ornament heard her song, but knowing she was his clan cousin,\r\ncried out to her:\r\n\r\n“My elder sister, sing louder! You are right; let my fathers hear what\r\nyou say. I do not know whether they will feel shame or not; but the snake\r\nand the white eagle both called me ‘son’!”\r\n\r\nWhat he meant was that the snake and the white eagle were his dream gods;\r\nand that they had both called him “son,” in a vision. In her song the\r\nwoman had taunted him with this. If she had been any one but his clan\r\ncousin, he would have been beside himself with anger. As it was, he kept\r\nhis good humor, and did her no hurt.\r\n\r\nBut the woman had sung her song for a cause. Years before, when\r\nSnake-head-ornament was quite a young man and as yet had won few honors\r\nhe went on a war party and killed a Sioux woman. When he came home he\r\nwas looked upon as a successful warrior; and he was, of course, proud\r\nthat people now looked up to him. Not long after this, he joined the\r\nBlack Mouth society. It happened, one day, that the women were erecting\r\npalisades around the village to defend it, and Snake-head-ornament, as a\r\nmember of the Black Mouths, was one of those overseeing the work. This\r\nwoman, his clan cousin, was rather slow at her task and did not move\r\nabout very briskly. Snake-head-ornament, seeing this, approached her and\r\nfired off his gun close by her legs. She looked around, but seeing that\r\nit was Snake-head-ornament that had shot, and knowing he was her clan\r\ncousin, she did not get angry. Just the same she did not forget; and\r\nyears after she had a good humored revenge in the taunting song I have\r\ngiven you.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN CORN AND ITS USES\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ripening Ears_\r\n\r\nThe first corn was ready to be eaten green early in the harvest moon,\r\nwhen the blossoms of the prairie golden rod are all in full, bright\r\nyellow; or about the end of the first week in August. We ate much green\r\ncorn, boiling the fresh ears in a pot as white people do; but every\r\nHidatsa family also put up dried green corn for winter. This took the\r\nplace with us of the canned green corn we now buy at the trader’s store.\r\n\r\nI knew when the corn ears were ripe enough for boiling from these signs:\r\nThe blossoms on the top of the stalk were turned brown, the silk on the\r\nend of the ear was dry, and the husks on the ear were of a dark green\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nI do not think the younger Indians on this reservation are as good\r\nagriculturists as we older members of my tribe were when we were young. I\r\nsometimes say to my son Goodbird: “You young folks, when you want green\r\ncorn, open the husk to see if the grain is ripe enough, and thus expose\r\nit; but I just go out into the field and pluck the ear. When you open an\r\near and find it too green to pluck, you let it stand on the stalk; and\r\nbirds then come and eat the exposed kernels, or little brown ants climb\r\nup the stalk and eat the ear and spoil it. I do not think you are very\r\ngood gardeners in these days. In old times, when we went out to gather\r\ngreen ears, we did not have to open their faces to see if the grain was\r\nripe enough to be plucked!”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second Planting for Green Corn_\r\n\r\nOur green corn season lasted about ten days, when the grain, though not\r\nyet ripe, became too hard for boiling green.\r\n\r\nTo provide green corn to be eaten late in the season, we used to make a\r\nsecond planting of corn when June berries were ripe; and for this purpose\r\nwe left a space, not very large, vacant in the field. In my father’s\r\nfamily this second planting was of about twenty-eight hills of corn. It\r\ncame ready to eat when the other corn was getting hard; but it often\r\ngot caught by the frost. Nearly every garden owner made such a second\r\nplanting; it was, indeed, a usual practice in the tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cooking Fresh Green Corn_\r\n\r\nOur usual way of cooking fresh, green corn, was to boil it in a kettle on\r\nthe cob.\r\n\r\nFresh, green corn, shelled from the cob, was often put in a corn mortar\r\nand pounded; and then boiled without fats or meat. Prepared thus, it had\r\na sweet taste and smell; much like that of the canned corn we buy of the\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\nShelled green corn, in the whole grain, was also boiled fresh, mixed with\r\nbeans and fats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roasting Ears_\r\n\r\nGreen ears were sometimes roasted, usually by an individual member of\r\nthe family who wanted a little change of diet. The women of my father’s\r\nfamily never prepared a full meal of roasted ears that I remember; if any\r\none wanted roasted, fresh, green corn, he prepared it himself.\r\n\r\nWhen I wanted to roast green corn I made a fire of cottonwood and\r\nprepared a bed of coals. I laid the fresh ear on the coals with the husk\r\nremoved. As the corn roasted, I rolled the ear gently to and fro over the\r\ncoals. When properly cooked I removed the ear and laid on another.\r\n\r\nAs the ear roasted, the green kernels would pop sometimes with quite a\r\nsharp sound. If this popping noise was very loud, we would laugh and say\r\nto the one roasting the ear, “Ah, we see you have stolen that ear from\r\nsome other family’s garden!”\r\n\r\nGreen corn was regularly taken out of the garden to roast until frost\r\ncame, when it lost its fragrance and fresh taste. To restore its\r\nfreshness, we would take the green corn silk of the same plucked ear and\r\nrub the silk well into the kernels of the ear as they stood in the cob.\r\nThis measurably restored the fresh taste and smell.\r\n\r\nWe did not do this if the ear was to be boiled, only if we intended to\r\nroast it.\r\n\r\nFor green corn, boiled and eaten fresh, we used all varieties except the\r\ngummy; for when green they tasted alike. But for roasting ears we thought\r\nthe two yellow varieties, hard and soft, were the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mätu´a-la´kapa_\r\n\r\nA common dish made from green corn was mätu´a-la´kapa, from mätu´a, green\r\ncorn; and la´kapa, mush, or something mushy; thus, wheat flour mixed with\r\nwater to a thick paste we call la´kapa, even if unboiled.\r\n\r\nRipening green corn, with the grain still soft, was shelled off the cob\r\nwith the tip of the thumb or with the thumb nail. The shelled corn was\r\npounded in a mortar and boiled with beans; it was flavored with spring\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corn Bread_\r\n\r\nWe also made a kind of corn bread from green corn.\r\n\r\nGreen ears were plucked and the corn shelled off with the thumb nail, so\r\nas not to break open the kernels. Boiled green corn could be shelled with\r\na mussel shell because boiling toughened the kernels; but unboiled green\r\ncorn was shelled with the thumb nail.\r\n\r\nTwo or three women often worked at shelling the corn as it was rather\r\ntedious work.\r\n\r\nWhen enough of the corn had been shelled, it was put in a corn mortar and\r\npounded.\r\n\r\nSome of the ears were naturally longer than others: a number of these had\r\nbeen selected and their husks removed. Some of these husks were now laid\r\ndown side by side, but overlapping like shingles, until a sheet was made\r\nabout ten inches wide.\r\n\r\nAnother row of husks was laid over the first, transversely to them; and\r\nso until four or five layers of the green husks were made, each lying\r\ntransversely to the layer of husks beneath.\r\n\r\nThe shelled corn, pounded almost to a pulp, was poured out on this husk\r\nsheet, and patted down with the hand to a loaf about seven or eight\r\ninches square, and an inch or two thick. However, this varied; a girl\r\nwould make a much smaller loaf than would a woman preparing a mess for\r\nher family.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the uppermost layer of husks were now folded over the top\r\nof the loaf, leaf by leaf; then the next layer of husks beneath; and so\r\nuntil the ends of all the husks were folded over the top of the loaf,\r\nquite hiding it.\r\n\r\nTwo or three husk leaves had been split into strips half an inch to three\r\nquarters of an inch in width. These strips were tied together to make\r\nbands to bind the loaf. Three bands passed around the loaf each way, or\r\nsix bands in all.\r\n\r\nNo grease nor fat, nor any seasoning, had been added to the loaf; the\r\npounded green corn pulp was all that entered into it.\r\n\r\nThe loaf made, now came the baking. The ashes in the fire place in an\r\nearth lodge lay quite deep. A cavity was dug into these ashes about as\r\ndeep as my hand is long. Into the bottom of this cavity live coals and\r\nhot ashes were raked, and upon these the loaf was laid; a few ashes were\r\nraked over the top, and upon these ashes live coals were heaped. The loaf\r\nbaked in about two hours.\r\n\r\nWe called this loaf naktsi´, or buried-in-ashes-and-baked. Soft white\r\nand soft yellow corn were good varieties from which to make this\r\nburied-and-baked corn, as we called it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying Green Corn for Winter_\r\n\r\nEvery Hidatsa family put up a store of dried green corn for winter. This\r\nis the way in which I prepared my family’s store.\r\n\r\nIn the proper season I went out into our garden and broke off the ears\r\nthat I found, that were of a dark green outside. Sometimes I even broke\r\nopen the husks to see if the ear was just right; but this was seldom, as\r\nI could tell very well by the color and other signs I have described. I\r\nwent all over the garden, plucking the dark green ears, and putting them\r\nin a pile in some convenient spot on the cultivated ground. If I was\r\nclose enough I tossed each ear upon the pile as I plucked it; but as I\r\ndrew further away, I gathered the ears into my basket and bore them to\r\nthe pile.\r\n\r\nI left off plucking when the pile contained five basketfuls if I was\r\nworking alone. If two of us were working we plucked about ten basketfuls.\r\n\r\nGreen corn for drying was always plucked in the evening, just before\r\nsunset; and the newly plucked ears were let lie in the pile all night,\r\nin the open air. The corn was not brought home on the evening of the\r\nplucking, because if kept in the earth lodge over night it would not\r\ntaste so fresh and sweet, we thought.\r\n\r\nThe next morning before breakfast, I went out to the field and fetched\r\nthe corn to our lodge in the village. As I brought the baskets into the\r\nlodge, I emptied them in a pile at the place marked _B_ in figure 11,\r\nnear the fire.\r\n\r\nSitting at _A_, I now began husking, breaking off the husks from each ear\r\nin three strokes, thus: With my hand I drew back half the husk; second, I\r\ndrew back the other half; third, I broke the husk from the cob. The husks\r\nI put in a pile, _E_, to one side. No husking pegs were used, such as you\r\ndescribe to me; I could husk quite rapidly with my bare hands.\r\n\r\nAs the ears were stripped, they were laid in a pile upon some of the\r\ndiscarded husks, spread for that purpose. The freshly husked ears made a\r\npretty sight; some of them were big, fine ones, and all had plump, shiny\r\nkernels. A twelve-row ear we thought a big one; a few very big ears had\r\nfourteen rows of kernels; smaller ears had not more than eight rows.\r\n\r\nTwo kettles, meanwhile, had been prepared. One marked _D_ in figure 11,\r\nwas set upon coals in the fireplace; the other, _C_, was suspended over\r\nthe fire by a chain attached to the drying pole. The kettles held water,\r\nwhich was now brought to a boil.\r\n\r\nWhen enough corn was husked to fill one of these kettles, I gathered\r\nup the ears and dropped them in the boiling water. I watched the corn\r\ncarefully, and when it was about half cooked, I lifted the ears out with\r\na mountain sheep horn spoon and laid them on a pile of husks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11]\r\n\r\nWhen all the corn was cooked, I loaded the ears in my basket and bore\r\nthem out upon the drying stage, where I laid them in rows, side by side,\r\nupon the stage floor. There I left them to dry over night.\r\n\r\nThe work of bringing in the five basketfuls of corn from the field and\r\nboiling the ears took all day, until evening.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the corn was brought into the lodge again. A skin tent\r\ncover had been spread on the floor and the half boiled ears were laid\r\non it, in a pile. I now sat on the floor, as an Indian woman sits, with\r\nankles to the right, and with the edge of the tent cover drawn over my\r\nknees, I took an ear of the half boiled corn in my left hand, holding it\r\nwith the greater end toward me. I had a small, pointed stick; and this\r\nI ran, point forward, down between two rows of kernels, thus loosening\r\nthe grains. The right hand row of the two rows of loosened kernels I now\r\nshelled off with my right thumb. I then shelled off all the other rows of\r\nkernels, one row at a time, working toward the left, and rolling the cob\r\nover toward the right as I did so.\r\n\r\nThere was another way of shelling half boiled corn. As before, I would\r\nrun a sharpened stick down two rows of kernels, loosening the grains; and\r\nI would then shell them off with smart, quick strokes of a mussel shell\r\nheld in my right hand. We still shell half boiled corn in this way, using\r\nlarge spoons instead of shells. There were very few metal spoons in use\r\nin my tribe when I was a girl; mussel shells were used instead for most\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIf while I was shelling the corn, a girl or woman came into the lodge\r\nto visit, she would sit down and lend a hand while we chatted; thus the\r\nshelling was soon done.\r\n\r\nThe shelling finished, I took an old tent cover and spread it on the\r\nfloor of the drying stage outside. On this cover I spread the shelled\r\ncorn to dry, carrying it up on the stage in my basket.\r\n\r\nAt night I covered the drying corn with old tent skins to protect it from\r\ndampness.\r\n\r\nThe corn dried in about four days.\r\n\r\nWhen the corn was well dried, I winnowed it. This I sometimes did on the\r\nfloor of the drying stage, sometimes on the ground.\r\n\r\nHaving chosen a day when a slight wind was blowing, I filled a wooden\r\nbowl from the dried corn that lay heaped on the tent cover; and holding\r\nthe bowl aloft I let the grain pour slowly from it, that any chaff might\r\nbe winnowed out.\r\n\r\nThe corn was now ready to be put in sacks for winter.\r\n\r\nCorn thus prepared we called maada´ckihĕ, from ada´ckihĕ,\r\ntreated-by-fire-but-not-cooked, a word also used to designate food that\r\nhas been prepared by smoking.\r\n\r\nAll varieties of corn could be prepared in this way.[11]\r\n\r\nThe Arikaras on this reservation have a different way of preparing and\r\ndrying green corn. They make a big heap of dried willows, and upon these\r\nlay the ears, green and freshly plucked, in the husk. When all is ready,\r\nthey set fire to the willows, thus roasting the corn; and they often\r\nroast a great pile of corn at one time, in this way. The roasted ears are\r\nhusked and shelled, and the grain dried, for storing. Corn that has been\r\nroasted in the Arikara way, dries much more quickly than that prepared by\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\nOf late years some Mandan and Hidatsa families occasionally roast their\r\ncorn in imitation of the Arikara way; but I never saw this done in my\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nI do not like to eat food made of this dried, roasted corn; it is dirty!\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPË´DI (CORN SMUT)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mapë´di_\r\n\r\nMapë´di is a black mass that grows in the husk of an ear of corn; it is\r\nwhat you say white men call corn smut fungus. Sometimes an ear of corn\r\nappears very plump, or somewhat swelled; and when the husk is opened,\r\nthere is no corn inside, only mapë´di, or smut; or sometimes part of the\r\near will be found with a little grain at one end, and mapë´di at the\r\nother. These masses of mapë´di, or corn smut, that we found growing on\r\nthe ear, we gathered and dried for food.\r\n\r\nThere is another mapë´di that grows on the stalk of the corn. It is not\r\ngood to eat, and was not gathered up at the harvest time. The mapë´di\r\nthat grows on the stalk is commonly found at a place where the stalk, by\r\nsome accident, has been half broken.\r\n\r\nWe looked upon the mapë´di that grew on the corn ear as a kind of corn,\r\nbecause it was borne on the cob; it was found on the ears the grain of\r\nwhich was growing solid, or was about ready to be eaten as green corn. We\r\ndid not find many mapë´di masses in one garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvest and Uses_\r\n\r\nWe gathered the black masses and half boiled and dried them, still on\r\nthe cob. When well dried, they were broken off the cob. These broken off\r\npieces we mixed with the dried half boiled green corn, and stored in the\r\nsame sack with them.\r\n\r\nMapë´di was cooked by boiling with the half-boiled dried corn. We did\r\nnot eat mapë´di fresh from the garden, nor did we cook it separately.\r\nMapë´di, boiled with corn, tasted good, not sweet, and not sour.\r\n\r\nI still follow the custom of my tribe and gather mapë´di each year at the\r\ncorn harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIPE CORN HARVEST\r\n\r\n\r\n_Husking_\r\n\r\nAs the corn in the fields began to show signs of ripening, the people of\r\nLike-a-fishhook village went hunting to get meat for the husking feasts.\r\nThis meat was usually dried; but if a kill was made late in the season,\r\nthe meat was sometimes brought in fresh.\r\n\r\nWhen the corn was fully ripened, the owners of a garden went out with\r\nbaskets, plucked the ears from the stalks and piled them in a heap ready\r\nfor the husking. The empty stalks were left standing in the field.\r\n\r\nA small family sometimes took as many as three days to gather and husk\r\ntheir ripe corn; this was because there were not many persons in the\r\nfamily to do the work.\r\n\r\nIn a big family, like my fathers, harvesting was more speedily done. We\r\nhad a large garden, but we never spent more than one day gathering up the\r\ncorn, which we piled in a heap in the middle of the field.\r\n\r\nThe next day after the corn was plucked, we gave a husking feast. We took\r\nout into the field a great deal of dried meat that my mothers had already\r\ncooked in the lodge; or we took the dried meat into the field and boiled\r\nit in a kettle near the corn pile. We also boiled corn on a fire near by.\r\nThe meat and corn were for the feast.\r\n\r\nInstead of dried meat, a family sometimes took out a side of fresh\r\nbuffalo meat and roasted it over a fire, near the corn pile.\r\n\r\nHaving then arrived at the field, and started a fire for the feast, all\r\nof our family who had come out to work sat down and began to husk. Word\r\nhad been sent beforehand that we were going to give a husking feast, and\r\nthe invited helpers soon appeared. There was no particular time set for\r\ntheir coming, but we expected them in one of the morning hours.[12]\r\n\r\nFor the most part these were young men from nineteen to thirty years of\r\nage, but a few old men would probably be in the company; and these were\r\nwelcomed and given a share of the feast.\r\n\r\nThere might be twenty-five or thirty of the young men. They were paid for\r\ntheir labor with the meat given them to eat; and each carried a sharp\r\nstick on which he skewered the meat he could not eat, to take home.[13]\r\n\r\nThe husking season was looked upon as a time of jollity; and youths and\r\nmaidens dressed and decked themselves for the occasion.\r\n\r\nOf course each young man gave particular help to the garden of his\r\nsweetheart. Some girls were more popular than others. The young men were\r\napt to vie with one another at the husking pile of an attractive girl.\r\n\r\nSome of the young men rode ponies, and when her corn pile had been\r\nhusked, a youth would sometimes lend his pony to his sweetheart for her\r\nto carry home her corn. She loaded the pony with loose ears in bags,\r\nbound on either side of the saddle, or with strings of braided corn laid\r\nupon the pony’s back.\r\n\r\nThe husking season, like the green corn season, lasted about ten days.\r\nThe young men helped faithfully each day, and when they had husked all\r\nthe corn in one field, they moved to another. Thus all the corn piles\r\nwere speedily husked.\r\n\r\nThe husking was always done in the field. We never carried the corn to\r\nthe village to be husked, as the husks would then have dried, and hurt\r\nthe hands of the husker. As we plucked the ears, we piled them in a heap\r\nin the field, to keep the husks moist and soft.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rejecting Green Ears_\r\n\r\nAs the huskers worked they were careful not to add any green ears to\r\nthe husked pile. A green ear would turn black and spoil, and be fit for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nEvery husker knew this; and if a young man was helping another family\r\nhusk, he laid in a little pile beside him, any green ears that he found.\r\nThese green ears belonged to him, to eat or to feed to his pony.\r\n\r\nLast year a white man hired me to gather the corn in his field and husk\r\nit; and I kept all the green ears for myself, for that is my custom. I\r\ndo not know whether that white man liked it or not. It may be he thought\r\nI was stealing that green corn; but I was following the custom that I\r\nlearned of my tribe.\r\n\r\nI am an Indian; if a white man hires me to do work for him, he must\r\nexpect that I will follow Indian custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Braiding Corn_\r\n\r\nMost of the corn as it was husked was tossed into a pile, to be borne\r\nlater to the village. This was true of all the smaller and less favored\r\nears: the best of the larger ears were braided into strings.\r\n\r\nAs we husked, if a long ear of good size and appearance was found, it was\r\nlaid aside for braiding. For this purpose the husk was bent back upon\r\nthe stub of the stalk on the big end of the ear, leaving the three thin\r\nleaves that cling next to the kernels still lying on the ear in their\r\nnatural position. The part of the husk that was bent back was cut off\r\nwith a knife; the three thin leaves that remained were now bent back on\r\nthe ear, and the ear was laid aside. Another ear was treated in the same\r\nway and laid beside the first, also with its thin leaves bent back. And\r\nthus, until a row of ears lay extended side by side upon the ground, all\r\nthe ears lying point forward.\r\n\r\nAnother row was started; and the ears, also lying point forward and\r\nleaned against the first row, were laid so as to cover the thin bent-back\r\nleaves of the first row, to protect them from the sun. As the braiding\r\nwas done with these thin leaves, if they were too dry—as the sun was very\r\napt to make them—they would break.\r\n\r\nWhen a quantity of these ears, all with thin husk leaves bent back, had\r\naccumulated, one of the huskers passed them to someone of the young men,\r\nwho braided them; or one of the women of the family owning the field\r\nmight braid them.\r\n\r\nEven with care the thin leaves were sometimes too dry for the braider to\r\nhandle safely; and he would fill his mouth with water and blow it over\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\nFifty-four or fifty-five ears were commonly braided to a string; but\r\nthe number varied more or less. In my father’s family, we often braided\r\nstrings of fifty-six or fifty-seven ears.\r\n\r\nI do not know why this number was chosen; but I think this number of ears\r\nwas about of a weight that a woman could well carry and put upon the\r\ndrying stage.\r\n\r\nWhen the string was all braided, the braider took either end in his hand,\r\nand placing his right foot against the middle of the string, gave the\r\nends a smart pull. This stretched and tightened the string, and made it\r\nlook neater and more finished; it also tried if there might be any weak\r\nplaces in it.\r\n\r\nWe braided all varieties of corn but two, atạ´ki tso´ki, or hard white,\r\nand tsï´di tso´ki, or hard yellow. These varieties we reckoned too hard\r\nto parch, and for this reason they were not braided. We did, however,\r\nsometimes parch hard yellow to be pounded up into meal for corn balls.\r\n\r\nThe strings of braided corn were borne to the village on the backs of\r\nponies. Some families laid ten strings on a pony; but in my father’s\r\nfamily we never laid on so many, believing it made too heavy a load for\r\nthe poor beast.\r\n\r\nThe braided strings were hung to dry on the drying stage upon the railing\r\nthat lay in the upper forks; and if there was need, poles or drying rods\r\nwere laid across the rails and strings were hung over these also.[15]\r\n\r\nThese drying rods were laid across only where the forks supported the\r\nrails (at the same places the staying thongs were tied), for at these\r\nplaces the stage could better bear the weight of the heavy strings of\r\ncorn; the drying rods were bound at either end to the railing, to stay\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Smaller Ears_\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the smaller and less favored ears were being carried home in\r\nbaskets. It took the members of my father’s family a whole day, and the\r\nnext day following until late in the afternoon, to get this work done.\r\n\r\nEach carrier, as she brought in a basket of corn, ascended the log ladder\r\nof the stage and emptied the corn on the stage floor. Here the corn lay\r\nin a long heap, in the middle of the floor; for a free path was always\r\nleft around the edge for us women; having this path for our use, we did\r\nnot have to tread on the corn as we moved about. Also, if a pony came in\r\nwith a load of braided corn, the heavy strings could be handed up to us\r\nwomen on the stage as we moved around in this free path.\r\n\r\nAs I now remember, our family’s husked corn when piled on the stage\r\nfloor, made a heap about eight yards long and four yards wide, and about\r\nfour feet high in the middle, from which point the pile sloped down on\r\nall sides. This was the loose corn, the smaller ears; and besides these\r\nthere were about one hundred strings of braided corn hung on the railing\r\nabove the heap. I give these measurements, judging as nearly as I can\r\nfrom the size of our drying stage, and from our average yearly corn\r\nyield, when I was a young woman. I think the figures are approximately\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\nFor about eight days the corn lay thus in a long heap upon the stage.\r\nAt the end of that time the ears on the top of the heap had become dry\r\nand smooth and threatened to roll down the sides of the pile. We now\r\ntook drying rods and laid them along the floor against the posts, two or\r\nthree of them, for the whole length of the stage on either side, and on\r\nthe ends of the stage. Planks split from cottonwood trunks were leaned\r\nagainst these drying rods, on the side next the corn. The corn heap\r\nwas now spread evenly over the floor of the drying stage for the depth\r\nof about a foot; the split planks prevented the dry smooth ears from\r\nsliding off the stage. The dry ears had a tendency to roll or slide down\r\nthe sides of the corn pile, as fresh ears did not.\r\n\r\nThis spreading out the corn heap evenly had also the effect of stirring\r\nup the underlying ears and exposing them to the air.\r\n\r\nIf rain fell while the corn was thus drying on the stage, it gave us no\r\nconcern. The corn soon dried again, and no harm was done it.\r\n\r\nThe corn, spread thus in an even heap, took about three more days to dry,\r\nor eleven days in all. Then we began threshing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying the Braided Ears_\r\n\r\nThe strings of braided corn hanging on the rails at the top of the posts\r\nof the drying stage, dried much more quickly than the loose ears heaped\r\non the stage floor. The wind, rattling the dry ears of the strings\r\ntogether, was apt to shell out the drying kernels; it was therefore usual\r\nfor us before threshing time to tie these braids together so that the\r\nwind could not rattle them.\r\n\r\nTo do this I would ascend the ladder and make my way along the edge of\r\nthe stage floor, making places in the corn with my feet as I walked, so\r\nthat my feet would be on the stage floor and not tread on the drying\r\ncorn. I would push ten of the braided strings together on the rail or the\r\ndrying rod on which they hung, and tie them by passing around them a raw\r\nhide thong.\r\n\r\nThese braided strings, bound thus in bundles of ten, hung on the stage\r\nuntil we were ready to store them in the cache pit; and this we could not\r\ndo until we had our main harvest, the loose ears, threshed and ready to\r\nstore also.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED CORN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Selecting the Seed_\r\n\r\nI have said that for braiding corn we chose the longest and finest ears.\r\nIn my father’s family we used to braid about one hundred strings, some\r\nyears less, some years more, as the season had been wet or dry; for\r\nthe yield of fine ears was always less in a dry year. Of these braided\r\nstrings we selected the very best in the spring for seed.\r\n\r\nMy mothers reckoned that we should need five braided strings of soft\r\nwhite, and about thirty ears of soft yellow, for seed. Of ma´ikadicakĕ,\r\nor gummy, we raised a little each year, not much; ten ears of this, for\r\nseed, my mothers thought were a plenty.\r\n\r\nHard white and hard yellow corn, I have said, were not braided, because\r\nnot used for parching. For seed of these varieties, some good ears were\r\ntaken from the drying pile on the corn stage and stored in the cache pit\r\nfor the next year with loose grain of the same variety. The ears were not\r\nput in a sack, but thrown in with the loose grain.\r\n\r\nWhen I selected seed corn, I chose only good, full, plump ears; and I\r\nlooked carefully to see if the kernels on any of the ears had black\r\nhearts. When that part of a kernel of corn which joins the cob is black\r\nor dark colored, we say it has a black heart. This imperfection is caused\r\nby plucking the ear when too green. A kernel with a black heart will not\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nAn ear of corn has always small grains toward the point of the cob, and\r\nlarge grains toward the butt of the ear. When I came to plant corn, I\r\nused only the kernels in the center of the cob for seed, rejecting both\r\nthe small and the large grains of the two ends.\r\n\r\nSeed corn was shelled from the cob with the thumb; we never threshed it\r\nwith sticks. Sometimes we shelled an ear by rubbing it against another\r\near.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Keeping Two Years’ Seed_\r\n\r\nCorn kept for seed would be best to plant the next spring; and it would\r\nbe fertile, and good to plant, the second spring after harvesting. The\r\nthird year the seed was not so good; and it did not come up very well.\r\nThe fourth year the seed would be dead and useless.\r\n\r\nKnowing that seed corn kept good for at least two years, it was my\r\nfamily’s custom to gather enough seed for at least two years, in seasons\r\nin which our crops were good. Some years, in spite of careful hoeing, our\r\ncrops were poor; the ears were small, there was not much grain on them,\r\nand what grain they bore was of poor quality. We did not like to save\r\nseed out of such a crop. Also, frost occasionally destroyed our crop, or\r\nmost of it.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we had a year of good crops, we put away seed enough to\r\nlast for two years; then, if the next year yielded a poor crop, we still\r\nhad good seed to plant the third season.\r\n\r\nIn my father’s family we always observed this custom of putting away seed\r\nfor two years; and we did this not only of our corn, but of our squash\r\nseeds, beans, sunflower seeds, and even of our tobacco seeds; for if I\r\nremember rightly, the tobacco fields were sometimes injured by frost just\r\nas were our corn fields.\r\n\r\nNot all families in our village were equally wise. Some were quite\r\nimprovident, and were not at all careful to save seed from their crops.\r\nSuch families, in the spring, had to buy their seed from families that\r\nwere more provident.\r\n\r\nSaving a good store of seed was therefore profitable in a way. In my\r\nfather’s family we often sold a good deal of seed in the spring to\r\nfamilies that wanted. The price was one tanned buffalo skin for one\r\nstring of braided seed corn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corn stage of Butterfly’s wife\r\n\r\nThis stage lacks railings, and is floored Arikara fashion with a willow\r\nmat. A pile of drying corn is seen on the stage floor. In the ancient\r\nvillages, where the lodges were crowded together, the railings were\r\nalways present.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Owl Woman pounding corn into meal in a corn mortar]\r\n\r\nEven to-day, families on this reservation come to me to buy seed corn and\r\nseed beans. A handful of beans, enough for one planting, I sell for one\r\ncalico—enough calico, that is, to make an Indian woman a dress, or about\r\nten yards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRESHING CORN\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Booth_\r\n\r\nThe threshing season was always a busy one, for all the families of the\r\nvillage would be threshing their corn at the same time.\r\n\r\nCorn was threshed in a booth, under the drying stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12\r\n\r\nThe figure has been redrawn from sketches by Goodbird. The original is\r\na stage now standing on the reservation, but with mat of willows for\r\nfloor; to this Goodbird added a threshing booth as he saw used by his\r\ngrandmother when he was a boy. Goodbird’s sketches are closely followed,\r\nexcepting that the floor of slabs is restored. The figure tallies in\r\nevery respect with Buffalobird-woman’s description, and the model made by\r\nher for the American Museum of Natural History.]\r\n\r\nTo make the booth, I began with the section at one end of the stage. As\r\nis shown in figure 12, on the posts _A_ and _D_, and _B_ and _C_, were\r\nbound two poles, _e_ and _f_, at about two feet below the stage floor;\r\nupon these were bound two other poles, _g_ and _h_; the poles _e_, _f_,\r\nand _h_ were bound outside of the posts that supported them.\r\n\r\nA long raw hide thong was used for the corner ties. The first pole was\r\nraised in position and bound firmly to the post; and if a second pole was\r\nto be laid over the first—as was done at two of the corners—the thong was\r\ndrawn up and made to bind it also to the post. We always kept a number of\r\nthese raw hide thongs in the lodge against just such uses as this; they\r\nwere strong, and served every purpose of ropes; we oiled them to keep\r\nthem soft.\r\n\r\nA tent cover was now fetched out of the lodge. Tents were of different\r\nsizes, from those of seven, to those of sixteen buffalo cow hides. A\r\nwoman used whatever sized tent cover she owned; but a cover of thirteen\r\nskins was of convenient size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13]\r\n\r\nAround the curved bottom of the tent cover was a row of holes, through\r\nwhich wooden pins were driven to peg the tent to the ground. The tent\r\ncover was bound to the four over-hanging poles, inside of the four posts,\r\nby means of a long thong woven in and out through the holes, as shown in\r\nfigure 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14]\r\n\r\nBound thus to the poles, and quite enclosing the space within them, the\r\ntent cover made a kind of booth. The upper parts of the cover, including\r\nthe smoke flaps, that now hung sweeping the ground, were drawn in and\r\nspread flat on the ground to make a floor for the booth; and stones laid\r\nupon them weighted the cover against the wing.\r\n\r\nIn figure 12 the four posts, _A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_, enclose one section\r\nof the drying stage; the booth did not enclose the whole ground space of\r\nthis section, but about three fifths of it.\r\n\r\nFigure 14, I think, will explain the arrangement of the booth. The\r\nend corners, _X_ and _Y_, were bound to opposite posts, _M_ and _N_,\r\nrespectively, the lapping edges, at _O_, forming a door through which\r\nthe threshers entered the booth; _P_ and _P´_ were bound to posts at _p_\r\nand _p´_; the final corner, _M_, was left untied until the threshers had\r\nentered and were ready to begin their task. (Compare with figure 12, in\r\nwhich, however, the posts are differently lettered.)\r\n\r\nBefore they did this they went above and removed the planks and drying\r\nrods laid around the edge of the stage floor, and pushed the corn back\r\ntoward the middle of the floor into a long heap again, that it might not\r\nfall over the edge, now that the planks were taken away. One of the floor\r\nplanks was now removed, at _R_. Through the aperture thus made, corn was\r\npushed down to left and right of _R_; this was continued until there was\r\na pile of corn just under the aperture, and running the width of the\r\nbooth, about eighteen or twenty inches high.\r\n\r\nThe threshers now entered the booth and tied the corner at _M_, closing\r\nthe door. In my father’s family there were usually three threshers,\r\nwomen; and they sat in a row on the floor of the booth, facing the pile\r\nof corn. Each woman had a stick for a flail, with which she beat the corn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15]\r\n\r\nFlails were of ash or cottonwood. An ash flail would be about three\r\nand a half feet long and from three quarters of an inch to an inch in\r\ndiameter, and was cut green. A cottonwood flail was seldom used green;\r\nand as it was therefore lighter than the green ash, a cottonwood flail\r\nwas a little greater in diameter, but of the same length. We were careful\r\nthat a flail should not be too heavy, lest it break the kernels in the\r\nthreshing. Kinikinik sticks were sometimes used for flails.\r\n\r\nA diagram (figure 15) has been drawn to illustrate how I worked in a\r\nthreshing booth when I was a young woman. As shown, I sat on the extreme\r\nleft; one of my mothers and my sister sat as indicated, on my right. More\r\nthan three seldom worked in a threshing booth at the same time, at least\r\nin our family; however, I have known my sister, Not-frost, to make a\r\nfourth. I have even known five to be threshing in the booth of some other\r\nfamily in the village, but never more than five.\r\n\r\nTo thresh the corn, I raised my flail and brought it down smartly, but\r\nnot severely, upon the pile of corn. The grain as it was thus beaten off\r\nthe dry cobs would fall by its own weight into the pile, and work its way\r\nto the bottom; while the lighter cobs would come to the top of the pile.\r\n\r\nBeating the ears with the flails caused many of the kernels to leap and\r\nfly about; but the tent cover, enclosing the booth, caught all these\r\nflying kernels. It was, indeed, for this that the booth was built.\r\n\r\nAs the cobs, beaten empty of grain, accumulated on the pile, we drew them\r\noff and cast them out of the door of the booth upon a tent cover, spread\r\nto receive them, under the middle section of the stage. Many of these\r\ncobs had a few small grains clinging to them; and these must be saved,\r\nfor we wasted nothing.\r\n\r\nHaving paused then to throw out the cobs, we returned to the pile and\r\nthrust our flails in under it, drawing them upward through the corn, thus\r\nworking the unthreshed ears to the top. As much as we could, we tried\r\nto keep the unthreshed ears in the middle of the pile, and the threshed\r\ngrain pushed to right and left, as will be seen by studying the diagram.\r\nTo thresh one pile, or filling of corn in a booth, took a half day’s work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order of the Day’s Work_\r\n\r\nOur habit was to begin quite early in the morning, enclose the booth with\r\nthe tent cover, and set to work threshing; finishing the first filling,\r\nor pile, about midday. In the afternoon we began a second pile, first\r\nheaping the already threshed grain to right and left, and behind the\r\nthreshers.\r\n\r\nI have said that on the ground under the second section of the stage, a\r\nsecond tent cover was spread to catch the cobs. A part of this tent cover\r\nwas drawn in under the edge of the booth to help carpet the floor of the\r\nbooth.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day we turned our attention to the pile of cobs; and\r\nwith our thumbs we shelled off every grain that clung to the cobs. From\r\nthe cobs of a day’s threshing we collected about as many grains of corn\r\nas would fill a white man’s hat. This was taken into the booth and thrown\r\non the pile of threshed grain.\r\n\r\nWe now disposed of the grain for the night. If we had gotten through\r\nthreshing rather early in the day, we bore the newly threshed grain in\r\nbaskets into the lodge, and emptied it into a bull boat.\r\n\r\nIf we had gotten through our threshing rather late in the day, we made\r\nthe door of the booth tight, and left the grain on the booth floor\r\nthroughout the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cobs_\r\n\r\nThe day’s threshing over, we attended to the cobs. I have said that we\r\nshelled off any kernels that clung to them after threshing, so that they\r\nwere now quite clean of grain.\r\n\r\nAll day long, as we threshed, we had watched that no horses got at the\r\ncobs to trample and nibble them, or that any dog ran over them, or any\r\nchildren played in them. Then, in the evening, if the weather was fine,\r\nand there was little wind, one of my mothers or I carried the cobs\r\noutside of the village to a grassy place and heaped them in a pile about\r\nfive feet high. A pile of cobs of such a height I usually gathered from a\r\nday’s threshing.\r\n\r\nIn our prairie country, on a fair day, the wind usually dies down about\r\nsunset; and now, when the air was still, I fired the cob pile. As the\r\npile began to burn, I could usually see the burning cob piles of two or\r\nthree other families lighting up the gathering dusk.\r\n\r\nI had to stay and watch the fire, to keep any mischievous boys from\r\ncoming to play in the burning heap. Children of from ten to fifteen years\r\nof age were quite a pest at cob-firing time. They had a kind of game\r\nthey were fond of playing. Each would cut a long, flexible, green stick,\r\nand at the edge of the Missouri he would get a ball of wet mud and stick\r\nit on his stick. He would try to approach one of the burning piles, and\r\nwith his stick, slap the mud ball smartly into the burning coals, some of\r\nwhich, still glowing, would stick in the wet mud. Using the stick as a\r\nsling, the child would throw the mud ball into the air, aiming often at\r\nanother child. Other children would be throwing mud balls at one another\r\nat the same time, and these, with the bits of glowing charcoal clinging\r\nto them, would go sailing through the air like shooting stars. Knowing\r\nvery well that the children would get into my burning cobs if I even\r\nturned my back, I was careful to stay by to watch.\r\n\r\nAt last the fire had burned down and the coals were dead; and nothing was\r\nleft but a pile of ashes. It was now night, and I would go home. Early\r\nthe next morning, before the prairie winds had arisen, I would go out\r\nagain to my ash heap. On the top of the ashes, if nothing had disturbed\r\nthem in the night and an unexpected wind had not blown them about, I\r\nwould find a thin crust had formed. This crust I carefully broke and\r\ngathered up with my fingers, squeezing the pieces in my hand into little\r\nlumps, or balls. Sometimes I was able to gather four or five of these\r\nlittle balls from one pile of ashes; but never more than five.\r\n\r\nThese balls I carried home. There were always several baskets hanging in\r\nthe lodge, ready for any use we might want of them; and it was our habit\r\nto keep some dried buffalo heart skins, or some dried buffalo paunch\r\nskins, in the lodge, for wrappers, much as white families keep wrapping\r\npaper in the house. The ash balls I wrapped up in one of these skins,\r\ninto a package, being careful not to break the balls. I put the package\r\nin one of the baskets, to hang up until there was occasion for its use.\r\n\r\nThese ash balls were used for seasoning. I have explained elsewhere how\r\nwe used spring salt to season our boiled corn; and that every day in the\r\nlodge, we ate mä´dạkạpa, or pounded dried ripe corn boiled with beans.\r\nBut in the fall, instead of seasoning this dish with spring salt, or\r\nalkali salt as you call it, we preferred to use this seasoning of ash\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\nIn my father’s family, for each meal of mä´dạkạpa we filled the corn\r\nmortar three times, two-and-a-half double handfuls of corn making one\r\nfilling of the mortar. Each time we filled the mortar, we dropped in with\r\nthe corn a little of the ash crust, a bit about as big as a white child’s\r\nmarble. Finally, a piece about as big, or perhaps a little larger, was\r\nalso dropped into the boiling pot.\r\n\r\nWe Indians were fond of this seasoning; and we liked it much better than\r\nwe did our spring salt. We did not use spring salt, indeed, if we had ash\r\nballs in the lodge.\r\n\r\nWe called these ash balls mä´dạkạpa isĕ´pĕ, or mä´dạkạpa darkener.\r\n\r\nWe did not make ash balls if the dogs or horses had trampled on the cobs;\r\nor if children had mussed in the fire; nor would we make ash balls if the\r\nday had not been rather calm, for a high wind was sure to blow dust into\r\nthe cobs.\r\n\r\nWe burned cobs and collected ash balls after every threshing day, unless\r\nhindered by storm or high wind. But even if the harvest was a good one,\r\nthe ash balls that we got from the burned cobs for seasoning never lasted\r\nlong. We were so fond of seasoning our food with them that every family\r\nhad used up its store before the autumn had passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Winnowing_\r\n\r\nI have said that after the day’s threshing we stored the newly threshed\r\ngrain for the night, either in the booth or in a bull boat in the earth\r\nlodge; and that we then fired the cobs that had accumulated during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we spread an old tent cover outside the lodge, near\r\nthe drying stage; and we fetched the loose grain of the previous day’s\r\nthreshing out of the booth, or the earth lodge and spread it evenly and\r\nthinly upon the tent cover. The grain was here left to dry until evening.\r\n\r\nA little before sunset, and before the prairie wind had died down, we\r\nfetched baskets and winnowed the grain. The basket was half filled with\r\ngrain, held aloft, and the grain poured gently out in the wind. Wooden\r\nbowls were often used for winnowing, instead of baskets; but they did not\r\nhold as much grain.\r\n\r\nThe winnowing over, I would take up a few grains of the corn to test with\r\nmy teeth. If, when I bit a kernel in two, it broke with a sharp, snappy\r\nsound, I knew it was quite dried; if it broke dull and soft, I knew the\r\ngrain needed another day’s drying; but at the most, this second day’s\r\ndrying was enough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16]\r\n\r\nThe winnowed grain, now well dried, was borne into the earth lodge and\r\nstored temporarily in bull boats. In the diagram (figure 16), is shown\r\nwhere the bull boats full of grain used to stand in my father’s lodge.\r\nSome years our harvest filled three bull boats of threshed grain; some\r\nyears it filled five. In the year illustrated by this diagram, there were\r\nthree bull boats standing between the planks at the left of the door, and\r\nthe fire; and two bull boats on the other side of the fire, all full of\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe threshed grain, I have said, received its final drying and winnowing\r\nupon a tent cover (or covers) spread on the ground near the earth lodge.\r\nIt was my own habit always to spread these tent covers beside the drying\r\nstage on the side farthest away from the lodge. However, the particular\r\nspot where the winnowing was done, was determined by the convenience of\r\nthe household.\r\n\r\nWe did not usually thresh consecutive days. We threshed one day; dried\r\nthe grain and winnowed it the second; and threshed again the third day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Removing the Booth_\r\n\r\nDuring these days the booth did not remain always in one place. When the\r\ncorn on the floor of the first section had all been threshed, the booth\r\nwas removed to another section. I will now explain how this was done.\r\n\r\nIn figure 17 my son has diagramed the floor plan of my mothers’ stage and\r\nthreshing booth, as I remember them.\r\n\r\nThe stage stands in front of Small Ankle’s lodge, which faces toward the\r\nwest. The stage is divided into three sections, _A_, _B_, _C_. The posts\r\nupon which the floor of the stage rests are _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _h_, _i_,\r\n_j_, _k_.\r\n\r\nThe booth was first raised under section _A_, based upon _fg_ and\r\nenclosing ground space _lmfg_.\r\n\r\nSometimes we got up early, bound the poles to the posts and erected our\r\nbooth before breakfast; then after we had eaten, three or four of us\r\nwould go out to thresh, one first going up to push down the corn. She\r\nraised a plank along the side, _fg_, just within the booth; this, if the\r\ndoor of the booth was on the side _lm_. The corn on the floor of the\r\nstage in section _A_ was then shoved down as wanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17\r\n\r\nGround plan of earth lodge here accompanies that of stage to show\r\nrelative positions of the two structures. The stage always stood, as\r\nhere, directly before the lodge entrance. The figures are drawn to scale.]\r\n\r\nThe corn pushed down for one threshing, made a pile running the width of\r\nthe booth, and about forty inches wide and twenty inches high. When the\r\npile was threshed one of the women went up and shoved down another pile.\r\nThe corn in one section was threshed in about three such piles.\r\n\r\nSometimes, if we worked hard and had plenty of help, we threshed one\r\nwhole section in one day; but the beating, beating, beating of the corn\r\nwas hard work, and we more often stopped when wearied and rested until\r\nthe next day. I have already said that we often spent the next day at the\r\nlighter work of drying and winnowing.\r\n\r\nWhen the corn in section _A_ was all threshed, the booth was moved over\r\nunder the floor of section _B_, enclosing _fgno_; and again a plank was\r\ntaken up to let down the corn. Now this plank was always taken up above\r\nthe side of the booth opposite the door; and the door was always placed\r\ndown wind. Thus, if the wind was from the north, the door would be placed\r\non the south side of the booth, and the plank was taken up on the north\r\nside, just within the booth. Corn was always threshed in the booth on the\r\nside opposite the door.\r\n\r\nSections _A_ and _B_ of my mothers’ stage, as shown in diagram (figure\r\n17) contained only yellow corn. Section _C_, or a part of it, contained\r\nwhite corn. Braided strings of corn were also hung all around the railing\r\nabove, but these were not to be threshed.\r\n\r\nSection _B_ having been threshed, the booth was removed to section _C_,\r\nenclosing _hiqp_. I have said that this section had white corn. Now this\r\nwhite corn was piled toward the south end of the stage; and between it\r\nand the yellow corn was left a narrow vacant place on the floor. Above\r\nthis vacant place, meat was often dried; but this meat was removed when\r\nwe were ready to thresh.\r\n\r\nPlacing the booth to enclose _hiqp_, directly under the vacant place,\r\nmade it easy for us to raise a plank here to push down the white corn. If\r\nwe had placed the booth on the south end of this section, we should have\r\nhad to dig into the corn piled here, in order to raise a plank.\r\n\r\nOur family’s threshing lasted about five days in a year of good yield; if\r\nthe year was a poor one, threshing lasted only two or three days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Threshing Braided Corn_\r\n\r\nThe strings of braided corn were stored in the cache pit (which I will\r\ndescribe later) in the whole ear. If, during the winter, or the following\r\nspring, I wanted to thresh a string of braided corn, I put the whole\r\nstring into a skin sack; and this sack I beat and shook, turning it over\r\nand around until all the grain had fallen off the cobs. The sack was then\r\nemptied.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amount of Harvest_\r\n\r\nOur harvested corn, in a good year, lasted my father’s family until the\r\nnext harvest, with a small quantity even then unused. Some years we ran\r\nout of corn before the harvest came, but not often. We ate our corn as\r\nlong as it lasted, not husbanding it toward the last, because we knew\r\nthere were elk and buffalo and antelope to be had for the hunting. If we\r\nran out of corn at all, it was about the first of August; sometimes a\r\nlittle earlier. Sometimes when we had eaten all our last year’s harvest\r\nthere was a small quantity from the previous season’s harvest with which\r\nwe eked out our shortage.\r\n\r\nMy mothers, however, were industrious women, and our shortage, if any,\r\nwas never for long. Some families, not very provident, had consumed all\r\ntheir harvest as early as in the spring; but such never happened in my\r\nfather’s family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sioux Purchasing Corn_\r\n\r\nThe Standing Rock Sioux used to buy corn of us, coming up in midsummer,\r\nor autumn. They came not because they were in need of food, but because\r\nthey liked to eat our corn, and had always meat and skins to trade to us.\r\nFor one string of braided corn they gave us one tanned buffalo robe.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF CORN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of Varieties_\r\n\r\nWe raised nine well marked varieties of corn in our village. Following\r\nare the names of the varieties:\r\n\r\n    Atạ´ki tso´ki                 Hard white\r\n    (White hard)\r\n\r\n    Atạ´ki                        Soft white\r\n    (White)\r\n\r\n    Tsï´di tso´ki                 Hard yellow\r\n    (Yellow hard)\r\n\r\n    Tsï´di tapa´                  Soft yellow\r\n    (Yellow soft)\r\n\r\n    Ma´ïkadicakĕ                  Gummy\r\n    (Gummy)\r\n\r\n    Do´ohi                        Blue\r\n    (Blue)\r\n\r\n    Hi´ci cĕ´pi                   Dark red\r\n    (Red dark)\r\n\r\n    Hi´tsiica                     Light red\r\n    (Light-red)\r\n\r\n    Atạ´ki aku´ hi´tsiica         Pink top\r\n    (White, kind of light red)\r\n\r\nOur Hidatsa word for corn is ko´xati; but in speaking of any variety of\r\ncorn, the work ko´xati is commonly omitted. In like manner, atạ´ki means\r\nwhite; but if one went into a lodge and asked for “atạ´ki” it was always\r\nunderstood to mean soft white corn.\r\n\r\nOf the nine varieties, the atạ´ki, or soft white, was the kind most\r\nraised in our village. The ma´ïkadicakĕ, or gummy, was least raised, as\r\nalmost its only use was in making corn balls.\r\n\r\nIn my father’s family, we raised two kinds of corn, tsï´di tso´ki, or\r\nhard yellow; and atạ´ki, or soft white.\r\n\r\nThe names of the varieties suggest pretty well their characteristics. The\r\natạ´ki aku´ hi´tsiica, or white-with-light-red, was marked by a light red\r\nor pink color toward the top or beard end of the ear. The name pink-top\r\nwhich you suggest for this variety will, I think, do for an English name,\r\nif the literal translation of the Indian term is, as you say, rather\r\nclumsy.\r\n\r\nWe planted each variety of corn separately. We Indians understood\r\nperfectly the need of keeping the strains pure, for the different\r\nvarieties had not all the same uses with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Corn Travels_\r\n\r\nWe Indians knew that corn can travel, as we say; thus, if the seed\r\nplanted in one field is of white corn, and that in an adjoining field is\r\nof some variety of yellow corn, the white will travel to the yellow corn\r\nfield, and the yellow to the white corn field.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you do not understand what I mean by corn traveling. Well, let us\r\nsuppose that there are two fields lying side by side, the one in yellow,\r\nthe other in white corn. When the corn of the two fields is ripe, and the\r\nears are opened, it will be found that many of the ears in the yellow\r\nrows that stand nearest the white field will have white kernels standing\r\nin the cob; also, in the rows of white corn that stand nearest the yellow\r\nfield, there will be many ears with yellow kernels mixed in with the\r\nwhite kernels.\r\n\r\nWe Indians did not know what power it was that causes this. We only knew\r\nthat it was so. We also knew that when a field stands alone, away from\r\nother fields, and is planted with white corn, it will grow up in white\r\ncorn only; there will not be any yellow grains in the ears. And so of any\r\nother variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18]\r\n\r\nSometimes two women, owning adjoining fields, would make an agreement;\r\nthey would divide their fields into sections and plant the corresponding\r\nsections on opposite sides of the division line alike. Thus in the\r\ndiagram (figure 18), _A_ and _A´_ may be planted in a variety of yellow\r\ncorn; _B_ and _B´_ may be planted in beans and squashes; and _C_ and _C´_\r\nmay be planted in a variety of white corn; but even this did not make so\r\nvery much difference; still the corn traveled.\r\n\r\nWe thought that perhaps the reason of this was that the ground here was\r\nsoft, or mellowed and broken by cultivation. We thought corn could not\r\ntravel readily over hard, or unbroken ground; and as you notice in the\r\ndiagram, although the two patches of yellow corn are separated from the\r\nwhite corn by the two patches of squashes and beans, yet the beans and\r\nsquashes are in soft, or cultivated ground. We thought corn traveled more\r\neasily over soft ground.\r\n\r\nHowever, we really did not know what made corn travel; we just knew that\r\nit did.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF THE VARIETIES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Atạ´ki Tso´ki_\r\n\r\nI think that perhaps at first, there was but one variety of corn, atạ´ki\r\ntso´ki, or hard white; and that all other varieties have sprung from\r\nit. I know that when we plant hard white seed, ears often develop that\r\nshow color in the grain. Sometimes ears are produced bearing pink grains\r\ntoward the beard end of the cob; such ears we call i´puta (top) hi´tsiica\r\n(pink); that is, pink top, or light-red top. In color these ears differed\r\nin no wise from atạ´ki aku´ hi´tsiica.\r\n\r\nHard white was very generally raised, nearly every family in the tribe\r\nhaving a field of it.\r\n\r\nThere were two chief dishes chiefly prepared from hard white corn; these\r\nI will now describe.\r\n\r\n_Mäpi´ Nakapa´._ I put water in a pot, and in this I dropped a section\r\nof a string of dried squash, with some beans. Dried squash was always\r\nstrung on long grass strings; and having, from one of these strings, cut\r\noff a piece I tied the ends together, making a wreath, or ring, four or\r\nfive inches in diameter. It was this ring of dried squash slices that I\r\ndropped into the pot. When well boiled, I lifted the squash slices out\r\nby the string and dropped them into a wooden bowl, where I mashed them\r\nand chopped them fine with a horn spoon. The mashed squash I dropped back\r\ninto the kettle again, with the beans; the now empty string I threw away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile corn had been parched, and some buffalo fats had been held over\r\nthe coals on a stick, to roast. The parched corn and roast fats I pounded\r\ntogether in the corn mortar; and the pounded mass I stirred into the\r\nkettle. The mess was now ready to be eaten.\r\n\r\nThis dish we called mäpi´-nakapa´, or pounded-meal mush; from mäpi,´\r\nsomething pounded, and nakapa´, mush, something mushy.\r\n\r\nThe dish was especially a morning meal; after eating it we started to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n_Mä´nakapa._ A second way of preparing hard white corn was as follows: I\r\npounded the corn in a mortar to a meal, but without first parching it.\r\nMost of this meal was fine, but there were many coarser bits in it, some\r\nof them as big as quarter grains of corn.\r\n\r\nWater was put in a kettle; I added the pounded meal, and when it boiled\r\nput in beans. No fats were added.\r\n\r\nAs the mess boiled. I stirred it with a wooden paddle to prevent\r\nscorching; I did not stir with a horn spoon as the hot water softened and\r\nspoiled the horn.\r\n\r\nWhen well boiled, the mess was served.\r\n\r\nWe called this dish mä´nakapa´.[16]\r\n\r\nA seasoning of spring salt, as we called it, was often added. A small\r\npalmful of the salt was mixed with a little water in a horn spoon; this\r\ndissolved the salt and let the sand and dirt drop to the bottom. The\r\ndissolved salt was poured off through the fingers, held to the mouth of\r\nthe horn spoon; this strained out the sand and dirt. The salt turned the\r\nmush slightly yellow.\r\n\r\nAs the soft mush boiled up in the cooking, we were fond of dipping a horn\r\nspoon into it, and licking off the back of the spoon. This was especially\r\na children’s habit.\r\n\r\nAlso at morning and evening meals we ate hard white corn parched and\r\nmixed with fats; or mạdạpo´zi i’ti´a, boiled whole corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Atạ´ki_\r\n\r\nThis is a soft, or as you call it, a flour corn, and was perhaps the\r\nfavorite variety grown by us. The word atạ´ki means white; but when\r\napplied to corn we translate soft white, to distinguish from atạ´ki\r\ntso´ki, or hard white.\r\n\r\nThe use of atạ´ki, or soft white, was very general, since it could be\r\nmade into almost every kind of corn food used by us. “It is the one\r\nvariety,” we used to say, “that can be used in any and every way.”\r\n\r\nSoft white corn, parched and pounded into a meal, was boiled with squash\r\nand beans to make mäpi´ nakapa´. The unparched grain was pounded for meal\r\nto make mä´nakapa; but although good, we did not think the mush made from\r\nsoft white meal was as good as that from the hard white corn meal.\r\n\r\n_Boiled Corn Ball._ A less frequent dish made from soft white corn was\r\nboiled corn balls; it was made only from the dried ripe grain.\r\n\r\nI pounded a quantity of grain into meal, and poured the meal into a pot\r\nhaving hot water—but not too much water—stirring it well about. I now\r\nlifted out some of the mass into my left palm and patted it down with my\r\nright, making a cake about as big around as a baking powder biscuit, but\r\nnot so thick. This cake I dropped into a pot of boiling water, where it\r\nsank to the bottom. I continued until the pot was full, or until I had\r\nall I wished to cook.\r\n\r\nNo salt or other seasoning was added.\r\n\r\nAs the pot boiled, one could see the corn cakes move around in the water;\r\nbut they never floated, nor did they break apart. The boiling lasted\r\nabout an hour.\r\n\r\nIn olden days we ate these corn balls alone; now we more often eat them\r\nwith coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tsï´di Tso´ki and Tsï´di Tapä´_\r\n\r\nThe two varieties of tsï´di, or golden yellow corn, could be pounded and\r\nboiled to make mush, or mä´dakapa; or they could be boiled whole, to make\r\nmạdạpo´zi i’ti´a.\r\n\r\n_Mạdạpo´zi I’ti´a._ For this dish I put the shelled ripe grain, with\r\nfats, in a pot and boiled them until I saw the kernels break open; then I\r\nadded beans, and when these were boiled, the mess was served. This dish\r\nwe called mạdạpo´zi i’ti´a. I do not know the derivation of mạdạpo´zi;\r\ni’ti´a means large. I think you can translate “corn boiled whole.”\r\n\r\nHard yellow and soft yellow corn, roasted in the green ear, tasted sweet,\r\nas if a little sugar were in them. Especially was this true at the time\r\nwhen kernels were beginning to turn yellow. At this time each kernel\r\nshows a little yellow spot on the very top. For this reason this season\r\nwas called tsi´dotsxĕ, or yellow-drop time; for the little yellow spot\r\nlooked like a drop on the top of the kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Soft Varieties_\r\n\r\nDo´ohi, or blue, hi´ci cĕ´pi, dark red, and hi´tsiica, light red, were\r\nall soft corns and were cooked and prepared and stored just like atạ´ki;\r\nthese four varieties tasted exactly alike, if cooked in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ma´ikadicakĕ_\r\n\r\nMa´ikadicakĕ, or gummy corn, is of different colors; some is of a light\r\nred; some yellow flaked with red; and some is in color like hard white;\r\nbut all these slightly differing strains are alike in this, that when\r\nthe kernels dry they shrink up and become rough, or wrinkled. The name,\r\nma´ikadicakĕ, comes from kadi´cakĕ, or gum-like.\r\n\r\nMa´ikadicakĕ was the least grown of our five principal varieties of corn;\r\nhowever, a good deal of this variety is still raised on this reservation.\r\n\r\nMa´ikadicakĕ was sometimes roasted green, when the kernels chewed up\r\ngummy in the mouth; but the one recognized use of this variety was to\r\nmake corn balls.\r\n\r\n_Mä´pĭ Mĕĕ´pĭ I’´kiuta_, or _Corn Balls_. Into a clay pot while yet\r\ncold, I put shelled corn and set it on the fire. As the grain parched, I\r\nstirred it with a stick. The heat made the kernels pop open somewhat, but\r\nnot much.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile fats were roasted over the coals on the point of a stick; and\r\nthese and the parched grain were dropped into the corn mortar and pounded\r\ntogether. I then reached into the mortar and took out a handful of the\r\nmeal, which being oily with the fats, held together in a lump. This lump\r\nI squeezed in my fingers and then tapped it gently on the edge of the\r\nmortar, making a slight dent or groove, lengthwise, in one side of the\r\nlump. The lump or ball—it was not exactly round—I dropped into a wooden\r\nbowl. The process was repeated until the bowl was full.\r\n\r\nOur native name for corn ball is mä´pi mĕĕ´pĭ i’´kiuta, from mä´pi,\r\nsomething pounded, mĕĕ´pĭ, mortar, and i’´kiuta, hit or pressed against;\r\nthat is pounded meal pressed against the mortar; but we translate, just\r\ncorn ball.\r\n\r\nCorn balls were an acceptable present for a woman to give her daughter to\r\ntake to her husband; the son-in-law might himself eat the corn balls, or\r\nshare them with his parents or sisters.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the one recognized use of gummy corn was for parching to\r\nmake corn balls; but any of the soft corns could be used to make corn\r\nballs, as soft yellow, soft white, blue, light red, and the like.\r\n\r\n_Parched Soft Corn._ Corn of any of the soft varieties parched in a\r\npot as just described, was often carried by hunters or travelers to be\r\neaten as a lunch. The corn was carried in a little bag made by drying a\r\nbuffalo’s heart skin.\r\n\r\n_Parching Whole Ripe Ears._ We parched the whole ears, sometimes, of ripe\r\nsoft white and soft yellow corn. We had many squash spits piled up in the\r\nrear of the lodge behind the beds; these made excellent roasting sticks.\r\nThe ear was stuck on the end of the stick and held over the coals.\r\n\r\nParching ripe corn on the ear was a winter custom; but boys herding\r\nhorses in the summer also parched whole ears sometimes for their midday\r\nlunch.\r\n\r\nWe did parch other kinds of corn thus, besides soft white and soft\r\nyellow, but they were not so good.\r\n\r\nThe gummy was not cooked in this way.\r\n\r\n_Parching Hard Yellow Corn with Sand._ We sometimes parched hard yellow\r\ncorn in a clay pot of our own make, with sand. Down on the sand bars by\r\nthe Missouri we found clean, pure sand; if I wanted to parch hard yellow,\r\nI put a handful of this sand in my clay pot.\r\n\r\nThe pot I now set on the coals of the fire place until the sand within\r\nwas red hot. With a piece of old tent skin to protect my hand, I drew\r\nthe pot a little way from the coals and dropped a double handful of corn\r\nwithin. I stirred the corn back and forth over the sand with a little\r\nstick.\r\n\r\nWhen I thought the corn was quite heated through, I put the pot back on\r\nthe coals again, still stirring the corn with the stick. Very soon all\r\nthe kernels cracked open with a sharp crackling noise; they burst open\r\nmuch as you say white man’s popcorn does.\r\n\r\nHard yellow corn parched in this way was softer than even the soft corns\r\nparched in a pot without sand.\r\n\r\nNo variety of corn was good cooked in this way, except hard yellow; no\r\nother kind would do.\r\n\r\n_Mạdạpo´zi Pạ´kici, or Lye-Made Hominy._ There was another way in which\r\nwe prepared hard and soft yellow and hard and soft white; this was to\r\nmake it into hominy with lye.\r\n\r\nI collected about a quart of ashes; only two kinds were used, cottonwood\r\nor elm wood ashes. When I was cooking with such wood and thought of\r\nmaking hominy, I was careful to collect the ashes, raking away the other\r\nkinds first.\r\n\r\nI put on an iron kettle nearly full of water, and brought it to a boil.\r\nInto the boiling water I put the ashes, stirring them about with a stick.\r\nThen I set the pot off to steep for a short time.\r\n\r\nWhen the ashes had settled I poured the lye off into a vessel and cleaned\r\nthe pot thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times the ashes were boiled in an earthen pot as indeed I have\r\noften seen it done when I was a girl. I was not quite twenty when we\r\nbought an iron pot for cooking. Before that we used only earthen pots for\r\ncooking in our family.\r\n\r\nHaving cleaned the pot I poured the lye back into it, put the pot on the\r\nfire, and added shelled, ripe, dried corn. This I boiled until the hulls\r\ncame off the grain and the corn kernels appeared white.\r\n\r\nI added a little water, and took the pot off the fire; I drained off the\r\nlye.\r\n\r\nI poured water into the pot and washed the corn, rubbing the kernels\r\nbetween my palms; I drained off the water.\r\n\r\nI poured in water and washed the corn a second time, in the same way; I\r\ndrained off the water.\r\n\r\nAgain I put water in the pot and boiled the corn in it. As the corn was\r\nalready soft, this boiling did not take long. I now added fats, and\r\nbeans, and sometimes dried squash, all at the same time; and the pot I\r\nreplaced on the fire. When the beans and squash were cooked, the mess was\r\nready to eat.\r\n\r\nCorn so prepared we call mạdạpo´zi pạ´kici, or boiled-whole-corn rubbed.\r\nIt is so called because the hulls of the kernels were rubbed off between\r\nthe palms at the time the corn was washed in water after the lye was\r\npoured off.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Characteristics of the Varieties_\r\n\r\nWe Hidatsas thought that our five principal varieties of corn, hard and\r\nsoft white, hard and soft yellow, and gummy, had characteristics that\r\nmarked them quite distinctly one from the other.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, they had each a distinct taste. If at night I were given\r\nto eat of hard white corn, or hard yellow or soft yellow, I could at once\r\ntell each from any of the others. If I were given mush at night made from\r\nthese three varieties, each by itself, I could distinguish each variety,\r\nnot by its smell, but in my mouth by taste.\r\n\r\nMeal made by pounding ripe hard white corn became thick and mushy when\r\nboiled in a pot.\r\n\r\nTsï´di tapa´, or soft yellow corn, was quite soft to pound when we made\r\nmeal of it; and the boiled meal, or mush, seemed to contain a good deal\r\nof water in it—that is, it seemed thin and gruel-like when we came to eat\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTo pound tsï´di tso´ki, or hard yellow corn, into meal took a long time;\r\nbut when it had been pounded and the meal boiled into food, it was very\r\ngood to eat and had an appetizing smell.\r\n\r\nOf the nine varieties I have named, the atạ´ki, or soft white, was the\r\nearliest maturing. If seeds of all nine varieties were planted at the\r\nsame time, the soft white would always be the first to ripen in the fall;\r\nand the tsï´di tso´ki, or hard yellow, would be the last to ripen.\r\n\r\nAlthough the blue, light red, dark red, pink top, and soft white were\r\nall soft or flour corns, yet the soft white was the earliest to ripen. I\r\nreckon the soft white, also, to be the softest of all our varieties of\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nI also rate the hard yellow and hard white as equal in value. Both are\r\nequally hard, and can not be pounded up into the fine flour or meal which\r\nwe get from the soft varieties.\r\n\r\nThe hard yellow and soft yellow we thought were the best varieties from\r\nwhich to prepare half-boiled dried corn for winter storing. The dark and\r\nlight reds were also used, and if not quite so good, were but little\r\ninferior. Indeed, for half-boiled dried corn, all varieties were used,\r\neven the ma´ikadicakĕ, or gummy; but this last we did not think a good\r\nvariety for this way of putting up corn. Our gummy corn had but one well\r\nrecognized use; it was good for parching to make corn balls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fodder Yield_\r\n\r\nI do not think there was any perceptible difference in the fodder yield\r\nof the various races of corn which we Hidatsas cultivated; but the fodder\r\nyield was always much heavier in rainy years. In a dry season, the stalks\r\nof the corn would be small and weak; and the leaves would be smaller than\r\nin seasons of good rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Developing New Varieties_\r\n\r\nWe Hidatsas knew that slightly differing varieties could be produced\r\nby planting seeds that varied somewhat from the main stock. A woman\r\nnamed Good Squash used to raise a variety of corn that tasted just like\r\nsoft white. This corn had large swelling kernels with deep yellow,\r\nalmost reddish, stripes running down the sides of the grain. We called\r\nit Adaka´-dahu-ita ko´xati, or Arikaras’ corn, though it was not\r\nArikara corn at all. Good Squash’s daughter, Hunts Water, lives on this\r\nreservation; she may have some of the seed of this variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPORT EARS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Names and Description_\r\n\r\nQuite often ears of corn appear that are marked by some unusual form; and\r\nfor the more marked of these forms, we had special names. Following are\r\nsome of them:\r\n\r\n_Na’´ta-tawo´xi._ From na’´ta, grain; and tawo´xi, a name applied to\r\nyouth, or the young, and conveying the idea of small. This is an ear of\r\ncorn having seventeen or eighteen rows of very small kernels. Our largest\r\nears of corn had usually but fourteen rows of kernels of normal size.\r\n\r\nIn the old legends of my tribe appear many women bearing this name\r\nNa’´ta-tawo´xi.\r\n\r\n_Wi´da-Aka´ta._ From wi´da, goose; and aka´ta, roof of the mouth. This is\r\nan ear having two rows of corn on either side, with vacant spaces on the\r\ncob between the double rows; often, toward the larger end of the ear, the\r\ntwo rows will expand into three. Goodbird has made a drawing of such an\r\near (figure 19). A wi´da-aka´ta ear, we thought, looks like the roof of\r\nthe mouth of a goose.\r\n\r\n_I´ta-Ca´ca._ Forked face, or cloven face; from i´ta, face. A kind of\r\ndouble ear. Goodbird has made a drawing of one (figure 20).\r\n\r\n_Okĕi´jpita._ From o´kĕ, or o´ki, head-ornament, plume; i´jpu, top; and\r\ni´ta, fruit. This is a small ear that sometimes appears at the top, on\r\nthe tassel of the plant.\r\n\r\nOkĕi´jpita ears, if large enough, we gathered and put in with the rest\r\nof the harvest; but smaller ears of this kind, hardly worth threshing,\r\nwe gathered and fed to our horses. Sometimes, if the harvesters were in\r\nhaste, these ears were left in the field on the stalk; a pony was then\r\nled into the field to crop the ears.\r\n\r\n_I´tica´kupadi._ I´tica´kupadi, or muffled head; so called because the\r\nkernels come down and cover the face or bearded end of the cob quite to\r\nthe point. We thought such an ear looked like a man with his head muffled\r\nup in his robe.\r\n\r\nMuffled-head ears were more numerous in good crop years than in poor\r\nyears; and we thought such ears, if otherwise well favored, made good\r\nseed corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSQUASHES\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING SQUASHES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sprouting the Seed_\r\n\r\nSquash seed was planted early in June; or the latter part of May and the\r\nfirst of June.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for planting, we first sprouted the seed.\r\n\r\nI cut out a piece of tanned buffalo robe about two and a half feet long\r\nand eighteen inches wide, and spread it on the floor of the lodge, fur\r\nside up.\r\n\r\nI took red-grass leaves, wetted them, and spread them out flat, matted\r\ntogether in a thin layer on the fur. Then I opened my bag of squash\r\nseeds, and having set a bowl of water beside me, I wet the seeds in\r\nthe water—not soaking them, just wetting—and put them on the matted\r\ngrass leaves until I had a little pile heaped up, in quantity about two\r\ndouble-handfuls.\r\n\r\nI next took broad leaved sage, the kind we use in a sweat lodge, and buck\r\nbrush leaves, and mixed them together. At squash planting time, the sage\r\nis about four inches high\r\n\r\nInto the mass of mixed sage-and-buck-brush leaves, I worked the wetted\r\nsquash seeds, until they were distributed well through it. The mass\r\nI then laid on the grass matting, which I folded over and around it.\r\nFinally I folded the buffalo skin over that, making a package about\r\nfifteen by eighteen inches. We called this package kaku´i kida´kci,\r\nsquash-thing-bound, or squash bundle.\r\n\r\nThis squash bundle I hung on the drying pole near one of the posts. The\r\nbundle did not hang directly over the fire, but a little to one side. Sed\r\nsi femina in domo menstrua erat, she should tell it so that the package\r\nof seeds could be removed to the next lodge, or they would spoil.\r\n\r\nAfter two days I took the bundle down and opened it. From a horn spoon I\r\nsipped a little tepid water into my mouth and blew it over the seeds. I\r\ntook care that the water was neither too hot nor too cold, lest it kill\r\nthe seeds. I rebound the bundle and hung it up again on the drying pole.\r\nAt the end of another day the seeds were sprouted nearly an inch and were\r\nready to plant.\r\n\r\nI took a handful of the grass-and-leaves, and from them separated the\r\nsprouted squash seeds. A wooden bowl had been placed beside me with a\r\nlittle moist earth in it. Into this bowl I put the seeds, sprinkling\r\na little earth over them to keep them moist. I was now ready to begin\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting the Sprouted Seed_\r\n\r\nUsually two or three women did the family planting, working together.\r\n\r\nOne woman went ahead and with her hoe loosened up the ground for a\r\nspace of about fifteen inches in diameter, for the hill. Care was taken\r\nthat each hill was made in the place where there had been a hill the\r\nyear before. I am sure that in olden times we raised much better crops,\r\nbecause we were careful to do so; using the same hill thus, each year,\r\nmade the soil here soft and loose, so that the plants thrived.\r\n\r\nOne woman, then, as I have said, with her hoe, loosened up the soil where\r\nan old hill had stood, and made a new hill, about fifteen inches in\r\ndiameter at the base. Following her came another woman who planted the\r\nsprouted seeds.\r\n\r\nFour seeds were planted in each hill, in two pairs. The pairs should be\r\nabout twelve inches apart, and the two seeds in each pair, a half inch\r\napart. The seeds were planted rather under, or on one side of the hill,\r\nand about two inches deep in the soil. A careful woman planted the seeds\r\nwith the sprouts upright; but even if she did not do this, the sprouts\r\ngrew quickly and soon appeared through the soil.\r\n\r\nWe had a reason for planting the squash seeds in the side of the hill.\r\nThe squash sprouts were soft, tender. If we planted them in level ground\r\nthe rains would beat down the soil, and it would pack hard and get\r\nsomewhat crusted, so that the sprouts could not break through; but if we\r\nplanted the sprouts on the side of the hill, the water from the rains\r\nwould flow over them and keep the soil soft. Likewise, we did not plant\r\nthe sprouted seeds on the top of the hill because here too the rain was\r\napt to beat the soil down hard.\r\n\r\nWe Indian women helped one another a good deal in squash planting;\r\nespecially would we do turns with our relatives. If I got behind with my\r\nplanting, some of my relatives, or friends from another family, would\r\ncome and help me. When a group of relatives thus labored together, four\r\nwomen commonly went ahead making the hills, and two women followed,\r\nplanting the sprouted seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting the Squashes_\r\n\r\nThe squash harvest began a little before green corn came in. It was\r\nour custom to pick squashes every fourth morning; and the fourth\r\npicking—twelve days after the first picking—brought us to green corn time.\r\n\r\nThe first picking was, naturally, not very large—three or four\r\nbasketfuls, I think, in my father’s family; and these we ate ourselves.\r\nThe basket used for bringing in the squashes was about fifteen inches\r\nacross the mouth and eleven inches deep.\r\n\r\nThe second picking was about ten basketfuls, enough for us to eat\r\nand spare a little surplus to our neighbors. After this each picking\r\nincreased until a maximum was reached, and then the pickings decreased in\r\nsize. The fifth or sixth picking was usually the largest.\r\n\r\nThe pickings were made before sunrise. In my father’s family, one of my\r\nmothers and I usually attended to the actual picking. It was her habit to\r\nget up early in the morning, go to the field and pluck the squashes from\r\nthe vines, piling them up in one place in the garden. She returned then\r\nto the lodge; and after the morning meal, the rest of us women of the\r\nhousehold went out and fetched the squashes home in our baskets.\r\n\r\nSquashes grow fast, and unless we picked them every four days, we did not\r\nthink them so good for food. Moreover, squashes that were four days old\r\nwe could slice for drying, knowing that the slices would be firm enough\r\nto retain their shape unbroken. If the squashes were plucked greener, the\r\nslices broke, or crumbled.\r\n\r\nWe could tell when a squash was four days old. Its diameter then was\r\nabout three and a quarter inches; some a little more, some a little less;\r\nbut we chiefly judged by the color of the fruit. A white squash should\r\njust have rid itself of green; a green colored squash should have its\r\ncolor a dark green. We could judge quite accurately thus, by the state of\r\nthe colors.\r\n\r\nThe hills yielded some three, some two, some only one squash at a\r\npicking. I have made as many as six trips to our family garden for the\r\nsquashes of a single picking; our garden was distant as far as from here\r\nto Packs Wolf’s cabin—three quarters of a mile.\r\n\r\nWe picked a good many squashes in a season. One year my mother fetched in\r\nseventy baskets from our field. I have known families to bring in as many\r\nas eighty, or even a hundred baskets, in a season.\r\n\r\nThe baskets, as they were brought in, were borne up on the drying stage,\r\nand the squashes emptied out on the floor for slicing and drying;\r\nsquashes not cooked and eaten fresh were sliced and dried for winter,\r\nexcepting those saved for seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Slicing the Squashes_\r\n\r\nSlicing squashes for drying began about the third picking. Sometimes, in\r\ngood years, a few squashes might be sliced at the second picking; but at\r\nthe third picking, slicing and drying began in earnest.\r\n\r\nWhen the squashes, emptied from the baskets, made a great heap on the\r\nfloor of the drying stage, the women of the family made a feast, cooking\r\nmuch food for the purpose; some old women were then invited to come and\r\ncut up the squashes with knives, into slices to dry. We regarded these\r\nold women as hired; and I remember that in my father’s family we hired\r\nsometimes eight, sometimes ten, sometimes only six. I think that at the\r\ntime I was a young woman, when my mothers made such a feast, about ten\r\nold women came.\r\n\r\nThese old women ascended the drying stage, and sat, five on either side\r\nof the pile of squashes. Each of the old women had a squash knife in her\r\nhand, made of the thin part of the shoulder bone of a buffalo, if it was\r\nan old-fashioned one; butcher knives of steel are now used.\r\n\r\nThe squashes were cut thus:\r\n\r\nAn old woman would draw a robe up over her lap, as she sat Indian\r\nfashion, with ankles to the right, on the floor of the stage. She took a\r\nsquash in her left hand, and with her bone knife in her right, she sliced\r\nthe squash into slices about three eighths of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nThe squash was sliced from side to side, not from stem to blossom. An old\r\nwoman slicing squash would take up a squash, cut out the stem pit and the\r\nblossom, then turn the squash sidewise and slice, beginning on the side\r\nnearest her. The cut was made by pressing the bone blade downward into\r\nthe squash as the latter lay in her palm.\r\n\r\nThe first three slices and the last three of a large squash; or the first\r\ntwo and the last two of a smaller squash, the old woman put beside her in\r\na pile, as her earnings for her work; upon this pile also went any squash\r\nthought too small to be worth slicing.\r\n\r\nThese end slices we thought less valuable than those from the middle\r\nof the squash; and unlike the latter, they were not spitted on willow\r\nsticks, but were taken home by the old woman worker in her blanket, or\r\nher robe, or in something else in which she could carry them. About three\r\nsacks of these inferior slices would be carried home at one time by an\r\nold woman worker.\r\n\r\nThese less valuable slices being cut close to the rind were of solid\r\nflesh. The better slices had each a hollow in the center, caused by the\r\nseed cavity. The old women did not spit their solid slices on willows,\r\nbut dried them on the ground, carefully guarding them against rain; for\r\nif wet, the drying slices would spoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Squash Spits_\r\n\r\nAll the better slices, the ones to be retained by the family that hired\r\nthe old women workers, were spitted on willow rods to dry.\r\n\r\nThese rods we called kaku´iptsa; from kaku´i, squash; and i´ptsa, spit,\r\nstringer. The word may be translated squash spit.\r\n\r\nSquash spits were usually made of the small willows that we call mi´da\r\nhatsihi´ci, or red willow; from mi´da, wood; and hi´ci, light red. When\r\nthe outer skin of one’s finger, for example, is peeled off, the color\r\nof the flesh beneath we call hi´ci. This red willow however is not\r\nkinikinik, which white men call red willow.\r\n\r\nA squash spit should be about half an inch in diameter; and its length\r\nshould be measured from the center of my chest to the end of my index\r\nfinger, as I do now; or about two feet, six, or two feet, seven inches.\r\n\r\nA spit was sharpened at one end to a point. At the other end there was\r\nleft about an inch of the natural bark like a button, to keep the squash\r\nslices from slipping off. The rest of the rod was peeled bare.\r\n\r\nSmall Ankle used to make our drying spits for us. He cut the rods in June\r\nor early July when the bark peeled off easily; he peeled off the bark\r\nwith his teeth.\r\n\r\nIt was his habit to cut quite a number of rods at a time and after\r\npeeling them, he would tie them up in a bundle of about three hundred\r\nrods, so that they would dry straight—would not warp, I mean, in drying.\r\n\r\nIn seasons when they were not in use our squash spits were made into a\r\nbundle as big as I could hold in my two arms and bound about with two\r\nthongs. The bundle was stored away on the floor of the lodge, under the\r\neaves, or in the atu´ti, as we called the space under the descending\r\nroof. The next year, in harvest time, the bundle was unbound and the\r\nspits examined to see if any had warped. Such warped ones were thrown\r\naway, and new ones were made to take their places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spitting the Slices_\r\n\r\nEach of the old women hired to slice our squashes worked with a pile of\r\nthese squash spits beside her; and as she sliced a squash she laid aside\r\nthose slices which she retained as her pay; and taking the others up\r\nin her right hand, she spitted them with a single thrust, upon one of\r\nthe willow spits. The spitted slices were then separated about a half\r\ninch apart, so that the first two fingers of the hand could be thrust\r\nastraddle the spit between each slice and its neighbor. This was to give\r\nthe slices air to dry.\r\n\r\nOne willow spit held the slices of four squashes, and two slices from a\r\nfifth squash, if the squashes were of average size.\r\n\r\nSometimes an old woman brought her granddaughter along to help her, the\r\nlittle girl spitting the slices as her grandmother cut them.\r\n\r\nDrying rods, which I have already described, were laid across the upper\r\nrails of the stage; and each spit as it was loaded was laid with either\r\nend resting on a drying rod. The spits were laid with a certain method.\r\nEach projecting end bore two squash slices, which acted as a button to\r\nstay the spit from being blown down by the wind.\r\n\r\nAs the drying rods rested transversely on the upper rails, the spits\r\nwhich the rods bore lay parallel with the rails, and therefore lengthwise\r\nwith the stage. The spits were laid with the heavier, or bark covered end\r\ntoward the front, or ladder end of the stage, which in our family, was\r\nthe right, as one came out of the lodge door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Owl Woman putting squash slices on a spit]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Squash slices drying\r\n\r\nAre on squash spits and on stage built to resemble the top of an old time\r\ncorn stage.]\r\n\r\nWhen a pair of drying rods was quite filled with these loaded spits,\r\nthey made what we called one i´tsạki—one walking stick, or one staff. We\r\ncounted the quantity of squash we dried as so many staves.\r\n\r\nWe never laid the loaded spits on the floor of the stage, as the weight\r\nof the load caused the drying squash slices to warp, thus making them\r\nhard to handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Case of Rain_\r\n\r\nIf a sudden rain came up the day we began drying squash, we felt no\r\nconcern, for the slices having just been cut, were still green and would\r\nnot be harmed.\r\n\r\nBut if rain threatened the second day, or thereafter, we women ran up on\r\nthe stage and drew the loaded spits toward the middle of the drying rods;\r\nand over them we spread hides, upon which we laid poles, or unused drying\r\nrods to weight the hides against the wind. Sometimes we even lashed the\r\npoles down with thongs.\r\n\r\nIf the drying squash got wet after the first day, the slices swelled up,\r\nand the fruit spoiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying and Storing_\r\n\r\nWhen the squash slices had dried for two days, two women of the family\r\nwent up on the stage; and working, one from the front, the other from the\r\nrear end of the stage, they took the spits one by one, and with thumb\r\nand fingers of each hand slipped the drying slices into the middle of\r\nthe spit, thus loosening them from it; and for the same purpose, the\r\nspit itself was turned and twisted around as it lay skewered through the\r\nslices. When well loosened, the squash slices were again spaced apart as\r\nbefore, and the spit was replaced on the rods, to be left for another\r\nday. On the evening of the third day the slices were dry enough to string.\r\n\r\nThe strings, three to six in number, had been prepared from dry grass.\r\nEach string was seven Indian fathoms long; we Hidatsas measure a fathom\r\nas the distance between a woman’s two outstretched hands. Each grass\r\nstring had a wooden needle about ten inches long, bound to one end.\r\n\r\nAll the slices on one spit were now slid off and the worker by a single\r\nthrust skewered the wooden needle through them and slid them down the\r\nlong string to the farther end; this end of the string was now looped\r\nback and tied just above the first three or four slices of the dried\r\nsquash that fell down the string; doing thus made these slices act as a\r\nbutton or anchor to prevent the rest of the squash slices from slipping\r\noff the string.\r\n\r\nIn stringing the squash slices, the spit was held in the right hand, the\r\nleft hand straddling the spit with the index and second fingers. The\r\nslices were slid down the spit toward the right hand, the spit being then\r\ndrawn out and cast away. The squash slices were held firmly in the first\r\ntwo fingers and thumb of the left hand and the needle was run through\r\nthe hole left by withdrawing the spit. As the spit had a greater diameter\r\nthan the grass string, the slices easily slid down the string.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21]\r\n\r\nWhen stringing slices of squash myself, I always sat on the floor of the\r\ndrying stage with a pile of loaded spits at my left side. As I unloaded a\r\nspit, I dropped it at my right side. The grass string hung over the edge\r\nof the stage floor, on the side nearest the lodge. On the ground below I\r\nhad spread some scraped hides, so that the squash slices, falling down\r\nthe string, would not touch the ground and become soiled.\r\n\r\nWhen a string became full, I tossed the end over the edge of the floor,\r\nletting it fall down upon the heap on the scraped hides.\r\n\r\nThe needle used to skewer the slices was bound to the end of the grass\r\nstring two inches or more from its extremity, as shown in figure 21. When\r\nthe string was filled, one had but to turn the needle athwart, and it\r\nbecame a button or anchor, preventing the slices from slipping off.\r\n\r\nThe strings filled with dried squash slices, were now taken into the\r\nlodge. Between the right front main post of the lodge and the circle of\r\nouter posts and near the puncheon fire screen at the place it bent in\r\ntoward the wall, a stage had been built. Two forked posts, about as high\r\nas my head, supported a pole ten or twelve feet long; and over this pole\r\nthe strings of squash were looped, care being taken that they hung at a\r\nheight to let the dogs run under without touching and contaminating the\r\nsquash. I speak of the right front main post; I use right and left in the\r\nIndian sense, which assumes that an earth lodge faces the doorway; the\r\ndoor indeed is the lodge’s mouth.\r\n\r\nOn sunny days these strings were taken outside. Several of the long\r\npoles, or drying rods, already described, were brought down from the top\r\nof the stage and lashed to the outside of the stage posts on either side.\r\nIf the harvest was a good one, a row of these rods might extend the whole\r\nlength of either side of the stage, and even around the ends. On the\r\nrailing thus made the squash strings were taken out and hung on a fair\r\nday; in the morning, on the east side; in the afternoon, on the west side\r\nof the stage.\r\n\r\nOn wet days, the squash strings were left inside the lodge; and if the\r\nrain was falling heavily, a tent skin, or scraped rawhides, dried and\r\nready to tan, were thrown over them to protect from dampness. The air in\r\nthe lodge was damp on a rainy day; and sometimes the roof leaked.\r\n\r\nWhen the strings of squash were thought to be thoroughly dried, they were\r\nready for storing. A portion was packed in parfleche bags, to be taken to\r\nthe winter lodge, or to be used for food on journeys. The rest was stored\r\naway in a cache pit, covered with loose corn.\r\n\r\nSeveral seasons, as I recollect, the women of my father’s family were a\r\nmonth harvesting and drying their squashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Squash Blossoms_\r\n\r\nBesides our squashes, we also gathered squash blossoms, three to five\r\nbasketfuls at a picking; and they were a recognized part of our squash\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nOn every squash vine are blossoms of two kinds; one kind bears a squash,\r\nbut the other never bears any fruit, for it grows, as we Indians say, at\r\nthe wrong place among the leaves. We Indians knew this, and gathered only\r\nthese barren blossoms; if we did not they dried up anyway and became a\r\ndead loss, so we always gathered them.\r\n\r\nThese blossoms we picked in early morning while they were fresh, but not\r\nif rain had fallen in the night, as the rain splashed dirt and sand into\r\nthe blossoms, making them unfit for food.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms we took home in baskets. On the prairie there is a kind of\r\ngrass which we Indians call “antelope hair.” We chose a place where this\r\ngrass grew thick and was two or three inches high, to dry the blossoms\r\non. They were taken out of the basket one by one; the green calyx leaves\r\nwere stripped off and the blossom was pinched flat, opened, and spread\r\non the grass, with the inside of the blossom upward, thus exposing it to\r\nthe sun and air. A second blossom was split on one side, opened, and laid\r\nupon the first, upon the petal end, so that the thicker, bulbous part of\r\nthe first—the part indeed that had been pinched flat—remained exposed to\r\ndry. This was continued until quite a space on the grass was covered with\r\nthe blossoms.\r\n\r\nThey remained all day drying. In the evening I would go out and gather\r\nthem, pulling them up in whole sheets. Splitting them open and laying\r\nthem down one upon another, caused them to adhere as they dried, so that\r\nthey lay on the grass in a kind of thin matting. I always began pulling\r\nup the blossoms from one side of this matting, and as I say, they came\r\naway in whole sheets.\r\n\r\nWe put away the dried blossoms in bags, like those used for corn. These\r\nbags were made with round bottom and soft-skin mouth that tied easily.\r\nBags were usually made of calf skin.\r\n\r\nIn my father’s family we always put away one sack full of dried squash\r\nblossoms for winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKING AND USES OF SQUASH\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Squashes_\r\n\r\nThe first squashes of the season that we plucked were about three inches\r\nin diameter; that is, they were gathered as soon as we thought they were\r\nfit for cooking; and that same day we picked blossoms also.\r\n\r\nThere might be three or four basketfuls of squashes at this first\r\npicking. These squashes we did not dry, but ate fresh; as they were the\r\nfirst vegetables of the season, we were eager to eat them. We cooked\r\nfresh squashes as follows:\r\n\r\n_Boiling Fresh Squash in a Pot._ I took a clay pot of our native\r\nmanufacture, partly filled it with fresh squashes and added water. The\r\nsmaller squashes I put in whole; larger ones I cut in two. I did not\r\nremove the seeds; left in the squash they made it taste sweeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22\r\n\r\nRedrawn from sketch by Goodbird.]\r\n\r\nI now took big leaves of the sunflower and thrust them, stem upward,\r\nbetween the squashes and the sides of the pot; the leaves then stood in a\r\ncircle around the inside of the pot, with the upper surface of each leaf\r\ninward. I added more squashes until the pot was quite full, even heaping.\r\nThe sunflower leaves I then bent inward, folding them naturally over the\r\nsquashes. I now set the pot on the fire.\r\n\r\nUnder my direction Goodbird has made a sketch of a pot of fresh squashes\r\n(figure 22); the sunflower leaves are placed and ready to be folded down.\r\n\r\nSquashes thus prepared were boiled a little longer than beef is boiled.\r\nThe sunflower leaves were put over the pot merely as a lid or covering.\r\nIt is hard to cook squashes without a cover, and this was our way of\r\nproviding one. Blossoms were not added when squashes were thus prepared.\r\n\r\nWhen the cooking was done, the green sunflower leaves, used as a cover,\r\nwere removed with a stick, and thrown away.\r\n\r\nI had a bowl of cold water near by. I dipped my hand into the water and\r\nlifted out the squash pieces one by one, and laid them on a bowl or dish.\r\nThe cold water protected my hand; for the squashes were quite hot.\r\n\r\nMost of the water in the pot had boiled out, only a little being left in\r\nthe bottom of the pot. The pieces of squash immersed in this hot water\r\nI lifted out with a horn spoon. Not much water was ever put in the pot\r\nanyhow, for it was the steam mostly that cooked the squashes. The pot\r\nwas quite heaped with squashes at the first, but the cooking reduced the\r\nbulk, making the heap go down.\r\n\r\nThe squash pieces in the bottom of the pot were apt to be a little burned\r\nor browned; and so were made sweeter, and were very good to eat.\r\n\r\nThis was the way we cooked fresh squashes in my father’s family until I\r\nwas eighteen years old; at that time we got an iron dinner pot, and began\r\nto boil our food in it instead of the old fashioned clay pot.\r\n\r\nFresh squashes, to be at their best, should be cooked on the day they are\r\npicked; left over to the next day they never taste so good.\r\n\r\n_Squashes Boiled with Blossoms._ Fresh squashes were sometimes boiled\r\nwith fresh blossoms and fats. Sunflower leaves were not then used as a\r\ncovering. Squashes so cooked were usually small; and when done, they were\r\nlifted out of the pot with a horn spoon. Cooking this mess was really by\r\nboiling, not steaming, as in the mess above described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Blossom Messes_\r\n\r\nWhen I wanted to cook fresh squash blossoms, I plucked them early in the\r\nmorning, stripping them of the little points, or spicules shown as _a_,\r\n_a´_, and _a´´_ in figure 23. These spicules I stripped backward, or\r\ndownward. I do not know why we did this; it was our custom. Then I broke\r\nthe blossom off the stem at the place in the figure marked with a dotted\r\nline. The green bulbous part of the blossom I crushed or pinched between\r\nmy thumb and finger, to make it soft and hasten cooking; for the yellow,\r\nblossom part soon cooked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23]\r\n\r\nI will now give you recipes for some messes made with these fresh,\r\ncrushed, spicule-stripped blossoms; however, dried blossoms were often\r\nused in these messes instead, and were just as good.\r\n\r\n_Boiled Blossoms._ A little water was brought to boil in a clay pot. A\r\nhandful of blossoms, either fresh or dried, was tossed into the pot and\r\nstirred with a stick. They shrunk up quite small, and another handful of\r\nblossoms was tossed in. This was continued until a small basketful of the\r\nblossoms had been stirred into the pot.\r\n\r\nInto this a handful of fat was thrown, or a little bone grease was poured\r\nin; and the mess was let boil a little longer than meat is boiled, and a\r\nlittle less than fresh squash is boiled. The mess was then ready to eat.\r\n\r\n_Blossoms Boiled with Mạdạpo´zi I’ti´a._ Mạdạpo´zi i’ti´a was made, the\r\npot being put on the fire in the early afternoon and boiled for the rest\r\nof the day. In the night following the fire would go out and the mess\r\nwould get cold.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the pot was set on the fire again, and if I was going to\r\nuse fresh blossoms I went out to the field to gather them, expecting to\r\nreturn and find the pot heated and ready. The newly gathered blossoms,\r\ncrushed as described, I dropped in the rewarmed mess, and boiled for half\r\nan hour, when the pot was taken off, and the mess was served.\r\n\r\nSometimes this mess was further varied by adding beans.\r\n\r\n_Blossoms Boiled with Mäpi´ Nakapa´._ The blossoms were first boiled.\r\nMeal of pounded parched corn and fats were then added and the whole was\r\nboiled for half an hour.\r\n\r\nLike the previous mess, this was sometimes varied by adding beans.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED SQUASHES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Selecting for Seed_\r\n\r\nSeed squashes were chosen at the first or second picking of the\r\nseason. At these pickings, as we went from hill to hill plucking the\r\nfour-days-old squashes, we observed what ones appeared the plumpest and\r\nfinest; and these we left on the vine to be saved for seed. We never\r\nchose more than one squash in a single hill; and to mark where it lay,\r\nand even more, to protect it from frost, we were careful to pull up a\r\nweed or two, or break off a few squash leaves and lay them over the\r\nsquash; and thus protected, it was left on the vine.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of variety in our squashes. Some were round,\r\nsome rather elongated, some had a flattened end; some were dark, some\r\nnearly white, some spotted; some had a purple, or yellow top. We did not\r\nrecognize these as different strains, as we did the varieties of corn;\r\nand when I selected squashes for seed, I did not choose for color, but\r\nfor size and general appearance. Squashes of different colors grew in the\r\nsame hill; and all varieties tasted exactly alike.\r\n\r\nIn later pickings, while we continued to gather the four-days-old\r\nsquashes we did not disturb the seed squashes. They were easily avoided,\r\nfor if not plainly marked by the leaves I have said we laid over them,\r\nthey could be recognized by their greater size, and their rough rind. A\r\nfour-days-old squash is smaller and has a smoother rind than a mature\r\nsquash.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gathering the Seed Squashes_\r\n\r\nThe time for plucking the seed squashes was after we had gathered the\r\nfirst ripe corn, but had not yet gathered our seed corn. It was our\r\ncustom to pluck our corn until the first frost fell; then to gather our\r\nseed squashes; and afterwards our seed corn. Some years the first frost\r\nfell very early, before we had plucked our first corn; in such seasons we\r\ngathered our seed squashes first, for we never let them lie in the field\r\nafter the first frost had set in.\r\n\r\nOn this reservation the first frost falls at the end of the moon\r\nfollowing this present moon. We Indians call the present moon the\r\nwild cherry moon, because June berries ripen in the first half, and\r\nchoke-cherries in the second half of the moon; and we reckon June berries\r\nas a kind of cherry. Our next moon we call the harvest moon; and in it\r\nwild plums ripen and the first frost falls.\r\n\r\nThe seed squashes when plucked, were all taken into the earth lodge and\r\nlaid in a pile, on a bench. The bench was made of planks split from\r\ncottonwood trunks, laid lengthwise with the lodge wall. The squashes\r\nwere piled in a heap on this bench; they were bigger than four-days-old\r\nsquashes and their rinds were rougher and hard, like a shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cooking the Ripe Squashes_\r\n\r\nWhen now we wanted to have squash for a meal, I went over to this heap of\r\nripe seed squashes and brought a number over near the fire. There I broke\r\nthem open, carefully saving the seeds. I would lay a squash on the floor\r\nof the lodge; with an elk horn scraper I would strike the squash smart\r\nblows on the side, splitting it open.\r\n\r\nThe broken half rinds I piled up one above another, concave side down,\r\nuntil ready to put them in the pot. Ripe squashes were less delicate than\r\ngreen four-days-old squashes, and did not spoil so quickly.\r\n\r\nI was able to boil about ten ripe squashes in our family pot; but it took\r\nthree such cookings of ten squashes each to make a mess for our family,\r\nwhich I have said was a large one. We boiled these ripe squashes like the\r\nfour-days-old, in a very little water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saving the Seed_\r\n\r\nAlways near the fireplace in our lodge there lay a piece of scraped hide\r\nabout two feet square. It had many uses. When boiling meat we would lift\r\nthe steaming meat from the pot and lay it on the hide before serving. We\r\nalso used the hide for a drying cloth.\r\n\r\nThis piece of hide I drew near me when I was breaking ripe squashes;\r\nand as I removed the seeds I laid them in a pile on the hide. Squash\r\nseeds, freshly removed from the squash, are moist and mixed with more or\r\nless pulpy matter. To remove this pulp I took up a small handful of the\r\nfresh seeds, laid a dry corn cob in my palm and alternately squeezed and\r\nopened my hand over the mess. The porous surface of the cob absorbed the\r\nmoisture and sucked up the pulpy matter, thus cleansing the seeds. As\r\nthe cleansed seeds fell back upon the hide I took up another handful and\r\nrepeated the process.\r\n\r\nIf there was a warm autumn sun, I often carried the hide with the\r\ncleansed seeds upon it, and laid it on the floor of the drying stage\r\noutside for the seeds to dry; but if the day was chill or winter had set\r\nin, I dried the seeds by the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen quite dried, the seeds were put in a skin sack to be stored in a\r\ncache pit. The storing bag was often the whole skin of a buffalo calf,\r\nwith only the neck left open for a mouth; or it might be made of a small\r\nfawn skin; or it might be made of a piece of old tent cover and shaped\r\nlike a cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eating the Seeds_\r\n\r\nSometimes we boiled ripe squashes whole, seeds and all; and we then ate\r\nthe seeds. They tasted something like peanuts.\r\n\r\nThese seeds of boiled squashes were eaten just as they came from the\r\nsquash. I would take up two or three seeds in my mouth, crushing them\r\nwith my teeth; and with my tongue I would separate the kernels from the\r\nshells which I spat out. I was rather fond of squash seeds.\r\n\r\nI have also heard of families who prepared squash seeds by parching or\r\nroasting; but I never did this myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Roasting Ripe Squashes_\r\n\r\nI have heard that in old days my tribe used to roast fall-kept ripe\r\nsquashes. They were buried in the ashes and roasted whole. I never did\r\nthis myself, however.\r\n\r\nThere is a story that an old man who was blind, was handed a squash thus\r\nroasted. He found the squash to his liking, but did not know how it had\r\nbeen cooked.\r\n\r\n“Girl,” he cried, “let me have the broth this was boiled in!”\r\n\r\n“The squash was roasted in the ashes; it has no broth,” answered the girl\r\nwho had handed it to him.\r\n\r\nThe blind man laughed. “I thought it was boiled in a pot,” he said.\r\n\r\nI judge from this story that several squashes had been roasted, and that\r\nthe blind man got one as his share.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Storing the Unused Seed Squashes_\r\n\r\nIt was our custom to remove to our winter village in the mida´-pạx´di\r\nwidi´c, or leaf-turn-yellow moon; it corresponds about to October. I\r\nremember the leaves used to be falling from the trees while we were\r\nworking about our winter lodges, getting ready for cold weather.\r\n\r\nWhen moving time came in the fall, any squashes left over in the lodge,\r\nuneaten, were stored in a cache pit until spring. But it was a difficult\r\nthing to store these squashes so that they would keep sound; and when\r\nspring came many of them would be found to have rotted. Some families\r\nwere more careful in making ready and storing their cache pits than were\r\nothers. Squashes kept best when stored in carefully prepared pits.\r\n\r\nOn the family’s return the next spring the cache pit was opened; and the\r\nsquashes that had kept sound could be used for cooking, and their seeds\r\ncould be planted. The number thus stored over winter was not large.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of rotted squashes were just as good to plant as were the seeds\r\nof the sound squashes.\r\n\r\nWe carried no squash seeds with us to our winter village. For our spring\r\nplanting we depended on the seed we had left stored in the cache in our\r\nsummer lodge, in my father’s family.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of a ripe squash are swelled and plump in the center; those\r\nof a four-days-old squash are flat. We could tell in this way if squash\r\nseeds were ripe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Squashes, Present Seed_\r\n\r\nI grew our native squashes in my son Goodbird’s garden until four years\r\nago. I stopped cultivating them because my son’s family did not seem\r\nto care to eat them. Last year a squash vine came up wild in my son’s\r\ngarden. The squashes that grew on it were of two colors. I saved some of\r\nthe seed and planted them this year. It is from their yield that I have\r\ngiven you seed.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, squashes were of different colors and varied a good deal\r\nin shape; yet we recognized but one strain of seed. “We plant but one\r\nkind of seed,” we said, “and all colors and shapes grow from it, dark,\r\nwhite, purple, round, elongated.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Squash Dolls_\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing I will tell before we forsake the subject of\r\nsquashes. Little girls of ten or eleven years of age used to make dolls\r\nof squashes.\r\n\r\nWhen the squashes were brought in from the field, the little girls\r\nwould go to the pile and pick out squashes that were proper for dolls.\r\nI have done so, myself. We used to pick out the long ones that were\r\nparti-colored; squashes whose tops were white or yellow and the bottoms\r\nof some other color. We put no decorations on these squashes that we had\r\nfor dolls. Each little girl carried her squash about in her arms and sang\r\nfor it as for a babe. Often she carried it on her back, in her calf skin\r\nrobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBEANS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting Beans_\r\n\r\nBean planting followed immediately after squash planting.\r\n\r\nBeans were planted in hills the size and shape of squash hills, or about\r\nseven by fourteen inches; but if made in open ground the hills were not\r\nplaced so far apart in the row. Squash hills, like corn hills, stood\r\nabout four feet apart in the row, measuring from center to center; but\r\nbean hills might be placed two feet or less in the row.\r\n\r\nBeans, however, were very commonly planted not in open ground, but\r\nbetween our rows of corn; the hills were arranged as shown in diagram\r\n(figure 8, page 25).\r\n\r\nCorn hills, I have said, stood four feet, or a little less in the row,\r\nand the rows were about four feet apart,[17] when corn was planted by\r\nitself. But if beans were to be planted between, the corn rows were\r\nplaced a little farther apart, to make room for the bean hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Putting in the Seeds_\r\n\r\nTo make a hill for beans, I broke up and loosened the soil with my\r\nhoe, scraping away the dry top soil; the hill I then made of the soft,\r\nslightly moist under-soil. The hill, as suggested by the measurements,\r\nwas rather elongated.\r\n\r\nI took beans, three in each hand, held in thumb and first two fingers,\r\nand buried them in a side of the hill, two inches deep, by a simultaneous\r\nthrust of each hand, as I stooped over; the two groups of seeds were six\r\ninches apart.\r\n\r\nI have heard that some families planted four seeds in each group, instead\r\nof three; but I always put in three seeds and think that the better way.\r\nFigure 24 will explain the two ways of planting.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that I know just why we planted beans always in the side of\r\nthe hill; I have said we planted squash thus because the sprouted seeds\r\nwere tender and the soil in the side of the hill did not bake hard after\r\na rain. Also, we were careful not to make our bean hills too large, as\r\nthe heavy rains turned the soft soil into mud which beat down over the\r\nvines, killing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hoeing and Cultivating_\r\n\r\nThese subjects I have sufficiently described, I think, when I told you\r\nhow we hoed and cultivated corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Threshing_\r\n\r\nThreshing was in the fall, after the beans had ripened and the pods were\r\ndead and dried. Sometimes, when the weather had been favorable, the\r\nbean vines were quite dry and could be threshed the same day they were\r\ngathered. But if the weather was a little damp, or if, as was usually the\r\ncase, the vines were still a little green, they had to be dried a day or\r\ntwo before they could be threshed.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for this labor, I went out into the field and pulled up all\r\nthe corn stalks in a space four or five yards in diameter; this was for a\r\ndrying place.\r\n\r\nI pulled up the vines of one bean hill and transferred them to my left\r\nhand, where I held them by the roots; I gathered another bunch of bean\r\nvines in my right hand, as many as I could conveniently carry; and I took\r\nthese vines, borne in my two hands, to the drying place, and laid them on\r\nthe ground, roots up, spreading them out a little. I thus worked until I\r\nhad pulled up all the vines that grew near the drying place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24\r\n\r\nRedrawn from sketch by Goodbird.]\r\n\r\nI made several such drying places, as the need required; and on them I\r\nput all the bean vines to dry.\r\n\r\nAt the end of about three days, when the vines were dry I took out into\r\nthe field half of an old tent cover and laid it on the ground in an open\r\nspace made by clearing away the corn stalks. This tent cover, so laid,\r\nwas to be my threshing floor.\r\n\r\nWe never laid this tent cover at the edge of the field on the grass,\r\nbecause in threshing the vines, some of the beans would fly up and fall\r\noutside the tent cover, on the ground. We always picked these stray beans\r\nup carefully, after threshing. This could not be done if we threshed on\r\nthe grass.\r\n\r\nMy threshing floor ready, I took up some of the dry vines and laid them\r\non the tent cover in a heap, about three feet high. I got upon this heap\r\nwith my moccasined feet and smartly trampled it, now and then standing on\r\none foot, while I shuffled and scraped the other over the dry vines; this\r\nwas done to shake the beans loose from their pods.\r\n\r\nWhen the vines were pretty well trampled I pushed them over two or three\r\nfeet to one side of the tent cover; and having fetched fresh vines, I\r\nmade another heap about three feet high, which also I trampled and pushed\r\naside. When I had trampled three or four heaps in this manner I was ready\r\nto beat them.\r\n\r\nWe preferred to tread out our beans thus, because beating them with a\r\nstick made the seeds fly out in all directions upon the ground; when the\r\nvines were trampled, this would not happen. However, after the treading\r\nwas over, there were always a few unopened pods still clinging to the\r\nvines; and to free the beans from these pods, we beat the vines at the\r\nend of every three or four treadings.\r\n\r\nThis beating I did with a stick, about the size of the stick used as a\r\nflail in threshing corn.\r\n\r\nI always threshed my beans on a windy day if possible, so that I might\r\nwinnow them immediately after the threshing. If the wind died down, I\r\ncovered over the threshed beans and waited until the wind came up again.\r\nA small carrying basket or a wooden bowl, was used to winnow with.\r\n\r\nAfter the beans were winnowed, they were dried one more day, either on a\r\ntent cover in the garden, or at home on a skin placed on the ground near\r\nthe drying stage. At the end of this day’s drying, they were ready to be\r\npacked in sacks.\r\n\r\nOur bean harvests varied a good deal from year to year; in my father’s\r\nfamily, from as little as half a sack, to as much as three barrels. The\r\nbiggest harvest our family ever put up, that I remember, was equivalent\r\nto about three barrelfuls. Of course we did not use barrels in those days.\r\n\r\nBean threshing never lasted long; it was work that could be done rapidly.\r\n\r\nGathering up the vines, threshing, and winnowing took about a day and a\r\nhalf; the actual threshing lasted only about half a day. But this does\r\nnot take into account the time the vines and the threshed beans lay\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nI remember that one year, when our crop was of good size, for the whole\r\nwork of threshing and labor of getting our bean crop in, I spent but\r\nthree days. In this time I had gathered up the vines, threshed them, and\r\nwinnowed the threshed beans.\r\n\r\nHowever, the time necessary for these labors varied much with the crop,\r\nthe weather, and the greenness of the vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties_\r\n\r\nThere were five varieties of beans in common use in my tribe, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Ama´ca ci´pica                     Black bean\r\n    Ama´ca hi´ci                       Red bean\r\n    Ama´ca pu´xi                       Spotted bean\r\n    Ama´ca ita´ wina´ki matu´hica      Shield-figured bean\r\n    Ama´ca atạ´ki                      White bean\r\n\r\nThese varieties we planted, each by itself; and each kind, again, was\r\nkept separate in threshing; also, only beans of the same variety were put\r\nin one bag for storing. Black, red, white, shield-figured, spotted, each\r\nhad a separate bag.\r\n\r\nBesides the foregoing varieties, there were some families who raised a\r\nvariety of yellow beans. I once planted some seed of this variety, but\r\ndid not find that they bred very true to color; I do not know if this was\r\nbecause I did not get very good seed.\r\n\r\nI do not think these yellow beans were in use in my tribe in very old\r\ntimes. Whether they were imported to us by white men, or, as seems\r\nlikely, were brought from other tribes, I do not know.\r\n\r\nThe white beans now raised in this part of the reservation, seed of which\r\nyou have purchased, is from white man’s stock. The seed was brought to\r\nus, I think, when I was a little girl, or about sixty years ago. But we\r\nHidatsas and Mandans had white beans before this. The two strains are\r\neasily distinguished. In the white man’s variety, the eye is a little\r\nsunken in the seed. In the native white beans, the eye is on a level with\r\nthe body of the bean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Selecting Seed Beans_\r\n\r\nIn the spring, when I came to plant beans, I was very careful to select\r\nseed for the following points: seed should be fully ripe; seed should be\r\nof full color; seed should be plump, and of good size.\r\n\r\nIf the red was not a deep red, or the black a deep black, I knew the seed\r\nwas not fully ripe, and I would reject it. So also of the white, the\r\nspotted, and the shield-figured.\r\n\r\nDid I learn from white men thus to select seed? (Laughing heartily.) No,\r\nthis custom comes down to us from very old times. We were always taught\r\nto select seed thus, in my tribe.\r\n\r\nWhite men do not seem to know very much about raising beans. Our school\r\nteacher last year raised beans in a field near the school-house; and when\r\nharvest time came, he tried to pluck the pods directly into a basket,\r\nwithout treading or threshing the vines. I think it would take him a very\r\nlong time to harvest his beans in that manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cooking and Uses_\r\n\r\nOf the several varieties, I like to eat black beans best. Especially I\r\nlike to use black beans in making mä´dakapa. However, all the other kinds\r\nwere good.[18]\r\n\r\nI have already described to you some of the dishes we made, and still\r\nmake, with beans. Following are some messes I have not described:\r\n\r\n_Ama´ca Di´hĕ_, or _Beans-Boiled_. The beans were boiled in a clay pot,\r\nwith a piece of buffalo fat, or some bone grease. If the beans were dried\r\nbeans, they were boiled a little longer than squash is boiled—a half hour\r\nor more. Spring salt, or other seasoning, was not used.\r\n\r\nGreen beans, shelled from the pod, were sometimes prepared thus, boiled\r\nwith buffalo fat or bone grease; but green beans did not have to be\r\nboiled quite as long as dried beans.\r\n\r\n_Green Beans Boiled in the Pod._ Green beans in the pod we boiled and\r\nate as a vegetable from the time they came in until fall; but we did not\r\nplant beans, as we did corn, to make them come in late in the season,\r\nthat we might then eat them green.\r\n\r\nGreen beans in the pod were boiled in a clay pot, with a little fat\r\nthrown in. Pods and seeds were eaten together.\r\n\r\nBut a green bean pod has in it two little strings that are not very good\r\nto eat. At meal time the boiled pod was taken up in the fingers and\r\ncarried to the eater’s mouth. At one end of the pod is always a kind of\r\nlittle hook; the unbroken pod was taken into the mouth with this little\r\nhook forward, between the teeth; and the eater, seizing the little hook\r\nbetween thumb and finger, drew it out of his mouth with the two little\r\nstrings that were always attached to the hook.\r\n\r\n_Green Corn and Beans._ Pounded green shelled corn was often boiled with\r\ngreen beans, shelled from the pod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSTORING FOR WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cache Pit_\r\n\r\nWe stored our corn, beans, sunflower seed and dried squash in cache pits\r\nfor the winter, much as white people keep vegetables in their cellars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 25\r\n\r\nRedrawn from sketch by Goodbird.]\r\n\r\nA cache pit was shaped somewhat like a jug, with a narrow neck at the\r\ntop. The width of the mouth, or entrance, was commonly about two feet; on\r\nthe very largest cache pits the mouth was never, I think, more than two\r\nfeet eight, or two feet nine inches. In diagram (figure 25), the width of\r\npit’s mouth at _BB´_ should be a little more than two feet, narrowing to\r\ntwo feet a little higher up.\r\n\r\nIn my father’s family, we built our cache pits so that they were each of\r\nthe size of a bull boat at the bottom. Other measurements were, as I\r\nhere show with my hands, one foot eight inches from the top of the mouth,\r\nwhere it is level with the ground, down to the puncheon cover that lay in\r\nthe trench dug for the purpose; and two feet and a half from this plank\r\ncover to the lower part of the neck, marked _BB´_ in the diagram.\r\n\r\nDescent into one of these big cache pits was made with a ladder; but in a\r\nsmall one, such as I have made you in vertical-section model, in a bank\r\nby the Missouri, and which you have photographed, the depth was not so\r\ngreat. In one of these smaller pits, when standing on the floor within,\r\nmy eyes just cleared the level of the ground above, so that I could look\r\naround. When such a pit was half full of corn, I could descend and come\r\nout again, without the help of a ladder. At other times I had to be\r\nhelped out; I would hold up my hands, and my mother, or some one else,\r\nwould come and give me a lift.\r\n\r\nUsually, two women worked together thus in a cache pit, one helping the\r\nother out, or taking things from her hands. One of my mothers was usually\r\nmy helper.\r\n\r\nThe digging and storing of a cache pit was women’s work. For digging the\r\npit, a short handled hoe was used; of iron, in my day; of bone, I have\r\nheard, in olden times.\r\n\r\nI have dug more than one cache pit myself. I began by digging the round\r\nmouth, dragging the loosened earth away with my hoe. As the pit grew in\r\ndepth, the excavated earth was carried off in a wooden bowl. I stood in\r\nthe pit with the bowl at my feet and labored with my hoe, raking the\r\nearth into the bowl. When it was full, I handed the bowl to my mother,\r\nwho bore it away and emptied it.\r\n\r\nIt took me two days and a good part of a third to dig a cache pit, my\r\nmother helping me to carry off the dirt; such a cache pit, I mean, as we\r\nused in my father’s family, and which, as I have said, was large enough\r\nfor a bull boat cover to be fitted into the bottom.\r\n\r\nA trench for the puncheon cover of the mouth was the very last part of\r\nthe cache pit to be dug; but I will describe the use of this trench a\r\nlittle farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grass for Lining_\r\n\r\nWhen the cache pit was all dug, it had next to be lined with grass. The\r\ngrass used for this purpose, and for closing the mouth of the cache pit,\r\nwas the long bluish kind that grows near springs and water courses on\r\nthis reservation; it grows about three feet high. In the fall, this kind\r\nof grass becomes dry at the top, but is still green down near the roots;\r\nand we then cut it with hoes and packed it in bundles, to the village.\r\n\r\nThis bluish grass was the only kind used for lining a cache pit. We knew\r\nby repeated trials that other kinds of grass would mold, and did not keep\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grass Bundles_\r\n\r\nI remember, one time, I went out with my mother to cut grass. I took a\r\npony along to pack our loads home. I loaded the pony with four bundles\r\nof grass, two on each side, bound to the saddle. A bundle was about four\r\nfeet long, and from two and a half to three feet thick, pressed tight\r\ntogether. One bundle made a load for a woman.\r\n\r\nBesides the four bundles loaded on my pony, my mother packed one bundle\r\nback to the village, and three or four dogs dragged each a bundle on a\r\ntravois.\r\n\r\nWe reckoned that three of these bundles would be needed to line and\r\nclose a large cache pit; and two and a half bundles, for a smaller pit.\r\nA hundred such bundles were needed to cover the roof of an earth lodge.\r\nLong established use made us able to make the bundles about alike in\r\nweight, though of course we had no scales to weigh them in those days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grass Binding Rope_\r\n\r\nEach bundle was bound with a rope of grass. In a bed of this grass as it\r\nstands by the spring or stream, there is often found dead grass from the\r\nyear before, or even from two years previous, standing among the other\r\ngrass stems that are still somewhat green at the roots. To make a binding\r\nrope I must use only dead grass. I did so in this manner:\r\n\r\nI stooped, took a wisp of grass in my hands, twisting it to the left and\r\nat the same gently lifting it, when all the dry stems would break off at\r\nthe roots. I took a half step forward, laid the twisted end of the strand\r\non the ground, and grasped another wisp of grass, which I twisted to the\r\nleft and broke off as before; but I twisted the new wisp in such manner\r\nthat it made part of the continued twisted strand. I continued thus until\r\nI had a strand long enough to tie my bundle. Figure 26 is a sketch made\r\nafter my description of a grass bundle, showing the grass rope and the\r\ntie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26\r\n\r\nExact reproduction of sketch by Goodbird. The tie is pronounced accurate\r\nby Buffalobird-woman.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying the Grass Bundles_\r\n\r\nThese grass bundles we fetched home and laid on the drying stage until we\r\nwere ready to use them. Just before using, we took the bundles up on the\r\nroof of the earth lodge, broke the binding ropes and spread the grass out\r\nto dry, for one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Willow Floor_\r\n\r\nThe walls of the cache pit were left bare for the grass lining; but a\r\nfloor was laid on the bottom. This was rather simply made by gathering\r\ndead and dry willow sticks, and laying them evenly and snugly over the\r\nbottom of the pit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grass Lining_\r\n\r\nOver this willow floor, the grass, now thoroughly dried, was spread\r\nevenly, to a depth of about four inches. Grass was then spread over the\r\nwalls to a depth of three or four inches, and stayed in place with about\r\neight willow sticks. These were placed vertically against the walls\r\nand nailed in place with wooden pins made each from the fork of a dead\r\nwillow, as shown in figure 27. The ends of the sticks should reach to the\r\nneck of the cache pit, at the place marked _B_, in diagram (figure 25,\r\npage 87).\r\n\r\nWe were careful to spread the grass lining evenly over the walls; and we\r\nwere especially careful not to let the root ends get matted together, as\r\nthey were very apt to do.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the willow flooring of the pit, the willow\r\nstaying rods, and the wooden pins that held them in place, were all made\r\nof dead and dry willows; this was done that everything within the pit\r\nmight be perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to place the grass lining of the cache pit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skin Bottom Covering_\r\n\r\nIf the cache pit was a small one, we covered the bottom with a circular\r\npiece of skin, cut to fit the pit bottom, and laid it directly on the\r\ngrass matting that covered the willow floor; but if the cache pit was a\r\nlarge one, we fitted into the bottom the skin cover of a bull boat, with\r\nthe willow frame removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Storing the Cache Pit_\r\n\r\nThe cache pit was now ready to be stored.\r\n\r\nMy mother and I—and by “my mother” I mean always one of my two mothers,\r\nfor my mother that bore me was dead—fetched an old tent cover from the\r\nearth lodge, and laid it by the cache pit so that one end of the cover\r\nhung down the pit’s mouth. Upon this tent cover we emptied a big pile of\r\nshelled ripe corn, fetched in baskets from the bull boats in which it had\r\nbeen temporarily stored inside the lodge. We also fetched many strings of\r\nbraided corn, and laid them on one side of the tent cover. Lastly, we\r\nfetched some strings of dried squash and laid them on the tent cover.\r\n\r\nOf dried squash, I fetched but one string at a time, doubled and folded\r\nover my left arm. A string of dried squash, as I have said, was always\r\nseven Indian fathoms long; and I have described an Indian fathom as\r\nthe distance from the tips of the fingers of one hand to the tips of\r\nthe fingers of the other, with both hands outstretched at either side.\r\nAs these measurements were made by the women workers, an Indian fathom\r\naveraged about five and a half feet in length. A string of dried squash,\r\nseven Indian fathoms in length, we knew by experience to be just about\r\nthe weight that a woman could conveniently carry. A string eight fathoms\r\nlong would be too heavy; and one six fathoms long would be rather short.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28\r\n\r\nPlan of cache in horizontal section: A, floor ready for storing; B, the\r\nfirst series of braided strings; C, loose corn; D, first squash string.\r\n\r\nIn vertical section: E, the first series of braided strings of corn; F,\r\nadding loose corn; G, the first squash string; H, loose corn filled in\r\naround squash.]\r\n\r\nAll being now ready, my mother descended into the cache pit. Leaning over\r\nthe mouth, I handed her a string of braided corn. In my father’s family,\r\nwe usually braided fifty-four, or fifty-five ears, to a string; and a\r\nwoman could carry about three strings on her left shoulder. These braided\r\nstrings, as I have said, my mother and I fetched from the drying stage;\r\nshe stood on the stage floor and handed me the braided strings, and I\r\nbore them off to the cache pit.\r\n\r\nLeaning over the pit then, as I have said, I handed my mother one of the\r\nbraided strings that now lay in a heap on the tent cover. My mother\r\ntook the string of corn, folded it once over, and laid it snugly against\r\nthe wall of the cache pit, on the skin bottom covering, with the tips of\r\nthe ears all pointed inward. Folding a string thus kept the ears from\r\nslipping, and stayed them more firmly in place; and the ears, laid husk\r\nend to the wall, were better preserved from danger of moisture.\r\n\r\nMy mother continued thus all around the bottom of the pit, until she had\r\nsurrounded it with a row of braided corn laid against the wall, two ears\r\ndeep; for the strings, being doubled, lay therefore two ears deep.\r\n\r\nMy mother now started a second row, or series, of strings of braided corn\r\ndoubled over, laying them upon the first series; and like these, with the\r\nears all pointed inward. When this series was completed, the bottom of\r\nthe cache pit was surrounded by strings of braided corn, which, because\r\ndoubled, now lay four ears deep.\r\n\r\nMy mother now called to me that she was ready for the shelled, or loose,\r\ncorn. Obeying her, I pushed the shelled corn that lay on the tent cover,\r\ndown the overhanging end of the skin into the cache pit, until the floor\r\nof the pit was filled up level with the top of the four-tiered series of\r\nstrings of braided corn. It will be seen now how necessary it was that a\r\nhide or bull boat cover be put in the bottom of the cache pit, to receive\r\nthis shelled grain.\r\n\r\nI next passed down a string of dried squash, seven fathoms long; and this\r\nmy mother coiled and piled up in the center of the cache pit upon the\r\nshelled corn. This loose corn, I have already said, lay level with the\r\ntopmost row of ears laid against the pit’s wall, but did not quite cover\r\nthe ears. I remember, as I looked down into the pit, I could see these\r\ncorn ears lying in a circle about the loose corn within. Figure 28, drawn\r\nunder my direction, shows in a series of rough sketches how the cache pit\r\nwas filled.\r\n\r\nAgain I passed down strings of braided corn to my mother. These she\r\ndoubled, as before, and laid them around the wall of the cache pit, until\r\nthey came up level with the top of the squash heap coiled in the center.\r\nWe did not have any fixed number of rows of corn to place now; my mother\r\njust piled the doubled braids around the wall until they came even with\r\nthe top of the coiled squash string.\r\n\r\nMy mother then called to me, and again I shoved loose corn into the cache\r\npit, until it just barely covered the coiled squash pile and the topmost\r\nrow of braided ears.\r\n\r\nThe object of our putting the squash in the center of the shelled corn\r\nwas to protect it from dampness. The shelled ripe corn did not spoil very\r\neasily, but dried squash did. We were careful, therefore, to store the\r\nstrings of squash in the very center of the cache pit and surround them\r\non every side with the loose corn; this protected the squash and kept it\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nWe continued working, my mother and I, until the cache pit was filled.\r\nIn an average sized cache pit we would usually store four seven-fathom\r\nstrings of dried squash, coiled each in a heap in the center of the\r\ncache and hidden as described, in the loose corn; and as I recollect\r\nit, I think it took about thirty or more strings of braided corn to lie\r\naround the wall of an average sized pit; but my memory here is a little\r\nuncertain, and this estimate may not be quite accurate.\r\n\r\nWe filled the pit about up to the point marked _B_ in the diagram (figure\r\n25), the last two feet being filled with shelled corn only; thus the last\r\nstring of squash put in the cache pit should be covered with at least two\r\nfeet of loose corn.\r\n\r\nOver this shelled corn, at _B_ in the diagram, we snugly fitted a\r\ncircular cover, cut from the thick skin of the flank of a buffalo bull.\r\nA bull’s hide is thicker than a buffalo cow’s, and for this reason was\r\nseldom made into a robe; but there were purposes for which a bull’s hide\r\nwas preferred. Thus the heavy thick-haired parts of a bull’s hide were\r\nmuch used for making saddle skins, because the heavy wool protected the\r\nhorse’s back; and the short haired parts were much used for making cache\r\npit covers. Using these parts of the hide for covers, we did not have\r\nto bother to scrape off the hair, which in summer is very short on a\r\nbuffalo’s flanks. The skin cover was laid hair side up, so that the flesh\r\nside would come next to the loose corn.\r\n\r\nOn this hide cover my mother and I laid grass,[19] of the same kind as\r\nused for lining the cache pit wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 29\r\n\r\nRedrawn from sketch by Goodbird.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Puncheon Cover_\r\n\r\nUpon this grass, if the pit was one of the smaller ones, we laid\r\npuncheons; and these puncheons, as I have said, rested in a trench.\r\n\r\nThe puncheons, split from small logs, were laid in the trench flat side\r\ndown, so that they would not rock. There were about five main planks, or\r\npuncheons, the middle one being the heaviest, the better to sustain the\r\nweight of any horse that might happen to walk over the cache pit’s mouth.\r\nOn either side of these main puncheons were two shorter ones, laid to\r\ncover the small area of the pit’s mouth not covered by the main puncheons.\r\n\r\nFigure 29 by Goodbird, drawn from the small model I made for you in Wolf\r\nChief’s yard, will explain this. The puncheons shown in the figure\r\nexactly fit the trench; and their circumscribed outline represents also\r\nthe shape of the trench. The dotted circle represents the pit’s mouth,\r\nnow hidden by the over-lying puncheons.\r\n\r\nUpon the puncheons we now laid grass, quite filling the pit’s mouth, and\r\neven heaped, it might be, a foot high above the level of the ground; this\r\nwe trampled down hard, well into the mouth of the pit.\r\n\r\nOver this grass we fitted a second cover, cut as was the first from a\r\nbuffalo bull’s hide; and upon this we heaped earth until the pit was\r\nfilled level with the ground.\r\n\r\nLastly, we raked ashes and refuse dirt over the spot, to hide it from any\r\nenemy that might come prowling around in the winter, when the village was\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nI have said that puncheons, resting in a trench, were used to cover the\r\nmouth of a cache pit of smaller size. If the pit was of the larger size,\r\nI dug about two feet down in the neck or opening, a rectangular place\r\non either side, with my knife. Puncheons were thrust down into one of\r\nthese rectangular openings and drawn through into the other, covering\r\nthe mouth of the pit; and as in the smaller pit, there were several main\r\npuncheons, with one or two smaller and shorter ones at either side. Grass\r\nwas stuffed into the two openings, above the ends of the puncheons, to\r\nfirm the latter. Above the puncheons, the mouth of the pit was filled in,\r\nas was that of the smaller pit, with grass, a circular skin cover, and\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe two rectangular openings which I dug with my knife in the neck of the\r\nlarger pit, were, as will be noted, a little farther down than was the\r\nfloor of the trench of the smaller pit. This was because the neck was\r\nlonger in a pit of the larger size.\r\n\r\n\r\nCACHE PITS IN SMALL ANKLE’S LODGE\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Account_\r\n\r\nIn diagram (figure 30), I have marked the positions of the cache pits we\r\nhad in use in my father’s family, when I was a girl. Cache _A_ was used\r\nfor hard yellow shelled corn; but the braids piled against the wall of\r\nthe pit were of white corn; so also of _B_ and _C_. In cache _D_ were\r\nstored dried boiled corn and strings of dried squash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30]\r\n\r\nSometimes in one of the cache pits outside of the lodge we put a bag of\r\nbeans, or sometimes two bags. Each bag was of skin and was about as long\r\nas one’s arm; its shape was long and round.\r\n\r\nIn the fall, when we went to our winter lodges, corn, squash, beans, and\r\nwhatever else was needed, we loaded on our horses and took with us. As\r\nsoon as we came to our winter lodge we made ready a cache pit at once and\r\nstored these things away.\r\n\r\nWe opened a cache pit whenever we got out of provisions. When should\r\nthis be, you ask? When we got out of provisions. This might happen\r\nat any time. One winter, I remember, we got out of provisions and a\r\nnumber of our people left the winter village and went to the lodges at\r\nLike-a-fishhook village, to open a cache. The Sioux surrounded them\r\nthere. Our people took refuge in a kind of fort that belonged to the\r\ntraders and fired down from an upper room; they killed two of the Sioux.\r\n\r\nCache pit _F_ in the diagram, we made afterwards. Pit _E_ was also of\r\nlater make; we dug it after we got potatoes; it was inside the lodge and\r\nnear the corral for horses.\r\n\r\nCache pit _C_ we had to abandon because mice got into it and we could not\r\nget rid of them. So we filled it up with earth and dug pit _D_. We stored\r\ngummy corn in cache pit _D_ and used it for two years. The third year the\r\nSioux came against our village in the winter time and stole our corn and\r\nburned down my father’s lodge.\r\n\r\nI have been telling you how the cache pit was used for storing things\r\nfor winter; but I do not mean that it was of no use in summer time. In\r\nearly spring we put into a cache pit two big packages of dried meat and a\r\nbladder full of bone grease. We did not take them out until about August\r\nor a little earlier. The meat would still be good, and the bone grease\r\nwould be hard and sweet, just as if it were frozen.\r\n\r\nA cache pit lasted for a long time, used year after year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Second Account on Another Day_\r\n\r\nWe had four cache pits to store grain for my father’s family; one held\r\nsquash, vegetables, corn, etc.\r\n\r\nA second held shelled yellow corn. In this cache the usual strings of\r\ncorn laid around to protect the shelled grain from the wall, were of\r\nwhite corn. We did not braid hard yellow corn. It was corn that we did\r\nnot often use for parching.\r\n\r\nA third cache held white shelled corn, protected by the usual braided\r\nstrings of white corn.\r\n\r\nA fourth cache pit was a small one inside the lodge; here we stored dried\r\nwild turnips, dried choke-cherries, and dried June berries; and any\r\nvaluables that we could not take with us to our winter village.\r\n\r\nOur cache pits were for the most part located outside the lodge, because\r\nmice were found inside the lodge, and they were apt to be troublesome.\r\n\r\nIn the cache pit where we stored our yellow corn, we stored the grain\r\nloose, not in sacks.\r\n\r\nI knew of course where each cache pit was located.\r\n\r\nThe Sioux sometimes came up against us in winter and raided our cached\r\ncorn. One winter (about 1877) they came up and burned our lodges and\r\nstole all that was in our cache pits.\r\n\r\nWe returned from our winter quarters to our permanent village a little\r\nbefore ice breaks on the Missouri, or in the latter part of March.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diagram of Small Ankle’s Lodge_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31\r\n\r\nRedrawn from sketch by Goodbird.\r\n\r\nA.

My three\r\nbrothers slept in bed _E_, but often Wolf Chief or Bear’s Tail and their\r\nwives would be away, staying at some other lodge, perhaps at the wife’s\r\nmother’s; sometimes they visited thus for a long time. The boys might\r\nthen make use of the vacant bed of the visiting couple.\r\n\r\nAll beds were covered with skins, as I have before described to you.\r\n\r\nSmall children slept with their parents.\r\n\r\nI do not know why my father put his medicine shrines in the rear of the\r\nlodge. Ours was a big family and there was not room enough for all the\r\nbeds on one side. Probably Small Ankle wanted the medicine objects near\r\nhis bed and not where the children were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MAKING OF A DRYING STAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stages in Like-a-fishhook Village_\r\n\r\nThere were about seventy lodges in Like-a-fishhook village, when I was a\r\ngirl. A corn drying stage stood before every lodge.\r\n\r\nThat before Small Ankle’s lodge was a three-section stage, of eight\r\nposts. White Feather, or his wives, owned two of these big eight-post\r\nstages, one before each of their two lodges; for White Feather had four\r\nwives. Many Growths—a woman—had a big eight-post stage. There were a few\r\nother eight-post stages in the village, but they were small, with narrow\r\nsections and posts placed relatively rather close to one another.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the stages in the village, as I recollect, were all six-post,\r\nor two-section, stages.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, whether of a six-post or eight-post stage, the floor was\r\nupheld by two long, but narrow beams, that ran the whole length of the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThe description I shall now give of the making of a drying stage, is of\r\nan eight-post stage, such as always stood before my father’s lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cutting the Timbers_\r\n\r\nThe timbers we used for building a drying stage were all of cottonwood.\r\nBeing thus of a soft wood, the timbers did not last so very long when\r\nexposed to the weather; and a stage built of cottonwood timbers lasted\r\nonly about three years; the fourth year, unless the stage was rebuilt,\r\nthe posts rotted and the stage would fall down. Unlike the posts of a\r\nwatchers’ stage, those of a drying stage were always carefully peeled of\r\nbark, as they rotted more quickly if the bark was left on.\r\n\r\nMy mother’s drying stage, as I have said, had eight posts; and these\r\nposts we cut with forks at the top. If we could find them, or if we had\r\ntime to hunt for them in the woods, we cut double-forked posts, like\r\nthat of figure 32. But it was much easier to get the smaller posts, of\r\nthe height of the stage floor. Such a post had but one fork at the top,\r\nin which lay one of the beams that supported the floor; and a companion\r\npost, longer and not so heavy, stood by it to support the railing at the\r\ntop of the stage. However, in reckoning the number of posts of a stage, I\r\ncount a single-forked post and its companion as but one post.\r\n\r\nFor the two long beams on which the floor of the stage was to be laid, we\r\ncut two rather slender logs, the longest we could find in the woods.\r\n\r\nAll these timbers we cut in the summer time, peeling off the bark and\r\nletting them lie until winter, to dry. Then when there was snow on the\r\nground, we hitched ropes to the seasoned timbers and dragged them into\r\nthe village.\r\n\r\nThe stage was built the following spring or summer, to be ready for the\r\nfall harvest; so that we commonly cut the timbers for a stage nine months\r\nor a year before they were to be used in building it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Digging the Post Holes_\r\n\r\nWhen we were ready to begin building, the first thing we had to do was\r\nto mark the post holes. We laid the two long floor beams parallel on\r\nthe ground, at such a distance apart as to enclose the space necessary\r\nfor the stage. We then marked the places for the post holes, at proper\r\ndistances along the inside of the two beams; there were eight of these\r\npost holes, four on a side.\r\n\r\nThese post holes were dug with a long digging stick, and the dirt\r\nremoved, to the depth of a woman’s arm from the shoulder to the hand;\r\nthat was as far as one could reach down to lift out the dirt. To get the\r\npost holes all of a depth, I took a stick and measured on it the length\r\nof my arm from shoulder to fingers; this stick I used to probe the holes\r\nto see that they were of a proper depth.\r\n\r\nWe now laid down all the posts in a row, and so adjusted them that the\r\nforks that were to receive the floor beams lay all in a straight line;\r\nthat is, if the posts were two-forked posts, all the forks _C_ (figure\r\n32) would lie in a straight line; and if the posts, or some of them, were\r\nsingle-forked posts, their tops would lie in a line with fork _C_ of the\r\ndouble-forked posts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32]\r\n\r\nOn all the posts a charcoal line was now drawn at _A_ (figure 32). The\r\ndistance from _A_ to _B_ (figure 32) should be the length of a woman’s\r\narm, which also was the depth of the post hole. But in cutting the posts,\r\nno matter how careful we were, there was always some irregularity in\r\nlengths so that the part from _A_ to _B_ upon the various posts might\r\nslightly vary.\r\n\r\nAll having now been marked with the charcoal line, the posts were rolled\r\neach to its proper post hole and the part _AB_ on the post was carefully\r\nmeasured and compared with the hole’s depth. For this purpose the stick\r\nused to probe the post holes came again into use. If the length of the\r\npart _AB_ on any post happened to be an inch or two longer than my arm\r\nits post hole was deepened to the same extent. All this was necessary in\r\norder that when the posts were dropped into their holes, the forks that\r\nwere to receive the floor beams would lie all at the same height.\r\n\r\nI have said that a charcoal line was drawn around each post at _A_\r\n(figure 32). The position of this line, after the first one was drawn,\r\nwas obtained by measuring from the fork _C_; and care was taken that the\r\nmeasurements on all the posts should be exactly alike. The charcoal line\r\nquite encircled the post.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Raising the Frame_\r\n\r\nThe posts were now raised and dropped into the post holes; raising was\r\nby hand. The posts were turned so that the forks lay in proper position\r\nto receive the floor beams and upper rails; a two-forked post was placed\r\nwith the prong _C_ (figure 32) turned inward.\r\n\r\nA single-forked post had to have a companion post beside it, also forked,\r\nto support the railing at the top of the stage. This companion post was\r\nnot so heavy, but of course was longer. It stood just beside the main\r\npost and was carefully adjusted to receive the upper rail properly. It\r\nwas lashed to the main post by a green-hide thong.\r\n\r\nThis thong might pass around the shorter post just below its fork; or it\r\nmight bind the companion post to one of the prongs of the fork itself.\r\n\r\nIf I had several two-forked posts and several one-forked posts with\r\ncompanion posts beside them, it required some little bit of fitting to\r\nadjust them all so that the floor beams and rails would lie properly. To\r\nbetter permit this to be done, it was not my custom to firm the earth\r\nabout the post, until the frame had been set up and adjusted; for little\r\nirregularities in the fitting could be cured by slightly moving the posts\r\nas they stood unfirmed, in their holes. When the frame was properly\r\nadjusted, I took my digging stick—it was always a long one that was used\r\nfor digging holes—and rammed the earth around the foot of each post,\r\nfirming it.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of my tribe when digging the post holes, to dig each\r\none just the diameter of its post, or as nearly to it as we could; then\r\nthe posts when raised fitted snugly into the holes.\r\n\r\nThe two long floor beams having been raised into position, the two poles\r\nthat were to make the top railing were also raised. These rails were of\r\nthe same length, but were not so heavy, as the floor beams. We were now\r\nready to lay the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Floor_\r\n\r\nThe floor of the stage was of cottonwood planks. Cottonwood logs, nine\r\nto twelve inches in diameter, had been cut of proper length. Out of the\r\ncenter of each was split a plank, or board, with ax and wedge. These\r\nplanks were laid to make the floor, the ends of the planks resting on the\r\ntwo floor beams that lay on the forks of the posts. We took care to make\r\nthe floor as snug as possible. The planks were carefully fitted together,\r\nand if there was any little crooked place in a plank that left a crack in\r\nthe floor, we stuffed a dry cornstalk into the crack so that no ear of\r\ncorn could fall through.\r\n\r\nThe planks that made the floor were not bound to the floor beams, nor\r\nweighted down in any way; their own weight stayed them in place.\r\n\r\nI have said that the drying stage had to be rebuilt about every three\r\nyears because the posts rotted down in that time. This was not true of\r\nthe floor planks; they lasted much longer and were used year after year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Staying Thongs_\r\n\r\nThe eight posts of the stage stood in pairs, a post on either side of\r\nthe floor; and between the tops of each pair of posts a green-hide thong\r\nwas bound, and left to dry. These thongs stayed the stage and made it\r\nstronger and firmer; often they were also made to bind down the upper\r\nrails to the forks of the posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladder_\r\n\r\nThe stage stood always in front of the earth lodge with its longer side\r\nto the door. A ladder stood at the right hand nigher corner post—as one\r\ncomes out of the lodge—with the foot of the ladder resting a little way\r\nfrom the stage. The top of the ladder leaned against the end of the floor\r\nbeam on the side next the lodge.\r\n\r\nOf course if the ladder were left here with nothing to stay it, it would\r\nfall against the loose planks of the stage floor and force them out of\r\nposition. To prevent this a pole was bound firmly to the two posts _A_\r\nand _B_ (figure 12) and resting on the two floor beams just outside the\r\nposts. The ladder rested against this pole. To receive the pole, the\r\nfloor beams were made to project a little bit forward at the ladder end\r\nof the stage.\r\n\r\nThe ladder was made of a cottonwood trunk, about ten inches in diameter,\r\nwith notches cut in it for steps. At its lower end it was brought to\r\nan edge that it might more firmly rest on the ground and not turn when\r\nsomeone stepped on it. At the upper end a notch was cut in the back to\r\nreceive the end of the floor beam against which the ladder rested. (See\r\nfigure 33.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33]\r\n\r\nThe ladder had always one fixed place; or, if for any reason it had to be\r\nmoved during labors, we took pains to warn our friends. A woman in our\r\nvillage once moved her ladder to another place on her stage and forgot\r\nabout it. When she started to come down she stepped in the old place and\r\nfell and broke both her arms. We did not like to have a ladder removed\r\nfrom its accustomed place for fear of just such accidents.\r\n\r\nWhen the owner descended from her drying stage, she took down her ladder\r\nand laid it on the ground beside the stage. It was not proper for\r\nstrangers to go up on the drying stage, nor were children allowed to go\r\nup there.\r\n\r\nNeighbors sometimes came in and borrowed the ladder; but when not in use,\r\nits proper place was on the ground by the stage.\r\n\r\nYou ask me how we Indian women ascended and descended a ladder. I never\r\nthought of our having any particular custom in this; but now that you\r\ncall my attention to it, I remember that a woman ascended and descended a\r\nladder with her face toward the stage, giving her the appearance of going\r\nup sidewise, and coming down in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIn going up a ladder I usually placed my left foot on the lowest step;\r\nbrought my right foot around in front and over my left to the second\r\nstep; then my left foot past and behind my right foot, with my face\r\ntoward the drying stage. My left hand might or might not touch the\r\nladder, as I was used to ascending it and felt no fear.\r\n\r\nIn descending a ladder I placed my right foot on the highest step, and\r\noverlapped with my left; and so until the bottom was reached.\r\n\r\nI do not know if other women had exactly this custom, for I never\r\nobserved or thought anything about it; but I do know that always,\r\nascending or descending, an Indian woman went sidewise, with her face\r\ntoward the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enlarging the Stage_\r\n\r\nSome years, if our family’s corn crop was very large, we extended our\r\ndrying stage, making it five posts long instead of four posts long, on\r\na side. Other families did likewise, as they had need; one family might\r\nhave corn enough to require a stage five posts long, while another family\r\nneeded one only four posts long, on a side. Stages, indeed, varied in\r\nlength with the needs of the family, but they were all of about the same\r\nwidth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Present Stages_\r\n\r\nThe stage that I have been describing is of the kind that was in use in\r\nmy tribe when I was a young girl of twelve or thirteen years of age. At\r\npresent we no longer use this, our old form, but the Arikara form instead.\r\n\r\nThe Arikara stage differs in having a floor of willows, and is easier to\r\nmake. It took two days to erect a stage of the old fashioned kind, such\r\nas I have been describing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Building, Women’s Work_\r\n\r\nBuilding the drying stage was women’s work, although the men helped raise\r\nthe heavy posts and floor beams. In my father’s family, my two mothers\r\nand I built the stage; but my father also helped us, especially if there\r\nwas any heavy lifting to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Measurements of Stage_\r\n\r\nI will now give you the measurements of such a stage as we used in my\r\nfather’s family.\r\n\r\nPacing it off here, on the ground, the length of the stage was, I think,\r\nabout so long—thirty feet.[20] Its width was about thus—twelve feet.\r\nFrom the ground to the top of the stage floor was a little higher than a\r\nwoman can reach with her hand, or about six feet, six inches; there were\r\nhorses in the village, and the stage floor must be high enough so that\r\nthe horses could not reach the corn. From the floor of the stage to the\r\nupper railing was about so high (holding up a stick), or five feet and\r\nnine inches.\r\n\r\nI will now give you the measurements of the posts and beams; and for\r\nthis, we will use the little model which I have made for you. In this\r\nmodel I have used double-forked posts on one side, and single-forked\r\nposts, with companion posts, on the other side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34]\r\n\r\nIn the diagram (figure 34), _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, are double-forked posts;\r\n_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, are single-forked posts; and _xa_, _xb_, _xc_, _xd_,\r\nare companion posts.\r\n\r\nThe double-forked posts, _A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_, should be about ten\r\ninches in diameter between the lower fork and the ground, but tapering\r\nslightly toward the upper fork. This upper fork, if it was not in the\r\npost naturally, might be cut to receive the upper rail. The posts _a_,\r\n_b_, _c_, and _d_, should be ten inches in diameter; and the companion\r\nposts, _xa_, _xb_, _xc_, and _xd_, should be, perhaps, four inches in\r\ndiameter. All of these posts are set in the ground with the smaller, or\r\nbranch end upward.\r\n\r\nThe floor beams should each be about nine and one-half inches in diameter\r\nat one end, tapering to four or five inches in diameter at the other end.\r\nThis tapering was the natural growth of the trunk; it was not, I mean,\r\ncut tapering with an ax. The beams were so laid that the heavy ends were\r\nalways at the front of the stage as we called it; that is, at the end\r\nwhere the ladder stood.\r\n\r\nThe upper rails were about three and a half inches in diameter. They\r\nwere chosen for strength, if possible of trunks that were branchless, or\r\nnearly so. These upper rails were also laid with the heavy ends toward\r\nthe front, or ladder end, of the stage.\r\n\r\nI have said that if the long posts, _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, had no natural\r\nfork at the top, one was cut; but all other forks, and those also on the\r\ntops of the shorter posts were natural.\r\n\r\nWe took pride in building the stage of well chosen timbers, and in making\r\nthe parts fit snugly. The floor especially was laid as smooth and as\r\nevenly as possible; and here and there, if a crack appeared, a dry corn\r\nstalk was caulked in to make the floor snug and smooth. We were also\r\ncareful to choose straight, well formed trunks for posts and floor beams.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Drying Rods_\r\n\r\nLying across the top of the stage in harvest time, with their ends\r\nresting on the upper rails, were often a number of drying rods. A drying\r\nrod was a pole averaging a little more than two inches in diameter and\r\nabout thirteen feet long, its length permitting six or seven inches to\r\nproject over the rail on which either end rested.\r\n\r\nThese drying rods were much used in harvest time. When old women came\r\nto the stage to slice squashes, they spitted the slices, as I have\r\ndescribed, on willow spits; and these spits again were laid on the drying\r\nrods, each end of a spit resting on one of the rods.\r\n\r\nThe drying rods had other uses. If the day was warm, old women working on\r\nthe floor of the stage would lay two or three of these rods across the\r\nupper rails and throw a buffalo robe over them, and thus have shade while\r\nthey worked. They bound the robe down with thongs to hold it firm.\r\n\r\nWhen not in use the drying rods were laid lengthwise on the floor of the\r\nstage that the wind might not blow them about.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Uses of the Drying Stage_\r\n\r\nBy far the chief use of the drying stage, was to dry our vegetables,\r\nespecially our corn and sliced squashes. Firewood, collected from the\r\nMissouri river in the June rise, was often piled on and under the stage\r\nfloor, to dry.\r\n\r\nThe keepers of the O´kipạ ceremony used to bring out their buffalo head\r\nmasks, and air them on the drying stage that stood before their lodge\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTOOLS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hoe_\r\n\r\nIron hoes had come into general use when I was a girl, but there were\r\ntwo or three old women who used old fashioned bone hoes. I think my\r\ngrandmother, Turtle, was the very last to use one of these bone hoes. I\r\nwill describe the hoe she used, as I remember it.\r\n\r\nThe blade was made of the shoulder bone of a buffalo, with the edge\r\ntrimmed and sharpened; and the ridge of bone, that is found on the\r\nshoulder blade of every animal, was cut off and the place smoothed.\r\n\r\nThe handle of the hoe was split, and grooves were cut in the split to\r\nreceive the bone blade; this was slightly cut to fit and was so set that\r\nthe edge pointed a little backwards.\r\n\r\nRaw-hide thongs bound the split firmly about the blade and a stout thong,\r\nrunning from a groove a little way up the handle, braced the blade in\r\nplace. (See figure 3, page 12).\r\n\r\nUnder my directions, Goodbird has made a hoe such as I saw my grandmother\r\nuse, using the shoulder bone of a steer for a blade. You can make\r\nnecessary measurements from it.\r\n\r\nHoe handles were made of cottonwood or some other light wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rakes_\r\n\r\nWe Hidatsas began our tilling season with the rake.\r\n\r\nWe used two kinds,[21] both of native make; one was made of a\r\nblack-tailed deer horn (figure 5, page 14), the other was of wood (figure\r\n4, page 14).\r\n\r\nOf the two, we thought the horn rake the better, because it did not grow\r\nworms, as we said. Worms often appear in a garden and do much damage. It\r\nis a tradition with us that worms are afraid of horn; and we believed if\r\nwe used black-tailed deer horn rakes, not many worms would be found in\r\nour fields that season.\r\n\r\nWe believed wooden rakes caused worms in the corn. These worms, we\r\nthought, came out of the wood in the rakes; just how this was, we did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nHowever, horn rakes were heavy and rather hard to make; and for this\r\nreason, the handier and more easily made wooden rakes were more commonly\r\nused.\r\n\r\nAll this that I tell you of our tools and fields is our own lore. White\r\nmen taught us none of it. All that I have told you, we Indians knew since\r\nthe world began.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 35]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Squash Knives_\r\n\r\nSquash knives of bone were still in use when I was young. I have often\r\nseen old women using them but, as I recollect, I never saw one being made.\r\n\r\nThe knife was made from the thin part of a buffalo’s shoulder bone;\r\nnever, I think, from the shoulder bone of a deer, elk, or bear.\r\n\r\nThe bone of a buffalo cow was best, because it was thinner. If the squash\r\nknife was too thick, the slices of squash were apt to break as they were\r\nbeing severed from the fruit. Bone squash knives, as I remember, were\r\nused for slicing squashes and for nothing else.\r\n\r\nA squash knife should be cut from green bone; it would then keep an\r\nedge, for green bone is firm and hard. I do not think I ever saw anyone\r\nsharpening a bone knife so far as I can now recollect.\r\n\r\nThere was no handle to a bone squash knife, beyond the natural bone.\r\n\r\nA bone squash knife lasted a long time. Old women in our village who used\r\nthese bone knives, brought them out each summer in the squash harvest.\r\nIt was their habit, I think, to keep the knives in the back part of the\r\nlodge, by the owner’s bed. Whether it was customary to keep the knives in\r\nbags, or in some other receptacle, I do not know.\r\n\r\nMy mothers used a white man’s steel knife for slicing squashes; but as I\r\nhave said, there were old women in the village who still used the older\r\nbone knives.\r\n\r\nYellow Squash, I remember, was one; an old Hidatsa woman named Blossom\r\nwas another; so also was Goes-around-the-end.\r\n\r\nThis model of a squash knife (figure 35) that I have had my son Goodbird\r\nmake for you, is of rather dry bone; I have had him grease it, that it\r\nmay be more like green bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 36\r\n\r\nMAP of GARDENS S.E. of VILLAGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFIELDS AT LIKE-A-FISHHOOK VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n_East-Side Fields_\r\n\r\nFigure 36 is a map I have made of the gardens east, or better, southeast,\r\nof Like-a-fishhook village. The fields lay, as indicated on the map,\r\nupon a point of land that went out into the Missouri river. The map is\r\nonly approximately correct. There were many other gardens than those\r\nrepresented here on the map; for I have made no attempt to indicate any\r\nbut those that lay in the immediate vicinity of the field my family\r\ntilled. These, however, I remember pretty clearly, and believe my map to\r\nbe, as far as it goes, fairly accurate.\r\n\r\nOur family garden is the one marked “Strikes-many-women’s and\r\nBuffalobird-woman’s.” It lay just south of Lone Woman’s and\r\nWant-to-be-a-woman’s. The field was rather irregular at first; a corner\r\nof it, as I have said, was claimed by Lone Woman and Goes-to-next-timber,\r\nas they had started to clear it. My mothers bought out the rights of the\r\nclaimants, in order to keep our field more nearly rectangular, so that we\r\ncould count our Indian acres more accurately. This corner is marked by a\r\ndotted line, on the map.\r\n\r\nI remember that when I was a little girl, the boundaries of the field\r\nwere rather irregular at first; and my grandmother, Turtle, would go\r\nalong the edge with her digging stick and dig up the ground to make the\r\ncorners come out more nearly squared, and the sides of the field be\r\nstraightened.\r\n\r\nThe field was also enlarged from year to year toward the sides; and much\r\nof this work my grandmother did with her digging stick. The garden when\r\ncompleted was the largest ever owned in my family; it was this field\r\nwhose size I measured off for you on the prairie the other day.\r\n\r\nThe village gardens varied in size. Some families tilled large fields;\r\nothers rather small ones. Some families did not work very energetically;\r\nand these were often put to it to have food. Other families worked hard,\r\nand always had a plenty. Families were not all equally industrious.\r\n\r\nThere were no watchers’ stages nor booths in these east-side fields. The\r\nground rose in a shelf, or bluff, just north of the gardens; from this\r\nshelf the watchers could watch their fields and sing to the growing corn\r\nwithout the trouble of having to build stages.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the east-side gardens was bottom land and prairie, with\r\nlittle or no timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_East Side Fences_\r\n\r\nOur fields on the east-side of the village were fenced, as will be seen\r\nfrom the map. The fences were made thus:\r\n\r\nPosts were cut of any kind of wood two or three inches in diameter and\r\nforked at the top. These were set in holes, at distances about as we now\r\nuse for corral posts, or twelve feet from post to post. Posts were sunk\r\nthe length of my forearm and fingers into the ground. Holes were made\r\nwith digging stick and knife, and the dirt drawn out by hand.\r\n\r\nRails were laid in the forks of the posts and bound down with strips of\r\nbark; elm bark was strongest, but other kinds were used. The railing thus\r\nmade ran about three and a half feet from the ground, the height of the\r\nposts that upheld it. All the rails were peeled of bark.\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made to firm the structure, as we did our drying stages.\r\nOur object was but to keep out the horses, and if the fence was strong\r\nenough to withstand the winds we thought that enough.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the map, some of the fields were fenced quite\r\naround; but this was done only when the field was isolated. When several\r\ngardens adjoined, a single fence usually ran around them all, and not\r\naround each individual field.\r\n\r\nWhen several gardens were enclosed in a single fence, each owner looked\r\nafter that part of the fence that bordered her own land, and kept it in\r\nrepair.\r\n\r\nWe did not run our fences close to the boundary of our gardens as white\r\nmen do. As we built our fences chiefly to keep horses out of the gardens,\r\nwe placed them far enough away so that even if the horses approached the\r\nfence, they could not reach over and nibble the growing corn.\r\n\r\nI think our fences stood twelve or fifteen feet away from the cultivated\r\nground, as I pace it here on the ground. I know no reason why they were\r\nrun thus, except as I have said, to keep the horses from nibbling the\r\ncorn. You see, fifteen feet is quite a little distance; and the fence\r\ncould have stood closer to the cultivated ground and still been far\r\nenough away to keep the horses from nibbling the crops. All I know is,\r\nthat it was a custom of my tribe, and I always followed this custom if I\r\nhad a fence to build.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the map, the corners of the fences were turned rather\r\nround; not built squared, as white men build their fences. We could not\r\nsquare the corners as white men do when they build wire fences, because\r\nwe could not lay the rails in the forks of the posts and bind them down\r\nfirmly if we did so. Perhaps that is the reason we ran the fences so far\r\nfrom the cultivated ground, that the fence, turning the corners, might\r\nnot invade the cultivated ground—if you will look at the map you will see\r\nwhat I mean. However, I do not know if this is the reason or not.\r\n\r\nHorses did not trouble us much, as we did not permit them to graze near\r\nour garden lands; they were pastured on the prairie.\r\n\r\nWe always had fences around our fields as long ago as I know anything\r\nabout; and I have heard that our tribe had such fences in the villages\r\nthey built at the mouth of the Knife River, to protect their fields\r\nthere from their horses. Such, I have heard, has been our Indian custom\r\nsince the world began.\r\n\r\nAt the very first it is true, we did not own ponies; but we soon got them.\r\n\r\nI think my tribe obtained ponies from the western tribes. In my own youth\r\nwe Hidatsas got many of our horses from western tribes, especially from\r\nthe Crows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Idikita´c’s Garden_\r\n\r\nOn the map there appears a garden marked as belonging to a woman named\r\nIdikita´c. She made her garden after all the others had been fenced in.\r\nThere was a road that went down to some June-berry and choke-cherry\r\npatches, in the small timber that stood beyond the gardens; it was a mere\r\npath used by villagers afoot, by women with their dogs, and sometimes by\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\nNow, Idikita´c laid out her field so that it enclosed a small section\r\nof this road; and she built a fence around it and tried to keep the\r\nvillagers from going across her land. The people did not like this.\r\nIdikita´c would tie up her fence tight, but the villagers going down to\r\nthe choke-cherry patch, would go right through her garden, following the\r\nroad that had been there; sometimes they even went through with horses.\r\n\r\n“You must not make your garden here,” the people said to Idikita´c, “this\r\nis a road!”\r\n\r\nAnd Idikita´c answered, “I do not want you to do damage to my garden!”\r\n\r\nThere was quite a deal of talk in the village about this matter, and\r\nquite a bit of trouble came of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fields West of the Village_\r\n\r\nThe first field cleared by my father’s family on the west side of the\r\nvillage, is that marked _A_, on the plot legended with Turtle’s name, on\r\nthe map (figure 37), which I have had my son Goodbird draw for you of\r\nour west-side fields. A coulee bordered one end of the field; and in the\r\nrainy months the water washed out much of the good soil. Willows growing\r\nup along the edge of the coulee also gave us much trouble. We therefore\r\nextended our field to the other side of the coulee, to include the part\r\nmarked _B_.\r\n\r\nAfterwards we added another field, marked on the map with my name,\r\nMaxi´diwiac.\r\n\r\nIn Turtle’s garden there was a watchers’ stage, _C_, with a tree beside\r\nit. There was also a booth, _D_.\r\n\r\nPeppermint and Yellow Hair had each a watchers’ stage and a booth in\r\nher garden, as indicated on the map. Another stage and a tree stood in\r\na garden near by, the name of whose owner I have now forgotten. I have\r\nmarked the position of stage and tree in each field only approximately\r\nexcept in Turtle’s garden; as this was one of our own family fields, I\r\nremember the position of stage and tree very accurately.\r\n\r\nIn this map, as in that of the east-side gardens, I have indicated only\r\nthe fields that lay in the vicinity of those cultivated by my own family;\r\nthere were many others, but I can not, after so many years, accurately\r\nmark their positions, nor tell the names of the owners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 37]\r\n\r\n\r\n_West-Side Fence_\r\n\r\nA fence protected our west-side gardens also, but only on the side\r\nnearest the village, probably because the horses could be expected to\r\ncome from that direction. This fence differed somewhat from those on the\r\neast side.\r\n\r\nThe fence was built thus:\r\n\r\nA heavy stick was sharpened at one end and driven into the ground with an\r\nax; it was loosened by working it from side to side with the hands, and\r\nwithdrawn, leaving a hole about a foot deep.\r\n\r\nInto this hole was thrust a diamond willow, butt end downward, for post.\r\nThe long tapering top with the twigs and leaves still on it, was bent\r\nover and around a rail (that was raised into position for the purpose)\r\nand then twisted around the post and tied down with bark. A second rail\r\nwas bound to the post below the first. The sketch on the map gives an\r\nidea of what is meant, and in figure 38 is sketch and diagram by Goodbird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 38\r\n\r\nReproduced from sketch by Goodbird. On the left is post newly placed with\r\nfoliage intact. On the right is post with foliage omitted to show how top\r\nwas bound down over rails.]\r\n\r\nThis fence was nearly or quite shoulder high to a woman, or about four\r\nfeet; and the posts were about two feet apart, so that even a traveller\r\ngoing afoot could not squeeze his way between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crops, Our First Wagon_\r\n\r\nThe first wagon owned in my tribe belonged to Had-many-antelopes. My\r\nfather hired him for a pair of trousers to haul in the corn from our\r\ngardens, one year. Had-many-antelopes fetched in three wagon loads from\r\nmy garden; the field I mean, marked with my name; and three more wagon\r\nloads from the field _A_, in Turtle’s garden. From the field _B_, in\r\nTurtle’s garden, the family fetched the corn that year, for that field\r\nwe had planted all to sweet corn; not gummy corn, but corn planted to\r\nhalf-boil and dry, for winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEA\r\n\r\n\r\n_Divisions Between Gardens_\r\n\r\nWhen two-fields adjoined the dividing space, or ground that ran between\r\nthem, we called maạdupatska´; it was always about four feet wide.\r\n\r\nThe word really means, I think, a raised ridge of earth. We still use the\r\nword in this sense. Down by the government school house at Independence,\r\nour agent has run a road; and the earth dug out of the roadway has been\r\npiled along the side in a low ridge to get rid of it. This ridge, running\r\nalong the side of the road, we call maạdupatska´.\r\n\r\nBut the maạdupatska´ dividing two gardens in old times was never raised\r\nin a ridge. It was nothing but a four-foot-wide dividing line. Nothing\r\ngrew on it. Each gardener hoed her half of the maạdupatska´ to keep it\r\nclean of grass and weeds. We were particular about this; we did not want\r\nto have any weeds in our gardens.\r\n\r\nI do not mean that I, for example, was accustomed to hoe exactly one\r\nhalf of the maạdupatska´ that bordered my garden, leaving exactly the\r\nother half to my neighbor. I merely hoed as needed, and my neighbor did\r\nlikewise; but the work was pretty equally divided, each woman recognizing\r\nthat she should do her share.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the owner of a garden would come to her next neighbor\r\nand say, “I do not want you to have any hard feelings, nor speak against\r\nme; but I want to plant the maạdupatska´ that divides our gardens, in\r\nsquash;” or instead of squash, she might want to plant it in sunflowers\r\nor beans.\r\n\r\nPermission being given, she would plant as she had requested; and\r\nthereafter, of course, she would hoe all the maạdupatska´, because she\r\nhad a crop standing on it. But even then the ground would not be hers,\r\nand her neighbor might refuse the permission asked.\r\n\r\nI have said that it might be asked to plant squash, or beans, or\r\nsunflowers. A gardener never asked to plant corn on the maạdupatska´ that\r\nbordered her field. Rows of corn hills should be about four feet apart;\r\nand as this was the width of the maạdupatska´, even a single row of hills\r\nwould have crowded the corn; but beans or squashes or sunflowers planted\r\non the maạdupatska´ did not do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fallowing, Ownership of Gardens_\r\n\r\nThe first crop on new ground was always the best, though the second was\r\nnearly as good. The third year’s crop was not so good; and after that,\r\neach year, the crop grew less, until in some seasons, especially in a dry\r\nsummer, hardly anything was produced.\r\n\r\nThe owners then stopped cultivating the garden and let it lie for two\r\nyears; the third year they again planted the garden and found it would\r\nyield a good crop as before. During the two years their garden lay\r\nfallow, the family owning it would plant their season’s crop elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn my father’s family we owned garden lands both on the east and on the\r\nwest side of the village, as I have told you in explaining the two maps\r\nmade for you. This made it easy, if need arose, to work one garden while\r\nwe let the other rest. There were families in the village who owned more\r\nfields even, than did my father’s household.\r\n\r\nSometimes when a woman died, her relatives did not trouble themselves to\r\nwork her garden for a couple of years, but just let it rest; then they\r\nwould begin planting it again, and the ground was sure to bring forth a\r\ngood crop. I think our custom of fallowing ground may have arisen in this\r\nway. When a woman died leaving a garden, and her relatives did not at\r\nonce take possession, it was found that a two years’ rest increased the\r\nyield; and so the custom of fallowing, perhaps, arose. Every one in the\r\nvillage knew the value of a two years’ fallowing.\r\n\r\nGround that was newly broken produced good crops for a long time. Our\r\nfamily’s west side garden once got to producing very poor crops; and we\r\nlet it lie untilled for two years. I do not recollect how long it was\r\nbefore we let it rest again.\r\n\r\nThere was no rule how long we should use land before we fallowed it; nor\r\nwas there any rule that we should let it rest for just two years. We\r\nmerely knew that two years’ rest brought a poorly producing field back\r\ninto good condition.\r\n\r\nSometimes a woman died and her garden was abandoned by her relatives, who\r\nperhaps had more land than they could use. For this and other causes,\r\nthere were always some of the cultivated lands of the village lying\r\nvacant. We never had all our fields in use every year; there were always\r\nsome lying untilled, either for fallowing, or for some other reason.\r\n\r\nIf a woman died and her relatives did not care to till her garden, it was\r\nfree to any one who cared to make use of it. However, if a woman desired\r\nto take possession of such an abandoned field, it was thought right that\r\nshe should ask permission of the dead owner’s relatives. Permission might\r\nbe asked of the dead woman’s son, or daughter, her mother, her husband’s\r\nsister, or of the husband himself.\r\n\r\nThe woman did not wait two years before asking; if she wanted the dead\r\nwoman’s field, she just went to the relatives and asked for it.\r\n\r\nWhen the owner of a field died, I never heard that her relatives ever\r\nsold it; if they did not care to use it themselves, they gave it to some\r\none who did, or let it lie abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frost in the Gardens_\r\n\r\nThe fields that lay on the west side of our village got frosted more\r\neasily than those on the east side. Indeed, our west-side gardens\r\nsuffered a good deal from frost.\r\n\r\nThe reason was that the ground along the Missouri was lower on the west\r\nside of the village; and fields that lay on lower ground, we knew, were\r\nmore likely to get frosted than those on higher ground. Gardens on the\r\nhigher grounds east of the village were seldom touched by frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maxi´diwiac’s Philosophy of Frost_\r\n\r\nFields lying on lower ground catch frost more easily than those that lie\r\nhigher. On a warm day, the ground becomes warmed; but at night cool air\r\ncomes up out of the ground, and we can see that where it meets the warm\r\nair above, it creates a kind of snow [hoar frost].\r\n\r\nAlso, some days the wind is high; and toward evening it dies down. The\r\nhot airs are then sucked down into the ground and cause moisture to rise\r\nup out of the ground in steam. Afterwards, if the cool air comes up out\r\nof the ground and meets that hot air, it makes a kind of snow on the\r\nweeds and corn, killing them. But you can not see this steam until the\r\ncold air arises; then it becomes visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Men Helping in the Field_\r\n\r\nDid young men work in the fields? (laughing heartily.) Certainly not! The\r\nyoung men should be off hunting, or on a war party; and youths not yet\r\nyoung men should be out guarding the horses. Their duties were elsewhere,\r\nalso they spent a great deal of time dressing up to be seen of the\r\nvillage maidens; they should not be working in the fields!\r\n\r\nBut old men, too old to go to war, went out into the fields and helped\r\ntheir wives. It was theirs to plant the corn while the women made the\r\nhills; and they also helped pull up weeds.[22]\r\n\r\nWhen their sweethearts were working in the fields, young men often came\r\nout and talked to them, and maybe worked a little. However, it was not\r\nmuch real work that they did; they were but seeking a chance to talk,\r\neach with his sweetheart.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sucking the Sweet Juice_\r\n\r\nWhen the first green corn was plucked, we Indian women often broke off a\r\npiece of the stalk and sucked it for the sweet juice it contained. We did\r\nthis merely for a little taste of sweets in the field; we never took the\r\ngreen stalks home to use as food at our meals.\r\n\r\nDid old men do this, you ask? (laughing.) How could they, with their\r\nteeth all worn down? Old men could not chew such hard stuff!\r\n\r\nNo, just women and children did this—sucked the green corn stalks for the\r\njuice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corn as Fodder for Horses_\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the harvest season, when we plucked green corn to\r\nboil, we gathered the ears first; afterwards we gathered the green stalks\r\nfrom which the ears had been stripped. These stalks with the leaves on\r\nthem we fed to our horses, either without the lodge, or inside, in the\r\ncorral.\r\n\r\nWe commonly husked our corn, as I have said, out in the fields, piling up\r\nthe husks in a heap. After the corn was all in, we drove our horses to\r\nthe field to eat both the standing fodder and the husks that lay heaped\r\nnear the husking place. Horses readily ate corn fodder, and by the time\r\nspring came again, there was little left in the field; not only were the\r\nhusks devoured, but most of the standing stalks were eaten off nearly or\r\nquite to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Disposition of Weeds_\r\n\r\nWeeds that we cut down in hoeing a field, we let lie on the ground if\r\nthey were young weeds and bore no seeds nor blossoms, but if the weeds\r\nhad seeded, we bore them off the garden about fifteen or twenty yards\r\nfrom the cultivated ground and left them to rot.\r\n\r\nIn olden times we Indian women let no weeds grow in our gardens. I was\r\nvery particular about keeping my own garden clean all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Spring Clean-up_\r\n\r\nWe never bothered to burn weeds; but in the spring we always cleaned up\r\nour fields before planting. We pulled up the stubs of corn stalks and\r\nroots, and piled them with the previous year’s bean vines and sunflower\r\nstalks, in the middle of the garden and burned them; this was commonly\r\ndone at the husking place, where the husks had been piled. There was not\r\na great deal of refuse left from the corn crop, however, as the horses\r\nhad eaten most of it for fodder in the previous fall; but bean vines they\r\nwould not eat.\r\n\r\nI never saw any one fire their corn stalks in the fall. Our yearly\r\nclean-up was always in the spring, when every field must be raked and\r\ncleaned before planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manure_\r\n\r\nWe Hidatsas did not like to have the dung of animals in our fields. The\r\nhorses we turned into our gardens in the fall dropped dung; and where\r\nthey did so, we found little worms and insects. We also noted that where\r\ndung fell, many kinds of weeds grew up the next year.\r\n\r\nWe did not like this, and we therefore carefully cleaned off the dried\r\ndung, picking it up by hand and throwing it ten feet or more beyond the\r\nedge of the garden plot. We did likewise with the droppings of white\r\nmen’s cattle, after they were brought to us.\r\n\r\nThe dung of horses and cattle raised sharp thistles, the kind that grows\r\nup in a big bush; and mustard, and another plant that has black seeds.\r\nThese three kinds of weeds came to us with the white man; other weeds we\r\nhad before, but they were native to our land.\r\n\r\nOur corn and other vegetables can not grow on land that has many weeds.\r\nNow that white men have come and put manure on their fields, these\r\nstrange weeds brought by them have become common. In old times we\r\nHidatsas kept our gardens clean of weeds. I think this is harder to do\r\nnow that we have so many more kinds of weeds.\r\n\r\nI do not know that the worms in the manure did any harm to our gardens;\r\nbut because we thought it bred worms and weeds, we did not like to have\r\nany dung on our garden lands; and we therefore removed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Worms_\r\n\r\nOur corn, we knew, raised a good many worms. They came out in the ears;\r\nit was the corn kernels that became the worms. Wood also became worms.\r\nLeaves became worms. All these bred worms of themselves.\r\n\r\nI knew also, when I was a young woman, that flies lay eggs, that after a\r\ntime the eggs move about alive; and that later these put on wings and fly\r\naway. Whether all flies do this, I did not know, but I knew that some do.\r\n\r\nMany worms appeared in our gardens in some years; in other years they\r\nwere fewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wild Animals_\r\n\r\nDid buffaloes or deer ever raid our gardens? (laughing.) No. Buffaloes\r\nhave keen scent, and they could wind an Indian a long way off. While they\r\ncould smell us Indian people, or the smoke from our village, there was no\r\ndanger that they would come near to eat our crops.\r\n\r\nAntelopes lived out on the plains, in the open country; they never came\r\nnear our fields.\r\n\r\nRocky Mountain sheep lived in the clay hills, in the very roughest\r\ncountry, where cedar trees and sage brush grow.\r\n\r\nBlack-tailed deer lived far away in the Bad Lands, in the little round\r\npatches of timber that are found there, where the country is very rough.\r\nThey were not found near our village, nor in such places as those in\r\nwhich we planted our gardens.\r\n\r\nWhite-tailed deer, however, lived in the heavy timber that lines the\r\nbanks of the Missouri river. A few are still found on this reservation.\r\nHowever, though haunting the woods near our gardens, these deer never\r\nmolested our crops; they never ate our corn ears nor nibbled the stalks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_About Old Tent Covers_\r\n\r\nI have said that we made the threshing booth under the drying stage of an\r\nold tent cover.\r\n\r\nBuffalo hides that we wanted to use for making tent covers, were taken in\r\nthe spring when the buffaloes shed their hair and their skins are thin.\r\nThe skin tent cover which we then made would be used all that summer;\r\nand the next winter, perhaps, we would begin to cut it up for moccasins.\r\nThe following spring, again, we could take more buffalo hides and make\r\nanother tent cover.\r\n\r\nNot all families renewed a tent so often. Some families used a tent two\r\nyears, and some even a much longer time; but many families used a tent\r\ncover but a single season. It was a very usual thing for the women of a\r\nfamily to make a new tent cover, in the spring.\r\n\r\nOld tent covers, as I have said, were cut up for moccasins, or they were\r\nput to other uses. There was always a good deal of need about the lodge\r\nfor skins that had been scraped bare of hair; and the skins in a tent\r\ncover were, of course, of this kind. Every bed in the earth lodge, in old\r\ntimes, was covered with an old tent cover.\r\n\r\nSkins needed in threshing time were partly of these bed covers, taken\r\ndown from the beds. Often the piece of an old tent cover from which\r\nwe had been cutting moccasins would be brought out and used. Then we\r\ncommonly had other buffalo hides, scraped bare of hair, stored in the\r\nlodge, ready for any use.\r\n\r\nBuffaloes were plentiful in those days, and skins were easy to get. We\r\nhad always abundance for use in threshing time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSINCE WHITE MEN CAME\r\n\r\n\r\n_How We Got Potatoes and Other Vegetables_\r\n\r\nThe government has changed our old way of cultivating corn and our other\r\nvegetables, and has brought us seeds of many new vegetables and grains,\r\nand taught us their use. We Hidatsas and our friends, the Mandans, have\r\nalso been removed from our village at Like-a-fishhook bend, and made to\r\ntake our land in allotments; so that our old agriculture has in a measure\r\nfallen into disuse.\r\n\r\nI was thirty-three years old when the government first plowed up fields\r\nfor us; two big fields were broken, one between the village and the\r\nagency, and another on the farther side of the agency.\r\n\r\nNew kinds of seeds were issued to us, oats and wheat; and we were made to\r\nplant them in these newly plowed fields. Another field was plowed for us\r\ndown in the bottom land along the Missouri; and here we were taught to\r\nplant potatoes. Each family was given a certain number of rows to plant\r\nand cultivate.\r\n\r\nAt first we Hidatsas did not like potatoes, because they smelled so\r\nstrongly! Then we sometimes dug up our potatoes and took them into our\r\nearth lodges; and when cold weather came, the potatoes were frozen, and\r\nspoiled. For these reasons we did not take much interest in our potatoes,\r\nand often left them in the ground, not bothering to dig them.\r\n\r\nOther seeds were issued to us, of watermelons, big squashes, onions,\r\nturnips, and other vegetables. Some of these we tried to eat, but did not\r\nlike them very well; even the turnips and big squashes, we thought not so\r\ngood as our own squashes and our wild prairie turnips. Moreover, we did\r\nnot know how to dry these new vegetables for winter; so we often did not\r\ntrouble even to harvest them.\r\n\r\nThe government was eager to teach the Indians to raise potatoes; and to\r\nget us women to cultivate them, paid as much as two dollars and a half a\r\nday for planting them in the plowed field. I remember I was paid that sum\r\nfor planting them. After three or four years, finding the Indians did not\r\nhave much taste for potatoes and rather seldom ate them, our agent made\r\na big cache pit—a root cellar you say it was—and bought our potato crop\r\nof us. After this he would issue seed potatoes to us in the spring, and\r\nin the fall we would sell our crop to him. Thus, handling potatoes each\r\nyear, we learned little by little to eat them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The New Cultivation_\r\n\r\nThe government also broke up big fields of prairie ground, and had us\r\nplant corn in them; but these fields on the prairie near the hills I do\r\nnot think are so good as our old fields down in the timber lands along\r\nthe Missouri. The prairie fields get dry easily and the soil is harder\r\nand more difficult to work.\r\n\r\nThen I think our old way of raising corn is better than the new way\r\ntaught us by white men. Last year, 1911, our agent held an agricultural\r\nfair on this reservation; and we Indians competed for prizes for the best\r\ncorn. The corn which I sent to the fair took the first prize. I raised\r\nit on new ground; the ground had been plowed, but aside from that, I\r\ncultivated the corn exactly as in old times, with a hoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Iron Kettles_\r\n\r\nThe first pots, or kettles, of metal that we Hidatsas got were of yellow\r\ntin [brass]; the French and the Crees also traded us kettles made of red\r\ntin [copper].\r\n\r\nAs long as we could get our native clay pots, we of my father’s family\r\ndid not use metal pots much, because the metal made the food taste. When\r\nI was a little girl, if any of us went to visit another family, and they\r\ngave us food cooked in an iron pot, we knew it at once because we could\r\ntaste and smell the iron in the food.\r\n\r\nI have said that we began cooking food in an iron kettle in my father’s\r\nfamily when I was about eighteen years old; but the great iron kettle\r\nthat lies in Goodbird’s yard was given us by an Arikara woman before I\r\nwas born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTOBACCO\r\n\r\n\r\n_Observations by Maxi´diwiac_\r\n\r\nTobacco was cultivated in my tribe only by old men. Our young men did not\r\nsmoke much; a few did, but most of them used little tobacco, or almost\r\nnone. They were taught that smoking would injure their lungs and make\r\nthem short winded so that they would be poor runners. But when a man got\r\nto be about sixty years of age we thought it right for him to smoke as\r\nmuch as he liked. His war days and hunting days were over. Old men smoked\r\nquite a good deal.\r\n\r\nYoung men who used tobacco could run; but in a short time they became\r\nshort of breath, and water, thick like syrup, came up into the mouth. A\r\nyoung man who smoked a great deal, if chased by enemies, could not run to\r\nescape from them, and so got killed. For this reason all the young men of\r\nmy tribe were taught that they should not smoke.\r\n\r\nThings have changed greatly since those good days; and now young and old,\r\nboys and men, all smoke. They seem to think that the new ways of the\r\nwhite man are right; but I do not. In olden days, we Hidatsas took good\r\ncare of our bodies, as is not done now.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tobacco Garden_\r\n\r\nThe old men of my tribe who smoked had each a tobacco garden planted\r\nnot very far away from our corn fields, but never in the same plot\r\nwith one. Two of these tobacco gardens were near the village, upon the\r\ntop of some rising ground; they were owned by two old men, Bad Horn\r\nand Bear-looks-up. The earth lodges of these old men stood a little\r\nway out of the village, and their tobacco gardens were not far away.\r\nBear-looks-up called my father “brother” and I often visited his lodge.\r\n\r\nTobacco gardens, as I remember them, were almost universal in my tribe\r\nwhen I was five or six years of age; they were still commonly planted\r\nwhen I was twelve years old; but white men had been bringing in their\r\ntobacco and selling it at the traders’ stores for some years, and our\r\ntobacco gardens were becoming neglected.\r\n\r\nAs late as when I was sixteen, my father still kept his tobacco garden;\r\nbut since that day individual gardens have not been kept in my tribe.\r\nInstead, just a little space in the vegetable garden is planted with seed\r\nif the owner wishes to raise tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe seed we use is the same that we planted in old times. A big insect\r\nthat we call the “tobacco blower” used always to be found around our\r\ntobacco gardens; and this insect still appears about the little patches\r\nof tobacco that we plant.\r\n\r\nThe reason that tobacco gardens were planted apart from our vegetable\r\nfields in old times was, that the tobacco plants have a strong smell\r\nwhich affects the corn; if tobacco is planted near the corn, the growing\r\ncorn stalks turn yellow and the corn is not so good. Tobacco plants were\r\ntherefore kept out of our corn fields. We do not follow this custom now;\r\nand I do not think our new way is as good for the corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Planting_\r\n\r\nTobacco seed was planted at the same time sunflower seed was planted.\r\n\r\nThe owner took a hoe and made soft every foot of the tobacco garden; and\r\nwith a rake he made the loosened soil level and smooth.\r\n\r\nHe marked the ground with a stick into rows about eighteen inches apart.\r\nHe opened a little package of seed, poured the seed into his left palm,\r\nand with his right sowed the seed very thickly in the row. He covered the\r\nnewly sowed seed very lightly with soil which he raked with his hand.\r\n\r\nWhen rain came, and warmth, the seeds sprouted. The seed having been\r\nplanted thickly, the plants came up thickly, so that they had to be\r\nthinned out. The owner of the garden would weed out the weak plants,\r\nleaving only the stronger standing.\r\n\r\nThe earth about each plant was hilled up about it with a buffalo rib,\r\ninto a little hill like a corn hill. It was a common thing to see an\r\nold man working in his tobacco garden with one of these ribs. Young men\r\nseldom worked in the tobacco gardens; not using tobacco very much, they\r\ncared little about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrow-head-earring’s Tobacco Garden_\r\n\r\nAn old man, I remember, named Arrow-head-earring, or Ma´iạ-pokcahec, had\r\na patch of tobacco along the edge of a field on the east side of the\r\nvillage. He was a very old man. He used a big buffalo rib, sharpened on\r\nthe edge, to work the soil and cultivate his tobacco. He caught the rib\r\nin his hands by both ends with the edge downward; and stooping over,\r\nhe scraped the soil toward him, now and then raising the rib up and\r\nloosening the earth with the point at one end—poking up the soil, so to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nHe wore no shirt as he worked; but he had a buffalo robe about his\r\nmiddle, on which he knelt as he worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Small Ankle’s Cultivation_\r\n\r\nMy father always attended to the planting of his tobacco garden. When the\r\nseed sprouted he thinned out the plants, weeded the ground and hilled up\r\nthe tobacco plants later with his own hands.\r\n\r\nTobacco plants often came up wild from seed dropped by the cultivated\r\nplants. These wild plants seemed just as good as the cultivated ones.\r\nThere seemed little preference between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting the Blossoms_\r\n\r\nTobacco plants began to blossom about the middle of June; and picking\r\nthen began. Tobacco was gathered in two harvests. The first harvest was\r\nof these blossoms, which we reckoned the best part of the plant for\r\nsmoking. Old men were fond of smoking them.\r\n\r\nBlossoms were picked regularly every fourth day after the season set in.\r\nIf we neglected to pick them until the fifth day, the blossoms would\r\nbegin to seed.\r\n\r\nThis picking of the blossoms my father often did, but as he was old, and\r\nthe work was slow and took a long time, my sister and I used to help him.\r\n\r\nI well remember how my sister and I used to go out in late summer, when\r\nthe plants were in bloom, and gather the white blossoms. These I would\r\npluck from the plants, pinching them off with my thumb nail. Picking\r\nblossoms was tedious work. The tobacco got into one’s eyes and made them\r\nsmart just as white men’s onions do to-day.\r\n\r\nWe picked, as I have said, every fourth day. Only the green part of the\r\nblossom was kept. The white part I always threw away; it was of no value.\r\n\r\nTo receive the blossoms I took a small basket with me to the garden.\r\nThere were two kinds used; one was the bark basket that we wove, and of\r\nwhich you have specimens; the other kind was made of a buffalo bull’s\r\nscrotum, with hair side out.\r\n\r\nSuch a basket as the latter was a little larger than the crown of a\r\nwhite man’s hat, the hat band being about the same diameter as the rim\r\nthat we put on the basket. It had the usual band to go over forehead or\r\nshoulders. I bore the basket in the usual way on my back; or I could\r\nswing it around on my breast when actually picking, thus making it easy\r\nto drop the blossoms into it.\r\n\r\nMore often, however, I took the basket off and set it on the ground when\r\nplucking blossoms. I would make a little round place in the soft soil\r\nwith my hands and set the basket in it, so that it would stand upright.\r\nThe basket did not collapse, for the skin covering was tough and rigid,\r\nnot soft.\r\n\r\nI often used the scrotum basket also for picking choke-cherries or June\r\nberries. It was more convenient when berrying to carry the basket swung\r\naround on my breast. Going home with the basket filled with berries, I\r\nbore it in the usual way on my back.\r\n\r\nMy father usually worked with us; and indeed it was to help him, because\r\nhe was old, that we picked the blossoms at all. It was slow work. I did\r\nnot expect to gather more than a fourth of a small basketful every four\r\ndays; and as the blossoms shrunk a good deal in drying, a day’s picking\r\nlooked rather scant.\r\n\r\nWhen we fetched the blossoms home to the lodge, my father would spread a\r\ndry hide on the floor in front of his sacred objects of the Big Birds’\r\nceremony; they were two skulls and a sacred pipe, wrapped in a bundle and\r\nlying on a kind of stand. We regarded these objects as a kind of shrine.\r\nNobody ever walked between the fire and the shrine as that would have\r\nbeen a kind of disrespect to the gods. My father spread the new-plucked\r\nblossoms on the hide to dry. Lying here before the shrine, it was certain\r\nno one would forget and step on the blossoms.\r\n\r\nIt took quite a time to dry the blossoms. If the weather was damp and\r\nmurky for several days, my father, on appearance of the sun again, would\r\nmove the hide over to a place where the sun shining through the smoke\r\nhole, would fall on the blossoms. The smoke hole, being rather large,\r\nwould let through quite a strong sunbeam, and the drying blossoms were\r\nkept directly in the beam.\r\n\r\nWhen the blossoms had quite dried, my father fetched them over near the\r\nfireplace, and put them on a small skin, or on a plank. We commonly had\r\nplanks, or boards, split from cottonwood trunks, lying in the lodge; they\r\nhad many uses.\r\n\r\nMy father then took a piece of buffalo fat, thrust it on the end of a\r\nstick and roasted it slowly over the coals. This piece of hot fat he\r\ntouched lightly here and there to the piled-up blossoms, so as to oil\r\nthem slightly, but not too much. He next moved the skin or board down\r\nover the edge of the fire pit, tipping it slightly so that the heat from\r\nthe fire would strike the blossoms. Here he left them a little while, but\r\nwatching them all the time. Now and then he would gently stir the pile\r\nof blossoms with a little stick, so that the whole mass might be oiled\r\nequally.\r\n\r\nThis done my father took up the blossoms and put them into his tobacco\r\nbag. The tobacco bag that we used then was exactly like that used to-day,\r\nornamented with quills or bead work; only in those days old men never\r\nbothered to ornament their tobacco bags, just having them plain.\r\n\r\nWhen my father wanted to smoke these dried blossoms, he drew them from\r\nhis tobacco bag and chopped them fine with a knife, a pipeful at a time.\r\nCured in this way, tobacco blossoms were called ạduatạkidu´cki. They were\r\nsmoked by old men unmixed.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms were always dried within the lodge. If dried without, the\r\nsun and air took away their strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Harvesting the Plants_\r\n\r\nAbout harvest time, just before frost came, the rest of the plants were\r\ngathered—the stems and leaves, I mean, left after the harvesting of the\r\nblossoms. My father attended to this. He took no basket, but fetched the\r\nplants in his arms.\r\n\r\nHe dried the plants in the lodge near the place where the cache pit lay.\r\nFor this he took sticks, about fifteen inches long, and thrust them over\r\nthe beam between two of the exterior supporting posts, so that the sticks\r\npointed a little upwards. On each of these sticks he hung two or three\r\ntobacco plants by thrusting the plants, root up, upon the stick, but\r\nwithout tying them.\r\n\r\nWhen dry, these plants were taken down and put into a bag; or a package\r\nwas made by folding over them a piece of old tent cover; and the package\r\nor bag was stored away in the cache pit.\r\n\r\nWhen the tobacco plants were quite dry, the leaves readily fell off.\r\nLeaves that remained on the plants were smoked, of course; but it was\r\nthe stems that furnished most of the smoking. They were treated like the\r\nblossoms, with buffalo fat, before putting into the tobacco pouch; we did\r\nnot treat tobacco with buffalo fat except as needed for use, and to be\r\nput into the tobacco pouch, ready for smoking.\r\n\r\nI do not remember that my father ever saved any of the blossoms to store\r\naway in the cache pit, as he did the stem, or plant tobacco. Friends and\r\nvisitors were always coming and going; and when they came into the lodge\r\nmy father would smoke with them, using the blossoms first, because they\r\nwere his best tobacco. In this way, the blossoms were used up about as\r\nfast as they were gathered.\r\n\r\nBefore putting the tobacco away in the cache pit, my father was careful\r\nto put aside seed for the next year’s planting. He gathered the black\r\nseeds into a small bundle about as big as my fingers bunched together, or\r\nabout the size of a baby’s fist, wrapping them up in a piece of soft skin\r\nwhich he tied with a string. He made two or three of these bundles and\r\ntied them to the top of his bed, or to a post near by, where there was no\r\ndanger of their being disturbed.\r\n\r\nWe had no way of selecting tobacco seed. We just gathered any seed that\r\nwas borne on the plants. Of course there were always good and bad seeds\r\nin every package; but as the owner of a tobacco garden always planted his\r\nseed very thickly, he was able to weed out all the weak plants as they\r\ncame up, as I have already explained.\r\n\r\nA tobacco plant, pulled up and hung up in the lodge, we called o´puti:\r\nopi, tobacco, and uti, base, foundation, substantial part.\r\n\r\nThe Mandans and Arikaras raised tobacco exactly as we did, in little\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Selling to the Sioux_\r\n\r\nWe used to sell a good deal of tobacco to the Sioux. They called it\r\nPana´nitachani, or Ree’s tobacco.\r\n\r\nA bunch six or seven inches in diameter, bound together, we sold for one\r\ntanned hide.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Size of Tobacco Garden_\r\n\r\nMy father’s tobacco garden, when I was a little girl, was somewhat larger\r\nthan this room; and that, as you measure it, is twenty-one by eighteen\r\nfeet. I have seen other tobacco gardens planted by old men that measured\r\nsomewhat larger; but this was about the average size.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Customs_\r\n\r\nIf any one went into a tobacco garden and took tobacco without notifying\r\nthe owner, we said that his hair would fall out; and if any one in the\r\nvillage began to lose his hair, and it kept coming out when he brushed\r\nit, we would laugh and say, “Hey, hey, you man! You have been stealing\r\ntobacco!”\r\n\r\nWhat? You say you got this tobacco out of Wolf Chief’s garden without\r\nasking? (laughing heartily.) Then be sure your hair will fall out when\r\nyou comb it. Just watch, and see if it doesn’t!\r\n\r\nI have said that my father softened the soil of his tobacco garden with\r\na hoe. After the plants began to grow, the hoe was not used, either for\r\ncutting the weeds or for hilling up the plants. I have said that the weak\r\nplants were culled out by hand, and that the strong plants were hilled up\r\nwith a buffalo rib.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSORIES TO THE TOBACCO GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fence_\r\n\r\nWhen I was a little girl every tobacco garden had a willow fence around\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI remember very well seeing such fences built. Post holes were made\r\nby driving a sharp stake into the ground with an ax; the stake was\r\nwithdrawn, and into the hole left by it, a diamond willow was thrust for\r\na post; on this willow were left all the upper branches with the leaves.\r\nA rail was run from the post to its next neighbor, at the height of a\r\nwoman’s shoulder, and stayed in place by bending over the leafy top of\r\nthe willow post, and drawing it around the rail, then twisting it down\r\nand around the body at the post in a spiral manner. If the leafy top\r\nof the post was long enough, and slender enough, it might, after being\r\nwrapped spirally about the post, be even drawn out and woven into the\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nBelow the top rail at a convenient distance, there ran a second rail,\r\nbound to the post with bark. Besides these rails, branches and twigs, and\r\nas I have said, the tops of the posts themselves, were interwoven into\r\nthe fence to make it as dense as possible.\r\n\r\nThe posts of the fence stood about two and a half feet apart, making,\r\nwith the rails and the interwoven twigs, a barrier so dense that even a\r\ndog could not push through it.\r\n\r\nThere was an opening left to enter the garden, closed by a kind of\r\nstile—bars of small poles thrust right and left between the posts;\r\nagainst these bars were leaned one or two bull berry bushes, which were\r\nremoved when the owner wanted to enter.\r\n\r\nIf a weak place was found in the fence, it was strengthened with a bull\r\nberry bush thrust into the ground and leaned against the fence or woven\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scrotum Basket_\r\n\r\nI have said that we used a basket made of the scrotum of a buffalo bull,\r\nfor picking tobacco blossoms.\r\n\r\nA fresh scrotum was taken, and a rim or hoop of choke-cherry wood was\r\nbound around its mouth; choke-cherry limbs are flexible and easily bent.\r\nThe hoop was sewed in place with sinew passing through the skin and\r\naround the hoop spirally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 39\r\n\r\nReproduced from sketch by Goodbird.]\r\n\r\nA thong was bound at either end to opposite sides of the hoop, and the\r\nwhole was hung upon the drying stage, or at the entrance to the earth\r\nlodge in the sun. The skin was then filled with sand until dry, when it\r\nwas emptied, the thong removed, and a band, or leather handle, was bound\r\non one side of the hoop, at places a few inches apart, and the basket was\r\nready for use.\r\n\r\nThe scrotum is the toughest part of the buffalo’s hide. When dried it is\r\nas hard and rigid as wood.\r\n\r\nFigure 39 is a sketch by Goodbird showing what the basket was like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 40]\r\n\r\nDown in the bottoms along the Missouri near Independence school house\r\nare the gardens—now abandoned—used by the neighboring families when they\r\nfirst came to this part of the reservation, about 1886.\r\n\r\nThe fields are plainly marked in the underbrush and trees from the fact\r\nthat they are relatively open. Goodbird accompanied me to the several\r\nlocations and I made maps of the fields, which I include in figure 40.\r\nWhile not accurately surveyed—I had to pace off the distances—the fields\r\nare fairly accurately represented by the maps.\r\n\r\nFigure 40, _I_, is a diagram in vertical section of the land surface in\r\nwhich the gardens lie. Toward the right is seen the basin of the Missouri\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme left is a bit of the prairie that abuts the foothills.\r\nBetween are two level terraces, one eighty yards, the other and lower,\r\none hundred and seventy-five yards in width. Four of the gardens lie\r\nin the eighty-yard terrace; field _A_, of Small Ankle; _B_ of Big Foot\r\nBull; _E_ of Crow’s Breast, and _H_, a small bit of ground used by the\r\nSmall Ankle family for a squash garden. Gardens _C_ of Small Horn; _D_ of\r\nLeggings; _F_ of Crow’s Breast; and _G_ of Cedar Woman, lie in the lower\r\nand wider terrace.\r\n\r\nWith one exception the fields are called by the names of the male heads\r\nof the families, a custom that probably began at the time allotments were\r\nfirst made.\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of the fields are not as shown in the figure,\r\nexcept of _A_ and _B_, the gardens of Small Ankle and Big Foot Bull.\r\nThese are separated by a wagon road that descends to the lower terrace,\r\nas indicated on the map.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the two terraces have been made by over-flow waters. It is\r\nlikely that both are still subject to overflow at long intervals,\r\nespecially the lower. The soil is light and sandy, but black and rich.\r\nThe overflow of the river would seem to suggest that the land would be\r\nfertilized by silt deposited upon it; but my Indian informants seem to\r\nattach no significance to this. Fields were located near the Missouri\r\n“because the soil there is soft and easily worked, and does not become\r\ndry and burn up the crops.”\r\n\r\n                                                       GILBERT L.

Thus the corn grows and keeps on until it\r\nis ripe.\r\n\r\n“The sun may scorch the corn and try hard to dry it up, but the corn\r\ntakes care of itself, bringing the moistures that make the corn, and also\r\nthe beans, sunflowers, squashes, and tobacco grow.\r\n\r\n“The corn possesses all this magic power.\r\n\r\n“When you white people met our Mandan people we gave to the whites the\r\nname Maci´, or Waci´, meaning nice people, or pretty people. We called\r\nthem by this name because they had white faces and wore fine clothes. We\r\nsaid also ‘We will call these people our friends!’ And from that time to\r\nthis we have never made war on white men.\r\n\r\n“Our Mandan corn must now be all over the world, for we gave the white\r\nmen our seeds. And so it seems we Mandans have helped every people. But\r\nthe seed of our varieties of corn were originally ours.\r\n\r\n“We know that white men must also have had corn seed, for their corn is\r\ndifferent from ours. But all we older folk can tell our native corn from\r\nthat of white men.”—WOUNDED FACE (Mandan)\r\n\r\n[6] Corn sucker, i. e., the extra shoot or stem that often springs up\r\nfrom the base of the maize plant.\r\n\r\n[7] Buffalobird-woman says she planted six to eight kernels to a hill.\r\nJust what pattern she used she could not tell until she went out with a\r\nhandful of seed and planted a few hills to revive her memory. The three\r\npatterns shown in figure 7 will show how she laid the grains in the\r\nbottom of the several hills.—GILBERT L. WILSON\r\n\r\n[8] “Twice in the corn season were scarecrows used; first, when the corn\r\nwas just coming up; and again when the grain was forming on the ear and\r\ngetting ripe.”—EDWARD GOODBIRD\r\n\r\n[9] In August, 1910, Buffalobird-woman related the story of “The\r\nGrandson,” in the course of which she said in explanation of reference to\r\na watchers’ stage:\r\n\r\n“I will now stop a moment to explain something in the other form of this\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n“According to this way of telling it, there was a garden and in the\r\nmiddle of the garden was a tree. There was a platform under the tree made\r\nof trunks and slabs; and there those two girls sat to watch the garden\r\nand sing watch-garden songs. They did this to make the garden grow, just\r\nas people sing to a baby to make it be quiet and feel good. In old times\r\nwe sang to a garden for a like reason, to make the garden feel good and\r\ngrow. This custom was one used in every garden. Sometimes one or two\r\nwomen sang.\r\n\r\n“The singing was begun in the spring and continued until the corn was\r\nripe. We Indians loved our gardens and kept them clean; we did not let\r\nweeds grow in them. Always in every garden during the growing season,\r\nthere would be some one working or singing.\r\n\r\n“Now in old times, many of our gardens had resting stages, or watchers’\r\nstages, such as I have just described. We always made our gardens down\r\nin the woods by the river, because there is better ground there. When we\r\ncut off the timber we would often leave one tree standing in the garden.\r\nUnder this tree were erected four forked posts, on which was laid a\r\nplatform. This made the stage; in the tree overhead we often spread robes\r\nand blankets for shade.\r\n\r\n“This resting stage was small. It was just big enough for two persons to\r\nsit on comfortably. Corn was never dried on it; it was used for a singing\r\nand resting place only. It was reached by a ladder. Its height was about\r\nfour and a half feet high.\r\n\r\n“This resting stage or watchers’ stage was built on the north side of the\r\ntree so that the shade of the tree would fall upon it. Robes were laid\r\non the floor of the stage to make a couch or bed. Sometimes people even\r\nslept on this platform—sometimes a man and his wife slept there.\r\n\r\n“This resting stage we used to rest on after working in the garden; and\r\nto sing here the songs that we sang at this season of the year, and which\r\nI have called watch-garden songs. A place to cook in was not far away on\r\nthe edge of the garden. It was a kind of booth, or bower. With a stake we\r\nmade holes in the ground in a circle, and into the holes thrust willows.\r\nThe tops of these willows we bent toward the center and joined together\r\nto make a bower. Over the top we threw a robe. We built a fire beneath to\r\ncook by.\r\n\r\n“Our gardens I am describing were those at Like-a-fishhook village; and\r\nthey were on the Missouri on either side of the village. They were strung\r\nalong the river bank for a mile or more on either side of the village.”\r\n\r\n[10] In redrawing Goodbird’s sketch this calf-skin has been omitted, that\r\nthe construction of the stage floor might be shown.\r\n\r\n[11] “My wife is drying half-boiled corn on the ear this year. This way\r\nwe find makes the dried corn sweeter, but takes longer to dry it. We cook\r\nit in winter by dropping the ear, cob and all, into the pot. This method\r\nof drying corn was known also in old times.”—EDWARD GOODBIRD\r\n\r\n[12] Buffalobird-woman means that the buskers arrived in the fields in\r\nthe morning to begin the day’s labors. More than one corn pile might be\r\nhusked in a single day.—GILBERT L. WILSON\r\n\r\n[13] Water Chief having strolled into the cabin while Buffalobird-woman\r\nwas dictating, here interrupted with the following:\r\n\r\n“The owner of a field would come and notify the crier of some society, as\r\nthe Fox or Dog society, or some other. The crier would go on the roof of\r\nthe society’s lodge and call, ‘All you of the Fox society come hither;\r\nthey want you to husk. When you all get here, we will go to that one’s\r\ngarden and husk the corn!’\r\n\r\n“We young men of the society all gathered together and marched to the\r\nfield to which we were bidden. In old times we took our guns with us, for\r\nthe Sioux might come up to attack us. As we approached the field we began\r\nto sing, that the girls might hear us. We knew that our sweethearts would\r\ntake notice of our singing. The girls themselves did not sing.\r\n\r\n“At the corn pile in each garden would be the woman owner and maybe two\r\nor three girls. On our way to some field, if we passed through other\r\nfields with corn piles at which were girls, each young man looked to see\r\nif his sweetheart was there; and if he saw her he would yell, expecting\r\nthat she would recognise his voice.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes two societies husked at one corn pile. Any of the societies\r\nmight be asked. If the pile was too big for one society, another society\r\nwas asked, if the owner could afford the food for the feast.\r\n\r\n“Different societies would be husking in different gardens all at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes a group of young men belonging to different societies were\r\nasked to come and husk. This was chiefly at small gardens; the societies\r\nwere usually asked to come and husk the big corn piles of the larger\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n“If a society went early, they got through just after midday. By early I\r\nmean nine o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n“When we had finished husking one pile, we went to another. We worked\r\nlate, by moonlight, even.\r\n\r\n“Some man of the family and his wife would be out all night and watch\r\nby the corn if they had not gotten all the husked ears borne in to the\r\nvillage. Also while the pile awaited husking watchers stayed by to\r\nprotect against horses.”\r\n\r\n[14] “Corn in old times was gathered in September. A basket was carried\r\non the back and the corn was tossed into it over the shoulder, or the\r\nbasket was set on the ground and filled. This work was done by the women.\r\nThe corn having been plucked, the owner of the field notified people what\r\nfood she wanted to serve—meat or boiled corn-and-beans—and young men came\r\nto husk the corn. A pile might be three or four feet high and twenty feet\r\nlong. The men huskers sat on one side of the pile and the women on the\r\nother. The big ears were strung in braids. A braid was long enough to\r\nreach from the thigh around under the foot and up again to the other side\r\nof the thigh. A husker would try the newly made braid with his foot as\r\nhe held the ends in his hands. Unless this was done a weak place in the\r\nstring might escape notice and the braid break, and all the others would\r\nthen laugh.\r\n\r\n“Small ears were tossed into one place. Four or five women would carry\r\noff these ears in baskets; they bore the filled baskets right up the\r\nladder to the top of the drying stage. The braided strings were often\r\nborne home on the backs of ponies, ten strings on a pony. They were hung\r\nlike dead snakes on the railings above the floor of the stage to dry.\r\n\r\n“Boys and young men went to the husking bees because of the fun to be\r\nhad; they wanted to see the girls!”—EDWARD GOODBIRD (related in 1909).\r\n\r\n[15] “Sometimes for fun we lads used to take long poles with nooses on\r\nthe end and snare off one ear of a braid of corn as it hung drying; for\r\nthe braids were soft when fresh. An ear broken off, we would run off and\r\nmake a fire and parch the corn. This was when we were little fellows, ten\r\nor eleven years old. The owner would run after us, and if he caught one\r\nof us, whipped him. However, this was our custom; and the owner and the\r\nboy’s father both looked upon it as a kind of lark, and not anything very\r\nserious.”—EDWARD GOODBIRD\r\n\r\n[16] In 1910 Buffalobird-woman gave an interesting and detailed account\r\nof the making of a clay pot. A newly made pot, she explained, was rubbed\r\nover with boiled pounded-corn meal; and she added this rather humorous\r\nvariation of the recipe above:\r\n\r\n“This mush, or boiled, pounded-corn meal was made thus:\r\n\r\n“A clay pot was three-quarters filled with water and put on the fire to\r\nboil. Meanwhile, twelve double handfuls of corn were pounded in the corn\r\nmortar; usually we pounded three or four double handfuls at a time. This\r\nbegan after breakfast; it was work and made us women sweat. The corn was\r\nhard, ripe corn, yellow or white.\r\n\r\n“These twelve double handfuls were thrown into the pot of now boiling\r\nwater, and boiled for half an hour. As there was no grease in the pot, we\r\nhad to stir the contents with a smooth stick to keep from sticking.\r\n\r\n“As the corn boiled a scummy substance would rise to the top. To this\r\nthe woman cooking would touch the point of her horn spoon, and carry it\r\nto her tongue and lick it off. When she could taste that it was sticky\r\nenough, she knew that it was time to add beans. It took, as I have said,\r\nabout half an hour for the corn to boil to this point.\r\n\r\n“She now added some spring salt. This is alkaline salt which we gathered\r\nabout the mouth of springs. It was white. The woman put some of this salt\r\nin a cup and made a strong liquor—in old times instead of a cup she used\r\na horn spoon. She now added the salt liquor to the mess. It took about\r\nenough of this white salt to make a heaping tablespoonful to one pot of\r\nthis corn mess. As the salt liquor was poured into the pot, the woman\r\nheld her hand over the mouth of the cup, so that if any pieces of grass\r\nor other refuse were in it, they would be strained out by her fingers.\r\n\r\n“The corn when it is pounded does not pound evenly; and so when it was\r\nput into the pot, the finer part of the meal was cooked first. This rose\r\nto the top, and in old times was skimmed off. The coarser parts of the\r\nmeal took longer to cook; but the skimmed-off part, when the other was\r\ndone, was poured back into the pot again.\r\n\r\n“When the pounded corn meal had now all cooked and the salt had been\r\nadded, the beans were put in—red, spotted, black, or shield-figured,\r\nwe did not have white beans in very old times; they were brought in by\r\nwhite men. The pot was now let boil until the beans were done. Beans were\r\nalways added to the pot.\r\n\r\n“A pot of corn meal and beans was [almost] always on the fire in the\r\nlodge. The boys of the lodge liked to come around when the corn was\r\ncooking and dip horn spoons into the thick, rising liquor, and lick it\r\noff as I have described the woman doing as she cooked.\r\n\r\n“It was this sticky, rising liquor taken off the boiling corn to keep and\r\nreturn to it, that was used to rub over a newly made pot. When this was\r\ndone, the pot was ready to boil corn in.\r\n\r\n“After using a pot, it was usually rubbed over with the residue of the\r\nboiled corn meal, or mush, because this made the pot look better and last\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n“The skimmed-off liquor from a pot of boiling corn meal was also fed to\r\na baby whose mother had died, and whose family could not hire a woman to\r\nnurse it.”\r\n\r\n[17] Measuring from center of corn hill to center of next corn hill.—G.\r\nL. W.\r\n\r\n[18] “I have raised white beans mostly of late years because it is easier\r\nto sell them to white men. This summer, however (1913), I planted several\r\nacres also to other kinds of our Hidatsa beans, red, black, spotted.\r\n\r\n“I find that the black beans have yielded best, next the red, then the\r\nspotted, last of all the white. I have observed before that this is true;\r\nthat black beans yield the most.”—WOLF CHIEF\r\n\r\n[19] Slough grass, a species of Spartina.\r\n\r\n[20] Buffalobird-woman here means a three-section stage. A stage of four\r\nsections would be forty feet or more in length.—G. L. W.\r\n\r\n[21] “The first that rakes are mentioned in the stories of my tribe\r\nso far as I know, is in the tale of ‘The Grandson.’ There is a little\r\nlake down near Short River where lived an old magic woman, whom we call\r\nOld-woman-who-never-dies. There is a level piece of ground near by,\r\nabout five miles long by one and a half mile wide. This flat land was\r\nthe garden of Old-woman-who-never-dies. Her servants were the deer that\r\nthronged the near-by timber. These deer worked her garden for her. All\r\nbuck deer have horns; and with their horns the deer raked up the weeds\r\nand refuse of Old-woman-who-never-dies’s garden.\r\n\r\n“Now deer shed their horns. Old-woman-who-never-dies got these shed horns\r\nand bound them on sticks and so we got our first rakes. Her grandson saw\r\nwhat she did and afterwards taught the people to make rakes also.\r\n\r\n“In later times we learned to make rakes of ash wood instead of horns;\r\nbut we still reckon the teeth to mean the tines of a deer’s antler.\r\nSometimes deer have six, sometimes seven tines on an antler. So we make\r\nour ash rakes, some with six, some with seven teeth.\r\n\r\n“If the Grandson had not seen what his grandmother did, we Hidatsas would\r\nnever have known how to make rakes, either of horn or of ash wood.”—WOLF\r\nCHIEF (told in 1910).\r\n\r\n[22] “In my tribe in old times, some men helped their wives in their\r\ngardens. Others did not. Those who did not help their wives talked\r\nagainst those who did, saying, ‘That man’s wife makes him her servant!’\r\n\r\n“And the others retorted, ‘Look, that man puts all the hard work on his\r\nwife!’\r\n\r\n“Men were not alike; some did not like to work in the garden at all, and\r\ncared for nothing but to go around visiting or to be off on a hunt.\r\n\r\n“My father, Small Ankle, liked to garden and often helped his wives. He\r\ntold me that that was the best way to do. ‘Whatever you do,’ he said,\r\n‘help your wife in all things!’ He taught me to clean the garden, to help\r\ngather the corn, to hoe, and to rake.\r\n\r\n“My father said that that man lived best and had plenty to eat who helped\r\nhis wife. One who did not help his wife was likely to have scanty stores\r\nof food.”—WOLF CHIEF (told in 1910).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES\r\n\r\n1.
