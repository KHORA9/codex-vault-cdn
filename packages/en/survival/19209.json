The expedition was made under the auspices\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution, and consisted of the following gentlemen\r\nbesides the writer: Colonel Staunton, of Ingham University, Leroy, N.Y.;\r\nF.S. Williams, Esq., of Albany, N.Y.; and Messrs. P.V. Myers and A.\r\nBushnell, of Williams College. We sailed from New York July 1, 1867;\r\nand, after crossing the Isthmus of Panama and touching at Paita, Peru,\r\nour general route was from Guayaquil to Quito, over the Eastern\r\nCordillera; thence over the Western Cordillera, and through the forest\r\non foot to Napo; down the Rio Napo by canoe to Pebas, on the Marañon;\r\nand thence by steamer to Pará.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Another division, consisting of Messrs. H.M. Myers, R.H.\r\nForbes, and W. Gilbert, of Williams College, proceeded to Venezuela, and\r\nafter exploring the vicinity of Lake Valencia, the two former traversed\r\nthe Ilanos to Pao, descended the Apuré and ascended the Orinoco to\r\nYavita, crossed the portage of Pimichin (a low, level tract, nine miles\r\nwide, separating the waters of the Orinoco from those of the Amazon),\r\nand descended the Negro to Manáos, making a voyage by canoe of over 2000\r\nmiles through a little-known but deeply-interesting region. A narrative\r\nof this expedition will soon be given to the public.]\r\n\r\nNearly the entire region traversed by the expedition is strangely\r\nmisrepresented by the most recent geographical works. On the Andes of\r\nEcuador we have little besides the travels of Humboldt; on the Napo,\r\nnothing; while the Marañon is less known to North Americans than the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nMany of the following pages first appeared in the New York _Evening\r\nPost_. The author has also published \"Physical Observations on the Andes\r\nand the Amazon\" and \"Geological Notes on the Ecuadorian Andes\" in the\r\n_American Journal of Science_, an article on the great earthquake of\r\n1868 in the Rochester _Democrat_, and a paper _On the Valley of the\r\nAmazon_ read before the American Association at Salem. These papers have\r\nbeen revised and extended, though the popular form has been retained. It\r\nhas been the effort of the writer to present a condensed but faithful\r\npicture of the physical aspect, the resources, and the inhabitants of\r\nthis vast country, which is destined to become an important field for\r\ncommercial enterprise. For detailed descriptions of the collections in\r\nnatural history, the scientific reader is referred to the various\r\nreports of the following gentlemen, to whom the specimens were committed\r\nby the Smithsonian Institution:\r\n\r\nVolcanic Rocks                  Dr. T.

Most of the illustrations are after\r\nphotographs or drawings made on the ground, and can be relied upon. The\r\nportrait of Humboldt, which is for the first time presented to the\r\npublic, was photographed from the original painting in the possession of\r\nSr. Aguirre, Quito. Unlike the usual portrait--an old man, in\r\nBerlin--this presents him as a young man in Prussian uniform, traveling\r\non the Andes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: We have retained the common orthography of this word,\r\nthough _Amazons_, used by Bates, is doubtless more correct, as more akin\r\nto the Brazilian name _Amazonas_.]\r\n\r\nWe desire to express our grateful acknowledgments to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, Hon.

J.C. FLETCHER,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"BRAZIL AND BRAZILIANS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this day of many voyages, in the Old World and the New, it is\r\nrefreshing to find an untrodden path. Central Africa has been more fully\r\nexplored than that region of Equatorial America which lies in the midst\r\nof the Western Andes and upon the slopes of these mountain monarchs\r\nwhich look toward the Atlantic. In this century one can almost count\r\nupon his hand the travelers who have written of their journeys in this\r\nunknown region. Our own Herndon and Gibbon descended--the one the\r\nPeruvian and the other the Bolivian waters--the affluents of the Amazon,\r\nbeginning their voyage where the streams were mere channels for canoes,\r\nand finishing it where the great river appears a fresh-water ocean. Mr.\r\nChurch, the artist, made the sketches for his famous \"Heart of the\r\nAndes\" where the headwaters of the Amazon are rivulets. But no one whose\r\nlanguage is the English has journeyed down and described the voyage from\r\nthe _plateaux_ of Ecuador to the Atlantic Ocean until Professor Orton\r\nand his party accomplished this feat in 1868. Yet it was over this very\r\nroute that the King of Waters (as the Amazon is called by the\r\naborigines) was originally discovered. The _auri sacra fames_, which in\r\n1541 urged the adventurous Gonzalo Pizarro to hunt for the fabled city\r\nof _El Dorado_ in the depths of the South American forests, led to the\r\ndescent of the great river by Orellana, a knight of Truxillo. The fabled\r\nwomen-warriors were said to have been seen in this notable voyage, and\r\nhence the name of the river _Amazon_, a name which in Spanish and\r\nPortuguese is in the plural. It was not until nearly one hundred years\r\nafter Orellana was in his grave that a voyage of discovery ascended the\r\nriver. In 1637 Pedro Teixeira started from Pará with an expedition of\r\nnearly two thousand (all but seventy of whom were natives), and with\r\nvaried experiences, by water and by land, the explorer in eight months\r\nreached the city of Quito, where he was received with distinguished\r\nhonor. Two hundred years ago the result of this expedition was\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon was from that time, at rare intervals, the highway of Spanish\r\nand Portuguese priests and friars, who thus went to their distant\r\ncharges among the Indians. In 1745 the French academician De la\r\nCondamine descended from Quito to Pará, and gave the most accurate idea\r\nof the great valley which we had until the first quarter of this\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe narrow policy of Spain and Portugal was most unfruitful in its\r\nresults to South America. A jealous eye guarded that great region, of\r\nwhich it can be so well said there are\r\n\r\n                \"Realms unknown and blooming wilds,\r\n    And fruitful deserts, worlds of solitude,\r\n    Where the sun smiles and seasons teem in vain.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the making known to the world of any portion of these \"fruitful\r\ndeserts\" is performing a service for the world. This Professor Orton\r\nhas done. His interesting and valuable volume hardly needs any\r\nintroduction or commendation, for its intrinsic merit will exact the\r\napprobation of every reader. Scientific men, and tourists who seek for\r\nnew routes of travel, will appreciate it at once; and I trust that the\r\ntime is near at hand when our mercantile men, by the perusal of such a\r\nwork, will see how wide a field lies before them for future commercial\r\nenterprise. This portion of the tropics abounds in natural resources\r\nwhich only need the stimulus of capital to draw them forth to the light;\r\nto create among the natives a desire for articles of civilization in\r\nexchange for the crude productions of the forest; and to stimulate\r\nemigration to a healthy region of perpetual summer.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if Providence were opening the way for a great change in the\r\nValley of the Amazon. That immense region drained by the great river is\r\nas large as all the United States east of the States of California and\r\nOregon and the Territory of Washington, and yet it has been so secluded,\r\nmainly by the old monopolistic policy of Portugal, that that vast space\r\nhas not a population equal to the single city of Rio de Janeiro or of\r\nBrooklyn. Two million five hundred thousand square miles are drained by\r\nthe Amazon. Three fourths of Brazil, one half of Bolivia, two thirds of\r\nPeru, three fourths of Ecuador, and a portion of Venezuela are watered\r\nby this river. Riches, mineral and vegetable, of inexhaustible supply\r\nhave been here locked up for centuries. Brazil held the key, but it was\r\nnot until under the rule of their present constitutional monarch, Don\r\nPedro II., that the Brazilians awoke to the necessity of opening this\r\nglorious region. Steamers were introduced in 1853, subsidized by the\r\ngovernment. But it is to a young Brazilian statesman, Sr. A.C. Tavares\r\nBastos, that belongs the credit of having agitated, in the press and in\r\nthe national parliament, the opening of the Amazon, until public\r\nopinion, thus acted upon, produced the desired result. On another\r\noccasion, in May, 1868, I gave several indices of a more enlightened\r\npolicy in Brazil, and stated that the opening of the Amazon, which\r\noccurred on the 7th of September, 1867, and by which the great river is\r\nfree to the flags of all nations, from the Atlantic to Peru, and the\r\nabrogation of the monopoly of the coast-trade from the Amazon to the Rio\r\nGrande do Sul, whereby 4000 miles of Brazilian sea-coast are open to the\r\nvessels of every country, can not fail not only to develop the resources\r\nof Brazil, but will prove of great benefit to the bordering\r\nHispano-American republics and to the maritime nations of the earth. The\r\nopening of the Amazon is the most significant indication that the leaven\r\nof the narrow monopolistic Portuguese conservatism has at last worked\r\nout. Portugal would not allow Humboldt to enter the Amazon Valley in\r\nBrazil. The result of the new policy is beyond the most sanguine\r\nexpectation. The exports and imports for Pará for October and November,\r\n1867, were double those of 1866. This is but the beginning. Soon it will\r\nbe found that it is cheaper for Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and New Granada,\r\neast of the Andes, to receive their goods from, and to export their\r\nIndia-rubber, cinchona, etc., to the United States and Europe, _via_ the\r\ngreat water highway which discharges into the Atlantic, than by the\r\nlong, circuitous route of Cape Horn or the trans-Isthmian route of\r\nPanama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGuayaquil.--First and Last Impressions.--Climate.--Commerce.--The\r\nMalecon.--Glimpse of the Andes.--Scenes on the Guayas.--Bodegas.--Mounted\r\nfor Quito.--La Mena.--A Tropical Forest......Page 25\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOur Tambo.--Ascending the Andes.--Camino Real.--Magnificent Views.\r\n--Guaranda.--Cinchona.--The\r\nSummit.--Chimborazo.--Over the Andes.--Chuquipoyo\r\nthe Wretched.--Ambato.--A Stupid City.--Cotopaxi.--The\r\nVale of Machachi.--Arrival at Quito......40\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEarly History of Quito.--Its Splendor under the Incas.--Crushed by Spain.\r\n--Dying now.--Situation.--Altitude.--Streets.--Buildings......56\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPopulation of Quito.--Dress.--Manners.--Character.--Commerce.--Agriculture.\r\n--Manufactures.--Arts.--Education.--Amusements.--Quito\r\nLadies......68\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEcuador.--Extent.--Government.--Religion.--A Protestant Cemetery in\r\nQuito.--Climate.--Regularity of Tropical Nature.\r\n--Diseases on the Highlands......85\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAstronomic Virtues of Quito.--Flora and Fauna of the Valley of Quito.\r\n--Primeval Inhabitants of the Andes.--Quichua Indians......97\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGeological History of South America.--Rise of the Andes.--Creation of the\r\nAmazon.--Characteristic Features of the Continent.--Andean Chain.--The\r\nEquatorial Volcanoes......114\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Volcanoes of Ecuador.--Western Cordillera.--Chimborazo.--Iliniza.\r\n--Corazon.--Pichincha.--Descent into its Crater.

The first view\r\nawakened visions of Oriental splendor. Before us was the Malecon,\r\nstretching along the river, two miles in length--at once the most\r\nbeautiful and the most busy street in the emporium of Ecuador. In the\r\ncentre rose the Government House, with its quaint old tower, bearing\r\naloft the city clock. On either hand were long rows of massive,\r\napparently marble, three-storied buildings, each occupying an entire\r\nsquare, and as elegant as they were massive. Each story was blessed with\r\na balcony, the upper one hung with canvas curtains now rolled up, the\r\nother protruding over the sidewalk to form a lengthened arcade like that\r\nof the Rue de Rivoli in imperial Paris. In this lower story were the gay\r\nshops of Guayaquil, filled with the prints, and silks, and fancy\r\narticles of England and France. As this is the promenade street as well\r\nas the Broadway of commerce, crowds of Ecuadorians, who never do\r\nbusiness in the evening, leisurely paced the magnificent arcade; hatless\r\nladies sparkling with fire-flies[4] instead of diamonds, and far more\r\nbrilliant than koh-i-noors, swept the pavement with their long trains;\r\nmartial music floated on the gentle breeze from the barracks or some\r\nfestive hall, and a thousand gas-lights along the levee and in the city,\r\ndoubling their number by reflection from the river, betokened wealth and\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The _Pyrophorus noctilucus_, or \"cucujo,\" found also in\r\nMexico and the West Indies. It resembles our large spring-beetle. The\r\nlight proceeds from two eye-like spots on the thorax and from the\r\nsegments underneath. It feeds on the sugar-cane. On the Upper Amazon we\r\nfound the _P. clarus_, _P. pellucens_, and _P. tuberculatus_.\r\nAt Bahia, on the opposite coast, Darwin found _P. luminosus_, the most common\r\nluminous insect.]\r\n\r\nWe landed in the morning to find our vision a dissolving view in the\r\nlight of the rising sun. The princely mansions turned out to be hollow\r\nsquares of wood-work, plastered within and without, and roofed with red\r\ntiles. Even the \"squares\" were only distant approximations; not a right\r\nangle could we find in our hotel. All the edifices are built (very\r\nproperly in this climate) to admit air instead of excluding it, and the\r\narchitects have wonderfully succeeded; but with the air is wafted many\r\nan odor not so pleasing as the spicy breezes from Ceylon's isle. The\r\ncathedral is of elegant design. Its photograph is more imposing than\r\nNotre Dame, and a Latin inscription tells us that it is the Gate of\r\nHeaven. But a near approach reveals a shabby structure, and the pewless\r\ninterior is made hideous by paintings and images which certainly must be\r\ncaricatures. A few genuine works of art imported from Italy alone\r\nrelieve the mind of the visitor. Excepting a few houses on the Malecon,\r\nand not excepting the cathedral, the majority of the buildings have a\r\ntumble-down appearance, which is not altogether due to the frequent\r\nearthquakes which have troubled this city; while the habitations in the\r\noutskirts are exceedingly primitive, floored and walled with split cane\r\nand thatched with leaves, the first story occupied by domestic animals\r\nand the second by their owners. The city is quite regularly laid out,\r\nthe main streets running parallel to the river. A few streets are\r\nrudely paved, many are shockingly filthy, and all of them yield grass to\r\nthe delight of stray donkeys and goats. A number of mule-carts, half a\r\ndozen carriages, one omnibus, and a hand-car on the Malecon, sum up the\r\nwheeled vehicles of Guayaquil. The population is twenty-two thousand,\r\nthe same for thirty years past. Of these, about twenty are from the\r\nUnited States, and perhaps twenty-five can command $100,000. No\r\nforeigner has had reason to complain that Guayaquilians lacked the\r\nvirtues of politeness and hospitality. The ladies dress in excellent\r\ntaste, and are proverbial for their beauty. Spanish, Indian, and Negro\r\nblood mingle in the lower classes. The city supports two small papers,\r\n_Los Andes_ and _La Patria_, but they are usually issued about ten days\r\nbehind date. The hourly cry of the night-watchman is quite as musical as\r\nthat of the muezzin in Constantinople. At eleven o'clock, for example,\r\nthey sing \"_Ave Maria purissima! los once han dedo, noche clara y\r\nserena. Viva la Patria!_\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cathedral of Guayaquil.]\r\n\r\nThe full name of the city is Santiago de Guayaquil.[5] It is so called,\r\nfirst, because the conquest of the province was finished on the 25th of\r\nJuly (the day of St. James), 1533; and, secondly, after Guayas, a\r\nfeudatory cacique of Atahuallpa. It was created a city by Charles V.,\r\nOctober 6, 1535. It has suffered much in its subsequent history by fires\r\nand earthquakes, pirates and pestilence. It is situated on the right\r\nbank of the River Guayas, sixty miles from the ocean, and but a few feet\r\nabove its level. Though the most western city in South America, it is\r\nonly two degrees west of the longitude of Washington, and it is the same\r\ndistance below the equator--Orion sailing directly overhead, and the\r\nSouthern Cross taking the place of the Great Dipper. The mean annual\r\ntemperature, according to our observations, is 83°. There are two\r\nseasons, the wet, or _invierno_, and the dry, or _verano_. The _verano_\r\nis called the summer, although astronomically it is winter; it begins in\r\nJune and terminates in November.[6] The heavy rains come on about\r\nChristmas. March is the rainiest month in the year, and July the\r\ncoldest. It is at the close of the _invierno_ (May) that fevers most\r\nabound. The climate of Guayaquil during the dry season is nearly\r\nperfect. At daybreak there is a cool easterly breeze; at sunrise a brief\r\nlull, and then a gentle variable wind; at 3 P.M. a southwest wind, at\r\nfirst in gusts, then in a sustained current; at sunset the same softened\r\ndown to a gentle breeze, increasing about _7_ P.M., and dying away about\r\n3 A.M. Notwithstanding heaps of filth and green-mantled pools,\r\nsufficient to start a pestilence if transported to New York, the city\r\nis usually healthy, due in great part, no doubt, to countless flocks of\r\nbuzzards which greedily wait upon decay. These carrion-hawks enjoy the\r\nprotection of law, a heavy fine being imposed for wantonly killing\r\none.[7] It is during the rainy season that this port earns the\r\nreputation of being one of the most pestiferous spots on the globe. The\r\nair is then hot and oppressive, reminding the geologist of the steaming\r\natmosphere in the carboniferous period; the surrounding plains are\r\nflooded with water, and the roads, even some of the streets of the city,\r\nbecome impassable; intolerable musquitoes, huge cockroaches, disgusting\r\ncentipedes, venomous scorpions, and still more deadly serpents, keep the\r\nhuman species circumspect, and fevers and dysenteries do the work of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The ancient name was _Culenta_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The continuity of the dry season is broken by a rainy fit\r\ncommencing a few days after the autumnal equinox, and called _el\r\nCordonazo de San Francisco_. \"Throughout South America (observes Mr.\r\nSpruce) the periodical alternations of dry and rainy weather are laid to\r\nthe account of those saints whose 'days' coincide nearly with the epochs\r\nof change. But if the weather be rainy when it ought to be fair, or if\r\nthe rains of winter be heavier than ordinary, the blame is invariably\r\nlaid on the moon.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The turkey-buzzard, the \"John Crow\" of the West Indies, is\r\nnot a social bird, though a score are often seen together: each comes\r\nand goes by himself.]\r\n\r\nThe Guayas is the largest river on the Pacific coast; and Guayaquil\r\nmonopolizes the commerce of Ecuador, for it is the only port. Esmeraldas\r\nand Peylon are not to be mentioned. Through its custom-house passes\r\nnearly every import and export. The green banks of the Guayas, covered\r\nwith an exuberant growth, are in strong contrast with the sterile coast\r\nof Peru, and the possession of Guayaquil has been a coveted prize since\r\nthe days of Pizarro. Few spots between the tropics can vie with this\r\nlowland in richness and vigor of vegetation. Immense quantities of\r\ncacao--second only to that of Caracas--are produced, though but a\r\nfraction is gathered, owing to the scarcity of laborers, so many\r\nEcuadorians have been exiled or killed in senseless revolutions. Twenty\r\nmillion pounds are annually exported, chiefly to Spain; and two million\r\npounds of excellent coffee, which often finds its way into New York\r\nunder the name of \"pure Java.\" There are three or four kinds of\r\nindigenous cacao on this coast, all richly deserving the generic title\r\n_Theobroma_, or \"food for the gods.\" The best grows in Esmeraldas, as it\r\ncontains the largest amount of oil and has the most pleasant flavor. But\r\nvery little of it is exported, because it rots in about six months. The\r\n_cacao de arriba_, from up the River Guayas, is the best to export, as\r\nit keeps two years without damage. Next in order is the _cacao de\r\nabajo_, from down the river, as Machala, Santa Rosa, Balao, and Manabi,\r\nbelow Guayaquil. A still richer nut is the mountain cacao, but it is\r\nnever cultivated. It is small and white, and almost pure oil. This oil,\r\ncalled cacao-butter, is used by the natives for burns, sores, and many\r\ncutaneous diseases. Cacao contributes more to the commerce of the\r\nrepublic than any other production of its soil. The flowers and fruit\r\ngrow directly out of the trunk and branches. \"A more striking example\r\n(says Humboldt) of the expansive powers of life could hardly be met with\r\nin organic nature.\" The fruit is yellowish-red, and of oblong shape, and\r\nthe seeds (from which chocolate is prepared) are enveloped in a mass of\r\nwhite pulp. The tree resembles our lilac in size and shape, and yields\r\nthree crops a year--in March, June, and September. Spain is the largest\r\nconsumer of cacao. The Mexican _chocolalt_ is the origin of our word\r\nchocolate. Tucker gives the following comparative analysis of unshelled\r\nbeans from Guayaquil and Caracas:\r\n\r\n                     Guayaquil.

The leaf,\r\nwhich is a yard long, is plaited like a fan, and is borne on a\r\nthree-cornered stalk. It is cut while young, the stiff parallel veins\r\nremoved, then slit into shreds by whipping it, and immersed in boiling\r\nwater, and finally bleached in the sun. The same \"straw\" is used in the\r\ninterior. The \"Mocora,\" which grows like a cocoa-nut tree, with a very\r\nsmooth, hard, thorny bark, is rarely used, as it is difficult to work.\r\nThe leaves are from eight to twelve feet in length, so that the \"straws\"\r\nwill finish a hat without splicing. Such hats require two or three\r\nmonths, and bring sometimes $150; but they will last a lifetime. They\r\ncan be packed away in a vest pocket, and they can be turned inside out\r\nand worn, the inside surface being as smooth and well finished as the\r\noutside. \"Toquilla\" hats are whiter than the \"mocora.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: In 1867 there were exported to Europe of cacao, 197,260\r\nquintals; cotton, 10,247 do.; caucho, 8911 do.; sarsaparilla, 149 do.;\r\norchilla, 10,247 packages; quinine, 5000 do.; tobacco, 2000 do.; coffee,\r\n1611 do.; tamarinds, 65 bbls.; sides of leather, 22,514; hats, 8397.]\r\n\r\nThe exports from Guayaquil bear no proportion to the capabilities of the\r\ncountry; Ecuador has no excuse for being bankrupt. Most of the imports\r\nare of English origin; lard comes from the United States, and flour from\r\nChile.\r\n\r\nThe Malecon and river present a lively scene all the year round; the\r\nrest of the city appears deserted in comparison. The British steamers\r\nfrom Panama and Payta arrive weekly; Yankee steam-boats make regular\r\ntrips up and down the Guayas and its tributaries; half a dozen sailing\r\nvessels, principally French, are usually lying in the stream, which is\r\nhere six fathoms deep; and hundreds of canoes are gliding to and fro.\r\nBut the _balsas_ are the most original, and, therefore, the most\r\nattractive sight. These are rafts made of light balsa wood, so buoyant\r\nas to be used in coasting voyages. They were invented by the old\r\nPeruvians, and are the homes of a literally floating population. By\r\nthese and the smaller craft are brought to the mole of the Malecon,\r\nbesides articles for exportation, a boundless variety of\r\nfruits--pine-apples (whose quality has made Guayaquil famous), oranges,\r\nlemons, limes, plantains, bananas, cocoa-nuts, alligator pears, papayas,\r\nmangos, guavas, melons, etc.; many an undescribed species of fish known\r\nonly to the epicure, and barrels or jars of water from a distant point\r\nup the river, out of the reach of the tide and the city sewers. Ice is\r\nfrequently brought from Chimborazo, and sold for $1 per pound. A flag\r\nhoisted at a favorite café announces that snow has arrived from the\r\nmountains, and that ice-cream can be had. The market, held every morning\r\nby the river side, is an animated scene. The strife of the half-naked\r\nfishmongers, the cry of the swarthy fruit-dealers--\"Pinas!\" \"Naranjas!\"\r\netc., and the song of the itinerant dulce-peddler--\"Tamales!\" mingled\r\nwith the bray of the water-bearing donkeys as they trot through the\r\ntown, never fail to arrest the attention of every traveler.\r\n\r\nBut there is another sight more attractive still--one worth a long\r\nvoyage, for Nature nowhere else repeats the picture. From the balconies\r\nof Guayaquil can be seen on a clear day the long, towering range of the\r\nAndes. We may forget all the incidents in our subsequent journey, but\r\nthe impression produced by that glorious view is unfading. The sun had\r\nnearly touched the Pacific when the clouds, which for days had wrapped\r\nthe Cordilleras[9] in misty robes, suddenly rose like a curtain. There\r\nstood, in inconceivable grandeur, one of the stupendous products of the\r\nlast great revolution of the earth's crust, as a geologist would say,\r\nbut, in the language of history, the lofty home of the Incas, made\r\nillustrious by the sword of Pizarro and the pen of Prescott. On the\r\nright a sea of hills rose higher and higher, till they culminated in the\r\npurple mountains of Assuay. Far to the left, one hundred miles\r\nnortheasterly, the peerless Chimborazo lifted its untrodden and\r\nunapproachable summit above its fellows--an imposing background to\r\nlesser mountains and stately forests. The great dome reflected\r\ndazzlingly the last blushes of the west, its crown of snow fringed with\r\nblack lines, which were the steep and sharp edges of precipitous rocks.\r\nIt was interesting to watch the mellowing tints on the summit as the\r\nshadows crept upward: gold, vermilion, violet, purple, were followed by\r\na momentary \"glory;\" then darkness covered the earth, and a host of\r\nstars, \"trembling with excess of light,\" burst suddenly into view over\r\nthe peaks of the Andes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Cordillera_ (pronounced Cor-de-yér-ra), literally a long\r\nridge, is usually applied to a longitudinal subdivision of the Andes, as\r\nthe east and west cordilleras inclosing the valley of Quito; _Sierra_\r\n(from the Spanish for saw or Arabic _sehrah_, an uncultivated tract) is\r\na jagged spur of the Andes; _Cerro_, \"a hog-backed hill.\" _Paramo_ (a\r\ndesert) is the treeless, uninhabited, uncultivated rolling steppes just\r\nbelow the snow-limit.]\r\n\r\nBidding \"adios\" to our Guayaquilian friends, we took passage in one of\r\nCaptain Lee's little steamers to Bodegas, seventy miles up the river.\r\nThe Ecuadorian government, strange to say, does not patronize these\r\nsteamers, but carries the Quito mail in a canoe. The Guayas is a\r\nsluggish stream, its turbid waters starting from the slope of the\r\nAndes, and flowing through a low, level tract, covered with varied forms\r\nof vegetable life. Forests of the broad-leaved plantain and banana line\r\nthe banks. The fruit is the most common article of food in equatorial\r\nAmerica, and is eaten raw, roasted, baked, boiled, and fried. It grows\r\non a succulent stem formed of sheath-like leaf-stalks rolled over one\r\nanother, and terminating in enormous light green, glossy blades nearly\r\nten feet long by two feet wide, so delicate that the slightest wind will\r\ntear them transversely. Each tree (vulgarly called \"the tree of\r\nparadise\") produces fruit but once, and then dies. A single bunch often\r\nweighs 60 or 70 pounds; and Humboldt calculated that 33 pounds of wheat\r\nand 99 pounds of potatoes require the same space of ground as will\r\nproduce 4000 pounds of bananas. They really save more labor than steam,\r\ngiving the greatest amount of food from a given piece of ground with the\r\nleast labor. They are always found where the palm is; but their original\r\nhome is the foot of the Himalayas. The banana (by some botanists\r\nconsidered a different species from the plantain) is about four inches\r\nlong, and cylindrical, and is eaten raw. The plantain is twice as large\r\nand prismatic, and uncooked is unhealthy. There is another variety,\r\n_platanos de Otaheite_, which resembles the banana in size and quality,\r\nbut is prismatic.\r\n\r\nA belt of jungle and impenetrable brushwood intervenes, and then cacao\r\nand coffee plantations, vast in extent, arrest the eye. Passing these,\r\nthe steamer brings you alongside of broad fields covered with the low,\r\nprickly pine-apple plant; the air is fragrant with a rich perfume wafted\r\nfrom a neighboring grove of oranges and lemons; the mango spreads its\r\ndense, splendid foliage, and bears a golden fruit, which, though praised\r\nby many, tastes to us like a mixture of tow and turpentine; the exotic\r\nbread-tree waves its fig-like leaves and pendent fruit; while high over\r\nall the beautiful cocoa-palm lifts its crown of glory.[10] Animal life\r\ndoes not compare with this luxuriant growth. The steamer-bound traveler\r\nmay see a few monkeys, a group of _gallinazos_, and many brilliant,\r\nthough songless birds; but the chief representative is the lazy, ugly\r\nalligator. Large numbers of these monsters may be seen on the mud-bank\r\nbasking in the hot sun, or asleep with their mouths wide open.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The mango of Asia is superior in size and flavor to that\r\nof America. It is eaten largely in Brazil by negroes and cattle. The\r\ncocoa-palm is also of Asiatic origin, and is most abundant in Ceylon. It\r\nhas a swollen stem when young, but becomes straight and tall when\r\nmature. The flowers burst into a long plume of soft, cream-colored\r\nblossoms. It is worthy of remembrance that the most beautiful forms of\r\nvegetation in the tropics are at the same time most useful to man.]\r\n\r\nEight hours after leaving the Malecon we arrived at Bodegas, a little\r\nvillage of two thousand souls, rejoicing in the synonym of Babahoyo.\r\nThis has been a place of deposit for the interior from the earliest\r\ntimes. In the rainy season the whole site is flooded, and only the upper\r\nstories are habitable. Cock-fighting seems to be the chief amusement. We\r\nbreakfasted with the governor, a portly gentleman who kept a little\r\ndry-goods store. His excellency, without waiting for a formal\r\nintroduction, and with a cordiality and courtesy almost confined to the\r\nLatin nations, received us into his own house, and honored us with a\r\nseat at his private table, spread with the choicest viands of his\r\nkingdom, serving them himself with a grace to which we can not do\r\njustice. Much as we find to condemn in tropical society, we can not\r\nforget the kindness of these simple-hearted people. Though we may\r\nportray, in the coming pages, many faults and failings according to a\r\nNew York standard, we wish it to be understood that there is another\r\nside to the picture; that there are virtues on the Andes to which the\r\nNorth is well-nigh a stranger. \"How many times (says an American\r\nresident of ten years) I have arrived at a miserable hut in the heart\r\nof the mountains, tired and hungry, after traveling all day without any\r\nother companion than the arriero, to receive a warm-hearted welcome, the\r\nbest, perhaps the only chair or hammock offered to me, the fattest\r\nchicken in the yard killed on my account, and more than once they have\r\ncompelled me by force to take the only good bed, because I must be\r\ntired, and should have a good night's rest. A man may travel from one\r\nend of the Andes to the other, depending altogether on the good people\r\nhe meets.\"\r\n\r\nAt Bodegas travelers take to mules or horses for the mountains, hiring\r\none set for Guaranda and another at that village for Quito; muleteers\r\nseldom allow their animals to pass from one altitude to the other. These\r\n_arrieros_, or muleteers, form a very important class in Ecuador. Their\r\nlittle caravans are the only baggage and express trains in the republic;\r\nthere is not a single regularly established public conveyance in the\r\nland. The _arrieros_ and their servants (_peons_) are Indians or\r\nhalf-breeds. They wear a straw or felt hat, a poncho striped like an\r\nArab's blanket, and cotton breeches ending at the knees. For food they\r\ncarry a bag of parched corn, another bag of roasted barley-meal\r\n(_mashka_), and a few red peppers. The beasts are thin, decrepit jades,\r\nwhich threaten to give out the first day; yet they must carry you\r\nhalfway up the Andes. The distance to the capital is nearly two hundred\r\nmiles. The time required is usually eight or nine days; but officials\r\noften travel it in four.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Equipped for the Andes.]\r\n\r\nWe left Bodegas at noon. It was impossible to start the muleteer a\r\nmoment earlier, though he had promised to be ready at seven. Patience is\r\na necessary qualification in a South American traveler. In our company\r\nwere a Jesuit priest, with three attendants, going to Riobamba, and a\r\nyoung Quito merchant, with his mother--the mother of only twenty-five\r\nchildren. This merchant had traveled in the United States, and could not\r\nhelp contrasting the thrift and enterprise of our country with the\r\nbeggary and laziness of his own, adding, with a show of sincerity, \"I am\r\nsorry I have Spanish blood in my veins.\" The suburbs of Bodegas reminded\r\nus of the outskirts of Cairo; but the road soon entered a broad savannah\r\ninstead of a sandy desert. At 3 P.M. we passed through La Mona, a\r\nvillage of twenty-five bamboo huts, all on stilts, for in the rainy\r\nseason the whole town is under water. Signs of indolence and neglect\r\nwere every where visible. Idle men, with an uncertain mixture of\r\nEuropean, Negro, and Indian blood; sad-looking Quichua women, carrying a\r\nnaked infant or a red water-jar on the back; black hogs and lean poultry\r\nwandering at will into the houses--such is the picture of the motley\r\nlife in the inland villages. Strange was the contrast between human\r\npoverty and natural wealth. We were on the borders of a virgin forest,\r\nand the overpowering beauty of the vegetation soon erased all memory of\r\nthe squalor and lifelessness of La Mona. Our road--a mere path, suddenly\r\nentered this seemingly impenetrable forest, where the branches crossed\r\noverhead, producing a delightful shade. The curious forms of tropical\r\nlife were all attractive to one who had recently rambled over the\r\ncomparatively bleak hills of New England. Delight is a weak term to\r\nexpress the feelings of a naturalist who for the first time wanders in a\r\nSouth American forest. The superb banana, the great charm of equatorial\r\nvegetation, tossed out luxuriantly its glossy green leaves, eight feet\r\nin length; the slender but graceful bamboo shot heavenward, straight as\r\nan arrow; and many species of palm bore aloft their feathery heads,\r\ninexpressibly light and elegant. On the branches of the independent\r\ntrees sat tufts of parasites, many of them orchids, which are here\r\nepiphytal; and countless creeping plants, whose long flexible stems\r\nentwined snake-like around the trunks, or formed gigantic loops and\r\ncoils among the limbs. Beneath this world of foliage above, thick beds\r\nof mimosæ covered the ground, and a boundless variety of ferns attracted\r\nthe eye by their beautiful patterns.[11] It is easy to specify the\r\nindividual objects of admiration in these grand scenes, but it is not\r\npossible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder,\r\nastonishment, and devotion which fill and elevate the mind. This road to\r\nthe Andes is a paradise to the contemplative man. \"There is something in\r\na tropical forest (says Bates) akin to the ocean in its effects on the\r\nmind. Man feels so completely his insignificance, and the vastness of\r\nnature.\" The German traveler Burmeister observes that \"the contemplation\r\nof a Brazilian forest produced on him a painful impression, on account\r\nof the vegetation displaying a spirit of restless selfishness, eager\r\nemulation, and craftiness.\" He thought the softness, earnestness, and\r\nrepose of European woodland scenery were far more pleasing, and that\r\nthese formed one of the causes of the superior moral character of\r\nEuropean nations. Live and let live is certainly not the maxim taught in\r\nthese tropical forests, and it is equally clear that selfishness is not\r\nwanting among the people. Here, in view of so much competition among\r\norganized beings, is the spot to study Darwin's \"Origin of Species.\" We\r\nhave thought that the vegetation under the equator was a fitter emblem\r\nof the human world than the forests of our temperate zone. There is here\r\nno set time for decay and death, but we stand amid the living and the\r\ndead; flowers and leaves are falling, while fresh ones are budding into\r\nlife. Then, too, the numerous parasitic plants, making use of their\r\nneighbors as instruments for their own advancement, not inaptly\r\nrepresent a certain human class.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Ferns constitute one sixth of the flora of South America;\r\nSpruce counted 140 species within the space of three square miles. Their\r\nlimits of growth are 500 and 7000 feet above the sea.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     Our Tambo.--Ascending the Andes.--Camino Real.--Magnificent\r\n     Views.--Guaranda.--Cinchona.--The Summit.--Chimborazo.--Over the\r\n     Andes.--Chuquipoyo the Wretched.--Ambato.--A Stupid\r\n     City.--Cotopaxi.--The Vale of Machachi.--Arrival at Quito.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached Savaneta at 5 P.M. This little village of hardly twenty\r\nhouses becomes the Bodegas, or place of deposit for the mountains six\r\nmonths in the year, for in the _invierno_ the roads are flooded, and\r\ncanoes take the place of mules from Savaneta to Babahoyo. Even in the\r\ndry season the dampness of this wilderness is so great that the\r\ntraveler's sugar and chocolate are melted into one, and envelopes seal\r\nthemselves. We put up at a _tambo_, or wayside inn, a simple two-storied\r\nbamboo hovel, thatched with plantain leaves without and plastered with\r\ncobwebs within, yet a palace compared with what sheltered us afterward.\r\nThe only habitable part was the second story, which was reached by a\r\ncouple of notched bamboo sticks. A hammock, two earthen kettles, two\r\nplates, and a few calabashes constituted the household furniture. The\r\ndormitory was well ventilated, for two sides were open. Our lodging,\r\nhowever, cost us nothing; travelers only pay for _yerba_ for their\r\nbeasts. Though this has been the royal road to Quito for three\r\ncenturies, there is but one _posada_ between Guayaquil and Ambato, a\r\ndistance of one hundred and fifty miles; travelers must carry their own\r\nbedding and provisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ascending the Andes.]\r\n\r\nLeaving Savaneta at dawn, and breakfasting at a wayside hut owned by an\r\nold negro, we struck about noon the Rio Charriguajaco, dashing down the\r\nmountains in hot haste for the Guayas. It was refreshing to look upon\r\nliving waters for the first time since leaving the hills of our\r\nnative country. Fording this stream we know not how many times, and\r\nwinding through the dense forest in narrow paths often blockaded by\r\nladen donkeys that doggedly disputed the passage, we soon found\r\nourselves slowly creeping up the Andes. We frequently met mountaineers\r\non their way to Bodegas with loads of potatoes, peas, barley, fowls,\r\neggs, etc. They are generally accompanied by their wives or daughters,\r\nwho ride like the men, but with the knees tucked up higher. On the\r\nslippery tracks which traverse this western slope, bulls are often used\r\nas beasts of burden, the cloven hoofs enabling them to descend with\r\ngreat security. But mules are better than horses or asses. \"That a\r\nhybrid (muses Darwin) should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy,\r\nsocial affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life than\r\neither of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nToward evening the ascent became rapid and the road horrible beyond\r\nconception, growing narrower and rougher as we advanced. Indeed, our way\r\nhad long since ceased to be a road. In the dense forest, where sunshine\r\nnever comes, rocks, mud, and fallen trees in rapid alternation\r\nmacadamize the path, save where it turns up the bed of a babbling brook.\r\nIn the comparatively level tracts, the equable step of the beasts has\r\nworn the soil into deep transverse ridges, called _camellones_, from\r\ntheir resemblance to the humps on a camel's back. In the precipitous\r\nparts the road is only a gully worn by the transit of men and beasts for\r\nages, aided by torrents of water in the rainy season. As we ascend, this\r\nchanges to a rocky staircase, so strait that one must throw up his legs\r\nto save them from being crushed, and so steep that horse and rider run\r\nthe risk of turning a somersault. It is fearful to meet in a narrow\r\ndefile, or where the road winds around the edge of a precipice, a drove\r\nof reckless donkeys and mules descending the mountain, urged on by the\r\ncries and lashes of the muleteers behind. Yet this has been the highway\r\nof Ecuadorian commerce for three hundred years. In vain we tried to\r\nreach the little village of Camino Real on the crest of the ridge; but\r\nthe night was advancing rapidly, and crawling up such a road by\r\nstarlight was not a little dangerous. So we put up at a miserable tambo,\r\nPogyos by name. It was a mud hut of the rudest kind, windowless and\r\nunfloored; very clean, if it had been left to nature, but man and beast\r\nhad rendered it intolerably filthy. Our hostess, a Quichua woman, with\r\ntattered garments, and hair disheveled and standing up as if\r\nelectrified, set a kettle on three stones, and, making a fire under it,\r\nprepared for us a calabash of chicken and _locro_. _Locro_, the national\r\ndish in the mountains, is in plain English simply potato soup. Sitting\r\non the ground, we partook of this refreshment by the aid of fingers and\r\nwooden spoons, enticing our appetites by the reflection that potato soup\r\nwould support life. The unkempt Indian by our side, grinning in\r\nconscious pride over her successful cookery, did not aid us in this\r\nmatter. Fire is used in Ecuador solely for culinary purposes, not for\r\nwarmth. It is made at no particular spot on the mud floor, and there is\r\nno particular orifice for the exit of the smoke save the chinks in the\r\nwall. There is not a chimney in the whole republic. As the spare room in\r\nthe establishment belonged to the women, we gentlemen slept on the\r\nground outside, or on beds made of round poles. The night was piercingly\r\ncold. The wished-for morning came at last, and long before the sun\r\nlooked over the mountains we were on our march. It was the same terrible\r\nroad, running zigzag, or \"quingo\" fashion, up to Camino Real, where it\r\nwas suddenly converted into a royal highway.\r\n\r\nWe were now fairly out of the swamps of the lowlands, and, though under\r\nthe equator, out of the tropics too. The fresh mountain breeze and the\r\nchilly mists announced a change of climate.[12] Fevers and dysenteries,\r\nsnakes and musquitoes, the plantain and the palm, we had left behind.\r\nCamino Real is a huddle of eight or ten dwellings perched on the summit\r\nof a sierra a thousand feet higher than the top of Mount Washington. The\r\nviews from this stand-point compensate for all past troubles. The wild\r\nchaos of mountains on every side, broken by profound ravines, the heaps\r\nof ruins piled up during the lapse of geologic ages, the intense azure\r\nof the sky, and the kingly condor majestically wheeling around the still\r\nhigher pinnacles, make up a picture rarely to be seen. Westward, the\r\nmountains tumble down into hills and spread out into plains, which, in\r\nthe far distant horizon, dip into the great Pacific. The setting sun\r\nturns the ocean into a sheet of liquid fire. Long columns of purple\r\nlight shoot up to the zenith, and as the last point of the sun sinks\r\nbeneath the horizon, the stars rush out in full splendor; for at the\r\nequator day gives place to night with only an hour and twenty minutes of\r\ntwilight. The mountains are Alpine, yet grander than the Alps; not so\r\nragged as the granite peaks of Switzerland, but with rounder heads. The\r\nprospect down this occidental slope is diversified by deep valleys,\r\nlands-lides, and flowering trees. Magnificent are the views eastward,\r\n\r\n    \"Where Andes, giant of the western star,\r\n    Looks from his throne of clouds o'er half the world.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The altitude of 7000 feet is the usual limit of the\r\nrain-line on the west slope of the Andes. The condensation which\r\nproduces rain takes place at the equator two or three times higher than\r\nin our latitude.]\r\n\r\nThe majestic dome of Chimborazo was entirely uncovered of clouds, and\r\npresented a most splendid spectacle. There it stood, its snow-white\r\nsummit, unsullied by the foot of man, towering up twice as high as Etna.\r\nFor many years it received the homage of the world as the highest point\r\nin America; but now the Aconcagua of Chile claims the palm. Still, what\r\na panorama from the top of Chimborazo, could one reach it, for the eye\r\nwould command ten thousand square miles!\r\n\r\nOur road gently winds down the sierra, giving us at every turn sublime\r\nideas of what nature can do in tossing up the thin crust of our globe.\r\nBut sublimity is at a discount here--there is too much of it. Suddenly\r\nwe are looking down into the enchanting valley of Chimbo. This romantic\r\nand secluded spot is one of those forgotten corners of the earth which,\r\nbarricaded against the march of civilization by almost impassable\r\nmountains, and inhabited by a thriftless race, has been left far behind\r\nin the progress of mankind. Distance lends enchantment to the view. We\r\nare reminded of the pastoral vales of New England. Wheat takes the place\r\nof the sugar-cane, barley of cacao, potatoes of plantains, and turnips\r\nof oranges. Bamboo sheds have given way to neatly whitewashed villages,\r\nand the fields are fenced with rows of aloe. But, drawing nearer, we\r\nfind the habitations are in reality miserable mud hovels, without\r\nwindows, and tenanted by vermin and ragged poverty. There are herds of\r\ncattle and fields of grain; yet we shall not find a quart of milk or a\r\nloaf of bread for sale. The descent into the valley is very precipitous,\r\nand, after a rain, alarmingly slippery. Mules, drawing their legs\r\ntogether, slide down with startling velocity, and follow the windings\r\nwith marvelous dexterity.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Guaranda at 5 P.M. on the third day after leaving Bodegas.\r\nThis is a desolate town of two thousand souls, dwelling in low\r\ndilapidated huts made of the most common building material in the\r\nAndes--_adobe_, or sun-dried blocks of mud mingled with straw.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: From _adoub_, an Egyptian word still used by the Copts;\r\ncarried by the Moors to Spain, thence to America; and from America the\r\nword has gone to the Sandwich Islands.]\r\n\r\nThe streets are rudely paved, and pitch to the centre, to form an\r\naqueduct, like the streets of old Sychar. The inhabitants are in happy\r\nignorance of the outside world. They pass the day without a thought of\r\nwork, standing on the Plaza, or in front of some public office, staring\r\nvacantly into space, or gossiping. A cockfight will soonest rouse them\r\nfrom their lethargy. They seem to have no purpose in life but to keep\r\nwarm under their ponchos and to eat when they are hungry. Guaranda is a\r\nhealthy locality, lying in a deep valley on the west bank of the Chimbo,\r\nat an elevation, according to our barometer, of 8840 feet, and having a\r\nmean temperature slightly less than that of Quito. It is a place of\r\nimportance, inasmuch as it is the resting-place before ascending or\r\nafter descending the still loftier ranges, and much more because it is\r\nthe capital of the region which yields the invaluable _cinchona_, or\r\nPeruvian bark.[14] This tree is indigenous to the Andes, where it is\r\nfound on the western slope between the altitudes of two thousand and\r\nnine thousand feet, the species richest in alkaloids occupying the\r\nhigher elevations, where the air is moist. Dr. Weddell enumerates\r\ntwenty-one species, seven of which are now found in Ecuador, but the\r\nonly one of value is the the _C. succirubra_ (the _calisaya_ has run\r\nout), and this is now nearly extinct, as the trees have been destroyed\r\nto obtain the bark. This species is a beautiful tree, having large,\r\nbroadly oval, deep green, shining leaves, white, fragrant flowers, and\r\nred bark, and sometimes, though rarely, attains the height of sixty\r\nfeet. A tree five feet in circumference will yield fifteen hundred\r\npounds of green bark, or eight hundred of the dry. The roots contain the\r\nmost alkaloid, though the branches are usually barked for commerce. The\r\ntrue cinchona barks, containing quinine, quinidine, and cinchonine, are\r\ndistinguished from the false by their splintery-fibrous texture, the\r\nlatter being pre-eminently corky. The cascarilleros begin to hunt for\r\nbark in August. Dr. Taylor, of Riobamba, found one tree which gave $3600\r\nworth of quinine. The general yield is from three to five pounds to a\r\nquintal of bark. The tree has been successfully transplanted to the\r\nUnited States, and particularly to India, where there are now over a\r\nmillion of plants. It was introduced into India by Markham in 1861. The\r\nbark is said to be stronger than that from Ecuador, yielding twice as\r\nmuch alkaloid, or eleven per cent. The quinine of commerce will\r\ndoubtless come hereafter from the slopes of the Himalayas instead of the\r\nAndes. In 1867 only five thousand pounds of bark were exported from\r\nGuayaquil. The Indians use the bark of another tree, the _Maravilla_,\r\nwhich is said to yield a much stronger alkaloid than cinchona. It grows\r\nnear Pallatanga.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: This celebrated febrifuge was first taken to Europe about\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century, and was named after the Countess\r\nof Chinchon, who had been cured of intermittent fever at Lima.\r\nAfterward, when Cardinal de Lugo spread the knowledge of the remedy\r\nthrough France, and recommended it to Cardinal Mazarin, it received the\r\nname of _Jesuits' Bark_. The French chemists, Pelletier and Caverton,\r\ndiscovered quinine in 1820.]\r\n\r\nWe left Guaranda at 5 A.M. by the light of Venus and Orion, having\r\nexchanged our horses for the sure-footed mule. It was a romantic ride.\r\nFrom a neighboring stand-point Church took one of his celebrated views\r\nof \"The Heart of the Andes.\" But the road, as aforetime, was a mere\r\nfurrow, made and kept by the tread of beasts. For a long distance the\r\ntrack runs over the projecting and jagged edges of steeply-inclined\r\nstrata of slate, which nobody has had the energy to smooth down. At many\r\nplaces on the road side were human skulls, set in niches in the bank,\r\ntelling tales of suffering in their ghastly silence; while here and\r\nthere a narrow passage was blocked up by the skeleton or carcass of a\r\nbeast that had borne its last burden. At nine o'clock we came out on a\r\nnarrow, grassy ridge called the Ensillada, or Saddleback, where there\r\nwere three straw huts, with roofs resting on the ground, and there we\r\nbreakfasted on _locro_. During our stay the Indians killed a pig, and\r\nbefore the creature was fairly dead dry grass was heaped upon it and set\r\non fire. This is the ordinary method of removing the bristles.\r\n\r\nStill ascending, we lose sight of the valley of the Chimbo, and find\r\nourselves in a wilderness of crags and treeless mountains clothed with\r\nthe long, dreary-looking paramo grass called _paja_. But we are face to\r\nface with \"the monarch of the Andes,\" and we shall have its company the\r\nrest of the day. The snowy dome is flooded with the golden light of\r\nheaven; delicate clouds of softest hues float around its breast; while,\r\nfar below, its feet are wrapped in the baser mists of earth. We attained\r\nthe summit of the pass at 11 A.M. All travelers strive to reach it early\r\nin the morning, for in the afternoon it is swept by violent winds which\r\nrender it uncomfortable, if not dangerous. This part of the road is\r\ncalled the \"Arenal,\" from the sand and gravel which cover it. It is\r\nabout a league in length, and crosses the side of Chimborazo at an\r\nelevation of more than fourteen thousand feet. Chimborazo stands on the\r\nleft of the traveler. How tantalizing its summit! It appears so easy of\r\naccess; and yet many a valiant philosopher, from Humboldt down, has\r\npanted for the glory and failed. The depth of the snow and numerous\r\nprecipices are the chief obstacles; but the excessively rarefied air is\r\nanother hinderance. Even in crossing the Arenal, a native of the\r\nlowlands complains of violent headache, a propensity to vomit, and a\r\ndifficulty of breathing. The Arenal is often swept by snow-storms; and\r\nhistory has it that some of the Spanish conquerors were here frozen to\r\ndeath. The pale yellow gravel is considered by some geologists as the\r\nmoraine of a glacier. It is spread out like a broad gravel walk, so\r\nthat, without exaggeration, one of the best roads in Ecuador has been\r\nmade by Nature's hand on the crest of the Andes.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to trace the different hypsometrical zones by the\r\nchange of vegetation from Bodegas to this lofty spot. The laws of the\r\ndecrease of heat are plainly written on the rapid slopes of the\r\nCordilleras. On the hot, steaming lowlands of the coast reign bananas\r\nand palms. As these thin out, tree-ferns take their place. Losing these,\r\nwe found the cinchona bedewed by the cool clouds of Guaranda; and last\r\nof all, among the trees, the polylepis. The twisted, gnarled trunk of\r\nthis tree, as well as its size and silvery foliage, reminded us of the\r\nolive, but the bark resembles that of the birch. It reaches the greatest\r\nelevation of any tree on the globe. Then followed shrubby fuchsia,\r\ncalceolaria, eupatoria, and red and purple gentians; around and on the\r\nArenal, a uniform mantle of monocotyledonous plants, with scattered\r\ntufts of valeriana, viola, and geranium, all with rigid leaves in the\r\ncharacteristic rosettes of super-alpine vegetation; and on the\r\nporphyritic and trachytic sides of Chimborazo, lichens alone. Snow then\r\ncovers the last effort of vegetable life.[15] The change in the\r\narchitecture of the houses indicated, likewise, a change of altitude.\r\nThe open bamboo huts, shingled with banana leaves, were followed by\r\nwarmer _adobe_ houses, and these, in turn, by the straw hovels of the\r\nmountain-top, made entirely of the long, wiry grass of the paramos.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: According to Sir J. Hooker, among the flowers which adorn\r\nthe slopes of the Himalayas, rhododendrons occupy the most prominent\r\nplace, and primroses next. There are no orchids, neither red gentians,\r\nbut blue. Organic life ceases 3000 feet lower than on the Andes; yet it\r\nis affirmed that flowering plants occur at the height of 18,460 feet,\r\nwhich is equivalent to the summit of Chimborazo in point of temperature!\r\nThe polylepis (_P. racemosa_) is one of the _Sanguisorbaceæ_; in Quichua\r\nit is _Sachaquinoa_.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the Arenal, we rapidly descended by the usual style of\r\nroad--stone stairs. But down we went, as all the goods for Quito, \"the\r\ngrand capital,\" have done since the Spanish Conquest. The old road from\r\nBeirût to Damascus is royal in comparison. The general aspect of the\r\neastern slope is that of a gray, barren waste, overgrown with _paja_;\r\nbut now and then we crossed deep gulleys, whose sides were lined with\r\nmosses and sprinkled with calceolarias, lupines, etc. In our descent we\r\nhad before us the magnificent Valley of Quito, and beyond it the eastern\r\nCordillera. Below us was Riobamba, and far away to the right the deep\r\ngorge of the Pastassa. Nevertheless, this is one of the loneliest rides\r\nearth can furnish. Not a tree nor human habitation is in sight. Icy\r\nrivulets and mule-trains are the only moving objects on this melancholy\r\nheath. Even \"Drake's Plantation Bitters,\" painted on the volcanic cliffs\r\nof Chimborazo, would be a relief.\r\n\r\nAt last we reached our rude accommodations for the night. It was a\r\nsolitary mud tambo, glorying in the euphonious name of Chuquipoyo. The\r\ncourt-yard was a sea of mud and manure, for this is the halting-place\r\nfor all the caravans between Quito and the coast. Our room was a horrid\r\nhole, dark, dirty, damp, and cold, without a window or a fire. There was\r\none old rickety bedstead, but as that belonged to the lady in our party,\r\nthe rest betook themselves to benches, table, and floor. We filled our\r\nstomachs with an unpalatable potato soup containing cheese and eggs, and\r\nlaid down--to wait for the morning. Grass is the only fuel here; but\r\nthis is not the chief reason why it is so difficult to make good tea or\r\ncook potatoes at this wretched tambo. Water boils at 190°, or before it\r\nis fairly hot: it is well the potatoes are small. The muleteers slept\r\nwith their beasts outside, though the night was fearfully cold, for\r\nChuquipoyo lies on the frigid side of Chimborazo, at an elevation of\r\nover twelve thousand feet above the sea. As Johnson said to Boswell,\r\n\"This is a dolorous place.\"\r\n\r\nGladly we left this cheerless tambo, though a cold, heavy mist was\r\nfalling as we rode northward, over the seemingly endless paramo of\r\nSanancajas. Here, as throughout the highlands of Ecuador, ditches are\r\nused for fences; so that, should the traveler wander from the path, he\r\nfinds himself stopped by an impassable gulf. In two hours and a half we\r\nreached Mocha, a lifeless pueblo under the shadow of Carguairazo. Slowly\r\ndescending from our high altitude, we gradually entered a more congenial\r\nclimate--the zone of wheat and barley, till, finally, signs of an\r\neternal spring were all around us--ripening corn on one side, and\r\nblossoming peas on the other.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the road led us through a sandy, sterile tract,\r\ntill suddenly we came in sight of Ambato, beautifully situated in a deep\r\nravine, eight thousand five hundred and fifty feet above the Pacific.\r\nThe city ranks next to Quito in beauty. It is certainly an oasis, the\r\ngreen foliage of its numerous shade-trees and orchards contrasting with\r\nthe barren hills around. It is two degrees warmer than Quito, and is\r\nfamous for its fruit and fine climate. It is the Lynn of Ecuador, the\r\nchief articles of manufacture being boots and shoes--cheap, but of poor\r\nquality. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1698. The houses are built\r\nof sun-dried brick, and whitewashed. The streets, with gutters in the\r\ncentre, are at right angles, and paved, and adorned with numerous\r\ncypress-looking trees, called _sauce_, a species of willow. The Plaza,\r\nwhich contains a useful if not ornamental fountain, presents a lively\r\nscene on Sunday, the great market-day. The inn is a fair specimen of a\r\npublic house in Spanish America. Around the court-yard, where the beasts\r\nare fed, are three or four rooms to let. They are ventilated only when\r\nopened for travelers. The floor is of brick, but alive with fleas; the\r\nwalls are plastered, but veiled with cobwebs. The furniture, of\r\nprimitive make and covered with dust, consists of a chair or two, a\r\ntable, and a bed of boards covered with a thin straw mat. There is not a\r\nhotel in Ecuador where sheets and towels are furnished. The landlords\r\nare seldom seen; the entire management of the concern is left to a\r\nslovenly Indian boy, who is both cook and hostler. No amount of bribery\r\nwill secure a meal in less than two hours. Ten years ago there was not a\r\nposada in the country; now there is entertainment for man and beast at\r\nGuayaquil, Guaranda, Mocha, Ambato, Tacunga, Machachi, and Quito.\r\nRiobamba has a billiard saloon, but no inn.\r\n\r\nLeaving Ambato, we breakfasted at Cunchebamba, an Indian village of half\r\na dozen straw huts. Thence the road for a long distance winds through\r\nvast deposits of volcanic _débris_, the only sign of vegetation being\r\nhedges of aloe and cactus. Arid hills and dreary plains, covered with\r\nplutonic rocks and pumice dust, tell us we are approaching the most\r\nterrible volcano on the earth. Crossing the sources of the Pastassa, we\r\nentered Latacunga,[16] situated on a beautiful plain at the foot of\r\nCotopaxi, seven hundred feet higher than Ambato. Its average temperature\r\nis 59°. The population, chiefly Indians, numbers about fifteen thousand.\r\nIt is the dullest city in Ecuador, without the show of enterprise or\r\nbusiness. Not even grass grows in the streets--the usual sign of life in\r\nthe Spanish towns. It is also one of the filthiest; and though it has\r\nbeen many times thoroughly shaken by earthquakes, and buried under\r\nshowers of volcanic dust, it is still the paradise of fleas, which have\r\nsurvived every revolution. Ida Pfeiffer says that, after a night's rest\r\nin Latacunga, she awoke with her skin marked all over with red spots, as\r\nif from an eruptive disease. We can certify that we have been tattoed\r\nwithout the night's rest. The town has a most stupid and forlorn aspect.\r\nHalf of it is in ruins. It was four times destroyed between 1698 and\r\n1797. In 1756 the Jesuit church was thrown down, though its walls were\r\nfive feet thick. The houses are of one story, and built of pumice,\r\nwidely different from the palaces and temples which are said to have\r\nstood here in the palmy days of the Incas. Cotopaxi stands threateningly\r\nnear, and its rumbling thunder is the source of constant alarm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: This is shortened in parlance to Tacunga. The full name,\r\naccording to La Condamine, is _Llacta-cunga_, _llacta_ meaning country,\r\nand _cunga_, neck.]\r\n\r\nFrom Latacunga to Quito there is a very fine carriage road, the result\r\nof one man's administration--Señor G. Garcia Moreno. For many miles it\r\npasses over an uncultivated plateau, strewn with volcanic fragments. The\r\nfarms are confined to the slopes of the Cordilleras, and, as every where\r\nelse, the tumbling haciendas indicate the increasing poverty of the\r\nowner. Superstition and indolence go hand in hand. On a great rock\r\nrising out of the sandy plain they show a print of the foot of St.\r\nBartholomew, who alighted here on a visit--surely to the volcanoes, as\r\nit was long before the red man had found this valley. Abreast of\r\nCotopaxi the road cuts through high hills of fine pumice\r\ninter-stratified with black earth, and rapidly ascends till it reaches\r\nTiupullo, eleven thousand five hundred feet above the sea. This high\r\nridge,[17] stretching across the valley from Cotopaxi to Iliniza, is a\r\npart of the great water-shed of the continent--the waters on the\r\nsouthern slope flowing through the Pastassa and Amazon to the Atlantic,\r\nthose on the north finding their way to the Pacific by the Rio\r\nEsmeraldas. At this bleak place we breakfasted on punch and guinea-pig.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Sometimes called _Chisinche_.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as we began to descend, the glittering cone of Cotopaxi, and the\r\ngloomy plain it has so often devastated, passed out of view, and before\r\nus was a green valley exceedingly rich and well cultivated, girt by a\r\nwall of mountains, the towers of which were the peaks of Corazon and\r\nRumiñagui. Loathsome lepers by the wayside alone disturbed the pleasing\r\nimpression. Three hours more of travel brought us to the straggling\r\nvillage of Machachi, standing in the centre of the beautiful plain, at\r\nan altitude of nine thousand nine hundred feet. Nature designed this\r\nspot for a home of plenty and comfort, but the habitations of the\r\nwretched proprietors are windowless adobe hovels, thatched with dried\r\ngrass, and notorious for their filth.\r\n\r\nWe must needs make one more ascent, for the ridge of Tambillo hides the\r\ngoal of our journey. The moment we reached the summit, views\r\nunparalleled in the Andes or any where else met our astonished vision\r\nwhithersoever we looked. Far away to the south stretched the two\r\nCordilleras, till they were lost in the mist which enshrouded Chimborazo\r\nand Tunguragua. Turning to the north, we beheld the city of Quito at our\r\nfeet, and Pichincha and Antisana standing like gallant sentinels on\r\neither side of the proud capital. Beautiful were the towering mountains,\r\nand almost as delightful now are the memories of that hour. A broad,\r\nwell-traveled road, gentlemen on horseback clad in rich ponchos, droves\r\nof Indians bowed under their heavy burdens, and long lines of laden\r\ndonkeys hurrying to and fro, indicate our approach to a great city.\r\nWinding with the road through green pastures and fields of ripening\r\ngrain, and crossing the Machángara by an elegant bridge, we enter the\r\ncity of the Incas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     Early History of Quito.--Its Splendor under the Incas.--Crushed by\r\n     Spain.--Dying now.--Situation.--Altitude.--Streets.--Buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuito is better known than Ecuador. Its primeval history, however, is\r\nlost in obscurity. In the language of Prescott, \"the mists of fable have\r\nsettled as darkly round its history as round that of any nation, ancient\r\nor modern, in the Old World.\" Founded, nobody knows when, by the kings\r\nof the Quitus, it was conquered about the year 1000 by a more civilized\r\nrace, the Cara nation, who added to it by conquest and alliance. The\r\nfame of the region excited the cupidity of the Incas of Peru, and during\r\nthe reign of Cacha (1475), Huayna-Capac the Great moved his army from\r\nCuzco, and by the celebrated battle of Hatuntaqui, in which Cacha was\r\nkilled, Quito was added to the realm of the Incas. Huayna-Capac made\r\nQuito his residence, and reigned there thirty-eight years--the most\r\nbrilliant epoch in the annals of the city. At his death his kingdom was\r\ndivided, one son, Atahuallpa,[18] reigning in Quito, and Huascar at\r\nCuzco. Civil war ensued, in which the latter was defeated, and\r\nAtahuallpa was chosen Inca of the whole empire, 1532. During this war\r\nPizarro arrived at Tumbez. Every body knows what followed. Strangled at\r\nCaxamarca, the body of Atahuallpa was carried to Quito, the city of his\r\nbirth, in compliance with his dying wish, and buried there with imposing\r\nobsequies. Refounded by Benalcazar in 1534, Quito was created an\r\nimperial city by Charles V. seven years later. It formed part of Peru\r\ntill 1710; then of Santa Fé till 1722; and again of Peru till its\r\nindependence. The power of Spain in South America was destroyed at the\r\nbattle of Ayacucho, Dec. 9, 1824. In 1830 Venezuela separated from\r\nColombia, and Ecuador followed the same year. The first Congress was\r\nheld in Riobamba; but Quito has ever since been the political focus. The\r\nfirst president was General Flores.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: The son of his Quito love. The name was first written\r\n_Atauhuallpa_, meaning fortunate in war; after the fratricide, he was\r\ncalled _Atahuallpa_, or game-cock. He was the Boabdil of this occidental\r\nGranada. He is called traitor by Peruvian writers, and is not admitted\r\nby them into the list of their Incas.]\r\n\r\nUnder the diadem of the Incas, Quito assumed a magnificence which it\r\nnever saw before and has not displayed since. It was the worthy\r\nmetropolis of a vast empire stretching from the equator to the desert of\r\nAtacama, and walled in by the grandest group of mountains in the world.\r\nOn this lofty site, which amid the Alps would be buried in an avalanche\r\nof snow, but within the tropics enjoys an eternal spring, palaces more\r\nbeautiful than the Alhambra were erected, glittering with the gold and\r\nemerald of the Andes. But all this splendor passed away with the sceptre\r\nof Atahuallpa. Where the pavilion of the Inca stood is now a gloomy\r\nconvent, and a wheat-field takes the place of the Temple of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe colonial history of this favored spot is as lifeless as the history\r\nof Sahara. Not a single event occurred of which even Spain can be proud;\r\nnot a monument was raised which reflects any credit upon the mother\r\ncountry. Every thing was prescribed by law, and all law emanated from a\r\ntribunal five thousand miles distant. There was no relation of private\r\nlife with which the government did not interfere: what the colonist\r\nshould plant and what trade he should follow; where he should buy and\r\nwhere he should sell; how much he should import and export; and where\r\nand when he should marry, were regulated by the \"Council of the Indies\"\r\nand the Inquisition. In the words of a native writer, \"The great\r\nmajority of the people knew nothing of sciences, events, or men. Their\r\nreligion consisted of outward observances, and an imperfect knowledge of\r\nthe papal bulls; their morality, in asceticism and devotion to their\r\nking; their philosophy, in the subtleties of Aristotle; their history,\r\nin the history of the mother country; their geography, in the maps of\r\nSpanish America and of Spain; their press, in what sufficed to print\r\nbill-heads and blank forms; their commerce, in an insignificant coasting\r\ntrade; their ambition and highest aspirations, in titles of nobility;\r\ntheir amusements, in bull-fights. The arrival of a mail was an event of\r\ngreat moment, and with ringing of bells was received the _cajon de\r\nEspaña_ which announced the health of the sovereigns. Thus, while Europe\r\nwas passing through the stormy times of Louis XIV.; while the\r\nphilosophical writings of the illustrious men of those times found their\r\nway into the remotest corners of the globe; while the English colonies\r\nof North America conquered their independence; while the Old World was\r\ndrenched in blood to propagate the ideas which the French Revolution had\r\nproclaimed, the Presidency of Quito, walled in by its immense\r\ncordilleras and the ocean, and ruled by monkish ignorance and bigotry,\r\nknew as little of men and events as we now know of men and events in the\r\nmoon.\"[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Geografia de la República del Ecuador, por Dr.\r\nVillavicencio._ This work abounds with erroneous and exaggerated\r\nstatements, but it is nevertheless a valuable contribution to Ecuadorian\r\nliterature.]\r\n\r\nFrom an iron despotism which existed for three centuries, Quito passed\r\nto a state of unbridled licentiousness. Without any political experience\r\nwhatever, the people attempted to lay the foundation of a new system of\r\ngovernment and society. With head and hearts perverted by monkish\r\nsuperstition and Spanish tyranny, yet set on fire by the French\r\nRevolution, what did they know of liberty! Endless civil wars have\r\nfollowed independence. \"Political ambition,\" says a late United States\r\nminister, \"personal jealousies, impracticable theories, official\r\nvenality, reckless disregard of individual rights and legal obligations,\r\nfoolish meddling and empirical legislation, and an absolute want of\r\npolitical morality, form the principal features of their republican\r\nhistory.\"[20] To-day they tread on the dust of an ancient race whose\r\ngovernment was in every respect a most complete contrast to their own.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Four Years among Spanish Americans, by Hon. F.\r\nHassaurek_: a truthful work, to which we refer the reader for details,\r\nespecially concerning Ecuadorian life and manners.]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of volcanic Pichincha, only five hours' travel from its\r\nsmoking crater, lies \"the city above the clouds,\" \"the navel of the\r\nworld,\" \"magnificent Quito.\" On the north is the plain of Rumibamba, the\r\nbattle-field where Gonzalo Pizarro routed the first viceroy of Peru, and\r\nthe scene, two centuries later, of the nobler achievements of La\r\nCondamine, which made it the classic ground of astronomy. On the\r\nsouthern edge of the city rises Panecillo, reminding one of Mount Tabor\r\nby its symmetrical form, and over-looking the beautiful and well-watered\r\nplain of Turubamba. On the east flows the Rio Machángara, and just\r\nbeyond it stand the Puengasi hills hiding the Chillo valley, while the\r\nweary sun goes early to rest behind the towering peaks of Pichincha. So\r\nencircled is this sequestered spot, the traveler, approaching by the\r\nGuayaquil road, sees only a part of it, and is disappointed; and even\r\nwhen standing on Panecillo, with the entire city spread out before him,\r\nhe is not wholly satisfied. Buried between treeless, sombre sierras, and\r\nisolated from the rest of the world by impassable roads and gigantic\r\nCordilleras, Quito appears to us of the commercial nineteenth century as\r\nuseless as the old feudal towns perched on the mountains of Middle\r\nEurope. Not a chimney rises above the red-tiled roofs, telling of\r\nhomely hearths beneath. No busy hum greets the ear; there are bugles\r\ninstead of spindles, and jingling church bells in place of rattling\r\ncarriages. The wandering eye does not look for a railroad or a\r\ntelegraph, for even the highways, such as they are, seem deserted, and,\r\nsave the music made for soldiers and saints, all is silent. The very\r\nmountains, too, with their snow-mantled heads, and their sides scarred\r\nby volcanic eruptions and ruptured by earthquake shocks, have a\r\nmelancholy look. In the words of a great artist, \"They look like a world\r\nfrom which not only the human, but the spiritual presences had perished,\r\nand the last of the archangels, building the great Andes for their\r\nmonuments, had laid themselves down to eternal rest, each in his\r\nsnow-white shroud.\"\r\n\r\nBut let us enter. Passing the ruined chapel \"Del Señor del buen pasaje,\"\r\nand crossing by a substantial stone bridge the little Machángara\r\nhastening to pay tribute to the Pacific, we leave behind us the dirty,\r\ndilapidated suburbs of the capital. Soon we cross another bridge--the\r\nBridge of Buzzards--spanning a deep ravine, and gallop through the Plaza\r\nde Santo Domingo. Very different are the sights and sounds from the stir\r\nand style of Central Park. The scene has a semi-oriental cast--half\r\nIndian, half Egyptian, as if this were the confluence of the Marañon and\r\nNile. Groups of men--not crowds, for there is plenty of elbow-room in\r\nEcuador--in gay ponchos stand chatting in front of little shops, or lean\r\nagainst the wall to enjoy the sunshine; beggars in rags or sackcloth\r\nstretch forth their leprous hands for charity; monks in white, and\r\ncanons in black, walk in the shade of immense hats; shoeless soldiers\r\nsaunter to and fro; Indians from the mountains in every variety of\r\ncostume cluster around heaps of vegetables for sale; women in red,\r\nbrown, and blue frocks are peddling oranges and alligator pears, or\r\nbearing huge burdens on their heads; children, guiltless of clothing,\r\nand obtuse donkeys, wander whithersoever they will; and water-carriers,\r\nfilling their jars at the fountain, start off on a dog-trot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quito, from the North.]\r\n\r\nWe cross the Plaza diagonally, pass down the Calle de San Fernando, up\r\nthe Calle del Algodon, and through the busy Calle del Correo, till we\r\nreach the _Casa Frances_, opposite the mansion of the late General\r\nFlores. This is our hotel--owned by a Frenchman, but kept by an Indian.\r\nWe ride under the low archway, bowing with ill grace, like all\r\nrepublicans unaccustomed to royalty, tie our beasts in the court-yard,\r\nascend to our spacious quarters on the second floor, and, ordering\r\ncoffee, seat ourselves in the beautiful balcony to talk of Quito and\r\nQuitonians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water-carriers.]\r\n\r\nQuito, though not the highest city on the globe, is two thousand feet\r\nhigher than the Hospice of Great St. Bernard on the Alps, which is the\r\nonly permanent place of abode in Europe above six thousand five hundred\r\nfeet. When Mr. Hassaurek was appointed United States Minister to\r\nEcuador, he thanked Mr. Lincoln for conferring upon him the _highest_\r\ngift in his power. The mean result of our numerous observations with\r\nGreen's standard barometer places the Grand Plaza nine thousand five\r\nhundred and twenty feet above the sea, or fifty feet lower than the\r\ncalculation of Humboldt. Water boils at 194°.5. Cuzco and Potosi may\r\nsurpass it in altitude, but there is not a city in the world which can\r\nshow at once such a genial climate, such magnificent views, and such a\r\ncheckered history. It is unique likewise in its latitude, lying only\r\nfifteen miles below the equator; no other capital comes within three\r\nhundred miles of the equinoctial line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Street in Quito.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the plan of Quito in the days of Huayna-Capac, it\r\nis evident that the Spanish founders were guided more by the spurs of\r\nPichincha than by astronomy. The streets make an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees with the meridian, so that not a single public building faces\r\nany one of the four cardinal points of the compass. Two deep ravines\r\ncome down the mountain, and traverse the city from west to east. They\r\nare mostly covered by arches, on which the houses rest; but where they\r\nare open, they disclose as fit representatives of the place of torment\r\nas the Valley of Hinnom. The outline of the city is as irregular as its\r\nsurface. It incloses one square mile. Twenty streets, all of them\r\nstraiter than the apostolic one in Damascus, cross one another very\r\nnearly at right angles. None of them are too wide, and the walks are\r\npainfully narrow; but, thanks to Garcia Moreno, they are well paved. The\r\ninequality of the site, and its elevation above the Machángara, render\r\nthe drainage perfect.[21] The streets are dimly lighted by tallow\r\ncandles, every householder being obliged to hang out a lantern at 7\r\nP.M., unless there is moonshine. The candles, however, usually expire\r\nabout ten o'clock. There are three \"squares\"--Plaza Mayor, Plaza de San\r\nFrancisco, and Plaza de Santo Domingo. The first is three hundred feet\r\nsquare, and adorned with trees and flowers; the others are dusty and\r\nunpaved, being used as market-places, where Indians and donkeys most do\r\ncongregate. All the plazas have fountains fed with pure water from\r\nPichincha.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The following quotation, however, is true to the letter,\r\nand will apply equally well to Guayaquil and to Madrid--the mother of\r\nthem both: \"There is another want still more embarrassing in Quito than\r\nthe want of hotels--it is the want of water-closets and privies, which\r\nare not considered as necessary fixtures of private residences. Men,\r\nwomen, and children, of all ages and colors, may be seen in the middle\r\nof the street, in broad daylight, making privies of the most public\r\nthoroughfares; and while thus engaged, they will stare into the faces of\r\npassers-by with a shamelessness that beggars description.\"--_Hassaurek_.]\r\n\r\nFew buildings can boast of architectural beauty, yet Quito looks\r\npalatial to the traveler who has just emerged from the dense forest on\r\nthe coast, \"crossing bridgeless rivers, floundering over bottomless\r\nroads, and ascending and descending immense mountains.\" He is astonished\r\nto find such elegant edifices and such a proud aristocracy in this lofty\r\nlap of the Andes. The Indian habitations which girdle the city have no\r\nmore architectural pretensions than an Arab dwelling. They are low mud\r\nhovels, the scene within and without of dirt and disorder.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the Grand Plaza, the centre of the city, the buildings\r\nincrease in size, style, and finish. The ordinary material is adobe, not\r\nonly because it is cheap, but also because it best resists earthquake\r\nshocks. Fear of a _terremoto_ has likewise led to a massiveness in\r\nconstruction which is slightly ludicrous when we see the poverty which\r\nit protects; the walls are often two or three feet thick. The ground\r\nfloor is occupied by servants, whose rooms--small enough to be called\r\nniches--surround the paved court-yard, which is entered from the street\r\nby a broad doorway. Within this court is sometimes a fountain or\r\nflower-plot. Around it are arches or pillars supporting a gallery, which\r\nis the passage-way to the apartments of the second story. All the rooms\r\nare floored with large square bricks. With few exceptions, the only\r\nwindows are folding glass doors leading to balconies overhanging the\r\npavement. The tiled roofs project far over into the street, and from\r\nthese project still farther uncouth water-spouts, such as used to be\r\nseen in Rio Janeiro, but have now been banished to the antiquarian\r\nmuseum. Only three or four private residences rise above two stories.\r\nThe shops are small affairs--akin to the cupboards of Damascene\r\nmerchants; half a dozen modern ladies can keep out any more customers.\r\nThe door serves as entrance, exit, window, and show-case. The finest\r\nstructures cluster around the plazas. Here are the public buildings,\r\nsome of them dating back to the times of Philip II. They are modeled\r\nafter the old Spanish style; there is scarcely a fragment of Gothic\r\narchitecture. They are built of large brick, or a dark volcanic stone\r\nfrom Pichincha.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Palacio de Gobierno--Capitol.]\r\n\r\nThe Government House, which serves at once as \"White House\" and Capitol,\r\nis an imposing edifice fronting the Grand Plaza, and adorned with a fine\r\ncolonnade. On its right rises the cathedral; on the left stands the\r\nunpretending palace of the nuncio. The former would be called beautiful\r\nwere it kept in repair; it has a splendid marble porch, and a terrace\r\nwith carved stone balustrade. The view above was taken from this\r\nterrace. The finest façade is presented by the old Jesuit church, which\r\nhas an elaborate front of porphyry. The Church of San Francisco, built\r\nby the treasures of Atahuallpa, discovered by an Indian named Catuna, is\r\nthe richest. It is surmounted by two lofty towers, and the interior is a\r\nperfect blaze of gilding. The monastery attached to it is one of the\r\nlargest in the world, but the greater part of it is in ruins, and one of\r\nthe wings is used as a barrack. Those unsightly, unadorned convents,\r\nwhich cling to every church save the cathedral, have neutralized nearly\r\nall architectural effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     Population of\r\n     Quito.--Dress.--Manners.--Character.--Commerce.--Agriculture.\r\n     --Manufactures.--Arts.--Education.--Amusements.--Quito Ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuitonians claim for their capital eighty thousand inhabitants; but when\r\nwe consider that one fourth of the city is covered with ecclesiastical\r\nbuildings, and that the dwelling-houses are but two stories high, we see\r\nthat there is not room for more than half that number. From thirty\r\nthousand to forty thousand is the estimate of the venerable Dr. Jameson,\r\nwho has resided here for a generation.[22] Census taking is as difficult\r\nas in Constantinople; the people hide themselves to escape taxation. The\r\nwomen far outnumber the men. The white population--a stiff aristocracy\r\nof eight thousand souls--is of Spanish descent, but not more than half a\r\ndozen can boast of pure blood. The coarse black hair, prominent\r\ncheek-bones, and low foreheads, reveal an Indian alliance. This is the\r\ngoverning class; from its ranks come those uneasy politicians who make\r\nlaws for other people to obey, and hatch revolutions when a rival party\r\nis in power. They are blessed with fair mental capacity, quick\r\nperception, and uncommon civility; but they lack education and industry,\r\nenergy and perseverance. Their wealth, which is not great, consists\r\nmainly in _haciendas_, yielding grain, cotton, and cattle. The Aguirre\r\nfamily is one of the noblest and wealthiest in the city; their mansion\r\nis on the Grand Plaza, facing the Capitol. The pure Indians of Quito\r\nnumber perhaps 10,000; not all those seen in the city are citizens, as\r\nmany _serranos_, or mountaineers, come in to sell produce. They are the\r\nserfs that do the drudgery of the republic; they are the tillers of the\r\nsoil, and beasts of burden. Many sell themselves for money in advance,\r\nand then are ever kept in debt. Excepting a few Zambos (the children of\r\nIndians and Negroes), and a very few foreigners and Negroes, the\r\nremainder, constituting the bulk of the population, are Cholos--the\r\noffspring of whites and Indians. They are not strictly half-breeds, for\r\nthe Indian element stands out most prominent. Though a mixed race, they\r\nare far superior to their progenitors in enterprise and intelligence.\r\nThey are the soldiers, artisans, and tradesmen who keep up the only\r\nsigns of life in Quito. \"I know not the reason,\" says Darwin, \"but men\r\nof such origin seldom have a good expression of countenance.\" This may\r\nbe true on the pampas, but Quito, where there is every imaginable\r\nmixture of Indian and Spaniard, is wonderfully free from ugly features.\r\nIt may be owing to the more peaceful and civilized history of this\r\nmountain city.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Spanish rhetoric is given to exaggeration. \"All their\r\ngeese are swans.\" A Peruvian assured us that Cuzco contained 200,000\r\nsouls. It is, in fact, about as large as Quito; Gibbon says 20,000.]\r\n\r\nAs to dress, black is the color of etiquette, but is not so national as\r\nin Madrid. The upper class follow _la mode de Paris_, gentlemen adding\r\nthe classic cloak of Old Spain. This modern toga fits an Ecuadorian\r\nadmirably; it favors habits of inactivity, preventing the arms from\r\ndoing any thing, and covers a multitude of sins, especially pride and\r\npoverty. The _poncho_, so peculiar to the West Coast and to the Gauchos\r\nof Buenos Ayres, is a piece of cloth of divers colors, with a slit in\r\nthe centre, through which the head is passed. It is the only variable\r\narticle of the wardrobe. It is an excellent riding habit, and is made of\r\nheavy woolen for mountain travel, and of silk or cotton for warmer\r\naltitudes. No gentleman will be seen walking in the streets of Quito\r\nunder a poncho. Hence citizens are divided into men with ponchos, and\r\ngentlemen with cloaks. The pañuelon is the most essential article of\r\nfemale gear. It answers to the mantilla of the mother country, though it\r\nis not worn so gracefully as on the banks of the Tagus. Andean ladies\r\nare not troubled with the distressing fluctuations in the style of hats;\r\na bonnet in Quito is as much out of place as a turban in New York. When\r\nthe daughter of our late minister resident appeared in the cathedral\r\nwith one, the innovation was the subject of severe remark. The Spanish\r\nhair is the glory of the sex. It is thick and black (red, being a\r\nrarity, is considered a beauty), and is braided in two long tresses. A\r\nsilk dress, satin shoes, and fancy jewelry complete the visible attire\r\nof the belles of Quito.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary costume of the Indians and Cholos consists of a coarse\r\ncotton shirt and drawers, and silk, cotton, or woolen poncho of native\r\nmanufacture, the females adding a short petticoat, generally of a light\r\nblue or \"butter-nut\" color, belted around the waist with a figured\r\nwoolen belt woven by themselves. The head, arms, legs, and feet are\r\noften bare, but, by those who can afford it, the head is covered with a\r\nstraw or white felt broad-brim, and the feet protected by sandals,\r\ncalled _alpargates_, made of the fibres of the aloe. They are very fond\r\nof bracelets and necklaces. Infants are usually swathed from neck to\r\nfeet with a broad strip of cloth, so that they look like live mummies.\r\n\r\nQuitonians put us to shame by their unequaled courtesy, cordiality, and\r\ngood-nature, and are not far below the grave and decorous Castilian in\r\ndignified politeness.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: \"I must express my admiration at the natural politeness of\r\nalmost every Chileno. We met, near Mendoza, a little and very fat\r\nnegress, riding astride on a mule. She had a _goître_ so enormous that\r\nit was scarcely possible to avoid gazing at her for a moment; but my two\r\ncompanions almost instantly, by way of apology, made the common salute\r\nof the country by taking off their hats. Where would one of the lower or\r\nhigher classes in Europe have shown such feeling politeness to a poor\r\nand miserable object of a degraded race?\"--_Darwin's Naturalist's\r\nVoyage._]\r\n\r\nRudeness, which some Northerners fancy is a proof of equality and\r\nindependence, we never met with, and duels and street quarrels are\r\nalmost unknown. We detected none of the touchy sensitiveness of the\r\npunctilious Spanish _hidalgos_. Their compliments and promises are\r\nwithout end; and, made in the magnificent and ceremonious language of\r\nSpain,[24] are overwhelming to a stranger. Thus a fair Quitonian sends\r\nby her servant the following message to another lady: \"Go to the\r\nSeñorita Fulana de Tal, and tell her that she is my heart and the dear\r\nlittle friend of my soul; tell her that I am dying for not having seen\r\nher, and ask her why she does not come to see me; tell her that I have\r\nbeen waiting for her more than a week, and that I send her my best\r\nrespects and considerations; and ask her how she is, and how her husband\r\nis, and how her children are, and whether they are all well in the\r\nfamily; and tell her she is my little love, and ask her whether she will\r\nbe kind enough to send me that pattern which she promised me the other\r\nday.\"[25] This highly important message the servant delivers like a\r\nparrot, not omitting a single compliment, but rather adding thereto.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The Spanish tongue is the manly son of the Latin, as the\r\nItalian is the fair daughter; a language in which, as Charles V. said,\r\n\"God ought alone to be addressed in prayer.\" It is spoken in America\r\nwith an Andalusian rather than Toledan pronunciation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: We are indebted to Mr. Hassaurek for this capital\r\nillustration. Every lady, married or unmarried, is addressed _Señorita_,\r\nor Miss.]\r\n\r\nA newly-arrived foreigner is covered with promises: houses, horses,\r\nservants, yea, every thing is at his disposal. But, alas! the traveler\r\nsoon finds that this ceremony of words does not extend to deeds. He is\r\nnever expected to call for the services so pompously proffered. So long\r\nas he stays in Quito he will not lose sight of the contrast between big\r\npromise and beggarly performance. This outward civility, however, is not\r\nhypocritical; it is mere mechanical prattle; the speaker does not expect\r\nto be taken at his word. The love of superlatives and the want of good\r\nfaith may be considered as prominent characteristics. \"The readiness\r\nwith which they break a promise or an agreement (wrote Colonel Hall\r\nforty years ago) can only be equaled by the sophistical ingenuity with\r\nwhich they defend themselves for having done so.\" The Quitonians, who\r\nare sensible of their shortcomings, have this standing apology: \"Our\r\nvices we owe to Spain; our virtues to ourselves.\"[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: \"When speaking of these countries, the manner in which\r\nthey have been brought up by their unnatural parent, Spain, should\r\nalways be borne in mind. On the whole, perhaps, more credit is due for\r\nwhat has been done, than blame for that which may be\r\ndeficient.\"--_Darwin's Journal of Researches_, p. 158.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the mutual distrust, partnerships are almost unknown; we do not\r\nremember a single commercial firm, save a few made up of brothers, or\r\nfather and son. With this moral debility is joined the procrastinating\r\nspirit of the oriental. _Mañana_ (to-morrow), like the _Boukra_ of the\r\nArabs, is the universal winding up of promises. And very often, if one\r\npromises a thing to-morrow, he means the day after that. It is\r\nimpossible to start a man into prompt compliance; he will not commence a\r\npiece of work when you wish nor when he promises. No amount of cajolery,\r\nbribery, or threats will induce a Quitonian to do any thing or be any\r\nwhere in season. If there were a railroad in Ecuador, every body would\r\nbe too late for the first train. There are only one or two watch-tinkers\r\nin the great city, and, as may be inferred, very few watches are in\r\nrunning order. As a consequence, the people have very little idea of\r\ntime. But this is not the sole reason for their dilatoriness; they are\r\nindifferent. Nobody seems to want to make money (though all are in sad\r\nneed of it); nobody is in a hurry; nobody is busy save the tailors, who\r\nmanifest a commendable diligence. Contempt for labor, a Spanish\r\ninheritance, and lack of energy, are traits which stand out in _alto\r\nrelievo_.\r\n\r\nOne can form his own judgment of the spiritless people from the single\r\nstatement which we have from Dr. Jameson, that during the last forty\r\nyears not ten Quitonians have visited the grand crater of Pichincha,\r\nthough it is possible to ride horseback to its very edge. Plenty of\r\ngentlemen by profession walk the streets and cathedral terrace, proud as\r\na Roman senator under his toga, yet not ashamed to beg a cup of coffee\r\nat the door of a more fortunate fellow-citizen. Society is in a constant\r\nstruggle between ostentation and want.\r\n\r\nNature has done more for Ecuador than for Ecuadorians. She laid out this\r\nbeautiful valley for an Elysian field; \"de Quito al Cielo\" (from Quito\r\nto Heaven) is not an empty adage; and it is painful to look upon\r\ntottering walls and impassable roads, upon neglected fields and an idle\r\npopulation--poor as poverty in the lap of boundless natural wealth. The\r\nonly really live man in the republic is the president, Señor G. Garcia\r\nMoreno, a man of wide views and great energy, standing in these respects\r\nhead and shoulders above his fellow-citizens. Quito and Quito Valley owe\r\nnearly all their improvements to this one man.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to say what would be the industry of a people who spend much\r\nof their time repeating traditions of treasures buried by the Incas, and\r\nstories of gold deposits in the mountains. Of commerce there is scarcely\r\nenough to deserve the name. Quito is an ecclesiastical city, and is\r\nnearly supported by Guayaquil. Without capital, without energy, without\r\nbusiness habits, Quitonians never embark in grand commercial schemes\r\nand industrial enterprises. There is not a highway for commerce in any\r\ndirection, only a natural path (called by the innocent natives a road),\r\nwhich rises to the altitude of fourteen thousand feet, by which the\r\nbeasts of burden pick their way over the Cordillera. And this is open\r\nonly six months in the year. Should a box designed for Quito arrive at\r\nGuayaquil at the beginning of the rainy season, it must tarry half a\r\nyear till _Nature_ makes the road passable.\r\n\r\nThe unstable condition of the country does not encourage great\r\nundertakings; all business is periodically paralyzed by revolution.\r\nMerchants generally buy their goods in Lima, to which city and Guayaquil\r\nthe fabrics of England and France are brought by foreigners in foreign\r\nships. The shops of Quito, as we have remarked, are very small, without\r\nwindows, and with only one wooden door. The door is double, and is\r\nfastened by a ponderous padlock. They are open from 7 A.M. till sunset,\r\nexcepting between nine and ten and between three and four, when the\r\nstores are closed for breakfast and dinner; the merchants never trusting\r\ntheir clerks, even when they have any, which is not usually the case.\r\nThey have no fixed price, but get what they can. The majority know\r\nnothing of wholesale, and refuse to sell by the quantity, fearing a\r\ncheat. An Indian woman will sell you a real's worth of oranges any\r\nnumber of times, but she would object to parting with a dollar's\r\nworth--her arithmetic can not comprehend it.\r\n\r\nIn the _portals_ or arcades of the Aguirre mansion and the nuncio's\r\npalace are the stalls of the haberdashers. Articles are not wrapped in\r\npaper; customers must get them home the best way they can. Ladies of the\r\nhigher class seldom go out shopping, but send for samples. It is\r\nconsidered disgraceful to either sex to be seen carrying any thing\r\nthrough the streets of Quito. The common people buy only for immediate\r\nwants--a dose of medicine, or a handful of potatoes at a time. Nearly\r\nall liquids, kerosene as well as wine, are sold by the bottle.\r\n\r\nThere was no bank in Quito in 1867, but an attempt has just been made to\r\nestablish one. The paper money of Guayaquil is often at nine per cent.\r\ndiscount in the capital. The currency is silver adulterated with one\r\nthird of copper. The smallest coin, the calé, is worth about two and a\r\nhalf cents. Above that are medios (five cents), reals (ten cents), two,\r\nfour, and eight reals. Eight reals make a soft dollar ($0 80); ten\r\nreals, a hard dollar ($1 00). There is no copper coin--oranges and\r\nloaves of bread are sometimes used to make change; and nearly all the\r\ngold in circulation are New Granada _condors_ and Peruvian _onzas_. Many\r\nof the silver pieces have large holes cut in the centre, so that they\r\nresemble rings. Government set the example (and the people followed) on\r\nthe plea that it would prevent the exportation of coin. The plan has\r\nsucceeded, for it does not pass out of the valley.\r\n\r\nNearly the only sign of progress is the late introduction of the grape\r\nand silk-worm; and these give so much promise of success that the\r\nthreadbare nobility have already begun to count their coming fortunes.\r\nHusbandry is more pastoral than agricultural. Thousands of cattle are\r\nraised on the paramos, but almost wholly for beef. \"A dislike to milk\r\n(observes Humboldt), or at least the absence of its use before the\r\narrival of Europeans, was, generally speaking, a feature common to all\r\nnations of the New Continent, as likewise to the inhabitants of China.\"\r\nSome cheese (mostly unpressed curd) and a little butter are made, but in\r\nthe patriarchal style. Only one American churn is in operation; the\r\npeople insist upon first boiling the milk and then stirring with a\r\nspoon. Custom is omnipotent here, and its effects hereditary. Milking is\r\ndone at any hour of the day, or whenever milk is wanted. The operation\r\nis a formidable one to these bull-fighting people. Stopping at a\r\nhacienda near Peliléo for a drink of milk, we were eye-witness of a\r\ncomical sight. A mild-looking cow was driven up to the door; the woman,\r\nevidently the bravest member of the household, seized the beast by the\r\nhorns; a boy tied the hind legs with a long rope, and held on to one end\r\nof it at a respectful distance; while the father, with outstretched\r\narms, milked into a calabash.\r\n\r\nAgricultural machinery is not in use. The first threshing-machine Quito\r\never saw was made in 1867 by some California miners, but it remained\r\nunsold when we last saw it. The spade is not known; the nearest approach\r\nto it is a crowbar flattened at one end. Hoes are clumsy and awkward.\r\nYankee plows are bought more as curiosities than for use. Many a crooked\r\nstick is seen scratching the land, as in Egypt, which the cattle drag by\r\ntheir horns. Sometimes a number of sharp-nosed hogs are tied together\r\nand let into a field, and driven from place to place till the whole is\r\nrooted up. Corn is planted by making holes in the ground with a stick,\r\nand dropping in the seed. The soil and climate of Ecuador, so infinitely\r\nvaried, offer a home to almost every useful plant. The productions of\r\neither India could be naturalized on the lowlands, while the highlands\r\nwould welcome the grains and fruits of Europe. But intertropical people\r\ndo not subdue nature like the civilized men of the North; they only pick\r\nup a livelihood.\r\n\r\nSpanish Americans, like Castilians on the banks of the Tagus, have a\r\nsingular antipathy to trees. When Garcia Moreno made a park of the dusty\r\nPlaza Mayor, he was ridiculed, even threatened. To plant a fruit or\r\nshade tree (a thing of foresight and forethought for others) in a land\r\nwhere people live for self, and from hand to mouth, is considered\r\ndownright folly in theory and practice. A large portion of the valley,\r\nleft treeless, is becoming less favorable for cultivation.\r\n\r\nYet, as it is, the traveler is charmed by the emerald verdure of the\r\ncoast, and by \"evergreen Quito\"--more beautiful than the hanging gardens\r\nof Babylon--suspended far above the ordinary elevation of the clouds. In\r\nthe San Francisco market we find wheat, barley, maize, beans, peas,\r\npotatoes, cabbages, beets, salads, pine-apples, chirimoyas, guavas,\r\noranges, lemons, pears, quinces, peaches, apricots, melons, and\r\nstrawberries--the last all the year round. Most of these are exotics;\r\nthe early discoverers found not a cereal grain of the Old World, not an\r\norange or apple, no sugar-cane or strawberries.[27]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The vase is still shown in which Father Rixi brought the\r\nfirst wheat from Europe. It was sown in what is now the San Francisco\r\nPlaza, the chief market-place of the city.]\r\n\r\nThere is but little manufacturing industry in the interior of Ecuador,\r\nbut much more than on the coast. The chief articles manufactured are\r\nstraw hats, shoes, baskets, carpets, embroidery, tape, thread, ponchos,\r\ncoarse woolen and cotton cloth, saddles, sandals, soap, sugar, cigars,\r\naguardiente, powder, sweetmeats, carved images, paints, and pottery.\r\nWines, crockery, glassware, cutlery, silks, and fine cloth are imported.\r\nThere are three cotton mills in the country; one in Chillo (established\r\nby Señors Aguirre in 1842), another in Otovalo (built by Señor Parija in\r\n1859), and a third in Cuenca (1861). The machinery of the Chillo factory\r\ncame from England; that of Otovalo from Patterson, N.J. The latter was\r\nutterly destroyed in the late great earthquake, and the proprietor\r\nkilled. The cotton is inferior to that of New Orleans; it is not \"fat,\"\r\nas mechanics say; the seeds yield only two per cent. of oil. But it is\r\nwhiter than American cotton, though coarse, and can be used only for\r\nvery ordinary fabrics. The average length is five eighths of an inch.\r\nOne pod will produce on an average three pennyweights. The mills of\r\nChillo and Otovalo consume 425,000 pounds annually. The first sugar-mill\r\nwas erected by the Aguirres in 1840 at Nanegal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indian Dwellings.]\r\n\r\nQuito is more than a century behind this age of steam and lightning. To\r\nform an adequate idea of the mechanic and fine arts in that \"city of the\r\nkings,\" we must transport ourselves to the Saxon period of European\r\ncivilization. Both the material and the construction of the houses would\r\ncraze Sir Christopher Wren. With fine quarries close at hand, they must\r\nbuild with mud mixed with stones, or plastered on wattles, like the\r\nDruses of Mount Lebanon. Living on the equatorial line and on the\r\nmeridian so accurately measured by the highest mathematics of France and\r\nSpain, Quitonians must needs leave out every right angle or straight\r\nline in the walls, and every square beam and rafter. Except on the grand\r\nroad from Quito to Ambato, commenced by President Moreno, there is not a\r\nwheel-barrow to be seen; paving-stones, lime, brick, and dirt, are\r\nusually carried on human backs. Saint Crispin never had the fortitude to\r\ndo penance in the shoes of Quito, and the huge nails which enter into\r\nthe hoofs of the quadrupedants remind one of the Cyclops. There are not\r\nsix carts in Quito. If you wish to move, you must coax a dozen Indians,\r\nwho care little for your money or your threats. Horse-hire, peonage, and\r\nmost mechanical work must be paid for in advance. Carriages--antique\r\nvehicles, of which there are two or three in the city--are drawn by\r\nmules. The first was introduced by Señor Aguirre so late as 1859, and he\r\nwas fined by the police for the privilege of riding in it. Quitonians\r\nare not a traveling people, and they are painfully ignorant of their own\r\ncountry. The most enterprising merchant ignores every thing but Quito\r\nand the road to Guayaquil.\r\n\r\nWe can not praise the musical talent of Spanish Americans; their\r\nintonation is too nasal, while in their jumpings and chirpings they take\r\nafter the grasshopper. A resident Englishman, who has traveled in many\r\ncountries, and sings the songs of nearly every nation, told us he could\r\nnot remember one of Ecuador. Pianos they have brought over the mountains\r\nat great expense; but they are more at home with the guitar. The\r\nembroidery and lace, wood carving and portrait painting of Quito, are\r\ncommendable; but the grandeur of the Andes, like the beauty of the Alps,\r\nwas never sketched by a native.\r\n\r\nEcuador boasts of one University and eleven colleges; yet the people are\r\nnot educated. Literature, science, philosophy, law, medicine, are only\r\nnames. Nearly all young gentlemen are doctors of something; but their\r\neducation is strangely dwarfed, defective, and distorted; and their\r\nknowledge, such as they have, is without power, as it is without\r\npractice. The University of Quito has two hundred and eighty-five\r\nstudents, of whom thirty-five are pursuing law, and eighteen medicine.\r\nThere are eleven professors. They receive no fees from the students, but\r\nan annual salary of $300. The library contains eleven thousand volumes,\r\nnearly all old Latin, Spanish, and French works. The cabinet is a bushel\r\nof stones cast into one corner of a lumber-room, covered with dust, and\r\ncrying out in vain for a man in the University to name them. The College\r\nof Tacunga has forty-five students; a fine chemical and philosophical\r\napparatus, but no one to handle it; and a set of rocks from Europe, but\r\nonly a handful from Ecuador. The College of Riobamba has four\r\nprofessors, and one hundred and twenty students. In the common schools,\r\nthe pupils study in concert aloud, Arab fashion. There are four papers\r\nin the republic; two in Guayaquil, one in Cuenca, and one in Quito. _El\r\nNacional_, of the capital, is an official organ, not a newspaper; it\r\ncontains fourteen duodecimo pages, and is published occasionally by the\r\nMinister of the Interior. Like the _Gazeta_ of Madrid, it is one of the\r\ngreatest satires ever deliberately published by any people on itself.\r\nThere is likewise but one paper in Cuzco, _El Triumfo del Pueblo_.\r\n\r\nThe amusements of Quito are few, and not very amusing. Indo-Castilian\r\nblood runs too slowly for merry-making. There are no operas or concerts,\r\nno theatres or lectures, no museums or menageries. For dramas they have\r\nrevolutions; for menageries, bull-baitings. A bull-bait is not a\r\nbull-fight. There is no coliseum or amphitheatre; no _matador_ gives the\r\nscientific death-wound. Unlike their fraternity in the ring of Seville,\r\nwhere they are doomed to die, the animals are only doomed to be\r\npothered; they are \"scotched, not killed.\" They are teased and tormented\r\nby yelling crowds, barking dogs, brass bands, red ponchos, tail-pulling,\r\nfire-crackers, wooden lances, and such like. The Plaza de Toros is the\r\nPlaza de San Francisco. This sport is reserved for the most notable\r\ndays in the calendar: Christmas, New Year's, Inauguration-day, and\r\nIndependence-day--the 10th of August.\r\n\r\nCock-fights come next in popularity, and are _bona fide_ fights. Often\r\nthe roosters are so heroic that both leave their blood in the arena, and\r\nnever crow again. Little knives are fastened to the natural spurs, with\r\nwhich the fowls cut each other up frightfully. The interesting scene\r\ntakes place on Sundays and Thursdays, near the Church of Santa Catalina,\r\nand is regulated by a municipal tribunal. The admission fee of five\r\ncents, and the tax of two per cent. on bets, yield the city a monthly\r\nrevenue of $100.\r\n\r\nOther pastimes are carnivals and masquerades. Carnival is observed by\r\npelting one another with eggs and sprinkling with water. Whoever\r\ninvented this prelude to Lent should be canonized. Masquerades occur\r\nduring the holidays, when all classes, in disguise or fancy dress, get\r\nup a little fun at each other's expense. The monotony of social life is\r\nmore frequently disturbed by fashionable funerals than by these\r\namusements; and, as the principal families are inter-related, the rules\r\nof condolence keep the best part of society in mourning, and the best\r\npianos and guitars silent for at least six months in the year.\r\n\r\nA word about the ladies of Quito. We concur in the remark of our\r\nminister, Mr. Hassaurek, that \"their natural dignity, gracefulness, and\r\npoliteness, their entire self-possession, their elegant but unaffected\r\nbearing, and the choiceness of their language, would enable them to make\r\na creditable appearance in any foreign drawing-room.\" Their natural\r\ntalents are of a high order; but we must add that the señoras are\r\nuneducated, and are incapable of either great vices or great virtues.\r\nTheir minds, like the soil of their native country, are fertile, but\r\nuncultivated; and their hearts, like the climate, are of a mean\r\ntemperature. Prayer-books and French novels (imported, as wanted, for\r\nthere is not a book-store in the city) are the alpha and the omega of\r\ntheir literature; Paris is considered the centre of civilization. They\r\nare comely, but not beautiful; Venus has given her girdle of fascination\r\nto few. Sensible of this, they paint.\r\n\r\nHolinski gives his impressions by contrasting the fair Quitonians with\r\nthe fairer Guayaquilians: \"Les yeux vifs et ardent, le pied fine et\r\nmignon, les teintes chaudes et dorées\" distinguish the latter. In the\r\nladies of the high capital there is nothing of this: \"Les yeux ne\r\nlancent pas de flammes, le pied est sans gentillesse, l'epiderme ne\r\nreflète pas les rayons du soleil.\" The ladies on the coast take all\r\npossible pains to preserve the small size of the foot; a large foot is\r\nheld in horror. Von Tschudi once overheard some ladies extolling in high\r\nterms the beauty of an English lady; all their praise, however, ending\r\nwith this exclamation, \"But what a foot! Good heavens! it is like a\r\ngreat boat!\" Gibbon is continually talking of beautiful señoras and\r\nseñoritas on the Andes; surely the lieutenant is in sport.[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: \"The young ladies of Cuzco are, in general, very\r\nbeautiful, with regular features, fresh olive complexions, bright eyes\r\nfull of intelligence, furnished with long lashes, and masses of black\r\nhair plaited in two tails.\"--_Markham_.]\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Quito give few entertainments for lack of ready money.\r\nThey spend much of their time in needle-work and gossip, sitting like\r\nTurkish sultanas on divans or the floor. They do not rise at your\r\nentrance or departure. They converse in a very loud, unmusical voice. We\r\nnever detected bashfulness in the street or parlor. They go to mass\r\nevery morning, and make visits of etiquette on Sundays. They take more\r\ninterest in political than in domestic affairs. Dust and cobwebs are\r\nunmistakable signs of indifference. Brooms are rarities; such as exist\r\nare besoms made of split stick. Since our return, we have sent to a\r\nQuitonian gentleman, by request, a package of broom-corn seed, which, we\r\ntrust, will be the forerunner of a harvest of brooms and cleaner floors\r\nin the high city. Not only the lords, but also the ladies, are\r\ninveterate smokers. Little mats are used for spittoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washerwomen.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps Quitonian ladies have too many Indian servants about them to\r\nkeep tidy; seven or eight is the average number for a family. These are\r\nmarried, and occupy the ground floor, which swarms with nude children.\r\nThey are cheap, thievish, lazy, and filthy. No class, pure-blood or\r\nhalf-breed, is given to ablution, though there are two public baths in\r\nthe city. Washerwomen repair to the Machángara, where they beat the\r\ndirty linen of Quito over the smooth rocks. We remember but two or\r\nthree table-cloths which entirely covered the table, and only one which\r\nwas clean. There are but two daily meals; one does not feel the need of\r\nmore; they are partaken at nine and three, or an hour earlier than in\r\nGuayaquil. When two unwashed, uncombed cooks bend over a charcoal fire,\r\nwhich is fanned by a third unkempt individual, and all three blinded by\r\nsmoke (for there is no chimney), so that it is not their fault if\r\ncapillaries and something worse are mingled with the stew, with onions\r\nto right of them, onions to left of them, onions in front of them, and\r\n_achote_ already in the pot in spite of your repeated anathemas and\r\nexpostulations--_achote_, the same red coloring matter which the wild\r\nIndians use for painting their bodies and dyeing their cloth--and with\r\nseveral aboriginal wee ones romping about the kitchen, keen must be the\r\nappetite that will take hold with alacrity as the dishes are brought on\r\nby the most slovenly waiter imagination can body forth.[29] The aim of\r\nEcuadorian cookery is to eradicate all natural flavor; you wouldn't know\r\nyou were eating chicken except by the bones. Even coffee and chocolate\r\nsomehow lose their fine Guayaquilian aroma in this high altitude, and\r\nthe very pies are stuffed with onions. But the beef, minus the garlic,\r\nis most excellent, and the _dulce_ unapproachable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: We noticed at Riobamba a custom which formerly prevailed\r\nalso at Quito. As soon as the guests have finished, and before they have\r\nrisen, the Indian waiter kneels devoutly down beside the table, and\r\noffers thanks in a very solemn, touching tone.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     Ecuador.--Extent.--Government.--Religion.--A Protestant Cemetery in\r\n     Quito.--Climate.--Regularity of Tropical Nature.--Diseases on the\r\n     Highlands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe republic of Ecuador looks like a wedge driven into the continent\r\nbetween the Marañon and the Putumayo. It has 1200 miles of Pacific\r\ncoast, and an area of about two hundred thousand square miles, including\r\nthe Galápagos Islands. Peru, however, claims the oriental half, drawing\r\nher northern boundary from Tumbez through Canélos and Archidona; and she\r\nis entitled to much of it, for she has established a regular line of\r\nsteamers on the Marañon, while the Quito government has not developed an\r\nacre east of the Andes. Ecuador is hung between and upon two\r\ncordilleras, which naturally divide it into three parts: the western\r\nslope, the Quitonian valley, and the Napo region. The fluvial system is\r\nmainly made up of the Napo, Pastassa, and Santiago, tributaries of the\r\nMarañon, and the Mira, Esmeraldas, and Guayaquil, flowing westward into\r\nthe Pacific. There are no lakes proper, but the natives enumerate\r\nfifty-five lagunes, the largest of which, Capucuy, is not over five\r\nmiles long.\r\n\r\nVillavicencio tells the world that his country has a total population of\r\n1,308,042. But Dr. Jameson believes it does not exceed 700,000. The\r\ngovernment is based on the Constitution of 1845, amended in 1853. The\r\npresident is chosen by a plurality of votes, holds his office for four\r\nyears, and has a salary of $12,000. He can not be re-elected,[30] nor\r\ncan he exercise his functions more than twenty-five miles from the\r\ncapital. But the law is often set aside by those in power. During the\r\nadministration of Garcia Moreno, prominent citizens were shot or\r\nbanished by his order, without trial by jury. To every plea for mercy\r\nthe stern president replied, that as he could not save the country\r\naccording to the Constitution, he should govern it according to his own\r\nviews of public necessity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Since this was written, Garcia Moreno has been re-elected\r\nto the presidency and the Constitution revised.]\r\n\r\nCongress assembles on the 15th of September every other year, and\r\nconsists of eighteen senators and thirty representatives. The chambers\r\nare small, and literally barren of ornament. The members sit in two rows\r\nfacing each other, have no desks, and give an affirmative vote by a\r\nsilent bow. Politics has less to do with principles and parties than\r\nwith personalities. Often it has a financial aspect; and the natural\r\nexpression on learning of a revolution is, \"Somebody is out of money.\"\r\nThe party in feathers its nest as fast as possible; there is scarcely a\r\npublic officer who is not open to bribery. The party out plots a\r\npremature resurrection to power by the ladders of corruption, slander,\r\nand revolution.[31] Revolution has so rapidly followed revolution that\r\nhistory has ceased to count them; and it may be said of them what Milton\r\nwrote of the wars of the Saxon Heptarchy, \"that they are not more worthy\r\nof being recorded than the skirmishes of crows and kites.\" The Grand\r\nPlaza, the heart where all the great arteries of circulation meet and\r\ndiverge, is where the high tides of Quito affairs ebb and flow.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Government has more than once paid its debts by\r\nrepudiation. Congress lately voted to pay only seven per cent. of the\r\nclaims against the state which are dated prior to a certain year. Among\r\nthe sufferers is the venerable Dr. Jameson, a distinguished foreigner,\r\nwho has served this country faithfully for forty years, first as\r\nassayer, then as director of the mint, and always by his scientific\r\nposition.]\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court consists of five judges. Criminal cases only are tried\r\nby jury; and an attorney is not permitted to question a witness. There\r\nare no penitentiaries: second-class criminals are made to work for the\r\npublic, while political offenders are banished to the banks of the Napo,\r\nor to Peru. Here, as in no other country, every man's house is his\r\ncastle. No search-warrants are allowed; a policeman can be shot dead on\r\nthe threshold. The person and property of a foreigner are safe; and no\r\nnative in the employ of a foreigner can be taken by the government for\r\nmilitary purposes. All, except pure Indians, can vote if over\r\ntwenty-one, and can read and write. A man's signature is without value\r\nif it lacks his flourish--a custom of Spanish origin.\r\n\r\nThe permanent army consists of two regiments. The soldiers are mostly\r\nhalf-breeds, and are generally followed by their wives. They are poorly\r\npaid; and as they are impressed into the service, they carry out the\r\nprinciple by helping themselves wherever they go. In marching, they have\r\na quicker step than Northern soldiers. The chief expenditure of the\r\nrepublic is for the army, about $500,000; the next is for the payment of\r\nthe national debt, $360,000. The foreign debt is £1,470,374. Ecuadorians\r\nclaim a revenue of a million and a half, of which one half is from the\r\ncustom-house, and one fiftieth from the post-office.\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that the people who breathe this high atmosphere, and\r\nenjoy this delightful climate, and are surrounded by all that is truly\r\ngrand and beautiful, would have some corresponding virtues. But we find\r\nthat Nature, here as every where, has mingled base and noble elements.\r\nThe lofty mountains, bearing in their steadfastness the seal of their\r\nappointed symbol--\"God's righteousness is like the great\r\nmountains\"--look down upon one of the lowest and most corrupt forms of\r\nrepublican government on earth;[32] their snowy summits preach sermons\r\non purity to Quitonian society, but in vain; and the great thoughts of\r\nGod written all over the Andes are unable to lift this proud capital out\r\nof the mud and mire of mediæval ignorance and superstition. The\r\nestablished religion is the narrowest and most intolerant form of\r\nRomanism. Mountains usually have a more elevating, religious influence\r\nthan monotonous plains. The Olympian mythology of the Greek was far\r\nsuperior to the beastly worship on the banks of the Nile. And yet at the\r\nvery feet of glorious Chimborazo and Pichincha we see a nation bowing\r\ndown to little images of the rudest sculpture with a devotion that\r\nreminds us of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Asking the late Chilian minister for his view of the rank\r\nof the different South American states, he gave us this order: Chile,\r\nBrazil, Argentine Republic, Venezuela, New Granada, Central America,\r\nMexico, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ecclesiastics.]\r\n\r\nThe belief is called _La Fe_, or the only true one. The oath of a\r\nProtestant is not regarded in courts of law. One fourth of Quito is\r\ncovered by convents and churches. The convents alone number fifty-seven,\r\nand are very extensive, sometimes spreading over eight or nine acres.\r\nThe Church revenue amounts to $800,000. There are more than four hundred\r\npriests, monks, and nuns in the capital. The native ecclesiastics are\r\nnotorious for their ignorance and immorality. \"It is a very common thing\r\n(says Dr. Terry) for a curate to have a whole flock of orphan nephews\r\nand nieces, the children of an imaginary brother.\" There is one\r\nex-president who has the reputation of tying a spur on the leg of a\r\ngame-cock better even than a curate. The imported Jesuits are the most\r\nintelligent and influential clergy. They control the universities and\r\ncolleges, and education generally. Active and intellectual, though not\r\nlearned, they have infused new life into the fat indolence of the\r\nSpanish system. Men of this world rather than the next, they have\r\nadopted a purely mundane policy, abjured the gloomy cowl, raised\r\ngorgeous temples, and say, \"He that cometh unto us shall in no wise lose\r\nheaven.\" Their chief merit, however, is the discovery of the turkey and\r\nquinine.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant in Quito is annoyed by an everlasting jingling of bells\r\nand blowing of bugles night and day. The latter are blown every third\r\nhour. The bells are struck by boys, not rung. A bishop, returning from a\r\nvisit to London, was asked if there were any good bells in England.\r\n\"Very fine,\" he replied, \"but there is not a man there who knows how to\r\nring them.\" Foreign machinery is sprinkled with holy water to neutralize\r\nthe inherent heresy; but a miller, for example, will charge more for his\r\nflour after the baptism.\r\n\r\nLotteries are countenanced by both Church and State, and in turn help\r\nsupport them; we saw one \"grand scheme\" carried out on the cathedral\r\nterrace and defended by bayonets.\r\n\r\nAt half past nine in the morning all Quito is on its knees, as the great\r\nbell of the cathedral announces the elevation of the Host. The effect is\r\nastonishing. Riders stop their horses; foot-passengers drop down on the\r\npavement; the cook lets go her dishes and the writer his pen; the\r\nmerchant lays aside his measure and the artisan his tool; the\r\nhalf-uttered oath (_carájo_!) dies on the lips of the Cholo; the arm of\r\nthe cruel Zambo, unmercifully beating his donkey, is paralyzed; and the\r\nsmart repartee of the lively donna is cut short. The solemn stillness\r\nlasts for a minute, when the bell tolls again, and all rise to work or\r\nplay. Holidays are frequent. Processions led by a crucifix or wooden\r\nimage are attractive sights in this dull city, simply because little\r\nelse is going on. Occasionally a girl richly dressed to represent the\r\nhumble mother of God is drawn about in a carriage, and once a year the\r\nfigures of the Virgin belonging to different churches are borne with\r\nmuch pomp to the Plaza, where they bow to each other like automatons.\r\n\r\n\"This is a bad country to live in, and a worse one to die in,\" said Dr.\r\nJameson. But times have changed, even in fossil Quito. Through the\r\nefforts of our late minister, Hon. W.T. Coggeshall, the bigoted\r\ngovernment has at last consented to inclose a quarter of an acre outside\r\nthe city for the subterranean burial of heretics. The cemetery is on the\r\nedge of the beautiful plain of Iñaquito, and on the right of the road\r\nleading to Guápolo. \"What a shame,\" said a Quitonian lady of position,\r\n\"that there should be a place to throw Protestant dogs!\"\r\n\r\nOn St. Nathaniel's day died Colonel Phineas Staunton, Vice-Chancellor of\r\nIngham University, New York. An artist by profession, and one of very\r\nhigh order, Colonel Staunton joined our expedition to sketch the glories\r\nof the Andes, but he fell a victim to the scourge of the lowlands one\r\nweek after his arrival in Quito. We buried him at noon-day[33] in the\r\nnew cemetery, \"wherein was never man laid,\" and by the act consecrated\r\nthe ground. Peace to his ashes; honor to his memory. That 8th of\r\nSeptember, 1867, was a new day in the annals of Quito. On that day the\r\nimperial city beheld, for the first time in three centuries, the decent\r\nburial of a Protestant in a Protestant cemetery. Somewhere, mingled with\r\nthe ashes of Pichincha, is the dust of Atahuallpa, who was buried in his\r\nbeloved Quito at his own request after his murder in Caxamarca. But\r\ndearer to us is that solitary grave; the earth is yet fresh that covers\r\nthe remains of one of nature's noblemen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: This was a new thing under the sun. Quitonians \"bury at\r\ndead of night, with lanterns dimly burning.\" The dirges sung as the\r\nprocession winds through the streets are extremely plaintive, and are\r\nthe most touching specimens of Ecuadorian music. The corpse, especially\r\nof a child, is often carried in a chair in a sitting posture. The\r\nwealthy class wall up their dead in niches on the side of Pichincha,\r\nhypothetically till the resurrection, but really for two years, when,\r\nunless an additional payment is made, the bones are thrown into a common\r\npit and the coffin burnt. To prevent this, a few who can afford it\r\nembalm the deceased. One of the most distinguished citizens of Quito\r\nkeeps his mummified father at his hacienda, and annually dresses him up\r\nin a new suit of clothes!]\r\n\r\nTurn we now to a more delightful topic than the politics and religion of\r\nQuito. The climate is perfect. Fair Italy, with her classic prestige and\r\nready access, will long be the land of promise to travelers expatriated\r\nin search of health. But if ever the ancients had reached this Andean\r\nvalley, they would have located here the Elysian Fields, or the seat of\r\n\"the blessed, the happy, and long-lived\" of Anacreon.[34] No torrid heat\r\nenervates the inhabitant of this favored spot; no icy breezes send him\r\nshivering to the fire. Nobody is sun-struck; nobody's buds are nipped by\r\nthe frost. Stoves and chimneys, starvation and epidemics, are unknown.\r\nIt is never either spring, summer, or autumn, but each day is a\r\ncombination of all three. The mean annual temperature of Quito is 58°.8,\r\nthe same as Madrid, or as the month of May in Paris. The average range\r\nin twenty-four hours is about 10°. The coldest hour is 6 A.M.; the\r\nwarmest between 2 and 3 P.M. The extremes in a year are 45° and 70°;\r\nthose of Moscow are-38° and 89°. It is a prevalent opinion that since\r\nthe great earthquake of 1797 the temperature has been lower. \"It was\r\nsuddenly reduced (says the _Encycl. Metropolitana_) from 66° or 68° to\r\n40° or 45°\"--a manifest error. The natives say that since the\r\n_terremote_ of 1859 the seasons have not commenced so regularly, nor are\r\nthey so well defined; there are more rainy days in summer than before.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether the late convulsion has affected the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: In the mountain-town of Caxamarca, farther south, there\r\nwere living in 1792 seven persons aged 114, 117, 121, 131, 132, 141, and\r\n147. One of them, when he died, left behind him eight hundred living\r\ndescendants to mourn his loss. We confess, however, that we saw very few\r\nold persons in Quito. Foreigners outlive the natives, because they live\r\na more regular and temperate life.]\r\n\r\nThe mean diurnal variation of the barometer is only .084. So regular is\r\nthe oscillation, as likewise the variations of the magnetic needle, that\r\nthe hour may be known within fifteen minutes by the barometer or\r\ncompass. Such is the clock-like order of Nature under the equator, that\r\neven the rains, the most irregular of all meteorological phenomena in\r\ntemperate zones, tell approximately the hour of the day. The winds, too,\r\nhave an orderly march--the ebb and flow of an aerial ocean. No wonder\r\nwatch-tinkers can not live where all the forces in nature keep time.\r\nNobody talks about the weather; conversation begins with benedictions or\r\ncompliments.\r\n\r\nThe greatest variations of the thermometer occur in autumn, and the\r\ngreatest quantity of rain falls in April.[35] While on the western side\r\nof the Andes, south of the equator, the dry season extends from June to\r\nJanuary, on the eastern side of the Cordillera the seasons are reversed,\r\nthe rain lasting from March to November. The climate of the central\r\nvalley is modified by this opposition of seasons on either side of it,\r\nas also by the proximity of snowy peaks. Nine such peaks stand around\r\nQuito within a circle of thirty miles. The prevailing winds in summer\r\nare from the northeast; in the winter the southwest predominate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35:\r\n\r\nThe mean annual fall of rain at Quito is 70 inches.\r\n     \"     \"     \"       \"      Charleston is 45.9 inches.\r\n     \"     \"     \"       \"      New York is 42.23     \"\r\n     \"     \"     \"       \"      Albany is 40.93       \"\r\n     \"     \"     \"       \"      Montreal is 36        \"\r\n     \"     \"     \"       \"      Madrid is 10.         \"\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are only three small drug-stores in the great city of Quito. The\r\nserpent is used as the badge of apothecary art. Physicians have no\r\noffices, nor do they, as a general rule, call upon their patients. When\r\nan invalid is not able to go to the doctor, he is expected to die.\r\nYellow fever, cholera, and consumption are unknown; while intermittent\r\nfevers, dysentery, and liver complaints, so prevalent on the coast, are\r\nuncommon. The ordinary diseases are catarrhal affections and typhoid\r\nfever. Cases of inflammation of the lungs are rare; more coughing may be\r\nheard during a Sunday service in a New England meeting-house than in six\r\nmonths in Quito. The diseases to which the monks of St. Bernard are\r\nliable are pulmonary, and the greater number become asthmatic. Asthma is\r\nalso common in Quito, while phthisis increases as we descend to the sea.\r\nIndividuals are often seen with a handkerchief about the jaws, or bits\r\nof plaster on the temples; these are afflicted with headache or\r\ntoothache, resulting from a gratified passion for sweetmeats, common to\r\nall ages and classes. Digestive disorders are somewhat frequent\r\n(contrary to the theory in Europe), but they spring from improper food\r\nand sedentary habits. The _cuisine_ of the country does not tempt the\r\nstomach to repletion, and the climate is decidedly peptic. So the\r\ntyphoid fever of Quito is due to filth, poor diet, and want of\r\nventilation. Corpulency, especially among the men, is astonishingly\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Lombard, mountain districts favor the development of\r\ndiseases of the heart; and contagious diseases are not arrested by the\r\natmosphere of lofty regions. This is true in Quito. But while nervous\r\ndiseases are rare in the inhabited highlands of Europe, in Quito they\r\nare common. Sleep is said to be more tranquil and refreshing, and the\r\ncirculation more regular at high altitudes; but our experience does not\r\nsustain this. Goître is quite common among the mountains. It is a sign\r\nof constitutional weakness, for the children of goîtred parents are\r\nusually deaf and dumb, and the succeeding generation idiots.\r\nBoussingault thinks it is owing to the lack of atmospheric air in the\r\nwater; but why is it nearly confined to the women? In the southern\r\nprovinces about Cuenca, cutaneous affections are quite frequent. In the\r\nhighlands generally, scrofulous diseases are more common than in the\r\nplains. There are three hospitals for lepers; one at Cuenca with two\r\nhundred patients, one at Quito with one hundred and twelve patients, and\r\none at Ambato. Near Riobamba is a community of dwarfs.\r\n\r\nD'Orbigny made a _post-mortem_ examination of some Indians from the\r\nhighest regions, and found the lungs of extraordinary dimensions, the\r\ncells larger and more in number. Hence the unnatural proportion of the\r\ntrunk, which is plainly out of harmony with the extremities. The\r\nexpanded chest of the mountaineers is evidently the result of larger\r\ninspirations to secure the requisite amount of oxygen, which is much\r\nless in a given space at Quito than on the coast. This is an instance,\r\nobserves Prichard, of long-continued habit, and the result of external\r\nagencies modifying the structure of the body, and with it the state of\r\nthe most important functions of life. We tried the experiment of burning\r\na candle one hour at Guayaquil, and another part of the same candle for\r\nthe same period at Quito. Temperature at Guayaquil, 80°; at Quito, 62°.\r\nThe loss at Guayaquil was 140 grains; at Quito, 114, or 26 grains less\r\nat the elevation of 9500 feet. Acoustics will also illustrate the\r\nthinness of the air. M. Godin found (1745) that a nine-pounder could not\r\nbe heard at the distance of 121,537 feet; and that an eight-pounder at\r\nParis, at the distance of 102,664 feet, was louder than a nine-pounder\r\nat Quito at the distance of 67,240 feet.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Archibald Smith, the power of muscular exertion in a\r\nnative of the coast is greatly increased by living at the height of\r\n10,000 feet. But it is also asserted by observing travelers that dogs\r\nand bulls lose their combativeness at 12,000 feet, and that hence there\r\ncan never be a good bull-fight or dog-fight on the Sierras. This is\r\nliterally true: the dogs seem to partake of the tameness of their\r\nmasters. Cats do not flourish at all in high altitudes; and probably the\r\nlion, transplanted from the low jungle to the table-lands, would lose\r\nmuch of his ferocity. Still, cock-fights seem to prosper; and the battle\r\nof Pichincha was fought on an elevation of nearly 11,000 feet. Bolivar\r\nand the Spaniards, also, fought like tigers on the high plain of\r\nJunin.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Gibbon states that the temperature of the blood of a young\r\nbull in Cuzco was 100°; air, 57°. At the base of the Andes a similar\r\nexperiment resulted in 101° for the blood, air 78°. The lieutenant\r\njocosely adds: \"The Spaniards have forced the hog so high up on the\r\nAndes that he suffers every time he raises his bristles, and dies out of\r\nplace.\"--Puna has been attributed to the presence of arsenical vapor.]\r\n\r\nThe sickness felt by some travelers at great elevations--violent\r\nheadache and disposition to vomit--is called _veta_; and the difficulty\r\nof breathing from the rarity of the air is termed _puna_. Gerard\r\ncomplained of severe headache and depression of spirits at the height of\r\n15,000 feet on the Himalayas; Dr. Barry, in ascending Mont Blanc (15,700\r\nfeet), speaks of great thirst, great dryness and constriction of skin,\r\nloss of appetite, difficult breathing, tendency to syncope, and utter\r\nindifference. Baron Müller, in his ascent of Orizava (17,800 feet),\r\nfound great difficulty in breathing, and experienced the sensation of a\r\nred-hot iron searing his lungs, and agonizing pains in the chest,\r\nfollowed by fainting-fits and torrents of blood from his mouth;\r\nHumboldt, in scaling Chimborazo, suffered from nausea akin to\r\nsea-sickness, and a flow of blood from the nose and lips; while Herndon,\r\non the slope of Puy-puy (15,700 feet), said he thought his heart would\r\nbreak from his breast with its violent agitation. Though ascending the\r\nAndes to the height of 16,000 feet, and running up the last few rods, we\r\nexperienced nothing of this except a temporary difficulty in\r\nrespiration. We were exhilarated rather than depressed. The experience\r\nof Darwin on the Portillo ridge (14,000 feet) was only \"a slight\r\ntightness across the head and chest.\" \"There was some imagination even\r\nin this (he adds); for, upon finding fossil shells on the highest ridge,\r\nI entirely forgot the puna in my delight.\" De Saussure says truly: \"The\r\nstrength is repaired as speedily as it has been exhausted. Merely a\r\ncessation of movement for three or four minutes, without even seating\r\none's self, seems to restore the strength so perfectly that, on resuming\r\nprogress, one feels able to climb at a single stretch to the very peak\r\nof the mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     Astronomic Virtues of Quito.--Flora and Fauna of the Valley of\r\n     Quito.--Primeval Inhabitants of the Andes.--Quichua Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuito, with a position unparalleled for astronomical purposes, has no\r\nobservatory. The largest telescope in the city is about five feet long,\r\nbut the astute professor of natural philosophy in the Jesuit College who\r\nhas charge of it had not the most distant idea that an eclipse of the\r\nsun would occur on the 29th of August, and an eclipse of the moon\r\nfifteen days later. In ancient days this \"holy city\" had within it the\r\nPillar of the Sun, which cast no shadow at noon, and a temple was built\r\nfor the god of light. The title of the sovereign Inca was the Child of\r\nthe Sun; but there was very little knowledge of astronomy, for, being\r\nthe national religion, it was beyond the reach of scientific\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Quito is of transparent clearness. Humboldt saw the\r\nponcho of a horseman with the naked eye at a horizontal distance of\r\nninety thousand feet. The sky is of a dark indigo color; the azure is\r\nless blended with white because of the extreme dryness of the air. The\r\nstars stand out with uncommon brilliancy, and the dark openings between\r\nthem the great German compared to \"tubes through which we look into the\r\nremotest depths of space.\" It is true at Quito, as Humboldt noticed at\r\nCumana, that the stars do not twinkle when they are more than fifteen\r\ndegrees high; \"the soft planetary light\" of the stars overhead is not\r\nmere rhetoric.\r\n\r\nLiving under the equatorial line, Quitonians enjoy the peculiar\r\nprivilege of beholding the stars of both hemispheres, the guiding stars\r\nof Ursa Major as well as the Magellanic Clouds and Southern Cross, not\r\nomitting that black spot near the latter, \"the unappropriated region in\r\nthe skies reserved by Manager Bingham for deposed American presidents.\"\r\n\r\nThe zodiacal light here appears in all its glory. This strange\r\nphenomenon has long puzzled philosophers, and they are still divided. It\r\nis generally considered to be produced by a continuous zone of\r\ninfinitesimal asteroids. The majority place this zone beyond the orbit\r\nof the earth, and concentric with the sun. But Rev. George Jones, of\r\nPhiladelphia, who has spent several years in observing this light,\r\nincluding eight months in Quito, considers it geocentric, and possibly\r\nsituated between the earth and its satellite. At New York only a short\r\npyramidal light, and this only at certain seasons, is to be seen; but\r\nhere, an arch twenty degrees wide, and of considerable intensity, shoots\r\nup to the zenith, and Mr. Jones affirms that a complete arch is visible\r\nat midnight when the ecliptic is at right angles to the spectator's\r\nhorizon. We have not been so fortunate as to see it pass the zenith; and\r\nProfessor Barnard contends that it never does pass. We may remark that\r\nthe main part of the zodiacal light shifts to the south side of the\r\ncelestial equator as we cross the line. To us the most magnificent sight\r\nin the tropical heavens is the \"Milky Way,\" especially near Sobieski's\r\nShield, where it is very luminous. We observed that this starry tract\r\ndivided at [Greek: a] Centauri, as Herschel says, and not at [Greek: b],\r\nas many maps and globes have it. The brightest stars in the southern\r\nhemisphere follow the direction of a great circle passing through\r\n[Greek: e] Orionis and [Greek: a] Crucis.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which arrests the attention of the traveler is the\r\ncomparatively well-defined boundary-line between day and night. The\r\ntwilight at Quito lasts only an hour and a half; on the coast it is\r\nstill shorter. Nor is there any \"harvest moon,\" the satellite rising\r\nwith nearly equal intervals of forty-eight minutes.\r\n\r\nFrom the stars we step down to the floral kingdom on the Andes, using as\r\nour ladder of descent the following sentence from Humboldt, at the age\r\nof seventy-five: \"If I might be allowed to abandon myself to the\r\nrecollections of my own distant travels, I would instance among the most\r\nstriking scenes of nature the calm sublimity of a tropical night, when\r\nthe stars--not sparkling, as in our Northern skies--shed their soft and\r\nplanetary light over the gently heaving ocean; or I would recall the\r\ndeep valleys of the Cordilleras, where the tall and slender palms pierce\r\nthe leafy veil around them, and wave on high their feathery and\r\narrow-like branches.\"\r\n\r\nFather Velasco praises Ecuador as \"the noblest portion of the New\r\nWorld.\" Nature has doubtless gifted it with capabilities unsurpassed by\r\nthose of any other country. Situated on the equinoctial line, and\r\nembracing within its limits some of the highest as well as lowest dry\r\nland on the globe, it presents every grade of climate, from the\r\nperpetual summer on the coast and in the Orient to the everlasting\r\nwinter of the Andean summits, while the high plateau between the\r\nCordilleras enjoys an eternal spring. The vegetable productions are\r\nconsequently most varied and prolific. Tropical, temperate, and arctic\r\nfruits and flowers are here found in profusion, or could be successfully\r\ncultivated. As the Ecuadorian sees all the constellations of the\r\nfirmament, so Nature surrounds him with representatives of every family\r\nof plants. There are places where the eye may embrace an entire zone,\r\nfor it may look up to a barley-field and potato-patch, and down to the\r\nsugar-cane and pine-apple.\r\n\r\nConfining our attention to the Quito Valley, we remark that the whole\r\nregion from Pichincha to Chimborazo is as treeless as Palestine. The\r\ndensest forest is near Baños. The most common tree is the \"Aliso\"\r\n(_Betula acuminata_). Walnut is the best timber. There are no pines or\r\noaks.[37] The slopes of the mountains, between twelve and fifteen\r\nthousand feet, are clothed with a shrub peculiar to the high altitudes\r\nof the Andes, called _Chuquiragua_. This is a very valuable shrub; the\r\ntwigs are used for fuel, and the yellow buds as a febrifuge. The\r\ncastor-oil-tree grows naturally by the road side, sometimes to the\r\nheight of twelve feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: On the Himalayas are oaks, birches, pines, chestnuts,\r\nmaples, junipers, and willows; no tree-ferns, bamboos, or palms.]\r\n\r\nA very useful as well as the most ordinary plant in the valley is the\r\nAmerican aloe, or \"Century Plant.\"[38] It is the largest of all herbs.\r\nNot naturally social, it imparts a melancholy character to the landscape\r\nas it rises solitary out of the arid plain. Most of the roads are fenced\r\nwith aloe hedges. While the majority of tropical trees have naked stems\r\nwith a crown of leaves on the top, the aloe reverses this, and looks\r\nlike a great chandelier as its tall peduncle, bearing greenish-yellow\r\nflowers, rises out of a graceful cluster of long, thick, fleshy leaves.\r\nWhen cultivated, the aloe flowers in much less time than a century; but,\r\nexhausted by the efflorescence, it soon dies. Nearly every part serves\r\nsome purpose; the broad leaves are used by the poorer class instead of\r\npaper in writing, or for thatching their huts; sirup flows out of the\r\nleaves when tapped, and, as they contain much alkali, a soap (which\r\nlathers with salt water as well as fresh) is also manufactured from\r\nthem; the flowers make excellent pickles; the flower-stalk is used in\r\nbuilding; the pith of the stem is used by barbers for sharpening razors;\r\nthe fibres of the leaves and the roots are woven into sandals and sacks;\r\nand the sharp spines are used as needles. A species of yucca, resembling\r\nthe aloe, but with more slender leaves and of a lighter green, yields\r\nthe hemp of Ecuador.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: The _Agava Americana_ of botanists, _cabulla_ of\r\nEcuadorians, _maguey_ of Venezuelans, and _metl_ of Mexicans. It is an\r\ninteresting fact, brought to light by the researches of Carl Neuman,\r\nthat the Chinese in the fifth century passed over to America by way of\r\nthe Aleutian Islands, and penetrated as far south as Mexico, which they\r\ncalled the land of _fusung_, that being the celestial name of the aloe.\r\nTerzozomoc, the high-priest of the ancient Mexicans, gave aloe leaves,\r\ninscribed with sacred characters, to persons who had to journey among\r\nthe volcanoes, to protect them from injury.]\r\n\r\nThe \"crack fruit\" of Quito, and, in fact, of South America, is the\r\nchirimoya.[39] Its taste is a happy mixture of sweetness and acidity.\r\nHanke calls it \"a masterwork of Nature,\" and Markham pronounces it \"a\r\nspiritualized strawberry.\" It grows on a tree about fifteen feet high,\r\nhaving a broad, flat top, and very fragrant flowers. The ripe fruit,\r\noften attaining in Peru the weight of sixteen pounds, has a thick green\r\nskin, and a snow-white pulp containing about seventy black seeds. Other\r\npomological productions are alligator pears, guavas, guayavas,\r\ngranadillas, cherries (a small black variety), peaches (very poor),\r\npears (equally bad), plums, quinces, lemons, oranges (not native),\r\nblackberries, and strawberries (large, but flavorless).[40] The\r\ncultivation of the grape has just commenced. Of vegetables there are\r\nonions (in cookery, \"the first, and last, and midst, and without end\"),\r\nbeets, carrots, asparagus, lettuce, cabbages, turnips, tomatoes\r\n(indigenous, but inferior to ours), potatoes (also indigenous, but much\r\nsmaller than their descendants),[41] red peppers, peas (always picked\r\nripe, while green ones are imported from France!), beans, melons,\r\nsquashes, and mushrooms. The last are eaten to a limited extent; Terra\r\ndel Fuego, says Darwin, is the only country in the world where a\r\ncryptogamic plant affords a staple article of food.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Bollaert derives the name from _chiri_ (cold) and _muhu_\r\n(seed).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Dr. Jameson has found the following species of _Rubus_ in\r\nthe valley of Quito: _macrocarpus_, _stipularis_, _glabratus_,\r\n_compactus_, _glaucus_, _rosæflorus_, _loxensis_, _urticæfolius_,\r\n_floribundus_, and _nubigenus_. The common strawberry, _Fragaria\r\nvesca_, grows in the valley, as also the _Chilensis_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Lieutenant Gilliss praises the potatoes of Peru, but we\r\nsaw no specimens in Ecuador worthy of note. The \"Irish potato\" is a\r\nnative of the Andes. It was unknown to the early Mexicans. It grows as\r\nfar south on this continent as lat. 50°. The Spaniards carried the\r\npotato to Europe from Quito early in the sixteenth century. From Spain\r\nit traveled to Italy, Belgium, and Germany. Sir Walter Raleigh imported\r\nsome from Virginia in 1586, and planted them on his estate near Cork,\r\nIreland. It is raised in Asiatic countries only where Europeans have\r\nsettled, and for their consumption. It is successfully grown in\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, where there is no native esculent farinaceous\r\nroot. Von Tschudi says there is no word in Quichua for potato. It is\r\ncalled _papa_ by the Napos.]\r\n\r\nThe most important grains are barley, red wheat, and corn, with short\r\nears, and elongated kernels of divers colors. Near the coast three crops\r\nof corn a year are obtained; at Quito it is of slower growth, but\r\nfuller. The sugar-cane is grown sparingly in the valley, but chiefly on\r\nthe Pacific coast. Its home is Polynesia. Quito consumes about one\r\nhundred and fifty barrels of flour daily. The best sells for four\r\ndollars a quintal. The common fodder for cattle is alfalfa, an imported\r\nlucerne. There is no clover except a wild, worthless, three-leaved\r\nspecies (_Trifolium amabile_). Nearly all in the above list are\r\ncultivated for home consumption only, and many valuable fruits and\r\nvegetables which would grow well are unknown to Quitonians. As Bates\r\nsays of the Brazilians, the incorrigible nonchalance and laziness of the\r\npeople alone prevent them from surrounding themselves with all the\r\nluxuries of a temperate as well as tropical country.\r\n\r\nIt would be an endless task to speak of the flowers. It must suffice to\r\nstate that a _Synopsis Plantarum Æquatoriensium_, the life-work of the\r\nvenerable Professor Jameson, of the University of Quito, has just been\r\npublished by the tardy government. Botanists will find in these two\r\nsmall volumes many new species unknown to American science, and others\r\nmore correctly described by one who has dwelt forty years among the\r\nAndes. The last zone of vegetation nearest the snow-line consists\r\nchiefly of yellow-flowering _Compositæ_. In fact, this family includes\r\none fourth of the plants in the immediate vicinity of Quito. The next\r\nmost numerous family is the _Labiatæ_, and then follow _Leguminosæ_ and\r\n_Gentians_. Although the _Rosaceæ_ is represented, there is not one\r\nspecies of the genus _Rosa_ not even in the whole southern hemisphere.\r\nThe magnificent _Befaria_, found in the lower part of the valley, is\r\ncalled \"the Rose of the Andes.\" Fuchsias may be considered\r\ncharacteristic of South America, since they are so numerous; only one or\r\ntwo kinds occur in any other part of the world. Flowers are found in\r\nQuito all the year round, but the most favorable months are December and\r\nMay. Yellow is the predominating color. The higher the altitude, the\r\nbrighter the hues of any given species. Thus the _Gentiana sedifolia_ is\r\na small, light blue flower in the lowlands, but on the Assuay it has\r\nbright blue petals three times as large and sensitive. This accords with\r\nHerschel's statement: \"The chemical rays of the spectrum are powerfully\r\nabsorbed in passing through the atmosphere, and the effect of their\r\ngreater abundance aloft is shown in the superior brilliancy of color in\r\nthe flowers of Alpine regions.\"\r\n\r\nAmerica is plainly the continent of vegetation; and wherever the\r\nvegetable element predominates, the animal is subordinated. We must not\r\nlook, therefore, for a large amount or variety of animal life in the\r\nEcuadorian forests. Time was when colossal megatheroids, mastodons, and\r\nglyptodons browsed on the foliage of the Andes and the Amazon; but now\r\nthe terrestrial mammals of this tropical region are few and diminutive.\r\nThey are likewise old-fashioned, inferior in type as well as bulk to\r\nthose of the eastern hemisphere, for America was a finished continent\r\nlong before Europe. \"It seems most probable (says Darwin) that the North\r\nAmerican elephants, mastodons, horse, and hollow-horned ruminants\r\nmigrated, on land since submerged near Behring's Straits, from Siberia\r\ninto North America, and thence, on land since submerged in the West\r\nIndies, into South America, where for a time they mingled with the forms\r\ncharacteristic of that southern continent, and have since become\r\nextinct.\"[42] The rise of the Mexican table-land split up the New World\r\ninto two well-defined zoological provinces. A few species, as the puma,\r\npeccari, and opossum, have crossed the barrier; but South America is\r\ncharacterized by possessing a family of monkeys, the llama, tapir, many\r\npeculiar rodents, and several genera of edentates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Journal of Researches_, p. 132.]\r\n\r\nThe tapir, the largest native quadruped, is sometimes found on the\r\nmountains, but never descends into the Quito Valley. A link between the\r\nelephant and hog, its true home is in the lowlands. The tapir and\r\npeccari (also found on the Andean slopes) are the only indigenous\r\npachyderms in South America, while the llama[43] and deer (both\r\nabounding in the valley) are the only native ruminants; there is not one\r\nnative hollow-horned ruminant on the continent. The llama is the only\r\nnative domesticated animal; indeed, South America never furnished any\r\nother animal serviceable to man: the horse, ox, hog, and sheep (two,\r\nfour, and six-horned), are importations. Of these animals, which\r\nrendered such important aid in the early civilization of Asia and\r\nEurope, the genera even were unknown in South America four centuries\r\nago; and to-day pure Indians with difficulty acquire a taste for beef,\r\nmutton, and pork. The llama is still used as a beast of burden; but it\r\nseldom carries a quintal more than twelve miles a day. The black bear of\r\nthe Andes ascends as high as Mont Blanc, and is rarely found below three\r\nthousand five hundred feet. The puma, or maneless American lion, has an\r\nimmense range, both in latitude and altitude, being found from Oregon to\r\nthe Straits of Magellan, and nearly up to the limit of eternal snow. It\r\nis as cowardly as the jaguar of the lowlands is ferocious. It is a very\r\nsilent animal, uttering no cry even when wounded. Its flesh, which is\r\nvery white, and remarkably like veal in taste, is eaten in Patagonia.\r\nSquirrels, hares, bats (a small species), opossums, and a large\r\nguinea-pig (_Cuye del Monte_), are found in the neighborhood of Quito.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: The llama, or \"mountain-camel\" is a beautiful animal, with\r\nlong, slender neck and fine legs, a graceful carriage, pointed ears,\r\nsoft, restless eyes, and quivering lips. It has a gentle disposition;\r\nbut when angry it will spit, and when hurt will shed tears. We have seen\r\nspecimens entirely white; but it is generally dark brown, with patches\r\nof white. It requires very little food and drink. Since the introduction\r\nof horses, asses, and mules, the rearing of llamas has decreased. They\r\nare more common in Peru. The llama, guánaco, alpaca, and vicuña were\r\n\"the four sheep of the Incas:\" the first clothing the common people, the\r\nsecond the nobles, the third the royal governors, the fourth the Incas.\r\nThe price of sheep's wool in Quito was formerly four cents a pound; it\r\nis now twelve.]\r\n\r\nAs only about sixty species of birds are common to North and South\r\nAmerica, the traveler from the United States recognizes few ornithic\r\nforms in the Valley of Quito. Save the hummers, beautiful plumage is\r\nrare, as well as fine songsters. But the moment we descend the Eastern\r\nCordillera into the interior of the continent, we find the feathered\r\nrace in robes of richest colors. The exact cause of this brilliant\r\ncoloring in the tropics is still a problem. It can not be owing to\r\ngreater light and heat, for the birds of the Galápagos Islands, directly\r\nunder the equator, are dull.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Mr. Gould, however, holds that the difference of\r\ncoloration is due to the different degrees of exposure to the sun's\r\nrays, the brilliantly-colored species being inhabitants of the edges of\r\nthe forest. Birds from Ucayali, in the centre of the continent, are far\r\nmore splendid than those which represent them in countries nearer the\r\nsea, owing to the clearer atmosphere inland. But it is a fact, at least\r\nexceptional to this theory, that the \"Cock of the Rock\" (Rupicola) on\r\nthe western side of the Andes (Esmeraldas) is of a richer, deeper color\r\nthan the same species on the eastern slope (Napo). In keeping with Mr.\r\nGould's theory is the statement by Mr. Bates, that the most gaudy\r\nbutterflies (the males) flutter in the sunshine.]\r\n\r\nThe males, both of birds and butterflies, are the most gaudily dressed.\r\nIn the highlands the most prominent birds are the condor and the\r\nhumming-bird. These two extremes in size are found side by side on the\r\nsummit of Pichincha. The condor appears in its glory among the mountains\r\nof Quito. Its ordinary haunt is at the height of Etna. No other living\r\ncreature can remove at pleasure to so great a distance from the earth;\r\nand it seems to fly and respire as easily under the low barometric\r\npressure of thirteen inches as at the sea-shore. It can dart in an\r\ninstant from the dome of Chimborazo to the sultry coast of the Pacific.\r\nIt has not the kingly port of the eagle, and is a cowardly robber: a\r\ntrue vulture, it prefers the relish of putrescence and the flavor of\r\ndeath. It makes no nest, but lays two eggs on a jutting ledge of some\r\nprecipice, and fiercely defends them. The usual spread of wings is nine\r\nfeet. It does not live in pairs like the eagle, but feeds in flocks like\r\nits loathsome relative, the buzzard. It is said to live forty days\r\nwithout food in captivity, but at liberty it is very voracious. The\r\nusual method of capture is to kill an old mare (better than horse, the\r\nnatives say), and allow the bird to gorge himself, when he becomes so\r\nsluggish as to be easily lassoed. It is such a heavy sleeper, it is\r\npossible to take it from its roost. The evidences in favor of and\r\nagainst its acute smelling powers are singularly balanced. For reasons\r\nunknown, the condor does not range north of Darien, though it extends\r\nits empire through clouds and storms to the Straits of Magellan. In the\r\nInca language it was called _cuntur_, and was anciently an object of\r\nworship. The condor, gallinazo, turkey-buzzard, and caracara eagle (says\r\nDarwin) \"in their habits well supply the place of our carrion crows,\r\nmagpies, and ravens--a tribe of birds widely distributed over the rest\r\nof the world, but entirely absent in South America.\" The condor appears\r\non the gold coins of New Granada and Chile. Of _Trochilidæ_ there are\r\nhosts. The valley swarms with these \"winged jewels\" of varied hues, from\r\nthe emerald green of Pichincha to the white of Chimborazo. They build\r\nlong, purse-like nests by weaving together fine vegetable fibres and\r\nlichens, and thickly lining them with silk-cotton. In this delicate\r\ncradle, suspended from a branch, the female lays two eggs, which are\r\nhatched in about twelve days. The eggs are invariably white, with one\r\nexception, those of a species on the Upper Amazon, which are spotted.\r\nThe young have much shorter bills than their parents. The humming-bird\r\nis exclusively American: the nearest form in the Old World is the\r\nnectarinia, or sunbird. Other birds most commonly seen in the valley\r\nare: _Cyanocitta turcosa_ (Jay), _Poecilothraupis atrierissa_,\r\n_Pheuticus chrysogaster_, _Chlorospingus superciliaris_, _Buthraupis\r\nchloronata_, _Tanagra Darwini_, _Dubusia selysia_, _Buarremon\r\nlatinuchus_, and _B. assimilis_. The only geese in the valley are a few\r\nimported from Europe by Señor Aguirre, of Chillo, and these refuse to\r\npropagate.\r\n\r\nReptiles are so rare in the highlands the class can hardly be said to be\r\nrepresented. During a residence of nearly three months in the Quito\r\nValley we saw but one snake.[45] Nevertheless, we find the following\r\nsentence in such a respectable book as Bohn's Hand-book of Modern\r\nGeography: \"The inhabitants of Quito are dreadfully tormented by\r\nreptiles, which it is scarcely possible to keep out of the beds!\" Of\r\nfrogs there are not enough to get up a choir, and of fishes there is\r\nbut one solitary species, about a finger long.[46] The entomology of\r\nQuito is also brief, much to the satisfaction of travelers from the\r\ninsectiferous coast. Musquitoes and bedbugs do not seem to enjoy life at\r\nsuch an altitude, and jiggers[47] and flies are rare. Fleas, however,\r\nhave the hardihood to exist and bite in the summer months, and if you\r\nattend an Indian fair you will be likely to feel something \"gently o'er\r\nyou creeping.\" But fleas and lice are the only blood-thirsty animals, so\r\nthat the great Valley of Quito is an almost painless paradise. Of\r\nbeetles and butterflies there are a few species, the latter belonging\r\nfor the most part to the familiar North American genera _Pyrameis_ and\r\n_Colias_. At Vinces, on the coast, we found the pretty brown butterfly,\r\n_Anartia Jatrophæ_, which ranges from Texas to Brazil. A light-colored\r\ncoleopter is eaten roasted by the inhabitants. The cochineal is raised\r\nin the southern part of the valley, particularly in Guananda, at the\r\nfoot of Tunguragua, where the small, flat-leaved cactus (_Opuntia\r\ntuna_), on which, the insect feeds, is extensively cultivated. The male\r\nis winged, but the female is stationary, fixed to the cactus, and is of\r\na dark brown color. It takes seventy thousand to make a pound, which is\r\nsold in the valley for from sixty cents to $3. The best cochineal comes\r\nfrom Teneriffe, where it was introduced from Honduras in 1835. The\r\nsilk-worm is destined to work a revolution in the finances of Ecuador;\r\nQuito silk gained a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition. No bees are\r\nhived in the republic; the people seem to be content with treacle. The\r\nItalian species would undoubtedly thrive here. The bees of Ecuador, like\r\nall the bees of the New World, are inferior to those of the Old World.\r\nTheir cells are not perfectly hexagonal, and their stings are\r\nundeveloped. They are seldom seen feeding on flowers. Mollusca in the\r\nQuito Valley are not great in number or variety. They belong principally\r\nto the genera _Bulimus_, _Cyclostoma_, and _Helix_. The first is as\r\ncharacteristic of the Southern Continent as _Helix_ of the North and\r\n_Achatina_ of Africa.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _Herpetodryas carinatus_, which we observed also at\r\nGuayaquil and on the Marañon. We procured two or three species from the\r\nnatives, and several new forms from Pallatanga, on the west slope.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Antelopus lævis_ at Ambato, and _A. longirostris_, a new\r\nspecies from Antisana Hacienda, were the only frogs noticed. The little\r\nfish is _Pimelodes cyclopum_ (preñadilla of the Spaniards, _imba_ of the\r\nIndians), the same that was thrown out in the eruptions of Imbabura and\r\nCaraguairazo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: The jigger, chigoe, or nigua (_Pulex penetrans_ of\r\nscience) is a microscopic flea, that buries itself under the skin and\r\nlays a myriad eggs; the result is a painful tumor. Jiggers are almost\r\nconfined to sandy places.]\r\n\r\nFrom the animal creation we mount by a short step to the imbruted\r\nIndian. When and by whom the Andes were first peopled is a period of\r\ndarkness that lies beyond the domain of history. But geology and\r\narchæology are combining to prove that Sorata and Chimborazo have looked\r\ndown upon a civilization far more ancient than that of the Incas, and\r\nperhaps coeval with the flint-flakes of Cornwall, and the shell-mounds\r\nof Denmark. On the shores of Lake Titicaca are extensive ruins which\r\nantedate the advent of Manco Capac, and may be as venerable as the\r\nlake-dwellings of Geneva. Wilson has traced six terraces in going up\r\nfrom the sea through the province of Esmeraldas toward Quito; and\r\nunderneath the living forest, which is older than the Spanish invasion,\r\nmany gold, copper, and stone vestiges of a lost population were found.\r\nIn all cases these relics are situated below high-tide mark, in a bed of\r\nmarine sediment, from which he infers that this part of the country\r\nformerly stood higher above the sea. If this be true, vast must be the\r\nantiquity of these remains, for the upheaval and subsidence of the coast\r\nis exceedingly slow.\r\n\r\nPhilology can aid us little in determining the relations of the primeval\r\nQuitonians, for their language is nearly obscured by changes introduced\r\nby the Caras, and afterward by the Incas, who decreed that the Quichua,\r\nthe language of elegance and fashion three hundred years ago, should be\r\nthe universal tongue throughout the empire.[48] Quichua is to-day spoken\r\nfrom the equator to 28° S. (except by the Aymará people), or by nearly a\r\nmillion and a half. We found it used, corrupted, however, by Spanish, at\r\nthe month of the Napo. There are five dialects, of which the purest is\r\nspoken in Cuzco, and the most impure in Quito. The Indians of the\r\nnorthern valley are descendants of the ancient Quitus, modified by Cara\r\nand Peruvian blood. They have changed little since the invasion of\r\nPizarro. They remember their glory under the Incas, and when they steal\r\nany thing from a white man, they say they are not guilty of theft, as\r\nthey are only taking what originally belonged to them. Some see in their\r\nsacred care of Incarial relics a lingering hope to regain their\r\npolitical life. We noticed that the pure mountaineers, without a trace\r\nof Spanish adulteration, wore a black poncho underneath, and we were\r\ninformed by one well acquainted with their customs that this was in\r\nmourning for the Inca. We attended an Indian masquerade dance at\r\nMachachi, which seemed to have an historical meaning. It was performed\r\nin full view of that romantic mountain which bears the name of the last\r\ncaptain of Atahuallpa. There is a tradition that after the death of his\r\nchief, Rumiñagui burned the capital, and, retiring with his followers to\r\nthis cordillera, threw himself from the precipice. The masquerade at\r\nMachachi was evidently intended to keep alive the memory of the Incas.\r\nThree Indians, fantastically adorned with embroidered garments, plumed\r\nhead-dresses, and gold and silver tinsel, representing Atahuallpa and\r\nhis generals, danced to music of the rudest kind, one individual\r\npounding on a drum and blowing on a pipe at the same time. Before them\r\nwent three clowns, or _diablos_, with masks, fit caricatures of the\r\nSpaniards. Like all other Indian feasts, this ended in getting gradually\r\nand completely drunk. During the ceremony a troop of horsemen, gayly\r\ndressed, and headed by one in regimentals with a cocked hat, galloped\r\ntwice around the Plaza, throwing oranges at the people; after which\r\nthere was a bull-bait.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: \"History (says Prescott) furnishes few examples of more\r\nabsolute authority than such a revolution in the language of an empire\r\nat the bidding of a master.\" The pronunciation of Quichua requires a\r\nharsh, explosive utterance. Gibbon says the sound of it to him resembled\r\nWelsh or Irish; that of Aymará, English. The letters _b_, _d_, _f_, _g_,\r\nand _o_ are wanting in the ancient tongue of Quito; _p_ was afterward\r\nchanged to _b_, _t_ to _d_, _v_ to _f_, _c_ to _g_, and _u_ to _o_: thus\r\nChim-pu-razu is now Chimborazo. A few words bear a striking analogy to\r\ncorresponding Sanscrit words; as _Ynti_, the Inca for sun, and _Indra_,\r\nthe Hindoo god of the heavens.]\r\n\r\nThe features of the Quichuans have a peculiar cast, which resembles, in\r\nD'Orbigny's opinion, no other American but the Mexican, and some\r\nethnologists trace a striking similarity to the natives of Van Diemen's\r\nLand. They have an oblong head (longitudinally), somewhat compressed at\r\nthe sides and occiput; short and very slightly arched forehead;\r\nprominent, long, aquiline nose, with large nostrils; large mouth, but\r\nnot thick lips; beautiful enduring teeth; short chin, but not receding;\r\ncheek-bones not prominent; eyes horizontal, and never large; eyebrows\r\nlong; thick, straight, coarse, yet soft jet black hair; little or no\r\nbeard; a long, broad, deep, highly-arched chest; small hands and feet;\r\nshort stature, seldom reaching five feet, and the women still shorter; a\r\nmulatto color (olive-brown says D'Orbigny, bronze says Humboldt), and a\r\nsad, serious expression. Their broad chests and square shoulders remind\r\none of the gorilla; but we find that, unlike the anthropoid ape, they\r\nhave very weak arms; their strength lies in their backs and legs. They\r\nhave shrewdness and penetration, but lack independence and force. We\r\nnever heard one sing.[49] Always submissive to your face, taking off\r\nhis hat as he passes, and muttering, \"Blessed be the altar of God,\" he\r\nis nevertheless very slow to perform. Soured by long ill treatment, he\r\nwill hardly do any thing unless he is compelled. And he will do nothing\r\nwell unless he is treated as a slave. Treat him kindly, and you make him\r\na thief; whip him, and he will rise up to thank you and he your humble\r\nservant. A certain curate could never trust his Indian to carry\r\nimportant letters until he had given him twenty-five lashes. Servile and\r\ntimid, superstitious and indolent, the Quichuans have not half the\r\nspirit of our North American Indians. It has passed into a proverb that\r\n\"the Indian lives without shame, eats without repugnance, and dies\r\nwithout fear.\" Abject as they are, however, they are not wholly without\r\nwit. By a secret telegraph system, they will communicate between Quito\r\nand Riobamba in one hour. When there was a battle in Pasto, the Indians\r\nof Riobamba knew of it two hours after, though eighty leagues distant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Their favorite musical instrument is the _rondador_, a\r\nnumber of reeds of different lengths tied in a row. The \"plaintive\r\nnational songs\" which Markham heard at Cuzco are not sung in Ecuador.]\r\n\r\nThe civilization of South America three centuries ago was nearly\r\nconfined to this Andean family, though they had attained only to the\r\nbronze period. In the milder character of their ancient religion and\r\ngentleness of disposition they are strongly distinguished from the\r\nnations that encircled the vale of Anahuac, the centre of civilization\r\non the northern continent. But little of this former glory is now\r\napparent. The Incas reached an astronomical knowledge which astonished\r\nthe Spaniards, but the Quichuans of to-day count vaguely by moons and\r\nrains. Great is the contrast between the architecture of this century\r\nand that in the days of Huayna-Capac. There are few Incarial relics,\r\nhowever, in the Valley of Quito, for the Incas ruled there only half a\r\ncentury. The chief monuments are the tolas or mounds (mostly at\r\nCuenca), containing earthen vessels and bronze hatchets and earrings;\r\nthe _Inga-pirrca_, or oval fortress, and the _Intihuaicu_, or temple of\r\nthe sun, near Cañar; the _Inga-chungana_, a massive stone resembling a\r\nsofa, where the Inca reposed to enjoy the delightful prospect over the\r\nValley of Gulán; and remnants of causeways and roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     Geological History of South America.--Rise of the Andes.--Creation\r\n     of the Amazon.--Characteristic Features of the Continent.--Andean\r\n     Chain.--The Equatorial Volcanoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree cycles ago an island rose from the sea where now expands the vast\r\ncontinent of South America. It was the culminating point of the\r\nhighlands of Guiana. For ages this granite peak was the solo\r\nrepresentative of dry land in our hemisphere south of the Canada hills.\r\nIn process of time, a cluster of islands rose above the thermal waters.\r\nThey were the small beginnings of the future mountains of Brazil,\r\nholding in their laps the diamonds which now sparkle in the crown of Dom\r\nPedro II. Long protracted eons elapsed without adding a page to the\r\ngeology of South America. The Creator seems to have been busy elsewhere.\r\nDecorating the north with the gorgeous flora of the carboniferous\r\nperiod, till, in the language of Hugh Miller, \"to distant planets our\r\nearth must have shone with a green and delicate ray,\" he rubbed the\r\npicture out, and ushered in the hideous reptilian age, when monstrous\r\nsaurians, footed, paddled, and winged, were the lords of this lower\r\nworld. All the great mountain chains were at this time slumbering\r\nbeneath the ocean. The city of New York was sure of its site; but huge\r\ndinotheria wallowed in the mire where now stand the palaces of Paris,\r\nLondon, and Vienna.\r\n\r\nAt length the morning breaks upon the last day of creation, and the fiat\r\ngoes forth that the proud waves of the Pacific, which have so long\r\nwashed the table-lands of Guiana and Brazil, shall be stayed. Far away\r\ntoward the setting sun the white surf beats in long lines of foam\r\nagainst a low, winding archipelago--the western outline of the coming\r\ncontinent. Fierce is the fight for the mastery between sea and land,\r\nbetween the denuding power of the waves and the volcanic forces\r\nunderneath. But slowly--very slowly, yet surely--rises the long chain of\r\nislands by a double process; the submarine crust of the earth is\r\ncooling, and the rocks are folded up as it shrivels, while the molten\r\nmaterial within, pressed out through the crevices, overflows and helps\r\nto build up the sea-defiant wall. A man's life would be too short to\r\ncount even the centuries consumed in this operation. The coast of Peru\r\nhas risen eighty feet since it felt the tread of Pizarro: supposing the\r\nAndes to have risen at this rate uniformly and without interruption,\r\nseventy thousand years must have elapsed before they reached their\r\npresent altitude. But when we consider that, in fact, it was an\r\nintermittent movement--alternate upheaval and subsidence--we must add an\r\nunknown number of millennia.\r\n\r\nThree times the Andes sank hundreds of feet beneath the ocean level, and\r\nagain were slowly brought up to their present height. The suns of\r\nuncounted ages have risen and set upon these sculptured forms, though\r\ngeologically recent, casting the same line of shadows century after\r\ncentury. A long succession of brute races roamed over the mountains and\r\nplains of South America, and died out ages ere man was created. In those\r\npre-Adamite times, long before the Incas ruled, the mastodon and\r\nmegatherium, the horse and the tapir, dwelt in the high valley of Quito;\r\nyet all these passed away before the arrival of the aborigines: the wild\r\nhorses now feeding on the pampas of Buenos Ayres were imported from\r\nEurope three hundred and thirty-three years ago.[50]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: At Paita, the most western point of South America, there\r\nis a raised beach three hundred feet high. The basal slate and sandstone\r\nrocks, dipping S. of E., are covered by conglomerate, sand, and a\r\ngypseous formation, containing shells of living species. Additional to\r\nthose described by D'Orbigny we found here _Cerithium læviuscula_,\r\n_Ostrea gallus_, and _Ampullina Ortoni_, as determined by W.M. Gabb,\r\nEsq., of Philadelphia. Darwin found shells in Chile 1300 feet above the\r\nsea, covered with marine mud. President Loomis, of Lewisburg University,\r\nPa., informs the writer, that in 1853, after nearly a day's ride from\r\nIquique, he came to a former sea-beach. \"It furnished abundant specimens\r\nof _Patellæ_ and other shells, still perfect, and identical with others\r\nthat I had that morning obtained at Iquique with the living animal\r\ninhabiting them.\" This beach is elevated 2500 feet above the Pacific.\r\nThe same observer says that near Potosi there is one uninterrupted mass\r\nof lava, having a columnar structure, not less than one hundred miles in\r\nlength, fifty miles wide, and eight hundred feet thick. It overlies a\r\nbed of saliferous sandstone which has been worked for salt. Fifty feet\r\nwithin a mine, and in the undisturbed rock which forms its roof, the\r\ndoctor found fragments of dicotyledonous trees with the bark on,\r\nundecomposed, uncharred, and fibrous.]\r\n\r\nAnd now the Andes[51] stand complete in their present gigantic\r\nproportions, one of the grandest and most symmetrical mountain chains in\r\nthe world. Starting from the Land of Fire, it stretches northward and\r\nmounts upward until it enters the Isthmus of Panama, where it bows\r\ngracefully to either ocean, but soon resumes, under another name, its\r\nformer majesty, and loses its magnificence only where the trappers chase\r\nthe fur-bearing animals over the Arctic plains. Nowhere else does Nature\r\npresent such a continuous and lofty chain of mountains, unbroken for\r\neight thousand miles, save where it is rent asunder by the Magellanic\r\nStraits, and proudly tossing up a thousand pinnacles into the region of\r\neternal snow. Nowhere in the Old World do we see a single well-defined\r\nmountain chain, only a broad belt of mountainous country traversing the\r\nheart of the continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: The name Andes is often derived from _anta_, an old\r\nPeruvian word signifying metal. But Humboldt says: \"There are no means\r\nof interpreting it by connecting it with any signification or idea; if\r\nsuch connection exist, it is buried in the obscurity of the past.\"\r\nAccording to Col. Tod, the northern Hindoos apply the name Andes to the\r\nHimalayan Mountains.]\r\n\r\nThe moment the Andes arose, the great continental valley of the Amazon\r\nwas sketched out and moulded in its lap. The tidal waves of the Atlantic\r\nwere dashing against the Cordilleras, and a legion of rivulets were\r\nbusily plowing up the sides into deep ravines; the sediment produced by\r\nthis incessant wear and tear was carried eastward, and spread out\r\nstratum by stratum, till the shallow sea between the Andes and the\r\nislands of Guiana and Brazil was filled up with sand and clay. Huge\r\nglaciers (thinks Agassiz), afterward descending, moved over the inclined\r\nplane, and ground the loose rock to powder.[52] Eddies and currents,\r\nthrowing up sand-banks as they do now, gradually defined the limits of\r\nthe tributary streams, and directed them into one main trunk, which\r\nworked for itself a wide, deep bed, capable of containing its\r\naccumulated flood. Then and thus was created the Amazon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: On this point see Chapter XVII.]\r\n\r\nIn South America Nature has framed her works on a gigantic scale. Where\r\nelse combined do we see such a series of towering mountains, such a\r\nvolume of river-water, and such wide-spreading plains? We have no proper\r\nconception of Andine grandeur till we learn that the top of the tallest\r\nmountain in North America is nearly a mile beneath the untrodden dome of\r\nChimborazo; nor any just view of the vast dimensions of the Amazonian\r\nValley till we find that all the United States could be packed in it\r\nwithout touching its boundaries; nor any adequate idea of the Amazon\r\nitself till we ascertain that it drains a million square miles more than\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\nSouth America is a triangular continent, with its axis, the Andes, not\r\ncentral, as in Europe, but lying on its extreme western edge, and in\r\nharmony with the well-known law that the highest mountains and the\r\ngrandest volcanoes face the broadest ocean. The highlands of Brazil and\r\nGuiana have neither volcanic nor snow-clad peaks.[53] Like all the dry\r\nland which first appeared, these primitive mountains on the Atlantic\r\nborder trend east and west. The result of this position is a triple\r\nriver system--the Orinoco, Amazon, and La Plata, draining three immense\r\nplains--the llanos of Venezuela, the sylvas of Brazil, and the pampas of\r\nthe Argentine Republic. The continuity and extent of these vast\r\ndepressions are more remarkable even than the height and length of the\r\nmountain chains.[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: \"The interior plateau of Brazil (says Dr. Lund) is\r\ncomposed of horizontal strata of the transition period, which are\r\nnowhere covered with the secondary or tertiary formations.\" The highest\r\npoint in Brazil is 5755 feet. Darwin speaks of \"some ancient submarine\r\nvolcanic rocks (in the province of La Plata) worth mentioning, from\r\ntheir rarity on this eastern side of the continent.\" With the exception\r\nof the coast of Venezuela, the eastern system is little exposed to\r\nearthquakes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: These three plains constitute four fifths of all South\r\nAmerica east of the Andes. The west slope of the Ecuadorian Andes is\r\nabout 275 feet per mile; on the east it is 125 feet.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the characteristic features of South America; they are not\r\nrepeated in any other continent.[55] Not one feature could be changed\r\nwithout destroying those peculiarities of soil and climate which so\r\nremarkably distinguish South America. Its position on the equator places\r\nit in the path of the vapory trade winds, which continually sweep over\r\nit westward till they strike the Andes, which, like a great condenser,\r\nroll a thousand streams eastward again to feed the mighty Amazon. So\r\neffectual is that barrier, not a drop of moisture passes it, and the\r\ntrade wind is not felt again on the Pacific till you are one hundred\r\nand fifty miles from the coast. Were the Andes on the Atlantic side,\r\nSouth America would be turned into a vast Sahara. As it is, the interest\r\nwhich attaches to this continent, save a few relics of the Incas, is\r\nexclusively that of pure nature. Nowhere does Nature affect us more\r\ndeeply with the feeling of her grandeur; nowhere does she exhibit wilder\r\nfreaks or more startling contrasts; nowhere do we find such a theatre\r\nfor the free development of vegetable and animal life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: There is, however, a striking coincidence between the\r\nmountain and river systems of the northern and southern continents of\r\nthis hemisphere. Thus,\r\n\r\nThe Andes represent the Rocky Mountains,\r\n \"  Highland of Guiana represent the Canadian Mountains.\r\n \"     \"        Brazil     \"         Appalachian  \"\r\n \"              Amazon     \"         Saskatchewan.\r\n \"              La Plata   \"         Mississippi.\r\n \"              Orinoco    \"         Mackenzie.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe long and lofty chain of the Andes is certainly one of the grandest\r\nresults of the plications and uplifts of the earth's crust. While the\r\nwaves of the Pacific, from Panama to Patagonia, submissively kiss the\r\nfeet of the Andes, and the showers that swell the Amazon fall within\r\nsight of the mariner on that peaceful ocean, the Rocky Mountains are\r\nsituated five hundred miles from the sea. The space west of the Andes\r\ndoes not contain 20,000 square leagues, while the country east of it\r\nequals 424,600. While the compact Andes have an average width of only\r\nsixty miles,[56] the straggling mountain system beyond the Mississippi\r\nhas the breadth of the Empire State; but the mean elevation of the\r\nlatter would scarcely reach the bottom of the Quito Valley. The\r\nmountains of Asia may surpass the Cordilleras in height, but, situated\r\nbeyond the tropics, and destitute of volcanoes, they do not present that\r\ninexhaustible variety of phenomena which characterizes the latter. The\r\noutbursts of porphyry and trachytic domes, so characteristic of the high\r\ncrests of the Cordilleras, impart a physiognomy quite distinct from that\r\npresented by the mountains of Europe. The Andes offer, in the least\r\nspace, the greatest possible variety of impressions.[57] There is near\r\nHuanca, Peru, a coal-bed lifted up to the enormous height of 14,700\r\nfeet, and on the side of Chimborazo there is a salt spring 13,000 feet\r\nabove the sea. Marine shells have not been found in Europe above the\r\nsummit of the Pyrenees, or 11,700 feet; but the Andes can show some a\r\nthousand feet higher. A strange sight, to see shells once crawling on\r\nthe bottom of the ocean now resting at an elevation twice the height of\r\nMount Washington!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: The width of the chain south of the equator varies with\r\nthat of the continent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: \"No mountains which I have seen in Hungary, Saxony, or the\r\nPyrenees are as irregular as the Andes, or broken into such alternate\r\nsubstances, manifesting such prodigious revolutions of nature.\"--_Helms_.\r\n\"More sublime than the Alps by their _ensemble_, the Andes lack those\r\ncurious and charming details of which Nature has been so lavish in the\r\nold continent.\"--_Holinski_.]\r\n\r\nBeneath the Southern Cross, out of a sea perpetually swept by fearful\r\ngales, rise the rocky hills of Terra del Fuego. It is the starting-point\r\nof that granite chain which winds around the earth in a majestic curve,\r\nfirst northwesterly to the Arctic Sea, thence by the Aleutian and\r\nJapanese Isles to Asia, crossing the Old World southwesterly from China\r\nto South Africa.\r\n\r\nSkirting the bleak shores of Patagonia in a single narrow sierra, the\r\nAndes enter Chile, rising higher and higher till they culminate in the\r\ngigantic porphyritic peak of Aconcagua. At the boundary-line of Bolivia,\r\nthe chain, which has so far followed a precise meridional direction,\r\nturns to the northwest, and, at the same time, separates into two\r\nCordilleras, inclosing the great table-land of Desaguadero. This\r\nwonderful valley, the Thibet of the New World, has four times the area\r\nof New York State, and five times the elevation of the Catskill Mountain\r\nHouse. At one end of the valley, perched above the clouds, is silvery\r\nPotosi, the highest city in the world; at the other stands the once\r\ngolden capital of Cuzco. Between them is Lake Titicaca[58] (probably an\r\nancient crater), within which is an island celebrated as the cradle of\r\nthe strange empire of Peru, which, though crushed by Pizarro in its\r\nbudding civilization, ranks as the most extraordinary and extensive\r\nempire in the annals of American history. The Cordillera, of which\r\nSahama, Sorata, and Illimani are the pinnacles, so completely inclose\r\nthis high valley that not a drop of water can escape except by\r\nevaporation. At the silver mines of Pasco the Andes throw off a third\r\ncordillera, and with this triple arrangement and a lower altitude, enter\r\nthe republic of Ecuador. There they resume the double line, and surpass\r\ntheir former magnificence. Twenty volcanoes, presided over by the\r\nprincely Chimborazo and Cotopaxi, rise out of a sublime congregation of\r\nmountains surrounding the famous valley of Quito. In New Granada there\r\nis a final and unique display of Andine grandeur: the Cordilleras\r\ncombine just above the equator into one dizzy ridge, and then spread out\r\nlike a fan, or, rather, like the graceful branches of the palm. One\r\nsierra bends to the east, holding in its lap the city of Bogota, and,\r\nrolling off a thousand streams to swell the Orinoco, terminates in the\r\nbeautiful mountains of Caracas; the central range culminates in the\r\nvolcanic Tolima,[59] but is soon lost in the Caribbean Sea; the western\r\nchain turns to the left, humbling itself as it threads the narrow\r\nisthmus, and expands into the level table-land of Mexico. You may cross\r\nMexico from ocean to ocean in a carriage, but no wheeled vehicle ever\r\ncrossed South America.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: This lake is the largest fresh-water accumulation in South\r\nAmerica. It has diminished within the historic period. Its surface is\r\n12,795 feet above the Pacific, or higher than the highest peaks of the\r\nPyrenees.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: This is the loftiest summit of the Andes in the northern\r\nhemisphere, being 18,200 feet. It is also remarkable for being situated\r\nfarther from the sea (120 miles) than any other active volcano.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Profiles of Ecuadorian Volcanoes\r\n\r\n10,000 ft. Chimborazo.\r\n\r\n10,000 ft. Cotopaxi.\r\n\r\n10,000 ft. Caraguairazo.\r\n\r\n10,000 ft. Pichincha.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe will now speak more particularly of the Andes of the equator. The\r\nmountain chain is built up of granite, gneissoid, and schistose rocks,\r\noften in vertical position, and capped with trachyte and porphyry.[60]\r\nLarge masses of _solid_ rock are rarely seen; every thing is cracked,\r\ncalcined, or triturated. While in Bolivia the Eastern Cordillera shows a\r\nsuccession of sharp, ragged peaks, in contrast with the conical summits\r\nof the Cordillera of the coast, there is no such distinction in the\r\nAndes of the equator.[61] The Eastern Cordillera has a greater mean\r\nheight, and it displays more volcanic activity. Twenty volcanic\r\nmountains surround the valley, of which twelve are in the oriental\r\nchain. Three of the twenty are now active (Cotopaxi, Sangai, and\r\nPichincha), and five others are known to have erupted since the Conquest\r\n(Chiles, Imbabura, Guamani, Tunguragua, and Quirotoa). The truncated\r\ncone of Cotopaxi, the jagged, Alpine crest of ruined Altar, and the dome\r\nof Chimborazo, are the representative forms of the volcanic summits. The\r\nextinct volcanoes usually have double domes or peaks, while the active\r\npeaks are slender cones. Antisana and Cayambi are fashioned after\r\nChimborazo, though the latter is table-topped rather than convex;\r\nCaraguairazo, Quirotoa, Iliniza, Sincholagua, Rumiñagui, and Corazon,\r\nresemble Altar; Tunguragua, Sangai, Llanganati, Cotocachí, Chiles, and\r\nImbabura, imitate Cotopaxi; Pichincha, Atacatzo, and Guamani are\r\nirregular. The Ecuadorian volcanoes have rarely ejected liquid lava, but\r\nchiefly water, mud, ashes, and fragments of trachyte and porphyry.\r\nCotopaxi alone produces pure, foam-like pumice, and glossy,\r\ntranslucent obsidian.[62] The paucity of quartz, and the absence of\r\nbasalt, are remarkable. Some of the porphyroids are conglomerate, but\r\nthe majority are true porphyries, having a homogeneous base. Dr. T.\r\nSterry Hunt calls them porphyroid trachytes. They have a black, rarely\r\nreddish, vitreous, or impalpable base, approaching obsidian, with a\r\nspecific gravity of 2.59 in pure specimens, and holding crystals or\r\ncrystalline grains of glassy feldspar, and sometimes of pyroxene and\r\nhematite. They differ from the Old World porphyries in containing no\r\nquartz, and seldom mica.[63] D'Orbigny considers the porphyries of the\r\nAndes to have been ejected at the close of the cretaceous period, and\r\nformed the first relief of the Cordillera. The prevalence of trachyte\r\nshows that the products have cooled under feeble pressure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: \"As a general rule, whenever the mass of mountains rises\r\nmuch above the limit of perpetual snow, the primitive rocks disappear,\r\nand the summits are trachyte or trappean porphyry.\"--_Humboldt_. In\r\ngeneral, \"the great Cordilleras are formed of innumerable varieties of\r\ngranites, gneiss, schists, hornblende, chloritic slates, porphyries,\r\netc., and these rocks alternate with each other in meridional bands,\r\nwhich in the ridges frequently present the appearance of a radiated or\r\nfan-shaped structure, and under the plains are more or less\r\nvertical.\"--_Evan Hopkins, F.G.S_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Von Tschudi makes the incorrect statement that \"throughout\r\nthe whole extent of South America there is not a single instance of the\r\nWestern Cordillera being intersected by a river.\" Witness the\r\nEsmeraldas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: It is a singular fact that true trachyte, pumice, and\r\nobsidian are wanting in the volcanic Galápagos Islands, only 700 miles\r\nwest of Pichincha.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: As many of the crystals are partly fused, or have round\r\nangles, the porphyries were probably formed by the melting of a\r\ncrystalline rock, the base becoming fused into a homogeneous material,\r\nwhile the less fusible crystals remain imbedded.--_Dr. Hunt_.]\r\n\r\nFrom the deluges of water lately thrown out have resulted deep furrows\r\nin the sides; and from the prevalence of the east wind, which is always\r\nmet by the traveler on the crest of either Cordillera, there is a\r\ngreater accumulation of ashes, and less snow on the west slope. Cotopaxi\r\nis a fine example of this. In Pichincha, Altar, and Rumiñagua, however,\r\nthe western wall is lowest, apparently broken down.[64] There is no\r\nsynchronism in the eruptions of Cotopaxi and Pichincha. These volcanoes\r\nmust have independent reservoirs, for the former is 3000 feet higher\r\nthan the latter, and only thirty miles distant. The reputed eruptions of\r\nPichincha are dated 1534, 1539, 1566, 1575, 1588, and 1660; that of 1534\r\nresting on the assertions of Checa, Garcilazo, and Herrera, indorsed by\r\nHumboldt. Excepting the traditional eruption in 1534, which probably is\r\nconfounded with that of Pichincha, Cotopaxi did not open till 1742; then\r\nfollowed the eruptions of 1743, 1744, 1746, 1766, 1768, 1803, 1851, and\r\n1855. We must mention, however, that, since the recent awakening of\r\nPichincha, Cotopaxi has been unusually silent. There is also a\r\nremarkable coincidence (which may not be wholly accidental) in the\r\nrenewed activity of Pichincha, and the great eruption of Mauna Loa, both\r\noccurring in March, 1868. It is generally believed by the natives that\r\nCotopaxi and Tunguragua are sympathetic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: In the Galápagos volcanoes the south wall is lowest, while\r\nthe craters in Mexico and Sandwich Islands are lowest on the northeast.]\r\n\r\nThere are fifty-one volcanoes in the Andean chain. Of these, twenty\r\ngirdle the Valley of Quito, three active, five dormant, and twelve\r\nextinct.[65] Besides these are numerous mountain peaks not properly\r\nvolcanic. Nowhere on the face of the earth is there such a grand\r\nassemblage of mountains. Twenty-two summits are covered with perpetual\r\nsnow, and fifty are over ten thousand feet high.[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: The altitudes of the most important Ecuadorian volcanoes\r\nare:\r\n\r\nWESTERN CHAIN.\r\n_Chimborazo_, 21,420 feet (Humboldt).\r\n_Caraguairazo_, 19,183 feet (Humboldt).\r\n  It is variously estimated from 15,673\r\n  feet to 19,720 feet; 18,000 feet is\r\n  not far from the truth.\r\n_Iliniza_, 17,370 feet (Wisse); 16,300\r\n  (Hall).\r\n_Cotocachí_, 16,440 feet (Humboldt);\r\n  16,409 (Wisse).\r\n_Pichincha_, 15,922 feet (Humboldt);\r\n  15,827 (Orton).\r\n\r\nEASTERN CHAIN.\r\n_Cayambi_, 19,648 feet (Humboldt);\r\n  19,358 (Wisse).\r\n_Antisana_, 19,148 feet (Humboldt);\r\n  19,279 (Wisse).\r\n_Cotopaxi_, 18,880 feet (Humboldt);\r\n  18,862 (Wisse).\r\n_Altar_, 17,400 feet.\r\n_Sangai_, 17,120 feet (Wisse).\r\n_Tunguragua_, 16,579 feet (Humboldt).\r\n_Sincholagua_, 16,434 feet (Humboldt).\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The snow limit at the equator is 15,800 feet. No living\r\ncreature, save the condor, passes this limit; naked rocks, fogs, and\r\neternal snows mark the reign of uninterrupted solitude. The following is\r\nthe approximate limit of perpetual snow in different latitudes:\r\n\r\n 0°          15,800 feet.\r\n27°          18,800  \"\r\n33°          12,780  \"\r\n40°           8,300 feet.\r\n54°           3,700  \"\r\n70°           3,300  \"\r\n\r\nThe limit appears to descend more rapidly going south of the equator\r\nthan in going north.]\r\n\r\nAll of these would be visible from a single stand-point--the summit of\r\nCotopaxi. The lofty peaks shoot up with so much method as almost to\r\nprovoke the theory that the Incas, in the zenith of their power, planted\r\nthem as signal monuments along the royal road to Cuzco. The eastern\r\nseries is called the _Cordillera real_, because along its flank are the\r\nremnants of the splendid highway which once connected Quito and the\r\nPeruvian capital.[67] It can also boast of such tremendous volcanoes as\r\nCotopaxi and Sangai. The Western Cordillera contains but one active\r\nvolcano; but then it can point to peerless Chimborazo and the deep\r\ncrater of Pichincha. These twenty volcanic mountains rise within a space\r\nonly two hundred miles long and thirty miles wide. It makes one tremble\r\nto think of the awful crevice over which they are placed.[68]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: We traveled over a portion of this ancient road in going\r\nfrom Riobamba to Cajabamba. It is well paved with cut blocks of dark\r\nporphyry. It is not graded, but partakes of the irregularity of the\r\ncountry. Designed, not for carriages, but for troops and llamas, there\r\nare steps when the ascent is steep.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Grand as the Andes are, how insignificant in a general\r\nview! How slightly they cause our globe to differ from a perfect sphere!\r\nCotopaxi constitutes only 1/1100 of the earth's radius; and on a globe\r\nsix feet in diameter, Chimborazo would be represented by a grain of sand\r\nless than 1/20 of an inch in thickness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     The Volcanoes of Ecuador.--Western\r\n     Cordillera.--Chimborazo.--Iliniza.--Corazon.--Pichincha.--Descent\r\n     into its Crater.\r\n\r\n\r\nComing up from Peru through the cinchona forests of Loja, and over the\r\nbarren hills of Assuay, the traveler reaches Riobamba, seated on the\r\nthreshold of magnificence--like Damascus, an oasis in a sandy plain,\r\nbut, unlike the Queen of the East, surrounded with a splendid retinue of\r\nsnowy peaks that look like icebergs floating in a sea of clouds.\r\n\r\nOn our left is the most sublime spectacle in the New World. It is a\r\nmajestic pile of snow, its clear outline on the deep blue sky describing\r\nthe profile of a lion in repose. At noon the vertical sun, and the\r\nprofusion of light reflected from the glittering surface, will not allow\r\na shadow to be cast on any part, so that you can easily fancy the figure\r\nis cut out of a mountain of spotless marble. This is Chimborazo--yet not\r\nthe whole of it--you see but a third of the great giant. His feet are as\r\neternally green as his head is everlastingly white; but they are far\r\naway beneath the bananas and cocoa-palms of the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nRousseau was disappointed when he first saw the sea; and the first\r\nglimpse of Niagara often fails to meet one's expectations. But\r\nChimborazo is sure of a worshiper the moment its overwhelming grandeur\r\nbreaks upon the traveler. You feel that you are in the presence-chamber\r\nof the monarch of the Andes. There is sublimity in his kingly look, of\r\nwhich the ocean might be proud.\r\n\r\n    \"All that expands the spirit, yet appals,\r\n    Gathers around this summit, as if to show\r\n    How earth may pierce to heaven, yet leave vain man below.\"\r\n\r\nWell do we remember our disappointment as we stood before that wonder of\r\nthe world--St. Peter's. We mounted the pyramid of steps and looked up,\r\nbut were not overcome by the magnificence. We read in our guide-book\r\nthat the edifice covers eight acres, and to the tip-top of the cross is\r\nalmost five hundred feet; that it took three hundred and fifty years and\r\ntwelve successive artists to finish it, and an expenditure of\r\n$50,000,000, and now costs $30,000 per annum to keep it in repair; still\r\nwe did not appreciate its greatness. We pushed aside the curtain and\r\nwalked in--walked a day's journey across the transept and up and down\r\nthe everlasting nave, and yet continued heterodox. We tried hard to\r\nbelieve it was very vast and sublime, and knew we ought to feel its\r\ngrandeur, but somehow we did not. Then we sat down by the Holy of\r\nHolies, and there we were startled into a better judgment by the\r\nastounding fact that the Cathedral of St. Paul--the largest edifice in\r\nGreat Britain--could stand upright, spire, dome, body, and all, inside\r\nof St. Peter's! that the letters of the inscription which run around the\r\n_base_ of the dome, though apparently but an inch, are in reality six\r\nfeet high! Then, for the first time, the scales fell from our eyes; the\r\ngiant building began to grow; higher and higher still it rose, longer\r\nand deeper it expanded, yet in perfect proportions; the colossal\r\nstructure, now a living temple, put on its beautiful garments and the\r\nrobe of majesty. And that dome! the longer we looked at it the vaster it\r\ngrew, till finally it seemed to be a temple not made with hands; the\r\nspacious canopy became the firmament; the mosaic figures of cherubim and\r\nseraphim were endowed with life; and as we fixed our eyes on the zenith\r\nwhere the Almighty is represented in glory, we thought we had the vision\r\nof Stephen. Long we gazed upward into this heaven of man's creation, and\r\ngazed again till we were lost in wonder.\r\n\r\nBut the traveler needs no such steps to lift him up to the grand\r\nconception of the divine Architect as he beholds the great white dome of\r\nChimborazo. It looks lofty from the very first. Now and then an expanse\r\nof thin, sky-like vapor would cut the mountain in twain, and the dome,\r\nislanded in the deep blue of the upper regions, seemed to belong more to\r\nheaven than to earth. We knew that Chimborazo was more than twice the\r\naltitude of Etna. We could almost see the great Humboldt struggling up\r\nthe mountain's side till he looked like a black speck moving over the\r\nmighty white, but giving up in despair four thousand feet below the\r\nsummit. We see the intrepid Bolivar mounting still higher; but the hero\r\nof Spanish-American independence returns a defeated man. Last of all\r\ncomes the philosophic Boussingault, and attains the prodigious elevation\r\nof nineteen thousand six hundred feet--the highest point reached by man\r\nwithout the aid of a balloon; but the dome remains unsullied by his\r\nfoot. Yet none of these facts increase our admiration. The mountain has\r\na tongue which speaks louder than all mathematical calculations.\r\n\r\nThere must be something singularly sublime about Chimborazo, for the\r\nspectator at Riobamba is already nine thousand feet high, and the\r\nmountain is not so elevated above him as Mont Blanc above the vale of\r\nChamounî, when, in reality, that culminating point of Europe would not\r\nreach up even to the snow-limit of Chimborazo by two thousand feet.[69]\r\nIt is only while sailing on the Pacific that one sees Chimborazo in its\r\ncomplete proportions. Its very magnitude diminishes the impression of\r\nawe and wonder, for the Andes on which it rests are heaved to such a\r\nvast altitude above the sea, that the relative elevation of its summit\r\nbecomes reduced by comparison with the surrounding mountains. Its\r\naltitude is 21,420 feet, or forty-five times the height of Strasburg\r\nCathedral; or, to state it otherwise, the fall of one pound from the top\r\nof Chimborazo would raise the temperature of water 30°. One fourth of\r\nthis is perpetually covered with snow, so that its ancient name,\r\nChimpurazu--the mountain of snow--is very appropriate.[70] It is a\r\nstirring thought that this mountain, now mantled with snow, once gleamed\r\nwith volcanic fires. There is a hot spring on the north side, and an\r\nimmense amount of débris covers the slope below the snow-limit,\r\nconsisting chiefly of fine-grained, iron-stained trachyte and coarse\r\nporphyroid gray trachyte; very rarely a dark vitreous trachyte.\r\nChimborazo is very likely not a solid mountain: trachytic volcanoes are\r\nsupposed to be full of cavities. Bouguer found it made the plumb-line\r\ndeviate 7\" or 8\".\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: But Chimborazo is steeper than the Alp-king; and steepness\r\nis a quality more quickly appreciated than mere massiveness. \"Mont Blanc\r\n(says a writer in _Frazer's Magazine_) is scarcely admired, because he\r\nis built with a certain regard to stability; but the apparently reckless\r\narchitecture of the Matterhorn brings the traveler fairly on his knees,\r\nwith a respect akin to that felt for the leaning tower of Pisa, or the\r\nsoaring pinnacles of Antwerp.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: \"White Mountain\" is the natural and almost uniform name of\r\nthe highest mountains in all countries: thus Himalaya, Mont Blanc,\r\nHocmus, Sierra Nevada, Ben Nevis, Snowdon, Lebanon, White Mountains of\r\nUnited States, Chimborazo, and Illimani.]\r\n\r\nThe valleys which furrow the flank of Chimborazo are in keeping with its\r\ncolossal size. Narrower, but deeper than those of the Alps, the mind\r\nswoons and sinks in the effort to comprehend their grim majesty. The\r\nmountain appears to have been broken to pieces like so much thin crust,\r\nand the strata thrown on their vertical edges, revealing deep, dark\r\nchasms, that seem to lead to the confines of the lower world. The\r\ndeepest valley in Europe, that of the Ordesa in the Pyrenees, is 3200\r\nfeet deep; but here are rents in the side of Chimborazo in which\r\nVesuvius could be put away out of sight. As you look down into the\r\nfathomless fissure, you see a white fleck rising out of the gulf, and\r\nexpanding as it mounts, till the wings of the condor, fifteen feet in\r\nspread, glitter in the sun as the proud bird fearlessly wheels over the\r\ndizzy chasm, and then, ascending above your head, sails over the dome of\r\nChimborazo.[71] Could the condor speak, what a glowing description could\r\nhe give of the landscape beneath him when his horizon is a thousand\r\nmiles in diameter. If\r\n\r\n    \"Twelve fair counties saw the blaze from Malvern's lonely height,\"\r\n\r\nwhat must be the panorama from a height fifteen times higher!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Humboldt's statement that the condor flies higher than\r\nChimborazo has been questioned; but we have seen numbers hovering at\r\nleast a thousand feet above the summit of Pichincha. Baron Müller, in\r\nhis ascent of Orizaba, saw two falcons flying at the height of full\r\n18,000 feet; Dr. Hooker found crows and ravens on the Himalayas at\r\n16,500 feet; and flocks of wild geese are said to fly over the peak of\r\nKintschinghow, 22,756 feet.]\r\n\r\nChimborazo was long supposed to be the tallest mountain on the globe,\r\nbut its supremacy has been supplanted by Mount Everest in Asia, and\r\nAconcagua in Chile.[72] In mountain gloom and glory, however, it still\r\nstands unrivaled. The Alps have the avalanche, \"the thunderbolt of\r\nsnow,\" and the glaciers, those icy Niagaras so beautiful and grand. Here\r\nthey are wanting.[73] The monarch of the Andes sits motionless in calm\r\nserenity and unbroken silence. The silence is absolute and actually\r\noppressive. The road from Guayaquil to Quito crosses Chimborazo at the\r\nelevation of fourteen thousand feet. Save the rush of the trade wind in\r\nthe afternoon, as it sweeps over the Andes, not a sound is audible; not\r\nthe hum of an insect, nor the chirp of a bird, nor the roar of the puma,\r\nnor the music of running waters. Mid-ocean is never so silent. You can\r\nalmost hear the globe turning on its axis. There was a time when the\r\nmonarch deigned to speak, and spoke with a voice of thunder, for the\r\nlava on its sides is an evidence of volcanic activity. But ever since\r\nthe morning stars sang together over man's creation, Chimbo has sat in\r\nsullen silence, satisfied to look \"from his throne of clouds o'er half\r\nthe world.\" There is something very suggestive in this silence of\r\nChimborazo. It was once full of noise and fury; it is now a _completed_\r\nmountain, and thunders no more. How silent was Jesus, a completed\r\ncharacter! The reason we are so noisy is that we are so full of wants;\r\nwe are _unfinished_ characters. Had we perfect fullness of all things,\r\nthe beatitude of being without a want, we should lapse into the eternal\r\nsilence of God.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Mount Everest is 29,000 feet, and Aconcagua 23,200.\r\nSchlagintweit enumerates thirteen Himalayan summits over 25,000 feet,\r\nand forty-six above 20,000. We have little confidence in the estimates\r\nof the Bolivian mountains. Chimborazo has nearly the same latitude and\r\naltitude as the loftiest peak in Africa, Kilima Njaro.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Humboldt ascribes the absence of glaciers in the Andes to\r\nthe extreme steepness of the sides, and the excessive dryness of the\r\nair. Dr. Loomis, above quoted, mentions indications of glacial\r\naction--moraines, and polished and striated rocks--on the crest of the\r\nCordillera, between Peru and Bolivia, lat. 21° S.]\r\n\r\nChimborazo is a leader of a long train of ambitious crags and peaks; but\r\nas he who comes after the king must not expect to be noticed, we will\r\nonly take a glimpse of these lesser lights as we pass up the Western\r\nCordillera, and then down the Eastern.\r\n\r\nThe first after leaving the monarch is Caraguairazo. The Indians call it\r\n\"the wife of Chimborazo.\" They are separated only by a very narrow\r\nvalley. One hundred and seventy years ago the top of this mountain fell\r\nin, and torrents of mud flowed out containing multitudes of fishes. It\r\nis now over seventeen thousand feet high, and is one of the most Alpine\r\nof the Quitonian volcanoes, having sharp pinnacles instead of the smooth\r\ntrachytic domes--usually double domes--so characteristic of the Andean\r\nsummits. And now we pass in rapid succession numerous picturesque\r\nmountains, some of them extinct volcanoes, as Iliniza, presenting two\r\npyramidal peaks, the highest seventeen thousand feet above the sea, and\r\nCorazon, so named from its heart-shaped summit, till we reach Pichincha,\r\nwhose smoking crater is only five miles distant in a straight line from\r\nthe city of Quito, or eleven by the traveled route.\r\n\r\nThe crown of this mountain presents three groups of rocky peaks. The\r\nmost westerly one is called Rucu-Pichincha, and alone manifests\r\nactivity. To the northeast of Rucu is Guagua-Pichincha, a ruined flue of\r\nthe same fiery furnace; and between the two is Cundur-guachana.[74]\r\nPichincha is the only volcano in Ecuador which has not a true\r\ncone-crater. Some violent eruption beyond the reach of history or\r\ntradition has formed an enormous funnel-shaped basin 2500 feet deep,[75]\r\n1500 in diameter at the bottom, and expanding upward to a width of three\r\nfourths of a mile. It is the _deepest_ crater on the globe. That of\r\nKilauea is 600 feet; Orizaba, 500; Etna, 300; Hecla, 100. Vesuvius is a\r\nportable furnace in comparison. The abyss is girt with a ragged wall of\r\ndark trachyte, which rises on the inside at various angles between 45°\r\nand perpendicularity. As we know of but one American besides the members\r\nof our expedition (Mr. Farrand, a photographer) who has succeeded in\r\nentering the crater of this interesting volcano, we will give a brief\r\nsketch of our visit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Pichincha, in the Inca language, signifies \"the boiling\r\nmountain;\" Rucu means old; Guagua, young; and Cundur-guachana, the\r\ncondor's nest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: More accurately, 2527 feet; Wisse and Moreno made it\r\n2460.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crater of Pichincha.]\r\n\r\nLeaving Quito in the afternoon by the old arched gateway at the foot of\r\nPanecillo, and crossing a spur of the mountain, we stopped for the night\r\nat the Jesuit hacienda, situated in the beautiful valley of Lloa, but\r\nnearly ruined by the earthquake of 1859. On the damp walls of this\r\nmonastery, perched 10,268 feet above the ocean, we found several old\r\npaintings, among them a copy of the _Visitation_ by Rubens. The sunset\r\nviews in this heart of the Andes were surpassingly beautiful. Mounting\r\nour horses at break of day, and taking an Indian guide, we ascended\r\nrapidly, by a narrow and difficult path, through the forest that belts\r\nthe volcano, up to the height of 12,000 feet, emerging gradually into a\r\nthicket of stunted bushes, and then entered the dreary paramo. Splendid\r\nwas the view of the Eastern Cordillera. At least six dazzling white\r\nvolcanoes were in sight just across the Valley of Quito, among them\r\ntable-topped Cayambi, majestic Antisana, and princely Cotopaxi, whose\r\ntapering summit is a mile above the clouds. Toiling upward, we reached\r\nthe base of the cone, where vegetation ceased entirely; and, tying our\r\nhorses to some huge rocks that had fallen from the mural cliff above,\r\nstarted off on hands and feet for the crater. The cone is deeply covered\r\nwith sand and cinders for about two hundred feet, and the sides are\r\ninclined at an angle of about 35°. At ten o'clock we reached the brim of\r\nthe crater, and the great gulf burst suddenly into view. We can never\r\nforget the impression made upon us by the sight. We speak of many things\r\nhere below as awful, but that word has its full meaning when carried to\r\nthe top of Pichincha. There you see a frightful opening in the earth's\r\ncrust nearly a mile in width and half a mile deep, and from the dark\r\nabyss comes rolling up a cloud of sulphurous vapors. Monte Somma in the\r\ntime of Strabo was a miniature; but this crater is on the top of a\r\nmountain four times the height of the Italian volcano. Imagination finds\r\nit difficult to conceive a spectacle of more fearful grandeur or such\r\nsolemn magnificence. It well accords with Milton's picture of the\r\nbottomless pit. The united effect of the silence and solitude of the\r\nplace, the great depth of the cavity, the dark precipitous sides, and\r\nthe column of smoke standing over an unseen crevice, was to us more\r\nimpressive than thundering Cotopaxi or fiery Vesuvius. Humboldt,\r\nafter standing on this same brink, exclaimed, \"I have never beheld a\r\ngrander or more remarkable picture than that presented by this volcano;\"\r\nand La Condamine compared it to \"the Chaos of the poets.\" Below us are\r\nthe smouldering fires which may any moment spring forth into a\r\nconflagration; around us are black, ragged cliffs--fit boundary for this\r\ngateway to the infernal regions. They look as if they had just been\r\ndragged up from the central furnace of the earth. Life seems to have\r\nfled in terror from the vicinity; even lichens, the children of the bare\r\nrocks, refuse to clothe the scathed and beetling crags. For some\r\nmoments, made mute by the dreadful sight, we stood like statues on the\r\nrim of the mighty caldron, with our eyes riveted on the abyss below,\r\nlost in contemplating that which can not be described. The panorama from\r\nthis lofty summit is more pleasing, but equally sublime. Toward the\r\nrising sun is the long range of the Eastern Cordillera, hiding from our\r\nview the great valley of the Amazon. To right and left are the peaks of\r\nanother procession of august mountains from Cotocachí to Chimborazo. We\r\nare surrounded by the great patriarchs of the Andes, and their speaker,\r\nCotopaxi, ever and anon sends his muttering voice over the land. The\r\nview westward is like looking down from a balloon. Those parallel ridges\r\nof the mountain chain, dropping one behind the other, are the gigantic\r\nstaircase by which the ice-crowned Chimborazo steps down to the sea. A\r\nwhite sea of clouds covers the peaceful Pacific and the lower parts of\r\nthe coast. But the vapory ocean, curling into the ravines, beautifully\r\nrepresents little coves and bays, leaving islands and promontories like\r\na true ocean on a broken shore. We seem raised above the earth, which\r\nlies like an opened map below us; we can look down on the upper surface\r\nof the clouds, and, were it night, down too upon the lightnings.\r\n\r\nThe crater of Pichincha has a sharp, serrated edge, which, happily for\r\nQuito, is broken down on the west side, so that in the next eruption the\r\nvolcano will doubtless pour its contents into the wilds of Esmeraldas.\r\nThe highest pinnacle is 15,827 feet; so that the mountain just enters\r\nthe region of perpetual winter. Water boils at 185°. The summit is\r\ngenerally bare, though snow is always found in the clefts of the rocks.\r\nIt is not compact or crystalline, but resembles a conglomerate of little\r\nhailstones.[76] Out of the mingled snow and pumice-dust rise a few\r\ndelicate flowers, particularly the violet _Sida Pichinchensis_, the same\r\nwhich we had observed on the side of Chimborazo. Think of gay flowers a\r\nthousand feet higher than the top of Mont Blanc!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: The snow on the top of Mont Blanc is like dry dust; in\r\nLapland, in open places, it consists of hexagonal crystals, and is\r\ncalled by the inhabitants \"sand-snow.\" The French and Spanish\r\nmathematicians, Bouguer, La Condamine, and Ulloa, in their story of\r\nascending Pichincha, give a long and dreadful account of their\r\nsufferings from cold and rarefied air: \"whilst eating, every one was\r\nobliged to keep his plate over a chafing-dish of coals, to prevent his\r\nfood from freezing.\" The traveler nowadays finds only a chilling wind.\r\nThis rise of temperature, coupled with the fact that La Condamine\r\n(1745), Humboldt (1802), Boussingault (1831), and Wisse (1863) give to\r\nQuito a decreasing altitude, inclines us to believe, with Boussingault,\r\nthat the Andes are sinking. Since the activity of the volcano in 1868,\r\nthe summit has been so warm that the snow has totally disappeared.\r\nIce-cream has in consequence risen in price in Quito, as snow must be\r\nbrought from Sincholagua, four days' journey.]\r\n\r\nThe first to reach the brink of the crater were the French Academicians\r\nin 1742. Sixty years after, Humboldt stood on the summit. But it was not\r\ntill 1844 that any one dared to enter the crater. This was accomplished\r\nby Garcia Moreno, now President of Ecuador, and Sebastian Wisse, a\r\nFrench engineer. Humboldt pronounced the bottom of the crater\r\n\"inaccessible, from its great depth and precipitous descent.\" We found\r\nit accessible, but exceedingly perilous. The moment we prepared to\r\ndescend our guide ran away. We went on without him, but when halfway\r\ndown were stopped by a precipice.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of October, 1867, we returned to Pichincha with another\r\nguide, and entered the crater by a different route. Manuel, our Indian,\r\nled us to the south side, and over the brink we went. We were not long\r\nin realizing the danger of the undertaking. Here the snow concealed an\r\nugly fissure or covered a treacherous rock (for nearly all the rocks are\r\ncrumbling); there we must cross a mass of loose sand moving like a\r\nglacier down the almost vertical side of the crater; and on every hand\r\nrocks were giving way, and, gathering momentum at each revolution, went\r\nthundering down, leaping over precipices, and jostling other rocks,\r\nwhich joined in the race, till they all struck the bottom with a deep\r\nrumbling sound, shivered like so many bombshells into a thousand pieces,\r\nand telling us what would be our fate it we made a single misstep. We\r\nfollowed our Indian in single file, keeping close together, that the\r\nstones set free by those in the rear might not dash those below from\r\ntheir feet; feeling our way with the greatest caution, clinging with our\r\nhands to snow, sand, rock, tufts of grass, or any thing that would hold\r\nfor a moment; now leaping over a chasm, now letting ourselves down from\r\nrock to rock; at times paralyzed with fear, and always with death\r\nstaring us in the face; thus we scrambled for two hours and a half, till\r\nwe reached the bottom of the crater.\r\n\r\nHere we found a deeply-furrowed plain, strewn with ragged rocks, and\r\ncontaining a few patches of vegetation, with half a dozen species of\r\nflowers. In the centre is an irregular heap of stones, two hundred and\r\nsixty feet high by eight hundred in diameter. This is the cone of\r\neruption--its sides and summit covered with an imposing group of vents,\r\nseventy in number, all lined with sulphur and exhaling steam, black\r\nsmoke, and sulphurous gas. The temperature of the vapor just within the\r\nfumarole is 184°, water boiling beside it at 189°. The central vent, or\r\nchimney, gives forth a sound like the violent bubbling of boiling water.\r\nAs we sat on this fiery mount, surrounded by a circular rampart of\r\nrocks, and looked up at the immense towers of dark dolerite which ran up\r\nalmost vertically to the height of twenty-five hundred feet above us,\r\nmusing over the tremendous force which fashioned this awful\r\namphitheatre--spacious enough for all the gods of Tartarus to hold high\r\ncarnival--the clouds which hung in the thin air around the crest of the\r\ncrater pealed forth thunder after thunder, which, reverberating from\r\nprecipice to precipice, were answered by the crash of rocks let loose by\r\nthe storm, till the whole mountain seemed to tremble like a leaf. Such\r\nacoustics, mingled with the flash of lightning and the smell of\r\nbrimstone, made us believe that we had fairly got into the realm of\r\nPluto. It is the spot where Dante's _Inferno_ ought to be read.\r\n\r\nFinishing our observations, and warming our dinner over the steaming\r\ncrevices, we prepared to ascend. The escape from this horrid hole was\r\nmore perilous than the entrance, and on reaching the top we sang, with\r\ngrateful hearts, to the tune of \"Old Hundred,\"\r\n\r\n     \"Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.\"\r\n\r\nWe doubt whether that famous tune and glorious doxology were ever sung\r\nso near to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe second line,\r\n\r\n     \"Praise him all creatures here below,\"\r\n\r\nhad a strange meaning fifteen thousand feet high.\r\n\r\nThere have been five eruptions of Pichincha since the Conquest. The last\r\nwas in 1660; that of 1566 covered Quito three feet deep with ashes and\r\nstones, while boiling water and bitumen descended in torrents. In 1867\r\nthe column of smoke did not rise above the crest of the crater, but the\r\nvolcano has lately been showing signs of activity, such as it has not\r\nexhibited since the last grand eruption two centuries ago. On the 19th\r\nof March, 1868, detonations were audible at Quito, and three days after\r\nthere were more thunderings, with a great column of vapor visible from\r\nChillo, twelve miles to the east. These phenomena were accompanied by an\r\nunusual fall of rain. Since the great earthquake of August 16th,\r\nPichincha has continued to send forth dense columns of black smoke, and\r\nso much fine sand that it is not possible to reach the crater. The solid\r\nproducts of Pichincha since the Conquest have been chiefly pumice,\r\ncoarse-grained and granular trachyte, and reddish porphyroid trachyte.\r\nThe roads leading to Quito cut through hills of pumice-dust. On the\r\nplain of Iñaquito and in the valley of Esmeraldas are vast erratic\r\nblocks of trachyte, some containing twenty-five cubic yards, having\r\nsharp angles, and in some cases a polished, unstriated surface. M. Wisse\r\ndoes not consider them to have been thrown out of Pichincha, as La\r\nCondamine and others have judged. It is true, as he says, that they\r\ncould not have come out of the present cone at a less angle than 45°,\r\nfor they would have hit the sides of the high rocky rampart and rolled\r\nback again; and at a higher angle they would not have reached their\r\npresent location. But we see no reason why they could not be the upper\r\nportion of the solid trachyte cone blown into the air at the great\r\neruption which cleared out this enormous crater. There is a _rumipamba_,\r\nor \"field of stones,\" around each of the Quitonian volcanoes.\r\n\r\nLeaving Pichincha, we travel northward along the battlemented Andes,\r\npassing by the conical mountains of Yana-urcu and Cotocachí. Yana-urcu,\r\nor \"black mountain,\" is a mass of calcined rocks. Cotocachí (from\r\n_cota_? and _cachí_, salt) is always snow-clad. On its side is Cuycocha,\r\none of the highest lakes in the world (10,200 feet), and formed by the\r\nsubsidence of a part of the volcano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     The Volcanoes of Ecuador.--Eastern\r\n     Cordillera.--Imbabura.--Cayambi.--Antisana.--Cotopaxi.--Llanganati.\r\n     --Tunguragua.--Altar.--Sangai.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the once busy city of Otovalo, utterly destroyed in the late\r\nearthquake, the two Cordilleras join, and, turning to the right, we go\r\ndown the eastern range. The first in order is Imbabura,[77] which poured\r\nforth a large quantity of mud, with thousands of fishes, seven years\r\nbefore the similar eruption of Caraguairazo. At its feet is the\r\nbeautiful lake of San Pablo, five miles in circumference, and very deep.\r\nIt contains the little black fish (_Pimelodes cyclopum_) already\r\nreferred to as the only species in the valley, and the same that was\r\ncast out by Imbabura and Caraguairazo. Next comes the square-topped\r\nCayambi--the loftiest mountain in this Cordillera, being nineteen\r\nthousand five hundred feet. It stands exactly on the equator, a colossal\r\nmonument placed by the hand of Nature to mark the grand division of the\r\nglobe. It is the only snowy spot, says Humboldt, which is crossed by the\r\nequator. Beautiful is the view of Cayambi from Quito, as its enormous\r\nmass of snow and ice glows with crimson splendor in the farewell rays of\r\nthe setting sun. No painter's brush could do justice to the prismatic\r\ntints which hover around the higher peaks. But this flood of glory is\r\nsoon followed by the pure whiteness of death. \"Like a gigantic ghost\r\nshrouded in sepulchral sheets, the mountain now hovers in the background\r\nof the landscape, towering ghastly through the twilight until darkness\r\ncloses upon the scene.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: From _imba_ (fish), and _bura_, to produce. Its name can\r\nnot be older than 1691, unless the mountain made similar eruptions\r\nbefore. It has frequently ejected water.]\r\n\r\nTen miles farther south is the bare-headed Guamani range, over which\r\npasses the road to the wild Napo country.[78] The view from the crest is\r\nmagnificent; but, like every grand panorama, eludes description. As we\r\nlook eastward over the beginnings of the mighty forest which stretches\r\nunbroken to the Atlantic, the vast ridges, trending north and south, and\r\ndecreasing in height as they increase in distance, seem like the waves\r\nof a great ocean rolling toward the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: The culminating point of Guamani is _Sara-urcu_, a volcano\r\nwhich threw out a vast quantity of ashes in 1843 and 1856.]\r\n\r\nNear by stands Antisana in his snowy robe. This volcano ranks next to\r\nChimborazo in dignity. It has a double dome, and an elevation of 19,000\r\nfeet. Snow of Dian purity covers it for over 3000 feet; but, judging\r\nfrom the enormous streams of lava on its sides, it must have been a\r\nfierce volcano in ages past. The lava streams are worthy of the great\r\nmountain from which they flowed. One of them (called \"Volcan d'Ansango\")\r\nis ten miles long and five hundred feet deep, with an average slope of\r\n15°. It is a magnificent sight, as seen from the surrounding paramo--a\r\nstream of dark, ragged rocks coming down out of the clouds and snows\r\nwhich cover the summit. The representative products of Antisana are a\r\nblack, cellular, vitreous trachyte, a fine-grained, tough porphyroid\r\ntrachyte, and a coarse reddish porphyroid trachyte. An eruption, as late\r\nas 1590, is recorded in _Johnston's Phys. Atlas_. Humboldt saw smoke\r\nissuing from several openings in March, 1802.\r\n\r\nWe ascended this volcano to the height of sixteen thousand feet. On its\r\nside is the celebrated hacienda of Antisana, which, more than sixty\r\nyears ago, sheltered the great Humboldt from the sleet and rain and\r\nblast of this lofty region. It was a welcome refuge to us, for we had\r\nwell nigh perished with cold on the dreary paramo. It is one of the\r\nhighest human habitations in the world, being thirteen thousand three\r\nhundred feet above the sea, or a thousand feet higher than the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe.[79] The mean temperature is the same as that of Quebec, so\r\nthat thirteen thousand feet in elevation at the equator is equal to 47°\r\nin latitude.[80] Here is an extensive corral, inclosing thousands of\r\ncattle, owned by a rheumatic old gentleman, Señor Valdevieso, who\r\nsupplies the beef-market of Quito.[81] A desire for beef has alone\r\nbrought man and his beast to this chilly altitude. It is difficult to\r\nget a quart of milk, and impossible to find a pound of butter at this\r\nhacienda. The predominant colors of the cattle are red and black. They\r\nfeed on the wild paramo grass, and the beef is not only remarkably\r\ncheap, but superior in quality. The lasso is used in catching the\r\nanimals, but not so skillfully as by the Gauchos of Rio Plata. It is a\r\nsingular fact that cattle have followed men over the whole earth, from\r\nthe coast of Africa to the highlands of Antisana. The same species is\r\nattacked by crocodiles and condors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: M. d'Abbadie professes to have visited a village in\r\nAbyssinia (Arquiage) which is 12,450 feet above the sea. Potosi stands\r\n13,500 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: This agrees with Humboldt's calculation that a difference\r\nof elevation of 278 feet produces the same effect on the annual\r\ntemperature as a change of one degree of latitude. According to the\r\nexperiments of Captain Pullen, the minimum temperature of the great\r\ndepths of the ocean 35°, and it commences soon after passing 12,000\r\nfeet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: The great dépôts of cattle in Ecuador are at the two\r\nextremes of elevation, the lowlands of St. Elena and the highlands of\r\nAntisana. On the slope of Cayambi is another extensive cattle estate.]\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric pressure is here so small that they frequently bleed at\r\nthe nose and mouth when hunted. We have already given our experience in\r\nascending high altitudes. We may add that while the pulse of\r\nBoussingault beat 106 pulsations at the height of 18,600 feet on\r\nChimborazo, ours was 87 at 16,000 feet on Antisana. De Saussure says\r\nthat a draught of liquor which would inebriate in the lowlands no\r\nlonger has that effect on Mont Blanc. This appears to be true on the\r\nAndes; indeed, there is very little drunkenness in Quito. So the higher\r\nwe perch our inebriate asylums, the better for the patients.\r\n\r\nNear the hacienda is a little lake called Mica, on which we found a\r\nspecies of grebe, with wings so short it could not fly. Its legs, also,\r\nseem fitted only for paddling, and it goes ashore only to lay its eggs.\r\nIt peeps like a gosling. Associated with them were penguins (in\r\nappearance); they were so shy we could not secure one. The query is, How\r\ncame they there? Was this a centre of creation, or were the fowls\r\nupheaved with the Andes? They could not have flown or walked to this\r\nlofty lake, and there are no water-courses leading to it; it is\r\nsurrounded with a dry, rolling waste, where only the condor lives. We\r\nturn to Darwin for an answer.[82]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: The grebe is considered by Messrs. Cassin and Lawrence to\r\nbe the _Podiceps occipitalis_, Lisson (_P. calipareus et Chilensis_ of\r\nGarnot), which occurs in large flocks on the coast of Chile and in the\r\nStraits of Magellan. It is quite different from the _P. micropterus_ of\r\nLake Titicaca. At Morococha, Peru, 15,600 feet above the sea, Herndon\r\nfound snipes and ducks.]\r\n\r\nThe ragged Sincholagua[83] and romantic Rumiñagui follow Antisana, and\r\nthen we find ourselves looking up at the most beautiful and most\r\nterrible of volcanoes. This is the far-famed Cotopaxi, or more properly\r\nCutu-pacsi, meaning \"a brilliant mass.\" Humboldt calls it the most\r\nregular and most picturesque of volcanic cones. It looks like a huge\r\ntruncated cone rising out of the Valley of Quito, its sides deeply\r\nfurrowed by the rivers of mud and water which have so often flowed out.\r\nThe cone itself is about six thousand feet high. The east side is\r\ncovered with snow, but the west is nearly bare, owing to the trade\r\nwinds, which, sweeping across the continent, carry the ashes westward.\r\nCotopaxi is the loftiest of active volcanoes, though its grand eruptions\r\nare a century apart, according to the general rule that the higher a\r\nvolcano the less frequent its eruptions, but all the more terrible when\r\nthey do occur. Imagine Vesuvius on the summit of Mont Blanc, and you\r\nhave the altitude of Cotopaxi.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: In Brigham's _Notes on the Volcanic Phenomena of the\r\nHawaiian Islands_, this volcano is put down as active, but there has\r\nbeen no eruption in the memory of man. Its lithology is represented in\r\nour collection by porous, gray, granular trachyte, fine-grained, compact\r\ntrachyte, and dark porphyroid trachyte. The derivation of Sincholagua is\r\nunknown, Rumiñagui means the face of a rock, Cotopaxi, Sincholagua, and\r\nRumiñagui, and Cotopaxi, Pichincha, and Guamani, form equilateral\r\ntriangles.]\r\n\r\nThe top just reaches the middle point of density in the atmosphere, for\r\nat the height of three miles and a half the air below will balance that\r\nabove. The crater has never been seen by man; the steepness of the sides\r\nand the depth of the ashes covering them render it inaccessible. The\r\nvaliant Col. Hall tried it with scaling ladders, only to fail. The\r\ntelescope reveals a parapet of scoria on the brim, as on Teneriffe.\r\nHumboldt's sketch of the volcano, so universally copied, is overdrawn.\r\nIt makes the slope about 50°, while in truth it is nearer 30°. The\r\napical angle is 122° 30'.[84]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: MM. Zurcher and Margalli make the slope 55°! and Guzman,\r\n69° 30'!! The slope of Mauna Loa is 6° 30'; of Etna, 9°; of Teneriffe,\r\n12° 30'; of Vesuvius, 35°. While cinder-cones may have an angle of 40°,\r\nlava-cones seldom exceed 10°.]\r\n\r\nCotopaxi is slumbering now; or, as Mr. Coan says of Hilo, it is \"in a\r\nstate of solemn and thoughtful suspense.\" The only signs of life are the\r\ndeep rumbling thunders and a cloud of smoke lazily issuing from the\r\ncrater.[85] Sometimes at night the smoke looks like a pillar of fire,\r\nand fine ashes and sand often fall around the base, to the great\r\nannoyance of the farmers. On the south side is a huge rock of porphyry,\r\ncalled the Inca's Head. Tradition has it that this was the original\r\nsummit of the volcano, torn off and hurled down by an eruption on the\r\nvery day Atahuallpa was murdered by Pizarro. The last great eruption\r\noccurred in 1803, though so late as 1855 it tossed out stones, water,\r\nand sand. Heaps of ruins, piled up during the lapse of ages, are\r\nscattered for miles around the mountain, among them great boulders\r\ntwenty feet square. In one place (Quinchevar) the accumulation is 600\r\nfeet deep. Between Cotopaxi and Sincholagua are numerous conical hills\r\ncovering the paramo, reminding one of the mud volcanoes of Jorullo.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Even this has now (August, 1869) ceased, save an\r\noccasional grumble, and the Tacungans are trembling with fear of another\r\neruption.]\r\n\r\nPumice and trachyte are the most common rocks around this mountain, and\r\nthese are augitic or porphyroid. Obsidian also occurs, though not on the\r\nimmediate flank, but farther down near Chillo. In plowing, thousands of\r\npieces as large as \"flints\" are turned up. The natives know nothing\r\nabout their origin or use; the large specimens were anciently polished\r\nand used for mirror. But Cotopaxi is the great pumice-producing volcano.\r\nThe new road up the valley cuts through a lofty hill formed by the\r\nsuccessive eruptions; the section, presenting alternate layers of mud,\r\nashes, and pumice, is a written history of the volcano.[86] The cone\r\nitself is evidently composed of similar beds super-imposed, and holding\r\nfragments of porphyry and trachyte. What is Vesuvius, four thousand feet\r\nhigh, to Cotopaxi, belching forth fire from a crater fifteen thousand\r\nfeet higher, and shooting its contents three thousand feet above its\r\nsnow-bound summit, with a voice of thunder heard six hundred miles!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Compare the following sections:\r\n\r\nCOTOPAXI (near Tiupullo).\r\nSoil                                        1 ft. 0 in.\r\nFine yellow pumice                          5  \"  0  \"\r\nCompact black ashes, with seams of pumice  10  \"  0  \"\r\nFine yellow pumice                          1  \"  6  \"\r\nCompact black ashes                        12  \"  0  \"\r\nFine yellow pumice                          2  \"  0  \"\r\nCompact black ashes, with seams of pumice.\r\n\r\nVESUVIUS (at Pompeii).\r\nSoil                                        3 ft. 0 in.\r\nBrown incoherent tuff                       1  \"  6  \"\r\nSmall scoriæ and white lapilli              0  \"  3  \"\r\nBrown earthy tuff                           4  \"  9  \"\r\nWhitish lapilli                             0  \"  1  \"\r\nGray solid tuff                             0  \"  3  \"\r\nPumice and white lapilli                    0  \"  3  \"\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nLeaving this terrible \"safety-valve\" to the imprisoned fires under our\r\nfeet, we travel along the wooded flanks and savage valleys of the\r\nLlanganati Mountains, whose lofty blue ridge is here and there pointed\r\nwith snow.[87] It is universally believed that the Incas buried an\r\nimmense quantity of gold in an artificial lake on the sides of this\r\nmountain during the Spanish invasion, and many an adventurous expedition\r\nhas been made for it. The inhabitants will tell you of one Valverde, a\r\nSpaniard, who, from being very poor, had suddenly become very rich,\r\nwhich was attributed to his having married an Indian girl whose father\r\nshowed him where the treasure was hidden, and accompanied him on various\r\noccasions to bring away portions of it; and that Valverde returned to\r\nSpain, and on his death-bed bequeathed the secret of his riches to the\r\nking. But since Padre Longo suddenly disappeared while leading an\r\nexpedition, the timid Ecuadorians have been content with their\r\npoverty.[88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Immediately south of Cotopaxi, the Cordillera consists of\r\nparamos sown with lakes and morasses, and is rarely covered with snow.\r\nLlanganati is probably from _llánga_, to touch: they touch the sources\r\nof nearly all the Ecuadorian rivers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: The story is doubtless due to the fact that the eastern\r\nstreams, which issue from the foot of this cordillera, are auriferous.]\r\n\r\nAnd now we have reached the perfect cone of Tunguragua, the rival of\r\nCotopaxi in symmetry and beauty.[89] It stands 16,500 feet above the\r\nPacific, its upper part covered with a splendid robe of snow, while the\r\nsugar-cane grows in the romantic town of Baños, 10,000 feet below the\r\nsummit. A cataract, 1500 feet high, comes down at three bounds from the\r\nedge of the snow to the warm valley beneath; and at Baños a hot\r\nferruginous spring and a stream of ice-water flow out of the volcano\r\nside by side. Here, too, the fierce youth of the Pastassa, born on the\r\npumice slopes of Cotopaxi, dashes through a deep tortuous chasm and down\r\na precipice in hot haste, as if conscious of the long distance before it\r\nere it reaches the Amazon and the ocean. Tunguragua was once a\r\nformidable mountain, for we discovered a great stream of lava reaching\r\nfrom the clouds around the summit to the orange-groves in the valley,\r\nand blocking up the rivers which tumble over it in beautiful cascades.\r\nIt has been silent since 1780; but it can afford to rest, for then its\r\nactivity lasted seven years.[90]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: From Tungúri, the ankle-joint, alluding to its apical\r\nangle. It is a little steeper than Cotopaxi, having a slope of 38°.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Spruce asserts that he saw smoke issuing from the western\r\nedge in 1857; and Dr. Terry says that in 1832 smoke ascended almost\r\nalways from the summit. Dr. Taylor, of Riobamba, informs the writer that\r\nsmoke is now almost constantly visible. The characteristic rock is a\r\nblack vitreous trachyte resembling pitchstone, but anhydrous.]\r\n\r\nClose by rises beautiful Altar, a thousand feet higher. The Indians call\r\nit Capac-urcu, or the \"Chief.\" They say it once overtopped Chimborazo;\r\nbut, after a violent eruption, which continued eight years, the walls\r\nfell in. Its craggy crest is still more Alpine than Caraguairazo; eight\r\nsnowy peaks shoot up like needles into the sky, and surround an altar to\r\nwhose elevated purity no mortal offering will ever attain. The trachyte\r\nwhich once formed the summit of this mountain is now spread in fragments\r\nover the plain of Riobamba.\r\n\r\nLeaving this broken-down volcano, but still the most picturesque in the\r\nAndes, we travel over the rough and rugged range of Cubillin, till our\r\nattention is arrested by terrific explosions like a naval broadside, and\r\na column of smoke that seems to come from the furnace of the Cyclops. It\r\nis Sangai, the most active volcano on the globe. From its unapproachable\r\ncrater, three miles high, it sends forth a constant stream of fire,\r\nwater, mud, and ashes.[91]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: La Condamine (1742) adds \"sulphur and bitumen.\"]\r\n\r\nNo intermission has been noticed since the Spaniards first saw it three\r\nhundred years ago. Stromboli is the only volcano that will compare with\r\nit. Its ashes are almost always falling on the city of Guayaquil, one\r\nhundred miles distant, and its explosions, generally occurring every\r\nhour or two, are sometimes heard in that city. Wisse, in 1849, counted\r\n267 explosions in one hour.\r\n\r\nWe have now completed the series. What an array of snow-clad peaks wall\r\nin the narrow Valley of Quito--Nature's Gothic spires to this her\r\nglorious temple! If ever there was a time when all these volcanoes were\r\nactive in concert, this secluded vale must have witnessed the most\r\nsplendid pyrotechnics conceivable. Imagine fifty mountains as high as\r\nEtna, three of them with smoking craters, standing along the road\r\nbetween New York and Washington, and you will have some idea of the ride\r\ndown this gigantic colonnade from Quito to Riobamba. If, as Ruskin says,\r\nthe elements of beauty are in proportion to the increase of mountainous\r\ncharacter, Ecuador is artistically beautiful to a high degree.\r\n\r\nHere, amid these Plutonic peaks, are the energies of volcanic action\r\nbest studied. The constancy of the volcanic fires is a striking fact.\r\nFirst we have the deluges of submarine lavas, which were poured out long\r\nbefore the Andes lifted their heads above the waters; then alternate\r\nporphyritic strata, feldspathic streams, and gypseous exhalations; then,\r\nat a later day, floods of basaltic lava; next the old tertiary\r\neruptions; and, lastly, the vast accumulations of boulders, gravel,\r\nashes, pumice, and mud of the present day, spread over the Valley of\r\nQuito and the west slope of the Cordilleras to an unknown depth beneath\r\nthe sea. The incessant eruptions of Sangai, and the frequent\r\nearthquakes, show that the subterranean energy which heaved the Andes is\r\nnot yet expended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n     The Valley of Quito.--Riobamba.--A Bed of \"Fossil Giants.\"--Chillo\r\n     Hacienda.--Otovalo and Ibarra.--The Great Earthquake of 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valley of Quito has about the same size and shape as the basin of\r\nSalt Lake, but it is five thousand feet higher.[92] The two cordilleras\r\ninclosing it are tied by the mountain-knots of Assuay and Chisinchi, so\r\nthat the valley is subdivided into three basins, those of Cuenca,\r\nAmbato, and Quito proper, which increase in beauty and altitude as we\r\ntravel north. There are several subordinate transversal dikes and some\r\nlongitudinal ridges, but all the basins lie parallel to the axes of the\r\ncordilleras--a characteristic feature of the Andes. The deep valleys on\r\nthe outside flanks are evidently valleys of erosion, but the basins\r\nbetween the cordilleras were created with them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Compare the table-lands in the Old World:\r\n\r\nThibet            11,500 feet.\r\nSouth Africa       6,000   \"\r\nMysore (India)     2,880   \"\r\nSpain              2,240   \"\r\nBavaria            1,770   \"\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first is fifty miles long. It contains the cities of Loja and\r\nCuenca,[93] the former distinguished for its cinchona forests, the\r\nlatter for Inca graves and mines of precious metals. The middle basin\r\n(130 miles in length) is covered with vast quantities of volcanic\r\ndébris, the outpourings of Cotopaxi, Tunguragua, and Altar, on one side,\r\nand of Chimborazo and Caraguairazo on the other. Nothing relieves the\r\nbarrenness of the landscape but hedges of century plant, cactus, and\r\nwild heliotrope, which border the roads. Whirlwinds of sand are often\r\nseen moving over the plain. The mean temperature is 61°.5. Here exist,\r\nwe can not say thrive, the cities of Riobamba, Ambato, and Tacunga,\r\nalready noticed. Riobamba,[94] properly Rayobamba, the plain of\r\nlightning, was founded at the beginning of this century, or shortly\r\nafter the destruction of the old city. Excepting the ecclesiastical\r\nbuildings, the houses are of one story, built of stone plastered with\r\nmud, sometimes of adobe or bamboo, and the windows are grated like those\r\nof a prison. As in all Spanish-American towns, the main church fronts\r\nthe great Plaza where the weekly fairs are held. Save on fair-day, the\r\ncity is lifeless. Nothing is exported to the coast except a few eggs and\r\nfowls, lard and potatoes. Such is the power of habit, an Indian will\r\ntake a hen to Bodegas and sell it for four reals (50 cents) when he\r\ncould get three for it in Riobamba, and six on the road. Another\r\ninstance of this dogged adherence to custom was related to us by Dr.\r\nTaylor: The Indians were accustomed to bring the curate of a certain\r\nvillage a bundle of alfalfa every day. A new curate, having no use for\r\nso much, ordered them not to bring any more. He was besieged by five\r\nhundred of his wild parishioners, and had he not been a powerful man,\r\nthey would have killed him. They told him they were accustomed to bring\r\nthe curate that much of alfalfa, and should continue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: The altitude of Loja is 6768 feet; of Cuenca, 8640 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: According to Villavicencio, _Rio_ (or _Rie_) is Quichua\r\nfor road; _bamba_ is plain.]\r\n\r\nOld Riobamba (Cajabamba) is situated twelve miles to the west. This has\r\nbeen the scene of some of the most terrible paroxysms that over shook\r\nthe Andes. In 1797 a part of Mount Cicalfa was thrown down, crushing the\r\ncity at its foot; hills arose where valleys existed; rivers\r\ndisappeared, and others took their places; and the very site of the\r\ncity was rent asunder. The surviving inhabitants could not tell where\r\ntheir houses had stood, and property was so mingled that litigation\r\nfollowed the earthquake. Judging from the numerous sculptured columns\r\nlying broken and prostrate throughout the valley, the city must have had\r\na magnificence now unknown in Ecuador. Around a coat of arms (evidently\r\nSpanish) we read these words: _Malo mori quam fedari_, \"I would rather\r\ndie than be disgraced.\" In the spring of 1868 another convulsion caused\r\na lake to disappear and a mountain to take its place.\r\n\r\nNear Punín, seven miles southwest of Riobamba, we discovered in a deep\r\nravine numerous fossil bones, belonging chiefly to the mastodon, and\r\nextinct species of the horse, deer, and llama. They were imbedded in the\r\nmiddle of an unstratified cliff, four hundred feet high, of very compact\r\nsilt or trachytic clay, free from stones, and resting on a hard\r\nquartzoze sandstone. In the bed of the stream which runs through the\r\nravine (charged with nitrate of soda) are some igneous rocks. The bones\r\nwere drifted to this spot and deposited (many of them in a broken state)\r\nin horizontal layers along with recent shells. We have, then, this\r\nremarkable fact, that this high valley was tenanted by elephantine\r\nquadrupeds, all of which passed away before the arrival of the human\r\nspecies, and yet while the land, and probably the sea also, were peopled\r\nwith their present molluscan inhabitants. This confirms the statement of\r\nMr. Lyell, that the longevity of mammalian species is much inferior to\r\nthat of the testacea. It is interesting to speculate on the probable\r\nclimate and the character of the vegetation in this high valley when\r\nthese extinct mammifers lived. The great pachyderm would have no\r\ndifficulty in thriving at the present day at Quito, on the score of\r\ntemperature or altitude. The mammoth once flourished in Siberia; and\r\nGibbon met an elephant on the high table-lands of Bolivia that had\r\nwalked over the Cordillera at the pass of Antarangua, sixteen thousand\r\nfeet above the sea. Darwin thinks that the climate of the Cordilleras\r\nhas changed since the pleistocene period. \"It is a marvelous fact in the\r\nhistory of mammalia (says this naturalist) that in South America a\r\nnative horse should have lived and disappeared, to be succeeded in after\r\nages by the countless herds descended from the few introduced with the\r\nSpanish colonists.\"\r\n\r\nThe high ridge of Chisinchi, stretching across the great plateau from\r\nCotopaxi to Iliniza, separates the evergreen Valley of Quito from the\r\narid and melancholy valleys of Cuenca and Ambato. It rolls out like a\r\nrich carpet of emerald verdure between the towering mountains of\r\nPichincha and Antisana, Cotacachi and Cayambi. This was the centre of\r\nthe most ancient native civilization after that of Titicaca. Here, while\r\nthe darkness of the Middle Ages was settling over Europe, dwelt the\r\nQuitus, whose origin is lost in the mists of fable. Then, while Peter\r\nthe Hermit was leading his fanatic host against the Saracens, the Cara\r\nnation waged a more successful crusade, and supplanted the Quitus. Here,\r\ntoo, in the bloody days of Pizarro, reigned, and was buried, the last of\r\nthe Incas, ill-fated Atahuallpa. To him, indeed, it was a more\r\ndelightful spot than the vale of Vilcamayu--the paradise of Peru.\r\n\r\nThe Puengasi Hills, running through the valley from north to south,\r\npartially divide the capital and its vicinity from the charming Valley\r\nof Chillo, spread out at the foot of Antisana. Here is the venerable\r\nhacienda of Chillo, where Humboldt and Bonpland resided for some time.\r\nIt is owned by the Aguirres, who are grand-nephews of Don Carlos\r\nMontufar, the companion of the famous travelers. The hacienda contains\r\ntwo valuable paintings--an original \"Crucifixion\" by Titian, and a\r\nportrait of the great German from life, as he appeared in 1803. This\r\nlatter relic interested us exceedingly, and, through the kindness of Sr.\r\nAguirre, we were allowed to photograph it. It represents Humboldt in his\r\nprime, a traveler on the Andes, dressed after the court-fashion of\r\nBerlin; very different from the usual portrait--an old man in his\r\nlibrary, his head, thinly covered with gray hair, resting on his bosom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Humboldt in 1802.]\r\n\r\nThirty miles north of Quito, near the volcanic Imbabura, is the ruined\r\ncity of Otovalo, a thousand feet lower than the capital. It was well\r\nbuilt, and contained 7000 inhabitants. Quichua was the prevailing\r\nlanguage. Its chief trade was in saddles, ponchos, straw hats, and\r\nfruit. Here was the cotton factory, or _quinta_, of Sr. Pareja. Three\r\nmiles from Otovalo was the enterprising Indian village of Cotocachí, at\r\nthe mountain of the same name. It was noted for its hand-loom products.\r\nA heap of ruins now marks the locality. It is a doomed spot, suffering\r\nmore than any other town in 1859.\r\n\r\nFour miles northwest of Otovalo was the city of Ibarra, picturesquely\r\nseated on a plain 2000 feet lower than Quito, and surrounded with\r\norchards and gardens. It numbered nearly 10,000 souls. It was not a\r\ncommercial place, but the residence of landed proprietors. The\r\nneighborhood produced cotton, sugar, and fruit. A league distant was\r\nCarranqui, the birthplace of Atahuallpa. And, finally, the great valley\r\nfitly terminates in the plain of Atuntaqui,[95] where the decisive\r\nbattle was fought which ushered in the reign of the Incas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ibarra.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Atuntaqui received its name from the big drum which was\r\nkept here in the days of Huayna-Capac, to give the war-signal.]\r\n\r\nThis northern province of Imbabura was the focus of the late terrible\r\nearthquake. At half past one on Sunday morning, August 16, 1868, with\r\nscarcely a premonitory sign (save a slight trembling at 3 P.M. the\r\nprevious day), there was an upheaving of the ground, and then one\r\ntremendous shock and rocking of the earth, lasting one minute. In that\r\nbrief moment the rich and flourishing province became a wilderness, and\r\n\"Misericordia!\" went up, like tho sound of many waters, from ten\r\nvillages and cities. Otovalo, Ibarra, Cotocachí, and Atantaqui are\r\nheaps of ruins. At Otovalo 6000 perished. After the first shock, not a\r\nwall a yard high remained. Houses, in some instances, seemed to have\r\nbeen cut from their foundation, and thrown ten feet distant. The large\r\nstone fountain in the Plaza was thrown many yards. The cotton factory,\r\nwhich was built on the edge of a ravine, was by one stroke reduced to\r\nfragments. Such was the force of the concussion, the looms smashed each\r\nother, the carding-machines were thrown on their sides, and the roof,\r\nwith part of the machinery, was found in the river below. The proprietor\r\nwas killed. Throughout this whole region roads were broken up, and vast\r\nchasms created crossing the country in all directions. One is 2000 yards\r\nlong, 500 yards broad, and 80 yards deep. Large fissures were opened on\r\nthe sides of Cotocachí and Imbabura, from which issued immense torrents\r\nof water, mud, and bituminous substances, carrying away and drowning\r\nhundreds of cattle. A caravan of mules going to Chillo with cotton-bales\r\nwas found four days after grazing on a narrow strip of land, on each\r\nside of which was a fearful chasm, while the muleteers were killed.\r\n\r\nAt Quito comparatively little damage was done. Fifteen lives were lost,\r\nand the churches, convents, and many private houses are in a state of\r\ndilapidation. Domes and arches, which are much used because of the\r\nscarcity of timber, were first to fall.\r\n\r\nIn the fierceness of the shock, and the extent of the territory shaken,\r\nthe earthquake of August, 1868, is without a parallel in the New World.\r\nThe destruction of life (50,000 officially reported in Ecuador alone)\r\nhas not been equaled in any other earthquake during this century. The\r\ntremor was felt over four republics, and from the Andes to the Sandwich\r\nIslands. The water-wave was felt on the coast of New Zealand sixteen\r\nhours after it had set a United States gunboat, on the sand-hills of\r\nArica. In some respects it is surpassed only by the Lisbon earthquake,\r\nwhich reached from Sweden to the West Indies, and from Barbary to\r\nScotland. The loss of property seems to have been greatest in Peru, and\r\nthe loss of life greatest in Ecuador. The commotion seemed to be most\r\nviolent along the Western Cordillera, though it was felt even on the\r\nNapo.\r\n\r\nThere are few places where the crust of our planet is long at rest.\r\nBrazil, Egypt, Russia, and Greenland are comparatively free from\r\nearthquakes. But had we delicate instruments scattered throughout the\r\nworld, upheaval and subsidence would doubtless be detected in every part\r\nof the so-called _terra firma_. The sea, and not the land, is the true\r\nimage of stability.\r\n\r\n    \"Time writes no wrinkle on thy azure brow:\r\n    Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.\"\r\n\r\nEarthquakes have occurred in every period of geological history, and are\r\nindependent of latitude. The first well-known earthquake came in the\r\nyear 63, and shattered Pompeii and Herculaneum sixteen years before they\r\nwere overwhelmed by the first recorded eruption of Vesuvius. The most\r\ncelebrated earthquake, and perhaps the most terrible manifestation of\r\nforce during the human period, was in 1755. The shock, which seemed to\r\noriginate in the bed of the Atlantic, pervaded one twelfth of the\r\nearth's surface. Unhappy Lisbon stood in its path.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake is a vertical vibration, having an undulatory progression.\r\nAn example of the simple bounding movement occurred in 1797, when the\r\ncity of Riobamba, in the Quito Valley, was buried under part of a\r\nmountain shaken down by the violent concussion, and men were tossed\r\nseveral hundred feet. We saw one massive structure which had nearly\r\nturned a somersault. The ordinary vibrations seldom exceed two feet in\r\nheight. The wave-movement has a rate of from twenty to thirty miles a\r\nminute, depending on the elasticity of the rock and the elevations on\r\nthe surface. When two undulations cross each other, a rotatory or\r\ntwisting motion is produced. The waves are generally transmitted along\r\nthe lines of primary mountain chains, which are doubtless seated on a\r\nfracture. The Lisbon waves moved from southwest to northeast, or\r\nparallel to the mountain system of the Old World; those of the United\r\nStates, in 1843, ran parallel to the volcanic chain in Mexico. In South\r\nAmerica they roll along the Andes. That of 1797 left its tracks along a\r\nwesterly line from Tunguragua through Peliléo and Guáno. It is a little\r\nsingular, that while the late trembling at Quito seemed to come from the\r\nnorth, the great shock in Peru preceded that in Ecuador by three days.\r\nThough the origin of earthquakes is deep-seated, the oscillation is\r\nmostly superficial, as deep mines are little disturbed. The most damage\r\nis done where the sedimentary plains abut against the hard, upturned\r\nstrata of the mountains. The shock is usually brief. That of Caracas\r\nlasted fifty seconds, that of Lisbon six minutes; but Humboldt witnessed\r\none in South America which continued a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nSeveral hypotheses have been advanced to account for earthquakes. Rogers\r\nascribes them to billowy pulsations in the molten matter upon which the\r\nflexible crust of the earth floats. Mallet thinks they may be viewed as\r\nan uncompleted effort to establish a volcano. Dana holds that they are\r\noccasioned by the folding up of the rocks in the slow process of cooling\r\nand consequent contraction of the earth's crust. In this process there\r\nwould occur enormous fractures to relieve the tension; tilted strata\r\nwould slip, and caverns give way. All this no doubt takes place; but the\r\nsudden, paroxysmal heavings incline us to refer the cause to the same\r\neruptive impulse which makes Vesuvius and Cotopaxi discharge pent-up\r\nsubterranean vapor and gas. The most destructive earthquakes occur when\r\nthe overlying rocks do not break and give vent to the imprisoned gas.\r\nThere is some connection between volcanoes and earthquakes; the former\r\nare, to a certain extent, \"safety-valves.\" The column of smoke from the\r\nvolcano of Pasto suddenly disappeared just before the great earthquake\r\nat Riobamba. In the spring of 1868 Pichincha and Cotopaxi showed signs\r\nof increasing activity, but in the summer became quiet again. Cotocachí\r\nand Sangai, 200 miles apart, were awaked simultaneously; the former,\r\nsilent for centuries, sent forth dense masses of earth and volcanic\r\nmatter to a distance of many miles, covering thousands of acres; the\r\nlatter thundered every half hour instead of hourly, as before. Still,\r\nthe greatest earthquakes do not occur in the vicinity of active\r\nvolcanoes. Lisbon and Lima (where, on an average, forty-five shocks\r\noccur annually, and two fearful ones in a century) are far distant from\r\nany volcanic vent; likewise Northern India, South Africa, Scotland, and\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake is beyond the reach of calculation. Professor Perrey, of\r\nDijon, France, is endeavoring to prove that there is a periodicity in\r\nearthquakes, synchronous with that in the tides of the ocean, the\r\ngreatest number occurring at the time of new and full moon.[96] If this\r\ntheory be sustained, we must admit the existence of a vast subterranean\r\nsea of lava. But all this is problematical. Earthquakes appear\r\nindependently of the geology of a country, though the rate of undulation\r\nis modified by the mineral structure. Earthquake waves seem to move more\r\nrapidly through the comparatively undisturbed beds of the Mississippi\r\nValley than through the contorted strata of Europe. Meteorology is\r\nunable to indicate a coming earthquake, for there is no sure prophecy in\r\nsultry weather, sirocco wind, and leaden sky. The Lisbon shock came\r\nwithout a warning. Sudden changes of the weather, however, often occur\r\nafter an earthquake. Since the great convulsion of 1797 the climate of\r\nthe Valley of Quito is said to be much colder. A heavy rain often\r\nfollows a violent earthquake in Peru.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Professor Quinby, of the University of Rochester, has, at\r\nour request, calculated the position of the moon at the late earthquake:\r\n\"August 16th, 1868, 1 A.M., the moon was on meridian 137° 21' east of\r\nthat of Quito, or 42° 30' past the lower meridian of Quito, assuming the\r\nlongitude of Quito west of Greenwich to be 79°, which it is very nearly.\r\nThis is but little after the vertex of the tidal wave should have passed\r\nthe meridian of Quito, on the supposition that the interior of the earth\r\nis a liquid mass. The age of the moon at that time was 27.36 days,\r\n_i.e._, it was only about two days before new moon.\" At the time of the\r\nearthquake, 8 A.M., March 22, 1859, the moon was on meridian 25° 48'\r\neast of that of Quito, and was 17.6 days old. Shocks have since\r\noccurred, March 20th at 3 A.M., and April 10th at 8 A.M., 1869.]\r\n\r\nNo amount of familiarity with earthquakes enables one to laugh during\r\nthe shock, or even at the subterranean thunders which sound like the\r\nclanking of chains in the realm of Pluto. All animated nature is\r\nterror-stricken. The horse trembles in his stall; the cow moans a low,\r\nmelancholy tune; the dog sends forth an unearthly yell; sparrows drop\r\nfrom the trees as if dead; crocodiles leave the trembling bed of the\r\nriver and run with loud cries into the forest; and man himself becomes\r\nbewildered and loses all capacity. When the earth rocks beneath our feet\r\n(the motion resembling, in the words of Darwin, \"that felt by a person\r\nskating over thin ice which bends under the weight of his body\"),\r\nsomething besides giddiness is produced. We feel our utter\r\ninsignificance in the presence of a mysterious power that shakes the\r\nAndes like a reed. But more: there is an awful sensation of insecurity.\r\n\"A moment (says Humboldt) destroys the illusion of a whole life: our\r\ndeceptive faith in the repose of nature vanishes, and we feel\r\ntransported, as it were, into a region of unknown destructive forces.\" A\r\njudgment day seems impending, and each moment is an age when one stands\r\non a world convulsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n     \"The Province of the Orient,\" or the Wild Napo Country.--The Napos,\r\n     Zaparos, and Jívaros Indians.--Preparations to cross the Continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the eastern slope of the Ecuadorian Andes, between the Marañon and\r\nits tributary the Putumayo, lies the Napo country. This almost unknown\r\nregion has the area of New York and New England together. The government\r\nof Quito, by a sonorous decree in 1854, baptized it \"La Provincia del\r\nOriente.\" Peru likewise claims it, but neither republic has done any\r\nthing to colonize it. A dense primeval forest, broken only by the\r\nrivers, covers the whole territory, and is the home of wild races\r\nuntouched by civilization.[97] There is not a road in the whole\r\nprovince. A footpath, open only in the dry season, and barely passable\r\nthen, connects Quito and the Rio Napo. Congress lately promised to put\r\nCanélos in communication with the capital; but the largest villages in\r\nthis vast and fertile region--Archidona, Canélos, and Macás--still\r\nremain isolated from the outer world.[98] Ecuador once appointed a\r\nfunctionary under the high-sounding title of \"Governor of the Orient,\"\r\nwith a salary of $700; but now the Indians are not troubled with any\r\nhigher official than an alcalde.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: The boundary-line between Ecuador and Peru is about as\r\nindefinite as the eastern limit of Bolivia, Brazilians claiming \"as far\r\nwest as the cattle of the empire roam.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Quito might be made more accessible on the Atlantic than\r\non the Pacific side. But Ecuadorians dote on Guayaquil, and refuse to\r\nconnect themselves directly with the great nations of the East. We\r\nbelieve there is a glorious future for Quito, when it will once more\r\nbecome a city of palaces. But it will not come until a road through the\r\nwilderness and a steamer on the Napo open a short communication with the\r\nwealth of Amazonia and the enterprise of Europe.]\r\n\r\nThe country is very thinly inhabited. The chief tribes are the\r\nsemi-Christianized Napos (sometimes called Quijos), dwelling on the\r\nnorth bank of the Napo; the peaceful but uncivilized Zaparos, living\r\nbetween the Napo and Pastassa, and the warlike Jívaros, spread over the\r\nunexplored region between the Pastassa and Santiago.\r\n\r\nThese oriental tribes would probably be assigned by D'Orbigny to the\r\nAntisian branch of the Alpine races of South America. Dwelling amid the\r\ndarkness of primeval forests, and on the gloomy banks of mountain\r\ntorrents, they have acquired modifications of character, physical and\r\nmoral, which distinguish them from the natives of the high and open\r\nregions, or the steaming lowlands of the Amazon. In color, however, they\r\ndo not appear to us to be entitled to the name of \"white men;\" they\r\napproach nearer to the bronze complexion of the Quichuans than the\r\nyellow cast of the Brazilians. We see no evidence of that \"bleaching\r\nprocess\" resulting from a life under the dense canopy of foliage of\r\nwhich the learned French naturalist speaks, neither did we perceive the\r\nforce of his statement that the color of the South American bears a very\r\ndecided relation to the humidity of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe features of the Napo Indians are Quichuan, especially the low\r\nforehead, squarely-built face, and dull expression; but in stature they\r\nexceed the mountaineers. From a skull in our possession we take the\r\nfollowing measurements, adding for comparison the dimensions of an\r\nancient Peruvian cranium in Dr. Morton's collection:\r\n\r\n                                 Napo.              Peruvian.\r\n\r\nLongitudinal diameter            6-1/2   in.         6.1 in.\r\nParietal        \"                5-3/8   \"           6.  \"\r\nFrontal         \"                4       \"           4.7 \"\r\nVertical        \"                4-1/2   \"           5.5 \"\r\nCapacity                        83-1/64 cub. in.    83 cub. in.\r\nFacial angle                    70°                 81°\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that the capacity of this individual Napo is 8\r\ncubic inches greater than the average bulk (75 cubic inches) of the old\r\nPeruvians; a trifle less than the average North American (84); 10 cubic\r\ninches less than the European (94); and the same as the average\r\nPolynesian and native African. He has a rounded head, somewhat prominent\r\nvertex, not an excessive protuberance of brain behind--a line through\r\nthe meatus dividing it into very nearly equal parts; but a narrow front\r\nas viewed from above, small vertical diameter, quadrangular orbits,\r\nvertical teeth, and low facial angle. These characters place him between\r\nthe Toltecan and the more barbarous tribes of the New World.\r\n\r\nThe Napos are nominally subject to the Ecuadorian government, which is\r\nrepresented by three or four petty alcaldes; but the Jesuit\r\nmissionaries, who have established a bishopric and three curacies,\r\ngenerally control affairs--spiritual, political, and commercial. The\r\nIndians of each village annually elect one of their number governor, who\r\nserves without salary, and whose only show of authority is a\r\nsilver-headed cane about four feet long. He is attended by half a dozen\r\n\"justices,\" whose duty it is to supply the curate, alcalde, and any\r\ntraveling _blanco_ who may happen to be in town with daily food at a\r\nreasonable rate.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Napos is a mixture of Paganism and Christianity. In\r\ncommon with all the other orient tribes, they believe in good and evil\r\nprinciples, and in metempsychosis. They swear in the name of the devil.\r\nThey bury their dead horizontally, in a coffin made of a part of a\r\ncanoe, with a lid of bamboo. They are very kind to the aged. Monogamy is\r\nthe rule: the usual age of wedlock is sixteen or seventeen. The parents\r\nnegotiate the marriage, and the curate's fee is one castellano ($3.50).\r\nWhen a person dies they hold an Irish \"wake\" over the body, and then\r\ntake the widow to the river and wash her. They have seven semi-religious\r\nfeasts in a year. To us they appeared to be nothing more than\r\nmeaningless drunken frolics. Attired in their best, with head-dresses\r\nconsisting of a circlet of short, richly-colored feathers from the\r\nbreast of the toucan, surmounted with the long tail-feathers of the\r\nmacaw, and with necklaces of beads, seeds, and monkeys' teeth, they keep\r\nup a constant monotonous tapping on little drums, and trot around a\r\ncircle like dogs on a treadmill, stopping only to drink chicha. This is\r\nkept up for three weeks, when they all start off, with wives and\r\nchildren, for the forest to hunt monkeys for meat.\r\n\r\nChicha, the favorite drink of all the Andean Indians, is here brewed\r\nfrom yuca, not from corn and barley as in the Quito Valley. So true is\r\nit, as Humboldt remarks, that almost every where man finds means of\r\npreparing some kind of beverage from the vegetable kingdom. The\r\nChilotans, Darwin informs us, make chicha from a species of _Bromelia_.\r\nIn every zone, too, we find nations in a low degree of civilization\r\nliving almost exclusively upon a single animal or plant. Thus the\r\nLaplander has his reindeer, the Esquimaux his seal, the Sandwich\r\nIslander his tara-root, the Malay his sago-palm, the Napo Indian his\r\nyuca.\r\n\r\nYuca is the staple food in this region. It is more commonly roasted, but\r\nis sometimes ground into flour. The manufacture of chicha is primitive,\r\nand not a little disgusting. A \"bee,\" usually old women, sit around a\r\nwooden trough; each one takes a mouthful of yuca root, and, masticating\r\nit, throws it into the trough. The mass is then transferred to large\r\nearthen jars containing water, and left to ferment. The liquor is\r\nslightly acid, but not intoxicating unless taken in excess. This is done\r\non feast-days, when the poor Indian keeps his stomach so constantly\r\ndistended for weeks that the abdominal protrusion is not only\r\nunsightly, but alarming to a stranger. Chicha-drinking is a part of the\r\nworship of these simple aborigines. They seem to think that the more\r\nhappy they make themselves while paying their devotions to the Creator,\r\nthe better he is satisfied. The Jesuits have found it impossible to\r\nchange this method of praise. Here, as among all rude nations, an\r\nancient custom is one half the religion. In eating meat (usually monkey,\r\nsea-cow, and peccari), we observed that they did not tear or bite it,\r\nbut, putting one end of a long piece in the mouth, cut off what they\r\ncould not get in, as Darwin noticed among the Fuegians. They keep no\r\ndomestic animals except fowls.\r\n\r\nAs to dress, they make use of a coarse cotton cloth, called _lienzo_,\r\nwoven by the more enlightened Indians of Quito, dyeing it a dull brown\r\nby means of achote juice. The men wear a strip of this around the loins,\r\nand the women a short skirt. On feast-days, or when musquitoes are\r\nthick, the men add a little poncho and pantaloons. They do not properly\r\ntattoo, but color the skin with achote or anatto. This substance, which\r\nserves so many purposes in this part of the world, is the red powder\r\nwhich covers the seeds contained in the prickly bur of the _Bixa\r\norellana_. The pigment is an article of commerce on the Amazon, and is\r\nexported to Europe, where it is used for coloring butter, cheese, and\r\nvarnish. They have no fixed pattern; each paints to suit his fancy.\r\nUsually, however, they draw horizontal bands from the month to the ears,\r\nand across the forehead; we never saw curved lines in which higher\r\nsavages, like the Tahitians, tattoo.\r\n\r\nThe Napos have the provoking apathy of all the New World aborigines. As\r\nHumboldt observed of another tribe, \"their poverty, stoicism, and\r\nuncultivated state render them so rich and so free from wants of every\r\nkind, that neither money nor other presents will induce them to turn\r\nthree steps out of their ways.\" They maintain a passive dignity in their\r\nbearing not seen in the proudest pope or emperor. They seldom laugh or\r\nsmile, even under the inspiration of chicha, and months of intercourse\r\nwith them did not discover to us the power of song, though Villavicencio\r\nsays they do sometimes intone fragments of prose in their festival\r\norgies. They manifest little curiosity, and little power of mimicry, in\r\nwhich wild men generally excel the civilized.[99] The old Spartans were\r\nnever so laconic. In conversation each says all he has to say in three\r\nor four words till his companion speaks, when he replies in the same\r\ncurt, ejaculatory style. A long sentence, or a number of sentences at\r\none time, we do not remember of hearing from the lips of a Napo\r\nIndian.[100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: All savages appear to possess to an uncommon degree the\r\npower of mimicry.--_Darwin_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Gibbon observes of his Indian paddlers on the Marmoré:\r\n\"They talk very little; they silently pull along as though they were\r\nsleeping, but their eyes are wandering all the time in every\r\ndirection.\"]\r\n\r\nThe women do most of the work, while their lazy lords drink up the\r\nchicha and swing in their hammocks, or possibly do a little\r\nhunting.[101] They catch fish with bone hooks, seines, spears, and by\r\npoisoning the water with _barbasco_.[102] This last method is quite\r\ncommon throughout equatorial America. Mashing the root, they throw it\r\ninto the quiet coves of the river, when almost immediately the fish rise\r\nto the surface, first the little fry and then the larger specimens. The\r\npoison seems to stupefy rather than kill, for we observed that some\r\nindividuals behaved in a most lively manner shortly after they were\r\ncaught. The Indians drink the water with impunity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Some of these feminines, however, have a method of\r\nretaliation which happily does not exist further north. They render\r\ntheir husbands idiotic by giving them an infusion of _floripondio_, and\r\nthen choose another consort. We saw a sad example of this near Riobamba,\r\nand heard of one husband who, after being thus treated, unconsciously\r\nserved his wife and her new man like a slave. _Floripondio_ is the seed\r\nof the _Datura sanguinea_, which is allied to the poisonous _stramonium_\r\nused by the priests of Apollo at Delphi to produce their frantic\r\nravings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: _Jacquinia armillaris_, an evergreen bush. The Indians on\r\nthe Tapajos use a poisonous liana called _timbó_ (_Paullinia pinnata_).]\r\n\r\nThe Napos are not brave; their chief weapons for hunting are spears of\r\nchonta wood, and blowpipes (_bodaqueras_) made of a small palm having a\r\npith, which, when removed, leaves a polished bore, or of two separate\r\nlengths of wood, each scooped out with patient labor and considerable\r\nskill by means of the incisor teeth of a rodent. The whole is smeared\r\nwith black wax, a mouth-piece fitted to the larger end, and a sight made\r\nof bone imbedded in the wax. Through this tube, about ten feet long,\r\nthey blow slender arrows cut from the leaf-stalks of a palm. These are\r\nwinged with a tuft of silk-cotton (common cotton would be too heavy),\r\nand poisoned with _urarí_, of which we shall speak hereafter. This\r\nnoiseless gun is universally used on the Upper Amazon.[103]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: It is there called _zarabatana_ or _gravatana_; by the\r\nPeruvians _pucuna_. It corresponds to the _sumpitan_ of Borneo. It is\r\ndifficult to recognize the use of the blow-gun, but the natives will\r\nkill at the distance of 150 feet. One which we brought home sent the\r\nslender arrow through the panel of a door.]\r\n\r\nThe Zaparos in physiognomy somewhat resemble the Chinese, having a\r\nmiddle stature, round face, small eyes set angularly, and a broad, flat\r\nnose. Their language is of simple construction, but nasal and guttural.\r\nThey have no words for numbers above three, but show their fingers;\r\nabove ten they know nothing. They take to themselves single names, not\r\ndouble. They reckon time by moons and the ripening of certain fruits.\r\nTheir name for God is Piátzo, but we could not learn that it conveyed\r\nany distinct idea. They believe the evil spirit, \"Mungia,\" is a black\r\nspectre dwelling in the woods. They think the souls of the good and\r\nbrave enter beautiful birds and feed on delicious fruits, while cowardly\r\nsouls become dirty reptiles. Polygamy is common. They bury in the\r\nsitting posture, with the hammock of the deceased wrapped around him.\r\nThe very old men are buried with the mouth downward. They make use of a\r\nnarcotic drink called _Ayahuasca_, which produces effects similar to\r\nthose of opium. The Zaparos are pacific and hospitable, but there is\r\nlittle social life among them; they never cluster into large villages,\r\nbut inhabit isolated ranchos. Nomadic in their habits, they wander along\r\nthe banks of the Napo, between the Andes and the Marañon. They\r\nmanufacture, from the twisted fibre of the chambiri-palm,[104] most of\r\nthe twine and hammocks seen in Eastern Ecuador. Their government is\r\npatriarchal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: This thorny palm is called _tucum_ in Brazil. The fibres\r\nof the budding top are used. A woman will twist a hundred yards of twine\r\na day, and make a living by selling hammocks for twenty-five cents a\r\npiece.]\r\n\r\nThe Jívaros, or \"Red Indians\" _par excellence_, are the most numerous\r\nand the most spirited of the oriental tribes. They are brave and\r\nresentful, yet hospitable and industrious. While the Napos and Zaparos\r\nlive in rude, often temporary huts of split bamboo, the warlike Jívaros\r\nerect houses of hard wood with strong doors. Blood relations live\r\ntogether on the communal principle, the women keeping the rear half of\r\nthe house, which is divided by a partition. Many Jívaros approach the\r\nCaucasian type, the beard and lighter skin hinting a percentage of\r\nSpanish blood; for this tribe was never conquered by the Incas, nor did\r\nit brook Spanish avarice and cruelty, but in one terrible conflict\r\n(1599) the intruder was swept out of existence. The wives of the El\r\nDorado adventurers spent the rest of their days in the harems of the\r\nJívaros. These Indians have the singular custom and art of compressing\r\nthe heads of their notable captives; taking off the skin entire and\r\ndrying it over a small mould, they have a hideous mummy which preserves\r\nall the features of the original face, but on a reduced scale.\"[105]\r\nThey also braid the long black hair of their foes into girdles, which\r\nthey wear as mementoes of their prowess. They use chonta-lances with\r\ntriangular points, notched and poisoned, and shields of wood or hide.\r\nThey have a telegraphic system which enables them to concentrate their\r\nforces quickly in time of war; large drums are placed on the tops of the\r\nhills, and a certain number of strokes, repeated along the line, rapidly\r\nconvey intelligence to the most distant habitation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Bates (ii., 132) speaks of a similar custom among the\r\nancient Mundurucus: \"They used to sever the head with knives made of\r\nbroad bamboo, and then, after taking out the brain and fleshy parts,\r\nsoak it in bitter vegetable oils, and expose it several days over the\r\nsmoke of a fire, or in the sun.\"]\r\n\r\nAn odd custom prevails among these wild Indians when an addition is made\r\nto the family circle. The woman goes into the woods alone, and on her\r\nreturn washes herself and new-born babe in the river; then the husband\r\nimmediately takes to his bed for eight days, during which time the wife\r\nserves him on the choicest dainties she can procure.[106] They have also\r\nthe unique practice of exchanging wives. The Jívaro speech is sonorous\r\nand energetic. They do not use salt; so that they distinguish the Napo\r\ntribes as the \"Indians who eat salt.\" The chief articles manufactured by\r\nthem are cotton goods and blowpipes. They trade mostly at Canélos and\r\nMacás, generally purchasing iron implements, such as hatchets and\r\nknives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: A like custom existed among some Brazilian and Guiana\r\ntribes. It also prevailed to some extent among the ancient Cantabrians\r\nand Corsicans, the Congos and Tartars, and in the Southern French\r\nprovinces.]\r\n\r\nCanélos consists of about seventy families of Quichua-speaking Indians,\r\nand lies on the south bank of the Bobonaza. A trail connects it with\r\nBaños, at the foot of Tunguragua. Canélos was founded in 1536, and\r\nderives its name from its situation in the Canéla, or American cinnamon\r\nforest. The bark of the tree has the flavor of the Ceylon aromatic;\r\nbut, according to Dr. Taylor, it is cassia. Macás, in the days of\r\nSpanish adventure a prosperous city under the name of \"Sevilla de Oro,\"\r\nis now a cluster of huts on the banks of the Upano. Its trade is in\r\ntobacco, vanilla, canela, wax, and copal. The Spaniards took the trouble\r\nto transplant some genuine cinnamon-trees from Ceylon to this locality,\r\nand they flourished for a time.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of October we left Quito on our march across the continent,\r\nby the way of the Napo wilderness. The preparations for our departure,\r\nhowever, commenced long before that date. To leave Quito in any\r\ndirection is the work of time. But to plunge into that _terra incognita_\r\n\"el Oriente,\" where for weeks, perhaps months, we should be lost to the\r\ncivilized world and cut off from all resources, east or west, demanded\r\nmore calculation and providence than a voyage round the world.\r\n\r\nWe were as long preparing for our journey to the Amazon as in making it.\r\nIn the first place, not a man in Quito could give us a single item of\r\ninformation on the most important and dangerous part of our route.\r\nQuitonians are not guilty of knowing any thing about trans-Andine\r\naffairs or \"oriental\" geography. From a few petty traders who had, to\r\nthe amazement of their fellow-citizens, traversed the forest and reached\r\nthe banks of the Napo, we gleaned some information which was of service.\r\nBut on the passage down the Napo from Santa Rosa to the Marañon, a\r\ndistance of over five hundred miles, nobody had any thing to say except\r\nthe delightful intelligence that in all probability, if we escaped the\r\nfever, we would be murdered by the savages. The information we received\r\nwas about as definite and reliable as Herndon obtained respecting any\r\ntributary to the Lower Amazon: \"It runs a long way up: it has rapids;\r\nsavages live upon its banks; every thing grows there.\" From M. Gillette,\r\na Swiss gentleman trading at Pará in Moyabamba hats, we learned about\r\nthe movements of the Peruvian steamer on the Marañon; but how long it\r\nwould take us to cross the mountains and the forest, and descend the\r\nriver, we must find out by trial.\r\n\r\nThe commissary department was of primal importance. As, from all we\r\ncould learn, we could not depend upon obtaining supplies from the\r\nIndians or with our guns,[107] it was necessary to take provisions to\r\nlast till we should reach the Marañon. But how long we should be in the\r\nforest and on the river, or what allowance to make for probable delays,\r\nit was impossible to prophesy. The utmost caution and forethought were\r\ntherefore needed, for to die of starvation in the wilderness was, for\r\nall practical purposes, equivalent to falling into the hands of\r\ncannibals. As it turned out, however, we made a most fortunate hit, for\r\non arriving at Pebas--the first village on the Marañon--we found we had\r\njust enough solid food left to have one grand jubilee dinner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: The scarcity of game is well illustrated by the fate of\r\nPizarro and his comrades. In returning from their expedition to the Napo\r\ncountry, they nearly perished with hunger, living on lizards, dogs,\r\nhorses, saddles, sword-belts, etc., and reached Quito looking more like\r\nspectres than men.]\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of future travelers, and for the curiosity of others, we\r\ngive the bill of fare we provided for this journey--stomachs, five;\r\ntime, forty-two days:\r\n\r\nFlour           100 lbs.\r\nCorn meal        27  \"\r\nPea flour        30  \"\r\nMashka           47  \"\r\nCrackers        100  \"\r\nRice             50  \"\r\nSugar            90  \"\r\nChocolate        25  \"\r\nDried meat[108]  47  \"\r\nSalt             10  \"\r\nLard             10  \"\r\nCream tartar   1-1/2 \"\r\nSoda              1  \"\r\nTea               2  \"\r\nHam              10  \"\r\nTamarinds         9  \"\r\nEggs            170.\r\nAnisado      pts. 5.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: \"Jerked beef,\" as it is called in South America, consists\r\nof thin strips cut off the carcass after skinning and dried in the sun.\r\nThe butchers do not distinguish between sirloin and round.]\r\n\r\nTo this we added by purchase from the Indians a few chickens and eggs,\r\nfive gallons of sirup, and a peck of rice; and on the river we helped\r\nourselves to a little wild game, as fish, peccari, deer, and turtles'\r\neggs. But these made only a drop in the commissary bucket; had we\r\ndepended upon finding provisions on the road, we must have perished from\r\nsheer hunger. Game, in the dry season, is exceedingly scarce. Our\r\nprovisions were packed in kerosene cans, a part of which were soldered\r\nup to keep out moisture (for the Valley of the Napo is a steaming\r\nvapor-bath) and to keep out the hands of Indians. More than once have\r\nthese treacherous yet indispensable guides robbed the white man of his\r\nfood, and then left him to his fate; we lost not a pound by theft. A\r\nfour-gallon keg of aguardiente,[109] from which we dealt out half a gill\r\ndaily to each man, kept our Indians in good humor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: This is the rum of the Andes, corresponding to the\r\n_cashaça_ of Brazil. It is distilled from sugar-cane. When\r\ndouble-distilled and flavored with anise, it is called _anisado_.]\r\n\r\nAs we must ascend to the cold altitude of fifteen thousand feet, and\r\nthen descend to the hot Valley of the Amazon, we were obliged to carry\r\nboth woolen and cotton garments, besides rubber ponchos to shield them\r\nfrom the rain by day, and to form the first substratum of our bed at\r\nnight. Two suits were needed in our long travel afoot through the\r\nforest; one kept dry for the nightly bivouac, the other for day service.\r\nAt the close of each day's journey we doffed every thread of our wearing\r\napparel, and donned the reserved suit, for we were daily drenched either\r\nfrom the heavens above or by crossing swollen rivers and seas of mud.\r\nThen, too, as boots would not answer for such kind of travel, we must\r\ntake _alpargates_, a native sandal made of the aloe fibre, and of these\r\nnot a few, for a pair would hardly hold together two days. Two bales of\r\n_lienzo_, besides knives, fish-hooks, thread, beads, looking-glasses,\r\nand other trinkets, were also needed; for the Napo Indians must be paid\r\nin such currency. There _lienzo_, not gold and silver, is the cry. On\r\nthis we made a small but lawful profit, paying in Quito eighteen cents\r\nper yard, and charging on the river twenty-five.\r\n\r\nAn extensive culinary apparatus, guns and ammunition, taxidermal and\r\nmedicinal chests, physical instruments, including a photographic\r\nestablishment, rope, macheta, axe, saw, nails, candles, matches, and a\r\nthousand _et cætera_, completed our outfit. Among the essential _et\r\ncætera_ were generous passports and mandatory letters from the President\r\nof Ecuador and the Peruvian Chargé d'Affaires, addressed to all\r\nauthorities on the Napo and the Marañon. They were obligingly procured\r\nfor us by Señor Hurtado, the Chilian minister (then acting for the\r\nUnited States), through the influence of a communication from our own\r\ngovernment, and were of great value to the expedition.[110]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: The following is a copy of the President's order:\r\n\r\n     REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR\r\n\r\nMinisteria de Estado        }             Quito á 18 de Octubre,}\r\nen el Despacho del Interior.}             de 1807.              }\r\n\r\n     APERTORIA.\r\n\r\n     A las autoridades del transito hasta el Napo, i á los demas\r\n     empleados civiles i militares de la provincia del Oriente:\r\n\r\n     El Sor.

From the capital to this point there is a path\r\njust passable for horses; but thence to the Napo travelers must take to\r\ntheir feet. Through the intervention of the curate of Papallacta, who\r\nhas great influence over his wild people, but who has wit enough to\r\nreside in Quito instead of his parish, we engaged the Indian governor to\r\nsend over thirteen beasts and three peons to carry our party and baggage\r\nto Papallacta. Wednesday morning the quadrupeds were at the door of our\r\nhotel, five of them _bestias de silla_. These horses, judging by size,\r\ncolor, shape, and bony prominences, were of five different species. The\r\nsaddles, likewise, differed from one another, and from any thing we had\r\never seen or desired to see. One of them was so narrow and deep none of\r\nus could get into it; so, filling up the cavity with blankets, we took\r\nturns in riding on the summit. By noon, October 30th, we had seen our\r\nAndean collections in the hands of arrieros bound for Guayaquil, whence\r\nthey were to be shipped by way of Panama to Washington, and our baggage\r\ntrain for Napo headed toward the rising sun. So, mounting our jades, we\r\ndefiled across the Grand Plaza and through the street of St. Augustine,\r\nand down the Carniceria to the Alameda, amid the _vivas_ and _adeos_ of\r\nour Quitonian friends, who turned out to see the largest expedition\r\nthat ever left the city for the wild Napo country since the days of\r\nPizarro. Few there were who expected to hear of our safe arrival on the\r\nshores of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nCrossing the magnificent plain of Iñaquito, we reached in an hour the\r\nromantic village of Guápulo. Here is an elegant stone church dedicated\r\nto the Virgin of Guadaloupe, to which the faithful make an annual\r\npilgrimage. Thence the road led us through the valley of the\r\nGuaillabamba (a tributary to the Esmeraldas), here and there blessed\r\nwith signs of intelligent life--a mud hut, and little green fields of\r\ncane and alfalfa, and dotted with trees of wild cherry and myrtle, but\r\nhaving that air of sadness and death-like repose so inseparable from a\r\nQuitonian landscape. The greater part of this day's ride was over a\r\nrolling country so barren and dreary it was almost repulsive. What a\r\npity the sun shines on so much useless territory!\r\n\r\nJust before sunset we arrived at Itulcachi, a great cattle estate at the\r\nfoot of the eastern chain of mountains. The hacienda had seen better\r\ndays, and was poorly fitted to entertain man or beast. The major-domo,\r\nhowever, managed to make some small potato soup, and find us shelter for\r\nthe night. In the room allotted us there were three immense\r\nkneading-troughs and two bread-boards to match, for a grist-mill and\r\nbakery were connected with the establishment. In default of beds, we\r\nmade use of this furniture. Five wiser men have slept in better berths,\r\nbut few have slept more soundly than we did in the bread-trays of\r\nItulcachi.\r\n\r\nThe following day we advanced five miles to Tablon, an Indian hamlet on\r\nthe mountain side. Here we waited over night for our cargo train, which\r\nhad loitered on the road. This was the only spot in South America where\r\nwe found milk to our stomachs' content; Itulcachi, with its herds of\r\ncattle, did not yield a drop. Our dormitory was a mud hovel, without an\r\naperture for light or ventilation, and in this dark hole we all slept on\r\na heap of barley. Splendid was the view westward from Tablon. Below us\r\nwere the beautiful valleys of Chillo and Puembo, separated by the\r\nisolated mountain of Ilaló; around them, in an imposing semicircle,\r\nstood Cayambi, Imbabura, Pichincha, Corazon, Iliniza, Rumiñagui,\r\nCotopaxi, Sincholagua, and Antisana. As the sun went down in his glory\r\nbehind the western range, the rocky head of Pichincha stood out in bold\r\nrelief, and cast a long shadow over the plain. At this halting-place we\r\nmade the mortifying discovery that the bare-legged Indian who had\r\ntrotted by our side as a guide and body-servant, and whom we had ordered\r\nabout with all the indifference of a surly slaveholder, was none other\r\nthan his Excellency Eugenio Mancheno, governor of Papallacta! After this\r\nwe were more respectful.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, our baggage having come up, we pushed up the mountain\r\nthrough a grand ravine, and over metamorphic rocks standing on their\r\nedges with a wavy strike, till we reached a polylepis grove, 12,000 feet\r\nabove the sea. We lunched under the wide-spreading branches of these\r\ngnarled and twisted trees, which reminded us of the patriarchal olives\r\nin the Garden of Gethsemane, and then, ascending over the monotonous\r\nparamo, we stood at the elevation of 15,000 feet on the narrow summit of\r\nthe Guamani ridge. Some priest had been before us and planted a cross by\r\nthe roadside, to guide and bless the traveler on his way.\r\n\r\nOf the magnificent prospect eastward, over the beginning of the\r\nAmazonian Valley, which this lofty point commands, we have already\r\nspoken. There was a wild grandeur in the scene--mountain behind\r\nmountain, with deep intervening valleys, all covered with one thick,\r\nunbroken mass of foliage. A tiny brook, the child of everlasting snows\r\nstill higher up, murmured at our feet, as if to tell us that we were on\r\nthe Atlantic slope, and then dashed into the great forest, to lose\r\nitself in the mighty Amazon, and be buried with it in the same ocean\r\ngrave. The trade-wind, too, came rushing by us fresh from that sea of\r\ncommerce which laves the shores of two worlds. Guamani gave us also our\r\nfinest view of Antisana, its snow-white dome rising out of a wilderness\r\nof mountains, and presenting on the north side a profile of the human\r\nface divine.\r\n\r\nAnd now we rapidly descended by a steep, narrow path, and over paramo\r\nand bog, to a little tambo, where we had the luxury of sleeping on a bed\r\nof straw. Here we made the acquaintance of two Indians from the Napo,\r\nwho were on the way to Quito with the mail--probably half a dozen\r\nletters. A strip of cloth around the loins, and a short cape just\r\ncovering the shoulders, were all their habiliments. We noticed that they\r\nnever sat down, though a bench was close by them; they would squat for\r\nan hour at a time. The day following we took our last horseback ride in\r\nSouth America. It was short, but horrible. Through quagmire and swamp,\r\nand down a flight of rocky stairs, in striking imitation of General\r\nPutnam's famous ride--over rocks, too, made wondrously slippery by a\r\npitiless rain, but which our unshod Indian horses descended with great\r\ndexterity, only one beast and his rider taking a somerset--thus we\r\ntraveled two hours, reaching Papallacta at 11 A.M.\r\n\r\nWe put up at the governor's. This edifice, the best in town, had sides\r\nof upright poles stuccoed with mud, a thatched roof, and ground floor,\r\non which, between three stones, a fire was built for cookery and\r\ncomfort. Three or four earthen kettles, and as many calabashes and\r\nwooden spoons, were the sum total of kitchen utensils. A large flat\r\nstone, with another smaller one to rub over it, was the mill for\r\ngrinding corn; and we were astonished to see how quickly our hostess\r\nreduced the grains to an impalpable meal. The only thing that looked\r\nlike a bed was a stiff rawhide thrown over a series of round poles\r\nrunning lengthwise. This primitive couch, and likewise the whole house,\r\nthe obsequious governor gave up to us, insisting upon sleeping with his\r\nwife and little ones outside, though the nights were cold and\r\nuncomfortable. Parents and children were of the earth, earthy--unwashed,\r\nuncombed, and disgustingly filthy. We found the governor one day taking\r\nlice for his lunch. Sitting behind his little boy, he picked out the\r\nlittle parasites with his nails, and crushed them between his teeth with\r\na look of satisfaction. Eating lice is an old Indian custom, and\r\nuniversal in the Andes. In Inca times it was considered an infallible\r\nremedy against sore eyes. We have seen half a dozen women sitting on the\r\nground in a row, picking out vermin from each other's heads. We thought\r\nthe arrangement was a little unfair, for the first in the series had no\r\nlice to eat, and the animals were left to roam undisturbed in the\r\ncapillary forest of the last.\r\n\r\nPapallacta is a village of thirty dwellings, situated in a deep valley\r\non the north slope of Antisana, nearly surrounded by an amphitheatre of\r\nsandstone and basaltic precipices. Here, too, is the terminus of the\r\nfourth great lava stream from the volcano; it is not mentioned by\r\nHumboldt. Papallacta is a thousand feet higher than Quito, yet\r\nvegetation is more tropical. Its name signifies \"the potato country,\"\r\nbut not a potato could we find here. Though Mancheno was governor, he\r\nwas not really the greatest man in Papallacta. This was Carlos\r\nCaguatijo; he was the ruling man, for he could read, write, and speak\r\nSpanish, while the governor knew nothing but Quichua. Carlos, moreover,\r\nwas a good man; he had an honest, Quaker-like air about him, and his\r\nface reminded us of George Washington's. In all his transactions we\r\nnoticed no attempt to prevaricate or deceive; what he promised he\r\nperformed to the letter. It was refreshing to meet one such upright soul\r\nin Ecuador, though we found him not of Caucasian blood, nor dwelling\r\nunder the tiled roofs of the proud capital. The old man was the\r\nspiritual father of Papallacta, and, in the absence of the curate,\r\nofficiated in the little church. With him, therefore, and not with our\r\nhost the governor, we negotiated for peons to take us through the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThe journey from Papallacta to the Napo occupied us thirteen days,\r\nincluding four days of rest. It was performed on foot, for the \"road\" is\r\na trail. But the untraveled reader can have little idea of a trail in a\r\ntropical forest: fording bridgeless rivers, wading through interminable\r\nbogs, fens, marshes, quagmires, and swamps, and cutting one's way\r\nthrough dense vegetation, must be done to be understood. Half the year\r\nthere is no intercourse between Quito and its Oriental province, for the\r\nincessant heavy rains of summer swell every rivulet into a furious\r\ntorrent, and the path is overgrown and rendered impassable even by an\r\nIndian. The only time for travel is between November and April, for\r\nthen, though it rains nearly every day, the clouds drop down in showers,\r\nnot floods. But even then the traveler must sometimes wait two or three\r\nweeks beside a swollen river in imminent danger of starving, and\r\nthroughout the journey entertain the comforting prospect that his\r\nIndians may eat up his provisions to lighten their load, or suddenly\r\ndesert him as they did Dr. Jameson. There are other routes across South\r\nAmerica much more feasible than the one we chose; these will be\r\ndescribed in Chapter XXIII. But they all yield in interest to this\r\npassage along the equatorial line, and especially in the line of\r\nhistory. Who has not heard of Gonzalo Pizarro and his fatal yet famous\r\nexpedition into \"the land of cinnamon?\" How he was led farther and\r\nfarther into the wilderness by the glittering illusions of an El\r\nDorado,[111] till the faithless Orellana, deserting him, floated down\r\nthe Napo and made the magnificent discovery of the mighty Amazon.\r\nGonzalo, \"who was held to be the best lancer that ever went to these\r\ncountries--and all confess that he never showed his back to the\r\nenemy\"--returned to Quito with a few survivors to tell a tale of almost\r\nunparalleled suffering. A century elapsed (1530-1637) before any one\r\nascended from Pará to Quito by way of the Rio Napo; this was\r\naccomplished by Pedro Teixeira.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Napo Peon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: The king of this fabulous land was said to wear a\r\nmagnificent attire fragrant with a costly gum, and sprinkled with gold\r\ndust. His palace was of porphyry and alabaster, and his throne of\r\nivory.]\r\n\r\nAn Indian will carry three arrobas (seventy-five pounds) besides his own\r\nprovisions, his provisions for the journey consisting of about\r\ntwenty-five pounds of roasted corn and barley-meal. The trunk or bundle\r\nis bound to his back by withes, which pass across the forehead and\r\nchest; a poncho or a handful of leaves protects the bare back from\r\nchafing. All our luggage (amounting to nearly fifteen hundred pounds)\r\nwas divided and packed to suit this method of transportation, so that we\r\nrequired twenty Indians. So many, however, of the right kind--for they\r\nmust be athletic young men to endure the fatigues of such a\r\njourney--could not be furnished by the little village of Papallacta, so\r\nwe were obliged to wait a few days till more Indians could be summoned\r\nfrom a neighboring town. When these arrived, the little world of\r\nPapallacta, men, women, and children, assembled in front of the\r\ngovernor's house, while Don Carlos sat by our side on a raised seat by\r\nthe doorway. A long parley ensued, resulting in this: that we should pay\r\none hundred Ecuadorian dollars for the transfer of our baggage to\r\nArchidona; while Carlos solemnly promised for the young men that they\r\nshould start the next morning, that they should arrive at Archidona\r\nwithin a stipulated time, and that they should not depend upon us for an\r\nounce of food. The powerful influence of the curate, which we had\r\nsecured, and the proclamation from the president, which Carlos read\r\naloud in the ears of all the people, together with the authoritative\r\ncharge of Carlos himself, had the desired effect; not a transportation\r\ncompany in the United States ever kept its engagement more faithfully\r\nthan did these twenty peons--and this, too, though we paid them in\r\nadvance, according to the custom of the country. Upon a blanket spread\r\nat our feet the money was counted out, and Carlos slowly distributed it\r\nwith a grave and reverend air, to every Indian five dollars.[112]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: We give below the autograph of this wisest man in all the\r\nOriente: \"Recibio del Señor James Orton la suma de centos (100) pesos\r\npor vente (20) peones hasta Archidona.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: reproduction of a signature is here]\r\n\r\n\"Papallacta, 4 Nov., 1867.\"]\r\n\r\nTuesday morning, November 5th, the peons promptly shouldered their\r\nburdens, and we, shod with _alpargates_, and with Alpine staff in hand\r\n(more needed here than in Switzerland), followed after, leaving the\r\ngovernor to sleep inside his mansion, and to eat his lice unmolested. On\r\na little grassy knoll just outside the town our train halted for a\r\nmoment--the Indians to take their fill of chicha, and bid their friends\r\ngood-by, and we to call the roll and take an inventory. Our leader was\r\nIsiro, a bright, intelligent, finely-featured, stalwart Indian. He could\r\nspeak Spanish, and his comrades acknowledged his superiority with marked\r\ndeference. Ten women and children followed us for two days, to relieve\r\nthe men of their burdens. Their assistance was not needed in the latter\r\npart of the journey, for our keen appetites rapidly lightened the\r\nprovision cans. Starting again, we plunged at once into the forest,\r\ntaking a northeasterly course along the left bank of a tributary to the\r\nCoca. The ups and downs of this day's travel of twelve miles were\r\nforeshadowings of what might come in our \"views afoot\" in South America.\r\nWe encamped at a spot the Indians called Maspa. Herndon says: \"The\r\n(Peruvian) Indians take no account of time or distance; they stop when\r\nthey get tired, and arrive when God pleases.\"[113] But our Napo\r\ncompanions measured distance by hours quite accurately, and they always\r\ntraveled as far as we were willing to follow. In ten minutes they built\r\nus a booth for the night; driving two crotchets into the ground, they\r\njoined them with a ridge-pole, against which they inclined a number of\r\nsticks for rafters. These they covered with palm-leaves, so adroitly put\r\ntogether that our roof was generally rain-proof. After ablution and an\r\nentire change of garments, we built a fire, using for fuel a green tree\r\ncalled _sindicaspi_ (meaning the wood that burns), a special provision\r\nin these damp forests where every thing is dripping with moisture. The\r\nfall of a full-grown tree under the strokes of a Yankee axe was a marvel\r\nin the eyes of our Indians. Our second day's journey was far more\r\ndifficult than the first, the path winding up steep mountains and down\r\ninto grand ravines, for we were crossing the outlying spurs of the\r\nEastern Cordillera. Every where the track was slippery with mud, and\r\noften we sank two feet into the mire. How devoutly we did wish that the\r\nEcuadorian Congress was compelled to travel this horrid road once a\r\nyear! At 10 o'clock we reached a lone habitation called Guila, where\r\nwooden bowls are made for the Quito market. Here we procured a fresh\r\nIndian to take the place of one of our peons who had given out under his\r\nburden. We advanced this day sixteen miles in ten hours, sleeping under\r\nan old bamboo hut beside a babbling brook bearing the euphonious name of\r\nPachamama.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: \"Distance is frequently estimated by the time that a man\r\nwill occupy in taking a chew of coca,\" or 37-1/2 minutes.--_Herndon_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n     Baeza.--The Forest.--Crossing the\r\n     Cosanga.--Curi-urcu.--Archidona.--Appearance, Customs, and Belief\r\n     of the Natives.--Napo and Napo River.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight hours' hard travel from Pachamama brought us to Baeza. This\r\n\"Antigua Ciudad,\" as Villavicencio calls it, was founded in 1552 by Don\r\nEgilio Ramirez Dávalos, and named after the quite different spot where\r\nScipio the Younger routed Asdrubal a thousand years before. It consists\r\nof two habitations, the residence of two families of Tumbaco Indians,\r\nsituated in a clearing of the forest on the summit of a high ridge\r\nrunning along the right bank of the Coca. This point, about one hundred\r\nmiles east of Quito, is important in the little traffic of the Oriente.\r\nAll Indian trains from the capital to the province pass through Baeza,\r\nwhere the trail divides; one branch passing on easterly to San José, and\r\nthence down through Abila and Loreto to Santa Rosa; the other leading to\r\nthe Napo through Archidona. Here we rested one day, taking possession of\r\none half of the larger hut--a mere stockade with a palm-leaf roof,\r\nwithout chairs, chimney, or fire-place, except any place on the floor.\r\nWe swung our hammocks, while our Indians stretched themselves on the\r\nground beneath us. The island of Juan Fernandez is not a more isolated\r\nspot than Baeza. A dense forest, impenetrable save by the trails,\r\nstretches away on every side to the Andes and to the Atlantic, and\r\nnortherly and southerly along the slope of the entire mountain chain.\r\nThe forest is such an entangled mass of the living and the fallen, it is\r\ndifficult to say which is the predominant spirit--life or death. It is\r\nthe cemetery, as well as the birthplace, of a world of vegetation. The\r\ntrees are more lofty than on the Lower Amazon, and straight as an\r\narrow, but we saw none of remarkable size. A perpetual mist seems to\r\nhang on the branches, and the dense foliage forms dark, lofty vaults,\r\nwhich the sunlight never enters. The soil and air are always cool, and\r\nnever dry. Every thing is penetrated with dampness. All our watches\r\nstopped, and remained immovable till we reached Pará. It is this\r\nconstant and excessive humidity which renders it so difficult to\r\ntransport provisions or prepare an herbarium. The pending branches of\r\nmoss are so saturated with moisture that sometimes the branches are\r\nbroken off to the peril of the passing traveler. Yet the climate is\r\nhealthy. The stillness and gloom are almost painful; the firing of a gun\r\nwakes a dull echo, and any unlooked-for noise is startling. Scarce a\r\nbird or a flower is to be seen in these sombre shades. Nearly the only\r\nsigns of animal life visible thus far were insects, mostly butterflies,\r\nfire-flies, and beetles. The only quadruped seen on our journey to the\r\nNapo was a long-tailed marten caught by the Indians. The silence is\r\nalmost perfect; its chief interruption is the crashing fall of some old\r\npatriarch of the forest, overcome by the embrace of loving parasites\r\nthat twine themselves about the trunk or sit upon the branches. The most\r\nstriking singularity in these tropical woods is the host of lianas or\r\nair-roots of epiphytous plants, which hang down from the lofty boughs,\r\nstraight as plumb-lines, some singly, others in clusters; some reaching\r\nhalf way to the ground, others touching it and striking their rootlets\r\ninto the earth. We found lianas over one hundred feet long. Sometimes a\r\ntoppling tree is caught in the graceful arms of looping _sipôs_, and\r\nheld for years by this natural cable. It is these dead trunks, standing\r\nlike skeletons, which give a character of solemnity to these primeval\r\nwoods. The wildest disorder is seen along the mountain torrents, where\r\nthe trees, prostrated by the undermining current, lie mingled with huge\r\nstones brought down by the force of the water. In many places the crowns\r\nof stately monarchs standing on the bank interlock and form a sylvan\r\narch over the river.\r\n\r\nWe left Baeza by the southerly trail for Archidona. From Papallacta we\r\nhad traveled east, or parallel to the streams which flow down from the\r\nmountains. We were now to cross them (and their name is legion), as also\r\nthe intervening ridges; so that our previous journey was nothing to that\r\nwhich followed. Sometimes we were climbing up an almost vertical ascent,\r\nthen descending into a deep, dark ravine, to ford a furious river; while\r\non the lowlands the path seemed lost in a jungle of bamboos, till our\r\nIndian \"bushwhackers\" opened a passage with their machetas, and we crept\r\nunder a low arcade of foliage. This day we enjoyed something unusual in\r\nour forest trail--a distant view. The path brought us to the verge of a\r\nmountain, whence we could look down on the savage valley of the Cosanga\r\nand upward to the dazzling dome of Antisana; it was our farewell view of\r\nthat glorious volcano. At the distance of twelve miles from Baeza we\r\nreached the banks of the Rio Cosanga, camping at a spot called\r\nChiniplaya. This is the river so much dreaded by Indians and whites\r\ntraversing the Napo wilderness. It is fearfully rapid--a very Tigris\r\nfrom its source to its junction with the Coca. The large, smooth\r\nboulders strewn along its bed show its power. Here, sixty miles from its\r\norigin in the glaciers of Antisana, it is seventy-five feet wide, but in\r\nthe wet season it is one hundred yards. The day following we threaded\r\nour difficult way, a _via dolorosa_, fifteen miles up the left bank of\r\nthe Cosanga, where we crossed and camped on the opposite side. The\r\nIndians had thrown a log over the deepest part of the river, and the\r\nrest we forded without much danger; but that very night the rain raised\r\nthe river to such a magnitude that the little bridge was carried off.\r\nHad we been one day later, we might have waited a week on the other side\r\nof the impassable gulf. Between this point where we forded and\r\nChiniplaya, fifteen miles below, the barometer indicated a fall of five\r\nhundred feet. The roar of the rushing waters is like that of the sea. In\r\nthe beautiful language of Darwin (_Journal_, p. 316): \"The sound spoke\r\neloquently to the geologist; the thousands and thousands of stones,\r\nwhich, striking against each other, made the one dull, uniform sound,\r\nwere all hurrying in one direction. It was like thinking on time, when\r\nthe minute that now glides past is irrecoverable. So was it with these\r\nstones. The ocean is their eternity, and each note of that wild music\r\ntold of one more step toward their destiny.\"\r\n\r\nOn account of the heavy rain and the sickness of a peon, whom finally we\r\nwere obliged to leave behind, we rested one day; but on the morrow we\r\ntraveled fourteen miles, crossing the lofty Guacamayo ridge,[114]\r\nfording at much risk the deep Cochachimbamba, and camping at a spot (the\r\nIndians have a name for almost any locality in the forest) called\r\nGuayusapugaru. The next day we must have advanced twenty miles, besides\r\ncrossing the furious Hondachi. This river was very much swollen by the\r\nrains, and it was only by the aid of a rope that we made the passage.\r\nOne stout Indian was carried down stream, but soon recovered himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Humboldt speaks of this as an active volcano, \"from which\r\ndetonations are heard almost daily.\" We heard nothing. It is possible\r\nthat he meant Guamani.]\r\n\r\nAs we had lowered our altitude since leaving Papallacta seven thousand\r\nfeet, the climate was much warmer, and vegetation more prolific. Nowhere\r\nelse between the Andes and the Atlantic did we notice such a majestic\r\nforest. The tree-ferns, ennobled by the tropical sun and soil, have a\r\npalm-like appearance, but with rougher stems and a usual height of fifty\r\nfeet. Plants akin to our \"scouring rush\" rise twenty-five feet. We saw\r\nto-day the \"water tree,\" or _huadhuas_ of the natives, a kind of bamboo,\r\nwhich sometimes yields between the joints two quarts of clear,\r\ntaste-less water. Late in the evening we reached an old rancho called\r\n_Curi-urcu_ (\"the mountain of gold\"); but we had traveled so far ahead\r\nof our cargo-train we did not see it again till the next morning. We\r\nwere obliged, therefore, to sleep on the ground in our wet clothes, and\r\nput up with hard commons--half parched corn, which our Indian guides\r\ngave us, and unleavened cakes or flour-paste baked on the coals. Thence,\r\nafter a short day's journey of ten miles, we arrived at Archidona, by a\r\npath, however, that was slippery with a soft yellow clay. We were a\r\nsorry-looking company, soaked by incessant rains, exhausted by\r\nperspiration, plastered with mud, tattered, and torn; but we were kindly\r\nmet by the Jesuit bishop, who took us to his own habitation, where one\r\nIndian washed our feet, and another prepared a most refreshing drink of\r\n_guayusa_ tea. We then took up our quarters at the Government House,\r\nopposite the bishop's, sojourning several days on account of our swollen\r\nfeet, and also on account of a swollen river which ran between us and\r\nthe Napo. Here we made a valuable collection of birds, lizards, fishes,\r\nand butterflies.\r\n\r\nArchidona is situated in a beautiful plain on the high northern bank of\r\nthe Misagualli, two thousand feet above the Atlantic. The site is a\r\ncleared spot in the heart of an almost boundless forest; and it was a\r\nrelief, not easily conceived, to emerge from beneath the dense leafy\r\ncanopy into this open space and look up to the sky and to the snowy\r\nAndes. The climate is uniform and delightful, the mean annual\r\ntemperature being seventy-seven degrees. Sand-flies, however, resembling\r\nour \"punkies,\" abound; and the natives are constantly slapping their\r\nnaked sides, eating the little pests as the Papallactans do their\r\nlice.[115] Archidona is the largest village in the Napo country,\r\ncontaining about five hundred souls. The houses are of split bamboo and\r\npalm-thatch, often hid in a plantation of yuca and plantain. The central\r\nand most important structure is the little church; its rude belfry,\r\nportico, chancel, images, and other attempts at ornament remind us of\r\nthe fitting words of Mrs. Agassiz, that \"there is something touching in\r\nthe idea that these poor, uneducated people of the forest have cared to\r\nbuild themselves a temple with their own hands, lavishing upon it such\r\nideas of beauty and taste as they have, and bringing at least their best\r\nto their humble altar.\" Founded by Dávalos in 1560, Archidona has been a\r\nmissionary station for two hundred years. The people are child-like and\r\ndocile, but the bishop confessed there was no intellectual advance.\r\nEvery morning and evening, at the tinkling of a little bell, all\r\nArchidona assembled in the open porch, where the bishop taught them to\r\nsing and pray. It was a novel sight to see these children of the forest\r\ncoming out of the woods on all sides and running up to the temple--for\r\nthese natives, whenever they move, almost invariably go on a run. The\r\nmen are tall and slim and of a dark red color, and their legs are bent\r\nbackward at the knees. The governor was the only portly individual we\r\nsaw. The women are short, with high shoulders, and are very timid; they\r\nseldom stand erect, and with the knees bent forward they run sneakingly\r\nto church. Their eyes have a characteristic, soft, drooping look. They\r\ncarry their babes generally on the hip; not on the back, as in Quito.\r\nThe men are hatless, shirtless, and shoeless; their only garments are\r\nshort drawers, about six inches long, and little ponchos, both of\r\nlienzo, dyed a dark purple with achote--the red seeds of the bixa, which\r\nthe cooks of Quito use to color their soups. All paint their bodies with\r\nthe same pigment. The women wear a frock reaching from the waist to the\r\nknees; it is nothing more than a yard or two of lienzo wound around the\r\nbody. The Archidonians are the most Christianized of all the Napo\r\nIndians, but they can not be called religious. Their rites (they can\r\nhardly be said to have a creed) are the _a_, _b_, _c_, of Romanism,\r\nmingled with some strange notions--the relics of a lost paganism. They\r\nare very superstitious, and believe, as before remarked, in the\r\ntransmigration of souls. Maniacs they think are possessed by an evil\r\ndemon, and therefore are treated with great cruelty. Negroes (of whom a\r\nfew specimens have come up the Napo from Brazil) are held to be under\r\nthe ban of the Almighty, and their color is ascribed to the singeing\r\nwhich they got in the flames of hell. They do not believe in disease;\r\nbut, like the Mundurucus on the Tapajos, say that death is always caused\r\nby the sorceries of an enemy. They usually bury in the church or in the\r\ntambo of the deceased. Celibacy and polygamy, homicide and suicide, are\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: The Chasuta Indians, Herndon says, eat musquitoes that\r\nthey catch on their bodies with the idea of restoring the blood which\r\nthe insect has abstracted.]\r\n\r\nThe only sign of industry in Archidona is the manufacture of pita thread\r\nfrom the aloe. It is exported to Quito on human backs. The inhabitants\r\nalso collect copal at the headwaters of the Hondachi, and use it for\r\nillumination. It can be bought in Archidona for three or four cents a\r\npound. The gum exudes from a lofty leguminous tree having an oak-like\r\nbark. It resembles the animé of Madagascar rather than the copal of\r\nIndia, which flows from an entirely different tree. Guayusa, or \"Napo\r\ntea,\" is another and celebrated production of Archidona. It is the large\r\nleaf of a tall shrub growing wild. An infusion of guayusa, like the\r\n_maté_ of Paraguay (which belongs to the same genus _Ilex_), is so\r\nrefreshing it supplies for a long time the place of food. The Indians\r\nwill go to Quito on this beverage alone, its virtues being similar to\r\nthose of _coca_, on the strength of which the posts of the Incas used to\r\ntravel incredible distances. It is by no means, however, such a\r\nstimulant. It is a singular fact, observes Dr. Jameson, that tea,\r\ncoffee, cacao, maté, and guayusa contain the same alkaloid caffeine. The\r\nlast, however, contains only one fifteenth as much of the active\r\nprinciple as tea, and no volatile oil. Herndon found guayusa on the\r\nUcayali.\r\n\r\nAt Archidona we took a new set of peons for Napo, as the Papallactans do\r\nnot travel farther. The distance is sixteen miles, and the path is\r\ncomparatively good, though it crosses two rivers, the Misagualli and\r\nTena. On this journey we found the only serpent seen since leaving\r\nQuito. This solitary specimen was sluggish and harmless, but exceedingly\r\nbeautiful. It was the _Amphisboena fuliginosa_, or \"slow-worm.\" It\r\nlives in the chambers of the Saüba ants. We met a procession of these\r\nants, each carrying a circular piece of a leaf vertically over its head.\r\nThese insects are peculiar to tropical America, and are much dreaded in\r\nBrazil, where they soon despoil valuable trees of their foliage. They\r\ncut the leaves with their scissor-like jaws, and use them to thatch the\r\ndomes at the entrance of their subterranean dwellings.\r\n\r\nAt Napo we took possession of the governor's house. Each village in the\r\nNapo province was obliged to build an edifice of split bamboo for that\r\ndignitary; and, as he no longer exists, they are left unoccupied. They\r\ngenerally stand on the highest and best site in the town, and are a\r\ngod-send to travelers. Immediately on our arrival, the Indian governor\r\nand his staff of justices called to see what we wanted, and during our\r\nstay supplied us with chickens, eggs, plantains, yucas, and fuel. His\r\nexcellency would always come, silver-headed cane in hand, though the\r\njustices had only six eggs or a single fowl to bring us. The alcalde\r\nalso paid us his respects. He is an old blanco (as the whites are\r\ncalled), doing a little traffic in gold dust, lienzo, and pita, but is\r\nthe highest representative of Ecuador in the Napo country. Here, too, we\r\nmet, to our great delight, Mr. George Edwards, a native of Connecticut,\r\nwho has settled himself, probably for life, in the depths of this\r\nwilderness. He was equally rejoiced to see the face and hear the speech\r\nof a countryman. His industry and upright character have won for him the\r\nrespect and good-will of the Indians, and he is favorably known in\r\nQuito. The government has given him a tract of land on the Yusupino, two\r\nmiles west of Napo village. Here he is cultivating vanilla, of which he\r\nhas now three thousand plants, and also his patience, for six years\r\nelapse after transplanting before a pod appears. He has been so long in\r\nthe country (thirteen years) his English would now and then run off into\r\nSpanish or Quichua.\r\n\r\nNapo is prettily situated on the left bank of the Rio Napo, a dense\r\nforest inclosing it on every side. The maximum number of inhabitants is\r\neighty families; but many of these are in town only in festival seasons.\r\nIt was well for us that we reached the Napo during the feasts; otherwise\r\nwe might not have found men enough to man our canoes down the river.\r\nThere are three or four blancos, petty merchants, who follow the old\r\nSpanish practice of compulsory sales, forcing the Indians to take\r\nlienzo, knives, beads, etc., at exorbitant prices, and making them pay\r\nin gold dust and pita. This kind of commerce is known under the name of\r\n_repartos_. It is hard to find an Indian whose gold or whose labor is\r\nnot claimed by the blancos. The present and possible productions of this\r\nregion are: bananas, plantains, yucas,[116] yams, sweet potatoes, rice,\r\nbeans, corn, lemons, oranges, chirimoyas, anonas (a similar fruit to the\r\npreceding), pine-apples, palm cabbages, guavas, guayavas, castor-oil\r\nbeans, coffee, cacao, cinnamon, India-rubber, vanilla (two kinds),[117]\r\nchonta-palm nuts, sarsaparilla, contrayerva (a mint), tobacco (of\r\nsuperior quality), and guayusa; of woods, balsam, red wood, Brazil wood,\r\npalo de cruz, palo de sangre, ramo caspi, quilla caspi, guayacan (or\r\n\"holy wood,\" being much used for images), ivory palm, a kind of ebony,\r\ncedar, and aguana (the last two used for making canoes); of dyewoods,\r\nsarne (dark red), tinta (blue), terriri, and quito (black); of gums,\r\nestoraque (a balsam) and copal, besides a black beeswax, the production\r\nof a small (Trigona) bee, that builds its comb in the ground; of\r\nmanufactures, pita, hammocks, twine, calabashes, aguardiente (from the\r\nplantain), chicha (from the yuca),[118] sugar and molasses (from the\r\ncane, which grows luxuriantly), and manati-lard; of minerals, gold dust.\r\nThe gold, in minute spangles, is washed down by the rivers at flood\r\ntime, chiefly from the Llanganati Mountains. The articles desired in\r\nexchange are lienzo, thread, needles, axes, hoes, knives, fish-hooks,\r\nrings, medals, crosses, beads, mirrors, salt, and poison. Quito nearly\r\nmonopolizes the trade; though a few canoes go down the Napo to the\r\nMarañon after salt and poison. The salt comes from near Chasuta, on the\r\nHuallaga;[119] the _urari_ from the Ticuna Indians. It takes about\r\ntwenty days to paddle down to the Marañon, and three months to pole up.\r\nThe Napo is navigable for a flat-bottomed steamer as far as Santa\r\nRosa,[120] and it is a wonder that Anglo-Saxon enterprise has not put\r\none upon these waters. The profits would be great, as soon as commercial\r\nrelations with the various tribes were established.[121] Four yards of\r\ncoarse cotton cloth, for example, will exchange for one hundred pounds\r\nof sarsaparilla. _Urari_ is sold at Napo for its weight in silver. By a\r\ndecree of the Ecuadorian Congress, there will be no duty on foreign\r\ngoods entering the Napo for twenty years. The Napo region, under proper\r\ncultivation, would yield the most valuable productions of either\r\nhemisphere in profusion. But agriculture is unknown; there is no word\r\nfor plow. The natives spend most of their time in idleness, or feasting\r\nand hunting. Their weapons are blow-guns and wooden spears; our guns\r\nthey call by a word which signifies \"thunder and lightning.\" Laying up\r\nfor the future or for commerce is foreign to their ideas. The houses are\r\nall built of bamboo tied together with lianas, and shingled with leaves\r\nof the sunipanga palm. The Indians are peaceful, good-natured, and idle.\r\nThey seldom steal any thing but food. Their only stimulants are chicha,\r\nguayusa, and tobacco. This last they roll up in plantain leaves and\r\nsmoke, or snuff an infusion of it through the nose from the upper bill\r\nof a toucan. \"The Peruvians (says Prescott, quoting Garcilasso) differ\r\nfrom every other Indian nation to whom tobacco was known by using it\r\nonly for medicinal purposes in the form of snuff.\" There is no bread on\r\nthe Napo; the nearest approach to flour is yuca starch. There are no\r\nclocks or watches; time is measured by the position of the sun. The mean\r\ntemperature at Napo village is about one degree warmer than that of\r\nArchidona. Its altitude above the sea is 1450 feet. The nights are cool,\r\nand there are no musquitoes; but sand-flies are innumerable. Jiggers\r\nalso have been seen. There are no well-defined wet and dry seasons; but\r\nthe most rain falls in May, June, and July. The lightning, Edwards\r\ninformed us, seldom strikes. Dysentery, fevers, and rheumatism are the\r\nprevailing diseases; and we saw one case of goître. But the climate is\r\nconsidered salubrious. Few twins are born; and there are fewer children\r\nthan in Archidona--a difference ascribed by some to the exposure of the\r\nNapo people in gold washing; by others to the greater quantity of\r\nguayusa drunk by the Archidonians.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Sometimes called _yuca dulce_, or sweet yuca, to\r\ndistinguish it from the _yuca brava_, or wild yuca, the mandioca of the\r\nAmazon, from which farina is made. The yuca is the beet-like root of a\r\nlittle tree about ten feet high. It is a good substitute for potatoes\r\nand bread.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Vanilla belongs to the orchid family, and is the only\r\nmember which possesses any economical value. It is a graceful climber\r\nand has a pretty star-like flower.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: In Peru, the liquor made from yuca is called _masato_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Rock-salt is found on both sides of the Andes. \"The\r\ngeneral character of the geology of these countries would rather lead to\r\nthe opinion that its origin is in some way connected with volcanic heat\r\nat the bottom of the sea.\"--Darwin's _Observations_, pt. iii., p. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: \"The Napo (Herndon was told) is very full of sand-banks,\r\nand twenty days from its mouth (or near the confluence of the Curaray)\r\nthe men have to get overboard and drag the canoes!\"--_Report_, p. 229.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: The chief difficulty throughout the Upper Amazon is in\r\ngetting the Indians to concentrate along the bank. But honorable dealing\r\nwould accomplish this in time.]\r\n\r\nThe Napo is the largest river in the republic. From its source in the\r\noriental defiles of Cotopaxi and Sincholagua to its embouchure at the\r\nMarañon, its length is not far from eight hundred miles, or about twice\r\nthat of the Susquehanna.[122] From Napo village to the mouth of the\r\nriver our barometer showed a fall of a thousand feet. At Napo the\r\ncurrent is six miles an hour; between Napo and Santa Rosa there are\r\nrapids; and between Santa Rosa and the Marañon the rate is not less than\r\nfour miles an hour. At Napo the breadth is about forty yards; at Coca\r\nthe main channel is fifteen hundred feet wide; and at Camindo it is a\r\nfull Spanish mile. Below Coca the river throws out numerous canals,\r\nwhich, isolating portions of the forest-clad lowlands, create numerous\r\npicturesque islands. Around and between them the river winds, usually\r\nmaking one bend in every league. The tall trees covering them are bound\r\ntogether by creeping plants into a thick jungle, the home of capybaras\r\nand the lair of the jaguar. The islands, entirely alluvial, are\r\nperiodically flooded, and undergo a constant round of decay and\r\nrenovation. Indeed, the whole river annually changes its channel, so\r\nthat navigation is somewhat difficult. The Indians, on coming to a fork,\r\nwere frequently at a loss to know which was the main channel. Then, too,\r\nthe river is full of snags and _plaias_, or low, shelving sand-banks,\r\nrising just above the water-level--the resort of turtles during the egg\r\nseason. It was interesting to trace the bed of the river as we floated\r\ndown; on the rapid slope of the Cordilleras rushing over or rolling\r\nalong huge boulders, which farther on were rapidly reduced in size,\r\ntill, in time, boulders were broken into pebbles, pebbles turned into\r\nsand, and sand reduced to impalpable mud.[123] The _plaias_ are not\r\nauriferous. Below Coca there is a wilderness of lagunes, all connected\r\nwith the river, the undisturbed retreat of innumerable water-fowl. The\r\nonly spot on the Napo where the underlying rocks are exposed is near\r\nNapo village. There it is a dark slate, gently dipping east. Farther\r\nwest, in fact, throughout this side of the Andes, the prevailing rock is\r\nmica-schist. But the entire Napo country is covered with an alluvial\r\nbed, on the average ten feet thick.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Its actual source is the Rio del Valle, which runs\r\nnorthward through the Valle Vicioso. Its longest tributary, the Curaray,\r\nrises only a few miles to the south in the Cordillera de los Mulatos.\r\nThe two rivers run side by side 4° of longitude before meeting. Coca,\r\nthe northern branch, originates in the flanks of Cayambi. The Napo and\r\nits branches are represented incorrectly in every map we have examined.\r\nThe Aguarico is confounded with the Santa Maria and made too long, and\r\nthe Curaray is represented too far above the mouth of the Napo. There\r\nare no settlements between Coca and Camindo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: From specimens of sand which we obtained at different\r\npoints in descending the river, we find that at Coca it contains 17.5\r\nper cent. of pure quartz grains, the rest being colored dark with\r\naugite: at the mouth of the Napo there is 50 per cent. of pure quartz,\r\nthe other half being light-colored and feldspathic.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n     Afloat on the Napo.--Down the Rapids.--Santa Rosa and its mulish\r\n     Alcalde.--Pratt on Discipline.--Forest Music.--Coca.--Our Craft and\r\n     Crew.--Storm on the Napo.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe embarked November 20th on our voyage down the river. It is no easy\r\nmatter to hire or cajole the Indians for any service. Out of feast-time\r\nthey are out of town, and during the festival they are loth to leave, or\r\nare so full of chicha they do not know what they want. We first woke up\r\nthe indolent alcalde by showing him the President's order, and then used\r\nhim to entice or to compel (we know not his motive power) eight Indians,\r\nincluding the governor, to take us to Santa Rosa. We paid them about\r\ntwenty-four yards of lienzo, the usual currency here. They furnished\r\nthree canoes, two for baggage and one covered with a palm-leaf awning\r\nfor ourselves. The canoes were of red cedar, and flat-bottomed; the\r\npaddles had oval blades, to which short, quick strokes were given\r\nperpendicularly to the water entering and leaving. But there was little\r\nneed of paddling on this trip.\r\n\r\nThe Napo starts off in furious haste, for the fall between Napo village\r\nand Santa Rosa, a distance of eighty miles, is three hundred and fifty\r\nfeet. We were about seven hours in the voyage down, and it takes seven\r\ndays to pole back. The passage of the rapids is dangerous to all but an\r\nIndian. As Wallace says of a spot on the Rio Negro, you are bewildered\r\nby the conflicting motions of the water. Whirling and boiling eddies\r\nburst as if from some subaqueous explosion; down currents are on one\r\nside of the canoe, and an up current on the other; now a cross stream\r\nat the bows and a diagonal one at the stern, with a foaming Scylla on\r\nyour right and a whirling Charybdis on the left. But our nervousness\r\ngave way to admiration as our popero, or pilot, the sedate governor,\r\ngave the canoe a sheer with the swoop of his long paddle, turning it\r\ngracefully around the corner of a rock against which it seemed we must\r\nbe dashed, and we felt like joining in the wild scream of the Indians as\r\nour little craft shot like an arrow past the danger and down the rapids,\r\nand danced on the waters below.\r\n\r\nIn four hours we were abreast the little village of Aguano; on the\r\nopposite bank we could see the tambos of the gold washers. At 5 P.M. we\r\nreached the deserted site of Old Santa Rosa, the village having been\r\nremoved a few years ago on account of its unhealthy location. It is now\r\novergrown with sour orange and calabash trees, the latter bearing large\r\nfruit shells so useful to the Indians in making pilches or cups. In\r\npitch darkness and in a drizzling rain we arrived at New Santa Rosa, and\r\nswung our hammocks in the Government House.\r\n\r\nSanta Rosa, once the prosperous capital of the Provincia del Oriente,\r\nnow contains about two hundred men, women, and children. The town is\r\npleasantly situated on the left bank of the river, about fifteen feet\r\nabove the water level. A little bamboo church, open only when the\r\nmissionary from Archidona makes his annual visit, stood near our\r\nquarters. The Indians were keeping one of their seven feasts in a hut\r\nnear by, and their drumming was the last thing we heard as we turned\r\ninto our hammocks, and the first in the morning. The alcalde, Pablo\r\nSandoval, is the only white inhabitant, and he is an Indian in every\r\nrespect save speech and color. His habitation is one of the largest\r\nstructures on the Napo; the posts are of chonta-palm, the sides and roof\r\nof the usual material--split bamboo and palm leaves. It is embowered in\r\na magnificent grove of plantains and papayas. In the spacious vestibule\r\nis a bench, on which the Indian governor and his staff seat themselves\r\nevery morning to confer with the alcalde. In one corner stands a table\r\n(the only one we remember seeing on the Napo); on the opposite side are\r\nheaped up jars, pots, kettles, hunting and fishing implements, paddles,\r\nbows and arrows. Between the posts swing two chambiri hammocks. From\r\nSanta Rosa to Pará the hammock answers for chair, sofa, _tête-à-tête_,\r\nand bed. When a stranger enters, he is invited to sit in a hammock; and\r\nat Santa Rosa we were always presented with a cup of guayusa; in Brazil\r\nwith a cup of coffee. Sandoval wore nothing but shirt and pantaloons;\r\nthe dignity of the barefooted functionary was confined to his Spanish\r\nblood. He had lived long among the Zaparos; and from him, his daughter,\r\nand a Zaparo servant, we obtained much valuable information respecting\r\nthat wild and little-known tribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Papaya-tree.]\r\n\r\nAt Santa Rosa we procured Indians and canoes for the Marañon. This was\r\nnot easily done. The Indians seemed reluctant to quit their feasts and\r\ngo on such a long voyage, and the alcalde was unwilling they should go,\r\nand manufactured a host of lies and excuses. He declared there was but\r\none large canoe in town, and that we must send to Suno for another, and\r\nfor men to man it. There were indeed few Indians in Santa Rosa, for\r\nwhile we were disputing a largo number went off with shoutings down the\r\nriver, to spend weeks in the forest hunting monkeys.[124] It was a\r\nstirring sight to see these untamed red men in the depths of the Napo\r\nwilderness starting on a monkey crusade; but it was still more stirring\r\nto think of paddling our own canoe down to Brazil. After some time lost\r\nin word-fighting, we tried the virtues of authority. We presented the\r\npresident's order, which commanded all civil and military powers on the\r\nNapo to aid, and not to hinder, the expedition; then we put into his\r\nhand an official letter from the alcalde of Napo (to whom Pablo was\r\nsubordinate), which, with a flourish of dignified Spanish, threatened\r\nSanta Rosa with the doom of Sodom and Gomorrah if any impediment was\r\nplaced in our way.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Monkeys form an article of food throughout tropical\r\nAmerica. The meat is tough, but keeps longer than any other in that\r\nclimate. The Indians told Gibbon that \"the tail is the most delicate\r\npart when the hair is properly singed.\"]\r\n\r\nTo all this Edwards, who had kindly accompanied us down the river thus\r\nfar, added, with frightful gestures, that he purposed to report him to\r\nthe Quito government. After this bombardment Sandoval was another man,\r\nand the two canoes and four Indians we wanted were forthcoming. We had\r\nto wait, however, two days for the Indians to prepare their chicha for\r\nthe journey and to cover the canoes with palm awnings. The price of a\r\ncanoe for the Marañon is twenty-five varas of lienzo, and the same for\r\neach Indian. Unfortunately we had only fifty varas left; but, through\r\nthe influence of the now good-natured alcalde, we induced the Indians to\r\ntake the balance in coin. After many delays, we put our baggage into\r\none canoe, and ourselves into the other, and pushed off into the rapid\r\ncurrent of the Napo. We had three styles of valediction on leaving. Our\r\nIndian quartet, after several last drinks of chicha, bade their friends\r\nfarewell by clasping hands, one kissing the joined hands, and then the\r\nother. Sandoval muttered _adios_ in reply to ours, meaning, no doubt,\r\ngood riddance, while we shouted a hearty good-bye to Edwards as he\r\npushed his way up stream to continue his lonely but chosen Indian life\r\non the banks of the Yusupino.\r\n\r\nThe Napo at Santa Rosa runs at least five miles an hour, and we were\r\nsoon picking our way--now drifting, now paddling--through a labyrinth of\r\nislands and snags. The Indians, so accustomed to brutal violence from\r\nthe hands of the whites, had begged of us, before our departure, that we\r\nwould not beat them. But shortly after we left, one of them, who was\r\nliterally filled with chicha, dropped his paddle and tumbled into a heap\r\nat the bottom of the canoe, dead drunk. Pratt, our gigantic Mississippi\r\nboatman, whom we had engaged at Quito as captain and cook down the\r\nriver, and who was an awful Goliath in the eyes of the red-skins, seized\r\nthe fellow and gave him a terrible shaking, the like of which was never\r\nseen or heard of in all Napo. At once the liquor left the muddled brain\r\nof the astonished culprit, and, taking his paddle, he became from that\r\nhour the best of the crew. This was the only case of discipline on the\r\nvoyage. Always obsequious, they obeyed us with fear and trembling. None\r\nof them could speak Spanish, so we had provided ourselves with a\r\nvocabulary of Quichua. But some English words, like the imperative\r\n_paddle_! were more effective than the tongue of the Incas. Indeed, when\r\nwe mixed up our Quichua with a little Anglo-Saxon, they evidently\r\nthought the latter was a terrible anathema, for they sprang to their\r\nplaces without delay.\r\n\r\nIn seven hours we arrived at Suno, a collection of half a dozen palm\r\nbooths, five feet high, the miserable owners of which do a little\r\nfishing and gold-washing. They gave us possession of their largest hut,\r\nin which they had been roasting a sea-cow, and the stench was\r\nintolerable. Nevertheless, one of our number bravely threw down his\r\nblanket within, and went to sleep; two swung their hammocks between the\r\ntrees, and the rest slept in the canoe. Here, for the first time since\r\nleaving Guayaquil, we were tormented by musquitoes. Bats were also quite\r\nnumerous, but none of them were blood-thirsty; and we may add that\r\nnowhere in South America were we troubled by those diabolical imps of\r\nimaginative travelers, the leaf-nosed species. So far as our experience\r\ngoes, we can say, with Bates, that the vampire, so common on the Amazon,\r\nis the most harmless of all bats. It has, however, a most hideous\r\nphysiognomy. A full-grown specimen will measure twenty-eight inches in\r\nexpanse of wing. Bates found two species on the Amazon--one black, the\r\nother of a ruddy line, and both fruit-eaters.\r\n\r\nThe nocturnal music of these forests is made by crickets and tree-toads.\r\nThe voice of the latter sounds like the cracking of wood. Occasionally\r\nfrogs, owls, and goat-suckers croak, hoot, and wail. Between midnight\r\nand 3 A.M. almost perfect silence reigns. At early dawn the animal\r\ncreation awakes with a scream. Pre-eminent are the discordant cries of\r\nmonkeys and macaws. As the sun rises higher, one musician after another\r\nseeks the forest shade, and the morning concert ends at noon. In the\r\nheat of the day there is an all-pervading rustling sound, caused by the\r\nfluttering of myriad insects and the gliding of lizards and snakes. At\r\nsunset parrots and monkeys resume their chatter for a season, and then\r\ngive way to the noiseless flight of innumerable bats chasing the\r\nhawk-moth and beetle. There is scarcely a sound in a tropical forest\r\nwhich is joyous and cheering. The birds are usually silent; those that\r\nhave voices utter a plaintive song, or hoarse, shrill cry. Our\r\ndoor-yards are far more melodious on a May morning. The most common\r\nbirds on the Napo are macaws, parrots, toucans, and ciganas. The\r\nparrots, like the majority in South America, are of the green type. The\r\ntoucan, peculiar to the New World, and distinguished by its enormous\r\nbill, is a quarrelsome, imperious bird. It is clumsy in flight, but\r\nnimble in leaping from limb to limb. It hops on the ground like a robin,\r\nand makes a shrill yelping--_pia-po-o-co_. Ecuadorians call it the\r\n_predicador_, or preacher, because it wags its head like a priest, and\r\nseems to say, \"God gave it you.\" The feathers of the breast are of most\r\nbrilliant yellow, orange, and rose colors, and the robes of the royal\r\ndames of Europe in the sixteenth century were trimmed with them. The\r\ncigana or \"gypsy\" (in Peru called \"chansu\") resembles a pheasant. The\r\nflesh has a musky odor, and it is for this reason, perhaps, that they\r\nexist in such numbers throughout the country. The Indians never eat\r\nthem. In no country as in the Amazonian Valley is there such a variety\r\nof insects; nowhere do we find species of larger size or greater beauty.\r\nIt is the richest locality for butterflies; Bates found twelve hundred\r\nspecies in Brazil alone, or three times as many as in all Europe. The\r\nsplendid metallic-blue, and the yellow and transparent-winged, are very\r\nabundant on the Napo; some rise high in the air; others, living in\r\nsocieties, look like fluttering clouds. Moths are comparatively rare.\r\nThe most conspicuous beetle on the river is a magnificent green species\r\n(_Chrysophora chrysochlora_), always found arboreal, like the majority\r\nof tropical coleopters; they look like emerald gems clinging to the\r\nbranches. There are two kinds of bees, the black and yellow, which the\r\nNapos name respectively _cushillo mishke_ (monkey honey) and _sara\r\nmishke_ (corn honey). It is singular these Indians have no term for\r\nbees, but call them honey, and distinguish them by their color. The\r\nblack species is said to make the most honey, and the yellow the best.\r\nThe quadrupeds of the Oriente are few and far between in the dry season.\r\nNot a sloth nor armadillo did we see. But when the rains descend the\r\nwilderness is a menagerie of tigers and tapirs, pumas and bears, while a\r\nhost of reptiles, led by the gigantic boa, creep forth from their\r\nhiding-places. The most ferocious carnivores are found in the mountains,\r\nand the most venomous serpents haunt the lowlands. Darwin says that we\r\nought not to expect any closer similarity between the organic beings on\r\nthe opposite sides of the Andes than on the opposite shores of the\r\nocean. We will remark that we obtained a peccari, a number of birds not\r\naccustomed to high flights, and five reptilian species, on the Pacific\r\nslope, identical with species found on the Napo.\r\n\r\nBreakfasting on fried yucas, roasted plantains, fish, and guayusa, we\r\nset sail, arriving at Coca at 2 P.M. This little village, the last we\r\nshall see till we come within sight of the Amazon, is beautifully\r\nlocated on the right bank, twenty-five feet above the river, and\r\nopposite the confluence of the Rio Coca. Though founded twenty years\r\nago, it contains only five or six bamboo huts, a government-house,\r\nchurch, alcalde's residence, and a _trapiche_ for the manufacture of\r\naguardiente and sirup from the cane.[125] The alcalde was a worthless\r\nblanco, who spent most of his time swinging in a hammock slung between\r\nthe posts of his veranda, and playing with a tame parrot when not drunk\r\nor asleep. This spot is memorable in history. Pizarro having reached it\r\nfrom Quito by way of Baeza and the Coca, halted and built a raft or\r\ncanoe (Prescott says a brig), in which Orellana was sent down the river\r\nto reconnoitre, but who never returned. Up to this point the Napo has an\r\neasterly course; but after receiving the Coca, it turns to the\r\nsoutheast. We remained here two days to construct a more comfortable\r\ncraft for our voyage to the Amazon, a distance of at least five hundred\r\nmiles. The canoe is the only means of navigation known to the Indians.\r\nBut the idea of spending fifteen days cooped, cribbed, and cramped in a\r\nnarrow canoe, exposed to a tropical sun and furious rains, was\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trapiche.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: The _trapiche_ or sugar-mill of the Andes is a rude\r\naffair. The cane is pressed between cogged wooden cylinders worked by\r\nbullocks, and the juice is received in troughs made of hollowed logs.]\r\n\r\nOur Santa Rosa canoes were about thirty feet long. These were placed\r\nabout five feet apart and parallel, and then firmly secured by bamboo\r\njoists. Over these we spread a flooring of split bamboo, and planted\r\nfour stout chonta sticks to support a palm-thatched roof. A rudder (a\r\nnovel idea to our red-skinned companions), and a box of sand in the\r\nstern of one of the boats for a fire-place, completed our rig. The\r\nalcalde, with a hiccough, declared we would be forever going down the\r\nriver in such a huge craft, and the Indians smiled ominously. But when\r\nour gallant ship left Coca obediently to the helm, and at the rate of\r\nsix miles an hour when paddles and current worked together, they shouted\r\n\"_bueno_!\" Our trunks and provision-cans were arranged along the two\r\nsides of the platform, so that we had abundance of from for exercise by\r\nday and for sleeping under musquito-tents at night. A little canoe,\r\nwhich we bought of the alcalde, floated alongside for a tender, and was\r\nvery serviceable in hunting, gathering fuel, etc. In the\r\n\"forecastle\"--the bows of the large canoes which projected beyond our\r\ncabin--sat three Indians to paddle. The fourth, who was the governor of\r\nSanta Rosa, we honored with the post of steersman; and he was always to\r\nbe seen on the poop behind the kitchen, standing bolt upright, on the\r\nalert and on the lookout. On approaching any human habitation, the\r\nIndians blew horns to indicate that they came as friends. These horns\r\nmust have come from Brazil, as there are no bovines on the Napo.\r\nWhenever they enter an unknown lagune they blow their horns also to\r\ncharm the _yacu-mama_, or mother-of-waters, as they call the imaginary\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\nAt different points down the river they deposited pots of chicha for\r\nuse on their return. The mass breeds worms so rapidly, however, as\r\nEdwards informed us, that after the lapse of a month or two it is a\r\njumble of yuca scraps and writhing articulates. But the owner of the\r\nheap coolly separates the animal from the vegetable, adds a little\r\nwater, and drinks his chicha without ceremony. During leisure hours the\r\nIndians busied themselves plaiting palm leaves into ornaments for their\r\narms and heads. Not a note did they whistle or sing. Yet they were\r\nalways in good humor, and during the whole voyage we did not see the\r\nslightest approach to a quarrel. At no time did we have the least fear\r\nof treachery or violence.\r\n\r\nThe Napos are not savages. Their goodness, however, as Bates says of the\r\nCucáma tribe, consists more in the absence of active bad qualities than\r\nin the possession of good ones. Of an apathetic temperament and dull\r\nimagination, we could not stir them into admiration or enthusiasm by any\r\nscientific wonder; the utmost manifestation of surprise was a cluck with\r\nthe tongue.[126] Upon presenting the governor with a vest, he\r\nimmediately cut off the buttons, and, dividing the cloth into four\r\nparts, shared it with his fellows.[127] When it rained they invariably\r\ntook off their ponchos, but in all our intercourse with these wild men\r\nwe never noticed the slightest breach of modesty. They strictly\r\nmaintained a decent arrangement of such apparel as they possessed. A\r\ncanoe containing a young Indian, his bride, and our governor's wife and\r\nbabe, accompanied us down to the Marañon. They were going after a load\r\nof salt for Sandoval. The girl was a graceful paddler, and had some\r\nwell-founded pretensions to beauty. Her coarse, black hair was simply\r\ncombed back, not braided into plaits as commonly done by the Andean\r\nwomen. All, both male and female, painted their faces with achote to\r\nkeep off the sand-flies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Our Craft on the Napo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: Bates says the Mundurucus express surprise by making a\r\nclicking sound with their teeth, and Darwin observes that the Fuegians\r\nhave the habit of making a chuckling noise when pleased.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: The like perfect equality exists among the Fuegian\r\ntribes. \"A piece of cloth given to one is torn into shreds and\r\ndistributed, and no one individual becomes richer than\r\nanother.\"--_Darwin_.]\r\n\r\nPratt managed the helm (the governor could not work the Yankee notion)\r\nand the kitchen. At Santa Rosa we had added to our Quito stock of\r\nprovisions some manati-lard (bottled up in a joint of a bamboo) and\r\nsirup, and at Coca we took in three fowls, a bag of rice, and a bunch of\r\nbananas. So we fared sumptuously every day. We left Coca on Thanksgiving\r\nDay, November 28th, and to imitate our distant friends, we sacrificed an\r\nextra meal--fricasseed chicken, jerked beef, boiled yucas, bananas,\r\noranges, lemonade, and guayusa. Favored by a powerful current and the\r\nrhythmic paddling of our Santa Rosans, we made this day sixty miles; but\r\nour average daily run was fifty miles. The winds (doubtless the trades)\r\nwere almost unchangeably from the east; but an occasional puff would\r\ncome from the northwest, when we relieved our paddlers by hoisting a\r\nblanket for a sail. Six o'clock was our usual hour of departure, and ten\r\nor twelve hours our traveling time, always tying up at a plaia or\r\nisland, of which there are hosts in the Napo, but never to the main\r\nland, for fear of unfriendly Indians and the still more unwelcome tiger.\r\nOur crew encamped at a respectful though hailing distance.\r\n\r\nOn the second day from Coca we were caught in a squall, and to save our\r\nroof we ran ashore. Nearly every afternoon we were treated to a shower,\r\naccompanied by a strong wind, but seldom by thunder and lightning,\r\nthough at Coca we had a brilliant thunder-storm at night. They always\r\ncame after a uniform fashion and at a regular hour, so that we learned\r\nwhen to expect them. About noon the eastern horizon would become\r\nsuddenly black, and when this had spread to the zenith we heard the\r\nrush of a mighty wind sweeping through the forest, and the crash of\r\nfalling trees, and then down fell the deluge. The Indians have a saying\r\nthat \"the path of the sun is the path of the storm.\" These storm-clouds\r\nmoved rapidly, for in half an hour all was quiet on the Napo. At Quito,\r\ntwo hundred miles west, the usual afternoon shower occurs two hours\r\nlater. To-day we enjoyed our last glimpse of the Andes. Far away across\r\nthe great forest we had traversed we could see the beautiful cone of\r\nCotopaxi and the flat top of Cayambi standing out in proud pre-eminence.\r\nLong will it be ere we forget this farewell view of the magnificent\r\nCordillera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n     Sea-Cows and Turtles' Eggs.--The Forest.--Peccaries.--Indian Tribes\r\n     on the Lower Napo.--Anacondas and Howling Monkeys.--Insect\r\n     Pests.--Battle with Ants.--Barometric Anomaly.--First View of the\r\n     Amazon,--Pebas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth of November was an exciting day on the monotonous Napo. We\r\nfell in with numerous sea-cows sporting in the middle of the stream.\r\nThey were greatly disturbed by the sight of our huge craft, and, lifting\r\ntheir ugly heads high out of the water, gave a peculiar snort, as if in\r\ndefiance, but always dived out of sight when fired upon. The sea-cow is\r\ncalled _vaca marina_ by the Spaniards, _peixe boy_ by the Brazilians,\r\nand _manati_ in the West Indies. It has no bovine feature except in its\r\nupper lip. The head and skin remind one of a large seal. In many\r\nrespects it may be likened to a hippopotamus without tusks or legs. It\r\nhas a semicircular flat tail, and behind the head are two oval fins,\r\nbeneath which are the breasts, which yield a white milk. The flesh\r\nresembles pork, with a disagreeable, fishy flavor.\r\n\r\nTo-day we anchored at several plaias to hunt turtles' eggs. Our Indians\r\nwere very expert in finding the nests. Guided approximately by the\r\ntracks of the _tortugas_, as the turtles are called, they thrust a stick\r\ninto the sand, and wherever it went down easily they immediately\r\ncommenced digging with their hands, and invariably \"struck\" eggs. In\r\nfour nests, whose contents we counted, there were one hundred and\r\nthirty-two, one hundred and fourteen, one hundred and twelve, and\r\nninety-seven; but we have heard of one hundred and sixty eggs in a\r\nsingle nest. The turtles lay in the night, and in pits about two feet\r\ndeep, which they excavate with their broad, webbed paws. The eggs are\r\nabout an inch and a half in diameter, having a thin, leathery shell, a\r\nvery oily yolk, and a white which does not coagulate. The Indians ate\r\nthem uncooked. We used them chiefly in making corn griddles.\r\n\r\nHere, as throughout its whole course, the Napo runs between two walls of\r\nevergreen verdure. On either hand are low clay banks (no rocks are\r\nvisible), and from these the forest rises to a uniform height of seventy\r\nor eighty feet. It has a more cheerful aspect than the sombre, silent\r\nwilderness of Baeza. Old aristocrats of the woods are overrun by a gay\r\ndemocracy of creepers and climbers, which interlace the entire forest,\r\nand, descending to take root again, appear like the shrouds and stays of\r\na line-of-battle ship. Monkeys gambol on this wild rigging, and mingle\r\ntheir chatter with the screams of the parrot. Trees as lofty as our oaks\r\nare covered with flowers as beautiful as our lilies. Here are orchids of\r\nsoftest tints;[128] flowering ferns, fifty feet high; the graceful\r\nbamboo and wild banana; while high over all countless species of palm\r\nwave their nodding plumes. Art could not arrange these beautiful forms\r\nso harmoniously as nature has done.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Some orchid is in flower all the year round. The finest\r\nspecies is the _odontoglossum_, having long, chocolate-colored petals,\r\nmargined with yellow. \"Such is their number and variety (wrote Humboldt)\r\nthat the entire life of a painter would be too short to delineate all\r\nthe magnificent Orchideæ which adorn the recesses of the deep valleys of\r\nthe Peruvian Andes.\" For many curious facts respecting the structure of\r\nthese flowers, see Darwin's _Fertilization of Orchids_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hunting Turtles' Eggs]\r\n\r\nThe tropics, moreover, are strangers to the uniformity of association\r\nseen in temperate climes. We have so many social plants that we speak of\r\na forest of oaks, and pines, and birches; but there variety is the law.\r\nIndividuals of the same species are seldom seen growing together.\r\nEvery tree is surrounded by strangers that seemingly prefer its room\r\nto its company; and, such is the struggle for possession of the soil, it\r\nis difficult to tell to which stem the different leaves and flowers\r\nbelong. The peculiar charm of a tropical forest is increased by the\r\nmystery of its impenetrable thicket. Within that dense, matted\r\nshrubbery, and behind that phalanx of trees, the imagination of the\r\ntraveler sees all manner of four-footed beasts and creeping things.\r\nTropical vegetation is of fresher verdure, more luxuriant and succulent,\r\nand adorned with larger and more shining leaves than the vegetation of\r\nthe north. The leaves are not shed periodically--a character common, not\r\nonly to the equator, but also to the whole southern hemisphere. Yet\r\nthere is a variety of tints, though not autumnal. The leaves put on\r\ntheir best attire while budding instead of falling--passing, as they\r\ncome to maturity, through different shades of red, brown, and green. The\r\nmajority of tropical trees bear small flowers. The most conspicuous\r\ntrees are the palms, to which the prize of beauty has been given by the\r\nconcurrent voice of all ages. The earliest civilization of mankind\r\nbelonged to countries bordering on the region of palms. South America,\r\nthe continent of mingled heat and moisture, excels the rest of the world\r\nin the number and perfection of her palms. They are mostly of the\r\nfeathery and fan-like species; the latter are inferior in rank to the\r\nformer. The peculiarly majestic character of the palm is given not only\r\nby their lofty stems, but also in a very high degree by the form and\r\narrangement of their leaves. How diverse, yet equally graceful, are the\r\naspiring branches of the jagua and the drooping foliage of the cocoa,\r\nthe shuttlecock-shaped crowns of the ubussú and the plumes of the\r\njupati, forty feet in length. The inflorescence always springs from the\r\ntop of the trunk, and the male flowers are generally yellowish. Unlike\r\nthe oak, all species of which have similar fruit, there is a vast\r\ndifference in the fruits of the palm: compare the triangular cocoa-nut,\r\nthe peach-like date, and grape-like assai. The silk-cotton tree is the\r\nrival of the palm in dignity; it has a white bark and a lofty flat\r\ncrown. Among the loveliest children of Flora we must include the mimosa,\r\nwith its delicately pinnated foliage, so endowed with sensibility that\r\nit seems to have stepped out of the bounds of vegetable life. The\r\nbamboo, the king of grasses, forms a distinctive feature in the\r\nlandscape of the Napo, frequently rising eighty feet in length, though\r\nnot in height, for the fronds curve downward. Fancy the airy grace of\r\nour meadow grasses united with the lordly growth of the poplar, and you\r\nhave a faint idea of bamboo beauty.\r\n\r\nThe first day of winter (how strangely that sounds under a vertical\r\nsun!) was Sunday; but it was folly to attempt to rest where punkies were\r\nas thick as atoms, so we floated on. It was only by keeping in mid-river\r\nand moving rapidly enough to create a breeze through our cabin, that\r\nlife was made tolerable. A little after noon we were again obliged to\r\ntie up for a storm. Not a human being nor a habitation have we seen\r\nsince leaving Coca; and to-day nothing is visible but the river, with\r\nits islands, and plains, and the green palisades--the edges of the\r\nboundless forest. Not a hill over one hundred feet high are we destined\r\nto see till we reach Obidos, fifteen hundred miles eastward. Were it not\r\nfor the wealth of vegetation--all new to trans-tropical eyes--and the\r\nconcerts of monkeys and macaws, oppressively lonely would be the sail\r\ndown the Napo between its uninhabited shores. But we believe the day,\r\nthough distant, will come when its banks will be busy with life. Toward\r\nevening three or four canoes pulled out from the shore and came\r\nalongside. They were filled with the lowest class of Indians we have\r\nseen in South America. The women were nearly nude; the man (there was\r\nonly one) had on a sleeveless frock reaching to the knees, made from the\r\nbark of a tree called _llanchama_. All were destitute of eyebrows; their\r\nhair was parted in the middle, and their teeth and lips were dyed black.\r\nThey had rude pottery, peccari meat, and wooden lances to sell. Like all\r\nthe Napo Indians, they had a weakness for beads, and they wore necklaces\r\nof tiger and monkey teeth. They were stupid rather than brutal, and\r\nprobably belonged to a degraded tribe of the great Zaparo family. With\r\nDarwin, \"one's mind hurries back over past centuries, and then asks,\r\ncould our progenitors have been men like these?--men whose very signs\r\nand expressions are less intelligible to us than those of the\r\ndomesticated animals; men who do not possess the instinct of those\r\nanimals, nor yet appear to boast of human reason, or, at least, of arts\r\nconsequent on that reason. I do not believe it is possible to describe\r\nor paint the difference between savage and civilized man. It is the\r\ndifference between a wild and tame animal; and part of the interest in\r\nbeholding a savage is the same which would lead every one to desire to\r\nsee the lion in his desert, the tiger tearing his prey in the jungle, or\r\nthe rhinoceros wandering over the wild plains of Africa.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morrow our falcon-eyed Indians whispered \"_cuche_\" long before we\r\nsaw any thing.[129] Williams went ashore and came upon a herd of\r\npeccaries, killing two. The peccari is a pugnacious, fearless animal. It\r\nis not frightened by the noise of fire-arms, and when wounded is a\r\ndangerous foe; but captured when young, it is easily tamed. It has a\r\nhigher back than the domestic hog, and cleanlier habits; an odoriferous\r\ngland on the loins, and three-toed hind feet. We preserved the skins for\r\nscience and a ham for the table; the rest we gave to our crew and\r\nfellow-voyagers, who devoured every thing, even the viscera. They sat\r\nup late that night, around their camp-fire, cooking peccari meat: part\r\nthey parboiled in a pot, and some they roasted, skewered on sticks which\r\nslanted over the flames; the rest they cured with smoke, for lack of\r\nsalt. The meat, though rank, is palatable, but not equal to macaw, which\r\nwe served up the next day.[130]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: In the Quichua of Quito the peccari is called _saino_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: The Uaupes on the Napo, according to Wallace, will not\r\neat peccari meat. \"Meat putrifies in this climate (of the Tapajos) in\r\nless than twenty-four hours, and salting is of no use unless the pieces\r\nare cut in thin slices and dried immediately in the sun.\"--_Bates_.]\r\n\r\nWe had now passed the mouth of the Aguarico, leaving behind us the\r\nChristian Quitus and the peaceful Zaparos. Henceforth the right bank of\r\nthe Napo is inhabited by the Mazanes and Iquitos; while on the left are\r\nthe wilder Santa Marias, Anguteros, Oritos, and Orejones. The Orejones,\r\nor \"Big Ears,\" enlarge those appendages to such an extent that they are\r\nsaid to lie down on one ear and cover themselves with the other. This\r\npractice is now going out of fashion. These Indians received their name,\r\nOrejones, or Oregones, from the Spaniards, on account of this singular\r\ncustom of inserting disks of wood in the ears to enlarge them; the like\r\npractice prevailed among the tribes on the Columbia River, Oregon. They\r\ntrade in hammocks, poisons, and provisions. The Anguteros, or Putumayos,\r\nhave a bad reputation. They are reported to have killed and robbed\r\nsarsaparilla traders coming up stream. Nevertheless, we kept watch only\r\none night during the voyage, though we always anchored to an island, and\r\nbetween Coca and the Amazon we did not see twenty-five men. Equally rare\r\nwere the savage brutes--not a jaguar showed himself, and only one\r\nanaconda. The anaconda, or water-boa (_Eunectes murinus_[131]), is\r\nlarger and more formidable than the boa-constrictor which lives on the\r\nland. It has a hideous appearance, broad in the middle, and tapering\r\nabruptly at both ends. We did not learn from the natives that anacondas\r\nover twenty feet long had been seen on the Napo, but specimens twice\r\nthat size are found on the Amazon. Land boas do not often exceed fifteen\r\nfeet in length.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: The specific name was strangely given for its habit, when\r\nyoung, of darting upon mice. Anaconda is a Ceylonese word.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Howler.]\r\n\r\nGangs of the large howling monkeys often entertained us with their\r\nterrific, unearthly yells, which, in the truthful language of Bates,\r\n\"increased tenfold the feeling of inhospitable wildness which the forest\r\nis calculated to inspire.\" They are of a maroon color (the males wear a\r\nlong red beard), and have under the jaw a bony goître--an expansion of\r\nthe os hyoides--by means of which they produce their loud, rolling\r\nnoise. They set up an unusual chorus whenever they saw us, scampering to\r\nthe tops of the highest trees, the dams carrying the young upon their\r\nbacks. They are the only monkeys which the natives have not been able to\r\ntame. Vast numbers of screaming parrots and macaws flew over our heads,\r\nalways going in pairs and at a great height. Groups of \"gypsy-birds\"\r\nwere perched on the trees overhanging the river, and black ducks,\r\ncormorants, and white cranes floated on the water or stalked along the\r\nplaias.\r\n\r\nBut one form of life superabounded. From the rising of the sun to the\r\ngoing down thereof clouds of ubiquitous sand-flies filled our cabin,\r\nsave when the wind was high. As soon as the sand-flies ceased, myriads\r\nof musquitoes began their work of torture, without much preparatory\r\npiping, and kept it up all night.[132] These pests were occasionally\r\nrelieved or assisted by piums--minute flies that alight unnoticed, and\r\nsquatting close to the skin, suck their fill of blood, leaving dark\r\nspots and a disagreeable irritation. Our hands were nearly black with\r\ntheir punctures. We also made the acquaintance of the montúca, a large\r\nblack fly whose horny lancets make a gash in the flesh, painless but\r\nblood-letting. All these insects are most abundant in the latter part of\r\nthe rainy season, when the Marañon is almost uninhabitable. The\r\napostrophe of Midshipman Wilberforce was prompted by sufferings which we\r\ncan fully appreciate: \"Ye greedy animals! I am ashamed of you. Can not\r\nyou once forego your dinner, and feast your mind with the poetry of the\r\nlandscape?\" Right welcome was the usual afternoon squall, which sent\r\nthese pests \"kiting\" over the stern.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Sand-flies are called by the natives _musquitoes_, and\r\nwhat we call musquitoes they call _sancudos_.]\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday we fell in with a petty sarsaparilla trader, with two\r\ncanoes, bound for the Marañon. He was sick with fever. Sarsaparilla\r\n(written _salsaparrilha_ in Brazil, and meaning \"bramble vine\") is the\r\nroot of a prickly, climbing plant found throughout the whole Amazonian\r\nforest, but chiefly on dry, rocky ground. On the morning of the seventh\r\nday from Coca we passed the mouth of the Curaray, the largest tributary\r\nof the Napo. It rises on the slopes of the Llanganati mountains, and is\r\nconsidered auriferous. It is probably derived from _curi_, gold. Seeing\r\na hut on the banks, we sent an Indian to purchase provisions; he\r\nreturned with a few yucas and eggs. The day following we were attacked\r\nfrom a new quarter. Stopping to escape a storm, a party went ashore to\r\ncut down a tree of which we desired a section. It fell with its top in\r\nthe river, just above our craft; when lo! to our consternation, down\r\ncame countless hosts of ants (_Ecitons_). Myriads were, of course, swept\r\ndown stream, but myriads more crawled up the sides of our canoes, and in\r\none minute after the tree fell our whole establishment, from hold to\r\nroof, was swarming with ants. We gave one look of despair at each other,\r\nour provisions and collections, and then commenced a war of\r\nextermination. It was a battle for life. The ants, whose nest we had so\r\nsuddenly immersed in the Napo, refused to quit their new lodgings. As we\r\nwere loosely dressed, the tenacious little creatures hid themselves\r\nunder our clothing, and when plucked off would leave their heads and\r\njaws sticking in the skin. At last the deck was cleared by means of\r\nboots, slippers, and towels; but, had the ants persevered, they might\r\nhave taken possession of the boat.\r\n\r\nTo-day we saw a high bank (called in Quichua _pucaurcu_, or red hill)\r\nconsisting of fine laminated clays of many colors--red, orange, yellow,\r\ngray, black, and white. This is the beginning of that vast deposit which\r\ncovers the whole Amazonian Valley. It rests upon a bed of lignite, or\r\nbituminous shale, and a coarse, iron-cemented conglomerate. The latter\r\nis not visible on the Napo, but crops out particularly at Obidos and\r\nPará. The Indians prepare their paints from these colored clays.\r\n\r\nOur Santa Rosans seemed to have little tact in fishing; still their\r\nspears and our hooks gathered not a few representatives of ichthyic life\r\nin the Napo. The species most common belong to the genus _Pimelodus_,\r\nor catfish tribe. Below tho Curaray the sand bars yielded turtles' eggs\r\nof a different kind from those found above, the _tracajá_. They were\r\nsmaller and oval, and buried only six or eight inches deep, thirty in a\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nDecember 9.--Passed early this morning the mouth of the Mazan; four huts\r\nat the junction. To-day we noticed the anomaly first observed by\r\nHerndon. From Papallacta to the Curaray the rise of the mercury was\r\nregular, but on the lower Napo there were great fluctuations. At one\r\ntime both barometer and boiling apparatus, with which we made daily and\r\nsimultaneous observations, unanimously declared that our canoes were\r\ngliding up stream, though we were descending at the rate of five miles\r\nan hour. The temperature is decidedly lower and the winds are stronger\r\nas we near the Amazon.\r\n\r\nDecember 10.--Our last day on the Napo. In celebration of the event we\r\nkilled a fine young doe as it was crossing the river. It closely\r\nresembled the Virginia deer. At 9 A.M. the Indians shouted in their\r\nquiet way--\"_Marañon_!\" It was as thrilling as _Thalatta_ to Xenophon's\r\nsoldiers. We were not expecting to reach it till night, being deceived\r\nby Villavicencio's map, which, in common with all others, locates the\r\nCuraray and Mazan too far to the north. We halted for an hour at\r\nCamindo, a little fishing hamlet claimed by Peru, and then hastened to\r\nget our first sight of the Amazon. With emotions we can not express, we\r\ngazed upon this ocean-stream. The march of the great river in its silent\r\ngrandeur is sublime. In its untamed might it rolls through the\r\nwilderness with a stately, solemn air, showing its awful power in\r\ncutting away the banks, tearing down trees, and building up islands in a\r\nday. Down the river we can look till the sky and water meet as on the\r\nsea, while the forest on either hand dwindles in the perspective to a\r\nlong black line. Between these even walls of ever-living green the\r\nresistless current hurries out of Peru, sweeps past the imperial guns of\r\nTabatinga into Brazil, and plows its way visibly two hundred miles into\r\nthe Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAt a small island standing where the Napo pays tribute to the monarch of\r\nrivers, mingling its waters with the Huallaga and Ucayali, which have\r\nalready come down from the Peruvian Andes, we bade adieu to our captain\r\nand cook, who, in the little canoe, paddled his way westward to seek his\r\nfortune in Iquitus. At this point the Marañon (for so the natives call\r\nthe Upper Amazon) does not appear very much broader than the Napo; but\r\nits depth is far greater, and there are few sand-bars.[133] The water is\r\nalways of a turbid yellow; while the Napo, though muddy during our\r\nvoyage, is usually clear. The forest, moreover, on the banks of the\r\nMarañon, is not so striking as on the tributary. The palms are not so\r\nnumerous, and the uniform height of the trees gives a monotonous,\r\nsea-like horizon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Herndon makes the mouth of the Napo 150 yards broad, and\r\nthe soundings six or seven fathoms. This is not a fair representation;\r\nfor the Napo, like all the other tributaries, empties its waters by\r\nseveral mouths. At Camindo, five miles above the confluence, the Napo is\r\ncertainly a mile wide.]\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Pebas December 12, ten hours after leaving the mouth of\r\nthe Napo, and a month and a half from Quito. The first individual we met\r\naddressed us in good English, and proved to be Mr. Hauxwell of birds and\r\ninsects, who has resided thirty years on the Amazon. His house, the\r\nlargest and best in town, though but a roofed stockade, was generously\r\nplaced at our disposal, and the fatted calf--an immense turtle--was\r\nimmediately killed. To us, after the transit of the Andes and the\r\ndangers and hardships of the wilderness and the river, it seemed as if\r\nwe had reached the end of our journey, though we were over two thousand\r\nmiles from the Atlantic. Pebas is situated on a high clay bluff beside\r\nthe Ambiyacu, a mile above its entrance into the Marañon. Excepting Mr.\r\nHauxwell, the Peruvian governor, and two or three other whites, the\r\ninhabitants are Indians of the Orejones and Yagua tribes. The\r\nexportations are hammocks, sarsaparilla, palo de cruz, and urarí. Palo\r\nde cruz is the very hard, dark-colored wood of a small leguminous tree\r\nbearing large pink flowers. Urarí is the poison used by all the\r\nAmazonian Indians; it is made by the Ticunas on the Putumayo, by boiling\r\nto a jelly the juices of certain roots and herbs, chiefly of the\r\n_Strychnos toxifera_, though it does not contain any trace of\r\nstrychnine. Tipped with urarí, the needle-like arrow used in blow-guns\r\nwill kill an ox in twenty minutes and a monkey in ten. \"We have reason\r\nto congratulate ourselves (wrote the facetious Sidney Smith) that our\r\nmethod of terminating disputes is by sword and pistol, and not by these\r\nmedicated pins.\" But the poison appears to be harmless to man and other\r\nsalt-eating animals, salt being an antidote.[134] We were not troubled\r\nwith sand-flies after leaving the plaias of the Napo, but the musquitoes\r\nat Pebas were supernumerary. Perhaps, however, it was a special\r\ngathering on our account, for the natives have a notion that just before\r\nthe arrival of a foreigner the musquitoes come in great numbers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: Urarí is mentioned by Raleigh. Humboldt was the first to\r\ntake any considerable quantity to Europe. The experiments of Virchau and\r\nMünster make it probable that it does not belong to the class of tetanic\r\npoisons, but that its particular effect is to take away the power of\r\nvoluntary muscular movement, while the involuntary functions of the\r\nheart and intestines still continue. See _Ann. de Chim. et de Phys._, t.\r\nxxxix., 1828, p. 24; and Schömberg's _Reisen in Britisch Guiana_, th.\r\ni., s. 441. The frightful poison, _tieuté_ of India, is prepared from a\r\nJava species of _strychnos_.]\r\n\r\nMany of the Indians are disfigured by dark blotches on the skin, the\r\neffect of a cutaneous disease very prevalent in Central Amazonia. Here\r\nwe first noticed the singular habit among the children of eating clay.\r\nThis habit is not confined to the Otomacs on the Oronoco, nor to Indians\r\naltogether; for negroes and whites have the same propensity--Mr.\r\nHauxwell found it impossible to restrain his own children. Bates\r\nascribes the morbid craving to the meagre diet. This may be true to some\r\nextent, but it is certainly strange that the extraordinary desire to\r\nswallow earth (chiefly unctuous clays) is found only in the tropics,\r\nwhere vegetation is so rank and fruit so abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n     Down the Amazon.--Steam on the Great River.--Loreto.--San\r\n     Antonio.--Tabatinga.--Brazilian Steamers.--Scenery on the\r\n     Amazon.--Tocantíns.--Fonte Boa.--Ega.--Rio Negro.--Manáos.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Pebas for Tabatinga in the Peruvian steamer \"Morona,\" Captain\r\nRaygado. Going up to Jerusalem by railroad, or ascending the Nile by a\r\nscrew whisking the sacred waters, is not so startling as the sight of a\r\nsteamer in the heart of South America. There is such a contrast between\r\nthe primeval wildness of the country and the people and this triumph of\r\ncivilized life; and one looks forward to the dazzling future of this\r\ngreat valley, when the ships of all nations will crowd the network of\r\nrivers for the gold and perfumes, the gems and woods of this western\r\nOphir. The natives call the steamer the \"devil's boat,\" or \"big canoe;\"\r\nbut they manifest little curiosity. Our Napo Indians were evidently\r\nafraid of it, and stood afar off. The first steamers that broke the deep\r\nsolitude of the Marañon were the \"Huallaga\" and \"Tirado,\" brought out in\r\n1853 by Dr. Whittemore, for Peru. They were built in New York, of\r\nGeorgia pine, costing Peru $75,000, and reflected no credit on the\r\nUnited States; they lie rotting near Nauta. Peru has now two iron\r\nsteamers of London make--the \"Morona\" and \"Pastassa\"--besides two\r\nsmaller craft for exploring the tributaries. These steamers are for\r\ngovernment service, but three more are building in England with\r\npassenger accommodations. The \"Morona\" has a tonnage of five hundred,\r\nand an engine of one hundred and fifty horse-power. The engineers are\r\nEnglish, and the cook is a Chinaman. She makes monthly trips between\r\nYurimaguas, on the Huallaga River, and Tabatinga, on the Brazilian\r\nfrontier. Her rate down stream is eighteen miles an hour, and from\r\neleven to twelve against the current. These steamers do not pay expenses\r\nat present; but they preserve the authority of Peru on the Marañon, and\r\nsupply with material the government works at Iquitos. They also do a\r\nlittle commerce, taking down sarsaparilla and Moyabamba hats, and\r\nbringing up English dry-goods. There were not half a dozen passengers on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThe only towns of any consequence west of Pebas are Iquitos, Nauta, and\r\nYurimaguas. Peru claims them--in fact, all the villages on the Marañon.\r\nIquitos is the most thriving town on the Upper Amazon. It is situated on\r\nan elevated plain on the left bank of the river, sixty miles above the\r\nmouth of the Napo. In Herndon's time it was \"a fishing village of 227\r\ninhabitants;\" it now contains 2000. Here are the government iron-works,\r\ncarried on by English mechanics. In 1867 there were six engineers, two\r\niron-molders, two brass-molders, two coppersmiths, three blacksmiths,\r\nthree pattern-makers, two boiler-makers, five shipwrights, three\r\nsawyers, besides bricklayers, brick-makers, carpenters, coopers, etc.;\r\nin all forty-two. All the coal for the furnaces is brought from\r\nEngland--the lignite on the banks of the Marañon is unfit for the\r\npurpose. A floating dock for vessels of a thousand tons has just been\r\nbuilt. Nauta lies on the north bank of the Marañon, opposite the\r\nentrance of the Ucayali. Its inhabitants, about 1000, trade in fish,\r\nsarsaparilla, and wax from Ucayali. Yurimaguas is the port of Moyabamba,\r\na city of 10,000 souls, six days' travel southwest. This vast eastern\r\nslope, lying on the branches of the Marañon, is called the Montaña of\r\nPeru. It is a region of inexhaustible fertility, and would yield ample\r\nreturns to energy and capital. The villages are open to foreign\r\ncommerce, free of duty; but at present the voice of civilized man is\r\nseldom heard, save on the main fluvial highway between Moyabamba and the\r\nBrazilian frontier. The Portuguese are the most adventurous traders. The\r\nvalue of imports to Peru by the Amazonian steamers during 1867 was\r\n$324,533; of exports, $267,748.\r\n\r\nIn two hours and a half we arrive at Maucallacta, or \"Old Town,\" an\r\nIndian village on the right bank of the river. Here our passports were\r\nviséd by the Peruvian governor, and the steamer wooded up. One of the\r\nhands on the \"Morona\" was Manuel Medina, a mameluco, who was employed by\r\nBates and Agassiz in their explorations. We left at noon of the\r\nfollowing day, and anchored for the night off Caballococha, for the\r\nPeruvian steamers run only in the daytime. Caballococha, or\r\n\"Horse-lake,\" is a Ticuna town, situated on a level tract of light loam,\r\nclosely surrounded by the dense forest, and beside a caño of clear water\r\nleading to a pretty lake. Ecuador claims this town, and likewise all the\r\nsettlements on the Marañon; but her learned geographer, Villavicencio,\r\nwith characteristic ignorance of the country, has located it on the\r\n_north_ bank of the river!\r\n\r\nWe passed in the afternoon the little tug \"Napo,\" having on board\r\nAdmiral Tucker, the rebel, who, with some associates, is exploring the\r\ntributaries of the Upper Amazon for the Peruvian government. They had\r\njust returned from a voyage of two hundred and fifty miles up the\r\nJavarí. One of the party had a tame tiger-cat in his arms. We arrived at\r\nLoreto early the next morning. This village of twenty houses and a\r\nchurch is prettily situated on the left bank, with a green slope in\r\nfront. It is the most easterly town of Peru on the Amazon. Here resides\r\nMr. Wilkens, the Brazilian consul, of German birth, but North American\r\neducation. The inhabitants are Peruvians, Portuguese, Negroes, and\r\nTicuna Indians. The musquitoes hold high carnival at this place. In two\r\nhours we were at San Antonio, a military post on the Peruvian frontier,\r\ncommanded by a French engineer, Manuel Charon, who also studied in the\r\nUnited States. One large building, and a flag-staff on a high bluff of\r\nred clay, were all that was visible of San Antonio; but the \"Morona\"\r\nbrought down a gang of Indians (impressed, no doubt) to build a fort for\r\ntwenty guns. The site is in dispute, a Brazilian claiming it as private\r\nproperty. The white barracks of Tabatinga, the first fortress in Brazil,\r\nare in plain sight, the voyage consuming but twenty minutes. Between San\r\nAntonio and Tabatinga is a ravine, on either side of which is a white\r\npole, marking the limits of the republic and the empire.\r\n\r\nTabatinga has long been a military post, but, excepting the government\r\nbuildings, there are not a dozen houses. Numerous Indians, however, of\r\nthe Ticuna tribe, dwell in the neighboring forest. The commandante was O\r\nIllustrissimo Señor Tenente Aristides Juste Mavignier, a tall, thin,\r\nstooping officer, dressed in brown linen. He received us with great\r\ncivility, and tendered a house and servant during our stay in port. We\r\npreferred, however, to accept the hospitalities of the \"Morona\" till the\r\narrival of the Brazilian steamer. Señor Mavignier was commandante of\r\nManáos when visited by Agassiz, and presented the Professor with a\r\nhundred varieties of wood. With the like courtesy, he gave us a\r\ncollection of reptiles, all of them rare, and many of them new species.\r\nHe showed us also a live raposa, or wild dog, peculiar to the Amazon,\r\nbut seldom seen. Tabatinga stands on an eminence of yellow clay, and is\r\ndefended by twelve guns. The river in front is quite narrow, only about\r\nhalf a mile wide. Here our passports, which had been signed at\r\nMaucallacta and Loreto, were indorsed by the commandante. They were\r\nafterward examined at Ega, Manáos, and Pará. The mean temperature of\r\nTabatinga we found to be 82°.[135] Some rubber and salt fish are\r\nexported, but nothing of consequence is cultivated. Grapes, the people\r\nsay, grow well, but are destroyed by the ants. The only fruit-trees we\r\nnoticed were the mamaï (in Spanish, papaya), aracá, and abío. The\r\npapaw-tree bears male and female flowers on different trees, and hence\r\nreceives the name of _papaya_ or _mamaï_, according to one's view of the\r\npre-eminence of the sex. The juice of this tree is used by the ladies of\r\nthe West Indies as a cosmetic, and by the butchers to render the\r\ntoughest meat tender. The fruit is melon-shaped, and of an orange-yellow\r\ncolor. Vauquelin discovered in it _fibrine_, till lately supposed to be\r\nconfined to the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: According to Lieutenant Azevedo, the latitude of\r\nTabatinga is 4° 14' 30\"; longitude, 70° 2' 24\"; magnetic variation, 6°\r\n35' 10\" N.E.]\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian steamers connect at Tabatinga with the Brazilian line.\r\nThere are eight imperial steamers on the Amazon: the \"Icamiaba,\" running\r\nbetween Tabatinga and Manáos; the \"Tapajos\" and \"Belem,\" plying between\r\nManáos and Pará; the \"Inca\" and \"Manáos,\" between Obidos and Pará;\r\nbesides two steamers on the Tocantíns, one between Pará and Chares, and\r\nprojected lines for the Negro, Tapajos, and Madeira. The captains get a\r\nsmall salary, but the perquisites are large, as they have a percentage\r\non the freight. One captain pocketed in one year $9000.\r\n\r\nWe embarked, December 12, on the \"Icamiaba,\" which promptly arrived at\r\nTabatinga. The commander, formerly a lieutenant in the Imperial Navy,\r\nand for twelve years a popular officer on the Upper Amazon, was a\r\npolished gentleman, but rigid disciplinarian. As an example of\r\nBrazilian etiquette, we give his full address from one of our letters of\r\nintroduction:\r\n\r\n              \"Ilmo. Sr. Capn. de Fragata\r\n          Nuno Alvez Pereira de Mello Cardozo,\r\n               Digno Commandante de Vapor\r\n                       Icamiaba.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Icamiaba\" was an iron boat of four hundred and fifty tons, with two\r\nengines of fifty horse-power each. The engineer was an Austrian, yet the\r\ncaptain gave his orders in English, though neither could speak the\r\nlanguage. The saloon, with berths for twenty-five passengers, was above\r\ndeck, and open at both ends for ventilation. The passengers, however,\r\nusually swung their hammocks on the upper deck, which was covered by an\r\nawning. This was a delightfully breezy and commanding position; and\r\nthough every part of the steamer was in perfect order, this was\r\nscrupulously neat. Here the table was spread with every tropical luxury,\r\nand attentively served by young men in spotless attire. Happy the\r\ntraveler who sits at the table of Commandante Cardozo. The refreshment\r\nhours were: Coffee as soon as the passengers turned out of their\r\nhammocks, and sometimes before; breakfast at ten, dinner at five, and\r\ntea at eight. Live bullocks, fowls, and turtles were kept on board, so\r\nthat of fresh meat, particularly beef (the first we had tasted since\r\nleaving Quito), there was no lack. At breakfast we counted nine\r\ndifferent courses of meat. The Peruvian steamers are limited to turtle\r\nand salt fish. Rice and farina are extensively used in Brazil, but we\r\nsaw very little tapioca. Farina is the flour of the country, and is\r\neaten in hard, dry grains; it will not keep in any other form. It can\r\nnot be very nutritious, as it contains little gluten. All bread and\r\nbutter are imported from the United States and England. The captains of\r\nBrazilian steamers are their own stewards; and in the midst of other\r\nbusiness in port, they stop to negotiate for a chicken, or a dozen\r\neggs, with an Indian or Negro. The \"Icamiaba\" left Tabatinga with only\r\nthree first-class passengers, besides our own party. On no Amazon\r\nsteamer did we meet with a lady passenger. Madame Godin, who came down\r\nthe river from the Andes, and Mrs. Agassiz, who ascended to Tabatinga,\r\nwere among the few ladies who have seen these upper waters. But how\r\ndifferently they traveled! one on a raft, the other on the beautiful\r\n\"Icamiaba.\"\r\n\r\nBetween Tabatinga and Teffé, a distance of five hundred miles, is\r\nperhaps the most uncivilized part of the main river. Ascending, we find\r\nimprovements multiply as we near the mountains of Peru; descending, we\r\nsee the march of civilization in the budding cities and expanding\r\ncommerce culminating at Grand Pará. The scenery from the deck of an\r\nAmazonian steamer, if described, appears monotonous. A vast volume of\r\nsmooth, yellow water, floating trees and beds of aquatic grass, low,\r\nlinear-shaped, wooded islets, a dark, even forest--the shores of a\r\nboundless sea of verdure, and a cloudless sky occasionally obscured by\r\nflocks of parrots: these are the general features. No busy towns are\r\nseen along the banks of the Middle Amazon; only here and there a palm\r\nhut or semi-Indian village half buried in the wilderness. We agree with\r\nDarwin (speaking of the Plata), that \"a wide expanse of muddy water has\r\nneither grandeur nor beauty.\" The real grandeur, however, of a great\r\nriver like this is derived from reflecting upon its prospective\r\ncommercial importance and its immense drainage. A lover of nature,\r\nmoreover, can never tire of gazing at the picturesque grouping and\r\nvariety of trees, with their mantles of creeping plants; while a little\r\nimagination can see in the alligators, ganoid fishes, sea-cows, and tall\r\ngray herons, the ichthyosaurus, holoptychius, dinotherium, and\r\nbrontozoum of ancient days. Here and there the river is bordered with\r\nlow alluvial deposits covered with feathery-topped arrow-grass and\r\namphibious vegetation; but generally the banks are about ten feet high\r\nand magnificently wooded; they are abrupt, and land-slides are frequent.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after leaving Tabatinga we passed the mouth of the Javarí,\r\nwhich forms the natural boundary between Peru and Brazil. Henceforth the\r\nriver loses the name of Marañon, and is called Solimoens, or, more\r\ncommonly, simply Amazon. We were ten hours in reaching San Paulo, a\r\nwretched Ticuna village of five hundred souls, built on a grassy\r\ntable-land nearly one hundred feet high. Steps have been cut in the\r\nslippery clay bluff to facilitate the ascent. Swamps lie back of the\r\ntown, rendering it unhealthy. \"On damp nights (says the Naturalist on\r\nthe Amazon) the chorus of frogs and toads which swarm in weedy\r\nback-yards creates such a bewildering uproar that it is impossible to\r\ncarry on a conversation in doors except by shouting.\"\r\n\r\nIn ten hours more we had passed the Putumayo and entered the Tunantíns,\r\na sluggish, dark-colored tributary emptying into the Amazon about two\r\nhundred miles below the Javarí.[136] On the bank of white earth, which\r\nstrongly contrasts with the tinted stream, is a dilapidated hamlet of\r\ntwenty-five hovels, built of bamboo plastered with mud and whitewashed.\r\nWe saw but one two-storied house; and all have ground-floors and\r\ndouble-thatched roofs. The inhabitants are semi-civilized Shumána and\r\nPassé Indians and half-breeds; but in the gloomy forest which hugs the\r\ntown live the wild Caishánas. The atmosphere is close and steaming, but\r\nnot hot, the mercury at noon standing at 83°. The place is alive with\r\ninsects and birds. The nights on the Amazon were invariably cool; on\r\nthe Lower Amazon, cold, so that we required a heavy blanket.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Herndon says (p. 241), \"the Tunantíns is about fifty\r\nyards broad, and seems deep with a considerable current.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kitchen on the Amazon.]\r\n\r\nTaking on board wood, beeves, turtles, salt fish, and water-melons, we\r\nleft at half past 2 P.M. The Brazilian steamers run all night, and with\r\nno slackening of speed. At one o'clock we were awakened by a cry from\r\nthe watch, \"Stop her!\" And immediately after there was a crash; but it\r\nwas only the breaking of crockery caused by the sudden stoppage. The\r\nnight was fearfully dark, and for aught we knew the steamer was running\r\nheadlong into the forest. Fortunately there was no collision, and in a\r\nfew minutes we were again on our way, arriving at Fonte Boa at 4 A.M.\r\nThis little village stands in a palm grove, on a high bank of\r\nochre-colored sandy clay, beside a slue of sluggish black water, eight\r\nmiles from the Amazon.[137] The inhabitants, about three hundred, are\r\nignorant, lazy mamelucos. They dress like the majority of the\r\nsemi-civilized people on the Amazon: the men content with shirt and\r\npantaloons, the women wearing cotton or gauze chemises and calico\r\npetticoats. Fonte Boa is a museum for the naturalist, but the\r\nheadquarters of musquitoes, small but persistent. Taking in a large\r\nquantity of turtle-oil, the \"Icamiaba\" turned down the caño, but almost\r\nimmediately ran aground, and we were two hours getting off. These yearly\r\nshifting shoals in the Amazon can not be laid down in charts, and the\r\nmost experienced pilots often run foul of them. In twelve hours we\r\nentered the Teffé, a tributary from the Bolivian mountains. Just before\r\nreaching the Great River it expands into a beautiful lake, with a white,\r\nsandy beach. On a grassy slope, stretching out into the lake, with a\r\nharbor on each side of it, lies the city of Ega. A hundred palm-thatched\r\ncottages of mud and tiled frame houses, each with an inclosed orchard of\r\norange, lemon, banana, and guava trees, surround a rude church, marked\r\nby a huge wooden crucifix on the green before it, instead of a steeple.\r\nCacao, assaï, and pupunha palms rise above the town, adding greatly to\r\nits beauty; while back of all, on the summit of the green slope, begins\r\nthe picturesque forest, pathless, save here and there a faint hunter's\r\ntrack leading to the untrodden interior. The sheep and cattle grazing on\r\nthe lawn, a rare sight in Alto Amazonas, gives a peaceful and inviting\r\naspect to the scene. The inhabitants, numbering about twelve hundred,\r\nare made up of pure Indians, half-castes, negroes, mulattoes, and\r\nwhites. Ega (also called Teffé) is the largest and most thriving town\r\nbetween Manáos and Iquitos, a distance of twelve hundred miles. It is\r\nalso one of the oldest settlements on the river, having been founded\r\nduring the English revolution, or nearly two centuries ago. Tupi is the\r\ncommon idiom. The productions of the country are cacao, sarsaparilla,\r\nBrazil nuts, bast for caulking vessels, copaiba balsam, India-rubber,\r\nsalt fish, turtle-oil, manati, grass hammocks, and tiles. Bates\r\ncalculates the value of the annual exports at nearly forty thousand\r\ndollars. The \"Icamiaba\" calls here twice a month; besides which there\r\nare small schooners which occupy about five months in the round trip\r\nbetween Ega and Pará. \"The place is healthy (writes the charming\r\nNaturalist on the Amazon), and almost free from insect pests; perpetual\r\nverdure surrounds it; the soil is of marvelous fertility, even for\r\nBrazil; the endless rivers and labyrinths of channels teem with fish and\r\nturtle; a fleet of steamers might anchor at any season of the year in\r\nthe lake, which has uninterrupted water communication straight to the\r\nAtlantic. What a future is in store for the sleepy little tropical\r\nvillage!\" Here Bates pursued butterflies for four years and a half, and\r\nAgassiz fished for six months.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: Smyth says the town gets its name from the clearness of\r\nthe water; but Herndon found it muddy, and, to our eyes, it was dark as\r\nthe Negro.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Natives on the Middle Amazon.]\r\n\r\nEga is the half-way point across the continent, but its exact altitude\r\nabove the sea is unknown. Herndon's boiling apparatus gave two thousand\r\nfeet, and, what is worse, the lieutenant believed it. Our barometer made\r\nit one hundred feet; but as our instrument, though perfect in itself,\r\nbehaved _very_ strangely on the Middle Amazon, we do not rely on the\r\ncalculation. The true height is not far from one hundred and twenty-five\r\nfeet, or one fifth the elevation of the middle point in the North\r\nAmerican continent.[138] Taking on board salt fish, turtle-oil, and\r\ntiles, we left Ega two hours after midnight, reaching Coary at noon.\r\nThe Amazon began to look more like a lake than a river, having a width\r\nof four or five miles. Floating gulls and rolling porpoises remind one\r\nof the sea. Coary is a huddle of fifteen houses, six of them plastered\r\nwithout, whitewashed, and tiled. It is situated on a lake of the same\r\nname--the expanded outlet of a small river whose waters are dark brown,\r\nand whose banks are low and covered with bushes. Here we took in turtles\r\nand turtle-oil, Brazil nuts and cocoa-nuts, rubber, salt fish, and wood;\r\nand, six hours after leaving, more fish and rubber were received at\r\nCudajá. Cudajá is a lonely spot on the edge of an extensive system of\r\nback-waters and lakes, running through a dense unexplored forest\r\ninhabited by Múra savages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: For a discussion of the barometric perturbations on the\r\nAmazon, see _American Journal of Science_ for Sept., 1868.]\r\n\r\nAt three in the afternoon of Christmas, seventy-four hours' running time\r\nfrom Tabatinga, we entered the Rio Negro. Strong is the contrast between\r\nits black-dyed waters and the yellow Amazon. The line separating the two\r\nrivers is sharply drawn, the waters meeting, not mingling. Circular\r\npatches of the dark waters of the Negro are seen floating like oil amid\r\nthe turbid waters of the Amazon. The sluggish tributary seems to be\r\ndammed up by the impetuous monarch. The banks of the latter are low,\r\nragged, perpendicular beds of clay, covered with a bright green foliage;\r\nthe Negro is fringed with sandy beaches, with hills in the background\r\nclothed with a sombre, monotonous forest containing few palms or\r\nleguminous trees. Musquitoes, piums, and montucas never trouble the\r\ntraveler on the inky stream. When seen in a tumbler, the water of the\r\nNegro is clear, but of a light-red color; due, undoubtedly, to vegetable\r\nmatter. The visible mouth of the river at this season of the year\r\n(December) is three miles wide, but from main-land to main-land it can\r\nnot be less than twenty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Siesta.]\r\n\r\nIn forty minutes after leaving the Amazon we arrived at Manáos. This\r\nimportant city lies on the left bank of the Negro, ten miles from its\r\nmouth and twenty feet above high-water level. The site is very uneven,\r\nand consists of ferruginous sandstone. There was originally a fort here,\r\nerected by the Portuguese to protect their slave-hunting expeditions\r\namong the Indians on the river--hence the ancient name of Barra. On the\r\nold map of Father Fritz (1707) the spot is named _Taromas_. Since 1852\r\nit has been called Manáos, after the most warlike tribe. Some of the\r\nhouses are two-storied, but the majority are low adobe structures, white\r\nand yellow washed, floored and roofed with tiles, and having green doors\r\nand shutters. Every room is furnished with hooks for hanging hammocks.\r\nWe did not see a bed between Quito and New York except on the steamers.\r\nThe population, numbering two thousand,[139] is a mongrel\r\nset--Brazilians, Portuguese, Italians, Jews, Negroes, and Indians, with\r\ndivers crosses between them. Laziness is the prominent characteristic. A\r\ngentleman offered an Indian passing his door twenty-five cents if he\r\nwould bring him a pitcher of water from the river, only a few rods\r\ndistant. He declined. \"But I will give you fifty cents.\" Whereupon the\r\nhalf-clothed, penniless aboriginal replied: \"I will give you a dollar to\r\nbring me some.\"[140] While every inch of the soil is of exuberant\r\nfertility, there is always a scarcity of food. It is the dearest spot on\r\nthe Amazon. Most of the essentials and all of the luxuries come from\r\nLiverpool, Lisbon, and New York. Agriculture is at a discount on the\r\nAmazon. Brazilians will not work; European immigrants are traders;\r\nnothing can be done with Indians; and negroes are few in number, the\r\nslave-trade being abolished, emancipation begun, and the Paraguayan war\r\nnot ended. A laboring class will ever be a desideratum in this tropical\r\ncountry. With a healthy climate,[141] and a situation at the juncture\r\nof two great navigable rivers, Manáos is destined to become the St.\r\nLouis of South America. In commercial advantages it is hardly to be\r\nsurpassed by any other city in the world, having water communication\r\nwith two thirds of the continent, and also with the Atlantic. It is now\r\nthe principal station for the Brazilian line of steamers. Here all goods\r\nfor a higher or lower point are reshipped. The chief articles of export\r\nare coffee (of superior quality), sarsaparilla, Brazil nuts, piassaba,\r\nand fish. The Negro at this point is really five or six miles wide, but\r\nthe opposite shore is masked by low islands, so that it appears to be\r\nbut a mile and a half.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Official returns for 1848 give 3614; Bates (1850) reckons\r\n3000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: Darwin met a similar specimen in Banda Oriental: \"I asked\r\ntwo men why they did not work. One gravely said the days were too long;\r\nthe other that he was too poor.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: It is, however, one of the warmest spots on the river.\r\nThe average temperature, according to Azevedo and Pinto, is only 79.7°;\r\nbut the highest point readied on the Amazon in 1862 (87.3°) was at\r\nManáos, and the extraordinary height of 95° has been noted there.]\r\n\r\nThe country around Manáos is quite romantic for the Amazonian Valley.\r\nThe land is undulating and furrowed by ravines, and the vegetation\r\ncovering it is marvelously rich and diversified. In the forest, two\r\nmiles from the city, there is a natural curiosity celebrated by all\r\ntravelers from Spix and Martius down. A rivulet coming out of the\r\nwilderness falls over a ledge of red sandstone ten feet high and fifty\r\nfeet broad, forming a beautiful cascade. The water is cool, and of a\r\ndeep orange color. The foundation of a fine stone cathedral was laid in\r\nManáos fourteen years ago, but this generation is not likely to witness\r\nthe dedication. Life in this Amazonian city is dull enough: commerce is\r\nnot brisk, and society is stiff; balls are about the only amusements. On\r\nSunday (the holiday) every body who can afford it comes out in Paris\r\nfashions. There are carts, hut no coaches. We called upon the President\r\nat his \"Palace\"--an odd term for a two-storied, whitewashed edifice. His\r\nexcellency received us with less formality and more cordiality than we\r\nexpected to find in the solemn officials of the empire. The first glance\r\nat the reception-room, with the four chairs for visitors set in two\r\nlines at right angles to the chair of state, promised cold etiquette;\r\nbut he addressed us with considerable familiarity and evident good-will.\r\nWe found, however, that his authority was quite limited, for a written\r\norder which he gave us for a subordinate did not receive the slightest\r\nconsideration. At the house of a Jew named Levy we met a party of\r\nSoutherners, Captains Mallory, Jones, Sandedge, and Winn, commanded by\r\nDr. Dowsing, who, since \"the late onpleasantness,\" as Nasby calls it,\r\nhave determined to settle in this country. The government grants them\r\ntwenty square leagues of land on any tributary, on condition that they\r\nwill colonize it. They were about to start for the Rio Branco on an\r\nexploring tour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n     Down the Amazon.--Serpa.--Villa Nova.--Obidos.--Santarem.--A Colony\r\n     of Southerners.--Monte Alégre.--Porto do Moz.--Leaving the\r\n     Amazon.--Breves.--Pará River.--The City of Pará.--Legislation and\r\n     Currency.--Religion and Education.--Nonpareil Climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 10 P.M. we left Manáos in the \"Tapajos,\" an iron steamer of seven\r\nhundred tons. We missed the snow-white cleanliness and rigid regularity\r\nof the \"Icamiaba,\" and Captain José Antunes Rodrigues de Oliveira\r\nCatramby was quite a contrast to Lieutenant Nuno. There were only five\r\nfirst-class passengers besides ourselves (and four of these were\r\n\"dead-heads\"), though there were accommodations for sixty-four. Between\r\nManáos and Pará, a distance of one thousand miles, there were fourteen\r\nadditions. Passing the mouth of the Madeira, the largest tributary to\r\nthe Amazon, we anchored thirty miles below at Serpa, after nine hours'\r\nsailing. Serpa is a village of ninety houses, built on a high bank of\r\nvariegated clay, whence its Indian name, _Ita-coatiara_, or painted\r\nrock. It was the most animated place we had seen on the river. The town\r\nis irregularly laid out and overrun with weeds, but there is a busy tile\r\nfactory, and the port was full of canoes, montarias, and cubertas. The\r\nAfrican element in the population began to show itself prominently here,\r\nand increased in importance as we neared Pará. The Negroes are very\r\nebony, and are employed as stevedores. The Indians are well-featured,\r\nand wear a long gown of bark-cloth reaching to the knees.\r\n\r\nTaking on board rubber and salt fish, the \"Tapajos\" steamed down stream,\r\npassing the perpendicular pink-clay cliffs of Cararaucú, arriving in\r\nten hours at Villa Nova,[142] one hundred and fifty miles below Serpa.\r\nVilla Nova is a straggling village of mud huts standing on a\r\nconglomerate bank. The trade is chiefly in rubber, copaiba, and fish.\r\nThe location is healthy, and in many respects is one of the most\r\ndesirable places on the river. Here the Amazon begins to narrow, being\r\nscarcely three miles wide; but the channel, which has a rocky bed, is\r\nvery deep. One hundred miles from Villa Nova is Obidos, airily situated\r\non a bluff of pink and yellow clay one hundred feet above the river. The\r\nclay rests on a white calcareous earth, and this on red sandstone. It is\r\na picturesque, substantially-built town, with a population, mostly\r\nwhite, engaged in raising cacao and cattle. Cacao is the most valuable\r\nproduct on the Amazon below Villa Nova. The soil is fertile, and the\r\nsurrounding forest is alive with monkeys, birds, and insects, and\r\nabounds with precious woods and fruits. Obidos is blessed with a church,\r\na school, and a weekly newspaper, and is defended by thirty-two guns.\r\nThis is the Thermopylæ of the Amazon, the great river contracting to a\r\nstrait not a mile in width, through which it rushes with tremendous\r\nvelocity. The depth is forty fathoms, and the current 2.4 feet per\r\nsecond. As Bates remarks, however, the river valley is not contracted to\r\nthis breadth, the southern shore not being continental land, but a low\r\nalluvial tract subject to inundation. Back of Obidos is an eminence\r\nwhich has been named _Mount Agassiz_ in honor of the Naturalist. There\r\nis no mountain between it and Cotopaxi save the spurs from the Eastern\r\nCordillera. Five miles above the town is the mouth of the Trombetas,\r\nwhere Orellana had his celebrated fight with the fabulous Amazons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Otherwise called, on Brazilian maps, Villa Bella da\r\nImperatriz.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Santarem.]\r\n\r\nAdding to her cargo wood, hides, horses, and Paraguayan prisoners\r\n(short, athletic men), the \"Tapajos\" sailed for Santarem. The river\r\nscenery below Obidos loses its wild and solitary character, and is\r\nrelieved with scattered habitations, factories, and cacao plantations.\r\nWe arrived at Santarem in seven hours from Obidos, a distance of fifty\r\nmiles. This city, the largest on the Amazon save Pará, stands on a\r\npretty slope at the mouth of the Rio Tapajos, and five hundred miles\r\nfrom the sea.[143] It mainly consists of three long-rows of whitewashed,\r\ntiled houses, girt with green gardens. The citizens, made up of\r\nBrazilians, Portuguese, mulattoes, and blacks, number about two thousand\r\nfive hundred. The surrounding country, which is an undulating campo,\r\nwith patches of wood, is sparsely inhabited by Tapajocos. Cattle estates\r\nand cacao plantations are the great investments, but the soil is poor.\r\nConsiderable sarsaparilla of superior quality, rubber, copaiba, Brazil\r\nnuts, and farina come down the Tapajos. The climate is delightful, the\r\ntrade-winds tempering the heat and driving away all insect pests.\r\nLeprosy is somewhat common among the poorer class. At Santarem is one of\r\nthe largest colonies which migrated from the disaffected Gulf States for\r\nBrazil. One hundred and sixty Southerners pitched their tents here. Many\r\nof them, however, were soon disgusted with the country, and, if we are\r\nto believe reports, the country was disgusted with them. On the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1868, only seventy-five remained. The colony does not fairly\r\nrepresent the United States, being made up in great part of the \"roughs\"\r\nof Mobile. A few are contented and are doing well. Amazonia will be\r\nindebted to them for some valuable ideas. Bates says: \"Butter-making is\r\nunknown in this country; the milk, I was told, was too poor.\" But these\r\nAnglo-Saxon immigrants have no difficulty in making butter. Santarem\r\nsends to Pará for sugar; but the cavaliers of Alabama are proving that\r\nthe sugar-cane grows better than in Louisiana, attaining the height of\r\ntwenty feet, and that it will yield for ten or twelve years without\r\ntransplanting or cultivation. It is not, however, so sweet or juicy as\r\nthe Southern cane. Some of the colonists are making tapioca and cashaça\r\nor Brazilian rum; others have gone into the pork business; while one,\r\nDr. Jones, expects to realize a fortune burning lime. Here we met the\r\nrebel ex-General Dobbins, who had been prospecting on the Tapajos River,\r\nbut had not yet located himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Herndon makes Santarem 460 miles from the Negro, and 650\r\nfrom the sea. Bates calls it 400 miles from the Atlantic, and nearly 50\r\nfrom Obidos.]\r\n\r\nBelow Santarem the Amazon vastly increases in width; at one point the\r\nsouthern shore was invisible from the steamer. The waves often run very\r\nhigh. At 10 A.M., eight hours from Santarem, we entered the romantic\r\nport of Monte Alégre. The road from the river to the village, just\r\nvisible inland, runs through a pretty dell. Back of the village, beyond\r\na low, swampy flat, rise the table-topped blue hills of Almeyrim. It was\r\nan exhilarating sight and a great relief to gaze upon a mountain range\r\nfrom three hundred to one thousand feet high, the greatest elevations\r\nalong the Amazon east of the Andes. Agassiz considers these singular\r\nmountains the remnants of a plain which once filled the whole valley of\r\nthe Amazon; but Bates believes them to be the southern terminus of the\r\nhigh land of Guiana. Their geological constitution--a pebbly\r\nsandstone--favors the Professor's theory. The range extends ninety miles\r\nalong the north bank of the river, the western limit at Monte Alégre\r\nbearing the local name of Serra Ereré. Mount Agassiz, at Obidos, is a\r\nspur of the same table-land. The Amazon is here about five miles wide,\r\nthe southern shore being low, uninhabited, and covered with coarse\r\ngrass. Five schooners were anchored in the harbor of Monte Alégre, a\r\nsign of considerable trade for the Amazon. The place exports cattle,\r\ncacao, rubber, and fish.\r\n\r\nIn four hours we reached Prayinha, a dilapidated village of forty\r\nhouses, situated on a low, sandy beach. The chief occupation is the\r\nmanufacture of turtle-oil. In ten hours more we were taking in wood at\r\nPorto do Moz, situated just within the mouth of the Xingú, the last\r\ngreat tributary to the Amazon. Dismal was our farewell sail on the great\r\nriver. With the highlands came foul weather. We were treated to frequent\r\nand furious showers, accompanied by a violent wind, and the atmosphere\r\nwas filled with smoke caused by numerous fires in the forest. Where the\r\nXingú comes in, the Amazon is ten miles wide, but it is soon divided by\r\na series of islands, the first of which is Grand Island. Twenty miles\r\nbelow Porto do Moz is Gurupá, where we took in rubber. The village,\r\nnearly as inanimate as Pompeii, consists of one street, half deserted,\r\nbuilt on an isolated site. Forty miles below Gurupá we left the Amazon\r\nproper, turning to the right down a narrow channel leading into the\r\nriver Pará. The forest became more luxuriant, the palms especially\r\nincreasing in number and beauty. At one place there was a forest of\r\npalms, a singularity, for trees of the same order are seldom associated.\r\nThe forest, densely packed and gloomy, stands on very low, flat banks of\r\nhard river mud. Scarcely a sign of animal life was visible; but, as we\r\nprogressed, dusky faces peered out of the woods; little shanties\r\nbelonging to the _seringeros_, or rubber-makers, here and there broke\r\nthe solitude, and occasionally a large group of half-clad natives\r\ngreeted us from the shore. A labyrinth of channels connects the Amazon\r\nwith the Pará; the steamers usually take the Tajapurú. This natural\r\ncanal is of great depth, and from fifty to one hundred yards in width;\r\nso that, hemmed in by two green walls, eighty feet-high, we seemed to\r\nbe sailing through a deep gorge; in some places it was so narrow it was\r\nnearly overarched by the foliage. One hundred and twenty-five miles from\r\nGurupá is Breves, a busy little town on the southwest corner of the\r\ngreat island of Marajó. The inhabitants, mostly Portuguese, are engaged\r\nin the rubber trade; the Indians in the vicinity manufacture fancy\r\nearthen-ware and painted cuyas or calabashes.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving Breves we entered the Pará River, which suddenly\r\nbegins with the enormous width of eight miles. It is, however, shallow,\r\nand contains numerous shoals and islands. It is properly an estuary,\r\nimmense volumes of fresh water flowing into it from the south. The tides\r\nare felt through its entire length of one hundred and sixty miles, but\r\nthe water is only slightly brackish. It has a dingy orange-brown color.\r\nA narrow blue line on our left, miles away, was all that was visible, at\r\ntimes, of the island of Marajó; and as we passed the broad mouth of the\r\nTocantíns, we were struck with the magnificent sea-like expanse, for\r\nthere was scarcely a point of mainland to be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pará.]\r\n\r\nAt 4 P.M., eighteen hours from Breves, we entered the peaceful bay of\r\nGoajara, and anchored in front of the city of Pará. Beautiful was the\r\nview of the city from the harbor in the rays of the declining sun. The\r\ntowering spires and cupolas, the palatial government buildings, the long\r\nrow of tall warehouses facing a fleet of schooners, ships, and steamers,\r\nand pretty white villas in the suburbs, nestling in luxuriant gardens,\r\nwere to us, who had just come down the Andes from mediæval Quito, the\r\n_ultima thule_ of civilization. We seemed to have stepped at once from\r\nthe Amazon to New York or London. We might, indeed, say _ne plus ultra_\r\nin one respect--we had crossed the continent, and Pará was the terminus\r\nof our wanderings, the end of romantic adventures, of privations and\r\nperils. We were kindly met on the pier by Mr. James Henderson, an\r\nelderly Scotchman, whom a long residence in Pará, a bottomless fund of\r\ninformation, and a readiness to serve an Anglo-Saxon, have made an\r\ninvaluable cicerone. We shot through the devious, narrow streets to the\r\nHotel Diana, where we made our toilet, for our habiliments, too, had\r\nreached their _ultima thule_. As La Condamine said on his arrival at\r\nQuito: \"_Je me trouvai hors d'état de paroitre en public avec décence_.\"\r\n\r\nThe same year which saw Shakspeare carried to his grave beside the Avon\r\nwitnessed the founding of Pará, or, speaking more respectfully, of Santa\r\nMaria de Belém do Gram Pará. The city stands on a low elbow of land\r\nformed by the junction of the rivers Guamá and Pará, seventy-five miles\r\nfrom the ocean. The great forest comes close up to the suburbs; and, in\r\nfact, vegetation is so rapid the city fathers have a hard struggle to\r\nkeep the jungle out of the streets. The river in front is twenty miles\r\nwide, but the vast expanse is broken by numerous islets. Ships of any\r\nsize will float within, one hundred and fifty yards of the shore. All\r\npassengers and goods are landed by boats at the custom-house wharf. The\r\ncity is regularly laid out, there are several public squares, and many\r\nof the streets, especially in the commercial part, are well paved.\r\nMagnificent avenues, lined with silk-cotton trees, cocoa-palms, and\r\nalmonds, lead out to beautiful _rocinhas_, or country residences, of one\r\nstory, but having spacious verandas. The President's house, built in the\r\nItalian style, whose marble staircase is a wonder to Brazil; the six\r\nlarge churches, including the cathedral, after patterns from Lisbon; the\r\npost-office, custom-house, and convent-looking warehouses on the\r\nmole--these are the most prominent buildings. The architecture is\r\nsuperior to that of Quito. The houses, generally two-storied, are\r\ntiled, plastered, and whitewashed or painted; the popular colors are\r\nred, yellow, and blue. A few have porcelain facing. The majority have\r\nelegant balconies and glass windows, but not all the old projecting\r\nlattice casements have disappeared. Some of the buildings bear the marks\r\nof the cannonading in the Revolution of 1835. Instead of bedrooms and\r\nbeds, the largest apartments and verandahs have hooks in the wall for\r\nhammocks. A carpeted, cushioned room is seldom seen, and is out of place\r\nin the tropics. Coaches and gas are supplanting ox-carts and candles.\r\nThere are two hotels, but scant accommodations for travelers. Beef is\r\nalmost the only meat used; the fish are poor and dear; the oysters are\r\nhorrible. Bananas, oranges, and coffee are the best native productions\r\non the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fruit Peddlers.]\r\n\r\nThe population of Pará is thirty-five thousand, or double what it was\r\nwhen Wallace and Bates entered it twenty years ago. It is the largest\r\ncity on the largest river in the world, and the capital of a province\r\nten times the size of New York State. The enterprising, wealthy class\r\nconsists of Portuguese and pure Brazilians, with a few English, Germans,\r\nFrench, and North Americans. The multitude is an amalgamation of\r\nPortuguese, Indian, and Negro. The diversity of races, and the mingled\r\ndialects of the Amazon and Europe, make an attractive street scene. Side\r\nby side we see the corpulent Brazilian planter, the swarthy Portuguese\r\ntrader, the merry Negro porter, and the apathetic Indian boatman. Some\r\nof the more recent offspring are dressed _à la Adam_ before the fall;\r\nnumbers wear only a shirt or skirt; the negro girls who go about the\r\nstreets with trays of sweetmeats on their heads are loosely yet prettily\r\ndressed in pure white, with massive gilded chains and earrings; but the\r\nmiddle and upper classes generally follow Paris fashions. The mechanic\r\narts are in the hands of free Negroes and Indians, mulattoes and\r\nmamelucos.[144] Commerce is carried on almost exclusively by Portuguese\r\nand other foreigners. Dry-goods come chiefly from England and France;\r\ngroceries from Portugal; flour and hardware from the United States. The\r\nprincipal exports are rubber, cacao, coffee,[145] sugar, cotton, Brazil\r\nnuts, sarsaparilla, vanilla, farina, copaiba, tobacco, rum, hides, fish,\r\nparrots, and monkeys.[146] Pará exceeds in the number of its indigenous\r\ncommodities any other port in the world, but the trade at present is\r\ninsignificant when we consider the vast extent and resources of the\r\ncountry. The city can never have a rival at the mouth of the Amazon, and\r\nis destined to become a great emporium. But Brazilian legislation stands\r\nin the way. Heavy import duties are charged--from 35 to 45 per cent.;\r\nand on the 1st of January, 1868, it was ordered that 15 per cent. must\r\nbe paid in English gold. The consequence has been that gold has risen\r\nfrom 28 to 30 above par, creating an additional tax. Exportation is\r\nequally discouraging. There is a duty of nine per cent. to be paid at\r\nthe custom-house, and seven per cent. more at the consulado. But this\r\nis not the sum total. Those who live outside of the province of Pará,\r\nsay above Obidos, must first pay an import of thirteen per cent. to get\r\ntheir produce into Pará. For example: up the river crude rubber can be\r\nbought for twenty-five cents a pound; the trader pays twenty-five cents\r\nan arroba (thirty-two pounds) for transportation to Pará from Santarem,\r\nexclusive of canoe hire and shipping; thirteen per cent. duty in\r\nentering Pará, ten per cent. to the commission merchant, and sixteen per\r\ncent. more as export tax; making a total loss on labor of about fifty\r\nper cent. Brazil abounds with the most valuable woods in the world, but\r\nis prevented from competing with other nations by this system of\r\nself-strangulation. In 1867 the import duty on timber was twelve per\r\ncent. Though situated on the edge of a boundless forest, Pará consumes\r\nlarge quantities of North American pine. There is not a grist-mill on\r\nthe Amazon, and only two or three saw-mills. A dozen boards of red cedar\r\n(a very common timber) costs 60$000 per thousand (about thirty dollars)\r\nat Santarem. There is no duty on goods going to Peru. The current money,\r\nbesides foreign gold, consists of copper coins and imperial treasury\r\nnotes. The basis of calculation is the imaginary _rey_, equivalent to\r\nhalf a mill. The coins in use are the vintem (twenty reys), answering to\r\nour cent, the half vintem, and double vintem. The currency has so\r\nfluctuated in value that many of the pieces have been restamped. Fifty\r\nvintems make a _milrey_, expressed thus: 1$000. This is the smallest\r\npaper issue. Unfortunately, the notes may suddenly fall below par. As a\r\ngreat many counterfeits made in Portugal are in circulation, the\r\ngovernment recalls the issue which has been counterfeited, notifying\r\nholders, by the provincial papers, that all such bills must be exchanged\r\nfor a new issue within six months. Those not brought in at the end of\r\nthat period lose ten per cent. of their value, and ten per cent. for\r\neach following month, until the value of the note is _nil_. The result\r\nhas been that many persons trading up the river have lost heavily, and\r\nnow demand hard money. Change is very scarce in Pará.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: We are inclined to doubt the assertion of Mansfield that\r\nParaguay is the only country in eastern South America with an\r\nindustrious peasantry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Brazil yields more than one half the quantity of coffee\r\nconsumed by the world. That of Ceará is the best.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: In January, 1868, the current prices were as follows:\r\n\r\nRefined Sugar, per arroba $3 00\r\nRice                       1 40\r\nCacao                      3 20\r\nCoffee                     3 50\r\nFarina                       75\r\nTapioca                    3 00\r\nPure rubber               11 50\r\nPlassaba cord              6 50\r\nTobacco                    1 50\r\nSarsparilla               11 50\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian arroba is seven pounds heavier than the Spanish.]\r\n\r\nThe province of Pará is governed by a president chosen at Rio, and every\r\nfour years sends representatives to the Imperial Parliament. The\r\nConstitution of Brazil is very liberal; every householder, without\r\ndistinction of race or color, has a vote, and may work his way up to\r\nhigh position. There are two drawbacks--the want of intelligence and\r\nvirtue in the people, and the immense staff of officials employed to\r\nadminister the government. There are also many formalities which are not\r\nonly useless, but a hinderance to prosperity. Thus, the internal trade\r\nof a province carried on by Brazilian subjects is not exempt from the\r\npassport system. A foreigner finds as much trouble in getting his\r\npassport _en règle_ in Pará as in Vienna. The religion of Pará is\r\nRomish, and not so tolerant as in Rio. We arrived during _festa_. (When\r\ndid a traveler enter a Portuguese town on any other than a feast day?)\r\nThat night was made hideous with rockets, fire-crackers, cannon, and\r\nbells. \"Music, noise, and fireworks,\" says Wallace, \"are the three\r\nessentials to please a Brazilian populace.\" The most celebrated shrine\r\nin Northern Brazil is Our Lady of Nazareth. The little chapel stands\r\nabout a mile out of the city, and is now rebuilding for the third time.\r\nThe image is a doll about the size of a girl ten years old, wearing a\r\nsilver crown and a dress of blue silk glittering with golden stars.\r\nHosts of miracles are attributed to Our Lady, and we were shown votive\r\nofferings and models of legs, arms, heads, etc., etc., the grateful _in\r\nmemoriam_ of wonderful cures, besides a boat whose crew were saved by\r\ninvoking the protection of Mary. The facilities for education are\r\nimproving. There are several seminaries in Pará, of which the chief is\r\nthe _Lyceo da Capital_. Too many youths, however, as in Quito, are\r\nsatisfied with a little rhetoric and law. The city supports four\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nParáenses may well be proud of their delightful climate. Wallace says\r\nthe thermometer ranges from 74° to 87°; our observation made the mean\r\nannual temperature 80.2°. The mean daily temperature does not vary more\r\nthan two or three degrees. The climate is more equable than that of any\r\nother observed part of the New World.[147] The greatest heat is reached\r\nat two o'clock, but it is never so oppressive as in New York. The\r\ngreater the heat, the stronger the sea-breeze; and in three hundred out\r\nof three hundred and sixty-five days, the air is farther cooled by an\r\nafternoon shower. The rainiest month is April; the dryest, October or\r\nNovember. Lying in the delta of a great river, in the middle of the\r\ntropics, and half surrounded by swamps, its salubrity is remarkable. We\r\nreadily excuse the proverb, \"_Quem vai para Pará para_\" (\"He who goes to\r\nPará stops there\"); and we might have made it good, had we not been\r\ntempted by the magnificent steamer \"South America,\" which came up from\r\nRio on the way to New York. On the moonlit night of the 7th of January,\r\nwhen the ice-king had thrown his white robes over the North, we turned\r\nour backs upon the glimmering lights of Pará, and noiselessly as a canoe\r\nglided down the great river. As the sun rose for the last time to us\r\nupon the land of perpetual verdure, our gallant ship was plowing the\r\nmottled waters on the edge of the ocean--mingled yellow patches of the\r\nAmazon and dark streaks from the Pará floating on the Atlantic green.\r\nFar behind us we could see the breakers dashing against the Braganza\r\nBanks; a moment after Cape Magoary dropped beneath the horizon, and with\r\nit South America vanished from our view.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: \"The traveler, in going from the equator toward the\r\ntropics, is less struck by the decrease of the mean annual temperature\r\nthan by the unequal distribution of heat in different parts of the\r\nyear.\"--_Humboldt_. The great German fixes the mean temperature of the\r\nequator at 81.5°; Brewster, at 82.8°; Kirwan, 83.9°; Atkinson, 84.5°.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n     The River Amazon.--Its Source and Magnitude.--Tributaries and\r\n     Tints.--Volume and Current.--Rise and\r\n     Fall.--Navigation.--Expeditions on the Great River.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the silver mines of Cerro Pasco, in the little Lake of Lauricocha,\r\njust below the limit of perpetual winter, rises the \"King of\r\nWaters.\"[148] For the first five hundred miles it flows northerly, in a\r\ncontinuous series of cataracts and rapids, through a deep valley between\r\nthe parallel Cordilleras of Peru. Upon reaching the frontier of Ecuador,\r\nit turns to the right, and runs easterly two thousand five hundred miles\r\nacross the great equatorial plain of the continent.[149] No other river\r\nflows in the same latitude, and retains, therefore, the same climatic\r\nconditions for so great a distance. The breadth of the Amazon, also, is\r\nwell proportioned to its extraordinary length. At Tabatinga, two\r\nthousand miles above its mouth, it is a mile and a half wide; at the\r\nentrance of the Madeira, it is three miles; below Santarem, it is ten;\r\nand if the Pará be considered a part of the great river, it fronts the\r\nAtlantic one hundred and eighty miles. Brazilians proudly call it the\r\nMediterranean of the New World. Its vast expanse, presenting below\r\nTeffé magnificent reaches, with blank horizons, and forming a barrier\r\nbetween different species of animals; its system of back channels,\r\njoining the tributaries, and linking a series of lagunes too many ever\r\nto be named; its network of navigable waters stretching over one third\r\nof the continent; its oceanic fauna--porpoises and manatis, gulls and\r\nfrigate-birds--remind the traveler of a great inland sea, with endless\r\nramifications, rather than a river. The side-channels through the\r\nforest, called by the Indians _igarapés_, or canoe-paths, are one of the\r\ncharacteristic features of the Amazon.[150] They often run to a great\r\ndistance parallel to the great river, and intersecting the tributaries,\r\nso that one can go from Santarem a thousand miles up the Amazon without\r\nonce entering it. These natural highways will be of immense advantage\r\nfor inter-communication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Igarapé, or Canoe-path.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: Herndon gives, for the altitude of Cerro Pasco, 13,802\r\nfeet; Rivero, 14,279. The lieutenant thus describes his first view from\r\nthe rough hills surrounding this birthplace of the greatest of rivers:\r\n\"I can compare it to nothing so fitly as looking from the broken and\r\nragged edges of a volcano into the crater beneath.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: From Lauricocha to its mouth, the Amazon, following the\r\nmain curves, is 2740 miles long, as estimated by Bates; in a straight\r\nline, 2050; from Pará to the head of the Ucayali, 3000. From north to\r\nsouth the tributaries stretch 1720 miles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: _Igarapé_ is sometimes limited to a creek filled with\r\nback-water; _paranamirim_ is the proper term for a narrow arm of the\r\nmain river; and _furos_ are the diminutive mouths of the tributaries.]\r\n\r\nBut extraordinary as is this network of natural canals, the tributaries\r\nof the Amazon are still more wonderful. They are so numerous they appear\r\non the map like a thousand ribbons streaming from a main mast, and many\r\nof the obscure affluents, though large as the Hudson, are unknown to\r\ngeography. From three degrees north to twenty degrees south, every river\r\nthat flows down the eastern slope of the Andes is a contributor--as\r\nthough all the rivers between Mexico and Mount Hooker united their\r\nwaters in the Mississippi. While the great river of the northern\r\ncontinent drains an area of one million two hundred thousand square\r\nmiles, the Amazon (not including the Tocantíns) is spread over a million\r\nmore, or over a surface equal to two thirds of all Europe. Let us\r\njourney around the grand trunk and take a glimpse of the main branches.\r\n\r\nThe first we meet in going up the left bank is the Rio Negro. It rises\r\nin the Sierra Tunuhy, an isolated mountain group in the llanos of\r\nColombia, and enters the Amazon at Manáos, a thousand miles from the\r\nsea. The upper part, down to the parallel of one degree north, has a\r\nvery rapid current; at San Gabriel are the first rapids in ascending;\r\nbetween San Gabriel and Barcellos the rate is not over two or three\r\nmiles per hour; between Barcellos and Manáos it is a deep but sluggish\r\nriver, and in the annual rise of the Amazon its waters are stagnant for\r\nseveral hundred miles up, or actually flow back. Its extreme length is\r\ntwelve hundred miles, and its greatest breadth is at Barcellos, where it\r\nis twelve or fifteen miles. Excepting this middle section, the usual\r\nbreadth of the Negro below the equatorial line is about one mile. It is\r\njoined to the Orinoco by the navigable Cassiquiari,[151] a natural canal\r\nthree fourths of a mile wide, and a portage of only two hours divides\r\nthe head of its tributary, the Branco, from the Essequibo of Guiana. The\r\nNegro yields to commerce coffee, cacao, farina, sarsaparilla, Brazil\r\nnuts, pitch, piassaba, and valuable woods. The commerce of Brazil with\r\nVenezuela by the Rio Negro amounted in 1867 to $22,000, of which $9000\r\nwas the value of imports. The principal villages above Manáos are San\r\nMiguel and Moroa (which contain about fifty dwellings each), Tireguin,\r\nBarcellos, Toma, San Carlos, Coana, San Gabriel, and Santa Isabel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: The Cassiquiari belongs indifferently to both river\r\nsystems, the level being so complete at one point between them as to\r\nobliterate the line of water-shed.--_Herschel_.]\r\n\r\nThe next great affluent is the Japurá. It rises in the mountains of New\r\nGranada, and, flowing southeasterly a thousand miles, enters the Amazon\r\nopposite Ega, five hundred miles above Manáos. Its principal mouth is\r\nthree hundred feet wide, but it has a host of distributing channels, the\r\nextremes of which are two hundred miles apart. Its current is only three\r\nquarters of a mile an hour, and it has been ascended by canoes five\r\nhundred miles. A natural canal like the Cassiquiari is said to connect\r\nit with the Orinoco. The products of the Japurá are sarsaparilla,\r\ncopaiba, rubber, cacao, farina, Brazil nuts, moira-piránga--a hard,\r\nfine-grained wood of a rich, cherry-red color--and carajurú, a brilliant\r\nscarlet dye.\r\n\r\nParallel to the Japurá is the Putumayo or Issá. Its source is the Lake\r\nof San Pablo, at the foot of the volcano of Pasto; its mouth, as given\r\nby Herndon, is half a mile broad, and its current two and three fourths\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nFarther west are the Napo and Pastassa, starting from the volcanoes of\r\nQuito. The former is nearly seven hundred miles long, navigable five\r\nhundred. The latter is an unnavigable torrent. One of its branches, the\r\nTopo, is one continued rapid; \"of those who have fallen into it, only\r\none has come out alive.\" Another, the Patate, rises near Iliniza, runs\r\nthrough the plain to a little south of Cotopaxi, receives all streams\r\nflowing from the eastern side of the western Cordillera from Iliniza to\r\nChimborazo, and unites near Tunguragua with the Chambo, which rises near\r\nSangaí. Castelnau and Bates saw pumice floating on the Amazon; it was\r\nprobably brought from Cotopaxi by the Pastassa.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Marañon, and going eastward, we first pass the Huallaga, a\r\nrapid river of the size of the Cumberland, coming down the Peruvian\r\nAndes from an altitude of eight thousand six hundred feet, and entering\r\nthe great river nearly opposite the Pastassa. Its mouth is a mile wide,\r\nand for a hundred miles up its average depth is three fathoms. In July,\r\nAugust, and September the steamers are not able to ascend to Yurimaguas.\r\nCanoe navigation begins at Tinga Maria, three hundred miles from Lima.\r\nThe fertile plain through which the river flows is very attractive to an\r\nagriculturist. Cotton is gathered six months after sowing, and rice in\r\nfive months. At Tarapoto a large amount of cotton-cloth is woven for\r\nexport.\r\n\r\nThe next great tributary from the south is the Ucayali. This magnificent\r\nstream originates near ancient Cuzco, and has a fall of .87 of a foot\r\nper mile, and a length nearly equal to that of the Negro. For two\r\nhundred and fifty miles above its mouth it averages half a mile in\r\nwidth, and has a current of three miles an hour. At Sarayacu it is\r\ntwenty feet deep. The Ucayali is navigable for at least seven hundred\r\nmiles. The \"Morona,\" a steamer of five hundred tons, has been up to the\r\nentrance of the Pachitéa in the dry season, a distance of six hundred\r\nmiles, and in the wet season ascended that branch to Mayro. A small\r\nPeruvian steamer has recently ascended the Tambo to within sixty miles\r\nof Fort Ramon, or seven hundred and seventy-three miles from Nauta.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Ucayali, we pass by six rivers rising in the unknown lands\r\nof Northern Bolivia: the Javarí, navigable by steam for two hundred and\r\nfifty miles; the sluggish Jutahí, half a mile broad and four hundred\r\nmiles long; the Juruá, four times the size of our Connecticut, and\r\nnavigable nearly its entire length; the unhealthy, little-known Teffé\r\nand Coary; and the Purus, a deep, slow river, over a thousand miles\r\nlong, and open to navigation half way to its source. Soldan and Pinto\r\nclaim to have ascended the Javarí, in a steamer, about one thousand\r\nmiles, and it is said Chandlers went up the Purus one thousand eight\r\nhundred miles. The Teffé is narrow, with a strong current. Of all these\r\nsix rivers, the Purus is the most important. It is probably the\r\nAmaru-mayu, or \"serpent-river,\" of the Incas, and its affluents enjoy\r\nthe privilege of draining the waters of those beautiful Andes which\r\nformed the eastern boundary of the empire of Manco Capac, and\r\nfertilizing the romantic valley of Paucar-tambo, or \"Inn of the Flowery\r\nMeadow.\" The banks of this noble stream are now held by the untamable\r\nChunchos; but the steam-whistle will accomplish what the rifle can not.\r\nThe Purus communicates with the Madeira, proving the absence of rapids\r\nand of intervening mountains.\r\n\r\nSixty miles below the confluence of the Negro, the mighty Madeira, the\r\nlargest tributary of the Amazon, blends its milky waters with the turbid\r\nking of rivers. It is about two thousand miles in length; one branch,\r\nthe Beni, rising near Lake Titicaca, drains the fertile valleys of\r\nYungus and Apollo, rich in cinchona, chocolate, and gold; the Marmoré\r\nsprings from the vicinity of Chuquisaca, within fifteen miles of a\r\nsource of the Paraguay, traversing the territory of the brave and\r\nintelligent Moxos; while the Itinez washes down the gold and diamonds of\r\nMatto Grosso. Were it not for the cascade four hundred and eighty miles\r\nfrom its mouth, large vessels might sail from the Amazon into the very\r\nheart of Bolivia. When full, it has a three-mile current, and at its\r\njunction with the Amazon it is two miles wide and sixty-six feet deep.\r\nFive hundred miles from its mouth it is a mile wide and one hundred feet\r\ndeep. It contains numerous islands, and runs in a comparatively straight\r\ncourse. It received its name from the vast quantity of drift-wood often\r\nseen floating down. The value of Brazilian commerce with Bolivia by the\r\nMadeira was, in 1867, $43,000.[152]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: In the map of Friar Fritz, published in 1707, the Madeira\r\nis one of the most insignificant of the tributaries, and the Ucayali and\r\nPutumayo are the largest.]\r\n\r\nAt Santarem the Amazon receives another great tributary, the Tapajos (or\r\nRio Preto, as the Portuguese call it), a thousand miles long, and, for\r\nthe last eighty miles, from four to twelve miles in breadth. It rises\r\namid the glittering mines of Matto Grosso, only twenty miles from the\r\nheadwaters of the Rio Plata, and flows rapidly down through a\r\nmagnificent hilly country to the last cataract, which is one hundred and\r\nsixty miles above Santarem, and is the end of navigation to sailing\r\nvessels. Thence to the Amazon it has little current and no great depth.\r\nFrom Santarem to Diamantino it is about twenty-six days' travel. Large\r\nquantities of sarsaparilla, rubber, tonka beans, mandioca, and guarana\r\nare brought down this river.\r\n\r\nParallel to the Tapajos, and about two hundred miles distant, flows the\r\nXingú. It rises in the heart of the empire, has the length of the Ohio\r\nand Monongahela, and can be navigated one hundred and fifty miles. This\r\nis the last great tributary of the Amazon proper; if, however, we\r\nconsider the Pará as only one of the outlets of the great river, we may\r\nthen add to the list the grand Tocantíns.[153] This splendid river has\r\nits source in the rich province of Minas (the source, also, of the San\r\nFrancisco and Uruguay), not six hundred miles from Rio Janeiro--a region\r\npossessing the finest climate in Brazil, and yielding diamonds and\r\nrubies, the sapphire, topaz and opal, gold, silver, and petroleum. The\r\nTocantíns is sixteen hundred miles long, and ten miles broad at its\r\nmouth; but, unfortunately, rapids commence one hundred and twenty miles\r\nabove Cametá. The Araguaia, its main branch, is, according to Castelnau,\r\none mile wide, with a current of three fourths of a mile an hour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: We are inclined to hold, with Bates and others, that the\r\nPará River is not, strictly speaking, one of the mouths of the Amazon.\r\n\"It is made to appear so on many of the maps in common use, because the\r\nchannels which connect it with the main river are there given much\r\nbroader than they are in reality, conveying the impression that a large\r\nbody of water finds an outlet from the main river into the Pará. It is\r\ndoubtful, however, if there be any considerable stream of water flowing\r\nconstantly downward through these channels. There is a great contrast in\r\ngeneral appearance between the Pará and the main Amazon. In the former\r\nthe flow of the tide always creates a strong current upward, while in\r\nthe Amazon the turbid flow of the mighty stream overpowers all tides,\r\nand produces a constant downward current. The color of the water is\r\ndifferent; that of the Pará being of a dingy orange-brown, while the\r\nAmazon has an ochreous or yellowish-clay tint. The forests on their\r\nbanks have a different aspect. On the Pará, the infinitely diversified\r\ntrees seem to rise directly out of the water, the forest-frontage is\r\ncovered with greenery, and wears a placid aspect; while the shores of\r\nthe main Amazon are encumbered with fallen trunks, and are fringed with\r\na belt of broad-leaved grasses.\"--_Naturalist on the Amazon_, i., p.\r\n3-5.]\r\n\r\nHere are six tributaries, all of them superior to any river in Europe,\r\noutside of Russia, save the Danube, and ten times greater than any\r\nstream on the west slope of the Andes. While the Arkansas joins the\r\nMississippi four hundred miles above New Orleans, the Madeira, of equal\r\nlength, enters the Amazon nine hundred miles from Pará. But, vast as are\r\nthese tributary streams, they seem to make no impression on the Amazon;\r\nthey are lost like brooks in the ocean. Our ideas of the magnitude of\r\nthe great river are wonderfully increased when we see the Madeira coming\r\ndown two thousand miles, yet its enormous contribution imperceptible\r\nhalf way across the giant river; or the dark waters of the Negro\r\ncreeping along the shore, and becoming undistinguishable five miles from\r\nits mouth. Though the Amazon carries a larger amount of sediment than\r\nany other river, it has no true delta, the archipelago in its mouth\r\n(for, like our own St. Lawrence, it has its Bay of a Thousand Isles) not\r\nbeing an alluvial formation, but having a rocky base. The great island\r\nof Marajó, in physical configuration, resembles the mainland of Guiana.\r\nThe deltoid outlet is confined to the tributaries, nearly all of them,\r\nlike \"the disembogning Nile,\" emptying themselves by innumerable\r\nembouchures. To several tributaries the Amazon gives water before it\r\nreceives their tribute. Thus, by ascending the Negro sixty miles, we\r\nhave the singular spectacle of water pouring in from the Amazon through\r\nthe Guariba Channel.\r\n\r\nThe waters of this great river system are of divers tints. The Amazon,\r\nas it leaps from the Andes, and as far down as the Ucayali, is blue,\r\npassing into a clear olive-green; likewise the Pastassa, Huallaga,\r\nTapajos, Xingú, and Tocantíns. Below the Ucayali it is of a pale,\r\nyellowish olive; the Madeira,[154] Purus, Juruá, Jutahí, Javarí,\r\nUcayali, Napo, Iça, and Japurá are of similar color. The Negro, Coary,\r\nand Teffé are black. Humboldt observes that \"a cooler atmosphere, fewer\r\nmusquitoes, greater salubrity, and absence of crocodiles, as also of\r\nfish, mark the region of these black rivers.\" This is not altogether\r\ntrue. The Amazon throughout is healthy, being swept by the trade-winds.\r\nThe branches, which are not so constantly refreshed by the ocean\r\nbreezes, are occasionally malarious; the \"white-water\" tributaries,\r\nexcept when they have a slack current in the dry season, have the best\r\nreputation, while intermittent fevers are nearly confined to the\r\ndark-colored streams. Much of the sickness on these tropical waters,\r\nhowever, is due to exposure and want of proper food rather than to the\r\nclimate. The river system of South America will favorably compare, in\r\npoint of salubrity, with the river system of its continental\r\nneighbor.[155]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: The Madeira has often a milky color which it receives\r\nfrom the white clay along its banks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: The average temperature of the water in the Lower Amazon\r\nis 81°, that of the air being a little less. The temperature of the\r\nHuallaga at Yurimaguas was 75° when the air was 88° in the shade; in\r\nanother experiment both the river and air were 80°. The Marañon at\r\nIquitos was 79° when the air was 90°. At the mouth of the Juruá, Herndon\r\nfound both water and air 82°. In the tropics the difference between the\r\ntemperature of the water and air is proportionally less than in high\r\nlatitudes.]\r\n\r\nAs we might expect, the volume of the Amazon is beyond all parallel.\r\nHalf a million cubic feet of water pour through the narrows of Obidos\r\nevery second, and fresh water may be taken up from the Atlantic far out\r\nof sight of land. The fall of the main easterly trunk of the Amazon is\r\nabout six and a half inches per mile, equivalent to a slope of 21'--the\r\nsame as that of the Nile, and one third that of the Mississippi. Below\r\nJaen there are thirty cataracts and rapids; at the Pongo de Manseriche,\r\nat the altitude of 1164 feet (according to Humboldt), it bids adieu to\r\nmountain scenery. Between Tabatinga and the ocean the average current is\r\nthree miles an hour. It diminishes toward Pará, and is every where at a\r\nminimum in the dry season; but it always has the \"swing\" of an ocean\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nThough not so rapid as the Mississippi, the Amazon is deeper. There are\r\nseven fathoms of water at Nauta (2200 miles from the Atlantic), eleven\r\nat Tabatinga, and twenty-seven on the average below Mandáos.[156]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: The assertion of the _Ency. Metropolitana_, that \"its\r\ncurrent has great violence and rapidity, and its depth is unfathomable,\"\r\nmust be received with some allowance.]\r\n\r\nThe Amazon and its branches are subject to an annual rise of great\r\nregularity. It does not take place simultaneously over the whole river,\r\nbut there is a succession of freshets. At the foot of the Andes the rise\r\ncommences in January; at Ega it begins about the end of February.\r\nCoinciding with this contribution from the west, the October rains on\r\nthe highlands of Bolivia and Brazil swell the southern tributaries,\r\nwhose accumulated floods reach the main stream in February; and the\r\nlatter, unable to discharge the avalanche of waters, inundates a vast\r\narea, and even crowds up the northern tributaries. As the Madeira,\r\nTapajos, and Purus subside, the Negro, fed by the spring rains in Guiana\r\nand Venezuela, presses downward till the central stream rolls back the\r\nnow sluggish affluents from the south. There is, therefore, a rhythmical\r\ncorrespondence in the rise and fall of the arms of the Amazon, so that\r\nthis great fresh-water sea sways alternately north and south; while the\r\nonward swell in the grand trunk is a progressive undulation eastward. As\r\nthe Cambridge Professor well says: \"In this oceanic river the tidal\r\naction has an annual instead of a daily ebb and flow; it obeys a larger\r\norb, and is ruled by the sun and not the moon.\" As the southern\r\naffluents have the greatest volume, the Amazon receives its largest\r\naccession after the sun has been in the southern hemisphere. The rise is\r\ngradual, increasing to one foot per day. One lowland after another sinks\r\nbeneath the flood; the forest stands up to its middle in the water, and\r\nshady dells are transformed into navigable creeks.[157] Swarms of\r\nturtles leave the river for the inland lakes; flocks of wading birds\r\nmigrate to the banks of the Negro and Orinoco to enjoy the cloudless sky\r\nof the dry season; alligators swim where a short time before the jaguar\r\nlay in wait for the tapir; and the natives, unable to fish, huddle in\r\ntheir villages to spend the \"winter of their discontent.\" The Lower\r\nAmazon is at its minimum in September or October. The rise above this\r\nlowest level is between seven and eight fathoms. If we consider the\r\naverage width of the Amazon two miles, we shall have a surface of at\r\nleast five thousand square miles raised fifty feet by the inundation. An\r\nextraordinary freshet is expected every sixth year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: The flooded lands are called _gapos_.]\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic tide is perceptible at Obidos, four hundred and fifty miles\r\nabove Pará, and Bates observed it up the Tapajos, five hundred and\r\nthirty miles distant. The tide, however, does not flow up; there is only\r\na rising and falling of the waters--the momentary check of the great\r\nriver in its conflict with the ocean. The \"bore,\" or _piroróco_, is a\r\ncolossal wave at spring tide, rising suddenly along the whole width of\r\nthe Amazon to a height of twelve or fifteen feet, and then collapsing\r\nwith a frightful roar.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon presents an unparalleled extent of water communication. So\r\nmany and far reaching are its tributaries, it touches every country on\r\nthe continent except Chile and Patagonia. South America is well nigh\r\nquartered by its river system: the Amazon starts within sixty miles of\r\nthe Pacific; the Tapajos and Madeira reach down to the La Plata; while\r\nthe Negro mingles its waters with those of the Orinoco. The tributaries\r\nalso communicate with each other by intersecting canals, so numerous\r\nthat central Amazonia is truly a cluster of islands. Wagons and\r\nrailroads will be out of the question for ages hence in this aquatic\r\nbasin. No other river runs in so deep a channel to so great a distance.\r\nFor two thousand miles from its month there are not less than seven\r\nfathoms of water. Not a fall interrupts navigation on the main stream\r\nfor two thousand five hundred miles; and it so happens that while the\r\ncurrent is ever east (for even the ocean can not send up its tide\r\nagainst it), there is a constant trade-wind westward, so that navigation\r\nup or down has always something in its favor. As a general rule, the\r\nbreeze is not so strong during the rise of the river. There are at least\r\nsix thousand miles of navigation for large vessels. It was lately said\r\nthat the Mississippi carries more vessels in a month, and the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang in a day, than the Amazon all the year round. But this is\r\nno longer true. Steamers already ascend regularly to the port of\r\nMoyabamba, which is less than twenty days' travel from the Pacific\r\ncoast. The Amazon was opened to the world September 7, 1867; and the\r\ntime can not be far distant when the exhaustless wealth of the great\r\nvalley--its timber, fruit, medicinal plants, gums, and dye-stuffs--will\r\nbe emptied by this great highway into the commercial lap of the\r\nAtlantic; when crowded steamers will plow all these waters--yellow,\r\nblack, and blue--and the sloths and alligators, monkeys and jaguars,\r\ntoucans and turtles, will have a bad time of it.\r\n\r\nOfficially free to the world, the great river is, however, for the\r\npresent practically closed to foreign shipping, as it is difficult to\r\ncompete with the Brazilian steamers. For, by the contract which lasts\r\ntill 1877, the company is allowed an annual subsidy of $4,000,000, which\r\nhas since been increased by 250 milreys per voyage. In 1867 the steamers\r\nand sailing vessels on the Amazon were divided as follows, though it\r\nmust be remembered that few of the foreign ships, excepting Portuguese,\r\nascended beyond Pará:\r\n\r\nNationality.     No.    Tonnage\r\nUnited States    37     39,901-1/2\r\nBrazil           49     28,639\r\nEngland          52     13,276-1/2\r\nPortugal         24      7,871\r\nFrance           18      5,344\r\nPrussia           4        889-1/2\r\nHolland           3        538\r\nDenmark           2        525\r\nHolstein          3        498\r\nNorway            1        135\r\nSpain             1         90\r\n\r\nThe vessels carrying the stars and stripes exported from Pará to the\r\nvalue of 3,235,073$950, or eight times the amount carried by Brazilian\r\ncraft, and 50,000 milreys more than England. While, therefore, the\r\nImperial Company has the monopoly of trade on the Amazon, our ships\r\ndistribute one third of the products to the world. The United States is\r\nthe natural commercial partner with Brazil; for not only is New York the\r\nhalf-way house between Pará and Liverpool, but a chip thrown into the\r\nsea at the mouth of the Amazon will float close by Cape Hatteras. The\r\nofficial value of exports from Pará in 1867 was 9,926,912$557, or about\r\nfive millions of dollars, an increase of one million over 1866.\r\n\r\nThe early expeditions into the Valley of the Amazon, in search of the\r\n\"Gilded King,\" are the most romantic episodes in the history of Spanish\r\ndiscovery. To the wild wanderings of these worshipers of gold succeeded\r\nthe more earnest explorations of the Jesuits, those pioneers of\r\ngeographical knowledge. Pinzon discovered the mouth of the river in\r\n1500; but Orellana, who came down the Napo in 1541, was the first to\r\nnavigate its waters. Twenty years later Aguirre descended from Cuzco; in\r\n1637, Texeira ascended to Quito by the Napo; Cabrera descended from Peru\r\nin 1639; Juan de Palacios by the Napo in 1725; La Condamine from Jaen in\r\n1744, and Madame Godin by the Pastassa in 1769. The principal travelers\r\nwho preceded us in crossing the continent this century were Mawe (1828),\r\nPoeppig (1831), Smyth (1834), Von Tschudi (1845), Castelnau (1846),\r\nHerndon and Gibbon (1851), and Marcoy (1867), who came down through\r\nPeru, and a Spanish commission (Almagro, Spada, Martinez, and Isern),\r\nwho made the Napo transit in 1865. To Spix and Martius (1820), Bates and\r\nWallace (1848-1857), Azevedo and Pinto (1862-1864), and Agassiz (1865),\r\nthe world is indebted for the most scientific surveys of the river in\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nSuch is the Amazon, the mightiest river in the world, rising amid the\r\nloftiest volcanoes on the globe, and flowing through a forest\r\nunparalleled in extent. \"It only wants (wrote Father Acuña), in order to\r\nsurpass the Ganges, Euphrates, and the Nile in felicity, that its source\r\nshould be in Paradise.\" As if one name were not sufficient for its\r\ngrandeur, it has three appellations: Marañon, Solimoens, and Amazon; the\r\nfirst applied to the part in Peru, the second to the portion between\r\nTabatinga and Manáos, and the third to all below the Rio Negro.[158] We\r\nhave no proper conception of the vast dimensions of the thousand-armed\r\nriver till we sail for weeks over its broad bosom, beholding it\r\nsweeping disdainfully by the great Madeira as if its contribution was of\r\nno account, discharging into the sea one hundred thousand cubic feet of\r\nwater per second more than our Mississippi, rolling its turbid waves\r\nthousands of miles exactly as it pleases,--plowing a new channel every\r\nyear, with tributaries twenty miles wide, and an island in its mouth\r\ntwice the size of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: The upper part of the Marañon, from its source to Jaen,\r\nis sometimes called the Tunguragua. Solimoens is now seldom heard; but,\r\ninstead, Middle Amazon, or simply Amazon. The term Alto Amazonas or High\r\nAmazon is also applied to all above the Negro. Marañon, says Velasco,\r\nderives its name from the circumstance that a soldier, sent by Pizarro\r\nto discover the sources of the Rio Piura, having beheld the mighty\r\nstream from the neighborhood of Jaen, and, astonished to behold a sea of\r\nfresh water, exclaimed, _\"Hac mare an non?\"_ Orellana's pretended fight\r\nwith a nation of female warriors gave rise to the Portuguese name of the\r\nriver, Amazonas (anglicized Amazon), after the mythical women in\r\nCappadocia, who are said to have burnt off their right breasts that they\r\nmight use the bow and javelin with more skill and force, and hence their\r\nname, [Greek: Amazones] from [Greek: a] and [Greek: mazos]. Orellana's\r\nstory probably grew out of the fact that the men wear long tunics, part\r\nthe hair in the middle, and, in certain tribes, alone wear ornaments.\r\nSome derive the name from the Indian word _amassona_, boat-destroyer.\r\nThe old name, Orellana, after the discoverer, is obsolete, as also the\r\nIndian term Parana-tinga, or King of Waters. In ordinary conversation it\r\nis designated as _the_ river, in distinction from its tributaries. \"In\r\nall parts of the world (says Hamboldt), the largest rivers are called by\r\nthose who dwell on their banks, _The River_, without any distinct and\r\npeculiar appellation.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n     The Valley of the Amazon.--Its Physical\r\n     Geography.--Geology.--Climate.--Vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Atlantic shore to the foot of the Andes, and from the Orinoco\r\nto the Paraguay, stretches the great Valley of the Amazon. In this vast\r\narea the United States might be packed without touching its boundaries.\r\nIt could contain the basins of the Mississippi, the Danube, the Nile,\r\nand the Hoang-Ho. It is girt on three sides by a wall of mountains: on\r\nthe north are the highlands of Guiana and Venezuela; on the west stand\r\nthe Andes; on the south rise the table-lands of Matto Grosso. The valley\r\nbegins at such an altitude, that on the western edge vegetation differs\r\nas much from the vegetation at Pará, though in the same latitude, as the\r\nflora of Canada from the flora of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the region drained by the Amazon, however, is not a\r\nvalley proper, but an extensive plain. From the mouth of the Napo to the\r\nocean, a distance of eighteen hundred miles in a straight line, the\r\nslope is one foot in five miles.[159] At Coca, on the Napo, the altitude\r\nis 850 feet, according to our observations; at Tinga Maria. on the\r\nHuallaga, it is 2200 according to Herndon; at the junction of the Negro\r\nwith the Cassiquiari, it is 400 according to Wallace; at the mouth of\r\nthe Marmoré, it is 800 according to Gibbon; at the Pongo de Manseriche,\r\nbelow all rapids, it is 1160 according to Humboldt; and at the junction\r\nof Araguaia with the Tocantíns, it is 200 according to Castelnau. These\r\nbarometrical measurements represent the basin of the Amazon as a shallow\r\ntrough lying parallel to the equator, the southern side having double\r\nthe inclination of the northern, and the whole gently sloping eastward.\r\nFarthermore, the channel of the great river is not in the centre of the\r\nbasin, but lies to the north of it: thus, the hills of Almeyrim rise\r\ndirectly from the river, while the first falls on the Tocantíns, Xingú,\r\nand Tapajos are nearly two hundred miles above their mouths; the rapids\r\nof San Gabriel, on the Negro, are one hundred and seventy-five miles\r\nfrom the Amazon, while the first obstruction to the navigation of the\r\nMadeira is a hundred miles farther from the great river.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: Professor Agassiz gives the average slope as hardly more\r\nthan a foot in ten miles, which is based on the farther assertion that\r\nthe distance from Tabatinga to the sea-shore is more than 2000 miles in\r\na straight line. The distance is not 1600, or exactly 1500, from\r\nPará.--See _A Journey in Brazil_, p. 349.]\r\n\r\nOf the creation of this valley we have already spoken. No region on the\r\nface of the globe of equal extent has such a monotonous geology. Around\r\nthe rim of the basin are the outcroppings of a cretaceous deposit; this\r\nrests on the hidden mezozoic and palæozoic strata which form the ribs of\r\nthe Andes. Above it, covering the whole basin from New Granada to the\r\nArgentine Republic,[160] are the following formations: first, a\r\nstratified accumulation of sand; second, a series of laminated clays, of\r\ndivers colors, without a pebble; third, a fine, compact sandstone;\r\nfourth, a coarse, porous sandstone, so ferruginous as to resemble bog\r\niron-ore. This last was, originally, a thousand feet in thickness, but\r\nwas worn down, _perhaps_, in some sudden escape of the pent-up waters\r\nof the valley. The table-topped hills of Almeyrim are almost the sole\r\nrelics.[161] Finally, over the undulating surface of the denuded\r\nsandstone an ochraceous, unstratified sandy clay was deposited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: Messrs. Myers and Forbes found this red clay on the\r\nNegro, most abundantly near Barcellos; also in small quantities on the\r\nOrinoco above Maipures. The officers of the \"Morona\" assured us that the\r\nsame formation was traceable far up the Ucayali and Huallaga. This clay\r\nfrom the Amazon, as examined microscopically by Prof. H. James Clark,\r\ncontains fragments of gasteropod shells and bivalve casts. The red earth\r\nof the Pampas, according to Ehrenberg, contains eight fresh-water to one\r\nsalt-water animalcule.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: \"On the South American coast, where tertiary and\r\nsupra-tertiary beds have been extensively elevated, I repeatedly noticed\r\nthat the uppermost beds were formed of coarser materials than the lower;\r\nthis appears to indicate that, as the sea becomes shallower, the force\r\nof the waves or currents increased.\"--Darwin's _Observations_, pt. ii.,\r\n131. \"Nowhere in the Pampas is there any appearance of much superficial\r\ndenudation.\"--Pt. iii., 100.]\r\n\r\nIt is a question to what period this great accumulation is to be\r\nassigned. Humboldt called it \"Old Red Sandstone;\" Martius pronounced it\r\n\"New Red;\" Agassiz says \"Drift\"--the glacial deposit brought down from\r\nthe Andes and worked over by the melting of the ice which transported\r\nit.[162] The Professor farther declares that \"these deposits are\r\nfresh-water deposits; they show no sign of a marine origin; no\r\nsea-shells nor remains of any marine animal have as yet been found\r\nthroughout their whole extent; tertiary deposits have never been\r\nobserved in any part of the Amazonian basin.\" This was true up to 1867.\r\nNeither Bates, Wallace, nor Agassiz found any marine fossil on the banks\r\nof the great river. But there is danger in building a theory on negative\r\nevidence. These explorers ascended no farther than Tabatinga. Two\r\nhundred miles west of that fort is the little Peruvian village of Pebas,\r\nat the confluence of the Ambiyacu. We came down the Napo and Marañon,\r\nand stopped at this place. Here we discovered a fossiliferous bed\r\nintercalated between the variegated clays so peculiar to the Amazon. _It\r\nwas crowded with marine tertiary shells!_ This was Pebas _vs_.\r\nCambridge. It was unmistakable proof that the formation was not drift,\r\nbut tertiary; not of fresh, but salt water origin. The species, as\r\ndetermined by W.M. Gabb, Esq., of Philadelphia, are: _Neritina pupa,\r\nTurbonilla minuscula_, _Mesalia Ortoni_, _Tellina Amazonenis_, _Pachydon\r\nobliqua_, and _P. tenua_.[163] All of these are new forms excepting the\r\nfirst, and the last is a new genus. It is a singular fact that the\r\n_Neritina_ is now living in the West India waters, and the species found\r\nat Pebas retains its peculiar markings. So that we have some ground for\r\nthe supposition that not many years ago there was a connection between\r\nthe Caribbean Sea and the Upper Amazon; in other words, that Guiana has\r\nonly very lately ceased to be an island. There is no mountain range on\r\nthe water-shed between the Orinoco and the Negro and Japurá, but the\r\nthree rivers are linked by natural canals.[164] Interstratified with the\r\nclay deposit are seams of a highly bituminous lignite; we traced it from\r\nnear the mouth of the Curaray on the Rio Napo to Loreto on the Marañon,\r\na distance of about four hundred miles. It occurs also at Iquitos. This\r\nis farther testimony against the glacial theory of the formation of the\r\nAmazonian Valley. The paucity of shells in such a vast deposit is not\r\nastonishing. It is as remarkable in the similar accumulation of reddish\r\nargillaceous earth, called \"Pampean mud,\" which overspreads the Rio\r\nPlata region.[165] Some of the Pampa shells, like those at Pebas, are\r\nproper to brackish water, and occur only on the highest banks. The\r\nPampean formation is believed by Mr. Darwin to be an estuary or delta\r\ndeposit. We will mention, in this connection, that silicified wood is\r\nfound at the head waters of the Napo; the Indians use it instead of\r\nflint (which does not occur there) in striking a light. Darwin found\r\nsilicified trees on the same slope of the Andes as the Uspallata Pass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: _A Journey in Brazil_, p. 250, 411, 424. Again, in his\r\nLecture before the Lowell Institute, 1866: \"These deposits could not\r\nhave been made by the sea, nor in a large lake, as they contain no\r\nmarine nor fresh-water fossils.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: These interesting fossils are figured and described in\r\nthe _Am. Journal of Conchology_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: \"The whole basin between the Orinoco and the Amazon is\r\ncomposed of granite and gneiss, slightly covered with débris. There is a\r\ntotal absence of sedimentary rocks. The surface is often bare and\r\ndestitute of soil, the undulations being only a few feet above or below\r\na straight line.\"--Evan Hopkins, in _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc_., vol. vi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: See Darwin on the absence of extensive modern\r\nconchiferous deposits in South America, _Geological Observations_, pt.\r\niii., ch. v.]\r\n\r\nThe climatology of the Valley of the Amazon is as simple as its physical\r\ngeography. There is no circle of the seasons as with us--nature moves in\r\na straight line. The daily order of the weather is uniform for months.\r\nThere is very little difference between the dry and hot seasons; the\r\nformer, lasting from July to December, is varied with showers, and the\r\nlatter, from January to June, with sunny days, while the daily\r\ntemperature is the same within two or three degrees throughout the year.\r\nOn the water-shed between the Orinoco and Negro it rains throughout the\r\nyear, but most water falls between May and November, the coolest season\r\nin that region. On the Middle Negro the wet season extends from June 1st\r\nto December 1st, and is the most sultry time.\r\n\r\nComparatively few insects, birds, or beasts are to be seen in summer;\r\nbut it is the harvest-time of the inhabitants, who spend the glorious\r\nweather rambling over the plaias and beaches, fishing and\r\nturtle-hunting. The middle of September is the midsummer of the valley.\r\nThe rainy season, or winter, is ushered in by violent thunder-storms\r\nfrom the west. It is then that the woods are eloquent with buzzing\r\ninsects, shrill cicadas, screaming parrots, chattering monkeys, and\r\nroaring jaguars. The greatest activity of animal and vegetable life is\r\nin June and July. The heaviest rains fall in April, May, and June.\r\nScarcely ever is there a continuous rain for twenty-four hours.\r\nCastelnau witnessed at Pebas a fall of not less than thirty inches in a\r\nsingle storm. The greatest amount noticed in New York during the whole\r\nmonth of September was 12.2 inches. The humidity of the atmosphere, as\r\nlikewise the luxuriance of vegetation and the abundance and beauty of\r\nanimal forms, increases from the Atlantic to the Andes. At the foot of\r\nthe Andes, Poeppig found that the most refined sugar in a few days\r\ndissolved into sirup, and the best gunpowder became liquid even when\r\ninclosed in canisters. So we found the Napo steaming with vapor. Fogs,\r\nhowever, are rarely seen on the Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe animals and plants are not all simultaneously affected by the change\r\nof seasons. The trees retain their verdure through the dry _vera[=o]_,\r\nand have no set time for renewing their foliage. There are a few trees,\r\nlike Mongruba, which drop their leaves at particular seasons; but they\r\nare so few in number they create the impression of a few dead leaves in\r\na thick-growing forest. Leaves are falling and flowers drooping all the\r\nyear round. Each species, and, in some cases, each individual, has its\r\nown particular autumn and spring. There is no hibernation nor æstivation\r\n(except by land shells); birds have not one uniform time for\r\nnidification; and moulting extends from February to May.\r\n\r\nAmazonia, though equatorially situated, has a temperate climate. It is\r\ncooler than Guinea or Guiana. This is owing to the constant evaporation\r\nfrom so much submerged land, and the ceaseless trade winds. The mean\r\nannual temperature of the air is about 81°.[166] The nights are always\r\ncool. There are no sudden changes, and no fiery \"dog days.\" Venereal and\r\ncutaneous affections are found among the people; but they spring from an\r\nirregular life. A traveler on the slow black tributaries may take the\r\ntertiana, but only after weeks of exposure. Yellow fever and cholera\r\nseldom ascend the river above Pará; and on the Middle Amazon there are\r\nneither endemics nor epidemics, though the trades are feebly felt\r\nthere, and the air is stagnant and sultry. According to Bates, swampy\r\nand weedy places on the Amazon are generally more healthy than dry ones.\r\nWhatever exceptions be taken to the branches, the main river is\r\ncertainly as healthy as the Mississippi: the rapid current of the water\r\nand the continual movement of the air maintaining its salubrity. The few\r\nEnglish residents (Messrs. Hislop, Jeffreys, and Hauxwell), who have\r\nlived here thirty or forty years, are as fresh and florid as if they had\r\nnever left their native country. The native women preserve their beauty\r\nuntil late in life. Great is the contrast between the gloomy winters and\r\ndusty summers, the chilly springs and frosty autumns of the temperate\r\nzone, and the perennial beauty of the equator! No traveler on the Amazon\r\nwould exchange what Wallace calls \"the magic half-hour after sunset\" for\r\nthe long gray twilight of the north. \"The man accustomed to this climate\r\n(wrote Herndon) is ever unwilling to give it up for a more bracing one.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: Agassiz calls the average temperature 84°, which, it\r\nseems to us, is too high. The mean between the temperatures of Pará,\r\nManáos, and Tabatinga is 80.7°.]\r\n\r\nThe mineral kingdom is represented only by sand, clay, and loam. The\r\nsolid rock (except the sandstone already mentioned) begins above the\r\nfalls on the tributaries. The precious gems and metals are confined to\r\nthe still higher lands of Goyaz, Matto Grosso, and the slopes of the\r\nAndes. The soil on the Lower Amazon is sandy; on the Solimoens and\r\nMarañon it is a stiff loam or vegetable mould, in many places twenty\r\nfeet deep.\r\n\r\nBoth in botany and zoology, South America is a natural and\r\nstrongly-marked division, quite as distinct from North America as from\r\nthe Old World; and as there are no transverse barriers, there is a\r\nremarkable unity in the character of the vegetation. No spot on the\r\nglobe contains so much vegetable matter as the Valley of the Amazon.\r\nFrom the grassy steppes of Venezuela to the treeless Pampas of Buenos\r\nAyres, expands a sea of verdure, in which we may draw a circle of eleven\r\nhundred miles in diameter, which shall include an ever green, unbroken\r\nforest. There is a most bewildering diversity of grand and beautiful\r\ntrees--a wild, unconquered race of vegetable giants, draped, festooned,\r\ncorded, matted, and ribboned with climbing and creeping plants, woody\r\nand succulent, in endless variety. The exuberance of nature displayed in\r\nthese million square acres of tangled, impenetrable forest offers a bar\r\nto civilization nearly as great as its sterility in the African deserts.\r\nA _macheta_ is a necessary predecessor: the moment you land (and it is\r\noften difficult to get a footing on the bank), you are confronted by a\r\nwall of vegetation. Lithe lianas, starred with flowers, coil up the\r\nstately trees, and then hang down like strung jewels; they can be\r\ncounted only by myriads, yet they are mere superfluities. The dense dome\r\nof green overhead is supported by crowded columns, often branchless for\r\neighty feet. The reckless competition among both small and great adds to\r\nthe solemnity and gloom of a tropical forest. Individual struggles with\r\nindividual, and species with species, to monopolize the air, light, and\r\nsoil. In the effort to spread their roots, some of the weaker sort,\r\nunable to find a footing, climb a powerful neighbor, and let their roots\r\ndangle in the air; while many a full-grown tree has been lifted up, as\r\nit were, in the strife, and now stands on the ends of its stilt-like\r\nroots, so that a man may walk upright between the roots and under the\r\ntrunk.[167]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: Buttress roots are not peculiar to any one species, but\r\ncommon to most of the large trees in the crowded forest, where the\r\nlateral growth of the roots is made difficult by the multitude of\r\nrivals. The Paxiuba, or big-bellied palm, is a fine example.]\r\n\r\nThe mass of the forest on the banks of the great river is composed of\r\npalms (about thirty species[168]), leguminous or pod-bearing trees,\r\ncolossal nut-trees, broad-leaved Musaceæ or bananas, and giant grasses.\r\nThe most prominent palms are the architectural Pupunha, or \"peach-palm,\"\r\nwith spiny stems, drooping, deep green leaves, and bunches of mealy,\r\nnutritious fruit; the slender Assaï, with a graceful head of delicate\r\ngreen plumes; the Ubussú, with mammoth, undivided fronds; the stiff,\r\nserrated-leaved Bussú, and gigantic Mirití. One of the noblest trees of\r\nthe forest is the Massaranduba, or \"cow-tree\" (_Brosimum\r\ngalactodendron_), often rising one hundred and fifty feet. It is a hard,\r\nfine-grained, durable timber, and has a red bark, and leathery, fig-like\r\nfoliage. The milk has the consistency of cream, and may be used for tea,\r\ncoffee, or custards. It hardens by exposure, so as to resemble\r\ngutta-percha. Another interesting tree, and one which yields the chief\r\narticle of export, is the Caucho, or India-rubber tree[169] (_Siphonia\r\nBrasiliensis_), growing in the lowlands of the Amazon for eighteen\r\nhundred miles above Pará. It has an erect, tall trunk, from forty to\r\neighty feet high, a smooth, gray bark, and thick, glossy leaves. The\r\nmilk resembles thick, yellow cream, and is colored by a dense smoke\r\nobtained by burning palm-nuts. It is gathered between August and\r\nDecember. A man can collect six pounds a day, though this is rarely\r\ndone. It is frequently adulterated with sand. The tree belongs to the\r\nsame apetalous family as our castor-oil and the mandioca; while the tree\r\nwhich furnishes the caoutchouc of the East Indies and Africa is a\r\nspecies of Ficus, and yields an inferior article to the rubber of\r\nAmerica. Other characteristic trees are the Mongruba, one of the few\r\nwhich shed their foliage before the new leaf-buds expand; the giant\r\nSamaüma, or silk-cotton tree (called _huimba_ in Peru); the Calabash, or\r\n_cuieira_, whose gourd-like fruit furnishes the cups used throughout the\r\nAmazon; the Itauba, or stone-wood, furnishing ship-timber as durable as\r\nteak; the red and white Cedar, used for canoes (not coniferous like the\r\nnorthern evergreen, but allied to the mahogany); the Jacarandá, or\r\nrose-wood, resembling our locust; Palo de sangre, one of the most\r\nvaluable woods on the river; Huacapú, a very common timber; Capirona,\r\nused as fuel on the steamers; and Tauarí, a heavy, close-grained wood,\r\nthe bark of which splits into thin leaves, much used in making\r\ncigarettes. The Piassaba, a palm yielding a fibre extensively\r\nmanufactured into cables and ropes, and exported to foreign countries\r\nfor brushes and brooms, being singularly elastic, strong, and more\r\ndurable than hemp; and the Moira-pinima, or \"tortoise-shell wood,\" the\r\nmost beautiful wood in all Amazonia, if not in the world, grow on the\r\nUpper Rio Negro. A small willow represents the great catkin family.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: Von Martius, in his great work on the Brazilian Palms,\r\nenumerates in all 582 species.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: The Portuguese and Brazilians call it _seringa_, or\r\nsyringe, in which form it is still used extensively, injections forming\r\na great feature in the popular system of cures. The tree mentioned above\r\nyields most of the rubber of commerce, and is considered distinct from\r\nthe species in Guiana, _S. elastica;_ while the rubber from the Upper\r\nAmazon and Rio Negro comes from the _S. lutea_ and _S. brevifolia_.\r\nAgassiz puts milk-weed in the same family!]\r\n\r\nThe valley is as remarkable for the abundance, variety, and value of its\r\ntimber as for any thing else. Within an area of half a mile square,\r\nAgassiz counted one hundred and seventeen different kinds of woods, many\r\nof them eminently fitted, by their hardness, tints, and beautiful grain,\r\nfor the finest cabinet-work. Enough palo de sangre or moira-pinima is\r\ndoubtless wasted annually to veneer all the palaces of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile most of our fruits belong to the rose family, those of the Amazon\r\ncome from the myrtle tribe. The delicious flavor, for which our fruits\r\nare indebted to centuries of cultivation, is wanting in many of the\r\ntorrid productions. We prefer the sweetness of Pomona in temperate\r\nclimes to her savage beauty in the sunny south. It is a curious fact,\r\nnoticed by Herndon, that nearly all the valuable fruits of the valley\r\nare inclosed in hard shells or acid pulps. They also reach a larger\r\nsize in advancing westward. The common Brazil nut is the product of one\r\nof the tallest trees in the forest (_Bertholletia excelsa_). The fruit\r\nis a hard, round shell, resembling a common ball, which contains from\r\ntwenty to twenty-four nuts. Eighteen months are required for the bud to\r\nreach maturity. This tree, says Humboldt, offers the most remarkable\r\nexample of high organic development. Akin to it is the Sapucaya or\r\n\"chickens' nuts\" (_Lecythis sapucaya_), whose capsule has a natural lid,\r\nand is called \"monkey's drinking-cup.\" The nuts, about a dozen in\r\nnumber, are of irregular shape and much richer than the preceding. But\r\nthey do not find their way to market, because they drop out of the\r\ncapsule as soon as ripe, and are devoured by peccaries and monkeys. The\r\nmost luscious fruit on the Amazon is the atta of Santarem. It has the\r\ncolor, taste, and size of the chirimoya; but the rind, which incloses a\r\nrich, custardly pulp, frosted with sugar, is scaled. Next in rank are\r\nthe melting pine-apples of Pará, and the golden papayas, fully equal to\r\nthose on the western coast. This is the original home of the cacao. It\r\ngrows abundantly in the forests of the upper river, and particularly on\r\nthe banks of the Madeira. The wild nut is smaller but more oily than the\r\ncultivated. The Amazon is destined to supply the world with the bulk of\r\nchocolate. The aromatic tonka beans (Cumarú) used in flavoring snuff,\r\nand the Brazilian nutmegs (Puxiri), inferior to the Ceylon, grow on\r\nlofty trees on the Negro and Lower Amazon. The Guaraná beans are the\r\nseeds of a trailing plant; from these the Mauhés prepare the great\r\nmedicine, on the Amazon, for diarrhoea and intermittent fevers. Its\r\nactive principle, caffeine, is more abundant than in any other\r\nsubstance, amounting to 5.07 per cent.; while black tea contains only\r\n2.13. Coffee, rice, tobacco, and sugar-cane are grown to a limited\r\nextent. Rio Negro coffee, if put into the market, would probably\r\neclipse that of Ceará, the best Brazilian. Wild rice grows abundantly on\r\nthe banks of the rivers and lakes. The cultivated grain is said to yield\r\nforty fold. Most of the tobacco comes down from the Marañon and Madeira.\r\nIt is put up in slender rolls from three to six feet long, tapering at\r\neach end, and wound with palm fibre. The sugar-cane is an exotic from\r\nSoutheastern Asia, but grows well. The first sugar made in the New World\r\nwas by the Dutch in the island of St. Thomas, 1610. Farina is the\r\nprincipal farinaceous production of Brazil. The mandioca or cassava\r\n(_Manihot utilissima_) from which it is made is supposed to be\r\nindigenous, though it is not found wild. It does not grow at a higher\r\naltitude than 2000 feet. Life and death are blended in the plant, yet\r\nevery part is useful. The cattle eat the leaves and stalks, while the\r\nroots are ground into pulp, which, when pressed and baked, forms farina,\r\nthe bread of all classes. The juice is a deadly poison: thirty-five\r\ndrops were sufficient to kill, in six minutes, a negro convicted of\r\nmurder; but it deposits a fine sediment of pure starch that is the\r\nwell-known tapioca; and the juice, when fermented and boiled, forms a\r\ndrink. On the upper waters grow the celebrated coca, a shrub with small,\r\nlight-green leaves, having a bitter, aromatic taste. The powdered\r\nleaves, mixed with lime, form _ypadú_. This is to Peruvians what opium\r\nis to the Turk, betel to the Malay, and tobacco to the Yankee. Thirty\r\nmillion pounds are annually consumed in South America. It is not,\r\nhowever, an opiate, but a powerful stimulant. With it the Indian will\r\nperform prodigies of labor, traveling days without fatigue or food. Von\r\nTschudi considers its moderate consumption wholesome, and instances the\r\nfact that one coca-chewer attained the good old age of one hundred and\r\nthirty years; but when used to excess it leads to idiocy. The signs of\r\nintemperance are an uncertain step, sallow complexion, black-rimmed,\r\ndeeply-sunken eyes, trembling lips, incoherent speech, and stolid\r\napathy. Coca played an important part in the religious rights of the\r\nIncas, and divine honors were paid to it. Even to-day the miners of Peru\r\nthrow a quid of coca against the hard veins of ore, affirming that it\r\nrenders them more easily worked; and the Indians sometimes put coca in\r\nthe mouth of the dead to insure them a welcome in the other world. The\r\nalkaloid cocaïne was discovered by Wöhler.\r\n\r\nFlowers are nearly confined to the edges of the dense forest, the banks\r\nof the rivers and lagunes. There are a greater number of species under\r\nthe equator, but we have brighter colors in the temperate zone. \"There\r\nis grandeur and sublimity in the tropical forest (wrote Wallace, after\r\nfour years of observation), but little of beauty or brilliancy of\r\ncolor.\" Perhaps the finest example of inflorescence in the world is seen\r\nin the _Victoria Regia_, the magnificent water-lily discovered by\r\nSchömberg in 1837. It inhabits the tranquil waters of the shallow lakes\r\nwhich border the Amazon. The leaves are from fifteen to eighteen feet in\r\ncircumference, and will bear up a child twelve years old; the upper part\r\nis dark, glossy green, the under side violet or crimson. The flowers are\r\na foot in diameter, at first pure white, passing, in twenty-four hours,\r\nthrough successive hues from rose to bright red. This queen of\r\nwater-plants was dedicated to the Queen whose empire is never at once\r\nshrouded in night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coca-plant.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n     Life within the Great\r\n     River.--Fishes.--Alligators.--Turtles.--Porpoises and Manatís.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amazon is a crowded aquarium, holding representatives of every\r\nzoological class--infusoria, hydras, fresh-water shells (chiefly\r\nAmpullaria, Melania, and Unios), aquatic beetles (belonging mostly to\r\nnew genera), fishes, reptiles, water birds, and cetaceans. The abundance\r\nand variety of fishes are extraordinary; so also are the species. This\r\ngreat river is a peculiar ichthyic province, and each part has its\r\ncharacteristics. According to Agassiz, the whole river, as well as its\r\ntributaries, is broken up into numerous distinct fauna.[170] The\r\n_pirarucú_, or \"redfish\" (the _Sudis gigas_ of science), is at once the\r\nlargest, most common, and most useful fish. The Peruvian Indians call it\r\n_payshi_. It is a powerful fish, often measuring eight feet in length\r\nand five in girth, clad in an ornamental coat-of-mail, its large scales\r\nbeing margined with bright red. It ranges from Peru to Pará. It is\r\nusually taken by the arrow or spear. Salted and dried, the meat will\r\nkeep for a year, and forms, with farina, the staple food on the Amazon.\r\nThe hard, rough tongue is used as a grater. Other fishes most frequently\r\nseen are the prettily-spotted catfish, Pescada, Piranha, Acará, which\r\ncarries its young in its mouth, and a long, slender needle-fish. There\r\nare ganoids in the river, but no sturgeons proper. Pickerel, perch, and\r\ntrout are also wanting. The sting-ray represents the shark family. As a\r\nwhole, the fishes of the Amazon have a marine character peculiarly their\r\nown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: We await the Professor's examination of his \"more than\r\n80,000 specimens\" before we give the number of new species.]\r\n\r\nThe reptilian inhabitants of this inland sea are introduced by numerous\r\nbatrachians, water-snakes (_Heliops_), and anacondas. But alligators\r\nbear the palm for ugliness, size, and strength. In summer the main river\r\nswarms with them; in the wet season they retreat to the interior lakes\r\nand flooded forests. It was for this reason that we did not see an\r\nalligator on the Napo. At low water they are found above the entrance of\r\nthe Curaray. About Obidos, where many of the pools dry up in the fine\r\nmonths, the alligator buries itself in the mud, and sleeps till the\r\nrainy season returns. \"It is scarcely exaggerating to say (writes Bates)\r\nthat the waters of the Solimoens are as well stocked with large\r\nalligators in the dry season as a ditch in England is in summer with\r\ntadpoles.\" There are three or four species in the Amazon. The largest,\r\nthe Jacaré-uassú of the natives, attains a length of twenty feet. The\r\nJacaré-tinga is a smaller kind (only five feet long when full grown),\r\nand has the long, slender muzzle of the extinct teleosaurus. The South\r\nAmerican alligators are smaller than the crocodiles of the Nile or\r\nGanges, and they are also inferior in rank. The head of the Jacaré-uassú\r\n(the ordinary species) is broad, while the gavial of India has a long,\r\nnarrow muzzle, and that of the Egyptian lizard is oblong. The dentition\r\ndiffers: while in the Old World saurian the teeth interlock, so that the\r\ntwo jaws are brought close together, the teeth in the upper jaw of the\r\nAmazonian cayman pass by the lower series outside of them. The latter\r\nhas therefore much less power. It has a ventral cuirass as well as\r\ndorsal, and it is web-footed, while the crocodile has the toes\r\nfree--another mark of inferiority. Sluggish on land, the alligator is\r\nvery agile in its element. It never attacks man when on his guard, but\r\nit is cunning enough to know when it may do this with safety. It lays\r\nits eggs (about twenty) some distance from the river bank, covering them\r\nwith leaves and sticks. They are larger than those of Guayaquil, or\r\nabout four inches long, of an elliptical shape, with a rough, calcareous\r\nshell. Negro venders sell them cooked in the streets of Pará.\r\n\r\nTurtles are, perhaps, the most important product of the Amazon, not\r\nexcepting the pirarucú. The largest and most abundant species is the\r\nTortaruga grande. It measures, when full grown, nearly three feet in\r\nlength and two in breadth, and has an oval, smooth, dark-colored shell.\r\nEvery house has a little pond (called _currúl_) in the back yard to hold\r\na stock of turtles through the wet season. It furnishes the best meat on\r\nthe Upper Amazon. We found it very tender, palatable, and wholesome; but\r\nBates, who was obliged to live on it for years, says it is very cloying.\r\nEvery part of the creature is turned to account. The entrails are made\r\ninto soup; sausages are made of the stomach; steaks are cut from the\r\nbreast; and the rest is roasted in the shell.[171] The turtle lays its\r\neggs (generally between midnight and dawn) on the central and highest\r\npart of the plaias, or about a hundred feet from the shore. The Indians\r\nsay it will lay only where itself was hatched out. With its hind\r\nflippers it digs a hole two or three feet deep, and deposits from eighty\r\nto one hundred and sixty eggs (Gibbon says from one hundred and fifty to\r\ntwo hundred). These are covered with sand, and the next comer makes\r\nanother deposit on the top, and so on until the pit is full. Egg-laying\r\ncomes earlier on the Amazon than on the Napo, taking place in August and\r\nSeptember. The tracajá, a smaller species, lays in July and August; its\r\neggs are smaller and oval, but richer than those of the great turtles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: The natives have this notion about the land-tortoise,\r\nthat by throwing it three times over the head, the liver (the best part)\r\nwill be enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe mammoth tortoise of the Galápagos lays an egg very similar in size\r\nand shape to that of the Tortaruga, but a month later, or in October.\r\nThe hunting of turtle eggs is a great business on the Amazon. They are\r\nused chiefly in manufacturing oil (mantéca) for illumination. Thrown\r\ninto a canoe, they are broken and beaten up by human feet; water is then\r\npoured in, and the floating oil is skimmed off, purified over the fire\r\nin copper kettles, and finally put up in three-gallon earthen jars for\r\nthe market. The turtles are caught for the table as they return to the\r\nriver after laying their eggs. To secure them, it suffices to turn them\r\nover on their backs. The turtles certainly have a hard time of it. The\r\nalligators and large fishes swallow the young ones by hundreds; jaguars\r\npounce upon the full-grown specimens as they crawl over the plaias, and\r\nvultures and ibises attend the feast. But man is their most formidable\r\nfoe. The destruction of turtle life is incredible. It is calculated that\r\nfifty millions of eggs are annually destroyed. Thousands of those that\r\nescape capture in the egg period are collected as soon as hatched and\r\ndevoured, \"the remains of yolk in their entrails being considered a\r\ngreat delicacy.\" An unknown number of full-grown turtles are eaten by\r\nthe natives on the banks of the Marañon and Solimoens and their\r\ntributaries, while every steamer, schooner, and little craft that\r\ndescends the Amazon is laden with turtles for the tables of Manáos,\r\nSantarem, and Pará. When we consider, also, that all the mature turtles\r\ntaken are females, we wonder that the race is not well-nigh extinct.\r\nThey are, in fact, rapidly decreasing in numbers. A large turtle which\r\ntwenty years ago could be bought for fifty cents, now commands three\r\ndollars. One would suppose that the males, being unmolested, would far\r\noutnumber the other sex, but Bates says \"they are immensely less\r\nnumerous than the females.\" The male turtles, or _Capitaris_, \"are\r\ndistinguishable by their much smaller size, more circular shape, and the\r\ngreater length and thickness of their tails.\" Near the Tapajos we met a\r\nthird species, called _Matá-matá_. It has a deeply-keeled carapax,\r\nbeautifully bossed, and a hideous triangular head, having curious,\r\nlobed, fleshy appendages, and nostrils prolonged into a tube. It is\r\nsupposed to have great virtues as a remedy for rheumatism. But the most\r\nnoticeable feature of the Amazonian fauna, as Agassiz has remarked, is\r\nthe abundance of cetaceans through its whole extent. From the brackish\r\nestuary of Pará to the clear, cool waters at the base of the Andes,\r\nthese clumsy refugees from the ocean may be seen gamboling and blowing\r\nas in their native element. Four different kinds of porpoises have been\r\nseen. A black species lives in the Bay of Marajó. In the Middle Amazon\r\nare two distinct porpoises, one flesh-colored;[172] and in the upper\r\ntributaries is the _Inia Boliviensis_, resembling, but specifically\r\ndifferent from the sea-dolphin and the soosoo of the Ganges. \"It was\r\nseveral years (says the Naturalist on the Amazon) before I could induce\r\na fisherman to harpoon dolphins (_Boutos_) for me as specimens, for no\r\none ever kills these animals voluntarily; the superstitious people\r\nbelieve that blindness would result from the use of the oil in lamps.\"\r\nThe herbivorous manati (already mentioned, Chap. XV.) is found\r\nthroughout the great river. It differs slightly from the Atlantic\r\nspecies. It rarely measures over twelve feet in length. It is taken by\r\nthe harpoon or nets of chambiri twine. Both Herndon and Gibbon mention\r\nseals as occurring in the Peruvian tributaries; but we saw none, neither\r\ndid Bates, Agassiz, or Edwards. They probably meant the manati.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: _Dephinus pallidus_. Bates observed this species at Villa\r\nNova; we saw it at Coary, 500 miles west; and Herndon found it in the\r\nHuallaga.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n     Life around the Great River.--Insects.--Reptiles.--Birds.--Mammals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forest of the Amazon is less full of life than the river. Beasts,\r\nbirds, and reptiles are exceedingly scarce; still there is, in fact, a\r\ngreat variety, but they are widely scattered and very shy. In the\r\nanimal, as in the vegetable kingdom, diversity is the law; there is a\r\ngreat paucity of individuals compared with the species.[173] Insects are\r\nrare in the dense forest; they are almost confined to the more open\r\ncountry along the banks of the rivers. Ants are perhaps the most\r\nnumerous. There is one species over an inch long. But the most\r\nprominent, by their immense numbers, are the dreaded saübas. Well-beaten\r\npaths branch off in every direction through the forest, on which broad\r\ncolumns may be seen marching to and fro, each bearing vertically a\r\ncircular piece of leaf. Unfortunately they prefer cultivated trees,\r\nespecially the coffee and orange. They are also given to plundering\r\nprovisions; in a single night they will carry off bushels of farina.\r\nThey are of a light red color, with powerful jaws. In every formicarium\r\nor ant colony there are three sets of individuals--males, females, and\r\nworkers; but the saübas have the singularity of possessing three classes\r\nof workers. The light-colored mounds often met in the forest, sometimes\r\nmeasuring forty feet in diameter by two feet in height, are the domes\r\nwhich overlie the entrances to the vast subterranean galleries of the\r\nsaüba ants. These ants are eaten by the Rio Negro Indians, and esteemed\r\na luxury; while the Tapajos tribes use them to season their mandioca\r\nsauce. Akin to the vegetable-feeding saübas are the carnivorous ecitons,\r\nor foraging ants, of which Bates found ten distinct species. They hunt\r\nfor prey in large organized armies, almost every species having its own\r\nspecial manner of marching and hunting. Fortunately the ecitons choose\r\nthe thickest part of the forest. The fire-ant is the great plague on the\r\nTapajos. It is small, and of a shiny reddish color; but its sting is\r\nvery painful, and it disputes every fragment of food with the\r\ninhabitants. All eatables and hammocks have to be hung by cords smeared\r\nwith copaiba balsam.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: Amazonia is divided into four distinct zoological\r\ndistricts: those of Ecuador, Peru, Guiana, and Brazil; the limits being\r\nthe Amazon, Madeira, and Negro. The species found on one side of these\r\nrivers are seldom found on the other.]\r\n\r\nThe traveler on the Amazon frequently meets with conical hillocks of\r\ncompact earth, from three to five feet high, from which radiate narrow\r\ncovered galleries or arcades. The architects of these wonderful\r\nstructures are the termites, or \"white ants,\" so called, though they\r\nbelong to a higher order of insects, widely differing from the true\r\nants. The only thing in common is the principle of division of labor.\r\nThe termite neuters are subdivided into two classes, soldiers and\r\nworkers, both wingless and blind. Their great enemy is the ant-eater;\r\nbut it is a singular fact, noticed by Bates, that the soldiers only\r\nattach themselves to the long worm-like tongue of this animal, so that\r\nthe workers, on whom the prosperity of the termitarum depends, are saved\r\nby the self-sacrifice of the fighting caste. The office of the termites\r\nin the tropics seems to be to hasten the decomposition of decaying\r\nvegetation. But they also work their way into houses, trunks, wardrobes,\r\nand libraries. \"It is principally owing to their destructiveness\" (wrote\r\nHumboldt) \"that it is so rare to find papers in tropical America older\r\nthan fifty or sixty years.\"\r\n\r\nDragon-flies are conspicuous specimens of insect life on the Amazon. The\r\nlargest and most brilliant kinds are found by the shady brooks and\r\ncreeks in the recesses of the forest, some of them with green or crimson\r\nbodies seven inches long, and their elegant lace-like wings tipped with\r\nwhite or yellow. Still more noticeable are the butterflies. There is a\r\nvast number of genera and species, and great beauty of dress, unequaled\r\nin the temperate zone. Some idea of the diversity is conveyed by the\r\nfact mentioned by Mr. Bates that about 700 species are found within an\r\nhour's walk of Pará, and 550 at Ega; while the total number found in the\r\nBritish Islands does not exceed 66, and the whole of Europe supports\r\nonly 300. After a shower in the dry season the butterflies appear in\r\nfluttering clouds (for they live in societies), white, yellow, red,\r\ngreen, purple, black, and blue, many of them bordered with metallic\r\nlines and spots of a silvery or golden lustre. The sulphur-yellow and\r\norange-colored kinds predominate. A colossal morpho, seven and a half\r\ninches in expanse, and visible a quarter of a mile off, frequents the\r\nshady glades; splendid swallow-tailed papilios, green, rose, or\r\nvelvety-black, are seen only in the thickets; while the _Hetaira\r\nesmeralda_, with transparent wings, having one spot of a violet hue, as\r\nit flies over the dead leaves in the dense forest looks \"like a\r\nwandering petal of a flower.\" Very abundant is the _Heliconius_, which\r\nplays such an important figure, by its variations, in Wallace's theory\r\nof the origin of species. On the Marañon we found _Callidryas eubule_, a\r\nyellow butterfly common in Florida. The most brilliant butterflies are\r\nfound on the Middle Amazon, out of reach of the strong trade winds. The\r\nmales far outnumber the other sex, are more richly colored, and\r\ngenerally lead a sunshiny life.\r\n\r\nThe females are of dull hues, and spend their lives in the gloomy\r\nshadows of the forest. Caterpillars and nocturnal moths are rare.\r\n\r\nThere are no true hive-bees (_Apides_) in South America,[174] but\r\ninstead there are about one hundred and fifty species of bees (mostly\r\nsocial _Moliponas_), smaller than the European, stingless, and\r\nconstructing oblong cells. Their colonies are much larger than those of\r\nthe honey-bee. The _Trigona_ occurs on the Napo. Unlike the _Melipona_,\r\nit is not confined to the New World. A large sooty-black Bombus\r\nrepresents our humble-bee. Shrill cicadas, blood-thirsty mantucas,\r\npiums, punkies, and musquitoes are always associated in the traveler's\r\nmemory with the glorious river. Of the last there are several kinds.\r\n\"The forest musquito belongs to a different species from that of the\r\ntown, being much larger and having transparent wings. It is a little\r\ncloud that one carries about his person every step on a woodland ramble,\r\nand their hum is so loud that it prevents one hearing well the notes of\r\nbirds. The town musquito has opaque, speckled wings, a less severe\r\nsting, and a silent way of going to work. The inhabitants ought to be\r\nthankful the big noisy fellows never come out of the forest\" (Bates,\r\nii., 386). There are few musquitoes below Ega; above that point a\r\nmusquito net is indispensable. Beetles abound, particularly in shady\r\nplaces, and are of all sizes, from that of a pin's head to several\r\ninches in length. The most noticeable are the gigantic _Megalosoma_ and\r\n_Enema_, armed with horns. Very few are carnivorous. \"This is the more\r\nremarkable,\" observes Darwin, \"when compared to the case of carnivorous\r\nquadrupeds, which are so abundant in hot countries.\" Very few are\r\nterrestrial, even the carnivorous species being found clinging to\r\nbranches and leaves. In going from the pole to the equator we find that\r\ninsect life increases in the same proportion as vegetable life. There is\r\nnot a single beetle on Melville Island; eleven species are found in\r\nGreenland; in England, 2500; in Brazil, 8000. Here lives the king of\r\nspiders, the _Mygale Blondii_, a monstrous hairy fellow, five inches\r\nlong, of a brown color, with yellowish lines along its stout legs. Its\r\nabode is a slanting subterranean gallery about two feet in length, the\r\nsides of which are beautifully lined with silk. Other spiders barricade\r\nthe walks in the forest with invisible threads; some build nests in the\r\ntrees and attack birds; others again spin a closely-woven web,\r\nresembling fine muslin, under the thatched roofs of the houses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: The honey-bee of Europe was introduced into South America\r\nin 1845.]\r\n\r\nOf land vertebrates, lizards are the first to attract the attention of\r\nthe traveler on the equator. Great in number and variety, they are met\r\nevery where--crawling up the walls of buildings, scampering over the\r\nhot, dusty roads, gliding through the forest. They stand up on their\r\nlegs, carry their tails cocked up in the air, and run with the activity\r\nof a warm-blooded animal. It is almost impossible to catch them. Some of\r\nthem are far from being the unpleasant-looking animals many people\r\nimagine; but in their coats of many colors, green, gray, brown, and\r\nyellow, they may be pronounced beautiful. Others, however, have a\r\nrepulsive aspect, and are a yard in length. The iguana, peculiar to the\r\nNew World tropics, is covered with minute green scales handed with brown\r\n(though it changes its color like the chameleon), and has a serrated\r\nback and gular pouch. It grows to the length of five feet, and is\r\narboreal. Its white flesh, and its oblong, oily eggs, arc considered\r\ngreat delicacies. We heard of a lady who kept one as a pet. Frogs and\r\ntoads, the chief musicians in the Amazonian forest, are of all sizes,\r\nfrom an inch to a foot in diameter. The _Bufo gigas_ is of a dull gray\r\ncolor, and is covered with warts. Tree-frogs (_Hyla_) are very\r\nabundant; they do not occur on the Andes or on the Pacific coast. Their\r\nquack-quack, drum-drum, hoo-hoo, is one of our pleasant memories of\r\nSouth America. Of snakes there is no lack; and yet they are not so\r\nnumerous as imagination would make them. There are one hundred and fifty\r\nspecies in South America, or one half as many, on the same area, as in\r\nthe East Indies. The diabolical family is led by the boa, while the rear\r\nis brought up by the Amphisbænas, or \"double-headed snakes,\" which\r\nprogress equally well with either end forward, so that it is difficult\r\nto make head or tail of them. The majority are harmless. The deadly\r\ncorál is found on both sides of the Andes, and wherever there is a cacao\r\nplantation. One of the most beautiful specimens of the venomous kind is\r\na new species (_Elaps imperator_, Cope), which we discovered on the\r\nMarañon. It has a slender body more than two feet in length, with black\r\nand red bands margined with yellow, and a black and yellow head, with\r\npermanently erect fangs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Iguana.]\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the most common birds. Probably, says Wallace,\r\nno country in the world contains a greater variety of birds than the\r\nAmazonian Valley. But the number does not equal the expectations of the\r\ntraveler; he may ramble a whole day without meeting one. The rarity,\r\nhowever, is more apparent than real; we forget, for the moment, the\r\nvastness of their dwelling-place. The birds of the country, moreover,\r\nare gregarious, so that a locality may be deserted and silent at one\r\ntime and swarming with them at another. Parrots and toucans are the most\r\ncharacteristic groups. To the former belong true parrots, parroquets,\r\nand macaws. The first are rarely seen walking, but are rapid flyers and\r\nexpert climbers. On the trees they are social as monkeys, but in flight\r\nthey always go in pairs. The parroquets go in flocks. The Hyacinthine\r\nmacaw (the Araruna of the natives) is one of the finest and rarest\r\nspecies of the parrot family. It is found only on the south side of the\r\nAmazon. The macaw was considered sacred by the Maya Indians of Yucatan,\r\nand dedicated to the sun. The Quichuans call it guacamayo, guaca meaning\r\nsacred. Of toucans there are many species; the largest is the toco, with\r\na beak shaped like a banana; the most beautiful are the curb-crested, or\r\nBeauharnais toucans, and the _P. flavirostris_, whose breast is adorned\r\nwith broad belts of red, crimson, and black. \"Wherefore such a beak?\"\r\nevery naturalist has asked; but the toucan still wags his head, as much\r\nas to say, \"you can not tell.\" There must be some other reason than\r\nadaptation. Birds of the same habits are found beside it--the ibis,\r\npigeon, spoonbill, and toucan are seen feeding together. \"How\r\nastonishing are the freaks and fancies of Nature! (wrote the funny\r\nSidney Smith). To what purpose, we say, is a bird placed in the woods of\r\nCayenne with a bill a yard long, making a noise like a puppy-dog, and\r\nlaying eggs in hollow trees? The toucan, to be sure, might retort, to\r\nwhat purpose are certain foolish, prating members of Parliament created,\r\npestering the House of Commons with their ignorance and folly, and\r\nimpeding the business of the country? There is no end to such questions;\r\nso we will not enter into the metaphysics of the toucan.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toucans.]\r\n\r\nOn the flooded islands of the Negro and Upper Amazon is found the rare\r\nand curious umbrella bird, black as a crow, and decorated with a crest\r\nof hairy plumes and a long lobe suspended from the neck, covered with\r\nglossy blue feathers. This latter appendage is connected with the vocal\r\norgans, and assists the bird in producing its deep, loud, and lengthy\r\nfluty note. There are three species. Another rare bird is the Uruponga,\r\nor Campanéro, in English the tolling-bell bird, found only on the\r\nborders of Guiana. It is of the size of our jay, of a pure white color,\r\nwith a black tubercle on the upper side of the bill. \"Orpheus himself\r\n(says Waterton) would drop his lute to listen to him, so sweet, so\r\nnovel, and romantic is the toll of the pretty, snow-white Campanéro.\"\r\n\"The Campanéro may be heard three miles! (echoes Sidney Smith). This\r\nsingle little bird being more powerful than the belfry of a cathedral\r\nringing for a new dean! It is impossible to contradict a gentleman who\r\nhas been in the forests of Cayenne, but we are determined, as soon as a\r\nCampanéro is brought to England, to make him toll in a public place, and\r\nhave the distance measured.\"[175] But the most remarkable songster of\r\nthe Amazonian forest is the Realejo, or organ-bird. Its notes are as\r\nmusical as the flageolet. It is the only songster, says Bates, which\r\nmakes any impression on the natives. Besides those are the Jacamars,\r\npeculiar to equatorial America, stupid, but of the most beautiful\r\ngolden, bronze, and steel colors; sulky Trogons, with glossy green backs\r\nand rose-colored breasts; long-toed Jaçanas, half wader, half fowl; the\r\nrich, velvety purple and black _Rhamphocoelus Jacapa_, having an immense\r\nrange from Archidona to Pará; the gallinaceous yet arboreal Ciganas;\r\nscarlet ibises, smaller, but more beautiful than their sacred cousins of\r\nthe Nile; stilted flamingoes, whose awkwardness is atoned for by their\r\nbrilliant red plumage; glossy black Mutums, or curassow turkeys; ghostly\r\nstorks, white egrets, ash-colored herons, black ducks, barbets,\r\nkingfishers, sandpipers, gulls, plovers, woodpeckers, oreoles; tanagers,\r\nessentially a South American family, and, excepting three or four\r\nspecies, found only east of the Andes; wagtails, finches, thrushes,\r\ndoves, and hummers. The last, \"by western Indians _living sunbeams_\r\nnamed,\" are few, and not to be compared with the swarms in the Andean\r\nvalleys. The birds of the Amazon have no uniform time for breeding. The\r\nmajority, however, build their nests between September and New Year's,\r\nand rarely lay more than two eggs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: Review of Waterton's _Wanderings in South America_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brazilian Hummers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Capybara]\r\n\r\nAmazonia, like Australia, is poor in terrestrial mammals, and the\r\nspecies are of small size. Nearly the only game a hunter can depend upon\r\nfor food, besides toucans and macaws, is peccari. One species of tapir,\r\nto represent the elephants and rhinoceroses of the Old World; three\r\nsmall species of deer, taking the places of deer, antelopes, buffaloes,\r\nsheep, and goats of the other continent; three species of large Felidæ;\r\none peccari, and a wild dog, with opossums, ant-eaters, armadilloes,\r\nsloths, squirrels (the only rodents which approach ours),[176]\r\ncapybaras, pacas, agoutis, and monkeys, comprise all the quadrupeds of\r\nequatorial America. The last two are the most numerous. Marsupial rats\r\ntake the place of the insectivorous mammals. Of ant-eaters, there are at\r\nleast four distinct species; but they are scattered sparingly, and are\r\nseldom found on the low flooded lands. Four or five species of\r\narmadillo inhabit the valley. These little nocturnal burrowing edentates\r\nare the puny representatives of the gigantic Glyptodon of Pleistocene\r\ntimes, and the sloths are the dwindling shadows of the lordly\r\nMegatherium. There are two species of three-toed sloths--one inhabiting\r\nthe swampy lowlands, the other confined to the terra-firma land. They\r\nlead a lonely life, never in groups, harmless and frugal as a hermit.\r\nThey have four stomachs, but not the long intestines of ruminating\r\nanimals. They feed chiefly on the leaves of the trumpet-tree\r\n(_Cecropia_), resembling our horse-chestnut. The natives, both Indian\r\nand Brazilian, hold the common opinion that the sloth is the type of\r\nlaziness. The capybara or ronsoco, the largest of living rodents, is\r\nquite common on the river side. It is gregarious and amphibious, and\r\nresembles a mammoth guinea-pig. Pacas and agoutis are most abundant in\r\nthe lowlands, and are nocturnal. These semi-hoofed rodents, like the\r\nToxodon of old, approach the Pachyderms. The tapir, or gran-bestia, as\r\nit is called, is a characteristic quadruped of South America. It is a\r\nclumsy-looking animal, with a tough hide of an iron-gray color, covered\r\nwith a coat of short coarse hair. Its flesh is dry, but very palatable.\r\nIt has a less powerful proboscis than the Malay species. M. Roulin\r\ndistinguishes another species from the mountains, which more nearly\r\nresembles the Asiatic. The tapir, like the condor, for an unknown\r\nreason, is not found north of 8° N., though it wanders as far south as\r\n40°. We met but one species of peccari, the white-lipped (_D.\r\nlabiatus_). It is much larger than the \"Mexican hog,\" and, too\r\nthick-headed to understand danger, is a formidable antagonist. The\r\nraposa is seen only on the Middle Amazon, and very rarely there. It has\r\na long tapering muzzle, small ears, bushy tail, and grayish hair. It\r\ntakes to the water, for the one we saw at Tabatinga was caught while\r\ncrossing the Amazon. Fawn-colored pumas, spotted jaguars, black tigers,\r\ntiger-cats--all members of the graceful feline family--inhabit all parts\r\nof the valley, but are seldom seen. The puma, or panther, is more common\r\non the Pacific side of the Andes. The jaguar[177] is the fiercest and\r\nmost powerful animal in South America. It is marked like the\r\nleopard--roses of black spots on a yellowish ground; but they are\r\nangular instead of rounded, and have a central dot. There are also\r\nseveral black streaks across the breast, which easily distinguish it\r\nfrom its transatlantic representative. It is also longer than the\r\nleopard; indeed, Humboldt says he saw a jaguar \"whose length surpassed\r\nthat of any of the tigers of India which he had seen in the collections\r\nof Europe.\" The jaguar frequents the borders of the rivers and lagunes,\r\nand its common prey is the capybara. It fears the peccari. The night air\r\nis alive with bats of many species, the most prominent one being the\r\n_Dysopes perotis_, which measures two feet from tip to tip of the wings.\r\nIf these Cheiropters are as impish as they look, and as blood-thirsty as\r\nsome travelers report, it is singular that Bates and Waterton, though\r\nresiding for years in the country, and ourselves, though sleeping for\r\nmonths unprotected, were unmolested.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: Large rats abound on the Marnañon, but they are not\r\nAmerican.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: The Tupi word for dog is _yaguara_, and for wolf,\r\n_yagua-men_, or old dog.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jaguar.]\r\n\r\nAbout forty species of monkeys, or one half of the New World forms,\r\ninhabit the Valley of the Amazon. Wallace, in a residence of four years,\r\nsaw twenty-one species--seven with prehensile and fourteen with\r\nnon-prehensile tails. They all differ from the apes of the other\r\nhemisphere. While those of Africa and Asia (Europe has only one) have\r\nopposable thumbs on the fore feet as well as hind, uniformly ten molar\r\nteeth in each jaw, as in man, and generally cheek-pouches and naked\r\ncollosities, the American monkeys arc destitute of the two latter\r\ncharacteristics. None of them are terrestrial, like the baboon; all\r\n(save the marmosets) have twenty-four molars; the thumbs of the\r\nfore-hands are not habitually opposed to the fingers (one genus, Ateles,\r\n\"the imperfect,\" is thumbless altogether); the nostrils open on the\r\nsides of the nose instead of beneath it, as in the gorilla, and the\r\nmajority have long prehensile tails. They are inferior in rank to the\r\nanthropoids of the Old World, though superior to the lemurs of\r\nMadagascar. They are usually grouped in two families--Marmosets and\r\nCebidre. The former are restless, timid, squirrel-like lilliputs (one\r\nspecies is only seven inches long), with tails not prehensile--in the\r\ncase of the scarlet-faced, nearly wanting. The Barigudos, or gluttons\r\n(_Lagothrix_), are the largest of American monkeys, but are not so tall\r\nas the Coaitas. They are found west of Manáos. They have more human\r\nfeatures than the other monkeys, and, with their woolly gray fur,\r\nresemble an old negro. There are three kinds of howlers (_Mycetes_)--the\r\nred or mono-colorado of Humboldt, the black, and the _M. beelzebub_,\r\nfound only near Pará. The forest is full of these surly, untamable\r\nguaribas, as the natives call them. They are gifted with a voice of\r\ntremendous power and volume, with which they make night and day hideous.\r\nThey represent the baboons of the Old World in disposition and facial\r\nangle (30°), and the gibbons in their yells and gregarious habits.[178]\r\nThe Sapajous (_Cebus_) are distributed throughout Brazil, and have the\r\nreputation of being the most mischievous monkeys in the country. On the\r\nwest coast of South America there are at least three or four species of\r\nmonkeys, among them a black howler and a _Cebus capucinus_. The Coitas,\r\nor spider-monkeys, are the highest of American quadrumana. They are\r\nslender-legged, sluggish, and thumbless, with a most perfectly\r\nprehensile tail, terminating in a naked palm, which answers for a fifth\r\nhand. The Indians say they walk under the limbs like the sloth. They are\r\nthe most common pets in Brazil, but they refuse to breed in captivity.\r\nBoth Coitas and Barigudos are much persecuted for their flesh, which is\r\nhighly esteemed by the Indians.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: Rütimeyer has found a fossil howler in the Swiss\r\nJura--middle cocene.]\r\n\r\nMr. Bates has called our attention to the arboreal character of a large\r\nshare of the animals in the Amazonian forest. All the monkeys and bats\r\nare climbers, and live in the trees. Nearly all the carnivores are\r\nfeline, and are therefore tree-mounters, though they lead a terrestrial\r\nlife. The plantigrade Cercoleptes has a long tail, and is entirely\r\narboreal. Of the edentates, the sloth can do nothing on the ground. The\r\ngallinaceous birds, as the cigana and curassow--the pheasant and turkey\r\nof the Amazon--perch on the trees, while the great number of arboreal\r\nfrogs and beetles is an additional proof of the adaptation of the fauna\r\nto a forest region. Even the epiphytous plants sitting on the branches\r\nsuggest this arboreal feature in animal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n     Life around the Great River.--Origin of the Red Man.--General\r\n     Characteristics of the Amazonian Indians.--Their Languages,\r\n     Costumes, and Habitations.--Principal Tribes.--Mixed\r\n     Breeds.--Brazilians and Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the genus Homo. Man makes a very insignificant figure in\r\nthe vast solitudes of the Amazon. Between Manáos and Pará, the most\r\ndensely-peopled part of the valley, there is only one man to every four\r\nsquare miles; and the native race takes a low place in the scale of\r\nhumanity. As the western continent is geologically more primitive than\r\nthe eastern, and as the brute creation is also inferior in rank, so the\r\nAmerican man, in point of progress, seems to stand in the rear of the\r\nOld World races. Both the geology and zoology of the continent were\r\narrested in their development. Vegetable life alone has been favored.\r\n\"The aboriginal American (wrote Von Martius) is at once in the\r\nincapacity of infancy and unpliancy of old age; he unites the opposite\r\npoles of intellectual life.\"[179]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: \"I think I discover in the Americans (said Humboldt) the\r\ndescendants of a rare which, early separated from the rest of mankind,\r\nhas followed up for a series of years a peculiar road in the unfolding\r\nof its intellectual faculties and its tendency toward civilization.\" The\r\nSouth American Indian seems to have a natural aptitude for the arts of\r\ncivilized life not found in the red men of our continent.]\r\n\r\nWe will not touch the debatable ground of the red man's origin, nor\r\ninquire whether he is the last remains of a people once high in\r\ncivilization. But we are tempted to express the full belief that\r\ntropical America is not his \"centre of creation.\" He is not the true\r\nchild of the tropics; and he lives as a stranger, far less fitted for\r\nits climate than the Negro or Caucasian. Yet a little while, and the\r\nrace will be as extinct as the Dodo. He has not the supple organization\r\nof the European, enabling him to accommodate himself to diverse\r\nconditions. Among the Andean tribes there are seldom over five children,\r\ngenerally but one, in a family; and Bates, speaking of Brazilian\r\nIndians, says \"their fecundity is of a low degree, and it is very rare\r\nto find a family having so many as four children.\"[180]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: We do not infer, however, from this fact alone, that the\r\nrace is exotic, for the Negroes of Central Africa multiply very slowly.]\r\n\r\nWhile it is probable that Mexico was peopled from the north, it is very\r\ncertain that the Tupi and Guarani, the long-headed hordes that occupied\r\neastern South America, came up from the south, moving from the Paraguay\r\nto the banks of the Orinoco. From the Tupi nation (perhaps a branch of\r\nthe Guarani) sprung the multitudinous tribes now dwelling in the vast\r\nvalley of the Amazon. In such a country--unbroken by a mountain, uniform\r\nin climate--we need not look for great diversity. The general characters\r\nare these: skin of a brown color, with yellowish tinge, often nearly the\r\ntint of mahogany; thick, straight, black hair; black, horizontal eyes;\r\nlow forehead, somewhat compensated by its breadth; beardless; of the\r\nmiddle height, but thick-set; broad, muscular chest; small hands and\r\nfeet; incurious; unambitious; impassive; undemonstrative; with a dull\r\nimagination and little superstition; with no definite idea of a Supreme\r\nBeing, few tribes having a name for God, though one for the \"Demon;\"\r\nwith no belief in a future state; and, excepting civility, with virtues\r\nall negative. The semi-civilized along the Lower Amazon, called\r\n_Tupuyos_, seem to have lost (in the language of Wallace) the good\r\nqualities of savage life, and gained only the vices of civilization.\r\n\r\nThere are several hundred different tribes in Amazonia, each having a\r\ndifferent language; even the scattered members of the same tribe can not\r\nunderstand each other.[181] This segregation of dialects is due in great\r\npart to the inflexibility of Indian character, and his isolated and\r\nnarrow round of thought and life. When and where the Babel existed,\r\nwhence the many branches of the great Tupi family separated, we know\r\nnot. We only know that though different in words, these languages have\r\nthe same grammatical construction. In more than one respect the polyglot\r\nAmerican is antipodal to the Chinese. The language of the former is\r\nrichest in words, that of the latter the poorest. The preposition\r\nfollows the noun, and the verb ends the sentence. Ancient Tupi is the\r\nbasis of the Lingoa Geral, the inter-tribal tongue on the Middle Amazon.\r\nThe semi-civilized Ticunas, Mundurucus, etc., have one costume--the men\r\nin trowsers and white cotton shirts, the women in calico petticoats,\r\nwith short, loose chemises, and their hair held in a knot on the top of\r\nthe head by a comb, usually of foreign make, but sometimes made of\r\nbamboo splinters. The wild tribes north and south go nearly or quite\r\nnude, while those on the western tributaries wear cotton or bark togas\r\nor ponchos. The habitations are generally a frame-work of poles,\r\nthatched with palm-leaves; the walls sometimes latticed and plastered\r\nwith mud, and the furniture chiefly hammocks and earthen vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Native Comb.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: Authors compute in South America from 280 to 700\r\nlanguages (Abbé Royo said 2000), of which four fifths are composed of\r\nidioms radically distinct.]\r\n\r\nThe Mundurucus are the most numerous and warlike tribe in Amazonia. They\r\ninhabit both banks of the Tapajos, and can muster, it is said, 2000\r\nfighting men. They are friendly to the whites, and industrious, selling\r\nto traders large quantities of farina, sarsaparilla, rubber, and tonka\r\nbeans. Their houses are conical or quadrangular huts, sometimes open\r\nsheds, and generally contain many families. According to Wallace, the\r\nMundurucus are the only perfectly tattooed nation in South America. It\r\ntakes at least ten years to complete the tattooing of the whole person.\r\nThe skin is pricked with spines, and then the soot from burning pitch\r\nrubbed in. Their neighbors, the Parárauátes, are intractable, wandering\r\nsavages, roaming through the forest and sleeping in hammocks slung to\r\nthe trees. They have delicately-formed hands and feet, an oval face, and\r\nglistening black eyes. On the west side of the Tapajos, near Villa Nova,\r\nare the Mauhés, an agricultural tribe, well formed, and of a mild\r\ndisposition. On the Lower Madeira are the houseless, formidable Aráras,\r\nwho paint their chins red with achote (anatto), and usually have a black\r\ntattooed streak on each side of the face. They have long made the\r\nnavigation of the great tributary hazardous. Above them dwell the\r\nParentintíns, light colored and finely featured, but nude and savage. In\r\nthe labyrinth of lakes and channels at the mouth of the Madeira live the\r\nlazy, brutal Múras, the most degraded tribe on the Amazon. They have a\r\ndarker skin than their neighbors, an extraordinary breadth of chest,\r\nmuscular arms, short legs, protuberant abdomens, a thin beard, and a\r\nbold, restless expression. They pierce the lips, and wear peccari tusks\r\nin them in time of war. The Indians on the Purus live generally on the\r\ncommunal principle, and are unwarlike and indolent. The Puru-purús bury\r\nin sandy beaches, go naked, and have one wife.\r\n\r\nOn the great northwest tributary of the Rio Negro, the Uacaiari, there\r\nare numerous tribes, collectively known as the Uaupés. They have\r\npermanent abodes, in shape a parallelogram, with a semicircle at one\r\nend, and of a size to contain several families, sometimes a whole tribe.\r\nOne of them, Wallace informs us, was 115 feet long by 75 broad, and\r\nabout 30 high. The walls are bullet-proof. Partitions of palm-leaves\r\ndivide it into apartments for families, the chief occupying the\r\nsemicircular end. The men alone wear clothes and ornaments, but both\r\nsexes paint their bodies with red, black, and yellow colors in regular\r\npatterns. The men have a little beard, which they pull out, as also the\r\neyebrows, and allow the hair to grow unshorn, tying it behind with a\r\ncord and wearing a comb; while the women cut theirs and wear no comb.\r\nThey are an agricultural people--peaceable, ingenious, apathetic,\r\ndiffident, and bashful.\r\n\r\nThe Catauishés inhabit the banks of the Teffé. They perforate the lips,\r\nand wear rows of sticks in the holes. At the mouth of the Juruá are the\r\nuncivilized, but tall, noble-looking Marauás. They pierce the ears and\r\nlips, and insert sticks. They live in separate families, and have no\r\ncommon chief. Above them live the treacherous Arauás.[182] On the\r\nopposite side of the Amazon are the nearly extinct Passés and Jurís, the\r\nfinest tribes in central South America. They are peaceable and\r\nindustrious, and have always been friendly to the whites. The Passés are\r\na slenderly-built, light-colored, dignified, superior race,\r\ndistinguished by a large square tattooed patch in the middle of the\r\nface. The Jurís tattoo in a circle round the mouth. Near by are the\r\nUænambeus, or \"Humming-birds,\" distinguished by a small blue mark on\r\nthe upper lip. Higher up the Japurá is the large cannibal tribe of\r\nMiránhas, living in isolated families; and on the Tocantíns dwell the\r\nlow Caishánas, who kill their first-born children. Along the left bank\r\nof the Amazon, from Loreto to Japurá, are the scattered houses and\r\nvillages of the Tucúnas. This is an extensive tribe, leading a settled\r\nagricultural life, each horde having a chief and a \"medicine-man,\" or\r\npriest of their superstitions. They are good-natured and ingenious,\r\nexcelling most of the other tribes in the manufacture of pottery; but\r\nthey are idle and debauched, naked except in the villages, and tattooed\r\nin numbers of short, straight lines on the face. The Marúbos, on the\r\nJavarí, have a dark complexion and a slight beard; and on the west side\r\nof the same river roam the Majerónas--fierce, hostile, light colored,\r\nbearded cannibals. In the vicinity of Pebas dwell the inoffensive\r\nYaguas. The shape of the head (but not their vacant expression) is well\r\nrepresented by Catlin's portrait of \"Black Hawk,\" a Sauk chief. They are\r\nquite free from the encumbrance of dress, the men wearing a girdle of\r\nfibrous bark around the loins, with bunches looking like a mop hanging\r\ndown in front and rear, and similar bunches hung around the neck and\r\narms. The women tie a strip of brown cotton cloth about the hips. They\r\npaint the whole body with achote.[183] They sometimes live in\r\ncommunities. One large structure, with Gothic roof, is used in common;\r\non the inside of which, around the walls, are built family\r\nsleeping-rooms. The Yaguas are given to drinking and dancing. They are\r\nsaid to bury their dead inside the house of the deceased, and then set\r\nfire to it; but this conflicts with their communal life. Perhaps, with\r\nthe other tribes on the Japurá, Iça, and Napo, they are fragments of\r\nthe great Omágua nation; but the languages have no resemblance. Of the\r\nOriente Indians we have already spoken. The tall, finely-built Cucámas\r\nnear Nauta are shrewd, hard-working canoe-men, notorious for the\r\nsingular desire of acquiring property; and the Yámeos, a white tribe,\r\nwander across the Marañon as far as Sarayacú. On the Ucayali are\r\nnumerous vagabond tribes, living for the most part in their canoes and\r\ntemporary huts. They are all lazy and faithless, using their wives\r\n(polygamy is common) as slaves. Infanticide is practiced, _i.e._,\r\ndeformed children they put out of the way, saying they belong to the\r\ndevil. They worship nothing. They bury their dead in a canoe or earthen\r\njar under the house (which is vacated forever), and throw away his\r\nproperty.[184] The common costume is a long gown, called _cushma_, of\r\nclosely-twilled cotton, woven by the women. Their weapons are two-edged\r\nbattle-axes of hard wood, as palo de sangre, and bows and arrows. The\r\narrows, five or six feet long, are made from the flower-stalk of the\r\narrow-grass (_Gynerium_), the head pointed with the flinty chonta and\r\ntipped with bone, often anointed with poison. At the base two rows of\r\nfeathers are spirally arranged, showing the Indian's knowledge of the\r\nrifle principle. When they have fixed abodes several families live\r\ntogether under one roof, with no division separating the women, as among\r\nthe Red Indians on the Pastassa. The roof is not over ten feet from the\r\nground. The Piros are the highest tribe; they have but one wife. The\r\nConibos are an agricultural people, yet cannibals, stretching from the\r\nUpper Ucayali to the sources of the Purus. They are a fair-looking,\r\nathletic people, and, like the Shipibos, of ten wear a piece of money\r\nunder the lip. The Cámpas are the most numerous and warlike.[185] They\r\nare little known, as travelers give them a wide berth. Herndon fancied\r\nthey were the descendants of the Inca race. They are said to be\r\ncannibals, and from the specimen we saw we should judge them uncommonly\r\nsharp. He was averse to telling us any thing about his tribe, but turned\r\nour questions with an equivocal repartee and a laugh. The Cashíbos, on\r\nthe Pachitéa, is another cannibal tribe. They are light colored and\r\nbearded. The dwarfish, filthy Rimos alone of the Ucayali Indians tattoo,\r\nthough not so perfectly as the Mundurucus, using black and blue colors.\r\nThe other tribes simply paint. It was among these wild Indians on the\r\nUcayali that the Franciscan friars labored so long and zealously, and\r\nwith a success far greater and more lasting than that which attended any\r\nother missionary enterprise in the valley.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: Near the sources of this river Castlenau locates the\r\nCanamas and Uginas; the former dwarfs, the latter having tails a palm\r\nand a half long--a hybrid from an Indian and Barigudo monkey.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: Query: Is the name Yagua (blood) derived from the\r\npractice of coloring the body red?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: Compare the ancient burial custom on the Andes: \"On the\r\ndecease of the Inca his palaces are abandoned: all his treasures, except\r\nthose that were employed in his obsequies, his furniture and apparel,\r\nwere suffered to remain as he left them, and his mansions, save one,\r\nwere closed up forever.\"--_Prescott_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: The women circumcise themselves, and a man will not marry\r\na woman who is not circumcised. They perform the singular rite upon\r\narriving at the age of puberty, and have a great feast at the time.\r\nOther tribes flog and imprison their daughters when they reach\r\nwomanhood.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining inhabitants of the Amazon are mixed-breeds, Negroes, and\r\nwhites. The amalgamations form the greater part of the population of the\r\nlarge towns. Von Tschudi gives a catalogue of twenty-three hybrids in\r\nPeru, and there are undoubtedly as many, or more, in Brazil. The most\r\ncommon are Mamelucos (offspring of white with Indian), Mulattoes (from\r\nwhite and Negro), Cafuzos or Zambos (from Indian and Negro), Curibocos\r\n(from Cafuzo and Indian); and Xibaros (from Cafuzo and Negro). \"To\r\ndefine their characteristics correctly,\" says Von Tschudi, \"would be\r\nimpossible, for their minds partake of the mixture of their blood. As a\r\ngeneral rule, it may be said that they unite in themselves all the\r\nfaults without any of the virtues of their progenitors. As men they are\r\ngenerally inferior to the pure races, and as members of society they are\r\nthe worst class of citizens.\" Yet they display considerable talent and\r\nenterprise, as in Quito; a proof that mental degeneracy does not\r\nnecessarily result from the mixture of white with Indian blood. \"There\r\nis, however,\" confesses Bates, after ten years' experience, \"a\r\nconsiderable number of superlatively lazy, tricky, and sensual\r\ncharacters among the half-castes, both in rural places and in the\r\ntowns.\" Our observations do not support the opinion that the result of\r\namalgamation is \"a vague compound, lacking character and expression.\"\r\nThe moral part is perhaps deteriorated; but in tact and enterprise they\r\noften excel their progenitors.\r\n\r\nNegroes are to be seen only on the Lower Amazon. By the new act of\r\nemancipation, such as are slaves continue so, but their children are\r\nfree. Negroes born in the country are called creoles.\r\n\r\nOf the white population, save a handful of English, French, and German,\r\nthe Portuguese immigrants are the most enterprising men on the river.\r\nThey are willing to work, trade, or do any thing to turn a penny. Those\r\nwho acquire a fortune generally retire to Lisbon. The Brazilians proper\r\nare the descendants of the men who declared themselves \"free and\r\nindependent\" of the mother country. Few of them are of pure Caucasian\r\ndescent, for the immigration from Portugal for many years has been\r\nalmost exclusively of the male sex. \"It is generally considered bad\r\ntaste in Brazil to boast purity of descent\" (Bates, i, 241). Brazilians\r\nare stiff and formal, yet courteous and lively, communicative and\r\nhospitable, well-bred and intelligent. They are not ambitious, but\r\ncontent to live and enjoy what nature spontaneously offers. The most a\r\nBrazilian wants is farina and coffee, a hammock and cigar. Brazilian\r\nladies have led a dreary life of constraint and silence, without\r\neducation or society, the husband making a nun of his wife after the old\r\nbigoted Portuguese notion; but during the last twenty years the doors\r\nhave been opened. Brazil attained her independence in 1823; Brazilian\r\nwomen in 1848.\r\n\r\nHere, in this virgin valley, where every plant is an evergreen,\r\npossessing the most agreeable and enjoyable climate in the world, with a\r\nbrilliant atmosphere, rivaled only by that of Quito, and with no changes\r\nof seasons--here we may locate the paradise of the lazy. Life may be\r\nmaintained with as little labor as in the Garden of Eden. Perhaps no\r\ncountry in the world is capable of yielding so large a return for\r\nagriculture. Nature, evidently designing this land as the home of a\r\ngreat nation, has heaped up her bounties of every description--fruits of\r\nrichest flavors, woods of finest grain, dyes of gayest colors, and drugs\r\nof rarest virtues; and left no sirocco or earthquake to disturb its\r\npeople. Providence, moreover, has given the present emperor a wise and\r\nunderstanding heart; and the government is a happy blending of imperial\r\ndignity and republican freedom. White, Negro, half-caste, and Indian may\r\nbe seen sitting side by side on the jury-bench. Certainly \"the nation\r\ncan not be a despicable one whose best men are able to work themselves\r\nup to positions of trust and influence.\"\r\n\r\nGod bless the Empire of the South!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n     How to Travel in South\r\n     America.--Routes.--Expenses.--Outfit.--Precautions.--Dangers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most vague and incorrect notions prevail in respect to traveling in\r\nSouth America. The sources of trustworthy and desirable information are\r\nvery meagre. Murray has not yet published a \"Hand-book for the Andes;\"\r\nroutes, methods, and expenses of travel are almost unknown; and the\r\nimagination depicts vampires and scorpions, tigers and anacondas, wild\r\nIndians and fevers without end, impassable rivers and inaccessible\r\nmountains as the portion of the tourist. The following statements, which\r\ncan be depended upon, may therefore be acceptable to those who\r\ncontemplate a trip on the Andes and the Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe shortest, cheapest, most feasible, and least interesting route\r\nacross the continent is from Valparaiso to Buenos Ayres. The breadth of\r\nSouth America is here only eight hundred miles. By railroad from\r\nValparaiso to the foot of the Andes; thence a short mule-ride by the\r\nUspallata Pass (altitude 12,000 feet), under the shadow of Aconcagua to\r\nMendoza; thence by coach across the pampas to the Rio Plata. The\r\nPortillo Pass (traversed by Darwin) is nearer, but more lofty and\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nBolivia offers the difficult path of Gibbon: From the coast to\r\nCochabamba; thence down the Marmoré and Madeira. There are three routes\r\nthrough Peru: First, from Lima to Mayro, by way of Cerro Pasco and\r\nHuánaco, by mule, ten days; thence down the Pachitéa, by canoe, six\r\ndays; thence down the Ucayali to Iquitos, by steamer, six days\r\n(forty-five hours' running time). When the road from Lima to Mayro is\r\nfinished the passage will be shortened four days. No snow is met in\r\ncrossing the Andes in summer, but in winter it is very deep. Second\r\n(Herndon's route), from Lima to Tinga Maria, by way of Huánaco, by mule,\r\nfifteen days, distance three hundred miles (the passage is difficult in\r\nthe rainy season); thence by canoe fifteen days down the Huallaga to\r\nYurimaguas. Third and best, by mule from Truxillo to Caximárca, five\r\ndays (note the magnificent ruins); thence to Chachapoyas, seven days\r\n(here are pre-Incarial relics); thence to Moyabamba, eight days; thence\r\non foot to Balsa Puerto, four days; thence by canoe to Yurimaguas, two\r\ndays. Price of a mule from Truxillo to Moyabamba is $30; canoe-hire,\r\n$10. The Peruvian steamers arrive at Yurimaguas the fifth of every month\r\nand leave the seventh; reach Nauta the ninth and Iquitos the tenth;\r\nleave Iquitos the sixteenth and arrive at Tabatinga the nineteenth, to\r\nconnect with the Brazilian line. Going up, they leave Tabatinga the\r\ntwenty-first and arrive at Iquitos the twenty-fourth, stopping six days.\r\nRunning time from Yurimaguas to Tabatinga, forty-eight hours; fare, $70,\r\ngold; third-class, $17. La Condamine's route, _via_ Loxa and the\r\nMarañon, is difficult; and Md. Godin's, _via_ the Pastassa, is perilous\r\non account of rapids and savages. The transit by the Napo we will now\r\ngive in detail.\r\n\r\nSix hundred dollars in gold will be amply sufficient for a first-class\r\npassage from New York to New York across the continent of South America,\r\nmaking no allowance for stoppages. For necessary expenses in Ecuador,\r\ntake a draft on London, which will sell to advantage in Guayaquil; so\r\nwill Mexican dollars. American gold should be taken for expenses on the\r\nAmazon in Brazil; at Pará it commands a premium. On the Marañon it is\r\nbelow par; Peruvian gold should therefore be bought at Guayaquil for\r\nthat part of the route. Also French _medios_, or quarter francs; they\r\nwill be very useful every where on the route, especially on the Upper\r\nAmazon, where change is scarce. Fifty dollars' worth will not be too\r\nmany; for, as the Scotchman said of sixpences, \"they are canny little\r\ndogs, and often do the work of shillings.\" Take a passport for Brazil.\r\nLeave behind your delicacies and superfluities of clothing; woolen\r\nclothes will be serviceable throughout. A trunk for mountain travel\r\nshould not exceed 24 by 15 by 15 inches--smaller the better. Take a\r\nrubber air-pillow and mattress: there is no bed between Guayaquil and\r\nPará. A hammock for the Amazon can be bought on the Napo.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Mail steamships, which leave New York on the first and\r\nsixteenth of each month, connect at Panama without delay with the\r\nBritish Steam Navigation line on the South Pacific. Fare, first-class,\r\nfrom New York to Guayaquil, by way of Panama and Paita, $215, gold;\r\nsecond-class, $128. Time to Panama, eight days; to Paita, four days; to\r\nGuayaquil, one day. A coasting steamer leaves Panama for Guayaquil the\r\nthirteenth of each month. There are two so-called hotels in Guayaquil.\r\n\"Los tres Mosqueteros,\" kept by Sr. Gonzales, is the best. Take a front\r\nroom ($1 per day), and board at the Fonda Italiana or La Santa Rosa ($1\r\nper day). Here complete your outfit for the mountains: saddle, with\r\nstrong girth and crupper; saddle-bags, saddle-cover, sweat-cloth, and\r\nbridle ($40, paper), woolen poncho ($9), rubber poncho ($4), blanket\r\n($6), leggins, native spurs and stirrups, knife, fork, spoon, tea-pot,\r\nchocolate (tea, pure and cheap, should be purchased at Panama), candles,\r\nmatches, soap, towels, and tarpaulin for wrapping up baggage. Convert\r\nyour draft into paper, _quantum sufficit_ for Guayaquil; the rest into\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nBesides this outer outfit, an inner one is needed--of patience without\r\nstint. You will soon learn that it is one thing to plan and quite\r\nanother to execute. \"To get out of the inn is one half of the journey\"\r\nis very appropriately a Spanish proverb. Spaniards do nothing\r\n_d'appressado_ (in a hurry), but every thing _mañana_ (to-morrow). You\r\nwill find fondas, horses, and roads divided into the bad, the worse, and\r\nthe worst, and bad is the best. But fret not thyself. \"Serenity of\r\nmind,\" wrote Humboldt, \"almost the first requisite for an undertaking in\r\ninhospitable regions, passionate love for some class of scientific\r\nlabor, and a pure feeling for the enjoyment which nature in her freedom\r\nis ready to impart, are elements which, when they meet together in an\r\nindividual, insure the attainment of valuable results from a great and\r\nimportant journey.\"\r\n\r\nThe journey to Quito must be made between May and November; in the rainy\r\nseason the roads are impassable. From Guayaquil to Bodegas by Yankee\r\nsteamer; fare, $2; time, eight hours. At Bodegas hire beasts at the\r\n_Consignacion_ for Guaranda; price for riding and cargo beasts, $4 each.\r\nNo extras for the _arriero_. A mule will carry two hundred and fifty\r\npounds. Buy bread at Bodegas and Guaranda. The Indians on the road are\r\nvery loth to sell any thing; buy a fowl, therefore, at the first\r\nopportunity, or you will have to live on dirty potato soup, and be glad\r\nof that. At the tambos, or wayside inns, you pay only for _yerba_\r\n(fodder). Never unsaddle your beast till it is cool; an Indian will even\r\nleave the bridle on for a time. To Guaranda, three full days. There take\r\nmules (safer than horses in climbing the mountains) for Quito; $6 25,\r\nsilver, per beast; time, five days. Be sure to leave Guaranda by 4 a.m.,\r\nfor in the afternoon Chimborazo is swept by furious winds. Also start\r\nwith a full stomach; you will get nothing for two days. Drink sparingly\r\nof the snow-water which dashes down the mountain. You will be tempted\r\nto curse Chuquipoyo; but thank heaven it is no worse.\r\n\r\nThere are two hotels in Quito, French and American; the former has the\r\nbetter location, the latter the better rooms. Best front room,\r\nfurnished, half a dollar a day; cheaper by the month. Meals (two),\r\ntwenty-five cents each. The beef is excellent, but the _cuisine_--oh,\r\nonions! \"God sends the meat, and the evil one cooks.\" You can hire a\r\nprofessional male cook (Indian) for $5 a month, but you can't teach him\r\nany thing. Fish is not to be had in Quito. Gibbon speaks of having some\r\nin Cuzco, but does not tell us where it came from.[186] Price of best\r\nflour, $3 60 per quintal; butter, thirty cents a pound; beef, $1 an\r\narroba (twenty-five pounds); refined sugar, $3 50 an arroba; brown sugar\r\n(_rapidura_),[187] five cents a pound; cigars, from six to sixteen for a\r\ndime; cigarettes, five cents a hundred. Horse hire, from fifty cents to\r\n$1 per day. If you are to remain some time, buy a beast: a good mule\r\ncosts $40; an ordinary horse, $50. The Post-office Department is a\r\nswindle. If you \"pay through\" you will find on your arrival home that\r\nyour letters have been paid at both ends. Ask our consul at Guayaquil to\r\nforward them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: The Guayaquil market is well supplied with fish of a fair\r\nquality. Usually the fish of warm tropical waters are poor, but the cold\r\n\"Humboldt current,\" which passes along the west coast of Ecuador,\r\nrenders them as edible as those of temperate zones.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: Called _chancaca_ in Peru. In flavor it is very nearly\r\nequal to maple-sugar.]\r\n\r\nThe necessary preparations for the Napo journey have been given in a\r\nprevious chapter (Chap. XI). We might add to the list a few cans of\r\npreserved milk from New York, for you will not see a drop between the\r\nAndes and the Atlantic. Fail not to take plenty of lienzo; you must have\r\nit to pay the Indians, and any surplus can be sold to advantage. A bale\r\nof thirty varas costs about five dollars. Rely not at all on game; a\r\nchampion sharpshooter could not live by his rifle. Santa Rosa and Coca\r\nwill be represented to you as small New Yorks; but you will do well if\r\nyou can buy a chicken between them.\r\n\r\nFrom Quito to Papallacta, two days and a half; riding beast, $2 silver,\r\nand $1 20 for each cargo of three arrobas. At Papallacta hire Indians\r\nfor Archidona; each carries three arrobas, and wants $5 silver in\r\nadvance. You take to your feet; time, nine days, including one day of\r\nrest at Baeza. At Archidona you take a new set of peons for Napo at\r\ntwenty-five cents apiece; time, one day. From Napo down the river to\r\nSanta Rosa, one day. You give two and a half varas of lienzo to each\r\nIndian, and the same for the canoe. From Santa Rosa to Pebas, on the\r\nMarañon, fifteen days; cost of an Indian, twenty-five varas; ditto for a\r\ncanoe. We advise you to stop at Coca and rig up a raft or craft of some\r\nkind; we ascribe our uninterrupted good health to the length and breadth\r\nof our accommodations. The Peruvian steamer from the west arrives at\r\nPebas on the sixteenth of each month; fare to Tabatinga, $15 gold; time,\r\nfour days; running time, eleven hours. Brazilian steamer leaves\r\nTabatinga the twentieth of each month; fare to Manáos, $44 44 gold;\r\ntime, five days; distance, one thousand miles. From Manáos to Pará, $55\r\n55 gold; time, six days; distance, one thousand miles. The Brazilian\r\nsteamers make semi-monthly trips. We found two hotels in Pará--the\r\n\"Italiana,\" dear and poor; the \"Diana,\" unpretending but comfortable.\r\nCharges at the latter for room and board, $2 a day. The best time for\r\ntraveling on the Amazon is between July and December. The United States\r\nand Brazilian steamships on their homeward voyage call at Pará the\r\nseventh of each month; fare to New York, $150 gold (the same as down the\r\nwhole length of the Amazon); second class, $75; time, fourteen days;\r\ndistance by way of St. Thomas, 1610 + 1400 miles. Steamer for Rio the\r\nninth of each month; fare, $125; time, twelve days; distance, 2190\r\nmiles. Fare from Rio to New York, $200. Fare by sailing vessel from Pará\r\nto New York, from $50 to $75; time, three weeks. A British steamer from\r\nRio stops at Pará and Lisbon.\r\n\r\nA word about health. First, take one grain of common-sense daily; do as\r\nthe natives do, keep out of the noon-day sun, and make haste slowly.\r\nSecondly, take with you quinine in two-grain pills, and begin to take\r\nthem before leaving New York, as the great African traveler, Du Chaillu,\r\nrecommended us. As preventive against the intermittent fevers on the\r\nlowlands and rivers, nothing is better than Dr. Copeland's celebrated\r\npills--quinine, twelve grains; camphor, twelve grains; cayenne pepper,\r\ntwelve grains. Mix with mucilage, and divide into twelve pills: take one\r\nevery night or morning as required. On the Amazon carry guarana. Woolen\r\nsocks are recommended by those who have had much experience of tropical\r\nfevers. Never bathe when the air is moist; avoid a chill; a native will\r\nnot bathe till the sun is well up. Rub yourself with _aguardiente_\r\n(native rum) after a bath, and always when caught in a shower. Freely\r\nexercise in Quito to ward off liver complaints. Drink little water;\r\ncoffee or chocolate is better, and tea is best. Avoid spirits with\r\nfruit, and fruit after dinner. The sickliest time in Guayaquil is at the\r\nbreaking up of the rainy season.\r\n\r\nAs to dangers: First, from the people. Traveling is as safe in Ecuador\r\nas in New York, and safer than in Missouri. There are no Spanish\r\nbanditti, though some places, as Chambo, near Riobamba, bear a bad name.\r\nIt is not wise to tempt a penniless footpad by a show of gold; but no\r\nmore so in Ecuador than any where. We have traveled from Guayaquil to\r\nDamascus, but have never had occasion to use a weapon in self-defense;\r\nand only once for offense, when we threatened to demolish an Arab sheik\r\nwith an umbrella. Secondly, from brutes. Some travelers would have us\r\ninfer that it is impossible to stir in South America without being\r\n\"affectionately entwined by a serpent, or sprung upon by a jaguar, or\r\nbitten by a rattlesnake; jiggers in every sand-heap and scorpions under\r\nevery stone\" (_Edinburgh Review_, xliii, 310). Padre Vernazza speaks of\r\nmeeting a serpent two yards in diameter! But you will be disappointed at\r\nthe paucity of animal life. We were two months on the Andes (August and\r\nSeptember) before we saw a live snake. They are plentiful in the wet\r\nseason in cacao plantations; but the majority are harmless. Dr. Russel,\r\nwho particularly studied the reptiles of India, found that out of\r\nforty-three species which he examined not more than seven had poisonous\r\nfangs; and Sir E. Tennent, after a long residence in Ceylon, declared he\r\nhad never heard of the death of an European by the bite of a snake. It\r\nis true, however, that the number and proportion of the venomous species\r\nare greater in South America than in any other part of the world; but it\r\nis some consolation to know that, zoologically, they are inferior in\r\nrank to the harmless ones; \"and certainly,\" adds Sidney Smith, \"a snake\r\nthat feels fourteen or fifteen stone stamping on his tail has little\r\ntime for reflection, and may be allowed to be poisonous.\" If bitten,\r\napply ammonia externally immediately, and take five drops in water\r\ninternally; it is an almost certain antidote. The discomforts and\r\ndangers arising from the animal creation are no greater than one would\r\nmeet in traveling overland from New York to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nFinally, of one thing the tourist in South America may be assured--that\r\ndear to him, as it is to us, will be the remembrance of those romantic\r\nrides over the Cordilleras amid the wild magnificence of nature, the\r\nadventurous walk through the primeval forest, the exciting canoe-life on\r\nthe Napo, and the long, monotonous sail on the waters of the Great\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM.\r\n\r\n    \"A life that all the Muses decked\r\n      With gifts of grace that might express\r\n      All comprehensive tenderness,\r\n    All-subtilizing intellect.\"--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the east of the city of Quito is a beautiful and extensive plain, so\r\nlevel that it is literally a _table-land_. It is the classic ground of\r\nthe astronomy of the eighteenth century: here the French and Spanish\r\nacademicians made their celebrated measurement of a meridian of the\r\nearth. As you stand on the edge of this plain just without the city, you\r\nsee the dazzling summit of Cayambi looking down from the north; on your\r\nleft are the picturesque defiles of Pichincha; on your right the slopes\r\nof Antisana. Close by you, standing between the city and the plain, is a\r\nhigh white wall inclosing a little plot, like the city above, \"four\r\nsquare.\" You are reminded by its shape, and also by its position\r\nrelative to Quito and Pichincha, of that other sacred inclosure just\r\noutside the walls of Jerusalem and at the foot of Olivet, the Garden of\r\nGethsemane. This is the Protestant Cemetery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P. Staunton]\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of our late representative--now also numbered with\r\nthe dead--this place was assigned by the government for the interment of\r\nforeigners who do not die in the Romish faith. And there we buried our\r\nfellow-traveler, COLONEL PHINEAS STAUNTON, the artist of the expedition,\r\nand Vice-Chancellor of Ingham University, New York. On the 8th of\r\nSeptember, 1867, we bore him through the streets of Quito to this\r\nquiet resting-place, without parade and in solemn silence--just as we\r\nbelieve his unobtrusive spirit would have desired, and just as his\r\nSavior was carried from the cross to the sepulchre. No splendid hearse\r\nor nodding plumes; no long procession, save the unheard tread of the\r\nangels; no requiem, save the unheard harps of the seraphs. We gave him a\r\nProtestant Christian burial, such as Quito never saw. In this corner of\r\nnature's vast cathedral, the secluded shrine of grandeur and beauty not\r\nfound in Westminster Abbey, we left him. We parted with him on the mount\r\nwhich is to be the scene of his transfiguration.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for an artist to find a grave whose surroundings\r\nare so akin to his feelings. He lies in the lofty lap of the Andes, and\r\nsnow-white pinnacles stand around him on every side, just as we imagine\r\nthe mountains are around the city of God. We think we hear him saying,\r\nas Fanny Kemble Butler said of another burial-ground: \"I will not rise\r\nto trouble any one if they will let me sleep here. I will only ask to be\r\npermitted, once in a while, to raise my head and look out upon this\r\nglorious scene.\" No dark and dismal fogs gather at evening about that\r\nspot. It lies nearer to heaven than any other Protestant cemetery in the\r\nworld. \"It is good (says Beecher) to have our mortal remains go upward\r\nfor their burial, and catch the earliest sounds of that trumpet which\r\nshall raise the dead.\" And the day is coming when that precious vein of\r\ngold that now lies in the bosom of the mighty Andes shall leave its\r\nrocky bed and shine in seven-fold purity. Indeed, the artist is already\r\nin that higher studio among the mountains of Beulah.\r\n\r\nA simple sculptured obelisk of sorrow stands over the dust of Colonel\r\nStaunton: his most fitting monument is his own life-work. He was the\r\nvery painter Humboldt longed for in his writings--\"the artist, who,\r\nstudying in nature's great hot-house bounded by the tropics, should add\r\na new and more magnificent kingdom of nature to art.\" Colonel Staunton,\r\ntrue and lovely in his own character, was ever seeking in nature for\r\nwhatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are pure, and now was\r\nabout to add whatsoever things are grand. He was a _Christian_ artist,\r\nin sympathy with such men as Raphael and Leonardo de Vinci. \"The\r\nhabitual choice of sacred subjects (says Ruskin) implies that the\r\npainter has a natural disposition to dwell on the highest thoughts of\r\nwhich humanity is capable.\" No shallow or false person could have\r\nconceived his _Ascension_. Only the highest qualities of the intellect\r\nand heart--a soul already half ascended--could have given such ethereal\r\nlightness to those \"two men in white apparel.\" Only the pure in heart\r\nsee God.

It\r\nis not found on the rocks, like the orchilla of the Old World, but grows\r\non various trees. The foliage of a tree disappears when the orchilla\r\ncommences. The sea air is indispensable to its production, as it is\r\nfound only near the coast.\r\n\r\n_Religious Intolerance_, p. 91.--The expression \"Protestant dogs\" has\r\nsince been publicly repeated by a priest in a sermon, who told the\r\npeople to confess, or they would be treated in a similar way. It called\r\nforth a remonstrance from Mr. Hamilton, the British Minister, directed\r\nto the archbishop, declaring such conduct inhuman and unchristian. The\r\nPope's Nuncio left Quito for good in July, 1869.\r\n\r\n_Fish in the Quito Valley_, p. 107.--Dr. Gill informs me that the true\r\nname of this little fish is _Cyclopium Humboldtii_, Swainson. It belongs\r\nto the sub-family Trachelypterinæ, under Siluridæ.\r\n\r\n_Hummers' Nests_, p. 108.--They are not always of a lengthened form, as\r\nthe text would imply, but are sometimes quite shallow. They are\r\ninvariably lined with the softest vegetable materials and covered with\r\nmoss. The nests are not as compact as those of our Northern hummer, and,\r\nso far as we observed, are never shingled with flat lichens.\r\n\r\n_Humboldt in 1802_, p. 156.--He spent five months in the valley of\r\nQuito.\r\n\r\n_Pebas Fossils_, p. 282.--In a letter to the author, Mr. Darwin says:\r\n\"Your discovery of marine shells high up the Amazon possesses _extreme_\r\ninterest, not only in itself, but as one more most striking instance how\r\nrash it is to assert that any deposit is not a marine formation because\r\nit does not contain fossils. As for myself, I never believed for a\r\nmoment in Agassiz's idea of the origin of the Amazonian formation.\"\r\nAgassiz \"candidly confesses (Lyell's _Principles_, i., 468) that he\r\nfailed to discover any of those proofs which we are accustomed to\r\nregard, even in temperate latitudes, as essential for the establishment\r\nof the former existence of glaciers where they are now no more. No\r\nglaciated pebbles, or far-transported angular blocks with polished and\r\nstriated sides; no extensive surface of rock, smooth, and traversed by\r\nrectilinear furrows, were observed.\" The fossiliferous bed at Pebas is\r\nas plainly _in situ_ as the Medina sandstone at Genesee Falls.\r\n\r\n_Tropical Flowers_, p. 292.--\"During twelve years spent amid the\r\ngrandest tropical vegetation, I have seen nothing comparable to the\r\neffect produced on our landscapes by gorse, broom, heather, wild\r\nhyacinths, hawthorns, purple orchises, and buttercups.\"--Wallace's\r\n_Malay Archipelago_.\r\n\r\n_Coca-plant_, p. 293.--The engraving conveys the impression that the\r\nleaves are parallel-veined; but the coca is a dicotyledon, with the\r\nunder surface of the leaf strongly marked with veins, of which two, in\r\naddition to the midrib, run parallel with the margin.\r\n\r\n_Pedrero_, Map.--This town on the Rio Negro is also written _Pedreira_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdobe dwellings, page 46.\r\n\r\nAgassiz, Mount, 250.\r\n  Prof., on the geology of the Amazonian valley, 280, 282, 347.\r\n\r\nAgriculture on the
