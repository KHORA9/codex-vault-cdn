So we have now a few words to say about\r\n\"La Savoyarde\"--the name of the great bell which is designed for it,\r\nand which has just been cast at Annecy-le-Vieux, in Upper Savoy, in\r\nthe presence of Mgr. Leuilleux, Archbishop of Chambery, Mgr. Isoar,\r\nBishop of Annecy, and of all the clergy united, at the foundry of\r\nMessrs. G. & F. Paccard, especially decorated for the occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE BELL.]\r\n\r\nOne of the Latin inscriptions that ornament the metal of \"La\r\nSavoyarde\" at once explains to us its name and tells us why a bell\r\ndesigned for the capital was cast at Annecy-le-Vieux. The following is\r\na translation of it:\r\n\r\n    \"In the year 1888, in the course of the solemnities of the\r\n    sacerdotal jubilee of the Sovereign Pontifex Leo XIII., I,\r\n    Frances Margaret of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, on the\r\n    initiative of Francis Albert Leuilleux, Archbishop of\r\n    Chambery, with the co-operation of the bishops of the\r\n    province, at the common expense of the clergy and upper and\r\n    lower classes of Savoy, was offered as a gift, as a\r\n    testimonial of piety toward the divine heart, in order to\r\n    repeat through the ages, from the top of the holy hill, to the\r\n    city, to the nation and to the entire world, 'Hail Jesus!'\"\r\n\r\nLet us now witness the casting of the bell.\r\n\r\nOver there, at the back of the foundry, in the reverberatory furnace,\r\nthe alloy of copper and tin, in the proportions of 78 and 22 per\r\ncent., is in fusion. From the huge crucible runs a conduit to the pit,\r\nat the side of which the furnace is constructed, and in which is\r\nplaced the mould. A metallic plug intercepts communication. A quick\r\nblow with an iron rod removes this plug and the tapping is effected.\r\nThis operation, which seems simple at first sight, is extremely\r\ndelicate in practice and requires a very skillful workman. A host of\r\ntechnical words designates the dangers that it presents. Before the\r\ntapping, it is necessary to calculate at a glance the function of the\r\ngate pit. And what accidents afterward! But we need not dwell upon\r\nthese. After the cooling of the metal comes the cleaning, which is\r\ndone with scrapers and special instruments.\r\n\r\nThe casting is preceded by two operations--the designing and the\r\nmoulding. The design rests upon a basis generally furnished by\r\nexperience, and which the founders have transmitted from generation to\r\ngeneration. The thickness of the rim of the bell taken as unity\r\ndetermines the diameters and dimensions. The outline most usually\r\nfollowed gives 15 rims to the large diameter, 7½ to the upper part of\r\nthe bell, and 32 to the large radius that serves to trace the profiles\r\nof the external sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASTING OF THE GREAT BELL OF THE BASILICA OF THE\r\nSACRED HEART.]\r\n\r\nThe moulding is done as follows: In the pit where the casting is to be\r\ndone there is constructed a core of bricks and a clay shell, separated\r\nfrom each other by a thickness of earth, called false bell. This\r\noccupies provisionally the place of the metal, and will be destroyed\r\nat the moment of the casting.\r\n\r\nNow let us give a brief description of \"La Savoyarde.\" Its total\r\nweight is 25,000 kilogrammes, divided as follows: 16,500 kilogrammes\r\nof bronze, 800 kilogrammes for the clapper, and the rest for the\r\nsuspension gear.\r\n\r\nIts height is 3.06 meters and its width at the base is 3.03. It is\r\ntherefore as high as it is wide, and, as may be seen from our\r\nengraving, two men can easily seat themselves in its interior. In\r\nweight, it exceeds the bell of Notre Dame, of Paris, which weighs\r\n17,170 kilogrammes, that of the Cathedral of Sens, which weighs\r\n16,230, and that of the Amiens bell, which weighs 11,000. But it\r\ncannot be compared to the famous bell given by Eudes Rigauit,\r\nArchbishop of Rouen, to the cathedral of that city, and which was so\r\nbig and heavy that it was necessary to give a copious supply of\r\nstimulants to those who rang it, in order \"to encourage\" them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT BELL OF THE BASILICA OF THE SACRED HEART.]\r\n\r\n\"La Savoyarde\" will appear small also if we compare it with some\r\ncelebrated bells, that of the Kremlin of Moscow, for example, which\r\nweighs 201,216 kilogrammes. One detail in conclusion: \"La Savoyarde\"\r\nsounds in counter C. This had been desired and foreseen. The number of\r\nvibrations, that is to say, the _timbre_ of a bell, is in inverse\r\nratio of its diameter or of the cubic root of its weight, so that in\r\ncalculating the diameters and in designing \"La Savoyarde\" the _timbre_\r\nwas calculated at the same time.--_L'Illustration._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[FROM THE SUGAR BEET.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SUGAR ITEMS.\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater that has been used to wash frozen beets contains a small\r\npercentage of sugar. As the washing period, in such cases, is longer\r\nthan with normal beets, the sugar in beet cells has time to pass\r\nthrough the outer walls by osmosis. The sugar loss is said to be 0.66\r\nper cent. (?) of the weight of beets washed.\r\n\r\nWell conducted experiments show that in small but well ventilated\r\nsilos, beets lose considerable weight, but very little sugar. On the\r\nother hand, in large silos with poor ventilation, the sugar loss\r\nfrequently represents four to six per cent. When fermentation\r\ncommences, the mass of roots is almost ruined.\r\n\r\nSodic nitrate, if used upon soil late in the season, may overcome a\r\ndifficulty that has been recently noticed. Beet fields located near\r\nswamps that are dry a portion of the year have suffered from a malady\r\nthat turns leaves from green to yellow, even before harvesting period;\r\nsuch beets have lost a considerable amount of sugar.\r\n\r\nA new method for the analysis of saccharose and raffinose, when in the\r\npresence of inverted sugar, is said to give accurate results. The\r\nprocess consists in adding sulphate of copper and lime to hot\r\nmolasses, so that the oxide of copper is changed to a protoxide, and\r\nthe invert sugar becomes water and carbonic acid. The whole is\r\nneutralized with phosphoric acid. There follow a great number of\r\nprecipitates; the exact volume of liquid in which these are found is\r\ndetermined after two polariscopic observations.\r\n\r\nIt has been constantly noticed that samples of carbonatated juice vary\r\nin composition with the part of tank from which they are taken. If\r\nsome arrangement could be made assuring a thorough mixing during the\r\npassage of carbonic acid, results would be more satisfactory than they\r\nnow are. If gas could be distributed in every part of the tank, the\r\nlime combination could be made perfect.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the new law regulating quantity of sugar to be used in\r\nwines, ciders, etc., there has been, during 1890, an increase of\r\nnearly 13,000 tons, as compared with 1889. Consumption of sugar for\r\nthese special industries was 33,000 tons; alcohol thus added to wine\r\nwas about 71,000,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nBeets cultivated without extra fertilizers, and that are regular in\r\nshape and in good condition, without bruises, are the ones which give\r\nthe best results in silos. It is recommended to construct silos of two\r\ntypes; one which is to be opened before first frost, the other where\r\nbeets remain for several months and are protected against excessive\r\ncold. Great care should be taken that a thorough ventilation be given\r\nin the first mentioned type. In the other, more substantial silos,\r\nventilation must be watched, and all communication with the exterior\r\nclosed as soon as the temperature falls to or near freezing.\r\n\r\nDuring the last campaign many manufacturers experienced great\r\ndifficulty in keeping the blades of slicers sufficiently sharp to work\r\nfrozen beets. Sharpening of blades is an operation attended to by\r\nspecial hands at the factory; and under ordinary circumstances there\r\nneed be no difficulty. However, it is now proposed to have central\r\nstations that will make a specialty of blade sharpening. Under these\r\ncircumstances manufacturers located in certain districts need give the\r\nmatter no further thought, let the coming winter be as severe as it\r\nmay.\r\n\r\nSome success has been obtained by the use of sulphurous acid in vacuum\r\npans. Great care is required; the operation cannot be done by an\r\nordinary workman. It is claimed that graining thereby is more rapid\r\nand better than is now possible. Chemists agree that the operation is\r\nmore effectual by bringing sulphurous acid in contact with sirups\r\nrather than juices; it is in the sirups that the coloring pigments are\r\nfound. Sulphurous acid is run into the pan until the sirups cover the\r\nsecond coil. In all cases the work must be done at a low temperature.\r\n\r\nHeight of juice in carbonatating tanks is only three feet in France,\r\nwhile in Austria it is frequently twelve feet. The question of a\r\nchange in existing methods is being discussed; it necessitates an\r\nincrease in the blowing capacity of machine; since carbonic acid gas\r\nhas a greater resistance to overcome in Austrian than in French\r\nmethods. Longer the period juices are in contact with carbonic acid,\r\ngreater will be the effect produced.\r\n\r\nFerric sulphate has been very little used for refuse water\r\npurification, owing to cost of its manufacture. If roasted pyrites, a\r\nwaste product of certain chemical factories, are sprinkled with\r\nsulphuric acid of 66° B., and thoroughly mixed for several hours, at a\r\ntemperature of 100° to 156° F., the pyrites will soon be covered with\r\na white substance which is ferric sulphate. Precipitates from ferric\r\nsulphate, unlike calcic compounds, do not subsequently enter into\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nEfforts are being made to convince manufacturers of the mistake in\r\nusing decanting vats, in connection with first and second\r\ncarbonatation. In Germany filter presses are used, decanting vats are\r\nobsolete. The main objection to them is cooling of saccharine liquors,\r\nwhich means an ultimate increase in fuel. Cooling is frequently\r\nfollowed by partial fermentation.\r\n\r\nFurther changes in the proposed combined baryta-soda method for juice\r\npurification consist in using powdered soda carbonate 90-92°, upon\r\nbeet cossettes as they leave the slicer, before entering the diffusor.\r\nThe quantity of chemical to be used is 1/1000 of weight of beet slices\r\nbeing treated. If a diffusor has a capacity of 2,500 lb., there would\r\nbe added 2.5 lb. soda carbonate. From the diffusor is subsequently\r\ntaken 316 gallons juice at 4-5° density, this is rapidly heated to\r\n185°F., then 2.4 of a pure baryta solution is added; temperature is\r\nkept at 185° F. for a short time; resulting precipitates fall to\r\nbottom of tank; then 13 gallons milk of lime 25° B. are added.\r\n\r\nOther operations that follow are as usual. It is contended that the\r\ncost of baryta is 10 cents per ton beets worked. The most important\r\nadvantage is gain in time; a factory working 20,000 during a 100-day\r\ncampaign, by the foregoing process can accomplish the same work in 80\r\ndays, thus decreasing wear and tear of plant and diminishing\r\npercentage of sugar lost in badly constructed silos.\r\n\r\nThe exact influence of a low temperature upon beet cells has never\r\nbeen satisfactorily settled. Considerable light has recently been\r\nthrown upon the subject by a well known chemist. It is asserted that\r\nliving cells containing a saccharine liquid do not permit infiltration\r\nfrom interior to exterior; this phenomenon occurs only when cell and\r\ntissue are dead. It is necessary that the degree of cold should be\r\nsufficiently intense, or that a thaw take place, under certain\r\nconditions, to kill tissue of walls of said cells. An interesting fact\r\nis that when cells are broken through the action of freezing, it is\r\nnot those containing sugar that are the first affected. The outer\r\ncells containing very little sugar are the first to expand when\r\nfrozen, which expansion opens the central cells.\r\n\r\nExperiments to determine the action of lime upon soils apparently\r\nprove that it does not matter in what form calcic salts are employed;\r\ntheir effect, in all cases, is to increase the yield of roots to the\r\nacre. On the other hand, very secondary results were obtained with\r\nphosphoric and sulphuric acids.\r\n\r\nA micro-mushroom, a parasite that kills a white worm, enemy of the\r\nbeet, has been artificially cultivated. As soon as the worm is\r\nattacked, the ravage continues until the entire body of the insect is\r\none mass of micro-organisms. Spores during this period are constantly\r\nformed. If it were possible to spread this disease in districts\r\ninfected by the white worm, great service could be rendered to beet\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nIn sugar refining it is frequently desirable to determine the\r\nviscosity of sirups, molasses, etc. Methods founded upon the rapidity\r\nof flow through an orifice of a known size are not mathematical in\r\ntheir results. A very simple plan, more accurate than any hitherto\r\nthought of, is attracting some attention. Sensitive scales and a\r\nthermometer suspended in a glass tube are all the apparatus necessary.\r\nThe exact weight of thermometer, with tube, is determined; they are\r\nimmersed in water and weighed for the second time; the difference in\r\nweight before and afterward gives the weight of adhering water. If the\r\noperation is repeated in molasses, we in the same way obtain the\r\nweight of adhering liquid, which, if divided by the weight of adhering\r\nwater, gives the viscosity as compared with water.\r\n\r\nSugar refineries located at Marseilles claim that it is cheaper for\r\nthem to purchase sugar in Java than beet sugar of northern Europe. On\r\nthe other hand, the argument of Paris refiners is just the reverse.\r\nThe total refined sugar consumed is 375,000 tons, the colonial and\r\nindigenous production of raw sugar is nearly 1,000,000 tons more than\r\nsufficient to meet the demands of the entire refining industry of the\r\ncountry. There appears to have been considerable manipulation, foreign\r\nsugar being imported with the view of producing a panic, followed by a\r\ndecline of market prices, after which Marseilles refiners would buy.\r\nAll sound arguments are in favor of protecting the home sugar\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that manufacturers weigh the fuel used more\r\ncarefully than hitherto; the extra trouble would soon lead to economy\r\nfor all interested in sugar production at ruinous cost. Some chemists\r\nadvocate that coal be purchased only after having been analyzed.\r\nEfforts to have a unification in methods of analysis of all products\r\nof factory is a move in the right direction; the Association of Sugar\r\nChemists have adopted a series of methods that are in the future to be\r\nconsidered as standard.\r\n\r\nCopper solutions are destined to render great service in the\r\ndestruction of micro-organisms that attack the beet field. The liquid\r\nused should be composed of 3 per cent. copper sulphate and 3 per cent.\r\nlime, dissolved in water; fifty gallons are sufficient for one acre;\r\ncost per acre, every item included, is 56 cents. The normal vitality\r\nof the plant being restored, there follows an increased sugar\r\npercentage. Ordinary liquid ammonia may be advantageously used to kill\r\nwhite worms and insects that attack beets; two quarts of the diluted\r\nchemical are used per square yard, and the cost is $12 per acre (?)\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY.\r\n\r\nCalcic salt elimination from beet juices is a problem not yet\r\nsatisfactorily solved. Since the early history of beet sugar making,\r\nit has been noticed that calcic salts render graining in the pan most\r\ntedious; hence repeated efforts to reduce to a minimum percentage the\r\nuse of lime during defecation. In all cases it is essential to get rid\r\nof inverted sugar. The difficulty from excess of lime is overcome by\r\nadding it now and then during carbonatation; but other means are found\r\ndesirable; and phosphoric acid, magnesia, soda, etc., have been used\r\nwith success. Recent observations relating to the action of soda upon\r\ncalcic sulphates, calcic glucates, etc., are most important. Certain\r\ncitrates have a retarding influence upon calcic sulphates.\r\n\r\nAn alarm contrivance to announce the passage of juices into condensing\r\npipes has rendered considerable service in beet sugar factories.\r\n\r\nA process for refining sugar in the factory, at less cost than it is\r\npossible to make raw sugar by existing processes, deserves notice.\r\nSugars by this new method test 99.8, and sirups from the same have a\r\npurity coefficient of 70. Weight of dry crystals obtained is said to\r\nrepresent 66 per cent. of _masse cuite_ used. The additional cost of\r\nthe process is $30 to $40 per centrifugal. Concentrated juice or sirup\r\nmay be used as _cleare_ in centrifugals; this sirup should have a\r\ndensity of 1.325 (36° B.) at 113° to 122° F., so as not to redissolve\r\nthe sugar. Sirup should not be used until all adhering sirup of _masse\r\ncuite_ has been swung out. The sirup, after passing through\r\ncentrifugals, may be sent to second carbonatation tanks and mixed with\r\njuices being treated.\r\n\r\nThe larva of an insect, known as _sylpha_, has attacked beet fields in\r\nseveral parts of Saxony. The effect upon the root is a decrease in\r\nfoliage, followed by late development of the beet, with corresponding\r\nreduction in sugar percentage. Chickens may render excellent service,\r\nas they eat these worms with considerable relish. A solution of\r\nSchweinfurt green has been used with some success; its cost is $2.50\r\nper acre. None of the chemical remains on the leaves after a rain (?)\r\nWhite worms have done some damage; they should be collected from the\r\nfields during plowing. When they become beetles in the spring, they\r\nmay be destroyed by a solution of sulphide of carbon; $0.20 worth of\r\nthis chemical is sufficient to kill 10,000 of them. These beetles\r\ncontain 50 per cent of fatty and nitric elements; when pulverized they\r\nmay be used as good for pigs and chickens. If the ground mass of\r\nbeetles is sprinkled with sulphuric acid and a reasonable amount of\r\nlime and earth be added, the combination forms an excellent fertilizer\r\nfor certain crops. A disease that blackens young beet leaves is found\r\nto be due to a microscopic insect. If the beet seed be saturated in a\r\nphenic solution before planting, the difficulty may be overcome.\r\n\r\nWe are soon to have a new method for selecting mothers for seed\r\nproduction. Details of the same are not yet public. It is claimed that\r\nit will be possible to grow seed that will yield beets of a given\r\nquality determined in advance, a problem which has hitherto been\r\nthought impossible.\r\n\r\nIt will surprise many of our readers to learn that if \"tops\" or even\r\nhalf beets are planted, they will give seed, the quality of which is\r\nabout same; showing that as soon as seed stalks commence to appear,\r\nthe _role_ of the root proper is of secondary consideration, as it\r\nserves simply as a medium between the beet and soil(?)\r\n\r\nSprayed water may be used with considerable success in washing sugar\r\nin centrifugals; it is claimed that this new process offers many\r\nadvantages over either steam, water, or use of _cleare_. White sugar\r\nto be washed is thoroughly mixed with a sugar sirup supersaturated.\r\nThe whole is run into centrifugals. The sirup swung from the same is\r\nused in next and following operations; when it becomes too thick it is\r\nsent to the vacuum pan to be regrained. The operation of washing lasts\r\nless than two minutes; three quarts of water are necessary for 200 lb.\r\nsugar. The water spray at a pressure of 5 to 10 atmospheres is\r\nproduced by a very simple appliance.\r\n\r\nTotal weight of refuse cossettes obtained during last campaign was\r\n4,000,000 tons, about 700,000 tons of which were sold for $1,000,000;\r\nif what remains is dried, it would be worth $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nSeveral sodic-baryta methods have been recently invented. Of these we\r\nwill mention one where 1/4000 to 1/2000 part of calcined soda is added\r\nto the beet slices in diffusors. The juice when drawn from the battery\r\nis heated to 154° F., and defecated with hydrate of baryta and milk of\r\nlime. Nearly all foreign substances are thus eliminated. Carbonatation\r\nthen follows.\r\n\r\nGovernment taxation upon the sugar industry is destined within a few\r\nyears to be withdrawn. The new law recently put into operation no\r\nlonger taxes beets worked at factory, but the sugar manufactured. The\r\nrate of taxation is about 2 cents per pound on all sugar made.\r\n\r\nRecent data from northeast Germany give the work during campaign\r\n1890-91 of 54 associated beet sugar factories. They used 2,130,000\r\ntons beets, obtained from 142,602 acres of land, average yield 12\r\ntons. The total sugar amounted to 251,000 tons, of which 241,000 were\r\nfrom beets and 10,000 tons from molasses worked by special processes.\r\nThe polarization of beet juices averaged 13.09; _masse cuite_, 14.31;\r\nextraction of sugar of all grades, 11.79. It required 848 lb. beets to\r\nproduce 100 lb. sugar.\r\n\r\nIn every center where beet sugar is made there exists some local\r\nsociety; each year members from these societies meet to exchange views\r\nupon the sugar situation of the empire.\r\n\r\nOf late, there has been a general complaint respecting quality of\r\nsugar sold on the Magdeburg market. At one time the sugars averaged\r\nmore organic substances than ash; now there is more ash than organic\r\nsubstances. Such sugars are most difficult to work, and cause much\r\nloss of time in centrifugals.\r\n\r\nThe most desirable temperature for diffusion batteries is not yet\r\ndefinitely settled. Some manufacturers recommend 82° to 86° F. On the\r\nother hand, satisfactory results have been obtained at 145° F.,\r\nfollowed by cold water in the diffusors.\r\n\r\nThe use of hydrofluoric acid, even in small quantities to prevent\r\nfermentation, should not be allowed.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to use hydrogen dioxide for saccharine juice\r\npurification. The alkalinity of juice is reduced to 0.07 by a\r\njudicious use of lime. Precaution must be taken to keep the\r\ntemperature at 87° F. After a preliminary filtration about 4 per cent.\r\nhydrogen dioxide is added. The whole is then heated to the boiling\r\npoint, after which ½ to 1 per cent. lime is added. When alkalinity of\r\nfiltrate is 0.03 phosphoric acid and magnesia are added, in quantities\r\nrepresenting 0.03 per cent. of sugar in juice for magnesia, and 0.6\r\nper cent. for the phosphoric acid. In working beet juices hydrogen\r\ndioxide may be used in the diffusor or during any phase of the sugar\r\nmanufacturing process, even upon sugars in centrifugals. In all cases\r\nthe results obtained are said to be most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nA method to crystallize the sugar contained in the mother liquor of a\r\n_masse cuite_ consists in mixing during 24 hours the hot product,\r\ndirect from the pan, with low grade molasses. Gradual cooling follows.\r\nThe crystals of _masse cuite_ effect a crystallization of the\r\notherwise inactive product contained in the molasses. The separation\r\nof crystals from adhering molasses is done in a special washing\r\nappliance arranged in battery form.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently asked if the existing and accepted formula for\r\ndetermining in advance the amount of refined sugar that may be\r\nextracted from either beets, _masse cuite_ or raw sugar, is to be\r\nconsidered exact, without special allowance being made for raffinose.\r\nAn intelligent discussion upon the subject shows that the sugar in\r\nquestion, whether present or not, in no way influences the formula\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA-HUNGARY.\r\n\r\nThe committee on exhibition at Prague has issued several interesting\r\npamphlets, from which we learn that in Bohemia, in 1819, there existed\r\none beet sugar factory. In 1890 the total number of factories was 140;\r\nlast year 370,000 acres were planted in beets, and the yield was\r\n3,700,000 tons; yield of sugar averaged 2,700 lb. per acre; 40,000\r\nhands were employed. During the past 24 years 17,900,000 tons of coal\r\nhave been consumed, and the working capacity per factory is now far\r\ngreater than formerly. There are at present seven sugar refineries in\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\nCommercial arrangements with Germany having terminated favorably,\r\ngreat pressure is being brought to bear upon Italy, Roumania, Servia\r\nand Switzerland, to induce them to enter into a treaty. Sugars\r\nimported by the country last named were 35,892 tons in 1889 and 43,300\r\ntons during 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\nIf fresh cossettes are fed to cows, in quantities per diem\r\nrepresenting 20 per cent. of the animal's weight, they have a thinning\r\neffect. When the refuse has been siloed for eight months, and 12 per\r\ncent. of the animal's weight is used, there will follow a slight daily\r\nincrease in weight. Better results may be obtained from cossettes that\r\nhave been kept for two years; with the latter, if cows eat only 7 per\r\ncent. of their weight, considerable fattening follows. Consequently,\r\nwhile beet refuse, after long keeping, loses 50 per cent. of its\r\nweight, it appears in the end to be more economical for feeding\r\npurposes than fresh cossettes direct from the battery.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of keeping the percentage of water remains nearly\r\nconstant; fatty substances which were 0.08 per cent. become 0.74; and\r\nthe percentage of carbohydrates diminishes. Chemists are unable to\r\nexplain the changes that have taken place; if they are desirable, as\r\nthey appear to be, judging from the practical results just cited,\r\nthere is this question to be solved: What future have dried cossettes?\r\nEvidently they offer advantages, as no one can doubt, such as a\r\ndecrease in weight and bulk, easy keeping for an indefinite time, etc.\r\nAt present, there is building a silo to contain 4,000 tons fresh\r\ncossettes; this is to have the best possible system of drainage.\r\nDuring the coming season it is proposed to analyze the water draining\r\nfrom this mass of fermenting refuse; and we may then learn more than\r\nwe now know about the chemical changes above mentioned.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of M. Sachs asks why it is not possible to use live\r\nsteam in defecating tanks. A simple calculation shows that the water\r\nto be subsequently evaporated would be increased 10 per cent. This\r\nevaporation would cost more than cleaning of copper coils, etc.,\r\ncombined with other difficulties existing appliances offer.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the most desirable number of beets necessary to\r\nanalyze to obtain an average has been in part settled. Factories\r\nworking 500 tons per diem should make at least 200 analyses of beets\r\nreceived, which work offers no difficulty by the rapid methods now\r\nused. Several samples should be taken from every cart load delivered,\r\nthen make average selections from the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nWeak currents of electricity, 0.03 to 0.04 ampere, have been passed\r\nthrough sirups for fourteen hours without any special increase in\r\npurity coefficient. Experiments made upon diluted molasses or with raw\r\nbeet juices were not encouraging.\r\n\r\nMixing of filter press scums with diffusion juices is said to offer\r\nspecial advantages for the preliminary purification. Not over one to\r\ntwo per cent. of scums should be used. If in too great quantity, the\r\nraw juices will yield inferior results. During operations that follow,\r\nexperiments are not yet sufficiently advanced to determine with\r\ncertainty within what limits the refuse scum utilization process is to\r\nbe recommended. We have great doubts as to the wisdom of introducing\r\nforeign elements, eliminated from other juices in a previous\r\noperation, into a juice fresh from the battery.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\nThe beet sugar factory in Japan is said to be working with\r\nconsiderable success.\r\n\r\nThis year in Europe over 3,000,000 acres are devoted to beet\r\ncultivation. If the yield averages 12 tons, the crop of roots to be\r\nworked during campaign 1891-92 will certainly not be less than\r\n36,000,000 tons, with a total yield of first grade sugar of about\r\n7,300,000,000 lb.\r\n\r\nSugar sells for 9 cents per pound in Persia, where Russia has almost a\r\nmonopoly of that business.\r\n\r\nFinland imported, during 1889, 9,416 tons sugar, valued at $1,000,000.\r\nGermany supplied two-thirds of this at cheaper rates than Russia,\r\nowing to facilities of transportation. Two refineries are working; one\r\nof these uses exclusively cane sugar, while the other employs both\r\ncane and beet sugar.\r\n\r\nA beet sugar factory in England, that has been idle for many years, is\r\nto resume operations under a new company, adopting the plan of growing\r\na sufficient quantity of beets for an average campaign, independently\r\nof what all the farmers of the locality propose to do.\r\n\r\nSiberia is to have a beet sugar factory. Experiments in beet\r\ncultivation have shown excellent beets may be raised there. Special\r\nadvantages are offered by the Russian government, and factories are to\r\nbe exempt from taxation daring a period of ten years. Sugar in Siberia\r\nis now considered an article of luxury, owing to distance and\r\ndifficulties of transportation from manufacturing centers.\r\n\r\nA special delegation from Canada has been sent to Europe, to study and\r\nsubsequently report upon the true condition of the beet sugar\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nA correspondent writes from Farnham, Canada, that the Canadian\r\ngovernment grants a bounty of 2 cents per pound on beet sugar during\r\ncampaign 1891-92. Duties on raw sugar were abolished last June.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN WORKSHOPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting paper on some of the leading American workshops was\r\nlately read before the members of the Manchester Association of\r\nEngineers on Saturday by Mr. Hans Renold. After expressing his opinion\r\nthat the English people did not sufficiently look about them or try to\r\nunderstand what other nations were doing, Mr. Renold stated that he\r\nhad visited that portion of America known as New England, and the\r\nworks he had inspected were among the best in the United States. Among\r\nthe many special features he had noticed he mentioned that in a Boston\r\nestablishment where milling machine cutters were made he had found\r\nthat £1 spent in wages produced as much as £30 to £40 worth of goods,\r\nthe cutters being made at the rate of about sixty-four per hour by\r\nabout a dozen men. Another noticeable feature was the exceptional care\r\ntaken in storing tools in American workshops. These, in fact, were\r\ntreated as if they were worth their weight in gold; they were stored\r\nin safes much in the same manner as we in England stored our money. He\r\nwas, however, impressed by the fact that the mere understanding of the\r\nmethod of American working would not enable them to do likewise in\r\nEngland, because the American workmen had gone through a special\r\ntraining, and a similar training would be necessary to enable English\r\nworkmen to adapt themselves to American machines. One very noticeable\r\nfeature in American engineering shops which he visited was that all\r\nthe machine men and turners were seated on blocks or stools at their\r\nmachines, and the question naturally arose in his mind what would\r\nEnglish engineers say if such a practice were adopted in their shops.\r\nIn other ways he was also struck by the special attention devoted to\r\nthe comfort of the workmen, and he was much impressed by the healthy\r\ncondition of the emery polishing shops as compared with similar shops\r\nin this country. In England these shops in most cases were simply\r\ndeathtraps to the workmen, and he urged that the superior method of\r\nventilation carried out in the States should be adopted in this\r\ncountry by introducing a fan to each wheel to take away the particles,\r\netc., which were so injurious. One very special feature in the United\r\nStates was that works were devoted to the manufacture of one\r\nparticular article to an almost inconceivable extent, and that heavy\r\nmachine tools complete and ready to be dispatched were kept in stock\r\nin large numbers. American enterprise was not hampered as it too\r\nfrequently was in England by want of capital; while in England we were\r\nready to put our savings in South American railways or fictitious gold\r\nmines, but very chary about investing capital which would assist an\r\nengineer in bringing out an honest improvement, in America, on the\r\nother hand, it was a common practice among the best firms to invest\r\ntheir savings over and over again in their works, which were thus kept\r\nin a high state of perfection.\r\n\r\nThe above paper came in for some pretty severe criticism. Mr. John\r\nCraven remarked that although Mr. Renold had gone over a wide field of\r\nsubjects, he had practically confined his remarks to Messrs. Brown &\r\nSharpe's establishment, and while he (Mr. Craven) was ready to admit\r\nthat so far as high class work and sanitary arrangements were\r\nconcerned, Messrs. Brown & Sharpe's were a model, they could not be\r\nput forward as representative of American establishments generally. As\r\na matter of fact, many of the American workshops were not as good as a\r\nlarge number of similar workshops in Manchester. Mr. Renold had\r\nreferred to the extensive use of gear cutters in the United States,\r\nbut he might point out that it was in Manchester that the milling\r\nmachine was first made. Mr. Samuel Dixon said he had certainly come to\r\nthe conclusion that no better work was done in America than could be\r\nand was being done in this country; while as regards the enormous\r\nproduction of milling cutters, that was simply an example of what\r\ncould be done where large firms devoted themselves to the production\r\nof one specialty. With regard to the statement made by Mr. Renold that\r\nthe American thread was preferable to the Whitworth thread, he might\r\nsay he entirely disagreed with such a conclusion, and he might add\r\nthat after visiting a variety of Continental and American workshops he\r\nshould certainly not, if he were called upon to award the palm of\r\nsuperiority in workmanship, go across the Atlantic for that purpose.\r\nMr. J. Nasmith remarked that whether English engineers were the\r\ninventors of the milling machine or not, it must be admitted that it\r\nwas through this type of cutter being taken up by the Americans that\r\nmilling had become the success it was at the present time. English\r\nengineers were very conservative, and it was only through the pressure\r\nof circumstances that milling machines came into general use in this\r\ncountry. When American inventions were brought to England they were\r\ngenerally improved to the highest degree, but he thought the chief\r\nfault of both American and Continental engineers was what one might\r\ncall \"over-refinement;\" there was such a thing as over-finishing an\r\nobject and overdoing it. If, however, American machinery was so much\r\nsuperior to what we had in this country, as asserted by the reader of\r\nthe paper, how was it that cotton machinery, with all its intricacies,\r\ncould be sent to the United States, in the face of American\r\nmanufacturers, even though the cost was increased from 40 to 60 per\r\ncent.? At the present time it was possible for English machinists to\r\nsecure contracts for the whole of the machinery in an American mill,\r\nand inclusive of freight charges and high tariff, deliver and erect it\r\nin America at a lower cost than American engineers with all the\r\nadvantages of their immeasurably superior tools were able to do.\r\nAnother speaker, Mr. Barstow, ridiculed the idea that the Americans\r\ncould be so pre-eminent in the manufacture of emery wheels as might be\r\ninferred from Mr. Renold, when they had before them the fact that from\r\nthe neighborhood of Manchester thousands of emery wheels were every\r\nyear exported to the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN METHODS OF QUARRYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. L. Saunders, for many years the engineer of the Ingersoll Rock\r\nDrill Co., and hence thoroughly familiar with modern quarrying\r\npractice, read a paper before the last meeting of the American Society\r\nof Civil Engineers on the above subject, containing many interesting\r\npoints, given in the _Engineering News_, from which we abstract as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to describing the new Knox system of quarrying, which\r\neven yet is not universally known among quarrymen, Mr. Saunders gives\r\nthe following in regard to older methods:\r\n\r\n    The Knox system is a recent invention; no mention was made of\r\n    it in the tenth census, and no description has yet been given\r\n    of it in any publications on quarrying. The first work done by\r\n    this method was in 1885, and at the close of that year 2\r\n    quarries had adopted it. In 1886 it was used in 20 quarries;\r\n    in 1887 in 44, in 1888 in upward of 100, and at the present\r\n    time about 300 quarries have adopted it. Its purpose is to\r\n    release dimension stone from its place in the bed, by so\r\n    directing an explosive force that it is made to cleave the\r\n    rock in a prescribed line without injury. The system is also\r\n    used for breaking up detached blocks of stone into smaller\r\n    sizes.\r\n\r\nQuarrymen have, ever since the introduction of blasting, tried to\r\ndirect the blast so as to save stock. Holes drilled by hand are seldom\r\nround. The shape of the bit and their regular rotation while drilling\r\nusually produce a hole of somewhat triangular section. It was\r\nobserved, many years ago, that when a blast was fired in a\r\nhand-drilled hole the rock usually broke in three directions,\r\nradiating from the points of the triangle in the hole. This led\r\nquarrymen to look for a means by which the hole might be shaped in\r\naccordance with a prescribed direction of cleavage.\r\n\r\nThe oldest sandstone quarries in America are those at Portland, Conn.\r\nIt was from these quarries that great quantities of brownstone were\r\nshipped for buildings in New York. The typical \"brownstone front\" is\r\nall built of Portland stone. As the Portland quarries were carried to\r\ngreat depths the thickness of bed increased, as it usually does in\r\nquarries. With beds from 10 to 20 ft. deep, all of solid and valuable\r\nbrownstone, it became a matter of importance that some device should\r\nbe applied which would shear the stone from its bed without loss of\r\nstock and without the necessity of making artificial beds at short\r\ndistances. A system was adopted and used successfully for a number of\r\nyears which comprised the drilling of deep holes from 10 to 12 in. in\r\ndiameter, and charging them with explosives placed in a canister of\r\npeculiar shape. The drilling of this hole is so interesting as to\r\nwarrant a passing notice. The system was similar to that followed with\r\nthe old fashioned drop drill. The weight of the bit was the force\r\nwhich struck the blow, and this bit was simply raised or lowered by a\r\ncrank turned by two men at the wheel. The bit resembled a broad ax in\r\nshape, in that it was extremely broad, tapering to a sharp point, and\r\nconvex along the edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 illustrates in section one of the Portland drills, and a drill\r\nhole with the canister containing the explosive in place. The canister\r\nwas made of two curved pieces of sheet tin with soldered edges, cloth\r\nor paper being used at the ends. It was surrounded with sand or earth,\r\nso that the effect of the blast was practically the same as though the\r\nhole were drilled in the shape of the canister. In other words, the\r\nold Portland system was to drill a large, round hole, put in a\r\ncanister, and then fill up a good part of the hole. Were it possible\r\nto drill the hole in the shape of the canister, it would obviously\r\nsave a good deal of work which had to be undone. The Portland system\r\nwas, therefore, an extravagant one, but the results accomplished were\r\nsuch as to fully warrant its use. Straight and true breaks were made,\r\nfollowing the line of the longer axis of the canister section, as in\r\nFig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt was found that with the old Portland canister two breaks might be\r\nmade at right angles by a single blast, when using a canister shaped\r\nlike a square prism. In some of the larger blasts, where blocks\r\nweighing in the neighborhood of 2,000 tons were sheared on the bed,\r\ntwo holes as deep as 20 ft. were drilled close together. The core\r\nbetween the holes was then clipped out and large canisters measuring 2\r\nft. across from edge to edge were used.\r\n\r\nIn regard to another of the older systems of blasting, known as\r\nLewising, Mr. Saunders says:\r\n\r\n    A Lewis hole is made by drilling two or three holes close\r\n    together and parallel with each other, the partitions between\r\n    the holes being broken down by using what is known as a\r\n    broach. Thus a wide hole or groove is formed in which powder\r\n    is inserted, either by ramming it directly in the hole, or by\r\n    puling it in a canister, shaped somewhat like the Lewis hole\r\n    trench. A complex Lewis hole is the combination of 3 drill\r\n    holes, while a compound Lewis hole contains 4 holes. Lewising\r\n    is confined almost entirely to granite. In some cases a series\r\n    of Lewis holes is put in along the bench at distances of 10\r\n    and 25 ft. apart, or even greater, each Lewis hole being\r\n    situated equidistant from the face of the bench. The holes are\r\n    blasted simultaneously by the electric battery.\r\n\r\nAfter noting another system used to a limited extent, and not to be\r\ncommended, viz., the use of inverted plugs and feathers (the plugs and\r\nfeathers being inserted as a sort of tamping which the blast drives\r\nupward to split the rock), Mr. Saunders continues in substance as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    It is thus seen that the \"state of the art\" has been\r\n    progressive, though it was imperfect. Mr. Sperr, in his\r\n    reference to this subject, made in the report of the tenth\r\n    census, says: \"The influence of the shape of the drill hole\r\n    upon the effects of the blast does not seem to be generally\r\n    known, and a great waste of material necessarily follows.\"\r\n    This was written but a few years before the introduction of\r\n    the new system, and it is doubtless true that attention was\r\n    thus widely directed to the conspicuous waste, due to a lack\r\n    of knowledge of the influence of the shape of a drill hole on\r\n    the effect of a blast. The system developed by Mr. Knox\r\n    practically does all and more than was done by the old\r\n    Portland system, and it does it at far less expense. It can\r\n    best be described by illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is a round hole drilled either by hand or otherwise, preferably\r\notherwise, because an important point is to get it round. Fig. 4 is\r\nthe improved form of hole, and this is made by inserting a reamer,\r\nFigs. 5 and 6, into the hole in the line of the proposed fracture,\r\nthus cutting two V-shaped grooves into the walls of the hole. The\r\nblacksmith tools for dressing the reamers are shown in Fig. 7. The\r\nusual method of charging and tamping a hole in using the new system is\r\nshown in Fig. 8. The charge of powder is shown at C, the air space at\r\nB and the tamping at A. Fig. 9 is a special hole for use in thin beds\r\nof rock. The charge of powder is shown at C, the rod to sustain\r\ntamping at D, air space at BB, and tamping at A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7]\r\n\r\nLet us assume that we have a bluestone quarry, in which we may\r\nillustrate the simplest application of the new system. The sheet of\r\nstone which we wish to shear from place has a bed running horizontally\r\nat a depth of say 10 ft. One face is in front and a natural seam\r\ndivides the bed at each end at the walls of the quarry. We now have a\r\nblock of stone, say 50 ft. long, with all its faces free except\r\none--that opposite and corresponding with the bench. One or more of\r\nthe specially formed holes are put in at such depth and distance from\r\neach other and from the bench as may be regulated by the thickness,\r\nstrength and character of the rock. No man is so good a judge of this\r\nas the quarry foreman who has used and studied the effect of this\r\nsystem in his quarry. Great care should be taken to drill the holes\r\nround and in a straight line. In sandstone of medium hardness these\r\nholes may be situated 10, 12 or 15 ft. apart. If the bed is a tight\r\none the hole should be run entirely through the sheet and to the bed;\r\nbut with an open free bed holes of less depth will suffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8, 9]\r\n\r\nThe reamer should now be used and driven by hand. Several devices have\r\nbeen applied to rock drills for reaming the hole by machinery while\r\ndrilling; that is, efforts have been made to combine the drill and the\r\nreamer. Such efforts have met with only partial success. The perfect\r\nalignment of the reamer is so important that where power is used this\r\npoint is apt to be neglected. It is also a well known fact that the\r\nprocess of reaming by hand is not a difficult or a slow one. The\r\ndrilling of the hole requires the greatest amount of work. After this\r\nhas been done it is a simple matter to cut the V-shaped grooves. The\r\nreamer should be applied at the center, that is, the grooves should be\r\ncut on the axis or full diameter of the hole. The gauge of the reamer\r\nshould be at least 1½ diameters. Great care should be taken that the\r\nreamer does not twist, as the break may be thereby deflected; and the\r\nreaming must be done also to the full depth of the hole.\r\n\r\nThe hole is now ready for charging. The powder should be a low\r\nexplosive, like black or Judson powder or other explosives which act\r\nslowly. No definite rule can be laid down as to the amount of powder\r\nto be used, but it should be as small as possible. Very little powder\r\nis required in most rocks. Hard and fine grained stone requires less\r\npowder than soft stone. Mr. Knox tells of a case which came under his\r\nobservation, where a block of granite \"more than 400 tons weight,\r\nsplit clear in two with 13 oz. of FF powder.\" He compares this with a\r\nblock of sandstone of less than 100 tons weight \"barely started with\r\n2½ lb. of the same grade of powder, and requiring a second shot to\r\nremove it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that enough powder must be inserted in the hole to\r\nproduce a force sufficient to move the entire mass of rock on its bed.\r\nIn some kinds of stone, notably sandstone, the material is so soft\r\nthat it will break when acted upon by the force necessary to shear the\r\nblock. In cases of this kind a number of holes should be drilled and\r\nfired simultaneously by the electric battery. In such work it is usual\r\nto put in the holes only 4 or 5 ft. apart. The powder must, of course,\r\nbe provided with a fuse or preferably a fulminating cap. It is well to\r\ninsert the cap at or near the bottom of the cartridge, as shown in\r\nFigs. 8 and 9.\r\n\r\nAfter the charge the usual thing to do is to insert tamping. In the\r\nimproved form of hole the tamping should not he put directly upon the\r\npowder, but an air space should be left, as shown at B, Fig. 8. The\r\nbest way to tamp, leaving an air space, is first to insert a wad,\r\nwhich may be of oakum, hay, grass, paper or other similar material.\r\nThe tamping should be placed from 6 to 12 in. below the mouth of the\r\nhole. In some kinds of stone a less distance will suffice, and as much\r\nair space as practicable should intervene between the explosive and\r\nthe tamping. If several holes are used on a line they should be\r\nconnected in series and blasted by electricity. The effect of the\r\nblast is to make a vertical seam connecting the holes, and the entire\r\nmass of rock is sheared several inches or more.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of this new method of blasting is simple, though a\r\nmatter of some dispute. The following explanation has been given. See\r\nFig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10]\r\n\r\n\"The two surfaces, _a_ and _b_, being of equal area, must receive an\r\nequal amount of the force generated by the conversion of the explosive\r\ninto gas. These surfaces being smooth and presenting no angle between\r\nthe points, A and B, they furnish no starting point for a fracture,\r\nbut at these points the lines meet at a sharp angle including between\r\nthem a wedge-shaped space. The gas acting equally in all directions\r\nfrom the center is forced into the two opposite wedge-shaped spaces,\r\nand the impact being instantaneous the effect is precisely similar to\r\nthat of two solid wedges driven from the center by a force equally\r\nprompt and energetic. All rocks possess the property of elasticity in\r\na greater or less degree, and this principle being excited to the\r\npoint of rupture at the points, A and B, the gas enters the crack and\r\nthe rock is split in a straight line simply because under the\r\ncircumstances it cannot split in any other way.\"\r\n\r\nAnother theory which is much the same in substance is then given, and\r\nafter some general discussion of the theory of the action of the\r\nforces under the several systems, the paper continues:\r\n\r\nThe new form of hole is, therefore, almost identical in principle with\r\nthe old Portland canister, except that it has the greater advantage of\r\nthe V-shaped groove in the rock, which serves as a starting point for\r\nthe break. It is also more economical than the Portland canister, in\r\nthat it requires less drilling and the waste of stone is less. It is,\r\ntherefore, not only more economical than any other system of blasting,\r\nbut it is more certain, and in this respect it is vastly superior to\r\nany other blasting system, because stone is valuable, and anything\r\nwhich adds to the certainty of the break also adds to the profit of\r\nthe quarryman.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true that, notwithstanding the greater area of\r\npressure in the new form of hole, the break would not invariably\r\nfollow the prescribed line but for the V-shaped groove which virtually\r\nstarts it. A bolt, when strained, will break in the thread whether\r\nthis be the smallest section or not, because the thread is the\r\nstarting point for the break. A rod of glass is broken with a slight\r\njar provided a groove has been filed in its surface. Numerous other\r\ninstances might be cited to prove the value of the groove. Elasticity\r\nin rock is a pronounced feature, which varies to a greater or less\r\nextent; but it is always more or less present. A sandstone has\r\nrecently been found which possesses the property of elasticity to such\r\nan extent that it may be bent like a thin piece of steel. When a blast\r\nis made in the new form of hole the stone is under high tension, and\r\nbeing elastic it will naturally pull apart on such lines of weakness\r\nas grooves, especially when they are made, as is usually the case in\r\nthis system, in a direction at right angles with the lines of least\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nHorizontal holes are frequently put in and artificial beds made by\r\n\"lofting.\" In such cases where the rock has a \"rift\" parallel with the\r\nbed, one hole about half way through is sufficient for a block about\r\n15 ft. square, but in \"liver\" rock the holes must be drilled nearly\r\nthrough the block and the size of the block first reduced.\r\n\r\nA more difficult application of the system, and one requiring greater\r\ncare in its successful use, is where the block of stone is so situated\r\nthat both ends are not free, one of them being solidly fixed in the\r\nquarry wall. A simple illustration of a case of this kind is a stone\r\nstep on a stairway which leads up and along a wall, Fig. 11. Each step\r\nhas one end fixed to the wall and the other free. Each step is also\r\nfree on top, on the bottom and on the face, but fixed at the back. We\r\nnow put one of the new form of holes in the corner at the junction of\r\nthe step and the wall. The shape of the hole is as shown in Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nIt is here seen that the grooves are at right angles with each other,\r\nand the block of stone is sheared by a break made opposite and\r\nparallel with the bench, as in the previous case, and an additional\r\nbreak made at right angles with the bench and at the fixed end of the\r\nblock. Sometimes a corner break is made by putting in two of the\r\nregular V-shaped holes in the lines of the proposed break and without\r\nthe use of the corner hole. A useful application of this system is in\r\nsplitting up large masses of loose stone. For this purpose the\r\nV-shaped grooves are sometimes cut in four positions and breaks are\r\nmade in four directions radiating from the center of the hole as shown\r\nin Fig. 12. In this way a block is divided into four rectangular\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nThough the new system is especially adapted to the removal of heavy\r\nmasses of rock, yet it has been applied with success in cases where\r\nseveral light beds overlie each other. In one such instance 10 sheets,\r\nmeasuring in all only 6 ft., were broken by a blast, but in cases of\r\nthis kind the plug and feather process applies very well, and the new\r\nsystem, when used, must be in the hands of an expert, or the loss will\r\nbe serious.\r\n\r\nReferring again to our stone step, let us imagine a case where this\r\nstairway runs between two walls. We have here each step fixed at each\r\nend and free only on the top, the bottom, and one face. Let us assume\r\nthat there is a back seam, that is, that the step is not fixed at the\r\nback. In a quarry, this seam, unless a natural one, should be made by\r\na channeling machine. In order to throw this step put of place it must\r\nbe cut off at both ends, and for this purpose the V-shaped holes are\r\nput in at right angles to the face. It is well, however, to put the\r\nfirst two holes next the back seam in a position where the grooves\r\nwill converge at the back so as to form a sort of key, which serves a\r\nuseful purpose in removing the block after the blast. In quarries\r\nwhere there are no horizontal beds a channeling machine should be used\r\nto free the block on all sides and to a suitable depth, and then the\r\nledge may be \"lofted\" by holes placed horizontally.\r\n\r\nWhere \"pressure\" exists in quarries, the new system has certain\r\nlimitations. After determining the line of \"pressure\" it is only\r\npracticable to use the system directly on the line of thrust, or at\r\nright angles to it. It is much better, however, to release the\r\n\"pressure\" from the ledge by channeling, after which a single end may\r\nbe detached by a Knox blast. It is well to bear in mind that the holes\r\nshould invariably be of small diameter. In no case should the diameter\r\nof a hole be over 1½ in. in any kind of rock. This being the case, the\r\nblocks of stone are delivered to the market with but little loss in\r\nmeasurement. It is a noticeable fact that stone quarried by the new\r\nsystem shows very little evidence of drill marks, for the faces are\r\nfrequently as true as though cut with a machine.\r\n\r\nA further gain is the safety of the system. The blasting is light and\r\nis confined entirely within the holes. No spalls or fragments are\r\nthrown from the bast.\r\n\r\nThe popular idea that the system is antagonistic to the channeling\r\nprocess is a mistaken one. There are, of course, some quarries which\r\nformerly used channeling machines without this system, but which now\r\ndo a large part of the work by blasting. Instances, however, are rare\r\nwhere the system has replaced the channeler. The two go side by side,\r\nand an intelligent use of the new system in most quarries requires a\r\nchanneling machine. There are those who may tell of stone that has\r\nbeen destroyed by a blast on the new system, but investigation usually\r\nshows that either the work was done by an inexperienced operator, or\r\nan effort was made to do too much.\r\n\r\nA most interesting illustration of the value of this system, side by\r\nside with the channeler, is shown in the northern Ohio sandstone\r\nquarries. A great many channeling machines are in use there, working\r\naround the new form of holes, and when used together in an intelligent\r\nand careful manner, the stone is quarried more cheaply than by any\r\nother process that has yet been devised.\r\n\r\nTo a limited extent the system has been used in slate. The difficulty\r\nis that most of the slate quarries are in solid ledges, where no free\r\nfaces or beds exist; but it has been used with success in a slate\r\nquarry at Cherryville, Pa., since 1888. Among notable blasts made by\r\nthis system are the following: At the mica schist quarries, at\r\nConshohocken, Pa., a hole 1½ in. in diameter was drilled in a block\r\nwhich was 27 ft. long, 15 ft. wide and 6 ft. thick. The blast broke\r\nthe stone across the \"rift,\" only 8 oz. of black powder being used. At\r\nthe Portland, Conn., quarries a single blast was fired by electricity,\r\n15 holes being drilled with 2 lb. of coarse No. C powder in each hole,\r\nand a rock was removed 110 ft. long, 20 ft. wide and 11 ft. thick,\r\ncontaining 24,200 cu. ft., or about 2,400 tons, the fracture being\r\nperfectly straight. This large mass of stone was moved out about 2 in.\r\nwithout injury to itself or the adjoining rock.\r\n\r\nAnother blast at Portland removed 3,300 tons a distance of 4 in.\r\nSeventeen holes were drilled, using 2 lb. of powder in each hole, the\r\nsize of the block being 150 × 20 × 11 ft. In a Lisbon, O., quarry a\r\nblock of sandstone 200 ft. long, 28 ft. wide and 15 ft. thick was\r\nmoved about ½ in. by a blast. This block was also afterward cut up by\r\nthis system in blocks 6 ft. square. A sandstone bowlder 70 ft. long,\r\naverage width 50 ft., average thickness 13 ft., was embedded in the\r\nground to a depth of about 7 ft. A single hole 8 ft. deep was charged\r\nwith 20 oz. of powder and the rock was split in a straight line from\r\nend to end and entirely to the bottom. A ledge of sandstone open on\r\nits face and two ends, 110 × 13 × 8 ft., was moved by a blast about 3\r\nin. without wasting a particle of rock, 8 holes being used, drilled by\r\nthree men in just one day, and 15 oz. of powder being used in each\r\nhole. A sandstone ledge, open on the face and end only, 200 × 28 × 15\r\nft., containing 84,000 cu. ft. stone, was moved ½ in. by 25 holes,\r\neach containing 1 lb. of powder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TROTTER CURVE RANGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little instrument was exhibited in a somewhat crude state at the\r\nmeeting of the British Association at Newcastle in 1889. It has since\r\nbeen modified in several respects, and improvements suggested by\r\npractical use have been introduced, bringing it into a practical form,\r\nand enabling a much greater accuracy to be attained. The principle is\r\none which is occasionally employed for setting out circles with a\r\npocket sextant, viz., the property of a circle that the angle in a\r\nsegment is constant. The leading feature of the invention is the\r\narrangement of scales, which enables the operation of setting put\r\nlarge curves for railway or other work to be carried out without\r\nrequiring any calculations, thereby enabling any intelligent man to\r\nexecute work which would otherwise call for a knowledge of the use of\r\na theodolite and the tables of tangential angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1--PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF INSTRUMENT MOUNTED ON A\r\nSTAFF.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument is intended to be thoroughly portable; so much so,\r\nindeed, that it is not necessary or even desirable to use a tripod. It\r\nmay be held in the hand like a sextant, or may be carried on a light\r\nstaff. The general appearance is shown in Fig. 1. It will be seen that\r\na metal plate, on which two scales are engraved, carries a mirror at\r\none end and an eye piece at the other. The mirror is mounted on a\r\nmetal plate, which is shaped to a peculiar curve. A clamp and slow\r\nmotion provide for rapid and for fine adjustment. The eye piece is set\r\nat an angle, and contains a half silvered mirror, the upper portion\r\nbeing transparent. This allows direct vision along the axis of the eye\r\npiece, and at the same time vision in another direction, after two\r\nreflections, one in the eye piece and the other at the adjustable\r\nmirror. Fig. 2 is an outline plan of the instrument when closed. In\r\nthe first form of the instrument only one mirror was provided, but by\r\nthe double reflection in the improved pattern, any accidental twisting\r\nof the rod or handle produces no displacement of the images, since the\r\ninclination of one mirror neutralizes the equal and opposite\r\ninclination of the other. No cross line is required with the new\r\narrangement, since it is only necessary that the two images should\r\ncoincide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--OUTLINE OF INSTRUMENT SHOWING THE PATH OF THE\r\nDIRECT AND OF THE REFLECTED RAY.]\r\n\r\nThe dotted line A B represents the direct ray, and the line A C D the\r\nreflected one. Fig. 3 shows the different geometrical and\r\ntrigonometrical elements of the curve, which can be read upon the\r\nvarious scales, or to which the instrument may be set. An observer\r\nstanding at C sights the point B directly and the point A by\r\nreflection. A staff being set up at each point, he will see them\r\nsimultaneously, and in coincidence if the instrument be properly set\r\nfor the curve. If any intermediate position be taken up on the curve,\r\nboth A and B will be seen in coincidence. If the two rods do not\r\nappear superimposed, the operator must move to the right or the left\r\nuntil this is the case. The instrument will then be over a point in\r\nthe curve. Any number of points at any regular or irregular distances\r\nalong the curve can thus be set out. One of the simplest elements\r\nwhich can be taken as a datum is the ratio of the length of the chord\r\nto the radius, AB/AO, Fig. 3. This being given, the value of the ratio\r\nis found on the straight scale on the body of the instrument, and the\r\ncurved plate is moved until the beveled edge cuts the scale at the\r\ndesired point. The figure of this curve is a polar curve, whose\r\nequation is _r_ = _a_ ± _b_ sin. 2 [theta], where _a_ is the distance\r\nfrom the zero graduation to the axis of the mirror, and _b_ is the\r\nlength of the scale from zero to 2, and [theta] is the inclination of\r\nthe mirror. In the perspective view, Fig. 1, the curved edge cuts the\r\nscale at 1. The instrument being thus set, the following elements may\r\nbe read either directly on the scales or by simple arithmetical\r\ncalculation:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\r\n\r\n    The radius = 1.\r\n\r\n    AB, the chord, read direct on the straight scale.\r\n\r\n    AFB, the length of the arc, read direct on the back or under\r\n    surface of the plate.\r\n\r\n    FH, the versed sine, read direct on the curved scale.\r\n\r\n    ACB, the angle in the segment, read direct on the graduated\r\n    edge.\r\n\r\n    EAB, the angle between the chord and the tangent, read direct\r\n    on the graduated edge.\r\n\r\n    GAB, the tangential angle = 180 deg. - ACB.\r\n\r\n    AOB, the angle at the center = 2GAB.\r\n\r\n    AGB, the angle between the tangents = 180 deg. - AOB.\r\n\r\n    OAB, the angle between the chord and the radius = EAB - 90\r\n    deg.\r\n\r\n               AH_{2}\r\n        GF = --------- - FH.\r\n                HO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing elements are contained in a very simple diagram, Fig. 4,\r\nwhich is engraved on the instrument, together with the following\r\nreferences:\r\n\r\n        B = 180 deg. - A.\r\n        C = 2B.\r\n        D = 180 deg. - C.\r\n        E = A - 90.\r\n\r\nOnly one adjustment is necessary, and this is provided by means of the\r\nscrews which fix the inclination of the eyepiece. This is set at such\r\nan angle that the instrument, when closed and reading 90° on the\r\ndivided limb, acts as an optical square.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, as in the ordinary method with a theodolite, that\r\none end of the curve should be visible from the other. If an obstacle\r\nintervenes, all that part of the curve which commands a view of both\r\nends can be set out, and a ranging rod can be set up at any point of\r\nthe curve so found, and the instrument may be reset to complete the\r\ncurve.\r\n\r\nTo set out a tangent to the curve at A, Fig. 3, set up a rod at A and\r\nanother at any point C, and take up a position on the curve at some\r\npoint between them. Adjust the mirror until the rods are seen\r\nsuperimposed. Then moving back to A, observe C direct, and set up a\r\nrod at E in the line observed by reflection. Then A E is the tangent\r\nrequired. Similarly, on completing the setting out of a curve, and\r\narriving at the end of the chord, the remote end being seen by\r\nreflection, the direction observed along the axis of the eyepiece is\r\nthe new tangent.\r\n\r\nAny of the angles or other ratios already mentioned may be used for\r\nsetting the instrument, but if no data whatever are given, as in the\r\nrough surveys for colonial railways where no previous surveys exist,\r\nit is only necessary to select points through which the curve must\r\npass, to set up ranging rods either at the extremities of the desired\r\ncurve, or at any points thereon, to take up a position on the desired\r\ncurve between two rods, and to adjust the instrument until they are\r\nseen in coincidence. The curve can then be set out, and fully marked,\r\nand the elements of the curve can be read on the scales and recorded\r\nfor reference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--DIAGRAM ENGRAVED ON THE INSTRUMENT.]\r\n\r\nVarious other cases which may occur in practice can be rapidly met by\r\none or other of the various scales. Suppose the angle A G B between\r\nthe tangents be given, together with the middle point F on the curve,\r\nFig. 3. Subtract this angle from 180 deg., the difference gives the\r\nangle at the center A O B. Take half this, and set the instrument to\r\nthe angle thus found. Walk along the tangent until a rod set up at\r\nsome point in the tangent, say E, is seen in coincidence with a rod\r\nset up at B. The position of the instrument then marks the point of\r\ndeparture A. A rod being placed at A, the first half of the curve may\r\nbe set out; or, if B is invisible, the instrument may be reset for the\r\nangle E A B, and the whole curve set out up to B. No cutting of hedges\r\nis necessary, as with theodolite work, for a curve can easily be taken\r\npiece by piece. Inclination of the whole instrument introduces no\r\nappreciable error. If the eye piece be pointed up or down hill, the\r\ninstrument is thrown a little to one side or other of the tip of the\r\nstaff, but in a plane tangent to the circle. Errors made in setting\r\nout a curve with the Trotter curve ranger are not cumulative, as in\r\nthe method of tangential angles with a theodolite. No corrections for\r\ninaccurate hitting of the final rod can occur, for the curve must\r\nnecessarily end at that point. It should be observed that the\r\ninstrument is not intended to supersede a theodolite, but it has the\r\ngreat advantage over the older instrument that no assistant or chains\r\nor trigonometrical tables or any knowledge of mathematics are\r\nrequired. The data being given, by a theodolite or otherwise, an\r\nintelligent platelayer can easily set out the curve, while the trained\r\nengineer proceeds in advance with the theodolite. No time is lost; as\r\nin chaining, since the marks may be made wherever and as often as\r\nconvenient. In work where high accuracy is required this instrument is\r\nwell adapted for filling in, and where a rough idea of the nature of a\r\ngiven curve is required, the mirror being adjusted for any three\r\npoints upon it, the various elements may be read off on the scales. A\r\ntelescope is provided, but the errors not being cumulative, it is\r\nrarely required. The curve ranger weighs 1 lb. 10 oz., and is\r\nmanufactured by Messrs. Elliott Bros., St. Martin's Lane, London. It\r\nis the invention of Mr. Alex. P. Trotter, Westminster.--_The\r\nEngineer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAIL SPIKE AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Abstract from the History of the Camden and Amboy\r\n  Railroad. By J. Elfreth Watkins, of the National Museum,\r\n  Washington, D.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in October, 1830, and shortly after the surveys of the Camden\r\nand Amboy Railroad were completed, Robert L. Stevens (born 1787)\r\nsailed for England, with instructions to order a locomotive and rails\r\nfor that road.\r\n\r\nAt that time no rolling mill in America was able to take a contract\r\nfor rolling T rails.\r\n\r\nRobert Stevens advocated the use of an all-iron rail in preference to\r\nthe wooden rail or stone stringer plated with strap iron, then in use\r\non one or two short American railroads. At his suggestion, at the last\r\nmeeting held before he sailed, after due discussion, the Board of\r\nDirectors of the Camden and Amboy Railroad passed a special resolution\r\nauthorizing him to obtain the rails he advocated.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT L. STEVENS INVENTS THE AMERICAN RAIL AND SPIKE.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage to Liverpool he whiled away the hours on shipboard\r\nby whittling thin wood into shapes of imaginary cross sections until\r\nhe finally decided which one was best suited to the needs of the new\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nHe was familiar with the Berkenshaw rail, with which the best English\r\nroads were then being laid, but he saw that, as it required an\r\nexpensive chair to hold it in place, it was not adapted to our\r\ncountry, where metal workers were scarce and iron was dear. He added\r\nthe base to the T rail, dispensing with the chair. He also designed\r\nthe \"hook-headed\" spike (which is substantially the railroad spike of\r\nto-day) and the \"iron tongue\" (which has been developed into the fish\r\nbar), and the rivets (which have been replaced by the bolt and nut) to\r\ncomplete the joint.\r\n\r\nA fac-simile of the letter[2] which he addressed to the English iron\r\nmasters a short time after his arrival in London is preserved in the\r\nUnited States National Museum. It contains a cross section, side\r\nelevation and ground plan of the rail for which he requested bids.\r\n\r\nThe base of the rail which he first proposed was to be wider where it\r\nwas to be attached to the supports than in the intervening spaces.\r\nThis was afterward modified, so that the base was made the same width\r\n(three inches) throughout.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: This letter reads:\r\n\r\n    LIVERPOOL, November 26th, 1830.\r\n\r\n    GENTLEMEN,--At what rate will you contract to deliver at\r\n    Liverpool, say from 500 to 600 tons of railway, of the best\r\n    quality of iron rolled to the above pattern in 12 or 16 feet\r\n    lengths, to lap as shown in the drawing, with one hole at each\r\n    end, and the projections on the lower flange at every two\r\n    feet, cash on delivery?\r\n\r\n    How soon could you make the first delivery, and at what rate\r\n    per month until the whole is complete? Should the terms suit\r\n    and the work give satisfaction a more extended order is likely\r\n    to follow, as this is but about one-sixth part of the quantity\r\n    required. Please to address your answer (as soon as\r\n    convenient) to the care of Francis B. Ogden, Consul of the\r\n    United States at Liverpool.\r\n\r\n               I am\r\n                        Your obedient servant,\r\n                        ROBERT L. STEVENS,\r\n                        _President and Engineer of the Camden and\r\n                        South Amboy Railroad and Transportation Company._ ]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTY OF ROLLING THE AMERICAN RAIL.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens received no favorable answer to his proposals, but being\r\nacquainted with Mr. Guest (afterward Sir John Guest), a member of\r\nParliament, proprietor of large iron works in Dowlais, Wales, he\r\nprevailed upon him to have rails rolled at his works. Mr. Guest became\r\ninterested in the matter and accompanied Mr. Stevens to Wales, where\r\nthe latter gave his personal supervision to the construction of the\r\nrolls. After the rolls were completed the Messrs. Guest hesitated to\r\nhave them used, through fear of damage to the mill machinery, upon\r\nhearing which Mr. Stevens deposited a handsome sum guaranteeing the\r\nexpense of repairing the mill in case it was damaged. The receipt for\r\nthis deposit was preserved for many years among the archives of the\r\nCamden and Amboy Company. As a matter of fact, the rolling apparatus\r\ndid break down several times. \"At first,\" as Mr. Stevens in a letter\r\nto his father, which I have seen, described it, \"the rails came from\r\nthe rolls twisted and as crooked as snakes,\" and he was greatly\r\ndiscouraged. At last, however, the mill men acquired the art of\r\nstraightening the rail while it cooled.\r\n\r\nThe first shipment,[3] consisting of five hundred and fifty bars\r\neighteen feet long, thirty-six pounds to the yard, arrived in\r\nPhiladelphia on the ship Charlemagne, May 16, 1831.\r\n\r\nOver thirty miles of this rail was laid before the summer of 1832.\r\n\r\nA few years after, on much of the Stevens rail laid on the Camden and\r\nAmboy Railroad, the rivets at the joints were discarded, and the bolt\r\nwith the screw thread and nut, similar to that now used, was adopted\r\nas the standard.\r\n\r\nThe rail was first designed to weigh thirty-six pounds per yard, but\r\nit was almost immediately increased in weight to between forty and\r\nforty-two pounds, and rolled in lengths of sixteen feet. It was then\r\nthree and a half inches high, two and one-eighth inches wide on the\r\nhead and three and a half inches wide at the base, the price paid in\r\nEngland being £8 per ton. The import duty was $1.85.\r\n\r\nThe first shipment of rail, having arrived in America, was transported\r\nto Bordentown, and here, upon the ground on which we stand, and which\r\nthis monument is erected to mark forever, was laid the first piece of\r\ntrack (about five-sixths of a mile long) in August, 1831. The Camden\r\nand Amboy Company, following the example of the Manchester and\r\nLiverpool Railroad, laid their first track upon stone blocks two feet\r\nsquare and ten to thirteen inches deep. These blocks were purchased\r\nfrom the prison authorities at Sing Sing, N.Y. Some of these stone\r\nblocks have been used in constructing the foundation for this\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 3: A list of the vessels chartered to transport the rails,\r\n   with dates, tonnage, etc., is given below:\r\n\r\n                                    No. of        Tonnage.

Some of this rail is still in use in side\r\n  tracks. It is pronounced equal in durability to much of the steel\r\n  rail of to-day. ]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST JOINT FIXTURES.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens ordered the first joint fixtures also from an English\r\nmill, at the same time. The ends of the rails were designed to rest\r\nupon wrought iron plates or flat cast plates. The rails were connected\r\nat the stems by an iron \"tongue\" five inches long, two inches wide,\r\nand five-eighths of an inch thick. A rivet, put on hot, passing\r\nthrough the stem of each rail near the ends of the bar, fastened it to\r\nthe tongue and completed the joint. A hole oblong in shape, to allow\r\nfor expunctral contraction, was punched in the stem at each end of the\r\nrail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST RAILROAD SPIKES.\r\n\r\nThe first \"spikes six inches long, with hooked heads,\" were also\r\nordered at the same time. These were undoubtedly the \"first railroad\r\nspikes\" (as they are known to the trade) ever manufactured.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens neglected to obtain a patent for these inventions,\r\nalthough urged to do so by Mr. Ogden, American Consul at Liverpool,\r\nand the credit of being the inventor of the American rail was for a\r\ntime claimed for others, but the evidence brought forward in late\r\nyears fully established the fact that he was the originator of the\r\nAmerican system of railway construction.\r\n\r\nThe \"Stevens rail and spike\" gradually found great favor everywhere in\r\nAmerica--all the roads being relaid with it as the original T or strap\r\nrail became worn out.\r\n\r\nIn England the T rail still continues to be used. The London and\r\nBirmingham Railway, opened in 1838, was laid with Berkenshaw rails;\r\npart with the straight and part with the fish-bellied rail, and the\r\nremainder with reversible \"bull-headed\" rail, both types being\r\nsupported by chairs.[4]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 4: The experiment of laying the Stevens rail in chairs\r\n  was tried on the Albany and Schenectady road in 1837, on the\r\n  Hudson River Railroad 1848, but the chairs were soon afterward\r\n  discarded, nothing but spikes being used to attach the rail to the\r\n  tie.]\r\n\r\nSixty years have elapsed since this rail was adopted by the Camden and\r\nAmboy Company, and with the exception of slight alterations in the\r\nproportions incident to increased weight, no radical change has been\r\nmade in the \"Stevens rail,\" which is now in use on every railroad in\r\nAmerica. Many improvements have been made in the joint fixture, but\r\nthe \"tongue\" or fish plate improved into the angle splice bar is in\r\ngeneral use, and nothing has yet been found to take the place of the\r\n\"hook-headed\" railroad spike which Robert Stevens then designed.\r\n\r\nThe track upon which we stand was the first in the world that was laid\r\nwith the rail and spike now in general use.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. STEVENS EXAMINES ENGLISH LOCOMOTIVES.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens divided his time while abroad between arranging for the\r\nmanufacture of track material and examining the English locomotives\r\nthat were being constructed or had been in service.\r\n\r\nA year had elapsed since the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nRailway, and the English mechanics had not been idle. The \"Rocket,\"\r\nalthough successful in the Rainhill contest, when put to work had\r\nshown many defects that Stephenson & Co. were striving to correct in\r\nsubsequent locomotives.\r\n\r\nThe \"Planet,\" built by that firm, was tried in public December 4,\r\n1830, shortly after Mr. Stevens arrived in England, and at that time\r\nwas undoubtedly the best locomotive in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"JOHN BULL\" ORDERED.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens was present at a trial when the \"Planet\" showed most\r\nsatisfactory properties, and he at once ordered a locomotive of\r\nsimilar construction, from the same manufacturers, for the Camden and\r\nAmboy Railroad. This engine, afterward called the \"John Bull\" and \"No.\r\n1,\" was completed in May and shipped by sailing vessel from\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne in June, 1831, arriving in Philadelphia about the\r\nmiddle of August of that year. It was then transferred to a sloop at\r\nChestnut Street wharf, Philadelphia, whence it was taken to\r\nBordentown.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"JOHN BULL\" ARRIVES AT BORDENTOWN.\r\n\r\nThe following circumstances connected with the arrival of the engine\r\nat Bordentown, N.J., are related by Isaac Dripps, Esq., for many years\r\nmaster mechanic of the Camden and Am boy Railroad, and afterward\r\nsuperintendent of motive power of the Pennsylvania Railroad, who is\r\nnow, after a busy life, enjoying a peaceable retirement at his\r\npleasant home in West Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMr. Dripps, who is now in the eighty-second year of his age, was\r\nemployed by Robert and Edwin Stevens in repairing and assisting with\r\ntheir steamboats on the Delaware River and at Hoboken as early as\r\n1829. When the \"John Bull\" arrived in Philadelphia he was detailed by\r\nRobert Stevens to attend to the transportation of the engine to\r\nBordentown, where it was landed safely the last week in August, 1831.\r\n\r\nThe boiler and cylinders were in place, but the loose parts--rods,\r\npistons, valves, etc.--were packed in boxes. No drawings or directions\r\nfor putting the engine together had come to hand, and young Dripps,\r\nwho had never seen a locomotive, found great difficulty in discovering\r\nhow to put the parts in place, alone and unassisted, as Robert\r\nStevens, who had returned from Europe, was absent at Hoboken at the\r\ntime attending to other matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS OF ENGINE AND PARTS.\r\n\r\nThe bronze bass-relief upon the monument, made from the working\r\ndrawing furnished by Mr. Dripps, is an exact representation of the\r\nlocomotive when it arrived in America.\r\n\r\nThe engine originally weighed about ten tons. The boiler was thirteen\r\nfeet long and three feet six inches in diameter. The cylinders were\r\nnine inches by twenty inches. There were four driving wheels, four\r\nfeet six inches in diameter, arranged with outside cranks for\r\nconnecting parallel rods, but owing to the sharp curves on the road\r\nthese rods were never used. The driving wheels were made with cast\r\niron hubs and wooden (locust) spokes and felloes. The tires were of\r\nwrought iron, three quarters of an inch thick, the tread being five\r\ninches and the depth of flange one and a half inches. The gauge was\r\noriginally five feet from center to center of rails. The boiler was\r\ncomposed of sixty-two flues seven feet six inches long, two inches in\r\ndiameter; the furnace was three feet seven inches long and three feet\r\ntwo inches high, for burning wood. The steam ports were one and\r\none-eighth inches by six and a half inches; the exhaust ports one and\r\none-eighth by six and a half inches; grate surface, ten feet eight\r\ninches; fire box surface, thirty-six feet; flue surface, two hundred\r\nand thirteen feet; weight, without fuel or water, twenty-two thousand\r\nfour hundred and twenty-five pounds.\r\n\r\nAfter the valves were in gear and the engine in motion, two levers on\r\nthe engineman's side moved back and forth continuously. When it was\r\nnecessary to put the locomotive on the turntable, enginemen who were\r\nskilled in the handling of the engines first put the valves out of\r\ngear by turning the handle down, and then worked the levers by hand,\r\nthus moving the valves to the proper position and stopping the engine\r\nat the exact point desired.\r\n\r\nThe reversing gear was a very complicated affair. The two eccentrics\r\nwere secured to a sleeve or barrel, which fitted loosely on the crank\r\nshaft, between the two cranks, so as to turn freely. A treadle was\r\nused to change the position of this loose eccentric sleeve on the\r\nshaft of the driving wheel (moving it to the right or left) when it\r\nwas necessary to reverse. Two carriers were secured firmly to the body\r\nof this shaft (one on each side of the eccentrics); one carrier worked\r\nthe engine ahead, the other back. The small handle on the right side\r\nof the boiler was used to lift the eccentric rod (which passed forward\r\nto the rock shaft on the forward part of the engine) off the pin, and\r\nthus put the valves out of gear before it was possible to shift the\r\nsleeve and reverse the engine.\r\n\r\nGreat similarity will be noticed in the American locomotives built for\r\nmany years after the arrival of the \"John Bull,\" especially in the\r\nmatter of making the keys, brasses, etc., on the connecting rods, and\r\nin the construction of valves, fire box and tubes. Even the old plan\r\nof setting the ends of the exhaust nozzle high up in the smoke box,\r\nwhich was discontinued when the petticoat pipe came in use, is now\r\nagain resorted to in connection with the extended smoke box of modern\r\nlocomotives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST TRIAL OF THE LOCOMOTIVE.\r\n\r\nMr. Dripps informs me that, after many attempts, he succeeded in\r\nputting the parts of the engine together, and when it was placed in\r\nposition upon the track he notified Robert Stevens of the fact. Mr.\r\nStevens came at once to Bordentown, as his anxiety to see it in\r\noperation was very great. Upon his arrival the boiler was pumped full\r\nof water, by hand, from the hogshead in which it was brought. Benjamin\r\nHiggins made the fire with pine wood, and when the scale[5] showed\r\nthirty pounds steam pressure, Isaac Dripps opened the throttle, Robert\r\nStevens standing by his side, and the first locomotive on this great\r\nhighway _moved_. It would be difficult to describe the feeling of\r\nthese three men as they stood upon the moving engine--the first human\r\nfreight drawn by steam on what was afterward destined to be the great\r\nhighway connecting the two most populous cities of the American\r\ncontinent; a most important link in the chain of intercommunication\r\nbetween the North and South and West. What possibilities must have\r\ndawned upon them if they cared to lift the veil of the future!\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 5: The dial gauge was not in use at that time.]\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days after this preliminary trial the engine was\r\nagain taken apart, and as a few of the parts needed modification some\r\ntime intervened before it was again in running order. It will be\r\nremembered that young Dripps had never seen a locomotive before and\r\nthere were no \"old engineers\" to consult in regard to the construction\r\nor management of the engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TENDER IMPROVISED.\r\n\r\nAs no tender came with the locomotive, one was improvised from a\r\nfour-wheel flat car that had been used on construction work, which was\r\nsoon equipped to carry water and wood. The water tank consisted of a\r\nlarge whisky cask which was procured from a Bordentown storekeeper,\r\nand this was securely fastened on the center of this four-wheeled car.\r\nA hole was bored up through the car into the barrel and into it a\r\npiece of two-inch tin pipe was fastened, projecting below the platform\r\nof the car. It now became necessary to devise some plan to get the\r\nwater from the tank to the pump and into the boiler around the turns\r\nunder the cars, and as a series of rigid sections of pipe was not\r\npracticable, young Dripps procured four sections of hose two feet\r\nlong, which he had made out of shoe leather by a Bordentown shoemaker.\r\nThese were attached to the pipes and securely fastened by bands of\r\nwaxed thread. The hogshead was filled with water, a supply of wood for\r\nfuel was obtained, and the engine and tender were ready for work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAM OR HORSE POWER?\r\n\r\nAt that time the question whether the railroad should be operated by\r\nsteam locomotives or horse power had already become a political issue.\r\nThe farmers and other horse owners and dealers, who had made money by\r\nselling hay and grain and horses to the stage and freight wagon lines,\r\nwere discussing the possibilities of loss of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF THE ENGINE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nMany of the members of the New Jersey Legislature were farmers. The\r\nmanagement of the Camden and Amboy Railroad was anxious to give these\r\ngentlemen and other prominent citizens an opportunity to examine a\r\nsteam locomotive at work and to ride in a railway train.\r\n\r\nSixty years ago to-day, on the 12th of November, 1831, by special\r\ninvitation, the members of the Legislature and other State officials\r\nwere driven from Trenton to Bordentown in stages to witness the trial.\r\nAmong them were John P. Jackson (father of the present general\r\nsuperintendent of the United Railroads of New Jersey division of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, who afterward took a prominent part in the\r\naffairs of the New Jersey Railroad, whose termini were at New\r\nBrunswick and Jersey City); Benjamin Fish (director for fifty years\r\nfor the Camden and Amboy Railroad), afterward president of the\r\nFreehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad; Ashbel Welch, chief\r\nengineer and superintendent of the Belvidere and Delaware Railroad for\r\nmany years, and president of the United Railroads of New Jersey during\r\nthe years immediately preceding the lease to the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad; Edwin A. and Robert L. Stevens, afterward managers of the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST CARS.\r\n\r\nTwo coaches built so that they might be drawn by horses were attached\r\nto the locomotive. These coaches were of the English pattern. They had\r\nfour wheels and resembled three carriage bodies joined together, with\r\nseats in each facing each other. There were three doors at each side.\r\nThese cars were made by a firm of carriage manufacturers, M.P. and\r\nM.E. Green, of Hoboken, and were thought to be very handsome. The New\r\nJersey law makers were somewhat dubious, it is said, about risking\r\ntheir lives in this novel train, but at last they concluded to do so\r\nand the train started and made many trips back and forth without\r\naccident or delay. Madam Murat, wife of Prince Murat, a nephew of\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte, who was then living in Bordentown, insisted on\r\nbeing the first woman to ride on a train hauled by a steam locomotive\r\nin the State.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a grand entertainment was given to the Legislature by\r\nthe railroad company at Arnell's Hotel, Bordentown, and it has been\r\nwhispered that the festivities kept up until a late hour in the night.\r\nWhether that be true or not, it is generally conceded that from that\r\ntime to this the Legislature of New Jersey have always been more or\r\nless interested in the affairs of the Camden and Amboy Railroad and\r\nits successors, or _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThis first movement of passengers by steam in the State of New Jersey\r\nwas regarded as a success from every point of view, and in\r\ncommemoration of the important events here enacted the boundaries of\r\nthis first piece of railway laid between New York and Philadelphia,\r\nwhich were identified and staked out by Isaac Dripps a half century\r\nafterward, have been definitely marked for all time by the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company, who have erected these handsome stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest troubles of the young engineer and his employer,\r\nRobert L. Stevens, was the fact that as there were only four wheels\r\nunder the engines, they were derailed frequently in going around\r\ncurves; so it was necessary to provide an appliance to prevent this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PILOT.\r\n\r\nThe first pilot was planned, 1832, by Robert L. Stevens. A frame made\r\nof oak, eight by four feet, pinned together at the corners, was made.\r\nUnder one end of it a pair of wheels twenty-six inches in diameter\r\nwere placed in boxes, and the other end was fastened to an extension\r\nof the axle outside of the forward driving wheels, it having been\r\nfound by experience that a play of about one inch on each side on the\r\npedestals of the front wheels of the pilot or engine was necessary in\r\norder to get around the curves then in the tracks. For years afterward\r\nthere was very little change in constructing the pilots from that\r\noriginally applied to the \"John Bull.\"\r\n\r\nThe spiral spring, which held the front wheels of the pilot in place,\r\nacted substantially as the center pin of a truck. The turntables in\r\nuse on the road were so short that it was necessary to unconnect and\r\ntake off these pilots before turning the engine. After the pilot was\r\nadopted the forward large wheel on right of the engine was made loose\r\non the shaft in order to afford additional play in going around\r\ncurves. Other[6] changes and additions were also made in the\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 6: Changes in the locomotive \"John Bull\" since date of\r\n  construction, 1830:\r\n\r\n  Steam dome changed from rear of boiler forward to a part over what\r\n  was called the \"man-hole,\" and throttle valve placed therein.\r\n\r\n  Steam pipes changed to outside of boiler, connecting new dome with\r\n  smoke box, entering it on each side.\r\n\r\n  In the beginning the reverse gear was changed from one single\r\n  eccentric rod on each side to two on each side, connecting on to\r\n  the same eccentric wheel, and the lifting rod, in pulling back,\r\n  lifted the forward gear hook off the rocker arm, and the back\r\n  motion hook then connecting on the rocker arm reversed the engine.\r\n\r\n  Side rods were never used.\r\n\r\n  Driver spring was changed from a bearing under the pedestal boxes\r\n  to a point over the boxes.\r\n\r\n  The pilot was attached in this manner:\r\n\r\n  Right forward wheel being loose, forward axle extended eight\r\n  inches beyond box on each side; to this was attached the beam of\r\n  the pilot, having play of about one inch between box and pedestal\r\n  plate to act while going around curves. The weight of forward part\r\n  of engine rested upon a cross brace of the two-wheel pilot, which\r\n  took bearing by a screw pin surrounded by a spring, by turning\r\n  which pin the weight on the drivers could be adjusted.\r\n\r\n  A brace used as a hand rail was added on top of the frame, bracing\r\n  frame and acting as a guide to the driving springs.\r\n\r\n  Water-cocks changed from right to left side of the boiler.\r\n\r\n  Bell, whistle and headlight were added.\r\n\r\n  Balance safety valve scale was changed forward to a point over\r\n  barrel of boiler, the secret valve being over the new dome.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN LOCOMOTIVE BUILDING.\r\n\r\nDuring 1831-35 the company's shops were located at Hoboken, N.J., and\r\nduring the winter of 1832-33, three locomotives were commenced at\r\nthese shops (two completed before March, 1833, the other in April),\r\nthe valves, cylinders, pistons, etc., coming from England, the boilers\r\nbeing made under the direction of Robert L. Stevens. It was his\r\nopinion that the \"John Bull\" was too heavy, and the new boilers were\r\nbuilt smaller and lighter, so that the engines, when completed,\r\nweighed eight instead of ten tons. With these three engines, which\r\nwere delivered to the railroad company at South Amboy, the stone\r\nblocks and other material for the permanent track was delivered along\r\nthe line of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALDWIN'S FIRST LOCOMOTIVES.\r\n\r\nThe importation of the locomotive \"John Bull\" was destined to have a\r\nfar-reaching influence in moulding the types of early American\r\nlocomotives.\r\n\r\nAfter the demonstration of November 12, 1831, the engine was taken\r\nfrom the track and stored in a shed constructed to protect it until\r\nsuch time as the track should be completed.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the proprietor of Peale's Museum, in\r\nPhiladelphia, applied to Matthias Baldwin, an ingenious mathematical\r\ninstrument maker, for a small locomotive to run upon a circular track\r\non the floor of the museum. Mr. Baldwin had heard of this locomotive.\r\nHe came to Bordentown and applied to Isaac Dripps for permission to\r\ninspect it. Mr. Dripps tells me he remembers very well the day that he\r\nexplained to Mr. Baldwin the construction of the various working\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin built a toy engine for Mr. Peale, which was so successful,\r\nthat in 1832 he was called upon by the Philadelphia and Germantown\r\nRailroad Company to construct the old \"Ironsides,\"[7] which was\r\nsimilar in many ways to the \"John Bull,\" as an examination of the\r\nmodel preserved in the National Museum will show. The success of this\r\nengine laid the foundation for the great Baldwin Locomotive Works,\r\nwhich is in existence to-day, sending locomotives to every part of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 7: A handsome model of the \"Ironsides\" was presented to\r\n  the United States National Museum by the Baldwin Locomotive\r\n  Company in 1888.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINE FROM BORDENTOWN TO SOUTH AMBOY.\r\n\r\nThe Camden and Amboy Company having obtained control of the steamboat\r\nroutes between Philadelphia and Bordentown, and between South Amboy\r\nand New York, directed their energies to completing the railway across\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nAlthough the grading of the road from Bordentown to Camden had been\r\ncommenced in the summer of 1831, work on that end of the line was\r\nabandoned for about two years, the entire construction force being put\r\non the work between Bordentown and South Amboy.\r\n\r\nThe road from Bordentown to Hightstown was completed by the middle of\r\nSeptember, 1832, and from Hightstown to South Amboy in the December\r\nfollowing. The \"deep cut\" at South Amboy, and the curves of the track\r\nthere, gave the civil engineers great trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST AMERICAN STANDARD TRACK.\r\n\r\nThe laying of the track through the \"deep cut\" led to an event of\r\ngreat importance to future railway construction. The authorities at\r\nSing Sing having failed to deliver the stone blocks rapidly enough,\r\nMr. Stevens ordered hewn wooden cross ties to be laid temporarily, and\r\nthe rail to be directly spiked thereto. A number of these ties were\r\nlaid on the sharpest curves in the cut. They showed such satisfactory\r\nproperties when the road began to be operated that they were permitted\r\nto remain, and the stone blocks already in the track were replaced by\r\nwooden ties as rapidly as practicable. Without doubt the piece of\r\ntrack in \"deep cut\" was the first in the world to be laid according to\r\nthe present American practice of spiking the rail directly to the\r\ncross tie.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINE OPENED BETWEEN BORDENTOWN AND SOUTH AMBOY.\r\n\r\nAmong the memoranda compiled by Benjamin Fish, published in his\r\nmemoir, I find the following:\r\n\r\n    \"First cars were put on the Camden and Amboy Railroad\r\n    September 19, 1832. They were drawn by two horses. They took\r\n    the directors and a few friends from Bordentown to Hightstown\r\n    and back.\r\n\r\n    \"On December 17, 1832, the first passengers were taken from\r\n    Bordentown through to South Amboy. Fifty or sixty people went.\r\n    It was a rainy day.\r\n\r\n    \"On January 24, 1833, the first freight cars were put on the\r\n    railroad. There were three cars, drawn by one horse each, with\r\n    six or seven thousand pounds of freight on each car.\r\n\r\n    \"Freight came from New York by steam boat to South Amboy. I\r\n    drove the first car, John Twine drove the second car and\r\n    Edmund Page the third one. We came to the Sand Hills (near\r\n    Bordentown) by railroad, there loaded the goods on wagons (it\r\n    was winter, and the river was frozen over), arriving in\r\n    Philadelphia by sunrise next morning. The goods left New York\r\n    at 12 o'clock, noon. This was done by the old firm of Hill,\r\n    Fish & Abbe.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the road from Bordentown to South Amboy was\r\ncompleted, and as late as the summer of 1833, passengers were brought\r\nfrom Philadelphia to the wharf at White Hill by steamboat, and from\r\nthere were rapidly driven to Amboy. Two horses were hitched to each\r\ncar, and as they were driven continuously on the run, three changes of\r\nhorses were required, the finest horses obtainable being purchased for\r\nthis purpose. The time consumed in crossing the State (thirty-four\r\nmiles) was from two and a half to three hours.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, 1833, the locomotive \"John Bull\" was put on the\r\ntrain leaving Bordentown about 7 o'clock in the morning, and returning\r\nleaving South Amboy at 4 P.M. This was the first passenger train\r\nregularly run by steam on the route between New York and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH CRUISER ÆOLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new twin screw cruiser Æolus was launched from the Devonport\r\nDockyard on the 13th November. The first keel plate of the Æolus was\r\nlaid in position on the 10th March last year, and up to the present\r\ntime fully two thirds of the estimated weight has been worked into her\r\nstructure. Says _Industries_: She is built of steel, with large\r\nphosphor bronze castings for stern post, shaft brackets, and stem, the\r\nlatter terminating in a formidable ram. The hull is sheathed with\r\nwood, and will be covered with copper to enable her to keep the seas\r\nfor a lengthened period on remote stations, where there is a lack of\r\ndocking accommodation. All the vital portions, such as machinery,\r\nboilers, magazines, and steering gear, are protected by a steel deck\r\nrunning fore and aft, terminating forward in the ram, of which it\r\nvirtually forms a part. Subdivision has been made a special feature in\r\nthis type of vessel, and the hull under the upper deck is divided into\r\nnearly 100 water tight compartments. Between perpendiculars the Æolus\r\nmeasures 300 ft. in length, the extreme breadth being 43 ft. 8 in.,\r\nand moulded depth 22 ft. 9 in., with a displacement of 3,600 tons on a\r\nmean draught of water of 17 ft. 6 in. She will be supplied by Messrs.\r\nHawthorn, Leslie & Co., of Newcastle on Tyne, with two sets of\r\nvertical triple-expansion engines, capable of developing collectively\r\n9,000 h.p., which is estimated to realize a speed of 19.75 knots. As\r\nvertical engines have been adopted, the necessary protection of the\r\ncylinders, which project above the steel protective deck, is obtained\r\nby fitting an armored breastwork of steel 5 in. thick, supported by a\r\n7 in. teak backing, around the engine hatchway. Provision is made for\r\na bunker coal capacity of 400 tons, and this is calculated to give a\r\nradius of action of 8,000 knots at a reduced speed of 10 knots. The\r\narmament of the ship will consist of two 6 in. breech-loading guns on\r\ncentral pivot stands, one mounted on the poop and another on the\r\nforecastle; six quick-firing 4.7 in. guns, mounted three on each\r\nbroadside; eight quick-firing 6-pounder guns, four on each broadside;\r\nbesides one 3-pounder Hotchkiss and four 5-barrel Nordenfeldt guns. In\r\naddition four torpedo tubes are fitted, one forward, one aft, and one\r\non each broadside. All the necessary appliances for manipulating the\r\nengines, guns, steering gear, etc., when in action, are placed in a\r\nconning tower built of steel 3 in. thick, and situated at the after\r\nend of the forecastle. The Æolus will be rigged with two pole mast,\r\ncarrying light fore and aft sails only. Her total cost is estimated at\r\n£188,350, of which £100,000 is regarded as the cost of hull. When\r\ncomplete she will be manned by a complement of 254 officers and men.\r\nIn the slipway vacated by the Æolus a second class cruiser, to be\r\nnamed the Hermione, will be laid down forthwith. The Hermione may be\r\nregarded as an enlarged Æolus, and will measure 320 ft. in length, 49\r\nft. 6 in. in breadth, with a displacement of 4,360 tons, on a mean\r\ndraught of water of 19 ft. The new cruiser will be supplied with\r\npropelling machinery of the same power as the Æolus, to be constructed\r\nin the dockyard from Admiralty designs. The coal capacity of the\r\nHermione is to be 400 tons, and her estimated speed is 19.5 knots.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIALS OF H.M. CRUISER BLAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial interest, says _Engineering_, attaches to the trials of the\r\nprotected cruiser Blake, in view of the assertion frequently made by\r\nAdmiralty authorities, from the first lord downward, to the effect\r\nthat with her sister ship Blenheim she would surpass anything hitherto\r\nattempted. The condition of steaming continuously for long periods and\r\nover great distances at 20 knots per hour was made a ruling condition\r\nin the design, and with forced draught she was to be able to attain 22\r\nknots when occasion required. But all idea of getting these high\r\nresults has been abandoned. Our readers do not need to be reminded of\r\nthe frequent failure of boilers in the navy. Although in the newer\r\nships, profit has been gained by experience, larger boilers being\r\nprovided with separate combustion chambers for each furnace; the\r\nBlake's boilers belong to the type of defective design, with the\r\nresult that, were they pressed under forced draught, the tubes would\r\nleak. It was, therefore, decided some time ago to be content with\r\nnatural draught results, and on Wednesday, Nov. 18, the vessel was\r\ntaken out from Portsmouth, and ran for seven hours with satisfactory\r\nresults, considerably exceeding the contract power. But the speed was\r\nbut 19.12 knots, and 22 knots can never be attained, except, of\r\ncourse, new boilers be provided, and when an expenditure of 5 or 6 per\r\ncent. of the first cost of the vessel (433,755_l._) would give her new\r\nboilers, it seems a pity to be content with the lesser speed, more\r\nparticularly as the vessel is well designed and the engines efficient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW BRITISH CRUISER BLAKE.]\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the engines and their trials, it may be stated\r\nthat the vessel is of 9000 tons displacement at 25 ft. 9 in. mean\r\ndraught. Her length is 375 ft. and her beam 65 ft. She was built at\r\nChatham, and the armament consists of two 92 in. 22-ton breech-loading\r\nguns, ten 6-in. 5-ton guns and sixteen 3-pounder quick-firing, and\r\neight machine guns, with torpedo launching carriages and tubes. The\r\npropelling engines were manufactured by Messrs. Maudslay Sons & Field,\r\nLambeth. They were designed to develop 13,000 horses with natural, and\r\n20,000 with forced draught. They consist of four distinct sets of\r\ntriple expansion inverted cylinder engines, and occupy with boilers,\r\netc., nearly two-thirds of the length of the ship. They are placed in\r\nfour separate compartments, two sets being coupled together on the\r\nstarboard and port sides respectively for driving each screw. There\r\nare four high pressure cylinders, 36 in. in diameter; four\r\nintermediate cylinders, 52 in.; and four low pressure cylinders, 80\r\nin.; with a stroke of 4 ft. Each set of engines has an air pump 33 in.\r\nin diameter and 2 ft. stroke, and a surface condenser having 12,800\r\ntubes and an aggregate surface of 2250 square feet, the length of the\r\ntubes between the tube plates being 9 ft. There is also in each\r\ncompartment one centrifugal circulating pump driven by a small\r\nindependent engine, of the diameter of 3 ft. 9 in., and capable of\r\npumping from the bilge as well as the sea. The screw propellers are 18\r\nft. 3 in. in diameter with a mean pitch of 24 ft. 6 in.\r\n\r\nSteam is furnished by six main double-ended boilers, having four\r\nfurnaces at each end, and one auxiliary boiler, with a heating surface\r\nof 900 sq. ft., the dimensions of the former being 15 ft. 2 in. by 18\r\nft., and of the latter 10 ft. by 9 ft. long. The total area of\r\nfiregrate surface is 863 sq. ft, and of heating surface 26.936 sq. ft.\r\nEach engine room is kept cool by four 4 ft. 6 in. fans. Forced draught\r\nis produced by twelve 5 ft. 6 in. fans, three being stationed in each\r\nstokehold. The electric lighting machinery consists of three dynamos\r\nof Siemens manufacture driven by a Willans engine, each of which is\r\ncapable of producing a current of 400 amperes. The after main engines\r\ncan be easily disconnected and worked separately for slow speeds.\r\n\r\nThe Blake had her steering gear tested on Tuesday, Nov. 17. With both\r\nengines going full power ahead and turning to starboard, with her helm\r\nhard over 35 deg., she completed the circle in 4 min. 40 sec., the\r\nport circle being completed in 5 min. 5 sec. The diameter was\r\nestimated approximately to be about 575 yards. Forty-five seconds were\r\nrequired to change from engine steering to steering by hand. By manual\r\ngear the helm was moved from midships to hard a-starboard in 40 sec.,\r\nfrom starboard to hard a-port in 2 min. 10 sec., and from hard a-port\r\nto midships in 2 min. 20 sec. The heavy balanced rudder and the speed\r\nof the ship throwing great labor upon the crew manning the wheels, the\r\nhand gear was afterward disconnected and the connection with the\r\nsteering engine completed in 40 sec.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW BRITISH CRUISER BLAKE]\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 18, when the vessel went on speed trials, the draught of the\r\nvessel was 24 ft. 8 in. forward and 26 ft. 8 in. aft, which gave her\r\nthe mean load immersion provided for in her design. There was a\r\nsingular absence of vibration, said to be due to the space over which\r\nthe machinery is spread, but perhaps also due, in part at least, to\r\nthe number of cranks, as the cylinders deliver six throws throughout\r\nthe circle of revolution.

Four runs were made on the measured mile with and against\r\nthe tide, the mean of means disclosing a speed of 19.12 knots. The\r\naverage speed of the seven hours' steaming, as measured by patent log,\r\nwas 19.28 knots.

It cannot be expected\r\nthat in this age, when so many thousands of people on shore fail from\r\noverwork and \"high pressure,\" steamship masters, who as a class, are\r\noverworked and harrassed to a serious extent, should altogether\r\nescape. Again, unless a shipmaster takes an interest in the health,\r\ncomfort, and well-being of his crew, he, in the first place, neglects\r\none of his duties, and, secondly, sows the seeds of discomfort and\r\nannoyance to himself. Let us consider his duties to himself\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, he must prepare himself to undergo, periodically, the\r\ndiscomfort of want of proper rest and irregularity in times of meals;\r\nhe may, for instance, not be able to leave the bridge for over\r\nforty-eight hours or more on a stretch, and, of course, any shipmaster\r\nwho may read this will know that this is no uncommon occurrence;\r\nduring this time he may be unable to get regular meals, and what he\r\ndoes get may have to be eaten in a hurry and at an anxious time when\r\nhe cannot properly enjoy and digest it.\r\n\r\nA time like this may be followed by a period of rest, when the days\r\nwill hang heavily on his hands, and he will be tempted to long\r\nafternoon sleeps merely to get through the weary hours.\r\n\r\nNow, as a course of this kind of thing is bound, unless care be\r\nexercised, to act unfavorably on the digestion and bring on some form\r\nof dyspepsia, so also the nights and days of great anxiety and moments\r\nof great strain will, besides increasing the dyspeptic tendency, be\r\napt to bring on nervousness in some form or other. It is a fact that\r\nin these times, and often from want of attention to health, nearly\r\nevery shipmaster long in harness is more or less nervous.\r\n\r\nThere are people in the present day who have actually talked of making\r\ntheir chief engineer (who exercises his special trade at sea or on\r\nshore as suits himself and is in no sense _a seaman_) the master of\r\nthe vessel, and turning the shipmaster into a mere pilot. Those who\r\ntalk in this way forget that to do this the _responsibility_ must be\r\nshifted on to the engineer. Of course such a change as this cannot\r\nhappen, the country would not stand it; but I merely mention it to\r\nshow the vast amount of ignorance there is, even among those who\r\nshould be well informed, as to the real strain and responsibility on\r\nthe modern shipmaster.\r\n\r\nThe master then, if anxious to do the best for himself, should, if\r\npossible, be a total abstainer, for two reasons: first, because, as he\r\nwill be obliged to be irregular in his feeding, alcohol in any form\r\nwill do him harm and tend to augment the dyspepsia. Secondly, because,\r\noften in times of great mental strain, combined with exposure, a glass\r\nof spirits will give _great temporary relief_ (which is of itself a\r\ndangerous fact for a weak-minded man), but this will always be\r\nfollowed by depression, and will in reality be doing great harm\r\ninstead of lasting good. Spirituous liquor may be necessary for a few,\r\nbut these should use it under medical advice if at all. It is a hard\r\nthing for many men to give up their grog, but there is not a man of\r\nany experience in the merchant service who has not seen its blasting\r\neffects on many a master and officer. It is almost impossible to find\r\na substitute for it which shall recommend itself to anyone who has\r\nreally a liking for it, about the only things being coffee, lime\r\njuice, or lemonade and ginger ale. So-called temperance drinks are all\r\nof them very nasty stuff, besides containing a large percentage of\r\nalcohol; rather than swallow these one had better not change his\r\nhabits. The master then, being an abstainer, should also give some\r\ncare to his diet. Very heavy meals of meat and strong food should not\r\nbe taken at sea, because there are no means of taking proper exercise,\r\nand it is impossible to work them off properly. Again, long, heavy,\r\nafter-dinner sleeps should not be indulged in; a quiet nap of ten\r\nminutes would in many cases be beneficial, but the long sleep up to\r\nfive o'clock is positively harmful to any man. One of the _best_\r\nthings a master can do is to take up some work. No matter what it is\r\nso long as he takes an interest in it, such as joiner work, fret work,\r\npainting, writing, learning a musical instrument or a foreign\r\nlanguage, or anything of that sort. It will be of incalculable benefit\r\nto both mind and body.\r\n\r\nOn occasions when it is absolutely necessary to be on deck for long\r\nperiods, the steward ought to have orders to attend _himself\r\npersonally_ to the master's wants--to see that his meals are properly\r\ncooked and brought up to him at regular intervals, and that there is\r\nalways a _well made_ cup of coffee to be had when wanted. The ordinary\r\ncup of coffee as made at sea is generally a beastly mixture and not\r\nworth drinking. The steward has an easy life and should not be spared\r\nat these times, but should always be turned out when wanted, _night or\r\nday_, and made to look after these things himself, and a man who\r\ngrowls at having this to do or who will not take the proper trouble to\r\nsee things well cooked and served up nicely with cheerfulness should\r\n_at once_ be discharged, and a good man, of whom there are plenty,\r\nshipped in his place. The master, of course, should always be on the\r\nbridge when required, and in fog certainly all the time; but many men\r\nare over-cautious in this respect through sheer nervousness, and\r\noftentimes expose and fatigue themselves to no purpose, harass their\r\nofficers, and make them unreliable, so that when the time comes that\r\ntheir presence on deck is absolutely necessary, they are, through\r\nexhaustion of mind and body, in anything but a fit state to take\r\ncharge of the ship, or be cool and collected in a moment of sudden\r\nemergency. Should a man feel that through hard work and exposure he is\r\nbecoming shaky, he should at once leave off _entirely_ the false\r\nrelief which drink gives and consult a physician. A _good_ man with\r\n_experience_ will in almost any case be able to help him, and, besides\r\nmedicine, give him such hints for regulating his diet and mode of\r\nliving as will enable him to bear better than before the strain and\r\nwear and tear of his life.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: For the _fluttering_, unsteady feeling often felt,\r\n  the following, if not abused, will be found beneficial: Take as\r\n  much bromide of potassium as will lie, not heaped up, on a\r\n  shilling, and half a teaspoonful of sal volatile (aromatic spirits\r\n  of ammonia). Mix in a wine glass full of water; but this should\r\n  only be taken when absolutely necessary, and not habitually.]\r\n\r\nAs to the crew. A master who has full command of himself ought to be\r\nable to rule judiciously even the most unruly crew, but before he is\r\nin a really _strong_ position to do this, he must treat them fairly\r\nand honestly. In many cases a bad start is made with a new set of men\r\n(of course this will not apply to the high class mail steamers, nor\r\nperhaps to what are termed weekly boats). They come on board and find\r\ntheir forecastle just as the last crew left it, full of a week's\r\nfilth,[2] possibly lumbered up with hauling lines and what-not,\r\nwanting painting badly, and often showing unmistakable signs of\r\noverhead leakage. This is quite enough to make a respectable man\r\ndiscontented, and naturally so. In common fairness, the often wretched\r\nplace that the men have to occupy ought to be put in decent order to\r\nreceive the new crew. Again, they should be distinctly made to\r\nunderstand, when signing articles, what their _food_ will be, and what\r\ntheir pay and allowances will come to. It is to be feared that bad\r\nfeeding is the cause of much trouble in these days. From first coming\r\non board discipline should be _enforced_; many officers, both young\r\nand old, are greatly remiss in enforcing this, with the consequence\r\nthat day by day it is harder to do, till at last it is impossible, and\r\nanarchy reigns triumphant. If a seaman finds that he is _fairly_\r\ntreated, and that he _must_ obey orders, he will in nine cases out of\r\nten conduct himself well, and give no trouble. The more high class\r\ntype of man the master is the better he will treat his men, and the\r\nmore exacting he will be in compelling discipline, both in his\r\nofficers and crew.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: This should not be. It is most decidedly one of the\r\n  master's duties to see that the men on _both_ sides of the\r\n  forecastle keep their places clean, and for this purpose it is a\r\n  very good plan to give them an hour or two every week, and it is\r\n  only right that if a crew fled a forecastle clean to receive them,\r\n  they should be made to leave it in the same state.]\r\n\r\nEngineers and firemen are often sources of annoyance in these days.\r\nFiremen are a lower class generally than seamen, and more inclined to\r\ninsubordination; in many cases the engineers are quite incapable of\r\nkeeping them in proper order, and it sometimes happens that in an\r\nengine room row it falls to the lot of the deck officers to restore\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nThe master should remember that his engineers are officers of the\r\nship, with their own responsibility, that his chief engineer is of\r\nsome importance on board, and that it is necessary in the owner's\r\ninterests that they should work together amicably. In ordinary cargo\r\nvessels, the engineer is often better educated than the master\r\nhimself, and should _never_ be treated as an inferior while he behaves\r\nwith proper respect to the master. To his own deck officers the master\r\nshould behave with ordinary courtesy, and, if he finds them\r\ntrustworthy, should not spoil them and render them unreliable by\r\nalways keeping on or about the bridge; an officer who is never left by\r\nhimself in charge will soon fancy himself incapable. It is to be\r\nfeared that many young officers are spoiled in this way.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with the men before the mast is always unwise. It is not a\r\ngood practice in ordinary vessels, where a new crew is shipped each\r\nvoyage, to begin by calling the men \"Tom\" and \"Jack.\" An officer to\r\nhave any real command over the men _must_ keep himself apart from them\r\nand show them the difference of their positions. A judicious\r\nshipmaster will warn his young mates about this.\r\n\r\nThe usual system of mess room for engineers, the officers messing in\r\nthe cabin with the master, is a good one, though it is a question\r\nwhether it would not be a _very_ good thing if the chief engineer\r\nalways messed with the master so long as he was a decent, respectable\r\nman. It is often one of the causes of ill health in the master that he\r\nkeeps too much to himself, seldom if ever speaking to his officers\r\nexcept on business connected with the ship. A man who does this has\r\nfar too much time to think, and if he has any trivial illness is apt\r\nto brood over it and actually make himself ill.\r\n\r\nIt is much wiser and better for all concerned that the master should,\r\nwithin certain limits, be on friendly terms at any rate with his first\r\nmate, if not with all his officers. Any man with common tact can\r\nalways find means for checking undue familiarity, and it will\r\ngenerally be found that officers treated as equals instead, as is\r\noften the case, as though they were an inferior race of beings, will\r\nbe much more inclined to do their work with zeal, and to back up the\r\nmaster in all his troubles. Many men when they get command seem to\r\nforget that they ever were officers themselves. It is the general\r\nopinion that the strict ship is the most comfortable one, and as a\r\nrule the master who will take the trouble to enforce proper discipline\r\nfore and aft is just the very man who will also be considerate and\r\ncourteous to those who sail under his command--whatever be their rank.\r\n\r\nTo govern others well a man _must_ first have learned to govern\r\nhimself. The first lesson for a young seaman to learn is obedience,\r\nand unless he does learn this lesson he will not know how to enforce\r\nit when he becomes an officer, and still less will he be fit for his\r\nposition when he obtains command. It is to be feared that many _never_\r\nlearn this lesson, and that this is the cause of much of the\r\ninsubordination rife in these days.\r\n\r\nIf the modern hard-driven shipmaster would exercise greater care as to\r\nhis health and habits, and would strive more after being a true\r\n_master_ over his ship's company, and this is easier to be gained by\r\nrespect than fear, things would go on more smoothly, and when he did\r\nget away for a time from all the petty annoyances of shore, which are\r\nmore especially felt in his home port, he would have a time of\r\ncomparative comfort, would live longer and happier, and, possibly,\r\nescape the terrible attacks of nervous depression which have finished\r\nthe career of many a too finely strung _fin de siecle_ shipmaster.\r\n--_Nautical Magazine._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfred Tennyson, the poet laureate of England, was born at Sornersby,\r\nLincolnshire, April 9, 1810, and was the third of a large family of\r\nchildren, eight of whom were boys and three girls. His father was a\r\nclergyman, a man of remarkably fine abilities; his mother, as should\r\nbe the mother of a great poet, was a deeply religious woman with a\r\nsensitive spirit that was keenly attuned to the aspects of nature. It\r\nwas from her that Tennyson inherited his poetic temperament combined\r\nwith the love of study that was a characteristic of his father.\r\nTennyson's brother, Charles, superintended the construction of his\r\nyounger brother's first poetic composition, which was written upon a\r\nslate when the great laureate was a child of seven. Tennyson's parents\r\nwere people who had sufficient of this world's wealth to educate their\r\nsons well, and Alfred was sent to Trinity College, where he as a mere\r\nlad won the gold medal for a poem in blank verse entitled \"Timbuctoo,\"\r\nwhich is to be found in all the volumes of his collected works, though\r\nmany of the other poems produced in that period are not given place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED TENNYSON, POET LAUREATE OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nHis first volume of poems was published in 1827, and in them the\r\ninfluence of Byron, whom he passionately admired, is everywhere\r\nvisible. In 1830 he issued another volume, which defined his position\r\nas a poet of great promise, but which was criticised by Christopher\r\nNorth with the most biting sarcasm, and which was held up to ridicule\r\nby the great Lockhart. More than ten years followed in which the poet\r\nwrote nothing, then he began a literary career which lifted him to the\r\nhighest place in the literary world, a place which he has since held,\r\nand as a lyric poet he has never been equaled.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 he issued that most wonderful production in any language, \"In\r\nMemoriam,\" which has enriched the English language by hundreds of\r\nquotations and which in its delicate sentiment, its deep sorrow, its\r\nreflective tenderness, has been the voice of many a soul similarly\r\nbereft.\r\n\r\nHad Tennyson never written anything but \"In Memoriam,\" his fame would\r\nhave been assured, but \"The Idylls of the King,\" \"Enoch Arden,\" \"The\r\nPrincess,\" and other great compositions will stand forever to his\r\ncredit. Of Tennyson's personal character much has been said and\r\nwritten. As pure and sweet as his poetry, beloved by a large circle of\r\nfriends, active still in literary work, it may be said of him that he\r\nhas always worn\r\n\r\n    \"without reproach\r\n    The grand old name of gentleman,\"\r\n\r\nand that his mellow old age is the ripening into fruit of \"the white\r\nflower of a blameless life.\"--_Chicago Graphic._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTIETH YEAR OF THE PRINCE OF WALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of a distinguished person whose public life has a claim to\r\nbe regarded with national and social interest, his fiftieth birthday\r\nmust be considered a jubilee; and Monday, Nov. 9, in the present year,\r\ncompleting that number of anniversaries for the eldest son of her\r\nMajesty the Queen, the heir apparent to the crown of the United\r\nKingdom, is manifestly an occasion demanding such congratulations as\r\nmust arise from sentiments of loyalty to the monarchical constitution\r\nand of respect for the reigning family. His Royal Highness, it is\r\nunderstood, has preferred to have it treated simply as a private and\r\ndomestic affair, entertaining a party of his personal friends, and not\r\ninviting any formal addresses from the representatives of municipal\r\ncorporations or other public bodies. Nevertheless, it may be permitted\r\nto journalists, taking note of this period in the life of so important\r\na contemporary personage, to express their continued good wishes for\r\nhis health and happiness, and to indulge in a few retrospective\r\nobservations on his past career.\r\n\r\nBorn on Nov. 9, 1841, second of the offspring of Queen Victoria by her\r\nmarriage with the late Prince Consort, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales,\r\ninherited the greatest blessing of humanity, that of having good\r\nparents and wise guardians of his childhood and youth. His instruction\r\nat home was, no doubt, wider in range of studies than that of ordinary\r\nEnglish boys, including an acquaintance with several European\r\nlanguages and with modern history, needful to qualify him for the\r\nduties of a prince. He was further educated at Christ Church, Oxford,\r\nand at Trinity College, Cambridge; was enrolled a law student of the\r\nMiddle Temple and held a commission in the army.\r\n\r\nHis earliest appearance in a leading part on any public occasion was\r\nin 1858 or 1859, we think at the laying of the foundation stone of the\r\nLambeth School of Art at Vauxhall; but after the lamented death of his\r\nfather, in December, 1861, the Prince of Wales naturally became the\r\nmost eminent and desirable performer of all ceremonies in which\r\nbeneficent or useful undertakings were to be recognized by royal\r\napproval. This work has occupied a very large share of his time during\r\nthirty years; and we can all testify that it has been discharged with\r\nsuch frank good will, cordiality, and unaffected graciousness, with\r\nsuch patient attention, diligence, and punctuality, as to deserve the\r\ngratitude of large numbers of her Majesty's subjects in almost every\r\npart of the kingdom. No prince of any country in any age has ever\r\npersonally exerted himself more constantly and faithfully, in\r\nrendering services of this kind to the community, than the Prince of\r\nWales. The multiplicity and variety of his engagements, on behalf of\r\nlocal and special objects of utility, would make a surprising list,\r\nand they must have involved a sacrifice of ease and leisure, and\r\nendurance of self-imposed restraint, a submission to tedious\r\nrepetitions of similar acts and scenes, and to continual requests and\r\nimportunities, which few men of high rank would like to undergo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRINCE OF WALES AND FAMILY--FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH OF\r\nMESSRS. BYRNE, RICHMOND.]\r\n\r\nThe marriage of his Royal Highness to Princess Alexandra of Denmark,\r\non March 10, 1863, was one of the happiest events within the memory of\r\nthis generation. It tended visibly, of course, to raise and confirm\r\nhis position as leader of English society, and as the active dispenser\r\nof that encouragement which royalty can bestow on commendable public\r\nobjects. Charity, education, science, art, music, industry,\r\nagriculture, and local improvements are in no small measure advanced\r\nby this patronage. The Prince of Wales may not be so learned in some\r\nof these matters as his accomplished father, but he has taken as much\r\ntrouble to assist the endless labors of the immediate agents, in doing\r\nwhich he has shown good judgment and discretion, and a considerable\r\ndegree of business talent--notably, in the British preparations for\r\nthe Paris Exhibition of 1867, the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of\r\n1886 in London, and the organization of the Imperial Institute. The\r\nlast-named institution and the Royal College of Music will be\r\npermanent memorials of the directing energy of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few examples or slight indications of the work he has\r\nactually done for us all. It is unnecessary to mention the incidental\r\nsalutary influences of his visits to Canada and to India, which have\r\nleft an abiding favorable impression of English royalty in those\r\nprovinces of the empire. Nor can it be requisite to observe the manner\r\nin which the prince's country estate and mansion at Sandringham, with\r\nhis care of agricultural improvement, of stock breeding, studs, and\r\nother rural concerns, has set an example to landowners, the value of\r\nwhich is already felt. We refrain upon this occasion from speaking of\r\nthe Princess of Wales, or of the sons and daughters, whose lives, we\r\ntrust, will be always good and happy. It is on the personal merits and\r\nservices of the head of their illustrious house, with reference only\r\nto public interests, that we have thought it needful to dwell, in view\r\nof the fiftieth birthday of his Royal Highness; and very heartily to\r\nwish him, in homely English phrase, \"Many happy returns of the\r\nday!\"--_Illustrated London News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT WITH SUCRATE OF LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have experimented with carbonate of lithia as an accelerator, and I\r\nhave obtained with it rather favorable results. However, in opposition\r\nto Mr. Wickers, I have always found that carbonate of lithia, used\r\neven in larger doses than those recommended by this author, was not\r\nsufficiently active, and that development had to be too much prolonged\r\nin order to obtain prints of good intensity. I have also observed that\r\nthe prints developed by this process were as often fogged as when I\r\nmade use of carbonate of potash. The oxides of alkaline metals or\r\ntheir alkaline salts are not the only accelerators susceptible of\r\nbeing used in pyro development. Two oxides of the earthy alkaline\r\nmetals, lime and hydrate of barytes, may also be used as accelerators.\r\nI will not insist upon the second, which, although giving some\r\nresults, should be rejected from photographic practice on account of\r\nits caustic properties, and of its too great affinity for the carbonic\r\nacids in the air, which prevents the keeping of its solutions. This\r\nobjection does not obtain for the first, provided, however, that\r\nordinary lime water is not used, but a solution of succharate or\r\nsucrate of lime. In my experiments I have made use of the following\r\nsolutions:\r\n\r\n                    _Solution A._\r\n\r\nPyrogallic acid.                           10 grms.\r\nSulphite of soda.                          20   \"\r\nCitric acid.                                2   \"\r\nWater.                                    120   \"\r\n\r\n                    _Solution B._\r\nWater.                                   1000  \"\r\nSugar.              sufficient quantity to triturate.\r\n\r\nTo which add a sufficient quantity of pure lime to saturate the sugar\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we get a highly concentrated liquid, very alkaline, and\r\nwhich keeps for a considerable time. To develop, I mix:\r\n\r\nWater.                   80 cubic cent.\r\nSolution A.               2    \"       \"\r\n\r\nI throw this over the plate, and allow it to remain for a few moments,\r\nagitating, then I add to this bath gradually and according to the\r\nresults obtained, from one to two cubic centimeters of the solution B.\r\nThese solutions should be made with a great deal of care and prudence,\r\nas the sucrate of lime is an accelerator of very great energy.\r\nMoreover, according as the plate has been more or less exposed, we may\r\nadd to the developing bath a few drops of a solution of citric acid,\r\nor of a solution of an alkaline bromide. We obtain in this way very\r\nsoft prints, sometimes too soft, which, however, are not more free\r\nfrom fogging than plates developed with hydrochinon (new bath), or\r\npyro having for accelerators ammonia, potash, soda, carbonate of\r\npotash, of soda, or of lithia. I do not give this process with sucrate\r\nof lime as perfect, but I give it as perfectable and susceptible of\r\napplication. If I have undertaken to write these few lines it is\r\nbecause it has never been brought to my knowledge that up to the\r\npresent time the oxides and the alkaline salts of the earthy alkaline\r\nmetals have been studied from a photographic point of view.--_Leon\r\nDegoix in Photo.

LUMSDEN.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Paper read before the Astronomical and Physical\r\n  Society of Toronto, Canada, April 18, 1891.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the palmiest days in the eventful history of physical and\r\nobservational astronomy. Along the whole line of professional and\r\namateur observation substantial progress is being made, but in certain\r\nnew directions, and in some old ones, too, the advance is very rapid.\r\nAs never before, public interest is alive to the attractions and value\r\nof the work of astronomers. The science itself now appeals to a\r\nconstituency of students and readers daily increasing in numbers and\r\nimportance. Evidence of this gratifying fact is easily obtained. There\r\nis at the libraries an ever-growing demand for standard astronomical\r\nworks, some of them by no means intended to be of a purely popular\r\ncharacter. Some of the most influential and conservative magazines on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic now find it to be in their interest to\r\ndevote pages of space to the careful discussion of new theories, or to\r\nthe results of the latest work of professional observers. Even the\r\ndaily press in some cities has caught the infection, if infection it\r\nmay be called. There are in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and\r\nother centers of population on this continent leading newspapers\r\nwhich, every week or so, publish columns of original matter\r\ncontributed by writers evidently able to place before their readers in\r\nan attractive form articles dealing accurately, and yet in a popular\r\nvein, with the many-sided subject of astronomy. In scientific matters\r\ngenerally, there is abroad in this and other countries a spirit of\r\ninquiry, never more apparent than at the present time.\r\n\r\nReaders and thinkers may, no doubt, be numbered by thousands. So far,\r\nhowever, as astronomy is concerned, the majority of readers and\r\nthinkers is composed of non-observers, most of whom believe they must\r\nbe content with studying the theoretical side of the subject only.\r\nThey labor under the false impression that unless they have telescopes\r\nof large aperture and other costly apparatus, the pleasures attaching\r\nto practical work are denied them. The great observatories, to which\r\nevery intelligent eye is directed, are, in a measure, though\r\ninnocently enough, responsible for this. Anticipation is ever on\r\ntiptoe. People are naturally awaiting the latest news from the giant\r\nrefracting and reflecting telescopes of the day. Under these\r\ncircumstances, it may be that the services rendered, and capable of\r\nbeing rendered, to science by smaller apertures may be overlooked,\r\nand, therefore, I ask to be permitted to put in a modest plea for the\r\ncommon telescope. What little I shall have to say will be addressed to\r\nyou more for the purpose of arousing interest in the subject than for\r\ncommunicating to you any information of a novel or special character.\r\n\r\nWhen making use of the term \"common telescope,\" I would like to be\r\nunderstood as referring to good refractors with object glasses not\r\nexceeding three or three and one-half inches in diameter. In some\r\nworks on the subject telescopes as large as five inches or even five\r\nand one-half inches are included in the description \"common,\" but\r\ninstruments of such apertures are not so frequently met with in this\r\ncountry as to justify the classing of them with smaller ones, and,\r\nperhaps, for my purpose, it is well that such is the fact, for the\r\nexpense connected with the purchase of first rate telescopes increases\r\nvery rapidly in proportion to the size of the object glass, and soon\r\nbecomes a serious matter. Should ever the larger apertures become\r\nnumerous on this continent, let us hope it shall be found to have been\r\nas one of the results of societies like this, striving to make more\r\npopular the study of astronomy.\r\n\r\nIt is not by any means proposed to inflict upon you a history of the\r\ntelescope, but your indulgence is asked for a few moments while\r\nreference is made to one or two matters connected with its invention,\r\nor, rather, its accidental discovery and subsequent improvement.\r\n\r\nThe opening years of the seventeenth century found the world without a\r\ntelescope, or, at least, such an instrument as was adapted for\r\nastronomical work. It is true that long years before, Arabian and some\r\nother eastern astronomers, for the purpose, possibly, of enabling them\r\nto concentrate their gaze upon celestial objects and follow their\r\nmotions, had been accustomed to use a kind of tube consisting of a\r\nlong cylinder without glasses of any kind and open at both ends. For\r\nmagnifying purposes, this tube was of no value. Still, it must have\r\nbeen of some kind of service, or else the first telescopes, as\r\nconstructed by the spectacle makers, who had stumbled upon the\r\nprinciple involved, were exceedingly sorry affairs, for, soon after\r\ntheir introduction, the illustrious Kepler, in his work on \"Optics,\"\r\nrecommended the employment of plain apertures, without lenses, because\r\nthey were superior to the telescope on account of their freedom from\r\nrefraction.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the principle by which distant objects could,\r\napparently, be brought nearer the eye became known and its value\r\nrecognized by philosophers, telescopes ceased to be regarded as toys,\r\nand underwent material improvements in the hands of such men as\r\nGalilei, and, later, even of Kepler himself, Cassini, Huyghens, and\r\nothers. Galilei's first telescope magnified but three times, and his\r\nbest not much above thirty times. If I comprehend aright what has been\r\nwritten upon the subject, I am justified in saying that this little\r\ninstrument in my hand, with an aperture of one inch and one-quarter,\r\nand a focus, with an astronomical eye-piece, of about ten inches, is a\r\nbetter magnifier than was Galilei's best. With it I can see the moons\r\nof Jupiter, some spots on the sun, the phases of Venus, the\r\ncomposition, in some places, of the Milky Way, the seas, the valleys,\r\nthe mountains, and, when in bold relief upon the terminator, even some\r\nof the craters and cones of the moon. Indeed, I am of opinion I can\r\nsee even more than he could, for I can readily make out a considerable\r\nportion of the Great Nebula in Orion, some double stars, and enough of\r\nthe Saturnian system to discern the disk of the planet and see that\r\nthere is something attached to its sides.\r\n\r\nFor nearly one hundred and fifty years all refracting telescopes\r\nlabored under one serious difficulty. The images formed by them were\r\nmore or less confused by rainbow tints, due to the bending, or\r\nrefracting, by the object glass of the rays of light. To overcome this\r\nobstacle to clear vision, and also to secure magnification, the focal\r\nlengths of the instruments were greatly extended. Telescopes 38, 50,\r\n78, 130, 160, 210, 400, and even 600 feet long were constructed. I\r\ncan, however, find nothing on record indicating that the object\r\nglasses of these enormously attenuated instruments ever exceeded in\r\ndiameter two and one-half inches. Yet, with unwieldy and ungainly\r\ntelescopes, nearly always defining badly, wonders were accomplished by\r\nthe painstaking and indomitable observers of the time.\r\n\r\nIn 1658, Huyghens, using a telescope twenty-three feet long and two\r\nand one-third inches in diameter, with a power of 100, solved the\r\nmystery of Saturn's rings, which had resisted all of Galilei's efforts\r\nas well as his own with a shorter instrument, though he had discovered\r\nTitan, Saturn's largest moon, and fixed correctly its period of\r\nrevolution at sixteen days. Fifteen years later, Ball, with a\r\ntelescope thirty-eight feet long, discovered the principal division in\r\nthe rings. Ten years still later, Cassini, with an instrument twenty\r\nfeet long and an object glass two and one-half inches in diameter,\r\nrediscovered the division, which was named after him, rather than\r\nafter Ball, who had taken no pains to make widely known his discovery,\r\nwhich, in the meantime, had been forgotten. Though we have no record,\r\nthere is no doubt that the lamented Horrocks and Crabtree, in England,\r\nin 1639, with glasses no better than these, watched with exultant\r\nemotions the first transit of Venus ever seen by human eyes.\r\n\r\nIn 1722, Bradley, with a telescope 223¼ feet long, succeeded in\r\nmeasuring the diameter of the same planet. Yet Grant assures us that,\r\nin spite of all their difficulties, such was the industry of the\r\nastronomers that when, at the commencement of this century, it became\r\npossible to construct larger refracting telescopes, there was nothing\r\nto be discovered that could have been discovered with the means at\r\ntheir disposal. So far as we now know, a good three-inch telescope,\r\nnay, a first-rate two inch one, will show far more than our\r\ngreat-grandfathers ever saw, or dreamed of seeing, with their\r\nrefractors.\r\n\r\nToward the middle of the seventeenth century the reflecting telescope\r\nhad been so much improved as nearly to crowd out its refracting rival,\r\nbut, just as its success seemed to be assured, Dollond, working along\r\nlines partially followed up by Hall, found a combination of lenses by\r\nwhich the chromatic aberration of the refractor could be very\r\nperfectly corrected. While Dollond's invention was of immense value,\r\nit remained that flint object glasses larger than two and one-half\r\ninches in diameter could not, for some years, be manufactured, but\r\nabout the opening of the nineteenth century, Guinand, a Swiss,\r\ndiscovered a process of making masses of optical flint glass\r\nsufficiently large as to admit of the construction from them of\r\nexcellent lenses of sizes gradually increasing as time and\r\nexperimenting went on. The making of three-inch objectives, achromatic\r\nand of short focus, wrought a revolution in telescopes and renewed the\r\ndemand for refractors, though prices, as compared with those of the\r\npresent day, were very great. But improvement was succeeded by\r\nimprovement. Larger and still larger objectives were made, yet\r\nprogress was not so rapid as not to justify Grant, in 1852, in\r\ndeclaring to be a \"munificent gift\" the presentation, about 1838, to\r\nGreenwhich Observatory, of a six and seven-tenths object glass alone,\r\nand so it was esteemed by Mr. Airy, the astronomer royal. Improvement\r\nis still the order of the day, and, as a result of keen competition,\r\nvery excellent telescopes of small aperture can be purchased at\r\nreasonable prices. Great telescopes are enormously expensive, and will\r\nprobably be so until they are superseded by some simple invention\r\nwhich shall be as superior to them as they are to the \"mighty\"\r\ninstruments which, from time to time, caused such sensations in the\r\ndays of Galilei, Cassini, Huyghens, Bradley, Dollond, and those who\r\ncame after them.\r\n\r\nBut, notable as are the services rendered to science by giant\r\ntelescopes, it remains that by far the greater bulk of useful work has\r\nbeen done by apertures of less than twelve inches in diameter. Indeed,\r\nit may be asserted that most of such work has been done by instruments\r\nof six inches or less in size. After referring with some detail to\r\nthis, Denning tells us that \"nearly all the comets, planetoids, double\r\nstars, etc., owe their detection to small instruments; that our\r\nknowledge of sun spots, lunar and planetary features is also very\r\nlargely derived from similar sources; that there is no department\r\nwhich is not indebted to the services of small telescopes, and that of\r\nsome thousands of drawings of celestial objects, made by observers\r\nemploying instruments from three to seventy-two inches in diameter, a\r\ncareful inspection shows that the smaller instruments have not been\r\noutdone in this interesting field of observation, owing to their\r\nexcellent defining powers and the facility with which they are used.\"\r\nAperture for aperture, the record is more glorious for the \"common\r\ntelescope\" than for its great rivals. Let us for a moment recall\r\nsomething of what has been done with instruments which may be embraced\r\nunder the designation \"common\" as such a statement may serve to remove\r\nimpressions that small telescopes are but of little use in\r\nastronomical work.\r\n\r\nIn his unrivaled book, Webb declares that his observations were\r\nchiefly made with a telescope five and one-half feet long, carrying an\r\nobject glass of a diameter of three and seven-tenths inches. The\r\ninstrument was of \"fair defining quality,\" and one has but to read his\r\ndelightful pages in order to form an idea of the countless pleasures\r\nWebb derived from observation with it. Speaking of it, he says that\r\nsmaller ones will, of course, do less, especially with faint objects,\r\nbut are often very perfect and distinct, and that even diminutive\r\nglasses, if good, will, at least, show something never seen without\r\nthem. He adds: \"I have a little hand telescope twenty-two and\r\none-quarter inches long, when fully drawn out, with a focus of about\r\nfourteen inches, and one and one-third inches aperture; this, with an\r\nastronomical eye-piece, will show the _existence_ of sun spots, the\r\nmountains in the moon, Jupiter's satellites and Saturn's ring.\" In\r\nanother place, speaking of the sun, he says that an object glass of\r\nonly two inches will exhibit a curdled or marbled appearance over the\r\nwhole solar disk, caused by the intermixture of spaces of different\r\nbrightness. And I may add here that Dawes recommends a small aperture\r\nfor sun work, including spectroscopic examinations, he himself, like\r\nMr. Miller, our librarian, preferring to use for that purpose a four\r\ninch refractor.\r\n\r\nAs you know, the North Star is a most beautiful double. Its companion\r\nis of the ninth order of magnitude, that is, three magnitudes smaller\r\nthan the smallest star visible to the naked eye on a dark night. There\r\nwas a time when Polaris, as a double, was regarded as an excellent\r\ntest for a good three inch telescope; that is any three inch\r\ninstrument in which the companion could be seen was pronounced to be\r\nfirst-class. But so persistently have instruments of small aperture\r\nbeen improved that that star is no longer an absolute test for three\r\ninch objectives of fine quality, or any first-rate objective exceeding\r\ntwo inches for which Dawes proposed it as a standard of excellence, he\r\nhaving found that if the eye and telescope be good, the companion to\r\nPolaris may be seen with such an aperture armed with a power of\r\neighty. As a matter of fact, Dawes, who was, like Burnham, blessed\r\nwith most acute vision, saw the companion with an instrument no larger\r\nthan this small one in my hand--one inch and three-tenths. Ward saw it\r\nwith an inch and one-quarter objective, and Dawson with so small an\r\naperture as one inch. T.T. Smith has seen it with a reflector stopped\r\ndown to one inch and one-quarter, while in the instrument still known\r\nas the \"great Dorpat reflector,\" it has been seen in broad daylight.\r\nThis historic telescope has, I believe, a twelve inch object glass,\r\nbut the difficulty of seeing in sunshine so minute a star is such that\r\nthe fact may fairly be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feature is this. Objects once discovered, though\r\nthought to be visible in large telescopes only, may often be seen in\r\nmuch smaller ones. The first Herschel said truly that less optical\r\npower will show an object than was required for its discovery. The\r\nrifts, or canals, in the Great Nebula in Andromeda is a case in point,\r\nbut two better illustrations may be taken from the planets. Though\r\nSaturn was for many years subjected to most careful scrutiny by\r\nskilled astronomers using the most powerful telescopes in existence,\r\nthe crape ring eluded discovery until November, 1850, when it was\r\nindependently seen by Dawes, in England, and Bond, in the United\r\nStates. Both were capital observers and employed excellent instruments\r\nof large aperture, and it was naturally presumed that only such\r\ninstruments could show the novel Saturnian feature. Not so. Once\r\nbrought to the attention of astronomers, Webb saw the new ring with\r\nhis three and seven-tenths telescope and Ross with an aperture not\r\nexceeding three and three-eighths in diameter. Nay, I am permitted to\r\nsay that a venerable member of this society made drawings of it with a\r\nthree inch refractor. With a two inch objective, Grover not only saw\r\nthe crape ring, but Saturn's belts, as well, and the shadow cast by\r\nthe ball of the planet upon its system of rings. Titan, Saturn's\r\nlargest moon, is merely a point of light as compared with the planet,\r\nas it appears in a telescope, yet it has been seen, so it is said,\r\nwith a one inch glass. The shadow of this satellite, while crossing\r\nthe face of Saturn, has been observed by Banks with a two and\r\nseven-eighths objective. By hiding the glare of the planet behind an\r\nocculting bar, some of Saturn's smallest moons were seen by Kitchener\r\nwith a two and seven-tenths aperture and by Capron with a two and\r\nthree-fourths one. Banks saw four of them with a three and\r\nseven-eighths telescope, Grover two of them with a three and\r\nthree-quarter inch, and four inches of aperture will show five of\r\nthem, so Webb says. Rhea, Dione and Tethys are more minute than\r\nJapetus, yet Cassini, with his inferior means, discerned them and\r\ntraced their periods. Take the instance of Mars next. It was long\r\nbelieved that Mars had no satellites. But in 1877, during one of the\r\nhighly favorable oppositions of that planet which occur but once in\r\nabout sixteen years, the able Hall, using the great 26 inch refractor\r\nat Washington, discovered two tiny moons which had never been seen\r\nbefore. One of these, called Deimos, is only six miles in diameter,\r\nthe other, named Phobos, is only seven, and both are exceedingly close\r\nto the primary and in rapid revolution. The diameter of these\r\nsatellites is really less than the distance from High Park, on the\r\nwest of Toronto, to Woodbine race course, on the east of the city. No\r\nwonder these minute objects--seldom, if ever, nearer to us than about\r\nforty millions of miles--are difficult to see at all. Newcomb and\r\nHolden tell us that they are invisible save at the sixteen year\r\nperiods referred to, when it happens that the earth and Mars, in their\r\nrespective orbits, approach each other more nearly than at any other\r\ntime. But once discovered, the rule held good even in the case of the\r\nsatellites of Mars. Pratt has seen Deimos, the outermost moon, with an\r\neight and one-seventh inch telescope; Erek has seen it with a seven\r\nand one-third inch achromatic; Trouvellot, the innermost one, with a\r\nsix and three-tenths glass, while Common believes that any one who can\r\nmake out Enceladus, one of Saturn's smallest moons, can see those of\r\nMars by hiding the planet at or near the elongations, and that even\r\nour own moonlight does not prevent the observations being made. It\r\nchances for the benefit of observers, in the northern hemisphere\r\nespecially, that one of the sixteen year periods will culminate in\r\n1893, when Mars will be most advantageously situated for close\r\nexamination. No doubt every one will avail himself of the opportunity,\r\nand may we not reasonably hope that scores of amateur observers\r\nthroughout the United States and Canada will experience the delight of\r\nseeing and studying the tiny moons of our ruddy neighbor?\r\n\r\nAnd so I might proceed until I had wearied you with illustrations\r\nshowing what can be done with telescopes so small that they may fairly\r\nbe classed as \"common,\" Webb says that such apertures, with somewhat\r\nhigh powers, will reveal stars down to the eleventh magnitude. The\r\ninteresting celestial objects more conspicuous than stars of that\r\nmagnitude are sufficiently numerous to exhaust much more time than any\r\namateur can give to observing. Indeed, the lot of the amateur is a\r\nhappy one. With a good, though small, telescope, he may have for\r\nsubjects of investigation the sun with his spots, his faculæ, his\r\nprominences and spectra; the moon, a most superb object in nearly\r\nevery optical instrument, with her mountains, valleys, seas, craters,\r\ncones, and ever-changing aspects renewed every month, her occupations\r\nof stars, her eclipses, and all that; the planets, some with phases,\r\nand other with markings, belts, rings, and moons with scores of\r\noccupations, eclipses and transits due to their easily observed\r\nrotation around their primaries; the nebulæ, the double, triple and\r\nmultiple stars with sometimes beautifully contrasted colors, and a\r\nthousand and one other means of amusing and instructing himself.\r\nNature has opened in the heavens as interesting a volume as she has\r\nopened on the earth, and with but little trouble any one may learn to\r\nread in it.\r\n\r\nI trust it has been shown that expensive telescopes are not\r\nnecessarily required for practical work. My advice to an intending\r\npurchaser would be to put into the objective for a refractor, or into\r\nthe mirror for a reflector, all the money he feels warranted in\r\nspending, leaving the mounting to be done in the cheapest possible\r\nmanner consistent with accuracy of adjustment, because it is in the\r\nobjective or in the mirror that the _value_ of the telescope alone\r\nresides. In the shops may be found many telescopes gorgeous in\r\npolished tubes and brass mountings which, for effective work, are\r\nabsolutely worthless. On this subject, I consulted the most eminent of\r\nall discoverers of double stars, an observer who, even as an amateur,\r\nmade a glorious reputation by the work done with a six inch telescope.\r\nI refer to Mr. S.W. Burnham, of the Lick Observatory, who, in reply,\r\nkindly wrote: \"You will certainly have no difficulty in making out a\r\nstrong case in favor of the use of small telescopes in many\r\ndepartments of important astronomical work. Most of the early\r\ntelescopic work was done with instruments which would now be\r\nconsidered as inferior to modern instruments, in quality as well as in\r\nsize. You are doubtless familiar with much of the amateur work, in\r\nthis country and elsewhere, done with comparatively small apertures.\r\n_The most important condition is to have the refractor_, whatever its\r\nsize may be, _of the highest optical perfection_, and then the rest\r\nwill depend on the zeal and industry of the observer.\" The italics are\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it may be mentioned that much most interesting work may\r\nbe done even with an opera glass, as a few minutes' systematic\r\nobservation on any fine night will prove. Newcomb and Holden assure us\r\nthat \"if Hipparchus had had even such an optical instrument, mankind\r\nneed not have waited two thousand years to know the nature of the\r\nMilky Way, nor would it have required a Galilei to discover the phases\r\nof Venus or the spots on the sun.\" To amplify the thought, if that\r\nmighty geometer and observer and some of his contemporaries had\r\npossessed but the \"common telescope,\" is it not probable that in the\r\nscience of astronomy the world would have been to-day two thousand\r\nyears in advance of its present position?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHÆOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES AT CADIZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have had the good fortune to visit Andalusia, that\r\nprivileged land of the sun, of light, songs, dances, beautiful girls,\r\nand bull fighters, preserve, among many other poetical and pleasing\r\nrecollections, that of election to antique and smiling Cadiz--the\r\n\"pearl of the ocean and the silver cup,\" as the Andalusians say in\r\ntheir harmonious and imaginative language. There is, in fact, nothing\r\nexaggerated in these epithets, for they translate a true impression.\r\nEspecially if we arrive by sea, there is nothing so thrilling as the\r\ndazzling silhouette which, from afar, is reflected all white from the\r\nmirror of a gulf almost always blue.\r\n\r\nThe Cadiz peninsula has for centuries been legitimately renowned, for,\r\nturn by turn, Phenicians, properly so called, Carthaginians, Romans,\r\nGoths, Arabs and Spaniards have made of it the preferred seat of their\r\nbusiness and pleasure. In his so often unsparing verses, Martial,\r\neven, celebrates with an erotic rapture the undulating suppleness of\r\nthe ballet dancers of _Gades_, who are continued in our day by the\r\n_majas_ and _chulas_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHENICIAN TOMBS DISCOVERED AT CADIZ.]\r\n\r\nFor an epoch anterior to that of the Latin poet, we have the\r\ntestimony, among others, of Strabo, who describes the splendors,\r\nformerly and for a long time famous, of the temple of Hercules, and\r\nwho gives many details, whose accuracy can still be verified,\r\nconcerning various questions of topography or ethnography. Thus the\r\nsuperb tree called _Dracæna draco_ is mentioned as growing in the\r\nvicinity of _Gadeira_, the Greek name of the city. Now, some of these\r\ntrees still exist in certain public and private gardens, and attract\r\nso much the more attention in that they are not met with in any other\r\nEuropean country. However, although historically Cadiz finds her title\r\nto nobility on every page of the Greek and Latin authors, and although\r\nher Phenician origin is averred, nowhere has such origin, in a\r\nmonumental and epigraphic sense, left fewer traces than in the\r\nAndalusian peninsula. A few short legends, imperfectly read upon\r\neither silver or bronze coins, and that was all, at least up to recent\r\ntimes. Such penury as this distressed savants and even put them into\r\npretty bad humor with the Cadiz archæologists.\r\n\r\nTo-day, it seems that the ancient Semitic civilization, which has\r\nremained mute for so long in the Iberic territory, is finally willing\r\nto yield up her secret, as is proved by the engravings which we\r\npresent to our readers from photographs taken _in situ_. It is\r\nnecessary for us to enter into some details.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 there were met with at the gates of Cadiz, at about five\r\nmeters beneath the surface of the earth, three rude tombs of shelly\r\nlimestone, in which were found some skeletons, a few small bronze\r\ninstruments and some trinkets--the latter of undoubted oriental\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nIn one of these tombs was also inclosed a monolithic sarcophagus of\r\nwhite marble of the form called anthropoid and measuring 2.15 m. in\r\nlength by 0.67 in width. This sarcophagus is now preserved in the\r\nlocal museum, whose director is the active, intelligent and\r\ndisinterested Father Vera. Although this is not the place to furnish\r\ntechnical or scientific explanations, it will be permitted us to point\r\nout the fact that although it is of essentially oriental manufacture,\r\nour anthropoid has undoubtedly undergone the Hellenistic influence,\r\nwhich implies an epoch posterior to that of Pericles, who died in 429\r\nB.C. The personage represented, a man of mature age with noble\r\nlineaments and aquiline nose, has thick hair corned up on the forehead\r\nin the form of a crown, and a beard plaited in the Asiatic fashion. As\r\nfor the head, which is almost entirely executed in round relief, that\r\ndenotes in an undoubted manner the Hellenistic influence, united,\r\nhowever, with the immutable and somewhat hierarchical traditions of\r\nPhenician art. The arms are naked as far as to the elbow, and the\r\nfeet, summarily indicated, emerge from a long sheath-form robe. As for\r\nthe arms and hands, they project slightly and are rather outlined than\r\nsculptured. The left hand grasps a fruit, the emblem of fecundity,\r\nwhile the right held a painted crown, the traces of which have now\r\nentirely disappeared. It suffices to look at this sarcophagus to\r\nrecognize the exclusively Phenician character of it, and the complete\r\nanalogy with the monuments of the same species met with in Phenicia,\r\nin Cyprus, in Sicily, in Malta, in Sardinia, and everywhere where were\r\nestablished those of Tyre and Sidon, but never until now in Spain.\r\n\r\nOn another hand, for those of our readers who are interested in\r\narchæology, we believe it our duty to point out as a source of\r\ninformation a memoir published last year by our National Society of\r\nAntiquaries. Let us limit ourselves, therefore, to fixing attention\r\nupon one important point: The marble anthropoid was protected by a\r\ntomb absolutely like the rude tombs contiguous to it.\r\n\r\nThe successive discoveries since the third of last January at nearly\r\nthe same place, and at a depth of from 3 to 6 meters beneath the\r\nsurface, of numerous _Inculi_ absolutely identical as to material and\r\nstructure with those of which we have just spoken, is therefore a\r\nscientific event of high importance. Those discoveries, which were\r\npurely accidental, were brought about by the work on the foundations\r\nof the Maritime Arsenal now in course of construction at the gates of\r\nCadiz. Our Fig. 1 represents the unearthing of the _loculi_ on the\r\n14th of April, and on the value of which there is no need to dwell. As\r\nto the dimensions, it is easy to judge of these, since the laborer\r\nstanding to the left of the spectator holds in his hand a meter\r\nmeasure serving as a scale. It will suffice to state that the depth of\r\neach tomb is about two meters, and that upon the lower part of three\r\nof the parallelopipeds there exist pavements of crucial appearance.\r\nFinally, nothing denoted externally the existence of these sarcophagi\r\njealously hidden from investigation according to a usage that is\r\nestablished especially by the imprecations graven upon the basaltic\r\ncasket now preserved in the Museum of the Louvre, and which contained\r\nthe ashes of Eshmanazar, King of Sidon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTHROPOID SARCOPHAGUS DISCOVERED AT CADIZ.]\r\n\r\nSpace is wanting to furnish ampler information. Our object is simply\r\nto call attention to a zone which is somewhat neglected from a\r\nscientific point of view, and which, however, seems as if it ought to\r\noffer a valuable field of investigation to students of things Semitic,\r\namong whom, as well known, our compatriots hold a rank apart, since it\r\nis to them that falls the laborious and very honorable duty of\r\ncollecting and editing the inscriptions in Semitic languages.\r\n\r\nOn another hand, although in the beginning the sepulchers were taken\r\nto pieces and carried away (two of them imperfectly reconstructed may\r\nbe seen in the garden of the Cadizian Museum), there will be an\r\nopportunity of making prevail the system of maintaining _in situ_ the\r\nvarious monuments that may hereafter be discovered. Thus only could\r\none, at a given moment, obtain an accurate idea of what the Phenician\r\nnecropolis of Cadiz was, and allow the structures that compose it to\r\npreserve their imposing stamp of rustic indestructibility.\r\n\r\nThe excavation is being carried on at this very moment, and a bronze\r\nstatuette of an oriental god and various trinkets of more or less\r\nvalue have just enriched the municipal collection. Let us hope, then,\r\nas was recently predicted by Mr. Clermont Ganneau, of the Institute,\r\nthat some day or another some Semitic inscription will throw a last\r\nray of light upon the past, which is at present so imperfectly known,\r\nof Phenician Cadiz.--_L'Illustration._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREHISTORIC HORSE IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American_:\r\n\r\nApropos to Professor Cope's remarks before the A.A.A.S. at Washington,\r\nreported in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, September 12, inclose sketch of a\r\nmounted man, whether on a horse or some other mammal, is a question\r\nopen to criticism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Height, 43 in.; length, 63 in.

Then Lake Managua's outlet at Fipitapa ceased its\r\nusual supply of water to Lake Nicaragua. When notified of the\r\ndiscovery the spot was under water. Only one of the very large teeth\r\nwas given to me, which was forwarded to Prof. Baird, of\r\nSmithsonian--Private No. 34.\r\n\r\nWhen Lake Nicaragua was an ocean inlet, its track extended to foot\r\nhills northward. Its waterworn pebbles and small bowlders were\r\nsubsequently covered by lake deposit, during the time between the\r\ninclosure and break out at San Carlos. In this deposit around the lake\r\n(now dry) fossil bones occur--elephas, megatherium, horse, etc. The\r\nlarge alluvium plains north of lake, cut through by rivers, allow\r\nthese bones to settle on their rocky beds. This deposit is of greater\r\ndepth in places west of lake.\r\n\r\nNow, if we suppose these animals were exterminated in glacial times,\r\nit remains for us to show when this was consummated.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the lake deposit and exposure no new proofs of its\r\ncontinuance are found.\r\n\r\n1. This deposit occurred after the coast range was elevated.\r\n\r\n2. Elevation was caused by a volcanic ash eruption, 5 or 6 of a\r\nseries.

Old river emptying into Lake Managua reveals fossil bones; moraines\r\neast of it are found.\r\n\r\nFrom these data we see the glacial action was prior to the sedimentary\r\nrock here, and had spent its force when elevation of coast range\r\noccurred. No nearer estimate is possible.\r\n\r\nAs the fossil horse occurs here, our mounted man may have domesticated\r\nhim, and afterward slaughtered for food like the modern Frenchman.\r\nUnfortunately Prof. Cope did not find a similar inscription.\r\n\r\nEARL FLINT.\r\nRivas, Nicaragua, October 27, 1891.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER RESEARCHES UPON THE ELEMENT FLUORINE.\r\n\r\nBy A.E. TUTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the publication by M. Moissan of his celebrated paper in the\r\n_Annales de Chimîe et de Physique_ for December, 1887, describing the\r\nmanner in which he had succeeded in isolating this remarkable gaseous\r\nelement, a considerable amount of additional information has been\r\nacquired concerning the chemical behavior of fluorine, and important\r\nadditions and improvements have been introduced in the apparatus\r\nemployed for preparing and experimenting with the gas. M. Moissan now\r\ngathers together the results of these subsequent researches--some of\r\nwhich have been published by him from time to time as contributions to\r\nvarious French scientific journals, while others have not hitherto\r\nbeen made known--and publishes them in a long but most interesting\r\npaper in the October number of the _Annales de Chimîe et de Physique._\r\nInasmuch as the experiments described are of so extraordinary a\r\nnature, owing to the intense chemical activity of fluorine, and are so\r\nimportant as filling a long existing vacancy in our chemical\r\nliterature, readers of _Nature_ will doubtless be interested in a\r\nbrief account of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED APPARATUS FOR PREPARING FLUORINE.\r\n\r\nIn his paper of 1887, the main outlines of which were given in\r\n_Nature_ at the time (1887, vol. xxxvii., p. 179), M. Moissan showed\r\nthat pure hydrofluoric acid readily dissolves the double fluoride of\r\npotassium and hydrogen, and that the liquid thus obtained is a good\r\nconductor of electricity, rendering electrolysis possible. It will be\r\nremembered that, by passing a strong current of electricity through\r\nthis liquid contained in a platinum apparatus, free gaseous fluorine\r\nwas obtained at the positive pole and hydrogen at the negative pole.\r\nThe amount of hydrofluoric acid employed in these earlier experiments\r\nwas about fifteen grms., about six grms. of hydrogen potassium\r\nfluoride, HF.KF, being added in order to render it a conductor. Since\r\nthe publication of that memoir a much larger apparatus has been\r\nconstructed, in order to obtain the gas in greater quantity for the\r\nstudy of its reactions, and important additions have been made, by\r\nmeans of which the fluorine is delivered in a pure state, free from\r\nadmixed vapor of the very volatile hydrofluoric acid. As much as a\r\nhundred cubic centimeters of hydrofluoric acid, together with twenty\r\ngrms. of the dissolved double fluoride, are submitted to electrolysis\r\nin this new apparatus, and upward of four liters of pure fluorine is\r\ndelivered by it per hour.\r\n\r\nThis improved form of the apparatus is shown in the accompanying\r\nfigure (Fig. 1), which is reproduced from the memoir of M. Moissan. It\r\nconsists essentially of two parts--the electrolysis apparatus and the\r\npurifying vessels. The electrolysis apparatus, a sectional view of\r\nwhich is given in Fig. 2, is similar in form to that described in the\r\npaper of 1887, but much larger.\r\n\r\nThe U-tube of platinum has a capacity of 160 c.c. It is fitted with\r\ntwo lateral delivery tubes of platinum, as in the earlier form, and\r\nwith stoppers of fluorspar, F, inserted in cylinders of platinum, _p_,\r\ncarrying screw threads, which engage with similar threads upon the\r\ninterior surfaces of the limbs of the U-tube. A key of brass, E,\r\nserves to screw or unscrew the stoppers, and between the flange of\r\neach stopper and the top of each branch of the U-tube a ring of lead\r\nis compressed, by which means hermetic closing is effected. These\r\nfluorspar stoppers, which are covered with a coating of gum lac during\r\nthe electrolysis, carry the electrode rods, _t_, which are thus\r\nperfectly insulated. M. Moissan now employs electrodes of pure\r\nplatinum instead of irido-platinum, and the interior end of each is\r\nthickened into a club shape in order the longer to withstand\r\ncorrosion. The apparatus is immersed during the electrolysis in a bath\r\nof liquid methyl chloride, maintained in tranquil ebullition at -23°.\r\nIn order to preserve the methyl chloride as long as possible, the\r\ncylinder containing it is placed in an outer glass cylinder containing\r\nfragments of calcium chloride; by this means it is surrounded with a\r\nlayer of dry air, a bad conductor of heat.\r\n\r\nThe purifying vessels are three in number. The first consists of a\r\nplatinum spiral worm-tube of about 40 c.c. capacity, immersed also in\r\na bath of liquid methyl chloride, maintained at as low a temperature\r\nas possible, about -50°. As hydrofluoric acid boils at 19.5°\r\n(Moissan), almost the whole of the vapor of this substance which is\r\ncarried away in the stream of issuing fluorine is condensed and\r\nretained at the bottom of the worm. To remove the last traces of\r\nhydrofluoric acid, advantage is taken of the fact that fused sodium\r\nfluoride combines with the free acid with great energy to form the\r\ndouble fluoride HF.NaF. Sodium fluoride also possesses the advantage\r\nof not attracting moisture. After traversing the worm condenser,\r\ntherefore, the fluorine is caused to pass through two platinum tubes\r\nfilled with fragments of fused sodium fluoride, from which it issues\r\nin an almost perfect state of purity. The junctions between the\r\nvarious parts of the apparatus are effected by means of screw joints,\r\nbetween the nuts and flanges of which collars of lead are compressed.\r\nDuring the electrolysis these leaden collars become, where exposed to\r\nthe gaseous fluorine, rapidly converted into lead fluoride, which\r\nbeing greater in bulk causes the joints to become hermetically sealed.\r\nIn order to effect the electrolysis, twenty-six to twenty-eight Bunsen\r\nelements are employed, arranged in series. An ampere meter and a\r\ncommutator are introduced between the battery and the electrolysis\r\napparatus; the former affording an excellent indication of the\r\nprogress of the electrolysis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--FLUORINE APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nAs the U-tube contains far more hydrofluoric acid than can be used in\r\none day, each lateral delivery tube is fitted with a metallic screw\r\nstopper, so that the experiments may be discontinued at any time, and\r\nthe apparatus closed. The whole electrolysis vessel is then placed\r\nunder a glass bell jar containing dry air, and kept in a refrigerator\r\nuntil again required for use. In this way it may be preserved full of\r\nacid for several weeks, ready at any time for the preparation of the\r\ngas. Considerable care requires to be exercised not to admit the vapor\r\nof methyl chloride into the U-tube, as otherwise violent detonations\r\nare liable to occur. When the liquid methyl chloride is being\r\nintroduced into the cylinder, the whole apparatus becomes surrounded\r\nwith an atmosphere of its vapor, and as the platinum U-tube is at the\r\nsame instant suddenly cooled the vapor is liable to enter by the\r\nabducting tubes. Consequently, as soon as the current is allowed to\r\npass and fluorine is liberated within the U-tube, an explosion occurs.\r\nFluorine instantly decomposes methyl chloride, with production of\r\nflame and formation of fluorides of hydrogen and carbon, liberation of\r\nchlorine, and occasionally deposition of carbon. In order to avoid\r\nthis unpleasant occurrence, when the methyl chloride is being\r\nintroduced the ends of the lateral delivery tubes are attached to long\r\nlengths of caoutchoue tubing, supplied at their ends with calcium\r\nchloride drying tubes, so as to convey dry air from outside the\r\natmosphere of methyl chloride vapor. If great care is taken to obtain\r\nthe minimum temperature, this difficulty may be even more simply\r\novercome by employing a mixture of well pounded ice and salt instead\r\nof methyl chloride; but there is the counterbalancing disadvantage to\r\nbe considered, that such a cooling bath requires much more frequent\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL REACTIONS OCCURRING DURING THE ELECTROLYSIS.\r\n\r\nIn the paper of 1887, M. Moissan adopted the view that the first\r\naction of the electric current was to effect the decomposition of the\r\npotassium fluoride contained in solution in the hydrofluoric acid,\r\nfluorine being liberated at the positive pole and potassium at the\r\nnegative terminal. This liberated potassium would at once regenerate\r\npotassium fluoride in presence of hydrofluoric acid, and liberate its\r\nequivalent of hydrogen:\r\n\r\n      KF = K + F.\r\n  K + HF = KF + H.\r\n\r\nBut when the progress of the electrolysis is carefully followed, by\r\nconsulting the indications of the amperemeter placed in circuit, it is\r\nfound to be by no means as regular as the preceding formulæ would\r\nindicate. With the new apparatus, the decomposition is quite irregular\r\nat first, and does not attain regularity until it has been proceeding\r\nfor upward of two hours. Upon stopping the current and unmounting the\r\napparatus, the platinum rod upon which the fluorine was liberated is\r\nfound to be largely corroded, and at the bottom of the U-tube a\r\nquantity of a black, finely divided substance is observed. This black\r\nsubstance, which was taken at first to be metallic platinum, is a\r\ncomplex compound containing one equivalent of potassium to one\r\nequivalent of platinum, together with a considerable proportion of\r\nfluorine.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the hydrofluoric acid is found to contain a small quantity\r\nof platinum fluoride in solution. The electrolytic reaction is\r\nprobably therefore much more complicated than was at first considered\r\nto be the case. The mixture of acid and alkaline fluoride furnishes\r\nfluorine at the positive terminal rod, but this intensely active gas,\r\nin its nascent state, attacks the platinum and produces platinum\r\ntetrafluoride, PtF_{4}; this probably unites with the potassium\r\nfluoride to form a double salt, possibly 2Kl.PtF_{4}, analogous to the\r\nwell known platinochloride 2KCl.PtCl_{4}; and it is only when the\r\nliquid contains this double salt that the electrolysis proceeds in a\r\nregular manner, yielding free fluorine at the positive pole, and\r\nhydrogen and the complex black compound at the negative pole.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUORINE.\r\n\r\nFluorine possesses an odor which M. Moissan compares to a mixture of\r\nhypochlorous acid and nitrogen peroxide, but this odor is usually\r\nmasked by that of the ozone which it always produces in moist air,\r\nowing to its decomposition of the water vapor. It produces most\r\nserious irritation of the bronchial tubes and mucous membrane of the\r\nnasal cavities, the effects of which are persistent for quite a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nWhen examined in a thickness of one meter, it is seen to possess a\r\ngreenish yellow color, but paler, and containing more of yellow, than\r\nthat of chlorine. In such a layer, fluorine does not present any\r\nabsorption bands. Its spectrum exhibits thirteen bright, lines in the\r\nred, between wave lengths 744 and 623. Their positions and relative\r\nintensities are as follows:\r\n\r\n[lambda] = 744 very feeble.    |     [lambda] = 685.5  feeble\r\n           740      \"          |                683.5    \"\r\n           734      \"          |                677    strong\r\n           714 feeble.         |                640.5    \"\r\n           704      \"          |                634      \"\r\n           691      \"          |                623      \"\r\n           687.5    \"          |\r\n\r\nAt a temperature of -95° at ordinary atmospheric pressure, fluorine\r\nremains gaseous, no sign of liquefaction having been observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF EXPERIMENTING WITH FLUORINE.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to determine the action of fluorine upon a solid\r\nsubstance, the following method of procedure is adopted. A preliminary\r\nexperiment is first made, in order to obtain some idea as to the\r\ndegree of energy of the reaction, by bringing a little of the solid,\r\nplaced upon the lid of a platinum crucible held in a pair of tongs,\r\nnear the mouth of the delivery tube of the preparation apparatus. If a\r\ngaseous or liquid product results, and it is desirable to collect it\r\nfor examination, small fragments of the solid are placed in a platinum\r\ntube connected to the delivery tube by flexible platinum tubing or by\r\na screw joint, and the resulting gas may be collected over water or\r\nmercury, or the liquid condensed in a cooled cylinder of platinum. In\r\nthis manner the action of fluorine upon sulphur and iodine has been\r\nstudied. If the solid, phosphorus for instance, attacks platinum, or\r\nthe temperature of the reaction is sufficiently high to determine the\r\ncombination of platinum and fluorine (toward 500°), a tube of\r\nfluorspar is substituted for the platinum tube. The fluorspar tubes\r\nemployed by M. Moissan for the study of the action of phosphorus were\r\nabout twelve to fourteen centimeters long, and were terminated by\r\nplatinum ends furnished with flanges and screw threads in order to be\r\nable to connect them with the preparation apparatus. If it is required\r\nto heat the fluorspar tubes, they are surrounded by a closely wound\r\ncopper spiral, which may be heated by a Bunsen flame.\r\n\r\nIn experimenting upon liquids, great care is necessary, as the\r\nreaction frequently occurs with explosive violence. A preliminary\r\nexperiment is therefore always made, by allowing the fluorine delivery\r\ntube to dip just beneath the surface of the liquid contained in a\r\nsmall glass cylinder. When the liquid contains water, or when\r\nhydrofluoric acid is a product of the reaction, cylinders of platinum\r\nor of fluorspar are employed. If it is required to collect and examine\r\nthe product, the liquid is placed along the bottom of a horizontal\r\ntube of platinum or fluorspar, as in case of solids, connected\r\ndirectly with the preparation apparatus, and the product is collected\r\nover water or mercury if a gas, or in a cooled platinum receiver if a\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nDuring the examination of liquids a means has accidentally been\r\ndiscovered by which a glass tube may be filled with fluorine gas. A\r\nfew liquids, one of which is carbon tetrachloride, react only very\r\nslowly with fluorine at the ordinary temperature. By filling a glass\r\ntube with such a liquid, and inverting it over a platinum capsule also\r\ncontaining the liquid, it is possible to displace the liquid by\r\nfluorine, which, as the walls are wet, does not attack the glass. Or\r\nthe glass tube may be filled with the liquid, and then the latter\r\npoured out, leaving the walls wet; the tube may then be filled with\r\nfluorine gas, which being slightly heavier than air, remains in the\r\ntube for some time. In one experiment, in which a glass test tube had\r\nbeen filled with fluorine over carbon tetrachloride, it was attempted\r\nto transfer it to a graduated tube over mercury, but in inclining the\r\ntest tube for this purpose the mercury suddenly came in contact with\r\nthe fluorine, and absorbed it so instantaneously and with such a\r\nviolent detonation that both the test tube and the graduated tube were\r\nshattered into fragments. Indeed, owing to the powerful affinity of\r\nmercury for fluorine, it is a most dangerous experiment to transfer a\r\ntube containing fluorine gas, filled according to either the first or\r\nsecond method, to the mercury trough; the tube is always shattered if\r\nthe mercury comes in contact with the gas, and generally with a loud\r\ndetonation. Fluorine may, however, be preserved for some time in tubes\r\nover mercury, provided a few drops of the non-reacting liquid are kept\r\nabove the mercury meniscus.\r\n\r\nFor studying the action of fluorine on gases, a special piece of\r\napparatus, shown in Fig. 3, has been constructed. It is composed of a\r\ntube of platinum, fifteen centimeters long, closed by two plates of\r\nclear, transparent, and colorless fluorspar, and carrying three\r\nlateral narrower tubes also of platinum. Two of these tubes face each\r\nother in the center of the apparatus, and serve one for the conveyance\r\nof the fluorine and the other of the gas to be experimented upon. The\r\nthird, which is of somewhat greater diameter than the other two,\r\nserves as exit tube for the product or products of the reaction, and\r\nmay be placed in connection with a trough containing either water or\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is first filled with the gas to be experimented upon,\r\nthen the fluorine is allowed to enter, and an observation of what\r\noccurs may be made through the fluorspar windows. One most important\r\nprecaution to take in collecting the gaseous products over mercury is\r\nnot to permit the platinum delivery tube to dip more than two or at\r\nmost three millimeters under the mercury, as otherwise the levels of\r\nthe liquid in the two limbs of the electrolysis U-tube become so\r\ndifferent, owing to the pressure, that the fluorine from one side\r\nmixes with the hydrogen evolved upon the other, and there is a violent\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF FLUORINE UPON THE NON-METALLIC ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n_Hydrogen._--As just described, hydrogen combines with fluorine, even\r\nat -23° and in the dark, with explosive force. This is the only case\r\nin which two elementary gases unite directly without the intervention\r\nof extraneous energy. If the end of the tube delivering fluorine is\r\nplaced in an atmosphere of hydrogen, a very hot blue flame, bordered\r\nwith red, at once appears at the mouth of the tube, and vapor of\r\nhydrofluoric acid is produced.\r\n\r\n_Oxygen._--Fluorine has not been found capable of uniting with oxygen\r\nup to a temperature of 500°. On ozone, however, it appears to exert\r\nsome action, as will be evident from the following experiment. It was\r\nshown in 1887 that fluorine decomposes water, forming hydrofluoric\r\nacid, and liberating oxygen in the form of ozone. When a few drops of\r\nwater are placed in the apparatus shown in Fig. 3, and fluorine\r\nallowed to enter, the water is instantly decomposed, and on looking\r\nthrough the fluorspar ends a thick dark cloud is seen over the spot\r\nwhere each drop of water had previously been. This cloud soon\r\ndiminishes in intensity, and is eventually replaced by a beautiful\r\nblue gas--ozone in a state of considerable density. If the product is\r\nchased out by a stream of nitrogen as soon as the dense cloud is\r\nformed, a very strong odor is perceived, different from that of either\r\nfluorine or ozone, but which soon gives place to the unmistakable odor\r\nof ozone. It appears as if there is at first produced an unstable\r\noxide of fluorine, which rapidly decomposes into fluorine and ozone.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen_ and _chlorine_ appear not to react with fluorine.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur._--In contact with fluorine gas, sulphur rapidly melts and\r\ninflames. A gaseous fluoride of sulphur is formed, which possesses a\r\nmost penetrating odor, somewhat resembling that of chloride of\r\nsulphur. The gas is incombustible, even in oxygen. When warmed in a\r\nglass vessel, the latter becomes etched, owing to the formation of\r\nsilicon tetrafluoride, SiF_{4}. Selenium and tellurium behave\r\nsimilarly, but form crystalline solid fluorides.\r\n\r\n_Bromine_ vapor combines with fluorine in the cold with production of\r\na very bright but low temperature dame. If the fluorine is evolved in\r\nthe midst of pure dry liquid bromine, the combination is immediate,\r\nand occurs without flame.\r\n\r\n_Iodine._--When fluorine is passed over a fragment of iodine contained\r\nin the horizontal tube, combination occurs, with production of a pale\r\nflame. A very heavy liquid, colorless when free from dissolved iodine,\r\nand fuming strongly in the air, condenses in the cooled receiver. This\r\nliquid fluoride of iodine attacks glass with great energy and\r\ndecomposes water when dropped into that liquid with a noise like that\r\nproduced by red-hot iron. Its properties agree with those of the\r\nfluoride of iodine prepared by Gore by the action of iodine on silver\r\nfluoride.\r\n\r\n_Phosphorus._--Immediately phosphorus, either the ordinary yellow\r\nvariety or red phosphorus, comes in contact with fluorine, a most\r\nlively action occurs, accompanied by vivid incandescence. If the\r\nfluorine is in excess, a fuming gas is evolved, which gives up its\r\nexcess of fluorine on collecting over mercury, and is soluble in\r\nwater. This gas is phosphorus pentafluoride, PF_{5}, prepared some\r\nyears ago by Prof. Thorpe. If, on the contrary, the phosphorus is in\r\nexcess, a gaseous mixture of this pentafluoride with a new fluoride,\r\nthe trifluoride, PF_{3}, a gas insoluble in water, but which may be\r\nabsorbed by caustic potash, is obtained. The trifluoride, in turn,\r\ncombines with more fluorine to form the pentafluoride, the reaction\r\nbeing accompanied by the appearance of a flame of comparatively low\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n_Arsenic_ combines with fluorine at the ordinary temperature with\r\nincandescence. If the current of fluorine is fairly rapid, a colorless\r\nfuming liquid condenses in the receiver, which is mainly arsenic\r\ntrifluoride, AsF_{3}, but which appears also to contain a new\r\nfluoride, the pentafluoride, AsF_{5}, inasmuch as the solution in\r\nwater yields the reactions of both arsenious and arsenic acids.\r\n\r\n_Carbon._--Chlorine does not unite with carbon even at the high\r\ntemperature of the electric arc, but fluorine reacts even at the\r\nordinary temperature with finely divided carbon. Purified lampblack\r\ninflames instantly with great brilliancy, as do also the lighter\r\nvarieties of wood charcoal. A curious phenomenon is noticed with wood\r\ncharcoal; it appears at first to absorb and condense the fluorine,\r\nthen quite suddenly it bursts into flame with bright scintillations.\r\nThe denser varieties of charcoal require warming to 50° or 60° before\r\nthey inflame, but it once the combustion is started at any point it\r\nrapidly propagates itself throughout the entire piece. Graphite must\r\nbe heated to just below dull redness in order to effect combination;\r\nwhile the diamond has not yet been attacked by fluorine, even at the\r\ntemperature of the Bunsen flame. A mixture of gaseous fluorides of\r\ncarbon are produced whenever carbon of any variety is acted upon by\r\nfluorine, the predominating constituent being the tetrafluoride,\r\nCF_{4}.\r\n\r\n_Boron._--The amorphous variety of boron inflames instantly in\r\nfluorine, with projection of brilliant sparks and liberation of dense\r\nfumes of boron trifluoride, BF_{3}. The adamantine modification\r\nbehaves similarly if powdered. When the experiment is performed in the\r\nfluorspar tube, the gaseous fluoride may be collected over mercury.\r\nThe gas fumes strongly in the air, and is instantly decomposed by\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Silicon._--The reaction between fluorine and silicon is one of the\r\nmost beautiful of all these extraordinary manifestations of chemical\r\nactivity. The cold crystals become immediately white-hot, and the\r\nsilicon burns with a very hot flame, scattering showers of star-like,\r\nwhite-hot particles in all directions. If the action is stopped before\r\nall the silicon is consumed, the residue is found to be fused. As\r\ncrystalline silicon only melts at a temperature superior to 1,200°,\r\nthe heat evolved must be very great. If the reaction is performed in\r\nthe fluorspar tube, the resulting gaseous silicon tetrafluoride,\r\nSiF_{4}, may be collected over mercury.\r\n\r\nAmorphous silicon likewise burns with great energy in fluorine.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF FLUORINE UPON METALS.\r\n\r\n_Sodium_ and _potassium_ combine with fluorine with great vigor at\r\nordinary temperatures, becoming incandescent, and forming their\r\nrespective fluorides, which may be obtained crystallized from water in\r\ncubes. Metallic _calcium_ also burns in fluorine gas, forming the\r\nfused fluoride, and occasionally minute crystals of fluorspar.\r\n_Thallium_ is rapidly converted to fluoride at ordinary temperatures,\r\nthe temperature rising until the metal melts and finally becomes red\r\nhot. Powdered _magnesium_ burns with great brilliancy. _Iron_, reduced\r\nby hydrogen, combines in the cold with immediate incandescence, and\r\nformation of an anhydrous, readily soluble, white fluoride.\r\n_Aluminum_, on heating to low redness, gives a very beautiful\r\nluminosity, as do also _chromium_ and _manganese_. The combustion of\r\nslightly warmed zinc in fluorine is particularly pretty as an\r\nexperiment, the flame being of a most dazzling whiteness. _Antimony_\r\ntakes fire at the ordinary temperature, and forms a solid white\r\nfluoride. _Lead_ and _mercury_ are attacked in the cold, as previously\r\ndescribed, the latter with great rapidity. _Copper_ reacts at low\r\nredness, but in a strangely feeble manner, and the white fumes formed\r\nappear to combine with a further quantity of fluorine to form a\r\nperfluoride. The main product is a volatile white fluoride. _Silver_\r\nis only slowly attacked in the cold. When heated, however, to 100°,\r\nthe metal commences to be covered with a yellow coat of anhydrous\r\nfluoride, and on heating to low redness combination occurs, with\r\nincandescence, and the resulting fluoride becomes fused, and afterward\r\npresents a satin-like aspect. _Gold_ becomes converted into a yellow\r\ndeliquescent volatile fluoride when heated to low redness, and at a\r\nslightly higher temperature the fluoride is dissociated into metallic\r\ngold and fluorine gas.\r\n\r\nThe action of fluorine on _platinum_ has been studied with special\r\ncare. It is evident, in view of the corrosion of the positive platinum\r\nterminal of the electrolysis apparatus, that nascent fluorine rapidly\r\nattacks platinum at a temperature of -23°. At 100°, however, fluorine\r\ngas appears to be without action on platinum. At 500°-600° it is\r\nattacked strongly, with formation of the tetrafluoride. PtF_{4}, and a\r\nsmall quantity of the protofluoride, PtF_{2}. If the fluorine is\r\nadmixed with vapor of hydrofluoric acid, the reaction is much more\r\nvigorous, as if a fluorhydrate of the tetrafluoride, perhaps\r\n2HF.PtF_{4}, were formed. The tetrafluoride is generally found in the\r\nform of deep-red fused masses, or small yellow crystals resembling\r\nthose of anhydrous platinum chloride. The salt is volatile and very\r\nhygroscopic. Its behavior with water is peculiar. With a small\r\nquantity of water a brownish yellow solution is formed, which,\r\nhowever, in a very short time becomes warm and the fluoride\r\ndecomposes; platinic hydrate is precipitated, and free hydrofluoric\r\nacid remains in solution. If the quantity of water is greater, the\r\nsolution may be preserved for some minutes without decomposition. If\r\nthe liquid is boiled, it decomposes instantly. At a red heat platinic\r\nfluoride decomposes into metallic platinum and fluorine, which is\r\nevolved in the free state. This reaction can therefore be employed as\r\na ready means of preparing fluorine, the fluoride only requiring to be\r\nheated rapidly to redness in a platinum tube closed at one end, when\r\ncrystallized silicon held at the open end will be found to immediately\r\ntake fire in the escaping fluorine. The best mode of obtaining the\r\nfluoride of platinum for this purpose is to heat a bundle of platinum\r\nwires to low redness in the fluorspar reaction tube in a rapid stream\r\nof fluorine. As soon as sufficient fluoride is formed on the wires,\r\nthey are transferred to a well stoppered dry glass tube, until\r\nrequired for the preparation of fluorine.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF FLUORINE UPON NON-METALLIC COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\n_Sulphureted Hydrogen._--When the horizontal tube shown in Fig. 3 is\r\nfilled with sulphureted hydrogen gas and fluorine is allowed to enter,\r\na blue flame is observed on looking through the fluorspar windows\r\nplaying around the spot where the fluorine is being admitted. The\r\ndecomposition continues until the whole of the hydrogen sulphide is\r\nconverted into gaseous fluorides of hydrogen and sulphur.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur dioxide_ is likewise decomposed in the cold, with production\r\nof a yellow flame and formation of fluoride of sulphur.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochloric acid_ gas is also decomposed at ordinary temperatures\r\nwith flame, and, if there is not a large excess of hydrochloric acid\r\npresent, with detonation. Hydrofluoric acid and free chlorine are the\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nGaseous _hydrobromic_ and _hydriodic acids_ react with fluorine in a\r\nsimilar manner, with production of flame and formation of hydrofluoric\r\nacid. Inasmuch, however, as bromine and iodine combine with fluorine,\r\nas previously described, these halogens do not escape, but burn up to\r\ntheir respective fluorides. When fluorine is delivered into an aqueous\r\nsolution of hydriodic acid, each bubble as it enters produces a flash\r\nof flame, and if the fluorine is being evolved fairly rapidly there is\r\na series of very violent detonations. A curious reaction also occurs\r\nwhen fluorine is similarly passed into a 50 per cent. aqueous solution\r\nof hydrofluoric acid itself, a flame being produced in the middle of\r\nthe liquid, accompanied by a series of detonations.\r\n\r\n_Nitric acid_ vapor reacts with great violence with fluorine, a loud\r\nexplosion resulting. If fluorine is passed into the ordinary liquid\r\nacid, each bubble as it enters produces a flame in the liquid.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia gas_ is decomposed by fluorine with formation of a yellow\r\nflame, forming hydrofluoric acid and liberating nitrogen. With a\r\nsolution of the gas in water, each bubble of fluorine produces an\r\nexplosion and flame, as in case of hydriodic acid.\r\n\r\n_Phosphoric anhydride_, when heated to low redness, burns with a pale\r\nflame in fluorine, forming a gaseous mixture of fluorides and\r\noxyfluoride of phosphorus. _Pentachloride and trichloride of\r\nphosphorus_ both react most energetically with fluorine, instantly\r\nproducing a brilliant flame, and evolving a mixture of phosphorus\r\npentafluoride and free chlorine.\r\n\r\n_Arsenious anhydride_ also affords a brilliant combustion, forming the\r\nliquid trifluoride of arsenic, AsF_{3}. This liquid in turn appears to\r\nreact with more fluorine with considerable evolution of heat, probably\r\nforming the pentafluoride, AsF_{5}. _Chloride of arsenic_, AsCl_{3},\r\nis converted with considerable energy to the trifluoride, free\r\nchlorine being liberated.\r\n\r\n_Carbon bisulphide_ inflames in the cold in contact with fluorine, and\r\nif the fluorine is led into the midst of the liquid a similar\r\nproduction of flame occurs under the surface of the liquid, as in case\r\nof nitric acid. No carbon is deposited, both the carbon and sulphur\r\nbeing entirely converted into gaseous fluorides.\r\n\r\n_Carbon tetrachloride_, as previously mentioned, reacts only very\r\nslowly with fluorine. The liquid may be saturated with gaseous\r\nfluorine at 15°, but on boiling this liquid a gaseous mixture is\r\nevolved, one constituent of which is carbon tetrafluoride, CF_{4}, a\r\ngas readily capable of absorption by alcoholic potash. The remainder\r\nconsists of another fluoride of carbon, incapable of absorption by\r\npotash and chlorine. A mixture of the vapors of carbon tetrachloride\r\nand fluorine inflames spontaneously with detonation, and chlorine is\r\nliberated without deposition of carbon.\r\n\r\n_Boric anhydride_ is raised to a most vivid incandescence by fluorine,\r\nthe experiment being rendered very beautiful by the abundant white\r\nfumes of the trifluoride which are liberated.\r\n\r\n_Silicon dioxide_, one of the most inert of substances at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, takes fire in the cold in contact with fluorine, becoming\r\ninstantly white-hot, and rapidly disappearing in the form of silicon\r\ntetrafluoride. The _chlorides_ of both _boron_ and _silicon_ are\r\ndecomposed by fluorine, with formation of fluorides and liberation of\r\nchlorine, the reaction being accompanied by the production of flame.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF FLUORINE UPON METALLIC COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\n_Chlorides_ of the metals are instantly decomposed by fluorine,\r\ngenerally at the ordinary temperature, and in certain cases, antimony\r\ntrichloride for instance, with the appearance of flame. Chlorine is in\r\neach case liberated, and a fluoride of the metal formed. A few require\r\nheating, when a similar decomposition occurs, often accompanied by\r\nincandescence, as in case of chromium sesquichloride.\r\n\r\n_Bromides_ and _iodides_ are decomposed with even greater energy, and\r\nthe liberated bromine and iodine burn in the fluorine with formation\r\nof their respective fluorides.\r\n\r\n_Cyanides_ react in a most beautiful manner with fluorine, the\r\ndisplaced cyanogen burning with a purple flame. Potassium ferrocyanide\r\nin particular affords a very pretty experiment, and reacts in the\r\ncold. Ordinary potassium cyanide requires slightly warming in order to\r\nstart the combustion.\r\n\r\nFused _potash_ yields potassium fluoride and ozone. Aqueous potash\r\ndoes not form potassium hypofluorite when fluorine is bubbled into it,\r\nbut only potassium fluoride. _Lime_ becomes most brilliantly\r\nincandescent, owing partly to the excess being raised to a very high\r\ntemperature by the heat developed during the decomposition, and partly\r\nto the phosphorescence of the calcium fluoride formed.\r\n\r\n_Sulphides_ of the alkalies and alkaline earths are also immediately\r\nrendered incandescent, fluorides of the metal and sulphur being\r\nrespectively formed.\r\n\r\n_Boron nitride_ behaves in an exceedingly beautiful manner, being\r\nattacked in the cold, and emitting a brilliant blue light which is\r\nsurrounded by a halo of the fumes of boron fluoride.\r\n\r\n_Sulphates_, _nitrates_ and _phosphates_ generally require the\r\napplication of more or less heat, when they too are rapidly and\r\nenergetically decomposed. Calcium phosphate is attacked in the cold\r\nlike lime, giving out a brilliant white light, and producing calcium\r\nfluoride and gaseous oxyfluoride of phosphorus, POF_{3}. _Calcium\r\ncarbonate_ also becomes raised to brilliant incandescence when exposed\r\nto fluorine gas, as does also normal _sodium carbonate_; but curiously\r\nenough the bicarbonates of the alkalies do not react with fluorine\r\neven at red heat. Perhaps this may be explained by the fact that\r\nfluorine has no action at available temperatures upon carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF FLUORINE UPON A FEW ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\n_Chloroform._--When chloroform is saturated with fluorine, and\r\nsubsequently boiled, carbon tetrafluoride, hydrofluoric acid and\r\nchlorine are evolved. If a drop of chloroform is agitated in a glass\r\ntube with excess of fluorine, a violent explosion suddenly occurs,\r\naccompanied by a flash of flame, and the tube is shattered to pieces.\r\nThe reaction is very lively when fluorine is evolved in the midst of a\r\nquantity of chloroform, a persistent flame burns beneath the surface\r\nof the liquid, carbon is deposited, and fluorides of hydrogen and\r\ncarbon are evolved together with chlorine.\r\n\r\n_Methyl chloride_ is decomposed by fluorine, even at -23°, with\r\nproduction of a yellow flame, deposition of carbon, and liberation of\r\nfluorides of hydrogen and carbon and free chlorine. With the vapor of\r\nmethyl chloride, as pointed out in the description of the\r\nelectrolysis, violent explosions occur.\r\n\r\n_Ethyl alcohol_ vapor at once takes fire in fluorine gas, and the\r\nliquid is decomposed with explosive violence without deposition of\r\ncarbon. Aldehyde is formed to a considerable extent during the\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n_Acetic acid_ and _benzene_ are both decomposed with violence, their\r\ncold vapors burn in fluorine, and when the latter is bubbled through\r\nthe liquids themselves, flashes of flame, and often most dangerous\r\nexplosions, occur. In the case of benzene, carbon is deposited, and\r\nwith both liquids fluorides of hydrogen and carbon are evolved.\r\n_Aniline_ likewise takes fire in fluorine, and deposits a large\r\nquantity of carbon, which, however, if the fluorine is in excess,\r\nburns away completely to carbon tetrafluoride.\r\n\r\nSuch are the main outlines of these later researches of M. Moissan,\r\nand they cannot fail to impress those who read them with the\r\nprodigious nature of the forces associated with those minutest of\r\nentities, the chemical atoms, as exhibited at their maximum, in so far\r\nas our knowledge at present goes, in the case of the element\r\nfluorine.--_Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF FAT IN MILK.\r\n\r\nBy E. MOLISABI.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe author, after criticising the various methods for estimating fat\r\nin milk which have been proposed from time to time, agrees with Stokes\r\n(_Analyst_, 1885, p. 48), Eustace Hill (_Analyst_, 1891, p. 67), and\r\nBondzynsky (_Landwirth Jahrb. der Schweiz_, 1889), that the method of\r\nWerner Schmid is the simplest, most rapid, and convenient hitherto\r\nintroduced. The conditions tending to inaccuracy are: The employment\r\nof ether containing alcohol; boiling the mixture of milk and acid too\r\nlong, when a caramel-like body is formed, soluble in ether; the\r\ndifficulty of reading off the volume of ether left in the tube, owing\r\nto the gradations of the instrument being obscured by the flocculent\r\nlayer of casein; when only a portion of the ether is used, fat may be\r\nleft behind in the acid mixture, as shown by Allen (_Chem. Zeit._,\r\n1891, p. 331). The author believes that by the invention of the simple\r\napparatus represented in the accompanying figure, he has rendered the\r\nprocess both accurate and convenient. This consists of a flask B of\r\nabout 75 c.c. capacity, which has a glass tap fused on, with two\r\ncapillary tubes attached, the one passing upward, the other downward.\r\nThe neck of flask B is ground into the neck of flask A, which holds\r\nabout 90 c.c. Either of the flasks can be placed in communication with\r\nthe external air by the opening _a_. The ether must be previously\r\nwashed with one or two tenths of its volume of water, to remove traces\r\nof alcohol. The operation is performed as follows: 10 c.c. of well\r\nmixed milk are weighed in (or measured into) flask A, 10 c.c. of\r\nhydrochloric acid added, and the mixture heated to boiling on an\r\nasbestos sheet. The boiling must not exceed a minute and a half, the\r\nfluid being shaken from time to time, and not allowed to become of a\r\ndeeper color than a dark brown [not black]. The flask is cooled, and\r\n25 c.c. of ether added. The two flasks are connected as shown in the\r\nfigure, the tap closed, and the whole shaken for a few minutes, the\r\nflask being vented two or three times by the opening _a_. The\r\napparatus is now inverted, allowed to stand five or six minutes, the\r\ntap turned, and the dark acid liquid drawn off into flask B. By a\r\nlittle shaking of the ether the whole of the acid liquid may be easily\r\ngot into the lower flask. The apparatus is again inverted, then\r\nseparated, 10 c.c. of ether are introduced into the flask B, the tap\r\nclosed, and the fluids well shaken. When the ether layer is distinct,\r\nthe acid liquor is run off, and the ether solution transferred to A.\r\nThe whole of the ether solution is washed in the apparatus two or\r\nthree times with a little water, the flask A removed to the water\r\nbath, the ether driven off, the last traces of ether and water being\r\nremoved by placing the flask in a drying oven heated from 107 to 110°\r\nC., where it must remain at least twenty minutes. The usual cooling in\r\nthe exsiccator and weighing concludes the operation. Examples are\r\ngiven showing its concordance with the Adams and other recognized\r\nprocesses. Sour milk, which must be weighed in the flask, can be\r\nconveniently analyzed; also cream, using 5 grammes cream and 10 c.c.\r\nhydrochloric acid. (_Berichte Deutsch. Chem.

A Bibliography of Geometrical Isomerism. Accompanying an address on\r\nthis subject to the Chemical Section of the American Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Science at Indianapolis, August, 1890, by Professor\r\nRobert B. Warder, Vice President. Proceedings A.A.A.S., vol. xxxix.\r\nSalem, 1890. 8vo.\r\n\r\n2. A Bibliography of the Chemical Influence of Light, by Alfred\r\nTuckerman. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections No. 785. Washington,\r\nD.C., 1891. Pp. 22. 8vo.\r\n\r\n3. A Bibliography of Analytical Chemistry for the year 1890, by H.\r\nCarrington Bolton. J. Anal. Appl. Chem., v., No. 3. March, 1891.\r\n\r\nWe chronicle the publication of the following important bibliography:\r\n\r\n4. A Guide to the Literature of Sugar. A book of reference for\r\nchemists, botanists, librarians, manufacturers and planters, with\r\ncomprehensive subject index. By H. Ling Roth. London: Kegan Paul,\r\nTrench, Trubner & Co. Limited. 1890. 8vo. Pp xvi-159.\r\n\r\nThis work contains more than 1,200 titles of books, pamphlets, and\r\npapers relating to sugar. Many of the titles are supplemented with\r\nbrief abstracts. The alphabetical author catalogue is followed by a\r\nchronological table and an analytical subject index. The compilation\r\nextends to the beginning of the year 1885, and the author promises a\r\nsupplement and possibly an annual guide.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious work is useful but very incomplete. It does not include\r\nglucose. The author gives a list of fifteen periodicals devoted to\r\nsugar, and omits exactly fifteen more recorded in Bolton's _Catalogue\r\nof Scientific and Technical Periodicals_ (1665-1882). Angelo Sala's\r\n_Saccharologia_ is not named, though mentioned in Roscoe and\r\nSchorlemmer and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding some blemishes, this work is indispensable to chemists\r\ndesirous of becoming familiar with the literature of sugar. It is to\r\nbe hoped that a second edition brought down to date may be issued by\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\n5. A Bibliography of Ptomaines accompanies Professor Victor C.\r\nVaughan's work, Ptomaines and Leucomaines. Philadelphia, 1888. (Pages\r\n296-814.) 8vo.\r\n\r\nChemists will hail with pleasure the announcement that a new\r\ndictionary of solubilities is in progress by a competent hand.\r\nProfessor Arthur M. Comey, of Tufts College, College Hill, Mass.,\r\nwrites that the work he has undertaken will be as complete as\r\npossible. \"The very old matter which forms so large a part of Storer's\r\nDictionary will be referred to, and in important cases fully given.\r\nAbbreviations will be freely used and formulæ will be given instead of\r\nthe chemical names of substances, in the body of the book. This is\r\nfound to be absolutely necessary in order to bring the work into a\r\nconvenient size for use ..., The arrangement will be strictly\r\nalphabetical. References to original papers will be given in all cases\r\n...\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Comey estimates his work will contain over\r\n70,000 entries, and will make a volume of 1,500-1,700 pages.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Mr. Howard L. Prince, Librarian of the\r\nUnited States Patent Office, explains itself:\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON, D.C., February 11, 1891\r\n\r\n    _Dr. H Carrington Bolton._\r\n      _University Club, New York, N.Y._:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR--In response to your request I take pleasure in\r\n    giving you the following information regarding the past\r\n    accomplishments and plans for the future of the Scientific\r\n    Library in the matter of technological indexing.\r\n\r\n    The work of indexing periodicals has been carried on in the\r\n    library for some years in a somewhat desultory fashion, taking\r\n    up one journal after another, the object being, apparently, more\r\n    to supply clerks with work than the pursuance of any well\r\n    defined plan. However, one important work has been substantially\r\n    completed, viz., a general index to the whole set of the\r\n    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and SUPPLEMENT from 1846 to date.\r\n\r\n    It is unnecessary for me to point out to you the importance of\r\n    this work, embracing a collection which has held the leading\r\n    place in the line of general information on invention and\r\n    progress, the labor of compiling which has been so formidable\r\n    that no movement in that direction has been attempted by the\r\n    publishers except in regard to the SUPPLEMENT only, and that\r\n    very imperfectly. This index embraces now 184,600 cards, not\r\n    punched, and at present stored in shallow drawers and fastened\r\n    by rubber bands, and of course they are at present unavailable\r\n    for use. There is little prospect of printing this index, and\r\n    I have been endeavoring for some time to throw the index open\r\n    to the public by punching the cards and fastening them with\r\n    guard rods, but as yet have made no perceptible impression\r\n    upon the authorities, although the expense of preparation\r\n    would be only about $70.\r\n\r\n    There has also been completed an index to the English journal\r\n    _Engineering_, comprising 84,000 cards, from the beginning to\r\n    date.\r\n\r\n    An index to Dingler's _Polytechnisches Journal_ was also\r\n    commenced as long ago as 1878, carried on for six or seven\r\n    years and then dropped. I hope, however, at no remote date, to\r\n    bring this forward to the present time.\r\n\r\n    On taking charge of the library I was at once impressed with\r\n    the immense value of the periodical literature on our shelves\r\n    and the great importance of making it more readily accessible,\r\n    and have had in contemplation for some time the beginning of a\r\n    card index to all our periodicals on the same general plan as\r\n    that of Rieth's Repertorium. I have, however, been unable to\r\n    obtain sufficient force to cover the whole ground, but have\r\n    selected about one hundred and fifty journals, notably those\r\n    upon the subjects of chemistry, electricity and engineering,\r\n    both in English and foreign languages, the indexing of which\r\n    has been in progress since the first of January. This number\r\n    includes substantially all the valuable material in our\r\n    possession in the English language, not only journals, but\r\n    transactions of societies, all the electrical journals and\r\n    nearly all the chemical in foreign languages. This index will\r\n    be kept open to the public as soon as sufficient material has\r\n    accumulated. In general plan it will be alphabetical,\r\n    following nearly the arrangement of the periodical portion of\r\n    the surgeon general's catalogue. I shall depart from the\r\n    strictly alphabetical plan sufficiently to group under such\r\n    important subjects as chemistry, electricity, engineering,\r\n    railroads, etc., all the subdivisions of the art, so that the\r\n    electrical investigator, for instance, will not be obliged to\r\n    travel from one end of the alphabet to the other to find the\r\n    divisions of generators, conductors, dynamos, telephones,\r\n    telegraphs, etc., and in the grouping of the classes of\r\n    applied science the office classification of inventions will,\r\n    as a rule, be adhered to, the subdivisions being, of course,\r\n    arranged in alphabetical order under their general head and\r\n    the title of the several articles also arranged alphabetically\r\n    by authors or principal words.\r\n\r\n    With many thanks for the kind interest and valuable\r\n    information afforded me, I remain, very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                            HOWARD L. PRINCE,\r\n                            Librarian Scientific Library.\r\n\r\nThe committee much prefers to record completed work than to mention\r\nprojects, as the latter sometimes fail. It is satisfactory, however,\r\nto announce that the indefatigable indexer, Dr. Alfred Tuckerman, is\r\nengaged on an extensive Bibliography of Mineral Waters. The chairman\r\nof the committee expects to complete the MS. of a Select Bibliography\r\nof Chemistry during the year, visiting the chief libraries of Europe\r\nfor the purpose this summer.\r\n\r\n          H.

Officiel_, July 11, 1891) includes the\r\nfollowing provisions:\r\n\r\nSect. 1. The product of fermentation of the husks of grapes from which\r\nthe must has been extracted with water, with or without the addition\r\nof sugar, or mixed with wine in whatever proportion, may only be sold,\r\nor offered for sale, under the name of husk wine or sugared wine.\r\n\r\nSect. 2. The addition of the following substances to wine, husk wine,\r\nsugared wine, or raisin wine will be considered an adulteration:\r\n\r\n1. Coloring matters of all descriptions.\r\n\r\n2. Sulphuric, nitric, hydrochloric, salicylic, boric acid, or similar\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n3. Sodium chloride beyond one gramme per liter.\r\n\r\nSect. 3. The sale of plastered wines, containing more than two grammes\r\nof potassium, or sodium sulphate, is prohibited.\r\n\r\nOffenders are subject to a fine of 16 to 500 francs, or to\r\nimprisonment from six days to three months, according to\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nBarrels or vessels containing plastered wine must have affixed a\r\nnotice to that effect in large letters, and the books, invoices, and\r\nbills of lading must likewise bear such notice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALLOTROPIC CONDITIONS OF SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Berthelot recently called the attention of the Academy (Paris) to\r\nthe memoirs of Carey Lea on the allotropic states of silver, and\r\nexhibited specimens of the color of gold and others of a purple color\r\nsent him by the author. He explained the importance of these results,\r\nwhich remind us of the work of the ancient alchemists, but he reserved\r\nthe question whether these substances are really isomeric states of\r\nsilver or complex and condensed compounds, sharing the properties of\r\nthe element which constituted the principal mass (97-98 per cent.),\r\nconformably to the facts known in the history of the various carbons,\r\nof the derivatives of red phosphorus, and especially of the varieties\r\nof iron and steel. Between these condensed compounds and the pure\r\nelements the continuous transition of the physical and chemical\r\nproperties is often effected by insensible degrees, by a mixture of\r\ndefinite compounds.\r\n\r\nThe following letter appears in a recent number of the _Chemical\r\nNews_.\r\n\r\n_Sir_: In a recently published lecture, Mr. Meldola seems to call in\r\nquestion the existence of allotropic silver. This opinion does not\r\nappear, however, to be based on any adequate study of the subject, but\r\nto be somewhat conjectural in its nature. No experimental support of\r\nany sort is given, and the only argument offered (if such it can be\r\ncalled) is that this altered form of silver is analogous to that of\r\nmetals whose properties have been greatly changed by being _alloyed_\r\nwith small quantities of other metals. Does, then, Mr. Meldola suppose\r\nthat a silver alloy can be formed by precipitating silver in the\r\npresence of another metal from an aqueous solution, or that one can\r\nargue from alloys, which are solutions, to molecular compounds or\r\nlakes? Moreover, he has overlooked the fact that allotropic silver can\r\nbe obtained in the absence of any metal with which silver is capable\r\nof combining, as in the case of its formation by the action of soda\r\nand dextrine. Silver cannot be alloyed with sodium.\r\n\r\nMr. Meldola cites Prange as having shown that allotropic silver\r\nobtained with the aid of ferrous citrate contains traces of iron, a\r\nfact which was published by me several years earlier, with an\r\nanalytical determination of the amount of iron found. Mr. Prange\r\nrepeated and confirmed this fact of the presence of iron (in this\r\nparticular case), and my other observations generally, and was fully\r\nconvinced of the existence of both soluble and insoluble allotropic\r\nsilver. Mr. Meldola's quotation of Mr. Prange would not convey this\r\nimpression to the reader.\r\n\r\nOf the many forms of allotropic silver, two of the best marked are the\r\nblue and the yellow.\r\n\r\nBlue allotropic silver is formed in many reactions with the aid of\r\nmany wholly different reagents. To suppose that each of these many\r\nsubstances is capable of uniting in minute quantity with silver to\r\nproduce in all cases an identical result, the same product with\r\nidentical color and properties, would be an absurdity.\r\n\r\nGold-colored allotropic silver in thin films is converted by the\r\nslightest pressure to normal silver. A glass rod drawn over it with a\r\ngentle pressure leaves a gray line behind it of ordinary silver. If\r\nthe film is then plunged into solution of potassium ferricyanide it\r\nbecomes red or blue, while the lines traced show by their different\r\nreaction that they consist of ordinary silver. Heat, electricity, and\r\ncontact with strong acids produce a similar change to ordinary gray\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThese reactions afford the clearest proof that the silver is in an\r\nallotropic form. To account for them on suppositions like Mr.\r\nMeldola's would involve an exceedingly forced interpretation, such as\r\nno one who carefully repeated my work could possibly entertain.\r\n\r\nI am, etc.,\r\n\r\n  M.
