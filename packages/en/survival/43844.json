La ville de Bordeaux!_\"\r\n\r\nThe conductor's voice roused me from the dreamy state of dose in which I\r\nlay, luxuriously stretched back amid cloaks and old English\r\nrailway-wrappers, in the roomy banquette of one of the biggest\r\ndiligences which ever rumbled out of Caillard and Lafitte's yard.\r\n\r\n\"_Voila! la Voila!_\" The bloused peasant who drove the six stout nags\r\ntherewith stirred in his place; his long whip whistled and cracked; the\r\nhorses flung up their heads as they broke into a canter, and their bells\r\nrang like a joy peal; while Niniche, the conductor's white poodle,\r\nwhich maintained a perilous footing in the leathern hood of the\r\nbanquette, pattered and scratched above our heads, and barked in\r\nrecognition of his master's voice.\r\n\r\nI rubbed my eyes and looked. We were on the ridge of a wooded hill.\r\nBelow us lay a flat green plain, carpetted with vines. Right across it\r\nran the broad, white, chalky highway, powdering with dust the double\r\navenue of chestnuts which lined it. Beyond the plain glittered a great\r\nriver, crowded with shipping, and beyond the river rose stretching,\r\napparently for miles, a magnificent façade of high white buildings,\r\nbroken here and there by the foliage of public gardens, and the dark\r\nembouchures of streets; while, behind the range of quays, and golden in\r\nthe sunrise, rose high into the clear morning air, a goodly array of\r\ntowering Gothic steeples, fretted and pinnacled up to the glancing\r\nweather-cocks. It was, indeed, Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nThe long journey from Paris was all but over, yet though I had been\r\ntired enough of the way, I felt as if I could brave it again, rather\r\nthan make the exertion of encountering octroi officers, and plunging\r\ninto strange hotels. For after all, comfortable Diligence travelling\r\nmakes a man lazy. It is slow, but you get accustomed to the slowness; in\r\nthe banquette, too, you are never cramped; there is luxurious roominess\r\nbehind, and you plunge your legs in straw up to the knees. Then leaning\r\nsupinely back, you indulge a serene passiveness, rolling lazily on with\r\nthe rumbling mountain of a vehicle. The thunder of the heavy wheels, and\r\nthe low monotonous clash, clash, clash, of the hundred grelots, form a\r\nsoothing atmosphere of sound about you, and musingly, and dreamingly you\r\nwatch the action of the team--these half dozen little but stout tough\r\nwork-a-day horses, trotting manfully in their rough harness, while the\r\ndriver--oh, how different from our old coaching dandies!--a clumsy\r\npeasant, in sabots, and a stable-smelling blouse, sits slouched, and\r\nround-shouldered like a sack before you, incessantly flourishing that\r\nwhistling whip, and shouting in the uncouth jargon of his province, to\r\nthe jingling team below. And next you watch the country or the road. A\r\nFrench road, like a mathematical line, on, and on, and on, straight,\r\nstraight, mournfully, dismally, straight, running like a tape laid\r\nacross the bleak bare country, till it fades, and fades, and seems to\r\ntip over the horizon; or if you are in an undulating wooded district,\r\nyou catch sections of it as it climbs each successive ridge; and you\r\nknow that in the valleys it is just the same as on the hill tops. You\r\nsee your dinner before you, as Englishmen say over roast mutton. You see\r\nyour journey before you, as Frenchmen may say, over the slow trotting\r\nteam. And how drear and deserted the country looks--open, desolate, and\r\nbare. Here and there a distant mite of a peasant or two bending over the\r\nsun-burnt clods. No cottages, but ever and anon a congregation of\r\nbarns--the _bourgs_ in which the small land-owners collect; now a witch\r\nof an old woman herding a cow; anon a solitary shepherd all in rags,\r\nknitting coarse stockings, and followed by a handful of sheep, long in\r\nthe legs, low in the flesh, with thin dirty fleeces as ragged as their\r\nguardian's coat. Upon the road travellers are scanty. The bronzed\r\nCantonier stares as you pass, his brass-lettered hat glittering in the\r\nglare. There go a couple of soldiers on furlough, tramping the dreary\r\nway to their native village, footsore, weary and slow, their hairy\r\nknapsacks galling their shoulders, and their tin canteens evidently\r\nempty. Another diligence, white with dust, meeting us. The conductors\r\nshout to each other, and the passengers crane their heads out of window.\r\nThen we overtake a whole caravan of _roulage_, or carriers, the\r\nwell-loaded carts poised upon one pair of huge wheels, the horses, with\r\ntheir clumsy harness and high peaked collars, making a scant two miles\r\nan hour. Not an equipage of any pretension to be seen. No graceful\r\nphaeton, no slangy dog-cart, no cosey family carriage--only now and then\r\na crawling local diligence, or M. le Curé on a shocking bad horse, or an\r\nindescribably dilapidated anomalous jingling appearance of a vague\r\nshandry-dan. And so on from dawn till sunset, through narrow streeted\r\ntowns, with lanterns swinging above our heads, and open squares with\r\nscrubby lime trees, and white-washed cafés all around; and by a shabby\r\nmunicipality with gilded heads to the front railings, a dilapidated\r\ntricolor, and a short-legged, red-legged sentinel, not so tall as his\r\nfirelock, keeping watch over it; and then, out into the open, fenceless,\r\nhedgeless country, and on upon the straight unflinching road, and\r\nthrough the long, long tunnels of eternal poplar trees, and by the\r\ncantonnier, and the melancholy _bourgs_, and the wandering soldiers, and\r\nthe dusty carriers' carts as before.\r\n\r\nOne thing strikes you forcibly in these little country towns--the\r\nmarvellously small degree of distinction of rank amid the people. No\r\nneighbouring magnate rattles through the lonely streets in the\r\nwell-known carriage of the Hall or the Grange, graciously receiving the\r\nready homage of the townspeople. No retired man of business, or bustling\r\nland-agent, trots his smart gig and cob--no half-pay officer goes\r\ngossipping from house to house, or from shop to shop. There is no\r\nbanker's lady to lead the local fashions--no doctor, setting off upon\r\nhis well-worked nag for long country rounds--no assemblage, if it be\r\nmarket day, of stout full-fed farmers, lounging, booted and spurred,\r\nround the Red Lion or the Plough. Working men in blouses, women of the\r\nsame rank in the peasant head-dress of the country, and here and there a\r\nnondescript personage in a cap and shooting jacket, who generally turns\r\nup at the scantily-attended table d'hôte at dinner time--such are the\r\nitems which make up the mass of the visible population. You hardly see\r\nan individual who does not appear to have been born and bred upon the\r\nspot, and to have no ideas and no desires beyond it. Left entirely to\r\nthemselves, the people have vegetated in these dull streets from\r\ngeneration to generation, and, though clustered together in a quasi\r\ntown--perhaps with octroi and mairie, a withered tree of liberty, and\r\nbilliard tables by the half-dozen--the population is as essentially\r\nrural as though scattered in lone farms, unvisited, except on rent-day,\r\nby either landlord or agent. It often happens that a large landed\r\nproprietor has not even a house upon his ground. He lets the land,\r\nreceives his rent, and spends it in Paris or one of the large towns,\r\nleaving his tenants to go on cultivating the ground in the jog-trot\r\nstyle of their fathers and their grandfathers before them. The French,\r\nin fact, have no notion of what we understand by the life of a country\r\ngentleman. A proprietor may pay a sporting visit to his land when\r\npartridge and quail are to be shot; but as to taking up his abode _au\r\nfond de ses terres_, mingling in what we would call county business,\r\nlooking after the proceedings of his tenants, becoming learned, in an\r\namateur way, in things bucolic, in all the varieties of stock and all\r\nthe qualities of scientific manures--a life, a character, and a social\r\nposition of this sort, would be in vain sought for in the rural\r\ndistricts of France. There are not, in fact, two more differing meanings\r\nin the world than those attached to our \"Country Life,\" and the French\r\n_Vie de Chateau_. The French proprietor is a Parisian out of Paris. He\r\ntakes the rents, shoots the quails, and the clowns do the rest.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman ought to feel at home in the south-west of France. That\r\nfair town, rising beyond the yellow Garonne, was for three hundred years\r\nand more an English capital. Who built these gloriously fretted Gothic\r\ntowers, rising high into the air, and sentinelled by so many minor\r\nsteeples? Why Englishmen! These towers rise above the Cathedral of St.\r\nAndrew, and in the Abbey of St. Andrew the Black Prince held high court,\r\nand there, after Poitiers, the captive King of France revelled with his\r\nconqueror, with the best face he might. There our Richard the Second was\r\nborn. There the doughty Earl of Derby, long the English seneschal of\r\nBordeaux, with his retinue, \"amused themselves,\" as gloriously\r\ngossipping old Froissart tells, \"with the citizens and their wives;\" and\r\nfrom thence Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, went forth, being eighty-six\r\nyears of age, mounted upon a little palfrey, to encounter the Duke of\r\nAnjou, in those latter days when our continental dominions were\r\nshrinking, as we deserved that they should shrink, after the brutal\r\nmurder of the glorious Maid of Domrémy. It is true that we are at this\r\nmoment in the department of the Dordogne, and that when we cross the\r\nriver we shall be in that of the Gironde. But we Englishmen love the\r\nancient provinces better than the modern departments, which we are\r\ngenerally as bad at recognising, as we are in finding out dates by\r\nThermidors and Brumaires. No, no, departments may do for Frenchmen, but\r\nto an Englishman the rich land we are crossing will ever be Guienne, the\r\n\"Fair Dutchy,\" and part and parcel of old Aquitane, the dowry of\r\nEleanor, when she wedded our second Henry.\r\n\r\nIs it not strange to think of those old times, in which the English were\r\nloved in the Bourdelois--fine old name--and the French were hated, in\r\nwhich the Gascon feudal chiefs around protested that they were the\r\n\"natural born subjects of England, which was so kind to them?\" Let us\r\nturn to Froissart:--The Duke of Anjou having captured four Gascon\r\nknights, forced them, _nolens volens_, to take the oath of allegiance to\r\nthe King of France, and then turned them about their business. The\r\nknights went straight to Bordeaux, and presented themselves before the\r\nseneschal of the Landes, and the mayor of the city, saying, \"Gentlemen,\r\nwe will truly tell you that before we took the oath, we reserved in our\r\nhearts our faith to our natural lord, the king of England, and for\r\nanything we have said or done, we never will become Frenchmen.\" Our\r\ngallant forefathers appear on the whole, to have led a joyous life in\r\nGuienne. In truth, their days and nights were devoted very much to\r\nfeasting themselves, and plundering their neighbours: two pursuits into\r\nwhich their Gascon friends entered with heart and soul. It is quite\r\ndelightful to read in Froissart, or Enguerrand de Monstrelet, how\r\n\"twelve knights went forth in search of adventures,\" an announcement\r\nwhich may be fairly translated, into how a dozen of gentlemen with\r\nindistinct notions of _meum_ and _tuum_, went forth to lay their\r\nchivalrous hands upon anything they could come across. Of course these\r\ntrips were made into the French territory, and really they appear to\r\nhave been conducted with no small degree of politeness on either side,\r\nwhen the English \"harried\" Limousin, or the French rode a foray into\r\nGuienne. The chivalrous feeling was strong on both sides, and we often\r\nread how such-and-such a French and English knight or squire did\r\ncourteous battle with each other; the fight being held in honour of the\r\nfair ladies of the respective champions. Thus, not in Guienne, but in\r\nTouraine, when the English and the Gascons beleaguered a French town,\r\nheralds came forth upon the walls and made this proclamation:--\"Is there\r\nany among you gentlemen, who for love of his lady is willing to try some\r\nfeat of arms? If there be any such, here is Gauvin Micaille, a squire\r\nof the Beauce, quite ready to sally forth, completely armed and\r\nmounted, to tilt three courses with the lance, give three blows with the\r\nbattle-axe, and three strokes with the dagger. Now look you, English, if\r\nthere be none among you in love.\" The challenge was duly accepted. Each\r\ncombatant wounded the other, and the Earl of Shrewsbury sent to the\r\nsquire of Beauce his compliments, and a hundred francs. This last\r\npresent takes somewhat away from the Amadis de Gaul, and Palmerin of\r\nEngland vein; but the student of the old chroniclers, particularly of\r\nthe English in France, will be astonished to find how long the chivalric\r\nfeeling and ceremonials co-existed with constant habits of plundering\r\nand unprovoked forays.\r\n\r\nAnother curious trait of our forefathers in Guienne is the early\r\ndevelopment of the English _brusquerie_, and haughtiness of manner to\r\nthe Continentals. The Gascons put up, however, with many a slight,\r\ninasmuch as their over sea friends were such valiant plunderers, and\r\nthey, of course, shared the spoils. Listen to the frank declaration of a\r\nGascon gentleman who had deserted from the English to the French side.\r\nSome one asking him how he did, he answers: \"Thank God, my health is\r\nvery good; but I had more money at command when I made war for the king\r\nof England, for then we seldom failed to meet some rich merchants of\r\nToulouse, Condom, La Reole, or Bergerac, whom we squeezed, which made us\r\ngay and _debonnair_; but that is at an end.\" The questioner replies: \"Of\r\na truth, that is the life Gascons love. They willingly hurt their\r\nneighbour.\" Not even all the plunder they got, however, could silence\r\nthe grumblings of the native knights at the haughty reserve of the\r\nEnglish warriors. \"I,\" says the canon of Chimay, \"was at Bordeaux when\r\nthe Prince of Wales marched to Spain, and witnessed the great\r\nhaughtiness of the English, who are affable to no other nation than\r\ntheir own. Neither could any of the gentlemen of Gascogny or Acquitaine\r\nobtain office or appointment in their own country, for the English said\r\nthey were neither on a level with them, nor worthy of their society.\" So\r\nearly and so strongly did the proud island blood boil up; while many an\r\nEnglishman, to this good day, by his reserved and saturnine bearing\r\namong an outspoken and merry-hearted people, perpetuates the old\r\nreproach, and keeps up the old grievance.\r\n\r\nAll sensible readers will be gratified when I state that I have not the\r\nremotest intention of describing the archæology of Bordeaux, or any\r\nother town whatever. Whoever wants to know the height of a steeple, the\r\nlength of an aisle, or the number of arches in a bridge, must betake\r\nthemselves to Murray and his compeers. I will neither be picturesquely\r\nprofound upon ogives, triforia, clerestorys, screens, or mouldings; nor\r\nmagniloquently great upon the arched, the early pointed, the florid, or\r\nthe flamboyant schools. I will go into raptures neither about Virgins\r\nnor Holy Families, nor Oriel windows, in the fine old cut-and-dry school\r\nof the traveller of taste, which means, of course, every traveller who\r\never packed a shirt into a carpet bag; but, leaving the mere archæology\r\nand carved stones alone in their glory, I will try to sketch living,\r\nand now and then historical, France--to move gossippingly along in the\r\nby-ways rather than the highways--always more prone to give a good\r\nlegend of a grey old castle, than a correct measurement of the height of\r\nthe towers; and always seeking to bring up, as well as I can, a varying,\r\nshifting picture, well thronged with humanity, before the reader's eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORDEAUX.]\r\n\r\nWhen I got to Bordeaux, the vintage time had just commenced, and having\r\never had a special notion that vintages were very beautiful and poetic\r\naffairs, and a still more confirmed taste and reverence for claret, it\r\nwas my object to see as much of the vintage as I could--to see the juice\r\nrush from the grape, which makes so good a figure in the bottle. Letters\r\nof introduction I had none. But there is a knack of making one's own\r\nway--of making one's own friends as you go--in which I have tolerable\r\nconfidence, and which did not fail me in the present conjuncture. First,\r\nto settle and make up my notions, I strolled vaguely about the city,\r\nbuying local maps and little local guide-books. Bordeaux is emphatically\r\nwhat the French call a _riant_ town, with plenty of air, and such pure,\r\nsoft, bright, sunny air. In the centre of a broad grand _Place_,--dotted\r\nwith very respectable trees for French specimens, emblazoned with gay\r\nparterres, sprinkled with orange shrubs in bloom, and holed with no end\r\nof round stone basins, in which dolphins and Neptunes spout from their\r\nbronze mouths the live-long day, and urns, and pillars, and Dianas, and\r\nApollos stand all around--there rises upon his massive pedestal the\r\ngraven image of a fat comfortable gentleman in the ample cloak and\r\ndoublet of Louis Quatorze, knots of carven ribbons decorating his\r\nshoulders, and flowing locks descending from under his broad-brimmed,\r\nlooped-up hat. This is the statue of a M. de Tournay, an ancient\r\nintendant of the province, who was almost the creator of modern\r\nBordeaux. Under his auspices the whole tribe of dolphins and heathen\r\ngods and goddesses were invoked to decorate the city. He reared great\r\nsweeps of pillared and porticoed buildings, and laid out broad streets\r\nand squares, on that enormous scale so characteristic of the _grand\r\nmonarque_. He made Bordeaux, indeed, at once vast, prim, and massively\r\nmagnificent. The mercantile town got quite a courtly air; and when the\r\ntricolor no longer floated in St. Domingo, and the commerce of the\r\nGironde declined, so that not much was left over and above the wine\r\ntrade, which, as all the world knows, is the genteelest of all the\r\ntraffics, Bordeaux became what it is--a sort of retired city, having\r\ndeclined business--quiet, and clean, and prim, and aristocratic. Such,\r\nat least, is the new town. With old Bordeaux, M. de Tournay meddled not;\r\nand when you plunge into its streets you leap at once from eighteenth\r\ncentury terraces into fourteenth century lanes and tortuous by-ways.\r\nBelow you, rough, ill-paved, unclean, narrow thoroughfares; above, the\r\nhanging old houses of five ages ago, peaked gables, and long projecting\r\neaves, and hanging balconies; quaint carvings in blackened wood and\r\nmouldering stone;--the true middle-age tenements, dreadfully ricketty,\r\nbut gloriously picturesque--charming to look at, but woful to live in;\r\ndeep black ravines of courts plunging down into the masses of piled up,\r\njammed together dwellings; squalid, slatternly people buzzing about like\r\nbees; bad smells permeating every street, lane, and alley; and now and\r\nthen the agglomeration of darksome dwellings clustering round a great\r\nold church, with its vast Gothic portals, and, high up, its carven\r\npinnacles and grinning _goutieres_, catching the sunshine far above the\r\nhighest of these high-peaked roofs. This is the Bordeaux of the English\r\nand the Gascons--the Bordeaux which has rung to the clash of armour--the\r\nBordeaux which was governed by a seneschal--the Bordeaux through whose\r\nstreets defiled,\r\n\r\n    \"With many a cross-bearer before,\r\n      And many a spear behind,\"\r\n\r\nthe christening procession of King Richard the Second.\r\n\r\nWe shall step into one church, and only one, that of the Feuillans.\r\nThere, upon a dark and massive pedestal, lies stretched the effigy of an\r\narmed man. His hands are clasped, his vizor up shows his peaked beard,\r\nand he is clad _cap-à-pied_ in steel. Who was the doughty warrior, thus\r\nresting in his mail? Strange to say, no warrior at all; but the quietest\r\nand most peaceable of God's beings. He had an odd, pedantic father, who\r\nbrought him up in strange Paganwise. The boy was never addressed but in\r\nLatin. He never had a mother-tongue. He was surrounded with a blockade\r\nof Latin speakers to keep afar off the profanation of French; he was\r\nmentally fed upon the philosophers and the poets of old Rome, and taught\r\nto weep for Seneca in the tub, as the nearest catastrophe which could\r\ntouch his sympathies. Furthermore, his father, out of respect for his\r\nnerves, had him awakened every morning by the sound of soft music.\r\nHappily, even this sublimity of pedantry and pedagoguism was\r\ninsufficient to ruin the native genius of Michael, Seigneur of\r\nMontaigne, whose \"essays ought to lie in every cottage window.\"\r\n\r\nI have said that I was in search of some one to introduce me to the\r\nvineyards and the vintagers. In a day or two I had pitched upon my\r\nlandlord as my protector. His hotel was a very modest one, where never\r\nbefore, I do believe, had Englishmen come to make everything dear and\r\ndisagreeable. The red boards of the aristocratic Murray were unknown in\r\nhis _salle à manger_. He hadn't an ounce of tea in his house, and very\r\nprobably, if he had, he would have fried it with butter, and served it\r\n_à la_ something or other. When I say he, however, I mean madame, not\r\nmonsieur. The latter would have made a capital English innkeeper, but he\r\nwas a very bad French one. My gentleman, who was more than six feet\r\nhigh, and a stately personage, was cut out for a \"mine host.\" He would\r\nhave presided in a bar--which means drinking a continued succession of\r\nglasses of ale--with uncommon effect, for his temperament was convivial\r\nand gossippy; but he had no vocation for the kitchen, which is the\r\ncommon sphere of a French innkeeper not of the first class, and where,\r\nunder the proud denomination of the _chef_, and clad in white like a\r\ngrimly ghost, he bustles among pipkins and stew-pans and skillets, and\r\nlifts little trap-doors in his smoky range, and peers down them at blue\r\ncharcoal furnaces--over which the _plats_ are simmering. Now my good\r\nlandlord never troubled himself about these domestic matters; but he was\r\nvery clever at standing on the outer steps of his door, smoking cigars;\r\nand, indeed, would stay very willingly there all day--at least, until he\r\nheard his wife's voice, upon which he would make a precipitate retreat\r\nto a neighbouring café, where he would drink _eau sucreé_ and rattle\r\ndominoes on a marble table till dinner-time. With this worthy I formed a\r\npersonal acquaintance, by buying from him, at the reasonable rate of six\r\nsous a-piece, a number of quaint brass-set flat stones, very like red\r\nand grey cornelians, and just as pretty, which it was the fashion in the\r\ndays of the Directory to mount in watch-keys, and wear two at a time,\r\none dangling from each fob. These stones are picked up in great\r\nquantities from the light shingly soil, whereon ripens the grape, which\r\nis pressed into claret wine; and handsome and lustrous in themselves,\r\nthey thus become a species of mementos of chateau Margaux and chateau\r\nLafitte. To the landlord, then, I stated that I wished to see some\r\nvine-gathering.\r\n\r\n\"Could anything be more lucky? His particular friend M. So-and-so was\r\nbeginning his harvesting that very day, and was going to give a dinner\r\nthat very night on the occasion. I should go--he should go. A friend of\r\nhis was M. So-and-so's friend; in fact, we were all friends together.\"\r\nThe truth I suspect to be, that my ally was dreadfully in want of an\r\nexcuse to go to the dinner, and he welcomed my application as the\r\nIsraelites did manna in the desert. It was meat and drink and amusement\r\nto him, and off we went.\r\n\r\nAs I shall presently describe the real claret vintage upon a large\r\nscale, I shall pass the more quickly over my first initiation into the\r\nplucking of the grapes. But I passed a merry day, and eke a busy one.\r\nThere are no idle spectators at a vintage--all the world must work; and\r\nso I speedily found myself, after being most cordially welcomed by a fat\r\nold gentleman, hoarse with bawling, in a pair of very dirty\r\nshirt-sleeves and a pouring perspiration--with a huge pair of scissors\r\nin my hand cutting off the bunches, in the midst of an uproarious troop\r\nof young men, young women, and children--threading the avenues between\r\nthe plants--stripping, with wonderful dexterity, the clustered\r\nbranches--their hands, indeed, gliding like dirty yellow serpents among\r\nthe broad green leaves--and sometimes shouting out merry badinage,\r\nsometimes singing bits of strongly rhythmed melody in chorus, and all\r\nthe time, as far as the feat could be effected, eating the grapes by\r\nhandfuls. The whole thing was very jolly; I never heard more laughing\r\nabout nothing in particular, more open and unblushing love-making, and\r\nmore resolute quizzing of the good man, whose grapes were going partly\r\ninto the baskets, tubs, pots, and pans, carried every few moments by the\r\nchildren and old people out of the green alleys to the pressing-tub, and\r\npartly into the capacious stomachs of the gatherers. At first I was\r\ndainty in my selection of the grapes to be chosen, eschewing the\r\nunder-ripe and the over-ripe. A damsel beside me observed this. From her\r\nwoolly hair and very dark but merry face, I imagined her to have a touch\r\nof Guadeloupe or Martinique blood. \"Cut away,\" she said; \"every grape\r\nmakes wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but the caterpillars--\"\r\n\r\n\"They give it a body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but the snails--\"\r\n\r\n\"O, save the snails, please do, for me!\" said a little girl, holding out\r\nher apron, full of painted shells.\r\n\r\n\"What do you do with them?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Boil them and eat them,\" said my juvenile friend.\r\n\r\nI looked askance.\r\n\r\n\"You cant think how nice they are with vinegar!\" said the mulatto girl.\r\n\r\nI remembered our own appetite for periwinkles, and said nothing; but\r\nadded my mite of snail-flesh to the collection.\r\n\r\nI was talking to the lord of the vineyard, when some one--there was\r\npetticoats in the case--dashed at him from behind, and instantly a\r\ncouple of hands clasped his neck, and one of them squashed a huge bunch\r\nof grapes over his mouth and nose, rubbing in the burst and bleeding\r\nfruit as vigorously as if it were a healing ointment, while streams of\r\njuice squirted from between the fingers of the fair assailant, and\r\nstreamed down the patron's equivocal shirt. After being half burked, the\r\ngood man shook his fist at the girl as she flew, laughing, down the\r\nalley; and then resuming his talk with me, he said: \"We call that,\r\n_Faire des moustaches_. We all do it at vintage time.\" And ten minutes\r\nthereafter I saw the jolly old boy go chasing an ancient crone of a\r\npail-bearer, a bunch of very ripe grapes in his hand, amid the delighted\r\nhurrahs of all assembled.\r\n\r\nDinner was late, for it behoves vintagers to make the best of the\r\ndaylight. The ordinary hired labourers dined, indeed, soon after noon;\r\nbut I am talking of the feast of honour. It was served in a\r\nthinly-furnished, stone-paved, damp and dismal _salle à manger_. A few\r\nadditional ladies with their beaux, grand provincial dandies, all of\r\nwhom tried to outstrip each other in the magnificence of their\r\nwaistcoats, had arrived from Bordeaux. It had been very hot, close\r\nweather for a day or two past, and everybody was imprecating curses on\r\nthe heads of the mosquitos. The ladies, to prove the impeachment,\r\nstripped their sleeves, and showed each other the bites on their brown\r\nnecks; and the gentlemen swore that the scamps were biting harder and\r\nharder. Then came the host, in a magnificently ill-cut coat--all the\r\nagricultural interest could not have furnished a worse--and his wife,\r\nvery red in the face, for she had cooked dinner for the vintagers and\r\nfor us; and then our host's father, a reverend old man in a black velvet\r\nscull cap, and long silver hair. The dinner was copious, and, as may be\r\nconceived, by no means served in the style of the _café de Paris_. But\r\n_soupe_, _bouilli_, _roti_, the stewed and the fried, speedily went the\r\nway of all flesh. Everybody _trinque-ed_ with everybody: the jingle of\r\nthe meeting glasses rose even over the clatter of the knives and forks;\r\nthe jolly host's heart grew warmer at every glass, and he issued\r\nimperious mandates for older and older wine. His comfortable wife, whose\r\nappetite had been affected by the cooking, made up for the catastrophe\r\nat the dessert. The old grandfather garulously narrated tales of\r\nwondrous vintages long ago. The waistcoats had all the scandal of\r\nBordeaux at their finger ends; and the young ladies with the mosquito\r\nbites took to \"making moustaches\" on their male friends, with pancakes\r\ninstead of grapes--a process by which the worthy host was, as usual, an\r\nespecial sufferer.\r\n\r\nAs may be conceived, my respected landlord was far more in his element\r\nthan at home with his wife. He eat more, drank more, talked more, and\r\nlaughed more than any two men present. Afterwards he grew tender and\r\nsentimental, and professed himself to be an ardent lover of his kind--a\r\nproposition which I suspect he afterwards narrowed specially in favour\r\nof a most mosquito-ridden lady next him--to the high wrath of a\r\nwaistcoat opposite, who said sarcastic and cutting things, which nobody\r\npaid any attention to; and the landlord, being really a good-looking\r\nand plausible fellow, went on conquering and to conquer, and drinking\r\nand being drunk to; until, under a glorious outburst of moonlight which\r\npaled the blinking candles on the table, the merry company broke up; and\r\nmine host of Bordeaux, after certain rather unsteady walking, suddenly\r\nstopped on the centre of the bridge, and refused to go further until he\r\nhad told me a secret. This was said with vast solemnity and aplomb, so\r\nwe paused together on the granite pavement, and, after looking\r\nmysteriously at the Garonne, the moon, and the dusky heights of Floriac,\r\nmy companion informed me in a hoarse whisper that he should leave\r\nFrance, his native and beloved land, where he felt sure that he was not\r\nappreciated, and pitch his tent, \"_la bas, en Angleterre, parceque les\r\nAnglais etaient si bons enfants!_\"\r\n\r\n\"So ho!\" thought I; \"a strange reminiscence of the old Gascons.\" But on\r\nthe morrow, my respectable entertainer had a bad headache, a yellow\r\nvisage, and an entire forgetfulness of how he had got home at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUSTACHE AT THE VINTAGE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCLARET--AND THE CLARET COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat our worthy forefathers in Guienne loved good wine, is a thing not\r\nto be doubted--even by a teetotaller. When the Earl of Derby halted his\r\ndetachments, he always had a pipe set on broach for the good of the\r\ncompany; and it is to be presumed that he knew their tastes. The wines\r\nof the Garonne were also, as might be expected, freely imported into\r\nEngland:\r\n\r\n     \"Whit wyn of Oseye, and of Gascoyne,\r\n     Of the Ruele, and of the Rochel wyn.\"\r\n\r\nAs far down, indeed, as Henry VIII.'s time you might get Gascony and\r\nGuienne wine for eightpence a gallon, and the comfortable word \"claret\"\r\nwas well known early in the seventeenth century. One of its admirers,\r\nhowever, about that time gave odd reasons for liking it, to wit--\"Claret\r\nis a noble wine, for it is the same complexion that noblemen's coats be\r\nof.\" This gentleman must have been a strenuous admirer of the\r\naristocracy. The old Gascon growth was, however, in all probability,\r\nwhat we should now call coarse, rough wine. The district which is\r\nblessed by the growth of Chateau Margaux and Chateau Lafitte, was a\r\nstony desert. An old French local book gives an account of the \"savage\r\nand solitary country of Medoc;\" and the wines of the Bordelais, there\r\nis every reason to believe, were grown in the strong, loamy soil\r\nbordering the river. By the time that the magic spots had been\r\ndiscovered, blessed with the mystic properties which produce the Queen\r\nof Wine we had been saddled with--our tastes perverted, and our stomachs\r\ndestroyed--by the woful Methuen treaty--heavy may it sit on the souls of\r\nQueen Anne, and all her wigged and powdered ministers--if, indeed, men\r\nwho preferred port wine to claret can be conceived to have had any souls\r\nat all, worth speaking about--and thenceforth John Bull burnt the coat\r\nof his stomach, muddled the working of his brain, made himself bilious,\r\ndyspeptic, headachy, and nationally stupid, by imbibing a mixture of\r\nstrong, coarse, wines, with a taste but no flavour, and bedevilled with\r\nevery alcoholic and chemical adulteration, which could make its natural\r\nqualities worse than they were. See how our literature fell off. The\r\nElizabethans quaffed sack, or \"Gascoyne, or Rochel wyn;\" and we had the\r\ngiants of those days. The Charles II. comedy writers worked on claret.\r\nPort came into fashion--port sapped our brains--and, instead of\r\nWycherly's _Country Wife_, and Vanbrugh's _Relapse_, we had Mr. Morton's\r\n_Wild Oats_, and Mr. Cherry's _Soldier's Daughter_. It is really much to\r\nthe credit of Scotland, that she stood staunchly by her old ally,\r\nFrance, and would have nothing to do with that dirty little slice of the\r\nworst part of Spain--Portugal, or her brandified potations. In the old\r\nScotch houses a cask of claret stood in the hall, nobly on the tap. In\r\nthe humblest Scotch country tavern, the pewter _tappit hen_, holding\r\nsome three quarts--think of that, Master Slender,--\"reamed,\" _Anglice_\r\nmantled, with claret just drawn from the cask, and you quaffed it,\r\nsnapping your fingers at custom-houses. At length, in an evil hour\r\nScotland fell:\r\n\r\n    \"Bold and erect the Caledonian stood,\r\n    Firm was his mutton, and his claret good;\r\n    'Let him drink port!' the English statesman cried.\r\n    He drank the poison, and his spirit died!\"\r\n\r\nBut enough of this painful subject. As Quin used to say, \"Anybody drink\r\nport? No! I thought so: Waiter, take away the black strap, and throw it\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the principle, I suppose, of the nearer the church, the further\r\nfrom God, Bordeaux is by no means a good place for good ordinary wine;\r\non the contrary, the stuff they give you for every-day tipple is\r\npositively poor, and very flavourless. In southern Burgundy, the most\r\nordinary of the wines is capital. At Macon, for a quarter of a handful\r\nof sous they give you nectar; at the little town of Tain, where the\r\nRhone sweeps gloriously round the great Hermitage rock, they give you\r\nsomething better than nectar for less. But the ordinary Bordeaux wine is\r\nvery ordinary indeed; not quite so red-inky, perhaps, as the _Vin de\r\nSurenne_, which, Brillat Savarin says, requires three men to swallow a\r\nglassful--the man who drinks, and the friends who uphold\r\nhim on either side, and coax, and encourage him; but still meagre and\r\nstarveling, as if it had been strained through something which took the\r\nvirtue out of it. Of course, the best of wine can be had by the simple\r\nprocess of paying for it, but I am talking of the ordinary work-a-day\r\ntipple of the place.\r\n\r\nA few days' lounging in Bordeaux over, and hearing that the vintage was\r\nin full operation, I put myself into a respectable little omnibus, and\r\nstarted for the true claret country. In a couple of hours I was put down\r\nat the door of the only auberge in the tiny village of Margaux, and to\r\nany traveller who may hereafter wish to visit the famous wine district,\r\nI cordially commend \"The Rising Sun,\" kept by the worthy \"Mere\r\nCadillac.\" There you will have a bedroom clean and bright as a Dutch\r\nparlour; a grand old four-poster of the ancient regime, something\r\nbetween a bed and a cathedral; a profusion of linen deliciously white\r\nand sweet smelling; and _la Mere_ will toss you up a nice little potage,\r\nand a cotelette done to a turn, and an omelette which is perfection; and\r\nshe will ask you, in the matter of wine, whether you prefer _ordinaire_\r\nor _vieux_? and when you reply, _Vieux et du meilleur_, she will\r\npresently bustle in with a glorious long-necked, cobwebby flask, the\r\nfirst glass of which will induce you to lean back in a tranquil state of\r\ngeneral happiness, and contemplate with satisfaction even the naughty\r\ndoings of the wicked Marguerite of Burgundy, and her sisters Blanche and\r\nHenriette, with Buridan and Gaulnay, in the _Tour de\r\nNesle_--illustrations of which popular tragedy deck the walls on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWhile thus agreeably employed, then, I may enlighten you with a few\r\ntopographical words about the claret district. Look at the map, and you\r\nwill observe a long tract of country, dotted with very few towns or\r\nvillages, called the Landes, stretching along the sea coast from the\r\nPyrenees to the mouth of the Gironde. At one place the Landes are almost\r\nsixty miles broad, but to the north they fine gradually away, the great\r\nriver Garonne shouldering them, as it were, into the sea. Now these\r\nLandes (into which we will travel presently) are, for the most part, a\r\nweary wilderness of pine-wood, morasses, sand-deserts, and barren\r\nshingle. On the other hand, the low banks of the Garonne are generally\r\nof a fat, loamy, and black soil, called, locally, _Palus_. Well, between\r\nthe Palus and the Landes, there is a longish strip of country from two\r\nto five miles broad, a low ridge or backbone, which may be said to be\r\nthe neutral and blending point of the sterile Landes and the fat and\r\nfertile Palus. And truth to tell, the earth seems as if the influence of\r\nthe latter had much to do to bear up against the former. A Norfolk\r\nfarmer would turn with a contemptuous laugh from the poor-looking stony\r\nsoil. \"Why,\" says he, \"it's all sand, and gravel, and shingle, and\r\nscorched with the sun. You would not get a blade of chickweed to grow\r\nthere.\" The proprietors of Medoc would be very glad if this latter\r\nassertion were correct, for the weeding of the vineyards form no\r\ninconsiderable item in the expense of cultivation; but this much may be\r\nsafely predicted of this strange soil, that it would not afford the\r\nnourishment to a patch of oats, which that modest grain manages to\r\nextract from the bare hill-side of some cold, bleak, Highland croft, and\r\nyet that it furnishes the influence which produces grapes yielding the\r\nmost truly generous and consummately flavoured wine ever drank by man\r\nsince Noah planted the first vine slip.\r\n\r\nYou have now finished the bottle of Vieux. Up, and let us out among the\r\nvineyards. A few paces clears us of the little hamlet of Margaux, with\r\nits constant rattle of busy coopers, and we are fairly in the country.\r\nTry to catch the general _coup d'oeil_. We are in an unpretending\r\npleasant-looking region, neither flat nor hilly--the vines stretching\r\naway around in gentle undulations, broken here and there by intervening\r\njungles of coppice-wood, by strips of black firs, or by the stately\r\navenues and ornamental woods of a first-class chateau. Gazing from the\r\nbottoms of the shallow valleys, you seem standing amid a perfect sea of\r\nvines, which form a monotonous horizon of unvaried green. Attaining the\r\nheight beyond, distant village spires rise into the air--the flattened\r\nroofs and white walls of scattered hamlets gleam cheerfully forth from\r\nembowering woods of walnut trees--and the expanse of the vineyards is\r\nbroken by hedged patches of meadow land, affording the crops of coarse\r\nnatural hay, upon which are fed the slowly-moving, raw-boned oxen which\r\nyou see dragging lumbering wains along the winding dusty way.\r\n\r\nAnd now look particularly at the vines. Nothing romantic in their\r\nappearance, no trellis work, none of the embowering, or the clustering,\r\nwhich the poets are so fond of. Here, in two words, is the aspect of\r\nsome of the most famous vineyards in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFancy open and unfenced expanses of stunted-looking, scrubby bushes,\r\nseldom rising two feet above the surface, planted in rows upon the\r\nsummit of deep furrow ridges, and fastened with great care to low,\r\nfence-like lines of espaliers, which run in unbroken ranks from one end\r\nof the huge fields to the other. These espaliers or lathes are cuttings\r\nof the walnut-trees around, and the tendrils of the vine are attached to\r\nthe horizontally running stakes with withes, or thongs of bark. It is\r\ncurious to observe the vigilant pains and attention with which every\r\ntwig has been supported without being strained, and how things are\r\narranged so as to give every cluster as fair a chance as possible of a\r\ngoodly allowance of sun. Such, then, is the general appearance of\r\nmatters; but it is by no means perfectly uniform. Now and then you find\r\na patch of vines unsupported, drooping, and straggling, and sprawling,\r\nand intertwisting their branches like beds of snakes; and again, you\r\ncome into the district of a new species of bush, a thicker, stouter\r\naffair, a grenadier vine, growing to at least six feet, and supported\r\nby a corresponding stake. But the low, two-feet dwarfs are invariably\r\nthe great wine givers. If ever you want to see a homily, not read, but\r\ngrown by nature, against trusting to appearances, go to Medoc and study\r\nthe vines. Walk and gaze, until you come to the most shabby, stunted,\r\nweazened, scrubby, dwarfish, expanse of snobbish bushes, ignominiously\r\nbound neck and crop to the espaliers like a man on the rack--these\r\nutterly poor, starved, and meagre-looking growths, allowing, as they do,\r\nthe gravelly soil to show in bald patches of grey shingle through the\r\nstraggling branches--these contemptible-looking shrubs, like paralysed\r\nand withered raspberries, it is which produce the most priceless, and\r\nthe most inimitably flavoured wines. Such are the vines which grow\r\nChateau Margaux at half a sovereign the bottle. The grapes themselves\r\nare equally unpromising. If you saw a bunch in Covent Garden you would\r\nturn from them with the notion that the fruiterer was trying to do his\r\ncustomer, with over-ripe black currants. Lance's soul would take no joy\r\nin them, and no sculptor in his senses would place such meagre bunches\r\nin the hands and over the open mouths of his Nymphs, his Bacchantes, or\r\nhis Fauns. Take heed, then, by the lesson, and beware of judging of the\r\nnature of either men or grapes by their looks. Meantime, let us continue\r\nour survey of the country. No fences or ditches you see--the ground is\r\ntoo precious to be lost in such vanities--only, you observe from time to\r\ntime a rudely carved stake stuck in the ground, and indicating the\r\nlimits of properties. Along either side of the road the vines extend,\r\nutterly unprotected. No raspers, no ha-ha's, no fierce denunciations of\r\ntrespassers, no polite notices of spring guns and steel traps constantly\r\nin a state of high go-offism--only, when the grapes are ripening, the\r\npeople lay prickly branches along the way-side to keep the dogs,\r\nforaging for partridges among the espaliers, from taking a refreshing\r\nmouthful from the clusters as they pass; for it seems to be a fact that\r\neverybody, every beast, and every bird, whatever may be his, her, or its\r\nnature in other parts of the world, when brought among grapes, eats\r\ngrapes. As for the peasants, their appetite for grapes is perfectly\r\npreposterous. Unlike the surfeit-sickened grocer's boys, who, after the\r\nfirst week loathe figs, and turn poorly when sugar-candy is hinted at,\r\nthe love of grapes appears literally to grow by what it feeds on. Every\r\ngarden is full of table vines. The people eat grapes with breakfast,\r\nlunch, dinner, and supper, and between breakfast, lunch, dinner, and\r\nsupper. The labourer plods along the road munching a cluster. The child\r\nin its mother's arms is tugging away with its toothless gums at a\r\nbleeding bunch; while as for the vintagers, male and female, in the less\r\nimportant plantations, Heaven only knows where the masses of grapes go\r\nto, which they devour, labouring incessantly at the _metier_, as they\r\ndo, from dawn till sunset.\r\n\r\nA strange feature in the wine country is the wondrously capricious and\r\nfitful nature of the soil. A forenoon's walk will show you the earth\r\naltering in its surface qualities almost like the shifting hues of shot\r\nsilk--gravel of a light colour fading into gravel of a dark--sand\r\nblending with the mould, and bringing it now to a dusky yellow, now to\r\nan ashen grey--strata of chalky clay every now and then struggling into\r\nlight only to melt away into beds of mere shingle--or bright\r\nsemi-transparent pebbles, indebted to the action of water for shape and\r\nhue. At two principal points these blending and shifting qualities of\r\nsoil put forth their utmost powers--in the favoured grounds of Margaux,\r\nand again, at a distance of about fifteen miles further to the north, in\r\nthe vineyards of Lafitte, Latour, and between these latter, in the sunny\r\nslopes of St. Jullien. And the strangest thing of all is, that the\r\nquality--the magic--of the ground changes, without, in all cases, a\r\ncorresponding change in the surface strata. If a fanciful and wilful\r\nfairy had flown over Medoc, flinging down here a blessing and there a\r\ncurse upon the shifting shingle, the effect could not have been more\r\noddly various. You can almost jump from a spot unknown to fame to\r\nanother clustered with the most precious vintage of Europe. Half-a-dozen\r\nfurrows often make all the difference between vines producing a beverage\r\nwhich will be drunk in the halls and palaces of England and Russia, and\r\nvines yielding a harvest which will be consumed in the cabarets and\r\nestaminets of the neighbourhood. It is to be observed, however, that the\r\nfirst-class wines belong almost entirely to the large proprietors. Amid\r\na labyrinth of little patches, the property of the labouring peasants\r\naround, will be a spot appertaining to, and bearing the name of, some of\r\nthe famous growths; while, conversely, inserted, as if by an accident,\r\nin the centre of a district of great name, and producing wine of great\r\nprice, will be a perverse patch, yielding the most commonplace tipple,\r\nand worth not so many sous per yard as the surrounding earth is worth\r\ncrowns.\r\n\r\nHow comes this? The peasants will tell you that it doesn't come at all.\r\nThat it is all cant and _blague_ and puff on the part of the big\r\nproprietors, and that their wine is only more thought of because they\r\nhave more capital to get it bragged about. Near Chateau Lafitte, on a\r\nburning afternoon, I took refuge beneath the emblematic bush; for the\r\nemblem which good wine is said not to require, is still, in the mid and\r\nsouthern districts of France, in universal use; in other words, I\r\nentered a village public-house.\r\n\r\nTwo old men, very much of the general type of the people of the\r\ncountry--that is, tall and spare, with intelligent and mildly-expressive\r\nfaces and fine black eyes, were discussing together a sober bottle. One\r\nof them had lost an arm, and the other a leg. As I glanced at this\r\npeculiarity, the one-legged man caught my eye.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"looking at our misfortunes; I left my leg on Waterloo.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" chimed in his companion, \"left my arm at Trafalgar.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sacré!_\" said the veteran of the land. \"One of the cursed English\r\nbullets took me in the knee, and spoiled as tight a lancer as they had\r\nin the gallant 10th.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" rejoined the other, \"was at the fourth main-deck gun of the\r\nPluton when I was struck with the splinter while we were engaging the\r\nMars. But we had our revenge. The Pluton shot the Mars' captain's head\r\noff!\"--a fact which I afterwards verified. Captain Duff, the officer\r\nalluded to, was thus killed upon his quarter-deck, and the same ball\r\nshattered two seamen almost to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"_Sacré!_\" said the _ci-devant_ lancer, \"I'd like to have a rap at the\r\nEnglish again--I would--the English--_nom de tonnerre_--tell me--didn't\r\nthey murder the emperor?\"\r\n\r\nA rising smile, which I could not help, stopped him. I had spoken so few\r\nwords, that the fact that a son of _perfide Albion_ was before them was\r\nonly manifested by the expression of my face.\r\n\r\n\"_Tiens!_\" continued the Waterloo man, \"_You_ are an Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nThe old sailor, who was evidently by no means so keen a hand as his\r\ncomrade, nudged him; a hint, I suppose, in common phrase, to draw it\r\nmild; but the ex-lancer of the 10th was not to be put down.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and if you are, what then, eh? I say I would like to have another\r\nbrush with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! We have had enough of brushes!\" said the far more pacific man\r\nof the sea. \"I think--_mon voisin_--that you and I have had quite enough\r\nof fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they killed the emperor. _Sacré nom de tous les diables_--they\r\nkilled the emperor.\"\r\n\r\nMy modest exculpation on behalf of Great Britain and Ireland was\r\nlistened to with great impatience by the maimed lancer, and great\r\nattention by the maimed sailor, who kept up a running commentary:\r\n\r\n\"_Eh! eh! entendez cela._ Now, that's quite different (to his friend)\r\nfrom what you tell us. Come--that's another story altogether; and what I\r\nsay is, that's reasonable.\"\r\n\r\nBut the lancer was not to be convinced--\"_Sacré bleu!_--they killed the\r\nemperor.\"\r\n\r\nAll this, it is to be observed, passed without the slightest feeling of\r\npersonal animosity. The lancer, who, I suspect, had passed the forenoon\r\nin the cabaret, every now and then shook hands with me magnanimously, as\r\nto show that his wrath was national--not individual; and when I proposed\r\na bottle of rather better wine than they had been drinking, neither\r\nsoldier nor sailor had a word to say in objection. The wine was brought,\r\nand very good it was, though not, of course, first-class claret.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of that?\" said the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had as good every day in England,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"And why haven't you?\" said the fierce lancer. \"You might, if you chose.\r\nBut you drink none of our wines.\"\r\n\r\nI demurred to this proposition; but the Waterloo man was down on me in\r\nno time. \"Yes, yes; the wines of the great houses--the great\r\nproprietors. _Sacré!_--the _farceurs_--the _blageurs_--who puff their\r\nwines, and get them puffed, and great prices for them, when they're not\r\nbetter than ours--the peasant's wines--when they're grown in the same\r\nground--ripened by the same sun! _Mille diables!_ Look at that\r\nbottle!--taste it! My son-in-law grew it. My son-in-law sells it; I know\r\nall about it. You shall have that bottle for ten sous, and the Lafitte\r\npeople and the Larose people would charge you ten francs for it; and it\r\nis as good for ten sous as theirs for ten francs. I tell you it grew\r\nside by side with their vines; but they have capital--they have power.\r\nThey crack off their wines, and we--the poor people!--we, who trim and\r\ndig and work our little patches--no one knows anything about us. Our\r\nwine--bah!--what is it? It has no name--no fame! Who will give us\r\nfrancs? No, no; sous for the poor man--francs for the rich. Copper for\r\nthe little landlord; silver--silver and gold for the big landlord! As\r\nour curé said last Sunday: 'Unto him who has much, more shall be given.'\r\n_Sacré Dieu de dieux!_--Even the Bible goes against the poor!\"\r\n\r\nAll this time, the old sailor was tugging his comrade's jacket, and\r\nuttering sundry deprecatory ejaculations against such unnecessary\r\nvehemence. The Trafalgar man was clearly a take-it-easy personage; not\r\ntroubled by too much thinking, and by no means a professional\r\ngrievance-monger. So he interposed to bring back the topic to a more\r\nsoothing subject, and said that what he would like, would be to see lots\r\nof English ships coming up the Gironde with the good cottons and\r\nwoollens and hardwares we made in England, and taking back in exchange\r\ntheir cheap and wholesome wines--not only the great vintages (_crus_)\r\nfor the great folk, but the common vintages for the common folk.\r\n\"Indeed, I think,\" he concluded, \"that sitting here drinking this good\r\nten sous' wine with this English gentleman--who's going to pay for\r\nit--is far better than fighting him and hacking him up, or his hacking\r\nus up, with swords and balls and so forth.\"\r\n\r\nTo this most sensible opinion we had all the pains in the world to get\r\nthe doughty lancer to incline. He couldn't see it at all. He would like\r\nto have another brush. He wasn't half done for yet. It was all very\r\nwell; but war was grand, and glory was grand. \"_Vive la guerre!_\" and\r\n\"_Vive la gloire!_\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the sailor, \"there is death in glory!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Eh bien!_\" shouted the warrior, with as perfect French sentiment as\r\never I heard, \"_Vive la mort!_\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, however, he was pleased to admit that, if we took the\r\npeasant wines, something might be made of us. The case was not utterly\r\nhopeless; and when I rose to go, he proposed a stirrup-cup--a _coup de\r\nl'étrier_--to the washing down of all unkindness; but, in the very act\r\nof swallowing it, he didn't exactly stop, but made a motion as if he\r\nwould, and then slowly letting the last drop run over his lips, he put\r\ndown the glass, and said, bitterly and coldly, \"_Mais pourtant, vous\r\navez tué l'Empereur!_\"\r\n\r\nI have introduced this episode principally for the purpose of showing\r\nthe notions entertained by the small proprietary as to the boasted\r\nsuperiority of the large vineyards; but the plain truth is, that the\r\ngreat growers are perfectly in the right. I have stated that the quality\r\nof the soil throughout the grape country varies almost magically. Well,\r\nthe good spots have been more or less known since Medoc was Medoc; and\r\nthe larger and richer residents have got them, by inheritance, by\r\nmarriage, and by purchase, almost entirely into their own hands. Next\r\nthey greatly improved both the soil and the breed of plants. They\r\nstudied and experimentalized until they found the most proper manures\r\nand the most promising cultures. They grafted and crossed the vine\r\nplants till they got the most admirably bearing bushes, and then,\r\ngeneration after generation, devoting all their attention to the quality\r\nof the wine, without regard to the quantity--scrupulously taking care\r\nthat not a grape which is unripe or over-ripe finds its way to the\r\ntub--that the whole process shall be scrupulously clean, and that every\r\nstage of fermentation be assiduously attended to--the results of all\r\nthis has been the perfectly-perfumed and high-class clarets, which fetch\r\nan enormous price; while the peasant proprietors, careless in\r\ncultivation, using old vine plants, anxious, at the vintage, only for\r\nquantity, and confined to the worst spots in the district, succeed in\r\nproducing wines which, good as they are, have not the slightest pretence\r\nto enter into competition with the liquid harvests of their richer and\r\nmore enlightened neighbours.\r\n\r\nBut it is high time to sketch, and with more elaboration than I have\r\nhitherto attempted, the claret vintage and the claret vintagers. Yet\r\nstill, for a moment, I must pause upon the threshold. Will it be\r\nbelieved--whether it will or not it is, nevertheless, true--that the\r\ncommencement of the vintage in France is settled, not by the opinion or\r\nthe convenience of the proprietors, but by the _autorités_ of each\r\n_arrondissement_? As September wanes and the grape ripens, the rural\r\nmayor assembles what he calls a jury of _experts_; which jury proceed,\r\nfrom day to day, through the vineyards, inspecting and tasting the\r\ngrapes and cross-questioning the growers; after which, they report to\r\nthe mayor a special day on which, having regard to all the vineyards,\r\nthey think that the vintage ought to commence. One proprietor, in a very\r\nsunny situation and a hot soil, may have been ready to begin a fortnight\r\nbefore; another, in a converse locality, may not be ready to commence\r\nfor a fortnight afterwards. _N'importe_--the French have a great notion\r\nof uniform symmetry and symmetrical uniformity, and so the whole\r\ndistrict starts together--the mayor issuing, _par autorité_, a\r\nhighly-official-looking document, which is duly posted by\r\nyellow-breeched _gens-d'armes_, and, before the appearance of which, not\r\na vine-grower can gather, for wine purposes, a single grape. Now, what\r\nmust be the common sense of a country which permits, for one instant,\r\nthe continuance of this wretched little tyrannical humbug? Only think of\r\na trumpery little mayor and a couple of beadles proclaiming to the\r\nfarmers of England that now they might begin to cut their wheat! The\r\nmayor's mace would be forced down the beadle's throat, and the beadle's\r\nstaff down the mayor's. But they manage these things--not\r\nexactly--better in France. What would France be without _les autorités_?\r\nCould the sun rise without a prefect? Certainly not. Could it set\r\nwithout a sub-prefect? Certainly not. Could the planets shine on France\r\nunless they were furnished with passports for the firmament? Clearly\r\nnot. Could the rain on France unless each drop came armed with the\r\n_visé_ of some wonderful bureau or other? Decidedly not. Well, then, how\r\ncould the vintage begin until the people, who know nothing about the\r\nvintage, command it? It is quite clear, that if you have any doubt\r\nabout these particulars, you know very little of the privileges, the\r\nrights, the functions, and the powers, of the \"authorities\" in France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VINTAGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE VINTAGE AND THE VINTAGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for preliminary information. Let us now proceed to the\r\njoyous ingathering of the fruits of the earth--the great yearly festival\r\nand jubilee of the property and the labour of Medoc. October, the \"wine\r\nmonth,\" is approaching. For weeks, every cloud in the sky has been\r\nwatched--every cold night breeze felt with nervous apprehension. Upon\r\nthe last bright weeks in summer, the savour and the bouquet of the wine\r\ndepend. Warmed by the blaze of an unclouded sun, fanned by the mild\r\nbreezes of the west, and moistened by morning and evening dews, the\r\ngrapes by slow degrees attain their perfect ripeness and their\r\nculminating point of flavour. Then the vintage implements begin to be\r\nsought out, cleaned, repaired, and scoured and sweetened with hot\r\nbrandy. Coopers work as if their lives depended upon their industry; and\r\nall the anomalous tribe of lookers-out for chance jobs in town and\r\ncountry pack up their bag and baggage, and from scores of miles around\r\npour in ragged regiments into Medoc.\r\n\r\nThere have long existed pleasing, and in some sort poetical,\r\nassociations connected with the task of securing for human use the\r\nfruits of the earth; and to no species of crop do these picturesque\r\nassociations apply with greater force than to the ingathering of the\r\nancient harvest of the vine. From time immemorial, the season has\r\ntypified epochs of plenty and mirthful-heartedness--of good fare and of\r\ngood-will. The ancient types and figures descriptive of the vintage are\r\nstill literally true. The march of agricultural improvement seems never\r\nto have set foot amid the vines. As it was with the patriarchs in the\r\nEast, so it is with the modern children of men. The goaded ox still\r\nbears home the high-pressed grape-tub, and the feet of the treader are\r\nstill red in the purple juice which maketh glad the heart of man. The\r\nscene is at once full of beauty, and of tender and even sacred\r\nassociations. The songs of the vintagers, frequently chorussed from one\r\npart of the field to the other, ring blithely into the bright summer\r\nair, pealing out above the rough jokes and hearty peals of laughter\r\nshouted hither and thither. All the green jungle is alive with the\r\nmoving figures of men and women, stooping among the vines or bearing\r\npails and basketfuls of grapes out to the grass-grown crossroads, along\r\nwhich the labouring oxen drag the rough vintage carts, groaning and\r\ncracking as they stagger along beneath their weight of purple tubs\r\nheaped high with the tumbling masses of luscious fruit. The congregation\r\nof every age and both sexes, and the careless variety of costume, add\r\nadditional features of picturesqueness to the scene. The white-haired\r\nold man labours with shaking hands to fill the basket which his\r\nblack-eyed imp of a grandchild carries rejoicingly away. Quaint\r\nbroad-brimmed straw and felt hats--handkerchiefs twisted like turbans\r\nover straggling elf locks--swarthy skins tanned to an olive-brown--black\r\nflashing eyes--and hands and feet stained in the abounding juices of the\r\nprecious fruit--all these southern peculiarities of costume and\r\nappearance supply the vintage with its pleasant characteristics. The\r\nclatter of tongues is incessant. A fire of jokes and jeers, of saucy\r\nquestions, and more saucy retorts--of what, in fact, in the humble and\r\nunpoetic but expressive vernacular, is called \"chaff,\"--is kept up with\r\na vigour which seldom flags, except now and then, when the butt-end of a\r\nsong, or the twanging close of a chorus strikes the general fancy, and\r\nprocures for the _morceau_ a lusty _encore_. Meantime, the master\r\nwine-grower moves observingly from rank to rank. No neglected bunch of\r\nfruit escapes his watchful eye. No careless vintager shakes the precious\r\nberries rudely upon the soil, but he is promptly reminded of his\r\nslovenly work. Sometimes the tubs attract the careful superintendent. He\r\nturns up the clusters to ascertain that no leaves nor useless length of\r\ntendril are entombed in the juicy masses, and anon directs his steps to\r\nthe pressing-trough, anxious to find that the lusty treaders are\r\npersevering manfully in their long-continued dance.\r\n\r\nThither we will follow. The wine-press, or _cuvier de pressoir_,\r\nconsists, in the majority of cases, of a massive shallow tub, varying in\r\nsize from four square feet to as many square yards. It is placed either\r\nupon wooden trestles or on a regularly-built platform of mason-work\r\nunder the huge rafters of a substantial outhouse. Close to it stands a\r\nrange of great butts, their number more or less, according to the size\r\nof the vineyard. The grapes are flung by tub and caskfuls into the\r\ncuvier. The treaders stamp diligently amid the masses, and the expressed\r\njuice pours plentifully out of a hole level with the bottom of the\r\ntrough into a sieve of iron or wickerwork, which stops the passage of\r\nthe skins, and from thence drains into tubs below. Suppose, at the\r\nmoment of our arrival, the cuvier for a brief space empty. The\r\ntreaders--big, perspiring men, in shirts and tucked-up\r\ntrowsers--spattered to the eyes with splatches of purple juice, lean\r\nupon their wooden spades, and wipe their foreheads. But their respite is\r\nshort. The creak of another cart-load of tubs is heard, and immediately\r\nthe waggon is backed up to the broad open window, or rather hole in the\r\nwall, above the trough. A minute suffices to wrench out tub after tub,\r\nand to tilt their already half-mashed clusters splash into the reeking\r\n_pressoir_. Then to work again. Jumping with a sort of spiteful\r\neagerness into the mountain of yielding quivering fruit, the treaders\r\nsink almost to the knees, stamping and jumping and rioting in the masses\r\nof grapes, as fountains of juice spurt about their feet, and rush\r\nbubbling and gurgling away. Presently, having, as it were, drawn the\r\nfirst sweet blood of the new cargo, the eager trampling subsides into a\r\nsort of quiet, measured dance, which the treaders continue, while, with\r\ntheir wooden spades, they turn the pulpy remnants of the fruit hither\r\nand thither, so as to expose the half-squeezed berries in every possible\r\nway to the muscular action of the incessantly moving feet. All this\r\ntime, the juice is flowing in a continuous stream into the tubs beneath.\r\nWhen the jet begins to slacken, the heap is well tumbled with the wooden\r\nspades, and, as though a new force had been applied, the juice-jet\r\nimmediately breaks out afresh. It takes, perhaps, half or three-quarters\r\nof an hour thoroughly to squeeze the contents of a good-sized cuvier,\r\nsufficiently manned. When at length, however, no further exertion\r\nappears to be attended with corresponding results, the tubfuls of\r\nexpressed juice are carried by means of ladders to the edges of the\r\nvats, and their contents tilted in; while the men in the trough,\r\nsetting-to with their spades, fling the masses of dripping grape-skins\r\nin along with the juice. The vats sufficiently full, the fermentation is\r\nallowed to commence. In the great cellars in which the juice is stored,\r\nthe listener at the door--he cannot brave the carbonic acid gas to enter\r\nfurther--may hear, solemnly echoing in the cool shade of the great\r\ndarkened hall, the bubblings and seethings of the working liquid--the\r\ninarticulate accents and indistinct rumblings which proclaim that a\r\ngreat metempsychosis is taking place--that a natural substance is rising\r\nhigher in the eternal scale of things, and that the contents of these\r\ngreat giants of vats are becoming changed from floods of mere mawkish,\r\nsweetish fluid to noble wine--to a liquid honoured and esteemed in all\r\nages--to a medicine exercising a strange and potent effect upon body and\r\nsoul--great for good and evil. Is there not something fanciful and\r\npoetic in the notion of this change taking place mysteriously in the\r\ndarkness, when all the doors are locked and barred--for the atmosphere\r\nabout the vats is death--as if Nature would suffer no idle prying into\r\nher mystic operations, and as if the grand transmutation and projection\r\nfrom juice to wine had in it something of a secret and solemn and awful\r\nnature--fenced round, as it were, and protected from vulgar curiosity by\r\nthe invisible halo of stifling gas? I saw the vats in the Chateau\r\nMargaux cellars the day after the grape-juice had been flung in.\r\nFermentation had not as yet properly commenced, so access to the place\r\nwas possible; still, however, there was a strong vinous smell loading\r\nthe atmosphere, sharp and subtle in its influence on the nostrils;\r\nwhile, putting my ear, on the recommendation of my conductor, to the\r\nvats, I heard, deep down, perhaps eight feet down in the juice, a\r\nseething, gushing sound, as if currents and eddies were beginning to\r\nflow, in obedience to the influence of the working Spirit, and now and\r\nthen a hiss and a low bubbling throb, as though of a pot about to boil.\r\nWithin twenty-four hours, the cellar would be unapproachable.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is quite foreign to my plan to enter upon anything like a\r\ndetailed account of wine-making. I may only add, that the refuse-skins,\r\nstalks, and so forth, which settle into the bottom of the fermentation\r\nvats, are taken out again after the wine has been drawn off and\r\nsubjected to a new squeezing--in a press, however, and not by the\r\nfoot--the products being a small quantity of fiery, ill-flavoured wine,\r\nfull of the bitter taste of the seeds and stalks of the grape, and\r\npossessing no aroma or bouquet. The Bordeaux press for this purpose is\r\nrather ingeniously constructed. It consists of a sort of a skeleton of a\r\ncask, strips of daylight shining through from top to bottom between the\r\nstaves. In the centre works a strong perpendicular iron screw. The\r\n_rape_, as the refuse of the treading is called, is piled beneath it;\r\nthe screw is manned capstan fashion, and the unhappy seeds, skins, and\r\nstalks, undergo a most dismal squeezing. Nor do their trials end there.\r\nThe wine-makers are terrible hands for getting at the very last\r\nget-at-able drop. To this end, somewhat on the principle of rinsing an\r\nexhausted spirit bottle, so as, as it were, to catch the very flavour\r\nstill clinging to the glass, they plunge the doubly-squeezed _rape_ into\r\nwater, let it lie there for a short time, and then attack it with the\r\npress again. The result is a horrible stuff called _piquette_, which, in\r\na wine country, bears the same resemblance to wine as the very dirtiest,\r\nmost wishy-washy, and most contemptible of swipes bears to honest porter\r\nor ale. Piquette, in fact, may be defined as the ghost of wine!--wine\r\nminus its bones, its flesh, and its soul!--a liquid shadow!--a fluid\r\nnothing!--an utter negation of all comfortable things and associations!\r\nNevertheless, however, the peasants swill it down in astounding\r\nquantities, and apparently with sufficient satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAnd now a word as to wine-treading. The process is universal in France,\r\nwith the exception of the cases of the sparkling wines of the Rhone and\r\nChampagne, the grapes for which are squeezed by mechanical means, not by\r\nthe human foot. Now, very venerable and decidedly picturesque as is the\r\nprocess of wine-treading, it is unquestionably rather a filthy one; and\r\nthe spectacle of great brown horny feet, not a whit too clean, splashing\r\nand sprawling in the bubbling juice, conveys at first sight a qualmy\r\nspecies of feeling, which, however, seems only to be entertained by\r\nthose to whom the sight is new. I looked dreadfully askance at the\r\noperation when I first came across it; and when I was invited--by a\r\nlady, too--to taste the juice, of which she caught up a glassful, a\r\ncertain uncomfortable feeling of the inward man warred terribly against\r\npoliteness. But nobody around seemed to be in the least squeamish. Often\r\nand often did I see one of the heroes of the tub walk quietly over a\r\ndunghill, and then jump--barefooted, of course, as he was--into the\r\njuice; and even a vigilant proprietor, who was particularly careful that\r\nno bad grapes went into the tub, made no objection. When I asked why a\r\npress was not used, as more handy, cleaner, and more convenient, I was\r\neverywhere assured that all efforts had failed to construct a wine-press\r\ncapable of performing the work with the perfection attained by the\r\naction of the human foot. No mechanical squeezing, I was informed, would\r\nso nicely express that peculiar proportion of the whole moisture of the\r\ngrape which forms the highest flavoured wine. The manner in which the\r\nfruit was tossed about was pointed out to me, and I was asked to\r\nobserve that the grapes were, as it were, squeezed in every possible\r\nfashion and from every possible side, worked and churned and mashed\r\nhither and thither by the ever-moving toes and muscles of the foot. As\r\nfar as any impurity went, the argument was, that the fermentation flung,\r\nas scum to the surface, every atom of foreign matter held in suspension\r\nin the wine, and that the liquid ultimately obtained was as exquisitely\r\npure as if human flesh had never touched it.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of these and such like particulars, I sauntered for\r\ndays among the vineyards around; and, utterly unknown and unfriended as\r\nI was, I met everywhere the most cordial and pleasant receptions. I\r\nwould lounge, for example, to the door of a wine-treading shed, to watch\r\nthe movements of the people. Presently the proprietor, most likely\r\nattired in a broad-brimmed straw hat, a strange faded outer garment,\r\nhalf shooting-coat half dressing gown, would come up courteously to the\r\nstranger, and, learning that I was an English visitor to the vintage,\r\nwould busy himself with the most graceful kindness, to make intelligible\r\nthe _rationale_ of all the operations. Often I was invited into the\r\nchateau or farm-house, as the case might be; a bottle of an old vintage\r\nproduced and comfortably discussed in the coolness of the darkened,\r\nthinly-furnished room, with its old-fashioned walnut-tree escrutoires,\r\nand beauffets, its quaintly-pannelled walls, and its polished floors,\r\ngleaming like mirrors and slippery as ice. On these occasions, the\r\nconversation would often turn upon the general rejection, by England, of\r\nFrench wines--a sore point with the growers of all save the first-class\r\nvintages, and in which I had, as may be conceived, very little to say in\r\ndefence either of our taste or our policy. In the evenings, which were\r\ngetting chill and cold, I occasionally abandoned my room with\r\nillustrations from the _Tour de Nesle_ for the general kitchen and\r\nparlour of Madame Cadillac, and, ensconcing myself in the chimney\r\ncorner--a fine old-fashioned ingle, crackling and blazing with hard wood\r\nlogs--listened to the chat of the people of the village; they were\r\nnearly all coopers and vine-dressers, who resorted there after the day's\r\nwork was over to enjoy an exceedingly modest modicum of very thin wine.\r\nI never benefitted very much, however, by these listenings. It was my\r\nbad luck to hear recounted neither tale nor legend--to pick up, at the\r\nhands of my _compotatores_, neither local trait nor anecdote. The\r\nconversation was as small as the wine. The gossip of the place--the\r\nprospects of the vintage--elaborate comparisons of it with other\r\nvintages--births, marriages, and deaths--a minute list of scandal, more\r\nor less intelligible when conveyed in hints and allusions--were the\r\nstaple topics, mixed up, however, once or twice with general\r\ndenunciations of the niggardly conduct of certain neighbouring\r\nproprietors to their vintagers--giving them for breakfast nothing but\r\ncoarse bread, lard, and not even piquette to wash it down with, and for\r\ndinner not much more tempting dishes.\r\n\r\nIn Medoc, there are two classes of vintagers--the fixed and the floating\r\npopulation; and the latter, which makes an annual inroad into the\r\ndistrict just as the Irish harvesters do into England and Scotland,\r\ncomprising a goodly proportion of very dubious and suspicious-looking\r\ncharacters. The _gen-d'armerie_ have a busy time of it when these gentry\r\nare collected in numbers in the district. Poultry disappear with the\r\nmost miraculous promptitude; small linen articles hung out to dry have\r\nno more chance than if Falstaff's regiment were marching by; and\r\ngarden-fruit and vegetables, of course, share the results produced by a\r\nrigid application of the maxim that _la propriété c'est le vol_. Where\r\nthese people come from is a puzzle. There will be vagrants and strollers\r\namong them from all parts of France--from the Pyrenees and the\r\nAlps--from the pine-woods of the Landes and the moors of Brittany. They\r\nunite in bands of a dozen or a score men and women, appointing a chief,\r\nwho bargains with the vine-proprietor for the services of the company,\r\nand keeps up some degree of order and subordination, principally by\r\nmeans of the unconstitutional application of a good thick stick. I\r\nfrequently encountered these bands, making their way from one district\r\nto another, and better samples of \"the dangerous classes\" were never\r\ncollected. They looked vicious and abandoned, as well as miserably poor.\r\nThe women, in particular, were as brazen-faced a set of slatterns as\r\ncould be conceived; and the majority of the men--tattered,\r\nstrapping-looking fellows, with torn slouched hats, and tremendous\r\ncudgels--were exactly the sort of persons a nervous gentleman would have\r\nscruples about meeting at dusk in a long lane. It is when thus on the\r\ntramp that the petty pilfering and picking and stealing to which I have\r\nalluded to goes on. When actually at work, they have no time for\r\npicking up unconsidered trifles. Sometimes these people pass the\r\nnight--all together, of course--in out-houses or barns, when the _chef_\r\ncan strike a good bargain; at other times they bivouac on the lee-side\r\nof a wood or wall, in genuine gipsy fashion. You may often see their\r\nwatchfires glimmering in the night; and be sure that where you do, there\r\nare twisted necks and vacant nests in many a neighbouring hen-roost. One\r\nevening I was sauntering along the beach at Paulliac--a little town on\r\nthe river's bank, about a dozen of miles from the mouth of the Gironde,\r\nand holding precisely the same relation to Bordeaux as Gravesend does to\r\nLondon--when a band of vintagers, men, women, and children, came up.\r\nThey were bound to some village on the opposite side of the Gironde, and\r\nwanted to get ferried across. A long parley accordingly ensued between\r\nthe chief and a group of boatmen. The commander of the vintage forces\r\noffered four sous per head as the passage-money. The bargemen would hear\r\nof nothing under five; and after a tremendous verbal battle, the\r\nvintagers announced that they were not going to be cheated, and that if\r\nthey could not cross the water, they could stay where they were.\r\nAccordingly, a bivouac was soon formed. Creeping under the lee of a row\r\nof casks, on the shingle of the bare beach, the women were placed\r\nleaning against the somewhat hard and large pillows in question; the\r\nchildren were nestled at their feet and in their laps; and the men\r\nformed the outermost ranks. A supply of loaves was sent for and\r\nobtained. The chief tore the bread up into huge hunks, which he\r\ndistributed to his dependents; and upon this supper the whole party\r\nwent coolly to sleep--more coolly, indeed, than agreeably; for a keen\r\nnorth wind was whistling along the sedgy banks of the river, and the red\r\nblaze of high-piled faggots was streaming from the houses across the\r\nblack, cold, turbid waters. At length, however, some arrangement was\r\ncome to; for, on visiting the spot a couple of hours afterwards, I found\r\nthe party rather more comfortably ensconced under the ample sails of the\r\nbarge which was to bear them the next morning to their destination.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-party formed every day, when the process of stripping the\r\nvines is going on, is, particularly in the cases in which the people are\r\ntreated well by the proprietor, frequently a very pretty and very\r\npicturesque spectacle. It always takes place in the open air, amongst\r\nthe bushes, or under some neighbouring walnut-tree. Sometimes long\r\ntables are spread upon tressles; but in general no such formality\r\nis deemed requisite. The guests fling themselves in groups upon the\r\nground--men and women picturesquely huddled together--the former bloused\r\nand bearded personages--the latter showy, in their bright short\r\npetticoats of home-spun and dyed cloth, with glaring handkerchiefs\r\ntwisted like turbans round their heads--each man and woman with a deep\r\nplate in his or her lap. Then the people of the house bustle about,\r\ndistributing huge brown loaves, which are torn asunder, and the\r\nfragments chucked from hand to hand. Next a vast cauldron of soup,\r\nsmoking like a volcano, is painfully lifted out from the kitchen, and\r\ndealt about in mighty ladlefuls; while the founder of the feast takes\r\ncare that the tough, thready _bouilli_--like lumps of boiled-down\r\nhemp--shall be fairly apportioned among his guests. _Piquette_ is the\r\ngeneral beverage. A barrel is set abroach, and every species of mug,\r\nglass, cup, and jug about the establishment is called in to aid in its\r\nconsumption. A short rest, devoted to chatting, or very often sleeping\r\nin the shade, over, the signal is given, and the work recommences.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen our _salle à manger_,\" said one of my courteous\r\nentertainers--he of the broad-brimmed straw hat; \"and now you shall see\r\nour _chambre à coucher_.\" Accordingly, he led me to a barn close to his\r\nwine-cellars. The place was littered deep with clean, fresh straw. Here\r\nand there rolled-up blankets were laid against the wall; while all\r\nround, from nails stuck in between the bare bricks, hung by straps and\r\nstrings the little bundles, knapsacks, and other baggage of the\r\nlabourers. On one side, two or three swarthy young women were playfully\r\npushing each other aside, so as to get at a morsel of cracked mirror\r\nstuck against the wall--their long hair hanging down in black elf-locks,\r\nin the preliminary stage of its arrangement.\r\n\r\n\"That is the ladies' side,\" said my _cicerone_, pointing to the girls;\r\n\"and that\"--extending his other hand--\"is the gentlemen's side.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so they all sleep here together?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every night. I find shelter and straw; any other accommodation they\r\nmust procure for themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather unruly, I should suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit. They are too tired to do anything but sleep. They go off,\r\nsir, like dormice.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Oh, sil plait à Mossieu!_\" put in one of the damsels. \"The chief of\r\nthe band does the police.\" (_Fait la gen-d'armerie._)\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--certainly,\" said the proprietor; \"the gentlemen lie here,\r\nwith their heads to the wall; the ladies there; and the _chef de la\r\nbande_ stretches himself all along between them.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sort of living frontier?\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly; and he allows no nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Il est meme éxcessivement severe_,\" interpolated the same young lady.\r\n\r\n\"He need be,\" replied her employer. \"He allows no loud speaking--no\r\njoking; and as there are no candles, no light, why, they can do nothing\r\nbetter than go quietly to sleep, if it were only in self-defence.\"\r\n\r\nOne word more about the vintage. The reader will easily conceive that it\r\nis on the smaller properties, where the wine is intended, not so much\r\nfor commerce as for household use, that the vintage partakes most of the\r\nfestival nature. In the large and first-class vineyards the process goes\r\non under rigid superintendence, and is as much as possible made a cold\r\nmatter of business. He who wishes to see the vintages of books and\r\npoems--the laughing, joking, singing festivals amid the vines, which we\r\nare accustomed to consider the harvests of the grape--must betake him to\r\nthe multitudinous patches of peasant property, in which neighbour helps\r\nneighbour to gather in the crop, and upon which whole families labour\r\nmerrily together, as much for the amusement of the thing, and from good\r\nneighbourly feeling, as in consideration of francs and sous. Here, of\r\ncourse, there is no tight discipline observed, nor is there any absolute\r\nnecessity for that continuous, close scrutiny into the state of the\r\ngrapes--all of them hard or rotten, going slap-dash into the\r\n_cuvier_--which, in the case of the more precious vintages, forms no\r\nsmall check upon a general state of careless jollity. Every one eats as\r\nmuch fruit as he pleases, and rests when he is tired. On such occasions\r\nit is that you hear to the best advantage the joyous songs and choruses\r\nof the vintage--many of these last being very pretty bits of melody,\r\ngenerally sung by the women and girls, in shrill treble unison, and\r\ncaught up and continued from one part of the field to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RETURNING FROM THE VINTAGE.]\r\n\r\nYet, discipline and control it as you will, the vintage will ever be\r\nbeautiful, picturesque, and full of association. The rude wains,\r\ncreaking beneath the reeking tubs--the patient faces of the yoked\r\noxen--the half-naked, stalwart men, who toil to help the cart along the\r\nruts and furrows of the way--the handkerchief-turbaned women, their gay,\r\nred-and-blue dresses peeping from out the greenery of the leaves--the\r\nchildren dashing about as if the whole thing were a frolic, and the\r\ngrey-headed old men tottering cheerfully adown the lines of vines, with\r\nbaskets and pails of gathered grapes to fill the yawning tubs--the whole\r\npicture is at once classic, venerable, and picturesque, not more by\r\nassociation than actuality.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Reader, luxuriating amid the gorgeously carven and emblazoned\r\nfittings of a Palais Royal or Boulevard restorateur, Vefours, the\r\nFreres, or the Café de Paris; or perhaps ensconced in our quieter and\r\nmore sober rooms--dim and dull after garish Paris, but ten times more\r\ncomfortable in their ample sofas and carpets, into which you sink as\r\ninto quagmires, but with more agreeable results,--snugly, Reader,\r\nensconced in either one or the other locality, after the waiter has, in\r\nobedience to your summons, produced the _carte de vins_, and your eye\r\nwanders down the long list of tempting nectars, Spanish and Portuguese,\r\nand better, far better, German and French--have you ever wondered as you\r\nread, \"ST. JULLIEN, LEOVILLE, CHATEAU LA LAFITTE, CHATEAU LA ROSE, and\r\nCHATEAU MARGAUX, what these actual vineyards, the produce of which you\r\nknow so well--what those actual chateaux, which christen such glorious\r\ngrowths, resemble?\" If so, listen, and I will tell you.\r\n\r\nAs you traverse the high road from Bordeaux to Pauillac, some one will\r\nprobably point out to you a dozen tiny sugar-loaf turrets, each\r\nsurmounted by a long lightning-conductor, rising from a group of noble\r\ntrees. This is the chateau St. Jullien. A little on, on the right side\r\nof the way, rises, from the top of a tiny hill overlooking the Gironde,\r\na new building, with all the old crinkum-crankum ornaments of the\r\nancient fifteenth century country house. That is the chateau Latour.\r\nPresently you observe that the entrance to a wide expanse of vines,\r\ncovering a series of hills and dales, tumbling down to the water's edge,\r\nis marked by a sort of triumphal arch or ornamented gate, adorned with a\r\nlion couchant, and a legend, setting forth that the vines behind produce\r\nthe noted wine of Leoville. The chateau Lafitte rises amid stately\r\ngroves of oak and walnut-trees, from amid the terraced walks of an\r\nItalian garden--its white spreading wings gleaming through the trees,\r\nand its round-roofed, slated towers rising above them. One chateau, the\r\nmost noted of all, remains. Passing along a narrow, sandy road, amid a\r\nwaste of scrubby-looking bushes, you pass beneath the branches of a\r\nclump of noble oaks and elms, and perceive a great white structure\r\nglimmering garishly before you. Take such a country house as you may\r\nstill find in your grandmothers' samplers, decorated with a due\r\nallowance of doors and windows--clap before it a misplaced Grecian\r\nportico, whitewash the whole to a state of the most glaring and dazzling\r\nbrightness, carefully close all outside shutters, painted white\r\nlikewise--and you have chateau Margaux rising before you like a wan,\r\nghastly spectre of a house, amid stately terraced gardens, and trimmed,\r\nclipped, and tortured trees. But, as I have already insisted, nothing,\r\nin any land of vines, must be judged by appearances. The first time I\r\nsaw at a distance Johannesberg, rising from its grape-clustered domains,\r\nI thought it looked very much like a union workhouse, erected in the\r\nmidst of a field of potatoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDES SHEPHERDS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LANDES--THE BORDEAUX AND TESTE RAILWAY--NINICHE--THE LANDSCAPE\r\nOF THE LANDES--THE PEOPLE OF THE LANDES--HOW THEY WALK ON STILTS,\r\nAND GAMBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurn to the map of France--to that portion of it which would be\r\ntraversed by a straight line drawn from Bordeaux to Bayonne--and you\r\nwill observe that such a line would run through a vast extent of\r\nbare-looking country--of that sort, indeed, where\r\n\r\n    \"Geographers on pathless downs\r\n    Place elephants, for want of towns.\"\r\n\r\nRoads, you will observe, are few and far between; the names of\r\nfar-scattered towns will be unfamiliar to you; and, indeed, nine-tenths\r\nof this part of the map consists of white paper. The district you are\r\nlooking at is the Landes, forming now a department by itself, and\r\nanciently constituting a portion of Gascony and Guienne. These Landes\r\nform one of the strangest and wildest parts of France. Excepting here\r\nand there small patches of poor, ill-cultivated land, the whole country\r\nis a solitary desert--black with pine-wood, or white with\r\nvast plains of drifting sand. By these two great features of the\r\ndistrict, occasionally diversified by sweeps of green morass,\r\nintersected by canals and lanes of stagnant and often brackish water,\r\nthe Landes take a goodly slice out of La Belle France. Their sea-line\r\nbounds the French side of the Bay of Biscay, stretching from Bayonne to\r\nthe mouth of the Gironde; and at their point of greatest breadth they\r\nrun some sixty miles back into the country; thence gradually receding\r\naway towards the sea, as though pushed back by the course of the\r\nGaronne, until, towards the mouth of the river, they fade away\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nSo much for the _physique_ of the Landes. The inhabitants are every whit\r\nas rugged, strange, and uncultivated. As the Landes were four centuries\r\nago, in all essential points, so they are now; as the people were four\r\ncenturies ago, in all essential points, so they are now. What should the\r\ntide of progress or of improvement do in these deserts of pine and sand?\r\nThe people live on French soil, but cannot be called Frenchmen. They\r\nspeak a language as unintelligible to a Frenchman as an Englishman; they\r\nhave none of the national characteristics--little, perhaps, of the\r\nnational blood. They are saturnine, gloomy, hypochondriac, dismally\r\npassing dismal lives in the depths of their black forests, their dreary\r\nswamps, and their far-spreading deserts of white, fine sand. Such an odd\r\nnook of the world was not to be passed unvisited; besides, I wanted to\r\nsee the Biscay surf; and accordingly I left Bordeaux for the Landes--not\r\nin some miserable cross-country vehicle--not knight-errantwise, on a\r\nBordelais Rosinante--not pilgrim-wise, with a staff and scrip--but in a\r\ncomfortable railway-carriage.\r\n\r\nYes, sir, a comfortable railway-carriage; and the railway in\r\nquestion--the Bordeaux and Teste line--is the sole enterprise of the\r\nkind undertaken and achieved in the south-west of France.\r\n\r\n\"Railways!\" said the conductor of the Paris and Bordeaux diligence to\r\nme, with that magnificent condescension with which a Frenchman explains\r\nto a Briton all about _Perfide Albion!_--\"Railways, monsieur,\" he said,\r\n\"as all the world knows, have achieved the ruin of the Old England, and\r\npresently they will do as much for France. _Tenez_; they are cursed\r\ninventions--particularly the Paris and Bordeaux Railway.\"\r\n\r\nBut if the ruin of France is to be consummated by railways, France, like\r\nbankrupt linendrapers, will take a long time to ruin. The Bordeaux line\r\ncrawls but slowly on. In 1850, we left the rails and took to the road at\r\nTours; and, barring the bits of line leading down from some of the\r\nMediterranean towns to Marseilles, the Bordeaux and Teste fragment was\r\nthe sole morsel of railway then in operation south of Lyons. The\r\nquestion comes, then, to be, What earthly inducement caused the\r\nconstruction of this wilderness line, and how it happens that the only\r\nlocomotives in fair Guienne whistle through the almost uninhabited\r\nLandes? The fact seems to be, that, once upon a time, the good folks of\r\nBordeaux were taken with an inappeasable desire to have a railway. One\r\nwould have thought that the natural course of such an undertaking would\r\nhave been northward, through the vines and thickly-peopled country of\r\nMedoc to the comparatively-important towns of Paulliac and Lesparre. The\r\nenterprising Bordelais, however, had another scheme. Some forty miles to\r\nthe west of the city, the sands, pines, and morasses of the Landes are\r\nbroken by a vast shallow basin, its edges scolloped with innumerable\r\ncreeks, bays, and winding friths, into which, through a breach in the\r\ncoast line of sand-hills, flow the waters of the Atlantic. On the\r\nsouthern side of this estuary lie two or three scattered groups of\r\nhovels, inhabited by fishermen and shepherds--the most important of the\r\nhamlets being known as Teste, or Teste-la-buch. Between Teste and\r\nBordeaux, the only line of communication was a rutty road, half sand and\r\nhalf morass, and the only traffic was the occasional pilgrimage to the\r\nsalt water of some patient sent thither at all risks by the Bordeaux\r\ndoctors, or now and then the transit towards the city of the Garonne of\r\nthe products of a day's lucky fishing, borne in panniers on the backs of\r\na string of donkeys. Folks, however, were sanguine. The speculation\r\n\"came out,\" shares got up, knowing people sold out, simple people held\r\non, and the line was actually constructed. No doubt it was cheaply got\r\nup. Ground could be had in the Landes almost for the asking, and from\r\nterminus to terminus there is not an inch of tunnel-cutting or\r\nembankment. The line, moreover, is single, and the stations are knocked\r\nup in the roughest and most primitive style. The result, however,\r\nastonished no one, save the shareholders. The traffic does not half pay\r\nthe working expenses. Notwithstanding that some increase in the amount\r\nof communication certainly did take place, consequent upon the facility\r\nwith which Teste can now be reached--a facility which has gone some way\r\nto render it a summer place of sea-side resort--the two trains which\r\n_per diem_ seldom convey more than a dozen or so of third-class\r\npassengers, and the shareholders at length flung themselves into the\r\nhands of the Government; and, insisting upon the advantages which would\r\naccrue to the State as soon as the Paris and Bordeaux line was finished,\r\nby a direct means of communication between the metropolis and a harbour\r\nin the Bay of Biscay, they succeeded in hypothecating their line to the\r\nGovernment for a small annual subvention. Such is the present agreeable\r\nposition of the single railway in the south-west of France.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat late, as I feared, for the train, and, calling a\r\n_citadine_, got the man to urge his horse to a gallop, so that we pulled\r\nup at the terminus with the animal in a lather. A porter approached, and\r\ngrinned. \"Monsieur has made haste, but the winter season begins to-day,\r\nand the train does not go for an hour and a half.\" There was no help for\r\nit, and I sauntered into the nearest _café_ to read long disquisitions\r\non what was then all the vogue in the political world--the \"situation.\"\r\nI found the little marble slabs deserted--even the billiard-table\r\nabandoned, and all the guests collected round the white Fayence stove.\r\nJoining them, I perceived the attraction. On one of the velvet stools\r\nsat an old gentleman of particularly grave and reverend aspect--a most\r\nphilosophic and sage-like old gentleman--and between his legs was a\r\nwhite poodle, standing erect with his master's cane in his paws. All the\r\ncompany were in raptures with Niniche, who was going through his\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\n\"Niniche,\" said the patriarch, \"what does Monsieur Tetard do when he\r\ncomes home late?\"\r\n\r\nThe dog immediately began to stagger about on its hind legs, sometimes\r\nlosing its balance and then getting up again, looking all the time with\r\na sort of stupid blinking stare at its master. It was clear that M.\r\nTetard, when he came home late, did not come home sober.\r\n\r\n\"_Tiens! c'est admirable!_\" shouted the spectators--burly fellows, with\r\nblack beards, and honest tradesman-looking people, with glasses of _eau\r\nsucreé_ in their hands.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said the old gentleman, the poodle's proprietor and\r\ninstructor, \"what does Madame Tetard do when Monsieur Tetard comes home\r\nlate?\"\r\n\r\nThe dog straightway began to utter, with wonderful volubility, a series\r\nof loud, shrill, yelping snaps, jerking itself up and down on its\r\nhaunches, and flinging its paws about as if it had the hydrophobia. The\r\nspectators were enraptured. \"It is actually her voice,\" said one. \"Only\r\nthe dog is too good-looking for her,\" said another. \"_Voilà petite!_\"\r\nvociferated a third, holding a huge piece of bluish-tinted beetroot\r\nsugar to the performer, when suddenly the group was broken by a fussy,\r\nfat old gentleman with a white baggy cravat, very snuffy, and a pair of\r\nheavy gold spectacles.\r\n\r\n\"_Je dis--moi!_\" shouted the new comer, in violent wrath; \"_que c'est\r\nabominable ce que vous faites là Père Grignon._\" A murmur of suppressed\r\nlaughter went through the group. Père Grignon looked considerably taken\r\naback, and the speaker aimed a hearty kick at Niniche, who dodged away\r\nround the stove. It was evident that he was no other than the injured\r\nand maligned Tetard himself. Instantly he broke into loud objurgations.\r\nHe knew how that atrocious old _Père Grignon_ had taught his dog to\r\nmalign him, the _bête misérable_! But as for it, he would poison\r\nit--shoot it--drown it; and as for Père Grignon, who ought to have more\r\nsense, all the quartier knew what he was--an _imbécille_, who was always\r\nrunning about carrying tales, and making mischief. But he would appeal\r\nto the authorities; he would lay his complaint before the commisary of\r\nthe quartier; he would--he would--. At this moment the excited orator\r\ncaught sight of the offending poodle slipping to the door, and instantly\r\nsprung vigorously after him:--\r\n\r\n\"_Tenez-tenez_; don't touch Niniche--it's not his fault!\" exclaimed the\r\npoodle's proprietor. But the dog had bolted, with Tetard in hot chase of\r\nhis imitator, and vowing that he should be _écraséd_ and _abiméd_ as\r\nsoon as caught. There was, of course, great laughter at the whole\r\nproceeding; and then the group betook themselves to the marble slabs\r\nand dominoes--the instructor of the offending quadruped coolly lighting\r\nhis pipe, as he muttered that old Tetard was, after all, a _bon enfant_,\r\nand that over a _petit verre_ he would always listen to reason.\r\n\r\nAt length the tedious hour and a half wore away, and I entered the\r\nterminus--a roughly built wooden shed. The train consisted of a first,\r\nsecond, and third-class carriage; but there were no first-class\r\npassengers, only one solitary second-class, and about a dozen\r\nthird-classes, with whom I cast my lot. Miserable as the freight was,\r\nthe locomotive whistled as loud and panted as vehemently as if it were\r\nyoked to a Great Western express; and off we went through the broad belt\r\nof nursery gardens, which encircles every French town, and where the\r\nvery best examples of the working of the small proprietary system are to\r\nbe seen. A rapid run through the once greatly famed and still esteemed\r\nvineyards of Hautbrion, and we found ourselves scurrying along over a\r\nnegative sort of country--here a bit of heath, there a bit of\r\nvineyard--now a bald spot of sand, anon a plot of irregularly-cut\r\nstubble; while a black horizon of pine-wood rose gradually on the right\r\nand left. On flew the train, and drearier grew the landscape; the heath\r\nwas bleaker--the pines began to appear in clumps--the sand-stretches\r\ngrew wider--every thing green, and fertile, and _riant_ disappeared. He,\r\nindeed, who enters the Landes, appears to have crossed a French\r\nfrontier, and left the merry land behind. No more bright vineyards--no\r\nmore rich fields of waving corn--no more clustered villages--no more\r\nchateau-turrets--no more tapering spires. You look up to heaven to see\r\nwhether the sky has not changed, as well as the land. No; all there is\r\nblue and serene as before, and the keen, hot sun glares intensely down\r\nupon undulating wastes of marsh, fir, and sand, among which you may\r\ntravel for leagues without seeing a man, hearing a dog bark, or a bird\r\nsing. At last we were fairly among the woods, shooting down what seemed\r\nan eternal straight tunnel, cleft by lightning through the pines. The\r\ntrees stood up stark and stiff, like cast-iron; the fir is at once a\r\nsolemn and a rigid tree--the Puritan of the forest; and down the side of\r\neach Puritan I noticed a straight, yellowish gash, running\r\nperpendicularly from the spread of the branches almost to the earth, and\r\nturned for explanation to an intelligent-looking man, evidently a\r\ncitizen of Bordeaux, opposite me.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"you are new to our Landes.\"\r\n\r\nI admitted it.\r\n\r\n\"And these gashes down the trees--these, monsieur, give us the harvest\r\nof the Landes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The harvest! What harvest?\"\r\n\r\n\"What harvest? Resin, to be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, resin,\" said an old fellow with a blouse and a quick eye; \"resin,\r\nmonsieur; the only harvest that man can grow in sand.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Tenez_,\" said my first interlocutor; \"the peasants cut that gash in\r\nthe tree; and at the root they scoop a little hollow in the ground. The\r\nresin perspires out of the wood, flows slowly and glutinously down the\r\ngash, and in a month or so, according to the heat of the weather, the\r\nhole is full, and the man who rents the trees takes up the sticky stuff,\r\nlike soup, with a ladle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a very good description,\" said the old bloused gentleman. \"And\r\nthen, sir\" (addressing me), \"we barrel our crop of the Landes. Yes,\r\nindeed, we barrel it, as well as they do the crop of the Medoc.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only you wouldn't like to drink it so well,\" said the Bordeaux man.\r\n\r\nPresently we pulled up at a station--a mere shed, with a clearing around\r\nit, as there might have been in Texas or Maine. I observed the\r\nname--TOHUA-COHOA, and remarked that it did not look like a French one.\r\n\r\n\"French one!\" said he of Bordeaux; \"you don't expect to find French in\r\nthis chaos? No, no; it is some of the gibberish the savages hereabout\r\nspeak.\"\r\n\r\n\"No such gibberish, and no such savages either,\" said the little\r\nkeen-eyed man. \"_Moi, je suis de Landes_; and the Landes language is a\r\nfar finer language than French. French! phoo, phoo!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he took a pinch of snuff indignantly and triumphantly. The Bordeaux\r\ngentleman winked blandly at me, as if the keen-eyed man was a character\r\nto be humoured, and then looked doubtful and unconvinced.\r\n\r\n\"Tohua-Cohoa,\" he said; \"it has a _sacré tonnerre_ of a barbarous sound;\r\nhas it any meaning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning!\" exclaimed the man of the Landes; \"I should think so.\r\nTohua-Cohoa means, in French, _Allez doucement_; and the place was so\r\ncalled because there was there a dangerous swamp, in which many a\r\ndonkey coming up from Teste with fish to you of Bordeaux was smothered;\r\nand so it got to be quite proverbial among the drivers of the donkeys,\r\nand they used to shout to each other, 'Tohua-Cohoa!' whenever they came\r\nnear the slough; meaning to look out, and go gently, and take care of\r\nthe soft places.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the blouse, who was clearly the champion of the Landes,\r\nthen turned indignantly from the Bordeaux man and addressed himself to\r\nme. \"The language which the poor people here speak, monsieur, is a fine\r\nand expressive language, and liker the Spanish than the French. The\r\npeople are poor, and very ignorant. They believe, monsieur, in ghosts,\r\nand witches, and sorceries, just as all France did two or three hundred\r\nyears ago. Very few of them can read, monsieur, and they have bad food\r\nand no wine. But nevertheless, monsieur, they are _bons enfants--braves\r\ngens_, monsieur. They love their pine-woods and their sands as much as\r\nother people do their corn-fields and their vines, monsieur. They would\r\ndie, monsieur, if you took them away from the sand and the trees. They\r\nare not like the Auvergnats, who go in troops to Paris to carry water\r\nfrom the fountains, and who are _betes--betes--bien betes_! They stay at\r\nhome, monsieur. They wear their sheep-skins and walk upon their stilts,\r\nlike their forefathers before them, monsieur; and if you are coming here\r\nto see the Landes, and if you lose yourself in the woods, and see a\r\nlight glimmering through the trees, and rap at the cottage door,\r\nmonsieur, you will be welcomed, monsieur, and have the best they can\r\noffer to eat, and the softest they can offer to sleep on. _Tenez, tenez;\r\nnous sommes pauvres et ignorants mais nous sommes, loyals et bons!_\"\r\n\r\nThe tears fairly stood in the keen black eyes of the Landes man as he\r\nconcluded his harangue, of which I have only reported the main points;\r\nfor, truth to tell, the poor fellow's vehemence was so great, and his\r\nutterance so rapid, that I lost nearly as much as I caught. The Bordeaux\r\ngentleman hammered the floor with his umbrella in satirical approbation,\r\nthe rest of the passengers looked curiously on, and, the engine\r\nwhistling, we pulled up again at a station similar to the first--a\r\nshed--a clearing, and black pine all around. There were just three\r\npersons on the rough platform--the station-master in a blouse, and two\r\nyellow-breeched _gens-d'armes_. What could they find to occupy them\r\namong these drear pine-woods? What thief, who had not made a vow of\r\nvoluntary starvation, or who had not a morbid taste for living upon\r\nresin, would ever have ventured among them? But the authorities! Catch a\r\nbit of France without an \"authority!\" As they certainly are omnipotent,\r\nand profess to be omniscient, it is only to be supposed that they should\r\nbe omnipresent. One man left the train at the station in question--a\r\nslouching, stupid, swarthy peasant, the authorities pounced upon him,\r\nevidently in prodigious glee at catching somebody to be _autoritised_\r\nover, and we left them, spelling and squabbling over the greasy-looking\r\n\"papers\" presented by the profoundly respectful Jacques or Pierre.\r\n\r\nAnd now, before proceeding further, I may be allowed to describe, with\r\nsome minuteness, the landscape which will greet the traveller in the\r\nLandes. Its mere surface-aspect I have already sketched; but general\r\nterms go but a small way towards indicating the dreary grandeurs of that\r\nsolemn wilderness. Over all its gloom and barrenness--over all its\r\n\"blasted heaths\" and monotonous pine-woods, and sodden morasses, and\r\nglaring heaps of shifting sand--there is a strong and pervading sense of\r\nloneliness, a grandeur and intensity of desolation, which, as it were,\r\nclothes the land with a sad, solemn poetry peculiar to itself. Emerging\r\nfrom black forests of fir, the wanderer may find himself upon a plain,\r\nflat as a billiard-table, and apparently boundless as the ocean, clad in\r\none unvaried, unbroken robe of dusky heath. Sometimes stripes and\r\nridges, or great ragged patches of sand, glisten in the fervid sunshine;\r\nsometimes belts of scraggy young fir-trees appear rising from the\r\nhorizon on the left, and fading into the horizon on the right.\r\nOccasionally a brighter shade of green, with jungles of willows and\r\ncoarse water-weeds, giant rushes, and marish-mosses, and tangled masses\r\nof dank vegetation, will tell of the unfathomable swamp beneath. Dark\r\nveins of muddy water will traverse the flat oozy land, sometimes,\r\nperhaps, losing themselves in broad shallow lakes, bordered again by the\r\nendless sand-banks and stretches of shadowy pine. The dwellings which\r\ndot this dreary, yet, in its way, solemnly poetic landscape, are\r\ngenerally mere isolated huts, separated sometimes by many miles, often\r\nby many leagues. Round them the wanderer will descry a miserable field\r\nor two, planted with a stunted crop of rye, millet, or maize. The\r\ncottages are mouldering heaps of sod and unhewn and unmortared stones,\r\nclustered round with ragged sheds composed of masses of tangled bushes,\r\npine stakes, and broadleaved reeds, beneath which cluster, when not\r\nseeking their miserable forage in the woods, two or three cows, mere\r\nskin and bone, and a score or two of the most abject-looking sheep which\r\never browsed.\r\n\r\nProceeding through the Landes towards the coast, a long chain of lakes\r\nand water-courses, running parallel to the ocean, breaks their\r\nuniformity. The country becomes a waste of shallow pools, and of land\r\nwhich is parched in summer and submerged in winter. Running in devious\r\narms and windings through moss and moor and pine, these \"lakes of the\r\ndismal swamp\" form labyrinths of gulfs and morasses which only the most\r\nexperienced shepherds can safely thread. Here and there a village, or\r\nrather bourg, will be seen upon their banks, half hidden in the\r\npine-woods; and a roughly-built fishing-punt or two will be observed\r\nfloating like the canoe of a savage in the woodland lakes. Sometimes, as\r\nin the case of the basin of Arcachon, which will be presently described,\r\nthese waters are arms of the sea; and the retreating tide leaves scores\r\nof square miles of putrid swamp. Sometimes they are mere collections of\r\nsurface-drainage, accumulating without any means of escape to the ocean,\r\nand perilous in the extreme to the dwellers on their shores. For,\r\nforming the extreme line of coast, there runs, for near two hundred\r\nmiles, from the Adour to the Garonne, a range of vast hills of white\r\nsand, as fine as though it had been sifted for an hour-glass. Every gale\r\nchanges the shape of these rolling mountains. A strong wind from the\r\nland flings millions of tons of sand per hour into the sea, to be washed\r\nup again by the surf, flung on the beach, and in the first Biscay gale\r\nblown in whirlwinds inland. A winter hurricane again from the west has\r\nfilled up with sand square miles of shallow lake, driving the displaced\r\nwaters inland, dispersing them in gleaming lakes among the pine-woods,\r\nflooding, and frequently destroying the scattered hamlets of the people,\r\nand burying for ever their fields of millet and rye. I shall presently\r\nhave occasion to touch upon some disasters of this sort. Meantime,\r\nhaving made the aspect of the Landes familiar to the reader, I pursue\r\nthe thread of my journey.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of a population upon stilts--men, women, and children,\r\nspurning the ground, and living habitually four or five feet higher than\r\nthe rest of mankind--irresistibly takes the imagination, and I leant\r\nanxiously from the carriage to catch the first glimpse of a Landean in\r\nhis native style. I looked long in vain. We passed hut after hut, but\r\nthey seemed deserted, except that the lean swine burrowing round the\r\nturf walls gave evidence that the pork had proprietors somewhere. At\r\nlast I was gratified; as the train passed not very quickly along a\r\njungle of bushes and coppice-wood, a black, shaggy figure rose above it,\r\nas if he were standing upon the ends of the twigs. The effect was quite\r\neldritch. We saw him but as a vision, but the high conical hat with\r\nbroad brims, like Mother Red-cap's, the swarthy, bearded face, and the\r\nrough, dirty sheep-skin, which hung fleecily from the shoulders of the\r\napparition, haunted me. He was come and gone, and that was all.\r\nPresently, however, the natives began to heave in sight in sufficient\r\nprofusion. There were three gigantic-looking figures stalking together\r\nacross an expanse of dusky heath. I thought them men, and rather tall\r\nones; but my companions, more accustomed to the sight, said they were\r\nboys on comparatively short stilts, herding the sheep, which were\r\nscattered like little greyish stones all over the waste. Anon, near a\r\ncottage, we saw a woman, in dark, coarse clothes, with shortish\r\npetticoats, sauntering almost four feet from the ground, and next beheld\r\nat a distance, and on the summit of a sand-ridge, relieved against the\r\nsky, three figures, each leaning back, and supported, as it seemed, not\r\nonly by two daddy long-legs' limbs, but by a third, which appeared to\r\ngrow out of the small of their backs. The phenomenon was promptly\r\nexplained by my bloused _cicerone_, who seemed to feel especial pleasure\r\nat my interest in the matter. The third leg was a pole or staff the\r\npeople carry, with a new moon-shaped crutch at the top, which, applied\r\nto the back, serves as a capital prop. With his legs spread out, and his\r\nback-stay firmly pitched, the shepherd of the Landes feels as much at\r\nhome as you would in the easiest of easy chairs.\r\n\r\n\"He will remain so for hours, without stirring, and without being\r\nwearied,\" said my fellow-passenger. \"It is a way of sitting down in the\r\nLandes. Why, a shepherd, could stand so, long enough to knit a pair of\r\nstockings, ay, and not have an ache in his back. Sometimes they play\r\ncards, so, without once coming off their stilts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, and cheat! _Mon Dieu!_ how they cheat!\" said the Bordeaux\r\ngentleman. The native of the Landes reluctantly admitted that was\r\nthe truth, and the other went on:--\r\n\r\n\"These fellows here on the stilts are the most confounded gamblers in\r\nEurope. Men and women, it's all the same--play, play, play; they would\r\nstake their bodies first, and their souls after. _Tenez_; I once heard\r\nof a lot of the fellows playing in a wood till they were all but\r\nstarved. In the day they played by daylight, and when night came, they\r\nkindled a bonfire and played in the glare. They played on and on, in\r\nspite of hunger and thirst. They staked their money--not that they had\r\nmuch of that--and their crops--not that they were of great value\r\neither--and their pigs, and their sheep, and their Landes ponies, and\r\nthen their furniture, and then their clothes, and, last of all, their\r\nstilts--for a Landes man thinks his stilts the principal part of his\r\nwardrobe; and, _sacré!_ monsieur, three of the fellows were ruined out\r\nand out, and had to give up their hats, and sheep-skins, and sabots,\r\nwhile the man who was the greatest winner walked home on his own stilts,\r\nwith the stilts of all his comrades tucked under his arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gaming is their fault--their great fault,\" meekly acknowledged the\r\nblouse.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all!\" said his antagonist. \"Cheating is their great fault. A\r\nLandes shepherd would cheat the devil with a greasy pack of cards.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" replied the apologist, \"that they count cheating part of\r\nthe game. Their motto is, win anyhow; so it is no worse for one than the\r\nother. Cards is chance; but cheating needs skill, and _voila tout_.\"\r\n\r\nWe were fast approaching Teste, and had passed two or three clusters of\r\npoor huts, and a party of women up to their waists in a sluggish stream\r\nwashing fleeces, while yellow patches of ripening maize began to recur\r\nquicker and quicker, showing that we had reached a comparatively\r\nthickly-peopled district, when all at once there burst upon my eyes a\r\nglorious-looking prairie of gently undulating land, of the brightest\r\ngreen I ever looked upon. The green of the greenest lawns of England,\r\nthe green of the softest bogs of Ireland, the green even of the most\r\nintensely green patches of the Curragh of Kildare, were brown, and\r\nfuzzy, and rusty, compared to this wonderful hue. The land looked like\r\none huge emerald, sparkling in the sun. The brightness, the freshness,\r\nthe radiance of the tint, was almost supernatural, and the eye, nursed\r\nfor it, as it were, after our journey over the brown moors and black\r\npines, caught the bright fresh beauty of the colour with rapture.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" I thought, \"there are, at least, oases in the Landes. Never was\r\nturf so glorious; never was sward so bewitching.\" And then, gazing far\r\nand wide upon the prairie, I saw it dotted with human figures labouring\r\nat the soil, and great wains and carts drawn by oxen, looking like black\r\nspecks upon a great, fresh, green leaf. But, in a moment, I saw\r\nsomething more. Could I believe my eyes? A ship! Yes, verily, a ship,\r\nfast aground, high and dry upon the turf! and not only one, but two,\r\nthree, four, good-sized schooners and _chasse marées_, with peasants\r\ndigging about them, and country carts high heaped with green\r\nrural-looking burdens.\r\n\r\nThe Landes man saw my bewilderment. \"The green-looking land,\" he said,\r\n\"is the flat bottom of part of the bay of Arcachon. It is now dead\r\nlow-water, and the country people have come down with their carts to\r\nfill them with that green slimy seaweed, which makes capital manure; and\r\nsome of them, perhaps, have brought casks of resin for those ships which\r\nprincipally belong to Bordeaux, Rochelle, and Nantes, and come here and\r\ninto other bays along the coast for the harvest of the Landes.\"\r\n\r\nThe engine whistled. We were at Teste--a shabby, ancient little village,\r\nwith a deep stream flowing sluggishly around it, and dividing itself\r\ninto a many-forked delta along the level sand; fishermen's hovels\r\nscattered on the beach, brown boats drawn up beneath them, nets drying,\r\na considerable fishy smell pervading the atmosphere, with, beyond again,\r\nthe black, unvarying mantle of pine-woods. There is a very good hotel at\r\nTeste; thanks to its being one of the Bordeaux watering-places; and\r\nthere, for dinner, was provided red mullets, which would have made the\r\nred mullet-loving Duke of Devonshire crazy, as he noted the difference\r\nbetween the fish from the bay of Arcachon and their brethren from the\r\ncoast of Weymouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE LANDES--THE BAY OF ARCACHON AND ITS FISHERS--THE LEGEND OF\r\nCHATEL-MORANT--THE PINE-WOODS--THE RESIN-GATHERER--THE WILD\r\nHORSES--THE SURF OF THE BAY OF BISCAY--THE WITCHES OF THE\r\nLANDES--POPULAR BELIEFS, AND POPULAR CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was low in the heavens next morning when I was afoot and down to\r\nthe beach, the glorious bay now brimming full, and the schooners and\r\n_chasse marées_, like the swan on St. Mary's Loch, floating double,\r\nships and shadows. The scene was very strange. The green meadow had\r\ndisappeared, and where it had been, a gleaming lake stretched brilliant\r\nin the sunshine, set in the pine-woods like a mirror in an ebony frame,\r\ncutting slices of sweeping bay out of their dusky margins, and piercing\r\ntheir depths with silent, weedy water-veins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhere the villages lie, there have been clearings made in the wood,\r\nprecisely as one would expect to see in a New Zealand or Australian bay.\r\nClose to high-water mark, rows of rounded huts serve as storehouses for\r\nnets, and spars, and sails. Before them straggling jetties run on piles\r\nfar to seaward; behind, huddled amid scanty vineyards and patches of\r\nbroadleaved Indian corn, groups of houses--their roofs nearly flat, and\r\ntheir walls not above six feet, in some places not four feet, high--seem\r\ncowering away from observation. For every cottage built of stone, there\r\nare half-a-dozen out-houses, sheds, pig-sties, and so forth, piled up\r\nwith old oars, broken masts, furze, pine-cuttings, and Irish-looking\r\nsod. I made my way to what seemed the principal landing-place--a\r\nbleached jetty. A dozen or so of boats floated round it, roughly built,\r\nvery narrow, and very light, lying upon the very top of the water, and\r\njust, in fact, as like canoes as the scene about resembled some still\r\nsavage country. Three boats were starting for the oyster fishery, manned\r\neach by four as buxom, blithe, and debonnaire wenches as you would wish\r\nto see. They had short petticoats--your Nereides of all shores have--and\r\nstraw hats, shaped like a man's. In the stern-sheets of each boat a\r\nvenerable, ancient mariner held the tiller; and as I approached, the\r\ndamsels, who were getting their clumsy oars inserted between the\r\nthole-pins, clamoured out in a torrent of vociferous gabble, offering me\r\na day's oyster-fishing, if I would go with them. They were evidently\r\nquite _au fait_ to ridding the Bordeaux loungers of their spare francs,\r\nin the shape of passage-money, for a frolic on the oyster-banks; but I\r\nhad determined to pass the day in another fashion. I wanted a sail on\r\nthe bright, still bay, a walk in the pine-woods, and a glance at the\r\nsurf tumbling in from the Bay of Biscay; so I scrutinized the faces of\r\ntwo or three lounging boatmen, with as much reference to Lavater's\r\nprinciples as I might, and selecting the most intelligent-looking of the\r\nlot--a mild, grey-eyed man, who spoke gently and slowly--we soon made a\r\nbargain, and were speedily afloat in the bean-cod looking canoe of which\r\nhe was the skipper. I was gazing doubtfully at the heavy oars, and the\r\nexpanse of water, when a flying cat's-paw made just a pretence of\r\nruffling it.\r\n\r\n\"_Merci, le bon vent!_\" said the fisherman. Up went a mast; up went a\r\nlight patch of thin white canvass, and straightway the bubbles flew fast\r\nand faster by the gunwale, and there arose a sweet gurgle from the\r\ncleaving bow.\r\n\r\n\"You can see how fast we're going by the bottom,\" said the boatman. I\r\nleant over the gunwale, and looked down. Oh, the marvellous brightness\r\nof that shining sea! I gazed from the boat upon the sand through the\r\nwater, almost as you might through the air upon the earth from a\r\nballoon. Ghost-like fish gleamed in the depths, and their shadows\r\nfollowed them below upon the ribbed sea-sand. Long flowing weeds, like\r\nrich green ribbons, waved and streamed in the gently running tidal\r\ncurrent. You could see the white pebbles and shells--here a ridge of\r\nrocks, there a dark bed of seaweed; and now and then a great flat-fish,\r\nfor all the world like a burnished pot-lid set in motion--went gleaming\r\nalong the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Once,\" said the boatman, \"all the bottom of this great bay that you are\r\nlooking at was dry land, and there were cottages upon it, and an ancient\r\nchateau. That was the chateau of Armand de Chatel-morant, an old baron\r\nof these parts, a wicked man and a great magician, who had a familiar\r\nspirit, which came when he blew a horn, and who was able, by his\r\nsorceries, to rule the winds that blow. Only, once he raised a storm he\r\ncould not quell; and it was that storm which made the Bay of Arcachon;\r\nfor the wind blew the sand of the sea-shore up the country, like a\r\nsnow-storm, and the sand-hills rolled before it; and what the wind\r\nbegan, the _coup de mer_ finished, and the ocean came bursting through\r\nthe breach it had battered in the sand-ridges of the coast, and\r\nswallowed up the chateau and drowned the magician, and there was an end\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"so be it; he deserved his fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"For many a year after the flood the baron had made,\" the boatman\r\ncontinued, \"you could see, out of a boat, the pointed tops of the towers\r\nof the chateau below you, with the weather-cocks still pointing to the\r\nwest, and the green seaweed hanging to them, like pennons from a ship's\r\nvanes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I fear it is not to be seen now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no. Ages and ages ago it rotted and rotted away; but the old men of\r\nthe village have heard from their fathers that the fishermen only\r\nventured there in calm summer weather and in good daylight; for, in the\r\ndark, look you, and when a Biscay wind was blowing, they said they heard\r\nthe sounding of Chatel-morant's magic horn, and they saw his imp flying\r\nabove them and wailing like a hurt seabird.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, I was on thorns to hear all the story; and so my boatman\r\nrecounted a rude, disjointed tale, which I have hitched, legendwise,\r\ninto the following narrative:--\r\n\r\nThe Baron Armand de Chatel-morant sat in his dim studio high up in the\r\nmost seaward tower of the chateau of Chatel-morant. His hair and his\r\nbeard were white, but his eyes were keen, and his cheeks as ruddy as the\r\neyes and the cheeks of a young man. He had a furnace beside him, with\r\nimplements of projection, crucibles, and powders. On the table were\r\nastrological instruments, and the magic crystal, which his Familiar had\r\ngiven him, and in which--only, however, when the Familiar pleased--the\r\nbaron could read the future; but, for every reading of the future, the\r\nbaron was a year older--the Familiar had a year of his life. The baron\r\nwas clothed in a long furred robe, and he wore red shoes, with peaked\r\ntoes, as long again as his feet. His face was moody, and clouds went\r\ndriving along his brow. He took up his instruments, and laid them down,\r\nand opened a big book, full of spells and cantrips, and shut it; then he\r\nwalked about the room; and then he stopped and blew a silver whistle.\r\n\r\nVery prompt at the sound came an old man--reverent and sorrowful\r\nlooking--with a white wand; for he was the seneschal of the chateau of\r\nChatel-morant.\r\n\r\n\"Your niece,\" said the baron, \"who comes hither from the town of\r\nBordeaux to visit you, and whom I saw but yester even,--has she\r\nreturned?\"\r\n\r\n\"She went this morning, monseigneur,\" said the seneschal; \"she has\r\npreparations to make; for, God save the pretty child! she is to be\r\nmarried on the day of Blessed St. John.\"\r\n\r\nThe baron frowned; for he was not an admirer of the saints, being quite,\r\nindeed, on the other side of the hedge.\r\n\r\n\"Say the number of the day, and the name of the month,\" he replied,\r\nangrily; \"and do not torment me with that shaveling jargon which they\r\ntalk in the monastery of Andrew, whom they call St. Andrew at Bordeaux.\"\r\n\r\nThe seneschal, who was accustomed to be bullied, particularly upon\r\nreligious subjects, crossed himself behind his back; for he was a\r\nprudent man, and, owing to the absence of mind of the baron, who was\r\nalways experimentalizing in the black art, managed, one way or other, to\r\npick up so much as to make his place a tolerably profitable one.\r\n\r\n\"Married!\" said the baron; \"and to whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just to honest and brave Jacques Fort--the stoutest mariner who sails\r\nout of the Garonne. He has got a ship of his own, now--the _Sainte\r\nVierge_; and to-day he sails upon his first voyage, as far as Bayonne.\"\r\n\r\n\"He sails to-day--so; and the maiden's name--your niece's name--what is\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Toinette, so please you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may go.\"\r\n\r\nAnd go the seneschal did, wondering very much at the uncommon interest\r\nhis master seemed to be taking in vulgar, sublunary things.\r\n\r\nThen Baron Armand de Chatel-morant paced the room a long time in gloomy\r\nmeditation. At length he sat down again, and said aloud: \"There is no\r\ndoubt of it--I am in love. That face haunts me; Toinette's face is ever\r\nfloating opposite to me. 'Tis an odd feeling; I was never so before.\r\nBut, since it is so, I must even have the maiden--she will cheer me--I\r\nlove her face. I will send to-morrow to Bordeaux, as from her uncle; and\r\nwhen she comes here, by the star of Aldeboran, she stays here, Jacques\r\nFort to the contrary notwithstanding!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wrong--quite wrong!\" said a voice.\r\n\r\nThe baron turned coolly round, and saw, sitting upon the arm of the\r\nchair close to him, the figure of a very thin dwarf, with a long,\r\nunearthly face, and fingers like hawks' claws. This was the imp--the\r\nbaron's Familiar.\r\n\r\n\"How, Klosso!\" said Armand; \"you come without being called?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but you would have called me soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what I am thinking of--of Toinette. I love her--I must have\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not have her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is so decreed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Klosso,\" said the baron, \"I don't believe you. You know the future;\r\nbut you lie about it when you speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you, then,\" answered the demon, \"look into the crystal: that can't\r\nlie. Come--it's only another year--give yourself a treat--come!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given you many years already,\" said the baron, musing; \"look how\r\ngrey my hair is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dye it,\" said the imp, who, if he was a Familiar, certainly behaved as\r\nsuch. But the baron took no notice of his impertinence. He was\r\ndreadfully smitten by Toinette, and said he'd have a twelvemonths' worth\r\nof knowledge of futurity for her sake. The thin dwarf grinned, and then\r\nmade a motion of relief, as one who saw before him the speedy end of a\r\nlong, long watch. So he took the crystal, uttered, as may be supposed,\r\nsome magic words; and the baron looked upon the clear surface.\r\n\r\n\"Malediction!\" he exclaimed, as he saw in the crystal a huge hearth,\r\nwith pots on the fire, and poultry roasting before it, and Toinette\r\ntending the cookery, and a stalwart fellow helping her clumsily.\r\n\r\n\"That is Toinette!\" cried the baron; \"but who is the rascal with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her husband, Jacques Fort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curses on him!\"\r\n\r\nHere the baron saw Jacques fling his arm round Toinette's waist, and\r\nkiss her so naturally, that he ground his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Domestic felicity,\" said the imp; \"a charming picture, baron--they're\r\ncooking the christening feast for young Jacques.\"\r\n\r\nThe baron flung the crystal down.\r\n\r\n\"Pay me,\" said the imp; and he passed the bird-like hand over the\r\nbaron's face, and each of his fingers drew a wrinkle. A shudder went\r\nover the sorcerer's frame, and then he breathed heavily, and looked\r\nwistfully at the imp. He was a year older.\r\n\r\n\"Klosso!\" shouted Armand, leaping to his feet, \"I will fight fate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Better not,\" said Klosso.\r\n\r\n\"Curse the future!\" exclaimed the baron; \"I will alter the future, and\r\ngive the lie to the crystal, as to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you try,\" replied the imp, coolly, \"you will belong to me before the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, slave!\" cried Armand, who was not a man to be put out of his\r\nway; \"you rule the winds--I rule you. Make the west wind blow.\"\r\n\r\nThe imp raised its hand, and they heard the whistling of a strong, gusty\r\nwind, and the creaking of the weather-cocks, as they all turned towards\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n\"Stronger--stronger--stronger!\" shouted the baron; and the whistle\r\nbecame a roar, and the roar a howl; and the castle shook and swayed in\r\nthe blast.\r\n\r\n\"Good--good!\" laughed the baron; \"something more than a puff there--ha!\r\nha!--as Jacques Fort has found by this time on the deck of his new ship\r\nin the Bay of Biscay.\"\r\n\r\nThe Familiar gently remarked that the weather was roughish, when the\r\nseneschal rushed into the room in a dreadful state of terror at the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\"My lord--my lord!\" he said, \"we shall all be blown away; the air is\r\nfull of sand; you would be suffocated outside. The wind is tearing up\r\nthe pines; and oh, poor Jacques Fort is at sea, and drowned--drowned, by\r\nthis time, to a certainty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Armand, \"I should rather think so. Toinette must take up\r\nwith somebody else.--Stronger!\"\r\n\r\nThe last injunction was addressed to the imp, and instantly complied\r\nwith. The tempest roared like the up-bursting of a volcano, and\r\nscreeched and screamed through the sugar-loaf turrets and the lattices,\r\nwhich it had burst in, and the loop-holes, like a hundred thousand\r\ndevils' whistles. The seneschal fell on his knees.\r\n\r\n\"Stronger still!\" said the baron.\r\n\r\nAnd meantime what was Jaques Fort doing in his new ship? With every rag\r\nof canvass torn out of the bolt-ropes, the _Sainte Vierge_ was flying on\r\nthe very top, as it seemed, of the driving spray, on to the breakers.\r\nJacques was the only man left on deck--every one of the rest had been\r\nwashed overboard, and were already sleeping in the sea; and he knew that\r\nin a moment he would follow them. The staggering ship rose on the back\r\nof a mighty breaker; and the captain knew that with its fall upon the\r\nbeach his vessel would be ground to powder.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Toinette!\" he murmured, as the ship was hove forward like a bolt\r\nfrom a bow, and then fell shooting into a creaming current of rushing\r\nwater, while the sand-hills appeared right and left for a moment, and\r\nthen were left astern. The last grand wave had burst the barrier, and\r\nthe frail ship and the kneeling mariner were borne onward on the ridge\r\nof the advancing flood, which formed the lake of Arcachon. Jacques Fort\r\nsaw a light, and steered towards it: it was the light in the baron's\r\nchamber at the chateau of Chatel-morant.\r\n\r\nThere, by the burst-in lattice, stood the baron, his grey hair flying\r\nabove his head, and ever shouting to the imp, \"Stronger,\r\nKlosso--stronger!\" And every time he used the words, the hurricane burst\r\nlouder and louder upon the rocking turrets. And still Armand clung to\r\nthe stone-work of the burst-in lattice, through which the flying sand\r\ndrove in, and clustered in his robes and hair.\r\n\r\nAnd now the terrified domestics began to rush up to the chamber of the\r\nbaron.\r\n\r\n\"My lord, such a storm was never heard of!\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, the devil is loose, and riding on the wind!\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, the end of the world is at hand!\"\r\n\r\n\"Klosso!\" shouted the baron, \"stronger!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the wind burst like a thunder-clap over them, and they\r\nheard the crash of a falling tower. The serving men and women grovelled\r\nin terror on the floor; the baron clung by the window; the imp, visible\r\nonly to him, sat on the back of the arm-chair, as he had sat since his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nBut hush! Another sound, mingling with the roar of the wind, and deeper\r\nand more awful still. It rapidly increased, and the baron found his face\r\nbesprinkled with driving drops of water--they were salt.\r\n\r\n\"My lord--my lord!\" screamed the seneschal, sinking, as he spoke, at\r\nthe baron's knees; \"my lord--the sea!\"\r\n\r\nA cry was heard without; the lights of the hamlet beneath disappeared;\r\nand then a shock from below made the chateau swing and rock, and white\r\nwaves were all around them.\r\n\r\n\"The sea, my lord,\" said the seneschal, \"has burst the sand-banks; the\r\ncastle stands on low ground. We are all dead men--the sea--the sea!\"\r\n\r\nThe Baron Armand turned to Klosso: \"Does he speak truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"The worthy gentleman,\" said the imp, \"is perfectly in the right; you\r\nare all dead men; and, Monseigneur le Baron, when you gave me last a\r\nyear of your life, you gave me the last you had to give.\"\r\n\r\nUp rose the water, and higher dashed the waves. Up, foot by foot, and\r\nyard by yard; and still the baron stood erect amid the raving of the\r\nelements--his face as white as his hair, but his eyes as bright and keen\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\n\"Klosso,\" he said, \"I am yours; and the future is the future.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the iron lamp swinging above his head.\r\n\r\n\"It will soon be out,\" said Klosso.\r\n\r\nJacques Fort still steered to the light. It came nearer and nearer; and\r\nhe saw, even through the gloom and the driving spray, that it shone from\r\na castle-turret, and he seized the tiller to change the course of the\r\nvessel; but as he did so, the grand, triumphant, finishing blast of the\r\nhurricane fell upon the seething flood like iron--heaved up one\r\nbristling, foaming sea, which caught the _Sainte Vierge_ upon its\r\ncrest, and flung the ship almost into the air. The light gleamed for a\r\nmoment almost beneath him; and Jacques, rushing to the bow, saw below\r\nit, as in a prison, a fierce convulsed face, and staring eyes, and\r\nflying white hair; and the eyes saw him. As Jacques recognised the\r\nsorcerer Armand of Chatel-morant, so did Armand recognise the face and\r\nform he had seen helping Toinette to cook the christening feast.\r\n\r\nThe next instant the _Sainte Vierge_ was borne over and over the highest\r\nturret of the chateau, her keel a fathom good above the loftiest and the\r\ngaudiest of all the gilt weather-cocks.\r\n\r\nThe event foreshadowed in the crystal duly took place on the anniversary\r\nof the day which saw the chateau de Chatel-morant swallowed in the Bay\r\nof Arcachon.\r\n\r\nThe legend of the submerged chateau, with which I plead guilty to having\r\ntaken a few liberties, but \"only with a view\" (as the magistrate said\r\nwhen he put his neighbour into the stocks)--\"only with a view towards\r\nimprovement,\" occupied us during the greater part of our smooth and\r\npleasant sail. Dismissing matters legendary, we talked of the fishermen\r\nof the bay, and their neighbours, the shepherds on stilts. The man of\r\nthe sea held the men of the land cheap. The peasants were never out of\r\nthe forests and the sand, he said; the fishermen often went to Bordeaux,\r\nand sometimes to Rochelle, and sometimes even to Nantes. They (the\r\nboatmen) never used stilts; but as soon as the peasant's children were\r\nable to toddle, they were clapped upon a pair of sticks, and many a\r\ntumble, and many a broken face they caught, before they could use them\r\neasily. \"They are a good set of people, but very ignorant, and they\r\nbelieve whatever you tell them. They are frightened out of their wits if\r\nyou speak of witches or sorcerers; but we know that all these old tales\r\nare nothing but nonsense. We go to Bordeaux very often as pilots, and to\r\nRochelle, and even to Nantes.\" I was further informed, that in the\r\nwinter time the fishermen pursued their occupation in the bay in such\r\nboats as that in which I was sailing; and that in summer they went out\r\ninto the Atlantic; but never ventured more than a few miles to sea, and\r\nnever, if they could help it, stayed out a night.\r\n\r\nThis kind of conversation brought us tolerably well to the narrow\r\npassage, all fenced with intricate sand-banks, which leads to the open\r\nsea. A white, graceful lighthouse rose above the sand-banks on our\r\nright, into which the pine-woods were stretching in long, finger-like\r\nprojections; and the boat, beginning to rise and fall upon the slow,\r\nmajestic heave which the swell without communicated to the shallow water\r\nwithin the bar, assured me that if we went further, the surf would\r\nprevent our landing at all. We ran the boat upon the beach, and drawing\r\nher up high and dry, plunged into, not the greenwood, but the black-wood\r\ntree. It was hard walking. The pines grew out of fine bright sand, bound\r\nhere and there together by carpets of long bent grass, and the air was\r\nsickly with the peculiar resinous smell of the rich sap of the tree\r\nfermenting and distilling down the gashes. In our ramble, we encountered\r\ntwo of the peasants, whose dreary work it is to hack the pines and\r\nladle up the flowing proceeds. We heard the blows of the axe echoing in\r\nthe hot silence of the mid-day, and made our way to whence the sound\r\nproceeded, speedily descrying the workman, perched upon a slight bending\r\nladder, gashing the tree. This man, and, indeed, all his brethren whom I\r\nsaw, were miserable-looking creatures--their features sunken and\r\nanimal-like--their hair matted in masses over their brows--their feet\r\nbare, and their clothing painfully wretched. Their calling is as\r\nlaborious as it is monotonous. Starting with the dawn, they plunge--a\r\nladder in one hand, and an adze in the other--into the recesses of the\r\npine-wood, repeating the same process to every tree. The ladder in\r\nquestion is very peculiar, consisting of a single strip of elastic wood,\r\nabout ten feet long, dotted with knobs cut plain upon one side for the\r\nfoot to rest upon, and thus serving instead of rounds or steps. This\r\nprimitive ladder is sliced away towards the top, so as to rest more\r\ncommodiously upon the tree. When in use, it is placed almost\r\nperpendicularly, and the workman ascends it like a monkey, never\r\ntouching the tree, but keeping the ladder in its position by the action\r\nof his legs, which, from the knee downward, seem to cling round and\r\nround the bending wood, and keep it in its place, even when the top,\r\nlaid perhaps against the rounded side of the trunk, appears to be\r\nslipping off every moment.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said my guide, the Teste boatman, \"I would rather reef topsails\r\nin a gale of wind than go up there, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladder, its proprietor told me, could not be used except with naked\r\nfeet. The instrument with which he cut the tree was as sharp as a razor,\r\nand required long practice to acquire the knack of using it. I wondered\r\nthat the gashing did not kill the trees, as some of the largest were\r\nmarked with half-a-dozen cuts from the ground to the fork. Here and\r\nthere, indeed, you found one which had succumbed to the process, rotted,\r\nand fallen; but the majority seemed in very good case, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that tree,\" said a resin-gatherer. More than half the bark had\r\ncertainly gone in these perpendicular stripes, and yet it looked strong\r\nand stately \"That tree is more than a hundred years old; and that is not\r\na bad age for either a man or a fir.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the peasant behind, we pushed steadily towards the sea. The\r\nground, thanks to the debris of the pines, was as slippery as ice,\r\nexcept where we plunged into fine hot sand, half way to the knees. Every\r\nnow and then we crossed what I cannot describe better than by calling it\r\na perfectly bald spot in the woods--a circular patch of pure white\r\nsand--in certain lights, you might have taken it for snow. All around\r\nwere the black pines; but not a blade or a twig broke the drifted\r\nfineness of the bald white patch. You could find neither stone nor\r\nshell--nothing but subtle, powdery sand--every particle as minute and as\r\nuniform as those in an hour-glass.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said my guide, when we came in view of the first of these\r\nsingular little saharas--\"that is a devil's garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does he grow there?\" I asked. The man lowered his voice: \"It\r\nis in these spots of fine white sand that all the sorcerers and witches,\r\nand warlocks in France--ay, and I have heard, in the whole world--meet\r\nto sing, and dance, and frolic; and the devil sits in the middle. So, at\r\nleast,\" he added, after a pause, and in a more sprightly tone--\"so the\r\npeasants say.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you say it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do not know. There's witches, for certain, in the Landes,--old\r\nwomen--but whether they come flying out here to dance round the devil or\r\nno--the peasants say so for certain--but I don't think I believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope you didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"They enchant people, though; there's no doubt of that. They can give\r\nyou the fever so bad that no doctor can set you to rights again; and\r\nthey can curse a place, and keep the grass from growing on it; but I\r\ndon't believe they fly on broomsticks, or dance round the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any young women witches?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do hear of one or two. _Mais elles ne sont pas bien fortes._ It\r\nis only the old ones make good witches, and the uglier they are the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, did they ever do any harm to you?\"\r\n\r\nThe man paused, and looked at me with a puzzled expression. \"Our little\r\nMarie,\" he said, \"has fits; and my wife does say--\" Here he stopped.\r\n\"No, monsieur,\" he said, \"I do not believe in witches.\"\r\n\r\nBut he did, as firmly as King Jamie; only now and then, in the bright\r\nsunlight, and with an incredulous person, he thought he did not.\r\n\r\nOn, however, we went mile after mile, over the slippery ground, and in\r\nthe shadow of the pines, ere we saw gleaming ahead, the region of fine\r\nsand, and heard--although the little breeze which blew was off the\r\nshore--the low thunder of the \"coup de mer\"--the breaking surf of the\r\nocean. Presently, passing through a zone of stunted furze, and dry\r\nthin-bladed grass, we emerged into the most fearful desert I ever looked\r\nupon--a sea of heights and hollows, dells and ridges, long slopes and\r\nprecipitous ravines--all of them composed of pure white, hot, drifting\r\nsand. The labour of walking was excessive. I longed for the stilts I had\r\nseen the day before. Every puff of breeze sent the sand, like dry\r\npungent powder, into our faces, and sometimes we could see it reft from\r\nthe peaks of the ridges, and blown like clouds of dust far out into the\r\nair. All at once my guide touched my arm, \"_Voila! donc, voila! des\r\nchevaux sauvages!_\" It certainly only required a breed of wild horses to\r\nmake the country an exact counterpart of Arabia; and I eagerly turned to\r\nsee the steeds of the desert, just succeeding in catching a glimpse of a\r\nruck of lean, brown, shaggy ponies, disappearing round a hill, in a\r\nwhirlwind of sand. There is, undoubtedly, something romantic and\r\nMazeppaish in the notion of wild horses of the desert; but stern truth\r\ncompels me to add, that a more stunted, ragged lot of worthless brutes,\r\nnot bigger than donkeys, than were the troop of desert steeds of the\r\nLandes which I had the fortune to see, could be nowhere met with. My\r\nfisherman told me that, when caught and tamed, they were useful in\r\ncarrying sacks and panniers along the sandy ways; but that there were\r\nnot more vicious, stubborn brutes in nature than Landes ponies.\r\n\r\nA doubly fatiguing trudge, unbroken by any further episodical visions of\r\ndesert steeds, but enlivened by the fast increasing thunder of the surf,\r\nat length brought us to its foam. Winding through a succession of sand\r\nvalleys, we climbed a steepish bank, sinking to our knees at every step,\r\nand from this last ridge beheld a long, gentle slope, as perfectly\r\nsmooth as though the sand had been smoothed by a ruler--fining away down\r\nto the white creaming sheets of water which swept, with the loud\r\npeculiar hiss of the agitated sea, far up and down the level banks. The\r\nfull force of the great heaving swells was expended in breakers, roaring\r\nhalf a mile from the land; and from their uttermost verge to the tangled\r\nheaps of seaweed washed high and dry upon the beach, was a vast belt of\r\nfoaming water, extending away on either hand in a perfectly straight\r\nline as far as the eye could reach, and dividing the shipless expanse of\r\nwater from the houseless expanse of land. The scene was very solemn.\r\nThere was not even a seabird overhead--not an insect crawling or humming\r\nalong the ungrateful sand. Only the grand organ of the surf made its\r\nincessant music, and the sharp thin rustle of the moving sand came\r\nfitfully upon the ear. I sat down and listened to it, and as I sat, the\r\ncontinually shifting sand gradually rose around me, as the waters rose\r\nround the chateau of Chatel-morant. Had I stayed there long enough, only\r\nmy head would have been visible, like the head of the sphinx.\r\n\r\nI dined that day at the hotel, _tete-à-tete_ with a young priest, who\r\nwas returning to Bordeaux from a visit to his brother, one of the\r\nofficers of the Preventitive Service, whose lonely barracks are almost\r\nthe only human habitations which break the weary wilderness stretching\r\nfrom the Adour to the Gironde. One would have thought that there could\r\nbe but little smuggling on such a coast; but the Duaniers are always\r\n_autorités_, and the waves of the Gulf of Gascony could not, of course,\r\nbreak on French ground without _autorités_ to help them. With respect to\r\nthe priest, however, he had one of the finest heads and the most\r\nperfectly chiselled features I ever saw. The pale high brow--the keen\r\nbright eyes, with remarkably long eye-lashes--the tenuity of the\r\ncartilage of the nose, and the perfect delicacy of the mouth--all told\r\nof intellect in no common development; while the meek sweetness of the\r\nnoble face had something in it perfectly heavenly. Fling in imagination\r\nan aureole round that head, and you had the head of a youthful martyr,\r\nor a saint canonized for early virtues. There was devotion and\r\naspiration in every line of the countenance--a meek, mild gentleness,\r\nbeautifully in keeping with every word he uttered, and every movement he\r\nmade. I was the more struck with all this, inasmuch as there is not an\r\nuglier, meaner, nor, I will add, dirtier, set of worthy folks in all the\r\nworld, than the priests of France. Nine times out of ten, they are\r\nbig-jowled, coarse, animal-looking men, with mottled faces, and skins\r\nwhich do not take kindly to the razor. The arrangements about the neck\r\nshow a decided scarcity of linen, and a still greater lack of soap and\r\nwater. They are seldom or never gentlemen, their figures are ungainly,\r\ntheir motions uncouth, and--barring, of course, their scholastic and\r\ntheological knowledge--I found the majority with whom I conversed\r\nstupid, illiterate, and unintelligent. Now, the young priest at Teste\r\nwas the reverse of all this. With manners as polished as those of any\r\ncourtly _abbé_ of the courtly old _regime_, there was a perfect\r\natmosphere of frankness and quiet good-humour about my companion, and\r\nhis conversation was delightfully easy, animated, and graceful. I do not\r\nknow if my friend belonged to the College of Jesus; but, if he did, he\r\nwas cut out for the performance of its highest and subtlest diplomacy.\r\n\r\nWe talked of the strange part of the world I was visiting, and I found\r\nhe knew the people and the country well. I mentioned the submerged\r\nchateau and its legend, and he replied that it was an undoubted fact,\r\nthat both chateaux and villages had been overwhelmed--both by the\r\ninbursting of the sea, and by great gales blowing vast hills of sand\r\ndown into the existing lakes, and so forcing them out of their ancient\r\nbeds. The sand, indeed, he said, was more dangerous than the water.\r\nOften and often the coast-guard stations had to be dug out after a gale;\r\nand he believed that, on one occasion, a small church near the mouth of\r\nthe Gironde had been overwhelmed to such a height that only a few feet\r\nof the spire and the weathercock were left apparent. The story put me\r\nforcibly in mind of the remarkably heavy fall of snow experienced by my\r\nold friend, Baron Munchausen; but, for all that, I see no reason why it\r\nshould not be literally correct. The pines, the priest informed me, were\r\nthe saving of the country, by fixing the unstable soil, and the\r\nGovernment had engineers busily engaged in laying out plantations all\r\nalong the coast--the object being to get the trees down to high-water\r\nmark. I mentioned the superstitions of the people.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said the priest, \"What you have heard is perfectly true. We are\r\nimproving a little, perhaps. The boys and girls we get to come to school\r\nare taught to laugh at the notion of their old grandmothers being\r\nwitches, and in another generation or two there will be a great change.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do your witches work?\" I asked. \"As ours in England used to\r\ndo--by spell and charm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. They are said to make clay figures of their victims, and to\r\nstick pins in them, or bake them in a fire; and then they have rhymes\r\nand cabalistical incantations, and are greatly skilled in the magic\r\npower of herbs. The worst of it is, that a year seldom passes without an\r\noutrage on some poor old woman. A lout, who thinks himself bewitched by\r\nsuch a person, will attack her and beat her; and occasionally a bullet\r\nhas been fired at night through the cottage-window.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Landes people have, or had, other queer notions, as well as the\r\nwitch ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! They long held out against potatoes, which, they said, gave\r\nthem apoplexy, and they have only lately begun to milk their cows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so? As a pastoral people, they ought to be great in butter and\r\ncheese.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, they dislike them, and use lard or goose-grease\r\ninstead. Indeed, for centuries and centuries, they religiously believed\r\nthat Landes cows gave no milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"But was not the experiment ever tried?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scores of times. An anxious reformer would go to a Landes farmer, and\r\nurge him to milk his cows. 'Landes cows give no milk,' would be the\r\nanswer. 'Will you let me try?' would, perhaps, be replied. The Landes\r\nman would have no objection; and the cow would be brought and milked\r\nbefore him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, seeing that would convince him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you don't know the Landes people--not in the least; why, the farmer\r\nwould say, 'Ay, there are a few drops, perhaps; but it's not worth the\r\ntrouble of taking. Our fathers never milked their cows, and they were as\r\nwise as we are. And next day he would have relapsed into the old creed,\r\nthat Landes cows never gave milk at all.\"\r\n\r\nI inquired about the rate at which the stilt-walkers progressed--whether\r\nthey could, as one sometimes hears, keep up with a horse at the gallop;\r\nand found, as I expected, that six or seven miles an hour was as much as\r\nthey ever managed to achieve. The priest went on succinctly to sketch\r\nthe costume and life of the people. When in regular herding dress, the\r\nshepherd of the Landes appears one uncouth mass of dirty wool. On his\r\nbody he wears a fleece, cut in the fashion of a rude paletot, and\r\nsometimes flung over one shoulder, like a hussar's jacket. His thighs\r\nand legs are defended on the outside by cuisses and greaves of the same\r\nmaterial. On his feet he wears sabots and coarse worsted socks, covering\r\nonly the heels and the instep. His remaining clothing generally consists\r\nof frayed and tattered home-spun cloth; and altogether the appearance of\r\nthe man savours very strongly of that of a fantastically costumed\r\nscarecrow.\r\n\r\nSo attired, then, with a gourd containing some wretched _piquette_ hung\r\nacross his shoulders, and provided with a store of rye-bread, baked,\r\nperhaps, three weeks before, a few dry sardines, and as many onions or\r\ncloves of garlic, the Landes shepherd sallies forth into the wilderness.\r\nHe reckons himself a rich man, if his employer allows him, over and\r\nabove his food, sixty francs a-year. From the rising to the setting of\r\nthe sun, he never touches the ground, shuffling backwards and forwards\r\non his stilts, or leaning against a pine, plying the never-pausing\r\nknitting-needle. Sometimes he drives his flock home at eventide;\r\nsometimes he bivouacs in the wild. Unbuckling his stilts, and producing\r\nhis flint and steel, he has soon a rousing fire of fir-branches, when,\r\ngathering his sheep-skins round him, he makes himself comfortable for\r\nthe night, his only annoyances being the mosquitoes and the dread of the\r\ncantrips of some unchancy old lady, who may peradventure catch a glimpse\r\nof him in the moonlight, as she rides buxomly on her besom to a festal\r\ndance in a devil's garden.\r\n\r\n\"Yet still,\" continued the young priest, \"they are a good,\r\nhonest-hearted, open-handed people. For their wild, solitary life they\r\nhave a passionate love. The Landes peasant, taken from his dreary\r\nplains, and put down in the richest landscape of France, would pine for\r\nhis heath, and sand, and woods, like a Swiss for his hills. But they\r\nseldom leave their home here in the forests. They live and die in the\r\ndistrict where they were born, ignorant and careless of all that happens\r\nbeyond their own lonely bounds. France may vibrate with revolution and\r\nchange--the shepherds of the Landes feel no shock, take no heed, but\r\npursue the daily life of their ancestors, perfectly happy and contented\r\nin their ignorance, driving their sheep, or notching their trees in the\r\nwilderness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nUP THE GARONNE--THE OLD WARS ON ITS BANKS--ITS BOATS AND ITS\r\nSCENERY--AGEN--JASMIN, THE LAST OF THE TROUBADOURS--SOUTHERN\r\nCOOKERY AND GARLIC--THE BLACK PRINCE IN A NEW LIGHT--A DREARY\r\nPILGRIMAGE TO PAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nA solemn imprecation is on record, uttered against the memory of the man\r\nwho invented getting up by candle-light; to which some honest gentleman,\r\nfond of long lying, has appended a fellow curse, fulminated against the\r\nman who invented getting up at all. Whatever we may think of the latter\r\ncommination, I suppose we shall all agree in the propriety of the\r\nformer. At all events, no one ever execrated with more sincere good will\r\nthe memory of the ingenious originator of candle-light turnings-out than\r\nI did, when a red ray shone through the keyhole of my bedroom, and the\r\nknuckles of--one would call him boots at home--rattled at the door,\r\nwhile his hoarse voice proclaimed, \"_Trois heures et demi_,\"--a most\r\nunseasonable and absurd hour certainly; but the Agen steamer, having the\r\nstrong stream of the Garonne to face, makes the day as long as possible;\r\nand starts from the bridge--and a splendid bridge it is--of Bordeaux,\r\ncrack at half-past four. There was no help for it; and so, leaving my\r\nparting compliments for my worthy host, I soon found myself following\r\nthe truck which conveyed my small baggage, modestly stuck into the\r\ninterstices of an Alp-like pile of ricketty boxes and faded valises, the\r\nproperty of an ancient _commis voyageur_, my fellow-lodger; and pacing,\r\nfor the last time, the stately quays of the city of the Black Prince.\r\n\r\nEarly as it was, and pitch-dark, the steam-boat pier was crowded and\r\nbustling enough. Men with lanterns and luggage were rushing breathlessly\r\nabout--and gentlemen with brushy black beards were kissing each other\r\nwith true French _éffusion_--while a crowd of humble vintagers were\r\nbeing stowed away in the fore part of the boat. On the pier I observed a\r\ntent, and looking in, found myself in a genuine early breakfast shop,\r\nwhere I was soon accommodated with a seat by a pan of glowing charcoal.\r\nThe morning was bitter cold; and a magnificent bowl of smoking coffee,\r\nbread hot from the oven, and just a nip of cognac, at the kind\r\nsuggestion of the jolly motherly-looking old lady in no end of shawls,\r\nwho presided over the establishment, and who pronounced it \"_Bon pour\r\nl'estomac, du monsieur le voyageur_.\" Then aboard; and after the due\r\namount of squabbling, bell-ringing, and contradictory orders, we\r\nlaunched forth upon the black, rushing river.\r\n\r\nA dreary time it is waiting for the daylight of an autumnal morning,\r\nwatching the pale negative lighting of the east--then the spreading of\r\nthe dim approaching day--stars going out, and the outlines of hills\r\ncoming in--and houses and trees, faint and comfortless, looming amid the\r\ngrey, cold mist. The Garonne gradually turned from black to yellow--the\r\ngenuine pea-souppy hue--and bit by bit the whole landscape came clearly\r\ninto stark-staring view--but still cold and dreary-looking--until the\r\ncheering fire stood upon the hill-tops, and announced the rising sun. In\r\nhalf an hour the valley of the Garonne was a blaze of warmth and\r\ncheerfulness, and nothing could be more picturesquely beautiful, seen\r\nunder such auspices, than the fleet of market-boats through which we\r\nthreaded our way, and which were floating quietly down to Bordeaux. I\r\ndismiss the mere vegetable crafts; but the fruit-boats would have made\r\nMr. Lance leap and sing for joy. They were piled--clustered--heaped\r\nover--with mountains of grapes bigger than big gooseberries--peaches and\r\napricots, like thousands of ladies' cheeks--plums like pulpy, juicy\r\ncannon-balls--and melons big as the head of Gog or Magog. I could not\r\nunderstand how the superincumbent fruit did not crush that below; but I\r\nsuppose there is a knack in piling. At all events, the boats were loaded\r\nto the gunwales with the luscious, shiny, downy, gushing-looking\r\nglobules, purple and yellow, and both colours mellowed and softened by\r\nthe grateful green of the clustering leaves. These boats looked like\r\nfloating cornucopias. Amongst them sometimes appeared a wine-boat--one\r\nman at the head, one at the stern, and a Pyrenees of wine casks between\r\nthem--while here and there we would pass a huge Noah's ark of a barge,\r\ntowed by a string of labouring oxen, and steered from a platform\r\namidships by a tiller a great deal longer, thicker, and heavier than the\r\nmast.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a bit of the landscape. We have Gascony to our right, and\r\nGuienne to our left.\r\n\r\nHere and there, then, particularly in Guienne, the Garonne is not unlike\r\nthe tamer portions of the Rhine. The green vine-clothed banks rise into\r\nprecipitous ridges, whitened by streaks of limestone cliff, cottages\r\nnestling in the crevices and ravines, and an occasional feudal tower\r\ncrowning the topmost peak. The villages passed near the water's edge are\r\ndoleful-looking places, ruinous and death-like; whitish, crumbling\r\nhouses, with outside shutters invariably closed; empty and lonesome\r\nstreets, and dilapidated piers, the stakes worn and washed away by the\r\nconstant action of the river. Take Langon and Castres as specimens of\r\nthese places: two drearier towns--more like sepulchres than towns--never\r\nnurtured owls and bats. They seem to be still lamenting the old English\r\nrule, and longing for the jolly times when stout English barons led the\r\nGascon knights and men-at-arms on profitable forays into Limousin and\r\nAngoumais. Occasionally, however, we have a more promising and pleasing\r\nlooking town. These, for the most part, are tolerably high up the river,\r\nand possess some curious and characteristic features. You will descry\r\nthem, for instance, towering up from a mass of perpendicular cliffs; the\r\nopen-galleried and bartizaned red houses, reared upon arches and\r\npillars, rising from the rock; flights of stairs from the water's edge\r\ndisappearing among the buildings, and strips of terraced gardens laid\r\nout on the narrow shelves and ledges of the precipice.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of old feudal castles are numerous on both sides of the river;\r\nand if the red mossy stone could speak, many a tale of desperate siege\r\nand assault it could, no doubt, tell--for these strongholds were\r\nperpetually changing masters in the wars between the French and the\r\nEnglish and Gascons; and often, when peace subsisted between the crowns,\r\nwere they attacked and harried by moss-trooping expeditions led by\r\nFrench Watts Fire-the-Braes, or by English Christies of the Clinthill.\r\nWhile, then, the steamer is slowly plodding her way up stream, turning\r\nreach after reach, and showing us another and yet another pile of feudal\r\nruins, let us sit down here with Froissart beneath the awning, and try\r\nto gain some inkling into the warlike customs of the times when these\r\nthick-walled towers--no doubt built, as honest King James remarked, by\r\ngentlemen who were thieves in their hearts--alternately displayed the\r\nLion Rampant and the Fleur-de-Lis.\r\n\r\nIn all the fighting of the period--I refer generally to the age of the\r\nBlack Prince--there would appear to have been a great deal of chivalric\r\ncourtesy and forbearance shown on either side. It was but seldom that a\r\nplace was defended _à outrance_. If the besiegers appeared in very\r\nformidable force, the besieged usually submitted with a very good grace,\r\nmarched honourably out, and had their turn next time. I cannot find that\r\nthere was anything in the nature of personal animosity between the\r\ncombatants, but there was great wantonness of life; and though few men\r\nwere killed in downright cold blood, a man was frequently made the\r\nvictim of a sort of murderous frolicsomeness, the manner of his death\r\nbeing suggested, by the circumstances of the moment. For instance, on\r\none occasion, an English and Gascon garrison was besieged in\r\nAuberoche--the French having \"brought from Toulouse four large machines,\r\nwhich cast stones into the fortress night and day, which stones\r\ndemolished all the roofs of the towers, so that none within the walls\r\ndared to venture out of the vaulted rooms on the ground-floor.\" In this\r\nstrait, a \"varlet\" undertook to carry letters, requesting succour, to\r\nthe Earl of Derby, at Bordeaux. He was unsuccessful in getting through\r\nthe French lines, and being arrested, the letters were found upon him,\r\nhung round his neck, and the poor wretch bound hand and foot, inserted\r\nin one of the stone-throwing machines. His cries for mercy all unheeded,\r\nthe engine made two or three of its terrific swings, and then launched\r\nthe screaming \"varlet\" into the air, right over the battlements of\r\nAuberoche, \"so that he fell quite dead amid the other varlets, who were\r\nmuch terrified at it;\" and presently, the French knights, riding up to\r\nthe walls, shouted to the defenders: \"Gentlemen, inquire of your\r\nmessenger where he found the Earl of Derby, seeing that he has returned\r\nto you so speedily.\" But the Earl of Derby did come, and took signal\r\nvengeance. The battle, which Froissart tells in his best manner,\r\nresulted in the capture by the English of nine French viscounts, and \"so\r\nmany barons, squires, and knights, that there was not a man-at-arms\r\namong the English that had not for his share two or three.\"\r\n\r\nThe captains of the pillaging bands, who preyed both upon the English\r\nand the French, and the hired auxiliaries, who transferred their\r\nservices from one side to the other, were, however, miserable\r\nassassins, thirsting for blood. These men were frequently Bretons; and,\r\nsays Froissart, \"the most cruel of all Bretons was Geoffrey Tete-Noire.\"\r\nWith this Geoffrey Tete-Noire, continues the old chronicler, \"there was\r\na certain captain, who performed many excellent deeds of arms, namely,\r\nAimerigot Marcel, a Limousin squire, attached to the side of the\r\nEnglish.\" One of the \"deeds of arms\" performed under this worthy's\r\nauspices is narrated as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Aimerigot made one day an excursion, with only twelve companions, to\r\nseek adventures. They took the road towards Aloise, near St. Fleur,\r\nwhich has a handsome castle in the bishopric of Clermont. They knew the\r\ncastle was only guarded by the porter. As they were riding silently\r\ntowards Aloise, Aimerigot spied the porter sitting upon the branch of a\r\ntree without side of the castle. The Breton, who shot extraordinary well\r\nwith a cross-bow, says to him, 'Would you like to have that porter\r\nkilled at a shot?'--'Yea,' replied Aimerigot; 'and I hope you will\r\ndo so.' The cross-bow man shoots a bolt, which he drives into the\r\nporter's head, and knocks him down. The porter, feeling himself mortally\r\nwounded, regains the gate, which he attempts to shut, but cannot, and\r\nfalls down dead.\"\r\n\r\nThis delectable anecdote, Froissart--probably as kind-hearted a man by\r\nnature as any of his age--tells as the merest matter of course, and\r\nwithout a word of compunction or reproof. The fact is, that the gay and\r\nlettered canon of Chimay cared and thought no more of the spilling of\r\nblood which was not gentle, than he would of the scotching of a rat or\r\na snake. Lingeringly and wofully does he record the deaths of dukes, and\r\nviscounts, and even simple knights and squires, who have done their\r\n_devoirs_ gallantly; but as to the life-blood of the varlets--the\r\nvilains--the kernes--the villagios--the Jacques Bonhommes--foh! the red\r\npuddle--let it flow; blood is only blood when it gushes from the veins\r\nof a gentleman!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JASMIN.]\r\n\r\nThe evening was closing, and the mist stealing over the Garonne, when we\r\ncame alongside the pier at Agen. A troop of diligence _conducteurs_ and\r\ncanal touters immediately leaped on board, to secure the passengers for\r\nToulouse, either by road or water. Being, fortunately, not of the number\r\nwho were thus taken prisoners, I walked up through the sultry\r\nevening--for we are now getting into the true south--to the very\r\ncomfortable hotel looking upon the principal square of the town. One of\r\nmy objects in stopping at Agen was, to pay a literary visit to a very\r\nremarkable man--JASMIN, the peasant-poet of Provence and Languedoc--the\r\n\"Last of the Troubadours,\" as, with more truth than is generally to be\r\nfound in _ad captandum_ designations, he terms himself, and is termed by\r\nthe wide circle of his admirers; for Jasmin's songs and rural epics are\r\nwritten in the _patois_ of the people, and that _patois_ is the still\r\nalmost unaltered _Langue d'Oc_--the tongue of the chivalric minstrelsy\r\nof yore. But Jasmin is a Troubadour in another sense than that of merely\r\navailing himself of the tongue of the _ménestrels_. He publishes,\r\ncertainly--conforming so far to the usages of our degenerate modern\r\ntimes; but his great triumphs are his popular recitations of his poems.\r\nStanding bravely up before an expectant assembly of perhaps a couple of\r\nthousand persons--the hot-blooded and quick-brained children of the\r\nSouth--the modern Troubadour plunges over head and ears into his lays,\r\nworking both himself and his applauding audience into fits of enthusiasm\r\nand excitement, which, whatever may be the excellence of the poetry, an\r\nEnglishman finds it difficult to conceive or account for. The raptures\r\nof the New Yorkers and Bostonians with Jenny Lind are weak and cold\r\ncompared with the ovations which Jasmin has received. At a recitation\r\ngiven shortly before my visit at Auch, the ladies present actually tore\r\nthe flowers and feathers out of their bonnets, wove them into extempore\r\ngarlands, and flung them in showers upon the panting minstrel; while the\r\neditors of the local papers next morning assured him, in floods of\r\nflattering epigrams, that, humble as he was now, future ages would\r\nacknowledge the \"divinity\" of a Jasmin! There is a feature, however,\r\nabout these recitations, which is still more extraordinary than the\r\nuncontrollable fits of popular enthusiasm which they produce. His last\r\nentertainment before I saw him was given in one of the Pyrenean cities\r\n(I forget which), and produced 2000 francs. Every sous of this went to\r\nthe public charities; Jasmin will not accept a stiver of money so\r\nearned. With a species of perhaps overstrained, but certainly exalted,\r\nchivalric feeling, he declines to appear before an audience to exhibit\r\nfor money the gifts with which nature has endowed him. After, perhaps, a\r\nbrilliant tour through the South of France, delighting vast audiences in\r\nevery city, and flinging many thousands of francs into every poor-box\r\nwhich he passes, the poet contentedly returns to his humble occupation,\r\nand to the little shop where he earns his daily bread by his daily toil,\r\nas a barber and hairdresser. It will be generally admitted, that the man\r\ncapable of self-denial of so truly heroic a nature as this, is no\r\nordinary poetaster. One would be puzzled to find a similar instance of\r\nperfect and absolute disinterestedness in the roll of minstrels, from\r\nHomer downwards; and, to tell the truth, there does seem a spice of\r\nQuixotism mingling with and tinging the pure fervour of the enthusiast.\r\nCertain it is, that the Troubadours of yore, upon whose model Jasmin\r\nprofesses to found his poetry, were by no means so scrupulous.\r\n\"Largesse\" was a very prominent word in their vocabulary; and it really\r\nseems difficult to assign any satisfactory reason for a man refusing to\r\nlive upon the exercise of the finer gifts of his intellect, and throwing\r\nhimself for his bread upon the daily performance of mere mechanical\r\ndrudgery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A POET'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nJasmin, as may be imagined, is well known in Agen. I was speedily\r\ndirected to his abode, near the open _Place_ of the town, and within\r\nearshot of the rush of the Garonne; and in a few moments I found myself\r\npausing before the lintel of the modest shop inscribed, _Jasmin,\r\nPerruquier, Coiffeur de jeunes Gens_. A little brass basin dangled above\r\nthe threshold; and, looking through the glass, I saw the master of the\r\nestablishment shaving a fat-faced neighbour. Now, I had come to see and\r\npay my compliments to a poet; and there did appear to me to be something\r\nstrangely awkward and irresistibly ludicrous in having to address, to\r\nsome extent in a literary and complimentary vein, an individual\r\nactually engaged in so excessively prosaic and unelevated a species of\r\nperformance. I retreated, uncertain what to do, and waited outside until\r\nthe shop was clear.\r\n\r\nThree words explained the nature of my visit; and Jasmin received me\r\nwith a species of warm courtesy, which was very peculiar and very\r\ncharming--dashing at once, with the most clattering volubility and fiery\r\nspeed of tongue, into a sort of rhapsodical discourse upon poetry in\r\ngeneral, and his own in particular--upon the French language in general,\r\nand the _patois_ of it spoken in Languedoc, Provence, and Gascony in\r\nparticular. Jasmin is a well-built and strongly limbed man, of about\r\nfifty, with a large, massive head, and a broad pile of forehead,\r\noverhanging two piercingly bright black eyes, and features which would\r\nbe heavy were they allowed a moment's repose from the continual play of\r\nthe facial muscles, which were continually sending a series of varying\r\nexpressions across the swarthy visage. Two sentences of his conversation\r\nwere quite sufficient to stamp his individuality. The first thing which\r\nstruck me was the utter absence of all the mock-modesty, and the\r\npretended self-underrating, conventionally assumed by persons expecting\r\nto be complimented upon their sayings or doings. Jasmin seemed\r\nthoroughly to despise all such flimsy hypocrisy. \"God only made four\r\nFrenchmen poets!\" he burst out with; \"and their names are Corneille,\r\nLafontaine, Beranger, and Jasmin!\" Talking with the most impassioned\r\nvehemence, and the most redundant energy of gesture, he went on to\r\ndeclaim against the influences of civilization upon language and\r\nmanners as being fatal to all real poetry. If the true inspiration yet\r\nexisted upon earth, it burned in the hearts and brains of men far\r\nremoved from cities, _salons_, and the clash and din of social\r\ninfluences. Your only true poets were the unlettered peasants, who\r\npoured forth their hearts in song, not because they wished to make\r\npoetry, but because they were joyous and true. Colleges, academies,\r\nschools of learning, schools of literature, and all such institutions,\r\nJasmin denounced as the curse and the bane of true poetry. They had\r\nspoiled, he said, the very French language. You could no more write\r\npoetry in French now, than you could in arithmetical figures. The\r\nlanguage had been licked, and kneaded, and tricked out, and plumed, and\r\ndandified, and scented, and minced, and ruled square, and chipped--(I am\r\ntrying to give an idea of the strange flood of epithets he used)--and\r\npranked out, and polished, and muscadined, until, for all honest\r\npurposes of true high poetry, it was mere unavailable and contemptible\r\njargon. It might do for cheating _agents de change_ on the Bourse--for\r\nsquabbling politicians in the Chambers--for mincing dandies in the\r\n_salons_--for the sarcasm of Scribeish comedies, or the coarse\r\ndrolleries of Palais Royal farces; but for poetry the French language\r\nwas extinct. All modern poets who used it were mere _faiseurs de\r\nphrase_--thinking about words, and not feelings. \"No, no,\" my Troubadour\r\ncontinued; \"to write poetry, you must get the language of a rural\r\npeople--a language talked among fields, and trees, and by rivers and\r\nmountains--a language never minced or disfigured by academies, and\r\ndictionary-makers, and journalists; you must have a language like that\r\nwhich your own Burns (whom I read of in Chateaubriand) used; or like the\r\nbrave old mellow tongue--unchanged for centuries--stuffed with the\r\nstrangest, quaintest, richest, raciest idioms, and odd, solemn words,\r\nfull of shifting meanings and associations, at once pathetic and\r\nfamiliar, homely and graceful--the language which I write in, and which\r\nhas never yet been defiled by calculating men of science or jack-a-dandy\r\n_litterateurs_.\"\r\n\r\nThe above sentences may be taken as a specimen of the ideas with which\r\nJasmin seemed to be actually overflowing at every pore in his body, so\r\nrapid, vehement, and loud was his enunciation of them. Warming more and\r\nmore as he went on, he began to sketch the outlines of his favourite\r\npieces, every now and then plunging into recitation, jumping from French\r\nto _patois_, and from _patois_ to French, and sometimes spluttering them\r\nout, mixed up pell-mell together. Hardly pausing to take breath, he\r\nrushed about the shop as he discoursed, lugging out, from old chests and\r\ndrawers, piles of old newspapers and reviews, pointing me out a passage\r\nhere in which the estimate of the writer pleased him, a passage there\r\nwhich showed how perfectly the critic had mistaken the scope of his\r\npoetic philosophy, and exclaiming, with the most perfect _naivete_, how\r\nmortifying it was for men of original and profound genius to be\r\nmisconceived and misrepresented by pigmy whipper-snapper scamps of\r\njournalists. There was one review of his works, published in a London\r\n\"_Recueil_,\" as he called it, to which Jasmin referred with great\r\npleasure. A portion of it had been translated, he said, in the preface\r\nto a French edition of his works; and he had most of the highly\r\ncomplimentary phrases by heart. The English critic, he said, wrote in\r\nthe _Tintinum_; and he looked dubiously at me when I confessed that I\r\nhad never heard of the organ in question. \"_Pourtant_,\" he said, \"_je\r\nvous le ferai voir_:\" and I soon perceived that Jasmin's _Tintinum_ was\r\nno other than the _Athenæum_.\r\n\r\nIn the little back drawing-room behind the shop, to which the poet\r\nspeedily introduced me, his sister, a meek, smiling woman, whose eyes\r\nnever left her brother, following him as he moved with a beautiful\r\nexpression of love and pride in his glory, received me with simple\r\ncordiality. The walls were covered with testimonials, presentations, and\r\ntrophies, awarded by cities and distinguished persons, literary and\r\npolitical, to the modern Troubadour. Not a few of these are of a nature\r\nto make any man most legitimately proud. Jasmin possesses gold and\r\nsilver vases, laurel branches, snuff-boxes, medals of honour, and a\r\nwhole museum of similar gifts, inscribed with such characteristic and\r\nlaconic legends as--\"_Au Poete, Les Jeunes filles de Toulouse\r\nreconnaissantes_----.\" The number of garlands of _immortelles_, wreaths\r\nof ivy-jasmin (punning upon the name), laurel, and so forth, utterly\r\nastonished me. Jasmin preserved a perfect shrubbery of such tokens; and\r\neach symbol had, of course, its pleasant associative remembrance. One\r\nwas given by the ladies of such a town; another was the gift of the\r\nprefect's wife of such a department. A handsome full-length portrait had\r\nbeen presented to the poet by the municipal authorities of Agen; and a\r\nletter from M. Lamartine, framed, above the chimney-piece, avowed the\r\nwriter's belief that the Troubadour of the Garonne was the Homer of the\r\nmodern world. M. Jasmin wears the ribbon of the Legion of Honour, and\r\nhas several valuable presents which were made to him by the late ex-king\r\nand different members of the Orleans family.\r\n\r\nI have been somewhat minute in giving an account of my interview with M.\r\nJasmin, because he is really the popular poet--the peasant poet of the\r\nsouth of France--the Burns of Limousin, Provence, and Languedoc. His\r\nsongs are in the mouths of all who sing in the fields and by the cottage\r\nfiresides. Their subjects are always rural, _naive_, and full of rustic\r\npathos and rustic drollery. To use his words to me, he sings what the\r\nhearts of the people say, and he can no more help it than can the birds\r\nin the trees. Translations into French of his main poems have appeared;\r\nand compositions more full of natural and thoroughly unsophisticated\r\npathos and humour it would be difficult to find. Jasmin writes from a\r\nteeming brain and a beaming heart; and there is a warmth and a glow, and\r\na strong, happy, triumphant march of song about his poems, which carry\r\nyou away in the perusal as they carried away the author in the writing.\r\nI speak of course from the French translations, and I can well conceive\r\nthat they give but a comparatively faint transcript of the pith and\r\npower of the original. The _patois_ in which these poems are written is\r\nthe common peasant language of the south-west. It varies in some slight\r\ndegree in different districts, but not more than the broad Scotch of\r\nForfarshire differs from that of Ayrshire. As for the dialect itself, it\r\nseems in the main to be a species of cross between old French and\r\nSpanish--holding, however, I am assured, rather to the latter tongue\r\nthan the former, and constituting a bold, copious, and vigorous speech,\r\nvery rich in its colouring, full of quaint words and expressive phrases,\r\nand especially strong in all that relates to the language of the\r\npassions and affections.\r\n\r\nI hardly know how long my interview with Jasmin might have lasted, for\r\nhe seemed by no means likely to tire of talking, and his talk was too\r\ngood and too curious not to be listened to with interest; but the\r\nsister, who had left us for a moment, coming back with the intelligence\r\nthat there was quite a gathering of customers in the shop, I hastily\r\ntook my leave, the poet squeezing my hand like a vice, and immediately\r\nthereafter dashing into all that appertains to curling-irons, scissors,\r\nrazors, and lather, with just as much apparent energy and enthusiasm as\r\nhe flung into his rhapsodical discourse on poetry and language.\r\n\r\nHereabouts you begin to become sensible of a change in the cookery at\r\nthe _table-d'hôtes_; and in the gradually increasing predominance of oil\r\nand garlic, you recognise the kitchen influences of the sweet south.\r\nGarlic is a word of fear--of absolute horror to a great proportion of\r\nour countrymen, whose prejudices will permit them to learn no better. I\r\nadmit that the first whiff of the odorous root coming upon\r\ninexperienced nostrils is far from pleasant; indeed, I well remember\r\nbeing once driven from the table in a small _gasthoff_ at Strasbourg by\r\nthe fumes of a particularly strong sausage. Now, however, I think I\r\nshould know better. A relish for garlic, in fact, is one of those many\r\nacquired tastes which grew upon us with curious rapidity. You turn from\r\nthe first garlicky dish with dismay; the second does not appear quite so\r\nbad; you muster up courage, and taste the third. A strange flavour\r\ncertainly--nasty, too--but still--not irredeemably bad--there is a\r\nlurking merit in the sensation--and you try the experiment again and\r\nagain--speedily coming to Sir Walter Scott's evident opinions touching\r\nthe _petit point d'ail_, \"which Gascons love and Scotsmen do not\r\ndespise.\" Indeed, your friends will probably think it well if you\r\ncontent yourself with the _petit point_, and do not give yourself up to\r\na height of seasoning such as that which I saw in the _salle à manger_\r\nat Agen, drive two English ladies headlong from the room. Every body in\r\nthe South eats garlic, and you will find it for your interest, if but in\r\nself-defence, to do the same; while the oil eating is equally\r\ninfectious: you enter Provence, able just to stand a sprinkling upon\r\nyour salad--you depart from it, thinking nothing of devouring a dish of\r\ncabbage, chopped up, and swimming in the viscous fluid. The peasants all\r\nthrough the South eat and drink oil like so many Russians. Wandering\r\nthrough the dark and narrow streets of Agen--for we have now reached the\r\npoint where the eaves of the roofs are made to project so far as to cast\r\na perpetual shade upon the thoroughfare beneath--I came upon a group of\r\ntiny urchins, clustered round a grocer's shop, in great admiration of a\r\nrow of clear oil-flasks displayed in the window.\r\n\r\n\"_Tiens_,\" said one. \"_C'est de l'huile ça--de l'huile claire--ça doit\r\netre bon su' le pain--ça!_\" The little gourmand looked upon oil just as\r\nan English urchin would upon treacle.\r\n\r\nIt was from the heights above Agen--studded with the plum-trees which\r\nproduce the famous _prunes d'Agen_--that I caught my first glimpse of\r\nthe Pyrenees. I was sitting watching the calm uprising of the light\r\nsmoke from the leaf-covered town beneath, and marking the grand panorama\r\naround me--the masses of luxuriant vines climbing up the plum and\r\nfig-trees, and the earth frequently yellow with the bursting beds of\r\nhuge melons and pumpkins--when, extending my gaze over the vast expanse\r\nof champagne country, watered by the winding reaches of the Garonne, I\r\nsaw--shadowy as the phantoms of airy clouds, rising into the far bright\r\nair--faintly, very faintly traced, but still visible, a blue vision of\r\nsierrated and jagged mountain peaks, stretching along the horizon from\r\neast to west, forming the central portion of the great chain of peaks\r\nrunning from Perpignan to Bayonne, and certainly, at least, one hundred\r\nand twenty miles distant from me as the crow flies. There they\r\nstood,--Louis Quatorze to the contrary, notwithstanding--one of the\r\ngreat landmarks of the world; a natural boundary for ever; dividing a\r\npeople from a people, a tongue from a tongue, and a power from a power!\r\n\r\nBelow me, at the back of the town, once rose the ancient castle of Agen.\r\nIts ruins were demolished, with those of a cathedral, at the time of the\r\nRevolution; but its memory recalls a very curious story, developing the\r\ntrue character of the Black Prince, and shewing that, chivalrous and\r\ndaring as he was, his tongue had in it an occasional smack of the\r\nbraggart, and that the Foremost Knight of all the World could\r\noccasionally do uncommonly sneaking things. Thus it fell out:--In the\r\nyear 1368, the Lord of Aquitaine announced that he would raise a\r\nhearth-tax throughout Guienne. The measure was, of course, unpopular,\r\nand the Gascon lords appealed to the King of France, as Feudal Superior\r\nof the Prince; and the King sent, by two commissioners--a lawyer and a\r\nknight--a summons to Edward, to appear and answer before the Parliament\r\nof Paris. The emissaries were introduced in High Court, at Bordeaux,\r\ntold their tale, and exhibited their missives. The Black Prince heard in\r\nsilence, and then, after a long pause, he sternly and solemnly replied:\r\n\"Willing shall we be to attend on the appointed day at Paris, since the\r\nKing of France sends for us; but it will be with the helmet on our head,\r\nand sixty thousand men behind us.\"\r\n\r\nThe envoys fell on their knees, and bowed their heads to the ground.\r\nAfter the Prince had retired, they were assured that they would get no\r\nbetter answer; and so, after dinner, they set forth on the road to\r\nToulouse, where the Duke of Anjou lay, to convey to him the defiance of\r\nthe Englishman. Meantime, however, Edward began rather to repent the\r\nunconditional style of his reply, and to wish the ambassadors back\r\nagain. Perhaps, after all, he had been a little too hasty, and had gone\r\na little too far; so he called together the chief of his barons, and\r\nopened his mind to them. \"He did not wish,\" he said, \"the envoys to bear\r\nhis cartel to the King of France.\" In the opinion of the straightforward\r\npractitioners whom he consulted, the means of prevention were easy: what\r\nmore practicable and natural than to send out a handful of\r\nmen-at-arms--catch the knight and the lawyer, and then and there cut\r\ntheir throats? But Edward refused to commit unnecessary slaughter; and\r\npossibly exclaiming, as gentlemen in a drama and a dilemma always do--\"I\r\nhave it\"--he gave some private instructions to Sir William le Moine, the\r\nHigh Steward of Agenois, who immediately set forth at the head of a\r\nplump of spears. Meantime, the envoys were quietly jogging along, when,\r\nwhat was their horror and surprise at being suddenly pounced upon by the\r\nLord Steward, and arrested, upon the charge of having stolen a horse\r\nfrom their last baiting place. It was in vain that the unfortunate pair\r\noffered to bring any evidence of the falsity of the charge; Sir William\r\nhad as many witnesses as he commanded men-at-arms, and the victims were\r\nhurried to the castle of Agen, and left to their own reflections in the\r\nsecurest of its dungeons. When they got out again, or whether they ever\r\ngot out at all, Froissart does not condescend to inform us; but surely\r\nthe story shews the Black Prince in a new and not exactly favourable\r\nlight. We would hardly have expected to find the \"Lion whelp of\r\nEngland\" stooping to trump up a false accusation against innocent men,\r\nin order to shuffle out of the consequences of his own brag.\r\n\r\nI found it no easy matter to get comfortably from Agen to Pau:\r\ncross-country diligences are most untrustworthy conveyances. The pace at\r\nwhich they crawl puts it out of the question that they should ever see a\r\nsnail which they did not meet; while the terribly long stages to which\r\nthe horses are doomed, keeps one in a constant state of moral\r\ndiscomfort. However, I managed to get rattled and jangled on to Auch, on\r\nthe great Toulouse road, one of those towns which you wonder has been\r\nbuilt where it chances to lie, rather than anywhere else; and boasting a\r\ngrand old Gothic cathedral church, which Louis Quatorze, in the kindest\r\nmanner, enriched with a hugely clumsy Grecian portico, supported on fat,\r\ndropsical pillars. The question was now, how to get on to Pau. The\r\nToulouse diligence passed every day, but was nearly always full; I might\r\nhave to wait a week for a place. A _voiturier_, however, was to start in\r\nthe evening, and he faithfully promised to set me down at Tarbes, whence\r\nlocomotion to Pau is easy, in time for a late supper; and so with this\r\nworthy I struck a bargain. He shewed me a fair looking vehicle, and we\r\nwere to start at six. Punctually to the time, I was upon the ground, but\r\nno conveyance appeared. The place was the front of a carrier's shed,\r\nwith an army of _roulage_ carts drawn up before it. I kicked my heels\r\nthere in vain, for not a bit could I see of _voiture_ or _voiturier_.\r\nSeven struck--half-past seven--the north wind was bitterly cold, and a\r\nsleety rain began to fall. Had I absolute powers for ten minutes, like\r\nAbou Hassan, sorrowful would have been the fate of that _voiturier_. As\r\nit was, the wind got colder and colder; the streets became deserted, and\r\nthe rain and sleet lashed the rough pavement with a loud, shrieking\r\nrattle, when a wilder gust than common came thundering up the narrow\r\nstreet. At length, sick of cursing the scoundrel, I turned, for warmth,\r\ninto a vast, broad-eaved _auberge_, the house of call, I supposed, for\r\nthe carriers; and entering the great shadowy kitchen, almost as big and\r\nmassive looking a room as an old baronial hall, a voice I knew--the\r\nvoice of the rascally _voiturier_ himself--struck my ear, exclaiming\r\nwith the most warm-hearted affability, \"_Entrez, monsieur; entrez._ We\r\nwere waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\nWaiting for me! Surrounded by a group of men in blouses, and two or\r\nthree fat women, who were to be my fellow-passengers, there was the\r\nvillain, discussing a capital dinner--the bare-armed wenches of the\r\nplace rushing between the vast fireplace and the table, with no end of\r\nthe savouriest and the most garlicky of dishes, and the whole party in\r\nthe highest state of feather and enjoyment. The cool impertinence of the\r\ngreeting, however, tickled me amazingly; and room being immediately\r\nmade, I was entreated to join the company, and exhorted to eat, as it\r\nwould be a good many hours before I had another chance. This looked\r\nominous; and besides, the whole meal, full of nicely browned stews, was\r\nso appetising, that I fear I committed the enormity of making a very\r\ntolerable second dinner; and so about half-past eight we at last got\r\nunder weigh.\r\n\r\nBut not in the vehicle which I had been shown. There was some\r\ncock-and-bull story of that having been damaged; and we were\r\nsqueezed--six of us, including the fat ladies--into a dreadful square\r\nbox, with our twelve legs jammed together like the sticks of a faggot,\r\nin the centre. Oh, the woes of that dreary night!--the gruntings and the\r\ngroanings of the fat ladies--the squabbles about \"making legs,\" and,\r\nnotwithstanding our crowded condition, the intensity of the pinching\r\ncold--one window was broken, another wouldn't pull up, and the whole\r\nvehicle was full of cracks and crevices. Outside, the gale had increased\r\nto a hurricane; the rain and sleet lashed the ground, so that you could\r\nhardly hear the driver shouting at the full pitch of his voice to the\r\npoor jades, who drearily dragged us through the mire. After an hour or\r\ntwo's riding, the water began to trickle in on all sides. The fat ladies\r\nsaid they could not possibly survive the night; and a poor thin slip of\r\na soldier next me accepted half a railway wrapper with the most vehement\r\n\"_Merci-bien merci!_\" I ever heard in my life. About one in the morning\r\nwe pulled up at a lone public-house, in the kitchen of which the\r\npassengers refreshed themselves with coffee, and I myself, to their\r\ngreat surprise, with a liberal application of cognac and hot water. But\r\nthe French have no notion of the mellow beauties of toddy. The rest of\r\nthe night wore slowly and wretchedly on. I believe we had the same\r\nhorses all the way. Day was grey around us when we heard the voices of\r\nthe market people flocking in to Tarbes; and looking forth, after a\r\nshort, nightmareish dose, I beheld around me a wide champaign country,\r\nas white with snow as Nova Zembla at Christmas. And this was the boasted\r\nSouth of France, and the date was the twentieth of October!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTLE OF PAU.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPAU--THE ENGLISH IN PAU--ENGLISH AND RUSSIANS--THE VIEW OF THE\r\nPYRENEES--THE CASTLE--THE STATUE OF HENRI QUATRE--HIS BIRTH--A\r\nVISION OF HIS LIFE--ROCHELLE--ST. BARTHOLEMEW--IVRY--HENRI AND\r\nSULLY--HENRI AND GABRIELLE--HENRI AND HENRIETTE\r\nD'ENTRAGUES--RAVAILLAC.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcepting, perhaps, the famous city of Boulogne-sur-Mer, Pau is the most\r\nAnglicised town in France. There are a good many of our countrymen\r\ncongregated under the old steeples of Tours which every British man\r\nshould love, were it only for Quentin Durward; but they do not leaven\r\nthe mass; while in Pau, particularly during the winter time, the main\r\nstreet and the _Place Royale_ look, so far as the passengers go, like\r\nslices cut out from Weymouth, Bath, or Cheltenham. You see in an\r\ninstant the insular cut of the groups, who go laughing and talking the\r\nfamiliar vernacular along the rough _pavé_. There is a tall, muscular\r\nhoble-de-hoy, with red hair, high shirt collar, and a lady on each\r\narm--fresh-looking damsels, with flounces, which smack unmistakeably of\r\nEngland. It is a young gentleman with his sisters. Next come a couple of\r\nwonderfully well-shaved, well buttoned-up, fat, elderly, half-pay\r\nEnglish officers, talking \"by Jove, sir,\" of \"Wilkins of ours;\" and \"by\r\nGeorge, sir,\" of what the \"old Duke had said to Galpins of the 9th. at\r\nthe United Service.\" An old fat half-pay officer is always a major. I do\r\nnot know how it happens, but so it is; and when you meet them settled\r\nabroad, ten to one they have been dragged there by their wives and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, sir!\" said one of these veterans to me at Pau--he was very\r\nconfidential over a glass of brandy and water at the _café_ on the\r\n_Place_--\"By Jove, sir, for myself, I'd never like to go further from\r\nPall Mall than just down Whitehall, to set my watch by the Horse Guards'\r\nclock; but the women, you know, sir, have a confounded hankering for\r\nthese confounded foreign places; and, by Jove, sir, what is an old\r\nfellow who wants a quiet life to do, sir?\"\r\n\r\nThe colony of our country folks at Pau keep, as usual, very much\r\ntogether, and try to live in the most English fashion they may; ask each\r\nother mutually to cut mutton; display joints instead of _plats_, and\r\nimport their own sherry; pass half their time studying _Galignani_, and\r\nreading to each other long epistles of news and chat from England--the\r\nmajors and other old boys clustering together like corks in a tub of\r\nwater; the young people getting up all manner of merry pic-nics and\r\ndances, and any body who at all wishes to be in the set, going\r\ndecorously to the weekly English service.\r\n\r\n\"_Tenez_,\" said a Pau shopkeeper to me; \"your countrymen enjoy here all\r\nthe luxuries of England. They have even an episcopal chapel and a pack\r\nof fox-hounds.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the prosperity of Pau mainly depends upon its English\r\nresidents, who are generally well-to-do people, spending their money\r\nfreely. Shortly before my visit, however, a Russian prince, who had\r\nestablished himself in a neighbouring chateau, had quite thrown the\r\nEnglish reputation for wealth into the shade. His equipages, his\r\nparties, the countess's diamonds, had overblazed the grandeur of the\r\nEnglish all put together; and the way in which he spent money enraptured\r\nthe good folks of the old capital of Bearne. The Russians, indeed,\r\nwherever they go on the continent, deprive us of our _prestige_ as the\r\nrichest people in the world--an achievement for which they deserve the\r\nthanks of all Englishmen with heads longer than their purses.\r\n\r\n\"_Ah, monsieur!_\" I was once told, \"_la pluie de guineés, c'est bonne;\r\nmais le pluie de roubles, c'est une averse--un deluge!_\"\r\n\r\nGaston Phoebus, Count de Foix, was a sad Bluebeard of a fellow, but he\r\nshowed his taste in pitching upon a site for the castle of Pau. He\r\nreared its towers on the edge of a rocky hill. Far beneath sparkle the\r\nhappy waters of the Gave--appearing and disappearing in the broken\r\ncountry--a tumbling maze of wooded hill, green meadow, straggling\r\ncoppice, corn-fields, vineyards, and gardens--verily a land flowing with\r\nmilk and honey. Further on, sluggish round-backed hills heave up their\r\ngreen masses, clustered all over with box-wood; and then come--cutting\r\nwith many a pointed peak and jagged sierra--the bright blue sky--the\r\nglorious screen of the Pyrenees. From the end of the _Place_, which runs\r\nto the ridge of the bank on which stands the town, you may gaze at it\r\nfor hours--the hills towering in peak and pinnacle, sharp, ridgy,\r\nsaw-like--either deeply, beautifully blue, or clad in one unvarying garb\r\nof white; and beyond that, Spain. The same view from the castle is even\r\nstill finer, as you are more elevated; and the sheer sink of the wall\r\nand rock below you, makes, as it were, a vast gulf, across which the\r\nmind leaps, even over the green stumbling landscape of the foreground to\r\nthe blue or white peaks beyond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF HENRI QUATRE.]\r\n\r\nBut the feature--the characteristic--the essence--the very soul of\r\nPau--is neither the fair landscape, nor the rushing Gave, nor the\r\nstedfast Pyrenees. It is the memory of the good King Henri Quatre, which\r\nenvelopes castle and town--which makes haunted holy stones of these grim\r\ngrey towers--which gives all its renown and glory to the little capital\r\nof Bearne. Look up at the \"Good King\" in his bronze effigy in the\r\n_Place_. These features are more familiar to you than those of any\r\nforeign potentate. You know them of old--you know them by heart--a\r\ngoodly, honest, well-favoured, burly face--a face with mind and matter\r\nin it--a face not of an abstract transcendental hero, but emphatically\r\nof a MAN. Passion and impulse are there, as in the jaw of Henry VIII.;\r\nenergy and strong thought, as in the brow of Cromwell; a calm, and\r\ncourtly, and meditative smile over all, as in the face of Charles I. The\r\nstubbly beard grizzling round the firm and close-set lips, and worn by\r\nthe helmet, speaks the soldier--the conqueror of Ivry; the high, broad\r\nforehead and the quick eye tell of the statesman--he who proclaimed the\r\nedict of Nantes; the frank, gallant, and blithsome expression of the\r\nwhole face--what does it tell of--of the gallant, whose mingled sagacity\r\nand debonnair courage won La Reine Margot from the intrigues of\r\nCatherine; whose impulsive heart and fiery passions cast him at the feet\r\nof Gabrielle d'Estrees; and whose weakness--manly while unmanly--made\r\nhim for a time the slave of Henriette d'Entragues. There is an\r\nencyclopædia of meaning in the face, and even in the figure, of Henri.\r\nHe had a grand mind, with turbulent passions; he was deeply wise, yet\r\nfrantically reckless; he had many faults, but few vices. If he gave up a\r\nreligion for a throne, he never claimed to be a martyr or a saint.\r\nIndeed, he was the last man in the world deliberately to run his head\r\nagainst a wall. He thought that he could do more for the Huguenots by\r\nturning Catholic and King, than by remaining Protestant and Pretender;\r\nand he did it. Yet for all--for the men of Rome and the men of\r\nGeneva--he had a broad, genial, hearty sympathy. Were they not all\r\nFrench?--all the children of a king of France? Henri had not one morsel\r\nof bigotry in his soul: his mind was too clear, and his heart too big.\r\nAnd yet, with the pithiest sagacity--with the sternest will--with the\r\nmost exalted powers of calm comprehension--and the most honest wish to\r\nmake his good people happy--he could be recklessly\r\nvehement--Quixotically generous--he could fling himself over to his\r\npassions--do foolish things, rash things--insult the kingdom for which\r\nhe laboured, and which he loved--and thunder out his wrath at the grey\r\nhead of the venerable counsellor who stood by him in field and hall, and\r\nwhose practical wisdom it was which trimmed and shaped Henri's grand\r\nvisions of majestic politics and astounding plans for national\r\ncombinations. In the face, then, and in the figure of the Good King,\r\nyou can trace, I think, some such mixture of qualities. Neither are beau\r\nideals. You are not looking at an angel or an Apollo--but a bold,\r\npassionate, burly, good-humoured man, big in the bone, and firm in\r\nmuscle, with plenty of human flesh and its frailties, yet with plenty of\r\nmind to shine through, and elevate them all.\r\n\r\nLet us enter the castle of his birth. Thanks to Louis Philippe, it has\r\nbeen rescued from the rats and the owls, and re-fitted as exactly as\r\npossible in its ancient style. Mounting the grand staircase, we see\r\neverywhere around, on walls and vaulted ceiling, the gilt cyphers, \"H.\r\nM.\"--not, however, meaning Henri and Margot, but the grandfather of the\r\nKing of France--the stern, old Henri D'Albret, King of Navarre, and\r\nMargaret his wife--_La Marguerite des Marguerites_, the Pearl of Pearls.\r\nPass through a series of noble state-apartments, vaulted, oak-pannelled,\r\nwith rich wooden carved work adorning cornice and ceiling, and we stand\r\nin the room in which Henri saw the light. Jeanne D'Albret's bed, a huge\r\nstructure, massive and carven, and with ponderous silken curtains, still\r\nstands as it did at the birth of the king. And what a strange coming\r\ninto the world that was. The Princess of Navarre had travelled a few\r\ndays previously nearly across France, that the hoped-for son and heir\r\nmight be a Bearnais born. Old Henri, her father, was waiting and praying\r\nin mortal anxiety for the event. \"My daughter,\" said the patriarch, \"in\r\nthe hour of your trial you must neither cry nor moan, but sing a song\r\nin the dear Bearnais tongue; and so shall the child be welcomed to the\r\nworld with music, and neither weep nor make wry faces.\" The princess\r\npromised this, and she kept her word; so that the first mortal sound\r\nwhich struck Henri Quatre's ear was his mother's voice feebly chanting\r\nan old pastoral song of the shepherds of Bearne.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks be to God!--a man-child hath come into the world, and cried\r\nnot,\" said the old man. He took the infant in his arms, and, after the\r\nancient fashion of the land, rubbed its lips with a clove of garlic, and\r\npoured into its mouth, from a golden cup, a few drops of Jurancon wine.\r\nAnd so was born Henri Quatre. Stand for a moment in the shadow of these\r\ntapestried curtains, and call up in the gloom a vision of the grandly\r\neventful life which followed. An army is drawn up near Rochelle, and a\r\nlady leads a child between the lines. Coligni and the Condé head the\r\ngroup of generals who, bonnet in hand, surround the lady and the child;\r\nand then Jeanne D'Albret, lifting up her clear woman's voice, dedicates\r\nthe little Henri to the Protestant cause in France; and with loud\r\nacclamations is the gift received, and the leader accepted by the stern\r\nHuguenot array.--The next picture. An antique room in the Louvre. The\r\nbell of St. Germain l'Auxerrois is pealing a loud alarm; arquebus shots\r\nring through the streets, and cries and clamour of distress come\r\nmaddening through the air. Pale, but firmly resolute, stands Henri,\r\nbeside a young man richly, but negligently, dressed, who, after speaking\r\nwildly and passionately to him, snatches up an arquebus--stands for a\r\nmoment as though about to level it at his unshrinking companion, and\r\nthen exclaiming like a maniac, \"_Il faut que je tue quelq'un_,\" flings\r\nopen the lattice, and fires without. Henri and Charles IX. on the night\r\nof the St. Bartholemew.--Another vision. A battle-field: Henri\r\nsurrounded by his eager troops--the famous white plume of Ivry rising\r\nabove his helmet:\r\n\r\n    \"And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may,\r\n    For never saw I promise yet of a more bloody fray;\r\n    Charge where you see this white plume shine amid the ranks of war,\r\n    And be your oriflamme to day, the helmet of Navarre.\"\r\n\r\n--Solemn organ music floating through cathedral aisles must introduce\r\nthe next scene. The child who was dedicated to the cause of\r\nProtestantism kneels before a mitred priest. \"Who are you?\" is the\r\nquestion put. \"I am the king.\" \"And what is your request?\" \"To be\r\nadmitted into the pale of the Catholic Apostolic and Roman\r\nChurch.\"--Again a change. Henri the King of France, and Rosny, Duke de\r\nSully, labouring amid papers, calculations, and despatches, to elevate\r\nand make prosperous the great kingdom of France. \"I would,\" said the\r\nking, \"that every subject of mine might have a fat fowl in his pot every\r\nSunday.\"--Take another: a gay and courtly scene. A glittering mob of\r\ncourtiers surround a plain ferryman, who, in answer to the laughing\r\nquestions of the monarch, whom the boatman does not know, admits that\r\n\"the king is a good sort of fellow enough, but that he has a jade of a\r\nmistress, who is continually wanting fine gowns and trumpery trinkets,\r\nwhich the people have to pay for;--not, indeed, that it would signify so\r\nmuch if she were but constant to her lover; but they did say that----.\"\r\nHere a lady, with burning cheeks, and flashing eyes, exclaims: \"Sire,\r\nthat fellow must be hanged forthwith!\" \"Sire!\"--the boatman gazes in\r\nastonishment on his questioner. \"Tut, tut,\" is the reply; \"the poor\r\nfellow shall no longer pay _corvée_ or _gabelle_, and so will he sing\r\nfor the rest of his days, Vive Henri--Vive Gabrielle!\"--Another scene:\r\nin the library and working room of the great king, and his great\r\nminister. The monarch shews a paper, signed with his name, to his\r\ncounsellor. It is a promise of marriage to Henriette d'Entragues. Sully\r\nlooks for a moment at his master, then tears up the instrument, and\r\nflings the fragments on the earth. \"Are you mad, duke?\" shouts Henri.\r\n\"If I am,\" was the reply, \"I should not be the only madman in France.\"\r\nThe king takes his hand, and does him justice.--Yet one last closing\r\nsketch. In a huge gilded coach in the midst of a group of splendidly\r\ndressed courtiers, sits the king. There is an obstruction in the street.\r\nThe _cortège_ stops; the lackeys leave it to clear the way; when a\r\nmoody-browed fanatic, with flaming eyes, and red hair all on end, bounds\r\ninto the carriage--a poniard gleaming above his head--and in a moment\r\nthe Good King, stabbed with three mortal wounds, has gone home to his\r\nfathers. All is over: Henri Quatre is historical!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE VAL D'OSSAU--THE VIN DE JURANCON--THE OLD BEARNE COSTUME--THE\r\nDEVIL AND THE BASQUE LANGUAGE--PYRENEAN SCENERY--THE WOLF--THE\r\nBEAR--A PYRENEAN AUBERGE--THE FOUNTAIN OF LARUNS, AND THE EVENING\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valley of Ossau, one of the finest and most varied of the clefts\r\nrunning deep into the Pyrenees, opens up behind Pau, and penetrates some\r\nthirty miles into the mountains, ending in two narrow horns, both\r\nforming _cul de sacs_ for all, save active pedestrians and bold\r\nmuleteers, the bathing establishment of Eaux Bonnes being situated in\r\none, and that of Eaux Chaudes in the other. I was meditating as to my\r\nbest course for seeing some of the mountain scenery, as I hung over the\r\nparapet of the bridge beneath the castle, and watched the pure, foaming\r\nwaters of the Gave bursting over their rocky bed beneath, when a little\r\nman, with a merry red face, and a wonderfully long mouth, continually on\r\nthe grin, dressed in a species of imitation of English sporting\r\ncostume--in an old cut-away coat, and what is properly called a\r\nbird's-eye choker--the effect of which, however, was greatly taken off\r\nby sabots--addressed me, half in French, half in what he called\r\nEnglish:--Did I wish to go to the baths, or anywhere else in the hills?\r\nThe diligences had stopped running for the season; but what of that? he\r\nhad plenty of horses and vehicles: he would mount me for the fox-hounds,\r\nif I wished. Oh, he was well known to, and highly respected by,\r\nMessieurs les Anglais; and it was therefore a fortunate thing for me to\r\nhave fallen in with him. The upshot of a long conversation was, that he\r\nengaged to drive me up the glen with his own worshipful hands, business\r\nbeing slack at the time, and that he was to be as communicative as he\r\nmight touching the country, the people, their customs, and all about\r\nthem. The little man was delighted with this last stipulation, and\r\nobserved it so faithfully, that for the next two days his tongue never\r\nlay; and as he was a merry, sensible little fellow enough, and\r\nthoroughly good-natured, I did not in the least repent my bargain. Off\r\nwe went, then, in a lumbering old nondescript vehicle, drawn by a\r\nraw-boned white horse, who, however, went through his work like a\r\nTrojan. My driver's name was M. Martin; and the first thing he did was\r\nto pull up at the first public-house outside of Pau.\r\n\r\n\"Look up there!\" he said, pointing to a high-wooded ridge to the right;\r\n\"there are the Jurancon vineyards--the best in the Pyrenees; and here we\r\nshall have a _coup-d'étrier_ of genuine old Jurancon wine.\"\r\n\r\nRemembering Henri Quatre's first beverage, I had no objection. The wine,\r\nwhich is white, tastes a good deal like a rough _chablis_, and is very\r\ndeceptive, and very heady: I would advise new-comers to the Pyrenees to\r\nuse it but gingerly. The garrison of Pau was changed while I was there,\r\nand the new soldiers were going rolling about the streets--some of them\r\nmadly drunk, from the effects of this fireily intoxicating, yet mildly\r\ntasting wine. Our road lay along the Gave--a flashing, sparkling\r\nmountain-stream, running amid groups of trees, luxuriant coppice-wood,\r\nand small fields of yellow Indian corn. Many were the cottages and\r\nclusters of huts, half-hidden amid the vines, which are trailed in\r\nscreens and tunnels from stake to stake, and tree to tree; and, on each\r\nside of the way, hedges of box-wood, growing in luxuriant thickets,\r\nwhich would delight the heart of an English gardener--gave note of one\r\nof the characteristic natural harvests of the Pyrenees. The soil and the\r\nclimate are, indeed, such, that the place which, in more northern\r\nmountain regions, would be occupied by furze and heather, is hereabouts\r\ntaken up by perfect thickets and jungles of thriving box-wood; while the\r\nlaurel and rhododendron grow in bushy luxuriance. Charming, however, as\r\nis the landscape, and thoroughly poetic the first aspect of the\r\ncottages, they are in reality wretched, ricketty, and unwholesome\r\nhovels. In fact, poor huts, and a mountain country, go almost invariably\r\ntogether. In German Switzerland, the cottages are miserable; and every\r\nbody knows what an unwindowed stye is a Highland turf-built bothy. So of\r\nthe Pyrenean cottages: many of them--mere hovels of wood and clay, so\r\nrickety-looking, that one wonders that the first squall from the hills\r\ndoes not carry them bodily away--are composed of one large, irregular\r\nroom, having an earthen floor, with black, smoky beams stretching across\r\nbeneath the thatch. Two or three beds are made up in the darkest\r\ncorners; festoons of Indian corn, onions, and heads of garlic are\r\nsuspended from the rafters; and opposite the huge open fireplace is\r\ngenerally placed the principal piece of furniture of the apartment--a\r\nlumbering pile of a dresser, garnished with the crockery of the\r\nhousehold. In a very great proportion of cases, the windows of these\r\ndwellings are utterly unglazed; and when the rough, unpainted outside\r\nshutters are closed, the whole interior is in darkness. The people,\r\nhowever, seem better fed and better clothed than the German Switzers. In\r\nthe vicinity of Pau, the women wear the brightest silk handkerchiefs on\r\ntheir heads, are perfectly dissipated in the matter of gaudy ribbons,\r\nand cut their petticoats of good, fleecy, home-spun stuff, so short as\r\nto display a fair modicum of thick rig-and-furrow worsted stockings. The\r\nmen, except that they wear a blue bonnet--flat, like that called Tam\r\nO'Shanter in Scotland--are decently clad in the ordinary blouse. It is\r\nas you leave behind the influence of the town, that you come upon the\r\nancient dresses of the land. Every glen in Bearne has its distinguishing\r\npeculiarities of costume; but cross its boundary to the eastward, and\r\nyou relapse at once into the ordinary peasant habiliments of\r\nFrance--clumsy, home-cut coats only being occasionally substituted for\r\nthe blouse.\r\n\r\nThe old Bernais costume is graceful and picturesque; and as we made our\r\nway up into the hills, we soon began to see specimens; and hardly one of\r\nthese but was borne by a fine-looking, well-developed man, or a\r\nblack-eyed and stately stepping woman. The peasantry of Ossau are\r\nindeed remarkable, notwithstanding their hard work and frequent\r\nprivations, for personal beauty. They have little or no real French\r\nblood in their veins; indeed, I believe the stock to be Spanish, just as\r\nthe beauties of Arles, out of all sight the finest women in France, are\r\nin their origin partly Italian, partly Saracen. The women of Ossau are\r\nas swarthy as Moors, and have the true eastern dignity of motion, owing\r\nit, indeed, to the same cause as the Orientals--the habit of carrying\r\nwater-vases on their heads. Their faces are in general clearly and\r\nclassically cut--the nose thin and aquiline--the eye magnificently\r\nblack, lustrous, and slightly almond-shaped--another eastern\r\ncharacteristic. The dress, as I have said, is graceful, and the colours\r\nthoroughly harmonious. A tight-fitting black jacket is worn over a red\r\nvest, more or less gaudily ornamented with rough embroidery, and\r\nfastening by small belts across the bosom. On the head, a sort of capote\r\nor hood of dark cloth, corresponding to that of the jacket and\r\npetticoat, is arranged. In good weather, and when a heavy burden is to\r\nbe carried, this hood is plaited in square folds across the crown of the\r\nhead, forming a protection also from the heat of the sun. In cold and\r\nrainy days, it is allowed to fall down over the shoulders, mingling with\r\nthe folds of the drapery beneath. Both men and women wear peculiarly\r\nshaped stockings, so made as to bulge over the edges of the sabot, into\r\nwhich the naked foot is thrust. The dress of the men is of a\r\ncorrespondingly quaint character. On their heads they invariably wear\r\nthe flat, brown bonnet, called the _beret_, and from beneath\r\nit the hair flows in long, straight locks, soft and silky, and floating\r\nover their shoulders. A round jacket, something like that worn by the\r\nwomen, knee-breeches of blue velvet--upon high days and holidays--and,\r\nlike the rest of the costume, of coarse home-spun woollen upon ordinary\r\noccasions, complete the dress. The capa, or hood, is worn only in rough\r\nweather. In the glens more to the westward, low sandals of untanned\r\nleather are frequently used, the sole of the foot only being protected.\r\nSandals have certain classic associations connected with them, and look\r\nvery well in pictures, but they are fearfully uncomfortable in reality.\r\nI saw half-a-dozen peasants tramping in this species of _chaussure_\r\nthrough the wet streets of Pau amid a storm of snow and rain, and a\r\nspectacle full of more intensely rheumatic associations could no where\r\nbe witnessed.\r\n\r\nAs we jogged along behind the grey horse, the facetious M. Martin had a\r\njoke to crack with every man, woman, and child we encountered; and the\r\nblack eyes lighted up famously, and the classic faces grinned in high\r\ndelight, at the witticisms.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are speaking Bearne?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"The fine old language of the hills, sir. French!--no more to be\r\ncompared with it than skimmed milk with clotted cream.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you speak Spanish, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if a gentleman contrabanda, who takes walks over the hills in the\r\nlong dark nights, with a string of mules before him, wished to do a\r\nsmall stroke of business with me, I daresay we could manage to\r\nunderstand each other.\" And therewith M. Martin winked first with one\r\neye, and then with the other.\r\n\r\n\"And Basque,\" said I, \"you speak that also?\"\r\n\r\nM. Martin recoiled: \"No man who ever did live, or will live, could learn\r\na word of that infernal jargon, if he were not a born Basque. Learn\r\nBasque, indeed!--_Mon Dieu, monsieur!_ Don't you know that the Devil\r\nonce tried, and was obliged to give it up for a bad job? I don't know\r\nwhy he wanted to learn Basque, unless it were to talk to the fellows who\r\nwent to him from that part of the country; and he might have known that\r\nit was very little worth the hearing they could tell him. But, however,\r\nhe spread his wings, and flew and flew till he alighted on the top of\r\none of the Basque mountains, where he summoned all the best Basque\r\nscholars in the country, and there he was for seven years, working away\r\nwith a grammar in his hand, and saying his lessons like a good little\r\nboy. But 'twas all no use; he never could keep a page in his head. So\r\none fine morning he gave a kick to the books with one foot, and a kick\r\nto the masters with the other, and flew off--only able to say 'yes' and\r\n'no' in Basque, and that with such a bad pronunciation that the Basques\r\ncouldn't understand him.\"\r\n\r\nThis authentic anecdote brought us to that portion of the valley in\r\nwhich we enter really into the Pyrenean hills. Up to this point we have\r\nbeen traversing a gloriously wooded, and beautifully broken, country.\r\nRidges of forests, vineyard slopes, patches of bright-green meadow land,\r\nsteep, tumbling hills, wreathed with thickest box-wood, have been\r\nrising and falling all around. Lateral glens, each with its foaming\r\ntorrent and woodland vista opening up, have been passed in close\r\nsuccession. Scores of villages, ricketty and poverty-struck, even in\r\nthis land of fertility, have been traversed, until, gaining the height\r\nof a ridge which seems to block the way, we saw before us what appears\r\nto be another valley of a totally different character--stern, solitary,\r\nwild--a broad, flat space, lying between the hills, yellow with\r\nmaize-fields, the river shining in the midst, and on either side the\r\nmountain-slopes--no mere hills this time, but vast and stately Alps,\r\nheaving up into the regions of the mist, rising in long, uniform slopes,\r\nstretching away and away, and up and up--the vast sweeps green with a\r\nrichness of herbage unknown in the Alps, and faintly traced with ancient\r\nmountain-paths, leading from chalet to chalet; here and there a gully or\r\nwide ravine breaking the Titanic embankment; silver threads of\r\nwaterfalls appearing and disappearing in the black jaws; and over the\r\ntopmost clefts, glimpses of the snowy peaks, to which these stretching\r\nbraes lead upwards. The mist lies in long, thin wreaths upon the bosom\r\nof the hills immediately around you, and you see their bluff summits now\r\nrising above it, and then gradually disappearing in the rising vapour.\r\nThe general atmosphere is brighter and clearer than in the Alps, and you\r\nimagine a peak a long day's march from you within an easy climb;\r\ncottages, and even hamlets, appear perched at most impracticable\r\nheights; and every now and then, a white gash in the far-up hill-side\r\nannounces a marble-quarry, and you see dark dots of carts toiling up to\r\nit by winding ways. These hills are but partially wooded. The sombre\r\npine here begins to make its appearance, sometimes scattered, sometimes\r\ngrowing thickly--for all the world like the wire-jags set round the\r\nbarrel of a musical snuff-box. The lateral valleys are, however,\r\nfrequently masses of forest, and it is high up in these little\r\nfrequented passes, that Bruin, who still haunts the Pyrenees, most often\r\nmakes his appearance.\r\n\r\n\"But he is going,\" said M. Martin--\"going with the wild cats and the\r\nwolves. The Pyrenees are degenerating, monsieur; you never hear of a man\r\nbeing hugged to death now. Poor Bruin! For, after all, monsieur, he is a\r\ngentlemanly beast; he never kills the sheep wantonly. He always chooses\r\nthe best, which is but natural, and walks off with it. But the\r\nwolf--_sacré nom du diable!_--the wolf--a _coquin_--a brigand--a _Basque\r\ntonnere_--he will slaughter a flock in a night. _Mon Dieu!_ he laps\r\nblood till he gets drunk on it. A _voleur_--a _mauvais sujet_--a\r\n_cochon_--a dam beast!\"\r\n\r\n\"But do the Pyrenean wolves ever attack men?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sacré! Monsieur; tenez._ There was Jacques Blitz--an honest man, a\r\nfarmer in the hills; he came down to Pau, when the snow was deep, and\r\nthe winter hard. I saw him in Pau. Well, in the afternoon he started to\r\ngo home again. It looked threatening, and people advised him to stay;\r\nbut no; and off he went. Monsieur, that night in his cottage they heard,\r\nhour by hour, the howling of the wolves, and often went out, but could\r\nsee nothing. Poor Jacques did not return, and at sunrise they were all\r\noff in search; and sure enough they found a skeleton, clean picked, and\r\nthe bones all shining in the snow. Only, monsieur, the feet were still\r\nwhole in the sabots: the wolves had gnawed the wood, but could not break\r\nit. 'Take off the sabots!' screamed the wife. And they did so: and she\r\ngave a shuddering gasp, and said, 'They are Jacques' feet!' and tumbled\r\ndown into the snow. _Sacré peste_, the cannibals! Curse the\r\nwolves--here's to their extirpation!\"\r\n\r\nAnd M. Martin took a goodly pull at a bottle of Jurancon we had laid in\r\nat the last stage. He went on to tell me that sometimes a particular\r\nwolf is known to haunt a district, perhaps for years, before he gets his\r\n_quietus_; most probably a grey-haired, wily veteran, perfectly up to\r\nall the devices of the hunter, who can seldom get a shot at him. Bears\r\nflourish in the same fashion, and come to be so well known, as to be\r\nhonoured with regular names, by which they are spoken of in the country.\r\nOne old bear, of great size, and of the species in question, had taken\r\nup his head-quarters upon a range of hills forming the side of a ravine\r\nopening up from the valley of Ossau. He was called Dominique--probably\r\nafter his fellow Bruin, who long went by the same appellation in the\r\nJardin des Plantes, and was known by it to every Parisian. The Pyrenean\r\nDominique was a wily monster, who had long baffled all the address of\r\nhis numerous pursuers; and as his depredations were ordinarily confined\r\nto the occasional abstraction of a sheep or a goat, and as he never\r\nactually committed murder, he long escaped the institution of a regular\r\nbattue--the ordinary ending of a bear or wolf who manages to make\r\nhimself particularly conspicuous. At length the people of the district\r\ngot absolutely proud of Dominique. Like the Eagle in Professor Wilson's\r\nfine tale, he was \"the pride and the pest of the parish,\" and might have\r\nbeen so yet, were it not that on one unlucky day he was casually espied\r\nby the _garde forestiere_. This is a functionary whose duty it is to\r\npatrol the hills, taking note that the sheep are confined to their\r\nproper bounds on the pastures. The man had sat down to his dinner on a\r\nledge of rock, when, looking over it, whom should he see but the famous\r\nDominique sunning himself upon the bank below. The _garde_ had a gun,\r\nand it was not in the heart of man to resist the temptation. He fired,\r\nDominique got up on his hind legs, roaring grimly, when the contents of\r\nthe second barrel stretched him on the earth. So great, however, was the\r\n_garde's_ opinion of the prowess of his victim, that he kept loading and\r\nfiring long after poor Dominique had quitted this mortal scene. The\r\ncarcase was too heavy to be moved by a single man, but next day it was\r\ncarried to the nearest village by a funeral party of peasants, not\r\nexactly certain as to whether they ought to be glad or sorry at the\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nAs we were now well on in October, and as the weather had greatly broken\r\nup, much of the pleasure of my Pyrenean rambles being indeed marred by\r\nlowering skies and frequent and heavy rains--which were snow upon the\r\nhills--the flocks were fast descending from the upland pastures to their\r\nwinter quarters in the valley and the plain. Every couple of miles or\r\nso, in our upward route, we encountered a flock of small, long-eared,\r\nlong and soft woolled sheep, either trotting along the road or resting\r\nand grazing in the adjacent fields. The shepherds stalked along at the\r\nhead of the procession, or, when it was stationary, stood statue-like in\r\nthe fields. They were great, gaunt, sinewy men, wearing the Ossau\r\ncostume, but one and all enveloped in a long, whitish cloak, with a\r\npeaked hood, flowing to the earth, which gave them a ghastly,\r\nwinding-sheet sort of appearance. When a passing shower came rattling\r\ndown upon the wind, the herdsmen, stalking slowly across the fields,\r\nenveloped from head to foot in these long, grey, shapeless robes, looked\r\nlike so many Ossianic ghosts flitting among the mountains. Each man\r\ncarried, slung round him, a little ornamented pouch, full of salt, a\r\nhandful of which is used to entice within reach any sheep which he\r\nwishes to get hold of. One and all, like their brethren of the Landes,\r\nthey were busy at the manufacture of worsted stockings, and kept slowly\r\nstalking through the meadows where their flocks pastured, with the\r\nlounging gait of men thoroughly broken in to a solitary, monotonous\r\nroutine of sluggish life. Many of these shepherds were accompanied by\r\ntheir children--the boys dressed in exact miniature imitation of their\r\nfathers. Indeed, the prevalence of this style of juvenile costume in the\r\nPyrenees makes the boys and girls look exactly like odd, quaint little\r\nmen and women. The shepherds are assisted by a breed of noble dogs, one\r\nor two of which I saw. They are not, however, generally taken down to\r\nthe low grounds, as they are frequently fierce and vicious in the\r\nhalf-savage state in which it is of importance to keep them, in respect\r\nto their avocations amid the bears and wolves. Among themselves, I was\r\ntold that they fought desperately, occasionally even killing each other.\r\nThe dogs I saw were magnificent looking fellows, of great size and\r\npower, their chests of vast breadth and depth, and their limbs perfect\r\nlumps of muscle. They appeared to me to be of a breed which might have\r\nbeen originated by a judicious crossing of first-rate Newfoundlands, St.\r\nBernard mastiffs, and thorough old English bulldogs; and I could easily\r\nbelieve that one wrench from their enormous square jaws is perfectly\r\nsufficient to crash through the neck vertebræ of the largest wolf.\r\n\r\nAs we neared Laruns, the mountain-slopes grew steeper and higher, and\r\nmore barren and rugged; the precipices became more fearful; the mountain\r\ngorges more black and deep; and at length we appeared to be entering the\r\ndeep pit of an amphitheatre dug in the centre of a group of stormy and\r\nprecipitous mountains. Down in this nest lies the little mountain-town\r\nof Laruns; the steep slope of the heathy hill rising on one side of the\r\nsingle street from the very backs of the houses. M. Martin, on the Irish\r\nprinciple of reserving the trot for the avenue, whipped up the good old\r\ngrey, and we rattled at a canter through the miriest street I ever\r\ntraversed, driving throngs of lean, long-legged pigs right and left, and\r\ndispersing groups of cloaked, lounging men, with military shakos, and\r\nsabres--in whose uniform, indeed, I recognised that of my old friends,\r\nthe _Douaniers_ of Boulogne and Calais; for true we were approaching,\r\nnot indeed an ocean, but a mountain frontier, and Spanish ground was not\r\nso distant as Shakspeare's Cliff from Cape Grinez.\r\n\r\nWe stopped in the little Place opposite a pretty marble fountain, and at\r\nthe door of a particularly modest-looking auberge. As I was getting out,\r\nM. Martin stopped me: \"Wait,\" he said, \"and we will drive into the\r\nhouse--don't you see how big the door is?\" As he spoke, it opened upon\r\nits portals. The old grey needed no invitation, and in a moment we found\r\nourselves in a huge, dark vault, half coach-house, half stable. Two or\r\nthree loaded carts were lying about, and lanterns gleamed from the\r\ngloomiest corners, and horses and mules stamped and neighed as they were\r\nrubbed down, or received their provender.\r\n\r\n\"But where is the inn?\"\r\n\r\n\"The inn! up-stairs, of course.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then I beheld a rough, wooden staircase, or, rather, a railed\r\nladder, down which came tripping a couple of blooming girls to carry\r\nup-stairs our small amount of luggage. Following their invitation, I\r\nsoon found myself in a vast parlour and kitchen and all--a great shadowy\r\nroom, with a baronnial-looking fireplace, and a couple of old women\r\nsitting in the ingle-nook, plying the distaff. The fireplace and the\r\nkitchen department of the room were in the shadow at the back. Nearer\r\nthe row of lozenge-pane windows, rose a dais--with a long dining-table\r\nset out--and smaller tables were scattered around. Above your head were\r\nmighty rafters, capitally garnished with bacon and hung-meat of various\r\nkinds. The floor rose and fell in small mountains and valleys beneath\r\nyour feet; but, notwithstanding this evidence of rickettyness, every\r\nthing appeared of massive strength, and the warmth of the place, and the\r\nsavour of the _cuisine_--for a French kitchen is always in a chronic\r\nstate of cookery--made the room at once comfortable and appetising--ten\r\ntimes better than the dreary _salle_ of a barrack-like hotel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PYRENEES PARLOUR.]\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, Martin, having attended to the grey, joined me,\r\nrubbing his hands. \"This was the place to stop at,\" he said. \"No use of\r\ngoing further. The mountains beyond were just like the mountains here;\r\nbut the people here were far more unsophisticated than the people\r\nbeyond. They hav'nt learned to cheat here, yet,\" he whispered. \"And,\r\nbesides, you see a good Pyrenean auberge, and at the Wells you would\r\nonly see a bad French hotel, which, I daresay, would be no novelty;\r\nwhile, as for price--pooh! you will get a capital dinner here for what\r\nthey would charge you for speaking to the waiter there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved. Pending, the preparation of this dinner, however, I\r\nstrolled about Laruns. It is a drearily-poor place, with the single\r\nrecommendation of being built of stone, which can be had all round for\r\nthe carrying. The arrangement of turning the ground-floor into a stable\r\nis universal in the houses of any size, and as these stables also serve\r\nfor pig-styes, sheep-folds, and poultry-yards, and as cleaning-day is\r\nmade to come round as seldom as possible, it may be imagined that the\r\ntown of Laruns is a highly scented one. Through some of the streets,\r\nbrooks of sparkling water flow, working the hammers of feeble fulling\r\nmills. Webs of the coarse cloth produced are hung to dry from window to\r\nwindow, and roof to roof, and beneath them congregate groups of old\r\ndistaff-plying women, lounging _duaniers_, and no end of geese standing\r\nhalf asleep on one foot, until a headlong charge of pigs being driven\r\nafield, or driven home, comes trampling through the mire, and clears the\r\nway in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe auberge dinner was worthy of M. Martin's anticipations.\r\nDelicately-flavoured soup, and trout of the genuine mountain-stream\r\nbreed--the skin gaily speckled, and the flesh a deep red, were followed\r\nby a roasted _jigot_ of mutton, flavoured as only mutton can be\r\nflavoured which has fed upon the aromatic herbage of the high hills--the\r\nwhole finished off with a capital omelette, tossed jauntily up by the\r\nneat-handed Phillis who waited upon us, and joked, and laughed, and was\r\nkept in one perpetual blush by M. Martin all through dinner-time.\r\n\r\nAt length, through all this giggling, a plate was broken.\r\n\r\n\"There's bad luck, Jeanne,\" said Martin.\r\n\r\n\"You know nothing about it,\" replied Jeanne, pertly. \"Any child knows\r\nthat to break a plate is good luck: it is to smash a dish which brings\r\nbad luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have all sorts of omens here in the hills,\" said my companion. \"If\r\na hare cross the path, it is a bad omen; and if a cow kick over the\r\nmilking-pail, it is a bad omen. And they are always fancying themselves\r\nbewitched----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that we are not,\" interrupted Jeanne; \"so long as we keep a sprig\r\nof _vervene_ over the fire, we know very well that there's not a\r\n_sorciere_ in all the Pyrenees can harm us.\"\r\n\r\nI thought of the old couplet--\r\n\r\n    \"Sprigs of vervain, and of dill,\r\n    Which hinder witches of their will.\"\r\n\r\nAs the evening closed, the little Place became quite thronged with\r\ngirls, come to wash their pails and draw water from the fountain. Each\r\ndamsel came statelily along, bearing a huge bucket, made of alternate\r\nhorizontal stripes of brass and tin, upon her head, and polished like a\r\nmirror. A half-hour, or so, of gossipping ensued, frequently broken by a\r\npleasant chorus, sung in unison by the fresh, pure voices of the whole\r\nassembly. The effect, when they first broke out into a low, wailing\r\nsong, echoing amongst the high houses and the hill behind, was quite\r\nelectrifying. Then they set to work, scrubbing their pails as if they\r\nhad been the utensils of a model dairy, and at length marched away, each\r\nwith the heavy bucket, full to the brim, poised upon her head--and with\r\na carriage so steady and gracefully unswerving that, to look at the\r\npails, you would suppose them borne in a boat, rather than carried by a\r\nperson walking.\r\n\r\nAt night, after I had turned into as snug a bed, with as crisp, and\r\nwhite, and fresh linen as man could wish for, I was long kept awake by\r\nthe vocal performances of a party of shepherds, who had just arrived\r\nfrom the hills, and who paraded the Place singing in chorus, long after\r\nthe cracked bell in the little church had tolled midnight. Nine-tenths\r\nof these people have capital voices. Their lungs and throats are\r\nwell-developed, by holding communication from hill to hill; and they\r\njodle or jerk the voice from octave to octave, just as they do in the\r\nAlps. This said jodling appears, indeed, to be a natural accomplishment\r\nin many mountain countries. The songs of the shepherds at Laruns had\r\njodling chorusses, but the airs were almost all plaintive minors, with\r\nlong quavering phrases, clinging, as it were, to the pitch of the\r\nkey-note, and only extending to about a third above or below it. The\r\nmusic was always performed in unison, the words sometimes French, and\r\nsometimes Bearnais. The single phrase in the former language, which I\r\ncould distinguish, and which formed the burden of one of the ditties,\r\nwas, \"_Ma chere maitresse_.\" This \"_chere maitresse_\" song, indeed,\r\nappeared the favourite. Over and over again was it sung, and there was a\r\nwild, melancholy beauty which grew more and more upon you, as the mellow\r\ncadence died away again and again in the long drawn out notes of \"_Ma\r\nchere maitresse_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nRAINY WEATHER IN THE PYRENEES--EAUX CHAUDES OUT OF SEASON, AND IN\r\nTHE RAIN--PLUCKING THE INDIAN CORN AT THE AUBERGE AT LARUNS--THE\r\nLEGEND OF THE WEHRWOLF, AND THE BARON WHO WAS CHANGED INTO A BEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wakened next morning to a mournful _reveillé_--the pattering of the\r\nrain; and, looking out, found the Place one puddle of melting sleet. The\r\nfog lay heavy and low upon the hills, and the sky was as dismal as a\r\nLondon firmament in the dreariest day of November. Still, M. Martin was\r\nsanguine that it would clear up after breakfast. Such weather was\r\nabsurd--nonsensical; he presumed it was intended for a joke; but if so,\r\nthe joke was a bad one. However, it must be fine speedily--that was a\r\nsettled point--that he insisted on. Breakfast came and went, however,\r\nand the rain was steady.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said Jeanne, \"has lost the season of the Pyrenees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there not the summer of St. John to come yet?\" demanded Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but it will rain at least a week before then.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was one to do? There clearly was no speedy chance of the clouds\r\nrelenting; and what was sleet with us, was dry snow further up the pass.\r\nThe Peak du Midi, with visions of which I had been flattering myself,\r\nwas as inaccessible as Chimbarozo, Spain, of which I had hoped to catch\r\nat least a Pisgah peep--for I did want to see at least a barber and a\r\npriest--was equally out of the question. During the morning a string of\r\nmules had returned to Laruns, with the news that the road was blocked\r\nup; and truly I found that, had it not been so, my first step towards\r\ngoing to Spain must needs have been in the direction of Bayonne, to have\r\nmy passports _visèd_--those dreary passports, which hang like clogs to a\r\ntraveller's feet. And so then passed the dull morning tide away, every\r\nbody sulky and savage. Peasants, with dripping capas, stumbled up\r\nstairs, and sat in groups smoking over the fire; the two old women\r\nscolded; Jeanne grew quite snappish; and M. Martin ran out every moment\r\nto look at the weather, and came back to repeat that it was no lighter\r\nyet, but that it soon must clear up, positively. At length my companion\r\nand I determined upon a sally, at all events--a bold push. Let the\r\nweather do what it pleased, we would do what we pleased, and never mind\r\nthe weather. So old grey was harnessed in the stable; we blockaded\r\nourselves with wraps, and started bravely forth, a forlorn hope against\r\nthe elements. We took the way to Eaux Chaudes; and the further we went,\r\nthe heavier fell the rain--cats and dogs became a mild expression for\r\nthe deluge. The mist got lower and lower; the sleet got colder and\r\ncolder; old grey snorted and steamed; we gathered ourselves up under the\r\nmultitudinous wrappers; the rain was oozing through them--it was\r\ntrickling down our necks--suddenly making itself felt in small rills in\r\nunexpected and aggravating places, which made sitting\r\nunpleasant--collecting in handsome lakes at our feet, and pervading with\r\none vast, clammy, chilly, freezing dampness body and soul. The whole of\r\ncreation seemed resolved into a chaos of fog, mire, and rain. We had\r\npassed into what would be called in a pantomime \"the Rainy Realms, or\r\nthe Dreary Domains of Desolation;\" and what comfort was it--soaked,\r\nsodden, shivering, teeth chattering--to hear Martin proclaim, about once\r\nin five minutes, that the weather would clear up at the next turn of the\r\nroad? The dreary day remains, cold and clammy, a fog-bank looming in my\r\nmemory ever since. I believe I saw the _établissment_ of Eaux Chaudes;\r\nat least, there were big drenched houses, with shutters up, like\r\ndead-lights, and closed doors, and mud around them, like water round the\r\nark. They looked like dismal county hospitals, with all the patients\r\ndead except the madmen, who might be enjoying the weather and the\r\nsituation; or like gaols, with all the prisoners hung, and the turnkeys\r\nstarved at the cell doors for lack of fees. I remember hearing a doleful\r\nvoice, like that of Priam's curtain drawer, asking me if I wouldn't get\r\nout of the vehicle; but to move was hideous discomfort, bringing new wet\r\nsurfaces into contact with the skin; so I croaked out, \"No, no;\r\nback--back to the fire at Laruns.\" And so honest grey, all in a steam,\r\nsplashed round through the mud; and back we went as we had come--rain,\r\nrain, rain, pitiless, hopeless rain--the fog hanging like a grey winding\r\nsheet above us--the zenith like a pall above that, leaden and drear, as\r\non a Boothia Felix Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it but the fireside. The very _douaniers_ had\r\nabandoned the street--the pigs had retreated--the donkeys brayed at\r\nintervals from their ground-floor parlours; and only the maniac geese\r\nsat on one leg, croaking, to be rained on, and the marble fountain, so\r\npretty yester-evening in a gleam of sunshine, spouted away, bringing\r\n\"coals to Newcastle,\" with an insane perseverance which it made me sad\r\nto contemplate. Dinner was ordered as soon as it could be got ready; we\r\nfelt it was the last resource. I fortunately had a change of clothes.\r\nMartin had not; but he retired for awhile, and reappeared in a home-spun\r\ncoat and trowsers, six inches too long for him, which he was fain to\r\nhold up, to the enormous triumph and delight of Jeanne. At length, then,\r\nthat neat-handed Phillis announced dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Stay a moment!\" exclaimed Martin; \"I am just going to see whether it is\r\nlikely to clear up.\"\r\n\r\nOut he went into the mud, and returned with the announcement that it\r\nwould be summer weather in five minutes; he knew, by some particular\r\nmovement of the mist. But poor Martin's weather predictions had ceased\r\nto command any credit; and the peasants around the fire shrugged their\r\nshoulders and laughed. The dinner passed off like a funeral feast. I\r\nlooked upon the Place--still a puddle, and every moment getting deeper.\r\nNo songs--no jodling choruses to-night, maidens of Laruns!\r\n\r\nSitting gloomily over the Jurancon wine, and looking at the fire, I saw\r\na huge cauldron put on, and presently the steam of soup began to steal\r\ninto the room. Martin and Jeanne were holding confidential intercourse,\r\nwhich ended in my squire's coming to me, and announcing that there was\r\nto be held a grand _épeluche_ of the Indian corn, and that the soup was\r\nto form the supper of the work-people. Presently, sure enough, a vast\r\npile of maize in the husk was brought up, and heaped upon the floor; and\r\nas the dusk gathered, massive iron candlesticks with tapers which were\r\nrather rushlights than otherwise, were set in due order around the\r\ngrain. Then in laughing parties, drenched but merry, the neighbours\r\npoured in--men, women, and children--and vast was the clatter of tongues\r\nin Bernais, as they squatted themselves down on stools and on the floor,\r\nand began to strip off the husks of the yellow heads of corn, flinging\r\nthe peeled grain into coarse baskets set for the purpose. The old people\r\ndeposited themselves on settles in the vast chimney-nook; and amongst\r\nthem there was led to a seat a tall blind man, with grizzly grey hair,\r\nand a mild smiling face.\r\n\r\n\"Ask that man to tell you a story about any of the old castles or towns\r\nhereabouts,\" whispered Martin; \"he knows them all--all the traditions,\r\nand legends, and superstitions of Bearne.\"\r\n\r\nThis council was good. So, as soon as the whole roomful were at\r\nwork--stripping and peeling--and moistening their labours by draughts of\r\nthe valley vine--I proceeded to be introduced to the patriarch, but, ere\r\nI had made my way to him:\r\n\r\n\"Pere Bruniqul,\" said a good-humoured looking matron; \"you know you\r\nalways give us one of your tales to ease our work, and so now start off,\r\nand here is the wine-flask to wet your lips.\"\r\n\r\nAll this, and the story which followed, was spoken in Bernais, so that\r\nto M. Martin I am indebted for the outlines of the tale, which I treat\r\nas I did that of the Baron of the Chateau de Chatel-morant:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Sir Roger d'Espaigne,\" said the lady of the knight she\r\naddressed--holding in her hand the hand of their daughter Adele, a girl\r\nof six or seven years of age--\"where do you hunt to day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marry,\" replied her husband, \"in the domains of the Dame of Clargues.\r\nThere are more bears there than anywhere in the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know that the Dame of Clargues loves her bears, and would not\r\nthat they should be hurt; and besides, she is a sorceress, and can turn\r\nmen into animals, if she will. Oh, she practices cunning magic; and she\r\nis also a wehr-wolf; and once, when Leopold of Tarbes struck a wolf with\r\nan arblast bolt, and broke its right fore-leg, the Dame of Clargues\r\nappeared with her right-arm in bandages, and Leopold of Tarbes died\r\nwithin the year.\"\r\n\r\nBut Sir Roger was not to be talked to. He said the Dame of Clargues was\r\nno more a witch than her neighbours; and poising his hunting-spear, away\r\nhe rode with all his train--the horses caracolling, and the great wolf\r\nand bear-hounds leaping and barking before them. They passed the castle\r\nof the Dame of Clargues, and plunged into the forests, where the wolves\r\nlay--the prickers beating the bushes, and the knights and gentlemen\r\nready, if any game rushed out, to start in pursuit with their long,\r\nlight spears. For more than half the day they hunted, but had no\r\nsuccess; when, at last, a huge wolf leaped out of a thicket, and passed\r\nunder the very feet of the horses, which reared and plunged, and the\r\nriders, darting their spears in the confusion, only wounded each other\r\nand their beasts, while three or four of the best dogs were trampled on,\r\nand the wolf made off at a long gallop down the wood. But Sir Roger had\r\nnever lost sight of her, and now followed close upon her haunches,\r\nstanding up in his stirrups, and couching his lance. Never ran wolf so\r\nhard and well, and had not Sir Roger's horse been a Spanish barb, he had\r\nbeen left far behind. As it was, he had not a single companion; when,\r\ncoming close over the flying beast, he aimed a blow at her head. The\r\nspear glanced off, but blood followed the stroke, and at the same moment\r\nthe barb swerved in her stride, and suddenly stopping, fell a trembling,\r\nand laid her ears back, while Sir Roger descried a lady close by, her\r\nrobes rustling among the forest-herbs. Instantly, he leaped off his\r\nhorse, and advanced to meet and protect the stranger from the wolf; but\r\nthe wolf was gone, and, instead, he saw the Dame of Clargues with a\r\nwound in her left temple, from which the blood was still flowing.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Roger d'Espaigne,\" she said, \"thou hast seen me a wolf--be thou a\r\nbear!\" And even as she spoke, the knight disappeared, and a huge, brown\r\nbear stood before her.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" she cried, \"begone, and seek thy kindred in the\r\nforest-beasts--only hearken: thou shalt kill him who killest thee, and\r\nkilling him, thou shalt end thine own line, and thy blood shall be no\r\nmore upon the earth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the chase came up, they found the Spanish barb all trembling, and\r\nthe knight's spear upon the ground; but Sir Roger was never after seen.\r\nSo years went by, and the little girl, who had beheld her father go\r\nforth to hunt in the Dame of Clargues' domain, grew up, and being very\r\nfair, was wooed and wedded by a knight of Foix, who was called Sir Peter\r\nof Bearne. They had been married some months, and there was already a\r\nprospect of an heir, when Sir Peter of Bearne went forth to hunt, and\r\nhis wife accompanied him to the castle-gate, even as her mother had\r\nconvoyed her father when he went on his last hunting party to the woods\r\nof the Dame of Clargues.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Peter,\" said the lady, \"hast thou heard of a great bear in the\r\nforest, which, when he is hunted, the hunters hear a doleful voice,\r\nsaying, 'Hurt me not, for I never did thee any harm?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Balaam, of whom the clerk tells us, ought to have that bear to keep\r\ncompany with his ass,\" said the knight, gaily, and away he rode. He had\r\nhunted with good success most of the day, and had killed both boars and\r\nwolves, when he descried, couched in a thicket, a most monstrous bear,\r\nwith hair of a grizzly grey--for he seemed very old, but his eyes shone\r\nbright, and there was something in his presence which cowed the dogs,\r\nfor, instead of baying, they crouched and whined; and even the knights\r\nand squires held off, and looked dubiously at the beast, and called to\r\nSir Peter to be cautious, for never had such a monstrous bear been seen\r\nin the Pyrenees; and one old huntsman shouted out aloud, \"My lord, my\r\nlord--draw back, for that is the bear which, when he is hunted, the\r\nhunters hear a doleful voice, saying, 'Hurt me not, for I never did thee\r\nany harm!'\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the knight advanced, and drawing his sword of good\r\nBordeaux steel, fell upon the beast. The dogs then took courage, and\r\nflew at him; but the four fiercest of the pack he killed with as many\r\nblows of his paws, and the rest again stood aloof; so that Sir Peter of\r\nBearne was left face to face with the great beast, and the fight was\r\nlong and uncertain; but at last the knight prevailed, and the bear gave\r\nup the ghost. Then all the hunt rushed in, and made a litter, and with\r\nsongs and acclamations carried the dead bear to the castle, the knight,\r\nstill faint from the combat, following. They found the Lady Adele at the\r\ncastle-gate; but as soon as she saw the bear, she gave a lamentable\r\nscream, and said, \"Oh! what see I?\" and fainted. When she was recovered,\r\nshe passed off her fainting fit upon terror at the sight of such a\r\nmonster; but still, she demanded that it should be buried, and not, as\r\nwas the custom, cut up, and parts eaten. \"Holy Mary!\" said the knight,\r\n\"you could not be more tender of the bear if he were your father.\" Upon\r\nwhich, Adele grew very pale; but, nevertheless, she had her will, and\r\nthe beast was buried.\r\n\r\nThat night Sir Peter de Bearne suddenly rose in his sleep, and,\r\ncatching up arms which hung near him, began to fight about the room, as\r\nhe had fought with the bear. His lady was terrified, and the varlets and\r\nesquires came running in, and found him with the sweat pouring down his\r\nface, and fighting violently--but they could not see with what. None\r\ncould approach him, he was so savage, and he fought till dawn, and\r\nreturned, quite over-wearied, to his bed. Next morning he knew nothing\r\nof it; but the next night he rose again; and the next, and the next--and\r\nfought as before. Then they took away his weapons, but he ranged the\r\ncastle through, till he found them, and then fought more furiously than\r\never, till, at length, he was accustomed to fall on his knees with\r\nweakness and fatigue. Before a month had passed, you would not have\r\nknown Sir Peter: he seemed twenty years older; he could hardly drag one\r\nfoot after the other; and he fell melancholy and pined--for at last he\r\nknew that the curse of the bear was upon him, and that he was not long\r\nfor this world. Many then advised to send for the Dame of Clargues, who\r\nwas still alive, but old, and who was more skilful in such matters than\r\nany priest or exorcist on this side of Paris: and at last she was sent\r\nfor, and arrived. The scar upon her forehead was still to be seen; her\r\ngrey hair did not cover it.\r\n\r\n\"Lady,\" said she to the Lady of Bearne, \"did you ever see your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, truly; the very day he went forth a-hunting and never returned, I\r\nsaw him, and I yet can fancy the face before me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt see it to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then my foreboding--that strange feeling--was true. Oh! my father--my\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\nMidnight came, and, worn and haggard, Sir Peter de Bearne rose again to\r\nrenew his nightly combat. He staggered and groaned, and his strength was\r\nspent, and those who stood round sang hymns and prayed aloud. At length\r\nthe knight shrieked out with a fearful voice--the first time he had\r\nspoken in all his dreary sleep-fighting--\"Beast, thou hast conquered!\"\r\nand fell back upon the floor, his limbs twisting like the limbs of a man\r\nwho is being strangled; and Adele screamed aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Look, minion, look!\" exclaimed the Dame of Clargues to the\r\nlady--passing at the same time her hand over the lady's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"O God!\" cried Adele--\"my father kills my husband;\" and she fell upon\r\nthe floor, and she and the unborn babe died together, and Sir Peter de\r\nBearne was likewise lifted lifeless from the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTARBES--BAGNERRE DE BIGORRE--PIGEON-CATCHING--FRENCH COMMIS\r\nVOYAGEURS--THE KING OF THE PYRENEAN DOGS--THE LEGEND OF ORTHON,\r\nWHO HAUNTED THE BARON OF CORASSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day by noon--still raining--I was at Pau; and having bidden\r\nadieu to M. Martin, started for Bagnerre de Bigorre by Tarbes, the great\r\ncentre of Pyrenean locomotion. Here, as at Bordeaux, you are on ancient\r\nEnglish ground. The rich plain all around you is the old County of\r\nBigorre, which was given up to England as portion of the ransom of King\r\nJohn of France; and here to Tarbes came, with a gallant train, the Black\r\nPrince, to visit the Count of Argmanac--the celebrated Gaston Phoebus,\r\nCount of Foix--leaving his strong Castle of Orthon, to be present at the\r\nsolemnity. The life and soul of Tarbes now consist of the scores of\r\nsmall cross-country diligences, which start in every direction from it\r\nas a common centre. The main feature of the town is a huge square,\r\nnine-tenths of the houses being glaring white-washed hotels, with\r\n_messageries_ on the groundfloors. Diligences by the score lie\r\nscattered around; and every now and then the dogs'-meat old horses who\r\ndraw them go stalking solemnly across the square beneath the stunted\r\nlime-trees. There is an adult population of conductors, with silver\r\near-rings, and their hands in their pockets, always lounging about; and\r\na juvenile population of shoe-blacks, who swarm out upon you, and take\r\nyour legs by storm. Tarbes is the best place--excepting, perhaps,\r\nArles--for getting your boots blacked, I ever visited. If you were a\r\ncentipede, and had fifty pairs of Wellingtons, they would all be shining\r\nlike mirrors in a trice. How these boys live, I cannot make out, unless,\r\nindeed, upon the theory that they black their shoes mutually, and keep\r\ncontinually paying each other. Bagnerre is about sixteen miles distant;\r\nand a mountain of a diligence, not so much laden with luggage as\r\nfreighted with a cargo, conveyed me there in not much under four hours;\r\nand I repaired--it was dusk, and, of course, raining--to the Hotel de\r\nFrance--one of the huge caravansaries common at watering-places. A buxom\r\nlass opened the wicket in the Porte Cochere.\r\n\r\n\"I can have a room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, plenty!\"\r\n\r\nAnd we stepped into the open court-yard. The great hotel rose on two\r\nsides, and a small _corps de logis_ on the two others.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said the girl, \"until I get the key.\"\r\n\r\nAnd off she tripped. The key! Was the house shut up? Even so. I was to\r\nhave a place as big as a hospital to myself. The door opened; all was\r\ndarkness and a fusty smell. The last family had been gone a fortnight.\r\nOur footsteps echoed like Marianne's. It was decidedly a foreign\r\nedition, uncarpeted and waxy-smelling, of the \"Moated Grange.\" I was\r\nushered into a really splendid suite of rooms--of a decidedly grander\r\nnature than I ever occupied before, or ever occupied since.\r\n\r\n\"The price is the price of an ordinary bedroom. Monsieur may choose\r\nwhatever room he pleases; and the _table-d'hôte_ bell rings at six.\"\r\n\r\nThis, at all events, was reassuring. Then my conductress retreated; the\r\ndoors banged behind her, and I felt like a man shut up in St. Peter's.\r\nThe silence in the house was dreadful. I was fool enough to go and\r\nlisten at the door: dead, solemn silence--a vault could not be stiller.\r\nI would have given something handsome for a cat, or even a mouse; a\r\nparrot would have been invaluable--it would have shouted and screamed.\r\nBut no; the hush of the place was like the Egyptian darkness--it was a\r\nthick silence, which could be felt. At length the _table-d'hôte_ bell\r\nrang. The _salle à manger_ was in the building across the yard. Thither\r\nI repaired, and found a room, or rather a long corridor, big enough to\r\ndine a Freemason's or London Tavern party, with a miraculously long\r\ntable, tapering away into the distance. Upon a few square feet of this\r\ntable was a patch of white cloth; and upon the patch of cloth one plate,\r\none knife and fork, and one glass. This was the _table-d'hôte_, and,\r\nlike Handel, \"I was de kombany.\"\r\n\r\nNext day the weather was no better; but I was desperate, and sallied\r\nout in utter defiance of the rain; but such a dreary little city as\r\nBagnerre, in that wintry day, was never witnessed. I never was at Herne\r\nBay in November, nor have I ever passed a Christmas at Margate; but\r\nBagnerre gave me a lively notion of the probable delights of the dead\r\nseason at either of these favourite watering-places. The town seemed\r\ndefunct, and lying there passively to be rained on. Half the houses are\r\nlodging-places and hotels; and they were all shut up--ponderous green\r\noutside shutters dotting the dirty white of the walls. Hardly a soul was\r\nstirring; but ducks quacked manfully in the kennels, and two or three\r\nwretched donkeys--dreary relics of the season--stood with their heads\r\ntogether under the lime-trees in the Place. I retreated into a _café_.\r\nIf there were nobody in France but the last man, you would find him in a\r\n_café_, making his own coffee, and playing billiards with himself. Here\r\nthe room was tolerably crowded; and I got into conversation with a group\r\nof townspeople round the white Fayence stove. I abused the\r\nweather--never had seen such weather--might live a century in England,\r\nand not have such a dreary spell of rain--and so forth. The anxiety of\r\nthe good people to defend the reputation of their climate was excessive.\r\nThey were positively frightened at the prospect of a word being breathed\r\nin England against the skies of the Pyrenees in general, and those of\r\nBagnerre in particular. The oldest inhabitant was appealed to, as never\r\nhaving remembered such weather at Bagnerre. As for the summer, it had\r\nbeen more than heavenly. All the springs were delightful; the autumns\r\nwere invariably charming; and the winters, if possible, the best of the\r\nfour. The present rain was extraordinary--exceptional--a sort of\r\nphenomenon, like a comet or a calf with two heads. One of these\r\nworthies, understanding that however strong my objections were to fog\r\nand drizzle, I was not by any means afraid of being melted, recommended\r\nme to make my way to the Palombiere, and see them catch wild pigeons,\r\nafter a fashion only practised there and at one other place in the\r\nPyrenees. Not appalled, then, by the prospect of a three-mile pull\r\nup-hill, I made my way through the narrow suburban streets, and across\r\nthe foaming Adour, here a glorious mountain-stream, but already made\r\nuseful to turn numerous flour-mills, and to drive the saws and knives by\r\nwhich the beautiful marble of the Pyrenees is cut and polished.\r\nHereabouts, in the straggling suburbs, the whole female and juvenile\r\npopulation were clustered, just within the shelter of the open doors,\r\nknitting those woollen jackets, scarfs, and so forth, which are so much\r\nin vogue amongst the visitors in the season. There was one graceful\r\ngroup of pretty girls, the eldest not more than four years of age,\r\npursuing the work in a shed open to the street, seated round a loom, at\r\nwhich a good-natured-looking fellow was operating.\r\n\r\n\"That is a beautiful scarf,\" I said to the girl next me; \"how much will\r\nthey give you for making it?\"\r\n\r\nThe weaver paused in his work at this question. \"Tell the gentleman, my\r\ndear, how much Messieurs So-and-so give for knitting that scarf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two liards,\" said the little girl.\r\n\r\nTwo liards, or half a solitary sous! This was worse than the\r\nshirt-makers at home.\r\n\r\n\"It is a bad trade now,\" said the weaver. \"She is a child; but the best\r\nhands can't make more than big sous where they once made francs; but all\r\nthe trades of the poor are going to the devil. I don't think there will\r\nbe any poor left in twenty years--they will be all starved before then.\"\r\n\r\nThis led to a long talk with my new friend, who was a poor, mild, meek\r\nsort of man--a thinker, after his fashion, totally uninstructed--he\r\ncould neither read nor write--and a curious specimen of the odd twists\r\nwhich unregulated and unintelligent ponderings sometimes give a man's\r\nmind. His grand notion seemed to be, that whatever might be the isolated\r\ncrimes and horrors now and then committed upon the earth, the most\r\nterrible and malignant species of perverted human ingenuity was--the\r\nemployment of running streams to work looms.\r\n\r\n\"Was water made to weave cloth?\" he asked. \"Did the power that formed\r\nthe Adour intend its streams to be made use of to deprive an honest man\r\nof his daily bread? He would uncommonly like to find the orator who\r\nwould make that clear to his mind. It was terrible to see how men\r\nperverted the gifts of Nature! How could I, or any one else, prove to\r\nhim that the water beside us was intended to take the place of men's\r\narms and fingers, and to be used, as if it were vital blood, to\r\nmanufacture the garments of those who lived upon its banks?\"\r\n\r\nI ventured to hint, that running water might occasionally be put to\r\nanalogous, yet by no means so objectionable uses; and I instanced the\r\nflour and maize mill, which was working merrily within a score of paces\r\nof us. For a moment, but for a moment only, my antagonist was staggered.\r\nThen recovering himself, he inquired triumphantly whether I meant to say\r\nthat the process of grinding corn was like the process of weaving cloth?\r\nIt was curious to observe the confusion in the man's mind between\r\n_analogy_ and _resemblance_. As I could not but admit that the two\r\noperations were conducted quite in a different fashion, my gratified\r\nopponent, not to be too hard upon me, warily changed the immediate\r\nsubject of conversation. I was not a native of this part of France? Not\r\na native of France at all? Then I came from some place far away? Perhaps\r\nfrom across the sea? From England! Ah! well, indeed, there was an\r\nEnglish lady married, about five miles off--Madame----. Of course I knew\r\nher? No? Well, that was odd. He would have thought that, coming from the\r\nsame place, I ought to know her. However--were there many handloom\r\nweavers like himself in England? No, very few indeed. What! did they\r\nweave by water-power there, too? were the folks as bad as some of the\r\npeople in his country? I explained that, not being so much favoured in\r\nthe way of water-privilege, the people of England had resorted to steam.\r\n\r\nThe poor weaver was quite overcome at this crowning proof of human\r\nmalignity. It was more horrible even than the water-atrocities of the\r\nPyrenees.\r\n\r\n\"Steam!\"--he repeated the word a dozen times over, shaking his head\r\nmournfully at each iteration,--\"Steam! Ah, well, what is this poor\r\nunhappy world coming to?\"\r\n\r\nThen rousing himself, and sending the shuttle rattling backwards and\r\nforwards through the web, he added heartily: \"After all, their moving\r\niron and wood will never make the good, substantial, well-wearing cloth\r\nwoven by honest, industrious flesh and blood.\"\r\n\r\nWho would have the heart to prescribe cold political economy in such a\r\ncase? I left the good man busily pursuing his avocation, and lamenting\r\nover the perversity of making broad-cloth by the aid of boiling water.\r\n\r\nStretching manfully up hill, by a path like the bed of a muddy torrent,\r\nI was rewarded by a sudden watery blink of sunshine. Then the wind began\r\nto blow, and vast rolling masses of mist to move before it. From a high\r\nridge, with vast green slopes, all dotted with sheep, spreading away\r\nbeneath until they blended with the corn-land on the plain, Bagnerre\r\nappeared, the great white hotels peeping from the trees, and the whole\r\ntown lying as it were at the bottom of a bowl. It must be fearfully hot\r\nin summer, when the sun shines right down into the amphitheatre, and the\r\nhigh hills about, deaden every breeze. At present, however, the wind was\r\nrising to a gale, and blowing the heavy clouds right over the Pyrenees.\r\nAttaining a still greater height, the scene was very grand. On one side\r\nwas a confused sea of mountain-peaks and ridges, over which floated\r\nmasses of wreathing fog, flying like chased phantoms before the\r\nnorthern wind. Now a mountain-top would be submerged in the mist, to\r\nre-appear again in a moment. Anon I would get a glimpse of a long vista\r\nof valley, which next minute would be a mass of grey nonentity. The\r\nmist-wreaths rose and rolled beneath me and above me. Sometimes I would\r\nbe enveloped as in a dense white smoke; then the fog-bank would flee\r\naway, ascending the broad breast of the hill before me, and wrapping\r\ntrees, and rocks, and pastures in its shroud. All this time the wind\r\nblew a gale, and roared among the wrestling pines. Sometimes the sun\r\nlooked out, and lit with fiery splendour the rolling masses of the fog,\r\nwith some partial patch of landscape; and, altogether, the effect, the\r\nconstant movement of the mist, the wild, hilly landscape appearing and\r\ndisappearing, the glimpses occasionally vouchsafed of the distant plain\r\nof Gascony, sometimes dimly seen through the driving vapours, sometimes\r\ngolden bright in a partial blaze of sunshine,--all this was very\r\nstriking and fine. At length, however, I reached the Palombiere,\r\nsituated upon the ridge of the hill--which cost a good hour and a half's\r\nclimb. Here grow a long row of fine old trees, and on the northern side\r\nrise two or three very high, mast-like trees of liberty, notched so as\r\nto allow a boy as supple and as sure-footed as a monkey to climb to the\r\ntop, and ensconce himself in a sort of cage, like the \"crow's nest\"\r\nwhich whalers carry at their mast-heads, for the look-out. I found the\r\nfowlers gathered in a hovel at the foot of a tree; they said the wind\r\nwas too high for the pigeons to be abroad; but for a couple of francs\r\nthey offered to make believe that a flock was coming, and shew me the\r\nprocess of catching. The bargain made, away went one of the urchins up\r\nthe bending pole, into the crow's-nest--a feat which I have a great\r\nnotion the smartest topman in all Her Majesty's navy would have shirked,\r\nconsidering that there were neither foot-ropes or man-ropes to hold on\r\nby. Then, on certain cords being pulled, a whole screen of net rose from\r\ntree to tree, so that all passage through the row was blocked.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the chief pigeon-catcher, \"the birds at this season come\r\nflying from the north to go to Spain, and they keep near the tops of the\r\nhills. Well, suppose a flock coming now; they see the trees, and will\r\nfly over them--if it wasn't for the _pigeonier_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _pigeonier_! what is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to show you.\" And he shouted to the boy in the crow's nest,\r\n\"Now Jacques!\"\r\n\r\nUp immediately sprang the urchin, shouting like a possessed\r\nperson--waving his arms, and at length launching into the air a missile\r\nwhich made an odd series of eccentric flights, like a bird in a fit.\r\n\r\n\"That is the pigeonier,\" said the fowler; \"it breaks the flight of the\r\nbirds, and they swoop down and dash between the trees--so.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a tug to a short cord, and immediately the wall of nets, which\r\nwas balanced with great stones, fell in a mass to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur will be good enough to imagine that the birds are struggling\r\nand fluttering in the meshes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARBLE WORKS AT BAGNERRE.]\r\n\r\nAt Bagnerre there is a marble work--that of M. Géruset--which I\r\nrecommend every body to visit, not to see marble cut, although that is\r\ninteresting, but to pay their respects to, I believe, the grandest dog\r\nin all the world--a giant even among the canine giants of the Pyrenees.\r\nI have seen many a calf smaller than that magnificent fellow, who, as\r\nyou enter the yard, will rise from his haunches, like a king from his\r\nthrone, and, walking up to you with a solemn magnificence of step which\r\nis perfect, will wag his huge tail, and lead you--you cannot\r\nmisunderstand the invitation--to the counting-house door. For vastness\r\nof brow and jaw--enormous breadth and depth of chest, and girth of limb,\r\nI never saw this creature equalled. The biggest St. Bernard I ever came\r\nacross was almost a puppy to him. A tall man may lay his hand on the\r\ndog's back without the least degree of stoop; and the animal could not\r\ncertainly stand erect under an ordinary table.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" I said to the clerk who showed me the works, \"you have had\r\nmany offers for that dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"My employer,\" he replied, \"has refused one hundred pounds for him. But,\r\neven if we wished, we could not dispose of him: he is fond of the place\r\nand the people here; so that, though we might sell him, he wouldn't go\r\nwith his new master; and I would like to see any four men in Bagnerre\r\ntry to force him.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening I fortunately did not include the whole company at the\r\n_table-d'hôte_. There was a young gentleman very much jewelled, and an\r\nelderly lady also very strongly got up in the way of brooches and\r\nbracelets, to whom the young gentleman was paying very assiduous but\r\nvery forced attention. The lady was sulky, and sent _plat_ after _plat_\r\nuntasted away; and when her companion, as I thought, whispered a\r\nremonstrance, she snubbed him in great style; at which he bit his lip,\r\nturned all manner of colours, and then got moodily silent. I suspected\r\nthat the young gentleman had married the old lady for her money, and was\r\nleading just as comfortable a life as he deserved. But, besides them, we\r\nhad a couple of the gentlemen who are to be more or less found in every\r\nhotel in France--_commis voyageurs_, or commercial travellers. By the\r\nway, the aristocratic Murray lays his hand, or rather his \"Hand-book,\"\r\nheavily about the ears of these gentlemen--castigating them a good deal\r\nin the Croker style, and with more ferocity than justice: \"A more\r\nselfish, depraved, and vulgar, if not brutal set, does not exist;\"\r\n\"English gentlemen will take good care to keep at a distance from\r\nthem,\" and \"English ladies will be cautious of presenting themselves at\r\na French _table-d'hôte_, except\"--in certain cases specified. Now, I\r\nagree with Mr. Murray, that commercial travellers, French and English,\r\nare not distinguished by much polish of manner, or elegance of address;\r\non the contrary, the style of their proceedings at table is frequently\r\nslovenly and coarse, and their talk is almost invariably \"shop.\" In a\r\nword, they are not educated people, or gentlemen. But when we come to\r\nsuch expressions as \"selfish, brutal, and depraved,\" I think most\r\nEnglish travellers in France will agree with me, that the aristocratic\r\nhand-book maker is going more than a little too far. I have met scores\r\nof clever and intelligent _commis voyageurs_--hundreds of affable,\r\ngood-humoured ones--thousands of decent, inoffensive ones. In company\r\nwith a lady, I have dined at every species of _table-d'hôte_, in every\r\nspecies of hotel, from the Channel to the Mediterranean, and the Bay of\r\nBiscay to the Alps, and I cannot call to mind one instance of rudeness,\r\nor voluntary want of civility, from one end of our journey to the other;\r\nwhile scores and scores of instances of attention and kindness--more\r\nparticularly when it was ascertained that my companion was in weak\r\nhealth--come thronging on me. I know that the French _commis voyageur_\r\nlooks after his own interest at table pretty sharply, and also that he\r\nis quite deficient in all the elegant little courtesies of society; but\r\nto say that he is brutal or depraved, because he is not a _petit maître_\r\nand an _elegant_, is neither true nor courteous. If there be any set of\r\nFrenchmen to whose conduct at _table-d'hôtes_ strong expressions may be\r\nfairly applied, it is French officers, who sprung from a rank often\r\ninferior to that of the bagman, and, with all the coarseness of the\r\nbarracks clinging to them, frequently cluster together in groups of\r\nhalf-a-dozen--scramble for all that is good upon the table--eat with\r\ntheir caps on, which the _commis voyageur_ only does in winter, when the\r\nbare and empty _salle_ is miserably cold--and in general behave with a\r\ncoarse rudeness, and a tumultuous vulgarity, which I never saw private\r\nsoldiers guilty of, either here or in France.\r\n\r\nBut I must hurry my Pyrenean sketches to an end. The true South--I mean\r\nthe Mediterranean-washed provinces--still lie before me; and I must\r\nperforce leap almost at a bound over a long and interesting journey\r\nthrough the little-known towns of the eastern Pyrenees--quiet, sluggish,\r\ntumble-down places, as St. Gaudens, St. Girons, and St. Foix, possessed\r\nneither of pump-rooms, nor warm-springs, but vegetating on, lazily and\r\ndreamily, in their glorious climate--for, after all, it does sometimes\r\nstop raining, and that for a few blazing months at a time, too. I would\r\nlike to sketch St. Gaudens, with its broad-eaved, booth-like shops, and\r\nthe snug town-hall, with pictures of old prefects and wigged _fermiers\r\ngeneraux_, into which they introduced me, and where they set all their\r\nmunicipal documents before me, when I applied for some information as to\r\nthe landholding of the district. I would like to sketch at length a\r\ncurious walled village on the head waters of the Garonne--a\r\ndead-and-gone sort of place, of which I asked an old man the name. \"A\r\npoor place, sir,\" he said; \"a poor place. Not worth your while looking\r\nat. All poor people here, sir--poor people; not worth your while\r\nspeaking to. And the name--oh, a poor name, sir--not worth your while\r\nknowing; but, if you insist--why, then, it's Valentine.\" I would like to\r\nsketch the merry population in the hills round that dead-and-gone\r\nvillage--half farmers, half weavers, like the Saddleworth peasants, in\r\nYorkshire--a jolly set--all sporting men, too, who give up their looms,\r\nand go into the woods after bears as boldly as Sir Peter de Bearne. And\r\nI would like, too, to try to bring before my reader's eye the viney\r\nvalley of the Ariege, and the deep ravines through which the stream goes\r\nfoaming, spanned by narrow bridges, each with a tower in the centre,\r\nwhere the warder kept his guard, and opened and shut the huge,\r\niron-bound doors, and dropped and raised the portcullis at pleasure. And\r\nthese old feudal memorials bring me to the castles and ruined towers so\r\nthickly peopling the land where lived the bands of adventurers, as\r\nFroissart calls them, by whom the fat citizens of the towns were wont to\r\nbe \"_guerroyés et harriés_,\" and most of which have still their legends\r\nof desperate sieges, and, too often, of foul murders done within their\r\ndreary walls. Pass, as I perforce must, however, and gain\r\nProvence--there is yet one legendary tale I cannot help telling. It is\r\none of the best things in Froissart, and a little twisting would give it\r\na famous satiric significance against a class of bores of our own day\r\nand generation. It relates to the lord of a castle not far from Tarbes,\r\nand was told to Froissart by a squire, \"in a corner of the chapel of\r\nOrthez,\" during the visit paid by the canon to Gaston Phoebus, Count\r\nof Foix--who, I am sorry to say, has been puffed, and most snobbishly\r\nexalted by the great chronicler into the ranks of the most noble\r\nchivalry, in return for splendid entertainment bestowed; whereas, in\r\nfact, Gaston Phoebus was a reckless murderer, possessed of neither\r\nfaith nor honour. But, alas, the Canon of Chimay sometimes descended\r\ninto the lowest depths of penny-a-lining, and \"coloured\" the cases just\r\nas a bribed police reporter does when a \"respectable\" gentleman gets\r\ninto trouble. Gaston stabbed his son to death, in a dungeon; and the\r\nbold Froissart has actually the coolness to assert that the death of the\r\nheir took place, inasmuch as his father, in a rage, because he would not\r\neat the dainties placed before him, struck him with his clenched fist,\r\nholding therein a knife with which he had been picking his nails, but\r\nthe blade of which, says the lame apologist, only protruded a \"groat's\r\nbreadth\" from his fingers,--the result being that the steel\r\nunfortunately happened to cut a vein in young Gaston's throat. The\r\nsimple truth of the matter is, that the count was jealous of his son's\r\nbeing a favourite of the boy's mother, from whom he (the count) was\r\nseparated--that he dreaded lest the wrongs of his wife might be avenged\r\nby her brother, the King of Navarre--and that he determined to starve\r\nthe boy in a dungeon; but the child not dying so soon as was expected,\r\nhis father went very coolly in to him, and cut his throat.\r\n\r\n\"To speak briefly and truly,\" says Froissart, \"the Count de Foix was\r\nperfect in body and mind, and no contemporary prince could be compared\r\nto him for sense, honour, and liberality.\"\r\n\r\n\"To speak briefly and truly, Sir John Froissart,\" I reply, \"you have\r\nwritten a charming and chivalrous chronicle; but you could take a bribe\r\nwith any man of your time, and having done so, you could attempt to\r\ndeceive posterity, and write down what you knew to be a lie, with as\r\ngallant a grace and easy swagger as the great Mr. Jonathan Wild\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, there are black spots in the sun--to the legend which I\r\npromised. The Lord of Corasse--a castle, by the way, in which Henri\r\nQuatre passed some portion of his boyish days--the Lord of Corasse had a\r\nquarrel touching tithes with a neighbouring priest, who being unable to\r\nobtain his dues by ordinary legal or illegal remedies, sent a spirit to\r\nhaunt the castle of Corasse. This spirit proceeded to perform his\r\nmission by making a dreadful hallabuloo all night long, and breaking the\r\ncrockery--so that very soon the Lord and Lady of Corasse had to dine\r\nwithout platters. At length, however, the Baron managed to come to\r\nspeaking terms with the demon, who was invisible, and found out that his\r\nname was Orthon, and that the priest had sent him.\r\n\r\n\"But Orthon, my good fellow,\" said the sly Lord of Corasse, \"this priest\r\nis a poor devil, and will never be able to pay you handsomely. Throw him\r\noverboard at once, therefore, and come and take service with me.\"\r\n\r\nOrthon must have been the most fickle of all the devils, for he not only\r\nacceded to the proposition with astonishing readiness, but took such an\r\naffection to his new lord, that he could not be got out of his bedroom\r\nat night, to the sore discomfiture of the baroness, \"who was so much\r\nfrightened that the hairs of her head stood on end, and she always hid\r\nherself under the bed-clothes;\" while the too familiar demon, never\r\nseen, but only heard, insisted on keeping his friend, the baron,\r\nchatting all night. But the charms of Orthon's conversation at length\r\npalled, particularly as they kept the baron night after night from his\r\nnatural rest; so he took to despatching the demon all over Europe,\r\ncollecting information for him of all that was going on in the courts\r\nand councils of princes, and at the scene of war where there happened to\r\nbe fighting. Still, as Orthon moved as fast as a message by electric\r\ntelegraph, the baron found him nearly as troublesome as ever. He was\r\neternally coming in with intelligence which he insisted upon telling,\r\nuntil the Lord of Corasse's head was fairly turned by the amount of news\r\nhe was obliged to listen to. Never had there been so indefatigable an\r\nagent. He would have been invaluable to a newspaper--but he was boring\r\nthe Lord of Corasse to death.\r\n\r\nA loud thunder at the door at midnight. The baron would groan, for he\r\nknew well who was the claimant for admission. \"Let me in, Let me in. I\r\nhave news for thee from Hungary or England,\" as the case might be; and\r\nthe baron, groaning in soul and body, would get up and let the demon in;\r\nwhile the latter would immediately commence his recitation:\r\n\r\n\"Let me sleep. Let me sleep, for Heaven's sake!\" the victim would\r\nexclaim.\r\n\r\n\"I have not told thee half the news,\" would be Orthon's reply; \"I will\r\nnot let thee sleep until I have told thee the news;\" and he would go on\r\nwith his budget of foreign intelligence till the day scared him, and\r\nleft the baron and the baronness to broken and unrefreshing slumbers.\r\n\r\nFroissart narrates that at length the demon consented to appear in a\r\nvisible form to the baron; that he took the shape of a lean sow, upon\r\nwhich the Lord of Corasse ordered the dogs to be let loose upon the\r\nanimal, which straightway disappeared, and Orthon was never seen after.\r\nI suspect, however, that Sir John was hoaxed in this respect. He clearly\r\ndid not see the fun of the story, which is very capable of being\r\nresolved into an allegory--the fact being that the demon was some\r\ngentleman of the priest's acquaintance, with supernatural powers of\r\nboring whom he let loose upon the recalcitrant tithe-payer, until the\r\narrears were at length paid up. The sow which disappeared was clearly no\r\nother than a tithe-pig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLANGUEDOC--THE \"AUSTERE SOUTH\"--BEZIERS AND THE ALBIGENSES--THE\r\nFOUNTAIN OF THE GREVE AND PIERRE PAUL RIQUET--ANTICIPATIONS OF\r\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN--THE MISTRAL--THE OLIVE COUNTRY ABOUT\r\nBEZIERS--THE PEASANTS OF THE SOUTH--RURAL BILLIARD-PLAYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain in the banquette of the diligence, which, rolling on the great\r\nhighway from Toulouse to Marseilles, has taken me up at Carcassone, and\r\nwill deposit me for the present at Beziers. We have entered in\r\nLanguedoc, the most early civilised of the provinces which now make up\r\nFrance--the land where chivalry was first wedded to literature--the land\r\nwhose tongue laid the foundations of the greater part of modern\r\npoetry--the land where the people first rebelled against the tyranny of\r\nRome--the land of the Menestrals and the Albigenses. People are apt to\r\nthink of this favoured tract of Europe as a sort of terrestrial\r\nparadise--one great glowing odorous garden--where, in the shade of the\r\norange and the olive-tree, queens of love and beauty, crowned the heads\r\nof wandering Troubadours. The literary and historic associations have\r\nnot unnaturally operated upon our common notions of the country; and for\r\nthe \"South of France,\" we are very apt to conjure up a brave, fictitious\r\nlandscape. Yet this country is no Eden. It has been admirably described,\r\nin a single phrase, the \"Austere South of France.\" It _is_\r\naustere--grim--sombre. It never smiles: it is scathed and parched.\r\nThere is no freshness or rurality in it. It does not seem the country,\r\nbut a vast yard--shadeless, glaring, drear, and dry. Let us glance from\r\nour elevated perch over the district we are traversing. A vast, rolling\r\nwilderness of clodded earth, browned and baked by the sun; here and\r\nthere masses of red rock heaving themselves above the soil like\r\nprotruding ribs of the earth, and a vast coating of drowthy dust, lying\r\nlike snow upon the ground. To the left, a long ridge of iron-like\r\nmountains--on all sides rolling hills, stern and kneaded, looking as\r\nthough frozen. On the slopes and in the plains, endless rows of scrubby,\r\nugly trees, powdered with the universal dust, and looking exactly like\r\nmopsticks. Sprawling and straggling over the soil beneath them, jungles\r\nof burnt-up, leafless bushes, tangled, and apparently neglected. The\r\ntrees are olives and mulberries--the bushes, vines.\r\n\r\nGlance again across the country. It seems a solitude. Perhaps one or two\r\ndistant figures, grey with dust, are labouring to break the clods with\r\nwooden hammers; but that is all. No cottages--no farmhouses--no\r\nhedges--all one rolling sweep of iron-like, burnt-up, glaring land. In\r\nthe distance, you may espy a village. It looks like a fortification--all\r\nblank, high stone walls, and no windows, but mere loop-holes. A square\r\nchurch tower gloomily and heavily overtops the houses, or the dungeon of\r\nan ancient fortress rears its massive pile of mouldering stone. Where\r\nhave you seen such a landscape before? Stern and forbidding, it has yet\r\na familiar look. These scrubby, mop-headed trees--these formal square\r\nlines of huge edifices--these banks and braes, varying in hue from the\r\ngrey of the dust to the red of the rock--why, they are precisely the\r\nback-grounds of the pictures of the renaissance painters of France and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nI was miserably disappointed with the olive. It is one of the romantic\r\ntrees, full of association. It is a biblical tree, and one of the most\r\nfavoured of the old eastern emblems. But what claim has it to beauty?\r\nThe trunk, a weazened, sapless-looking piece of timber, the branches\r\nspreading out from it like the top of a mushroom, and the colour, when\r\nyou can see it for dust, a cold, sombre, greyish green. One olive is as\r\nlike another as one mopstick is like another. The tree has no\r\npicturesqueness--no variety. It is not high enough to be grand, and not\r\nirregular enough to be graceful. Put it beside the birch, the beech, the\r\nelm, or the oak, and you will see the poetry of the forest and its\r\npoorest and most meagre prose. So also, to a great extent, of the\r\nmulberry. I had a vague sort of respect for the latter tree, because one\r\nof the Champions of Christendom--St. James of Spain, I think--delivered\r\nout of the trunk of a mulberry an enchanted princess; but the enforced\r\nlodgings of the captive form just as shabby and priggish-looking a tree\r\nas the olive. The general shape--that of a mop--is the same, and a\r\nmutual want of variety and picturesqueness, afflict, with the curse of\r\nhopeless ugliness, both silk and oil-trees. The fig, in another way, is\r\njust as bad. It is a sneaking tree, which appears as if it were growing\r\non the sly, while its soft, buttery-looking branches--bending and\r\ntwisting, swollen and unwholesome-looking--put you somehow in mind of\r\ndiseased limbs, which the quack doctors call \"bad legs.\" In fact, it\r\nseems as if the climate and soil of Provence and Languedoc were utterly\r\nunfavourable to the production of forest scenery. One of our noble\r\nclumps of oak, beech, birch, and elm, at home, is worth, for splendid\r\npicturesqueness and rich luxuriance of greenery, every fig-tree which\r\never grew since fig-leaves were in vogue; every olive which ever grew\r\nsince the dove from the ark plucked off a branch; and every mulberry\r\nwhich ever grew since St. James of Spain cut out the imprisoned\r\nprincess. The menestrals of Languedoc no doubt gave our early bards many\r\na poetic lesson; but I can imagine the hopeless stare of the Southern\r\nwhen the Northern rhymer, in return, would chant him a jolly Friar of\r\nCopmanhurst sort of stave about the \"merry greenwood,\" and the joys of\r\nthe \"greenwood tree.\"\r\n\r\nAs we roll along the dusty highway, intersecting the dusty fields, the\r\ndusty olives, and the dusty vines, I pray the reader to glance to the\r\nright, towards the summit of a chain of jagged, naked hills. These go by\r\nthe name of the Black Mountains--a good \"Mysteries of Udolpho\" sort of\r\ntitle--and they form part of a range which separates the basin of the\r\nstreams which descend to the north, and form the head waters of the\r\nGaronne, and those which descend to the south, and form the head waters\r\nof the Aude. Somewhere about 1670, the scattered shepherds who dwelt in\r\nthese hills frequently observed a stranger, richly dressed, attended by\r\ntwo labouring-looking men, who paid him great reverence. The little\r\nparty toiled up and down in the hills, and frequently erected and\r\ngathered round magical-looking instruments. \"Holy Mary!\" said the\r\npeasants, \"they are sorcerers, and they are come to bewitch us all!\" For\r\nyears and years did the richly dressed man and the two labourers haunt\r\nthe Black Mountains, wandering uneasily up and down, climbing ridges,\r\nand plunging into valleys, and always seeming to seek something which\r\nthey could not find. At length, upon a glaring hot summer day, they came\r\nsuddenly upon a young peasant, who was quenching his thirst at a\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\nThe cavalier glanced at the spring, and caught the shepherd by his\r\nhome-spun jacket. The boy thought he was going to be murdered, and\r\nscreamed out; but a Louis-d'or quieted him in a moment. Then the\r\ncavalier, trembling with anxiety, exclaimed: \"What fountain is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fountain of the Greve,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\n\"And it runs both ways along the ridge of the hill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay; any fool may see that half of the water goes north, and half goes\r\nsouth--any fool knows that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I only discovered it now. Thank God!\"\r\n\r\nWe shall see who the cavalier, the discoverer of the fountain of the\r\nGreve, was, when we arrive at Beziers. Meantime the reader may be\r\nastonished that, after the cold frost and snow of the Pyrenees, a week\r\nor two later in the season brought me into a region of dry parched land,\r\nthe sky blue and speckless from dawn to twilight--the sun glaringly hot,\r\nand the flying dust penetrating into the very pores of the skin. But we\r\nhave left the mist-gathering and rain-attracting mountains, and we have\r\nentered the \"austere South,\" where the sky for months and months is\r\ncloudless as in Arabia--where, at the season I traversed it, the sun\r\nbeing hot by day does not prevent the frost from being keen at night;\r\nand where the mistral, or north wind, nips your skin as with knives;\r\nwhile in every sheltered spot the noon-day heat bakes and scorches it.\r\nBut such is Languedoc.\r\n\r\nAs the evening closed in, we saw, duskily crowning a hill before us, a\r\nclustered old city, with grand cathedral towers, and many minor church\r\nsteeples, cutting the darkening air. This is Beziers, where took place\r\nthe crowning massacre of the Albigenses--the most learned, intellectual,\r\nand philosophic of the early revolters from the Church of Rome, and whom\r\nit is a perfect mistake to consider in the light of mere peasant\r\nfanatics, like the Camisards or the Vaudois. In this ancient city,\r\nbeneath the shadow of these dim towers, more than twenty thousand men,\r\nwomen, and children, were slaughtered by the troops of orthodox France\r\nand Rome, led on and incited to the work by the Bishop of Beziers, one\r\nof the most black-souled bigots who ever deformed God's earth. When the\r\nsoldiers could hardly distinguish in the darkness the heretics from the\r\northodox--although, indeed, they might have solved the problem by\r\ncutting down every intelligent man they saw--the loving pastor of souls\r\nroared out, \"_Coedite omnes, coedite; noverit enim Dominus qui sunt\r\nejus!_\" It is to be fervently hoped, that, for the sake of the Bishop of\r\nBeziers, a certain other personage has long ago proved himself equally\r\nperspicuous and discriminating.\r\n\r\nWe pulled up at Hotel du Nord, at Beziers, just as the _table-d'hôte_\r\nbell was ringing; and I speedily found myself sitting down in a most\r\ngaily lighted _salon_, to a capital dinner, in the midst of a merry\r\ncompany. For the last ten miles of the way, I had been amusing myself by\r\ncatching glimpses of a distant lighthouse; for I knew that it shone from\r\na headland jutting into the Mediterranean. And the first glance at the\r\nMediterranean was now my grand object of interest, as the first glance\r\nat the Pyrenees had been; and as, I remember, long ago, the first glance\r\nof France, of the Rhine, and the Alps, had each their turn. When,\r\ntherefore, a dish of soles (stewed in oil, as the Jews cook them\r\nhere--and the Jews are the only people in England who can cook soles,)\r\nwas placed before me, I asked the waiter where the fish came from?\r\n\r\n\"_Mais, monsieur_, where should they come from, but from the sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the Mediterranean?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mais certainment, monsieur_; there is no sea but the Mediterranean\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\nAn observation which, coinciding with my own mental view for the moment,\r\nI quietly agreed in.\r\n\r\nIn the market-place of Beziers stands the statue of a thoughtful and\r\nhandsome man, dressed in the costume of the early period of Louis\r\nQuatorze, with flowing love-locks and peaked beard. His cloak has fallen\r\nunheeded from his shoulders, as he eagerly gazes on the ground--one hand\r\nholding a compass, the other a pencil. This is the statue of Pierre Paul\r\nRiquet, feudal seigneur of Bonrepos, and the cavalier who discovered the\r\nfountain of the Greve. That fountain solved a mighty problem--the\r\npossibility of connecting, by means of water communication, the\r\nAtlantic and the Mediterranean--the Garonne flowing into the one, with\r\nthe Aude flowing into the other; and the formation of the Canal du Midi,\r\ndoubled at a stroke the value of the Mediterranean provinces of France.\r\nFrancis I., although our James called him a \"mere fechting fule,\" dreamt\r\nof this. Henri and Sully projected the scheme; but it was only under\r\nLouis and Colbert that it was executed; and the bold and resolute\r\nengineer--he lived three quarters of a century before Brindley--was\r\nPierre Paul Riquet. This man was one of those chivalric enthusiasts for\r\na scheme--one of those gallant soldiers of an idea--who give up their\r\nlives to the task of making a thought a fact. He had laboured at least a\r\ndozen of weary years ere the court took up the plan. He had demonstrated\r\nthe thing again and again to commissioners of notabilities, ere the\r\nfirst stone of the first loch was laid. The work went on; twelve\r\nthousand \"navvies\" laboured at the task; Riquet had sunk his entire\r\nfortune in it. In thirteen years, the toil was all but accomplished. In\r\nthe coming summer the Canal du Midi would be opened--when Riquet\r\ndied--the great cup of his life's ambition brimming untasted at his\r\nlips. Six months thereafter, a gay company of king's commissioners,\r\ngracefully headed by Riquet's two sons, rode through the channel of the\r\nwater-courses from Beziers to Toulouse, and returned the next week by\r\nwater, leading a jubilant procession of twenty-three great barges,\r\nproceeding from the west with cargoes for the annual fair held on the\r\nRhone, at Beaucaire. Since Riquet's days, all his plans have been, one\r\nby one, carried out. His canal now runs to Agen, where it joins the\r\nGaronne; while at the other end, it is led through the chain of marshes\r\nand lagoons which extend along the Mediterranean, from Perpignan to the\r\ndelta of the Rhone, joining the \"swift and arrowy\" river at Beaucaire.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the mistral. I had heard a great deal previously about\r\nthis wind, and while at Beziers, had the pleasure of making its personal\r\nacquaintance. This mistral is the plague and the curse of the\r\nMediterranean provinces of France. The ancient historians mention it as\r\nsweeping gravel and stones up into the air. St. Paul talks of the south\r\nwind, which blew softly until there arose against it a fierce wind,\r\ncalled Euroclydon--certainly the mistral. Madame de Sevigne paints it as\r\n\"_le tourbillon, l'ouregan, tous les diables dechainés qui veulent bien\r\nemporter votre chateau_;\" and my amazement is, that the hurricane does\r\nnot sometimes carry bodily off, if not a chateau, at least the ricketty\r\nvillages of the peasants. I had but a taste of this wild, gusty, and\r\nmost abominably drying and cutting wind; for the gale which blew for a\r\ncouple of days over Beziers formed, I was told, only a very modified\r\nversion of the true mistral; but it was quite enough to give a notion of\r\nthe wind in the full height of its evil powers. The whole country was\r\nliterally one moving cloud of dust. The roads, so to speak, smoked. From\r\nan eminence, you could trace their line for miles by the columns of\r\nwhite powdered earth driven into the air. As for the paths you actually\r\ntraversed, the ground-down gravel was blown from the ruts, leaving the\r\nway scarred, as it were, with ridgy seams, and often worn down to the\r\nlevel of the subsidiary stratum of rock. The streaky, russet-brown of\r\nthe fields was speedily converted into one uniform grey. Never had I\r\nseen anything more intensely or dismally parched up. As for any tree or\r\nvegetable but vines and olives--whose very sustenance and support is\r\ndust and gravel, thriving under the liability to such visitations--the\r\nthing was impossible. Nor was the dust by any means the only evil. The\r\nwind seemed poisonous; it made the eyes--mine, at all events--smart and\r\nwater; cracked the lips, as a sudden alternation from heat to cold will\r\ndo; caused a little accidentally inflicted scratch to ache and shoot;\r\nand finally, dried, hardened, and roughened the skin, until one felt in\r\nan absolute fever. The cold in the shade, let it be noted, was\r\nintense--a pinching, nipping cold, in noways frosty or kindly; while in\r\nsheltered corners the heat was as unpleasant, the blaze of an unclouded\r\nsun darting right down upon the parched and gleaming earth. All this,\r\nhowever, I was told, formed but a modified attack of mistral. The true\r\nwind mingles with the flying dust a greyish or yellowish haze, through\r\nwhich the sun shines hot, yet cheerless. I had, however, a specimen of\r\nthe wind, which quite satisfied me, and which certainly enables me to\r\naffirm, that the coldest, harshest, and most rheumatic easterly gale\r\nwhich ever whistled the fogs from Essex marshes over the dripping and\r\nshivering streets of London, is a genial, balmy, and ambrosial zephyr,\r\ncompared with the mistral of the ridiculously bepuffed climate of the\r\nSouth of France.\r\n\r\nWandering about Beziers, so as to get the features of the olive country\r\nthoroughly into my head, I had a good deal of conversation with the\r\nscattered peasantry--a fierce, wild-looking set of people, dressed in\r\nthe common blouse, but a perfectly different race from the quiet, mild,\r\ncentral and northern agriculturists. Their black, flashing eyes, so\r\nbrimful of devilry--their wild, straight, black hair, shooting in\r\nstraggling masses over their shoulders, and the fierce vehemence of\r\ngesticulation--the loud, passionate tone of their habitual speech--all\r\nmark the fiery and hot-blooded South. Go into a cabaret, into the high,\r\ndarkened room, set round with tables and benches, and you will think the\r\nwhole company are in a frantic state of quarrel. Not at all--it is\r\nsimply their way of conversing. But if a dispute does break out, they\r\nleap, and scream, and glare into each other's eyes like demons, and the\r\nready knife is but too often seen gleaming in the air. Here in the South\r\nyou will note the change in the style of construction of the farmhouses,\r\nwhich are clustered in bourgs. Everything is on a great scale, to give\r\nair, the grand object being to let the breeze in, and keep the heat out.\r\nShade is the universal desideratum. Every auberge has its huge\r\n_remise_--a vast, gloomy shed, into which carts and diligences drive,\r\nwhere the mangers of the horses stand, and where you will often see the\r\ncarriers stretched out asleep. In large, messagerie hotels, these\r\n_remises_, ponderously built of vast blocks of stone, look like enormous\r\ncatacombs, or vaults; and the stamping and neighing of the horses, and\r\nthe rumbling of entering and departing vehicles, roll along the roof in\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nNear Beziers, I came upon a good specimen of the South of France bourg,\r\nor agricultural village. Seen from a little distance, it had quite an\r\nimposing appearance--the white, commodious-looking mansions gleaming\r\ncheerily out through the dusky olive-grounds. A closer inspection,\r\nhowever, showed the real nakedness of the land. The high, white mansions\r\nbecame great clumsy barns--the lower stories occupied as living places,\r\nthe windows above bursting with loads of hay and straw. The crooked,\r\ndevious streets were paved with filthy heaps of litter and dung.\r\nDilapidated ploughs and harrows--their wooden teeth worn down to the\r\nstumps--lay hither and thither round the great gaunt, unpainted\r\ndoorways. The window-shutters of every occupied room were shut as\r\nclosely as port-holes in a gale of wind, and here and there a wandering\r\npig or donkey, or a slatternly woman sifting corn upon a piece of\r\nsacking stretched before her door, or a purblind old crone knitting in\r\nthe sun, formed the only moving objects which gave life to the dreary\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nIn this village, however, dreary as it was, I found a _café_ and a\r\nbilliard-table. Where, indeed, in France will you not? Except in the\r\nmerest jumble of hovels, you can hardly traverse a hamlet without seeing\r\nthe crossed cues and balls figuring on a gaily painted house. You may\r\nnot be able to purchase the most ordinary articles a traveller requires,\r\nbut you can always have a game at pool. I have frequently found\r\nbilliard-rooms in filthy little hamlets, inhabited entirely by persons\r\nof the rank of English agricultural labourers. At home, we associate the\r\ngame with great towns, and, perhaps, with the more dissipated portion\r\nof the life of great towns. Here, even with the thoroughly rustic\r\nportion of the population, the game seems a necessary of life. And there\r\nare, too--contrary to what might have been expected--few or no\r\nmake-shift-looking, trumpery tables. The _cafés_ in the Palais Royal, or\r\nin the fashionable Boulevards, contain no pieces of furniture of this\r\ndescription more massive or more elaborately carved and adorned than\r\nmany I have met with in places hardly aspiring to the rank of villages.\r\nIt has often struck me, that the billiard-table must have cost at least\r\nas much as the house in which it was erected; but the thing seemed\r\nindispensable, and there it was in busy use all day long. A correct\r\nreturn of the number of billiard-tables in France would give some very\r\nsignificant statistics relative to the social customs and lives of our\r\nmerry neighbours. It would be an odd indication of the habits of the\r\npeople, should there be found to be five times as many billiard-tables\r\nin France as there are mangles; and I for one firmly believe that such\r\nwould be the result of an impartial perquisition. Besides the _billard_\r\nand the newspapers--little provincial rags, with which an English grocer\r\nwould scorn to wrap up an ounce of pigtail--there are, of course, cards\r\nand dominoes for the frequenters; and they are in as great requisition\r\nall day as the balls and cues. I like--no man likes better--to see the\r\ntoilers of the world released from their labours, and enjoying\r\nthemselves; but after all there is something, to English ways of\r\nthinking, desperately idle in the scene of a couple of big, burly\r\nworking men, sitting in the glare of the sunlight the best part of the\r\nday, wrangling over a greasy pack of cards, or rattling dominoes upon\r\nthe little marble tables. I once remarked this to an old French\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\"True--too true,\" he replied; \"it was Bonaparte did the mischief. He\r\nmade--you know how great a proportion of the country youth of\r\nFrance--soldiers. When they returned--those who did return--they had\r\ngarrison tastes and barrack habits; and those tastes and habits it was\r\nwhich have brought matters to the pass, that you can hardly travel a\r\nleague, even in rural France, without hearing the click of the billiard\r\nballs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRACK-BOAT ON THE CANAL DU MIDI--APPROACH TO THE\r\nMEDITERRANEAN--SALT-MARSHES AND SALT-WORKS--A CIRCUS\r\nTHRASHING-MACHINE--THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ITS CRAFT--CETTE AND\r\nITS MANUFACTURED WINES, WITH A PRIEST'S VIEWS ON GOURMANDISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Beziers for the Mediterranean, by Pierre Paul Riquet's canal. The\r\ntrack-boat passes once a-day, taking upwards of thirty-five hours to\r\nmake the passage from Toulouse to Cette. The Beziers station is about a\r\nmile from the town; and on approaching it early in the morning, I found\r\na crowd of people collected on the banks, looking at men dragging the\r\ncanal with huge hooks at the end of poles. They were searching for the\r\nbody of a poor fellow from Beziers, who had drowned himself under very\r\nremarkable circumstances; and just as the packet-boat came up, the\r\ncorpse was raised, stark and stiff, almost from beneath it. The deceased\r\nwas a _decrotteur_, or boot-cleaner, and a light porter at Beziers--a\r\nquiet, inoffensive man, who, by dint of untiring industry, and great\r\nself-denial, had scraped together upwards of two hundred and fifty\r\nfrancs, all of which he lent another _decrotteur_, without taking legal\r\nsecurity for the money. After the stipulated term for the loan had\r\nelapsed, the poor lender naturally pressed for his cash. He was put off\r\nfrom month to month with excuses; and when, at length, he became urgent\r\nfor repayment, the debtor laughed in his face, told him to do his best\r\nand his worst, and get his money how he could. The _decrotteur_ went\r\naway in a state of frenzy, and procured and charged a pistol, with which\r\nhe returned to the rascal borrower.\r\n\r\n\"Will you pay me?--ay or no?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the other; \"go about your business.\"\r\n\r\nThe creditor instantly levelled his pistol and fired. Down went his\r\nantagonist, doubled up in a heap on the road, and away went the assassin\r\nas hard as his legs could carry him, to a bridge leading over the canal,\r\nfrom the parapet of which he leaped into the water; while, as he\r\ndisappeared, the _quasi_ murdered man got up again, with no other damage\r\nthan a face blackened by the explosion of the pistol. He had fallen\r\nthrough terror, for he was absolutely unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe travelling by the Canal du Midi is a sleepy and monotonous business\r\nenough. Mile after mile, and league after league, the boat is gliding\r\nalong between grassy or rushy banks, and rows of poplar, and sometimes\r\nof acacia trees, the monotonous tramp of the team upon the bank mingling\r\nwith the endless gurgle of the waters beneath. The towing paths are\r\ngenerally very lifeless. Now and then a solitary peasant, with his heavy\r\nsharp-pointed hoe--an implement, in fact, half hoe and half\r\npick-axe--upon his shoulder, saunters up to see the boat go by; or a\r\nshepherd, whistling to his flock, paces slowly at their head, wandering\r\nto and fro in search of the greenest bits of pasture; or a handful of\r\njabbering women, from some neighbouring bourg, will be squatted along\r\nthe water's edge, certainly not obeying Napoleon's injunction to wash\r\ntheir _linge sale en famille_, but pounding away at sheets and shirts\r\nwith heavy stones or wooden mallets--the counterparts of the instruments\r\nused in Scotland to \"get up\" fine linen, and there called \"beetles.\" The\r\nbridges are shot cleverly. At a shout from the steersman, the\r\npostillion, who rides one of the hindmost horses of the team, jumps off,\r\ncasts loose the tow-line, runs with the end of it to the centre of the\r\nbridge, drops it aboard as the boat comes beneath, catches it up again\r\non the opposite side, flies back after his horses which have trotted\r\nvery tranquilly ahead, hooks on the rope again, jumps into his saddle,\r\ncracks his long whip, and the boat is off again in full career long ere\r\nshe has lost her former headway. Little of the country can be seen from\r\nthe deck, but along the southern and eastern half of the canal you\r\nseldom lose sight of the dusty tops of the formal olive groves, varied\r\nnow and then by a stony slope covered with ugly, sprawling vines, and as\r\nyou approach the sea, dotted with white, little country houses--of which\r\nmore hereafter--the glimpses of the changing picture being continually\r\nset in a brown frame of sterile hills.\r\n\r\nThe boats are long and narrow; the cabins like corridors, but\r\ncomfortably cushioned and stuffed, so that you can sleep in them, even\r\nif the boat be tolerably crowded, as well as in a diligence. If there be\r\nfew passengers, you will have full-length room. The _restaurant_ on\r\nboard is excellent--as good as that on the Garonne boats, and very\r\ncheap. Let all English travellers, however, beware of the steward's\r\ndepartment on the Loire and Rhone steamers, in both of which I have\r\nbeen thoroughly swindled. The style of people who seemingly use the\r\ntrack-boat on the Canal du Midi, are the _rotonde_ class of diligence\r\npassengers. Going down to Cette, there were two or three families,\r\nalmost entirely composed of females, aboard; the elder ladies--horrid,\r\nsnuffy old women, who were always having exclusive cups of chocolate or\r\ncoffee, or little basins of soup, and who never appeared to move from\r\nthe spots on which they were deposited since the voyage began.\r\n\r\nTwo of these families had canaries in cages, a very common practice in\r\nFrance, where the people continually try, even in travelling, to keep\r\ntheir household gods about them. Look at the baggage of your Frenchman\r\n_en voyage_. All the old clothes of the last dozen of years are sure to\r\nbe lugged about in it. There is, perhaps, a pormanteau, exclusively\r\ndevoted to old boots, and half-a-dozen pasteboard hat-boxes, with\r\nhalf-a-dozen hats, utterly beyond wearing. The plague of all this\r\nbaggage is dreadful; but the proprietor would go through any amount of\r\ninconvenience rather than lose one stitch of his innumerable old\r\n_hardes_.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the headland and dull old town of Agde, the former crowned\r\nby the lighthouse I had seen from the road to Beziers, we fairly entered\r\ninto the great zone of salt swamps which here line the Mediterranean. It\r\nwas a desolate and dreary prospect. The land on either side stretched\r\naway in a dead flat; now dry and parched, again traversed by green\r\nstreaks of swamp, and anon broken by clear, shallow pools of water.\r\nSometimes, again, you entered a perfect jungle of huge bulrushes,\r\nstretching away as far as the eye could follow, and evidently teeming\r\nwith wild ducks, which rose in vast coveys, and flew landward or seaward\r\nin their usual wedge-shaped order of flight. The sea, to which we were\r\napproaching at a sharp angle, was still invisible, but you felt the\r\nrefreshing savour of the brine in the air, and now and then you caught,\r\nsparkling for a moment in the bright, hot sunshine, a distant jet of\r\nfeathery spray, as a heavier wave than common came thundering along the\r\nbeach. Presently, the brown waste through which we were passing became\r\nstreaked with whitish belts and patches--the salt left by the\r\nevaporation of the brine, which now begins to soak and well through the\r\nspongy soil, and presently to expand into lakes and shallow belts of\r\nwater. Across these, long rows of stakes for nets, stretched away in\r\nendless column, and here and there a rude, light boat floated, or a\r\nfisherman slowly waded from point to point. Great herons and cranes\r\nstood like sentinels in the shallow water, and flocks of sandpipers and\r\nplovers ran along the white salt-powdered sand. Then came on the left,\r\nor landward side, a series of tumuli of pyramidical form, some of them\r\nwhite, others of a dark brown, scattered over a space of scores of\r\nsquare miles. I wondered who were the inhabitants of this lake of the\r\ndismal swamp, and accordingly pointed out the houses, as I conceived\r\nthem, to the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Houses, monsieur!\" he said; \"these are all salt heaps. Salt is the\r\nharvest of this country, and they stack it in these piles, just as the\r\npeople inland do their corn. When the heap is not expected to be wanted\r\nsoon, they thatch it with reeds and grass; but if they expect to get a\r\nquick sale, they don't take the trouble. So you see that some of the\r\nheaps are dark, and the others like snow-balls.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if there come rain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much fear of that in this part of the world. There may be a shower,\r\nbut the salt is so hard and compacted, that it will do little more than\r\nwash the dirt off.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THRASHING CORN.]\r\n\r\nPresently we came to the salt-making basins--great shallow lakes,\r\ndivided by dykes into squares somewhat in the style of a chess-board;\r\nand here the solitude of the expanse was broken by the figures of the\r\nworkmen clambering along the narrow dykes to watch and superintend the\r\nprogress of evaporation. By the side of these lakes, rows of ugly\r\nrectangular cottages were erected, and slight carts drawn by two horses,\r\none ahead of the other, moved the loads of salt from the pans, or pools,\r\nto the heaps in which it was stored. Here and there, where the ground\r\nrose a little, a thin crop of maize, or barley, appeared to have been\r\ncultivated; and it was probably some such harvest that I saw being\r\nthrashed by the peculiar process in use all through Provence and\r\nsouthern Languedoc. There are very few thrashing mills, even in the best\r\ncultivated parts of France. Over the vast proportion of the kingdom, the\r\northodox old flail bears undisturbed sway; but the farmer of the far\r\nSouth chooses rather to employ horse than human muscles in the work. He\r\nlays down, therefore, in a handy spot, a circular pavement, generally of\r\nbrick, a little larger than the ring at Astley's. All along the swampy\r\nshores of the Mediterranean, traversed by the delta of the Rhone, and\r\nstretching westward towards Spain, there feed upon the scanty herbage\r\ngreat herds of semi-wild horses, said to have been originally of Arabian\r\ndescent. These creatures are caught, when needed, much in the style of\r\nthe Landes desert steeds, and every farmer has a right to a certain\r\nnumber corresponding with the size of his farm. When, then, the harvest\r\nhas been cut, and the thrashing time comes on, you may see, approaching\r\nthe steeding, an unruly flock of lean, lanky, leggy horses, most of them\r\ngrey, driven by three or four mounted peasants--capital cavaliers--each\r\nwith a long lance like a trident held erect, and a lasso coiled at the\r\nsaddle-bow. Then work commences: the wild steeds are tolerably docile,\r\nalthough shy and skittish. A heavy bit is forced into the mouth of each,\r\nwith a long bridle attached. The creatures are arranged in a circle on\r\nthe edge of the brick flooring, exactly as when Mr. Widdicombe or M.\r\nFranconi prepare for an unrivalled feat of horsemanship upon eight\r\nbare-backed steeds by the \"Whirlwind Rider,\" surnamed the \"Pet of the\r\nRing,\" or the famous artiste, \"Herr Bridleinski, the Hungarian Tamer of\r\nthe Flying Steeds.\" The sheaves of corn are placed just where the active\r\ngrooms at Astley's rake the sawdust thickest; and then, in answer to the\r\nthundering exhortations of Mr. Widdicombe and his coadjutors in the\r\ncentre of the ring, and the cracking of the whips, the horses, held by\r\ntheir long bridles, go plunging and rearing round the arena, and, after\r\nmore or less obstreperousness, settle into a shambling trot, treading\r\nout the corn as they go, and preserving the pace for a wonderful length\r\nof time. At night, the creatures are released, and left to shift for\r\nthemselves. They seldom stray far from the farm, and are easily\r\nrecaptured and brought back to work next day. The four-legged thrashers,\r\nI am sorry to say, are rather scurvily treated, for they get nothing in\r\nreturn for their labour better than straw--a poor diet for a day's trot.\r\nThe first time I saw this equestrian thrashing-machine in motion, the\r\neffect was very odd. I could not dissociate it from the equestrian\r\nperformance of some wandering company of high-bred steeds and \"star\r\nriders.\" The only thing that seemed strange was, that there should be no\r\nspectators; and, after a little time, that there should be no human\r\nperformers. Round and round, at a long, irregular trot, went the lanky\r\nbrutes--sometimes breaking out--plunging, and taking it into their\r\nheads, as their Rochester cousin, hired by Mr. Winkle, did, to go\r\nsideways, but always reduced to obedience by a few smacking persuaders\r\nfrom the whip. But where was the illustrious Whirlwind Rider, who\r\nshould have stood on all their necks at once, or the famous Bridleinski,\r\nwho should have stood on all their haunches? No shrill clown's voice\r\nechoed from the circus. The stolid, bloused, straw-hatted master of the\r\nring was a perfect disgrace and reproach to Mr. Widdicombe, who, if he\r\nhad been on board the boat, would infallibly have taken refuge in the\r\nrun, rather than contemplated such a melancholy mockery of his mission\r\nand his functions.\r\n\r\nAt length there gleamed before us a noble sheet of water, ruffled by a\r\nsteady breeze, before which one of the Lateen-rigged craft of the\r\nMediterranean was bowling merrily, driving a rolling wave of foam on\r\neither side of her bluff bows. This was the Lagoon, or Etang, of Thau, a\r\nsalt-water lake about a dozen of miles long, and opening up by a narrow\r\nchannel--on both banks of which rises the flourishing town of\r\nCette--into the Mediterranean. For the greater part of its length, only\r\na strip of sand and shingle interposes between the lake and the sea, and\r\nas the steamer to which we were transferred, at the end of the canal,\r\npaddled its way to Cette, we could see every moment the surf of the open\r\nocean rising beyond the barrier. The passage along the Etang is pretty\r\nand characteristic. On the left lie, in a long, blue chain, the hills of\r\nthe Cevennes--distance hiding their barren bleakness from the eye--while\r\nalong the inland edge of the water, village after village, the houses\r\nsparklingly white, are mirrored in the lake, with a little fleet of\r\nlateen-rigged fishing boats, the sails usually very ragged, pursuing\r\ntheir occupation before each hamlet. Now and then we were passed by\r\nhuge feluccas, rolling away before the wind, and bound for the Canal du\r\nMidi, with great cargoes of hay and straw, heaped up half as high as the\r\nmast--the lateen-sail having to be half furled in consequence, and the\r\ncaptain shouting his orders to the steersman as from the top of a stack\r\nin a barnyard. The scene reminded me greatly of the hay-barges of the\r\nThames bringing up to London the crops of Kent and Essex.\r\n\r\nAt length we were landed among groups of Mediterranean sailors, with\r\nPhrygian caps--otherwise conical red night-caps--and ugly-looking knives\r\nin their belts. The women had the usual Naiad peculiarity of short\r\npetticoats, and wore them, too, of a showy, striped stuff, which\r\nreminded me of the Newhaven fish-wives, near Edinburgh. This Phrygian\r\ncap, by the way, is the prototype of the ordinary cap of liberty, which\r\nour good neighbours are so fond of sticking on the stumps of what they\r\ncall \"trees of liberty\"--of painting, of carving, of apostrophising, of\r\nwaving, of exalting--which, in short, they are so fond of doing\r\neverything with--but wearing. The effect, as a head-dress, on the Cette\r\nfishermen, was not unpleasant. The long, conical top, and tassel, give a\r\ndegree of drapery to the figure, and the cap itself seems luxuriously\r\ncomfortable to the head.\r\n\r\nA well-appointed little omnibus rattled me through busier streets than I\r\nhad seen for many a day, by open counting-houses, and under the great\r\nlateen yards of feluccas lying in rows, with their bows to the quays,\r\nand across a light, wooden swing-bridge, haunted by just such tarry\r\nmortals as you see about St. Katherine's docks; and at length I was set\r\ndown at the wide portal of the Hotel de Poste--a straggling, airy\r\nhostelry, such as befits the hot and glaring South. Still, I had not\r\nseen the Mediterranean. The great _coup_ was yet unachieved: so, getting\r\nfive words of instruction from a waiter, I hurried through some narrow\r\nstreets, crossed two or three more swing-bridges, skirted half-a-dozen\r\nboat-building yards, very like similar establishments in Wapping, and\r\nthen suddenly emerged upon the open beach, with sand-hills, and long\r\nbent, or seagrass, rustling in the soft southern wind, with the blue of\r\nthe great inland sea stretching away, deep and lovely, before me; and\r\nwith the hissing water and foam-laced inner wavelets of the surf\r\ncreaming to my feet. A sensation, it will be admitted, is a pleasant\r\nthing in these _blasé_ days, and the Mediterranean afforded one. There\r\ncame on me a vague, crowded, and indistinct vision, at once, of\r\nschoolboy recollections and many a subsequent day-dream--of Roman\r\ngalleys, _triremes_ and _quadremes_, with brazen beaks and hundred oars,\r\nmoving like the legs of a centipede; of all the picturesque craft of the\r\nmiddle-ages; of the fleets of Venice; the argosies and tall\r\nmerchant-barks which carried on the rich commerce of northern Italy; of\r\nthe Algerine corsairs, which so often bore down upon the Lion of St.\r\nMarks; of the quick-pulling piratical craft; the rovers who pillaged\r\nfrom the mouths of the Nile to the Pillars of Hercules; and of the whole\r\ntribe of modern Mediterranean vessels, which thousands and thousands of\r\npictures have made classic, with their high peaked sails, and striped\r\ngaudy canvass; the whole tribe of feluccas and polacres, whereof, as I\r\ngazed, I could see here and there the scattered sails, gleaming like\r\nbird-wings upon the sea. The Mediterranean is, after all, the sea of the\r\nworld: we associate it with everything classic and beautiful, either in\r\nart or climate; and although we know well that its lazy, saint-ridden\r\nseamen, and its picturesque, but dirty and ill-sailed, vessels would fly\r\nbefore a breeze which a North-sea fisherman or a Channel boatman would\r\nconsider a mere puff,--still there is something racily and specially\r\npicturesque about the black-eyed, swarthy, copper ear-ringed rascals,\r\nand something dearly familiar about the high, graceful peaks of the\r\nsails around which they cluster. From the beach I went to the harbour,\r\nwhich was crowded almost to its entrance, but, for reasons to be\r\npresently alluded to, I was not sorry to recognise not one union-jack\r\namong the Stars and Stripes--Dutch and Brazilian ensigns, which were\r\nflying from every mast-head. Few Mediterranean harbours are savoury\r\nplaces. It will be remembered that \"there shrinks no ebb in that\r\ntideless sea;\" and accordingly, when the drainage of a town or a\r\ndistrict is led into the harbours, there it stays. Marseilles enjoys a\r\nmost unenviable notoriety in this respect. The horrible fluid beneath\r\nyou becomes, in the summer time, despite its salt, absolutely putrid;\r\nand I was told that there had been instances in which it bred noisome\r\nand abhorrent insects and reptiles--that, literally and absolutely,\r\n\"slimy things did crawl, with legs, upon the slimy sea.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the stench, the richness of the steam of fat gases perpetually\r\nrising, must be smelt to be appreciated. The Marseillaise, however, have\r\nsturdy noses, which do not yield to trifles. They say the dirt preserves\r\nthe ships, and besides, adds Dumas--a great favourer of the ancient\r\ncolony of the Greeks--\"what a fool a man must be, who, under such a\r\nglorious sky, turns his eyes down to gaze on mud and water!\"\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Cette is not quite so bad, but it has no particular\r\ntransparency of water to recommend it. Brave its foulness, however, and\r\ngo and visit the quays for the fishing-boats, as they are returning from\r\ntheir night's toil. Mark the Catalan craft--you will perhaps remember\r\nthat the redoubted Monte Christo's first love was a Catalan girl, of a\r\nCatalan village near Marseilles:--did you ever see more\r\nexquisitely-formed boats afloat on the water? They swim apparently on\r\nthe very surface--the curve of the gunwale rising to a gondola peak at\r\nstem and stern; but yet they are most buoyant sea-boats, and I suspect\r\ntheir speed, particularly in light winds, would put even that of the\r\nYankee pilot-boats to a severe test. Look, too, at their cargoes, as the\r\nslippery masses are being shovelled up in glancing, gleaming spadefuls,\r\nto the quays. Did you ever see such odd fish? Respectable haddocks,\r\ndecent and well-to-do cods, and unpretending soles, would never be seen\r\nin such strange, eccentric company--among fellows with heads bigger than\r\nbodies, and eyes in their backs, and tails absurdly misplaced, and\r\nfeelers or legs where no fish with well-regulated minds would dream of\r\nhaving such appendages--never was there seen such a strange _omnium\r\ngatherum_ of piscatory eccentricities as the fishes of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nI said that it was good--good for our stomachs--to see no English\r\nbunting at Cette. The reason is, that Cette is a great manufacturing\r\nplace, and that what they manufacture there is neither cotton nor wool,\r\nPerigord pies, nor Rheims biscuits,--but wine. \"_Ici_,\" will a Cette\r\nindustrial write with the greatest coolness over his Porte\r\nCochere--\"_Ici on fabrique des vins._\" All the wines in the world,\r\nindeed, are made in Cette. You have only to give an order for\r\nJohannisberg, or Tokay--nay, for all I know, for the Falernian of the\r\nRomans, or the Nectar of the gods--and the Cette manufacturers will\r\npromptly supply you. They are great chemists, these gentlemen, and have\r\nbrought the noble art of adulteration to a perfection which would make\r\nour own mere logwood and sloe-juice practitioners pale and wan with\r\nenvy. But the great trade of the place is not so much adulterating as\r\nconcocting wine. Cette is well-situated for this notable manufacture.\r\nThe wines of southern Spain are brought by coasters from Barcelona and\r\nValencia. The inferior Bordeaux growths come pouring from the Garonne by\r\nthe Canal du Midi; and the hot and fiery Rhone wines are floated along\r\nthe chain of etangs and canals from Beaucaire. With all these raw\r\nmaterials, and, of course, a chemical laboratory to boot, it would be\r\nhard if the clever folks of Cette could not turn out a very good\r\nimitation of any wine in demand. They will doctor you up bad Bordeaux\r\nwith violet powders and rough cider--colour it with cochineal and\r\nturnsole, and outswear creation that it is precious Chateau\r\nMargaux--vintage of '25. Champagne, of course, they make by hogsheads.\r\nDo you wish sweet liqueur wines from Italy and the Levant? The Cette\r\npeople will mingle old Rhone wines with boiled sweet wines from the\r\nneighbourhood of Lunel, and charge you any price per bottle. Do you wish\r\nto make new Claret old? A Cette manufacturer will place it in his oven,\r\nand, after twenty-fours' regulated application of heat, return it to you\r\nnine years in bottle. Port, Sherry, and Madeira, of course, are\r\nfabricated in abundance with any sort of bad, cheap wine and brandy, for\r\na stock, and with half the concoctions in a druggist's shop for\r\nseasoning. Cette, in fact, is the very capital and emporium of the\r\ntricks and rascalities of the wine-trade; and it supplies almost all the\r\nBrazils, and a great proportion of the northern European nations with\r\ntheir after-dinner drinks. To the grateful Yankees it sends out\r\nthousands of tons of Ay and Moet, besides no end of Johannisberg,\r\nHermitage, and Chateau Margaux, the fine qualities and dainty aroma of\r\nwhich are highly prized by the transatlantic amateurs. The Dutch flag\r\nfluttered plentifully in the harbour, so that I presume Mynheer is a\r\ncustomer to the Cette industrials--or, at all events, he helps in the\r\ndistribution of their wares. The old French West Indian colonies also\r\npatronise their ingenious countrymen of Cette; and Russian magnates get\r\ndrunk on Chambertin and Romanee Conti, made of low Rhone, and low\r\nBurgundy brewages, eked out by the contents of the graduated phial. I\r\nfear, however, that we do come in--in the matter of \"fine golden\r\nSherries, at 22_s._ 9-1/2_d._ a dozen,\" or \"peculiar old-crusted Port,\r\nat 1_s._ 9_d._\"--for a share of the Cette manufactures; and it is very\r\nprobable that after the wine is fabricated upon the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, it is still further improved upon the banks of the\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nAt dinner-time, I found myself placed by the side of a\r\nbenevolent-looking old priest, with white hair, but cheeks and gills of\r\nthe most approved rubicund hue, who first eyed the dishes through a pair\r\nof vast golden spectacles, and meditated profoundly ere he made a\r\nchoice--waving away the eternal _bouilli_ with an expression which\r\nshowed that he was not the man to spoil a good appetite with mere boiled\r\nbeef. This worthy, hearing me making interest with the waiter for a\r\npeculiar bottle of wine, not of native manufacture, smiled paternally,\r\nand with an approving countenance: \"I would recommend,\" he said, softly,\r\nand in a fat voice, \"you to try Masdeu; and, if you please, I will join\r\nyou. I know Gilliaume (the waiter) of old. _C'est un bon enfant._\" And\r\nthen, in a severe voice, \"_The_ Masdeu, William.\"\r\n\r\nThe priest was clearly at home; and presently the wine came. It had the\r\nbrightly deep glow of Burgundy, a bouquet not unlike Claret, and tasted\r\nlike the lightest and purest Port glorified and etherealised; in fact,\r\nit was a rare good wine.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the priest, pouring out a second glass; \"the vineyard where\r\nthis was grown once belonged to the Church. The Knights of the Temple\r\nonce drank this wine, and the Knights of St. John after them. It is a\r\ngood wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Church understood the grape,\" I remarked. \"I have drunk Hermitage\r\nwhere the recluse fathers tended the vines, and have always looked upon\r\nRhone wine as one of the reasons why the Holy Father at Avignon was long\r\nso loath to be the Holy Father at Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wine,\" replied my compotator, \"is not forbidden, either by the laws of\r\nGod or the Church; and never was. Only the Vulgate denounces mixed\r\nwines.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the mixed wines prohibited in Holy Writ,\" said I, \"I presume you\r\nunderstand adulterated, not watered liquors. If so, we are in a sad city\r\nof sinners.\"\r\n\r\nThe priest smiled, but changed the topic.\r\n\r\n\"Masdeu,\" he said, \"is Catalan; you know the wine is grown not far from\r\nPerpignan, where the people are half Spanish. Do you know the meaning of\r\nMasdeu? It is a very old name for the vineyard, and it signifies 'God's\r\nfield.'\"\r\n\r\nI thought of the difference of national character between the French and\r\nthe Germans--\"God's field\" in France, a vineyard; \"God's field\" in\r\nGermany, a churchyard.\r\n\r\n\"The ancient Romans,\" continued my friend, \"liked the wines, the sweet\r\nwines of this country, better than any other growths in Gaul.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Romans,\" I said, \"had a most swinish taste in wines, and dishes\r\ntoo. The Falernian was boiled syrup, cooked up with drugs, and tempered\r\nwith salt water. Only think of mixing brine with your tipple; or of\r\nplacing it in a _fumarium_, to imbibe the flavour of the smoke! The\r\nRomans were mere liqueur drinkers. Aniseed, or maraschino, or parfait\r\namour, or any trash of that kind, would have suited them better than\r\ngenuine, fine-flavoured wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pourtant_;\" said my friend; \"you go too far; maraschino and parfait\r\namour are not trash. Although I agree with you, that the palate which\r\neternally appeals for sweets is in a morbid condition. But the Romans,\r\nafter all, must have had tongues of peculiar nicety for some savours. A\r\nRoman epicure could tell, by the relative tenderness, the leg upon which\r\na partridge had been in the habit of sitting at night, and whether a\r\ncarp had been caught above or below a certain bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or was it not,\" I asked, with hazy reminiscences of Juvenal floating\r\nabout me,--\"was it not a certain sewer--the Cloaca Maxima, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only,\" argued the priest in continuation, \"I could never understand\r\ntheir fondness for lampreys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said I, \"it is because you never tasted them after they had\r\nbeen fattened on slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is,\" replied the good man, musing.\r\n\r\nBy this time dinner was over, and the guests gone. We had the remains of\r\nthe dessert, the pick-tooths, and another bottle of the Catalan wine to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"You French,\" I ventured, \"hardly seem worthy of your fine wines. You\r\nnever appear to care about them; you seldom sit a moment after dinner to\r\nenjoy them; and if you relish anything more than another, it is\r\nChampagne, which, after all, is but a baby taste. All your very best\r\nwine goes to England; most of your second-class growths to Russia; and\r\nyour lower sorts to the northern nations on the Baltic. I don't think\r\nthere is anything like a generally cultivated taste for good wine in\r\nFrance, and yet you are supreme in the _cuisine_.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the _fermiers generaux_, and the _financiers_,\" replied the\r\npriest, \"who made French cookery what it is. They tried to outshine the\r\nold noblesse at table; they revived truffles, and they had the first\r\ndishes of green pease, at eight hundred francs a _plat_. Next to the\r\nfinanciers were the chevaliers and the abbés. _Oh, mon Dieu! qu'ils\r\nétaient gourmands ces chers amis_; the chevaliers all swagger and dash;\r\nthe sword right up and down--shoulder-knot flaunting--a bold bearing and\r\na keen eye. The abbés, in velvet and silk--as fat as carps, as sleek as\r\nmoles, and as soft-footed as cats--little and sly--perfect enjoyers of\r\nthe gourmandise. Oh, there was nothing more snug than an _abbé\r\ncommanditaire_! He had consideration, position, money; no one to please,\r\nand nothing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"These were the good old times,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"_Ma foi!_\" replied the clerical dignitary; \"they were bad times for\r\nFrance in general; but they were rare times for the few who lived upon\r\nit. There were Frenchmen, at any rate, then, who understood wine; at\r\nleast, they drunk enough of it to understand the science, from the alpha\r\nto the omega.\"\r\n\r\nWe parted, after a proper degree of hand-shaking; and a quarter of an\r\nhour afterwards I was rattling along the Montpellier and Cette railway,\r\nwith a ticket for Lunel in my pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT THE OLIVE-TREE--THE GATHERING OF THE OLIVES--LUNEL--A\r\nNIGHT WITH A SCORE OF MOSQUITOES--AIGUES-MORTES--THE DEAD\r\nLANDSCAPE--THE MARSH FEVER--A STRANGE CICERONE--THE LAST\r\nCRUSADING KING--THE SALTED BURGUNDIANS--THE POISONED\r\nCAMISARDS--THE MEDITERRANEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing, for the present, Montpellier, where people with consumptions\r\nused to be sent to swallow dust, as likely to be soothing to the lungs,\r\nand to breathe the balmy zephyrs of the whispering mistral, I made\r\nstraight for Lunel, in order to get from thence to one of the strangest\r\nold towns in France--Aigues-Mortes. All around us, as we hurried on,\r\nwere vines and olives--a true land of wine and oil. The olive-tree did\r\nnot improve on acquaintance--it got uglier and uglier--more formal, and\r\nmore cast-iron looking, the more you saw of it. And then it was\r\ninvariably planted in rows, at regular intervals, so as to give the\r\nnotion of a prim old garden--never of a wood. Like all fruit-trees in\r\nFrance, the olive is most carefully trimmed, and clipped, and tortured,\r\nand twisted into the most approved or fashionable shape. The man who can\r\nmake his _oliviers_ look most like umbrellas is the great cultivator;\r\nand the services of the peasants who have got a reputation for olive\r\ndressing are better paid than those of any agricultural labourers in\r\nFrance. They are eternally snipping and slashing, and turning and\r\ntwisting the tree, until the unfortunate specimens have had any small\r\ndegree of natural ease and harmony which they possessed assiduously\r\nwrenched out of them. And yet there are people in the South of France\r\nwho are enthusiastic on the hidden beauty of the olive. There are\r\ntechnical terms for all the particular spreads and contortions given to\r\nthe branches; and the olive amateur will hold forth to you by the hour\r\nupon the subtle charms of each. A gentleman from beyond Marseilles has\r\ndilated with rapture to me on his delight, after a residence in\r\nNormandy, in returning again to the hot South, and revisiting the dear\r\nolives, so prim, and orderly, and symmetrical--not like the huge,\r\nstraggling, sprawling oaks and elms of the North, growing up in utter\r\ndefiance of all rule and system.\r\n\r\nThe olives of France, this gentleman informed me, are very inferior to\r\nthe trees of a couple of generations ago. Towards the close of the last\r\ncentury, there was a winter night of intense frost; and when the morning\r\nbroke, the trees were nearly smitten to the core. That year there was\r\nnot an olive gathered in Provence or Languedoc. The next season, some of\r\nthe stronger and younger trees partially revived, and slips were planted\r\nfrom those to which the axe had been applied; but the entire species of\r\nthe tree, he assured me, had fallen off--had dwindled, and pined, and\r\nbecome stunted; and the profits of olive cultivation had faded with it.\r\nThe gentleman spoke on the subject with a degree of unction which would\r\nhave suited the fall, not of the olive, but of man. It was a catastrophe\r\nwhich coloured his whole life. He was himself an olive proprietor; and\r\nvery likely his fortunes fell on the fatal night as many points as the\r\nthermometer. On our way to Lunel we saw the olive-gathering just\r\nbeginning; but, alas! it had none of the gaiety and bright associations\r\nof the vintage. On the contrary, it was as business-like and unexciting\r\nas weeding onions, or digging potatoes. A set of ragged peasants--the\r\ncountry people hereabouts are poorly dressed--were clambering barefoot\r\nin the trees, each man with a basket tied before him, and lazily\r\nplucking the dull oily fruit. Occasionally, the olive-gatherers had\r\nspread a white cloth beneath the tree, and were shaking the very ripe\r\nfruit down; but there was neither jollity nor romance about the process.\r\nThe olive is a tree of association, but that is all. Its culture, its\r\nmanuring, and clipping, and trimming, and grafting--the gathering of its\r\nfruits, and their squeezing in the mill, when the ponderous stone goes\r\nround and round in the glutinous trough, crushing the very essence out\r\nof the oily pulps--while the fat, oleaginous stream pours lazily into\r\nthe greasy vessels set to receive it;--all this is as prosaic and\r\nuninteresting as if the whole Royal Agricultural Society were presiding\r\nin spirit over the operations. And, after all, what could be expected?\r\n\"Grapes,\" said a clever Frenchman, \"are wine-pills\"--the notion of\r\nconviviality and mirth is ever attached to them; and the vintagers, when\r\nstripping the loaded branches, have their minds involuntarily carried\r\nforward to the joyous ultimate results of their labours. But who--our\r\nfriends the Russians, and their cousins the Esquimaux excepted--could\r\npossibly be jolly over the idea of oil? It may act balsamically and\r\nsoothingly; and the idea of the olive saucer, green amongst the bright\r\ndecanters, does approach, in some respect, towards the production of a\r\npleasant association of ideas; but still the elevated and poetic\r\nfeelings connected with the tree are remote and dim.\r\n\r\nIt was Minerva's tree. When the gods assembled to decide the dispute\r\nbetween Pallas and Neptune, as to which should baptize the rising\r\nAthens, it was determined that the honour should belong to whichever of\r\nthe twain presented the greatest gift to man. Neptune struck the earth,\r\nand a horse sprung to day. Minerva waved her hand, and the olive-tree\r\ngrew up before the conclave. The goddess won the day, inasmuch as the\r\nsapient assemblage decided that the olive, as an emblem of peace, was\r\nbetter than the horse, as an emblem of war. Now, I would put this\r\nquestion to Olympus:--How could the olive or the horse be emblems before\r\nthey were created? And, even if they were emblems, was not the point at\r\nissue the best gift--not the best allegorical symbol? I beg, therefore,\r\nto assure Neptune that I consider him to have been an ill-used\r\nindividual, and to express a hope that, if he should ever again come\r\ninto power, he will not forget my having paid my respects to him in his\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\nI do not know if I have anything particular to record respecting Lunel,\r\nwhich is a quiet, stupid, shadowy place, but that I passed the night\r\nengaged in mortal combat with a predatory band of mosquitoes. I was\r\nwarned, before going to bed, to take care how I managed the operation,\r\nand to whip myself through the gauze curtains so as to allow nothing to\r\nenter _en suite_. The bed--I don't know why--had been placed in the\r\nmiddle of the room, and the filmy net curtains, like fairy drapery, were\r\nsnugly tucked in beneath the bedding. Looking at them more particularly,\r\nI distinguished a little card, accidentally left adhering to the net,\r\nwhich informed me that it was the fabrication of those wondrous\r\nlace-machines of Nottingham; and I trusted that as Britannia rules the\r\nwaves, she would also baffle the mosquitoes. Perhaps it was my own fault\r\nthat she did not. I remembered Captain Basil Hall's admirable\r\ndescription of doing the wretched insects in question by leaping\r\nsuddenly into bed, like harlequin through a clock-dial, and frantically\r\nclosing up the momentary opening, and I performed the feat in question\r\nwith as much agility as I could. But what has befallen the gallant\r\ncaptain, also on that night befell me. Mosquitoes shoot into a bed like\r\nthe Whigs into office--through the most infinitesimal crevices--but with\r\nthe entrance the resemblance ceases--once in office, with the country\r\nsleeping tolerably comfortably, the Whigs do nothing. Not so, the\r\nmosquitoes. Their policy is perfectly different, and their energies\r\nvastly greater. For a true sketch of the style of mosquito\r\nadministration, I must again refer to Hall. His picture is true--true to\r\na bite, to a scratch, to a hum. I might paint it again, but any one can\r\nsee the original. So I content myself with simply stating that from\r\neleven o'clock, P.M., till an unknown hour next morning, I was leaping\r\nup and down the bed, striking myself furious blows all over, but never,\r\napparently, hitting my blood-thirsty enemies, and only now and then\r\noccasionally sinking into a momentary doze to be roused by that loud,\r\nclear trumpet of war--the very music of spite and pique and greediness\r\nof blood, circling round and round in the darkness, and ever coming\r\nnearer and nearer, till at last it ceased, and then came--the bite, as\r\nregularly as the applause after the cavatina of a prima donna. I made my\r\nappearance next morning, looking exactly as if I had been attacked in\r\nthe night by measles, the mumps, swollen face, and erysipelas.\r\n\r\nBetween Aigues-Mortes and Lunel, there is no public vehicle, because\r\nthere is no travelling public; and so I hired a ricketty, shandry-dan\r\nlooking affair, to take me on; and away we started, under a perfect\r\nblaze of hot, sickly sunshine. The road ran due south, through the\r\nvineyards and olives, but they gradually faded away as the soil got more\r\nand more spongy, and presently we saw before us a waste of the same sort\r\nas that which I have described on approaching the sea by the Canal du\r\nMidi. Shallow pools, salt marshes, and bulrush jungles, lay flat and\r\nsilent, glaring in the sunshine--the watchful crane, the sole living\r\ncreature to be seen amid these desolate swamps. It struck me that John\r\nBunyan, had he ever seen a landscape like this strange, stagnant expanse\r\nof dreariness, would have made grand use of it in that great prose poem\r\nof his. Perhaps he would have called it \"Dead Corpse Land,\" or the\r\nSlough--not of Despond, but of Despair. Presently we found the road\r\nrunning upon a raised embankment, with two great lakes, spotted with\r\nrushy islands on either hand, and before us a grim, grey tower, with an\r\nancient gateway--the gates or portcullis long since removed, but a\r\nGothic arch still spanning the roughly-paved causeway. As we rattled\r\nbeneath it, two or three lounging _douaniers_ came forth, and looked\r\nlazily at us; and presently we saw the grey walls of Aigues-Mortes\r\nrising, massive and square, above the level lines of the marshes,\r\nfronted by one lone minaret, called the \"Tower of Constance\"--a gloomy\r\nsteeple-prison, where, in the time of the Camisards, a crowd of women\r\nwere confined--the wives and daughters of the brave Protestants of the\r\nCevennes, who fought their country inch by inch against the dragoons of\r\nLouis Quatorze, and who--the prisoners, I mean--were forced to swallow\r\npoison by the agents of that right royal and religious king, the pious\r\nhero and Champion of the Faith, as it is in the Vatican. Outside the\r\ntown looks like a mere fortification--you see nothing but the sweep of\r\nthe massive walls reflected in the stagnant waters which lie dead around\r\nthem. Not a house-top appears above the ramparts. It is only by the thin\r\nswirlings of the wood-fire smoke that you know that human life exists\r\nbehind that blank and dreary veil of stone. We entered by a deep Gothic\r\narch, and found ourselves in narrow, gloomy, silent streets, the houses\r\ngrey and ghastly, and many ruinous and deserted. The rotten remnants of\r\nthe green _jalousies_ were mouldering week by week away, and moss and\r\nlichens were creeping up the walls; many roofs had fallen, and of some\r\nhouses only fragments of wall remained. The next moment we were\r\ntraversing an open space, strewn with rubbish of stone, brick, and\r\nrotten wood, with patches of dismal garden-ground interspersed, and all\r\nround the dim, grey, silent houses, dismal and dead. Aigues-Mortes\r\ncould, and once did, hold about ten thousand people. It was a city built\r\nin whim by a king, the last of the royal crusaders, Louis IX. of France.\r\nBy him and his immediate descendants, it was esteemed a holy place--the\r\ncrusading port. The walls built round it, and which still remain--as the\r\nempty armour, after the knight who once filled it is dead and gone--were\r\nerected in imitation of those of the Egyptian town of Damietta, and all\r\nsorts of privileges were granted to the inhabitants. But one privilege\r\nthe old kings of France could not grant: they could not, by any amount\r\nof letters patent, or any seize of seals, confer immunity from fever;\r\nand Aigues-Mortes has been dying of ague ever since it was founded. In\r\nits early times, the influence of royal favour struggled long and well\r\nagainst disease: one man down, another came on. What loyal Frenchman\r\nwould refuse to go from hot fits to cold fits of fever, for a certain\r\nnumber of months, and then to his long home, if it were to pleasure a\r\ndescendant of St. Louis? But the time and the influences of the Holy\r\nWars went by, and the kings of France withdrew their smiles from\r\nAigues-Mortes; so that their royal brother, King Death, had it all his\r\nown way. Funerals far outnumbered births or weddings, and gradually the\r\nlife faded and faded from the stone-girt town, as the ebbing tide leaves\r\na pier. Cette gave it the finishing stroke. A crowd of the inhabitants\r\nemigrated _en masse_ to Riquet's city; and here now is\r\nAigues-Mortes--coffin-like Aigues-Mortes--with about a couple of\r\nthousand pallid, shaking mortals, striving their best against the marsh\r\nfever, among the ruined houses and within the smouldering walls of this\r\nancient Gothic city.\r\n\r\nIn a solemn, shady street, I found a decentish hotel, not much above the\r\nrank of an auberge, and where I was about as lonely as in the vast\r\ncaravansary at Bagnerre. The landlord himself--a staid, decent\r\nman--waited at my solitary dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, \"is an artist, or a poet?\"\r\n\r\n\"What made him think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because nobody else ever came to Aigues-Mortes--no traveller ever\r\nturned aside across the marshes, to visit their poor old decayed town.\r\nThere was no trade, no _commis voyageurs_. The people of Nismes and\r\nMontpellier were afraid of the fever; and even if they were not, why\r\nshould they come there? It was no place for pleasure on a holiday--a man\r\nwould as soon think of amusing himself in a hospital or a morgue, as in\r\nAigues-Mortes.\"\r\n\r\nI inquired more particularly about the fever, for I felt it difficult to\r\nconceive how people could continue to remain in a place cursed by nature\r\nwith a perpetual chronic plague. My host informed me that those who\r\nlived well and copiously, were well clothed, well lodged, and under no\r\nnecessity to be out early and late among the marshes, fared tolerably.\r\nThey might have an ague-fit now and then, but when once well-seasoned\r\nthey did pretty well. It was the poorer class who suffered, particularly\r\nin spring and autumn, when vegetation was forming and withering, and\r\nthe steaming mists came out thickest over the fens. People seldom died\r\nwith the first attack; but the subtle disease hung about them, and\r\nreturned again and again, and wore, and tugged, and exhausted their\r\nenergies--kept nibbling, in fact, at body and soul, till, in too many\r\ncases, the disease-besieged man surrendered, and his soul marched out. I\r\nasked again, then, how the poor people remained in such a hot-bed of\r\npestilence? \"_Que voulez vous_,\" was the reply--\"the greater part can't\r\nhelp it; they were born here, and they have a place here;--at Nismes, or\r\nMarseilles, or Montpellier, they would have no place. Besides, they are\r\naccustomed to it; they look upon fevers as one of the conditions of\r\ntheir lives, like eating and drinking; and, besides, they have no energy\r\nfor a change. The stuff has been taken out of them; you will see what a\r\nsallow, worn-out people we have at Aigues-Mortes. They can get a living\r\nhere, but they would be overwhelmed anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nThe landlord had previously recommended a _cicerone_ to me, assuring me\r\nthat I would not find him an ordinary man, that he was a sort of\r\nhalf-gentleman, and a scholar, and that he knew everything about\r\nAigues-Mortes better than anybody else in it. Accordingly, I was\r\npresently introduced to M. Auguste Saint Jean, an old, very thin man,\r\ndressed in rusty black, and wearing--hear it, ye degenerate\r\ndays!--powdered hair and a queue. M. Saint Jean looked like a\r\nbroken-down schoolmaster, some touches of pedantry still giving\r\nformality to the humble sliding gait, and bent, bowing form. His face\r\nwas nearly as wrinkled as Voltaire's, but he had black eyes which\r\ngleamed like a ferret's when you show him a rabbit.\r\n\r\nIn company with this old gentleman I passed a wandering day in and round\r\nAigues-Mortes, rambling from gate to gate, scrambling up broken stairs\r\nto the battlements, and threading our way amid dim lanes, half choked up\r\nwith rubbish, from one ghastly old tower to another. All this while my\r\nguide's tongue was eloquent. He gesticulated like the most fiercely\r\nfidgetty member of young France, and the ferret's eye gleamed as though\r\nupon a whole warren of rabbits. Aigues-Mortes seemed his one great\r\nsubject, his one passion, his own idea. Aigues-Mortes was the bride of\r\nhis enthusiasm, the soul of his body. He had been born in Aigues-Mortes;\r\nhe had lived in it; he had the fever in it; and he hoped to die in\r\nit, and be buried among the stilly marshes. How well he knew every\r\ncrumbling stone, every little Gothic bartizan, every relic of an ancient\r\nchapel, every gloomy tower haunted by traditions, as it might be by\r\nghosts. His mind flew back every moment to the days of the splendid\r\nfounding of Aigues-Mortes--to the crusading host, whose glory crowded it\r\nwith armour, and banners, and cloth of gold, assembled round their king,\r\nSt. Louis, and bound for Palestine. On the seaward side of the walls,\r\nAuguste shewed me rings sunk in the stone, and to these rings, he said,\r\nthe galleys and caravels of the king had been fastened. The sea is about\r\ntwo miles and a half distant, but the traces of the canal which led to\r\nit are still visible amid the marsh and sand, so that, right beneath the\r\nwalls, upon the smooth, unmoving _aguæ mortes_--whence, of course,\r\nAigues-Mortes--floated the fleet of the Crusade, made fast to the\r\nramparts of the fortress of the Crusade. And so Saint Louis sailed with\r\na thousand ships, standing proudly upon the poop, while the bishops\r\nround him raised loud Latin chants, and the warriors clashed their\r\nharness. The king wore the pilgrim's scrip and the pilgrim's shell. Long\r\nand earnestly did my _cicerone_ dilate upon the evil fortunes of the\r\nCrusade--how, indeed, in the beginning it seemed to prosper, and how\r\nDamietta was stormed;--but the Saracens had their turn, and the King of\r\nFrance, and many of his best paladins were soon prisoners in the Paynim\r\ntents. Question of their ransom being raised, \"A king of France,\" said\r\nLouis, \"is not bought or sold with money. Take a city--a city for a king\r\nof France.\" The sentence and the sentiment are picturesque; but, after\r\nall, there is not much in one or the other. However, the followers of\r\nMahound agreed. Louis was restored to France, and Damietta to its former\r\nowners; the rest of the European prisoners being thrown into the bargain\r\nfor eight thousand gold bezants. Saint Louis, however, was too holy and\r\ntoo restless a personage to remain long at home, so that Aigues-Mortes\r\nsoon saw him again; and this time he departed waving above his head the\r\ncrown of thorns. The infidels had laid hands on him the first time, but\r\na fiercer enemy now grappled with the king--the plague clutched him; and\r\nthough a monarch of France could not be bought or sold for any number of\r\ngold bezants, the plague had him cheap--in fact, for an old song. \"He\r\ndied,\" says that bold writer, M. Alexandre Dumas, who spins you off the\r\nmost interesting history, all out of his own head--\"he died on a bed of\r\nashes, on the very spot where the messenger of Rome found Marius sitting\r\non the ruins of Carthage\"--an interesting topographical fact, seeing\r\nthat nobody, now-a-days, knows where Carthage stood at all--always\r\nsaving and excepting M. Alexandre Dumas.\r\n\r\nWe stood before a grey, massive tower--a Gothic finger of mouldering\r\nstone. \"Louis de Malagne,\" said my old _cicerone_, \"a traitorous\r\nFrenchman, delivered these holy walls to our enemies of Burgundy, and a\r\ngarrison of the Duke's held possession of the sacred city of\r\nAigues-Mortes. But the sacrilege was fearfully avenged. The oriflamme\r\nwas spread by the forces of the king, and the townspeople rose within\r\nthe walls, and, step by step, the foreign garrison were driven back till\r\nthey fought in a ring round this old tower. They fought well, and died\r\nhard, but they did die--every man--always round this old tower. So, when\r\nthe question came to be, where to fling the corpses, a citizen said,\r\n'This is a town of salt; salt is the harvest of Aigues-Mortes--let us\r\nsalt the Burgundians.' And another said, 'Truly, there is a cask ready\r\nfor the meat;' and he pointed to the tower. Then they laid the dead men\r\nstark and stiff, as though to floor the tower. Then they heaped salt on\r\nthem, a layer two feet thick; then they put on another stratum of\r\nBurgundian flesh, and another stratum of salt--till the tower was as a\r\ncask--choke-full--bursting-full of pickled Burgundians.\"\r\n\r\nMuch more he told me of the early fortunes of the Place--how here\r\nFrancis I. met his enemy, Charles V., in solemn conference, each\r\nmonarch utterly disbelieving every sacred word uttered by the other; and\r\nhow the celebrated Algerine pirate, Barbarossa, who was the very\r\npatriarch of buccaneers--the Abraham of the Mansveldts, and Morgans, and\r\nDampiers, and who invented, and emblazoned upon his flags the famous\r\nmotto, \"The Friend of the Sea, and the Enemy of All who sail upon\r\nit\"--how this red-bearded rover once cast anchor off the port, and by\r\nway of notifying to France that their ally against the Spaniard had\r\narrived, set fire to a wood of Italian pine on the margin of the\r\nmarshes, and lighted up the whole country by the lurid blaze. Of the\r\nCamisards, of whom I was more anxious to hear--of the poisoning in the\r\ntower of St. Constance, and of the band of braves who descended from the\r\nsummit upon tattered strips of blankets--he knew comparatively little.\r\nHis mind was mediæval. Aigues-Mortes in the day of Louis Quatorze, was a\r\ndeclining place. The glory had gone out of it, and the unappeasable\r\nfever was slowly, but surely, claiming its own. Indeed, for a century it\r\nhad been master. Aigues-Mortes will probably vanish like Gatton and Old\r\nSarum. A pile of ruins, girdled in by crumbling walls, will slowly be\r\ninvaded by the sleeping waters of the marsh; and the heron, and the\r\nduck, and the meek-eyed gull wandering from the sea, will alone flit\r\nrestlessly over the city built by Louis the Saint, walled by Philip the\r\nBold, and blessed by one of the wisest and the holiest of the Popes.\r\n\r\nReboul, the Nismes poet--I called upon him, but he was from home--is a\r\nbaker, and lives by selling rolls, as Jasmin is a barber, and lives by\r\nscraping chins. Reboul is, like M. Auguste Saint Jean, an enthusiastic\r\nlover of the poor, dying, fever-struck Gothic town. Let me translate, as\r\nwell as I may, half-a-dozen couplets in which he characterises the dear\r\ncity of the Crusades. The poetry is not unlike Victor Hugo's--stern,\r\nrich, fanciful, and coloured, like an old cathedral window.\r\n\r\n    \"See, from the stilly waters, and above the sleepy swamp,\r\n    Where, steaming up, the fever-fog rolls grim, and grey, and damp:\r\n\r\n    How the holy, royal city--Aigues-Mortes, that silent town,\r\n    Looms like the ghost of Greatness, and of Pride that's been pulled\r\n      down.\r\n\r\n    See how its twenty silent towers, with nothing to defend,\r\n    Stand up like ancient coffins, all grimly set on end;\r\n\r\n    With ruins all around them, for, sleeping and at rest,\r\n    Lies the life of that old city, like a dead owl in its nest--\r\n\r\n    Like the shrunken, sodden body, so ghastly and so pale,\r\n    Of a warrior who has died, and who has rotted in his mail--\r\n\r\n    Like the grimly-twisted corpse of a nun within her pall,\r\n    Whom they bound, and gagged, and built, all living, in a wall.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the town, we partially floated, in a boat, and partially toiled\r\nthrough swamp and sand to the sea--Auguste constantly preaching on the\r\nantiquarian topography of the place, upon old canals, and middle-aged\r\ncanals--one obliterating the other; on the route which the galleys of\r\nSt. Louis followed from the walls to the ocean; on a dreary spot between\r\nsand-hills, which he called _les Tombeaux_, and where, by his account,\r\nthe Crusaders who died before the starting of the expedition lie buried\r\nin their armour of proof. Then we toiled to a little harbour--a mere\r\nfisherman's creek--where it is supposed the ancient canal of St. Louis\r\njoined the sea, and which still bears the name of the _Grau Louis_, or\r\nthe _Grau de Roi_--\"grau\" being understood to be a corruption of\r\n_gradus_. At this spot, rising in the midst of a group of clustered\r\nhuts, the dwellings of fishermen and aged _douaniers_, one or\r\ntwo of whom were lazily angling off the piers--their chief\r\noccupation--there stands a lighthouse, about forty feet high.\r\n\r\n\"Let us climb to the lantern,\" said Auguste, \"and you will then see our\r\nsilent land, and our poor dear old fading town lying at our feet.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly up we went; only poor Auguste stopped every three steps to\r\ncough; and before we had got half way, the perspiration came streaming\r\ndown his yellow face, proving what might have been a matter of dispute\r\nbefore--that he had some moisture somewhere in his body. From the top we\r\nboth gazed earnestly, and I curiously, around. On one side, the sea,\r\nblue--purple blue; on the other side, something which was neither sea\r\nnor land--water and swamp--pond and marsh--bulrush thickets, and\r\ntamarisk jungles, shooting in peninsular capes, points, and headlands,\r\ninto the salt sea lakes; in the centre of them--like the ark grounding\r\nafter the deluge--the grey walls of Aigues-Mortes. Between the great\r\n_mare internum_ and the lagoons, rolling sand-hills--the barrier-line of\r\nthe coast--and upon them, but afar off, moving specks--the semi-wild\r\ncattle of the country; white dots--the Arab-blooded horses which are\r\nused for flails; black dots--the wild bulls and cows, which the mounted\r\nherdsmen drive with couched lance and flying lasso.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not beautiful?\" murmured Auguste; \"I think it so. I was born\r\nhere. I love this landscape--it is so grand in its flatness; the shore\r\nis as grand as the sea. Look, there are distant hills\"--pointing to the\r\nshadowy outline of the Cevennes--\"but the hills are not so glorious as\r\nthe plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But neither have they the fever of the plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is God's will. But, fever or no fever, I love this land--so quiet,\r\nand still, and solemn--ay, monsieur, as solemn as the deserts of the\r\nArabs, or as a cathedral at midnight--as solemn, and as strange, and as\r\nawful, as the early world, fresh from the making, with the birds flying,\r\nand the fish swimming, on the evening of the fifth day, before the Lord\r\ncreated Adam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nFLAT MARSH SCENERY, TREATED BY POETS AND PAINTERS--TAVERN\r\nALLEGORIES--NISMES--THE AMPHITHEATRE AND THE MAISON\r\nCARRÉE--PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC--THE OLD RELIGIOUS WARS ALIVE\r\nSTILL--THE SILK WEAVER OF NISMES AND THE DRAGONNÆDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Launcelot Gobbo had an infection to serve Bassanio, so I somehow took\r\nill with an infection to walk, instead of ride, back to Lunel. I suppose\r\nthat Auguste had innoculated me, in some measure, with his mysterious\r\nlove for the boundless swamps and primeval jungles of bulrush around; so\r\nthat I felt a sort of pang in leaving them, and would willingly depart\r\nlingeringly and alone. Sending on my small baggage, then, by _roulage_,\r\nI strode forth out of the dead city, and was soon pacing alone the\r\nechoing causeway, like an Arab steering by the sun in the desert. There\r\nis one dead and one living English poet who would have made glorious use\r\nof this fen landscape, so repulsive to many, but which did, after all,\r\npossess a strange, undefinable attraction for me. The dead poet is\r\nShelley, who had the true eye for sublimity in waste. Take the following\r\npicture-touch:--\r\n\r\n                        \"An uninhabited sea-side,\r\n    Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,\r\n    Abandons; and no other object breaks\r\n    The waste, but one dwarf tree, and some few stakes,\r\n    Broken and unrepaired; and the tide makes\r\n    A narrow space of level sand thereon.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of landscape, too, which, in another department of art,\r\nCollins delighted in representing. But Shelley's picture of the\r\nluxuriant rush and water-plant vegetation would have been magnificent.\r\nListen how he handles a theme of the kind:\r\n\r\n    \"And plants, at whose names the verse feels loath,\r\n    Filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth--\r\n    Prickly and pulpous, and blistering and blue,\r\n    Livid and starred with a lurid dew;\r\n    Spawn-weeds, and filth, and leporous scum,\r\n    Made the running rivulet thick and dumb;\r\n    And at its outlet, flags huge as stakes\r\n    Dammed it up with roots knotted like water-snakes.\"\r\n\r\nTennyson is the living poet who would picture with equal effect the\r\nregion of swamp, and rush, and pool. Brought up in a fen district, his\r\neye and feeling for marsh scenery and vegetation are perfect. Remember\r\nthe marish mosses in the rotting fosse which encircled the \"Moated\r\nGrange.\" Musing thus of the Poet Laureate, I would assign to this\r\nlandscape embodiment of King Death, I passed the half-way tower, where\r\nthree _douaniers_, seated in chairs, were fishing and looking as glum\r\nand silent as their prey, and began to discern the gravelly, shingly\r\nland of vines and olives again before me. The clear air of the South\r\ncheats us northerns like a mirage. You see objects as near you as in\r\nEngland they would be brought by a very fair spy-glass, and the effect,\r\nbefore you began to make allowances for the atmospheric spectacles, is\r\nto put you dreadfully out of humour at the length of the way, before you\r\nactually came up with the too distinct goal. So was it strongly with me\r\nin pedestrianising towards Lunel. Lunel seemed retreating back and back,\r\nso that my consolation became that it would be surely stopped by the\r\nCevennes, even if the worst came to the worst; and go where it would, I\r\nwas determined to come up with it somehow. Entering the region of the\r\nvine, the moppy olive, and the dust which was flying about in clouds, I\r\nhalted at a roadside auberge to wash the latter article out of my\r\nthroat, and reaped my reward in the sight of a splendid cartoon\r\nsuspended over the great fireplace, which represented, in a severe\r\nallegory, \"The Death of Credit killed by bad Payers.\" The scene was a\r\nhandsome street, with a great open _café_ behind, at the _comptoir_ of\r\nwhich sat Madam Commerce aghast at the atrocity being committed before\r\nher. In a corner are seen a group of _gardes de commerce_--in the\r\nvernacular, bailiffs--lamenting over their ruined occupation. I came to\r\nknow the profession of these gentlemen, from the fact that their style\r\nand titles were legibly imprinted across their waistcoats. In the\r\nforeground, the main catastrophe of the composition was proceeding.\r\nCredit, represented by a fat, good-natured-looking, elderly gentleman in\r\na blue greatcoat, was stretched supine upon the stones, while his three\r\nmurderers brandished their weapons above him. The delineation of the\r\nculprits was anything but flattering to the three classes of society\r\nwhich I took them to represent. The \"first murderer,\" as they say in\r\n_Macbeth_, was a soldier. His sabre was deep in poor Credit's side. The\r\nsecond criminal must have been a musician, for he has just hit Credit a\r\nsuperhuman blow on the head with a fiddle--not a very deadly weapon one\r\nwould suppose; while the third assassin, armed with a billiard cue,\r\nseemed to typify the idler portion of the community in general. Between\r\nthem, however, there could be no doubt that Credit had been fairly done\r\nto death--the grim intimation was there to stare all topers in the face.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, indeed, that all over rural France, in the places of public\r\nentertainment, poor M. Credit is in exceedingly bad odour. I have seen\r\ndozens of pictorial hints, conveying with more or less delicacy the\r\nmelancholy moral of that just described. Sometimes, however, the\r\nlandlord distrusts the pencil, puts no faith in allegory, and stern and\r\nprosaic--with a propensity to political economy--and giving rise to dark\r\nsuspicions of a tendency to the Manchester school, writes up in sturdy\r\nletters, grim and hopeless--\r\n\r\n     \"ARGENT COMPTANT.\"\r\n\r\nAt other times, cast in a more genial mould, he deviates into what may\r\nbe called didactic verse--containing, like the \"Penny Magazine\"--useful\r\nknowledge for the people, and hints poetically to his customers, the\r\nrule of the establishment--taking care, however, to intimate to their\r\nsusceptible feelings that generous social impulses, rather than sombre\r\ncommercial necessity, are at the bottom of the regulation. Thus it is\r\nnot uncommon to read the following pithy and not particularly rhythmical\r\ndistich:--\r\n\r\n    \"Pour mieux conserver ses amis,\r\n    Ici on ne fait pas de credit.\"\r\n\r\nAt last Lunel was fairly caught, and an hour of the rail brought me to\r\nNismes and to the Hotel de Luxembourg, running out at the windows with\r\nswarms of _commis voyageurs_, the greater number connected with the silk\r\ntrade. One of these worthies beside whom I was placed at dinner, told me\r\nthat he intended to go to London to the Exhibition, and that he had a\r\nvery snug plan for securing a competent guide, who would poke up all the\r\nlions; this guide to be a \"_Marin du port de Londres; car tenez ils sont\r\ndes galliards futés, les marins du port de Londres_.\" I had all the\r\ndifficulty in the world in making the intending excursionist aware of\r\nthe probable effects of hiring, as a west-end guide, the first sailor or\r\nwaterman he picked up at Wapping.\r\n\r\nThe great features of Nismes are, as every body knows, the features\r\nwhich the Romans left behind them. Provence and Languedoc were the\r\nregions of Gaul which the great masters of the world liked best,\r\nprobably because they were nearest home; and obscure as was the Roman\r\nNismes--for I believe that Nimauses lays claim to no historic dignity\r\nwhatever--it must still have been a populous and important place: the\r\nunmouldering masonry of the Roman builders proves it. I had never seen\r\nany Roman remains to speak of, and, to tell the truth, had never been\r\nable to work up any great enthusiasm about the fragments of the ancient\r\npeople which I had come across. I had bathed in all the Roman baths\r\nwherewith London abounds, but found no inspiration in the waters--I had\r\nstood on grassy mounds of earth, believed to have been Roman camps;\r\ntraced like the Antiquary, the _Ager_, with its corresponding\r\n_fossa_--marked the _porta sinistra_ and the _porta dextra_--and stood\r\nwhere some hook-nosed general had reclined in the _Pretorium_; but I\r\nagain confess that my imagination did not fly impulsively back, and bury\r\nitself among _patres conscripti_, togas, vestal virgins, lictors,\r\npatricians, equites, and plebeians.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, such mere vague traces and memorials as baths, bits of\r\npavement, and dusty holes, with smouldering brick-basements, which\r\npeople call \"Roman villas,\"--are not at all fitted, whatever would-be\r\nclassicists may pretend, to stir up the strong tide of enthusiastic\r\nassociation. These are but miserable odds and ends of fragments, from\r\nwhich you can no more leap to the dignity and the grandeur of the\r\nRomans, than you could argue, never having seen a man, from finding a\r\ncast-away tooth-pick, up to the appearance and nature of the invisible\r\nowner. But let us see a great specimen of a great Roman work, and then\r\nwe are in the right track. Any builder could have made you a bath--any\r\nsapper and miner could have traced you out a camp--any of the small\r\narchitects with whom we are infested could have knocked you up a\r\nvilla--but give us a characteristic bit of the great people who are dead\r\nand gone, and then we can, or, at all events, we will try, to take their\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThe amphitheatre or arena at Nismes rose on me like a stupendous\r\nspectre, and frowned me down. I was smote with the sight. The size\r\nappalled me: mightiness--vastness--massiveness were there together--a\r\ntrinity of stone, rising up, as it were, in the middle of my little\r\npreconceived and pet notions, and shivering and dispersing them, as the\r\nEnglish three-decker in the _Pilot_ came bowling into view, driving away\r\nthe fog in wreaths before her and around her. First I walked about the\r\ngreat stone skeleton; but though the symmetrical glory of the\r\narchitecture, its massive regularity, and what I would call soldier-like\r\nprecision of uniformity, kept urging my mind to look and admire; still\r\nthe impression of vastness was predominant, and all but drove out other\r\nthoughts. And yet it was not until I had entered, that impression\r\nreached its profoundest depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMPHITHEATRE AT NISMES.]\r\n\r\nAs I emerged from the vaulted and cavern-like corridor, through which a\r\ngarrulous old woman led me, into the blaze of keen sunshine, that fell\r\nupon a mighty wilderness of stone; and as instinctively I laid my hand\r\nupon the nearest ponderous block, the full and perfect idea of size and\r\npower closed on me. _Roma!--Antiqua Roma!_--had me in her grasp; and as\r\nI felt, I remembered that Eothen had described a similar sensation, as\r\nproduced by the bigness of the stones of the great pyramid. My old woman\r\nhaving, happily, left me, I was alone within that enormous gulf--that\r\ncrater of regularly rising stone. Round and round, in ridges where\r\nTitans might have sat and seen, megatheria combat mastadons, mounted up\r\nthe mighty steps of grey, dead stone--sometimes entire for the whole\r\nround--sometimes splintered and riven, but never worn, until your\r\neye--now stumbling, as it were, over rubbish-heaps--now striding from\r\nstone ledge to stone ledge--rested upon the broken and jagged rim, with\r\na hoary beard of plants and long dry weeds standing rigidly up between\r\nyou and the blue. I turned again to the details of the building--to the\r\nvastness of the blocks of stone, and to the perfect manipulation which\r\nhad placed them. If the Romans were great soldiers, they were as great\r\nmasons. They conquered the world in all pursuits in which enormous\r\nenergy and iron muscularity of mind could conquer. The universe of\r\nearth, and stone, and water was theirs. But they were not cloud\r\ncompellers. They had none of the great power over the essences of the\r\nbrain. Beauty was too subtle for them; and they only got it,\r\nincidentally, as an element--not a principle. The arena in which I stood\r\nwas sternly beautiful; but it was the beauty of a legion drawn up for\r\nbattle--iron to the backbone--iron to the teeth--the beauty of that\r\nrigid symmetric inflexibility which sat upon the bronze faces which,\r\nwhen Hannibal, encamped on Roman ground set up for sale, and grimly and\r\nunmovedly saw bought, at the common market rate, the patch of earth on\r\nwhich the Carthaginian lay entrenched.\r\n\r\nI remained in the amphitheatre for hours--now descending to the arena,\r\nwhere the men and beasts fought and tore each other--now scrambling to\r\nthe highest ridge, and watching, with a calmness which soothed and\r\nlulled the mind, the vast bowl which lay beneath--so massive, so silent,\r\nand so grey. You can still trace the two posts of honour--the royal\r\nboxes, as it were--low down in the ring, and marked out by stone\r\nbarriers from the general sweep. Each of them has an exclusive corridor\r\nsunk in the massive stone; and behind each are vaulted cells, which you\r\nwill be told were used as guard-houses by the escort of soldiers or\r\nlictors. Tradition assigns one of these boxes to the proconsul--the\r\nother to the vestal virgins; but the latter, if I remember my Roman\r\nantiquities aright, could have no business out of Rome. There were no\r\nsubsidiary sacred fire-branch establishments, like provincial banks, to\r\npromulgate the credit of the \"central office,\"--kindled in the remote\r\npart of the empire. The holy flame burnt only before the mystic\r\npalladium, which answered for the security of Rome. Whoever occupied the\r\nboxes in question, however, were no doubt what one of Captain Marryatt's\r\ncharacters describes the Smith family to be in London--\"quite the\r\ntopping people of the place;\" and up to them, no doubt, after the\r\ngladiator had received the steel of his antagonist, and the thundering\r\nshout of \"Habet!\" had died away, the poor Scythian, or Roman, as the\r\ncase might be, turned a sadly inquiring eye--intent upon the hands of\r\nthe great personages on whom his doom depended--on the upturned or the\r\ndownturned thumb. A very interesting portion of the arena is the\r\nlabyrinth of corridors, passages, and stairs, which honeycomb its\r\nmassive masonry, and into which, in the event of a shower, the whole\r\nbody of spectators could at once retreat, leaving the great circles of\r\nstone as deserted as at midnight. So admirable, too, are the\r\narrangements, that there could have been very little crowding. The\r\nvomitories get wider and wider as they approach the entrance, where the\r\npeople would emerge on every side, like the drops of water flung off by\r\nthe rotatory motion of a mop. There was an odd resemblance to the\r\ngeneral disposition of the opera corridors and staircases, which struck\r\nme in the arrangement of the lobbies and passages behind. One could\r\nfancy the young Roman men about Nemauses, in their scented tunics,\r\nclasped with glittering stones and their broad purple girdles--the\r\nTyrian hue, as the poets say--gathering in knots, and discussing a blow\r\nwhich had split a fellow-creature's head open, as our own opera elegants\r\nmight Grisi's celebrated holding-note in _Norma_, or Duprez' famous _ut\r\ndu poitrine_. The execution of a _débutant_ with the sword might be\r\npraised, as the execution now-a-days of a _prima donna_. Rumours might\r\nbe discussed of a new net-and-trident man picked up in some obscure\r\narena, as the _cognoscenti_ now whisper the reported merits of a tenor\r\ndiscovered in Barcelona or Palermo; and the _habitués_ would delight to\r\ninform each other that the spirited and enterprising management had\r\nsecured the services of the celebrated Berbix, whose career at Massilia,\r\nfor instance, had excited such admiration--the _artiste_ having killed\r\nfifteen antagonists in less than a fortnight. And then, after the\r\npleasant and critical chat between the acts, the trumpets would again\r\nsound, and all the world would turn out upon the vast stone benches--the\r\nnobles and wealthy nearest the ring, as in the stalls with us, and the\r\nlower and slave population high up on the further benches, like the\r\nhumble folks and the footmen in the gallery--and then would recommence\r\nthat exhibition of which the Romans could never have enough, and of\r\nwhich they never tired--the excitement of the shedding of blood.\r\n\r\nFrom the arena I walked slowly on to the Maison Carrée. All the great\r\nRoman remains lie upon the open Boulevard, on the edge of the stacked\r\nand crowded old town, while without the circle rise the spacious streets\r\nof new _quartiers_ for the rich, and many a long straggling suburb,\r\nwhere, in mean garrets and unwholesome cellars, the poor handloom\r\nweavers produce webs of gorgeous silk which rival the choicest products\r\nof Lyons. Presently, to the left, appeared a horribly clumsy theatre;\r\nand, to the right, the wondrous Maison Carrée. The day of which I am\r\nwriting was certainly my day of architectural sensation. First, Rome,\r\nwith her hugeness and her symmetric strength, gripped me; and now,\r\nGreece, with her pure and etherial beauty, which is essentially of the\r\nspirit, enthralled me. The Maison Carrée was, no doubt, built by Roman\r\nhands, but entirely after Greek models. It is wholly of Athens: not at\r\nall of Rome--a Corinthian temple of the purest taste and divinest\r\nbeauty--small, slight, without an atom of the ponderous majesty of the\r\narena--reigning by love and smiles, like Venus; not by frowns and\r\nthunder, like Jove. Cardinal Alberoni said that the Maison Carrée was a\r\ngem which ought to be set in gold; and the two great Jupiters of\r\nFrance--Louis Quatorze and Napoleon--had both of them schemes for\r\nlifting the temple bodily out of the ground and carrying it to Paris.\r\nThe building is perfectly simple--merely an oblong square, with a\r\nportico, and fluted Corinthian pillars--yet the loveliness of it is like\r\nenchantment. The essence of its power over the senses appears to me to\r\nconsist in an exquisite subtlety of proportion, which amounts to the\r\nvery highest grace and the very purest and truest beauty. How many\r\n_quasi_ Grecian buildings had I seen--all porticoed and\r\ncaryatided--without a sensation, save that the pile before me was cold\r\nand perhaps correct--a sort of stone formulary. I had begun to fear that\r\nGreek beauty was too subtle for me, or that Greek beauty was cant, when\r\nthe Maison Carrée in a moment utterly undeceived me. The puzzle was\r\nsolved: I had never seen Grecian architecture before. The things which\r\nour domestic Pecksniffs call Grecian--their St. Martin's porticoes, and\r\nSt. Pancras churches--bear about the same relation to the divine\r\noriginal, as the old statue of George IV. at King's Cross to the Apollo\r\nBelvidere. Of course, these gentry--of whom we assuredly know none whose\r\npowers qualify them to grapple with, a higher task than a\r\ndock-warehouse or a railway tavern--have picked all manner of faults in\r\nthe divine proportions of this wondrous edifice. There is some\r\nbricklaying cant about a departure from the proportions of Vitruvius,\r\nwhich, I presume, are faithfully observed in the National Gallery, and\r\nsome modification of them, no doubt, in the Pavilion at Brighton--which\r\nvariations are gravely censured in the Maison Carrée; while, in order,\r\ndoubtless, to shew our modern superiority, the French hodmen have\r\nerected a theatre just opposite the Corinthian temple, with a\r\nportico--heavens and earth! such a portico--a mass of mathematical\r\nclumsiness, with pillars like the legs of aldermen suffering from\r\ndropsy. Anything more intensely ugly is not to be found in Christendom.\r\nIt actually beats the worst monstrosity of London; and this dreadful\r\ncaricature of the deathless work of the glorious Greeks is erected right\r\nopposite to, perhaps, the most perfect piece of building and\r\nstone-carving in the world.\r\n\r\nI believe that it requires neither art-training nor classic knowledge to\r\nenjoy the unearthly beauty of the Corinthian temple. Give me a\r\nhealthy-minded youth, who has never heard of Alcibiades, Themistocles,\r\nSocrates, or Æschylus, but who has the natural appreciation of\r\nbeauty--who can admire the droop of a lily, the spring of a deer, the\r\nflight of an eagle--set him opposite the Maison Carrée, and the\r\nsensation of divine, transcendant beauty, will rush into his heart and\r\nbrain, as when contemplating the flower, or beast or bird. The big man\r\nin the parish at home will point you out the graces of the new church of\r\nSt. Kold Without, designed after the antique manner, by the celebrated\r\nMr. Jones Smith, and because you hesitate to acknowledge them, will read\r\nyou a benignant lecture on the impossibility of making people, with\r\nuneducated taste, fully appreciate what he will be sure to call the\r\n\"severity\" of Greek architecture; the worthy man himself having been\r\ndinned with the apocryphal loveliness in question until he has come\r\nactually to believe in it. Never mind the grave sermons preached about\r\neducating and training taste. An educated and trained taste will, no\r\ndoubt, admire with even more fond appreciation and far higher enjoyment;\r\nbut he who cannot, at the first glance, see and feel the perfect grace\r\nof pure Grecian art, must be insensible to the blue of the sky, to the\r\nbeauty of running water, to the song of the birds and the silver\r\nradiance of moonlight. I never revisited the amphitheatre while I\r\nremained in Nismes, but I haunted the temple. The grandeur, and the\r\nmassiveness of the Roman work, was like the north wind. It rudely\r\nbuffeted the wayfarer, but he clung to his cloak. The Grecian trophy\r\nshone out like the gentle sun, and the traveller doffed mantle and cap\r\nto pay it adoration.\r\n\r\nNismes, as most people know, is one of the points of France where\r\nProtestantism and Catholicism still glare upon each other with hostile\r\nand threatening eyes. The old Catholic and Huguenot hatred has descended\r\nlineally from the remote times of the Albigenses, and at this moment\r\nbroods as bitterly over the olive city as when Raymond of Toulouse\r\nproclaimed a crusade against the Paulician heretics, and twenty\r\nthousand people were slaughtered under the pastoral care of the Bishop\r\nof Beziers. That the animosity, however, has not died out centuries ago,\r\nwe have to thank the pious precautions of Louis XIV., Madame de\r\nMaintenon, and the priest, who waged as bitter war upon the Huguenots of\r\nthe Cevennes as ever their fathers of these same mountains had been\r\nexposed to. The dragoonades are still fiercely remembered in the South.\r\nThe old-world stories in Scotland of the cruelties of Claverhouse and\r\nhis life-guards, have well-nigh ceased to excite anything like personal\r\nbitterness; but in portions of Languedoc, the animosity between\r\nneighbour and neighbour--Catholic and Protestant--is still deepened and\r\nwidened by the oft-told legends of those wretched religious wars. Nismes\r\nis the head quarters of the sectarianism--Catholics and Protestants are\r\ndrawn up in two compacted hostile bodies, living, for the most part, in\r\nseparate _quartiers_; marrying each party within itself; scandalising\r\neach party the other whenever it has a chance; and carrying, indeed, the\r\nparty spirit so far as absolutely to have established Protestant _cafés_\r\nand Catholic _cafés_, the _habitués_ of which will no more enter the\r\nrival establishments than they would enter the opposition churches.\r\n\r\nThe day after my arrival, I had a singular opportunity of becoming\r\nacquainted with the spirit of the place. North from Nismes rises a\r\nspecies of chaos of steep hills and deep valleys, or rather ravines,\r\ncomposed almost entirely of shingle and rock, covered over, however,\r\nwith olive-groves and vines, and dotted with little white summer-houses,\r\nto which almost the entire middle and working class population retire\r\nupon Sundays to pass the day, partly in cultivating their patches of\r\nland--there is hardly a family without an allotment--and partly to amuse\r\nthemselves after the toils of the week. Rambling among these rugged\r\nhills and dales, I chanced to ask my way of a person I met descending\r\ntowards Nismes. He was a tall, ungainly, raw-boned man--pallid and worn,\r\nas if with sedentary labour; but he seemed intelligent, and was very\r\npolite--pointing out a number of localities around. Presently, he told\r\nme that he had been up to his _cabane_, or summer-house; that he was a\r\nsilkweaver in Nismes; that his wages were so poor, that he had a hard\r\nstruggle to live; but that he still managed to give up an hour's work or\r\nso a-day to go and feed his rabbits at the _cabane_. As we talked, he\r\ninquired whether I were not a foreigner--an Englishman--and, with some\r\nhesitation, but with great eagerness--a Protestant? My affirmative\r\nanswer to the last interrogatory produced a magical effect. The man's\r\nface actually gleamed. He jumped off the ground, let fall his apronful\r\nof melons and fresh figs, while he clutched both of my hands in his, and\r\nexclaimed, \"A Protestant! _Dieu merci! Dieu merci!_ an English\r\nProtestant! Oh, how glad I am to see an English Protestant! Listen,\r\nmonsieur. We are here. We of the religion (the old phrase--as old as\r\nRosny and Coligni), we are here fifteen thousand strong--fifteen\r\nthousand, monsieur. Don't believe those who say only ten. Fifteen\r\nthousand, monsieur--good men and true. All ready--all standing by one\r\nanother--all _braves_--all on the _qui vive_--all prepared, if the hour\r\nshould come. We know each other--we love each other, and we hate\"--a\r\npause; then, with a significant grin--\"_les autres_. You will tell that,\r\nin England, monsieur, to our brothers. Fifteen thousand, monsieur; and\r\nevery man, woman, and child, true to the cause and the faith.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole tone of the orator did not appear to me to be so much a matter\r\nof religious bitterness, as it marked a hatred of race. The two\r\ncontending parties at Nismes were evidently of different blood: their\r\nreligious animosities had gradually divided them into two distinct and\r\nhostile peoples.\r\n\r\n\"See!\" said the weaver; \"this is the Protestant side of the valley,--all\r\nProtestants here. Not a Catholic _cabane_--no, no! they must go\r\nelsewhere,--we have nothing to do with them,--we shake off the dust of\r\nour feet upon them and theirs. You and I are one, upon our own\r\nground--Protestant ground--staunch and true;\" and he stamped with his\r\nfoot upon the pebbles. \"Monsieur must absolutely go with me to my\r\n_cabane_, and drink a glass of wine to the good cause; and see my\r\nrabbits--Protestant rabbits.\"\r\n\r\nWho could resist this last attraction? We turned and toiled up the\r\nflinty paths together; my acquaintance informing me, with great pride,\r\nthat M. Guizot was a good Protestant of Nismes, as his father, who had\r\nfallen, _dans le terreur_, was before him. He understood that M. Guizot\r\nwas then in England, and he was sure that he would be delighted at\r\nseeing such a fine Protestant country, and such a staunch Protestant\r\npeople. Stopping at length at an unpainted door, in the rough,\r\nunmortared wall, my friend opened it, and we stepped into a little patch\r\nof garden, planted with olives and straggling vine-bushes. \"They are\r\nmuch better cultivated, and give better oil and better wine,\" he said,\r\n\"than the Catholic grounds;\" and I am sure he believed the asseveration.\r\nHaving duly inspected the \"Protestant rabbits,\" we entered the _cabane_,\r\na bare, rough, white-washed room, with a table, a few chairs, and\r\nunglazed lattices. Unless when the mistral blows, the open air is seldom\r\nor never unpleasant; and then wooden shutters are applied to the\r\nwindward side of the houses. On this occasion, however, there was not a\r\nbreath stirring amid the silvery grey leaves of the olives. The\r\ngrasshoppers--fellows of a size which would astound Sir Thomas\r\nGresham--chirped and leaped in the grass at the foot of the wall; scores\r\nand scores of lithe, yellow lizards, with the blackest of eyes, flashed\r\nup and down over the rough stones, and shot in and out of the crevices;\r\nbut, excepting these sights and sounds, all around was hushed and\r\nmotionless; and the sun, wintry though it was, flooded all the still,\r\nbrown valley with a deluge of pure, hot light.\r\n\r\nThe weaver filled a very comfortable couple of glasses with a small, but\r\nnot ill-tasted, wine. \"Here's to----;\" he uttered a sentiment not\r\ncomplimentary to the Catholic Church, and, indeed, consigning it to the\r\nwarmest of quarters, and took off his liquor with undeniable unction. I\r\nneed not say whether I drunk the toast: anyhow, I drunk the wine.\r\n\r\n\"And now look there,\" continued my host, pointing with his empty glass\r\nthrough the open window, to the north. The bare, blue hills of the\r\nCevennes lay--a long ridge of mountain scenery, stretching from the\r\nvalley of the Rhone as far and farther than the eye could follow\r\nthem--towards that of the Garonne.\r\n\r\n\"There it was,\" he said, \"that were fought the fiercest battles, in\r\nthose cruel times, between the people of the religion and the troops of\r\nthe king. Can you see a valley or a ravine just over the olive there? My\r\neyes are too much worn to see it; but we look at it every Sunday--my\r\nwife and my children. That was the valley, monsieur, where my family\r\nlived for ages and ages, weaving the rough cloth that they made in those\r\ndays, and tending their flocks upon the hill. Early in the troubles,\r\ntheir cottage was beset by the dragoons of the king. The mother of the\r\nfamily was suckling her child. They bound her to the bed-post, and put\r\nthe child just beyond her reach, and told her that not a drop more\r\nshould pass its lips till she cried _Ave Maria_ and made the sign of the\r\ncross. They took the father and hung him by the feet, head downward,\r\nfrom the roof-tree, and he died hanging. The children they ranged round\r\nthe mother, and tied matches between their fingers; and, when the first\r\nmatch burned down to the flesh, the mother cried _Ave Maria_ and made\r\nthe sign of the cross. Then they released her, and held an orgie in the\r\ncottage all night long, and the widow and the children served them. Next\r\nmorning, the woman was mad, and she wandered away into the woods with\r\nher baby at her breast, and no one heard of her more. The children were\r\nscattered over the country; and, whether they lived or died, I know\r\nnot; but one of them, monsieur, the eldest girl, whose name was Nicole,\r\nbecame a famous prophetess. Yes, monsieur, she was inspired, and taught\r\nthe people among the rocks and the wild gorges of the hills. First, she\r\nhad _l'avertissement_--that is, the warning, or first degree of\r\ninspiration; and then the _souffle_, or the breath of the Lord, came on\r\nher, and she spoke; at last, she was endowed with _la prophetie_, and\r\ntold what would come to pass. Yes, monsieur; and many of her prophecies\r\nare yet preserved, and they came true; for, in times like these, God\r\nacts by extraordinary means. The people, monsieur, loved her, and\r\nhonoured her, and kept her so well, and hid her so closely, that the\r\npersecutors could never seize her; and she survived the troubles; and I,\r\nmonsieur, a poor weaver of Nismes, have the honour to be her\r\ndescendant.\"\r\n\r\nThat night I walked late along the Boulevards. Protestant _cafés_ and\r\nCatholic _cafés_ were full and busy, and, no doubt, resounding with the\r\npolemics of the warring creeds. Outside all, the by turns straggling and\r\ncrowded town lay, bathed in the most glorious flood of moonlight, poured\r\ndown, happily, alike upon Papist and Protestant, lighting up the grey\r\ncathedral with its Gothic arches, and the heathen temple with its fluted\r\ncolumns, and surely preaching by the universal-blessing ray that\r\nsermon--so continuous in its delivery, yet so little heeded by the\r\ncongregation of the world--the sermon which enjoins charity and\r\nforbearance, and love and peace, among all men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE LAST.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE IN FRANCE--ITS BACKWARD STATE--CENTRALISING\r\nTENDENCY--SUBDIVISION OF PROPERTY--ITS EFFECTS--FRENCH\r\n\"ENCUMBERED ESTATES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages I have sketched, with as much regard to a\r\nreadable liveliness, and to vivid local colouring as I could command,\r\nthe features and incidents of part--the most interesting one--of an\r\nextended journey through France. My primary purpose in undertaking the\r\nlatter was, to prepare a view of the social and agricultural condition\r\nof the peasantry, for publication in the columns of the _Morning\r\nChronicle_; and accordingly a series of letters, devoted to that\r\nimportant subject, duly appeared. These communications, however, were\r\nnecessarily confined to statements of agricultural progress, and the\r\ninvestigation of solid social subjects, to the exclusion of those\r\nmatters of personal incident and artistic, literary, and legendary\r\nsignificance, which naturally occur in the prosecution of a desultory\r\nand inquiring journey. To this latter field--that of the tourist rather\r\nthan the commissioner--then, I have devoted the foregoing chapters; but\r\nI am unwilling to send them forth without appending to them--extracted\r\nfrom my concluding Letter in the _Morning Chronicle_--a summary of my\r\nimpressions of the social condition of the French agricultural\r\npopulation, and the effects of the system of the infinitesimal division\r\nof the land. These impressions are founded upon a five months' journey\r\nthrough France, keeping mainly in the country places, being constantly\r\nin communication with the people themselves, and hearing also the\r\nopinions of the priests and men of business engaged in rural affairs, as\r\nwell as reading authors upon all sides of the question. My conclusions I\r\nhave summed up carefully, and with great deliberation; and I offer them\r\nas an honest, and not ill-founded estimate of the present state and\r\nfuture prospects of rural France.\r\n\r\nThe French are undoubtedly at least a century behind us in agricultural\r\nscience and skill. This remark applies alike to breeding cattle and to\r\nraising crops. Agriculture in France is rather a handicraft than what it\r\nought to be--a science. As a general rule, the farmers of France are\r\nabout on a level with the ploughmen of England. When I say this, I mean\r\nthat the immense majority of the cultivators are unlettered\r\npeasants--hinds--who till the land in the unvarying, mechanical routine\r\nhanded down to them from their forefathers. Of agriculture, in any other\r\nsense than the rule-of-thumb practice of ploughing, sowing, reaping, and\r\nthreshing, they know literally nothing. Of the _rationale_ of the\r\nmanagement of land--of the reasons why so and so should be done--they\r\nthink no more than honest La Balafrè, whose only notion of a final cause\r\nwas the command of his superior officer. Thus they are bound down in the\r\nmost abject submission to every custom, for no other reason than that it\r\nis a custom: their fathers did so and so, and therefore, and for no\r\nother reason, the sons do the same. I could see no struggling upwards,\r\nno longing for a better condition, no discontent, even with the\r\nvegetable food upon which they lived. All over the land there brooded\r\none almost unvaried mist of dull, unenlightened, passive content--I do\r\nnot mean social--but industrial content.\r\n\r\nThere are two causes principally chargeable with this. In the first\r\nplace, strange as it may seem in a country in which two-thirds of the\r\npopulation are agriculturists, agriculture is a very unhonoured\r\noccupation. Develop, in the slightest degree, a Frenchman's mental\r\nfaculties, and he flies to a town as surely as steel filings fly to a\r\nloadstone. He has no rural tastes--no delight in rural habits. A French\r\namateur farmer would, indeed, be a sight to see. Again, this national\r\ntendency is directly encouraged by the centralizing system of\r\ngovernment--by the multitude of officials, and by the payment of all\r\nfunctionaries. From all parts of France, men of great energy and\r\nresource struggle up and fling themselves on the world of Paris. There\r\nthey try to become great functionaries. Through every department of the\r\neighty-four, men of less energy and resource struggle up to the\r\n_chef-lieu_--the provincial capital. There they try to become little\r\nfunctionaries. Go still lower--deal with a still smaller scale--and the\r\nresult will be the same. As is the department to France, so is the\r\narrondissement to the department, and the commune to the arrondissement.\r\nNine-tenths of those who have, or think they have, heads on their\r\nshoulders, struggle into towns to fight for office. Nine-tenths of those\r\nwho are, or are deemed by themselves or others, too stupid for anything\r\nelse, are left at home to till the fields, and breed the cattle, and\r\nprune the vines, as their ancestors did for generations before them.\r\nThus there is singularly little intelligence left in the country. The\r\nwhole energy, and knowledge, and resource of the land are barrelled up\r\nin the towns. You leave one city, and, in many cases, you will not meet\r\nan educated or cultivated individual until you arrive at another--all\r\nbetween is utter intellectual barrenness. The English country gentleman,\r\nwe all know, is not a faultless character, but his useful qualities far\r\nprevail over his defects; and it is only when traversing a land all but\r\ndestitute of any such order that the fatal effects of the blank are\r\nfully realized. Were there more country gentlemen in France, there would\r\nbe more animal food and more wheaten bread in the country. The very idea\r\nof a great proprietor living upon his estates implies the fact of an\r\neducated person--an individual more or less rubbed and polished and\r\nenlightened by society--taking his place amongst a class who must\r\nnaturally look up to him, and whose mass he must necessarily, to a\r\ngreater or less degree, leaven. It is easy to joke about English country\r\ngentlemen--about their foibles, and prejudices, and absurd points; but\r\nto the jokers I would seriously say, \"Go to France; examine its\r\nagriculture, and the structure and calibre of its rural society, and see\r\nthe result of the utter absence of a class of men--certainly not\r\nSolomons, and as certainly not Chesterfields, but, for all that, most\r\nuseful personages--individuals with capital, with, at all events, a\r\ncertain degree of enlightenment--taking an active interest in\r\nfarming--often amateur farmers themselves--the patrons of district\r\nclubs, and ploughing matches, and cattle-shows--and, above all, living\r\ndaily among their tenantry, and having an active and direct interest in\r\nthat tenantry's prosperity.\" I do not mean to say that here and there,\r\nall over France, there may not be found active and intelligent resident\r\nlandlords, nor that, in the north of France, there may not be discovered\r\nintelligent and clear-headed tenant-farmers; but the rule is as I have\r\nstated. Utterly ignorant boors are allowed to plod on from generation to\r\ngeneration, wrapped in the most dismal mists of agricultural\r\nsuperstition; while what in America would be called the \"smart\" part of\r\nthe population, are intriguing, and constructing and undoing _complots_,\r\nin the towns. To all present appearance, a score of dynasties may\r\nsucceed each other in France before La Vendée takes its place beside\r\nNorfolk, or before Limousin rivals the Lothians.\r\n\r\nA word as to the subdivision of property. I know the extreme\r\ndifficulties of the subject, and the moral considerations which, in\r\nconnection with it, are often placed in opposition to admitted physical\r\nand economical disadvantages. I shall, therefore, without discussing the\r\nquestion at any length, mention two or three personally ascertained\r\nfacts:--\r\n\r\nThe tendency of landed properties, under the system in question, is to\r\ncontinual diminution of seize.\r\n\r\nThis tendency does _not_ stop with the interests of the parties\r\nconcerned--it goes on in spite of them.\r\n\r\nAnd the only practical check is nothing but a new evil. When a man finds\r\nthat his patch of land is insufficient to support his family, he borrows\r\nmoney and buys more land. In nine cases out of ten, the interest to be\r\npaid to the lender is greater than the profit which the borrower can\r\nextract from the land--and bankruptcy, and reduction to the condition of\r\na day-labourer, is sooner or later the inevitable result.\r\n\r\nThe infinitesimal patches of land are cultivated in the most rude and\r\nuneconomical fashion. Not a franc of capital, further than that sunk in\r\nthe purchase of spades, picks, and hoes, is expended on them. They are\r\nundrained, ill-manured, expensively worked, and they would often produce\r\nno profit whatever, were it not that the proprietor is the labourer, and\r\nthat he looks for little or nothing save a recompense for his toil in a\r\nbare subsistence. It is easy to see how the consumer must fare if the\r\nproducer possess little or no surplus after his own necessities are\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed from the above remarks, that I conceive that in\r\nno circumstances, and under no conditions, can the soil be\r\nadvantageously divided into minute properties. The rule which strikes me\r\nas applying to the matter is this:--where spade-husbandry, can be\r\nlegitimately adopted, then the extreme subdivision of land loses much,\r\nif not all, of its evils. The reason is plain: spade-husbandry, while it\r\npays the proprietor fair wages, also, in certain cases, develops in an\r\neconomical manner the resources of the soil. The instance of\r\nmarket-gardens near a populous town is a case in point. But in a remote\r\ndistrict, removed from markets, ill provided with the means of\r\nlocomotion--where cereals, not vegetables, must be raised--spade-labour\r\nis so far mere toil flung away. Near Nismes I found a man digging a\r\nfield which ought to have been ploughed. He told me that the spade\r\nproduced more than the plough. Then why did not the farmers use\r\nspade-husbandry? \"Because, although spade-husbandry was very productive,\r\nit was still more expensive. It paid a small proprietor who could do the\r\nwork himself, but not a large proprietor, who had to remunerate his\r\nlabourers.\" Herein, then, lies the fallacy. Truly considered, a mode of\r\ncultivation unprofitable for the great proprietor, must be unprofitable,\r\nin the long run, for the small proprietor also. The former, by\r\nspade-husbandry, loses his profit by paying extravagantly for labour;\r\nthe latter must pay for labour as well, but he pays himself, and is\r\ntherefore unconscious of the outlay--an outlay which is, nevertheless,\r\nnot the less real. If the plough, at an expense of 5_s._, can produce\r\n20_s._ worth of produce--and if the spade, at an expense of 20_s._, can\r\nproduce 30_s._ worth of produce--the difference between the\r\nproportionate outlays is so much deducted from the resources of the\r\ncountry in which the transaction takes place; and this because that\r\ndifference of labour, or of money representing labour, if otherwise\r\napplied--as by the agency of the plough it would be free to be\r\napplied--might, profitably to its proprietor, still raise the sum total\r\nof the production to the stated amount of 30_s._\r\n\r\nAre small properties, then, in cases in which spade-husbandry cannot be\r\neconomically applied, injurious to the social and industrial interests\r\nof the community in which they exist?\r\n\r\nThe following propositions appear to me to sum up what may be said on\r\neither side of the question:\r\n\r\nSmall landed holdings undoubtedly tend to produce an industrious\r\npopulation. A man always works hardest for himself.\r\n\r\nSmall landed holdings tend to breed a spirit of independence, and\r\nwholesome moral self-appreciation and reliance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand--\r\n\r\nSmall landed holdings, by breeding a poor and ignorant race of\r\nproprietors, keep back agriculture, and injure the whole community of\r\nconsumers; and--\r\n\r\nSmall landed holdings tend to grow smaller than it is the interest of\r\ntheir owners that they should become. Capital, borrowed at usurious\r\nrates of interest, is then had recourse to for the purpose of enlarging\r\nindividual properties--and the result is the production of a race of\r\ninvolved, mortgaged, and frequently bankrupt proprietors.\r\n\r\nAt this present moment, I believe the proprietorship of France to be as\r\nbankrupt as that of the south-west of Ireland. The number of \"Encumbered\r\nEstates\" across the Channel would stagger the stoutest calculator. The\r\ncapitalists, notaries, land-agents, and others in the towns, and not the\r\npeasantry, are the real owners of the mortgaged soil. The nominal\r\nproprietors are sinking deeper and deeper at every struggle, and they\r\nsee no hope before them--save one--Socialism. French Socialism is simply\r\nthe result of French poverty. A ruined labourer has no resource but\r\ncasual charity. No law stands between him and starvation. He has no\r\nright to his life unless he can support himself; and as the ponderous\r\nmachine of the law gradually grinds down his property to an extent too\r\nsmall for him to exist on, and as the increasing interest swallows up\r\nthe comparatively diminishing products, he sees nothing for it but a\r\nscramble. There is property--there is food--and it will go hard but he\r\nshall have a share of them. Herein is the whole problem of the dreaded\r\nSocialism. I cannot put the matter better than in the words of the old\r\nsong--\r\n\r\n    \"Moll in the wad and I fell out,\r\n    And this is what it was all about,\r\n    She had money, and I had none,\r\n    And that was the way the row begun.\"\r\n\r\nWhether a Poor-law, and a change in the law of heritage might not check\r\nthe evil, I am not, of course, going to inquire; but the present state\r\nof rural France--all political considerations left aside--appears to me\r\nto point to the possibility, if not the probability, of the world seeing\r\na greater and bloodier _Jacquerie_ yet than it ever saw before.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 THE END.\r\n\r\n          HENRY VIZETELLY, PRINTER AND ENGRAVER, GOUGH SQUARE,\r\n                         FLEET STREET, LONDON.",
