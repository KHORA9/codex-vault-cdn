H. WORST\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ambitious young commonwealth, in conjunction with other states\r\ncomprising the great Northwest, occupies a commanding position in the\r\nindustrial and economic affairs of this nation.\r\n\r\nMines of gold and silver or forests primeval North Dakota does not have;\r\nbut from the millions of fertile acres comprising our vast agricultural\r\nempire, we may reap a golden harvest every year that will exceed in\r\nwealth the output of all the golden placers in the western mountains.\r\n\r\nThe harvest of minerals, however, can be gathered but once. Time will\r\nnot restore the precious nuggets.\r\n\r\nThe forests once harvested can, at great expense, be renewed in the\r\ncourse of a century; but our harvest of domestic plants and animals\r\nrecurs with every passing season to recompense the farmer for his toil\r\nand to enrich the farmer's friends.\r\n\r\nWhat a precious theme is harvest! The hopes, the well-being, the life of\r\nthe world is fast bound up in the magic of this single word.\r\n\r\nThe soil upon which the harvest depends, moreover, is God's benediction\r\nto humanity. Measured by consequences, Heaven has vouchsafed no form of\r\nstewardship that is fraught with such tremendous responsibilities as\r\nthis stewardship of the soil. In the final analysis this stewardship\r\nrepresents the farmer's obligation to society.\r\n\r\nAnd yet sacred as is the soil and binding as is the farmer's obligation\r\nto society, the means for providing the world's food is nevertheless at\r\nhis mercy.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the soil can readily be depleted of its\r\nfertility and thus robbed of its strength by a system of exploitation,\r\ncommonly referred to as \"extensive farming.\" Too much of our land is\r\nbeing thus exploited. On the other hand the productiveness of the soil\r\nmay be very greatly improved. Denmark, Belgium, Germany, and other\r\nEuropean nations have fully demonstrated, that by the application of\r\nscience to the art of agriculture, the productiveness of the soil can be\r\nmultiplied almost to the limit of necessity.\r\n\r\n_A Progressive Agriculture._ Fortunately Nature has supplied every means\r\nfor the development of a progressive and permanent agriculture. It is\r\nalso obvious that it is man's privilege, if not his mission, to improve\r\nupon Nature--to substitute quality for mere physical endurance, in\r\nagricultural products.\r\n\r\nBy the grace of Providence the individuals of the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms were not created inflexible in habit or perfect in form, but\r\nthey may be changed in character and quality and intrinsic worth at the\r\nwill of the intelligent and observing farmer. To this end agricultural\r\neducation lends its beneficent influence. Man's dominion over Nature\r\nwould be such in name only were it not for the class-room and the\r\nlaboratory, for research and investigation; for by these means\r\nscientific knowledge is obtained and diffused and eventually brought to\r\nbear upon the solution of the most vital problems that concern the human\r\nfamily. These problems center largely around food and clothing. To\r\nsupply these necessities an industry is created--the business of\r\nagriculture--the most important industry in all the world. An industry\r\nof such fundamental importance, moreover, should receive from the states\r\nand from the federal government financial consideration in proportion to\r\nits moral and economic importance as well as to the probabilities that\r\nmay be entertained for its continued improvement. For abundant as are\r\nearth's natural resources, yet without the aid and direction of human\r\nintelligence they could not supply the world's ever increasing\r\npopulation with food, clothing and shelter. Complying with known\r\nconditions of natural reciprocity, however, the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms submit to whatever modifications become necessary in order to\r\nsupply the needs of the human family.\r\n\r\n_Nature's Forces Operate Blindly._ Moved, therefore, partly by necessity\r\nand partly by curiosity, the material world has been and is being\r\ncontinually modified by the ingenuity of man. Undirected, however,\r\nNature's forces act blindly; hence, produce mainly such qualities in\r\norganic life as endurance, or adaptation to local soil and climatic\r\nconditions. In the animal and vegetable kingdoms the universal demand of\r\nNature is to perpetuate their species--\"to produce after their own\r\nkind.\" In accordance with this law the humblest plant or animal is\r\ncompelled to maintain a perpetual warfare against its fellows for means\r\nof subsistence.\r\n\r\nThis competition for nourishment is usually so sharp and continuous that\r\nmere existence or endurance rather than excellence or quality, seems to\r\nbe the end and aim of natural law. Hence, the strong survive and the\r\nweak perish.\r\n\r\n_Beginnings of Agriculture._ Here agriculture begins. By relieving\r\nplants of this intense competition by means of tillage, and by selecting\r\nthe most promising for domestication, they are enabled to use all their\r\nenergy for the development of those qualities which add to their\r\nintrinsic value, instead of expending it in the struggle for existence.\r\nGiven, thus, free access to the soil and sunshine, with needful\r\nnourishment supplied and their fungous or parasitical enemies destroyed,\r\nthe domesticated plants yield trustful obedience to the protecting hand\r\nof the husbandman. Freed altogether from the necessity of\r\nself-protection they become prolific and pour into the world's bread\r\nbasket in marvelous abundance the seeds--a single one of which would\r\nsuffice to answer Nature's law for the propagation of species. This\r\nsurplus of yield for which each plant has need of but a single seed, and\r\nmore especially this improvement of quality for which the plant has no\r\nconcern, is Nature's reciprocal reward for having given her children\r\ngratuitously that protection which otherwise they would have had to\r\nprovide for themselves.\r\n\r\nNor is animal life less susceptible of improvement. Between the animal\r\nwild and the animal domesticated--that is whether Nature-bred or\r\nman-bred--the range in quality is as marked as that which separates the\r\nsavage from the philosopher.\r\n\r\nNature demands only strength, endurance; but man demands quality and\r\nexcellence, and he proceeds scientifically to accomplish his purpose. By\r\nconscious design and a sort of mental architecture the animal to be is\r\nplanned, and the picture thus conceived in the brain of the breeder\r\nbecomes incarnated in the form, size and character of the animal. Not\r\nonly is the animal created with the desired quality as to its parts and\r\nproducts, but its nature is transformed from fear and ferocity to that\r\nof trust and docility.\r\n\r\nFor example the descendants of the wild horse are not only changed from\r\nvicious brutes to trustful beasts of burden, but are also differentiated\r\ninto many different breeds to meet the demands of strength, speed or\r\nendurance. Specimens of such breeds as the Belgian, Percheron or\r\nHambletonian exist as monuments to the breeder's art no less renowned\r\nand for more useful purpose than anything in Nature, the likeness of\r\nwhich the sculptor has wrought in marble or the artist has transferred\r\nfrom life to canvass.\r\n\r\nFrom the wild buffalo, presumably, the ideal strains of pedigree kine,\r\nfor beef or dairy products, have been created as surely and even more\r\nscientifically than the sculptor has immortalized his ideals in granite\r\nor marble.\r\n\r\nThus animal life is to the skillful breeder as clay in the hands of the\r\npotter, and though a supersensitive and artificial generation may look\r\nupon this form of genius as vulgar, it nevertheless is God's work and\r\nthe doers thereof are working with God. For without this incarnation of\r\nquality into plant and animal life the world's population could not\r\nsupply its fundamental wants nor could civilization rise above the\r\nanimal instincts in man.\r\n\r\nThe farmer, therefore, is a most important personage, and his vocation\r\nthe most absolutely needful in all the world. The farmer is in very\r\ntruth a creator, certainly a co-creator, improving Nature by the aid of\r\nscience, just as the human mind and character are improved by means of\r\neducation. And when the prejudice of the ages has been rolled away the\r\nname \"farmer\" will rank among the most envied names that enrich our\r\nmother tongue. Here, indeed, may be verified the saving: \"The first\r\nshall be last and the last shall be first.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we honor the sculptor, the painter or the poet whose genius\r\npartakes of the immortal, and yet satisfies no hungry mouth, some degree\r\nof honor might well be given to this other sort of genius which has\r\nmultiplied human food beyond computation and has otherwise so largely\r\nmitigated the burdens of life.\r\n\r\n_Vocational Education._ From the foregoing it is little wonder that the\r\neducation of the masses is surely and rapidly gravitating from the\r\nclassical to the utilitarian, from the formal to the vocational. The\r\nworld's work must be done, and as those whose stewardship is the soil\r\nare compelled to render a combined physical and mental service in order\r\nto discharge their social obligations, they are entitled to education in\r\nharmony with the tasks awaiting them, to the end that they may work\r\nintelligently, hence joyfully.\r\n\r\nAgriculture and engineering, therefore, are fundamental vocations when\r\nconsidered either from the view-point of necessity or the country's\r\nprosperity. By many, however, the spiritual well-being of a people is\r\nconsidered paramount, and in a sense it is, but a cheerful soul seldom\r\ninhabits a naked or hungry body.\r\n\r\nAs food, clothing and shelter are absolute necessities, no degree of\r\nculture or religious enthusiasm can render them less needful. Heaven's\r\nchoicest physical gift, the soil, provides the means for acquiring these\r\nindispensable necessities, and the vocation that accepts the\r\nresponsibility of its stewardship ministers to the physical, as\r\neducators minister to the mental, or the clergy to the spiritual needs\r\nof man. Moreover, in the order of Nature the physical takes precedence,\r\nbeing primary and basic, and until legitimate physical wants are\r\nsupplied, neither mental nor spiritual food can be satisfactorily\r\nassimilated.\r\n\r\nA commonwealth, therefore, that educates her children in due proportion\r\nto and in harmony with the demands of her principal industry, acts the\r\npart of wisdom. In this the state becomes the servant of both present\r\nand future generations by training her children for the conservation of\r\nNature's gifts, while yet multiplying their use for the comfort and\r\nhappiness of all the people. If the clergy would preach occasionally\r\nfrom the book of Nature, they would discover a proximity to and\r\ndependence upon God enjoyed by him who sows and reaps, who cultivates\r\nanimals and flowers, who creates things and works miracles as his\r\nordinary life work, which few others can enjoy. Such themes might not\r\nonly be expounded with profit to those who work their fellowmen, but\r\nshould also be impressed betimes upon those who work the soil for the\r\ngood of their fellowmen.\r\n\r\n_The Paramount Problem._ The paramount problem, therefore, is to make\r\nthe conditions of rural life desirable--to convert farming into an\r\nenjoyable vocation; to make farm life and its labors a business to be\r\nenvied and not despised. The fact is, planning for beauty and comfort in\r\nthe city has progressed far and away beyond the country. It now but\r\nremains for the country to catch up and go the city many times better.\r\nThis is entirely possible, since the great \"out doors\" is a country\r\nheritage and ample spaces are available for exterior delights such as\r\ntrees, shrubbery and flowers, and for free access to abundance of pure\r\nair and sunshine.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we should not forget that we are now living in a new world.\r\nThe old agriculture and its associated rural industries have been shaken\r\nto their very foundation. This makes the solution of the rural problem,\r\nto some extent, speculative.\r\n\r\nFor one thing the country is becoming urbanized. This may prove helpful.\r\nAgain it may not. Individualism, however, is giving place more and more\r\nto commercialized enterprise. At the same time the evils of transient\r\ntenantry follow close upon the heels of successful farming, where\r\nfarmers rent their land and move to town; and also of unsuccessful\r\nfarming, where the mortgage shark eventually becomes possessed of the\r\nland. What the state needs to encourage, therefore, is farm ownership by\r\nthe many rather than by the few, and farm ownership rather than farm\r\ntenantry. We must retain on the farm, as farmers, the best type of\r\nAmerican manhood and womanhood or the nation will fall into decay, just\r\nas Rome fell with the decline of her agrarian influence.\r\n\r\nThe consolidated country school, by rendering obsolete the one room\r\ndistrict school house, is a progressive step toward improved educational\r\nfacilities for rural children.\r\n\r\nThe country church, on the other hand, has become more decadent than\r\naggressive. This among other rural agencies is not organized in\r\nproportion to its importance. Some progress, however, is being made by\r\nmeans of social organizations, but the ultimate solution of the rural\r\nproblem depends more largely upon education than upon any other single\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\n_Rural Social Leaders._ Rural social leaders in full sympathy with the\r\ncountry life movement will find here a fruitful field for earnest\r\nendeavor. To no class should the state look for such leadership, and\r\nwith so much assurance, as to the alumni of its Agricultural College.\r\nEducated at public expense and in an institution of higher learning that\r\nstands specifically for all-round rural improvement and rural\r\npatriotism, the students that go out from this college cannot\r\nmisinterpret their duties nor fail to understand the responsibilities\r\nthey assume as graduates of the North Dakota Agricultural College. Nor\r\nis their field of labor an unenviable one. It may at times seem irksome,\r\neven discouraging, but nevertheless it is the most exalted and dignified\r\ncalling to which men and women of special training and culture can\r\naspire.\r\n\r\nTo rescue the soil from the indifference and greed and selfishness\r\nwherein this generation unwittingly robs succeeding generations of their\r\nrightful inheritance, and to rescue the very vocation of agriculture\r\nfrom mercenary interests is a mission worthy of the best leadership and\r\npatriotism of our day. But it must not stop even at this. The public\r\nwelfare demands that nearly half the population of the entire country,\r\nand certainly four-fifths of the population of this state, shall\r\npermanently pursue agriculture for a livelihood. This vocation,\r\ntherefore, must be made so desirable and satisfying that that number\r\nwill joyfully accept it as a matter of free choice. It must be so\r\ndeveloped that it will afford an unsurpassed market for energy and\r\nbrains, and so independent of parasitical interests that when two\r\nbushels of wheat are grown where one now grows the producer will receive\r\nthe benefit.\r\n\r\n_Increased Production Not Sufficient._ Hitherto the agencies for rural\r\nimprovement, both state and federal, have directed their energies\r\nchiefly toward increased production. And this with but scant\r\nconsideration for profits that should be realized by the producer as a\r\nresult of the larger yields. Material prosperity, however, is not a\r\nsufficient motive, except where it assuredly is used to improve the\r\nmoral and social conditions of the community life. To double the yield\r\nof crops without doubling the enjoyments of living and improving home\r\ncomforts accordingly, will avail but little toward developing rural\r\nconditions that will withstand the competition and false allurements of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n_Urban Degeneracy._ A nation's strength, moreover, is a matter of blood\r\nand brain fiber. Urban degeneracy is an accepted biological fact. The\r\ndissipation, lack of physical exercise in the open air, and high\r\npressure living and working leaves in its trail a progeny diminishing in\r\nnumbers and decadent in those high qualities essential to good\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nDemocracy, as a permanent institution, however, is not yet an assured\r\nfact. The experiment of self-government is still in the making. Its\r\nperpetuity cannot be predicated upon scheming traders, money brokers and\r\npolitical manipulators, but must depend in the last analysis upon the\r\nsolid phlegm and conservatism of its rural districts where men are too\r\nbusy with productive labor to scheme for political office or unearned\r\nwealth. In other words, and I speak it with sincerity, the rural\r\npopulation conserves the real dependable life blood of this nation. It\r\nis an accepted fact that in every crisis of our country's history the\r\nrural population was not only on the side of right, but ready to defend\r\nthe nation's honor with their votes or with their blood.\r\n\r\nWhen the nation's debt was appalling and money poured into the national\r\ntreasury in but feeble currents, the tariffs that replenished it again\r\nwere borne like a young Hercules by the farming class, though they\r\nreceived but a minimum of its protection. Every influence, therefore,\r\nthat tends to exalt agriculture as a profession, and farming as a\r\ndesirable mode of life, whether it be intellectual, political, ethical\r\nor spiritual, is for the general welfare.\r\n\r\nThe time is not far distant, let us hope and pray, when agriculture will\r\ncast off the thralldom of the ages and assert her own. But not until the\r\nsons and daughters of the country, trained for rural social and\r\nindustrial service, as you are being trained, assert an aggressive\r\nleadership, with genuine patriotism for the needs of the open country,\r\nwill the domination of ulterior interests be removed and agriculture\r\nmade free to manage its educational institutions and business affairs,\r\nin part at least, for its own good.\r\n\r\n_The Rural School Problem._ Since education is the governing factor,\r\nespecially so far as it directs the attitude of rural children toward\r\nrural conditions, the country school should be so redirected and\r\nrevitalized as to \"stir into action community forces which are now\r\ndormant; and to make the rural school a strong and efficient social\r\ncenter, working for the upbuilding of all the varied interests of a\r\nhealthy rural life.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The redirection of rural education means that the school is to\r\n     abandon its city ideals and standards, except as these are\r\n     adaptable to rural as well as to city schools, and to develop its\r\n     instruction with reference to its environment and the local\r\n     interests and needs. The main efforts of its instruction should be\r\n     to put its pupils into sympathetic touch with the rural life about\r\n     them, in which the great majority of them ought to find their\r\n     future homes.\"--_Cubberley._\r\n\r\nThe away-from-the-farm-influence of rural education which has in the\r\npast proved a serious handicap to rural progress and open country\r\npursuits, would thus be materially counteracted.\r\n\r\nQuoting Cubberley again:\r\n\r\n     \"The uniform text-books which have been introduced by law, were\r\n     books written primarily for the city child; the graded course of\r\n     study was a city course of study; the ideals of the school become,\r\n     in large part, city and professional in type; and the city-educated\r\n     and city-trained teachers have talked of the city, over-emphasized\r\n     the affairs of the city, and sighed to get back to the city to\r\n     teach. The subjects of instruction have been formal and\r\n     traditional, and the course of instruction has been designed more\r\n     to prepare for entrance to a city or town high school than for life\r\n     in the open country. So far as the school has been vocational in\r\n     spirit, it has been the city vocations and professions for which it\r\n     has tended to prepare its pupils, and not the vocations of the farm\r\n     and the home.\"\r\n\r\nThen says Roosevelt:\r\n\r\n     \"Our school system is gravely defective in so far as it puts a\r\n     premium upon mere literary training and tends, therefore, to train\r\n     the boy away from the farm and workshop. Nothing is more needed\r\n     than the best type of an industrial school, the school for\r\n     mechanical industries in the cities and for teaching agriculture in\r\n     the country. No growth of cities, no growth of wealth can make up\r\n     for any loss in either the number or the character of the farming\r\n     population. We of the United States should realize this above most\r\n     other people. We began our existence as a nation of farmers, and in\r\n     every crisis of the past a peculiar dependence has had to be placed\r\n     upon the farming population, and this dependence has hitherto been\r\n     justified.\"\r\n\r\n_The Rural Church Problem._ No permanent rural civilization, however,\r\ncan be maintained that will attach the population to the soil with\r\nsatisfaction and contentment without provision being made for enjoying\r\nreligious services among people of their own kind and class. This\r\nnecessitates a social and religious center for every rural community.\r\nThe church can and should be made such social center. For economic and\r\nsocial reasons, however, denominationalism can well be dispensed with,\r\nas such, and just plain Christianity substituted for sectarianism. A\r\nsocial center thus maintained will stimulate neighborly intercourse and\r\nsatisfy the demands of both young and old for religious culture, for\r\nrecreation and pastime. Where schools are consolidated the school house\r\nand grounds will answer for all gatherings whether for worship, for the\r\ndiscussion of civic or neighborhood problems or for recreation and\r\namusement. For without such neighborhood intercourse, life deteriorates\r\ninto a dull routine, and the moral and religious tone of a community,\r\ndegenerates. Moreover, under such conditions, young people become\r\ndisgusted with its monotony and aimlessness, and seek city employment.\r\n\r\nBut before the country church can be made an efficient community force,\r\npastors must be found or created that meet the conditions of country\r\nlife. A most excellent city pastor might prove to be a regrettable\r\nmisfit in a rural community. Moreover, the modern clergy seem quite as\r\nprone to herd in the towns and cities as the rest of mankind, which\r\nfact has a bad influence on the youth of the country.\r\n\r\nQuoting from Rural Life and Education: \"The rural minister needs\r\neconomic and agricultural knowledge more than theological, that he may\r\nuse the economic and agricultural experiences of his people as a basis\r\nfor the building-up of their ethical life; he needs educational\r\nknowledge, that he may direct his efforts with the young along good\r\npedagogical lines; and the church as an institution needs to study\r\ncarefully the rural-life problem, and to plan a program of useful\r\nservice along good educational and sociological lines. Unless this is\r\ndone, the church will bear but little relationship to a living\r\ncommunity; its influence on the young will be small; and its mission of\r\nmoral and religious leadership will be forgotten by the people.\"\r\n\r\n_Other Agencies for Rural Improvement._ In addition to providing country\r\nschools and employing rural school teachers as efficient as the best in\r\nthe towns, and the country church reawakened and converted into an\r\nefficient institution for progress, the Grange, farmers' clubs, the Y. M.\r\nand Y. W. C. A., the rural library, boys and girls' clubs, farmers'\r\ninstitutes, woman's clubs, literary and debating societies and amateur\r\ntheatricals, of which the Little Country Theatre is the best exponent,\r\ncan with profit be incorporated into the life of every rural community\r\nthat maintains a social center, and that takes genuine pride in making\r\ncountry life what the possibilities so readily warrant.\r\n\r\nNo one of these separate organizations, even though fully developed and\r\nearnestly supported, will altogether satisfy the needs of a community.\r\nNo one of them should be over-emphasized for its own sake alone, for\r\neach is but a part of the community need. All are needed. The friends of\r\neach, therefore, should work for all and all work for each, and becoming\r\nthus federated, they will prove to be a positive force and establish,\r\nbeyond question, a community spirit satisfactory to old and young alike.\r\n\r\nA sufficient number of these rural social institutions to meet the\r\nchanged conditions of modern life is as essential as a progressive and\r\nhighly contented agriculture; for without such institutions agriculture\r\nwill decline until on a level with the peasantry of other and less\r\nfavored countries. For just in proportion as agriculture advances or\r\ndeclines will the prosperity of the people rise or fall, and the\r\nintegrity of our government be stable or questionable. This fact has\r\nbeen clearly demonstrated in the history of nations; hence, stewardship\r\nof the soil embraces not only conservation of its fertility, but the\r\nfostering of such social institutions and educational forces as may be\r\nnecessary to support a rural civilization that will minister to all the\r\nphysical, mental and spiritual wants of a highly intellectual and\r\npermanent population. Said James A. Garfield:\r\n\r\n     \"The higher education of the village and city youth, together with\r\n     a modicum of the country youth, with only the fifth to eighth grade\r\n     for the best blood of the state may stand for the educator's\r\n     ideals, but it is bad for the country as a whole. It tends to make\r\n     aristocrats of the poorest and slaves of the best blood. Education\r\n     is for all, not for a favored few.\"\r\n\r\n_The Morrill Act._ The Morrill Act of 1862 was the first important step\r\ntoward the emancipation of agriculture. The establishment of the Land\r\nGrant Colleges was the biggest piece of constructive legislation that\r\nCongress has enacted during the past century. By means of higher\r\neducation thus redirected and vitalized, industrial independence will\r\nultimately be realized. But the work moves slowly. However, in spite of\r\nridicule and unmerited handicaps, and even the contempt of too many of\r\nthe farming class, these institutions have grown steadily in influence\r\nand power.\r\n\r\nThe North Dakota Agricultural College directs its energies toward a\r\nsystem of education that at once affords all the means of culture and\r\ncharacter building that collegiate courses of study can offer, yet\r\nwithout departing materially from giving special emphasis to those\r\nsubjects which are directly related to the homes and the chief industry\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is not only to increase production as a means of profit and\r\nto render helpful social service, but to make farm life and rural\r\nconditions so agreeable and satisfying that the choice of agricultural\r\npursuits, on the part of educated young people, will prove as popular\r\nand inviting as that of any other industry or profession. This is not an\r\nimpossibility. From an educational view-point no vocation exceeds\r\nagriculture in the material available for calling out the best there is\r\nin man, spiritually or intellectually. From a social view-point, the\r\ncountry represents the purest and most neighborly sympathies. And from\r\nan industrial view-point it is the state's support and should be the\r\nstate's pride. North Dakota will expand in wealth and influence,\r\ntherefore, in proportion as she throws wide open the door of\r\nagricultural opportunity for the young people of the state. This she can\r\nbest accomplish by means of public education expressed in terms of rural\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty years of service as President of your Agricultural College,\r\nI find that my chief gratification comes from having associated daily\r\nwith a loyal and dependable faculty and with so many clean, ambitious\r\nand sympathetic young men and women.\r\n\r\nIn you and the thousands of Agricultural College students scattered over\r\nthis and adjoining states, many of them having already won enviable\r\ndistinction by their public services, and all giving evidence of most\r\nexemplary citizenship, I not only take sincere pride but also find my\r\nchief reward. Others may scheme for wealth or fame, but for one at my\r\ntime in life, I would not exchange the friendship of the Agricultural\r\nCollege student body, past and present, for earthly riches or personal\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nI have implicit faith in the future of our Agricultural College as I\r\nhave in this great agricultural state. Her broad acres are being rapidly\r\noccupied by a progressive and enterprising husbandry. Her cities and\r\nvillages keep pace with her rural development. The dreams of the\r\npioneers are fast becoming realities. The erstwhile home of the red\r\nman and the feeding ground of the bison, are destined soon to be thickly\r\ndotted over with luxurious farmsteads, made beautiful by the arts of\r\ncivilization and prosperous by the skill and industry of a happy and\r\ncontented rural population.\r\n\r\nStudents of the Agricultural College, your mission lies in this\r\ndirection. Your influence upon the future development of this state will\r\nbe as certain as it will be beneficient. The door of opportunity stands\r\najar, inviting you to enter and share the blessings that reward the\r\nindustrious and reap the honors that crown the lives of those whose\r\nstewardship has been faithfully kept. May no temptation ever swerve you\r\nfrom loyalty to the cause which your alma mater represents. Too often\r\nthe enemies of industrial freedom capture with the blandishments of\r\nvanity, the trusted leaders of reform.\r\n\r\nLet your hearts, therefore, ever beat true for the best there may be in\r\nstore for those whose sweat fertilizes the business of the state. The\r\ncause of the people should ever be your cause, and having received your\r\neducation largely at their expense, spare not a generous service in\r\nreturn for the academic honors that now await you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Stewardship of the Soil, by John Henry Worst",
