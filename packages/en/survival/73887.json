Proud as they were of\r\nthe Navy’s achievements in the past, they failed for a long time to\r\nexhibit any interest in its present or future, and met all claims\r\nfor its re-establishment by a denial of its usefulness, or by a\r\nlazy optimism of indifference which smilingly put the question by.\r\nIndeed, at one time, the popular solicitude disappeared completely,\r\nand outside of the service there was manifested neither an alarm at\r\nits degeneracy nor an appreciation of the dangers this made possible.\r\nWith an apathy inexplicable upon any rational grounds, the notes\r\nof warning sounded by experts were unheeded, and the law-makers\r\ncontented themselves by pinning their faith to what they called\r\n“the creative possibilities of American genius.” They accepted this\r\nfallacy as a fact, they made this phrase a fetich, and with a fatuous\r\nhope believed it could, by some occult inspiration, in the event of\r\nsudden, sharp, and short war, save them from the fighting-machines\r\nwhich twenty years of tireless experiment had perfected abroad. In\r\nthe end, by a neatly balanced policy of pride and folly, the Navy\r\nwas exhausted almost to dissolution. Then Congress lazily bestirred\r\nitself to action, and prescribed as a remedy three unarmored cruisers\r\nand a despatch-boat.\r\n\r\nHeroic treatment, not homœopathy, was needed; but, thanks to a\r\nnaturally vigorous constitution, the bolus sufficed to lift the\r\npatient out of the throes, and to encourage him into a languid\r\nconvalescence. Luckily, the vessels became a party question, and\r\ntheir historic tribulations did so much towards educating the\r\nnation that a public sentiment was aroused which made a modern navy\r\npossible. It must be confessed, however, that the demand even yet is\r\nnot so vociferous as to dominate all other issues, though there is\r\napparent everywhere a quickening desire for the country to take, if\r\nnot the first, at least a respectable, place among the great maritime\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nWith these new ideas came a desire for information which could not be\r\nsatisfied, because, curiously enough, the popular literature of the\r\nsubject is meagre, or rather it is unavailable. There are treatises\r\nin plenty which soar beyond the skies of any but experts; there are\r\nhandy manuals wherein the Navy, like the banjo, is made easy in ten\r\nlessons; but between these extremes nothing exists which is accurate,\r\nand at the same time free from those dismal figures and dry-as-dust\r\nfacts that are so apt to discourage a reader at the outset.\r\n\r\nTo meet this want, which was one by no means “long felt,” these\r\narticles were originally published in _Harper’s Magazine_, and with a\r\nsuccess that seemed to justify their collection in a more available,\r\nif not a more permanent, form. It may be said now that no changes of\r\nany moment have been made in the text, that the notes attempt only to\r\nbring down the data to the latest date, and that the appendices are\r\nneedful additions which the limited space of a monthly publication\r\nnecessarily forbade. The reader who has not followed the progress of\r\nnaval war construction will undoubtedly find many surprises, both in\r\nachievement and promise, which may be difficult to understand, yet\r\nit is hoped that the non-technical manner in which Sir Edward Reed\r\nand Rear-admiral Simpson have written will do much to make plain this\r\nimportant National question. Both these gentlemen are authorities\r\nof the first rank, both are luminous writers, and each in his own\r\ncountry and own sphere has had an important influence upon war-ship\r\ndesign and armament. To those who read within the lines there awaits\r\na mortifying realization of our inferiority; for during all the\r\nyears that this country—masterful beyond compare in other material\r\nstruggles—was so successfully neglecting its navy, foreign designers\r\nwere achieving triumphs which are marvellous. With this knowledge\r\nthere is sure to come a high appreciation of the intelligence\r\nexercised; for the evolution of the battle-ship has been so rapid,\r\nand the resultant type has so little in common with the wooden vessel\r\nof our war, that those who have solved the problems have practically\r\ncreated a new science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n  INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER                                               1\r\n\r\n  THE BRITISH NAVY                                                  12\r\n      NOTES                                                         52\r\n\r\n  THE FRENCH NAVY                                                   67\r\n      NOTES                                                         92\r\n\r\n  THE ITALIAN, RUSSIAN, GERMAN, AUSTRIAN, AND TURKISH NAVIES       104\r\n      NOTES                                                        134\r\n          Italy                                                    134\r\n          Russia                                                   139\r\n          Spain                                                    141\r\n          Austria                                                  144\r\n\r\n  THE UNITED STATES NAVY                                           148\r\n      NOTES                                                        183\r\n\r\n  UNITED STATES NAVAL ARTILLERY                                    194\r\n      NOTES                                                        226\r\n          Guns                                                     226\r\n          Machine and Rapid-fire Guns                              234\r\n\r\n  SHIPS OF THE MINOR NAVIES                                        241\r\n\r\n  APPENDIX I                                                       251\r\n      SUBMARINE WARFARE                                            251\r\n      TORPEDOES                                                    259\r\n      A NAVAL RESERVE                                              261\r\n      FORCED DRAFT                                                 263\r\n\r\n  APPENDIX II                                                      267\r\n      THE QUESTION OF TYPES                                        267\r\n\r\n  APPENDIX III                                                     283\r\n      RANGE OF GUNS                                                283\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR, OCTOBER 21, 1805.—From\r\n      a drawing by J.

Between the wooden vessel of 1857 and the metal machine\r\nof 1887 there exist in common only the essential principles that\r\neach is a water-borne structure, armed with guns and propelled by\r\nsteam. Beyond this everything is changed—model, material, machinery,\r\nrig, armament, equipment. In truth, so radical are the differences,\r\nand so sudden have been the developments, that authorities are\r\nwidely separated in opinion, even upon such a primary question as\r\na universally accepted system of classification. But as this is\r\nnecessary to a proper appreciation of the subject, a generalization\r\nmay be made in which war-vessels are divided into armored and\r\nunarmored types, the former including battle-ships, and the latter\r\nthose employed in the police of the seas, in commerce protection or\r\ndestruction, or in the attack of positions which are defenceless.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any accepted differentiations of these classes, the\r\nnew British nomenclature may be adopted with safety, for to a certain\r\ndegree it explains the terms and includes the types now used so\r\nvariously in different navies. Under this armored vessels are grouped\r\ninto (1) battle-ships, (2) cruisers, (3) special types, such as rams\r\nand torpedo-boats, and (4) coast-service ships; and unarmored vessels\r\ncomprise (1) cruisers, (2) sloops, (3) gun-vessels, (4) gun-boats,\r\n(5) despatch-vessels, and (6) torpedo-vessels. “As it was impossible\r\nto unite all the qualities which are to be desired in a ship-of-war\r\nin a single vessel, it became necessary to divide the leading types\r\ninto subdivisions, each specially adapted to the use of a particular\r\narm, or to perform some special service. For the battle-ships\r\ndesigned for naval operations in European waters great offensive and\r\ndefensive powers and evolutionary qualities are essential, while\r\nthe highest sea-going qualities, including habitability, are, in the\r\nopinion of some, less essential. For sea-going battle-ships offensive\r\nand defensive strength must be partially sacrificed in order to\r\nsecure unquestionable sea-worthiness. In ocean-going battle-ships\r\ncanvas is a valuable auxiliary. In battle-ships for European\r\nwaters, masts and yards involve a useless sacrifice of fighting\r\npower.... Heavily armored ships intended for the line of battle\r\nmust necessarily carry powerful guns. They must be able to traverse\r\ngreat distances, and must therefore have considerable storage for\r\ncoal. Great speed is required to enable them to meet the inevitable\r\ncontingencies of an engagement. In a word, the class of ships which\r\nmay be called battery-ships must be furnished with very considerable\r\noffensive and defensive power. Their great size, however, and the\r\nenormous weight of their armor and armament, necessitate such\r\ndisplacements as render them unfit for coast defence” (BRASSEY).\r\n\r\nWhile the antagonistic elements of offence, defence, speed, or\r\nendurance have caused the main differences of design in all\r\ntypes, the greatest variances with battle-ships are found in the\r\ndistribution of armor for protection. A hasty summarization of the\r\npolicies now adopted by the great maritime nations shows that the\r\nFrench generally adhere to a complete armor-belt at the water-line,\r\nthat the Italians have in their latest ships totally abandoned\r\nside-armor, and that the English favor its partial employment. The\r\npopular idea that armor consists only of thick slabs of wrought-iron\r\nor steel, or of steel-faced iron, bolted to a ship’s side, is\r\nerroneous. “In the earlier broadside ships,” writes the present\r\ndirector of English naval construction, Mr. W. H. White, “this view\r\nwas practically correct; they had no armor or protected decks,\r\nthe decks being covered only by thin plates fitted for structural\r\npurposes. But in the _Devastation_ class, and all subsequent ships,\r\nconsiderable and increasing weights of material are worked into the\r\ndeck armor, and with good reason. Experiments showed conclusively\r\nthat horizontal protection at the top of the armor-belt, or citadel,\r\nwas of vital necessity, and even now (1887) it is open to question\r\nwhether the provision made for horizontal protection in relation to\r\nvertical armor is as large as it might advantageously be.”\r\n\r\nThe factors which have most influenced the problem are the torpedo,\r\nram, and gun. Of these the last is indubitably of the highest\r\nimportance, for the number and nature, the effective handling, the\r\ndisposition and command, and the relative protection of the guns are\r\nthe elements which control most powerfully the principles of ship\r\ndesign. In the first stage of the contest between gun and armor the\r\ndefence was victorious, but so rapidly have the art and science of\r\nordnance developed that to-day the power of the heaviest pieces as\r\ncompared with the resistance of the heaviest armor is greater than\r\never before.\r\n\r\nThe story of the contest can be briefly told. In 1858 the armament of\r\nthe newest ships was principally a broadside battery of 32-pounders;\r\nin this were included a few 56-pound shell-guns and one or two\r\neight-inch 68-pounders, though of the whole number not one had\r\nan energy, that is, a force of blow when striking, sufficient to\r\npenetrate four and a half inches of wrought-iron at short range.\r\nIn the earliest iron-clads—the French _La Gloire_ and the English\r\n_Warrior_—batteries mainly of nine-inch calibre were carried, the\r\nlatter mounting forty guns of all kinds. The _Minotaur_, the first\r\nrepresentative of the next English type, had fifty guns, but after\r\nthis class was launched there appeared that distinctively modern\r\ntendency to decrease the number of pieces while increasing the\r\nintensity of their fire. The succeeding vessels carried from fourteen\r\nto twelve pieces, until, in 1874, the principle of concentration\r\nreached its maximum in giving the _Inflexible_ only four guns.\r\nThese, like the _Warrior’s_, were muzzle-loaders, and their relative\r\ndimensions and power may be compared as follows:\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n  |                                |  _Warrior._    |  _Inflexible._   |\r\n  +--------------------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n  | Weight of gun                  | 4¾ tons.       | 80 tons.         |\r\n  | Length                         | 10 feet.       | 26 feet 9 inches.|\r\n  | Calibre                        |  8 inches.     | 16 inches.       |\r\n  | Powder charge                  | 16 pounds.     | 450 pounds.      |\r\n  | Weight of projectile           | 68    ”        | 1700  ”          |\r\n  | Energy at 1000 yards           | 452 foot-tons. | 26,370 foot-tons.|\r\n  | Penetration of 4½ inches of    |                |                  |\r\n  |   wrought-iron at short range  | None.          |    ...           |\r\n  | Penetration of wrought-iron at |                |                  |\r\n  |   1000 yards                   |     ...        | 23 inches.       |\r\n  +--------------------------------+----------------+------------------+\r\n\r\nThe term energy, when employed to indicate the work that a gun\r\ncan perform, is expressed in foot-tons, and signifies that the\r\namount developed is sufficient to raise the given weight in tons to\r\nthe height of one foot. The piercing power of the _Inflexible’s_\r\nprojectile was, under the same conditions of charge and range,\r\nsufficient to penetrate twenty-five feet of granite and concrete\r\nmasonry, or thirty-two feet of the best Portland cement.\r\n\r\nWhen the thickness of armor-plating increased, gun-makers tried\r\nto overcome the resistance by giving greater energy to the shot.\r\nAs this required large charges of powder and very long guns,\r\nmuzzle-loaders became impracticable on shipboard, and were supplanted\r\nby breech-loaders. From this stage guns developed greatly in power\r\nuntil, in 1882, those designed for the _Benbow_ were to weigh 110\r\ntons, to be 43 feet long and 16¾ inches in calibre, and with 900\r\npounds of powder and an 1800-pound projectile were to develop 54,000\r\nfoot-tons, or an energy sufficient to penetrate thirty-five inches\r\nof unbacked wrought-iron at one thousand yards. The guns for the\r\nlatest English ships, the _Trafalgar_ and the _Nile_, weigh 67 tons,\r\nare 36 feet 1 inch in length and 13½ inches in calibre, and with a\r\n520-pound charge and a 1250-pound projectile are expected to develop\r\n29,500 foot-tons, or an energy sufficient to penetrate an iron target\r\ntwenty-two and a half inches thick at a thousand yards. These results\r\napparently show a retrogression in power, but a comparison of the\r\n_Inflexible’s_ and _Trafalgar’s_ batteries proves that the more\r\nmodern gun of the latter weighs 13 tons less, is 2½ inches smaller in\r\ncalibre, fires a shot 450 pounds lighter, and yet develops an energy\r\ngreater by 3000 foot-tons.\r\n\r\nThis gain is mainly due to the improvements made with powder and\r\nprojectiles. In 1883 a 403-pound Whitworth steel shell penetrated\r\na wrought-iron target eighteen inches thick backed by thirty-seven\r\ninches of well-packed wet sand, one and a half inches of steel,\r\nvarious balks of timber, and sixteen feet more of sand. When the\r\nprojectile was recovered after this stratified flight it was found\r\nto be practically uninjured. On the Continent, where breech-loaders\r\nwere favored earlier than in England or with ourselves, the heaviest\r\nrifles afloat are the 75-ton, 16.54-inch calibre, French, and the\r\n106 tons, 17-inch Italian guns. These are, however, not the largest\r\npieces designed, for there is an 120-ton Krupp gun, and the French\r\nhave projected one which will weigh 124 tons, be 18.11 inches in\r\ncalibre, and fire a 2465-pound projectile—over a ton—with a powder\r\ncharge of 575 pounds. A comparison of the Krupp 120-ton gun with the\r\n110-ton Armstrong shows that the former is more powerful; that its\r\nprojectile is much heavier, and the initial velocity and pressure are\r\nsmaller. The results at the recent test were as follows:\r\n\r\n                     Armstrong.          Krupp.\r\n  Charge            850 pounds         847 pounds.\r\n  Shot             1800   ”           2315   ”\r\n  Velocity         2150 feet          1900 feet.\r\n  Pressure         19.9 tons          18.8 tons.\r\n  Energy           57,679 foot-tons   67,928 foot-tons.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Warrior_ to the _Inflexible_ the evolution of design\r\nwas based upon a principle that sought the best results for the\r\noffence in small, powerful batteries, with all-around fire and armor\r\nprotection; and for the defence, in thick armor carried over the\r\nvitals of the ship. This was satisfied by larger weights of armor and\r\na smaller ratio of armored part to total surface. Wrought-iron armor\r\nwas also replaced by compound, with a corresponding gain of twenty\r\nper cent. for equal thicknesses, and at present all-steel plates, of\r\nwhich great things may reasonably be expected, are now employed by\r\nFrance and Italy. In 1861 the _Minotaur_ was belted throughout her\r\n400 feet of length with 1780 tons of armor, or with a weight nearly\r\ndouble that given to the _Warrior_ two years before. The _Inflexible_\r\nhas 3280 tons, and the _Trafalgar_ 4230 tons, of which 1040 are\r\nfitted horizontally. The maximum thickness of the _Warrior’s_\r\nwrought-iron armor is 4½ inches, of the _Devastation’s_, 12 inches,\r\nand of the _Inflexible’s_ 24 inches; the compound (iron steel-faced)\r\narmor of the _Trafalgar_ is 18 and 20 inches thick, and the _Baudin_\r\nand _Formidable_ have 21.7 inches in solid plates of steel. These, of\r\ncourse, are some of the dry-as-dust figures before referred to, and\r\nthey are cited only to assist a comparison, their mere enumeration\r\nhaving no scientific value, because the disposition and character of\r\nthe plates are unconsidered.\r\n\r\nTo meet this development of offence and defence many changes in\r\ndesign have been adopted. The _broadside system_ of the first armored\r\nships was followed in 1863-1867 by a _belt and battery type_,\r\nwherein the principal guns, much reduced in number, were carried in\r\na box battery amidships, and given a fore-and-aft fire by means of\r\nrecessed ports or outlying batteries. In 1869 the Admiralty adopted\r\nthe _breastwork monitor_, a low free-boarded structure, which was\r\nplated from stem to stern in the region of the water-line, and had in\r\nits central portion an armored breastwork that carried at each end a\r\nrevolving turret. In 1870 this type was pronounced unsafe, and after\r\na careful investigation by a special committee on design certain\r\nmodifications were recommended. These did not affect materially\r\nthe essential features of Sir Edward Reed’s plan, for the complete\r\nwater-line belt and the central armored battery were retained; and\r\nto-day many of the critics who then denounced it claim that, after\r\nall, it is the true type of an ideal battle-ship.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the Italian naval authorities accepted the conclusions of\r\nthe British committee, and laid down the first _central-citadel_\r\nbattle-ships, now known as the _Duilio_ and _Dandolo_; and about the\r\nsame time Mr. Barnaby, the new Chief Constructor of the British Navy,\r\nbrought forward a similar design in the _Inflexible_. The engines,\r\nboilers, and the bases of two turrets in this vessel are protected\r\nby an armored box-shaped citadel, from the extremities of which a\r\nhorizontal armored deck extends fore and aft below the water-line;\r\nabove this deck an armored superstructure completes the free-board,\r\nand has its unprotected spaces at the water-line, subdivided into\r\nnumerous water-tight compartments. This ship met with so much hostile\r\ncriticism that a committee was appointed to investigate the charges,\r\nbut in the end the Admiralty plans were officially sustained.\r\n\r\nThe French, with characteristic ability and independence, have in\r\nthe mean time made many notable departures from their first types\r\nof broadside ships. Believing in the association of heavy guns with\r\nlight ones—mixed armaments, as they are called—the central armored\r\ncasemate of wholly protected guns has been rejected in order to give\r\na maximum thickness of plating at the water-line. The largest guns\r\nare mounted _en barbette_—that is, in towers which protect the gun\r\nmechanism, and permit the pieces to be fired, not through port-holes,\r\nbut over the rim of armored parapets. The French constructors reason,\r\nand with justice, that no single shot from a heavy gun should be\r\nwasted, and that, in addition to an extended range, gun captains must\r\nbe enabled, by keeping their eyes upon the enemy, to select the best\r\nopportunity for firing. With broadside pieces this is impossible, for\r\napart from the limited range, and the obscurity caused by the smoke,\r\nthe port-holes through which the sighting has necessarily to be done\r\nare almost choked by the gun-muzzles. Turrets have their objections\r\nalso, because the poisonous gases which formerly escaped wholly from\r\nthe muzzle will, as soon as the breech is opened, rush into the\r\nturret and make it almost uninhabitable. Often after one discharge\r\nthe air becomes stifling, and in the _Duilio_ it deteriorated\r\nso quickly as to be unfit for respiration until a part of the\r\nturret-roof had been lifted. Then, again, structural difficulties\r\nnot easily overcome in the turret are simplified in the barbette, as\r\nthe latter, with equal gun facilities, weighs fifty per cent. less,\r\nand at the same time escapes all those chances of disablement which\r\na well-placed shot is almost sure to cause in any revolving system.\r\nAt sea the chance of hitting the gun is never great, and the main\r\nthings to protect are the gun machinery and the gunners; the armored\r\nwall of the barbette tower does this for the former, and the latter\r\nhave a fair fighting chance afforded by the gun-shield. Of course war\r\nis not deer-stalking, and the patriot who wants to go into battle so\r\nfully protected as to be in no danger had better stop playing sailor\r\nor soldier, and take to the woods before the fighting begins. In\r\naddition to the heavy ordnance, the French mount a number of lighter\r\npieces, and carry powerful secondary batteries of rapid fire and\r\nmachine-guns; and sufficient armor defence is given by a belt at\r\nthe water-line, an armored deck, and a glacis and parapet for the\r\nbarbette. It is quite probable that these purely military terms may\r\nseem odd when applied to ships, but they are the only ones which can\r\nexactly explain what is meant, and, after all, they show how much a\r\nbattle-ship has become a floating, transferable fortress.\r\n\r\nThe Italians were not altogether satisfied with the _Duilio_, as she\r\nlacked the high speed and coal endurance which they deem essential\r\nin any Mediterranean naval policy; so in 1878 they adopted an idea\r\nadvanced some years before in England, and startled the world with\r\nthe _Italia_ type. In this ship protection is given, not by vertical\r\nor side armor, but by an armored deck, between which and the deck\r\nabove there is a very minute subdivision of the water-line space.\r\nThe system is based upon the theory that the power to float must\r\nbe obtained, not by keeping our projectiles, but by so localizing\r\ntheir effect as to make any penetration practically harmless. The\r\n_Italia’s_ heavy guns are carried in a central armored redoubt, at\r\na height of thirty-three feet above the water-line, and with their\r\nmachinery and fittings weigh over two thousand tons. This fact\r\nshows the magnitude of the task accepted by her designer, for it\r\nmeans that a load nearly equal to the total weight of a first-class\r\nline-of-battle ship of the last century has to be sustained at\r\nthis great elevation. Besides the main battery of four 106-ton\r\nguns, eighteen six-inch breech-loading guns are carried—twelve in\r\nbroadside on the upper battery deck, four in the superstructure\r\nbefore and abaft the redoubt, and two under cover at the extremities\r\nof the spar-deck. The redoubt is protected by seventeen inches of\r\ncompound iron, inclined twenty-four degrees from the vertical; and\r\nthe complete armored deck, which is nearly three inches thick, dips\r\nforward to strengthen the ram, curves aft to cover the steering gear,\r\nand, at the ship’s sides, extends six feet below the water-line.\r\n\r\nTo cope with this formidable rival, which, whether right or wrong\r\nin principle, must, under England’s policy, be surpassed, the ships\r\nof the _Admiral_ class were designed. In these the main battery\r\nis mounted in two barbettes built high out of water, near the\r\nextremities of the vessel, while in a central broadside are carried\r\nthe armor-piercing and rapid-fire guns. The engines, boilers, and\r\nbarbette communications are protected by a water-line belt of thick\r\narmor which covers about forty-five per cent. of the ship’s length;\r\nat the upper edge of this there is a protective deck, and at its ends\r\nathwartships bulkheads are erected; before and abaft the belt and\r\nbeneath the water-line there is a protective deck, together with the\r\nusual minute subdivision into water-tight compartments. The barbettes\r\nand the cylindrical ammunition tubes which extend from the belt-deck\r\nto the barbette floors are strongly armored. Owing to the strong\r\nprotest made against these vessels, more efficient armor protection\r\nhas been given to the battle-ships lately laid down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this very hasty and incomplete review it may be gathered\r\nthat the first and most lasting influence in the development of\r\nbattle-ships is due to France and England, though the _Monitor_\r\nhad no little share in the result. It is difficult to say, in the\r\nceaseless struggle for something which, if not good, is new, what may\r\nbe the outcome of the latest efforts to revolutionize the question,\r\nor, curiously enough, to bring it back to the point whence its\r\ndeparture was taken. Whatever may be the courage of one’s opinion,\r\nthere is not sufficient data—a first-class war can only supply\r\nthese—upon which to say, Yea, yea! or Nay, nay! and prophecy is\r\ncertain to be without honor, especially as the discussions given in\r\nthe appendices demonstrate how the wisest and most experienced have\r\nno substantial agreement in views.\r\n\r\nAn editorial in a late number of the _Broad Arrow_ declares that “the\r\ndays of armored plate protection are, in the opinion of many thinking\r\nmen, coming to a close. The gun is victorious all along the line, and\r\nthe increased speed given to the torpedo-boat, taken in conjunction\r\nwith the destructive efficiency attained by the torpedo, makes it a\r\nquestionable policy to spend such large sums of money as heretofore\r\nupon individual ships.” There is no room here to give the various\r\narguments, though very clever and ingenious they are, by which this\r\nposition is fortified; it may be added, however, that to a large\r\ndegree this is the opinion of Admiral Aube, the late French Minister\r\nof Marine, and undoubtedly this declaration re-echoes the shibboleth\r\nof those other French officers who, in the absolute formula of their\r\nchief, Gabriel Charmes, insist that “a squadron attacked at night by\r\ntorpedo-boats is a squadron lost.”\r\n\r\nEnglish authorities, with a few notable exceptions, do not go so\r\nfar as their more impulsive, or, from the Gallic stand-point, less\r\nconservative neighbors. Chief Constructor White believes that at\r\nno time in the war between gun and armor has the former, as the\r\nprincipal fighting factor, so many chances of success. He concedes\r\nthe value of light, quick-firing guns in association with heavy\r\narmaments, grants the importance of rams, torpedoes, submarine boats,\r\nand torpedo-vessels generally, but denies that the days of heavily\r\narmored battle-ships are ended. Lord Charles Beresford asserts that\r\nthe value of large guns at sea is overestimated, advocates from\r\nmotives of morals and efficiency mixed armaments, agrees to the\r\ngreat, yet subordinate, importance of the usual auxiliaries, and\r\ninsists that England builds cumbersome and expensive battle-ships\r\nonly because of their possession by her dangerous rivals.\r\n\r\nThere are equally rigorous disagreements upon all the other types\r\nof armored, unarmored, and auxiliary vessels, as needs must be, so\r\nlong as the naval policies of no two nations can be alike. England\r\nand Russia are at opposite poles, so far as their environments are\r\nconcerned, and between France and Turkey the differences are as\r\nradical as their national instincts and ambitions. But, among all,\r\nEngland is as isolated as her geographical situation. Whatever fleets\r\nother nations may assemble, whatever types other countries may deem\r\nbest for their interests, England, whose existence depends upon her\r\nnaval strength, must have all; not only the best in quality, but so\r\nmany of every class that she will be able to defend her integrity\r\nagainst any foe that assails it. England can take no chances.\r\n\r\nUpon one point alone, the necessity of high speed, is there\r\nsubstantial agreement. Less than four years ago fifteen or sixteen\r\nknots were accepted as a maximum beyond which profitable design could\r\nnot be urged. Greater speed, it is true, had been attained by our\r\nfirst type of commerce destroyer. In February, 1868, the _Wampanoag_\r\nran at the rate of 16.6 knots for thirty-eight hours, and made a\r\nmaximum of 17.75 knots; but great as was the achievement, there is a\r\ngeneral acceptance of the fact that this vessel was a racing-machine,\r\nand not in the modern sense a man-of-war.\r\n\r\nFighting-ships, with the power to steam thousands of miles at sea\r\nwithout recoaling, are now being built under contracts which, for\r\nevery deficiency in speed or horse-power, pay penalties that at\r\nour former summit of expectations would have been prohibitive to\r\nship construction; and, what is more startling yet, the bonus which\r\ngoes to any increase upon this speed proves the co-relation between\r\nscientific attainment and popular appreciation of the subject, and\r\nshows how readily the impossibilities of yesterday become the axioms\r\nof to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe development of speed has therefore a special interest.\r\nBetween 1859 and 1875, that tentative period which led to such\r\nwonderful realizations, the highest speed, under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, of large war-vessels was fourteen knots; in the\r\nsmaller classes of unarmored ships it ranged between eight and\r\nthirteen, while that attained by fast cruisers was from fifteen\r\nto sixteen and a half knots. In 1886 Italian armored vessels\r\nmade eighteen knots. Cruisers like the Japanese _Naniwa-Kan_ and\r\nthe Italian _Angelo Emo_ reached nearly nineteen, and the _Reina\r\nRegente_, launched in February last, is expected to steam over\r\ntwenty. Torpedo-vessels beginning in 1873 with fourteen knots are\r\nnow running twenty-five, and at the same time the type has so much\r\nincreased in size and importance as to be an essential and not an\r\naccessory in naval warfare.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to explain the difficulties which have beset this\r\ndevelopment, because the conditions that surround any attempt at\r\nspeed-increase are such as can be properly understood only by those\r\nwho have technical training; and then, too, the great ocean racers\r\nhave so much accustomed the public to wonderful sea performances that\r\nthe results are accepted without a knowledge of the credit which is\r\ndue the mechanical and marine engineers who have achieved them. But\r\nwith greater experience the higher, surely, will be the appreciation\r\nwhich every one must give; for, in the words of Chief Constructor\r\nWhite, “when it is realized that a vessel weighing ten thousand tons\r\ncan be propelled over a distance of nine knots in an hour by the\r\ncombustion of less than one ton of coal—the ten-thousandth part of\r\nher own weight—it will be admitted that the result is marvellous,”\r\nand that “‘the way of a ship in the midst of the sea’ is beyond full\r\ncomprehension.”\r\n\r\nIt is often asked which has the better fleet, France or England.\r\nWho can tell? No one definitely. Admiral Sir R. Spencer Robinson,\r\nlate Comptroller of the British Navy, declares, in the _Contemporary\r\nReview_ of February, 1887, that “the number of armored vessels of\r\nthe two countries may be stated approximately as fifty-five for\r\nEngland and fifty-one for France. Without going into further details,\r\ntaking everything into consideration, giving due weight to all the\r\ncircumstances which affect the comparison, and assuming that the\r\ndesigns of the naval constructors on each side of the Channel will\r\nfairly fulfil the intentions of each administration (a matter of\r\ninterminable dispute, and which nothing but an experiment carried to\r\ndestruction can settle), the iron-clad force of England is, on the\r\nwhole, rather superior to that of France. A combination of the navy\r\nof that Power with any other would completely reverse the position.\r\nI should state as my opinion, leaving others to judge what it may\r\nbe worth, that in fighting power the unarmored ships of England\r\nare decidedly superior to those of our rival’s; but if the _raison\r\nd’être_ of the French navy is—as has been frequently stated in that\r\ncountry, and by none more powerfully and categorically than by the\r\nFrench Minister of Marine—the wide-spread, thorough destruction of\r\nBritish commerce, and the pitiless and remorseless ransom of every\r\nundefended and accessible town in the British dominions, regardless\r\nof any sentimentalities or such rubbish as the laws of war and the\r\nusages of civilized nations; and if at least one of the _raisons\r\nd’être_ of the British navy is to defeat those benevolent intentions,\r\nand to defend that commerce on which depends our national existence\r\nand imperial greatness—then I fear that perhaps they have prepared\r\nto realize their purpose of remorseless destruction rather better\r\nthan we have ours of successful preservation.”\r\n\r\nA long sentence this, but it emphasizes the great axiom that war is\r\nbusiness, not sentiment, and teaches a lesson which this country will\r\ndo well to learn. Fortunately, we are at last out of the shallows, if\r\nnot fairly in the full flooding channel-way, though many things are\r\nyet wanting with us. Perhaps this over-long chapter cannot be made\r\nto end more usefully than by quoting in proof of this the concluding\r\nparagraph of that brilliant article on naval policy which Professor\r\nJames Russell Soley, United States Navy, contributed to the February\r\n(1887) number of _Scribner’s Magazine_:\r\n\r\n“It is the part of wisdom,” he writes, “to study the lessons of the\r\npast, and to learn what we may from the successes or the failures of\r\nour fathers. The history of the last war is full of these lessons,\r\nand at no time since its close has the navy been in a condition so\r\nfavorable for their application. At least their meaning cannot fail\r\nto be understood. They show clearly that if we would have a navy\r\nfitted to carry on war, we must give some recognition to officers\r\non the ground of merit, either by the advancement of the best, or,\r\nwhat amounts to nearly the same thing, by the elimination of the\r\nleast deserving; that we must give them a real training for war in\r\nmodern ships and with modern weapons; that the direction of the\r\nnaval establishment, in so far as it has naval direction, must be\r\ngiven unity of purpose, and the purpose to which it must be directed\r\nis fighting efficiency; that a naval reserve of men and of vessels\r\nmust be organized capable of mobilization whenever a call shall be\r\nmade; and, finally, that a dozen or a score of new ships will not\r\nmake a navy, but that the process of renewal must go on until the\r\nwhole fleet is in some degree fitted to stand the trial of modern\r\nwar. Until this rehabilitation can be accomplished the navy will\r\nonly serve the purpose of a butt for the press and a foot-ball for\r\npolitical parties and its officers—a body of men whose intelligence\r\nand devotion would be equal to any trust will be condemned to fritter\r\naway their lives in a senseless parody of their profession.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH NAVY.\r\n\r\nBY SIR EDWARD J. REED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen timber gave place to iron and steel in the construction\r\nof war-ships, the naval possibilities of Great Britain became\r\npractically illimitable. Prior to that great change the British\r\nAdmiralty, after exhausting its home supplies of oak, had to seek\r\nin the forests of Italy and of remote countries those hard, curved,\r\ntwisted, and stalwart trees which alone sufficed for the massive\r\nframework of its line-of-battle ships. How recently it has escaped\r\nfrom this necessity may be inferred from the fact that the present\r\nwriter, on taking office at the Admiralty in 1863, found her\r\nMajesty’s dockyards largely stored with recent deliveries of Italian\r\nand other oak timber of this description.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may not be inappropriate for one whose earliest\r\nprofessional studies were devoted to the construction of wooden\r\nships, but whose personal labors have been most largely devoted to\r\nthe iron era, to pay a passing tribute of respect to the constructive\r\ngenius of those great builders in wood who designed the stanch and\r\ntowering battle-ships of the good old times. Skilful, indeed, was the\r\nart, sound, indeed, was the science, which enabled them to shape,\r\nassemble, and combine thousands of timbers and planks into the _Grace\r\nde Dieu_ of Great Harry’s day (1514), the _Sovraigne of the Seas_ of\r\nCharles’s reign (1637), the _Royal William_ of half a century later\r\n(1682-92), the _Victory_, immortalized by Nelson, and in our own\r\nearly day such superb ships as the _Queen_, the _Howe_, and scores\r\nof others. Only those who have made a study of the history of sea\r\narchitecture can realize the difficulties which the designers of such\r\nstructures had to overcome.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of iron and steel for ship-building purposes\r\nthe necessity for ransacking the forests of the world for timber\r\nsuitable for the frames and beam-knees of ships passed away, and\r\nGreat Britain, which early became, and thus far remains, first and\r\ngreatest in the production of iron and steel, was thus invited to\r\nsuch a development of naval power as the world has never seen. The\r\nmercantile marine of England at the present time furnishes a splendid\r\ndemonstration of the readiness with which the commercial classes have\r\nappreciated this great opportunity; but the Royal Navy, by almost\r\nuniversal assent, supplies a melancholy counter-demonstration, and\r\nshows that neither the capabilities of a race nor the leadings of\r\nProvidence suffice to keep a nation in its true position when it\r\nfalls into the hands of feeble and visionary administrators. Any one\r\nwho will contrast the British navy of to-day with the British navy as\r\nit might and would have been under the administration, say, of such\r\na First Lord of the Admiralty as the present Duke of Somerset proved\r\nhimself in every department of the naval service five-and-twenty\r\nyears ago, will understand the recent outcry in England for a safer\r\nand more powerful fleet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “VICTORY.”\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by Symonds & Co., Portsmouth.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, as will presently appear, to describe the existing\r\nBritish navy without making reference to those administrative causes\r\nwhich have so largely and so unhappily influenced it; but the primary\r\nobject of this chapter is, nevertheless, to describe and explain it,\r\nand only such references will be made to other circumstances as are\r\nindispensable to the fulfilment of that object.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting, and to the present writer it is agreeable, in this\r\nplace, to take early note of a matter which has, perhaps, never\r\nbefore been fully acknowledged, _viz._, the indebtedness of Great\r\nBritain and of Europe to the United States for some invaluable\r\nlessons in naval construction and naval warfare which were derived\r\nfrom the heroic efforts of their great civil war. The writer is\r\nin a position to speak with full knowledge on this point, as his\r\nservice at the Admiralty, in charge of its naval construction,\r\ncommenced during the American conflict, and continued for some years\r\nafter its fortunate conclusion. There can be no doubt whatever\r\nthat from the _Monitor_ and her successors European constructors\r\nand naval officers derived some extremely valuable suggestions.\r\nThe Monitor system itself, pure and simple, was never viewed with\r\nfavor, and could never be adopted by England, except under the\r\nseverest restrictions, because the work of England has mainly to\r\nbe done upon the high seas and in distant parts of the world,\r\nand the extremely small freeboard of the _Monitor_, or, in other\r\nwords, the normal submersion of so very much of the entire ship,\r\nis highly inconvenient and not a little dangerous on sea service,\r\nas the fate of the _Monitor_ itself demonstrated. But for the work\r\nthe _Monitor_ was designed to do in inland waters she was admirably\r\nconceived, and her appearance in the field of naval warfare startled\r\nseamen and naval constructors everywhere, and gave their thoughts\r\na wholly novel direction. In saying this I am not unmindful that\r\nseven years previously England had constructed steam-propelled\r\n“floating batteries,” as they were called, sheathed with iron, and\r\nsent them to operate against the defences of Russia. But useful as\r\nthese vessels were in many respects, their construction presented\r\nno striking novelty of design, and their employment was unattended\r\nby any dramatic incidents to powerfully impress the naval mind. The\r\n_Monitor_ was both more novel and more fortunate, and opened her\r\ncareer (after a severe struggle for life at sea) with so notable\r\na display of her offensive and defensive qualities that all eyes\r\nturned to the scene of her exploits, and scanned her with a degree\r\nof interest unknown to the then existing generation of sailors and\r\nship-builders. Her form and character were in most respects singular,\r\nher low deck and erect revolving tower being altogether unexampled\r\nin steamship construction. He must have been a dull and conservative\r\nnaval architect, indeed, whose thoughts Ericsson’s wonderful little\r\nfighting ship did not stimulate into unwonted activity. But the\r\nservice rendered to Europe was not confined to the construction and\r\nexploits of the _Monitor_ itself. The coasting passages, and, later\r\non, the sea-voyages, of other vessels of the Monitor type, but of\r\nlarger size, were watched with intense interest, and gave to the\r\nnaval world instructive experiences which could in no other way have\r\nbeen acquired. Some of these experiences were purchased at the cost\r\nof the lives of gallant men, and that fact enhanced their value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GLATTON.”]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to dwell at length upon the means by which the\r\nMonitor influence took effect in the navies of Europe, but it may\r\nbe doubted whether ships like the _Thunderer_, _Devastation_, and\r\n_Dreadnought_, which naval officers declare to be to-day the most\r\nformidable of all British war-ships, would have found their way so\r\nreadily into existence if the Monitors of America had not encouraged\r\nsuch large departures from Old-world ideas. In this sense the _Times_\r\ncorrectly stated some years ago that the “American Monitors were\r\ncertainly the progenitors of our _Devastation_ type.” The one ship\r\nin the British navy which comes nearest to the American Monitor, in\r\nrespect of the nearness of her deck to the water, is the _Glatton_,\r\na very exceptional vessel, and designed under a very peculiar stress\r\nof circumstances. But even in her case, as in that of every other\r\narmored turret-ship of the present writer’s design, the base of\r\nthe turret and the hatchways over the machinery and boilers were\r\nprotected by an armored breastwork standing high above this low deck,\r\nwhereas in the American Monitors the turret rests upon the deck,\r\nwhich is near to the smooth sea’s surface.\r\n\r\nWe have here, in the features just contrasted, the expression of\r\na fundamental difference of view between the American system, as\r\napplied to sea-going turret-ships, and the European system of\r\nsea-going ships introduced by the writer. It has never been possible,\r\nin our judgment on the British side of the Atlantic, to regard even\r\nsuch Monitors as the _Puritan_ and _Dictator_ were designed to be,\r\nas sufficiently proof to sea perils. At the time when these lines\r\nwere penned the following paragraph appeared in English newspapers:\r\n“The Cunard steamer _Servia_ arrived at New York yesterday, being\r\nthree days overdue. During a heavy sea the boats, the bridge, and the\r\nfunnel were carried away, and the saloon was flooded.” Any one who\r\nhas seen the _Servia_, and observed the great height above the smooth\r\nsea’s surface at which her boats, bridge, and funnel are carried,\r\nwill be at no loss to infer why it is that we object to ships with\r\nupper decks within two or three feet only of that surface. In short,\r\nit can be demonstrated that ships of the latter type are liable, in\r\ncertain possible seas, to be completely ingulfed even to the very\r\ntops of their funnels. In the case of the _Glatton_, which had to be\r\nproduced in conformity to ideas some of which were not those of the\r\ndesigner, one or two devices were resorted to expressly in order to\r\nsecure in an indirect manner some increase of the assigned buoyancy,\r\nand thus to raise the upper deck above its prescribed height. The\r\nofficers who served in her, however, judiciously regarded her, on\r\naccount of her low deck, as fit only for harbor service or restricted\r\ncoast defence.\r\n\r\nA very dangerous combination, as the writer regards it, was once\r\nproposed for his adoption by the representative of a colonial\r\ngovernment, but was successfully resisted. This was the association\r\nof a “Coles” or English turret (which penetrates and passes bodily\r\nthrough the weather deck) with a low American Monitor deck. This was\r\nopposed on the ground that with such an arrangement there must of\r\nnecessity be great danger at sea of serious leakage around the base\r\nof the turret as the waves swept over the lower deck. It would be\r\nextremely difficult to give to the long, circular aperture around\r\nthe turret any protection which would be certain, while allowing the\r\nturret to revolve freely, both to withstand the fire of the guns and\r\nto resist the attack of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt will now be understood that while the Monitor system was from\r\nthe first highly appreciated in Europe, and more especially in\r\nEngland, it never was adopted in its American form in the British\r\nnavy. Russia, Holland, and some other powers did adopt it, and the\r\nDutch government had to pay the penalty in the total disappearance\r\nof a ship and crew during a short passage in the North Sea from\r\none home port to another. In a largely altered form, and with many\r\nmodifications and additions due to English ideas of sea service,\r\nit was, however, substantially adopted in the three powerful ships\r\nalready named, of which one, the _Dreadnought_, lately bore the flag\r\nof the British admiral who commands the Mediterranean fleet. If the\r\nopinion of officers who have served in these ships may be accepted as\r\nsufficiently conclusive, it was a great misfortune for the British\r\nnavy when the ruling features of this type of ship were largely\r\ndeparted from in its first-class ships, and made to give place to\r\na whole series of so-called first-class iron-clads, of which only\r\nabout one-third of the length has been protected by armor, and which\r\nare consequently quite unfit to take a place in any European line of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “DREADNOUGHT.”]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic differences between the American type and the\r\nEnglish type of sea-going Monitors (if we may apply that designation\r\nto the _Devastation_ type) have already been stated, but may be\r\nrestated here in a single sentence, _viz._, the elevation in the\r\nEnglish ship of the turret breastwork deck to a height of eleven or\r\ntwelve feet above the sea’s surface, and the raising of the upper\r\ndeck generally, or of a considerable part of it, to at least that\r\nheight, by means of lightly built superstructures. Over these again,\r\nand many feet above them, are built bridges and hurricane decks, from\r\nwhich the ships may be commanded in all weathers. Lofty as these\r\nships are by comparison with American Monitors, it is only gradually\r\nthat they have acquired the confidence of the naval service, so\r\nfreely do the waves sweep over their weather decks when driven, even\r\nin moderate weather, against head-seas.\r\n\r\nThe British navy, having very diversified services to perform during\r\nboth peace and war, requires ships of various kinds and sizes. Its\r\nfirst and greatest requirement of all is that of line-of-battle ships\r\nin sufficient numbers to enable England to stand up successfully\r\nagainst any European naval force or forces that may threaten her\r\nor her empire. If any one should be disposed to ask why this\r\nrequirement—which is obviously an extreme one, and an impossible one\r\nfor more than a single power—is more necessary for England than for\r\nany other country, the answer must be, _Circumspice!_ To look round\r\nover England’s empire is to see why her failure on the sea would be\r\nher failure altogether. France, Germany, Italy, and even Holland,\r\nmight each get along fairly well, losing nothing that is absolutely\r\nessential to their existence, even if every port belonging to them\r\nwere sealed by an enemy’s squadron. But were Great Britain to be cut\r\noff from her colonies and dependencies, were her ships to be swept\r\nfrom the seas, and her ports closed by hostile squadrons, she would\r\neither be deprived of the very elements of life itself, or would have\r\nto seek from the compassion of her foes the bare means of existence.\r\nIt is this consideration, and the strong parental care which she\r\nfeels for her colonies, that make her sons indignant at any hazardous\r\nreduction of her naval strength. There are even in England itself\r\nmen who cannot or will not see this danger, and who impute to those\r\nwho strive to avert it ambitious, selfish, and even sordid motives.\r\nBut it is to no unworthy cause that England’s naval anxieties are\r\ndue. We have no desire for war; we do not hunger for further naval\r\nfame; we cherish no mean rivalry of other powers who seek to colonize\r\nor to otherwise improve their trade; we do not want the mastery of\r\nthe seas for any commercial objects that are exclusively our own.\r\nWhat we desire to do is to keep the seas open thoroughfares to our\r\nvast possessions and dependencies, and free to that commercial\r\ncommunication which has become indispensable to our existence as\r\nan empire. To accomplish that object we must, at any cost, be strong,\r\nsupremely strong, in European waters; and it is for this reason that\r\nEngland’s line-of-battle ships ought to be always above suspicion\r\nboth in number and in quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “INFLEXIBLE.”]\r\n\r\nIt is not a pleasant assertion for an Englishman to make when he has\r\nto say that this is very far from being the case at present. A few\r\nmonths ago this statement, from whomsoever it emanated, would have\r\nbeen received with distrust by the general public, for the truth was\r\nonly known to the navy itself and to comparatively few outsiders.\r\nBut the official communications made to both Houses of Parliament\r\nearly in December, 1885, prepared the world for the truth, the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty in the Chamber of Peers and Lord Brassey in\r\nthe House of Commons having then proposed to Parliament a programme\r\nof additional ship-building which provided for a considerable\r\nincrease in the number of its first-class ships and cruisers, and\r\nwhich also provided, on the demand of the present writer, that the\r\ncruisers should be protected with belts of armor—an element of\r\nsafety previously denied to them. It need hardly be repeated, after\r\nthis wholesale admission of weakness by the Admiralty, that Great\r\nBritain is at present in far from a satisfactory condition as regards\r\nboth the number and the character of its ships. Were that not so,\r\nno public agitation could have moved the government to reverse in\r\nseveral respects a policy by which it had for so long abided.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to broadly but briefly review the causes of\r\nthe present deplorable condition of the British navy. In the first\r\nplace, in so far as it is a financial question, it has resulted\r\nmainly from the sustained attempt of successive governments to keep\r\nthe naval expenditure within or near to a fixed annual amount,\r\nnotwithstanding the palpable fact that every branch of the naval\r\nservice, like most other services, is unavoidably increasing in\r\ncost, while the necessities of the empire are likewise unavoidably\r\nincreasing. The consequence is that, as officers and men of every\r\ndescription must be paid, and all the charges connected therewith\r\nmust in any event be fully met, the ship-building votes of various\r\nkinds are those upon which the main stress of financial pressure\r\nmust fall. From this follows a strong desire, to which all Boards\r\nof Admiralty too readily yield, to keep down the size and cost\r\nof their first-class ships, to the sacrifice of their necessary\r\nqualities. This may be strikingly illustrated by the fact that,\r\nalthough the iron _Dreadnought_, a first-class ship, designed fifteen\r\nor sixteen years ago, had a displacement of 10,820 tons, and was\r\npowerful in proportion, the Admiralty has launched but a single ship\r\n(the _Inflexible_) since that period, of which the displacement\r\nhas reached 10,000 tons. In fact, every large iron-clad ship for\r\nthe British navy since launched has fallen from twelve hundred to\r\ntwenty-four hundred tons short of the _Dreadnought’s_ displacement,\r\nand has been proportionally feeble.\r\n\r\nIf this cutting down in the size of the principal ships of Great\r\nBritain had been attended by a corresponding reduction in the sizes\r\nof the ships of other powers, or even by some advantages of design\r\nwhich largely tended to make up for the defect of size, there might\r\nbe something to say for it. But the French ships have shown no such\r\nfalling off in size, and have benefited as fully as the English ships\r\nby the use of steel and by the improved power and economy of the\r\nmarine steam-engine.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the reduction in the size of the English ships\r\nthere has been brought about—voluntarily, and not as a consequence\r\nof reduced size, for it was first applied in the largest of all\r\nBritish men-of-war, the _Inflexible_—a system of stripping the\r\nso-called armored ships of the English navy of a large part of their\r\narmor, and reducing its extent to so deplorable a degree that, as\r\nhas already been said, they are quite unfit to take part, with any\r\nreasonable hope of success, in any general engagement. Here, again,\r\nthere might have been something to say for a large reduction in\r\nthe armored surface of ships if it had been attended by some great\r\ncompensation, such as that which an immense increase in the thickness\r\nof the armor applied might have provided, although no such increase\r\ncould ever have compensated for such a reduction of the armored part\r\nof the ship as would have exposed the whole ship to destruction by\r\nthe mere bursting in of the unarmored ends, which is what has been\r\ndone. But although in the case of the large _Inflexible_ the citadel\r\narmor was of excessive thickness, that is not true of the more\r\nrecent ships of England, the armor of which sometimes falls short of\r\nthat of the French ships, in two or three instances by as much as\r\nfour inches, the French ships having 22-inch armor, and the English\r\n18-inch. But by the combined effect of injudicious economy and of\r\nerroneous design, therefore—both furthered by a sort of frenzied\r\ndesire on the part of the British Admiralty to strip the ships of\r\narmor, keep down their speed, delay their completion, and otherwise\r\nparalyze the naval service, apparently without understanding what\r\nthey were about—the British navy has been brought into a condition\r\nwhich none but the possible enemies of the country can regard without\r\nmore or less dismay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF THE “AMIRAL DUPERRÉ.”\r\n\r\nSECTION OF THE “INFLEXIBLE.”\r\n\r\nSECTION OF THE “COLLINGWOOD.”\r\n\r\nNEW ADMIRALTY SHIP.]\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate the extent to which side armor has been denied\r\nto the British ships, as compared with the French, we refer the\r\nreader to these diagrams of the _Amiral Duperré_ (French) and of the\r\n_Inflexible_ and _Collingwood_ (both English). The black portions\r\nrepresent the side armor in each case. It is scarcely possible\r\nfor any one friendly to Great Britain to look at these diagrams,\r\nand realize what they signify, without profoundly regretting that\r\na sufficient force of public opinion has not yet been exerted to\r\ncompel the Admiralty to a much more liberal use of armor in the new\r\nfirst-class ships, the intended construction of which was announced\r\nto Parliament in December, 1885. In these new ships, while the length\r\nof the partial belt has been slightly increased, no addition to its\r\nheight above water has been made (as compared with the _Collingwood_\r\nor “Admiral” class), so that the slightest “list” towards either\r\nside puts all the armor below water. To describe such ships as\r\n“armored ships” is to convey a totally false impression of their\r\ntrue character. A side view of one of these new ships shows that the\r\ntwo principal guns are carried high up forward in an armored turret,\r\nwhich sweeps from right ahead, round the bow on each side, and well\r\ntowards the stern, while several smaller guns are carried abaft with\r\nvery thin armor protection to complete the offensive powers of the\r\nship. The arrangement of the two principal guns in a turret forward\r\nresembles that of the _Conqueror_, but in her the armor rises high\r\nabove the water, and a belt extends to the bow and nearly to the\r\nstern. It is a matter of inexpressible regret that the armored\r\nsurface of these new ships is so excessively contracted as to be\r\nwholly insufficient to preserve the ship from that terrible danger to\r\nwhich so many of their predecessors have been exposed, _viz._, that\r\nof capsizing from loss of stability when the unarmored parts alone\r\nhave been injured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “DEVASTATION.”]\r\n\r\nThere is a sense in which all the British ships to which reference\r\nhas thus far been made may be roughly regarded as developments of,\r\nor at least as starting from, the _Devastation_, or British Monitor\r\ntype of ship, for in all of them masts and sails have been done away\r\nwith, and steam propulsion relied upon, a single military mast alone\r\nremaining.[1] We have now to notice another and more numerous class\r\nof ships, which may be regarded as the lingering representatives\r\nof those sailing-ships which have come down to us through the long\r\ncenturies, but which are now rapidly disappearing, yielding to the\r\nall-prevalent power of steam. Some of these ships were built for\r\nthe line of battle, in their respective periods, but as they range\r\nin size from about one thousand tons of displacement up to nearly\r\neleven thousand tons, it is obvious that many of them were built for\r\nvarious other employments. In dealing with the full-rigged ships, we\r\nare taking account of types of war-ships which, for all but secondary\r\npurposes, are passing away. It fell to the lot of the present writer\r\n(under the rule of Mr. Childers, then First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\nand of Admiral Sir Robert Spencer Robinson, then Controller of the\r\nNavy) to introduce the mastless war-ship, and thus to virtually\r\nterminate what had certainly been for England a glorious period,\r\n_viz._, that of the taunt-masted, full-rigged, and ever-beautiful\r\nwooden line-of-battle ship. It is now, alas! but too apparent (from\r\nwhat has gone before) that in virtually terminating that period, and\r\nopening the era of the steam and steel fighting engine, we were also\r\nintroducing an era in which fantastic and feeble people might but\r\ntoo easily convert what ought to have been the latest and greatest\r\nglory of England into her direct peril, and possibly even her early\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\nThe first British iron-clad (neglecting the “floating batteries” of\r\n1854) was the _Warrior_, a handsome ship 380 feet long, furnished\r\nwith steam-power, and provided with masts, spars, and a large spread\r\nof canvas. Her ends were unprotected by armor, and her steering\r\ngear consequently much exposed. She was succeeded by a long series\r\nof full-rigged iron-clads, all of them supplied with steam-power\r\nlikewise, the series continuing down to the present time. The little\r\ndependence which is now placed in the British navy upon the use of\r\nsail-power in armored ships will be seen, however, when it is stated\r\nthat of all the ships protected by side armor which are now under\r\nconstruction in the royal dockyards, but two are to be given any\r\nsail-power at all, and these are to be rigged on two masts only,\r\nalthough the ships are of large size, and intended for cruising in\r\ndistant seas.[2]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary in a popular subject of this description to dwell\r\nupon, or even to state, the minor differences which exist between\r\nthe different types of rigged iron-clads. There are, however, some\r\npoints of interest in connection with their armor and armament\r\nto be mentioned. In the design of the first group (speaking\r\nchronologically) were commenced those changes in the disposition\r\nof the armor which continue down to the present time, the British\r\nAdmiralty being so mixed and so virtually irresponsible a body that\r\nit is not obliged to have a mind of its own for any great length of\r\ntime, even when many of the same men continue in office.\r\n\r\nThe _Warrior_, as we saw, and the sister ship _Black Prince_,\r\nhad a central armored battery only; the same is true of those\r\nreduced _Warriors_, the _Defence_ and the _Resistance_. But the\r\nnext succeeding ships of the _Warrior’s_ size, the _Minotaur_ and\r\n_Agincourt_, were fully armored from end to end; and the somewhat\r\nsmaller ship the _Achilles_ was furnished with a complete belt at\r\nthe water-line. The _Hector_ and _Valiant_ (improved _Defences_) had\r\ncomplete armor above the water, but, oddly enough, had part of the\r\nwater-line at each end left unarmored. A third ship of the _Minotaur_\r\nclass, the _Northumberland_, was modified by the present writer at\r\nthe bow and stern on his entering the Admiralty, the armor above\r\nwater being there reduced, and an armored bow breastwork constructed.\r\nWithin this armored breastwork were placed two heavy guns firing\r\nright ahead. With this exception, all these early ships, nine in\r\nnumber, were without any other protected guns than those of the\r\nbroadside.\r\n\r\nThese ships were followed by a series of rigged ships of the\r\nwriter’s design, _viz._, the _Bellerophon_, _Hercules_, _Sultan_,\r\n_Penelope_, _Invincible_, _Iron Duke_, _Vanguard_, _Swiftsure_, and\r\n_Triumph_, all with hulls of iron, or of iron and steel combined,\r\ntogether with a series of rigged ships constructed of wood, converted\r\nfrom unarmored hulls or frames, _viz._, _Enterprise_, _Research_,\r\n_Favorite_, _Pallas_, _Lord Warden_, _Lord Clyde_, and _Repulse_.\r\nEvery one of these ships was protected by armor throughout the\r\nentire length of the vessel in the region of the water-line, and\r\nin some cases the armor rose up to the upper deck. Most of them,\r\nhowever, had the armor above the belt limited to a central battery.\r\nThe chief interest in these vessels now lies in the illustrations\r\nthey furnish of the evolution, so to speak, of bow and stern fire.\r\nIn several of them a fire approximately ahead and astern (reaching\r\nto those directions within about twenty degrees) was obtained by\r\nmeans of ports cut near to the ship’s side, through the transverse\r\narmored bulkheads. In others these bulkheads were turned inward\r\ntowards the battery near the sides of the ship in order to facilitate\r\nthe working of the guns when firing as nearly ahead and astern as\r\nwas practicable. In the _Sultan_ an upper-deck armored battery was\r\nadopted for the double purpose of forming a redoubt from which the\r\nship could be manœuvred and fought in action, and of providing a\r\ndirect stern fire from protected guns. In the five ships of the\r\n_Invincible_ class a direct head and stern fire was obtained from\r\na somewhat similar upper-deck battery, which projected a few feet\r\nbeyond the side of the ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “SULTAN.”]\r\n\r\nThe rigged ships of later design than the writer’s present a still\r\ngreater variety in the disposition of their armor and armaments.\r\nThis variety may be in part illustrated by four examples, which for\r\nconvenience are principally taken from Lord Brassey’s book.[3] The\r\nscales of these small drawings, as given there, are not all the same.\r\nThese examples are the _Alexandra_, the _Téméraire_, the _Nelson_,\r\nand the _Shannon_. The _Alexandra_ (of which a separate view, in\r\nsea-going condition, is given), which is probably the best of the\r\nrigged iron-clads of the British navy, may be regarded as a natural,\r\nbut not the less meritorious, development of the combined broadside\r\nand bow and stern fire of the central-battery ships which preceded\r\nher. In her were provided a broadside battery on the main-deck, a\r\ndirect bow fire, also on that deck, and both a direct bow and a\r\ndirect stern fire on the upper deck from within armor, as in the\r\n_Invincible_ class. The guns employed for bow and stern fire were all\r\navailable for broadside fire. The upper-deck battery did not project\r\nbeyond the main-deck as in the _Invincible_ class, the forward and\r\nafter parts of the ship above the main-deck being greatly contracted\r\nin breadth in order to allow the guns to fire clear both forward and\r\naft. The _Téméraire_ is a smaller ship than the _Alexandra_, and has\r\na battery similar to hers on the main-deck, but with one gun less on\r\neach side, the danger of a raking fire entering through the foremost\r\nbattery port being met by a transverse armored bulkhead, as shown in\r\nthe plan of the ship. She is provided with an additional bow gun and\r\na stern-chaser, carried high up in barbette towers, but worked on\r\nColonel Moncrieff’s disappearing principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION AND PLAN OF THE “ALEXANDRA.”\r\n\r\nSECTION AND PLAN OF THE “TÉMÉRAIRE.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION AND PLAN OF THE “NELSON.”\r\n\r\nSECTION AND PLAN OF THE “SHANNON.”]\r\n\r\n“The _Téméraire_ fires three 25-ton guns right ahead, against two\r\n25-ton and two 18-ton guns in the _Alexandra_; on either bow, two\r\n25-ton against one 25-ton and one 18-ton; right aft, one 25-ton\r\nagainst two 18-ton; on either quarter, one 25-ton against one 18-ton;\r\non either beam, if engaged on one side at a time, two 25-ton and two\r\n18-ton, with a third 25-ton available through only half the usual\r\narc, against three 18-ton guns, with two of the same weight and one\r\nof 25-tons, each available with the limitation just described.”[4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “ALEXANDRA.”]\r\n\r\nThe _Alexandra_ is a ship of 9500 tons displacement, the _Téméraire_\r\nis of 8500 tons; after them came the _Nelson_ (to which the\r\n_Northampton_ is a sister ship), of 7320 tons displacement. This\r\nvessel cannot be regarded as an armored ship at all, in the usual\r\nsense of the word, having but a partial belt of armor, and none of\r\nher guns being enclosed within armor protection, although two guns\r\nfor firing ahead and two for firing astern are partially sheltered by\r\narmor. Even less protection than this is afforded to the guns of the\r\n_Shannon_, which also has but a partial belt of armor, and protection\r\nfor two bow guns only. The comparatively small size of the _Shannon_\r\n(5400 tons displacement) relieves her in some degree from the\r\nreproach of being so little protected; but it is difficult (to the\r\npresent writer) to find a justification for building ships of 7320\r\ntons, like the _Nelson_ and _Northampton_, and placing them in the\r\ncategory of armor-plated ships, seeing that their entire batteries\r\nare open to the free entrance of shell fire from all guns, small as\r\nwell as large. Where a ship has a battery of guns protected against\r\nfire in one or more directions, but freely exposed to fire coming in\r\nother directions, to assume that the enemy will be most likely to\r\nattack the armor, and avoid firing into the open battery, appears to\r\nbe a reversal of the safe and well-accepted principle of warfare,\r\n_viz._, that your enemy will at least endeavor to attack your\r\nvulnerable part. No doubt, when the size or cost of a particular ship\r\nis limited, the designer has to make a choice of evils, but where\r\npeople are as free as is the British Board of Admiralty to build safe\r\nand efficient ships, the devotion of so much armor as the _Nelson_\r\nand _Northampton_ carry to so limited a measure of protection is a\r\nvery singular proceeding, and illustrates once more with how little\r\nwisdom the world is governed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “TÉMÉRAIRE.”]\r\n\r\nBefore passing from the armored ships of the navy—or, rather,\r\nas we must now say, in view of some of the ships just described\r\nand illustrated, before passing from the ships which have some\r\narmor—it is desirable to take note of a few exceptional vessels\r\nwhich cannot be classed either with the pretentious and so-called\r\nline-of-battle ships or with the rigged iron-clads generally. Among\r\nthese will be found two comparatively small ships, designed by the\r\nwriter many years ago to serve primarily as rams, but to carry also\r\nsome guns. These were the _Hotspur_ and _Rupert_. The water-line\r\nof the _Hotspur_ was protected with very thick armor for her day\r\n(11-inch), extending from stem to stern, dipping down forward to\r\ngreatly strengthen the projecting ram. She carried (besides a few\r\nsmaller guns) the largest gun of the period, one of twenty-five tons,\r\nmounted on a turn-table, but protected by a fixed tower pierced with\r\nfour ports.[5] This fixed tower was years afterwards replaced by a\r\nrevolving turret, similar to that which the writer gave in the first\r\ninstance to the _Rupert_, designed soon after the _Hotspur_. Both the\r\narmor and the armament of the second vessel were heavier than those\r\nof the first, but the ram, as before, was the chief feature of the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nIt is needless here to describe some of the very early turret-ships,\r\nsuch as the _Prince Albert_, _Scorpion_, _Wyvern_, and _Royal\r\nSovereign_, all of which embodied the early (though not by any means\r\nthe earliest) views of that able, energetic, and lamented officer,\r\nthe late Captain Cowper Coles, R.N., who was lost at sea by the\r\ncapsizing of his own ship, the _Captain_, her low sides failing to\r\nfurnish the necessary stability for enabling her to resist, when\r\nunder her canvas, the force of a moderate gale of wind. Had he been\r\nable to foresee the coming abandonment of sail-power in rigged ships,\r\nand had he been placed, as the writer advised, in charge of the\r\nrevolving turrets of the navy, leaving ship-designing to those who\r\nunderstood it, he might have been alive to this day, to witness the\r\nvery general adoption in the British navy of that turret system to\r\nwhich he for some years devoted and eventually sacrificed his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “HOTSPUR.”]\r\n\r\nThe first real sea-going and successful ship designed and built to\r\ncarry the revolving turret of Coles was, by universal consent, the\r\n_Monarch_, whose sea-going qualities secured for her the distinction\r\nof transporting to the shores of America—as a mark of England’s\r\ngood-will to the people of the United States, and of her admiration\r\nof a great and good citizen—the body of the late Mr. George Peabody.\r\n“The performances of the _Monarch_ at sea,” says Brassey’s “British\r\nNavy,” “were in the highest degree satisfactory;” and nothing could\r\nexceed the frank and liberal praises bestowed upon her for her\r\nperformances during the voyage to New York by the officers of the\r\nUnited States man-of-war which accompanied her as a complimentary\r\nescort.\r\n\r\nA great deal has been written and said at different times about\r\nfour other turret-ships of the British navy, _viz._, the _Cyclops_,\r\n_Gorgon_, _Hecate_, and _Hydra_—far less terrible vessels than\r\nthese formidable names would seem to import. Whether these four\r\ncomparatively small turret-ships possess the necessary sea-going\r\nqualities for coast defence (as distinguished from harbor service) is\r\na question which has been much discussed, and is not yet settled. The\r\ntruth is that the defence of the coasts of England, Wales, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland is a service in which the sea-going qualities of vessels\r\nmay be called into requisition as largely as in any service in the\r\nworld. There are some (this writer among them) who much prefer the\r\nmid-Atlantic in a heavy gale of wind to many parts of these coasts,\r\nmore especially if there be any doubt about the perfect obedience\r\nof the ship to her steam-power and her helm. The worst weather the\r\nwriter has ever experienced at sea was met with in the English\r\nChannel, and the only merchant-ship which he ever even in part\r\npossessed was mastered by a Channel storm, had to cast anchor outside\r\nof Plymouth Breakwater, was blown clean over it, and sank inside of\r\nit, with her cables stretched across that fine engineering work. It\r\nis therefore difficult, and has always been difficult, not to say\r\nimpossible, for him to regard a “coast-defence ship,” which certainly\r\nought to be able to defend the coast, and to proceed from one part\r\nof it to another, as a vessel which may be made less sea-worthy than\r\nother vessels. Only in one respect, _viz._, that of coal supply, may\r\nsuch a ship be safely made inferior to sea-going ships.\r\n\r\nBut whether the four vessels under notice be fit for coast defence or\r\nnot, it ought to be known that they were not designed for it. They\r\nwere hastily ordered in 1870, when the Franco-German war was breaking\r\nout, under the impression that Great Britain might get involved in\r\nthat war. The British Admiralty knew then (as it knows now, and as\r\nit has known for years past) that the navy had not been maintained\r\nin sufficient strength, and it consequently seized the first design\r\nfor a small and cheap ship that it could lay hands on, and ordered\r\nthe construction, with all despatch, of four such vessels. The design\r\nwhich it happened to take, or which seemed to it most suitable, was\r\nthat of the _Cerberus_—a breastwork Monitor designed by the writer\r\nfor special service in inland colonial waters, and made as powerful\r\nas was then possible on 3300 tons of displacement, both offensively\r\nand defensively, but with no necessity for, and no pretensions\r\nwhatever to, sea-going qualities. It is scarcely to be supposed that\r\nfour vessels having such an origin could be expected to take their\r\nplace as sea-going ships of the British navy; nor could they, either,\r\nfor reasons already suggested, be expected to possess any high\r\nqualities as vessels for the defence of\r\n\r\n      “That land ’round whose resounding coasts\r\n         The rough sea circles.”\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty which ordered their construction may possibly be able\r\nto state why it built them, but even that is not at all certain. One\r\nof the evil results of mean economies in national enterprises in\r\nordinary times is extravagant and aimless expenditure in times of\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nA later example of this kind of expenditure under very similar\r\ncircumstances was furnished during Lord Beaconsfield’s\r\nadministration, when war with Russia seemed likely to occur. Again\r\nthe insufficiency of the navy was strongly felt, and again public\r\nmoney to the extent of two millions sterling or more was expended\r\nupon the acquisition of such ships as could be most readily acquired,\r\nregardless of cost. At this time the _Neptune_ (of 9170 tons\r\ndisplacement), the _Superb_ (of 9100 tons), and the _Belleisle_\r\nand _Orion_ (each of 4830 tons), were purchased into the service,\r\nand having been built for other navies, and under very peculiar\r\ncircumstances in some cases, required large dockyard expenditure to\r\nconvert them to their new uses in the British navy.\r\n\r\nIt only remains, in so far as existing armored, or rather “partly\r\narmored,” ships are concerned, to advert to the _Impérieuse_ and\r\n_Warspite_, two cruisers building for distant service. These ships\r\nare three hundred and fifteen feet long, and to them has been\r\nallowed, by the extraordinary generosity of the Admiralty, as much\r\nas one hundred and forty feet of length of armored belt. If this had\r\nbeen extended by only twenty feet, these British cruisers, which\r\nLord Brassey—whether grandiloquently or satirically it is hard to\r\nsay—calls “armored cruisers,” would have actually had one-half\r\nof their length protected by armor-plating at the water-line. In\r\nwhat spirit and with what object is not known, but Lord Brassey,\r\nin his outline sketch of these ships, writes the word “coals” in\r\nconspicuous letters before and abaft the belt. Can it be possible\r\nthat he, undoubtedly a sensible man of business, and one who\r\nlaboriously endeavors to bring up the knowledge and sense of his\r\nfellow-countrymen to a level with his own, and who was once Secretary\r\nto the British Admiralty—can it be possible that he considers coal a\r\ntrustworthy substitute for armor, either before or after it has been\r\nconsumed as fuel?\r\n\r\nIt is very distressing to have to write in these terms, and put\r\nthese questions about Admiralty representatives and Admiralty ships;\r\nbut what is to be done? Here are two ships which are together to\r\ncost nearly half a million of money, which are expressly built to\r\nchase and capture our enemies in distant seas, which are vauntingly\r\ndescribed as “armored cruisers,” which cannot be expected always by\r\ntheir mere appearance to frighten the enemy into submission, like\r\npainted Chinese forts, which must be presumed sometimes to encounter\r\na fighting foe, or at least to be fired at a few times by the stern\r\nguns of a vessel that is running away, and yet some eighty or ninety\r\nfeet of the bows of these ships, and as much of their sterns, are\r\ndeliberately deprived of the protection of armor, so that any shell\r\nfrom any gun may pierce them, let in the sea, and reduce their\r\nspeed indefinitely; and in apparent justification of this perfectly\r\nridiculous arrangement—perfectly ridiculous in a ship which is\r\nprimarily bound to sustain her speed when chasing—a late Secretary\r\nto the Admiralty tells us that she is to carry in the unprotected bow\r\nsome coals! May my hope formerly expressed in _Harper’s Magazine_\r\nfind its fruition by giving to the British Admiralty a piece of\r\ninformation of which it only can be possibly ignorant, _viz._,\r\nthat even while coal is unconsumed, it differs largely from steel\r\narmor-plates in the measure of resistance which it offers to shot\r\nand shell; and further, that coal is put on board war-ships that it\r\nmay be consumed in the generation of steam? It is very desirable\r\nthat this information should somehow be conveyed to Whitehall in an\r\nimpressive manner, and possibly, if the combined intelligence of the\r\ntwo great nations to which Harpers’ publications chiefly appeal be\r\ninvoked in its favor, it may at length be understood and attended to\r\neven by the Admiralty, and one may hear no more of the protection of\r\nher Majesty’s ships by means of their “coal.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “WARSPITE.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE “MERSEY.”]\r\n\r\nPassing now from the so-called iron-clads of the British navy, we\r\ncome to a class of vessels which have their boilers, etc., protected\r\nfrom above by iron decks sweeping over them from side to side. The\r\nsection of the _Mersey_, one of the most important British ships\r\nof this type, will illustrate the system of construction. Various\r\nattempts have been made to impose numerous ships of this kind upon a\r\nsometimes too credulous public as armored vessels, and Lord Brassey,\r\nwhile publishing descriptions and drawings which demonstrated beyond\r\nall question that the buoyancy and stability of these ships are\r\nnot at all protected by armor, nevertheless deliberately includes\r\nsome of them in his list of “armored ships.”[6] Now, the thick\r\niron deck certainly protects (in some degree, according to its\r\nthickness) all that is below it against the fire of guns, and armor\r\nitself is sometimes employed to protect the gun machinery; but the\r\nexistence of a thickish deck under the water, or mainly under the\r\nwater, occasionally associated with patches of armor above water\r\nhere and there to protect individual parts, does not constitute the\r\nship itself an armored ship in any such sense of the term as is\r\nordinarily accepted and understood. How can that be properly called\r\nan “armored ship” which can be utterly destroyed by guns without\r\nany shot or shell ever touching such armor as it possesses? The\r\nBritish Admiralty, in the “Navy Estimates” for 1883-84, under some\r\nunknown influence, put forward two ships of this description as\r\narmored vessels, and was afterwards forced to remove them from that\r\ncategory, but only removed them to place them in another not less\r\nfalse, not less misleading, not less deceptive and dangerous, _viz._,\r\nthat of “protected ships.” And this most improper description is\r\nstill applied to various ships of which the special characteristic\r\nis that they themselves are _not_ protected. If the ship’s own coal\r\nand stores may be regarded as her protection, or if the existence\r\nof a certain number of exposed and extremely thin internal plates\r\ncan be so regarded, then may these vessels be deemed partly, but\r\nonly partly, “protected;” but if “protected ship” means, as every\r\nhonest-minded person must take it to mean, that the ship herself\r\nis protected by armor against shot and shell, then the designation\r\n“protected ship,” as employed by the British Admiralty, is nothing\r\nless than an imposition. These ships are not protected. Neither their\r\npower to float, nor their power to keep upright, nor their power to\r\nexist at all, after a few such injuries as even the smallest guns\r\nafloat can inflict, is “protected,” as any war whatever is likely to\r\ndemonstrate.\r\n\r\nThose who employ such language ignore the essential characteristic\r\nof a ship-of-war, and some of the gravest dangers which menace\r\nher. It is conceivable that in the old days, when men wore armor,\r\nthe protection of the head with an “armet,” and of the breast by\r\na breastplate, might have justified the description of the man so\r\ndefended as an “armored man,” although it is difficult to see why,\r\nsince he might have been put _hors de combat_ by a single stroke.\r\nBut protect the boilers and magazines of a ship how you will, if\r\nyou do not protect the ship itself sufficiently in the region of\r\nthe water-line to prevent such an invasion of the sea as will sink\r\nor capsize her, she remains herself essentially unprotected, liable\r\nto speedy and complete destruction, and cannot truly be called a\r\n“protected ship.”\r\n\r\nIt must not for a moment be supposed that this is a mere question\r\nof words or designations. On the contrary, it is one of the most\r\nvital importance to all navies, and most of all to the navy of Great\r\nBritain. What the Admiralty says, the rest of the government, and\r\nbeyond them the country, are likely to believe and to rely upon,\r\nand when the stress of naval warfare comes, the nation which has\r\nconfidingly understood the Admiralty to mean “armored ships” and\r\n“protected ships” when it has employed these phrases, and suddenly\r\nfinds out, by defeat following defeat, and catastrophe catastrophe,\r\nthat it meant nothing of the kind, may have to pay for its credulity,\r\nallowable and pardonable as it may be, the penalty of betrayal, and\r\nof something worse even than national humility.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not to be inferred from the objections thus\r\noffered to the employment of deceptive designations that objection\r\nis also offered to the construction of some ships with limited or\r\npartial protection, falling short of the protection of the buoyancy\r\nand the stability, and therefore of the life, of the ship itself.\r\nIt is quite impossible that all the ships of a navy like that of\r\nGreat Britain, or of the navies of many other powers, can be made\r\ninvulnerable, even in the region of the water-line, to all shot or\r\nshell. Indeed, there are services upon which it is necessary to\r\nemploy armed ships, but which do not demand the use of armored or\r\nprotected vessels. Unarmored vessels, with some of their more vital\r\ncontents protected, suffice for such services. Moreover, even where\r\nit would be very desirable indeed to have the hull protected by armor\r\nto a sufficient extent to preserve the ship’s buoyancy and stability\r\nfrom ready destruction by gun-fire, it is often impracticable to give\r\nthe ship that protection. This is true, for example, of all small\r\ncorvettes, sloops, and gun-vessels, which are too small to float\r\nthe necessary armor-plates, in addition to all the indispensable\r\nweights of hull, steam-machinery, fuel, armament, ammunition, crew,\r\nand stores. It would be both idle and unreasonable, therefore, to\r\ncomplain of the construction of some ships with the protecting armor\r\nlimited, or even, in certain cases, with no protecting armor at all.\r\nSuch ships must be built, and in considerable number, for the British\r\nnavy. But this necessity should neither blind us to the exposure and\r\ndestructibility of all such vessels, nor induce us to endeavor to\r\nkeep that exposure and destructibility out of our own sight. Still\r\nless should it encourage us to sanction, even for a moment, such an\r\nabuse of terms as to hold up as “armored” and “protected” ships those\r\nwhich, whether unavoidably or avoidably, have been deprived of the\r\nnecessary amount of armor to keep them afloat under the fire of small\r\nor even of moderately powerful guns.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to review the British navy, and to see\r\nof what ships it really consists. In this review it will not be\r\nnecessary to pass before the eyes of the reader that large number\r\nof vessels of which even the boilers and magazines are without any\r\narmor or thick-plate protection whatever. It will help, nevertheless,\r\nto make the nature and extent of the navy understood if these are\r\ngrouped and summarized in a few sentences. Neglecting altogether\r\nall large vessels with timber frames (which may be regarded as out\r\nof date, seeing that all the war vessels of considerable size now\r\nbuilt for the navy have iron or steel frames), it may be first said\r\nthat there are but three ships of the large or frigate class in the\r\nBritish navy which carry no thick protecting plate at all, _viz._,\r\nthe _Inconstant_, the _Shah_, and the _Raleigh_. Of much less size\r\nthan these, and equally devoid of protection, are the two very fast\r\nvessels, the _Iris_ and _Mercury_, built as special despatch-vessels,\r\nsteaming at their best at about eighteen knots. Among the unarmored\r\ncorvettes are the _Active_, _Bacchante_, _Boadicea_, _Euryalus_,\r\n_Rover_, and _Volage_, all exceeding fourteen knots in speed,\r\nand all more than three thousand tons displacement. Then follow\r\nthirty-six smaller and less swift corvettes, nearly one-half the\r\nnumber being built wholly of wood, most of which exceed, however,\r\nthirteen knots in speed; and below these about an equal number\r\nof sloops of less speed and tonnage. The smaller gun-vessels and\r\ngun-boats need not be summarized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “INCONSTANT.”]\r\n\r\nPassing on to vessels which, although themselves unarmored, have\r\nthick-plate decks to give some protection to the machinery, we\r\nobserve first that there are eight ships of three thousand five\r\nhundred to three thousand seven hundred tons built and under\r\nconstruction, _viz._, the _Amphion_, _Arethusa_, _Leander_,\r\n_Phaeton_, _Mersey_, _Severn_, _Forth_, and _Thames_.[7] Lord Brassey\r\nvery properly classes such of these vessels as he mentions in his\r\nlists as “unarmored ships,” although, as before mentioned, when two\r\nof them—the _Mersey_ and _Severn_—were designed, with a deck two\r\ninches thick, the Admiralty at first ventured to put them forward as\r\n“armored ships.”\r\n\r\nAscending in the scale of protection, and dealing for the present\r\nwith sea-going vessels only, we come to a long series of ships\r\nwhich are undeserving of the designation of armored ships, because\r\nthey are liable to destruction by guns without the limited amount\r\nof armor which they carry being attacked at all. These ships are\r\nthe _Impérieuse_ and _Warspite_, previously discussed, and also the\r\n_Ajax_, _Agamemnon_, _Colossus_, _Edinburgh_, and the six large\r\nships of the “Admiral” class. Any one who has intelligently perused\r\nthe report of the committee on the _Inflexible_ would justify the\r\ninclusion of that ship in this category; but she is omitted here out\r\nof deference to the strenuous exertions which were made to invent or\r\ndevise some little stability for her, even when her bow and stern\r\nare supposed to be badly injured, and out of compassion upon those\r\nofficers of the Admiralty who have long ago repented those trying\r\ncompromises with conscience by aid of which they expressed some\r\nslight confidence in her ability to float upright with her unarmored\r\nends badly damaged. She is omitted also out of gratitude to Lord\r\nBrassey for a sentence in which, while saving her from being placed\r\nin so dreadful a category, he honestly places some of the other ships\r\nin it without qualification or circumlocution. He says: “In one\r\nimportant particular the _Ajax_ and _Agamemnon_ are inferior to the\r\n_Inflexible_. The central armored citadel is not, as it is in the\r\ncase of the _Inflexible_, of sufficient displacement to secure the\r\nstability of the ship should the unarmored ends be destroyed.”[8] In\r\nanother place the former Secretary to the Admiralty, referring to\r\nthe report of the _Inflexible_ committee (which was nominated by the\r\nAdmiralty, and under heavy obligations to support it), says: “It is\r\ndoubtless very desirable that our armored ships should possess a more\r\nample margin of stability than is provided in the armored citadel of\r\nthe _Inflexible_. The ideas of the committee and of Sir Edward Reed\r\non this point were in entire accord.”[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “COLOSSUS.”]\r\n\r\nIt has recently been acknowledged that, as Lord Brassey states, the\r\n_Ajax_ and _Agamemnon_ are so constructed that they are dependent\r\nfor their ability to float, the right side uppermost, upon their\r\nunarmored ends. To call such ships “armored ships” is, as we have\r\nseen, to mislead the public. But some pains have been taken of late\r\nto show that the “Admiral” class is better off in this respect,\r\nand certainly the known opinions of the present writer have been so\r\nfar respected in these ships that their armored citadels, so called,\r\nhave been made somewhat longer and of greater proportionate area. The\r\nfollowing figures have been given:\r\n\r\n                      Percentage of water-line area\r\n                          covered by armor.\r\n  Inflexible                     42.\r\n  Agamemnon                      45.4\r\n  Collingwood                    54.15\r\n  Camperdown                     56.35\r\n\r\nBut any one who understands this question knows perfectly well\r\nthat “percentage of water-line area covered by armor” in no way\r\nrepresents the relative stabilities of these ships. Indeed, that is\r\nobvious upon the face of the matter, because we have seen the _Ajax_\r\nand _Agamemnon_ pronounced devoid of the necessary stability when\r\ninjured, while the _Inflexible_ is said to possess it, although the\r\nformer vessel has 45½ per cent. of the water-line area covered, while\r\nthe latter has but 42 per cent. But this is not the consideration\r\nwhich has led to the condemnation of the whole “Admiral” class of\r\nso-called iron-clads as not possessing the essential characteristic\r\nof an armored ship, _viz._, the power to float, and to float with\r\nneedful buoyancy and stability, all the time the armor is unpierced.\r\nThe ground of that condemnation is to be found in the introduction\r\ninto the “Admirals” of a dangerous combination from which the\r\n_Inflexible_ and _Agamemnon_ and other like ships are exempt—the\r\ncombination of long unarmored ends comprising about forty-five per\r\ncent. of the water-line area with so shallow a belt of armor that,\r\nwhen the unarmored ends are injured and filled by the sea (as they\r\nwould be in action), there would remain so little armor left above\r\nwater that a very slight inclination of the ship would put it all\r\nbelow water. In the _Agamemnon_ class, small as the initial stability\r\nmay be (and with the unarmored ends torn open it would be nothing),\r\nthe armor is carried up to a reasonable height above water. But\r\nin the “Admiral” class all the advantage arising from a slightly\r\nlengthened citadel is more than destroyed by this lowering of the\r\narmor. So great is the consequent danger of these ships capsizing,\r\nif ever called upon to engage in a serious battle at close quarters,\r\nthat the writer cannot conscientiously regard them as “armored\r\nships,” but must in common fairness to the officers and men who are\r\nto serve in them, and to the nation which might otherwise put its\r\ntrust in them, relegate them to the category of ships with only parts\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that nothing has yet been said about thickness\r\nof armor, although that is, of course, a very important element\r\nof a ship’s safety or danger. But important as it is, it has to be\r\nkept scrupulously separated from the question just discussed—the\r\nlimitation of the armor’s extent—because no misrepresentation and\r\nno misconception can well arise concerning the relative power or\r\ntrustworthiness of ships armored variously as to thickness, while\r\nmuch misrepresentation has actually taken place, and much consequent\r\nmisconception has actually arisen, on the other matter, more than one\r\nEuropean government having deliberately placed in the category of\r\n“armored ships” ships which in no true sense of the word can be so\r\nclassed.\r\n\r\nThe following classifications will conform to the foregoing views,\r\ndescribing as “armored ships” only those which have sufficient\r\nside-armor to protect them from being sunk or capsized by the fire of\r\nguns all the time the armor remains unpierced:\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH SHIPS OF WAR, BUILT AND BUILDING.\r\n\r\nARMORED SHIPS WITH THICK ARMOR.\r\n\r\n

upward are called ships with\r\nthick armor; those with armor less than twelve inches but more than\r\neight inches thick are designated as ships with medium armor; and\r\nthose with 8-inch armor or less as ships with thin armor.\r\n\r\nA number of vessels of the “Scout” class are now under construction\r\nfor the Admiralty. There is a disposition in certain quarters to\r\ninclude these among the ships of the class recorded in the last\r\ntable. A transverse section of one of these is given here, in which\r\nthe so-called protective deck is but three-eighths of an inch in\r\nthickness, and can therefore be pierced by any gun afloat, from the\r\nlargest down to the very smallest. It would be quite absurd to speak\r\nof this class of vessels as being in any way “protected” against gun\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe first-class ships, so called, and the armored cruisers referred\r\nto in the former part of this chapter as having been promised to\r\nParliament by the Admiralty representatives, were ordered, and work\r\nupon them is well under way in the yards of those firms to whom\r\ntheir building has been intrusted. The former are two in number, and\r\ntheir principal dimensions and particulars are as follows: length,\r\n340 feet; breadth, 70 feet; draught of water, 26 feet; displacement,\r\n10,400 tons; indicated horse-power, 10,000; estimated speed, 16\r\nknots; thickness of armor, 18 inches; largest guns, 110 tons. The\r\narmor-belt in these ships is a little more than 160 feet long, or\r\nabout half their length, but rises to a height of only two feet six\r\ninches above the water. Before and abaft the belt under-water armored\r\ndecks extend to the stem and stern respectively, as in the “Admiral”\r\nclass. Besides the two 110-ton guns, which, as has been said, are\r\nplaced in a turret forward and fire over the upper deck, there are\r\ntwelve 6-inch guns ranged round the after-part of the ship on the\r\nupper deck. A certain amount of protection has been given to these\r\nguns by means of armor-plating, but as this is only three inches\r\nthick, it can be said to do little more than protect the gun crews\r\nfrom the fire of rifles and of the smallest machine-guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSVERSE SECTION OF ONE OF THE NEW “SCOUTS”]\r\n\r\nOf the armored cruisers,[16] five have been contracted for. Their\r\nprincipal dimensions and particulars are: length, 300 feet; breadth,\r\n56 feet; draught of water, 21 feet; displacement, 5000 tons;\r\nindicated horse-power, 8500; estimated speed, 18 knots; thickness of\r\narmor, 10 inches; largest guns, 18 tons. These vessels are protected\r\nby an armor-belt nearly two hundred feet long, which extends to a\r\nheight of one foot six inches above the water, and to a depth of four\r\nfeet below it, and they also have under-water decks before and abaft\r\nthe belt. They carry two 18-ton guns, one well forward, ranging right\r\nround the bow, and the other well aft, ranging right round the stern,\r\nas well as five 6-inch guns on each broadside, the foremost and\r\naftermost of which are placed on projecting sponsons, by which they\r\nare enabled to fire right ahead and right astern respectively. None\r\nof these guns is protected except by the thin shields usually fitted\r\nto keep off rifle fire from those actually working the guns.\r\n\r\nNo mention has yet been made of the troop or transport ships of\r\nthe British navy. There are in all about a dozen of these, but by\r\nfar the most conspicuous and important of them are the five Indian\r\ntransports which were built about twenty years ago, conjointly by the\r\nAdmiralty and the government of India, and ever since worked by those\r\ndepartments of the State with general satisfaction. One of these, the\r\n_Jumna_, is illustrated in the annexed figure. So satisfied was the\r\nlate Director of Transports, Sir William R. Mends, K.C.B., with the\r\nservices of these ships that, before retiring from his office, he\r\ninformed the writer that if he had to assist in the construction of a\r\nnew fleet of such transports he would desire but a single improvement\r\nin them, as working ships, and that was the raising of the lower deck\r\none foot, in order to increase to that extent the stowage of the\r\nholds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “JUMNA.”]\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this chapter the writer made reference to the\r\ninfluence exerted upon European ship-building by the incidents of the\r\nAmerican civil war. He will conclude by a reference to an influence\r\nexerted upon his own mind and judgment by the most distinguished\r\nnaval hero of that war, the late Admiral Farragut. On the occasion\r\nof that gallant officer’s visit to England the Board of Admiralty\r\ninvited him, as a wholly exceptional compliment, to accompany it on\r\nits annual official visit of inspection to her Majesty’s dockyards.\r\nOn the way from Chatham to Sheerness in the Admiralty yacht, the\r\nwriter had a most instructive conversation with the admiral as to the\r\nresults of his practical experience of naval warfare at the brilliant\r\ncapture of New Orleans, and elsewhere, and one of those results was\r\nthis: “Never allow your men to be deceived as to the ships in which\r\nyou expect them to fight. They will fight in anything, and fight to\r\nthe death, if they know beforehand what they are going about, and\r\nwhat is expected of them. But if you deceive them, and expose them to\r\ndangers of which they know nothing, and they find this out in battle,\r\nthey are very apt to become bewildered, to lose heart all at once,\r\nand to fail you just when you most require their utmost exertions.”\r\nThe writer has not forgotten this, and will not forget it. The\r\nBritish Admiralty is, unhappily, altogether unmindful of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no rigorous law by which a universal naval policy may be\r\nformulated, for a nation’s environment, geographical and political,\r\ndefines the conditions that must be obeyed. Underneath all, however,\r\nthe immutable principle exists that the first and supreme duty of a\r\nnavy is to protect its own coasts. The measures required to achieve\r\nthis end are as various as a country’s necessities, resources,\r\nopportunities, and temperament. England, for example, has always\r\nguarded her homes, not at the hearth-stone nor the threshold, but\r\nwithin gunshot of her enemy’s territory; her defence has been an\r\nattack upon his inner line, and her vessels have been, not corsairs\r\npreying upon merchantmen, but battle-ships, ready for duel or for\r\nfleet engagement, whether they had the odds against them or not. This\r\nis the true sailor instinct; this has made England’s greatness.\r\n\r\nTo-day the question is so much governed by the complexities of modern\r\nprogress that the details must be altered to suit the new demands;\r\nfor it is not the England of the British Islands nor of the sparsely\r\nsettled colonies that is now to be defended—it is a Greater Britain.\r\nThe trade and commerce of England have increased so enormously in\r\nlate years that no figures are necessary to show the interests she\r\nhas afloat; but as proof of her growth in territory and in population\r\noutside of the mother-country, these statistics, taken from a late\r\nnumber of the _Nineteenth Century_, may perhaps be quoted:\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTY YEARS’ GROWTH OF INDIA AND THE COLONIES.\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\n                                      1835.          1885.\r\n  Area governed in square miles      600,000      1,380,000\r\n  Population of European stock       300,000        500,000\r\n  Population, colored             96,000,000    254,000,000\r\n  State revenues                 £19,000,000    £74,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIES AND DEPENDENCIES.\r\n\r\n                                      1835.          1885.\r\n  Area governed in square miles      520,000      7,000,000\r\n  Population of European stock     1,800,000      9,500,000\r\n  Population, colored              2,100,000      8,000,000\r\n  State revenues                  £5,000,000    £51,000,000\r\n\r\nThat is to say, in fifty years England has added 7,260,000 square\r\nmiles to her territory, and nearly trebled the population she\r\ncontrols in India and her colonies. Is it necessary to add that with\r\nall this at stake the ocean highways which her ships traverse must be\r\nheld toll free; that the nations which she has peopled and owns must\r\nbe protected; that the enemy’s squadrons which will seek to cut off\r\nher food supply, destroy her commerce, and burn her coaling stations,\r\nmust be chased and captured; or that in the line of battle her ships\r\nmust meet his and conquer? Sea-going and sea-keeping fleets and their\r\nauxiliaries must always be ready; transferable forts for protection\r\nabroad, and coast-defence ships for safety at home, must be kept\r\nafloat; and, in a word, every means must be employed which, through\r\nsuccessful sea-war, will maintain her integrity as a nation. Her navy\r\nmust be eclectic in types, the exact instrument for any expected\r\noperation being always at hand; her maritime administration must be\r\ncomprehensive; and her preparation ever such as will anticipate and\r\nsurpass that of all her rivals. Enormously armored battle-ships may\r\nbe economically wrong, but while other countries build them so must\r\nshe; for her immunity depends not upon treaties nor the friendly but\r\nfalse protestations of rivals, but upon the fear of her unassailable\r\nsuperiority. A mistaken naval policy is to any nation a grave\r\ndisaster, but to England it means ruin. “We cannot allow,” wrote\r\nLord Brassey, “any foreign power to possess vessels which we cannot\r\noverhaul, or to carry guns at sea which may inflict a damaging blow\r\nto which it is impossible for us to reply. We must have ships as fast\r\nas the fastest, and guns at least equal to the most powerful which\r\nare to be found in the hands of any possible enemy.”\r\n\r\nKnowing, then, the interests imperilled, English designers are keen\r\nto achieve the best results; and when, as they believe, this has\r\nbeen accomplished, is it a wonder that they fall tooth and nail in\r\na white-heat of positive assertion and flat contradiction upon all\r\nwho differ from them? All are striving so honestly for the common\r\ngood of the great country which they love with such intense and\r\ninsular patriotism that even their imbittered differences of belief\r\ncommand the respect of right-thinking men everywhere. But in these\r\nvariant faiths where is the truth? The question has run the gamut\r\nof experiment without being solved, the pendulum has swung from side\r\nto side and found no point of rest, and to-day there is a fixed\r\nagreement only as to the dangers which threaten.\r\n\r\nThe most marked tendencies, however, in all modern design are the\r\ndiminution of side armor, the increase of deck protection, and the\r\ndevelopment of speed. The public mind is so familiar with the great\r\nspeed of the large mail-boats that a common question, often put as an\r\ninquiry of disparaging comparison, is why war-vessels do not steam\r\nas fast. The simplest answer to this is that they do, and in types\r\nwhich, like the big steamers, are special, the boasted achievements\r\nhave been surpassed. Of course the number of vessels that can make\r\nnineteen knots is limited, because the man-of-war is hampered by\r\nnecessities of space, weight, and safety, which do not obtain with\r\nthe others. Mr. White, who has been so often, and, it is to be hoped,\r\nso advantageously, quoted in this editing, says: “The necessity for\r\ngiving protection to the engines and boilers of war-ships introduces\r\nspecial restrictions and difficulties in the design which are not\r\nknown in merchant-ships, wherever in war-ships the overshadowing\r\nnecessities of fighting power compel the acceptance in many cases\r\nof limited space and other inconveniences.... Merchant-steamers\r\nof all classes are built and engined for the purpose of steaming\r\ncontinuously at certain maximum speeds, and making fairly uniform\r\npassages; they consequently possess a considerable reserve of boiler\r\npower to meet adverse conditions of wind and sea. War-ships, on\r\nthe contrary, ordinarily cruise at very low speeds, and yet must\r\nbe capable of reaching very high speeds when required in action or\r\nchasing. A war-ship, for instance, that attained about sixteen knots\r\non the measured mile, and could steam continuously at sea, as long as\r\nher coal lasted, at a speed of about fifteen knots, would ordinarily\r\nhave to cruise at from nine to ten knots. At this low speed she\r\nwould require, say, only _one-seventh_ of the indicated horse-power\r\nwhich would be developed at her full sea speed, or say _one-tenth_\r\nof what would be developed on the measured mile. This obviously\r\nintroduces conditions of a character entirely different from those of\r\nthe merchant-ship. The war-ship’s machinery must be so designed that\r\nthe power necessary to give her high speed at long intervals and for\r\nshort periods should be secured with the least expenditure of weight\r\nconsistent with insuring the maximum performance when required, and\r\nwith the provision of proper strength and durability.”\r\n\r\nThe very vague ideas existing as to the cost of increased speed\r\nmay be illustrated by a statement of the penalty this imposes in a\r\n10,000 ton armored vessel. If at 10 knots this ship develops 1700\r\nhorse-power, there will be required at 15 knots, not one-third\r\nmore, but 6200 horse-power—that is, over three times as much—and\r\nfor 17 knots 12,000 horse-power, or an increase of 10,300 must\r\nbe developed. This also demonstrates how much the ratio between\r\nspeed and power falls; because if at 2000 horse-power 2.3 knots\r\nare gained for an increase of 1000 horse-power, at 12,000 for a\r\nsimilar increment of 1000 only one-quarter of a knot is obtained. In\r\n1830 the steam pressure carried was from two to three pounds, and\r\nthe coal expenditure each hour for every horse-power reached nine\r\npounds; in 1886 the pressure had increased to 150 pounds, and the\r\nfuel consumption had fallen to 1.5 pounds, and to-day pressures of\r\n200 pounds are to be utilized. As the swifter vessel with the higher\r\neconomy is enabled to choose its range and position, and keep the sea\r\nfor longer periods, it is easily seen that this question of speed is\r\nuniversally accepted as vital.\r\n\r\nA parliamentary statement made in February shows that the following\r\nadditions to the English fleet will be passed this year into the\r\nfirst-class reserve, and held ready for sea service at forty-eight\r\nhours’ notice.\r\n\r\n  Thick armor battle-ship (_Hero_)                                 1\r\n  Partially armored ships of the _Admiral_ class\r\n      (_Rodney_, _Howe_, and _Benbow_)                             3\r\n  Partially armored cruisers (_Warspite_, _Orlando_,\r\n      _Narcissus_, _Australia_, _Galatea_, and _Undaunted_)        6\r\n  Partially protected cruisers (_Severn_ and _Thames_)             2\r\n  Torpedo cruisers—six of the _Archer_ class, one of the\r\n      _Scout_ class (_Fearless_)                                   7\r\n  Torpedo gun-boats of the _Rattlesnake_ class                     3\r\n  Composite gun-boats and sloops of the _Buzzard_ and\r\n      _Rattler_ class                                              3\r\n                                                                  --\r\n                              Total                               25\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1887-88 one armored ship, the _Camperdown_, and one\r\nprotected cruiser, the _Forth_, will be nearly finished, the _Anson_\r\nwill be approaching completion, and the new belted cruisers of the\r\n_Orlando_ class will be far advanced. The armored battle-ships\r\n_Victoria_ and _Sanspareil_, of 10,470 tons displacement, are to be\r\ndelivered according to contract in October, 1888, and the _Trafalgar_\r\nand _Nile_, the largest war-vessels yet laid down in England,\r\nare being pushed rapidly. Out of the thirty-seven ships building\r\nor incomplete at the commencement of 1887-88, twenty-six will be\r\ncompleted by the end of the year, thus leaving only nine of those\r\nspecified, and two others not ordered, in the programme of 1885 to be\r\nfinished subsequently. The ships projected for this year include:\r\n\r\n  20-knot steel-bottomed partially protected cruisers\r\n      (_Medea_, _Medusa_)                                          2\r\n  19¾-knot copper-bottomed partially protected cruisers\r\n      (_Melpomene_, _Marathon_, _Magicienne_)                      3\r\n  Composite sloops of the _Buzzard_ class (_Nymphe_, _Daphné_)     2\r\n  Composite gun-boats, improved _Rattlers_, (_Pigmy_,\r\n      _Pheasant_, _Partridge_, _Plover_, _Pigeon_, _Peacock_)      6\r\n  Torpedo gun-boat of the _Grasshopper_ class (_Sharpshooter_)     1\r\n                                                                  --\r\n                          Total                                   14\r\n\r\nBesides the ships that have been or will be finished in 1886-87,\r\nit is believed that thirty-five of the fifty-five first-class\r\ntorpedo-boats (125 to 150 feet in length) will be added to the twenty\r\nwhich were completed in June.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the vessels mentioned above there are others not\r\ndescribed nor noticed in the text. The two battle-ships referred to\r\nupon page 55 are the _Sanspareil_ and the _Victoria_, the latter\r\nformerly known as the _Renown_, but named anew in April last. These\r\nships are to carry 1180 tons of coal, and under forced draught\r\nare expected to develop 12,000 horse-power and a speed of 16.75\r\nknots. The 9.2-inch 18-ton stern pivot gun originally intended for\r\nthese vessels has been replaced by a 10-inch 26-ton rifle, and the\r\nsecondary battery now includes twenty-one 6 and 3-pounder rapid\r\nfire guns. The other prominent departures from the central-citadel\r\ntype are the _Nile_ and _Trafalgar_. These 11,940-ton ships are the\r\nlargest war machines ever laid down for the British service. They\r\nare to carry revolving turrets on the fore and aft line amidships,\r\nand will have an intermediate broadside battery mounted in a\r\nsuperstructure which covers the full width of the ship between the\r\nturrets. A water-belt line 230 feet in length rises in the waist\r\nfor a distance of 193 feet, and both belt and citadel are covered\r\nby a three-inch steel deck, which is curved forward and aft to\r\nstrengthen the ram and protect the steering gear. The armor is\r\ncompound—eighteen inches thick on the turret and twenty inches\r\nthick as a maximum on the water-line—and to support the backing\r\nthere is an inner skin two inches thick. The armament consists of\r\nfour 13½-inch 68-ton breech-loading rifles, two in each turret;\r\nof eight 5-inch guns in broadside on a covered deck protected by\r\nthree inches of vertical armor, and of eight 6-pounder rapid fire,\r\nten 3-pounder Maxim, and four Gardner guns. The horse-power under\r\nforced draft is to be 12,000, and the estimated speed is 16½ knots.\r\nThe main battery originally designed for these ships included only\r\none 68-ton breech-loading rifle for each turret; subsequently this\r\nplan was rejected, and the armament stated above was adopted. “The\r\neconomy of mounting the heavy guns in pairs arises not only from\r\nthe increased power thus obtained from a given weight of guns, but\r\nfrom the fact that it requires but little more armor to protect two\r\nguns than to protect one. It also requires more machinery to work\r\ntwo guns separately than in pairs, and the magazine and ammunition\r\nsupply arrangements of guns mounted separately are necessarily more\r\ncomplicated, and require more men to operate them than those mounted\r\nin pairs.\r\n\r\n“The French idea in mounting their heavy guns singly in three or four\r\narmored barbettes is evidently so to distribute the gun-power as to\r\nleave a reserve of heavy guns in event of damage to one or more.\r\nBut the demands for economy in weight are so great that two armored\r\nstructures widely separated would seem to furnish as satisfactory a\r\nscattering of the heavy gun-power as is justifiable. Guns mounted\r\non the middle line suffer less disturbance in rolling than those\r\nmounted either in the waist or _en échelon_, and their fire should be\r\ncorrespondingly more accurate.”[18]\r\n\r\nThe _Impérieuse_ and _Warspite_ have powerful ram bows, a steel\r\nprotective deck, and a belt of compound armor which is 139 feet in\r\nlength on the water-line, 8 feet in width, and 10 inches thick. The\r\nengines were designed to develop 7500 horse-power and a speed of\r\n16 knots, but on her trial the _Impérieuse_ attained with forced\r\ndraft a maximum speed of 18.2 knots and 10,344 horse-power, and a\r\nmean speed, after four runs on the measured mile, of 17.21 knots.\r\nIn September, 1886, with all guns and stores in place, and with 900\r\ntons of coal in the bunkers, the _Impérieuse_ developed a mean speed\r\nof 16 knots. The armament is composed of four 9.2-inch guns, mounted\r\nin four 8-inch plated circular barbettes, and situated one forward,\r\none aft, and two in the waist; on the gun-deck there are six 6-inch\r\nguns, and the secondary battery is made up of twelve 6-pounder rapid\r\nfire, ten 1-inch Nordenfeldt, and four Gardner guns, and of four\r\nabove-water and two submerged torpedo-tubes. Owing to the increased\r\nweights of the armament, stores, machinery, and equipments put in\r\nthese vessels since they were first designed, the draught of water is\r\nnow found to be nearly three feet greater than was intended. It is\r\nonly fair to state that they were originally expected to carry but\r\n400 tons of coal, though curiously enough, when this fuel capacity\r\nwas subsequently increased to 1200 tons, no allowance was made for\r\nthe additional armored surface required.\r\n\r\nThe armored free-board was to have been 3 feet 3 inches at a draught\r\nof 25 feet, but the supplementary weights increased the draught 11½\r\ninches and reduced this free-board to 2 feet 3½ inches; and later,\r\nwhen the full bunker capacity of 900 tons was utilized, the draught\r\nwas again increased 14 inches, and the free-board lowered to 1 foot\r\n1½ inches. Finally it was for a time determined to carry 1200 tons of\r\ncoal, though this would result, when the ship was fully equipped for\r\nsea, in bringing the top of the armored belt nearly flush with the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“As four of the torpedo tubes are above water, and have ports\r\ncut through the armor-belt, this decrease of free-board rendered\r\nthem useless, it having been shown during an experimental cruise\r\non the _Impérieuse_ in December, 1886, with but 800 tons of coal\r\non board and in a calm sea, that in attempting to discharge the\r\nbroadside torpedoes they jammed in the tubes, and altered shape\r\nto a dangerous degree. In order to make them of any use they will\r\nhave to be restored to their intended height above the water-line.\r\nIt is believed this can be accomplished by removing part of the\r\nsuperstructure, by dispensing with all top-hamper and its attendant\r\nsupply of stores, equipments, etc., and by limiting the maximum coal\r\nsupply to the bunker capacity of 900 tons. The masts are accordingly\r\nbeing removed from both vessels, leaving them but one signal mast\r\nstepped between the funnels, and fitted with a military top.”[19]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1886, the _Warspite_, when very light, developed with natural\r\ndraft 7451 horse-power and a speed of 15½ knots on a consumption\r\nof 2.69 pounds of coal each hour per horse-power; and with forced\r\ndraft 10,242 horse-power and a speed of 17¼ knots were obtained on a\r\nsimilar consumption of 2.9 pounds of coal.\r\n\r\nIn the minority report of the 1871 Committee on Designs Admiral\r\nElliot and Rear-Admiral Ryder “strongly advocated the use of a\r\nprotective deck in conjunction with other features, instead of\r\nside-armor, for protection to stability. The idea as regards cruisers\r\nwas first carried out in the full-rigged ships of the English _Comus_\r\nclass of 2380 tons displacement and 13 knots speed, launched in\r\n1878, in which the engines, boilers, and magazines were covered by a\r\nhorizontal 1½-inch steel deck placed below the water-line, the space\r\nimmediately above containing cellular subdivisions.\r\n\r\n“Then followed, in 1882, the _Leander_ and her three sister\r\nbark-rigged vessels, which are a compromise between the speed of\r\nthe _Iris_ and the protection of the _Comus_. They are of 3750 tons\r\ndisplacement and 17 knots maximum speed; they carry ten 6-inch 4-ton\r\nB. L. R., and 725 tons of coal, and have a ‘partial protective deck,’\r\ncovering engines, boilers, and magazines, which is 1½ inches thick,\r\nand which bends down below the load water-line at the sides. Our\r\nnew cruisers, the _Chicago_, _Boston_, and _Atlanta_, bear a closer\r\nresemblance to this type than they do to any other in respect of\r\ntheir protection. About this time the Chilian cruiser _Esmeralda_, of\r\n3000 tons, appeared, having a protective deck complete from stem to\r\nstern-post, carrying an exceptionally heavy battery and coal supply,\r\nand withal attaining the unprecedented speed of 18.28 knots. Italy\r\nwas not slow to perceive the advantages of this type, and accordingly\r\nbought an improved _Esmeralda_, the _Giovanni Bausan_, and at once\r\ncommenced to build four others, the _Vesuvio_, _Stromboli_, _Etna_,\r\nand _Fieramosca_, each of 3530 tons. Japan ordered two improved\r\n_Esmeraldas_, the sister ships _Naniwa-Kan_ and _Tacachiho-Kan_, from\r\nArmstrong, in England, and a similar vessel, the _Unebi_, in France,\r\nwhile England laid down a similar class, the _Mersey_ and three\r\nothers, and France a similar cruiser, the _Sfax_, of 4400 tons.”[20]\r\nThe _Unebi_ was a bark-rigged, twin-screw, protected steel cruiser of\r\n3651 tons. Her armament consisted of four 9.45-inch breech-loaders\r\non sponsons, six 5.9-inch breech-loaders in broadside, one 5.9-inch\r\nbow pivot, twelve rapid fire and two Nordenfeldt machine guns, and\r\na supply of Whitehead torpedoes. In September, 1886, she developed\r\nwith forced draft 7000 horse-power and an average speed of 18.5 knots\r\nduring four runs over the measured mile. She sailed for Japan in\r\nNovember, 1886, with a French crew numbering seventy-eight men, left\r\nSingapore for Yokohama on December 3, 1886, and has never been seen\r\nnor heard of since. She is said to have been top-heavy, and to have\r\nrolled dangerously in a sea way.\r\n\r\nThe _Naniwa-Kan_, a steel cruiser, 300 feet in length and 46 feet in\r\nbeam, has on an extreme draught of 19 feet 6 inches a displacement\r\nof 3730 tons; the steel hull is fitted with a double bottom under\r\nthe engines and boilers, and has a strong protective deck, two to\r\nthree inches thick, which extends from the ram to the stern-post,\r\nand carries its edges four feet below, and its crown one inch above,\r\nthe load water-line. There are ten complete transverse and several\r\npartial water-tight bulkheads; the space between the protective\r\nand the main deck is minutely subdivided into compartments, which\r\nare utilized as coal-bunkers, store-rooms, chain-lockers, and\r\ntorpedo-rooms; the conning-tower is protected by two inches of steel\r\narmor; and two ammunition hoists, three inches thick, lead from the\r\nshell-rooms to the loading towers at the breech of the two heavy\r\nguns. The armament consists of two 10-inch 28-ton breech-loading\r\nrifles on central pivots, with 2-inch steel screens, and of six\r\n6-inch guns, with a secondary battery of two 6-pounder rapid fire,\r\neight 1-inch Nordenfeldt, four Gardner guns, and four above-water\r\ntorpedo tubes. The engines are of the horizontal compound type,\r\nsituated in two compartments, one abaft the other, and there are\r\nsix single-ended locomotive three-furnace boilers in two separate\r\ncompartments, with athwartship fire-rooms; the indicated horse-power\r\nunder a forced draft was 7650, and the maximum speed 18.9 knots. This\r\nhas since been exceeded. The _Mersey_ and her class—the _Severn_,\r\n_Thames_, and _Forth_—like the _Naniwa_ are unarmored steel\r\ncruisers, with a complete protective deck, the horizontal portion\r\nof which is one foot above, and the inclined three inches below,\r\nthe water-line. The main battery of these ships consists of two\r\n8-inch guns, mounted on central pivots forward and abaft a covered\r\ndeck which carries ten 6-inch guns; the secondary battery has ten\r\n1-inch Nordenfeldt and two Gardner machine guns, and there are six\r\nabove-water torpedo-tubes in broadside.\r\n\r\n“The development of the _Mersey_ design has resulted in the new\r\nEnglish ‘belted cruisers,’ in which, to satisfy the demand for a\r\nwater-line belt of armor, the displacement has been increased to 5000\r\ntons.”\r\n\r\nThe five originally projected—the _Orlando_, _Narcissus_,\r\n_Australia_, _Galatea_, and _Undaunted_—together with the\r\n_Immortalité_, subsequently laid down, have already been launched,\r\nand an additional cruiser of the same type, the _Aurora_, is well\r\nadvanced. The general construction is similar to the _Naniwa_\r\nand _Mersey_, the larger tonnage being given in order to carry a\r\nwater-line belt, which is ten inches thick, stretches for 190 feet\r\namidships, and was intended to extend from 1½ feet above to four\r\nfeet below the load water-line. The armored deck is from two to\r\nthree inches thick, and the conning-tower is thirteen inches. The\r\ntriple-expansion engines are planned to develop 8500 horse-power\r\nand a speed of 18 knots. Like the _Impérieuse_ and _Warspite_,\r\nthese vessels are found to draw much more water than was originally\r\nproposed. When designed in 1884 they were expected to have, with all\r\nweights on board, a mean draught of twenty-one feet, and to carry\r\nabove water eighteen inches of the five feet six inch armor-belt. But\r\na fever for improvement set in so valorously that the changes made\r\nin armament and machinery added one hundred and eighty-six tons to\r\nthe displacement and increased the draught seven inches—that is, an\r\namount which left the top of the protective belt only eleven inches\r\nabove the smooth water-line. This submersion did not, however, cool\r\nthe ardor of the Admiralty officials, for it has been decided that\r\nthe nine hundred tons of coal originally fixed as the fuel supply\r\nmust be carried; the immediate result of this is said to be an\r\nincrease in the draught of eighteen inches, and a disappearance of\r\nthe armor-belt to a point nearly six inches _below_ the water-line.\r\nSubsequent improvements will be awaited with great interest,\r\nespecially by those American journalists of inquiring tendencies who\r\nenvyingly detect between the promise and performance of these ships\r\nopportunities which, had they occurred at home, would have enabled\r\nthem to swamp our naval service and its administration in billows of\r\npitiless ink.\r\n\r\nThe most popular naval event of the year was the review in July\r\nof the British fleet assembled at Spithead. The one hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight war-vessels participating included three squadrons\r\nof armored vessels and cruisers, aggregating thirty-four ships,\r\nseventy-five torpedo-boats and gun-boats, divided into five\r\nflotillas, six training brigs, and thirteen troop-ships. Besides\r\nthese there were the troop-ships appointed to carry the distinguished\r\nvisitors, and the small vessels and dockyard craft allotted to the\r\ncorporation of Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nThe war-ships were drawn up in four lines, facing up channel, the\r\nstarboard column lying opposite the Isle of Wight, and the port\r\ncolumn off Portsmouth. The ships were two cables and the columns\r\nthree cables apart. The flotillas were ranged in double columns\r\nbetween the port line of the armored vessels and the main-land, and\r\nthe troop-ships were placed in single column between the starboard\r\nline and the Isle of Wight. This made four lines of vessels on one\r\nside of the channel and three on the other, extending from South\r\nSea Castle to the Rye Middle Shoals, or a distance of two miles. No\r\nsuch fleet was ever seen before in time of peace, for every class\r\nof the British navy was so well represented that the review of the\r\nCrimean fleet by the Queen and the Prince Consort, thirty-one years\r\nago, suffered by comparison. Some of the wooden ships which figured\r\nat that time were present, and the wide differences in everything\r\nbore strong testimony to the developments which have been made within\r\na generation. Nelson’s old ship, the _Victory_, was a conspicuous\r\nobject, and her timbers echoed again and again with cheers as boat\r\nafter boat passed her. More than that, the old ship mounted a gun or\r\ntwo and joined in the universal salute to the Queen. Shortly after\r\ntwo o’clock the _Euphrates_, _Crocodile_, and _Malabar_ hove to off\r\nOsborne as an escort to the royal yachts when the Queen embarked.\r\n\r\nThe Queen left Osborne House a few minutes before three o’clock, went\r\naboard the royal yacht _Victoria and Albert_, and left the buoy in\r\nthe bay promptly at the hour fixed. She was preceded by the _Trinity_\r\nyacht and followed by the royal yachts _Osborne_ and _Alberta_,\r\nand by the war-vessels _Enchantress_, _Helicon_, _Euphrates_,\r\n_Crocodile_, and _Malabar_. The royal procession proceeded straight\r\nto its destination and passed between the lines, leaving the\r\ncoast-defence ships, gun-boats, and torpedo-boats on the port hand.\r\nAfter steaming as far as the Horse Elbow buoy the _Victoria and\r\nAlbert_ turned to starboard, passed between the two columns of large\r\nships, and then between the lines of the foreign war-vessels. As the\r\nyacht steamed slowly by the war-ships the crews cheered loudly, but\r\nit was not until the Queen had gone through the double line that the\r\nroyal salute was fired. On board such vessels as had no masts the\r\nturrets, breastworks, and decks were lined with the crews, and the\r\nspectacle was as splendid as it was potent with an earnest evidence\r\nof mighty power. Altogether the fleet extended over four miles, and\r\neven this length was added to by the great troop-ships which steamed\r\ninto line and saluted the Queen as she made her progress.\r\n\r\nThe jubilee week was not without its accidents, for the _Ajax_ and\r\n_Devastation_ collided at the rendezvous, and subsequently the\r\n_Agincourt_ and _Black Prince_ had a similar experience. These\r\nmishaps evoked much hostile criticism, and among other things gave\r\ncurrency to an extract from a speech made by Lord Randolph Churchill\r\nseveral weeks before. Speaking of the navy, he had declared that, “In\r\nthe last twelve or thirteen years eighteen ships have been either\r\ncompleted or designed by the Admiralty to fulfil certain purposes,\r\nand on the strength of the Admiralty statements Parliament has\r\nfaithfully voted the money. The total amount which either has been\r\nor will be voted for these ships is about ten millions, and it is\r\nnow discovered and officially acknowledged that in respect of the\r\npurposes for which these ships were designed, and for the purposes\r\nfor which these ten millions either have been or will be spent, the\r\nwhole of the money has been absolutely misapplied, utterly wasted and\r\nthrown away.”\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke does not agree with this pessimism of his political\r\nopponent, though he, too, has something to say of the British fleet,\r\nin relation to its influence upon the present position of European\r\npolitics, which is well worth quoting.\r\n\r\n“There is less to be said in a hostile sense with regard to the\r\npresent position of the navy,” he concedes, “than may be said, or\r\nmust be said, about the army. Clever German officers may write\r\ntheir ‘Great Naval War of 1888,’ and describe the destruction of the\r\nBritish fleet by the French torpedo-boats, but on the whole we are\r\nnot ill-satisfied with the naval progress that has been made in the\r\nlast three years. There is plenty of room for doubt as to whether\r\nwe get full value for our money; but at all events our navy is\r\nundoubtedly and by universal admission the first navy in the world,\r\nand relatively to the French we appear to show of ships built and\r\nbuilding a number proportionate to our expenditure. The discovery of\r\nthe comparative uselessness of automatic torpedoes is an advantage\r\nto this country, and no great change in the opposite direction has\r\nrecently occurred. M. Gabriel Charmes has pointed out to France the\r\nmanner to destroy our sea-borne trade, but excellent steps have\r\nbeen taken since his book appeared to meet the danger which he\r\nobligingly made clear to us. It remains a puzzle to my civilian mind\r\nhow Italy can manage to do all that in a naval sense she does for\r\nher comparatively small expenditure, and how, spending only from a\r\nfourth to a sixth what we spend upon our navy, she can nevertheless\r\nproduce so noble a muster of great ships. But our naval dangers are,\r\nno doubt, dangers chiefly caused rather by military than by naval\r\ndefects. Our navy is greatly weakened for the discharge of its proper\r\nduties by the fact that duties are thrown upon it which no navy can\r\nefficiently discharge. As Admiral Hoskins has said, it is the duty\r\nof the commander of the British fleet to drive the hostile squadrons\r\nfrom the seas, and to shut up the enemy’s ships in his different\r\nports; but, on the other hand, he has a right to expect that our own\r\nports and coaling stations shall be protected by batteries and by\r\nland forces. This is exactly what has not yet been done, although\r\nthe defence of our coaling stations by fortresses and by adequate\r\ngarrisons is essential to the sustaining of our maritime supremacy in\r\ntime of war.\r\n\r\n“It is only, however, by comparison with our army that I think our\r\nnavy in a sound position. In other words, our military situation\r\nis so alarming that it is for a time desirable to concentrate our\r\nattention upon that, rather than upon the less pressing question of\r\nthe condition of the navy. I must not be thought, however, to admit,\r\nfor one single instant, that our navy should give us no anxiety.\r\nAs long as France remains at peace, and spends upon her navy such\r\nenormous sums as she has been spending during the last few years, she\r\nwill be sufficiently near to us in naval power to make our position\r\nsomewhat doubtful; make it depend, that is, upon how the different\r\nnew inventions may turn out in time of war. Our navy is certainly\r\nnone too large (even when the coaling stations and commercial ports\r\nhave been fortified, and made for the first time a source of strength\r\nrather than of weakness to the navy) for the duties which it has to\r\nperform. It would be as idle for us, with our present naval force, to\r\nhope to thoroughly command the Mediterranean and the Red Sea against\r\nthe French without an Italian alliance, as to try to hold our own\r\nin Turkey or in Belgium with our present army. Just as the country\r\nseems now to have made up its mind to abandon not only the defence\r\nof Turkey against Russia, but also the defence of the neutrality of\r\nBelgium, so it will have to make up its mind, unless it is prepared\r\nto increase the navy, to resort only to the Cape route in time\r\nof war. Italy being neutral, and we at war with France, we could\r\nnot at present hope to defend the whole of our colonies and trade\r\nagainst attack, and London against invasion, and yet to so guard the\r\nMediterranean and the Red Sea as to make passage past Toulon and\r\nAlgiers, Corsica and Biserta, safe. Our force is probably so superior\r\nto the French as to enable us to shut up their iron-clads; but it\r\nwould probably be easier to shut in their Mediterranean iron-clads by\r\nholding the Straits of Gibraltar than to attempt to blockade them in\r\nToulon. I confess that I cannot understand those Jingoes who think\r\nthat it is enough to shriek for Egypt, without seeing that Egypt\r\ncannot be held in time of war, or the Suez route made use of with the\r\nmilitary and naval forces that we possess at present.\r\n\r\n“As against a French and Russian combination of course we are weaker\r\nstill. Englishmen are hardly aware of the strength of Russia in\r\nthe Pacific, where, if we are to attack at all, we must inevitably\r\nfight her, and where, if we are to adopt the hopeless policy of\r\nremaining only on the defensive, we shall still have to meet her\r\nfor the protection of our own possessions. Just as the reduction\r\nof the horse artillery, comparatively unimportant in itself, has\r\nshown that the idea of the protection of Belgian neutrality has been\r\ncompletely given up, so the abandonment of Port Hamilton, instead of\r\nits fortification as a protection for our navy, seems to show that\r\nwe have lost all hope of being able to hold our own against Russia\r\nin the North Pacific. On the 1st of August Russia will have upon her\r\nNorth Pacific station—cruising, that is, between Vladivostock and\r\nYokohama—three new second-class protected ships—the _Vladimir_,\r\n_Monomakh_, and the _Dmitri Donsköi_, of nearly six thousand tons\r\napiece, and the _Duke of Edinburgh_, of four thousand six hundred\r\ntons; one older protected ship, the _Vitiaz_, of three thousand tons;\r\nfour fast-sailing cruisers—the _Naïezdnik_, the _Razboïnik_, the\r\n_Opritchnik_, and the _Djighite_; and four gun-boats, of which two\r\nare brand-new this year. While talking about their European fleets,\r\nthe Russians are paying no real attention to them, and are more and\r\nmore concentrating their strength in the North Pacific.”\r\n\r\n“The British navy,” says another writer,[21] “is not in danger,\r\nand the British navy, whatever its shortcomings, is relatively far\r\nstronger than its thoughtless detractors would have us believe. Our\r\nships do steer and our ships do steam—at least as well as those\r\nof other powers; and, what is more, our ships will ‘fight’ and our\r\nships will ‘win,’ in spite of the dismal forebodings of interested\r\npanic-mongers.\r\n\r\n“With the resources at our command, our armaments afloat admit of a\r\nrapid development, in which no other country can compete with us.

REED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to pass under review that vast array of naval\r\nconstructions which the Continental navies of Europe offer to our\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all surprising that the introduction of steam-engines,\r\nof iron and steel hulls, and of armor-plating has been attended\r\nthroughout Europe by even greater diversity of thought and practice\r\nthan has characterized our naval progress—“our progress” here\r\nsignifying that of both the United States and Great Britain. And this\r\nmay, I think, truthfully be said without in any degree neglecting the\r\nstriking originality of the American Monitors, to which I endeavored\r\nto do justice.\r\n\r\nAs regards two of the three great changes just adverted to, the only\r\ndifferences of opinion that have arisen have been in the nature\r\nof competitions rather than of conflicts. No one, so far as I am\r\naware, has ever proposed to revert to sail-power or to wooden hulls\r\nin important ships-of-war. On the contrary, the powers have been in\r\ncontinual competition in the effort to reduce the weights of the\r\nhulls of war-ships (apart from armor) by the extended use, first of\r\niron, and afterwards of steel, and to apply the savings of weight\r\nthus effected to the development of engine-power, speed, and steaming\r\nendurance. On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that the\r\ndevelopment of armor has been pursued with less constancy and less\r\nearnestness, the result being that marked contrasts are exhibited by\r\nEuropean navies.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, with little or no qualification, that all other\r\nEuropean naval powers followed, in the first place, the example set\r\nby the late Emperor Napoleon III., in _La Gloire_, by covering the\r\nwhole of the exposed part of the war-ship’s hull with armor-plating.\r\nAll the early iron-clads of Russia, Italy, Austria, and Germany were\r\nprotected from stem to stern, and from a few feet below water to\r\nthe upper deck. England did the same in the cases of a few ships,\r\nalthough she began, as we saw before, with the _Warrior_ type, in\r\nwhich the armor was limited to the central part of the ship. But the\r\nsystem of completely covering the exposed ship with armor has now\r\nentirely and properly passed away from European practice, and has\r\nbeen succeeded by varied arrangements of armor.\r\n\r\nThe importance of giving effectual protection to the hull “between\r\nwind and water,” as it is called (signifying from a few feet\r\nbelow the water-line to a few feet above that line), has been\r\nsteadily recognized by Continental governments, with but the rarest\r\nexceptions. Nothing corresponding to that wholesale abandonment of\r\narmor for about a hundred feet at each end of the ship which has been\r\npractised in the British ships of the _Inflexible_ and _Admiral_\r\ntypes is displayed in the line-of-battle ships of the Continent. In\r\nFrance, indeed, two such ships were laid down under some temporary\r\ninfluence, _viz._, the _Brennus_ and the _Charles Martel_, but they\r\nappear to have soon fallen under suspicion, and there has not been,\r\nto my knowledge, any great disposition to complete them for service.\r\nA return made by the Admiralty to the order of the House of Commons\r\nhas been printed, and says of the _Brennus_ and _Charles Martel_:\r\n“Though these vessels still appear in the list of the French navy,\r\nbut little money has been voted for their construction in 1886, and\r\nall work on them is now reported to have been stopped.” I know not\r\nwhat significance is to be attached to the fact, but I observe that\r\nthese two ships were omitted altogether from the iron-clad ships\r\nof France published so recently as May, 1886, in the _Universal\r\nRegister_ of shipping, which _Lloyd’s Register_ Committee “believe\r\nwill be found the most complete list that has yet been published.”\r\nIt seems not improbable, therefore, that the dangerous system of\r\nexposing two-thirds of the ship’s length to destruction from all\r\nkinds and every system of naval guns, even the smallest, which\r\nprevailed in the British navy for more than twelve years, and which\r\nhas now happily been superseded in the powerful new ships _Nile_ and\r\n_Trafalgar_, obtained but little more than momentary approval in\r\nFrance, and is likely to have led to the condemnation of the only two\r\nships in which it was attempted—a result which is creditable alike\r\nto French science and to French sagacity.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the _Inflexible_ system (which has met in France with the\r\nfate we have just seen) obtained temporary favor, and was adopted\r\nin the _Duilio_ and the _Dandolo_, two very large ships, of 11,000\r\ntons each, of a speed exceeding fifteen knots, and each carrying\r\nfour 100-ton guns in turrets. Although these ships are 340 feet in\r\nlength, even the armored belt amidships (if “belt” in any sense so\r\nshort a strip of armor may be called[22]) is but 107 feet long,\r\nleaving therefore 233 feet of the ship at the ends wholly devoid\r\nof water-line protection. As the author of the “citadel system,” I\r\ncannot regard such an arrangement as this as a fair and reasonable\r\nembodiment of it, the discrepancy between the armored and unarmored\r\nportions being greater in these two ships than even in the _Ajax_\r\nand _Agamemnon_, which are perhaps the worst examples of the abuse\r\nof the citadel system in the British navy. It is to the credit of\r\nthe Italian government that ships of this type were not repeated in\r\ntheir navy; and it is but right to point out that there were excuses\r\n(which probably ranked in the minds of the designers as _reasons_)\r\nfor a more extreme proportionate limitation of the citadels being\r\nadopted in the _Duilio_ and _Dandolo_ than in the _Ajax_ and\r\n_Agamemnon_. Among these were the possession by the Italian ships of\r\nheavier armaments, and of far greater steam-power and speed than the\r\nBritish ships possessed—a matter to which further reference will be\r\nmade hereafter—and probably, also, the adoption of somewhat finer\r\nwater-lines as a means of attaining the superior speed.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be well to observe that the question of\r\nleaving so-called armored line-of-battle ships without armor at\r\nthe extremities is first one of principle, and afterwards one of\r\ndegree. The principle (which should be observed in the design of\r\nevery armored vessel which is intended for the line of battle, or\r\nfor those close and severe contests of ship with ship which will\r\nprobably supersede in a great degree the system of fighting in lines\r\nof battle) is this: the proportion which the armored citadel bears to\r\nthe unarmored ends must always be such as to enable the ship to keep\r\nafloat all the time the armor itself holds out against the attack of\r\nthe enemy; so that injuries to the unarmored ends, however great or\r\nmultiplied, shall not alone suffice to destroy the ship. Whatever\r\nmay occur in the future to interfere with the application of this\r\nprinciple—and I do not deny that such interferences may arise under\r\ncertain perfectly conceivable circumstances—nothing has yet happened\r\nto justify its abandonment, or to even justify the remotest chance of\r\nits being violated.\r\n\r\nIf a ship is not intended to close with an enemy, or to fight her\r\nanyhow and anywhere on the open sea—which certainly has been\r\nthe dominant idea of the British navy, in so far as its great\r\nline-of-battle ships are concerned—if, for example, a combination of\r\nimmense speed with one or two extremely powerful and well-protected\r\nguns should serve a particular object better than a slower and more\r\nfully protected ship would serve it—then even great destructibility\r\nin the ship itself may justifiably be incurred. But for general\r\nnaval service, and in every case in which a ship is intended to\r\naccept battle with a powerful antagonist and fight it out, or to\r\nforce an action when she encounters such an enemy, it cannot be wise\r\nto leave her so exposed that that enemy may almost certainly sink\r\nher or cause her to capsize by merely pouring any kind of shot or\r\nshell into her unarmored parts. But even the observance of the above\r\ngeneral principle is not alone all that is desirable in armored\r\nline-of-battle ships. It is not well to leave even so much of the\r\nends of such ships wholly exposed as may lead to the speedy loss in\r\naction of her steaming or steering powers. The armor-belt should be\r\nof sufficient length to fairly guarantee the ship against prompt\r\ndisablement in action, and to do this it must be carried very much\r\nnearer to the bow and stern than it has been in the cases of the\r\nItalian ships (_Duilio_ and _Dandolo_) now under notice.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where ships are formed with fine water-lines,\r\nand the two opposite sides are consequently very near to each other\r\nfor many feet, it is quite unnecessary to cover them with armor.\r\nThe buoyancy comprised between the two sides aft such parts is very\r\nsmall, and consequently penetration can let but little water into\r\nthe ship, and do but little harm. It is a matter for the exercise of\r\nprofessional judgment where to draw the line between the armored and\r\nthe unarmored parts. In the new British ships _Nile_ and _Trafalgar_,\r\nwhich have excited great admiration in England, there are about sixty\r\nfeet of length at each end left without armor, and as the ships have\r\nfine lines, but are nevertheless of considerable breadth at sixty\r\nfeet from the ends, it seems probable that good judgment has been\r\nshown by their designers in this matter.\r\n\r\nI have discussed this question at some length because it is one of\r\nprimary consideration in the design of important armored ships, and\r\nbecause the abandonment of a long belt of armor is also one of the\r\nfew features of construction respecting which the designers of the\r\nContinent have steadfastly refrained from following the example set\r\nby the Admiralty Office at Whitehall from the years 1870 to 1885.\r\nIt will complete the consideration of this branch of the subject to\r\nsay that there are numerous ships of the iron-clad type in foreign\r\nnavies in which the armor (justifiably, as has just been shown)\r\nstops somewhat short of the ends, but very few indeed in which the\r\nlength of the unarmored parts exceeds that of the armored. Among\r\nthe last named may be mentioned a very questionable class of vessels\r\n(_Sachsen_ type) in the German navy, and a much smaller sea-going\r\nvessel belonging to the Argentine Republic, named the _Almirante\r\nBrown_, which is a well-designed vessel in other respects, but which,\r\non account of her long defenceless bow and stern, would do better to\r\navoid than to fight an enemy.[23]\r\n\r\nHaving now dealt with the primary question of the defence of ships by\r\nmeans of armor-belts, we come to the greater or less defence bestowed\r\nupon them above water. The course taken by the French designers, when\r\nthe increased thickness of armor made it impossible to repeat the\r\ncomplete protection adopted in _La Gloire_ and her compeers, was in\r\nsome few cases that of belting the ship with armor, and giving great\r\n“tumble home” to the sides above water, excepting at the central\r\narmored battery, thus allowing that battery to project, and its guns\r\nto fire directly ahead and astern, past the inwardly inclined sides.\r\nThis system has been strikingly carried out in the two sister ships\r\n_Courbet_ and _Dévastation_, the former of which is shown, stem on,\r\nin the cut on page 75, which is engraved from a photograph taken\r\nafter her launch, and before she began to receive her armor-plating.\r\nA representation of the sister vessel, _Dévastation_ (forming one\r\nof the series of engravings given in this chapter from drawings\r\nspecially executed for the purpose by Chevalier De Martino), forms\r\nour illustration on page 73.\r\n\r\nBut generally in the French navy, and in nearly all but its earliest\r\nships, direct head and stern fire has been obtained by means of\r\nelevated and projecting towers, armor-plated to a sufficient\r\nheight to protect the gun machinery, but with the guns themselves\r\nunprotected, and firing _en barbette_. In the case of the two ships\r\n_Dévastation_ and _Courbet_ the main-deck projecting battery carries\r\nfour guns, each commanding a full quadrant of a circle. The barbette\r\nbatteries, standing up above the upper deck, carry a powerful gun on\r\neach side of the ship, with great range of fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “DEVASTATION:” FRENCH ARMORED SHIP OF THE FIRST\r\nCLASS.]\r\n\r\nHaving given these general indications of the system of attack and\r\ndefence adopted in the French navy—by far the most important of all\r\nthe Continental navies—it now becomes desirable to go more into\r\nparticulars. It is not necessary to dwell upon the early iron-clads\r\nof France. The _Gloire_ and a dozen others of like character were all\r\nbuilt of wood, without water-tight bulkheads, without rams or spurs,\r\nwith armor-plates from four to six inches thick only, and with guns\r\nof small calibre and power. They may be left out of consideration in\r\ndealing with the present French navy. They were followed by six other\r\nvessels, also built of wood, but with upper works of iron, _viz._,\r\nthe _Océan_, _Marengo_, _Suffren_, _Richelieu_, _Colbert_, _Trident_.\r\nThey were armored with plates of a maximum thickness of 8½ inches,\r\nand carried four guns of 10¾ inches calibre, weighing 23 tons each,\r\nwith four 16-ton guns, and half a dozen light ones. They varied in\r\nsome particulars, ranging in tonnage from 7000 to 8000 tons, in\r\nhorse-power from 3600 to 4600, and in speed from 13 to 14½ knots. The\r\n_Friedland_ is another vessel which is frequently classed with the\r\nprevious six ships, the largest of which she generally resembles,\r\nbut she is built of iron, and carries eight 23-ton guns, and none\r\nof the 16-ton. A committee which sat in 1879, and which had for its\r\npresident and vice-presidents men no less eminent than the late M.\r\nGambetta and MM. Albert Grévy and Jules Ferry, pronounced these\r\nseven ships to be the strongest armored ships of the French navy\r\nthen in service. Such great advances have since been made, however,\r\nthat it is only necessary to add respecting these vessels that they\r\nwere nearly all single-screw ships, and that they carried their\r\nprincipal armament at broadside ports on the main-deck, and in raised\r\nbarbette towers placed at the four corners of the central battery.\r\nThe _Richelieu_ was the largest of these vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “COURBET” (FORMERLY THE “FOUDROYANT”): FRENCH\r\nARMORED SHIP OF THE FIRST CLASS.]\r\n\r\nNot one of the foregoing French ships of the early period conformed\r\nto conditions which were laid down officially in 1872 as those\r\nrequisite for first-class French iron-clads, _viz._, that they should\r\nbe constructed of iron (or steel), with water-tight compartments,\r\nbe armored with plates 12 inches thick, with decks from 2 to 2½\r\ninches thick, armed with guns of 24 centimetres calibre, commanding\r\ncertain prescribed ranges of fire, and furnished with spurs or ram\r\nstems. There were, however, four ships then under construction or\r\ntrial which did conform to the prescribed conditions, _viz._, the two\r\nalready spoken of—the _Courbet_ and _Dévastation_, and two others\r\nnamed the _Redoutable_ and the _Amiral Duperré_. With these powerful\r\nships may be said to have commenced the era of iron and steel\r\nline-of-battle ships in France. We will now bring them, together with\r\nstill more recent French ships of the first class, into a table in\r\nwhich their particulars may be conveniently grouped.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE A.—MODERN FRENCH ARMORED SHIPS OF THE FIRST CLASS.[24]\r\n\r\n              Part 1 of 2\r\n  +----------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n  |                |Displace-|Indicated| Speed  |         |          |\r\n  | NAME OF SHIP.  |  ment   | Horse-  |  in    | Length. | Breadth. |\r\n  |                | in tons.| power.  | Knots. |         |          |\r\n  |                |         |  [25]   |  [25]  |         |          |\r\n  +----------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n  |                |         |         |        |  Feet.  |   Feet.  |\r\n  | Amiral Baudin  | 11,200  |  8,320  |  15    |   319   |   70     |\r\n  | Amiral Duperré | 10,300  |  8,120  |  14.2  |   319   |   70     |\r\n  | Dévastation    |  9,900  |  8,320  |  14.5  |   312   |   69.8   |\r\n  |                |         |         |        |         |          |\r\n  | Formidable     | 11,260  |  8,320  |  15    |   319   |   70     |\r\n  | Foudroyant    }|  9,500  |  8,200  |  15    |   311   |   69.8   |\r\n  |  (now Courbet)}|         |         |        |         |          |\r\n  | Hoche          | 10,480  |  5,500  |  14    |   329   |   66     |\r\n  | Magenta        | 10,480  |  5,500  |  14    |   329   |   66     |\r\n  | Marceau        | 10,480  |  5,500  |  14    |   329   |   66     |\r\n  | Neptune        | 10,480  |  5,500  |  14    |   329   |   66     |\r\n  | Redoutable     |  9,030  |  6,000  |  14.2  |   312   |   64.6   |\r\n  |                |         |         |        |         |          |\r\n  | Caïman         |  7,200  |  4,800  |  14    |   271   |   59     |\r\n  | Furieux        |  5,700  |  3,400  |  12    |   248   |   59     |\r\n  | Indomptable    |  7,200  |  4,800  |  14    |   271   |   59     |\r\n  | Requin         |  7,200  |  6,000  |  14.5  |   271   |   59     |\r\n  | Terrible       |  7,200  |  4,800  |  14    |   271   |   59     |\r\n  | Tonnant        |  4,707  |  1,750  |  10    |   248   |   58.4   |\r\n  +----------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n\r\n                  Part 2 of 2\r\n      +----------------+---------+-----------+----------------+\r\n      |                | Draught |  Maximum  | Heaviest Guns  |\r\n      | NAME OF SHIP.  |   of    | Thickness |    carried.    |\r\n      |                |  Water. | of Armor. |                |\r\n      +----------------+---------+-----------+----------------+\r\n      |                |  Feet.  |  Inches.  |                |\r\n      | Amiral Baudin  |   25.8  |    22     |  3 of 75 tons. |\r\n      | Amiral Duperré |   25.8  |    22     |  4 ”  48  ”    |\r\n      | Dévastation    |   25.5  |    15     | {4 ”  48  ”    |\r\n      |                |         |           | {4 ”  28  ”    |\r\n      | Formidable     |   25.8  |    22     |  3 ”  75  ”    |\r\n      | Foudroyant    }|   25.5  |    15     | {4 ”  48  ”    |\r\n      |  (now Courbet)}|         |           | {4 ”  28  ”    |\r\n      | Hoche          |   26.5  |    17.7   |  4 ”  52  ”    |\r\n      | Magenta        |   26.5  |    17.7   |  4 ”  52  ”    |\r\n      | Marceau        |   26.5  |    17.7   |  4 ”  52  ”    |\r\n      | Neptune        |   26.5  |    17.7   |  4 ”  52  ”    |\r\n      | Redoutable     |   24.4  |    14     | {4 ”  28  ”    |\r\n      |                |         |           | {4 ”  24  ”    |\r\n      | Caïman         |   23    |    17.5   |  2 ”  48  ”    |\r\n      | Furieux        |   21.4  |    17.5   |  2 ”  48  ”    |\r\n      | Indomptable    |   22.8  |    19.5   |  2 ”  75  ”    |\r\n      | Requin         |   22.8  |    19.5   |  2 ”  75  ”    |\r\n      | Terrible       |   22.8  |    19.5   |  2 ”  75  ”    |\r\n      | Tonnant        |   17.3  |    17.5   |  2 ”  48  ”    |\r\n      +----------------+---------+-----------+----------------+\r\n\r\nThe ship which alphabetically falls last in this table among the\r\nships of 9000 tons and upwards, the _Redoutable_, came first in point\r\nof time, _viz._, in 1872, and her design marked the commencement of\r\nthe new era in French iron-clad construction. One of the features\r\nof the change was, as already intimated, the abandonment of wooden\r\nhulls, which we had succeeded in accomplishing in England eight years\r\nbefore. The first design proposed by myself to the British Admiralty\r\nprovided for an iron hull, and although the force of circumstances\r\ncompelled us to construct my earliest war-vessels in timber, yet so\r\nstrongly averse were we to the employment of so perishable a material\r\nas wood within an iron casing that Admiral Sir R. Spencer Robinson\r\nsucceeded in preventing the construction of three out of five wooden\r\nline-of-battle armored ships that had previously been proposed by the\r\ngovernment of the day, and sanctioned by Parliament. This was in\r\n1863 or 1864, the _Lord Clyde_ and _Lord Warden_ being the last large\r\narmored wooden ships laid down in her Majesty’s dockyards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “RICHELIEU.”]\r\n\r\nThe French delayed the change for some years, as we see. M. De Bussy,\r\nthe designer of the _Redoutable_, and a most accomplished naval\r\nconstructor, built a very large part of the ship of steel, and by\r\nso doing brought the French dockyards into early acquaintance with\r\nthe superiority of that material to iron for constructive purposes.\r\nThe _Redoutable_ has armor of more than 14 inches in thickness upon\r\nher belt, and of 9½ inches upon her central battery. She carries\r\neight 25-ton guns[26]—four in her central battery, two in barbette\r\nhalf-towers, and two on revolving platforms at the bow and stern\r\nrespectively. She also carries eight light 5½-inch guns. This ship\r\ngenerally resembles her successors, the _Dévastation_ and the\r\n_Foudroyant_ (by the same designer), in so far as that her batteries\r\nfire past sides, with great tumble home.\r\n\r\nLord Brassey (in this respect somewhat erroneously following Mr.\r\nKing, of the United States navy, in his able work upon “The War-ships\r\nand Navies of the World”), says, “The faculty of firing parallel to\r\nthe line of keel is secured in the French ship by the tumble home of\r\nthe ship’s sides, and not by the projection of the battery beyond\r\nthem, as in the English vessel (the _Audacious_).” It is difficult\r\nto understand what this means, because it is obviously only by the\r\nprojection of the battery beyond the sides of the ship which are\r\nbefore and after it that fore and aft fire can be obtained from the\r\nbattery in either case. But it is not true that the battery of the\r\n_Audacious_, any more than the battery of the _Redoutable_, projects\r\nbeyond the breadth of the ship at the water-line, which would seem\r\nto be what is intended, and Lord Brassey may assure himself of\r\nthe fact by looking at Plate III. of his own work on “The British\r\nNavy,” from which the above words are quoted. The _Redoutable_ is a\r\nfull-rigged ship, and nevertheless steams 14¼ knots per hour. There\r\nis one particular in which the _Dévastation_ and the _Foudroyant_,\r\nlike her as they are in general design, differ materially from the\r\n_Redoutable_. I refer to the armament. The former two ships each\r\ncarry four 34-centimetre 48-ton guns in the main-deck battery, in\r\nlieu of the four 25-ton guns of the _Redoutable_.\r\n\r\nThe _Amiral Duperré_ (designed by M. Sabattier, the able French\r\nchief constructor) claims a few words, as she differs materially\r\nin type from the three ships just discussed. She has a complete\r\nbelt of very thick armor from stem to stern—greatest thickness 22\r\ninches, tapering to 10 inches at the extremities, with a thick deck\r\n(2 inches) at the top of the belt in the usual manner. But above\r\nthis belt there is no armored main-deck battery, as in the other\r\nships, the chief armament, of four 48-ton guns, being carried in four\r\nelevated barbette towers, two of which are well forward, and project\r\nconsiderably to enable their guns to act efficiently as bow-chasers,\r\nand at the same time to command all round the broadside and right\r\nastern. To facilitate this the sides of the ship have great tumble\r\nhome. The other two towers are situated at the middle line of the\r\nship, one near the stern, and the other farther forward, between the\r\nmain and the mizzen masts. The main-deck, although without armor\r\ndefence, is not without armament, as it carries fourteen 5½-inch\r\n60-pounder rifled breech-loaders. Other particulars of the _Amiral\r\nDuperré_ are given in the table, and on page 81 is a view of her,\r\nengraved from a photograph with which I have been favored by a French\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed from her description that the most characteristic\r\nfeature of this great ship of more than 10,000 tons is the absence\r\nof any guns protected by armor. The barbette towers, it is true,\r\nare armored with 12-inch plates, and the main-deck guns are under\r\nthe protection of the thin plating of the ship’s side, which latter\r\nis of little or no avail, however, against the armament of other\r\nfirst-class ships. Practically the whole of the _Duperré’s_ guns are\r\nunprotected. It may be added that during the discussions in London\r\nupon the “ships armored in places” an attempt was made to show that\r\nthe _Duperré_, owing to her alleged small initial stability, was as\r\ndevoid of stability when injured above the belt as certain vessels of\r\nthe British _Admiral_ class when injured before and abaft the belt—a\r\nstatement which I distrust, as I regard it as a mere inference from\r\nan experiment which I believe to be delusive. At the same time, the\r\n_Duperré_ would have been the better for more initial stability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “AMIRAL DUPERRÉ:” FRENCH ARMORED SHIP OF THE FIRST\r\nCLASS.]\r\n\r\nBut it is obvious that all belted or partially belted vessels, in\r\nwhich the belt is carried but a small height above the water for\r\nthe size of the ship, must run the risk of losing both buoyancy and\r\nstability very soon if even moderately inclined in or after battle,\r\nseeing that, with a moderate inclination only, the entire armor-belt\r\non the depressed side of the ship must disappear beneath the sea’s\r\nsurface. The strenuous assertion of this source of danger, although\r\nit could not lead to much increase in the stability of the existing\r\narmored ships, has produced as one effect the busy and earnest\r\nefforts which both English and French constructors have been recently\r\nmaking to subdivide their ships _above the armor_ into as many\r\nwater-tight compartments as possible, and to stuff these compartments\r\nas full as possible of buoyant (or at least of water-excluding)\r\nmaterials. The necessity for resorting to this device, however, in\r\nfirst-class ships of nine, ten, or eleven thousand tons displacement,\r\nand of something approaching to five million dollars each in value,\r\nis not a thing for either French or English naval constructors to\r\nbe proud of. But the assertion of the danger in question has had in\r\nEngland the further and very satisfactory result of bringing much\r\nmore trustworthy ships, like the _Nile_ and _Trafalgar_, into being,\r\nand of insuring the determined support of these ships in Parliament\r\nwhenever those who foolishly confound mere cheapness with merit in\r\nsuch constructions seek to interfere with the progress of these\r\nmagnificent vessels.\r\n\r\nTwo other powerful ships of the French navy, closely resembling the\r\n_Amiral Duperré_, are the _Amiral Baudin_ and the _Formidable_. They\r\nare of 3¼ feet more beam than the _Duperré_ (and therefore probably\r\nhave much larger stability), and their displacement exceeds hers by\r\n900 tons. Their armaments chiefly differ from hers in the employment\r\nof three guns of 75 tons each in their towers, in lieu of the four\r\nguns of 48 tons of the _Duperré_. The _Neptune_, _Hoche_, _Magenta_,\r\nand _Marceau_ are four other powerful ships, as will have been seen\r\nfrom Table A, the principal armament of each consisting of four guns\r\nof 52 tons, carried in towers, with the exception of the _Hoche_,\r\nwhich has two of her four principal guns of 28 tons each only.\r\n\r\nIncidental mention has already been made on page 76 of two ships,\r\nthe _Caïman_ and _Indomptable_, which, although of only 7200 tons,\r\ncarry very thick armor (19½ inches), and as a matter of fact carry\r\nalso guns of the heaviest type (75-ton). There are two other vessels\r\nof the same description, the _Terrible_ and _Requin_. Careful note\r\nshould be taken of these four steel-built vessels, which add greatly\r\nto the power of France. Each carries two of the very powerful guns\r\njust mentioned, and steams at a speed of 14½ knots. In the same\r\ncategory of thickly armored ships the French have yet one other ship,\r\nthe _Furieux_, of 5560 tons. Her armor is 17½ inches thick in places,\r\nand she is armed with two 48-ton guns. Her speed is 12 knots. The\r\n_Tonnant_ has the same armor and armament, but she is of nearly 1000\r\ntons less displacement, drawing much less water, and steaming only at\r\n10 knots per hour.\r\n\r\nWe may sum up the facts relating to the larger class of French\r\niron-clads which still rank among the efficient ships of 7000 tons\r\nand upward by saying that, in addition to the sixteen ships of which\r\nthe particulars are given in Table A, there are on the efficient list\r\nthe _Colbert_, _Friedland, arengo_, _Océan_, _Richelieu_, _Suffren_,\r\n_Trident_, _Savoie_, _Revanche_, _Surveillante_, and _Héroïne_, most\r\nof which have been previously described in general terms, and the\r\nremainder of which are of less than 6000 tons, and were built chiefly\r\nof wood many years ago.\r\n\r\nThe French navy further comprises thirteen armor-plated cruisers, of\r\nwhich four have lately been dropped out of some official lists. Of\r\nthe remaining nine, four are modern vessels, and all of about equal\r\nsize and power. These are the _Duguesclin_, _Vauban_, _Bayard_, and\r\n_Turenne_; but of these, while the first two are built of steel,\r\nthe last two are built of wood, with iron topsides, as are all the\r\nremaining five vessels of this class.

The _Duguesclin_\r\nand her sister ships are of the _Duperré_ type, much reduced in\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nThere are nine completed coast-guard iron-clads and eight armored\r\ngun-boats in the French navy, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE C.—FRENCH IRON-CLAD COAST-GUARD VESSELS.\r\n\r\n  +---------------+-----------+--------+---------+-------------+\r\n  | NAME OF SHIP. | Displace- | Speed. | Maximum |  Principal  |\r\n  |               |   ment.   |        |  Armor. |    Guns.    |\r\n  +---------------+-----------+--------+---------+-----+-------+\r\n  |               |  Tons.    | Knots. | Inches. | No. | Tons. |\r\n  | Fulminant     |   5600    |  13.22 |   13    |  2  |  28   |\r\n  | Tonnerre      |   5700    |  14    |   13    |  2  |  28   |\r\n  | Tempête       |   4523    |  12    |   13    |  2  |  28   |\r\n  | Vengeur       |   4523    |  10.8  |   13    |  2  |  48   |\r\n  | Bélier        |   3600    |  12.3  |    8.5  |  2  |  16   |\r\n  | Bouledogue    |   3800    |  12.25 |    8.5  |  2  |  16   |\r\n  | Cerbère       |   3800    |  11.4  |    8.5  |  2  |  16   |\r\n  | Taureau       |   2700    |  13    |    6    |  1  |  23   |\r\n  | Tigre         |   3500    |  13.5  |    8.5  |  2  |  16   |\r\n  +---------------+-----------+--------+---------+-----+-------+\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE D.—FRENCH IRON-CLAD GUN-BOATS.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+-----------+--------+---------+-------------+\r\n  |   NAME OF SHIP.   | Displace- | Speed. | Maximum |  Principal  |\r\n  |                   |   ment.   |        |  Armor. |    Guns.    |\r\n  +-------------------+-----------+--------+---------+-----+-------+\r\n  |                   |  Tons.    | Knots. | Inches. | No. | Tons. |\r\n  |       { Achéron   |   1639    |  13    |    8    |  1  |  28   |\r\n  | First { Cocyte    |   1639    |  13    |    8    |  1  |  28   |\r\n  | Class.{ Phlegéton |   1639    |  13    |    8    |  1  |  28   |\r\n  |       { Styx      |   1639    |  13    |    8    |  1  |  28   |\r\n  |                   |           |        |         |     |       |\r\n  |       { Flamme    |   1045    |  13    |    8    |  1  |  16   |\r\n  | Second{ Fusée     |   1045    |  13    |    8    |  1  |  16   |\r\n  | Class.{ Mitraille |   1045    |  13    |    8    |  1  |  16   |\r\n  |       { Grenade   |   1045    |  13    |    8    |  1  |  16   |\r\n  +-------------------+-----------+--------+---------+-----+-------+\r\n\r\nThe vessels in the tables C and D are all revolving-turret vessels,\r\nwith the exception of the _Taureau_ and of the four second-class\r\ngun-boats, which fire their guns _en barbette_. They embrace very\r\ndifferent types of construction, involving different degrees of\r\nsea-worthiness—very low degrees in some of them, I fear. With the\r\nexception of the _Tempête_, they are all furnished with twin screws.\r\nThe _Fulminant_, _Tonnerre_, _Tempête_, and _Vengeur_, in Table C,\r\nand the whole of the vessels in Table D (as yet incomplete), are\r\nof iron or of steel, or of the two combined; the remainder have\r\nhulls principally built of wood. I have chosen for illustration the\r\nturret-vessel _Vengeur_, as seen on page 87, which has been engraved\r\nfrom a photograph sent to me by a naval friend in France.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the unarmored ships of France, and as in writing of\r\nthese I purpose accepting the official classifications adopted in\r\nFrance, which are not identical with those employed in England, it\r\nmay be well to repeat here a caution which the British Admiralty\r\nhas given in a memorandum prefixed to a recent “return” of theirs\r\n“showing the fleets of England, France, Russia, Germany, Italy,\r\nAustria, and Greece.” The caution is to the effect that France\r\nincludes under the heading of “cruisers” vessels of about similar\r\nvalue to the larger class of English sloops, which are excluded from\r\nthe English “cruiser” class. But I regret the necessity of observing\r\nthat the Admiralty officers, while careful to put this explanation\r\nwell forward, appear to be equally careful to withhold an explanation\r\nof much greater moment concerning three French cruisers of large size\r\nand of greater importance—withheld in pursuance, apparently, and as\r\nI have most reluctantly come to fear, of an uncandid, and indeed of\r\na misleading spirit, which seems to have taken possession of some\r\npersons who have to do with the preparation of Admiralty returns to\r\nParliament. The exercise of this spirit has forced me ere now to draw\r\nthe attention of Parliament to the matter, and in one instance to\r\nhave an official return, which contained erroneous and too favorable\r\nclassifications of British ships, withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAny one referring to the Parliamentary return of British and foreign\r\nfleets just adverted to will find under the heading of “Unarmored\r\nVessels Building” two large and remarkably fast steel cruisers, the\r\n_Tage_ and the _Cécile_, the former of which exceeds 7000 tons in\r\ndisplacement, while the latter approaches 6000 tons, and both of\r\nwhich are to steam at the immense speed of 19 knots an hour, or a\r\nknot in excess of the fastest armed vessel (neglecting torpedo craft)\r\nin the British navy. These two French cruisers are respectively 390\r\nand 380 feet in length, and are to be driven by over 10,000 indicated\r\nhorse-power in the _Tage_, and by nearly 10,000 indicated horse-power\r\nin the _Cécile_. A third vessel, the _Sfax_, launched at Brest in\r\n1884, of 4420 tons, 7500 indicated horse-power, and 16½ knots speed,\r\nis also given without remark in the Parliamentary return as an\r\n“unarmored” vessel. Now even this last-named vessel has a steel deck\r\none and three-fourths inches thick to protect her boilers, machinery,\r\nand magazines, while the _Tage_ and _Cécile_ have such decks three\r\ninches thick. These, being mere decks, do not, of course, remove\r\nthe ships out of the category of unarmored ships, and the return is\r\ncorrect in this respect. But now in this same return all the British\r\nships provided with protecting decks of this character are kept out\r\nof the lists of unarmored or “unprotected” vessels, and are classed\r\nseparately, and are described as “protected” vessels. And not only is\r\nthis true of vessels like the _Mersey_ class, which have such decks\r\ntwo and one-half inches thick in places, but it is true likewise of\r\nsome twenty vessels, ranging, many of them, as low as 1420 tons in\r\ndisplacement, and with decks and partial decks of less thickness than\r\nthat of the _Sfax_, the weakest of the three French ships in this\r\nrespect. In short, while the twenty-two English ships are withheld\r\nfrom the category of unarmored ships, although every one of them is\r\ninferior in protecting decks to the three French ships, the latter\r\nare placed in the inferior category, and not a word of explanation\r\nis offered to prevent the uninitiated and unsuspecting reader from\r\nregarding as weaker than our vessels those French vessels which\r\nare in fact the strongest and best protected. I must say that, as\r\nan Englishman, I grieve to see returns to the British Parliament\r\nmade use of for the dissemination of information so misleading as\r\nthis; and I should do so if I could believe there was nothing but\r\nofficial negligence involved; but I am sorry to say I cannot doubt\r\nthat had the mere reproduction of foreign classifications put three\r\nof the very fastest and most important cruisers of our own navy, of\r\nAdmiralty origin, at the very great disadvantage to which the French\r\nships are put in this return, we should have had a very full and a\r\nvery prominent explanation of the seeming discrepancy given. It is\r\nto the credit of _Lloyd’s Register_ office that what the Admiralty\r\nOffice failed to do in a paper issued at the end of July was properly\r\ndone in their _Universal Register_, published two or three months\r\nearlier; for in the latter the three French ships are separately\r\ndetailed under the heading of “Deck-protected Cruisers.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “VENGEUR:” FRENCH IRON-CLAD COAST-GUARD VESSEL.]\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to bring to light the matter just\r\nexplained, for otherwise the present state and the prospects of the\r\nFrench navy cannot be properly understood, the _Tage_, _Cécile_, and\r\n_Sfax_ being, on the whole, the most important of the French ships\r\nwhich are without armor-belts. Two others there are, however, which\r\nare weaker than the _Tage_ and _Sfax_ only in the fact of their being\r\nwithout special deck protection. These are the _Duquesne_ and the\r\n_Tourville_, two ships approximately alike in size and construction,\r\nand both having their iron bottoms sheathed with two thicknesses of\r\nwood and then coppered, after the manner introduced by myself in\r\nH.M.S. _Inconstant_. Both of these French ships have attained 16-9/10\r\nknots of speed. They are armed with seven guns of eight tons and\r\nfourteen of three tons weight.\r\n\r\nThe remaining unarmored vessels of France must be rapidly summarized.\r\nIt is impossible to neglect in this case, as was done in my article\r\non the British navy, all the frigates, etc., which have frames of\r\ntimber, because to do this would be to omit all unarmored frigates of\r\nthe French navy except the _Duquesne_ and the _Tourville_, already\r\ndescribed. But it is not necessary to do more than name the _Venus_,\r\n_Minerve_, and _Flora_, all launched prior to 1870, and all slow,\r\nand to say that there remain but four unarmored wood frigates of 14\r\nknots speed, of about 3400 tons, and armed with from two to four\r\nguns of five tons, and eighteen to twenty-two guns of three tons.\r\nThese are _Aréthuse_, _Dubourdieu_, _Iphigénie_, and _Naïade_,\r\nwhich, although wooden ships, have all been launched since 1881—the\r\n_Dubourdieu_ in 1884. Of French first-class cruisers which do not\r\nrank as frigates (having no main-deck batteries) there are nine in\r\nnumber, all built of wood except one, the _Duguay-Trouin_, which is\r\nthe fastest of them all, steaming at 15-9/10 knots. This vessel has\r\n3300 tons displacement, and is armed with five guns of eight tons and\r\nfive of three tons. None of the remaining eight exceed 2400 tons in\r\ndisplacement, none exceed 15.3 knots in speed (but none are less than\r\n14 knots), and each of them carries fifteen guns of three tons. Next\r\ncome thirteen second-class cruisers, ranging in displacement between\r\n1540 and 2100 tons, and in speed between 11½ and 15 knots; they are\r\nprincipally armed with 3-ton guns. There is another vessel, the\r\n_Rapide_, in this class, but I only know of her that her tonnage is\r\n1900 tons. Of cruisers of the third class there are fifteen, ranging\r\nfrom 1000 to 1400 tons, and principally armed with 3-ton guns. Their\r\nspeeds vary from 10 to 13 knots; one, however, the _Hirondelle_,\r\nsteaming at 15½ knots. The French have likewise thirty-five vessels,\r\n“avisos,” etc., of which about one-half are from 1400 to 1600 tons,\r\nand the remainder are from 720 to 1000 tons. About six of them\r\nreach or approach 13 knots, but most of them range between 10 and\r\n11 knots, some of them falling as low as 8 knots. I have further to\r\nmake mention of two very fast vessels—for they are to steam 19½\r\nknots—now under construction, named the _Surcoup_ and the _Forbin_,\r\neach of 1850 tons, and each armed with two 3-ton guns. There is\r\nalso a vessel of 1540 tons, named the _Milan_, which steams 18\r\nknots, and is armed with five very light (24-cwt.) guns. The French\r\nnavy possesses also ninety-nine vessels, most of them carrying guns\r\n(many of 3 tons, some of 5 tons, and one or two of 8 tons), and also\r\ntwenty-eight steam transports, varying in size from 1200 to nearly\r\n6000 tons, the largest of them, the _Nive_ (of 5680 tons), steaming\r\n14 knots.\r\n\r\nThe navies of Europe, including the British navy, have undergone of\r\nlate considerable expansion in respect of their very fast unarmored\r\nsteel vessels, the designing and successful construction of which\r\nhave been brought about by improvements in the quality of ship\r\nsteel and in steam-machinery, notably as regards the latter, by the\r\nemployment of “forced draught.”[27] These are called torpedo-vessels,\r\nas distinct from torpedo-boats. There are in process of completion\r\nfor the British navy eight of 1630 tons (the _Archer_ class), each\r\ncarrying six 6-inch 5-ton guns, and estimated to steam with forced\r\ndraught from 16 to 17 knots; two of 1430 tons each (_Scout_ class),\r\ncarrying four 5-inch 2-ton guns, with an estimated maximum speed\r\nof 16 knots; and two of 785 tons (_Curlew_ class), called “gun and\r\ntorpedo” vessels; speed, 15 knots; armament, one 6-inch 89-cwt.\r\nand three 5-inch 36-cwt. guns. There is also a class of “torpedo\r\ngun-boats” (the official designation, but not one which expresses any\r\nvery manifest distinction from the last-named class), which are of\r\na very notable character. This (the _Grasshopper_) class, of which\r\neach vessel is of only 450 tons displacement, is to be supplied\r\nwith engines of 2700 indicated horse-power. The diagrams on page 90\r\nexhibit the general form and particulars of these very remarkable\r\nlittle vessels, which are expected to steam at fully 19 knots (22\r\nmiles) per hour. Against the above torpedo-vessels of the British\r\nnavy are to be set, in the French navy, four torpedo-cruisers of\r\n1280 tons, 17 knots speed, carrying each five 4-inch guns; and eight\r\ntorpedo despatch-vessels, each of 320 tons, and designed to steam at\r\n18 knots, carrying machine guns only; such machine guns being also\r\ncarried, of course, by all the fast torpedo-vessels and gun-boats,\r\nboth French and English, previously referred to, but in their cases\r\nin conjunction with their other guns. These 320-ton torpedo-vessels\r\nof France are to be driven by machinery of 1800 indicated horse-power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH TORPEDO GUN-BOAT OF THE “GRASSHOPPER” CLASS\r\n(SIDE VIEW).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “GRASSHOPPER”—PLAN OF UPPER DECK, POOP, AND\r\nFORECASTLE.]\r\n\r\nIt may be observed with regard to these small craft furnished with\r\nsuch enormous steam-power (in proportion to their size and tonnage)\r\nthat there is much uncertainty as to the speeds which they will\r\nattain. Not only are the builders without experience of similar\r\nvessels by which to guide themselves, but where the proportion of\r\npower to displacement is so great, slight differences both in hulls\r\nand machinery, no less than in immersion and trim, may produce\r\nunforeseen results. As designers who fail to realize promised speeds\r\nare liable to be discredited, while those whose vessels surpass their\r\npromised speeds may be unduly praised, it is but reasonable to expect\r\nthat the promised speeds will usually even be more than realized.\r\nThis has been the case with the _Bombe_, the first of the French\r\ntorpedo despatch-vessels which have been tried under steam, and\r\nwhich, under the promise of 18 knots, realized no less than 19½ knots\r\non the measured mile. It should be added that all of these extremely\r\nfast small craft in both navies are propelled by twin engines and\r\nscrews. As great public interest will be felt in the trials of these\r\nvery novel and special vessels—as mere steamers no less than as\r\nwar craft—it may be well to give their names, to facilitate their\r\nidentification hereafter.\r\n\r\n  ENGLISH TORPEDO GUN-BOATS: _Grasshopper_, _Rattlesnake_,\r\n  _Spider_, _Sandfly_—each having a displacement of 450 tons, 2700\r\n  horse-power, 200 feet length, 23 feet breadth, 8 feet draught, and\r\n  a speed estimated at 19 knots.\r\n\r\n  FRENCH TORPEDO DESPATCH-VESSELS: _Bombe_, _Couleuvrine_, _Dague_,\r\n  _Dragonne_, _Flèche_, _Lance_, _Saint-Barbe_, _Salve_—each having\r\n  a displacement of 320 tons, 1800 horse-power, 194.3 feet length,\r\n  21.4 feet breadth, 5.1 feet draught, and, with the exception of the\r\n  _Bombe_, a speed estimated at 18 knots. The actual speed of the\r\n  _Bombe_ is 19.5 knots.\r\n\r\nBesides the above vessels, the two navies (English and French) are\r\nprovided as follows with torpedo-boats: The English have nine small\r\n(56 feet long) and slow (14½ to 15 knots) of wood; fifty small\r\n(60 to 66 feet long) and slow (15 to 16 knots) of steel; nineteen\r\nothers of greater length, but all less than 93 feet, and of speeds\r\nvarying from 16 to 19 knots; six of 100 to 113 feet, and 19 knots;\r\nfifty-three of 125 feet in length, and 19 knots; and two building,\r\n_viz._, one of 135 feet in length, and 22 knots, and one of 150\r\nfeet in length, and 20 knots; in all, one hundred and thirty-nine\r\ntorpedo-boats, of which the 135-feet boat carries four 3-pounder\r\nquick-firing guns, and the 150-feet boat carries five 6-pounder guns\r\nof that kind. The French have nine under 70 feet in length; forty-one\r\nunder 100 feet in length, steaming at 17 to 18 knots; eighteen of\r\n108 feet in length, somewhat faster; nine of 113 feet in length,\r\nsteaming at 22 knots; and fifty-one of 114 feet in length, steaming\r\nat 20 knots; in all, one hundred and twenty-eight torpedo-boats, all\r\narmed with machine guns only. As the nine slow wooden boats of the\r\nEnglish navy can hardly be regarded as torpedo-boats at all, it may\r\nbe said that of torpedo-boats, built and building, the English have\r\none hundred and thirty, and the French one hundred and twenty-eight,\r\nof which the English have seventy-nine completed, and fifty-one\r\nbuilding and completing, and the French have sixty-eight completed,\r\nand sixty building and completing. The English navy is therefore\r\nslightly, but only slightly, in advance of the French in the matter\r\nof torpedo-boats proper, while in respect of extremely fast sea-going\r\ntorpedo-vessels of 320 and 450 tons respectively, the English have\r\nthree under construction and one completed, while the French have one\r\n(the _Bombe_) completed and seven under construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the 150,000,000 francs appropriated in France this year for the\r\nconstruction of war-ships nearly nine-tenths were set aside, not\r\nfor the building of large armored vessels, but for the following\r\nfast cruisers and auxiliary classes: “Six cruisers, class I.,\r\n30,000,000 francs; ten cruisers, class II., 26,000,000 francs; twenty\r\ntorpedo-catchers, 12,000,000 francs; fifty gun-boats, 15,000,000\r\nfrancs; one hundred torpedo-boats, 25,000,000 francs; three\r\ncoast-defence vessels, 25,000,000 francs.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the late change in administration this seems to show\r\nthat the policy of Admiral Aube, referred to in the introductory\r\nchapter, is still potent, and that the government believes the next\r\nwar with England will be carried on by French cruisers attacking\r\nBritish commerce, and that sharp, destructive dashes will be made\r\nagainst the enemy’s coast by ships with great speed, and such\r\nsufficient power that “all of England’s littoral towns, fortified\r\nand unfortified, whether purely peace establishments or warlike,”\r\nwill be burned or pitilessly ransomed. “In any future war,” continues\r\nthis exponent of the new ideas, “France will come down from the\r\nheights of the cloudy sentimentality which has created that monstrous\r\nassociation of words, _rights_ of war, and her attack on every source\r\nof English riches will become not only legitimate but obligatory.”\r\n\r\nIt is certain that French naval activity is now mainly directed to\r\nthe construction of vessels just suited to these new theories. At\r\nthe same time she has a formidable fleet of heavily armored vessels,\r\na rough comparison with those of England being as follows, in the\r\nclasses which have over fifteen inches of armor protection and carry\r\nguns above forty-three tons in weight:\r\n\r\n  Ships.     Armor.               No. Guns.             Weight.\r\n    3      21½ inches      6 breech-loading rifles     75 tons.\r\n    5      20    ”         8       ”          ”        75  ”\r\n    6      18    ”         8       ”          ”        50  ”\r\n    2      15    ”        24       ”          ”        48  ”\r\n   --                     --\r\n   16                     46\r\n\r\nEngland has three ships with armor from twenty-four inches to\r\neighteen inches thick, and twelve ships with armor eighteen inches\r\nthick; three ships carry six 110-ton guns, six carry twenty-four\r\n67-ton guns, five carry sixteen 43-ton guns, all breech-loading\r\nrifles, while one has four muzzle-loading 80-ton guns.\r\n\r\nThe latest additions to the armored fleet of France are the _Hoche_,\r\nof the Marceau type of battle-ship, and the _Cocyte_ and _Mitraille_,\r\ncoast-defence gun-boats. The _Marceau_, launched May 24, 1887, is\r\nbuilt of steel with an under-water skin of iron; a double bottom\r\nextends below the engines, boilers, and magazines, and the hold is\r\ndivided into thirty-one water-tight compartments by horizontal and\r\nlongitudinal bulkheads. The armor-belt encircles the ship, dips\r\nforward to strengthen the ram, is carried twelve inches above the\r\nload water-line, and varies in thickness from 13.7 to 17.7 inches;\r\nthe barbette towers are 15.7 inches thick, and the armored deck,\r\nabove which there are many compartments, is 2.6 inches thick. The\r\narmament is made up of four 13-4/10-inch guns mounted in the towers,\r\nof one 5½-inch gun at the bow, and of sixteen 5½-inch pieces in\r\nbroadside; the secondary battery includes twenty Hotchkiss guns and\r\nfour above-water torpedo tubes.\r\n\r\nThe estimated horse-power is 8548 (not 5500 as stated on page 76)\r\nwith natural draft, and 12,000 with forced draft, the estimated speed\r\nbeing 16 knots, the coal capacity 800 tons, and the coal endurance\r\n1500 miles at full power and 3500 miles at 11 knots speed. The\r\n_Neptune_ and the _Hoche_, of the same general plans and dimensions,\r\nwere launched in the spring of this year. As originally designed\r\nthe _Hoche_ was expected to develop 16 knots and 7000 indicated\r\nhorse-power, but by the application of forced draft the speed was\r\nincreased to 17½ and the power to 12,000. The armament consists—not\r\nof the four 52-ton guns given in the table on page 76—but, as stated\r\nin the text, of two 13.4-inch guns (34 centimetre) mounted one in\r\neach of the midship turrets, of two 10.6-inch guns (27 centimetre)\r\ncarried one in each of the waist turrets, and of eighteen 5.5-inch\r\nguns (14 centimetre) so disposed in broadside within the unarmored\r\ncentral superstructure which occupies the deck between the turrets\r\nthat the forward and after pairs are given bow and stern fire\r\nrespectively. The armor-belt is similar to that of the _Marceau_, but\r\nthe protective deck is from 3.15 to 3.54 inches thick, and the heavy\r\ngun sites are protected by 15.75 inches of compound armor.\r\n\r\nThe _Amiral Courbet_ (formerly the _Foudroyant_) carries four\r\n10.6-inch, six 5.5-inch, and twelve rapid-fire guns. She developed\r\n6016 horse-power with natural and 8088 with forced draft, the mean\r\nspeed being 14.2 knots on a consumption of 2.35 pounds per power\r\neach hour. The _Indomptable_, _Requin_, _Caïman_, and _Terrible_ are\r\nsister battle-ships. They were originally laid down in 1877, and\r\nthe _Terrible_ was only completed ready for sea in 1887. They are\r\nconstructed like the _Marceau_, of iron and steel, the outer skin of\r\nthe under-water body being of the former metal; the compound armor\r\nis from 13 to 19⅝ inches in thickness, and carries five feet of its\r\nseven feet six inches width below the water-line. In each of two\r\npear-shaped barbette towers situated on the longitudinal midship\r\nline, and protected by 17¾ inches of armor, a 16.5-inch gun, with\r\nits axis twenty-one feet above the water is mounted; in addition\r\nthere are four 4-inch breech-loading rifles and a secondary battery\r\nof rapid-fire guns and torpedo-tubes. The _Indomptable_, launched\r\nin September, 1883, made in her trial trip in August, 1886, a speed\r\nof 15 knots, and is officially rated as having a sea speed of\r\n13.5 knots. All work upon the partially protected ships _Brennus_\r\nand _Charles Martel_ was stopped in 1886, and their specific\r\nappropriation has been transferred to the sum already assigned for\r\nthe construction of fast cruisers and torpedo-boats.\r\n\r\nThe _Cocyte_ and _Mitraille_ belong to a new class, or rather they\r\nrepresent a type which, after disappearing for a season of doubt and\r\ndenial, has had its value so much recognized that three Continental\r\nnations are giving it earnest study. A late French Minister of\r\nMarine asked within a year for money to construct fifty of these\r\ngun-boats, but was then refused the grant, a decision for which\r\nAdmiral Sir George Elliot thinks England ought to be very grateful.\r\nThis distinguished officer believes in the value of the type, and\r\nhopes that the Admiralty “will take note of the threat thus made”\r\nbefore the theory is allowed to prevail that adequate security can\r\nbe given to the British coasts by sea-going cruisers, submarine\r\nmines, shore batteries, and torpedo-boats. The boats present a small\r\ntarget, and give good armor protection to guns which, when the\r\nvessels are inshore or reinforced by land batteries, have sufficient\r\npower to keep battle-ships at a distance. They are very handy, have\r\ngood speed, and are economical, because for the same money they\r\ncan, as flotillas, bring into the action four times the gun-power\r\npossible in the large battle-ships. In France this type is divided\r\ninto two classes—the _Achéron_, _Cocyte_, _Phlegéton_, and _Styx_,\r\nof 1639 tons, belonging to the first, and the _Fusée_, _Grenade_,\r\n_Mitraille_, and _Flamme_, of 1045 tons, to the second. The iron and\r\nsteel hulls are extensively subdivided into water-tight compartments,\r\nand are protected by complete belts of steel armor at the water-line,\r\nand by arched steel-armored decks. The superstructures above the\r\nprotective decks have water-line belts of cellulose. The armament\r\nconsists of one heavy gun mounted in a barbette tower, and of a\r\nstrong secondary battery of machine guns and torpedoes.\r\n\r\nThe most important contributions to the sea-going navy of France\r\nare the cruisers. In the naval programme adopted after the war with\r\nGermany, ships of high speed were decided to be of such great value\r\nthat thirty-four—sixteen of the first and eighteen of the second\r\nclass—were provided for. At the present day French naval policy\r\nseems to pin its faith to fast cruisers, 5½-inch breech-loading guns,\r\nand torpedo-vessels. In pursuance of this belief the _Tage_, the\r\nlargest unarmored cruiser yet designed by any nation, was laid down\r\nin 1885; she is ship-rigged, has a complete under-water curved deck,\r\nlightly armored bulkheads forward and abaft the battery, a steel\r\nconning-tower, and heavily plated hatchways. A belt of cellulose\r\nalong the water-line, and the subdivision of the space above the\r\nprotective deck into water-tight compartments, will, it is claimed,\r\ninsure the safety of the ship in action. This employment of cellulose\r\nto stop leaks automatically was very successfully demonstrated in\r\nthe experiments made at Toulon with a target “composed of fourteen\r\nparts of cellulose and one part of cellulose in fibre, the whole\r\ncompressed into a felt-like mass, with a lining two feet thick. A\r\nshot seven and one-half inches in calibre was fired against this\r\ntarget at a distance to insure penetration. The result was not only\r\nsatisfactory but extraordinary. The shot, which carried away about\r\none-fifth of a cubic foot of the composition, had no sooner passed\r\nthrough than the cellulose closed up so firmly that a strong man was\r\nunable to insert his arm into the hole. A tank filled with water was\r\nthen hung against the place where the shot had entered, and after an\r\ninterval of fifteen minutes water began to trickle through, but not\r\nmore than a man with a bucket could easily intercept. As soon as the\r\ncomposition became thoroughly soaked, it offered increased resistance\r\nto the entrance of the water, which eventually ceased to flow, and\r\nthe breach was closed automatically. The results were the same where\r\nshells were used instead of shot, and red-hot coals were heaped upon\r\nthe composition without causing its ignition.”[28]\r\n\r\nThe twin-screw cruiser _Cecile_, which was designed before the\r\n_Tage_, and is somewhat smaller, illustrates the principle of\r\nduality in construction; the two main engines are situated in\r\nseparate compartments, and the six boilers are arranged in three\r\ndifferent groups. The sail area is 2153 square yards, and the steel\r\nlower masts serve as ventilators to the hold, and carry steel\r\ncrow’s-nests in which are mounted rapid fire and machine guns. The\r\nprimary batteries of the two ships are similar, each carrying six\r\n6¼-inch guns on the spar-deck (one forward, one aft, and four on\r\nsponsons) and ten 5½-inch pieces on the covered deck in broadside.\r\nThe secondary battery of the _Cecile_ consists of ten 37-millimetre\r\n(1.45-inch) guns, and that of the _Tage_ of three 47-millimetre\r\n(1.85-inch) rapid-fire guns, and twelve 37-millimetre revolving\r\ncannon—all of the Hotchkiss pattern. Both ships are supplied with\r\nabove-water torpedo tubes, the former having four, the latter seven.\r\nThe estimated maximum speed of the _Tage_ is 19 knots, with 10,330\r\nhorse-power, and that of the _Cecile_ is 18½ knots, with 9600\r\nhorse-power. The latest cruisers laid down are the _Jean Bart_ and\r\nthe _Dupuy de Lôme_, the first bearing the name of the rugged old\r\nsea-wolf who entered the navy as an apprentice and died a famous\r\nadmiral, and the other that of the constructor who designed both in\r\nwood and iron the first steam line-of-battle ships. These vessels are\r\nof 352 feet length, 43.6 feet beam, 18 feet 10 inches mean draught,\r\nand 4162 tons displacement; their estimated maximum speed is 19\r\nknots. The main battery is composed of four 6.3-inch guns mounted on\r\nsponsons, and of six 5.5-inch carried in broadside, and the secondary\r\narmament has six 37-millimetre revolving cannons, four 3-pounder\r\nrapid-fire guns, and the usual torpedo tubes.\r\n\r\nThe _Alger_ and _Isly_ are similar in construction to the _Cecile_,\r\nbut have the dimensions and armament of the _Jean Bart_; they are\r\ndesigned for 19 knots, and a coal endurance of 3600 miles at 13\r\nknots. The _Mogador_ is a rapid cruiser of 4325 tons, and of nearly\r\nsimilar design, armament, speed, and endurance as the above. The\r\n_Chanzy_, _Davoust_, and _Suchet_ belong to the same class of\r\n“croiseurs à barbette,” and are of 3027 tons displacement, with an\r\nestimated speed of 20 knots.\r\n\r\nThe _Surcoup_ and _Forbin_ illustrate another favorite type of\r\ncruiser. They are 311 feet 7 inches long, have 30 feet 6 inches\r\nbeam, and on a mean draught of 13 feet 11 inches displace 1848 tons.\r\nThe hull weighs 817 tons, and the engines (with boilers filled) 544\r\ntons; the coal capacity is 200 tons, and the endurance 2400 miles at\r\n10 knots. The engines are expected, with forced draft, to develop\r\n6000 indicated horse-power and 19.5 knots. They have a four-masted\r\nschooner rig, spread 7255.5 square feet of canvas, and carry a\r\ncomplement of one hundred and fifty officers and men. The battery\r\nconsists of two 5.5-inch guns on the upper deck, three 47-millimetre\r\nrapid-fire guns on the poop and forecastle, four 37-millimetre\r\nHotchkiss revolving cannon on the rail, and five torpedo launching\r\ntubes—two firing ahead, one astern, and one on each beam. This\r\nlightness of battery and small coal capacity indicate with great\r\nprecision how much weight-carrying power has been sacrificed to spars\r\nand sails. The _Coetlogon_ and _Cosmao_ laid down this year are of\r\nthe same type.\r\n\r\nWishing to obtain a small class of steel cruisers, the French\r\ngovernment lately invited the leading ship-builders to send in\r\ncompetitive designs for a vessel which at an extreme draught aft\r\nof fourteen feet would on the least possible displacement sustain\r\nwith natural draft a speed of eighteen knots for twelve hours, and\r\nwith forced draft a speed of nineteen knots for two hours. The coal\r\nendurance was to be 2400 miles at ten knots, the main battery to\r\ninclude two 5.5-inch guns, and the protective steel deck to be 1.6\r\ninch thick. Five competitors furnished plans, and finally those of\r\nthe Société de la Gironde were chosen, and the two vessels now known\r\nas the _Troude_ and the _Lalande_ were laid down. Their principal\r\ndimensions are, length 311 feet 7 inches, beam 31 feet, mean draught\r\n14 feet, and displacement 1877 tons. The armament will be two\r\n5.5-inch and three rapid-fire guns, four 37-millimetre revolving\r\ncannon, and a supply of torpedo tubes. The vessels, as with the\r\n_Surcoup_ type to which they are very similar, will have a fore and\r\naft rig and a complement of one hundred and sixty.\r\n\r\nThe _Duguesclin_, referred to on page 84, is an armored cruiser built\r\nof steel and iron and sheathed with wood and coppered; an iron armor\r\nbelt 9⅛ to 6½ inches thick encircles her, and the four barbettes are\r\nprotected by 8 inches of compound armor. The armament consists of\r\nfour 9.45-inch guns in the barbettes, of one 7.5-inch gun in the bow,\r\nand of six 5.5-inch pieces on broadside, in addition to two 6-pounder\r\nrapid-fire guns, twelve revolving cannon, and two above-water torpedo\r\ntubes. Her displacement is 5869 tons, draught 23 feet 3 inches, and\r\nshe has developed 4100 horse-power and 14 knots. The _Sfax_ is a\r\npartially protected steel cruiser, which is sheathed with wood and\r\ncoppered, and has an under-water curved steel protective deck 1.5\r\ninches thick. There is the usual water-tight subdivision below and\r\nabove this deck, together with the lately adopted cellulose belt. The\r\narmament consists of six 6.3-inch guns, four mounted on sponsons,\r\nwith bow and stern fire, and two in recessed ports with bow and beam\r\nfire; of ten 5.5-inch guns in broadside on the main deck, and of\r\neight Hotchkiss revolving cannon. In May, 1887,[29] “with natural\r\ndraft, the mean indicated horse-power developed for four hours was\r\n4333, and the speed 15.9 knots. With forced draft the mean results\r\nof a six hours’ trial were, indicated horse-power, 6034; revolutions,\r\n78; mean speed, 16.84 knots. The trials for coal endurance showed\r\nthat with full natural draft speed the consumption was 1.96 pounds\r\nper hour per indicated horse-power developed, and with forced draft\r\nit was 2.10 pounds. During these trials the draught of water was 19\r\nfeet 4 inches forward and 25 feet 1 inch aft, which was in excess\r\nof the normal designed draughts of 19 feet 8 inches and 24 feet 8\r\ninches. Notwithstanding this fact, and the fact of the indicated\r\nhorse-power falling much below the estimated power of the engines\r\n(5000 with natural, 7500 with forced draft), the speed realized\r\nexceeded the maximum estimated of 16.5 knots.”\r\n\r\nFrance has been very active in the construction of torpedo-vessels.\r\nOn the present plane to which the science of naval warfare has\r\nadvanced the great tactical question is whether torpedo-boats or\r\nflotillas are, in high-sea duels or engagements, to take the place of\r\nhuge ships or large fleets. There are, even in France, very marked\r\ndifferences of opinion upon this point, but so far as official policy\r\nand programme can assert a belief, there is no other nation, Russia\r\nalone excepted, which appears to hold the torpedo in such high\r\nesteem. The manœuvres of 1886 were notable for the prominence given\r\nto that type, and of the forty vessels assembled this year for drill\r\nand instruction at Toulon, twenty-one were torpedo craft of some\r\nkind. The French navy has over two hundred torpedo-boats, which vary\r\nin length from seventy to one hundred and thirty-three feet, and in\r\nspeed from fifteen to twenty-three knots; England has one hundred\r\nand eighty-one, of which eighty-eight are built and ninety-three\r\nare under construction; these differ as much among themselves as\r\nthe French boats, their speed range being about the same, and their\r\nlengths varying from sixty-three to one hundred and fifty feet.\r\nGenerally described torpedo-boats may be divided into two classes,\r\nthe first including such as are of a size to keep the sea and act\r\nindependently, and the second those carried by ships. The Whitehead\r\ntorpedoes, the type most generally used, are ejected from their\r\nfiring tubes by various means, slow burning powder being employed\r\nin some cases, though more frequently compressed air or steam. The\r\nsuccess of the French boats in China has revived the use of the spar\r\ntorpedo in combination with the locomotive type, and with us the\r\npromised success of the Howell design may cause another revolution in\r\nthis system of attack.\r\n\r\n“Boats exceeding one hundred feet in length,” writes White, “have\r\nbeen shown capable of making long sea-voyages unaccompanied, and\r\nthe fact has been seized upon by enthusiasts in torpedo warfare\r\nlike the late Gabriel Charmes as evidence that the days of the\r\narmored ship, of the large and costly cruiser, were numbered. Actual\r\nexperience is not favorable to this extreme view. There is a clear\r\nand marked distinction between the capability of making long sea\r\npassages in safety, when specially prepared for the purpose, and the\r\nsure sea-going qualities of large ships. Boats of the largest size\r\nand small swift vessels cannot equal large vessels in the power of\r\nmaintaining their speed and fighting efficiency or rough war. Life\r\nis scarcely endurable for long periods in these overturning boats\r\nand small craft, cooking is often a difficulty, and it is not every\r\nofficer who can rival the foreign commander of a torpedo-boat I\r\nonce met, who had acquired the power of living for long periods on\r\nsherry and eggs. M. Weyl stated a fact when he said of the grand\r\nmanœuvres with the French iron-clads and torpedo flotilla last year\r\n(1886), ‘In my experience as a sailor I have always found that the\r\nsea is merciful to big ships and hard upon small ones.’ A moderately\r\nrough sea that scarcely troubles the iron-clad or the cruiser of\r\nconsiderable size, suffices to render inevitable a reduction in speed\r\nof the small vessels, and a serious loss of power in the accurate\r\nuse of their torpedoes and guns. As adjuncts to fleets, the small\r\nswift vessels and boats are undoubtedly of immense value under many\r\ncircumstances; for the defence or attack of forts and coasts they\r\nare well fitted, but as substitutes for all other types, and as the\r\nsuccessful rival of large war-ships in sea service, their claim is\r\nnot, and probably will not be, established.\r\n\r\n“The discovery of the minimum size of swift torpedo-vessels or\r\ntorpedo-boat destroyers really capable of independent sea service\r\nwith a fleet is now engaging attention in all navies. In France the\r\nfirst attempts were made in the _Bombe_ class in 1883; some vessels\r\nof this class were tried in the recent manœuvres and favorably\r\nmentioned. In England the _Grasshopper_ class was designated in\r\n1885, and the first completed vessel, the _Rattlesnake_, is now\r\ncompleting her speed trials.” Since this last sentence was written\r\nthe _Rattlesnake_ has made 18.799 knots with a collective indicated\r\nhorse-power of 2718.27, and though the weather was boisterous,\r\nproved that under normal conditions she could furnish a fairly\r\nsteady platform for her battery. Chief Constructor White continues\r\nas follows: “These vessels are of 450 tons, and estimated to steam\r\nabout 19 knots an hour. Messrs. Thomson, of Clydebank, have just\r\ncompleted another example of the class, intermediate in size between\r\nthe _Bombe_ and _Grasshopper_, and said to have attained the very\r\nhigh speed of 22½ knots on trial in smooth water. Experience at sea\r\nwith these vessels will be of immense value to future designs. They\r\ncombine an armament of light guns with torpedo armaments, and can\r\nact either as torpedo-vessels or as destroyers of torpedo craft.\r\nSimilarly in the largest classes of torpedo-boats light guns as well\r\nas torpedoes are provided for. In fact there has been a departure\r\nfrom the original idea of having the torpedo as the only weapon, as\r\nthe boats have increased in size, and this change cannot but commend\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\nThe _Milan_ mentioned in the text was designed in 1879 for a torpedo\r\ndespatch-vessel, but is now used as a scout. She is 303 feet in\r\nlength, 32 feet 10 inches in beam, draws 15 feet 1 inch aft, and\r\nhas a displacement of 1550 tons. She carries a fair battery but no\r\ntorpedoes, is propelled by twin screws, each worked by two compound\r\ntandem engines, and has Belleville boilers. On her trial she made\r\n18.4 knots in a rough sea, and developed with natural draft 4132\r\nhorse-power, or more than was expected with forced draft; she carries\r\nthree hundred tons of coal and has a three-masted schooner rig.\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of torpedo-vessels since her day has resulted\r\nin the evolution of different types suited to different demands,\r\nand of late France has adopted the following classification for her\r\ntorpedo flotilla:\r\n\r\n                                                     Displacement.\r\n  1. Torpedo-cruisers\r\n        (_croiseurs-torpilleurs_)                 1260 to 1280 tons.\r\n  2. Torpedo despatch-boats\r\n        (_avisos-torpilleurs_)                    320 to 360 tons.\r\n  3. Sea-going torpedo-boats\r\n        (_torpilleurs de haute mer_)              50 tons and over.\r\n  4. Coast-guard torpedo-boats\r\n        (_torpilleurs-garde cotes_)          _a_, 25 tons; _b_, 50 tons.\r\n  5. Picket torpedo-boats\r\n        (_torpilleurs-videttes_)                  less than 25 tons.\r\n\r\nThe _Condor_, _Epervier_, _Faucon_, and _Vautour_ are examples of\r\nthe first class, and combine the lightness of hull and the gun\r\narmament of the torpedo-catcher with the sea-going powers of the\r\ncruiser. They are twin-screw steel vessels, 216 feet long, 29\r\nfeet 2 inches in beam, 15 feet 5 inches in draught, and with 3200\r\nindicated horse-power are expected to develop 17 knots. The armament\r\nconsists of five torpedo-tubes, five 4-inch and six machine guns. In\r\nEngland the _Scout_, the prototype of this class, is a twin-screw\r\ntorpedo-cruiser, 220 feet in length, 34 feet 3 inches in beam, and\r\nwith 14 feet draught displaces 1450 tons. Like the _Condor_ she\r\nis subdivided into water-tight compartments and has a steel deck;\r\non her trial she developed with forced draft 17.6 knots and 3350\r\nhorse-power. Her armament consists of eleven torpedo-tubes, four\r\n5-inch rifles on central pivots, and eight Nordenfeldt guns.\r\n\r\nThe _Fearless_ is a sister ship to the _Scout_. So highly was\r\nthe class esteemed that eight others known as the _Archer_ class\r\nwere laid down, and of these the _Cossack_, _Mohawk_, _Porpoise_,\r\n_Tartar_, _Archer_, and _Brisk_ have already undergone satisfactory\r\nsteam trials, while the _Serpent_ and _Raccoon_ are approaching\r\ncompletion. All these vessels have a protective deck extending\r\nthroughout their length, and carry a battery of six 6-inch guns on\r\nsponsons, two at each extremity, and two in the waist. On the final\r\ntrials the _Archer_ developed under forced draft 17.8 knots and 4122\r\nhorse-power, the _Brisk_ 18 knots and 3954 horse-power, the _Cossack_\r\n18 knots and 4003 horse-power, the _Porpoise_ 17.5 knots and 3943\r\nhorse-power, and the _Tartar_ 17.28 knots and 3824 horse-power. They\r\nhave a very low coal consumption, and a coal endurance which was\r\nestimated in the _Archer’s_ case to be sufficient for six days, or\r\n2600 knots at full speed, or for 7000 miles at a 10-knot rate. Both\r\nthe Russians and the Austrians have vessels of this type, and there\r\nis no doubt of the favor with which it is looked upon.\r\n\r\nBesides the _Grasshopper_ class mentioned in the text, and which\r\nincludes the _Rattlesnake_, _Spider_, _Sandfly_, and _Sharpshooter_,\r\nthere are two steel cruising torpedo gun-vessels, the _Curlew_\r\nand _Landrail_, of 785 tons; these are fitted with a protective\r\nsteel deck throughout their length, and have a battery of one\r\n6-inch gun, three 5-inch pivots, a supply of machine guns, and four\r\ntorpedo-tubes. They were intended to develop 14 knots and 1200\r\nhorse-power, but on trial the _Curlew_ attained 15.081 knots and\r\n1452 horse-power. Owing to a faulty design these ships draw with\r\ntheir proposed weights two feet four inches more water than was\r\nexpected. In addition to these ships the English have the composite\r\ngun-vessels _Buzzard_, _Swallow_, _Nymphe_, and _Daphné_ of 1040\r\ntons; the _Icarus_ and _Acorn_, of the _Reindeer_ and _Melita_ type;\r\nthe _Rattler_, _Wasp_, _Bramble_, _Lizard_, _Pigmy_, _Pheasant_,\r\n_Partridge_, _Plover_, _Pigeon_, and _Peacock_, all of 715 tons\r\ndisplacement, with an average speed of 13.5 knots and from 1000 to\r\n1200 horse-power; and the two despatch and scout vessels _Alacrity_\r\nand _Surprise_. The last named displace 1400 tons, and were designed\r\nfor 3000 horse-power and 17 knots. Both exceeded these expectations,\r\nand the _Alacrity_ was lately assigned a battery of four 5-inch\r\nguns on sponsons, four 6-pounder rapid fire, and two five-barrelled\r\nNordenfeldts.\r\n\r\nIt must be stated, however, that, so far torpedo-boats are not as\r\nsuccessful in practice as Admiral Aube would have had the naval world\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\n“Swayed by the concurrent testimony of different officers who\r\nconducted or took part in the naval manœuvres of 1886, professional\r\nopinion appears to agree that torpedo-boats are very delicate\r\ninstruments at best, and that a greater tonnage is imperative where\r\nservice at sea is anticipated. A day or two in even moderate\r\nweather is sufficient to exhaust the stanchest crew on account of\r\nthe excessive balloting about, and a prolonged voyage has been found\r\nto be fatally injurious to the adjustments of the Whitehead for\r\nhorizontal accuracy. Furthermore, in such small, low craft a correct\r\nestimate of the distance, speed, or course of the enemy is most\r\ndifficult, especially if the officer be in the conning-tower, looking\r\nthrough the narrow sight-slits; in anything of a sea-way, also,\r\naccurate pointing is out of the question.... In the course of the\r\npast year Schichau has yielded to Thornycroft the honor of producing\r\nthe fastest vessel in the world, the owner now being the Spanish\r\nAdmiralty in place of the Russian. This boat is the _Ariete_, with a\r\nspeed of 26.18 knots.\r\n\r\n“It has become a question in the minds of some eminent designers and\r\nobservers, notably M. Normand, whether or not the extreme speeds\r\nsought and obtained in some recent boats are not excessive. Damage\r\nto the motive machinery is more to be apprehended than any injury to\r\nthe hull or casualty among the crew. When it is considered that under\r\nordinary conditions of weather and service the speed of the fastest\r\nwill be little greater than that of an ordinary twenty-knot boat,\r\nthe propriety at once suggests itself of devoting to steel plate the\r\nextra weight of boiler, water, and engine necessary to produce that\r\npractically superfluous horse-power.”[30]\r\n\r\nThe trials of this year have not confirmed the great promises made\r\nfor the type by its most able and influential advocates. Many of\r\nthe English boats broke down, and in few cases were the high speeds\r\nrealized in actual sea duty. The truth is, torpedo-boats have been\r\nbrought down to such a condition of refinement to meet the special\r\ncircumstances of their work that it appears probable they have become\r\ntoo delicate for rough handling. Out of twenty-seven boats that were\r\nrequired to steam a distance of one hundred miles, seven failed\r\nto run the course at all, having been, from one cause or another,\r\npractically disabled. Such a heavy percentage of failures—one\r\nresulted in a loss of life—under a trial test to which the boats\r\nmight at any time be subjected, arouses a natural doubt as to a\r\npolicy which is sacrificing for certain impracticable results\r\nconsiderations that are of vital importance.\r\n\r\nSo far as the French naval manœuvres proved this year, the\r\ntorpedo-boats were not equal to the task assigned them. During these\r\nexperiments a squadron of eight armored battle-ships, three cruisers,\r\nand two sea torpedo-boats, under command of Vice-admiral Peyron, was\r\nsupposed to represent a convoy of troop-ships and guard-vessels which\r\nwas to be intercepted on a voyage from Toulon to Algiers by a torpedo\r\ndivision of four cruisers, one store-ship, and sixteen boats, with\r\nthe _Gabriel Charmes_, gun-boat, all lying off Ajaccio, under command\r\nof Rear-admiral Brown de Coulston.\r\n\r\nVice-admiral Peyron and his heavy squadron left port on the day\r\nappointed with a strong northerly gale and a high sea, and shortly\r\nafter clearing the land the _Indomptable_, an armored battle-ship,\r\nsustained some damage and had to anchor under the Hyères Islands.\r\nThe mistral sent the other vessels rapidly on their way to the\r\nAfrican coast without slackening speed, all keeping well together,\r\nwith the two torpedo-boats steaming along under the higher sides\r\nof their consorts. On the other hand, the torpedo division of\r\nRear-admiral Brown, which had left Toulon two days before the\r\nfictitious convoy, was concentrated at Ajaccio. They ran seaward\r\non Saturday night to find the Peyron ships, but the latter had\r\ncleverly given them the go-by in the darkness and bad weather, and\r\nthe mosquito flotilla was forced to return to Corsica for shelter.\r\nAjaccio was reached by Rear-admiral Brown on Sunday afternoon, and\r\nit was not until four-and-twenty hours afterwards that the weather\r\nmoderated sufficiently to enable him to put to sea again, but by that\r\ntime the Algiers convoy had already been at anchor in their port\r\nof destination since the morning. The preliminary operations were\r\ntherefore a pronounced failure.\r\n\r\nThe _Gabriel Charmes_ illustrates a design which is similar to\r\nthat of a torpedo-boat, except that in place of a torpedo tube\r\none 5.5-inch gun is carried forward. The deck is strengthened to\r\nbear this weight, and immediately abaft the piece is an armored\r\nconning-tower, within which the commanding officer is enabled by\r\nan ingenious mechanism to direct the movements of the vessel. The\r\ndimensions are as follows: length 132.6 feet, beam 12.6 feet, draught\r\n6.7 feet, and displacement 74 tons. The engines are two-cylindered\r\ncompound, and developed 560 indicated horse-power and 19 knots. The\r\nboats are said to be very cranky even in smooth water, but so highly\r\nis their fighting power rated that fifty more have been ordered.\r\nIn the Mediterranean manœuvres of May the _Gabriel Charmes_ proved\r\nto be the swiftest vessel of the torpedo squadron, as on the run\r\nfrom Toulon to Ajaccio she led the others by three hours, and was\r\nalways in the advance while scouting. One paddle-wheel armored\r\ndespatch-vessel and seven composite armored transports complete the\r\nrecord of additions made to the French fleet last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN, RUSSIAN, GERMAN, AUSTRIAN, AND TURKISH NAVIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Continental navy next in present interest to that of France\r\nis the Italian, owing to the fact that the Italian government,\r\nalthough largely abstaining from the use of armor, has applied\r\nitself urgently to developments of gun-power and speed in large\r\nwar-ships. The _Duilio_ and _Dandolo_ (illustrated on page 105) were\r\nconsidered in the chapter on the French navy, and their resemblance\r\nto the _Inflexible_ type pointed out. They are nearly as large as\r\nthe _Inflexible_, although differing greatly in proportions and form\r\nfrom her. They appear to me to be more objectionable, from the want\r\nof armored stability, if one may so speak, than even the _Ajax_ and\r\n_Agamemnon_, which are themselves, as we know, more objectionable\r\nthan the _Inflexible_. The cause of this is to be found in the fact\r\nthat in designing the British ships, whatever else they may have lost\r\nsight of, the Admiralty constructors saw that the more you contracted\r\nthe length of the armored citadel, the more necessity there was for\r\ngiving the ship great breadth. The reason of this can be made clear.\r\nThe fractional expression which represents the statical stability\r\nof a ship has in its numerator the quantity _y^3x_, in which _y_\r\nrepresents the half-breadth of the ship at the water-line, and _x_\r\nthe length of the ship. If we regard the stability of the armored\r\ncitadel only, and neglect the unarmored ends, _x_ represents the\r\nlength of that citadel, and _y_ its half-breadth. Now if we take two\r\nrectangular citadels, one, say, 100 feet long and 60 feet broad, the\r\nother the same length, but only 50 feet broad, then the value of _x_\r\nwill be the same for both, but the values of _y^3_ will be 216,000\r\nand 125,000 respectively, the ship 60 feet broad having, _cæteris\r\nparibus_, nearly double the citadel stability of the 50-feet broad\r\nship. On the other hand, if you wish to give the narrower ship the\r\nsame citadel stability as the broader one, it will be necessary to\r\nmake her citadel no less than 172-8/10 feet long. Now the citadel of\r\nthe _Duilio_ is 107 feet in length,[31] and the breadth is 64 feet\r\n9 inches—say 65 feet. The citadel of the _Inflexible_ is 110 feet\r\nlong, and its breadth 75 feet, the figures for the _Ajax_ being 140\r\nfeet and 66 feet. Now presuming the citadels to be rectangular in\r\neach case, we shall have,\r\n\r\n  Inflexible    _y^3x_ = 618,750\r\n  Ajax          _y^3x_ = 453,024\r\n  Duilio        _y^3x_ = 452,075\r\n\r\nFrom which it would appear that the _Duilio_ of 11,000 tons derives\r\nfrom this element of stability only about as much as the _Ajax_ of\r\n8500 tons derives from it, and only about three-fourths of that\r\nwhich the _Inflexible_ of 11,400 had allowed to her. There are other\r\ncircumstances, of course, which enter into the stability of these\r\nships, but nothing which I know of or can imagine to enable the\r\n_Duilio_ to compare much more favorably in this respect with the\r\nother vessels, deficient as they themselves are. All this applies,\r\nof course, solely to the ability of these ships to depend upon their\r\narmored citadels for safety in war: in peace they are all safe enough\r\nas regards stability, because they have their unarmored ends to add\r\nlargely to it, although I should doubt if the _Duilio_ is greatly\r\nover-endowed with stability even with her long unarmored ends intact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “DUILIO.”]\r\n\r\nI now come to a series of ships in which the question of the amount\r\nof their armored stability does not arise, because they have no\r\narmored stability at all. For some reason or other Lloyds, in\r\ntheir _Universal Register_, following bad examples, have arrayed\r\nthe _Italia_ and her successors under the heading of “Sea-going\r\nArmor-clads.” These ships are nothing of the kind, in any reasonable\r\nsense of the word, but are, as ships, wholly unarmored, although\r\ncarrying elevated armored towers, and some armor in other places. Mr.\r\nKing (in his work previously referred to) puts the facts correctly\r\nwhen he says:\r\n\r\n“The armor is only used” (in the form of a curved deck, be it\r\nunderstood) “to keep out shot and shell from the engines and boilers,\r\nthe magazines, shell-room spaces, and the channels leading therefrom\r\nto the upper deck, and to protect the guns in the casemate when not\r\nelevated above the battery, and the gunners employed in firing them.\r\nBut all other parts of the ship above the armored deck” (which is\r\nbelow water, be it said), “all the guns not in the casemate, and all\r\npersons out of the casemate, and not below the armored deck, will be\r\nexposed to the enemy’s projectiles.”\r\n\r\nMr. King takes note of this total abandonment of side armor as\r\na means of preserving stability when a ship is pierced at the\r\nwater-line, and regards this abandonment as a bold defiance of the\r\nprinciples which I have laid down for some years past. I cannot say\r\nthat I take this view of the matter. I have always discussed this\r\nmatter from the British navy point of view, and had these ships of\r\nthe _Italia_ type been built for the British navy in substitution of\r\nreal iron-clads, while France, Russia, and other European countries\r\nwere still building such iron-clads, I should have certainly\r\ncondemned them. The primary requirement of British first-class\r\nships is that they shall be able to close with and fight any enemy\r\nof the period whatever, and any defect which unfits them for this\r\nwork, or makes it extremely dangerous to perform it, is a disgrace\r\nto England. Even if armor were given up by other powers, it would\r\nbe a matter for careful consideration in England whether enough of\r\nit for the protection of their existence against contemporary guns\r\nshould not be retained in her principal ships. England’s ability\r\nto live as a nation and as the head of an empire is dependent upon\r\nher naval superiority, and no price to purchase that can be too\r\ngreat for her to pay. But with Italy the case was and is wholly\r\ndifferent. She could not compete with England in naval power, and\r\nwould not wish to if she could, for she is without an ocean empire\r\nto preserve. But Italy has European neighbors, and when she began\r\nto build these _Italias_ and _Lepantos_ she had for neighbor one\r\npower, France, which had unwisely persisted for years in building\r\nwooden armor-clads, neither strongly protected nor swift, nor very\r\npowerfully armed; and I am not at all sure that, to such a navy as\r\nFrance then had, a few extremely fast and very powerfully armed ships\r\nsuch as Italy built were not excellent answers. The _Italia_ would\r\nhave been available also against a very large proportion of the\r\nBritish iron-clad fleet, and of the fleets of Austria, Turkey, and\r\nRussia. The idea of the Italian ministers clearly was to give weaker\r\nships no time for long engagements with them, but to pounce upon\r\nthem by means of enormous speed, and to destroy them at a blow by\r\nmeans of their all-powerful ordnance. They might well expect to have\r\nwith such ships so great a command over the conditions under which\r\nthey would give battle as to be well able to repair in time, and at\r\nleast temporarily, such dangerous wounds as they might receive. But\r\nmore than this cannot be said for such ships: they are not fit to\r\nengage in prolonged contests, or to fight such actions as by their\r\nassaults on superior numbers and their endurance of close conflict\r\nhave won that “old and just renown” of which England is so deservedly\r\nproud. It seems to me as obvious as anything can possibly be that\r\nsuch ships as the _Italia_, if once adopted as models for other great\r\npowers, would admit of easy and cheap answers. Ships of equal speed,\r\nmerely belted with very thick armor, and armed with an abundance of\r\ncomparatively light shell-guns, would effectually defy them. There\r\nwould be no need of enormous and costly armaments, or of ponderous\r\narmored towers, or of huge revolving turrets, for giving battle to\r\nships which any shells would be able to open up to the inroads of\r\nthe sea, and which, being opened up, would lose their stability,\r\nand insist upon turning bottom upward. But for the purposes of the\r\nItalian government, as I conjecture them, the _Italia_ class of\r\nships, large as they are, have probably been excellent investments,\r\nand may continue to be, so long as the priceless value of impregnable\r\nbelts and interior torpedo defence is understood by so very few.\r\n\r\nThe Italian government, having completed the _Italia_, is now\r\npressing forward with four other equally large ships (of over 13,000\r\ntons each) of similar type, and with three others of 11,000 tons.\r\nCuriously enough, it keeps with these among the “war vessels of\r\nthe first class” not only the _Palestro_ and _Principe Amedeo_, of\r\nabout 6000 tons, launched in 1871-72, but also the _Roma_, a wooden\r\nvessel of 5370 tons, launched twenty years ago, and some four or five\r\niron ships, of 4000 tons and of 12 knots speed, launched more than\r\ntwenty years ago. I will not occupy time and space by regarding the\r\nparticulars of these old vessels (having omitted similar ones from\r\nmy French tables), but will here give the particulars of the modern\r\nvessels of the Italian first class, which alone deserve notice:\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN ITALIAN WAR-SHIPS OF THE FIRST CLASS.\r\n\r\n              Part 1 of 2\r\n  +---------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n  |               |Displace-|Indicated|        |         |          |\r\n  | NAME OF SHIP. |  ment.  | Horse-  | Speed  | Length. | Breadth. |\r\n  |               |         | power.  |        |         |          |\r\n  +---------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n  |               |   Tons. |         | Knots. |  Feet.  | Feet.

In the\r\nfirst place, she has eight steel vessels ranging from 2500 tons to\r\n3600 tons, which Lloyds describe as “deck-protected cruisers,” with\r\na total absence of any justification, I think, excepting that other\r\npeople have doubtless done so before.[33]\r\n\r\nThere certainly are people who for business or other purposes would\r\ncall anything a “protective deck,” but why these eight vessels should\r\nbe removed from the category of unarmored ships, and constitute a\r\nclass by themselves, is more than I can imagine even the slightest\r\nreason or justification for. I do not know any modern naval gun which\r\nwill not penetrate an inch steel plate when presented to it as it\r\nis in the curving down decks of these vessels. It appears to me a\r\ntrifling with serious matters to try and induce naval authorities,\r\nofficers, and seamen to believe that these vessels, and similar\r\nones wherever they are to be found, have any pretensions to be\r\nregarded as “protected.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DECK PLAN OF THE “ITALIA.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “ITALIA.”]\r\n\r\nThese unarmored vessels are, however, notable for high speed, three\r\nof them being of fifteen knots, and the other five of seventeen\r\nknots. One of these 17-knot vessels, the _Giovanni Bausan_, built\r\nby Sir William Armstrong & Co., at Newcastle-on-Tyne, so closely\r\nresembles the Chilian vessel _Esmeralda_ that the engraving of the\r\nlatter vessel on this page may be taken to illustrate the general\r\ncharacter of both. The breadth (42 feet) is the same in each, and so\r\nis the draught of water (18½ feet), but the _Bausan_ is a few feet\r\nlonger than the other. The armament is almost precisely the same,\r\nbeing two guns of about twenty-five tons, mounted one forward and\r\none aft, and six of four tons. I have chosen the _Esmeralda_ for the\r\nillustration of both vessels because (by the favor of Sir William\r\nArmstrong & Co.) I am in possession of an instantaneous photograph\r\nof her at full speed, from which the engraving has been made. This\r\nis very interesting, because it exhibits what few readers are likely\r\nto have seen, but what most will be glad to see, _viz._, the form\r\nwhich is taken by the permanent waves that accompany such a ship when\r\nsteaming at the full speed of seventeen knots in comparatively still\r\nwater. The engraving also well represents the position of the bow and\r\nstern guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “ESMERALDA.”]\r\n\r\nThe 15-knot vessels of Italy are named _Giojà_, _Amerigo Vespucci_,\r\n_Savoia_, and _Colombo_, of which the _Amerigo Vespucci_ is\r\nillustrated from a drawing by De Martino on page 115. Those of\r\nseventeen knots, besides the _Bausan_, are the _Etna_, _Vesuvio_,\r\n_Stromboli_, and _Fieramosca_. All the last-named vessels carry the\r\nsame armament as the _Bausan_; the others an armament of 4-ton guns\r\nonly. The Italian government also possesses (built or building) eight\r\nother vessels exceeding or reaching fifteen knots in speed, of which\r\ntwo are built of wood and the remainder of iron or steel. It has\r\nlikewise of fast torpedo craft a 2000-ton vessel of nineteen knots,\r\nwhich mounts six 6-inch guns and nine 6-pounders; and four others\r\nof twenty knots, to carry machine guns, _viz._, the _Tripoli_ and\r\n_Goito_, of 741 tons, and the _Folgore_ and _Saetta_, of 317 tons. It\r\nis also proposed to build six others, of 741 tons and twenty knots,\r\ntwo of which, the _Monzambano_ and _Montebello_, have been laid down\r\nat Spezzia. They have sixty-two complete first-class torpedo-boats of\r\nover one hundred feet in length, and twenty-one second-class, already\r\nbuilt, of less than one hundred feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “AMERIGO VESPUCCI.”]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing statement that the Italian navy is\r\none of much importance, capable of working great destruction upon an\r\nenemy’s fleet of ordinary ships, able to cope with no inconsiderable\r\nnumber of modern vessels, and such as would enable the Italian\r\npeople and government to speak with a voice that would have to be\r\nattentively heeded by any possible ally or any probable enemy in\r\nthe event of European complications arising, or of a European war\r\nbecoming imminent. This does great credit to successive Italian\r\npolitical administrations.\r\n\r\nOf late the German government has been very active in promoting\r\ncommercial ship-building and ocean enterprise, but it has been very\r\nslack in the development of its imperial navy, and for this reason\r\nthe Russian navy next claims our notice. Russia, with the continent\r\nof Europe interposed between its northern and its southern ports,\r\nis compelled to divide its naval strength into two, concentrating\r\none part upon the Baltic and the other upon the Black Sea; and both\r\nthese divisions of its navy are under restrictions which approach\r\npretty nearly to the conditions of blockades. With winter comes the\r\nnatural blockade of Cronstadt and St. Petersburg on the Baltic,\r\nand this sometimes lasts so long that I have myself seen the first\r\nmerchant-vessel of the year approach Cronstadt on the 29th of May, or\r\nwithin a very few weeks of midsummer. In the South, Sebastopol and\r\nNikolaiev are under the permanent domination of the Bosporus forts\r\nand fleets, and of European treaties, which are stronger still. The\r\ndisasters of the war of 1854 and the political engagements which\r\nensued have also borne heavily upon the naval spirit of Russia,\r\nand it says much for the greatness of that country that again,\r\nin spite of all these hinderances, it is raising its navy into a\r\nposition of European importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CATHERINE II.”]\r\n\r\nConsidering the Black Sea fleet first, the entire interest excited\r\nby its armor-clads centres in the three new 16-knot ships, the\r\n_Catherine II._, _Sinope_, and _Tchesme_. These three ships are\r\nbelted throughout with 18-inch armor, and are armed with six guns\r\nof forty tons and seven of four tons, this battery being fought _en\r\nbarbette_ in towers plated with armor fourteen inches thick. The\r\n_Universal Register_ and the French _Carnet_ agree in assigning to\r\nthe _Catherine II._ a length of 320 feet and a tonnage of 10,000,\r\nand to the other two ships a length of 314 feet and a tonnage of\r\nabout 8600. They also agree in describing the horse-power of each of\r\nthe three ships as 9000 indicated, and the speed as 16 knots. The\r\nAdmiralty Return previously quoted gives them a speed of 15 knots,\r\nand equal tonnages of 10,800 tons.[34] I am unable to give the\r\ntonnage decisively, but I know that the tonnage originally intended\r\nfor these ships was 9990, and I am in possession of the details of\r\nthe corresponding weights. The discrepancies as to steam-power and\r\nspeed are matters of great moment. I believe that both the _Universal\r\nRegister_ and the French _Carnet_ are wrong in associating a power\r\nof only 9000 horses with a speed of sixteen knots, the fifteen knots\r\ngiven by the Admiralty being the speed expected with 9000 indicated\r\nhorse-power; but this power is to be obtained with natural draught,\r\nwhile with forced draught the power is to be increased to 11,400, and\r\nthe speed increased to sixteen knots. The formidable character of\r\nthese ships needs no comment, although I cannot regard them as nearly\r\nequivalent to or as well designed as the somewhat larger _Nile_ and\r\n_Trafalgar_ of the British navy. The only other Black Sea armored\r\nvessels are the slow and small, but somewhat powerful, circular\r\nships _Novgorod_ and _Vice-admiral Popoff_, of which the latter is\r\nsurrounded by 18-inch armor, and carries two guns of forty tons. A\r\ntorpedo-vessel of the 600 ton class, developing 3500 horse-power, and\r\n20 knots speed has been built at Nikolaiev.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic fleet of Russia contains only one finished iron-clad of\r\nmuch importance, the _Peter the Great_, of 9340 tons and 14 knots\r\nspeed, carrying four guns of 40 tons; but two other ships, the\r\n_Emperor Alexander II._ and the _Nicholas I._, of 8400 tons, are now\r\nunder construction at St. Petersburg. No interest attaches to the\r\n_Pojarsky_, the four _Admirals_, and several other old, weak, and\r\nslow armor-clads of the Baltic navy. This fleet comprises, however,\r\neight belted cruisers, of which five are important. These are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+-------+---------+------+--------+------------------+\r\n  |                 |Displa-|Indicated|      |        |    Principal     |\r\n  |  NAME OF SHIP.  |cement.|  Horse- |Speed.| Armor. |    Armament.     |\r\n  |                 |       |  power. |      |        |                  |\r\n  +-----------------+-------+---------+------+--------+------------------+\r\n  |                 |  Tons.|         |Knots.|        |        Guns      |\r\n  |Vladimir Monomach|  5800 |  7000   | 15.4 | 7-inch.|     4 of  9 tons.|\r\n  |Dmitri Donsköi   |  5800 |  7000   | 16.25| 7-inch.| [35]3 ”  29  ”   |\r\n  |Admiral Nachimoff|  7780 |  8000   | 16   |10-inch.|     8 ”   9  ”   |\r\n  |Alexander Nevsky |  7572 |  8000   | 16   |10-inch.|     8 ”   9  ”   |\r\n  |Emperor Nicholas |  8000 |  8000   | 16   |10-inch.|     2 ”  40  ”   |\r\n  +-----------------+-------+---------+------+--------+------------------+\r\n\r\nThe only fast armored cruisers of the Baltic fleet are the _Rynda_\r\nand _Vitias_, of 2950 tons, 3500 horse-power, and 15 knots speed;\r\nand another, the _Admiral Korniloff_, now being completed at Nantes,\r\nto be much larger and faster. Among torpedo-vessels there is the\r\ntwin-screw steel _Iljin_, of 600 tons, which has steamed 20 knots,\r\nand carries 19 machine guns; another, of only 140 tons, but to steam\r\n20 knots, has been built at Glasgow; and a third, of like size, but\r\nof 17 knots, at St. Petersburg. The torpedo-boats of the Russian navy\r\nare given in the Parliamentary Return as below:\r\n\r\n  BALTIC TORPEDO-BOATS.\r\n\r\n  _Completed_: 4 over 100 feet in length; 74 over 70 feet in length;\r\n  20 under 70 feet in length. _Completed and building_: 6 over 100\r\n  feet in length, of which 4 are over 150 feet long—total, 104.\r\n\r\n  BLACK SEA TORPEDO-BOATS.\r\n\r\n  _Completed_: 5 over 100 feet in length; 8 over 70 feet in length; 6\r\n  under 70 feet in length. _Completed and building_: 7 over 100 feet\r\n  in length—total, 26.\r\n\r\nRussia has also a volunteer fleet consisting of ten vessels of no\r\ngreat fighting value; a Siberian flotilla comprising nine gun-boats\r\nand other small craft; a Caspian flotilla of seven small vessels; and\r\nan Aral flotilla of still less moment.\r\n\r\nIn the German armored navy four citadel vessels figure as having\r\nthe heaviest (16-inch) armor, but these are of that objectionable\r\n_Sachsen_ type to which I previously adverted. In order to let the\r\nreader see under what slight pretexts some people are prepared\r\nto regard ships as powerful iron-clads, I give engravings which\r\nrepresent the Sachsen in side view and in plan, these illustrations\r\nbeing taken from _Captain_ J. F. von Kronenfels’s “Das Schwimmende\r\nFlottenmaterial der Seemächte.” The shaded portion in the middle\r\nexhibits the extent of this ship’s armor; the long white ends are\r\nleft to depend upon walls of cork, etc., which are very poor—nay,\r\nalmost imaginary—defences against the effects of explosive shells.\r\n\r\nIn observing the limitation of the armor in this and similar ships\r\none is tempted to ask, Why stop there? Why not shorten the armor, say\r\nto twenty or thirty feet of length, and make it a yard thick, and\r\nthen enter her in the list of iron-clads as a vessel with armor three\r\nfeet thick? Deck-plating, according to such constructors, is ample\r\nfor the protection of engines and boilers, and everything else which\r\nis below water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALF-DECK PLAN OF THE “SACHSEN.”\r\n\r\nSIDE ELEVATION OF THE “SACHSEN.”]\r\n\r\nThe remaining three ships of this class are the _Baiern_, the\r\n_Baden_, and the _Würtemberg_. The engraving of the _Sachsen_\r\nrepresents their general appearance. Their dimensions and other\r\nparticulars will be given presently in table on page 125, but it\r\nwill be observed that the armament is arranged in a forward and in a\r\nmidship battery, giving right-ahead fire with four guns, a stern fire\r\nwith two, and beam fire with three.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “SACHSEN.”]\r\n\r\nThe largest iron-clad of the German navy is the _König Wilhelm_, of\r\n9750 tons, which steams at 14¾ knots. She is also the most thickly\r\narmor-plated (armor, twelve inches); but having been launched\r\neighteen years ago, her guns, although numerous, are only of fourteen\r\ntons weight. I designed this ship for his Majesty, the late Sultan of\r\nTurkey, Abdul-Aziz, but before she was much advanced in construction\r\nshe was purchased by the Prussian government, and passed from under\r\nmy care. A few years later I designed the _Kaiser_ and _Deutschland_\r\nfor the Prussian government; and these vessels, built on the Thames,\r\nand launched in 1874, although 2000 tons smaller than the _Wilhelm_,\r\nsteamed but one-fourth of a knot less (14½ knots). They carry 10-inch\r\narmor and 10-ton guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALF-DECK PLAN OF THE “KAISER.”\r\n\r\nSIDE ELEVATION OF THE “KAISER.”]\r\n\r\nThese ships are described on page 125. The principal ships built\r\nin Germany are the _Preussen_ and the _Friedrich der Grosse_,\r\nwhich, although designed by the German Admiralty constructors,\r\nare but reproductions on a less scale, and with some variations,\r\nof the British turret-ship _Monarch_, designed by myself. Lord\r\nBrassey (in “The British Navy,” vol. i., page 22) says: “In the\r\nmean time Germany had constructed three turret-ships of precisely\r\nthe same type as the _Monarch_, but of somewhat smaller dimensions.\r\nThese were the _Preussen_, the _Friedrich der Grosse_, and the\r\n_Grosser Kurfürst_.”[36] His lordship goes on to say (what I do\r\nnot understand), “Their armor at the water-line is six inches\r\nthicker, while at the turrets it is two inches less, than that of\r\nthe _Monarch_.” Now, as Lord Brassey elsewhere says (page 326), “the\r\n_Monarch_ is protected with 8-inch armor,” and (page 333), writing\r\nof the _Preussen_, “that the armor-plates at the water-line are 9¼\r\ninches thick, below the water 7¼ inches, and above the water 8¼\r\ninches,” it is obvious that there cannot be the difference of six\r\ninches which his first-quoted statement alleges. There doubtless\r\nwas a difference of an inch, or possibly of two inches, in so far\r\nas a few of the armor-plates were concerned, but not more, and how\r\nfar this difference extended is very doubtful, seeing that nowadays\r\nif the constructor of a ship thickens but two or three plates on\r\neach side of his ship he feels entitled to speak of her as being\r\narmored with plates of the maximum thickness, and to mislead mankind\r\naccordingly. Nor is this surprising, when we see in a late return to\r\nthe British Parliament ships like the British _Collingwood_ class,\r\nthe French _Brennus_ class, and the German _Sachsen_ class gravely\r\nincluded in the lists of “armored vessels.”\r\n\r\nThe particulars of the German armored fleet, leaving out the _Hansa_,\r\na weak and weakly armed ship of only 3500 tons and 12 knots speed,\r\nand all smaller armored craft, are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-GOING ARMORED SHIPS OF GERMANY.\r\n\r\n  +----------------+--------+---------+-------+---------+---------------+\r\n  |                | Displa-|Indicated| Speed.| Maximum |   Principal   |\r\n  |  NAME OF SHIP. | cement.|  Horse- |       |  Armor. |   Armament.   |\r\n  |                |        |  power. |       |         |               |\r\n  +----------------+--------+---------+-------+---------+---------------+\r\n  |                |  Tons. |         | Knots.| Inches. |      Guns.    |\r\n  | König Wilhelm  |  9750  |   8300  |  14¾  |   12    | 18 of 14 tons.|\r\n  | Kaiser         |  7550  |   8000  |  14½  |   10    |  8  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Deutschland    |  7550  |   8000  |  14½  |   10    |  8  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Friedrich der  |        |         |       |         |               |\r\n  |   Grosse       |  6600  |   4930  |  14   |    9½   |  4  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Preussen       |  6600  |   4380  |  14   |    9½   |  4  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Baden          |  7280  |   5600  |  14   |   16    |  6  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Baiern         |  7280  |   5600  |  14   |   16    |  6  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Sachsen        |  7280  |   5600  |  14   |   16    |  6  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Würtemberg     |  7280  |   5600  |  14   |   16    |  6  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Oldenburg      |  5200  |   3900  |  13½  |   12    |  8  ” 18  ”   |\r\n  | Friedrich Karl |  6000  |   3500  |  13½  |    5    | 16  ”  9  ”   |\r\n  | Kronprinz      |  5480  |   4800  |  14¼  |    5    | 16  ”  9  ”   |\r\n  +----------------+--------+---------+-------+---------+---------------+\r\n\r\nAll the above German ships are completed, and have been for a long\r\ntime, with the exception of the _Oldenburg_, which was not launched\r\nuntil 1884. The _Baden_ was launched in 1880, the _Baiern_ and\r\n_Würtemberg_ in 1878, and all the rest earlier—the _Friedrich Karl_\r\nand _Kronprinz_ nearly twenty years ago. Germany appears to have\r\nno iron-clad, large or small, under construction at present. It is\r\nunnecessary to set forth in detail her small armored gun-vessels;\r\nsuffice it to say that she has one iron turret-ship, the _Arminius_,\r\nof 1560 tons, with 7½-inch armor, but only carrying four 9-ton\r\nguns, and steaming 10 to 11 knots; and eleven iron vessels of 10\r\nfeet draught of water, 1090 tons displacement, 700 horse-power, 9\r\nknots speed, and 8-inch armor, each carrying one 12-inch gun of 37\r\ntons. These were all built at Bremen, and launched between 1876\r\nand 1880, inclusive. They are named after such agreeable creatures\r\nas basilisks, crocodiles, salamanders, scorpions, etc., but owing\r\nto their small speed would probably prove of less aggressive habits\r\nthan their names imply. They would nevertheless be very useful in\r\ndefending the coasts and harbors.\r\n\r\nThe abstention for the present of the German government from the\r\nconstruction of armored ships must not be taken as implying that it\r\nprefers the fast unarmored cruiser as a type of war-ships, for it has\r\nno such cruiser built, and is building but three of very high speed,\r\nand one of 16 knots.[37] The particulars of these are as follows:\r\n\r\n  +---------------+---------------+--------------+--------+------------+\r\n  | NAME OF SHIP. | Displacement. |  Indicated   | Speed. | Armament.  |\r\n  |               |               | Horse-power. |        |            |\r\n  +---------------+---------------+--------------+--------+------------+\r\n  |               |    Tons.      |              | Knots. |    Guns.   |\r\n  | Elisabeth     |    4500       |    8000      |  18    | 14 8-inch. |\r\n  | Ariadne       |    4800       |    8000      |  18    | 14 8-inch. |\r\n  | Charlotte     |    3360       |    ....      |  16    |    ....    |\r\n  | Loreley       |    2000       |    5400      |  19    |  2 4-inch. |\r\n  +---------------+---------------+--------------+--------+------------+\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty Return makes no mention of the last ship, as she is but\r\na despatch-vessel, but she is mentioned and particularized in the\r\n_Universal Register_. It is to be further observed that the first\r\ntwo vessels on this list are each to have a 3-inch deck, for the\r\nprotection of the engines, boilers, etc., which fact has induced the\r\nAdmiralty officers to designate them “protected ships,” as they do\r\ntheir own ships of this really unprotected type, and as they have not\r\ndesignated the French cruisers _Tage_ and _Cécile_.\r\n\r\nThe German navy comprises a few modern and fast frigates, some of\r\nwhich have been honored with illustrious names, as will be seen from\r\nthe following list:\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN UNARMORED FRIGATES.\r\n\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------------+--------+-----------------+\r\n  | NAME OF SHIP.  | Displa-|  Indicated   | Speed. |    Principal    |\r\n  |                | cement.| Horse-power. |        |    Armament.    |\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------------+--------+-----------------+\r\n  |                |  Tons. |              | Knots. |       Guns.     |\r\n  | Bismarck       |  2850  |    2500      |  13½   |  16 of 3½ tons. |\r\n  | Moltke         |  2850  |    2500      |  13½   |  16  ” 3½   ”   |\r\n  | Stosch         |  2800  |    2500      |  13½   |  16  ” 3½   ”   |\r\n  | Stein          |  2800  |    2500      |  13½   |  16  ” 3½   ”   |\r\n  | Prinz Adalbert |  3860  |    4800      |  15    | { 2  ” 6    ”   |\r\n  |                |        |              |        | {10  ” 3½   ”   |\r\n  | Leipzig        |  3860  |    4800      |  15    |  10  ” 3½   ”   |\r\n  | Charlotte      |  3310  |    3000      |  15    |  18  ” 4    ”   |\r\n  | Gueisenau      |  2810  |    3000      |  15    |  16  ” 3½   ”   |\r\n  +----------------+--------+--------------+--------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nThere are also some modern corvettes in this navy which may be\r\nclassed in point of speed with the above frigates; these are,\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN UNARMORED CORVETTES.\r\n\r\n  +---------------+---------+--------------+---------+---------------+\r\n  | NAME OF SHIP. | Displa- |  Indicated   |  Speed. |   Principal   |\r\n  |               | cement. | Horse-power. |         |   Armament.   |\r\n  +---------------+---------+--------------+---------+---------------+\r\n  |               |   Tons. |              |  Knots. |     Guns.     |\r\n  | Alexandrine   |   2330  |     2400     |[38]15   | 10 of 4 tons. |\r\n  | Arcona        |   2330  |     2400     |    15   | 10  ” 4   ”   |\r\n  | Carola        |   2160  |     2100     |    14   | 10  ” 4   ”   |\r\n  | Marie         |   2160  |     2100     |   13½   | 10  ” 4   ”   |\r\n  | Olga          |   2160  |     2100     |    14   | 10  ” 4   ”   |\r\n  | Sophie        |   2160  |     2100     |    14   | 10  ” 4   ”   |\r\n  | Freya         |   2000  |     2500     |    15   |  8  ” 4   ”   |\r\n  +---------------+---------+--------------+---------+---------------+\r\n\r\nThere are about a dozen other smaller and slower gun-vessels and\r\ngun-boats in the German navy, but they need not be considered here.\r\nAs to sea-going torpedo-vessels, the German government took the\r\nlead in the production of this type of ship, and had the _Ziethen_\r\nlaunched at Blackwall as a despatch-vessel ten years ago, for a\r\ntorpedo armament, and with a speed of 16 knots—an example of naval\r\nenterprise worth remembering to the credit of Germany. The _Bletz_\r\nand _Pfeil_, of 50 per cent. larger tonnage, have since been produced\r\nin Germany, but only with a speed about equal to the _Ziethen’s_. Two\r\ntorpedo gun-vessels of 855 tons and nearly 2000 horse-power, and 15\r\nknots speed (of which vessels the Admiralty Return makes no mention),\r\nwere launched at Bremen in 1884. The following is the Admiralty\r\nstatement as to German torpedo “boats:” _Completed_, 58 (43 over 100\r\nfeet in length). _Completing and building_, 2 torpedo division boats;\r\n30 torpedo-boats over one hundred feet in length.—Total, 90.\r\n\r\nMoney was voted in 1884-85 for seventy torpedo-boats. When these have\r\nbeen built, the number of German torpedo-boats will be one hundred\r\nand five, and these are to be increased to one hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nReviewing the condition of the German navy as set forth above, it\r\nbecomes obvious that for some years past the policy of the imperial\r\nGerman government (contrary to that of the Prussian government,\r\nwhich, before the empire, built several large and powerful sea-going\r\nships) has been to avoid all competition in naval matters with\r\nthe great naval powers, and to apply its moderate expenditure to\r\nvessels of a defensive class, such as armored gun-boats and coast\r\ntorpedo-boats—a policy which, in view of the limited interests of\r\nGermany in the Mediterranean and across the seas, has much to commend\r\nit.[39]\r\n\r\nThe Austrian government also, which with less necessity for naval\r\nstrength now than it had when it possessed Lombardy and Venice, has\r\nslackened greatly in the production of iron-clads of late years, and\r\nhas but two, and these of very moderate size, under completion. These\r\nare the barbette-battery ships _Kronprinz Rudolph_, of 6900 tons, and\r\nthe _Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stefanie_, of 5150 tons. The former\r\nvessel is to carry 12-inch armor, and to be armed principally with\r\nthree 48-ton guns; and the latter to carry 9-inch armor, and to be\r\narmed with two such guns. There is much uncertainty about even the\r\nintended speed of these vessels, neither the French _Carnet_ nor the\r\n_Universal Register_ stating the speed, while the Admiralty assigns\r\na speed of 14 knots to the _Rudolph_ only. But while the _Carnet_\r\ngives the indicated horse-power of each as 6500, the _Register_ gives\r\nthat of the _Rudolph_ as 8000, and that of the smaller vessel as much\r\nas 11,000. If these latter figures be correct, the _Rudolph_ will\r\nexceed 14 knots and the _Ferdinand_ 16.[40] Austria already possesses\r\ntwo powerful iron-clads in the _Custoza_ and the _Tegetthoff_, but\r\nher _Kaiser_, _Lissa_, _Ferdinand Max_, and _Hapsburg_ are old\r\nwooden vessels, lightly armored and armed, and need not be further\r\nconsidered. Besides the iron-clads already named, she has likewise\r\nthe three iron central-battery and belted ships _Don Juan d’Austria_,\r\n_Kaiser Max_, and _Prinz Eugen_, each of 3500 tons, 2700 indicated\r\nhorse-power, and 13½ knots speed, with 8-inch armor (the thickest)\r\non the belt, and each carrying eight guns of 9 tons. The unarmored\r\nvessels of Austria (other than those classed as torpedo craft) are\r\nnumerous, but most of them are small and slow. Those of thirteen\r\nknots and upward are but three in number, the _Laudon_, _Radetzky_,\r\nfrigates of 3380 tons and 14 knots speed, and the wooden gun-vessel\r\n_Hum_, of 890 tons and 13¼ knots speed. Austria is providing herself\r\nwith several of Sir W. Armstrong & Co.’s light steel vessels of\r\neighteen knots speed for torpedo service, of which she has one, the\r\n_Panther_, completed, and two others, the _Leopard_ and _Seehund_\r\n(all of 1550 tons), under construction. She had also four 14-knot\r\ntorpedo-vessels, built at Pola and Trieste. Of torpedo “boats” she\r\nhas the following: _Completed_, First class, 135 feet in length, 2;\r\nsecond class, over 100 feet in length, 18; third class, from 85 to 90\r\nfeet in length, 8. _Incompleted_, First class, 135 feet in length, 2;\r\nsecond class, over 100 feet in length, 8.—Total, 38.[41]\r\n\r\nThe navy of Turkey, which was formidable a few years ago, possessing\r\nas it did some of the most powerful and efficient iron-clads in the\r\nworld at that period, both large and small, is rapidly declining\r\nin importance in presence of the powerful ships constructed or\r\nconstructing in England, France, Russia (Black Sea), and Italy. The\r\nTurkish navy would not have held its high position so long had it\r\nnot been for the foresight of the late Sultan Abdul-Aziz, having all\r\nhis armored ships built of iron. There is not a wood-built iron-clad\r\nin the Turkish navy. The largest Turkish armored ship, and one still\r\nvery powerful, is the frigate _Mesoodiyeh_, of 9000 tons, built at\r\nBlackwall, which in her main features resembles the German _König\r\nWilhelm_, being, like her, of English design, but instead of having\r\neighteen main-deck guns of fourteen tons, she has twelve of eighteen\r\ntons, and her battery is consequently of less length. Her speed is\r\nfourteen knots. Next to her comes the _Hemidiyeh_, launched in 1885\r\nat Constantinople, of similar type to the other vessel, but of only\r\n6700 tons, and therefore carrying but 9-inch armor, and ten guns of\r\nfourteen tons, and steaming at a knot less speed. Turkey has no less\r\nthan thirteen other iron-clads, ranging in tonnage from 2000 to over\r\n6000, in speed from 11 to 14 knots, and in armor from 5½ to 9 inches.\r\nThe most notable of these, if I may be allowed as its designer to say\r\nso,[42] has been the _Feth-i-Bulend_ (“Great Causer of Conquest”),\r\nbuilt at the Thames Iron-works in 1869. This little vessel, although\r\nof only 2700 tons displacement, carried a 9-inch armor-belt, and a\r\nmain-deck battery of 6-inch armor protecting four 12-ton guns, placed\r\nat the four oblique sides of an octagonal battery, and steamed at\r\nfourteen knots—a speed unexampled at that time for an iron-clad\r\nof her small tonnage. It is a well-known fact that whenever of\r\nlate years Turkey has had naval work to do, the _Feth-i-Bulend_,\r\non account of her speed, handiness, and general efficiency, was\r\nselected by the late lamented Hobart Pasha to perform its most active\r\npart.\r\n\r\nOf unarmored vessels Turkey has few worth mentioning as fighting\r\nships, beyond three composite corvettes now under construction at\r\nConstantinople, one of 1960 and one of 1160 tons, both of which are\r\nto steam at fourteen knots, their armament consisting of eight and\r\nsix light guns respectively; and one other of 670 tons which is to\r\nsteam fifteen knots[43] and to carry five light and four machine\r\nguns. A steel torpedo-vessel which is to steam at twenty-one knots,\r\nand three torpedo cruisers complete the list of new vessels laid\r\ndown. Turkey has six torpedo “boats” one hundred feet long, built in\r\nFrance; six more of larger size, one hundred and twenty-five feet\r\nlong, building in Germany; and five of one hundred feet, building in\r\nTurkey and France—in all, seventeen torpedo-boats.\r\n\r\nThis review of Turkish naval force bears out the remark with which\r\nI introduced it, and shows that, either from lack of support from\r\nthe Western European powers or from some other cause, fighting\r\nsuperiority in the Black Sea is being effectually abandoned by Turkey\r\nto Russia.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lord Charles Beresford, R.N., M.P. (now a sea lord of the\r\nAdmiralty), who moved for the Admiralty Return to Parliament to which\r\nI have made repeated reference, included Greece among the powers\r\nwhose “fleets” were to be reported on; but as Greece has but two\r\nsmall and weak iron-clads, and they are nearly twenty years old,\r\nand as she has no other at present even under construction, the\r\npretensions of her “fleet” are scarcely proportional to her political\r\nambitions. She has but one fast cruiser, the _Admiral Miaulis_,\r\nand she is only a 15-knot vessel, and carries nothing more in the\r\nway of guns than three of six tons and one of five tons. Greece’s\r\nonly “torpedo-vessel” steams no more than fourteen knots, and the\r\nAdmiralty Return assures Lord Charles Beresford and the world that\r\nshe has but twenty-seven torpedo-boats, of which seventeen are\r\nover and ten under one hundred feet in length, and that she is not\r\nbuilding any more. Considering the island interests of Greece and her\r\nsituation in the Mediterranean, no one can pronounce her naval force\r\nas excessive, or regard her government as being tempted to any high\r\nheroic policy by her possession of an imposing navy.\r\n\r\nI have not mentioned the Spanish or Portuguese “fleets,” nor is it\r\nnecessary to do much more than mention them now. Spain has only one\r\nfinished iron-clad, of over thirteen and less than fourteen knots\r\nspeed, and that is the _Vitoria_, which was launched at Blackwall, on\r\nthe Thames, more than twenty years ago. She has thin armor, and could\r\nattempt but little in war. Spain is, however, building a large steel\r\nturret-ship, the _Pelayo_, of 9650 tons, at La Seyne, to carry two\r\n38-ton and two 48-ton guns, with 18-inch armor on a citadel and 19½\r\non her turrets. She is to steam at sixteen knots. This one ship will,\r\nI presume, when finished, compose the armored “fleet” of Spain—that\r\ncountry once so great upon the sea. Of unarmored vessels of war Spain\r\nis building several, of which three are to have the advantage of\r\nstout steel decks, and one is to be very fast. It will be well to\r\nassemble these unarmored vessels of fourteen knots and upward in a\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE G.—UNARMORED WAR-VESSELS OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\nVESSELS OF FOURTEEN KNOTS AND UPWARD, INCLUDING TORPEDO-VESSELS.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+--------+---------+--------+-----------------+\r\n  |                      | Displa-|Indicated|        |     Principal   |\r\n  |     NAME OF SHIP.    | cement.|  Horse- | Speed. |     Armament.   |\r\n  |                      |        |  power. |        |     Armament.   |\r\n  +----------------------+--------+---------+--------+-----------------+\r\n  |                      |  Tons. |         | Knots. |      Guns.      |\r\n  | Reina Regente        |  4300  | 11,000  |   19   |  4 of 8 inches. |\r\n  | Alfonso XII          |  3000  |  4,400  |   14   |  8  ” 6 tons.   |\r\n  | Aragon (wood)        |  3300  |  4,400  |   14   | {4  ” 6  ”      |\r\n  |                      |        |         |        | {4  ” 3  ”      |\r\n  | Castilla  ”          |  3300  |  4,400  |   14   |  8  ” 4  ”      |\r\n  | Navarra   ”          |  3300  |  4,400  |   14   | {4  ” 6  ”      |\r\n  |                      |        |         |        | {4  ” 3  ”      |\r\n  | Reina Cristina       |  3000  |  4,400  |   14   |  8  ” 6  ”      |\r\n  | Reina Mercedes       |  3000  |  4,400  |   14   |  8  ” 6  ”      |\r\n  | Cristabel Colón      |  1100  |  1,600  |   14   |  3  ” 4  ”      |\r\n  | Don Antonio Ulioa    |  1100  |  1,600  |   14   |  3  ” 4  ”      |\r\n  | Don Juan d’Austria   |  1100  |  1,500  |   14   |  5  ” 4¾ inches.|\r\n  | Infanta Isabel       |  1100  |  1,500  |   14   |  5  ” 4¾   ”    |\r\n  | Isabel II            |  1100  |  1,600  |   14   |  5  ” 4¾   ”    |\r\n  | Velasco              |  1100  |  1,600  |   14.3 |  3  ” 4  tons.  |\r\n  | Isla de Cuba         |  1000  |  2,200  |   15   |  6  ” 4¾ inches.|\r\n  | Islas Filipinas      |  1000  |  2,200  |   15   |  6  ” 4¾   ”    |\r\n  | Destructor           |        |         |        |                 |\r\n  |    (torpedo-catcher) |   400  |  4,000  |   24   |  Machine guns.  |\r\n  | Alcon (sea-going     |        |         |        |                 |\r\n  |     torpedo-boat)    |   108  |  1,200  |   23   |     ”     ”     |\r\n  | Azor   ”    ”        |   108  |  1,200  |   23   |     ”     ”     |\r\n  | Orion  ”    ”        |    88  |  1,000  |   20   |     ”     ”     |\r\n  +----------------------+--------+---------+--------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nSpain has likewise four 125-feet torpedo “boats” of 19 knots; one,\r\n105 feet long, of 18 knots; and three or four smaller ones.[44]\r\n\r\nPortugal has but one iron-clad, central-battery type, of 2480 tons,\r\n13½ knots speed, with 9-inch armor, and two 28-ton guns.

The\r\nimpressions which it has made upon my own mind are mainly these:\r\nThe minor naval powers are falling more or less completely out of\r\nthe lists of naval competition. Spain and Portugal have ceased to\r\nbe, and Greece has not become, of any naval importance—Spain alone\r\nmaking some small effort to keep respectable, but even that effort is\r\nchiefly expending itself—as that of the United States government is\r\nabout to expend itself, by-the-bye—in the production of very fast\r\nvessels, which may be useful in preying upon commerce, but which\r\nare scarcely fit to fight even pirates, and which a real war-ship\r\nwould dispose of with a single round of her battery fire. They will\r\nbe efficient in running away, no doubt, when danger arises; but\r\n“running away” was not the method by which the United States won\r\nnaval distinction, nor that by which Spain once became great and\r\nGreece immortal. The naval policy of Germany is defensive; she is\r\nalmost without pretensions upon the open sea. Turkey is slowly but\r\nsurely succumbing to Russia, and in the near future the Russian Black\r\nSea fleet will hold unquestioned mastery over Turkey. Italy has a\r\nnaval rôle of her own to play in Europe, and on the whole is playing\r\nit well. Austria would do well to hesitate in her present naval\r\ncondition before again exposing herself to the swift and destructive\r\nonslaughts which the tremendously armed and excessively fast Italian\r\nships could make upon her. France is a really great naval power, and\r\nthere are circumstances which would make a naval conflict between her\r\nand England one of the most uncertain in the history of the world.\r\nThe French have very largely abandoned the protection of their guns\r\nby armor; we, most unhappily, have still more largely abandoned\r\nthe protection of our ships, and it remains to be seen which has\r\nbeen the most foolish. In such a conflict the French would have\r\nthis advantage over England—the overthrow of their guns, or the\r\ndestruction of their gunners at them, would not prevent their ships\r\nthemselves from withdrawing from action and repairing their injuries.\r\nWhat would become of our _Ajaxes_, _Agamemnons_, our _Collingwoods_\r\nand _Benbows_ (both these latter with guns as much exposed as the\r\nFrench, by-the-bye), when their long, fragile ends had been smashed\r\nand water-logged, and their high speed consequently gone, is a\r\nquestion which I prefer not to speak of further. There was, there is,\r\nthere ever will be, but one sound policy for a nation that desires to\r\ncommand the seas, and can afford to do so, and that is to reject all\r\ndoubtful fads, all dangerous fancies, and to insure without ceasing\r\npronounced superiority _in every known and measurable element of\r\nnaval power_. New inventions will and must be made; new sources of\r\npower, new means of attack, will and must be discovered; but these\r\nthings take time and money and skill to develop, and that power is\r\nthe greatest and safest which from time to time and always prefers\r\nthe thing which must succeed to that which may, and which others fear\r\nwill, fail in the hour of trial. One hope I, the present writer,\r\nhave, and it is that the terrible development of the weapons of\r\nwar—for terrible it is with all its shortcomings—and the enormously\r\nincreasing cost alike of single actions and of conflicts between\r\nsquadrons and fleets, will tend to further, and to greatly further,\r\nthose influences which are happily operating in favor of peace and\r\ngood-will among men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic development of the Italian navy has been the\r\nabandonment of side-armor as a protection to stability, and the\r\nattempt to obtain high speed and great coal endurance. This bold\r\ndeparture in the matter of armor is due mainly to the fact that\r\nItaly’s sea policy is governed by conditions which appeal nowhere\r\nelse with equal force. “It is the combination of a large army and a\r\npowerful fleet,” writes Sir Charles Dilke, “which really makes Italy\r\nformidable; for if Italy has only the fifth army it has the third\r\nnavy of all the powers. Captain à Court has admirably pointed out\r\nhow, for a young country, and a country with an overburdened budget,\r\nit was not possible to build ship for ship against France, and not\r\nwithin Italy’s power to create a fleet numerically equal to that of\r\nFrance, but that it was possible to build a small number of enormous\r\nsea-going iron-clads of the first class, ‘larger, stronger, swifter,\r\nand more heavily armed than any afloat.’ Were Italy not protected\r\nby a powerful fleet, such as might have some chance of holding its\r\nown against the French in its own waters, the French fleet could be\r\nused to destroy Italian mobilization if Italy had joined an alliance\r\nagainst France. The Italian railway lines could be cut at many places\r\nfrom the coast. Not only from Toulon and Ajaccio, but also from her\r\nnew port at Biserta, on the Tunisian coast, France could keep watch\r\nand could pounce on Italy.\r\n\r\n“The great difficulty, however, in the way of Italy is caused by\r\nher want of coal, for Italy may be said to have no coal for her\r\nships, and the difficulty of getting coal to her southern ports in\r\ntime of war would be immense if she had not command of the seas. In\r\nmaterially increasing the number of her large iron-clads Italy has\r\nbeen aiming at nothing less than the command of the Mediterranean\r\nas against France; but supposing that France were sufficiently free\r\nfrom the risk of maritime attack elsewhere to be able to concentrate\r\nher naval strength in the Mediterranean, it would be a delusion to\r\nsuppose that the Italian naval forces could hold their own against\r\nthe French. The Italian material is excellent, no doubt, but the\r\nresults of Lissa are not encouraging.\r\n\r\n“To judge from naval expenditure, Italy seems to get a great deal\r\nfor her money. If we were to look at the figures we should suppose\r\nthat there were five navies in the world worth counting—the British\r\nand French of the first class, and the Russian, German, and Italian\r\nof the second class; but as a matter of fact the Russian and German\r\nnavies are not worth counting by the side of the Italian navy of\r\nto-day. I doubt, however, whether the Italian, German, and Austrian\r\nnavies could possibly hope to hold the Mediterranean against those\r\nof France and Russia, weak as is the Russian navy, in a general\r\nContinental war, so high is the estimate which I form of the power of\r\nFrance at sea. Russia, indeed, spends more upon her navy than does\r\nItaly; but Russia probably does not get her money’s worth. Italy at\r\nthe present moment, in addition to the two splendid ships which she\r\nhas at sea, is building or equipping eight first-class sea-going\r\niron-clads as against seven being built by France and eleven by\r\nourselves, and she certainly seems to have, as regards the material\r\nof her fleet, achieved remarkable results at a low rate of cost.\r\n\r\n“The Italian fleet, in the event of war, would not have those\r\nscattered duties to perform which would fall to the lot of the\r\nFrench and English navies. The fleet of Italy would have to defend\r\nthe Italian coast against attack, and if possible to keep up the\r\ncommunications with Sicily and Sardinia. Massowah would have to take\r\ncare of itself, and the Italian fleet would be concentrated, while\r\nthat of France, in some degree, would have to be dispersed over the\r\nwhole world; but unless France had to put forth on land such efforts\r\nas to need the men and guns of her navy for the defence of her own\r\nfortresses, the time of concentration in the Mediterranean would\r\narrive, and a great strain would be imposed upon the Italian fleet.\r\n\r\n“Those who look upon the Italian navy as being a navy of offence\r\nbecause it consists chiefly of iron-clads of the first class capable\r\nof holding the seas, forget the necessity imposed upon Italy by her\r\nshape and geographical position. It is impossible to defend the coast\r\nof Italy by fortifications, and there is no country so vulnerable.\r\nThe mountains run down the centre of a long, narrow strip, and the\r\nstrategic railway lines are easily reachable from the sea. On the\r\nsouth, too, Carthage once more threatens Rome. The Italian monster\r\niron-clads are certainly not too numerous for the defence of the\r\nItalian coast, and in my belief the naval policy which has been\r\npursued by Italy is one which was necessary to her existence, and\r\nshe is to be congratulated upon the low price at which she has\r\nsucceeded in obtaining her splendid ships.”[45]\r\n\r\nOwing to this extent and character of the Italian coast, the\r\ngovernment believes that absolute safety cannot be secured, and\r\nall that may be expected is the disturbance or defeat of any great\r\nattempt at invasion or bombardment. This the officials hope to effect\r\nby dividing the attention of the enemy’s fleet, so that secondary\r\nmeans of defence may be utilized against all attacks. The question,\r\ntherefore, resolves into one of ships. If armored vessels had to\r\nresist the gun alone, effectual protection, they reason, could be\r\ngiven by increasing the thickness of armor; but since the invention\r\nof torpedoes, and the development of great speed in torpedo-boats,\r\nthe bottoms of ships and not the armored sides will be the points of\r\nsuccessful attack. The best vessels for their needs, therefore, will\r\nbe such as are capable of making the greatest impression on any given\r\npoint; that is, such as may be enabled by the partial abandonment\r\nof armor to carry enormously heavy guns, and have great speed, the\r\nhighest coal endurance, and sufficient protection, by new structural\r\ndevices, to meet without fear any other vessel afloat.\r\n\r\nThe first fruits of this policy were seen in the central-citadel\r\nbattle-ships, _Duilio_ and _Dandolo_. Apart from their novelty, the\r\nmere fact that the Italians could produce such machines with home\r\nresources was a surprise to the rest of Europe. “The rise of iron\r\nship-building in Italy,” says the _London Engineer_, “is almost a\r\nromance. It owes its origin to the far-seeing efforts of Italy’s\r\ngreatest statesman, Cavour.... Ten years ago it would have seemed\r\nludicrous to the builders on the Clyde had they been told that a\r\ncountry which had no coal worth speaking of, and whose iron, though\r\nabundant, was difficult to get at, and where, moreover, not half a\r\ndozen men knew how to do the simplest iron ship-building job, would\r\nin the course of those years not only beat them in quality but in\r\nprice, and would be turning out the largest, the most powerful, and\r\nthe best built vessels in the world. Such, however, is the case.”\r\n\r\nSubsequently the Italian Admiralty realized that the ships of the\r\n_Duilio_ design were deficient in speed and coal endurance, and that\r\ntheir construction forbade the efficient use of a secondary armament\r\nfor defence against torpedo and other auxiliary boats. So, after much\r\nearnest study, the _Italia_ type has been adopted. The account in\r\nthe text needs no amplification here, except to state that in her\r\nsteam trials she made a maximum speed of 18 and a mean speed of 17.66\r\nknots per hour, although the 18,000 indicated horse-power required by\r\nthe contract was not developed. Eight of her 6-inch guns, it may be\r\nadded, have lately been removed.\r\n\r\nThe _Re Umberto_ and _Sicilia_ are steel barbette ships, similar to\r\nthe British _Admiral_ class without the partial armor-belt. Their\r\nprincipal dimensions are, length 400 feet, beam 74 feet 9 inches,\r\nmean draught 28 feet 7 inches, and displacement 13,251 tons. The\r\nengines of the former are to develop 19,500 horse-power and 17 knots.\r\nA complete steel deck three and a half inches thick protects the\r\nunder-water body. The battery is to consist of four 17-inch 106-ton\r\npair-mounted guns, carried on the fore-and-aft line in two barbettes,\r\nwhich are protected by 18.9 inches of steel armor. There are in\r\naddition a number of 6-inch breech-loading rifles, and a supply of\r\nrapid-fire and machine guns, and of torpedo-tubes. The _Sardegna_, of\r\nthe same general type as the _Umberto_, is now being built at Spezzia.\r\n\r\nThe _Giovanni Bausan_, built at Elswick between 1882 and 1885, is\r\na ram-bowed, schooner-rigged steel cruiser, similar to, but larger\r\nthan, the _Esmeralda_, her dimensions being, length 280 feet, breadth\r\n42 feet, draught 18½ feet, and displacement about 3100 tons. She has\r\nan under-water protective steel deck one and a half inches thick,\r\nand cork-filled cellular compartments about the water-line. The coal\r\nsupply is 600 tons, the coal endurance 5000 miles at 10 knots, and\r\nwith 6000 horse-power and 116 revolutions she made on trial a speed\r\nof 17.5 knots. Her battery consists of two 10-inch, six 6-inch,\r\nand a secondary armament of rapid-fire and machine guns, and of\r\ntorpedo-tubes.\r\n\r\nThe steel cruisers mentioned in the chapter, the _Etna_, _Stromboli_,\r\nand _Vesuvio_, are 283 feet 6 inches in length, 43 feet in beam,\r\n19 feet 3 inches in draught, and displace 3530 tons; with forced\r\ndraft 7700 indicated horse-power and 19 knots are to be developed.\r\nTheir armament is to consist of two 10-inch (25-ton) Armstrong\r\nbreech-loaders, mounted in an unarmored barbette on the fore\r\nand aft line, six 6-inch guns on sponsons, eight rapid-fire and\r\nmachine guns, and four torpedo-tubes—two submerged at the bow and\r\ntwo above water in broadside. The _Fieramosca_ of the same class\r\nis slightly different in dimensions, and the _Tripoli_, _Goito_,\r\n_Monzambano_, and _Montebello_ are rapid torpedo-cruisers, 229 feet\r\n6 inches in length, 25 feet 10 inches in beam, 9 feet 6 inches in\r\nmean draught, and of 741 tons displacement. They were designed to\r\ndevelop 4200 indicated horse-power and a speed of 22 knots; but it\r\nis claimed that the _Tripoli_, which was launched at Castellamare\r\nin August, 1886, realized a speed of twenty-four knots, and\r\nmaintained a twenty-three knot rate for fifty miles. The engines\r\nof the _Monzambano_ and _Montebello_ will be triple-expansion, and\r\nthose of the _Tripoli_ and _Goito_ of the two-cylinder compound\r\ninclined type. These vessels have three screws, one shaft coming out\r\nunderneath the keel at an angle of eight degrees, while the others\r\nare carried farther forward on either side. The armament consists\r\nof four 57-millimetre and four 37-millimetre rapid-fire guns, of\r\nthree 37-millimetre revolving cannons, and of five torpedo-tubes,\r\ntwo at the bow, fixed, and three training—one aft and one on each\r\nbeam. The _Confienza_, a small twin-screw cruiser of nearly the same\r\ndimensions, carries four 4.72-inch guns, together with rapid-fire\r\nand machine guns, and five torpedo-tubes. She is to develop 17.5\r\nknots and 2800 horse-power, and, like the _Tripoli_ class in\r\ngeneral, has very light steel frames and plating, and resembles\r\noutwardly an enlarged torpedo-boat. The _Folgore_ and _Saetta_ are\r\ntorpedo-vessels, similar in type to the _Tripoli_, but smaller; the\r\n_Archimede_ and the _Galileo_ are armed despatch-vessels of the\r\n_Barbarigo_ type; and the _Volturno_ and _Curtatone_ are cruising\r\ngun-vessels. Other notable additions to the fleet are the partially\r\nprotected steel cruiser _Angelo Emo_, of 2100 tons, the _Dogali_, and\r\nthe National Line steamer _America_. The _Angelo Emo_ was designed\r\nby Mr. White, and built at Elswick for the Greek government, but\r\nsubsequently she was bought by the Italians, and has, under her new\r\nname, made a capital record. The _Dogali_ is a twin-screw, lightly\r\nprotected steel cruiser, built at Elswick. The displacement is 2000\r\ntons, length 250 feet, and beam 37 feet; on the first trial the\r\ntriple-expansion engines developed 8100 horse-power and a speed of\r\n18.5 knots, and later, with 7600 horse-power and 154 revolutions, a\r\nspeed of 19.66 knots was attained. The armament is to consist of six\r\n5-inch guns mounted on sponsons—two on the forecastle, two on the\r\npoop, and two in the waist.\r\n\r\nThe _America_ is 441 feet 8 inches in length over all, 51 feet\r\n3 inches in beam, 38 feet 5 inches in depth, draws 26 feet aft,\r\ndisplaces 6500 tons, has a coal capacity of 1550 tons, and develops\r\n9000 horse-power and a maximum speed of 17 knots on a consumption\r\nof 216 tons of coal per day. She is built of steel, was launched\r\nin 1884, purchased in January, 1887, and when refitted is to do\r\nduty as a torpedo-depot and transport-vessel. Two iron cruising\r\ngun-vessels, the _Miseno_ and _Palinuro_, of 548 tons displacement,\r\n430 horse-power, and 10 knots speed, have lately been added to the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nRussia has shown a marked independence in policy and design. Penned\r\nin the Black Sea by treaties, and blockaded in the Baltic for nearly\r\nhalf the year by ice, she has sought in coast-defence vessels, fast\r\ncommerce-destroyers and torpedo-vessels, the fleet best suited\r\nto her necessities. In 1864 a number of monitors, built mainly\r\nupon Ericsson’s system, were launched, and later four vessels,\r\nsea-going, ten-knot turret-ships, were constructed. These are known\r\nas the _Admiral_ class, and range in displacement from 3754 in the\r\n_Lazareff_ to 3693 in the _Tchitchachoff_. About 1871 a radical\r\ndeparture was made by the adoption for the Crimean defence of the\r\n_circular_ or _Popoffka_ type. As the shallow waters of this coast\r\nforbade the employment of anything normal in design except light,\r\nunarmored gun-boats, recourse was had to a structure of circular\r\nform, which with heavy weights could carry a great displacement upon\r\na relatively small draught. Two of these batteries, the _Novgorod_\r\nand the _Admiral Popoff_, were laid down, the dimensions of the\r\nlatter being as follows: extreme diameter 121 feet, diameter of\r\nbottom 96 feet, depth of hold at centre 14 feet, extreme draught 14\r\nfeet, and displacement 3550 tons. The nominal horse-power was 640,\r\nand the number of screws six; the armament consisted of two 41-ton\r\nbreech-loading guns mounted _en barbette_ 13 feet 3 inches above\r\nthe water-load line, and of four smaller pieces in an unarmored\r\nbreastwork. The _Novgorod_ attained on her trial eight and a half\r\nknots, and the _Popoff_ had a mean speed of eight knots.\r\n\r\nThe Russians were the first to solve the problem of an armored\r\ncruiser in which great speed could be combined with effective\r\nprotection against the guns of a majority of the high-sea ships then\r\nafloat. The _General Admiral_, launched in 1873, and the best known\r\nof this class, is built of iron, wood sheathed under water, and\r\ncoppered. She is 285 feet 9 inches in length, 48 feet 2 inches in\r\nbeam, and with 21 feet mean draught has 4438 tons displacement. She\r\nwas designed to steam 13 knots, carry 1000 tons of fuel, and have a\r\ncoal endurance of 5900 miles at 10 knots; the battery and belt are\r\narmored with six-inch plates; the belt is seven feet wide at the\r\nwater-line, and has, level with its upper edge, a highly curved deck\r\nof iron. The type proved so successful that it has been reproduced\r\nand improved in most of the great navies.\r\n\r\nThe _Catherine II._, _Tchesme_, and the _Sinope_ are the most\r\npowerful battle-ships of the Russian fleet. The first and second\r\nwere launched in May, 1886, the third in June, 1887; they are built\r\nof iron and steel (wood sheathed and coppered), have ram bows, and\r\nare of the following dimensions: length 339 feet, beam 69 feet, mean\r\ndraught 26.5 feet, displacement 10,181 tons. They are encircled\r\nby a belt of compound armor twelve to eighteen inches thick, and\r\nhave a complete 3-inch protective deck. Within a 14-inch armored\r\npear-shaped redoubt six 12-inch rifles are pair-mounted on Moncrieff\r\ndisappearing barbette carriages; seven 6-inch guns are carried on the\r\ngun-deck—six in broadside and one on a shifting pivot mount—and\r\nthe secondary battery is composed of seven Hotchkiss revolving\r\ncannon and seven torpedo-tubes. The engines of the _Catherine II._\r\nand the _Tchesme_ are of the vertical compound three-cylinder type,\r\nand are to develop 11,000 horse-power and 16 knots; the engines of\r\nthe _Sinope_ are of the triple-expansion type, and are to develop\r\n10,000 horse-power with natural, and 13,000 with forced, draught. The\r\ncost of each vessel will be about $4,500,000. The second ship of the\r\n_Emperor Alexander II._ type, now building at St. Petersburg by the\r\nFranco-Russian Company, and named the _Nicholas the First_, is to be\r\n8440 tons in displacement, 327 feet in length, 67 feet in beam, and\r\nhave 25.5 feet draught. These ships carry a complete belt of steel\r\narmor six to fourteen inches thick and nine feet wide, and a curved\r\nsteel deck, three inches thick, covers their under-water bodies. The\r\nbattery is to consist of two 12-inch guns, mounted in a pear-shaped\r\nbarbette tower forward; in the broadside there are to be four 9-inch,\r\neight 6-inch, and four 3.5-inch rifles, together with a number of\r\nHotchkiss guns. The barbette tower has steel armor, ten inches\r\nthick, and the usual torpedo-tubes are to be supplied. The estimated\r\nhorse-power is 8000 and the speed 16 knots.\r\n\r\nThe _Vitias_ and _Rynda_, steel cruisers, in which the vital parts\r\nwill be covered by a curved steel deck one and a half inches thick,\r\nare of 2965 tons displacement, develop 3000 indicated horse-power,\r\nand have a speed of 15 knots. The _Pamjatj Azowa_, a cruiser of\r\nthe _Impérieuse_ type, with a partially armored belt and barbette\r\nbatteries, is expected to develop 8000 indicated horse-power and 17\r\nknots.\r\n\r\nThe rapid, unarmored steel cruiser building at St. Nazaire, and named\r\nthe _Admiral Korniloff_, is of 5000 tons displacement, has triple\r\nexpansion engines, a curved steel deck to protect the machinery and\r\nboilers, and a cellular subdivision, which it is hoped will insure\r\nstability in case of perforation at or below the water-line. For the\r\nBlack Sea fleet six heavy gun-vessels have been projected; these\r\nare the _Uralets_, _Tereto_, _Kubanets_, _Zaporojets_, _Donets_,\r\nand _Chernomorets_, of 1224 tons displacement and 2000 horse-power;\r\ntheir armament is to be two 8-inch guns, one 6-inch breech-loading\r\ngun, two 6-pound rapid-fire pieces, four revolving cannons, and\r\ntwo torpedo-tubes. The _Bobr_ and _Sivoutch_ are heavily armored\r\ngun-vessels of a new type; the _Coreets_ and _Manchooria_ are small\r\ntwin-screw cruisers of 1213 tons displacement, and the _Aleuta_ is a\r\ntransport, the interior arrangements of which are designed mainly for\r\nthe storage and distribution of high explosives and torpedoes.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable development of machine-gun fire on board\r\ntorpedo-vessels is shown in the _Iljin_ and the _Saken_, a type\r\nwhich occupies the middle ground between the smaller class of French\r\ntorpedo-cruisers and the British torpedo-boat catchers. The _Iljin_\r\ncarries twelve revolving cannons and seven Hotchkiss rapid-fire\r\nguns, and has seven above-water torpedo-tubes, one on each side of\r\nthe stem, one on the port side of the stern, and four in broadside.\r\nRussia has a most effective fleet of torpedo-boats, some of which\r\nhave attained very high speeds under the usual test conditions of\r\ncarrying 14½ tons of ballast, coal sufficient for 1200 miles, and a\r\ncrew of eighteen. The Russian officers have already shown their skill\r\nand daring in this system of warfare, and, should they be called\r\nupon, there is no doubt that the whole capacity of these boats will\r\nbe tested under the guidance of a courage and an intelligence which\r\nare unsurpassed in any other navy of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 1887, a new naval programme was announced by the\r\nSpanish Government, and the following types and numbers of vessels\r\nwere designated as necessary for the modern fleet:\r\n\r\n1. Eleven protected steel cruisers: eight to be of 3200 tons, and\r\nthree of 4500 tons displacement. The armament will be of the 9.45 or\r\nthe 11-inch calibre Hontoria breech-loading guns, mounted on central\r\npivots, with smaller pieces in broadside and a secondary battery of\r\nrapid-fire guns and torpedoes. All the ships are to be constructed\r\non the cellular system, with double bottoms and water-tight\r\ncompartments, are to have triple-expansion engines and twin screws,\r\nand are expected to attain a speed of 19 knots with natural, and 21\r\nknots with forced draft.\r\n\r\n2. Six steel torpedo-cruisers of 1500 tons displacement and a speed\r\nof 23 knots. They are to mount central-pivot guns from 6.3 to 7\r\ninches in calibre, in addition to a number of smaller broadside guns,\r\nrevolving cannons, and torpedoes.\r\n\r\n3. Four torpedo-cruisers of 1100 tons displacement, to develop a\r\nspeed of from 18 to 21 knots, and to be furnished with a heavy\r\nprimary and the usual secondary battery.\r\n\r\n4. Twelve steel torpedo gun-boats, six to be of 600 tons\r\ndisplacement, and six of 350 tons, with a speed of not less than 16\r\nknots.\r\n\r\n5. Sixteen steel torpedo gun-boats of 200 or 250 tons displacement,\r\nwith a speed of 14 to 16 knots.\r\n\r\n6. Ninety-six torpedo-boats, 100 to 120 tons displacement, with a\r\nmaximum speed of 24 knots, and a coal endurance of 1500 miles.\r\n\r\n7. Forty-two torpedo-boats of 60 to 70 tons displacement.\r\n\r\n8. One transport of 3000 tons, to be equipped as a floating arsenal\r\nor machine-shop.\r\n\r\n9. Twenty steel steam-launches of from 30 to 35 tons displacement,\r\nbuilt on the life-boat system, and fitted with triple-expansion\r\nengines, to drive the boats from 12 to 14 knots per hour.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the new fleet will be:\r\n\r\n  For new vessels                        189,900,000  Pesetas.\r\n  For completing vessels now building     22,600,000     ”\r\n  For arsenals                            10,000,000     ”\r\n  For submarine defence                    2,500,000     ”\r\n                                         -----------\r\n                           Total         225,000,000[46] ”\r\n\r\nWhen these vessels are finished Spain will have the following fleet:\r\n\r\n        NEW VESSELS.                         PRESENT VESSELS.\r\n\r\n  Armor-clad                    1      Armor-clads                   2\r\n  First-class cruisers         12      First-class cruisers          6\r\n  Second-class cruisers        13      Second-class cruisers        16\r\n  Torpedo gun-boats            32      Smaller vessels              37\r\n  First-class torpedo-boats   100                                  ---\r\n  Second-class torpedo-boats   50            Total afloat           61\r\n  Steam-launches               20      To be constructed           229\r\n  Arsenal transport             1                                  ---\r\n                              ---            Grand total of fleet  290\r\n         Total                229\r\n\r\nIn the _Reina Regente_ the Spanish government expects to have the\r\nfastest cruiser afloat. Her keel was laid in the Thompson’s Yard\r\nat Clydebank on June 11, 1886, and she was launched February 24,\r\n1887. She is built of steel, is 320 feet in length, 50 feet 7 inches\r\nin beam, has a sea-going displacement of 4800 tons, and with her\r\nfull capacity of coal and stores on board, a displacement of 5600\r\ntons. The motive power consists of two independent, horizontal,\r\ntriple-expansion engines (each working in its own compartment),\r\nwhich are capable of developing with forced draft 12,000 indicated\r\nhorse-power and a speed of 20.5 knots. The battery will consist of\r\nfour 9.45-inch Hontoria rifles, mounted on platforms raised four\r\nfeet above the deck, and situated two forward and two abaft the\r\nsuperstructure; of six 4.72-inch Hontoria guns, two mounted each side\r\non sponsons, and one each side in a recessed port; of eight 6-pounder\r\nrapid-fire guns, six revolving cannons, and five above-water\r\ntorpedo-tubes. The ship has a complete steel deck, curving from about\r\nsix feet below the water-line to its horizontal height; this latter\r\nsection is about one-third the width of the ship, and is three inches\r\nthick over the engines and boilers, and one inch thick for the rest,\r\nwhile the inclined and curved sides are four and three-quarter inches\r\nthick. To assist in excluding water when pierced, a complete belt of\r\ncellulose extends around the ship inside the inner skin, and about\r\nthe height of the water-line.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo-boat chaser _Destructor_ is not only a good sea-boat,\r\nand capable of making a long passage at high speed, but has proved\r\nherself to be one of the fastest vessels afloat. She has 350 tons\r\nnormal displacement, and when fully loaded and equipped 458 tons. Her\r\nengines have developed 3829 indicated horse-power. During ten days\r\nin November, 1886, a maximum speed of 23¾ knots was attained, and on\r\nDecember 13th of that year she reached a mean speed for four hours\r\nof 22.65 knots, and an estimated coal endurance of 5100 miles at 11½\r\nknots, and of 700 miles at full speed. In January, 1887, she ran in\r\ntwenty four hours from Falmouth to Finisterre, thus covering the 495\r\nmiles at a mean speed of 21 knots.\r\n\r\nThe _Pelayo_, a barbette ship of the _Amiral Duperré_ class, has a\r\ncomplete water-line belt of steel, 6 feet 11 inches wide, and from\r\n11.8 to 17.72 inches thick. The steel armor on the barbette towers\r\nis 11.8 inches, and the protective deck which extends throughout her\r\nlength is 3.5 inches thick. The dimensions are as follows: Length\r\n344 feet 6 inches, beam 66 feet 3 inches, draught 24 feet 8 inches,\r\nand displacement 9902 tons. The armament consists of two 12.6-inch\r\n48-ton guns in the barbettes; of two 11-inch guns on sponsons, one\r\neach side; of twelve 4.72-inch guns in broadside, and of one 6.3-inch\r\npiece in the bow. The secondary battery is composed of fourteen\r\nrapid-fire and machine guns and seven torpedo-tubes. The contract\r\nhorse-power is 7000, the speed 15 knots, and the coal endurance (the\r\nsupply being 700 tons) is sufficient for 885 miles at 15 knots, and\r\n2340 miles at 13 knots. The five ships of the _Infanta Isabel_ class\r\nare launched, and the small steel cruisers _Isla de Luzon_ and _Isla\r\nde Cuba_ are rapidly approaching completion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\n\r\nAustria has under construction this year the two armor coast-defence\r\nvessels described in the text: the _Tiger_, a 3800 ton protected\r\ncruiser of the latest type, and the _Meteor_, a torpedo-cruiser of\r\nthe _Leopard_ and _Panther_ class. These last-mentioned important\r\nadditions to the fleet are 224 feet long, 34 feet beam, 14 feet\r\ndraught, and of 1550 tons displacement. They differ from the English\r\n_Condor_ and the French _Archer_ in these particulars: first, the\r\nsteel protective deck is not continuous; secondly, the engines are\r\nof the vertical, inverted, triple-expansion type; and thirdly, the\r\nengine cylinders are protected by steel shields surrounded by coal\r\nor sand-bags. The armament consists of four large-range Krupp guns,\r\nmounted in sponsoned turrets, of numerous machine and rapid-fire\r\npieces, and of four above-water torpedo-tubes. Under natural draft\r\n17.6 knots, and with forced 18.9 knots, were accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe 87-ton torpedo-boats _Falke_ and _Adler_, built by Messrs. Yarrow\r\n& Co., are 135 feet long, with 14 feet beam, 5½ feet draught aft and\r\n2¼ feet forward. The engines are of the three-cylinder, compound,\r\nsurface-condensing type, and developed 1250 horse-power and 22.4\r\nknots in fighting trim. The coal supply of twenty-eight tons is\r\nexpected to give an endurance of two thousand miles at ten knots.\r\nTheir armament is composed of two machine guns and two torpedo-tubes,\r\nwhich discharge straight ahead. The _Habicht_, a 90-ton torpedo-boat,\r\nbuilt by Schichau, was designed to develop with a load of 14½ tons a\r\nspeed of 20½ knots, and to have a coal endurance of 3500 miles at a\r\n10-knot rate; but on trial she realized 21.77 knots for three hours.\r\nIt is understood that future boats will be much larger, approaching\r\n300 to 400 tons displacement. The budget for 1887 provides 720,000\r\nflorins for torpedo-boats and vessels.\r\n\r\nThough Austria holds a secondary place as a maritime power, she is,\r\nof all the Continental nations, the one most liable to precipitate\r\nthe next great war, and it seems strange, therefore, that she does\r\nnot try to acquire a great number of those special classes of ships\r\nwhich, after all, are the only logical answers the weaker naval\r\ncountries can make to the more powerful.\r\n\r\n“While the Austrian military position, in spite of the desire of\r\nthe emperor for military reform, is still weak, I cannot find words\r\ntoo strong to praise the political ability with which the Austrian\r\nempire is being kept at peace and kept together. The Austrian empire\r\nis a marvel of equilibrium. The old simile of a house of cards is\r\nexactly applicable to its situation; and just as in the exercises of\r\nacrobats, when seven or nine men are borne by one upon his shoulders,\r\nit is rather skill than strength which sustains them; so, if we look\r\nto the Austrian constitution, which we shall have to consider in the\r\nnext paper in this series, it is a miracle how the fabric stands at\r\nall. At the same time it is impossible for Austria, although she can\r\nmaintain her stability in times of peace, to impose upon either her\r\nRussian or her German neighbors as to her strength for war. Prince\r\nBismarck is obliged, with whatever words of public and private praise\r\nfor the speeches of the Austrian and Hungarian statesmen, to add the\r\nFrench and Russian forces together upon his fingers, and to deduct\r\nfrom them the Austrian and the German, with doubts as to the attitude\r\nof Italy, doubts as to the attitude of England, and contemptuous\r\ncertainty as to the attitude of Turkey.\r\n\r\n“If Austria could have presented Prince Bismarck not only with an\r\nEnglish alliance, but with an English, Turkish, and Italian alliance,\r\nhe might possibly have allowed her to provoke a general war; but\r\nwith the difficulties attendant upon a concession of territory to\r\nItaly, except in the last resort, and with Turkey at the feet of\r\nRussia, it was difficult for Prince Bismarck to go further than to\r\nsay to Austria, ‘Fight by all means, if you feel yourself strong\r\nenough to beat Russia single-handed. France and Germany will “see all\r\nfair,” and you can hardly expect anybody effectually to help you.’\r\nPrince Bismarck deals with foreign affairs on the principles upon\r\nwhich they were dealt with by King Henry VIII. of England, when that\r\nking was pitted against the acutest intellects of the empire and of\r\nFrance. His policy is a plain and simple policy, and not a policy of\r\nastuteness and cunning, and almost necessarily at the present time\r\nconsists in counting heads.”[47]\r\n\r\nThere have been no additions of any importance to the fleets of the\r\nother European powers since the publication of Sir Edward Reed’s\r\narticle, and their policy has in no way been changed from that\r\nepitomized in the text. The apathy of Germany is inexplicable, and\r\nas for the others, there seem, except with Turkey, perhaps, no good\r\nreasons why they should strive to create fleets, as they are either\r\ntoo poor to build and support them, or their dangers from maritime\r\nattack are not great enough to make a large navy necessary.\r\n\r\nHolland has lately launched the _Johan Willem Friso_, which is the\r\nlast of six large cruisers, “of which the others are the _Atjeh_,\r\n_Tromp_, _Konigin Emma der Nederlanden_, _De Ruyter_, and _Van\r\nSpeyk_.... All these vessels are built of iron and steel, sheathed\r\nwith wood to four feet above the water-line, and coppered. They are\r\nof 3400 tons displacement and of the following dimensions: Length\r\n262 feet 5 inches, beam 39 feet 4 inches, and mean draught 18 feet 4\r\ninches. Their armament is six 6.7-inch Krupp guns (one carried in the\r\nbow, one in the stern, and the others in broadside), four 4.72-inch\r\nKrupp pieces in broadside, six 37-millimetre revolving cannons, and\r\na supply of Whitehead torpedoes. The engines drive single screws,\r\nand have an estimated horse-power of 3000, which has been slightly\r\nexceeded by some and not attained by others. The speeds vary from\r\n14.1 knots to 14.7 knots. The coal supply is 400 tons—sufficient for\r\nsix and three-quarter days’ steaming at full speed or for thirteen\r\ndays at ten knots.”[48]\r\n\r\nDenmark has the _Valkyrien_, a steel cruiser of 2900 tons, fitted\r\nwith a good battery and five torpedo-tubes, and designed to develop\r\n5000 horse-power and 17 knots. Her new double-turreted, armored,\r\ncoast-defence vessel _Iver Huitfeldt_ has developed a maximum speed\r\nof 15.6 knots.\r\n\r\nFrom data furnished by First-lieutenant Tasker H. Bliss, U.

The cost of each nation’s navy is in direct proportion\r\nto its strength of _personnel_; but in armies England, though last in\r\nnumbers, changes place with Italy, which supports its forces with the\r\nleast expenditure.

Russia has 20 guns and\r\nSpain 2 which can pierce 24 inches of iron. No other power has any\r\nguns capable of equivalent results. In other words, of guns able to\r\npenetrate 24 inches of unbacked iron, France has 28, Italy 20, Russia\r\n20, Spain 2, and Great Britain 22.\r\n\r\nIn war-ships of 20 knots and above, England has 1, France 1, Italy\r\n10, Spain 2, and other European nations 4; of 19 knots speed, England\r\nhas 11 ships, France 10, Germany 3, Italy 2, and other nations 9;\r\nof 18-knot ships, England has 5, France 7, Germany 2, Italy 6, and\r\nother nations 6. English supremacy is, however, chiefly seen in\r\n17-knot ships, of which she has 25, mounting 181 guns; France, 4 with\r\n20 guns; Italy, 5 with 40 guns; and other nations 4 with 19 guns.\r\nEngland has 11 ships of 90 guns that can steam 16 knots, whereas\r\nFrance has 3 only of 58 guns. At 15 knots, France has 16 ships of 214\r\nguns, and England 12 ships of 126 guns; and at 14 knots, France has\r\n28 ships of 334 guns, and England 15 ships of 252 guns. Summarizing\r\nthese figures, it appears that with speeds above 14 knots England has\r\n80 ships of 795 guns, France 69 of 699 guns, Germany 35 of 285 guns,\r\nand Italy 41 of 201 guns.\r\n\r\nOut of a total mercantile tonnage now afloat of 20,943,650, Great\r\nBritain and her colonies own 10,539,136. The total steam mercantile\r\ntonnage of the world is 10,531,843, and of this Great Britain and her\r\ncolonies own 6,595,871, or nearly two-thirds of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES NAVY.\r\n\r\nIN TRANSITION.\r\n\r\nBY REAR-ADMIRAL EDWARD SIMPSON, U.S.N.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of the navy of the United States is not such as any\r\ncitizen of the country would desire. Pride in their navy was one of\r\nthe earliest sentiments that inspired the hearts of the people when\r\nthe United States took their place as a nation, and the memory of\r\nits deeds has not faded during the subsequent years of the country’s\r\naggrandizement. Time was when that section of the country most remote\r\nfrom the sea-coast was indifferent to it, owing to the more immediate\r\ndemand on its attention for the development of internal resources;\r\nbut the rapid settlement of our Western lands, and the annihilation\r\nof distance produced by rapid communication, have tended to preserve\r\nthe unity of interests of the separate sections, and the happy system\r\nthat obtains through which officers are appointed to the navy keeps\r\nit an object of personal concern to all the States of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the navy is not such as to satisfy the\r\ndesire of the people that it should be sustained on a footing\r\ncommensurate with the position of the nation, and in keeping with\r\nits ancient reputation. For many years circumstances have intervened\r\nto prevent a judicious rehabilitation of the navy, notwithstanding\r\nthat its needs have been faithfully presented to Congress year after\r\nyear. The country has been wonderfully favored with peace at home and\r\nabroad, and no urgent call to arms has roused the nation to prepare\r\nfor war. The rapidity with which a large fleet of cruising ships for\r\nblockading purposes was extemporized during our civil war has left a\r\nhurtful impression on the public mind that in an emergency a similar\r\neffort might prove equally efficacious—disregarding altogether the\r\ndifference in circumstances of contending with an enemy possessed of\r\na naval force and with one possessed of none. The economists have\r\nsuggested that as all that relates to ships, guns, and motive forces\r\nwas being rapidly developed by others, it would be a saving of the\r\npeople’s money to await results, and to benefit by the experience of\r\nothers; and, again, party rivalry and contentions have assisted to\r\npostpone action.\r\n\r\nIt has never been the intention that the navy should die from neglect\r\nand be obliterated. Yearly appropriations have been faithfully\r\npassed for the support of the _personnel_, and for such repairs\r\nas were found to be indispensable for the old ships that have\r\nbeen kept in commission; but it is now seen that this system of\r\ntemporizing has been the poorest kind of economy. This money has been\r\ninvested necessarily in perishable material, the amounts have been\r\ninsufficient to compass new constructions, whether in ships or guns,\r\nand the only use that could be made of them was to repair wooden\r\nships and convert cast-iron guns, whereas the work needed was to\r\nconstruct steel ships and to fabricate steel guns.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the navy of the past, it is impossible to avoid\r\nrecalling the feeling of pride with which an American seaman—officer\r\nor man—walked the deck of his ship. This feeling was common to the\r\nnaval and commercial marine. Our wooden ships that sailed the ocean\r\nfrom 1840 to 1860 were the finest in the world. The old frigate\r\n_Congress_ in 1842 was the noblest specimen of the frigates of the\r\nday, and the sloop-of-war _Portsmouth_ was unsurpassed as a corvette.\r\nThe clipper ships of that period need no eulogy beyond their own\r\nrecord. These ships were the models for the imitation of all maritime\r\nnations, and among the constructors of the period can be recalled,\r\nwithout detriment to many others omitted, the names of Lenthall,\r\nSteers, Pook, and Delano. The poetry of sailing reached its zenith\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\nBut there is no sentiment in progress; its demands are practical and\r\nimperative, and the great motive power, steam, was being crowded to\r\nthe front even during this the greatest development in the era of\r\nsails. Advanced ideas could not be resisted, and steam was admitted\r\nas an auxiliary; but our development in naval construction still\r\nstood us in good stead, and enabled us to supply ships with auxiliary\r\nsteam-power, which continued to be prominent for many years as\r\nstandards to which others found it to their advantage to conform.\r\n\r\nBefore the final abandonment in the navy of sailing-ships, pure and\r\nsimple, an effort at a compromise was made by limiting steam to\r\nside-wheel vessels, and a number of fine ships were built in the\r\nforties which did good service, and were a credit to the country,\r\nanswering as they did the demands of the time. The _Mississippi_,\r\n_Missouri_, _Susquehanna_, _Saranac_, and _Powhatan_ carried the flag\r\nto all parts of the world for many years, some of them enduring to\r\nbear their share in the late war, while the _Powhatan_ was borne on\r\nthe list of vessels of the navy until within a few months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SIDE-WHEEL STEAMER “POWHATAN.”]\r\n\r\nThis vessel was built at Norfolk, Virginia, in the year 1850. Her\r\nlength was 250 feet, beam 45 feet, draught of water 19.6 feet. She\r\nhad a displacement of 3980 tons, and attained a speed of 10.6 knots\r\nper hour with an indicated horse-power of 1172. The capacity of her\r\ncoal-bunkers was 630 tons. Her battery consisted of sixteen 9-inch\r\nsmooth-bore guns. She was built of seasoned live-oak, and though\r\nfrequently under repairs, retained so much of the strength of her\r\noriginal construction that she escaped the sentence of condemnation\r\nuntil recently.\r\n\r\nThe _Princeton_, of great fame, and the _San Jacinto_, were the\r\nonly ships with screw-propellers that appeared in the period under\r\nconsideration, the screw then being considered of such doubtful\r\npropriety as to need the test of tentative experiments. These ships\r\nhave long since disappeared, but the screw remains, and side-wheels\r\nare mainly relegated to boats for inland waters.\r\n\r\nConfidence being established in the screw-propeller, construction\r\non the principle of auxiliary steam-power was decided on, and ships\r\nof different classes were added to the navy in such numbers as the\r\nvaried duties required.\r\n\r\nThere were those at that time who, wise beyond their generation,\r\nrecognized the full meaning of the advent of steam, and saw that it\r\nmust supplant sails altogether as the motive power for ships. These\r\nadvocated that new constructions should be given full steam-power,\r\nwith sails as an auxiliary. But the old pride in the sailing-ship,\r\nwith her taunt and graceful spars, could not be made to yield at\r\nonce to the innovation; nor could the old traditions pointing to\r\nthe necessity of full sail-power be dispelled; so it was considered\r\na sufficient concession to admit steam on any terms, and thus the\r\nconservative and temporizing course was adopted of retaining full\r\nsail-power, and utilizing steam as an auxiliary.\r\n\r\nThe United States government was not alone in this policy. It was the\r\ncourse pursued by all other maritime nations, and for some years the\r\nUnited States retained the lead in producing the most perfect types\r\nin this new phase of naval construction.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Congress passed an act authorizing the construction of the\r\n_Merrimac_ class of frigates. The famous ships immediately built\r\nunder this act were the _Merrimac_, _Wabash_, _Minnesota_, _Roanoke_,\r\nand _Colorado_. All of these vessels got to sea during 1856 and 1857,\r\nand were followed, at an interval of ten years, by the _Franklin_,\r\nwhich was a larger ship, and an improvement on the original type.\r\n\r\nThe _Franklin_ was built at Kittery, Maine. Her length is 266 feet,\r\nbeam 54 feet, draught of water 24 feet. She has a displacement\r\nof 5170 tons, and attains a speed of 10 knots per hour with an\r\nindicated horse-power of 2065. The capacity of her coal-bunkers is\r\n860 tons. Her frames are of seasoned live-oak, and she is in use as a\r\nreceiving-ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. FRIGATE “FRANKLIN,” OF THE “MERRIMAC” CLASS.]\r\n\r\nThe _Merrimac_ was the first vessel of this type which got to sea.\r\nShe was sent to European waters, and on her arrival in England, early\r\nin 1856, she became at once the object of the closest scrutiny,\r\nresulting in the unqualified approval of foreign naval architects.\r\nThe English Admiralty proceeded to imitate the type, and many keels\r\nwere soon laid in order to reproduce it. The ships built after this\r\nmodel were the crack ships of the time in the English navy, and\r\ncarried the flags of the commanders-in-chief of fleets.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, 1859, and 1860, the _Hartford_ class of large corvettes\r\nappeared. These are full-rigged ships. The class comprises the\r\n_Hartford_, _Brooklyn_, _Pensacola_, _Richmond_, and _Lancaster_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “HARTFORD.”]\r\n\r\nThe _Hartford_ was built at Boston in 1858. Her length is 225 feet,\r\nbeam 44 feet, draught of water 18.3. She has a displacement of 2900\r\ntons, and attains a speed of 10 knots per hour with an indicated\r\nhorse-power of 940. The capacity of her coal-bunkers is 241 tons.\r\nHer battery consists of one 8-inch muzzle-loading rifle (converted)\r\nand 12 9-inch smooth-bores. These ships were built of live-oak, and\r\nendure to the present day. They were reproduced by England and France\r\nwhen they made their appearance, and are now, except the _Trenton_,\r\nthe only ships in service which can accommodate a commander-in-chief\r\nof a squadron. They are kept constantly employed showing the flag\r\nabroad, but it is with difficulty that they are retained in suitable\r\nrepair for service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “BROOKLYN.”]\r\n\r\nThis class of ships has good speed under sail, with the wind free,\r\nbut their light draught prevents them from being weatherly on a wind.\r\nMuch of their cruising is done under sail, which tends to lengthen\r\ntheir existence. Under the late act of Congress prohibiting repairs\r\non wooden ships when the expense shall exceed twenty per cent. of\r\nthe cost of a new vessel, these ships must soon disappear from the\r\nnavy list. When that time shall arrive, and steel cruisers shall\r\nbe substituted, the name of the _Hartford_ should be preserved as\r\nclosely associated with the glory that Farragut shed upon the navy.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 a new type of sloop-of-war was introduced, of which the\r\n_Kearsarge_ will serve as an example. This ship was built at\r\nKittery, Maine; her length is 199 feet, beam 33 feet, draught of\r\nwater 15.9 feet. She has a displacement of 1550 tons, and attains a\r\nspeed of 11 knots per hour with an indicated horse-power of 842. The\r\ncapacity of her coal-bunkers is 165 tons. Her battery consists of two\r\n8-inch muzzle-loading rifles (converted), four 9-inch smooth-bores,\r\nand one 60-pounder. This has proved a very handy class of vessel,\r\nand for the year in which they were built were considered as having\r\nvery fair speed under steam, the proportion of space occupied by\r\nboilers and engines being more than had been assigned in previous\r\nconstructions. Several ships of this class were launched and put in\r\ncommission before the war, and gave a new impetus to construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “KEARSARGE.”]\r\n\r\nThe types of vessels that were built during the war were selected for\r\nspecial purposes. The effort was made to multiply ships as rapidly\r\nas possible to blockade the coast and to enter shoal harbors; the\r\n“ninety-day gun-boats” and the “double-enders” were added to the navy\r\nlist, and merchant-steamers were purchased, and were armed with such\r\nbatteries as their scantling would bear. All of these vessels have\r\ndisappeared, with the exception of the _Tallapoosa_. The _Juniata_\r\nand _Ossipee_, of the _Kearsarge_ type, but of greater displacement,\r\nwere launched in 1862, and are still in service; and at about the\r\nclose of the war several vessels of large displacement and great\r\nspeed were launched which were never taken into service, have been\r\ndisposed of since, and form no part of our present navy.\r\n\r\nThe _New Ironsides_ and the _Monitor_ represented the two features\r\nof construction which, produced in that period of emergency, have\r\ncontinued to impress naval architecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. IRON-CLAD “NEW IRONSIDES.”]\r\n\r\nAs a sea-going iron-clad the _New Ironsides_ was, for the time and\r\nservice required, a success. She was built at the yard of Mr. Cramp,\r\nin Philadelphia, in 1862. Her length was 230 feet, beam 56 feet,\r\ndraught of water 15 feet. She had a displacement of 4015 tons, and\r\nattained a speed of six knots per hour with an indicated horse-power\r\nof 700. The capacity of the coal-bunkers was 350 tons. Her battery\r\nconsisted of twenty 11-inch smooth-bore guns. She was built of wood,\r\nand was covered with armor four inches in thickness, which, with the\r\ninclination given to her sides, made her impervious to the artillery\r\nthat was used against her during the war. In one engagement with the\r\nbatteries on Sullivan’s Island, Charleston Harbor, lasting three\r\nhours, she was struck seventy times, but at the end of the action,\r\nexcept some damage to a port shutter or two, she withdrew in as\r\nperfect fighting condition as when the fight commenced. This ship\r\ndoes not appear on the navy list, as she was destroyed by fire off\r\nthe navy-yard at League Island, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe _Monitor_ was, without doubt, the most remarkable production\r\nof the constructive art that appeared during the war. The original\r\n_Monitor_ was lost at sea, but our illustration presents the\r\n_Passaic_ class of Monitors, which quickly followed the original of\r\nthis type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. MONITOR “PASSAIC.”]\r\n\r\nThe _Passaic_ was built of iron, and was launched in 1862. Her\r\nlength is 200 feet, beam 46 feet, draught of water 11.6 feet. She\r\nhas a displacement of 1875 tons, and attains a speed of seven knots\r\nper hour with an indicated horse-power of 377. The capacity of\r\nher coal-bunkers is 140 tons. Her battery consists of one 15-inch\r\nsmooth-bore and one 11-inch smooth-bore. Her sides are protected\r\nby five inches of laminated iron, and her turret by eleven inches\r\nof the same. This vessel and eleven others of her class constitute\r\nthe entire armored fleet of the United States. Too much credit\r\ncannot be awarded to Captain Ericsson for his brilliant conception\r\nof this floating battery, and the navy must be ever grateful to him\r\nfor preserving it from the dire disaster which was averted by the\r\nappearance of the original _Monitor_ at the moment of a great crisis.\r\nThese vessels bore themselves well through the storms of elements\r\nand battle during the war, proving capable of making sea-voyages,\r\nand of resisting the effects of the artillery that was in use during\r\nthe period of their usefulness; but an interval of more than\r\ntwenty years has produced such a change in artillery as to make the\r\nprotection afforded by a few laminated plates of one-inch iron but a\r\npoor defence against weapons which have robbed this fleet of its once\r\nformidable character. Although many of the features of the original\r\ndesign may be retained in new constructions, most of the details will\r\nbe changed, notably in the turret, in consequence of the greater\r\nweight resulting from the increased thickness of armor. The central\r\nspindle around which the Ericsson turret revolves must disappear, and\r\nthe turret must turn on rollers under the base.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced abroad by the success of Ericsson’s _Monitor_ is\r\nso familiar to all that it hardly needs more than a passing allusion\r\nhere. There is no doubt that the _Monitor_ was the progenitor\r\nof all the turreted vessels in the fleets of the world, though\r\nthe essential principle of the vessel, however, was never viewed\r\nwith favor. This principle consists in the low freeboard, which,\r\nbesides reducing the size of the target, is intended to contribute\r\nto the steadiness of the hull as a gun-platform by offering no\r\nresistance to the waves that are expected to wash freely over the\r\nvessel’s deck: the horizontal overhang of the _Passaic_ class is\r\nintended to contribute to resisting a rolling motion. The vessel\r\nwas designed to be as a raft on the water, constantly submerged by\r\nthe passing waves, hermetically sealed to prevent the admission\r\nof water, and artificially ventilated by means of blowers drawing\r\nair down through the turret. This was the most startling feature\r\nabout the construction. The protection afforded to the battery by a\r\ncircular turret having the form best suited to deflect projectiles,\r\nthe employment of machinery to point the guns by the rotation of the\r\nturret, the protection to motive power, to anchoring apparatus, etc.,\r\nall presented admirable points of advantage, but the almost perfect\r\nimmersion of the hull, and the absence of motion due to the _great\r\nstability_, are the essential features in the construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. DOUBLE-TURRETED MONITOR “TERROR.”]\r\n\r\nThe double-turreted Monitors, of which the _Terror_ indicates the\r\nclass, were built with a sponson, and it would have been better for\r\nthe navy if this had been the only deviation made from the original\r\ndesign of Captain Ericsson. But it was not; the great mistake\r\nwas made of building this class of Monitors of wood—a style of\r\nconstruction which had been already condemned abroad, in consequence\r\nof the impossibility of repairing an armored vessel so constructed,\r\nit being necessary to remove the armor for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe _Miantonomoh_, _Monadnock_, and _Terror_ were completed and put\r\nin commission. The _Miantonomoh_ made a cruise to European waters,\r\nspreading the fame of Ericsson, and proving the ability of a vessel\r\nof this type to navigate the high seas; the _Monadnock_ made the\r\nvoyage to the Pacific, passing through the Strait of Magellan; and\r\nthe _Terror_ was for a time on service on our eastern coast; but\r\ntheir lifetime was of short duration, and they are now being rebuilt,\r\nor rather new vessels, three of which bear their names, are now under\r\nconstruction of iron, which will serve to make them efficient and\r\ndurable.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be a digression at this point to call attention\r\nmore particularly to these double-turreted Monitors now under\r\nconstruction. They bear the following names, _viz._, _Puritan_,\r\n_Terror_, _Amphitrite_, _Miantonomoh_, and _Monadnock_. There was\r\nmuch contention about the completion of these vessels, and imaginary\r\ndefects were ventilated in the newspapers. It may be that these\r\nattacks and erroneous statements prejudiced the public mind, and\r\nthat the idea was entertained by some whose opinion is valued that\r\nthere were grounds for the doubts that had been expressed of their\r\nsea-worthiness. The practical effect of these statements was to\r\nprevent Congress from appropriating money for the completion of the\r\nvessels, and this course on the part of Congress might have confirmed\r\nsome in their doubts. Several boards of officers, most competent\r\nexperts, however, reported upon them, recommending their completion;\r\nof these that made by the Advisory Board may be regarded as a final\r\ndecision, for it was accepted without question. The Advisory Board\r\nreported as follows:\r\n\r\n  “It is our opinion that it would be wise and expedient to finish\r\n  these vessels at once, and for the following reasons, _viz._:\r\n\r\n  “1. The hulls, as they are at present, are of excellent\r\n  workmanship, fully up to the present standard condition of iron\r\n  ship construction, whilst the flotation of the _Puritan_ and the\r\n  behavior of the _Miantonomoh_ at sea confirm the correctness of the\r\n  calculations of the designs.\r\n\r\n  “2. It is easily possible to complete the vessels by taking\r\n  advantage of the recent developments in armor, guns, and machinery,\r\n  without making any radical changes in the designs, so that their\r\n  speed, endurance, battery power, protection, and sea-going\r\n  qualities shall be fully equal to those of any foreign iron-clad of\r\n  similar dimensions designed previous to 1879.\r\n\r\n  “3. The vessels may be finished so as to develop all the\r\n  above-mentioned advantages without making their total cost, when\r\n  completed, in any way exorbitant, compared with the results\r\n  obtained; again, the interests of our sea-coast defence require a\r\n  force at least equal to that which would be represented by these\r\n  vessels.\r\n\r\n  “We take the liberty of calling your attention to a certain\r\n  erroneous impression which now exists with regard to these vessels.\r\n  In one of the reports of these hulls a doubt was thrown on the\r\n  correctness of the calculations of the _Puritan_. This doubt has\r\n  spread in the public mind until it includes all the ships. The\r\n  actual flotation of the _Puritan_ and the _Miantonomoh_ proves\r\n  beyond question not only the reliability of the calculations, but\r\n  also that the hulls of these vessels are lighter in proportion to\r\n  the total displacement than those of any iron-clad low freeboard\r\n  hulls afloat, with two exceptions.\r\n\r\n  “It has been the unfortunate custom, in arguments as to the value\r\n  of the results to be obtained, to compare these vessels with such\r\n  foreign ships as the _Inflexible_ and the _Duilio_, to the evident\r\n  disadvantage of the Monitors, no account whatever being taken of\r\n  the fact that these vessels are double the size of the Monitors. If\r\n  these hulls be compared with foreign ones of similar dimensions, no\r\n  such disparity will appear.”\r\n\r\nThese vessels, with the exception of the _Monadnock_, have their\r\nmachinery in place; the _Miantonomoh_ has her side armor on; the\r\nothers are finished as to their hulls, except the interior fittings,\r\nside armor, and turrets. The estimated cost to complete them is about\r\nfour millions of dollars. When we consider the very slight defence\r\nthat the country now possesses in the single-turreted Monitors before\r\nalluded to, it would seem imperative to complete with all despatch\r\nthese vessels, which would represent a force of real power.\r\n\r\nThese vessels are of iron as to the hulls, but they will be armored\r\nwith steel or compound armor, and will be armed with the most\r\npowerful modern artillery that can be accommodated in their turrets.\r\nTheir names appear in the navy list as “building.” They were launched\r\nin 1883.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. FRIGATE “TENNESSEE.”]\r\n\r\nThe double-decked ship _Tennessee_ was the only frigate, or\r\n“first-rate,” borne, up to within a few months, on the list of\r\nvessels of the navy as available for sea service. She was for many\r\nyears in commission as the flag-ship of the North Atlantic Station,\r\nbut this year she reached that condition when the twenty per cent.\r\nlaw consigned her to “ordinary,” from which she has lately been\r\nremoved under the operation of the hammer of the auctioneer. She was\r\nlaunched in 1865. Her length was 335 feet, beam 45 feet, draught of\r\nwater 21.8 feet. She had a displacement of 4840 tons, and attained\r\na speed of 11 knots with an indicated horse-power of 1900. The\r\ncapacity of her coal-bunkers was 381 tons. Her battery consisted\r\nof two 8-inch muzzle-loading rifles (converted), sixteen 9-inch\r\nsmooth-bores, and four 80-pounders.\r\n\r\nThe vessels next in order of construction are those of the _Adams_\r\nclass, small sloops-of-war, which were launched in 1874.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “ADAMS.”]\r\n\r\nThese vessels were built of wood. They are convenient and handy,\r\nand perform the duty required of a cruiser in time of peace.\r\nEngine-power is developed in them to a higher degree than in those\r\npreceding them, but in all else they are merely a repetition of\r\nearlier constructions. The _Adams_ was launched in 1874. Her length\r\nis 185 feet, beam 35 feet, draught of water 14.3 feet. She has a\r\ndisplacement of 1375 tons, and attains a speed of 11.3 knots with\r\nan indicated horse-power of 715. The capacity of her coal-bunkers\r\nis 140 tons. Her battery consists of one 11-inch and four 9-inch\r\nsmooth-bores, and one 60-pounder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “MARION.”]\r\n\r\nThe _Marion_ class of sloops, launched about the same period, are of\r\nan increased displacement and speed, and built of wood. The length of\r\nthe _Marion_ is 216 feet, beam 37 feet, draught of water 16.6 feet.\r\nShe has a displacement of 1900 tons, and attains a speed of 12.9\r\nknots per hour with an indicated horse-power of 966. The capacity\r\nof her coal-bunkers is 135 tons. Her battery consists of one 8-inch\r\nmuzzle-loading rifle (converted), six 9-inch smooth-bores, and one\r\n60-pounder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “ALERT” (IRON).]\r\n\r\nThe _Alert_ is one of three vessels that were built of iron in 1874,\r\nthe exceptional and spasmodic indication of an effort to change the\r\nmaterial for construction, much induced by pressure from the iron\r\ninterests of the country. This effort was made in a very mild and\r\ntentative manner, and was limited to this small class of diminutive\r\nvessels. The length of the _Alert_ is 175 feet, beam 32 feet, draught\r\nof water 12.9 feet. She has a displacement of 1020 tons, and attains\r\na speed of ten knots per hour with an indicated horse-power of 655.\r\nThe capacity of her coal-bunkers is 133 tons. Her battery consists of\r\none 11-inch and four 9-inch smooth-bores, and one 60-pounder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “TRENTON.”]\r\n\r\nThe shock attending the first step towards a change in the material\r\nfor construction was so great as to cause a suspension of the\r\neffort, and in 1876 was launched the _Trenton_, built of wood,\r\nwhich represents the latest of that type on the list of the navy.\r\nThe length of this ship is 253 feet, beam 48 feet, draught of water\r\n20.6 feet. She has a displacement of 3900 tons, and attains a speed\r\nof 12.8 knots per hour with an indicated horse-power of 2813. The\r\ncapacity of her coal-bunkers is 350 tons. Her battery consists of ten\r\n8-inch muzzle-loading rifles (converted).\r\n\r\nThe above is a fair presentation of our old navy. Of such vessels\r\nwe have, larger and smaller, twenty-five which are fit for service\r\nas cruisers, exclusive of the old single-turreted Monitors. These\r\ncruisers are built of wood, have low speed, and are armed with\r\nsmooth-bore guns, with a sprinkling of rifled cannon, converted on\r\nthe Palliser system from smooth-bore cast-iron guns. Of what service\r\nis this force, this relic of a past age?\r\n\r\nThe duties of a navy, apart from the consideration of war, are\r\nmanifold. As stated by the first Advisory Board, it is required for\r\n“surveying, deep-sea sounding, the advancement and protection of\r\nAmerican commerce, exploration, the protection of American life and\r\nproperty endangered by wars between foreign countries, and service in\r\nsupport of American policy in matters where foreign governments are\r\nconcerned.”\r\n\r\nWith such a poor force it must be evident that it was impossible\r\nto discharge in an efficient manner all the duties of a navy. Our\r\nwork in foreign surveys is limited to that of one small vessel\r\non the west coast of North America; our deep-sea soundings are\r\nfew and far between, dotted along the tracks pursued by our ships\r\nwhile going to and returning from distant stations; our commerce is\r\nprotected; but we are unable to support any positive policy that the\r\ngovernment might decide to declare in reference to, for example,\r\nthe Monroe doctrine. To say nothing of European naval armaments, it\r\nis only necessary to point to some of the smaller powers in our own\r\nhemisphere that possess ships-of-war with which we have nothing fit\r\nto cope.\r\n\r\nOur people cannot desire to assume a position in the society of naval\r\npowers without supporting the position with dignity; they cannot wish\r\ntheir navy to be cited as a standard of inefficiency; they cannot\r\nwish to force their representatives (the officers of the navy) into a\r\nposition of humiliation and mortification such as is imposed by being\r\ncalled on to deprecate criticism by labored explanations. Better\r\nabolish the navy and lower our pretensions.\r\n\r\nBut the fact seems to be that the rapidity of naval development has\r\nnot been properly appreciated, and it is after a long interval of\r\nindifference that, attention being at last centred on the subject,\r\nit is seen how rapid its strides have been, and how utterly we\r\nare distanced in the race. There is evidently now in the country\r\na growing desire to repair the effects of the past oversight, and\r\nwe see Congress has moved in the matter. As all political parties\r\nnow unite in the necessity of effort in this direction, the hope is\r\ninspired that the subject is to be separated from those of a partisan\r\ncharacter, and that the rehabilitation of the navy will be put on\r\nits proper level, and accepted as a national question in which all\r\nare alike interested.\r\n\r\nPossessed as we are now of a navy such as has been indicated, the\r\nchange that was instituted involved a most violent transition. In\r\nreviewing our work of construction for over thirty years we saw\r\nno new type of cruiser. The only types of ships that we produced\r\nwere those that date before the war; since which we but reproduced\r\nthe same in classes of differing dimensions. From the sailing-ship\r\nwith auxiliary steam-power we passed to the steamer with auxiliary\r\nsail-power; but we had no full-powered steamers, with or without\r\nsails. As long as it was considered necessary to spread as much\r\ncanvas as was used, the space assigned to boilers and engines was\r\nlimited, and we failed to achieve full power; and a reduction to the\r\nminimum of sail-power had to be accepted before we could present a\r\ntype of a full-powered steamer.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two vessels of the _Alert_ class built of\r\niron, we had nothing but wooden hulls. We had continued to build in\r\nperishable material, requiring large sums to be spent in repairs, and\r\nignoring the manufactures of the country which could have been aided\r\nin their development by the contrary course. We permitted the age of\r\nsteel to reach its zenith without indicating that we were aware of\r\nits presence.\r\n\r\nIn these ships, with the exception of a few converted rifles of\r\n8-inch calibre, our armaments consist of smooth-bore cast-iron guns\r\nwhich have composed our batteries for thirty years. These are now to\r\nbe discarded, and their places to be filled with modern steel cannons.\r\n\r\nTorpedoes, movable torpedoes, of which we know nothing practically,\r\nare to be brought to the front, and are to form part of our\r\nequipment. Torpedo-boats are to be brought into use, and details\r\ninnumerable are now to be studied and worked out.\r\n\r\nConceive, then, a high-powered steamer with a minimum of canvas,\r\nbuilt of steel, armed with modern steel artillery, and a secondary\r\nbattery of Hotchkiss guns, fitted for launching movable torpedoes,\r\nwith protective deck over boilers and engines, divided into many\r\nwater-tight compartments giving protection to buoyancy, and compare\r\nsuch a ship with the old type of the United States cruiser, and\r\nan idea may be formed of the violence of the transition through\r\nwhich we had to pass. And there was nothing intermediate to break\r\nthe suddenness of this change; there was no connecting link. The\r\nstructure of to-day was placed in direct contrast with that of\r\ntwenty-five years ago. This is the position in which we stood, and we\r\ncould only accept a situation from which there was no escape.\r\n\r\nFrom all appearances the navy is now to be given an opportunity of\r\nasserting itself, and the steps already taken to remedy the existing\r\nstate of things can be stated in a few words.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the effort dates from June, 1881, when the first\r\nAdvisory Board was appointed to consider and to report on the need\r\nof appropriate vessels for the navy. This Board, in its report of\r\nNovember 7, 1881, decided that the United States navy should consist\r\nof seventy unarmored cruisers of steel; it reported that there were\r\nthirty-two vessels in the navy fit for service as cruisers, and it\r\nindicated the character of the new vessels to be built. This Board\r\nconfined itself to the consideration of unarmored vessels, as it did\r\nnot consider that the orders under which it acted required that it\r\nshould discuss the subject of armored ships, though it expressed the\r\nopinion that such vessels were indispensable in time of war.\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed before any practical results followed from the\r\naction of this Board, but in an act of Congress approved March 3,\r\n1883, the construction of three steam-cruisers and a despatch-boat\r\nwas authorized. These vessels, the _Chicago_, _Boston_, _Atlanta_,\r\nand _Dolphin_, are, with the exception of the _Chicago_, now in\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nIn an act of Congress approved March, 1885, five additional vessels\r\nwere authorized, and these, the _Charleston_, _Baltimore_, _Newark_,\r\nand gun-boats No. 1 and 2, are under construction.[49]\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the inception of these cruisers no steel for\r\nship-plates had been rolled in the United States. Construction in\r\nAmerican iron plates had been extensively carried on, but if steel\r\nplating was required it had to be imported at great cost to the\r\nbuilder. Those who contemplated bidding on the proposals issued\r\nby the government for the first four vessels had to consider this\r\nmatter. Mr. John Roach, of New York and of Chester, Pennsylvania,\r\nundertook the manufacture of this material, and finding that success\r\nattended his experiment, he was able to direct extensively the\r\nsteel-works at Thurlow, Pennsylvania, to this line of business,\r\nand when the bids were opened it was found that this new industry,\r\nintroduced through his enterprise, enabled him to underbid all\r\ncompetitors. After receiving the contracts for the ships, Mr. Roach\r\ncontracted with the Phœnix Iron Company, of Phœnixville, with Messrs.\r\nPark Brothers, of Pittsburgh, and the Norway Iron and Steel Works, of\r\nSouth Boston, for supplies of similar material: thus the first step\r\nin this effort to rehabilitate the navy resulted in introducing a\r\nnew industry into the country. The still more extensive development\r\nof industries that will attend the work of rehabilitation as it\r\nadvances will be treated further on.\r\n\r\nBefore presenting the types of cruisers which are now to be\r\nintroduced into the navy, it may be well to refer to an error that\r\nexists, or has existed, in the popular mind as to the signification\r\nof a steel cruiser. To many who are uninformed in technical language\r\nthe word steel, in connection with a vessel of war, implies\r\nprotecting armor, and such misapprehension would convey the idea that\r\na cruiser of steel is able to contend with an armored vessel. This\r\nis a mistake; there is protection obtained by constructing a vessel\r\nof steel, but not such as is provided by armor. The destructive\r\neffect of shell-firing and the development in modern artillery have\r\nmade armor necessary for all vessels which can carry it, and has\r\nalso made it necessary to provide all other protection possible to\r\nvessels that cannot carry armor. Although this protection cannot be\r\ngiven absolutely to the hull of such ships and to the _personnel_,\r\nit is provided to the _buoyancy_ by the introduction of water-tight\r\ncompartments and protective decks, which limit the destructive effect\r\nof the fire of the enemy and localize the water that may enter\r\nthrough shot-holes. With a wooden hull it would not be possible to\r\ncombine this precaution because of the difficulty in making joints\r\nwater-tight between wood and metal, and in consequence of the weight\r\nthat would be added to a wooden hull, which is already from sixteen\r\nper cent. to twenty per cent. heavier than if constructed of steel.\r\nThe only defensive advantage possessed by a steel unarmored cruiser\r\nover a wooden one is derived from this system of construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. FRIGATE “CHICAGO” (STEEL).]\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago_ is a steam-frigate, built throughout of steel of\r\ndomestic manufacture, the outside plating being 9/16 inch thick. Her\r\nlength is 325 feet, beam 48.2 feet, draught of water 19 feet. She has\r\na displacement of 4500 tons, and will attain a minimum speed of 14\r\nknots per hour with an indicated horse-power of 5000. The capacity\r\nof her coal-bunkers is 940 tons, and she carries a battery of four\r\n8-inch steel breech-loading guns in half-turrets, and eight 6-inch\r\nand two 5-inch steel breech-loaders on the gun-deck. This ship\r\nhas nine athwartships bulkheads, dividing the hull into ten main\r\nwater-tight compartments, and the machinery and boilers are covered\r\nby a protective deck one and a half inches in thickness. When the\r\nbunkers are full of coal she has a coal protection nine feet thick\r\nfrom the water-line to eight feet above it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DECK PLANS OF THE U. S. FRIGATE “CHICAGO,” SHOWING\r\nBATTERY.]\r\n\r\nThe deck plans show the arrangement of the main battery, in\r\naddition to which she carries a powerful secondary battery of\r\nHotchkiss rapid-firing single-shot, and revolving cannons and Gatling\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nThe bow of the vessel is strengthened for using the ram with which\r\nshe is fitted. The rudder and steering-gear are under water. She has\r\ntwo screws—a subdivision of power which is given to all ships-of-war\r\nof over 3000 tons displacement—from which a great advantage is\r\nderived if one engine is broken down, as three-fourths of the speed\r\ncan be maintained with the other. The advantage of this in a naval\r\naction is obvious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “ATLANTA” (STEEL).]\r\n\r\nThe _Atlanta_, of which the _Boston_ is a counterpart, presents\r\nanother type of a steel unarmored cruiser. She is a steam-corvette,\r\nor sloop-of-war, a single-decked ship. Her length is 276 feet, beam\r\n42 feet, draught of water 16 feet 10 inches. She has a displacement\r\nof 3000 tons, and has attained a speed of 15.5 knots per hour with a\r\nmaximum horse-power of 3482. The capacity of her coal-bunkers is 580\r\ntons, and her battery consists of two 8-inch steel breech-loading\r\nguns and six 6-inch, besides a secondary battery of Hotchkiss and\r\nGatling guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DECK PLAN OF THE U. S. SLOOP-OF-WAR “ATLANTA,” SHOWING\r\nBATTERY.]\r\n\r\nIn vessels of this class it is usual to have an open-deck battery,\r\nwith a poop-deck and top-gallant forecastle at the extremities, but\r\nthe effort has been made in this type to increase the effectiveness\r\nof the battery by giving the guns a more extended lateral train than\r\nis possible when a ship is arranged with a forecastle and poop-deck.\r\nThese, with the accommodations which they provide, have been removed\r\nfrom the ends of the ship, and a superstructure has been erected\r\namidships. This arrangement gives a clear sweep forward and aft\r\nfor the powerful 8-inch guns, enabling the forward gun to cover an\r\nall-around fire of from 40° abaft the beam on the port side to 30°\r\nabaft the beam on the starboard side, the after 8-inch gun having\r\na corresponding lateral sweep aft. Within the superstructure are\r\nmounted the six 6-inch guns, two on each side on the broadside, with\r\na train of 60° before and abaft the beam, the other two being mounted\r\nat diagonally opposite corners in such a way as to admit of their use\r\neither on the broadside or for fire ahead or astern. This object is\r\nachieved by mounting the two 8-inch guns _en échelon_, the forward\r\ngun being on the port side of the centre line of the ship, and the\r\nafter 8-inch gun on the starboard side of the same line. This is\r\nshown on the deck plan.[50]\r\n\r\nIt does not require the discrimination of a professional eye to see\r\nthe increased power given to the battery by this arrangement. It is\r\nan innovation that was very startling to the conservative mind; but\r\nthe more familiar the idea becomes, the more favorable opinion grows\r\nto the change, and the more apparent becomes the increased offensive\r\npower of the ship. The extremities of this type of ship will not,\r\nof course, be so dry in heavy weather as if it had a forecastle and\r\npoop, but it must be remembered that every part of the spar-deck is\r\nfrom nine to ten feet above the water. The rig of the _Atlanta_ is\r\nthat of a brig, but without head-booms; the fire ahead of the forward\r\nguns is thus unobstructed, and the ram with which she is fitted is\r\nalways clear for use. The division of the hull into water-tight\r\ncompartments by athwartship bulkheads, and a protective deck over\r\nengines and boilers, form a part of the construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. DESPATCH-BOAT “DOLPHIN.”]\r\n\r\nThe _Dolphin_, though not regarded as a vessel for fighting\r\npurposes, is the type of a class that is needed in all navies for\r\nduty as a despatch-boat, or for the temporary accommodation of a\r\ncommander-in-chief of a squadron who may desire to communicate\r\nrapidly with his ships at distant points. She is well fitted for\r\nthe service, and is now in commission, demonstrating her ability to\r\nperform the work required of her. She could also be of service as a\r\ncommerce destroyer, for which service she is equipped with one gun of\r\nlong range. Her length is 240 feet, beam 32 feet, draught of water\r\n14.25 feet. She has a displacement of 1485 tons, and attains a speed\r\nof 15 knots per hour.\r\n\r\nHer advent into the navy marks an epoch—the inauguration of the\r\nsuccessful manufacture in the United States of American rolled steel\r\nship-plating, equal to the best in the world, as shown by the most\r\nrigid government tests. The _Dolphin_, is the first vessel, whether\r\nfor naval or commercial purposes, that is built entirely of steel\r\nof domestic manufacture, and is the pioneer representative of other\r\nsimilar industries which will be developed as the rehabilitation of\r\nthe navy proceeds. She has proved herself eminently successful, and\r\nis the fastest sea-steamer of her displacement built in the United\r\nStates, with perhaps the exception of the steam-yacht _Atalanta_. She\r\nis a stanch vessel of great structural strength, and does credit to\r\nthe ship-building profession of the country.\r\n\r\nOf the additional cruisers authorized by the late acts of Congress,\r\nparticulars will be found in the Notes.\r\n\r\nIn one of the larger vessels the type of the _Atlanta_ will be\r\nreproduced on a larger scale, while the other vessel of the same\r\nclass will be provided with a poop and top-gallant forecastle, and\r\nwill carry her forward and after guns on sponsons, by which means\r\nfire ahead and astern will be secured. This will make it necessary to\r\nlimit the power of the battery of the second vessel to 6-inch guns,\r\nas the 8-inch gun cannot conveniently be carried on sponsons in a\r\nvessel of 4000 tons displacement.\r\n\r\nThe heavy gun-boat will carry six 6-inch guns, the forward and after\r\nones on sponsons; and the light gun-boat will carry four of the same\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of these additional vessels advantage has been\r\ntaken of all our experience in our initial effort, and of whatever\r\ndevelopments may have been made by others since the earlier vessels\r\nwere designed.\r\n\r\nThe absolute departure from the old standards is apparent in\r\nmaterial, in armament, in speed, and in rig.\r\n\r\nThe causes that have led to this change in material may be found,\r\nfirst, in the change that has taken place in ordnance. The\r\nintroduction of the rifled cannon, and its subsequent development,\r\nhave increased very much the weight of this part of the equipment of\r\na vessel-of-war, and the necessity of accommodating the stowage of\r\ncharges of powder much increased in size, and of ammunition for the\r\nsecondary batteries, which must be most liberally supplied, makes\r\nan absolute demand on an increased portion of space. Again, the\r\nincreased speed now considered indispensable makes a similar demand\r\nfor space, and carries with it as well an increased proportion of\r\nthe total displacement. In a wooden hull it would be impossible to\r\nreconcile these demands, in consequence of the weight of the hull\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe hull and hull fittings of an unarmored cruiser built of wood will\r\nweigh from 49 per cent. to 52 per cent. of the total displacement.\r\nWith high-powered engines it is doubtful if sufficient strength can\r\nbe obtained with even 52 per cent. of the displacement for the hull,\r\nand this must suppose the absence of all protection to buoyancy, as\r\nwater-tight compartments.\r\n\r\nThe hull and fittings of a steel cruiser, exclusive of protective\r\ndecks, will weigh from 39 per cent. to 44 per cent. of the total\r\ndisplacement.\r\n\r\nSuppose a 4500-ton ship built of wood weighing 50 per cent. of the\r\ntotal displacement, and the same ship built of steel weighing 40 per\r\ncent. of the total displacement, the respective weights of the hulls\r\nwill be 2250 tons and 1800 tons, a difference of 450 tons, the steel\r\nhull being one-fifth, or 20 per cent., lighter than the wooden one.\r\nThis will allow for increased weight of ordnance, protective deck,\r\nor increased coal endurance, as may be decided when considering the\r\nservice on which the ship is to be employed.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the saving thus obtained, the question of weights\r\nis still full of difficulties and embarrassments, and it is found\r\nimpossible in the same structure to accommodate all demands from the\r\ndifferent departments concerned in the equipment of a vessel-of-war.\r\nThe sail-power has been reduced, so as to save weight of spars and\r\nsails, which have become of secondary importance, but this will not\r\nsatisfy all the requirements of the problem. As articles appertaining\r\nto the old method of equipment are removed, those belonging to what\r\nare considered necessary under the new order of things are brought\r\nforward. Space is still to be found for movable torpedoes, for\r\ntorpedo-boats, and for engines and appurtenances for electrical\r\napparatus for lighting the ship, for search-light, and other ordnance\r\npurposes. It is evident that much study is needed to reduce weights\r\nin all the essential parts, so as to be able to accommodate all the\r\ndevices which the progress of ideas continues to present. Much is yet\r\nto be done by the substitution of steel for iron in many parts of our\r\nengines, and experiments abroad lead to the hope that the weights of\r\nboilers may be much reduced, but as the question stands to-day it is\r\nimpossible to provide any single ship with all the appliances that\r\nare considered necessary for a perfectly equipped vessel-of-war.\r\nEvery ship, therefore, must present a compromise.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the transition from wood to steel hulls is\r\nthe durability of steel as compared with wood. Referring to the\r\nlarge sums of money that have been appropriated under the head of\r\nconstruction and repairs, for which there is now so little to show\r\n(and disregarding the question of administration, which of course\r\nis vital, but which has no place in this chapter), the main reason\r\nfor the deficiency in the results is that all this money has been\r\nexpended in perishable material. Every ship that has been built\r\nof wood since the war has been a mistake. The most serious error\r\nwas committed when the wooden double-turreted Monitors of the\r\n_Miantonomoh_ class were built, which, it is believed, was done\r\nagainst the protest of Captain Ericsson. The result was the early\r\ndecay of these vessels, and the present defenceless condition of\r\nour sea-coast. The lifetime of a wooden ship is of short duration.\r\nIt requires constant repairs, which amount in the long-run to\r\nrebuilding, and it is in this manner that so many of our old ships\r\nare still retained in service; but in the case of a wooden armored\r\nvessel these repairs are impossible without removing the armor. This\r\nwas the condition of affairs with regard to these Monitors, and the\r\nconsequence is that the country has to incur the expense of entirely\r\nnew constructions. These are in durable material, and will give good\r\naccount of themselves when called on.\r\n\r\nThe steel hulls that it is now the intention shall compose the fleet,\r\nwill, if well cared for, endure in perfect condition for thirty\r\nyears. In fact, the lifetime of an iron or steel hull is not defined\r\nto any limit, and if a perfect anti-corrosive and anti-fouling\r\ncomposition can be produced, the limit may be regarded as indefinite.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks on our new navy apply to unarmored cruisers,\r\na class of ships which supply a want in time of peace, but cannot\r\nfulfil the purposes of war. At such a time the armored ship is\r\nrecognized as indispensable, and there is every reason why the\r\nconstruction of armored vessels should proceed simultaneously with\r\nthat of the unarmored cruisers. These are a more intricate problem\r\nfor study, need much more time to build, and are required, while at\r\npeace, as a school of instruction in which to prepare for war. Our\r\nselection of armor has been much assisted by the investigations of\r\nothers, and we are in a favorable condition to make a decision on\r\nthis point; and the type of vessel best suited for a cruiser seems to\r\nbe settled, by the uniform practice of foreign nations, in favor of\r\nthe barbette.[51]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that six months since we were not\r\nin a condition to proceed with the construction of armored vessels,\r\ndepending on our own resources. We had to go abroad to purchase\r\narmor, or set ourselves to the task of establishing works where it\r\ncould be manufactured. The establishment of these plants was the\r\nfirst thing needful, and until this was done it was impossible to\r\nmake ourselves independent in this matter. The construction of our\r\nfirst unarmored cruisers introduced into the country the industry of\r\nrolling steel ship-plates; the construction of our new ordnance and\r\narmored ships has, in turn, introduced the new industries of casting\r\nand forging large masses of war material.\r\n\r\nThis subject, so far as it relates to ordnance, was referred to a\r\nmixed board of army and navy officers, known as the Gun Foundery\r\nBoard; this, with the aid and counsel of some of the ablest and\r\nleading steel manufacturers in the United States, submitted to\r\nCongress a report which presented a solution of the problem, and\r\ndemonstrated on what terms the steel manufacturers of the country\r\ncould be induced to work in accord with the government. The Board had\r\nunder consideration only the subject of founderies and factories for\r\ngun construction, but the casting and forging facilities required\r\nfor guns could be applicable to armor; thus in providing means for\r\nthe manufacture of one, the other purpose was equally subserved.\r\n\r\nWith material of domestic manufacture at hand, it will be the duty\r\nof the government to provide the navy with a fleet of ten armored\r\ncruisers of the most approved type. These vessels would form the\r\nouter line of defence of the coast during war, and should be of such\r\nforce as to be able to contend with any second-class armored vessel\r\nof other nations. Some of them should be always in commission during\r\ntimes of peace, if only for instruction and practice purposes, and\r\none should be assigned to each squadron abroad to carry the flag of\r\nthe rear-admiral in command, to assert our position in the society of\r\nnaval powers, able to give substantial “support to American policy in\r\nmatters where foreign governments are concerned.”\r\n\r\nThe ability to contend with armored vessels of the first class\r\nmust be reserved for another type of ships, which are styled\r\n“coast-defence vessels,” and without which our new navy will not be\r\nthoroughly equipped for contributing its full share to defence at\r\nhome. In considering armored vessels, what was said before as to the\r\ncharacter of compromise that obtains in vessels-of-war must be borne\r\nin mind. All desirable features cannot be concentrated in any one\r\nship; the special duty for which the vessel is to be used controls\r\nthe selection. The sea-going armored cruiser is expected to keep the\r\nsea for a lengthened period: she must have large coal endurance. She\r\nmay be called on to sustain more than one engagement: her supply of\r\nammunition must be large. Her speed must equal that of the fastest\r\nsea-going vessels of similar type to enable her to pursue an equal or\r\nto avoid a superior force: hence much space and displacement must be\r\nassigned to engines and boilers. Thus the amount of her armor and the\r\nweight of her battery are affected by these other demands, which are\r\nthe more imperative.\r\n\r\nIn the case of coast-defence vessels the conditions are changed,\r\nenabling in them the full development of both offensive and defensive\r\nproperties. These vessels are assigned to duty on the coast: they\r\nmust be as fit to keep the sea as are the armored cruisers, and they\r\nmust be able to fight their guns in all weathers that the armored\r\ncruiser can fight; but as they do not require the coal endurance nor\r\nthe speed of the ship that is to keep the sea for lengthened periods,\r\nthe weight saved in coal and machinery can be utilized in battery and\r\narmor. Such vessels constitute the main line of naval defence, as\r\nthey can be made almost absolutely invulnerable and irresistible.\r\n\r\nUnder an act of a late Congress a board on “fortifications and other\r\ndefences” was occupied in considering the defences of the coast,\r\nand there were recommended by this Board two classes of “floating\r\nbatteries” (so called), coast-defence vessels, and one class of low\r\nfreeboard vessels for harbor defence. An examination of the designs\r\nof these vessels shows that they are replete with merit, and present\r\nsome novel and valuable features. A justifiable limitation is put\r\non the coal endurance and speed, though fair speed is secured;\r\nand altogether the plans prove there can be designed vessels of\r\ncomparatively small dimensions, light draught, great handiness and\r\nmanœuvring power, which can carry the heaviest guns, and be capable\r\nof contending on equal terms with the heaviest European battle-ships.\r\nThe cut below represents the smaller of the type of coast-defence\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIGHT DRAUGHT COAST-DEFENCE VESSEL, WITH DECK PLAN.]\r\n\r\nThe largest class will be armed with two 107-ton guns in a turret,\r\nand two 26-ton guns in a barbette. The thickness of armor will vary\r\nfrom 16 to 18 inches.\r\n\r\nThe second class will be armed with two 75-ton guns in a turret, and\r\ntwo 26-ton guns in a barbette. The thickness of armor will be from 11\r\nto 16 inches.\r\n\r\nThe smallest vessels, for harbor defence, modified Monitors, will\r\nbe armed with two 44-ton guns in a turret, and two 26-ton guns in a\r\nbarbette. The thickness of armor will be from 10 to 13 inches.\r\n\r\nA fleet composed of such vessels as are represented in the largest\r\ntype would be able to engage an enemy at some distance from the\r\ncoast—an important object in these days when the range of heavy\r\nrifled cannons makes it possible to shell towns from a great\r\ndistance, and at points remote from shore batteries.\r\n\r\nNominally we have now a fleet of vessels for coast defence, the old\r\nwar Monitors of the _Passaic_ class; but the contrast between them\r\nand the vessels recommended by the Fortifications Board is about\r\nequal in degree with that between our wooden fleet and the new steel\r\ncruisers.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that a movable automatic torpedo shall be utilized by\r\nall armored vessels, either by means of a torpedo-boat to be carried\r\nby armored cruisers, or by the vessel itself in the case of coast and\r\nharbor defence ships.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo that has mainly succeeded thus far in recommending itself\r\nto the naval powers is that invented by Mr. Whitehead. Numerous\r\nefforts have been made by others in this field, but the difficulties\r\nthat surround it are made very apparent by the paucity of the\r\nresults. It will be understood that the torpedo, when launched, is\r\nleft entirely to automatic control; hence, apart from the motive\r\npower, it is necessary that it shall possess directive power,\r\nvertically to control immersion and horizontally to control direction\r\nin the horizontal plane. In the Whitehead torpedo the immersion is\r\nwell regulated, and if no deflecting influences are encountered, the\r\ndirection is also preserved; but it fails where deflecting influences\r\nintervene. During the Turko-Russian war valuable experience was\r\ngained, and instances are known where the torpedo failed to operate\r\nfrom want of directive power. An instance is cited where a torpedo\r\nwas deflected by striking the chain of a vessel at anchor, causing it\r\nto pass harmlessly to one side. Another instance is cited where the\r\ntorpedo was deflected from the side of a ship owing to the angle at\r\nwhich it struck. It is evident that perfection cannot be associated\r\nwith a weapon of this class that has not a strong directive force\r\ninherent in it.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo invented by Captain J. A. Howell, of the United States\r\nnavy, possesses this property to an eminent degree, and it is\r\nregarded by most competent experts as the successful rival of the\r\nWhitehead. In the Howell torpedo the power is stored in a fly-wheel\r\nrevolving with great rapidity in a longitudinal vertical plane,\r\nand its gyroscopic tendency makes it impossible for the torpedo to\r\ndeviate from its original course in a horizontal plane; the principle\r\nis the same as insures the accuracy of the rifle-bullet, enabling\r\nit to resist deflecting influences. The latest experiments of\r\nCaptain Howell in controlling the immersion of his torpedo were very\r\nsuccessful, and it is probable that the auto-mobile torpedo for our\r\nnew navy will be an American invention. Liberality in experiments is\r\nindispensable in perfecting a device of this kind; it is to be hoped\r\nthat such may be extended to the Howell torpedo.[52]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOWELL TORPEDO.\r\n\r\n_B_, fly-wheel. _C_, _C_, screw propellers. _D_, diving rudder.\r\n_E_, _E_, steering rudders. _F_, water-chamber containing automatic\r\napparatus. _G_, firing pin. _H_, position of gun-cotton magazine.]\r\n\r\nThe general reader is probably not aware of the effect on naval\r\nwarfare produced by the introduction of the auto-mobile torpedo,\r\naffecting the constituents of the fleet itself. Formerly a fleet\r\nconsisted of battle-ships alone, or with store-ships to provide\r\nconsumable articles; to these were later added despatch-boats for\r\nthe service indicated by their title; but since the introduction\r\nof the torpedo an additional fleet of torpedo-boats is considered\r\nnecessary for the protection of the battle-ships. All armored ships\r\nare expected to carry at least one torpedo-boat, which is designed\r\nfor operating against the enemy during an action at sea, and the\r\nuniversal adoption of this practice has led to the introduction\r\ninto fleets of a new type of vessel called torpedo-boat catchers,\r\nwhose primary duty it is to destroy the torpedo-boats of the enemy.\r\nFor this purpose these vessels have phenomenal speed, and besides\r\ntheir equipment of auto-mobile torpedoes, are provided with powerful\r\nbatteries of single-shot and revolving Hotchkiss guns, capable of\r\npenetrating all parts of a torpedo-boat. This type of vessel is now\r\nbeing tested by the English and the Continental governments, and\r\nforms one of the constituents of their fleets.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo-boat is undoubtedly one of the features that should be\r\nintroduced into our new navy, not only for their possible use on the\r\nhigh seas, but for the purpose of supplementing the harbor-defence\r\nvessels, while the type of vessel known as the torpedo-boat catcher\r\nwould be a powerful auxiliary to the armored cruisers on the first\r\nline, or the more powerful vessels forming the second line of the\r\ncoast defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the new navy of the United States Congress has authorized the\r\nconstruction of twenty-five vessels, of which seven will be armored,\r\nsixteen unarmored, and two “such floating batteries, rams, or other\r\nnaval structures for coast defence” as may be determined by the\r\nNavy Department. This list embraces five double-turreted Monitors,\r\none armored battle-ship, one armored cruiser, eight partially\r\nprotected cruisers, one dynamite-gun cruiser, four gun-boats, one\r\ndespatch-vessel, and two torpedo-boats. Of the twenty vessels already\r\nbuilt or ordered but three are in commission. They vary so much in\r\ntype that the following conventional data may perhaps be of some use\r\n(see table on the following page), though it must be remembered that\r\nthe performances stated are theoretical, except in the cases of the\r\n_Atlanta_, _Boston_, and _Dolphin_.\r\n\r\nThe defects found in the _Atlanta_ when first tested were so easily\r\nremedied that the machinery finally developed a maximum horse-power\r\nwhich was only a little less than that required by the contract;\r\nwhile the _Boston_ reached a maximum of 4248.5 horse-power. In his\r\nlast report to the President the Secretary of the Navy said:\r\n\r\n“The _Dolphin_ and the _Atlanta_ having both been completed, and\r\nhaving had trial trips, it is possible to compare them in their\r\nresults with similar vessels built contemporaneously elsewhere.\r\nThe _Dolphin_, of 1500 tons displacement, can be compared with\r\nthe _Alacrity_ and _Surprise_, English despatch-vessels of 1400\r\ntons each, and the _Milan_, a French despatch-vessel of 1550 tons,\r\nall built contemporaneously. The _Dolphin_ was designed for 2300\r\nindicated horse-power, the _Alacrity_ and _Surprise_ each 3000,\r\nand the _Milan_ 3900. The highest mean horse-power developed upon\r\ntrial was, in the case of the _Dolphin_, less than 2200; of the\r\n_Alacrity_, 3173; of the _Surprise_, 3079; of the _Milan_, 4132. The\r\nhighest speed of the _Dolphin_, resulting from several trials, was\r\n15.11 knots, running light; of the _Alacrity_, 17.95 knots; of the\r\n_Surprise_, 17.8 knots; of the _Milan_, 18.4 knots.\r\n\r\n“The _Atlanta_, the sister ship to the _Boston_, can be compared\r\nwith the _Esmeralda_, the _Giovanni Bausan_, and the _Mersey_. All\r\nthree were built in England: the _Esmeralda_ for Chili, the _Giovanni\r\nBausan_ for Italy, and the _Mersey_ for the English government. The\r\n_Atlanta_ is of 3000 tons displacement; the _Esmeralda_, 2920; the\r\n_Giovanni Bausan_, 3086; and the _Mersey_, 3550. The _Atlanta_ was\r\ndesigned to attain an indicated horse-power of 3500, the _Esmeralda_\r\nand the _Giovanni Bausan_ each 5500, and the _Mersey_ 6000. The\r\ntrials had of the _Atlanta_ indicate that her engines will develop\r\nless than 3500 horse-power, while the _Esmeralda_ developed 6000,\r\nthe _Giovanni Bausan_ 6680, and the _Mersey_ 6626.

Leaving out of consideration the\r\ndouble-turreted Monitors, the additions to the fleet have been the\r\ncruisers _Charleston_ and _Baltimore_, the No. 1 and 2 gun-boats,\r\nthe cruiser _Newark_, the two armored vessels, the torpedo-boat,\r\nthe dynamite cruiser, the No. 4 and 5 cruisers, the No. 3 and 4\r\ngun-boats of No. 1 type, and the floating batteries. The _Stiletto_,\r\nif accepted, will be bought from the Herreshoff Company; all the\r\nrest, except the battle-ship, are to be or have been constructed by\r\ncontract in private yards. Of the new ones the _Charleston_ and No. 5\r\ncruiser will be built at San Francisco; gun-boat No. 2 at Baltimore;\r\nthe dynamite cruiser, gun-boat No. 1, the _Baltimore_, _Newark_, and\r\ncruiser No. 4, at Philadelphia, and gun-boats Nos. 3 and 4 at New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe steel partially protected cruiser _Charleston_ is, except in\r\ndetails of internal accommodations, a duplicate of the _Naniwa-Kan_,\r\nwhich was in turn a progressive development of the type-making\r\n_Esmeralda_, inasmuch as she has greater speed, more powerful\r\narmament, and superior protection to stability. The plans of the\r\n_Charleston_ were bought abroad simply because they could not be\r\nmade here; and notwithstanding the twopenny-ha’penny criticisms this\r\naction evoked, its wisdom has been justified. The _Charleston_ has\r\nneither poop nor forecastle, and the unhampered ends give in action\r\nperfect freedom of fire for two 10-inch guns, which are mounted in\r\nlow, thin-plated barbettes, situated on the ship’s middle line, at\r\na distance of sixty feet from the bow and stern respectively. These\r\npieces are without armor protection, except that offered against\r\nmachine-gun fire by a two-inch segmental shield. Between these\r\nheavy guns a high waist stretches amidships, in which six 6-inch\r\nbreech-loaders are mounted on sponsons or in projecting turrets.\r\nThe secondary battery includes two 6-pounder rapid-fire guns, eight\r\nmachine guns, and four above-water torpedo-tubes. The 10-inch guns\r\nmust always be brought back to the fore-and-aft line for reloading,\r\nand their ammunition is passed through steel tubes which extend below\r\nthe protective deck. The engines are double-compound, situated in\r\nseparate compartments, and in the _Naniwa-Kan_ the type developed\r\n7650 horse-power and 18.9 knots.\r\n\r\nIn the twin-screw cruiser _Baltimore_ a longitudinal water-tight\r\nbulkhead joins the double bottom, which runs under the engine and\r\nboilers to a protective deck that extends the whole length of the\r\nship, and is three inches thick on the flat top and four inches\r\nthick on the sloping sides. The machinery consists of a pair of\r\ntriple-expansion compound engines which are to develop 18 knots and\r\n7500 horse-power with natural, and 19½ knots and 10,750 horse-power\r\nwith forced, draft. There are two separate engine-rooms and two\r\nboiler-rooms, and the normal coal capacity of 600 tons will be\r\nsufficient for 1800 knots. Additional space is provided for 300 tons\r\nmore, and with this total there ought to be an endurance of 8000\r\nmiles at 11 knots, and of 14,000 miles, or 75 days’ steaming, at 8\r\nknots. No sails except storm-sails will be provided. The _Baltimore_\r\nis to have a poop and forecastle, on which four 8-inch guns with\r\ndirect fore-and-aft fire will be mounted. On the main deck six 6-inch\r\nguns will be carried in broadside, and the secondary battery and\r\ntorpedo-tubes are effective and well disposed.\r\n\r\nThe maximum price fixed at first by Congress for the _Newark_ was\r\nless than any of the bids received, but at the last session the\r\nappropriation was increased to $1,300,000, and the contract was\r\nawarded in August of this year. The _Newark_ is a bark-rigged,\r\ntwin-screw cruiser of 4083 tons displacement. A double bottom extends\r\nthrough 129 feet of her length, and a protective deck, which rises\r\nfifteen inches above the water-line amidships, runs uninterruptedly\r\nfore and aft. Four feet above this the berth-deck is built, the\r\nintermediate space being greatly subdivided and utilized for stores.\r\nNumerous water-tight frames are worked in the double bottom, and\r\nwherever practicable the cellular construction is employed. The\r\nengines are to develop 6000 horse-power with natural draft, and\r\n8500 horse-power and a maximum speed of eighteen knots with forced\r\ndraft. This vessel has a poop and forecastle, and the guns are\r\ncarried on the upper deck. The main battery consists of twelve\r\n6-inch centre-pivot guns, furnished with segmental shields, and\r\nmounted on sponsons so as to obtain the greatest arc of fire; the\r\ntwo guns nearest the bow and stern converge their fire at a point\r\n400 feet distant from the ends of the ship, and those in broadside\r\ncan be concentrated within 100 feet of the ship. In addition to\r\nthe secondary battery given in the table, there are six above-water\r\ntorpedo-tubes.\r\n\r\nThe development of naval construction cannot be proved more\r\nconclusively than by comparing the new cruisers with those which\r\nwere first laid down. In the _Atlanta_, for example, the builder\r\nguaranteed that 664 tons of machinery would produce 3500 indicated\r\nhorse-power; but the _Charleston_ must, before acceptance, develop\r\n7000 horse-power for 710 tons of machinery; that is to say, the\r\nenergy for weight has been doubled within four years.\r\n\r\nThe twin-screw gun-boat No. 1 is the prototype of a class that now\r\ninclude three vessels, and a very promising nucleus it is for a\r\nfleet to which the defence of the country’s coast must mainly be\r\nintrusted. The ship is to be built of steel, with a three and a half\r\ninch complete water-tight deck, so arched as to have a spring of\r\nabout three feet in its greatest width, and a crown that will nearly\r\nreach the water-line level. There is no double bottom, but the number\r\nof water-tight compartments is very great, and coffer-dams surround\r\nthe engine and fire-room hatches, and are carried to a height of\r\neighteen inches above the main deck. The complement numbers 150, and\r\nthe rig is that of a three-masted schooner, with a sail area of 4400\r\nsquare feet. The machinery is estimated to indicate 2200 horse-power\r\nwith natural draft, and 3300 with forced draft, and consists of two\r\nindependent compound engines placed in separate compartments. The\r\nspeed is given as sixteen knots, but it is probable this rate will be\r\nconsiderably exceeded. The main battery consists of six 6-inch guns,\r\nthe secondary of two 57-millimetre rapid-fire guns, two 37-millimetre\r\nrevolving cannons, and one short Gatling. Four of the 6-inch guns are\r\nmounted on the poop and forecastle—two forward, two aft—and the\r\nother pieces of this calibre are carried on sponsons amidships, so\r\nas to have a large arc of fire about the beam. The elevated guns are\r\neighteen feet above the low-water line, the centre ones ten feet, and\r\nall are mounted on central pivots and fitted with protective shields.\r\nThe torpedo armament is of great relative importance; of the eight\r\ntubes supplied, the stem and stern ones are fixed and fitted with\r\nunder-water discharge, while the other six can be trained, and are\r\ndistributed four forward and two aft. In gun-boat No. 2 the machinery\r\nis to develop 900 horse-power with natural, and 1350 with forced,\r\ndraft; the engines, boilers, and magazines are placed beneath a steel\r\ndeck three-eighths of an inch thick, which amidships is twenty-seven\r\ninches below the water-line at the edge and eight inches above at the\r\ncrown. The armament consists of four 6-inch sponson-mounted guns, two\r\n47-millimetre guns, two 37-millimetre revolving cannons, and one\r\nshort Gatling. She is barkentine rigged, with a plain sail area of\r\n4480 square feet, and has a slightly ram-shaped, cast-steel stem. The\r\ncomplement is 100.\r\n\r\nThe pneumatic-gun cruiser is to be armed with three of Zalinski’s\r\npneumatic dynamite guns of 10½-inch calibre, each of which is to\r\nthrow a shell containing 200 pounds of high explosives for a distance\r\nof one mile, and to be capable of being discharged at least once in\r\ntwo minutes. The guaranteed speed is twenty knots.\r\n\r\nUnder the law of August 3, 1881, authorizing the construction of\r\ntwo new ships, it was provided that these should be “sea-going,\r\ndouble-bottomed, armored vessels of about 6000 tons displacement,\r\ndesigned for a speed of at least sixteen knots an hour, with engines\r\nhaving all necessary appliances for working under forced draft, to\r\nhave a complete torpedo outfit, and be armed in the most effective\r\nmanner.” According to the circular issued by the Navy Department,\r\none of these was to be an armored cruiser, with a maximum draught\r\nof twenty-two feet, and the other a battle-ship, with a draught\r\nof twenty-three feet; both were to be built of steel, with double\r\nbottoms, to have numerous water-tight compartments fitted with\r\npowerful pumping apparatus, and to be supplied throughout with\r\nperfect drainage and ventilation. A ram bow, twin screws, electric\r\nsearch-lights, torpedo outfit, and a protected steel-armored deck\r\nrunning the whole length of the ship and covering the boilers,\r\nengines, and magazines, were essentials; while high power and economy\r\nwere so equally demanded that, to a maximum maintained speed of\r\nseventeen knots when fully equipped, great coal endurance and small\r\nfuel consumption were to be added. In each vessel a space sufficient\r\nfor two hundred and seventy people, for provisions for three months,\r\nand for water for one month, was required. The cruiser was to have\r\ntwo-thirds sail-power on two or three masts, each supplied with a\r\nmilitary top fitted to mount one or more machine guns. The armament\r\nof this ship was to include ten steel breech-loading rifles—four of\r\n10-inch and six of 6-inch calibre—and a secondary battery of four\r\n6-pounders, four 3-pounders, and two 1-pounders, rapid-fire, and four\r\n47-millimetre and four 37-millimetre revolving cannons, all of the\r\nHotchkiss pattern, together with four Gatling guns. There were to be\r\nfitted six torpedo-tubes—one bow, one stern, and two on each side,\r\nof which at least one on each side forward was to be under water.\r\nThe heavy guns were to load in not less than two positions, and were\r\nto be protected by at least ten and a half inches of steel armor,\r\nproperly backed; the 6-inch guns were to be fitted with shields,\r\nand all the guns were to be arranged so as to obtain the greatest\r\nhorizontal and vertical fire consistent with other conditions. Any\r\nvertical armored protection at the water-line was to be at least\r\neleven inches thick in the heaviest part, and thicker, if practicable.\r\n\r\nThe armament of the line-of-battle ship was to consist of two 12-inch\r\nand six 6-inch guns, and of a secondary battery which included four\r\n6-inch, six 3-pounder, and two 1-pounder rapid-fire guns; of four\r\n47-millimetre and four 37-millimetre revolving cannons, and of four\r\nGatlings. The torpedo outfit was similar to that of the cruiser.\r\n\r\nThe plans submitted were opened on April 1st of this year, and\r\nnotwithstanding the difficulties which the displacement imposed\r\nupon the other requirements, no less than thirteen designs were\r\nreceived from ten different competitors. The most important of\r\nthese were offered by the Thames Iron Ship Building Company and the\r\nBarrow Ship Building Company, of Great Britain; by A. H. Grandjean,\r\nEsq., of France; and by Chief Constructor Wilson, Naval Constructor\r\nPook, and Lieutenant Chambers, all of the United States navy. The\r\ndesigns were submitted to a board, and this finally recommended the\r\nBarrow plan as best suited for the armored battle-ship. So far as\r\nthe armored cruiser was concerned, the Board reported as follows:\r\n“The marked differences in the essential features of the designs of\r\narmored cruisers of the Barrow Ship Building Company, Lieutenant W.\r\nI. Chambers, A. H. Grandjean, and the Thames Iron-Works and Ship\r\nBuilding Company, prevent their classification in the order of merit.\r\nEach exhibits features which strongly commend themselves, but the\r\nBoard does not consider it advisable for the government to build a\r\nvessel upon any one of these plans.”\r\n\r\nThe battle-ship, though designed by one of the most distinguished\r\nmarine architects in England, has not in its present form received\r\nthe general approval of experts, for between it and the plan\r\nsubmitted by the Bureau of Construction there seem to be differences\r\nof merits which are strongly in favor of the latter. The dimensions\r\nof the new ships are as follows:\r\n\r\n  BARROW SHIP.\r\n\r\n  Length between perpendiculars, 290 feet; on load water-line, 300\r\n  feet; extreme breadth, 64 feet 1 inch; mean draught, 22 feet 6\r\n  inches; displacement, 6300 tons.\r\n\r\n  NAVY DEPARTMENT SHIP.\r\n\r\n  Length between perpendiculars, 300 feet; on load water-line,\r\n  310 feet; extreme breadth, 58 feet; mean draught, 22 feet;\r\n  displacement, 6600 tons.\r\n\r\nThe striking differences between these two ships are found in their\r\nrelative stability and sea-going qualities. Mr. John, the designer\r\nof the Barrow ship, in a paper on “Atlantic Steamers,” read before\r\nthe Institution of Naval Architects July 29, 1886, made the following\r\nstatements:\r\n\r\n“This question of stability will have to be carefully watched and\r\nstudied within the next few years, because there is a tendency at\r\npresent towards a rapid increase in the proportion of beam to length;\r\nand as the draught of water in these large ships is limited, we must\r\nbe careful that in seeking higher speeds with increased beam we do\r\nnot get too much stability, and so render the vessels heavy rollers\r\nand very uncomfortable as passenger-ships. It is possible the future\r\nmay see vessels of greater beam than any yet afloat in the merchant\r\nservice; but if so, it is almost inevitable that they will have to be\r\nmade higher out of water in order to render them easy and comfortable\r\nat sea, but even that has its limits. Perhaps it is well to give\r\nan extreme case, and here I will make use of our old friend _The\r\nGreat Eastern_.... Now, for the purpose of trading it is quite clear\r\nthat _The Great Eastern_ cannot be loaded much deeper than other\r\nships, while her beam is half as great again; and the consequence\r\nis, her stability, as compared with our modern passenger-ships, is\r\nso excessive that she is bound to be a tremendous roller among the\r\nheavy seas in the Atlantic. Her metacentric height, when loaded, was,\r\nI believe, stated by the late Mr. Froude to be as much as 8.7 feet,\r\nwhich is from three to four times as much as is thought sufficient\r\nfor ships in the present day, or consistent with their easy behavior\r\nat sea.”\r\n\r\nThus Mr. John himself regards 2.9 feet to 2.2 feet as the proper\r\nmetacentric height for those steamers, and it is generally considered\r\nby modern designers that from 2.5 to 3.2 feet is most suitable for\r\nthis class of armored ships, and is conducive to easiness of motion\r\nin a sea-way. The value of this quality to a ship intended for\r\nsea-fighting cannot be overestimated, for upon her steadiness as a\r\ngun-platform the aim and efficiency of her guns greatly depend.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that this ship has exceptionally great beam,\r\nthat of most ships of her class and displacement, varying from 54\r\nto 59 feet, and judging from the sketches which have appeared, her\r\nwater-line coefficient is about 0.72. From an approximate calculation\r\nbased on this assumption it is found that her metacentric height\r\nwill be about six feet. The water-line coefficient may possibly be\r\na little finer than 0.72, and thus reduce the metacentric height,\r\nbut if this ship is assumed to have a metacentric height of three\r\nfeet, her water-line coefficient would be 0.6288, which is an\r\n_impossibility_, if her coefficient of fineness of displacement\r\nbe that given in the published dimensions. Such a water-line and\r\ncoefficient of fineness for 6300 tons displacement would produce\r\na perfect rectangle for a midship section. So that, unless her\r\ndimensions are changed, she will surely be a heavy roller, and after\r\nmuch sea duty she will suffer such severe strains as to require\r\nfrequent and costly repairs.\r\n\r\nThe battle-ship designed at the Navy Department has very different\r\nqualities, if the dimensions already published be correct. To possess\r\na metacentric height of three feet she would require a water-line\r\ncoefficient of 0.753, and a midship-section coefficient of 0.89 to\r\n0.90, which is a good proportion for such a vessel. Not only in\r\nsea-going qualities does the American design seem to be superior,\r\nbut her battery is far more powerful and better disposed in every\r\nway, while her speed and endurance are equally as great as the plan\r\nrecommended. Mr. John has adopted the _échelon_ arrangement of heavy\r\nguns, a disposition which both the English and Italian governments\r\nhave, after long trial, discarded in their latest ships. When the\r\nfirst sketches of a design are made, this arrangement of guns is\r\ntheoretically perfect, as it is supposed to give quite as much power\r\nof fire ahead and astern as on each broadside; but when the design is\r\ndeveloped and practically tested, it is found that too much of the\r\nship’s efficiency in other respects is sacrificed, that the powerful\r\nend fire is not attained, and that the broadside is greatly weakened,\r\nowing to the obstructed arcs of fire.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the guns, being placed at some distance from the\r\nmidship line, have less accurate fire in rolling, and the ship’s\r\npropensities to roll are encouraged and are greater than would be the\r\ncase if the guns were placed on the midship line. It is also found\r\nthat the blast from the heavy guns is destructive to superstructures\r\nand other fittings on the upper deck. The Italians, indeed, have\r\nplaced stout ventilating shafts on their _Italia_ and _Lepanto_ to\r\nprevent the rearmost pair of heavy guns from being trained within\r\ntwenty degrees of the fore and aft line. This is done so that the\r\nblast from these guns will not prostrate the gunners attending the\r\nother pair, notwithstanding the fact that those men are under the\r\narmor cover. The _Duilio’s_ forward smoke-pipe is placed entirely\r\non the port side of the fore and aft line, in order to permit of\r\none pair of turret guns firing ahead. The upper-deck, 6-inch,\r\ncentral-pivot guns of the _Andrea Doria_ class are now to be placed\r\nwholly within the superstructure, in order to be out of danger from\r\nthe blast of the heavy guns when the latter are fired near the\r\nline of keel, and the same change would have to be made with the\r\nupper-deck, 6-inch guns in the Barrow design.\r\n\r\nSimilar objections exist to the Bureau of Construction design for an\r\narmored cruiser. This vessel, although possessing the bad features\r\ninherent in the _échelon_ arrangement of heavy guns, does not have\r\nthe best ideas of the Barrow design, _i.e._, high freeboard, heavy\r\nguns mounted high above the water-line, and commodious quarters for\r\nofficers and men. Both designs besides have the very objectionable\r\nand old-fashioned features of requiring the turrets to be revolved\r\nto fixed loading positions after being fired. The Bureau cruiser, it\r\nmay be said, is not saddled with too much metacentric height. She has\r\nten feet less beam, her centre of gravity is about one foot lower,\r\nand unless her water-line coefficient is very full, she will have a\r\nmetacentric height rather less than what is regarded to be the best.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, however, that the Bureau plans are so different\r\nin efficiency, for while the better plan, the battle-ship, is\r\noriginal with the Navy Department, the armored cruiser is a copy\r\nof, and no substantial improvement over, that of the Brazilian ship\r\n_Riachuelo_ designed several years ago. This ship is considered one\r\nof the best of her date, but great improvements in ship design have\r\nbeen made within the past few years, and it is against the tendencies\r\nof American inventive genius to take a step backward.\r\n\r\nThe general plans of cruisers No. 4 and 5 were published in the _New\r\nYork Herald_ of June 1st, together with the following data:\r\n\r\n“They are to be twin-screw cruisers, 310 feet long on the water-line,\r\n49 feet 1¾ inches extreme breadth, 18 feet 9 inches mean draught,\r\ndisplacing 4083 tons. They are to have machinery of 10,500 indicated\r\nhorse-power under forced draft. The maximum speed is 19 knots, rig\r\nthat of a three-masted schooner, spreading 5400 square feet of sail.\r\nThey will have a double bottom extending through 129 feet of the\r\nlength. The framing in this portion is on the bracket system. Before\r\nand abaft the double bottom, above the protective deck, Z-bars form\r\nthe transverse frames. The protective deck, which is nineteen inches\r\nabove the water-line amidships, is flat across the top, with sides\r\nwhich slope down to a depth of four feet three inches below the\r\nwater-line. The horizontal portion is two inches thick, the slope\r\nbeing three inches, reduced at both ends to one and a half inches. It\r\nextends uninterruptedly forward and aft, and protects the machinery,\r\nmagazines, and steering-gear, the machinery being further defended by\r\nthe disposition of the coal-bunkers. The main hatches in this deck\r\nare protected by armor-bars, and have coffer-dams extending to the\r\nupper deck. The guns are carried on the gun, forecastle, and poop\r\ndecks.\r\n\r\n“_Armament._—The main battery, which consists of twelve 6-inch\r\nbreech-loading rifles, all on centre-pivot mounts, with two-inch\r\nsegmental steel shields, is arranged on sponsons so as to obtain\r\nthe greatest possible arc of fire. The forecastle, the poop, and\r\nthe bridges have been as much as possible availed of to shelter\r\nthe guns. The two guns forward and the two guns aft converge their\r\nfire a short distance from the ends of the ship, and the broadside\r\ncan be concentrated within 100 feet of the side. Four above-water\r\ntorpedo-tubes are provided on the berth-deck, and two direct ahead\r\nunder-water torpedoes in the bow. The secondary battery is composed\r\nof four 47-millimetre revolvers, four 57-millimetre single-shots, two\r\n37-millimetre revolvers, and one short Gatling. The coal capacity is\r\n850 tons. The complement of men 300....\r\n\r\n“To appreciate what is required to make nineteen knots an hour at\r\nsea, we have only to remember that the _Umbria_ and _Etruria_ are\r\n500 feet long, with more than 12,000 tons displacement and 14,500\r\nindicated horse-power, ordinarily making 18½ and on special occasions\r\n19 knots an hour. Now, to increase her speed to 20 knots an hour,\r\nthe _Umbria_ would require about 19,500 horse-power, which means\r\n5000 extra horse-power for the extra knot. For a second extra knot\r\nwould be required about 6000 horse-power more, making about 25,000\r\nhorse-power necessary to develop a speed of 21 knots.”\r\n\r\nGun-boats Nos. 3 and 4 are to be copies of gun-boat No. 1. No designs\r\nfor the floating batteries and the torpedo-boat have been published.\r\nThe _Stiletto_ is one of the famous Herreshoff boats, and is now\r\nbeing tested in consequence of a favorable report made by a board of\r\nofficers. On July 23, 1886, with a total displacement of twenty-eight\r\ntons, she made an average of 22.12 knots as the mean of four runs\r\nover the measured mile in a rough sea and fresh wind, and on July\r\n30th she attained an average of 22.89 knots. These were excellent\r\nresults for a boat ninety feet in length, and promised that the\r\ntype, with certain modifications, was equal to greater demands. The\r\ntrial data of this year have not yet been published, though it is\r\nunofficially reported that her performance was equally as creditable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES NAVAL ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the introduction of cast-iron cannons in 1558 until\r\na comparatively late period, development in naval artillery proceeded\r\nat a very slow rate. The security that was attained by the adoption\r\nof cast-iron was so great, as compared with the danger attending the\r\nuse of the more ancient artillery, that the new guns were regarded as\r\nfully supplying all the demands of a suitable battery. The guns were\r\nmuzzle-loaders, making the manipulation simple, the previous rude\r\nattempts at breech-loading being abandoned. The number of calibres\r\nthat were introduced was very numerous, partly to suit the weight of\r\nthe batteries to the ships, and partly to accommodate the fancy of\r\nthe time for placing in different parts of the ships guns varying\r\nmuch in size and destructive effect. The general character of the\r\nbatteries and the multiplication of calibres can best be illustrated\r\nby noting the armament of two typical ships of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE BREECH-LOADING CANNON CAPTURED IN COREA, AGE\r\nUNKNOWN.]\r\n\r\nThe _Royal Prince_, a British ship built in 1610, carried\r\nfifty-five guns. Of these, two were _cannon-petronel_, or\r\n24-pounders; six were _demi-cannon_, medium 32-pounders; twelve were\r\n_culverins_, 18-pounders, which were nine feet long; eighteen were\r\n_demi-culverins_, nine-pounders; thirteen were _rakers_, 5-pounders,\r\nsix feet long; and four were _port-pieces_, probably swivels.\r\nThese guns were disposed as follows: on the lower gun-deck, two\r\n24-pounders, six medium 32-pounders, and twelve 18-pounders; on\r\nthe upper gun-deck the battery was entirely of 9-pounders; and the\r\nforecastle and quarter-deck were armed with 5-pounders, and the brood\r\nof smaller pieces which swelled the nominal armament.\r\n\r\nThe _Sovereign of the Seas_, built in 1637, in the reign of Charles\r\nI., was unequalled by any ship afloat in her time. She mounted on\r\nthree gun-decks eighty-six guns. On the lower deck were thirty long\r\n24-pounders and medium 32-pounders; on her middle deck, thirty\r\n12-pounders and 9-pounders; on the upper gun-deck, “other lighter\r\nordnance;” and on her quarter-deck and forecastle, “numbers of\r\nmurdering pieces.”\r\n\r\nIn the obstinately contested actions between Blake and Van Tromp in\r\nthe Cromwellian time, the ships and batteries did not differ in any\r\ngreat degree from those contemporaneous in construction with the\r\n_Sovereign of the Seas_; and when we remember the inferior character\r\nof the powder used in those days we can account for the duration of\r\nsome of the engagements between the English and Dutch ships which\r\nwere sometimes protracted through three days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE BREECH-LOADER USED BY CORTEZ IN MEXICO.]\r\n\r\nThe brood of “murdering pieces” of small calibre and little energy\r\nwas, after many years, dispersed by the introduction of carronades—a\r\nshort cannon of large calibre, which was found to be a convenient\r\nsubstitute for the 8-pounders and 9-pounders on upper decks, and for\r\nthe “lighter ordnance,” which was ineffective; but this change was\r\nbrought about slowly, as is seen by referring to the batteries of\r\nsome ships which fought at Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish seventy-fours in that action had fifty-eight long\r\n24-pounders on the gun-decks; on the spar-deck, ten iron 36-pounder\r\ncarronades and four long 8-pounders; and on the poop, six iron\r\n24-pounder carronades—total, seventy-eight guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREECH-LOADER CAPTURED IN THE WAR WITH MEXICO.]\r\n\r\nThe _Victory_, the English flag-ship, mounted on her three gun-decks\r\nninety long 32, 24, and 12 pounders, and on the quarter-deck and\r\nforecastle, ten long 12-pounders and two 68-pounder carronades.\r\n\r\nThe _Santissima Trinidada_ mounted on the lower gun-deck thirty long\r\n36-pounders; on the second deck, thirty-two long 18-pounders; on\r\nthe third deck thirty-two long 12-pounders; and on the spar-deck,\r\nthirty-two 8-pounders. In the British accounts she is said to have\r\nhad one hundred and forty guns, which number must have included\r\nswivels mounted for the occasion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century the 18-pounder was the preferred\r\ngun for the main-deck batteries of frigates, guns of larger calibre\r\nbeing found only on the lower decks of line-of-battle ships. The\r\n18-pounder was the maximum calibre that was employed on board the\r\nships of the United Colonies of North America in the war of the\r\nRevolution. The resources of the colonies did not admit of building\r\nships to contend with vessels fit to take their place in line of\r\nbattle, but such as were constructed were well adapted to resist the\r\nsmall British cruisers, and to capture transports and store-ships.\r\nThe so-called frigates of that day were vessels varying from six\r\nhundred to a thousand tons, and, according to their capacity, carried\r\n12-pounders or 18-pounders in the main-deck batteries. There was\r\nusually no spar-deck, but the forecastle and quarter-deck, which were\r\nconnected by gangways with gratings over the intermediate space,\r\nwere provided with an armament of light 6, 9, or 12 pounders. A few\r\ncarronades came into use during this war.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this war the Colonial fleet disappeared, and it\r\nwas not until the time of the depredations on the growing commerce\r\nof the United States by the Algerine corsairs that Congress felt\r\njustified in incurring the expense of establishing a national marine.\r\nThe ships which were built under the law of 1794 were fully up to\r\nthe most advanced ideas of the time, and some of these ships carried\r\non their gun-decks a full battery of 24-pounders, thirty in number,\r\nwhile the others were armed with 18-pounders on the gun-deck, with\r\nspar-deck batteries of 9 and 12 pounders, the carronade not having\r\nbeen yet definitely adopted for spar-deck batteries.\r\n\r\nIt is not until the war of 1812 that we find the carronade fully\r\nestablished as the spar-deck armament of frigates. The _Constitution_\r\nand the _Guerrière_ carried 32-pounder carronades of very similar\r\nweight and power in the place of the long guns of smaller calibre on\r\nthe spar-deck. The original name of this piece of ordnance was the\r\n“Smasher,” the leading purpose of the inventor, General Melville,\r\nof the British artillery, being to fire 68-pounder shot with a low\r\ncharge, thus effecting a greater destruction in a ship’s timbers\r\nby the increased splintering which this practice was known to\r\nproduce. Carronades of small calibre were subsequently cast, which\r\nwere adopted for spar-deck batteries of frigates and line-of-battle\r\nships, and, as they grew in favor, formed the entire battery of\r\nsloops-of-war and smaller vessels until about 1840, when the\r\nattention that had been given for some years to the subject of naval\r\nordnance began to assume tangible shape, and the effort was made to\r\nproceed in this matter in accordance with an intelligent system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE 12-POUNDER, “EL NEPTUNO,” 1781.]\r\n\r\nThe advantage of large calibre was firmly impressed upon those who\r\noccupied themselves with the ordnance matters of the navy. As the\r\nfleet was developed, the 24-pounder gave way to the 32-pounder, and\r\nfor the lower-deck battery of line-of-battle ships the 42-pounder\r\nwas introduced. Some 42-pounder carronades were also introduced as\r\nspar-deck batteries for these larger ships. With the disappearance of\r\nthis class of ship the 42-pounder was abandoned, and the 32-pounder\r\nwas retained as the maximum calibre, different classes being assigned\r\nto different sizes of ships. These classes were divided into the gun\r\nproper, with 150 pounds of metal to one of shot; the double-fortified\r\ngun, with 200 pounds of metal to one of shot; and the medium gun,\r\nwith 100 pounds of metal to one of shot. The carronade of the same\r\ncalibre, mounted on a slide, had a proportional weight of 65 pounds\r\nof metal to one of shot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U.S.N. CARRONADE, SLIDE, AND CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nIn the interval between 1840 and 1845 the double-fortified 32-pounder\r\nwas replaced by a gun of the same calibre of 57 hundred-weight,\r\ncalled the long 32-pounder; and to suit the capacity of the different\r\nclasses of ships then in the service, there were introduced\r\nthe 32-pounders of 46 hundred-weight, 42 hundred-weight, and\r\n27 hundred-weight, in addition to the regular medium gun of 32\r\nhundred-weight. This period also marks the introduction of shell-guns\r\nas part of the battery.\r\n\r\nTo this time no explosive projectiles had been used with cannons\r\nproperly so called; their use had been limited to mortars and\r\nhowitzers. The mortar was originally used for projecting huge balls\r\nof stone at high angles. The first practical use made of them\r\nfor projecting bombs was in 1624, but the unwieldy weight of the\r\nmortar and its bomb, the latter sometimes exceeding 300 pounds,\r\nprevented their use in field operations. To provide for this, light\r\nmortars were cast, which, being mounted on wheels, were denominated\r\nhowitzers. Frederick the Great of Prussia brought this form of\r\nartillery to its highest development for field and siege use, and\r\nthe Continental powers of Europe adopted it to a large extent for\r\nprojecting bombs at high angles of fire. The mortar has never had\r\na place in regular naval armaments; it has been used afloat for\r\nbombardment of cities and fortified positions, but never with a view\r\nto contending with ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U.S.N. MEDIUM 32-POUNDER.]\r\n\r\nThe success attending the use of explosive projectiles at high\r\nelevations did not lead at once to their application to horizontal\r\nfiring from cannons. An important link in the progress of the idea\r\nresulted from the effort to avail of the advantage of ricochet firing\r\nwith bombs. In order to effect this, the angle of elevation had to\r\nbe reduced to enable the bomb to roll along the ground. The reduced\r\nangle of elevation was still greater than that used for cannon, but\r\nthe success of the experiment led to the casting by the French of an\r\n8-inch siege howitzer, which, in connection with the development in\r\nthe manufacture of fuses, made it practicable to apply the idea of\r\nfiring shells, like shot, horizontally, and the chief object in view\r\nseems to have been to operate against ships.\r\n\r\nThe combining of the elements necessary for the achievement of this\r\nimportant step in naval artillery is by common consent credited to\r\nGeneral Paixhan, of the French artillery, who, though not claiming\r\nthe invention of any of the numerous details involved in the system,\r\nsucceeded in so judiciously arranging the parts as to make the system\r\npracticable by which the whole character of naval armaments was\r\nrevolutionized.\r\n\r\nFollowing the progressive ideas of the age, shell-guns were\r\nintroduced in the United States navy. These were of 8-inch calibre,\r\nand of weights of 63 hundred-weight and 55 hundred-weight. The\r\nguns were shaped in accordance with the form adopted by General\r\nPaixhan, and were easily distinguishable in the battery from the\r\nordinary shot-gun. From this circumstance they obtained the title of\r\nPaixhan-guns, though there was nothing special in the gun itself to\r\nmerit an appellation. The whole system was Paixhan’s; the gun was\r\nonly a part of the system.\r\n\r\nIt required many years to bring the shell-gun into such general\r\napplication as to displace the solid-shot gun. They were assigned\r\ntentatively to ships in commission, and in 1853, by a navy\r\nregulation, the battery of a frigate was provided with only ten of\r\nthese guns, which were collected in one division on the gun-deck. The\r\nfirst vessel in the United States navy whose battery was composed\r\nexclusively of shell-guns was the sloop-of-war _Portsmouth_, in 1856.\r\nThis vessel carried a battery of sixteen 8-inch shell-guns of 63\r\nhundred-weight. These were among the first of a new pattern of gun\r\nfor which the navy is indebted to the skill and study of the late\r\nRear-admiral Dahlgren.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the best form for cannons was a question which\r\nhad occupied the minds of artillerists for some years. In the older\r\nguns the thickness of metal was badly distributed; it was too\r\nuniformly extended along the entire length, not arranged in such\r\nproportions as to accord with the differing strains along the bore.\r\nColonel Bumford, of the United States Ordnance, had been among the\r\nfirst to consider this subject, and for many years the results of\r\nhis experiments had guided construction to a great degree. General\r\nPaixhan made a further step in advance by reducing very much the\r\nthickness of metal along the chase of his guns, but it remained for\r\nRear-admiral Dahlgren to produce the perfection of form in the gun\r\nso widely known bearing his name. In this gun the thickness of metal\r\nis proportioned to the effort of the gases in the bore, and all\r\nprojections and angular changes of form are suppressed, giving to\r\nall parts a curved and rounded surface. The suppression of angular\r\nformations on the exterior of a casting has a remarkable effect\r\non the arrangement of the crystals while cooling. These arrange\r\nthemselves normal to the cooling waves, which, if entering from\r\ndirections not radial with the cylindrical casting, produce confusion\r\nin their arrangement, establishing planes of weakness where the waves\r\nmeet, which, in case of overstrain on the piece, assist rupture and\r\ndetermine the course of the fracture.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the Dahlgren shell-gun the transition of\r\nthe artillery of the United States navy may be said to have been\r\ncompleted. The shell-gun of 9-inch and 11-inch calibres followed the\r\n8-inch, and ships were armed with such as were appropriate to their\r\ncapacity as rapidly as the new guns could be manufactured. When fully\r\nequipped, the armament of the United States navy was superior to that\r\nof any other navy in the world.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of shells for solid shot marks an important epoch in\r\nnaval artillery. The probable effect of a shot could be predetermined\r\nand provided for; that of a shell was unknown. In order to produce\r\nserious injury with a shot, it was necessary to perforate the side\r\nof an enemy. This was not indispensable with a shell; with the\r\nlatter, perforation might be dispensed with, as penetration to such\r\na depth as would give efficacy to the explosion might prove more\r\ndestructive to the hull than would absolute perforation. With the\r\nshot, damage was done to life and material in detail; with the shell,\r\nif successfully applied, destruction was threatened to the entire\r\nfabric, with all it contained. Naval artillery entered a new phase;\r\nthe rough appliances of the past would no longer answer all demands.\r\nThe founder could not alone equip the battery; the laboratory was\r\ncalled into use, and pressed to provide from its devices. The “new\r\narm” depended upon the successful working of the fuse of the shell,\r\nwithout which it was but a hollow substitute for a solid shot, and\r\nthis detail demanded the utmost care in preparation. It was the\r\nperfecting of this device which, more than aught else, delayed the\r\ngeneral adoption of the new artillery for so long a time after its\r\nadvantages had been recognized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U.S.N. 9-INCH DAHLGREN (9-INCH SMOOTH-BORE).]\r\n\r\nThe fuses that were used to explode the ancient bombs were long\r\nwooden plugs, bored cylindrically, and filled with powder condensed\r\nby tamping it to a hard consistency. The fuse case projected from the\r\nbomb, and to avoid being bent by the shock of discharge, was placed\r\ncarefully in the axis of fire. Before the discharge of the mortar\r\nthe fuse was lighted by a match. In applying the fuse to shell-guns\r\nfired horizontally, the problem was so to arrange it as to ignite\r\nit by the flame of discharge, and so to support it in the wall of\r\nthe shell as to prevent any dislocation of the fuse composition, the\r\ncracking of which would permit the penetration of the flame into\r\nthe mass. This was successfully accomplished, and the United States\r\nnavy fuse was justly famous, one feature of it being a simple but\r\nmost effective device called a “water-cap,” which guarded against\r\nthe injurious introduction of sand or water when the shell was fired\r\n_en ricochet_. The introduction of a safety-plug in the bottom of\r\nthe fuse case, which required the shock of discharge to displace it\r\nin order to open a way of communication between the fuse and the\r\nbursting charge in the shell, and the absence of all accidents in\r\nmanipulation, inspired such confidence that the new arm advanced to\r\nfavor, and both officers and men were proud to be identified with it.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the introduction of shells there had been in use\r\nincendiary projectiles, not explosive, but intended to set fire to an\r\nenemy’s vessel. Hot shot were applied to this purpose, but the use\r\nof these was chiefly confined to shore batteries, where a suitable\r\nheating furnace could be conveniently provided. The projectile for\r\nthis purpose chiefly used from ships was the carcass, which was a\r\nshot in which several radial cylindrical holes were formed which\r\nwere filled with powder tamped to a hard consistency; these columns\r\nof composition were ignited by the flame of discharge, and continued\r\nto burn until consumed. The flame issuing from these holes served to\r\nignite consumable material in their vicinity. The chief danger from\r\na carcass was from lodgment in the side of a ship; if it landed on\r\ndeck it could be removed and thrown overboard, as there was no danger\r\nfrom explosion; the addition of the bursting charge in the cavity\r\nof a shell produced a projectile which was far in advance both for\r\ngenerating a flame and for preventing interference with its mission.\r\n\r\nThe probable destructive effect of shells exploding in the sides\r\nor on the open decks of ships was thoroughly recognized, and\r\nexperiments at targets sufficiently proved it; but circumstances on\r\na proving-ground and in action are so dissimilar that the experience\r\nof a naval engagement was looked forward to with much interest, in\r\norder to satisfy as to the effect of the new projectile in all the\r\nvarying conditions of a sea-fight. Referring to the history of the\r\npast thirty years, which marks the period of the general introduction\r\nof shell-guns, it is remarkable how few engagements between ships\r\nhave taken place; but on every occasion of the use of shells, when\r\nunarmored vessels were engaged, the effect has been most decided\r\nand complete. Three instances only can be referred to of purely\r\nsea-fights, _viz._, the engagement between the Russian and Turkish\r\nfleets at Sinope in 1853, during the Crimean war, the engagement\r\nbetween the United States steamer _Hatteras_ and the Confederate\r\ncruiser _Alabama_ during the war of the rebellion, and the fight\r\nbetween the _Kearsarge_ and the _Alabama_ during the same war. In\r\nthe affair at Sinope the Russian ships used shells; the Turkish had\r\nonly solid shot. The result was the total destruction of the Turkish\r\nforce. Not one ship escaped; all were burned or sunk. The fight\r\nbetween the _Alabama_ and the _Hatteras_ resulted in the sinking\r\nof the _Hatteras_; and the contest between the _Alabama_ and the\r\n_Kearsarge_ ended the career of the _Alabama_. And it may be noticed\r\nthat but for the failure to explode of a shell that was embedded in\r\nthe stern-post of the _Kearsarge_, that vessel might have accompanied\r\nher antagonist to the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe gallant attempt of Rear-admiral Lyons with the British wooden\r\nfleet before the forts of Sebastopol is an instance which proved the\r\nuselessness of subjecting unarmored vessels to the steady fire of\r\nfortified positions using shells from their batteries.\r\n\r\nOne other instance of a sea-fight can be cited in the engagement in\r\n1879 between two Chilian armored vessels and the lightly armored\r\nPeruvian turreted vessel _Huascar_. The _Huascar_ was terribly\r\nover-matched during this fight, but at its conclusion her boilers and\r\nengines were intact, and indentations on her sides showed that her\r\nlight armor had deflected a number of projectiles; but the effect of\r\nthe shells that had burst on board of her was apparent in the great\r\ndestruction of life.\r\n\r\nThe very decisive engagement which took place at Lissa in 1866,\r\nbetween the Austrian and Italian fleets, should not be omitted in\r\nalluding to sea-fights of a late period; but this action can hardly\r\nbe quoted as one in which the element of shell-fire can be recognized\r\nas the exclusive cause of destruction, for the remarkable impetuosity\r\nand dash of the attack and the desperate use of the ram produced a\r\ncrisis which obviated the necessity for continuous bombardment with\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of providing a defence against shells was recognized\r\nboth by England and France during the Crimean war, and a protection\r\nof armor was supplied to some floating batteries built at that time\r\nwhich were intended to operate before fortified positions; and at the\r\nconclusion of the war the English built the _Warrior_ and the French\r\nbuilt _La Gloire_. These were the first specimens of iron-clad ships\r\nof war. They were capable of resisting successfully the entrance\r\nof shells from guns of the period. It is thus seen that almost\r\ncoincident with the general adoption of horizontal shell-firing,\r\nnaval construction entered a new phase, and a new problem was\r\nsubmitted to the naval artillerist.\r\n\r\nAgainst an iron-faced target the solid shot might be partially\r\neffective, but the impact of the spherical shell was harmless, and\r\nthe explosive effect of the bursting charge enclosed in it would be\r\nsuperficial. This was amply demonstrated in actual practice during\r\nour war experience, notably at Mobile Bar, in the engagement with the\r\nConfederate iron-clad _Tennessee_, the roughly constructed armor of\r\nwhich vessel resisted a storm of our heaviest shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORIZONTAL SECTION OF MILLWALL SHIELD.]\r\n\r\nThe impotency of the spherical shell against armor being recognized\r\nby foreign governments, they proceeded to develop the rifled\r\ncannon, which with its elongated projectile offered the means\r\nof effecting the object of the time—to perforate armor with an\r\nexplosive projectile. Our authorities, however, persevered in their\r\nfaith in the smooth-bore, and held that the _racking_ effect of a\r\nspherical projectile of sufficiently large calibre was superior to\r\nthat produced by the perforation of a rifle projectile of inferior\r\ndiameter. The 15-inch and 20-inch smooth-bore cannons were cast in\r\naccordance with this idea, and the racking side of the question was\r\nso obstinately held that the British government imported in 1867 from\r\nthe United States a 15-inch gun for the purpose of determining by\r\ntheir own experiments what foundation there was for the advantages\r\nthat were claimed for it. The gun was bought of Charles Alger & Co.,\r\nof Boston; it weighed nineteen tons, and threw a cast-iron spherical\r\nsolid shot of about four hundred and fifty pounds. It was mounted\r\nat Shoeburyness, and was fired in competition with English rifled\r\ncannons of 9-inch and 10-inch calibres. The result of the experiments\r\nwent to show that against a target with a power of resistance\r\ninferior to the energy of the projectile the effect of the large\r\nsphere at short range is more disastrous than that of the elongated\r\nrifle projectile of the same weight; but that against a target able\r\nto resist the total energy of both the injury done by the rifle\r\nprojectile is by far the greater. The comparative effect is well\r\nshown on a target called the “Millwall Shield,” consisting of a plate\r\nnine inches in thickness, backed by Hughes’s hollow stringers—an\r\narrangement of target which to the time of the experiment had proved\r\ninvincible. The 15-inch smooth-bore spherical shot rebounded from the\r\ntarget six feet, leaving a 3-inch indentation on the plate, while the\r\n9-inch rifle projectile, weighing two hundred and fifty pounds, made\r\ncomplete penetration of the plate, passing two or three inches into\r\nthe backing, and the 10-inch rifle projectile, weighing four hundred\r\npounds, penetrated to the rear of the backing itself.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned in this connection that the United States\r\ngovernment adopted during the war of the rebellion a rifled cannon\r\nproposed by Captain Parrott of the West Point Foundery, New York, of\r\nwhich many were introduced into both the navy and army, and did good\r\nservice as long as the charges of powder were limited in weight; but\r\nwhen these guns were called upon for work requiring great endurance,\r\nthey proved untrustworthy and dangerous to those who served them.\r\nAt the naval bombardment of Fort Fisher several of them burst,\r\ncausing loss of life on board the vessels of which they formed the\r\narmament. They were constructed of cast-iron, having a coiled hoop\r\nof wrought-iron shrunk around the breech. They have ceased to form a\r\npart of our naval armament.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of inaction in the United States that have\r\nintervened since these experiments, the smooth-bore partisans have\r\nhad time to reflect and to learn lessons of practical usefulness from\r\nobserving what has been transpiring abroad. Opportunities have been\r\nafforded to note the progress made in armor and artillery, and though\r\nthe smooth-bore shell is still operative against unarmored vessels,\r\nthe advantages of the rifled gun under all the circumstances of navy\r\nexperiences have been admitted, and in the transition through which\r\nour naval artillery is now passing we are not embarrassed by the\r\npresentation of views antagonistic to the principles on which it has\r\nbeen determined our new artillery is to be constructed. The system\r\nat the basis of our present acts is founded on a comprehensive view\r\nof the whole subject, and is intended to provide our ships with a\r\nsurplus of offensive power over what their capacity for defence might\r\nseem to call for.\r\n\r\nOur navy will possess a certain number of armored vessels for coast\r\ndefence, and armored sea-cruisers are certain to be included in\r\nthe list, but the more numerous class will be unarmored, and the\r\nfirst problem to be solved is that of providing for these a suitable\r\narmament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KRUPP GUN ON A NAVAL CARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe work to be done by an unarmored cruiser must be done from a\r\ndistance when risking an engagement with an armored enemy. The\r\nsuperiority of armament must compensate for deficiency in defensive\r\npower which precludes close quarters. To make these ships effective\r\nthey must be armed with guns capable of doing an extraordinary amount\r\nof work, and yet the size of the vessels will not admit of their\r\ncarrying guns of immense weight. In order to get this amount of\r\nwork out of a comparatively light gun, we must secure great initial\r\nvelocity for the projectile. This can only be done by burning a large\r\ncharge of powder, which involves a long bore in which to burn it,\r\nwhile care is necessary to secure a large margin of strength in the\r\nmaterial of which the gun is constructed. These essential demands\r\nrequired a radical change in the form and material of our present\r\narmament; they also forced a change in the method of construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED KRUPP.]\r\n\r\nThe superior fitness for cannons of steel over cast-iron was\r\nrecognized many years ago, but the difficulty of casting steel\r\nin large masses prevented the introduction of steel guns, and\r\nthe generally acceptable treatment of cast-iron made it answer\r\nsatisfactorily the demands for gun-metal not subjected to unusual\r\nstrains. Mr. Frederick Krupp, of Essen, in Germany, was the first\r\nsteel manufacturer who succeeded in casting steel in large masses,\r\nand he produced a number of steel guns cast from crucibles in solid\r\ningots, which were bored, turned, and fashioned as in the case of\r\ncast-iron smooth-bore guns. These guns held a position in advance\r\nof other manufactures on the score of strength of material. But the\r\nintroduction of the rifle system, the call for higher velocities, the\r\nincreased charges of powder, with the consequent increase of strain,\r\nenhanced by the friction attending the passage of the projectile\r\nforced along the bore, had the effect of calling attention to the\r\nweakness that was inherent in the method of construction of cannons.\r\nIt is well known that an explosive force operating in the interior\r\nof a hollow cylinder of any thickness is not felt equally throughout\r\nthe wall of metal; the parts near the seat of explosion are called\r\nupon to do much more work in restraining the force generated than are\r\nthe parts more remote. It has been determined that the strain brought\r\nupon the portions of the wall is in inverse proportion to the squares\r\nof their distances from the seat of effort. Thus, in a gun cast\r\nsolid, if we take a point two inches from the bore, and another four\r\ninches from the bore, the strain felt at those points respectively\r\nwill be inversely in the proportion of four to sixteen, or, in other\r\nwords, the metal at two inches from the bore will be strained four\r\ntimes as much as that at the distance of four inches. From this it\r\ncan be seen that the metal near the seat of effort may be strained\r\nbeyond its tensile strength, while that more distant is only in\r\npartial sympathy with it. Rupture thus originates at the interior\r\nportion, and the rest of the wall yields in detail. No additional\r\nstrength of material can change this relationship between the parts;\r\nthey result from a law, and show that this method of construction\r\nfor a cannon is untrustworthy where the strains approach the tensile\r\nstrength of the material.\r\n\r\nThe means of providing against this successive rupture of\r\nover-strained parts is found in the “built-up gun,” in which an\r\ninterior tube is surrounded by encircling hoops of metal, which are\r\nshrunk on at sufficient tension to compress the portions which they\r\nenclose. This is the principle of “initial tension,” which is the\r\nbasis of the modern construction of cannons. By adopting this method,\r\nan ingot to form a tube to burn the required amount of powder can be\r\ncast of a light weight in comparison with what would be needed for\r\na complete gun, and the strength and number of reinforcing rings to\r\nbe shrunk around it can be readily determined, proportioned to the\r\nknown strain that will be brought upon the bore of the piece. The\r\nlate developments in the manufacture of steel by the open-hearth\r\nprocess remove all difficulty to procuring the necessary metal in\r\nmasses suitable for all parts of the heaviest guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREECH-LOADING RIFLE-TUBE READY FOR RECEIVING JACKET.]\r\n\r\nThe built-up steel gun is the one now adopted in Europe by the\r\nleading powers, and it is the gun with which the United States navy\r\nwill be armed; but, before its final adoption, efforts were made to\r\nconvert old smooth-bore cast-iron guns into rifles, and to construct\r\nnew guns partially of steel and partly of wrought-iron. As some of\r\nthese methods of conversion offered an economical means of acquiring\r\nrifled cannons, our naval authorities were led into the error of\r\ncountenancing the effort to a moderate degree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREECH-LOADING RIFLE-JACKET, ROUGH-BORED AND TURNED.]\r\n\r\nThe system that was adopted was that originally suggested by Mr.\r\nP. M. Parsons in England, which was afterwards patented by Major\r\nPalliser, R.A., and bears his name. It consisted in enlarging the\r\nbore of a cast-iron gun, and inserting a tube of wrought-iron formed\r\nof a bar arranged in the form of a coil when heated. The tube was\r\nexpanded by firing charges of powder, and afterwards rifled. The guns\r\nare muzzle-loaders, and are not increased in length beyond that of\r\nthe cast-iron gun which forms the casing for the tube. The length is\r\nthus limited in order to preserve the preponderance of the piece,\r\nand because of the want of longitudinal strength in the coil, which\r\ncannot be depended on beyond a few tons’ strain; the arrangement of\r\nmetal in a coil provides very well for circumferential or tangential\r\nstrains, but in the Palliser conversion the longitudinal strength\r\ndepends on the cast-iron casing. The idea of the coiled wrought-iron\r\ntube originated with Professor Treadwell, of Harvard University, in\r\n1841. He utilized it by enclosing a tube of cast-iron or steel in\r\nthe same manner as it is applied in the wrought-iron Armstrong and\r\nWoolwich guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTING THE JACKET ON A 6-INCH BREECH-LOADING\r\nRIFLE-TUBE.]\r\n\r\nThe administration of our naval ordnance has abandoned conversions,\r\nand has concentrated its efforts on the production of an armament\r\nof built-up steel guns. The system of construction that has been\r\nadopted originated in England, but was for many years ignored by\r\nthe government authorities. It involved the use of steel in all its\r\nparts, and this was charged as an objection, as confidence in this\r\nmetal was not established in the minds of the English artillerists.\r\nThat government committed itself entirely to the wrought-iron gun\r\nproposed by Mr. (now Lord) Armstrong, whose system was a reproduction\r\nof that successfully experimented on by Professor Treadwell, and the\r\nentire force of the government works at Woolwich and of the Armstrong\r\nworks at Elswick-on-the-Tyne was occupied with the production of this\r\nstyle of ordnance. The English steel gun invented by Captain Blakely\r\nand Mr. J. Vavasseur was ignored in England, but its merit could not\r\nbe suppressed, and its superiority has forced a tardy recognition by\r\nthat government.\r\n\r\nThis gun came prominently into notice for a short time at the\r\nbreaking out of the war of the rebellion: some guns were imported\r\nfor the service of the Southern States. At the exhibition in London\r\nin 1862 a Blakely 8.5-inch gun was one of the features of attraction\r\nin the department of ordnance. The principle of the construction\r\nwas shown in this gun, consisting in shrinking a long jacket of\r\nsteel around an enclosed steel tube, the jacket extending to the\r\ntrunnions. Mr. Vavasseur was the manager of the London Ordnance\r\nWorks, and was associated with Captain Blakely in the manufacture of\r\nhis earlier guns, but the entire business soon fell into the hands\r\nof Mr. Vavasseur, whose name alone is associated with the succeeding\r\ndevelopments of the gun.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the guns manufactured by Mr. Krupp were solid forgings. He\r\nadvanced but slowly towards the construction of built-up cannons, and\r\nit was not until the failure of some of his solid-cast guns that he\r\nentered on the built-up system. His first steps were to strengthen\r\nthe rear portion of new guns by shrinking on hoops, and to increase\r\nthe strength of old guns he turned down the breech and shrunk on\r\nhoops. He confined this system of strengthening to the rear of the\r\ntrunnions until he was reminded of the necessity of strength along\r\nthe chase of the gun by the blowing off of the chase of some 11-inch\r\nguns of his manufacture. His system was then modified so as to\r\ninvolve reinforcing the tube of the larger calibred guns along its\r\nwhole length with hoops, and his later and largest productions are\r\nprovided with a long jacket reinforcing the entire breech portion of\r\nthe tube—a virtual adoption of the great element of strength which\r\nhas always formed the essential feature in the Vavasseur gun which is\r\nnow adopted in the United States navy.\r\n\r\nIn the building up of the steel gun for the navy advantage is so\r\ntaken of the elastic characteristic of the metal that all parts tend\r\nto mutual support. The gun proper consists of a steel tube and a\r\nsteel jacket shrunk around it, reaching from the breech to and beyond\r\nthe location of the trunnion-band. Outside the jacket and along the\r\nchase of the gun there are shrunk on such hoops as the known strain\r\non the tube may make necessary for its support. The tube is formed\r\nfrom a casting which is forged, rough-bored, and turned, and then\r\ntempered in oil, by which its elasticity and tensile strength are\r\nmuch increased. It is then turned on the exterior, and adjusted to\r\nthe jacket, the proper difference being allowed for shrinkage. The\r\njacket, previously turned and tempered, is then heated, and rapidly\r\nlowered to its place. The front hoops over the chase are then put\r\non, and the gun is put into a lathe and turned to receive the\r\ntrunnion-band and rear and front hoops. The gun is then fine-bored\r\nand rifled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREECH-LOADING RIFLE AFTER RECEIVING JACKET.]\r\n\r\nEach part, as successively placed in position, is expected to\r\ncompress the parts enclosed through the initial tension due to\r\ncontraction in cooling. This tension is the greater the farther the\r\npart is removed from the tube; thus the jacket is shrunk on at a less\r\ntension than are the encircling hoops. By this means full use is\r\nmade of the elastic capacity of the tube which contributes the first\r\nresistance to the expanding influence of the charge. The tension of\r\nthe jacket prevents the tube being forced up to its elastic limit,\r\nand it in turn experiences the effect of the tension of the other\r\nencircling parts which contribute to the general support; thus no\r\npart is strained beyond its elastic limit, and on the cessation\r\nof the pressure all resume their normal form and dimensions. A\r\ncomparison of this method of common and mutual support of parts with\r\nthat given by the wall of a gun cast solid will serve to demonstrate\r\nthe superior strength of the construction. In order to achieve this\r\nintimate working of all the parts it is necessary that the metal\r\nof which they are respectively composed must be possessed of the same\r\nessential characteristics; in a word, the gun must be homogeneous.\r\nIt was the absence of this feature in the Armstrong gun which has\r\ncaused its abolition. This gun was built up, and the parts were\r\nexpected to contribute mutual support, but the want of homogeneity\r\nbetween the steel tube and the encircling hoops of wrought-iron made\r\nit impossible for them to work in accord, in consequence of the\r\ndifferent elastic properties of the two metals, which, after frequent\r\ndischarges, resulted in a separation of surfaces between the tube and\r\nhoops, when the tube cracked from want of support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KRUPP HAMMER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSPORTING CANNON AT BREMERHAVEN.]\r\n\r\nIn the construction of the guns for the United States navy, as in\r\nthe new steel guns now being manufactured in England, the theory\r\nof the built-up system is practically conformed to; more so than by\r\nKrupp or the French artillerists, who use a thicker tube than is\r\nconsidered judicious at Woolwich or at the Washington navy-yard. Any\r\nincrease of thickness of the tube beyond what is necessary to receive\r\nthe initial pressure of the charge is open to the objections made to\r\nthe gun with a solid wall, the proportion of the strain communicated\r\nto the hoops is reduced, and rupture may ensue from overstraining\r\nthe tube. The thicker the tube, the less appreciable must be the\r\ncompression induced by the tension of the encircling hoops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREECH-LOADING RIFLE AFTER RECEIVING JACKET AND CHASE\r\nHOOPS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREECH-LOADING RIFLE WITH JACKET, CHASE HOOPS, AND\r\nJACKET HOOPS IN PLACE.]\r\n\r\nThe gun is a breech-loader. The system adopted for closing the\r\nbreech is an American invention (see note, p. 257), but having\r\nbeen employed in France from the earliest experimental period, it\r\nis known as the French _fermeture_. A screw is cut in the rear end\r\nof the jacket to the rear of the tube, and a corresponding screw\r\nis cut upon a breech-plug. The screw threads are stripped at three\r\nequidistant places, the screw and plane surfaces alternating, thus\r\nforming what is called an “interrupted” or “slotted” screw. The screw\r\nportions of the breech-plug enter freely along the plane longitudinal\r\nsurfaces cut in the tube, and being then turned one-sixth of its\r\ncircumference, the screw of the plug locks in that of the tube, and\r\nthe breech is closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U.S.N. 6-INCH BREECH-LOADING RIFLE.]\r\n\r\nThe success of this system of breech mechanism was not so pronounced\r\non its introduction as it is to-day. The plug forms the base of the\r\nbreech of the gun, and all the effort of the gases to blow out the\r\nbreech is exerted at this point. The impact upon the end of the plug\r\nis very severe, and has a tendency to _upset_ the metal, thereby\r\nincreasing the diameter of the plug, which would prevent its removal\r\nafter the discharge of the piece. With quick-burning powder, as was\r\ngenerally in use for cannons at the inception of the breech-loading\r\nexperiments, this result ensued if the charges of powder were carried\r\nabove a certain limit, and the consequent restriction that was\r\nput upon velocities was a serious obstacle to the adoption of the\r\nsystem; but the progress that has been made of late years in the\r\nscience of gunpowder manufacture has relieved the subject from this\r\nembarrassment, powder being now provided which communicates very high\r\nvelocities while developing pressures so moderate and regular as to\r\nbe entirely under the control of the artillerist.\r\n\r\nThe original guns, four in number, constructed with breech mechanism\r\non the French _fermeture_ principle for the British government during\r\nthe Crimean war are now in the “Graveyard” at Woolwich Arsenal.\r\n\r\nThe projectiles for the new armament are of two kinds; both, however,\r\nare shells. That for ordinary use against unarmored vessels is\r\nstyled the common shell, and is of cast-iron. The length bears a\r\nuniform proportion to the gun, being in all cases three and a half\r\ncalibres. The armor-piercing shell is made of forged steel, and is\r\nthree calibres in length. The following table gives the particulars,\r\napproximately, of the common shell:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+------------------+--------+---------+\r\n  |              GUN.            |      Length.     | Weight.| Bursting|\r\n  |                              |                  |        | Charge. |\r\n  +------------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n  |                              | Inches.| Calibre.| Pounds.| Pounds. |\r\n  |  5 inch breech-loading rifle | 17.97  |   3.59  |    60  |    2    |\r\n  |  6-inch breech-loading rifle | 20.90  |   3.48  |   100  |    4    |\r\n  |  8-inch breech-loading rifle | 28.10  |   3.51  |   250  |   12    |\r\n  | 10 inch breech-loading rifle | 35.00  |   3.50  |   500  |   22    |\r\n  | 12 inch breech-loading rifle | 42.00  |   3.50  |   850  |   38    |\r\n  | 16-inch breech-loading rifle | 56.00  |   3.50  |  2000  |   90    |\r\n  +------------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\nThe armor-piercing shell of the same weight is reduced in length,\r\nand its walls are thicker; the bursting charge is consequently much\r\nreduced. The following are the particulars, approximately determined:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+------------------+--------+---------+\r\n  |            GUN.              |      Length.     | Weight.| Bursting|\r\n  |                              |                  |        | Charge. |\r\n  +------------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n  |                              | Inches.| Calibre.| Pounds.| Pounds. |\r\n  |  5-inch breech-loading rifle |  15.07 |   3.01  |    60  |   1     |\r\n  |  6-inch breech-loading rifle |  17.91 |   2.98  |   100  |   1.50  |\r\n  |  8-inch breech-loading rifle |  24.25 |   3.03  |   250  |   3.50  |\r\n  | 10-inch breech-loading rifle |  30.00 |   3.00  |   500  |   7     |\r\n  | 12-inch breech-loading rifle |  36.00 |   3.00  |   850  |  14     |\r\n  | 16-inch breech-loading rifle |  48.00 |   3.00  |  2000  |  30     |\r\n  +------------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\nThe rifle motion is communicated by one rotating ring of copper,\r\nwhich is placed at the distance of 1.5 inch from the base of the\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTRIDGE CASE AND GRAINS OF POWDER, U.S.N.]\r\n\r\nThe uniform windage for all calibres is .04 inch; thus, taking the\r\n6-inch gun as an example, the diameter of the bore across the lands\r\nis 6 inches, the diameter of the shell is 5.96 inches, the depth of\r\nthe grooves is .05 inch; thus the diameter of the bore across the\r\ngrooves is 6.10 inches. In order to permit the rotating ring to fill\r\nthe grooves, it must have a diameter of 6.14 inches; this causes a\r\n_squeeze_ of .05 inch between the lands and the rotating ring.\r\n\r\nThere is no subject in the development of the new naval artillery\r\nmore important than the powder. That used with the old artillery is\r\nentirely unsuited to the new conditions that obtain in the modern\r\nhigh-power guns. A brown powder, introduced first in Germany, has\r\nexhibited decided advantages over all others, and the efforts to\r\nreproduce it have been thoroughly successful at the Du Pont Mills.\r\nIt is generally known as “cocoa” powder. Its peculiarity exists in\r\nthe method of preparing the charcoal; this affects the color, and\r\nresults in a brown instead of a black powder. With this powder,\r\nexperiments with the 6-inch gun give a muzzle velocity of over 2000\r\nfeet per second with a projectile of 100 pounds, using charges of 50\r\npounds, and this result is obtained with less than 15 tons pressure\r\nper square inch in the powder chamber. The grain is prismatic, with\r\na central perforation, and as regards its rate of burning, is under\r\ncomplete control in the manufacture; the form provides an increasing\r\nsurface for the flame during the period of combustion, thus\r\nrelieving the gun from abnormal pressures at the moment of ignition,\r\nbut continuing the extreme pressure farther along the bore. The\r\nprogressive nature of the combustion is very apparent when comparing\r\nan unburned grain with others partially consumed, blown out from the\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMON SHELLS, U.S.N.]\r\n\r\nThe gun-carriage, which is a separate study in itself, is carried to\r\na high pitch of perfection, and presents many features being adopted\r\nabroad. The importance of a suitable carriage can be appreciated by\r\ninspecting the following table, which exhibits the _energy_ that must\r\nbe controlled by it:\r\n\r\n           Part 1 of 2\r\n  +------------------------------------+---------+-----------+---------+\r\n  |                                    |         |           |         |\r\n  |                                    | Weight  |  Weight   | Muzzle  |\r\n  |                GUN.                |   of    |    of     |Velocity.|\r\n  |                                    | Charge. |Projectile.|         |\r\n  +------------------------------------+---------+-----------+---------+\r\n  |                                    | Pounds. |   Pounds. |  Feet.  |\r\n  |  5-inch steel breech-loading rifle |    30   |      60   |   1915  |\r\n  |  6-inch steel breech-loading rifle |    50   |     100   |   1915  |\r\n  |  8-inch steel breech-loading-rifle |   125   |     250   |   2050  |\r\n  | 10-inch steel breech-loading rifle |   250   |     500   |   2100  |\r\n  | 12-inch steel breech-loading rifle |   425   |     850   |   2100  |\r\n  | 14-inch steel breech-loading rifle |   675   |    1350   |   2100  |\r\n  | 16-inch steel breech-loading rifle |  1000   |    2000   |   2100  |\r\n  +------------------------------------+---------+-----------+---------+\r\n\r\n           Part 2 of 2\r\n  +---------+----------+-------------+----------+----------+-----------+\r\n  |         |          | Penetration |  Muzzle  |          |           |\r\n  |         |  Muzzle  |     in      |  Energy  |  Weight  | Weight of |\r\n  |  GUN.   |  Energy. |Wrought-iron.|  per Ton |  of Gun. | Carriage. |\r\n  |         |          |             |  of Gun. |          |           |\r\n  +---------+----------+-------------+----------+----------+-----------+\r\n  |         | Ft.-Tons.|   Inches.   | Ft.-Tons.|  Pounds. |  Pounds.  |\r\n  |  5-inch |   1,525  |    10.7     |    552   |   6,187  |   4,200   |\r\n  |  6-inch |   2,542  |    13.2     |    521   |  11,000  |   6,400   |\r\n  |  8-inch |   7,285  |    18.2     |    560   |  28,000  |  14,000   |\r\n  | 10-inch |  15,285  |    23.7     |    588   |  58,240  |  32,482   |\r\n  | 12-inch |  25,985  |    27.6     |    591   |  44 tons |   ....    |\r\n  | 14-inch |  41,270  |    32.2     |    550   |  75 tons |   ....    |\r\n  | 16-inch |  61,114  |    36.8     |    571   | 107 tons |   ....    |\r\n  +---------+----------+-------------+----------+----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nThis _energy_, total energy, expresses the work that the gun can\r\nperform. It is expressed in foot-tons, and signifies that the energy\r\ndeveloped is sufficient to raise the weight in tons to a height of\r\none foot. Thus the projectile from the small 5-inch gun, weighing\r\nsixty pounds, fired with a charge of thirty pounds of powder, leaves\r\nthe gun with an energy capable of lifting 1525 tons to the height of\r\none foot! Comparing this with the energy developed by the 100-ton\r\nhammer at the forge of Le Creuzot in France, the energy of which is\r\n1640 foot-tons, we have a most striking illustration of the power of\r\ngunpowder, and the testimony in the table as to the energy developed\r\nper ton of gun more forcibly exhibits the perfection of a manufacture\r\nwhich, with so little weight of gun, can develop such gigantic power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNBURNED AND PARTIALLY CONSUMED GRAINS OF U.S.N.\r\nPOWDER]\r\n\r\nIt is this power, united with a moderate weight of gun, which\r\nwill enable our unarmored cruisers to hold their own with vessels\r\nmoderately armored. The power of the battery is greater than is\r\nrequired to contend with unarmored ships, there is a great surplus\r\nof power of offence, and the effort is very properly made to sustain\r\nthis at the highest practicable point. The table shows that the\r\n5-inch gun can perforate 10.7 inches of wrought-iron at the muzzle;\r\nbut the results given in tables are based on deliberate firing made\r\non a practice-ground, with the position of the target normal to the\r\nline of fire. Such conditions cannot obtain during an action at\r\nsea, for, besides the modified effect caused by increased distance\r\nof target, it must be borne in mind that the side of an enemy’s\r\nship will be presented at varying angles, which introduces the\r\nelement of deflection, than which no cause is more detrimental to\r\npenetration. Though the table states a fact, the practical effect of\r\nthe projectile will be far less than is stated, hence the wisdom of\r\nproviding a large surplus of power to compensate for the resistance\r\nto its operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF U.S.N. 6-INCH BUILT-UP STEEL BREECH-LOADING\r\nRIFLE.]\r\n\r\nIt will readily be conceded that the artillerist has a very\r\nresponsible duty to perform in so designing his gun that the parts\r\nshall lock and interlock to guard against chance of dislocation in\r\nthe structure. A study of the illustration of the 6-inch built-up gun\r\nas constructed at the Washington navy-yard will show the system there\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROADSIDE CARRIAGE FOR 6-INCH BREECH-LOADING RIFLE.]\r\n\r\nIn the list of guns each calibre is represented by one gun. We have\r\nnot, as of old, several guns of the same calibre differing in weight;\r\nmultiplicity of classes will be avoided; but this will apply only\r\nto the main battery, for history is singularly repeating itself at\r\nthis time in the restoration of the “murdering pieces” which have\r\nbeen cited as forming part of naval armaments in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The needfulness of machine guns for operating against men on\r\nopen decks, for effecting entrance through port-holes, for repelling\r\nattacks in boats, and for resisting the approach of torpedo-boats,\r\nis so widely recognized that no vessel of war is considered properly\r\nequipped without a secondary battery of these “murdering pieces.”\r\nThey are mounted on the rail, on platforms projecting from the sides\r\nand in the tops. The types adopted in the United States navy are the\r\nHotchkiss revolving cannon and rapid-firing single-shot guns, and the\r\nsmaller calibre machine guns of Gatling. The heavier pieces, throwing\r\nshells of six pounds weight, are very effective against vessels of\r\nordinary scantling.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the present condition of our new naval armament\r\nwe have the consolation of knowing that, so far as concerns the\r\nstudy of the subject generally and in detail, the designs, and the\r\ninitial manufacture, all has been done that could have been done\r\nwith the resources available. What has been achieved has been\r\nwithout the facilities that are provided in modern gun-factories;\r\nbut notwithstanding all the drawbacks, it is probably safe to assert\r\nthat no guns in the world to-day are superior to those that have\r\nbeen fabricated at the Washington navy-yard of steel on the new\r\nadopted pattern. The work at this ordnance yard is carried on without\r\nostentation; there is no flourish of trumpets accompanying its\r\noperations; it is not advertised, and the people do not yet know how\r\nmuch they owe to the ordnance officers of the navy for the initiation\r\nof this new industry, which enables us to assert our ability to\r\nadvance in this manufacture through the incontrovertible proof of\r\nwork accomplished. The results are meagre in quantity, and at the\r\npresent rate of manufacture it will require many years to equip our\r\nfleet with modern artillery; this should be remedied, as there is now\r\nno doubt as to the success of the productions of this establishment.\r\nThe plant should be enlarged on a liberal and well-matured plan, and\r\nthe work should be encouraged by generous appropriations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAPID-FIRING SINGLE-SHOT HOTCHKISS GUN.]\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known that the steel forgings required for\r\nthe few 8-inch and the two 10-inch guns now in hand were imported\r\nfrom abroad, for the reason that they could not be furnished\r\nof domestic manufacture, from the want of casting and forging\r\nfacilities in the United States for work of such magnitude. This\r\nwas a deficiency in our resources that required prompt attention to\r\nsecure us a position of independence in this important matter. The\r\nmethod of achieving the object was carefully studied out by a mixed\r\nboard of army and navy officers, and presented in a document known\r\nas the “Gun Foundery Board Report,” and the subject received the\r\nattention of committees from both Houses of Congress. All of these\r\nreports virtually agreed as to the method, but there was a useless\r\ndelay in action; large expenditures of money were required, and\r\nthere was hesitancy in assuming the responsibility of recommending\r\nit. The object was of national importance, however, and public\r\nopinion demanded its accomplishment. The officers of the navy have\r\nproved their ability to carry on the work successfully; and if the\r\nopportunity be given they will establish the artillery of the United\r\nStates navy in a position of which the country may again be proud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nGUNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States no longer depend upon foreigners for guns or\r\narmor, inasmuch as the circular issued in August, 1886, by the Navy\r\nDepartment inviting all domestic steel manufacturers to state the\r\nterms upon which they were willing to produce the steel plates and\r\nforgings required for ships and ordnance, has met with a prompt\r\nresponse. About 4500 tons were needed for armor, in plates varying\r\nfrom 20 feet by 8 feet by 12 inches thick, to 11.6 feet by 4.3 feet\r\nby 6 inches thick; and of the 1310 tons of steel forgings, 328 tons\r\nwere intended for the 6-inch guns, 70 tons for the 8-inch, and 912\r\ntons for the calibres between 10 and 12 inches, both inclusive. The\r\nrough-bored and turned forgings required by the contract were to\r\nweigh 3¼ tons for the 6-inch calibres, 5 tons for the 8-inch, 9½\r\ntons for the 10-inch, 9¾ tons for the 10½-inch, and 12½ tons for\r\nthe 12-inch. From the time of closing the contract twenty-eight\r\n6-inch forgings were to be delivered in one year, and the remainder\r\nwithin eighteen months. All the 8-inch were to be ready within two\r\nyears, and the 10-inch and larger calibres within two years and a\r\nhalf. The proposals opened on the 22d of last March showed that for\r\nthe gun-forgings the Cambria Iron Company had bid $851,513, the\r\nMidvale Steel Company $1,397,240, and the Bethlehem Iron Company\r\n$902,230; and that for the armor-plates the Bethlehem Company had\r\nbid $3,610,707, and the Cleveland Rolling-mill Company $4,021,561.\r\nSubsequently the Navy Department awarded the contract to the\r\nBethlehem Company, which agreed to furnish all the required steel at\r\na total cost of $4,512,938.29.\r\n\r\nThe tests are so rigorous that a high quality of steel is sure\r\nto be produced. The specifications require the forgings to be of\r\nopen-hearth steel of domestic manufacture, from the best quality of\r\nraw material, uniform in quality throughout the mass of each forging\r\nand throughout the whole order for forgings of the same calibre,\r\nand free from slag, seams, cracks, cavities, flaws, blow-holes,\r\nunsoundness, foreign substances, and all other defects affecting\r\ntheir resistance and value. While it is prescribed that the ingots\r\nshall be cast solid, latitude is given to the method of production;\r\nbut no matter what method may be employed, the part to be delivered\r\nfor test and acceptance must be equal in quality and in all other\r\nrespects to a gun ingot cast solid in the usual way, from which at\r\nleast 30 per cent. of the weight of the ingot has been discarded from\r\nthe upper end and 5 per cent. from the lower end.\r\n\r\nFor breech-pieces each ingot must be reduced in diameter by forging\r\nat least 40 per cent.; in case tubes are forged upon a mandrel from\r\nbored ingots, the walls must be reduced in thickness by forging at\r\nleast 50 per cent. Forgings are to be annealed, oil tempered under\r\nsuch conditions as will assure their resistance and again annealed,\r\nand no piece will be accepted unless the last process has been an\r\nannealing one. The forging must be left with a uniformly fine grain.\r\n\r\nAll these excellent results are the direct outcomes of the report\r\nmade in 1884 by the Ordnance Board. 1st. That the army and navy\r\nshould each have its own gun-factory; 2d. That the parts should be\r\nshipped by the steel-makers ready for finishing and assembling in\r\nguns; 3d. That the government should not undertake the production of\r\nsteel of its own accord; 4th. That the Watervliet Arsenal, West Troy,\r\nN. Y., should be the site of the army gun-factory; and 5th. That the\r\nWashington navy-yard should be the site of the navy gun-factory. No\r\naction was taken upon the recommendation to establish gun-factories;\r\nbut at the first session of the Forty-ninth Congress an appropriation\r\nof $1,000,000 was made for the armament of the navy, of which sum so\r\nmuch as the Secretary determined might be employed for the creation\r\nof a plant. Under this permission the gun-factory at the Washington\r\nnavy-yard is now being established.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the breech-loading steel guns for the new\r\ncruisers has been energetically pushed. Slight modifications in\r\nthe original designs were made necessary by the adoption of slower\r\nburning powder, which carried the pressure still farther forward\r\nin the bore, and, in the case of some foreign guns, caused their\r\ndestruction. Though our guns have not suffered from any such\r\naccident, it has been deemed a wise precaution to give the 8-inch\r\nguns of the _Atlanta_ two additional chase hoops, and to hoop all\r\nother pieces of this calibre to the muzzle.\r\n\r\nFrom a memorandum kindly furnished by Lieutenant Bradbury, United\r\nStates navy, it is learned that the number and calibre of the new\r\nguns now finished, under construction, or projected, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\r\n  |      NAME OF SHIP.     |                   Calibre.                 |\r\n  +------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |                        | 5-inch.| 6-inch.| 8-inch.|10-inch.|12-inch.|\r\n  | Dolphin                |  None. |   1    |  None. |  None. |  None. |\r\n  | Atlanta[53]            |    ”   |   6    |   2    |    ”   |    ”   |\r\n  | Boston[53]             |    ”   |   6    |   2    |    ”   |    ”   |\r\n  | Chicago[54]            |    2   |   8    |   4    |    ”   |    ”   |\r\n  | Gun-boat No. 1[54]     |  None. |   6    |  None. |    ”   |    ”   |\r\n  | Gun-boat No. 2         |    ”   |   4    |   ”    |    ”   |    ”   |\r\n  | Newark                 |    ”   |  12    |   ”    |    ”   |    ”   |\r\n  | Baltimore              |    ”   |   6    |   2    |    ”   |    ”   |\r\n  | Charleston             |    ”   |   6    |  None. |    2   |    ”   |\r\n  | Miantonomoh            |    ”   |  None. |   ”    |    4   |    ”   |\r\n  | Terror                 |    ”   |   ”    |   ”    |    4   |    ”   |\r\n  | Amphitrite             |    ”   |   ”    |   ”    |    4   |    ”   |\r\n  | Monadnock              |    ”   |   ”    |   ”    |    4   |    ”   |\r\n  | Puritan                |    ”   |   ”    |   ”    |    4   |    ”   |\r\n  | Armored cruiser        |    ”   |   6    |   ”    |    4   |    ”   |\r\n  | Armored battle-ship[55]|    ”   |   6    |   ”    |  None. |    2   |\r\n  | 2 Gun-boats            |    ”   |  12    |   ”    |    ”   |  None. |\r\n  | 2 Cruisers             |    ”   |  24[56]|   ”    |    ”   |    ”   |\r\n  | Floating batteries     |    ”   |  None. |   ”    |    ”   |   8[56]|\r\n  +------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nThis gives a total of two 5-inch, one hundred and three 6-inch, ten\r\n8-inch, twenty-six 10-inch, and ten 12-inch. In his last report,\r\nCaptain Sicard, Chief of Ordnance, states that “for the new ships\r\napproaching completion we have eighteen 6-inch, three 8-inch, and two\r\n5-inch guns finished, and three 6-inch and five 8-inch well advanced,\r\ntogether with all the carriages for the _Atlanta_ and _Boston_, and\r\nall for the _Chicago_, except the 8-inch....

Unfriendly critics vented their spite and\r\naired their ignorance in condemnations which included all who had\r\nhad anything to do, even in the remotest degree, with the design\r\nand construction of vessel and gun. Indeed, so bitter and persistent\r\nwere they that for a time it seemed almost hopeless to expect any\r\nfurther good could come out of the Nazareth of public opinion. It was\r\nnot a question of politics, for the journalists of every political\r\nfaith ran amuck riotously upon the subject; nor was it a matter\r\nof morals, where, through intelligent discussion, better things\r\ncould be attained, for with brilliant misinformation and dogmatic\r\ndulness each scribe stuck his pin-feathered goose-quill into the\r\nnavy’s midriff—it being such an easy, such a safe thing to do—and\r\nthen thanked Heaven he was a virtuous citizen. Finally, a board was\r\nappointed to inspect the ship and battery, and after a thorough\r\nexamination it made the following report:\r\n\r\n“In obedience to the Department’s order of the 22d instant, the Board\r\nconvened on board the _Atlanta_, Newport, Rhode Island, on the 25th\r\ninstant (July, 1887), and made a careful examination of the ship,\r\nguns, carriages, and fittings, and of the damage sustained during the\r\nrecent target practice, as reported by the board of officers ordered\r\nby the commanding officer of the _Atlanta_. The Board proceeded to\r\nsea on the morning of the 25th instant, but were prevented from\r\nfiring the guns by a heavy fog which prevailed throughout the day.\r\nThe ship was again taken to sea on the morning of the 27th instant,\r\nand the guns were fired. No deficiencies were noted in the guns\r\nthemselves other than a slight sticking of the breech-plug in 6-inch\r\nbreech-loading rifle No. 5 (this disappeared during the firing), some\r\ndifficulty in the management of the lock of 6-inch breech-loading\r\nrifle No. 4, caused by slight upsetting of the firing-pin, and the\r\nbending of the extractor in 6-pounder rapid-fire No. 5.\r\n\r\n“The recoil and counter-recoil of the 8 and 6 inch guns were easy and\r\nsatisfactory, except at the second fire of the 8-inch breech-loading\r\nrifle No. 1, when the gun remained in. (This was readily run out with\r\na tackle.) The action of the carriage of 8-inch breech-loading rifle\r\nNo. 1 at the first fire was due to want of strength in the clips and\r\nclip circles, and at the second fire to want of sufficient bearing\r\nand securing of the deck socket. It is believed that had the deck\r\nsocket held, the carriage would not have been disabled by the giving\r\nway of the clips. The training gear, steam and hand, was uninjured;\r\nthe gun was readily trained when run out to place. The action of the\r\nafter 6-inch shifting gun No. 4 was satisfactory, notwithstanding\r\nthat the front clips had a play of half an inch. The action of the\r\nbroadside carriages of 6-inch guns Nos. 5 and 18 was satisfactory,\r\nexcept the breaking of clips, the starting of the copper rivets in\r\nthe clip circles, and the wood screws in the training circles.\r\n\r\n“It is believed from the action of the carriage of 6-inch\r\nbreech-loading rifle No. 5, when the clips were removed, that the\r\ncarriages can be safety used without clips. The clips, however, give\r\nadditional security and steadiness to the carriage, and assist the\r\npivot and socket in bearing the shock of the discharge. The firing of\r\nthe 6-pounder rapid-fire guns developed a weakness in one leg of the\r\ncage mount of No. 4, due to imperfect workmanship, and showed also\r\nthe necessity of locking nuts on the bolts that secure the mounts\r\nto the ports. The tower mounts of the 3-pounder rapid-fire guns are\r\nunsatisfactory. They cannot be moved with facility; the line of\r\nsight of the gun is obstructed at ranges beyond 1600 yards, and the\r\nguns cannot be safely used as now fitted. For this reason 3-pounder\r\nrapid-fire No. 3 was not fired. The tripod mounts of the 1-pounder\r\nrapid-fire guns need stronger holding-down arrangements. The tower\r\nmounts of the 47-millimetre revolving cannon are like those of the\r\n3-pounder rapid-fire guns, and have the same defects. The mounts of\r\nthe 37-millimetre in the tops are satisfactory.\r\n\r\n“Careful observation of the effect of the firing upon the hull of the\r\nvessel failed to develop any damage other than the breaking of the\r\ncast-steel port-sills and the starting of some light wood-work. The\r\nshock of discharge was slight on the berth-deck, and observers there\r\nwere unable to observe which 6-inch gun had been fired. The deck,\r\nhull, and fittings, with the exception of the port-sills, hinges to\r\nsuperstructure doors and vegetable lockers, and some of the light\r\nwood-work, have every appearance of strength and ability to endure\r\nthe strain of continuous firing of the guns. The blast of the forward\r\n8-inch gun, when fired abaft the starboard beam, will not permit the\r\ncrews of the starboard 3-pounder rapid fire and 1-pounder rapid fire\r\nto remain at their guns. When the after 8-inch gun is fired forward\r\nof the port beam, the crews of the after 47-millimetre revolving\r\ncannon and of the port after 1-pounder rapid fire cannot remain at\r\ntheir guns. When the forward 6-inch shifting gun is fired on the port\r\nbow or directly ahead, the crew of forward 8-inch gun cannot remain\r\nat their places. When the after 6-inch shifting gun is fired on the\r\nstarboard quarter or directly aft, the crew of the after 8-inch\r\ngun cannot remain at their gun. The inability to fire parts of the\r\nsecondary battery under certain conditions is due to the great arc of\r\nfire given to the 8-inch guns. This can hardly be called a defect. It\r\nis thought that a screen can be placed between the 8 and 6 inch guns\r\nwhich will enable them to be worked together forward or aft.\r\n\r\n“The pivot socket of the 8-inch carriage should have a broader\r\nbearing surface, and should be rigidly bolted to the steel deck and\r\nto the framework of the ship in such manner as to distribute the\r\nstrain over a larger area. The clips and clip circles of the 8-inch\r\nand 6-inch carriage should be made of steel. The clips should have\r\nlarger bearing surfaces, and should be shaped to fit the circle. The\r\ncircle should have double flanges, and be bolted (not riveted) on\r\neach flange to the steel deck. There should be no appreciable play\r\nbetween the clips and the circles. All bolts used in the battery\r\nfittings should have the nuts locked.\r\n\r\n“The clip rail of the tower mount should be altered to fit the mount.\r\nThis change will make the compressors effective, and allow the guns\r\nto be used with safety. The port-sills should be replaced by heavier\r\nsills, made of the best quality of malleable cast-steel. The plan of\r\ntesting the hull, guns, and fittings of the _Atlanta_ arranged by the\r\nBoard contemplated a more extended use of the main battery, but the\r\nweakness developed in the port-sills and in the sockets of the 8-inch\r\ncarriages rendered further firing inadvisable.”\r\n\r\nWhatever conclusion may be drawn from this report, there is one fact\r\nwhich may serve as an important corollary. In the latest drills\r\nof the ships on the North Atlantic station, the _Atlanta_ won the\r\nchampion pennant for the best gunnery practice, and this with guns\r\nand carriages which were said to be completely disabled.\r\n\r\nThe safe employment of high explosives for war purposes is looked\r\nupon by many as a solution of certain vexed problems, and much time\r\nand money have been given to the subject. From the nitro-glycerine\r\nproducts there has been a loudly heralded advance to melinite and\r\nroborite, of which the great things expected have not yet been\r\nrealized. Among the most promising attempts to use dynamite in\r\na projectile is that made with the pneumatic gun, perfected by\r\nLieutenant Zalinski, of the U. S. Artillery, who has courteously\r\nfurnished the following description of the system:\r\n\r\n“The pneumatic dynamite torpedo gun is a weapon which has been\r\nevolved for the purpose of projecting with safety and accuracy very\r\nlarge charges of the high explosives. While a gun in name and form,\r\nit is practically a torpedo-projecting machine, the propelling force\r\nused being compressed air. The use of the compressed air gives\r\nuniformity and complete control of pressures and total absence of\r\nheat. This insures entire absence of violent initial shocks from\r\nthe propelling force; it also eliminates danger of increasing the\r\nnormal sensitiveness of the high explosives by heating while resting\r\nin the bore of the gun. The ability to reproduce, time after time,\r\nabsolutely the same pressure necessarily carries with it great\r\naccuracy of fire. The torpedo shell thrown by the gun is essentially\r\narrow-like, and is very light and compact compared to the weight of\r\ncharge thrown. This is a matter of no little importance on shipboard,\r\nas a very much larger number can therefore be carried for a given\r\nweight and storage room. The torpedoes projected by this machine\r\nhave a twofold field of action when acting against ships: first, the\r\nover-water hull, second, the under-water hull.\r\n\r\n“The shell is exploded by an electrical fuse. This is brought into\r\naction if striking the over-water hull an instant _before_ full\r\nimpact. If the shell misses the over-water hull and enters the\r\nwater, explosion is produced _after_ the shell is thoroughly buried,\r\nthus obtaining the fullest tamping effect of the water. The delayed\r\naction of the fuse can be controlled so as to cause the shell to go\r\nto the bottom before explosion ensues. This is needed at times when\r\nthe torpedo shell is used for counter-mining a system of submerged\r\nstationary torpedo defences.\r\n\r\n“Experiments against iron plates have shown that it is essential to\r\nhave the initial point of explosion at the rear of the shell. When\r\nexplosion takes place by simple impact from the front end, the injury\r\nto the plates is actually less than when a blank shell is used.\r\n\r\n“For these reasons the fuse has been arranged so that the initial\r\npoint of explosion is at the _rear_ of the shell. No attempt has been\r\nmade to make a shell which can perforate armor before explosion. To\r\ndo so would involve thickening the walls to such an extent as to\r\nmaterially reduce the weight of the charge carried. Besides that, it\r\nis very doubtful whether a shell fully charged with gunpowder can\r\nperforate any considerable thickness of armor without previously\r\nexploding its bursting charge. Much more will this be the case where\r\nthe bursting charge is one of the more sensitive high explosives.\r\n\r\n“The pneumatic torpedo-gun system has various fields of usefulness as\r\nan auxiliary war appliance. Among these are the following:\r\n\r\n“1st. On swift-moving torpedo-boats; 2d. On larger war-vessels,\r\nfor general use and for defence against surface and submarine\r\ntorpedo-boats; 3d. In land defences; 4th. For use in the approaches\r\nduring land sieges.\r\n\r\n“Torpedo-boats carrying the pneumatic guns can commence effective\r\noperations at the range of at least one mile, as compared to not\r\nmore than three hundred yards of the boats carrying the Whitehead\r\ntorpedoes. Their torpedo shell cannot be stopped by netting, as is\r\nthe case with the latter. The charges which can be thrown are also\r\nmuch greater. The guns to be carried on the pneumatic dynamite-gun\r\ncruiser now building for the United States government will throw\r\nshell charged with 200 and 400 pounds of explosive gelatine. These\r\nguns can be fired at the rate of one in two minutes, and indeed even\r\nmore rapidly if required.\r\n\r\n“In the defence of a man-of-war no other means can as effectually\r\nstop the advance either of submarine boats or submerged movable\r\ntorpedoes. This is due to the ability to explode the large charges\r\nwhen the shells are well submerged. Their radius of action will be so\r\ngreat as to avoid the necessity of making absolute hits. The chances\r\nof stopping the attack are thereby very much increased.\r\n\r\n“A tube of large calibre can be fixed in the bow, so as to be of\r\nuse when advancing to the attack with the ram. An 18-inch shell,\r\ncontaining 1000 pounds of explosive gelatine, can be thrown 500\r\nyards in advance of the ship, and that, too, without danger of\r\nrunning into the explosion of its own petard, as would be the case in\r\nejecting directly ahead ordinary torpedoes. This will be made more\r\nclear by the statement of the relative speed of the two classes. The\r\npneumatic-gun torpedo has a mean velocity of 400 knots for a range\r\nof one mile, as compared to 25 knots for a range of 200 yards of\r\nthe Whitehead torpedo. Furthermore, there is no danger of the shell\r\nturning back, as is sometimes the case with the latter.\r\n\r\n“The opportunities of making an effective hit will be much greater\r\nwith the torpedo shell than with the ram; it will be easier to point\r\nthe vessel fairly at the enemy’s broadside when at the range of\r\nfive hundred yards than to bring the ram in absolute contact with\r\nthe enemy’s side. The gun-tubes used are very thin (not exceeding\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in thickness), and may be of sections of\r\nany convenient length. The other portions of the supporting truss,\r\nreservoirs, etc., are also of comparatively light weight. They could\r\nbe of large calibres, and the destructive effects producible by large\r\ncharges of high explosives will doubtless have a demoralizing effect\r\nupon the defence.”\r\n\r\nUpon September 20th of this year a public trial was successfully made\r\nwith the gun, the target being the condemned coast survey schooner\r\n_Silliman_. After firing two shots to verify the range, the gun was\r\nloaded with a projectile which was five and a half feet in length,\r\ncontained fifty-five pounds of explosive gelatine, and was fired\r\nunder an air pressure of 607 pounds. The torpedo rushed from the\r\nmuzzle of the tube with a loud report; in thirteen seconds it plunged\r\ninto the water close under the starboard quarter of the _Silliman_,\r\nand exploding almost instantly, threw a great volume of water one\r\nhundred and fifty feet into the air.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the schooner was hidden from view, but when the mist\r\ncleared away it was found that her main-mast had toppled over the\r\nside. At a distance this seemed to be all the damage inflicted, but\r\na closer inspection showed that all the wood-ends on deck had been\r\nloosened, that the cabin fittings had been thoroughly shaken up, and\r\nthat water was running into the hold.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards a fourth shot was fired. This landed very close to\r\nthe starboard side of the vessel, and on explosion seemed to lift the\r\n_Silliman_ out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe hull was very badly shattered; the water-tank, which had been\r\nfirmly fastened to the schooner’s bottom, was blown up through the\r\ndeck and floated on the wreckage, and the stump of the main-mast\r\nwas capsized. The bow was held above water by barrel buoys, and the\r\nfore-mast, which had heeled over to an angle of forty-five degrees,\r\nwas sustained by the steel rigging that had become entangled in the\r\npieces of wood floating to windward.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINE AND RAPID-FIRE GUNS.\r\n\r\nOf the machine guns, the Gatling, Gardner, Nordenfeldt, and Maxim\r\nsystems are the best known. The adoption of the Accles feed in the\r\nGatling eliminates largely the liability of cartridge jams, and\r\nincreases the rapidity of fire at all angles to twelve hundred shots\r\nper minute; when this rapid delivery of fire is not needed, Bruce’s\r\nslower feed may be substituted. The Gardner gun is an effective\r\nweapon, but it has less rapidity of fire and smaller range of\r\nvertical train than the Gatling. The Nordenfeldt rifle-calibre gun\r\nhas not obtained the prominence of the others, and the Maxim, in\r\nwhich the energy of recoil is ingeniously applied to the work of\r\nloading and firing, is growing in favor. The Hotchkiss revolving\r\ncannon was a wonderful step—the 37, 47, and 53 millimetre calibres\r\nfiring 1 pound, 2½ pound, and 3½ pound explosive projectiles, with\r\nmuzzle velocities of about 1400 feet per second. “The heavier nature\r\nof revolving cannon,” declares Commander Folger, United States Navy,\r\n“proved somewhat unwieldy, and the change to the single barrel of\r\nincreased length, and using a heavier powder charge, was a natural\r\none, and in keeping with the growing ballistic power of large guns.\r\nThough no longer denominated machine guns, the term now being\r\ngenerally applied to a cluster of barrels, the rapid-fire guns are\r\na direct outgrowth of the larger calibres of machine guns, and are\r\nclassed with them as secondary battery arms. There are now in the\r\nservice of all the great military powers rapid-firing guns of 47\r\nand 57 millimetre calibre, firing respectively explosive shells of\r\n3 pounds and 6 pounds weight, at muzzle velocity of about 1900 feet\r\nper second. This will give with the 6-pound gun a range of about\r\n2½ miles at 10 degrees elevation. These guns will deliver, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, perhaps ten aimed rounds per minute, and the\r\nshells perforating the sides of an unarmored vessel, and bursting,\r\nafter passing through into, say, twenty-five fragments, each with\r\nenergy sufficient to kill a man, we have here a weapon of unequalled\r\ndestructive capacity. It is beyond question that the conditions of\r\ncombat between ships and forts are definitely changed by the advent\r\nof these guns. Even armored vessels with covered batteries are at\r\na disadvantage, as a hail of missiles will seek the gun-ports and\r\nconning-towers wherever an enemy, from the nature of circumstances,\r\ntakes close quarters. Experiment abroad has also demonstrated that\r\nthe projecting chase (forward body) of a large gun is extremely\r\nvulnerable, and liable to injury from the fire of the larger\r\nrapid-firing pieces.\r\n\r\n“This system, which is just now so important an adjunct to the main\r\nbattery of ships of war, is of but recent development. The first\r\norder received for a weapon of this kind by the Hotchkiss firm came\r\nfrom the United States, and the guns now mounted in the new ships\r\n_Boston_, _Atlanta_, and _Dolphin_ were delivered under it. Three\r\ncalibres were obtained, _viz._, the 6, 3, and 1 pounder, as they\r\nare known in the United States navy, their usual names in other\r\ncountries being the 57, 47, and 37 millimetre guns. Since their\r\nintroduction the demand for larger calibres by most of the prominent\r\nnaval powers has been so pressing that the Hotchkiss Company has\r\nproduced a 9-pounder and has a 33-pounder in course of manufacture.\r\nIt is believed that this last calibre represents about the limit of\r\nutility of the Hotchkiss system, though the gain in time by the use\r\nof ammunition carrying the charge projectile and fulminate in one\r\ncase will recommend it for use with much larger calibres, even where\r\ntwo men may be required to handle the cartridge.”\r\n\r\nThe most important trials of rapid-fire guns during the past two\r\nyears are thus described by Lieutenant Driggs, United States navy:\r\n\r\n“The various systems now in use, or being developed, are the\r\nAlbini, Armstrong, Driggs-Schroeder, Gruson, Hotchkiss, Krupp,\r\nMaxim, Nordenfeldt. Of these the Armstrong has not been favorably\r\nreceived on account of the cumbersome breech-closing arrangement.\r\nThis consists in two side levers attached to and turning about the\r\ntrunnions; a cross-head connects the two levers, and by an eccentric\r\nmotion one of them is pressed against or removed from the breech of\r\nthe gun, thus closing or opening it. The _Bausan_ has two of those\r\nguns, but with that known exception few, if any, have been put in\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n“The Gruson gun is said to be very similar to the Hotchkiss in its\r\nmechanism, though not as good. The Maxim and Hotchkiss are both well\r\nknown. The Nordenfeldt, which in Europe is the greatest rival of the\r\nHotchkiss, is entirely different from the guns heretofore made under\r\nthis name. In the single-shot rapid-fire gun the breech is closed\r\nwith a double breech-plug, which is revolved in the breech recess\r\nby a cam motion. The plug is divided transversely; the front half\r\ncarries the firing-pin, and has only a circular motion in closing\r\nand opening; the rear half acts as a wedge, the first motion being\r\ndownward and the second circular, the front half then moving with it.\r\n\r\n“One of the most complete tests to which guns of this class have been\r\nsubjected was that conducted by the Italian government in February\r\nof last year (1885). The trials were made at Spezia, the following\r\nbeing offered for test: Hotchkiss rapid-fire; improved Nordenfeldt\r\nrapid-fire on recoil-carriage; Armstrong rapid-fire; and a rapid-fire\r\ngun made at the Government Works at Venice. The Armstrong gun was not\r\nfired; the others were fired in the following order: Nordenfeldt,\r\nHotchkiss, and Italian.\r\n\r\n“The guns were mounted on board a small ship (the _Vulcano_) for\r\nfiring at sea. A large target was fixed on the breakwater in the\r\nmiddle of the harbor of Spezia, and two smaller targets of triangular\r\nshape had been anchored, one 550 yards inside, and the other 550\r\nyards outside, the breakwater. The _Vulcano_ was then placed 1300\r\nto 1400 yards inside the breakwater, and fire begun against the\r\nlarge target with the Nordenfeldt 6-pounder gun, which was worked\r\nby Italian sailors. A first series of eighteen shots were fired\r\nin forty-seven seconds, for rapidity of fire with rough aiming. A\r\nsecond series of sixteen shots were fired in thirty-four seconds.\r\nThe rapidity of fire with rough aiming and untried men was thus\r\nrespectively at the rate of twenty-three and twenty-eight shots per\r\nminute. Afterwards, ten case-shots were fired with the gun almost\r\nlevel, in order to see how the lead bullets were spread over the\r\nrange. Some of them were seen to touch the water 700 or 800 yards\r\nfrom the muzzle, and the whole range was well covered by the 150 lead\r\nbullets contained in each of the Nordenfeldt case-shots.\r\n\r\n“The second part of the programme consisted of the firing at three\r\ntargets, respectively at 600, 1200, and 1800 yards, the ranges being\r\nonly approximately known, changing the aim at every third shot,\r\nand firing under difficulty, owing to the movement of the ship.\r\nTwenty-one common shells were fired, seven at each target, with good\r\naccuracy, and the shells on striking the water burst better at the\r\nshorter than at the longer ranges.\r\n\r\n“The firing at sea was closed with one more series of ten rounds,\r\nfired rapidly in twenty-six seconds, in order to see if the gun\r\nwould act well after being heated by the eighty-five rounds which\r\nhad already been fired. Four of the last series were ring-shells,\r\nand burst on striking the water at the first impact, breaking into a\r\nlarger number of pieces than the common shells. The Nordenfeldt gun\r\nwas then mounted on shore for tests of penetration. The plates used\r\nwere: (1) a 5¼-inch solid wrought-iron; (2) a 4-inch solid (Cammell)\r\nsteel plate; (3) one ⅞-inch steel plate, at an angle of fifteen\r\ndegrees to line of fire. The two thick plates were backed by ten\r\ninches of oak, and at right angles to line of fire and one hundred\r\nyards from the gun. The perforation was in every case complete, both\r\nwith solid steel shot and chilled-point shells, these latter bursting\r\nin the wood behind. The thin plate was then put at more acute angle\r\nto the line of fire, and only when this angle was seven degrees or\r\neight degrees did the projectile fail to penetrate. The indicated\r\nmuzzle velocity of this gun is 2130 feet, with a 6-pound projectile\r\nand charge of two pounds fifteen ounces.\r\n\r\n“A few days afterwards the Hotchkiss gun went through the same trials\r\nand programme. For rapidity forty rounds were fired with rough aiming\r\nin three minutes, the rate being 13.3 per minute. The shooting was\r\ngood, but the men serving the gun complained of being fatigued by\r\nthe shocks from the shoulder-piece. The muzzle velocity was about\r\n1085 feet, or about 300 feet below that of the Nordenfeldt. Last of\r\nall, the Italian gun was fired, but as it was designed for 1480 feet\r\nvelocity, it was not brought in direct competition with the other\r\ntwo guns in power. The rapidity of fire obtained, however, was about\r\ntwenty rounds per minute, and both the mechanism and recoil-carriage\r\nworked well.[57]\r\n\r\n“The Hotchkiss and Nordenfeldt guns were tried in competition at\r\nOchta, near St. Petersburg, in September last (1886). The reports\r\nthat have reached this country are very meagre, but are unanimous\r\nin favor of the Nordenfeldt gun. From what can be learned, the fire\r\nwas first for rapidity, in which the Nordenfeldt discharged thirty\r\nrounds in one minute, and the Hotchkiss twenty rounds in the same\r\ntime, the initial velocity of the former being 624 metres (2047 feet)\r\nper second, while that of the latter was 548 metres (1797 feet) per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n“The fire of both guns was directed upon a target at 1800 metres\r\n(1969 yards) range. The Nordenfeldt scored nine hits, while the\r\nHotchkiss made none. It is more than likely that this failure was due\r\nmore to defective pointing than to any defect of construction.\r\n\r\n“The trial closed with a very interesting and instructive experiment.\r\n\r\n“Four targets were placed at 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 metres; each\r\ngun was to fire as rapidly as possible for thirty seconds, changing\r\nthe range each fire, from the 600 up to the 1200 metre target and\r\nback. During this test the Nordenfeldt is said to have discharged\r\nfifteen shots in the thirty seconds, and to have made nine hits,\r\nwhile the Hotchkiss scored but two hits and only discharged eleven\r\nrounds in thirty-two seconds. Here again the element of inaccurate\r\nsighting may be largely responsible for the difference in the number\r\nof hits, but the great disparity in the number of rounds fired must\r\nbe due to the mechanical defects in the Hotchkiss system by which the\r\naction of its breech-block is too slow. Notwithstanding the reported\r\nsuccess of the Nordenfeldt gun in the trials, the Russian government\r\nordered a number of Hotchkiss guns and no Nordenfeldts.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW 6-INCH BREECH-LOADING RIFLE.]\r\n\r\nThe latest experiments with large calibred rapid-fire guns were\r\nthose of the Armstrong 36 and 70 pounder. The first piece differs\r\nmaterially from the new 33-pounder Hotchkiss; it is 4.724 inches in\r\ncalibre, 14 feet 2½ inches length, and weighs 34 hundred-weight.\r\nIt was fired with seven and a half pounds of powder ten times\r\nin forty-seven seconds, or at a rate six times faster than that\r\nobtained with the service guns of like calibre. The 70-pounder was\r\nfired with both twenty-five-pound and thirty-pound charges, at a\r\nspeed of from eight to ten rounds per minute. In the latest mount\r\nfor the 36-pounder the gun is supported on a rocking slide which\r\npivots on transverse bearings, so that the piece moves only forward\r\nand backward on the slide; elevation and depression are given by a\r\nshoulder-piece attached to the slide, and the gun is secured at any\r\ndesired angle with a clamp attached to the side of the slide.\r\n\r\nThis development of rapid-fire pieces opens anew the discussion\r\nas to the comparative values of large and small calibre guns. At\r\nthe present stage of the question it is safe to say that, however\r\nnecessary the large calibre may be in armored battle-ships and\r\ncoast-defence vessels, its usefulness in thin-skinned, high-powered\r\ncruisers is questionable. Abroad, the long-range guns which\r\nconstitute the primary batteries are being reduced in calibre, while\r\nthe secondary batteries of rapid-fire guns are increasing so much in\r\nsize that before the next sea-war a nearly uniform calibre of four or\r\nfive inches will probably be established.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for these changes are not difficult to understand. In\r\nall sea engagements hereafter type will fight with type; that is\r\nto say, apart from the rôle which auxiliary rams and torpedo-boats\r\nmay play, armored ships will oppose armored ships, and unarmored\r\ncruisers and gun-boats will, when intelligently handled, seek action\r\nonly with vessels of similar character. To-day every unarmored\r\nship afloat or under construction can be penetrated at the average\r\nfighting distance by a musket-bullet impelled with a little more than\r\nthe ordinary velocity; and as there is absolutely no protection, it\r\nseems a mistake to arm such vessels with the unnecessarily large\r\ncalibres now in use. Especially is this true when their employment\r\nis based mainly upon the remote assumption that such ships may have\r\nto attack fortifications. Smaller guns will do the work equally as\r\nwell, if not better; for the greater intensity of fire secured by the\r\ncertain action of a large number of easily handled small-calibred\r\nguns is surely more valuable than any probable advantage which might\r\nbe derived from heavier projectiles fired under conditions that make\r\ntheir effectiveness doubtful.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said to the contrary by mere theorists, the\r\ndifficulty of handling ordnance increases enormously as the calibres\r\ngrow; and sea-officers, who alone are the proper judges, insist that\r\nthe monster pieces of the present day are so unmanageable as to\r\nbe nearly useless. Of course, where armor penetration is vital to\r\nsuccess, heavy armaments must and will be employed; but when this\r\nfactor need not be considered, a great many light guns, easily worked\r\nby hand, are the demands of the hour. The problem, fortunately, is\r\nnearer solution owing to the development now in progress; and when\r\nthis is coupled with the rapidly increasing popularity of the 5-inch\r\nbreech-loading all-steel rifle, our country notably may congratulate\r\nitself that ordnance is reverting to a plane which other nations\r\nmistakenly and at great cost abandoned, and which the United States\r\ncan readily attain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPS OF THE MINOR NAVIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in September of this year there sailed from England for the\r\nEast five Chinese war-vessels of the latest types: the _Chih Yüan_\r\nand _Ching Yüan_, fast cruisers; the _King Yüan_ and _Lai Yüan_,\r\ncoast-defence ships; and a torpedo-boat as yet unnamed. Though the\r\nsquadron was commanded by Admiral Lang, a captain in the Royal\r\nNavy temporarily serving under the Chinese government, the other\r\nofficers were mainly, and the crews were wholly, natives who had\r\npassed through English cruising and training ships. The _Chih Yüan_\r\nwas commanded by Captain Tang, who had under him nine English and\r\nfifteen Chinese officers and one hundred and fifty men; the _Ching\r\nYüan_ was in charge of Captain Yih, and eleven English and fourteen\r\nChinese officers, with the same complement; while the other ships\r\nwere officered and manned much the same way. There was, it is true,\r\nan English fleet surgeon, but each ship had its native medical\r\nofficer and two chief engineers, one of whom was a Chinese. “On\r\nleaving Spithead,” stated the _Herald_ cable despatch, “the fleet\r\nwill proceed direct to Gibraltar, thence to Port Said, where it will\r\ntake in coal; it will stop at Suez, Aden, Colombo (where it will coal\r\nagain), Singapore, Hong-Kong, Chefoo, and Taku, joining at this place\r\nthe fleet already assembled under Admiral Ting, and replacing there\r\nmany of the foreigners by native officers. The voyage is expected to\r\noccupy seventy-two days—fifty-two at sea and twenty in harbor—and\r\nduring this time the crews will be thoroughly practised in torpedo,\r\ngun, and other drills. This, of course, will involve a deal of hard\r\nwork, such as would try the endurance of English sailors, but the\r\nChinamen will be allowed a plentiful supply of beef and beer.”\r\n\r\nModern cruisers and armed battle-ships requiring the highest\r\nintelligence to fight, torpedo-drills, beef and beer—and all for\r\nthat outer barbarian whom our mobs murder just for a lark! Here is\r\na lesson for Congressmen; here an example and a possible menace for\r\nthis defenceless land.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese navy, though of recent growth, consists to-day of seven\r\narmored and ten unarmored ships of modern types, in addition to\r\ntorpedo-boats, and to at least thirty other vessels which are not so\r\nobsolete as nine-tenths of the ships this country has in commission.\r\n\r\nNearly ten years ago the Chinese government realized that its\r\nwooden corvettes, gun-boats, and armed junks were no longer adapted\r\nto warfare, and ordered from the Vulcan Works at Stettin the two\r\nsteel cruisers _Nan Shu_ and _Nan Shen_. These are of 2200 tons\r\ndisplacement, and with 2400 horse-power have developed 15 knots\r\nspeed; their armament is composed of two 8-inch and eight 4½-inch\r\nArmstrongs, and of lighter secondary pieces. In 1881 these ships\r\nwere followed by the armored battle-ships _Chen Yüan_ and _Ting\r\nYüan_, and by the steel cruiser _Tchi Yüan_. The battle-ships are\r\nbuilt of steel, and have the following dimensions: length 296.5\r\nfeet, beam 59 feet, mean draught 20 feet, displacement 7430 tons.\r\nTheir compound armor extends throughout a central citadel 138 feet\r\nlong, and around a nearly elliptical redoubt situated at its forward\r\nend; the side armor is five feet wide, and has a thickness of 14\r\ninches at the water-line, of 8 inches at the lower and of 10 inches\r\nat the upper edge; the protection to the redoubt is 12, and to the\r\nconning-tower 8, inches thick. The armament consists of four 12-inch\r\nKrupps, echeloned in pairs within the redoubt; of two 5.9-inch\r\nKrupps mounted forward and aft inside of machine-gun proof turrets;\r\nof eleven Hotchkiss revolving cannons, and a supply of Whitehead\r\ntorpedo-tubes. The engines are of the three-cylinder compound type,\r\nand develop 7300 horse-power and 15.5 knots. The ships have double\r\nbottoms, minutely subdivided, and in addition to a cork belt forward\r\nand abaft the citadel a steel protective deck two inches thick curves\r\nto the extremities. The twin-screw steel cruiser _Tchi Yüan_ is of\r\n3200 tons displacement, and has two sets of two-cylinder horizontal\r\ncompound engines, which develop 2800 horse-power and a speed of 15\r\nknots; her dimensions are: length 236 feet 3 inches, beam 34 feet 5\r\ninches, and draught 15 feet 9 inches. The entire under-water body is\r\ncovered by a curved steel deck, which is 4 inches thick, and extends\r\n4 feet 9 inches below the water-line; the space between this deck and\r\nthe one above is used for coal-bunkers. “There are two machine-gun\r\nproof turrets on the fore and aft line, the base of the forward one\r\nbeing surmounted by a fixed tower armored with 15-inch steel, which\r\nextends to a height sufficient to protect the base of the turret,\r\nits machinery, and gun-carriages. The armament is composed of two\r\n8.27-inch (21 centimetre) Krupps in the forward turret, of one\r\n5.9-inch (15 centimetre) Krupp in the after turret, of two similar\r\nguns on the main deck aft, of five Hotchkiss revolving cannons,\r\nand of a supply of Whitehead torpedoes, discharged through four\r\nabove-water tubes.”[58]\r\n\r\nThe swift protected cruisers _Chih Yüan_ and _Ching Yüan_ were built\r\nat Elswick; the unnamed torpedo-boat is of the _Yarrow_ type; and the\r\ncoast-defence vessels _King Yüan_ and _Lai Yüan_ were constructed at\r\nStettin. The displacement of the cruisers is 2300 tons, length 268\r\nfeet, beam 38 feet, depth 21 feet, and draught 14 feet forward and 16\r\nfeet aft. Each vessel has two pairs of triple-expansion engines. Both\r\nthe engine and boiler rooms are divided into water-tight compartments\r\nby transverse and longitudinal bulkheads, and the machinery is so\r\narranged that either boiler can work on one engine or on both, and\r\nthe change necessary to effect this can be made while the vessel is\r\nin motion. The result of this intercommunication between each engine\r\nand each boiler is that the vessel can proceed so long as any single\r\nboiler and engine are uninjured.\r\n\r\nIn the four trial trips, two with and two against the tide, with all\r\ntheir weights, armament, and Chinese crews on board, they attained an\r\naverage speed of 18.536 knots.\r\n\r\nThe vessels are built of steel, and have two decks, the lower one\r\nconsisting of four-inch steel plates, rising in the middle above\r\nthe water-line and inclined at the sides so as to dip below it.\r\nThe engines, magazines, rudder-head, and steering gear lie below,\r\nand are protected by this deck. The openings in the deck are\r\nencircled by coffer-dams, armored with steel plates, inclined so as\r\nto deflect projectiles. The bows are formed and strengthened for\r\nramming purposes. Additional protection is given to the vessel by\r\na partition which is built on the protective deck parallel to the\r\nside of the ship; this encloses a space that is eight feet wide, and\r\nis subdivided into a great number of water-tight compartments for\r\nthe stowage of four hundred and fifty tons of fuel. Both ships have\r\ndouble bottoms, minutely subdivided into water-tight compartments.\r\n\r\nThe armament consists of three 21-centimetre Krupp guns—two mounted\r\nforward and one aft—all on centre-pivot, shield-protected Vavasseur\r\ncarriages; of two 6-inch Armstrongs on sponsons, also Vavasseur\r\nmounted; of eight 6-pounder rapid-fire Hotchkiss; and of six Gatling\r\nguns. There are four above-water torpedo-tubes—two fixed (one in the\r\nbow, firing ahead, and one aft, pointed astern) and two training, one\r\nin each broadside.\r\n\r\nThere are two electric search-lights for each vessel, with a nominal\r\npower of 25,000 candles, while the cabins and rest of the ship are\r\nlighted with incandescent lamps.\r\n\r\n“It is humiliating,” writes the _Army and Navy Gazette_, “but\r\nnevertheless an actual fact, that two of the cruisers of the\r\nChinese squadron under command of Admiral Lang are superior in\r\ncertain novelties of construction to any of our own vessels of this\r\nclass. In point of speed the two unarmored ships which have been\r\nturned out by the Elswick firm cannot be touched by our swiftest\r\ncruisers. They steam nearly nineteen knots an hour. The traversing\r\nand manipulation of their guns can be effected with such rapidity\r\nthat when saluting the garrison at Portsmouth recently it appeared\r\nalmost impossible that the guns could have been properly sponged\r\nbetween each discharge, the two bow guns especially keeping up\r\na continuous roar. Only the two sponson 6-inch guns are from\r\nArmstrong’s; they are mounted on Vavasseur carriages, and fitted\r\nwith singularly simple breech apparatus. The other three heavy guns\r\nare Krupp’s 21-centimetres (about 8¼-inch). These last are protected\r\nwith a shield of entirely unique construction. It is of steel, and\r\ncommencing from the trunnion ring spreads out into a wide shelter\r\nsufficient to accommodate the entire gun detachment. The sights are\r\nalso under cover. The stern-chaser has a single shield; the two\r\nbow-chasers are included within one. The torpedo apparatus is most\r\ncomplete. In addition to the two tubes opening ahead and astern,\r\nwhich are well above the surface of the water, there are six others\r\nin connection with the torpedo-room.\r\n\r\n“But the latest improvement which is observable on board is the\r\nsteel armored conning-tower, fitted with Lord Armstrong’s patent\r\ntelegraph and communications, for which a special royalty of four\r\nhundred pounds has to be paid. It is the most perfect scheme for\r\nconducting fighting operations that has ever come under our notice. A\r\nmodel for laying all the guns is prominently placed in front of the\r\nsteering-wheel, which is under personal command of the officer in\r\ncharge. On the left are tubes and telegraphs by which he can converse\r\nwith the officer in command of the gun detachment, and correct any\r\nmistakes observable in the laying of the guns. Then he can fire\r\nsimultaneously, if desirable, or singly, if preferred. All stations\r\non board are also in communication with this conning-tower. Hence the\r\nentire fighting power of the vessel, torpedoes and all included, is\r\nat the disposal of the officer in command within the conning-tower.\r\nAnother useful modification has been effected in these vessels. The\r\nconning-tower, which is at the foot of the foremost fighting mast,\r\nhas close to it the signal station, also protected with steel armor,\r\nso that the signaller therein is absolutely secure, and close to the\r\ncommanding officer, from whom he receives and to whom he communicates\r\noutside signals.”\r\n\r\nThe torpedo-boat built by Yarrow is said to be the fastest of its\r\nsize that has ever been launched, as it has reached a speed of about\r\ntwenty-eight knots an hour. It is armed with two fixed 14-inch\r\ntorpedo-tubes in the bows, and one 14-inch training-tube on deck\r\nabaft the funnel. It is also supplied with a powerful armament of\r\nHotchkiss and Gatling guns, and a strong electric search-light so\r\narranged as to be worked either from the conning-tower or from the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nThe _King Yüan_ and _Lai Yüan_, built by the Vulcan Company at\r\nStettin, are powerful vessels, effective for either coast defence or\r\ndistant sea service. Their principal dimensions are: length 269 feet,\r\nbeam 39 feet 4 inches, depth 25 feet 6 inches, mean draught 16 feet 8\r\ninches, and displacement 2900 tons. They are built entirely of steel,\r\nwith double bottoms extending two-thirds of the length, and the\r\nunder-water body is divided by bulkheads into sixty-six water-tight\r\ncompartments. The armor protection is compound, and consists of a\r\nbelt six feet wide extending the length of the machinery and boiler\r\nspace, having a maximum thickness of 9.5 inches at and above the\r\nwater-line, and a minimum thickness of 5.1 inches. This belt is\r\nterminated at either end by thwartship armored bulkheads, 5.1 inches\r\nthick. At the forward end of the belt is a circular revolving turret\r\neight inches thick, on top of which is the conning-tower, with an\r\narmor protection of six inches. The under-water body is protected\r\nby a complete steel protective deck, 1.5 inches thick over the top\r\nof, and three inches thick forward and abaft, the belt. A partial\r\ncork belt above the protective deck gives additional stability. The\r\nengines consist of two sets of three-cylinder compound type, situated\r\nin two separate compartments, driving twin screws, and developing\r\n3400 horse-power with forced draft. The boilers, four in number, are\r\nplaced in two separate compartments. A speed of about sixteen knots\r\nwas attained. The armament consists of two 21-centimetre (8.27-inch)\r\nKrupps mounted in the turret; of two 15-centimetre (5.91-inch)\r\nsimilar guns carried in recessed ports; of two 47-millimetre\r\nHotchkiss rapid-fire guns; of five 37-millimetre revolving cannons;\r\nand of four torpedo-discharging tubes—three above-water and one in\r\nthe bow below the water-line.[59]\r\n\r\nAs additions to the lightly armored gun-boat _Tiong Sing_, built\r\nin 1875, China ordered this year from the Vulcan Company two heavy\r\ncoast-defence vessels of 7000 tons displacement and 6000 horse-power,\r\nand laid down at Foochow an armored gun-vessel. The _Tshao Yong_\r\nand _Yang Wai_ are steel cruisers built at Elswick, of 1350 tons\r\ndisplacement and 2400 horse-power; they have developed sixteen knots,\r\nand are armed with two 10-inch and four 4½-inch Armstrongs, with a\r\nsecondary battery of two lighter pieces and six machine guns. The\r\n_Fee-chen_, a small steel cruiser built at Sunderland, England, has\r\ntriple-expansion engines, and is expected to develop thirteen knots.\r\nHer armament consists of two 6-inch Armstrongs and four lighter guns;\r\nshe is also fitted to do cable work. Three cruisers of the _Nan Shu_\r\ntype are being constructed in Chinese dockyards, besides several of\r\nthe _Kuang Chen_ class of gun-boats.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese navy consists of forty vessels, of which eight only are\r\nmodern. The classified armored fleet includes five ships, among them\r\nthe _Adsama Kan_, formerly known as the _Stonewall Jackson_; none\r\nof these is of any importance except the central battery ship _Fu\r\nSoo_, which was launched in 1877. In January of this year, however,\r\nthe Japanese government ordered from the Société des Forges et\r\nChantiers de la Méditerranée two coast-defence vessels, to be built\r\non the plans of M. Bertin, constructing engineer of the Japanese\r\nnavy. They are to be built entirely of steel, on the cellular\r\nplan, with two longitudinal and twelve transverse bulkheads. Their\r\nprincipal dimensions are: length 295 feet 2 inches, beam 50 feet\r\n6 inches, depth 34 feet 9 inches, draught aft 21 feet 2 inches,\r\ndisplacement 4140 tons. The armament proposed is one 12.6-inch\r\n(32-centimetre) breech-loader, eleven 4.72-inch (12-centimetre)\r\nbreech-loaders, six rapid-fire guns, twelve revolving cannons, and\r\nfour torpedo-tubes—one in the bow, one in the stern, and one each\r\nbroadside. Two independent triple-expansion engines, driving twin\r\nscrews, and required to develop 5400 indicated horse-power with\r\nforced draft, and 3400 with natural draft, supplied with steam by six\r\nthree-furnace boilers in two groups, furnish the motive power. The\r\nestimated maximum speed is sixteen knots. A heavy protective steel\r\ndeck and a complete surrounding arrangement of coal-bunkers protect\r\nthe engine and boiler space and magazines. The complement of officers\r\nand men will number four hundred. In March, 1887, a small armored\r\ngun-vessel, designed by the same official, was laid down at the\r\nIshikawa-Shima dockyard, Japan. The displacement is 750 tons, length\r\n150 feet, and beam 25 feet.[60]\r\n\r\nOf the unarmored vessels, the sister ships _Naniwa-Kan_ (already\r\ndescribed) and _Takatschio_ are at present the most important, though\r\nsix modern cruisers now under construction in Japanese dockyards\r\nwill soon be added to the fleet. The navy is manned and officered\r\nexclusively by natives, and the service is well administered and\r\npopular. Owing to possible complications with China, coast defence\r\nhas become a live national question, and the wealthy Japanese are\r\nsubscribing large sums for ships and forts. In addition to these\r\nvoluntary contributions, the new tax which has been imposed will\r\nenable Japan to put herself in an excellent condition for attack or\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nThe other navies not described in these pages have afloat or under\r\nconstruction but few modern ships-of-war. Still, there are vessels\r\nin the minor services which ought to be briefly described. One of\r\nthese, the _Almirante Brown_, of the Argentine navy, is a twin-screw,\r\ncentral-battery steel ship which was launched in 1880. Her dimensions\r\nare: length 240 feet, beam 50 feet, draught 20 feet 6 inches, and\r\ndisplacement 4200 tons. With 4500 horse-power she attained 13.75\r\nknots, and her coal endurance is given as 4300 knots at 10 knots\r\nspeed. Her armament is made up of eight 8-inch and six 4½-inch\r\nArmstrongs, and of four machine guns; the armor is compound, nine\r\ninches thick on the belt and eight inches on the battery. There is\r\nalso building in England for this government a central casemate steel\r\ncruiser of 4400 tons displacement. The armor on the casemate is to\r\nbe compound, ten inches thick, and the armament is to be composed of\r\neight 8-inch breech-loading Armstrongs, with a secondary battery of\r\nrapid-fire guns and torpedo-tubes. The estimated speed is fourteen\r\nknots. In addition to these two vessels the Argentine navy has two\r\nsmall coast-defence turret-ships, one 14-knot steel cruiser (the\r\n_Patagonia_, which is similar in appearance to the United States\r\nsteamer _Atlanta_), six gun-boats, eleven torpedo-boats, and a few\r\nother vessels of an unimportant character.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian navy has, exclusive of her capital torpedo-boat\r\nflotilla, over fifty vessels, of which a dozen are classed as\r\narmored. These last are mainly medium draught, coast-service\r\nturret-ships and river monitors, though among them are the\r\n_Riachuelo_ and _Aquidaban_, twin-screw armored cruisers, and the\r\n_Solimoes_, an armored battle-ship. The _Riachuelo_ made a sensation\r\nwhen she first appeared, and is still one of the most formidable\r\nvessels in the world. She is built of steel, and has the following\r\ndimensions: length 305 feet, beam 52 feet, draught 19 feet 6 inches,\r\ndisplacement 5700 tons. Her armor is compound, eleven inches thick on\r\nthe belt and ten inches on the turret, conning-tower, and redoubt.\r\nShe has also a steel deck, which curves forward to strengthen the\r\nram, and aft to protect the steering gear. Her armament consists\r\nof four 9-inch 20-ton Whitworths (Armstrong altered) mounted in\r\ntwo echeloned turrets, and of six 5½-inch guns carried under cover\r\nin the superstructure. Her secondary battery includes fifteen\r\nmachine Nordenfeldts and five above-water torpedo-tubes. With 7300\r\nhorse-power she attained a speed of 16.71 knots, and is credited with\r\na coal endurance of 4500 miles at 15 knots speed.\r\n\r\nThe _Aquidaban_ is of the same type and general appearance as the\r\n_Riachuelo_, but of smaller dimensions. Her length is 280 feet, beam\r\n52 feet, draught 18 feet, displacement 4950 tons. The compound armor\r\nis from seven to eleven inches in thickness, and seven feet in width\r\non the water-line belt, and is ten inches thick on the conning-tower\r\nand on the oval redoubts which protect the bases of the two echeloned\r\nturrets. The armored deck and redoubt roofs are built of steel, from\r\ntwo to three inches thick. The armament consists of four 9-inch\r\n20-ton guns mounted in the turrets, and of four 70-pounders carried\r\nunder the superstructure. The secondary battery is made up of fifteen\r\n1-inch Nordenfeldts and five above-water torpedo-tubes. She developed\r\non trial 6251 horse-power and a speed of 15.81 knots, and made on\r\nthe voyage from Lisbon to Bahia 3600 knots in 13 days and 17 hours,\r\nand from Bahia to Rio Janeiro 750 knots in 2 days and 20 hours. The\r\naverage speed for the passage from England to Rio was nearly eleven\r\nknots on a daily coal consumption of forty-three tons.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian navy has the two iron-armored, twin-screw,\r\ncentral-battery ships _Almirante Cochrane_ and _Blanco Encalada_, and\r\nthe lightly armored turret-ship _Huascar_. The _Almirante Cochrane_\r\nand _Blanco Encalada_ are 210 feet in length, 45 feet 9 inches in\r\nbeam, 19 feet 8 inches in draught, and 3500 tons in displacement. The\r\nformer carries four 9-inch and two 7-inch breech-loading Armstrong\r\nrifles, four lighter pieces, and seven machine guns. Before the\r\nalterations and repairs lately made, the _Blanco Encalada_ had\r\nsix 12-ton muzzle-loading Armstrong rifles, four lighter pieces,\r\nand seven machine guns. The _Huascar_ was built in 1865, and is\r\na slightly protected iron ship of 2032 tons displacement, 1050\r\nhorse-power, and 12 knots speed. Her battery consists of two 10-inch\r\nmuzzle-loading Armstrongs and two 40-pounders. Her wonderful record\r\non the west coast of South America has made her name as familiar in\r\nthe mouth as a household word, and whatever may have been the justice\r\nof the war, there never can or will be a question of the superb\r\ncourage with which she was fought by her gallant officers and crew.\r\nChili has three wooden corvettes, the _Chacabuco_, _O’Higgins_, and\r\n_Pilcomayo_, one composite corvette, the _Magellanes_, one steel\r\ncruiser, the _Esmeralda_, five gun-boats, two paddle steamers, one\r\ndespatch-boat, one transport, and eleven torpedo-boats. In April,\r\n1885, the _Esmeralda_ ran from Valparaiso to Callao, 1292 miles,\r\nin one hundred and eight hours, the engines during the last eight\r\nhours barely turning over. In the exhaustive trials made before her\r\ndeparture from England the highest speed attained was 18¼ knots per\r\nhour. The _Esmeralda_ is said to be at present in an inefficient\r\ncondition, both as regards her speed and battery power. In November,\r\n1886, the Chilian government gave the Armstrong firm an order for\r\na powerful, partially-protected steel cruiser, which is to be of\r\n4500 tons displacement, and to develop 19 knots speed. Her armament\r\nis to consist of two 10-inch, one 8-inch, and two 6-inch Armstrong\r\nbreech-loaders, with a secondary battery of four 6-pounder rapid-fire\r\nguns, eight Hotchkiss revolving cannons, and eight torpedo-tubes. The\r\ncost of this vessel is to be about $1,500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nSUBMARINE WARFARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practicability of submarine navigation was established by the\r\nDutch over two hundred and fifty years ago. Then, as now, its\r\nunderlying idea, its claim for recognition, was the advantages the\r\nsystem gave in marine warfare. Nor is its battle value overestimated;\r\nfor such a boat, if successful, exercises an influence that is\r\ngreat in material uses, that is enormous in moral effects. Its\r\ndevelopment has been slow; for though the problem was solved long\r\nago, no practical results were attained until within the last thirty\r\nyears. During the late war submarine boats were for the first time\r\nemployed with such sufficient success that the great maritime powers\r\nhave considered the type to have an importance which justified\r\ninvestigation. They reached this conclusion because no plan of\r\ndefence exists which could defy the operations of a weapon that\r\nattacks not only matter but mind.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger which sailors will not face; because their\r\nenvironments are always perilous, and their traditions are rich\r\nwith glorious records of seeming impossibilities overcome by pluck\r\nand dash. They are willing always, even against the heaviest odds,\r\nto accept any fighting chance. They know that the unexpected is\r\nsure to happen. The spirit that made Farragut take the lead of his\r\ndisorganized line in Mobile Bay still lives; his clarion call of\r\n“Damn the torpedoes! Follow me!” is a sea instinct, born of brine and\r\ngale, which never dies.\r\n\r\nWhatever coast fighting or port blockading may demand, sea battles\r\nare unchanged. History teaches that ships always closed for action,\r\nand that vessels fighting each other from beyond the circling\r\nhorizons, or hull down, with long-range guns, are the dreams of shore\r\ninventors. Guns and ships have changed, but men and the sea are\r\nchangeless. The fighting distance of to-day is not much greater than\r\nit was in Nelson’s or in Perry’s time; and the next naval war will\r\nsurely prove that battle will be nearly as close as in Benbow’s age,\r\nwhen the gallant tars combed innocuous four-pound shots out of their\r\npigtails, and battered each other within biscuit-throwing distance\r\nwith deftly shied chocking quoins.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate, in the interest of good, square fighting, that\r\nthe operative sphere of submarine boats is limited to coast work.\r\nFortunate, because while the bravery and the grit are the same, the\r\nthreatening of a danger which cannot be squarely met is apt to benumb\r\nthe heart of the stoutest. A sailor hates to run; he does not care to\r\nfight another day when the chance of the present is open before him;\r\nbut of what avail are the highest courage and skill against a dull,\r\nvenomous dog of an enemy who crawls in the darkness out of the deeps,\r\nand, silently attaching a mine or torpedo, leaves his impotent foe to\r\nsure destruction?\r\n\r\nSubmarine mines may be countermined; when necessary, defied; guns\r\nmay be silenced and torpedo-boats so riddled by rapid-fire guns that\r\nthey will be disabled beyond the radius of their effective action;\r\nautomatic torpedoes may be checked by netting, or by the prompt\r\nmanœuvrings of the attacked vessel; ship may always fight ship. But\r\nwhat is the chance for brain or brawn against a successful submarine\r\nboat, when the mere suspicion of its presence is enough in itself to\r\nbreak down the blithest, bravest heart of oak. It is here that their\r\nmoral effects are enormous.\r\n\r\nThe history of their development may be briefly told. In 1624\r\nCornelius Van Drebble, a Hollander, made some curious experiments\r\nunder the Thames. His diving-boat was propelled by twelve pairs\r\nof oars and carried a dozen persons, among them King James I. In\r\n1771 Bushnell, of Connecticut, constructed a boat which Washington\r\ndescribed in a letter to Jefferson as being a “machine so contrived\r\nas to carry the inventor under water at any depth he chose, and\r\nfor a considerable time and distance with an appendage charged\r\nwith powder, which he could fasten to a ship, and give fire to it\r\nin time sufficient for his returning, and by means thereof destroy\r\nit.” Fulton borrowed Bushnell’s idea, and in 1801 experimented\r\nsuccessfully with it in the Seine. He descended under water, remained\r\nfor twenty minutes, and after having gone a considerable distance,\r\nemerged. In 1851 a shoemaker named Phillips launched in Lake Michigan\r\na cigar-shaped boat forty feet long and four feet in its greatest\r\ndiameter. This was his first attempt, but in the course of a few\r\nyears he so far perfected his arrangements for purifying the air that\r\non one occasion he took his wife and children, and spent a whole\r\nday in exploring the bottom of the lake. In the history of these\r\nboats, as told in the report of the Board on Fortifications, Phillips\r\nafterwards descended in Lake Erie, near Buffalo, and never reappeared.\r\n\r\nMany other attempts were made, the most successful being that of a\r\nRussian mechanic, who in 1855 built a diving-boat which was under\r\nsuch perfect control that he could remain submerged for eight hours.\r\nThe boat which sank the _Housatonic_ was a remarkable submarine\r\nvessel; it was about thirty-five feet long, built of boiler iron, and\r\nhad a crew of nine men, of whom eight worked the propeller by hand,\r\nwhile the ninth steered and governed the boat. She could be submerged\r\nto any desired depth or could be propelled on the surface. After\r\nvarious mishaps she went out of Charleston harbor, attacked and sank\r\nthe United States steamer _Housatonic_, then on blockade duty; as she\r\nnever returned, it is supposed that the reflex action of the torpedo\r\ndestroyed her.\r\n\r\nIn the report quoted above the results already attained in submarine\r\nnavigation are thus summarized by Captain Maguire, U.S.A.:\r\n\r\n1. Submarine boats have been built in which several persons have\r\ndescended (with safety) for a great distance below the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n2. Submarine boats have been propelled on and under the surface in\r\nall directions.\r\n\r\n3. The problem of supplying the necessary amount of respirable air\r\nfor a crew of several persons for a number of hours has been solved.\r\n\r\n4. Steam, compressed air, and electricity have been used as the\r\nmotive power.\r\n\r\n5. The incandescent electric light has been used for illuminating the\r\ninterior of submarine boats.\r\n\r\n6. Seeing apparatus have been made by which the pilot, while under\r\nwater, may scan the horizon in all directions.\r\n\r\n7. A vessel has been in time of war destroyed by a submarine boat.\r\nThe latter, it is true, was also sunk, but it was for reasons that\r\nare no longer in force.\r\n\r\nAs yet no perfectly successful boat of this type has been tried in\r\nany naval war, but there is no question that they will be used at the\r\nvery first opportunity. Compared with a surface boat, the submarine\r\nhas the following advantages:\r\n\r\n1. It does not need so much speed. The surface boat demands this\r\nquality so as to get quickly within striking range of its torpedo,\r\nand then to escape speedily out of range of machine guns, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Its submersion in the presence of the enemy prevents the engines\r\nbeing heard.\r\n\r\n3. There is no smoke nor glare from the fires to cause its detection.\r\n\r\n4. The boat and crew, being under water, are protected from the fire\r\nof machine guns and rifles.\r\n\r\n5. It is enabled to approach the enemy near enough to make effective\r\neven an uncontrollable fish torpedo.\r\n\r\n6. It can be used with safety as a reconnoitring or despatch-boat.\r\n\r\n7. It can examine the faults in the lines of submarine mines, and\r\nreplace mines exploded in action. Abroad, the Nordenfeldt boat has\r\nawakened the most interest, and here the American submarine monitor\r\nholds the first place.\r\n\r\nThe form of the Nordenfeldt boat is that of a cigar or of an\r\nelongated cylinder tapering away to a fine point at each end. The\r\nouter case, built of stout steel, is calculated in its construction\r\nto resist such a pressure as would enable the boat to descend even\r\nbeyond a depth of fifty feet, although that is set as the maximum\r\nfor its diving operations. The cigar shape does not at first sight\r\ncommend itself, even in the eyes of nautical men, on account of its\r\nsupposed tendency towards a rolling motion. The experience, however,\r\ngained with the boat exhibited for the benefit of naval experts at\r\nCarlscrona, in September, 1885, has shown that very good sea-going\r\nqualities can be developed in a craft built upon such lines; for\r\nthis small vessel has weathered more than one gale in the Baltic, to\r\nsay nothing of the severe storm it encountered at the entrance to\r\nthe Kattegat when proceeding from Gottenburg to Copenhagen for the\r\nexperimental trials.\r\n\r\nThis quality results from the fact that each end of the boat forms a\r\ntank, which is filled with water, and as there is no extra buoyancy\r\nin those directions, and consequently no tendency to lift at those\r\nparts as with an ordinary vessel in a sea-way, the vessel rises and\r\nfalls bodily instead of pitching. It has been found that by going at\r\na moderate speed and taking the seas a point or so on the bows the\r\nboat makes very good weather, as the waves, breaking on the snout,\r\nsweep over the fore part and expend their force before any portion of\r\nthem can reach the central section.\r\n\r\nSteam, which is employed as motive power, is perfectly trustworthy\r\nas an agent. There is nothing about its action, or the appliances\r\nconnected with it, that is beyond the grasp of an ordinary engineer,\r\nwhereas such can hardly be said as yet in respect either to\r\nelectricity or the other agencies by which inventors have sought\r\nto obtain motion. The difficulty, however, has always been how\r\nto retain steam pressure for any great length of time without\r\ncarrying on combustion. This in the Nordenfeldt boat is secured\r\nin the following ingenious manner: A large reservoir or hot-water\r\ncistern (marked Q in the plate) is placed in the fore part of the\r\nboat, in communication with the boiler. The steam from the latter\r\npasses through a number of tubes in the reservoir N, thus raising\r\nthe temperature of its contents until the pressure stands at the\r\nsame degree in both. While the boat is at the surface, the maximum\r\npressure once attained, as long as combustion is carried on, supplies\r\nquite enough steam both for driving the engines at full speed and for\r\nmaintaining the contents of the cistern in the proper superheated\r\ncondition. When the boat is submerged and the furnace doors are\r\nclosed combustion ceases, and the steam given off by the hot-water in\r\nthe boiler and cistern is sufficient to keep the engines going for\r\nseveral hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGITUDINAL PLANS OF NORDENFELDT BOAT.]\r\n\r\nSubmersion to the various depths required is secured by the motion\r\nof the vertically acting screws, S S, driven by small three-cylinder\r\nengines. The boat is so ballasted as always to have spare buoyancy,\r\nand while a few revolutions of the screws will send her under water,\r\nthe arrest of their motion is all that is required to bring her to\r\nthe surface again. In this arrangement, as even the non-technical\r\nreader will readily understand, there is a great element of safety,\r\nthe rising motion being entirely independent of any machinery which\r\nmight refuse to act at the required moment. Another advantage is\r\nalso gained in the ease with which the horizontal position is\r\nmaintained by regulating the speed of the screws. To assist in\r\nkeeping this position there is a horizontal rudder or fin, R, at the\r\nbows, which, by a very ingenious arrangement of a plumb weight with\r\nother mechanism in connection with the steering tower, works both\r\nautomatically and by hand. The torpedoes are carried on the outside\r\nof the boat, as shown at F. They are Swartzkoph or Whitehead, as the\r\ncase may be, and are released by electrical action under the control\r\nof the captain, standing on the platform at P. C is a cupola of stout\r\nglass by which a view is obtained occasionally when the boat is\r\nrunning submerged.\r\n\r\n_Construction Details._—The following are the dimensions of the\r\nTurkish boat: length 100 feet, beam 12 feet, displacement 150\r\ntons, speed 12 knots, and coal endurance sufficient for travelling\r\n900 miles. The engines (E) are of the ordinary inverted compound\r\nsurface-condensing type, with two cylinders, and with 100 pound\r\npressure indicate 250 horse-power. The circulating and air pumps\r\nbeing actuated by a separate cylinder, the main engine is left free\r\nto work or not, while a vacuum is always maintained to assist the\r\nvarious other engines with which the boat is fitted. In this respect\r\nit should be mentioned that all the engines are specially designed\r\nwith such valve arrangements as will make the utmost use of the\r\nvacuum, it having been found that while the boat is running beneath\r\nthe surface as much power can be developed below the atmospheric line\r\nas above it.\r\n\r\nThe boiler, B, is of the ordinary marine return-tube type, with two\r\nfurnaces, and the heating surface is about seven hundred and fifty\r\nsquare feet. The tanks at each end of the boat contain about fifteen\r\ntons each, and there is a third of seven tons capacity at the bottom\r\nof the central compartment for regulating buoyancy. The coal is\r\nstored around the hot-water cistern as well as at the sides of the\r\nboiler and over the central ballast tank.\r\n\r\nThree men and the captain can efficiently work this boat, although\r\nshe may carry a crew of seven, who could remain in her for over\r\nseven hours beneath the water without experiencing any difficulty\r\nin respiration. No attempt is made as in some systems to purify the\r\natmosphere by chemical means, as it is said to be quite unnecessary.\r\n\r\n_The Practical Management._—The boat is operated in the following\r\nmanner: Steam having been raised to the required pressure, the\r\nfunnel is lowered, and water is let into the ballast tanks to bring\r\nthe craft down to the proper trim for action. In this condition the\r\nscrews, S S, are sufficiently under water to obtain the requisite\r\nthrust. The boat may still proceed at the surface for some time if\r\nthe enemy be distant, but the conning-tower should be closed, and the\r\ncupola hatch and the furnace doors shut, before there is any chance\r\nof discovery. The vertically acting screws being started, the boat\r\nis then submerged to the cupola, and continues approaching until,\r\naccording to circumstances, it becomes prudent to disappear entirely.\r\nThe direction is taken at the last moment, and maintained by compass\r\nuntil within striking distance, when a torpedo is released, and the\r\nboat immediately turns in another direction.\r\n\r\nIn May of this year there was launched at Barrow a Nordenfeldt boat\r\n110 feet in length and 13 feet in diameter. The engines are capable\r\nof developing good power, and a speed of 12 knots on the surface\r\nwas realized. The boat was tried on the Bosporus during July under\r\ngovernment supervision, and as these were satisfactory, it seems\r\nlikely that a number of similar vessels will be built next year for\r\nthe Ottoman navy.\r\n\r\nThe original submarine monitor _Peacemaker_ is well known through\r\nits trials on the Hudson River in 1886, but since then so many\r\nimprovements have been made in the direction of increased efficiency\r\nthat it is confidently expected the boat just designed will surpass\r\nits former successes. It must be understood in the beginning that its\r\nessential principle remains the same, all the important improvements\r\nbeing the outgrowth of the experience gained in previous experiments.\r\n\r\nBroadly defined, the new craft has a midship section, which through\r\nits high centre of buoyancy and low centre of gravity gives great\r\nstability of form, or, to make it plain to the non-technical reader,\r\nit differs from the ordinary cigar and tortoise shaped boat in being\r\nmore nearly like the section of a pear, the apex of which forms the\r\nkeel. Its longitudinal section is not unlike the form generally used,\r\nthough the lines are such as have been found to give the form of\r\nleast resistance and the highest speed.\r\n\r\nIt is built of steel, with frames and spacings sufficient to stand\r\nthe pressure of the lowest depth to which the boat is or can be\r\nexpected to go. The old dimensions were: length 30 feet, depth 7\r\nfeet, and beam 8 feet. In order to obtain increased speed the present\r\nvessel will be 50 feet in length, 8 feet in beam, and 8 feet in\r\ndepth, with a displacement of from thirty-five to forty tons, or an\r\namount sufficient to carry the weights of the interchangeable boiler,\r\nof the sixty horse-power engine, and of the provisions and fuel\r\nnecessary for a surface cruise of one week, and, when necessary, for\r\na constantly submerged cruise of twelve hours.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for the new boat are that she is so\r\nself-sustaining as not to need the assistance of any other vessel;\r\nthat she is not an accessary, but has in herself all essentials\r\nof defence; and that she answers all possible necessities for\r\nsubmarine work of any kind whatever, whether in peace or war. The\r\nincreased speed will, it is hoped, give her power to attack modern\r\nvessels under way. When submerged, as was proved last summer, she\r\nsent no bubbles of air to the surface, and had neither a wake nor a\r\nwash to militate against the possibilities of an absolutely secret\r\nattack. Besides these advantages, the boat is said to be a safe\r\nsurface-cruising vessel, forming no target for the destructive action\r\nof an enemy’s attack, and at the same time having a capacity for\r\ndisappearing so readily under water and avoiding the possibility of\r\ndiscovery that the enemy will be unable to tell when, where, or how\r\nthe assault upon him may be made.\r\n\r\nAs in a former trial an accident proved the danger of an exposed\r\nconning-tower, the Submarine Monitor Company have provided a\r\nfin or guard for protecting the new helmsman’s lookout and\r\ncompanion-hatches. The waterlock appliance employed in the original\r\nboat has now an additional use in supplying a mode of egress and\r\ningress, the opening being made telescopic, so as to permit surface\r\nruns in comparatively rough water. When submerged, the smoke-stack\r\nacts telescopically, and is closed with a water-tight valve. To avoid\r\nthe necessity of divers going out of the boat when under water,\r\nthere are various openings at places in the exterior skin to which\r\nrubber sleeves or arms, with a radius sufficient to cover almost\r\nall practical necessities, will be fitted. These apertures do not\r\nconstitute planes of weakness or danger, because they are normally\r\nclosed by stout water-tight dead-lights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUBMARINE MONITOR “PEACEMAKER.”]\r\n\r\nThe Westinghouse engine is employed, as its construction prevents,\r\nby the packing used, any radiation of heat and the consequent\r\nelevation of temperation below. The air-tight doors and bulkheads\r\nwork laterally, and the conning-dome is made of steel, with such\r\napertures as will enable the helmsman to have, when on the surface,\r\nan all-round view, and when submerged, a sufficient light to let him\r\nin the daytime read, at a depth of thirty feet, the time by his watch.\r\n\r\nShould the necessity arise, when submerged, the purity of the\r\natmosphere below is preserved by passing the air through caustic\r\nsoda, thus eliminating carbonic acid gas, and by reinforcing the loss\r\nof oxygen from tanks of compressed air. In the original experiments\r\nthe boat was frequently submerged six hours at a time, and the crew\r\nof two men had no other air supplied than that which the boat carried\r\ndown with her.\r\n\r\nBesides these chemical means there are rubber tubes floated by buoys,\r\nwith nozzles which protrude above the wash of the surface water.\r\nThere is in each tube an automatic valve, which prevents water\r\ncoming through the pipe at the time the air is being pumped in, and\r\nthe depth below the surface to which outside air can be supplied is\r\nlimited only by the length of the pipe.\r\n\r\nIn the plate, A represents a patented interchangeable boiler, in\r\nwhich either hydro-carbonate fuel or caustic soda can be used, in\r\nboth cases steam being the motive power. The interior boiler for\r\nthe use of the caustic soda is surrounded by a jacket, into which\r\nthe steam exhausted from the engine can be used before it becomes\r\nso saturated as to create a back pressure on the engine, that is,\r\nfor a period of twelve hours. When this limit is attained, and\r\nthe surface is reached, the soda can be blown off into an outer\r\nreceptacle provided for the purpose, and then reheated and recharged.\r\nThe hydro-carbon fuel is ordinary mineral oil, carried in tanks of\r\nsufficient capacity for a surface run of a week. It may be emphasized\r\nas an important fact that this method of exhausting into the jacket\r\nof the boiler avoids the possibility of any bubbles appearing on the\r\nsurface, as was notably the case with the earlier Lay boats.\r\n\r\nBefore diving, the caustic soda, which has been already heated by\r\nthe combustion of the oil to the proper degree, acts in place of the\r\nordinary fuel, thus constituting a sort of perpetual motion, until\r\nthe point of saturation is reached, and back pressure in the engine\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe boat, when on the surface, is run with the oil fuel, but as\r\nsoon as it becomes necessary to dive this fire is extinguished,\r\nthe after-hatch is opened by unlocking the door of the bulkhead\r\nseparating the after from the bulkheaded end of the vessel, and by\r\na system of fans the hot air from the fire-room is driven outboard.\r\nThen the after telescopic hatch is reefed and secured, the soda is\r\nthrown from the receptacle where it has been heated into the jacket\r\nof the caustic-soda boiler, the fires are put out, the smoke-stack\r\nis taken in and securely fastened, and the machinist, leaving\r\nthe engine-room, goes through the bulkhead door into the forward\r\ncompartment, where he has complete control of the machinery and\r\nboiler by means of a duplicate set of gauges and levers. In case of\r\nan attack, the man detailed for operating the main torpedo is left in\r\nthe after compartment, where he has access to that weapon and to the\r\nbuoy, reel, and other mechanical appliances employed in its operation.\r\n\r\nThe helmsman, who controls the steering apparatus that governs\r\nthe horizontal and perpendicular rudders, also operates with his\r\nfeet the levers which are connected by links to the throttle that\r\nsupplies steam to cylinders K K. These last function like the\r\nWestinghouse brake, and are connected with pistons to the cylinders\r\nJ J. Through their agency water is at will admitted into or forced\r\nout of the larger receptacles, either from one end or from both ends\r\nsimultaneously. The effect of discharging water is of course to\r\nincrease the buoyancy of the vessel; and of admitting it, to decrease\r\nthis quality so that without changing structural weights the boat\r\nis enabled to rise or sink perpendicularly, or, by admitting more\r\nwater in one end than in the other, to take a downward or an upward\r\ncourse. Though this does away with the necessity of the horizontal\r\nrudder, it is kept as an additional resource for steering. In case of\r\naccident to the connecting pipes or machinery the vessel is supplied\r\nwith water receptacles and hand-pumps, which are able to govern its\r\nsubmergence so that should all other mechanism break down the boat is\r\nso completely under the control of the operator that it can at all\r\ntimes be brought to the surface. As an additional safeguard, there\r\nis on the outside of the boat a quantity of ballast which can be\r\nreadily detached by the arms or sleeves previously described, and so\r\neffectively that the reserve buoyancy thus gained will alone carry\r\nthe boat to the surface.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the main torpedo and buoy resting in the cylindrical\r\napertures aft, other torpedoes, connected by spans, are carried\r\non deck. The method of their employment in attack is to go under\r\nthe body of the vessel athwartship, and to liberate them. As they\r\nare fitted with magnets, they will, it is claimed, when freed,\r\nattach themselves to the bilges of the enemy’s vessel, while the\r\n_Peacemaker_ can continue her cruise and let them act automatically,\r\nor, backing off to a distance greater than the depth of water in\r\nwhich she then is, safely explode them by conventional electrical\r\nappliances. With the increased speed of the present boat there are\r\nvarious methods of attacking vessels of war when under way, among\r\nthem one which is somewhat similar to that described above.\r\n\r\nThe _Peacemaker_, when under the body of the vessel athwartship,\r\nwould liberate a buoy, B, that is connected with a torpedo, T, by a\r\nchain, the length of which depends upon the depth beneath the buoy\r\nthe torpedo is desired to float. The steel tow-line to the torpedo is\r\npayed out from reel G to a sufficient length, and then by going ahead\r\nwith the boat the torpedo is drawn close under the opposite side of\r\nvessel from buoy B. In this position the torpedo can be exploded by\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, by liberating buoy B, while crossing the bow on the\r\nstarboard side of the fore-foot of a vessel, the forward motion will\r\ndraw the torpedo, T, close in to the opposite side; then, by a system\r\nof push-pins on the torpedo, the operator learns that it is in close\r\ncontact and ready for explosion by electricity. Should the enemy’s\r\nvessel be at anchor the tide can be employed for the purpose of\r\nbringing the buoy on one side of the vessel while the torpedo is on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe boat is supplied with the ordinary incandescent lights, or\r\napparatus for lighting the interior for night attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORPEDOES.\r\n\r\nAmerica has contributed to modern warfare many of its most valuable\r\ninventions. In the decade of 1850-60 the steam frigates of the\r\n_Merrimac_ class revolutionized the naval constructions of the\r\nworld, and became the models for the war-ships of the great maritime\r\npowers. In the same period our coast defences reached the high-water\r\nmark of modern development, and, soon to be crystallized, there\r\nwere seething in the brains of American inventors ideas of guns,\r\nships, and projectiles which made history. Though to-day our created\r\ncontributions to quick peace through arrested or irresistible war\r\nare meagre, still many of the theories which make possible modern\r\nordnance and ships are the fruits of American genius and industry.\r\n\r\nIs the future to be as fertile in thought and deed? Are the\r\ndestroyers of Ericsson, the dynamite safety shells of Hayes, the guns\r\nof Zalinski, the torpedoes of Howell, Sims, or Berdan, the turrets of\r\nTimby, the submarine monitors of Tuck, the gun-carriages of King or\r\nBuffington, the ordnance of Sicard, Benét—are these to prove that\r\nYankee brain and brawn are potent yet for the mastery of the problem?\r\n\r\nThe country has no plainer duty than to foster by every care American\r\nideas working in national ways of thought. It is rich, public\r\nsentiment is ripe and responsive, and Congress should encourage in\r\npeace the experiments which may make war impossible. In the question\r\nof ship armament and sea-coast fortifications notably, the value of\r\ntorpedoes is now so generally recognized that the definite selection\r\nof some type has attained an importance which demands most careful\r\nconsideration. All experts agree that they are vital, but there is\r\nnot that consensus of opinion which within limits affirms exactly\r\nwhat should be done.\r\n\r\nThe Fortification Board in their report say: “It is not generally\r\nconsidered possible to bar the progress of an armored fleet by the\r\nmere fire of a battery; some obstructions sufficient to arrest the\r\nships within effective range of the guns is necessary. The kind\r\nof obstruction now relied upon is the torpedo, in the form of a\r\nsubmarine mine, and, except in special cases, exploded by electric\r\ncurrents which are so managed that the operator on shore can either\r\nignite the mine under the ship’s bottom, or allow the ship to explode\r\nit by contact. In deep channels the submarine mines are buoyant; in\r\ncomparatively shallow waters they are placed upon the bottom—the\r\nobject in both cases being to touch or nearly approach the hull of\r\nthe vessel. Submarine mines are not accessaries to defence, but are\r\nessential features wherever they can be applied.”\r\n\r\nThe Senate Committee on Ordnance and War-ships reported: “Concerning\r\nanother class of torpedoes, ‘fixed’ or ‘anchored’ or ‘planted,’\r\ntechnically known as submarine mines, there is a great popular\r\nmisapprehension. Their value is greatly overestimated. They require\r\npicked and trained men for their management, electrical apparatus\r\nfor their discharge and for lighting up the approaches, stations on\r\nshore secure against sudden assault, a flanking fire of canister and\r\ncase shot and of machine guns (themselves protected), light draught\r\npicket-boats, and the overshadowing protection of armored forts and\r\nheavy guns. None of these things can be extemporized. The submarine\r\nmine alone is of little use, and it must accompany, not precede, more\r\ncostly and less easily prepared means of defence.”\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a more definite agreement as to the value of\r\ntorpedo-boats. The Fortification Board declare: “Among the most\r\nimportant means of conducting an active defence of the coast is the\r\ntorpedo-boat, which, although recently developed, has received the\r\nsanction of the nations of Europe, each one of which now possesses\r\na large number of these vessels. Their use will be quite general.\r\nFirst, in disturbing blockades, and preventing these from being\r\nmade close, as no fleet would like to lie overnight within striking\r\ndistance of a station of these boats; secondly, in attacking an\r\nenemy’s ship enveloped in fog or smoke; thirdly, in relieving a\r\nvessel pursued by the enemy; and fourthly, in defending the mines\r\nby night and by day against attempts at counter-mining, and in many\r\nother ways not necessary to recapitulate.” Impressed with the utility\r\nof this mode of defence, the Board recommended the construction of\r\none hundred and fifty of these boats, and the organization of a\r\nspecial corps of officers and men from the navy trained to their use.\r\n\r\nIn England, Commander Gallwey does not hesitate to say that the\r\ntorpedo-boat is for harbor defence so superior to the submarine\r\nmine that he would not be surprised if before long it superseded\r\nthe latter altogether. In France, Charmes insists that an armored\r\nvessel will run the most serious risk if a torpedo-boat is allowed to\r\napproach unobserved to within one thousand to fifteen hundred feet;\r\nthat the torpedo will surely triumph over the iron-clad, and that\r\narmor has been vanquished, not by the gun, but by the torpedo.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NAVAL RESERVE.\r\n\r\nAmong the problems to be solved by an efficient naval administration\r\nthere is none more difficult or of greater importance than the\r\nformation of reserves of seamen. Our late war exposed the nation’s\r\nweakness in sailors. At the beginning of hostilities the fleet,\r\non paper, consisted of forty-two ships of all classes, mainly\r\nsailing-vessels, with a few paddle-wheel steamers, and less than\r\nten screw-vessels with auxiliary power. Its _personnel_ comprised\r\nseven thousand of all grades. And yet, to blockade a coast of over\r\nthree thousand miles in length, the Secretary of the Navy had at\r\nhis disposal but three effective vessels, and a reserve of only\r\ntwo hundred seamen on all the receiving-ships and at all the naval\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nAs late as the first of July, 1863, there were not men enough to\r\ncarry out efficiently the work imposed upon the navy, and of the\r\nthirty-four thousand blue-jackets twenty-five thousand were landsmen.\r\nSecretary Welles, at the end of the same year, complained that there\r\nwere no reserve seamen, that the supply for immediate and imperative\r\nduties was so inadequate that one of the largest and fastest steamers\r\ndestined for important foreign service had been detained for months\r\nin consequence of the need of a crew, and that many other vessels\r\nwere very much short of their complements. The cause of this was want\r\nof foresight, of prudence, of national common-sense even. We did not\r\nlack the material from which crews could have been drawn, for in\r\n1860 over seventy-five thousand men sailed in the American merchant\r\nmarine, fifty thousand of whom, under any system of enrolment suited\r\nto our national instincts and prejudices, would, before the end of\r\n1861, have been available for duty on shipboard.\r\n\r\nIn peace there had been no organization, so when war came we were\r\nalmost helpless, and as late as the end of 1863 not twenty per cent.\r\nof the men who should have been ready for service were in government\r\nships. Let _doctrinaires_ theorize as they may, this was not the\r\nfault of our maritime class, for thousands of sailors and fishermen\r\nwho had already entered the army were by force of law denied the\r\nopportunity either of enlisting in, or of being transferred to, the\r\nnavy. In addition, the operation of the draft was made detrimental to\r\nthe naval interests of the country, for it violated the Act of May,\r\n1792, which exempts from military duty all mariners actually employed\r\nin the sea service of any citizen or merchant within the United\r\nStates. Furthermore, the government unjustly discriminated against\r\nthe seaboard towns, for not only was the seafaring class, which is\r\nfostered and cherished by all maritime governments, withdrawn from\r\nthe element to which it has been accustomed, but in addition sailors\r\nactually afloat were taken from their ships and compelled, under the\r\npenalty of law, to enter the land service. It was not until 1864 that\r\nCongress finally enacted the law which enabled seamen serving as\r\nsoldiers to be drafted into the navy.\r\n\r\nHow different would have been the state of affairs had there existed\r\nin 1861 some system of government administration as to the creation\r\nof naval reserves, or, more far-reaching still, had we been free from\r\nthat illogical distrust which possessed the whole country! The fear\r\nof too much centralization was the stock in trade of professional\r\npatriots, and the people, hampered by traditions which had come\r\ndown to us from our English ancestors, saw in any attempt towards\r\nefficient war preparation in times of peace all the dangers they had\r\nbeen taught to believe existed in standing armies.\r\n\r\nEngland acted more wisely, for she had been taught a grim lesson\r\nby her adversities, and without fear we might have profited by her\r\nexample. In the history of the Peninsula war, Napier, after picturing\r\nthe horrors of the fearful April night when Badajoz was stormed,\r\nasked, bitterly,\r\n\r\n  “And why was all this striving in blood against insurmountable\r\n  difficulties? Why were men sent thus to slaughter when the\r\n  application of a just science would have rendered the operations\r\n  comparatively easy?\r\n\r\n  “Because the English ministers, so ready to plunge into war,\r\n  were quite ignorant of its exercises; because the English people\r\n  are warlike without being military, and, under the pretence of\r\n  maintaining liberty which they do not possess, oppose in peace all\r\n  useful martial establishments. In the beginning of each war England\r\n  had to seek in blood for the knowledge necessary to insure success.”\r\n\r\nEqually has this always been the attitude of the American people\r\ntowards every attempt made in peace to prepare for war. Besides this\r\nnational distrust, prejudices had to be overcome which have existed\r\nboth in the navy and the merchant marine. Our naval officers have\r\nnever made any determined effort to create a reserve, either because\r\nthey have not fully grasped the correlation and interdependence of\r\nthe navy and the merchant marine, or because they have doubted the\r\nwisdom of spending upon an outside issue appropriations which, given\r\nto the navy, would produce a more immediate and tangible result. But\r\nfrom both points of view they are wrong, “for a navy unsupported by a\r\nmerchant marine is a hot-house plant which may produce great results\r\nfor a while, but cannot endure the strain of a long protracted\r\ncampaign.” From the merchant marine the _personnel_ of the navy\r\nin war must come, and it is a fallacy to believe that by a small\r\naddition to our ordinary naval resources we would be able to cope\r\nwith the navies of other maritime powers, or that in a long war an\r\nefficient and numerous reserve is not of greater importance than a\r\nfew more seamen permanently maintained in the navy during peace.\r\n\r\nTo the merchants and ship-owners the question is one of vital\r\nimportance. The earliest and most disastrous consequence of war\r\nwill fall upon the shipping interest. Under any system of defence\r\nthe necessities of the navy must withdraw seamen from the merchant\r\nservice and raise the rate of wages. If, then, by timely precautions\r\nduring peace, we can diminish the probability that war can occur\r\nat all; if we are ready upon the outbreak of war to show that our\r\nhomeward-bound ships are safe; if we can abolish or modify the risk\r\nthat the employment of seamen would be abruptly suspended by embargo\r\nor interfered with by impressment or draft; if we can attach the\r\nsailor to his country, and prevent him from seeking employment under\r\nother flags, surely the owners of our ships and merchants will reap\r\nthe greatest advantage. Abroad the importance of the subject has been\r\nfully recognized. France, under a system which has existed for over\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years, maintains a reserve of 172,000 men,\r\nwho are between the ages of eighteen and fifty; 65,000 of these are\r\nbetween the ages of twenty and twenty-six, 15,000 are usually kept\r\nafloat, and 6000 more are quartered on shore. Germany has 15,000, and\r\nEngland nearly the same number.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the decadence of our shipping interest we have a\r\nlarge force from which to draw. The maritime population of this\r\ncountry numbers over 350,000, of whom 180,000 are available for the\r\nfleet. This number of course includes all those in any way connected\r\nwith sea industries, and embraces coasters, fishermen, whalers,\r\nyachtsmen, boatmen, and all workmen in ship-building yards and\r\nequipment shops and stores.\r\n\r\nTo man our ships in time of war three means are open: voluntary\r\nenlistment, draft or impressment, or employment of men enrolled in a\r\nnaval reserve. It would be unreasonable to depend altogether upon the\r\nloyal and unselfish patriotism of necessitous men serving before the\r\nmast, and there is a chance that mere enthusiasm would not induce a\r\nseaman to join the navy if employment was being offered elsewhere at\r\nincreasing rates of pay. Impressment under any name is unpopular. In\r\nits common form it is illegal, and the draft is ever a last resort\r\nand always a dangerous measure. Nothing, then, remains as a certainty\r\nbut to turn towards the naval reserve as the best means of manning\r\nour fleet. In time of war not only would the men enrolled come\r\nforward willingly and be immediately available, but deserters would\r\nhave the machinery of the law put in motion for their apprehension,\r\nand popular feeling would be as earnest in support of their arrest\r\nas it would be opposed to all attempts which enforced the arbitrary\r\npowers of draft or impressment.\r\n\r\nNo system exists abroad entirely suited to our necessities and our\r\nnational instincts; but, generally speaking, that adopted in England\r\ncomes nearest to what we should employ. Naturally our lake sailors,\r\ncoasters, fishermen, and yachtsmen would form the main body of the\r\nreserve. These should be enrolled, divided into classes, be given\r\neach year a certain fixed sum of pay, with an increase for each day’s\r\ndrill, and at stated times they should be embarked for great gun\r\npractice at sea, so they might learn something of man-of-war routine\r\nand discipline. The officers could be drawn from the merchant marine,\r\nfrom the graduates of the school-ships, and from former officers of\r\nthe regular and volunteer services who are now in civil life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCED DRAFT.\r\n\r\nThe subject of forced draft is of great importance, and, as a\r\ncorollary of high-speed development, is being studied with keen\r\ninterest. There are wide differences of opinion not only as to the\r\nproper systems, but even as to the value of the principle. The\r\nliterature as yet is rather meagre, but an excellent compilation of\r\nexisting material will be found in the latest publication of the\r\nNaval Intelligence Office.\r\n\r\n“A forced draft in the furnaces,” explains the _Marine Engineer_ of\r\nSeptember, 1887, “can be generated in two ways: first, by exhausting\r\nthe uptakes and funnels of the products of combustion, when a greater\r\nflow of air will necessarily take place through the fire-bars; and\r\nsecondly, by increasing the pressure of the air in the furnaces\r\nbeyond that of the atmosphere. The steam-blast in marine boilers is\r\nwell known to engineers as a means of quickly getting up the steam\r\nafter its pressure has dropped; but the locomotives on our railways\r\nafford a very good illustration of how boilers may be continuously\r\nworked under forced combustion through a jet of steam exhausting\r\nthe smoke-box and funnel of the products of combustion. This system\r\nof creating a draft involves a very large expenditure of steam and\r\nwater, and as it is a _sine qua non_ in these days of high pressure\r\nthat only fresh water should be used in boilers, and also as only a\r\nlimited supply of this element can be carried in a ship, it follows\r\nthat the plan of inducing a forced draft by means of a steam jet in\r\nthe funnel cannot be well adopted in marine boilers.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Martin, the inventor of the well-known furnace doors,\r\nsubstitutes a fan in the uptake for the steam jet, and so arranges\r\nhis funnel that in the event of the forced draft not being required\r\nthe gases of combustion arising from natural draft will not be\r\nimpeded in their exit to the atmosphere. He claims for his invention\r\nthat it does away with all necessity for closing in the stoke-holds\r\nor furnaces, and that in war-ships funnels could be dispensed with,\r\nas the gases and smoke could be discharged anywhere from the fans. He\r\nalso claims that by his plan of producing a draft the boiler-tubes\r\nbecome much more efficient as heating surfaces, and that the ends\r\nof the tubes in the fire-box are not so liable to be burned away,\r\nand that therefore there will be less chance of the boiler leaking\r\nround the tubes. There appears to be some grounds for these latter\r\nassumptions, for it is a well-known fact that the tubes of locomotive\r\nboilers, which are worked, as we have seen, on the exhaust principle,\r\ndo very much more work than those of marine boilers before they are\r\nferruled or rolled. It can also be shown by a very simple experiment\r\nthat when the gases are sucked or drawn through the tubes the flame\r\nextends a much greater distance along the tube than when the gases\r\nare driven through the tubes. In this latter case the flame impinges\r\non the tube-plates before separating into tongues and entering the\r\ntubes; but when sucked through the tongues of flame commence at some\r\nlittle distance from the plate before penetrating the tubes, and the\r\nends are not therefore burned as when the flame impinges directly on\r\nthem. It may be urged, however, against Martin’s system that owing\r\nto the greatly increased volume of the products of combustion due to\r\ntheir temperature, fans of from three to four times the size of those\r\nused in other systems are required; also, that the uptakes have to\r\nbe made larger and heavier to take in the fans; and lastly, that the\r\nfans themselves are likely to be quickly rendered inefficient through\r\nworking in a temperature of at least a thousand degrees. These\r\nobjections prove so formidable that up till the present time Martin’s\r\nplan of creating a forced draft has made little or no headway.\r\n\r\n“The other plan for creating an artificial draft in marine furnaces\r\nis to force air into them by means of fans. This is done either by\r\nclosing in the whole of the stoke-hold and filling it with air of\r\na pressure greater than that of the atmosphere, or by pumping the\r\nair direct into the furnace. This latter is the usual practice in\r\nthe mercantile marine, where economy of fuel is sought after. Mr.\r\nHowden seeks, by first heating the air, and then forcing it by means\r\nof fans into the furnaces and ash-pits, to insure a very rapid and\r\ncomplete combustion of the coal. His plan has been carried out in the\r\nAtlantic liner _Ohio_ quite recently, and the results as published\r\nlead one to expect that with a little more progress in the direction\r\nin which he is working our ships will be driven across the Atlantic\r\nwithout the expenditure of any fuel whatever. The fact of heating\r\nthe air to a temperature of two hundred degrees before it enters the\r\nfurnace cannot go very far in affecting either the rapidity or the\r\ncompleteness of the combustion of the fuel, and it certainly cannot\r\naffect the economy. Where the fire-grate area is small compared with\r\nthe total heating surface, good evaporative results are likely to\r\nbe obtained; and in the _Ohio_ the fire-grate area was certainly\r\nsmaller than is usual for the same sized boilers fitted with forced\r\ndraft. The trip of the _Ohio_ to America has given somewhat different\r\nresults to those of the official trials, and it is a question whether\r\nany saving in weight, either in the apparatus required to produce\r\nforced draft under this system, or in the economy of fuel to be\r\nderived from it, has been obtained more than exists in the system of\r\nclosed stoke-holds.\r\n\r\n“The only plan that seems to hold its own is the closed stoke-hold\r\nsystem, and the results that have been obtained with it in the\r\nnavy are so satisfactory that Messrs. J. & G. Thomson are about to\r\nadopt it in the two large Inman liners they are now building; and\r\nalso several other firms are about to introduce it in preference to\r\nall other plans for increasing the efficiency of their boilers and\r\npromoting greater economy. In the Royal Navy space and weight are\r\nof such vital importance that the boilers have to be constructed on\r\nprinciples the very reverse of those which exist in boilers specially\r\ndesigned for high evaporative work per pound of fuel; and it is\r\nnot, therefore, to be wondered at that the consumption of fuel per\r\nindicated horse-power has not been reduced since the introduction of\r\nforced draft; but, on the other hand, the capabilities of the boilers\r\nhave been expanded far beyond the expectations of a few years ago.\r\nIn the mercantile marine there is no reason whatever why the system\r\nof closed stoke-holds for creating a forced draft should not combine\r\neconomy with greater efficiency in the boilers.”\r\n\r\nThese conclusions are not universally accepted, as will be seen in\r\nthe following extract from the article contributed by Assistant\r\nEngineer R. S. Griffin, United States Navy, to the Naval Intelligence\r\nOffice publication mentioned at the beginning of this subject.\r\n\r\n“The forced-draft trials of the _Archer_ class,” he writes, “go far\r\ntowards sustaining the objections raised by Mr. Howden against the\r\nclosed stoke-hold system. The trials of the _Archer_, _Brisk_, and\r\n_Cossack_ had to be discontinued on several occasions, owing to\r\nleakage of the boiler-tubes; and when it is remembered that these\r\ntrials are for only four hours, and that no provision is made for\r\nhoisting ashes, it becomes a question of serious consideration\r\nwhether the maintenance of this high power for such a short period\r\nbrings with it advantages at all comparable with the continued\r\ndevelopment of a reasonably high power with an economical expenditure\r\nof coal, such as is possible with the closed ash-pit system.\r\n\r\n“A number of steamers have been fitted with Howden’s system during\r\nthe past year, among others the _Celtic_, of the White Star Line,\r\nand the _Ohio_, of the International Navigation Company. One of the\r\nlatest steamers fitted with this system is the _City of Venice_,\r\nwhose engines were converted from compound to quadruple expansion.\r\nHer boilers were designed to develop 1800 indicated horse-power with\r\neighty square feet of grate, but on trial she could only work off\r\n1300 indicated horse-power, owing to some derangement of the valves.\r\nShe was afterwards tried with half the grate surface in use, when it\r\nwas demonstrated that there would be no difficulty in developing the\r\npower so far as the boilers were concerned. Unfortunately, no data as\r\nto weight of boilers, space, or heating surface are obtainable.\r\n\r\n“In 1886 the _Alliance_ was supplied with new boilers, fitted\r\nwith a system of forced draft designed by the Bureau of Steam\r\nEngineering. It was originally the intention of the Department to\r\nput six boilers in this vessel, as in the _Enterprise_ and _Nipsic_,\r\nbut with the introduction of the forced-draft system, which was\r\npurely experimental, this number was reduced to four, having a total\r\ngrate surface of 128 square feet. The boilers were designed to burn\r\nanthracite coal with natural draft, and were of course unsuited to\r\nthe requirements of forced draft, the ratio of heating to grate\r\nsurface being only 25.6 to 1, and the water surface and steam space\r\nbeing small. The maximum indicated horse-power developed on trial\r\nwas 1022, but any attempt to run at this or at increased power for\r\nany length of time was attended with so much priming of the boilers\r\nthat the trial had to be discontinued. Alterations were made in the\r\nboilers to prevent the priming, but no continuous trial was had\r\npreviously to the sailing of the _Alliance_. The results obtained\r\non a measured base were, however, sufficient to demonstrate the\r\npracticability of the system, and to show that a higher power could\r\nbe maintained with the four boilers at forced draft than with the\r\noriginal eight boilers at natural draft.\r\n\r\n“The practical working of the system at sea presents no difficulty,\r\nas a recent run of the _Alliance_ has demonstrated. On a continuous\r\nrun of ten hours, using only two boilers with sixty square feet\r\nof grate (the grate surface of each boiler having been reduced to\r\nthirty), the mean indicated horse-power was 668 and the maximum\r\n744, being respectively 11.1 and 12.4 indicated horse-power per\r\nsquare foot of grate. There was an entire absence of priming, and no\r\ndifficulty was experienced in operating the forced-draft apparatus,\r\nthe length of the trial having been determined by the arrival of\r\nthe vessel in port. The coal burned was Welsh, of fair quality, the\r\nconsumption being 29.9 pounds per square foot of grate.\r\n\r\n“The efficiency of the system may be judged by the results obtained\r\nfrom an experimental boiler at the Washington Navy-yard. The boiler\r\nwas of the marine locomotive type, and had a ratio of heating to\r\ngrate surface of 32.73 to 1, with a water space of 245 and a steam\r\nspace of 163 cubic feet. The coal burned was ordinary Cumberland\r\nValley bituminous, and the evaporation, when burning as much as forty\r\npounds per square foot of grate, was 6.61, while with 37.5 it was\r\n7.24, and this with a moderate air pressure—1.5 inches in ash-pit\r\nand one inch on furnace door.”\r\n\r\nIt is unfair to attempt the explanation of this system without\r\naccompanying drawings, but it may be stated that the air, drawn by\r\nfan-blowers from the heated portion of the fire-room, is forced\r\nthrough a passage into the ash-pit and furnace, a portion of the\r\ncurrent being directed by an interposed plate through the holes in\r\nthe furnace frame. By the agency of a double row of holes the greater\r\nportion of the air which enters the furnace passes around the frame,\r\nthence through other apertures to the space between the furnace door\r\nand lining, and finally to the furnace through the space between the\r\nlining and furnace frame. The supply of air when firing or hauling\r\nashes is shut off by a damper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.[61]\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF TYPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter appeared in the _Times_ (London) of April 4,\r\n1885:\r\n\r\n  “SIR,—May I request the favor of space in the _Times_ in which to\r\n  comment upon the opinions recently expressed by Sir Edward Reed\r\n  and other writers respecting the designs of the _Admiral_ class of\r\n  ships in the Royal Navy, and the four central-citadel ships which\r\n  were laid down subsequently to the _Inflexible_?\r\n\r\n  “Having been closely associated with Mr. Barnaby in the designing\r\n  of all these ships, with the exception of the _Ajax_ and\r\n  _Agamemnon_, I can speak with full knowledge of both the history\r\n  and intentions of the designs.\r\n\r\n  “Moreover, my share of the responsibility for the professional work\r\n  involved in those designs remains, although my official connection\r\n  with the constructive department of the Admiralty was severed years\r\n  ago. It need hardly be added that the remarks which follow simply\r\n  embody my own opinions, and that I write neither as an apologist\r\n  for Mr. Barnaby nor as a champion of the ship-building policy of\r\n  the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n  “The sweeping condemnation which has been pronounced against the\r\n  most recent English battle-ships is based upon the consideration\r\n  of one feature only in their fighting efficiency, _viz._, the\r\n  extent of the armor protection of their sides in the region of the\r\n  water-line. There has been no discussion in the letters to which\r\n  I have referred of the comparative speeds, armaments, or other\r\n  qualities of the French and English ships. But the fact that the\r\n  French ships are armor-belted from end to end, while the English\r\n  ships have no vertical armor on considerable portions of the length\r\n  at the region of the water-line, is considered by Sir Edward Reed\r\n  so serious a matter that he says, ‘The French armored ships must in\r\n  all reason be expected to dispose of these English ships in a very\r\n  few minutes by simply destroying their unarmored parts.’\r\n\r\n  “From this opinion I most strongly dissent, for reasons which are\r\n  stated below; and I venture to assert that if attention is directed\r\n  simply to the possible effects of gun-fire, while the possibly\r\n  greater risks incidental to attacks with the ram and torpedo are\r\n  altogether neglected, then there is ample justification for the\r\n  belief that the English ships of recent design can do battle on at\r\n  least equal terms with their contemporaries in the French or any\r\n  other navy.\r\n\r\n  “In all recent armored ships, if the wholesale and extremely rapid\r\n  destruction of the unarmored portions of the ships which Sir\r\n  Edward Reed contemplates actually took place, very considerable\r\n  risks would undoubtedly result; but in my judgment these risks\r\n  are not sensibly affected by the different distribution of the\r\n  armor on the ships of the two great navies. And, further, there\r\n  is every reason for doubting whether such wholesale destruction\r\n  of the unarmored parts could be effected with the appliances\r\n  which are now available, not merely in ‘a few minutes,’ but in a\r\n  very considerable time, and under the most favorable conditions\r\n  for the attack. Nor must it be forgotten that armor, even of\r\n  the greatest thickness, applied to the sides or decks of ships\r\n  is not impenetrable to the attack of guns already afloat, while\r\n  the _mitraille_, which is driven back into a ship when armor is\r\n  penetrated, is probably as destructive as any kind of projectile\r\n  can be, and attacks directly the vital parts which the armor is\r\n  intended to protect.\r\n\r\n  “In support of these assertions I must ask permission to introduce\r\n  certain detailed statements which appear to be absolutely necessary\r\n  to a discussion of the subject, but which shall be made as brief\r\n  and untechnical as possible.\r\n\r\n  “It appears that the points raised by the discussion may be grouped\r\n  under two heads. First, does the shortening of the belt in the\r\n  English ships introduce such serious dangers if they have to do\r\n  battle with the French ships? Secondly, what should be considered\r\n  the principal uses of armor-plating in modern war-ships? The second\r\n  question may be considered to include the first; but it will be\r\n  convenient to take the questions in the order in which they have\r\n  been placed, as, after all, the greatest immediate interest centres\r\n  in the comparison between existing ships.\r\n\r\n  “At the outset it is important to remark that in the most recent\r\n  designs of armored ships for all navies, increase in speed,\r\n  armament, and thickness of armor has been associated with a\r\n  decrease in the area of the broadside protected by armor. Further,\r\n  it has been considered important in most cases to distribute the\r\n  armored positions of the heavy guns in the ships in order to reduce\r\n  the risks of complete disablement of the principal armament by\r\n  one or two lucky shots which may happen when the heavy guns are\r\n  concentrated in a single citadel or battery. This distribution\r\n  of the heavy guns also gives greater efficiency to the auxiliary\r\n  armament of lighter guns, and enables these heavy guns to be placed\r\n  at a considerably greater height above water than was usual in\r\n  former days, so that the chances of the guns being prevented from\r\n  being fought in heavy weather are diminished, and their power\r\n  as compared with the lower guns in earlier ships is increased,\r\n  especially when firing with depression.\r\n\r\n  “The days of the ‘completely protected iron-clad,’ with the\r\n  broadside armored throughout the length from the upper deck down\r\n  to five or six feet below the water-line, have long gone by.\r\n  The ‘central battery and belt’ system has also been practically\r\n  dropped, whether the battery contained broadside guns or formed a\r\n  citadel protecting the bases of the turrets. In short, on modern\r\n  battle-ships there now remains only a narrow belt of armor, rising\r\n  from five or six feet below the load-line to two or three feet\r\n  above it. This narrow strip of armor in the French ships extends\r\n  from end to end, and is associated with a protective deck worked\r\n  at the height of the top of the belt, and forming a strong roof\r\n  to the hold spaces beneath. In the English ships of the _Admiral_\r\n  class the belt of armor extends somewhat less than half the total\r\n  length, protecting one hundred and forty to one hundred and fifty\r\n  feet of the central portion of the ship (in which are situate\r\n  the engines and boilers), and protecting also the communications\r\n  from the barbette towers to the magazines. At the extremities of\r\n  the belt strong armored bulkheads are built across the ships. The\r\n  protected deck is fitted at the upper edge of the belt over the\r\n  central portion. Before and abaft the bulkheads, where there is\r\n  no side armor, the protection consists of a strong steel deck,\r\n  situated from four to five feet below water, and extending to the\r\n  bow and stern respectively. Upon this under-water deck are placed\r\n  coal-bunkers, chain-lockers, fresh-water tanks, store-rooms, etc.,\r\n  the spaces between it and the deck next above being subdivided into\r\n  a large number of water-tight compartments or cells by means of\r\n  longitudinal and transverse bulkheads. A water-tight top or roof to\r\n  these compartments is formed by plating over the main deck-beams\r\n  with thin steel at the same height above water as the top of the\r\n  armor-belt. In this manner the unarmored ends above the protective\r\n  deck are not merely packed to a large extent with water-excluding\r\n  substances when the vessel is fully laden, but they are minutely\r\n  subdivided into separate compartments, which can only be thrown\r\n  into communication with one another by means of very extensive\r\n  injuries to the partitions.\r\n\r\n  “In all the modern French ships, as well as in the _Admiral_ class,\r\n  a light steel superstructure of considerable height is built above\r\n  the level of the belt-deck; the living quarters of the crew and the\r\n  stations of the auxiliary armament are contained within this light\r\n  erection, which also surrounds the armored communications from the\r\n  barbette towers to the magazines. In this manner a ship with a\r\n  small height of armored freeboard is converted into a high-sided\r\n  ship for all purposes of ordinary navigation, sea-worthiness, and\r\n  habitability; while spaces are provided in which a more or less\r\n  considerable number of light guns can be fought concurrently\r\n  with the heavy guns placed in the armor-protected stations. The\r\n  radical difference, therefore, between the French ships and the\r\n  _Admiral_ class, independently of other considerations than the\r\n  armor protection of the water-line, consists in the omission of\r\n  the side armor at the extremities, and the use instead of the side\r\n  armor of the strong under-water deck with cellular subdivision\r\n  and other arrangements for adding to the protection and securing\r\n  the buoyancy of the spaces at the ends, into which water may\r\n  find access through the thin sides if they are shot through and\r\n  seriously damaged in action. If the completely belted French ship\r\n  has to fight a vessel of the _Admiral_ class, the latter has\r\n  obviously the greater chance of damage to the narrow strips of the\r\n  sides lying above the under-water deck before and abaft the ends\r\n  of the belt. If the action takes place in smooth water, when the\r\n  ships are neither rolling nor pitching, but are simply in motion,\r\n  the chances of hitting these narrow strips in the water-line region\r\n  might not be very great; but it must be admitted that even the\r\n  lightest guns would penetrate the thin sides of the English ships\r\n  and admit more or less considerable quantities of water into the\r\n  ends. If, on the other hand, the fight takes place in a sea-way,\r\n  with the ships lolling and pitching, then the relative importance\r\n  of penetration of these narrow’ strips of the ends of the English\r\n  ships becomes much less, because the belt armor of the French ships\r\n  will be brought out of water for a considerable length of the bow\r\n  and the stern by a very moderate angle of pitching, or by the\r\n  passage of a comparatively low wave, and because rolling motion\r\n  of the ships will alternately immerse or emerge the belt armor,\r\n  even at the midships part, where it has its greatest thickness.\r\n  In fact, as I have more than once said publicly, it is clearly an\r\n  error to limit criticism to the longitudinal extent of the belt\r\n  armor in modern ships, and to exclude consideration of the vertical\r\n  extent of the armor above and below the load-line. Apart from any\r\n  discussion of the question from the artillerist’s point of view,\r\n  or any attempt to determine the probability or otherwise of the\r\n  wholesale destruction of the unarmored portions of modern battle\r\n  ships by shell-fire from large guns, or by the projectiles from\r\n  rapid-firing and machine guns, it is perfectly obvious to any one\r\n  who will examine into the matter that the risk of damage to the\r\n  light superstructures situated above the belt must be greater than\r\n  the corresponding risk of damage to the narrow strips of side area\r\n  exposed at the unarmored ends of the _Admiral_ class, between the\r\n  level of the belt-deck and the water-line.\r\n\r\n  “Sir Spencer Robinson, after his inspection of the models shown\r\n  him at the Admiralty, recognizes the fact that in the French\r\n  belted ships (of which the _Amiral Duperré_ is an example), if the\r\n  light sides above the belt-deck are destroyed or very seriously\r\n  riddled in action, the ship would be capsized in a very moderate\r\n  sea-way. He further emphasizes the statement that the ships of\r\n  the _Admiral_ class in the English navy, if similarly treated,\r\n  would also capsize under the same conditions, and he appears to\r\n  be surprised at the admission having been made. The fact is that\r\n  there has never been any assertion that the _Admiral_ class would\r\n  be safe against capsizing independently of assistance given to the\r\n  armor-belted portions by the unarmored structure situated above.\r\n  On the contrary, from the first, in the design of these ships, it\r\n  was recognized that their stability, in the sense of their power\r\n  to resist being capsized, if inclined to even moderate angles of\r\n  inclination, was not guaranteed by the armor-belts. In this respect\r\n  they were in identically the same position as all other armored\r\n  ships with shallow water-line belts and isolated armored batteries\r\n  placed high above water.\r\n\r\n  “What has been said respecting the _Admiral_ class is this: If the\r\n  unarmored ends above the protective deck were completely thrown\r\n  open to the sea, then the initial stability (that is to say, the\r\n  stiffness of the ships or their power to resist small inclinations\r\n  from the upright) would still be guaranteed by the central armored\r\n  portions. So fully did we appreciate the fact that the life of\r\n  the ship in action (as determined by her power to resist large\r\n  inclinations) depends greatly upon the assistance given by the\r\n  unarmored superstructures to the armor-belted parts, that we were\r\n  careful to make the structural arrangements of the superstructures\r\n  above the belts such that they could bear a very considerable\r\n  amount of riddling and damage from shot and shell without ceasing\r\n  to contribute in the most important degree to the buoyancy and\r\n  stability.\r\n\r\n  “There are double cellular sides between the belt and upper decks;\r\n  the main bulkheads are carried up high above water; hatches and\r\n  openings are trunked up and protected by coffer-dams. In short,\r\n  every possible precaution is taken to subdivide into compartments,\r\n  and thus limit the spaces to which water can find access when the\r\n  outer sides are penetrated or shattered, as well as to facilitate\r\n  the work of stopping temporarily shot-holes in the sides.\r\n\r\n  “Now, without in the least intending to discredit the work of the\r\n  French designers, I have to state that no corresponding or equal\r\n  precautions have been taken in the portions of their ships lying\r\n  above the belt-decks. And the absence of these features in the\r\n  French ships is a great relative advantage to the English ships.\r\n  Of course there is nothing to hinder the French from imitating\r\n  our practice, but they are content to take the risks involved in\r\n  a simpler construction, and in so doing they show their practical\r\n  disbelief in the doctrine of armor-protected stability. I am aware\r\n  that some eminent authorities do not concur with this view, and\r\n  maintain that stability and buoyancy should be guaranteed by armor.\r\n  To this point I will revert hereafter, but for the present I am\r\n  content to say that, as between the French ships and the _Admiral_\r\n  class, the most serious risks of damage by gun-fire in action\r\n  are of the same kind, and, practically, are not affected by the\r\n  shortening of the armor-belts in the English ships.\r\n\r\n  “Next I would refer to the differences which are undoubtedly\r\n  involved in shortening the belts of the English ships. In the\r\n  first place, by dispensing with the side armor towards the\r\n  extremities a very considerable saving is effected in the weight\r\n  and the cost of the armor fitted to the ships. Mr. Barnaby has\r\n  recently given an illustration of this, where a ship, in other\r\n  respects unchanged, has to be increased from 10,000 to 11,000 tons\r\n  in displacement in order to carry the shallow armor-belt to the\r\n  ends. In the _Collingwood_ herself quite as large a proportionate\r\n  increase of size would be involved in having a thick armor-belt\r\n  from stem to stern. This saving in weight and cost of armor might,\r\n  of course, be purchased too dearly, if dispensing with the armor\r\n  involved possibly fatal risks to the ship. However the result\r\n  may be attained, there is universal agreement that a ship-of-war\r\n  should have her buoyancy, stability, and trim guaranteed as far\r\n  as possible against the effects of damage in action. Now, in the\r\n  _Admiral_ class this matter was very carefully investigated before\r\n  the design was approved. In order to prevent derangement of the\r\n  trim of the vessels by penetration of the light sides above the\r\n  protective deck at one end, arrangements were made in the design by\r\n  means of which water can be introduced into the spaces occupied by\r\n  coal-bunkers, etc., before the ships go into action.\r\n\r\n  “The extent to which water may be introduced is a matter over which\r\n  the captain would necessarily have control. But even if the whole\r\n  of the unoccupied spaces were filled with water, the increase in\r\n  draught would not exceed fourteen to eighteen inches, and the loss\r\n  in speed would not exceed half a knot. If only the coal-bunkers\r\n  were flooded as a preliminary to action, the chance of any serious\r\n  disturbance of trim, and consequent loss of manœuvring power or\r\n  speed by damage to the light sides above the protective deck and\r\n  near the water, would be very small, and the ‘sinkage’ of the\r\n  vessel would be decreased considerably. But taking the extreme\r\n  case, with the ends completely filled and a sinkage of fourteen to\r\n  eighteen inches, a ship of the _Admiral_ class would go into action\r\n  with practically her full speed available, and with her ends so\r\n  protected by under-water deck and the water admitted above that\r\n  deck that damage to the thin sides by shot or shell penetrating\r\n  at or near the water-line would not produce changes of trim or\r\n  alterations of draught to any greater extent than would be produced\r\n  if the armor-belt had been carried to the stem and stern. Nor would\r\n  the admission of water into the ends render the vessel unstable.\r\n\r\n  “It has been urged that the sinkage due to filling the tank ends\r\n  with water is a disadvantage, because it brings the upper edge of\r\n  the belt armor in the _Admiral_ class about fourteen to eighteen\r\n  inches nearer the water than the upper edge of the belts of the\r\n  French ships. If the greatest danger of the ships was to be\r\n  measured by the smallness of their ‘reserve’ of ‘armor-protected\r\n  buoyancy’ (that is to say, by the buoyancy of the part of the ship\r\n  lying above her fighting water-line and below the belt-deck), then\r\n  the _Admiral_ class would not compare favorably with the fully\r\n  belted French ships. But I have already explained that this is not\r\n  the true measure of the greatest danger arising from the effects of\r\n  gun-fire, and that it would be a mistake to assume that in either\r\n  the French or the English ships the armor-belted portions of the\r\n  vessels guarantee their safety when damaged in action.\r\n\r\n  “As between the _Admiral_ class and the central-citadel ships\r\n  of the _Inflexible_ type there is a difference in this respect\r\n  which has been much commented upon. When the ends of the citadel\r\n  ships are filled with water, the armored wall of the citadel\r\n  still remains several feet above water; whereas, in the _Admiral_\r\n  class, the top of the belt under similar conditions is very near\r\n  the water-level. All that need be said on this point is that,\r\n  notwithstanding the greater height of the armored wall above water,\r\n  the citadel ships have practically no greater guarantee of safety\r\n  against capsizing by means of armor-protected stability than the\r\n  _Admiral_ class. In both classes the armored portions require the\r\n  assistance of the unarmored to secure such a range and amount\r\n  of stability as shall effectually guarantee their security when\r\n  damaged in action. And, as has been stated above, this condition is\r\n  true of all armor-clads with narrow armor-belts.\r\n\r\n  “One other objection to the shortened belts yet remains to be\r\n  considered.\r\n\r\n  “It is urged that when the thin ends are broken through or damaged\r\n  by shot or shell, jagged or protruding holes will be formed in\r\n  the plating near the water-line, and then if the ships are driven\r\n  at speed, the water will flow into the holes in large quantities,\r\n  and produce serious changes of trim and loss of speed. In support\r\n  of this contention, reference is made to the published reports of\r\n  experiments made with the _Inflexible’s_ model about eight years\r\n  ago. It is impossible to discuss the matter fully, and I must\r\n  therefore content myself with a statement of my opinion, formed\r\n  after a careful personal observation of these model experiments.\r\n  First, it cannot be shown from the experiments that the presence\r\n  of a shallow belt of armor reaching two to three feet above the\r\n  still-water line would make any sensible difference in the dangers\r\n  arising from the circumstances described. Holes in the thin sides\r\n  above this belt would admit water in large quantities on the\r\n  belt-deck when the vessel was under way, and if it could flow along\r\n  that deck changes of trim and other disagreeable consequences would\r\n  result. Secondly, it is certain that the numerous bulkheads and\r\n  partitions, coffer-dams, etc., built above the belt-deck level in\r\n  the _Admiral_ class for the very purpose of limiting the flow of\r\n  entering water would greatly decrease any tendency to check the\r\n  speed or change the trim. Whether the belt be short or long, it is\r\n  evident that gaping holes low down in the light sides will make it\r\n  prudent for a captain to slow down somewhat if he wishes to keep\r\n  the water out as much as possible. But between such prudence and\r\n  the danger of disaster there is a wide gulf.\r\n\r\n  “Summing up the foregoing statements, I desire to record my\r\n  opinion, based upon complete personal knowledge of every detail\r\n  in the calculations and designs for the _Admiral_ class, that the\r\n  disposition of the belt armor (in association with the protective\r\n  decks and cellular sides, water-tight subdivision, etc., existing\r\n  in the unarmored portions of the vessels situated above the\r\n  protective decks) is such that the buoyancy, stability, trim,\r\n  speed, and manœuvring capabilities are well guaranteed against\r\n  extensive damage from shot and shell fire in action. And, further,\r\n  that in these particulars the _Admiral_ class are capable of\r\n  meeting, at least on equal terms, their contemporary ships in the\r\n  French navy.\r\n\r\n  “I must add that I am not here instituting any comparison between\r\n  the ‘fighting efficiencies’ of the ships of the two fleets; nor\r\n  have I space in this letter to do so. Opinions have differed, and\r\n  will probably always differ, as to the relative importance of the\r\n  different qualities which go to make up fighting efficiency. There\r\n  is no simple formula admitting of general application which enables\r\n  the comparative fighting values of war-ships to be appraised.\r\n  As the conditions of naval warfare change and war material is\r\n  developed, so the balance of qualities in ship-designing has to be\r\n  readjusted, and estimates of the fighting powers of existing ships\r\n  have to be revised. And, further, different designers, working\r\n  simultaneously, distribute the displacement, which is their sum\r\n  total of capital to work upon, according to their own judgments of\r\n  what is wisest and best for the particular conditions which the\r\n  ships built from those designs have to fulfil. The designer who has\r\n  the larger displacement to work upon has the better opportunity of\r\n  producing a more powerful ship; but it by no means follows that he\r\n  will secure so good a combination of qualities as a rival obtains\r\n  on a smaller displacement. And hence I cannot but dissent from the\r\n  doctrine that displacement tonnage is to be accepted as a fair\r\n  measure of relative fighting efficiency, or that recent English\r\n  ships are necessarily unable to fight recent French ships because\r\n  they are of smaller displacement.\r\n\r\n  “In the preceding remarks I have been careful to confine myself\r\n  chiefly to the naval architect’s side of the subject, as it\r\n  would clearly be out of place for me to say much respecting the\r\n  artillerist’s side. But, having had the great advantage of knowing\r\n  the views of some of the most experienced gun-makers and gunnery\r\n  officers, and having studied carefully what has been written on the\r\n  subject, I would venture to say a few words.\r\n\r\n  “First, there seems, as was previously remarked, every reason\r\n  for doubting, in the actual conditions of naval gunnery, whether\r\n  it would be possible, not merely in a few minutes, but in a\r\n  considerable time, to produce the wholesale destruction of the\r\n  unarmored parts of modern war-ships which has been assumed in\r\n  the condemnation of the _Admiral_ class. If the _Collingwood_,\r\n  or one of her successors, were simply treated as a moving target\r\n  in a sea-way for the _Amiral Duperré_ or one of her consorts,\r\n  this would be a most improbable result. But, remembering that the\r\n  _Collingwood_ would herself be delivering heavy blows in return for\r\n  those received, the chances of her disablement would necessarily\r\n  be decreased. Secondly, it does not seem at all evident that the\r\n  introduction of rapid-fire guns has such an important influence on\r\n  the question of shortened belts as some writers have supposed. So\r\n  far as machine guns are concerned, I well remember at the board\r\n  meeting which decided to approve the building of the _Collingwood_\r\n  the possible effects of machine-gun fire were discussed at some\r\n  length, both in reference to the adoption of the barbette system\r\n  and to the system of hull protection. The rapid-firing gun which\r\n  has since been introduced is now a formidable weapon; but it may\r\n  be questioned whether its effects upon the unarmored portions of\r\n  modern war-ships would be so serious as those resulting from the\r\n  shell-fire of heavier guns, and therefore it cannot with certainty\r\n  be concluded that it would be advantageous to make arrangements\r\n  for keeping out the projectiles from the rapid-firing guns now in\r\n  use at the ends of the _Admiral_ class. More especially is this\r\n  true when it is considered that already rapid-fire guns of much\r\n  larger calibre and greater power than the 6-pounder and 9-pounder\r\n  are being made. To these guns three inches of steel would be\r\n  practically no better defence than the existing thin sides, and\r\n  the real defence lies in the strong protective deck. Shell-fire\r\n  from heavier guns will probably be found the best form of attack\r\n  against the unarmored or lightly armored portions of battle-ships,\r\n  especially now that the use of steel shells with thin walls and\r\n  large bursting charges is being so rapidly developed.\r\n\r\n  “I would again say that on this side of the subject I do not\r\n  profess to speak with authority, and it is undoubted that great\r\n  differences of opinion prevail; but it must not be forgotten\r\n  that the Board of Admiralty, by its recent decision announced\r\n  in the House of Commons, has reaffirmed the opinion that from\r\n  the artillerist’s point of view the existing disposition of the\r\n  armor in the _Admiral_ class is satisfactory. This has been done\r\n  after the attention of the Board and the public has been most\r\n  strongly directed to the supposed dangers incidental to the\r\n  rapid destruction of the light superstructures lying above the\r\n  under-water decks of the _Admiral_ class. It would be folly to\r\n  suppose that in such a matter any merely personal considerations\r\n  would prevent the Board from authorizing a change which was proved\r\n  to be necessary or advantageous. With respect to the possibility\r\n  of making experiments which should determine the points at issue,\r\n  I would only say that considerable difficulties must necessarily\r\n  arise in endeavoring to represent the conditions of an actual\r\n  fight; but in view of the diametrically opposite views which\r\n  have been expressed as to the effect of gun-fire upon cellular\r\n  structures, it would certainly be advantageous if some scheme of\r\n  the kind could be arranged.\r\n\r\n  “There still remains to be considered the question of the uses of\r\n  armor in future war-ships. This letter has already extended to too\r\n  great a length to permit of any attempt at a full discussion. It\r\n  will be admitted by all who are interested in the questions of\r\n  naval design that an inquiry into the matter is urgently needed,\r\n  even if it leads only to a temporary solution of the problem, in\r\n  view of the present means of offence and defence.\r\n\r\n  “Armor, by which term I understand not merely vertical armor,\r\n  but oblique or horizontal armor, is regarded in different ways\r\n  by different authorities. For example, I understand Sir Edward\r\n  Reed to maintain that side-armor should be fitted in the form of\r\n  a water-line belt, extending over a very considerable portion of\r\n  the length, and that such armor, in association with a strong\r\n  protective deck, and armored erections for gun-stations, etc.,\r\n  should secure the buoyancy, trim, and stability of the vessel.\r\n  At the other extreme we have the view expressed in the design\r\n  of the grand Italian vessels of the _Italia_ class. In them the\r\n  hull-armor is only used for the purpose of assisting the cellular\r\n  hull subdivisions in protecting buoyancy, stability, and trim,\r\n  taking the form of a thick protective deck, which is wholly under\r\n  water, and above which comes a minutely subdivided region, which\r\n  Signor Brin and his colleagues consider sufficient defence against\r\n  gun-fire.\r\n\r\n  “In these Italian vessels the only thick armor is used to protect\r\n  the gun-stations, the pilot-tower, and the communications from\r\n  those important parts to the magazines and spaces below the\r\n  protective deck. The strong deck, besides forming a base of the\r\n  cellular subdivision, is of course a defence to the vital parts of\r\n  the ship lying below it.\r\n\r\n  “Between these two types of ships come the _Admiral_ class of the\r\n  English navy and the belted vessels of the French navy, whose\r\n  resemblances and differences have been described above.\r\n\r\n  “In addition, there are not a few authorities who maintain that the\r\n  development of the swift torpedo-cruiser, or the swift protected\r\n  cruiser, makes the continued use of armor at least questionable,\r\n  seeing that to attempt to protect ships by thick armor either on\r\n  decks or sides, and to secure high speeds and heavy armaments,\r\n  involves the construction of large and expensive vessels, which\r\n  are necessarily exposed to enormous risks in action from forms\r\n  of under-water attack, against which their armor is no defence.\r\n  In view of such differences of opinion, and of the heated\r\n  controversies which have arisen therefrom, the time seems certainly\r\n  to have arrived when some competent body should be assembled\r\n  by the Admiralty for the purpose of considering the designs of\r\n  our war-ships, and enabling our constructors to proceed with\r\n  greater assurance than they can at present. Questions affecting\r\n  the efficiency of the Royal Navy clearly ought not to be decided\r\n  except in the most calm and dispassionate manner. The work done\r\n  by the Committee on Designs for Ships of War fourteen years ago\r\n  was valuable, and has had important results. What is now wanted,\r\n  I venture to think, is a still wider inquiry into the condition\r\n  of the navy, and one of the branches of that inquiry which will\r\n  require the most careful treatment is embraced in the question,\r\n  ‘What are the uses of armor in modern war-ships?’\r\n\r\n  “My own opinion, reached after very careful study of the subject,\r\n  is that very serious limitations have to be accepted in the\r\n  disposition and general efficiency of the armaments, if the\r\n  principle of protecting the stability at considerable angles of\r\n  inclination by means of thick armor is accepted, the size and\r\n  cost of the ships being kept within reasonable limits. There is\r\n  no difficulty, of course, apart from considerations of size and\r\n  cost, in fulfilling the condition of armor-protected stability; but\r\n  it may be doubted whether the results could prove satisfactory,\r\n  especially when the risks from under-water attacks, as well as\r\n  from gun-fire, are borne in mind, and the fact is recognized that\r\n  even the thickest armor carried or contemplated is not proof\r\n  against existing guns. No vessel can fight without running risks.\r\n  It is by no means certain, however, that the greater risks to be\r\n  faced are those arising from damage to the sides in the region\r\n  of the water-line and consequent loss of stability. So far as I\r\n  have been able to judge, it appears possible to produce a better\r\n  fighting-machine for a given cost by abandoning the idea of\r\n  protecting stability, buoyancy, and trim entirely by thick armor,\r\n  and by the acceptance of the principle that unarmored but specially\r\n  constructed superstructures shall be trusted as contributories to\r\n  the flotation and stability. Thick vertical side armor, even over\r\n  a portion of the length, appears to be by no means a necessary\r\n  condition to an effective guarantee of the life and manageability\r\n  of a ship when damaged in action; and it seems extremely probable\r\n  that in future the great distinction between battle-ships and\r\n  protected ships will not be found in the nature of their hull\r\n  protection in the region of the water-line, but in the use of thick\r\n  armor over the stations of the heavy guns in battle-ships.\r\n\r\n  “The decisions as to future designs of our battle-ships is a\r\n  momentous one. It can only be reached by the consideration of the\r\n  relative advantages and disadvantages of alternative proposals. It\r\n  cannot be dissociated from considerations of cost for a single ship.\r\n\r\n  “On all grounds, therefore, it is to be hoped that a full and\r\n  impartial inquiry will be authorized without delay; for it may be\r\n  assumed that, however opinions differ, there is the common desire\r\n  to secure for the British navy the best types of ships and a\r\n  sufficient number to insure our maritime supremacy.\r\n\r\n                                  I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n                                                         “W. H. WHITE.\r\n\r\n  “ELSWICK WORKS, _March 26th_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following reply by Sir Edward Reed appeared in the _Times_ of\r\nApril 8, 1885, the omitted portions being personal allusions which\r\nhave very little bearing upon the discussion, and which are of no\r\ninterest to a professional reader outside of England:\r\n\r\n  “It is not Mr. White’s fault but his misfortune that he is\r\n  compelled to admit the perfect correctness of the main charge which\r\n  I have brought against these six ships, _viz._, that they have been\r\n  so constructed, and have been so stripped of armor protection, that\r\n  their armor, even when intact and untouched, is wholly insufficient\r\n  to prevent them from capsizing in battle. Mr. White expends a\r\n  good deal of labor in attempting to show that their unarmored\r\n  parts would have a better chance of keeping the ships upright and\r\n  afloat than I credit them with, which is a secondary, although an\r\n  important, question; but he frankly admits that these six ships of\r\n  the _Admiral_ type are, and are admitted to be, so built that their\r\n  ‘stability in the sense of the power to resist being capsized if\r\n  inclined to even moderate angles of inclination is not guaranteed\r\n  by their armor-belts.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “I have no doubt it would suit the purposes of all those who are\r\n  or who have been responsible for those ships if I were to allow\r\n  myself to be drawn, in connection with this question, away from\r\n  the essential points just adverted to into a controversy upon the\r\n  efforts made by the Admiralty to give to these ships, which have\r\n  been denied a reasonable amount of armor protection, such relief\r\n  from the grave dangers thus incurred as thin sheet compartments,\r\n  coffer-dams, coals, patent fuel, stores, etc., can afford. (Cork\r\n  is what was at first relied upon in this connection, but we hear\r\n  no more of it now.) But I do not intend to be drawn aside from\r\n  my demand for properly armored ships of the first class by any\r\n  references to these devices, and for a very simple reason, _viz._,\r\n  all such devices, whether their value be great or small, are in no\r\n  sense special to armored ships; on the contrary they are common\r\n  to all ships, and are more especially applied to ships which are\r\n  unable to carry armor. The application of these devices to ships\r\n  stripped of armor does not make them armored ships, any more than\r\n  it makes a simple cruiser or other ordinary unarmored vessel an\r\n  armored ship; and what I desire, and what I confidently rely upon\r\n  the country demanding before long, is the construction of a few\r\n  line-of-battle ships made reasonably safe by armor, in lieu of the\r\n  present ships, which, while called armored ships, in reality depend\r\n  upon their thin unarmored parts for their ability to keep upright\r\n  and afloat. Besides, I do not believe in these devices for ships\r\n  intended for close fighting. I even believe them likely, in not a\r\n  few cases, to add to their danger rather than to their safety. If,\r\n  for example, a raking shot or shell should let the sea into the\r\n  compartments on one side of the ship, while those on the other side\r\n  remain intact and buoyant, this very buoyancy upon the uninjured\r\n  side of the ship would help to capsize her.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. White says that no vessel can fight without running risks,\r\n  and thinks that thick, vertical side-armor, even over a portion\r\n  of the ship’s length, is not a necessary guarantee of the life of\r\n  a ship. Well, sir, we are all at liberty to think, or not think,\r\n  what we please, so far as our sense and judgment will allow us;\r\n  but Mr. White, like all other depreciators of side-armor, fails\r\n  utterly to show us what else there is which can be relied upon to\r\n  keep shell out of a ship, or what can be done to prevent shell\r\n  that burst inside a ship from spreading destruction all around. He\r\n  refers us to no experiments to show that the thin plate divisions\r\n  and coffer-dams, and like devices, will prove of any avail for\r\n  the purpose proposed. In the absence of any such experiments, he\r\n  tells us, as others have told us, that Signor Brin and colleagues\r\n  in the Italian Admiralty consider ‘a minutely subdivided region’\r\n  at and below the water-line ‘sufficient defence against gun-fire.’\r\n  But I do not think Signor Brin believes anything of the kind; what\r\n  he believes is that the Italian government cannot afford to build\r\n  a fleet of properly armored line-of-battle ships for hard and\r\n  close fighting, and that, looking at their limited resources, a\r\n  few excessively fast ships, with armor here and there to protect\r\n  particular parts, and with ample capabilities of retreat to a safe\r\n  distance, will best serve their purpose. I do not say that he is\r\n  wrong, and I certainly admire the skill which he has displayed in\r\n  carrying out his well-defined object. But that object is totally\r\n  different from ours, and our naval habits, our traditions, our\r\n  national spirit, the very blood that flows in our veins, prevent\r\n  such an object from ever becoming ours.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. White all through his letter, in common with some of his late\r\n  colleagues at the Admiralty, thinks and speaks as if naval warfare\r\n  were henceforth to be chiefly a matter of dodging, getting chance\r\n  shots, and keeping out of the enemy’s way; and this may be more or\r\n  less true of contests between unarmored vessels. But why is not the\r\n  line-of-battle ship _Collingwood_ to be supposed to steam straight\r\n  up to the enemy, I should like to know? and if she does, what is\r\n  to prevent the enemy from pouring a raking fire through her bow,\r\n  and ripping up at once, even with a single shell, every compartment\r\n  between the stem and the transverse armored bulkhead?\r\n\r\n  “It distresses me beyond measure to see our ships constructed so\r\n  as to impose upon them the most terrible penalties whenever their\r\n  commanders dare, as dare they ever have, and dare they ever will,\r\n  to close with their foe and try conclusions with him. Why, sir,\r\n  it has been my painful duty over and over again to hear foreign\r\n  officers entreat me to use all my influence against the adoption in\r\n  their navy of ships with so little armored surface as ours. On one\r\n  occasion the _Collingwood_ herself was imposed upon them as a model\r\n  to be imitated, and I was besought to give them a safer and better\r\n  ship. ‘How could I ever steam up to my enemy with any confidence,’\r\n  said one of the officers concerned, ‘with such a ship as that under\r\n  my feet?’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “Mr. White coolly tells us that the _Collingwood_, with five\r\n  hundred tons of water logging her ends to a depth of seven or eight\r\n  feet, will not be much worse off than a ship whose armored deck\r\n  stands two and a half or three feet above the water’s surface,\r\n  and his reason is that even above this latter deck the water\r\n  would flow in when the ship was driving ahead with an injured\r\n  bow. Well, sir, I will only say that sailors of experience see a\r\n  very great difference between the two cases, and I can but regard\r\n  such theorizings as very unfortunate basis for the designs of her\r\n  Majesty’s ships.\r\n\r\n  “I have said that Mr. White’s assumptions as to the immunity of the\r\n  above-water compartments and coffer-dams from wide-spread injury\r\n  by shell-fire rest upon no experimental data; I go on to say that\r\n  such data as we have to my mind point very much the other way. The\r\n  _Huascar_ was not an unarmored vessel, and such shell as penetrated\r\n  her had first to pass through some thin armor and wood backing; yet\r\n  after the _Cochrane_ and _Blanco Encaloda_ had defeated her she\r\n  presented internally abundant evidence of the general destruction\r\n  which shell-fire produces. An officer of the _Cochrane_, who was\r\n  the first person sent on board by the captors, in a letter to me\r\n  written soon afterwards, said: ‘It requires seeing to believe the\r\n  destruction done.... We had to climb over heaps, table-high, of\r\n  _débris_ and dead and wounded.... We fired forty-five Palliser\r\n  shell, and the engineers who were on board say that every shell, or\r\n  nearly so, must have struck, and that every one that struck burst\r\n  on board, doing awful destruction.’\r\n\r\n  “Speaking of the injury which the _Cochrane_ received from a single\r\n  shell of the _Huascar_, he said: ‘It passed through the upper works\r\n  at commander’s cabin, breaking fore and aft bulkhead of cabins,\r\n  breaking skylight above ward-room, thwartship bulkhead of wood,\r\n  passed on, cut in two a 5-inch iron pillar, through a store-room,\r\n  struck armor-plate, glanced off, passing through plating of\r\n  embrasure closet at corner, finishing at after gun-port, and went\r\n  overboard. This shell passed in at starboard part of stern and\r\n  terminated at after battery port on port side, which is finished\r\n  with the wide angle-iron, carrying out a part of the angle-iron in\r\n  its flight.’\r\n\r\n  “This was a shell of moderate size, from a moderate gun, but it is\r\n  obvious that it would have made short work of penetrating those\r\n  very thin sheets of steel which constitute the compartments,\r\n  coffer-dams, etc., upon the resistance of which, to my extreme\r\n  surprise, those responsible for the power and safety of our fleets\r\n  seem so ready to place their main dependence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “For resistance to rams and torpedoes, and for the limitation of\r\n  the injuries to be effected by them, as much cellular subdivision\r\n  as possible should be supplied; but, as against shot and shell,\r\n  subdivision by their sheet-steel is no guarantee whatever of safety\r\n  in any ship, least of all in line-of-battle ships, which must be\r\n  prepared for fighting at close quarters.\r\n\r\n  “I must now ask for space to remark upon a few minor points in\r\n  Mr. White’s letter. He seems to consider that the scant armor\r\n  of the _Admiral_ class is somehow associated with the placing\r\n  of the large, partly protected guns of these ships in separate\r\n  positions, ‘in order to reduce the risks of complete disablement\r\n  of the principal armament by one or two lucky shots, which may\r\n  happen when the heavy guns are concentrated on a single citadel\r\n  or battery.’ Suffice it to reply that in the proposed new designs\r\n  of the Admiralty ships now before Parliament, which have almost\r\n  equally scant partial belts of armor, the guns are nevertheless\r\n  concentrated in a single battery.\r\n\r\n  “Again, Mr. White says the Admiralty have declined to adopt\r\n  my advice to protect the _Admiral_ class in certain unarmored\r\n  parts with 3-inch plating, and declares that such plating would\r\n  practically be no better defence against rapid-fire guns than\r\n  existing thin sides; but has he forgotten the fact that my\r\n  suggestion has been adopted in the new designs for the protection\r\n  of the battery of 6-inch guns, although it is perversely withheld\r\n  from those parts of the ship in which it might assist in some\r\n  degree in prolonging the ship’s ability to float and to resist\r\n  capsizing forces?\r\n\r\n  “Mr. White makes one very singular statement. He takes exception\r\n  to my claiming for the _Inflexible_ type of ship, on account of\r\n  their armored citadel, a much better chance of retaining stability\r\n  in battle than the _Admiral_ type possesses, because, he says, ‘in\r\n  both classes the armored portions require the assistance of the\r\n  unarmored to secure such a range and amount of stability as shall\r\n  effectually guarantee their security when damaged in action.’\r\n  The fair inference to be drawn from this would be that where the\r\n  principle long ago laid down by me, and supported by Mr. Barnaby in\r\n  the words previously quoted, is once departed from, the danger must\r\n  in all cases be so great as to exclude all distinctions of more or\r\n  less risk. Mr. White can hardly mean this; but if he does not, then\r\n  on what grounds are we told that a ship which has no armor at all\r\n  left above water at an inclination say of six or eight degrees is\r\n  no worse off than a ship which at those angles and at still greater\r\n  ones has a water-tight citadel over one hundred feet long to help\r\n  hold her up?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “I am not at all disposed to enter into a discussion as to the\r\n  relative stabilities of the English and French ships under various\r\n  conditions. The French ships have armored belts two and a half to\r\n  three feet above water from end to end. That fact, other things\r\n  being presumed equal, gives them an immense advantage over our\r\n  ships, which in battle trim have belts scarcely more than a foot\r\n  wide above water, and for less than half their length. It is quite\r\n  possible that the French constructors may have given their ships\r\n  less initial stability than ours; from such information as I\r\n  possess I believe they have; but in so far as the ship below the\r\n  armor-deck, and the action of shot and shell upon that part of her,\r\n  are concerned, whatever stability they start with in battle they\r\n  will retain until their armor is pierced; whereas our ships may\r\n  have a large proportion of theirs taken from them without their\r\n  armor being pierced, and their armored decks are then less than\r\n  half the height of those of the French ships above water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “I will add that I doubt if the French ships are dealt fairly by at\r\n  Whitehall. I lately heard a good deal of the extreme taper of their\r\n  armor-belts at the bow, and the _Amiral Duperré_ was always quoted\r\n  in instance of this. It is true that this ship’s armor does taper\r\n  from fifty-five centimetres amidships to twenty-five centimetres at\r\n  the stem, but she stands almost alone among recent important ships\r\n  in this respect, as the following figures will show:\r\n\r\n    +------------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n    |                  | Thickness    | Thickness    |\r\n    | NAME OF SHIP.    | of Armor     | of Armor     |\r\n    |                  | Amidship.    | at Bows.     |\r\n    +------------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n    |                  | Centimetres. | Centimetres. |\r\n    | Amiral Baudin    |      55      |      40      |\r\n    | Formidable       |      55      |      40      |\r\n    | Hoche            |      45      |      40      |\r\n    | Magenta          |      45      |      40      |\r\n    | Marceau          |      45      |      40      |\r\n    | Caiman           |      50      |      35      |\r\n    | Fulminant        |      33      |      25      |\r\n    | Furieuse         |      50      |      32      |\r\n    | Indomptable      |      50      |      37      |\r\n    | Requin           |      50      |      40      |\r\n    | Terrible         |      50      |      37      |\r\n    +------------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n  “A friend writes me: ‘Comparing the _Amiral Duperré_ with the\r\n  _Amiral Baudin_, _Dévastation_, _Formidable_, and _Foudroyant_,\r\n  which are ships of about her size, the following peculiarities\r\n  are observable: The _Duperré_ is about three feet narrower than\r\n  the other ships mentioned, and has fully fifteen inches less\r\n  metacentric height. She is also slightly deeper in proportion to\r\n  her breadth than the other ships.’\r\n\r\n  “As narrowness, small metacentric height, and excessive depth\r\n  all tend to reduce stability, it would appear that the Admiralty\r\n  office has, as I supposed, been careful to select a vessel not\r\n  unfavorable to their purpose. But however this may be, it is no\r\n  business of mine to defend the French ships in the details of their\r\n  stability, nor even to defend them at all; and, as a matter of\r\n  fact, the French Admiralty, although stopping far short of ours,\r\n  has in my opinion gone much too far in the direction of reducing\r\n  the armored stability at considerable angles of inclination. But\r\n  their falling into one error is no justification for our falling\r\n  into a much greater one, and deliberately repeating it in every\r\n  ship we lay down. In this connection I will only add that the\r\n  experiments performed at our Admiralty on models must be viewed\r\n  with great distrust for a reason not yet named. They deal only, so\r\n  far as I am acquainted with them, with models set oscillating or\r\n  rolling by waves or otherwise. But the danger thus dealt with is a\r\n  secondary one; the primary one is that due to ‘list’ or prolonged\r\n  inclination to one side. What sort of protection against the danger\r\n  of capsizing from this cause can be possessed by a ship the entire\r\n  armor on each side of which becomes immersed even in smooth water\r\n  when the ship is inclined a couple of degrees only, and which then\r\n  has no side left to immerse, save such as single shells can blow\r\n  into holes ten by four feet?\r\n\r\n  “It is to be observed that although Mr. White does not venture\r\n  to join the only other apologist for these deficiently armored\r\n  ships in stating that India-rubber umbrella shot-stoppers are to\r\n  be employed for their preservation in battle, he does go so far\r\n  as to tell us that the spaces into which water would enter when\r\n  the unarmored parts have been penetrated have been subdivided ‘to\r\n  facilitate the work of stopping temporarily shot-holes in the\r\n  sides,’ and I know independently that a good deal of reliance is\r\n  placed at the Admiralty upon the presumed ability to stop such\r\n  holes as they are made. But the whole thing is a delusion. The\r\n  officer of the _Cochrane_, before quoted, said, ‘I wish to state\r\n  that shot-plugs are out of the question after or at such a fight.\r\n  They are entirely useless. Not a hole was either round, square, or\r\n  oval, but different shapes—ragged, jagged, and torn, the inside\r\n  parts and half-inch plating being torn in ribbons; some of the\r\n  holes inside are as large as four by three feet, and of all shapes.\r\n  There are many shot-plugs on board here, all sizes, conical shapes\r\n  and long, but they are of no use whatever.’\r\n\r\n  “Mr. White’s letter invites many other comments, but I have said\r\n  enough to show that it in no way changes my view of the question\r\n  of armor-plated line-of-battle ships. In so far as it advocates\r\n  a further abandonment of armor and a further resort to doubtful\r\n  devices in lieu thereof, it is already answered by anticipation\r\n  by the Admiralty itself. Until I wrote my recent letters to you,\r\n  our Admiralty thought as Mr. White still thinks, and tended as\r\n  he still tends. In the case of all our recent cruisers but two\r\n  they had abolished side-armor altogether. To my public appeal\r\n  for armor-belted cruisers they have, however, responded, and are\r\n  about to order six of such ships. So far, so good. We ought to be\r\n  grateful for this concession to a most reasonable demand. I wish\r\n  these cruisers were to be faster, much faster, but in Admiralty\r\n  matters the country must be thankful for small mercies.\r\n\r\n  “It only remains for me to note with satisfaction one or two of\r\n  the points upon which Mr. White is in agreement with myself. He\r\n  admits that it ‘would certainly be advantageous’ to carry out those\r\n  experiments which I regard the Admiralty as afraid to make, _viz._,\r\n  experiments to test the effect of gun-fire upon the subdivided but\r\n  unarmored parts of ships.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “It may be taken for what it is worth, but I declare that the\r\n  abandonment of armor has not at all been forced upon us by\r\n  unavoidable circumstances, nor is it from any intrinsic necessity\r\n  that we go on refusing to provide our ships with torpedo defence.\r\n  On not immoderate dimensions, at not immoderate cost, ships might\r\n  be built, still practically invulnerable to gun, ram, and torpedo\r\n  alike, ships which could dispose of the _Admiral_ class of ships\r\n  more quickly and certainly than she could dispose of the feeblest\r\n  antagonist that she is likely to encounter. But in order to\r\n  produce such ships we must revive the now abandoned principle that\r\n  armor, and armor alone can save from destruction those ships whose\r\n  business it is to drive our future enemies from the European seas\r\n  and lock them up in their own ports.”\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Designs of 1872, previously alluded to, contained\r\nsixteen members, of whom six were naval officers. Two of those\r\nmembers, Admiral George Elliot, R.N., and Rear-admiral A. P. Ryder,\r\nR.N., dissented so far from their colleagues that they could not\r\nsign the report, and accordingly they submitted a very able minority\r\nreport embodying their views.\r\n\r\nThe first of the “general principles” laid down in their report is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  “That it is of the last importance that the modifications in\r\n  existing types of men-of-war which the committee have been invited\r\n  to suggest should be calculated not merely to effectually meet the\r\n  necessities of naval warfare now and in the immediate future, but\r\n  in full view of the probable necessities of naval warfare in the\r\n  more remote future.”\r\n\r\nIt must be a source of satisfaction to these gallant officers to\r\nobserve in some designs of the present day a confirmation of their\r\nforecast in many particulars.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from a letter bearing upon the present\r\ncontroversy, by Admiral Elliot, appeared in the _Times_ (London) of\r\nApril 24, 1885, and contain the pith of his oft-quoted arguments:\r\n\r\n  “My first impression on reading these letters in the _Times_ is one\r\n  of disappointment that the point at issue between these two experts\r\n  has not been more closely confined to the comparative merits of\r\n  side-armor _versus_ cellular-deck armor, but that their attention\r\n  has been directed to this feature of design only as connected with\r\n  a particular type of ship, namely, the _Collingwood_, which vessel\r\n  is a hybrid, or cross between the two systems of protection to\r\n  buoyancy, and therefore not truly representative of either. Mr.\r\n  White’s defence of the unarmored ends of the _Collingwood_ is so\r\n  far unsatisfactory that it treats of a very imperfect development\r\n  of the cellular-deck mode of protection, and therefore he is not an\r\n  exponent of the real merits of this system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “I am quite aware that the main point at issue between these two\r\n  distinguished naval architects has been more closely confined to\r\n  the question of stability than to that of flotation as displayed in\r\n  the design of the _Collingwood_, and in this scientific view of the\r\n  case I do not feel competent to offer any opinion, except to point\r\n  out that the cellular-deck principle _per se_ does not involve any\r\n  such danger as regards stability as is produced by the top weight\r\n  of a central citadel. Mr. White acknowledges that this top weight\r\n  will capsize his ship if deprived of the buoyancy afforded by the\r\n  unarmored ends, and on this danger point Sir Edward Reed fixes his\r\n  sharpest weapon of attack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “The great issue at stake is how the weights available for the\r\n  protection of buoyancy and for gun defence are to be distributed to\r\n  the best advantage for defensive purposes, and in order to discuss\r\n  Sir Edward Reed’s opinions in a concise form I will deal with the\r\n  question solely as concerning the use of side-armor of less than\r\n  twelve inches, beyond which limit of thickness I will, for the\r\n  sake of argument, admit its practical advantages; and looking to\r\n  the demand for increased speed and coal-carrying capacity, it does\r\n  not appear probable that if combined with adequate gun protection,\r\n  and if of sufficient depth, an all-round belt of thicker than\r\n  ten inches can be carried by any vessels of war except those of\r\n  much greater displacement than the _Collingwood_ class. I feel\r\n  justified, however, in discussing the question on this basis,\r\n  because Sir Edward Reed includes in his category of approved\r\n  armored ships our recent belted cruisers, having a narrow belt of\r\n  ten inches maximum thickness, and takes credit for having induced\r\n  the Admiralty to abandon their original intention of cellular-deck\r\n  water-line protection in this class of war-ship in favor of this\r\n  thin armor-belt.\r\n\r\n  “The relative value of these two systems of water-line protection,\r\n  namely, an all-round belt _versus_ a raft body, must not only be\r\n  ruled by the displacement decided upon for each class of vessel,\r\n  and by the power of the gun which has to be encountered, but by\r\n  such tactical expedients as can be resorted to in battle, as being\r\n  those best suited to the known offensive and defensive properties\r\n  of the combatants.\r\n\r\n  “Looking at this disputed question entirely from the point of view\r\n  of an artillerist and a practical seaman, I can perceive very great\r\n  tactical advantages to be obtained by the adoption of the mode of\r\n  protection proposed as a substitute for obsolete armor, and I view\r\n  with much regret the one-sidedness of the conclusions arrived at by\r\n  the opponents of this system, and the disparaging terms in which\r\n  it is sought to turn it into ridicule, such as ‘doubtful devices’\r\n  and ‘useless contrivances,’ etc., because they indicate prejudice\r\n  and a want of mature consideration of the incidents of naval\r\n  battles. I cannot, also, help observing that while, on the one\r\n  side, prophesying the most fatal consequences to ensue from what is\r\n  called ‘stripping ships of armor,’ on the other side no admission\r\n  is made of the disastrous results which must follow from placing\r\n  reliance on such a delusive defensive agency as an armor-plate\r\n  known to be penetrable by guns certain to be encountered; and\r\n  in order to support this theory we are called upon to believe\r\n  that gunners will be so excited in action or so unskilful that\r\n  in no case will they hit the large object aimed at, namely, the\r\n  water-line of an adversary passing even at close quarters on\r\n  their beam, but I shall refer to this feature of assumed impunity\r\n  hereafter.\r\n\r\n  “Sir Edward Reed’s comparative remarks on the effect of shot-holes\r\n  as between the two systems of defence are of the same one-sided\r\n  character, notwithstanding the evidence of the fractured condition\r\n  of armor-plates subjected to experimental firing; and it is\r\n  almost apparent that in decrying the one mode of protection he\r\n  has lost sight of the fact that a ten-inch armor-plate is all\r\n  that will stand between the life and death of a ship—that is\r\n  to say, between one well-directed shell and the magazines and\r\n  boilers—which plate can be easily penetrated and smashed up by\r\n  the guns which similar vessels will assuredly carry if so invited.\r\n  Also, in referring to the baneful effects of raking fire and shell\r\n  explosion inboard, the assumed inferiority is misplaced because\r\n  one prominent advantage of the cellular-deck system is that by\r\n  economizing weight at the water-line it enables the bow and stern\r\n  to be armor-plated—a matter of the highest tactical importance\r\n  as a defence against raking fire, which is unobtainable in a\r\n  belted ship of the same displacement, at least without entailing\r\n  a considerable reduction of the thickness of armor on the belt.\r\n  This feature of end-on defence is not only an essential element of\r\n  safety, but must prove most effective as enabling a combatant to\r\n  close his adversary at an advantage, and enforce the bow-to-bow ram\r\n  encounter, or compel him to resort to a stern fight, or otherwise\r\n  to pass him at such close quarters as will insure direct hits\r\n  and depressed fire at the water-line belt, and by these tactics\r\n  the opportunities for riddling the raft body will be few and far\r\n  between.\r\n\r\n  “I may also express the opinion that for repairing damages in a\r\n  raft-bodied ship at the water-line far more efficacious means can\r\n  be resorted to than the ordinary shot-plugs, and that the use of\r\n  cork bags for closing shot-holes in the coffer-dam sides, if they\r\n  are open at the top, is far from being an unreasonable or ‘stupid\r\n  contrivance,’ as it is called, considering that, as a general\r\n  rule, the perforations through thin plating would not be ragged or\r\n  extensive. Sir Edward Reed’s wise suggestion to make the outer skin\r\n  of the coffer-dam of two-inch steel plates would render machine-gun\r\n  fire of little avail. The injurious effects of shell fire would,\r\n  I reckon, be far more fatal if the projectile exploded in passing\r\n  through the ten-inch belt than if it burst at some distance inboard\r\n  after penetrating thin plating. I think it will be admitted without\r\n  dispute that this feature of design must be governed to a great\r\n  extent by tactical considerations, the object sought for being\r\n  to secure out of a given weight of steel the greatest amount of\r\n  fighting vitality consistent with the power of manœuvring available\r\n  between skilful antagonists. This view of the case is especially\r\n  applicable to single actions at sea, when a clever tactician\r\n  will select his mode of fighting according to the offensive and\r\n  defensive properties known to be possessed by his opponent, and in\r\n  this respect an armor-plated bow and stern will afford enormous\r\n  advantages, both for attack and defence, if the plating is extended\r\n  as high as the upper deck.\r\n\r\n  “In fleet actions the ram and torpedo will require more attention\r\n  than the gun attack, and that feature of battle introduces another\r\n  disputed point, namely, the limit of size of ship; but that\r\n  question is outside the scope of the present discussion, and I\r\n  shall conclude my arguments by a strong expression of opinion that,\r\n  as gunpowder has so completely mastered the pretensions of outside\r\n  armor protection, the direction in which prudence leans towards\r\n  defensive properties in future designs for ships-of-war is that\r\n  of deflection rather than of direct resistance, and that in this\r\n  respect science has not reached its utmost limit of invention.\r\n\r\n  “The prevailing disposition to regulate the power of the gun by the\r\n  size of the vessel is, I consider, a great mistake, seeing that\r\n  the additional weight of a powerful gun is not inadmissible, even\r\n  in such vessels as our belted cruisers, and looking to the strong\r\n  inducement held out by the continued use of armor-plating, even of\r\n  such moderate thickness as ten inches. In the splendid steamers\r\n  purchased from the mercantile marine, which are being armed with\r\n  light guns only, one 25-ton gun would greatly add to their fighting\r\n  power, but the cause of this omission may probably be found in the\r\n  answer to the question, Where are the guns?”\r\n\r\nThe following reply appeared in the _Times_ (London) of May 1, 1885:\r\n\r\n  “SIR.—The letter of Admiral Sir George Elliot ... deals ably and\r\n  candidly with a subject of such fundamental importance to our navy\r\n  that I venture to offer a few observations upon it.\r\n\r\n  “I am glad to see that the gallant admiral separates his case and\r\n  the cellular or raft-deck system from any connection with the\r\n  _Collingwood_ or _Admiral_ type of ship, but I regret that he has\r\n  treated my criticisms of that kind of ship just as if I had applied\r\n  them in the abstract to the system which he advocates. This is\r\n  not fair either to the gallant officer himself or to me, as will\r\n  presently appear.\r\n\r\n  “If Sir George Elliot will remove the cellular or raft-deck\r\n  question completely away from the very unsatisfactory and\r\n  unpleasant region of Admiralty practice, and let it be treated\r\n  upon its merits, while I shall still have to respectfully submit\r\n  to him some cautionary considerations, I shall also be prepared to\r\n  make to him some very considerable concessions. One thing I should\r\n  find it desirable to press upon him is the absolute necessity of\r\n  giving closer attention to the provision of stability. He treats\r\n  the subject mainly as a question of ‘buoyancy,’ and wisely so from\r\n  his point of view; but ‘stability,’ or the power of resisting\r\n  capsizing, comes first, and on this he declines to offer an\r\n  opinion. Again, when the gallant officer speaks of a ‘raft’ deck,\r\n  I would point out that this may be a very different thing from a\r\n  cellular-deck. The characteristic of a raft is that it is usually\r\n  formed of solid buoyant materials; you may make it of cellular\r\n  steel if you please, but in that case wherever injury lets in water\r\n  the steel so far ceases to be a raft, which helps to float its\r\n  load, and becomes a weight to help sink it. Now, cells formed of\r\n  thin steel do not upon the face of the matter appear to be safe\r\n  materials for a raft which is to be subject to the multitudinous\r\n  fire of small guns and the explosions of shells of all sizes. It\r\n  needs a very skilful artificer to build a safe floating raft of\r\n  thin steel for such a purpose, especially when regard is had to the\r\n  dangers of raking fire, against which bow and stern armor would not\r\n  sufficiently provide.\r\n\r\n  “Having expressed these cautions, I will go on to say that in my\r\n  opinion the main idea of your gallant correspondent, which he\r\n  has so long and so steadily developed, is nevertheless a sound\r\n  one, and one which has a great future. I do not, of course, for a\r\n  moment admit with him that the gun has yet mastered the armor. I\r\n  believe the _Dreadnought_, though of old design, would still fight\r\n  a good action against all ships now ready for sea, and have to fear\r\n  only a very exceptional, and therefore either a very skilful or\r\n  very fortunate, shot. The recent Admiralty ships, where they are\r\n  armored, are practically proof against almost every gun afloat.\r\n  Further, I have satisfied myself that if the existing restrictions\r\n  imposed upon us by the absence of floating docks adapted to receive\r\n  ships of great breadth were removed (these restrictions crippling\r\n  us to a most unfortunate degree), and if certain professional\r\n  conventionalities as to the forms of ships were set aside, it would\r\n  be perfectly practicable to build war-ships no larger and no more\r\n  costly than the _Inflexible_, with enough side-armor more than a\r\n  yard (three feet) thick to preserve their stability, and at the\r\n  same time made ram-proof and torpedo-proof. Meanwhile, of all the\r\n  vulnerable objects afloat, the recent guns themselves, by reason of\r\n  their absurdly long and slender barrels, left fully exposed to all\r\n  fire, are among the most vulnerable.\r\n\r\n  “Still, the raft-deck system has a wide field before it, and I am\r\n  quite prepared to admit that I believe in its practicability and in\r\n  its sufficient security for certain classes of vessels if properly\r\n  carried out. This it has not yet been in any single instance. Even\r\n  in the case of the great Italian ships, as in our own, there are\r\n  elements of weakness which would be fatal to the system in action,\r\n  but which are _not_ unavoidable. Allow me to assure Sir George\r\n  Elliot that I have largely and closely studied this subject, and\r\n  that my main objections to it are not objections of principle.\r\n\r\n  “If the raft-deck system is to be adopted, it must in my opinion\r\n  be carried out in a much fuller and more satisfactory manner than\r\n  hitherto, and with the aid of arrangements which I have for a long\r\n  time past seen the necessity of, and been engaged upon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “To my mind the Admiralty, while protecting certain parts and\r\n  contents of their largest ships from injury from shell fire, have\r\n  made the fatal error of failing to protect the ship itself, which\r\n  contains them all, from being too readily deprived of stability\r\n  and made to capsize. The advocates of the alternative system must\r\n  not repeat this error, or, if they do, they must not expect me\r\n  to become their ally. On the other hand, if they will join me\r\n  in despising what are merely specious elements of safety, and\r\n  in demanding those which are real, if they will insist that our\r\n  principal and most costly ships at least shall be so constructed\r\n  as to keep afloat and upright for a reasonable length of time in\r\n  battle, in spite of any form of attack, so as to give their gallant\r\n  crews a fair chance of achieving their objects, they will not find\r\n  me averse to any improvement whatever. When a suitable opportunity\r\n  offers I shall be happy to show to Admiral Sir George Elliot\r\n  that he has not been alone in seeking to develop the cellular or\r\n  raft-deck system, and that it has, in fact, capabilities which\r\n  possibly he himself may not yet have fully realized.”\r\n\r\nThe same number of the _Times_ contains a reply to Mr. Reed’s letter\r\nof April 8, 1885, by Mr. White, mainly devoted to a refutation of\r\ncertain charges of no interest to us, but containing the following\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n  “I must refer to the passage in which Sir Edward Reed quotes a\r\n  description of the damage done to the _Huascar_ in her action with\r\n  the two Chilian iron-clads.\r\n\r\n  “This description seems to me one of the best possible\r\n  illustrations of a remark in my previous letter, that ‘the\r\n  _mitraille_ which is driven back into a ship when armor is\r\n  penetrated is probably as destructive as any kind of projectile can\r\n  be.’ Had the _Huascar_ not had weak armor, but light sides only,\r\n  the local injuries might have been less. The other case cited of\r\n  a shell which entered the unarmored stern of the _Cochrane_ shows\r\n  how little damage may be done when a projectile passes through\r\n  thin plating. At the bombardment of Alexandria there were many\r\n  such examples on board our ships, although it must be frankly\r\n  admitted that the engagement is no sufficient indication of what\r\n  shell fire may do. A good deal of use has been made of the single\r\n  case where a shell in bursting blew a hole ten by four feet in the\r\n  thin side-plating of the _Superb_. The case was quite exceptional,\r\n  whether it be compared with the other hits on the same ship or with\r\n  the injuries done to the unarmored sides of other ships. Moreover,\r\n  in that case exceptional injury is traceable to special structural\r\n  arrangements at the embrasure near the battery port, where the\r\n  shell struck. These cases do not prove that the light unarmored\r\n  structures in the _Admiral_ class are likely to be destroyed in\r\n  such a rapid and wholesale manner as has been asserted. Nor,\r\n  on the other hand, do they indicate conclusively what damage\r\n  shell-fire may do in future actions. On these points, as I have\r\n  before remarked, experiment might be made with advantage. But, on\r\n  the other hand, there is good evidence that armor so thin as to be\r\n  readily penetrable to many guns may be a serious danger, and that\r\n  armor over the vital parts of ships should be strong if it is to be\r\n  a real defence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “In matters of ship design the constructors of the navy are\r\n  only the servants of the Board, and while they must take sole\r\n  responsibility for professional work, the governing features in\r\n  the designs are determined by higher authorities, among whom are\r\n  officers of large experience, both as seamen and gunners. And it\r\n  is certainly not the practice of the constructive department to\r\n  intrude themselves or their advice into matters for which neither\r\n  their training nor their experience fits them to give an opinion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “I make no attempt to be either a sailor or a gunner, but am\r\n  content to seek information from the best authorities in both\r\n  branches. As the result of this study of tactics and gunnery, I\r\n  have been led to the belief that the sea-fights of the future are\r\n  not likely to be settled altogether or chiefly by the effects of\r\n  gun-fire. This is not quite the same thing as Sir Edward Reed\r\n  attributes to me when he says that ‘Mr. White thinks and speaks as\r\n  if naval warfare henceforth were to be merely a matter of dodging,\r\n  getting chance shots, and keeping out of an enemy’s way.’\r\n\r\n  “Nor do I think that the designers of the Italian war-ships will\r\n  indorse the description of their views and intentions, with which\r\n  Sir Edward Reed has favored us in his letter and elsewhere. I have\r\n  the honor of knowing his excellency Signor Brin (now Minister\r\n  of Marine) and other members of the constructive corps of the\r\n  Italian navy, and from their statements, including the powerful\r\n  publications of Signor Brin, ‘La Nostra Marina Militaire,’ I have\r\n  no hesitation in saying that in spending larger sums on single\r\n  ships than have ever before been spent, the Italian authorities\r\n  think, and are not alone in thinking, that they are producing the\r\n  most powerful fighting-ships afloat.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\nRANGE OF GUNS.\r\n\r\n_From Report of U.

What would such\r\npersons think of the batteries of the _Nelson_, _Northampton_, and\r\n_Shannon_, each open for more than one hundred feet in length, on\r\neach side of the ship, in so far as armor is concerned?\r\n\r\n[6] The _Italia_ and _Lepanto_, for example.\r\n\r\n[7] See Notes, page 58.\r\n\r\n[8] “The British Navy,” vol. i., p. 438.\r\n\r\n[9] _Ibid._, p. 427. The writer trusts he may be excused from again\r\nquoting these very important sentences from the work of the former\r\nSecretary to the Admiralty, notwithstanding that he recently had\r\noccasion to quote them elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[10] The reasons for placing this ship in the list of armored ships,\r\nagainst the writer’s own judgment, have been stated previously. (See\r\nNotes for new ships.)\r\n\r\n[11] Harbor-defence vessel.\r\n\r\n[12] Three turret-vessels, nearly resembling the _Gorgon_, which\r\nbelong to the Indian and colonial governments, are not included\r\nin this list, nor are several unimportant small vessels, _viz._,\r\n_Scorpion_, _Wyvern_, _Viper_, _Waterwitch_, and _Vixen_. The very\r\nfew remaining thinly armored wood-built ships are also excluded.\r\n\r\n[13] Ships for local defence of ports.\r\n\r\n[14] Cruisers for distant service.\r\n\r\n[15] The thicknesses of decks given are those of the horizontal, or\r\nnearly horizontal, parts of the deck. Where the decks slope down at\r\nthe sides the thickness is sometimes increased a little, as will have\r\nbeen seen in the section of the _Mersey_. (See Notes for new ships.)\r\n\r\n[16] See Notes, page 60.\r\n\r\n[17] The editor of these Notes wishes to acknowledge his very great\r\nindebtedness to the Office of United States Naval Intelligence\r\nfor the data relating to foreign navies, notably to Lieutenant R.\r\nP. Rodgers, Chief Intelligence Officer, and to Lieutenants W. H.\r\nBeehler, J. C. Colwell, and W. I. Chambers, Assistants. The notes\r\nupon the United States Navy are to a great degree reprints of his\r\nown contributions to the editorial and news columns of the New York\r\n_Herald_.\r\n\r\n[18] “Recent Naval Progress,” June, 1887.\r\n\r\n[19] Lieutenant Colwell, U.S.N., in “Recent Naval Progress,” 1887.\r\n\r\n[20] Lieutenant Chambers, U.S.N.\r\n\r\n[21] “Our War Ships,” Cusack-Smith.\r\n\r\n[22] It is called a belt in _Lloyd’s Universal Register_, but the\r\nterm is very likely to mislead.—E. J. R.\r\n\r\n[23] It will be instructive to repeat here, before leaving this\r\nquestion of partially armored ships, a comparison resembling that\r\nwhich I employed in a paper read at the Royal United Service\r\nInstitution, in which are set down in one column the displacements of\r\ncertain British and French ships, eleven of each, built and building,\r\npossessing maximum armor on the water-line of at least fifteen\r\ninches. As all the French ships given have complete or all but\r\ncomplete armor-belts, it is proper to reckon their whole displacement\r\ntonnages as armored tonnage. But in the case of all the British ships\r\nwhich carry such thick armor they are deprived of armor altogether\r\nexcept amidships, and it is therefore misleading, and even absurd,\r\nto reckon their whole displacement tonnages as armored tonnage. For\r\nthis reason I am obliged to give two tonnages for them, _viz._, the\r\narmored and the unarmored, as I do below:\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------++----------------------------------------+\r\n  |   FRENCH SHIPS.         ||        BRITISH SHIPS.                  |\r\n  +----------------+--------++-------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |                |Armored.||            Unarmored.|Armored.| Total. |\r\n  +----------------+--------++-------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |                | Tons.  ||             |  Tons. |  Tons. |  Tons. |\r\n  | Amiral Baudin  | 11,141 || Inflexible  |  5,210 |  6,670 | 11,880 |\r\n  | Amiral Duperré | 10,486 || Ajax        |  4,160 |  4,350 |  8,510 |\r\n  | Dévastation    |  9,639 || Agamemnon   |  4,160 |  4,350 |  8,510 |\r\n  | Formidable     | 11,441 || Colossus    |  4,580 |  4,570 |  9,150 |\r\n  | Courbet        |  9,639 || Edinburgh   |  4,580 |  4,570 |  9,150 |\r\n  | Hoche          |  9,864 || Collingwood |  4,580 |  4,570 |  9,150 |\r\n  | Magenta        |  9,864 || Rodney      |  4,800 |  4,900 |  9,700 |\r\n  | Marceau        |  9,864 || Home        |  4,800 |  4,900 |  9,700 |\r\n  | Neptune        |  9,864 || Camperdown  |  4,900 |  5,100 | 10,000 |\r\n  | Caïman         |  7,239 || Benbow      |  4,900 |  5,100 | 10,000 |\r\n  | Indomptable    |  7,184 || Anson       |  4,900 |  5,100 | 10,000 |\r\n  +----------------+--------++-------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |     Total      |106,225 ||   Total     | 51,570 | 54,180 |105,750 |\r\n  +----------------+--------++-------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nI have not thought it necessary to alter these figures in repeating\r\nthis comparison, as they are sufficiently near the truth for the only\r\npurpose for which I employ them, which is that of exhibiting the fact\r\nthat whereas the above eleven British iron-clads (so called) figure\r\nin the official tables of the British government as constituting an\r\narmored tonnage of 105,750 tons, nearly equal to that of the eleven\r\nFrench ships, they really represent but little more than half that\r\namount of armored tonnage.—E. J. R.\r\n\r\n[24] For the reason before stated, the _Brennus_ and _Charles Martel_\r\nare omitted from this table.\r\n\r\n[25] These powers and speeds are taken from _Lloyd’s Universal\r\nRegister_.\r\n\r\n[26] Some returns say four of 28 tons, and four of 24 tons, all being\r\nof 27 centimetres calibre. I have adopted these in Table A.\r\n\r\n[27] See Notes, page 263.\r\n\r\n[28] Lieutenant Chambers, U. S. Navy.\r\n\r\n[29] Lieutenant Colwell, U. S. Navy.\r\n\r\n[30] Lieutenant Shroeder, U. S. Navy.\r\n\r\n[31] I adopt this figure from Lord Brassey, who adopts it from Mr.\r\nKing, but I am inclined to regard it as too small by about five feet,\r\nfor I observe that in giving the length as 107 feet they give the\r\nbreadth as 58 feet, whereas they give the breadth of the ship as 64¾\r\nfeet. I also observe that they both speak of an “armored citadel or\r\ncompartment 107 feet in length,” and the word “compartment” seems to\r\npoint to _inside_ dimensions, and although it seems odd to use these\r\nin such a case, it is probable that that has been done. But as there\r\nis considerable curvature in the transverse bulkheads, and as the\r\ngreatest inside length has presumably been given, it may still be\r\npractically correct to regard the mean length of the battery as 107\r\nfeet. I regret that I have not the means at hand of making certain of\r\nthe precise length.—E. J. R.\r\n\r\n[32] See Notes, page 136.\r\n\r\n[33] _Lloyd’s Universal Register_ falls into a still more notable\r\nerror in respect to the speed of these vessels, for it assigns to the\r\nbest of them a speed of only seven and one-half knots, and to some\r\nonly five knots, whereas they are very much faster, as will presently\r\nbe shown in the text. But the mistake, grave as it is, seems to me\r\nto have resulted only from a printer’s error, for the removal of a\r\nvertical “lead” one column to the left would add ten knots to the\r\nspeeds of all these vessels, and make them correct.—E. J. R.\r\n\r\n[34] See Notes, page 139.\r\n\r\n[35] According to the _Universal Register_; but only two of nine\r\ntons (besides smaller ones) according to Admiralty Return to\r\nParliament.—E. J. R.\r\n\r\n[36] The _Grosser Kurfürst_ was run into off Folkestone by the _König\r\nWilhelm_, and foundered.—E. J. R.\r\n\r\n[37] See Notes, page 145.\r\n\r\n[38] _Lloyd’s Universal Register_ appears to me to be in error\r\nconcerning the speed of this and the next vessel. The _Carnet_ gives\r\ntheir speed as fourteen knots, and the Admiralty Return puts it at\r\nfifteen knots, which I believe to be the expected speed.—E. J. R.\r\n\r\n[39] See Notes, page 145.\r\n\r\n[40] See Notes, page 144.\r\n\r\n[41] See Notes, page 144.\r\n\r\n[42] Curiously enough, neither Lord Brassey, nor Mr. King (United\r\nStates Navy), nor Captain Von Kronenfels seems to have been aware\r\nof the origin of this little ship’s design, for it is mentioned\r\nby none of them, although all of them have been most ready to\r\ndo me, in common with others, full justice in such matters. Mr.\r\nKing, for example, speaking of a ship previously mentioned, says,\r\n“The most powerful ship belonging to the Turkish navy is the\r\n_Mesoodiyeh_, designed by Sir E. J. Reed, C.B., M.P., built by the\r\nThames Shipbuilding Company, delivered to the Sultan in 1876, and\r\nnow the flag-ship of the fleet.” He would doubtless have as readily\r\nacknowledged the authorship of the _Feth-i-Bulend’s_ design, had he\r\nbeen aware of it. As I was the Chief Constructor of the British Navy\r\nwhen I designed for the Sultan of Turkey this ship and the _Fatikh_\r\n(now the German _König Wilhelm_), I think it right to state that I\r\ndid so not only with the sanction but by the orders of the Admiralty,\r\nand in pursuance of what was then the declared policy of England,\r\nviz., that of giving Turkey the benefit of our good offices in\r\nefforts to produce a powerful fleet. Beyond a complimentary present\r\nof a jewelled snuffbox or two, I received no remuneration for my\r\nservices to Turkey, and sought none, and desired none.—E. J.
