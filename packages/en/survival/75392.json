Some authorities,\r\nas we shall see later, are fully convinced that the radiations can\r\nbe employed successfully in the prolongation of human life. It is\r\nwell known that radiotherapy has, for some years now, been employed\r\nadvantageously in the treatment of many forms of illness, and is, in\r\nsome institutions, the sole medium for the cure or alleviation of\r\ncancer and other malignant growths.\r\n\r\nNot long ago the discovery was made that the curative agent in certain\r\nfamous baths in Europe is the radium which the waters of their springs\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nIf one could really buy bottled water which has been properly treated\r\nwith radium rays or the “emanation,” beneficial results would no doubt\r\nbe obtained. The trouble is that such waters are difficult to secure.\r\n\r\n“None of the foreign or domestic commercial bottled water sold\r\nto consumers on the claim of radioactive content really contains\r\nsufficient radioactivity to warrant its purchase,” according to the\r\nreport of investigation completed by the water and beverage laboratory\r\nof the United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n“In the examination of 46 samples from 15 states and eight foreign\r\ncountries, the bureau found the highest quantity of radioactivity of a\r\ntemporary nature in a bottled water from Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n“The largest amount of permanent radioactivity was in a sample from a\r\ndeep well in Ohio. It was found, however, that it would be necessary to\r\nconsume 2,810 gallons of the Massachusetts water, or 1,957 gallons of\r\nthe Ohio water daily to obtain an efficient dose of radioactive salts.\r\n\r\n“During the tests radioactivity of samples was determined by means of\r\nelectroscopes.”\r\n\r\nWhen radium is taken in soluble form, 25 or 50 percent of it remains\r\nin the body for four or five days. The rate of excretion after that is\r\nonly about one percent a day. “Wherever it is located, it carries on a\r\nconstant bombardment in releasing its energy, giving strength to the\r\ntissues, cells and protoplasm of the body. And when once these begin\r\nto function actively, they begin to rebuild themselves.”\r\n\r\nRadium does not combine chemically with any known substance in the\r\nbody. The therapeutic effects are indirect. When the electrons are\r\nejected with great speed from the atoms of the radioactive salts, they\r\npass through millions of other atoms, knocking out new electrons as\r\nthey go, leaving the atoms with a positive charge, in which condition\r\nthey are called “ions.” These positively charged particles at once\r\nenter into new combinations, new chemical unions, which produce new\r\nsubstances. But these may be injurious to the normal tissues as well\r\nas to the cells of the disease which it is desired to destroy. In some\r\ncases, the diseased cells are more susceptible to the rays than are the\r\nnormal cells, in which instances the growth of the abnormal or diseased\r\ncells may be retarded, or they may even be totally destroyed. It is\r\nthus seen that application of the rays may result in alleviation of the\r\ndisease, or, possibly, effect a complete cure, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe action of radium on various (colloidal) substances is now well\r\nunderstood from the point of view of the biophysicist; but this phase\r\nof the subject is too highly technical for exposition in a book\r\nintended for popular circulation.\r\n\r\nWhile it is fully recognized that there are quite definite limitations\r\nto the efficacy of radioactivity in its application to disease, as a\r\nmatter of fact the use of radium as a therapeutic agent would be much\r\nmore extensive were it not for its high cost and scarcity. No one\r\nquestions its exceptional value in the treatment of certain diseases,\r\nand a method will probably be discovered, in the near future, by which\r\nit may veritably be used to postpone the age of senility.\r\n\r\nA young man who had read somewhere that radium is a sure cure for any\r\nand all of the ills to which flesh is heir, entered a drug store and\r\nasked: “How much is radium an ounce?” The druggist smiled, and named\r\na figure which made the young man blink. “Not really?” observed the\r\nprospective customer. “Then you may give me an ounce of cough lozenges.”\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently, an ounce of radium cost almost as much as 3¾ tons\r\nof gold! That is to say, an ounce of radium, if this much could be\r\npurchased “off hand”--which it couldn’t--would cost about $2,500,000.\r\nThe price was at one time $3,000,000 an ounce.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of “radium,” we really mean--or ought to mean--_radium\r\nsalts_. Pure radium soon abandons its metallic form by entering into\r\nchemical combinations. It is the purified radium salts that cost, as\r\nlate as 1923, $2,500,000 an ounce--the price of ¾ of a ton of platinum,\r\nthe most “precious” of all the metals excepting radium. In 1920, radium\r\nwas 200 times more valuable than an equal weight of pure blue diamonds,\r\nand 180,600 times as valuable as gold. A cubic foot of the salts--had\r\nthis amount been obtainable--would have been worth $7,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the high cost of radium is not far to seek. First, the\r\ndemand for the pure salts far exceeded the supply--and this is still\r\nthe case, though relief is now in sight. Secondly, the scarcity of\r\nradium was due to the enormous amount of time and labor involved in its\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nAlthough radium was discovered and isolated by Mme. Curie in 1898,\r\n22 years later--at the close of 1920--scarcely 140 grams (or about\r\nfive ounces) of pure radium salts had been extracted and put on the\r\nworld market. Of this amount, about 70 grams had been produced in the\r\nUnited States (during the preceding seven years). The market value of\r\nthe standard salts was at this time about $100,000 a gram (about 1/28\r\nounce). Eighteen grams were produced in this country in 1920, and the\r\nvalue of the purified salts was quoted in some journals as $2,160,000.\r\nAt this price, about $100,000 worth of radium could be put into a glass\r\ntube about the diameter of a very coarse pencil lead and not more than\r\nan inch in length.\r\n\r\nTo produce the gram of radium salts presented to Mme. Curie by the\r\nwomen of America (in May, 1921), 500 tons of carnotite ore--containing\r\ntwo percent or less of uranium oxide--were treated, consuming in the\r\nprocess 1,500 tons of coal, more than a ton of chemicals, and over 30\r\ntons of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL MATTER RADIOACTIVE\r\n\r\nWhile certain substances have been designated as “radioactive,” it is\r\nnot to be understood that these bodies alone emit charged particles, or\r\nradiant energy.\r\n\r\n“All bodies whatever are a constant source of visible or invisible\r\nradiations, which, whether of one kind or the other, are always\r\nradiations of light” (Le Bon, “The Evolution of Forces,” p. 318, 1908).\r\n\r\nCompounds of potassium, and also of rubidium, caesium and lanthanum, as\r\nshown by Campbell, Wood, McLennan, Kennedy, and other investigators,\r\npossess very high radioactive properties. While the atomic weight of\r\npotassium is only about 39, and of rubidium about 84, the typical\r\nradioactive elements have atomic weights ranging from 200 to 238. Of\r\nthe 12 to 15 elements essential to life, potassium is the only one\r\npossessing distinct if minute radioactivity. “The activity of potassium\r\nmay readily be demonstrated by means of the goldleaf electroscope. It\r\nis shown that Beta rays are emitted” (Burns). But potassium is 1000\r\ntimes weaker than uranium, and 1,000,000,000 times weaker than radium,\r\nin the emission of Beta (negative) rays. Caesium and lanthanum emit\r\nAlpha (positive) rays.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dufour, the distinguished French scientist, has shown that\r\neven air that has been breathed emits radioactive particles. The\r\npresence of radioactive matter in the atmosphere has been shown to\r\naccount for its electric conductivity. Thomson found (1906) that many\r\nspecimens of water from deep wells contain a radioactive gas, and\r\nElster and Gertel have found that a similar gas is contained in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nIt is probably safe to assert, with Le Bon, that all matter, “down to\r\nthe absolute zero of temperature,” radiates electrified and more or\r\nless luminous particles, albeit they are invisible to the human eye.\r\n\r\nIt is because of its property of emitting negative electrons (Beta\r\nrays) that potassium is a necessary constituent of all living matter.\r\nIt may, however, be replaced, under certain conditions, by other\r\nradioactive substances.\r\n\r\nProf. Barton Scammel, of the British Radium Society, gave it as his\r\nopinion (in 1922) that further experience in the proper uses of\r\npotassium salts and radium in solution would lead to the realization of\r\na new golden age. He predicted, among other “good tidings,” life for\r\n120 years in the bloom of youth, the “pep” of 25 years at 75, a third\r\nset of teeth, new hirsute coverings for erstwhile bald heads, muscles\r\nlike Jack Dempsey’s.\r\n\r\nDr. C. Everett Field, of the New York Radium Institute, stated\r\npublicly, in backing up Scammel’s hopes and theories, that he thinks\r\nanother ten years will see human life vastly prolonged as a matter of\r\ncourse by the use of radium. He said:\r\n\r\n“We have ascertained beyond question that potassium salts are necessary\r\nto heart action, that they are slightly radioactive, and that radium\r\ncan be substituted for them with a degree of success.\r\n\r\n“It was Dr. Zwaardemaker, physiologist of the University of Utrecht,\r\nwho first discovered, a number of years ago, that radium could do in\r\nthe blood stream what potassium salts do in the normal person. He took\r\nan animal’s heart, which was kept beating outside the animal, and\r\nremoved the potassium element. It was not longer possible then to keep\r\nit in action. Then he substituted a radium solution and it was possible\r\nto restore action.”\r\n\r\nDr. Field stated that it had been discovered that the systems of\r\nvictims of cancer and other wasting diseases were deficient in\r\npotassium salts, and that as their systems were made to assimilate\r\npotassium a tonic effect was noticeable at once. The greatest trouble\r\nwas to make the body assimilate the potassium.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Dr. Field, one of the more conservative radium\r\ntherapists, “that radium does not do the healing. But, for that matter,\r\nneither does any other form of healing. The healing exists within\r\nthe organism. And radium, I am convinced, in some cases, is the most\r\nefficient medicine to give needed stimulus to the healing apparatus of\r\ndiseased organisms.”\r\n\r\nEven now, he believes, radioactive treatment may prolong life at least\r\n15 years. For internal treatment, either doses of radioactive water,\r\nor extremely minute quantities of radium itself, are administered.\r\nRadioactive water is taken from springs found to contain traces of\r\nradium, or radium is used to make ordinary water radioactive. The\r\ndifficulty with spring waters is that they lose their radioactive power\r\nwhen bottled and transported, and must be consumed at their source.\r\n\r\n“Because of this fact,” says a writer for _The Popular Science Monthly_\r\n(June, 1923), “a group of physicians interested in the use of radium as\r\na curative stimulant have invented an ingenious device for imparting\r\nradioactive properties to ordinary water. As designed for use in the\r\nhome, this instrument consists of a case containing an arrangement\r\nof glass tubes and vessels in which emanations from radium salts in\r\nsolution are imparted to air, which is then mixed with the water.\r\n\r\n“A much simpler apparatus, available for office use, somewhat resembles\r\na hypodermic syringe, containing special capsules of radium salts.\r\nPushing a plunger forces air through the radium capsules and into a\r\nglass of water and is said to make the water radioactive. The doses of\r\nradium in each case are constant, because radium emanates at a constant\r\nrate, and only a certain amount can be dissolved in water, no matter\r\nhow many times a day the apparatus is brought into use.\r\n\r\n“Whether radium treatment will prove able to restore youth to old age,\r\ngrow new sets of teeth and perform other marvels that its more ardent\r\nsupporters predict for it, only time will tell.\r\n\r\n“If radium treatment proves to facilitate the process of cell\r\nelimination, it will have gone a long way toward delivering the world\r\nfrom its enemies of disease.”\r\n\r\nThe philosopher-scientist, Le Bon, makes bold to suggest that\r\nlight-waves which are invisible to human eyes may be perceptible to\r\nnocturnal animals, which would include most of the lemurs and the\r\nfelines, and some other beasts which seem to be capable of finding\r\ntheir way and carrying on their predatory or other activities in the\r\ndark. “To them,” says Le Bon, “the body of a living being, whose\r\ntemperature is about 37° C., or about 98° F., ought to be surrounded\r\nby a luminous halo, which the want of sensitiveness of our eyes alone\r\nprevents our discovering. There do not exist in nature, in reality, any\r\ndark bodies, but only imperfect eyes.”\r\n\r\nLe Bon has also said that the human body is sufficiently radioactive\r\nto photograph itself by its own rays, if we could find a substance\r\nsensitive to these radiations, as the photographic plate is to the\r\nactinic rays. Nothing would then be easier, he declares, than to\r\nphotograph a living body in the dark without any other source of light\r\nthan the invisible light which it is continually emitting.\r\n\r\nSome recent (1924) experiments of the French scientist, Dr. Albert\r\nNodon, seem to afford the actual proof of Le Bon’s _a priori_\r\nconclusions. In the presence of a number of noted scientists, Dr. Nodon\r\nexhibited three photographic plates on which were unmistakable light\r\nimpressions, which, he claimed, were caused by the rays emitted by a\r\nradioactive mineral, an insect, and a green leaf, which had been placed\r\non the emulsion side of the plates in a dark-room.\r\n\r\nA similar experiment, in which a dead insect and a dead leaf were used,\r\nresulted in no ray impressions on the plates. Dr. Nodon offered as his\r\nconclusion that radioactivity is an inevitable accompaniment of living\r\nprocesses, and stated that the strength of photographic impressions\r\nproduced in experiments such as his are an accurate measure of vitality\r\n(see _Popular Science Monthly_, October, 1924).\r\n\r\nRadium is probably present in all the planets and stars. Some time ago\r\nthe Astronomer Royal of England, Dr. F. W. Dyson, demonstrated the\r\nexistence of radium and of radium emanation in the sun’s chromosphere\r\n(the ocean of incandescent hydrogen gas surrounding the photosphere, or\r\nactual surface of the sun).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEVERYDAY USES OF RADIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the World War large quantities of radium were employed by the\r\nAllies for night compasses, luminous dials on airplanes, gun-sights,\r\netc. In times of peace it is used on pendants for locating electric\r\nlights and switches in the dark, key-holes, fire-extinguishers, poison\r\nbottles, emergency call-bells, and in many other ways. For example,\r\nsome mining corporations use signs in their mines made luminous in the\r\ndark by phosphorescent paint made from radioactive substances. These\r\nluminous signs are not affected by atmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\nYet for all these uses, including “radium watches” and clocks, not more\r\nthan half an ounce of radium has been used since its discovery in 1898.\r\nA few millionth parts of a gram of radium, in the form of radioactive\r\nbarium sulphate, a large portion of phosphorescent zinc sulphide\r\n(crystallized zinc), mixed with varnish and some adhesive substance,\r\ngive enough material to illuminate 40 or 50 watches. One gram of\r\nradium (= 16 grains) combined with 20,000 grams of secret process\r\nphosphorescent zinc sulphide is sufficient to make 667,000 watches\r\nluminous for many years. The factories of this country are now turning\r\nout about four million radium watches annually.\r\n\r\nUnless a special preparation--known only to the manufacturer--is\r\nused, the luminosity of the material gradually disappears, owing to\r\nthe destruction of the zinc sulphide crystals by the powerful rays\r\nconstantly bombarding them, producing flashes at the rate of 200,000\r\na second. The radium itself does not glow, nor does it deteriorate in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIf we examine a luminous dial through a magnifying glass, after the\r\neyes have been in total darkness for a few minutes, tiny flashes of\r\nlight may be seen. These are caused by the explosion of hundreds of\r\nmillions of radium atoms. The more radium there is in the paint, the\r\ngreater the number of flashes per second, and the more durable the\r\nluminosity. Since every flash means a blow upon a crystal of zinc\r\nsulphide, the crystals gradually break under the strain. In this\r\nprocess helium is released from the disintegrating radium atoms.\r\n\r\nMr. M. A. Henry (_Scientific American_, April 2, 1921) points out that\r\nthe problem of the chemist “is to produce a phophorescent substance\r\nwhich will stand up longest under the terrific bombardment of the\r\nradium rays and which, at the same time, will give off the most light.\r\nSuch progress is being made in this direction that today [1921] only\r\nabout one-twentieth the amount of radium used four years ago [1917] is\r\nneeded in the making of luminous material. And the chemist insists that\r\nhe has only scratched the surface of possibilities in this direction\r\nand that even better results can be attained. At present the life of\r\nthe zinc crystals is from 15 to 20 years, although the radium lasts for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n“This life will be much longer if the instrument to which it is applied\r\nis kept away from the light most of the time. The crystals, already\r\nstressed by the radium rays, have an additional strain imposed by the\r\nlight and this hastens the process of disintegration. Strong sunlight,\r\nespecially at the seashore where the presence of much ozone in the air\r\nintensifies the ultra-violet rays, has a very destructive effect on\r\nluminous material. For this reason the manufacturers of this delicate\r\nsubstance usually guarantee it for about half its normal life, or ten\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\nA radium-lighted fish-bait is now on the market, and fishermen say that\r\nthis bait is very successful in attracting fish which haunt deep water.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIUM MAKES GEMS BLUSH\r\n\r\nD. Berthelot, F. Bordes, C. Doelter, and others observed that the rays\r\nfrom radium induced important changes in the colors of minerals.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Squance, of Sunderland, England, succeeded in transforming a\r\nsapphire of faint pink hue into a gorgeous ruby color, and a faint\r\ngreen sapphire into an oriental emerald hue. It was already known that\r\na diamond exposed to the rays of radium glows with a beautiful green\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn experiments carried out at the United States Bureau of Mines (1921),\r\nin Reno, Nevada, a colorless Colorado topaz was tinted yellow by\r\nexposure to penetrating radiation. If a method can be devised to make\r\nthe color permanent, the discovery will greatly increase the value of\r\nthe gem-stone material found in the west.\r\n\r\nIf we submit yellow phosphorous to the action of radioactive\r\nsubstances, it becomes changed into the red “alotropic” variety.\r\nCertain of the rays decompose ammonia, and water under their influence\r\nis subjected to electrolysis, yielding oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RADIUM CLOCK\r\n\r\nA very interesting instrument was devised by Sir William Strutt (now\r\nLord Rayleigh) which has been called a “radium clock.” It consists of\r\na glass vessel containing a tube of radium salts in the center, from\r\nwhich two gold leaves are hung. The inner surface of the containing\r\nvessel is coated with tinfoil, and this foil is grounded. The radium\r\nsalts cause the leaves to become electrically charged. They then\r\ndiverge, and, coming in contact with the grounded tinfoil coating, they\r\nare discharged, only to fall back again and repeat the process. This\r\nclock will operate as long as the supply of radioactive material will\r\nact, which in the case of pure radium would be nearly 2000 years.\r\n\r\nG. Lentner has recently succeeded in utilizing atmospheric potential by\r\nthe aid of radioactive substances, which, in some way not yet clearly\r\nunderstood, exert an influence upon the transformer. The method is\r\nas follows: A post about 12 m. in height, forming a sort of antenna,\r\nis erected; the post ends in a collector consisting of an aluminum\r\nsphere provided with points covered with radioactive substances.\r\nThis collector communicates by a conducting wire with a special\r\ntransformer. Under these conditions the earth and atmospheric currents\r\nattract each other through reciprocal induction.\r\n\r\nDr. S. A. Sochocky, the well known radium expert, has made radium\r\noil paints, and made paintings with them. “Pictures painted with\r\nradium look like any other pictures in the daytime, but at night they\r\nilluminate themselves and create an interesting and weirdly artistic\r\neffect. This paint would be particularly adaptable for pictures of\r\nmoonlight or winter scenes, and I have no doubt that some day a fine\r\nartist will make a name for himself and greatly interest us by painting\r\npictures which will be unique, and particularly beautiful at night in a\r\ndark or semi-darkened room.”\r\n\r\nDr. Sochocky also predicts that “the time will doubtless come when\r\nyou will have in your own home (or someone you know will have) a room\r\nlighted entirely by radium. It would be possible today to illuminate\r\na room, so that at night, without the aid of electricity or other\r\nartificial illumination, you could read fine newspaper print without\r\ndifficulty. The light in such a room, thrown off by radium paint on\r\nwalls and ceiling, would in color and tone be like soft moonlight,\r\nblue with a tint of yellow. Today, a room ten by nine feet could be\r\nilluminated in this way at a cost of $400, and the illumination would\r\nlast ten years.\r\n\r\n“However, such illumination will soon be much cheaper, because of new\r\ndiscoveries as to the best materials to combine with radium to produce\r\nlight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRADIUM AND THE AGE OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the important consequences of the discovery of radioactivity was\r\nto afford the scientist a means for solving the problem of the earth’s\r\nage. By “age of the earth” we mean here the time which has elapsed\r\nsince the earth’s surface became fitted for the habitation of living\r\nbeings. By means of radioactivity we can form an approximate estimate\r\nof the time which has passed since the formation of any given series of\r\ngeological strata. Radium is our geological time clock.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that all the common rocks and soils of which the\r\nearth’s crust is built up contain measurable amounts of radium.\r\nAccording to the computation made by Prof. John Joly, the total\r\nquantity of radioactive matter may be as much as one 500 billionth part\r\nof the whole volume of the globe, or something over half a cubic mile.\r\n\r\nAll of the 36 known radio-elements are disintegration products of the\r\nprimary radio-elements uranium and thorium--_i.e._, they are produced\r\nfrom one or the other of these in their long sequence of changes. And\r\nthe rate at which the radioactive products change--their average life\r\nperiod,--from the first transmutation to the final product, radium\r\nlead, an isotrope of common lead, is accurately known. (Helium atoms\r\nare “the debris shed at the various stages of the transformation.”)\r\n\r\nIt is now well established that a gram of uranium as found along with\r\nits products in rocks and minerals is changing at a rate represented by\r\nthe production of 1.88 x 10^{-11} grams of helium and 1.22 x 10^{-10}\r\ngrams of lead (isotrope) _per annum_. We do not know for a certainty,\r\nof course, that this rate of production has been maintained throughout\r\ngeological time. In the opinion of Lord Rayleigh, we may safely assume\r\nthat the rate of transformation has not changed, so that “it would seem\r\nthat in the disintegration of a gram of uranium we have a process the\r\nrate of which can be relied upon to have been the same in the past as\r\nwe now observe it to be” (_Nature_, October 27, 1921).\r\n\r\nActing on Rutherford’s suggestion, the Hon. R. J. Strutt (later\r\nLord Rayleigh) made a determination of the amount of radium in the\r\nsuperficial parts of the earth--which are alone accessible; and he\r\nalso determined the ratio of the lead (isotope) to the uranium, which\r\nwas found to be 1.3 (specifically, in the broggerite found in the\r\nPre-Cambrian rocks at Moss, Norway). Now, if we assume--as the evidence\r\nseems to warrant--that the lead of this atomic weight (206.06) was\r\nall produced by uranium at the rate given above, we get an age of 925\r\nmillion years for these rocks. Some minerals from other Archaean rocks\r\nin Norway give a rather larger figure.\r\n\r\n“In other cases,” says Lord Rayleigh, “there is some complication,\r\nowing to the fact that thorium is associated with uranium in the\r\nmineral and that it, too, produces helium and an isotrope of lead of\r\natomic weight probably 208 exactly, about one unit higher than common\r\nlead.”\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Rutherford estimated the time required for the accumulation\r\nof the radium content of a uranium mineral in the Glastonbury granitic\r\ngneiss of the early Cambrian as no less than 500,000,000 years. Later\r\ninvestigations give some of the Pre-Cambrian rocks an antiquity of\r\n1,640 millions of years! The zoologist may now have all the time he\r\nwants for the slowly evolving organisms revealed by the sedimentary\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nProf. John W. Gruner, of the geology department of the University\r\nof Minnesota, discovered (in 1925) microscopic forms of plant life\r\n(algae) embedded in iron formations of the Vermillion Range near Lake\r\nArmstrong, Minnesota. Most of Minnesota’s iron deposits are due to the\r\nalgae, Dr. Gruner thinks. The growth has the property of extracting\r\niron from sea water and making of it a solid shell with which to\r\nsurround itself. Accumulations of these iron shells through millions of\r\nyears have been embedded in rock formations forming the iron ore.\r\n\r\nSlices of rock a thousandth of an inch thick were examined under\r\nmicroscopes in the search for the algae. Algae began to flourish\r\nimmediately after the earth, in cooling (according to one cosmological\r\ntheory), got below the boiling point. Their form is much like seaweed,\r\nand they thrive at a temperature of 95° C. Dr. Gruner estimates the\r\nage of these algae-bearing deposits at 200,000,000 years, ten million\r\nyears earlier than previous evidence showed.\r\n\r\nIf we employ the radioactivity test as a measure of geological\r\ntime, the age of these fossil algae would have to be placed much\r\nhigher--older by hundreds of millions of years. And the same must be\r\nsaid of the amphibian footprints recently (1925) discovered in the\r\nsandstone slabs of the Grand Canyon, by the caretaker on Hermit’s\r\nTrail, a thousand feet below the rim of the canyon. On the older\r\ngeological time scale, these deposits date back some 50,000,000 years\r\n(lower Carboniferous period--the so-called “Mississippian” system). On\r\nthe radium time schedule, these figures would need to be multiplied\r\nconsiderably (according to Boltwood and Holmes, by a multiple of six or\r\nmore). It should be said, however, that on the time deposits of Walcott\r\nand Schuchert, based on the rate of deposition of sediments, the\r\nlower Carboniferous (Mississippian) deposits are not older than some\r\n18,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nBut amphibian footprints are known from the far older Devonian period,\r\nwhose strata are, on the radium basis, some 370 million years old.\r\n\r\nProf. Charles Schuchert, of Yale, regards the estimates of geological\r\ntime based upon the rate of disintegration of radioactive minerals as,\r\non the whole, far more reliable than estimates based upon the rate of\r\ndeposition of sediments. No scientist pretends to be able to state\r\nexactly the age of strata by the amount of radium lead contained in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“In a third class of cases,” Lord Rayleigh points out, “the uranium\r\nmineral, pitchblende, occurs in a metalliferous vein, and the lead\r\nisotope produced in the mineral is diluted with common lead which\r\nentered into its original composition, ... but the complications\r\ncannot, I think, be considered to modify the broad result.\r\n\r\n“A determination of the amount of helium in minerals gives an\r\nalternative method of estimating geological age; but helium, unlike\r\nlead, is liable to leak away, hence the estimate gives a minimum only.\r\nI have found in this way ages which, speaking generally, are about\r\none-third of the values which estimates of lead have given, and are,\r\ntherefore, generally confirmatory, having regard to leakage of helium.”\r\n\r\nDr. Homer P. Little, of the National Research Council, Washington,\r\nD. C., tells us (_Scientific American Monthly_, August, 1921, p. 173)\r\nthat “from both calculation and experiment it is found that one gram\r\nof uranium will produce helium at the rate of one cubic centimeter in\r\n9,600,000 years. The ratio between the amount of radium in a mineral\r\nand the amount of helium present therefore allows us to calculate the\r\nage of the mineral. The amount of uranium originally present compared\r\nto that left does not enter into the problem unless extreme lengths of\r\ntime are under consideration, because of the fact that it is calculated\r\nto take 5,000 million years for one-half a given volume of uranium to\r\ndisintegrate.\r\n\r\n“It is perfectly true that much of the helium generated may escape. The\r\nassumption is, however, that in some minerals comparatively little\r\nescapes: zircon, particularly, seems to be an effective retainer.\r\nThis mineral shows very effectively the increasing ratio of helium\r\nto uranium as consecutively older rocks are examined. Recent or\r\nPleistocene specimens from Vesuvius show an apparent age of 1 million\r\nyears; Miocene specimens from the Auvergne, France, of 6.3 million. The\r\nDevonian of Norway furnishes specimens 54 million years in age, and the\r\nUpper Cambrian of Colorado specimens of 141 million years; the Archaean\r\nof Ceylon, of the diamond-bearing rocks of South Africa, and of certain\r\nrocks of Ontario furnish specimens aged 286, 321 and 715 million years,\r\nrespectively.”\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the mean of the results of Professors\r\nBoltwood and Holmes’ careful studies, based upon the accumulation of\r\nlead as a final product of the uranium series:\r\n\r\n                                  MILLIONS OF\r\n                                     YEARS\r\n  Carboniferous                       340\r\n  Devonian                            370\r\n  Pre-Carboniferous                   410\r\n  Silurian or Ordovician              430\r\n  Pre-Cambrian:\r\n    Sweden                          1,025\r\n    United States of America    1,310–1,435\r\n    Ceylon                          1,640\r\n\r\nThese results, a total of 1,400,000,000 years, greatly transcend Lord\r\nRayleigh’s (Strutt’s) earlier calculations regarding the antiquity they\r\nassign to Paleozoic and Pre-Cambrian times.\r\n\r\nIn 1918, Prof. Joseph Barrell reviewed the various methods employed\r\nand the results obtained in the attempt to determine from geological,\r\nchemical and physical evidences the time that has elapsed since the\r\nbeginning of the Cambrian Period (when abundant fossil invertebrates\r\nare first met with), and reached the following time estimates for\r\nthe principal divisions of the geologic record (exclusive of the\r\nPre-Cambrian rocks):\r\n\r\n  Cenozoic time,   55,000,000 to  65,000,000 years long\r\n  Mesozoic time,  135,000,000 to 180,000,000 years long\r\n  Paleozoic time, 360,000,000 to 540,000,000 years long\r\n\r\nThe time thus established covers a period of from 550,000,000 to\r\n700,000,000 years, or from ten to 15 times longer than has usually been\r\naccepted by geologists. Pre-Cambrian time was found to have a similar\r\norder of magnitude; but here the evidence rests largely upon the\r\nradioactivity of the crystalline rocks formed during this vast period.\r\n\r\nIt is now universally accepted that the time required for the formation\r\nof the Pre-Cambrian rocks was fully as long as, if not longer than,\r\nthat for the succeeding geological divisions. The Archaean deposits\r\nhave a vertical thickness, in the regions north of the Great Lakes,\r\nestimated at about 65,000 feet, or 12 miles. Their base, as a matter\r\nof fact, has never been reached. It is interesting to note that the\r\ngranites of Norway, Canada, Texas and East Africa have an indicated age\r\nof 1,120,000,000 years, measured in terms of radium products. Prof.\r\nHenry Norris Russell, of Princeton University, concludes, from his\r\ncareful investigations in radioactivity, that the age of the earth is\r\n“a moderate multiple of 1000 million years.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Joly has computed that if there are two parts of radioactive\r\nmaterial for every million million parts of other matter throughout the\r\nwhole volume of the earth, and this is considerably less than he has\r\nfound on the average in the earth’s crust, then this earth, instead of\r\ncooling off, is actually now heating up, so that in a hundred million\r\nyears the temperature of the core will have risen through 1,800 degrees\r\ncentigrade.\r\n\r\nDr. Millikan observes (_Science_, July 9, 1921) that this is a\r\ntemperature “which will melt almost all of our ordinary substances....\r\nIt means that a planet that seems to be dead, as this our earth seems\r\nto be, may, a few eons hence, be a luminous body, and that it may go\r\nthrough periods of expansion when it radiates enormously, and then of\r\ncontraction when it becomes like our present earth, a body which is\r\na heat insulator and holds in its interior the energy given off by\r\nradioactive processes, until another period of luminosity ensues.”\r\n\r\nLord Rayleigh’s series of researches for the purpose of determining\r\nthe quantity of radium present in a number of representative rocks,\r\nboth igneous and sedimentary, seems to prove that the average amount of\r\nradium in the earth’s crust is about 20 times larger than the amount\r\ncalculated by Rutherford to be necessary to retain its temperature\r\nunaltered. Joly’s investigations revealed values in general agreement\r\nwith these, but in many cases he obtained a value several times greater\r\nthan the amount found by Lord Rayleigh. Further investigations showed\r\nthat thorium is as widely distributed as radium in the earth’s crust,\r\nwhich is true also of uranium.\r\n\r\n“Incredible as it may appear,” remarks Rutherford, “the radioactive\r\nbodies must have been steadily radiating energy since the time of their\r\nformation in the earth’s crust. While the activity of uranium itself\r\nmust decrease with the lapse of time, the variation is so slow that an\r\ninterval measured by millions of years would be required to show any\r\ndetectible change.”\r\n\r\nIn his 1921 address to the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, Lord Rayleigh said: “It appears certain that the radioactive\r\nmaterials present in the earth are generating at least as much heat as\r\nis now leaking out from the earth into space. If they are generating\r\nmore than this (and there is evidence to suggest that they are), the\r\ntemperature must, according to all received views, be rising.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAN EPOCH-MAKING DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen radium was discovered by Mme. Curie in 1898, the effect upon\r\nthe scientific world was startling, not to say “catastrophic”--as\r\none author wrote at the time--since its activities ran counter to\r\nevery known principle of physical science. “Some of the most solid\r\nfoundations of science were destroyed, some of its noblest edifices\r\nwrecked, and scientists had to nerve themselves to face and investigate\r\na new form of energy.”\r\n\r\nSo soon as radium compounds (salts) became available, however, the\r\namount of energy given out in radioactive processes--the emission of\r\npowerful radiations which can be transformed into light and heat--was\r\nmeasured; and it was found that radium, weight for weight, gives out\r\nas much heat as any known fuel every three days, and in the course of\r\nfifteen years releases a quantity of energy nearly 2,000 times as much\r\nas is obtained from the best fuel, with no signs of exhaustion (Soddy).\r\nIn the combustion of coal, the heat evolved is sufficient to raise a\r\nweight of water some 80 to 100 times the weight of the fuel from the\r\nfreezing-point to the boiling-point. The spontaneous heat from radium\r\nis sufficient to heat a quantity of water equal to the weight of radium\r\nfrom the freezing-point to the boiling-point every three-quarters of an\r\nhour. In other words, a pound of radium contains and evolves in its\r\nchanges the same amount of energy as 100 tons or more of coal evolve in\r\ntheir combustion.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary chemical changes it is the _molecules_ (groups of\r\natoms) which are altered or rearranged; in radioactive change\r\nthe atoms themselves suffer disintegration and rearrangements.\r\nThe energy of radioactivity, then, is--according to the accepted\r\nview--intra-atomic--stored-up energy within the atom itself. It was\r\ncalculated by Prof. Curie that the energy of one gram of radium would\r\nsuffice to lift a weight of 500 tons to a height of one mile. If it\r\nwere possible to obtain one cubic centimeter (a thimbleful) of the\r\n“emanation” from radium in the form of a gas, we should find that it\r\npossessed the power, altogether, of emitting more than seven million\r\ncalories of heat! A thimbleful of this invisible gas would be more\r\nthan sufficient to raise 15,000 pounds of water 1°. But in every mass\r\nof radium, small or large, not more than 13 trillionths of it is\r\nundergoing change per second.\r\n\r\n“The processes occurring in the radio-elements,” says Rutherford again,\r\n“are of a character quite distinct from any previously observed in\r\nchemistry. Although it has been shown that the radioactivity is due\r\nto the spontaneous and continuous production of new types of active\r\nmatter, the laws which control this production are different from the\r\nlaws of ordinary chemical reactions. It has not been found possible in\r\nany way to alter either the rate at which the matter is produced or its\r\nrate of change when produced. Temperature, which is such an important\r\nfactor in altering the rate of chemical reactions, is, in these cases,\r\nentirely without influence. In addition, no ordinary chemical change is\r\nknown which is accompanied by the expulsion of charged atoms with great\r\nvelocity.... Besides their high atomic weights, [they] do not possess\r\nin common any special chemical characteristics which differentiate them\r\nfrom the other elements.”\r\n\r\nIt was early observed by Curie and Laborde that the temperature of a\r\nradium salt is always a degree or two above that of the atmosphere,\r\nand they estimated that a gram of pure radium would emit about 100\r\ngram-calories per hour. Giesel later showed that radium was always at a\r\ntemperature 5° higher than the surrounding air, regardless of what the\r\ntemperature of the air might be. This continues unchanged whether the\r\ntemperature of the surroundings be 250° below zero Centigrade, or in\r\nthe intense heat of an electric furnace.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” remarks a writer in _The Scientific American_ (February,\r\n1922), “there will come a time when we shall use the energy in the\r\natoms to drive our machines, cook our food and heat our rooms. Besides,\r\nalready today we are actually using--even if only a very tiny part--the\r\natomic energy. Thus, for instance, the rays emanating from radium\r\nare used for therapeutic purposes and the electrons emanating from a\r\nglowing filament can be directed so easily that they can be used in a\r\nlarge number of apparatus for wireless telegraphy and telephony. Most\r\nprobably plants also make use of this energy in their growth because\r\nit has been demonstrated that the rays of the sun liberate electrons\r\nfrom the green leaves, and lastly it may also be mentioned that we\r\nhumans use a little of this intra-atomic energy when seeing with\r\nour eyes, which we are enabled to do by the photoelectric action of\r\nlight.”[A]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the process of disintegration, atoms of uranium\r\nand thorium and their products give rise to no fewer than 36 different\r\nsubstances (A. S. Russell), and of these at least a dozen are “new\r\nelements.”\r\n\r\nAll of the 36 radioactive elements are disintegration products of one\r\nor the other of the two parent elements, uranium and thorium. They are\r\narranged by the chemist in three series: namely, Uranium 1, Uranium 2\r\n(the Actinium Series), and Thorium. In the first series there are known\r\nto be 15 transmutations of matter; in the second, 11; and in the third,\r\n10. The periods of “half change”--the period required for one-half of a\r\ngiven quantity of a radioactive element to decompose--of the different\r\nradioactive elements vary all the way from thousands of millions of\r\nyears for the longest lived primary elements--2.6x10^{10} years for\r\nthorium, 8x10^9 for uranium 1--to .002 second for actinium A. In the\r\ncase of radium itself, 1,670 years are demanded for the disintegration\r\nof half of any portion, according to the exact measurements of Profs.\r\nB. O. Boltwood and Ellen Gleditsch. The stable end product appears to\r\nbe in each case an _isotope_ of lead--leads having similar chemical\r\nproperties but of different _atomic weights_ (_i.e._, different atomic\r\ncomposition).\r\n\r\n    [A] See Shipley, Maynard, “Electricity and Life,” ch. vi.,\r\n        Little Blue Book No. 722.\r\n\r\nIsotopes are groups of elements which cannot be distinguished (or\r\nseparated from) one another by any known chemical methods, and which\r\ndiffer only in the atomic weights of the members of the group. In the\r\nradioactive groups, the various elements differ also in degree of\r\nstability of their atoms.\r\n\r\nChemists cannot actually weigh the mass of an atom of an element on a\r\npair of scales, or by any other method. But if we put down 16 as the\r\n“atomic weight” of oxygen, and ascertain the “combining weight” (ratio)\r\nof hydrogen to oxygen, we can determine the “atomic weight” of hydrogen\r\n(1.008). (See Shipley, “The A B C of the Electron Theory of Matter,”\r\np. 14, Little Blue Book, No. 603.) The ratio of the masses of _any_\r\ntwo elements in a chemical compound can be very accurately determined.\r\nWithout going into the details here, it may be said that the _relative_\r\nweights of the atoms of any element can be determined to 0.01% in many\r\ncases (by chemical analysis and synthesis); while the _actual_ weight\r\nof any atom has not yet been determined to better than 0.1%.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW RADIUM IS CONVERTED TO LEAD\r\n\r\nLead is produced from uranium by a successive series of losses of Alpha\r\nparticles--or helium atoms. Omitting the less essential outcomes, or\r\ntransition stages, we find that each atom of uranium spontaneously\r\nejects three atoms of another element, helium, and thereby is\r\nconverted into still another element, radium. By losing one atom of\r\nhelium, radium, in turn, is converted into the so-called emanation,\r\nor _niton_. The latter quickly loses four more atoms of helium and\r\nis converted into lead, “uranium lead,” having an atomic weight of\r\n206.08. Ordinary (common) lead, constituting the vast bulk of the lead\r\nof the world, has a much higher atomic weight, namely, 207 (Prof.\r\nTheodore Richards). Lead from thorium has an atomic weight of 208; from\r\nactinium, 206. So we have, in fact, four kinds of lead.\r\n\r\nOmitting the less stable transition products, we may say, then, that\r\nan atom of uranium is converted into lead by the loss of eight atoms\r\nof helium--losing three to become radium, then one to become the\r\nemanation, and finally four to become lead. No known human agency can\r\neither retard or hasten this breaking down of the uranium atom into\r\nradium, or of the radium into emanation, with the final production of\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nThis statement has been universally accepted as true. Nevertheless,\r\nDr. A. Glaschler stated (_Nature_ [London], September 12, 1925) that\r\nhe had succeeded in accelerating the change of uranium to uranium X\r\n(the first product of uranium 1) by submitting uranium oxide to “strong\r\nrushes of momentary high-tension currents.” As early as 1923, A. Nodon\r\n(_Comp. rend., 176_, 1705 [1923]) brought forward strong evidence of\r\nan increase of the activity of radioactive substances when outdoors\r\nand enclosed by envelopes of small absorbing power for Gamma rays as\r\ncontrasted to the smaller radioactivity of the same substances in\r\ncellars and when heavily enveloped by lead. For a tentative explanation\r\nof this phenomenon, see _Science_, January 8, 1926 (Vol. LXIII, No.\r\n1619), pp. 44–45.\r\n\r\nBoth uranium and thorium, as we have just stated, break down and become\r\nradium, then change to helium and lead.\r\n\r\nSays Rutherford: “Although thorium is nearly always present in old\r\nuranium minerals and uranium in thorium minerals, there does not appear\r\nto be any radioactive connection between these two elements. Uranium\r\nand thorium are to be regarded as two distinct radioactive elements.\r\n\r\n“With regard to actinium, there is still no definite information of its\r\nplace in the scheme of transformations. Boltwood has shown that the\r\namount of actinium in uranium minerals is proportional to the amount\r\nof uranium. This indicates that actinium, like radium, is in genetic\r\nconnection with uranium....”\r\n\r\nThe recently discovered product, _protoactinium_,--isolated by Hahn and\r\nSoddy,--is the hitherto missing link between uranium Y and actinium.\r\n“This substance emits Alpha rays and has an estimated period of 10,000\r\nyears. The actinium series is believed to have its origin in a dual\r\ntransformation of uranium X. The first branch product, representing\r\nabout 4% of the total, is believed to be uranium Y, a Beta-ray product\r\nof period one day. This is directly transformed into protoactinium.”\r\nThis element has not yet been obtained in a pure state.\r\n\r\nMany of the radioactive elements are isotropic with known chemical\r\nelements--_i.e._, alike in their chemical properties, but dissimilar\r\nin radioactive properties. Since they cannot be distinguished--or\r\nseparated--from the ordinary elements with which they are isotropic, by\r\nany chemical methods, they must occupy the same place in the periodic\r\nclassification of the elements. Radium and mesothorium, for example\r\n(as Soddy was first to show) do not have the same atomic weight, but\r\nthey cannot be distinguished from each other by any chemical methods.\r\nTherefore they both have the atomic _number_ 88, though the atomic\r\n_weight_ of radium is 226 and of mesothorium 228. (See Shipley, “Origin\r\nand Development of the Atomic Theory,” p. 64, Little Blue Book, No.\r\n608.) Radium D and lead, and thorium and ionium, are examples of\r\nradioactive isotropes.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the end-product was first suggested by Boltwood, who\r\npointed out the invariable presence of lead in old radium minerals,\r\nand in amount to be expected from their uranium content and geologic\r\nage. “Thus,” says Prof. T. W. Richards, of Harvard University, “we\r\nmust adopt a kind of limited transmutation of the elements,” although\r\nnot of the immediately profitable type [gold] sought by the ancient\r\nalchemists.”\r\n\r\nSir Ernest Rutherford, who succeeded Sir J. J. Thomson as Cavendish\r\nProfessor of Physics at Cambridge University, was first to recognize\r\nthat the rays from uranium and radium were not all alike, but consisted\r\nof three distinct kinds. In order to distinguish them clearly, without\r\ncommitting himself in advance as to their exact nature, he christened\r\nthem Alpha, Beta, and Gamma rays--the first three letters of the Greek\r\nalphabet. We know now that the Alpha rays are positively charged helium\r\natoms, with two negative electrons missing; that the Beta rays are\r\nnegatively charged electrons (disembodied “particles” of electricity,\r\nexactly like cathode rays); and that the Gamma rays are a type of\r\nX-rays, not material particles but merely extremely short magnetic\r\nwaves or oscillations, akin to ordinary light waves or rays.\r\n\r\nDr. R. A. Millikan calls them “the wireless waves of the denizens of\r\nthe sub-atomic world. They are ether waves, just like light or just\r\nlike wireless waves, except that the vibration frequency ... amounts to\r\n30 billion billions per second. These are the Gamma rays.” This means\r\nthat this number of light waves would pass a given point in space each\r\nsecond. Since these rays do not consist of charged particles they are\r\nnot deflected by electromagnetic or electrostatic fields, as are the\r\nAlpha and Beta rays. It has been found that one gram of radium ejects\r\n136,000,000,000 particles a second!\r\n\r\nThe Gamma rays of radium have such penetrating power that a half-inch\r\nsheet of lead will reduce their original intensity by only one-half,\r\nand they are not absolutely stopped by 20 inches. These invisible\r\nlight waves, thousands of times shorter than those of visible light,\r\nare produced whenever a cathode ray (negative electron) hits matter.\r\nOf the atoms forming the substance penetrated, perhaps only one in a\r\nbillion is struck. It has been said that the Gamma rays (and X-rays)\r\nare the result of the back-kick of ejected electrons. Prof. Comstock\r\nsays that the connection between the Beta rays and the Gamma rays “is\r\nprobably similar to that between the bullet and the sound in the case\r\nof a gun.” However this may be, we know that the Gamma rays are, after\r\nall, in essence only excessively minute light waves. While the longest\r\nvisible light waves are 0.00008 centimeter, the longest Gamma rays are\r\n0.000000013 centimeter; and whereas the shortest visible light waves\r\nare 0.00004 centimeter, the shortest Gamma rays are but 0.0000000007\r\ncentimeter.\r\n\r\nThe Beta particles are ejected with a velocity of from 90,000 to\r\n160,000 miles a second.\r\n\r\nProf. Gustave Le Bon calculated that it would require 340,000 barrels\r\nof powder to discharge one bullet at this inconceivable speed! These\r\nnegatively charged electrons normally revolve around the positively\r\ncharged nucleus. Under certain conditions, an electron will make 2200\r\nbillion revolutions within an atom in one second.\r\n\r\nRadium is not only continually losing matter and energy as electricity,\r\nbut it is also losing energy as heat. Professor and Mme. Curie\r\ndiscovered that any substance placed near radium becomes itself\r\na _false_ radium. This applies to all substances. The acquired\r\nradioactivity persists for many hours, or even days, after the removal\r\nof the radium. In the case of zinc, these secondary radiations were\r\nfound to be four times as intense as ordinary uranium. It vanishes\r\nsooner or later upon the removal from the neighborhood of the potent\r\nradium.\r\n\r\nThe radioactive something which passes out of radium was not the\r\nalready known group of Alpha, Beta and Gamma rays, but an _emanation_\r\nakin to gas. Rutherford, its original discoverer, was not sure that\r\nit was a gas, so he cautiously gave it the name _emanation_. When the\r\nradium was heated, or dissolved in water, the quantity of emanation\r\nwas greatly increased, which seemed to show that it was a gas of\r\nsome kind occluded (bound up) in the radium. The quantity obtained\r\nwas insufficient to bring the emanation within the testing power of\r\nspectroscope or balance.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the emanation has been detected, and investigated by the\r\nelectroscope, which measures the radium rays by the power to discharge\r\nits electrified gold leaves. “The electroscope is about a million\r\ntimes more sensitive than the most sensitive spectroscope and yet the\r\nspectroscope is capable of detecting easily the millionth part of a\r\nmilligram of matter” (Duncan).\r\n\r\nCalculations made by Rutherford show that if a thimbleful of this\r\nactive gas could be collected, the bombardment of its powerful rays\r\nwould heat to a red heat, or even might melt down, the walls of the\r\nglass containing it. The emanation emits only Alpha rays (or particles)\r\nforming helium.\r\n\r\nThe radium from which the emanation has been abstracted, after the\r\nlapse of an hour or so, loses 75% of its activity. During the course\r\nof a single month, radium will be found to have restored all its lost\r\nemanation. In thirty days it will have regained all its original\r\nactivity. It was soon discovered that the emanation abstracted from the\r\nradium loses its radioactivity at the same rate and according to the\r\nsame laws as the de-emanated radium regains it. The radium is therefore\r\nsaid to be “in equilibrium with its products.”\r\n\r\nSince these processes are wholly outside the sphere of known\r\ncontrollable forces, and cannot be created, altered or destroyed--“since\r\nthe process is independent of the chemical form of the radium, whether\r\nbromide, chloride, sulphate, etc., we are absolutely shut up to the\r\nconviction that it is a function of the atom. We are in the presence of\r\nan actual decay of the atom. The atom of radium breaks down into atoms\r\nof emanation and the atoms of emanation in their turn break down into\r\nsomething else. The activity of emanation decays and falls to half value\r\nin about 3.7 days.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the amount of emanation produced from a gram of radium\r\ndoes not amount to more than a needle-point of the gas (= 1.3 cubic\r\nmillimeter), this is sufficient to raise the temperature of 75 grams\r\nof water 1° per hour, which is enough heat to melt _more than its own\r\nweight of ice_ in an hour, and to raise it to the boiling-point in the\r\nnext hour, which is equivalent to 60,000 horse-power days! In other\r\nwords, the heat evolved by the radium emanation is more than 3,500,000\r\ntimes greater than that produced in any known chemical reaction: such\r\nas, for example, the union of oxygen and hydrogen to form water.\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered that if the spectrum of this mysterious gas--or\r\nradium emanation--be examined again after an interval of about four\r\nweeks, it has changed into a familiar spectrum easily recognized as\r\nthat of the gaseous element known as helium. Here the chemist comes\r\nface to face with the astounding fact that the element radium is\r\ndecomposed and produces another element, helium--a discovery made by\r\nRamsay and Soddy in the summer of 1903.\r\n\r\nIn the successive radioactive changes, one Alpha particle (sometimes\r\ncalled “ray”) is ejected from each atom disintegrated by the change--in\r\nsome cases, at least, accompanied by Beta particles (negative\r\nelectrons). The Alpha particle, as already stated, is really an atom of\r\nhelium carrying two atomic charges of positive electricity--twice that\r\nof an atom of hydrogen. Strictly speaking, the Alpha particle is only\r\nthe _nucleus_ of a helium atom, since it has lost two of its negatively\r\ncharged electrons, which are combined in the ordinary helium atom. The\r\nexact velocity of the expelled Alpha particle “varies in the different\r\nradioactive elements” (Joly)--say from 10,000 to 18,000 miles each\r\nsecond--a velocity sufficient to carry the particle around the earth in\r\nless than two seconds, if unchecked.\r\n\r\nBut these relatively heavy particles (of atomic size) are actually soon\r\nchecked, even by seven centimeters (about a third of a foot) of air.\r\nThe Beta particle (1,845 the mass of a hydrogen atom) “shoots a hundred\r\ntimes as far [as the Alpha particle] and the Gamma rays are a hundred\r\ntimes more penetrating still” (Millikan). But the Alpha particle is\r\nsometimes ejected with a velocity nearly 40,000 times that of a rifle\r\nbullet,--the velocity of the latter being about half a mile a second.\r\nEven the super-guns which bombarded Paris could not eject a projectile\r\nwith a speed of more than about a mile a second. Rutherford observes\r\nthat if it were possible to give an equal velocity to an iron cannon\r\nball, the heat generated on a target would be many thousand times more\r\nthan sufficient to melt the cannon ball and dissipate it into vapor.\r\n\r\nThe flashes of light seen when the Alpha rays bombard a screen of zinc\r\nsulphide, as in Crookes’ spinthariscope, are due to cleavages produced\r\nin the zinc sulphide crystals by the impact of the Alpha rays (positive\r\nions). Each impact on a crystal produces a splash of light big enough\r\nto be seen by a microscope.\r\n\r\nIn the phosphorescence caused by the approach of an emanation of radium\r\nto zinc sulphate, the atoms throw off the Alpha (helium) particles to\r\nthe number of five billion each second, with velocities of 10,000 miles\r\nor more a second. If the helium projectile should chance to “crash”\r\ninto an atom of nitrogen or of oxygen, an atom of hydrogen can be\r\nknocked out of it, as was discovered by Sir Ernest Rutherford, perhaps\r\nthe most distinguished of Mme. Curie’s pupils. (Strictly speaking, the\r\ndisintegration particles are isotropes of helium, of atomic weight\r\n3, the atomic weight of helium being 4.) Despite its large size as\r\ncompared with an electron (or Beta particle), the Alpha particle passes\r\nthrough a glass wall without leaving a hole behind, and without in any\r\nway interfering with the molecules of the glass. It shoots through\r\nhundreds of thousands of atoms without ever going near enough to them\r\nto be deflected from its course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nRADIUM IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action of radium on human tissues was unknown until 1896, when\r\nProf. Henri Becquerel of Paris, having incautiously carried a lump of\r\npitchblende in his pocket, discovered on his skin, within two weeks, a\r\nsevere inflammation, or ulcer, which was known as the famous “Becquerel\r\nburn.” As physicians of the nineteenth century were accustomed to\r\nburn out cancers with caustics, the idea occurred to them that the\r\napplication of radium might prove to be an improvement on the older\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nIt has proved to be so, affording in many cases not only relief,\r\nbut in some instances, even a cure, not only for cancer, but for\r\nmany other ailments--as we shall see presently. Since that time\r\nactive investigation into the action of radium on diseased tissues\r\nhas been carried on, resulting in the establishment in Paris of\r\nthe “_Laboratoire biologique du Radium_,” and also of the Radium\r\nInstitute of Vienna, followed by the establishment of somewhat similar\r\ninstitutions in various other countries, notably in England and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous institutions for radiotherapy is the recently\r\nestablished Radium Institute of Paris, under the management of Mme.\r\nCurie and Professor Debierne. This is composed of two distinct\r\ncompartments. In one the scientific properties of radium are studied,\r\nwhile the other is devoted to its therapeutic applications. Dr. Regaud,\r\nwho is in charge of the latter department (a branch of the widely known\r\nPasteur Institute), endeavors to cure cancer and tumors by application\r\nof radium and X-rays.\r\n\r\nNew York City boasts a magnificently equipped Radium Institute, under\r\nthe directorship of Dr. C. Everett Field. And an even more famous\r\ninstitution is that founded by the Mayo brothers, in Rochester,\r\nMinnesota, where these eminent surgeons had accumulated an entire\r\ngram of radium as early, at least, as 1920--the largest amount owned\r\nby private individuals. This great institution--now known as the Mayo\r\nFoundation--is no longer privately owned, but it is still under the\r\ndirection of the Mayos.\r\n\r\nRadiotherapy (or, in France, _curietherapy_, in honor of the discoverer\r\nof radium) or the treatment of various diseases by radioactive\r\nsubstances, has not been applied so extensively as has treatment by\r\nX-rays (Roentgen rays), produced in vacuum tubes. On the other hand,\r\nthe X-rays are not so effective (as usually applied) in the treatment\r\nof certain morbid conditions as are the more penetrating Gamma rays\r\nfrom radioactive substances; though the latter are essentially\r\nidentical with X-rays--swift Beta particles, or negative electrons--of\r\nvery short wave-length. To produce X-rays as penetrating as the Gamma\r\nrays, about two million volts would have to be “cut” on the discharge\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nThe Alpha rays are not often used in medical practice, and have little\r\npenetrating power. They are stopped by 3½ cm. of air, or by a thin\r\nsheet of paper. They are employed only in the way of radium “emanation”\r\n(a gas) dissolved in saline solution, or by the use of needles upon\r\nwhich active deposit from radium emanation has been collected. “In\r\neither case the emanation water or the active deposit needles must be\r\nintroduced into the system--whether intravenously or into the solid\r\ntissues,--otherwise the Alpha rays would have no power to act. In\r\neither case, too, they act along with the Beta and Gamma rays produced\r\nby the active deposit” (Lozarus-Barlow).\r\n\r\nBeta radiation is used only for superficial conditions and always in\r\nconjunction with Gamma radiation. “Instead of a radium salt, one of\r\nits products, viz., radium emanation, is often employed chemically.\r\nNo essential difference is introduced by the use of this emanation\r\nexcepting that its intensity undergoes a progressive diminution with\r\ntime, since it falls to half value in 3.85 days. Early rodent cancer,\r\ncertain conditions of the eyelids, some cutaneous non-malignant tumors\r\nand birth-marks, are treated successfully in this way.”\r\n\r\nPhysicians of the Memorial Hospital, New York City, announced in\r\nOctober, 1925, that by filtering out 90% of the caustic Beta rays\r\nemanating from radium and the high voltage X-ray tube, and using\r\nprincipally the healing and stimulating Gamma rays, radiation treatment\r\nof cancer of the tongue, lips, nose, ears or other part of the head has\r\nbeen greatly improved.\r\n\r\nIn the first six months after the new method was begun, more than 100\r\ncases had been treated with what were considered very satisfactory\r\nresults. Owing to the elimination of the caustic rays, much stronger\r\napplications of the beneficial rays can be used, and painful effects\r\nare largely obviated.\r\n\r\nIf experience and special research lead eventually to successful\r\ntreatment of cancer, it will be a great boon to the human race. The\r\nUnited States leads the world in deaths from this dread disease, with\r\nits average of 90 per 100,000 of the population. The mean average of\r\ncancer deaths in Europe is 76, in Asia 54, in Africa 33, in Oceania\r\n73. Several races, including the American Indians, are stated to\r\nbe entirely free from cancer, and others are partially immune. The\r\nJapanese, for example, are subject to all forms except cancer of the\r\nbreast. Eighty-five percent of Americans afflicted with this malady are\r\npersons over 40 years of age.\r\n\r\nScience Service states that a careful analysis of cancer statistics\r\ngathered by the United States Census Bureau over a period of about 20\r\nyears in ten Eastern states reveals definitely that cancer mortality\r\nis from 25 to 30% higher than it was about 20 years ago. This is the\r\nclaim of Dr. J. W. Schereschewsky, of the United States Public Health\r\nService, who made the statistical analysis and reported it to the\r\nAmerican Medical Association. “There has been a pronounced increase in\r\nthe observed death rate from cancer in persons 40 years old and over in\r\nthe ten states comprising the original death registration area,” Dr.\r\nSchereschewsky said. “Part of this increase is due to greater precision\r\nand accuracy in the filling out of death returns, but the remainder is\r\nan actual increase in the mortality of the disease.”\r\n\r\nThe only way to stop the ravages of cancer, says the Paris Academy of\r\nMedicine, is to diagnose it early--in time for operation. For this\r\nto be practicable, physicians must be specially instructed. Family\r\ndoctors are often ignorant of all but a few forms of cancer and do\r\nnot recognize it in its first manifestations. Women of 40 to 50 are\r\napt to consider little irregularities of bleeding to be associated\r\nwith the menopause and therefore harmless. Often this is right, but\r\nunfortunately the bleeding from an early cancer may not differ in the\r\nslightest degree from such harmless irregularities and by the time\r\nother symptoms have developed, the cancer has perhaps grown through\r\nthe wall of the uterus and has spread to regions where no treatment\r\ncan hope to reach it. The only safe rule to go by is to seek expert\r\ninvestigation for any unusual or irregular bleeding or discharge,\r\nhowever slight, especially if these occur at or near the “change of\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nOne phase of this subject of special interest is that of the use of\r\nradium in the treatment of cancer, especially of the neck or lower\r\nend of the uterus. There is already sufficient evidence to warrant\r\nthe statement that some cancers of this region have been permanently\r\ncured by radium alone. And as a relief measure in the late and hopeless\r\nstages of the disease, radium prolongs life, relieves pain and adds\r\nmuch to the comfort of the victim.\r\n\r\nIt has been amply demonstrated that radium treatment increases the\r\npermanency of the results obtained by surgery, and often converts\r\ninoperable into operable cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nEFFICIENCY OF RADIUM IN TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1923, Dr. R. E. Loucks, president of the American Radium Society,\r\nannounced that toxic goiter had been cured by radium. Exophthalmic\r\ngoiter has been, in most cases, successfully treated by irradiation.\r\nJust how the cure is effected is still unknown; for the thyroid body\r\nfrom animals exposed for many hours to the Gamma irradiations of\r\nradium bromide shows no perceptible histological changes. Yet far\r\nless radiation produces marked changes in the tadpoles derived from\r\nnormal ova fertilized by spermatazoa which have been radiated in the\r\nfrog, though no testicular changes can be detected with certainty\r\n(Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. 32, p. 224, 12th Ed.).\r\n\r\nAmong other diseases which have been more or less successfully\r\ntreated by radium may be mentioned lupus vulgarus, epithelial tumors,\r\nsyphilitic ulcers, chronic itching of the skin, papillomata (an\r\nepithelial tumor formed by hypertrophy of the papillae of the skin\r\nor mucuous membrane, as a corn or a wart), angiomata (tumor composed\r\nchiefly of dilated blood or lymph vessels), pigmentary naevi (blemish\r\nof the skin due to pigment, as a birth-mark), and pruritus (itching).\r\nRadium has been particularly effective in treating serious affections\r\nof the eyes, as was first fully demonstrated by Dr. Walter S. Franklin\r\nand Frederick C. Cordes, of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant successes of radium have been in those cases “where\r\nsome serious complicating ailment, such as heart disease, tuberculosis,\r\nBright’s disease, or an extreme anemia, contra-indicates anesthesia\r\nor any procedure which will tax the patient’s vital resources; radium\r\nsteps in and does its work quietly, imperceptibly and, indeed, without\r\nthe slightest risk to life.”\r\n\r\nDr. Howard A. Kelly, of Johns Hopkins University, has been very\r\nsuccessful in curing swollen masses of glands on the sides of the neck,\r\ncancer of the thyroid and of the cervix, and sarcoma of the chest.\r\nDr. E. S. Molyneaux of London, has cured obdurate cases of tubercular\r\nglands in the neck, a disease rather frequent among children. Thanks\r\nto the patient researches of Dr. John A. Marshall, associate professor\r\nof biochemistry and dental pathology at the University of California,\r\nit is now known that a radioactive liquid may be used for sterilizing\r\ninfected tissue. Experiments employing the radioactive liquid in the\r\ntreatment of root canals have been conducted at the George Williams\r\nHooper Foundation for Medical Research and at the College of Dentistry\r\nof the University of California.\r\n\r\nWithin the time that the new antiseptic has been in use at these\r\ncolleges, 85% of all the cases treated have been successful; and,\r\nwith one exception, no soreness or pain has followed its use. This\r\nradioactive preparation is a solution of radium salts, “Radium D plus\r\nE,” which results from the decomposition of radium emanation, which,\r\nreadily soluble in water, possesses definite radioactive properties. In\r\nmaking the solution the tiny capillary tubes containing the decomposed\r\nradium are crushed under water in a mortar and the liquid is then ready\r\nfor use in the treatment of an ulcerated root of a tooth.\r\n\r\nDr. Marshall had been working with radium for months before\r\nadmitting the success of his investigations, which were conducted\r\nin a long series of experiments on the lower animals. “Microscopic\r\nexaminations of abscessed tissue,” he said, “which have been treated\r\nwith radioactive solutions, indicate that the bacteria producing the\r\naffection were killed. And in no cases observed has the treatment\r\nproduced radium burns; the amounts used have been too small and the\r\neffects of too transitory a nature. That sterilization of tissue can be\r\nproduced, however, seems apparent.\r\n\r\n“The discovery is purely of academic interest because of the fact\r\nthat radium is too expensive, and it is possible to obtain it only in\r\nlimited quantities; so that the chief value of the discovery will rest\r\nin the fact that it will stimulate further work for the identification\r\nof more accessible material.”\r\n\r\nIn external treatment by radium itself, emanations from a certain\r\nquantity of radium are allowed to focus on parts of the body over the\r\ndiseased organs. Thus the curative functions of the diseased portion\r\nare stimulated to activity. The atrophying of diseased tonsils has\r\nbeen the most successful use of this form of treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the destruction of disease germs the radium emanation has been\r\nfound more useful than the direct rays. The emanations kill or check\r\nthe growth of anthrax, typhoid, and diphtheric germs. The direct\r\nrays are efficient in the relief of severe cases of enurites and\r\nfacial neuralgia, cancer, tumors, affections of the skin and abnormal\r\ngrowths. Dr. Guyenot has proved that radium effects a complete cure for\r\nrheumatism, which he accounts for in these words: “Uric acid circulates\r\nin the blood in the form of urate of soda, of which there are two\r\nisomeric forms differing from each other by their respective solubility\r\nin the blood plasms. The soluble salt is converted into an insoluble\r\nform.” Radium breaks up this compound. The “rheumatism” disappears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWHERE WE GET RADIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extraction process consists in eliminating the various substances\r\nin the ore until only the radium salts are left. But, in the case of\r\ncarnotite, more than 900 different operations, requiring six months of\r\nlabor, are required between the digging of the ore and the production\r\nof a gram of pure radium salt. A solution containing barium and radium\r\nsalts in the ratio of ten parts of radium to a billion is treated with\r\nsulphate to precipitate an insoluble “raw sulphate of barium.”\r\n\r\nRadium ores are generally found in connection with granitic\r\nmasses--_i.e._, in places where granite forms at least part of the\r\nrock of the country. The carnotite ore usually consists of a thin\r\nlayer of sandstone which crops out on the side of a canyon wall and is\r\nrecognized by the characteristic sulphur-yellow color. The narrow seams\r\nare usually in the form of pockets, so that the value of a claim is\r\ndubious until it has been thoroughly explored and worked.\r\n\r\nMost of the original radium minerals, such as uraninite, samarskite,\r\nand brannerite, are black and have a shiny fracture and a high specific\r\ngravity. These minerals are, however, rarely found in commercially\r\nvaluable quantities.\r\n\r\nPitchblende, the richest source of radium, has the same composition\r\nas uraninite and the same general appearance, except that it shows\r\nno crystal form. It occurs in veins. There are extensive deposits of\r\npitchblende or uraninite at Joachimstahl, Bohemia (Czecho-Slovakia),\r\ncontaining from 30 to 70 per cent uranium oxide, from which the radium\r\nis extracted. But here the uranium ore occurs in small pockets in\r\nwidely separated localities, so that it is merely a by-product of other\r\nmining operations. However, after separation of the uranium from the\r\nore, the residues are three to five times as radioactive, weight for\r\nweight, as the uranium. The amount of radium in old unaltered mineral\r\nis always proportional to its content of uranium in the ratio of 3.3\r\nparts of radium by weight to ten million parts of uranium.\r\n\r\nNew radium ore fields were discovered in Czecho-Slovakia in 1922. The\r\nproduction of radium in that country increased from .7746 gram in 1911,\r\nto 1.7118 grams in 1915, and 2.2310 grams in 1920. In 1922, steps were\r\ntaken to modernize the plants in the Jachcymov district (Bohemia),\r\nwhere the known supply will last 20 years at the present rate of\r\nproduction--a little more than two grams a year.\r\n\r\nThe famous Joachimstahl pitchblende deposits were a monopoly of the\r\nAustrian Government before the World War, but they are now being\r\nworked by the Imperial and Foreign Corporation of London, under an\r\nagreement with the Czecho-Slovak Government. In 1922 a loan of two\r\ngrams of radium (valued at more than $300,000) was made to Oxford\r\nUniversity, for a period of fifteen years. This material is being used\r\nfor experimental purposes by Prof. Frederick Soddy, of Oxford, and his\r\nassociates. It has been stated that one of the chief objectives is\r\nthe discovery of a method for the release and control of intra-atomic\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nPitchblende has been found in only a few places--in Bohemia\r\n(Czecho-Slovakia), southern Saxony, Cornwall, and Gilpin County,\r\nColorado. So far, this ore has not been the source of any radium\r\nproduced in this country.\r\n\r\nWhen the original radium minerals (uraninite, samarskite, brannerite,\r\netc.) break down through weathering, other radium minerals are formed\r\nfrom them, such as autunite, trobernite, carnotite, and tyuyamunite.\r\nThe two latter ores are the most widespread and abundant. Autunite, a\r\nphosphate of calcium and uranium, is as active as uranium. Carnotite\r\nand tyuyamunite cannot be distinguished visually from each other.\r\nBoth are a bright canary-yellow in color, and are powdery, finely\r\ncrystalline, or, rarely, clay-like in texture. Both these minerals are\r\nfound in the same section of Utah and of Colorado, usually associated\r\nwith fossil wood and other vegetation, in friable, porous, fine-grained\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nThe only other deposits that yield tyuyamunite in marked quantity are\r\nthose of Tyua-Muyun, in the Andiyan district, Ferghana Government,\r\ncentral Asiatic Russia (Russian Turkestan), where it occurs with rich\r\ncopper ores in a pipe in limestone.\r\n\r\nThe radium salts--hydrous sulphate, chloride, or bromide--are all white\r\nor nearly white substances, no more remarkable in appearance than\r\ncommon salt. Neither radium nor the radium minerals are in themselves\r\nluminescent. Tubes containing radium salts glow because they include\r\nimpurities which the invisible radiations from the radium cause to give\r\nlight. The pure radium metal has been isolated only two or three times,\r\nand few persons have seen it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SOURCES OF RADIUM\r\n\r\nIn 1921, a rich deposit of pitchblende was discovered in the province\r\nof Ontario, Canada. Since 1921 there has been a rather considerable\r\nexportation of radioactive minerals from Madagascar; and in 1922\r\ndeposits of uranium oxide (U_3O_8) were discovered in Switzerland.\r\nDuring the same year an unknown Belgian traveler sold to a curio dealer\r\na strange stone picked up in the Congo. The dealer sold it to the\r\nBritish Museum. Upon examination the stone was found to be radioactive.\r\nBelgian geologists were immediately informed, and a Belgian mission\r\nwas sent to the Katanga district, where the stone was found. Two veins\r\nof chalcolite (torbernite) containing substances rich in radium were\r\nsoon located by the geologists, one near the Portuguese frontier.\r\nChalcolite, the crystallized phosphate of copper and uranium, is twice\r\nas active as uranium.\r\n\r\nThe newly discovered mineral has been given the name “curite,”\r\nin honor of Mme. Curie, the discoverer of radium. These deposits\r\nare now known to be the richest in the world. And, what is hardly\r\nless important, the radium may be isolated by simple dissolution in\r\nnitric acid, even in the cold. It is also readily dissolved in warm\r\nhydrochloric acid. Only 15 tons of the ore need to be treated to\r\nproduce a gram of radium.\r\n\r\nCurite is found in three forms, as translucent reddish brown\r\nneedle-like crystals; as compact saccharoid crystalline aggregates,\r\norange in color; and as orange-colored earthy masses surrounding the\r\npreceding variety. The chemical composition is expressed by the formula\r\n2(PbO)5(UO_3)4(H_2O).\r\n\r\nIn 1924 a pitchblende deposit, very rich in radium, was discovered in\r\nFerghana, in Russian Turkestan. Soviet Russia is now mining the ore and\r\nextracting the radium, which is kept at the Radium Institute of the\r\nAcademy of Science.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, more than $500,000 worth of radium has been added to\r\nthe world’s store of this valuable element by “boiling down” British\r\ncannons used in the World War. No fewer than five grams--less than a\r\ntablespoonful--have been secured by British scientists by this process.\r\nThe radium is stored in a lead safe weighing almost two tons--a\r\ncontainer which was invented by a Dr. Kuss, and the composition of\r\nwhich is known only to himself. One of the greatest difficulties of\r\nscientists has been to find some material which would prevent the\r\nconstant bombardment of the radium rays.\r\n\r\nOne important result of these recent discoveries--especially that of\r\nthe Congo deposits--is that the price of radium dropped $30,000 a gram,\r\nand sells now at the rate of $70,000 a gram instead of some $100,000.\r\nThe Standard Chemical Company of Denver, Colorado, has been obliged to\r\nclose down its three-story laboratory, which until the close of the\r\nyear 1922 had, for several years previously, been producing a million\r\ndollars’ worth of radium annually. The Paradox Valley carnotite ore\r\ncannot be worked in competition with the rich deposits of the Belgian\r\nCongo. It has been stated that five pounds annually could be produced\r\nfrom these Congo deposits. The Colorado company had been selling at the\r\nrate of $58,500,000 a pound. The Congo company can profitably sell the\r\nprecious element at $29,250,000 less a pound.\r\n\r\nSo, unless war breaks out again to prevent shipments from abroad, the\r\nUnited States of America will produce no more radium for a long while\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RADIOACTIVE DISINTEGRATION SERIES\r\n\r\nIn order to show the decomposition products of the two parent\r\nradioactive elements--Uranium and Thorium--and their chief\r\ncharacteristics, together with their relations to one another, and the\r\ntime required for the product (element) to be half transformed, it is\r\ncustomary to arrange them in a _disintegration series_. There are\r\nthree series, Uranium I, Uranium Y, and Thorium.\r\n\r\nIn the first table given below is shown how the series known as\r\nUranium I is transformed into the end-product, uranium lead. This is\r\nfollowed by the Uranium Y (or Actinium) series, and by the Thorium\r\nseries; the end-product of all three being a characteristic type of\r\nlead. In the tables T is the “time-period” of a product, or the time\r\nrequired for the product to be _half transformed_. In the column\r\n“Rays” is shown what type of ray, or rays, is, or are, emitted during\r\nthe disintegration process--A=Alpha rays (or particles), B=Beta\r\nrays (negative electrons), and G=Gamma rays (or X-rays of very high\r\n“frequency”).\r\n\r\n“In the great majority of cases,” says Sir Ernest Rutherford, “each\r\nof the radioactive elements breaks up in a definite way, giving rise\r\nto one Alpha or Beta particle and to one atom of the new product.\r\nUndoubted evidence, however, has been obtained that in a few cases the\r\natoms break up in two or more distinct ways, giving rise to two or more\r\nproducts characterized by different radioactive properties. A branching\r\nof the uranium series was early demanded in order to account for the\r\norigin of Actinium.”\r\n\r\nIn the first column is given the “atomic weight” of each radioactive\r\nelement, the weight decreasing with (almost) every “disintegration\r\nperiod.” The figures followed by an interrogation point are\r\nRutherford’s, and indicate that slightly different figures are given by\r\nother authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nURANIUM I SERIES\r\n\r\n                                    T (average       Rays (given out in\r\n          Element        Atomic  time-period--half          each\r\n                         Weight    transformed)        decomposition)\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Uranium I               238    4.5 × 10^9 yrs.
