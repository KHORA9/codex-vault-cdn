A. HIGGINS\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Its History\r\n\r\nThe Colorado is one of the great rivers of North America. Formed in\r\nSouthern Utah by the confluence of the Green and Grand, it intersects\r\nthe northwestern corner of Arizona, and, becoming the eastern boundary\r\nof Nevada and California, flows southward until it reaches tidewater in\r\nthe Gulf of California, Mexico. It drains a territory of 300,000 square\r\nmiles, and, traced back to the rise of its principal source, is 2,000\r\nmiles long. At two points, Needles and Yuma on the California boundary,\r\nit is crossed by a railroad. Elsewhere its course lies far from\r\nCaucasian settlements and far from the routes of common travel, in the\r\nheart of a vast region fenced on the one hand by arid plains or deep\r\nforests and on the other by formidable mountains.\r\n\r\nThe early Spanish explorers first reported it to the civilized world in\r\n1540, two separate expeditions becoming acquainted with the river for a\r\ncomparatively short distance above its mouth, and another, journeying\r\nfrom the Moki Pueblos northwestward across the desert, obtaining the\r\nfirst view of the Big Canyon, failing in every effort to descend the\r\ncanyon wall, and spying the river only from afar.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1776, a Spanish priest traveling southward through Utah struck\r\noff from the Virgin River to the southeast and found a practicable\r\ncrossing at a point that still bears the name “Vado de los Padres.”\r\n\r\nFor more than eighty years thereafter the Big Canyon remained unvisited\r\nexcept by the Indian, the Mormon herdsman, and the trapper, although the\r\nSitgreaves expedition of 1851, journeying westward, struck the river\r\nabout 150 miles above Yuma, and Lieutenant Whipple in 1854 made a survey\r\nfor a practicable railroad route along the thirty-fifth parallel, where\r\nthe Santa Fe Pacific has since been constructed.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of military posts in New Mexico and Utah having made\r\ndesirable the use of a waterway for the cheap transportation of\r\nsupplies, in 1857 the War Department dispatched an expedition in charge\r\nof Lieutenant Ives to explore the Colorado as far from its mouth as\r\nnavigation should be found practicable. Ives ascended the river in a\r\nspecially constructed steamboat to the head of Black Canyon, a few miles\r\nbelow the confluence of the Virgin River in Nevada, where further\r\nnavigation became impossible; then, returning to the Needles, he set off\r\nacross the country toward the northeast. He reached the Big Canyon at\r\nDiamond Creek and at Cataract Creek in the spring of 1858, and from the\r\nlatter point made a wide southward detour around the San Francisco\r\nPeaks, thence northeastward to the Moki Pueblos, thence eastward to Fort\r\nDefiance, and so back to civilization.\r\n\r\nThat is the history of the explorations of the Colorado up to forty\r\nyears ago. Its exact course was unknown for many hundred miles, even its\r\norigin being a matter of conjecture. It was difficult to approach within\r\na distance of two or three miles from the channel, while descent to the\r\nriver’s edge could be hazarded only at wide intervals, inasmuch as it\r\nlay in an appalling fissure at the foot of seemingly impassable cliff\r\nterraces that led down from the bordering plateau; and to attempt its\r\nnavigation was to court death. It was known in a general way that the\r\nentire channel between Nevada and Utah was of the same titanic\r\ncharacter, reaching its culmination nearly midway in its course through\r\nArizona.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: The Colorado, Foot of Bright Angel Trail.]\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Maj. J. W. Powell undertook the exploration of the river with\r\nnine men and four boats, starting from Green River City, on the Green\r\nRiver, in Utah. The project met with the most urgent remonstrance from\r\nthose who were best acquainted with the region, including the Indians,\r\nwho maintained that boats could not possibly live in any one of a score\r\nof rapids and falls known to them, to say nothing of the vast unknown\r\nstretches in which at any moment a Niagara might be disclosed. It was\r\nalso currently believed that for hundreds of miles the river disappeared\r\nwholly beneath the surface of the earth. Powell launched his flotilla on\r\nMay 24th, and on August 30th landed at the mouth of the Virgin River,\r\nmore than one thousand miles by the river channel from the place of\r\nstarting, minus two boats and four men. One of the men had left the\r\nexpedition by way of an Indian reservation agency before reaching\r\nArizona, and three, after holding out against unprecedented terrors for\r\nmany weeks, had finally become daunted, choosing to encounter the perils\r\nof an unknown desert rather than to brave any longer the frightful\r\nmenaces of that Stygian torrent. These three, unfortunately making their\r\nappearance on the plateau at a time when a recent depredation was\r\ncolorably chargeable upon them, were killed by Indians, their story of\r\nhaving come thus far down the river in boats being wholly discredited by\r\ntheir captors.\r\n\r\nPowell’s journal of the trip is a fascinating tale, written in a compact\r\nand modest style, which, in spite of its reticence, tells an epic story\r\nof purest heroism. It definitely established the scene of his\r\nexploration as the most wonderful geological and spectacular phenomenon\r\nknown to mankind, and justified the name which had been bestowed upon\r\nit—The Grand Canyon—sublimest of gorges; Titan of chasms. Many\r\nscientists have since visited it, and, in the aggregate, a large number\r\nof unprofessional lovers of nature; but until a few years ago no\r\nadequate facilities were provided for the general sight-seer, and the\r\nworld’s most stupendous panorama was known principally through report,\r\nby reason of the discomforts and difficulties, of the trip, which\r\ndeterred all except the most indefatigable enthusiasts. Even its\r\ngeographical location is the subject of widespread misapprehension.\r\n\r\nIts title has been pirated for application to relatively insignificant\r\ncanyons in distant parts of the country, and thousands of tourists have\r\nbeen led to believe that they saw the Grand Canyon, when, in fact, they\r\nlooked upon a totally different scene, between which and the real Grand\r\nCanyon there is no more comparison “than there is between the\r\nAlleghanies or Trosachs and the Himalayas.”\r\n\r\nThere is but one Grand Canyon. Nowhere in the world has its like been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          As Seen From the Rim\r\n\r\nStolid, indeed, is he who can front the awful scene and view its\r\nunearthly splendor of color and form without quaking knee or tremulous\r\nbreath. An inferno, swathed in soft celestial fires; a whole chaotic\r\nunder-world, just emptied of primeval floods and waiting for a new\r\ncreative word; eluding all sense of perspective or dimension,\r\noutstretching the faculty of measurement, overlapping the confines of\r\ndefinite apprehension; a boding, terrible thing, unflinchingly real, yet\r\nspectral as a dream. The beholder is at first unimpressed by any detail;\r\nhe is overwhelmed by the _ensemble_ of a stupendous panorama, a thousand\r\nsquare miles in extent, that lies wholly beneath the eye, as if he stood\r\nupon a mountain peak instead of the level brink of a fearful chasm in\r\nthe plateau, whose opposite shore is thirteen miles away. A labyrinth of\r\nhuge architectural forms, endlessly varied in design, fretted with\r\nornamental devices, festooned with lace-like webs formed of talus from\r\nthe upper cliffs and painted with every color known to the palette in\r\npure transparent tones of marvelous delicacy. Never was picture more\r\nharmonious, never flower more exquisitely beautiful. It flashes instant\r\ncommunication of all that architecture and painting and music for a\r\nthousand years have gropingly striven to express. It is the soul of\r\nMichael Angelo and of Beethoven.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Copyright, 1899, by H. G. Peabody.\r\n                    The River and the Canyon Wall.]\r\n\r\nA canyon, truly, but not after the accepted type. An intricate system of\r\ncanyons, rather, each subordinate to the river channel in the midst,\r\nwhich in its turn is subordinate to the whole effect. That river\r\nchannel, the profoundest depth, and actually more than 6,000 feet below\r\nthe point of view, is in seeming a rather insignificant trench,\r\nattracting the eye more by reason of its somber tone and mysterious\r\nsuggestion than by any appreciable characteristic of a chasm. It is\r\nperhaps five miles distant in a straight line, and its uppermost rims\r\nare nearly 4,000 feet beneath the observer, whose measuring capacity is\r\nentirely inadequate to the demand made by such magnitudes. One can not\r\nbelieve the distance to be more than a mile as the crow flies, before\r\ndescending the wall or attempting some other form of actual measurement.\r\n\r\nMere brain knowledge counts for little against the illusion under which\r\nthe organ of vision is here doomed to labor. Yonder cliff, darkening\r\nfrom white to gray, yellow, and brown as your glance descends, is taller\r\nthan the Washington Monument. The Auditorium in Chicago would not cover\r\none-half its perpendicular span. Yet it does not greatly impress you.\r\nYou idly toss a pebble toward it, and are surprised to note how far the\r\nmissile falls short. By and by you will learn that it is a good half\r\nmile distant, and when you go down the trail you will gain an abiding\r\nsense of its real proportions. Yet, relatively, it is an unimportant\r\ndetail of the scene. Were Vulcan to cast it bodily into the chasm\r\ndirectly beneath your feet, it would pass for a bowlder, if, indeed, it\r\nwere discoverable to the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nYet the immediate chasm itself is only the first step of a long terrace\r\nthat leads down to the innermost gorge and the river. Roll a heavy stone\r\nto the rim and let it go. It falls sheer the height of a church or an\r\nEiffel Tower, according to the point selected for such pastime, and\r\nexplodes like a bomb on a projecting ledge. If, happily, any\r\nconsiderable fragments remain, they bound onward like elastic balls,\r\nleaping in wild parabola from point to point, snapping trees like\r\nstraws; bursting, crashing, thundering down the declivities until they\r\nmake a last plunge over the brink of a void; and then there comes\r\nlanguidly up the cliff sides a faint, distant roar, and your bowlder\r\nthat had withstood the buffets of centuries lies scattered as wide as\r\nWycliffe’s ashes, although the final fragment has lodged only a little\r\nway, so to speak, below the rim. Such performances are frequently given\r\nin these amphitheaters without human aid, by the mere undermining of the\r\nrain, or perhaps it is here that Sisyphus rehearses his unending task.\r\nOften in the silence of night some tremendous fragment has been heard\r\ncrashing from terrace to terrace with shocks like thunder peal.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle is so symmetrical, and so completely excludes the outside\r\nworld and its accustomed standards, it is with difficulty one can\r\nacquire any notion of its immensity. Were it half as deep, half as\r\nbroad, it would be no less bewildering, so utterly does it baffle human\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Trip to the River\r\n\r\nOnly by descending into the canyon may one arrive at anything like\r\ncomprehension of its proportions, and the descent can not be too\r\nurgently commended to every visitor who is sufficiently robust to bear a\r\nreasonable amount of fatigue. There are four paths down the southern\r\nwall of the canyon in the granite gorge district—Mystic Spring, Bright\r\nAngel, Berry’s and Hance’s trails. The following account of a descent of\r\nthe old Hance trail will serve to indicate the nature of such an\r\nexperience to-day, except that the trip may now be safely made with\r\ngreater comfort.\r\n\r\nFor the first two miles it is a sort of Jacob’s ladder, zigzagging at an\r\nunrelenting pitch. At the end of two miles a comparatively gentle slope\r\nis reached, known as the blue limestone level, some 2,500 feet below the\r\nrim, that is to say—for such figures have to be impressed objectively\r\nupon the mind—five times the height of St. Peter’s, the Pyramid of\r\nCheops, or the Strasburg Cathedral; eight times the height of the\r\nBartholdi Statue of Liberty; eleven times the height of Bunker Hill\r\nMonument. Looking back from this level the huge picturesque towers that\r\nborder the rim shrink to pigmies and seem to crown a perpendicular wall,\r\nunattainably far in the sky. Yet less than one-half the descent has been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nOvershadowed by sandstone of chocolate hue the way grows gloomy and\r\nforeboding, and the gorge narrows. The traveler stops a moment beneath a\r\nslanting cliff 500 feet high, where there is an Indian grave and pottery\r\nscattered about. A gigantic niche has been worn in the face of this\r\ncavernous cliff, which, in recognition of its fancied Egyptian\r\ncharacter, was named the Temple of Sett by the painter, Thomas Moran.\r\n\r\nA little beyond this temple it becomes necessary to abandon the animals.\r\nThe river is still a mile and a half distant. The way narrows now to a\r\nmere notch, where two wagons could barely pass, and the granite begins\r\nto tower gloomily overhead, for we have dropped below the sandstone and\r\nhave entered the archæan—a frowning black rock, streaked, veined, and\r\nswirled with vivid red and white, smoothed and polished by the rivulet\r\nand beautiful as a mosaic. Obstacles are encountered in the form of\r\nsteep, interposing crags, past which the brook has found a way, but over\r\nwhich the pedestrian must clamber. After these lesser difficulties come\r\nsheer descents, which at present are passed by the aid of ropes.\r\n\r\nThe last considerable drop is a 40-foot bit by the side of a pretty\r\ncascade, where there are just enough irregularities in the wall to give\r\ntoe-hold. The narrowed cleft becomes exceedingly wayward in its course,\r\nturning abruptly to right and left, and working down into twilight\r\ndepth. It is very still. At every turn one looks to see the embouchure\r\nupon the river, anticipating the sudden shock of the unintercepted roar\r\nof waters. When at last this is reached, over a final downward clamber,\r\nthe traveler stands upon a sandy rift confronted by nearly vertical\r\nwalls many hundred feet high, at whose base a black torrent pitches in a\r\ngiddying onward slide that gives him momentarily the sensation of\r\nslipping into an abyss.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: A Party on Bright Angel Trail.]\r\n\r\nWith so little labor may one come to the Colorado River in the heart of\r\nits most tremendous channel, and gaze upon a sight that heretofore has\r\nhad fewer witnesses than have the wilds of Africa. Dwarfed by such\r\nprodigious mountain shores, which rise immediately from the water at an\r\nangle that would deny footing to a mountain sheep, it is not easy to\r\nestimate confidently the width and volume of the river. Choked by the\r\nstubborn granite at this point, its width is probably between 250 and\r\n300 feet, its velocity fifteen miles an hour, and its volume and turmoil\r\nequal to the Whirlpool Rapids of Niagara. Its rise in time of heavy rain\r\nis rapid and appalling, for the walls shed almost instantly all the\r\nwater that falls upon them. Drift is lodged in the crevices thirty feet\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nFor only a few hundred yards is the tortuous stream visible, but its\r\neffect upon the senses is perhaps the greater for that reason. Issuing\r\nas from a mountain side, it slides with oily smoothness for a space and\r\nsuddenly breaks into violent waves that comb back against the current\r\nand shoot unexpectedly here and there, while the volume sways tide-like\r\nfrom side to side, and long curling breakers form and hold their outline\r\nlengthwise of the shore, despite the seemingly irresistible velocity of\r\nthe water. The river is laden with drift (huge tree trunks), which it\r\ntosses like chips in its terrible play.\r\n\r\nStanding upon that shore one can barely credit Powell’s achievement, in\r\nspite of its absolute authenticity. Never was a more magnificent\r\nself-reliance displayed than by the man who not only undertook the\r\npassage of Colorado River but won his way. And after viewing a fraction\r\nof the scene at close range, one can not hold it to the discredit of\r\nthree of his companions that they abandoned the undertaking not far\r\nbelow this point. The fact that those who persisted got through alive is\r\nhardly more astonishing than that any should have had the hardihood to\r\npersist. For it could not have been alone the privation, the infinite\r\ntoil, the unending suspense in constant menace of death that assaulted\r\ntheir courage; these they had looked for; it was rather the unlifted\r\ngloom of those tartarean depths, the unspeakable horrors of an endless\r\nvalley of the shadow of death, in which every step was irrevocable.\r\n\r\nReturning to the spot where the animals were abandoned, camp is made for\r\nthe night. Next morning the way is retraced. Not the most fervid\r\npictures of a poet’s fancy could transcend the glories then revealed in\r\nthe depths of the canyon; inky shadows, pale gildings of lofty spires,\r\ngolden splendors of sun beating full on façades of red and yellow,\r\nobscurations of distant peaks by veils of transient shower, glimpses of\r\nwhite towers half drowned in purple haze, suffusions of rosy light\r\nblended in reflection from a hundred tinted walls. Caught up to exalted\r\nemotional heights the beholder becomes unmindful of fatigue. He mounts\r\non wings. He drives the chariot of the sun.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Uncaptioned vista]\r\n\r\nHaving returned to the plateau, it will be found that the descent into\r\nthe canyon has bestowed a sense of intimacy that almost amounts to a\r\nmental grasp of the scene. The terrific deeps that part the walls of\r\nhundreds of castles and turrets of mountainous bulk may be approximately\r\nlocated in barely discernible pen-strokes of detail, and will be\r\napprehended mainly through the memory of upward looks from the bottom,\r\nwhile towers and obstructions and yawning fissures that were deemed\r\nevents of the trail will be wholly indistinguishable, although they are\r\nknown to lie somewhere flat beneath the eye. The comparative\r\ninsignificance of what are termed grand sights in other parts of the\r\nworld is now clearly revealed. Twenty Yosemites might lie unperceived\r\nanywhere below. Niagara, that Mecca of marvel seekers, would not here\r\npossess the dignity of a trout stream. Your companion, standing at a\r\nshort distance on the verge, is an insect to the eye.\r\n\r\nStill, such particulars can not long hold the attention, for the\r\npanorama is the real overmastering charm. It is never twice the same.\r\nAlthough you think you have spelt out every temple and peak and\r\nescarpment, as the angle of sunlight changes there begins a ghostly\r\nadvance of colossal forms from the farther side, and what you had taken\r\nto be the ultimate wall is seen to be made up of still other isolated\r\nsculptures, revealed now for the first time by silhouetting shadows. The\r\nscene incessantly changes, flushing and fading, advancing into\r\ncrystalline clearness, retiring into slumberous haze.\r\n\r\nShould it chance to have rained heavily in the night, next morning the\r\ncanyon is completely filled with fog. As the sun mounts, the curtain of\r\nmist suddenly breaks into cloud fleeces, and while you gaze these\r\nfleeces rise and dissipate, leaving the canyon bare. At once around the\r\nbases of the lowest cliffs white puffs begin to appear, creating a scene\r\nof unparalleled beauty as their dazzling cumuli swell and rise and their\r\nnumber multiplies, until once more they overflow the rim, and it is as\r\nif you stood on some land’s end looking down upon a formless void. Then\r\nquickly comes the complete dissipation, and again the marshaling in the\r\ndepths, the upward advance, the total suffusion and the speedy\r\nvanishing, repeated over and over until the warm walls have expelled\r\ntheir saturation.\r\n\r\nLong may the visitor loiter upon the verge, powerless to shake loose\r\nfrom the charm, tirelessly intent upon the silent transformations until\r\nthe sun is low in the west. Then the canyon sinks into mysterious purple\r\nshadow, the far Shinumo Altar is tipped with a golden ray, and against a\r\nleaden horizon the long line of the Echo Cliffs reflects a soft\r\nbrilliance of indescribable beauty, a light that, elsewhere, surely\r\nnever was on sea or land. Then darkness falls, and should there be a\r\nmoon, the scene in part revives in silver light, a thousand spectral\r\nforms projected from inscrutable gloom; dreams of mountains, as in their\r\nsleep they brood on things eternal.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Uncaptioned vista]\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Uncaptioned vista]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLORER\r\n                            BY J. W. POWELL\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The Ives and Wheeler Expeditions\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1857 Lieutenant Ives, of the engineer corps of the army,\r\nascended the Colorado River on a trip of exploration with a little\r\nsteamer called the Explorer; he went as far as the mouth of the Rio\r\nVirgin. Falling back down river a few miles, Lieutenant Ives met a pack\r\ntrain which had followed him up the bank of the stream. Here he\r\ndisembarked, and on the 24th of March started with a land party to\r\nexplore the eastern bank of the river; making a long detour he ascended\r\nthe plateau through which the Grand Canyon is cut, and in an adventurous\r\njourney he obtained views of the canyon along its lower course. On this\r\ntrip J. S. Newberry was the geologist, and to him we are indebted for\r\nthe first geological explanation of the canyon and the description of\r\nthe high plateau through which it is formed. Doctor Newberry was not\r\nonly an able geologist, but he was also a graphic writer, and his\r\ndescription of the canyon as far as it was seen by him is a classic in\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Lieutenant Wheeler was sent out by the chief engineer of the\r\narmy to explore the Grand Canyon from below. In the spring he succeeded\r\nin reaching the mouth of Diamond Creek, which had previously been seen\r\nby Doctor Newberry in 1858. Mr. Gilbert was the geologist of this\r\nexpedition, and his studies of the canyon region during this and\r\nsubsequent years have added greatly to our knowledge of this land of\r\nwonders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Major Powell’s Several Trips\r\n\r\nIn this same year I essayed to explore the Grand Canyon of the Colorado,\r\ntogether with the upper canyons of that stream and the great canyons of\r\nthe lower portion of Green River. For this purpose I employed four\r\nrowboats and made the descent from what is now Green River station\r\nthrough the whole course of canyons to the mouth of the Rio Virgin, a\r\ndistance of more than a thousand miles.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: From Kaibab Plateau, Looking South.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1870 I again started with three boats and descended the\r\nriver to the Crossing of the Fathers, where I met a pack train and went\r\nout with a party of men to explore ways down into the Grand Canyon from\r\nthe north, and devoted the summer, fall, winter, and following spring to\r\nthis undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1871 I returned to the rowboats and descended through\r\nMarble Canyon to the Grand Canyon of Arizona, and then through the\r\ngreater part of the Grand Canyon itself. Subsequent years were then\r\ngiven to exploration of the country adjacent to the Grand Canyon. On\r\nthese trips Mr. Gilbert, the geologist, who had been with Lieutenant\r\nWheeler, and Capt. C. E. Dutton, were my geological companions. On the\r\nsecond boat trip, and during all the subsequent years of exploration in\r\nthis region, Prof. A. H. Thompson was my geographical companion,\r\nassisted by a number of topographical engineers.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Mr. C. D. Walcott, as my assistant in the United States\r\nGeological Survey, went with me into the depths of the Grand Canyon. We\r\ndescended from the summit of the Kaibab Plateau on the north by a trail\r\nwhich we built down a side canyon in a direction toward the mouth of the\r\nLittle Colorado River. The descent was made in the fall, and a small\r\nparty of men was left with Mr. Walcott in this region of stupendous\r\ndepths to make a study of the geology of an important region of\r\nlabyrinthian gorges. Here, with his party, he was shut up for the\r\nwinter, for it was known when we left him that snows on the summit of\r\nthe plateau would prevent his return to the upper region before the sun\r\nshould melt them the next spring. Mr. Walcott is now the Director of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nAfter this year I made no substantial additions to my geologic and\r\nscenic knowledge of the Grand Canyon, though I afterward studied the\r\narchæology to the south and east throughout a wide region of ruined\r\npueblos and cliff dwellings.\r\n\r\nSince my first trip in boats many others have essayed to follow me, and\r\nyear by year such expeditions have met with disaster; some hardy\r\nadventurers are buried on the banks of the Green, and the graves of\r\nothers are scattered at intervals along the course of the Colorado.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the brave F. M. Brown lost his life. But finally a party of\r\nrailroad engineers, led by R. B. Stanton, started at the head of Marble\r\nCanyon and made their way down the river as they extended a survey for a\r\nrailroad along its course.\r\n\r\nOther adventurous travelers have visited portions of the Grand Canyon\r\nregion, and Mr. G. Wharton James has extended his travels widely over\r\nthe region in the interest of popular science and the new literature\r\ncreated in the last decades of the nineteenth century. And now I once\r\nmore return to a reminiscent account of the Grand Canyon, for old men\r\nlove to talk of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Plateau Region\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon of Arizona and the Marble Canyon constitute one great\r\ngorge carved by a mighty river through a high plateau. On the northeast\r\nand north a line of cliffs face this plateau by a bold escarpment of\r\nrock. Climb these cliffs and you must ascend from 800 to 1,000 feet, but\r\non their summit you will stand upon a plateau stretching away to the\r\nnorth. Now turn to face the south and you will overlook the cliff and\r\nwhat appears to be a valley below. From the foot of the cliff the\r\ncountry rises to the south to a great plateau through which the Marble\r\nand the Grand canyons are carved. This plateau terminates abruptly on\r\nthe west by the Grand Wash Cliffs, which is a high escarpment caused by\r\na “fault” (as the geologist calls it), that is, the strata of sandstone\r\nand limestone are broken off, and to the west of the fracture they are\r\ndropped down several thousand feet, so that standing upon the edge of\r\nthe plateau above the Grand Wash Cliffs you may look off to the west\r\nover a vast region of desert from which low volcanic mountains rise that\r\nseem like purple mounds in sand-clad lands.\r\n\r\nOn the east the great plateau breaks down in a very irregular way into\r\nthe valley of the Little Colorado, and where the railroad ascends the\r\nplateau from the east it passes over picturesque canyons that run down\r\ninto the Little Colorado. On the south the plateau is merged into the\r\ngreat system of mountains that stand in Southern Arizona. Where the\r\nplateau ends and the mountains begin is not a well-defined line. The\r\nplateau through which the Grand Canyon is cut is a region of great\r\nscenic interest. Its surface is from six to more than eight thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. The Grand Plateau is composed of many\r\nsubsidiary plateaus, each one having its own peculiar and interesting\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nThe Kaibab Plateau, to the northeast of the Grand Canyon, is covered\r\nwith a pine forest which is intercepted by a few meadows with here and\r\nthere a pond or lakelet. It is the home of deer and bear.\r\n\r\nTo the west is the Shinumo Plateau in which the Shinumo Canyon is\r\ncarved; and on the cliffs of this canyon and in the narrow valley along\r\nits course the Shinumo ruins are found—the relics of a prehistoric race.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Shinumo Plateau is the Kanab Plateau, with ruins\r\nscattered over it, and on its northern border the beautiful Mormon town\r\nof Kanab is found, and the canyon of Kanab Creek separates the Shinumo\r\nPlateau from the Kanab Plateau. It begins as a shallow gorge and\r\ngradually increases in depth until it reaches the Colorado River itself,\r\nat a depth of more than 4,000 feet below the surface. Vast amphitheaters\r\nare found in its walls and titanic pinnacles rise from its depths. One\r\nChristmas day I waded up this creek. It was one of the most delightful\r\nwalks of my life, from a land of flowers to a land of snow.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Kanab Plateau are the Uinkaret Mountains—an immense\r\ngroup of volcanic cones upon a plateau. Some of these cones stand very\r\nnear the brink of the Grand Canyon and from one of them a flood of\r\nbasalt was poured into the canyon itself. Not long ago geologically, but\r\nrather long when reckoned in years of human history, this flood of lava\r\nrolled down the canyon for more than _fifty miles_, filling it to the\r\ndepth of _two_ or _three hundred feet_ and diverting the course of the\r\nriver against one or the other of its banks. Many of the cones are of\r\nred cinder, while sometimes the lava is piled up into huge mountains\r\nwhich are covered with forest. To the west of the Uinkaret Mountains\r\nspreads the great Shiwits Plateau, crowned by Mount Dellenbough.\r\n\r\nPast the south end of these plateaus runs the Colorado River; southward\r\nthrough Marble Canyon and in the Grand Canyon, then northwestward past\r\nthe Kaibab and Shinumo Canyon, then southwestward past the Kanab\r\nPlateau, Uinkaret Mountains to the southernmost point of the Shiwits\r\nPlateau, and then northwestward to the Grand Wash Cliffs. Its distance\r\nin this course is little more than 300 miles—but the 300 miles of river\r\nare set on every side with cliffs, buttes, towers, pinnacles,\r\namphitheaters, caves, and terraces, exquisitely storm-carved and painted\r\nin an endless variety of colors.\r\n\r\nThe plateau to the south of the Grand Canyon, which we need not describe\r\nin parts, is largely covered with a gigantic forest. There are many\r\nvolcanic mountains and many treeless valleys. In the high forest there\r\nare beautiful glades with little stretches of meadow which are spread in\r\nsummer with a parterre of flowers of many colors. This upper region is\r\nthe garden of the world. When I was first there bear, deer, antelope,\r\nand wild turkeys abounded, but now they are becoming scarce. Widely\r\nscattered throughout the plateau are small canyons, each one a few miles\r\nin length and a few hundred feet in depth. Throughout their course\r\ncliff-dweller ruins are found. In the highland glades and along the\r\nvalley, pueblo ruins are widely scattered, but the strangest sights of\r\nall the things due to prehistoric man are the cave dwellings that are\r\ndug in the tops of cinder cones and the villages that were built in the\r\ncaves of volcanic cliffs. If now I have succeeded in creating a picture\r\nof the plateau I will attempt a brief description of the canyon.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Copyright, 1899, by H. G. Peabody.\r\n                   Bissell Point and Colorado River.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Marble Canyon\r\n\r\nAbove the Paria the great river runs down a canyon which it has cut\r\nthrough one plateau. On its way it flows with comparative quiet through\r\nbeautiful scenery, with glens that are vast amphitheaters which often\r\noverhang great springs and ponds of water deeply embosomed in the\r\ncliffs. From the southern escarpment of this plateau the great Colorado\r\nPlateau rises by a comparatively gentle acclivity, and Marble Canyon\r\nstarts with walls but a few score feet in height until they reach an\r\naltitude of about 5,000 feet. On the way the channel is cut into beds of\r\nrock of lower geologic horizon, or greater geologic age. These rocks are\r\nsandstones and limestones. Some beds are very hard, others are soft and\r\nfriable. The friable rocks wash out and the harder rocks remain\r\nprojecting from the walls, so that every wall presents a set of stony\r\nshelves. These shelves rise along the wall toward the south as new\r\nshelves set in from below.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this shelving structure the walls are terraced and the\r\ncliffs of the canyon are set back one upon the other. Then these canyon\r\nwalls are interrupted by side streams which themselves have carved\r\nlateral canyons, some small, others large, but all deep. In these side\r\ngorges the scenery is varied and picturesque; deep clefts are seen here\r\nand there as you descend the river—clefts furnished with little streams\r\nalong which mosses and other plants grow. At low water the floor of the\r\ngreat canyon is more or less exposed, and where it flows over limestone\r\nrocks beautiful marbles are seen in many colors; saffron, pink, and blue\r\nprevail. Sometimes a façade or wall appears rising vertically from the\r\nwater for thousands of feet. At last the canyon abruptly ends in a\r\nconfusion of hills beyond which rise towering cliffs, and the group of\r\nhills are nestled in the bottom of a valley-like region which is\r\nsurrounded by cliffs more than a mile in altitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The Grand Canyon\r\n\r\nFrom here on for many miles the whole character of the canyon changes.\r\nFirst a dike appears; this is a wall of black basalt crossing the river;\r\nit is of lava thrust up from below through a huge crevice broken in the\r\nrock by earthquake agency. On the east the Little Colorado comes; here\r\nit is a river of salt water, and it derives its salt a few miles up the\r\nstream. The main Colorado flows along the eastern and southern wall.\r\nClimbing this for a few hundred feet you may look off toward the\r\nnorthwest and gaze at the cliffs of the Kaibab Plateau.\r\n\r\nThis is the point where we built a trail down a side canyon where Mr.\r\nWalcott was to make his winter residence and study of the region; it is\r\nvery complicated and exhibits a vast series of unconformable rocks of\r\nhigh antiquity. These lower rocks are of many colors; in large part they\r\nare shales. The region, which appears to be composed of bright-colored\r\nhills washed naked by the rain, is, in fact, beset with a multitude of\r\nwinding canyons with their own precipitous walls. It is a region of many\r\ncanyons in the depths of the Grand Canyon itself.\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful region Mr. Walcott, reading the book of geology, lived\r\nin a summerland during all of a long winter while the cliffs above were\r\ncovered with snow which prevented his egress to the world. His\r\ncompanions, three young Mormons, longing for a higher degree of\r\ncivilization, gazed wistfully at the snow-clad barriers by which they\r\nwere inclosed. One was a draughtsman, another a herder of his stock, and\r\nthe third his cook. They afterward told me that it was a long winter of\r\nhomesickness, and that months dragged away as years, but Mr. Walcott\r\nhimself had the great book of geology to read, and to him it was a\r\nwinter of delight.\r\n\r\nA half dozen miles below the basaltic wall the river enters a channel\r\ncarved in 800 or 1,000 feet of dark gneiss of very hard rock. Here the\r\nchannel is narrow and very swift and beset with rapids and falls. On the\r\nsouth and southwest the wall rises abruptly from the water to the summit\r\nof the plateau for about 6,000 feet, but across the river on the north\r\nand west mountains of gneiss and quartzites appear, sometimes rising to\r\nthe height of a thousand feet. These are mountains in the bottom of a\r\ncanyon. The buttes and plateaus of the inter-canyon region are composed\r\nof shales, sandstones, and limestones, which give rise to vast\r\narchitectural shelving and to pinnacles and towers of gigantic\r\nproportions, the whole embossed with a marvelously minute system of\r\nfretwork carved by the artistic clouds. Looking beyond these mountains,\r\nbuttes, and plateaus vistas of the walls of the great plateau are seen.\r\nFrom these walls project salients, and deep re-entrant angles appear.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene is forever reminding you of mighty architectural\r\npinnacles and towers and balustrades and arches and columns with lattice\r\nwork and delicate carving. All of these architectural features are\r\nsublime by titanic painting in varied hues—pink, red, brown, lavender,\r\ngray, blue, and black. In some lights the saffron prevails, in other\r\nlights vermilion, and yet in other lights the grays and blacks\r\npredominate. At times, and perhaps in rare seasons, clouds and cloudlets\r\nform in the canyon below and wander among the side canyons and float\r\nhigher and higher until they are dissolved in the upper air, or perhaps\r\nthey accumulate to hide great portions of the landscape. Then through\r\nrifts in the clouds vistas of Wonderland are seen. Such is that portion\r\nof the canyon around the great south bend of the Colorado River past the\r\npoint of the Kaibab Plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        As Seen by the Geologist\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter of my book entitled “The Canyons of the Colorado” I\r\nhave described the Grand Canyon in the following terms:\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon is a gorge 217 miles in length, through which flows a\r\ngreat river with many storm-born tributaries. It has a winding way, as\r\nrivers are wont to have. Its banks are vast structures of adamant, piled\r\nup in forms rarely seen in the mountains.\r\n\r\nDown by the river the walls are composed of black gneiss, slates, and\r\nschists, all greatly implicated and traversed by dikes of granite. Let\r\nthis formation be called the black gneiss. It is usually about 800 feet\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\nThen over the black gneiss are found 800 feet of quartzites, usually in\r\nvery thin beds of many colors, but exceedingly hard, and ringing under\r\nthe hammer like phonolite. These beds are dipping and unconformable with\r\nthe rocks above. While they make but 800 feet of the wall or less they\r\nhave a geologic thickness of 12,000 feet. Set up a row of books aslant;\r\nit is ten inches from the shelf to the top of the line of books, but\r\nthere may be three feet of the books measured directly through the\r\nleaves. So these quartzites are aslant, and though of great geologic\r\nthickness they make but 800 feet of the wall. Your books may have\r\nmany-colored bindings and differ greatly in their contents; so these\r\nquartzites vary greatly from place to place along the wall, and in many\r\nplaces they entirely disappear. Let us call this formation the\r\nvariegated quartzite.\r\n\r\nAbove the quartzites there are 500 feet of sandstones. They are of a\r\ngreenish hue, but are mottled with spots of brown and black by iron\r\nstains. They usually stand in a bold cliff, weathered in alcoves. Let\r\nthis formation be called the cliff sandstone.\r\n\r\nAbove the cliff sandstone there are 700 feet of bedded sandstones and\r\nlimestones, which are massive sometimes and sometimes broken into thin\r\nstrata. These rocks are often weathered in deep alcoves. Let this\r\nformation be called the alcove sandstone.\r\n\r\nOver the alcove sandstone there are 1,600 feet of limestone, in many\r\nplaces a beautiful marble, as in Marble Canyon. As it appears along the\r\nGrand Canyon it is always stained a brilliant red, for immediately over\r\nit there are thin seams of iron, and the storms have painted these\r\nlimestones with pigments from above. Altogether this is the red-wall\r\ngroup. It is chiefly limestone. Let it be called the red-wall limestone.\r\n\r\nAbove the red wall there are 800 feet of gray and bright red sandstone,\r\nalternating in beds that look like vast ribbons of landscape. Let it be\r\ncalled the banded sandstone.\r\n\r\nAnd over all, at the top of the wall, is the Aubrey limestone, 1,000\r\nfeet in thickness. This Aubrey has much gypsum in it, great beds of\r\nalabaster that are pure white in comparison with the great body of\r\nlimestone below. In the same limestone there are enormous beds of chert,\r\nagates, and carnelians. This limestone is especially remarkable for its\r\npinnacles and towers. Let it be called the tower limestone.\r\n\r\nThese are the elements with which the walls are constructed, from black\r\nbuttress below to alabaster tower above. All of these elements weather\r\nin different forms and are painted in different colors, so that the wall\r\npresents a highly complex façade. A wall of homogeneous granite, like\r\nthat in the Yosemite, is but a naked wall, whether it be 1,000 or 5,000\r\nfeet high. Hundreds and thousands of feet mean nothing to the eye when\r\nthey stand in a meaningless front. A mountain covered by pure snow\r\n10,000 feet high has but little more effect on the imagination than a\r\nmountain of snow 1,000 feet high—it is but more of the same thing—but a\r\nfaçade of seven systems of rock has its sublimity multiplied sevenfold.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: A Panoramic View of the Canyon.]\r\n\r\nConsider next the horizontal elements of the Grand Canyon. The river\r\nmeanders in great curves, which are themselves broken into curves of\r\nsmaller magnitude. The streams that head far back in the plateau on\r\neither side come down in gorges and break the wall into sections. Each\r\nlateral canyon has a secondary system of laterals, and the secondary\r\ncanyons are broken by tertiary canyons; so the crags are forever\r\nbranching, like the limbs of an oak. That which has been described as a\r\nwall is such only in its grand effect. In detail it is a series of\r\nstructures separated by a ramification of canyons, each having its own\r\nwalls. Thus, in passing down the canyon it seems to be inclosed by\r\nwalls, but oftener by salients—towering structures that stand between\r\ncanyons that run back into the plateau. Sometimes gorges of the second\r\nor third order have met before reaching the brink of the Grand Canyon,\r\nand then great salients are cut off from the wall and stand out as\r\nbuttes—huge pavilions in the architecture of the canyon. The scenic\r\nelements thus described are fused and combined in very different ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Its Length\r\n\r\nWe measured the length of the Grand Canyon by the length of the river\r\nrunning through it, but the running extent of wall can not be measured\r\nin this manner. In the black gneiss, which is at the bottom, the wall\r\nmay stand above the river for a few hundred yards or a mile or two; then\r\nto follow the foot of the wall you must pass into a lateral canyon for a\r\nlong distance, perhaps miles, and then back again on the other side of\r\nthe lateral canyon; then along by the river until another lateral canyon\r\nis reached, which must be headed in the black gneiss. So for a dozen\r\nmiles of river through the gneiss there may be a hundred miles of wall\r\non either side. Climbing to the summit of the black gneiss and following\r\nthe wall in the variegated quartzite, it is found to be stretched out to\r\na still greater length, for it is cut with more lateral gorges. In like\r\nmanner there is yet greater length of the mottled (or alcove) sandstone\r\nwall, and the red wall is still farther stretched out in ever-branching\r\ngorges.\r\n\r\nTo make the distance for ten miles along the river by walking along the\r\ntop of the red wall it would be necessary to travel several hundred\r\nmiles. The length of the wall reaches its maximum in the banded\r\nsandstone, which is terraced more than any of the other formations. The\r\ntower limestone wall is less tortuous. To start at the head of the Grand\r\nCanyon on one of the terraces of the banded sandstone and follow it to\r\nthe foot of the Grand Canyon, which by river is a distance of 217 miles,\r\nit would be necessary to travel many thousand miles by the winding way;\r\nthat is, the banded wall is many thousand miles in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     As Seen Traveling Down Stream\r\n\r\nFor eight or ten miles below the mouth of the Little Colorado, the river\r\nis in the variegated quartzites, and a wonderful fretwork of forms and\r\ncolors, peculiar to this rock, stretches back for miles to a labyrinth\r\nof the red-wall cliff; then below, the black gneiss is entered and soon\r\nhas reached an altitude of 800 feet and sometimes more than 1,000 feet,\r\nand upon this black gneiss all the other structures in their wonderful\r\ncolors are lifted. These continue for about seventy miles, when the\r\nblack gneiss below is lost, for the walls are dropped down by the West\r\nKaibab Fault and the river flows in the quartzites.\r\n\r\nThen for eighty miles the mottled (or alcove) sandstones are found in\r\nthe river bed. The course of the canyon is a little south of west and is\r\ncomparatively straight. At the top of the red-wall limestone there is a\r\nbroad terrace, two or three miles in width, composed of hills of\r\nwonderful forms carved in the banded beds, and back of this is seen a\r\ncliff in the tower limestone. Along the lower course of this stretch the\r\nwhole character of the canyon is changed by another set of complicating\r\nconditions. We have now reached a region of volcanic activity. After the\r\ncanyons were cut nearly to their present depth, lavas poured out and\r\nvolcanoes were built on the walls of the canyon, but not in the canyon\r\nitself, though at places rivers of molten rock rolled down the walls\r\ninto the Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe canyon for the next eighty miles is a compound of that found where\r\nthe river is in the black gneiss and that found where the dead volcanoes\r\nstand on the brink of the wall. In the first stretch, where the gneiss\r\nis at the foundation, we have a great bend to the south, and in the last\r\nstretch, where the gneiss is below and the dead volcanoes above, another\r\ngreat southern detour is found. These two great beds are separated by\r\neighty miles of comparatively straight river.\r\n\r\nLet us call this first great bend the Kaibab reach of the canyon, and\r\nthe straight part the Kanab reach, for the Kanab Creek heads far off in\r\nthe plateau to the north and joins the Colorado at the beginning of the\r\nmiddle stretch. The third great southern bend is the Shiwits stretch.\r\nThus there are three distinct portions of the Grand Canyon: The Kaibab\r\nsection, characterized more by its buttes and salients; the Kanab\r\nsection, characterized by its comparatively straight walls with\r\nvolcanoes on the brink, and the Shiwits section, which is broken into\r\ngreat terraces with gneiss at the bottom and volcanoes at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Work of Erosion\r\n\r\nThe erosion represented in the canyons, although vast, is but a small\r\npart of the great erosion of the region, for between the cliffs blocks\r\nhave been carried away far superior in magnitude to those necessary to\r\nfill the canyons. Probably there is no portion of the whole region from\r\nwhich there have not been more than a thousand feet degraded, and there\r\nare districts from which more than 30,000 feet of rock have been carried\r\naway; altogether there is a district of country more than 200,000 square\r\nmiles in extent, from which, on the average, more than 6,000 feet have\r\nbeen eroded. Consider a rock 200,000 square miles in extent and a mile\r\nin thickness, against which the clouds have hurled their storms, and\r\nbeat it into sands, and the rills have carried the sands into the\r\ncreeks, and the creeks have carried them into the rivers, and the\r\nColorado has carried them into the sea.\r\n\r\nWe think of the mountains as forming clouds about their brows, but the\r\nclouds have formed the mountains. Great continental blocks are upheaved\r\nfrom beneath the sea by internal geologic forces that fashion the earth.\r\nThen the wandering clouds, the tempest-bearing clouds, the\r\nrainbow-decked clouds, with mighty power and with wonderful skill, carve\r\nout valleys and canyons and fashion hills and cliffs and mountains. The\r\nclouds are the artists sublime.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Winter and Cloud Effects\r\n\r\nIn winter some of the characteristics of the Grand Canyon are\r\nemphasized. The black gneiss below, the variegated quartzite, and the\r\ngreen or alcove sandstone form the foundation for the mighty red wall.\r\nThe banded sandstone entablature is crowned by the tower limestone. In\r\nwinter this is covered with snow. Seen from below, these changing\r\nelements seem to graduate into the heavens, and no plane of demarcation\r\nbetween wall and blue firmament can be seen. The heavens constitute a\r\nportion of the façade and mount into a vast dome from wall to wall,\r\nspanning the Grand Canyon with empyrean blue. So the earth and the\r\nheavens are blended in one vast structure.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Copyright, 1899, by H. G. Peabody.\r\n             The Lower Gorge, Foot of Bright Angel Trail.]\r\n\r\nWhen the clouds play in the canyon, as they often do in the rainy\r\nseason, another set of effects is produced. Clouds creep out of canyons\r\nand wind into other canyons. The heavens seem to be alive, not moving as\r\nmove the heavens over a plain, in one direction with the wind, but\r\nfollowing the multiplied courses of these gorges. In this manner the\r\nlittle clouds seem to be individualized, to have wills and souls of\r\ntheir own and to be going on diverse errands—a vast assemblage of\r\nself-willed clouds faring here and there, intent upon purposes hidden in\r\ntheir own breasts. In imagination the clouds belong to the sky, and when\r\nthey are in the canyon the skies come down into the gorges and cling to\r\nthe cliffs and lift them up to immeasurable heights, for the sky must\r\nstill be far away. Thus they lend infinity to the walls.\r\n\r\nYou can not see the Grand Canyon in one view as if it were a changeless\r\nspectacle from which a curtain might be lifted, but to see it you have\r\nto toil from month to month through its labyrinths. It is a region more\r\ndifficult to traverse than the Alps or the Himalayas, but if strength\r\nand courage are sufficient for the task, by a year’s toil a concept of\r\nsublimity can be obtained never again to be equaled on the hither side\r\nof paradise.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Copyright, 1899, by H.

LUMMIS\r\n\r\n\r\n“The greatest thing in the world.” That is a large phrase and an\r\nover-worked one, and hardened travelers do not take it lightly upon the\r\ntongue. Noticeably it is most glibly in use with those but lately, and\r\nfor the first time, wandered beyond their native state or county, and as\r\nevery province has its own local brag of biggest things, the too\r\ncredulous tourist will find a superlative everywhere. And superlatives\r\nare unsafe without wide horizons of comparison.\r\n\r\nYet in every sort there is, of course, somewhere “the biggest thing in\r\nthe world” of its kind. It is a good word, when spoken in season and not\r\nabused in careless ignorance.\r\n\r\nI believe there is and can be no dispute that the term applies literally\r\nto several things in the immediate region of the Grand Canyon of\r\nArizona. As I have more than once written (and it never yet has been\r\ncontroverted), probably no other equal area on earth contains so many\r\nsupreme marvels of so many kinds—so many astounding sights, so many\r\nmasterpieces of Nature’s handiwork, so vast and conclusive an\r\nencyclopedia of the world-building processes, so impressive monuments of\r\nprehistoric man, so many triumphs of man still in the tribal relation—as\r\nwhat I have called the Southwestern Wonderland. This includes a large\r\npart of New Mexico and Arizona, the area which geographically and\r\nethnographically we may count as the Grand Canyon region. Let me mention\r\na few wonders:\r\n\r\nThe largest and by far the most beautiful of all petrified forests, with\r\nseveral hundred square miles whose surface is carpeted with agate chips\r\nand dotted with agate trunks two to four feet in diameter; and just\r\nacross one valley a buried “forest” whose huge silicified—not\r\nagatized—logs show their ends under fifty feet of sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe largest natural bridge in the world—200 feet high, over 500 feet\r\nspan, and over 600 feet wide, up and down stream, and with an orchard on\r\nits top and miles of stalactite caves under its abutments.\r\n\r\nThe largest variety and display of geologically recent volcanic action\r\nin North America; with 60-mile lava flows, 1,500-foot blankets of creamy\r\ntufa cut by scores of canyons; hundreds of craters and thousands of\r\nsquare miles of lava beds, basalt, and cinders, and so much “volcanic\r\nglass” (obsidian) that it was the chief tool of the prehistoric\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe largest and the most impressive villages of cave-dwellings in the\r\nworld, most of them already abandoned “when the world-seeking Genoese”\r\nsailed.\r\n\r\nThe peerless and many-storied cliff-dwellings—castles and forts and\r\nhomes in the face of wild precipices or upon their tops—an aboriginal\r\narchitecture as remarkable as any in any land.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-six strange communal town republics of the descendants of the\r\n“cliff-dwellers,” the modern Pueblos; some in fertile valleys, some\r\n(like Acoma and Moki) perched on barren and dizzy cliff tops. The\r\nstrange dances, rites, dress, and customs of this ancient people who had\r\nsolved the problem of irrigation, 6-story house building, and clean\r\nself-government, and even women’s rights—long before Columbus was born.\r\n\r\nThe noblest Caucasian ruins in America, north of Mexico—the great stone\r\nand adobe churches reared by Franciscan missionaries, near three\r\ncenturies ago, a thousand miles from the ocean, in the heart of the\r\nSouthwest.\r\n\r\nSome of the most notable tribes of savage nomads—like the Navajos, whose\r\nblankets and silver work are pre-eminent, and the Apaches, who, man for\r\nman, have been probably the most successful warriors in history.\r\n\r\nAll these, and a great deal more, make the Southwest a wonderland\r\nwithout a parallel. There are ruins as striking as the storied ones\r\nalong the Rhine, and far more remarkable. There are peoples as\r\npicturesque as any in the Orient, and as romantic as the Aztecs and the\r\nIncas of whom we have learned such gilded fables, and there are natural\r\nwonders which have no peers whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Of the Canyon, and Other Wonders\r\n\r\nAt the head of the list stands the Grand Canyon of the Colorado; whether\r\nit is the “greatest wonder of the world” depends a little on our\r\ndefinition of “wonder.” Possibly it is no more wonderful than the fact\r\nthat so tiny a fraction of the people who confess themselves the\r\nsmartest in the world have ever seen it. As a people we dodder abroad to\r\nsee scenery incomparably inferior.\r\n\r\nBut beyond peradventure it is the greatest chasm in the world, and the\r\nmost superb. Enough globe-trotters have seen it to establish that fact.\r\nMany have come cynically prepared to be disappointed; to find it\r\noverdrawn and really not so stupendous as something else. It is, after\r\nall, a hard test that so be-bragged a wonder must endure under the\r\ncritical scrutiny of them that have seen the earth and the fullness\r\nthereof. But I never knew the most self-satisfied veteran traveler to be\r\ndisappointed in the Grand Canyon, or to patronize it. On the contrary,\r\nthis is the very class of men who can best comprehend it, and I have\r\nseen them fairly break down in its awful presence.\r\n\r\nI do not know the Himalayas except by photograph and the testimony of\r\nmen who have explored and climbed them, and who found the Grand Canyon\r\nan absolutely new experience. But I know the American continents pretty\r\nwell, and have tramped their mountains, including the Andes—the next\r\nhighest mountains in the world, after half a dozen of the Himalayas—and\r\nof all the famous quebradas of the Andes there is not one that would\r\ncount 5 per cent on the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. For all their\r\n25,000-foot peaks, their blue-white glaciers, imminent above the bald\r\nplateau, and green little bolsones (“pocket valleys”) of Chile, Peru,\r\nBolivia, and Ecuador; for all their tremendous active volcanoes, like\r\nSaugay and Cotopaxi; for all an earthquake activity beside which the\r\n“shake” at Charleston was mere paper-doll play; for all the steepest\r\ngradients in the world (and Peru is the only place in the world where a\r\nriver falls 17,000 feet in 100 miles)—in all that marvelous 3,000-mile\r\nprocession of giantism there is not one canyon which any sane person\r\nwould for an instant compare with that titanic gash that the Colorado\r\nhas chiseled through a comparatively flat upland. Nor is there anything\r\nremotely approaching it in all the New World. So much I can say at first\r\nhand. As for the Old World, the explorer who shall find a gorge there\r\none-half as great will win undying fame.\r\n\r\nThe quebrada of the Apu-Rimac is a marvel of the Andes, with its\r\nvertiginous depths and its suspension bridge of wild vines. The Grand\r\nCanyon of the Arkansas, in Colorado, is a noble little slit in the\r\nmountains. The Franconia and White Mountain notches in New Hampshire are\r\nbeautiful. The Yosemite and the Yellowstone canyons surpass the world,\r\neach in its way. But if all of these were hung up on the opposite wall\r\nof the Grand Canyon from you the chances are fifty to one that you could\r\nnot tell t’other from which, nor any of them from the hundreds of other\r\ncanyons which rib that vast vertebrate gorge. If the falls of Niagara\r\nwere installed in the Grand Canyon between your visits and you knew it\r\nby the newspapers—next time you stood on that dizzy rimrock you would\r\nprobably need good field-glasses and much patience before you could\r\nlocate that cataract which in its place looks pretty big. If Mount\r\nWashington were plucked up bodily by the roots—not from where you see\r\nit, but from sea-level—and carefully set down in the Grand Canyon, you\r\nprobably would not notice it next morning, unless its dull colors\r\ndistinguished it in that innumerable congress of larger and painted\r\ngiants.\r\n\r\nAll this, which is literally true, is a mere trifle of what might be\r\nsaid in trying to fix a standard of comparison for the Grand Canyon. But\r\nI fancy there is no standard adjustable to the human mind. You may\r\ncompare all you will—eloquently and from wide experience, and at last\r\nall similes fail. The Grand Canyon is just the Grand Canyon, and that is\r\nall you can say. I never have seen anyone who was prepared for it. I\r\nnever have seen anyone who could grasp it in a week’s hard exploration;\r\nnor anyone, except some rare Philistine, who could even think he had\r\ngrasped it. I have seen people rave over it; better people struck dumb\r\nwith it, even strong men who cried over it; but I have never yet seen\r\nthe man or woman that _expected_ it.\r\n\r\nIt adds seriously to the scientific wonder and the universal\r\nimpressiveness of this unparalleled chasm that it is not in some\r\nstupendous mountain range, but in a vast, arid, lofty floor of nearly\r\n100,000 square miles—as it were, a crack in the upper story of the\r\ncontinent. There is no preparation for it. Unless you had been told, you\r\nwould no more dream that out yonder amid the pines the flat earth is\r\nslashed to its very bowels, than you would expect to find an iceberg in\r\nBroadway. With a very ordinary running jump from the spot where you get\r\nyour first glimpse of the canyon you could go down 2,000 feet without\r\ntouching. It is sudden as a well.\r\n\r\nBut it is no mere cleft. It is a terrific trough 6,000 to 7,000 feet\r\ndeep, ten to twenty miles wide, hundreds of miles long, peopled with\r\nhundreds of peaks taller than any mountain east of the Rockies, yet not\r\none of them with its head so high as your feet, and all ablaze with such\r\ncolor as no eastern or European landscape ever knew, even in the\r\nAlpen-glow. And as you sit upon the brink the divine scene-shifters give\r\nyou a new canyon every hour. With each degree of the sun’s course the\r\ngreat countersunk mountains we have been watching fade away, and new\r\nones, as terrific, are carved by the westering shadows. It is like a\r\ndissection of the whole cosmogony. And the purple shadows, the dazzling\r\nlights, the thunderstorms and snowstorms, the clouds and the rainbows\r\nthat shift and drift in that vast subterranean arena below your feet!\r\nAnd amid those enchanted towers and castles which the vastness of the\r\nscale leads you to call “rocks,” but which are in fact as big above the\r\nriver-bed as the Rockies from Denver, and bigger than Mount Washington\r\nfrom Fabyan’s or the Glen!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon country is not only the hugest, but the most varied and\r\ninstructive example on earth of one of the chief factors of\r\nearth-building—erosion. It is the mesa country—the Land of Tables.\r\nNowhere else on the footstool is there such an example of deep-gnawing\r\nwater or of water high-carving. The sandstone mesas of the Southwest,\r\nthe terracing of canyon walls, the castellation, battlementing, and\r\ncliff-making, the cutting down of a whole landscape except its\r\nprecipitous islands of flat-topped rock, the thin lava table-cloths on\r\ntables 100 feet high—these are a few of the things which make the\r\nSouthwest wonderful alike to the scientist and the mere sight-seer.\r\n\r\nThat the canyon is not “too hard” is perhaps sufficiently indicated by\r\nthe fact that I have taken thither ladies and children and men in their\r\nseventies, when the easiest way to get there was by a 70-mile stage\r\nride, and that at six years old my little girl walked all the way from\r\nrim to bottom of canyon and came back on a horse the same day, and was\r\nnext morning ready to go on a long tramp along the rim.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Copyright, 1899, by H. G. Peabody.\r\n               The North Wall from Grand Scenic Divide.]\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Uncaptioned vista]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        INFORMATION FOR TOURISTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Preliminary\r\n\r\nThere is only one way by which to directly reach the Grand Canyon of\r\nArizona, and that is via the Santa Fe (The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe\r\nRailway System).\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of reaching the Canyon from the Santa Fe—rail from\r\nWilliams, private conveyance from Flagstaff and Peach Springs.\r\n\r\nThe route from Flagstaff is not available in winter. The Peach Springs\r\nroute is open in winter, but now little used. The bulk of the travel is\r\nvia Williams, sixty-five miles north to Bright Angel—open all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Three Gateways\r\n\r\nThere are but three points from which an easy descent may be made of the\r\nsouth wall to the granite gorge of the Grand Canyon:\r\n\r\n1. At Grand View, down Berry’s (Grand View) or Hance’s (Red Canyon)\r\ntrails.\r\n\r\n2. At Bright Angel, down Bright Angel Trail.\r\n\r\n3. At Bass’ Camp, down Mystic Spring Trail.\r\n\r\nWhile the canyon may be reached over trails at other places outside of\r\nthe district named (such as Lee’s Ferry Trail, by wagon from Winslow;\r\nMoki Indian Trail, by way of Little Colorado Canyon; and Diamond Creek\r\nroad to Colorado River from Peach Springs station), most tourists prefer\r\nthe Bright Angel, Grand View, and Bass’ Camp routes, because of the\r\nsuperior facilities and views there offered. The Peach Springs route is\r\nthe only other one now used by the public to any extent.\r\n\r\nIt is near Grand View that Marble Canyon ends and the Grand Canyon\r\nproper begins. Northward, a few miles away, is the mouth of the Little\r\nColorado Canyon. Here the granite gorge is first seen.\r\n\r\nBright Angel is approximately in the center, and Bass’ Camp at the\r\nwestern end of the granite gorge. By wagon road it is eighteen miles\r\nfrom Bright Angel east to Grand View, and twenty-three miles west to\r\nBass’ Camp.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the Grand Canyon at Grand View is accounted most\r\nsublime—a scene of wide outlooks and brilliant hues; at Bright Angel,\r\ndeepest and most impressive—a scene that awakens the profoundest\r\nemotions; at Bass’ Camp, the most varied—a scene of striking contrasts\r\nin form and color.\r\n\r\nEach locality has its special charm. All three should be visited, if\r\ntime permits, as only by long observation can one gain even a\r\nsuperficial knowledge of what the Grand Canyon is. To know it intimately\r\nrequires a longer stay and more careful study.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Ride from Williams\r\n\r\nBecause of recent improvements in service the Grand Canyon of Arizona\r\nmay now be visited, either in summer or winter, with reasonable comfort\r\nand without any hardship. No one need be deterred by fear of inclement\r\nweather or a tedious stage ride. The trip is entirely feasible for the\r\naverage traveler every day in the year.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Santa Fe transcontinental train at Williams, Arizona,\r\npassengers change in same depot to a local train of the Grand Canyon\r\nRailway, which leaves Williams daily, and arrives at destination after a\r\nthree hours’ run.\r\n\r\nWilliams is a busy town of 1,500 inhabitants, 378 miles west of\r\nAlbuquerque, on the Santa Fe. Here are located large sawmills, smelters,\r\nnumerous well-stocked stores, and railroad division buildings. Prior to\r\nthe disastrous fire in July, 1901, there were several excellent hotels.\r\nThe one not destroyed affords good accommodations; it has been recently\r\nenlarged and otherwise improved.\r\n\r\nThere is usually ample time at Williams, between trains, for the ascent\r\nof Bill Williams Mountain, which rises near the town to a height of\r\n9,000 feet. Tourists will find the trip thoroughly enjoyable. It can be\r\nmade in five hours on horseback in perfect safety. The trail is an easy\r\none, first leading through a gently sloping path of pines, then steeply\r\nup to the wind-swept summit alongside a pretty stream bordered by\r\nthickets of quaking aspens. Chimney Rock, with its eagle’s nest, is a\r\nnoteworthy rock formation. On the summit is buried the historic pioneer\r\nscout, Bill Williams. From his resting-place there is a wide outlook,\r\nembracing, on clear days, the wall of the Grand Canyon, Verde River,\r\nChino Valley, Jerome, Hell Canyon, Seligman, Ash Fork, and many\r\nneighboring peaks.\r\n\r\nThe railroad track to the canyon is remarkably smooth for a new line. It\r\nis built across a slightly rolling mesa, in places thickly wooded, in\r\nothers open. The snow-covered San Francisco Peaks are on the eastern\r\nhorizon. Kendricks, Sitgreaves, and Williams mountains are also visible.\r\nRed Butte, thirty miles distant, is a prominent local landmark. Before\r\nthe terminus is reached the train climbs a long, high ridge and enters\r\nCoconino Forest, which resembles a natural park. The route here is amid\r\nfragrant pines, over low hills, and along occasional gulches and\r\n“washes.” Taken under the favorable conditions which generally prevail\r\nat this high altitude, the journey is a novelty and a delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             At Destination\r\n\r\nThe hotel at head of Bright Angel Trail is reached early in the evening.\r\nThe tourist then finds himself on the verge of a high precipice, from\r\nwhich is obtained by moonlight a magnificent view of the opposite wall\r\nand of the intervening crags, towers, and slopes. The suddenness, the\r\nsurprise, the revelation come as a fitting climax to a unique trip.\r\nAfter nightfall the air becomes cold, for here you are 7,000 feet above\r\nthe sea; yet the absence of humidity, peculiar to these high altitudes,\r\nmakes the chill less penetrating than on lower levels. By day, in the\r\nsunshine, there is usually a genial warmth—then overcoats, gloves, and\r\nwraps are laid aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Bright Angel Hotel\r\n\r\nThe Bright Angel Hotel is managed by Mr. M. Buggeln, who also controls\r\nthe stage line, trail stock, guides, etc. The hotel comprises a\r\ncombination log and frame structure of eight rooms, with three frame\r\nannexes containing forty-six sleeping rooms, and (for summer use)\r\nseveral rows of tents, all clustered on the rim and surrounded by pines\r\nand spruces. Each room in the annexes has one or two beds, a stove,\r\ndressing table, and Navajo rugs. In the log-cabin part of the main\r\nedifice are two large rooms. One is used for reception purposes, being\r\nwarmed by means of an old-fashioned fireplace and tastefully carpeted\r\nwith Indian rugs, also furnished with capacious rocking chairs and a\r\npiano; the other of these two rooms is for the office.\r\n\r\nGood meals are prepared by expert cooks and served in a pleasant\r\ndining-room. In a word, the hotel facilities are good, far better than\r\none might expect to find for the reasonable rate charged. There is no\r\n“roughing it”; everything is homelike and comfortable. One must not,\r\nhowever, expect all the city luxuries. A telephone and telegraph line\r\ndirectly connects the hotel with the outer world at Williams.\r\n\r\n  Note.—A fine modern hotel of fifty rooms, with cottage annexes, to be\r\n  known as Bright Angel Tavern, will be built in this vicinity during\r\n  1903 and managed by Mr. Fred Harvey. It will be a permanent affair and\r\n  will provide all the latest conveniences.\r\n\r\nWhile one ought to remain at least a week, a stop-over of three days\r\nfrom the transcontinental trip will allow practically two days at the\r\ncanyon. One full day should be devoted to an excursion down Bright Angel\r\nTrail, and the other to walks and drives along the rim. Another day on\r\nthe rim—making a four-days’ stop-over in all—will enable visitors to get\r\nmore satisfactory views of this stupendous wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Down Bright Angel Trail\r\n\r\nThe trail here is perfectly safe and is generally open the year round.\r\nIn midwinter it is liable to be closed for a few days at the top by\r\nsnow, but such blockade is only temporary. It reaches from the hotel\r\nfour miles to the top of the granite wall immediately overlooking the\r\nColorado River. At this point the river is 1,200 feet below, while the\r\nhotel on the rim is 4,300 feet above. The trip is commonly made on\r\nhorseback, accompanied by a guide; charges for trail stock and services\r\nof guide are moderate. A strong person, accustomed to mountain climbing,\r\ncan make the round trip on foot in one day, by starting early enough;\r\nbut the average traveler will soon discover that a horse is a necessity,\r\nespecially for the upward climb.\r\n\r\nEight hours are required for going down and coming back, allowing two\r\nhours for lunch, rest, and sight-seeing. Those wishing to reach the\r\nriver leave the main trail at Indian Garden Spring and follow the\r\ndownward course of Willow and Pipe creeks. Owing to the abrupt descent\r\nfrom this point, part of the side trail must be traversed on foot.\r\nProvision is made for those wishing to camp out at night on the river’s\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nThe famous guide, John Hance, is now located at Bright Angel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             What to Bring\r\n\r\nIf much tramping is done, stout, thick shoes should be provided. Ladies\r\nwill find that short walking skirts are a convenience; divided skirts\r\nare preferable, but not essential, for the horseback journey down the\r\nzigzag trail. Traveling caps and (in summer) broad-brimmed straw hats\r\nare useful toilet adjuncts. Otherwise ordinary clothing will suffice. A\r\ngood field glass and camera should be brought along.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Bright Angel Hotel.]\r\n\r\nThe round-trip ticket rate, Williams to Grand Canyon and return, is only\r\n$6.50. Adding $6 for two days’ stay at Canyon Hotel, $1 for part of a\r\nday at hotel in Williams, $1.50 for probable proportion of cost of\r\nguide, $3 for trail stock, and the total necessary expense of the three\r\ndays’ stop-over is about $18 for one person; each additional day only\r\nadds $3 to the cost for hotel.\r\n\r\nStop-overs will be granted at Williams on railroad and Pullman tickets\r\nif advance application is made to train and Pullman conductors. Trunks\r\nmay be stored in the station at Williams free of charge by arrangement\r\nwith ticket agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Grand View\r\n\r\nGrand View (previously mentioned) may be reached in summer by private\r\nconveyance from Flagstaff, a distance of seventy-five miles; or at any\r\ntime of the year by stage from Bright Angel, sixteen miles along the\r\nrim. The rate for round trip, Bright Angel to Grand View, is $2.50 to $5\r\neach person, according to size of party. While Flagstaff is an\r\ninteresting place to visit—with its near-by cliff and cave dwellings and\r\nSan Francisco Peaks—and the trip thence to the Grand Canyon is a novel\r\none, distance and time are such that most travelers prefer to go in by\r\nrailroad from Williams.\r\n\r\nGrand View Hotel is a large, rustic structure, built near the head of\r\nBerry’s Trail and about three miles from Hance’s Trail, in the midst of\r\ntall pines and overlooking the mighty bend of the Colorado. This is the\r\npoint to which visitors were conducted in the days of the old stage line\r\nfrom Flagstaff.\r\n\r\nIt is noted for its wide views of the Coconino Forest and Painted\r\nDesert, as well as for the beautiful forms and color of the canyon\r\nitself. A favorite trip here is to go down one trail and up the other.\r\nThe hotel accommodations are quite good; capacity, forty guests; rate,\r\n$3 per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Bass’ Camp\r\n\r\nAt the western end of the granite gorge is Mystic Spring Trail, an easy\r\nroute down to the Colorado River and up the other side to Dutton’s Point\r\nand Powell’s Plateau. The magnificent panorama eastward from Havasupai\r\nPoint takes in fifty miles of the canyon, while westward is the unique,\r\ntable-like formation which characterizes the lower reaches of the river.\r\nThe views from both rims are pronounced by noted artists and explorers\r\nto be unequaled.\r\n\r\nPresent accommodations at Havasupai Hotel (Bass’ Camp), near head of\r\nthis trail, are fairly good, consisting of a cabin, several tents, and\r\ngood trail stock; wholesome meals are served in comfortable style. A new\r\nhotel is to be built here during 1903. Bass’ Camp is now reached by\r\nstage from Coconino, a station on the Grand Canyon Railway, or one may\r\ntake a team direct from Bright Angel.\r\n\r\nA visit should be made to the Havasupai Indian village in Cataract\r\nCanyon. Any bona fide tourist can procure an introductory letter from\r\nthe railroad agent at Williams or Grand Canyon. On presenting same to\r\nthe U. S. Indian agent at Supai, permission will be granted to enter the\r\nreservation. This is an unique trip of about forty miles, first by wagon\r\nacross a timbered plateau, then on horseback down precipitous Topocobya\r\nTrail, along the rocky floors of Topocobya and Cataract canyons, deep in\r\nthe earth, to a place of gushing springs, green fields, and enchanting\r\nwaterfalls. Here live the Havasupai Indians, one of the most interesting\r\ntribes in Arizona. The round trip from Bright Angel or Bass’ Camp is\r\nmade in three or four days at an expense of $35 to $50 each for a party\r\nof three persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Peach Springs Route\r\n\r\nThe trip in winter from Peach Springs station down to the Colorado\r\nRiver, through Diamond Creek Canyon, is most enjoyable. Owing to the low\r\naltitude here (4,780 feet at Peach Springs and approximately 2,000 feet\r\nat the river) the air is usually balmy from November to April; in summer\r\nthe heat is a considerable drawback.\r\n\r\nA journey of but twelve miles leads you through a miniature Grand Canyon\r\nwith scenery increasingly sublime. On either side are abrupt walls and\r\nwonderfully suggestive formations—castles, domes, minarets. On your\r\nleft, glancing backward, is an exact reproduction of Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThis comparatively easy jaunt brings you by team to the very brink of\r\nthe swift-rolling Colorado, whereas by the other Grand Canyon gateways\r\nyou are landed on the rim and must go down thousands of feet by a steep\r\ntrail. The outlook here is restricted to the river itself and the great\r\nwalls rising precipitously from its banks—a scene well worth while, but\r\nnot so impressive as the wide sweep of the canyon visible from the rim.\r\n\r\nFollowing Diamond Creek to its source you may walk along the bed of the\r\nstream between walls thousands of feet high and glistening in the white\r\nsunlight as if varnished. The upper part of Diamond Creek is a veritable\r\nterrace of fern bowers, luxuriant vegetation, crystal cascades, and\r\nsequestered meadow parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Flagstaff and Vicinity\r\n\r\nThe town itself is an interesting place, prettily situated in the heart\r\nof the San Francisco uplift and surrounded by a pine forest.\r\n\r\nIts hotels, business houses, lumber mills, and residences denote thrift.\r\nOn a neighboring hill is the Lowell Observatory, noted for its many\r\ncontributions to astronomical science.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: San Francisco Peaks.]\r\n\r\nEight miles southwest from Flagstaff—reached by a pleasant drive along a\r\nlevel road through tall pines—is Walnut Canyon, a rent in the earth\r\nseveral hundred feet deep and three miles long, with steep terraced\r\nwalls of limestone. Along the shelving terraces, under beetling\r\nprojections of the strata, are scores of quaint cliff dwellings, the\r\nmost famous group of its kind in this region. The larger abodes are\r\ndivided into several compartments by cemented walls, many parts of which\r\nare still intact. It is believed that these cliff dwellers were of the\r\nsame stock as the Pueblo Indians of to-day and that they lived here\r\nabout 800 years ago.\r\n\r\nNine miles from Flagstaff and only half a mile from the old stage road\r\nto the Grand Canyon, upon the summit of an extinct crater, the\r\nremarkable ruins of the cave-dwellers may be seen.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent San Francisco Peaks, visible from every part of the\r\ncountry within a radius of a hundred miles, lie just north of Flagstaff.\r\nThere are three peaks which form one mountain. From Flagstaff a road has\r\nbeen constructed up Humphrey’s Peak, whose summit is 12,750 feet above\r\nsea level. It is a good mountain road, and the entire distance from\r\nFlagstaff is only about ten miles. The trip to the summit and back is\r\neasily made in one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Announcement\r\n\r\nThe Santa Fe has published a new and beautiful book on the Grand Canyon.\r\nIt contains articles by Hamlin Garland, Harriet Monroe, Robert Brewster\r\nStanton, Chas.

Ewing, and Thomas\r\nMoran, as well as the authors represented in this pamphlet. The book has\r\nmore than a hundred pages, illustrated with half-tones and portraits;\r\nthe cover is from a painting of the Canyon by Thomas Moran, and is\r\nlithographed in seven colors. It will be forwarded on receipt of fifty\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nA beautiful and unique color picture of the Grand Canyon, mounted to\r\nshow all its colors as in nature, may be had for twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\n                          Address W.
