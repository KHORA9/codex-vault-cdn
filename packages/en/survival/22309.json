It was written\r\nto be used as a content in giving a knowledge of the beginning and\r\ndevelopment of human progress. The aim is not just to furnish an\r\ninteresting narrative, but one that is true to the course of human\r\ndevelopment and the scientific and geographical facts of the island on\r\nwhich Robinson is supposed to have lived.\r\n\r\nThe excuse for departing so widely from the original story is to be\r\nfound in the use which was desired to be made of it. The story here\r\npresented is simply the free adaptation of the original narrative to the\r\ndemand for a specific kind of content in a form which would be\r\ninteresting to the children.\r\n\r\nThe teacher is and should be justified in using with entire freedom any\r\nmaterial accessible for the ends of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe text as here given has been published with an introduction and\r\nsuggestive treatments as a Teacher's Manual for Primary Grades--\"The\r\nTeacher's Robinson Crusoe.\" Explicit directions and ample suggestions\r\nare made for the use of the story as material for instruction in all the\r\nlanguage arts, drawing, social history, and the manual arts.\r\n\r\nPublished by the Educational Publishing Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    AN AMERICAN\r\n    ROBINSON CRUSOE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nROBINSON WITH HIS PARENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere once lived in the city of New York, a boy by the name of Robinson\r\nCrusoe. He had a pleasant home. His father and mother were kind to him\r\nand sent him to school. They hoped that he would study hard and grow up\r\nto be a wise and useful man, but he loved rather to run idle about the\r\nstreet than to go to school. He was fond of playing along the River\r\nHudson, for he there saw the great ships come and go. They were as big\r\nas houses. He watched them load and unload their cargoes and hundreds of\r\npeople get off and on. His father had told him that the ships came from\r\nfar distant lands, where lived many large animals and black men. His\r\nfather told him too, that in these faraway countries the nuts on the\r\ntrees grew to be as large as one's head and that the tree were as high\r\nas church steeples.\r\n\r\nWhen Robinson saw the ships put out to sea he would watch them till they\r\nwould disappear below the horizon far out in the ocean, and think, \"Oh,\r\nif I could only go with them far away to see those strange countries!\"\r\nThus he would linger along the great river and wish he might find an\r\nopportunity of making a voyage. Often it would be dark before he would\r\nget home. When he came into the house his mother would meet him and say\r\nin a gentle voice, \"Why, Robinson, how late you are in getting home! You\r\nhave been to the river again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON WATCHING THE SHIPS]\r\n\r\nThen Robinson would hang his head and feel deeply ashamed, and when his\r\nfather, who was a merchant, came home from the store, his mother would\r\ntell him that Robinson had again been truant.\r\n\r\nThis would grieve his father deeply and he would go to the boy's bedside\r\nand talk earnestly with him. \"Why do you do so?\" he would say. \"How\r\noften have I told you to go to school every day?\" This would for a time\r\nwin Robinson back to school, but by the next week it had been forgotten\r\nand he would again be loitering along the river in spite of his father's\r\nremonstrances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS AN APPRENTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way one year after another slipped by. Robinson was not more\r\ndiligent. He was now almost sixteen years old and had not learned\r\nanything. Then came his birthday. In the afternoon his father called him\r\ninto his room. Robinson opened the door softly. There sat his father\r\nwith a sad face. He looked up and said, \"Well, Robinson, all your\r\nschoolmates have long been busy trying to learn something, so that they\r\nmay be able to earn their own living. Paul will be a baker, Robert a\r\nbutcher, Martin is learning to be a carpenter, Herman a tailor, Otto a\r\nblacksmith, Fritz is going to high school, because he is going to be a\r\nteacher. Now, you are still doing nothing. This will not do. From this\r\ntime on I wish you to think of becoming a merchant. In the morning you\r\nwill go with me to the store and begin work. If you are attentive and\r\nskillful, when the time comes you can take up my business and carry it\r\non. But if you remain careless and continue to idle about, no one will\r\never want you and you must starve because you will never be able to earn\r\na living.\"\r\n\r\nSo the next morning Robinson went to the store and began work. He\r\nwrapped up sugar and coffee, he weighed out rice and beans. He sold meal\r\nand salt, and when the dray wagon pulled up at the store, loaded with\r\nnew goods, he sprang out quickly and helped to unload it. He carried in\r\nsacks of flour and chests of tea, and rolled in barrels of coffee and\r\nmolasses. He also worked some at the desk. He looked into the account\r\nbooks and saw in neat writing, \"Goods received\" and \"Goods sold.\" He\r\nnoticed how his father wrote letters and reckoned up his accounts. He\r\neven took his pen in hand and put the addresses on the letters and\r\npackages as well as he could.\r\n\r\nBut soon he was back in his careless habits. He was no longer attentive\r\nto business. He wrapped up salt instead of sugar. He put false weights\r\non the scales. He gave some too much and others too little. His hands,\r\nonly, were in the business, his mind was far away on the ocean with the\r\nships. When he helped unload the wagons, he would often let the chests\r\nand casks drop, so that they were broken and their contents would run\r\nout on the ground. For he was always thinking, \"Where have these casks\r\ncome from and how beautiful it must be there!\" And many times packages\r\ncame back because Robinson had written the name of the place or the\r\ncountry wrong. For when he was writing the address, he was always\r\nthinking, \"You will be laid upon a wagon and will then go into the\r\nship.\" One day he had to write a letter to a man far over the sea. He\r\ncould stand it no longer. His father had gone out. He threw down the\r\npen, picked up his hat and ran out to the Hudson to see the ships, and\r\nfrom that time on he spent more time loitering along the river than he\r\ndid in the store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S DEPARTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson's father soon noticed that his son was no longer attending to\r\nhis work, and one morning sent for him to come to his office. When\r\nRobinson came in his father arose from his chair and looked him long and\r\nearnestly in the face. Then he said, \"I am very sorry, Robinson, that\r\nyou seem determined to continue your evil ways. If you do not do better\r\nyou will grow up to be a beggar or worse.\" Robinson cast his eyes down\r\nand said, \"I do not want to be a merchant, I would rather sail in a ship\r\naround the world.\" His father answered, \"If you do not know anything you\r\ncannot be of use on a ship, and no one will want you. In a strange land\r\nyou cannot live without working. If you run away from your parents you\r\nwill come to be sorry for it.\" Robinson wept, for he saw that his father\r\nwas right, and he promised to obey.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three weeks, Robinson went to his mother and said,\r\n\"Mother, won't you go to father and tell him that if he will only let me\r\ntake one voyage and it proves to be unpleasant, I will come back to the\r\nstore and work hard?\" But the mother cried. With tears in her eyes, she\r\nsaid: \"Robinson, your brothers are both dead. You are the only child\r\nleft to us and if you go away, we shall be entirely alone. How easy it\r\nwould be to be drowned in the sea, or torn to pieces by wild animals\r\naway there in a foreign country. Both your father and myself are getting\r\nalong in years and who will take care of us when we are sick? Do not\r\ncause us the grief we must suffer if you go away so far amid so many\r\ndangers. I cannot bear to have you speak of it again.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson did not speak of it again, but he did not forget it. He was\r\nnineteen years old. It was one day in August that Robinson stood at the\r\nwharf looking longingly after the departing ships. As he stood there,\r\nsomeone touched him on the shoulder. It was a ship captain's son. He\r\npointed to a long ship and said, \"My father sails to-day in that ship\r\nfor Africa and takes me with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I could only go with you!\" cried Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"Do come along,\" cried his comrade.\r\n\r\n\"But I have no money,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't make any difference,\" returned the captain's son. \"We will\r\ntake you anyway.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson, without thinking for a moment, gave his friend his hand and\r\npromised to go with him.\r\n\r\nSo without saying \"Good-bye\" to his parents, Robinson went immediately\r\non board the ship with his friend. This happened on the 10th of August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON AND THE CAPTAIN'S SON]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nROBINSON FAR FROM HOME\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S VOYAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce on board, Robinson watched the preparations for departure. At\r\ncommand the sailors clambered up into the rigging and loosened the\r\nsails. Then the captain from his bridge called out, \"Hoist the anchor!\"\r\nThen the great iron hooks that held the ship fast were lifted up, a\r\ncannon sounded a final farewell. Robinson stood on the deck. He saw the\r\ngreat city shimmer in the sunshine before him. Very fast now the land\r\nwas being left behind. It was not long until all that could be seen of\r\nhis native city was the tops of the highest towers. Then all faded from\r\nsight. Behind, in front, right and left, he saw nothing but waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe became a little afraid. At noon there arose a strong wind and the\r\nship rocked to and fro. He became dizzy and had to hold fast to\r\nsomething. The masts and rigging began to dance. It seemed to him as if\r\nall was turning around. Suddenly he fell full length on the deck and it\r\nwas impossible for him to get up. He was seasick. He wailed and cried,\r\nbut no one heard him, no one helped him. Then he thought of his home,\r\nhis parents whom he had so ungratefully left.\r\n\r\nHe had been on the water about two weeks when one day as he lay in his\r\nroom, Robinson heard people over his head running about and crying, \"A\r\nstorm is coming!\" The ship's sides trembled and creaked. The ship was\r\ntossed like a nutshell. Now it rolled to the right, now to the left. And\r\nRobinson was thrown from one side to the other. Every moment he expected\r\nthe ship to sink. He turned pale and trembled with fear. \"Ah, if I were\r\nonly at home with my parents, safe on the land,\" he said. \"If I ever get\r\nsafe out of this, I will go home as quickly as I can and stay with my\r\ndear parents!\" The storm raged the whole day and the whole night. But on\r\nthe next morning the wind went down and the sea was calm. By evening the\r\nsky was clear and Robinson was again cheerful. He ran about the ship. He\r\nlooked at the glittering stars and was contented and happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE SHIPWRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks went by. Robinson had long ago forgotten his resolutions\r\nto return home. It was very hot. The glowing sun beat down upon the\r\nship. The wide surface of the sea glistened. No breeze stirred. The\r\nsails hung loose on the top of the mast. But far away on the shore could\r\nbe seen a black bank of clouds.\r\n\r\nAll at once the ship was thrown violently to one side by a fierce gust\r\nof wind. Robinson threw himself on the deck. The sea began to rise and\r\nfall. The waves were as high as mountains. Now the ship was borne aloft\r\nto the skies, and now it would seem that it must be overwhelmed in the\r\nsea. When it sank down between the great waves of water, Robinson\r\nthought it would never again rise. The waves beat violently on the\r\nship's side. Robinson went down the steps into his little room, but he\r\ncame back full of anxiety. He believed every minute he would meet death\r\nin the waves. The night at last came on. The lightning flashed. The\r\nstorm howled. The ship trembled. The water roared. So the night wore on.\r\nThe storm raged for six days. Then on the seventh day it was somewhat\r\nabated. But the hope was soon dashed. The storm had abated but to get\r\nnew strength. Suddenly it bore down with frightful power on the doomed\r\nvessel, struck it, and shot it like an arrow through the water. Then\r\nRobinson felt a fearful crash. The ship groaned as if it would fall into\r\na thousand pieces. It had struck a rock and there held fast. At the same\r\nmoment the sailors raised the cry, \"The ship has sprung a leak!\" The\r\nwater surged into the ship. All called for help. Each one thought only\r\nof himself. There was only one boat. The others had all been torn away.\r\nIt was soon let down into the sea. All sprang in. For a moment the\r\nsailors forgot the waves, but all at once a wave, mountains high, struck\r\nthe boat and swallowed it up. Robinson shut his eyes. The water roared\r\nin his ears. He sank into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nROBINSON SAVED\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was borne down far, far into the ocean. He attempted to work\r\nhimself up, so that he could see light and breathe the air. But again\r\nand again the waves carried him down. Finally a wave threw him up and he\r\nsaw, for a moment, the light of day and got a breath of air, but the\r\nnext instant he was deep under the water. Then another wave bore him on\r\nits crest. He breathed a deep breath and at the same time saw land not\r\nfar away. He bent all his strength toward reaching the land. He got\r\nalmost to it, when a wave caught him and hurled him on a jutting rock.\r\nWith all his strength he seized the rock with both hands and held on.\r\n\r\nPresently he worked himself up a little and at last got a foothold. But,\r\nscarcely had he done so, when his strength left him and he fell on the\r\nground as one dead. But he soon revived. He opened his eyes and looked\r\naround. He saw above him the blue sky, and under him the solid brown\r\nearth, and before him the gray angry sea. He felt to see if he still\r\nbreathed. The storm had destroyed the ship. The waves had overwhelmed\r\nthe boat. The water wished to draw him into the deep. The rocks seemed\r\nto want to hurl him back, but storm and wave and rock had accomplished\r\nnothing. There was One who was stronger than they.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson sank on his knees and folded his hands. Tears came to his\r\neyes. He breathed hard. At last he said, \"Dear Father in Heaven, I live.\r\nThou hast saved me. I thank Thee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST NIGHT ON LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Where are my companions?\" That was his first thought. He began to call\r\nand halloo: \"Where are you? Come here!\" But no one answered. Then he\r\nwished to see if anyone lived on the land, and he cried, \"Is there no\r\none here? Hello!\" but all remained still.\r\n\r\nAll at once he drew himself together and shrank back. He heard a bush\r\nrustle and the thought came like a flash, \"That is a wild animal that\r\nwill pounce upon me and tear my flesh with his teeth and claws. How\r\nshall I save myself? Where shall I fly for safety? Where shall I turn? I\r\nhave nothing but my clothes and my life saved from the water. All that I\r\nhad the waves have swallowed up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then hunger and thirst began to trouble him. He had eaten nothing\r\nthe whole day and the salt water had made him sick.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the night had come on. Robinson was very tired.\r\nEverything was new and strange. He did not know which way to move. He\r\nwas in the greatest terror.\r\n\r\nHe expected to hear the roar of wild beasts from every secluded spot.\r\nLions and tigers and dreadful serpents filled his thoughts. He must find\r\nshelter from them. But where should he pass the night? Not a house, a\r\nhut or a cave was to be seen. He stood a long time hesitating and did\r\nnot know what to do. Finally he thought, \"I will do as the birds do and\r\nget into a tree.\" He very soon found a tree which had such thick\r\nbranches that it would hold him up.\r\n\r\nRobinson climbed up into the tree, made himself as comfortable as\r\npossible, said his prayers, and as he was thoroughly exhausted, he soon\r\nfell asleep. When he awoke the sun was high in the sky. At first he\r\ncould not remember where he was. Then the truth burst upon him. He tried\r\nto move. He was stiff and sore. His flesh was bruised from being thrown\r\nagainst the rocks and beaten by the waves.\r\n\r\nHe was dreadfully thirsty. His mouth and throat were dry and parched\r\nfrom the salt water. His tongue was thick and swollen. He said, \"I must\r\nfind some water to drink or I shall die!\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard work to get down from the tree. His limbs and back ached\r\nfrom sitting in the tree all night. At last he slipped down and fell on\r\nthe ground. He clasped his hands in prayer and thanked God for keeping\r\nhim through the night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen he got up and tried to walk. He was so weak he could not stand.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself down on the ground and began to sob and cry, \"O Lord,\r\ndo not let me die! Do not let me die!\" As he lay there he heard a queer\r\nsound. He listened. It sounded like water running over rocks. He tried\r\nto get to the place from which the sound came. He tried to walk. When he\r\nfell he crawled on his hands and knees. At last the sound was close by.\r\nHe dragged himself up on the rocks. Yes, there was a spring of clear,\r\ncool, sparkling water bubbling up and trickling over the stones.\r\nRobinson was so thirsty he put his face into the water and drank and\r\ndrank.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down, and after a while he drank again and again.\r\n\r\nAfter Robinson had satisfied his thirst and rested awhile, he felt much\r\nbetter. He said, \"I must try to walk and see whether I can find\r\nsomething to eat.\" He found many kinds of fruits and berries all around\r\nhim, but he was afraid to eat them, as they were strange to him and he\r\nfeared they might be poisonous.\r\n\r\nAs he was walking along, all at once he spied a tall plant in the\r\ndistance which had a familiar look. It looked like corn. He said to\r\nhimself, \"I wonder if it can be corn.\" At last he came near enough to\r\nrecognize it. Yes, it was corn. It did not look exactly like the corn\r\nthat he saw at home, but still he knew it would be safe to eat it. He\r\nbroke off an ear and eagerly ate the kernels raw. Oh, how good it was!\r\nRobinson could not remember anything that tasted half so good.\r\n\r\nHe ate as much as he wanted and then filled his pockets with ears of\r\ncorn for his supper. Then he went back to the spring to get another\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON ON AN ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his hunger and thirst were satisfied, Robinson thought he would\r\ntry to find another dwelling place. \"My legs are stiff and sore from\r\nsitting so uncomfortably last night, and there is so much danger of\r\nfalling,\" he said. \"I will climb yonder hill and look around and see on\r\nwhich side the houses are. I will find me a stick to help me on my way.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke a stick from a dry bush and climbed up the steep sides of the\r\nhill. After a half hour's climb he was on top. What a sight met his\r\neyes! There were no houses, no huts to be seen, no smoke arose from the\r\nforest, no field could be seen. Nothing but trees and bush, sand and\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"I am then upon an island alone, without food, without shelter, without\r\nweapons! What will become of me?\" he cried. \"I am a prisoner. The island\r\nis my prison, the waves are the guards which will not allow me to get\r\naway. Will no ship ever come to set me free?\"\r\n\r\nHe stretched his gaze out to the sea till his eyes ached, but he saw no\r\nship.\r\n\r\nRobinson came down and seated himself on a stone and considered what he\r\nshould do. It was not yet noon, yet he feared greatly the next night. \"I\r\nmust find me a better bed,\" was his first clear thought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S SHELTER\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson saw at a little distance what seemed to be a cleft or an\r\nopening in a huge rock. \"If I could only get inside and find room to\r\nstay over night. The rock would protect me from rain, from the wind and\r\nwild animals better than a tree.\"\r\n\r\nHe long sought in vain for a place wide enough to allow him to get into\r\nthe opening in the rock. He was about to give up, when he seized hold of\r\na branch of a thorn tree growing on the side of the rock. He looked\r\ncloser and saw that it grew out of the cleft in the rock. He saw, too,\r\nthat at this point the opening was wider and that he had only to remove\r\nthe tree in order to get in. \"The hole shall be my dwelling,\" he said.\r\n\"I must get the thorn tree out so that I can have room.\"\r\n\r\nThat was easily said. He had neither axe nor saw, nor knife nor spade.\r\nHow could he do it? He had nothing but his hands. He tried to pull it\r\nout by the roots, but in vain. He wasn't strong enough.\r\n\r\n\"I must dig it out,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\nHe scratched with his nails, but the earth was too hard. What should he\r\ndo? He sought a stick with a fork in it and dug in the earth, but it was\r\nslow work. Then he found a clam-shell. He did better with it, but it was\r\nhard work, and Robinson was not used to hard work. The sweat ran down\r\nhis face and he had often to stop and rest in the shade. The sun burned\r\nso hot and the rock so reflected the heat that he was all but overcome.\r\nBut he worked on. When evening came, he would sleep in the tree and next\r\nmorning he would go at it again. On the third day the roots were all\r\nlaid bare.\r\n\r\nBut the roots were fast in the clefts of the rock and he could not\r\nloosen it, try ever so hard. What would he not have given for an axe, or\r\nat least a knife. And yet he had never thought of their value when at\r\nhome. He attempted to cut one root through with his clam-shell, but the\r\nshell crumbled and would not cut the hard wood.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a long time thinking, not knowing what next to do. He made\r\nup his mind that he must have something harder than the shell to cut\r\nwith. Then he tried a stone with a sharp edge, but soon found he needed\r\nanother one, however. He found one. Then he set the sharp one on the\r\nwood and struck it with the heavy one. In this way he slowly cut the\r\nroots in two.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day there was yet left one big root, bigger than any of the\r\nothers. Robinson got up early in the morning. He worked the whole day.\r\nFinally it gave a crack and it, too, was broken.\r\n\r\nRobinson had only now to remove the loose earth inside the cleft. He\r\nfound the opening could be made large and roomy. It was choked up with\r\ndirt. He dug out enough to allow him room enough to make a place to lie\r\ndown. \"In the future,\" he thought, \"I will take out all the dirt and\r\nthen I shall be comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then dark and the moon shone bright in the heavens. Robinson\r\ngathered a heap of dry grass and made himself a safe bed. But as he lay\r\nthere he saw the moonbeams shining into his cave. He sprang up. \"How\r\neasy,\" he thought, \"for wild animals to creep in here upon me.\"\r\n\r\nHe crawled out and looked around. Not far from the cave he saw a large\r\nflat stone. With great trouble he rolled it to the opening of his cave,\r\nbut before this the morning began to dawn. He went inside the shelter,\r\nseized the stone with both hands and rolled it into the opening till it\r\nalmost closed it. \"I have now a closed home. I can again stretch my\r\nlegs. Wind and rain cannot get at me, nor wild animals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nROBINSON MAKES A HAT\r\n\r\n\r\nRefreshed and with renewed strength, Robinson awoke late the next\r\nmorning, but he had a bad headache. The day before the hot tropic sun\r\nhad beat down on his bare head, as he worked at his cave. He was so busy\r\nthat he forgot to go into the shade from time to time in order to shield\r\nhimself from the scorching sunshine. He felt a new need.\r\n\r\n\"I must make me a hat,\" said Robinson to himself. \"But how?\" He had no\r\nstraw, no thread and no needle. He looked around for a long time, but\r\nfound nothing. The sun mounted even higher in the heavens, and shone\r\nhotter and hotter. He went to seek shelter at last in the deep shade of\r\na nearby tall plant.\r\n\r\nAs he stood there he examined the plant more carefully. \"Out of these\r\nleaves,\" he said, \"I might make a hat.\" He climbed up the short stem of\r\nthe plant and saw that it had not only leaves as long as himself, but\r\nbetween the leaves were big bunches of long, thin fruit, as thick as\r\nthree fingers and similar in shape to a cucumber.\r\n\r\nHe plucked the leaves and fruit and was about to eat some of the fruit\r\nwhen he heard near him a light stir as of some animal. He rolled the\r\nleaves and fruit together and hastened back to the cave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BANANA TREE]\r\n\r\nThe bananas, for that is what the fruit proved to be, were sweet and\r\nrefreshing. After he had eaten enough he set immediately about making\r\nhis hat. He broke off a couple of reeds. He bent one into a hoop. But\r\nthe hoop would not hold without thread. Sometimes it was too large and\r\nsometimes too small. But it must fit his head. He pulled up grass and\r\nbound its ends together, but the grass stalks were not strong enough. He\r\nhunted until he found a tree whose inner bark was soft and came out in\r\nlong fibres. He bound his reed with this. This, too, made the hoop soft\r\nso that it did not hurt his head.\r\n\r\nWhen the hoop was ready and fitted to his head he found the banana\r\nleaves could not be used. Their veins ran straight out from the midrib.\r\nThis made them easily torn, and besides, they were too large. They were\r\nnot the best shape. He saw that leaves about a foot long with broad and\r\ntapering points would be best. He saw too, that if the leaves had their\r\nveins running parallel with the midrib they would be stronger. He made\r\nsearch and at length found leaves that seemed made for his purpose. They\r\nwere thick and leathery and tapered from base to apex like a triangle.\r\n\r\nHe now proceeded with his hat-making. He would take a leaf and lay it on\r\nthe ground with the base toward him. Then he laid the hoop on the base\r\nof the leaf, wrapped it around the hoop and fastened it with thorns. He\r\ndid the same with the other leaves. The thorns were his pins. At last\r\nhe pinned the tips of the leaves together at the top and the hat was\r\nready. It looked just like a big cone, but it kept out the heat of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nRobinson now had corn and bananas and when he was thirsty he drank a\r\nhandful of water from the spring. He had been now nine days on the\r\nisland. Every day he looked out on the sea until his eyes ached to see\r\nif he might discover a ship.\r\n\r\nHe could not understand why no ship came his way. \"Who knows how long I\r\nmust wait here?\" said he sorrowfully. Then the thought came to him: \"You\r\nwill not be able to keep track of the days unless you write it down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S CALENDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter of keeping track of time puzzled Robinson very much. It was\r\ngetting more difficult every day to keep it in his memory. He must write\r\ndown the days as they slip by, but where and how? He had neither pen,\r\nink, nor paper. Should he mark every day with a colored stone on the\r\nsmooth side of the huge rock wall within whose clefts he had dug out his\r\ncave? But the rain would wash off the record and then he would lose all\r\nhis bearings. Then he thought of the beach, but there the wind and waves\r\nwould soon also erase it.\r\n\r\nHe thought a long time. \"I must find something,\" he said to himself on\r\nwhich to keep a record. \"I must also know when Sunday is. I must rest\r\none day in the week. Yes, I must find something,\" he said, \"on which to\r\nwrite.\" And finally he found it. He chose two trees standing near each\r\nother and then sought for a small sharp stone, which he could make\r\nstill sharper by striking it on another. When he had got this pen ready\r\nhe cut into the bark of one tree:\r\n\r\n    _Shipwreck, Sunday, 10th of September, 1875._\r\n\r\nHe made seven cuts in a row for the seven days in the week. The first\r\ncut was longer than the others. This was to represent the Sunday. At\r\nsundown every day he made a new cut in the bark.\r\n\r\nThe other tree he called the month tree. On its stem he was to cut a\r\nmark every time his week tree told him a month had passed. But he must\r\nbe careful, for the months were not of equal length. But he remembered\r\nthat his teacher had once said in school that the months could be\r\ncounted on the knuckles and hollows of the hand, in such a way that the\r\nlong and short months could be found easily and he could tell in this\r\nway the number of days in each.\r\n\r\nRobinson worked at enlarging his shelter a little every day. He was\r\nsorely at loss to find something in which to carry the dirt away from\r\nthe entrance, or enough so that it would not choke up the opening. A\r\nlarge clam shell was all he could think of at present. He would carry\r\nthe dirt to the entrance and some distance away, and then throw it.\r\nFortunately the ground sloped away rapidly, so that he needed a kind of\r\nplatform before his door.\r\n\r\nHe was careful to open the cleft at some distance above the large\r\nopening. For the air was damp and impure in the shelter. But with the\r\nopening made high above, fresh air was constantly passing into, and\r\nimpure air out of, his cave. Light, too, was admitted in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nROBINSON MAKES A HUNTING BAG\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed with Robinson's hat-making and his calendar-making\r\nand his watching the sea. Every day his corn and bananas became more\r\ndistasteful to him. And he planned a longer journey about the island to\r\nsee if something new to eat could be found.\r\n\r\nBut he considered that if he went a distance from his cave and found\r\nsomething it would really be of little use to him. \"I could eat my\r\nfill,\" he said, \"but that is all. And by the time I get back to my cave\r\nI will again be hungry. I must find something in which I can gather and\r\ncarry food.\" He found nothing.\r\n\r\n\"The people in New York,\" he said, \"have baskets, or pockets, or bags\r\nmade of coarse cloth. Of them all, I could most easily make the net,\r\nperhaps, of vines. But the little things would fall out of the net. I\r\nwill see whether I can make a net of small meshes.\"\r\n\r\nBut he soon saw that the vines did not give a smooth surface. He\r\nthought for a long while. In his garden at home his father had sometimes\r\nbound up the young trees with the soft inner bark of others. He wondered\r\nif he could use this. He stripped away the outer bark from the tree,\r\nwhich before had yielded him a fibre for his hat, and pulled off the\r\nlong, smooth pieces of the inner bark. He twisted them together. Then he\r\nthought how he could weave the strands together. He looked at his shirt.\r\nA piece was torn off and unravelled. He could see the threads go up and\r\ndown. He saw that some threads go from left to right (woof), others\r\nlengthwise (the warp).\r\n\r\nFrom his study of the woven cloth, Robinson saw he must have a firmer\r\nthread than the strips of bark gave alone. He separated his bark into\r\nlong, thin strips. These he twisted into strands of yarn by rolling\r\nbetween his hands, or on a smooth surface. As he twisted it he wound it\r\non a stick. It was slow, hard work. Of all his work, the making of yarn\r\nof thread gave him the most trouble. He learned to twist it by knotting\r\nthe thread around the spindle or bobbin on which he wound it and\r\ntwirling this in the air. He remembered sadly the old spinning wheel he\r\nhad seen at his grandmother's house.\r\n\r\nHis next care was something to hold the threads while he wove them in\r\nand out. He had never seen a loom.\r\n\r\nAfter long study Robinson set two posts in the ground and these he bound\r\nwith seventy-two strands horizontally under each other. Then he tied in\r\nthe top at the left another thread and wove it in and out through the\r\nseventy-two threads. So he tied seventy-two vertical strands and wove\r\nthem in and out. Thus he had a net three times as long as his foot and\r\nas wide as long. He tied the four corners together. He made a woven\r\nhandle for it and put it on his shoulder like a sack, saying gleefully,\r\n\"This shall be my hunting bag.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S LOOM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON EXPLORES THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Robinson made his hunting bag he was anxious to set off on his\r\njourney of exploring the island. So he arose very early next morning.\r\n\"Before it is hot,\" thought he, \"I will be quite a distance on my\r\njourney.\" He ate a couple of bananas, scooped up a few handfuls of water\r\nfrom the spring, stuck a few ears of corn in his hunting bag, took his\r\nstick in his hand and went forth. As he left his cave the thought struck\r\nhim: \"What if I could not find my cave again? How can I manage so that I\r\ncan come back to it? I will go away in one direction and return the same\r\nway; but suppose I were to lose the way?\"\r\n\r\nThen he noticed his shadow pointing like a great finger from the sea\r\ntoward the land. He could direct himself by that. He kept his shadow in\r\nfront of him. He had noticed, too, that the wind always blew north of\r\nthe point where the sun rose. This helped him. But sometimes the wind\r\ndied down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOANUT PALM TREE]\r\n\r\nHe had to climb over many rocks and pierce many thickets. At each step\r\nhe saw a rich growth of plants, stems, leaves, flowers, but nothing to\r\neat, no fruits, or nuts. At length he came to a tree as high as a small\r\nchurch steeple. Then he thought of what his father had once said about\r\nthe trees in strange countries. \"Many are as tall as a church steeple\r\nand the nuts are as big as one's head.\" He looked again. Yes, there\r\nthey hung among the leaves, concealed high above in the crown! But so\r\nhigh, it was well that Robinson had learned to climb while on board the\r\nship. He quickly laid down his hunting bag and clambered up the smooth\r\nstem of the high tree, a palm. He picked off a nut and threw it down and\r\nthen several more, and climbed down again.\r\n\r\nBut the nuts were very hard. How should he open them? He had brought\r\nalong his sharp stone with which he had stripped off the inner bark.\r\nWith this he forced off the thick outer shell. But now came the hard nut\r\nwithin, and how hard it was! Striking it was of no use.\r\n\r\nThen he threw a great stone on the nut. The shell was crushed and a\r\nsnow-white kernel lay before him. It tasted like almond. With\r\nastonishment Robinson saw in the middle of the nut a large empty space\r\nwhich must have been filled with fluid as the inside was wet. He wished\r\nthat he had the juice to drink, for he was very thirsty. With this in\r\nview, he examined another and riper nut, and the outside came off more\r\neasily. But how could he break it and at the same time save the juice?\r\nHe studied the hull of the cocoanut on all sides. At the ends were three\r\nlittle hollows. He attempted first to bore in with his fingers, but he\r\ncould not. \"Hold!\" he cried. \"Maybe I can cut them there with the point\r\nof my stone knife.\" This was done without trouble and out of the hole\r\nflowed the sweet, white juice.\r\n\r\nRobinson put a couple of nuts in his hunting bag, and also the shells\r\nfrom the broken nuts. \"Now,\" he thought, \"I shall no longer have to\r\ndrink from my hand.\" With this thought he went on his way.\r\n\r\nAs Robinson came to a rock in his path, out jumped what Robinson took to\r\nbe a rabbit. He ran after him to catch him, but the rabbit was much the\r\nswifter. So Robinson hastened home, but before he reached it the stars\r\nwere shining with their lustrous light. Tired Robinson stretched his\r\nlimbs on his bed of grass and leaves and slept soundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS A HUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the time Robinson was confined to the cave he kept thinking about\r\nthe rabbit he had seen and how he might catch one. Finally, he\r\ndetermined to make a spear. He broke down a thin, young sapling,\r\nstripped off its branches and in one end fastened a sharp stone. He then\r\nwent to bed, for he wanted to be up early for his first hunting trip on\r\nthe morrow.\r\n\r\nWith his hunting sack and spear, Robinson began to creep very, very\r\ncautiously through the underbrush. But he did not go far before he saw a\r\nlot of rabbits feeding peacefully on the soft leaves and grass. He drew\r\nback and threw his spear with all his might. But the spear did not reach\r\nthe rabbits. It fell far short and the rabbits sprang up and ran quickly\r\naway. He tried it several times with the same result. Then Robinson,\r\ndiscouraged, turned back home and ate his corn, bananas, and cocoanuts\r\nwithout meat. In the meantime he found a new kind of food. He\r\ndiscovered a nest of eggs. How good they tasted to him!\r\n\r\nBut his longing for meat was still very great. \"I will try to make a bow\r\nand arrow,\" he said. No sooner said than done. He bent a long piece of\r\ntough, young wood and stretched between the ends a cord twisted out of\r\nthe fiber taken from the cocoanut shell. He then sought for a piece of\r\nwood for arrows. He split the ends with his flint knife and fastened in\r\nsplinters of stone. At the other end he fastened on some feathers found\r\non the ground. The arrows flew through the air with great swiftness.\r\n\"They will go far enough,\" thought Robinson, \"if I could only hit\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nHe practised shooting. He stuck his stone knife in a tree and shot at it\r\nthe whole day long. At first he could not hit it at all. The arrows flew\r\nfar from the mark. After a while he could hit the tree, but not the\r\nknife. Then as he practised, his arm grew ever surer, until at last he\r\ncould hit the knife at almost every attempt. After a few days he again\r\nwent rabbit hunting. He thought that the rabbit did not offer a mark so\r\nhigh as his knife, so he stuck a stone in the ground and practised\r\nshooting at that. He gradually increased the distance until he could hit\r\nthe mark at twenty or thirty yards.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Robinson took his bow and arrows and went out to hunt.\r\nHe aimed at a rabbit, shot, and it fell, pierced by the arrow. His very\r\nfirst shot was successful.\r\n\r\nHe hastened up and took the dead rabbit on his shoulder, carried it to\r\nhis cave and skinned it. Then he cut off a nice, large piece of meat and\r\nwas going to roast it, but alas, he had no fire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S SHOES AND PARASOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Robinson could not get up. His feet were swollen and\r\nsore in consequence of walking without shoes over thorns and stones. He\r\nmust remain the whole day in his cave.\r\n\r\nBefore him, in the sun, his walking stick stuck in the ground. He\r\nthought how he had been troubled yesterday to find his way and about the\r\nshadow. He had now time to study it. He watched it the whole day\r\nthrough. In the morning it pointed toward the land. In the evening\r\ntoward the sea. This comes from the daily movement of the sun. He\r\ndetermined to study the matter more carefully.\r\n\r\nRobinson got up and with great effort walked to the spring. There he\r\ncooled his burning feet, and gathered some large leaves, which he bound\r\non them. He decided to remain in his cave a few days, for he had enough\r\nfood stored up to last him some length of time. He planned how he might\r\nmake himself a pair of shoes. As soon as his feet were well, he sought\r\nout some thick bark and put fastenings of tough, strong fiber on it.\r\nThese served very well to protect his feet.\r\n\r\nBut he must have some further protection from the sun. It beamed so hot\r\nthat his hat was not enough. He made a parasol out of leaves like his\r\nhat. He took a straight stick for a handle. He tied some reeds together\r\nand bent them into a hoop. He then fastened the upper end of the stick\r\nin the center of the hoop by means of six reeds which formed the ribs of\r\nthe parasol. To keep out the sun he covered this framework with large,\r\nbroad leaves. With a cord he tied the stem ends of the leaves to the\r\nstick just above where the reeds were tied.\r\n\r\nSpread out, these broad leaves completely covered the ribs. Their tips\r\nreached over the hoop. They were fastened together by means of small,\r\nneedle-like fish-bones Robinson had found on the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nGETTING FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Robinson had heard that savages take two dry pieces of wood and rub\r\nthem so long on each other that they at length begin to burn.\r\n\r\nHe tried it. The sweat ran down his cheeks, but every time the wood was\r\nabout to catch fire his strength would give out, and he was obliged to\r\nrest, and when he began again the wood was cold.\r\n\r\n\"How will it be in winter,\" he cried, \"when it is cold, and I have no\r\nfire?\" He must try other ways of preparing meat for his table. He must\r\nthink of some other way of getting fire. He remembered that once, when a\r\nboy at home, he had in playing with a stick made it hot by twirling it\r\non end on a piece of wood. \"I will try this,\" he thought. He searched\r\nfor a good hard stick and a piece of wood upon which to turn or twirl it\r\nwith his hands. Having found the best materials at hand, he began to\r\ntwirl the stick. He made a little hollow in the block of wood in which\r\nto turn his upright stick. There was heat but no fire. He twirled and\r\ntwirled, but he could not get the wood hot enough to blaze up or ignite.\r\nHe had not skill. Besides his hands were not used to such rough\r\ntreatment. Soon they blistered and this method had to be given up.\r\n\r\n\"I must have fire,\" he still thought, and recalled the sparks that flew\r\nfrom the stone pavements of the streets when the iron shoes of the\r\nhorses struck them as they slipped and strained at their cruel loads.\r\nWhy may I not get fire by striking together two stones? He sought out\r\ntwo hard stones and with great diligence kept striking them together\r\nuntil his strength gave out, and he was obliged again to acknowledge\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that sometimes travelers put the meat underneath the\r\nsaddle and ride on it until it is soft. He tried it with pounding. He\r\nlaid some of the meat on a flat stone and pounded it. It became quite\r\nsoft and tasted very well. He then tried hanging it in the sun and\r\nfinally wrapped it in leaves and buried it for a few hours in the hot\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nROBINSON MAKES SOME FURNITURE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing troubled Robinson very much. He could not sit comfortably\r\nwhile eating. He had neither chair nor table. He wished to make them,\r\nbut that was a big job. He had no saw, no hammer, no auger and no nails.\r\nRobinson could not, therefore, make a table of wood.\r\n\r\nNot far from his cave he had seen a smooth, flat stone. \"Ay,\" thought\r\nhe, \"perhaps I can make me a table out of stone.\" He picked out the best\r\nstone and built up four columns as high as a table and on these he laid\r\nhis large, flat stone. It looked like a table, sure enough, but there\r\nwere rough places and hollows in it. He wanted it smooth. He took clay\r\nand filled up the holes and smoothed it off. When the clay dried, the\r\nsurface was smooth and hard. Robinson covered it with leaves and decked\r\nit with flowers till it was quite beautiful.\r\n\r\nWhen the table was done, Robinson began on a chair. He made it also of\r\nstone. It had no back. It looked like a bench. It was uncomfortable to\r\nsit on. Robinson covered it with moss. Then it was an easy seat.\r\n\r\nTable and chair were now ready. Robinson could not move them from one\r\ncorner to another, nor when he sat on the chair could he put his feet\r\nunder the table, and yet he thought them excellent pieces of furniture.\r\n\r\nEvery day Robinson went hunting and shot a rabbit, but the meat would\r\nnot keep. At home they would have put it in the cellar. If only he had a\r\ncellar! He saw near his cave a hole in the rock. He dug it out a little\r\nwith his mussel shell and found that it led back under a rock.\r\n\r\nFrom much bending over in digging, Robinson's back, unused to severe\r\ntoil, ached wretchedly. He decided to make a spade. With his flint he\r\nbored four holes in a great, round mussel shell. They formed a rectangle\r\nas long as a little finger and as wide. Through these holes he drew\r\ncocoanut fibre and bound the shell to a handle fast and strong.\r\n\r\nWith his spade he dug a hole so deep that he could stand in it upright.\r\nThen he put in a couple of shelves made of flat stones. In this cellar\r\nhe put his rabbit meat and his eggs. Then he laid branches over it and\r\nfinally covered the whole with leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON BECOMES A SHEPHERD\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his bow and arrow, Robinson went hunting every day. The rabbits\r\nsoon learned to know him and let themselves be seldom seen. As soon as\r\nthey saw him, they took alarm. They became timid and shy. One day\r\nRobinson went out as usual to shoot rabbits. He found none. But as he\r\ncame to a great rock he heard from behind a new sound, one he had not\r\nheard before in the island. Ba-a-a, it sounded.\r\n\r\n\"A kid,\" thought Robinson, \"like that with which I have so often played\r\nat home.\"\r\n\r\nHe slipped noiselessly around the rock and behold, really there stood a\r\nkid. He tried to call it, but the kid sought safety in flight. He\r\nhastened after it. Then he noticed that it was lame in one fore foot. It\r\nran into some brush, where Robinson seized it by the horns and held it\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nHow Robinson rejoiced! He stroked it and fondled it. Then he thought,\r\nhow could it come into this wilderness on this lonesome island? \"Has\r\nyour ship been cast upon the rocks too, and been broken to pieces? You\r\ndear thing, you shall be my comrade.\" He seized the goat by the legs,\r\nand no matter how it kicked, carried it to his cave.\r\n\r\nThen he fetched quickly a cocoanut shell full of water and washed and\r\nbathed the goat's wounded leg. A stone had rolled down from the hill and\r\nhad inflicted a severe wound on its left fore leg, or perhaps it had\r\nstepped into a crack in the rocks. Robinson tore off a piece of linen\r\nfrom his shirt, dipped it in water and bound it with shreds of the\r\ncocoanut upon the wound. Then he pulled some grass and moss and made a\r\nsoft bed near the door of the cave. After he had given it water, it\r\nlooked at him with thankful eyes and licked his hand.\r\n\r\nRobinson could not sleep that night. He thought continually of his goat\r\nand got up time and again to see if it was safe. The moon shone clear in\r\nthe heavens. As Robinson sat before the goat's bed he looked down on his\r\nnew possession as lovingly as a mother on her child.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Robinson's first thought was, \"I am no longer alone. I\r\nhave a companion, my goat.\" He sprang up and looked for it. There she\r\nlay on her side, still sleeping.\r\n\r\nAs he stood and considered, the thought came to him that perhaps the\r\ngoat had escaped from its keeper. There must then be some one living on\r\nthe land. He quickly put on his shoes and his hat, took his parasol, and\r\nran to the rock where he had found the goat.\r\n\r\nHe called, he sought, he peered about to see if some shepherd were there\r\nsomewhere. He found nothing. He found no trace of man. There was no\r\nroad, no bridge, no field, no logs, not even a chip or shaving to show\r\nthat the hand of man had been there.\r\n\r\nBut what was that? In the distance ran a herd of goats over the rocks.\r\nBut no dog followed them and no shepherd. They ran wild on the island.\r\nThey had perhaps been left there by some ship. As he came home he\r\nnoticed the goat sorrowfully. The bandage had become dry. The goat might\r\nbe suffering pain. Robinson loosened the bandage, washed the wound again\r\nand bound it up anew. It was so trustful. It ran after him and he\r\ndecided always to protect it.\r\n\r\n\"I will always be your shepherd and take care of you,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nROBINSON BUILDS A HOME FOR HIS GOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the goat was a new care. Wild animals could come and kill and carry\r\nRobinson's goat away while he slept, and if the goat got frightened\r\nwhile he was hunting it would run away.\r\n\r\n\"I will have to make me a little yard in front of my cave,\" he said,\r\n\"for my goat to live in.\" But from whence must come the tools? He had\r\nneither hatchet nor saw. Where then were the stakes to come from? He\r\nwent in search of something. After hunting for a long time he came upon\r\na kind of thistle about two feet higher than himself, having at its top\r\na red torch-like blossom. There were a great many of them.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" thought Robinson. \"If I could only dig up enough of them and\r\nplant them thick around the door of my cave, I would have just the\r\nthing. No one could get at me, nor at the goat, either. The thorns would\r\nkeep anything from creeping through, peeping in or getting over.\"\r\n\r\nSo he took his mussel-shell spade and went to work. It was pretty hard,\r\nbut at length he succeeded in laying bare the roots of quite a number.\r\nBut he could not drag them to his cave on account of the thorns sticking\r\nin him. He thought a long time. Finally, he sought out two strong poles\r\nor branches which were turned up a little at one end and like a sled\r\nrunner. To these he tied twelve cross-pieces with bark. To the foremost\r\nhe tied a strong rope made from cocoa fiber. He then had something that\r\nlooked much like a sled on which to draw his thistle-like brush to his\r\ncave. But for one day he had done enough. The transplanting of the\r\nthistles was hard work. His spade broke and he had to make a new one. In\r\nthe afternoon he broke his spade again. And as he made his third one, he\r\nmade up his mind that it was no use trying to dig with such a weak tool\r\nin the hard ground. It would only break again.\r\n\r\n\"If I only had a pick.\" But he had none. He found a thick, hard, sharp\r\nstone. With it he picked up the hard earth, but had to bend almost\r\ndouble in using it. \"At home,\" he thought, \"they have handles to picks.\"\r\nThe handle was put through a hole in the iron. He turned the matter\r\nover and over in his mind, how he might put a hole through the stone.\r\nBut he found no means. He searched out a branch with a crotch at one\r\nend. He tied the stone to this with strong cocoa fiber and bark. How his\r\neye glistened as he looked at the new tool! Now he began to work. He\r\nfirst loosened up the earth with his pick, then he dug it out with his\r\nspade and planted in a high thistle. Many days he had to work, but\r\nfinally one evening the hedge was ready. He had a row in a semi-circle\r\nin front of his cave. He counted the marks on his calendar tree. The day\r\non which he had begun to make his hedge he had especially marked out.\r\nHe had worked fourteen days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S TOOLS]\r\n\r\nHe had completed his hedge with the exception of a small hole that must\r\nserve for a door. But the door must not be seen from without.\r\n\r\nAs Robinson thought, it came to him that there was still place for two\r\nthistles on the outside. He could easily get in, but the entrance was\r\ndifficult to find from the outside.\r\n\r\nRobinson looked on his hedge from without. It was not yet thick enough.\r\nFor this reason he planted small thistles between the larger ones. With\r\nthe digging them out and transplanting them he was a whole week longer.\r\n\r\nFinally, the hedge and the yard were ready. Now Robinson could rest\r\nwithout fear and sleep in his cave, and could have his goat near him all\r\nthe time. It delighted him greatly. It ran after him continually like a\r\ndog. When he came back from an absence, it bleated for joy and ran to\r\nmeet him as soon as he got inside the hedge. Robinson felt that he was\r\nnot entirely alone. He had now a living being near him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nROBINSON GETS READY FOR WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that troubled Robinson greatly. \"What will become of\r\nme when the winter comes? I will have no fire to warm me. I have no\r\nclothing to protect me from the cold, and where shall I find food when\r\nsnow and ice cover all the ground and when the trees are bare and the\r\nspring is frozen? It will be cold then in my cave; what shall I do? It\r\nis cold and rainy already. I believe this is harvest time and winter\r\nwill soon be here. Winter and no stove, no winter clothing, no winter\r\nstore of food and no winter dwelling. What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\nHe considered again the project of making fire. He again sought out two\r\npieces of wood and sat down and rubbed them together. The sweat rolled\r\ndown his face. When the wood began to get warm, his hand would become\r\ntired, and he would have to stop. When he began again the wood was cold.\r\nHe worked for an hour or two, then he laid the wood aside and said, \"I\r\ndon't believe I can do it. I must do the next best thing. I can at least\r\nget warm clothing to protect me from the rain and snow.\" He looked down\r\nat his worn, thin clothing, his trousers, his shirt, his jacket; they\r\nhad become so thin and worn that they were threadbare.\r\n\r\n\"I will take the skins of the hares which I have shot and will make me\r\nsomething,\" he thought. He washed and cleaned them, but he needed a\r\nknife and he set about making one. He split one end of a tough piece of\r\nwood, thrust his stone blade in it and wound it with cocoa fibre. His\r\nstone knife now had a handle. He could now cut the skins quite well. But\r\nwhat should he do for needle and thread? Maybe the vines would do. \"But\r\nthey are hardly strong enough,\" he thought. He pulled the sinews from\r\nthe bones of the rabbit and found them hard. Maybe he could use them. He\r\nfound fish skeletons on the seashore and bored a hole in the end of the\r\nsmall, sharp rib bones. Then he threaded his bone needle with the rabbit\r\nsinews and attempted to sew, but it would not go. His needle broke. The\r\nskin was too hard. He bored holes in the edge of the pieces of skin and\r\nsewed through the holes. This went very well.\r\n\r\nHe sewed the skins together with the hair side inward, made himself a\r\njacket, a pair of trousers, a hat, and finally covered his parasol with\r\nrabbit skin, for the rain had already dripped through the leaves of it.\r\nAll went well, only the trousers did not fit. He loosened them and\r\npuckered them to no purpose. \"Anyway,\" he thought, \"I am now well\r\nprotected from the cold, when it does come.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON IN HIS NEW SUIT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nHOW ROBINSON LAYS UP A STORE OF FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for the food. Could Robinson preserve the meat? He had often heard\r\nhis mother tell about preserving meat in salt. He had even eaten salt\r\nmeat, pickled meat. But where could he get salt?\r\n\r\nOne day when the wind blew hard the water was driven upon the shore and\r\nfilled a little hollow. After a few days the ground glistened white as\r\nsnow where the water had been. Was it snow? Robinson took it in his\r\nhands and put it in his mouth. It was salt. The sun had evaporated the\r\nwater in the hollow--had vaporized it--and the air had drunk it up. What\r\nwas left behind? Salt. Now he could get salt as long as he needed it.\r\n\r\nHe took cocoanut shells and strewed salt in them. Then he cut the rabbit\r\nmeat in thin strips, rubbed them with salt, and laid them one on the\r\nother in the salt in the shells. He covered it over with a layer of\r\nsalt. He put over each shell the half of a larger one and weighted it\r\ndown with stones. After a period of fourteen days he found the meat\r\nquite red. It had pickled.\r\n\r\nBut he did not stop here. He gathered and stored in his cellar cocoanuts\r\nand corn in such quantities that he would be supplied for a whole\r\nwinter. It seemed best to catch a number of rabbits, build a house for\r\nthem and keep them. Then he could kill one occasionally and have fresh\r\nmeat. Then it came to him that goats would be much better, for they\r\nwould give milk. He determined immediately to have a herd of goats. He\r\nmade a string or lasso out of cocoa fibre.\r\n\r\nThen he went out, slipped up quietly to a herd of goats and threw the\r\nlasso over one. But the lasso slipped from the horns and the goat ran\r\naway. The next day he had better luck. He threw the lasso, drew it tight\r\nand the goat was captured. He brought it home. He rejoiced when he saw\r\nthat it gave milk. He was happy when he got his first cocoanut shell\r\nfull of sweet rich milk. His goat herd grew. He soon had five goats. He\r\nhad no more room in his yard. He could not provide food enough. He must\r\nlet them out. He must make another hedge around his yard so that the\r\ngoats could get food and yet be kept from going away. He got stakes\r\nfrom the woods and gathered them before his cave. He sharpened them and\r\nbegan to drive them in the earth. But it rained more and more each day.\r\nHe was wet through as he worked. He had finally to stop work, for the\r\nrain was too heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S DIARY\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was much disturbed because he had no means of keeping a record\r\nof things as they happened from day to day. He had his calendar, it is\r\ntrue. He would not lose track of the time. But he wished for some way to\r\nwrite down his thoughts and what happened. So he kept up keen search for\r\nanything that would serve him for this purpose.\r\n\r\nEvery time he journeyed about the island he kept careful watch for\r\nsomething that he might write upon. He thought of the leaves of the palm\r\ntree, the white under surface of the shelf fungus. But these he found\r\nwould not do. He tried many kinds of bark and leaves. There was a kind\r\nof tall reed or grass growing in the marshes whose rind seemed good when\r\ndried. He examined the inner bark of many trees. He at last found that\r\nthe inner bark of a tree which resembled our elm tree worked best. He\r\nwould cut through the bark with his stone knife around the tree. At\r\nabout one foot from this he would cut another ring. He then would cut\r\nthrough the bark lengthwise from one circular cut to the other. He could\r\nthen peel off the section easily. While it was yet full of sap he would\r\nseparate the soft, tough, thin inner layer of the bark. This usually\r\ncame off in sheets without a break. When these sheets of bark were\r\nstretched and dried they could be used very nicely instead of paper.\r\n\r\nRobinson next searched for something that would serve him as ink, and\r\nthis was much easier to find than paper. He had noticed many kinds of\r\ngalls of many different colors growing on trees. He did not know what\r\nthey were, or how they grew, but he had learned in his father's store\r\nthat ink was often made from galls gathered from trees. \"Anyway,\" he\r\nthought, \"I can get ink from the cuttle-fish.\" He had watched this\r\nanimal get away from its enemies by sending out a cloud of purplish\r\nfluid, in which to hide as it darted away. He had learned also that\r\nindigo is made from the leaves of a plant. He had noticed a plant\r\ngrowing in the open places in the forest whose leaves turned black when\r\ndried.\r\n\r\nRobinson gathered a quantity of gall-nuts and soaked them in water. To\r\nthe black fluid thus obtained he added a little rice water to make it\r\nflow well, and this served very well as an ink. He kept his ink in a cup\r\nmade from a cocoanut shell.\r\n\r\nHe was not long in getting a pen, though the lack of a good sharp knife\r\nmade it hard to make a good one. In going about he had gathered a\r\nquantity of large feathers. He saved these for the time when he should\r\nhave his paper and ink ready. Now, he cut away a quill to a point and\r\nsplit it up a little way. He was now supplied with writing materials.\r\n\"Is it not wonderful,\" he thought, \"how all our wants are filled? We\r\nhave only to want a thing badly enough and it comes.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson began at once to write down the date for each day and the main\r\nthing he did or that happened on it. He called this his diary. He had\r\nnow a better way of keeping time than on his tree calendar. He did not\r\nneed it any more.\r\n\r\nYou have no doubt wondered how Robinson could work in his cave,\r\nespecially at night without a light. The truth is, it was a great source\r\nof discomfort to him. At sunset he was in total darkness in his cave.\r\nDuring the day light enough streamed in from the open doorway. To be\r\nalone in total darkness is not pleasant. \"If I only had fire!\" he said\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nHe watched the many large beetles and fire-flies flash their light in\r\nthe dark of the evening as he sat in front of his shelter. The thought\r\ncame to him that if he only had some way of keeping together a number of\r\nthem, they would serve very well for a candle in his cave at night. How\r\nhe longed for a glass bottle such as he had so often wantonly broken\r\nwhen at home! Back of his shelter there was a hill where the rock layers\r\njutted out. He had noticed here several times the thin transparent rock\r\nthat he had seen in his father's store. It is called isinglass.\r\n\r\n\"I will make a living lantern,\" he said aloud in his eagerness.\r\n\r\nHe soon had a suitable piece pried loose. He cut a part of a cocoanut\r\nshell away and in its place he put a sheet of isinglass. That evening at\r\ndark he gathered several handfuls of the great fire beetles and put them\r\nin his lantern. What joy their glow gave him in his cave at night. It\r\nwas almost as much comfort as a companion. But while it lighted up the\r\ndeep dark of the cave and enabled him to move about, he was unable after\r\nall to write in his diary at night. Every morning he set his captives\r\nfree. In the evening he would go out and capture his light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON IS SICK\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening Robinson went to bed sound and well. The next morning he was\r\nsick. Before he had only the heat of the day to complain of. To-day he\r\nwas freezing. He wanted to go to work to get warm, but even this did not\r\nbreak his chill. It increased till his teeth chattered with the cold.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" thought he, \"if I can sleep a little I will get better.\" But\r\nhe could not sleep. He was burning with fever and then shaking with cold\r\nby turns. He felt a strong thirst, but he was so weak that he could\r\nscarcely get the goat's milk. He had no sooner drunk the milk than his\r\ntongue was as dry as before. He felt better after a night of sleep, but\r\nthe next day his fever and chills were worse than before. Then he\r\nbethought him of his parents. How kindly his mother had taken care of\r\nhim! Now no one was near that could assist him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he sighed, \"must I die here? Who would bury me? There is no one\r\nto miss me.\" At this the tears came to his eyes.\r\n\r\nHis sickness increased with each day. Occasionally the fever would go\r\ndown sufficiently to allow him to get something to eat. Then it would be\r\nworse than before. In his dire need he wanted to pray, but he was so\r\nweak that he could only stammer, \"Dear God, help me, or I shall die!\"\r\n\r\nOne night he had a strange dream. He thought he saw his good old father\r\nstanding before him calling to him. He spread out his arms and cried\r\naloud, \"Here I am, here I am!\" He tried to get up, but he was so weak\r\nthat he fell back fainting.\r\n\r\nHe lay there a long time, but finally came to. He felt a burning thirst,\r\nbut no one reached him a drop of water. He prepared to die. He folded\r\nhis hands and prayed to God that he would be merciful to him. He prayed\r\nforgiveness from his parents. Once more he raised his head and gazed\r\nwildly around, then he sank back and knew no more.\r\n\r\nWhen he again awoke he felt better. His hot fever had gone. He attempted\r\nto walk. He had just enough strength to crawl to the table and fetch a\r\nshell of water. When he tried to walk he had to sit down at every two or\r\nthree steps.\r\n\r\nFrom this he recovered gradually, growing better and better, and he\r\nthanked God inwardly for his recovery. His sickness had continued from\r\nJune 18 to July 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nROBINSON'S BOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson's sickness set him thinking about his home. He had been so\r\nafraid of animals when he came to the island that he thought of nothing\r\nbut protection from them. He had been now a year on the island and had\r\nseen nothing more dangerous than a goat. The fear of animals had\r\npractically faded away. In thinking over his sickness he made up his\r\nmind that it was caused by sleeping in his cave where the sun never\r\nshone. The ventilation seemed good, but the walls were damp, especially\r\nin the rainy season. Then the water would trickle down through the cleft\r\nin spite of all he could do.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to build, if possible, a little cottage, or, as he called\r\nit, a bower, in the yard in front of his shelter. The hedge of thistles\r\nwas growing and formed a fence that an animal could not get through. His\r\nscreen of willows on the outside of this would soon hide him from view\r\nfrom the sea. He had the wall of rock and the hill behind him.\r\n\r\nHe planned out his way of building it very carefully. \"It must be done,\"\r\nhe said (Robinson formed the habit of talking to himself, so that he\r\nwould not forget how to talk), \"without hammer, nails, or saw.\"\r\n\r\nHe first sought out four posts, as large as he could well handle. There\r\nwere always broken trees and branches in the forest. If he searched long\r\nenough he could find posts just suited to his need. He wanted four of\r\nthe same thickness and height and with a fork at the end. After long\r\nsearching he found what he wanted. He was careful to get those that he\r\ncould drag to his shelter.\r\n\r\nHe placed these in the ground, forming the corners of a square about ten\r\nfeet long. In the forks he placed poles running around about eight feet\r\nfrom the ground. At about every three feet he fastened others, running\r\nin the same way, with heavy cords made of fibre. He found his greatest\r\ntrouble with the roof. It must be sloped to shed rain. He had to find\r\ntwo more forked posts, three or four feet longer than the others. These\r\nhe placed opposite each other in the centers of two sides. Upon these he\r\nplaced a ridge pole. He then laid other poles lengthwise from ridge pole\r\nto the edge of the frames.\r\n\r\nHis frame was now done. His plan was now to cover this frame with straw\r\nor grasses tied in bundles. He had seen the barns in the country\r\nthatched in this way by the Dutch farmers in New York State. He gathered\r\nthe straw of the wild rice. It was long, straight and tough. It was\r\neasily tied into flat bundles. These he bound securely on to the frame\r\nwork with cords. He began at the bottom so that the ends of the row\r\nwould lap over the tops of the last one put on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S BOWER]\r\n\r\nIn this way he built a very comfortable and rainproof bower. It was\r\neasy to make a bed of poles covered with straw. A table and bench were\r\nadded and shelves of poles.\r\n\r\nRobinson felt great joy over this new home. \"I will not now be sick any\r\nmore,\" he said. \"In case of danger I can get into my cave. But at all\r\nother times I will live in my bower.\" He had use still for his cave. He\r\ncould use it to store some things in. But he had to be careful about the\r\ndampness in wet weather.\r\n\r\nRobinson was getting to feel at home. He was no longer so sad. He did\r\nnot grieve so much for home. He looked upon his home with great delight.\r\nIt was secure. He had his herd of goats always in his sight. At evening\r\nhe would do his milking. He found he could keep the milk for some time\r\nin the cave. He was tempted to try making some butter from the good,\r\nrich cream. \"But,\" said Robinson, \"I have neither vessels to make it in\r\nnor bread to eat it on.\"\r\n\r\nHe planned many things to do. \"I will make a hammock some day for my\r\nbower and some vessels to use in my work,\" he thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nROBINSON AGAIN EXPLORES HIS ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Robinson recovered his strength he had a strong desire to see more\r\nof the island. At first he had been in constant fear of wild animals,\r\nbut now he thought he would like to see all there was to see in the\r\nisland. On the 15th of July he started out. First he went to a brook\r\nwhich ran into the sea near his cave. Its water was clear and pure;\r\nalong its shore lay beautiful meadows. As he came to the upper course of\r\nthe brook the meadow gave way to forest. On the border of the forest he\r\nfound melons and grapes.\r\n\r\nThe night came on and he slept again in a tree. The next morning he went\r\nfarther and came to a clear rivulet. Here the region was wonderfully\r\nbeautiful. The flowers bloomed as in a garden, and near the flowers\r\nstood splendid apple and orange trees. He took as much of the fruit as\r\nhe could carry and went on his way. This journey continued three days.\r\nThe grapes which he had carried he dried in the sun and made raisins.\r\n\r\nThe 10th of September came, one year had passed on the island. He was\r\nmany hundred miles from home, alone on an island. With tears he cried\r\nout, \"Ah! what are my dear parents saying? They have no doubt long given\r\nme up as dead. If I could only send them a message to comfort them and\r\nlet them know how much I love them!\"\r\n\r\nThe day was celebrated as a holiday. He thanked God that He had given\r\nhim so many good things. Often he had lived the whole day in care and\r\nanxiety. Now he tried to be more cheerful and to meet the troubles of\r\neach day with courage.\r\n\r\nBut Robinson was not yet satisfied. He longed to know more of the island\r\nand prepared himself for a greater journey. He slung his hunting pouch\r\nover his shoulder, filled it full of food, took his bow and arrows,\r\nstuck his stone hatchet in his belt and started on his way. He traveled\r\nover meadows, through beautiful forests in which were hundreds of birds.\r\nHe was delighted as they sang and fluttered about.\r\n\r\nThe journey was beautiful and pleasant to Robinson. In the forests he\r\noften saw small wild creatures, but he shot nothing. After the first\r\nnight he slept under a tree in the soft grass, for he had now no fear of\r\nwild animals.\r\n\r\nAlong the shore he saw great groves of palms with their large nuts. He\r\nsaw, too, many goats in all parts of the island.\r\n\r\nNow he was ready to take the shortest way home. He had not gone far\r\nbefore he came into a dark forest. He became confused and wandered about\r\nfor several days. On the fourth day he came to a little pile of stones,\r\nwhich he had made to mark the way as he was going out. From this place\r\nthe way was easy to find. On this trip he was gone already two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nROBINSON AND HIS BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the things he saw on his journey Robinson was most delighted with\r\nthe birds. They were of the most beautiful colors. The forest was full\r\nof them. They gleamed like jewels in the deep masses of foliage. In the\r\nmorning their singing filled the air with sound.\r\n\r\nRobinson had never taken much notice of the birds at home. But now every\r\nliving thing attracted him. He loved to see them happy. He would watch\r\noften by the hour and learn the habits of nesting and getting food of\r\nnearly every bird on the island.\r\n\r\nRobinson did not know the names of many of the birds he saw on the\r\nisland. He had to make names for them. The strangest thing he saw on his\r\njourney was the nest of what he called the yellow-tail. This bird lives\r\nin colonies and makes its nest at the ends of the long leaves of the\r\nmountain palm. When he first saw these queer looking sacks hanging from\r\nthe leaves he was amazed. He had never seen so strange a sight. From\r\nthe end of each great leaf hung a long, closely woven nest. Robinson\r\ncould not make out at first what they were. Soon, however, he saw the\r\nbirds come out of the mouths of the nests. Here, one hundred feet from\r\nthe ground, they hung their nests. But they were perfectly safe.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far from the tree in which the yellow tails had their\r\nnests when he was suddenly startled by a voice crying, \"Who, who are\r\nyou?\" Robinson was greatly frightened and hid beneath the drooping\r\nbranches of a cedar tree. He feared every moment that the owner of the\r\nvoice would make his appearance. But it kept at a distance. Every few\r\nminutes from the depths of the forest would come the doleful cry, \"Who,\r\nwho are you?\" Robinson did not dare to stir from his hiding place. He\r\nremained there over night. After the night came on he heard the strange\r\nvoice no more.\r\n\r\nThe next day he renewed his journey. He saw many birds that were wholly\r\nstrange to him. There was a kind of wild pigeon that built its home in a\r\nhole in the rock. It was a most beautiful bird with long, slender,\r\ngraceful feathers in its tail. He saw the frigate bird soaring high\r\nabove the island. The number and beauty of the humming-birds amazed\r\nRobinson. They were of all colors. One had a bill in the shape of a\r\nsickle. The most brilliant of them all was the ruby-crested\r\nhumming-bird.\r\n\r\nNear noon, while Robinson was shielding himself from the scorching heat\r\nof the sun in a deep, shaded glen, he was startled again by the strange\r\nvoice crying, \"Who, who, who are you?\" He lay quite still, determined if\r\npossible to allow the voice to come, if it would, within sight. He heard\r\nit slowly coming up the glen. Each time it repeated the cry it sounded\r\nnearer. At last he saw spying at him through the boughs of the tree\r\nunder which he was lying a large bird with soft, silky feathers of green\r\nand chestnut. \"Who, who, who are you?\" said the bird. Robinson could not\r\nhelp but laugh. He had been frightened at the cry of a bird.\r\n\r\nBut the bird that interested Robinson most was the parrot. There were\r\nseveral kinds of them. They flew among the trees with great noise and\r\nclatter and shrieking. Robinson determined if possible to secure one for\r\na pet. \"I can teach it to talk,\" he said, \"and I will have something to\r\ntalk to.\" As soon as he returned home he set about catching one. He\r\nnoticed that a number were in the habit of visiting an old tree near\r\nthe shelter every morning. He planned to snare one and tried several\r\nmornings, but he could not get one into the snare. He tried to hit one\r\nwith his bow and arrow. He at last succeeded in hitting one and stunning\r\nit so that it fell to the ground. He ran rapidly to pick it up, but\r\nbefore he could get to where it lay in the bushes it had disappeared.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking the matter over he concluded that it would be much better\r\nto get a pair of young birds and raise them. The old ones would be hard\r\nto tame and difficult to teach. It was easy enough to find a nest in a\r\nhollow tree. He secured from the nest two birds just ready to fly. He\r\nmade a cage for them out of willow rods. He placed the cage at the\r\nentrance of his cave and studied how he would feed them. Much to his\r\nsurprise the parent birds discovered their young ones and brought them\r\nfood and fed them through the open work of the cage.\r\n\r\nWhen the birds were grown they rapidly learned to talk. Robinson took\r\ngreat delight in teaching them. He taught them to call his name and when\r\nhe came near they would call out, \"Poor old Robinson Crusoe!\"\r\n\r\nThese birds remained for many years with Robinson. In fact, he was never\r\nafterward without a parrot. They helped him to pass away very\r\npleasantly many hours that without them would have been sad.\r\n\r\nAnother bird that Robinson loved was the little house wren. This bird\r\nwas exceedingly tame and friendly. It was a very sweet and strong\r\nsinger. It loved to make its nest in or near his shelter. There it would\r\nbuild and rear its young, within reach of his hands, while its throat\r\nwas always bursting with melody.\r\n\r\nThe mocking bird, too, always nested near and awakened him in the\r\nmorning with its wonderful song.\r\n\r\nRobinson became a great friend and favorite of the bird inhabitants of\r\nthe island. They seemed to know him and showed no fear when near him.\r\nThis pleased him very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nROBINSON GETS FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was now pretty comfortable. He had his bower with its chair and\r\ntable. He had his cave in case of danger. He had his cellar in which to\r\nkeep his meat. He would sit in the shade near the door of his bower and\r\nthink of the many things he should be thankful for. But there was one\r\nhardship that Robinson could not get used to and that was the eating of\r\nraw food. \"How fine it would be if only I could parch a few grains of\r\ncorn in the fire! I could like live a prince,\" thought he, \"if I had\r\nfire. I would grind some of my corn into flour and make some corn bread\r\nor cakes and cook rice.\" He did so long for roasted meat and determined\r\nagain to make the attempt to get fire.\r\n\r\nRobinson was fast losing his idle, thoughtless ways of doing things. He\r\nhad become a thoughtful and diligent man in the short time that he had\r\nbeen on the island. Trouble and hardship had made a man of him. \"I must\r\ncarefully think over the whole matter of getting fire,\" he said. He had\r\nfailed twice and was now resolved to succeed. \"If the lightning would\r\nonly strike a tree,\" he thought, \"and set it on fire.\"\r\n\r\nBut he could not wait for such a thing to happen, and how could he keep\r\nit when once thus obtained? It was clear he must have some way of\r\nproducing fire when he wanted it, just as they did at home. He thought\r\nover the ways he had tried and the one most likely to be successful. He\r\nresolved to make a further trial of the method by twirling a stick in\r\nhis hands. He selected new wood that was hard and dry. He carefully\r\nsharpened a stick about eighteen inches long and, standing it upright in\r\na hollow in the block of wood, began to roll it between his hands. By\r\nthe time Robinson's hands were well hardened, it seemed that he was\r\ngoing to succeed at last. But he lacked the skill to be obtained only by\r\nlong practice.\r\n\r\n\"If I could only make it go faster,\" he said. \"There must be some way of\r\ndoing this. I believe I can do it. I used to make my top spin round with\r\na cord; I wonder if I can use the cord here.\" The only cord he had was\r\nattached to his bow. He was going to take it off when a thought struck\r\nhim. He loosened the string a bit and twisted it once about his\r\nspindle. Then he drew the bow back and forth. The spindle was turned at\r\na great rate. He saw he must hold one end with his left hand while the\r\nother rested in the hollow in the block. With his right, he drew the bow\r\nback and forth. How eagerly he worked! He had twirled but a few minutes\r\nwhen the dust in the hollow burst into fire from the heat produced by\r\nthe rapidly twirling spindle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S TOOLS FOR MAKING FIRE]\r\n\r\nRobinson was too overjoyed to make any use of it. He danced and capered\r\nabout like one gone mad until the fire had gone out. But that was of no\r\nmatter now, since he could get fire when he wanted it.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to make him a rude fireplace and oven of stones. He hollowed\r\nout a place in the ground and lined and covered it with large flat\r\nstones. On one side he built up a chimney to draw up the smoke and make\r\nthe fire burn brightly. He brought wood and some dry fungus or\r\nmushroom. This he powdered and soon had fire caught in it. He kindled in\r\nthis way the wood in his stove and soon had a hot fire.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did in the way of cooking was to roast some rabbit\r\nmeat on a spit or forked stick held in his hand over the fire. Nothing\r\nRobinson had ever eaten was to be compared to this.\r\n\r\n\"I can do many things now,\" thought Robinson. \"My work will not be\r\nnearly so hard. My fire will be my servant and help me make my tools as\r\nwell as cook my food. I can now cook my corn and rice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON MAKES BASKETS\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson still continued anxious about his food supply when he could no\r\nlonger gather it fresh from the fields and forest. Corn had again become\r\nripe. He had found in a wet, marshy place some wild rice-plants loaded\r\nwith ripened grain. As he now had fire he only had to have some way of\r\nstoring up grains and he would not lack for food. He knew that grain\r\nstored away must be kept dry and that he must especially provide against\r\ndampness in his cave or in his bower.\r\n\r\nIf he only had some baskets. These would be just the thing. But how was\r\nhe to get them? Robinson had never given a thought to either material or\r\nthe method of making them. He, however, was gradually acquiring skill\r\nand confidence in himself. So far he had managed to meet all his wants.\r\nHe had invented tools and made his own clothes and shelter, and, \"Now,\"\r\nsaid he to himself, \"I will solve the new problem. I must first study\r\nthe materials that I have at hand.\" He remembered the splint market\r\nbaskets in which his father took vegetables home from the store. He\r\nrecalled how the thin splints were woven.\r\n\r\n\"They went over and under,\" he said. \"That is simple enough if I had the\r\nsplints.\" He set himself diligently to work to find a plant whose bark\r\nor split branches could be used for splints. He tried to peel off the\r\nrough outer bark of several trees in order to examine the inner layers\r\nof soft fibrous material. He found several trees that gave promise of\r\nfurnishing abundance of long, thin strips, but the labor of removing the\r\nbark with his rude imperfect tools was so great that he resolved that he\r\nwould have to find some other kind of material.\r\n\r\n\"Why need the strips be flat?\" he thought. \"I believe I could weave them\r\nin the same way if I used the long, thin, tough willow rods I saw\r\ngrowing by the brookside, when I was returning from my journey.\"\r\n\r\nHe found on trial that the weaving went very well, but that he must have\r\nstrong, thick rods or ribs running up and down to give strength and form\r\nto his basket. He worked hard, but it was slow work. It was three days\r\nbefore his first basket was done. He made many mistakes and was obliged\r\nmany times to undo what he had accomplished in order to correct some\r\nerror. And at last when he had woven the basket as large as he thought\r\nwas suitable for his purpose, he did not know how to stop or finish the\r\ntop so as to keep the basket from unraveling. At last he hit upon the\r\nplan of fastening two stout rods, one outside, the other inside, the\r\nbasket. These he sewed firmly, over and over, to the basket with a kind\r\nof fibre from a plant he had discovered that looked almost to be what he\r\nhad heard called the century plant in the parks at home.\r\n\r\nOn attempting his next basket, he thought long how he might improve and\r\nsave time. He must hasten, or the now almost daily rains would destroy\r\nhis ripened wild corn and rice.\r\n\r\n\"If I could use coils of that long grass I saw growing in the marsh\r\nbeside the rice,\" he thought, \"I could make twice the progress.\" He\r\ngathered an armful, twisted it into cables about an inch thick and wove\r\nit into his frame of upright rods instead of the horizontal layer of\r\nwillow canes. This answered his purpose just as well and rendered the\r\nmaking of large baskets the work of a few hours. He found, however, that\r\nthe willow rods or osiers were not pliant enough to work well in\r\nfastening his coils of grass cables together. He tried several things\r\nand at last succeeded best when he used the long thread-like fibre of\r\nthe century-like plant. He had, however, to make a stout framework of\r\nrods. He would first coil his grass rope into this frame and then sew it\r\ntogether with twine or thread made from this fibre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON'S BASKETS]\r\n\r\nHe afterwards tried making smaller and finer baskets out of the fibre\r\nthat he had discovered, which could be easily had from the thick-leaved\r\nplant he thought he had seen at home. He first used long, tough, fine\r\nroots he had seen when digging up the tree at the mouth of his cave.\r\nAfterwards he discovered some tall, tough reeds growing near by. He laid\r\nin a supply of these. He found that when he wanted to use them, a good\r\nsoaking in water made them as pliable and tough as when first cut.\r\n\r\nThe making of the baskets and storing up grains made it possible for\r\nRobinson to become a farmer and thus make himself independent. This\r\nthought was a great relief to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nROBINSON BECOMES A FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson had now been on the island long enough to know how the seasons\r\nchanged. He found that there were two kinds of weather there, wet\r\nweather and dry weather. There were two wet seasons in each year and two\r\ndry ones. During the wet seasons, which lasted nearly three months,\r\nRobinson had to remain pretty closely at home, and could not gather\r\ngrain, for the plants were then starting from the seeds. It ripened in\r\nthe dry seasons. Robinson soon found that he must have a store of corn\r\nand wild rice for food during the rainy seasons. He, however, knew\r\nnothing about planting and harvesting, nor preparing the ground for\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nHe had it all to learn with no teacher or books to instruct him. He\r\nfound a little space near his dwelling free from trees and thought he\r\nwould plant some corn seed here. He did not know the proper time for\r\nplanting. He thought because it was warm, seed would grow at any time.\r\nIt happened his first seed was put in at the beginning of the dry\r\nseason. He watched and waited to rejoice his eyes with the bright green\r\nof sprouting corn, but the seed did not grow. There was no rain and the\r\nsun's heat parched the land till it was dry and hard on the upland where\r\nhis corn was planted.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" thought Robinson, \"I will plant it at the beginning of the\r\nwet season, either in March or September.\" He did so; the seed quickly\r\nsprouted up. But the weeds, shrubs, and vines sprouted as quickly, and\r\nbefore Robinson was aware, his corn was overgrown and choked out by a\r\nrank growth of weeds and vines.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Robinson, \"that I must thoroughly prepare the soil before\r\nplanting my seed.\" But he had no spade and no other tool that would\r\nstand the strain of digging among tough matted roots. But he must\r\nsucceed. He put a new handle in the stone hoe or pick he had already\r\nmade. His mussel shell spade was worn out. He must set himself to\r\nfashion out another. He decided to make one from the tough heavy wood of\r\na tree that grew plentifully in the forest.\r\n\r\nHe was lucky enough to find a tree of this kind whose bole had been\r\nsplit lengthwise by the falling of an old rotten tree near it. With his\r\nstone tools and the help of fire he managed after several days' work to\r\nmake a wide sharpened tool out of one of the large pieces split off. It\r\nwas a little over three feet long. He had trimmed one end small and cut\r\nnotches in the sides about one foot from the flat end. He could place\r\nhis foot in the notch and thrust his wooden spade into the earth. With\r\nhis rude tool he dug up and turned the soil of a small space of ground\r\nseveral times to kill the vines and weeds. His corn quickly sprouted\r\nafter this attempt and outstripped the weeds and vines which Robinson\r\nconstantly had to hold in check by pulling and hoeing. He was rejoiced\r\nat his growing crop and went each morning to feast his eyes on the\r\nrapidly expanding leaves and ears.\r\n\r\nOne morning as he came in sight of the little clearing he thought he saw\r\nsomething disappearing in the low brush on the other side as he\r\napproached. Alas, his labor had been in vain! A herd of wild goats had\r\nfound out the place and had utterly destroyed his crop. Robinson sat\r\ndown nearby and surveyed the ruin of his little field. \"It is plain,\"\r\nthought he, \"I will have to fence in the field or I will never be able\r\nto harvest my crop. I cannot watch it all the time.\"\r\n\r\nHe had already learned from his experience in making the fence around\r\nthe goat pasture that the branches of many kinds of shrubs and trees,\r\nwhen broken off and thrust into the ground, will send out roots and\r\nleaves and at length if planted close together in a line, will form a\r\nthick hedge which no kind of beast can get through or over. He found out\r\nsome willow trees whose branches broke easily, and soon had enough to\r\nthrust into the ground about six inches apart around the entire edge of\r\nhis little field, which contained about one eighth of an acre.\r\n\r\nAfter this hedge had grown so as to be a fair protection to his crop he\r\ntried planting again at the proper season. He spaded up the ground and\r\npulled out the matted roots as best he could and with great pains and\r\ncare planted his corn in straight even rows. To make them straight and\r\neach hill of corn the same distance from its neighbors, he first marked\r\noff the ground in squares whose sides were about three and one half feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" thought he, \"I will reap the reward of my labor.\" The corn grew\r\nrapidly, and toward the end of the first dry season was filling out and\r\nripening its ears. But to Robinson's dismay a new danger threatened his\r\ncrop against which he could not fence. He was in despair. The birds were\r\nfast eating and destroying his partially ripened corn. He could not\r\nhusk it yet. It was not ripe enough. He thought how easy it would be to\r\nprotect his field if he had a gun. But he had learned that it is useless\r\nto give time to idle dreaming. He must do something and that quick.\r\n\r\n\"If I could catch some of these rascals,\" he thought, \"I would hang them\r\nup on poles, dead, as a warning to the rest.\" It seemed almost a\r\nhopeless task, but he went about it. It was in vain he tried to kill\r\nsome of them by throwing rocks and sticks. He could not get near enough\r\nto them. At length he laid snares and succeeded in snaring three birds.\r\nHe had learned to weave a pliable, strong thong out of cocoa and other\r\nfibre that he was now acquainted with. The birds thus caught he fastened\r\non broken branches of trees which he stuck into the earth in different\r\nparts of his field. The birds heeded the warning and visited his corn\r\nfield no more that season.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the season he gathered or husked his corn and after it was\r\nthoroughly dry he shelled it from the cob with his hands. He used his\r\nbaskets in which to carry his husked ears from the field to his cave and\r\nin which to store it when shelled. He found that the ears were larger\r\nand better filled and plumper than when the plants grew wild. He\r\nselected the largest and best filled ears for his seed the next time. In\r\nthis way his new crop of corn was always better in kind and yielded more\r\nthan the old one.\r\n\r\nAt first he grew two crops a year, but by experimenting he found out\r\nabout how much he needed for his own use and planted once a year enough\r\nto give him a liberal supply.\r\n\r\nHe observed that the wild rice grew in swampy lands, so that he did not\r\nmake the mistake of trying to raise it upon the upland where the corn\r\ngrew best. He saw at once that the planting of rice on low, marshy or\r\nwet land was beyond his present strength and tools. \"Some time in the\r\nfuture,\" he thought, \"I may try it.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson also found wild grapes in abundance. These he dried by hanging\r\nthem on the branches of trees. He thus had a store of raisins for each\r\nrainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS POTTER\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was now anxious to cook his food, to boil his rice and\r\nvegetables and bake bread, but he could do nothing without cooking\r\nvessels. He had tried to use cocoanut shells, but these were too small\r\nand there was no way to keep them from falling over and spilling the\r\ncontents. He determined to try to make some clay vessels. He knew where\r\nhe could get a kind of clay that had the appearance of making good ware.\r\nIt was fine grained and without lumps or pebbles. He was much perplexed\r\nto mould the clay into right shapes. He tried taking a lump and shaping\r\nit into a vessel with his hands. He tried many times, but each time the\r\nclay broke and he was forced to try some other way. He recalled how he\r\nhad made his basket out of strands of twisted grass and wondered whether\r\nhe could not make his pots in the same way.\r\n\r\nHe spun the clay out into a long rope and began to coil it around a\r\nsmall basket forming the layers together with his hands. This was easy,\r\nbut he did not see clearly how he was going to get the basket out from\r\nthe inside of the pot. He found he could copy in this way any form he\r\nwished, but he finally hit upon the plan of making a form of wicker work\r\nand coiling the clay rope inside it, for he saw that whether he\r\nsucceeded or not in getting the clay free from the basket he could use\r\nthe pot, and besides if the pot would stand the fire the basket would\r\nburn off. To dry the pots Robinson stood them in the sun a few days.\r\nWhen they were dry he tried to cook some soup in one of them. He filled\r\nit with water and put it on his stove or oven, but how sadly had he\r\ndeceived himself. In a short time the water soaked into the clay and\r\nsoon the pot had fallen to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"How foolish I am!\" said Robinson to himself; \"the pots have to be fired\r\nbefore they can be used.\" He set about this at once. He found two stones\r\nof equal size, placed them near each other and laid a third across\r\nthese. He then placed three large pots upon them and made a hot fire\r\nunder them. No sooner had the flame shot up than one of the pots cracked\r\nin two. \"I probably made the fire too hot at first,\" thought Robinson.\r\n\r\nHe drew out some of the coals and wood, but afterwards gradually\r\nincreased the fire again. He could not, however, get the pots hot enough\r\nto turn red. He brought the dryest and hardest wood, but could not\r\nsucceed in getting them hot enough to turn red. At length he was tired\r\nout and was compelled to give it up. When the pots were cool he tried to\r\nboil water in one. It was no better than the sun dried one.\r\n\r\nHe saw that he must provide some way to get the pots much hotter than he\r\ncould in the open air. He resolved to make an oven of stones large\r\nenough to take in the wood as well as the pots. It must be above ground\r\nso that there might be plenty of draught for the fire. With great labor,\r\nhe pried up and carried together flat stones enough to make an oven\r\nabout four feet high with a chimney at one side. He had put in the\r\ncenter a stone table on which he could place three quite large pots. He\r\nleft an opening in one side that could be partially closed by a large,\r\nflat stone.\r\n\r\nHe worked eagerly and at the end of the second day he was ready to fire\r\nhis oven. He first carried together a good quantity of dry wood, then he\r\nput in his pots and laid the wood around them. In a short time he had a\r\nvery hot fire. He kept this up all day and until late at night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME OF ROBINSON'S DISHES]\r\n\r\nThe next morning he went to his oven and found his pots were a beautiful\r\nred. He drew out the fire and allowed them to cool slowly. Then he\r\nfilled one with water and set it over the fire to heat it. Before many\r\nminutes the water was boiling and Robinson had another reason to be\r\nthankful. He wept for joy. His patient labors had brought their rewards.\r\nNo prince could feel as happy as Robinson now. He had overcome all\r\ndifficulties. Starting with nothing but his hands, he was now able to\r\nsupply all his wants. \"If I only had a companion now,\" he thought, \"I\r\nwould have nothing further to wish as long as I stay on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS BAKER\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that Robinson had fire, he determined to try to make bread. He had\r\nseen the servants at home make bread many times, but he had not observed\r\nclosely and knew next to nothing about the way bread is made. He knew he\r\nmust in some way grind the corn into flour, but how could he do this? He\r\nhad no mill nor any tools with which to crush the corn.\r\n\r\nHe first tried to find a stone large and hard enough out of which he\r\nmight hollow a vessel or kind of mortar. He thought he could put the\r\ncorn into this mortar and grind it by means of another stone or pestle.\r\nIt was with great difficulty that he could get a stone of suitable size\r\nand form. After several days' trial he at last got one cut out from some\r\nlayers of rock near the shore. He made a hollow place in it. Then he\r\ntook a smaller oblong shaped rock for his pestle.\r\n\r\nHe took great pride in these new tools. \"I shall soon be a\r\nstone-cutter,\" he said to himself, \"as well as a farmer and potter.\" But\r\nhis stone mortar was a failure. The rock was too soft. Every time he\r\nthrust the pestle down, it loosened small pieces of the stone vessel.\r\nThese mixed with the ground corn or flour and made it unfit to eat.\r\nThere was no way to separate the sand from the crushed grain.\r\n\r\nHe resolved then to try to make a mortar and pestle of hard wood. Now\r\nthat he had fire, he could do this, though it cost him many a hard day's\r\nwork. He found not far away a log of very hard wood. By building a fire\r\nat the right distance from one end he was able to separate a piece of\r\nthe log. He rolled this to his cave and made a good-sized hollow in it\r\nby burning. This pestle was not so difficult to make. He took a limb or\r\nbranch of an ironwood tree, burned it in two at the place to make it the\r\nright length. By burning also he rounded one end and then he was ready\r\nfor the grinding. After cleaning his mortar and pestle carefully he\r\nplaced some corn in the hollow and soon had some fine yellow meal or\r\nflour without any grit or sand in it.\r\n\r\nHis next care was to separate the coarse outer husk or covering of the\r\nkernel from the finer parts that make the meal. He had no sieve. His\r\nnet was too coarse. It let both bran and meal go through. \"I must make a\r\nnet or cloth fine enough to sift or bolt my flour,\" said he. Such was\r\nnow his skill in spinning and weaving that this was not hard to do. He\r\nhad soon woven in his loom a piece of fine netting which allowed the\r\nmeal to shake through, but held back the coarse bran or outer husk of\r\nthe kernel. Out of the dry corn that he had stored up he now made quite\r\na quantity of flour. This he kept tightly covered in a large earthen pot\r\nor jar that he had made for this purpose. \"I must keep all my food clean\r\nand protect it from the ants and other insects as well as dust and\r\ndamp,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nHis preparations were now nearly made. He had already his stove of flat\r\nstones. On this he could set his pots to boil water, cook rice, and\r\nmeat, but it would not do for baking a loaf of bread of any thickness.\r\nHe must have an oven or enclosed place into which he could put the loaf\r\nto bake it. By the use of flat stones he soon rebuilt his stove so as to\r\nhave an oven that did fine service. Now it was mixing the dough that\r\nclaimed his attention. He had of course no yeast to make raised or light\r\nbread. He poured goats' milk on the flour and kneaded it into a thick\r\ndough. He did not forget to add salt. He placed his loaf in a shallow\r\nearthen pan he had made for this purpose. After the fire had heated the\r\nstones of his oven through, he put in his loaf and soon was enjoying a\r\nmeal of corn bread and meat stew.\r\n\r\nRobinson soon tried to make cocoa from the beans of the cocoa palm that\r\ngrew in the island. This with good rich goats' milk in it he thought the\r\nbest drink in the world. He often thought of making sugar from the sugar\r\ncane plant he had discovered in the island. But the labor of squeezing\r\nout the juice was too great. He could think of no way to do this without\r\nthe help of horses or oxen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS FISHERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson was now eager to use his fire and cooking vessels. He had\r\nnoticed with hungry eyes fine large fish in the creek near his cave. But\r\nhe had never taken the trouble to catch any. \"What is the use?\" he\r\nthought. \"I cannot eat them raw.\" It was different now and he began to\r\ndevise ways of making a catch. How he longed for a fish-hook, such as he\r\nhad so often used when loitering along the Hudson River! \"But a\r\nfish-hook is not to be thought of,\" he said to himself, \"unless I can\r\nmake one of bone.\" He went down to the brook and searched long for a\r\nfish-bone that he might make use of for this purpose. He found nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I must try something else,\" he thought. He remembered the nets he used\r\nto see along the Hudson and wondered if he could not make a small one to\r\npull through the water and thus catch the fish.\r\n\r\nHe had now a better source of fibre for weaving and for spinning into\r\nlines and ropes. He had discovered this when he was trying to find a\r\ngood strong thread or yarn with which to bind the coils of his\r\ngrass-made baskets together. He obtained fibre in great abundance from\r\nthe century-like plant. He found if he broke off the long leaves of this\r\nplant and allowed them to decay there remained a long, tough fibrous\r\nsubstance out of which strong cords could be twisted or yarn made for\r\nweaving a coarse cloth or netting.\r\n\r\nOut of this he spun yarn thread to make a net about three or four feet\r\nby two feet. He fastened cords to four corners of this, tied them to a\r\nlong pole, and was now prepared to test his plan for catching fish.\r\n\r\nThe brook he found was too shallow for him to catch fish in this way. At\r\nthe sight of him and his net, they scurried away to deep water. Neither\r\ncould he succeed in the shallow water along the shore. \"I must wade out\r\nas far as I can,\" he said to himself, \"and draw the net through the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nAs he did this he was surprised at the many forms of sea life, new to\r\nhim, that he saw. He, however, was careful and watchful. He walked along\r\nnear the shore to a point where some rocks showed above the surface. As\r\nhe looked ahead he saw the single eye of a giant cuttle-fish glaring at\r\nhim from among the rocks. It was thrusting out its long arms towards\r\nhim. He drew back quickly, but as he did so he was terrified to hear the\r\nsnap of some huge creature's jaws near him. A great shark had seen him\r\nand had thrown himself on his back to seize him in his rows of sharp\r\nteeth, but was prevented reaching him by the shallowness of the water.\r\n\r\nRobinson was too much terrified to continue longer his attempt at\r\nfishing. He went back to his cave with only a few small ones, not worth\r\nthe trouble of dressing for his dinner.\r\n\r\nThe next day undismayed he tried again. He succeeded in drawing in some\r\nvery beautiful large fish. Their sides shone as burnished gold and\r\nsilver. \"Now,\" he thought, \"I will have a feast.\" He carried them home,\r\ncarefully cleaned and dressed them, seasoned them with his salt, and\r\nbroiled them over his fire. Imagine his disappointment when they proved\r\nunfit to eat. Their flesh was coarse and tough and ill-tasting. He saw\r\nthat the catching of fish for his table was a more difficult thing than\r\nhe thought it. He must not only catch fish, but catch ones that could be\r\neaten. He could only tell the good from the bad by trying them.\r\n\r\nHe was more fortunate in his next venture. He was going along the shore\r\nat the mouth of the creek which ran near his cave when he noticed a\r\ngroup of fishes, dark bluish above with silvery sides. The largest of\r\nthem were about two feet long. They were feeding on the bottom in the\r\nbrackish water at the mouth of the creek, which at its mouth opened out\r\ninto quite a little bay or inlet. They would take up a mouthful of earth\r\nfrom the bottom and let it wash through their mouths, keeping all the\r\nbits of food that happened to be in it. When one fish got a good place\r\nto feed the others swam around it and tried to get some of the food.\r\n\r\nRobinson watched his chance and slipped his net under a group, while\r\neach one was busy trying to get the best mouthful of mud. He drew up\r\nthree quite large fish, but just as he was about to lift them from the\r\nwater, one of the cords which bound the net to the poles broke and he\r\nsaw his catch fall back into the creek and dart away in the deepest\r\nwater. But Robinson was not to be discouraged. He soon mended his net\r\nand at last was successful. In a short time he drew out another catch of\r\ntwo fish.\r\n\r\nThese proved excellent food and were so abundant as to furnish Robinson\r\nwith all the fish he wanted as long as he stayed on the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nROBINSON BUILDS A BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson had wished for a boat many times. He wished to explore the\r\nshore of his island. He wanted to go clear around it so that he might\r\nsee it on every side. But he knew the work of making a boat would be\r\ngreat, if not wholly impossible.\r\n\r\nThe shaping of boards to build a boat with his rude tools was not to be\r\nthought of. He knew how the Indians made boats out of bark of trees. But\r\nhe saw that for his purpose so light a boat would not do. He finally\r\nremembered a second Indian way of making a boat by hollowing out a large\r\nlog. The forest was full of the boles of trees that had been blown down.\r\nBut they were far away from the shore. At first he did not think of this\r\nvery much. He had overcome so many difficulties that he thought, \"Never\r\nmind, I will get my boat to water, no matter where I make it, in some\r\nway.\" So he selected a tree trunk some distance from the bank of the\r\nlittle creek near his cave and began work.\r\n\r\nHe had first to burn out his log the proper length and hack it into boat\r\nshape with his stone tools. This was very slow and tedious work. He had\r\nto handle the fire with great care for there was always the danger of\r\nspoiling the shape of the slowly forming boat. Both ends must be\r\nsharpened, but one more than the other to form the prow or forward going\r\nend. After he had shaped his boat, he began hollowing it out. This he\r\ndid also by burning for the most part. He used the branches of pitch\r\nbearing trees for this purpose. But it was so slow. He worked at his\r\nboat all the time he could spare from his regular duties in attending to\r\nhis goats, his garden and his cave. He was always making his cave\r\nlarger. Every time he made a piece of furniture or stored away grain he\r\nmust make more room in his cave by digging away the earth and carrying\r\nit out. He had made a large strong wicker basket for this purpose.\r\n\r\nHe had had a vague idea that when he got his boat done he would dig a\r\ntrench back from the bank of the creek and thus float his boat. But he\r\nhad not thought it out clearly. \"Or anyway,\" he thought, \"I can in some\r\nway manage to roll it to the water.\" He must now actually plan to put\r\nsome of these ideas into effect. He first went over the ground and found\r\nthat to dig a trench from the water to the boat, so that the water would\r\ncome to the boat, he would have to dig it twenty feet deep. \"I can never\r\ndo this,\" he said, \"with my poor tools.\"\r\n\r\nHe next tried his rolling plan. But he had been so anxious to have a\r\nlarge boat that he had overlooked everything else. Try as hard as he\r\nmight he could not stir his boat from the spot. After many trials with\r\nthe longest levers he could handle, the boat still stuck fast. It would\r\nnot budge an inch. He at last gave it up. \"It will lie here,\" he\r\nthought, \"to remind me how foolish it is to attempt to do anything\r\nwithout first having thought it out carefully.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but to choose another tree trunk. This time he\r\nselected a much smaller one, and one that lay at the top of the little\r\nslope or incline from the bank of the creek. After another weary six\r\nmonths of work he had his second boat ready for launching. With a good\r\nstout lever he gave it a start, when it rolled quickly down into the\r\nwater. Robinson again wept for joy. Of all his projects this had cost\r\nhim the most work and pains and at last to see his plans successful\r\nfilled him with delight.\r\n\r\nThe next problem was how to make it go. He had no certain knowledge how\r\nfar it was around the island, but he knew it was farther than he wanted\r\nto row or paddle his boat. Yet he knew from the way the wind blew that\r\nhe could not always depend upon a sail to help him. He must become\r\nskillful in paddling his boat. A sail too would be very helpful at\r\ntimes. He imagined how pleasant it would be sitting in the boat sailing\r\nalong with a gentle wind. \"When the wind is favorable,\" he thought, \"I\r\nwill only have to steer with my paddle.\"\r\n\r\nSo he set about weaving a sail of his sisal fibre. To do this he had to\r\nmake a much larger loom than he had yet used. His sail must be at least\r\nfour feet square. He was now so skilled in weaving that this was soon\r\nfinished. He then made plenty of string, cord, and rope, put in a mast\r\nand was ready to sail. But he did not venture far away until he had\r\nspent weeks and weeks in learning to steer, sail, and paddle his boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS A SAILOR\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since Robinson had finished his boat he had been eager to make a\r\ntour of his island. He had indeed made a journey by land. But the deep\r\nforests and tangled vines made it very difficult to travel. His journeys\r\nhad shown him but a small part of the land. He wished to know all about\r\nthe land of which he, so far as he knew, was the sole master.\r\n\r\nHis first care was to fit up his boat with provisions. He made some\r\nlarge baskets in which to carry food and a large covered jar for water.\r\nThese he stored in the bow and the stern of his boat. He fastened his\r\nparasol on the stern for a shelter from the sun. He baked up a quantity\r\nof cakes or loaves of bread and packed them in his baskets. He had woven\r\nthese so carefully that they would almost hold water.\r\n\r\nAt last all was ready. It was on the sixth day of November in the sixth\r\nyear of his life on the island that Robinson hoisted his sail and set\r\nout upon this voyage of discovery. He had waited until the wind was\r\ngentle and blowing as far easterly as it does at that place. He scudded\r\nalong bravely, running with the land toward the East and North. All went\r\nwell until he came to a low reef or ledge of rocks running far out to\r\nsea in a north-easterly direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Robinson observed this he went on shore and climbed to a high point\r\nto see if it was safe to venture. He was afraid of hidden currents, or\r\nstreams of water. These might carry him away from the shore and prevent\r\nhim from getting around the point.\r\n\r\nHe did indeed observe that there was a current running out to sea past\r\nthe ledge, but he thought he could by careful paddling keep his boat\r\nfrom striking the rock. If he could once get beyond the ledge, the wind\r\nwould help him double or get around the point. Indeed the danger was\r\nthat the wind would blow him on to the rocks.\r\n\r\nHe waited for two days for a gentle wind. At last without sail he pushed\r\nhis boat into the current and was born swiftly seaward. He found the\r\ncurrent much stronger than he thought it would be. It rushed his frail\r\nboat on past the point of the rocks and out into the sea. Try as best he\r\nmight he could not change its course. He was steadily going out to sea.\r\nHe gave himself up for lost. He reproached himself for being so rash and\r\nfoolhardy as to trust his fortunes in so frail a craft. How dear at this\r\ntime seemed the island to him! The wind which he had depended on to help\r\nhim at this point had died down so that it was at the mercy of the\r\ncurrent. He kept urging his boat to the westward as much as possible,\r\nwith all his strength, hoping that a breeze would finally spring up.\r\n\r\nHe struggled on bravely until about noon. He had been carried out a\r\ngreat distance into the sea, but not so far as to lose sight of the\r\nland. All at once he felt the breeze freshening up. It caught his sail\r\nand soon his boat was cutting across the current. He did not have to go\r\nfar before he was free from it and making headway for the island, which\r\nhe reached about four o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nHe found himself on the northern shore of the island, but before long\r\nthe shore ran away to the southward again. He ran briskly along the west\r\nside until he found a little bay or cove. He determined to enter this,\r\ndraw up his boat on shore and make his way back home across the island\r\non foot. He was almost exhausted with his great labor and was worn out\r\nwith anxiety.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the arms of the cove he found a little creek entering\r\nthe sea. He paddled into this and found a good place to hide his boat.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Robinson was again on land he fell on his knees and with\r\ntears in his eyes thanked God for his deliverance. The island which had\r\nseemed to him a prison now seemed the fairest and dearest place in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHaving made his boat safe he started back toward his shelter. But he was\r\ntoo tired to go far. He soon came to a little grove of trees beneath\r\nwhich he laid himself down and soon was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine with what surprise Robinson was awakened out of his\r\nsleep by a voice calling his name. \"Robinson, Robinson Crusoe,\" it said,\r\n\"poor Robinson Crusoe! Where are you Robinson, where have you been?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe was so fast asleep that he did not at first rouse up entirely and\r\nthought he was dreaming. But the voice kept calling, \"Robinson,\r\nRobinson, poor Robinson Crusoe!\" He was greatly frightened and started\r\nup. But no sooner were his eyes opened than he saw his parrot sitting on\r\na branch of a tree. He knew at once the source of the voice.\r\n\r\nPolly had missed her master and was also exploring the island. It was a\r\npleasant surprise. She immediately flew to him and lit on his shoulder.\r\nShe showed in many ways how glad she was to see him and kept saying,\r\n\"Poor Robinson, poor Robinson Crusoe!\"\r\n\r\nRobinson remained here over night and the next morning made his way back\r\nto the shelter. Up to this time Robinson had never seen any dangerous\r\nanimals on the island. He had grown used to life there and went about\r\nwithout fear of animals. But as he was returning across a little\r\nopening, he saw a clump of palms in the centre of the opening, swaying\r\nabout. He did not at first see what caused this, but soon there was\r\nthrust out the head of a great serpent. Its jaws were open and its eyes\r\nwere fixed on a poor terrified little rabbit. The rabbit seemed rooted\r\nto the spot. It could not stir a muscle and was soon caught in the folds\r\nof the great snake.\r\n\r\nThis sight made Robinson greatly afraid. He wanted to rush to the rescue\r\nof the rabbit, but what could he do against such a foe? He resolved in\r\nthe future to keep a more careful watch and always to sleep in his\r\nbower.\r\n\r\nRobinson had enough of exploring for some time. He was contented to\r\nremain at home. He made many things he needed. He had saved all the\r\nskins of the goats he had killed for meat and all that had died from any\r\ncause. These he made into rugs for his bed. He kept at his loom too, for\r\nhe was anxious to weave enough of his coarse cloth to make him a suit of\r\nclothes. He learned how to braid mats and rugs out of his fibre, and\r\nfinally replaced his awkward hat and parasol with others braided very\r\nskillfully from the long grasses that grew so abundantly in the marshy\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that Robinson was now able to make or weave out of his\r\nfibre was a hammock. He had slept all this time on a bed made of poles\r\nlaid lengthwise and thickly covered with the skins of goats and rabbits.\r\n\r\nNow he could have a comfortable place to sleep. He did not stop until he\r\nhad made two. One was for the bower and the other was for use\r\nout-of-doors. When his work was done in the evening or in the heat of\r\nthe midday he would lie in it at full length under the shade of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson could not forget his boat. It seemed a companion. \"It may be\r\nthe means of my escape from this place,\" he thought. He took frequent\r\njourneys across the island to where his little boat lay in the cove. He\r\nwould start out in the morning and walk over to the west side of the\r\nisland, take his boat and have a pleasant little sail. He always\r\nreturned home before dark, for to tell the truth, Robinson was a coward.\r\nHe was as timid as a hare. He was afraid of everything and spent many\r\nnights without sleep because of fear.\r\n\r\nIt was while on one of his visits to his boat that Robinson made a\r\ndiscovery that changed his whole life. It happened one day, about noon,\r\nwhen he was going toward his boat that he, with great surprise, saw the\r\nprint of a man's naked foot on the shore in the sand. He stood like one\r\nrooted to the ground. He could not move, so great was his surprise and\r\nfear. He listened, looked around, but could hear and see nothing. He\r\nwent up to a little hill to look further but nothing was in sight.\r\nThere was but the one footprint. There was no doubt about it, there it\r\nwas, foot, toes, heel and every part of a foot. Robinson tried to think\r\nhow it might have gotten there, but he could not. It was a mystery. He\r\nwas greatly afraid and started at once for his shelter. He ran like one\r\npursued. At every little way he would look behind to see if anyone was\r\nfollowing him.\r\n\r\nNever a frightened rabbit ran to his hiding place with more terror than\r\nRobinson ran to his cave. He did not sleep that night for fear and\r\nremained in his shelter for three days, never venturing out. But his\r\nfood was growing short and his goats needed to be milked. He finally\r\nwith a thousand wild fancies forced himself to go about his duties.\r\n\r\nBut he could not get the footprint out of his mind. He spent many sad\r\nand fearful days thinking about it. \"How could it have gotten there?\r\nWhose was it? Was the owner savage or not? What did he want on the\r\nisland?\" were some of the questions that haunted him.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" he thought one day, \"I just imagined I saw a footprint, or\r\nperhaps it was one of my own that I have made when going to sail my\r\nboat.\" He took courage at this and began to go about the island again.\r\nBut he went in great fear, always looking behind him. He was always\r\nready to run at the first sign of danger. He had made himself a large,\r\nstrong, new bow and plenty of arrows. He carried these in a quiver he\r\nhad made from his cloth. He fashioned too a sharp-pointed, lance-like\r\nweapon which he hurled with a kind of sling. In his belt he carried some\r\nnew sharpened stone knives. He had found a better kind of rock out of\r\nwhich to make his knives. It resembled glass and could be brought to a\r\nfine, keen edge.\r\n\r\nArmed thus, he began to have more confidence. He had a strong desire to\r\nsee the footprint again and make up his mind about it. He wished to\r\nmeasure it. In this way he could tell certainly whether it was a chance\r\nprint of his own foot or not. So, after a few days, he again ventured\r\nacross the island. Alas, on measuring the print it was much larger than\r\nhis own! There could no longer be any doubt that it belonged to someone\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nAgain great fear fell on poor Robinson. He shook with cold and fright.\r\nHe resolved to make himself more secure against attack.\r\n\r\nHe cut and carried willow stakes and set them in a thick hedge around in\r\nfront of his shelter. This was outside the first and enclosed it. In a\r\nseason or two these had grown to such a height as to shut out all view\r\nof his home from sight to one coming to it from the front.\r\n\r\nHis flock of goats gave him many troubled thoughts. His goats were his\r\ngreatest treasure. From them he obtained without trouble his meat, his\r\nmilk and butter.\r\n\r\n\"What if they were discovered and killed or carried away?\" He resolved\r\nto divide his herd into three parts and secrete these in separate fenced\r\npastures in different parts of the island. His herd of goats now\r\nnumbered twenty-five. He made thorough search about the island for the\r\nmost secluded and best hidden spots where he could fence in a pasture.\r\n\r\nOne day as he was exploring on the west side of the island to find\r\nanother open space for a goat field, he thought he spied away out to sea\r\na boat. He looked long and anxiously and yet he was not sure that it was\r\na boat he saw. But how easy, thought Robinson, for the people of the\r\nmainland, which must be at no great distance to the westward, to come\r\nacross to this side of the island in fair weather. He thought too, how\r\nfortunate he was to have been cast on the east side of the island. For\r\nthere he had his shelter in the very safest part.\r\n\r\nAs he was coming down from a hill where he had gone to get a better view\r\nof the sea he made another discovery. About him everywhere at the foot\r\nof the hill were bones of all kinds. Near by too, were charcoal and\r\nashes. There could be no mistake, the place was visited by human beings.\r\nThese were very likely savages. Everything showed that they came for the\r\npurpose of feasting and not for plundering. It was very likely that they\r\nneither sought anything on the island nor expected it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATCHING FOR SAVAGES]\r\n\r\nThis thought greatly relieved Robinson. He returned home in a very\r\nthankful and composed state of mind. He had now been on the island\r\nalmost eighteen years and had not been discovered. Yet, no doubt, the\r\nisland had been visited many times by the savages since he had been\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn a short time his fear of discovery wore off and he began to live just\r\nas he did before his discovery.\r\n\r\nHe took, however, greater precaution against surprise. He always carried\r\nhis bow and arrows, his lance and knives. He was also very careful about\r\nmaking a great smoke from his fire. He burned a great quantity of wood\r\nin a pit and made charcoal. With this material he had a fine fire with a\r\nvery little smoke. Every day also he went to the top of the hill back of\r\nhis shelter in order to discover if possible the approach of savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE LANDING OF THE SAVAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother year passed by, Robinson longed more and more to get away from\r\nthe island. Year after year he had hoped and watched in vain for a\r\npassing ship. Every day he would scan the waters that held him prisoner\r\nfor the welcome sight of a sail. He had been disappointed. Now his only\r\nhope was to escape to the mainland in some way. He feared the savages.\r\nHe had heard stories of their being cannibals. But if they could come to\r\nhis island in their canoes against the prevailing wind, why could he not\r\nget to the mainland with it in his favor?\r\n\r\nStrange as it may be, Robinson began to wish for the return of the\r\nsavages. He hoped to watch them at a distance and find out something\r\nabout their customs. More especially he wished that he might capture one\r\nof them. He had two reasons for this. In the first place he would have a\r\ncompanion. He pictured fondly how he would teach him gentle manners and\r\nthe English speech. And, too, the companion would be able to help him.\r\nBesides this he longed above all to know more of the mainland and\r\nwhether it would be safe to go there. He wanted to find out in what kind\r\nof boat they made the voyage. He thought that if he had such a person he\r\nwould have someone to show him the way to reach the land.\r\n\r\nThe more he thought, the more anxious he became to see the savages on\r\nthe island. He thought so much about it by day that he dreamed about it\r\nat night. One night he dreamed that the savages came, drew their boats\r\nupon the shore and began to prepare their feast. As he watched them one\r\nof their number broke away from his fellows and came straight toward his\r\nhiding-place. Robinson thought he rushed out, drove away those that\r\nfollowed the fleeing man and rescued him. This dream made a deep\r\nimpression upon him and made him await the coming of the savages with\r\ngreat hopes and eagerness.\r\n\r\nIt was more than eighteen months after he had formed this plan of\r\ncapturing one of the savages before the savages made their appearance.\r\nRobinson was surprised one morning to see no less than five canoes drawn\r\nup on the shore at a point on his side of the island about two miles\r\nbelow his shelter, to the south. The people that had come in them were\r\non shore and out of sight. Robinson went back to his shelter to make his\r\nplans. He made up his mind that he would be foolish to attack them.\r\nThere must be twenty-five or thirty of them. He finally went to a point\r\nwhere he could see farther inland and soon caught sight of a crowd of\r\nabout thirty savages. They were naked and dancing around and around in a\r\ncircle. All the while they were singing and making hideous noises. There\r\nwas a fire in the center of the ring of savages. \"They are cooking their\r\nfeast,\" thought Robinson. \"Maybe I can surprise them while they eat and\r\nrush in and seize one.\" But this seemed too great a risk to run. He had\r\nno weapons but his bow and arrows, his lance and knife. What could he do\r\nagainst so great a number?\r\n\r\nBut fortune favored his plans. As he gazed at them from his safe\r\ndistance he saw one of their number break away from the rest and run\r\nwith utmost speed directly toward his hiding-place. At once two other\r\nsavages pursued him. They had no weapons but clubs. They ran with great\r\nswiftness, but the man in front was steadily gaining ground.\r\n\r\nRobinson now to tell the truth was dreadfully frightened to see the\r\nsavage run directly toward him and his shelter. He kept his place,\r\nhowever, and watched the race. The man running away ran along the shore\r\nand would soon come to the little creek that emptied into the sea below\r\nhis home. Robinson saw that the savage would have to swim this to\r\nescape. He ran down thither and concealed himself behind a tree and\r\nwaited for the fugitive to come up. As he did so, the fleeing savage\r\nplunged in and swam across with a few strong strokes. When he was well\r\non the bank, Robinson presented himself and made signs to him to come to\r\nhim and he would help him. The savage was at first almost overcome with\r\nastonishment and fright, for Robinson presented a very unusual sight.\r\nThe savage at once ran to him and fell down at his feet. Indeed so great\r\nwas his fright and distress that he placed one of Robinson's feet upon\r\nhis neck in sign that he yielded up his life into his hands. Robinson\r\nraised him up and motioned for him to take the lance and help in defence\r\nagainst the men, now coming up. They hid behind trees and waited for\r\nthem to swim across the stream. But this they did not do. When they\r\nreached the creek, they could see nothing of their runaway. They very\r\nslowly turned and went back to their companions.\r\n\r\nRobinson was well content not to let them know that there was any one on\r\nthe island. He feared they might return and destroy his shelter and\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nRobinson took the savage to his shelter and gave him bread and raisins\r\nto eat, and a cup of water to drink. He was very hungry and ate\r\ngreedily. After he had eaten, Robinson made signs for him to lie down\r\nand sleep, for the Indian was nearly tired out with his long and swift\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nHe was a handsome fellow of his race. His limbs were large, straight and\r\nstrong. He had a good face. His hair was long and black, his forehead\r\nhigh, and his eyes bright. His skin was not black, but of an olive\r\ncolor. His teeth were fine set and as white as ivory.\r\n\r\nHe slept about an hour; when he awoke he came running to Robinson and\r\nagain made signs to him that he was his slave. \"You saved my life,\" he\r\nseemed to say, \"and now I will serve you.\" Robinson named him Friday at\r\nonce, for that was the day on which the great event of his escape had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nRobinson's next care was to fit him out with some clothing. He had by\r\nthis time several suits made of his coarse cloth. He soon had Friday\r\ndressed in one of the old ones, with a straw or braided hat on his head.\r\nHe did not think it safe to allow Friday to sleep with him in the bower.\r\nHe made a little tent for him inside the enclosure. This was covered\r\nwith goatskins and made a very good protection from both heat and rain.\r\n\r\nRobinson took care to keep all his knives and weapons near him in the\r\nbower. But his fears that Friday might harm him were unfounded. Friday\r\nfrom the first was faithful to his master. He was sweet and obedient in\r\nall things. He seemed to look upon Robinson with the love of a child for\r\nits father and never tired of serving him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\nROBINSON AS A TEACHER\r\n\r\n(From Robinson's Diary)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I began to consider that having now two mouths to feed instead of one, I\r\nmust provide more ground for my harvest and plant a larger quantity of\r\ncorn than I used to plant. So I marked out a larger piece of land and\r\nbegan to fence it in. Friday worked not only very willingly but very\r\nhard. I told him that it was for corn to make more bread because he was\r\nnow with me. He let me know that he was grateful for my kindness and\r\nwould work much harder if I would tell him what to do.\r\n\r\n\"This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.\r\nFriday began to talk pretty well and understood the names of almost all\r\nthe things that I called for and of all the places which I wished to\r\nsend him. I was careful to teach him all the things I knew. I showed him\r\nhow to plant and harvest corn, how to gather fibre, spin yarn and to\r\nweave it into cloth. He learned these things quickly and became very\r\nskillful in making pots. He knew something about this because at home he\r\nhad seen the women make them. He ornamented them with figures of birds\r\nand flowers. I taught him about the true God. But as for writing he\r\ncould never do much with this. I had no books and could not make him\r\nunderstand the importance of writing. He began to talk a great deal to\r\nme. This delighted me very much. I began to love him exceedingly. He was\r\nso very honest and faithful.\r\n\r\n\"After I had taught him English I tried one day to find out whether he\r\nhad any wish to return to his own country and as I talked to him about\r\nit I saw his face light up with joy and his eye sparkle. From this I had\r\nno doubt but that Friday would like to be in his own country again. This\r\nfor a time made me sad, to think how eagerly he would leave me to be\r\namong his savage friends. 'Do you not wish you were back in your own\r\ncountry, Friday?' I said to him one day. 'Yes,' he said, 'I be much O\r\nglad to be back in my country.' 'What would you do there,' said I?\r\n'Would you turn wild again and do as the savages do?' He shook his head\r\nand said very gravely, 'No, no, Friday tell them to live good. He tell\r\nthem to plant corn and live like white mans.'\r\n\r\n\"One day when we were on the top of a hill on the west side of the\r\nisland, Friday suddenly began to jump and dance about in great glee. I\r\nasked him what the matter was. 'O, joy, O glad,' he said; 'there my\r\ncountry!' The air was so clear that from this place, as I had before\r\ndiscovered, land could be distinctly seen looking westward.\r\n\r\n\"I asked him how far it was from our island to his country and whether\r\ntheir canoes were ever lost in coming and going. He said that there was\r\nno danger. No canoes were ever wrecked and that it was easy to get back\r\nand forth. I asked him many things about his people and country. He told\r\nme that away to the west of his country there lived 'white mans like\r\nyou.' I thought these must be the people of Central America, and asked\r\nhim how I might come from this island and get among these white men. He\r\nmade me understand that I must have a large boat as big as two canoes.\r\n\r\n\"I resolved at once to begin to make a boat large enough for us to pass\r\nover to the land we could see lying to the west and if possible to go on\r\nto the white man's country Friday told me about. It took us nearly two\r\nmonths to make our boat and rig her out with sails, masts, rudder, and\r\nanchor. We had to weave our sails and twist our rope. We burned out the\r\ncanoe from a large fallen log. We used a great stone tied securely to\r\nthe end of a strong rope for an anchor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON AND FRIDAY SAILING THE BOAT]\r\n\r\n\"When we had the boat in the water, Friday showed great skill in rowing\r\nor paddling it. He had managed boats ever since he was old enough, but\r\nhe did not know how to handle a sail or rudder. He learned very quickly,\r\nhowever, to sail and steer the boat and soon was perfectly at home in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"We made our boat safe by keeping it in the little cove at the mouth of\r\nthe creek. I had Friday to fetch rocks and build a dock or place for\r\nlanding. But the rainy season was now coming on and we must wait for\r\nfair weather. In the meantime I planned to lay by such quantities of\r\nfood as we would need to take along.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nANOTHER SHIPWRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening Robinson sat in his shelter thinking of his plans to escape\r\nto Friday's country. He was sad. For, after all, this place was very\r\ndear to him. It was the only home he had. Had he not made everything\r\nwith his own hands? It was doubly dear to him on this account. He\r\nthought how it would grieve him to leave his goats, his fields, and the\r\nmany comforts he had here.\r\n\r\nHe had been telling Friday of his home in New York. He told him of the\r\ngreat city, and of its many wonderful sights. He told him of his country\r\nand people, of his flag and its history. All these things brought back\r\nmemories of his boyhood and he wondered what changes had come in his\r\nlong absence. Friday, with wonderful intelligence, listened to all\r\nRobinson told him. He was delighted in hearing Robinson tell of the\r\nwonders of the great world, for he had never known anything about it. As\r\nthey talked Robinson noticed the approach of a storm. The sky was\r\ngetting black with clouds. The winds were blowing a hurricane. The waves\r\nwere coming in mountain high. It reminded him of the eventful night now\r\ntwenty-five years ago when his ship was tossed up on the shore like an\r\negg shell and broken to pieces.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a sound that made Robinson start from his seat with\r\nthe wildest alarm. Was it the sound of a cannon from the ocean or the\r\nterrible crash and roar of the water on the rocks of the coast? There it\r\nis again; it is a cannon! Some ship is in distress! This is its signal!\r\nRobinson ran out and down to the shore with Friday at his heels.\r\n\r\n\"O master!\" said Friday, \"can we not help? If they only knew the island\r\nwas here and how to steer into the harbor beyond the point of land on\r\nthe south.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson was so excited that he scarcely knew what he was doing. He ran\r\nup and down the shore calling wildly, but the awful roar of the sea and\r\nwind drowned his cries. Suddenly his thoughts came to him. \"Quick,\r\nFriday, get some fire in a pot. We will run to the point, gather grass\r\nand wood, and make a fire there. Maybe we can guide them into the\r\nharbor.\"\r\n\r\nThey soon had a great beacon light sending its welcome greeting far over\r\nthe sea. The pilot of the ship saw it and steered his ship nearer and\r\nnearer. Robinson was ready to shout for joy as the ship seemed about to\r\nmake the harbor. The ship had her sails torn in shreds and her rudder\r\nbroken. It was hard to steer her in such a gale. On rounding the point,\r\nshe was blown on the rocks. With a frightful crash which could be heard\r\nabove the din of the storm she struck and held fast. Robinson could hear\r\nthe cries of the men and the orders of the officers. They were trying to\r\nget boats ready to put off, but such was the confusion of the storm and\r\nthe enormous waves breaking over the deck that it could not be done\r\nquickly. Before the men could get a boat into the sea, and get into it,\r\nthe ship gave a lurch to one side as though about to sink. All the men\r\njumped for one boat. It was overburdened. The wind tossed it about. The\r\nsea soon filled it and it went down and all were lost.\r\n\r\nRobinson and Friday remained on the shore all night. They watched to see\r\nif they could not help some poor sailor that might cling to a plank and\r\nbe blown on shore. They saw no one.\r\n\r\nAt last they lay down, but they could not sleep. Many times they sprang\r\nup and ran about for fear that some poor fellow would need their help.\r\nAt last morning came. The storm ceased. Robinson and Friday searched\r\neverywhere for the bodies of the sailors, but could find none. But the\r\nwind had blown the ship in plain view, and into shallow waters. It was\r\nlying on the bottom with more than half its bulk out of the water. The\r\nmasts were gone. It was a sad sight. No human being could be seen on it.\r\n\r\nThey were now rejoiced that they had their boat ready. \"Let us take it,\"\r\nsaid Robinson \"and go out to the ship. It may be some person is still on\r\nthe unfortunate ship.\" They were soon by the ship's side. They rowed\r\naround it until they saw a rope hanging down from the deck. Robinson\r\nseized this and clambered up. Friday tied the boat fast, and followed.\r\nRobinson opened the door leading from the deck into the ship and went\r\ndown. He searched in all the cabins, and knocked at all the doors. He\r\ncalled, but all was still. When he was satisfied that every person on\r\nboard had been drowned he wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nFriday stood there with open and staring eyes. He looked and looked. He\r\nwas astonished at the large ship and at the wonderful things before him.\r\nThey were in the cabin where the passengers had been. There stood\r\ntrunks under the benches and clothes hung on the hooks on the wall. One\r\ntrunk was open. In it were telescopes through which the travelers had\r\nlooked at the land. Robinson saw also paper, pens, pen-holders and ink.\r\nBooks were also near by. Robinson first took a thick book. It was the\r\nBible, out of which his mother had so often taught him. Then they came\r\nto the sailors' cabin. There hung muskets and swords and bags of shot\r\nand cartridges. Then they went to the work-room. There were saws,\r\nhammers, spades, shovels, chisels, nails, bottles, and pails, knives and\r\nforks. And something more, over which Robinson was most glad, matches.\r\nAt last they came into the store-room. There lay bags of flour and\r\nbarley, teas, lentils, beans and sugar. Then Robinson embraced Friday in\r\nhis great joy and said to him, \"How rich we are!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\nSAVING THINGS FROM THE SHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Robinson had looked through the ship he began to plan the way to\r\nget the tools and things he most wanted on shore. He and Friday first\r\ncarried everything together that he wanted to take on shore. When they\r\nhad done this, he found he had the following things. Robinson stood\r\neverything together that he needed most.\r\n\r\n    1. A case of nails and screws.\r\n    2. Two iron axes and several hatchets.\r\n    3. A saw.\r\n    4. A small case of planes, tongs, augers, files, chisels, etc.\r\n    5. A third case with iron brackets, hooks, hinges, etc.\r\n    6. A case of matches.\r\n    7. A barrel of gunpowder.\r\n    8. Two muskets and a pistol.\r\n    9. Several swords.\r\n    10. A bag of cartridges.\r\n    11. A large sail cloth and some rope.\r\n    12. A telescope.\r\n\r\nBy means of the ship's ropes, Robinson let everything down into his\r\nboat. He himself took the Bible and then they rowed to the shore, and\r\nunloaded the boat. Everything was put into the bower where rain could\r\nnot harm it. By the time they had this done, night was coming on and\r\nthey decided to do no more that day, but wait until the next day.\r\n\r\n\"We must work fast,\" said Robinson. \"The first storm is likely to break\r\nthe ship in pieces and destroy everything in it.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning early they ate a hastily prepared breakfast and were\r\noff to the boat. Neither Robinson nor Friday stopped for their noonday\r\nlunch. \"A storm is brewing,\" said Robinson, \"the air is calm, the sky is\r\novercast with clouds, the heat is oppressive. We must hurry.\" With the\r\nutmost diligence they rowed back and forth all day. They made nine\r\ntrips. They had now on shore a surprising quantity of all kinds of\r\ntools, goods and weapons. They had all kinds of ware to use in the\r\nkitchen, clothes, and food. Robinson prized a little four-wheeled wagon\r\nand a whetstone.\r\n\r\nBut in looking over his stores, Robinson suddenly discovered that he had\r\nno needles or thread. They went at once to procure these important\r\narticles. In looking for needles and thread, Robinson found a small\r\ntrunk full of money and valuable stones. There were diamonds, rubies,\r\npearls, and much gold. Robinson pushed it to one side. \"What can I do\r\nwith riches on this island? I would give them all for some needles and\r\nthread,\" he said to Friday. But on second thought he took the trunk and\r\nits contents along with him to his cave. For in the trunk were also\r\nletters and writings. \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"these tell to whom the\r\nvaluables belong and I can return them some time.\"\r\n\r\nRobinson at last found a case containing everything one could need with\r\nwhich to cut and sew cloth. There were scissors, thread, needles,\r\nthimbles, tapes, and buttons. But now the wind was rising and they must\r\nhurry. They were nearly ready for departure. They were passing through a\r\npart of the ship not before visited. They were surprised to hear a sound\r\ncoming from a room whose door was kept shut by a heap of stuff that had\r\nbeen thrown against it by the violent pitching of the ship in the storm.\r\nRobinson and Friday cleared away the rubbish and were surprised to find\r\na dog almost drowned. He was so weak from want of food that his cries\r\ncould be heard a short distance only. Robinson took him tenderly in his\r\narms and carried him to the boat, while Friday carried the sewing case\r\nand the trunk.\r\n\r\nThe wind was now blowing a gale. A few yards from the ship they were in\r\ngreat danger. Robinson grasped the rudder and made Friday stand ready to\r\ncut away the mast in case they found the wind too strong. With the\r\ngreatest difficulty they finally made the little cove at the mouth of\r\nthe creek and were soon landed with their precious cargo. The next\r\nmorning they eagerly searched the waters for the ship. Not even their\r\nfield glasses could reveal anything of it. Some planks, a mast, and\r\nparts of a small boat were blown on shore. All else had disappeared.\r\n\r\nRobinson set to work at once to make a door for his bower out of the\r\npine wood cast up by the waves. How easy the work proceeded with saws,\r\nhammers, augers, squares, planes, nails, hinges, and screws! With the\r\nwagon too, Friday could now gather his corn quickly and easily, or haul\r\nin a great quantity of grapes to dry for raisins.\r\n\r\nFriday had never seen a gun. He did not know the use of firearms. The\r\nmuskets that Robinson had brought from the ship were a great mystery to\r\nhim. Robinson showed him their use. He showed how they could defend\r\nthemselves. He told Friday that these weapons would kill at a distance.\r\nHe took some powder and touched a match to it. Friday was greatly\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON SHOWING FRIDAY HOW TO SHOOT]\r\n\r\nRobinson then proceeded to load the gun. He put in some powder, a ball\r\nof lead or bullet. Then at the hammer he placed a little cap which gave\r\na flash when struck. This ignited the powder. When all was in readiness\r\nRobinson bade Friday follow him. They went slowly out into the forest\r\nalong the stream. Soon Robinson espied a rabbit sitting under a clump of\r\ngrass. Robinson raised his gun, took careful aim, pressed the trigger.\r\nThere was a flash and loud report and there lay the rabbit dead. But\r\nFriday, too, was lying on the ground. He had fainted from astonishment\r\nand fright. Robinson dropped his gun and raised the poor fellow up to a\r\nsitting position. He quickly recovered. He ran to get the rabbit. He\r\nexamined it carefully. Robinson at last pointed out the hole the bullet\r\nhad made and the mystery of the way the rabbit was killed was solved.\r\n\r\nRobinson had lived alone so long that he had learned to love every\r\nliving creature on the island. He never harmed anything except when he\r\nneeded food. He had lived so quietly that the birds and animals did not\r\nfear him. They lived near his shelter and seemed to know him.\r\n\r\nRobinson was delighted with his new tools and weapons. But they reminded\r\nhim of home. Nothing that he had seen in all the time he had been on the\r\nisland so turned his thoughts toward home and friends. Robinson would\r\nsit for hours thinking of the past and making plans for the future. He\r\nwas homesick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF THE SAVAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson now renewed his plans for escaping from the island to Friday's\r\ncountry. They first rebuilt their boat with their new tools. They\r\nhollowed out the center till the sides were thin toward the top. They\r\nshaped her sides and keel. They made her prow sharp so that she would\r\ncut the water easily. They made a new mast, strong and tall and shapely.\r\nThey made larger and stronger sails and ropes. They made two pairs of\r\nextra oars. They made boxes and cupboards in the prow and stern for\r\nkeeping their fresh water and provisions. Friday's eyes sparkled with\r\njoy when it was done. He hoped he would now be able to return to his own\r\nisland and parents. Robinson noticed his joy and asked him, \"Do you want\r\nto return to your own people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Friday, \"very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you trust yourself in this boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Friday.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said his master, \"you may have it and start home when you\r\nplease.\" \"Yes, Master, but you come too, my people will not hurt you.\"\r\nRobinson resolved to venture over to Friday's land with him.\r\n\r\nBut before their preparations were complete the rainy season of our fall\r\nset in. They resolved to wait until the weather was settled and as soon\r\nas the rainy season was over to set out. They ran their boat well up\r\ninto the creek and covered it over with a large tarpaulin made of\r\nsail-cloth obtained from the ship.\r\n\r\nRobinson had now been on the island twenty-seven years. For the last\r\nthree years he had lived happily with his companion Friday. Every year\r\nin September, Robinson celebrated the day his life was saved and he was\r\nthrown up on the island. Robinson celebrated it this year with more than\r\nthe usual thankfulness. He thought that it would be his last anniversary\r\non the island.\r\n\r\nOne morning, Friday had gone to the beach to find a turtle. Soon he came\r\nrunning back out of breath. \"O Master,\" he cried, \"they are coming, they\r\nare coming to take me prisoner!\" He was trembling with fright.\r\n\r\n\"We must take our guns and defend ourselves,\" said Robinson. \"But we\r\nwill not kill anyone unless they attack us.\" This quieted Friday. They\r\nloaded four muskets and three pistols. Robinson put the pistols in his\r\nbelt, where he also fastened a sword. He gave Friday a pistol and a\r\nmusket, for Friday had learned to shoot well. Besides Friday carried a\r\nbag of powder and bullets. Robinson took his field glasses and saw\r\ntwenty-one savages with two prisoners. The prisoners were bound and\r\nlying on the ground. This was a war party celebrating a victory with a\r\nfeast. They probably intended to kill their prisoners. \"We must save the\r\nlives of those men,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\nThe savages this time had landed quite near Robinson's shelter, not more\r\nthan a half mile below the creek's mouth. Soon he and Friday started\r\noff. Robinson commanded Friday to follow quietly and not to speak or\r\nshoot.\r\n\r\n\"We will surprise them and give them a good scare,\" said Robinson.\r\n\r\nWhen yet a considerable distance away they could hear the savages\r\nyelling and screaming. Some of them were dancing their war dance. Their\r\nfaces and bodies were painted to make them look terrible to their\r\nenemies. They were dancing around their prisoners with hideous cries and\r\ngestures. They could now see the prisoners plainly. One had a beard and\r\nwas plainly a white man. Robinson was surprised and determined to save\r\nhim at all risks.\r\n\r\n\"Get your gun ready to fire,\" he said to Friday, \"and when I say the\r\nword let us run forward yelling and firing our guns over their heads.\r\nThis will fill them with such fright that they will take to their heels\r\nand boats and get away as soon as possible. In the scramble and\r\nconfusion we will rush in and rescue the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan did not please Friday at all. His savage blood was up and he\r\nwanted to kill all he could. \"Let's fire on them,\" he said. \"Let's kill\r\nall but the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Robinson, \"it's always wrong to take life unless it\r\ncannot be avoided to save one's own. Let's try my plan first.\"\r\n\r\nWith great reluctance Friday consented. At a signal from Robinson they\r\nrushed forward, and when in plain sight they fired off their muskets in\r\nthe air. If the ground had suddenly exploded beneath their feet there\r\ncould have been no more confusion, astonishment, and fright. A few took\r\nto their heels. Others lay as if dead. They had swooned from fright. But\r\nas Robinson came up they jumped to their feet and pushed into the boats,\r\nleaving the prisoners behind. Robinson and Friday still rushed forward\r\nand fired their remaining loaded guns and pistols in the air. The\r\nsavages made all haste to get into their boats and push off. Soon they\r\nwere well out to sea, paddling rapidly for the west. Robinson reloaded\r\nhis arms and gave them a farewell volley, but not a soul was killed or\r\neven wounded. This gave Robinson great pleasure. He had accomplished his\r\npurpose without bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThey could now turn to the prisoners. Robinson ran back to them and\r\nquickly cut their ropes. Robinson asked the white man who he was, but\r\nthe man was too weak to answer. Robinson gave him a piece of bread.\r\n\r\nThe fear of death being removed, the white man soon grew stronger. When\r\nFriday came running back from watching the boats and saw the savage that\r\nhad been a prisoner he gave a loud yell. He threw his arms around the\r\nman, kissed him and laughed and cried for joy. He put his head on his\r\nbreast and hugged him again and again. Robinson was greatly surprised\r\nand puzzled. He asked Friday what his actions meant. But so intent was\r\nFriday that he got no answer.\r\n\r\nAt last Friday recovered far enough from his great joy to say with face\r\nbeaming with delight, \"O, Master, this man is my dear father.\" They at\r\nonce began a long conversation, each one told his story. Suddenly Friday\r\njumped up and said, \"How foolish I am, I have not thought to give my\r\nfather anything to eat and drink. He must be nearly starved.\" And away\r\nhe ran toward the shelter and was soon back with food and water to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRIDAY AND HIS FATHER]\r\n\r\nRobinson learned through Friday from his father that the white man was a\r\nSpaniard, that he had been captured by the tribe that had a battle with\r\nFriday's people. The Spaniard was one of sixteen men that had been saved\r\nby Friday's people from a wrecked ship. So weak were the prisoners that\r\nthey could not walk to the shelter. Robinson and Friday made a litter\r\nand carried them one after the other. When once there, Friday prepared\r\nsome rich rice soup. The prisoners ate heartily and in a few days were\r\nstrong enough to go about the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\nDELIVERANCE AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday had not forgotten the plan for going to his home. He would often\r\nmention it and spent hours talking about it during the long rainy\r\nseason. But now that the Spaniard and Friday's father had come into the\r\nfamily, Robinson felt he must change his plans a little. He felt very\r\nsorry for the Spaniards left in Friday's country. They did not have\r\nenough to eat and were sick and sad besides. He talked the matter over\r\nwith the Spaniard many times. They at last planned to send for them. The\r\nSpaniard and Friday's father were to go. Robinson was for doing it at\r\nonce. But the Spaniard advised delay. \"How can we get food for ourselves\r\nand fifteen others? Your small store will soon be used up,\" he argued.\r\nRobinson at last saw that this difficulty must be overcome. There was\r\njust one thing to do, and this, to delay their departure until a new\r\ncrop of corn could be raised. This would take six months.\r\n\r\nBut at it they went. The four men could do much and work fast. They\r\ncleared more ground and planted all the seed corn they could spare from\r\ntheir store. Besides this they sowed about twelve bushels of barley they\r\nhad gotten in the ship.\r\n\r\nThe care for so much crop, its harvesting and storing away, kept them\r\nvery busy for the season. Robinson not only did this, but also increased\r\nhis flock of goats by catching kids and putting them in his pasture. He\r\ngathered, too, all the grapes he could and dried them on the branches of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the harvesting season, they made ready their boat. They\r\nfilled it with all the bread it could well carry. They put in raisins\r\nand fresh water. Robinson gave the Spaniard and Friday's father each a\r\nmusket and plenty of powder and bullets. Now, all was ready. Friday gave\r\nhis father a loving farewell. He stretched out his arms towards him as\r\nthe boat moved away. The Spaniard and Robinson waved their hats and they\r\nwere off.\r\n\r\nThey promised to be back in eight or nine days. Robinson and Friday made\r\nevery preparation to receive the guests. They were to have a home not\r\nfar from Robinson's built of poles, and thatched with the long marsh\r\ngrasses, like Robinson's bower. There was no need of hiding or\r\ndefending it. It did not take long to fix it up.\r\n\r\nEight days had now passed since the boat had left. Friday could hardly\r\nrestrain himself longer. He watched the ocean all the time. He would go\r\nto the top of the hill with the field glasses every hour during the day\r\nto catch a first glimpse of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON AND FRIDAY SEE A SHIP]\r\n\r\nOn the ninth day, as Friday put up his glasses to search the waters he\r\ndropped them with a yell of surprise. He tore down the hill with the\r\nutmost speed and rushed up to Robinson as one gone mad. \"Look, look, O\r\nMaster!\" he cried, \"a big ship; a big ship way out on the sea!\" Robinson\r\ntook the glasses, and sure enough, there within hailing distance was a\r\nlarge ocean going vessel. Robinson was overcome with excitement.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-eight years his aching eyes had scanned the waters for this\r\nwelcome sight. His joy was boundless. The ship looked like an American.\r\nYes, there floated the American flag! How welcome a sight to Robinson.\r\nHe could not utter a word. Tears filled his eyes and streamed down his\r\ncheeks. He would soon have news from home. He ran to the shore and shot\r\noff a gun to attract the attention of those on board. He heard answering\r\nshots at once.\r\n\r\nSoon a boat was lowered and in it three men rowed toward the shore. It\r\nwas the captain himself and two sailors. The captain was astonished to\r\nfind a man in the lonely island. Robinson told how it all had happened\r\nand how he would like to return home. To his unspeakable delight the\r\ncaptain told him that the ship was bound for New York and would take him\r\nalong free of charge, but he must leave that day. The ship could not be\r\ndelayed any longer. Of course Robinson would go. Friday was beside\r\nhimself with grief. He did not want to be left behind alone. He did not\r\nknow that the Spaniards would ever return. Something might happen to\r\nthem on the sea. But before the eventful day the Spaniards landed. They\r\nbrought word that Friday's father had died after his return home. Friday\r\nwas thrown into a fit of grief at the news. He wept and repeated over\r\nand over his praise of the good man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\n\r\nROBINSON AT HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with a sad heart that Robinson made ready to leave. Every\r\nfamiliar place seemed now doubly dear to him. He went from one to\r\nanother with tears in his eyes. Here lay his home. Here were his fields,\r\nhis crops and his goats. Everything was the work of his own hands. He\r\nhad made them all. Which should he take? He hesitated long. He must take\r\nhome some of his belongings to show the people at home. And there were\r\nhis parrot and the dog which had won a place in Robinson's heart. He\r\ndecided to take them along. At length he got together his diary, his\r\nparasol, his Bible, his treasures, a suit of clothes, his dog, and a\r\nhat. He had saved, too, his bow and arrows. These he decided to take\r\nalong. Everything else he gave to his good man Friday and the Spaniard\r\nwho wished to be allowed to remain on the island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBINSON LEAVING THE ISLAND]\r\n\r\nRobinson kissed Friday tenderly. He with great effort finally tore\r\nhimself away and ran to the shore where the ship's boat awaited him. But\r\nRobinson had not counted on the strength of Friday's love for him.\r\nRobinson's boat had not yet reached the ship when Friday sprang into the\r\nwater and swam after him shouting, \"Master, take me with you, I would\r\nrather die than stay here without you.\" Robinson was touched at the\r\ndevotion showed by the faithful Friday, and gave orders to turn the\r\nboat back, and take him on board. The anchor was raised. The ship\r\nstarted on her way to the home Robinson had left so long ago.\r\n\r\nThe wind was favorable and in seven weeks the spires and buildings of\r\nhis native city were in sight. His vessel came slowly up to the wharf\r\nwhere he had taken ship so many years ago. Here, too, he had played and\r\nidled his time away. He remembered it all. His idleness and playing\r\ntruant came back in sad memories. Before Robinson and Friday landed,\r\ntheir good friend the captain gave them each a new suit of clothes.\r\n\r\nEverything had changed. He scarcely knew the place. He was astonished\r\nand confused by the din, hurry and bustle of a great city. Friday seemed\r\ndazed by it all and clung to Robinson's side. The buildings were so\r\ntall, the street cars, the carriages were different. Everywhere there\r\nwere iron machines, casting out smoke, puffing and running about on iron\r\nrails. Robinson had never seen these.\r\n\r\nRobinson, however, did not stop to admire; he pushed on to a certain\r\nstreet and house where lived his parents at the time of his departure.\r\nIt was with difficulty that he found the place. It was now in the heart\r\nof the city. Upon inquiry he found, after much searching, that his\r\nfather had removed his store and home to another part of the city, his\r\nmother had died of grief for her disobedient son. Robinson was sorely\r\ngrieved at this. He had hoped to see her and tell her how sorry he was\r\nthat he had caused her so much anxiety and sorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen he had found the place where his father lived he stole quietly up\r\nto the house and opened the door. His father, now a gray-haired man,\r\nbent with age and sorrow, was sitting in his arm-chair reading.\r\n\r\nRobinson came forward, but his father did not recognize him. \"Who are\r\nyou?\" he said. \"I am Robinson, your long-lost son.\" He knelt by his\r\nfather's side and asked forgiveness for all the trouble he had caused.\r\nHis father was overcome. He could not speak. He drew Robinson with\r\nfeeble hands to his breast. \"My son, I forgive you,\" he said.\r\n\r\nRobinson's boyhood friends heard of his strange return. They had thought\r\nhim dead long ago. They never tired of hearing him tell his strange\r\nstory. They pitied him in his misfortune. But Robinson told them that it\r\nall happened to him because he was idle and disobedient in his youth.\r\n\r\nRobinson at once relieved his father at the store. The business\r\nthrived. His father died. He soon had a home of his own with a happy\r\nfamily. Friday, the dog, and the parrot lived in it, dearly beloved and\r\ncared for by their master the rest of their days. In the home there is a\r\nyoung Robinson who loves to hear his father read from his diary of the\r\nwonderful things that happened on the island.\r\n\r\nRobinson tried many times to find the rightful owner of the gold and\r\njewels, but never succeeded. At last he gave them to a school where boys\r\nwith idle habits were taught to lead useful and industrious lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's An American Robinson Crusoe, by Samuel.
