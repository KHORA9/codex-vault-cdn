BALLANTYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nBEGINNING--MY EARLY LIFE AND CHARACTER--I THIRST FOR ADVENTURE IN\r\nFOREIGN LANDS, AND GO TO SEA.\r\n\r\nRoving has always been, and still is, my ruling passion, the joy of my\r\nheart, the very sunshine of my existence.  In childhood, in boyhood, and\r\nin man's estate I have been a rover; not a mere rambler among the woody\r\nglens and upon the hill-tops of my own native land, but an enthusiastic\r\nrover throughout the length and breadth of the wide, wide world.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild, black night of howling storm, the night on which I was\r\nborn on the foaming bosom of the broad Atlantic Ocean.  My father was a\r\nsea-captain; my grandfather was a sea-captain; my great-grandfather had\r\nbeen a marine.  Nobody could tell positively what occupation _his_\r\nfather had followed; but my dear mother used to assert that he had been\r\na midshipman, whose grandfather, on the mother's side, had been an\r\nadmiral in the Royal Navy.  At any rate, we knew that as far back as our\r\nfamily could be traced, it had been intimately connected with the great\r\nwatery waste.  Indeed, this was the case on both sides of the house; for\r\nmy mother always went to sea with my father on his long voyages, and so\r\nspent the greater part of her life upon the water.\r\n\r\nThus it was, I suppose, that I came to inherit a roving disposition.\r\nSoon after I was born, my father, being old, retired from a seafaring\r\nlife, purchased a small cottage in a fishing village on the west coast\r\nof England, and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the\r\nshores of that sea which had for so many years been his home.  It was\r\nnot long after this that I began to show the roving spirit that dwelt\r\nwithin me.  For some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength,\r\nso that I came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby\r\nknees by walking on them, and made many attempts to stand up and walk\r\nlike a man--all of which attempts, however, resulted in my sitting down\r\nviolently and in sudden surprise.  One day I took advantage of my dear\r\nmother's absence to make another effort; and, to my joy, I actually\r\nsucceeded in reaching the doorstep, over which I tumbled into a pool of\r\nmuddy water that lay before my father's cottage door.  Ah, how vividly I\r\nremember the horror of my poor mother when she found me sweltering in\r\nthe mud amongst a group of cackling ducks, and the tenderness with which\r\nshe stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little body!\r\nFrom this time forth my rambles became more frequent and, as I grew\r\nolder, more distant, until at last I had wandered far and near on the\r\nshore and in the woods around our humble dwelling, and did not rest\r\ncontent until my father bound me apprentice to a coasting-vessel and let\r\nme go to sea.\r\n\r\nFor some years I was happy in visiting the seaports, and in coasting\r\nalong the shores, of my native land.  My Christian name was Ralph; and\r\nmy comrades added to this the name of Rover, in consequence of the\r\npassion which I always evinced for travelling.  Rover was not my real\r\nname; but as I never received any other, I came at last to answer to it\r\nas naturally as to my proper name.  And as it is not a bad one, I see no\r\ngood reason why I should not introduce myself to the reader as Ralph\r\nRover.  My shipmates were kind, good-natured fellows, and they and I got\r\non very well together.  They did, indeed, very frequently make game of\r\nand banter me, but not unkindly; and I overheard them sometimes saying\r\nthat Ralph Rover was a \"queer, old-fashioned fellow.\"  This, I must\r\nconfess, surprised me much; and I pondered the saying long, but could\r\ncome at no satisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my\r\nold-fashionedness lay.  It is true I was a quiet lad, and seldom spoke\r\nexcept when spoken to.  Moreover, I never could understand the jokes of\r\nmy companions even when they were explained to me, which dulness in\r\napprehension occasioned me much grief.  However, I tried to make up for\r\nit by smiling and looking pleased when I observed that they were\r\nlaughing at some witticism which I had failed to detect.  I was also\r\nvery fond of inquiring into the nature of things and their causes, and\r\noften fell into fits of abstraction while thus engaged in my mind.  But\r\nin all this I saw nothing that did not seem to be exceedingly natural,\r\nand could by no means understand why my comrades should call me \"an\r\nold-fashioned fellow.\"\r\n\r\nNow, while engaged in the coasting trade I fell in with many seamen who\r\nhad travelled to almost every quarter of the globe; and I freely confess\r\nthat my heart glowed ardently within me as they recounted their wild\r\nadventures in foreign lands--the dreadful storms they had weathered, the\r\nappalling dangers they had escaped, the wonderful creatures they had\r\nseen both on the land and in the sea, and the interesting lands and\r\nstrange people they had visited.  But of all the places of which they\r\ntold me, none captivated and charmed my imagination so much as the Coral\r\nIslands of the Southern Seas.  They told me of thousands of beautiful,\r\nfertile islands that had been formed by a small creature called the\r\ncoral insect, where summer reigned nearly all the year round, where the\r\ntrees were laden with a constant harvest of luxuriant fruit, where the\r\nclimate was almost perpetually delightful; yet where, strange to say,\r\nmen were wild, bloodthirsty savages, excepting in those favoured isles\r\nto which the Gospel of our Saviour had been conveyed.  These exciting\r\naccounts had so great an effect upon my mind that, when I reached the\r\nage of fifteen, I resolved to make a voyage to the South Seas.\r\n\r\nI had no little difficulty, at first, in prevailing on my dear parents\r\nto let me go; but when I urged on my father that he would never have\r\nbecome a great captain had he remained in the coasting trade, he saw the\r\ntruth of what I said and gave his consent.  My dear mother, seeing that\r\nmy father had made up his mind, no longer offered opposition to my\r\nwishes.  \"But, oh Ralph!\" she said on the day I bade her adieu, \"come\r\nback soon to us, my dear boy; for we are getting old now, Ralph, and may\r\nnot have many years to live.\"\r\n\r\nI will not take up my readers' time with a minute account of all that\r\noccurred before I took my final leave of my dear parents.  Suffice it to\r\nsay that my father placed me under the charge of an old messmate of his\r\nown, a merchant captain, who was on the point of sailing to the South\r\nSeas in his own ship, the _Arrow_.  My mother gave me her blessing and a\r\nsmall Bible; and her last request was that I would never forget to read\r\na chapter every day and say my prayers, which I promised, with tears in\r\nmy eyes, that I would certainly do.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards I went on board the _Arrow_, which was a fine, large\r\nship, and set sail for the islands of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTURE--THE SEA--MY COMPANIONS--SOME ACCOUNT OF THE WONDERFUL\r\nSIGHTS WE SAW ON THE GREAT DEEP--A DREADFUL STORM AND A FRIGHTFUL WRECK.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, beautiful, warm day when our ship spread her canvas to\r\nthe breeze and sailed for the regions of the south.  Oh, how my heart\r\nbounded with delight as I listened to the merry chorus of the sailors\r\nwhile they hauled at the ropes and got in the anchor!  The captain\r\nshouted; the men ran to obey; the noble ship bent over to the breeze,\r\nand the shore gradually faded from my view; while I stood looking on,\r\nwith a kind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that struck me as being different from anything I had\r\nyet seen during my short career on the sea, was the hoisting of the\r\nanchor on deck and lashing it firmly down with ropes, as if we had now\r\nbid adieu to the land for ever and would require its services no more.\r\n\r\n\"There, lass!\" cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving the fluke of\r\nthe anchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was\r\ncompleted--\"there, lass, take a good nap now, for we sha'n't ask you to\r\nkiss the mud again for many a long day to come!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was.  That anchor did not \"kiss the mud\" for many long days\r\nafterwards; and when at last it did, it was for the last time!\r\n\r\nThere were a number of boys in the ship, but two of them were my special\r\nfavourites.  Jack Martin was a tall, strapping, broad-shouldered youth\r\nof eighteen, with a handsome, good-humoured, firm face.  He had had a\r\ngood education, was clever and hearty and lion-like in his actions, but\r\nmild and quiet in disposition.  Jack was a general favourite, and had a\r\npeculiar fondness for me.  My other companion was Peterkin Gay.  He was\r\nlittle, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, and about fourteen years\r\nold.  But Peterkin's mischief was almost always harmless, else he could\r\nnot have been so much beloved as he was.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, youngster!\" cried Jack Martin, giving me a slap on the shoulder\r\nthe day I joined the ship, \"come below and I'll show you your berth.\r\nYou and I are to be messmates; and I think we shall be good friends, for\r\nI like the look o' you.\"\r\n\r\nJack was right.  He and I, and Peterkin afterwards, became the best and\r\nstaunchest friends that ever tossed together on the stormy waves.\r\n\r\nI shall say little about the first part of our voyage.  We had the usual\r\namount of rough weather and calm; also we saw many strange fish rolling\r\nin the sea, and I was greatly delighted one day by seeing a shoal of\r\nflying-fish dart out of the water and skim through the air about a foot\r\nabove the surface.  They were pursued by dolphins, which feed on them;\r\nand one flying-fish, in its terror, flew over the ship, struck on the\r\nrigging, and fell upon the deck.  Its wings were just fins elongated;\r\nand we found that they could never fly far at a time, and never mounted\r\ninto the air like birds, but skimmed along the surface of the sea.  Jack\r\nand I had it for dinner, and found it remarkably good.\r\n\r\nWhen we approached Cape Horn, at the southern extremity of America, the\r\nweather became very cold and stormy, and the sailors began to tell\r\nstories about the furious gales and the dangers of that terrible cape.\r\n\r\n\"Cape Horn,\" said one, \"is the most horrible headland I ever doubled.\r\nI've sailed round it twice already, and both times the ship was a'most\r\nblow'd out o' the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been round it once,\" said another; \"an' that time the sails were\r\nsplit, and the ropes frozen in the blocks so that they wouldn't work,\r\nand we wos all but lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' I've been round it five times,\" cried a third; \"an' every time wos\r\nwuss than another, the gales wos so tree-mendous!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I've been round it, no times at all,\" cried Peterkin with an\r\nimpudent wink in his eye, \"an' that time I wos blow'd inside out!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather, and\r\nin the course of a few weeks afterwards were sailing gently, before a\r\nwarm tropical breeze, over the Pacific Ocean.  Thus we proceeded on our\r\nvoyage--sometimes bounding merrily before a fair breeze; at other times\r\nfloating calmly on the glassy wave and fishing for the curious\r\ninhabitants of the deep, all of which, although the sailors thought\r\nlittle of them, were strange, and interesting, and very wonderful to me.\r\n\r\nAt last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific; and I shall\r\nnever forget the delight with which I gazed--when we chanced to pass\r\none--at the pure white, dazzling shores, and the verdant palm-trees,\r\nwhich looked bright and beautiful in the sunshine.  And often did we\r\nthree long to be landed on one, imagining that we should certainly find\r\nperfect happiness there!  Our wish was granted sooner than we expected.\r\n\r\nOne night, soon after we entered the tropics, an awful storm burst upon\r\nour ship.  The first squall of wind carried away two of our masts, and\r\nleft only the foremast standing.  Even this, however, was more than\r\nenough, for we did not dare to hoist a rag of sail on it.  For five days\r\nthe tempest raged in all its fury.  Everything was swept off the decks,\r\nexcept one small boat.  The steersman was lashed to the wheel lest he\r\nshould be washed away, and we all gave ourselves up for lost.  The\r\ncaptain said that he had no idea where we were, as we had been blown far\r\nout of our course; and we feared much that we might get among the\r\ndangerous coral reefs which are so numerous in the Pacific.  At daybreak\r\non the sixth morning of the gale we saw land ahead; it was an island\r\nencircled by a reef of coral, on which the waves broke in fury.  There\r\nwas calm water within this reef, but we could see only one narrow\r\nopening into it.  For this opening we steered; but ere we reached it a\r\ntremendous wave broke on our stern, tore the rudder completely off, and\r\nleft us at the mercy of the winds and waves.\r\n\r\n\"It's all over with us now, lads!\" said the captain to the men.  \"Get\r\nthe boat ready to launch; we shall be on the rocks in less than\r\nhalf-an-hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe men obeyed in gloomy silence, for they felt that there was little\r\nhope of so small a boat living in such a sea.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boys,\" said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to me and Peterkin, as\r\nwe stood on the quarter-deck awaiting our fate--\"come, boys; we three\r\nshall stick together.  You see it is impossible that the little boat can\r\nreach the shore, crowded with men.  It will be sure to upset, so I mean\r\nrather to trust myself to a large oar.  I see through the telescope that\r\nthe ship will strike at the tail of the reef, where the waves break into\r\nthe quiet water inside; so if we manage to cling to the oar till it is\r\ndriven over the breakers, we may perhaps gain the shore.  What say you?\r\nWill you join me?\"\r\n\r\nWe gladly agreed to follow Jack, for he inspired us with confidence--\r\nalthough I could perceive, by the sad tone of his voice, that he had\r\nlittle hope; and indeed, when I looked at the white waves that lashed\r\nthe reef and boiled against the rocks as if in fury, I felt that there\r\nwas but a step between us and death.  My heart sank within me; but at\r\nthat moment my thoughts turned to my beloved mother, and I remembered\r\nthose words, which were among the last that she said to me: \"Ralph, my\r\ndearest child, always remember, in the hour of danger, to look to your\r\nLord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  He alone is both able and willing to\r\nsave your body and your soul.\"  So I felt much comforted when I thought\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nThe ship was now very near the rocks.  The men were ready with the boat,\r\nand the captain beside them giving orders, when a tremendous wave came\r\ntowards us.  We three ran towards the bow to lay hold of our oar, and\r\nhad barely reached it when the wave fell on the deck with a crash like\r\nthunder.  At the same moment the ship struck; the foremast broke off\r\nclose to the deck and went over the side, carrying the boat and men\r\nalong with it.  Our oar got entangled with the wreck, and Jack seized an\r\naxe to cut it free; but owing to the motion of the ship, he missed the\r\ncordage and struck the axe deep into the oar.  Another wave, however,\r\nwashed it clear of the wreck.  We all seized hold of it, and the next\r\ninstant we were struggling in the wild sea.  The last thing I saw was\r\nthe boat whirling in the surf, and all the sailors tossed into the\r\nfoaming waves.  Then I became insensible.\r\n\r\nOn recovering from my swoon I found myself lying on a bank of soft\r\ngrass, under shelter of an overhanging rock, with Peterkin on his knees\r\nby my side, tenderly bathing my temples with water, and endeavouring to\r\nstop the blood that flowed from a wound in my forehead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE CORAL ISLAND--OUR FIRST COGITATIONS AFTER LANDING AND THE RESULT OF\r\nTHEM--WE CONCLUDE THAT THE ISLAND IS UNINHABITED.\r\n\r\nThere is a strange and peculiar sensation experienced in recovering from\r\na state of insensibility which is almost indescribable: a sort of\r\ndreamy, confused consciousness; a half-waking, half-sleeping condition,\r\naccompanied with a feeling of weariness, which, however, is by no means\r\ndisagreeable.  As I slowly recovered, and heard the voice of Peterkin\r\ninquiring whether I felt better, I thought that I must have overslept\r\nmyself, and should be sent to the masthead for being lazy; but before I\r\ncould leap up in haste, the thought seemed to vanish suddenly away, and\r\nI fancied that I must have been ill.  Then a balmy breeze fanned my\r\ncheek; and I thought of home, and the garden at the back of my father's\r\ncottage with its luxuriant flowers, and the sweet-scented honeysuckle\r\nthat my dear mother trained so carefully upon the trellised porch.  But\r\nthe roaring of the surf put these delightful thoughts to flight, and I\r\nwas back again at sea, watching the dolphins and the flying-fish, and\r\nreefing topsails off the wild and stormy Cape Horn.  Gradually the roar\r\nof the surf became louder and more distinct.  I thought of being wrecked\r\nfar, far away from my native land, and slowly opened my eyes to meet\r\nthose of my companion Jack, who, with a look of intense anxiety, was\r\ngazing into my face.\r\n\r\n\"Speak to us, my dear Ralph!\" whispered Jack tenderly.  \"Are you better\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\nI smiled and looked up, saying, \"Better!  Why, what do you mean, Jack?\r\nI'm quite well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what are you shamming for, and frightening us in this way?\" said\r\nPeterkin, smiling through his tears; for the poor boy had been really\r\nunder the impression that I was dying.\r\n\r\nI now raised myself on my elbow, and putting my hand to my forehead,\r\nfound that it had been cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good\r\ndeal of blood.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Ralph,\" said Jack, pressing me gently backward, \"lie down,\r\nmy boy; you're not right yet.  Wet your lips with this water; it's cool\r\nand clear as crystal.  I got it from a spring close at hand.  There,\r\nnow, don't say a word--hold your tongue,\" he said, seeing me about to\r\nspeak.  \"I'll tell you all about it, but you must not utter a syllable\r\ntill you have rested well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't stop him from speaking, Jack!\" said Peterkin, who, now that\r\nhis fears for my safety were removed, busied himself in erecting a\r\nshelter of broken branches in order to protect me from the wind--which,\r\nhowever, was almost unnecessary, for the rock beside which I had been\r\nlaid completely broke the force of the gale.  \"Let him speak, Jack; it's\r\na comfort to hear that he's alive after lying there stiff and white and\r\nsulky for a whole hour, just like an Egyptian mummy.--Never saw such a\r\nfellow as you are, Ralph--always up to mischief.  You've almost knocked\r\nout all my teeth and more than half-choked me, and now you go shamming\r\ndead!  It's very wicked of you, indeed it is.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Peterkin ran on in this style my faculties became quite clear\r\nagain, and I began to understand my position.  \"What do you mean by\r\nsaying I half-choked you, Peterkin?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"What do I mean?  Is English not your mother-tongue? or do you want me\r\nto repeat it in French by way of making it clearer?  Don't you\r\nremember?\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember nothing,\" said I, interrupting him, \"after we were thrown\r\ninto the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Peterkin!\" said Jack; \"you're exciting Ralph with your\r\nnonsense.--I'll explain it to you.  You recollect that, after the ship\r\nstruck, we three sprang over the bow into the sea?  Well, I noticed that\r\nthe oar struck your head and gave you that cut on the brow which nearly\r\nstunned you, so that you grasped Peterkin round the neck without knowing\r\napparently what you were about.  In doing so, you pushed the telescope--\r\nwhich you clung to as if it had been your life--against Peterkin's\r\nmouth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pushed it against his mouth!\" interrupted Peterkin; \"say crammed it\r\ndown his throat!  Why, there's a distinct mark of the brass rim on the\r\nback of my gullet at this moment!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, be that as it may,\" continued Jack, \"you clung to him,\r\nRalph, till I feared you really would choke him.  But I saw that he had\r\na good hold of the oar; so I exerted myself to the utmost to push you\r\ntowards the shore, which we luckily reached without much trouble, for\r\nthe water inside the reef is quite calm.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the captain and crew, what of them?\"  I inquired anxiously.\r\n\r\nJack shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Are they lost?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they are not lost, I hope; but, I fear, there is not much chance of\r\ntheir being saved.  The ship struck at the very tail of the island on\r\nwhich we are cast.  When the boat was tossed into the sea it fortunately\r\ndid not upset, although it shipped a good deal of water, and all the men\r\nmanaged to scramble into it; but before they could get the oars out, the\r\ngale carried them past the point and away to leeward of the island.\r\nAfter we landed I saw them endeavouring to pull towards us; but as they\r\nhad only one pair of oars out of the eight that belonged to the boat,\r\nand as the wind was blowing right in their teeth, they gradually lost\r\nground.  Then I saw them put about and hoist some sort of sail--a\r\nblanket, I fancy, for it was too small for the boat--and in half-an-hour\r\nthey were out of sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellows!\"  I murmured sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\"But the more I think about it I've better hope of them,\" continued Jack\r\nin a more cheerful tone.  \"You see, Ralph, I've read a great deal about\r\nthese South Sea Islands, and I know that in many places they are\r\nscattered about in thousands over the sea, so they're almost sure to\r\nfall in with one of them before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I hope so,\" said Peterkin earnestly.  \"But what has become of\r\nthe wreck, Jack?  I saw you clambering up the rocks there while I was\r\nwatching Ralph.  Did you say she had gone to pieces?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she has not gone to pieces; but she has gone to the bottom,\"\r\nreplied Jack.  \"As I said before, she struck on the tail of the island\r\nand stove in her bow; but the next breaker swung her clear, and she\r\nfloated away to leeward.  The poor fellows in the boat made a hard\r\nstruggle to reach her, but long before they came near her she filled and\r\nwent down.  It was after she had foundered that I saw them trying to\r\npull to the island.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence after Jack had ceased speaking, and I have no\r\ndoubt that each was revolving in his mind our extraordinary position.\r\nFor my part, I cannot say that my reflections were very agreeable.  I\r\nknew that we were on an island, for Jack had said so; but whether it was\r\ninhabited or not, I did not know.  If it should be inhabited, I felt\r\ncertain, from all I had heard of South Sea Islanders, that we should be\r\nroasted alive and eaten.  If it should turn out to be uninhabited, I\r\nfancied that we should be starved to death.  \"Oh,\" thought I, \"if the\r\nship had only struck on the rocks we might have done pretty well, for we\r\ncould have obtained provisions from her, and tools to enable us to build\r\na shelter; but now--alas! alas! we are lost!\"  These last words I\r\nuttered aloud in my distress.\r\n\r\n\"Lost, Ralph!\" exclaimed Jack, while a smile overspread his hearty\r\ncountenance.  \"Saved, you should have said.  Your cogitations seem to\r\nhave taken a wrong road, and led you to a wrong conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what conclusion I have come to?\" said Peterkin.  \"I have\r\nmade up my mind that it's capital--first-rate--the best thing that ever\r\nhappened to us, and the most splendid prospect that ever lay before\r\nthree jolly young tars.  We've got an island all to ourselves.  We'll\r\ntake possession in the name of the king.  We'll go and enter the service\r\nof its black inhabitants.  Of course we'll rise, naturally, to the top\r\nof affairs: white men always do in savage countries.  You shall be king,\r\nJack; Ralph, prime minister; and I shall be--\"\r\n\r\n\"The court-jester,\" interrupted Jack.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" retorted Peterkin; \"I'll have no title at all.  I shall merely\r\naccept a highly responsible situation under government; for you see,\r\nJack, I'm fond of having an enormous salary and nothing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose there are no natives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll build a charming villa, and plant a lovely garden round it,\r\nstuck all full of the most splendiferous tropical flowers; and we'll\r\nfarm the land, plant, sow, reap, eat, sleep, and be merry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to be serious,\" said Jack, assuming a grave expression of\r\ncountenance--which, I observed, always had the effect of checking\r\nPeterkin's disposition to make fun of everything--\"we are really in\r\nrather an uncomfortable position.  If this is a desert island, we shall\r\nhave to live very much like the wild beasts; for we have not a tool of\r\nany kind--not even a knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have _that_,\" said Peterkin, fumbling in his trousers pocket,\r\nfrom which he drew forth a small penknife with only one blade, and that\r\nwas broken.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's better than nothing.--But come,\" said Jack, rising; \"we\r\nare wasting our time in _talking_ instead of _doing_.--You seem well\r\nenough to walk now, Ralph.--Let us see what we have got in our pockets;\r\nand then let us climb some hill and ascertain what sort of island we\r\nhave been cast upon, for, whether good or bad, it seems likely to be our\r\nhome for some time to come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nWE EXAMINE INTO OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY, AND MAKE A HAPPY DISCOVERY--OUR\r\nISLAND DESCRIBED--JACK PROVES HIMSELF TO BE LEARNED AND SAGACIOUS ABOVE\r\nHIS FELLOWS--CURIOUS DISCOVERIES--NATURAL LEMONADE!\r\n\r\nWe now seated ourselves upon a rock, and began to examine into our\r\npersonal property.  When we reached the shore after being wrecked, my\r\ncompanions had taken off part of their clothes and spread them out in\r\nthe sun to dry; for although the gale was raging fiercely, there was not\r\na single cloud in the bright sky.  They had also stripped off most part\r\nof my wet clothes and spread them also on the rocks.  Having resumed our\r\ngarments, we now searched all our pockets with the utmost care, and laid\r\ntheir contents out on a flat stone before us; and now that our minds\r\nwere fully alive to our condition, it was with no little anxiety that we\r\nturned our several pockets inside out in order that nothing might escape\r\nus.  When all was collected together, we found that our worldly goods\r\nconsisted of the following articles:\r\n\r\nFirst, a small penknife with a single blade, broken off about the middle\r\nand very rusty, besides having two or three notches on its edge.\r\n(Peterkin said of this, with his usual pleasantry, that it would do for\r\na saw as well as a knife, which was a great advantage.)  Second, an old\r\nGerman-silver pencil-case without any lead in it.  Third, a piece of\r\nwhip-cord about six yards long.  Fourth, a sailmaker's needle of a small\r\nsize.  Fifth, a ship's telescope, which I happened to have in my hand at\r\nthe time the ship struck, and which I had clung to firmly all the time I\r\nwas in the water; indeed, it was with difficulty that Jack got it out of\r\nmy grasp when I was lying insensible on the shore.  I cannot understand\r\nwhy I kept such a firm hold of this telescope.  They say that a drowning\r\nman will clutch at a straw.  Perhaps it may have been some such feeling\r\nin me, for I did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were\r\nwrecked.  However, we felt some pleasure in having it with us now--\r\nalthough we did not see that it could be of much use to us, as the glass\r\nat the small end was broken to pieces.  Our sixth article was a brass\r\nring which Jack always wore on his little finger.  I never understood\r\nwhy he wore it; for Jack was not vain of his appearance, and did not\r\nseem to care for ornaments of any kind.  Peterkin said, \"it was in\r\nmemory of the girl he left behind him!\"  But as he never spoke of this\r\ngirl to either of us, I am inclined to think that Peterkin was either\r\njesting or mistaken.  In addition to these articles, we had a little bit\r\nof tinder and the clothes on our backs.  These last were as follows:\r\n\r\nEach of us had on a pair of stout canvas trousers and a pair of sailors'\r\nthick shoes.  Jack wore a red flannel shirt, a blue jacket, and a red\r\nKilmarnock bonnet or nightcap, besides a pair of worsted socks, and a\r\ncotton pocket-handkerchief with sixteen portraits of Lord Nelson printed\r\non it and a union-jack in the middle.  Peterkin had on a striped flannel\r\nshirt--which he wore outside his trousers and belted round his waist,\r\nafter the manner of a tunic--and a round black straw hat.  He had no\r\njacket, having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea; but\r\nthis was not of much consequence, as the climate of the island proved to\r\nbe extremely mild--so much so, indeed, that Jack and I often preferred\r\nto go about without our jackets.  Peterkin had also a pair of white\r\ncotton socks and a blue handkerchief with white spots all over it.  My\r\nown costume consisted of a blue flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a black\r\ncap, and a pair of worsted socks, besides the shoes and canvas trousers\r\nalready mentioned.  This was all we had, and besides these things we had\r\nnothing else; but when we thought of the danger from which we had\r\nescaped, and how much worse off we might have been had the ship struck\r\non the reef during the night, we felt very thankful that we were\r\npossessed of so much, although, I must confess, we sometimes wished that\r\nwe had had a little more.\r\n\r\nWhile we were examining these things and talking about them, Jack\r\nsuddenly started and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"The oar!  We have forgotten the oar!\"\r\n\r\n\"What good will that do us?\" said Peterkin.  \"There's wood enough on the\r\nisland to make a thousand oars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, lad,\" replied Jack; \"but there's a bit of hoop-iron at the end of\r\nit, and that may be of much use to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" said I; \"let us go fetch it.\"  And with that we all three\r\nrose and hastened down to the beach.  I still felt a little weak from\r\nloss of blood, so that my companions soon began to leave me behind; but\r\nJack perceived this, and, with his usual considerate good-nature, turned\r\nback to help me.  This was now the first time that I had looked well\r\nabout me since landing, as the spot where I had been laid was covered\r\nwith thick bushes, which almost hid the country from our view.  As we\r\nnow emerged from among these and walked down the sandy beach together, I\r\ncast my eyes about, and truly my heart glowed within me and my spirits\r\nrose at the beautiful prospect which I beheld on every side.  The gale\r\nhad suddenly died away, just as if it had blown furiously till it dashed\r\nour ship upon the rocks, and had nothing more to do after accomplishing\r\nthat.  The island on which we stood was hilly, and covered almost\r\neverywhere with the most beautiful and richly coloured trees, bushes,\r\nand shrubs, none of which I knew the names of at that time--except,\r\nindeed, the cocoa-nut palms, which I recognised at once from the many\r\npictures that I had seen of them before I left home.  A sandy beach of\r\ndazzling whiteness lined this bright-green shore, and upon it there fell\r\na gentle ripple of the sea.  This last astonished me much, for I\r\nrecollected that at home the sea used to fall in huge billows on the\r\nshore long after a storm had subsided.  But on casting my glance out to\r\nsea the cause became apparent.  About a mile distant from the shore I\r\nsaw the great billows of the ocean rolling like a green wall, and\r\nfalling with a long, loud roar upon a low coral reef, where they were\r\ndashed into white foam and flung up in clouds of spray.  This spray\r\nsometimes flew exceedingly high, and every here and there a beautiful\r\nrainbow was formed for a moment among the falling drops.  We afterwards\r\nfound that this coral reef extended quite round the island, and formed a\r\nnatural breakwater to it.  Beyond this, the sea rose and tossed\r\nviolently from the effects of the storm; but between the reef and the\r\nshore it was as calm and as smooth as a pond.\r\n\r\nMy heart was filled with more delight than I can express at sight of so\r\nmany glorious objects, and my thoughts turned suddenly to the\r\ncontemplation of the Creator of them all.  I mention this the more\r\ngladly, because at that time, I am ashamed to say, I very seldom thought\r\nof my Creator, although I was constantly surrounded by the most\r\nbeautiful and wonderful of His works.  I observed, from the expression\r\nof my companion's countenance, that he too derived much joy from the\r\nsplendid scenery, which was all the more agreeable to us after our long\r\nvoyage on the salt sea.  There the breeze was fresh and cold; but here\r\nit was delightfully mild, and when a puff blew off the land it came\r\nladen with the most exquisite perfume that can be imagined.  While we\r\nthus gazed we were startled by a loud \"Huzza!\" from Peterkin, and on\r\nlooking towards the edge of the sea we saw him capering and jumping\r\nabout like a monkey, and ever and anon tugging with all his might at\r\nsomething that lay upon the shore.\r\n\r\n\"What an odd fellow he is, to be sure!\" said Jack, taking me by the arm\r\nand hurrying forward.  \"Come, let us hasten to see what it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, boys--hurrah!  Come along!  Just what we want!\" cried\r\nPeterkin as we drew near, still tugging with all his power.\r\n\"First-rate; just the very ticket!\"\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say to my readers that my companion Peterkin was in the\r\nhabit of using very remarkable and peculiar phrases.  And I am free to\r\nconfess that I did not well understand the meaning of some of them--\r\nsuch, for instance, as \"the very ticket;\" but I think it my duty to\r\nrecount everything relating to my adventures with a strict regard to\r\ntruthfulness in as far as my memory serves me, so I write, as nearly as\r\npossible, the exact words that my companions spoke.  I often asked\r\nPeterkin to explain what he meant by \"ticket,\" but he always answered me\r\nby going into fits of laughter.  However, by observing the occasions on\r\nwhich he used it, I came to understand that it meant to show that\r\nsomething was remarkably good or fortunate.\r\n\r\nOn coming up we found that Peterkin was vainly endeavouring to pull the\r\naxe out of the oar into which, it will be remembered, Jack struck it\r\nwhile endeavouring to cut away the cordage among which it had become\r\nentangled at the bow of the ship.  Fortunately for us, the axe had\r\nremained fast in the oar, and even now all Peterkin's strength could not\r\ndraw it out of the cut.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is capital indeed!\" cried Jack, at the same time giving the\r\naxe a wrench that plucked it out of the tough wood.  \"How fortunate this\r\nis!  It will be of more value to us than a hundred knives, and the edge\r\nis quite new and sharp.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll answer for the toughness of the handle, at any rate!\" cried\r\nPeterkin; \"my arms are nearly pulled out of the sockets.  But see here,\r\nour luck is great.  There is iron on the blade.\"  He pointed to a piece\r\nof hoop-iron as he spoke, which had been nailed round the blade of the\r\noar to prevent it from splitting.\r\n\r\nThis also was a fortunate discovery.  Jack went down on his knees, and\r\nwith the edge of the axe began carefully to force out the nails.  But as\r\nthey were firmly fixed in, and the operation blunted our axe, we carried\r\nthe oar up with us to the place where we had left the rest of our\r\nthings, intending to burn the wood away from the iron at a more\r\nconvenient time.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack after we had laid it on the stone which contained\r\nour little all, \"I propose that we should go to the tail of the island,\r\nwhere the ship struck, which is only a quarter of a mile off; and see if\r\nanything else has been thrown ashore.  I don't expect anything, but it\r\nis well to see.  When we get back here it will be time to have our\r\nsupper and prepare our beds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed!\" cried Peterkin and I together, as, indeed, we would have\r\nagreed to any proposal that Jack made; for, besides his being older and\r\nmuch stronger and taller than either of us, he was a very clever fellow,\r\nand, I think, would have induced people much older than himself to\r\nchoose him for their leader, especially if they required to be led on a\r\nbold enterprise.\r\n\r\nNow as we hastened along the white beach, which shone so brightly in the\r\nrays of the setting sun that our eyes were quite dazzled by its glare,\r\nit suddenly came into Peterkin's head that we had nothing to eat except\r\nthe wild berries which grew in profusion at our feet.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do, Jack?\" said he with a rueful look.  \"Perhaps they may\r\nbe poisonous!\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear,\" replied Jack confidently.  \"I have observed that a few of\r\nthem are not unlike some of the berries that grow wild on our own native\r\nhills.  Besides, I saw one or two strange birds eating them just a few\r\nminutes ago, and what won't kill the birds won't kill us.  But look up\r\nthere, Peterkin,\" continued Jack, pointing to the branched head of a\r\ncocoa-nut palm.  \"There are nuts for us in all stages.\"\r\n\r\n\"So there are!\" cried Peterkin, who, being of a very unobservant nature,\r\nhad been too much taken up with other things to notice anything so high\r\nabove his head as the fruit of a palm-tree.  But whatever faults my\r\nyoung comrade had, he could not be blamed for want of activity or animal\r\nspirits.  Indeed, the nuts had scarcely been pointed out to him when he\r\nbounded up the tall stem of the tree like a squirrel, and in a few\r\nminutes returned with three nuts, each as large as a man's fist.\r\n\r\n\"You had better keep them till we return,\" said Jack.  \"Let us finish\r\nour work before eating.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it, captain; go ahead!\" cried Peterkin, thrusting the nuts into\r\nhis trousers pocket.  \"In fact, I don't want to eat just now; but I\r\nwould give a good deal for a drink.  Oh, that I could find a spring! but\r\nI don't see the smallest sign of one hereabouts.  I say, Jack, how does\r\nit happen that you seem to be up to everything?  You have told us the\r\nnames of half-a-dozen trees already, and yet you say that you were never\r\nin the South Seas before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not up to everything, Peterkin, as you'll find out ere long,\"\r\nreplied Jack with a smile; \"but I have been a great reader of books of\r\ntravel and adventure all my life, and that has put me up to a good many\r\nthings that you are, perhaps, not acquainted with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, that's all humbug!  If you begin to lay everything to the\r\ncredit of books, I'll quite lose my opinion of you,\" cried Peterkin with\r\na look of contempt.  \"I've seen a lot o' fellows that were _always_\r\nporing over books, and when they came to try to _do_ anything, they were\r\nno better than baboons!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right,\" retorted Jack; \"and I have seen a lot of fellows,\r\nwho never looked into books at all, who knew nothing about anything\r\nexcept the things they had actually seen, and very little they knew even\r\nabout these.  Indeed, some were so ignorant that they did not know that\r\ncocoa-nuts grew on cocoa-nut trees!\"\r\n\r\nI could not refrain from laughing at this rebuke, for there was much\r\ntruth in it as to Peterkin's ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! maybe you're right,\" answered Peterkin; \"but I would not give\r\n_tuppence_ for a man of books if he had nothing else in him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither would I,\" said Jack; \"but that's no reason why you should run\r\nbooks down, or think less of me for having read them.  Suppose, now,\r\nPeterkin, that you wanted to build a ship, and I were to give you a long\r\nand particular account of the way to do it, would not that be very\r\nuseful?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it,\" said Peterkin, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"And suppose I were to write the account in a letter instead of telling\r\nyou in words, would that be less useful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--no, perhaps not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose I were to print it and send it to you in the form of a\r\nbook, would it not be as good and useful as ever?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother!  Jack, you're a philosopher, and that's worse than\r\nanything!\" cried Peterkin with a look of pretended horror.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Peterkin, we shall see,\" returned Jack, halting under the\r\nshade of a cocoa-nut tree.  \"You said you were thirsty just a minute\r\nago.  Now jump up that tree and bring down a nut--not a ripe one; bring\r\na green, unripe one.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin looked surprised, but seeing that Jack was in earnest, he\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Now cut a hole in it with your penknife and clap it to your mouth, old\r\nfellow,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\nPeterkin did as he was directed, and we both burst into uncontrollable\r\nlaughter at the changes that instantly passed over his expressive\r\ncountenance.  No sooner had he put the nut to his mouth, and thrown back\r\nhis head in order to catch what came out of it, than his eyes opened to\r\ntwice their ordinary size with astonishment, while his throat moved\r\nvigorously in the act of swallowing.  Then a smile and a look of intense\r\ndelight overspread his face, except, indeed, the mouth, which, being\r\nfirmly fixed to the hole in the nut, could not take part in the\r\nexpression; but he endeavoured to make up for this by winking at us\r\nexcessively with his right eye.  At length he stopped, and drawing a\r\nlong breath, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Nectar! perfect nectar!--I say, Jack, you're a Briton--the best fellow\r\nI ever met in my life--Only taste that!\" said he, turning to me and\r\nholding the nut to my mouth.  I immediately drank, and certainly I was\r\nmuch surprised at the delightful liquid that flowed copiously down my\r\nthroat.  It was extremely cool, and had a sweet taste, mingled with\r\nacid; in fact, it was the likest thing to lemonade I ever tasted, and\r\nwas most grateful and refreshing.  I handed the nut to Jack, who, after\r\ntasting it, said, \"Now, Peterkin, you unbeliever!  I never saw or tasted\r\na cocoa-nut in my life before, except those sold in shops at home; but I\r\nonce read that the green nuts contain that stuff; and you see it is\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, pray,\" asked Peterkin, \"what sort of `stuff' does the ripe nut\r\ncontain?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hollow kernel,\" answered Jack, \"with a liquid like milk in it; but it\r\ndoes not satisfy thirst so well as hunger.  It is very wholesome food, I\r\nbelieve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meat and drink on the same tree!\" cried Peterkin; \"washing in the sea,\r\nlodging on the ground--and all for nothing!  My dear boys, we're set up\r\nfor life!  It must be the ancient Paradise--hurrah!\" and Peterkin tossed\r\nhis straw hat in the air and ran along the beach, hallooing like a\r\nmadman with delight.\r\n\r\nWe afterwards found, however, that these lovely islands were very unlike\r\nParadise in many things.  But more of this in its proper place.\r\n\r\nWe had now come to the point of rocks on which the ship had struck, but\r\ndid not find a single article, although we searched carefully among the\r\ncoral rocks, which at this place jutted out so far as nearly to join the\r\nreef that encircled the island.  Just as we were about to return,\r\nhowever, we saw something black floating in a little cove that had\r\nescaped our observation.  Running forward, we drew it from the water,\r\nand found it to be a long, thick, leather boot, such as fishermen at\r\nhome wear; and a few paces farther on, we picked up its fellow.  We at\r\nonce recognised these as having belonged to our captain, for he had worn\r\nthem during the whole of the storm in order to guard his legs from the\r\nwaves and spray that constantly washed over our decks.  My first thought\r\non seeing them was that our dear captain had been drowned; but Jack soon\r\nput my mind more at rest on that point by saying that if the captain had\r\nbeen drowned with the boots on, he would certainly have been washed\r\nashore along with them, and that he had no doubt whatever he had kicked\r\nthem off while in the sea that he might swim more easily.\r\n\r\nPeterkin immediately put them on; but they were so large that, as Jack\r\nsaid, they would have done for boots, trousers, and vest too.  I also\r\ntried them; but although I was long enough in the legs for them, they\r\nwere much too large in the feet for me.  So we handed them to Jack, who\r\nwas anxious to make me keep them; but as they fitted his large limbs and\r\nfeet as if they had been made for him, I would not hear of it, so he\r\nconsented at last to use them.  I may remark, however, that Jack did not\r\nuse them often, as they were extremely heavy.\r\n\r\nIt was beginning to grow dark when we returned to our encampment; so we\r\nput off our visit to the top of a hill till next day, and employed the\r\nlight that yet remained to us in cutting down a quantity of boughs and\r\nthe broad leaves of a tree of which none of us knew the name.  With\r\nthese we erected a sort of rustic bower, in which we meant to pass the\r\nnight.  There was no absolute necessity for this, because the air of our\r\nisland was so genial and balmy that we could have slept quite well\r\nwithout any shelter; but we were so little used to sleeping in the open\r\nair that we did not quite relish the idea of lying down without any\r\ncovering over us.  Besides, our bower would shelter us from the\r\nnight-dews or rain, if any should happen to fall.  Having strewed the\r\nfloor with leaves and dry grass, we bethought ourselves of supper.\r\n\r\nBut it now occurred to us, for the first time, that we had no means of\r\nmaking a fire.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there's a fix!  What shall we do?\" said Peterkin, while we both\r\nturned our eyes to Jack, to whom we always looked in our difficulties.\r\nJack seemed not a little perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"There are flints enough, no doubt, on the beach,\" said he; \"but they\r\nare of no use at all without a steel.  However, we must try.\"  So\r\nsaying, he went to the beach, and soon returned with two flints.  On one\r\nof these he placed the tinder, and endeavoured to ignite it; but it was\r\nwith great difficulty that a very small spark was struck out of the\r\nflints, and the tinder, being a bad, hard piece, would not catch.  He\r\nthen tried the bit of hoop-iron, which would not strike fire at all; and\r\nafter that the back of the axe, with no better success.  During all\r\nthese trials Peterkin sat with his hands in his pockets, gazing with a\r\nmost melancholy visage at our comrade, his face growing longer and more\r\nmiserable at each successive failure.\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear!\" he sighed; \"I would not care a button for the cooking of our\r\nvictuals--perhaps they don't need it--but it's so dismal to eat one's\r\nsupper in the dark, and we have had such a capital day that it's a pity\r\nto finish off in this glum style.  Oh, I have it!\" he cried, starting\r\nup: \"the spy-glass--the big glass at the end is a burning-glass!\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget that we have no sun,\" said I.\r\n\r\nPeterkin was silent.  In his sudden recollection of the telescope he had\r\nquite overlooked the absence of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, boys, I've got it now!\" exclaimed Jack, rising and cutting a branch\r\nfrom a neighbouring bush, which he stripped of its leaves.  \"I recollect\r\nseeing this done once at home.  Hand me the bit of whip-cord.\"  With the\r\ncord and branch Jack soon formed a bow.  Then he cut a piece about three\r\ninches long off the end of a dead branch, which he pointed at the two\r\nends.  Round this he passed the cord of the bow, and placed one end\r\nagainst his chest, which was protected from its point by a chip of wood;\r\nthe other point he placed against the bit of tinder, and then began to\r\nsaw vigorously with the bow, just as a blacksmith does with his drill\r\nwhile boring a hole in a piece of iron.  In a few seconds the tinder\r\nbegan to smoke; in less than a minute it caught fire; and in less than a\r\nquarter of an hour we were drinking our lemonade and eating cocoa-nuts\r\nround a fire that would have roasted an entire sheep, while the smoke,\r\nflames, and sparks flew up among the broad leaves of the overhanging\r\npalm-trees, and cast a warm glow upon our leafy bower.\r\n\r\nThat night the starry sky looked down through the gently rustling trees\r\nupon our slumbers, and the distant roaring of the surf upon the coral\r\nreef was our lullaby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nMORNING, AND COGITATIONS CONNECTED THEREWITH--WE LUXURIATE IN THE SEA,\r\nTRY OUR DIVING POWERS, AND MAKE ENCHANTING EXCURSIONS AMONG THE CORAL\r\nGROVES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN--THE WONDERS OF THE DEEP ENLARGED\r\nUPON.\r\n\r\nWhat a joyful thing it is to awaken on a fresh, glorious morning, and\r\nfind the rising sun staring into your face with dazzling brilliancy! to\r\nhear the birds twittering in the bushes, and to hear the murmuring of a\r\nrill, or the soft, hissing ripples as they fall upon the seashore!  At\r\nany time, and in any place, such sights and sounds are most charming;\r\nbut more especially are they so when one awakens to them, for the first\r\ntime, in a novel and romantic situation, with the soft, sweet air of a\r\ntropical climate mingling with the fresh smell of the sea, and stirring\r\nthe strange leaves that flutter overhead and around one, or ruffling the\r\nplumage of the stranger birds that fly inquiringly around as if to\r\ndemand what business we have to intrude uninvited on their domains.\r\nWhen I awoke on the morning after the shipwreck, I found myself in this\r\nmost delightful condition; and as I lay on my back upon my bed of\r\nleaves, gazing up through the branches of the cocoa-nut trees into the\r\nclear blue sky, and watched the few fleecy clouds that passed slowly\r\nacross it, my heart expanded more and more with an exulting gladness,\r\nthe like of which I had never felt before.  While I meditated, my\r\nthoughts again turned to the great and kind Creator of this beautiful\r\nworld, as they had done on the previous day when I first beheld the sea\r\nand the coral reef, with the mighty waves dashing over it into the calm\r\nwaters of the lagoon.\r\n\r\nWhile thus meditating, I naturally bethought me of my Bible, for I had\r\nfaithfully kept the promise which I gave at parting to my beloved\r\nmother--that I would read it every morning; and it was with a feeling of\r\ndismay that I remembered I had left it in the ship.  I was much troubled\r\nabout this.  However, I consoled myself with reflecting that I could\r\nkeep the second part of my promise to her--namely, that I should never\r\nomit to say my prayers.  So I rose quietly lest I should disturb my\r\ncompanions, who were still asleep, and stepped aside into the bushes for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nOn my return I found them still slumbering, so I again lay down to think\r\nover our situation.  Just at that moment I was attracted by the sight of\r\na very small parrot, which Jack afterwards told me was called a\r\nparoquet.  It was seated on a twig that overhung Peterkin's head, and I\r\nwas speedily lost in admiration of its bright-green plumage, which was\r\nmingled with other gay colours.  While I looked I observed that the bird\r\nturned its head slowly from side to side and looked downwards, first\r\nwith the one eye and then with the other.  On glancing downwards I\r\nobserved that Peterkin's mouth was wide open, and that this remarkable\r\nbird was looking into it.  Peterkin used to say that I had not an atom\r\nof fun in my composition, and that I never could understand a joke.  In\r\nregard to the latter, perhaps he was right; yet I think that, when they\r\nwere explained to me, I understood jokes as well as most people.  But in\r\nregard to the former, he must certainly have been wrong, for this bird\r\nseemed to me to be extremely funny; and I could not help thinking that\r\nif it should happen to faint, or slip its foot, and fall off the twig\r\ninto Peterkin's mouth, he would perhaps think it funny too!  Suddenly\r\nthe paroquet bent down its head and uttered a loud scream in his face.\r\nThis awoke him, and with a cry of surprise, he started up, while the\r\nfoolish bird flew precipitately away.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you monster!\" cried Peterkin, shaking his fist at the bird.  Then\r\nhe yawned, and rubbed his eyes, and asked what o'clock it was.\r\n\r\nI smiled at this question, and answered that, as our watches were at the\r\nbottom of the sea, I could not tell, but it was a little past sunrise.\r\n\r\nPeterkin now began to remember where we were.  As he looked up into the\r\nbright sky, and snuffed the scented air, his eyes glistened with\r\ndelight, and he uttered a faint \"Hurrah!\" and yawned again.  Then he\r\ngazed slowly round, till, observing the calm sea through an opening in\r\nthe bushes, he started suddenly up as if he had received an electric\r\nshock, uttered a vehement shout, flung off his garments, and rushing\r\nover the white sands, plunged into the water.  The cry awoke Jack, who\r\nrose on his elbow with a look of grave surprise; but this was followed\r\nby a quiet smile of intelligence on seeing Peterkin in the water.  With\r\nan energy that he only gave way to in moments of excitement, Jack\r\nbounded to his feet, threw off his clothes, shook back his hair, and\r\nwith a lion-like spring, dashed over the sands and plunged into the sea\r\nwith such force as quite to envelop Peterkin in a shower of spray.  Jack\r\nwas a remarkably good swimmer and diver, so that after his plunge we saw\r\nno sign of him for nearly a minute, after which he suddenly emerged,\r\nwith a cry of joy, a good many yards out from the shore.  My spirits\r\nwere so much raised by seeing all this that I, too, hastily threw off my\r\ngarments and endeavoured to imitate Jack's vigorous bound; but I was so\r\nawkward that my foot caught on a stump, and I fell to the ground.  Then\r\nI slipped on a stone while running over the sand and nearly fell again,\r\nmuch to the amusement of Peterkin, who laughed heartily and called me a\r\n\"slow coach;\" while Jack cried out, \"Come along, Ralph, and I'll help\r\nyou!\"  However, when I got into the water I managed very well; for I was\r\nreally a good swimmer and diver too.  I could not, indeed, equal Jack,\r\nwho was superior to any Englishman I ever saw; but I infinitely\r\nsurpassed Peterkin, who could only swim a little, and could not dive at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWhile Peterkin enjoyed himself in the shallow water and in running along\r\nthe beach, Jack and I swam out into the deep water and occasionally\r\ndived for stones.  I shall never forget my surprise and delight on first\r\nbeholding the bottom of the sea.  As I have before stated, the water\r\nwithin the reef was as calm as a pond; and as there was no wind, it was\r\nquite clear from the surface to the bottom, so that we could see down\r\neasily even at a depth of twenty or thirty yards.  When Jack and I dived\r\ninto shallower water we expected to have found sand and stones, instead\r\nof which we found ourselves in what appeared really to be an enchanted\r\ngarden.  The whole of the bottom of the lagoon, as we called the calm\r\nwater within the reef, was covered with coral of every shape, size, and\r\nhue.  Some portions were formed like large mushrooms; others appeared\r\nlike the brain of a man, having stalks or necks attached to them; but\r\nthe most common kind was a species of branching coral, and some portions\r\nwere of a lovely pale-pink colour, others were pure white.  Among this\r\nthere grew large quantities of seaweed of the richest hues imaginable,\r\nand of the most graceful forms; while innumerable fishes--blue, red,\r\nyellow, green, and striped--sported in and out amongst the flower-beds\r\nof this submarine garden, and did not appear to be at all afraid of our\r\napproaching them.\r\n\r\nOn darting to the surface for breath after our first dive, Jack and I\r\nrose close to each other.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever in your life, Ralph, see anything so lovely?\" said Jack as\r\nhe flung the spray from his hair.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" I replied.  \"It appears to me like fairy realms.  I can\r\nscarcely believe that we are not dreaming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dreaming!\" cried Jack.  \"Do you know, Ralph, I'm half-tempted to think\r\nthat we really are dreaming!  But if so, I am resolved to make the most\r\nof it and dream another dive; so here goes--down again, my boy!\"\r\n\r\nWe took the second dive together, and kept beside each other while under\r\nwater; and I was greatly surprised to find that we could keep down much\r\nlonger than I ever recollect having done in our own seas at home.  I\r\nbelieve that this was owing to the heat of the water, which was so warm\r\nthat we afterwards found we could remain in it for two and three hours\r\nat a time without feeling any unpleasant effects such as we used to\r\nexperience in the sea at home.  When Jack reached the bottom, he grasped\r\nthe coral stems and crept along on his hands and knees, peeping under\r\nthe seaweed and among the rocks.  I observed him, also, pick up one or\r\ntwo large oysters and retain them in his grasp, as if he meant to take\r\nthem up with him; so I also gathered a few.  Suddenly he made a grasp at\r\na fish with blue and yellow stripes on its back, and actually touched\r\nits tail, but did not catch it.  At this he turned towards me and\r\nattempted to smile; but no sooner had he done so than he sprang like an\r\narrow to the surface, where, on following him, I found him gasping and\r\ncoughing and spitting water from his mouth.  In a few minutes he\r\nrecovered, and we both turned to swim ashore.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, Ralph,\" said he, \"that I actually tried to laugh under\r\nwater!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I saw,\" I replied; \"and I observed that you very nearly caught that\r\nfish by the tail.  It would have done capitally for breakfast, if you\r\nhad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast enough here,\" said he, holding up the oysters as we landed\r\nand ran up the beach.--\"Hallo, Peterkin!  Here you are, boy! split open\r\nthese fellows while Ralph and I put on our clothes.  They'll agree with\r\nthe cocoa-nuts excellently, I have no doubt.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin, who was already dressed, took the oysters and opened them with\r\nthe edge of our axe, exclaiming, \"Now, that's capital!  There's nothing\r\nI'm so fond of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's lucky,\" remarked Jack.  \"I'll be able to keep you in good\r\norder now, Master Peterkin.  You know you can't dive any better than a\r\ncat.  So, sir, whenever you behave ill you shall have no oysters for\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very glad that our prospect of breakfast is so good,\" said I, \"for\r\nI'm very hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, then, stop your mouth with that, Ralph,\" said Peterkin, holding a\r\nlarge oyster to my lips.  I opened my mouth and swallowed it in silence,\r\nand really it was remarkably good.\r\n\r\nWe now set ourselves earnestly about our preparations for spending the\r\nday.  We had no difficulty with the fire this morning as our\r\nburning-glass was an admirable one; and while we roasted a few oysters\r\nand ate our cocoa-nuts, we held a long, animated conversation about our\r\nplans for the future.  What those plans were, and how we carried them\r\ninto effect, the reader shall see hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nAN EXCURSION INTO THE INTERIOR IN WHICH WE MAKE MANY VALUABLE AND\r\nINTERESTING DISCOVERIES--WE GET A DREADFUL FRIGHT--THE BREAD-FRUIT\r\nTREE--WONDERFUL PECULIARITY OF SOME OF THE FRUIT-TREES--SIGNS OF FORMER\r\nINHABITANTS.\r\n\r\nOur first care, after breakfast, was to place the few articles we\r\npossessed in the crevice of a rock at the farther end of a small cave\r\nwhich we discovered near our encampment.  This cave, we hoped, might be\r\nuseful to us afterwards as a storehouse.  Then we cut two large clubs\r\noff a species of very hard tree which grew near at hand.  One of these\r\nwas given to Peterkin, the other to me, and Jack armed himself with the\r\naxe.  We took these precautions because we purposed to make an excursion\r\nto the top of the mountains of the interior, in order to obtain a better\r\nview of our island.  Of course we knew not what dangers might befall us\r\nby the way, so thought it best to be prepared.\r\n\r\nHaving completed our arrangements and carefully extinguished our fire,\r\nwe sallied forth and walked a short distance along the sea-beach till we\r\ncame to the entrance of a valley, through which flowed the rivulet\r\nbefore mentioned.  Here we turned our backs on the sea and struck into\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\nThe prospect that burst upon our view on entering the valley was truly\r\nsplendid.  On either side of us there was a gentle rise in the land,\r\nwhich thus formed two ridges, about a mile apart, on each side of the\r\nvalley.  These ridges--which, as well as the low grounds between them,\r\nwere covered with trees and shrubs of the most luxuriant kind--continued\r\nto recede inland for about two miles, when they joined the foot of a\r\nsmall mountain.  This hill rose rather abruptly from the head of the\r\nvalley, and was likewise entirely covered, even to the top, with trees--\r\nexcept on one particular spot near the left shoulder, where was a bare\r\nand rocky place of a broken and savage character.  Beyond this hill we\r\ncould not see, and we therefore directed our course up the banks of the\r\nrivulet towards the foot of it, intending to climb to the top, should\r\nthat be possible--as, indeed, we had no doubt it was.\r\n\r\nJack, being the wisest and boldest among us, took the lead, carrying the\r\naxe on his shoulder.  Peterkin, with his enormous club, came second, as\r\nhe said he should like to be in a position to defend me if any danger\r\nshould threaten.  I brought up the rear; but having been more taken up\r\nwith the wonderful and curious things I saw at starting than with\r\nthoughts of possible danger, I had very foolishly left my club behind\r\nme.  Although, as I have said, the trees and bushes were very luxuriant,\r\nthey were not so thickly crowded together as to hinder our progress\r\namong them.  We were able to wind in and out, and to follow the banks of\r\nthe stream quite easily, although, it is true, the height and thickness\r\nof the foliage prevented us from seeing far ahead.  But sometimes a\r\njutting-out rock on the hillsides afforded us a position whence we could\r\nenjoy the romantic view and mark our progress towards the foot of the\r\nhill.  I was particularly struck, during the walk, with the richness of\r\nthe undergrowth in most places, and recognised many berries and plants\r\nthat resembled those of my native land, especially a tall, elegantly\r\nformed fern, which emitted an agreeable perfume.  There were several\r\nkinds of flowers, too; but I did not see so many of these as I should\r\nhave expected in such a climate.  We also saw a great variety of small\r\nbirds of bright plumage, and many paroquets similar to the one, that\r\nawoke Peterkin so rudely in the morning.\r\n\r\nThus we advanced to the foot of the hill without encountering anything\r\nto alarm us, except, indeed, once, when we were passing close under a\r\npart of the hill which was hidden from our view by the broad leaves of\r\nthe banana-trees, which grew in great luxuriance in that part.  Jack was\r\njust preparing to force his way through this thicket when we were\r\nstartled and arrested by a strange pattering or rumbling sound, which\r\nappeared to us quite different from any of the sounds we had heard\r\nduring the previous part of our walk.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" cried Peterkin, stopping short, and grasping his club with both\r\nhands; \"what's that?\"\r\n\r\nNeither of us replied; but Jack seized his axe in his right hand, while\r\nwith the other he pushed aside the broad leaves and endeavoured to peer\r\namongst them.\r\n\r\n\"I can see nothing,\" he said after a short pause.  \"I think it--\"\r\n\r\nAgain the rumbling sound came, louder than before, and we all sprang\r\nback and stood on the defensive.  For myself, having forgotten my club,\r\nand not having taken the precaution to cut another, I buttoned my\r\njacket, doubled my fists, and threw myself into a boxing attitude.  I\r\nmust say, however, that I felt somewhat uneasy; and my companions\r\nafterwards confessed that their thoughts at this moment had been\r\ninstantly filled with all they had ever heard or read of wild beasts and\r\nsavages, torturings at the stake, roastings alive, and such-like\r\nhorrible things.  Suddenly the pattering noise increased with tenfold\r\nviolence.  It was followed by a fearful crash among the bushes, which\r\nwas rapidly repeated, as if some gigantic animal were bounding towards\r\nus.  In another moment an enormous rock came crashing through the\r\nshrubbery, followed by a cloud of dust and small stones, and flew close\r\npast the spot where we stood, carrying bushes and young trees along with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh! is that all?\" exclaimed Peterkin, wiping the perspiration off his\r\nforehead.  \"Why, I thought it was all the wild men and beasts in the\r\nSouth Sea Islands, galloping on in one grand charge to sweep us off the\r\nface of the earth, instead of a mere stone tumbling down the\r\nmountain-side!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" remarked Jack, \"if that same stone had hit any of us it\r\nwould have rendered the charge you speak of quite unnecessary,\r\nPeterkin.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true, and I felt very thankful for our escape.  On examining\r\nthe spot more narrowly, we found that it lay close to the foot of a very\r\nrugged precipice, from which stones of various sizes were always\r\ntumbling at intervals.  Indeed, the numerous fragments lying scattered\r\nall round might have suggested the cause of the sound had we not been\r\ntoo suddenly alarmed to think of anything.\r\n\r\nWe now resumed our journey, resolving that, in our future excursions\r\ninto the interior, we would be careful to avoid this dangerous\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards we arrived at the foot of the hill, and prepared to\r\nascend it.  Here Jack made a discovery which caused us all very great\r\njoy.  This was a tree of a remarkably beautiful appearance, which Jack\r\nconfidently declared to be the celebrated bread-fruit tree.\r\n\r\n\"Is it celebrated?\" inquired Peterkin with a look of great simplicity.\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" replied Jack.\r\n\r\n\"That's odd, now,\" rejoined Peterkin; \"I never heard of it before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's not so celebrated as I thought it was,\" returned Jack,\r\nquietly squeezing Peterkin's hat over his eyes; \"but listen, you\r\nignorant boobie! and hear of it now.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin readjusted his hat, and was soon listening with as much\r\ninterest as myself while Jack told us that this tree is one of the most\r\nvaluable in the islands of the south; that it bears two, sometimes\r\nthree, crops of fruit in the year; that the fruit is very like wheaten\r\nbread in appearance, and that it constitutes the principal food of many\r\nof the islanders.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Peterkin, \"we seem to have everything ready prepared to our\r\nhands in this wonderful island--lemonade ready bottled in nuts, and\r\nloaf-bread growing on the trees!\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin, as usual, was jesting; nevertheless, it is a curious fact that\r\nhe spoke almost the literal truth.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" continued Jack, \"the bread-fruit tree affords a capital gum,\r\nwhich serves the natives for pitching their canoes; the bark of the\r\nyoung branches is made by them into cloth; and of the wood, which is\r\ndurable and of a good colour, they build their houses.  So you see,\r\nlads, that we have no lack of material here to make us comfortable, if\r\nwe are only clever enough to use it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure that that's it?\" asked Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure,\" replied Jack; \"for I was particularly interested in the\r\naccount I once read of it, and I remember the description well.  I am\r\nsorry, however that I have forgotten the descriptions of many other\r\ntrees which I am sure we have seen to-day, if we could but recognise\r\nthem.  So you see, Peterkin, I'm not up to everything yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Jack,\" said Peterkin with a grave, patronising expression\r\nof countenance, patting his tall companion on the shoulder--\"never mind,\r\nJack; you know a good deal for your age.  You're a clever boy, sir--a\r\npromising young man; and if you only go on as you have begun, sir, you\r\nwill--\"\r\n\r\nThe end of this speech was suddenly cut short by Jack tripping up\r\nPeterkin's heels and tumbling him into a mass of thick shrubs, where,\r\nfinding himself comfortable, he lay still, basking in the sunshine,\r\nwhile Jack and I examined the bread-fruit tree.\r\n\r\nWe were much struck with the deep, rich green colour of its broad\r\nleaves, which were twelve or eighteen inches long, deeply indented, and\r\nof a glossy smoothness, like the laurel.  The fruit, with which it was\r\nloaded, was nearly round, and appeared to be about six inches in\r\ndiameter, with a rough rind, marked with lozenge-shaped divisions.  It\r\nwas of various colours, from light pea-green to brown and rich yellow.\r\nJack said that the yellow was the ripe fruit.  We afterwards found that\r\nmost of the fruit-trees on the island were evergreens, and that we\r\nmight, when we wished, pluck the blossom and the ripe fruit from the\r\nsame tree.  Such a wonderful difference from the trees of our own\r\ncountry surprised us not a little.  The bark of the tree was rough and\r\nlight-coloured; the trunk was about two feet in diameter, and it\r\nappeared to be twenty feet high, being quite destitute of branches up to\r\nthat height, where it branched off into a beautiful and umbrageous head.\r\nWe noticed that the fruit hung in clusters of twos and threes on the\r\nbranches; but as we were anxious to get to the top of the hill, we\r\nrefrained from attempting to pluck any at that time.\r\n\r\nOur hearts were now very much cheered by our good fortune, and it was\r\nwith light and active steps that we clambered up the steep sides of the\r\nhill.  On reaching the summit a new, and if possible a grander, prospect\r\nmet our gaze.  We found that this was not the highest part of the\r\nisland, but that another hill lay beyond, with a wide valley between it\r\nand the one on which we stood.  This valley, like the first, was also\r\nfull of rich trees--some dark and some light green, some heavy and thick\r\nin foliage, and others light, feathery, and graceful, while the\r\nbeautiful blossoms on many of them threw a sort of rainbow tint over\r\nall, and gave to the valley the appearance of a garden of flowers.\r\nAmong these we recognised many of the bread-fruit trees, laden with\r\nyellow fruit, and also a great many cocoa-nut palms.  After gazing our\r\nfill we pushed down the hillside, crossed the valley, and soon began to\r\nascend the second mountain.  It was clothed with trees nearly to the\r\ntop; but the summit was bare, and in some places broken.\r\n\r\nWhile on our way up we came to an object which filled us with much\r\ninterest.  This was the stump of a tree that had evidently been cut down\r\nwith an axe!  So, then, we were not the first who had viewed this\r\nbeautiful isle.  The hand of man had been at work there before us.  It\r\nnow began to recur to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited,\r\nalthough we had not seen any traces of man until now.  But a second\r\nglance at the stump convinced us that we had not more reason to think so\r\nnow than formerly; for the surface of the wood was quite decayed and\r\npartly covered with fungus and green matter, so that it must have been\r\ncut many years ago.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Peterkin, \"some ship or other has touched here long ago\r\nfor wood, and only taken one tree.\"\r\n\r\nWe did not think this likely, however, because, in such circumstances,\r\nthe crew of a ship would cut wood of small size and near the shore;\r\nwhereas this was a large tree, and stood near the top of the mountain.\r\nIn fact, it was the highest large tree on the mountain, all above it\r\nbeing wood of very recent growth.\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand it,\" said Jack, scratching the surface of the stump\r\nwith his axe.  \"I can only suppose that the savages have been here and\r\ncut it for some purpose known only to themselves.  But, hallo! what have\r\nwe here?\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Jack began carefully to scrape away the moss and fungus from\r\nthe stump, and soon laid bare three distinct traces of marks, as if some\r\ninscription or initials had been cut thereon.  But although the traces\r\nwere distinct, beyond all doubt, the exact form of the letters could not\r\nbe made out.  Jack thought they looked like JS, but we could not be\r\ncertain.  They had apparently been carelessly cut, and long exposure to\r\nthe weather had so broken them up that we could not make out what they\r\nwere.  We were exceedingly perplexed at this discovery, and stayed a\r\nlong time at the place conjecturing what these marks could have been,\r\nbut without avail; so, as the day was advancing, we left it, and quickly\r\nreached the top of the mountain.\r\n\r\nWe found this to be the highest point of the island, and from it we saw\r\nour kingdom lying, as it were, like a map around us.  As I have always\r\nthought it impossible to get a thing properly into one's understanding\r\nwithout comprehending it, I shall beg the reader's patience for a little\r\nwhile I describe our island, thus, shortly:\r\n\r\nIt consisted of two mountains: the one we guessed at five hundred feet;\r\nthe other, on which we stood, at one thousand.  Between these lay a\r\nrich, beautiful valley, as already said.  This valley crossed the island\r\nfrom one end to the other, being high in the middle and sloping on each\r\nside towards the sea.  The large mountain sloped, on the side farthest\r\nfrom where we had been wrecked, gradually towards the sea; but although,\r\nwhen viewed at a glance, it had thus a regular sloping appearance, a\r\nmore careful observation showed that it was broken up into a multitude\r\nof very small vales--or, rather, dells and glens--intermingled with\r\nlittle rugged spots and small but abrupt precipices here and there, with\r\nrivulets tumbling over their edges and wandering down the slopes in\r\nlittle white streams, sometimes glistening among the broad leaves of the\r\nbread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees, or hiding altogether beneath the rich\r\nunderwood.  At the base of this mountain lay a narrow bright-green plain\r\nor meadow, which terminated abruptly at the shore.  On the other side of\r\nthe island, whence we had come, stood the smaller hill, at the foot of\r\nwhich diverged three valleys--one being that which we had ascended, with\r\na smaller vale on each side of it, and separated from it by the two\r\nridges before mentioned.  In these smaller valleys there were no\r\nstreams, but they were clothed with the same luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the island seemed to be about ten miles, and as it was\r\nalmost circular in form, its circumference must have been thirty miles--\r\nperhaps a little more, if allowance be made for the numerous bays and\r\nindentations of the shore.  The entire island was belted by a beach of\r\npure white sand, on which laved the gentle ripples of the lagoon.  We\r\nnow also observed that the coral reef completely encircled the island;\r\nbut it varied its distance from it here and there--in some places being\r\na mile from the beach, in others a few hundred yards, but the average\r\ndistance was half-a-mile.  The reef lay very low, and the spray of the\r\nsurf broke quite over it in many places.  This surf never ceased its\r\nroar; for, however calm the weather might be, there is always a gentle\r\nswaying motion in the great Pacific, which, although scarce noticeable\r\nout at sea, reaches the shore at last in a huge billow.  The water\r\nwithin the lagoon, as before said, was perfectly still.  There were\r\nthree narrow openings in the reef: one opposite each end of the valley\r\nwhich I have described as crossing the island; the other opposite our\r\nown valley, which we afterwards named the Valley of the Wreck.  At each\r\nof these openings the reef rose into two small green islets, covered\r\nwith bushes, and having one or two cocoa-nut palms on each.  These\r\nislets were very singular, and appeared as if planted expressly for the\r\npurpose of marking the channel into the lagoon.  Our captain was making\r\nfor one of these openings the day we were wrecked--and would have\r\nreached it, too, I doubt not, had not the rudder been torn away.  Within\r\nthe lagoon were several pretty, low coral islands, just opposite our\r\nencampment; and immediately beyond these, out at sea, lay about a dozen\r\nother islands, at various distances, from half-a-mile to ten miles--all\r\nof them, as far as we could discern, smaller than ours and apparently\r\nuninhabited.  They seemed to be low coral islands, raised but little\r\nabove the sea, yet covered with cocoa-nut trees.\r\n\r\nAll this we noted, and a great deal more, while we sat on the top of the\r\nmountain.  After we had satisfied ourselves we prepared to return; but\r\nhere, again, we discovered traces of the presence of man.  These were a\r\npole or staff, and one or two pieces of wood which had been squared with\r\nan axe.  All of these were, however, very much decayed, and they had\r\nevidently not been touched for many years.\r\n\r\nFull of these discoveries, we returned to our encampment.  On the way we\r\nfell in with the traces of some four-footed animal, but whether old or\r\nof recent date none of us were able to guess.  This also tended to raise\r\nour hopes of obtaining some animal food on the island; so we reached\r\nhome in good spirits, quite prepared for supper, and highly satisfied\r\nwith our excursion.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion, in which Peterkin took the lead, we came to the\r\nconclusion that the island was uninhabited, and went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nJACK'S INGENUITY--WE GET INTO DIFFICULTIES ABOUT FISHING, AND GET OUT OF\r\nTHEM BY A METHOD WHICH GIVES US A COLD BATH--HORRIBLE ENCOUNTER WITH A\r\nSHARK.\r\n\r\nFor several days after the excursion related in the last chapter we did\r\nnot wander far from our encampment, but gave ourselves up to forming\r\nplans for the future and making our present abode comfortable.\r\n\r\nThere were various causes that induced this state of comparative\r\ninaction.  In the first place, although everything around us was so\r\ndelightful, and we could without difficulty obtain all that we required\r\nfor our bodily comfort, we did not quite like the idea of settling down\r\nhere for the rest of our lives, far away from our friends and our native\r\nland.  To set energetically about preparations for a permanent residence\r\nseemed so like making up our minds to saying adieu to home and friends\r\nfor ever that we tacitly shrank from it, and put off our preparations,\r\nfor one reason and another, as long as we could.  Then there was a\r\nlittle uncertainty still as to there being natives on the island, and we\r\nentertained a kind of faint hope that a ship might come and take us off.\r\nBut as day after day passed, and neither savages nor ships appeared, we\r\ngave up all hope of an early deliverance, and set diligently to work at\r\nour homestead.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, however, we had not been altogether idle.  We made\r\nseveral experiments in cooking the cocoa-nut, most of which did not\r\nimprove it.  Then we removed our goods and took up our abode in the\r\ncave, but found the change so bad that we returned gladly to the bower.\r\nBesides this, we bathed very frequently, and talked a great deal--at\r\nleast Jack and Peterkin did; I listened.  Among other useful things,\r\nJack, who was ever the most active and diligent, converted about three\r\ninches of the hoop-iron into an excellent knife.  First, he beat it\r\nquite flat with the axe; then he made a rude handle, and tied the\r\nhoop-iron to it with our piece of whip-cord, and ground it to an edge on\r\na piece of sandstone.  When it was finished he used it to shape a better\r\nhandle, to which he fixed it with a strip of his cotton handkerchief--in\r\nwhich operation he had, as Peterkin pointed out, torn off one of Lord\r\nNelson's noses.  However, the whip-cord, thus set free, was used by\r\nPeterkin as a fishing-line.  He merely tied a piece of oyster to the end\r\nof it.  This the fish were allowed to swallow, and then they were pulled\r\nquickly ashore.  But as the line was very short and we had no boat, the\r\nfish we caught were exceedingly small.\r\n\r\nOne day Peterkin came up from the beach, where he had been angling, and\r\nsaid in a very cross tone, \"I'll tell you what, Jack, I'm not going to\r\nbe humbugged with catching such contemptible things any longer.  I want\r\nyou to swim out with me on your back, and let me fish in deep water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Peterkin!\" replied Jack; \"I had no idea you were taking the\r\nthing so much to heart, else I would have got you out of that difficulty\r\nlong ago.  Let me see;\" and Jack looked down at a piece of timber, on\r\nwhich he had been labouring, with a peculiar gaze of abstraction which\r\nhe always assumed when trying to invent or discover anything.\r\n\r\n\"What say you to building a boat?\" he inquired, looking up hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Take far too long,\" was the reply; \"can't be bothered waiting.  I want\r\nto begin at once!\"\r\n\r\nAgain Jack considered.  \"I have it!\" he cried.  \"We'll fell a large tree\r\nand launch the trunk of it in the water, so that when you want to fish\r\nyou've nothing to do but to swim out to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would not a small raft do better?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Much better; but we have no ropes to bind it together with.  Perhaps we\r\nmay find something hereafter that will do as well, but in the meantime\r\nlet us try the tree.\"\r\n\r\nThis was agreed on; so we started off to a spot, not far distant, where\r\nwe knew of a tree that would suit us which grew near the water's edge.\r\nAs soon as we reached it Jack threw off his coat, and wielding the axe\r\nwith his sturdy arms, hacked and hewed at it for a quarter of an hour\r\nwithout stopping.  Then he paused, and while he sat down to rest I\r\ncontinued the work.  Then Peterkin made a vigorous attack on it; so that\r\nwhen Jack renewed his powerful blows, a few minutes' cutting brought it\r\ndown with a terrible crash.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!  Now for it!\" cried Jack.  \"Let us off with its head!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he began to cut through the stem again at about six yards\r\nfrom the thick end.  This done, he cut three strong, short poles or\r\nlevers from the stout branches, with which to roll the log down the\r\nbeach into the sea; for, as it was nearly two feet thick at the large\r\nend, we could not move it without such helps.  With the levers, however,\r\nwe rolled it slowly into the sea.\r\n\r\nHaving been thus successful in launching our vessel, we next shaped the\r\nlevers into rude oars or paddles, and then attempted to embark.  This\r\nwas easy enough to do; but after seating ourselves astride the log, it\r\nwas with the utmost difficulty we kept it from rolling round and\r\nplunging us into the water.  Not that we minded that much; but we\r\npreferred, if possible, to fish in dry clothes.  To be sure, our\r\ntrousers were necessarily wet, as our legs were dangling in the water on\r\neach side of the log; but as they could be easily dried, we did not\r\ncare.  After half-an-hour's practice, we became expert enough to keep\r\nour balance pretty steadily.  Then Peterkin laid down his paddle, and\r\nhaving baited his line with a whole oyster, dropped it into deep water.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, Jack,\" said he, \"be cautious; steer clear o' that seaweed.\r\nThere! that's it; gently, now--gently.  I see a fellow at least a foot\r\nlong down there coming to--Ha! that's it!  Oh bother! he's off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he bite?\" said Jack, urging the log onwards a little with his\r\npaddle.\r\n\r\n\"Bite?  Ay! he took it into his mouth, but the moment I began to haul he\r\nopened his jaws and let it out again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him swallow it next time,\" said Jack, laughing at the melancholy\r\nexpression of Peterkin's visage.\r\n\r\n\"There he's again!\" cried Peterkin, his eyes flashing with excitement.\r\n\"Look out!  Now, then!  No!  Yes!  No!  Why, the brute _won't_ swallow\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Try to haul him up by the mouth, then!\" cried Jack.  \"Do it gently.\"\r\n\r\nA heavy sigh and a look of blank despair showed that poor Peterkin had\r\ntried and failed again.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, lad,\" said Jack in a voice of sympathy; \"we'll move on and\r\noffer it to some other fish.\"  So saying, Jack plied his paddle; but\r\nscarcely had he moved from the spot when a fish with an enormous head\r\nand a little body darted from under a rock and swallowed the bait at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\"Got him this time--that's a fact!\" cried Peterkin, hauling in the line.\r\n\"He's swallowed the bait right down to his tail, I declare!  Oh, what a\r\nthumper!\"\r\n\r\nAs the fish came struggling to the surface we leaned forward to see it,\r\nand overbalanced the log.  Peterkin threw his arms round the fish's\r\nneck, and in another instant we were all floundering in the water!\r\n\r\nA shout of laughter burst from us as we rose to the surface, like three\r\ndrowned rats, and seized hold of the log.  We soon recovered our\r\nposition, and sat more warily; while Peterkin secured the fish, which\r\nhad well-nigh escaped in the midst of our struggles.  It was little\r\nworth having, however.  But, as Peterkin remarked, it was better than\r\nthe smouts he had been catching for the last two or three days; so we\r\nlaid it on the log before us, and having re-baited the line, dropped it\r\nin again for another.\r\n\r\nNow, while we were thus intent upon our sport, our attention was\r\nsuddenly attracted by a ripple on the sea, just a few yards away from\r\nus.  Peterkin shouted to us to paddle in that direction, as he thought\r\nit was a big fish and we might have a chance of catching it.  But Jack,\r\ninstead of complying, said, in a deep, earnest tone of voice, which I\r\nnever before heard him use, \"Haul up your line, Peterkin; seize your\r\npaddle.  Quick--it's a shark!\"\r\n\r\nThe horror with which we heard this may well be imagined; for it must be\r\nremembered that our legs were hanging down in the water, and we could\r\nnot venture to pull them up without upsetting the log.  Peterkin\r\ninstantly hauled up the line, and grasping his paddle, exerted himself\r\nto the utmost, while we also did our best to make for shore.  But we\r\nwere a good way off, and the log being, as I have before said, very\r\nheavy, moved but slowly through the water.  We now saw the shark quite\r\ndistinctly swimming round and round us, its sharp fin every now and then\r\nprotruding above the water.  From its active and unsteady motions, Jack\r\nknew it was making up its mind to attack us; so he urged us vehemently\r\nto paddle for our lives, while he himself set us the example.  Suddenly\r\nhe shouted, \"Look out! there he comes!\" and in a second we saw the\r\nmonstrous fish dive close under us and turn half-over on his side.  But\r\nwe all made a great commotion with our paddles, which, no doubt,\r\nfrightened it away for that time, as we saw it immediately after\r\ncircling round us as before.\r\n\r\n\"Throw the fish to him!\" cried Jack in a quick, suppressed voice; \"we'll\r\nmake the shore in time yet if we can keep him off for a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin stopped one instant to obey the command, and then plied his\r\npaddle again with all his might.  No sooner had the fish fallen on the\r\nwater than we observed the shark to sink.  In another second we saw its\r\nwhite breast rising; for sharks always turn over on their sides when\r\nabout to seize their prey, their mouths being not at the point of their\r\nheads like those of other fish, but, as it were, under their chins.  In\r\nanother moment his snout rose above the water; his wide jaws, armed with\r\na terrific double row of teeth, appeared; the dead fish was engulfed,\r\nand the shark sank out of sight.  But Jack was mistaken in supposing\r\nthat it would be satisfied.  In a very few minutes it returned to us,\r\nand its quick motions led us to fear that it would attack us at once.\r\n\r\n\"Stop paddling!\" cried Jack suddenly.  \"I see it coming up behind us.\r\nNow, obey my orders _quickly_.  Our lives may depend on it.  Ralph--\r\nPeterkin--do your best to _balance the log_.  Don't look out for the\r\nshark.  Don't glance behind you.  Do nothing but balance the log.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin and I instantly did as we were ordered, being only too glad to\r\ndo anything that afforded us a chance or a hope of escape, for we had\r\nimplicit confidence in Jack's courage and wisdom.  For a few seconds,\r\nthat seemed long minutes to my mind, we sat thus silently; but I could\r\nnot resist glancing backward, despite the orders to the contrary.  On\r\ndoing so, I saw Jack sitting rigid like a statue, with his paddle\r\nraised, his lips compressed, and his eyebrows bent over his eyes, which\r\nglared savagely from beneath them down into the water.\r\n\r\nI also saw the shark, to my horror, quite close under the log, in the\r\nact of darting towards Jack's foot.  I could scarce suppress a cry on\r\nbeholding this.  In another moment the shark rose.  Jack drew his leg\r\nsuddenly from the water and threw it over the log.  The monster's snout\r\nrubbed against the log as it passed, and revealed its hideous jaws, into\r\nwhich Jack instantly plunged the paddle and thrust it down its throat.\r\nSo violent was this act that Jack rose to his feet in performing it; the\r\nlog was thereby rolled completely over, and we were once more plunged\r\ninto the water.  We all rose, spluttering and gasping, in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, strike out for shore!\" cried Jack.--\"Here, Peterkin, catch\r\nhold of my collar, and kick out with a will!\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin did as he was desired, and Jack struck out with such force that\r\nhe cut through the water like a boat; while I, being free from all\r\nencumbrance, succeeded in keeping up with him.  As we had by this time\r\ndrawn pretty near to the shore, a few minutes more sufficed to carry us\r\ninto shallow water; and finally, we landed in safety, though very much\r\nexhausted, and not a little frightened, by our terrible adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAUTIES OF THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA TEMPT PETERKIN TO DIVE--HOW HE DID\r\nIT--MORE DIFFICULTIES OVERCOME--THE WATER GARDEN--CURIOUS CREATURES OF\r\nTHE SEA--THE TANK--CANDLES MISSED VERY MUCH, AND THE CANDLE-NUT TREE\r\nDISCOVERED--WONDERFUL ACCOUNT OF PETERKIN'S FIRST VOYAGE--CLOTH FOUND\r\nGROWING ON A TREE--A PLAN PROJECTED, AND ARMS PREPARED FOR OFFENCE AND\r\nDEFENCE--A DREADFUL CRY.\r\n\r\nOur encounter with the shark was the first great danger that had\r\nbefallen us since landing on this island; and we felt very seriously\r\naffected by it, especially when we considered that we had so often\r\nunwittingly incurred the same danger before while bathing.  We were now\r\nforced to take to fishing again in the shallow water until we should\r\nsucceed in constructing a raft.  What troubled us most, however, was\r\nthat we were compelled to forego our morning swimming-excursions.  We\r\ndid, indeed, continue to enjoy our bathe in the shallow water; but Jack\r\nand I found that one great source of our enjoyment was gone when we\r\ncould no longer dive down among the beautiful coral groves at the bottom\r\nof the lagoon.  We had come to be so fond of this exercise, and to take\r\nsuch an interest in watching the formations of coral and the gambols of\r\nthe many beautiful fish amongst the forest of red and green seaweeds,\r\nthat we had become quite familiar with the appearance of the fish and\r\nthe localities that they chiefly haunted.  We had also become expert\r\ndivers.  But we made it a rule never to stay long under water at a time.\r\nJack told me that to do so often was bad for the lungs, and instead of\r\naffording us enjoyment, would ere long do us a serious injury.  So we\r\nnever stayed at the bottom as long as we might have done, but came up\r\nfrequently to the top for fresh air, and dived down again immediately.\r\nSometimes, when Jack happened to be in a humorous frame, he would seat\r\nhimself at the bottom of the sea on one of the brain-corals, as if he\r\nwere seated on a large paddock-stool, and then make faces at me in\r\norder, if possible, to make me laugh under water.  At first, when he\r\ntook me unawares, he nearly succeeded, and I had to shoot to the surface\r\nin order to laugh; but afterwards I became aware of his intentions, and\r\nbeing naturally of a grave disposition, I had no difficulty in\r\nrestraining myself.  I used often to wonder how poor Peterkin would have\r\nliked to be with us; and he sometimes expressed much regret at being\r\nunable to join us.  I used to do my best to gratify him, poor fellow, by\r\nrelating all the wonders that we saw; but this, instead of satisfying,\r\nseemed only to whet his curiosity the more, so one day we prevailed on\r\nhim to try to go down with us.  But although a brave boy in every other\r\nway, Peterkin was very nervous in the water; and it was with difficulty\r\nwe got him to consent to be taken down, for he could never have managed\r\nto push himself down to the bottom without assistance.  But no sooner\r\nhad we pulled him down a yard or so into the deep, clear water than he\r\nbegan to struggle and kick violently; so we were forced to let him go,\r\nwhen he rose out of the water like a cork, gave a loud gasp and a\r\nfrightful roar, and struck out for the land with the utmost possible\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\nNow all this pleasure we were to forego, and when we thought thereon,\r\nJack and I felt very much depressed in our spirits.  I could see, also,\r\nthat Peterkin grieved and sympathised with us; for, when talking about\r\nthis matter, he refrained from jesting and bantering us upon it.\r\n\r\nAs, however, a man's difficulties usually set him upon devising methods\r\nto overcome them, whereby he often discovers better things than those he\r\nmay have lost, so this our difficulty induced us to think of searching\r\nfor a large pool among the rocks, where the water should be deep enough\r\nfor diving, yet so surrounded by rocks as to prevent sharks from getting\r\nat us.  And such a pool we afterwards found, which proved to be very\r\nmuch better than our most sanguine hopes anticipated.  It was situated\r\nnot more than ten minutes' walk from our camp, and was in the form of a\r\nsmall, deep bay or basin, the entrance to which, besides being narrow,\r\nwas so shallow that no fish so large as a shark could get in--at least,\r\nnot unless he should be a remarkably thin one.\r\n\r\nInside of this basin, which we called our Water Garden, the coral\r\nformations were much more wonderful, and the seaweed plants far more\r\nlovely and vividly coloured, than in the lagoon itself.  And the water\r\nwas so clear and still that, although very deep, you could see the\r\nminutest object at the bottom.  Besides this, there was a ledge of rock\r\nwhich overhung the basin at its deepest part, from which we could dive\r\npleasantly, and whereon Peterkin could sit and see not only all the\r\nwonders I had described to him, but also see Jack and me creeping\r\namongst the marine shrubbery at the bottom, like--as he expressed\r\nit--\"two great white sea-monsters.\"  During these excursions of ours to\r\nthe bottom of the sea we began to get an insight into the manners and\r\ncustoms of its inhabitants, and to make discoveries of wonderful things,\r\nthe like of which we never before conceived.  Among other things, we\r\nwere deeply interested with the operations of the little coral insect,\r\nwhich, I was informed by Jack, is supposed to have entirely constructed\r\nmany of the numerous islands in the Pacific Ocean.  And certainly, when\r\nwe considered the great reef which these insects had formed round the\r\nisland on which we were cast, and observed their ceaseless activity in\r\nbuilding their myriad cells, it did at first seem as if this might be\r\ntrue; but then, again, when I looked at the mountains of the island, and\r\nreflected that there were thousands of such (many of them much higher)\r\nin the South Seas, I doubted that there must be some mistake here.  But\r\nmore of this hereafter.\r\n\r\nI also became much taken up with the manners and appearance of the\r\nanemones, and starfish, and crabs, and sea-urchins, and such-like\r\ncreatures; and was not content with watching those I saw during my dives\r\nin the Water Garden, but I must needs scoop out a hole in the coral rock\r\nclose to it, which I filled with salt water, and stocked with sundry\r\nspecimens of anemones and shell-fish, in order to watch more closely how\r\nthey were in the habit of passing their time.  Our burning-glass, also,\r\nnow became a great treasure to me, as it enabled me to magnify, and so\r\nto perceive more clearly, the forms and actions of these curious\r\ncreatures of the deep.\r\n\r\nHaving now got ourselves into a very comfortable condition, we began to\r\ntalk of a project which we had long had in contemplation--namely, to\r\ntravel entirely round the island, in order, first, to ascertain whether\r\nit contained any other productions which might be useful to us; and,\r\nsecond, to see whether there might be any place more convenient and\r\nsuitable for our permanent residence than that on which we were now\r\nencamped.  Not that we were in any degree dissatisfied with it.  On the\r\ncontrary, we entertained quite a home-feeling to our bower and its\r\nneighbourhood; but if a better place did exist, there was no reason why\r\nwe should not make use of it.  At any rate, it would be well to know of\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\nWe had much earnest talk over this matter.  But Jack proposed that,\r\nbefore undertaking such an excursion, we should supply ourselves with\r\ngood defensive arms; for, as we intended not only to go round all the\r\nshore, but to descend most of the valleys, before returning home, we\r\nshould be likely to meet in with--he would not say _dangers_--but at\r\nleast with everything that existed on the island, whatever that might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said Jack, \"it won't do for us to live on cocoa-nuts and\r\noysters always.  No doubt they are very excellent in their way, but I\r\nthink a little animal food now and then would be agreeable as well as\r\ngood for us; and as there are many small birds among the trees, some of\r\nwhich are probably very good to eat, I think it would be a capital plan\r\nto make bows and arrows, with which we could easily knock them over.\"\r\n\r\n\"First-rate!\" cried Peterkin.  \"You will make the bows, Jack, and I'll\r\ntry my hand at the arrows.  The fact is, I'm quite tired of throwing\r\nstones at the birds.  I began the very day we landed, I think, and have\r\npersevered up to the present time, but I've never hit anything yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" said I, \"you hit me one day on the shin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, true!\" replied Peterkin; \"and a precious shindy you kicked up in\r\nconsequence.  But you were at least four yards away from the impudent\r\nparoquet I aimed at, so you see what a horribly bad shot I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Jack,\" said I, \"you cannot make three bows and arrows before\r\nto-morrow; and would it not be a pity to waste time, now that we have\r\nmade up our minds to go on this expedition?--Suppose that you make one\r\nbow and arrow for yourself, and we can take our clubs?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true, Ralph.  The day is pretty far advanced, and I doubt if I\r\ncan make even one bow before dark.  To be sure, I might work by\r\nfirelight after the sun goes down.\"\r\n\r\nWe had, up to this time, been in the habit of going to bed with the sun,\r\nas we had no pressing call to work o' nights; and, indeed, our work\r\nduring the day was usually hard enough--what between fishing, and\r\nimproving our bower, and diving in the Water Garden, and rambling in the\r\nwoods--so that when night came we were usually very glad to retire to\r\nour beds.  But now that we had a desire to work at night, we felt a wish\r\nfor candles.\r\n\r\n\"Won't a good blazing fire give you light enough?\" inquired Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Jack, \"quite enough; but then it will give us a great\r\ndeal more than enough of heat in this warm climate of ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Peterkin; \"I forgot that.  It would roast us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as you're always doing that at any rate,\" remarked Jack, \"we\r\ncould scarcely call it a change.  But the fact is, I've been thinking\r\nover this subject before.  There is a certain nut growing in these\r\nislands which is called the candle-nut, because the natives use it\r\ninstead of candles; and I know all about it, and how to prepare it for\r\nburning--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why don't you do it?\" interrupted Peterkin.  \"Why have you kept us\r\nin the dark so long, you vile philosopher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Jack, \"I have not seen the tree yet, and I'm not sure\r\nthat I should know either the tree or the nuts if I did see them.  You\r\nsee, I forget the description.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's just the way with me,\" said Peterkin with a deep sigh.  \"I\r\nnever could keep in my mind for half-an-hour the few descriptions I ever\r\nattempted to remember.  The very first voyage I ever made was caused by\r\nmy mistaking a description--or forgetting it, which is the same thing.\r\nAnd a horrible voyage it was.  I had to fight with the captain the whole\r\nway out, and made the homeward voyage by swimming!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Peterkin,\" said I, \"you can't get even _me_ to believe that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, but it's true notwithstanding,\" returned Peterkin,\r\npretending to be hurt at my doubting his word.\r\n\r\n\"Let us hear how it happened,\" said Jack, while a good-natured smile\r\noverspread his face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you must know,\" began Peterkin, \"that the very day before I went\r\nto sea I was greatly taken up with a game at hockey, which I was playing\r\nwith my old school-fellows for the last time before leaving them.--You\r\nsee I was young then, Ralph.\"  Peterkin gazed, in an abstracted and\r\nmelancholy manner, out to sea.--\"Well, in the midst of the game, my\r\nuncle, who had taken all the bother and trouble of getting me bound\r\n'prentice and rigged out, came and took me aside, and told me that he\r\nwas called suddenly away from home, and would not be able to see me\r\naboard, as he had intended.  `However,' said he, `the captain knows you\r\nare coming, so that's not of much consequence; but as you'll have to\r\nfind the ship yourself, you must remember her name and description.\r\nD'ye hear, boy?'  I certainly did hear, but I'm afraid I did not\r\nunderstand; for my mind was so taken up with the game, which I saw my\r\nside was losing, that I began to grow impatient, and the moment my uncle\r\nfinished his description of the ship and bade me good-bye I bolted back\r\nto my game, with only a confused idea of three masts, and a\r\ngreen-painted taffrail, and a gilt figurehead of Hercules with his club\r\nat the bow.  Next day I was so much cast down with everybody saying\r\ngood-bye, and a lot o' my female friends cryin' horribly over me, that I\r\ndid not start for the harbour, where the ship was lying among a thousand\r\nothers, till it was almost too late.  So I had to run the whole way.\r\nWhen I reached the pier, there were so many masts, and so much\r\nconfusion, that I felt quite humble-bumbled in my faculties.  `Now,'\r\nsaid I to myself, `Peterkin, you're in a fix.'  Then I fancied I saw a\r\ngilt figurehead and three masts belonging to a ship just about to start;\r\nso I darted on board, but speedily jumped on shore again when I found\r\nthat two of the masts belonged to another vessel and the figurehead to a\r\nthird!  At last I caught sight of what I made sure was it--a fine large\r\nvessel just casting off her moorings.  The taffrail was green.  Three\r\nmasts--yes, that must be it--and the gilt figurehead of Hercules.  To be\r\nsure, it had a three-pronged pitchfork in its hand instead of a club;\r\nbut that might be my uncle's mistake, or perhaps Hercules sometimes\r\nvaried his weapons.  `Cast off!' roared a voice from the quarter-deck.\r\n`Hold on!' cried I, rushing frantically through the crowd.  `Hold on!\r\nhold on!' repeated some of the bystanders, while the men at the ropes\r\ndelayed for a minute.  This threw the captain into a frightful rage; for\r\nsome of his friends had come down to see him off, and having his orders\r\ncontradicted so flatly was too much for him.  However, the delay was\r\nsufficient.  I took a race and a good leap; the ropes were cast off; the\r\nsteam-tug gave a puff, and we started.  Suddenly the captain walks up to\r\nme: `Where did you come from, you scamp, and what do you want here?'\r\n\r\n\"`Please, sir,' said I, touching my cap, `I'm your new 'prentice come\r\naboard.'\r\n\r\n\"`New 'prentice!' said he, stamping; `I've got no new 'prentice.  My\r\nboys are all aboard already.  This is a trick, you young blackguard!\r\nYou've run away, you have!'  And the captain stamped about the deck and\r\nswore dreadfully; for, you see, the thought of having to stop the ship\r\nand lower a boat and lose half-an-hour, all for the sake of sending a\r\nsmall boy ashore, seemed to make him very angry.  Besides, it was\r\nblowin' fresh outside the harbour, so that to have let the steamer\r\nalongside to put me into it was no easy job.  Just as we were passing\r\nthe pier-head, where several boats were rowing into the harbour, the\r\ncaptain came up to me.\r\n\r\n\"`You've run away, you blackguard!' he said, giving me a box on the ear.\r\n\r\n\"`No, I haven't!' said I angrily, for the box was by no means a light\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"`Hark'ee, boy, can you swim?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"`Then do it!' and seizing me by my trousers and the nape of my neck, he\r\ntossed me over the side into the sea.  The fellows in the boats at the\r\nend of the pier backed their oars on seeing this; but observing that I\r\ncould swim, they allowed me to make the best of my way to the\r\npier-head.--So you see, Ralph, that I really did swim my first homeward\r\nvoyage.\"\r\n\r\nJack laughed, and patted Peterkin on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"But tell us about the candle-nut tree,\" said I.  \"You were talking\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" said Jack; \"but I fear I can remember little about it.  I\r\nbelieve the nut is about the size of a walnut; and I think that the\r\nleaves are white, but I am not sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh! ha! hum!\" exclaimed Peterkin; \"I saw a tree answering to that\r\ndescription this very day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\" cried Jack.  \"Is it far from this?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not half-a-mile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then lead me to it,\" said Jack, seizing his axe.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes we were all three pushing through the underwood of the\r\nforest, headed by Peterkin.\r\n\r\nWe soon came to the tree in question, which, after Jack had closely\r\nexamined it, we concluded must be the candle-nut tree.  Its leaves were\r\nof a beautiful silvery white, and formed a fine contrast to the\r\ndark-green foliage of the surrounding trees.  We immediately filled our\r\npockets with the nuts, after which Jack said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Peterkin, climb that cocoa-nut tree and cut me one of the long\r\nbranches.\"\r\n\r\nThis was soon done; but it cost some trouble, for the stem was very\r\nhigh, and as Peterkin usually pulled nuts from the younger trees, he was\r\nnot much accustomed to climbing the high ones.  The leaf or branch was a\r\nvery large one, and we were surprised at its size and strength.  Viewed\r\nfrom a little distance, the cocoa-nut tree seems to be a tall, straight\r\nstem, without a single branch except at the top, where there is a tuft\r\nof feathery-looking leaves that seem to wave like soft plumes in the\r\nwind.  But when we saw one of these leaves or branches at our feet, we\r\nfound it to be a strong stalk, about fifteen feet long, with a number of\r\nnarrow, pointed leaflets ranged alternately on each side.  But what\r\nseemed to us the most wonderful thing about it was a curious substance\r\nresembling cloth, which was wrapped round the thick end of the stalk\r\nwhere it had been cut from the tree.  Peterkin told us that he had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in separating the branch from the stem on account of\r\nthis substance, as it was wrapped quite round the tree, and, he\r\nobserved, round all the other branches, thus forming a strong support to\r\nthe large leaves while exposed to high winds.  When I call this\r\nsubstance cloth I do not exaggerate.  Indeed, with regard to all the\r\nthings I saw during my eventful career in the South Seas, I have been\r\nexceedingly careful not to exaggerate, or in any way to mislead or\r\ndeceive my readers.  This cloth, I say, was remarkably like to coarse\r\nbrown cotton cloth.  It had a seam or fibre down the centre of it, from\r\nwhich diverged other fibres, about the size of a bristle.  There were\r\ntwo layers of these fibres, very long and tough, the one layer crossing\r\nthe other obliquely, and the whole was cemented together with a still\r\nfiner fibrous and adhesive substance.  When we regarded it attentively,\r\nwe could with difficulty believe that it had not been woven by human\r\nhands.  This remarkable piece of cloth we stripped carefully off, and\r\nfound it to be above two feet long by a foot broad, and we carried it\r\nhome with us as a great prize.\r\n\r\nJack now took one of the leaflets, and cutting out the central spine or\r\nstalk, hurried back with it to our camp.  Having made a small fire, he\r\nbaked the nuts slightly and then peeled off the husks.  After this he\r\nwished to bore a hole in them, which, not having anything better at hand\r\nat the time, he did with the point of our useless pencil-case.  Then he\r\nstrung them on the cocoa-nut spine, and on putting a light to the\r\ntopmost nut we found, to our joy, that it burned with a clear, beautiful\r\nflame, upon seeing which Peterkin sprang up and danced round the fire\r\nfor at least five minutes in the excess of his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack, extinguishing our candle, \"the sun will set in\r\nan hour, so we have no time to lose.  I shall go and cut a young tree to\r\nmake my bow out of, and you had better each of you go and select good\r\nstrong sticks for clubs, and we'll set to work at them after dark.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he shouldered his axe and went off; followed by Peterkin;\r\nwhile I took up the piece of newly discovered cloth, and fell to\r\nexamining its structure.  So engrossed was I in this that I was still\r\nsitting in the same attitude and occupation when my companions returned.\r\n\r\n\"I told you so!\" cried Peterkin with a loud laugh.--\"Oh Ralph, you're\r\nincorrigible!  See, there's a club for you.  I was sure, when we left\r\nyou looking at that bit of stuff, that we would find you poring over it\r\nwhen we came back, so I just cut a club for you as well as for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Peterkin,\" said I.  \"It was kind of you to do that instead\r\nof scolding me for a lazy fellow, as I confess I deserve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as to that,\" returned Peterkin, \"I'll blow you up yet if you wish\r\nit; only it would be of no use if I did, for you're a perfect mule!\"\r\n\r\nAs it was now getting dark we lighted our candle, and placing it in a\r\nholder made of two crossing branches inside of our bower, we seated\r\nourselves on our leafy beds and began to work.\r\n\r\n\"I intend to appropriate the bow for my own use,\" said Jack, chipping\r\nthe piece of wood he had brought with his axe.  \"I used to be a pretty\r\nfair shot once.--But what's that you're doing?\" he added, looking at\r\nPeterkin, who had drawn the end of a long pole into the tent, and was\r\nendeavouring to fit a small piece of the hoop-iron to the end of it.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to enlist into the Lancers,\" answered Peterkin.  \"You see,\r\nJack, I find the club rather an unwieldy instrument for my delicately\r\nformed muscles, and I flatter myself I shall do more execution with a\r\nspear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if length constitutes power,\" said Jack, \"you'll certainly be\r\ninvincible.\"\r\n\r\nThe pole which Peterkin had cut was full twelve feet long, being a very\r\nstrong but light and tough young tree, which merely required thinning at\r\nthe butt to be a serviceable weapon.\r\n\r\n\"That's a very good idea,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Which--this?\" inquired Peterkin, pointing to the spear.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said he; \"you'd find it a pretty tough and matter-of-fact idea\r\nif you had it stuck through your gizzard, old boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean the idea of making it is a good one,\" said I, laughing.  \"And,\r\nnow I think of it, I'll change my plan too.  I don't think much of a\r\nclub, so I'll make me a sling out of this piece of cloth.  I used to be\r\nvery fond of slinging, ever since I read of David slaying Goliath the\r\nPhilistine, and I was once thought to be expert at it.\"\r\n\r\nSo I set to work to manufacture a sling.  For a long time we all worked\r\nvery busily without speaking.  At length Peterkin looked up.  \"I say,\r\nJack, I'm sorry to say I must apply to you for another strip of your\r\nhandkerchief to tie on this rascally head with.  It's pretty well torn\r\nat any rate, so you won't miss it.\"\r\n\r\nJack proceeded to comply with this request, when Peterkin suddenly laid\r\nhis hand on his arm and arrested him.\r\n\r\n\"Hist, man!\" said he; \"be tender!  You should never be needlessly cruel\r\nif you can help it.  Do try to shave past Lord Nelson's mouth without\r\ntearing it, if possible!  Thanks.  There are plenty more handkerchiefs\r\non the cocoa-nut trees.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Peterkin! with what pleasant feelings I recall and record his jests\r\nand humorous sayings now!\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus engaged we were startled by a distant, but most\r\nstrange and horrible, cry.  It seemed to come from the sea, but was so\r\nfar away that we could not clearly distinguish its precise direction.\r\nRushing out of our bower, we hastened down to the beach and stayed to\r\nlisten.  Again it came, quite loud and distinct on the night air--a\r\nprolonged, hideous cry, something like the braying of an ass.  The moon\r\nhad risen, and we could see the islands in and beyond the lagoon quite\r\nplainly; but there was no object visible to account for such a cry.  A\r\nstrong gust of wind was blowing from the point whence the sound came,\r\nbut this died away while we were gazing out to sea.\r\n\r\n\"What can it be?\" said Peterkin in a low whisper, while we all\r\ninvoluntarily crept closer to each other.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said Jack, \"I have heard that mysterious sound twice\r\nbefore, but never so loud as to-night.  Indeed, it was so faint that I\r\nthought I must have merely fancied it; so, as I did not wish to alarm\r\nyou, I said nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\nWe listened for a long time for the sound again; but as it did not come,\r\nwe returned to the bower and resumed our work.\r\n\r\n\"Very strange!\" said Peterkin quite gravely.--\"Do you believe in ghosts,\r\nRalph?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I answered, \"I do not.  Nevertheless, I must confess that strange,\r\nunaccountable sounds, such as we have just heard, make me feel a little\r\nuneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you to it, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"I neither believe in ghosts nor feel uneasy,\" he replied.  \"I never saw\r\na ghost myself, and I never met with any one who had; and I have\r\ngenerally found that strange and unaccountable things have almost always\r\nbeen accounted for, and found to be quite simple, on close examination.\r\nI certainly can't imagine what _that_ sound is; but I'm quite sure I\r\nshall find out before long, and if it's a ghost I'll--I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat it!\" cried Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'll eat it!--Now, then, my bow and two arrows are finished; so,\r\nif you're ready, we had better turn in.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Peterkin had thinned down his spear, and tied an iron point\r\nvery cleverly to the end of it; I had formed a sling, the lines of which\r\nwere composed of thin strips of the cocoa-nut cloth, plaited; and Jack\r\nhad made a stout bow, nearly five feet long, with two arrows, feathered\r\nwith two or three large plumes which some bird had dropped.  They had no\r\nbarbs; but Jack said that if arrows were well feathered they did not\r\nrequire iron points, but would fly quite well if merely sharpened at the\r\npoint, which I did not know before.\r\n\r\n\"A feathered arrow without a barb,\" said he, \"is a good weapon, but a\r\nbarbed arrow without feathers is utterly useless.\"\r\n\r\nThe string of the bow was formed of our piece of whip-cord, part of\r\nwhich, as he did not like to cut it, was rolled round the bow.\r\n\r\nAlthough thus prepared for a start on the morrow we thought it wise to\r\nexercise ourselves a little in the use of our weapons before starting,\r\nso we spent the whole of the next day in practising.  And it was well we\r\ndid so, for we found that our arms were very imperfect, and that we were\r\nfar from perfect in the use of them.  First, Jack found that the bow was\r\nmuch too strong, and he had to thin it.  Also the spear was much too\r\nheavy, and so had to be reduced in thickness, although nothing would\r\ninduce Peterkin to have it shortened.  My sling answered very well; but\r\nI had fallen so much out of practice that my first stone knocked off\r\nPeterkin's hat, and narrowly missed making a second Goliath of him.\r\nHowever, after having spent the whole day in diligent practice, we began\r\nto find some of our former expertness returning, at least Jack and I\r\ndid.  As for Peterkin, being naturally a neat-handed boy, he soon\r\nhandled his spear well, and could run full tilt at a cocoa-nut, and hit\r\nit with great precision once out of every five times.\r\n\r\nBut I feel satisfied that we owed much of our rapid success to the\r\nunflagging energy of Jack, who insisted that since we had made him\r\ncaptain, we should obey him; and he kept us at work from morning till\r\nnight, perseveringly, at the same thing.  Peterkin wished very much to\r\nrun about and stick his spear into everything he passed; but Jack put up\r\na cocoa-nut, and would not let him leave off running at that for a\r\nmoment except when he wanted to rest.  We laughed at Jack for this, but\r\nwe were both convinced that it did us much good.\r\n\r\nThat night we examined and repaired our arms ere we lay down to rest,\r\nalthough we were much fatigued, in order that we might be in readiness\r\nto set out on our expedition at daylight on the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nPREPARE FOR A JOURNEY ROUND THE ISLAND--SAGACIOUS REFLECTIONS--\r\nMYSTERIOUS APPEARANCES AND STARTLING OCCURRENCES.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the sun shot its first ray across the bosom of the broad\r\nPacific when Jack sprang to his feet, and hallooing in Peterkin's ear to\r\nawaken him, ran down the beach to take his customary dip in the sea.  We\r\ndid not, as was our wont, bathe that morning in our Water Garden, but in\r\norder to save time, refreshed ourselves in the shallow water just\r\nopposite the bower.  Our breakfast was also despatched without loss of\r\ntime, and in less than an hour afterwards all our preparations for the\r\njourney were completed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his ordinary dress, Jack tied a belt of cocoa-nut cloth\r\nround his waist, into which he thrust the axe.  I was also advised to\r\nput on a belt and carry a short cudgel or bludgeon in it, for, as Jack\r\ntruly remarked, the sling would be of little use if we should chance to\r\ncome to close quarters with any wild animal.  As for Peterkin,\r\nnotwithstanding that he carried such a long and, I must add,\r\nfrightful-looking spear over his shoulder, we could not prevail on him\r\nto leave his club behind; \"for,\" said he, \"a spear at close quarters is\r\nnot worth a button.\"  I must say that it seemed to me that the club was,\r\nto use his own style of language, not worth a button-hole; for it was\r\nall knotted over at the head, something like the club which I remember\r\nto have observed in picture-books of Jack the Giant-killer, besides\r\nbeing so heavy that he required to grasp it with both hands in order to\r\nwield it at all.  However, he took it with him, and in this manner we\r\nset out upon our travels.\r\n\r\nWe did not consider it necessary to carry any food with us, as we knew\r\nthat wherever we went we should be certain to fall in with cocoa-nut\r\ntrees--having which we were amply supplied, as Peterkin said, with meat\r\nand drink and pocket-handkerchiefs!  I took the precaution, however, to\r\nput the burning-glass into my pocket lest we should want fire.\r\n\r\nThe morning was exceedingly lovely.  It was one of that very still and\r\npeaceful sort which made the few noises that we heard seem to be quiet\r\nnoises (I know no other way of expressing this idea)--noises which, so\r\nfar from interrupting the universal tranquillity of earth, sea, and sky,\r\nrather tended to reveal to us how quiet the world round us really was.\r\nSuch sounds as I refer to were the peculiar, melancholy--yet, it seemed\r\nto me, cheerful--plaint of sea-birds floating on the glassy waters or\r\nsailing in the sky; also the subdued twittering of little birds among\r\nthe bushes, the faint ripples on the beach, and the solemn boom of the\r\nsurf upon the distant coral reef.  We felt very glad in our hearts as we\r\nwalked along the sands, side by side.  For my part, I felt so deeply\r\noverjoyed that I was surprised at my own sensations, and fell into a\r\nreverie upon the causes of happiness.  I came to the conclusion that a\r\nstate of profound peace and repose, both in regard to outward objects\r\nand within the soul, is the happiest condition in which man can be\r\nplaced; for although I had many a time been most joyful and happy when\r\nengaged in bustling, energetic, active pursuits or amusements, I never\r\nfound that such joy or satisfaction was so deep or so pleasant to\r\nreflect upon as that which I now experienced.  And I was the more\r\nconfirmed in this opinion when I observed--and, indeed, as told by\r\nhimself--that Peterkin's happiness was also very great; yet he did not\r\nexpress this by dancing, as was his wont, nor did he give so much as a\r\nsingle shout, but walked quietly between us with his eye sparkling and a\r\njoyful smile upon his countenance.  My reader must not suppose that I\r\nthought all this in the clear and methodical manner in which I have set\r\nit down here.  These thoughts did indeed pass through my mind; but they\r\ndid so in a very confused and indefinite manner, for I was young at that\r\ntime and not much given to deep reflections.  Neither did I consider\r\nthat the peace whereof I write is not to be found in this world--at\r\nleast in its perfection--although I have since learned that, by\r\nreligion, a man may attain to a very great degree of it.\r\n\r\nI have said that Peterkin walked along the sands between us.  We had two\r\nways of walking together about our island.  When we travelled through\r\nthe woods we always did so in single file, as by this method we advanced\r\nwith greater facility, the one treading in the other's footsteps.  In\r\nsuch cases Jack always took the lead, Peterkin followed, and I brought\r\nup the rear.  But when we travelled along the sands, which extended\r\nalmost in an unbroken line of glistening white round the island, we\r\nmarched abreast, as we found this method more sociable and every way\r\nmore pleasant.  Jack, being the tallest, walked next the sea, and\r\nPeterkin marched between us, as by this arrangement either of us could\r\ntalk to him or he to us, while if Jack and I happened to wish to\r\nconverse together we could conveniently do so over Peterkin's head.\r\nPeterkin used to say, in reference to this arrangement, that had he been\r\nas tall as either of us, our order of march might have been the same;\r\nfor, as Jack often used to scold him for letting everything we said to\r\nhim pass in at one ear and out at the other, his head could, of course,\r\nform no interruption to our discourse.\r\n\r\nWe were now fairly started.  Half-a-mile's walk conveyed us round a bend\r\nin the land which shut out our bower from view, and for some time we\r\nadvanced at a brisk pace without speaking, though our eyes were not\r\nidle, but noted everything--in the woods, on the shore, or in the sea--\r\nthat was interesting.  After passing the ridge of land that formed one\r\nside of our valley--the Valley of the Wreck--we beheld another small\r\nvale lying before us in all the luxuriant loveliness of tropical\r\nvegetation.  We had indeed seen it before from the mountain-top, but we\r\nhad no idea that it would turn out to be so much more lovely when we\r\nwere close to it.  We were about to commence the exploration of this\r\nvalley when Peterkin stopped us, and directed our attention to a very\r\nremarkable appearance in advance along the shore.\r\n\r\n\"What's yon, think you?\" said he, levelling his spear as if he expected\r\nan immediate attack from the object in question, though it was full\r\nhalf-a-mile distant.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, there appeared a white column above the rocks, as if of\r\nsteam or spray.  It rose upwards to a height of several feet, and then\r\ndisappeared.  Had this been near the sea, we would not have been so\r\ngreatly surprised, as it might in that case have been the surf, for at\r\nthis part of the coast the coral reef approached so near to the island\r\nthat in some parts it almost joined it.  There was, therefore, no lagoon\r\nbetween, and the heavy surf of the ocean beat almost up to the rocks.\r\nBut this white column appeared about fifty yards inland.  The rocks at\r\nthe place were rugged, and they stretched across the sandy beach into\r\nthe sea.  Scarce had we ceased expressing our surprise at this sight\r\nwhen another column flew upwards for a few seconds, not far from the\r\nspot where the first had been seen, and disappeared; and so, at long,\r\nirregular intervals, these strange sights recurred.  We were now quite\r\nsure that the columns were watery, or composed of spray; but what caused\r\nthem we could not guess, so we determined to go and see.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes we gained the spot, which was very rugged and\r\nprecipitous, and, moreover, quite damp with the falling of the spray.\r\nWe had much ado to pass over dry-shod.  The ground, also, was full of\r\nholes here and there.  Now, while we stood anxiously waiting for the\r\nreappearance of these waterspouts, we heard a low, rumbling sound near\r\nus, which quickly increased to a gurgling and hissing noise, and a\r\nmoment afterwards a thick spout of water burst upwards from a hole in\r\nthe rock and spouted into the air with much violence, and so close to\r\nwhere Jack and I were standing that it nearly touched us.  We sprang\r\naside, but not before a cloud of spray descended and drenched us both to\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\nPeterkin, who was standing farther off; escaped with a few drops, and\r\nburst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter on beholding our miserable\r\nplight.\r\n\r\n\"Mind your eye!\" he shouted eagerly; \"there goes another!\"  The words\r\nwere scarcely out of his mouth when there came up a spout from another\r\nhole, which served us exactly in the same manner as before.\r\n\r\nPeterkin now shrieked with laughter; but his merriment was abruptly put\r\na stop to by the gurgling noise occurring close to where he stood.\r\n\r\n\"Where'll it spout this time, I wonder?\" he said, looking about with\r\nsome anxiety and preparing to run.  Suddenly there came a loud hiss or\r\nsnort; a fierce spout of water burst up between Peterkin's legs, blew\r\nhim off his feet, enveloped him in its spray, and hurled him to the\r\nground.  He fell with so much violence that we feared he must have\r\nbroken some of his bones, and ran anxiously to his assistance; but\r\nfortunately he had fallen on a clump of tangled herbage, in which he lay\r\nsprawling in a most deplorable condition.\r\n\r\nIt was now our turn to laugh; but as we were not yet quite sure that he\r\nwas unhurt, and as we knew not when or where the next spout might arise,\r\nwe assisted him hastily to jump up and hurry from the spot.\r\n\r\nI may here add that, although I am quite certain that the spout of water\r\nwas very strong, and that it blew Peterkin completely off his legs, I am\r\nnot quite certain of the exact height to which it lifted him, being\r\nsomewhat startled by the event, and blinded partially by the spray, so\r\nthat my power of observation was somewhat impaired for the moment.\r\n\r\n\"What's to be done now?\" asked Peterkin ruefully.\r\n\r\n\"Make a fire, lad, and dry ourselves,\" replied Jack.\r\n\r\n\"And here is material ready to our hand,\" said I, picking up a dried\r\nbranch of a tree as we hurried up to the woods.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour after this mishap our clothes were again dried.  While\r\nthey were hanging up before the fire we walked down to the beach, and\r\nsoon observed that these curious spouts took place immediately after the\r\nfall of a huge wave, never before it; and, moreover, that the spouts did\r\nnot take place excepting when the billow was an extremely large one.\r\nFrom this we concluded that there must be a subterraneous channel in the\r\nrock into which the water was driven by the larger waves, and finding no\r\nway of escape except through these small holes, was thus forced up\r\nviolently through them.  At any rate, we could not conceive any other\r\nreason for these strange waterspouts, and as this seemed a very simple\r\nand probable one, we forthwith adopted it.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Ralph, what's that in the water?  Is it a shark?\" said Jack just\r\nas we were about to quit the place.\r\n\r\nI immediately ran to the overhanging ledge of rock, from which he was\r\nlooking down into the sea, and bent over it.  There I saw a very faint,\r\npale object of a greenish colour, which seemed to move slightly while I\r\nlooked at it.\r\n\r\n\"It's like a fish of some sort,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Peterkin!\" cried Jack.  \"Fetch your spear; here's work for it!\"\r\n\r\nBut when we tried to reach the object, the spear proved to be too short.\r\n\r\n\"There, now,\" said Peterkin with a sneer; \"you were always telling me it\r\nwas too long.\"\r\n\r\nJack now drove the spear forcibly towards the object, and let go his\r\nhold.  But although it seemed to be well aimed, he must have missed, for\r\nthe handle soon rose again; and when the spear was drawn up, there was\r\nthe pale-green object in exactly the same spot, slowly moving its tail.\r\n\r\n\"Very odd!\" said Jack.\r\n\r\nBut although it was undoubtedly very odd, and although Jack and all of\r\nus plunged the spear at it repeatedly, we could neither hit it nor drive\r\nit away, so we were compelled to continue our journey without\r\ndiscovering what it was.  I was very much perplexed at this strange\r\nappearance in the water, and could not get it out of my mind for a long\r\ntime afterwards.  However, I quieted myself by resolving that I would\r\npay a visit to it again at some more convenient season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nMAKE DISCOVERY OF MANY EXCELLENT ROOTS AND FRUITS--THE RESOURCES OF THE\r\nCORAL ISLAND GRADUALLY UNFOLDED--THE BANYAN TREE--ANOTHER TREE WHICH IS\r\nSUPPORTED BY NATURAL PLANKS--WATER-FOWL FOUND--A VERY REMARKABLE\r\nDISCOVERY, AND A VERY PECULIAR MURDER--WE LUXURIATE ON THE FAT OF THE\r\nLAND.\r\n\r\nOur examination of the little valley proved to be altogether most\r\nsatisfactory.  We found in it not only similar trees to those we had\r\nalready seen in our own valley, but also one or two others of a\r\ndifferent species.  We had also the satisfaction of discovering a\r\npeculiar vegetable, which, Jack concluded, must certainly be that of\r\nwhich he had read as being very common among the South Sea Islanders,\r\nand which was named taro.  Also we found a large supply of yams, and\r\nanother root like a potato in appearance.  As these were all quite new\r\nto us, we regarded our lot as a most fortunate one, in being thus cast\r\non an island which was so prolific and so well stored with all the\r\nnecessaries of life.  Long afterwards we found out that this island of\r\nours was no better in these respects than thousands of other islands in\r\nthose seas.  Indeed, many of them were much richer and more productive;\r\nbut that did not render us the less grateful for our present good\r\nfortune.  We each put one of these roots in our pocket, intending to use\r\nthem for our supper--of which more hereafter.  We also saw many\r\nbeautiful birds here, and traces of some four-footed animal again.\r\nMeanwhile the sun began to descend; so we returned to the shore and\r\npushed on, round the spouting rocks, into the next valley.  This was\r\nthat valley of which I have spoken as running across the entire island.\r\nIt was by far the largest and most beautiful that we had yet looked\r\nupon.  Here were trees of every shape and size and hue which it is\r\npossible to conceive of, many of which we had not seen in the other\r\nvalleys; for, the stream in this valley being larger, and the mould much\r\nricher than in the Valley of the Wreck, it was clothed with a more\r\nluxuriant growth of trees and plants.  Some trees were dark, glossy\r\ngreen; others of a rich and warm hue, contrasting well with those of a\r\npale, light green, which were everywhere abundant.  Among these we\r\nrecognised the broad, dark heads of the bread-fruit, with its golden\r\nfruit; the pure, silvery foliage of the candle-nut, and several species\r\nwhich bore a strong resemblance to the pine; while here and there, in\r\ngroups and in single trees, rose the tall forms of the cocoa-nut palms,\r\nspreading abroad, and waving their graceful plumes high above all the\r\nrest, as if they were a superior race of stately giants keeping guard\r\nover these luxuriant forests.  Oh, it was a most enchanting scene! and I\r\nthanked God for having created such delightful spots for the use of man.\r\n\r\nNow, while we were gazing around us in silent admiration, Jack uttered\r\nan exclamation of surprise, and pointing to an object a little to one\r\nside of us, said:\r\n\r\n\"That's a banyan tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what's a banyan tree?\" inquired Peterkin as we walked towards it.\r\n\r\n\"A very curious one, as you shall see presently,\" replied Jack.  \"It is\r\ncalled the _aoa_ here, if I recollect rightly, and has a wonderful\r\npeculiarity about it.  What an enormous one it is, to be sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"_It_!\" repeated Peterkin.  \"Why, there are dozens of banyans here!\r\nWhat do you mean by talking bad grammar?  Is your philosophy deserting\r\nyou, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is but one tree here of this kind,\" returned Jack, \"as you will\r\nperceive if you will examine it.\"  And, sure enough, we did find that\r\nwhat we had supposed was a forest of trees was in reality only one.  Its\r\nbark was of a light colour, and had a shining appearance, the leaves\r\nbeing lance-shaped, small, and of a beautiful pea-green.  But the\r\nwonderful thing about it was that the branches, which grew out from the\r\nstem horizontally, sent down long shoots or fibres to the ground, which,\r\ntaking root, had themselves become trees, and were covered with bark\r\nlike the tree itself.  Many of these fibres had descended from the\r\nbranches at various distances, and thus supported them on natural\r\npillars, some of which were so large and strong that it was not easy at\r\nfirst to distinguish the offspring from the parent stem.  The fibres\r\nwere of all sizes and in all states of advancement, from the pillars we\r\nhave just mentioned to small cords which hung down and were about to\r\ntake root, and thin brown threads still far from the ground, which\r\nswayed about with every motion of wind.  In short, it seemed to us that,\r\nif there were only space afforded to it, this single tree would at\r\nlength cover the whole island.\r\n\r\nShortly after this we came upon another remarkable tree, which, as its\r\npeculiar formation afterwards proved extremely useful to us, merits\r\ndescription.  It was a splendid chestnut, but its proper name Jack did\r\nnot know.  However, there were quantities of fine nuts upon it, some of\r\nwhich we put in our pockets.  But its stem was the most wonderful part\r\nof it.  It rose to about twelve feet without a branch, and was not of\r\ngreat thickness; on the contrary, it was remarkably slender for the size\r\nof the tree.  But to make up for this, there were four or five wonderful\r\nprojections in this stem, which I cannot better describe than by asking\r\nthe reader to suppose that five planks of two inches thick and three\r\nfeet broad had been placed round the trunk of the tree, with their\r\n_edges_ closely fixed to it, from the ground up to the branches, and\r\nthat these planks had been covered over with the bark of the tree and\r\nincorporated with it.  In short, they were just natural buttresses,\r\nwithout which the stem could not have supported its heavy and umbrageous\r\ntop.  We found these chestnuts to be very numerous.  They grew chiefly\r\non the banks of the stream, and were of all sizes.\r\n\r\nWhile we were examining a small tree of this kind Jack chipped a piece\r\noff a buttress with his axe, and found the wood to be firm and easily\r\ncut.  He then struck the axe into it with all his force, and very soon\r\nsplit it off close to the tree--first, however, having cut it across\r\ntransversely above and below.  By this means he satisfied himself that\r\nwe could now obtain short planks, as it were all ready sawn, of any size\r\nand thickness that we desired, which was a very great discovery indeed--\r\nperhaps the most important we had yet made.\r\n\r\nWe now wended our way back to the coast, intending to encamp near the\r\nbeach, as we found that the mosquitoes were troublesome in the forest.\r\nOn our way we could not help admiring the birds which flew and chirped\r\naround us.  Among them we observed a pretty kind of paroquet, with a\r\ngreen body, a blue head, and a red breast; also a few beautiful\r\nturtle-doves, and several flocks of wood-pigeons.  The hues of many of\r\nthese birds were extremely vivid--bright green, blue, and scarlet being\r\nthe prevailing tints.  We made several attempts throughout the day to\r\nbring down one of these, both with the bow and the sling--not for mere\r\nsport, but to ascertain whether they were good for food.  But we\r\ninvariably missed, although once or twice we were very near hitting.  As\r\nevening drew on however, a flock of pigeons flew past.  I slung a stone\r\ninto the midst of them at a venture, and had the good fortune to kill\r\none.  We were startled soon after by a loud whistling noise above our\r\nheads, and on looking up, saw a flock of wild ducks making for the\r\ncoast.  We watched these, and observing where they alighted, followed\r\nthem up until we came upon a most lovely blue lake, not more than two\r\nhundred yards long, embosomed in verdant trees.  Its placid surface,\r\nwhich reflected every leaf and stem as if in a mirror, was covered with\r\nvarious species of wild ducks, feeding among the sedges and broad-leaved\r\nwater-plants which floated on it, while numerous birds like water-hens\r\nran to and fro most busily on its margin.  These all, with one accord,\r\nflew tumultuously away the instant we made our appearance.  While\r\nwalking along the margin we observed fish in the water, but of what sort\r\nwe could not tell.\r\n\r\nNow, as we neared the shore, Jack and I said we would go a little out of\r\nour way to see if we could procure one of those ducks; so, directing\r\nPeterkin to go straight to the shore and kindle a fire, we separated,\r\npromising to rejoin him speedily.  But we did not find the ducks,\r\nalthough we made a diligent search for half-an-hour.  We were about to\r\nretrace our steps when we were arrested by one of the strangest sights\r\nthat we had yet beheld.\r\n\r\nJust in front of us, at the distance of about ten yards, grew a superb\r\ntree, which certainly was the largest we had yet seen on the island.\r\nIts trunk was at least five feet in diameter, with a smooth, grey bark;\r\nabove this the spreading branches were clothed with light-green leaves,\r\namid which were clusters of bright-yellow fruit, so numerous as to weigh\r\ndown the boughs with their great weight.  This fruit seemed to be of the\r\nplum species, of an oblong form, and a good deal larger than the magnum\r\nbonum plum.  The ground at the foot of this tree was thickly strewn with\r\nthe fallen fruit, in the midst of which lay sleeping, in every possible\r\nattitude, at least twenty hogs of all ages and sizes, apparently quite\r\nsurfeited with a recent banquet.\r\n\r\nJack and I could scarce restrain our laughter as we gazed at these\r\ncoarse, fat, ill-looking animals while they lay groaning and snoring\r\nheavily amid the remains of their supper.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ralph,\" said Jack in a low whisper, \"put a stone in your sling--a\r\ngood big one--and let fly at that fat fellow with his back toward you.\r\nI'll try to put an arrow into yon little pig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think we had better put them up first?\"  I whispered.  \"It\r\nseems cruel to kill them while asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I wanted _sport_, Ralph, I would certainly set them up; but as we\r\nonly want _pork_, we'll let them lie.  Besides, we're not sure of\r\nkilling them; so, fire away.\"\r\n\r\nThus admonished, I slung my stone with so good aim that it went bang\r\nagainst the hog's flank as if against the head of a drum; but it had no\r\nother effect than that of causing the animal to start to its feet, with\r\na frightful yell of surprise, and scamper away.  At the same instant\r\nJack's bow twanged, and the arrow pinned the little pig to the ground by\r\nthe ear.\r\n\r\n\"I've missed, after all!\" cried Jack, darting forward with uplifted axe;\r\nwhile the little pig uttered a loud squeal, tore the arrow from the\r\nground, and ran away with it, along with the whole drove, into the\r\nbushes and disappeared, though we heard them screaming long afterwards\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\n\"That's very provoking, now,\" said Jack, rubbing the point of his nose.\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" I replied, stroking my chin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we must make haste and rejoin Peterkin,\" said Jack; \"it's getting\r\nlate.\"  And without further remark, we threaded our way quickly through\r\nthe woods towards the shore.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached it we found wood laid out, the fire lighted and\r\nbeginning to kindle up, with other signs of preparation for our\r\nencampment; but Peterkin was nowhere to be found.  We wondered very much\r\nat this; but Jack suggested that he might have gone to fetch water, so\r\nhe gave a shout to let him know that we had arrived, and sat down upon a\r\nrock, while I threw off my jacket and seized the axe, intending to split\r\nup one or two billets of wood.  But I had scarce moved from the spot\r\nwhen, in the distance, we heard a most appalling shriek, which was\r\nfollowed up by a chorus of yells from the hogs, and a loud hurrah.\r\n\r\n\"I do believe,\" said I, \"that Peterkin has met with the hogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"When Greek meets Greek,\" said Jack, soliloquising, \"then comes the tug\r\nof--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Peterkin in the distance.\r\n\r\nWe turned hastily towards the direction whence the sound came, and soon\r\ndescried Peterkin walking along the beach towards us with a little pig\r\ntransfixed on the end of his long spear!\r\n\r\n\"Well done, my boy!\" exclaimed Jack, slapping him on the shoulder when\r\nhe came up.  \"You're the best shot amongst us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Jack!\" cried Peterkin as he disengaged the animal from his\r\nspear.  \"Do you recognise that hole?\" said he, pointing to the pig's\r\near; \"and are you familiar with this arrow, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare!\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you do,\" interrupted Peterkin; \"but, pray, restrain your\r\ndeclarations at this time, and let's have supper--for I'm uncommonly\r\nhungry, I can tell you.  And it's no joke to charge a whole herd of\r\nswine with their great-grandmother bristling like a giant porcupine, at\r\nthe head of them!\"\r\n\r\nWe now set about preparing supper; and, truly, a good display of viands\r\nwe made when all was laid out on a flat rock in the light of the blazing\r\nfire.  There was, first of all, the little pig; then there were the\r\ntaro-root, and the yam, and the potato, and six plums; and lastly, the\r\nwood-pigeon.  To these Peterkin added a bit of sugar-cane, which he had\r\ncut from a little patch of that plant which he had found not long after\r\nseparating from us; \"and,\" said he, \"the patch was somewhat in a square\r\nform, which convinces me it must have been planted by man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" replied Jack.  \"From all we have seen, I'm inclined to\r\nthink that some of the savages must have dwelt here long ago.\"\r\n\r\nWe found no small difficulty in making up our minds how we were to cook\r\nthe pig.  None of us had ever cut up one before, and we did not know\r\nexactly how to begin; besides, we had nothing but the axe to do it with,\r\nour knife having been forgotten.  At last Jack started up and said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't let us waste more time talking about it, boys.--Hold it up,\r\nPeterkin.  There, lay the hind leg on this block of wood--so;\" and he\r\ncut it off; with a large portion of the haunch, at a single blow of the\r\naxe.  \"Now the other--that's it.\"  And having thus cut off the two hind\r\nlegs, he made several deep gashes in them, thrust a sharp-pointed stick\r\nthrough each, and stuck them up before the blaze to roast.  The\r\nwood-pigeon was then split open, quite flat, washed clean in salt water,\r\nand treated in a similar manner.  While these were cooking we scraped a\r\nhole in the sand and ashes under the fire, into which we put our\r\nvegetables and covered them up.\r\n\r\nThe taro-root was of an oval shape, about ten inches long and four or\r\nfive thick.  It was of a mottled-grey colour, and had a thick rind.  We\r\nfound it somewhat like an Irish potato, and exceedingly good.  The yam\r\nwas roundish, and had a rough brown skin.  It was very sweet and well\r\nflavoured.  The potato, we were surprised to find, was quite sweet and\r\nexceedingly palatable, as also were the plums--and, indeed, the pork and\r\npigeon too--when we came to taste them.  Altogether, this was decidedly\r\nthe most luxurious supper we had enjoyed for many a day.  Jack said it\r\nwas out-of-sight better than we ever got on board ship; and Peterkin\r\nsaid he feared that if we should remain long on the island he would\r\ninfallibly become a glutton or an epicure, whereat Jack remarked that he\r\nneed not fear that, for he was both already!  And so, having eaten our\r\nfill, not forgetting to finish off with a plum, we laid ourselves\r\ncomfortably down to sleep, upon a couch of branches, under the\r\noverhanging ledge of a coral rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF OVEREATING, AND REFLECTIONS THEREON--HUMBLE ADVICE REGARDING\r\nCOLD WATER--THE \"HORRIBLE CRY\" ACCOUNTED FOR--THE CURIOUS BIRDS CALLED\r\nPENGUINS--PECULIARITY OF THE COCOA-NUT PALM--QUESTIONS ON THE FORMATION\r\nOF CORAL ISLANDS--MYSTERIOUS FOOTSTEPS--STRANGE DISCOVERIES AND SAD\r\nSIGHTS.\r\n\r\nWhen we awoke on the following morning we found that the sun was already\r\na good way above the horizon, so I came to the conclusion that a heavy\r\nsupper is not conducive to early rising.  Never-the-less, we felt\r\nremarkably strong and well, and much disposed to have our breakfast.\r\nFirst, however, we had our customary morning bathe, which refreshed us\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered very much in after years that the inhabitants of\r\nmy own dear land did not make more frequent use of this most charming\r\nelement, water--I mean in the way of cold bathing.  Of course, I have\r\nperceived that it is not convenient for them to go into the sea or the\r\nrivers in winter, as we used to do on the Coral Island; but then I knew\r\nfrom experience that a large washing-tub and a sponge do form a most\r\npleasant substitute.  The feelings of freshness, of cleanliness, of\r\nvigour, and extreme hilarity that always followed my bathes in the sea--\r\nand even, when in England, my ablutions in the wash-tub--were so\r\ndelightful that I would sooner have gone without my breakfast than\r\nwithout my bathe in cold water.  My readers will forgive me for asking\r\nwhether they are in the habit of bathing thus every morning; and if they\r\nanswer \"No\", they will pardon me for recommending them to begin at once.\r\nOf late years, since retiring from the stirring life of adventure which\r\nI have led so long in foreign climes, I have heard of a system called\r\nthe cold-water cure.  Now, I do not know much about that system; so I do\r\nnot mean to uphold it, neither do I intend to run it down.  Perhaps, in\r\nreference to it, I may just hint that there may be too much of a good\r\nthing--I know not.  But of this I am quite certain, that there may also\r\nbe too little of a good thing; and the great delight I have had in cold\r\nbathing during the course of my adventurous career inclines me to think\r\nthat it is better to risk taking too much than to content one's self\r\nwith too little.  Such is my opinion, derived from much experience; but\r\nI put it before my readers with the utmost diffidence and with profound\r\nmodesty, knowing that it may possibly jar with their feelings of\r\nconfidence in their own ability to know and judge as to what is best and\r\nfittest in reference to their own affairs.  But to return from this\r\ndigression, for which I humbly crave forgiveness.\r\n\r\nWe had not advanced on our journey much above a mile or so, and were\r\njust beginning to feel the pleasant glow that usually accompanies\r\nvigorous exercise, when, on turning a point that revealed to us a new\r\nand beautiful cluster of islands, we were suddenly arrested by the\r\nappalling cry which had so alarmed us a few nights before.  But this\r\ntime we were by no means so much alarmed as on the previous occasion,\r\nbecause, whereas at that time it was night, now it was day; and I have\r\nalways found, though I am unable to account for it, that daylight\r\nbanishes many of the fears that are apt to assail us in the dark.\r\n\r\nOn hearing the sound, Peterkin instantly threw forward his spear.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what can it be?\" said he, looking round at Jack.  \"I tell you what\r\nit is: if we are to go on being pulled up in a constant state of horror\r\nand astonishment, as we have been for the last week, the sooner we're\r\nout o' this island the better, notwithstanding the yams and lemonade,\r\nand pork and plums!\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin's remark was followed by a repetition of the cry, louder than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"It comes from one of these islands,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It must be the ghost of a jackass, then,\" said Peterkin, \"for I never\r\nheard anything so like.\"\r\n\r\nWe all turned our eyes towards the cluster of islands, where, on the\r\nlargest, we observed curious objects moving on the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers they are--that's flat!\" cried Peterkin, gazing at them in the\r\nutmost amazement.\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, Peterkin's remark seemed to me to be correct; for at the\r\ndistance from which we saw them, they appeared to be an army of\r\nsoldiers.  There they stood, rank and file, in lines and in squares,\r\nmarching and counter-marching, with blue coats and white trousers.\r\nWhile we were looking at them the dreadful cry came again over the\r\nwater, and Peterkin suggested that it must be a regiment sent out to\r\nmassacre the natives in cold blood.  At this remark Jack laughed and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Peterkin, they are penguins!\"\r\n\r\n\"Penguins?\" repeated Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, penguins, Peterkin, penguins--nothing more or less than big\r\nsea-birds, as you shall see one of these days when we pay them a visit\r\nin our boat, which I mean to set about building the moment we return to\r\nour bower.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, then, our dreadful yelling ghosts and our murdering army of\r\nsoldiers,\" remarked Peterkin, \"have dwindled down to penguins--big\r\nsea-birds!  Very good.  Then I propose that we continue our journey as\r\nfast as possible, lest our island should be converted into a dream\r\nbefore we get completely round it.\"\r\n\r\nNow, as we continued on our way, I pondered much over this new discovery\r\nand the singular appearance of these birds, of which Jack could only\r\ngive us a very slight and vague account; and I began to long to commence\r\nour boat, in order that we might go and inspect them more narrowly.  But\r\nby degrees these thoughts left me, and I began to be much taken up again\r\nwith the interesting peculiarities of the country which we were passing\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThe second night we passed in a manner somewhat similar to the first--at\r\nabout two-thirds of the way round the island, as we calculated--and we\r\nhoped to sleep on the night following at our bower.  I will not here\r\nnote so particularly all that we said and saw during the course of this\r\nsecond day, as we did not make any further discoveries of great\r\nimportance.  The shore along which we travelled, and the various parts\r\nof the woods through which we passed, were similar to those which have\r\nbeen already treated of.  There were one or two observations that we\r\nmade, however, and these were as follows:\r\n\r\nWe saw that, while many of the large fruit-bearing trees grew only in\r\nthe valleys, and some of them only near the banks of the streams, where\r\nthe soil was peculiarly rich, the cocoa-nut palm grew in every place\r\nwhatsoever--not only on the hillsides, but also on the seashore, and\r\neven, as has been already stated, on the coral reef itself, where the\r\nsoil, if we may use the name, was nothing better than loose sand mingled\r\nwith broken shells and coral rock.  So near to the sea, too, did this\r\nuseful tree grow, that in many places its roots were washed by the spray\r\nfrom the breakers.  Yet we found the trees growing thus on the sands to\r\nbe quite as luxuriant as those growing in the valleys, and the fruit as\r\ngood and refreshing also.  Besides this, I noticed that on the summit of\r\nthe high mountain, which we once more ascended at a different point from\r\nour first ascent, were found abundance of shells and broken coral\r\nformations, which, Jack and I agreed, proved either that this island\r\nmust have once been under the sea, or that the sea must once have been\r\nabove the island: in other words, that as shells and coral could not\r\npossibly climb to the mountain-top, they must have been washed upon it\r\nwhile the mountain-top was on a level with the sea.  We pondered this\r\nvery much; and we put to ourselves the question, \"What raised the island\r\nto its present height above the sea?\"  But to this we could by no means\r\ngive to ourselves a satisfactory reply.  Jack thought it might have been\r\nblown up by a volcano; and Peterkin said he thought it must have jumped\r\nup of its own accord!  We also noticed, what had escaped us before, that\r\nthe solid rocks of which the island was formed were quite different from\r\nthe live coral rocks on the shore, where, the wonderful little insects\r\nwere continually working.  They seemed, indeed, to be of the same\r\nmaterial--a substance like limestone; but while the coral rocks were\r\nquite full of minute cells in which the insects lived, the other rocks\r\ninland were hard and solid, without the appearance of cells at all.  Our\r\nthoughts and conversations on this subject were sometimes so profound\r\nthat Peterkin said we should certainly get drowned in them at last, even\r\nalthough we were such good divers!  Nevertheless, we did not allow his\r\npleasantry on this and similar points to deter us from making our notes\r\nand observations as we went along.\r\n\r\nWe found several more droves of hogs in the woods, but abstained from\r\nkilling any of them, having more than sufficient for our present\r\nnecessities.  We saw, also, many of their footprints in this\r\nneighbourhood.  Among these we also observed the footprints of a smaller\r\nanimal, which we examined with much care, but could form no certain\r\nopinion as to them.  Peterkin thought they were those of a little dog,\r\nbut Jack and I thought differently.  We became very curious on this\r\nmatter, the more so that we observed these footprints to lie scattered\r\nabout in one locality, as if the animal which had made them was\r\nwandering round about in a very irregular manner and without any object\r\nin view.  Early in the forenoon of our third day we observed these\r\nfootprints to be much more numerous than ever, and in one particular\r\nspot they diverged off into the woods in a regular beaten track, which\r\nwas, however, so closely beset with bushes that we pushed through it\r\nwith difficulty.  We had now become so anxious to find out what animal\r\nthis was, and where it went to, that we determined to follow the track\r\nand, if possible, clear up the mystery.  Peterkin said, in a bantering\r\ntone, that he was sure it would be cleared up, as usual, in some\r\nfrightfully simple way, and prove to be no mystery at all!\r\n\r\nThe beaten track seemed much too large to have been formed by the animal\r\nitself, and we concluded that some larger animal had made it, and that\r\nthe smaller one made use of it.  But everywhere the creeping plants and\r\ntangled bushes crossed our path, so that we forced our way along with\r\nsome difficulty.  Suddenly, as we came upon an open space, we heard a\r\nfaint cry, and observed a black animal standing in the track before us.\r\n\r\n\"A wild cat!\" cried Jack, fitting an arrow to his bow, and discharging\r\nit so hastily that he missed the animal, and hit the earth about\r\nhalf-a-foot to one side of it.  To our surprise, the wild cat did not\r\nfly, but walked slowly towards the arrow and snuffed at it.\r\n\r\n\"That's the most comical wild cat I ever saw!\" cried Jack.\r\n\r\n\"It's a tame wild cat, I think,\" said Peterkin, levelling his spear to\r\nmake a charge.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried I, laying my hand on his shoulder.  \"I do believe the poor\r\nbeast is blind.  See, it strikes against the branches as it walks along.\r\nIt must be a very old one;\" and I hastened towards it.\r\n\r\n\"Only think,\" said Peterkin with a suppressed laugh, \"of a superannuated\r\nwild cat!\"\r\n\r\nWe now found that the poor cat was not only blind, or nearly so, but\r\nextremely deaf, as it did not hear our footsteps until we were quite\r\nclose behind it.  Then it sprang round, and, putting up its back and\r\ntail, while the black hair stood all on end, uttered a hoarse mew and a\r\nfuff.\r\n\r\nPoor thing said Peterkin, gently extending his hand and endeavouring to\r\npat the cat's head.  \"Poor pussy! chee, chee, chee! puss, puss, puss!\r\ncheetie pussy!\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the cat hear these sounds than all signs of anger fled,\r\nand advancing eagerly to Peterkin, it allowed itself to be stroked, and\r\nrubbed itself against his legs, purring loudly all the time, and showing\r\nevery symptom of the most extreme delight.\r\n\r\n\"It's no more a wild cat than I am!\" cried Peterkin, taking it in his\r\narms; \"it's quite tame.--Poor pussy! cheetie pussy!\"\r\n\r\nWe now crowded around Peterkin, and were not a little surprised--and, to\r\nsay truth, a good deal affected--by the sight of the poor animal's\r\nexcessive joy.  It rubbed its head against Peterkin's cheek, licked his\r\nchin, and thrust its head almost violently into his neck, while it\r\npurred more loudly than I ever heard a cat purr before, and appeared to\r\nbe so much overpowered by its feelings that it occasionally mewed and\r\npurred almost in the same breath.  Such demonstrations of joy and\r\naffection led us at once to conclude that this poor cat must have known\r\nman before, and we conjectured that it had been left either accidentally\r\nor by design on the island many years ago, and was now evincing its\r\nextreme joy at meeting once more with human beings.  While we were\r\nfondling the cat and talking about it, Jack glanced round the open space\r\nin the midst of which we stood.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" exclaimed he; \"this looks something like a clearing.  The axe\r\nhas been at work here.  Just look at these tree-stumps.\"\r\n\r\nWe now turned to examine these, and without doubt we found trees that\r\nhad been cut down here and there, also stumps and broken branches--all\r\nof which, however, were completely covered over with moss, and bore\r\nevidence of having been in this condition for some years.  No human\r\nfootprints were to be seen either on the track or among the bushes, but\r\nthose of the cat were found everywhere.  We now determined to follow up\r\nthe track as far as it went, and Peterkin put the cat down; but it\r\nseemed to be so weak, and mewed so very pitifully, that he took it up\r\nagain and carried it in his arms, where in a few minutes it fell sound\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nAbout ten yards farther on, the felled trees became more numerous, and\r\nthe track, diverging to the right, followed for a short space the banks\r\nof a stream.  Suddenly we came to a spot where once must have been a\r\nrude bridge, the stones of which were scattered in the stream, and those\r\non each bank entirely covered over with moss.  In silent surprise and\r\nexpectancy we continued to advance, and a few yards farther on, beheld,\r\nunder the shelter of some bread-fruit trees, a small hut or cottage.  I\r\ncannot hope to convey to my readers a very correct idea of the feelings\r\nthat affected us on witnessing this unexpected sight.  We stood for a\r\nlong time in silent wonder, for there was a deep and most melancholy\r\nstillness about the place that quite overpowered us; and when we did at\r\nlength speak, it was in subdued whispers, as if we were surrounded by\r\nsome awful or supernatural influence.  Even Peterkin's voice, usually so\r\nquick and lively on all occasions, was hushed now; for there was a\r\ndreariness about this silent, lonely, uninhabited cottage--so strange in\r\nits appearance, so far away from the usual dwellings of man, so old,\r\ndecayed, and deserted in its aspect that fell upon our spirits like a\r\nthick cloud, and blotted out as with a pall the cheerful sunshine that\r\nhad filled us since the commencement of our tour round the island.\r\n\r\nThe hut or cottage was rude and simple in its construction.  It was not\r\nmore than twelve feet long by ten feet broad, and about seven or eight\r\nfeet high.  It had one window, or rather a small frame in which a window\r\nmight perhaps once have been, but which was now empty.  The door was\r\nexceedingly low, and formed of rough boards, and the roof was covered\r\nwith broad cocoa-nut and plantain leaves.  But every part of it was in a\r\nstate of the utmost decay.  Moss and green matter grew in spots all over\r\nit.  The woodwork was quite perforated with holes; the roof had nearly\r\nfallen in, and appeared to be prevented from doing so altogether by the\r\nthick matting of creeping plants and the interlaced branches which years\r\nof neglect had allowed to cover it almost entirely; while the thick,\r\nluxuriant branches of the bread-fruit and other trees spread above it,\r\nand flung a deep, sombre shadow over the spot, as if to guard it from\r\nthe heat and the light of day.  We conversed long and in whispers about\r\nthis strange habitation ere we ventured to approach it; and when at\r\nlength we did so, it was, at least on my part, with feelings of awe.\r\n\r\nAt first Jack endeavoured to peep in at the window; but from the deep\r\nshadow of the trees already mentioned, and the gloom within, he could\r\nnot clearly discern objects, so we lifted the latch and pushed open the\r\ndoor.  We observed that the latch was made of iron, and almost eaten\r\naway with rust.  In the like condition were also the hinges, which\r\ncreaked as the door swung back.  On entering, we stood still and gazed\r\naround us, while we were much impressed with the dreary stillness of the\r\nroom.  But what we saw there surprised and shocked us not a little.\r\nThere was no furniture in the apartment save a little wooden stool and\r\nan iron pot, the latter almost eaten through with rust.  In the corner\r\nfarthest from the door was a low bedstead, on which lay two skeletons,\r\nembedded in a little heap of dry dust.  With beating hearts we went\r\nforward to examine them.  One was the skeleton of a man; the other that\r\nof a dog, which was extended close beside that of the man, with its head\r\nresting on his bosom.\r\n\r\nNow we were very much concerned about this discovery, and could scarce\r\nrefrain from tears on beholding these sad remains.  After some time we\r\nbegan to talk about what we had seen, and to examine in and around the\r\nhut, in order to discover some clue to the name or history of this poor\r\nman, who had thus died in solitude, with none to mourn his loss save his\r\ncat and his faithful dog.  But we found nothing--neither a book nor a\r\nscrap of paper.  We found, however, the decayed remnants of what\r\nappeared to have been clothing, and an old axe.  But none of these\r\nthings bore marks of any kind, and indeed they were so much decayed as\r\nto convince us that they had lain in the condition in which we found\r\nthem for many years.\r\n\r\nThis discovery now accounted to us for the tree-stump at the top of the\r\nmountain with the initials cut on it; also for the patch of sugar-cane\r\nand other traces of man which we had met with in the course of our\r\nrambles over the island.  And we were much saddened by the reflection\r\nthat the lot of this poor wanderer might possibly be our own, after many\r\nyears' residence on the island, unless we should be rescued by the visit\r\nof some vessel or the arrival of natives.  Having no clue whatever to\r\naccount for the presence of this poor human being in such a lonely spot,\r\nwe fell to conjecturing what could have brought him there.  I was\r\ninclined to think that he must have been a shipwrecked sailor, whose\r\nvessel had been lost here, and all the crew been drowned except himself\r\nand his dog and cat.  But Jack thought it more likely that he had run\r\naway from his vessel, and had taken the dog and cat to keep him company.\r\nWe were also much occupied in our minds with the wonderful difference\r\nbetween the cat and the dog.  For here we saw that while the one\r\nperished like a loving friend by its master's side, with its head\r\nresting on his bosom, the other had sought to sustain itself by prowling\r\nabroad in the forest, and had lived in solitude to a good old age.\r\nHowever, we did not conclude from this that the cat was destitute of\r\naffection, for we could not forget its emotions on first meeting with\r\nus; but we saw from this that the dog had a great deal more of generous\r\nlove in its nature than the cat, because it not only found it impossible\r\nto live after the death of its master, but it must needs, when it came\r\nto die, crawl to his side and rest its head upon his lifeless breast.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thinking on these things, and examining into everything\r\nabout the room, we were attracted by an exclamation from Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Jack,\" said he, \"here is something that will be of use to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Jack, hastening across the room.\r\n\r\n\"An old pistol,\" replied Peterkin, holding up the weapon, which he had\r\njust pulled from under a heap of broken wood and rubbish that lay in a\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\"That, indeed, might have been useful,\" said Jack, examining it, \"if we\r\nhad any powder; but I suspect the bow and the sling will prove more\r\nserviceable.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, I forgot that,\" said Peterkin; \"but we may as well take it with\r\nus, for the flint will serve to strike fire with when the sun does not\r\nshine.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having spent more than an hour at this place without discovering\r\nanything of further interest, Peterkin took up the old cat, which had\r\nlain very contentedly asleep on the stool whereon he had placed it, and\r\nwe prepared to take our departure.  In leaving the hut, Jack stumbled\r\nheavily against the door-post, which was so much decayed as to break\r\nacross, and the whole fabric of the hut seemed ready to tumble about our\r\nears.  This put it into our heads that we might as well pull it down,\r\nand so form a mound over the skeleton.  Jack, therefore, with his axe,\r\ncut down the other door-post, which, when it was done, brought the whole\r\nhut in ruins to the ground, and thus formed a grave to the bones of the\r\npoor recluse and his dog.  Then we left the spot, having brought away\r\nthe iron pot, the pistol, and the old axe, as they might be of much use\r\nto us hereafter.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of this day we pursued our journey, and examined the\r\nother end of the large valley, which we found to be so much alike to the\r\nparts already described that I shall not recount the particulars of what\r\nwe saw in this place.  I may, however, remark that we did not quite\r\nrecover our former cheerful spirits until we arrived at our bower, which\r\nwe did late in the evening, and found everything just in the same\r\ncondition as we had left it three days before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nSOMETHING WRONG WITH THE TANK--JACK'S WISDOM AND PETERKIN'S\r\nIMPERTINENCE--WONDERFUL BEHAVIOUR OF A CRAB--GOOD WISHES FOR THOSE WHO\r\nDWELL FAR FROM THE SEA--JACK COMMENCES TO BUILD A LITTLE BOAT.\r\n\r\nRest is sweet, as well for the body as for the mind.  During my long\r\nexperience, amid the vicissitudes of a chequered life, I have found that\r\nperiods of profound rest at certain intervals, in addition to the\r\nordinary hours of repose, are necessary to the well-being of man.  And\r\nthe nature, as well as the period, of this rest varies according to the\r\ndifferent temperaments of individuals and the peculiar circumstances in\r\nwhich they may chance to be placed.  To those who work with their minds,\r\nbodily labour is rest; to those who labour with the body, deep sleep is\r\nrest; to the downcast, the weary, and the sorrowful, joy and peace are\r\nrest.  Nay, further, I think that to the gay, the frivolous, the\r\nreckless, when sated with pleasures that cannot last, even sorrow proves\r\nto be rest of a kind, although, perchance, it were better that I should\r\ncall it relief than rest.  There is, indeed, but one class of men to\r\nwhom rest is denied--there is no rest to the wicked.  At this I do but\r\nhint, however, as I treat not of that rest which is spiritual, but more\r\nparticularly of that which applies to the mind and to the body.\r\n\r\nOf this rest we stood much in need on our return home, and we found it\r\nexceedingly sweet when we indulged in it after completing the journey\r\njust related.  It had not, indeed, been a very long journey;\r\nnevertheless, we had pursued it so diligently that our frames were not a\r\nlittle prostrated.  Our minds were also very much exhausted in\r\nconsequence of the many surprises, frequent alarms, and much profound\r\nthought to which they had been subjected; so that when we lay down, on\r\nthe night of our return, under the shelter of the bower, we fell\r\nimmediately into very deep repose.  I can state this with much\r\ncertainty; for Jack afterwards admitted the fact, and Peterkin, although\r\nhe stoutly denied it, I heard snoring loudly at least two minutes after\r\nlying down.  In this condition we remained all night and the whole of\r\nthe following day without awaking once, or so much as moving our\r\npositions.  When we did awake it was near sunset, and we were all in\r\nsuch a state of lassitude that we merely rose to swallow a mouthful of\r\nfood.  As Peterkin remarked, in the midst of a yawn, we took breakfast\r\nat tea-time, and then went to bed again, where we lay till the following\r\nforenoon.\r\n\r\nAfter this we arose very greatly refreshed, but much alarmed lest we had\r\nlost count of a day.  I say we were much alarmed on this head; for we\r\nhad carefully kept count of the days, since we were cast upon our\r\nisland, in order that we might remember the Sabbath-day, which day we\r\nhad hitherto, with one accord, kept as a day of rest, and refrained from\r\nall work whatsoever.  However, on considering the subject, we all three\r\nentertained the same opinion as to how long we had slept, and so our\r\nminds were put at ease.\r\n\r\nWe now hastened to our Water Garden to enjoy a bathe, and to see how did\r\nthe animals which I had placed in the tank.  We found the garden more\r\ncharming, pellucid, and inviting than ever; and Jack and I plunged into\r\nits depths and gambolled among its radiant coral groves, while Peterkin\r\nwallowed at the surface, and tried occasionally to kick us as we passed\r\nbelow.  Having dressed, I then hastened to the tank; but what was my\r\nsurprise and grief to find nearly all the animals dead, and the water in\r\na putrid condition!  I was greatly distressed at this, and wondered what\r\ncould be the cause of it.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you precious humbug!\" said Peterkin, coming up to me, \"how could\r\nyou expect it to be otherwise?  When fishes are accustomed to live in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, how can you expect them to exist in a hole like\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Peterkin,\" I replied, \"there seems to be truth in what you say.\r\nNevertheless, now I think of it, there must be some error in your\r\nreasoning; for if I put in but a few very small animals, they will bear\r\nthe same proportion to this pond that the millions of fish bear to the\r\nocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Jack!\" cried Peterkin, waving his hand; \"come here, like a good\r\nfellow.  Ralph is actually talking philosophy.  Do come to our\r\nassistance, for he's out o' sight beyond me already!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Jack, coming up, while he endeavoured to\r\nscrub his long hair dry with a towel of cocoa-nut cloth.\r\n\r\nI repeated my thoughts to Jack, who, I was happy to find, quite agreed\r\nwith me.  \"The best plan,\" he said, \"will be to put very few animals at\r\nfirst into your tank, and add more as you find it will bear them.  And\r\nlook here,\" he added, pointing to the sides of the tank, which, for the\r\nspace of two inches above the water-level, were encrusted with salt,\r\n\"you must carry your philosophy a little further, Ralph.  That water has\r\nevaporated so much that it is too salt for anything to live in.  You\r\nwill require to add _fresh_ water now and then, in order to keep it at\r\nthe same degree of saltness as the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, Jack; that never struck me before,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"And, now I think of it,\" continued Jack, \"it seems to me that the\r\nsurest way of arranging your tank so as to get it to keep pure and in\r\ngood condition will be to _imitate_ the ocean in it; in fact, make it a\r\nminiature Pacific.  I don't see how you can hope to succeed unless you\r\ndo that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most true,\" said I, pondering what my companion said.  \"But I fear that\r\nthat will be very difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" cried Jack, rolling his towel up into a ball and throwing\r\nit into the face of Peterkin, who had been grinning and winking at him\r\nduring the last five minutes--\"not at all.  Look here.  There is water\r\nof a certain saltness in the sea; well, fill your tank with sea-water,\r\nand keep it at that saltness by marking the height at which the water\r\nstands on the sides.  When it evaporates a little, pour in _fresh_ water\r\nfrom the brook till it comes up to the mark, and then it will be right,\r\nfor the salt does not evaporate with the water.  Then there's lots of\r\nseaweed in the sea; well, go and get one or two bits of seaweed and put\r\nthem into your tank.  Of course the weed must be alive, and growing to\r\nlittle stones; or you can chip a bit off the rocks with the weed\r\nsticking to it.  Then, if you like, you can throw a little sand and\r\ngravel into your tank, and the thing's complete.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, not quite,\" said Peterkin, who had been gravely attentive to this\r\noff-hand advice--\"not quite.  You must first make three little men to\r\ndive in it before it can be said to be perfect; and that would be rather\r\ndifficult, I fear, for two of them would require to be philosophers.\r\nBut hallo! what's this?--I say, Ralph, look here!  There's one o' your\r\ncrabs up to something uncommon.  It's performing the most remarkable\r\noperation for a crab I ever saw--taking off its coat, I do believe,\r\nbefore going to bed!\"\r\n\r\nWe hastily stooped over the tank, and certainly were not a little amused\r\nat the conduct of one of the crabs which still survived its companions.\r\nIt was one of the common small crabs, like to those that are found\r\nrunning about everywhere on the coast of England.  While we gazed at it\r\nwe observed its back to split away from the lower part of its body, and\r\nout of the gap thus formed came a soft lump which moved and writhed\r\nunceasingly.  This lump continued to increase in size until it appeared\r\nlike a bunch of crab's legs; and, indeed, such it proved in a very few\r\nminutes to be, for the points of the toes were at length extricated from\r\nthe hole in its back, the legs spread out, the body followed, and the\r\ncrab walked away quite entire, even to the points of its nipper-claws,\r\nleaving a perfectly entire shell behind it, so that, when we looked, it\r\nseemed as though there were two complete crabs instead of one.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" exclaimed Peterkin, drawing a long breath, \"I've _heard_ of a\r\nman jumping out of his skin and sitting down in his skeleton in order to\r\ncool himself, but I never expected to _see_ a crab do it!\"\r\n\r\nWe were, in truth, much amazed at this spectacle, and the more so when\r\nwe observed that the new crab was larger than the crab that it came out\r\nof.  It was also quite soft, but by next morning its skin had hardened\r\ninto a good shell.  We came thus to know that crabs grow in this way,\r\nand not by the growing of their shells, as we had always thought before\r\nwe saw this wonderful operation.\r\n\r\nNow I considered well the advice which Jack had given me about preparing\r\nmy tank, and the more I thought of it the more I came to regard it as\r\nvery sound and worthy of being acted on.  So I forthwith put his plan in\r\nexecution, and found it to answer excellently well--indeed, much beyond\r\nmy expectation; for I found that after a little experience had taught me\r\nthe proper proportion of seaweed and animals to put into a certain\r\namount of water, the tank needed no further attendance.  And, moreover,\r\nI did not require ever afterwards to renew or change the sea-water, but\r\nonly to add a very little fresh water from the brook, now and then, as\r\nthe other evaporated.  I therefore concluded that if I had been suddenly\r\nconveyed, along with my tank, into some region where there was no salt\r\nsea at all, my little sea and my sea-fish would have continued to thrive\r\nand to prosper notwithstanding.  This made me greatly to desire that\r\nthose people in the world who live far inland might know of my wonderful\r\ntank, and by having materials like to those of which it was made\r\nconveyed to them, thus be enabled to watch the habits of those most\r\nmysterious animals that reside in the sea, and examine with their own\r\neyes the wonders of the great deep.\r\n\r\nFor many days after this, while Peterkin and Jack were busily employed\r\nin building a little boat out of the curious natural planks of the\r\nchestnut-tree, I spent much of my time in examining with the\r\nburning-glass the marvellous operations that were constantly going on in\r\nmy tank.  Here I saw those anemones which cling, like little red,\r\nyellow, and green blobs of jelly, to the rocks, put forth, as it were, a\r\nmultitude of arms and wait till little fish or other small animalcules\r\nunwarily touched them, when they would instantly seize them, fold arm\r\nafter arm round their victims, and so engulf them in their stomachs.\r\nHere I saw the ceaseless working of those little coral insects whose\r\nefforts have encrusted the islands of the Pacific with vast rocks, and\r\nsurrounded them with enormous reefs; and I observed that many of these\r\ninsects, though extremely minute, were very beautiful, coming out of\r\ntheir holes in a circle of fine threads, and having the form of a\r\nshuttlecock.  Here I saw curious little barnacles opening a hole in\r\ntheir backs and constantly putting out a thin, feathery hand, with\r\nwhich, I doubt not, they dragged their food into their mouths.  Here,\r\nalso, I saw those crabs which have shells only on the front of their\r\nbodies, but no shell whatever on their remarkably tender tails, so that,\r\nin order to find a protection to them, they thrust them into the empty\r\nshells of whelks, or some such fish, and when they grow too big for one,\r\nchange into another.  But, most curious of all, I saw an animal which\r\nhad the wonderful power, when it became ill, of casting its stomach and\r\nits teeth away from it, and getting an entirely new set in the course of\r\na few months!  All this I saw, and a great deal more, by means of my\r\ntank and my burning-glass; but I refrain from setting down more\r\nparticulars here, as I have still much to tell of the adventures that\r\nbefell us while we remained on this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nNOTABLE DISCOVERY AT THE SPOUTING CLIFFS--THE MYSTERIOUS GREEN MONSTER\r\nEXPLAINED--WE ARE THROWN INTO UNUTTERABLE TERROR BY THE IDEA THAT JACK\r\nIS DROWNED--THE DIAMOND CAVE.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Jack,\" cried Peterkin one morning about three weeks after our\r\nreturn from our long excursion, \"let's be jolly to-day, and do something\r\nvigorous.  I'm quite tired of hammering and bammering, hewing and\r\nscrewing, cutting and butting at that little boat of ours, that seems as\r\nhard to build as Noah's ark.  Let us go on an excursion to the\r\nmountain-top, or have a hunt after the wild ducks, or make a dash at the\r\npigs.  I'm quite flat--flat as bad ginger-beer--flat as a pancake; in\r\nfact, I want something to rouse me--to toss me up, as it were.  Eh! what\r\ndo you say to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Jack, throwing down the axe with which he was just\r\nabout to proceed towards the boat, \"if that's what you want, I would\r\nrecommend you to make an excursion to the waterspouts.  The last one we\r\nhad to do with tossed you up a considerable height; perhaps the next\r\nwill send you higher--who knows?--if you're at all reasonable or\r\nmoderate in your expectations!\"\r\n\r\n\"Jack, my dear boy,\" said Peterkin gravely, \"you are really becoming too\r\nfond of jesting.  It's a thing I don't at all approve of; and if you\r\ndon't give it up, I fear that, for our mutual good, we shall have to\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Peterkin,\" replied Jack with a smile, \"what would you\r\nhave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have?\" said Peterkin.  \"I would _have_ nothing.  I didn't say I wanted\r\nto _have_; I said that I wanted to _do_.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the bye,\" said I, interrupting their conversation, \"I am reminded by\r\nthis that we have not yet discovered the nature of yon curious\r\nappearance that we saw near the waterspouts on our journey round the\r\nisland.  Perhaps it would be well to go for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Peterkin, \"I know the nature of it well enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"It was of a _mysterious_ nature, to be sure!\" said he with a wave of\r\nhis hand, while he rose from the log on which he had been sitting and\r\nbuckled on his belt, into which he thrust his enormous club.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, let us away to the waterspouts,\" cried Jack, going up to\r\nthe bower for his bow and arrows.--\"And bring your spear, Peterkin; it\r\nmay be useful.\"\r\n\r\nWe now, having made up our minds to examine into this matter, sallied\r\nforth eagerly in the direction of the waterspout rocks, which, as I have\r\nbefore mentioned, were not far from our present place of abode.  On\r\narriving there we hastened down to the edge of the rocks and gazed over\r\ninto the sea, where we observed the pale-green object still distinctly\r\nvisible, moving its tail slowly to and fro in the water.\r\n\r\n\"Most remarkable!\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Exceedingly curious!\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Beats everything!\" said Peterkin.--\"Now, Jack,\" he added, \"you made\r\nsuch a poor figure in your last attempt to stick that object that I\r\nwould advise you to let me try it.  If it has got a heart at all, I'll\r\nengage to send my spear right through the core of it; if it hasn't got a\r\nheart, I'll send it through the spot where its heart ought to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire away, then, my boy,\" replied Jack with a laugh.\r\n\r\nPeterkin immediately took the spear, poised it for a second or two above\r\nhis head, then darted it like an arrow into the sea.  Down it went\r\nstraight into the centre of the green object, passed quite through it,\r\nand came up immediately afterwards, pure and unsullied, while the\r\nmysterious tail moved quietly as before!\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Peterkin gravely, \"that brute is a heartless monster; I'll\r\nhave nothing more to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm pretty sure now,\" said Jack, \"that it is merely a phosphoric light;\r\nbut I must say I'm puzzled at its staying always in that exact spot.\"\r\n\r\nI also was much puzzled, and inclined to think with Jack that it must be\r\nphosphoric light, of which luminous appearance we had seen much while on\r\nour voyage to these seas.  \"But,\" said I, \"there is nothing to hinder us\r\nfrom diving down to it, now that we are sure it is not a shark.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" returned Jack, stripping off his clothes.  \"I'll go down, Ralph,\r\nas I'm better at diving than you are.--Now, then, Peterkin, out o' the\r\nroad!\"  Jack stepped forward, joined his hands above his head, bent over\r\nthe rocks, and plunged into the sea.  For a second or two the spray\r\ncaused by his dive hid him from view; then the water became still, and\r\nwe saw him swimming far down in the midst of the green object.  Suddenly\r\nhe sank below it, and vanished altogether from our sight!  We gazed\r\nanxiously down at the spot where he had disappeared for nearly a minute,\r\nexpecting every moment to see him rise again for breath; but fully a\r\nminute passed and still he did not reappear.  Two minutes passed! and\r\nthen a flood of alarm rushed in upon my soul when I considered that,\r\nduring all my acquaintance with him, Jack had never stayed under water\r\nmore than a minute at a time--indeed, seldom so long.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Peterkin!\"  I said in a voice that trembled with increasing anxiety,\r\n\"something has happened.  It is more than three minutes now.\"  But\r\nPeterkin did not answer; and I observed that he was gazing down into the\r\nwater with a look of intense fear mingled with anxiety, while his face\r\nwas overspread with a deadly paleness.  Suddenly he sprang to his feet\r\nand rushed about in a frantic state, wringing his hands, and exclaiming,\r\n\"Oh Jack!  Jack!  He is gone!  It must have been a shark, and he is gone\r\nfor ever!\"\r\n\r\nFor the next five minutes I know not what I did; the intensity of my\r\nfeelings almost bereft me of my senses.  But I was recalled to myself by\r\nPeterkin seizing me by the shoulders and staring wildly into my face,\r\nwhile he exclaimed, \"Ralph!  Ralph! perhaps he has only fainted!  Dive\r\nfor him, Ralph!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed strange that this did not occur to me sooner.  In a moment I\r\nrushed to the edge of the rocks, and without waiting to throw off my\r\ngarments, was on the point to spring into the waves when I observed\r\nsomething black rising up through the green object.  In another moment\r\nJack's head rose to the surface, and he gave a wild shout, flinging back\r\nthe spray from his locks, as was his wont after a dive.  Now we were\r\nalmost as much amazed at seeing him reappear, well and strong, as we had\r\nbeen at first at his non-appearance; for, to the best of our judgment,\r\nhe had been nearly ten minutes under water--perhaps longer--and it\r\nrequired no exertion of our reason to convince us that this was utterly\r\nimpossible for mortal man to do and retain his strength and faculties.\r\nIt was, therefore, with a feeling akin to superstitious awe that I held\r\ndown my hand and assisted him to clamber up the steep rocks.  But no\r\nsuch feeling affected Peterkin.  No sooner did Jack gain the rocks and\r\nseat himself on one, panting for breath, than he threw his arms round\r\nhis neck and burst into a flood of tears.  \"Oh Jack!  Jack!\" said he,\r\n\"where were you?  What kept you so long?\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments Peterkin became composed enough to sit still and\r\nlisten to Jack's explanation, although he could not restrain himself\r\nfrom attempting to wink every two minutes at me in order to express his\r\njoy at Jack's safety.  I say he attempted to wink, but I am bound to add\r\nthat he did not succeed; for his eyes were so much swollen with weeping\r\nthat his frequent attempts only resulted in a series of violent and\r\naltogether idiotical contortions of the face, that were very far from\r\nexpressing what he intended.  However, I knew what the poor fellow meant\r\nby it; so I smiled to him in return, and endeavoured to make believe\r\nthat he was winking.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack when we were composed enough to listen to him,\r\n\"yon green object is not a shark; it is a stream of light issuing from a\r\ncave in the rocks.  Just after I made my dive, I observed that this\r\nlight came from the side of the rock above which we are now sitting; so\r\nI struck out for it, and saw an opening into some place or other that\r\nappeared to be luminous within.  For one instant I paused to think\r\nwhether I ought to venture.  Then I made up my mind and dashed into it;\r\nfor you see, Peterkin, although I take some time to tell this, it\r\nhappened in the space of a few seconds, so that I knew I had wind enough\r\nin me to serve to bring me out o' the hole and up to the surface again.\r\nWell, I was just on the point of turning--for I began to feel a little\r\nuncomfortable in such a place--when it seemed to me as if there was a\r\nfaint light right above me.  I darted upwards, and found my head out of\r\nwater.  This relieved me greatly, for I now felt that I could take in\r\nair enough to enable me to return the way I came.  Then it all at once\r\noccurred to me that I might not be able to find the way out again; but\r\non glancing downwards, my mind was put quite at rest by seeing the green\r\nlight below me streaming into the cave, just like the light that we had\r\nseen streaming out of it, only what I now saw was much brighter.\r\n\r\n\"At first I could scarcely see anything as I gazed around me, it was so\r\ndark; but gradually my eyes became accustomed to it, and I found that I\r\nwas in a huge cave, part of the walls of which I observed on each side\r\nof me.  The ceiling just above me was also visible, and I fancied that I\r\ncould perceive beautiful, glittering objects there; but the farther end\r\nof the cave was shrouded in darkness.  While I was looking around me in\r\ngreat wonder, it came into my head that you two would think I was\r\ndrowned; so I plunged down through the passage again in a great hurry,\r\nrose to the surface, and--here I am!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jack concluded his recital of what he had seen in this remarkable\r\ncave, I could not rest satisfied till I had dived down to see it; which\r\nI did, but found it so dark, as Jack had said, that I could scarcely see\r\nanything.  When I returned we had a long conversation about, it, during\r\nwhich I observed that Peterkin had a most lugubrious expression on his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Peterkin?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"The matter?\" he replied.  \"It's all very well for you two to be talking\r\naway like mermaids about the wonders of this cave; but you know I must\r\nbe content to hear about it, while you are enjoying yourselves down\r\nthere like mad dolphins.  It's really too bad!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry for you, Peterkin--indeed I am,\" said Jack; \"but we\r\ncannot help you.  If you would only learn to dive--\"\r\n\r\n\"Learn to fly, you might as well say!\" retorted Peterkin in a very sulky\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"If you would only consent to keep still,\" said I, \"we would take you\r\ndown with us in ten seconds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!\" returned Peterkin; \"suppose a salamander was to propose to you\r\n`only to keep still' and he would carry you through a blazing fire in a\r\nfew seconds, what would you say?\"\r\n\r\nWe both laughed and shook our heads, for it was evident that nothing was\r\nto be made of Peterkin in the water.  But we could not rest satisfied\r\ntill we had seen more of this cave; so, after further consultation, Jack\r\nand I determined to try if we could take down a torch with us, and set\r\nfire to it in the cavern.  This we found to be an undertaking of no\r\nsmall difficulty, but we accomplished it at last by the following means:\r\nFirst, we made a torch of a very inflammable nature out of the bark of a\r\ncertain tree, which we cut into strips, and after twisting, cemented\r\ntogether with a kind of resin or gum, which we also obtained from\r\nanother tree; neither of which trees, however, was known by name to\r\nJack.  This, when prepared, we wrapped up in a great number of plies of\r\ncocoa-nut cloth, so that we were confident it could not get wet during\r\nthe short time it should be under water.  Then we took a small piece of\r\nthe tinder, which we had carefully treasured up lest we should require\r\nit, as before said, when the sun should fail us; also, we rolled up some\r\ndry grass and a few chips, which, with a little bow and drill, like\r\nthose described before, we made into another bundle and wrapped it up in\r\ncocoa-nut cloth.  When all was ready we laid aside our garments, with\r\nthe exception of our trousers, which, as we did not know what rough\r\nscraping against the rocks we might be subjected to, we kept on.\r\n\r\nThen we advanced to the edge of the rocks--Jack carrying one bundle,\r\nwith the torch; I the other, with the things for producing fire.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't weary for us, Peterkin, should we be gone some time,\" said\r\nJack.  \"We'll be sure to return in half-an-hour at the very latest,\r\nhowever interesting the cave should be, that we may relieve your mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell!\" said Peterkin, coming up to us with a look of deep but\r\npretended solemnity, while he shook hands and kissed each of us on the\r\ncheek--\"farewell!  And while you are gone I shall repose my weary limbs\r\nunder the shelter of this bush, and meditate on the changefulness of all\r\nthings earthly, with special reference to the forsaken condition of a\r\npoor shipwrecked sailor-boy!\"  So saying, Peterkin waved his hand,\r\nturned from us, and cast himself upon the ground with a look of\r\nmelancholy resignation, which was so well feigned that I would have\r\nthought it genuine had he not accompanied it with a gentle wink.  We\r\nboth laughed, and springing from the rocks together, plunged head first\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nWe gained the interior of the submarine cave without difficulty, and on\r\nemerging from the waves, supported ourselves for some time by treading\r\nwater, while we held the two bundles above our heads.  This we did in\r\norder to let our eyes become accustomed to the obscurity.  Then, when we\r\ncould see sufficiently, we swam to a shelving rock, and landed in\r\nsafety.  Having wrung the water from our trousers, and dried ourselves\r\nas well as we could under the circumstances, we proceeded to ignite the\r\ntorch.  This we accomplished without difficulty in a few minutes; and no\r\nsooner did it flare up than we were struck dumb with the wonderful\r\nobjects that were revealed to our gaze.  The roof of the cavern just\r\nabove us seemed to be about ten feet high, but grew higher as it receded\r\ninto the distance until it was lost in darkness.  It seemed to be made\r\nof coral, and was supported by massive columns of the same material.\r\nImmense icicles (as they appeared to us) hung from it in various places.\r\nThese, however, were formed, not of ice, but of a species of limestone,\r\nwhich seemed to flow in a liquid form towards the point of each, where\r\nit became solid.  A good many drops fell, however, to the rock below,\r\nand these formed little cones, which rose to meet the points above.\r\nSome of them had already met, and thus we saw how the pillars were\r\nformed, which at first seemed to us as if they had been placed there by\r\nsome human architect to support the roof.  As we advanced farther in we\r\nsaw that the floor was composed of the same material as the pillars, and\r\nit presented the curious appearance of ripples such as are formed on\r\nwater when gently ruffled by the wind.  There were several openings on\r\neither hand in the walls that seemed to lead into other caverns, but\r\nthese we did not explore at this time.  We also observed that the\r\nceiling was curiously marked in many places, as if it were the fretwork\r\nof a noble cathedral; and the walls, as well as the roof, sparkled in\r\nthe light of our torch, and threw back gleams and flashes as if they\r\nwere covered with precious stones.  Although we proceeded far into this\r\ncavern, we did not come to the end of it; and we were obliged to return\r\nmore speedily than we would otherwise have done, as our torch was nearly\r\nexpended.  We did not observe any openings in the roof, or any\r\nindications of places whereby light might enter; but near the entrance\r\nto the cavern stood an immense mass of pure-white coral rock, which\r\ncaught and threw back the little light that found an entrance through\r\nthe cave's mouth, and thus produced, we conjectured, the pale-green\r\nobject which had first attracted our attention.  We concluded, also,\r\nthat the reflecting power of this rock was that which gave forth the dim\r\nlight that faintly illumined the first part of the cave.\r\n\r\nBefore diving through the passage again we extinguished the small piece\r\nof our torch that remained, and left it in a dry spot--conceiving that\r\nwe might possibly stand in need of it if, at any future time, we should\r\nchance to wet our torch while diving into the cavern.  As we stood for a\r\nfew minutes after it was out, waiting till our eyes became accustomed to\r\nthe gloom, we could not help remarking the deep, intense stillness and\r\nthe unutterable gloom of all around us; and as I thought of the\r\nstupendous dome above, and the countless gems that had sparkled in the\r\ntorchlight a few minutes before, it came into my mind to consider how\r\nstrange it is that God should make such wonderful and exquisitely\r\nbeautiful works never to be seen at all--except, indeed, by chance\r\nvisitors such as ourselves.\r\n\r\nI afterwards found that there were many such caverns among the islands\r\nof the South Seas, some of them larger and more beautiful than the one I\r\nhave just described.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Ralph, are you ready?\" said Jack in a low voice, that seemed to\r\necho up into the dome above.\r\n\r\n\"Quite ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then,\" said he; and plunging off the ledge of the rock into\r\nthe water, we dived through the narrow entrance.  In a few seconds we\r\nwere panting on the rocks above, and receiving the congratulations of\r\nour friend Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nSTRANGE PECULIARITY OF THE TIDES--ALSO OF THE TWILIGHT--PETERKIN'S\r\nREMARKABLE CONDUCT IN EMBRACING A LITTLE PIG AND KILLING A BIG SOW--SAGE\r\nREMARKS ON JESTING--ALSO ON LOVE.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a relief to us to breathe the pure air and to enjoy the\r\nglad sunshine after our long ramble in the Diamond Cave, as we named it;\r\nfor although we did not stay more than half-an-hour away, it seemed to\r\nus much longer.  While we were dressing, and during our walk home, we\r\ndid our best to satisfy the curiosity of poor Peterkin, who seemed to\r\nregret, with lively sincerity, his inability to dive.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it, however, so we condoled with him as we best\r\ncould.  Had there been any great rise or fall in the tide of these seas,\r\nwe might perhaps have found it possible to take him down with us at low\r\nwater; but as the tide never rose or fell more than eighteen inches or\r\ntwo feet, this was impossible.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity of the tide--its slight rise and fall--had not\r\nattracted our observation till some time after our residence on the\r\nisland.  Neither had we observed another curious circumstance until we\r\nhad been some time there.  This was the fact that the tide rose and fell\r\nwith constant regularity, instead of being affected by the changes of\r\nthe moon as in our own country, and as it is in most other parts of the\r\nworld--at least, in all those parts with which I am acquainted.  Every\r\nday and every night, at twelve o'clock precisely, the tide is at the\r\nfull; and at six o'clock, every morning and evening, it is ebb.  I can\r\nspeak with much confidence on this singular circumstance, as we took\r\nparticular note of it, and never found it to alter.  Of course I must\r\nadmit we had to guess the hour of twelve midnight, and I think we could\r\ndo this pretty correctly; but in regard to twelve noon we are quite\r\npositive, because we easily found the highest point that the sun reached\r\nin the sky by placing ourselves at a certain spot whence we observed the\r\nsharp summit of a cliff resting against the sky, just where the sun\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nJack and I were surprised that we had not noticed this the first few\r\ndays of our residence here, and could only account for it by our being\r\nso much taken up with the more obvious wonders of our novel situation.\r\nI have since learned, however, that this want of observation is a sad\r\nand very common infirmity of human nature, there being hundreds of\r\npersons before whose eyes the most wonderful things are passing every\r\nday who nevertheless, are totally ignorant of them.  I therefore have to\r\nrecord my sympathy with such persons, and to recommend to them a course\r\nof conduct which I have now for a long time myself adopted--namely, the\r\nhabit of forcing my attention upon all things that go on around me, and\r\nof taking some degree of interest in them whether I feel it naturally or\r\nnot.  I suggest this the more earnestly, though humbly, because I have\r\nvery frequently come to know that my indifference to a thing has\r\ngenerally been caused by my ignorance in regard to it.\r\n\r\nWe had much serious conversation on this subject of the tides; and Jack\r\ntold us, in his own quiet, philosophical way, that these tides did great\r\ngood to the world in many ways, particularly in the way of cleansing the\r\nshores of the land, and carrying off the filth that was constantly\r\npoured into the sea therefrom--which, Peterkin suggested, was remarkably\r\ntidy of it to do.  Poor Peterkin could never let slip an opportunity to\r\njoke, however inopportune it might be, which at first we found rather a\r\ndisagreeable propensity, as it often interrupted the flow of very\r\nagreeable conversation--and, indeed, I cannot too strongly record my\r\ndisapprobation of this tendency in general; but we became so used to it\r\nat last that we found it no interruption whatever.  Indeed, strange to\r\nsay, we came to feel that it was a necessary part of our enjoyment (such\r\nis the force of habit), and found the sudden outbursts of mirth,\r\nresulting from his humorous disposition, quite natural and refreshing to\r\nus in the midst of our more serious conversations.  But I must not\r\nmisrepresent Peterkin.  We often found, to our surprise, that he knew\r\nmany things which we did not; and I also observed that those things\r\nwhich he learned from experience were never forgotten.  From all these\r\nthings I came at length to understand that things very opposite and\r\ndissimilar in themselves, when united, do make an agreeable whole; as,\r\nfor example, we three on this our island, although most unlike in many\r\nthings, when united, made a trio so harmonious that I question if there\r\never met before such an agreeable triumvirate.  There was, indeed, no\r\nnote of discord whatever in the symphony we played together on that\r\nsweet Coral Island; and I am now persuaded that this was owing to our\r\nhaving been all tuned to the same key--namely, that of _love_!  Yes, we\r\nloved one another with much fervency while we lived on that island; and,\r\nfor the matter of that, we love each other still.\r\n\r\nAnd while I am on this subject, or rather the subject that just preceded\r\nit--namely, the tides--I may here remark on another curious natural\r\nphenomenon.  We found that there was little or no twilight in this\r\nisland.  We had a distinct remembrance of the charming long twilight at\r\nhome, which some people think the most delightful part of the day--\r\nthough, for my part, I have always preferred sunrise; and when we first\r\nlanded, we used to sit down on some rocky point or eminence, at the\r\nclose of our day's work, to enjoy the evening breeze, but no sooner had\r\nthe sun sunk below the horizon than all became suddenly dark.  This\r\nrendered it necessary that we should watch the sun when we happened to\r\nbe out hunting; for to be suddenly left in the dark while in the woods\r\nwas very perplexing, as, although the stars shone with great beauty and\r\nbrilliancy, they could not pierce through the thick umbrageous boughs\r\nthat interlaced above our heads.\r\n\r\nBut to return.  After having told all we could to Peterkin about the\r\nDiamond Cave under Spouting Cliff, as we named the locality, we were\r\nwending our way rapidly homewards when a grunt and a squeal were borne\r\ndown by the land breeze to our ears.\r\n\r\n\"That's the ticket!\" was Peterkin's remarkable exclamation as he started\r\nconvulsively and levelled his spear.\r\n\r\n\"Hist!\" cried Jack; \"these are your friends, Peterkin.  They must have\r\ncome over expressly to pay you a friendly visit, for it is the first\r\ntime we have seen them on this side of the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along!\" cried Peterkin, hurrying towards the wood; while Jack and\r\nI followed, smiling at his impatience.\r\n\r\nAnother grunt and half-a-dozen squeals, much louder than before, came\r\ndown the valley.  At this time we were just opposite the small vale\r\nwhich lay between the Valley of the Wreck and Spouting Cliff.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Peterkin!\" cried Jack in a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is't?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay a bit, man!  These grunters are just up there on the hillside.  If\r\nyou go and stand with Ralph in the lee of yon cliff I'll cut round\r\nbehind and drive them through the gorge, so that you'll have a better\r\nchance of picking out a good one.  Now, mind you pitch into a fat young\r\npig, Peterkin!\" added Jack as he sprang into the bushes.\r\n\r\n\"Won't I, just!\" said Peterkin, licking his lips, as we took our station\r\nbeside the cliff.  \"I feel quite a tender affection for young pigs in my\r\nheart.  Perhaps it would be more correct to say in my tum--\"\r\n\r\n\"There they come!\" cried I as a terrific yell from Jack sent the whole\r\nherd screaming down the hill.  Now Peterkin, being unable to hold back,\r\ncrept a short way up a very steep grassy mound in order to get a better\r\nview of the hogs before they came up; and just as he raised his head\r\nabove its summit, two little pigs, which had outrun their companions,\r\nrushed over the top with the utmost precipitation.  One of these brushed\r\nclose past Peterkin's ear; the other, unable to arrest its headlong\r\nflight, went, as Peterkin himself afterwards expressed it, `bash' into\r\nhis arms with a sudden squeal, which was caused more by the force of the\r\nblow than the will of the animal, and both of them rolled violently down\r\nto the foot of the mound.  No sooner was this reached than the little\r\npig recovered its feet, tossed up its tail, and fled shrieking from the\r\nspot.  But I slung a large stone after it, which, being fortunately well\r\naimed, hit it behind the ear and felled it to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Capital, Ralph! that's your sort!\" cried Peterkin, who, to my surprise\r\nand great relief, had risen to his feet apparently unhurt, though much\r\ndishevelled.  He rushed frantically towards the gorge, which the yells\r\nof the hogs told us they were now approaching.  I had made up my mind\r\nthat I would abstain from killing another, as, if Peterkin should be\r\nsuccessful, two were more than sufficient for our wants at the present\r\ntime.  Suddenly they all burst forth--two or three little round ones in\r\nadvance, and an enormous old sow with a drove of hogs at her heels.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Peterkin,\" said I, \"there's a nice little fat one; just spear it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Peterkin did not move; he allowed it to pass unharmed.  I looked at\r\nhim in surprise, and saw that his lips were compressed and his eyebrows\r\nknitted, as if he were about to fight with some awful enemy.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"  I inquired with some trepidation.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he levelled his spear, darted forward, and with a yell that\r\nnearly froze the blood in my veins, stabbed the old sow to the heart.\r\nNay, so vigorously was it done that the spear went in at one side and\r\ncame out at the other!\r\n\r\n\"Oh Peterkin!\" said I, going up to him, \"what have you done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Done?  I've killed their great-great-grandmother, that's all,\" said he,\r\nlooking with a somewhat awestruck expression at the transfixed animal.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! what's this?\" said Jack as he came up.  \"Why, Peterkin, you must\r\nbe fond of a tough chop.  If you mean to eat this old hog, she'll try\r\nyour jaws, I warrant.  What possessed you to stick _her_, Peterkin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the fact is, I want a pair of shoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have your shoes to do with the old hog?\" said I, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"My present shoes have certainly nothing to do with her,\" replied\r\nPeterkin; \"nevertheless, she will have a good deal to do with my future\r\nshoes.  The fact is, when I saw you floor that pig so neatly, Ralph, it\r\nstruck me that there was little use in killing another.  Then I\r\nremembered all at once that I had long wanted some leather or tough\r\nsubstance to make shoes of, and this old grandmother seemed so tough\r\nthat I just made up my mind to stick her--and you see I've done it!\"\r\n\r\n\"That you certainly have, Peterkin,\" said Jack as he was examining the\r\ntransfixed animal.\r\n\r\nWe now considered how we were to carry our game home, for, although the\r\ndistance was short, the hog was very heavy.  At length we hit on the\r\nplan of tying its four feet together, and passing the spear-handle\r\nbetween them.  Jack took one end on his shoulder, I took the other on\r\nmine, and Peterkin carried the small pig.\r\n\r\nThus we returned in triumph to our bower, laden, as Peterkin remarked,\r\nwith the glorious spoils of a noble hunt.  As he afterwards spoke in\r\nsimilarly glowing terms in reference to the supper that followed, there\r\nis every reason to believe that we retired that night to our leafy beds\r\nin a high state of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nBOAT-BUILDING EXTRAORDINARY--PETERKIN TRIES HIS HAND AT COOKERY, AND\r\nFAILS MOST SIGNALLY--THE BOAT FINISHED--CURIOUS CONVERSATION WITH THE\r\nCAT, AND OTHER MATTERS.\r\n\r\nFor many days after this, Jack applied himself with unremitting\r\nassiduity to the construction of our boat, which at length began to look\r\nsomething like one.  But those only who have had the thing to do can\r\nentertain a right idea of the difficulty involved in such an\r\nundertaking, with no other implements than an axe, a bit of hoop-iron, a\r\nsail-needle, and a broken penknife.  But Jack did it.  He was of that\r\ndisposition which _will_ not be conquered.  When he believed himself to\r\nbe acting rightly, he overcame all obstacles.  I have seen Jack, when\r\ndoubtful whether what he was about to do were right or wrong, as timid\r\nand vacillating as a little girl; and I honour him for it!\r\n\r\nAs this boat was a curiosity in its way, a few words here relative to\r\nthe manner of its construction may not be amiss.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the chestnut-tree with its wonderful buttresses\r\nor planks.  This tree, then, furnished us with the chief part of our\r\nmaterial.  First of all, Jack sought out a limb of a tree of such a form\r\nand size as, while it should form the keel, a bend at either end should\r\nform the stem and stern-posts.  Such a piece, however, was not easy to\r\nobtain; but at last he procured it by rooting up a small tree which had\r\na branch growing at the proper angle about ten feet up its stem, with\r\ntwo strong roots growing in such a form as enabled him to make a\r\nflat-sterned boat.  This placed, he procured three branching roots of\r\nsuitable size, which he fitted to the keel at equal distances, thus\r\nforming three strong ribs.  Now the squaring and shaping of these, and\r\nthe cutting of the grooves in the keel, was an easy enough matter, as it\r\nwas all work for the axe, in the use of which Jack was become\r\nwonderfully expert; but it was quite a different affair when he came to\r\nnailing the ribs to the keel, for we had no instrument capable of boring\r\na large hole, and no nails to fasten them with.  We were, indeed, much\r\nperplexed here; but Jack at length devised an instrument that served\r\nvery well.  He took the remainder of our hoop-iron and beat it into the\r\nform of a pipe or cylinder, about as thick as a man's finger.  This he\r\ndid by means of our axe and the old rusty axe we had found at the house\r\nof the poor man at the other side of the island.  This, when made red\r\nhot, bored slowly through the timbers; and the better to retain the\r\nheat, Jack shut up one end of it and filled it with sand.  True, the\r\nwork was very slowly done; but it mattered not--we had little else to\r\ndo.  Two holes were bored in each timber, about an inch and a half\r\napart, and also down into the keel, but not quite through.  Into these\r\nwere placed stout pegs made of a tree called iron-wood, and when they\r\nwere hammered well home, the timbers were as firmly fixed as if they had\r\nbeen nailed with iron.  The gunwales, which were very stout, were fixed\r\nin a similar manner.  But besides the wooden nails, they were firmly\r\nlashed to the stem and stern-posts and ribs by means of a species of\r\ncordage which we had contrived to make out of the fibrous husk of the\r\ncocoa-nut.  This husk was very tough, and when a number of the threads\r\nwere joined together they formed excellent cordage.  At first we tied\r\nthe different lengths together; but this was such a clumsy and awkward\r\ncomplication of knots that we contrived, by careful interlacing of the\r\nends together before twisting, to make good cordage of any size or\r\nlength we chose.  Of course it cost us much time and infinite labour;\r\nbut Jack kept up our spirits when we grew weary, and so all that we\r\nrequired was at last constructed.\r\n\r\nPlanks were now cut off the chestnut-trees of about an inch thick.\r\nThese were dressed with the axe--but clumsily, for an axe is ill-adapted\r\nfor such work.  Five of these planks on each side were sufficient; and\r\nwe formed the boat in a very rounded, barrel-like shape, in order to\r\nhave as little twisting of the planks as possible, for although we could\r\neasily bend them, we could not easily twist them.  Having no nails to\r\nrivet the planks with, we threw aside the ordinary fashion of\r\nboat-building and adopted one of our own.  The planks were therefore\r\nplaced on each other's edges, and sewed together with the tough cordage\r\nalready mentioned; they were also thus sewed to the stem, the stern, and\r\nthe keel.  Each stitch or tie was six inches apart, and was formed thus:\r\nThree holes were bored in the upper plank and three in the lower, the\r\nholes being above each other--that is, in a vertical line.  Through\r\nthese holes the cord was passed, and when tied, formed a powerful stitch\r\nof three-ply.  Besides this, we placed between the edges of the planks\r\nlayers of cocoa-nut fibre, which, as it swelled when wetted, would, we\r\nhoped, make our little vessel water-tight.  But in order further to\r\nsecure this end, we collected a large quantity of pitch from the\r\nbread-fruit tree, with which, when boiled in our old iron pot, we paid\r\nthe whole of the inside of the boat, and while it was yet hot, placed\r\nlarge pieces of cocoa-nut cloth on it, and then gave it another coat\r\nabove that.  Thus the interior was covered with a tough, water-tight\r\nmaterial; while the exterior, being uncovered, and so exposed to the\r\nswelling action of the water, was, we hoped, likely to keep the boat\r\nquite dry.  I may add that our hopes were not disappointed.\r\n\r\nWhile Jack was thus engaged, Peterkin and I sometimes assisted him; but\r\nas our assistance was not much required, we more frequently went\r\na-hunting on the extensive mud-flats at the entrance of the long valley\r\nwhich lay nearest to our bower.  Here we found large flocks of ducks of\r\nvarious kinds, some of them bearing so much resemblance to the wild\r\nducks of our own country that I think they must have been the same.  On\r\nthese occasions we took the bow and the sling, with both of which we\r\nwere often successful, though I must confess that I was the least so.\r\nOur suppers were thus pleasantly varied, and sometimes we had such a\r\nprofusion spread out before us that we frequently knew not with which of\r\nthe dainties to begin.\r\n\r\nI must also add that the poor old cat which we had brought home had\r\nalways a liberal share of our good things; and so well was it looked\r\nafter, especially by Peterkin, that it recovered much of its former\r\nstrength, and seemed to improve in sight as well as hearing.\r\n\r\nThe large flat stone, or rock of coral, which stood just in front of the\r\nentrance to our bower, was our table.  On this rock we had spread out\r\nthe few articles we possessed the day we were shipwrecked; and on the\r\nsame rock, during many a day afterwards, we spread out the bountiful\r\nsupply with which we had been blessed on our Coral Island.  Sometimes we\r\nsat down at this table to a feast consisting of hot rolls--as Peterkin\r\ncalled the newly baked bread-fruit--a roast pig, roast duck, boiled and\r\nroasted yams, cocoa-nuts, taro, and sweet potatoes; which we followed up\r\nwith a dessert of plums, apples, and plantains--the last being a\r\nlarge-sized and delightful fruit, which grew on a large shrub or tree\r\nnot more than twelve feet high, with light-green leaves of enormous\r\nlength and breadth.  These luxurious feasts were usually washed down\r\nwith cocoa-nut lemonade.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Peterkin tried to devise some new dish--\"a conglomerate,\"\r\nas he used to say; but these generally turned out such atrocious\r\ncompounds that he was ultimately induced to give up his attempts in\r\nextreme disgust--not forgetting, however, to point out to Jack that his\r\nfailure was a direct contradiction to the proverb which he (Jack) was\r\nconstantly thrusting down his throat--namely, that \"where there's a will\r\nthere's a way.\"  For he had a great will to become a cook, but could by\r\nno means find a way to accomplish that end.\r\n\r\nOne day, while Peterkin and I were seated beside our table, on which\r\ndinner was spread, Jack came up from the beach, and flinging down his\r\naxe, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"There, lads, the boat's finished at last!  So we've nothing to do now\r\nbut shape two pair of oars, and then we may put to sea as soon as we\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\nThis piece of news threw us into a state of great joy; for although we\r\nwere aware that the boat had been gradually getting near its completion,\r\nit had taken so long that we did not expect it to be quite ready for at\r\nleast two or three weeks.  But Jack had wrought hard and said nothing,\r\nin order to surprise us.\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow,\" cried Peterkin, \"you're a perfect trump!  But why did\r\nyou not tell us it was so nearly ready?  Won't we have a jolly sail\r\nto-morrow, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so much, Peterkin,\" said Jack; \"and, pray, hand me a bit of\r\nthat pig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my dear,\" cried Peterkin, seizing the axe.  \"What part will\r\nyou have?  A leg, or a wing, or a piece of the breast--which?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hind leg, if you please,\" answered Jack; \"and, pray, be so good as to\r\ninclude the tail.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart,\" said Peterkin, exchanging the axe for his hoop-iron\r\nknife, with which he cut off the desired portion.  \"I'm only too glad,\r\nmy dear boy, to see that your appetite is so wholesale, and there's no\r\nchance whatever of its dwindling down into re-tail again--at least, in\r\nso far as this pig is concerned.--Ralph, lad, why don't you laugh, eh?\"\r\nhe added, turning suddenly to me with a severe look of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"Laugh!\" said I.  \"What at, Peterkin?  Why should I laugh?\"\r\n\r\nBoth Jack and Peterkin answered this inquiry by themselves laughing so\r\nimmoderately that I was induced to believe I had missed noticing some\r\ngood joke, so I begged that it might be explained to me; but as this\r\nonly produced repeated roars of laughter, I smiled and helped myself to\r\nanother slice of plantain.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but,\" continued Peterkin, \"I was talking of a sail to-morrow.\r\nCan't we have one, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Jack, \"we can't have a sail; but I hope we shall have a\r\nrow, as I intend to work hard at the oars this afternoon, and if we\r\ncan't get them finished by sunset, we'll light our candle-nuts, and turn\r\nthem out of hands before we turn into bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Peterkin, tossing a lump of pork to the cat, who\r\nreceived it with a mew of satisfaction.  \"I'll help you, if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards,\" continued Jack, \"we will make a sail out of the cocoa-nut\r\ncloth, and rig up a mast; and then we shall be able to sail to some of\r\nthe other islands, and visit our old friends the penguins.\"\r\n\r\nThe prospect of being so soon in a position to extend our observations\r\nto the other islands, and enjoy a sail over the beautiful sea, afforded\r\nus much delight, and after dinner we set about making the oars in good\r\nearnest.  Jack went into the woods and blocked them roughly out with the\r\naxe, and I smoothed them down with the knife, while Peterkin remained in\r\nthe bower spinning, or rather twisting, some strong, thick cordage with\r\nwhich to fasten them to the boat.\r\n\r\nWe worked hard and rapidly, so that when the sun went down Jack and I\r\nreturned to the bower with four stout oars, which required little to be\r\ndone to them save a slight degree of polishing with the knife.  As we\r\ndrew near we were suddenly arrested by the sound of a voice.  We were\r\nnot a little surprised at this--indeed, I may almost say alarmed; for\r\nalthough Peterkin was undoubtedly fond of talking, we had never, up to\r\nthis time, found him talking to himself.  We listened intently, and\r\nstill heard the sound of a voice as if in conversation.  Jack motioned\r\nme to be silent, and advancing to the bower on tiptoe, we peeped in.\r\n\r\nThe sight that met our gaze was certainly not a little amusing.  On the\r\ntop of a log which we sometimes used as a table sat the black cat with a\r\nvery demure expression on its countenance, and in front of it, sitting\r\non the ground with his legs extended on either side of the log, was\r\nPeterkin.  At the moment we saw him he was gazing intently into the\r\ncat's face, with his nose about four inches from it, his hands being\r\nthrust into his breeches pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Cat,\" said Peterkin, turning his head a little on one side, \"I love\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, as if Peterkin awaited a reply to this affectionate\r\ndeclaration.  But the cat said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear me?\" cried Peterkin sharply.  \"I love you--I do!  Don't you\r\nlove me?\"\r\n\r\nTo this touching appeal the cat said \"mew\" faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's right!  You're a jolly old rascal!  Why did you not speak at\r\nonce, eh?\" and Peterkin put forward his mouth and kissed the cat on the\r\nnose!\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Peterkin after a pause, \"I love you.  D'you think I'd\r\nsay so if I didn't, you black villain?  I love you because I've got to\r\ntake care of you, and to look after you, and to think about you, and to\r\nsee that you don't die--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mew, me-a-w!\" said the cat.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" continued Peterkin; \"quite true, I have no doubt.  But\r\nyou've no right to interrupt me, sir.  Hold your tongue till I have done\r\nspeaking.  Moreover, cat, I love you because you came to me the first\r\ntime you ever saw me, and didn't seem to be afraid, and appeared to be\r\nfond of me, though you didn't know that I wasn't going to kill you.  Now\r\nthat was brave, that was bold, and very jolly, old boy, and I love you\r\nfor it--I do!\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was a pause of a few minutes, during which the cat looked\r\nplacid, and Peterkin dropped his eyes upon its toes as if in\r\ncontemplation.  Suddenly he looked up.\r\n\r\n\"Well, cat, what are you thinking about now?  Won't speak, eh?  Now tell\r\nme: don't you think it's a monstrous shame that those two scoundrels,\r\nJack and Ralph, should keep us waiting for our supper so long?\"\r\n\r\nHere the cat arose, put up its back and stretched itself, yawned\r\nslightly, and licked the point of Peterkin's nose!\r\n\r\n\"Just so, old boy; you're a clever fellow.--I really do believe the\r\nbrute understands me!\" said Peterkin, while a broad grin overspread his\r\nface as he drew back and surveyed the cat.\r\n\r\nAt this point Jack burst into a loud fit of laughter.  The cat uttered\r\nan angry fuff and fled, while Peterkin sprang up and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Bad luck to you, Jack!  You've nearly made the heart jump out of my\r\nbody, you have!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I have,\" replied Jack, laughing, as we entered the bower; \"but\r\nas I don't intend to keep you or the cat any longer from your supper, I\r\nhope that you'll both forgive me.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin endeavoured to turn this affair off with a laugh.  But I\r\nobserved that he blushed very deeply at the time we discovered\r\nourselves, and he did not seem to relish any allusion to the subject\r\nafterwards; so we refrained from remarking on it ever after, though it\r\ntickled us not a little at the time.\r\n\r\nAfter supper we retired to rest, and to dream of wonderful adventures in\r\nour little boat and distant voyages upon the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE BOAT LAUNCHED--WE VISIT THE CORAL REEF--THE GREAT BREAKER THAT NEVER\r\nGOES DOWN--CORAL INSECTS--THE WAY IN WHICH CORAL ISLANDS ARE MADE--THE\r\nBOATS SAIL--WE TAX OUR INGENUITY TO FORM FISH-HOOKS--SOME OF THE FISH WE\r\nSAW--AND A MONSTROUS WHALE--WONDERFUL SHOWER OF LITTLE FISH--\r\nWATERSPOUTS.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, clear, beautiful morning when we first launched our\r\nlittle boat and rowed out upon the placid waters of the lagoon.  Not a\r\nbreath of wind ruffled the surface of the deep.  Not a cloud spotted the\r\ndeep-blue sky.  Not a sound that was discordant broke the stillness of\r\nthe morning, although there were many sounds--sweet, tiny, and\r\nmelodious--that mingled in the universal harmony of nature.  The sun was\r\njust rising from the Pacific's ample bosom, and tipping the\r\nmountain-tops with a red glow.  The sea was shining like a sheet of\r\nglass, yet heaving with the long, deep swell that, all the world round,\r\nindicates the life of Ocean; and the bright seaweeds and the brilliant\r\ncorals shone in the depths of that pellucid water, as we rowed over it,\r\nlike rare and precious gems.  Oh, it was a sight fitted to stir the soul\r\nof man to its profoundest depths! and if he owned a heart at all, to\r\nlift that heart in adoration and gratitude to the great Creator of this\r\nmagnificent and glorious universe!\r\n\r\nAt first, in the strength of our delight, we rowed hither and thither\r\nwithout aim or object.  But after the effervescence of our spirits was\r\nabated, we began to look about us and to consider what we should do.\r\n\r\n\"I vote that we row to the reef,\" cried Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"And I vote that we visit the islands within the lagoon,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"And I vote we do both,\" cried Jack; \"so pull away, boys!\"\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, we had made four oars; but our boat was so small\r\nthat only two were necessary.  The extra pair were reserved in case any\r\naccident should happen to the others.  It was therefore only needful\r\nthat two of us should row, while the third steered by means of an oar--\r\nand relieved the rowers occasionally.\r\n\r\nFirst we landed on one of the small islands and ran all over it, but saw\r\nnothing worthy of particular notice.  Then we landed on a larger island,\r\non which were growing a few cocoa-nut trees.  Not having eaten anything\r\nthat morning, we gathered a few of the nuts and breakfasted.  After this\r\nwe pulled straight out to sea, and landed on the coral reef.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a novel and interesting sight to us.  We had now been so\r\nlong on shore that we had almost forgotten the appearance of breakers,\r\nfor there were none within the lagoon.  But now, as we stood beside the\r\nfoam-crested billow of the open sea, all the enthusiasm of the sailor\r\nwas awakened in our breasts; and as we gazed on the widespread ruin of\r\nthat single magnificent breaker that burst in thunder at our feet, we\r\nforgot the Coral Island behind us, we forgot our bower and the calm\r\nrepose of the scented woods, we forgot all that had passed during the\r\nlast few months, and remembered nothing but the storms, the calms, the\r\nfresh breezes, and the surging billows of the open sea.\r\n\r\nThis huge, ceaseless breaker, to which I have so often alluded, was a\r\nmuch larger and more sublime object than we had at all imagined it to\r\nbe.  It rose many yards above the level of the sea, and could be seen\r\napproaching at some distance from the reef.  Slowly and majestically it\r\ncame on, acquiring greater volume and velocity as it advanced, until it\r\nassumed the form of a clear watery arch, which sparkled in the bright\r\nsun.  On it came with resistless and solemn majesty, the upper edge\r\nlipped gently over, and it fell with a roar that seemed as though the\r\nheart of Ocean were broken in the crash of tumultuous water, while the\r\nfoam-clad coral reef appeared to tremble beneath the mighty shock!\r\n\r\nWe gazed long and wonderingly at this great sight, and it was with\r\ndifficulty we could tear ourselves away from it.  As I have once before\r\nmentioned, this wave broke in many places over the reef and scattered\r\nsome of its spray into the lagoon; but in most places the reef was\r\nsufficiently broad and elevated to receive and check its entire force.\r\nIn many places the coral rocks were covered with vegetation--the\r\nbeginning, as it appeared to us, of future islands.  Thus, on this reef,\r\nwe came to perceive how most of the small islands of those seas are\r\nformed.  On one part we saw the spray of the breaker washing over the\r\nrocks, and millions of little, active, busy creatures continuing the\r\nwork of building up this living rampart.  At another place, which was\r\njust a little too high for the waves to wash over it, the coral insects\r\nwere all dead; for we found that they never did their work above water.\r\nThey had faithfully completed the mighty work which their Creator had\r\ngiven them to do, and they were now all dead.  Again, in other spots the\r\nceaseless lashing of the sea had broken the dead coral in pieces, and\r\ncast it up in the form of sand.  Here sea-birds had alighted, little\r\npieces of seaweed and stray bits of wood had been washed up, seeds of\r\nplants had been carried by the wind, and a few lovely blades of bright\r\ngreen had already sprung up, which, when they died, would increase the\r\nsize and fertility of these emeralds of Ocean.  At other places these\r\nislets had grown apace, and were shaded by one or two cocoa-nut trees,\r\nwhich grew literally in the sand, and were constantly washed by the\r\nocean spray--yet, as I have before remarked, their fruit was most\r\nrefreshing and sweet to our taste.\r\n\r\nAgain, at this time Jack and I pondered the formation of the large coral\r\nislands.  We could now understand how the low ones were formed; but the\r\nlarger islands cost us much consideration, yet we could arrive at no\r\ncertain conclusion on the subject.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied our curiosity, and enjoyed ourselves during the whole\r\nday in our little boat, we returned, somewhat wearied, and withal rather\r\nhungry, to our bower.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Jack, \"as our boat answers so well we will get a mast and\r\nsail made immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we will!\" cried Peterkin as we all assisted to drag the boat above\r\nhigh-water mark.  \"We'll light our candle and set about it this very\r\nnight.  Hurrah, my boys, pull away!\"\r\n\r\nAs we dragged our boat, we observed that she grated heavily on her keel;\r\nand as the sands were in this place mingled with broken coral rocks, we\r\nsaw portions of the wood being scraped off.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" cried Jack on seeing this, \"that won't do.  Our keel will be\r\nworn off in no time at this rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it will,\" said I, pondering deeply as to how this might be\r\nprevented.  But I am not of a mechanical turn naturally, so I could\r\nconceive no remedy save that of putting a plate of iron on the keel; but\r\nas we had no iron, I knew not what was to be done.  \"It seems to me,\r\nJack,\" I added, \"that it is impossible to prevent the keel being worn\r\noff thus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible?\" cried Peterkin.  \"My dear Ralph, you are mistaken; there\r\nis nothing so easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"  I inquired in some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Why, by not using the boat at all!\" replied Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your impudent tongue, Peterkin!\" said Jack as he shouldered the\r\noars.  \"Come along with me, and I'll give you work to do.  In the first\r\nplace, you will go and collect coca-nut fibre, and set to work to make\r\nsewing-twine with it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, captain,\" interrupted Peterkin, \"I've got lots of it made\r\nalready--more than enough, as a little friend of mine used to be in the\r\nhabit of saying every day after dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" continued Jack; \"then you'll help Ralph to collect\r\ncocoa-nut cloth and cut it into shape, after which we'll make a sail of\r\nit.  I'll see to getting the mast and the gearing; so let's to work.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to work we went right busily, so that in three days from that time\r\nwe had set up a mast and sail, with the necessary rigging, in our little\r\nboat.  The sail was not, indeed, very handsome to look at, as it was\r\nformed of a number of oblong patches of cloth; but we had sewed it well\r\nby means of our sail-needle, so that it was strong, which was the chief\r\npoint.--Jack had also overcome the difficulty about the keel by pinning\r\nto it a _false_ keel.  This was a piece of tough wood, of the same\r\nlength and width as the real keel, and about five inches deep.  He made\r\nit of this depth because the boat would be thereby rendered not only\r\nmuch more safe, but more able to beat against the wind--which, in a sea\r\nwhere the trade-winds blow so long and so steadily in one direction, was\r\na matter of great importance.  This piece of wood was pegged very firmly\r\nto the keel; and we now launched our boat with the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that when the false keel should be scraped off we could easily\r\nput on another,--whereas, should the real keel have been scraped away,\r\nwe could not have renewed it without taking our boat to pieces, which\r\nPeterkin said made his \"marrow quake to think upon.\"\r\n\r\nThe mast and sail answered excellently; and we now sailed about in the\r\nlagoon with great delight, and examined with much interest the\r\nappearance of our island from a distance.  Also, we gazed into the\r\ndepths of the water, and watched for hours the gambols of the curious\r\nand bright-coloured fish among the corals and seaweed.  Peterkin also\r\nmade a fishing-line; and Jack constructed a number of hooks, some of\r\nwhich were very good, others remarkably bad.  Some of these hooks were\r\nmade of iron-wood--which did pretty well, the wood being extremely\r\nhard--and Jack made them very thick and large.  Fish there are not\r\nparticular.  Some of the crooked bones in fish-heads also answered for\r\nthis purpose pretty well.  But that which formed our best and most\r\nserviceable hook was the brass finger-ring belonging to Jack.  It gave\r\nhim not a little trouble to manufacture it.  First he cut it with the\r\naxe, then twisted it into the form of a hook.  The barb took him several\r\nhours to cut.  He did it by means of constant sawing with the broken\r\npenknife.  As for the point, an hour's rubbing on a piece of sandstone\r\nmade an excellent one.\r\n\r\nIt would be a matter of much time and labour to describe the appearance\r\nof the multitudes of fish that were day after day drawn into our boat by\r\nmeans of the brass hook.  Peterkin always caught them--for we observed\r\nthat he derived much pleasure from fishing--while Jack and I found ample\r\namusement in looking on, also in gazing down at the coral groves, and in\r\nbaiting the hook.  Among the fish that we saw, but did not catch, were\r\nporpoises and swordfish, whales and sharks.  The porpoises came\r\nfrequently into our lagoon in shoals, and amused us not a little by\r\ntheir bold leaps into the air and their playful gambols in the sea.  The\r\nswordfish were wonderful creatures--some of them apparently ten feet in\r\nlength, with an ivory spear six or eight feet long projecting from their\r\nnoses.  We often saw them darting after other fish, and no doubt they\r\nsometimes killed them with their ivory swords.  Jack remembered having\r\nheard once of a swordfish attacking a ship, which seemed strange indeed;\r\nbut as they are often in the habit of attacking whales, perhaps it\r\nmistook the ship for one.  This swordfish ran against the vessel with\r\nsuch force that it drove its sword quite through the thick planks; and\r\nwhen the ship arrived in harbour, long afterwards, the sword was found\r\nstill sticking in it!\r\n\r\nSharks did not often appear; but we took care never again to bathe in\r\ndeep water without leaving one of our number in the boat, to give us\r\nwarning if he should see a shark approaching.  As for the whales, they\r\nnever came into our lagoon; but we frequently saw them spouting in the\r\ndeep water beyond the reef.  I shall never forget my surprise the first\r\nday I saw one of these huge monsters close to me.  We had been rambling\r\nabout on the reef during the morning, and were about to re-embark in our\r\nlittle boat to return home, when a loud blowing sound caused us to wheel\r\nrapidly round.  We were just in time to see a shower of spray falling,\r\nand the flukes or tail of some monstrous fish disappear in the sea a few\r\nhundred yards off.  We waited some time to see if he would rise again.\r\nAs we stood, the sea seemed to open up at our very feet; an immense\r\nspout of water was sent with a snort high into the air, and the huge,\r\nblunt head of a sperm-whale rose before us.  It was so large that it\r\ncould easily have taken our little boat, along with ourselves, into its\r\nmouth!  It plunged slowly back into the sea, like a large ship\r\nfoundering, and struck the water with its tail so forcibly as to cause a\r\nsound like a cannon-shot.\r\n\r\nWe also saw a great number of flying-fish, although we caught none; and\r\nwe noticed that they never flew out of the water except when followed by\r\ntheir bitter foe the dolphin, from whom they thus endeavoured to escape.\r\nBut of all the fish that we saw, none surprised us so much as those\r\nthat we used to find in shallow pools after a shower of rain; and this\r\nnot on account of their appearance, for they were ordinary-looking and\r\nvery small, but on account of their having descended in a shower of\r\nrain!  We could account for them in no other way, because the pools in\r\nwhich we found these fish were quite dry before the shower, and at some\r\ndistance above high-water mark.  Jack, however, suggested a cause which\r\nseemed to me very probable.  We used often to see waterspouts in the\r\nsea.  A waterspout is a whirling body of water, which rises from the sea\r\nlike a sharp-pointed pillar.  After rising a good way, it is met by a\r\nlong tongue, which comes down from the clouds; and when the two have\r\njoined, they look something like an hour-glass.  The waterspout is then\r\ncarried by the wind--sometimes gently, sometimes with violence--over the\r\nsea, sometimes up into the clouds; and then, bursting asunder, it\r\ndescends in a deluge.  This often happens over the land as well as over\r\nthe sea; and it sometimes does much damage, but frequently it passes\r\ngently away.  Now, Jack thought that the little fish might perhaps have\r\nbeen carried up in a waterspout, and so sent down again in a shower of\r\nrain.  But we could not be certain as to this point, yet we thought it\r\nlikely.\r\n\r\nDuring these delightful fishing and boating excursions we caught a good\r\nmany eels, which we found to be very good to eat.  We also found turtles\r\namong the coral rocks, and made excellent soup in our iron kettle.\r\nMoreover, we discovered many shrimps and prawns, so that we had no lack\r\nof variety in our food; and, indeed, we never passed a week without\r\nmaking some new and interesting discovery of some sort or other, either\r\non the land or in the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nA MONSTER WAVE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES--THE BOAT LOST AND FOUND--PETERKIN'S\r\nTERRIBLE ACCIDENT--SUPPLIES OF FOOD FOR A VOYAGE IN THE BOAT--WE VISIT\r\nPENGUIN ISLAND, AND ARE AMAZED BEYOND MEASURE--ACCOUNT OF THE PENGUINS.\r\n\r\nOne day, not long after our little boat was finished, we were sitting on\r\nthe rocks at Spouting Cliff, and talking of an excursion which we\r\nintended to make to Penguin Island the next day.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Peterkin, \"it might be all very well for a stupid fellow\r\nlike me to remain here and leave the penguins alone; but it would be\r\nquite inconsistent with your characters as philosophers to remain any\r\nlonger in ignorance of the habits and customs of these birds, so the\r\nsooner we go the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" said I.  \"There is nothing I desire so much as to have a\r\ncloser inspection of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I think,\" said Jack, \"that you had better remain at home, Peterkin,\r\nto take care of the cat; for I'm sure the hogs will be at it in your\r\nabsence, out of revenge for your killing their great-grandmother so\r\nrecklessly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay at home!\" cried Peterkin.  \"My dear fellow, you would certainly\r\nlose your way, or get upset, if I were not there to take care of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, true!\" said Jack gravely; \"that did not occur to me.  No doubt you\r\nmust go.  Our boat does require a good deal of ballast; and all that you\r\nsay, Peterkin, carries so much weight with it that we won't need stones\r\nif you go.\"\r\n\r\nNow, while my companions were talking, a notable event occurred, which,\r\nas it is not generally known, I shall be particular in recording here.\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking, as I have said, we noticed a dark line, like a\r\nlow cloud or fog-bank, on the seaward horizon.  The day was a fine one,\r\nthough cloudy, and a gentle breeze was blowing; but the sea was not\r\nrougher, or the breaker on the reef higher, than usual.  At first we\r\nthought that this looked like a thundercloud, and as we had had a good\r\ndeal of broken weather of late, accompanied by occasional peals of\r\nthunder, we supposed that a storm must be approaching.  Gradually,\r\nhowever, this line seemed to draw nearer without spreading up over the\r\nsky, as would certainly have been the case if it had been a storm-cloud.\r\nStill nearer it came, and soon we saw that it was moving swiftly\r\ntowards the island; but there was no sound till it reached the islands\r\nout at sea.  As it passed these islands we observed, with no little\r\nanxiety, that a cloud of white foam encircled them, and burst in spray\r\ninto the air; it was accompanied by a loud roar.  This led us to\r\nconjecture that the approaching object was an enormous wave of the sea;\r\nbut we had no idea how large it was till it came near to ourselves.\r\nWhen it approached the outer reef, however, we were awestruck with its\r\nunusual magnitude; and we sprang to our feet, and clambered hastily up\r\nto the highest point of the precipice, under an indefinable feeling of\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nI have said before that the reef opposite Spouting Cliff was very near\r\nto the shore, while just in front of the bower it was at a considerable\r\ndistance out to sea.  Owing to this formation, the wave reached the reef\r\nat the latter point before it struck at the foot of Spouting Cliff.  The\r\ninstant it touched the reef we became aware, for the first time, of its\r\nawful magnitude.  It burst completely over the reef at all points with a\r\nroar that seemed louder to me than thunder, and this roar continued for\r\nsome seconds while the wave rolled gradually along towards the cliff on\r\nwhich we stood.  As its crest reared before us we felt that we were in\r\ngreat danger, and turned to flee; but we were too late.  With a crash\r\nthat seemed to shake the solid rock, the gigantic billow fell, and\r\ninstantly the spouting-holes sent up a gush of waterspouts with such\r\nforce that they shrieked on issuing from their narrow vents.  It seemed\r\nto us as if the earth had been blown up with water.  We were stunned and\r\nconfused by the shock, and so drenched and blinded with spray that we\r\nknew not for a few moments whither to flee for shelter.  At length we\r\nall three gained an eminence beyond the reach of the water.  But what a\r\nscene of devastation met our gaze as we looked along the shore!  This\r\nenormous wave not only burst over the reef, but continued its way across\r\nthe lagoon, and fell on the sandy beach of the island with such force\r\nthat it passed completely over it and dashed into the woods, levelling\r\nthe smaller trees and bushes in its headlong course.\r\n\r\nOn seeing this, Jack said he feared our bower must have been swept away,\r\nand that the boat, which was on the beach, must have been utterly\r\ndestroyed.  Our hearts sank within us as we thought of this, and we\r\nhastened round through the woods towards our home.  On reaching it we\r\nfound, to our great relief of mind, that the force of the wave had been\r\nexpended just before reaching the bower; but the entrance to it was\r\nalmost blocked up by the torn-up bushes and tangled heaps of seaweed.\r\nHaving satisfied ourselves as to the bower, we hurried to the spot where\r\nthe boat had been left; but no boat was there.  The spot on which it had\r\nstood was vacant, and no sign of it could we see on looking around us.\r\n\r\n\"It may have been washed up into the woods,\" said Jack, hurrying up the\r\nbeach as he spoke.  Still no boat was to be seen, and we were about to\r\ngive ourselves over to despair when Peterkin called to Jack and said:\r\n\r\n\"Jack, my friend, you were once so exceedingly sagacious and wise as to\r\nmake me acquainted with the fact that cocoa-nuts grow upon trees.  Will\r\nyou now be so good as to inform me what sort of fruit that is growing on\r\nthe top of yonder bush? for I confess to being ignorant, or at least\r\ndoubtful, on the point.\"\r\n\r\nWe looked towards the bush indicated, and there, to our surprise, beheld\r\nour little boat snugly nestled among the leaves.  We were very much\r\noverjoyed at this, for we would have suffered any loss rather than the\r\nloss of our boat.  We found that the wave had actually borne the boat on\r\nits crest from the beach into the woods, and there launched it into the\r\nheart of this bush, which was extremely fortunate; for had it been\r\ntossed against a rock or a tree, it would have been dashed to pieces,\r\nwhereas it had not received the smallest injury.  It was no easy matter,\r\nhowever, to get it out of the bush and down to the sea again.  This cost\r\nus two days of hard labour to accomplish.\r\n\r\nWe had also much ado to clear away the rubbish from before the bower,\r\nand spent nearly a week in constant labour ere we got the neighbourhood\r\nto look as clean and orderly as before; for the uprooted bushes and\r\nseaweed that lay on the beach formed a more dreadfully confused-looking\r\nmass than one who had not seen the place after the inundation could\r\nconceive.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject I may mention, for the sake of those who\r\ninterest themselves in the curious natural phenomena of our world, that\r\nthis gigantic wave occurs regularly on some of the islands of the\r\nPacific once, and sometimes twice, in the year.  I heard this stated by\r\nthe missionaries during my career in those seas.  They could not tell me\r\nwhether it visited all of the islands, but I was certainly assured that\r\nit occurred periodically in some of them.\r\n\r\nAfter we had got our home put to rights, and cleared of the debris of\r\nthe inundation, we again turned our thoughts to paying the penguins a\r\nvisit.  The boat was therefore overhauled and a few repairs done.  Then\r\nwe prepared a supply of provisions, for we intended to be absent at\r\nleast a night or two--perhaps longer.  This took us some time to do;\r\nfor, while Jack was busy with the boat, Peterkin was sent into the woods\r\nto spear a hog or two, and had to search long, sometimes, ere he found\r\nthem.  Peterkin was usually sent on this errand when we wanted a pork\r\nchop (which was not seldom), because he was so active and could run so\r\nwonderfully fast that he found no difficulty in overtaking the hogs; but\r\nbeing dreadfully reckless, he almost invariably tumbled over stumps and\r\nstones in the course of his wild chase, and seldom returned home without\r\nhaving knocked the skin off his shins.  Once, indeed, a more serious\r\naccident happened to him.  He had been out all the morning alone, and\r\ndid not return at the usual time to dinner.  We wondered at this, for\r\nPeterkin was always very punctual at the dinner-hour.  As supper-time\r\ndrew near we began to be anxious about him, and at length sallied forth\r\nto search the woods.  For a long time we sought in vain; but a little\r\nbefore dark we came upon the tracks of the hogs, which we followed up\r\nuntil we came to the brow of a rather steep bank or precipice.  Looking\r\nover this, we beheld Peterkin lying in a state of insensibility at the\r\nfoot, with his cheek resting on the snout of a little pig, which was\r\npinned to the earth by the spear.  We were dreadfully alarmed, but\r\nhastened to bathe his forehead with water, and had soon the satisfaction\r\nof seeing him revive.  After we had carried him home, he related to us\r\nhow the thing had happened.\r\n\r\n\"You must know,\" said he, \"I walked about all the forenoon, till I was\r\nas tired as an old donkey, without seeing a single grunter--not so much\r\nas a track of one; but as I was determined not to return empty-handed, I\r\nresolved to go without my dinner, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Jack, \"did you _really_ resolve to do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jack, hold your tongue,\" returned Peterkin.  \"I say that I\r\nresolved to forego my dinner and to push to the head of the small\r\nvalley, where I felt pretty sure of discovering the hogs.  I soon found\r\nthat I was on the right scent, for I had scarcely walked half-a-mile in\r\nthe direction of the small plum-tree we found there the other day when a\r\nsqueak fell on my ear.  `Ho, ho,' said I, `there you go, my boys;' and I\r\nhurried up the glen.  I soon started them, and singling out a fat pig,\r\nran tilt at him.  In a few seconds I was up with him, and stuck my spear\r\nright through his dumpy body.  Just as I did so, I saw that we were on\r\nthe edge of a precipice--whether high or low, I knew not; but I had been\r\nrunning at such a pace that I could not stop, so the pig and I gave a\r\nhowl in concert and went plunging over together.  I remembered nothing\r\nmore after that till I came to my senses, and found you bathing my\r\ntemples, and Ralph wringing his hands over me.\"\r\n\r\nBut although Peterkin was often unfortunate in the way of getting\r\ntumbles, he was successful on the present occasion in hunting, and\r\nreturned before evening with three very nice little hogs.  I also was\r\nsuccessful in my visit to the mud-flats, where I killed several ducks.\r\nSo that when we launched and loaded our boat at sunrise the following\r\nmorning, we found our store of provisions to be more than sufficient.\r\nPart had been cooked the night before, and on taking note of the\r\ndifferent items, we found the account to stand thus:\r\n\r\n  10 Bread-fruits (two baked, eight unbaked).\r\n  20 Yams (six roasted, the rest raw).\r\n  6 Taro-roots.\r\n  50 Fine large plums.\r\n  6 Cocoa-nuts, ripe.\r\n  6 Ditto, green (for drinking).\r\n  4 Large ducks and two small ones, raw.\r\n  3 Cold roast pigs, with stuffing.\r\n\r\nI may here remark that the stuffing had been devised by Peterkin\r\nspecially for the occasion.  He kept the manner of its compounding a\r\nprofound secret, so I cannot tell what it was; but I can say, with much\r\nconfidence, that we found it to be atrociously bad, and after the first\r\ntasting, scraped it carefully out and threw it overboard.  We calculated\r\nthat this supply would last us for several days; but we afterwards found\r\nthat it was much more than we required, especially in regard to the\r\ncocoa-nuts, of which we found large supplies wherever we went.  However,\r\nas Peterkin remarked, it was better to have too much than too little, as\r\nwe knew not to what straits we might be put during our voyage.\r\n\r\nIt was a very calm, sunny morning when we launched forth and rowed over\r\nthe lagoon towards the outlet in the reef, and passed between the two\r\ngreen islets that guarded the entrance.  We experienced some difficulty\r\nand no little danger in passing the surf of the breaker, and shipped a\r\ngood deal of water in the attempt; but once past the billow, we found\r\nourselves floating placidly on the long, oily swell that rose and fell\r\nslowly as it rolled over the wide ocean.\r\n\r\nPenguin Island lay on the other side of our own island, at about a mile\r\nbeyond the outer reef, and we calculated that it must be at least twenty\r\nmiles distant by the way we should have to go.  We might, indeed, have\r\nshortened the way by coasting round our island inside of the lagoon, and\r\ngoing out at the passage in the reef nearly opposite to Penguin Island;\r\nbut we preferred to go by the open sea--first, because it was more\r\nadventurous, and secondly, because we should have the pleasure of again\r\nfeeling the motion of the deep, which we all loved very much, not being\r\nliable to sea-sickness.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had a breeze,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" cried Peterkin, resting on his oar and wiping his heated\r\nbrow; \"pulling is hard work.  Oh dear, if we could only catch a hundred\r\nor two of these gulls, tie them to the boat with long strings, and make\r\nthem fly as we want them, how capital it would be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or bore a hole through a shark's tail and reeve a rope through it, eh?\"\r\nremarked Jack.  \"But, I say, it seems that my wish is going to be\r\ngranted, for here comes a breeze.  Ship your oar, Peterkin.--Up with the\r\nmast, Ralph; I'll see to the sail.  Mind your helm; look out for\r\nsqualls!\"\r\n\r\nThis last speech was caused by the sudden appearance of a dark-blue line\r\non the horizon, which, in an incredibly short space of time, swept down\r\non us, lashing up the sea in white foam as it went.  We presented the\r\nstern of the boat to its first violence, and in a few seconds it\r\nmoderated into a steady breeze, to which we spread our sail and flew\r\nmerrily over the waves.  Although the breeze died away soon afterwards,\r\nit had been so stiff while it lasted that we were carried over the\r\ngreater part of our way before it fell calm again; so that when the\r\nflapping of the sail against the mast told us that it was time to resume\r\nthe oars, we were not much more than a mile from Penguin Island.\r\n\r\n\"There go the soldiers!\" cried Peterkin as we came in sight of it.  \"How\r\nspruce their white trousers look this morning!  I wonder if they will\r\nreceive us kindly?--D'you think they are hospitable, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk, Peterkin, but pull away, and you shall see shortly.\"\r\n\r\nAs we drew near to the island, we were much amused by the manoeuvres and\r\nappearance of these strange birds.  They seemed to be of different\r\nspecies: for some had crests on their heads, while others had none; and\r\nwhile some were about the size of a goose, others appeared nearly as\r\nlarge as a swan.  We also saw a huge albatross soaring above the heads\r\nof the penguins.  It was followed and surrounded by numerous flocks of\r\nsea-gulls.  Having approached to within a few yards of the island, which\r\nwas a low rock, with no other vegetation on it than a few bushes, we lay\r\non our oars and gazed at the birds with surprise and pleasure, they\r\nreturning our gaze with interest.  We now saw that their soldierlike\r\nappearance was owing to the stiff erect manner in which they sat on\r\ntheir short legs--\"bolt-upright,\" as Peterkin expressed it.  They had\r\nblack heads, long, sharp beaks, white breasts, and bluish backs.  Their\r\nwings were so short that they looked more like the fins of a fish, and\r\nindeed we soon saw that they used them for the purpose of swimming under\r\nwater.  There were no quills on these wings, but a sort of scaly\r\nfeathers, which also thickly covered their bodies.  Their legs were\r\nshort, and placed so far back that the birds, while on land, were\r\nobliged to stand quite upright in order to keep their balance; but in\r\nthe water they floated like other water-fowl.  At first we were so\r\nstunned with the clamour which they and other sea-birds kept up around\r\nus that we knew not which way to look, for they covered the rocks in\r\nthousands; but as we continued to gaze, we observed several quadrupeds\r\n(as we thought) walking in the midst of the penguins.\r\n\r\n\"Pull in a bit,\" cried Peterkin, \"and let's see what these are.  They\r\nmust be fond of noisy company to consort with such creatures.\"\r\n\r\nTo our surprise, we found that these were no other than penguins which\r\nhad gone down on all fours, and were crawling among the bushes on their\r\nfeet and wings, just like quadrupeds.  Suddenly one big old bird, that\r\nhad been sitting on a point very near to us, gazing in mute\r\nastonishment, became alarmed, and scuttling down the rocks, plumped or\r\nfell, rather than ran, into the sea.  It dived in a moment, and, a few\r\nseconds afterwards, came out of the water far ahead with such a spring,\r\nand such a dive back into the sea again, that we could scarcely believe\r\nit was not a fish that had leaped in sport.\r\n\r\n\"That beats everything!\" said Peterkin, rubbing his nose, and screwing\r\nup his face with an expression of exasperated amazement.  \"I've heard of\r\na thing being neither fish, flesh, nor fowl; but I never did expect to\r\nlive to see a brute that was all three together--at once--in one!  But\r\nlook there!\" he continued, pointing with a look of resignation to the\r\nshore--\"look there! there's no end to it.  What has that brute got under\r\nits tail?\"\r\n\r\nWe turned to look in the direction pointed out, and there saw a penguin\r\nwalking slowly and very sedately along the shore with an egg under its\r\ntail.  There were several others, we observed, burdened in the same way;\r\nand we found afterwards that these were a species of penguin that always\r\ncarried their eggs so.  Indeed, they had a most convenient cavity for\r\nthe purpose, just between the tail and the legs.  We were very much\r\nimpressed with the regularity and order of this colony.  The island\r\nseemed to be apportioned out into squares, of which each penguin\r\npossessed one, and sat in stiff solemnity in the middle of it, or took a\r\nslow march up and down the spaces between.  Some were hatching their\r\neggs, but others were feeding their young ones in a manner that caused\r\nus to laugh not a little.  The mother stood on a mound or raised rock,\r\nwhile the young one stood patiently below her on the ground.  Suddenly\r\nthe mother raised her head and uttered a series of the most discordant\r\ncackling sounds.\r\n\r\n\"She's going to choke,\" cried Peterkin.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the case, although, I confess, she looked like it.  In\r\na few seconds she put down her head and opened her mouth, into which the\r\nyoung one thrust its beak and seemed to suck something from her throat.\r\nThen the cackling was renewed, the sucking continued, and so the\r\noperation of feeding was carried on till the young one was satisfied;\r\nbut what she fed her little one with we could not tell.\r\n\r\n\"Now, just look yonder!\" said Peterkin in an excited tone.  \"If that\r\nisn't the most abominable piece of maternal deception I ever saw!  That\r\nrascally old lady penguin has just pitched her young one into the sea,\r\nand there's another about to follow her example.\"\r\n\r\nThis indeed seemed to be the case, for on the top of a steep rock close\r\nto the edge of the sea we observed an old penguin endeavouring to entice\r\nher young one into the water; but the young one seemed very unwilling to\r\ngo, and notwithstanding the enticements of its mother, moved very slowly\r\ntowards her.  At last she went gently behind the young bird and pushed\r\nit a little towards the water, but with great tenderness, as much as to\r\nsay, \"Don't be afraid, darling; I won't hurt you, my pet!\"  But no\r\nsooner did she get it to the edge of the rock, where it stood looking\r\npensively down at the sea, than she gave it a sudden and violent push,\r\nsending it headlong down the slope into the water, where its mother left\r\nit to scramble ashore as it best could.  We observed many of them\r\nemployed in doing this, and we came to the conclusion that this is the\r\nway in which old penguins teach their children to swim.\r\n\r\nScarcely had we finished making our remarks on this, when we were\r\nstartled by about a dozen of the old birds hopping in the most clumsy\r\nand ludicrous manner towards the sea.  The beach here was a sloping\r\nrock, and when they came to it some of them succeeded in hopping down in\r\nsafety, but others lost their balance and rolled and scrambled down the\r\nslope in the most helpless manner.  The instant they reached the water,\r\nhowever, they seemed to be in their proper element.  They dived, and\r\nbounded out of it and into it again with the utmost agility; and so,\r\ndiving and bounding and sputtering--for they could not fly--they went\r\nrapidly out to sea.\r\n\r\nOn seeing this, Peterkin turned with a grave face to us and said, \"It's\r\nmy opinion that these birds are all stark, staring mad, and that this is\r\nan enchanted island.  I therefore propose that we should either put\r\nabout ship and fly in terror from the spot, or land valorously on the\r\nisland and sell our lives as dearly as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I vote for landing; so pull in, lads!\" said Jack, giving a stroke with\r\nhis oar that made the boat spin.  In a few seconds we ran the boat into\r\na little creek, where we made her fast to a projecting piece of coral,\r\nand running up the beach, entered the ranks of the penguins, armed with\r\nour cudgels and our spear.  We were greatly surprised to find that\r\ninstead of attacking us, or showing signs of fear at our approach, these\r\ncurious birds did not move from their places until we laid hands on\r\nthem, and merely turned their eyes on us in solemn, stupid wonder as we\r\npassed.  There was one old penguin, however, that began to walk slowly\r\ntowards the sea; and Peterkin took it into his head that he would try to\r\ninterrupt its progress, so he ran between it and the sea and brandished\r\nhis cudgel in its face.  But this proved to be a resolute old bird.  It\r\nwould not retreat; nay, more, it would not cease to advance, but battled\r\nwith Peterkin bravely, and drove him before it until it reached the sea.\r\nHad Peterkin used his club he could easily have felled it, no doubt;\r\nbut as he had no wish to do so cruel an act merely out of sport, he let\r\nthe bird escape.\r\n\r\nWe spent fully three hours on this island in watching the habit of these\r\ncurious birds; but when we finally left them, we all three concluded,\r\nafter much consultation, that they were the most wonderful creatures we\r\nhad ever seen, and further, we thought it probable that they were the\r\nmost wonderful creatures in the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nAN AWFUL STORM AND ITS CONSEQUENCES--NARROW ESCAPE--A ROCK PROVES A SURE\r\nFOUNDATION--A FEARFUL NIGHT AND A BRIGHT MORNING--DELIVERANCE FROM\r\nDANGER.\r\n\r\nIt was evening before we left the island of the penguins.  As we had\r\nmade up our minds to encamp for the night on a small island whereon grew\r\na few cocoa-nut trees, which was about two miles off, we lay-to our oars\r\nwith some energy.  But a danger was in store for us which we had not\r\nanticipated.  The wind, which had carried us so quickly to Penguin\r\nIsland, freshened as evening drew on to a stiff breeze, and before we\r\nhad made half the distance to the small island, it became a regular\r\ngale.  Although it was not so directly against us as to prevent our\r\nrowing in the course we wished to go, yet it checked us very much; and\r\nalthough the force of the sea was somewhat broken by the island, the\r\nwaves soon began to rise and to roll their broken crests against our\r\nsmall craft, so that she began to take in water, and we had much ado to\r\nkeep ourselves afloat.  At last the wind and sea together became so\r\nviolent that we found it impossible to make the island; so Jack suddenly\r\nput the head of the boat round, and ordered Peterkin and me to hoist a\r\ncorner of the sail, intending to run back to Penguin Island.\r\n\r\n\"We shall at least have the shelter of the bushes,\" he said as the boat\r\nflew before the wind, \"and the penguins will keep us company.\"\r\n\r\nAs Jack spoke, the wind suddenly shifted and blew so much against us\r\nthat we were forced to hoist more of the sail in order to beat up for\r\nthe island, being by this change thrown much to leeward of it.  What\r\nmade matters worse was that the gale came in squalls, so that we were\r\nmore than once nearly upset.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by, both of you!\" cried Jack in a quick, earnest tone.  \"Be ready\r\nto deuce the sail.  I very much fear we won't make the island after\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin and I were so much in the habit of trusting everything to Jack\r\nthat we had fallen into the way of not considering things, especially\r\nsuch things as were under Jack's care.  We had, therefore, never doubted\r\nfor a moment that all was going well, so that it was with no little\r\nanxiety that we heard him make the above remark.  However, we had no\r\ntime for question or surmise, for at the moment he spoke a heavy squall\r\nwas bearing down upon us, and as we were then flying with our lee\r\ngunwale dipping occasionally under the waves, it was evident that we\r\nshould have to lower our sail altogether.  In a few seconds the squall\r\nstruck the boat; but Peterkin and I had the sail down in a moment, so\r\nthat it did not upset us.  But when it was past we were more than\r\nhalf-full of water.  This I soon bailed out, while Peterkin again\r\nhoisted a corner of the sail.  But the evil which Jack had feared came\r\nupon us.  We found it quite impossible to make Penguin Island.  The gale\r\ncarried us quickly past it towards the open sea, and the terrible truth\r\nflashed upon us that we should be swept out and left to perish miserably\r\nin a small boat in the midst of the wide ocean.\r\n\r\nThis idea was forced very strongly upon us, because we saw nothing in\r\nthe direction whither the wind was blowing us save the raging billows of\r\nthe sea; and indeed we trembled as we gazed around us, for we were now\r\nbeyond the shelter of the islands, and it seemed as though any of the\r\nhuge billows, which curled over in masses of foam, might swallow us up\r\nin a moment.  The water also began to wash in over our sides, and I had\r\nto keep constantly bailing; for Jack could not quit the helm, nor\r\nPeterkin the sail, for an instant, without endangering our lives.  In\r\nthe midst of this distress Jack uttered an exclamation of hope, and\r\npointed towards a low island or rock which lay directly ahead.  It had\r\nbeen hitherto unobserved, owing to the dark clouds that obscured the sky\r\nand the blinding spray that seemed to fill the whole atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs we neared this rock we observed that it was quite destitute of trees\r\nand verdure, and so low that the sea broke completely over it.  In fact,\r\nit was nothing more than the summit of one of the coral formations,\r\nwhich rose only a few feet above the level of the water, and was, in\r\nstormy weather, all but invisible.  Over this island the waves were\r\nbreaking in the utmost fury, and our hearts sank within us as we saw\r\nthat there was not a spot where we could thrust our little boat without\r\nits being dashed to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Show a little bit more sail!\" cried Jack as we swept past the weather\r\nside of the rock with fearful speed.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay!\" answered Peterkin, hoisting about a foot more of our sail.\r\n\r\nLittle though the addition was, it caused the boat to lie over and creak\r\nso loudly, as we cleft the foaming waves, that I expected to be upset\r\nevery instant; and I blamed Jack in my heart for his rashness.  But I\r\ndid him injustice; for although during two seconds the water rushed\r\ninboard in a torrent, he succeeded in steering us sharply round to the\r\nleeward side of the rock, where the water was comparatively calm and the\r\nforce of the breeze broken.\r\n\r\n\"Out your oars now, lads!  That's well done!  Give way!\"  We obeyed\r\ninstantly.  The oars splashed into the waves together.  One good, hearty\r\npull, and we were floating in a comparatively calm creek that was so\r\nnarrow as to be barely able to admit our boat.  Here we were in perfect\r\nsafety, and as we leaped on shore and fastened our cable to the rocks, I\r\nthanked God in my heart for our deliverance from so great danger.  But\r\nalthough I have said we were now in safety, I suspect that few of my\r\nreaders would have envied our position.  It is true we had no lack of\r\nfood; but we were drenched to the skin; the sea was foaming round us,\r\nand the spray flying over our heads, so that we were completely\r\nenveloped, as it were, in water; the spot on which we had landed was not\r\nmore than twelve yards in diameter, and from this spot we could not move\r\nwithout the risk of being swept away by the storm.  At the upper end of\r\nthe creek was a small hollow or cave in the rock, which sheltered us\r\nfrom the fury of the winds and waves; and as the rock extended in a sort\r\nof ledge over our heads, it prevented the spray from falling upon us.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Peterkin, beginning to feel cheery again, \"it seems to me\r\nthat we have got into a mermaid's cave, for there is nothing but water\r\nall round us; and as for earth and sky, they are things of the past.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin's idea was not inappropriate, for what with the sea roaring in\r\nwhite foam up to our very feet, and the spray flying in white sheets\r\ncontinually over our heads, and the water dripping heavily from the\r\nledge above like a curtain in front of our cave, it did seem to us very\r\nmuch more like being below than above water.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys,\" cried Jack, \"bestir yourselves, and let's make ourselves\r\ncomfortable.--Toss out our provisions, Peterkin; and here, Ralph, lend a\r\nhand to haul up the boat.  Look sharp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, captain!\" we cried as we hastened to obey, much cheered by the\r\nhearty manner of our comrade.\r\n\r\nFortunately the cave, although not very deep, was quite dry, so that we\r\nsucceeded in making ourselves much more comfortable than could have been\r\nexpected.  We landed our provisions, wrung the water out of our\r\ngarments, spread our sail below us for a carpet, and after having eaten\r\na hearty meal, began to feel quite cheerful.  But as night drew on our\r\nspirits sank again, for with the daylight all evidence of our security\r\nvanished away.  We could no longer see the firm rock on which we lay,\r\nwhile we were stunned with the violence of the tempest that raged around\r\nus.  The night grew pitchy dark as it advanced, so that we could not see\r\nour hands when we held them up before our eyes, and were obliged to feel\r\neach other occasionally to make sure that we were safe, for the storm at\r\nlast became so terrible that it was difficult to make our voices\r\naudible.  A slight variation of the wind, as we supposed, caused a few\r\ndrops of spray ever and anon to blow into our faces; and the eddy of the\r\nsea, in its mad boiling, washed up into our little creek until it\r\nreached our feet and threatened to tear away our boat.  In order to\r\nprevent this latter calamity, we hauled the boat farther up and held the\r\ncable in our hands.  Occasional flashes of lightning shone with a\r\nghastly glare through the watery curtains around us, and lent additional\r\nhorror to the scene.  Yet we longed for those dismal flashes, for they\r\nwere less appalling than the thick blackness that succeeded them.\r\nCrashing peals of thunder seemed to tear the skies in twain, and fell\r\nupon our ears through the wild yelling of the hurricane as if it had\r\nbeen but a gentle summer breeze; while the billows burst upon the\r\nweather side of the island until we fancied that the solid rock was\r\ngiving way, and in our agony we clung to the bare ground, expecting\r\nevery moment to be whirled away and whelmed in the black, howling sea.\r\nOh, it was a night of terrible anxiety! and no one can conceive the\r\nfeelings of intense gratitude and relief with which we at last saw the\r\ndawn of day break through the vapoury mists around us.\r\n\r\nFor three days and three nights we remained on this rock, while the\r\nstorm continued to rage with unabated fury.  On the morning of the\r\nfourth day it suddenly ceased, and the wind fell altogether; but the\r\nwaves still ran so high that we did not dare to put off in our boat.\r\nDuring the greater part of this period we scarcely slept above a few\r\nminutes at a time; but on the third night we slept soundly, and awoke\r\nearly on the fourth morning to find the sea very much down, and the sun\r\nshining brightly again in the clear blue sky.\r\n\r\nIt was with light hearts that we launched forth once more in our little\r\nboat and steered away for our island home, which, we were overjoyed to\r\nfind, was quite visible on the horizon, for we had feared that we had\r\nbeen blown out of sight of it altogether.  As it was a dead calm, we had\r\nto row during the greater part of the day; but towards the afternoon a\r\nfair breeze sprang up, which enabled us to hoist our sail.  We soon\r\npassed Penguin Island and the other island which we had failed to reach\r\non the day the storm commenced; but as we had still enough of\r\nprovisions, and were anxious to get home, we did not land--to the great\r\ndisappointment of Peterkin, who seemed to entertain quite an affection\r\nfor the penguins.\r\n\r\nAlthough the breeze was pretty fresh for several hours, we did not reach\r\nthe outer reef of our island till nightfall; and before we had sailed\r\nmore than a hundred yards into the lagoon, the wind died away\r\naltogether, so that we had to take to our oars again.  It was late, and\r\nthe moon and stars were shining brightly when we arrived opposite the\r\nbower and leaped upon the strand.  So glad were we to be safe back again\r\non our beloved island that we scarcely took time to drag the boat a\r\nshort way up the beach, and then ran up to see that all was right at the\r\nbower.  I must confess, however, that my joy was mingled with a vague\r\nsort of fear lest our home had been visited and destroyed during our\r\nabsence; but on reaching it we found everything just as it had been\r\nleft, and the poor black cat curled up, sound asleep, on the coral table\r\nin front of our humble dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nSHOEMAKING--THE EVEN TENOR OF OUR WAY SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED--AN\r\nUNEXPECTED VISIT AND AN APPALLING BATTLE--WE ALL BECOME WARRIORS, AND\r\nJACK PROVES HIMSELF TO BE A HERO.\r\n\r\nFor many months after this we continued to live on our island in\r\nuninterrupted harmony and happiness.  Sometimes we went out a-fishing in\r\nthe lagoon, and sometimes went a-hunting in the woods, or ascended to\r\nthe mountain-top by way of variety, although Peterkin always asserted\r\nthat we went for the purpose of hailing any ship that might chance to\r\nheave in sight.  But I am certain that none of us wished to be delivered\r\nfrom our captivity, for we were extremely happy; and Peterkin used to\r\nsay that as we were very young, we should not feel the loss of a year or\r\ntwo.  Peterkin, as I have said before, was thirteen years of age, Jack\r\neighteen, and I fifteen.  But Jack was very tall, strong, and manly for\r\nhis age, and might easily have been mistaken for twenty.\r\n\r\nThe climate was so beautiful that it seemed to be a perpetual summer,\r\nand as many of the fruit-trees continued to bear fruit and blossom all\r\nthe year round, we never wanted for a plentiful supply of food.  The\r\nhogs, too, seemed rather to increase than diminish, although Peterkin\r\nwas very frequent in his attacks on them with his spear.  If at any time\r\nwe failed in finding a drove, we had only to pay a visit to the\r\nplum-tree before mentioned, where we always found a large family of them\r\nasleep under its branches.\r\n\r\nWe employed ourselves very busily during this time in making various\r\ngarments of cocoa-nut cloth, as those with which we had landed were\r\nbeginning to be very ragged.  Peterkin also succeeded in making\r\nexcellent shoes out of the skin of the old hog in the following manner:\r\nHe first cut a piece of the hide, of an oblong form, a few inches longer\r\nthan his foot.  This he soaked in water, and while it was wet he sewed\r\nup one end of it so as to form a rough imitation of that part of the\r\nheel of a shoe where the seam is.  This done, he bored a row of holes\r\nall round the edge of the piece of skin, through which a tough line was\r\npassed.  Into the sewed-up part of this shoe he thrust his heel; then,\r\ndrawing the string tight, the edges rose up and overlapped his foot all\r\nround.  It is true there were a great many ill-looking puckers in these\r\nshoes; but we found them very serviceable notwithstanding, and Jack came\r\nat last to prefer them to his long boots.  We also made various other\r\nuseful articles, which added to our comfort, and once or twice spoke of\r\nbuilding us a house; but we had so great an affection for the bower, and\r\nwithal found it so serviceable, that we determined not to leave it, nor\r\nto attempt the building of a house, which in such a climate might turn\r\nout to be rather disagreeable than useful.\r\n\r\nWe often examined the pistol that we had found in the house on the other\r\nside of the island, and Peterkin wished much that we had powder and\r\nshot, as it would render pig-killing much easier; but, after all, we had\r\nbecome so expert in the use of our sling and bow and spear that we were\r\nindependent of more deadly weapons.\r\n\r\nDiving in the Water Garden also continued to afford us as much pleasure\r\nas ever, and Peterkin began to be a little more expert in the water from\r\nconstant practice.  As for Jack and me, we began to feel as if water\r\nwere our native element, and revelled in it with so much confidence and\r\ncomfort that Peterkin said he feared we would turn into fish some day\r\nand swim off and leave him, adding that he had been for a long time\r\nobserving that Jack was becoming more and more like a shark every day.\r\nWhereupon Jack remarked that if he (Peterkin) were changed into a fish,\r\nhe would certainly turn into nothing better or bigger than a shrimp.\r\nPoor Peterkin did not envy us our delightful excursions under water--\r\nexcept, indeed, when Jack would dive down to the bottom of the Water\r\nGarden, sit down on a rock, and look up and make faces at him.  Peterkin\r\ndid feel envious then, and often said he would give anything to be able\r\nto do that.  I was much amused when Peterkin said this; for if he could\r\nonly have seen his own face when he happened to take a short dive, he\r\nwould have seen that Jack's was far surpassed by it--the great\r\ndifference being, however, that Jack made faces on purpose, Peterkin\r\ncouldn't help it!\r\n\r\nNow, while we were engaged with these occupations and amusements, an\r\nevent occurred one day which was as unexpected as it was exceedingly\r\nalarming and very horrible.\r\n\r\nJack and I were sitting, as we were often wont to do, on the rocks at\r\nSpouting Cliff, and Peterkin was wringing the water from his garments,\r\nhaving recently fallen by accident into the sea--a thing he was\r\nconstantly doing--when our attention was suddenly arrested by two\r\nobjects which appeared on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"What are yon, think you?\"  I said, addressing Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I can't imagine,\" answered he.  \"I've noticed them for some time, and\r\nfancied they were black sea-gulls; but the more I look at them, the more\r\nI feel convinced they are much larger than gulls.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem to be coming towards us,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! what's wrong?\" inquired Peterkin, coming up.\r\n\r\n\"Look there,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Whales!\" cried Peterkin, shading his eyes with his hand.  \"No--eh--can\r\nthey be boats, Jack?\"\r\n\r\nOur hearts beat with excitement at the very thought of seeing human\r\nfaces again.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are about right, Peterkin.  But they seem to me to move\r\nstrangely for boats,\" said Jack in a low tone, as if he were talking to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nI noticed that a shade of anxiety crossed Jack's countenance as he gazed\r\nlong and intently at the two objects, which were now nearing us fast.\r\nAt last he sprang to his feet.  \"They are canoes, Ralph! whether\r\nwar-canoes or not, I cannot tell; but this I know--that all the natives\r\nof the South Sea Islands are fierce cannibals, and they have little\r\nrespect for strangers.  We must hide if they land here, which I\r\nearnestly hope they will not do.\"\r\n\r\nI was greatly alarmed at Jack's speech; but I confess I thought less of\r\nwhat he said than of the earnest, anxious manner in which he said it,\r\nand it was with very uncomfortable feelings that Peterkin and I followed\r\nhim quickly into the woods.\r\n\r\n\"How unfortunate,\" said I as we gained the shelter of the bushes, \"that\r\nwe have forgotten our arms!\"\r\n\r\n\"It matters not,\" said Jack; \"here are clubs enough and to spare.\"  As\r\nhe spoke, he laid his hand on a bundle of stout poles of various sizes,\r\nwhich Peterkin's ever-busy hands had formed, during our frequent visits\r\nto the cliff, for no other purpose, apparently, than that of having\r\nsomething to do.\r\n\r\nWe each selected a stout club according to our several tastes and lay\r\ndown behind a rock, whence we could see the canoes approach without\r\nourselves being seen.  At first we made an occasional remark on their\r\nappearance; but after they entered the lagoon and drew near the beach,\r\nwe ceased to speak, and gazed with intense interest at the scene before\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWe now observed that the foremost canoe was being chased by the other,\r\nand that it contained a few women and children as well as men--perhaps\r\nforty souls altogether--while the canoe which pursued it contained only\r\nmen.  They seemed to be about the same in number, but were better armed,\r\nand had the appearance of being a war-party.  Both crews were paddling\r\nwith all their might, and it seemed as if the pursuers exerted\r\nthemselves to overtake the fugitives ere they could land.  In this,\r\nhowever, they failed.  The foremost canoe made for the beach close\r\nbeneath the rocks behind which we were concealed.  Their short paddles\r\nflashed like meteors in the water, and sent up a constant shower of\r\nspray.  The foam curled from the prow, and the eyes of the rowers\r\nglistened in their black faces as they strained every muscle of their\r\nnaked bodies.  Nor did they relax their efforts till the canoe struck\r\nthe beach with a violent shock; then, with a shout of defiance, the\r\nwhole party sprang, as if by magic, from the canoe to the shore.  Three\r\nwomen, two of whom carried infants in their arms, rushed into the woods;\r\nand the men crowded to the water's edge, with stones in their hands,\r\nspears levelled, and clubs brandished, to resist the landing of their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the two canoes had been about half-a-mile, and at\r\nthe great speed they were going, this was soon passed.  As the pursuers\r\nneared the shore, no sign of fear or hesitation was noticeable.  On they\r\ncame, like a wild charger--received, but recked not of, a shower of\r\nstones.  The canoe struck, and with a yell that seemed to issue from the\r\nthroats of incarnate fiends, they leaped into the water and drove their\r\nenemies up the beach.\r\n\r\nThe battle that immediately ensued was frightful to behold.  Most of the\r\nmen wielded clubs of enormous size and curious shapes, with which they\r\ndashed out each other's brains.  As they were almost entirely naked, and\r\nhad to bound, stoop, leap, and run in their terrible hand-to-hand\r\nencounters, they looked more like demons than human beings.  I felt my\r\nheart grow sick at the sight of this bloody battle, and would fain have\r\nturned away; but a species of fascination seemed to hold me down and\r\nglue my eyes upon the combatants.  I observed that the attacking party\r\nwas led by a most extraordinary being, who, from his size and\r\npeculiarity, I concluded was a chief.  His hair was frizzed out to an\r\nenormous extent, so that it resembled a large turban.  It was of a\r\nlight-yellow hue, which surprised me much, for the man's body was as\r\nblack as coal, and I felt convinced that the hair must have been dyed.\r\nHe was tattooed from head to foot; and his face, besides being tattooed,\r\nwas besmeared with red paint and streaked with white.  Altogether, with\r\nhis yellow turban-like hair, his Herculean black frame, his glittering\r\neyes, and white teeth, he seemed the most terrible monster I ever\r\nbeheld.  He was very active in the fight, and had already killed four\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the yellow-haired chief was attacked by a man quite as strong\r\nand large as himself.  He flourished a heavy club, something like an\r\neagle's beak at the point.  For a second or two these giants eyed each\r\nother warily, moving round and round, as if to catch each other at a\r\ndisadvantage; but seeing that nothing was to be gained by this caution,\r\nand that the loss of time might effectually turn the tide of battle\r\neither way, they apparently made up their minds to attack at the same\r\ninstant, for, with a wild shout and simultaneous spring, they swung\r\ntheir heavy clubs, which met with a loud report.  Suddenly the\r\nyellow-haired savage tripped, his enemy sprang forward, the ponderous\r\nclub was swung; but it did not descend, for at that moment the savage\r\nwas felled to the ground by a stone from the hand of one who had\r\nwitnessed his chief's danger.  This was the turning-point in the battle.\r\nThe savages who landed first turned and fled towards the bush on seeing\r\nthe fall of their chief.  But not one escaped; they were all overtaken\r\nand felled to the earth.  I saw, however, that they were not all killed.\r\nIndeed, their enemies, now that they were conquered, seemed anxious to\r\ntake them alive; and they succeeded in securing fifteen, whom they bound\r\nhand and foot with cords, and carrying them up into the woods, laid them\r\ndown among the bushes.  Here they left them, for what purpose I knew\r\nnot, and returned to the scene of the late battle, where the remnant of\r\nthe party were bathing their wounds.\r\n\r\nOut of the forty blacks that composed the attacking party only\r\ntwenty-eight remained alive, two of whom were sent into the bush to hunt\r\nfor the women and children.  Of the other party, as I have said, only\r\nfifteen survived, and these were lying bound and helpless on the grass.\r\n\r\nJack and Peterkin and I now looked at each other, and whispered our\r\nfears that the savages might clamber up the rocks to search for fresh\r\nwater, and so discover our place of concealment; but we were so much\r\ninterested in watching their movements that we agreed to remain where we\r\nwere--and indeed we could not easily have risen without exposing\r\nourselves to detection.  One of the savages now went up to the woods and\r\nsoon returned with a bundle of firewood, and we were not a little\r\nsurprised to see him set fire to it by the very same means used by Jack\r\nthe time we made our first fire--namely, with the bow and drill.  When\r\nthe fire was kindled, two of the party went again to the woods and\r\nreturned with one of the bound men.  A dreadful feeling of horror crept\r\nover my heart as the thought flashed upon me that they were going to\r\nburn their enemies.  As they bore him to the fire my feelings almost\r\noverpowered me.  I gasped for breath, and seizing my club, endeavoured\r\nto spring to my feet; but Jack's powerful arm pinned me to the earth.\r\nNext moment one of the savages raised his club and fractured the\r\nwretched creature's skull.  He must have died instantly; and, strange\r\nthough it may seem, I confess to a feeling of relief when the deed was\r\ndone, because I now knew that the poor savage could not be burned alive.\r\nScarcely had his limbs ceased to quiver when the monsters cut slices of\r\nflesh from his body, and after roasting them slightly over the fire,\r\ndevoured them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there arose a cry from the woods, and in a few seconds the two\r\nsavages hastened towards the fire, dragging the three women and their\r\ntwo infants along with them.  One of these women was much younger than\r\nher companions, and we were struck with the modesty of her demeanour and\r\nthe gentle expression of her face, which, although she had the flattish\r\nnose and thick lips of the others, was of a light-brown colour, and we\r\nconjectured that she must be of a different race.  She and her\r\ncompanions wore short petticoats, and a kind of tippet on their\r\nshoulders.  Their hair was jet black, but instead of being long, was\r\nshort and curly--though not woolly--somewhat like the hair of a young\r\nboy.  While we gazed with interest and some anxiety at these poor\r\ncreatures, the big chief advanced to one of the elder females and laid\r\nhis hand upon the child.  But the mother shrank from him, and clasping\r\nthe little one to her bosom, uttered a wail of fear.  With a savage\r\nlaugh, the chief tore the child from her arms and tossed it into the\r\nsea.  A low groan burst from Jack's lips as he witnessed this atrocious\r\nact and heard the mother's shriek as she fell insensible on the sand.\r\nThe rippling waves rolled the child on the beach, as if they refused to\r\nbe a party in such a foul murder, and we could observe that the little\r\none still lived.\r\n\r\nThe young girl was now brought forward, and the chief addressed her; but\r\nalthough we heard his voice and even the words distinctly, of course we\r\ncould not understand what he said.  The girl made no answer to his\r\nfierce questions, and we saw by the way in which he pointed to the fire\r\nthat he threatened her life.\r\n\r\n\"Peterkin,\" said Jack in a hoarse whisper, \"have you got your knife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Peterkin, whose face was pale as death.\r\n\r\n\"That will do.  Listen to me, and do my bidding quick.--Here is the\r\nsmall knife, Ralph.  Fly, both of you, through the bush, cut the cords\r\nthat bind the prisoners, and set them free!  There! quick, ere it be too\r\nlate!\"  Jack sprang up and seized a heavy but short bludgeon, while his\r\nstrong frame trembled with emotion, and large drops rolled down his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the man who had butchered the savage a few minutes before\r\nadvanced towards the girl with his heavy club.  Jack uttered a yell that\r\nrang like a death-shriek among the rocks.  With one bound he leaped over\r\na precipice full fifteen feet high, and before the savages had recovered\r\nfrom their surprise, was in the midst of them, while Peterkin and I\r\ndashed through the bushes towards the prisoners.  With one blow of his\r\nstaff Jack felled the man with the club; then turning round with a look\r\nof fury he rushed upon the big chief with the yellow hair.  Had the blow\r\nwhich Jack aimed at his head taken effect, the huge savage would have\r\nneeded no second stroke; but he was agile as a cat, and avoided it by\r\nspringing to one side, while at the same time he swung his ponderous\r\nclub at the head of his foe.  It was now Jack's turn to leap aside; and\r\nwell was it for him that the first outburst of his blind fury was over,\r\nelse he had become an easy prey to his gigantic antagonist.  But Jack\r\nwas cool now.  He darted his blows rapidly and well, and the superiority\r\nof his light weapon was strikingly proved in this combat; for while he\r\ncould easily evade the blows of the chief's heavy club, the chief could\r\nnot so easily evade those of his light one.  Nevertheless, so quick was\r\nhe, and so frightfully did he fling about the mighty weapon, that\r\nalthough Jack struck him almost every blow, the strokes had to be\r\ndelivered so quickly that they wanted force to be very effectual.\r\n\r\nIt was lucky for Jack that the other savages considered the success of\r\ntheir chief in this encounter to be so certain that they refrained from\r\ninterfering.  Had they doubted it, they would have probably ended the\r\nmatter at once by felling him.  But they contented themselves with\r\nawaiting the issue.\r\n\r\nThe force which the chief expended in wielding his club now began to be\r\napparent.  His movements became slower, his breath hissed through his\r\nclenched teeth, and the surprised savages drew nearer in order to render\r\nassistance.  Jack observed this movement.  He felt that his fate was\r\nsealed, and resolved to cast his life upon the next blow.  The chief's\r\nclub was again about to descend on his head.  He might have evaded it\r\neasily, but instead of doing so, he suddenly shortened his grasp of his\r\nown club, rushed in under the blow, struck his adversary right between\r\nthe eyes with all his force, and fell to the earth, crushed beneath the\r\nsenseless body of the chief.  A dozen clubs flew high in air, ready to\r\ndescend on the head of Jack; but they hesitated a moment, for the\r\nmassive body of the chief completely covered him.  That moment saved his\r\nlife.  Ere the savages could tear the chief's body away, seven of their\r\nnumber fell prostrate beneath the clubs of the prisoners whom Peterkin\r\nand I had set free, and two others fell under our own hand.  We could\r\nnever have accomplished this had not our enemies been so engrossed with\r\nthe fight between Jack and their chief that they had failed to observe\r\nus until we were upon them.  They still outnumbered our party by three;\r\nbut we were flushed with victory, while they were taken by surprise and\r\ndispirited by the fall of their chief.  Moreover, they were awestruck by\r\nthe sweeping fury of Jack, who seemed to have lost his senses\r\naltogether, and had no sooner shaken himself free of the chief's body\r\nthan he rushed into the midst of them, and in three blows equalised our\r\nnumbers.  Peterkin and I flew to the rescue, the savages followed us,\r\nand in less than ten minutes the whole of our opponents were knocked\r\ndown or made prisoners, bound hand and foot, and extended side by side\r\nupon the seashore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nINTERCOURSE WITH THE SAVAGES--CANNIBALISM PREVENTED--THE SLAIN ARE\r\nBURIED AND THE SURVIVORS DEPART, LEAVING US AGAIN ALONE ON OUR CORAL\r\nISLAND.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle was over, the savages crowded round us and gazed at us\r\nin surprise, while they continued to pour upon us a flood of questions,\r\nwhich, being wholly unintelligible, of course we could not answer.\r\nHowever, by way of putting an end to it, Jack took the chief (who had\r\nrecovered from the effects of his wound) by the hand and shook it\r\nwarmly.  No sooner did the blacks see that this was meant to express\r\ngood-will than they shook hands with us all round.  After this ceremony\r\nwas gone through Jack went up to the girl, who had never once moved from\r\nthe rock where she had been left, but had continued an eager spectator\r\nof all that had passed.  He made signs to her to follow him, and then,\r\ntaking the chief by the hand, was about to conduct him to the bower when\r\nhis eye fell on the poor infant which had been thrown into the sea and\r\nwas still lying on the shore.  Dropping the chief's hand he hastened\r\ntowards it, and, to his great joy, found it to be still alive.  We also\r\nfound that the mother was beginning to recover slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Here, get out o' the way,\" said Jack, pushing us aside as we stooped\r\nover the poor woman and endeavoured to restore her; \"I'll soon bring her\r\nround.\"  So saying, he placed the infant on her bosom and laid its warm\r\ncheek on hers.  The effect was wonderful.  The woman opened her eyes,\r\nfelt the child, looked at it, and with a cry of joy, clasped it in her\r\narms, at the same time endeavouring to rise--for the purpose,\r\napparently, of rushing into the woods.\r\n\r\n\"There, that's all right,\" said Jack, once more taking the chief by the\r\nhand.--\"Now, Ralph and Peterkin, make the women and these fellows follow\r\nme to the bower.  We'll entertain them as hospitably as we can.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the savages were all seated on the ground in front of\r\nthe bower, making a hearty meal off a cold roast pig, several ducks, and\r\na variety of cold fish, together with an unlimited supply of cocoa-nuts,\r\nbread-fruits, yams, taro, and plums--with all of which they seemed to be\r\nquite familiar and perfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we three, being thoroughly knocked up with our day's work,\r\ntook a good draught of cocoa-nut lemonade, and throwing ourselves on our\r\nbeds, fell fast asleep.  The savages, it seems, followed our example,\r\nand in half-an-hour the whole camp was buried in repose.\r\n\r\nHow long we slept I cannot tell; but this I know--that when we lay down\r\nthe sun was setting, and when we awoke it was high in the heavens.  I\r\nawoke Jack, who started up in surprise, being unable at first to\r\ncomprehend our situation.  \"Now, then,\" said he, springing up, \"let's\r\nsee after breakfast.--Hallo, Peterkin, lazy fellow! how long do you mean\r\nto lie there?\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin yawned heavily.  \"Well,\" said he, opening his eyes and looking\r\nup after some trouble, \"if it isn't to-morrow morning, and me thinking\r\nit was to-day all this time--Hallo, Venus! where did you come from?  You\r\nseem tolerably at home, anyhow.  Bah! might as well speak to the cat as\r\nto you--better, in fact, for it understands me, and you don't.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark was called forth by the sight of one of the elderly females,\r\nwho had seated herself on the rock in front of the bower, and having\r\nplaced her child at her feet, was busily engaged in devouring the\r\nremains of a roast pig.\r\n\r\nBy this time the natives outside were all astir, and breakfast in an\r\nadvanced state of preparation.  During the course of it we made sundry\r\nattempts to converse with the natives by signs, but without effect.  At\r\nlast we hit upon a plan of discovering their names.  Jack pointed to his\r\nbreast and said \"Jack\" very distinctly; then he pointed to Peterkin and\r\nto me, repeating our names at the same time.  Then he pointed to himself\r\nagain and said \"Jack,\" and laying his finger on the breast of the chief,\r\nlooked inquiringly into his face.  The chief instantly understood him,\r\nand said \"Tararo\" twice distinctly.  Jack repeated it after him, and the\r\nchief, nodding his head approvingly, said \"Chuck,\" on hearing which\r\nPeterkin exploded with laughter.  But Jack turned, and with a frown\r\nrebuked him, saying, \"I must look even more indignantly at you than I\r\nfeel, Peterkin, you rascal, for these fellows don't like to be laughed\r\nat.\"  Then turning towards the youngest of the women, who was seated at\r\nthe door of the bower, he pointed to her; whereupon the chief said\r\n\"Avatea,\" and pointing towards the sun, raised his finger slowly towards\r\nthe zenith, where it remained steadily for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n\"What can that mean, I wonder?\" said Jack, looking puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Peterkin, \"the chief means she is an angel come down to\r\nstay here for a while.  If so, she's an uncommonly black one!\"\r\n\r\nWe did not feel quite satisfied with this explanation, so Jack went up\r\nto her and said \"Avatea.\"  The woman smiled sadly and nodded her head,\r\nat the same time pointing to her breast and then to the sun in the same\r\nmanner as the chief had done.  We were much puzzled to know what this\r\ncould signify; but as there was no way of solving our difficulty, we\r\nwere obliged to rest content.\r\n\r\nJack now made signs to the natives to follow him, and taking up his axe,\r\nhe led them to the place where the battle had been fought.  Here we\r\nfound the prisoners, who had passed the night on the beach, having been\r\ntotally forgotten by us, as our minds had been full of our guests, and\r\nwere ultimately overcome by sleep.  They did not seem the worse for\r\ntheir exposure, however, as we judged by the hearty appetite with which\r\nthey devoured the breakfast that was soon after given to them.  Jack\r\nthen began to dig a hole in the sand, and after working a few seconds,\r\nhe pointed to it and to the dead bodies that lay exposed on the beach.\r\nThe natives immediately perceived what he wanted, and running for their\r\npaddles, dug a hole in the course of half-an-hour that was quite large\r\nenough to contain all the bodies of the slain.  When it was finished,\r\nthey tossed their dead enemies into it with so much indifference that we\r\nfelt assured they would not have put themselves to this trouble had we\r\nnot asked them to do so.  The body of the yellow-haired chief was the\r\nlast thrown in.  This wretched man would have recovered from the blow\r\nwith which Jack felled him, and indeed he did endeavour to rise during\r\nthe _melee_ that followed his fall; but one of his enemies, happening to\r\nnotice the action, dealt him a blow with his club that killed him on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nWhile they were about to throw the sand over this chief, one of the\r\nsavages stooped over him, and with a knife, made apparently of stone,\r\ncut a large slice of flesh from his thigh.  We knew at once that he\r\nintended to make use of this for food, and could not repress a cry of\r\nhorror and disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, you blackguard!\" cried Jack, starting up and seizing the\r\nman by the arm, \"pitch that into the hole.  Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nThe savage, of course, did not understand the command; but he perfectly\r\nunderstood the look of disgust with which Jack regarded the flesh, and\r\nhis fierce gaze as he pointed towards the hole.  Nevertheless, he did\r\nnot obey.  Jack instantly turned to Tararo and made signs to him to\r\nenforce obedience.  The chief seemed to understand the appeal; for he\r\nstepped forward, raised his club, and was on the point of dashing out\r\nthe brains of his offending subject when Jack sprang forward and caught\r\nhis uplifted arm.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, you blockhead!\" he shouted.  \"I don't want you to kill the man!\"\r\nHe then pointed again to the flesh and to the hole.  The chief uttered a\r\nfew words, which had the desired effect; for the man threw the flesh\r\ninto the hole, which was immediately filled up.  This man was of a\r\nmorose, sulky disposition, and during all the time he remained on the\r\nisland, regarded us--especially Jack--with a scowling visage.  His name,\r\nwe found, was Mahine.\r\n\r\nThe next three or four days were spent by the savages in mending their\r\ncanoe, which had been damaged by the violent shock it had sustained on\r\nstriking the shore.  This canoe was a very curious structure.  It was\r\nabout thirty feet long, and had a high, towering stern.  The timbers of\r\nwhich it was partly composed were fastened much in the same way as those\r\nof our little boat were put together; but the part that seemed most\r\ncurious to us was a sort of outrigger, or long plank, which was attached\r\nto the body of the canoe by means of two stout cross-beams.  These beams\r\nkept the plank parallel with the canoe, but not in contact with it, for\r\nit floated in the water with an open space between--thus forming a sort\r\nof double canoe.  This, we found, was intended to prevent the upsetting\r\nof the canoe, which was so narrow that it could not have maintained an\r\nupright position without the outrigger.  We could not help wondering\r\nboth at the ingenuity and the clumsiness of this contrivance.\r\n\r\nWhen the canoe was ready, we assisted the natives to carry the prisoners\r\ninto it, and helped them to load it with provisions and fruit.  Peterkin\r\nalso went to the plum-tree for the purpose of making a special onslaught\r\nupon the hogs, and killed no less than six of them.  These we baked and\r\npresented to our friends, on the day of their departure.  On that day\r\nTararo made a great many energetic signs to us, which, after much\r\nconsideration, we came to understand were proposals that we should go\r\naway with him to his island; but having no desire to do so, we shook our\r\nheads very decidedly.  However, we consoled him by presenting him with\r\nour rusty axe, which we thought we could spare, having the excellent one\r\nwhich had been so providentially washed ashore to us the day we were\r\nwrecked.  We also gave him a piece of wood with our names carved on it,\r\nand a piece of string to hang it round his neck as an ornament.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more we were all assembled on the beach.  Being unable\r\nto speak to the savages, we went through the ceremony of shaking hands,\r\nand expected they would depart; but before doing so, Tararo went up to\r\nJack and rubbed noses with him, after which he did the same with\r\nPeterkin and me!  Seeing that this was their mode of salutation, we\r\ndetermined to conform to their custom; so we rubbed noses heartily with\r\nthe whole party, women and all!  The only disagreeable part of the\r\nprocess was when we came to rub noses with Mahine; and Peterkin\r\nafterwards said that when he saw his wolfish eyes glaring so close to\r\nhis face, he felt much more inclined to _bang_ than to _rub_ his nose.\r\nAvatea was the last to take leave of us, and we experienced a feeling of\r\nreal sorrow when she approached to bid us farewell.  Besides her modest\r\nair and gentle manners, she was the only one of the party who exhibited\r\nthe smallest sign of regret at parting from us.  Going up to Jack, she\r\nput out her flat little nose to be rubbed, and thereafter paid the same\r\ncompliment to Peterkin and me.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the canoe was out of sight; and we, with an indefinable\r\nfeeling of sadness creeping round our hearts, were seated in silence\r\nbeneath the shadow of our bower, meditating on the wonderful events of\r\nthe last few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nSAGACIOUS AND MORAL REMARKS IN REGARD TO LIFE--A SAIL!--AN UNEXPECTED\r\nSALUTE--THE END OF THE BLACK CAT--A TERRIBLE DIVE--AN INCAUTIOUS\r\nPROCEEDING AND A FRIGHTFUL CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\nLife is a strange compound.  Peterkin used to say of it that it beat a\r\ndruggist's shop all to sticks; for whereas the first is a compound of\r\ngood and bad, the other is a horrible compound of all that is utterly\r\ndetestable.  And indeed the more I consider it, the more I am struck\r\nwith the strange mixture of good and evil that exists, not only in the\r\nmaterial earth, but in our own natures.  In our own Coral Island we had\r\nexperienced every variety of good that a bountiful Creator could heap on\r\nus.  Yet on the night of the storm we had seen how almost, in our case--\r\nand altogether, no doubt, in the case of others less fortunate--all this\r\ngood might be swept away for ever.  We had seen the rich fruit-trees\r\nwaving in the soft air, the tender herbs shooting upwards under the\r\nbenign influence of the bright sun; and the next day we had seen these\r\ngood and beautiful trees and plants uprooted by the hurricane, crushed\r\nand hurled to the ground in destructive devastation.  We had lived for\r\nmany months in a clime, for the most part, so beautiful that we had\r\noften wondered whether Adam and Eve had found Eden more sweet; and we\r\nhad seen the quiet solitudes of our paradise suddenly broken in upon by\r\nferocious savages, and the white sands stained with blood and strewed\r\nwith lifeless forms, yet among these cannibals we had seen many symptoms\r\nof a kindly nature.  I pondered these things much, and while I\r\nconsidered them there recurred to my memory those words which I had read\r\nin my Bible: \"The works of God are wonderful, and His ways past finding\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these poor savages had left us we used to hold long and frequent\r\nconversations about them, and I noticed that Peterkin's manner was now\r\nmuch altered.  He did not, indeed, jest less heartily than before, but\r\nhe did so less frequently; and often there was a tone of deep\r\nseriousness in his manner, if not in his words, which made him seem to\r\nJack and me as if he had grown two years older within a few days.  But\r\nindeed I was not surprised at this when I reflected on the awful\r\nrealities which we had witnessed so lately.  We could by no means shake\r\noff a tendency to gloom for several weeks afterwards; but as time wore\r\naway, our usual good spirits returned somewhat, and we began to think of\r\nthe visit of the savages with feelings akin to those with which we\r\nrecall a terrible dream.\r\n\r\nOne day we were all enjoying ourselves in the Water Garden preparatory\r\nto going on a fishing excursion, for Peterkin had kept us in such\r\nconstant supply of hogs that we had become quite tired of pork and\r\ndesired a change.  Peterkin was sunning himself on the ledge of rock,\r\nwhile we were creeping among the rocks below.  Happening to look up, I\r\nobserved Peterkin cutting the most extraordinary capers and making\r\nviolent gesticulations for us to come up; so I gave Jack a push and rose\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\"A sail! a sail--Ralph, look--Jack, away on the horizon there, just over\r\nthe entrance to the lagoon!\" cried Peterkin as we scrambled up the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n\"So it is--and a schooner, too!\" said Jack as he proceeded hastily to\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nOur hearts were thrown into a terrible flutter by this discovery, for if\r\nit should touch at our island, we had no doubt the captain would be\r\nhappy to give us a passage to some of the civilised islands, where we\r\ncould find a ship sailing for England or some other part of Europe.\r\nHome, with all its associations, rushed in upon my heart like a flood;\r\nand much though I loved the Coral Island and the bower which had now\r\nbeen our home so long, I felt that I could have quitted all at that\r\nmoment without a sigh.  With joyful anticipations we hastened to the\r\nhighest point of rock near our dwelling and awaited the arrival of the\r\nvessel, for we now perceived that she was making straight for the island\r\nunder a steady breeze.\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour she was close to the reef, where she rounded-to and\r\nbacked her topsails in order to survey the coast.  Seeing this, and\r\nfearing that they might not perceive us, we all three waved pieces of\r\ncocoa-nut cloth in the air, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing them\r\nbeginning to lower a boat and bustle about the decks as if they meant to\r\nland.  Suddenly a flag was run up to the peak, a little cloud of white\r\nsmoke rose from the schooner's side, and before we could guess their\r\nintentions, a cannon-shot came crashing through the bushes, carried away\r\nseveral cocoa-nut trees in its passage, and burst in atoms against the\r\ncliff a few yards below the spot on which we stood.\r\n\r\nWith feelings of terror we now observed that the flag at the schooner's\r\npeak was black, with a Death's-head and cross-bones upon it.  As we\r\ngazed at each other in blank amazement, the word \"pirate\" escaped our\r\nlips simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" cried Peterkin as we observed a boat shoot from\r\nthe vessel's side and make for the entrance of the reef.  \"If they take\r\nus off the island, it will either be to throw us overboard for sport or\r\nto make pirates of us.\"\r\n\r\nI did not reply, but looked at Jack, as being our only resource in this\r\nemergency.  He stood with folded arms, and his eyes fixed with a grave,\r\nanxious expression on the ground.  \"There is but one hope,\" said he,\r\nturning with a sad expression of countenance to Peterkin.  \"Perhaps,\r\nafter all, we may not have to resort to it.  If these villains are\r\nanxious to take us, they will soon overrun the whole island.  But come,\r\nfollow me.\"\r\n\r\nStopping abruptly in his speech, Jack bounded into the woods, and led us\r\nby a circuitous route to Spouting Cliff.  Here he halted, and advancing\r\ncautiously to the rocks, glanced over their edge.  We were soon by his\r\nside, and saw the boat, which was crowded with armed men, just touching\r\nthe shore.  In an instant the crew landed, formed line, and rushed up to\r\nour bower.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds we saw them hurrying back to the boat, one of them\r\nswinging the poor cat round his head by the tail.  On reaching the\r\nwater's edge he tossed it far into the sea, and joined his companions,\r\nwho appeared to be holding a hasty council.\r\n\r\n\"You see what we may expect,\" said Jack bitterly.  \"The man who will\r\nwantonly kill a poor brute for sport will think little of murdering a\r\nfellow-creature.  Now, boys, we have but one chance left--the Diamond\r\nCave.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Diamond Cave!\" cried Peterkin.  \"Then my chance is a poor one, for\r\nI could not dive into it if all the pirates on the Pacific were at my\r\nheels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but,\" said I, \"we will take you down, Peterkin, if you will only\r\ntrust us.\"\r\n\r\nAs I spoke, we observed the pirates scatter over the beach, and radiate,\r\nas if from a centre, towards the woods and along shore.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Peterkin,\" said Jack in a solemn tone, \"you must make up your mind\r\nto do it, or we must make up our minds to die in your company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh Jack, my dear friend!\" cried Peterkin, turning pale, \"leave me; I\r\ndon't believe they'll think it worth while to kill me.  Go, you and\r\nRalph, and dive into the cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will not I,\" answered Jack quietly, while he picked up a stout\r\ncudgel from the ground.--\"So now, Ralph, we must prepare to meet these\r\nfellows.  Their motto is `No quarter.'  If we can manage to floor those\r\ncoming in this direction, we may escape into the woods for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are five of them,\" said I; \"we have no chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then!\" cried Peterkin, starting up and grasping Jack convulsively\r\nby the arm; \"let us dive.  I will go.\"\r\n\r\nThose who are not naturally expert in the water know well the feelings\r\nof horror that overwhelm them, when in it, at the bare idea of being\r\nheld down even for a few seconds--that spasmodic, involuntary recoil\r\nfrom compulsory immersion which has no connection whatever with\r\ncowardice; and they will understand the amount of resolution that it\r\nrequired in Peterkin to allow himself to be dragged down to a depth of\r\nten feet, and then, through a narrow tunnel, into an almost pitch-dark\r\ncavern.  But there was no alternative.  The pirates had already caught\r\nsight of us, and were now within a short distance of the rocks.\r\n\r\nJack and I seized Peterkin by the arms.\r\n\r\n\"Now, keep quite still--no struggling,\" said Jack, \"or we are lost!\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin made no reply; but the stern gravity of his marble features,\r\nand the tension of his muscles, satisfied us that he had fully made up\r\nhis mind to go through with it.  Just as the pirates gained the foot of\r\nthe rocks, which hid us for a moment from their view, we bent over the\r\nsea and plunged down together, head foremost.  Peterkin behaved like a\r\nhero.  He floated passively between us like a log of wood, and we passed\r\nthe tunnel and rose into the cave in a shorter space of time than I had\r\never done it before.\r\n\r\nPeterkin drew a long, deep breath on reaching the surface, and in a few\r\nseconds we were all standing on the ledge of rock in safety.  Jack now\r\nsearched for the tinder and torch which always lay in the cave.  He soon\r\nfound them, and lighting the torch, revealed to Peterkin's wondering\r\ngaze the marvels of the place.  But we were too wet to waste much time\r\nin looking about us.  Our first care was to take off our clothes and\r\nwring them as dry as we could.  This done, we proceeded to examine into\r\nthe state of our larder, for, as Jack truly remarked, there was no\r\nknowing how long the pirates might remain on the island.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Peterkin, \"they may take it into their heads to stop\r\nhere altogether, and so we shall be buried alive in this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think, Peterkin, that it's the nearest thing to being drowned\r\nalive that you ever felt?\" said Jack with a smile.  \"But I have no fear\r\nof that.  These villains never stay long on shore.  The sea is their\r\nhome, so you may depend upon it that they won't stay more than a day or\r\ntwo at the furthest.\"\r\n\r\nWe now began to make arrangements for spending the night in the cavern.\r\nAt various periods Jack and I had conveyed cocoa-nuts and other fruits,\r\nbesides rolls of cocoa-nut cloth, to this submarine cave, partly for\r\namusement, and partly from a feeling that we might possibly be driven\r\none day to take shelter here from the savages.  Little did we imagine\r\nthat the first savages who would drive us into it would be white\r\nsavages--perhaps our own countrymen!  We found the cocoa-nuts in good\r\ncondition, and the cooked yams; but the bread-fruits were spoiled.  We\r\nalso found the cloth where we had left it, and on opening it out, there\r\nproved to be sufficient to make a bed--which was important, as the rock\r\nwas damp.  Having collected it all together, we spread out our bed,\r\nplaced our torch in the midst of us, and ate our supper.  It was indeed\r\na strange chamber to feast in; and we could not help remarking on the\r\ncold, ghastly appearance of the walls, and the black water at our side\r\nwith the thick darkness beyond, and the sullen sound of the drops that\r\nfell at long intervals from the roof of the cavern into the still water,\r\nand the strong contrast between all this and our bed and supper, which,\r\nwith our faces, were lit up with the deep-red flame of the torch.\r\n\r\nWe sat long over our meal, talking together in subdued voices, for we\r\ndid not like the dismal echoes that rang through the vault above when we\r\nhappened to raise them.  At last the faint light that came through the\r\nopening died away, warning us that it was night and time for rest.  We\r\ntherefore put out our torch and lay down to sleep.\r\n\r\nOn awaking, it was some time ere we could collect our faculties so as to\r\nremember where we were, and we were in much uncertainty as to whether it\r\nwas early or late.  We saw by the faint light that it was day, but could\r\nnot guess at the hour; so Jack proposed that he should dive out and\r\nreconnoitre.\r\n\r\n\"No, Jack,\" said I; \"do you rest here.  You've had enough to do during\r\nthe last few days.  Rest yourself now, and take care of Peterkin, while\r\nI go out to see what the pirates are about.  I'll be very careful not to\r\nexpose myself, and I'll bring you word again in a short time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Ralph,\" answered Jack; \"please yourself.  But don't be long.\r\nAnd if you'll take my advice, you'll go in your clothes; for I would\r\nlike to have some fresh cocoa-nuts, and climbing trees without clothes\r\nis uncomfortable--to say the least of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pirates will be sure to keep a sharp lookout,\" said Peterkin; \"so,\r\npray, be careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear,\" said I.  \"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" answered my comrades.\r\n\r\nAnd while the words were yet sounding in my ears, I plunged into the\r\nwater, and in a few seconds found myself in the open air.  On rising, I\r\nwas careful to come up gently and to breathe softly, while I kept close\r\nin beside the rocks; but as I observed no one near me, I crept slowly\r\nout and ascended the cliff, a step at a time, till I obtained a full\r\nview of the shore.  No pirates were to be seen--even their boat was\r\ngone; but as it was possible they might have hidden themselves, I did\r\nnot venture too boldly forward.  Then it occurred to me to look out to\r\nsea, when, to my surprise, I saw the pirate schooner sailing away almost\r\nhull down on the horizon!  On seeing this I uttered a shout of joy.\r\nThen my first impulse was to dive back to tell my companions the good\r\nnews; but I checked myself, and ran to the top of the cliff in order to\r\nmake sure that the vessel I saw was indeed the pirate schooner.  I\r\nlooked long and anxiously at her, and giving vent to a deep sigh of\r\nrelief, said aloud, \"Yes, there she goes; the villains have been balked\r\nof their prey this time at least!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so sure of that!\" said a deep voice at my side, while at the same\r\nmoment a heavy hand grasped my shoulder and held it as if in a vice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nI FALL INTO THE HANDS OF PIRATES--HOW THEY TREATED ME, AND WHAT I SAID\r\nTO THEM--THE RESULT OF THE WHOLE ENDING IN A MELANCHOLY SEPARATION AND\r\nIN A MOST UNEXPECTED GIFT.\r\n\r\nMy heart seemed to leap into my throat at the words; and turning round,\r\nI beheld a man of immense stature and fierce aspect regarding me with a\r\nsmile of contempt.  He was a white man--that is to say, he was a man of\r\nEuropean blood, though his face, from long exposure to the weather, was\r\ndeeply bronzed.  His dress was that of a common seaman, except that he\r\nhad on a Greek skull-cap, and wore a broad shawl of the richest silk\r\nround his waist.  In this shawl were placed two pairs of pistols and a\r\nheavy cutlass.  He wore a beard and moustache, which, like the locks on\r\nhis head, were short, curly, and sprinkled with grey hairs.\r\n\r\n\"So, youngster,\" he said with a sardonic smile, while I felt his grasp\r\ntighten on my shoulder, \"the villains have been balked of their prey,\r\nhave they?  We shall see--we shall see.  Now, you whelp, look yonder!\"\r\nAs he spoke, the pirate uttered a shrill whistle.  In a second or two it\r\nwas answered, and the pirate boat rowed round the point at the Water\r\nGarden and came rapidly towards us.  \"Now, go make a fire on that point;\r\nand hark'ee, youngster, if you try to run away I'll send a quick and\r\nsure messenger after you,\" and he pointed significantly at his pistols.\r\n\r\nI obeyed in silence; and as I happened to have the burning-glass in my\r\npocket, a fire was speedily kindled, and a thick smoke ascended into the\r\nair.  It had scarcely appeared for two minutes when the boom of a gun\r\nrolled over the sea, and looking up, I saw that the schooner was making\r\nfor the island again.  It now flashed across me that this was a ruse on\r\nthe part of the pirates, and that they had sent their vessel away,\r\nknowing that it would lead us to suppose that they had left altogether.\r\nBut there was no use of regret now.  I was completely in their power; so\r\nI stood helplessly beside the pirate, watching the crew of the boat as\r\nthey landed on the beach.  For an instant I contemplated rushing over\r\nthe cliff into the sea; but this, I saw, I could not now accomplish, as\r\nsome of the men were already between me and the water.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of jesting at the success of their scheme, as the\r\ncrew ascended the rocks and addressed the man who had captured me by the\r\ntitle of \"Captain\".  They were a ferocious set of men, with shaggy\r\nbeards and scowling brows.  All of them were armed with cutlasses and\r\npistols, and their costumes were, with trifling variations, similar to\r\nthat of the captain.  As I looked from one to the other, and observed\r\nthe low, scowling brows that never unbent even when the men laughed, and\r\nthe mean, rascally expression that sat on each face, I felt that my life\r\nhung by a hair.\r\n\r\n\"But where are the other cubs?\" cried one of the men with an oath that\r\nmade me shudder.  \"I'll swear to it there were three at least, if not\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear what he says, whelp: where are the other dogs?\" said the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"If you mean my companions,\" said I in a low voice, \"I won't tell you.\"\r\n\r\nA loud laugh burst from the crew at this answer.\r\n\r\nThe pirate captain looked at me in surprise.  Then drawing a pistol from\r\nhis belt, he cocked it and said, \"Now, youngster, listen to me.  I've no\r\ntime to waste here.  If you don't tell me all you know, I'll blow your\r\nbrains out!  Where are your comrades?\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant I hesitated, not knowing what to do in this extremity.\r\nSuddenly a thought occurred to me.\r\n\r\n\"Villain,\" said I, shaking my clenched fist in his face, \"to blow my\r\nbrains out would make short work of me, and be soon over; death by\r\ndrowning is as sure, and the agony prolonged.  Yet I tell you to your\r\nface, if you were to toss me over yonder cliff into the sea, I would not\r\ntell you where my companions are; and I dare you to try me!\"\r\n\r\nThe pirate captain grew white with rage as I spoke.  \"Say you so?\" cried\r\nhe, uttering a fierce oath.--\"Here, lads, take him by the legs and heave\r\nhim in--quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe men, who were utterly silenced with surprise at my audacity,\r\nadvanced and seized me; and as they carried me towards the cliff, I\r\ncongratulated myself not a little on the success of my scheme, for I\r\nknew that once in the water I should be safe, and could rejoin Jack and\r\nPeterkin in the cave.  But my hopes were suddenly blasted by the captain\r\ncrying out, \"Hold on, lads, hold on!  We'll give him a taste of the\r\nthumb-screws before throwing him to the sharks.  Away with him into the\r\nboat.  Look alive! the breeze is freshening.\"\r\n\r\nThe men instantly raised me shoulder-high, and hurrying down the rocks,\r\ntossed me into the bottom of the boat, where I lay for some time stunned\r\nwith the violence of my fall.\r\n\r\nOn recovering sufficiently to raise myself on my elbow, I perceived that\r\nwe were already outside the coral reef and close alongside the schooner,\r\nwhich was of small size and clipper-built.  I had only time to observe\r\nthis much when I received a severe kick on the side from one of the men,\r\nwho ordered me, in a rough voice, to jump aboard.  Rising hastily, I\r\nclambered up the side.  In a few minutes the boat was hoisted on deck,\r\nthe vessel's head put close to the wind, and the Coral Island dropped\r\nslowly astern as we beat up against a head sea.\r\n\r\nImmediately after coming aboard, the crew were too busily engaged in\r\nworking the ship and getting in the boat to attend to me; so I remained\r\nleaning against the bulwarks close to the gangway, watching their\r\noperations.  I was surprised to find that there were no guns or\r\ncarronades of any kind in the vessel, which had more the appearance of a\r\nfast-sailing trader than a pirate.  But I was struck with the neatness\r\nof everything.  The brass-work of the binnacle and about the tiller, as\r\nwell as the copper belaying-pins, were as brightly polished as if they\r\nhad just come from the foundry.  The decks were pure white and smooth.\r\nThe masts were clean-scraped and varnished, except at the cross-trees\r\nand truck, which were painted black.  The standing and running rigging\r\nwas in the most perfect order, and the sails white as snow.  In short,\r\neverything, from the single narrow red stripe on her low, black hull to\r\nthe trucks on her tapering masts, evinced an amount of care and strict\r\ndiscipline that would have done credit to a ship of the Royal Navy.\r\nThere was nothing lumbering or unseemly about the vessel, excepting,\r\nperhaps, a boat, which lay on the deck with its keel up between the fore\r\nand main masts.  It seemed disproportionately large for the schooner;\r\nbut when I saw that the crew amounted to between thirty and forty men, I\r\nconcluded that this boat was held in reserve in case of any accident\r\ncompelling the crew to desert the vessel.\r\n\r\nAs I have before said, the costumes of the men were similar to that of\r\nthe captain.  But in head-gear they differed, not only from him, but\r\nfrom each other--some wearing the ordinary straw hat of the merchant\r\nservice, while others wore cloth caps and red worsted nightcaps.  I\r\nobserved that all their arms were sent below, the captain only retaining\r\nhis cutlass and a single pistol in the folds of his shawl.  Although the\r\ncaptain was the tallest and most powerful man in the ship, he did not\r\nstrikingly excel many of his men in this respect; and the only\r\ndifference that an ordinary observer would have noticed was a certain\r\ndegree of open candour, straightforward daring, in the bold, ferocious\r\nexpression of his face, which rendered him less repulsive than his\r\nlow-browed associates, but did not by any means induce the belief that\r\nhe was a hero.  This look was, however, the indication of that spirit\r\nwhich gave him the pre-eminence among the crew of desperadoes who called\r\nhim captain.  He was a lion-like villain, totally devoid of personal\r\nfear, and utterly reckless of consequences, and therefore a terror to\r\nhis men, who individually hated him, but unitedly felt it to be to their\r\nadvantage to have him at their head.\r\n\r\nBut my thoughts soon reverted to the dear companions whom I had left on\r\nshore; and as I turned towards the Coral Island, which was now far away\r\nto leeward, I sighed deeply, and the tears rolled slowly down my cheeks\r\nas I thought that I might never see them more.\r\n\r\n\"So you're blubbering, are you, you obstinate whelp?\" said the deep\r\nvoice of the captain as he came up and gave me a box on the ear that\r\nnearly felled me to the deck.  \"I don't allow any such weakness aboard\r\no' this ship.  So clap a stopper on your eyes, or I'll give you\r\nsomething to cry for.\"\r\n\r\nI flushed with indignation at this rough and cruel treatment, but felt\r\nthat giving way to anger would only make matters worse; so I made no\r\nreply, but took out my handkerchief and dried my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were made of better stuff,\" continued the captain\r\nangrily.  \"I'd rather have a mad bulldog aboard than a water-eyed puppy.\r\nBut I'll cure you, lad, or introduce you to the sharks before long.\r\nNow go below, and stay there till I call you.\"\r\n\r\nAs I walked forward to obey, my eye fell on a small keg standing by the\r\nside of the mainmast, on which the word _gunpowder_ was written in\r\npencil.  It immediately flashed across me that as we were beating up\r\nagainst the wind, anything floating in the sea would be driven on the\r\nreef encircling the Coral Island.  I also recollected--for thought is\r\nmore rapid than the lightning--that my old companions had a pistol.\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation, therefore, I lifted the keg from the deck\r\nand tossed it into the sea!  An exclamation of surprise burst from the\r\ncaptain and some of the men who witnessed this act of mine.\r\n\r\nStriding up to me, and uttering fearful imprecations, the captain raised\r\nhis hand to strike me, while he shouted, \"Boy! whelp! what mean you by\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you lower your hand,\" said I in a loud voice, while I felt the blood\r\nrush to my temples, \"I'll tell you.  Until you do so, I'm dumb.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain stepped back and regarded me with a look of amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued I, \"I threw that keg into the sea because the wind and\r\nwaves will carry it to my friends on the Coral Island, who happen to\r\nhave a pistol but no powder.  I hope that it will reach them soon; and\r\nmy only regret is that the keg was not a bigger one.  Moreover, pirate,\r\nyou said just now that you thought I was made of better stuff.  I don't\r\nknow what stuff I am made of--I never thought much about that subject;\r\nbut I'm quite certain of this--that I am made of such stuff as the like\r\nof you shall never tame, though you should do your worst!\"\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, the captain, instead of flying into a rage, smiled, and\r\nthrusting his hand into the voluminous shawl that encircled his waist,\r\nturned on his heel and walked aft, while I went below.\r\n\r\nHere, instead of being rudely handled, as I had expected, the men\r\nreceived me with a shout of laughter; and one of them, patting me on the\r\nback, said, \"Well done, lad!  You're a brick, and I have no doubt will\r\nturn out a rare cove.  Bloody Bill there was just such a fellow as you\r\nare, and he's now the biggest cut-throat of us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a can of beer, lad,\" cried another, \"and wet your whistle after\r\nthat speech o' your'n to the captain.  If any one o' us had made it,\r\nyoungster, he would have had no whistle to wet by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop your clapper, Jack!\" vociferated a third.  \"Give the boy a junk o'\r\nmeat.  Don't you see he's a'most goin' to kick the bucket?\"\r\n\r\n\"And no wonder,\" said the first speaker with an oath, \"after the tumble\r\nyou gave him into the boat!  I guess it would have broke your neck if\r\nyou had got it.\"\r\n\r\nI did indeed feel somewhat faint, which was owing, doubtless, to the\r\ncombined effects of ill-usage and hunger; for it will be recollected\r\nthat I had dived out of the cave that morning before breakfast, and it\r\nwas now near midday.  I therefore gladly accepted a plate of boiled pork\r\nand a yam, which were handed to me by one of the men from the locker on\r\nwhich some of the crew were seated eating their dinner.  But I must add\r\nthat the zest with which I ate my meal was much abated in consequence of\r\nthe frightful oaths and the terrible language that flowed from the lips\r\nof these godless men, even in the midst of their hilarity and\r\ngood-humour.  The man who had been alluded to as Bloody Bill was seated\r\nnear me, and I could not help wondering at the moody silence he\r\nmaintained among his comrades.  He did indeed reply to their questions\r\nin a careless, off-hand tone, but he never volunteered a remark.  The\r\nonly difference between him and the others was his taciturnity and his\r\nsize, for he was nearly, if not quite, as large a man as the captain.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the afternoon I was left to my own reflections,\r\nwhich were anything but agreeable; for I could not banish from my mind\r\nthe threat about the thumbscrews, of the nature and use of which I had a\r\nvague but terrible conception.  I was still meditating on my unhappy\r\nfate when, just after nightfall, one of the watch on deck called down\r\nthe hatchway:\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, there!  One o' you tumble up and light the cabin lamp, and send\r\nthat boy aft to the captain--sharp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, do you hear, youngster? the captain wants you.  Look alive!\"\r\nsaid Bloody Bill, raising his huge frame from the locker on which he had\r\nbeen asleep for the last two hours.  He sprang up the ladder, and I\r\ninstantly followed him, and going aft, was shown into the cabin by one\r\nof the men, who closed the door after me.\r\n\r\nA small silver lamp which hung from a beam threw a dim, soft light over\r\nthe cabin, which was a small apartment, and comfortably but plainly\r\nfurnished.  Seated on a camp-stool at the table, and busily engaged in\r\nexamining a chart of the Pacific, was the captain, who looked up as I\r\nentered, and in a quiet voice bade me be seated, while he threw down his\r\npencil, and rising from the table, stretched himself on a sofa at the\r\nupper end of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Boy,\" said he, looking me full in the face, \"what is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ralph Rover,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you come from, and how came you to be on that island?  How\r\nmany companions had you on it?  Answer me, now, and mind you tell no\r\nlies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never tell lies,\" said I firmly.\r\n\r\nThe captain received this reply with a cold, sarcastic smile, and bade\r\nme answer his questions.\r\n\r\nI then told him the history of myself and my companions from the time we\r\nsailed till the day of his visit to the island--taking care, however, to\r\nmake no mention of the Diamond Cave.  After I had concluded, he was\r\nsilent for a few minutes; then looking up, he said, \"Boy, I believe\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nI was surprised at this remark, for I could not imagine why he should\r\nnot believe me.  However, I made no reply.\r\n\r\n\"And what,\" continued the captain, \"makes you think that this schooner\r\nis a pirate?\"\r\n\r\n\"The black flag,\" said I, \"showed me what you are; and if any further\r\nproof were wanting, I have had it in the brutal treatment I have\r\nreceived at your hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain frowned as I spoke; but, subduing his anger, he continued,\r\n\"Boy, you are too bold.  I admit that we treated you roughly, but that\r\nwas because you made us lose time and gave us a good deal of trouble.\r\nAs to the black flag, that is merely a joke that my fellows play off\r\nupon people sometimes in order to frighten them.  It is their humour,\r\nand does no harm.  I am no pirate, boy, but a lawful trader--a rough\r\none, I grant you; but one can't help that in these seas, where there are\r\nso many pirates on the water and such murderous blackguards on the land.\r\nI carry on a trade in sandal-wood with the Feejee Islands; and if you\r\nchoose, Ralph, to behave yourself and be a good boy, I'll take you along\r\nwith me and give you a good share of the profits.  You see, I'm in want\r\nof an honest boy like you to look after the cabin, and keep the log, and\r\nsuperintend the traffic on shore sometimes.  What say you, Ralph: would\r\nyou like to become a sandal-wood trader?\"\r\n\r\nI was much surprised by this explanation, and a good deal relieved to\r\nfind that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; but instead of\r\nreplying, I said, \"If it be as you state, then why did you take me from\r\nmy island, and why do you not now take me back?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain smiled as he replied, \"I took you off in anger, boy, and I'm\r\nsorry for it.  I would even now take you back, but we are too far away\r\nfrom it.  See, there it is,\" he added, laying his finger on the chart;\r\n\"and we are now here--fifty miles, at least.  It would not be fair to my\r\nmen to put about now, for they have all an interest in the trade.\"\r\n\r\nI could make no reply to this; so, after a little more conversation, I\r\nagreed to become one of the crew--at least, until we could reach some\r\ncivilised island where I might be put ashore.  The captain assented to\r\nthis proposition; and after thanking him for the promise, I left the\r\ncabin and went on deck with feelings that ought to have been lighter,\r\nbut which were, I could not tell why, marvellously heavy and\r\nuncomfortable still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nBLOODY BILL--DARK SURMISES--A STRANGE SAIL, AND A STRANGE CREW, AND A\r\nSTILL STRANGER CARGO--NEW REASONS FOR FAVOURING MISSIONARIES--A\r\nMURDEROUS MASSACRE, AND THOUGHTS THEREON.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after the conversation narrated in the last chapter I was\r\nstanding on the quarter-deck of the schooner, watching the gambols of a\r\nshoal of porpoises that swam round us.  It was a dead calm--one of those\r\nstill, hot, sweltering days so common in the Pacific, when nature seems\r\nto have gone to sleep, and the only thing in water or in air that proves\r\nher still alive is her long, deep breathing in the swell of the mighty\r\nsea.  No cloud floated in the deep blue above, no ripple broke the\r\nreflected blue below.  The sun shone fiercely in the sky, and a ball of\r\nfire blazed with almost equal power from out the bosom of the water.  So\r\nintensely still was it, and so perfectly transparent was the surface of\r\nthe deep, that had it not been for the long swell already alluded to, we\r\nmight have believed the surrounding universe to be a huge, blue, liquid\r\nball, and our little ship the one solitary material speck in all\r\ncreation floating in the midst of it.\r\n\r\nNo sound broke on our ears save the soft puff now and then of a\r\nporpoise, the slow creak of the masts as we swayed gently on the swell,\r\nthe patter of the reef-points, and the occasional flap of the hanging\r\nsails.  An awning covered the fore and after parts of the schooner,\r\nunder which the men composing the watch on deck lolled in sleepy\r\nindolence, overcome with excessive heat.  Bloody Bill, as the men\r\ninvariably called him, was standing at the tiller; but his post for the\r\npresent was a sinecure, and he whiled away the time by alternately\r\ngazing in dreamy abstraction at the compass in the binnacle and by\r\nwalking to the taffrail in order to spit into the sea.  In one of these\r\nturns he came near to where I was standing, and leaning over the side,\r\nlooked long and earnestly down into the blue wave.\r\n\r\nThis man, although he was always taciturn and often surly, was the only\r\nhuman being on board with whom I had the slightest desire to become\r\nbetter acquainted.  The other men, seeing that I did not relish their\r\ncompany, and knowing that I was a protege of the captain, treated me\r\nwith total indifference.  Bloody Bill, it is true, did the same; but as\r\nthis was his conduct to every one else, it was not peculiar in reference\r\nto me.  Once or twice I tried to draw him into conversation, but he\r\nalways turned away after a few cold monosyllables.  As he now leaned\r\nover the taffrail, close beside me, I said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Bill, why is it that you are so gloomy?  Why do you never speak to any\r\none?\"\r\n\r\nBill smiled slightly as he replied, \"Why, I s'pose it's because I hain't\r\ngot nothin' to say!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's strange,\" said I musingly.  \"You look like a man that could\r\nthink, and such men can usually speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"So they can, youngster,\" rejoined Bill somewhat sternly; \"and I could\r\nspeak too if I had a mind to, but what's the use o' speakin' here?  The\r\nmen only open their mouths to curse and swear, and they seem to find it\r\nentertainin'; but I don't, so I hold my tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bill, that's true, and I would rather not hear you speak at all\r\nthan hear you speak like the other men.  But I don't swear, Bill; so you\r\nmight talk to me sometimes, I think.  Besides, I'm weary of spending day\r\nafter day in this way, without a single soul to say a pleasant word to.\r\nI've been used to friendly conversation, Bill, and I really would take\r\nit kind if you would talk with me a little now and then.\"\r\n\r\nBill looked at me in surprise, and I thought I observed a sad expression\r\npass across his sunburned face.\r\n\r\n\"An' where have you been used to friendly conversation?\" said Bill,\r\nlooking down again into the sea.  \"Not on that Coral Island, I take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said I energetically.  \"I have spent many of the happiest\r\nmonths in my life on that Coral Island;\" and without waiting to be\r\nfurther questioned, I launched out into a glowing account of the happy\r\nlife that Jack and Peterkin and I had spent together, and related\r\nminutely every circumstance that befell us while on the island.\r\n\r\n\"Boy, boy,\" said Bill in a voice so deep that it startled me, \"this is\r\nno place for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said I.  \"I am of little use on board, and I don't like\r\nmy comrades; but I can't help it, and at any rate I hope to be free\r\nagain soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free?\" said Bill, looking at me in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, free,\" returned I.  \"The captain said he would put me ashore after\r\nthis trip was over.\"\r\n\r\n\"_This trip_!  Hark'ee, boy,\" said Bill, lowering his voice, \"what said\r\nthe captain to you the day you came aboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that he was a trader in sandal-wood, and no pirate, and told me\r\nthat if I would join him for this trip he would give me a good share of\r\nthe profits, or put me on shore in some civilised island if I chose.\"\r\n\r\nBill's brows lowered savagely as he muttered, \"Ay, he said truth when he\r\ntold you he was a sandal-wood trader, but he lied when--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sail ho!\" shouted the lookout at the masthead.\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" cried Bill, springing to the tiller; while the men,\r\nstartled by the sudden cry, jumped up and gazed round the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"On the starboard quarter, hull down, sir,\" answered the lookout.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the captain came on deck, and mounting into the rigging,\r\nsurveyed the sail through the glass.  Then sweeping his eye round the\r\nhorizon, he gazed steadily at the particular point.\r\n\r\n\"Take in topsails!\" shouted the captain, swinging himself down on the\r\ndeck by the main-back stay.\r\n\r\n\"Take in topsails!\" roared the first mate.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir-r-r!\" answered the men as they sprang into the rigging and\r\nwent aloft like cats.\r\n\r\nInstantly all was bustle on board the hitherto quiet schooner.  The\r\ntopsails were taken in and stowed, the men stood by the sheets and\r\nhalyards, and the captain gazed anxiously at the breeze, which was now\r\nrushing towards us like a sheet of dark blue.  In a few seconds it\r\nstruck us.  The schooner trembled, as if in surprise at the sudden\r\nonset, while she fell away; then, bending gracefully to the wind, as\r\nthough in acknowledgment of her subjection, she cut through the waves\r\nwith her sharp prow like a dolphin, while Bill directed her course\r\ntowards the strange sail.\r\n\r\nIn half-an-hour we neared her sufficiently to make out that she was a\r\nschooner, and from the clumsy appearance of her masts and sails we\r\njudged her to be a trader.  She evidently did not like our appearance,\r\nfor the instant the breeze reached her she crowded all sail and showed\r\nus her stern.  As the breeze had moderated a little, our topsails were\r\nagain shaken out; and it soon became evident--despite the proverb, \"A\r\nstern chase is a long one\"--that we doubled her speed, and would\r\noverhaul her speedily.  When within a mile we hoisted British colours,\r\nbut receiving no acknowledgment, the captain ordered a shot to be fired\r\nacross her bows.  In a moment, to my surprise, a large portion of the\r\nbottom of the boat amidships was removed, and in the hole thus exposed\r\nappeared an immense brass gun.  It worked on a swivel, and was elevated\r\nby means of machinery.  It was quickly loaded and fired.  The heavy ball\r\nstruck the water a few yards ahead of the chase, and ricochetting into\r\nthe air, plunged into the sea a mile beyond it.\r\n\r\nThis produced the desired effect.  The strange vessel backed her\r\ntopsails and hove-to, while we ranged up and lay-to about a hundred\r\nyards off.\r\n\r\n\"Lower the boat!\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\nIn a second the boat was lowered and manned by a part of the crew, who\r\nwere all armed with cutlasses and pistols.  As the captain passed me to\r\nget into it he said, \"Jump into the stern-sheets, Ralph; I may want\r\nyou.\"  I obeyed, and in ten minutes more we were standing on the\r\nstranger's deck.  We were all much surprised at the sight that met our\r\neyes.  Instead of a crew of such sailors as we were accustomed to see,\r\nthere were only fifteen blacks, standing on the quarter-deck, and\r\nregarding us with looks of undisguised alarm.  They were totally\r\nunarmed, and most of them unclothed.  One or two, however, wore portions\r\nof European attire.  One had on a pair of duck trousers, which were much\r\ntoo large for him, and stuck out in a most ungainly manner; another wore\r\nnothing but the common, scanty, native garment round the loins and a\r\nblack beaver hat; but the most ludicrous personage of all, and one who\r\nseemed to be chief, was a tall, middle-aged man, of a mild, simple\r\nexpression of countenance, who wore a white cotton shirt, a\r\nswallow-tailed coat, and a straw hat, while his black, brawny legs were\r\ntotally uncovered below the knees.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the commander of this ship?\" inquired our captain, stepping up\r\nto this individual.\r\n\r\n\"I is cap'in,\" he answered, taking off his straw hat and making a low\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" said our captain in surprise.  \"Where do you come from, and where\r\nare you bound?  What cargo have you aboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"We is come,\" answered the man with the swallow-tail, \"from Aitutaki; we\r\nwas go for Rarotonga.  We is native miss'nary ship; our name is de\r\n_Olive Branch_; an' our cargo is two tons cocoa-nuts, seventy pigs,\r\ntwenty cats, and de Gosp'l.\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement was received by the crew of our vessel with a shout of\r\nlaughter, which, however, was peremptorily checked by the captain, whose\r\nexpression instantly changed from one of severity to that of frank\r\nurbanity as he advanced towards the missionary and shook him warmly by\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to have fallen in with you,\" said he, \"and I wish you\r\nmuch success in your missionary labours.  Pray take me to your cabin, as\r\nI wish to converse with you privately.\"\r\n\r\nThe missionary immediately took him by the hand, and as he led him away\r\nI heard him saying, \"me most glad to find you trader; we t'ought you be\r\npirate.  You very like one 'bout the masts.\"\r\n\r\nWhat conversation the captain had with this man I never heard; but he\r\ncame on deck again in a quarter of an hour, and shaking hands cordially\r\nwith the missionary, ordered us into our boat and returned to the\r\nschooner, which was immediately put before the wind.  In a few minutes\r\nthe _Olive Branch_ was left far behind us.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, as I was down below at dinner, I heard the men talking\r\nabout this curious ship.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said one, \"why our captain looked so sweet on yon\r\nswallow-tailed supercargo o' pigs and Gospels?  If it had been an\r\nordinary trader, now, he would have taken as many o' the pigs as he\r\nrequired and sent the ship with all on board to the bottom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Dick, you must be new to these seas if you don't know that!\" cried\r\nanother.  \"The captain cares as much for the Gospel as you do (an'\r\nthat's precious little); but he knows, and everybody knows, that the\r\nonly place among the southern islands where a ship can put in and get\r\nwhat she wants in comfort is where the Gospel has been sent to.  There\r\nare hundreds o' islands, at this blessed moment, where you might as well\r\njump straight into a shark's maw as land without a band o' thirty\r\ncomrades armed to the teeth to back you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said a man with a deep scar over his right eye.  \"Dick's new to\r\nthe work.  But if the captain takes us for a cargo o' sandal-wood to the\r\nFeejees, he'll get a taste o' these black gentry in their native\r\ncondition.  For my part, I don't know, and I don't care, what the Gospel\r\ndoes to them; but I know that when any o' the islands chance to get it,\r\ntrade goes all smooth and easy.  But where they ha'n't got it, Beelzebub\r\nhimself could hardly desire better company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you ought to be a good judge,\" cried another, laughing, \"for\r\nyou've never kept any company but the worst all your life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ralph Rover!\" shouted a voice down the hatchway; \"captain wants you,\r\naft.\"\r\n\r\nSpringing up the ladder, I hastened to the cabin, pondering as I went\r\nthe strange testimony borne by these men to the effect of the Gospel on\r\nsavage natures--testimony which, as it was perfectly disinterested, I\r\nhad no doubt whatever was strictly true.\r\n\r\nOn coming again on deck I found Bloody Bill at the helm, and as we were\r\nalone together, I tried to draw him into conversation.  After repeating\r\nto him the conversation in the forecastle about the missionaries, I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Bill: is this schooner really a trader in sandal-wood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Ralph, she is; but she's just as really a pirate.  The black flag\r\nyou saw flying at the peak was no deception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how can you say she's a trader?\" asked I.\r\n\r\n\"Why, as to that, she trades when she can't take by force; but she takes\r\nby force when she can, in preference.  Ralph,\" he added, lowering his\r\nvoice, \"if you had seen the bloody deeds that I have witnessed done on\r\nthese decks, you would not need to ask if we were pirates.  But you'll\r\nfind it out soon enough.  As for the missionaries, the captain favours\r\nthem because they are useful to him.  The South Sea Islanders are such\r\nincarnate fiends that they are the better of being tamed, and the\r\nmissionaries are the only men who can do it.\"\r\n\r\nOur track after this lay through several clusters of small islets, among\r\nwhich we were becalmed more than once.  During this part of our voyage\r\nthe watch on deck and the lookout at the masthead were more than usually\r\nvigilant, as we were not only in danger of being attacked by the natives\r\n(who, I learned from the captain's remarks, were a bloody and deceitful\r\ntribe at this group), but we were also exposed to much risk from the\r\nmultitudes of coral reefs that rose up in the channels between the\r\nislands--some of them just above the surface, others a few feet below\r\nit.  Our precautions against the savages, I found, were indeed\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne day we were becalmed among a group of small islands, most of which\r\nappeared to be uninhabited.  As we were in want of fresh water, the\r\ncaptain sent the boat ashore to bring off a cask or two.  But we were\r\nmistaken in thinking there were no natives; for scarcely had we drawn\r\nnear to the shore when a band of naked blacks rushed out of the bush and\r\nassembled on the beach, brandishing their clubs and spears in a\r\nthreatening manner.  Our men were well armed, but refrained from showing\r\nany signs of hostility, and rowed nearer in order to converse with the\r\nnatives; and I now found that more than one of the crew could\r\nimperfectly speak dialects of the language peculiar to the South Sea\r\nIslanders.  When within forty yards of the shore we ceased rowing, and\r\nthe first mate stood up to address the multitude; but instead of\r\nanswering us, they replied with a shower of stones, some of which cut\r\nthe men severely.  Instantly our muskets were levelled, and a volley was\r\nabout to be fired when the captain hailed us in a loud voice from the\r\nschooner, which lay not more than five or six hundred yards off the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fire!\" he shouted angrily.  \"Pull off to the point ahead of you!\"\r\n\r\nThe men looked surprised at this order, and uttered deep curses as they\r\nprepared to obey; for their wrath was roused, and they burned for\r\nrevenge.  Three or four of them hesitated, and seemed disposed to\r\nmutiny.\r\n\r\n\"Don't distress yourselves, lads,\" said the mate, while a bitter smile\r\ncurled his lip.  \"Obey orders.  The captain's not the man to take an\r\ninsult tamely.  If Long Tom does not speak presently, I'll give myself\r\nto the sharks.\"\r\n\r\nThe men smiled significantly as they pulled from the shore, which was\r\nnow crowded with a dense mass of savages, amounting probably to five or\r\nsix hundred.  We had not rowed off above a couple of hundred yards when\r\na loud roar thundered over the sea, and the big brass gun sent a\r\nwithering shower of grape point-blank into the midst of the living mass,\r\nthrough which a wide lane was cut; while a yell, the like of which I\r\ncould not have imagined, burst from the miserable survivors as they fled\r\nto the woods.  Amongst the heaps of dead that lay on the sand just where\r\nthey had fallen, I could distinguish mutilated forms writhing in agony;\r\nwhile ever and anon one and another rose convulsively from out the mass,\r\nendeavoured to stagger towards the wood, and ere they had taken a few\r\nsteps, fell and wallowed on the bloody sand.  My blood curdled within me\r\nas I witnessed this frightful and wanton slaughter; but I had little\r\ntime to think, for the captain's deep voice came again over the water\r\ntowards us: \"Pull ashore, lads, and fill your water-casks!\"  The men\r\nobeyed in silence, and it seemed to me as if even their hard hearts were\r\nshocked by the ruthless deed.  On gaining the mouth of the rivulet at\r\nwhich we intended to take in water, we found it flowing with blood; for\r\nthe greater part of those who were slain had been standing on the banks\r\nof the stream, a short way above its mouth.  Many of the wretched\r\ncreatures had fallen into it; and we found one body, which had been\r\ncarried down, jammed between two rocks, with the staring eyeballs turned\r\ntowards us, and his black hair waving in the ripples of the blood-red\r\nstream.  No one dared to oppose our landing now, so we carried our casks\r\nto a pool above the murdered group, and having filled them, returned on\r\nboard.  Fortunately a breeze sprang up soon afterwards, and carried us\r\naway from the dreadful spot; but it could not waft me away from the\r\nmemory of what I had seen.\r\n\r\n\"And this,\" thought I, gazing in horror at the captain, who, with a\r\nquiet look of indifference, leaned upon the taffrail, smoking a cigar\r\nand contemplating the fertile green islets as they passed like a lovely\r\npicture before our eyes--\"this is the man who favours the missionaries\r\nbecause they are useful to him and can tame the savages better than any\r\none else can do it!\"  Then I wondered in my mind whether it were\r\npossible for any missionary to tame _him_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nBLOODY BILL IS COMMUNICATIVE AND SAGACIOUS--UNPLEASANT PROSPECTS--\r\nRETROSPECTIVE MEDITATIONS INTERRUPTED BY VOLCANIC AGENCY--THE PIRATES\r\nNEGOTIATE WITH A FEEJEE CHIEF--VARIOUS ETCETERAS THAT ARE CALCULATED TO\r\nSURPRISE AND HORRIFY.\r\n\r\nIt was many days after the events just narrated ere I recovered a little\r\nof my wonted spirits.  I could not shake off the feeling for a long time\r\nthat I was in a frightful dream, and the sight of our captain filled me\r\nwith so much horror that I kept out of his way as much as my duties\r\nabout the cabin would permit.  Fortunately he took so little notice of\r\nme that he did not observe my changed feelings towards him, otherwise it\r\nmight have been worse for me.\r\n\r\nBut I was now resolved that I would run away the very first island we\r\nshould land at, and commit myself to the hospitality of the natives\r\nrather than remain an hour longer than I could help in the pirate\r\nschooner.  I pondered this subject a good deal, and at last made up my\r\nmind to communicate my intention to Bloody Bill; for during several\r\ntalks I had had with him of late, I felt assured that he too would\r\nwillingly escape if possible.  When I told him of my design he shook his\r\nhead.  \"No, no, Ralph,\" said he; \"you must not think of running away\r\nhere.  Among some of the groups of islands you might do so with safety;\r\nbut if you tried it here, you would find that you had jumped out of the\r\nfryin'-pan into the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, Bill?\" said I.  \"Would the natives not receive me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That they would, lad; but they would eat you too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat me!\" said I in surprise.  \"I thought the South Sea Islanders never\r\nate anybody except their enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Bill.  \"I 'spose 'twas yer tender-hearted friends in\r\nEngland that put that notion into your head.  There's a set o'\r\nsoft-hearted folk at home that I knows on who don't like to have their\r\nfeelin's ruffled; and when you tell them anything they don't like--that\r\nshocks them, as they call it--no matter how true it be, they stop their\r\nears and cry out, `Oh, that is _too_ horrible!  We can't believe that!'\r\nAn' they say truth.  They can't believe it, 'cause they won't believe\r\nit.  Now, I believe there's thousands o' the people in England who are\r\nsich born drivellin' _won't believers_ that they think the black fellows\r\nhereaways, at the worst, eat an enemy only now an' then out o' spite;\r\nwhereas I know for certain, and many captains of the British and\r\nAmerican navies know as well as me, that the Feejee Islanders eat not\r\nonly their enemies but one another--and they do it not for spite, but\r\nfor pleasure.  It's a _fact_ that they prefer human flesh to any other.\r\nBut they don't like white men's flesh so well as black; they say it\r\nmakes them sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bill,\" said I, \"you told me just now that they would eat _me_ if\r\nthey caught me!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did, and so I think they would.  I've only heard some o' them say\r\nthey don't like white men _so well_ as black; but if they was hungry\r\nthey wouldn't be particular.  Anyhow, I'm sure they would kill you.  You\r\nsee, Ralph, I've been a good while in them parts, and I've visited the\r\ndifferent groups of islands oftentimes as a trader.  And thorough-goin'\r\nblackguards some o' them traders are--no better than pirates, I can tell\r\nyou.  One captain that I sailed with was not a chip better than the one\r\nwe're with now.  He was trading with a friendly chief one day aboard his\r\nvessel.  The chief had swam off to us with the things for trade tied\r\natop of his head, for them chaps are like otters in the water.  Well,\r\nthe chief was hard on the captain, and would not part with some o' his\r\nthings.  When their bargainin' was over they shook hands, and the chief\r\njumped overboard to swim ashore; but before he got forty yards from the\r\nship, the captain seized a musket and shot him dead.  He then hove up\r\nanchor and put to sea, and as we sailed along the shore he dropped six\r\nblack fellows with his rifle, remarkin' that `that would spoil the trade\r\nfor the next-comers.'  But, as I was sayin', I'm up to the ways o' these\r\nfellows.  One o' the laws o' the country is that every shipwrecked\r\nperson who happens to be cast ashore, be he dead or alive, is doomed to\r\nbe roasted and eaten.  There was a small tradin' schooner wrecked off\r\none of these islands when we were lyin' there in harbour during a storm.\r\nThe crew was lost--all but three men, who swam ashore.  The moment they\r\nlanded, they were seized by the natives and carried up into the woods.\r\nWe knew pretty well what their fate would be; but we could not help\r\nthem, for our crew was small, and if we had gone ashore they would\r\nlikely have killed us all.  We never saw the three men again.  But we\r\nheard frightful yelling and dancing and merrymaking that night; and one\r\nof the natives, who came aboard to trade with us next day, told us that\r\nthe _long pigs_, as he called the men, had been roasted and eaten, and\r\ntheir bones were to be converted into sail-needles.  He also said that\r\nwhite men were bad to eat, and that most o' the people on shore were\r\nsick.\"\r\n\r\nI was very much shocked and cast down in my mind at this terrible\r\naccount of the natives, and asked Bill what he would advise me to do.\r\nLooking round the deck to make sure that we were not overheard, he\r\nlowered his voice and said, \"There are two or three ways that we might\r\nescape, Ralph, but none o' them's easy.  If the captain would only sail\r\nfor some o' the islands near Tahiti we might run away there well enough,\r\nbecause the natives are all Christians; an' we find that wherever the\r\nsavages take up with Christianity they always give over their bloody\r\nways, and are safe to be trusted.  I never cared for Christianity\r\nmyself,\" he continued in a soliloquising voice, \"and I don't well know\r\nwhat it means; but a man with half-an-eye can see what it does for these\r\nblack critters.  However, the captain always keeps a sharp lookout after\r\nus when we get to these islands, for he half-suspects that one or two o'\r\nus are tired of his company.  Then we might manage to cut the boat\r\nadrift some fine night when it's our watch on deck, and clear off before\r\nthey discovered that we were gone.  But we would run the risk o' bein'\r\ncaught by the blacks.  I wouldn't like to try that plan.  But you and I\r\nwill think over it, Ralph, and see what's to be done.  In the meantime\r\nit's our watch below, so I'll go and turn in.\"\r\n\r\nBill then bade me good-night and went below, while a comrade took his\r\nplace at the helm; but feeling no desire to enter into conversation with\r\nhim, I walked aft, and leaning over the stern, looked down into the\r\nphosphorescent waves that gurgled around the rudder, and streamed out\r\nlike a flame of blue light in the vessel's wake.  My thoughts were very\r\nsad, and I could scarce refrain from tears as I contrasted my present\r\nwretched position with the happy, peaceful time I had spent on the Coral\r\nIsland with my dear companions.  As I thought upon Jack and Peterkin,\r\nanxious forebodings crossed my mind, and I pictured to myself the grief\r\nand dismay with which they would search every nook and corner of the\r\nisland in a vain attempt to discover my dead body; for I felt assured\r\nthat if they did not see any sign of the pirate schooner or boat when\r\nthey came out of the cave to look for me, they would never imagine that\r\nI had been carried away.  I wondered, too, how Jack would succeed in\r\ngetting Peterkin out of the cave without my assistance; and I trembled\r\nwhen I thought that he might lose presence of mind, and begin to kick\r\nwhen he was in the tunnel!  These thoughts were suddenly interrupted and\r\nput to flight by a bright-red blaze, which lighted up the horizon to the\r\nsouthward and cast a crimson glow far over the sea.  This appearance was\r\naccompanied by a low growling sound, as of distant thunder, and at the\r\nsame time the sky above us became black, while a hot, stifling wind blew\r\naround us in fitful gusts.\r\n\r\nThe crew assembled hastily on deck, and most of them were under the\r\nbelief that a frightful hurricane was pending; but the captain, coming\r\non deck, soon explained the phenomena.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a volcano,\" said he.  \"I knew there was one hereabouts, but\r\nthought it was extinct.--Up, there, and furl topgallant sails!  We'll\r\nlikely have a breeze, and it's well to be ready.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a shower began to fall, which, we quickly observed, was not\r\nrain, but fine ashes.  As we were many miles distant from the volcano,\r\nthese must have been carried to us from it by the wind.  As the captain\r\nhad predicted, a stiff breeze soon afterwards sprang up, under the\r\ninfluence of which we speedily left the volcano far behind us; but\r\nduring the greater part of the night we could see its lurid glare and\r\nhear its distant thunder.  The shower did not cease to fall for several\r\nhours, and we must have sailed under it for nearly forty miles--perhaps\r\nfarther.  When we emerged from the cloud, our decks and every part of\r\nthe rigging were completely covered with a thick coat of ashes.  I was\r\nmuch interested in this, and recollected that Jack had often spoken of\r\nmany of the islands of the Pacific as being volcanoes, either active or\r\nextinct, and had said that the whole region was more or less volcanic,\r\nand that some scientific men were of opinion that the islands of the\r\nPacific were nothing more or less than the mountain-tops of a huge\r\ncontinent which had sunk under the influence of volcanic agency.\r\n\r\nThree days after passing the volcano, we found ourselves a few miles to\r\nwindward of an island of considerable size and luxuriant aspect.  It\r\nconsisted of two mountains, which seemed to be nearly four thousand feet\r\nhigh.  They were separated from each other by a broad valley, whose\r\nthick-growing trees ascended a considerable distance up the\r\nmountain-sides; and rich, level plains or meadow-land spread round the\r\nbase of the mountains, except at the point immediately opposite the\r\nlarge valley, where a river seemed to carry the trees, as it were, along\r\nwith it down to the white, sandy shore.  The mountain-tops, unlike those\r\nof our Coral Island, were sharp, needle-shaped, and bare, while their\r\nsides were more rugged and grand in outline than anything I had yet seen\r\nin those seas.  Bloody Bill was beside me when the island first hove in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"I know that island well.  They call it Emo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been there before, then?\"  I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that I have, often, and so has this schooner.  'Tis a famous island\r\nfor sandal-wood.  We have taken many cargoes of it already--and have\r\npaid for them, too, for the savages are so numerous that we dared not\r\ntry to take it by force.  But our captain has tried to cheat them so\r\noften that they're beginnin' not to like us overmuch now.  Besides, the\r\nmen behaved ill the last time we were here, and I wonder the captain is\r\nnot afraid to venture.  But he's afraid o' nothin' earthly, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nWe soon ran inside the barrier coral reef, and let go our anchor in six\r\nfathoms water, just opposite the mouth of a small creek, whose shores\r\nwere densely covered with mangroves and tall umbrageous trees.  The\r\nprincipal village of the natives lay about half-a-mile from this point.\r\nOrdering the boat out, the captain jumped into it, and ordered me to\r\nfollow him.  The men, fifteen in number, were well armed; and the mate\r\nwas directed to have Long Tom ready for emergencies.\r\n\r\n\"Give way, lads!\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\nThe oars fell into the water at the word, the boat shot from the\r\nschooner's side, and in a few minutes reached the shore.  Here, contrary\r\nto our expectation, we were met with the utmost cordiality by Romata,\r\nthe principal chief of the island, who conducted us to his house and\r\ngave us mats to sit upon.  I observed in passing that the natives, of\r\nwhom there were two or three thousand, were totally unarmed.\r\n\r\nAfter a short preliminary palaver, a feast of baked pigs and various\r\nroots was spread before us, of which we partook sparingly, and then\r\nproceeded to business.  The captain stated his object in visiting the\r\nisland, regretted that there had been a slight misunderstanding during\r\nthe last visit, and hoped that no ill-will was borne by either party,\r\nand that a satisfactory trade would be accomplished.\r\n\r\nRomata answered that he had forgotten there had been any differences\r\nbetween them, protested that he was delighted to see his friends again,\r\nand assured them they should have every assistance in cutting and\r\nembarking the wood.  The terms were afterwards agreed on, and we rose to\r\ndepart.  All this conversation was afterwards explained to me by Bill,\r\nwho understood the language pretty well.\r\n\r\nRomata accompanied us on board, and explained that a great chief from\r\nanother island was then on a visit to him, and that he was to be\r\nceremoniously entertained on the following day.  After begging to be\r\nallowed to introduce him to us, and receiving permission, he sent his\r\ncanoe ashore to bring him off.  At the same time he gave orders to bring\r\non board his two favourites, a cock and a paroquet.  While the canoe was\r\ngone on this errand, I had time to regard the savage chief attentively.\r\nHe was a man of immense size, with massive but beautifully moulded limbs\r\nand figure, only parts of which--the broad chest and muscular arms--were\r\nuncovered; for although the lower orders generally wore no other\r\nclothing than a strip of cloth called _maro_ round their loins, the\r\nchief, on particular occasions, wrapped his person in voluminous folds\r\nof a species of native cloth made from the bark of the Chinese\r\npaper-mulberry.  Romata wore a magnificent black beard and moustache,\r\nand his hair was frizzed out to such an extent that it resembled a large\r\nturban, in which was stuck a long wooden pin!  I afterwards found that\r\nthis pin served for scratching the head, for which purpose the fingers\r\nwere too short without disarranging the hair.  But Romata put himself to\r\nmuch greater inconvenience on account of his hair; for we found that he\r\nslept with his head resting on a wooden pillow, in which was cut a\r\nhollow for the neck, so that the hair of the sleeper might not be\r\ndisarranged.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes the canoe returned, bringing the other chief, who\r\ncertainly presented a most extraordinary appearance, having painted one\r\nhalf of his face red and the other half yellow, besides ornamenting it\r\nwith various designs in black!  Otherwise he was much the same in\r\nappearance as Romata, though not so powerfully built.  As this chief had\r\nnever seen a ship before--except, perchance, some of the petty traders\r\nthat at long intervals visit these remote islands--he was much taken up\r\nwith the neatness and beauty of all the fittings of the schooner.  He\r\nwas particularly struck with a musket which was shown to him, and asked\r\nwhere the white men got hatchets hard enough to cut the tree of which\r\nthe barrel was made!  While he was thus engaged, his brother-chief stood\r\naloof, talking with the captain, and fondling a superb cock and a little\r\nblue-headed paroquet--the favourites of which I have before spoken.  I\r\nobserved that all the other natives walked in a crouching posture while\r\nin the presence of Romata.  Before our guests left us, the captain\r\nordered the brass gun to be uncovered and fired for their gratification;\r\nand I have every reason to believe he did so for the purpose of showing\r\nour superior power, in case the natives should harbour any evil designs\r\nagainst us.  Romata had never seen this gun before, as it had not been\r\nuncovered on previous visits, and the astonishment with which he viewed\r\nit was very amusing.  Being desirous of knowing its power, he begged\r\nthat the captain would fire it; so a shot was put into it.  The chiefs\r\nwere then directed to look at a rock about two miles out at sea, and the\r\ngun was fired.  In a second the top of the rock was seen to burst\r\nasunder, and to fall in fragments into the sea.\r\n\r\nRomata was so delighted with the success of this shot that he pointed to\r\na man who was walking on the shore, and begged the captain to fire at\r\nhim, evidently supposing that his permission was quite sufficient to\r\njustify the captain in such an act.  He was therefore surprised, and not\r\na little annoyed, when the captain refused to fire at the native and\r\nordered the gun to be housed.\r\n\r\nOf all the things, however, that afforded matter of amusement to these\r\nsavages, that which pleased Romata's visitor most was the ship's pump.\r\nHe never tired of examining it and pumping up the water.  Indeed, so\r\nmuch was he taken up with this pump that he could not be prevailed on to\r\nreturn on shore, but sent a canoe to fetch his favourite stool, on which\r\nhe seated himself, and spent the remainder of the day in pumping the\r\nbilge-water out of the ship!\r\n\r\nNext day the crew went ashore to cut sandal-wood, while the captain,\r\nwith one or two men, remained on board, in order to be ready, if need\r\nbe, with the brass gun, which was unhoused and conspicuously elevated,\r\nwith its capacious muzzle directed point-blank at the chief's house.\r\nThe men were fully armed, as usual; and the captain ordered me to go\r\nwith them, to assist in the work.  I was much pleased with this order,\r\nfor it freed me from the captain's company, which I could not now\r\nendure, and it gave me an opportunity of seeing the natives.\r\n\r\nAs we wound along in single file through the rich, fragrant groves of\r\nbanana, cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, and other trees, I observed that there\r\nwere many of the plum and banyan trees, with which I had become familiar\r\non the Coral Island.  I noticed, also, large quantities of taro--roots,\r\nyams, and sweet potatoes growing in enclosures.  On turning into an open\r\nglade of the woods, we came abruptly upon a cluster of native houses.\r\nThey were built chiefly of bamboos, and were thatched with the large,\r\nthick leaves of the pandanus; but many of them had little more than a\r\nsloping roof and three sides with an open front, being the most simple\r\nshelter from the weather that could well be imagined.  Within these and\r\naround them were groups of natives--men, women, and children--who all\r\nstood up to gaze at us as we marched along, followed by the party of men\r\nwhom the chief had sent to escort us.  About half-a-mile inland we\r\narrived at the spot where the sandal-wood grew, and while the men set to\r\nwork I clambered up an adjoining hill to observe the country.\r\n\r\nAbout midday the chief arrived with several followers, one of whom\r\ncarried a baked pig on a wooden platter, with yams and potatoes on\r\nseveral plantain leaves, which he presented to the men, who sat down\r\nunder the shade of a tree to dine.  The chief sat down to dine also;\r\nbut, to my surprise, instead of feeding himself, one of his wives\r\nperformed that office for him!  I was seated beside Bill, and asked him\r\nthe reason of this.\r\n\r\n\"It is beneath his dignity, I believe, to feed himself,\" answered Bill;\r\n\"but I dare say he's not particular, except on great occasions.  They've\r\na strange custom among them, Ralph, which is called _tabu_, and they\r\ncarry it to great lengths.  If a man chooses a particular tree for his\r\ngod, the fruit o' that tree is tabued to him; and if he eats it, he is\r\nsure to be killed by his people--and eaten, of course, for killing means\r\neating hereaway.  Then, you see that great mop o' hair on the chief's\r\nhead?  Well, he has a lot o' barbers to keep it in order; and it's a law\r\nthat whoever touches the head of a living chief or the body of a dead\r\none, his hands are tabued.  So in that way the barbers' hands are always\r\ntabued, and they daren't use them for their lives, but have to be fed\r\nlike big babies--as they are, sure enough!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's odd, Bill.  But look there,\" said I, pointing to a man whose\r\nskin was of a much lighter colour than the generality of the natives.\r\n\"I've seen a few of these light-skinned fellows among the Feejeeans.\r\nThey seem to me to be of quite a different race.\"\r\n\r\n\"So they are,\" answered Bill.  \"These fellows come from the Tongan\r\nIslands, which lie a long way to the eastward.  They come here to build\r\ntheir big war-canoes; and as these take two, and sometimes four, years\r\nto build, there's always some o' the brown-skins among the black\r\nsarpents o' these islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Bill,\" said I, \"your mentioning serpents reminds me that I\r\nhave not seen a reptile of any kind since I came to this part of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more there are any,\" said Bill, \"if ye except the niggers\r\nthemselves.  There's none on the islands but a lizard or two, and some\r\nsich harmless things; but I never seed any myself.  If there's none on\r\nthe land, however, there's more than enough in the water; and that\r\nreminds me of a wonderful brute they have here.  But come, I'll show it\r\nto you.\"  So saying, Bill arose, and leaving the men still busy with the\r\nbaked pig, led me into the forest.  After proceeding a short distance we\r\ncame upon a small pond of stagnant water.  A native lad had followed us,\r\nto whom we called and beckoned him to come to us.  On Bill saying a few\r\nwords to him, which I did not understand, the boy advanced to the edge\r\nof the pond and gave a low, peculiar whistle.  Immediately the water\r\nbecame agitated, and an enormous eel thrust its head above the surface\r\nand allowed the youth to touch it.  It was about twelve feet long, and\r\nas thick round the body as a man's thigh.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Bill, his lip curling with contempt; \"what do you think of\r\nthat for a god, Ralph?  This is one o' their gods, and it has been fed\r\nwith dozens o' livin' babies already.  How many more it'll get afore it\r\ndies is hard to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Babies!\" said I with an incredulous look.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, babies,\" returned Bill.  \"Your soft-hearted folk at home would say,\r\n`Oh, horrible!  Impossible!' to that, and then go away as comfortable\r\nand unconcerned as if their sayin' `Horrible! impossible!' had made it a\r\nlie.  But I tell you, Ralph, it's a _fact_.  I've seed it with my own\r\neyes the last time I was here; an' mayhap, if you stop awhile at this\r\naccursed place and keep a sharp lookout, you'll see it too.  They don't\r\nfeed it regularly with livin' babies, but they give it one now and then\r\nas a treat.--Bah, you brute!\" cried Bill in disgust, giving the reptile\r\na kick on the snout with his heavy boot that sent it sweltering back in\r\nagony into its loathsome pool.  I thought it lucky for Bill--indeed for\r\nall of us--that the native youth's back happened to be turned at the\r\ntime, for I am certain that if the poor savages had come to know that we\r\nhad so rudely handled their god we should have had to fight our way back\r\nto the ship.  As we retraced our steps I questioned my companion further\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\n\"How comes it, Bill, that the mothers allow such a dreadful thing to be\r\ndone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow it? the mothers _do_ it!  It seems to me that there's nothing too\r\nfiendish or diabolical for these people to do.  Why, in some of the\r\nislands they have an institution called the _Areoi_, and the persons\r\nconnected with that body are ready for any wickedness that mortal man\r\ncan devise.  In fact, they stick at nothing; and one o' their customs is\r\nto murder their infants the moment they are born.  The mothers agree to\r\nit, and the fathers do it.  And the mildest ways they have of murdering\r\nthem is by sticking them through the body with sharp splinters of\r\nbamboo, strangling them with their thumbs, or burying them alive and\r\nstamping them to death while under the sod.\"\r\n\r\nI felt sick at heart while my companion recited these horrors.\r\n\r\n\"But it's a curious fact,\" he continued after a pause, during which we\r\nwalked in silence towards the spot where we had left our comrades--\"it's\r\na curious fact that wherever the missionaries get a footin' all these\r\nthings come to an end at once, an' the savages take to doin' each other\r\ngood and singin' psalms, just like Methodists.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless the missionaries,\" said I, while a feeling of enthusiasm\r\nfilled my heart so that I could speak with difficulty.  \"God bless and\r\nprosper the missionaries till they get a footing in every island of the\r\nsea!\"\r\n\r\n\"I would say Amen to that prayer, Ralph, if I could,\" said Bill, in a\r\ndeep, sad voice; \"but it would be a mere mockery for a man to ask a\r\nblessing for others who dare not ask one for himself.  But, Ralph,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"I've not told you half o' the abominations I have seen\r\ndurin' my life in these seas.  If we pull long together, lad, I'll tell\r\nyou more; and if times have not changed very much since I was here last,\r\nit's like that you'll have a chance o' seeing a little for yourself\r\nbefore long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE SANDAL-WOOD PARTY--NATIVE CHILDREN'S GAMES SOMEWHAT SURPRISING--\r\nDESPERATE AMUSEMENTS SUDDENLY AND FATALLY BROUGHT TO A CLOSE--AN OLD\r\nFRIEND RECOGNISED--NEWS--ROMATA'S MAD CONDUCT.\r\n\r\nNext day the wood-cutting party went ashore again, and I accompanied\r\nthem as before.  During the dinner-hour I wandered into the woods alone,\r\nbeing disinclined for food that day.  I had not rambled far when I found\r\nmyself unexpectedly on the seashore, having crossed a narrow neck of\r\nland which separated the native village from a large bay.  Here I found\r\na party of the islanders busy with one of their war-canoes, which was\r\nalmost ready for launching.  I stood for a long time watching this party\r\nwith great interest, and observed that they fastened the timbers and\r\nplanks to each other very much in the same way in which I had seen Jack\r\nfasten those of our little boat.  But what surprised me most was its\r\nimmense length, which I measured carefully, and found to be a hundred\r\nfeet long; and it was so capacious that it could have held three hundred\r\nmen.  It had the unwieldy outrigger and enormously high stern-posts\r\nwhich I had remarked on the canoe that came to us while I was on the\r\nCoral Island.  Observing some boys playing at games a short way along\r\nthe beach, I resolved to go and watch them; but as I turned from the\r\nnatives who were engaged so busily and cheerfully at their work, I\r\nlittle thought of the terrible event that hung on the completion of that\r\nwar-canoe.\r\n\r\nAdvancing towards the children, who were so numerous that I began to\r\nthink this must be the general playground of the village, I sat down on\r\na grassy bank under the shade of a plantain-tree to watch them.  And a\r\nhappier or more noisy crew I have never seen.  There were at least two\r\nhundred of them, both boys and girls, all of whom were clad in no other\r\ngarments than their own glossy little black skins, except the maro, or\r\nstrip of cloth, round the loins of the boys, and a very short petticoat\r\nor kilt on the girls.  They did not all play at the same game, but\r\namused themselves in different groups.\r\n\r\nOne band was busily engaged in a game exactly similar to our blind man's\r\nbuff.  Another set were walking on stilts, which raised the children\r\nthree feet from the ground.  They were very expert at this amusement,\r\nand seldom tumbled.  In another place I observed a group of girls\r\nstanding together, and apparently enjoying themselves very much; so I\r\nwent up to see what they were doing, and found that they were opening\r\ntheir eyelids with their fingers till their eyes appeared of an enormous\r\nsize, and then thrusting pieces of straw between the upper and lower\r\nlids, across the eyeball, to keep them in that position!  This seemed to\r\nme, I must confess, a very foolish as well as dangerous amusement.\r\nNevertheless, the children seemed to be greatly delighted with the\r\nhideous faces they made.  I pondered this subject a good deal, and\r\nthought that if little children knew how silly they seemed to grown-up\r\npeople when, they make faces, they would not be so fond of doing it.  In\r\nanother place were a number of boys engaged in flying kites; and I could\r\nnot help wondering that some of the games of those little savages should\r\nbe so like to our own, although they had never seen us at play.  But the\r\nkites were different from ours in many respects, being of every variety\r\nof shape.  They were made of very thin cloth, and the boys raised them\r\nto a wonderful height in the air by means of twine made from the\r\ncocoa-nut husk.  Other games there were, some of which showed the\r\nnatural depravity of the hearts of these poor savages, and made me wish\r\nfervently that missionaries might be sent out to them.  But the\r\namusement which the greatest number of the children of both sexes seemed\r\nto take chief delight in was swimming and diving in the sea, and the\r\nexpertness which they exhibited was truly amazing.  They seemed to have\r\ntwo principal games in the water, one of which was to dive off a sort of\r\nstage which had been erected near a deep part of the sea, and chase each\r\nother in the water.  Some of them went down to an extraordinary depth;\r\nothers skimmed along the surface, or rolled over and over like\r\nporpoises, or diving under each other, came up unexpectedly and pulled\r\neach other down by a leg or an arm.  They never seemed to tire of this\r\nsport, and from the great heat of the water in the South Seas, they\r\ncould remain in it nearly all day without feeling chilled.  Many of\r\nthese children were almost infants, scarce able to walk; yet they\r\nstaggered down the beach, flung their round, fat little black bodies\r\nfearlessly into deep water, and struck out to sea with as much\r\nconfidence as ducklings.\r\n\r\nThe other game to which I have referred was swimming in the surf.  But\r\nas this is an amusement in which all engage, from children of ten to\r\ngrey-headed men of sixty, and as I had an opportunity of witnessing it\r\nin perfection the day following, I shall describe it more minutely.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was in honour of their guest that this grand swimming-match\r\nwas got up, for Romata came and told the captain that they were going to\r\nengage in it, and begged him to \"come and see.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of amusement is this surf-swimming?\"  I inquired of Bill as\r\nwe walked together to a part of the shore on which several thousands of\r\nthe natives were assembled.\r\n\r\n\"It's a very favourite lark with these 'xtr'or'nary critters,\" replied\r\nBill, giving a turn to the quid of tobacco that invariably bulged out of\r\nhis left cheek.  \"Ye see, Ralph, them fellows take to the water as soon\r\na'most as they can walk, an' long before they can do that anything\r\nrespectably, so that they are as much at home in the sea as on the land.\r\nWell, ye see, I 'spose they found swimmin' for miles out to sea, and\r\ndivin' fathoms deep, wasn't excitin' enough, so they invented this game\r\no' swimmin' on the surf.  Each man and boy, as you see, has got a short\r\nboard or plank, with which he swims out for a mile or more to sea, and\r\nthen, gettin' on the top o' yon thunderin' breaker, they come to shore\r\non the top of it, yellin' and screechin' like fiends.  It's a marvel to\r\nme that they're not dashed to shivers on the coral reef, for sure an'\r\nsart'in am I that if any o' us tried it, we wouldn't be worth the fluke\r\nof a broken anchor after the wave fell.  But there they go!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, several hundreds of the natives, amongst whom we were now\r\nstanding, uttered a loud yell, rushed down the beach, plunged into the\r\nsurf, and were carried off by the seething foam of the retreating wave.\r\n\r\nAt the point where we stood, the encircling coral reef joined the shore,\r\nso that the magnificent breakers, which a recent stiff breeze had\r\nrendered larger than usual, fell in thunder at the feet of the\r\nmultitudes who lined the beach.  For some time the swimmers continued to\r\nstrike out to sea, breasting over the swell like hundreds of black\r\nseals.  Then they all turned, and watching an approaching billow,\r\nmounted its white crest, and each laying his breast on the short, flat\r\nboard, came rolling towards the shore, careering on the summit of the\r\nmighty wave, while they and the onlookers shouted and yelled with\r\nexcitement.  Just as the monster wave curled in solemn majesty to fling\r\nits bulky length upon the beach, most of the swimmers slid back into the\r\ntrough behind; others, slipping off their boards, seized them in their\r\nhands, and plunging through the watery waste, swam out to repeat the\r\namusement; but a few, who seemed to me the most reckless, continued\r\ntheir career until they were launched upon the beach and enveloped in\r\nthe churning foam and spray.  One of these last came in on the crest of\r\nthe wave most manfully, and landed with a violent bound almost on the\r\nspot where Bill and I stood.  I saw by his peculiar head-dress that he\r\nwas the chief whom the tribe entertained as their guest.  The sea-water\r\nhad removed nearly all the paint with which his face had been covered,\r\nand as he rose panting to his feet, I recognised, to my surprise, the\r\nfeatures of Tararo, my old friend of the Coral Island!\r\n\r\nTararo at the same moment recognised me, and advancing quickly, took me\r\nround the neck and rubbed noses, which had the effect of transferring a\r\ngood deal of the moist paint from his nose to mine.  Then, recollecting\r\nthat this was not the white man's mode of salutation, he grasped me by\r\nthe hand and shook it violently.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Ralph!\" cried Bill in surprise, \"that chap seems to have taken a\r\nsudden fancy to you, or he must be an old acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, Bill,\" I replied; \"he is indeed an old acquaintance.\"  And I\r\nexplained, in a few words, that he was the chief whose party Jack and\r\nPeterkin and I had helped to save.\r\n\r\nTararo having thrown away his surf-board, entered into an animated\r\nconversation with Bill, pointing frequently during the course of it to\r\nme, whereby I concluded he must be telling him about the memorable\r\nbattle and the part we had taken in it.  When he paused I begged of Bill\r\nto ask him about the woman Avatea, for I had some hope that she might\r\nhave come with Tararo on this visit.  \"And ask him,\" said I, \"who she\r\nis, for I am persuaded she is of a different race from the Feejeeans.\"\r\nOn the mention of her name the chief frowned darkly, and seemed to speak\r\nwith much anger.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Ralph,\" said Bill when the chief had ceased to talk;\r\n\"she's not a Feejee girl, but a Samoan.  How she ever came to this place\r\nthe chief does not very clearly explain; but he says she was taken in\r\nwar, and that he got her three years ago, an' kept her as his daughter\r\never since.  Lucky for her, poor girl, else she'd have been roasted and\r\neaten like the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why does Tararo frown and look so angry?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Because the girl's somewhat obstinate, like most o' the sex, an' won't\r\nmarry the man he wants her to.  It seems that a chief of some other\r\nisland came on a visit to Tararo and took a fancy to her; but she\r\nwouldn't have him on no account, bein' already in love, and engaged to a\r\nyoung chief whom Tararo hates, and she kicked up a desperate shindy.\r\nSo, as he was goin' on a war-expedition in his canoe, he left her to\r\nthink about it, sayin' he'd be back in six months or so, when he hoped\r\nshe wouldn't be so obstropolous.  This happened just a week ago; an'\r\nTararo says that if she's not ready to go, when the chief returns, as\r\nhis bride, she'll be sent to him as a _long pig_.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a long pig!\"  I exclaimed in surprise.  \"Why, what does he mean by\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"He means somethin' very unpleasant,\" answered Bill with a frown.  \"You\r\nsee, these blackguards eat men an' women just as readily as they eat\r\npigs; and as baked pigs and baked men are very like each other in\r\nappearance, they call men _long_ pigs.  If Avatea goes to this fellow as\r\na long pig, it's all up with her, poor thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she on the island now?\"  I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"No; she's at Tararo's island.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where does it lie?\"\r\n\r\n\"About fifty or sixty miles to the south'ard o' this,\" returned Bill;\r\n\"but I--\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment we were startled by the cry of \"mao! mao--a shark! a\r\nshark!\" which was immediately followed by a shriek that rang clear and\r\nfearfully loud above the tumult of cries that arose from the savages in\r\nthe water and on the land.  We turned hastily towards the direction\r\nwhence the cry came, and had just time to observe the glaring eyeballs\r\nof one of the swimmers as he tossed his arms in the air.  Next instant\r\nhe was pulled under the waves.  A canoe was instantly launched, and the\r\nhand of the drowning man was caught; but only half of his body was\r\ndragged from the maw of the monster, which followed the canoe until the\r\nwater became so shallow that it could scarcely swim.  The crest of the\r\nnext billow was tinged with red as it rolled towards the shore.\r\n\r\nIn most countries of the world this would have made a deep impression on\r\nthe spectators; but the only effect it had upon these islanders was to\r\nmake them hurry with all speed out of the sea, lest a similar fate\r\nshould befall some of the others.  But so utterly reckless were they of\r\nhuman life that it did not for a moment suspend the progress of their\r\namusements.  It is true the surf-swimming ended for that time somewhat\r\nabruptly, but they immediately proceeded with other games.  Bill told me\r\nthat sharks do not often attack the surf-swimmers, being frightened away\r\nby the immense numbers of men and boys in the water, and by the shouting\r\nand splashing that they make.  \"But,\" said he, \"such a thing as you have\r\nseen just now don't frighten them much.  They'll be at it again\r\nto-morrow or next day, just as if there wasn't a single shark between\r\nFeejee and Nova Zembla.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this the natives had a series of wrestling and boxing matches; and\r\nbeing men of immense size and muscle, they did a good deal of injury to\r\neach other, especially in boxing, in which not only the lower orders but\r\nseveral of the chiefs and priests engaged.  Each bout was very quickly\r\nterminated; for they did not pretend to a scientific knowledge of the\r\nart, and wasted, no time in sparring, but hit straight out at each\r\nother's heads, and their blows were delivered with great force.\r\nFrequently one of the combatants was knocked down with a single blow,\r\nand one gigantic fellow hit his adversary so severely that he drove the\r\nskin entirely off his forehead.  This feat was hailed with immense\r\napplause by the spectators.\r\n\r\nDuring these exhibitions, which were very painful to me, though I\r\nconfess I could not refrain from beholding them, I was struck with the\r\nbeauty of many of the figures and designs that were tattooed on the\r\npersons of the chiefs and principal men.  One figure, that seemed to me\r\nvery elegant, was that of a palm-tree tattooed on the back of a man's\r\nleg, the roots rising, as it were, from under his heel, the stem\r\nascending the tendon of the ankle, and the graceful head branching out\r\nupon the calf.  I afterwards learned that this process of tattooing is\r\nvery painful, and takes long to do, commencing at the age of ten, and\r\nbeing continued at intervals up to the age of thirty.  It is done by\r\nmeans of an instrument made of bone, with a number of sharp teeth, with\r\nwhich the skin is punctured.  Into these punctures a preparation made\r\nfrom the kernel of the candle-nut, mixed with cocoa-nut oil, is rubbed,\r\nand the mark thus made is indelible.  The operation is performed by a\r\nclass of men whose profession it is, and they tattoo as much at a time\r\nas the person on whom they are operating can bear, which is not much,\r\nthe pain and inflammation caused by tattooing being very great--\r\nsometimes causing death.  Some of the chiefs were tattooed with an\r\nornamental stripe down the legs, which gave them the appearance of being\r\nclad in tights; others had marks round the ankles and insteps, which\r\nlooked like tight-fitting and elegant boots.  Their faces were also\r\ntattooed, and their breasts were very profusely marked with every\r\nimaginable species of device--muskets, dogs, birds, pigs, clubs, and\r\ncanoes, intermingled with lozenges, squares, circles, and other\r\narbitrary figures.\r\n\r\nThe women were not tattooed so much as the men, having only a few marks\r\non their feet and arms.  But I must say, however objectionable this\r\nstrange practice may be, it nevertheless had this good effect--that it\r\ntook away very much from their appearance of nakedness.\r\n\r\nNext day, while we were returning from the woods to our schooner, we\r\nobserved Romata rushing about in the neighbourhood of his house,\r\napparently mad with passion.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Bill to me, \"there he's at his old tricks again.  That's his\r\nway when he gets drink.  The natives make a sort of drink o' their own,\r\nand it makes him bad enough; but when he gets brandy he's like a wild\r\ntiger.  The captain, I suppose, has given him a bottle, as usual, to\r\nkeep him in good-humour.  After drinkin' he usually goes to sleep, and\r\nthe people know it well, and keep out of his way for fear they should\r\nwaken him.  Even the babies are taken out of earshot; for when he's\r\nwaked up he rushes out, just as you see him now, and spears or clubs the\r\nfirst person he meets.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed at the present time, however, that no deadly weapon had been\r\nin his way, for the infuriated chief was raging about without one.\r\nSuddenly he caught sight of an unfortunate man who was trying to conceal\r\nhimself behind a tree.  Rushing towards him, Romata struck him a\r\nterrible blow on the head, which knocked out the poor man's eye and also\r\ndislocated the chief's finger.  The wretched creature offered no\r\nresistance; he did not even attempt to parry the blow.  Indeed, from\r\nwhat Bill said, I found that he might consider himself lucky in having\r\nescaped with his life, which would certainly have been forfeited had the\r\nchief been possessed of a club at the time.\r\n\r\n\"Have these wretched creatures no law among themselves,\" said I, \"which\r\ncan restrain such wickedness?\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" replied Bill.  \"The chief's word is law.  He might kill and eat\r\na dozen of his own subjects any day for nothing more than his own\r\npleasure, and nobody would take the least notice of it.\"\r\n\r\nThis ferocious deed took place within sight of our party as we wended\r\nour way to the beach, but I could not observe any other expression on\r\nthe faces of the men than that of total indifference or contempt.  It\r\nseemed to me a very awful thing that it should be possible for men to\r\ncome to such hardness of heart and callousness to the sight of bloodshed\r\nand violence; but, indeed, I began to find that such constant exposure\r\nto scenes of blood was having a slight effect upon myself, and I\r\nshuddered when I came to think that I too was becoming callous.\r\n\r\nI thought upon this subject much that night while I walked up and down\r\nthe deck during my hours of watch, and I came to the conclusion that if\r\nI, who hated, abhorred, and detested such bloody deeds as I had\r\nwitnessed within the last few weeks, could so soon come to be less\r\nsensitive about them, how little wonder that these poor, ignorant\r\nsavages, who were born and bred in familiarity therewith, should think\r\nnothing of them at all, and should hold human life in so very slight\r\nesteem!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nMISCHIEF BREWING--MY BLOOD IS MADE TO RUN COLD--EVIL CONSULTATIONS AND\r\nWICKED RESOLVES--BLOODY BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO GOOD, AND FAILS--THE\r\nATTACK--WHOLESALE MURDER--THE FLIGHT--THE ESCAPE.\r\n\r\nNext morning I awoke with a feverish brow and a feeling of deep\r\ndepression at my heart; and the more I thought on my unhappy fate, the\r\nmore wretched and miserable did I feel.\r\n\r\nI was surrounded on all sides by human beings of the most dreadful\r\ncharacter, to whom the shedding of blood was mere pastime.  On shore\r\nwere the natives, whose practices were so horrible that I could not\r\nthink of them without shuddering.  On board were none but pirates of the\r\nblackest dye, who, although not cannibals, were foul murderers, and more\r\nblameworthy even than the savages, inasmuch as they knew better.  Even\r\nBill, with whom I had, under the strange circumstances of my lot, formed\r\na kind of intimacy, was so fierce in his nature as to have acquired the\r\ntitle of \"Bloody\" from his vile companions.  I felt very much cast down\r\nthe more I considered the subject and the impossibility of delivery, as\r\nit seemed to me--at least, for a long time to come.  At last, in my\r\nfeeling of utter helplessness, I prayed fervently to the Almighty that\r\nHe would deliver me out of my miserable condition; and when I had done\r\nso I felt some degree of comfort.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain came on deck, before the hour at which the men usually\r\nstarted for the woods, I begged of him to permit me to remain aboard\r\nthat day, as I did not feel well; but he looked at me angrily, and\r\nordered me, in a surly tone, to get ready to go on shore as usual.  The\r\nfact was that the captain had been out of humour for some time past.\r\nRomata and he had had some differences, and high words had passed\r\nbetween them, during which the chief had threatened to send a fleet of\r\nhis war-canoes, with a thousand men, to break up and burn the schooner;\r\nwhereupon the captain smiled sarcastically, and going up to the chief,\r\ngazed sternly in his face while he said, \"I have only to raise my little\r\nfinger just now, and my big gun will blow your whole village to atoms in\r\nfive minutes!\"  Although the chief was a bold man, he quailed before the\r\npirate's glance and threat, and made no reply; but a bad feeling had\r\nbeen raised, and old sores had been opened.\r\n\r\nI had, therefore, to go with the woodcutters that day.  Before starting,\r\nhowever, the captain called me into the cabin and said:\r\n\r\n\"Here, Ralph; I've got a mission for you, lad.  That blackguard Romata\r\nis in the dumps, and nothing will mollify him but a gift; so do you go\r\nup to his house and give him these whale's teeth, with my compliments.\r\nTake with you one of the men who can speak the language.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the gift in some surprise, for it consisted of six white\r\nwhale's teeth, and two of the same dyed bright red, which seemed to me\r\nvery paltry things.  However, I did not dare to hesitate, or to ask any\r\nquestions; so gathering them up, I left the cabin, and was soon on my\r\nway to the chief's house, accompanied by Bill.  On expressing my\r\nsurprise at the gift, he said:\r\n\r\n\"They're paltry enough to you or me, Ralph, but they're considered of\r\ngreat value by them chaps.  They're a sort o' cash among them.  The red\r\nones are the most prized, one of them bein' equal to twenty o' the white\r\nones.  I suppose the only reason for their bein' valuable is that there\r\nain't many of them, and they're hard to be got.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the house we found Romata sitting on a mat, in the midst\r\nof a number of large bales of native cloth and other articles, which had\r\nbeen brought to him as presents from time to time by inferior chiefs.\r\nHe received us rather haughtily; but on Bill explaining the nature of\r\nour errand, he became very condescending, and his eyes glistened with\r\nsatisfaction when he received the whale's teeth, although he laid them\r\naside with an assumption of kingly indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" said he with a wave of the hand--\"go tell your captain that he may\r\ncut wood to-day, but not to-morrow.  He must come ashore; I want to have\r\na palaver with him.\"\r\n\r\nAs we left the house to return to the woods, Bill shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"There's mischief brewin' in that black rascal's head.  I know him of\r\nold.  But what comes here?\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, we heard the sound of laughter and shouting in the wood,\r\nand presently there issued from it a band of savages, in the midst of\r\nwhom were a number of men bearing burdens on their shoulders.  At first\r\nI thought that these burdens were poles with something rolled round\r\nthem, the end of each pole resting on a man's shoulder; but on a nearer\r\napproach I saw that they were human beings, tied hand and foot, and so\r\nlashed to the poles that they could not move.  I counted twenty of them\r\nas they passed.\r\n\r\n\"More murder!\" said Bill in a voice that sounded between a hoarse laugh\r\nand a groan.\r\n\r\n\"Surely they are not going to murder them?\" said I, looking anxiously\r\ninto Bill's face.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Ralph,\" replied Bill, \"what they're goin' to do with\r\nthem; but I fear they mean no good when they tie fellows up in that\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nAs we continued our way towards the woodcutters, I observed that Bill\r\nlooked anxiously over his shoulder in the direction where the procession\r\nhad disappeared.  At last he stopped, and turning abruptly on his heel,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I tell ye what it is, Ralph: I must be at the bottom o' that affair.\r\nLet us follow these black scoundrels and see what they're goin' to do.\"\r\n\r\nI must say I had no wish to pry further into their bloody practices; but\r\nBill seemed bent on it, so I turned and went.  We passed rapidly through\r\nthe bush, being guided in the right direction by the shouts of the\r\nsavages.  Suddenly there was a dead silence, which continued for some\r\ntime, while Bill and I involuntarily quickened our pace until we were\r\nrunning at the top of our speed across the narrow neck of land\r\npreviously mentioned.  As we reached the verge of the wood we discovered\r\nthe savages surrounding the large war-canoe, which they were apparently\r\non the point of launching.  Suddenly the multitude put their united\r\nstrength to the canoe; but scarcely had the huge machine begun to move\r\nwhen a yell, the most appalling that ever fell upon my ear, rose high\r\nabove the shouting of the savages.  It had not died away when another\r\nand another smote upon my throbbing ear, and then I saw that these\r\ninhuman monsters were actually launching their canoe over the living\r\nbodies of their victims.  But there was no pity in the breasts of these\r\nmen.  Forward they went in ruthless indifference, shouting as they went,\r\nwhile high above their voices rang the dying shrieks of those wretched\r\ncreatures as, one after another, the ponderous canoe passed over them,\r\nburst the eyeballs from their sockets, and sent the life-blood gushing\r\nfrom their mouths.  Oh reader, this is no fiction!  I would not, for the\r\nsake of thrilling you with horror, invent so terrible a scene.  It was\r\nwitnessed.  It is true--true as that accursed sin which has rendered the\r\nhuman heart capable of such diabolical enormities!\r\n\r\nWhen it was over I turned round and fell upon the grass with a deep\r\ngroan; but Bill seized me by the arm, and lifting me up as if I had been\r\na child, cried:\r\n\r\n\"Come along, lad; let's away!\"  And so, staggering and stumbling over\r\nthe tangled underwood, we fled from the fatal spot.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of that day I felt as if I were in a horrible\r\ndream.  I scarce knew what was said to me, and was more than once blamed\r\nby the men for idling my time.  At last the hour to return aboard came.\r\nWe marched down to the beach, and I felt relief for the first time when\r\nmy feet rested on the schooner's deck.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening I overheard part of a conversation between\r\nthe captain and the first mate, which startled me not a little.  They\r\nwere down in the cabin, and conversed in an undertone; but the skylight\r\nbeing off; I overhead every word that was said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't half-like it,\" said the mate.  \"It seems to me that we'll only\r\nhave hard fightin' and no pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"No pay!\" repeated the captain in a voice of suppressed anger.  \"Do you\r\ncall a good cargo all for nothing no pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" returned the mate; \"but we've got the cargo aboard.  Why\r\nnot cut your cable and take French leave o' them?  What's the use o'\r\ntryin' to kill the blackguards when it'll do us no manner o' good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mate,\" said the captain in a low voice, \"you talk like a fresh-water\r\nsailor.  I can only attribute this shyness to some strange delusion, for\r\nsurely,\"--his voice assumed a slightly sneering tone as he said\r\nthis--\"surely I am not to suppose that you have become soft-hearted!\r\nBesides, you are wrong in regard to the cargo being aboard; there's a\r\ngood quarter of it lying in the woods, and that blackguard chief knows\r\nit, and won't let me take it off.  He defied us to do our worst\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Defied us! did he?\" cried the mate with a bitter laugh.  \"Poor,\r\ncontemptible thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet he seems not so contemptible but that you are afraid to attack\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who said I was afraid?\" growled the mate sulkily.  \"I'm as ready as any\r\nman in the ship.  But, captain, what is it that you intend to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to muffle the sweeps and row the schooner up to the head of\r\nthe creek there, from which point we can command the pile of sandal-wood\r\nwith our gun.  Then I shall land with all the men except two, who shall\r\ntake care of the schooner and be ready with the boat to take us off.  We\r\ncan creep through the woods to the head of the village, where these\r\ncannibals are always dancing round their suppers of human flesh; and if\r\nthe carbines of the men are loaded with a heavy charge of buck-shot, we\r\ncan drop forty or fifty at the first volley.  After that the thing will\r\nbe easy enough.  The savages will take to the mountains in a body, and\r\nwe shall take what we require, up anchor, and away.\"\r\n\r\nTo this plan the mate at length agreed.  As he left the cabin, I heard\r\nthe captain say:\r\n\r\n\"Give the men an extra glass of grog, and don't forget the buck-shot.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader may conceive the horror with which I heard this murderous\r\nconversation.  I immediately repeated it to Bill, who seemed much\r\nperplexed about it.  At length he said:\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do, Ralph.  I'll swim ashore after dark and fix\r\na musket to a tree not far from the place where we'll have to land, and\r\nI'll tie a long string to the trigger, so that when our fellows cross it\r\nthey'll let it off, and so alarm the village in time to prevent an\r\nattack, but not in time to prevent us gettin' back to the boat.--So,\r\nMaster Captain,\" added Bill with a smile that, for the first time,\r\nseemed to me to be mingled with good-natured cheerfulness, \"you'll be\r\nbalked at least for once in your life by Bloody Bill.\"\r\n\r\nAfter it grew dark, Bill put this resolve in practice.  He slipped over\r\nthe side with a musket in his left hand, while with his right he swam\r\nashore and entered the woods.  He soon returned, having accomplished his\r\npurpose, and got on board without being seen, I being the only one on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour of midnight approached, the men were mustered on deck, the\r\ncable was cut, and the muffled sweeps got out.  These sweeps were\r\nimmensely large oars, each requiring a couple of men to work it.  In a\r\nfew minutes we entered the mouth of the creek, which was indeed the\r\nmouth of a small river, and took about half-an-hour to ascend it,\r\nalthough the spot where we intended to land was not more than six\r\nhundred yards from the mouth, because there was a slight current against\r\nus, and the mangroves which narrowed the creek impeded the rowers in\r\nsome places.  Having reached the spot, which was so darkened by\r\noverhanging trees that we could see with difficulty, a small\r\nkedge-anchor attached to a thin line was let softly down over the stern.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" whispered the captain as he walked along the line of men,\r\nwho were all armed to the teeth, \"don't be in a hurry, aim low, and\r\ndon't waste your first shots.\"\r\n\r\nHe then pointed to the boat, into which the men crowded in silence.\r\nThere was no room to row; but oars were not needed, as a slight push\r\nagainst the side of the schooner sent the boat gliding to the shore.\r\n\r\n\"There's no need of leaving two in the boat,\" whispered the mate as the\r\nmen stepped out; \"we shall want all our hands.  Let Ralph stay.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain assented, and ordered me to stand in readiness with the\r\nboat-hook, to shove ashore at a moment's notice if they should return,\r\nor to shove off if any of the savages should happen to approach.  He\r\nthen threw his carbine into the hollow of his arm, and glided through\r\nthe bushes, followed by his men.  With a throbbing heart I awaited the\r\nresult of our plan.  I knew the exact locality where the musket was\r\nplaced, for Bill had described it to me, and I kept my straining eyes\r\nfixed upon the spot.  But no sound came, and I began to fear that either\r\nthey had gone in another direction or that Bill had not fixed the string\r\nproperly.  Suddenly I heard a faint click, and observed one or two\r\nbright sparks among the bushes.  My heart immediately sank within me,\r\nfor I knew at once that the trigger had indeed been pulled, but that the\r\npriming had not caught.  The plan, therefore, had utterly failed.  A\r\nfeeling of dread now began to creep over me as I stood in the boat, in\r\nthat dark, silent spot, awaiting the issue of this murderous expedition.\r\nI shuddered as I glanced at the water that glided past like a dark\r\nreptile.  I looked back at the schooner; but her hull was just barely\r\nvisible, while her tapering masts were lost among the trees which\r\novershadowed her.  Her lower sails were set, but so thick was the gloom\r\nthat they were quite invisible.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard a shot.  In a moment a thousand voices raised a yell in\r\nthe village; again the cry rose on the night air, and was followed by\r\nbroken shouts as of scattered parties of men bounding into the woods.\r\nThen I heard another shout, loud and close at hand; it was the voice of\r\nthe captain cursing the man who had fired the premature shot.  Then came\r\nthe order, \"Forward!\" followed by a wild hurrah of our men as they\r\ncharged the savages.  Shots now rang in quick succession, and at last a\r\nloud volley startled the echoes of the woods.  It was followed by a\r\nmultitude of wild shrieks, which were immediately drowned in another\r\nhurrah from the men, the distance of the sound proving that they were\r\ndriving their enemies before them towards the sea.\r\n\r\nWhile I was listening intently to these sounds, which were now mingled\r\nin confusion, I was startled by the rustling of the leaves not far from\r\nme.  At first I thought it was a party of savages who had observed the\r\nschooner, but I was speedily undeceived by observing a body of natives--\r\napparently several hundreds, as far as I could guess in the uncertain\r\nlight--bounding through the woods towards the scene of battle.  I saw at\r\nonce that this was a party who had outflanked our men, and would\r\nspeedily attack them in the rear.  And so it turned out; for in a short\r\ntime the shouts increased tenfold, and among them I thought I heard a\r\ndeath-cry uttered by voices familiar to my ear.\r\n\r\nAt length the tumult of battle ceased, and from the cries of exultation\r\nthat now arose from the savages, I felt assured that our men had been\r\nconquered.  I was immediately thrown into dreadful consternation.  What\r\nwas I now to do?  To be taken by the savages was too horrible to be\r\nthought of; to flee to the mountains was hopeless, as I should soon be\r\ndiscovered; and to take the schooner out of the creek without assistance\r\nwas impossible.  I resolved, however, to make the attempt, as being my\r\nonly hope, and was on the point of pushing off, when my hand was stayed\r\nand my blood chilled by an appalling shriek, in which I recognised the\r\nvoice of one of the crew.  It was succeeded by a shout from the savages.\r\nThen came another and another shriek of agony, making my ears to\r\ntingle, as I felt convinced they were murdering the pirate crew in cold\r\nblood.  With a bursting heart and my brain whirling as if on fire, I\r\nseized the boat-hook to push from shore when a man sprang from the\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!  Ralph, stop!  There, now, push off!\" he cried, and bounded into\r\nthe boat so violently as nearly to upset her.  It was Bill's voice!  In\r\nanother moment we were on board--the boat made fast, the line of the\r\nanchor cut, and the sweeps run out.  At the first stroke of Bill's giant\r\narm the schooner was nearly pulled ashore, for in his haste he forgot\r\nthat I could scarcely move the unwieldy oar.  Springing to the stern, he\r\nlashed the rudder in such a position as that, while it aided me, it\r\nacted against him, and so rendered the force of our strokes nearly\r\nequal.  The schooner now began to glide quickly down the creek; but\r\nbefore we reached its mouth, a yell from a thousand voices on the bank\r\ntold that we were discovered.  Instantly a number of the savages plunged\r\ninto the water and swam towards us; but we were making so much way that\r\nthey could not overtake us.  One, however, an immensely powerful man,\r\nsucceeded in laying hold of the cut rope that hung from the stern, and\r\nclambered quickly upon deck.  Bill caught sight of him the instant his\r\nhead appeared above the taffrail.  But he did not cease to row, and did\r\nnot appear even to notice the savage until he was within a yard of him;\r\nthen dropping the sweep, he struck him a blow on the forehead with his\r\nclenched fist that felled him to the deck.  Lifting him up, he hurled\r\nhim overboard, and resumed the oar.  But now a greater danger awaited\r\nus; for the savages had outrun us on the bank, and were about to plunge\r\ninto the water ahead of the schooner.  If they succeeded in doing so,\r\nour fate was sealed.  For one moment Bill stood irresolute.  Then\r\ndrawing a pistol from his belt, he sprang to the brass gun, held the pan\r\nof his pistol over the touch-hole, and fired.  The shot was succeeded by\r\nthe hiss of the cannon's priming; then the blaze and the crashing\r\nthunder of the monstrous gun burst upon the savages with such deafening\r\nroar that it seemed as if their very mountains had been rent asunder.\r\n\r\nThis was enough.  The moment of surprise and hesitation caused by the\r\nunwonted sound gave us time to pass the point; a gentle breeze, which\r\nthe dense foliage had hitherto prevented us from feeling, bulged out our\r\nsails; the schooner bent before it, and the shouts of the disappointed\r\nsavages grew fainter and fainter in the distance as we were slowly\r\nwafted out to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS--THE WOUNDED MAN--THE SQUALL--TRUE CONSOLATION--DEATH.\r\n\r\nThere is a power of endurance in human beings, both in their bodies and\r\nin their minds, which, I have often thought, seems to be wonderfully\r\nadapted and exactly proportioned to the circumstances in which\r\nindividuals may happen to be placed--a power which, in most cases, is\r\nsufficient to carry a man through and over every obstacle that may\r\nhappen to be thrown in his path through life, no matter how high or how\r\nsteep the mountain may be, but which often forsakes him the moment the\r\nsummit is gained, the point of difficulty passed, and leaves him\r\nprostrated, with energies gone, nerves unstrung, and a feeling of\r\nincapacity pervading the entire frame that renders the most trifling\r\neffort almost impossible.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of that day I had been subjected to severe\r\nmental and much physical excitement, which had almost crushed me down by\r\nthe time I was relieved from duty in the course of the evening.  But\r\nwhen the expedition whose failure has just been narrated was planned, my\r\nanxieties and energies had been so powerfully aroused that I went\r\nthrough the protracted scenes of that terrible night without a feeling\r\nof the slightest fatigue.  My mind and body were alike active and full\r\nof energy.  No sooner was the last thrilling fear of danger past,\r\nhowever, than my faculties were utterly relaxed; and when I felt the\r\ncool breezes of the Pacific playing around my fevered brow, and heard\r\nthe free waves rippling at the schooner's prow, as we left the hated\r\nisland behind us, my senses forsook me, and I fell in a swoon upon the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nFrom this state I was quickly aroused by Bill, who shook me by the arm,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Ralph, boy!  Rouse up, lad; we're safe now!  Poor thing!  I\r\nbelieve he's fainted.\"  And raising me in his arms he laid me on the\r\nfolds of the gaff-topsail, which lay upon the deck near the tiller.\r\n\"Here, take a drop o' this; it'll do you good, my boy,\" he added in a\r\nvoice of tenderness which I had never heard him use before, while he\r\nheld a brandy-flask to my lips.\r\n\r\nI raised my eyes gratefully as I swallowed a mouthful; next moment my\r\nhead sank heavily upon my arm, and I fell fast asleep.  I slept long,\r\nfor when I awoke the sun was a good way above the horizon.  I did not\r\nmove on first opening my eyes, as I felt a delightful sensation of rest\r\npervading me, and my eyes were riveted on and charmed with the gorgeous\r\nsplendour of the mighty ocean that burst upon my sight.  It was a dead\r\ncalm; the sea seemed a sheet of undulating crystal, tipped and streaked\r\nwith the saffron hues of sunrise, which had not yet merged into the\r\nglowing heat of noon; and there was a deep calm in the blue dome above\r\nthat was not broken even by the usual flutter of the sea-fowl.  How long\r\nI would have lain in contemplation of this peaceful scene I know not,\r\nbut my mind was recalled suddenly and painfully to the past and the\r\npresent by the sight of Bill, who was seated on the deck at my feet,\r\nwith his head reclining, as if in sleep, on his right arm, which rested\r\non the tiller.  As he seemed to rest peacefully, I did not mean to\r\ndisturb him; but the slight noise I made in raising myself on my elbow\r\ncaused him to start and look round.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ralph, awake at last, my boy?  You have slept long and soundly,\"\r\nhe said, turning towards me.\r\n\r\nOn beholding his countenance I sprang up in anxiety.  He was deadly\r\npale, and his hair, which hung in dishevelled locks over his face, was\r\nclotted with blood.  Blood also stained his hollow cheeks and covered\r\nthe front of his shirt, which, with the greater part of his dress, was\r\ntorn and soiled with mud.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Bill!\" said I with deep anxiety, \"what is the matter with you?  You\r\nare ill.  You must have been wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so, lad,\" said Bill in a deep, soft voice, while he extended his\r\nhuge frame on the couch from which I had just risen.  \"I've got an ugly\r\nwound, I fear; and I've been waiting for you to waken to ask you to get\r\nme a drop o' brandy and a mouthful o' bread from the cabin lockers.  You\r\nseemed to sleep so sweetly, Ralph, that I didn't like to disturb you.\r\nBut I don't feel up to much just now.\"\r\n\r\nI did not wait till he had done talking, but ran below immediately, and\r\nreturned in a few seconds with a bottle of brandy and some broken\r\nbiscuit.  He seemed much refreshed after eating a few morsels and\r\ndrinking a long draught of water mingled with a little of the spirits.\r\nImmediately afterwards he fell asleep, and I watched him anxiously until\r\nhe awoke, being desirous of knowing the nature and extent of his wound.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed on awaking suddenly, after a slumber of an hour; \"I'm\r\nthe better of that nap, Ralph.  I feel twice the man I was;\" and he\r\nattempted to rise, but sank back again immediately with a deep groan.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Bill, you must not move, but lie still while I look at your wound.\r\nI'll make a comfortable bed for you here on deck, and get you some\r\nbreakfast.  After that you shall tell me how you got it.  Cheer up,\r\nBill!\"  I added, seeing that he turned his head away; \"you'll be all\r\nright in a little, and I'll be a capital nurse to you, though I'm no\r\ndoctor.\"\r\n\r\nI then left him, and lighted a fire in the caboose.  While it was\r\nkindling, I went to the steward's pantry and procured the materials for\r\na good breakfast, with which, in little more than half-an-hour, I\r\nreturned to my companion.  He seemed much better, and smiled kindly on\r\nme as I set before him a cup of coffee and a tray with several eggs and\r\nsome bread on it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, Bill,\" said I cheerfully, sitting down beside him on the\r\ndeck, \"let's fall to.  I'm very hungry myself, I can tell you.  But--I\r\nforgot--your wound,\" I added, rising; \"let me look at it.\"\r\n\r\nI found that the wound was caused by a pistol-shot in the chest.  It did\r\nnot bleed much, and as it was on the right side, I was in hopes that it\r\nmight not be very serious.  But Bill shook his head.  \"However,\" said\r\nhe, \"sit down, Ralph, and I'll tell you all about it.\r\n\r\n\"You see, after we left the boat an' began to push through the bushes,\r\nwe went straight for the line of my musket, as I had expected.  But by\r\nsome unlucky chance it didn't explode, for I saw the line torn away by\r\nthe men's legs, and heard the click o' the lock; so I fancy the priming\r\nhad got damp and didn't catch.  I was in a great quandary now what to\r\ndo, for I couldn't concoct in my mind, in the hurry, any good reason for\r\nfirin' off my piece.  But they say necessity's the mother of invention;\r\nso just as I was giving it up and clinchin' my teeth to bide the worst\r\no't and take what should come, a sudden thought came into my head.  I\r\nstepped out before the rest, seemin' to be awful anxious to be at the\r\nsavages, tripped my foot on a fallen tree, plunged head foremost into a\r\nbush, an' ov coorse my carbine exploded!  Then came such a screechin'\r\nfrom the camp as I never heard in all my life.  I rose at once, and was\r\nrushin' on with the rest when the captain called a halt.\r\n\r\n\"`You did that a purpose, you villain!' he said with a tremendous oath,\r\nand drawin' a pistol from his belt, let fly right into my breast.  I\r\nfell at once, and remembered no more till I was startled and brought\r\nround by the most awful yell I ever heard in my life--except, maybe, the\r\nshrieks o' them poor critters that were crushed to death under yon big\r\ncanoe.  Jumpin' up, I looked round, and through the trees saw a fire\r\ngleamin' not far off; the light of which showed me the captain and men\r\ntied hand and foot, each to a post, and the savages dancin' round them\r\nlike demons.  I had scarce looked for a second when I saw one o' them go\r\nup to the captain flourishing a knife, and before I could wink he\r\nplunged it into his breast, while another yell, like the one that roused\r\nme, rang upon my ear.  I didn't wait for more, but bounding up, went\r\ncrashing through the bushes into the woods.  The black fellows caught\r\nsight of me, however, but not in time to prevent me jumpin' into the\r\nboat, as you know.\"\r\n\r\nBill seemed to be much exhausted after this recital, and shuddered\r\nfrequently during the narrative; so I refrained from continuing the\r\nsubject at that time, and endeavoured to draw his mind to other things.\r\n\r\n\"But now, Bill,\" said I, \"it behoves us to think about the future, and\r\nwhat course of action we shall pursue.  Here we are, on the wide\r\nPacific, in a well-appointed schooner, which is our own--at least, no\r\none has a better claim to it than we have--and the world lies before us.\r\nMoreover, here comes a breeze, so we must make up our minds which way\r\nto steer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ralph, boy,\" said my companion, \"it matters not to me which way we go.\r\nI fear that my time is short now.  Go where you will; I'm content.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Bill, I think we had better steer to the Coral Island and\r\nsee what has become of my dear old comrades, Jack and Peterkin.  I\r\nbelieve the island has no name, but the captain once pointed it out to\r\nme on the chart, and I marked it afterwards; so, as we know pretty well\r\nour position just now, I think I can steer to it.  Then, as to working\r\nthe vessel, it is true I cannot hoist the sails single-handed, but\r\nluckily we have enough of sail set already; and if it should come on to\r\nblow a squall, I could at least drop the peaks of the main and fore\r\nsails, and clew them up partially without help, and throw her head close\r\ninto the wind, so as to keep her all shaking till the violence of the\r\nsquall is past.  And if we have continued light breezes, I'll rig up a\r\ncomplication of blocks and fix them to the topsail halyards, so that I\r\nshall be able to hoist the sails without help.  'Tis true I'll require\r\nhalf-a-day to hoist them, but we don't need to mind that.  Then I'll\r\nmake a sort of erection on deck to screen you from the sun, Bill; and if\r\nyou can only manage to sit beside the tiller and steer for two hours\r\nevery day, so as to let me get a nap, I'll engage to let you off duty\r\nall the rest of the twenty-four hours.  And if you don't feel able for\r\nsteering, I'll lash the helm and heave-to while I get you your\r\nbreakfasts and dinners; and so we'll manage famously, and soon reach the\r\nCoral Island.\"\r\n\r\nBill smiled faintly as I ran on in this strain.\r\n\r\n\"And what will you do,\" said he, \"if it comes on to blow a storm?\"\r\n\r\nThis question silenced me, while I considered what I should do in such a\r\ncase.  At length I laid my hand on his arm and said, \"Bill, when a man\r\nhas done all that he can do, he ought to leave the rest to God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh Ralph,\" said my companion in a faint voice, looking anxiously into\r\nmy face, \"I wish that I had the feelin's about God that you seem to\r\nhave, at this hour.  I'm dyin', Ralph; yet I, who have braved death a\r\nhundred times, am afraid to die.  I'm afraid to enter the next world.\r\nSomething within tells me there will be a reckoning when I go there.\r\nBut it's all over with me, Ralph.  I feel that there's no chance o' my\r\nbein' saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that, Bill,\" said I in deep compassion; \"don't say that.  I'm\r\nquite sure there's hope even for you, but I can't remember the words of\r\nthe Bible that make me think so.  Is there not a Bible on board, Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the last that was in the ship belonged to a poor boy that was taken\r\naboard against his will.  He died, poor lad--I think through\r\nill-treatment and fear.  After he was gone, the captain found his Bible\r\nand flung it overboard.\"\r\n\r\nI now reflected, with great sadness and self-reproach, on the way in\r\nwhich I had neglected my Bible, and it flashed across me that I was\r\nactually, in the sight of God, a greater sinner than this blood-stained\r\npirate; for, thought I, he tells me that he never read the Bible and was\r\nnever brought up to care for it, whereas I was carefully taught to read\r\nit by my own mother, and had read it daily as long as I possessed one,\r\nyet to so little purpose that I could not now call to mind a single text\r\nthat would meet this poor man's case and afford him the consolation he\r\nso much required.  I was much distressed, and taxed my memory for a long\r\ntime.  At last a text did flash into my mind, and I wondered much that I\r\nhad not thought of it before.\r\n\r\n\"Bill,\" said I in a low voice, \"`Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and\r\nthou shalt be saved.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Ralph, I've heard the missionaries say that before now; but what\r\ngood can it do me?  It's not for me, that; it's not for the likes o'\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nI knew not now what to say, for although I felt sure that that word was\r\nfor him as well as for me, I could not remember any other word whereby I\r\ncould prove it.\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, Bill raised his eyes to mine and said, \"Ralph, I've\r\nled a terrible life.  I've been a sailor since I was a boy, and I've\r\ngone from bad to worse ever since I left my father's roof.  I've been a\r\npirate three years now.  It is true I did not choose the trade, but I\r\nwas inveigled aboard this schooner and kept here by force till I became\r\nreckless and at last joined them.  Since that time my hand has been\r\nsteeped in human blood again and again.  Your young heart would grow\r\ncold if I--But why should I go on?  'Tis of no use, Ralph; my doom is\r\nfixed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bill,\" said I, \"`Though your sins be red like crimson, they shall be\r\nwhite as snow.'  Only believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only believe!\" cried Bill, starting up on his elbow.  \"I've heard men\r\ntalk o' believing as if it was easy.  Ha! 'tis easy enough for a man to\r\npoint to a rope and say, `I believe that would bear my weight;' but 'tis\r\nanother thing for a man to catch hold o' that rope and swing himself by\r\nit over the edge of a precipice!\"\r\n\r\nThe energy with which he said this, and the action with which it was\r\naccompanied, were too much for Bill.  He sank back with a deep groan.\r\nAs if the very elements sympathised with this man's sufferings, a low\r\nmoan came sweeping over the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Hist, Ralph!\" said Bill, opening his eyes; \"there's a squall coming,\r\nlad!  Look alive, boy!  Clew up the foresail!  Drop the mainsail peak!\r\nThem squalls come quick sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nI had already started to my feet, and saw that a heavy squall was indeed\r\nbearing down on us.  It had hitherto escaped my notice, owing to my\r\nbeing so much engrossed by our conversation.  I instantly did as Bill\r\ndesired, for the schooner was lying motionless on the glassy sea.  I\r\nobserved with some satisfaction that the squall was bearing down on the\r\nlarboard bow, so that it would strike the vessel in the position in\r\nwhich she would be best able to stand the shock.  Having done my best to\r\nshorten sail, I returned aft, and took my stand at the helm.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boy,\" said Bill in a faint voice, \"keep her close to the wind.\"\r\n\r\nA few seconds afterwards he said, \"Ralph, let me hear those two texts\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nI repeated them.\r\n\r\n\"Are ye sure, lad, ye saw them in the Bible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nAlmost before the words had left my lips the wind burst upon us, and the\r\nspray dashed over our decks.  For a time the schooner stood it bravely,\r\nand sprang forward against the rising sea like a war-horse.  Meanwhile\r\nclouds darkened the sky, and the sea began to rise in huge billows.\r\nThere was still too much sail on the schooner, and as the gale\r\nincreased, I feared that the masts would be torn out of her or carried\r\naway, while the wind whistled and shrieked through the strained rigging.\r\nSuddenly the wind shifted a point, a heavy sea struck us on the bow,\r\nand the schooner was almost laid on her beam-ends, so that I could\r\nscarcely keep my legs.  At the same moment Bill lost his hold of the\r\nbelaying-pin which had served to steady him, and he slid with stunning\r\nviolence against the skylight.  As he lay on the deck close beside me, I\r\ncould see that the shock had rendered him insensible; but I did not dare\r\nto quit the tiller for an instant, as it required all my faculties,\r\nbodily and mental, to manage the schooner.  For an hour the blast drove\r\nus along, while, owing to the sharpness of the vessel's bow and the\r\npress of canvas, she dashed through the waves instead of breasting over\r\nthem, thereby drenching the decks with water fore and aft.  At the end\r\nof that time the squall passed away, and left us rocking on the bosom of\r\nthe agitated sea.\r\n\r\nMy first care, the instant I could quit the helm, was to raise Bill from\r\nthe deck and place him on the couch.  I then ran below for the\r\nbrandy-bottle, and rubbed his face and hands with it, and endeavoured to\r\npour a little down his throat.  But my efforts, although I continued\r\nthem long and assiduously, were of no avail; as I let go the hand which\r\nI had been chafing, it fell heavily on the deck.  I laid my hand over\r\nhis heart, and sat for some time quite motionless; but there was no\r\nflutter there--the pirate was dead!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nALONE ON THE DEEP--NECESSITY THE MOTHER OF INVENTION--A VALUABLE BOOK\r\nDISCOVERED--NATURAL PHENOMENON--A BRIGHT DAY IN MY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nIt was with feelings of awe, not unmingled with fear, that I now seated\r\nmyself on the cabin skylight and gazed upon the rigid features of my\r\nlate comrade, while my mind wandered over his past history and\r\ncontemplated with anxiety my present position.  Alone in the midst of\r\nthe wide Pacific, having a most imperfect knowledge of navigation, and\r\nin a schooner requiring at least eight men as her proper crew!  But I\r\nwill not tax the reader's patience with a minute detail of my feelings\r\nand doings during the first few days that followed the death of my\r\ncompanion.  I will merely mention that I tied a cannon-ball to his feet,\r\nand with feelings of the deepest sorrow, consigned him to the deep.\r\n\r\nFor fully a week after that a steady breeze blew from the east, and as\r\nmy course lay west and by north, I made rapid progress towards my\r\ndestination.  I could not take an observation, which I very much\r\nregretted, as the captain's quadrant was in the cabin; but from the day\r\nof setting sail from the island of the savages I had kept a dead\r\nreckoning, and as I knew pretty well now how much leeway the schooner\r\nmade, I hoped to hit the Coral Island without much difficulty.  In this\r\nI was the more confident that I knew its position on the chart--which, I\r\nunderstood, was a very good one--and so had its correct bearings by\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nAs the weather seemed now quite settled and fine, and as I had got into\r\nthe trade-winds, I set about preparations for hoisting the topsails.\r\nThis was a most arduous task, and my first attempts were complete\r\nfailures, owing, in a great degree, to my reprehensible ignorance of\r\nmechanical forces.  The first error I made was in applying my apparatus\r\nof blocks and pulleys to a rope which was too weak, so that the very\r\nfirst heave I made broke it in two, and sent me staggering against the\r\nafter-hatch, over which I tripped, and striking against the main-boom,\r\ntumbled down the companion-ladder into the cabin.  I was much bruised\r\nand somewhat stunned by this untoward accident.  However, I considered\r\nit fortunate that I was not killed.  In my next attempt I made sure of\r\nnot coming by a similar accident, so I unreeved the tackling and fitted\r\nup larger blocks and ropes.  But although the principle on which I acted\r\nwas quiet correct, the machinery was now so massive and heavy that the\r\nmere friction and stiffness of the thick cordage prevented me from\r\nmoving it at all.  Afterwards, however, I came to proportion things more\r\ncorrectly; but I could not avoid reflecting at the time how much better\r\nit would have been had I learned all this from observation and study,\r\ninstead of waiting till I was forced to acquire it through the painful\r\nand tedious lessons of experience.\r\n\r\nAfter the tackling was prepared and in good working order, it took me\r\nthe greater part of a day to hoist the main topsail.  As I could not\r\nsteer and work at this at the same time, I lashed the helm in such a\r\nposition that, with a little watching now and then, it kept the schooner\r\nin her proper course.  By this means I was enabled, also, to go about\r\nthe deck and down below for things that I wanted as occasion required;\r\nalso to cook and eat my victuals.  But I did not dare to trust to this\r\nplan during the three hours of rest that I allowed myself at night, as\r\nthe wind might have shifted, in which case I should have been blown far\r\nout of my course ere I awoke.  I was, therefore, in the habit of\r\nheaving-to during those three hours--that is, fixing the rudder and the\r\nsails in such a position as that, by acting against each other, they\r\nwould keep the ship stationary.  After my night's rest, therefore, I had\r\nonly to make allowance for the leeway she had made, and so resume my\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nOf course I was, to some extent, anxious lest another squall should\r\ncome; but I made the best provision I could in the circumstances, and\r\nconcluded that by letting go the weather-braces of the topsails and the\r\ntopsail halyards at the same time, I should thereby render these sails\r\nalmost powerless.  Besides this, I proposed to myself to keep a sharp\r\nlookout on the barometer in the cabin; and if I observed at any time a\r\nsudden fall in it, I resolved that I would instantly set about my\r\nmultiform appliances for reducing sail, so as to avoid being taken\r\nunawares.  Thus I sailed prosperously for two weeks, with a fair wind,\r\nso that I calculated I must be drawing near to the Coral Island, at the\r\nthought of which my heart bounded with joyful expectation.\r\n\r\nThe only book I found on board, after a careful search, was a volume of\r\nCaptain Cook's voyages.  This, I suppose, the pirate captain had brought\r\nwith him in order to guide him, and to furnish him with information\r\nregarding the islands of these seas.  I found this a most delightful\r\nbook indeed; and I not only obtained much interesting knowledge about\r\nthe sea in which I was sailing, but I had many of my own opinions,\r\nderived from experience, corroborated, and not a few of them corrected.\r\nBesides the reading of this charming book, and the daily routine of\r\noccupations, nothing of particular note happened to me during this\r\nvoyage--except once, when on rising one night, after my three hours'\r\nnap, while it was yet dark, I was amazed and a little alarmed to find\r\nmyself floating in what appeared to be a sea of blue fire!  I had often\r\nnoticed the beautiful appearance of phosphorescent light, but this far\r\nexceeded anything of the sort I ever saw before.  The whole sea appeared\r\nsomewhat like milk, and was remarkably luminous.\r\n\r\nI rose in haste, and letting down a bucket into the sea, brought some of\r\nthe water on board and took it down to the cabin to examine it; but no\r\nsooner did I approach the light than the strange appearance disappeared,\r\nand when I removed the cabin lamp the luminous light appeared again.  I\r\nwas much puzzled with this, and took up a little of the water in the\r\nhollow of my hand and then let it run off, when I found that the\r\nluminous substance was left behind on my palm.  I ran with it to the\r\nlamp, but when I got there it was gone.  I found, however, that when I\r\nwent into the dark my hand shone again; so I took the large glass of the\r\nship's telescope and examined my hand minutely, when I found that there\r\nwere on it one or two small patches of a clear, transparent substance\r\nlike jelly, which were so thin as to be almost invisible to the naked\r\neye.  Thus I came to know that the beautiful phosphoric light, which I\r\nhad so often admired before, was caused by animals; for I had no doubt\r\nthat these were of the same kind as the medusa or jelly-fish, which are\r\nseen in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of my fourteenth day I was awakened out of a nap into\r\nwhich I had fallen by a loud cry, and starting up, I gazed around me.  I\r\nwas surprised and delighted to see a large albatross soaring\r\nmajestically over the ship.  I immediately took it into my head that\r\nthis was the albatross I had seen at Penguin Island.  I had, of course,\r\nno good reason for supposing this; but the idea occurred to me, I know\r\nnot why, and I cherished it, and regarded the bird with as much\r\naffection as if he had been an old friend.  He kept me company all that\r\nday, and left me as night fell.\r\n\r\nNext morning, as I stood motionless and with heavy eyes at the helm--for\r\nI had not slept well--I began to weary anxiously for daylight, and\r\npeered towards the horizon, where I thought I observed something like a\r\nblack cloud against the dark sky.  Being always on the alert for\r\nsqualls, I ran to the bow.  There could be no doubt it was a squall, and\r\nas I listened I thought I heard the murmur of the coming gale.\r\nInstantly I began to work might and main at my cumbrous tackle for\r\nshortening sail, and in the course of an hour and a half had the most of\r\nit reduced--the topsail yards down on the caps, the topsails clewed up,\r\nthe sheets hauled in, the main and fore peaks lowered, and the\r\nflying-jib down.  While thus engaged, the dawn advanced, and I cast an\r\noccasional furtive glance ahead in the midst of my labour.  But now that\r\nthings were prepared for the worst, I ran forward again and looked\r\nanxiously over the bow.  I now heard the roar of the waves distinctly;\r\nand as a single ray of the rising sun gleamed over the ocean, I saw--\r\nwhat! could it be that I was dreaming?--that magnificent breaker with\r\nits ceaseless roar--that mountain-top!  Yes, once more I beheld the\r\nCoral Island!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF A CANNON-SHOT--A HAPPY REUNION OF A SOMEWHAT MOIST\r\nNATURE--RETROSPECT AND EXPLANATIONS--AN AWFUL DIVE--NEW PLANS--THE LAST\r\nOF THE CORAL ISLAND.\r\n\r\nI almost fell upon the deck with the tumult of mingled emotions that\r\nfilled my heart as I gazed ardently towards my beautiful island.  It was\r\nstill many miles away, but sufficiently near to enable me to trace\r\ndistinctly the well-remembered outlines of the two mountains.  My first\r\nimpulse was to utter an exclamation of gratitude for being carried to my\r\nformer happy home in safety; my second, to jump up, clap my hands,\r\nshout, and run up and down the deck, with no other object in view than\r\nthat of giving vent to my excited feelings.  Then I went below for the\r\ntelescope, and spent nearly ten minutes of the utmost impatience in\r\nvainly trying to get a focus, and in rubbing the skin nearly off my\r\neyes, before I discovered that having taken off the large glass to\r\nexamine the phosphoric water with, I had omitted to put it on again.\r\n\r\nAfter that I looked up impatiently at the sails, which I now regretted\r\nhaving lowered so hastily, and for a moment thought of hoisting the main\r\ntopsail again; but recollecting that it would take me full half-a-day to\r\naccomplish, and that, at the present rate of sailing, two hours would\r\nbring me to the island, I immediately dismissed the idea.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the time I spent in making feverish preparations for\r\narriving and seeing my dear comrades.  I remembered that they were not\r\nin the habit of rising before six, and as it was now only three, I hoped\r\nto arrive before they were awake.  Moreover, I set about making ready to\r\nlet go the anchor, resolving in my own mind that as I knew the depth of\r\nwater in the passage of the reef and within the lagoon, I would run the\r\nschooner in and bring up opposite the bower.  Fortunately the anchor was\r\nhanging at the cat-head, otherwise I should never have been able to use\r\nit.  Now I had only to cut the tackling, and it would drop of its own\r\nweight.  After searching among the flags, I found the terrible black\r\none, which I ran up to the peak.  While I was doing this a thought\r\nstruck me.  I went to the powder-magazine, brought up a blank cartridge,\r\nand loaded the big brass gun, which, it will be remembered, was unhoused\r\nwhen we set sail; and as I had no means of housing it, there it had\r\nstood, bristling alike at fair weather and foul all the voyage.  I took\r\ncare to grease its mouth well, and before leaving the fore part of the\r\nship, thrust the poker into the fire.\r\n\r\nAll was now ready.  A steady five-knot breeze was blowing, so that I was\r\nnow not more than quarter of a mile from the reef.  I was soon at the\r\nentrance; and as the schooner glided quickly through, I glanced\r\naffectionately at the huge breaker as if it had been the same one I had\r\nseen there when I bade adieu, as I feared for ever, to the island.  On\r\ncoming opposite the Water Garden, I put the helm hard down.  The\r\nschooner came round with a rapid, graceful bend, and lost way just\r\nopposite the bower.  Running forward, I let go the anchor, caught up the\r\nred-hot poker, applied it to the brass gun, and saluted the mountains\r\nwith a _bang_ such as had only once before broke their slumbering\r\nechoes!\r\n\r\nEffective although it was, however, it was scarcely equal to the bang\r\nwith which, instantly after, Peterkin bounded from the bower, in scanty\r\ncostume, his eyeballs starting from his head with surprise and terror.\r\nOne gaze he gave, one yell, and then fled into the bushes like a wild\r\ncat.  The next moment Jack went through exactly the same performance,\r\nthe only difference being that his movements were less like those of\r\nJack-in-the-box, though not less vigorous and rapid than those of\r\nPeterkin.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\"  I shouted, almost mad with joy.  \"What ho!  Peterkin!  Jack!\r\nhallo! it's _me_!\"\r\n\r\nMy shout was just in time to arrest them.  They halted and turned round,\r\nand the instant I repeated the cry I saw that they recognised my voice\r\nby both of them running at full speed towards the beach.  I could no\r\nlonger contain myself.  Throwing off my jacket, I jumped overboard at\r\nthe same moment that Jack bounded into the sea.  In other moment we met\r\nin deep water, clasped each other round the neck, and sank, as a matter\r\nof course, to the bottom!  We were well-nigh choked, and instantly\r\nstruggled to the surface, where Peterkin was spluttering about like a\r\nwounded duck, laughing and crying by turns, and choking himself with\r\nsalt water!\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to convey to my reader, by description, an\r\nadequate conception of the scene that followed my landing on the beach,\r\nas we stood embracing each other indiscriminately in our dripping\r\ngarments, and giving utterance to incoherent rhapsodies, mingled with\r\nwild shouts.  It can be more easily imagined than described; so I will\r\ndraw a curtain over this part of my history, and carry the reader\r\nforward over an interval of three days.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of that period Peterkin did nothing but roast\r\npigs, taro, and bread-fruit, and ply me with plantains, plums, potatoes,\r\nand cocoa-nuts, while I related to him and Jack the terrible and\r\nwonderful adventures I had gone through since we last met.  After I had\r\nfinished the account, they made me go all over it again; and when I had\r\nconcluded the second recital I had to go over it again, while they\r\ncommented upon it piecemeal.  They were much affected by what I told\r\nthem of the probable fate of Avatea, and Peterkin could by no means\r\nbrook the idea of the poor girl being converted into a _long pig_!  As\r\nfor Jack, he clenched his teeth, and shook his fist towards the sea,\r\nsaying at the same time that he was sorry he had not broken Tararo's\r\nhead, and he only hoped that one day he should be able to plant his\r\nknuckles on the bridge of that chief's nose!  After they had `pumped me\r\ndry,' as Peterkin said, I begged to be informed of what had happened to\r\nthem during my long absence, and particularly as to how they got out of\r\nthe Diamond Cave.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you must know,\" began Jack, \"after you had dived out of the cave,\r\non the day you were taken away from us, we waited very patiently for\r\nhalf-an-hour, not expecting you to return before the end of that time.\r\nThen we began to upbraid you for staying so long when you knew we would\r\nbe anxious; but when an hour passed we became alarmed, and I resolved at\r\nall hazards to dive out and see what had become of you, although I felt\r\nfor poor Peterkin, because, as he truly said, `If you never come back,\r\nI'm shut up here for life.'  However, I promised not to run any risk,\r\nand he let me go--which, to say truth, I thought very courageous of\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should just think it was,\" interrupted Peterkin, looking at Jack over\r\nthe edge of a monstrous potato which he happened to be devouring at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Jack, \"you may guess my consternation when you did not\r\nanswer to my halloo.  At first I imagined that the pirates must have\r\nkilled you, and left you in the bush or thrown you into the sea; then it\r\noccurred to me that this would have served no end of theirs, so I came\r\nto the conclusion that they must have carried you away with them.  As\r\nthis thought struck me, I observed the pirate schooner standing away to\r\nthe nor'ard, almost hull down on the horizon, and I sat down on the\r\nrocks to watch her as she slowly sank from my sight.  And I tell you,\r\nRalph, my boy, that I shed more tears that time at losing you than I\r\nhave done, I verily believe, all my life before--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Jack, for interrupting,\" said Peterkin; \"surely you must be\r\nmistaken in that.  You've often told me that when you were a baby you\r\nused to howl and roar from morning to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, Peterkin!\" cried Jack.--\"Well, after the schooner had\r\ndisappeared, I dived back into the cave, much to Peterkin's relief, and\r\ntold him what I had seen.  We sat down and had a long talk over this\r\nmatter, and then we agreed to make a regular, systematic search through\r\nthe woods, so as to make sure at least that you had not been killed.\r\nBut now we thought of the difficulty of getting out of the cave without\r\nyour help.  Peterkin became dreadfully nervous when he thought of this;\r\nand I must confess I felt some alarm, for, of course, I could not hope\r\nalone to take him out so quickly as we two together had brought him in.\r\nAnd he himself vowed that if we had been a moment longer with him that\r\ntime, he would have had to take a breath of salt water.  However, there\r\nwas no help for it, and I endeavoured to calm his fears as well as I\r\ncould; `for,' said I, `you can't live here, Peterkin,' to which he\r\nreplied, `Of course not, Jack; I can only die here, and as that's not at\r\nall desirable, you had better propose something.'  So I suggested that\r\nhe should take a good, long breath, and trust himself to me.\r\n\r\n\"`Might we not make a large bag of cocoa-nut cloth, into which I could\r\nshove my head, and tie it tight round my neck?' he asked with a haggard\r\nsmile.  `It might let me get one breath under water!'\r\n\r\n\"`No use,' said I; `it would fill in a moment and suffocate you.  I see\r\nnothing for it, Peterkin, if you really can't keep your breath so long,\r\nbut to let me knock you down, and carry you out while in a state of\r\ninsensibility.'\r\n\r\n\"But Peterkin didn't relish this idea.  He seemed to fear that I would\r\nnot be able to measure the exact force of the blow, and might, on the\r\none hand, hit him so softly as to render a second or third blow\r\nnecessary, which would be very uncomfortable; or, on the other hand,\r\ngive him such a smash as would entirely spoil his figurehead, or mayhap\r\nknock the life out of him altogether!  At last I got him persuaded to\r\ntry to hold his breath, and commit himself to me; so he agreed, and down\r\nwe went.  But I had not got half-way through when he began to struggle\r\nand kick like a wild bull, burst from my grasp, and hit against the roof\r\nof the tunnel.  I was therefore obliged to force him violently back into\r\nthe cave again, where he, rose panting to the surface.  In short, he had\r\nlost his presence of mind, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the sort!\" cried Peterkin indignantly; \"I only lost my wind,\r\nand if I had not had presence of mind enough to kick as I did, I should\r\nhave bu'st in your arms!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, so be it,\" resumed Jack with a smile.--\"But the upshot of\r\nit was that we had to hold another consultation on the point; and I\r\nreally believe that had it not been for a happy thought of mine, we\r\nshould have been consulting there yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had!\" again interrupted Peterkin with a sigh.--\"I'm sure,\r\nRalph, if I had thought that you were coming back again I would\r\nwillingly have awaited your return for months rather than have endured\r\nthe mental agony which I went through.--But proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The thought was this,\" continued Jack--\"that I should tie Peterkin's\r\nhands and feet with cords, and then lash him firmly to a stout pole\r\nabout five feet long, in order to render him quite powerless and keep\r\nhim straight and stiff.  You should have seen his face of horror, Ralph,\r\nwhen I suggested this!  But he came to see that it was his only chance,\r\nand told me to set about it as fast as I could; `for,' said he, `this is\r\nno jokin', Jack, _I_ can tell you, and the sooner it's done the better.'\r\nI soon procured the cordage and a suitable pole, with which I returned\r\nto the cave, and lashed him as stiff and straight as an Egyptian mummy;\r\nand, to say truth, he was no bad representation of what an English mummy\r\nwould be, if there were such things, for he was as white as a dead man.\r\n\r\n\"`Now,' said Peterkin in a tremulous voice, `swim with me as near to the\r\nedge of the hole as you can before you dive; then let me take a long\r\nbreath; and as I sha'n't be able to speak after I've taken it, you'll\r\nwatch my face, and the moment you see me wink--dive!  And oh,' he added\r\nearnestly, `pray don't be long!'\r\n\r\n\"I promised to pay the strictest attention to his wishes, and swam with\r\nhim to the outlet of the cave.  Here I paused.  `Now, then,' said I,\r\n`pull away at the wind, lad.'\r\n\r\n\"Peterkin drew in a breath so long that I could not help thinking of the\r\nfrog in the fable, that wanted to swell itself as big as the ox.  Then I\r\nlooked into his face earnestly.  Slap went the lid of his right eye;\r\ndown went my head, and up went my heels.  We shot through the passage\r\nlike an arrow, and rose to the surface of the open sea before you could\r\ncount twenty.\r\n\r\n\"Peterkin had taken in such an awful load of wind that, on reaching the\r\nfree air, he let it out with a yell loud enough to have been heard a\r\nmile off; and then the change in his feelings was so sudden and great\r\nthat he did not wait till we landed, but began, tied up as he was, to\r\nshout and sing for joy as I supported him with my left arm to the shore.\r\nHowever, in the middle of a laugh that a hyena might have envied, I let\r\nhim accidentally slip, which extinguished him in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"After this happy deliverance, we immediately began our search for your\r\ndead body, Ralph; and you have no idea how low our hearts sank as we set\r\noff; day after day, to examine the valleys and mountain-sides with the\r\nutmost care.  In about three weeks we completed the survey of the whole\r\nisland, and had at least the satisfaction of knowing that you had not\r\nbeen killed.  But it occurred to us that you might have been thrown into\r\nthe sea; so we examined the sands and the lagoon carefully, and\r\nafterwards went all round the outer reef.  One day, while we were upon\r\nthe reef, Peterkin espied a small, dark object lying among the rocks,\r\nwhich seemed to be quite different from the surrounding stones.  We\r\nhastened towards the spot, and found it to be a small keg.  On knocking\r\nout the head we discovered that it was gunpowder.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was I who sent you that, Jack,\" said I with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Fork out!\" cried Peterkin energetically, starting to his feet and\r\nextending his open hand to Jack.  \"Down with the money, sir, else I'll\r\nhave you shut up for life in a debtor's prison the moment we return to\r\nEngland!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you an I.O.U. in the meantime,\" returned Jack, laughing, \"so\r\nsit down and be quiet.--The fact is, Ralph, when we discovered this keg\r\nof powder Peterkin immediately took me a bet of a thousand pounds that\r\nyou had something to do with it, and I took him a bet of ten thousand\r\nthat you had not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peterkin was right, then,\" said I, explaining how the thing had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we found it very useful,\" continued Jack, \"although some of it\r\nhad got a little damp; and we furbished up the old pistol, with which\r\nPeterkin is a crack shot now.  But to continue.  We did not find any\r\nother vestige of you on the reef, and finally gave up all hope of ever\r\nseeing you again.  After this the island became a dreary place to us,\r\nand we began to long for a ship to heave in sight and take us off.  But\r\nnow that you're back again, my dear fellow, it looks as bright and\r\ncheerful as it used to do, and I love it as much as ever.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" continued Jack, \"I have a great desire to visit some of the\r\nother islands of the South Seas.  Here we have a first-rate schooner at\r\nour disposal, so I don't see what should hinder us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the very thing I was going to propose!\" cried Peterkin.  \"I vote\r\nfor starting at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Jack, \"it seems to me that we could not do better\r\nthan shape our course for the island on which Avatea lives, and\r\nendeavour to persuade Tararo to let her marry the black fellow to whom\r\nshe is engaged instead of making a `long pig' of her.  If he has a spark\r\nof gratitude in him, he'll do it.  Besides, having become champions for\r\nthis girl once before, it behoves us, as true knights, not to rest until\r\nwe set her free; at least, all the heroes in all the story-books I have\r\never read would count it foul disgrace to leave such a work unfinished.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know or care what your knights in story-books would\r\ndo,\" said Peterkin; \"but I'm certain that it would be capital fun, so\r\nI'm your man whenever you want me.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan of Jack's was quite in accordance with his romantic, impulsive\r\nnature; and having made up his mind to save this black girl, he could\r\nnot rest until the thing was commenced.\r\n\r\n\"But there may be great danger in this attempt,\" he said at the end of a\r\nlong consultation on the subject.  \"Will you, lads, go with me in spite\r\nof this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go with you!\" we repeated in the same breath.\r\n\r\n\"Can you doubt it?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"For a moment?\" added Peterkin.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that having made up our minds to go on this\r\nenterprise, we lost no time in making preparations to quit the island;\r\nand as the schooner was well laden with stores of every kind for a long\r\ncruise, we had little to do except to add to our abundant supply a\r\nquantity of cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, taro, yams, plums, and potatoes,\r\nchiefly with the view of carrying the fragrance of our dear island along\r\nwith us as long as we could.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, we paid a farewell visit to the different familiar\r\nspots where most of our time had been spent.  We ascended the\r\nmountain-top, and gazed for the last time at the rich green foliage in\r\nthe valleys, the white sandy beach, the placid lagoon, and the barrier\r\ncoral reef with its crested breakers.  Then we descended to Spouting\r\nCliff, and looked down at the pale-green monster which we had made such\r\nfruitless efforts to spear in days gone by.  From this we hurried to the\r\nWater Garden, and took a last dive into its clear waters and a last\r\ngambol amongst its coral groves.  I hurried out before my companions,\r\nand dressed in haste, in order to have a long examination of my tank,\r\nwhich Peterkin, in the fulness of his heart, had tended with the utmost\r\ncare, as being a vivid remembrancer of me rather than out of love for\r\nnatural history.  It was in superb condition: the water as clear and\r\npellucid as crystal; the red and green seaweed of the most brilliant\r\nhues; the red, purple, yellow, green, and striped anemones fully\r\nexpanded, and stretching out their arms as if to welcome and embrace\r\ntheir former master; the starfish, zoophytes, sea-pens, and other\r\ninnumerable marine insects, looking fresh and beautiful; and the crabs,\r\nas Peterkin said, looking as wide-awake, impertinent, rampant, and\r\npugnacious as ever.  It was, indeed, so lovely and so interesting that I\r\nwould scarcely allow myself to be torn away from it.\r\n\r\nLast of all, we returned to the bower and collected the few articles we\r\npossessed--such as the axe, the pencil-case, the broken telescope, the\r\npenknife, the hook made from the brass ring, and the sail-needle, with\r\nwhich we had landed on the island; also the long boots and the pistol,\r\nbesides several curious articles of costume which we had manufactured\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nThese we conveyed on board in our little boat, after having carved our\r\nnames on a chip of iron-wood, thus:\r\n\r\n                              JACK MARTIN\r\n                              RALPH ROVER\r\n                             PETERKIN GAY\r\n\r\nThis we fixed up inside of the bower.  The boat was then hoisted on\r\nboard and the anchor weighed, which latter operation cost us great\r\nlabour and much time, as the anchor was so heavy that we could not move\r\nit without the aid of my complex machinery of blocks and pulleys.  A\r\nsteady breeze was blowing off-shore when we set sail, at a little before\r\nsunset.  It swept us quickly past the reef and out to sea.  The shore\r\ngrew rapidly more indistinct as the shades of evening fell, while our\r\nclipper bark bounded lightly over the waves.  Slowly the mountain-top\r\nsank on the horizon until it became a mere speck.  In another moment the\r\nsun and the Coral Island sank together into the broad bosom of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE--THE ISLAND, AND A CONSULTATION IN WHICH DANGER IS SCOUTED AS\r\nA THING UNWORTHY OF CONSIDERATION--RATS AND CATS--THE NATIVE TEACHER--\r\nAWFUL REVELATIONS--WONDERFUL EFFECTS OF CHRISTIANITY.\r\n\r\nOur voyage during the next two weeks was most interesting and\r\nprosperous.  The breeze continued generally fair, and at all times\r\nenabled us to lie our course; for being, as I have said before,\r\nclipper-built, the pirate schooner could lie very close to the wind and\r\nmake little leeway.  We had no difficulty now in managing our sails, for\r\nJack was heavy and powerful, while Peterkin was active as a kitten.\r\nStill, however, we were a very insufficient crew for such a vessel; and\r\nif any one had proposed to us to make such a voyage in it before we had\r\nbeen forced to go through so many hardships from necessity, we would\r\nhave turned away with pity from the individual making such proposal as\r\nfrom a madman.  I pondered this a good deal, and at last concluded that\r\nmen do not know how much they are capable of doing till they try, and\r\nthat we should never give way to despair in any undertaking, however\r\ndifficult it may seem--always supposing, however, that our cause is a\r\ngood one, and that we can ask the Divine blessing on it.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, we could now manage our sails easily, we\r\nnevertheless found that my pulleys were of much service to us in some\r\nthings, though Jack did laugh heartily at the uncouth arrangement of\r\nropes and blocks, which had, to a sailor's eye, a very lumbering and\r\nclumsy appearance.  But I will not drag my reader through the details of\r\nthis voyage.  Suffice it to say that, after an agreeable sail of about\r\nthree weeks, we arrived off the island of Mango, which I recognised at\r\nonce from the description that the pirate Bill had given me of it during\r\none of our conversations.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we came within sight of it, we hove the ship to and held a\r\ncouncil of war.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys,\" said Jack as we seated ourselves beside him on the cabin\r\nskylight, \"before we go further in this business we must go over the\r\npros and cons of it; for although you have so generously consented to\r\nstick by me through thick and thin, it would be unfair did I not see\r\nthat you thoroughly understand the danger of what we are about to\r\nattempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother the danger!\" cried Peterkin.  \"I wonder to hear you, Jack,\r\ntalk of danger!  When a fellow begins to talk about it, he'll soon come\r\nto magnify it to such a degree that he'll not be fit to face it when it\r\ncomes--no more than a suckin' baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Peterkin,\" replied Jack gravely, \"I won't be jested out of it.  I\r\ngrant you that when we've once resolved to act, and have made up our\r\nminds what to do, we should think no more of danger.  But before we have\r\nso resolved, it behoves us to look it straight in the face, and examine\r\ninto it, and walk round it; for if we flinch at a distant view, we're\r\nsure to run away when the danger is near.--Now, I understand from you,\r\nRalph, that the island is inhabited by thorough-going, out-and-out\r\ncannibals, whose principal law is, `Might is right, and the weakest goes\r\nto the wall?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I; \"so Bill gave me to understand.  He told me, however,\r\nthat at the southern side of it the missionaries had obtained a footing\r\namongst an insignificant tribe.  A native teacher had been sent there by\r\nthe Wesleyans, who had succeeded in persuading the chief at that part to\r\nembrace Christianity.  But instead of that being of any advantage to our\r\nenterprise, it seems the very reverse; for the chief Tararo is a\r\ndetermined heathen, and persecutes the Christians--who are far too weak\r\nin numbers to offer any resistance--and looks with dislike upon all\r\nwhite men, whom he regards as propagators of the new faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a pity,\" said Jack, \"that the Christian tribe is so small, for we\r\nshall scarcely be safe under their protection, I fear.  If Tararo takes\r\nit into his head to wish for our vessel, or to kill ourselves, he could\r\ntake us from them by force.  You say that the native missionary talks\r\nEnglish?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, what I propose is this,\" said Jack.  \"We will run round to the\r\nsouth side of the island, and cast anchor off the Christian village.  We\r\nare too far away just now to have been descried by any of the savages,\r\nso we shall get there unobserved, and have time to arrange our plans\r\nbefore the heathen tribes know of our presence.  But in doing this we\r\nrun the risk of being captured by the ill-disposed tribes, and being\r\nvery ill-used, if not--a--\"\r\n\r\n\"Roasted alive and eaten!\" cried Peterkin.  \"Come, out with it, Jack!\r\nAccording to your own showing, it's well to look the danger straight in\r\nthe face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that _is_ the worst of it, certainly.  Are you prepared, then, to\r\ntake your chance of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been prepared and had my mind made up long ago,\" cried Peterkin,\r\nswaggering about the deck with his hands thrust into his breeches\r\npockets.  \"The fact is, Jack, I don't believe that Tararo will be so\r\nungrateful as to eat us, and I'm quite sure that he'll be too happy to\r\ngrant us whatever we ask; so the sooner we go in and win the better.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin was wrong, however, in his estimate of savage gratitude, as the\r\nsequel will show.\r\n\r\nThe schooner was now put before the wind, and after making a long run to\r\nthe southward, we put about and beat up for the south side of Mango,\r\nwhere we arrived before sunset, and hove-to off the coral reef.  Here we\r\nawaited the arrival of a canoe, which immediately put off on our\r\nrounding-to.  When it arrived, a mild-looking native, of apparently\r\nforty years of age, came on board, and taking off his straw hat, made us\r\na low bow.  He was clad in a respectable suit of European clothes; and\r\nthe first words he uttered, as he stepped up to Jack and shook hands\r\nwith him, were:\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, gentlemen.  We are happy to see you at Mango.  You are\r\nheartily welcome.\"\r\n\r\nAfter returning his salutation, Jack exclaimed, \"You must be the native\r\nmissionary teacher of whom I have heard--are you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.  I have the joy to be a servant of the Lord Jesus at this\r\nstation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the very man I want to see, then,\" replied Jack; \"that's lucky.\r\nCome down to the cabin, friend, and have a glass of wine.  I wish\r\nparticularly to speak with you.  My men there\"--pointing to Peterkin and\r\nme--\"will look after your people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said the teacher as he followed Jack to the cabin; \"I do\r\nnot drink wine or any strong drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! then there's lots of water, and you can have biscuit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, 'pon my word, that's cool!\" said Peterkin; \"his _men_, forsooth!\r\nWell, since we are to be men, we may as well come it as strong over\r\nthese black chaps as we can.--Hallo, there!\" he cried to the half-dozen\r\nof natives who stood upon the deck, gazing in wonder at all they saw,\r\n\"here's for you;\" and he handed them a tray of broken biscuit and a can\r\nof water.  Then thrusting his hands into his pockets, he walked up and\r\ndown the deck with an enormous swagger, whistling vociferously.\r\n\r\nIn about half-an-hour Jack and the teacher came on deck, and the latter,\r\nbidding us a cheerful good-evening, entered his canoe and paddled to the\r\nshore.  When he was gone, Peterkin stepped up to Jack, and touching his\r\ncap, said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, captain, have you any communications to make to your _men_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" cried Jack: \"ready about, mind the helm, and clew up your tongue,\r\nwhile I con the schooner through the passage in the reef.  The teacher,\r\nwho seems a first-rate fellow, says it's quite deep, and good anchorage\r\nwithin the lagoon close to the shore.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the vessel was slowly advancing to her anchorage, under a light\r\nbreeze, Jack explained to us that Avatea was still on the island, living\r\namongst the heathens; that she had expressed a strong desire to join the\r\nChristians; but Tararo would not let her, and kept her constantly in\r\nclose confinement.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" continued Jack, \"I find that she belongs to one of the\r\nSamoan Islands, where Christianity had been introduced long before her\r\ncapture by the heathens of a neighbouring island; and the very day after\r\nshe was taken she was to have joined the church which had been planted\r\nthere by that excellent body, the London Missionary Society.  The\r\nteacher tells me, too, that the poor girl has fallen in love with a\r\nChristian chief, who lives on an island some fifty miles or so to the\r\nsouth of this one, and that she is meditating a desperate attempt at\r\nescape.  So, you see, we have come in the nick of time.--I fancy that\r\nthis chief is the fellow whom you heard of, Ralph, at the island of\r\nEmo.--Besides all this, the heathen savages are at war among themselves,\r\nand there's to be a battle fought the day after to-morrow, in which the\r\nprincipal leader is Tararo; so that we'll not be able to commence our\r\nnegotiations with the rascally chief till the day after.\"\r\n\r\nThe village off which we anchored was beautifully situated at the head\r\nof a small bay, from the margin of which trees of every description\r\npeculiar to the tropics rose in the richest luxuriance to the summit of\r\na hilly ridge, which was the line of demarcation between the possessions\r\nof the Christians and those of the neighbouring heathen chief.\r\n\r\nThe site of the settlement was an extensive plot of flat land,\r\nstretching in a gentle slope from the sea to the mountain.  The cottages\r\nstood several hundred yards from the beach, and were protected from the\r\nglare of the sea by the rich foliage of rows of large Barringtonia and\r\nother trees which girt the shore.  The village was about a mile in\r\nlength, and perfectly straight, with a wide road down the middle, on\r\neither side of which were rows of the tufted-topped ti-tree, whose\r\ndelicate and beautiful blossoms, hanging beneath their plume-crested\r\ntops, added richness to the scene.  The cottages of the natives were\r\nbuilt beneath these trees, and were kept in the most excellent order,\r\neach having a little garden in front, tastefully laid out and planted,\r\nwhile the walks were covered with black and white pebbles.\r\n\r\nEvery house had doors and Venetian windows, painted partly with\r\nlamp-black made from the candle-nut, and partly with red ochre, which\r\ncontrasted powerfully with the dazzling coral lime that covered the\r\nwalls.  On a prominent position stood a handsome church, which was quite\r\na curiosity in its way.  It was a hundred feet long by fifty broad, and\r\nwas seated throughout to accommodate upwards of two thousand persons.\r\nIt had six large folding-doors, and twelve windows with Venetian blinds;\r\nand although a large and substantial edifice, it had been built, we were\r\ntold by the teacher: in the space of two months!  There was not a single\r\niron nail in the fabric, and the natives had constructed it chiefly with\r\ntheir stone and bone axes and other tools, having only one or two axes\r\nor tools of European manufacture.  Everything around this beautiful spot\r\nwore an aspect of peace and plenty; and as we dropped our anchor within\r\na stone's-cast of the substantial coral wharf, I could not avoid\r\ncontrasting it with the wretched village of Emo, where I had witnessed\r\nso many frightful scenes.  When the teacher afterwards told me that the\r\npeople of this tribe had become converts only a year previous to our\r\narrival, and that they had been living before that in the practice of\r\nthe most bloody system of idolatry, I could not refrain from exclaiming,\r\n\"What a convincing proof that Christianity is of God!\"\r\n\r\nOn landing from our little boat we were received with a warm welcome by\r\nthe teacher and his wife, the latter being also a native, clothed in a\r\nsimple European gown and a straw bonnet.  The shore was lined with\r\nhundreds of natives, whose persons were all more or less clothed with\r\nnative cloth.  Some of the men had on a kind of poncho formed of this\r\ncloth, their legs being uncovered; others wore clumsily fashioned\r\ntrousers, and no upper garment except hats made of straw and cloth.\r\nMany of the dresses, both of women and men, were grotesque enough, being\r\nvery bad imitations of the European garb; but all wore a dress of some\r\nsort or other.  They seemed very glad to see us, and crowded round us as\r\nthe teacher led the way to his dwelling, where we were entertained, in\r\nthe most sumptuous manner, on baked pig and all the varieties of fruits\r\nand vegetables that the island produced.  We were much annoyed, however,\r\nby the rats: they seemed to run about the house like domestic animals.\r\nAs we sat at table, one of them peeped up at us over the edge of the\r\ncloth, close to Peterkin's elbow, who floored it with a blow on the\r\nsnout from his knife, exclaiming as he did so:\r\n\r\n\"I say, Mister Teacher, why don't you set traps for these brutes?\r\nSurely you are not fond of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the teacher with a smile.  \"We would be glad to get rid of\r\nthem if we could; but if we were to trap all the rats on the island, it\r\nwould occupy our whole time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they, then, so numerous?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"They swarm everywhere.  The poor heathens on the north side eat them,\r\nand think them very sweet.  So did my people formerly; but they do not\r\neat so many now, because the missionary who was last here expressed\r\ndisgust at it.  The poor people asked if it was wrong to eat rats; and\r\nhe told them that it was certainly not wrong, but that the people of\r\nEngland would be much disgusted were they asked to eat rats.\"\r\n\r\nWe had not been an hour in the house of this kind-hearted man when we\r\nwere convinced of the truth of his statement as to their numbers; for\r\nthe rats ran about the floors in dozens, and during our meal two men\r\nwere stationed at the table to keep them off!\r\n\r\n\"What a pity you have no cats!\" said Peterkin; and he aimed a blow at\r\nanother reckless intruder, and missed it.\r\n\r\n\"We would indeed be glad to have a few,\" rejoined the teacher, \"but they\r\nare difficult to be got.  The hogs, we find, are very good rat-killers;\r\nbut they do not seem to be able to keep the numbers down.  I have heard\r\nthat they are better than cats.\"\r\n\r\nAs the teacher said this, his good-natured black face was wrinkled with\r\na smile of merriment.  Observing that I had noticed it, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I smiled just now when I remembered the fate of the first cat that was\r\ntaken to Rarotonga.  This is one of the stations of the London\r\nMissionary Society.  It, like our own, is infested with rats, and a cat\r\nwas brought at last to the island.  It was a large black one.  On being\r\nturned loose, instead of being content to stay among men, the cat took\r\nto the mountains and lived in a wild state, sometimes paying visits\r\nduring the night to the houses of the natives; some of whom, living at a\r\ndistance from the settlement, had not heard of the cat's arrival, and\r\nwere dreadfully frightened in consequence, calling it a `monster of the\r\ndeep,' and flying in terror away from it.  One night the cat--feeling a\r\ndesire for company, I suppose--took its way to the house of a chief who\r\nhad recently been converted to Christianity, and had begun to learn to\r\nread and pray.  The chief's wife, who was sitting awake at his side\r\nwhile he slept, beheld with horror two fires glistening in the doorway,\r\nand heard with surprise a mysterious voice.  Almost petrified with fear,\r\nshe awoke her husband, and began to upbraid him for forsaking his old\r\nreligion and burning his god, who, she declared, was now come to be\r\navenged of them.  `Get up and pray! get up and pray!' she cried.  The\r\nchief arose, and on opening his eyes, beheld the same glaring lights and\r\nheard the same ominous sound.  Impelled by the extreme urgency of the\r\ncase, he commenced, with all possible vehemence, to vociferate the\r\nalphabet, as a prayer to God to deliver them from the vengeance of\r\nSatan!  On hearing this, the cat, as much alarmed as themselves, fled\r\nprecipitately away, leaving the chief and his wife congratulating\r\nthemselves on the efficacy of their prayer.\"\r\n\r\nWe were much diverted with this anecdote, which the teacher related in\r\nEnglish so good that we certainly could not have supposed him a native\r\nbut for the colour of his face and the foreign accent in his tone.  Next\r\nday we walked out with this interesting man, and were much entertained\r\nand instructed by his conversation as we rambled through the cool, shady\r\ngroves of bananas, citrons, limes, and other trees, or sauntered among\r\nthe cottages of the natives, and watched them while they laboured\r\ndiligently in the taro-beds or manufactured the tapa, or native cloth.\r\nTo some of these Jack put questions, through the medium of the\r\nmissionary; and the replies were such as to surprise us at the extent of\r\ntheir knowledge.  Indeed, Peterkin very truly remarked that \"they seemed\r\nto know a considerable deal more than Jack himself!\"\r\n\r\nAmong other pieces of interesting information that we obtained was the\r\nfollowing, in regard to coral formations:\r\n\r\n\"The islands of the Pacific,\" said our friend, \"are of three different\r\nkinds or classes.  Those of the first class are volcanic, mountainous,\r\nand wild--some shooting their jagged peaks into the clouds at an\r\nelevation of ten and fifteen thousand feet.  Those of the second class\r\nare of crystallised limestone, and vary in height from one hundred to\r\nfive hundred feet.  The hills on these are not so wild or broken as\r\nthose of the first class, but are richly clothed with vegetation, and\r\nvery beautiful.  I have no doubt that the Coral Island on which you were\r\nwrecked was one of this class.  They are supposed to have been upheaved\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea by volcanic agency; but they are not\r\nthemselves volcanic in their nature, neither are they of coral\r\nformation.  Those of the third class are the low coralline islands,\r\nusually having lagoons of water in their midst.  They are very numerous.\r\n\r\n\"As to the manner in which coral islands and reefs are formed, there are\r\nvarious opinions on this point.  I will give you what seems to me the\r\nmost probable theory--a theory, I may add, which is held by some of the\r\ngood and scientific missionaries.  It is well known that there is much\r\nlime in salt water; it is also known that coral is composed of lime.  It\r\nis supposed that the polypes, or coral insects, have the power of\r\nattracting this lime to their bodies, and with this material they build\r\ntheir little cells or habitations.  They choose the summit of a volcano,\r\nor the top of a submarine mountain, as a foundation on which to build,\r\nfor it is found that they never work at any great depth below the\r\nsurface.  On this they work.  The polypes on the mountain-top, of\r\ncourse, reach the surface first; then those at the outer edges reach the\r\ntop sooner than the others between them and the centre, thus forming the\r\ncoral reef surrounding the lagoon of water and the central island.\r\nAfter that, the insects within the lagoon cease working.  When the\r\nsurface of the water is reached, these myriads of wonderful creatures\r\ndie.  Then birds visit the spot, and seeds are thus conveyed thither,\r\nwhich take root and spring up and flourish.  Thus are commenced those\r\ncoralline islets of which you have seen so many in these seas.  The\r\nreefs round the large islands are formed in a similar manner.  When we\r\nconsider,\" added the missionary, \"the smallness of the architects used\r\nby our heavenly Father in order to form those lovely and innumerable\r\nislands, we are filled with much of that feeling which induced the\r\nancient king to exclaim, `How manifold, O Lord, are Thy works! in wisdom\r\nhast Thou made them all.'\"\r\n\r\nWe all heartily agreed with the missionary in this sentiment, and felt\r\nnot a little gratified to find that the opinions which Jack and I had\r\nbeen led to form, from personal observation on our Coral Island, were\r\nthus to a great extent corroborated.\r\n\r\nThe missionary also gave us an account of the manner in which\r\nChristianity had been introduced among them.  He said: \"When\r\nmissionaries were first sent here, three years ago, a small vessel\r\nbrought them; and the chief, who is now dead, promised to treat well the\r\ntwo native teachers who were left with their wives on the island.  But\r\nscarcely had the boat which landed them returned to the ship than the\r\nnatives began to maltreat their guests, taking away all they possessed,\r\nand offering them further violence, so that when the boat was sent in\r\nhaste to fetch them away, the clothes of both men and women were torn\r\nnearly off their backs.\r\n\r\n\"Two years after this the vessel visited them again, and I, being in\r\nher, volunteered to land alone, without any goods whatever, begging that\r\nmy wife might be brought to me the following year--that is, _this_ year;\r\nand, as you see, she is with me.  But the surf was so high that the boat\r\ncould not land me; so with nothing on but my trousers and shirt, and\r\nwith a few catechisms and a Bible, besides some portions of the\r\nScripture translated into the Mango tongue, I sprang into the sea, and\r\nswam ashore on the crest of a breaker.  I was instantly dragged up the\r\nbeach by the natives; who, on finding I had nothing worth having upon\r\nme, let me alone.  I then made signs to my friends in the ship to leave\r\nme, which they did.  At first the natives listened to me in silence, but\r\nlaughed at what I said while I preached the Gospel of our blessed\r\nSaviour Jesus Christ to them.  Afterwards they treated me ill,\r\nsometimes; but I persevered, and continued to dwell among them, and\r\ndispute, and exhort them to give up their sinful ways of life, burn\r\ntheir idols, and come to Jesus.\r\n\r\n\"About a month after I landed, I heard that the chief was dead.  He was\r\nthe father of the present chief, who is now a most consistent member of\r\nthe Church.  It is a custom here that when a chief dies his wives are\r\nstrangled and buried with him.  Knowing this, I hastened to his house to\r\nendeavour to prevent such cruelty if possible.  When I arrived, I found\r\ntwo of the wives had already been killed, while another was in the act\r\nof being strangled.  I pleaded hard for her, but it was too late; she\r\nwas already dead.  I then entreated the son to spare the fourth wife,\r\nand after much hesitation, my prayer was granted; but in half-an-hour\r\nafterwards this poor woman repented of being unfaithful, as she termed\r\nit, to her husband, and insisted on being strangled, which was\r\naccordingly done.\r\n\r\n\"All this time the chief's son was walking up and down before his\r\nfather's house with a brow black as thunder.  When he entered I went in\r\nwith him, and found, to my surprise, that his father was _not_ dead!\r\nThe old man was sitting on a mat in a corner, with an expression of\r\nplacid resignation on his face.\r\n\r\n\"`Why,' said I, `have you strangled your father's wives before he is\r\ndead?'\r\n\r\n\"To this the son replied, `He is dead.  That is no longer my father.  He\r\nis as good as dead now.  He is to be _buried alive_.'\r\n\r\n\"I now remembered having heard that it is a custom among the Feejee\r\nIslanders that when the reigning chief grows old and infirm, the heir to\r\nthe chieftainship has a right to depose his father, in which case he is\r\nconsidered as dead, and is buried alive.  The young chief was now about\r\nto follow this custom, and despite my earnest entreaties and pleadings,\r\nthe old chief was buried that day before my eyes in the same grave with\r\nhis four strangled wives!  Oh, my heart groaned when I saw this! and I\r\nprayed to God to open the hearts of these poor creatures, as He had\r\nalready opened mine, and pour into them the light and the love of the\r\nGospel of Jesus.  My prayer was answered very soon.  A week afterwards\r\nthe son, who was now chief of the tribe, came to me, bearing his god on\r\nhis shoulders, and groaning beneath its weight.  Flinging it down at my\r\nfeet, he desired me to burn it!\r\n\r\n\"You may conceive how overjoyed I was at this.  I sprang up and embraced\r\nhim, while I shed tears of joy.  Then we made a fire and burned the god\r\nto ashes, amid an immense concourse of the people, who seemed terrified\r\nat what was being done, and shrank back when we burned the god,\r\nexpecting some signal vengeance to be taken upon us; but seeing that\r\nnothing happened, they changed their minds, and thought that our God\r\nmust be the true one after all.  From that time the mission prospered\r\nsteadily; and now, while there is not a single man in the tribe who has\r\nnot burned his household gods and become a convert to Christianity,\r\nthere are not a few, I hope, who are true followers of the Lamb, having\r\nbeen plucked as brands from the burning by Him who can save unto the\r\nuttermost.  I will not tell you more of our progress at this time; but\r\nyou see,\" he said, waving his hand around him, \"the village, and the\r\nchurch did not exist a year ago!\"\r\n\r\nWe were indeed much interested in this account, and I could not help\r\nagain in my heart praying to God to prosper those missionary societies\r\nthat send such inestimable blessings to these islands of dark and bloody\r\nidolatry.  The teacher also added that the other tribes were very\r\nindignant at this one for having burned its gods, and threatened to\r\ndestroy it altogether; but they had done nothing yet.  \"And if they\r\nshould,\" said the teacher, \"the Lord is on our side; of whom shall we be\r\nafraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the missionaries many stations in these seas?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes.  The London Missionary Society have a great many in the Tahiti\r\ngroup, and other islands in that quarter.  Then the Wesleyans have the\r\nFeejee Islands all to themselves, and the Americans have many stations\r\nin other groups.  But still, my friend, there are hundreds of islands\r\nhere, the natives of which have never heard of Jesus, or the good word\r\nof God, or the Holy Spirit; and thousands are living and dying in the\r\npractice of those terrible sins and bloody murders of which you have\r\nalready heard.--I trust, my friends,\" he added, looking earnestly into\r\nour faces--\"I trust that if you ever return to England, you will tell\r\nyour Christian friends that the horrors which they hear of in regard to\r\nthese islands are _literally true_, and that when they have heard the\r\nworst, the `_half has not been told them_;' for there are perpetrated\r\nhere foul deeds of darkness of which man may not speak.  You may also\r\ntell them,\" he said, looking around with a smile, while a tear of\r\ngratitude trembled in his eye and rolled down his coal-black\r\ncheek--\"tell them of the blessings that the Gospel has wrought _here_!\"\r\n\r\nWe assured our friend that we would certainly not forget his request.\r\nOn returning towards the village, about noon, we remarked on the\r\nbeautiful whiteness of the cottages.\r\n\r\n\"That is owing to the lime with which they are plastered,\" said the\r\nteacher.  \"When the natives were converted, as I have described, I set\r\nthem to work to build cottages for themselves, and also this handsome\r\nchurch which you see.  When the framework and other parts of the house\r\nwere up, I sent the people to fetch coral from the sea.  They brought\r\nimmense quantities.  Then I made them cut wood, and piling the coral\r\nabove it, set it on fire.\r\n\r\n\"`Look! look!' cried the poor people in amazement; `what wonderful\r\npeople the Christians are!  He is roasting stones!  We shall not need\r\ntaro or bread-fruit any more; we may eat stones!'\r\n\r\n\"But their surprise was still greater when the coral was reduced to a\r\nfine, soft, white powder.  They immediately set up a great shout, and\r\nmingling the lime with water, rubbed their faces and their bodies all\r\nover with it, and ran through the village screaming with delight.  They\r\nwere also much surprised at another thing they saw me do.  I wished to\r\nmake some household furniture, and constructed a turning-lathe to assist\r\nme.  The first thing that I turned was the leg of a sofa, which was no\r\nsooner finished than the chief seized it with wonder and delight, and\r\nran through the village exhibiting it to the people, who looked upon it\r\nwith great admiration.  The chief then, tying a string to it, hung it\r\nround his neck as an ornament!  He afterwards told me that if he had\r\nseen it before he became a Christian, he would have made it his god!\"\r\n\r\nAs the teacher concluded this anecdote we reached his door.  Saying that\r\nhe had business to attend to, he left us to amuse ourselves as we best\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack, turning abruptly towards us, and buttoning up\r\nhis jacket as he spoke, \"I'm off to see the battle.  I've no particular\r\nfondness for seein' bloodshed; but I must find out the nature o' these\r\nfellows and see their customs with my own eyes, so that I may be able to\r\nspeak of it again, if need be, authoritatively.  It's only six miles\r\noff, and we don't run much more risk than that of getting a rap with a\r\nstray stone or an overshot arrow.  Will you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure we will,\" said Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"If they chance to see us, we'll cut and run for it,\" added Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" cried Peterkin; \"_you_ run!  I thought you would scorn to run\r\nfrom any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I would, if it were my duty to fight,\" returned Jack coolly; \"but as\r\nI don't want to fight, and don't intend to fight, if they offer to\r\nattack us I'll run away, like the veriest coward that ever went by the\r\nname of Peterkin.  So come along.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nA STRANGE AND BLOODY BATTLE--THE LION BEARDED IN HIS DEN--FRIGHTFUL\r\nSCENES OF CRUELTY, AND FEARS FOR THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\nWe had ascertained from the teacher the direction to the spot on which\r\nthe battle was to be fought, and after a walk of two hours, reached it.\r\nThe summit of a bare hill was the place chosen; for, unlike most of the\r\nother islanders, who are addicted to bush-fighting, those of Mango are\r\nin the habit of meeting on open ground.  We arrived before the two\r\nparties had commenced the deadly struggle, and creeping as close up as\r\nwe dared among the rocks, we lay and watched them.\r\n\r\nThe combatants were drawn up face to face, each side ranged in rank four\r\ndeep.  Those in the first row were armed with long spears; the second\r\nwith clubs to defend the spearmen; the third row was composed of young\r\nmen with slings; and the fourth consisted of women, who carried baskets\r\nof stones for the slingers, and clubs and spears with which to supply\r\nthe warriors.  Soon after we arrived, the attack was made with great\r\nfury.  There was no science displayed.  The two bodies of savages rushed\r\nheadlong upon each other and engaged in a general melee, and a more\r\ndreadful set of men I have never seen.  They wore grotesque war-caps,\r\nmade of various substances and decorated with feathers.  Their faces and\r\nbodies were painted so as to make them look as frightful as possible;\r\nand as they brandished their massive clubs, leaped, shouted, yelled, and\r\ndashed each other to the ground, I thought I had never seen men look so\r\nlike demons before.\r\n\r\nWe were much surprised at the conduct of the women, who seemed to be\r\nperfect furies, and hung about the heels of their husbands in order to\r\ndefend them.  One stout young woman we saw, whose husband was hard\r\npressed and about to be overcome: she lifted a large stone, and throwing\r\nit at his opponent's head, felled him to the earth.  But the battle did\r\nnot last long.  The band most distant from us gave way and were routed,\r\nleaving eighteen of their comrades dead upon the field.  These the\r\nvictors brained as they lay; and putting some of their brains on leaves,\r\nwent off with them, we were afterwards informed, to their temples to\r\npresent them to their gods as an earnest of the human victims who were\r\nsoon to be brought there.\r\n\r\nWe hastened back to the Christian village with feelings of the deepest\r\nsadness at the sanguinary conflict which we had just witnessed.\r\n\r\nNext day, after breakfasting with our friend the teacher, we made\r\npreparations for carrying out our plan.  At first the teacher\r\nendeavoured to dissuade us.\r\n\r\n\"You do not know,\" said he, turning to Jack, \"the danger you run in\r\nventuring amongst these ferocious savages.  I feel much pity for poor\r\nAvatea; but you are not likely to succeed in saving her, and you may die\r\nin the attempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jack quietly, \"I am not afraid to die in a good cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher smiled approvingly at him as he said this, and after a\r\nlittle further conversation, agreed to accompany us as interpreter--\r\nsaying that although Tararo was unfriendly to him, he had hitherto\r\ntreated him with respect.\r\n\r\nWe now went on board the schooner, having resolved to sail round the\r\nisland and drop anchor opposite the heathen village.  We manned her with\r\nnatives, and hoped to overawe the savages by displaying our brass gun to\r\nadvantage.  The teacher soon after came on board, and setting our sails,\r\nwe put to sea.  In two hours more we made the cliffs reverberate with\r\nthe crash of the big gun, which we fired by way of salute, while we ran\r\nthe British ensign up to the peak and cast anchor.  The commotion on\r\nshore showed us that we had struck terror into the hearts of the\r\nnatives; but seeing that we did not offer to molest them, a canoe at\r\nlength put off and paddled cautiously towards us.  The teacher showed\r\nhimself, and explaining that we were friends and wished to palaver with\r\nthe chief, desired the native to go and tell him to come on board.\r\n\r\nWe waited long and with much impatience for an answer.  During this time\r\nthe native teacher conversed with us again, and told us many things\r\nconcerning the success of the Gospel among those islands; and perceiving\r\nthat we were by no means so much gratified as we ought to have been at\r\nthe hearing of such good news, he pressed us more closely in regard to\r\nour personal interest in religion, and exhorted us to consider that our\r\nsouls were certainly in as great danger as those of the wretched heathen\r\nwhom we pitied so much if we had not already found salvation in Jesus\r\nChrist.  \"Nay, further,\" he added, \"if such be your unhappy case, you\r\nare, in the sight of God, much worse than these savages--forgive me, my\r\nyoung friends, for saying so--for they have no knowledge, no light, and\r\ndo not profess to believe; while you, on the contrary, have been brought\r\nup in the light of the blessed Gospel and call yourselves Christians.\r\nThese poor savages are indeed the enemies of our Lord; but you, if ye be\r\nnot true believers, are traitors!\"\r\n\r\nI must confess that my heart condemned me while the teacher spoke in\r\nthis earnest manner, and I knew not what to reply.  Peterkin, too, did\r\nnot seem to like it, and, I thought, would willingly have escaped.  But\r\nJack seemed deeply impressed, and wore an anxious expression on his\r\nnaturally grave countenance, while he assented to the teacher's remarks,\r\nand put to him many earnest questions.  Meanwhile the natives who\r\ncomposed our crew, having nothing particular to do, had squatted down on\r\nthe deck and taken out their little books containing the translated\r\nportions of the New Testament, along with hymns and spelling-books, and\r\nwere now busily engaged--some vociferating the alphabet, others learning\r\nprayers off by heart, while a few sang hymns--all of them being utterly\r\nunmindful of our presence.  The teacher soon joined them, and soon\r\nafterwards they all engaged in a prayer, which was afterwards translated\r\nto us, and proved to be a petition for the success of our undertaking\r\nand for the conversion of the heathen.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus engaged a canoe put off from shore, and several\r\nsavages leaped on deck, one of whom advanced to the teacher and informed\r\nhim that Tararo could not come on board that day, being busy with some\r\nreligious ceremonies before the gods, which could on no account be\r\npostponed.  He was also engaged with a friendly chief, who was about to\r\ntake his departure from the island, and therefore begged that the\r\nteacher and his friends would land and pay a visit to him.  To this the\r\nteacher returned answer that we would land immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" said Jack as we were about to step into our little boat,\r\n\"I'm not going to take any weapons with me, and I recommend you to take\r\nnone either.  We are altogether in the power of these savages; and the\r\nutmost we could do, if they were to attack us, would be to kill a few of\r\nthem before we were ourselves overpowered.  I think that our only chance\r\nof success lies in mild measures.  Don't you think so?\"\r\n\r\nTo this I assented gladly; and Peterkin replied by laying down a huge\r\nbell-mouthed blunderbuss, and divesting himself of a pair of enormous\r\nhorse-pistols, with which he had purposed to overawe the natives!  We\r\nthen jumped into our boat and rowed ashore.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the beach we were received by a crowd of naked savages, who\r\nshouted a rude welcome, and conducted us to a house or shed where a\r\nbaked pig and a variety of vegetables were prepared for us.  Having\r\npartaken of these, the teacher begged to be conducted to the chief; but\r\nthere seemed some hesitation, and after some consultation among\r\nthemselves, one of the men stood forward and spoke to the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"What says he?\" inquired Jack when the savage had concluded.\r\n\r\n\"He says that the chief is just going to the temple of his god, and\r\ncannot see us yet; so we must be patient, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" cried Jack, rising, \"if he won't come to see me, I'll e'en go\r\nand see him.  Besides, I have a great desire to witness their\r\nproceedings at this temple of theirs.  Will you go with me, friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" said the teacher, shaking his head.  \"I must not go to the\r\nheathen temples and witness their inhuman rites, except for the purpose\r\nof condemning their wickedness and folly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" returned Jack; \"then I'll go alone, for I cannot condemn\r\ntheir doings till I have seen them.\"\r\n\r\nJack arose, and we, having determined to go also, followed him through\r\nthe banana-groves to a rising ground immediately behind the village, on\r\nthe top of which stood the Bure, or temple, under the dark shade of a\r\ngroup of iron-wood trees.  As we went through the village I was again\r\nled to contrast the rude huts and sheds, and their almost naked,\r\nsavage-looking inhabitants, with the natives of the Christian village,\r\nwho, to use the teacher's scriptural expression, were now \"clothed and\r\nin their right mind.\"\r\n\r\nAs we turned into a broad path leading towards the hill, we were\r\narrested by the shouts of an approaching multitude in the rear.  Drawing\r\naside into the bushes, we awaited their coming up; and as they drew\r\nnear, we observed that it was a procession of the natives, many of whom\r\nwere dancing and gesticulating in the most frantic manner.  They had an\r\nexceedingly hideous aspect, owing to the black, red, and yellow paints\r\nwith which their faces and naked bodies were bedaubed.  In the midst of\r\nthese came a band of men carrying three or four planks, on which were\r\nseated, in rows, upwards of a dozen men.  I shuddered involuntarily as I\r\nrecollected the sacrifice of human victims at the island of Emo, and\r\nturned with a look of fear to Jack as I said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh Jack!  I have a terrible dread that they are going to commit some of\r\ntheir cruel practices on these wretched men.  We had better not go to\r\nthe temple.  We shall only be horrified without being able to do any\r\ngood, for I fear they are going to kill them.\"\r\n\r\nJack's face wore an expression of deep compassion as he said in a low\r\nvoice, \"No fear, Ralph; the sufferings of these poor fellows are over\r\nlong ago.\"\r\n\r\nI turned with a start as he spoke, and glancing at the men, who were now\r\nquite near to the spot where we stood, saw that they were all dead.\r\nThey were tied firmly with ropes in a sitting posture on the planks, and\r\nseemed, as they bent their sightless eyeballs and grinning mouths over\r\nthe dancing crew below, as if they were laughing in ghastly mockery at\r\nthe utter inability of their enemies to hurt them now.  These, we\r\ndiscovered afterwards, were the men who had been slain in the battle of\r\nthe previous day, and were now on their way to be first presented to the\r\ngods and then eaten.  Behind these came two men leading between them a\r\nthird, whose hands were pinioned behind his back.  He walked with a firm\r\nstep, and wore a look of utter indifference on his face as they led him\r\nalong, so that we concluded he must be a criminal who was about to\r\nreceive some slight punishment for his faults.  The rear of the\r\nprocession was brought up by a shouting crowd of women and children,\r\nwith whom we mingled and followed to the temple.\r\n\r\nHere we arrived in a few minutes.  The temple was a tall, circular\r\nbuilding, open at one side.  Around it were strewn heaps of human bones\r\nand skulls.  At a table inside sat the priest, an elderly man with a\r\nlong grey beard.  He was seated on a stool, and before him lay several\r\nknives, made of wood, bone, and splinters of bamboo, with which he\r\nperformed his office of dissecting dead bodies.  Farther in lay a\r\nvariety of articles that had been dedicated to the god, and among them\r\nwere many spears and clubs.  I observed among the latter some with human\r\nteeth sticking in them, where the victims had been clubbed in their\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\nBefore this temple the bodies, which were painted with vermilion and\r\nsoot, were arranged in a sitting posture; and a man called a \"dan-vosa\"\r\n(orator) advanced, and laying his hands on their heads, began to chide\r\nthem, apparently, in a low, bantering tone.  What he said we knew not,\r\nbut as he went on he waxed warm, and at last shouted to them at the top\r\nof his lungs, and finally finished by kicking the bodies over and\r\nrunning away, amid the shouts and laughter of the people, who now rushed\r\nforward.  Seizing the bodies by a leg or an arm, or by the hair of the\r\nhead, they dragged them over stumps and stones and through sloughs until\r\nthey were exhausted.  The bodies were then brought back to the temple\r\nand dissected by the priest, after which they were taken out to be\r\nbaked.\r\n\r\nClose to the temple a large fire was kindled, in which stones were\r\nheated red hot.  When ready these were spread out on the ground, and a\r\nthick coating of leaves strewn over them to slack the heat.  On this\r\n\"lovo,\" or oven, the bodies were then placed, covered over, and left to\r\nbake.\r\n\r\nThe crowd now ran with terrible yells towards a neighbouring hill or\r\nmound, on which we observed the framework of a house lying ready to be\r\nerected.  Sick with horror, yet fascinated by curiosity, we staggered\r\nafter them mechanically, scarce knowing where we were going or what we\r\ndid, and feeling a sort of impression that all we saw was a dreadful\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nArrived at the place, we saw the multitude crowding round a certain\r\nspot.  We pressed forward, and obtained a sight of what they were doing.\r\nA large wooden beam or post lay on the ground, beside the other parts\r\nof the framework of the house, and close to the end of it was a hole\r\nabout seven feet deep and upwards of two feet wide.  While we looked,\r\nthe man whom we had before observed with his hands pinioned was carried\r\ninto the circle.  His hands were now free, but his legs were tightly\r\nstrapped together.  The post of the house was then placed in the hole,\r\nand the man put in beside it.  His head was a good way below the surface\r\nof the hole, and his arms were clasped round the post.  Earth was now\r\nthrown in until all was covered over and stamped down; and this, we were\r\nafterwards told, was a ceremony usually performed at the dedication of a\r\nnew temple or the erection of a chief's house!\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" cried Jack on beholding this horrible tragedy; \"we have\r\nseen enough, enough--far more than enough!  Let us go.\"\r\n\r\nJack's face looked ghastly pale and haggard as we hurried back to rejoin\r\nthe teacher; and I have no doubt that he felt terrible anxiety when he\r\nconsidered the number and ferocity of the savages, and the weakness of\r\nthe few arms which were ready indeed to essay, but impotent to effect,\r\nAvatea's deliverance from these ruthless men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nAN UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY, AND A BOLD, RECKLESS DEFIANCE, WITH ITS\r\nCONSEQUENCES--PLANS OF ESCAPE, AND HEROIC RESOLVES.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to the shore and related to our friend what had passed,\r\nhe was greatly distressed, and groaned in spirit; but we had not sat\r\nlong in conversation when we were interrupted by the arrival of Tararo\r\non the beach, accompanied by a number of followers bearing baskets of\r\nvegetables and fruits on their heads.\r\n\r\nWe advanced to meet him, and he expressed, through our interpreter, much\r\npleasure in seeing us.\r\n\r\n\"And what, is it that my friends wish to say to me?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\nThe teacher explained that we came to beg that Avatea might be spared.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him,\" said Jack, \"that I consider that I have a right to ask this\r\nof him, having not only saved the girl's life, but the lives of his own\r\npeople also; and say that I wish her to be allowed to follow her own\r\nwishes, and join the Christians.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this was being translated the chief's brow lowered, and we could\r\nsee plainly that our request met with no favourable reception.  He\r\nreplied with considerable energy and at some length.\r\n\r\n\"What says he?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I regret to say that he will not listen to the proposal.  He says he\r\nhas pledged his word to his friend that the girl shall be sent to him,\r\nand a deputy even now on this island awaiting the fulfilment of the\r\npledge.\"\r\n\r\nJack bit his lip in suppressed anger.  \"Tell Tararo,\" he exclaimed with\r\na flashing eye, \"that if he does not grant my demand it will be worse\r\nfor him.  Say I have a big gun on board my schooner that will blow his\r\nvillage into the sea if he does not give up the girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my friend,\" said the teacher gently, \"I will not tell him that.\r\nWe must `overcome evil with good.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What does my friend say?\" inquired the chief, who seemed nettled by\r\nJack's looks of defiance.\r\n\r\n\"He is displeased,\" replied the teacher.\r\n\r\nTararo turned away with a smile of contempt, and walked towards the men\r\nwho carried the baskets of vegetables, and who had now emptied the whole\r\non the beach in an enormous pile.\r\n\r\n\"What are they doing there?\"  I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I think that they are laying out a gift which they intend to present to\r\nsome one,\" said the teacher.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a couple of men appeared, leading a young girl between\r\nthem, and going towards the heap of fruits and vegetables, placed her on\r\ntop of it.  We started with surprise and fear, for in the young female\r\nbefore us we recognised the Samoan girl, Avatea.\r\n\r\nWe stood rooted to the earth with surprise and thick-coming fears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my dear young friend!\" whispered the teacher in a voice of deep\r\nemotion; while he seized Jack by the arm, \"she is to be made a sacrifice\r\neven now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she?\" cried Jack with a vehement shout, spurning the teacher aside,\r\nand dashing over two natives who stood in his way, while he rushed\r\ntowards the heap, sprang up its side, and seized Avatea by the arm.  In\r\nanother moment he dragged her down, placed her back to a large tree, and\r\nwrenching a war-club from the hand of a native who seemed powerless and\r\npetrified with surprise, whirled it above his head, and yelled, rather\r\nthan shouted, while his face blazed with fury, \"Come on, the whole\r\nnation of you, an ye like it, and do your worst!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though the challenge had been literally accepted; for every\r\nsavage on the ground ran precipitately at Jack with club and spear, and\r\ndoubtless would speedily have poured out his brave blood on the sod had\r\nnot the teacher rushed in between them, and raising his voice to its\r\nutmost, cried:\r\n\r\n\"Stay your hands, warriors!  It is not your part to judge in this\r\nmatter!  It is for Tararo, the chief, to say whether or not the young\r\nman shall live or die!\"\r\n\r\nThe natives were arrested; and I know not whether it was the gratifying\r\nacknowledgment of his superiority thus made by the teacher, or some\r\nlingering feeling of gratitude for Jack's former aid in time of need,\r\nthat influenced Tararo, but he stepped forward, and waving his hand,\r\nsaid to his people, \"Desist.  The young man's life is mine.\"  Then\r\nturning to Jack, he said, \"You have forfeited your liberty and life to\r\nme.  Submit yourself, for we are more numerous than the sand upon the\r\nshore.  You are but one: why should you die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Villain!\" exclaimed Jack passionately.  \"I may die, but assuredly I\r\nshall not perish alone!  I will not submit until you promise that this\r\ngirl shall not be injured!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very bold,\" replied the chief haughtily, \"but very foolish.\r\nYet I will say that Avatea shall not be sent away--at least, for three\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better accept these terms,\" whispered the teacher entreatingly.\r\n\"If you persist in this mad defiance, you will be slain and Avatea will\r\nbe lost.  Three days are worth having.\"\r\n\r\nJack hesitated a moment, then lowered his club, and throwing it moodily\r\nto the ground, crossed his arms on his breast and hung down his head in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nTararo seemed pleased by his submission, and told the teacher to say\r\nthat he did not forget his former services, and therefore would leave\r\nhim free as to his person, but that the schooner would be detained till\r\nhe had further considered the matter.\r\n\r\nWhile the teacher translated this, he approached as near to where Avatea\r\nwas standing as possible without creating suspicion, and whispered to\r\nher a few words in the native language.  Avatea, who, during the whole\r\nof the foregoing scene, had stood leaning against the tree perfectly\r\npassive, and seemingly quite uninterested in all that was going on,\r\nreplied by a single rapid glance of her dark eye, which was instantly\r\ncast down again on the ground at her feet.\r\n\r\nTararo now advanced, and taking the girl by the hand, led her\r\nunresistingly away; while Jack, Peterkin, and I returned with the\r\nteacher on board the schooner.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the deck we went down to the cabin, where Jack threw\r\nhimself, in a state of great dejection, on a couch; but the teacher\r\nseated himself by his side, and laying his hand upon his shoulder, said:\r\n\r\n\"Do not give way to anger, my young friend.  God has given us three\r\ndays, and we must use the means that are in our power to free this poor\r\ngirl from slavery.  We must not sit in idle disappointment; we must\r\nact--\"\r\n\r\n\"Act!\" cried Jack, raising himself and tossing back his hair wildly.\r\n\"It is mockery to talk of acting when one is bound hand and foot.  How\r\ncan I act?  I cannot fight a whole nation of savages single-handed.\r\nYes,\" he said with a bitter smile, \"I _can_ fight them; but I cannot\r\nconquer them, or save Avatea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, my friend: your spirit is not a good one just now.  You\r\ncannot expect that blessing which alone can ensure success unless you\r\nare more submissive.  I will tell you my plans if you will listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" cried Jack eagerly.  \"Of course I will, my good fellow!  I did\r\nnot know you had any plans.  Out with them!  I only hope you will show\r\nme how I can get the girl on board of this schooner, and I'd up anchor\r\nand away in no time.  But proceed with your plans.\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher smiled sadly.  \"Ah, my friend, if one fathom of your\r\nanchor-chain were to rattle as you drew it in, a thousand warriors would\r\nbe standing on your deck!  No, no; that could not be done.  Even now\r\nyour ship would be taken from you were it not that Tararo has some\r\nfeeling of gratitude towards you.  But I know Tararo well.  He is a man\r\nof falsehood, as all the unconverted savages are.  The chief to whom he\r\nhas promised this girl is very powerful, and Tararo _must_ fulfil his\r\npromise.  He has told you that he would do nothing to the girl for three\r\ndays, but that is because the party who are to take her away will not be\r\nready to start for three days.  Still, as he might have made you a\r\nprisoner during those three days, I say that God has given them to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but what do you propose to do?\" said Jack impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"My plan involves much danger; but I see no other, and I think you have\r\ncourage to brave it.  It is this.  There is an island about fifty miles\r\nto the south of this, the natives of which are Christians, and have been\r\nso for two years or more, and the principal chief is Avatea's lover.\r\nOnce there, Avatea would be safe.  Now, I suggest that you should\r\nabandon your schooner.  Do you think that you can make so great a\r\nsacrifice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Friend,\" replied Jack, \"when I make up my mind to go through with a\r\nthing of importance, I can make any sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher smiled.  \"Well, then, the savages could not conceive it\r\npossible that for the sake of a girl you would voluntarily lose your\r\nfine vessel; therefore, as long as she lies here, they think they have\r\nyou all safe.  So I suggest that we get a quantity of stores conveyed to\r\na sequestered part of the shore, provide a small canoe, put Avatea on\r\nboard, and you three would paddle to the Christian island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" cried Peterkin, springing up and seizing the teacher's hand.\r\n\"Missionary, you're a regular brick!  I didn't think you had so much in\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"As for me,\" continued the teacher, \"I will remain on board till they\r\ndiscover that you are gone.  Then they will ask me where you are gone\r\nto, and I will refuse to tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what'll be the result of that?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I know not.  Perhaps they will kill me; but,\" he added, looking at Jack\r\nwith a peculiar smile, \"I too am not afraid to die in a good cause!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are we to get hold of Avatea?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I have arranged with her to meet us at a particular spot, to which I\r\nwill guide you to-night.  We shall then arrange about it.  She will\r\neasily manage to elude her keepers, who are not very strict in watching\r\nher, thinking it impossible that she could escape from the island.\r\nIndeed, I am sure that such an idea will never enter their heads.  But,\r\nas I have said, you run great danger.  Fifty miles in a small canoe, on\r\nthe open sea, is a great voyage to make.  You may miss the island, too,\r\nin which case there is no other in that direction for a hundred miles or\r\nmore; and if you lose your way and fall among other heathens, you know\r\nthe law of Feejee--a castaway who gains the shore is doomed to die.  You\r\nmust count the cost, my young friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have counted it,\" replied Jack.  \"If Avatea consents to run the risk,\r\nmost certainly I will; and so will my comrades also.  Besides,\" added\r\nJack, looking seriously into the teacher's face, \"your Bible--our\r\nBible--tells of ONE who delivers those who call on Him in the time of\r\ntrouble; who holds the winds in His fists, and the waters in the hollow\r\nof His hand.\"\r\n\r\nWe now set about active preparations for the intended voyage: collected\r\ntogether such things as we should require, and laid out on the deck\r\nprovisions sufficient to maintain us for several weeks, purposing to\r\nload the canoe with as much as she could hold consistently with speed\r\nand safety.  These we covered with a tarpaulin, intending to convey them\r\nto the canoe only a few hours before starting.  When night spread her\r\nsable curtain over the scene, we prepared to land; but first kneeling\r\nalong with the natives and the teacher, the latter implored a blessing\r\non our enterprise.  Then we rowed quietly to the shore and followed our\r\nsable guide, who led us by a long detour in order to avoid the village,\r\nto the place of rendezvous.  We had not stood more than five minutes\r\nunder the gloomy shade of the thick foliage when a dark figure glided\r\nnoiselessly up to us.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, here you are!\" said Jack as Avatea approached.--\"Now, then, tell\r\nher what we've come about, and don't waste time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understan' leetl' English,\" said Avatea in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Why, where did you pick up English?\" exclaimed Jack in amazement.  \"You\r\nwere dumb as a stone when I saw you last.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has learned all she knows of it from me,\" said the teacher, \"since\r\nshe came to the island.\"\r\n\r\nWe now gave Avatea a full explanation of our plans, entering into all\r\nthe details, and concealing none of the danger, so that she might be\r\nfully aware of the risk she ran.  As we had anticipated, she was too\r\nglad of the opportunity thus afforded her to escape from her persecutors\r\nto think of the danger or risk.\r\n\r\n\"Then you're willing to go with us, are you?\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Yis, I willing to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're not afraid to trust yourself out on the deep sea so far?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I not 'fraid to go.  Safe with Christian.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some further consultation the teacher suggested that it was time\r\nto return, so we bade Avatea good-night; and having appointed to meet at\r\nthe cliff where the canoe lay on the following night, just after dark,\r\nwe hastened away--we to row back to the schooner with muffled oars,\r\nAvatea to glide back to her prison-hut among the Mango savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT--THE PURSUIT--DESPAIR AND ITS RESULTS--THE LION BEARDED IN\r\nHIS DEN AGAIN--AWFUL DANGER THREATENED AND WONDERFULLY AVERTED--A\r\nTERRIFIC STORM.\r\n\r\nAs the time for our meditated flight drew near, we became naturally very\r\nfearful lest our purpose should be discovered, and we spent the whole of\r\nthe following day in a state of nervous anxiety.  We resolved to go\r\nashore and ramble about the village, as if to observe the habits and\r\ndwellings of the people, as we thought that an air of affected\r\nindifference to the events of the previous day would be more likely than\r\nany other course of conduct to avert suspicion as to our intentions.\r\nWhile we were thus occupied, the teacher remained on board with the\r\nChristian natives, whose powerful voices reached us ever and anon as\r\nthey engaged in singing hymns or in prayer.\r\n\r\nAt last the long and tedious day came to a close, the sun sank into the\r\nsea, and the short-lived twilight of those regions, to which I have\r\nalready referred, ended abruptly in a dark night.  Hastily throwing a\r\nfew blankets into our little boat, we stepped into it, and whispering\r\nfarewell to the natives in the schooner, rowed gently over the lagoon,\r\ntaking care to keep as near to the beach as possible.  We rowed in the\r\nutmost silence and with muffled oars, so that had any one observed us at\r\nthe distance of a few yards, he might have almost taken us for a phantom\r\nboat or a shadow on the dark water.  Not a breath of air was stirring;\r\nbut fortunately the gentle ripple of the sea upon the shore, mingled\r\nwith the soft roar of the breaker on the distant reef, effectually\r\ndrowned the slight plash that we unavoidably made in the water by the\r\ndipping of our oars.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour sufficed to bring us to the overhanging cliff under\r\nwhose black shadow our little canoe lay, with her bow in the water,\r\nready to be launched, and most of her cargo already stowed away.  As the\r\nkeel of our little boat grated on the sand, a hand was laid upon the\r\nbow, and a dim form was seen.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Peterkin in a whisper as he stepped upon the beach; \"is that\r\nyou, Avatea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, it am me,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"All right--Now, then, gently--Help me to shove off the canoe,\"\r\nwhispered Jack to the teacher.--\"And, Peterkin, do you shove these\r\nblankets aboard; we may want them before long.--Avatea, step into the\r\nmiddle: that's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is all ready?\" whispered the teacher.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite,\" replied Peterkin.--\"Here, Ralph, lay hold o' this pair of\r\noars, and stow them away if you can.  I don't like paddles.  After we're\r\nsafe away, I'll try to rig up rowlocks for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, in with you and shove off!\"\r\n\r\nOne more earnest squeeze of the kind teacher's hand, and with his\r\nwhispered blessing yet sounding in our ears, we shot like an arrow from\r\nthe shore, sped over the still waters of the lagoon, and paddled as\r\nswiftly as strong arms and willing hearts could urge us over the long\r\nswell of the open sea.\r\n\r\nAll that night and the whole of the following day we plied our paddles\r\nin almost total silence and without a halt, save twice to recruit our\r\nfailing energies with a mouthful of food and a draught of water.  Jack\r\nhad taken the bearing of the island just after starting, and laying a\r\nsmall pocket-compass before him, kept the head of the canoe due south,\r\nfor our chance of hitting the island depended very much on the\r\nfaithfulness of our steersman in keeping our tiny bark exactly and\r\nconstantly on its proper course.  Peterkin and I paddled in the bow, and\r\nAvatea worked untiringly in the middle.\r\n\r\nAs the sun's lower limb dipped on the gilded edge of the sea Jack ceased\r\nworking, threw down his paddle, and called a halt.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" he cried, heaving a deep, long-drawn sigh; \"we've put a\r\nconsiderable breadth of water between us and these black rascals, so now\r\nwe'll have a hearty supper and a sound sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" cried Peterkin.  \"Nobly spoken, Jack!--Hand me a drop of\r\nwater, Ralph.--Why, girl, what's wrong with you?  You look just like a\r\nblack owl blinking in the sunshine!\"\r\n\r\nAvatea smiled.  \"I sleepy,\" she said; and as if to prove the truth of\r\nthis, she laid her head on the edge of the canoe and fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\"That's uncommon sharp practice,\" said Peterkin with a broad grin.\r\n\"Don't you think we should awake her to make her eat something first?\r\nOr perhaps,\" he added with a grave, meditative look--\"perhaps we might\r\nput some food in her mouth, which is so elegantly open at the present\r\nmoment, and see if she'd swallow it while asleep.--If so, Ralph, you\r\nmight come round to the front here and feed her quietly, while Jack and\r\nI are tucking into the victuals.  It would be a monstrous economy of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help smiling at Peterkin's idea, which indeed, when I\r\npondered it, seemed remarkably good in theory; nevertheless, I declined\r\nto put it in practice, being fearful of the result should the victuals\r\nchance to go down the wrong throat.  But on suggesting this to Peterkin,\r\nhe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Down the wrong throat, man!  Why, a fellow with half-an-eye might see\r\nthat if it went down Avatea's throat it could not go down the wrong\r\nthroat!--unless, indeed, you have all of a sudden become inordinately\r\nselfish, and think that all the throats in the world are wrong ones\r\nexcept your own.  However, don't talk so much, and hand me the pork\r\nbefore Jack finishes it.  I feel myself entitled to at least one minute\r\nmorsel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peterkin, you're a villain--a paltry little villain!\" said Jack quietly\r\nas he tossed the hind legs (including the tail) of a cold roast pig to\r\nhis comrade; \"and I must again express my regret that unavoidable\r\ncircumstances have thrust your society upon me, and that necessity has\r\ncompelled me to cultivate your acquaintance.  Were it not that you are\r\nincapable of walking upon the water, I would order you, sir, out of the\r\ncanoe!\"\r\n\r\n\"There! you've awakened Avatea with your long tongue,\" retorted\r\nPeterkin, with a frown, as the girl gave vent to a deep sigh.  \"No,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"it was only a snore.  Perchance she dreameth of her black\r\nApollo.--I say, Ralph, do leave just one little slice of that yam!\r\nBetween you and Jack I run a chance of being put on short allowance, if\r\nnot--yei-a-a-ow!\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin's concluding remark was a yawn of so great energy that Jack\r\nrecommended him to postpone the conclusion of his meal till next\r\nmorning--a piece of advice which he followed so quickly that I was\r\nforcibly reminded of his remark, a few minutes before, in regard to the\r\nsharp practice of Avatea.\r\n\r\nMy readers will have observed, probably, by this time, that I am much\r\ngiven to meditation: they will not, therefore, be surprised to learn\r\nthat I fell into a deep reverie on the subject of sleep, which was\r\ncontinued without intermission into the night, and prolonged without\r\ninterruption into the following morning.  But I cannot feel assured that\r\nI actually slept during that time, although I am tolerably certain that\r\nI was not awake.\r\n\r\nThus we lay, like a shadow, on the still bosom of the ocean, while the\r\nnight closed in, and all around was calm, dark, and silent.\r\n\r\nA thrilling cry of alarm from Peterkin startled us in the morning, just\r\nas the grey dawn began to glimmer in the east.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" cried Jack, starting up.\r\n\r\nPeterkin replied by pointing, with a look of anxious dread, towards the\r\nhorizon; and a glance sufficed to show us that one of the largest-sized\r\nwar-canoes was approaching us!\r\n\r\nWith a groan of mingled despair and anger, Jack seized his paddle,\r\nglanced at the compass, and in a suppressed voice commanded us to \"Give\r\nway!\"  But we did not require to be urged.  Already our four paddles\r\nwere glancing in the water, and the canoe bounded over the glassy sea\r\nlike a dolphin, while a shout from our pursuers told that they had\r\nobserved our motions.\r\n\r\n\"I see something like land ahead,\" said Jack in a hopeful tone.  \"It\r\nseems impossible that we could have made the island yet; still, if it is\r\nso, we may reach it before these fellows can catch us, for our canoe is\r\nlight and our muscles are fresh.\"\r\n\r\nNo one replied; for, to say truth, we felt that in a long chase we had\r\nno chance whatever with a canoe which held nearly a hundred warriors.\r\nNevertheless, we resolved to do our utmost to escape, and paddled with a\r\ndegree of vigour that kept us well in advance of our pursuers.  The\r\nwar-canoe was so far behind us that it seemed but a little speck on the\r\nsea, and the shouts to which the crew occasionally gave vent came\r\nfaintly towards us on the morning breeze.  We therefore hoped that we\r\nshould be able to keep in advance for an hour or two, when we might\r\nperhaps reach the land ahead.  But this hope was suddenly crushed by the\r\nsupposed land, not long after, rising up into the sky, thus proving\r\nitself to be a fog-bank!\r\n\r\nA bitter feeling of disappointment filled each heart, and was expressed\r\non each countenance, as we beheld this termination to our hopes.  But we\r\nhad little time to think of regret.  Our danger was too great and\r\nimminent to permit of a moment's relaxation from our exertions.  No hope\r\nnow animated our bosoms; but a feeling of despair, strange to say, lent\r\nus power to work, and nerved our arms with such energy that it was\r\nseveral hours ere the savages overtook us.  When we saw that there was\r\nindeed no chance of escape, and that paddling any longer would only\r\nserve to exhaust our strength without doing any good, we turned the side\r\nof our canoe towards the approaching enemy and laid down our paddles.\r\n\r\nSilently, and with a look of bitter determination on his face, Jack\r\nlifted one of the light boat-oars that we had brought with us, and\r\nresting it on his shoulder, stood up in an attitude of bold defiance.\r\nPeterkin took the other oar and also stood up, but there was no anger\r\nvisible on his countenance: when not sparkling with fun, it usually wore\r\na mild, sad expression, which was deepened on the present occasion as he\r\nglanced at Avatea, who sat with her face resting in her hands upon her\r\nknees.  Without knowing very well what I intended to do, I also arose\r\nand grasped my paddle with both hands.\r\n\r\nOn came the large canoe like a war-horse of the deep, with the foam\r\ncurling from its sharp bow, and the spear-heads of the savages glancing\r\nin the beams of the rising sun.  Perfect silence was maintained on both\r\nsides; and we could hear the hissing water, and see the frowning eyes of\r\nthe warriors, as they came rushing on.  When about twenty yards distant,\r\nfive or six of the savages in the bow rose, and laying aside their\r\npaddles, took up their spears.  Jack and Peterkin raised their oars,\r\nwhile, with a feeling of madness whirling in my brain, I grasped my\r\npaddle and prepared for the onset.  But before any of us could strike a\r\nblow, the sharp prow of the war-canoe struck us like a thunderbolt on\r\nthe side and hurled us into the sea!\r\n\r\nWhat occurred after this I cannot tell, for I was nearly drowned; but\r\nwhen I recovered from the state of insensibility into which I had been\r\nthrown, I found myself stretched on my back, bound hand and foot,\r\nbetween Jack and Peterkin, in the bottom of the large canoe.\r\n\r\nIn this condition we lay the whole day, during which time the savages\r\nonly rested one hour.  When night came they rested again for another\r\nhour, and appeared to sleep just as they sat.  But we were neither\r\nunbound nor allowed to speak to each other during the voyage, nor was a\r\nmorsel of food or a draught of water given to us.  For food, however, we\r\ncared little; but we would have given much for a drop of water to cool\r\nour parched lips.  And we would have been glad, too, had they loosened\r\nthe cords that bound us; for they were tightly fastened, and occasioned\r\nus much pain.  The air, also, was unusually hot--so much so that I felt\r\nconvinced that a storm was brewing.  This also added to our sufferings.\r\nHowever, these were at length relieved by our arrival at the island from\r\nwhich we had fled.\r\n\r\nWhile we were being led ashore, we caught a glimpse of Avatea, who was\r\nseated in the hinder part of the canoe.  She was not fettered in any\r\nway.  Our captors now drove us before them towards the hut of Tararo, at\r\nwhich we speedily arrived, and found the chief seated with an expression\r\non his face that boded us no good.  Our friend the teacher stood beside\r\nhim, with a look of anxiety on his mild features.\r\n\r\n\"How comes it,\" said Tararo, turning to the teacher, \"that these youths\r\nhave abused our hospitality?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him,\" replied Jack, \"that we have not abused his hospitality, for\r\nhis hospitality has not been extended to us.  I came to the island to\r\ndeliver Avatea, and my only regret is that I have failed to do so.  If I\r\nget another chance, I will try to save her yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher shook his head.  \"Nay, my young friend, I had better not\r\ntell him that: it will only incense him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I care not,\" replied Jack.  \"If you don't tell him that, you'll tell\r\nhim nothing, for I won't say anything softer.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing Jack's speech, Tararo frowned, and his eye flashed with\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n\"Go, presumptuous boy!\" he said.  \"My debt to you cancelled.  You and\r\nyour companions shall die!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he rose and signed to several of attendants, who seized Jack\r\nand Peterkin and violently by the collars, and dragging us from the\r\nhouse of the chief, led us through the wood to the outskirts of the\r\nvillage.  Here they thrust us into a species of natural cave in a cliff,\r\nand having barricaded the entrance, left us in total darkness.\r\n\r\nAfter feeling about for some time--for our legs were unshackled,\r\nalthough our wrists were still bound with thongs--we found a low ledge\r\nof rock running along one side of the cavern.  On this we seated\r\nourselves, and for a long time maintained unbroken silence.\r\n\r\nAt last I could restrain my feelings no longer.  \"Alas! dear Jack and\r\nPeterkin,\" said I, \"what is to become of us?  I fear that we are doomed\r\nto die.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not,\" replied Jack in a tremulous voice--\"I know not.  Ralph, I\r\nregret deeply the hastiness of my violent temper, which, I must confess,\r\nhas been the chief cause of our being brought to this sad condition.\r\nPerhaps the teacher may do something for us.  But I have little hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah no!\" said Peterkin with a heavy sigh; \"I am sure he can't help us.\r\nTararo doesn't care more for him than for one of his dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" said I, \"there seems no chance of deliverance, unless the\r\nAlmighty puts forth His arm to save us.  Yet I must say I have great\r\nhope, my comrades; for we have come to this dark place by no fault of\r\nours--unless it be a fault to try to succour a woman in distress.\"\r\n\r\nI was interrupted in my remarks by a noise at the entrance to the\r\ncavern, which was caused by the removal of the barricade.  Immediately\r\nafter three men entered, and taking us by the collars of our coats, led\r\nus away through the forest.  As we advanced we heard much shouting and\r\nbeating of native drums in the village, and at first we thought that our\r\nguards were conducting us to the hut of Tararo again.  But in this we\r\nwere mistaken.  The beating of drums gradually increased, and soon after\r\nwe observed a procession of the natives coming towards us.  At the head\r\nof this procession we were placed, and then we all advanced together\r\ntowards the temple where human victims were wont to be sacrificed!\r\n\r\nA thrill of horror ran through my heart as I recalled to mind the awful\r\nscenes that I had before witnessed at that dreadful spot.  But\r\ndeliverance came suddenly from a quarter whence we little expected it.\r\nDuring the whole of that day there had been an unusual degree of heat in\r\nthe atmosphere, and the sky assumed that lurid aspect which portends a\r\nthunderstorm.  Just as we were approaching the horrid temple, a growl of\r\nthunder burst overhead, and heavy drops of rain began to fall.\r\n\r\nThose who have not witnessed gales and storms in tropical regions can\r\nform but a faint conception of the fearful hurricane that burst upon the\r\nisland of Mango at this time.  Before we reached the temple the storm\r\nburst upon us with a deafening roar; and the natives, who knew too well\r\nthe devastation that was to follow, fled right and left through the\r\nwoods in order to save their property, leaving us alone in the midst of\r\nthe howling storm.  The trees around us bent before the blast like\r\nwillows, and we were about to flee in order to seek shelter when the\r\nteacher ran toward us with a knife in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Thank the Lord,\" he said, cutting our bonds, \"I am in time!  Now, seek\r\nthe shelter of the nearest rock.\"\r\n\r\nThis we did without a moment's hesitation, for the whistling wind burst,\r\never and anon, like thunderclaps among the trees, and tearing them from\r\ntheir roots, hurled them with violence to the ground.  Rain cut across\r\nthe land in sheets, and lightning played like forked serpents in the\r\nair, while high above the roar of the hissing tempest the thunder\r\ncrashed and burst and rolled in awful majesty.\r\n\r\nIn the village the scene was absolutely appalling.  Roofs were blown\r\ncompletely off the houses in many cases, and in others the houses\r\nthemselves were levelled with the ground.  In the midst of this the\r\nnatives were darting to and fro--in some instances saving their goods,\r\nbut in many others seeking to save themselves from the storm of\r\ndestruction that whirled around them.  But terrific although the tempest\r\nwas on land, it was still more tremendous on the mighty ocean.  Billows\r\nsprang, as it were, from the great deep, and while their crests were\r\nabsolutely scattered into white mist, they fell upon the beach with a\r\ncrash that seemed to shake the solid land.  But they did not end there.\r\nEach successive wave swept higher and higher on the beach until the\r\nocean lashed its angry waters among the trees and bushes, and at length,\r\nin a sheet of white, curdled foam, swept into the village and upset and\r\ncarried off, or dashed into wreck, whole rows of the native dwellings!\r\nIt was a sublime, an awful scene, calculated, in some degree at least,\r\nto impress the mind of beholders with the might and majesty of God.\r\n\r\nWe found shelter in a cave that night and all the next day, during which\r\ntime the storm raged in fury.  But on the night following, it abated\r\nsomewhat; and in the morning we went to the village to seek for food,\r\nbeing so famished with hunger that we lost all feeling of danger and all\r\nwish to escape in our desire to satisfy the cravings of nature.  But no\r\nsooner had we obtained food than we began to wish that we had rather\r\nendeavoured to make our escape into the mountains.  This we attempted to\r\ndo soon afterwards; but the natives were now able to look after us, and\r\non our showing a disposition to avoid observation and make towards the\r\nmountains, we were seized by three warriors, who once more bound our\r\nwrists and thrust us into our former prison.\r\n\r\nIt is true Jack made a vigorous resistance, and knocked down the first\r\nsavage who seized him with a well-directed blow of his fist, but he was\r\nspeedily overpowered by others.  Thus we were again prisoners, with the\r\nprospect of torture and a violent death before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nIMPRISONMENT--SINKING HOPES--UNEXPECTED FREEDOM TO MORE THAN ONE, AND IN\r\nMORE SENSES THAN ONE.\r\n\r\nFor a long, long month we remained in our dark and dreary prison, during\r\nwhich dismal time we did not see the face of a human being except that\r\nof the silent savage who brought us our daily food.\r\n\r\nThere have been one or two seasons in my life during which I have felt\r\nas if the darkness of sorrow and desolation that crushed my inmost heart\r\ncould never pass away until death should make me cease to feel.  The\r\npresent was such a season.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of our confinement we felt a cold chill at our\r\nhearts every time we heard a footfall near the cave, dreading lest it\r\nshould prove to be that of our executioner.  But as time dragged heavily\r\non we ceased to feel this alarm, and began to experience such a deep,\r\nirrepressible longing for freedom that we chafed and fretted in our\r\nconfinement like tigers.  Then a feeling of despair came over us, and we\r\nactually longed for the time when the savages would take us forth to\r\ndie.  But these changes took place very gradually, and were mingled\r\nsometimes with brighter thoughts; for there were times when we sat, in\r\nthat dark cavern on our ledge of rock, and conversed almost pleasantly\r\nabout the past until we well-nigh forgot the dreary present.  But we\r\nseldom ventured to touch upon the future.\r\n\r\nA few decayed leaves and boughs formed our bed, and a scanty supply of\r\nyams and taro, brought to us once a day, constituted our food.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ralph, how have you slept?\" said Jack in a listless tone on\r\nrising one morning from his humble couch.  \"Were you much disturbed by\r\nthe wind last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I.  \"I dreamed of home all night, and I thought that my\r\nmother smiled upon me and beckoned me to go to her; but I could not, for\r\nI was chained.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I dreamed too,\" said Peterkin; \"but it was of our happy home on the\r\nCoral Island.  I thought we were swimming in the Water Garden.  Then the\r\nsavages gave a yell, and we were immediately in the cave at Spouting\r\nCliff, which, somehow or other changed into this gloomy cavern; and I\r\nawoke to find it true.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin's tone was so much altered by the depressing influence of his\r\nlong imprisonment that, had I not known it was he who spoke, I should\r\nscarcely have recognised it, so sad was it, and so unlike to the merry,\r\ncheerful voice we had been accustomed to hear.  I pondered this much,\r\nand thought of the terrible decline of happiness that may come on human\r\nbeings in so short a time; how bright the sunshine in the sky at one\r\ntime, and in a short space bow dark the overshadowing cloud!  I had no\r\ndoubt that the Bible would have given me much light and comfort on this\r\nsubject if I had possessed one, and I once more had occasion to regret\r\ndeeply having neglected to store my memory with its consoling truths.\r\n\r\nWhile I meditated thus, Peterkin again broke the silence of the cave by\r\nsaying, in a melancholy tone, \"Oh, I wonder if we shall ever see our\r\ndear island more!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled, and covering his face with both hands, he bent down\r\nhis head and wept.  It was an unusual sight for me to see our once\r\njoyous companion in tears, and I felt a burning desire to comfort him;\r\nbut, alas! what could I say?  I could hold out no hope; and although I\r\nessayed twice to speak, the words refused to pass my lips.  While I\r\nhesitated Jack sat down beside him and whispered a few words in his ear,\r\nwhile Peterkin threw himself on his friend's breast and rested his head\r\non his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThus we sat for some time in deep silence.  Soon after we heard\r\nfootsteps at the entrance of the cave, and immediately our jailer\r\nentered.  We were so much accustomed to his regular visits, however,\r\nthat we paid little attention to him, expecting that he would set down\r\nour meagre fare as usual and depart.  But, to our surprise, instead of\r\ndoing so, he advanced towards us with a knife in his hand, and going up\r\nto Jack, he cut the thongs that bound his wrists; then he did the same\r\nto Peterkin and me!  For fully five minutes we stood in speechless\r\namazement, with our freed hands hanging idly by our sides.  The first\r\nthought that rushed into my mind was that the time had come to put us to\r\ndeath; and although, as I have said before, we actually wished for death\r\nin the strength of our despair, now that we thought it drew really near\r\nI felt all the natural love of life revive in my heart, mingled with a\r\nchill of horror at the suddenness of our call.\r\n\r\nBut I was mistaken.  After cutting our bonds the savage pointed to the\r\ncave's mouth, and we marched, almost mechanically, into the open air.\r\nHere, to our surprise, we found the teacher standing under a tree, with\r\nhis hands clasped before him, and the tears trickling down his dark\r\ncheeks.  On seeing Jack, who came out first, he sprang towards him, and\r\nclasping him in his arms, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh my dear young friend, through the great goodness of God you are\r\nfree!\"\r\n\r\n\"Free?\" cried Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, free!\" repeated the teacher, shaking us warmly by the hands again\r\nand again--\"free to go and come as you will.  The Lord has unloosed the\r\nbonds of the captive, and set the prisoners free.  A missionary has been\r\nsent to us, and Tararo has embraced the Christian religion!  The people\r\nare even now burning their gods of wood!  Come, my dear friends, and see\r\nthe glorious sight!\"\r\n\r\nWe could scarcely credit our senses.  So long had we been accustomed, in\r\nour cavern, to dream of deliverance, that we imagined for a moment this\r\nmust surely be nothing more than another vivid dream.  Our eyes and\r\nminds were dazzled, too, by the brilliant sunshine, which almost blinded\r\nus after our long confinement to the gloom of our prison, so that we\r\nfelt giddy with the variety of conflicting emotions that filled our\r\nthrobbing bosoms; but as we followed the footsteps of our sable friend,\r\nand beheld the bright foliage of the trees, and heard the cries of the\r\nparoquets, and smelt the rich perfume of the flowering shrubs, the\r\ntruth--that we were really delivered from prison and from death--rushed\r\nwith overwhelming power into our souls, and with one accord, while tears\r\nsprang to our eyes, we uttered a loud, long cheer of joy.\r\n\r\nIt was replied to by a shout from a number of the natives who chanced to\r\nbe near.  Running towards us, they shook us by the hand with every\r\ndemonstration of kindly feeling.  They then fell behind, and forming a\r\nsort of procession, conducted us to the dwelling of Tararo.\r\n\r\nThe scene that met our eyes here was one that I shall never forget.  On\r\na rude bench in front of his house sat the chief.  A native stood on his\r\nleft hand, who from his dress seemed to be a teacher.  On his right\r\nstood an English gentleman, who I at once, and rightly, concluded was a\r\nmissionary.  He was tall, thin, and apparently past forty, with a bald\r\nforehead and thin grey hair.  The expression of his countenance was the\r\nmost winning I ever saw, and his clear grey eyes beamed with a look that\r\nwas frank, fearless, loving, and truthful.  In front of the chief was an\r\nopen space, in the centre of which lay a pile of wooden idols, ready to\r\nbe set on fire; and around these were assembled thousands of natives,\r\nwho had come to join in or to witness the unusual sight.  A bright smile\r\noverspread the missionary's face as he advanced quickly to meet us, and\r\nhe shook us warmly by the hands.\r\n\r\n\"I am overjoyed to meet you, my dear young friends,\" he said.  \"My\r\nfriend and _your_ friend, the teacher, has told me your history; and I\r\nthank our Father in heaven with all my heart, that He has guided me to\r\nthis island and made me the instrument of saving you.\"\r\n\r\nWe thanked the missionary most heartily, and asked him, in some\r\nsurprise, how he had succeeded in turning the heart of Tararo in our\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you that at a more convenient time,\" he answered,\r\n\"meanwhile we must not forget the respect due to the chief.  He waits to\r\nreceive you.\"\r\n\r\nIn the conversation that immediately followed between us and Tararo, the\r\nlatter said that the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ had been sent\r\nto the island, and that to it we were indebted for our freedom.\r\nMoreover, he told us that we were at liberty to depart in our schooner\r\nwhenever we pleased, and that we should be supplied with as much\r\nprovision as we required.  He concluded by shaking hands with us warmly,\r\nand performing the ceremony of rubbing noses.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed good news to us, and we could hardly find words to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the chief and to the missionary.\r\n\r\n\"And what of Avatea?\" inquired Jack.\r\n\r\nThe missionary replied by pointing to a group of natives, in the midst\r\nof whom the girl stood.  Beside her was a tall, strapping fellow, whose\r\nnoble mien and air of superiority bespoke him a chief of no ordinary\r\nkind.  \"That youth is her lover.  He came this very morning in his\r\nwar-canoe to treat with Tararo for Avatea.  He is to be married in a few\r\ndays, and afterwards returns to his island home with his bride.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's capital!\" said Jack as he stepped up to the savage and gave him\r\na hearty shake of the hand.  \"I wish you joy, my lad!--And you too,\r\nAvatea!\"\r\n\r\nAs Jack spoke, Avatea's lover took him by the hand and led him to the\r\nspot where Tararo and the missionary stood, surrounded by most of the\r\nchief men of the tribe.  The girl herself followed and stood on his left\r\nhand, while her lover stood on his right, and commanding silence, made\r\nthe following speech, which was translated by the missionary:\r\n\r\n\"Young friend, you have seen few years, but your head is old.  Your\r\nheart, also, is large and very brave.  I and Avatea are your debtors;\r\nand we wish, in the midst of this assembly, to acknowledge our debt, and\r\nto say that it is one which we can never repay.  You have risked your\r\nlife for one who was known to you only for a few days.  But she was a\r\nwoman in distress, and that was enough to secure to her the aid of a\r\nChristian man.  We, who live in these islands of the sea, know that the\r\ntrue Christians always act thus.  Their religion is one of love and\r\nkindness.  We thank God that so many Christians have been sent here: we\r\nhope many more will come.  Remember that I and Avatea will think of you,\r\nand pray for you and your brave comrades, when you are far away.\"\r\n\r\nTo this kind speech Jack returned a short, sailor-like reply, in which\r\nhe insisted that he had only done for Avatea what he would have done for\r\nany woman under the sun.  But Jack's forte did not lie in speech-making,\r\nso he terminated rather abruptly by seizing the chief's hand and shaking\r\nit violently, after which he made a hasty retreat.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, Ralph and Peterkin,\" said Jack as we mingled with the crowd,\r\n\"it seems to me that, the object we came here for having been\r\nsatisfactorily accomplished, we have nothing more to do but get ready\r\nfor sea as fast as we can, and hurrah for old England!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my idea precisely,\" said Peterkin, endeavouring to wink; but he\r\nhad wept so much of late, poor fellow, that he found it difficult.\r\n\"However, I'm not going away till I see these fellows burn their gods.\"\r\n\r\nPeterkin had his wish, for in a few minutes afterwards fire was put to\r\nthe pile, the roaring flames, ascended, and amid the acclamations of the\r\nassembled thousands, the false gods of Mango were reduced to ashes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nTo part is the lot of all mankind.  The world is a scene of constant\r\nleave-taking, and the hands that grasp in cordial greeting to-day are\r\ndoomed ere long to unite for the last time when the quivering lips\r\npronounce the word \"Farewell.\"  It is a sad thought, but should we on\r\nthat account exclude it from our minds?  May not a lesson worth learning\r\nbe gathered in the contemplation of it?  May it not, perchance, teach us\r\nto devote our thoughts more frequently and attentively to that land\r\nwhere we meet but part no more?\r\n\r\nHow many do we part from in this world with a light good-bye whom we\r\nnever see again!  Often do I think, in my meditations on this subject,\r\nthat if we realised more fully the shortness of the fleeting intercourse\r\nthat we have in this world with many of our fellow-men, we would try\r\nmore earnestly to do them good, to give them a friendly smile, as it\r\nwere, in passing (for the longest intercourse on earth is little more\r\nthan a passing word and glance), and show that we have sympathy with\r\nthem in the short, quick struggle of life by our kindly words and looks\r\nand actions.\r\n\r\nThe time soon drew near when we were to quit the islands of the South\r\nSeas; and strange though it may appear, we felt deep regret at parting\r\nwith the natives of the island of Mango, for after they embraced the\r\nChristian faith, they sought, by showing us the utmost kindness, to\r\ncompensate for the harsh treatment we had experienced at their hands.\r\nAnd we felt a growing affection for the native teachers and the\r\nmissionary, and especially for Avatea and her husband.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving we had many long and interesting conversations with the\r\nmissionary, in one of which he told us that he had been making for the\r\nisland of Rarotonga when his native-built sloop was blown out of its\r\ncourse, during a violent gale, and driven to this island.  At first the\r\nnatives refused to listen to what he had to say; but after a week's\r\nresidence among them, Tararo came to him and said that he wished to\r\nbecome a Christian and would burn his idols.  He proved himself to be\r\nsincere, for, as we have seen, he persuaded all his people to do\r\nlikewise.  I use the word \"persuaded\" advisedly, for, like all the other\r\nFeejee chiefs, Tararo was a despot, and might have commanded obedience\r\nto his wishes; but he entered so readily into the spirit of the new\r\nfaith that he perceived at once the impropriety of using constraint in\r\nthe propagation of it.  He set the example, therefore; and that example\r\nwas followed by almost every man of the tribe.\r\n\r\nDuring the short time that we remained at the island repairing our\r\nvessel and getting her ready for sea, the natives had commenced building\r\na large and commodious church under the superintendence of the\r\nmissionary, and several rows of new cottages were marked out; so that\r\nthe place bid fair to become, in a few months, as prosperous and\r\nbeautiful as the Christian village at the other end of the island.\r\n\r\nAfter Avatea was married, she and her husband were sent away loaded with\r\npresents, chiefly of an edible nature.  One of the native teachers went\r\nwith them, for the purpose of visiting still more distant islands of the\r\nsea, and spreading, if possible, the light of the glorious Gospel there.\r\n\r\nAs the missionary intended to remain for several weeks longer in order\r\nto encourage and confirm his new converts, Jack and Peterkin and I held\r\na consultation in the cabin of our schooner--which we found just as we\r\nhad left her, for everything that had been taken out of her was\r\nrestored.  We now resolved to delay our departure no longer.  The desire\r\nto see our beloved native land was strong upon us, and we could not\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nThree natives volunteered to go with us to Tahiti, where we thought it\r\nlikely that we should be able to procure a sufficient crew of sailors to\r\nman our vessel; so we accepted their offer gladly.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, clear morning when we hoisted the snow-white sails of\r\nthe pirate schooner and left the shores of Mango.  The missionary and\r\nthousands of the natives came down to bid us God-speed and to see us\r\nsail away.  As the vessel bent before a light, fair wind, we glided\r\nquickly over the lagoon under a cloud of canvas.\r\n\r\nJust as we passed through the channel in the reef the natives gave us a\r\nloud cheer; and as the missionary waved his hat, while he stood on a\r\ncoral rock with his grey hairs floating in the wind, we heard the single\r\nword \"Farewell\" borne faintly over the sea.\r\n\r\nThat night, as we sat on the taffrail gazing out upon the wide sea and\r\nup into the starry firmament, a thrill of joy, strangely mixed with\r\nsadness, passed through our hearts; for we were at length \"homeward\r\nbound\" and were gradually leaving far behind us the beautiful,\r\nbright-green coral islands of the Pacific Ocean.",
