I think it was a good\r\none. Whether it be owing to our style of living now-a-days, which tends\r\nmore to the development of brain than muscle; or whether it be, as Darwin\r\nsays, that we really are descended from the ape, and, as the years roll\r\non, are losing that essentially animal virtue--patience; certainly it is\r\ntrue that we cannot tolerate prefaces, preludes, and long graces before\r\nmeat, as our grandfathers did. A preface, like Curaçoa--and--B, before\r\ndinner, ought to be short and sweet: something merely to give an edge to\r\nappetite, or it had as well be put in the \"end entoirely,\" or better\r\nstill, in the fire.\r\n\r\nI presume, then, the reader is fond of the domestic cat; if only for the\r\nsimple reason that God made it. Yes; God made it, and man mars it. Pussy\r\nis an ill-used, much persecuted, little understood, and greatly slandered\r\nanimal. It is with the view, therefore, of gaining for our little fireside\r\nfriend a greater meed of justice than she has hitherto obtained, of\r\nremoving the ban under which she mostly lives, and making her life a more\r\npleasant and happy one, that the following pages are written; and I shall\r\ndeem it a blessing if I am _in any way_ successful. I have tried to paint\r\npussy just as she is, without the aid of \"putty and varnish;\" and I have\r\nbeen at no small pains to prove the authenticity of the various anecdotes,\r\nand can assure the reader that they are all _strictly true_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n[_See Note B, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nPUSSY ON HER NATIVE HEARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't have surprised me a bit, doctor,\" said my gallant captain to\r\nme, on the quarter-deck of the saucy _Pen-gun_,--\"It wouldn't have\r\nsurprised me a bit, if they had sent you on board, minus the head. A nice\r\nthing that would have been, with so many hands sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"And rather unconvenient for me,\" I added, stroking my neck.\r\n\r\nI had been explaining to the gentleman, that my reason for not being off\r\nthe night before, was my finding myself on the desert side of the gates of\r\nAden after sun-down. A strange motley cut-throat band I had found myself\r\namong, too. Wild Somalis, half-caste Indian Jews, Bedouin Arabs, and burly\r\nPersian merchants, all armed with sword and spear and shield, and long\r\nrifles that, judging by their build, seemed made to shoot round corners.\r\nStrings of camels lay on the ground; and round each camp-fire squatted\r\nthese swarthy sons of the desert, engaged in talking, eating, smoking, or\r\nquarrelling, as the case might be. Unless at Falkirk tryst, I had never\r\nbeen among such a parcel of rogues in my life. I myself was armed to the\r\nteeth: that is, I had nothing but my tongue wherewith to defend myself. I\r\ncould not help a feeling of insecurity taking possession of me; there\r\nseemed to be a screw that wanted tightening somewhere about my neck. Yet I\r\ndo not now repent having spent that night in the desert, as it has\r\nafforded me the opportunity of settling that long-disputed question--the\r\norigin of the domestic cat.\r\n\r\nSome have searched Egyptian annals for the origin of their pet, some\r\nPersian, and some assert they can trace its descent from the days of Noah.\r\nI can go a long way beyond that. It is difficult to get over the flood,\r\nthough; but I suppose my typical cat belonged to some one of the McPherson\r\nclan. McPhlail was telling McPherson, that he could trace his genealogy\r\nfrom the days of Noah.\r\n\r\n\"And mine,\" said the rival clansman, \"from nine hundred years before\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the flood, you know?\" hinted the McPhlail.\r\n\r\n\"And did you ever hear of a Phairson that hadn't a boat of his own?\" was\r\nthe indignant retort.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a group of young Arabs, was one that attracted my special\r\nattention. He was an old man who looked, with his snow-white beard, his\r\nturban and robes, as venerable as one of Doré's patriarchs. In sonorous\r\ntones, in his own noble language, he was reading from a book in his lap,\r\nwhile one arm was coiled lovingly round a beautiful long-haired cat.\r\nBeside this man I threw myself down. The fierceness of his first glance,\r\nwhich seemed to resent my intrusion, melted into a smile as sweet as a\r\nwoman's, when I began to stroke and admire his cat. Just the same story\r\nall the world over,--praise a man's pet and he'll do anything for you;\r\nfight for you, or even lend you money. That Arab shared his supper with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my son,\" he said, \"more than my goods, more than my horse, I love my\r\ncat. She comforts me. More than the smoke she soothes me. Allah is great\r\nand good; when our first mother and father went out into the mighty desert\r\nalone, He gave them two friends to defend and comfort them--the dog and\r\nthe cat. In the body of the cat He placed the spirit of a gentle woman; in\r\nthe dog the soul of a brave man. It is true, my son; the book hath it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this I remained for some time speculatively silent.\r\n\r\nThe old man's story may be taken--according to taste--with or without a\r\ngrain of salt; but we must admit it is as good a way of accounting for\r\ndomestic pussy's origin as any other.\r\n\r\nThere really is, moreover, a great deal of the woman's nature in the cat.\r\nLike a woman, pussy prefers a settled home to leading a roving life. Like\r\na true woman, she is fond of fireside comforts. Then she is so gentle in\r\nall her ways, so kind, so loving, and so forgiving. On your return from\r\nbusiness, the very look of her honest face, as she sits purring on the\r\nhearth-rug, with the pleasant adjuncts of a bright fire and hissing\r\ntea-urn, tends to make you forget all the cares of the day. When you are\r\ndull and lonely, how often does her \"punky humour,\" her mirth-provoking\r\nattitudes and capers banish ennui. And if you are ill, how carefully she\r\nwill watch by your bedside and keep you company. How her low song will\r\nlull you, her soft caresses soothe you, giving you more real consolation\r\nfrom the looks of concern exhibited on her loving little face, than any\r\nlanguage could convey.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, like a woman, she is prying and curious. A locked\r\ncupboard is often a greater source of care and thought to pussy, than the\r\nsecret chamber was to the wife of Blue Beard. I'm sure it is only because\r\nshe cannot read that she refrains from opening your letters of a morning,\r\nand only because she cannot speak that she keeps a secret. Like a woman,\r\ntoo, she dearly loves a gossip, and will have it too, even if it be by\r\nnight on the tiles, at the risk of keeping the neighbours awake. Oh! I'm\r\nfar from sure that the Arab isn't right, after all.\r\n\r\nPussy, from the very day she opens her wondering eyes and stares vacantly\r\naround her, becomes an object worthy of study and observation. Indeed,\r\nkittens, even before their eyes are opened, will know your voice or hand,\r\nand spit at a stranger's. The first year of pussy's existence is certainly\r\nthe happiest. No creature in the world is so fond of fun and mischief as a\r\nkitten. Everything that moves or is movable, from its mother's tail to the\r\ntable-cloth, must minister to its craze for a romp; but what pen could\r\ndescribe its intense joy, its pride and self-satisfaction, when, for the\r\nfirst time it has caught a real live mouse? This is as much an episode in\r\nthe life of a kitten, as her first ball is to a young lady just out. Nor\r\ndo well-trained and properly-fed cats ever lose this innate sense of fun,\r\nand love of the ridiculous. They lose their teeth first. I have seen\r\ndemure old cats, of respectable matronly aspect,--cats that ought to have\r\nknown better,--leave their kittens when only a day old, and gambol\r\nround the room after a cork till tired and giddy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK and WHITE.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by J. BRADDEN, ESQ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD CAT (Half-Bred).\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by A. H. SEAGER, ESQ.]\r\n\r\nCats of the right sort never fail to bring their kittens up in the way\r\nthey should go, and soon succeed in teaching them all they know\r\nthemselves. They will bring in living mice for them, and always take more\r\npride in the best warrior-kitten than in the others. They will also\r\ninculcate the doctrine of cleanliness in their kits, so that the carpet\r\nshall never be wet. I have often been amused at seeing my own cat bringing\r\nkitten after kitten to the sand-box, and showing it how to use it, in\r\naction explaining to them what it was there for. When a little older, she\r\nentices them out to the garden.\r\n\r\nCats can easily be taught to be polite and well-mannered. It depends upon\r\nyourself, whether you allow your favourite to sit either on your shoulder\r\nor on the table at meal-times, or to wait demurely on the hearth till you\r\nhave finished. In any case, her appetite should never get the better of\r\nher good manners.\r\n\r\n\"We always teach our cats,\" writes a lady to me, \"to wait patiently while\r\nthe family are at their meals, after which they are served. Although we\r\nnever keep a dish for them standing in a corner, as some people do, yet we\r\nnever had a cat-thief. Our Tom and Topsy used to sit on a chair beside my\r\nbrother, near the table, with only their heads under the level of it. They\r\nwould peep up occasionally to see if the meal were nearly over; but on\r\nbeing reminded that their time had not come, they would immediately close\r\ntheir eyes and feign to be asleep.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Tom knew the time my brother came in from business, and if five\r\nor ten minutes past his time, he would go to the door and listen, then\r\ncome back to the fireside showing every symptom of impatience and anxiety.\r\nHe knew the footsteps of every member of the family, and would start up,\r\nbefore the human ear could detect a sound, and hasten to the door to\r\nwelcome the comer. He knew the knock of people who were frequent visitors,\r\nand would greet the knock of a stranger with an angry growl.\r\n\r\n\"Tom would never eat a mouse until he had shown it to some member of the\r\nfamily, and been requested to eat it; and although brought up in a country\r\nvillage, made himself perfectly at home in Glasgow, although living on the\r\nthird floor. But poor faithful fellow, after sticking to us through all\r\nthe varied changes of fourteen years, one wintry morning--he had been out\r\nall night--when I drew up the window to call him, he answered me with such\r\na plaintive voice, that I at once hastened down to see what was the\r\nmatter. He was lying helpless and bleeding among the snow, with one leg\r\nbroken. He died.\"\r\n\r\nCats will often attach themselves to some one member of a family in\r\npreference to all others. They are as a rule more fond of children than\r\ngrown-up people, and usually lavish more affection on a woman than a man.\r\nThey have particular tastes too, as regards some portions of the house in\r\nwhich they reside, often selecting some room or corner of a room which\r\nthey make their \"sanctum sanctorum.\"\r\n\r\nTalking of her cats, a lady correspondent says:--\"Toby's successor was a\r\nblack and white kitten we called Jenny. Jenny was considered my father's\r\ncat, as she followed him and no one else. Our house and that of an aunt\r\nwere near to each other, and on Sabbath mornings it was my father's\r\ninvariable custom to walk in the garden, closely followed by Jenny,\r\nafterwards going in to visit his sister before going to church. Jenny\r\nenjoyed those visits amazingly; every one was so fond of her, and she was\r\nso much admired, that she began to pay them visits of her own accord upon\r\nweekdays. I am sorry to say that Jenny eventually abused the hospitality\r\nthus held out to her. For, as time wore on, pussy had, unknown to us, been\r\nmaking her own private arrangements for an event of great interest which\r\nwas to occur before very long. And this is how it was discovered when it\r\ndid come off. Some ladies had been paying my aunt a visit, and the\r\nconversation not unnaturally turned on dress.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh! but,' said my aunt, 'you must have a sight of my new velvet\r\nbonnet,--so handsome,--one pound fifteen shillings,--and came from\r\nLondon. I do trust it won't rain on Sunday. Eliza, go for the box under\r\nthe dressing-table in the spare bedroom.'\r\n\r\n\"Although the door of this room was kept constantly shut, the window was\r\nopened by day to admit the fresh air. It admitted more,--it admitted\r\nJenny,--and Jenny did not hesitate to avail herself of the convenience of\r\nhaving her kittens in that room.\r\n\r\n\"Eliza had not been gone five minutes, when she returned screaming,--'Oh,\r\nmurther! murther!' that is all she said. She just ran back again,\r\nscreaming the same words, and my aunt and friends hastened after her. The\r\nsight that met their gaze was in no way alarming: it was only Jenny cosily\r\nensconced in the box--the bonnet altered in shape to suit\r\ncircumstances--looking the picture of innocence and joy as she sung to six\r\nblind kittens.\r\n\r\n\"Summary and condign was the punishment that fell on the unlucky Jenny.\r\nThe kittens were ordered to be instantly drowned,--we managed to save just\r\none,--and pussy sentenced to be executed as soon as the gardener came in\r\nthe morning. This sentence was afterwards commuted to transportation for\r\nlife from my aunt's house; and it was remarkable, that although Jenny took\r\nher Sabbath morning walks as usual with my father, she never entered my\r\naunt's dwelling, but waited patiently until my father came out.\" Jenny's\r\nmaster died.\r\n\r\n\"Jenny seemed to miss my father greatly. She used to go to the garden on a\r\nSunday, as usual, but walked up and down disconsolate and sad; and on her\r\nreturn would take up her old position outside my aunt's door, and wait and\r\nwait, always thinking he would surely come. This constant waiting and\r\nwatching for him that would come again no more, was the first thing that\r\nsoftened my aunt's heart to poor Jenny; and she was freely forgiven for\r\nthe destruction of the velvet bonnet, and took up her abode for life with\r\nmy aunt, on whom she bestowed all the affection she had previously\r\nlavished on my father.\"\r\n\r\nKittens, like the young of most animals--mankind included--are sometimes\r\nrather selfish towards their parents. A large kitten that I knew, used to\r\nbe regularly fed with mice which its mother caught and brought to it from\r\na stack-yard. Instead of appearing grateful, he used to seize the mouse\r\nand, running growling to a corner, devour the whole of it. His mother must\r\nhave thought this rather unfair, for after standing it three or four\r\ntimes, she brought in the mouse, and slapped him if he dared to touch it\r\nuntil she had eaten her share--the hind quarters; then he had to be\r\ncontent with the rest.\r\n\r\nI knew of a cat that, in order to avoid the punishment which she thought\r\nshe merited on committing an offence, adopted the curious expedient of\r\nhaving two homes. Her failing was fish. If there had been no fish in the\r\nworld, she would have been a strictly honest cat. She warred against the\r\ntemptation, but it was of no use; the spirit was willing but the flesh\r\nweak, and the smell of fish not to be resisted. As long as she could steal\r\nwithout being found out, it was all right, things went on smoothly; but\r\nwhenever she was caught tripping, she bade good-bye for a time to that\r\nhome, and took up her quarters at the other, distant about half a mile.\r\nHere she would reside for a month or more, as the case might be, until the\r\ntheft of another haddock or whiting caused her to return to the other\r\nhouse. And so on; this cat kept up the habit of fluctuating backwards and\r\nforwards, between her two homes, as long as she lived. She was never\r\nthrashed, and, I think, did not deserve to be.\r\n\r\nIt is a common thing for a she-cat, if her kittens are all drowned, to\r\ntake to suckling a former kitten--even a grown-up son has sometimes to\r\nresume the office and duties of baby to a bereaved mother, and is in\r\ngeneral no ways loath to do so. There is a horrid cat in a village in\r\nYorkshire, who, every time his mother has kittens, steals them, taking\r\nthem one by one to the cellar, and eating them. When there are no more to\r\neat, filial piety constrains him to suckle his dam, until she deems it fit\r\nthat he should be weaned. He has been weaned already four times, to my\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIf a kitten has been given away, and for some reason or other returns\r\nagain to its mother's home, the first thing that mother does is to give\r\nhim a sound hiding, afterwards she receives him into favour, and gives him\r\nher tail to play with by way of _solatium_. Mothers will sometimes correct\r\ntheir very young kittens; for instance, if it squeals when she wants to\r\nget away for a short time, two or three smart pats with a mittened paw\r\ngenerally make it go fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cat's love of fun is perhaps one of the most endearing traits in her\r\ncharacter. Who has not laughed to see the antics performed by some pet\r\ncat, whom its mistress wished to bring into the house for the night. Pussy\r\nhas been walking with her mistress in the garden; but the night is fair\r\nand moonlit, and she hasn't the slightest intention of coming in, for at\r\nleast half-an-hour yet. So round the walks she flies, romping and\r\nrollicking, with tail in the air, and eyes crimson and green with the\r\nmischief that is in them; always popping out when least expected, and\r\nsometimes brushing the lady's very skirts. Now she walks demurely up to\r\nher mistress, as if soliciting capture, and just as she is being picked\r\nup,--\"Ah! you thought you had me, did you?\" and off she scampers to the\r\nother end of the garden. Anon, she is up a tree, and grinning like an elf\r\nfrom the topmost branches; and no amount of pet names, blarney, or coaxing\r\nwill entice her down or into the house until, as they say in the north,\r\nher ain de'il bids her. Pussy's fondness for frolic has led to strange\r\nresults sometimes, as the following will testify:--\r\n\r\nIn an old-fashioned house, in an old-fashioned parish, in the county of\r\nAberdeenshire, there lived, not many years ago, a farmer of the name of\r\nD----. His family consisted of his wife, two marriageable daughters, and a\r\nbeautiful tabby cat. This cat was well fed and cared for, and being so,\r\nwas an excellent mouser. Indeed, it was averred by the farmer that no rat\r\nwould live within a mile of her. The house stood by itself some distance\r\noff the road, but, though surrounded by lofty pine-trees, it had by no\r\nmeans the appearance of a place, which a ghost of average intellect and\r\nany claim to respectability would select, as the scene of its midnight\r\nperegrinations. Besides, there was no story attached to the house. No one\r\nhad ever been murdered there, so far as was known. No old miser had ever\r\nresided within its walls; and though several members of the family had\r\ndied in the old box-bed, they had all passed away in the most legitimate\r\nmanner. Old granny was the only one at all likely to come back; but what\r\ncould she have forgotten? The old lady was sensible to the last, and\r\nbehaved like a brick. She told them candidly she was \"wearin' awa';\" sat\r\nup in bed and in a sadly quavering voice sang the Old Hundred; then handed\r\nover the key of the tea-caddy, where she kept her \"trifle siller,\" with\r\nthe remark that they would find among the rest two old pennies, which she\r\nhad kept especially to be placed in her eyes when her \"candle went out.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, however, the honest farmer and his family were all\r\nawakened one night by hearing the parlour bell rung, and rung too with\r\ngreat force. They couldn't all have been dreaming. Besides, while they\r\nwere yet doubting and deliberating, lo! the bell rung a second time. John\r\nand his wife shook in their shoes. That is merely a figure of speech; for,\r\nproperly speaking, they hadn't even their stockings on. The marriageable\r\ndaughters would have fainted, but they had only read of fainting in books,\r\nand had no idea how it was done. It must be allowed matters were alarming\r\nenough. Who or what dreadful thing was thus urgently demanding an\r\ninterview at that untimely hour of night, in that lone house among the\r\npine-trees. The bell rang a third time; and, urged by the entreaties of\r\nhis wife to be brave for once and go--she did not say come--and see, John\r\nat last reached down his old brown Bess--it had been loaded for five\r\nyears--and with a candle in his other hand, his wife holding on by the\r\nskirts of his night-dress, and the marriageable daughters bringing up the\r\nrear, prepared to march upon the parlour.\r\n\r\nIn Indian file, and all in white, they might have been mistaken for a\r\nparty of priests going to celebrate midnight mass. No ghost could have\r\nwithstood the sight of that procession. It must have burst out laughing,\r\nunless, indeed, a very _grave_ ghost. When at last they reached the\r\nparlour, neither sight nor sound rewarded them for their heroism.\r\nEverything was in its usual place, and nothing was disturbed. A search all\r\nover the house proved too that the doors were all locked, the windows\r\nfastened, and no one either up the chimney or under the beds. So the\r\nmystery was put down to super-human agency, or, as the good wife termed\r\nit, \"something no canny;\" and they all went trembling back to bed, and lay\r\nawake in great fear till the cock crew.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a fortnight after this, almost every night, and sometimes even\r\nby day, the same strange disturbances occurred, and all efforts to solve\r\nthe mystery were fruitless. So it got rumoured abroad that the house was\r\nhaunted. All the usual remedies were had recourse to for the purpose of\r\nexorcism, but in vain. The parson came twice to pray in the room. He might\r\nas well have stopped at home. Equally unsuccessful were the services of an\r\nold lady, whom her enemies called a witch, her friends \"the wisest woman\r\nin the parish.\" Things began to look serious. The goodwife was getting\r\nthin, her daughters hysterical, and John himself began to lose caste among\r\nthe neighbours. It was openly hinted, that some deed of blood must have\r\nbeen committed by him, in that same house and room. Nor could his thirty\r\nyears of married life and unblemished reputation save him. He had been\r\n_too_ quiet, people said, and _too_ regular in his attendance at church;\r\nbesides, he had a down look about him, and, on the whole, hanging was too\r\ngood for him. Some averred that strange sights and sounds were seen and\r\nheard by people who had occasion to pass that house at night, among other\r\nthings a light gliding about in the copse-wood. No, they would not believe\r\nit was only John locking up the stable; and the devil himself, in the\r\nshape of a fox, was seen at early morning coming directly from the house.\r\nOf course the devil had a fine fat hen over his shoulders, but that had\r\nnothing to do with the matter. Poor John! it had come to this, that he had\r\nserious thoughts of giving up his farm and going to America, when a\r\nrollicking young student in the neighbourhood, who did not believe in\r\nspirits--except ardent--proposed to the farmer that they should \"wake the\r\nghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wake the ghost!\" said the farmer, \"ye little ken, lad. He's wide enough\r\nawake already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wake him,\" repeated the student; \"sit up at night, you know, and wait\r\ntill he comes.\"\r\n\r\nJohn turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"I'll sit with you,\" continued the young man. \"If he's a civil ghost, we\r\ncan hear what he has got to say; for\r\n\r\n  'The darkest nicht I fear nae deil,\r\n     Warlock, nor witch in Gowrie.'\"\r\n\r\nVery reluctantly John consented; but he did consent; and that night the\r\ntwo met in the haunted chamber alone, just before the old clock on the\r\nstair told the hour of midnight.\r\n\r\n\"What have you got under your arm?\" inquired the student.\r\n\r\n\"The ha' Bible,\" replied John, in a sepulchral voice; \"is that a Bible\r\nyou've brought?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's whisky,\" said the student, \"about the only spirit you are likely\r\nto see to-night; and there won't be the ghost of that left by cock-crow.\"\r\n\r\nSo they waited and watched, John reading, the student smoking steadily and\r\ndrinking periodically. One o'clock came, and two o'clock, and the candle\r\nwas burning low in the socket, when suddenly, \"Hist!\" said the student,\r\nand \"Hush!\" said John. They could distinctly hear footsteps about them in\r\nthe room, but no one visible. They were really frightened now. Then\r\nsomething rushed past them, and the bell rang, and there, lo, and behold!\r\nfrom the rope dangled John's decent tabby cat.\r\n\r\n\"And the Lord's name be praised,\" said John piously, closing the book.\r\n\r\n\"Such ghosts as these,\" said the student, \"are best exorcised with a\r\nbroom-handle; but, see! this explains.\" He held up the rope, to the end of\r\nwhich--country fashion--was attached _a hare's foot_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n[_See Note C, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nPUSSY'S LOVE OF CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cat is more than any other creature the pet of our early years. Almost\r\nthe first animal we notice, when we are old enough to notice anything, is\r\npussy, with her beautiful markings, her well-pleased, homely face, sleek\r\nand shining fur, and soft paws, which she never ungloves in the presence\r\nof childhood. Children and cats, especially young ones, have so very much\r\nin common. Both are innocent, sinless, and easily pleased, and both are\r\nfull of fun and frolic. Children will often play with a kitten until they\r\nkill the poor thing. In the country, pussy's place may easily be supplied\r\nby some other toy; but to a poor little gutter-child the loss is simply\r\nirreparable, and she will nurse her dead kitten in the mud for a week. The\r\nway children use poor patient pussy is at times anything but commendable;\r\nand while deprecating the conduct of parents in allowing them to treat\r\nthe cat so, we cannot but admire pussy's extreme forbearance and\r\nuncomplaining good nature, under what must be considered very trying\r\ncircumstances. It is nothing to see Miss Puss or Master Tom dressed up in\r\na shawl and neatly fitting cap, and lugged about as a doll, carried by the\r\ntail over the child's shoulder, or worn as a comforter round his neck. Yet\r\npussy seems to know that there is no harm meant, and that the children\r\nreally love her dearly; so she never attempts to scratch, far less to\r\nbite. All experience goes to prove, too, that it is generally the child\r\nthat uses her the worst, to whom pussy is most attached.\r\n\r\nThe 'dead playmate' is a picture you will often see in real life. I saw\r\none not a month ago. A pretty little child, with round, wondering eyes,\r\nswollen with recent tears, sitting in the corner of a field in the summer\r\nsunshine. On her lap lay--among a handful of daisies and corn-poppies--a\r\nwee dead kitten: life had but lately left it. When I spoke to her, her\r\ngrief burst out afresh.\r\n\r\n\"O sir, my pussy's deadëd, my pretty pussy's deadëd!\"\r\n\r\nThere would be no more games of romps in the garden, no more scampering\r\ntogether through the green fields after the butterfly, no more making\r\npussy a doll. She would go lonely to bed to-night and cry herself asleep,\r\nfor pretty pussy was \"deadëd.\"\r\n\r\nIn the adjacent street to where I now live, is a fine large red-tabby Tom.\r\nHe is a famous mouser, a noted hunter, and a gentleman every inch. He was\r\nfaithful in love and dauntless in war. When I tried to stroke him, he gave\r\nme a look and a growl of such unmistakable meaning, that I mechanically\r\nput my hands in my pockets and whistled. He makes no friends with\r\nstrangers. Yet Tom has a little mistress, not much over three years old,\r\nwhom he dearly loves, and from whom he is seldom absent. He lies down on\r\nhis side, and allows little Alice to lift him, although she can hardly\r\ntotter along with her burden, which she carries as often by the tail as\r\nany way else. She sleeps beside him on the hearth-rug, Tom winding his\r\narms lovingly around her neck, and little Alice declares that pussy\r\n\"carries his kisses on his nose.\"\r\n\r\nWee Elsie S----, though only six years old, has completely tamed--as far\r\nas she herself is concerned--what might almost be called a wild cat, it\r\nhaving been bred and brought up in the woods. This cat has only two good\r\nqualities, namely, his great skill in vermin-killing, and his fondness for\r\nlittle Elsie. Neither the child's father, mother, nor the servants, dare\r\nput a finger on this wild brindled Tom; but as soon as Elsie comes down in\r\nthe morning, and puss is let in, with a fond cry he rushes towards her,\r\nsinging and caressing her with evident satisfaction. He then does duty as\r\na doll all day, or follows the child wherever she goes, and sleeps with\r\nher when she sleeps.\r\n\r\n\"In our nursery,\" writes a lady correspondent, \"there was always a cat,\r\nwhich was the favourite companion of the children, submitting to many\r\nindignities which a dog would scarcely have endured with so much patience.\r\nOne handsome tabby cat, named by us children Roland the Brave, used to\r\nhold his place in front of the nursery fire, with the utmost patience and\r\ngood-humour, in spite of kettles boiling over on him, nursery-maids\r\ntreading on his paws and tail, and children teasing him in every possible\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tom-cat which I have at present,\" says another, \"keeps my children\r\ncompany in their walks, and is indeed more careful of them than the maid,\r\nwho sometimes has forgotten her duty so far as to leave the perambulator\r\nto look after itself, while she is talking and laughing with a tall man in\r\nred. But Tom is not so thoughtless, and sticks close by the children,\r\nshowing signs of anger when any one approaches. He seems, moreover, imbued\r\nwith the idea, that the every-day food of that domestic quadruped, the\r\ndog, is babies, and, if any one is foolish enough to come snuffing round\r\nthe perambulator, Tom mounts him at once, and proceeds forthwith to\r\nsharpen his claws in his hide. On one occasion when my family were absent\r\nfor a few days, Tom was so disconsolate that he refused to take his food.\r\nTo show his love for the children, I made the remark to Tom, in presence\r\nof some friends, that baby was in the cradle; the cat jumped up and went\r\ndirectly towards it, and examined it, then returned mewing most mournfully\r\nbecause of the disappointment.\"\r\n\r\nPussy's love for babies is always very noticeable. In fact, with very\r\nlittle training, she may be taught, if not to nurse, at least to mind, the\r\nbaby. I know a cat which, as soon as the child is placed in its little\r\ncot, lays itself gently down at its back; and this is not for sake of\r\nwarmth and comfort, as some may allege, but from pure love of baby. For\r\npussy lies perfectly still as long as the child sleeps; but whenever she\r\nawakes, even before she cries, the cat jumps down and runs to tell her\r\nmistress, runs back to the cradle, and, with her forefeet on the edge,\r\nlooks alternately at baby and its mother, mewing entreatingly until the\r\nchild is lifted. Contented now, it throws itself at the mother's feet, and\r\ngoes quietly off to sleep. Another cat I know of, that goes regularly to\r\nthe harvest-field, with its mistress and a young child. The cat remains\r\nwith the child all day, guarding him and amusing him by playing at\r\nhide-and-seek with him, until evening, when the mother, who has only\r\nvisited her child two or three times during the day, returns, generally to\r\nfind baby and puss asleep in each other's arms.\r\n\r\nCats too not only mourn the absence of their little master or mistress,\r\nbut will try to follow them if they can.\r\n\r\n\"A certain party of my acquaintance,\" says a lady, \"had a large cat called\r\nTabby, who was a great favourite with all the family. Tabby seemed to\r\nreciprocate the attachment of the different members, but its fondness for\r\nthe youngest daughter was something wonderful. It would follow her about\r\nwherever she went, and if she ever left home for a short time, poor pussy\r\nseemed quite wretched until her return. At one time the child went to\r\nreside for two months, with some friends many miles distant. You may fancy\r\nher surprise and delight when one morning, after she had been about a\r\nweek in her new residence, in marches her dear friend and companion\r\nMistress Tabby, and nothing could induce her to leave again. Pussy took up\r\nher abode with the girl, stuck by her all the time, and at the end of the\r\nvisit faithfully accompanied her back to their home.\"\r\n\r\nA woman, whom I know, has a tom-cat, which watches constantly by the\r\nbaby's cradle, when its mistress is absent. One day, when hanging up some\r\nclothes in the garden, she became suddenly aware of an awful row going on\r\nin the room she had just left. She entered, just in time to see Tom riding\r\na large shepherd's collie round the room, and back again, and finally out\r\nat the door. Tom was a most cruel jockey, sparing neither bit(e) nor spur,\r\nas the howls of the unhappy collie fully testified. That dog hasn't been\r\nseen in the immediate vicinity since.\r\n\r\nThe cat, mentioned in the following anecdote, was surely worthy of the\r\nHumane Society's bronze medallion, as much as any Newfoundland ever was.\r\n\r\nA certain lady's little son was ill of scarlet fever. The period of\r\ninflammation and danger was just over, but the poor child was unable to\r\nsit or stand. Through all his illness, he had been carefully watched by a\r\nfaithful tom-cat, who seldom ever left his bedside by night or by day; for\r\nTom dearly loved the little fellow, who, though now so still and quiet,\r\nused to lark and roll with him on the parlour floor. But since his little\r\nmaster's illness, Tom had never been known to make the slightest attempt\r\nat fun. One day, the child was taken by its mother from bed, and laid on\r\nthe cool sofa by way of change; and when he had fallen asleep she gently\r\nleft the room, Tom being on guard as usual. She had not been gone many\r\nminutes, and was engaged in some household duties, when Tom entered,\r\nsquirrel-tailed and mewing most piteously, looking up into her face, and\r\nthen running to the door, plainly entreating his mistress to hurry along\r\nwith him. It was well she did so. Poor Tom ran before her to the room in\r\nwhich she had left her boy, when she found that, in attempting to get up,\r\nthe child had fallen on the floor along with the rugs in such a position,\r\nthat death from suffocation would have inevitably followed, but for the\r\ntimely aid summoned by this noble tom-cat.\r\n\r\nI think I have said enough to prove how fond pussy is of children, and how\r\nforbearing towards them; and surely this trait in her character should\r\nendear her to us all. But I do thoroughly deprecate pussy's being made a\r\nplaything of, whether she be cat or kitten. It is exceedingly cruel of\r\nparents to allow it, and is taking an unfair advantage of the cat's\r\ngood-nature and sense. The way she is lugged about, and tormented by some\r\nchildren, is very prejudicial to her health and appearance. It often does\r\nher grievous bodily harm, injures her heart and lungs, and stops her\r\ngrowth, even if it does not induce paralysis and consequent death. Let\r\nyour children love pussy, pussy loves your children; only kindly point out\r\nto them the essential difference between a play_thing_ and a play_mate_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n[_See Note D, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nPUSSY \"POLL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following sketch of cat-life is contributed by one who loves \"all\r\nthings both great and small.\" We give it _in extenso_.\r\n\r\nEven supposing it to be endowed with the nine lives ascribed to the race,\r\nwas it at all probable that I would be successful in rearing to mature\r\ncathood that dripping little wretch?\r\n\r\nSuch was the question, which not without doubt, I asked myself while\r\nattempting to dry a kitten, some two weeks old, which I had just saved\r\nfrom death in a neighbouring horsepond. Arrived at home, I put in practice\r\nas many of the Royal Humane Society's rules for the treatment of the\r\napparently drowned, as I found applicable to the case in hand, and soon\r\nhad the satisfaction of seeing my charge, comfortably sleeping in a bed\r\nprepared in an old cap, by the fireside. Not less successful were my\r\nefforts at nursing, and in a few weeks, Poll, for so I named my pet, had\r\ngrown to be the daintiest thing possible; the very impersonation of\r\nmischief and fun, without thought or care, from morn till night, except\r\nthat of--\r\n\r\n  \"Turning to mirth all things of earth,\r\n    As only kittens can.\"\r\n\r\nTime passed on, however, and with years, or rather months, came troubles,\r\none of the first causes of which to puss was a mirror. To her it was a\r\nmystery which cost many hours of deep thought and serious study; but never\r\ncould she understand why the cat which was always visible in front could\r\nneither be seen, felt, nor heard, behind the glass.\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments were made to solve the puzzle; but the most common\r\none was for Poll to seat herself in front of the mirror and critically\r\nexamine her _vis-à-vis_. The thing seeming so real, she next would give\r\nthe glass a pat with her paw, and run round to the back; but nothing being\r\nfound there, one paw was then put in front and the other kept behind. She\r\nwould then peep round into the glass, and still seeing puss there, would\r\nrenew her efforts to catch her. This was repeated almost daily for some\r\ntime; but at last puss seemed to have resolved that the mystery should\r\nremain one no longer, so struck at her opponent with full force, and of\r\ncourse seemed to receive a blow in return. In an instant Poll sprang to\r\nher feet and assumed a position of defiance; but her foe, nothing loath\r\nfor the fray, was equally ready. A moment's pause, and puss hurled herself\r\non her foe. There was a crash. A cat rushed wildly out of the door, and I\r\nproceeded to gather fragments of a mirror from off the floor.\r\n\r\nAt meal-times, puss regularly seated herself on my shoulder, and waited\r\npatiently for what she considered her due proportion; but if I seemed to\r\nneglect her, she gently reminded me of her presence by patting my cheek\r\nwith her paw. If that was not sufficient, the paw was pressed on my cheek,\r\nthe claws slowly protruded, and my face drawn round towards her. Success\r\ninvariably attended this manoeuvre; and after receiving her share, she\r\nthanked me by rubbing her head against my cheek, and licking my face.\r\n\r\nIn due course a young family of kittens appeared; but of course they all,\r\nsave one, met the fate from which I had saved their mother. With the\r\nfamily came family cares. Soon the kitten was old enough to begin to\r\nreceive its education, and then mice at any time, varied occasionally with\r\na rat or two were to be found lying about the floor. As the kitten got\r\nolder, and was able to be left for longer periods alone, Poll extended her\r\nhunting excursions: one morning she brought home four or five young\r\npartridges, and the following day one of the parent birds. The next great\r\nhunt produced as many young rabbits, and although to such games I had no\r\ngreat objection to offer; yet, when frogs, toads, or lizards were the\r\nproduce of a day's sport, as was sometimes the case, I did protest.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, while the kitten was playing out of doors, it was pursued\r\nby a dog belonging to a neighbour, but escaped through a hole in a wall\r\nclose by. Poll, who at some distance had seen the whole affair, at once\r\ndarted to her kitten's side, and did her best to quiet its fears, telling\r\nit, doubtless, that she would take an early opportunity of teaching that\r\ndog better manners. The opportunity was not long wanting. Next day the dog\r\nagain passing, was noticed by puss, who ran and hid behind a corner, near\r\nwhich he would come, and there waited his approach. Just as he turned she\r\nsprung on his head, and with teeth and claws took hold so firm that he in\r\nvain endeavoured to shake her off. Going to his assistance, I with\r\nconsiderable difficulty disengaged puss, but not before his head was badly\r\ntorn.\r\n\r\nBut although thus ready to do battle when occasion required, puss knew\r\nalso how to evade a foe when so inclined.\r\n\r\nAlways treating the game-laws with that respect of which they are worthy,\r\npuss was of course never disturbed in her rambles by gamekeepers; and so\r\n'twas quite an accident when, being in the middle of a field, she was\r\nchased by a dog belonging to one. Possibly on that particular morning she\r\nmay have remembered that \"discretion is the better part of valour;\" and\r\nso, when she saw the dog coming, she made for the cliffs, by which on one\r\nside the field was bounded. But the dog was swift, and ere half the\r\ndistance was passed he was upon her. Just, however, as he was about to\r\nseize her, she sprang on one side and stopped, the dog rushing forward\r\nsome half dozen yards. While he was stopping and turning, she darted past,\r\nand thus continued to elude him till the cliffs were reached.\r\n\r\nWhile Poll and I were taking a walk one evening, a curious incident\r\noccurred. A rook flying overhead seemed struck with some peculiarity about\r\npuss; for suddenly checking himself in his flight, he circled once or\r\ntwice round us both, and apparently satisfied with the survey, darted away\r\nto the opposite side of the field, where a large flock of rooks were\r\nfeeding. He took not time to alight, but gave several peculiar caws, in a\r\ntone which seemed to me expressive of great excitement. What his\r\ncommunication was, I know not; but it seemed perfectly intelligible to the\r\nother rooks, which instantly took wing, and, following him as their\r\nleader, bore down on puss, who by this time had mounted on the top of a\r\nfence, and was quietly taking a survey of the surrounding scenery. At\r\nfirst I expected to see them attempt to carry her off bodily; but if such\r\nwas their intention, none of them had sufficient courage to begin the\r\nattack. Sometimes, indeed, one bolder than the rest would make a near\r\napproach; but, as on these occasions puss endeavoured to make a capture,\r\nthey preferred keeping at a safe distance. For fully five minutes they\r\nthus continued to circle around, filling the air with a perfect Babel of\r\nsound, and then, as suddenly departed as they had come.\r\n\r\nThis was almost the last adventure of note which we two had together.\r\nShortly after, having to remove to a distant part of the country, where I\r\ncould not take my darling with me, it became necessary either to leave her\r\nwith some acquaintance or destroy her. With increasing years, her temper,\r\nnever good towards strangers, did not improve, and being afraid that if I\r\nleft her behind me she might be subjected to bad treatment, I determined\r\nto adopt the course which seemed the lesser of two evils. On the day of my\r\ndeparture, we paid a last visit to the ocean.\r\n\r\n  \"A splash, a plunge, and all was o'er,--\r\n   The billows rolled on as they rolled before;\"\r\n\r\nand puss, my most pleasant companion and faithful friend, had met the fate\r\nfrom which I saved her so many years before. \"_Sic est vita._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n[_See Note E, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nSAGACITY OF CATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew people now-a-days think of denying, that man's noble friend the dog\r\npossesses a large amount, of what can only be termed reason. I myself\r\nbelieve, that almost every animal does; but in these pages I shall only\r\nclaim the gift for our mutual friend, the domestic cat. Reason, I\r\nconsider, is quite different from mere instinct. Instinct is born in an\r\nanimal; reason is that instinct matured by experience.\r\n\r\nI hardly think that you can find a more sagacious animal than the cat. I\r\ndoubt, indeed, if the dog is; for pussy's peculiar mode of existence, the\r\nmany enemies she has to encounter, and the struggle she often has to\r\nobtain sustenance sufficient to keep life in her poor little body, bring\r\nall her faculties into better play, and tend to the development of her\r\nreasoning powers.\r\n\r\nBefore you can fully fathom, what a wonderfully clever and wise creature\r\neven the commonest cat is, you must study her life in every phase, both\r\nout of doors and at the fireside. No relation of mere sporadic acts of\r\nsagacity, such as unfastening a door to get out, breaking a window to get\r\nin, or pulling a bell-rope to call the servant, can do justice to pussy's\r\nwisdom. Everything she does has a reason for it, and all her plans are\r\nproperly schemed and thought out beforehand, for she never fails to look\r\nbefore she leaps. Why, my reader, with all due respect to your\r\nintellectual powers, if you were to be changed into a cat for four and\r\ntwenty hours, and had a cat's routine of pleasure and duty to perform,\r\nwith all your wisdom you would be as dead as a dried haddock before\r\nsun-down. Let us try to imagine one day in a cat's life.\r\n\r\nPussy wakes in the morning as fresh as a daisy, for she has slept the\r\nsleep of the just and temperate. She finds she has been shut into the\r\nparlour; but, though it is broad day-light, the family won't be stirring\r\nyet for another hour. A long weary hour for puss, although she has the\r\npatience of Job.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" she thinks, \"if a mouse would only pop out from under the fender;\r\nsometimes one does.\" But watching won't bring it; so she jumps upon the\r\nwindow-sill, and gets behind the blind to gaze out at the bright morning,\r\nand watch the sparrows, and think of all she will do to-day. \"At any\r\nrate,\" she muses, \"I shan't be shut in here another night. So silly of me\r\nto go to sleep before the fire! And, happy thought, I'll go and see--yes,\r\nI must go and see--_him_ to-night; he'll be at the old thorn tree, I know,\r\ndear, _dear_, Tom.\"\r\n\r\nThe hour has worn away, and at last Mary comes to \"do out the room.\" \"N.B.\r\nStand by to bolt through between her ugly legs. Done--successful.\" Now\r\nupstairs to mew hungrily at her mistress's door--that ensures a cuddle;\r\nand so pussy sings while her mistress dresses. Down to breakfast at last.\r\nSoles. Oh! she doats on soles. But why does her mistress get up and leave\r\nher alone for a minute with the cream and the soles, and she so hungry\r\ntoo. What a chance to dip one paw in the cream-jug, or help herself to\r\nonly just the tail of that inviting sole! But no, she won't; and she\r\ndoesn't, though the temptation _was_ very great. Then mistress returns,\r\nand pussy is rewarded for her honesty with a delicious breakfast, and duly\r\npurrs her grace after meat.\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterward she is in her mistress's boudoir alone. Oh! St.\r\nAnthony! _Alone with the canary!_ Her eyes are drawn magnetically to the\r\ncage, her mouth opens of its own accord, her teeth water, and\r\nunconsciously she fires off a series of miniature mews, expressive of\r\nextreme desire. One little spring, and that beautiful bird would be hers.\r\nBut again she won't, she'll only just look at it; and if a cat may look at\r\na king, surely, she may at a canary. Reader, have you ever eaten a canary?\r\nA live canary, feathers and all? No! then I fear there is but little\r\nchance of your giving pussy half the credit due to her, for resisting that\r\nsore temptation and letting birdie live.\r\n\r\nBut, rats and rabbits! what has pussy done now? While canary-gazing, she\r\nhas been standing on the escritoire, and inadvertently spilled all her\r\nmistress's purple ink; and, to make matters worse, that young lady enters,\r\nin time to witness the accident and see puss making a face at the canary.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you wicked, wicked, ungrateful cat!\" Pussy flies and hides beneath\r\nthe sofa. Those cruel, unjust words, how they rankle in her breast! \"She\r\nwill never never speak to her mistress again, nor to any one in the world,\r\nnot even to Tom. She will die beneath that sofa.\" So in doleful dumps she\r\nspends two whole hours. How very irksome! If her mistress would only speak\r\nnow, she might come out, perhaps; but she only knits, knits. Suddenly,\r\ndown rolls the ball of worsted. Hurrah! out pops puss like an animated\r\narrow, and darts round and round the room after it like a mad thing. Her\r\nmistress smiles, and pussy is up on her lap in an instant, singing for joy\r\nbecause she is restored to favour.\r\n\r\nSomehow, pussy in the afternoon accidentally finds herself in Farmer\r\nHodge's pigeon-loft. She has merely come to have a look at the pretty\r\ncreatures, being fond of that sort of thing. Hark! though, a footstep on\r\nthe ladder, and enter Farmer Hodge himself. Poor pussy's intentions in the\r\npigeon-loft have been vilely misconstrued by that rude man, and she\r\nherself kicked right out of the gable-door--a fall of twenty feet at\r\nleast; however, she has the presence of mind to whirl round, and alights\r\non her feet, and thus saves her neck. It is only a quarter of a mile to\r\nrun home; so she is off, hotly pursued by the farmer and his horrid\r\ncollie. There is one tree on the way, and she gains it just in time to\r\nsave her back; and the ugly dog stops and barks up at her. A long way\r\nastern comes, puffing and blowing, the farmer himself, and when he arrives\r\nhe will stone her. One minute to get her breath; then down, flop on the\r\nback of the collie, jumps pussy. Round and round the tree she rides him\r\ntwice, then dismisses him howling. The dog runs back to his master, with a\r\nbloody nose and one eye seriously damaged, while pussy, scot free,\r\nregains the shelter of her home, just in time for dinner. \"Now, my little\r\nlady,\" says pussy's mistress, about bed-time, \"I see you are watching to\r\nget out, and indeed you mustn't; so come with me.\" A little deceit is\r\nabsolutely necessary now, if pussy wants to gain her ends. After all, it\r\nis only policy; so pussy purring complacently accompanies her mistress to\r\nher bed-room. But having duly sung the young lady asleep, she quietly\r\nsteals from her side and creeps to the window. Luckily, it is open.\r\nFifteen feet is a tallish jump though; but she remembers that when Farmer\r\nHodge gave her a hint to leave the pigeon-loft, she leaped twenty feet.\r\nShe feels that hint on her rump even now; but here goes. She has done it,\r\nand is safe. Then what a delicious sense of freedom and prospective bliss!\r\nAnd, hark! yonder is Tom's melodious voice in the distance, and pussy is\r\noff in the moonlight to meet him, and she \"won't go home till morning.\"\r\n\r\nCats are very sensitive to kindness, and are never ungrateful for benefits\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nA certain labouring woman got a cat, to which she became greatly\r\nattached. When the time came round, for her absence for six weeks at\r\nharvest, in a distant part of the country, she took her cat, and the one\r\nkitten it was giving suck to, and gave it in charge of a brother who lived\r\nthree miles from her own village. But here poor pussy wasn't happy. The\r\nchildren beat and otherwise annoyed her; so she returned to her own home\r\nin the village, leaving the kitten behind her. Finding the house shut up,\r\nshe sought shelter in a kindly neighbour's house; and having established\r\nherself in her new home, she set out for the house where she had left the\r\nkitten. She did not attempt to remove it, however, but simply gave it suck\r\nand left again. Twice a day regularly, for three weeks, did this queer\r\npussy trot those six long miles to suckle her kitten, until one day she\r\nfound it drinking milk from a saucer. After this she never went back. On\r\nher mistress's return from harvest, pussy again became her faithful\r\ncompanion; clearly showing that although she was grateful to the\r\nneighbour, she knew she did not belong to her. But every year pussy\r\nstayed all the harvest with her benefactress until the return of her\r\nmistress; and this habit she kept up all her life, fourteen years.\r\n\r\nHow do cats know certain days of the week, such as Saturday or Monday?\r\n\r\nA shopkeeper, whom I knew, had a nice Tom tabby, which he kept night and\r\nday in his shop, to protect his wares from mice and rats. On Saturdays,\r\nTom was allowed to accompany his master home, a distance of nearly a mile,\r\nand to remain at home until the following Monday. Pussy got used to this;\r\nand as the shop was always kept open until ten o'clock on Saturdays, Tom\r\nused regularly to leave the place and go home fully three hours before his\r\nmaster. On the Monday morning, he was always quite ready to accompany him\r\nback again. When this cat grew a few years older, he began to tire of\r\nnight duties. He, no doubt, thought he had done enough when he had been on\r\nguard all day. So to get off the night shift, he used to leave the shop\r\nwhen his master made signs of putting up the shutters. He would wait at a\r\nconvenient distance till his master came; but finding that he was\r\ninvariably captured and carried back, he fell upon another plan: he took\r\nto leaving the shop an hour before closing time. His master used to meet\r\nhim half-ways home, but never could put a finger on him.\r\n\r\nThis same cat had been rescued from an ugly death, when quite a kitten, by\r\na son of his master. Tom was greatly attached to this boy. When the boy\r\ngrew to be a man, and only visited the house once a year, Tom still knew\r\nhim, and manifested great delight in seeing him.\r\n\r\nCats, however, do not show the joy they feel on meeting again with a long\r\nlost friend in so exuberant a manner as the dog.\r\n\r\nOn first seeing you they exhibit surprise, then quietly show how glad they\r\nare by rubbing round you, singing, and following wherever you go, as if\r\nafraid of being again separated. A dog is a more excitable animal, and\r\nmore demonstrative in every way than the thoughtful pussy.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how cats can open doors by jumping up and pressing down\r\nthe latch; this trick is more common in tortoise-shell cats than in any\r\nothers, and often descends from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nA lady's favourite cat the other day saved the life of her pet canary. The\r\ndoor of the bird's cage having been by some accident left open, Dickie\r\nflew out, and at once made for the outside door, which happened to be\r\nopen. The cat, however, immediately gave chase, and captured the bird in\r\nthe lobby. Tom at once returned, and placed the poor bird--half dead with\r\nfright--at his mistress's feet.\r\n\r\nI know of a cat--not at all a moral specimen--that took a fancy to eat one\r\nof her master's rabbits. Knowing that she could not well do this within\r\nsight of the dwelling-house, she managed to chase one, or rather walk one,\r\nfor she was too wise to hurry it, nearly a quarter of a mile from the\r\nhouse. She was just beginning her feast when discovered.\r\n\r\nA cat that dwelt in an outhouse, was seen one day to deliberately take a\r\nportion of her dinner, and place it in front of a mouse-hole in a corner.\r\nShe then retired to a distance, and set herself to watch. Not many\r\nminutes after, a fine plump mouse came out, gave one look round, and\r\nseeing nothing suspicious, commenced to eat the crumbs; while doing so,\r\npussy sprang upon and captured it easily.\r\n\r\nIt is a common custom in the north of Scotland, and I suppose is so in\r\nother places, for the household cat regularly to attend at the milking of\r\nthe cows, and to receive her allowance squirted directly from the cow's\r\npap. No matter to what distance it is sent, pussy will adroitly stem the\r\ncurrent with open mouth, and eyes closed with delight.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine once saw a cat, attempting to suck a quiet good-natured\r\ncow. She failed, however; but walked directly up to where the gentleman\r\nwas standing, and mewing in his face ran back and sat down below the\r\nudder, plainly requesting the favour of his assistance. He good-naturedly\r\ncomplied, and every day for weeks afterwards, the cat used to come for him\r\nto perform the same kind office.\r\n\r\nThere is an old old man lives in K----, who has an old old cat. He is over\r\none hundred years, and the cat is gone nineteen; in that long time they\r\nhave come to know each other pretty well. One evening, some years ago,\r\npussy was sitting in a particularly studious attitude before the fire, as\r\nif it had something important to tell and didn't know how to begin. The\r\nold man was looking at her thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"That cat,\" he said presently, \"has something on her mind; haven't you,\r\npuss?\"\r\n\r\nPussy, to his grandchild's no small astonishment, at once mewed in reply;\r\nand jumping up, patted the old man's leg, and commenced trotting to the\r\nfoot of the stair, looking over her shoulder and asking him to follow.\r\n\r\n\"Go you, Lizzie,\" said the old man; and Lizzie went, following the cat up\r\nthe stairs and into an old lumber garret. There the cause of pussy's\r\nanxiety was soon discovered: a litter of five fine kittens, which pussy\r\nhad had without the knowledge of any one in the house.\r\n\r\nCats are as fond of bird-nesting as any school-boy. A cat last summer\r\nfound a starling's nest in the gable-end of an old barn. There were\r\nfive eggs in it at the time, but these pussy did not touch, she preferred\r\nwaiting until they were hatched. She was seen to go, sometimes as often as\r\nthree times a day, and have a peep into the nest. When at length she was\r\nrewarded for her patience with the sight of goslings, she coolly put in\r\nher paw, drew out the little things one by one and devoured them before\r\ntheir distracted parents' eyes. I did not feel at all sorry for that\r\nbereaved mother starling, for she and her impudent husband had rummaged\r\nevery sparrow's nest about the place, and eaten the eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TORTOISESHELL and WHITE.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by J. HURRY, ESQ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TABBY and WHITE.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by J. GAMBLE, ESQ.]\r\n\r\nA man of the name of Claughie, shepherd to a nobleman in the West of\r\nIreland had an enormously large Tom cat, who, as far as milk was\r\nconcerned, was a notorious thief--the result, no doubt, of a deficient\r\neducation in his youth. However, Tom was in the habit of committing\r\ndepredations in the milk-house almost every night. Being always forgiven\r\nby the shepherd's wife, he became at last quite a nuisance, and the\r\nshepherd determined to give him one sound hiding. He caught Tom in the\r\nvery act of stealing cream, and he warmed him accordingly. Tom went out in\r\nhigh dudgeon, and no more was thought of it. But that night Tom returned,\r\nand with him a number of other cats. Having surrounded the hut, they\r\nproceeded in true Fenian style, to break the windows and force an\r\nentrance. The shepherd, afraid of his life, fled to a loft, drawing up the\r\nladder after him. His wife, however, showed more courage. She at once\r\nproduced two large pansful of cream, and invited the intruders to drink.\r\nThey did not require a second bidding, and having regaled themselves, they\r\ndeparted in peace and came no more.\r\n\r\nBut cats will often leave a house and never return, if they have been\r\nthreatened with a severe licking.\r\n\r\nA man residing in Ireland had a nice cat, which was fully eleven years of\r\nage, and which he had reared from kittenhood. One day this cat received\r\ncorrection for some offence, and that same night it disappeared. It not\r\nonly disappeared itself, but enticed a neighbour's cat along with it.\r\nNeither of them ever returned. The two cats had always lived on terms of\r\ngreat intimacy with each other.\r\n\r\nAnother cat had succumbed to temptation and stolen some fish; she was so\r\nafraid of getting whipped for the theft, that she did not enter the house\r\nfor two whole days. At the end of that time she was coming quietly in,\r\nwhen the goodwife, half in fun, seized hold of the poker, and shaking it\r\nat the poor delinquent, \"Go out, you thieving hussy,\" she cried, \"and\r\nnever darken my door again.\" The cat drew back, and slipped away, and was\r\nnever seen more in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOf the eggs of fowls some cats are exceedingly fond, and if they once\r\nacquire a taste for this particular luxury, nothing can ever break them\r\nfrom it, and they will always find ways and means of indulging in the\r\npropensity. A cat of my acquaintance used to content herself with two, or\r\nat most, three a day. She belonged to a grocer, and was quite honest with\r\nregard to everything else. It was the shopkeeper himself who was to blame\r\nfor this fault in poor pussy: for in unpacking his eggs he would\r\noccasionally drop one, then call pussy's attention to the fact, saying,\r\n\"Here, pussy, you take that.\" So in process of time the cat took rather a\r\npenchant for eggs. She would jump on the counter whenever the whim struck\r\nher, and take an egg from the basket; then, with a face beaming with\r\nmischief, she would proceed to make a mouse of it, paw-pawing it until it\r\nrolled over on to the floor, as if by the merest accident in the world.\r\nThen it was amusing to see the air of astonishment pussy adopted, as she\r\npeered wonderingly over the edge of the counter, as much as to\r\nsay,--\"Hullo! broken? Here, pussy, you take that.\" And down she would jump\r\nand lick it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n[_See Note F, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nA CAT THAT KEEPS THE SABBATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, far-seeing reader, you are right, it is a Scotch cat. In England a\r\ndeficient educational scheme is dead against the chance of any such\r\nanomaly. In some parts of bonnie Scotland you \"daurna whistle on the\r\nSabbath,\" the dogs \"daurna\" bark, the cows \"daurna\" low, and the cock is\r\nconfined beneath a barrel, to prevent him giving expression to his\r\nindependence. England is looked upon as a poor benighted country, living\r\nin darkness and ignorance; and a tourist is termed a \"poor daft\r\nEnglisher,\" or a \"gangrel body.\" But now for the cat.\r\n\r\nThis pussy completes a family circle, who dwell in a remote village of\r\nForfarshire. It is the only live stock they possess, is an old\r\nold-fashioned cat, and of course a great pet. It has a daily round of\r\nduties, from which it never varies any more than the clock does. It sleeps\r\nwith the children, and gets up at the same hour every morning. It first\r\nstrolls round all the rooms, watching for a little every mouse-hole, where\r\nit has ever killed a mouse. It then goes to its mistress's bedroom, wakes\r\nher and sees her dressed, trots before her to the door and is let out,\r\ncoming in at the same hour every day for breakfast, and showing signs of\r\nindignation if its porridge and milk are not ready waiting, or if they are\r\ntoo hot, which it ascertains by a preliminary touch with its toe.\r\nBreakfast over, comes a long hour's sleep before the parlour fire in\r\nwinter, or in the sun in summer-time. Then comes the time for the forenoon\r\nconstitutional--a mere walk for pastime; true, if a sparrow pops down\r\nbefore its nose, it is nimbly caught and eaten; but at this early hour\r\npussy prefers lighter amusements,--catching butterflies, turtle-turning\r\nfrogs, climbing trees, or dancing ghillie-callum on the back of the\r\nshepherd's unhappy collie-dog. She is always at home a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore her master, with whom she dines. Reinvigorated by the mid-day meal,\r\npussy now starts on a hunting expedition, the scene of action being a\r\nwood about a quarter of a mile from her residence. Here this cat stays\r\nbird-catching among the trees, until the sun sets and there isn't a bird\r\nto be seen, and then comes trotting home. A drink of sweet milk forms a\r\nlight but nutritious supper, and not a bad narcotic; then this methodical\r\npuss curls herself up at the \"bairnies'\" feet, and sings herself and them\r\nto sleep. Such is pussy's week-day work, never varying, day by day and\r\nyear by year. But on Sunday _she does no work_, and neither fights nor\r\nhunts, but keeps the house, dumb and demure, like the pious little puss\r\nshe is; musing with half-shut eyes over the fire, or basking in the\r\nsunshine on the garden walk.\r\n\r\nWhat an example to the wild strath-vagrant, Sabbath-breaking cats of other\r\nplaces! Early to bed and early to rise, who can doubt this pussy's wisdom?\r\nWho can doubt that in her rural home--\r\n\r\n      \"She'll crown, in shades like these,\r\n  A youth of labour with an age of ease.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n[_See Note G, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nHONEST CATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous instances of the honesty of well-trained cats might be given. My\r\nown cat and travelling companion Muffie, has always taken her place on the\r\ntable at meals, and I have never had reason to repent of the indulgence.\r\nEven should I leave the room for half an hour, nothing could tempt her to\r\nlay a paw upon anything; neither will she allow any one else, not even the\r\nwaiter, to touch the viands without my permission. If I go to sleep on the\r\nsofa, she immediately mounts guard over me, and it would be very\r\nincautious in any one to come within reach of her nails. All sorts of\r\nproperty she guards just the same, and of my starling she is particularly\r\ncareful.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of my acquaintance used to have a cat, which brought home wild\r\nrabbits almost daily, but he knew his master's tame ones, and many a romp\r\nand rough-and-tumble they had together on the lawn. Tom's master had a\r\nmavis. This bird did not live in a cage, but roamed about the house at its\r\nown sweet will; yet pussy never made any attempt to injure it; in fact,\r\nseemed to like it. What was most singular, the cat was in the constant\r\nhabit of bringing in live birds,--sparrows, larks, and sometimes even a\r\nmavis, which she quietly devoured beside Dickie, he standing on the floor\r\nin front of her, looking on and whistling to himself. Birds being the\r\nnatural prey of the cat, the foregoing anecdote just shows to what a high\r\nstate of training they can be brought, and how well worthy pussy is of\r\nbeing trained. There is as much too in the breeding, as in the educating;\r\nfor you always find that honest cats have honest kittens, and _vice\r\nversâ_. Of course it is contrary to nature to expect a cat to live on\r\nterms of intimacy with a bird and not sometimes make a mistake.\r\n\r\nAn old toll-keeper, in Stirlingshire, had a favourite cat and a pet canary\r\nat the same time. Living all alone, and having plenty of spare time, he\r\nhad the pussy taught to allow the bird to take any liberties with her he\r\nchose, and to perch on her back or head whenever he had a mind. Indeed,\r\nDickie was seldom in his cage, when he could be with the cat. Many people\r\ncame to see them; and to remove all scepticism the toll-man used to open\r\nthe cage-door, when the bird would immediately fly out, alight on pussy's\r\nhead, and at once burst into song. One day, when working in his garden, a\r\ncat passed Mr. Tolly, apparently in a vehement hurry, with a bright yellow\r\nbird in its mouth, and hurried away towards the wood. \"Losh!\" said Tolly,\r\nsticking his spade in the ground and scratching his poll, \"that can never\r\nbe _my_ cat sure_ly_!\" and \"Lord, have a care o' me!\" he added; \"that can\r\nnever surely be _my_ bird.\" With a beating heart he rushed towards the\r\nhouse, and there got proof positive it was both his cat and his bird; for\r\nthe cage-door was open, and puss and Dick had both disappeared. It was a\r\ncase of elopement, or rather abduction of the most forcible nature. Poor\r\nTolly was now a very lonely man indeed; for, well aware of the heinous\r\nnature of the crime she had committed, and afraid of the consequences, the\r\ncat never returned.\r\n\r\n\"In our city house,\" writes a lady to me, \"we have a fine grey and black\r\ncat. This cat is the most honest of creatures, and guards our larder from\r\nthe predatory inroads of the neighbour's cats. On one occasion a stray cat\r\nwas observed to run away with a cold stewed pigeon. Our cat rushed after\r\nthe thief, and with some difficulty induced it to drop the spoil; she then\r\nbrought the pigeon back and laid it down at its master's feet.\"\r\n\r\nIt is by no means an uncommon thing in Scotland, to see a large tabby on a\r\nshopkeeper's counter, kept to look after bigger thieves than rats or mice.\r\nSome of these animals I have known to especially hate little boys, and\r\nindeed to raise serious objections to their being served at all. I\r\nremember one cat in particular, a very large and powerful Tom, who used\r\ndaily to mount guard on the counter, to protect his master's wares. He\r\nused to walk up and down, generally keeping close to the shopkeeper, and\r\nhis quick eye on the customer. If the latter paid the money down, he was\r\nallowed to take up and pocket the articles; but if he put a finger on any\r\nlittle package before paying, Tom's big paw was down on him at once, a\r\nhint that never required repeating to the same customer. It is almost\r\nneedless to say that Tom himself was the pink of everything that was fair\r\nand honest; he was never, under any circumstances, known to steal. One\r\nday, the merchant had gone for a few minutes into the back shop, leaving\r\nTom sitting, apparently asleep, beside a large piece of butter, which had\r\njust been weighed. An urchin, who happened to be passing, seeing the state\r\nof affairs--the coast clear and the sentry asleep--determined not to let\r\nslip so golden an opportunity; he had a large piece of oat-cake in his\r\nhand. He would butter that at least, he thought. He had just got the knife\r\nstuck into the butter, when, quick as lightning, Tom nabbed him. Deeply\r\nin, through the skin, went the cat's claws, and loudly screamed the\r\nurchin. Tom raised his voice in concert, but held fast, and the duet\r\nquickly brought the shopkeeper to the spot. Tom appeared to have great\r\nsatisfaction in seeing that little Arab's ears boxed.\r\n\r\nI know an instance of a cat, which brought home a live canary in its\r\nmouth, which she presented to her mistress. The bird was put in a cage,\r\nand turned out a great pet; and pussy and the bird were always great\r\nfriends; the cat one day punishing severely a stray puss that had been\r\nguilty of the unpardonable crime of looking at the canary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n[_See Note H, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nTHE PLOUGHMAN'S \"MYSIE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTen miles along dusty roads in a hilly country, and on a hot summer's day,\r\nwas rather fatiguing, and I was glad to find the ploughman's cottage, or\r\nrather hut, at last. It was placed in a picturesque little nook, at the\r\nfoot of the Ochil mountains, and consisted simply of a \"butt and a ben,\"\r\nwith a potatoe patch and kail-yard in front. The mistress was at home; her\r\ngoodman, she said, was busy sowing turnips. But she kindly asked me in,\r\nand showed me into the best room, with its mahogany chest of drawers,\r\nold-fashioned eight-day clock, and bed with snowy counterpane in the\r\ncorner. While I rested, the good woman produced her kebbuck of last year's\r\ncheese, a basin of creamy milk, and some delicious oat-cakes,--a banquet\r\nfor a hungry king,--and bade me eat, apologising that she had no whisky in\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" she said, \"you've come a' this lang road too see our Mysie.\r\nWell,\" pointing towards the bed, \"yonder she is, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI was certainly a little disappointed. Mysie was a tortoise-shell and\r\nwhite, pretty well marked, but small and with an expression, as I thought,\r\nof bad temper about her little face, which just then seemed the reverse of\r\npleasant; but this wore off when I patted and caressed her.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything remarkable about her?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Weel, sir,\" said her mistress, \"she can catch mice like winking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cats generally do,\" said I laughing; \"anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's a queer cratur. She has never slept a single night in the house\r\nsince her e'en were opened, and----But you're no eating, sir.\"\r\n\r\nI praised the cakes and kebbuck, and remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, sir,\" she said at last, \"_she saved my husband's life_ last\r\nfa' o' the year. For George is a proud proud man, and would never accept\r\nmeal or maut that he hadna worked or paid for.[1] But he had been lang\r\nlang ill; and ae day when I followed the doctor to the door, he told me\r\nthat my poor man must die if he didna have his strength kept up. 'Flesh\r\nand wine,' said the doctor, 'flesh and wine and plenty of both.' Ah!\r\nlittle he kenned. So I put awa (pledged) my marriage gown and ring to get\r\nhim wine; but we had naething in the house but milk and meal. Surely, sir,\r\nit was the Lord Himself that put it into that cat's head; for, that same\r\nnight, she brought in a fine young rabbit, and laid it on the verra\r\nbed;\"--the good woman was weeping now--\"and the next night the same, and\r\nevery night the same, for a month, whiles a rabbit and whiles a bird, till\r\nGeorge was up and going to his work as usual. But she _never brought\r\nonything hame after that_. She's, maybe, no bonnie, sir; but, God bless\r\nher, she is unco good and wiser than many a human.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time I could perceive no expression on Mysie's face but that of\r\nunalterable fidelity and unchangeable love.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't like to part with her, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Part wi' Mysie, sir? No for a' the warld's wealth.\"\r\n\r\nSo I bade them good-bye, not now regretting my long walk to the Ochil\r\nmountains, and the ploughman's faithful Mysie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n[_See Note I, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nTENACITY OF LIFE IN CATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As many lives as a cat,\" and \"a cat has nine lives,\" are sayings which we\r\nhear almost every day. The truth of the latter we must all acknowledge;\r\nnot indeed as regards the imputed plurality of lives in the cat, but, as\r\nillustrative of the extreme tenacity of the one life she possesses. As an\r\nIrishman would say, pussy may be many times \"kill't,\" but only once\r\n\"kill't entirely;\" or, as a Zanzibar nigger would have it, she may be\r\noften-times dead, but only once \"gone dead.\"\r\n\r\nJoy was a farmer's cat, a beautifully-marked lady-tabby. She was extremely\r\nfond of horses, used to jump on their backs, and often sleep there at\r\nnight. She was consequently nearly always in the stable. One day, however,\r\none of her pets kicked her,--accidentally it is to be hoped, but so\r\nseverely that one of the men found her, lying cold and stiff beside the\r\nwall. He lifted her up and laid her on the dunghill, until he should find\r\ntime to give her a decent burial. Here the poor animal lay all day in the\r\nsun, and here she was found at milking-time, by a kind-hearted servant\r\ngirl. Thinking she perceived some tokens of life about it, and remembering\r\nthe proverb, she took the pussy into the kitchen, and rolling it carefully\r\nin a flannel petticoat, placed it in front of the fire. When she came in\r\nfrom milking, she was rejoiced to find that pussy was so much better, as\r\nto be able to lift her head and taste a little warm milk. With three days'\r\ncareful nursing the cat recovered. She lived to a goodly old age, but\r\nabjured the turf,--she never backed a favourite again.\r\n\r\nAnother cat, found in a trap, was cruelly beaten about the head by a\r\nbrutal keeper, until the blood gushed from both ears. He finally cut off\r\nthe poor thing's tail as a trophy of his bravery, and left her on the\r\nground for dead. Her mistress, hearing of what had happened, was soon on\r\nthe spot, and carried home what she thought was the dead body of her cat.\r\nShe tried every means of resuscitation, nevertheless, and in three weeks\r\nhad the satisfaction of seeing pussy as well as ever, and as full of fun;\r\nonly it was now a Manx cat, an artificial one. Pussy must often have seen\r\nher own tail hanging on the game-keeper's wall, in company with a dead\r\nhawk, an owl, and a few hoody-crows. The man had the tail frizzed up to\r\nmake it look big; and pointing it out to many a cockney sportsman, used to\r\nrelate a story of a dreadful encounter he had with a \"real wild cat, sir,\"\r\nwhich he at last slew; \"and yonder,\" he would always add, \"hangs the\r\nbuffer's tail.\"\r\n\r\nA man going one morning into his dovecot, which in this case was an attic\r\nat the top of a house eight-storeys high, found his own cat killing the\r\npigeons right and left. Greatly enraged, he kicked the animal through the\r\nopen window. On going down shortly after, rather ashamed and sorry for\r\nwhat he had done, he was greatly surprised to see pussy gather herself up,\r\nand slink in at the back door. Apparently she was none the worse of her\r\nrather hurried descent from a height of over fifty feet.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the cat which the keeper \"kill'd,\" there was no doubt\r\nfracture of the skull. In the following case, the apparent death was no\r\ndoubt due to severe concussion of the brain, or stunning.\r\n\r\nA boy in going to school one day, saw a large cat sitting not far from its\r\nmaster's door. Without meaning to hurt the pussy, but with that\r\nrecklessness of consequences which characterizes most school-boys, he\r\npicked up a stone to have \"just one shy at her.\" He struck her on the\r\nhead, and pussy dropped to all appearance as dead as the stone itself.\r\nAfraid of the consequences of detection, he picked the cat up and threw it\r\nin a cornfield not far off. As murderers are said to haunt the scene of\r\ntheir guilt, so the boy every morning, for the three following days, found\r\nhimself irresistibly drawn towards the field of corn, and every morning\r\nthere lay his victim stark and still. On the fourth morning, however, she\r\nwas gone; and in returning from school the same evening, the boy's\r\nastonishment was very great indeed, on seeing the identical cat, washing\r\nits face at its master's door, as if nothing had ever occurred to annoy\r\nit.\r\n\r\nKittens, too, possess the same tenacity of life which is so remarkable in\r\nthe full-grown cat.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, for example, had a cat which gave birth to a litter of\r\nfive kittens, four of which were ordered to be drowned. The execution of\r\nthe sentence was duly carried out, the same evening in a pail of water.\r\nWhen full time had been given to the kits to give their final kick, the\r\npail was emptied on a heap of manure. Next morning, however, all the young\r\npussies were found alive and well in their happy mother's arms. She was\r\nallowed to rear them. I do not know what means pussy adopted to revivify\r\nher apparently drowned offspring, or I should at once send the recipe to\r\nthe Royal Humane Society, and patiently wait for a silver medallion by\r\nreturn of post.\r\n\r\nI remember, when a boy, seeing a horrid old woman dig a hole in the earth\r\nand deliberately bury three kittens alive. The ground heaved above them,\r\nand she clapped the earth with the spade till all motion ceased. The same\r\naged wretch used to toast snails in a little flannel bag before the fire,\r\nin order to extract the oil for sprains, and I have often shuddered to\r\nhear the snails squeak; but this of course has nothing to do with the\r\nsubject of cats. I went and told my little sister of the cruel interment;\r\nand, watching our chance--we really thought the old woman would bury us if\r\nshe caught us--we dug up the kittens fully an hour after, and were\r\nsuccessful in nursing two of them back to life. We reared them on the\r\nspoon.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote might, perhaps, have been more properly related, in\r\nthe chapter on cruelty to cats; however, as illustrative of the subject in\r\npoint, we give it here. At a certain farm-town, about ten years ago, one\r\nof the men-servants conceived a great antipathy to his master's cat. The\r\ncat had been guilty of some little delinquency in the bothy, or\r\nfarm-servants' hall, for which the man had punished pussy. The farmer had\r\ntaken his cat's part, and scolded the man, and hence the _casus belli_.\r\nThe man swore vengeance on poor pussy, whenever an opportunity should\r\noccur. Nor had he long to wait; a fast-day came round, and nearly every\r\none had gone to church. The brutal fellow got the cat in the stable, and\r\ncommenced putting her to death with a horsewhip. This he had well-nigh\r\naccomplished, when puss by some means effected her escape. She was unable,\r\nhowever, to make much use of her legs, so he whipped her round and round\r\nthe farm-steading, until the poor creature took refuge in a hole, which\r\nhappened to be in the barn wall. This hole was a _cul-de-sac_, having no\r\nopening on the inside of the wall. It now occurred to this fiendish lout,\r\nthat he might easily accomplish pussy's death and burial at the same time,\r\nand he forthwith proceeded to build up the hole with stone and lime. The\r\ncat was missed, and a whole week elapsed without any tidings of her; and\r\nalthough suspicion fell upon the right party, there was no proof. A whole\r\nweek elapsed, when one evening the farmer was standing near the barn\r\nwondering if ever he would see his little friend again. Suddenly his eye\r\nfell upon the servant's handiwork. That wall, he thought, was never\r\nrepaired by my orders; my poor cat is buried there. To fetch a pick and\r\ntear out the stones did not take many seconds, and then from her very\r\ngrave he pulled the pussy. Strange to say, she was alive; and though\r\ndreadfully emaciated, by careful nursing she got all right again in a few\r\nweeks. She had been eight days immured in a cramped position. Only fancy\r\nher sufferings.\r\n\r\nSome schoolboys, not long since, stoned a poor cat till she fell down\r\napparently dead. Afraid of what they had done, they determined to kill it\r\noutright, and bury it in an adjoining field. This they endeavoured to do\r\nby dashing the cat's head against a stone fence; not succeeding, however,\r\nand being in a hurry to get off, to escape detection a grave was hurriedly\r\ndug, and pussy interred. The ground was still moving over her when the\r\nyoung wretches left. Bad news travels apace; and the owner of poor puss\r\nhearing of her favourite's death and burial, hastened to the grave and dug\r\nher up. There was still life in her, and by careful treatment she made a\r\ngood recovery, and was seen about her old haunts four or five days after.\r\n\r\nThe following case of suspended animation may seem almost incredible; it\r\nis authentic nevertheless, and not unaccountable either on scientific\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe owner of a black and white cat determined, for private reasons, to get\r\nrid of her. He had not the heart to hang her, or he was not sufficiently\r\nenamoured of Calcraft's profession to do so; there was no poison in the\r\nhouse; and as he lived away up in the centre of a hilly country, there was\r\nno water, without walking a long distance, sufficiently deep to drown her.\r\nThinking, however, that suffocation, in whatever way produced, was as easy\r\na death as any, he got a small bag, in which he placed the cat, tying the\r\nmouth of the sack. He then dug a hole in the garden and lowered her down.\r\n\r\n\"I'll no hurt ye, poor puss,\" he said, as he pressed the earth firmly but\r\ngently over her; \"and ye'll no be lang o' deeing there--God! she canna\r\nlive wantin' breath.\" This grave was merely meant for a temporary\r\nresting-place; so next morning the man went to open it, with the intention\r\nof placing her remains at the foot of a tree. To his surprise pussy jumped\r\nout of the bag \"alive and well;\" well enough, at any rate, to make her\r\nfeet her friends. That cat thought she had lived long enough, in that part\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThe same black Tom mentioned in a former chapter, as guarding his master's\r\nwares, and keeping his eye on questionable customers, was certainly very\r\nexemplary in his honesty; but as every pussy has one little failing so had\r\nbig Tom. An egg was Tom's stumbling-block. He could have got dozens of\r\nthem on his master's counter, but that would have been theft; besides, he\r\npreferred his eggs new-laid, and not imported. So, with the intention of\r\nministering to his cravings, Tom used to pay occasional visits to the\r\nhenneries of the neighbours. He also had a habit of making a pilgrimage\r\nto an adjoining village, and calling at the house of a man called Archie,\r\na weaver and customer of his master's. Archie was very fond of Tom, and\r\nalways made him welcome. Not so, however, a man called Dan, who lived in\r\nthe next house. For this man openly accused Tom of stealing his eggs; and\r\nthere was no doubt some truth in it, for Dan's wife swore she had seen Tom\r\nmore than once, coming out through the hen-hole in the barn door, with his\r\nbeard still yellow with the yolk of a stolen egg. Dan resolved to be\r\nrevenged, and at once set about encompassing the poor pussy's death. He so\r\narranged a bag beneath the hen-hole, that on Tom's going through he would\r\nbe certain to pop into it, and so make himself prisoner. The first time\r\nthe bag was set Dan only captured his own cock, the next time a stray hen\r\nof a neighbour; but this only made him the more determined; and eventually\r\nhe was successful. Tom was a prisoner, and condemned to instant execution\r\nby Dan and his wife Bell. Bell indeed was even more bitter against the cat\r\nthan her husband. Just then pussy's friend the weaver happened to come\r\nupon the scene, and hearing what had occurred, and what was about to\r\nfollow, he pleaded long and hard for his little friend's life, and even\r\nthreatened the terrors of the law; but Dan was inexorable. Die Tom should,\r\nhe said, if he himself should hang for it. He \"kill'd\" the cat by dashing\r\nthe sack, many times against the gable-wall of his own house. \"He's quiet\r\nenough now,\" said Dan.\r\n\r\n\"Make siccar,\" said Bell; and she commenced hitting Tom with the spade she\r\nhad brought to dig his grave.\r\n\r\n\"You ugly black brute,\" she cried; \"you'll steal nae mair eggs in this\r\nwarld.\"\r\n\r\nDan then threw the sack over his shoulders, and accompanied by his wife as\r\ngrave-digger, and Archie the weaver as chief mourner, they proceeded to\r\nthe garden to bury the unfortunate Tom. A grave was dug at the foot of a\r\ngooseberry bush, and Dan opening the mouth of the sack, proceeded to\r\nshake out the mangled remains of the cat. You may judge of the chagrin and\r\ndisgust of Dan and his cruel Bell, when those same mangled remains no\r\nsooner touched the ground, than they got together again somehow, and\r\nspringing out of the grave, made their way like greased lightning out of\r\nthe garden and off. The tables were turned. Dan was chief mourner now.\r\n\r\n\"Curse the cat!\" he roared.\r\n\r\nDan's wife was equal to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"You're a fool, gudeman,\" she said,--and indeed, he did not look much\r\nunlike one,--\"the cat's the deevil, and you can fill in the grave\r\nyersel'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n[_See Note J, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nNOMADISM IN CATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few, if any cats, that can withstand the temptation to\r\noccasionally roam abroad, and lead for a while the life of a gipsy puss.\r\nPerhaps pussy thinks she has as much right to her holiday, as master or\r\nmistress. Home life must at times grow monotonous and irksome, and a\r\nchange no doubt highly desirable. Besides, cats are of a more social\r\ndisposition among their species than dogs are. They like to meet and\r\nexchange ideas with their fellow cats. Night is the season almost\r\ninvariably chosen for these social _réunions_. There is then more\r\nseclusion, and less likelihood of their being disturbed. They know that\r\ndogs stick closely at home after dark, and that little boys are sound\r\nasleep. By night, moreover, the voices of the gentlemen who give addresses\r\nare more easily heard. Everything else being so still, each inflection and\r\nintonation of voice is beautifully distinct. It matters not that the\r\nnervous lady in No. 5. is kept awake till the close of the meeting, and\r\ncan't sleep a wink after that; that No. 3. can't get her baby to sleep; or\r\nthat No. 2. is writing a letter to the _Times_, and can't follow out any\r\nsingle idea;--the concert in the back-garden of No. 4. goes on all the\r\nsame. How sweetly that old tabby cat imitates the harmonies of a bass\r\nviolin! How grandly that black Tom's voice rises and swells, floats and\r\nsoars, on the night breeze! How beautifully those five cats in the corner,\r\nare imitating the dulcet strains of the great highland bag-pipe! Three of\r\nthem are told of as drones, the other two do the lilting, and the effect\r\nis quite startling. So at least thinks that old bachelor wretch in the\r\ntwo-pair back, who now throws open the window, and rains curses and cold\r\nwater on the influential meeting, momentarily interrupting the flow of\r\nharmony. Only momentarily however.\r\n\r\n\"Move on a garden or two,\" suggests black Tom; \"that old beast has no\r\nsoul.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRIPED, or BROWN TABBY.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by MISS M. E. MOORE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED TABBY.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by MISS FORSHALL.]\r\n\r\nAnd the concert goes on as before.\r\n\r\nCats are republicans of the rubiest red. Communism is rampant in their\r\nranks; and indeed, they seem to thrive on it. In our day, we hope\r\ncommunism will always be confined to the cats. There is no respect of\r\npersons shown among cats. One cat is as good as another; and the sharpest\r\nclaw and the strongest arm rules supreme for the time. Beauty, rank, and\r\nbreeding are alike despised. At pussy's balls and assemblies, there is no\r\nsuch officer as master of ceremonies. Any gentleman may introduce himself\r\nto any lady, he chooses, provided always she does not spit in his face,\r\nand box his ears; for, in this way, the lady never hesitates to express\r\ndisapprobation of her partner. In so outspoken a community, boredom is\r\nthus practically done away with, and there is a freedom from all\r\naffectation which is highly refreshing. There you may see my Lord\r\nTom-noddy, whose noble form rests by day on a tiger-skin mat by a sea-coal\r\nfire, whispering, nay, rather howling, soft nothings in the ears of Miss\r\nPussy Black-leg, whose mistress keeps a marine store, at Wapping\r\nOld-stairs, and sits up nightly to \"wait for Jack.\" Yet no one can doubt\r\nthe genuineness of his lordship's proposals, who marks his earnest manner,\r\nor listens to the impassioned tones of his voice as he beseeches her to\r\n\r\n  Fly, fil-ly with him now, ne-ow-w.\r\n\r\nThe young and beautiful Lady Lovelace, with fur so long and white, and\r\nsofter than eider-down, with eyes of himmel-blue, who sleeps all day on a\r\ncushion of scarlet, and sips her creamy milk from a china saucer, is\r\nyonder in a corner, flirting with the coal-heaver's Bob. Bob's ears are\r\nrent in ribbons, his face is seamed with bloody scars, he is lame, his fur\r\nnearly all singed off, and he has only one eye and half a tail; but his\r\nvoice, that is what has won the heart of the young beauty; and when the\r\nball is over he will convey her home in the moonlight to her splendid\r\nmansion in Belgravia--he himself will be content with an hour's nod in the\r\ncoal cellar. The pretty pussy's mistress is anxiously waiting for her\r\ndarling, and will not sleep till she comes. But witness this lady-cat's\r\nslyness; she kisses Bob fondly on the top of the conservatory, then with\r\nbushy tail and fur erect, she springs to the bedroom window, and enters\r\ngrowling, and casting frightened glances behind her, and her doating\r\nmistress caresses her gently, and tries to calm her fears. \"And did the\r\nnasty Tom-cat follow my litsy prettsy darling, then? And was it nearly\r\nfrightened out of its bootiful, tootiful lifie? Ah! pussy, now, then,\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nSly, sly puss. Is slyness confined to the cat creation, or is it ever\r\nfound among females of a higher persuasion--female women to wit?\r\n\r\nCats are remarkably fond of comfort, and when the usages of society compel\r\nher to be up all night at a ball or concert, she goes to bed immediately\r\nafter breakfast, and sleeps off every vestige of fatigue.\r\n\r\nI knew a cat that used to travel over six miles every other day to visit\r\nand have a gossip with another cat for which she had contracted a violent\r\nfancy. They were both lady-cats; but, strange to say, I never saw the\r\nother cat return the visit.\r\n\r\nCats will often make almost incredibly long journeys, and endure fatigue\r\nand hardships innumerable in order to find a lost master or mistress.\r\n\r\nOne cat I know travelled nearly a hundred miles into Wales, in search of\r\nher master, who had gone and left her. She had been three weeks on the\r\njourney, and when success at last crowned her efforts, she was so weak and\r\nemaciated, that she tumbled down with a fond cry at her master's feet.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of \"wandering\" cats is well known. You may \"wander\" a dog\r\neasily; but not pussy, for if so inclined, she will assuredly find her way\r\nback somehow at some time.\r\n\r\nYou may shut her up in a basket or bag and take her for miles through the\r\nmost intricate streets, or over a covered country; but in all probability\r\nshe will be back in a day or two, if indeed you do not find her on the\r\ndoor step on your return.\r\n\r\nA gentleman in the neighbourhood of London, before going to reside in the\r\ncity gave his cat away to a friend. Two years after she turned up at his\r\ncity residence; and although very thin and impoverished, manifested great\r\njoy on seeing her old master. Whether or not the party to whom the cat had\r\nbeen presented had come to live in London, and brought the cat with him, I\r\ndo not know; but the story is a fact. Moreover, the cat could not have\r\nbeen taken back on purpose, as she came by the tiles.\r\n\r\nThere can be no longer any doubt, that pussy possesses some power or\r\ninstinct which enables her to find her way back, ever so far, to the place\r\nwhere she has once resided, and that too unerringly. We cannot pretend to\r\nunderstand this, any more than we can the principle that guides the\r\ncarrier pigeon; but true it is, \"there are more things in heaven and earth\r\nthan we dream of in our philosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n[_See Note K, Addenda._]\r\n\r\n\"IS CATS TO BE TRUSTED?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Is_ cats to be trusted?\" was to have been the title of an essay from the\r\npen of poor Artemus Ward. \"_Is_ cats to be trusted?\" my starling has been\r\ntaught to repeat, and often does so while running round the cat on the\r\nfloor, examining her tail, opening up her paws with his beak, and\r\noccasionally making determined attempts to open up her nose also, and peep\r\ndown her throat. As far as she is concerned, the bird is I think perfectly\r\nsafe; for although she often pats him with her gloved hand when he gets\r\ntoo insinuating, she never otherwise attempts to molest him. I fear in his\r\nessay Artemus meant to have had a few jokes at pussy's expense. My aim is\r\na more serious one. A question like this, which to pussy is a most\r\nmomentous one, affecting not only her comfort and happiness, but her\r\nstanding as a social pet and her very existence itself, cannot be treated\r\nlightly in a work like the present. My own opinion is, and always has\r\nbeen, that if cats are properly fed and cared for, they will do anything\r\nrather than steal. But not content with giving my own experience, which\r\nsome might say was exceptional, I have placed pussy in court, as it were,\r\nand given her a long, fair, and impartial trial, summoning evidence _pro_\r\nand _con_ from every part of Great Britain and Ireland. The trial has\r\nlasted for months, and the Tichborne Case, as a Yankee would say, isn't a\r\ncircumstance to it in regard to the number of witnesses examined. The\r\njudgment has been overwhelmingly in pussy's favour, and the verdict of the\r\njury as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"_Cats are not as a rule thieves, but quite the reverse._\"\r\n\r\nIn every case investigated, where the theft was proved, it turned out that\r\nthe cat was either starved, or illtreated, or spoiled. Moreover, the\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution--in the minority--were, to use a homely\r\nphrase, a foggy lot, rude and illiterate, people with no definite ideas\r\nabout their \"h's,\" whose capitals were sown broadcast, who wrote \"i\r\nKnow,\" and spelt cat with a \"k\"; while those for the defence were in every\r\nway the reverse, both socially and orthographically; people with crests\r\nand monograms, who wrote on one side of the paper only, and all letters\r\nprepaid.\r\n\r\nSo Miss Puss I think may stand down: she leaves the court without a stain\r\nupon her character.\r\n\r\nNow, while boldly asserting that cats are as a rule honest, I do not mean\r\nto say that all are so. There are rogues among cats as well as among men;\r\nbut just as we find that the law often makes men thieves, so likewise will\r\ncats become thieves if badly treated. What can be more disgraceful than\r\nthe habit that some people have of systematically starving their cats,\r\nunder the mistaken notion that they will thus become better mousers; or\r\nthe custom of many of putting their cats out all night, no matter how wet\r\nor cold the night should be. Such treatment of pussy is greatly to be\r\ncondemned, and only tends to foster habits of uncleanliness, of thieving,\r\nand of prowling. By regular feeding, good housing, occasional judicious\r\ncorrection--when puss is found tripping--and kindness, you may make almost\r\nany cat honest.\r\n\r\nPussy does not soon forget having been corrected for a fault.\r\n\r\nBlack Tom, mentioned in a former chapter, never went back to Dan's\r\nhen-house again.\r\n\r\nA Tom-cat, called Bruce, lived some years ago, at a farm-house near\r\nDundee. This cat--honest in every other way--could never resist the\r\ntemptation to steal the cream. All efforts to cure him of this habit were\r\nresorted to in vain. But one day, Bruce, much to his own satisfaction\r\nfound himself shut up in the milk-house. When all was quiet, Bruce came\r\nfrom his corner and had a look round. What a grand and imposing array of\r\nbasins of milk and tubs-full of cream! One of the latter stood on a table\r\nbeneath the window, the edge of the tub being on a level with the sill. It\r\nwas the largest tub in the room; and blessing his luck, up jumped Bruce\r\nand began to lick. It was so delicious, and Bruce closed his eyes to get\r\nthe full flavour of it. Just then, however, some noise outside startled\r\nhim,--he knew he was sinning, and was consequently nervous,--and in\r\nturning round, he missed his feet, and fell heels over head into the tub.\r\nAlthough half-choked, so soon as he came up, Bruce struck out boldly for\r\nthe shore, but the sides of the vessel were too slippery even for a cat to\r\nhold on to; besides, the weight of the cream clogged his movements. He\r\nwould fain not have screamed, but death stared him in the face, and the\r\nidea of dying in a tub of milk, as he had seen mice die, was awful; so he\r\nopened his mouth and gave vent to a smothered yell. That yell,\r\nloud-resounding through the house, brought \"ben\" the good-wife, and\r\nBruce's life was saved at the expense of about three pints of cream; but\r\nnever more did that cat go near the milk-house. He was a reformed cat from\r\nthat day; a burning and a shining light to all the cats in the\r\ncountry-side.\r\n\r\nI know a cat--a Tom, as usual--who always sits on his master's counter,\r\nsurrounded by provisions of all sorts, but he was never known to steal.\r\nThis cat has a penchant for pickled herrings; and although he might easily\r\nhelp himself by day or night, he always prefers asking his master for one.\r\nThis he accomplishes in the usual cat fashion, by running towards the\r\nbarrel and mewing up in his master's face; and of course this appeal is\r\nnever made in vain.\r\n\r\nCats are remarkably fond of fish. The other day, a bonnie fishwife was\r\nstanding on the pavement with her creel on her back. Suddenly she was\r\nheard to scream aloud. \"For the love o' the Lord, sir,\" she cried to a\r\nbystander, \"tell me what's that on my back.\" The party addressed looked\r\nabout, just in time to see a pussy disappearing round a corner, with a\r\nlarge fish in its mouth. That was what the newspapers would call an\r\nimpudent theft, and it was certainly a clever one.\r\n\r\nIf not properly trained and cared for, pussy comes--like the Ladrone\r\nislanders--to look upon stealing as a virtue; and no wonder, for she must\r\nthink it hard to starve in the midst of plenty, and in her master's\r\nhouse. Besides, there is always two ways of viewing a matter. Out on the\r\ncoast of Africa, I have often gone on shore--for the fun of the\r\nthing--with a party of other officers, to assist in replenishing our\r\nlarder by the addition of a few fat fowls, a sucking grunter, or a kid of\r\nthe goats. I rather think we stole them; but we called these little trips,\r\n\"cutting-out expeditions;\" still we swore \"'pon honour,\" and wore our\r\nswords none the less clankingly on a Sunday morning; nor would it have\r\nbeen safe for any one to have hinted that we were dishonest.\r\n\r\nJust so with poor pussy. She is often tempted by hunger to make a little\r\nreprisal. It is vulgar to accuse her of stealing the steak, nailing a\r\nfish, or boning a cold chicken, \"cutting-out,\" is the proper term. It is a\r\nfeline virtue, from the path of which she must be seduced in early\r\nkitten-hood, and by good treatment. But poor pussy is often made the\r\nscape-goat for the sins of others.\r\n\r\n\"Mary, bring up those cold pigeons.\"\r\n\r\n\"O ma'am! how _ever_ shall I tell you? That thief of a cat--\"\r\n\r\n\"The cat must be drowned,\" says her mistress.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, ma'am! Poor thing! no, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't exactly suit Mary's book to have pussy drowned. It would\r\nseriously interfere with those nice little suppers, she is in the habit of\r\nhaving with Matilda Jane.\r\n\r\n\"Sarah, we'll have the remains of that cold lamb for supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! dear me, ma'am; I forgot to tell you, the cat has eaten every bit of\r\nit. Can open the pantry-door, just like you or I, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nI should think it could; the cat in this case being an enormous blue Tom\r\ntabby, with a stripe round one forearm, and a belt about his waist, and X\r\n99 on the collar of his coat.\r\n\r\nThe following is the story of a real feline Jack Sheppard, I have no\r\nexcuse to offer for this cat; I can only say that if he was a thief, he\r\nwas a _swell at it_.\r\n\r\nIn a sweet little village not far from the famous old town of bonnie\r\nDundee, lived, and I believe still lives, Peter McFarlane, a shoemaker,\r\nand his wife Tibbie; two as decent old bodies as you would see in all\r\nbroad Scotland. They were honest and industrious, and, as a rule, agreed,\r\nor as the folks say, they both \"said one way,\" except when Peter took a\r\ndram, when, it must be confessed, the ashes did at times find their way up\r\nthe chimney along with the smoke. They had no family but one,--a cat. A\r\nfine gentlemanly fellow he was too; dressed in the blackest of fur, and\r\nfaultless to a degree, barring that he was the biggest thief ever known in\r\nthe village, or whole country-side. Every one complained of Tom; and, as\r\nhe got older, his delinquencies were ever on the increase. Allowing\r\nthieving to be a virtue among cats of his class, Tom was a saint, and ripe\r\nfor glory long ago. The butcher, do what he liked, could not save his\r\nkidneys,--it was remarkable that Tom never touched the sausages,--he was\r\nalways content with kidneys, although if none were to be had, to pussy's\r\nhonour be it said, he did not despise a lump of steak or even a nice lamb\r\nchop. Tom was a regular customer at the fish-monger's; his weakness here\r\nbeing for Loch Fyne herrings,--they were handy; but he delighted also in\r\nthe centre cut of a salmon, and in half-pound sea-trout. It has even been\r\nsaid, that Tom did not share his custom equally among the shop-keepers,\r\nspending too much of his time at the fish-monger's counter; but, as his\r\nbiographer, I must defend his name from any such allegation. Although it\r\nmust be admitted he never paid ready-money, still he was never too proud\r\nto carry away his purchase. Tom used to enter the poor people's houses\r\nabout dinner-time, watch his chance, and purloin the meat from under their\r\nvery noses. Once he lifted the lid from a broth-pot, and decamped with the\r\nboiling chicken. This cat was never known to drink water when he could\r\nfind a milk-pan; nor milk, either, if the cream-jug was at all handy. He\r\nwas even accused of having sucked the cows; and when hard pressed with\r\nhunger, he did not despise a piece of cheese or a tallow candle from the\r\ngrocer's round the corner. He never troubled himself catching\r\nmice,--chickens came handier; and tame pigeons he found were more\r\nsatisfying than sparrows. Tom could break in or out of any place, climb\r\nanything, and jump--the neighbours all said--\"the d----l's height;\" I\r\ndon't know how tall that gentleman is at Dundee, but he must be over\r\ntwenty feet, for Tom could do that easily, and alight on his pumps. At\r\nlong-last the cat became so notorious, and the outcry against him so loud\r\nand universal, that the shoemaker and Tibbie, yielding to the entreaties\r\nof the villagers, resolved to have him drowned.\r\n\r\nOn a cold winter's night, then, honest Peter and three of the neighbours\r\nmight have been seen--had there been light enough to see them--trudging\r\nalong towards the pier, with the unhappy but virtuous Tom in a sack.\r\nArrived at the place of execution, a consultation was held as to how the\r\njob should be done. There wasn't a stone to be had, and Peter said he\r\nwasn't going to lose his sack; it was bad enough to lose the cat; so it\r\nwas resolved to take Tom out and swing him clear off into the water. More\r\neasily said than done. Tom was no sooner out of the bag, than by a\r\nsuccessful application of tooth and nail, he wriggled himself free, and in\r\na moment more was lost in the darkness. Peter scratched his head, the\r\nneighbours scratched their three heads, and they all felt funny and\r\nfoolish. They determined however not to make laughing-stocks of\r\nthemselves, so they returned to Peter's house with the joyful\r\nintelligence, that Tom was a cat of the past.\r\n\r\nHere were the fishwife and the milkwife, and the grocer and his wife, and\r\nthe butcher--who hadn't a wife, all assembled to hear the good news; and\r\nit was unanimously resolved to celebrate the event by making a night of\r\nit; and, although the people of Dundee and round-about are generally glad\r\nof any excuse to make a night of it, still it must be admitted that the\r\npresent occasion urgently called for \"cakes and whuskey.\" So the fishwife\r\nbrought salmon, the milkwife brought milk, the butcher brought steak, and\r\nthe grocer whiskey galore; Tibbie with her best new mutch did the cooking,\r\nand they all sat down to eat and to drink and be merry. No Indian\r\nvillagers, just released from the dominion of a man-eating tiger, could\r\nhave felt jollier than did those good folks at the thoughts of thieving\r\nTom's demise.\r\n\r\n\"May the deil gang wi' him,\" was one of the toasts to Tom's memory.\r\n\r\n\"And a' the ill-weather,\" was another.\r\n\r\n\"If there be,\" said the fishwife, \"an ill-place for the souls o' cats,\r\nthat black beast 'll hae a hot neuk in't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but,\" said the grocer,--a godly man and an elder of the Free\r\nChurch,--\"speak nae ill o' the dead, Eppie, but pass the whuskey, and I'll\r\ngie ye a bit sang.\" He sung the death of Heather Jock, which was by no\r\nmeans inappropriate.\r\n\r\n\"And so the nicht drave on wi' sangs and clatter,\" and the fingers of old\r\nPeter's eight-day clock were creeping slowly towards \"the wee short hour\r\nayont the twal,\" when,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, neighbours,\" says Peter, the hypocrite, \"we're a' glad the cat has\r\ngane we a' his weight o' crime on his sinfu' shou'ders. Let us eat that\r\nlast pound o' steak, finish the bottle, and gang to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip;\" and scarcely had Peter\r\ndone speaking, when the door opened, apparently of its own accord. The\r\ncold night-wind blew in with a ghostly sough, and the candles were\r\nextinguished. But lo! on the table, in their very midst, and dimly seen by\r\nthe smouldering firelight, stood Tom himself, with back erect and gleaming\r\neyes. Never was such kicking and screaming heard anywhere. The fishwife\r\nfainted, and the milkwife fainted, and the godly grocer and his wife\r\nfainted, and the butcher--who hadn't a wife at all, fell down on top of\r\nthe others, for company's sake. But Peter and the three guilty neighbours\r\nstood in a corner--dumb. When order was at length restored, and the\r\ncandles re-lit, the old shoemaker told his true version of the story, and\r\nwas very properly forgiven. But where was Tom? Tom was gone, and _so was\r\nthe beef steak_! And from that day to this, never again was Tom heard of\r\nin that sweet little village near bonnie Dundee.\r\n\r\nThat cat _was_ a thief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n[_See Note L, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nPUSSY AS A MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA careful and fond mother is our pussy-cat. In no case is her wisdom and\r\nsagacity better exhibited than in the love and care she displays for her\r\noffspring. Weeks before the interesting event comes off, pussy has been\r\n\"upstairs and downstairs and in the lady's chamber,\" looking for the\r\nsnuggest corner or the cosiest closet in which to bring forth her young.\r\nIn this matter different cats have different opinions. Some prefer a\r\nfeather-bed when they can manage it, some a bundle of rags, some an old\r\nnewspaper or humble straw, while others believe the acme of comfort is to\r\nlie inside a lady's bonnet or a gentleman's wig. Wherever pussy has chosen\r\nto have her kittens, there in that room or closet she prefers to nurse\r\nthem, and should they and she be removed to another she will persist in\r\ncarrying her offspring back to the old place, however comfortable the new\r\nbed may be. This proves that pussy like human beings of the same gender\r\nhas a will of her own.\r\n\r\nI know an instance of a cat, whose kittens were removed by her master from\r\nthe attic in which they were born, to a snug little berth in the barn. The\r\ncottage doors were closed against her, but Mrs. Puss was not to be balked,\r\nand next morning found her and her family comfortably re-ensconced in the\r\nold quarters: during the night she had smashed the attic sky-light, and\r\ncarried her kittens through one by one. Pussy gained her point and was\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nI know a lady whose cat has had a litter of _one kitten_. It is her first,\r\nand if she had produced ten she could not possibly be prouder of the\r\nperformance. It is amusing to watch the care and affection she bestows on\r\nher \"ae, ae bairn.\"[2] Her whole heart--I was nearly saying \"and\r\nsoul\"--seems bound up in it. She sits and studies it by the hour--no doubt\r\nit is its father's image--dresses it at least a dozen times a day, and\r\nwhenever she has occasion to go out, she takes this miserable little\r\nobject of her love, and rolls it carefully in the sofa tidy, so that it\r\nmay neither catch cold nor come to harm.\r\n\r\nWhen a cat finds out that there is not proper room or convenience in her\r\nowner's house for the proper rearing of her family, or that there is some\r\nchance of molestation or danger from the inmates, she never hesitates to\r\ngo elsewhere for the event. She generally selects an out-house, or in the\r\nsummer-time goes to the woods, but she never fails to return to her old\r\nabode, as soon as the kittens can take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nMary is an old, old maid,--an old maid from choice so she tells me,--she\r\ncould have been married if she had liked. \"Mony a harum-scarum\r\nne'er-do-weel,\" says Mary, \"came blethering about me when I was young and\r\nbonnie, but I ga'e them a' their kail thro' the reek, wi' their calves'\r\nfaces and phrasing mou's. Na, ne'er a man gave me a sair heart, and what's\r\nmair never shall.\"\r\n\r\nI don't suppose they ever will, for even the probability of Mary's having\r\nbeen once young seems mere tradition. Besides, Mary has centered all her\r\nearthly affections on her cat, and there is every likelihood that puss\r\nwill live as long as she herself. The old lady apologises for loving it,\r\non the ground that it is \"So clean and clever, sir, and catches mice as\r\neasy as wink;\" and whenever a dog barks on the street, she runs to see\r\nthat her pet is safe.\r\n\r\nSome months ago this pussy gave evidence that she would soon become a\r\nmother. Now as the room in which poor Mary resides is only about twelve\r\nfeet square, it was very evident there was but small accommodation for a\r\ndecent cat's accouchement. The same idea struck both pussy and her kind\r\nold mistress at the same time, and while Mary was busy going the round of\r\nher neighbours, seeking in vain for an asylum for her favourite, pussy was\r\nabsent on the same errand, and apparently with more success, for she did\r\nnot return. Mary was now indeed \"a waefu' woman,\" for days and nights went\r\npast, and no tidings came of puss. Some evil thing must have happened to\r\nher, thought the old lady. Perhaps she was shut up in some lonely outhouse\r\nand starving to death; or tumbled down a chimney; cruel boys may have\r\nstoned her or drowned her; cruel keepers may have trapped her, or, more\r\nlikely still, that rieving rascal Rover may have worried her. He was just\r\nlike the dog to do a deed of the kind, aye, and glory in it; at any rate,\r\nshe should never see her more. Alack-a-day! and Mary's tears fell thick\r\nand fast on the stocking she was knitting, till she even lost the loops,\r\nand couldn't see to pick them up again. Marvel not, oh reader, at the old\r\nmaid's emotion, pussy was her \"one ewe lamb,\" her all she had in the world\r\nto love. And weeks went past, as weeks will, whether one's in grief or\r\nnot, and it was well into the middle of the third, and getting near\r\nevening, when lonesome Mary, cowering over her little fire, heard a voice\r\nwhich made her start and listen; she heard it again, and with her old\r\nheart bobbing for joy, she tottered to the door and admitted--her long\r\nlost favourite. Pussy had no time for congratulations, she had a fine\r\nlively kitten in her mouth, which she carefully deposited in Mary's bed,\r\nand made straight for the door again. She was back again in twenty minutes\r\nwith another, which she gently put beside the first, then she went back\r\nfor another, then another, then a fifth, and when she dropped the sixth\r\nand turned to go out again.\r\n\r\n\"Lord keep us, Topsy,\" said old Mary. \"How mony mair is there? Are ye\r\ngoin' to board a' the kits in the country on me?\"\r\n\r\nBut the seventh was the last, and Topsy threw herself down beside the lot,\r\nand prepared to sing herself and them to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that Mary's cat had taken up her abode in a farmer's\r\nhay-loft, fully half a mile from her owner's house; but no one had seen\r\nher until the day she carried home her kittens. She had no doubt subsisted\r\nall the time on rats and mice, for she was in fine condition when she\r\ngladdened the old maid's heart with her return.\r\n\r\nYou may often observe that if two she-cats are living together, or in\r\nadjoining houses, one always gets and retains the mastery over the other,\r\nuntil that other happens to be nursing, when she in her turn becomes\r\nmistress, and her companion is glad to give her a wide berth.\r\n\r\nCats will go through fire and water to save the life of their kittens, and\r\nfight to the bitter end to protect them. A dog will seldom dare to attack\r\na cat while she is nursing her young. My own cat actually imposes the\r\nduties of dry nurse on my Newfoundland, \"Theodore Nero.\" His finely\r\nfeathered legs make a delightful bed for them. He seems pleased with the\r\ntrust too, and licks them all over with his tongue. In Muffie's absence,\r\nhe lies perfectly still, seemingly afraid to move lest he should hurt\r\nthem. When they get a little older and more playful, they make tremendous\r\nonslaughts on his nose and ears and tail, which the honest fellow bears\r\nwith the most exemplary patience, for he loves Muffie, although many a\r\nwild chase he gives her numerous lovers. He can't bear \"followers.\"\r\n\r\nThe other day a playfellow of his, a large Irish water-spaniel, looked in\r\nat the door just to ask if he would come for a romp for an hour, as the\r\nsun was shining, the breakers running mountains high on the beach, and any\r\nnumber of little boys to throw in sticks to them. Theodore Nero was\r\nnursing. But Muffie went, and I should think that dog felt sorry he had\r\never turned out of bed at all that morning. The cat rode him at least\r\nfifty yards from her own door, battering him unmercifully all the way.\r\nThen she came back, and sang to Nero. Poor Coolin staggered down the road,\r\nhalf blinded with blood, and shaking his beautiful ears in a most pitiful\r\nmanner; but his sorrows were only half over, for not seeing very well\r\nwhere he was running, he stumbled right upon a clucking hen and chickens.\r\nAnd she gave it to him next. If the cat warmed one end of him, she\r\nrestored the equilibrium, and warmed the other; so true is it that\r\nmisfortunes seldom come singly.\r\n\r\nCats have been often known to leap gallantly into the water after a\r\ndrowning kitten, and bring it safely to land. A case occurred only a few\r\ndays ago. Some lads stole a cat's only kitten, and after playing with it\r\nall day, proposed drowning it. With this intention they went to a\r\nmill-dam, and threw it far into the water. But the loving little mother\r\nhad been waiting and watching not far off, and, stimulated by the drowning\r\ncry of her kitten, she bravely swam towards it, and brought it on shore. I\r\nknow another instance of a cat, that saved the life of a kitten which\r\nbelonged to another cat. Her own kittens had been drowned a whole week\r\nbefore, but evidently she had not forgotten the loss; and one day, seeing\r\nfour kittens being drowned in a pool, she plunged in, and seizing the\r\nlargest brought it to bank, and marched off with it in triumph. She reared\r\nit carefully. The children baptized it Moses, very appropriately too; and\r\nit is now a fine, large Tom-tabby.\r\n\r\nA poor cat some time since nearly lost her life in the Dee, attempting to\r\nsave the life of her kitten. The river was swollen with recent rains, and\r\nthe kitten was in the centre of the stream; but, nothing daunted, pussy,\r\nlike the brave little heroine she was, plunged in, and finally reached it.\r\nHere her real danger only began, for the current was very strong, and\r\npussy was whirled rapidly down the river. After struggling for nearly half\r\nan hour, she succeeded in landing at a bend of the river nearly a mile\r\nbelow. She had stuck to her poor kitten all the time; but _the little\r\nthing was dead_.\r\n\r\nA family in Fifeshire were about removing to another farm, about four\r\nmiles distant from the one they then occupied. Part of their household\r\ngods was a nice large she-tabby, and being kind-hearted folks, they never\r\nthought of leaving her behind; so having found a home with a neighbour for\r\npussy's one kitten, they took the mother with them to their new residence.\r\nNext morning pussy had disappeared, and they were just beginning to put\r\nfaith in the popular fallacy that cats are more attached to places than\r\npersons, when back came pussy, and with her her kitten. That kitten, pussy\r\nthought, wasn't old enough for weaning, and so she had gone back all the\r\nway to steal it. She was right.\r\n\r\nOwing to the peculiarities of his matrimonial relations, the happy father\r\nof a litter of kittens shares none of the responsibility, and has none of\r\nthe care and trouble of rearing them, because he does not, as a rule,\r\nreside in the bosom of his family. When he does live with his wife,\r\nhowever, he is never exempted from family duties. And Tom always shows\r\nhimself a thoughtful husband and loving father. A male cat of my\r\nacquaintance was most exemplary in his attentions on his wife at one of\r\nthe most interesting and critical periods of her life. Made aware,\r\ngoodness knows how, of her approaching confinement, he not only selected\r\nthe closet for the occasion, but even made her bed for her, and stood\r\nsentry at the door till the whole affair was over. Every morning for weeks\r\nhe trotted upstairs, first thing, to see if his wife wanted anything, and\r\nto gaze enraptured on his darlings. I am sorry to say, however, that this\r\nlittle woman rather bullied her doating husband. If she happened to be in\r\ngood humour when Tom entered, then well and good, she returned his fond\r\ncry and chaste salute. If not, her brows fell at once, and she let him\r\nhave it straight from the shoulder. Poor Tom in the latter case used to\r\nmew apologetically, and retire. It was Tom's duty every morning to bring\r\nin a very young rabbit, a bird, or at least a mouse, and it seemed to be\r\nan understood thing that he should bring it \"all alive ho!\" When he\r\nbrought it dead, she slapped him. Sometimes he brought a herring, then she\r\nslapped him. Indeed, she lost no opportunity of slapping him. She slapped\r\nhim if he looked fond and foolish at her, and she slapped him if he\r\ndidn't. One day he was put to nurse the kittens. The kittens commenced an\r\nunavailing search for tits among Tom's fur. As a wet nurse, Tom was a\r\nfailure. He was slapped, and sent off accordingly. Tom seemed to have\r\nbusiness that took him down town every day. Whenever he came back, he was\r\nsnuffed all over and examined to see whether he had been with lady\r\nfriends. If he had been, then he was properly slapped. So there was a\r\ngood deal of slapping. His wife was fond of him, however, for, once, when\r\nhe absented himself without leave for a whole day and a night, she made\r\nthe house ring with her melancholy cries. She half killed him when he did\r\nreturn, nevertheless. Such is conjugal felicity.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as a rule, all the duties of maternity seem to end with the\r\nweaning of the kitten, still the motherly affection does not die out; and\r\nin cases of sickness in any of her children, pussy at once resumes the\r\ncares of nursing, as the following little story will illustrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGINGER AND JOSIE.\r\n\r\nAnd Josie was Ginger's mother. She was a good mother. There had been\r\noriginally five, but the others were born to sorrow, and were accidentally\r\ndrowned; so that all mother Josie's love was centred in her one son\r\nGinger. Ginger, therefore, not only got all the love, but he got all the\r\nmilk; so he grew up thumpingly and fat. Nothing remarkable transpired\r\nduring Ginger's kittenhood. He neither had the measles, nor, strange to\r\nsay, the hooping cough; and he played the usual antics with his mother's\r\ntail that all kittens do, and have done, since Noah's cats' kittens\r\ndownwards. When Josie found her milk getting scarce, she weaned her son\r\nGinger; this she accomplished by whacking him, and endeavouring to carve\r\nher initials on his nose. No doubt Ginger thought himself absurdly\r\nill-used. We have all thought the same on a similar occasion. But Ginger\r\nwas amply repaid for the loss of his tits, by the mice which his loving\r\nmamma never failed to supply him with daily. So he grew up burly, big, and\r\nbeautiful; and at the age of one year had become a mighty hunter. Then\r\ncame six long days and nights wherein Ginger never appeared, and poor\r\nmother Josie went about the house mourning unceasingly for her lost son.\r\nAt the end of that time, a pitiful mewing was heard outside, proceeding\r\nfrom the bottom of the garden, and on walking down, his owners, to their\r\ndismay, found poor Ginger, to quote his mistress's words, \"in a most\r\nlamentable plight, thin to emaciation, and coiled up on the ground\r\napparently lifeless, his fur, once so glossy and bright, now all\r\nbedraggled in blood and mud.\" The cruel keepers had been the cause of\r\nGinger's misfortunes. He had been caught in a trap. For five days, without\r\nfood or water, had the poor animal languished in a field. On the sixth he\r\nhad managed to crawl some little way, dragging the trap after him, till he\r\ncame to a gate. This he managed to get through, but the trap getting\r\nentangled, held him fast until some kind Samaritan, seeing his miserable\r\nplight, set him free from this impediment. He then crawled home, jumped\r\nthe wall, and sunk exhausted on the ground, where he now lay. Tenderly was\r\nGinger borne into the house, and laid on the hearth-rug. His leg was\r\nbroken, swollen, and entirely useless; so it was determined to have\r\nrecourse to amputation. The extremity was accordingly cut off by the\r\nowners, and, although long confined to his mat, pussy lived. Josie was\r\nvery happy to see her son again, maimed and bruised as he was, and at\r\nonce set about performing the duties of nurse to him. She seldom or never\r\nleft him, except to procure food for him; but Ginger had a regular daily\r\nsupply of dead mice, birds, and other feline dainties, until he was able\r\nto get about and cater for himself. Ginger's accident happened upwards of\r\ntwo years ago. He is still alive and well, and as strong and active on his\r\nthree legs as other cats are on four. Ginger is a fine, large cat, but has\r\nalways exhibited the greatest aversion to strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n[_See Note M, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nHOME TIES AND AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre cats more attached to places than to persons? I have taken\r\nconsiderable pains to arrive at a correct answer to this question, and not\r\nsatisfied with my own judgment and experience, as in the case of pussy's\r\nhonesty, I \"appealed to the country.\" I am happy to find that the opinion\r\nof all cat-lovers, nearly all cat-breeders, and the large majority of\r\npeople who keep a cat for utility, is that cats are as a rule more\r\nattached to their masters or owners than to their homes. This question\r\nthen must be considered as set at rest, and a stigma removed from the name\r\nand character of our dear little friend the cat. The popular fallacy, that\r\ncats are fonder of places than persons, first took its origin in the days,\r\nlong gone by, when cats were kept for use only, and never as pets; and it\r\nonly obtains now among people who look upon pussy as a mere animated\r\nrat-trap, and who starve, neglect, and in every way ill-treat the poor\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nPray don't mistake me, reader, I am not saying that pussy isn't fond of\r\nher home, in fact I am going to prove that she is immensely so; but I most\r\nemphatically deny, that she ever allows that fondness, to obscure her love\r\nfor the hand that feeds and caresses her, or the kind voice of a loving\r\nmaster or mistress.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, an intimate friend of mine, who \"loveth all things great\r\nand small,\" went to reside for a time with a family in town. A fine blue\r\ntabby was an inmate of the same house.\r\n\r\n\"That cat,\" said the mistress, \"belongs to the family that lived here\r\nbefore, it has been five times removed, and always comes back.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend only remained there for six weeks, when he changed his residence\r\nfor a house he had taken only a few streets off, but when he left, that\r\nbonnie blue tabby trotted by his side all the way home, and it _has not\r\nreturned yet_.\r\n\r\nBut there is no doubt pussy is extremely attached to her home; and\r\nnothing, I think, shows her warm-heartedness more, than her willingness to\r\nleave that home with a kind owner. A cat has so many home-ties, that we\r\nneed not wonder at her unwillingness to change her residence. Custom has\r\nso endeared her to the old place, that she cannot all at once like the\r\nnew. She knows every hole and corner of it, knows every mouse-walk, the\r\ncupboards, the cosy nooks for a quiet snooze, and the places where she may\r\nhide when hiding becomes a necessity, she is acquainted with the manner of\r\negress and ingress, and is familiar with every sound, so that her rest is\r\nundisturbed by night, and her finely-strung nervous system not put on the\r\nrack by day. Out of doors, too, everything about the old place is\r\nfamiliar, the trees on which the sparrows perch, the field where she often\r\nfinds an egg, the distant meadow corner where the rabbits play, and the\r\npath that leads thereto, which she can traverse unseen and free from\r\ndanger, either from farmers' dogs or boys with stones, and above all, the\r\ndear old trysting place, where she knows she can always meet her lovers in\r\nthe moonlight. But if she changes her quarters, all this knowledge has to\r\nbe learned over again. New dangers have to be encountered, fresh troubles,\r\nand bother of every description. Her new residence, and everything about\r\nand around it, has to be thoroughly surveyed, mentally mapped out, and got\r\nby heart before she can feel anything like at home. So that if pussy has\r\nnot the love of a kind human friend, to counterbalance all her trials, it\r\nis no wonder she will do anything or walk any length, to get back to the\r\nplace where she was so happy. And when she goes back, what does she find?\r\n\r\n                                \"A change,\r\n  Faces and footsteps and all things strange.\"\r\n\r\nShe is treated as a stray cat, and sent adrift every time she dares to put\r\nher unhappy nose inside the door. But, nevertheless, she will hang about\r\nher old home for days and weeks, until, impelled by the pangs of hunger,\r\nshe casts aside the mantle of virtue, becomes a thief, and revenges\r\nherself on the new inhabitant's pigeons, rabbits, and chickens. _Facilis\r\ndescensus Averni._ Having once robbed a roost, she would rob a church; so\r\nshe takes to thieving as a means of subsistence. The way of the\r\ntransgressor is hard: her coat becomes dry and hard, her ribs stick out;\r\nshe loses all respect for her personal appearance, frequents low\r\nneighbourhoods, keeps low company, makes night \"hideous with her howling,\"\r\nand in a general way does everything she can to earn for herself and the\r\nwhole cat community a bad name; and finally, in a few months--if not\r\nsooner by accident--succumbs to disease and dies on a dunghill.\r\n\r\nIt is with a feeling of deep regret, that even the best-treated cat bids\r\nfarewell to a place, which has so long been her home. You shall often see\r\npoor pussy, after all the furniture and fixings have been packed in the\r\nvans, run back and take a walk all round the empty desolate chambers, then\r\nreturn and submit herself to be quietly taken off to her new abode. On\r\narriving there, her very first act will be to make a tour of inspection,\r\nthrough every room and corner of the house; she will then count the\r\nmembers of the family, and if all she loves are present, if she gets a\r\ndrink of milk, and especially if there be a good fire, she will at once\r\nsettle down and begin to sing.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, a pussy of my acquaintance was condemned to death for\r\ntaking a slight liberty with the canary--in fact, she ate him. It was\r\ncertainly very thoughtless of poor puss; however she suffered for it,\r\nalthough not to the extent that was intended. She was confined in a sack\r\nwith a large stone, and sunk in the adjoining river. Nothing more was seen\r\nor heard of pussy--which, under the circumstances, wasn't considered at\r\nall surprising--for a fortnight, when one evening she walked in, and laid\r\nherself down before the fire as if nothing had happened. Wherever she had\r\nbeen, the cat had lived well, for she was both plump and sleek. Probably,\r\non escaping from the river, she had thought that a two weeks' holiday in\r\nthe woods would both benefit her health, after treatment so rough, and\r\ngive time for the evil impression which her crime had induced to wear\r\noff. If so, she was right; for she was received with open arms, and freely\r\nforgiven, and is still alive and well.\r\n\r\nA cat will travel almost incredible distances to regain her home.\r\n\r\nI know of a cat that, along with her three kittens, was sent in a hamper a\r\nlong journey across country, to a mill, where it was intended she should\r\nmount guard over the rats. Pussy, however, had no such intention; and next\r\nmorning, to the great surprise of the inmates, she was found sitting at\r\nher own door with one kitten beside her. She disappeared that same\r\nevening, and next morning returned with another kitten. In the same\r\nmanner, next night she brought home the third and last, and so settled\r\nquietly down to rear her family. This cat, I think, showed great\r\ndetermination, and a knowledge of country that would have pleased Von\r\nMoltke himself.\r\n\r\nDozens of such anecdotes might be given, but I will only trouble the\r\nreader with one more. There is a river in Scotland called the Spey; that\r\nI suppose is no news. You will also know that this river is celebrated for\r\ntwo things--salmon and celerity, it being the most rapid river in the\r\nkingdom. Near this river, on one side, is the farm of Dandilieth; and on\r\nthe other, but four miles distant, stands the dwelling-house of Knockan.\r\nOnce upon a time, then, the tenants of Dandilieth were removing to\r\nKnockan; and after the household furniture was packed on the carts, a\r\nsearch was made for the household cat. She was found in a corner of the\r\nempty house, on some straw, faithfully nursing her family of three blind\r\nkittens. A bed was made for her in the lap of one of the children; and in\r\ndue time all arrived safe at Knockan, and pussy and her family were duly\r\ninstalled in the new house. But pussy was not happy. She longed for her\r\nold home at Dandilieth; and to think, with her, was to act; and this she\r\ndid to some purpose, for on the farmer returning next day to his old place\r\nfor the purpose of conveying home the farm implements, he was astonished\r\nto find the cat in her old corner, and the three kittens safe beside her.\r\nNow, as the nearest bridge is twenty miles distant, it is quite evident\r\nthat pussy must have swum the Spey five times in a single night (three\r\ntimes with a kitten in her mouth), to say nothing of the long journeys\r\nbackwards and forwards between the two farms.\r\n\r\nAlthough of a nature not so demonstrative as that of the dog, still a cat\r\nis capable of loving its master or mistress with a love equally strong, if\r\nnot stronger. \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" may certainly be said\r\nwith regard to pussy.\r\n\r\n\"Don Juan,\" says a lady, \"is a beautiful dark tabby, with back almost\r\nblack, legs ringed like those of a tiger, short ears honourably scarred by\r\nvarious encounters with rats, stoats, etc., which he has succeeded in\r\nkilling; long tail, also ringed with tabby; rich tabby shirt, around which\r\nthere are beautiful rings of black and tabby; paws with black pads--a most\r\nloving and lovable old cat. Two years ago we left home for a 'parson's\r\nweek,' during which time the house, pussy included, was in the charge of\r\nservants. The first sound which met us upon opening the garden-gate on our\r\nreturn, was a most pitiful scream from poor Juan, who recognized our\r\nvoices and came bounding across the garden to greet us. For more than a\r\nweek he could hardly be persuaded to leave us, but spent his time in\r\npurring and rubbing round us, as though to assure himself of our\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\n\"My own cat,\" writes a lady correspondent, \"although greatly petted by its\r\nmaster, appears quite wretched whenever I go on a visit. After mewing\r\npiteously at my door for a day or two, it leaves the house, often\r\nremaining away for weeks; but his delight at seeing me, the fond rush\r\ntowards me, and his song of joy are very pretty.\" The same lady gives an\r\naccount of a venerable old tortoise-shell puss, who goes to sea with its\r\nmaster,--officer in an East Indiaman,--and keeps watch with him by night\r\nor day in all weathers. No wonder he is fond of her.\r\n\r\nI know an instance of a cat that was very strongly attached to a boy. When\r\nthis boy was sent to a distant school, pussy, after mourning for him\r\nseveral days, took to the woods and never returned.\r\n\r\nThere is surely strong proof of how deeply a cat loves its owner, in the\r\nanxiety and sorrow it evinces on seeing that owner in grief or in pain.\r\n\r\nI have an instance of a cat that is extremely attached to a little boy.\r\nThis young gentleman has very great objections to having his nails cut.\r\nWhenever this necessary operation is being performed, he sets up a howling\r\nwhich very speedily brings his faithful playmate pussy to his aid. She\r\ncomes running with all speed, and growling in unmistakable anger. She\r\njumps on his knee, and after giving him one hurried kiss and embrace, as\r\nmuch as to say, \"Be of good cheer, I shan't let them hurt you,\" she wheels\r\nround and stands on the defensive; and the nurse has to retire and wait\r\nfor a better opportunity.\r\n\r\nAnother cat is extremely attached to a little girl, whom she follows about\r\nwherever she goes. When the child comes to grief, in some of the various\r\nways incidental to early years, pussy does all she can in her humble way\r\nto pacify and comfort her, rubbing herself round her and caressing her,\r\nand saying, \"Oh! oh!\" in the same fond pitying tone she uses to her\r\nkittens.\r\n\r\nI was called the other day to see a lady in a hysterical fit; and it was\r\nmost affecting to witness the grief of her poor cat. Hearing her\r\nmistress's screams, she darted into the room, and at once threw herself on\r\nthe lady's breast, licking her neck and hands and face in the most\r\npassionate manner, stopping only occasionally to look about and growl\r\nfiercely at me, as if I had been the cause of her mistress's illness.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote shows, I think, in a very marked manner, how deeply\r\nattached pussy can be to her master, and how forgiving is her nature.\r\n\r\nRobert D----, a young man of nineteen, lived in the same house with his\r\nmother and sisters. He was by no means an exemplary youth. In fact, if he\r\nhad had his due, the ravens, according to Solomon, would have made short\r\nwork with his eyes. He had early taken to habits of dissipation, and was\r\nin the constant custom of bullying his poor mother, for money to continue\r\nhis debauches. He must have had some little good in him however, for he\r\nwas fond of his mother's beautiful black cat. Not so fond, however, as\r\npussy was of him; for, poor thing, she never seemed happy save in his\r\ncompany. One morning he was leaving his mother's room after an unusually\r\nstormy scene, when pussy met him at the top of the stair, running towards\r\nhim with a fond cry, and singing as she rubbed herself against his leg.\r\n\r\n\"Curse you!\" he cried, and kicked her to the door-mat. The look the poor\r\ncat gave him would have softened a less hard heart; in him it only roused\r\nthe innate devil.\r\n\r\n\"You're like the rest,\" he shouted; and, seizing the unhappy puss, he\r\ndashed her with all his force over the banisters. The poor creature was\r\nnot killed outright; but was so severely wounded that she died in three\r\nhours. Although bleeding all the time, and evidently in great pain, never\r\na cry escaped her, only a low moaning mew. For one moment only she\r\nbrightened up a little, when her hard-hearted, but still loved master\r\ncame in to see her before she expired. She even tried to sing, apparently\r\nanxious to show she had forgiven him; and actually died licking his hands.\r\n\r\nI know the case of an old gentleman, who was extremely fond of a very\r\npretty cat he had; and pussy loved her master dearly. Indeed, cats seem\r\nalways particularly partial to the aged. They love to sit beside them at\r\nthe fireside, and soothe them with their low, murmuring song; for they\r\nseem to know by instinct that age is but a second childhood, with only the\r\ngrave beyond. The gentleman in question died at an advanced age. Every one\r\nmissed and mourned him, but none so sincerely as pussy. She never sung\r\nagain, and nothing could induce her to leave his sitting-room. She would\r\nsit and gaze for hours at the vacant arm-chair, as if she couldn't\r\nunderstand why her eyes no longer beheld him she loved. This went on for a\r\nfortnight; then one morning poor pussy was found lying stiff and dead on\r\nthe hearth-rug. She had died of grief.\r\n\r\nI may close this chapter with another similar instance of pussy's\r\naffection for a kind master.\r\n\r\nHe was an old fiddler, who dwelt all alone in a cottage on a moor. He had\r\nlived to see friend after friend laid under the sod, and now he had none\r\non earth to care for him. Ah! yes; he had one friend--his cat. This little\r\npet cheered him in many a lonely hour; and when sickness came at last, she\r\nnever left his bedside. Then he died. She sat like a dazed creature as she\r\nsaw him lifted and placed in his coffin, and she followed the loved\r\nremains to their long home, and saw where they laid him. She never left\r\nthat churchyard living. For three days she sat on the grave; and it would\r\nhave made your heart bleed, reader, to have heard her pitiful cries.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she seemed to say to every passerby, \"he is here--my master is here\r\nwith all this load of earth on his breast. Will no one come and help me?\"\r\n\r\nOn a cold sleety morning in November she was found stretched on the\r\ngrave--in a hole she had scraped--_dead_.\r\n\r\nHas this gentle and affectionate creature met her master? Is there no\r\nhereafter for pussy? The sun of her sinless life set in sorrow.\r\n\r\n  \"Alas for love! if this be all,\r\n   And nought beyond an earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n[_See Note N, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nFISHING EXPLOITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCats are, as a rule, averse to water in every shape. If every one of us\r\nwere as much afraid of getting damp feet, there would be much less\r\ncoughing in church and theatre. Parsons might preach in peace, and actors\r\nrant undisturbed. It would be a bad thing in a business way, however, as\r\nfar as the medical profession and their friends the undertakers are\r\nconcerned; for, if the former did not work with additional zeal, many of\r\nthe latter would starve. Did you ever observe a cat crossing the street on\r\na rainy day? How gingerly she treads, how carefully picks out the driest\r\nspots, lifting each fore-paw and shaking it with an air of supreme\r\ndisgust, and finally, for the last few yards, making a reckless bolt to\r\nthe front door.\r\n\r\nPussy is a very dainty animal, cleanly in the extreme, more particularly\r\nwith regard to her personal appearance; and knowing better than any one\r\nthat fur once wet is very difficult to dry, she does not care to dabble in\r\nthe water like a duck or a Newfoundland dog. But let the occasion arise,\r\neither in the pursuit of game or in some case of necessity, and she at\r\nonce throws all her scruples overboard, and goes overboard after them,\r\nwetting both feet and fur with a will.\r\n\r\nIn _Cassell's Magazine_ lately, there is related the story of a cat, that\r\nwas in the constant habit of diving into the sea, and bringing out live\r\nfish. This is told as a great curiosity; but I can assure the reader that\r\nsuch things are by no means rare. I have known of hundreds of such cases;\r\nand they are occurring every day.\r\n\r\nJoe, a nice she-tabby, was a curious specimen of the feline fish-catcher.\r\nHer master was a disciple of Walton's. With eager and joyful looks, pussy\r\nused to watch him taking down the rod and fishing-basket, sit singing\r\nbeside him while he looked to his tackle, and rub herself against his leg\r\nwhile he prepared the invariable sandwich, as much as to say, \"Don't\r\nforget a morsel to your puss; she likewise is going a-fishing.\" Then she\r\nwould trot by his side all the way, as proud as Punch, to the distant\r\nstreamlet. Anxiously she would watch the skimming fly, squaring her lips\r\nand emitting little excited screams of delight, whenever a fish rose to\r\nnibble. Then, when a trout was landed, pussy at once threw herself upon it\r\nand despatched it. At other times, she would spring into the stream,\r\nperhaps up to the neck, and commence fishing on her own account, by\r\nfeeling with her paws below all the banks, working as hard and as eagerly\r\nas any bare-legged school-boy.\r\n\r\nA gentleman tells me, that he once possessed a cat that made a regular\r\nhabit of swimming across the river almost daily, for the purpose of\r\nkilling birds in a wood on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nGibbey was a fine, large, brindled Tom. He was a noted fisherman and a\r\ndaring and reckless poacher, so much so that the gamekeepers threatened\r\nto kill him, whenever they could catch him. They did not mind, they said,\r\nhis taking a good clean sea-trout occasionally; but the beast fished in\r\nseason and out of season. In fact, Gibbey found the spawning time much\r\nmore convenient than any other. When the salmon came up the shallow\r\nstreams to spawn in thousands, all waggling under his very nose, and to be\r\nhad for the mere lifting out, he couldn't stand that.\r\n\r\n  \"Tam tint his reason a'thegither,\"\r\n\r\nand played terrible havoc among the poor fishes. It was not so much what\r\nhe ate that the keepers grudged; but he was in the constant habit of\r\ncarrying away large fish to hide for future use; and as he generally\r\nforgot where he had put them, he still went on hiding more. Sometimes, in\r\ntaking a walk through the wood, you would find yourself suddenly sprawling\r\non all fours, having trampled on one of Gibbey's salmon. Or you are doing\r\na little bit of gardening, and come upon a grave, and turn up what at\r\nfirst sight appears a newly-born infant rolled in a rag. Only one of\r\nGibbey's salmon. What is this in the horse's trough? Has the horse\r\nconceived? Nay, the poor brute has eaten all his oats, but he could not\r\nstomach--one of Gibbey's salmon. Something has been making its presence\r\nfelt in your bed-room for days. You dream of drains and typhoid fever, and\r\nyou sprinkle Rimmell's toilet vinegar and burn pastiles in vain. Even the\r\nimmortal Condy fails to lay the dread thing. At last you peep below the\r\nbed, and with the tongs pull out--what?--only one of Gibbey's salmon.\r\n\r\nFor nine long years this cat managed to evade the law, and escape the\r\nitching fingers of the keepers. At last, however, poor Gilbert was trapped\r\nand slain.\r\n\r\nOne day, when out shooting, I met a large white cat. He was coming\r\ntrotting along the foot-path, and wore about his neck what I took to be a\r\nvery tasteful thing in cravats. It was of a dark colour, and he held one\r\nend of it in his mouth in a meditative sort of way. I was going to ask\r\nthis cat if he felt afraid of catching cold; but he appeared to shun me,\r\ntook another direction, and entered the door of a small cottage, still\r\nwearing the mysterious cravat, and still keeping one end of it\r\nthoughtfully in his mouth, so that I felt quite puzzled, and laid down my\r\ngun to scratch my head. I hate to be done. Five minutes afterwards I was\r\nat the cottage door. A pleasant little woman answered my knock.\r\n\r\n\"Might I trouble you for a glass of water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sir; but would you not come in, and have a drink of nice sweet\r\nwhey?\"\r\n\r\nI would. Tom was singing on the hearth, but he had laid aside the wrap--it\r\nwas nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"That's a fine cat you've got,\" said I, when I had finished my whey.\r\n\r\n\"He is, sir; everybody admires our Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has caught cold, I think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! no, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little sore throat, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Tom was never better in his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, my good woman, excuse me if I seem rude; but why--why on earth does\r\nhe wear a cravat out of doors?\"\r\n\r\n\"A cravat!\" cried she. \"Our Tom wear a cravat!\"\r\n\r\nThen the pleasant little woman laughed till her pleasant little sides\r\nshook and the tears ran out of her pleasant little eyes; and her laughing\r\nwas so pleasantly infectious that I was constrained to join her, and we\r\nboth laughed till roof and rafters rang again. It was pleasant, though I\r\ndid not know what I was laughing at; only I had a slight inkling that\r\nsomehow or other I had made a mighty fool of myself. When at last she did\r\nget a word out, it was,--\r\n\r\n\"Oh! sir, you're an _awful gowk_.[3] It was an _eel_.\"\r\n\r\nAn eel, was it! The cravat was an eel! And I was \"an awful gowk!\" Well, I\r\nalways guessed I was; but then she said it so pleasantly, and as soon as\r\nshe said it off she went again. I thought it was time I was going off too;\r\nso bidding her good morning, I did, and left her laughing--such a pleasant\r\nlittle woman!\r\n\r\nMillers' cats in the country are, almost without exception, fond of\r\ntaking to the water in pursuit of prey. I know an instance of a cat bred\r\nand reared at a flour mill: it was a universal custom with this pussy to\r\nwatch by the dam-side, where she might have been seen at any time either\r\nin winter or summer. She used to run along the edge of the water in full\r\ntilt after a trout until it stopped; then, seeming to take aim for a few\r\nseconds, she would dive down like an arrow from a bow, and never failed to\r\nland the fish. She was also great in catching water-rats, which she seized\r\nand killed as eagerly and speedily as any English terrier would.\r\n\r\nBut not only can cats swim and fish, but they have been known to teach\r\ntheir offspring to do so; and a knowledge of the gentle art has been\r\ntransmitted in some cat families down to the third and fourth generation.\r\n\r\nAt the mill of P----, in Aberdeenshire, some years ago, there lived a cat,\r\nan excellent swimmer and fisher, and as fond of the water as an Irish\r\nspaniel. When fishing, she did not confine herself to any one portion of\r\nthe stream; and whether deep or shallow it was all one to pussy. The boys,\r\ntoo, of the neighbourhood were not long in finding out, that, by whatever\r\npart of the rivulet they saw the miller's cat watching, there they would\r\nfind trout in greatest abundance.\r\n\r\nThis cat not only fished herself, but taught her children to do so too.\r\nThe way in which she managed this was very amusing, and shows how\r\nextremely sagacious feline nature is. When the kittens came of sufficient\r\nage, she would entice them down, some fine sunny day to a part of the\r\nstream, where the water was very clear and shallow. Here the smaller\r\ntrout-fry and minnows would be gambolling; and, making a spring, pussy\r\nwould seize one of these and bring it out alive. After letting it jump\r\nabout for some little time, to amuse the kittens and attract their\r\nundivided attention, she would kill and return it to the stream, jumping\r\nafter it and playing with it in the water to entice a kitten in. Thus, in\r\ncourse of time, the kittens could all swim and fish, and rivalled even\r\ntheir mother in quickness and daring.\r\n\r\nIf space permitted, I could give many more instances of pussy's fishing\r\nexploits; but I think I have said sufficient to prove, that they are not\r\nso averse to wet their pumps as some people imagine. I have a fine\r\ntom-kitten which I intend training to catch fish. The future adventures of\r\nthis kitten will be related in the _Animal World_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF BLINKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Tale of a Kitten, in Ten \"Mews.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dramatis Personæ._\r\n\r\n    1.

Whence he\r\ncame, or where he had resided previous to his arrival, no one can tell.\r\nAll that is positively known about the matter is this: I, the writer,\r\nretired to rest about ten by the clock on a cold and sleety night in\r\nwinter. Previous to jumping into bed, I, as usual, locked, barred, and\r\nbolted the door of my room, then, candle in hand, I peeped in below the\r\nbed, keeked into the cupboard and under the toilet-table, and even cast an\r\neye up the chimney, in order to be certain there were no robbers or\r\nmidnight assassins concealed in the premises. Being satisfied that the\r\nonly occupants of the room besides myself were Nero, Muffie, and Pretty\r\nDick, I extinguished the candle and crept quietly beneath the sheets. Now\r\nat that time there was no Blinks. Well, in the morning, like a good old\r\nboy, I awoke at seven; and after rubbing my eyes and untying my flannel\r\nnight-cap, I put my hand once more below the bed-clothes, for I could\r\ndistinctly feel something moving on my breast. I seized and hauled this\r\nsomething forth to the blessed light of day, and lo! and\r\nbehold!--Blinks--blind little Blinks!\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" cried I in astonishment, for the windows were fastened,\r\nthe door still closed, and the key-hole not unreasonably large, \"where in\r\nthe name of all creation did you come from?\" And Blinks replied in a\r\nwhisper; but I could not catch what he said.\r\n\r\nNow, from some concomitant circumstances--namely, the birth of five\r\nkittens on the evening of the same eventful day--all of whom were\r\nconsigned to a watery grave next morning, as soon as they had taken\r\nbreakfast--I say from these circumstances, I think there can be little\r\ndoubt but that Blinks is the son of my beloved cat and faithful servant\r\nMuffie; and that the name of his other parent is, and must ever remain, a\r\nmystery. Blinks was a lovely kitten, and is a lovelier cat. Of the\r\nbrightest and most varied tortoise-shell, with stately limbs and bushy\r\ncurling tail, he stalks abroad, a very prince among the feline tribes. His\r\npaws are white as mountain snow; and when he presents one to a human\r\nfriend, it feels as soft as the finest velvet. But woe be to the mouse, or\r\nrat, or rabbit, on whom those paws descend, for sharp and deadly are the\r\ndaggers hidden between those silken toes. His ears are long, his brow is\r\nbroad, and his eyes beam with intelligence; love seems to float in their\r\nliquid depths as he purrs to some fair young lady cat, but fires of hate\r\nand scorn flash from them as he gazes on a feline foe. Such is Blinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW II.\r\n\r\n_Blinks's Eyes._\r\n\r\nWhen another week had glided slowly away, and the earth--this world into\r\nwhich Blinks had been so unceremoniously thrust--had made seven\r\nsomersaults and was preparing for the eighth, Blinks, who was gently\r\nreclining in his mother's arms, opened his little red mouth and\r\nwhispered--\r\n\r\n\"My ma!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my chee-ild,\" Muffie replied.\r\n\r\n\"When will I get eyes? Ever, my Ma?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my chee-ild.\"\r\n\r\n\"When, my Ma?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the ninth day, my chee-ild,\" said Muffie. She spoke in a mournful tone\r\nof voice, for she had not yet ceased to lament the untimely fate of her\r\nother five children.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my eyes!\" cried Blinks, not heeding his mother's grief, \"won't it be a\r\njolly lark!\" and straightway he sucked himself to sleep.\r\n\r\nStrange, is it not, that any mortal creature should sleep without any eyes\r\nto sleep with; but so it was, Blinks slept.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW III.\r\n\r\n_Blinks opens his Eyes. His first thrilling Adventure._\r\n\r\nThe ninth day dawned, a day to be big with the fate of the young and\r\ninnocent Blinks, who was on that auspicious morning to open his eyes for\r\nthe first time, on a world that, heretofore, had been as dark to him as if\r\nhe had been living in an empty stone bottle with the cork in, or like a\r\nfrog in a buried teapot, or like a toad in a stone. This day the cork of\r\nthe bottle--so to speak--was to be drawn, the teapot dug up, the stone to\r\nbe broken. He had innocently asked his mamma, where the eyes were to come\r\nfrom; and she, in the beautiful imagery, which only Muffie could make use\r\nof, told him that a wee angel cattie, with snowy fur and wings all golden,\r\nwould fly gently down while he slept, and, hovering over him softly insert\r\na little bright eye on each side of his head, and by-and-by he would awake\r\nand--see.\r\n\r\nWell, the sun rose,--the bats and the owls all went to roost in haunted\r\ncastles and lonely groves, cocks clapped their wings and crew, hedgehogs\r\nfell asleep among the dewy grass, and weary authors went to bed; but\r\nBlinks like one of the ten foolish virgins, slumbered and slept. Why\r\nslumbereth our hero? Blinks had determined to lie awake the whole of the\r\npreceding and eventful night, in order to meet the first glimpse of the\r\nearly dawn with open eyes, and study the wonders of nature with his newly\r\nacquired sense of sight. I say, this is what Blinks _had_ determined to\r\ndo; it isn't by any means what he _did_ do, for long before the shadows of\r\nnight had begun to battle with the light of coming morn, poor weary\r\nBlinks's eyes--only half open--were sealed in sleep, and so he slept far\r\ninto the day. His fond mother had eaten her matutinal meal and lain down\r\nagain to watch him; Nero had had his breakfast and a long walk with his\r\nmaster; the starling had been piping and chattering from an early hour;\r\ncarts and cars and carriages had been rolling and rattling past; trains\r\nhad shrieked, and puffed, and stopped, and backed, and puffed, and gone on\r\nagain; and still Blinks was slumbering.\r\n\r\nA very prolonged scream from an express train awoke him at last, however;\r\nand our young hero sprang to his feet, gave a jerk with his brows, a nod\r\nof his head, and behold! his eyes, like the eyes of Adam and Eve, were\r\nopened; and, like Tam o' Shanter,\r\n\r\n  \"Vow! he saw an unco' sight!\"\r\n\r\nStrange, too, that at the same moment one of Her Majesty's ships, that lay\r\nin the bay, began to fire a salute of twenty-one guns. [Blinks here bids\r\nme say there was nothing strange about it.] No wonder then, that Blinks\r\nthought himself lord of the universe and monarch of all he surveyed; no\r\nwonder--a pair of real eyes and a salute of twenty-one guns. Ho! ho!\r\n\r\nFunny-looking eyes they were too; light grey and glassy, and with scarcely\r\nany visible pupils or centre-bits. Blinks stood for a moment, evidently in\r\na very undecided frame of mind, like one who has too much to do and can't\r\ntell where to begin. He appeared to be looking very earnestly, and\r\ninquiringly at nothing in particular, and was withal rather shaky about\r\nthe extremities. It was only for a minute however, for, on turning his\r\nhead on a pivot, his eyes fell on the well-pleased and admiring face of\r\nhis mamma, who had paused in the very act of washing her face with a\r\nspittle or two, that she might gaze on her youthful prodigy. So intent,\r\nindeed, was she, that she did not even lower the fist she had been\r\nlicking; but sat with it raised in an attitude of such grace and beauty,\r\nthat, had it been done in the theatre royal, would have brought down the\r\nhouse. Now, although Blinks had had a long and intimate acquaintance, with\r\nhis mother's honest face, it must be remembered that he only knew her by\r\nthe touch or feel; and not having _seen_ her before, how should he,\r\nBlinks, be expected to tell who or what she, he, or it was that now gazed\r\non his face?\r\n\r\n\"Might it not,\" thought Blinks, \"be some dreadful foe? Good heavens! might\r\nit not be a _wild mouse_?\"\r\n\r\nThe thought was certainly alarming enough, and he determined to, at once,\r\nact on the offensive; so, as a commencement of hostilities, he gave a\r\nwarlike leap backwards, \"in order,\" as he afterwards remarked, \"to make\r\nthe spring the more dreadful.\" This backward leap did to be sure cause him\r\nto lose his balance. [Blinks here begs me to substitute the word\r\n\"equilibrium\" for \"balance,\" as the latter is not soldier-like, and\r\nreminds him of shop-keepers and such.] Having found his balance\r\n[\"Beastly!\" says Blinks,--who, as I write, is sitting on and looking over\r\nmy shoulder,--\"beastly English! Can't you say, 'regained his centre of\r\ngravity,' you dolt.\"] Well, well, Blinks got on his pins again; then was\r\nhis back erected like unto a Gothic arch, on which the hair did bristle\r\nlike unto a fretful porcupine, or a cheap ham; his tail was transformed\r\ninto a miniature bottle-brush, and from his jaws came a sound, intended to\r\nbe at least awe-inspiring, but which an impudent author might liken to the\r\nstriking of a lucifer-match. All this was but the work of a second, and\r\nonly preparatory to a grand spring--a spring which, it is needless to say,\r\nwould have resulted in the total demolition of all good looks in the face\r\nof his worthy parent. But, just then, struck with admiration at the pluck\r\nof her son, Muffie burst into a song of praise.\r\n\r\nBlinks listened.\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes, and listened again.\r\n\r\n\"That voice!\" he cried, \"them music!--it is--it is my ma.\"\r\n\r\n\"My chee-ild! my chee-ild!\" cried the fond parent; and Blinks, in the\r\ntwinkling of--of--of a little star, was encircled by the hairy arms of his\r\ndear dam with a tit[4] in each hand, and one in his mouth.\r\n\r\nThen, and not till then, did pretty Dick say, \"Bravo! bravo!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW IV.\r\n\r\n_Further Adventures of Blinks._\r\n\r\nAfter the dreadful adventure related in chapter third, exhausted nature\r\ncoveted nutrition; that is, Blinks felt thirsty, and for the suck-seeding\r\n[succeeding] sixty minutes, Blinks was busily engaged discussing a dinner\r\nof _tit_-bits. He wandered from one tit to another, and from the other tit\r\nto the next, and so on to the last, and then back again to the first.\r\n\r\nCouldn't he stick to one tit? \"No, sirree!\" Blinks would have replied,\r\n\"the foremost tits contain butter, the next cream, the next sweet milk,\r\nand the last whey. My brethren and sistren should have got the whey--they\r\nshould, but then my brethren were drowned in the sistren [cistern]--good\r\njoke, that, for a nine-days' wonder. Eh?\"\r\n\r\nHaving at length satisfied the cravings of nature, and filled his belly\r\n[Blinks fainted when he heard this expression, and on reviving bade me,\r\ntry again], well, then having laid up a little store of the lacteal fluid,\r\nagainst further claims for sustenance, Blinks carefully put aside the\r\nskim-milk tit, as a thing all very good in its way, but which a hero 216\r\nhours old, and with real eyes, ought to despise. He laid it past, and\r\nwheeling carefully round on one end, stood up, staggered for an instant,\r\nand finally reopened his new organs as wide as he could, and stared right\r\nin front of him, apparently with no very decided intention of what to do\r\nor how to do it. Just then there fell upon his listening ears--he had two,\r\none for each eye, and was very proud of them too--a sound which made him\r\nstart and turn red, so to speak, with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Was it possible?\" he mused. \"DID his ears deceive him? DID he hear a\r\nlaugh? A laugh! nay, even a sneer, a low snigger.\"\r\n\r\nHe gazed steadily in the direction from which the noise seemed to proceed;\r\nand \"dang his eyes\" if it wasn't repeated, wantonly repeated, daringly\r\ndone again; and evidently the insult was aimed at him, for there, not many\r\nmiles away, at most, were two great round goggle eyes a-glowering at him\r\nover a book, and a horrid great fleshy face all round them, with tufts of\r\nbristly hairs hanging from the cheeks, and a mouth with lips from which\r\nagain came the sneer--the low insulting snigger.\r\n\r\nNow Blinks, in the days of his darkness, had often heard the same\r\ndespicable sound; and Blinks's mamma called the voice Master.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" thought he, \"Blinks have a master! Blinks, the nine days' wonder!\r\nBlinks, with two real eyes! But, dash those same two eyes! the thought was\r\nslavish. No, he wouldn't give a suck for himself if he would bear it; and\r\nthen that laugh, that snigger--come, he would at once go on the war-path,\r\nfind out this ogre which his mamma,--the old idgit [idiot]--called master;\r\nand demolish for ever, and crush into the minutest smithereens, the mouth\r\nthat dared to sneer, the lips that dared to snigger. Dash his eyes if he\r\ndidn't, that was all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Walking _was_ difficult, though,\" so Blinks continued to muse and talk,\r\n\"over a confounded rug too. _Would_ his ma kindly take her stupid,\r\nawkward-looking stump of a tail out of his way? So-ho-oh! Gently! Hang it\r\nall!\"\r\n\r\nWith this last exclamation Blinks tumbled off the rug, fell three long\r\ninches through the air, and screamed lustily for his ma.\r\n\r\n\"My ma! my ma!\" roared Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"My chee-ild! my chee-ild!\" cried his ma, \"I am with thee, my chee-ild;\"\r\nand he was forthwith carried by the nape of his warlike neck to his downy\r\nbed, and--happy thought--he would have a drink, and then ask his ma to get\r\nhim a little golden carriage, with four white mice as horses, and a\r\nboy-mouse in buttons behind. For why? _He_, Blinks, was never made to\r\nwalk, nor meant to walk, nor did he mean to walk; for it was mean to walk,\r\nand he couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't. So from thinking Blinks came to\r\ndreaming; then he once more slumbered and slept, while his mother, sitting\r\nover him, nodded and sang.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW V.\r\n\r\n_The Ogre. Blinks Goes Abroad into the World._\r\n\r\nBut it was fated that Blinks should not slumber long; he was soon awakened\r\nby the rattling of plates; or, to speak more poetically,\r\n\r\n  The deafening din of dindling delf,\r\n    The clinking clang of knife and fork,\r\n  As some poor wretch regaled himself\r\n    On early greens and roasted pork.\r\n\r\nHe gazed in the direction of the sound, which seemed to him like the noise\r\nof fifty bulls and a corresponding number of steam-hammers turned loose in\r\na china-shop. The goggle-eyed ogre was feeding himself. His huge form was\r\nperched aloft on a wooden erection supported by four massive pillars. In\r\none hand he held a large knife, bigger than Blinks's body; in the other he\r\ngrasped a mighty trident, and our hero gazed in mute and mewless\r\nastonishment, at the immense shovelfuls of mash, and the tremendous lumps\r\nof sodden flesh the gigantic monster made disappear down his maw, and the\r\noceans of coloured water that went gurgling down his gullet. Then began\r\nBlinks to reason with himself and commune with his own thoughts, after the\r\nfollowing fashion: \"The world must be rid of such a monster, the Herculean\r\nlabour must fall on him--Blinks. Would he flinch? No! Perish the thought!\r\nAnd then, had he better slay the ogre at once, and mingle his blood with\r\nhis Irish stew, or wait until he had gorged himself.\" The latter plan,\r\nafter much deliberation, our young and hairy hero determined to adopt; for\r\nand because, no doubt, and to wit, in all probability after the ogre had\r\neaten his fill, he would give a grunt like a satisfied mother-sow, give a\r\ngrunt, tumble down in a corner, and sleep for a fortnight; and Blinks\r\nswore by every hair in his (Blinks's) whiskers, he never again should wake\r\nin this world.\r\n\r\nHis mind being now fully made up, Blinks carefully washed his face, using\r\nup two spittles for that purpose. He had thought of having a bath; but\r\nthen that would have taken time and ten spittles, and he was in a hurry,\r\nand deliberating had dried his mouth. He then lowered himself gently over\r\nthe edge of the rug, and, for the first time in his life, stood alone in\r\nthe world. Many and varied were the sensations that stole over his\r\ninnocent mind, as he stood for a moment to gaze wonderingly, admiringly\r\naround him. The words of Byron came to his lips,\r\n\r\n  And now I'm in the world alone\r\n    And eating kitchen-fee,[5]\r\n  Why should I not the butter bone?\r\n    For the d----l a mouse I see.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Blinks, \"I will go abroad upon the surface of the earth, and\r\nwalk about to and fro like a roaring lion seeking whom I may devour.\"\r\n\r\n\"My chee-ild! my chee-ild!\" cried his fond and doating dam from the rug.\r\n\r\n\"Your grandmother!\" answered the irreverent son.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, oh! stay,\" exclaimed his sorrowing parent, catching a fly and\r\nswallowing it in her anguish. \"Stay, my too sensitive chee-ild, and\r\nrecline your little head on this here hairy bosom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is much too hot to be happy,\" said Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! stay with me,\" continued Muffie. \"Will you not be the prop of my\r\ndeclining years?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never a prop,\" quo' Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the parent, \"I myself abroad shall go.\"\r\n\r\nBut Blinks was off, crying, \"Not for Joe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW VI.\r\n\r\n_A Terrible Sight._\r\n\r\nCarefully advancing one foot a time, our young hero slowly made his way\r\nacross what appeared to him an interminable desert. The ground was soft\r\nand mossy, and here and there clusters of mighty pillars (which he\r\nafterwards found were called chair-legs) towered skywards. He passed a\r\ngreat many strange things, and heard a great many strange sounds that he\r\ncould not tell the meaning of; at last he arrived at the foot of a tall\r\niron wall (the fender?), round which he waddled for many a feline mile;\r\nbut finding no gate at which to knock, he resolved to scale the barrier\r\nand solve the mystery. So he raised himself on his hind-legs, thinking at\r\nthe same time how handy hind-legs were, and how happy he was to possess\r\nsuch appendages; then he gazed over the wall. The sight that was presented\r\nto him, would have turned a hero less brave into whinstone. But Blinks was\r\nBlinks.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be a great blazing volcano, surrounded, or rather ribbed\r\nin, by gigantic bars of steel; in fact it looked like a small bad-place,\r\nin which he had no doubt the souls of dogs, and the gizzards of birds were\r\ngetting purified of their sins. On the top thereof was a mighty cauldron,\r\nand the steam therefrom rose in dense clouds, and disappeared in the\r\nblackness of darkness; and there was much smoke and flame, and a loud\r\nspluttering noise, accompanied by hissing and crackling. And lo! even as\r\nhe gazed, a mighty ball of fire was thrown out by a small and ugly fiend,\r\nthat dwelt below the cauldron in the midst of the ardent element; and the\r\nball of fire fell within a whisker-length of our gallant Blinks, who just\r\nthen remembered that he was getting thirsty, and could spare time to gaze\r\nno longer. So, after casting one defiant glance at the ugly little fiend\r\nthat crouched beneath the cauldron, he left the little Hades and journeyed\r\non in quest of adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW VII.\r\n\r\n_The Cricket of the Hearth. Pretty Dick._\r\n\r\nBlinks had not travelled many legs (leagues?) till he was met by a very\r\nfunny little ill-shaped gentleman. He was like a very wee mahogany table,\r\nbut not much bigger than Blinks's mamma's red nose (if _it_ had been a\r\nmahogany table); and he had two big nippers hanging down in front of him;\r\nand Blinks observed that he also had too small black eyes like the points\r\nof as many needles, and very shiny they were, and altogether very knowing\r\nand wicked-looking. Blinks stopped, and the little mahogany gentleman\r\nlaid a dead fly on the ground, and did the same.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho! Mr. Fluff,\" said the latter, looking up at Blinks with one eye\r\nand shutting the other, as if he had no immediate use for it, and thought\r\nthat one was enough for the occasion. \"Ho! ho, Mr. Fluff; so you're\r\nlearning to crawl, are you? Eh? Does your mother know you're out? Eh?\"\r\n\r\nBlinks was highly indignant at this style of address, and also at being\r\ncalled Fluff, so he replied with considerable dignity,--\r\n\r\n\"I am not Fluff, sir; I am Blinks, _Blinks_, sir; and I may inform you,\r\nsir, that my maternal relative is entirely cognisant of my being abroad,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blinks, are you?\" said the little fellow, not at all abashed. \"Blinks!\r\nHe! he! he! a pretty Blinks _you_ are. Let me see you.\" And the small\r\nbrown gentleman commenced running round him so quickly, that Blinks, in\r\ntrying to wheel on a pivot, fairly rolled over on his back; and the man of\r\nmahogany was forced to hold his sides with laughing.\r\n\r\n\"He! he! he--e!\" he laughed, and \"Ha! ha! haa--a!\" and \"Ho! ho! hoo--o!\"\r\nand then \"He! he! hee--e!\" again; and then \"Oh dear!\" he cried \"I shall\r\nsplit;\" and the tears ran out of his needle points and down over his nose\r\nand nippers.\r\n\r\nTo say that Blinks was angry, would but poorly describe the torrent of\r\nwrath that raged within his youthful breast. After carefully gathering\r\nhimself up again, he confronted the wee brown gent, and----\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" cried Blinks, \"imp or devil, tell me who you are and where you\r\ndwell; and should it even be in yonder evil-place, beneath yon horrid\r\ncauldron, a friend of mine shall wait upon you in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said the mahogany one, drawing himself up to his full height, which\r\nwas not much after all--\"I, sir--I am, sir, the cricket of the hearth,\r\nsir! the cricket--of--the--hearth, sir; and I have a good mind to pull\r\nyour nose, sir;\" here he shook one pair of his immense nippers; \"and the\r\nnose, sir--\" here he shook his other pair of nippers--\"of the ignorant old\r\nlady, your mother, who allows her fluffy fools of children, to trespass\r\nupon, and insult grown gentlemen on their own policies.\" The little gent\r\nwould have added much more; but just then he was interrupted by a loud\r\nvoice, apparently in the air, making the remark--\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! br-r-ravo! bravo!\" And looking up, Blinks espied a very large bird\r\nperched on a high wooden erection; the cricket of the hearth was observed\r\nto turn very pale at the same time. I say, he turned pale; and he also\r\nturned tail, and muttering, \"Fire and fury!\" made off as fast as six legs\r\ncould carry him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll fluff you,\" cried Blinks; and was about to give chase, when the bird\r\nalighted on the ground in front of him, and almost at the same time the\r\ncricket disappeared, as suddenly as if he had vanished from the face of\r\nthe earth; and indeed that is precisely what he had done.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Blinks, \"what has become of our little mahogany friend?\"\r\n\r\nThis question he put to the bird, who was now standing in a very ludicrous\r\nattitude, with his head and neck all awry, and a big swelling or lump in\r\nhis throat, as if he had been improperly hanged.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear me?\" said Blinks, as the bird made no immediate answer and\r\nappeared slightly convulsed.\r\n\r\n\"Ca-can't--you--see,\" said Pretty Dick; for it was no other, and he spoke\r\nwith great difficulty--\"can't you see--I'm--chic-chu-choking?\" at last\r\ngetting out the word and straightening his neck at the same time. \"I ate\r\nhim--bravo! Pretty Dick, whew, whew, whew;\" and he burst into the \"Sprig\r\nof Shillelah\" and finished off with two bars of \"Duncan Gray.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Blinks, standing aghast, \"did you real--you don't\r\nmean to say that you positively swallowed him, you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Positively, damme,\" said the bird. \"Tse, tse, tse, whew, whew, whew;\r\nhurra, hurra, hurra! Bravo, Dick! He is now engaged turning over the\r\nstones in my gizzard and counting them; I fear I am two or three short.\r\nAfter that job is finished, I shall bring him up again, break him in\r\npieces, and eat him properly. Whew, whew, whew! Bravo, Dick! Sugar,\r\nsnails, and brandy! Tse, tse, tse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Monstrous!\" said Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"Is the darling starling pretty, snails?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\" said Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you spoke,\" said Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said the bird, \"I often talk to myself. What is that between your\r\ntoes?\" So saying, the bird hopped up to Blinks, and separating his toes\r\nwith his beak in a very rude manner, he gazed between them.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that again, if you please,\" said Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, if you desire it. Cock-a-doodle-doo, sugar and brandy,\r\npretty darling; but what is that in your nostril? Sugar, snails.\" And\r\nbefore our hero was aware, the starling's bill was inserted, opened like\r\nthe toes of a compass, and the nose of poor Blinks nearly torn open. This\r\nwas too much of a good thing; and Blinks aimed a cuff and fired a\r\nlucifer-match at the bird, causing that gentleman to spring quickly\r\nbackwards and ejaculate.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! hurrah! you rascal! Love is the soul of a nate Irish snail, you\r\nrogue.\" After which he brought up the poor cricket again; and he, glad to\r\nsee day-light again, said, \"Thank you, sir,\" and was moving off.\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't now!\" said the bird, seizing him by the hindermost leg.\r\n\"How many stones in my gizzard, you unhappy little wretch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, mercy!\" cried the cricket, \"I entirely forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then down you go again,\" said the starling; and down the cricket went.\r\n\r\nBlinks stood gazing, horror-stricken, when the bird, piping a few bars of\r\na tune, wheeled suddenly round, and made a determined effort to compass\r\nout Blinks's eye.\r\n\r\n\"Is that an eye?\" said he, as if he didn't know.\r\n\r\n\"Rather,\" said Blinks, a little proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Then give us a bit,\" cried Dick. \"Chickey, chick, chick; whew-w-w, whew,\r\nwhew. Snails and brandy! Pretty starling! bravo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said Blinks, \"it strikes me you're a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\"No I ain't,\" said the bird, \"only a foolosopher--always gay, you know.\r\nLove is the soul of a darling pretty starling; but I say, you know, you\r\nand I will be excellent friends, and you shall play in my cage, and I will\r\ngive you sugar, snails, and brandy. Quack, quack, quack. Don't be\r\nfrightened, it's only my fun; and now I must be off, master will want me\r\nto sing to him after dinner. He has just finished his sucking pig; he\r\nplays the fiddle and I sing. Just fly up with me on the table; but, oh! I\r\nforgot, you awkward creature,\"--digging Blinks in the ribs,--\"you haven't\r\nthe vestige of a wing; well, my master----\"\r\n\r\n\"The ogre?\" said Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" cried the bird, \"just you call him an ogre, and he will soon have\r\na new string to his fiddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Blinks.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said the starling, \"he has a pretty little box called a violin,\r\nfilled with the souls of defunct cats, your brothers and sisters are all\r\nthere,--and their insides are made into strings, and stretched all over;\r\nand when he tickles the strings with a hair, they all cauterwaul. Master\r\nsings, and pretty Dickie sings--Chick, chick, chick; chirl, chirl, chirl.\r\nBut, snails and brandy! I'm off.\" And away flew the beautiful bird, who\r\nwas all shiny with black and blue and silver; and Blinks sat for quite a\r\nlong time gazing up after him with his lack-lustre eyes; and then, getting\r\nto his feet, he commenced walking homewards, musing on all the strange\r\nthings he had seen and heard.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW VIII.\r\n\r\n_Terrible Adventure with a hairy Snake._\r\n\r\nBlinks's ma lived away in a corner, on a rug of large dimensions; and he\r\nhad a very long way to walk over the trackless plain, over the pathless\r\ndesert, over the bounding prairie; and night too was beginning to creep\r\ndown, and Blinks thought he could perceive enemies lurking in every\r\ncorner, and monsters hiding in every shade; so that, had he been anything\r\nless than Blinks, he would certainly have thought it worth while being\r\nafraid; but being Blinks, he marched bravely on, only just by way of\r\ncaution he gave an occasional glance over his right shoulder, then one\r\nover his left, then one behind, all the while keeping a sharp look-out\r\nahead. Happening to look round, to his astonishment he beheld something\r\nlike a snake, with its head reared high in the air, apparently following\r\nhis every footstep. This caused Blinks to quicken his pace. He soon looked\r\nround again. The creature, whatever it was, was still there, waving its\r\nhead from side to side, and evidently looking at Blinks with all its\r\nmight; although never an eye it had at all that he could see.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" thinks Blinks, \"I'll spring smartly round and seize it.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done; and brave Blinks jumped suddenly about and\r\nattempted to catch the snake--which was twice as tall as himself and\r\ncovered with hair--by the throat. But the creature was too wide-awake,\r\nand when Blinks turned round, so did it. So round and round spun Blinks,\r\nand round and round went the hairy serpent, and always kept directly in\r\nour hero's rear,--when he stopped it stopped, and when he went round again\r\nit went round again. At long last poor Blinks began to feel dizzy; but he\r\nwas much too brave to think of giving in, till, finally, he tumbled on his\r\nback, and then the snake peeped up between his hind legs,--that is,\r\nBlinks's hind-legs; for serpents never have hind-legs, by any chance.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" says Blinks, \"Mr. Sea-snake, I'll have ye now, without any more\r\ngoing about the bush.\" So saying, he caught the creature by the end, just\r\nwhere his eyes would have been had he had any,--he caught it, and bit it;\r\nand as he did so, Blinks himself uttered a sharp cry of pain, and bit the\r\nsnake again, and then cried again, and licked the part of the snake he had\r\nbitten tenderly with his tongue; this went on with great vigour for a\r\nlength of time. At last Blinks desisted, and--\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm jiggered,\" says he, \"if it isn't a part of myself I've been\r\na-running from, and a-fighting with, and a-chewing at, all the time. How\r\nprovoking! and I don't know any bad words, else wouldn't I swear! Memo: to\r\nmake my ma teach me to say bad words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! Brr--r--ravo!\" cried pretty Dick, who, perched on a stool, had\r\nbeen watching all the performance with singular interest.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo yourself,\" cried Blinks, indignantly; but he felt very foolish\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how Blinks came to the knowledge that he possessed, that very\r\nuseful and ornamental appendage called a tail; and that extremity was ever\r\nafterwards viewed by him with great interest, and treated with the utmost\r\nrespect,--Blinks conducting himself with conscious pride and dignity, as\r\nbehoves an animal of the feline persuasion who is possessed of two eyes,\r\nand is followed about, wherever he goes, by a living, moving,\r\ngracefully-waving tail.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW IX.\r\n\r\n_Daring ascent of a Volcanic Mountain._\r\n\r\nAfter another half-hour's walk Blinks arrived at the foot of a great black\r\nmountain, all covered with rank black grass. The mountain had much the\r\nresemblance of a huge lion couchant.\r\n\r\n\"Seems a long way to walk round,\" said our hero; \"I'll even go over, and\r\nI'll get a fine view of the surrounding country from the top.\" So saying,\r\nBlinks mentally girded up his loins, and began to climb. It was very\r\nsteep, and very high, and he had to pause many times to take breath; but\r\nhe cast no longing lingering look behind,--that wasn't _his_ nature. So he\r\nmuttered, \"Excelsior,\" putting a great emphasis on the \"r,\" which is the\r\npet letter of the feline race. After much toil and trouble, he stood on\r\nthe highest peak of Mount Black;--and, St. Mary! what a scene burst upon\r\nhis astonished eyes. The sun had gone down behind the distant\r\nwindow-frame; but the ogre had just lighted two moons, and placed them\r\nconveniently on the end of brass pipes, for which kind action Blinks\r\npostponed his execution _sine die_. Everything was thus rendered nearly as\r\nbright as day. As far as his eye could reach, nothing was visible but the\r\nflowery prairie, the ogre's legs, and the great beams supporting the\r\nuniverse. The view was bounded by flowery walls, which, he doubted not,\r\nwas the end of the world, while far away in a corner, the well-pleased and\r\nfoolishly-affectionate-looking face of his mamma looked up from her rug.\r\nShe spied her son, even at that distance, and turned up the white of her\r\nbreast to lure him down.\r\n\r\n\"The old idiot,\" said Blinks to himself, \"how _can_ she be so ridiculous\r\nand unromantic? Would Livingstone's mamma do that to her son, if she\r\nespied him far away on the Peak of Teneriffe? No!\"\r\n\r\nBlinks was gazing skywards, and thinking that if he were spared to return\r\nto his native rug, he would write a book that would astonish the weak\r\nnerves of the tea-guzzling universe, and beat all creation, when he began\r\nto fancy he could hear a low rumbling noise beneath his feet, and\r\nperceive a slight heaving motion in the body of the mountain. He bent down\r\nand listened. Yes! there it was;--there could not be a doubt of either\r\nfact; and, terrible thought! he stood on the summit of a living volcano.\r\nBut he did not fear; nay he even caught himself singing for joy; but in a\r\nmoment his joy was turned to very particular grief, and his wonder to\r\nsomething as nearly akin to fear as the heart of a Blinks could beat time\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\"For,\" says Blinks, \"isn't it rising I am? Isn't it bigger and bigger the\r\nmountain is getting?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any question of it at all; and Blinks hurried down the\r\nside of the mountain as fast as four legs could carry him; but judge, if\r\nyou can, of his astonishment to find that the hill itself had four legs,\r\nas well as he himself had; so that unless he could manage to creep down\r\none of these, he would have to leap through the sky, down--down--down to\r\nthe vast plain below. For a moment only he stopped to think, to bring all\r\nthe wonderful powers of his great mind to bear upon the terrible\r\nsituation; but just then his deliberation was brought to a speedy\r\nconclusion; for, wonderful to relate, the whole head of the hill turned\r\nabout, and looked him directly in the face with a pair of eyes as big, so\r\nthought he, as fish-ponds; while at the same time a great cold nose was\r\nthrust right beneath him, and he was hurled headlong to the plain below,\r\nand the volcanic mountain--which cats, jealous of the immortality of\r\nBlinks, have since averred was nothing else but the ogre's large dog\r\nNero--shook itself and walked away to the other end of the boundless\r\nprairie. And Blinks confessed, many days afterwards, that at that moment,\r\nthough by no means afraid, he would not have undertaken to say whether his\r\nhead or heels were uppermost. After all, no wonder; for at that precise\r\nmoment Blinks lay on his back, and the world consequently had an\r\nup-side-down look about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEW X.\r\n\r\n_The Ogre. The Baptism of Blinks._\r\n\r\nIt might have been thought that the trials and adventures of Blinks were\r\nnow at an end for one day; but, no,--he had still another to add to the\r\nlist. He had come through fire and earth and air; he was now to come\r\nthrough water. One other weary mile he had yet to wander, ere he could lay\r\nhis war-worn head on his mother's breast; and this mile he was engaged\r\nplacing behind him, when, suddenly, and ere he was aware, a gigantic hand\r\nwas laid upon him, and he was carried swiftly through space, wheeled\r\nquickly round, and immediately found himself face to face with--horror of\r\nhorrors!--the ogre.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho! my little gentleman,\" so spoke the ogre; \"you've been and gone\r\nand got a couple of peepers\" (that is what the ogre termed Blinks's eyes,\r\nsuch desecration of terms can scarcely be credited, but it is indeed\r\ntrue),--\"a couple of peepers, queer blue-grey blinkers they are too; so,\r\nso, you must be baptized, then.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be observed here, that although our hero had got a name, the\r\nceremony of baptism had not yet taken place. The ogre then pronounced\r\nthese remarkable words, swinging our little hero through the immensity of\r\nspace at every word, and finally plunging him feline fathoms below water,\r\nin a dark wooden-bound lake of murky water (bucket?).\r\n\r\n\"In the name--of your father--and your mother--and your sister--and your\r\nbrother--who all--made a living--in the--software line--I baptize you\r\nBlinks.\"\r\n\r\nDown, down, down, did the ogre plunge Blinks, and the dark waves, cold and\r\ncruel, closed remorselessly over his head. Then did Blinks gasp,--he\r\ngasped, he spluttered and spluttering spat, kicked violently, and kicking,\r\nsunk into insensibility. When he revived, he found himself in the hairy\r\narms of his loving ma, who was licking his wet and shivering body with\r\nloving tongue. Blinks soon dried; then tired out, war-worn, and weary, he\r\nsunk to rest with a tit in his mouth, while his mother crooned over the\r\nfollowing song, taught her by _her_ mother,--Blink's grandma,--in the\r\nhappy days of her playful kittenhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THREE THREADS.\r\n\r\n(_Tune_, PURR--WURR-R-R,--PURR--WURR-R-R.)\r\n\r\n  Hirple, dirple, dirrum dum,\r\n  Three threads and a thrum,[6 (1)]\r\n        The wee bit mousie\r\n        Made a housie,--\r\n  Made a housie in a drum;\r\n        Scraped a hole,\r\n        And made a housie,--\r\n  Made its housie in a drum.\r\n\r\n  The three threadies and a thrum,\r\n  If ye canna sing, ye just maun hum;[6 (2)]\r\n        When the mousie sleepit,\r\n        Pousie creepit,--\r\n  Creepit slily to the drum;\r\n        Popped a paw in,\r\n        Clook't a claw in,--\r\n  Clook't a claw in the mousie's wum.\r\n\r\n  Och, hey, how, hum,\r\n  Three threadies and a thrum:\r\n  If ye canna sing, ye maun be mum.\r\n        The mousie grat,[6 (3)]\r\n        The cattie spat,\r\n  And hauld the thingie frae the drum:\r\n        It winked its eenies,[6 (4)]\r\n        Like heads o' preenies,[6 (5)]\r\n  Gave ae wee cheep and syne[6 (6)] was dumb.\r\n\r\n  Fee, fa, fi, fum,\r\n  Cheer up my dear, and look na glum:[6 (7)]\r\n        I bit off its heed,[6 (8)]\r\n        I lickit its bleed,[6 (9)]\r\n  And gnawed the beanies[6 (10)] beside the drum:\r\n        Just three sips,\r\n        And I lickit my lips,--\r\n  Lickit my lips, and then said \"Num!\"[6 (11)]\r\n\r\n  \"Tinkle, tankle, tingle, tum,\r\n  Weel, weel, and isn't it rum?\r\n  There is nae musie in the drum,\"\r\n        The manie cried,\r\n        When he spied\r\n  The mousie's holie in the drum.\r\n        \"But deil gang wi' it,\r\n        That I should greet,[6 (12)]\r\n  It'll mak a very decent lum[6 (13)]\r\n  Wi' three threads and a thrum.\"\r\n        Thrum, thrum, thrum, thrum,\r\n        Three threads and a thrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n[_See Note O, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nHUNTING EXPLOITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatching mice is, to a proper-minded cat, a mere parlour pastime, only to\r\nbe resorted to on rainy days, or of a night when too restless to sleep. It\r\nstands to pussy in the same relation that indoor croquet, billiards, or\r\nreading a book in bed does to our noble selves. Rat-catching is only just\r\none degree better, and principally enjoyed by cats who have not reached\r\nmaturity in body and intellect--cats, in fact, in their\r\nhobble-de-hoy-hood. To the matured cat,--especially if highly\r\nbred,--belong all the joys and excitement of the chase a-field. There is\r\nas much difference between the hunting of an animal of the cat-kind and\r\nthat of one of the canine order, as there is between the skilled tactics\r\nof German warfare, and the wild rush to battle of Arab cavalry. There is\r\nmore honesty in the one, more craft and cunning in the other. A dog is\r\nsingularly destitute in what is called in Scotland, \"canniness.\" He also\r\nwants patience; but the cat, armed with this gift, combined with cunning,\r\nand skill gained from experience, is master for anything in the field\r\nwhich she considers game and chooses to square her moustache at. Even to a\r\nhuman being, stalking one's prey is infinitely more engrossing than the\r\nmere hunting of it. The latter is pleasing, certainly, but the former is\r\ncharming. Pussy prefers the charming, while our friend the dog merely runs\r\ndown his prey, and takes little pains to show skill even in that.\r\n\r\nLeaving rats and mice along with blue-bottle flies, in the category of\r\nmere kitten's play, pussy's game-list includes hares, rabbits, stoats,\r\nweasels, water-rats, and moles, besides everything that flies or has\r\nfeathers, from the humble household sparrow to the black-cock of the\r\nmountain. Not before a cat reaches maturity--viz., three years of\r\nage--does the propensity for out-door hunting become a passion with her;\r\nbut once imbued with it, the desire never leaves her as long as she can\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nPirnie is a little female pussy, belonging to a labouring man. At the time\r\nI write, she is over twenty years old; but hale and hearty, and as playful\r\nas a kitten. She is a perfect adept at catching all sorts of vermin, but\r\nmore particularly goes in for mole-catching. When she spies a mole-hill,\r\nshe at once sets herself down to watch it; nor will she raise the siege\r\nfor hours, until the little gentleman in velvet gives signs of his\r\npresence by casting up a few grains of earth. Then is pussy's opportunity.\r\nShe springs nimbly on the bank, and plunges her arms up to the shoulders\r\ninto the earth, and never fails to bring poor molie to bank; and the\r\ndaylight has hardly had time to dazzle his eyes before he is dead.\r\n\r\nLast year Pirnie--being then nineteen years of age--had a thrilling\r\nadventure with a large hare. The hare, which was at least double the size\r\nof pussy, had been enjoying a quiet nap during the heat of the day, in a\r\nfield not far from the house, when Pirnie stumbled across its trail, and\r\non following it up the battle ensued. \"The hare,\" says my informant,\r\n\"fought with great vigour, and often floored her antagonist; but Pirnie\r\nsent in her claws and teeth, till blood flew like rain, and fur like drift\r\n(driven snow); and the hare soon becoming exhausted, Pirnie seized it by\r\nthe throat, and its plaintive screams were presently hushed in death.\"\r\n\r\nGraysie was a tom-cat, and rather famous for his hunting exploits. One\r\nday, Graysie, being on the war-path, encountered a very large weasel, and\r\nit was at once mutually agreed to try conclusions in a fair stand-up\r\nfight. The battle was witnessed by Graysie's owners, and lasted the\r\ngreater part of the afternoon, and ended triumphantly for pussy, in the\r\ndefeat and death of the weasel. When Graysie found out that his fallen foe\r\nwas indeed dead, he took it up in his teeth, and carrying it home,\r\ndeposited it on the front-door steps, intending it no doubt as a present\r\nfor his mistress, as well as a trophy of his own prowess.\r\n\r\nA cat never springs on her prey unless sure of catching it, and her aim\r\nis most unerring. I know a cat that killed over a score of large rats in\r\none day, and on one of these she sprang from a height of no less than\r\ntwelve feet.\r\n\r\nI counted one day no less than 350 mice which a cat had killed\r\nsingle-handed at the removal of a rick of oats in a farmer's yard. He was\r\na fine, noble, red tabby, and it was quite a sight to see the surprising\r\nstrength and agility with which he worked. He killed most of them with his\r\npaws, seldom putting a tooth in one. Every time there was a lull in the\r\nflow of vermin, he took the opportunity of clearing the ground of the\r\nslain, which he carried to a convenient distance and placed all together\r\nin a heap. When all was over, to see honest Tom set himself down in front\r\nof this heap of carnage, and thoughtfully and complacently contemplate his\r\nbloody handiwork, would have been a study for the great Landseer himself.\r\nBut not one of his slain victims did Tom eat. Indeed, high-bred cats\r\nseldom care to eat mice unless they are very hungry; they much prefer\r\nfish to anything else, and the flesh of birds they consider a greater\r\nluxury than even that of rabbits.\r\n\r\nSolomon, or Habakkuk, or Nebuchadnezzar, or some great Hebrew authority,\r\nsays, \"Coneys are a feeble folk.\" Doubtless they were so in those days,\r\nand taken singly so they are in our day; but combinedly they are powerful\r\nindeed, as many a poor ruined farmer can testify. They are very wise too,\r\nand this wisdom is especially displayed in the number of doors they have\r\nin each of their dwellings; so that should an enemy, in the shape of a\r\npussy, or a ferret, pop in at one door, Bunny would just pop out at the\r\nother. I knew a cat in the Isle of Man--she had no tail worth\r\nmentioning--who used to make this very habit of the rabbits a means of\r\nsecuring her prey. She used to enter one hole suddenly, and as suddenly\r\nreappear stern first. Of course, Bunny by this time was scampering off to\r\nthe opposite hole, and there at the door pussy would nab him just as he\r\ncame out.\r\n\r\nCats almost invariably bring home their prey to be either leisurely\r\neaten, given to their kittens, or presented to their owners.\r\n\r\nA man in Banffshire rented a small farm from a game-preserving laird. This\r\nman was ruined by rabbits, and turned out of house and home by them. They\r\nfirst ate up all his oats, his grass, and turnips, so that only potatoes\r\ncould be grown on the place. By-and-by they took to eating the stems of\r\neven those as soon as they appeared above ground, so that all the poor\r\nman's live stock was reduced to one in number, namely, a big tabby cat.\r\nThis cat throve upon the foe. She also took a few youthful prisoners, whom\r\nshe brought home to play with and amuse a fine family of kittens, which\r\nshe had in the cottage garret. These young rabbits lived and grew, and\r\nburrowed and made nests in the thatch. It was the awful row this happy\r\nfamily used to make every night which first led to the discovery. When the\r\nfarmer found out one night the cause of the disturbance, he came down and\r\nawakened his wife and--\r\n\r\n\"Jane,\" said he, and he looked almost sublime as he stood on the cold\r\ndamp floor with a penny candle in one hand, in rather scanty shirt-tails\r\nand red Kilmarnock night cap--he was a study for a Rembrandt, \"Jane, I've\r\nbeen a duffer too long. Those rascally rabbits--they've eaten up\r\neverything we have out of doors, now they've stormed and taken our castle.\r\nBy-and-by they'll eat the bed from under us, then they'll eat ourselves;\r\nbut, Jane, to-morrow morning I'm off,\"--this he said\r\nself-sacrificingly,--\"I'm off, Jane, to the lands of America.\" And the\r\ngood people went, leaving pussy and the feeble folks, in undisputed\r\npossession of house and farm.\r\n\r\nGamekeepers do all they can to destroy the life of poor pussy by setting\r\ntraps for, and shooting her wherever met. But some cats come to know all\r\nabout the treacherous wires and how to avoid them. They know too that\r\nhares and rabbits often fall into these snares, and accordingly they turn\r\nthis knowledge to good account; and when they find a half-strangled animal\r\nin the gin, they quietly despatch, and if possible carry it home.\r\n\r\nCats are great enemies to birds in the breeding season; but it is\r\nsurprising with what terrible fierceness even the smallest birds will\r\ndefend their nests from the inroads of predatory cats, whose evil\r\nintentions are thus often frustrated.\r\n\r\nPussy has many enemies to contend with on the hunting-ground.\r\n\r\nA poacher, the other day, was returning home in the grey light of early\r\nmorning, when he observed a large fox coming in his direction, with what\r\nthe man took to be a hare over his shoulder. The man fired, and Reynard\r\ndropped. His burden was a fine large cat. Poor pussy had been promising\r\nherself a nice plump rabbit for breakfast; the fox thought he should like\r\na fine healthy cat for a change. \"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and\r\nthe lip;\" and the poacher's gun brought matters to quite a different\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nI know a case of a cat that returned from hunting, with two moderate-sized\r\nbut full-grown rats in her mouth, and _both alive_ and staring. They were\r\nno doubt sitting cheek-by-jowl when pussy made the spring.\r\n\r\nIf I tell the reader of a cat that is so clever that she can catch\r\nswallows on the wing, I suppose I may be allowed to close this chapter in\r\npeace. It does seem a little yankee-doodlish I confess, but it is\r\nnevertheless a fact.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of a certain post-master's garden, flows a stream in which his\r\ncat takes many a good salmon-trout. This stream is spanned by an\r\nold-fashioned turf-covered tree-bridge, without any parapet. On this\r\nbridge crouches this sagacious cat, and often secures a swallow, as it\r\nskims out from under. That's all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n[_See Note P, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nCOCK-JOCK AND THE CAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCock-Jock, as he was called, was the most famous of a famous breed of\r\ncocks, our family had possessed for many years. Descended from the\r\nblack-cock of the mountain, with plumage like jet, save one bright spot of\r\ncrimson and gold on each wing, short stout legs, and strongest of spurs,\r\nhe had never met his match in field or pit. Many a brave but unfortunate\r\nbird he had stood upon, and crowed over, as he trampled out its last\r\nbreath. I am speaking of twenty years ago, when cock-fighting in private\r\nwas still a favourite pastime, with many otherwise sensible and honourable\r\nmen, in the far north of Scotland. Cock-Jock possessed in the highest\r\ndegree, all those princely and chivalrous qualities, for which animals of\r\nhis species and breed are so justly celebrated. He was a perfect gentleman\r\nafter his own fashion. He never would touch a morsel of food himself,\r\nuntil every member of his large harem had filled her crop; and thus his\r\nown share was at times small enough. If two hens quarrelled, and had\r\nrecourse to their nebs, he used to peck them both, time about, until they\r\ndesisted; he then gave them a sound rating, pointing out to them in\r\nforcible language, the extreme impropriety of such conduct among ladies of\r\na well-regulated harem. Cock-Jock went to roost every night with his old\r\nmother--how beautiful is filial piety!--on one side of him, and a large\r\nwhite hen, his pet wife, on the other. Then he always crowed at the proper\r\ntime and place; never, under any circumstance, would he mistake moonlight\r\nfor morning, as some foolish brutes do. Dogs he especially disliked. He\r\nused to steal a march upon them, pretend to be busy eating, till he turned\r\ntheir flank, then, before the poor dog could say \"wow,\" he had two inches\r\nof spur in each hip; and that tickled him. He was very affectionate, and\r\ntame enough to eat from your hand; but if you dared to go near or molest\r\na hen, he would assuredly lame you for a month. Once upon a time, when a\r\nlittle bantam cock was sick, Jock never went to roost for weeks, but took\r\nthe bantam to a nest and nursed it under his wings, as a hen would a\r\nchicken, and tenderly fed it daily till it grew well again. I knew a great\r\ndeal of what that cock said, for the language of the lower animals is by\r\nno means difficult to understand. His remarks had reference principally to\r\nhis food, its quantity and quality, his wives--their virtues and vices,\r\nand to his battles. He always backed himself to win. He used to ask every\r\nhuman stranger he met, in a manner not at all calculated to give offence,\r\nif he mightn't have \"just one shy at your shins.\" He one day offered me a\r\nsnail. He came a long distance out of his way too to give it to me. He\r\noffered me the delicious tit-bit with much ceremonious tick-tucking, and\r\nin quite a patronizing manner, as if, like old King Thingummy, I had\r\nadvertised for a new pleasure, and he was about to introduce me to it. I'm\r\nsure I hurt his feelings by refusing it. But I couldn't help it. I think\r\nI could eat a snail now, if hard pushed, although I am told they taste \"a\r\nlittle green.\" But after one has lived on Navy weevils for many years, one\r\nisn't so particular; but I was very young then.\r\n\r\nI remember a gentleman's satin hat being blown off near to his cockship. I\r\nwouldn't have been that hat on any consideration. Heavens! how he battered\r\nit, and tugged at it, and tore it; finally he jumped on it, and crew\r\n_over_ it and _at_ the owner.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty shillings,\" cried that unfortunate, \"thrown to the winds! Curse\r\nthe cock!\"\r\n\r\nJock looked at him, as much as to say, \"Perhaps, sir, you would like to\r\ncome a little nearer, and repeat that expression.\" But the gentleman\r\ndidn't. He preferred going home bare-headed.\r\n\r\nI one day met a poor woman carrying a large stuffed cock. Like the cheeky\r\nbrat they called me, I induced her to come and show the thing to Jock. She\r\ndid so. Jock very soon laid bare the bird-stuffer's art. Cotton-wool and\r\nwires and all went to leeward. Jock had never met with so curious a foe in\r\nhis life before, and he treated him accordingly. My father came. Jock\r\ncrew. The woman wept, and I ran and hid.\r\n\r\nOne fine summer's day my sister left a pillow in the garden. We were all\r\nin the parlour. Presently it came on to snow apparently, and the room got\r\ndarkened. We soon discovered that it was not snow-flakes, but feathers. My\r\nfather said, \"In the name of all creation!\" My mother put on her glasses,\r\nand remarked, \"Every good thing attend us!\" Then we all took umbrellas,\r\nand went out. When, half choked, we reached the garden, we discovered a\r\nclue to the mystery. Cock-Jock had spied the pillow, and could not resist\r\nhaving one kick at it. One kick led to another; and when the eider-down\r\nbegan to come out, Jock lost his temper, and went at it with a will. He\r\nhad some extra animal energy to expend that morning, and he did it--so\r\nsuccessfully, too, that for a whole week never a bit of work was done\r\nabout the place. The horses had a holiday, and we had cold mutton every\r\nday, the servants being all engaged culling the feathers from the grass\r\nand trees, and picking the fluff from the flowers.\r\n\r\nNow to Cock-Jock was granted the honour of walking about wherever he\r\npleased--a privilege which was denied to the members of his harem, and it\r\nwas on the garden walk the battle took place which I am about to describe.\r\nGibbey, my father's famous red Tom-tabby, had a saucer of milk on the\r\nfoot-path, with which, although he did not drink it himself, he did not\r\nchoose that any one else should meddle. The cat and the cock had always\r\nbeen on friendly terms till now; and being thirsty, and presuming on this\r\nfriendship, Cock-Jock walked half-apologetically up to the saucer, and\r\ndipping his beak in to fill it, raised his head to swallow it. It was just\r\nas his eyes were thus turned heavenward, that Master Gibbey sprang up--he\r\nwas always too ready with his hands--and without taking his gloves off,\r\nstruck honest Jock a sound slap on the ear. The cock shook his head; but\r\nknowing he was in the wrong, he did not get angry yet, but attempted to\r\nreason with the cat. For Cock-Jock had this peculiarity: he never lost\r\ntemper at the first blow from any creature he thought he was a match for.\r\nA strange bantam--and we all know how plucky and self-important they\r\nare--once alighted on Jock's dung-hill, and immediately struck at him.\r\n\r\n\"Avast heaving, my little friend,\" said the big cock, or words to that\r\neffect; \"you must be aware that I could knock you into the minutest\r\nsmithereens in the twinkling of a foretop-sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho!\" thought the bantam, \"you're afraid, are you; take one for your nob,\r\nthen,\" and he struck him again.\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all, you know,\" roared Jock, now fairly enraged. He gave the\r\nbantam one blow; and where that bird was sent to has never been\r\nascertained to this day, never a feather of him being found. And so Jock\r\nattempted to reason with the cat.\r\n\r\n\"Cock a ro-ra-kuk? What does this mean, Master Gilbert? I own to having\r\nbeen in the wrong; but a blow, sir--a blow!\"\r\n\r\nHe hadn't long to wait for another either--this time without the gloves;\r\nand then, as the Yankees say, his \"dander riz.\" The cock hopped nimbly\r\nover the saucer, and the battle began in earnest. Cock-Jock \"showered his\r\nblows like wintry rain.\"\r\n\r\nBut pussy adroitly avoided them all, and returned them with such practised\r\nprecision and skill, that the poor cock's pretty head was soon a mass of\r\nblood and gore. Jock, getting confused, held his head ground-wards, as if\r\nfighting with another cock instead of a cat, thus giving Gibbey all the\r\nadvantage. The fight had now lasted fully five minutes, and as yet pussy\r\nrejoiced in a whole skin. I was beginning to think it was all up with the\r\ncock, when, crunch! the advantage came at last,--one stroke with that\r\nmurderous spur, and Gibbey was stretched among the flowers, to all\r\nappearance dead. Cock-Jock bent cautiously down, examined him first with\r\none eye then with another, and then, apparently satisfied, he jumped on\r\nhis side and crew loud and long. But Gibbey did not die. He was out of the\r\nsick-list in four days; but he ever after gave the cock a wide berth, and\r\nplenty of sea-room. Poor Cock-Jock! he died at last on the field of\r\nbattle. His life was literally trodden out of him by a band of hostile\r\nturkeys. Superior weight did it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n[_See Note Q, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nNURSING VAGARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cat, unlike most animals, seems singularly exempt from the pains of\r\nparturition. \"In sorrow shalt thou bring forth,\" was never meant to apply\r\nto pussy. In fact about this time she always appears jollier than at any\r\nother, apparently looking upon the whole business as a capital lark--a\r\nrather enjoyable practical joke. My own cat, Muffie, invariably gives due\r\nnotice of the coming event, by some of the most wonderful specimens of\r\ncantation I ever listened to. In fact she becomes a small opera in\r\nherself, chorus and all. Her song, moreover, is interlarded with little\r\nhysterical squeaks, as if she were brim-full of some strange joy, and\r\nrunning over. At the same time she lavishes more caresses than usual upon\r\nNero, who, not knowing what to make of it, looks very foolish indeed.\r\n\r\nCATS EATING THEIR KITTENS.--Numerous instances might be cited of cats\r\neating their kittens as soon as born. These are curious examples of\r\nmistaken affection, and may be put down to a species of feline mania,\r\nsomewhat analogous to that which is sometimes, though rarely, seen in\r\nhuman beings. Women _enceinte_ have often curious tastes, as witness the\r\nlady whom nothing would please, but a bite of a baker's shoulder. She had\r\nthe bite and was satisfied. We trust the baker was. Or the princess who\r\nhad her husband killed; she ate part of him, and had the remainder salted\r\nfor future consumption. A lady of my acquaintance,--she was a savage, and\r\nlived in Lamoo on the East Coast of Africa,--had twins, a very little baby\r\nboy and a big fat baby girl. I saw her some days after, squatting in front\r\nof her bamboo hut, and singing low to her little son.\r\n\r\n\"But, in the name of goodness,\" said I, \"what have you got in the pot?\r\nFrench missionary?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said; exhibiting no sort of surprise at my question, for a dish\r\nof French missionary was by no means unknown in those parts. And she\r\nintimated to me, that it was _only_ the baby girl, with whom she intended\r\nto feed the little baby boy, as he had not got fair play; and so the\r\nmajesty of justice was maintained.\r\n\r\nCats are greatly sensible of the honour of maternity, and when deprived of\r\ntheir kittens feel very wretched indeed. Under these circumstances, they\r\nwill nurse and suckle almost any creature.\r\n\r\nCATS REARING DOGS.--A cat of mine, a few years ago, suckled and reared a\r\nbeautiful Pomeranian dog. I thought at the time this was rather\r\nsurprising; but I should not be surprised now at anything a cat did.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, the other day, had a very nice fox-terrier bitch. The poor\r\nthing died giving birth to a litter of four puppies. His cat, however,\r\nwhose kittens had been all drowned a day or too before, immediately\r\ninstalled herself in the vacant bed and adopted the puppies. She proved a\r\ngood mother to them, and successfully reared every one of them.\r\n\r\nI know of another similar instance, where a cat was house-mate with a\r\nrather valuable bitch; this bitch brought forth a litter of seven pups.\r\nThe cat had five kittens at the same time. Thinking that seven whelps were\r\nrather many for the bitch to rear, four of pussy's kittens were drowned\r\nand two pups put to her instead. But pussy peremptorily refused to have\r\nanything to say to them, and persisted in that refusal until the expedient\r\nwas tried of drowning the remaining kitten. That brought the cat to her\r\nsenses; and she took to her foster children kindly enough and reared them.\r\nThis same cat afterwards suckled a puppy and kitten at the same time.\r\n\r\nOne day she gave birth to her kittens in an out-house, and at once leaving\r\nthem to shift for themselves, she entered the dwelling house and insisted\r\non giving suck to the dog of her first adoption. As he was now a\r\nfull-grown dog, and had a great regard for his own respectability, he\r\ndidn't see the fun of it. Pussy went after him nevertheless, lying down in\r\nfront of him, and mewing piteously up in his face. When, to get rid of\r\nher importunities, the dog went out, she even followed him to the street,\r\nand only ceased pestering him, when her kittens were discovered and\r\nbrought to her.\r\n\r\nCAT ADOPTING HER GRAND-CHILDREN.--A lady had two cats, mother and\r\ndaughter, living in the same house with her. The mother was of a quiet,\r\ndomesticated turn of mind, and preferred fire-side enjoyments to\r\nout-of-door sports; but the daughter was quite the reverse. She was a\r\nmighty huntress, and it was no uncommon thing, to see her coming waddling\r\nacross the fields with a rabbit as big as herself in her mouth. Both these\r\ncats had kittens at the same time, but the daughter seemed determined,\r\nthat nursing should not interfere with her hunting expeditions. She was a\r\nstrong-minded woman's-rights sort of a cat, and was often scouring the\r\ncountry in pursuit of game, when her poor little family were starving at\r\nhome. One day she went off as usual, and was never afterwards seen alive:\r\nher mangled remains were found a little way down the line, where she had\r\nbeen run over by a railway train.\r\n\r\n\"We were just about,\" says the lady, \"to drown the little orphan kits,\r\nwhen, to our surprise, we found that old grandmamma puss had adopted her\r\nill-fated daughter's children, and was nursing and tending them, with the\r\nsame amount of care and attention she bestowed on her own.\"\r\n\r\nI know an instance where two cats, resident in the same house, had had\r\nkittens on the same day. There being no chance of finding homes for so\r\nmany, they were all drowned with the exception of three. Now these two\r\nmother-cats were wise in their day and generation. No one cat, they\r\nthought, could nurse and suckle ten kits, and it was equally evident that\r\nthree kittens did not require the services of two cats. So they concluded\r\nthat the best plan would be to put the shattered remains of the two\r\nfamilies,--\"Your one kitty, Mrs. Tom, and my two,\"--together in one bed,\r\nand take turn about in nursing them. This was accordingly done, and turned\r\nout to be a very satisfactory arrangement for all parties concerned; for\r\neither cat could now go abroad when she pleased, happy in the thought that\r\nnothing could go wrong at home.\r\n\r\nNURSING A HARE.--A certain carpenter whom I knew had a cat which in due\r\nseason,--as all cats will,--produced a litter of kittens which--very cruel\r\nand thoughtless was the action--were all drowned. Poor pussy mourned her\r\noffspring for many days, but she was a female philosopher--that may seem a\r\nparadox, but she was; so she communed with herself on her bed at night,\r\nthus,--\r\n\r\n\"My inhuman master has most unfeelingly slain all my pretty little babes,\r\nand has not left me one; but he cannot dry up the fountains of a mother's\r\nlove, with which my heart runs o'er; besides, I'm taking the milk-fever.\r\nBut behold, day is gently breaking. I'll seek the mountain, and be it what\r\nit may, I'll have something to love, something to suckle me.\"\r\n\r\nThat day she found, or more probably stole, a fine young hare, which she\r\nnursed and reared as tenderly as if it had been one of her own kittens.\r\n\r\nNURSING SQUIRRELS.--This is by no means uncommon in cats. They will rear\r\nthem either along with their own kittens or by themselves; and a very\r\npretty sight it is to see. Squirrels thus reared make most delightful\r\nlittle pets.\r\n\r\nNURSING CHICKENS.--I know several instances of cats supplying the place of\r\ntheir lost kittens with a chicken. One cat, for example, had had all her\r\noffspring,--it was her first litter,--drowned; she went at once out into\r\nthe court-yard, where a hen was gathering crumbs to a large brood of\r\nchickens. One of these pussy, watching her chance, sprang upon and seized\r\nby the neck, and although hotly pursued by the enraged mother, managed to\r\nreach the house in safety, and went straight to her own bed. Here she\r\ndeposited the chicken, and, lying down beside it, commenced to sing,\r\nclearly intimating that she wished her little adopted one to have a drink.\r\nBut unfortunately, chickie's mouth wasn't adapted for sucking, but it\r\ncowered beside her for warmth; and as there were plenty of crumbs on the\r\nkitchen floor, it did not want. So it became a sort of household pet, and\r\nwhen not eating, it was always cuddling down beside its funny\r\nfoster-mother. I may mention here, that next time this same cat had\r\nkittens they were all drowned again; but this time she did a wiser thing.\r\nShe found out that a cat, belonging to one of the neighbours, was the\r\nhappy mother of three kittens which she had been allowed to keep. Off goes\r\npuss to this neighbour's house, and having thrashed the mother to begin\r\nwith, she kidnapped and carried home one of her family. Several times was\r\nthe kitten taken back, and each time pussy went and stole it again; and as\r\nshe never failed to give the other cat a preliminary hiding, it was at\r\nlast deemed most prudent to let her retain it.\r\n\r\nMiss G---- is an old maid, and a great lover of cats and poultry. Once she\r\nhad a cat nursing a litter of kittens, and one of the chickens in the yard\r\nbeing rather deformed and not thriving, Miss G. brought it and flung it to\r\nthe cat, thinking it would be a great treat to her. It was a treat to\r\nher, though hardly in the way she expected, for pussy commenced licking\r\nit all over, and forthwith adopted it, and nursed it along with her\r\nkittens. She continued to do so until it grew into a large, leggy, and\r\nwithal rather ungainly hen; and the most ridiculous part of the business\r\nwas, that if at any time Tuckie longed for the society of her feathered\r\nfellow-creatures, pussy went after her like a shot, and seizing her by the\r\nneck lugged her back into the house, and jumped with her into Miss G.'s\r\nbed where her kittens were.\r\n\r\nA gentleman in New Deer, also possessed a cat who reared a chicken to\r\nhen-hood. In this case the adopted chicken was nursed alone, pussy's\r\nkittens having been drowned. This fowl's neck, was actually crooked with\r\nthe cat's carrying her about so much in her mouth, so she always held her\r\nhead very much to one side, and was upon the whole a very ugly hen. We\r\nsee, then, that chicken-rearing by cats does not give that amount of\r\nsatisfaction which is desired. It might pay, though, if they could do the\r\nhatching; but cats at present cannot be taught to sit upon eggs. There is\r\nno saying what the future may bring forth, though, for a much more gifted\r\nanimal will be _the coming cat_.\r\n\r\nI think the reader will now be prepared to hear of cats--\r\n\r\nNURSING HEDGEHOGS.--Yes, three of those thorny little things were actually\r\nnursed, suckled, and reared lately by a cat belonging to a gentleman, who\r\nis very fond of trying experiments of this sort. When they grew up, and\r\nwere in good feather, they were very tricky and funny; but pussy soon\r\nfound out that they didn't stand correction well. If she lifted a paw to\r\nthem, pooh! they were transformed into three round prickly balls, before\r\nthe blow fell, and pussy's paw had the worst of it. Then the poor cat\r\nwould look sulkily from one little ball to another, and turning about,\r\nwalk off in disgust. But three pairs of bright beady eyes were keeking at\r\nher from among the thorns; and before she had reached the fender, the\r\nlittle pigs were all unfolded and after her at the galop. Round would\r\nwheel the cat, and up would roll the hogs again, then pussy would seat\r\nherself in front, and keep them thus for an hour at a time, by gently\r\ntapping each ball as it attempted to unroll itself.\r\n\r\nSUCKLING RATS.--Some years ago there was a cat in Scotland who, when three\r\nof her kittens were drowned, supplied their place by bringing in three\r\nyoung rats to make up the number. She must have known something of\r\narithmetic too, for, when one of the little rats died, she went out and\r\ncarried in another, still to have the number five. But still another died,\r\nand probably she could not find any more, for she contented herself with\r\nnursing, and tending the two remaining ones, along with her own two\r\nkittens. I never heard what eventually became of the rats. I don't think\r\nshe would have eaten them. More probably they lived and grew, and went\r\nback as missionaries to their own people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n[_See Note R, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nPUSSY'S PLAYMATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already shown in former chapters, how loving and affectionate pussy\r\nis towards her master and mistress, and how thoughtful and kind a mother\r\nshe is. But to her playmates also she is ever gentle and true, whether\r\nthat playmate be another cat, or an animal of quite a distinct breed. I\r\nhave never known a cat cement a friendship with any creature, without such\r\nfriendship lasting till death. How very wrong then to accuse pussy of\r\nbeing treacherous! With almost any animal that happens to be domesticated\r\nabout the same house, a cat will strike up a friendship, and will be ready\r\nat any time to fight for it, and protect it from harm. It is quite a\r\ncommon thing to see a cat amusing itself playing with rabbits, or guinea\r\npigs, at hide-and-seek among the bushes, or on the lawn. There is often a\r\ndistinct understanding between some old horse or cow about the place. I\r\nhave known a cat live entirely in the stable, and invariably go to sleep\r\non a particular horse's back; the horse in his turn used to welcome her\r\nwith a fond neigh when she came home at night.\r\n\r\nIn a village in the Highlands of Scotland, where I resided, there was a\r\ncrow, a very very old, bald-headed crow, used to come morning and evening,\r\nfor many months, and sit on the fence opposite, until I threw him a slice\r\nof bread or a cold boiled potato. One morning I was surprised on opening\r\nthe door to find the old Bird-o'-freedom, as I called him, standing on the\r\nstep. Instead of flying away, he hopped past me into the room, and\r\nperching himself on the fender, looked so knowingly first at me and then\r\nat the fire, that for the life of me I could not help thinking about Poe's\r\nraven and shuddering, fully expecting the bird would presently say,\r\n\"Nevermore.\" If he could have spoken, I am sure he would have addressed me\r\nsomething after this fashion:--\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, you're something of an animal fancier, and I know you're not a\r\nbad-hearted chap on the whole. Now the fact is, I'm feeling rather poorly,\r\nand the forest winds are cold of a night; besides, I'm not so young as I\r\nhave been,--I'm nigh on ninety, lad,--so I intend for my few remaining\r\ndays to take my pick in a homely way at your fireside. The cat won't bite,\r\nwill she?\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, Muffie had fully made up her mind to turn him out of doors there\r\nand then, and with that hospitable intention was now approaching him. But\r\nBird-o'-freedom opened his mouth, and gave vent to two such caws, as\r\nnearly shook the house. I never heard any bird have such lungs. Muffie was\r\nfairly startled, and scampered off with her tail in the air; but in a few\r\ndays the cat and he were as thick as thieves. In truth, Bird-o'-freedom\r\nwas a thief, at least, as far as eggs went. If he spied one in the\r\ncupboard, he watched his chance, and when it came, one dig laid the egg\r\nopen, and next second the contents were down his throat with one almighty\r\ngulp. I allowed him two eggs a day, but he would not take them if I\r\noffered them to him, or before my face; I had to lay them one by one in\r\nthe cupboard, and give him the pleasure of stealing them. Muffie was never\r\nbetter pleased than when he was eating, and she sat and sang to him while\r\nhe drank the milk from her saucer. Then she would sit and sleep cheek by\r\njowl with him for hours. A cat with whom Muffie had never had any words\r\nbefore, once looked into the room, Muffie drove her out with terrible\r\nsuddenness, and thrashed her properly outside the door. When the candles\r\nwere lit in the long winter evenings, Bird-o'-freedom, perched upon the\r\nfender, used to look up at me so slyly, and yet so solemnly with one\r\nwicked eye, that I used to doubt whether he wasn't the devil entirely, and\r\nfly to my fiddle to dispel the thoughts. The poor crow had a fit one\r\nmorning, and died on his back on the hearth-rug; and when he was dead, the\r\ncat was chief mourner. She went about for days, searching for her lost\r\nfavourite, and mourning all the while, for her grief was really sincere.\r\n\r\n\"Tabby,\" writes a lady to me, \"had been poisoned. Shortly before her\r\ndeath, we had her brought upstairs and laid down on the rug in front of\r\nthe fire,--she was very ill, and unable to lift her head. Tom came\r\nbouncing as usual into the room, and sitting down beside her, with his paw\r\nplayfully patted her on the face; but getting no response, it actually\r\nthen seemed as if he understood how serious the case really was, because\r\nwith the same paw he gently raised her head up a little, and kindly licked\r\nher all over. It was very affecting, and was more than we expected from\r\nhim; but certainly he got great credit for the good deed, and ever after\r\nhad the character of being the warmest-hearted of cats,--and poor Tabby\r\ndied in his arms.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one knows what a warm friendship will often spring up between a cat\r\nand a dog, both resident in the same house. How they will sleep in each\r\nother's arms, eat together, fight for one another; how generous the dog is\r\ntowards any weaknesses she may display; and how grateful pussy is in\r\nreturn. They will have their little tiffs occasionally, of course. I have\r\nseen my cat jump on the piano-stool more than once, in order to slap\r\nMaster Nero in the face; upon which the dog, swearing like the British in\r\nFlanders, hauled her off, and rubbed her well on the carpet, but did not\r\nreally hurt her.\r\n\r\nTHE CZAR AND WHISKEY.--Whiskey in this case does not mean something to\r\ndrink. It was the name--and a very appropriate name it was--of a little\r\nScotch terrier, who lived in a village in the far north of Scotland. In\r\nthe same house with him dwelt the Czar,--this was a large bluish-black\r\ncat, who was said to have been imported from Russia--hence his name. No\r\ntwo animals in the world could have loved each other more devotedly, than\r\ndid the Czar and little Whiskey. And Whiskey was the gamest of the game,\r\nyet he never showed his teeth to his feline friend. From the same dish\r\nthey took their meals, Whiskey merely premising that he should have all\r\nthe bones. They were together all day, save when Whiskey's duty to his\r\nmaster called him away, and at night they shared the same couch, the Czar\r\nfondly taking Whiskey in his arms because he was the biggest. I'm not\r\nsure, indeed, whether the Czar did not waken Whiskey, when that little\r\ngentleman took the nightmare. However, they were as loving as loving could\r\nbe. And, once or twice every week, this kindly couple used to go out\r\nhunting together. They did not care for game-laws, and heeded not the\r\nkeepers--they were a law unto themselves. On these occasions, they used to\r\ngo out together in the morning, and after spending all the long day among\r\nthe hills and woods, they invariably came home before dark. This coming\r\nhome before nightfall, was doubtless a suggestion of Whiskey's, for a dog\r\ncan neither see so well in the dark as a cat, nor can his constitution so\r\nwell withstand the dews of night. But the very fact of the Czar's keeping\r\nearly hours to please Whiskey, is another proof of how he loved him. And\r\nalmost every night, these sons of Nimrod brought home with them some\r\ntrophy from the hunting-ground. Sometimes it was a rabbit, more often a\r\nbird--if the latter, Whiskey generally had the honour of carrying it, and\r\nvery proud he was of the distinction; if a rabbit, the Czar bore the\r\nburden. And so things went on, till one mournful night, poor Whiskey came\r\nhome later than usual, and all alone. He came in, but lay down on the\r\ndoor-mat, out of which he would not budge an inch. He refused his porridge\r\nand all consolation, and lay there in a listening attitude, starting up\r\nevery minute at the slightest sound. His mistress went to bed and left\r\nhim. It must have been long past midnight, when Whiskey came dashing into\r\nhis mistress's bedroom, knocking over a chair in his hurry, and barking\r\nwildly as he dashed hither and thither, like a mad thing. When his\r\nmistress got up at last, poor little Whiskey preceded her to the door,\r\nbarking and looking very anxious and excited. A pitiful mew was heard, and\r\non the lady opening the door, in rushed Czar the cat on three legs--he had\r\nleft the other in a trap. Nothing could exceed the kindness of Whiskey to\r\nhis wounded playmate. He threw himself down beside her on the rug whining\r\nand crying with grief, and gently licked her bleeding stump. And every\r\nday for weeks did Whiskey apply hot fomentations, with his soft wee tongue\r\nto pussy's leg, till it was entirely healed. But they had no more romping\r\ntogether in the fields and woods, for the Czar's hunting-days were\r\nover--in this world at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n[_See Note S, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nPUSSY AND THE HARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the parish of P----, Aberdeenshire, there lived some years ago a\r\ncrofter and his wife, and a little boy their only son. A fine she-tabby\r\ncat who nightly sang duets with the kettle to welcome the master home, was\r\nthe only other member of the family.\r\n\r\nOne day, while roaming over the moorland in search of birds' nests, the\r\nboy found a young hare, sound asleep among the heather. Such a prize was\r\nworth any number of birds' eggs, and the lad carried it tenderly home and\r\npresented it to his mother, and it was that night placed in a box in the\r\ncow-byre. Next morning it was gone--puss had eaten it no doubt, and no one\r\ncould blame her. Pussy had had kittens, only a day or two before, and they\r\nhad all been drowned. For about a week after the disappearance of the\r\nhare, it was observed, that pussy was not so regular in her attendance on\r\nthe house as usual. She never lay by the fire--the kettle might sing its\r\nduets by itself; she ate her meals hurriedly and greedily, and then\r\nescaped out.\r\n\r\n\"It's the hare she ate that's no agreeing wi' her,\" said the goodman.\r\n\"There's mair in it than that,\" said the canny goodwife; and, with a\r\nwoman's instinct, she followed pussy out and up into the hay-loft; and, lo\r\nand behold! there lay the cat, in a snug little bed, suckling the lost\r\nhare, and singing as sweetly as a linnet. Pussy reared the hare, and they\r\nbecame inseparables. At breakfast pussy always waited until the hare had\r\nfinished, and when there happened to be broth for dinner--a dish the hare\r\ndid not relish--the cat never failed to beg for a piece of bread, which\r\nshe carried at once to her strange foster-child. The cat and hare went\r\neverywhere together; sometimes indeed they might be seen fully a mile from\r\nhome. This cat was a famous hunter, and always brought her dead rabbits\r\nhome. It was funny, at times, to see the pair coming from the fields at\r\neven, the cat with her dead quarry in her mouth, creeping stealthily\r\nalong, her eyes in every direction, and the big hare, rather out of\r\nbreath, bringing up the rear, and looking very foolish, as if he didn't\r\nexactly know what it all meant, and rather deprecated the cat's conduct\r\nthan otherwise. This cat could fish; for one day a gentleman hooked a\r\nlarge salmon in the river, and after running it for nearly two hours his\r\nline broke and he lost it. Now, this salmon was found next morning on the\r\ncottar's door-step. The cat and hare were both present; and as there is no\r\naccount on record of hares fishing, we think the credit of the capture\r\nmust be given to pussy. For two years this strangely matched couple were\r\nfriends, and bosom companions, for they slept together. But, one fine\r\nsummer's day they were lying in front of the house half-asleep in the\r\nsunshine,--the hare at one side of the door, pussy at the other, and the\r\ncottar's wife knitting between them.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene was one \"of peas,\" and might have remained so, only\r\ntragedy, in the shape of farmer Dick's big, disreputable collie, was at\r\nthat precise moment peeping round a corner and taking stock.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" said the dog to himself; \"it's a--no, it isn't; yes, it is; hang\r\nme, if it isn't--_a hare_--as cheeky as you like too. I'll teach him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he did. The poor hare never required another lesson. Nor did pussy\r\nlose any time in giving the dog one. Rendered frantic by her poor friend's\r\ndeath, she sprang on his back and tore him with tooth and nail. One of the\r\ndog's eyes was entirely destroyed; and it need not be added he ever after\r\ngave that house a wide berth. After the untimely fate of her foster-child,\r\npussy was extremely disconsolate, moping about and never caring to leave\r\nthe house. She had not long to mourn for him however, for some months\r\nafter she fell a victim to her own curiosity; for, like women, cats are\r\nextremely prying.\r\n\r\nThe cottar's wife was one day melting some tallow in a large tea-pot,\r\nwhich after using she left by the fire-side; and that night, when every\r\none was in bed, pussy, who had been dying all day to know what was inside\r\nthat tea-pot, \"pirled\" off the lid and popped her imprudent head in. Alas!\r\nshe never got it out again. About midnight the honest couple--snug in\r\nbed--were awakened by a dreadful clattering noise in the kitchen, along\r\nthe passage, and on the stair.\r\n\r\n\"Geordie, Geordie! rise and see,\" said the good wife, nudging her goodman.\r\n\r\n\"Jean, Jean! rise and see yersel',\" said he, nudging her in turn.\r\n\r\n\"It's _Hallow E'en_, Geordie,\" cried Jean; \"and there is a deil, or\r\n_deils_ rather, in the house, I ken.\" For the reader must bear in mind\r\nthat, though banished from English soil, fairies, bogles, and all that\r\nilk, still linger among the breckans of our Scottish glades and glens; and\r\nannually on the night of 31st October, they play a thousand pranks under\r\nthe direct supervision of the archfiend himself. This superstition proved\r\nfatal to poor puss. Gradually the noise got less, and soon ceased\r\nentirely. Next morning, the cottar's wife was up betimes and downstairs.\r\nShe soon returned, wringing her hands and weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Geordie,\" she cried; \"come doon and see what the deil has done to our\r\npoor pussy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n[_See Note T, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nTHE MILLER'S FRIEND--A TALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might have travelled many a long summer's day and not met with such\r\nanother. The very look of him was enough to dispel all ideas of hunger: he\r\nwas so big and so stout, yet withal so rosy and hardy. His voice had a\r\ncheery ring with it, which, combined with the merry twinkle in his eye,\r\nset you on good terms with yourself at once, if indeed it did not make you\r\nlaugh outright. As for _his_ laugh, to hear it once was to remember it for\r\never. It was hearty, it was musical; in pitch something between the _Ha!\r\nha! ha!_ and the HO! HO! HO! and it rang through the old mill, wakening a\r\ndozen sleeping echoes, and causing the old bulldog to bark, although that\r\nquadruped had to lean against a pillar to perform the feat. The miller\r\nwasn't a young man by any means; but though he had no wife, he was the\r\njolliest widower ever you saw, albeit his hair and whiskers were like the\r\npowdery snow. But his voice--ay, that was the bit--you should have heard\r\nit rising in song-snatches, and rolling high over the double bass of the\r\ngrinding wheels and the shrill clack-clack of that merry old mill.\r\n\r\nHe was honest moreover. No one in the parish had ever been heard to accuse\r\nhim of giving light weight, or adding sand to the meal to make it turn the\r\nscale sooner. And, as a matter of course, he was a general favourite,\r\nespecially among the farmer's daughters and servant-maids; so much so\r\nindeed, that all round the country it became the general custom to take\r\nmeal by the stone, instead of by the bushel, that the \"errands to the\r\nmill\" might be all the more frequent. And indeed, however dull a lass\r\nmight be, when she was going to the mill, she never left it without a\r\nrosier blush on her bonnie cheek, and a smile playing around her lips, as\r\nshe trundled cheerily along with her bag upon her head. Yes, indeed, had\r\nhe wanted a wife, the miller might have married the youngest of them all.\r\nSuch was the miller, and such too were the race he sprang from,--they were\r\nin the habit of getting young again, just at the age that other folks\r\nbegan to get old. They were in their prime at eighty, and never thought of\r\ndeparting this life, until the dial shadow of their existence began to\r\ncreep near the hundred. Then all at once it used to strike Old Death, that\r\nhe had forgotten all about them, so he would lift his scythe, and cut them\r\ndown smartly and suddenly.\r\n\r\nAnd as the miller was jolly, so everything about that old mill was jolly\r\ntoo. There was music in the mill-lead as the waters leapt joyously from\r\nunder the sluice, and hurried along to their task, and the great wheel\r\nitself, as it turned slowly and steadily round, seemed actually bursting\r\nwith suppressed merriment. Then you should have seen the sweet little bit\r\nof scenery the mill was set down in. Ah! English tourists have yet to\r\nlearn, that there is one part of Scotland yet unhackneyed, yet\r\nuncockneyed, yet unspoiled, but still romantic enough to repay a journey\r\nfrom London-town. The mill was built by the banks of the wimpling\r\nDon,--built in a dingle, green rolling braes sloping up at one side, steep\r\nrocks on the other, and the river, here broad and fordable, rippling\r\nbetween. On the top of the rocks waved a tall pine forest; some of the\r\ntrees hung by their roots over the cliff just as the storm had left them.\r\n'Twas sweet in summertime to hear the birds singing in that forest, or to\r\nsee the crimson glow of sunset glimmering through the branches; but how\r\ntall and dark and weirdly looked those trees, as they stretched their\r\nbranches up into the green frosty sky of a quiet winter's gloaming.\r\n\r\nTo my friend the miller this wood had an especial attraction, for within\r\nits shade he had wooed his first, his early love. If you had scaled the\r\nlittle foot-path, that struggled up through the rocks, at the place where\r\nthey were less precipitous, and finally gained the cliff, just at the\r\npoint where Snuffie Sandy tumbled over in the dark and broke his neck, you\r\nwould have come to a little foot-path, that went windingly away among the\r\ntall solemn Scotch pines, to the roots of which the sun never penetrated\r\neven at noon, and whose massive trunks might have been mistaken in the\r\nsombre light, for the pillars in some gigantic cavern. Onward for a\r\nquarter of an hour, and you would suddenly have found yourself in a\r\nclearing in the midst of the forest. This clearing was fully a square mile\r\nin extent, and was tastefully laid out as a little farm, neat cottage and\r\ngarden, barnyard, field, and fence, and all complete, as snug a little\r\nplace as you could wish to see. Owing to its situation, there was quite an\r\nunderstanding between the domestic animals, and the denizens of the\r\nsurrounding wood. In summertime the hare and the rabbit, browsed\r\npeacefully beside the cows and the sheep; the birds came regularly to the\r\nlatter for a supply of wool to line their nests; the hens and ducks\r\nshared their oats amicably with the wild pigeons; and old Dobbin the\r\nhorse, who used to be tethered among the clover, didn't mind the crows a\r\nbit: they used his back as a sort of moving hustings on which to debate\r\npolitics or have an occasional stand-up fight, and when Dobbin lay down to\r\nrest they lovingly picked his teeth. And everything immediately around the\r\ncottage, was as natty and neat as the little farm itself. The greenest of\r\ngarden gates led you into the sprucest of little gardens; the box was\r\nneatly trimmed; never a blade of grass grew on the gravel; and although\r\nthere were not many flowers, it did one's heart good in early spring to\r\nsee the blue and yellow crocuses, peeping through the dun earth, and the\r\nsweet-scented primrose discs, diamonded with dew, reclining on the\r\ndelicate green of their tender leaves. There was a rustic porch around the\r\ncottage door; it was formed of the unbarked stems of the spruce fir-tree,\r\nwith just an inch of branch left on for effect, and the door itself\r\nboasted of a brass knocker, bright enough to shave at; and had you knocked\r\nand been invited \"ben\" to the best-parlour, you would have found\r\neverything there too both trig and trim. There was nothing either on the\r\nmantle-piece or on the walls to offend your feelings. There were no\r\nhideous ornaments or foxy lithographs, but shells, and grass, and moss,\r\nand a few modest engravings and photo's of friends. Instead of a\r\nchiffonier there was a neat chest of drawers, and instead of a piano a\r\nspinning-wheel. At this latter, Nannie, when not milking or attending to\r\nhousehold matters, sat birring all day long, making music which, if not\r\noperatic, was at least natural, and suited Nannie and pleased the cat to a\r\nnicety. Nannie of course was the presiding goddess of the cottage and\r\nfarm. The place was all her own. She kept a man and a laddie to do the\r\nout-work, and a tidy bit of a girl to assist her in-doors. Nannie from all\r\naccounts must have been alarmingly near forty, though she looked a full\r\ndozen of years younger, and beautiful for even that age,--beautiful in\r\nregularity of features, in just sufficient colour, and in a lack of all\r\ncoarseness. Taking her, figure and all combined, you would have said that,\r\nif not a lady, she was at least born to adorn a higher sphere. She had\r\nnever been married, but didn't look an old maid by any means. For Nannie\r\nhad had her little history. And merry and cheerful as she always was\r\nduring the day, still, when the day's duties were over, and she had\r\nretired to her little chamber, after she had read her chapter and psalm\r\nand sat down to muse, there would come a strange sad look in her eyes, and\r\nat times a tear stood there, as she took from her pocket a portrait and a\r\nlock of dark brown hair. And that portrait on which she grazed so fondly,\r\nalthough the face was younger, was the miller's; his, too, though\r\ndifferent in colour, that lock of hair tied with blue, that seemed to\r\ncling caressingly around poor Nannie's finger. For the miller and she had\r\nloved each other all their lives long. Oh! their story is quite a common\r\none,--a lover's quarrel, a harsh word, and a silent parting: that was all.\r\nAnd the miller had gone off in a pet, and married a woman double his age.\r\nThe marriage was as uncongenial as snow in summer; but now, though his\r\nwife had been long in her grave, the miller, though he knew he could get\r\nforgiveness at once from Nannie, never went to ask it, feeling he had\r\nerred too deeply to deserve it. So they had lived for years--those two\r\nloving hearts--with only the dark pine forest and the broad river between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne dark Christmas morning the miller was astir long before his usual\r\ntime, for there was more to do than he could well manage. There was barley\r\nto prepare for Christmas broth, and meal for Christmas brose; so long\r\nbefore the sun had dreamt of getting out of bed, he had hauled up the\r\nsluice. The waters rushed headlong on towards the great mill-wheel; the\r\ngreat mill-wheel turned slowly round; and suddenly the old mill,\r\npreviously as silent and dark as the grave itself, became instinct with\r\nlife and sound.\r\n\r\nIt was a good quarter of a mile walk, from the mill-dam sluice to the\r\nmill. Hundreds of times he had gone the road before, but on this\r\nparticular morning, somehow or other, the miller felt peculiarly nervous.\r\nIt was so dark, and everything was so still, and being Christmas morning,\r\nwhat more likely than that he should see a ghost. He tried to sing, but\r\nfor once in his life he failed; and he felt quite a sense of relief when\r\nthe farmer's cocks awoke, and began hallooing to each other all over the\r\ncountry. So, in no enviable frame of mind, he reached the mill and opened\r\nthe door. The old dog came to meet him, and he struck a light, and shaking\r\noff for a time his superstitious fears, he donned a dusty coat, and set to\r\nwork in earnest. First there was the corn to spread upon the kiln. That\r\ndone, he went below to put a match to the kiln-fire which was already\r\nlaid. In this furnace it was not coals that were burned, nor wood either,\r\nbut the outside husks of the oats themselves,--what are called in Scotland\r\n\"shealings.\" This made a roaring fire, and was easily lit. All was\r\ndarkness when the miller went down, but he soon had both light and heat.\r\nIndeed, from the latter he was fain to stand back; and so, leaning on his\r\nshovel, as he contemplated his work, with the firelight playing around his\r\nhandsome face and figure and the darkness behind him, he would have formed\r\nno mean study for a painter. But suddenly the spade dropped from his\r\ngrasp, his face turned pale,--pale as it never would be again until death\r\nset his seal on it,--and the perspiration stood in big drops on his brow,\r\nwhile his frightened gaze was riveted on the furnace before him. He had\r\nseen _a face in the fire_, apparently that of a demon--what else could it\r\nbe?--black and unearthly looking, with white teeth and green glaring eyes;\r\nit showed but a moment, and disappeared again in the smoke beneath the\r\nkiln. For a few seconds which seemed like ages, he stood there transfixed;\r\nthen again that awful face in the blaze, and this time a horrid yell which\r\nseemed to rend the very mill; and something sprang wildly from the\r\nfurnace,--sprung at him, over him, through him, somehow or anyhow, the\r\nmiller could not tell,--he had tumbled down in a dead faint. Daylight was\r\njust coming in when he awoke. The fire was black out, and the mill still\r\ngrinding away at nothing in particular. Outside, the snow lay on the\r\nground to a depth of several inches; it was no wonder then that the poor\r\nmiller began to shiver, as soon as he gathered himself up. He\r\nshivered,--and when he thought of that terrible apparition, he shuddered\r\nas well as shivered.\r\n\r\n\"An awfu' visitation,\" he muttered to himself,--\"a truly awfu' visitation\r\non a Christmas morning;\" and he began to wonder what he had ever done to\r\ndeserve it. He went over his whole life,--honest man, it had been anything\r\nbut a chequered or eventful one,--and finally came to the conclusion that\r\nit must be a judgment on him for forsaking his early love.\r\n\r\n\"Poor lonely Nannie!\" he sighed, as he dragged himself wearily away to\r\nbegin his work.\r\n\r\nThe miller was a steady, sober man, but he did feel glad when visitors\r\nbegan to arrive at the mill, and being Christmas morning, bring a bottle\r\nwith them. But he could not find exhilaration in the whisky,--no, nor\r\nconsolation either. He simply could not get warm, only his face seemed to\r\nglow; and there was a weight at his heart, as if he had swallowed one of\r\nhis own millstones. When at last the day wore over, and he found himself\r\nat home, he thought he had never felt so tired in his life before. His\r\ndecent old body of a housekeeper marked how ill he looked, and insisted on\r\nputting him to bed at once, with a bottle of hot water, an extra blanket,\r\nand a basin of gruel.\r\n\r\nNext day the miller was in a raging fever, and for many weeks he seemed\r\nonly hovering between life and death. Mrs. Fowler, as his housekeeper was\r\ncalled, could not have been more kind to him if he had been her own son.\r\nBut one day she said to herself, as she looked upon his poor worn face, \"I\r\nsee I canna cure him, and the man will die if assistance doesna come soon.\r\nI'll try it,--I'll try it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the trying it had reference to we shall soon see. Mrs. Fowler put on\r\nher Sunday's gown and bonnet, put on her scarlet shawl and her sable boa,\r\nand telling the miller she would soon return, went out into the keen\r\nJanuary air, and took her way to the bridge that spanned the rapid Don.\r\nFor the good lady was far too old to try the ford, or climb the rocks, or\r\ntrust herself in the dark little footpath, that led through the forest to\r\nNannie's house. She arrived there in good time for all that.\r\n\r\nNannie was spinning, but strange to say, she was always glad to see Mrs.\r\nFowler. So she put aside the reel and bustled about to get tea ready.\r\n\r\n\"And is he getting any better?\" asked Nannie at length, referring to the\r\nmiller. The question was asked in seemingly a half-careless tone, but none\r\nknew but herself, how her heart was beating all the while.\r\n\r\n\"Na, na, poor man,\" said Janet, for that was her maiden name, \"he is no\r\nlong for this world.\"\r\n\r\nNannie had turned away her head, and buried her face in her hands.\r\nPresently she was sobbing like a child. Janet spoke not.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried poor Nannie, \"I must, I _shall_ see him before he dies.\"\r\n\r\nThen Janet spoke.\r\n\r\n\"And God in heaven bless you, my bonnie bairn, for those words; for you're\r\nthe only one in this weary world that can save his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--but,\" said Nannie, \"if he really is going to live, you\r\nknow,--I--a--\"\r\n\r\nOh the inconsistency of women! A moment before, and she would have given\r\nall she possessed in the world for one glance of the loved face; now,\r\nbecause he was going to live,--oh, dear!\r\n\r\nBut Janet hastened to tell her all the story,--how in his wild delirium he\r\nhad spoke of no one, raved of no one, save her; and now that the fever had\r\nsubsided and left him weak as a baby, how he always led the subject on to\r\nNannie, his early love, their rambles in the pine-forest, and his cruel\r\ndesertion of her, and how he always wound up with the melancholy\r\nreflection, that he knew poor Nannie would forgive him when she saw him\r\nbeing carried to his \"lang hame.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so well did Janet represent the whole matter and argue her case, that\r\nNannie gave her consent to go along with her even then. And she laughed\r\nand cried at the same time, in quite a hysterical way, as she said,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mistress Fowler,--he! he! he!--you know best and--he! he!--if you\r\nreally think it will do the poor man good, I'll go; and--but--oh! Mistress\r\nFowler, I _must_ have a cry.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she did.\r\n\r\nAnd it really seemed to do her good; for she smiled quite calm and\r\nhappy-like afterwards--the heightened flush in her cheeks making her look\r\nten times prettier; and she was soon dressed and ready to march.\r\n\r\nJust as she was going out, however, her countenance fell, and,--\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Mistress Fowler, my poor cat,\" cried Nannie.\r\n\r\n\"Your cat?\" said Janet.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, woman, my cat,\" replied Nannie; \"come and see the poor darling.\r\nSomehow or other it got dreadfully burnt, about three weeks ago, and it\r\nisn't better yet; come and see.\"\r\n\r\n\"That a cat!\" said Janet with uplifted hands and eyes; \"dearie me! dearie\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nIn good sooth it might have been taken for a kangaroo, or anything else\r\nyou liked. There wasn't a hair on its whole body; and although the wounds\r\nand scars were healed, it was still in a state of prostration and\r\ndebility. It purred kindly, however, when its mistress gently stroked it,\r\nshowing how fully it appreciated her kindness. * * *\r\n\r\n\"You'll even take the poor thing wi' you, Nannie,\" said old Janet.\r\n\r\n\"Three whole hours,\" said the miller to himself as he lay in bed and\r\nlooked up at the old-fashioned eight-day clock, whose melancholy ticking\r\nhad been his only solace since Janet left,--\"three whole hours, and she\r\npromised she would be back in one.\" Presently big flakes of snow began to\r\nfall slowly ground-wards, and the poor man's spirits seemed to fall along\r\nwith them. It was so gloomy being all alone in the still house; the very\r\nfire had forsaken him; and he shivered as he gazed out into the fast\r\nclosing winter's day. He remembered how different had been his feelings\r\none evening, long, long ago, when he had stood with her by his side,\r\nlooking upwards through the maze of snow-flakes,--how they had crept\r\ncloser together from the cold, and sworn to be for ever near each other.\r\nAh, that lost love! He was sure he was dying, even now; and how dreadful\r\nhe thought it was to die all alone. He wondered if _she_ would feel sorry,\r\nwhen she heard of his death. And then he slept--a nasty fitful starting\r\nsleep, with painful racking dreams; now he was climbing interminable\r\nprecipices, every moment ready to fall; now he was walking over long\r\ntrackless moors that would never, never have an end; and now he was\r\ntoiling at the mill with wheels, wheels all around him, and horrid shapes\r\nwith brown skinny arms, that tried to clutch and pull him down among the\r\ndark grinding machinery; then he screamed, or tried to scream, and at once\r\nhis dream took another form. He seemed to be lying in his own room, and\r\ncould hear the ticking of the old clock; but it was no longer dark and\r\ndismal, the blinds were drawn, the lamp was lit, a cheerful fire burned\r\non the clean-swept hearth, and the kettle sang on the hob, and--ah,\r\nblissful vision! there, beside the bed, sat Nannie,--his Nannie, as he had\r\nseen her years and years ago; a bright blush was on her cheek, and her\r\nbonnie eyes were bent on his face with so sad a look. The miller held his\r\nbreath, lest the vision should vanish into darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh!\" cried poor Nannie, \"he doesn't know me, he doesn't know me;\" and\r\nshe hid her face on his breast and sobbed aloud. _Now_ he knew it was no\r\ndream. He stretched out his arms, but it had all come so suddenly,\r\neverything seemed to swim before his eyes, and his head sank like lead on\r\nthe pillow. He had fainted.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes again, it was only to meet once more Nannie's\r\nloving anxious gaze; he could only smile as he pressed her hand, and fell\r\ninto a sleep, sweeter than he had slept since childhood.\r\n\r\nWell may the poet call sleep \"Nature's sweet restorer.\" But there is\r\nsomething more important than even sleep itself, and without which,\r\nrefreshing sleep can never come--happiness and contentment. Psychics, or\r\nmental treatment, is not now overlooked by medical men as it used to be;\r\nand if ever the philosopher's stone, or the secret of making men immortal,\r\nbe found, it will be through this science.\r\n\r\nIt was far into the middle of next day, before the miller awoke. He felt a\r\nsensation of happiness at his heart even before he opened his eyes, or\r\nremembered the cause. The cause indeed was just then busy getting ready\r\nhis breakfast. It was a clear frosty day outside, with the sky ever so\r\nbright and blue, and the whole landscape white with dry powdery snow; and\r\ninside everything was as neat as new pins. How pretty and home-like Nannie\r\nlooked, bustling about with her peachy cheeks and her nut-brown hair. It\r\nwas quite refreshing to look at her,--at least so the miller thought; and\r\nhe gave a big double-shuffle sigh, like what a child does when it is just\r\nfinishing a good cry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you're awake, are you?\" said Nannie, going to the bedside, and taking\r\nhis hot hand between her cold little palms.\r\n\r\n\"I've been keeking at you from under the coverlit for mair than an hour,\"\r\nsaid the miller, honestly.\r\n\r\n\"And what made ye come, Nannie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard you were dying, John.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! bless you, bless you, poor lassie; it is mair than kind,--it's what\r\nonly an angel would do. But if ye knew what I've suffered a' these lang\r\nlang years,--\"\r\n\r\n\"I do know, John; Janet has told me everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"And bye-gones are bye-gones; and I'm forgiven?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bye-gones are bye-gones, John; and you're forgiven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nannie,\" said the miller, emphatically, \"that wee deevilock (imp) that\r\nlap oot at me through the kiln-fire was a saint, I'll be sworn.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's here,\" said Nannie.\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\" said John, somewhat nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" continued Nannie; and she held up the cat which had been sleeping\r\ncosily at the miller's feet all the night.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! dear me!\" said the invalid. \"Well, well; and the deevilock was\r\na cat--your cat--after all. Well, Nannie, it's no bonnie; but, Lord bless\r\nit, give me it, till I take it into my bosom.\"\r\n\r\nPussy, purring, was duly deposited under the bed-clothes; and then Nannie\r\nenjoined her patient not to talk any more. \"But,\" she added, \"you do feel\r\nbetter; don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better! Nannie,\" quo' John; \"if I had any mortal thing on besides my\r\nsark, I would rise this vera minute, and dance the reel o' Bogie.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a treat to John to see Nannie infusing the tea in Janet's best\r\nbrown-stone,--it was a treat to see her kneeling there, making the toast\r\nand then putting on the butter, and crushing the hard edges with the\r\nknife, and seaming it across and across, that the butter might find its\r\nway to the interior; and it was a treat to see the way she placed the\r\nlittle table at his pillow-side, and spread a clean white towel over the\r\ntray, that held the plates for the toast, and the pot with the fragrant\r\ntea. But when she placed her own cup on the same tray, and sat down\r\nbeside him, John was indeed a happy man; and scarcely a mouthful could he\r\nswallow for looking at her, although she had cut the tender juicy steak\r\ninto the most tempting tiny morsels that ever were seen.\r\n\r\nNow although the miller began to revive, from the very day that Nannie\r\nfirst became his gentle nurse, still he had a hard tussle for his life;\r\nand the winter's snow had melted, the ploughed fields--dotted here and\r\nthere with sacks of golden grain--were changing from black to brown in the\r\nspring sunshine, ere, leaning on Nannie's arm, he could take even a short\r\nwalk. It was wonderful, though, the amount of good even that first little\r\nouting did him. It seemed to put new life into his veins, to see the buds\r\ncoming out on the trees, the grass turning green, and the sturdy farmers\r\nbusy scattering the corn, with the reverend-looking rooks in swallowtail\r\ncoats, religiously following at their heels. Oh! bless you, it was the\r\nworms, not the grain, they were gobbling up. To the upper moorland the\r\npeewits had returned, and the curlew was mingling his shrill scream with\r\ntheir laughing voices; and of course there was the lark up yonder in\r\nheaven's blue, all a-quiver with song, and ever and anon cocking his head,\r\nand giving another look down, to see if that hussy of a hen of his--who\r\ncouldn't sing a stave to save her life--was duly appreciating his efforts\r\nto amuse her. Well, then, if I tell you that the soft spring-wind was\r\nblowing balmily from the south-west,--as properly educated spring-winds\r\nalways ought to, and do blow,--you will not marvel that, when the miller\r\nat last sought the house, there was a brighter look in his eye, and that\r\nthe roses of returning health had already begun to bud on his cheeks. Old\r\nJanet met him in the door, and noted this.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, my lad,\" she said, with a cheery nod, \"you'll live yet awhile.\"\r\n\r\nThat same evening Janet beckoned Nannie into her own room, and having\r\nclosed the door,--\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" she said, \"my dear lassie, I'm just going to tell you, you've done\r\nyour duty like a Christian. Wi' the blessing of God ye hae saved John's\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think he is really out of danger, then?\" asked Nannie, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be in danger lang eno', if you bide ony mair wi' him,\" answered\r\nJanet, with Scottish bluntness.\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll even gang home the morn, my lass, and I'll make John himsel' come\r\nover and thank you for a' you've done for him, as soon as he can walk as\r\nfar; and mark my words, he won't let that be lang.\"\r\n\r\nSo next morning Nannie took her departure, back to her little farm in the\r\npine forest. But pussy had no such intention. She had quite recovered the\r\neffects of her late incineration; and had got a complete new coat of the\r\nsilkiest fur. Besides, she had taken quite a fancy to the miller,--for\r\nhere again cats are like women: allow them to nurse and attend you when\r\nill, and they are sure to love you. There were water-rats to catch in the\r\ndam, mice in the mill, and plenty of trout in the mill-lead, and this cat\r\nwas madly fond of sport,--so she stayed.\r\n\r\nNannie was right about the miller's recovery. Every day he extended his\r\nwalk a little farther, and by-and-by was quite able to superintend\r\nmatters at the mill.\r\n\r\nWell, one fine morning, when the country-side was busy laying down the\r\nturnips, John, dressed in his best, with a smart cane in his hand,--for\r\nthe day was to be big with his fate,--took the road and shaped his course\r\nfor Nannie's farm. Mind you, all the time that Nannie was nursing him,\r\nJohn never breathed a word of his love for her or his hopes for the\r\nfuture,--he was much too honourable to take so unfair an advantage.\r\n\r\nNannie was busy in her little garden; and either the pleasure of meeting\r\nthe miller, or the excitement of labour had flushed her cheeks, and made\r\nher look very pretty indeed.\r\n\r\n\"I just came over to help you with the garden a bit,\" said John,--the\r\nhypocrite! \"for thanks to you, Nannie, I'm just as strong as a young\r\ncolt.\"\r\n\r\nSo they worked in the garden most industriously all day, just like a\r\nsecond edition of Adam and Eve; and at sunset Nannie set out to convoy the\r\nmiller through the pine wood. Now, although they had both been chattering\r\nall day like a couple of magpies, neither now had a word to say.\r\nNevertheless they took the path as if by instinct, that led down into the\r\nhazel-copse that overlooked the wimpling Don. There were yellow primroses\r\ngrowing here, and wild sorrel, and a mossy bank; and on this our lovers\r\nsat.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said John, \"it does seem strange, but this is the very spot where we\r\nparted years ago,--and in anger, dear lassie.\"\r\n\r\nNannie was silent.\r\n\r\n\"You'll marry me now; won't you?\" continued John.\r\n\r\nA soft warm hand placed in his, was the reply; a wee mouth held up to\r\nkiss, and a face all wet with tears. What little fools women are, to be\r\nsure!\r\n\r\nIn the first harvest-moon the miller and she were married. There was a\r\nwedding-breakfast, a wedding-dinner, ay, and a wedding-ball. To this\r\nlatter came all the flower of the country; it was held in the old mill,\r\nand began as early as six in the evening. Never before in the country-side\r\nhad such a rant been seen or heard tell of. There were three small\r\nfiddles and a blind bass, besides a clarionet and a squinting fifer;--what\r\ndo you think of that for music? And there were four-and-twenty \"sweetie\r\nwives\"[7] round the door, with baskets full to the brim; and they were all\r\n_sold out before morning_,--think of that. Now the English reader has\r\nlittle notion how important a personage a \"sweetie-wife\" is at a country\r\nball. The \"sweeties\" are made up in little ornamented sixpenny bags, and\r\nto these a young man treats his partner after a dance; so you may tell how\r\nany girl is appreciated by the number of bags of sweeties in her\r\npossession. Highest of all is the belle of the ball herself,--a lovely and\r\nstately girl, who will only dance with men with beards, and who has so\r\nmany bags that her pockets will hold no more; so she keeps dealing them\r\nout with a queenly hand, to her plainer and less fair friends. Then there\r\nare stars of lesser magnitude, with enough but none to spare; and minor\r\nconstellations, with perhaps a dozen bags; and there are ten-bag beauties,\r\nand seven-bag beauties, and five-bag beauties, three-bag beauties, and\r\nbeauties with never a bag at all, who have only been thought worthy of\r\ngetting their sweeties in loose handfuls.\r\n\r\nAy, that was a ball. The miller had given orders that the lads and lasses\r\nshould \"dance the day-light in,\" and that not even a \"sweetie-wife\" should\r\ngo home sober. Then, hey! how the fiddlers played! Hey! how the dancers\r\ndanced! and hey! how the sweeties flew!\r\n\r\nAnd when, during a lull, the miller himself and his pretty wife came in to\r\ndance one reel, just for fashion sake,--oh, dear! wasn't the floor quickly\r\nfilled? The fiddlers played as they hadn't played yet; and the way the old\r\nblind bass screwed his mouth, and turned up the whites of his eyes was a\r\ncaution to see. The tune was that rattling old Scotch strathspey, \"The\r\nMiller of Drone\"; and you should just have heard the cracking of thumbs\r\nand the hooch-!-ing,--if you had had a single drop of Scottish blood,\r\ntwelve generations removed, you would have been on your pins at once. But\r\nwhen they came to the reel, the hoochs! were fired off like pistol shots,\r\ntill they ended in one jubilant hurrah!! and the rafters rang as the music\r\nstopped. Then steaming whiskey punch was handed round in bumpers from\r\nbuckets, and all drank the miller's health, and the miller's wife's\r\nhealth, and long life and happiness, and three times three, with Highland\r\nhonours. Then the miller and his bride drove off,--in a real carriage and\r\npair, mind you; with wedding-favours on the horses' heads, and tassels at\r\ntheir ears, oh! none of your half-and-half affairs; and eight-and-forty\r\nold shoes from four-and-twenty old sweetie wives, came whistling after\r\nthem, as they rattled round the corner and were lost to view.\r\n\r\nI am in a position to state, that John and his Nannie spent a most happy\r\nhoneymoon in the Highlands of their native land, in that most pleasant of\r\nall seasons when the bloom still lingers on the heather and the autumn\r\ntints are on the trees.\r\n\r\nYears have fled since then, but the old mill-wheel goes merrily round as\r\nin the days of yore; and Nannie and John are still alive, and likely to\r\nlive for many a long year. And when the miller returns from his labour of\r\nan evening to his home in the pine-wood, there are a clean fireside and a\r\nsinging kettle to welcome him; and better still, a little curly-haired boy\r\nwith his mother's eyes, and a wee baby-girl with its father's dimples and\r\nits mother's smile. Pussy is getting old, but in the long fore-nights of\r\nwinter she loves to play with the little ones on the rug, or lull them to\r\nsleep with her drowsy purr; but, when \"summer days are fine,\" she will\r\nfollow them far a-field, and the children gather gowans on the leas and\r\nstring them into garlands to hang around her neck; and at sundown, pussy,\r\nthey think, must be very tired; the good-natured cat humours the bairnies'\r\nfancy, and pretends to be nothing short of dead-beat, and so they carry\r\npussy home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\nI deem it fair both to myself and to the reader, to supplement my own\r\nevidence on the \"Curiosities of Cat Life,\" by giving the names and\r\naddresses of my authorities for those of my anecdotes, which may seem to\r\nrun contrary to the generally received opinions, concerning cats; at the\r\nsame time thanking those ladies and gentlemen, who have taken so much\r\ninterest in the progress of this work, and expressed themselves willing to\r\nvouch for the truth of the incidents herein related by me. I have tried to\r\nmake the anecdotes as readable as possible, and as humorous, as I know\r\nmany people think \"cats\" a dry subject; _but in no single instance have\r\nthe interests of truth been disregarded_. My anecdotes are what might be\r\ncalled sample anecdotes, as I have many hundreds more of the same sort, my\r\nobject being to describe _pussy as she really is_, and thus, to gain\r\nfavour for an animal hitherto understood only by the few, and abused by\r\nthe many. And, nothing would give me greater pain, than the reader to have\r\nan idea, that my cats are exceptional cats; for, I distinctly aver, that\r\n_no cat mentioned in this book, has either done or suffered anything,\r\nwhich any other cat in the kingdom cannot do or suffer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES.\r\n\r\nAnderson, Alex., Mr., New Fowlis, Crieff, N.B.\r\n\r\nAnderson, Jane, Miss, Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nBird, Miss, Snowdon Place, Stirling.\r\n\r\nBonnar, T., Mr., Largoward, St. Andrews.\r\n\r\nBudge, W., Mr., 113, Montrose Street, Brechin.\r\n\r\nBurns, D., Mr., 19, Murray Road East, Finsbury Park, London.\r\n\r\nCatto, W.

The cat mentioned in\r\nthe story was _twice_ nearly burned alive in the kiln. It was strange,\r\nthat although she took up her abode for a time at the mill, she went home\r\nto have her kittens. When the different members of her family could\r\nprovide for themselves, she went back. She was very expert at fishing and\r\ncatching water-rats. For the incidents of the story I am indebted to Mr.\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote was kindly sent me by Mr. Catto, of _The People's\r\nJournal_:--\r\n\r\nCURIOUS STORY OF A MONTROSE CAT.--About five o'clock on Friday morning the\r\nloud \"walin\" of a cat was heard at a door in Castle Street, Montrose.\r\n\"Mither,\" exclaimed Johnny to his parent, \"that's Tammie at the door.\"\r\n\"Na, na,\" said his mother, \"it canna' be him, for I threw him ower the\r\nbrig and drooned him a fortnight since.\" Nevertheless, the \"wals\" became\r\nmore loud and frequent. The good woman became terrified, and cried out,\r\n\"Oh, dinna' lat him in, Johnny; it's his ghost!\" Notwithstanding the\r\nterrific appearance of the cat, which all who have seen agree in\r\nacknowledging as something indescribably horrible, Johnny rose, cautiously\r\napproached the door, and with bated breath whispered through the keyhole,\r\n\"Is that you, Tammie?\" Three mild responsive \"wals\" were given. Thus\r\nencouraged, Johnny opened the door, and in trotted Tammie hearty and hale.\r\nHow he escaped from the strong ebb tide that was ruthlessly sweeping him\r\naway in the dread darkness of the night, is a mystery which he has not yet\r\ntold. Perhaps he is reserving it for future publication. The narrative\r\nwill be deeply affecting, and on its appearance we shall not hesitate to\r\ngive copious extracts from it. \"Tammie\" is not to be drowned again, and\r\nhis mistress thus explains why she made the attempt:--\"Weel, ye see, it's\r\nthe auld story. Tammie is gey good lookin' and had ower mony lasses\r\nrinnin' after him; and them and him made sic a disturbance upon the stair\r\nthat I was determined to get rid o' him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

The other day my\r\npublisher beckoned me into his private office, behind the shop--a sanctum\r\nchiefly remarkable for the solemn air of dusty gloom, and the aristocratic\r\ncobwebbiness, which prevails in it; and says that gentleman to me,--\r\n\r\n\"You _must_ give us a chapter on the origin and antiquity of the D. C.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I implored, \"I'm not writing about the ancestorial cat, plague take\r\nher! It is the history of the _present_ puss, with glimpses of _the coming\r\ncat_, that I wish to give.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said he, \"say something; people expect it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be so dry,\" I continued.\r\n\r\n\"Then make it all the shorter.\"\r\n\r\nHeigho! it is very like shoving a man forward by the shoulder, and asking\r\nhim to make a speech, when he feels that he can't say Bo! to a goose; or\r\nputting a fiddle into one's hand, and asking him for a selection from his\r\nfavourite opera, when he isn't in the humour to play; when, in fact, the\r\nfiddle feels like a pair of bellows, and the bow as heavy as the kitchen\r\npoker. Origin and antiquity indeed! I dreamt about origin and antiquity\r\nall night, and had origin and antiquity on the brain for a week after.\r\nHowever, needs must when the devil--hem! I mean one's publisher--drives.\r\n\r\nDetermined, therefore, to write a most learned essay on the origin and\r\nantiquity of the D.

I had taken a ream of foolscap with me,\r\na box of Gillott's extra fine, and my brandy-flask filled (for this once\r\nonly) with ink--\"I want,\" said I, to a man who came at my beck, \"all the\r\nbooks you may have in this little place, which may bear reference directly\r\nor indirectly to the subject of _cats_. CATS, sir,\" I repeated more\r\nemphatically, because I thought he smiled. \"Bring Herodotus, the father of\r\ncat-history, and Lady Cust, the mother of ditto; bring Jardine, and\r\nRüppel, and Pennant, and Bell; also Temminck, Lonnini, and Hietro dello\r\nValli; bring Daubenton the Egyptian, and Sulliman the Persian, Professor\r\nOwen, the erudite Darwin, and the learned Faust, and--Mephistopheles too,\r\nif procurable; and, look here, just throw in a few Russian, Hungarian, and\r\nTurkish authorities, and don't forget to bring lexicons to match.\" The man\r\ngroaned, and went for a barrow. Half an hour afterwards I was seated at my\r\ndesk, and if ever book-man had cause for joy, I was that individual. The\r\nillustrious authorities were piled so high above me, that an accident\r\nwould have resulted in burial alive; they were behind me, before me, I sat\r\nupon them, and I had them for footstools. But still I was not happy. I\r\nleant my head on the ream of foolscap, and tried to compose myself before\r\nI composed anything else. Presently I was roused from my reverie, by\r\nhearing some one close alongside of me make the remark, \"Hem! hem!\"\r\nclearing his throat as if to speak. On looking up, I beheld on the desk\r\nbefore me the queerest little old man ever I saw in my life. Taking him\r\nall and all, he couldn't have been anything like a yard long. His legs,\r\nnot longer nor thicker than sheep shears, were encased in silken hose and\r\nknee-breeches; his shrivelled body bedecked in tight-fitting velveteens,\r\nwith long hair tied in a cue and worn as a tail, while his face looked for\r\nall the world like a piece of ancient parchment, which had got\r\naccidentally wet, and been dried before the fire. And he sat with one leg\r\ncrossed over his knee, on a folio nearly as big as himself, and took\r\nsnuff.\r\n\r\n\"Ahem!\" he remarked again, \"take your pen, sir, and write.\"\r\n\r\nI hastened to obey, merely asking parenthetically, \"On cats?\"\r\n\r\n\"On cats,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Far away in sunny Greece,\" continued the little man, \"484 years before\r\nthe birth of Christ, and on a beautiful morning, when all nature looked\r\nfresh and gay, a fair and lovely girl might have been seen hastening--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said I, \"this will be interesting; heave round, ancient cockalorum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hastening, sir, for the midwife. If the day was bright and fine, still\r\nmore enchanting was the scenery, for it was the suburbs of the city of\r\nHalicarnassus, now called Budron, in the province of Caria. And that\r\nmorning, exactly at ten o'clock, was born into the world a sweet little\r\nbabe, afterwards the great and illustrious Herodotus.\r\n\r\n\"He wrote--indeed I may say sang, for his whole history is one noble\r\npoem--of the ancient Medes and Assyrians, and of the long line of Persia's\r\nkings; he sang the wars of Cyrus, and told the sad tale of the kingdom of\r\nLydia, and he sung the wars of gallant Darius and the Scythians, and told\r\nof conquering Cambyses, and Egypt of the olden time; and last, but not\r\nleast, sir, he wrote on _Cats_ and _Cat-life_.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sir, in Egypt in the good old times, pussy had her rights, had\r\nappreciation, had justice. If a boy had killed a cat with a stone, or a\r\nman murdered her with a dog, Lynch law would have been had on the very\r\nspot. Pussy was gently tended, cared for, and loved even to veneration,\r\nwhile alive, and after death, her little body had the honours of\r\nembalmment; her virtues were written on monumental tablets, and her memory\r\ncherished by the bereaved owners until the day of their death. In Turkey\r\ntoo, and especially in Persia, cats have been household pets as far back\r\nas man can remember. In many places hospitals were built for them,\r\nsomething after the style and fashion of your modern cat-homes; and in so\r\ngreat esteem was she held, that bloody riots and war itself were not\r\nunfrequently the result of injury done, or insult offered to pussy. In the\r\nquaint but beautiful love-songs of ancient Persia, so full of splendid\r\nimagery, do we not often find the poet comparing the bright eyes of his\r\nmistress to those of gentle pussy, or her winning ways to those of the\r\ndomestic cat?\"\r\n\r\n\"The origin of the D. C. did you say, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is the tiger of Bengal, which you have seen at a\r\ndistance--preferring no nearer acquaintance. There is the tiger-cat, or\r\nspotted leopard of Central Africa, which--I will do you the justice to\r\nsay--you have shot; and there is the kolo-kolo of Guiana--\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't,\" insinuated I, \"one kolo enough for a cat?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, sir,\" said the little man severely; \"a cat of two colours, and a\r\nvery vicious beast he is besides. There is the small serval of Africa, and\r\nthe ocelot, all too well known to need a description. But from none of all\r\nthese springs the domestic cat. Neither does it descend from the wild cat,\r\nstill common enough in Skye and Sutherland, in the mountains of Ireland,\r\nand spread here and there throughout Europe. It must be regarded as quite\r\na distinct species. Domestic pussy _will_, at odd times, escape to the\r\nhills, and, becoming a nomad, breed with the wild-cat; but the kittens\r\nwill be found far different, both in markings and shape. No, sir,\" and\r\nhere the little old man got very much excited, and took snuff so\r\nvehemently that the tears coursed down his wizened cheeks. \"No, I fully\r\nbelieve with the to-be-immortal Darwin, that mankind is descended in a\r\ndirect line from the _oyster_--\"\r\n\r\n\"And how deliciously,\" said I, \"our forefathers eat with buttered roll and\r\nstout.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _oyster_, sir,\" he repeated, not heeding the interruption; \"and I do\r\nunhesitatingly believe, that cats sprang in an equally direct line from\r\nthe _mussel_.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man then got into such an apparent ravel, among hard names and\r\ngreat unspellable authorities, that my head again drooped on the desk\r\nbefore me, and the next thing I remember, is the man--not the little old\r\nman; he had somehow or other mysteriously disappeared--touching me gently\r\non the shoulder, and giving me to understand that it was time to be\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\nI did move. And I left the reading-room as wise--if not wiser--than when I\r\nentered it, on the origin and antiquity of the domestic cat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n[_See Note A, Addenda._]\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION AND POINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the present work is not by any means intended to partake of the\r\nscientific, but is written solely with the view of gaining for the\r\ndomestic cat her proper position in society, it will, I think, serve my\r\npurpose better to describe the classification of cats generally adopted at\r\npussy-shows, instead of dividing them, as otherwise they ought to be, into\r\nthe different species and breeds. Had I adopted the latter method, I\r\nshould have felt bound to give a minute description of the cats of various\r\ncountries and climates, such as those peculiar to India, China, Abyssinia,\r\nRussia, and Persia, as well as those inhabiting our own land.\r\n\r\nThe classification adopted at the Crystal Palace Show, and also at\r\nBirmingham, is--with one exception, to be mentioned further on--as good as\r\nany we can at present have. The cats are divided into long-haired and\r\nshort-haired of both sexes, the latter being mostly English, the former\r\nincluding the various species of Angora or Persian.\r\n\r\nCLASS I. And first on the list comes _Tortoiseshell Tom_.\r\n\r\nFor many a long year, this cat was considered a myth and an impossibility;\r\nand this belief seemed to receive confirmation, when, at the first Crystal\r\nPalace Show, no Tortoiseshell Tom put in an appearance. He was all there,\r\nhowever, at the second; and people scratched their heads, and stared as\r\nthey looked at him and said, \"Well, then, to be sure, who would have\r\nthought it!\"\r\n\r\nHe isn't a beauty by any means. I have seen some seals not unlike him\r\nabout the head; and he looks as though he would take off his gloves on\r\nvery slight provocation. This cat belongs to Mr. L. Smith, Clerkenwell,\r\nLondon; but I have no doubt there are many other Tortoiseshell Toms in the\r\nworld. A friend of mine was telling me last week, that he had had one,\r\nbut that it only lived for three months.\r\n\r\nI myself know of one other; I sent a humble but enthusiastic friend of\r\nmine to treat for its purchase, but in vain--they would not part with the\r\ncat, although they have not the slightest notion of its value.\r\n\r\n\"By George, Doctor,\" says my humble but enthusiastic friend, \"if they\r\nwon't sell him I'll steal him.\"\r\n\r\n\"For shame, Fred,\" say I. And I have suggested \"cutting out\"[9] as a more\r\nhonourable expedient.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, nature seems to abhor a Tortoiseshell Tom as it does a\r\nvacuum, or a chicken with two heads.\r\n\r\nTortoiseshell cats are, as a rule, neither very large, nor very\r\nprepossessing. They have a sinister look about them, as though they would\r\nas soon bite you as not. I question too if they exhibit the same affection\r\nas other species. They are, however, excellent hunters, and brave to a\r\nfault. They will often fight with, and defeat, cats double their own\r\nweight and size.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: The comparative distinctness of markings, length and texture\r\nof _pelage_[10] (it ought to be longish and very soft and glossy) deepness\r\nof the shades of colour, entire absence of white, and general plumpness.\r\n\r\nCLASS II. _Tortoiseshell and White._ Colour to be red, yellow, black, and\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThis cat ought to be, in size, rather larger than the former, not too\r\nleggy, with a round well-pleased head and bright eyes, with the patches of\r\ncolour evenly and tastefully arranged, and the tints very decided.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: These qualities, and general condition of body and pelage.\r\n\r\nCLASS III. _Brown Tabby._ Colour to be rich brown, striped and marked with\r\nblack--no white. This is a class of very fine, noble cats. They are the\r\ntrue English cats, and, if well trained, possess all pussy's noblest\r\nattributes to perfection. They are docile, honest, and faithful, fond of\r\nchildren, careful mothers and brave fathers, though seldom taking undue\r\nadvantage of their great strength; and it is of them nearly all the best\r\ncat-stories are told.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: General size. They ought to be very large, long massive body,\r\nwith shortish legs (especially fore-legs) and exhibiting great power with\r\nsuppleness. Head ought to be large and round, with perpendicular stripes,\r\nconverging rather towards the eye-brows, and branching off horizontally\r\nover the cheeks. The face ought to have an intellectual look--not\r\nsinister, and the ears--especially in the males--must be short.\r\n\r\nThe ground-work of brown, should be of a rich colour, and the markings on\r\nthe body deeply black, and uniformly arranged. The pelage to be longer on\r\nthe chest, and marked with one bar at least, giving the appearance of a\r\nLord Mayor's Chain. The legs also ought to be striped transversely with\r\nblack. Tail long and moderately bushy.\r\n\r\nCLASS IV. _Blue or Silver Tabby._ Colour to be blue, or silver grey,\r\nstriped and marked with black. I do not know a more lovely cat than this\r\nsame Silver Tabby. They are really quite elegant cats. Of a size rather\r\nsmaller than the Brown Tabbies. They are more gracefully shaped, more\r\nlithe and quicker in all their movements. The head is also smaller and not\r\nso blunt, and the eyes piercingly bright; the ears too are a shade longer.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: General contour, and brightness of markings. Ground colour to\r\nbe something like the grey of Aberdeen granite, and markings to be deep\r\nand well placed. Pelage close and glossy.\r\n\r\nCLASS V. _Red Tabby._ Colour to be reddish, or sandy, marked with darker\r\nred, no white.\r\n\r\nThis splendid cat is, I am sorry to say, getting only too rare, and sadly\r\nneeds encouragement, for if it is allowed to die out, where shall we get\r\nour favourite red and white cats? Where even our tortoise-shell? In some\r\nparts of the country, there is a very unjust prejudice against the colour\r\nof this cat. I beg then humbly to suggest to the committees of management\r\nof cat-shows, that they ought to give a little stimulant to the breeding\r\nof this beautiful animal, in the shape of a rather higher prize. Indeed I\r\nthink it would be a good plan, to make the amount of prize-money, in all\r\nclasses, bear some sort of relation to the comparative rarity of the\r\nbreed. This sort of handicapping would, I am sure, tend to equalize the\r\nnumber of entries for each class.\r\n\r\nThe Red Tabby ought to approach in size, and shape, nearly to the Brown.\r\nThey are the same kind-hearted, good-natured animals as their brown\r\nbrethren, and as a rule are better hunters. They go farther afield, and\r\ntackle larger game, and seldom forget to bring home at least a portion of\r\neach day's game-bag. They are often, moreover, very expert fishers.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: Size and general appearance; urbanity of countenance not to\r\nbe overlooked. _Markings_--the ground colour to be a nice sandy colour,\r\nand the stripes a rich deep red, and in all respects the same shape as\r\nthose on the Brown Tabby. The eyes deep-set and a beautiful yellow.\r\n\r\nCLASS VI. _Red and White Tabby._ Colour to be reddish or sandy, marked\r\nwith white. These are very fine cats, although, perhaps not very\r\nfashionable, but some that I have seen were very beautiful; especially one\r\nI remember in Wales, a very large cat, the white ground was like the\r\ndriven snow, and the spots about the size of half-crowns, spread\r\nprodigally all over, like those in a well-bred Dalmatian dog; I do not\r\nthink that two spots in all his body coalesced.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: Size--you want this cat largish. Brightness of colouring, and\r\nregularity of markings. Tail is long and not very bushy, and eyes yellow\r\nmostly.\r\n\r\nCLASS VII. _Spotted Tabby._ Colour to be brown, blue, or light or dark\r\ngrey, marked with black or white. At most cat-shows, a good deal of\r\nconfusion exists, about what this cat ought really to be like, even among\r\nthe best judges. There is plenty of latitude given as to colour. I like\r\nthe brown, and the blue, and light or dark grey, and the black, but I\r\nabjure the white; at all events we can very easily dispense with it. The\r\ncat I have in my mind's eye at the present moment, comes, I think, well up\r\nto the mark of what a Spotted Tabby should be like. He was a large \"sonsy\"\r\nanimal, with broad brow and chest, short ears, and well-pleased face,\r\nquite the cat to sing lullabies at the farmer's fireside, or to romp in\r\ngarden or on parlour floor with the squire's bright-eyed English children.\r\nHis markings were as follows. The ground colour was dark grey; a broad\r\nblack band ran along his back and down his fine tail; and diverging from\r\nthis band came dark stripes of colour down the sides, converging round the\r\nthighs, and swirling round his chest in two Lord Mayor's chains; but the\r\nstripes had this peculiarity, they were all _broken up into spots_.\r\n\r\nCLASS VIII. _Black and White._ Colour, black evenly marked with white.\r\nThis is something more definite. The Black-and-white Tom cat is a large,\r\nhandsome, gentlemanlike fellow, a sort of cat that you could not believe\r\nwould condescend to do a dirty action, or would hardly deign to capture a\r\nmiserable mouse; and his wife is a perfect lady. I have never seen a more\r\nhandsome specimen than Miss F----n's prize cat \"Snowball.\" His eyes\r\nsparkle like emeralds; his nose and upper lip are pure white, but his chin\r\nis black. His shirt-front is spotless as the snow. He wears white gloves,\r\nnot gauntlets--gauntlets, he told me, were snobbish, and only fit for low\r\ncats--and beautiful white stockings. This cat knocks with the knocker at\r\nthe area door when he wants admission.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: Evenness of the markings; not too much white. Miss F----n's\r\nis a good example. Pelage to be thick and glossy, whiskers white, and eyes\r\na deep sea-green.\r\n\r\nCLASS IX. _Black._ Colour to be entirely black; no white. No, not a morsel\r\nof white can be here tolerated, not even on the point of the chin;\r\nalthough we often see pure black cats on whose coats Nature seems to have\r\nbeen amusing herself, by planting long single white hairs all over them.\r\nThis is sometimes, but not always, the result of age.\r\n\r\nThis cat is, above all others, the best adapted for house-hunting; for\r\nhis hearing and sight are extremely keen, and while seeing well in the\r\ndark, he is himself unseen. He is invaluable to those whose goods are\r\nliable to become a prey to vermin. He is a fierce cat when angered, but\r\nnot naturally quarrelsome.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: Size. They ought to be large, but with more grace of motion\r\nthan the Brown Tabby. Colour, all jet black, and pelage glossy and thick.\r\nWhiskers to be black as well. Eyes: green eyes better than yellow, but\r\nhazel or brown better than either.\r\n\r\nCLASS X. _White._ Colour to be entirely white: no black. These cats make\r\nvery pretty parlour cats when they are bright in colour. Millers often\r\nprefer them as hunters to black cats, thinking, perhaps with reason, that\r\nthey are not so easily seen among the bags. A perfectly white cat is a\r\nvery nice and affectionate pet; but they are often dull and apathetic.\r\nSome of them, too, are _deaf_.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: General condition of pelage and symmetry of body. Ought to be\r\ngraceful, and not too languid-looking. Must be entirely white. Eyes:\r\nought to be blue, although they are too often yellow. Eyes ought to be\r\n_both blue_. It is a defect to have eyes of different colours.\r\n\r\nCLASS XI. _Unusual Colour._ Colour to be any remarkable hue not otherwise\r\nclassified.\r\n\r\n_Judged by_: Colour, shape, size, and symmetry. A very beautiful and\r\ngraceful little cat, I saw at the Birmingham Show. It belongs to a Mr. S.\r\nLawrence, and is called \"Maltese,\" although I never saw anything like it\r\nin that island. It was all of one colour--a strange sort of slate-colour\r\nor blue: even the whiskers were of the same hue. The nose was tipped with\r\nblack, and the eyes were orange yellow.\r\n\r\nCLASS XII. _Any other Variety or Abnormal Formation._ Any colour, but of\r\nsingular form, such as Manx or six-clawed cats.\r\n\r\nThis class, I think, deserves but little encouragement. What do we want\r\nwith cats with six claws? and--this is sarcasm--cats without tails ought\r\nto be ashamed of themselves. Besides, if you bring me young kittens, I\r\nshall, with the aid of a gum lancet, and a needle and thread, make you\r\nManx cats as fast as winking; and I think I could do so less clumsily than\r\nhas been done to some Manx(?) cats I lately saw at Birmingham. And,\r\ntalking of Birmingham, there was one cat exhibited there in this class,\r\nwhich, as a Naval officer, I must be permitted to have a shy at. Was it a\r\nManx? No; very much the reverse, for, whereas a Manx cat has no tail, this\r\nbrute had no fewer than nine. It was labelled \"Garotters back-biter,\" and\r\nhailed from Millbank prison. I wish it were confined to that prison, or to\r\nany prison. By all means use it on the backs of garotters. Tickle them up\r\nwith it three times a day if you choose. But why, in this civilized age,\r\nshould this brutal weapon be still raised against our brave blue-jackets,\r\nwho defend our coast and homes, and fight our battles both by sea and\r\nland. Soldiers are now exempt from the lash; are sailors less deserving?\r\nIf not, why should a naval seaman be classed in the same catalogue, and\r\nused in the same way, as that most mean and cowardly of all creatures--the\r\ngarotter? Ugh! the scenes I have witnessed in my own short time in the\r\nservice, I would not chill the blood of the reader by describing. But this\r\ncat-o'-nine-tails has been, and is still, often used in the service, by\r\nofficers in command, not as an instrument of punishment, but of wrath and\r\nrevenge, against some poor fellow who may have unwittingly incurred their\r\ndispleasure. Then look at the demoralizing effect it has on the mind and\r\ncharacter. I have seen a brave honest man lashed up to the grating, and\r\nreceive his punishment in silence, and I have seen the same man, pale and\r\nghastly, cast loose--the blood from his bitten lips trickling over his\r\nneck--but how changed! good no longer, but reckless. And I've marked his\r\nfuture career, and seen him, in plain language, go posthaste to the devil.\r\nCan you conceive of anything more cowardly than to tie a poor fellow hand\r\nand foot, and make a brutal attack on his person? I have seen a\r\ncommander--thank God such men are few: smirking to himself, as he looked\r\non a strong man writhing in silent agony, and I have glanced from the one\r\nto the other and thought, \"_He_ is the _hero_--_you_, cocked hat, sword,\r\nand all--are the _villain_.\" Discipline must be upheld, if we would\r\ncontinue to rule the seas; but banish the cat, it can easily be dispensed\r\nwith; or, if it must be retained, let it be the terror only of thieves. If\r\na man errs, punish him, shoot him where he stands if his crime deserves\r\nit, but, Avaunt dishonour! do not flog him.\r\n\r\nOn the judging of long-haired cats very few words will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe classes, are, _Tortoiseshell and White_, _Tabby_, _Red Tabby_, _Pure\r\nWhite_, _Black_, and _Unusual Colour_.\r\n\r\nThese classes must be _judged by_:--Markings, which are wanted as distinct\r\nand well arranged as possible. Size--they ought to be large cats.\r\nPelage--ought to be _very long_ silken, and glossy. The eyes should be of\r\nthe same colour as in the short-haired classes.\r\n\r\nThe head of the male Persian should be very broad and characteristic; and\r\nthe ears short, well feathered internally, and pointing downwards and\r\nforwards. In the female, the head is much smaller and sharper.\r\n\r\nIn the pure Black cats, the hair is not so fine; and it is at times parted\r\ndown the centre like that of a well-bred Newfoundland dog.\r\n\r\nMiss Hales's Angora, \"Selim,\" is a very fine specimen--slate-coloured on\r\nthe body, the face vandyked with white, and a beautiful snowy apron in\r\nfront. His eyes are green and sparkling; and from his cage he glares out\r\nat you with a look of surly grandeur, highly characteristic of his noble\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\nThe same lady's \"Zuleika,\" a pussy imported from Smyrna, is a most lovely\r\nand engaging little thing--all white, with small round head, long hair,\r\nand pitiful eyes, as if it wanted so much to be petted--in fact just lived\r\nto be loved, and nothing else. It is a pet fit for a princess.\r\n\r\nIt is the classification of the \"Cats of no Sex\" which I think might be\r\naltered for the better. By the bye, what a ridiculous denomination--\"cats\r\nof _no_ sex\"!\r\n\r\nI think I see Lord Dundreary, after reading the catalogue, moralizing on\r\nhis finger ends.\r\n\r\n\"Catth of no theckth--that ith, neither mathculine nor feminine,--let me\r\nthee,--why, they mutht be neuter catth--catth without life. Hi! Tham; I\r\nthay, old man, they're going to hold a thow of _dead catth_.\"\r\n\r\nChildren and ladies often ask ridiculous questions about these wonderful\r\n\"cats of no sex.\"\r\n\r\nWhy not boldly adopt the terms \"Entire cats\" and \"Non-entire cats,\" and\r\nstick to them? _Honi soit qui mal y pense!_[11] Now \"non-entire cats\" are\r\nexcellent hunters and good home pets; and, if well cared for, they become\r\nvery large and beautiful, although they do at times become lazy and fat.\r\nWhy then should they not have as many classes to compete in as the\r\n\"entire\" cats?\r\n\r\nBut there is a greater mistake still made in the judging. They are judged\r\n_by weight only_. The reader can easily see, then, that there is no\r\nencouragement given to any one to breed a beautiful cat; and at all\r\ncat-shows, you will be surprised to find very ugly cats labelled _first\r\nand second_ prize, next cage to a perfect beauty, whose only misfortune\r\nwas, that he had no appetite for breakfast that morning, and consequently\r\nlost the prize by two ounces--_of beef-steak_. No; these cats must be\r\njudged by their other qualities, of course giving a certain number of\r\npoints for extra weight. Example--I happen to know a cat which I'll back\r\nfor ugliness, against any puss in the three kingdoms. He was originally\r\nwhite, but is now beautifully ornamented with cinder holes all over; his\r\nface is seamed with bloody scars, got in honourable conflict; and you\r\nought just to see that cat throw back the remains of his ears and scowl. I\r\nought to have entered him at last Birmingham Show--he would have been\r\nfirst; but, as the lassie said, I \"didna like.\" But, if there is no\r\nalteration by next year, Egad! he shall go to Birmingham and the Crystal\r\nPalace too; and I think for weight he'll beat at both places.\r\n\r\n_Wild Cats._ These animals are still to be found in some of the most\r\nsolitary regions of Skye and Sutherland: and, I am told, they are\r\nsometimes seen in the mountainous parts of Connemara. Like the brown Tabby\r\nof domesticity, they vary considerably in their markings; but they can\r\nnever be mistaken for any other. As a rule, the ground colour is yellowish\r\ngrey, with dark stripes--the markings being at times, as even and\r\nbeautiful as those of the Bengal tiger. The tail is shorter, and more\r\nbushy than that of the domestic cat; and the head, if once seen, or the\r\nvoice, if once heard, can never be forgotten. Those I have seen killed,\r\nwere all anything but fat, or even in very good condition, showing, I\r\nthink, that their life must be rather a hard and miserable one.\r\n\r\nOn the north-west shore of the Isle of Skye, between Kilmuir manse and the\r\nromantic ruin called Duntulm Castle, stands a mountain,--or rather one\r\nhalf of a mountain, the other half, by some gigantic agency, is levelled\r\nto the ground, and lies spread over the sea-shore in acres of large\r\nboulders--the precipitous sides of the cleft mountain rising up at one\r\nside, and the waves of the Atlantic for ever thundering on the other. A\r\nroad has been made straight over these boulders. Late one summer's night I\r\nwas coming home along this road, all alone with the exception of a little\r\nwire-haired terrier called Kooran. I was just about the centre; the moon\r\nwas well down in the West, and cast my shadow far over the heaps of\r\nstones. I was gazing up at the beetling cliffs above me and wondering\r\nwhether any one would ever find the hidden treasure of gold and precious\r\nstones which, they say, lies buried in a cave somewhere on this mountain's\r\nside, watched over by a malignant fairy (_see Note B, Addenda_), when I\r\nwas startled from my reverie by a sound which I should in vain attempt to\r\ndescribe. It was partly growl, partly scream,--angry, mournful, horrible.\r\nKooran's tail sought instant refuge between his legs; and although I had\r\non a decent-sized Scotch bonnet, which might weigh somewhere over two\r\npounds, I think my hair raised it; at any rate my legs seemed suddenly to\r\nbecome ethereal, and I did not feel the ground beneath my feet until I\r\nhad rounded the distant corner, and left both cat and mountain a good mile\r\nbehind me. The prey of the Wild Cat is principally rabbits, and game of\r\ndifferent sorts; and in the month of May they sometimes commit great\r\ndepredations among the young lambs. Of course the keepers trap and shoot\r\nthem on every possible occasion. It is not very often, however, that they\r\nmanage to get a shot at them, it being the habit of the wild-cat to lie\r\n_perdu_ all day, coming out only at night to hunt their quarry, or at\r\nearly morning. Several stories of adventures with these dreadful creatures\r\ncould be told, if space permitted. I shall only mention one, which I do\r\nnot think has yet found its way into print. (_See Note C, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nLiddesdale, it will do the reader no harm to know, is the southernmost\r\nparish in Roxburghshire. Some years ago a shepherd who used to reside here\r\nleft for the Highlands. He had a family of boys. One day, while these lads\r\nwere running about among the hills and woods, they started a large wild\r\ncat, and--for keepers' children know no fear--at once gave chase. Puss\r\ntook to a tree. Thinking they were now sure of her, one of the boys took\r\nhis jacket off, and prepared to climb and dislodge her; while the others\r\nstood round with stones, to do for her when she came down. They saw their\r\nbrave companion climb the tree; they saw the monster come down to meet\r\nhim, and fasten on his neck. They looked up horrified; there was scarcely\r\na cry, save the low growl of the cat; a few drops of blood came pattering\r\ndown, and then the children ran off screaming towards home. The father was\r\nsoon on the spot, joined by some men with dogs. One of these instantly\r\ndrew his knife and commenced to climb the tree. The enraged brute now left\r\nthe boy and came down to attack the man; but the struggle was brief; the\r\ncat was dashed, wounded, to the ground, where it was speedily despatched\r\nby the dogs and men. But there was no sound from above. The poor boy was\r\nfound lying on his back athwart the branches, his head and arms drooping\r\ndownwards--_dead_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPUSSY'S PATIENCE AND CLEANLINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to a cat's love for children, if there is one thing more than another\r\nthat ought to make one love her and respect her as a pet, it is the\r\nextreme patience which she evinces under sufferings, sometimes the most\r\nacute. We talk about dogs being game, and taking their death easy; and so\r\nthey mostly do under excitement; but in long lingering illnesses, pussy is\r\na much better patient.\r\n\r\nPussy, moreover, is blessed with extreme good-nature, and will pardon\r\nalmost any injury from one she loves. I have no patience with people who\r\nsay that cats are unforgiving, or that \"a friendship of years may be\r\ncancelled in a moment, by an accidental tread on its tail or feet.\"\r\n\"Look,\" the same parties will tell you, \"how patiently a dog will bear a\r\nlike accident.\"\r\n\r\nAy; but, say I, you must bear in mind three things:--First, a dog is\r\ngenerally larger than a cat, and a tread is consequently a mere trifle to\r\nhim. Secondly, a cat is ten times more sensitive to pain than a dog. And,\r\nthirdly, a cat has so many enemies of all sorts, that she must be for ever\r\non the alert to avert danger; not knowing when a foe may pounce upon her,\r\nshe has to sleep even with open ears. Is it any wonder, then, that, when\r\nroused from slumber by a cruel and painful tread on her tail, she should\r\nstart up and show fight, or run off growling--perhaps, indeed, only\r\nhalf-awake? But malice she never harbours in her heart; and in half an\r\nhour, when she has thought the matter over, she will creep from under the\r\nsofa or bed, to fondly caress the very one who hurt her.\r\n\r\nNo animal appreciates kindness more than a cat. Witness the gratitude even\r\na poor stray will evince, to any one who may have fed it when hungry.\r\n\r\n\"Not long ago,\" writes a lady to me, \"a cat (one of the kind kept as a\r\nmachine) used to frequent our garden, starved enough, poor thing, as its\r\nknotty fur betokened; so, having a trap set in our house to catch mice,\r\nand being always more or less successful in catching the vermin, I one\r\nday took the trap, with a mouse in it, to the garden, and by dint of very\r\nlittle persuasion, managed to get near this cat waif, and give it the\r\nmouse. That was quite enough; it got them ever after, so long as it was in\r\nlife; and invariably from that date whenever it saw me in the garden, it\r\nwould come bounding to me. And I am sure, by its dumb delight, it well\r\nrepaid me, showing that it fully appreciated both the voice, and hand of\r\nkindness.\" (_See Note D, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nIt is this same patience in her nature, that makes our domestic cat such\r\nan excellent hunter and vermin killer. We all know how patiently she will\r\nsit in a corner, and watch for a mouse or rat. She knows very well it will\r\ncome sooner or later, and she is always rewarded with success. She is the\r\nsame in the hunting-field, waiting for hours at the door of a\r\nrabbit-burrow, till poor Bunny, or some one of her children, peeps out;\r\nthen, \"I'll have you,\" says puss, and forthwith walks it off. Or, hidden\r\nunder a heather hillock, or a turnip-leaf, she will wait and wait, and\r\nnever weary, until she can secure a beautiful grouse, or plump little\r\npartridge. Witness their patience and long-suffering with children,--this\r\nI have already spoken about, and need not repeat,--having proved, in a\r\nformer chapter, that they not only bear, but even seem to like, a certain\r\namount of rough treatment at baby hands.\r\n\r\nTucker was about the best-natured lump of a cat I ever knew. You might\r\nhave done anything with him--flung him over the church for instance. If\r\nyou had, I dare be sworn, Tucker would have alighted on his feet at the\r\nother side, and gone quietly off to sleep. No, he was not a particularly\r\ngood hunter, he was hardly cruel enough to kill a mouse; but he had a\r\nspirit of his own for all that, and if you had shaken your finger at him,\r\nhe would have let you have it straight from the shoulder. (_See Note E,\r\nAddenda._)\r\n\r\nTucker used to submit himself, quietly, to be tied up in a towel, and\r\nplaced in a scale opposite a leg of mutton, or Scotch cheese. He was once\r\nsent a distance of thirty yards, trussed up in this fashion, to a\r\nshopkeeper's place, to be weighed. Tucker went through the operation so\r\npatiently, that the grocer never suspected till the very last.\r\n\r\n\"A good solid hare,\" he said, feeling the bundle; \"but bless me, isn't he\r\nwarm? Do you think he is really dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Err-a-wa-ow,\" said Tucker, popping out his head at a corner, as much as\r\nto say, \"Not just yet, friend;\" and the laugh was all against the grocer.\r\n\r\nHow patiently a cat will wait for her dinner, until every one else is\r\nserved, reminding you only then, by her loud singing and demonstrative\r\nkindness, that there is still a little hole in her stomach that wants\r\nfilling! And, how patiently sit and wait, and watch for the return of her\r\nmaster or mistress, be they never so long absent! She knows their\r\nfootsteps, and jumps up at their knock, and runs to the door to meet them.\r\n\r\nI know of a poor cat that was for a whole fortnight in a trap. The cruel\r\nkeepers had left him for all that time, without either food or drink; he\r\nwas afterwards discovered by his owner, and taken home. Although a\r\nbeautiful large Tom tabby when he left home, he was reduced to a perfect\r\nskeleton. His leg had to be amputated; but he bore the operation without\r\nflinching, struggling a little at first only, but giving vent to no\r\nexpression of pain. He made a very good recovery; but, being one of the\r\nmighty-hunter persuasion, as soon as he was perfectly recovered, he hopped\r\noff to the woods again. He did not return, however, and for two years was\r\nnot seen again; but one dark night, his master, on passing through a wood,\r\nhad his attention attracted by the cries of a cat. The animal was in a\r\ntree; and, on the gentleman's approach, it sprang down, and commenced\r\nrubbing round his legs, with every expression of affection and kindness.\r\nOn bending down to caress it, the gentleman was surprised to find it had\r\nonly three legs. It followed him home, and he then made certain it was\r\nnone other than his long-lost pet. It stopped at home for many a day after\r\nthis, and seemed in no way inconvenienced from the loss of its hind-leg.\r\nBut travellers never can settle, and puss took to the woods again, and\r\nthis time fell a victim to the keeper's vengeance. (_See Note F,\r\nAddenda._)\r\n\r\nAnother cat of my acquaintance was in like manner caught in a trap, and\r\nhad to endure amputation of the leg; although in much suffering and pain,\r\nit bore it without a murmur.\r\n\r\n\"I witnessed, only last week,\" says a young lady, \"while residing with my\r\nmarried sister, down in Kent, an instance of great patience and endurance\r\nin a cat. A Dandie Dinmont dog was dragging her round and round the garden\r\nwalks by the tail, and instead of being annoyed, pussy seemed really to\r\nenjoy it.\"--(_See Note G, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nCats know as well as a human beings, that, when you are examining and\r\ntreating their hurts--whether inflicted by traps or stones--you mean to do\r\nthem good. Cats, even strange cats, often lick my hands when I am probing\r\na wound and inflicting the most severe pain on them.\r\n\r\nCats always show gratitude by licking your hand; it is the greatest\r\ncompliment a cat can pay you, for they are not so ready as dogs, to sow\r\ntheir kisses and caresses broad-cast.\r\n\r\nI was amused the other day, at seeing the care and attention a little girl\r\nwas bestowing on a pet cat. Tom had been out all night, and came in next\r\nday on three legs; the one he carried was wounded, bruised, and much\r\nswollen, and Tom himself looked generally seedy and out of sorts. Now, had\r\nit been a boy instead of a girl, he would, in all probability, have done\r\nnothing useful. But females are always practical; and this embryo Miss\r\nNightingale, after having a good cry, set about at once to put matters\r\nstraight for poor Tom. She bathed the leg in warm water, and encircled it\r\nwith a large poultice. Then she rolled him in an old shawl, and put him to\r\nbed in a basket. Tom kept his bed for ten days, during which time, she fed\r\nhim from a plate, not allowing him to get up; and every time the poultice\r\nwas changed, the cat licked her hand in evident gratitude. In fact, Tom\r\nmade the best of patients, being more like a sincere Christian than\r\nanything else; and his little nurse was finally rewarded, by having her\r\npet gambolling around her as usual.\r\n\r\nA cat, some time ago, received a charge of ragged shot in his shoulder. He\r\nfainted from loss of blood, and afterwards had high fever, just as a human\r\nbeing would have done, under like circumstances. The greater portion of\r\nthe shot was extracted, or worked out in the process of healing; one\r\nportion, however, pussy carried to his grave with him. During the painful\r\nprocess of having his wounds probed for shot, pussy never even groaned.\r\n(_See Note H, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nBut it is in long and severe illnesses that pussy's patience is best\r\nexemplified.\r\n\r\nA poor cat, many years ago, took a severe illness--jaundice. He was a fine\r\nlarge Tom cat, of the name of Tacket, and a very great pet; but in a short\r\ntime he got reduced to a mere bag of bones; his fine fur came out in\r\nparts, and in parts hung about him like tassels. So pitiful an object\r\nlooked he, that his master and mistress had the sin of keeping him alive\r\nforcibly pointed out to them by their friends. Indeed, he was now so weak\r\nas to be unable to move from his bed by the kitchen fire. On the 10th day,\r\nwhen he was at his very worst, a little raw meat was given him; and, his\r\nhead being supported, he managed to swallow it. This was the turning point\r\nof his illness; he began to rally, and soon got well, and plump, and\r\nsleek; and the other day died at the age of twelve. But it was a treat to\r\nsee how patiently poor Tacket bore his illness. Every morning, when his\r\nmaster went to see him, although he could not rise, he tried to sing. But\r\nthe power of purring left him as he got weaker; on the 9th day he could\r\njust sing one bar, and on the 10th day only one note. This cat had a great\r\ndislike, for months afterwards, to milk in any shape or form; from having\r\nbeen continually dosed with it while sick, he used positively to shiver at\r\nthe sight of it. (_See Note I, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nBut I have, I believe, said enough to prove pussy's claim to the\r\nvirtues of both patience and gratitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGORA.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by MISS M. ARMITAGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSIAN.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by ---- MONGREDIAN, ESQ.]\r\n\r\n_Habits of Cleanliness in Cats._ It must be allowed, that of all our\r\ndomestic pets, pussy undoubtedly bears the bell for personal cleanliness.\r\nNature has adorned her with a most beautiful coat, of the softest,\r\nsilkiest fur and loveliest of colours; and she spares no pains to keep it\r\nclean and smart. I firmly believe that the cat is very proud of her\r\nappearance, and likes to cut a dash--here again, by the bye, she resembles\r\nthe female of the human family. Pussy is for ever cleaning and washing at\r\nherself. If a well-bred parlour cat, she will never allow a speck of dirt\r\nto sully her fur. I can always tell whether a cat is properly cared for,\r\nand has sufficient food, by the appearance of her coat. If she is allowed\r\nto be hungry, or is badly housed, she soon loses all taste in herself, and\r\ndoesn't care a rat's tail how she looks.\r\n\r\nWhen a cat's coat begins to appear rough and stare, it is the first\r\nindication of approaching illness; and this symptom will never be\r\nunattended to by those who love their pet.\r\n\r\nI have known cats take ill and die from having their coats accidentally\r\nsoiled beyond remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTRICKS AND TRAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the tricks which cats perform are highly amusing. Of course I\r\nrefer to our fireside puss, and not to publicly performing cats; these\r\nrequire special training, and a large amount of educating. But almost any\r\ncat will, either of her own accord or with very little teaching, perform\r\nantics and capers enough to amuse children at least, if not indeed to make\r\nolder people smile.\r\n\r\nCats must be trained when young; and the very first thing you must teach\r\nthem is _to love you_. If you can accomplish this, they will learn almost\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nCats have great jumping power naturally; and this power can be greatly\r\nincreased, by proper exercise in the days of their kitten-hood. They can\r\nspring almost incredible distances, either up or down. My own favourite,\r\nwhen one year old, used to jump clean over the parlour door, fetching away\r\na bit of meat that had been placed on the top. The best method of\r\ninstructing a cat in leaping heights, is to place bits of food at\r\ndifferent elevations, and encourage her to bring them down. She will soon\r\nbe able to spring seven or eight feet easily; and this same exercise will\r\nstand her many a good turn, in her predatory excursions in the field, or\r\nher amatory perambulations on the tiles. I have seen a cat, thus trained,\r\nspring from one house-top to another, a distance of fully ten feet; there\r\nwere three other cats, but none dared follow her. I know of a cat, of the\r\nextraordinary weight of 22 lbs., that springs with apparent ease from the\r\nparlour-floor on to a door over six feet high. (_See Note K, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nAt Preston, the other day, my lady Muff chose to declare herself \"on the\r\nspree.\" As usual on such occasions, half a dozen Toms came to serenade\r\nher; and loudly they sang of her charms. The night being muggy and wet, I\r\ndetermined to keep her ladyship within doors, so Theodore Nero was sent\r\nout to reason with her lovers, while I shut puss up in the bedroom. In\r\nthis act of incarceration I was encouraged by the starling, who was busy\r\nexamining the anatomy of the pin-cushion, but who left off boring holes to\r\nsay,--\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, doctor! _Br-ravo!_\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll _bravo_ you, presently, if you don't mind,\" said Muff as plainly as\r\neyes and eyebrows could speak. Muff was exceedingly wroth.\r\n\r\n\"Is--is--_is_ cats to be trusted?\" remarked Dick musingly to himself, as\r\nhe re-commenced playing Old Harry with the pin-cushion. Now the bed-room\r\nwindow was just twenty feet from the ground, and had been left open at the\r\ntop. When I went up to bed, I unlocked the door and entered\r\ncautiously--for I knew all her tricks and manners. The starling was\r\nperched on the looking-glass, asleep, and Muffie was gone. The blind was\r\ndisarranged. She had jumped over. I went down with a carpet-bag, to look\r\nfor her remains; but there weren't any. Muffie came in at tea-time next\r\nday, seedy rather, but triumphant.\r\n\r\nAnother capital plan to teach a cat to leap a height, is to attach a\r\nhare's foot to a piece of string at the end of a fishing rod, and set it\r\nin motion. You can thus regulate the elevation to pussy's daily increasing\r\ncapabilities. I have seen a cat bring her kittens to this gymnasium, and\r\nteach the whole four of them to jump and seize the hare's foot, which she\r\nherself used to set in motion.\r\n\r\nA very common trick, is to teach pussy to jump through your arms. Begin by\r\nholding them low between your legs; having taught her to leap thus, hold\r\nthem to one side, and make her jump either way backwards and forwards.\r\nGradually increase the height, till, standing erect, you form a large P,\r\nand puss springs through the bend of it. Then hold your arms right above\r\nyou, slightly bending your neck and your cat--presuming the reader is\r\nanything under seven feet high--shall leap right over your head.\r\n\r\nVery pretty and effective exercise for a cat, is hoop-leaping. It costs\r\nlittle trouble to teach, and every cat will learn it. For this, you must\r\nbe provided with a little switch, not to hit the cat, but merely to make a\r\nnoise in the air. Pronounce the word \"hoop\" each time you hold the article\r\nin front of her, and she will soon learn to go through in whatever\r\nposition you hold it. Or you may have a series of hoops, at different\r\nelevations, placed in the garden, a few yards apart; or, better still,\r\nhung from the couples of a barn or grain-loft. On these last a young and\r\nhealthy cat soon becomes quite a wonderful performer; and, if you wish her\r\nto be still more highly educated in the hoop business, you can dip your\r\nhoop in methylated spirits of wine and set fire to it; she will go through\r\njust the same. Or cover the hoop with thin tissue paper, and teach her to\r\ngo through it. At first the paper must be oiled, so as to be nearly\r\ntransparent. A friend of mine, coming home at twelve o'clock the other\r\nnight, heard an awful noise and rattling in an out-house which he had\r\nfitted up as a cat gymnasium. On going in with a light, he was surprised\r\nto find two full-grown kittens performing--they had been giving a dark\r\n_séance_ on their own account.\r\n\r\nAfter any performance, you must never forget to reward poor puss with food\r\nand water, which latter, on these occasions, she will prefer to milk.\r\nCats, you know, are not very fond of music, still I have known them taught\r\nto move rhythmically to it.\r\n\r\nThe hearth-rug is the arena on which puss may be taught to perform a\r\nvariety of tricks. I know a cat that, if you ask her to show you how a\r\nhare lies in the market, throws herself on the floor on her side, and,\r\nstretching her fore-legs and hind-legs in a line with her body, lies\r\nthere, to all appearance dead, till you bid her rise.\r\n\r\nI know a cat that turns somersaults on request. You can easily teach a cat\r\nto beg after the fashion of a broken-haired terrier, as also to give a\r\npaw--right or left, and to jump on your knee, and, placing its two\r\nfore-legs one on each side of your neck, execute quite a theatrical\r\nembrace. Or you may make her stand in a corner on her hind-legs, until\r\nrequested to drop down. I know a pussy that jumps on a chair at the\r\nbidding of her mistress, and, placing her fore-paws over the back, rests\r\nher head on them, and simulates sleep. Indeed, nothing is more easy than\r\nto teach a cat to open or shut her eyes at the word of command. (_See Note\r\nL, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nThere are two things which every household puss may, and ought to be,\r\ntaught, viz., to come and lie down quietly by the fire or on the sofa,\r\nwhen told, and to \"watch,\" that is, to sit by a mouse hole, where you know\r\na mouse to be, until she catches it; but you must never deceive her.\r\n\r\nI know of a daft little puss who sits on her master's shoulder at dinner;\r\nand when he is about to treat himself to some specially tempting morsel,\r\ncleverly snatches it from the fork as he is putting it to his mouth, and\r\ntransfers it to her own. She does it with such an apparent appreciation of\r\nthe fun of the joke, that no one could be angry with her. (_See Note M,\r\nAddenda._)\r\n\r\nYou can easily teach your cat to become an expert fisher, by throwing\r\nhalf-dead minnows on the top of the water, and encouraging her to jump in\r\nand seize them.\r\n\r\nCats can be taught to ring the bell and to open the door.\r\n\r\nBut whatever other tricks or performances you may care to teach her, it is\r\nvery much for pussy's future welfare that she should, when young, have\r\nplenty of leaping exercise; and if, at the same time, you make a good\r\nretriever of her, she will form the habit of always bringing home her\r\nprey. For, with all due respect for the game laws, I do like to see a cat\r\ncome trotting home in the gloaming, with a nice young leveret or a plump\r\npartridge in her mouth; nobody is any the poorer, and her master has\r\nsomething nice for supper. You teach a cat to retrieve with a hare's foot.\r\nTeach her in the parlour first, then by flinging the plaything out of\r\ndoors. She will soon learn to bring it in and lay it at your feet. A\r\nfreshly-killed bird may then be used, and you will very soon have the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing her invariably bring home her quarry.\r\n\r\nIn the country, but only in the country, you may teach your cat to follow\r\nyou in your walks just like a dog, and she will never lose you either by\r\nnight or day.\r\n\r\nCats come to your \"whistle\" much better than to any other call.\r\n\r\nIn training this interesting animal, you must have every consideration for\r\nher failings and weaknesses, and must never forget that she will do almost\r\nanything, for one who loves her and treats her with kindness.\r\n\r\nInculcate habits of cleanliness in grown cats. There are times when,\r\nthrough accident or having been shut in a room, even the most\r\nhighly-trained cat will deviate from the paths of decency. Never\r\naltogether overlook a thing of this sort. Take the cat, gently, but\r\nfirmly, to the place, and show her you are angry--cats are dreadfully\r\nfrightened at a scolding--this will generally prevent a repetition of the\r\noffence. But if the same thing should occur again, and there is no excuse\r\nof a closed room or a locked door, then corporeal punishment becomes\r\nnecessary. But it must not be severe, or all remembrance of her crime will\r\nbe lost in the pain of the correction. Cats are very delicate, and easily\r\ninjured about the head. Carry her at once to the scene of her\r\nmisdemeanour, and ask her if she sees it, then with a little bit of\r\nwhalebone switch her several times across the fore-paws; or tips only of\r\nthe ears, and turn her outside the front door. But in no case should\r\ncorrection partake of the nature of revenge.\r\n\r\nIf the cat-fancier will attend to these simple rules, he will have cats\r\nthat he will be proud of, and they will be proud of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCRUELTY TO CATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it my duty to warn the reader that this is essentially a chapter\r\nof horrors; so that if her or his feelings do not tend in that direction,\r\nit may be skipped. If it pains any one to read it, it must be remembered\r\nthat it was much more painful to me to write it; and only the hope of\r\nenlisting the sympathy of the kind-hearted and benevolent in pussy's\r\nfavour could have induced me to do so. How far I have been successful,\r\ntime will tell. Indeed, I believe the day is not far distant, when it will\r\nbecome the fashion, nay even a portion of our religion, to treat all\r\nanimals, from the dog downwards, with kindness and consideration; and,\r\nwhen necessity determines life to be taken, to take it in the least cruel\r\nand most humane manner possible. A good and noble work has been begun by\r\nthe Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. All honour to it,\r\nand success to its organ, _The Animal World_. The field is indeed a wide\r\none; and one can scarcely help feeling almost despairingly, as he looks\r\nabroad upon the world, and sees the vast amount of cruelty there is to\r\nsuppress. But stone by stone old Rome was built; and as the good work\r\nadvances, the labourers will increase, and success in the end is certain.\r\nAs the case now stands, I think the assistance, of the pulpit by precept,\r\nand of the great and rich by example, is sadly wanted to support the\r\ncause. The efforts of the Society are at present more particularly\r\ndirected to obtaining convictions against offenders for ill-treating,\r\noverloading, or torturing horses and donkeys; for improperly conveying and\r\nstarving cattle, calves, pigs, and goats; for cruelties to birds, and for\r\nill-using dogs and cats. Alas! poor pussy comes last and least. But, as\r\nthe world advances in civilization, and becomes more humane, new laws will\r\nhave to be framed, anent the great ocean of cruelty, the waves of which we\r\nsee tumbling and breaking around us every day, and making us apathetic,\r\nbecause of their very number and our own inability to oppose them.\r\n\r\nWhy should horses be for ever worked to death, or till death? Why should\r\ntheir labours and hardships be increased, with their increasing years and\r\ninfirmities? We care for and love them when young and handsome; when they\r\ngrow old we forget their former services, ill-treat and starve them, and\r\nfinally thrash them into the knacker's yard.\r\n\r\nWhy should donkeys--those patient, much-enduring animals--be all their\r\npoor lives treated with such systematic brutality?\r\n\r\nWhy should cattle of all sorts be driven to the markets, or conveyed by\r\nrail or steam-boat for long dreary journeys, without either food or water?\r\nWhy should they be slaughtered with so little regard to their sufferings,\r\nwhen the sting of death could be so easily drawn, ere the fatal blow was\r\nstruck?\r\n\r\nWhy should turkeys, fowls, geese, and ducks be carried to market, with\r\nfeet tied, and hung over poles head downwards, or huddled together in\r\ncramped baskets, and kept, sometimes, in such pain and suffering that\r\ndeath itself must be sweet relief?\r\n\r\nWhy should pigeons, and other smaller birds, be shot in so cowardly and\r\ninhumane a manner as is the fashion at matches in the present day?\r\nCockfighting itself is much less cruel; for there each bird has a chance\r\nof life, and the wounded are slain.\r\n\r\nFor the numerous cruelties inflicted on fishes, we can hardly name a\r\nremedy yet; but has the reader ever thought of the agony which must be\r\nendured by the lobster and crab in being boiled alive?\r\n\r\nAll these outrages on animal life might be prevented or greatly\r\nameliorated by just and proper laws. England, I trust, will be the first\r\nto take the lead in this matter; and, depend upon it, that nation's arm\r\nwill always be the strongest on the day of battle, that, in the time of\r\npeace, is employed in labours of love, and in the advancement of\r\ncivilization and humanity.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedans are far before us in kindness to the lower animals.\r\n\"Accursed be he who spilleth blood,\" is one of their sayings.\r\n\r\nNow, the Hindoos, for instance, are a much older nation than we are. They\r\nwere clothed, and in their right minds, thousands of years before we were\r\nout of pig-skin kilts and paint. We are trying to learn from theory what\r\nthey have found out from long experience, and will no doubt arrive at the\r\nsame conclusions after the loss of much valuable time. I know a gentleman\r\nwho puts faith in no statement in the abstract, even if the speaker should\r\nbe as old as Methuselah--which isn't often the case--and as wise as Ahab,\r\nuntil he has carefully ground, as it were, the syllogism in his own mill,\r\nthoroughly sifted it, and microscopically examined it; then he looks\r\nsurprised, smiles, and says, \"By George, old Thingummy was right after\r\nall.\" He can't help it however; it is the result of a too liberal\r\neducation. He is constantly grinding away at a proverb. Now, I think\r\nproverbs are the pith of a nation's experience: the wisdom of a country is\r\nskimmed off, boiled, evaporated to dryness, burned to get rid of organic\r\nimpurities, and the residue washed and distilled, and the essential oil\r\nbottled--in a proverb. But my learned friend, on first hearing one, says,\r\n\"Oh, nonsense! Can't be.\" The proverb haunts him, however, both by night\r\nand day, for perhaps a fortnight, perhaps longer, until it is properly\r\nthought out in all its bearings; _then_ he believes it--not before. He\r\nwould save much time by having a little more credulity; but he is getting\r\nwise, and if he lives long enough he will be very wise indeed, although\r\nthe process may cost him his teeth--he is bald already.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos have, long ago, come to the conclusion that it is wrong to\r\ntake life, and accordingly they don't--barring that they murder their\r\nwives when it is required. I think they are right, although I myself draw\r\nthe line at naval cockroaches; and the fact that they are disagreeable\r\nthings to kill, may have something to do with my sparing them. Besides, a\r\ncockroach has so many relations, and these all come to his funeral, and\r\ninsist on seeing him decently interred. This ceremony they perform by\r\ntasting, tasting at him until nothing remains.\r\n\r\nI was one day \"counting my pieces\" to my Indian washerman, on the deck of\r\nmy cabin, when out from the bosom of a nightshirt dropped a nine-inch-long\r\ncentipede in the full vigour of health and intellect, and began making the\r\nbest of his way to the nearest shelter. Giving instant chase, and having\r\nthe advantage in length of legs, if not in number, I should soon have run\r\nhim down, had not the impudent Hindoo, at the very last moment, pulled me\r\nback by my frock-coat tails. Such an indignity to a British officer, on\r\nboard a British man-o'-war, was hardly to be borne with impunity. I\r\nturned, and looking him full in the face in my most impressive manner--\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"are you aware that Britons never, _never_,\r\nNEVER--will--be--slaves?\"\r\n\r\nThe dobee salaamed.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued I, \"what have you got to say, that I should not punch\r\nyour head or kick your rascally shins, for conniving at the escape of\r\nyonder centipede that has just gained his crevice, and is, even now,\r\nmaking faces at me with impunity?\"\r\n\r\nThe dobee drew himself up.\r\n\r\n\"Sahib,\" said he, \"you can kickee my head, you can punchee my shin--all\r\nsame. Allah is good, and the Koran say, 'Thou shalt not kill.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_Thou shalt not kill_,\" repeated I; \"why, the man must have learned the\r\n'Shorter Catechism;' he can't be such a heathen after all.\"\r\n\r\nThe dobee triumphed. I shook him by the hand, and he had my washing ever\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nEnter my servant one day. I was living in a room on shore at Bombay.\r\n\r\n\"Man come for your little ones, Sahib,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Pandoo,\" said I in a solemn voice, \"what do you mean? I'm a respectable\r\nunmarried man, and never deserved any.\"\r\n\r\nThe man, who entered behind Pandoo, carried a shovel, a brush, and a\r\nbasket; and I soon discovered that my little ones meant all the earwigs,\r\nbugs, centipedes, and crickets, of which I had a fair sprinkling of each\r\nsort; and he came, not to destroy, but actually to carry them away. He\r\nswept my room and bed moderately clean, and I afterwards found that he had\r\ntaken the contents of the basket to the corner of a field, and emptied\r\nthem among some straw. For no true Buddhist takes life; and when cows and\r\nhorses get infirm, they are regularly superannuated, and sent to an asylum\r\nwhere they may end their days in peace.\r\n\r\nThe scenes of cruelty to the lower animals, which one witnesses in the\r\nstreets and lanes of our own country, are almost enough to make one doubt\r\nthe goodness of God. In many cases, a person at all sensitive cannot\r\nrefrain from interfering; and, unless he can show some proper authority\r\nfor so doing, he will in most cases come off second-best, and do harm to\r\nthe very victim he meant to protect. I have often constituted myself a\r\nsort of knight-errant to distressed quadrupeds; and I flatter myself I\r\nhave at times done some good, either by going quietly up to the\r\nperpetrator of the cruelty and trying to reason with him, or, with a\r\npretended show of authority, demanding his name and address. A man of this\r\nsort is always a coward, and usually \"funks\" at once. I once had my nose\r\nbroken, though, in a row with a butcher about ill-treating a cow. That\r\nbrought my knight-errantry to a bloody close for a fortnight; but, thanks\r\nto good surgery, the organ is none the worse.\r\n\r\nLast February, while walking in a lane in the neighbourhood of a rural\r\nvillage, I met a fellow--certainly the most brutal lout ever I\r\nsaw--driving, or rather pushing along, two unhappy sheep. The creatures\r\nhad walked a very long distance, and appeared completely exhausted; for\r\nthe wind was very high, and the cold rain and sleet were beating in their\r\nfaces, and stupifying them. Besides, the scoundrel had been striking them\r\nwith a strong black-thorn cane; and, as he dared not touch them about the\r\nbody, for fear of injuring the appearance of the mutton,--for mutton they\r\nsoon would be,--it was across the forehead and nose he hit them, so the\r\nblood was trickling down in streams, and as they shook their heads with\r\npain, their pretty fleeces were all besmeared. Oh, the amount of misery\r\ndepicted in their poor patient eyes! The very dogs seemed ashamed of their\r\nmaster's conduct.\r\n\r\n\"It's to be killed, they are to be, at any rate,\" said the fellow when I\r\nremonstrated with him on his conduct; \"and, curse them,\" he cried, \"I'll\r\nmake them go.\" And again the blows began to fall. The sheep moaned low,\r\nand I closed with my friend. A vicious tussle, and the stick flew over the\r\nhedge. Then the lout flew at me. He hit my fist a tremendous blow with his\r\nlower jaw, the result of which was, that he immediately took the world on\r\nhis back, like old Atlas--he took the world on his back several times\r\nbefore he seemed tired of it. Then I gave him to understand, that by way\r\nof recompense for knocking him down, I should at once find a policeman to\r\ntake him up, unless he immediately accompanied me to a neighbouring\r\nkilling-house, to get a butcher to slaughter the sheep. He reluctantly\r\nconsented, and the sorrows of those two dumb creatures soon came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAbout the commonest, if not the simplest form of cruelty to poor pussy, is\r\nthat of neglecting to feed her regularly, and at the proper times. Many\r\npeople are guilty of this who would not willingly do an unkind action;\r\nthey err through ignorance, or want of thought. Pussy, they imagine, can\r\neasily pick up all she needs about the floor. There could hardly be a\r\ngreater mistake, or one more fatal to pussy's existence as a pet. For the\r\nmere fact of her having to look out for her own food will make her\r\ndishonest. Others starve their cats to make them catch mice; the very\r\nopposite is the case. It is your plump, well-fed, sleek grimalkins that\r\nare the best mousers; a starveling has not courage nor heart enough to\r\nkill a midge, let alone a mouse.\r\n\r\nHigher in the scale of cruelty is the only too common practice of leaving\r\npussy at home to shift for herself, when the family moves to the seaside\r\nor country, in holiday season. In some instances the cat has access to and\r\nfrom the house, by some private door of her own. In this case, she will\r\ngenerally manage to eke out a miserable existence, from the scraps she\r\npicks up on the dung-hill; or she will become a thief, and make raids on\r\nthe pigeon-houses or rabbit-boxes of the neighbours. At all events she is\r\nusually successful in sustaining her life, until the return of the family.\r\nBut it is very different with pussy, when she is entirely imprisoned in an\r\nempty house, without either food or water, save perhaps an occasional\r\nmouse which chance may throw in her way.\r\n\r\nI know of one unhappy cat that lived for three whole weeks, on dry\r\noat-meal alone.\r\n\r\nAnother instance I can just recall to memory, and I am sorry to say, it is\r\nonly one of many thousands that are happening every day. In this case, the\r\nfamily had gone to the country for a month, leaving Tabby--as\r\naffectionate a little cat as ever lived, and the constant pet and playmate\r\nof the young children--shut up in the house. The building was a new one;\r\nthere were consequently no mice; so, when the family at length returned,\r\nalmost the first thing that met their gaze was poor Tabby, lying stark and\r\nstiff on the parlour hearth. She was a perfect skeleton, while the\r\nsardonic grin on her mouth showed how much she must have suffered. Such a\r\ndeath, in that lonely house, almost makes one's flesh creep to think of.\r\n\r\nA still more shocking case of cruelty recently came to my knowledge, which\r\nshows very forcibly how dreadful must be the sufferings of a starving cat,\r\nand how great the sin of those who leave them thus to perish. In one of\r\nthe principal squares of the city of Edinburgh lives Mrs. Blank, a lady\r\nwho can carry a high head, in the best society of which the Scottish\r\nmetropolis can boast. She subscribes to all the charities, and feeds and\r\nclothes the poor daily; of course she is only \"lending to the Lord,\" and\r\nexpects the principal returned on or after the Day of Judgment, with very\r\ngood interest. But that is neither here nor there. This lady had a cat, a\r\nvery fine one too, on which she lavished an unusual amount of affection;\r\nand this affection was amply reciprocated, for pussy cared for no one in\r\nthe house but her mistress. But in process of time, Jenny had the\r\nexceedingly bad taste to give birth to two pretty little kittens, and of\r\ncourse could not spare so much time as usual on her mistress's lap. So,\r\nwhen the family had packed up, and were about to move into the country for\r\nthe holiday, this lady gave the order to have \"that horrid tiresome old\r\ncat and kittens shut up in the house,\" until her return. Pussy was shut up\r\naccordingly. For a whole fortnight after, the people in the adjoining\r\nhouse were disturbed by melancholy cries, proceeding from the empty house,\r\nand, at last, unable to endure it any longer; the assistance of the police\r\nwas called, and an entrance effected through a back window. A most\r\nhorrible sight met their view. Poor pussy, thin even to emaciation, lay\r\nupon her bed in the corner, _nursing the heads of her two kittens_. She\r\nhad eaten their bodies. Fancy the sufferings that must have triumphed\r\nover her motherly love. Not only, however, had she eaten the kittens; but,\r\nrendered wild by the pangs of hunger, she had actually torn from her own\r\nthigh a large piece of flesh, and devoured it. It is a wonderful instance\r\nof the tenacity of life in cats, that this pussy, by careful nursing, made\r\na good recovery. She took up house with her kind preservers, but never\r\nafterwards darkened the door of her cruel lady mistress. (_See Note N,\r\nAddenda._)\r\n\r\nThe sagacity of the cat is very often beautifully shown, in the means she\r\ntakes to provide for herself food and shelter, in the absence of her\r\nowners. On these occasions pussy has often been known to become a \"beggar\r\nfrom door to door.\" For example, one morning early, a workman,--Mr. D.\r\nStoddart, 92, Rose Street, Edinburgh,--on going to his work, observed a\r\nlarge black cat, trotting on before him, with tail erect and evidently on\r\nthe best of terms with herself. Her good-humour, however, must have been\r\nsimulated for the occasion, for she was very hungry indeed. Presently,\r\nshe stopped and looking earnestly in the man's face, all her happiness\r\nseemed at once to forsake her and she mewed in a most pitiful manner. The\r\ngood-hearted fellow at once opened his little napkin, and gave pussy part\r\nof his dinner. He was rather surprised next morning, to meet the puss\r\nexactly at the same time and place. In fact, the cat had adopted the\r\nworking-man in a small way; and every morning regularly, for six months,\r\nit met him and gratefully received its breakfast. After this, it used to\r\nwalk along with him for some distance, singing a little song to him the\r\nwhile, then took her departure. One day, however, pussy was missed, and it\r\nwas a long time before anything else was heard of her. Some months after,\r\nin passing a gentleman's gate, in a different part of the town, who should\r\ncome out to bid him welcome, but his quondam friend and companion the cat.\r\nShe was sleek and fat, and apparently happy as the sunshine. On making\r\ninquiries, it afterwards transpired that during the six months that pussy\r\nused to meet the working-man, the family were on the Continent.\r\n\r\nSo common a thing has cruelty towards the feline race become, that one can\r\nhardly take a walk along the streets, or into the country, without seeing\r\nthe mangled body of some poor puss, which has been stoned, beaten to\r\ndeath, or worried by dogs, more than likely in the open light of day.\r\nIndeed, a cat's foes are so very numerous, that the only wonder is, how\r\nshe escapes with her life so often. Instead of nine lives, it would I\r\nthink, be more convenient for her to have ninety and nine. Most common\r\namong pussy's numerous enemies may be mentioned,--\r\n\r\n_Firstly, Gamekeepers._ It must certainly be very annoying to keepers, to\r\nhave cats prowling indiscriminately among the preserves, destroying eggs,\r\nbirds, rabbits, and game of every description; but, after all, the amount\r\nof injury done must be comparatively small; whereas the cruelties\r\npractised on pussy by these men are at times quite revolting. To kill a\r\ncat by shooting her, may under some circumstances be deemed justifiable;\r\nbut to wilfully lay traps for its destruction, in which the poor thing may\r\nlinger for days, before death ends its misery, is surely far from humane.\r\nEven after pussy is relieved from the trap, it is, in most cases, only to\r\nhave her brains dashed out against the nearest tree, or to have her tail\r\ncut off, and her body left to die on the ground.\r\n\r\n_Secondly, Street-boys._ Seldom can a boy see a cat anywhere, on the\r\nstreet or at large, without lifting the nearest stone to shy at her. And\r\nnot boys only, but even grown-up men, have I heard boasting of their vile\r\nexploits in cat-killing.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly, Men with dogs._ \"The only way I like to see a cat,\" said a\r\ngentleman to me the other day, \"is with a dog at her heels;\" and, I'm\r\nsorry to say, such sentiments are far from unfrequent. I know, indeed, it\r\nis an usual thing for young men to go out of an evening with\r\ndogs--generally bull-and-terriers--for the express purpose, of slipping\r\nthem at the first cat that chance throws in their way. In these cases any\r\nhope of escaping with her life, is for the poor cat very small indeed,\r\nunless under very exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe other day, a friend of mine, who isn't very soft-hearted, was taking a\r\nwalk in the suburbs of Manchester, with a bull-terrier dog and a bitch of\r\nthe same breed--both champion prize-takers, by the way. A cat was started,\r\nand pussy made directly for the door of her master's house. Both the back\r\nand front doors were open. The cat darted in by the back, closely followed\r\nby the dog; while, as if to cut off all chance of escape, the bitch rushed\r\nround and entered by the front. The family were just at breakfast, when\r\npussy sprang on the table, attacked simultaneously in front and rear by\r\nher canine foes. They literally _tore her in two_ across the table, and\r\nbefore her owner's eyes. Of course the damage done to the crockery, was\r\nsomething very considerable, and my friend had to pay five guineas to hush\r\nthe matter up; and \"Serve you right,\" I remarked when he told me. (_See\r\nNote O, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nAnd _fourthly, Cat-skin Collectors_. In nearly every large town in the\r\nkingdom, there actually exist parties who make a living by buying cats\r\nfor the sake of their hides. They of course have to pay a pretty large\r\nprice for a good skin; and this in its turn gives rise to another branch\r\nof industry, namely, cat-hunting. The cat-hunter is lower in the social\r\nscale, and much more cruel and hardened, than even the bird-catcher. The\r\noccupation seems to be thoroughly demoralizing; and its followers live in\r\nthe most squalid dens and infamous purlieus of the city, leading an idle,\r\ndissipated life; and, if not dead of disease before the age of\r\ntwenty-five, it is because a grateful country has provided them with board\r\nand lodging free, at stony Portland or muddy Chatham.\r\n\r\nChance took me, not long since, to a beautiful rural district in one of\r\nthe southern counties of Ireland. Paddy Taffy, as he was called, from, as\r\nhe himself expressed it, his \"mother being a Welshman, and his father\r\nIrish,\" was a farmer's lad, and used to bring me the most beautiful\r\nbutter-milk, and the freshest of duck eggs every morning, as certain as\r\nsunrise. He was just the right boy in the right place; he knew every\r\nrock, and bog, and corrie in the parish, besides all the most frequented\r\nrabbit hills, and the pools where the fish were never shy. He was always\r\ncatering for fun for me, and was never so happy as when he had found me a\r\nnew pleasure. Well, one day, Paddy Taffy comes to me with the eggs and\r\nbutter-milk as usual; and, grinning like a grampus, \"Augh! sir,\" says he,\r\n\"but it's the raal bit of fun yer honour will be having this blessed\r\nmorning, if you'll only be after coming to the river with Taffy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I will that, Paddy,\" says I; for I had nothing better to do.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go home first though,\" says he, \"and then meet you at the side of\r\nthe strame.\"\r\n\r\nA walk of two miles over the hills took me to the place of appointment. I\r\nforgot to say, that Paddy was never unaccompanied by two dogs, one a very\r\ndecent well-bred water spaniel, the other a funny-looking frolicsome imp\r\nof a colley. On this day, when I met him, he had the dogs as usual, and\r\nmoreover, what in all the world should he be carrying under his arm, but\r\na butter-tub. Before I had time to inquire the use of the singular\r\nutensil--singular under the circumstances,--\r\n\r\n\"It's meself,\" says Paddy, \"that's glad you've come, and by the same\r\ntoken, yonder come the boys with the cat.\"\r\n\r\nOn looking round, sure enough, there were three more boys--of course\r\n\"boys\" is a mere figure of speech, they were all, including Paddy himself,\r\ngrown-up men--with three more dogs, one of which, a large white-and-black\r\nNewfoundland, carried a basket in his teeth. Suspecting that some scene of\r\nmischief or cruelty was to be enacted, I asked Paddy to tell me, right\r\nstraight away, what the game was to be. \"Sure your honour,\" said he, \"it's\r\nonly this:--we put the cat in the tub, and float her down the strame, and\r\nsend the dogs ahint her.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that I tried to persuade Paddy to give up a scheme which\r\nseemed to me little short of diabolical; for I fully expected to see poor\r\npussy torn limb from limb in the water. Paddy's reasoning was something\r\nafter the following fashion:--\r\n\r\n\"If it's the dogs you're afraid of, sir, sure enough they'll deserve all\r\nthey'll get, and more; if it's the cat, then you needn't be afraid at all,\r\nshe's been three times at it before. Och! she's the raal taring\r\nblood-and-wounding captain of the butter-boat; besides, she has kittens at\r\nhome, and that makes her the devil himself, sure. Moreover, sir,\"--here he\r\nlowered his voice; \"the boys is ugly boys, and they've ugly bits of timber\r\nbelow their flippers, and they wouldn't let us spoil the sport for the\r\ndear life itself.\"\r\n\r\nSo, making a virtue of necessity, I stopped to see the fun and fair play.\r\n\r\nThe river here was broad, and still, and deep. The basket was taken from\r\nthe Newfoundland, and all the dogs were led out of sight behind an\r\nadjoining hillock. Then the cat--a wild-looking tortoise-shell--was taken\r\nout, placed in the tub, and the tub shoved well off into the stream. Away\r\nwent puss with the current, whirling round and round in her awkward boat,\r\nand looking anything but happy, for she evidently knew all about it. Then\r\na shout from the boys; and down rushed the dogs helter-skelter, taking the\r\nwater in grand style, the spaniel first, the Newfoundland following,\r\nspringing right on top of the foremost dog, and sinking him by way of a\r\nlark. Up they all swam to the tub, which was still whirling slowly down\r\nstream; but puss was all ready, and stood by cleverly to repel boarders,\r\nevidently determined to sell her nine lives dearly. The spaniel was the\r\nfirst to place a paw on the tub; and his nose was at once laid open in\r\nconsequence. The colley followed suit, and sung small immediately after.\r\nThe other dogs had no better success; for each in his turn, and sometimes\r\ntwo at a time, were wounded, and had to haul off and lie too. _Tableaux_:\r\nfour defeated curs, paddling harmlessly round the tub, barking futilely;\r\npuss erect and frizzly, with one paw impressively uplifted, growling\r\ndefiance at the lot. All this time, the big Newfoundland had been swimming\r\nabout, taking apparently no notice of the unequal contest. Now, however,\r\nhe seemed to think the state of affairs justified his interference, in\r\norder to uphold the prestige of the canine race. Poor dog, he at least had\r\nno intention of killing the cat; but only thought of hauling her, tub and\r\nall, safely in shore. With this kind intention, and in that thoroughly\r\nbusiness-like manner only to be seen in dogs of his class, he paddled\r\ndirectly up to the vessel, and seizing it by the rim almost lifted it out\r\nof the water, as he put about with tail hard a-port to swim to land. Sharp\r\nand condign was the punishment Captain Puss administered to that dog's\r\nnose, for his unasked-for aid. Nelson dropped the tub like a red-hot shot;\r\nand with a howl of injured innocence, wheeled round and set out for land\r\nin disgust. But puss had no idea of letting him off like this; for the\r\nvessel, rather leaky at the best, had been filling for some time and was\r\nfast settling down; and pussy saw at a glance it must be abandoned. Then\r\nwhat better refuge, than to make a life-boat of that Newfoundland's head\r\nand shoulders? They just seemed cut out for it, so she didn't think twice\r\nabout it, but at once made the spring. If poor Nelson swam quick before,\r\nhe now seemed to cleave the water like a new-born steam-boat. Pussy,\r\nhowever, had no intention of letting him land with her, being doubtful as\r\nto the consequences; accordingly, when only a few feet more of water had\r\nto be passed, with one good parting kick, she sprang nimbly to bank, and\r\nmade off for the woods as fast as four legs could carry her. The dogs all\r\nlooked very foolish; and presently, like true Paddies, they all fell foul\r\nof each other, and fought in the water and out of the water, to their\r\nheart's content. (_See Note P, Addenda._) On the whole, I think pussy had\r\nthe best of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY PROTECTION FOR THE DOMESTIC CAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, after reading the chapter on cruelty to cats, surely every honest man\r\nand kind-hearted lady in the land will agree with me in thinking, that it\r\nis high time our Legislature should do something to put an end to the\r\npersecutions against, and to protect, our very useful pet pussy. Laws have\r\nbeen framed for the good of horses, dogs, and game; nay, even the very\r\nwild birds of the field have their friends in Parliament; but the poor cat\r\nis left out in the cold.\r\n\r\nIn the columns of a paper called _The Bazaar_, a few months ago, a\r\ncorrespondence was kept up for several weeks on the subject of \"Cat\r\nExtermination.\" No doubt it is highly annoying to have one's beautiful\r\nflower-beds torn up, and one's pet pigeons and rabbits worried at night by\r\nprowling cats. But the methods proposed for their destruction were in\r\nsome cases diabolical. Poison of all sorts was to be freely used, and\r\nsponges dipped in tallow--worse torture than giving a shark a red-hot\r\nbrick, or a lady's steel crinoline fastened up with hide--and wire fences,\r\nso constructed that the cat might find easy access into a garden, but no\r\negress, and so be torn to pieces with dogs,\r\n\r\n  \"With mair o' horrible and awfu',\r\n   Which e'en to name would be unlawfu'.\"\r\n\r\nBut I would fain enlist even these men on pussy's side; not certainly for\r\nsake of the cats, but for their own comfort; for no good--unless the\r\ngratification of a feeling of revenge--can accrue from attempts at\r\nextermination, and only from legislation can they hope to get redress. You\r\nmay exterminate the Modoc Indians, extirpate the Maories, and annihilate\r\nthe Ashantees, but you'll have no chance against the cats. Now, I should\r\nask, nay, claim, parliamentary protection for our domestic cat, for many\r\nreasons. Here I shall only mention one or two. First then, because she is\r\na _pet_--a pet in many a nobleman's and gentleman's family, and still\r\nmore so at many a poor man's fireside, who cannot afford to maintain any\r\nlarger domestic animal; and because pussy is so _beautiful_, so _gentle_,\r\n_loving_, and _kind_, and capable of such high training; because she is so\r\naffectionate towards her owner; and because _she loves the children so_.\r\nShe is, indeed, the pet _par excellence_ of babyhood and infancy.\r\nSecondly, because we are Christians, or live in a Christian land; and\r\nbecause the cruelties that are practised every day in our midst, against\r\nthis defenceless creature are harrowing to all our feelings, and a\r\ndisgrace to a civilized country.\r\n\r\nThirdly, and lastly _at present_, because the cat is an animal of great\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nPutting aside, then, all sentimentality, let us look at the matter in a\r\nplain business point of view.\r\n\r\nWe ought to do all in our power for the protection and improvement, of\r\nevery domesticated animal under our care, whether kept for use or\r\nornament; no one will think of denying that. But, there is no creature\r\nunder the sun which is so systematically ill-used, and carelessly treated\r\nas pussy. The cause is easily understood: we do not thoroughly appreciate\r\nthe good the cat does, and, even if we do, being all naturally selfish, we\r\nlike to have and hold all we can, for the least possible outlay and\r\ntrouble. Thus, pussy's services are poorly repaid and ungratefully\r\nreceived, because she is so patient and uncomplaining. If horses or other\r\ncattle were treated in like manner, they would quickly deteriorate in\r\nvalue; but the cat, looked upon as a mere vermin-killer, is different, her\r\npresence alone, however skinny and lean, being generally enough to\r\nfrighten away those pests, rats and mice. Indeed, very few of us, I fear,\r\nfully appreciate the amount of real good done, or the large amount of\r\nvaluable property saved annually--in a preventive way alone--by cats. More\r\nquickly than almost any other animal, do rats and mice multiply. Take the\r\nfield-mouse for example (the _mus leacopus_ or the _mus sylvaticus_), with\r\nthe nests of which nearly every school-boy is familiar,--\r\n\r\n  \"Those wee bit heaps o' straw and stubble,\r\n   That cost them mony a weary nibble.\"\r\n\r\nThese creatures breed at least four or five times a year; and you seldom\r\nfind fewer than seven little baby-mice in each nest. The mischief these\r\ncreatures sometimes work in grass fields, and in fields of newly-sown\r\ngrain, is almost incalculable. Whole acres have been known to be destroyed\r\nin a single night. Cats are the greatest enemies these creatures have:\r\nthey destroy them young and old, by the dozen, for mere sport--they seldom\r\ncare to eat them.\r\n\r\nIn-doors, again, what would the baker, the miller, the draper, the grocer,\r\nor even the bookseller do, without his cat?\r\n\r\nThere is no prettier ornament, I think, a shop-window can have, than an\r\nhonest-looking sleek Tom tabby.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" a hosier said to me the other day; \"I do like my cat. I shan't\r\ntell you, because you could not be expected to believe it, not being a\r\nbusiness man, how much money I lost two years ago in one winter, by rats\r\nalone. I tried everything, traps and poison, in vain, and was forced to\r\nfall back on pussy after all.\"\r\n\r\nA Scotch miller, plagued with rats, and hearing that music would frighten\r\nthem away, hired a couple of Highland bag-pipers to play in the mill for\r\ntwo whole nights. (_See Note Q, Addenda._)\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"the lads and lasses gathered from every corner, and\r\nit cost me oceans o' whisky; but those rats kent good music, I verily\r\nbelieve they danced to it. So, failing that, I got twa kittens; and three\r\nweeks after, I hadn't a rat about the place.\"\r\n\r\nBut looking at the matter statistically: it is the very lowest average to\r\nsay that every cat in this country does away with twenty mice or rats per\r\nannum; and, also, on the lowest average, each mouse or rat will destroy\r\none pound's worth of property a year. Well, there are, in the British\r\nIslands, over 4,000,000 cats; that, multiplied by 20, gives an annual\r\nsaving of £80,000,000 worth of property; and those cats do not take\r\n£4,000,000 to keep them alive, not more--at any rate.\r\n\r\nSurely, then, so useful a friend to man ought to be protected by law.\r\nUntil, however, the Legislature deems it fit to do something for her, I\r\nthink it behoves the public in general, and owners of pets and\r\ncat-fanciers in particular, to do everything they can to check cruelty to\r\ncats, and try to make her life a more comfortable and endurable one. Pussy\r\nis very easily kept, and I would, in the name of common humanity,\r\nearnestly beseech my readers to try the effect of kindness and regular\r\nfeeding on the cats they may own, and see how soon it will amply repay\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Cat shows_ ought to receive more encouragement than they do at present.\r\nNothing can be better calculated both to foster a love for these beautiful\r\ncreatures, and increase and perfect the different breeds, than those\r\ninteresting exhibitions. At present, only a very few of our leading\r\naristocracy, and gentry patronize cat shows. But they are every day\r\nbecoming more and more popular. Birmingham has emulated the Crystal\r\nPalace, and Edinburgh rivals both; and, before very long, I hope to see\r\nevery town, in the United Kingdom holding its annual show of cats.\r\n\r\nNow, every one I have spoken to on the subject, admits that something\r\nought to be done, by the Legislature, for the protection of the domestic\r\ncat. The difficulty seems to be where to begin, and _what sort_ of laws to\r\nframe. Begin, I say, by putting \"a stout heart to a stay brae\" (stiff\r\nhill), and we are sure to do some good.\r\n\r\nThe following hints are merely meant to be suggestive, and by no means of\r\na _ne plus ultra_ character. Indeed, _I should feel much obliged to my\r\nreaders, if they would kindly forward to me, their views on this subject_.\r\n\r\nThe law for the destruction of worthless dogs, found straying and begging\r\nin the streets, although at first blush it appeared a cruel one, was\r\nreally both humane and kind to the whole canine race. There were too many\r\nuseless curs without owners; and there are also Arab cats as well as Arab\r\ndogs--thousands on thousands, who never had a home and never will,\r\npreferring a nomadic life, because they never knew a better. How can we\r\nget rid of this surplus feline population? I would introduce a _cat\r\nlicence_. This licence, of course, should cost a mere nominal sum, what\r\nindeed even the poorest man who was able to afford food for a cat, could\r\neasily pay. The licences should be of two kinds, namely:--one for mere\r\nutility cats, and the other for valuable cats, household pets, etc. The\r\nfirst to cost one shilling and threepence, the other two shillings. A\r\ncat's collar to be presented to the owner on payment of the fee; the\r\ncollar stamped and numbered. The shilling licence collar to be dark; the\r\nother of coloured material. In the event of a cat being wantonly killed, a\r\nfine to be inflicted, of not more than £5 for the first class, and £10 for\r\nthe second class of licence. This would have a salutary effect in checking\r\nthe present trade of cat-skin hunting.\r\n\r\nA place would be required in every town, or district, where all cats found\r\nstraying without a collar could be taken, and if not claimed within three\r\nor four days, to be either sold, given away, or destroyed. Cats found\r\ndoing damage to gardens, poultry, rabbit warrens, or pigeon lofts, to be\r\ncaptured if possible, and the owners made to pay damages. All cases of\r\ncruelty to cats to be punished by fines, etc.\r\n\r\nStarving cats to be penal. I should have an inspector to visit every house\r\nonce or twice a year, and see that the cats were in good condition. The\r\nrevenue from this tax would be over £200,000 a year. I recommend it to the\r\nattention of Mr. Lowe.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few crude suggestions, which may be very much improved\r\nupon; one thing at least is certain, _the law ought to protect the\r\ndomestic cat_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFELINE AILMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, in one chapter--and that is all my available space--it will be\r\nimpossible to notice all, or even the greater part, of the evils that\r\nfeline flesh is heir to. I will endeavour, however, to lay down a few\r\nsimple rules for those who wish to keep their cats in health, and for\r\ntheir treatment in the most common diseases.\r\n\r\nPrevention is better than cure. I believe that is not an original remark;\r\nbut it is nevertheless a very true one, as regards the ailments of the\r\ndomestic cat, almost all of which may be kept at bay by even ordinary\r\nattention. We all have a duty to perform to the animals under us, even to\r\nanimals of mere utility; and much more cheerfully ought that duty to be\r\nperformed, if the creature is kept for the beauty that pleases our eye, or\r\nfor the love it loves us with. So long as your pet is in health, and\r\nhappy and lively, you can easily forgive yourself for many little acts of\r\nneglect towards her; but when she falls ill, when she is writhing in pain,\r\nand looking in your face with eyes that implore your aid, then, indeed, I\r\ndo not envy your feelings, if, coupled with your sorrow for her\r\nsufferings, you have the sad reflection that, many a time, you might have\r\nbeen better to her.\r\n\r\nThere is more room for improvement, in the breed and condition of the\r\ndomestic cat, than in that of any other animal I know; and no creature so\r\nsoon repays its master, for the care and attention he may bestow on it.\r\nInstead of the meagre-looking, small, short-haired, guilty thief, that\r\nused to fly and get up the chimney whenever it heard your footstep, you\r\nhave a large, honest, plump pussy, with glossy fur and loving eye, that\r\nruns to meet you with a song, and jumps on your shoulder to have the\r\npleasure of _giving_ you the first caress--a thing of joy and beauty\r\nfor----, well, for a matter of fifteen years at least. And these are the\r\nsort of cats I wish to see throughout the length and breadth of the land.\r\nI like to see people fond of their cats. Some will tell you it is unmanly\r\nto love a cat. Fudge! Man's manliness consists in doing, in a\r\nstraightforward manner, whatsoever is natural and right, and not fearing\r\nthe face of clay in the doing of it.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, the other day at Birmingham, somewhat mischievously\r\ninterrupting a sporting friend of mine, who was indulging in a long\r\ndiatribe on the comparative merits of two bull-terriers, \"But, have you\r\nseen the cats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound the cats!\" he answered testily, and, after a pause, \"D'ye know\r\nwhat I should like to do? Look, see. There are a hundred and twenty\r\nfox-terriers yonder; well, I'd just turn them into the cat show and close\r\nthe doors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, at all events,\" said I, \"come and see them.\" Arrived in the\r\nbuilding, my friend walked along the rows of cages, peeping into each with\r\nan air of amusing perplexity. At last he stopped before a beautiful\r\nPersian, and,--\r\n\r\n\"D--n it all,\" said he--his language was not very choice--\"these aren't\r\ncats, Doctor--they are some foreign beasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foreign only to bad treatment,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of it was, that I had to buy him a kitten--one of great\r\npromise. He took it away in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be good to it,\" he said; \"and when it's big, if it's game and all\r\nthat, I'll--look, see--I'll give it _a dozen rats every Sunday morning_,\r\nhang me if I don't.\"\r\n\r\nHe is a rough nut, my friend; but good at the kernel.\r\n\r\nIn order, then, to keep pussy in perfect health, pelage, and temper, and\r\nworthy of taking her place before the parlour fire, or on the drawing-room\r\ncouch, we must attend to three things, viz., her _food_, her _drink_, and\r\nher _housing_.\r\n\r\nFOOD.--I have no doubt that cats were originally admitted to the society\r\nof mankind, on account of their proclivities for killing rats and mice. We\r\ncan have some clue to the seeming mystery of the veneration, in which cats\r\nwere held in ancient Egypt, if we remember the large stores of grain,\r\netc., which its inhabitants were in the habit of laying up. No country in\r\nthe world depended more, for its very existence as a nation, on its\r\ncereals than did Egypt. We can imagine, then, a time when cats were\r\nunknown even to the Egyptians, and a particular year, when the crops had\r\nnearly failed, when the grain was hoarded carefully, and when, with\r\nfamine, came a plague of rats and mice, threatening death and annihilation\r\nto all in the land. We may easily fancy, the reign of terror and gloom\r\nthat would ensue; and then we can understand the exuberance of joy, and\r\ngeneral rejoicing on the introduction, by some Magi from a far country, of\r\ntheir new-found friend the cat. _A nation saved by cats!_ Something of the\r\nkind must undoubtedly have occurred; and thus the stringent laws framed\r\nfor pussy's protection, and the love and regard, lavished on her by all\r\nclasses of the people, may more easily be accounted for. We ourselves have\r\nalways had cats, since the conquest by the Romans, and can neither fully\r\nappreciate their value nor use; but think, reader, just for a moment,\r\nwhat the consequences would be, and how great the destruction of property\r\nby vermin, were cats to be suddenly exterminated. If then, only for the\r\nsake of making pussy more valuable as a vermin-killer, she ought to have\r\nregular and sufficient food. A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day.\r\nLet her have a dish to herself, put down to her, and removed when the meal\r\nis finished. Experience is the best teacher as regards the quantity of a\r\ncat's food, and in quality let it be varied. Oatmeal porridge and milk, or\r\nwhite bread steeped in warm milk, to which a little sugar has been added,\r\nare both excellent breakfasts for puss; and for dinner she must have an\r\nallowance of flesh. Boiled lights are better for her than horse-meat, and\r\noccasionally let her have fish. Teach your cat to wait patiently till she\r\nis served--a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child. If\r\nyou want to have your cat nice and clean, treat her now and then to a\r\nsquare inch of fresh butter. It not only acts as a gentle laxative, but,\r\nthe grease, combining in her mouth with the alkalinity of her saliva,\r\nforms a kind of natural cat-soap, and you will see she will immediately\r\ncommence washing herself, and become beautifully clean. (N.B.--If you wish\r\nto have a cat nicely done up for showing, touch her all over with a sponge\r\ndipped in fresh cream, when she licks herself the effect is wonderful.)\r\n\r\nRemember that too much flesh-meat, especially liver,--which ought only to\r\nbe given occasionally,--is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea\r\n(looseness). Do not give your pet too many tit-bits at table; but whatever\r\nelse you give her, never neglect to let her have her _two regular meals_.\r\n\r\nNever give a cat food in an _unwashed dish_.\r\n\r\nDRINK. It will save you a great deal of trouble, if you have a proper dish\r\nfor pussy's drink; and let it stand constantly in the same corner of the\r\nroom. It must be a double dish, that is, two saucers joined together, one\r\nfor _water_ and the other for _milk_; and remember, it must be carefully\r\ncleaned every morning, for a highly-bred cat will not drink milk, if it\r\nis the least unsavoury, nor water unless it is pure and free from dust. It\r\nperhaps is not very generally known, that cats nearly always prefer pure\r\nwater to milk, when they are really thirsty.\r\n\r\nA great treat for pussy, when she is a little bit seedy--of a morning,\r\nperhaps, after having been on the spree all night, and the best of cats\r\nwill go on the spree occasionally--is a saucer of nice creamy milk, made\r\nwarm with water, and slightly sweetened with sugar. It sets her all to\r\nrights straight away, and you will not find her ungrateful for such\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nHOUSING. It is not at all an uncommon practice, in some parts of the\r\ncountry, for people to turn their cats out at night, before they\r\nthemselves retire to rest. They do so, they will tell you, to prevent\r\npussy from misbehaving in the house. Now such a practice cannot be too\r\nseverely condemned. First and foremost, no well-trained cat, unless under\r\nthe most extreme circumstances, such as sudden illness, etc., will make\r\nany filth in the house where she resides; for, as I have said before,\r\nthere is no animal in the world more cleanly in its habits than the\r\ndomestic cat. Secondly, the practice of turning pussy out of doors at\r\nnight, is the very thing to engender filthy habits in her during the day.\r\nAnd lastly, people who treat their cats in this manner, are accountable,\r\nfor all the weight of crime, that falls upon pussy's shoulders.\r\nBadly-housed cats become vagrants and thieves, poor, starved-looking,\r\nbeggarly brutes, and adepts at all mischief, besides being unhealthy,\r\nugly, and filled with fleas. These are the cats that plunder pigeon lofts,\r\nsteal chickens, tear up beautiful flower-beds, and murder valuable rabbits\r\nin cold blood. They--\r\n\r\n  \"Sleep all day, and wake all night,\r\n   And keep the country round in fright.\"\r\n\r\nA cat that has been well fed and cared for by day, will seldom want to go\r\nout at night. If she does not feel sleepy, she will betake herself to the\r\ncellar, and have a little innocent flirtation with the mice or rats, or\r\nkill cock-roaches when everything else fails her.\r\n\r\nMake your pussy's bed on a couch or on the parlour sofa, or let her make\r\nit herself. _Apropos_ of making beds: the other night I was lying on the\r\nsofa, prior to turning into bed--I had lowered the gas and admitted the\r\nmoonlight--when Muffie entered, apparently in a great hurry to go to\r\nsleep. Seeing her master lying there, she placed her two forepaws on the\r\nsofa, and looking in my face,--\r\n\r\n\"Will you kindly get up out of that and let me lie down,\" she said,\r\nspeaking with her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Not till I'm ready; I'll see you hanged first,\" replied I, speaking with\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said pussy; and she went straight to the table, jumped\r\nup and pulled off the cloth, deliberately rolled herself in it, and went\r\nto sleep. She pulled down the ink along with it, and soiled the carpet,\r\nbut that was a matter for me and my landlady to settle between us; puss\r\ndid not care a rat.\r\n\r\nNever turn your cat out at night unless she asks to go.\r\n\r\nNever shut her up in a room all night, but let her have free access to\r\nkitchen or attic; you will thus have a healthy, cleanly puss, and never be\r\ntroubled with mice.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of medicine for a cat, and one which either in town or\r\ncountry they should never want, is _grass_. It is an excellent\r\nanti-scorbutic, keeps pussy's blood pure, and acts always as a gentle\r\nlaxative, and at times as an emetic, according to the quantity taken, and\r\nof this pussy herself is the best judge. In the country, a cat can always\r\nfind grass for herself, but in the town it ought to be given to her.\r\nPeople who are cat-fanciers, should never take a walk into the country,\r\nwithout culling a bunch of nice fresh grass for pussy. When you go home,\r\nthe best place to keep it will be the cellar, or lumber-room, to which\r\npussy has access, held fast by the ends between two flat stones or bricks,\r\na bit of wetted flannel being placed beneath the upper stone to keep the\r\ngrass fresh; and the cat will soon know where to go when she finds the\r\nneed for it.\r\n\r\nAlthough good and regular food, with proper attention, will generally\r\nsucceed in keeping your cats healthy, still these animals have many\r\ntroubles which call for medical aid. I give a very few of the commonest,\r\nwith the treatment appropriate for each.\r\n\r\n_Diarrhoea._ This, for obvious reasons, is a very troublesome complaint in\r\na cat. It is generally induced by irregular feeding, or exposure to wet\r\nand cold. Fat meat will also bring it on, or too much liver. It very soon\r\nreduces the creature to a mere skeleton, and if not attended to, will end\r\nin dysentery and death. Begin the treatment by giving the little patient\r\nhalf a small teaspoonful of castor-oil. Give a still smaller dose about\r\nsix hours after, to which two drops of laudanum or solution of muriate of\r\nmorphiæ has been added. Afterwards give, three times a day, either a\r\nlittle chalk mixture, with half a drop of laudanum in each dose, or a\r\nteaspoonful of the following mixture:--\r\n\r\n  [R.] Vin. Ipecac.       [dr] j.\r\n       Tinct. Kino        [dr] iij.\r\n       Decoct. Hæmatox    [oz] iv.\r\n\r\nGive no flesh diet; you may give the cat fish, however, in small\r\nquantities, and arrowroot with bread and milk. A few drops of solution of\r\nlime may be added to each diet with advantage.\r\n\r\nIn diarrhoea, and in all cases of severe illness, the cat should be turned\r\ninto an empty room, with a little fire, a warm bed and a box of earth or\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n_To give a cat medicine._ Roll her all but the head in a sheet, and get\r\nsome one to hold her. Do not alarm her if possible--mind your fingers--and\r\npour the medicine little by little down her throat. If a pill or bolus,\r\ndip it in oil, and put it well down and against _the roof of her mouth_.\r\n\r\n_Chronic inflammation of the stomach._ This is a frequent disease among\r\ncats. It often follows the administration of poison--supposing the cat to\r\nhave escaped immediate death. She refuses nearly all food, has frequent\r\nattacks of vomiting, gets thin and altogether unhealthy-looking, without\r\nany apparent cause. In these cases, I generally recommend the trisnitrate\r\nof bismuth, about a grain, to be placed on the tongue twice a day.\r\nOccasional doses of castor-oil or tincture of rhubarb, with milk diet and\r\nfish, and, if there be much wasting, raw beef may be given twice a day.\r\n\r\n_Bronchitis._--Cats are very subject to this complaint, as they are very\r\nliable to catch cold, especially if much exposed. It begins with the\r\nsymptoms of a common cold, such as staring coat, shivering, and slight\r\ncough. Then the cat becomes very ill, for a day or two, with the acute\r\nstage of the trouble, which, however, soon passes into the chronic form.\r\nThere is now apparent difficulty of breathing, the cat is constantly\r\ncoughing, with the tongue hanging over the lower lip; she has an anxious\r\nexpression about her face, and the eyes water and are mattery. She gets\r\nrapidly thinner, and moons about, refusing all food, or at times eating\r\nvoraciously, and with depraved appetite.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Begin by giving a simple dose of castor-oil, if no diarrhoea\r\npresent; if so, the dose to be combined with two drops of laudanum.\r\nConfine her to the house and feed her on beef-tea and bread, or\r\nmilk-arrowroot with beef-tea. If the disease becomes chronic, I know of no\r\nmedicine better than--\r\n\r\n  Extr. Conii\r\n  Pil. Scillæ Co. a a      gr. xv.\r\n\r\nmade into a bolus with sufficient bread-crumb; the bolus to be divided\r\ninto twenty pills, and one given every night. Keep up her strength, and\r\ncomplete the cure by a small tea-spoonful of cod-liver-oil twice a day for\r\na fortnight. This latter often acts like a charm. A certain form of\r\n\"mange\" often accompanies the disease.\r\n\r\n_Consumption._ This is not necessarily, although often, a lung-disease in\r\ncats. Whatever disease induces general wasting of the body, deterioration\r\nof pelage, an unhealthy state of the system, with refusal of, or distaste\r\nfor, food--if there be no bilious vomiting--may be called consumption.\r\n_The treatment_, which in most cases is successful, is regulation of diet,\r\ncareful housing and attention, raw meat in small quantities twice a day,\r\nand cod-liver-oil twice or thrice a day. Cod-liver-oil must be the sheet\r\nanchor in these cases; but if there is much cough, a little mixture like\r\nthe following will not fail to give relief,--\r\n\r\n  [R.] Tinct. Opii Camph.     [dr] j.\r\n       Syr. Scillæ            [dr] jss.\r\n       Sol. Mur. Morphiæ      m. x.\r\n       Aquæ cum Syrupo        ad. [oz] ij.--M.\r\n\r\nA teaspoonful occasionally.\r\n\r\n_Fits._ Cats are subject to various sorts of fits, delirious and\r\notherwise. The great thing is to give instant relief. Try first a common\r\nsmelling-salts bottle held to the nostrils, or a pinch of dry snuff; if\r\nthat does no good, pussy must be bled. I make a minute incision on the\r\nlower part of the ear behind, with a fine-pointed lancet, and then foment\r\nwith a sponge and hot water.\r\n\r\nThe after-treatment will depend much on the condition of the cat. If too\r\nfat or heavy, the diet must be lowered and regulated,--sheep's liver and\r\nmelt being given three times a week; if she is thin and emaciated, we must\r\ntrust to plenty of milk and raw meat, with cod-liver oil, with one-tenth\r\nof a grain of quinine, twice a day. If the cat be subject to fits the\r\nfollowing will be found useful:--\r\n\r\n  [R.] Bromid. Potass.    gr. x.\r\n       Iod. Potass.       gr. ijss.\r\n       Zinci. Sulph.      gr. iv.\r\n\r\nMix with bread-crumb to form twenty pills, and give one morning and night.\r\n\r\n_Mange._ I merely use this term because it is a handy one. Cats never have\r\nmange as found in the dog; but they have many kinds of skin diseases, both\r\npustular and scaly. They may all be treated in a similar manner. Attention\r\nto diet: let it be nourishing, moderate in quantity, and not heating. Let\r\nthe cat have plenty of exercise and free access to grass. A lotion of\r\ncarbolic acid may be used with advantage, not stronger than one part of\r\nthe acid to seventy of water. It must be _very_ carefully mixed, and\r\nwashed off again in two or three hours. Afterwards, an ointment of sulphur\r\nand hellebore may be used,--which any chemist will make for you,--and\r\narsenic must be given internally. The _liquor arsenicalis_ is the medicine\r\nto be used: drop six drops into an ounce bottle of water, and give pussy\r\none teaspoonful twice a day in her milk. There is no taste with the\r\nmedicine. Continue this for a fortnight, then omit for three days, and\r\nresume again until a cure is effected and the hair begins to grow again.\r\n\r\n_The Yellows._ This disease is often as fatal in the dog as in the cat. It\r\nis caused by derangement of the liver, and is most common in large overfed\r\ncats, which get little exercise. The disease is ushered in by general\r\nfeverishness, loss of appetite, and shivering. Sickness next comes on,\r\naccompanied by vomiting of a bright yellow, or dark green fluid, mixed\r\nwith froth. The vomiting continues, and is at times very distressing; and\r\ndiarrhoea and dysentery may supervene and cause death. If taken in time,\r\ngive her about half a small tea-spoonful of glauber salts, well diluted\r\nwith water. This, even if it should cause vomiting, will thereby do good\r\nby clearing the stomach; besides, the shock may tend to check the fever.\r\nIf the vomiting continues, try a pinch of white bismuth, placed on the\r\ntongue, or from one to three drops of laurel-leaf water; or, take one\r\ndrop of creasote, a few grains of aromatic powder, and sufficient fresh\r\nbread-crumb to form ten pills; and give one three times a day. Give, for\r\nfour or five nights half a grain of calomel on the tongue; and if much\r\ndiarrhoea is present, give her a grain of white bismuth three times a day,\r\nwith one or two drops of laudanum at night; and complete the cure by\r\ninfinitesimal doses of quinine, with cod-liver-oil and raw meat, if there\r\nbe much emaciation.\r\n\r\n_Dysentery._ This is a very serious complaint, and nearly always fatal. It\r\nis best treated by castor-oil to begin with; afterwards, minute doses of\r\nopium and ipecacuanha, with generous diet and occasionally a little port\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n_Milk Fever._ On no account should a cat's kittens be taken from her all\r\nat once. Indeed, one should always be left to be reared. In milk-fever the\r\npaps are swollen and painful, the secretion of milk is suppressed, and the\r\ncat is either highly excited--sometimes attempting to kill her kittens--or\r\ndull and stupid-like. A little bleeding will give relief if there is\r\ndelirium. The tits are to be well fomented with warm water, and a little\r\nwine given occasionally, with cream. Three or four drops of compound\r\ntincture of camphor, twice a day, will tend to allay irritability.\r\n\r\n_Inflammation_ of one or both eyes is not uncommon among cats, either\r\nthrough injury, or from cold. _Remedy_: A lotion of sulphate of zinc, two\r\ngrains to an ounce of water, or a few grains of common alum in warm water,\r\nas a fomentation, will generally effect a cure.\r\n\r\nFor _ulcers_ and _sores_ of external ears or cheeks, touch them\r\noccasionally with blue-stone, and apply--\r\n\r\n  [R.] Sulph. Zinci          gr. x.\r\n       Tinct. Lavandula      [dr] j.\r\n       Aquæ                  [oz] iv.\r\n\r\nIf they are very inveterate, they will only yield to red precipitate\r\nointment, and arsenic internally, as for mange.\r\n\r\nCats stand operations of all sorts well. If a cat's leg is broken and\r\nlacerated by a trap, cut it off. Don't be afraid. Only leave sufficient\r\nflesh to cover the bone, and have ready a strong red-hot wire, to\r\ncauterize and stop bleeding, then bring the flaps together by a needle and\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nMany cats die of apoplexy, many of paralysis. I have dissected some who\r\nhad well-marked softening of the brain. And many die in their sleep. As a\r\ngeneral rule, if your cat seems ailing, you can't do wrong to give her an\r\nemetic--try a little weak salt and water; or let her have fresh grass, and\r\neither a dose of castor-oil, or a very little grey powder.\r\n\r\nI have often seen cats' lives saved, by giving raw beef and cod-liver oil.\r\n\r\nWhen a cat is in bad health, either her stomach, bowels, liver, or\r\nkidneys, are out of order; and as a rule we can generally only conjecture\r\nwhich. A medicine, therefore, that acts, gently but effectively, on all\r\nthe organs would be a sort of specific for cats' complaints. In the \"Cat's\r\nMedicine Chest,\" advertised at the end of this book, I have placed a\r\nmedicament of this nature, which I have often prescribed with excellent\r\nresults. There is everything in that little box to make a Pussy well, and\r\nkeep her happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nODDS AND ENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my pet cat read the heading of this chapter, she sarcastically\r\nremarked,--\r\n\r\n\"Humph! I suppose you mean that cats tails are the 'ends'; but what's the\r\n'odds'?\"\r\n\r\nTheodore Nero raised his chin slightly from the carpet to add,--\r\n\r\n\"So long's you're happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You brute!\" said Muffie. \"You don't know what you're talking about; you\r\nalways are half asleep.\"\r\n\r\nBut touching cats' tails (it wouldn't be the best policy to touch every\r\ncat's tail however), a lady asked me seriously at dinner the other day,\r\n\"Why does a cat waggle its tail?\" Such a question at such a time was a\r\nposer, and, to comfort me, she added, that she really was asking for\r\ninformation. I answered, as Dundreary, \"Becauth a cat ith sthronger than\r\nits tail; if the tail wath the sthronger, the tail would waggle the cat.\"\r\n\r\nCats are extremely proud of their tails. Pulling a Jew's beard, and a\r\ncat's tail, are indignities of an equality. Doubtless, did mankind possess\r\nthese appendages, he would be equally jealous of their honour. But they\r\nhave been overlooked somehow in the outfitting. But just imagine how\r\ngingerly we gentlemen would use them! How elegantly we would carry them\r\nunder our arms while walking, and how we would flare up if any one trod on\r\nour tail! Imagine Paddy at a fair: \"Twelve o'clock, and no foight yet!\r\nWill any gintleman just spit on the point of my tail?\"\r\n\r\nHow useful, too, tails would be in many ways in riding, driving, or\r\nboating! On a rainy day, one's umbrella might be tied to it, so as to have\r\nboth hands free; and in mobs and crowds it could be worn out of sight. How\r\nhandy, to dig your neighbour in the ribs with, and say, \"Sly dog\"; or,\r\n\"Don't you see, don't you see?\" when you'd made a bad pun! How useful to\r\nthe orator, for elegant gesticulation, to give point to an argument, or\r\nto indicate derision. For example:--\r\n\r\n_Lord Chief Justice_: Did you poke your tail at me, sir?\r\n\r\n_Claimant_: No, my lord; I----\r\n\r\n_L. C. J._: Very well, sir; don't do it again--that's all.\r\n\r\nHow convenient the British sailor would find a tail, when aloft reefing\r\ntopsails; and, sure, wouldn't Jack also use it as a tobacco stopper? If\r\nmen had tails, the medical profession would be benefited thereby. There\r\nwould be several new diseases and new operations. How beautifully this\r\nwould sound, for instance: \"Compound comminuted fracture of the middle\r\nthird of caudal extremity;\" or, \"Amputation at the tenth caudal vertebra;\"\r\nwhich would give rise to advertisements like the following: \"Turner's\r\nCircular Splint,\" and \"Beautiful, easy-fitting Caudal Appendages, equal to\r\nNature; patronised by the illustrious Duke of Dunmore, whose tail was\r\ncarried away by a 500 pounder, at the battle of Dorking, during the\r\nfamous charge of the gallant London Scottish. Only _seven-and-six_!\"\r\n\r\nThe ends of justice, too, would be assisted. New laws would be added to\r\nthe penal code. Garotters would be condemned to \"Two years' imprisonment\r\nand deprivation of caudicity.\" Lesser offences punished by \"Six months,\r\nand six inches off tail.\" Thus we should easily know a rogue in the\r\nstreet, when we met one.\r\n\r\nI must stop. I feel I should warm to the subject; and one of such vast\r\nramifications ought to have more space for its consideration, than I can\r\nafford. However, to band-masters, acrobats, public-speakers, parsons,\r\npainters, and policemen, tails would indeed be invaluable; and, upon my\r\nhonour, when I come to think of it, I only wonder how human beings, have\r\ncome to be overlooked in this little matter.\r\n\r\nCats, it may be observed, wag their tails when pleased; when angry, they\r\nlash them; and, when excited, and about to spring on their prey, the tail\r\nquivers. This is all involuntary on the part of pussy, and is an index of\r\nthe state of her feelings, the tail being principally supplied with nerves\r\nfrom the spinal chord, and along this chord the nervous force is carried\r\nfrom the brain.\r\n\r\n_Why do cats always fall on their feet?_ This question is by no means\r\ndifficult to answer. When she first falls from a height, her back is\r\nlowermost, and she is bent in a semicircle. If she fell thus, fracture of\r\nthe spine, and death, would be the inevitable result. But natural instinct\r\ninduces her, after she has fallen a foot or two, to suddenly extend the\r\nmuscles of her back, and stretch her legs; the belly now becomes the\r\nconvexity, and the back concave, thus altering the centre of gravity, and\r\nbringing her round; then she has only to hold herself in this position in\r\norder to alight on her feet.\r\n\r\nOne day lately, a lady, who lives in the _fourth_ story of a house in\r\nDundee, hung the cage with the canary on a nail outside the window. The\r\ncat, from the inside, watched it for some time till, unable any longer to\r\nwithstand the temptation, she made a spring, and, somehow missing the\r\ncage, fell to the ground, some forty feet. But she alighted on her feet,\r\nand walked off as if nothing had occurred. (_See Note R, Addenda._)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCats are wonderfully sure footed. I saw a cat one day, taking an airing\r\nalong a housetop, where Blondin could hardly have walked without a pole.\r\nShe had a kitten in her mouth, too, to make her performance all the more\r\nentertaining. Another puss I saw sitting on an iron rail, a few feet from\r\nthe ground, and apparently fast asleep. The rail was only about one inch\r\nin diameter, and she sat there fully an hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVery few cats care to drink spirituous liquors. Dogs are not so\r\nparticular. One dog I had once, on board ship--a Labrador retriever--used\r\nto attend the call of \"Grog O!\" every day, and get his allowance along\r\nwith the men. He never got drunk though, and he showed his wisdom by\r\ntaking it well watered. I know a little bull-terrier bitch, who goes to a\r\nhotel every day she has a chance. Her favourite tipple is beer poured\r\nupon a salver. As she cannot speak, she sits in a chair and thinks a lot.\r\nAs she always meets plenty of friends willing to stand treat, she never\r\ncomes home sober. I saw her a few weeks ago, trying in vain to cross the\r\nstreet. At last she sat down in the middle, and barked to me. I was sorry\r\nto see a well-bred young lady in such a condition, so I helped her home,\r\nfor which she showed gratitude next day. (_See Note S, Addenda._)\r\n\r\nBut my father had a cat,--a big Tom, whom the servants used to make drunk\r\nat any time. His beverage was Scotch whiskey-brose, _i.e._, oatmeal and\r\nwhiskey; and I've seen him come staggering into the parlour and tumble\r\nover the leg of the table. Then he would fall asleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCats, as a rule, do not like music; although, if brought up in a musical\r\nfamily, they learn to tolerate it. A cat is easily taught to come when\r\nwhistled upon. A friend of mine has a cat, who, if he commences to whistle\r\na tune, immediately jumps on his breast, and rubs her head all over his\r\nface, as if trying to comfort him, having the notion, no doubt, that he is\r\nin some sort of anguish. But if he puts out his hand to take down his\r\nfiddle in her presence, she at once erects her back and tail, and growls\r\nat him, in unmistakable anger. However, in this she shows her good taste,\r\nfor her master is certainly the most execrable performer, that ever\r\ntickled hair on gut.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are many old superstitions regarding cats still extant, and many\r\nfoolish notions about them, that had much better be unlearned. Sailors\r\nbelieve, that, if the ship's cat be lost overboard, shipwreck, or some\r\nsuch disaster, is almost sure to follow. My own old captain, Commander\r\nMcH---- was imbued with this notion, hence his extreme care to retain the\r\nblack cat on board, as depicted in the tale, which follows this\r\nChapter--\"The Skipper's Imp.\"\r\n\r\nWitches are supposed by some to be constantly attended by an evil spirit,\r\nin the shape of a black cat.\r\n\r\nTo dream of cats is considered very unlucky. In some of the more\r\nunfrequented districts of Scotland, the good folks are still very careful\r\nto shut up their cats in the house, on Hallowe'en, _i.e._, the 31st of\r\nOctober. And they tell me, that those cats that have managed to escape\r\nincarceration, that night may be seen, by those brave enough to look,\r\nscampering over hill and dell, and across the lonely moors, each one\r\nridden by a brownie, a bogle, a spunkie, or some other infernal jockey, in\r\nfact, a devil's own steeplechase. And, they say, those cats never produce\r\nyoung again; or, if they do, the sooner the kittens are put out of sight\r\nthe better; they are subject to startings in their sleep--no wonder--have\r\na weird unearthly look about their eyes, and soon pine away, and die, and\r\ngo--we shudder to say whither.\r\n\r\nCats are supposed to be capital prognosticators of the weather. If a cat\r\nis seen washing her face with more than usual assiduity, it is going to be\r\nstormy; and if pussy sits much with her back to the fire, you may expect\r\nfrost and snow in winter, and thunder and lightning, with hail, in summer.\r\nSome portion of pussy's person seems, indeed, to retain the power of\r\nforetelling the weather, even after death, as witness that common toy,\r\nwhich poor people use instead of a barometer, a wee wee man, and a wee wee\r\nwoman, living together in a wee wee house; one of them pops out every day;\r\nif the day is to be fine, the lady comes, if not, like a loving wife, she\r\nsends her good man out--the secret is, the little couple are suspended on\r\ncatgut, which twists or untwists according to the state of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-HAIRED BLACK.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by MISS ARMITAGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANX.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by P. WILLIAMS, ESQ.]\r\n\r\nThere is a very common popular fallacy, regarding cats sucking an infant's\r\nbreath, and killing it. The idea is simply preposterous. Cats, being\r\nextremely fond of children, naturally like to get into the cradle, to lie\r\nbeside, and watch them. They often crouch upon the child's breast; this\r\nmay impede breathing more or less, according to the relative size of the\r\ncat to the baby. If the cat actually sits upon the child's face, then\r\nindeed the poor creature may be suffocated. But such an occurrence is\r\nso very rare, that it is hardly worth mentioning. Many more deaths occur\r\nfrom bad arrangement of a baby's pillow, in which case the mother must be\r\nglad when there is a cat to put the blame upon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCats have any amount of wiliness about them. A dog would scarcely think of\r\nhiding below a bush until its prey came within reach; but cats are adepts\r\nat an ambuscade. A cat knows by experience that a bird--say a\r\nsparrow--looks almost in every direction, saving directly beneath it, and\r\nso pussy always steals a march on it, from below. If a bird is foolish\r\nenough to alight on the top of a clothes-pole, pussy has a very easy\r\nvictory. It is that same habit of never looking downwards, which causes\r\nthose large birds, which alight on a ship's yards at sea, to be so easily\r\ncaptured by the sailors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstances of jealousy are by no means uncommon in the feline race.\r\nJealousy is an indication of a sensitive nature, and no animal in the\r\nworld is more sensitive than a cat. A lady had a pretty little pussy,\r\nwhich she had saved from drowning. This cat was excessively fond of its\r\nmistress, was never absent from her while in the house, and outside used\r\nto follow her like a dog. But in course of time, this lady bought a\r\nparrot, and pussy must have thought her mistress was paying the bird too\r\nmuch attention, for all of a sudden the cat's nature seemed entirely\r\nchanged. It did not respond to the lady's caresses; it would sit for an\r\nhour at the time, looking with gathered brows at the parrot, and instead\r\nof accompanying her mistress abroad she remained sulking in doors. In\r\ntruth, the cat was breaking her heart; her glossy fur got dry and rough,\r\nand at last she refused all food; so, as she really loved her cat, this\r\nlady parted with her parrot, although with great reluctance. Pussy\r\nrecovered at once; the effect seemed magical; and in a few days she was\r\nherself again, the same fun-loving, frolicsome, loving wee cat she had\r\nbeen before.\r\n\r\nA gentleman had a cat whom he called \"Pimento\"--the pimento-tree, the\r\nreader will remember, is said to permit no rival plant to grow within its\r\nshade. There was another cat in the same house; but Pimento, although\r\notherwise a nice cat, and gentle and loving in the extreme, would never\r\nallow his master to pay the slightest attention to this cat. If he did,\r\nthere was a row at once; and if his master protected the other cat, then\r\nPimento at once left the room growling, and in high dudgeon. (_See Note T,\r\nAddenda._)\r\n\r\n\"In a house where I resided,\" says a correspondent (_see Note U,\r\nAddenda_), \"there were two cats, a young and an old one. The young one was\r\na smart clever animal with a decided turn for humour, the other liked to\r\nbe taken notice of. One day I was paying some attention to the latter,\r\nwhich, of course, was highly pleased. With tail erect, it walked backward\r\nand forward. The young one, which had been pretending to be asleep,\r\nsuddenly seized hold of the tail of the other with its paw, gave it a\r\nsharp pull, and was again in a sleeping attitude ere the other had time\r\nto look round. The old one turned about, saw the young one apparently\r\nasleep, and me laughing. It immediately retired to a corner of the room,\r\nthinking no doubt that I was a double villain.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDid the reader ever observe how very fond cats are of sitting on paper.\r\nOne can hardly have a pet puss, and not observe this trait. If you have a\r\nbook in your lap, up jumps Pussy, and seats herself right on top of it. If\r\nyou are writing a letter, Pussy creeps along the table, singing so that\r\nyou can hardly be angry with her, and places herself on the writing\r\nmaterials. My present puss prefers the _Daily Telegraph_ to anything else\r\nfor a bed at night, or to have her kittens on; indeed, if the _Standard_\r\nis lying on the same sofa, and she gets on to it by mistake, she will very\r\nsoon get off, and on to the _Telegraph_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAre cats revengeful? Never as a rule. Yet they do sometimes display little\r\npettish outbursts of temper. They would not be like women if they did not\r\ndo that.\r\n\r\nA lady tells me that when she is writing, her cat will sometimes come and\r\nplant herself right in the way, and when gently pushed off, she suddenly\r\nloses her temper, and pitches the writing materials right and left on to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote is highly illustrative of the kind and quantity of\r\npussy's revenge:--\r\n\r\n\"Now for the story of the cat; she was a lovely black and white Kâbul cat\r\n(the same as Persian) with hair like floss silk, as long as one's finger;\r\nand as wise--as a great many human beings. She had a great dislike to\r\nroast mutton cold, and when I had nothing else to offer her, her\r\nresentment was most marked: she refused my caresses, and walked straight\r\noff to my dressing-room, where on the top of the chest of drawers stood my\r\nbonnet-box. She jumped up and administered slaps to the box, until it fell\r\non the floor, when she would come away at once, her revenge being\r\ngratified. This occurred on several occasions, and only when she was\r\noffered a cold mutton dinner. Was not the knowledge of what would\r\ndistress my feminine feelings a wonderful piece of intelligence? We quite\r\nlooked out for it after the first few times, and would watch her walking\r\noff to my room, and then in a minute or two there would be 'bump, bump,'\r\nand my husband would say, 'There goes your bonnet!'\" (_See Note V,\r\nAddenda._)\r\n\r\nI only know one instance of what might be called revenge proper. It was a\r\nlarge black cat of the name of Imp. The poor fellow was exceedingly\r\nill-used by the servant maid, who used to beat him on every occasion\r\npossible. Imp's dislike to the girl was very great, although he evidently\r\nwas afraid to attack her, but one day this servant was coming downstairs\r\nwith a tray of dishes, and seeing both her hands full, Imp thought he\r\nought not to miss such a golden opportunity for retaliation. He\r\naccordingly flew at her, and scratched both her arms and face severely. So\r\nwe see that cats, although gentle and forgiving in the extreme to those\r\nwho love them, do not easily forget an injury from the hands of a\r\nstranger or cat-hater. (_See Note W, Addenda._)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reader must have often heard that cats seem to possess some wonderful\r\ninstinct which enables them to predict certain kinds of coming\r\ncalamities,--such as earthquakes, and different sorts of explosion.\r\nPersonally, I know one instance of this, although I cannot explain it,\r\nviz., our ship's cat taking to the rigging and sitting on the main-truck\r\n_before_ our vessel was discovered to be on fire. Another I have from my\r\ngrandfather--an officer in the 1st Royals at the time of the last\r\nAnglo-Franco war. My grandmother was bending down, taking something from a\r\nchest on the floor, when suddenly the whole window was blown to\r\nsplinters--dust almost--around her, with the thunder of some dreadful\r\nexplosion. It was a transport that had entered the harbour--Kiel, I\r\nthink--some days before, laden with war munitions, and which had blown up\r\nwith all hands. But it was remarked by every one on the quay, that the\r\nship's cat had been sitting all the morning of the explosion, on the\r\nvessel's main-truck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCats are sometimes very fond of horses. I know an instance of this where\r\nthe stable-cat was very much attached to a certain horse, and that animal\r\nevidently reciprocated the cat's kindly feelings. And Pussy used to stand\r\nquietly, and allow the horse to lick her fur _the wrong way_, and indeed\r\nseemed to enjoy it. (_See Note G, Addenda._)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe all know how proud Miss Puss is of her song. Barring a certain drowsy\r\nmonotony, which acts like a narcotic both on herself and kittens, and at\r\ntimes even on human beings, there isn't much melody in it, however. This\r\npower of singing becomes lost in sickness, and also in extreme old age. I\r\nknow of a cat, of very advanced years, that had given up singing for many\r\na day, until a kitten--a famous musician in its way--came to reside at her\r\nhouse. Then poor old Pussy tried hard to get out a bar or two, and her\r\nefforts to succeed were quite ludicrous. Being laughed at she flew into a\r\npassion, and put her spite out on the happy little kitten. The more this\r\nspirited pussy was thrashed however, the louder it sang; so the old cat\r\nleft the room in disgust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe days and years of a cat's life, are on an average fourteen, but many\r\nlive very much longer. Fifteen and seventeen are very common ages for\r\nPussy to die at. The longest time I have ever known a cat live, was till\r\nits twenty-second year, but I have heard of them dying at the age of\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is quite a common thing for a cat to feed itself with milk or cream, by\r\ndipping her forepaw in the jug, and then licking it. Pussy is very awkward\r\nat drinking water from a crystal tumbler. At first she will generally\r\nthrust her head too far in, which will make her sneeze; then she will sit\r\nand eye the glass for a time, as if considering how far the water comes\r\nup. Not content with ocular demonstration, she will next put a paw\r\ncautiously in, until the extreme end of her toes touches the water, and\r\nthus, after marking the distance, she can drink in comfort.\r\n\r\nA certain cat which had been reared on the spoon, used, when full-grown,\r\nto sit up on her hind-legs, and reaching down the spoon to her mouth with\r\nher paws, swallow the contents. The same cat used to drink milk, if poured\r\ninto her mouth from a jug, or any dish with a spout to it. So expert at\r\nthat trick did she become, that, sitting up as usual, she used to receive\r\nand swallow a continuous stream poured into her throat from a height of\r\nthree feet. (_See Note X, Addenda._)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the subject matter, of the remainder of this chapter, I am indebted to\r\na lady who takes a great interest in feline nature. (_See Note H,\r\nAddenda._)\r\n\r\n\"It is certain,\" she says, \"that cats have some strange instinct, that\r\nsends them, when lost or starving, to certain people. They have followed\r\nme in gay crowded streets, and met me in fields; I have gone into shops\r\nand bought milk and rolls for the starvelings; and have gone again to the\r\nsame place, and they were gone,--doubtless, cats on the tramp and\r\ndestitute. I have known a friend's cat lost for five days, and it never\r\nattempted to make its sorrows known, until I passed before the window of\r\nan underground room, when her shrieks were horrible to hear, and so\r\nprolonged, that the passers-by stopped to listen. I remained speaking to\r\nthe poor creature, whose claws were rattling against the shut door, until\r\nthe key was brought, and pussy set free.\"\r\n\r\nShe relates an instance of a young surgeon, who was on his way to join his\r\nship, to sail to the antipodes, and who was followed to the very boat by a\r\npretty little kitten. As it seemed bent on being a sailor, the surgeon put\r\nthe poor thing in his pocket. It was presented to a lady on board, who was\r\ninterested in its story, and is now doing duty among the cats of South\r\nAustralia,--a country, by the bye, where cats are more fully appreciated\r\nthan here.\r\n\r\nBeda was a beautiful blue tabby. One summer's morning, down in Devon, she\r\nhad been missed for hours, and on being called, a viper glided out from a\r\nthicket in the garden, closely followed by the cat. The snake--until\r\nkilled by a lady--kept moving off, but every moment turning round, and\r\nhissing at Beda, who, however, was in no ways put about. The following\r\nalso tends to show that cats have no fear of snakes:--\r\n\r\n\"At Artea, in the province of Orissa, a cobra had his den under a\r\nmulberry-tree, near a garden walk. One day our English tabby cat, Beda,\r\nhad been missing with all her kits for some hours. She was found at the\r\nfoot of the mulberry-tree, teaching her children to pat the cobra on the\r\nhead, every time he popped it out. When the head was protruded too far, a\r\nstroke from puss herself, caused its speedy withdrawal. Thinking the game\r\ndangerous, the cobra, which measured two inches in diameter, was dug out\r\nand killed. We were afterwards told by the natives, that no snake will\r\nkill a cat, as they dislike the fur.\"\r\n\r\nCats are like dogs, and generally have a favourite among the litter, the\r\nhandsomest. Once when Beda was nursing in India, a wild cat sprang in by\r\nthe open window, and tried to seize the kittens. Beda made off with her\r\npet, and the wild cat was beaten out. Beda, however, forgot where she had\r\nhidden the favourite, nor would she be consoled with the other members of\r\nher family. A search was accordingly made, and the pet kitten at last\r\nfound on a sofa, in an adjoining bungalo.\r\n\r\nThis lady's cat never attempted to touch the canary, nor indeed any birds\r\nabout the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO \"MUFFIES.\"--A TALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was yet a little school-boy, there came about my father's house\r\nand premises a plague of rats. They came in their thousands, as if\r\nsummoned by the trumpet-tones of a rodentine Bradlaugh or Odger. They took\r\nthe farm-yard and outhouses by storm, laid siege to the dwelling-house,\r\nand, from the thoroughly business-like manner they conducted their\r\noperations, and went into winter quarters, it was quite evident they\r\nmeditated a stay of some duration. Sappers and miners, or royal engineers,\r\nwere employed to drive tunnels and galleries under every floor, with\r\npassages leading to the grain-lofts above. Foraging parties were appointed\r\nto every stack of corn and rick of hay. The henhouse was laid under\r\ncontribution to furnish eggs and feathers, and black-mail was levied from\r\nthe very cows. The eaves of the well-thatched barns and byres were\r\napportioned to their wives, their aged, and infirm, while the poor\r\nsparrows were dislodged from their comfortable, well-lined nests to make\r\nroom for little naked baby rats; and so effectually was every department\r\nworked, and so well did every branch of the service do its duty, that\r\nCardwell himself, nay, even Bismarck, Moltke & Co., could not have\r\nsuggested anything in the way of improvement.\r\n\r\nAt all these doings my honest father looked very blue, and employed his\r\ntime principally in expending various sums of money in vermin-killers, and\r\nin reading works on toxicology. The result of his study was, that many\r\ntempting morsels and savoury tit-bits were placed in convenient corners,\r\nfor the benefit of the invaders. It seemed indeed for their benefit: they\r\ndidn't care a straw for tartar-emetic, appeared to get fat on arsenic,\r\nwhile strychnia only strengthened their nervous systems, and morphia made\r\nthem fierce.\r\n\r\nNow Gibbie was the house cat, a very large and beautiful red tabby. In his\r\nprime he had been a perfect Nimrod of the feline race. Scorning such\r\nfeeble game as the domestic mouse, his joy was to ramble free and\r\nunfettered among the woods and forests, by the loneliest spots at the\r\nriver's brink, and among the mountains and rocks; often prolonging his\r\nhunting excursions for days together, but never returning without a\r\nleveret or fine young rabbit. These fruits of the chase he did not always\r\nbring home, but often presented to his various human friends in the\r\nadjoining village; for Gibbie was known far and near, and even his\r\nlordship's surly old gamekeeper, though he raised his gun at the sight of\r\nthe cat, forbore to fire when he saw who the bold trespasser was. Many a\r\nrare and beautiful bird did Gibbie carry home alive, among others, I\r\nremember, a beautiful specimen of the corn-crake; nor can I forget\r\npussie's manifest disgust, when the bird was allowed to fly away. Just two\r\ndays after, he brought home a crow, but this time the head was wanting. By\r\nthe banks of the Denburn he one day fought and slew a large pole-cat; this\r\nhe carefully skinned, and dragged home. Gibbie was as well-known in the\r\ncountry-side as the witch-wife, or the pack-merchant, and more respected\r\nthan either; and people often came to our house to beg for \"ae nicht o'\r\nGibbie,\" as \"the rottens (rats) at their town (farm) were gettin' raither\r\nthrang and cheeky.\"\r\n\r\nThe loan was always granted.\r\n\r\n\"Gibbie, go,\" was all my mother would say, and off trotted puss by the\r\nparty's side, with his tail gaily on the perpendicular; for he knew, as\r\nwell as cat could, that rare sport and a rich treat of the sweetest cream,\r\nwould be the reward of his compliance.\r\n\r\nBut Gilbert did not confine himself to hunting only; he was an expert\r\nfisher. For hours he would watch at one spot on the banks of a river, with\r\nhis eyes riveted on the water, until some unhappy trout came out to bask\r\nin the sun's rays. This was Gibbie's opportunity. For a moment only his\r\nlips and tail quivered with extreme anxiety, then down, swift as Solan\r\ngoose, he had dived with aim unerring, and seized his finny prey, with\r\nwhich he came quietly to bank, and trotted off homewards, to enjoy the\r\ndelicious morsel in some quiet corner all to himself. Rabbits, hares, and\r\ngame of all kinds, Gibbie parted with freely; but a trout was a treat, and\r\nhe never shared it with man or mortal.\r\n\r\nBut Gibbie was now old. Nineteen summers had come and gone since he had\r\nsky-larked with his mother's tail, and his limbs had waxed stiff, and his\r\nonce bright eyes were dimmed. He seldom went to the woods now, and when he\r\ndid he returned sorrowfully and minus. He preferred to dose by the parlour\r\nfire, or nurse his rheumatism before the kitchen grate; and while nodding\r\nover the embers, many a scene, I warrant, of his earlier years came to his\r\nrecollection, and many a stirring adventure by flood and field stole\r\nvividly back to memory, and thus he'd fight his battles o'er again, and\r\nkill his rabbits thrice.\r\n\r\n\"Gibbie,\" said my father one day, thoughtfully removing his pipe from his\r\nmouth; \"Gibbie, you've got some game in you yet, old boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, aye,\" said Gibbie, for he was the pink of politeness, and never\r\nfailed to reply when civilly addressed.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued my father, \"you shall have a good supper, and a night\r\namong the rats in the grain-loft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wurram!\" replied the cat, which doubtless meant that he was perfectly\r\nwilling, and that it would be a bad job for the rats. So the programme was\r\nduly carried out, and Master Gilbert was shut up among the foe.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, my father, who had not closed an eye all the night,\r\nopened the door, and, lame and bleeding, out limped his old favourite,\r\nshaking his poor head--raw with wounds--in the most pitiful manner\r\npossible. The brave beast had fought like a tiger all the night long,\r\nnearly two score of rats lay dead around, while the blood lay in pools on\r\nthe decks, with as much hair and fluff, as if a dozen Kilkenny cats had\r\nbeen contending for victory--and got it. That night's ratting proved fatal\r\nto old Gibbie. The dreadful wounds he had received never healed, and after\r\nmuch deliberation it was determined that an end should be put to the poor\r\nanimal's sufferings.\r\n\r\nSo honest Hughoc, the stable-boy, was sent with Gibbie in a bag to drown\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Is he gone?\" said my mother anxiously, when he returned. And we bairns\r\nwere all in tears.\r\n\r\n\"Gone, ma'am?\" replied Hughoc; \"aye, if he had been a horse, and, beggin'\r\nyour pardon, a deevil forbye, the river would hae ta'en him doon,--sic a\r\nspate (flood) I never saw in my born days.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, Gibbie was at that moment finishing the contents\r\nof his saucer, and drying his wet sides before the sitting-room fire, and\r\nwhen we entered, he was singing a song to himself, like the ancient\r\nphilosopher he was. But the poor cat lived but one short week longer. He\r\ndied, as bardie Burns has it, \"a fair strae death\" in his own nook, and\r\nwas slowly and sadly laid to rest, beneath an aged rowan tree at the end\r\nof the garden. And the berries on that tree grew redder ever after, at\r\nleast we thought so; but we never dared to taste or touch them, they were\r\nsacred to the memory of poor dead and gone Gibbie.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the plague of rats continued unabated, and their ravages\r\nseemed rather to increase than diminish. But their reign was nearly at an\r\nend. One day my father received the joyful intelligence that a splendid\r\nyoung lady-kitten, was in need of a comfortable home--salary no object.\r\n\r\nAway with a basket trudged my little brother and self, and after a long\r\nwalk came to young pussy's residence, and had the satisfaction of finding\r\nboth kitten and mistress at home. The former, indeed a beauty, and\r\nfaultlessly marked, was engaged alternately in drinking butter-milk, and\r\nwashing her face before a small looking-glass.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, my bonnie bairn,\"--I was the bonnie bairn, not my brother,--\"she's a\r\nperfect wee angel, and ye maun be good till her; ye maunna pu' her by the\r\ntail, and ye maun gie her lots o' milk, and never let her want for a\r\nlookin'-glass.\"\r\n\r\nWe promised to grudge her nothing that could in any way conduce to her\r\nhappiness and comfort, and were allowed to carry her off. Before we\r\nreached home, we had taken her from the basket, and with all the solemnity\r\nthe occasion demanded, baptized her in a running stream, and called her\r\nname Muffie. Once fairly established in her new quarters, the kit lost no\r\ntime in commencing hostilities against the rats, and blood, not\r\nbutter-milk, became her war-cry. One day as she sat admiring herself in\r\nthe glass, a large rat unexpectedly appeared in the kitchen; and although\r\nbut little larger than himself, Kittie at once gave chase, not only to his\r\nhole, but into his hole. For the next three minutes the squeaking was\r\nquite harrowing to listen to; but presently pussy re-appeared stern\r\nforemost, and dragging with her the rat--dead. This she deposited before\r\nthe fire, growling whenever any one went near it, as much as to say, \"Lay\r\nbut a finger on it, and you yourself may expect to pay the same penalty\r\nfor your rashness.\" The little thing, indeed, seemed swelling with pride\r\nand importance, and must have felt considerably bigger than an ordinary\r\nsized ox, and as fierce as a Bengal tiger. In one moment she had bounded\r\nfrom kit to cat-hood. Buttermilk and a looking-glass! Bah! Blood alone\r\ncould satisfy her ambition now.\r\n\r\nLittle Muffie was left that night in sole charge of the kitchen, and next\r\nmorning, no less than five large rats, lay side by side on the hearth, as\r\nif waiting a _post mortem_, and wee pussie, with her white breast dabbled\r\nin gore, exhausted and asleep, lay beside them. In less than a week, she\r\nhad bagged upwards of forty, and no doubt wounded twice that number. And\r\nnow fear and consternation began to spread in the enemies' camp. Such\r\ndoings had never been heard of among them, even traditionally. The oldest\r\ninhabitant shook his grey muzzle, and gave it up; but added,--\r\n\r\n\"Friends, brethren, rodents! it is time to shift. No one knows whose turn\r\nmay come next. True, it is a pity to leave such jolly quarters, when\r\neverything was going on so pleasantly. We have seen our fattest wives and\r\nour biggest braves borne off; our helpless babes have not been safe from\r\nthe clutches of that dreaded monster, with the ferocity of a fiend in the\r\nskin of a mouse, and lest worst befall us, _go we must_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd go they did.\r\n\r\nOld Tom Riddle, the parish clerk, who might have been seen any night,\r\nstaggering homewards in the short hours, was well-nigh scared out of the\r\nlittle wits that remained to him, by meeting, as he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Thoosands upon thoosands o' rottens, haudin' up the road in the direction\r\no' the farm o' Brockenclough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confoond it,\" he added, when some one ventured to cast a doubt on his\r\nstatement; \"wasn't it bright moonlicht, and didn't I see them wi' my ain\r\neen, carryin' their wee anes in their mooths, and leadin' their blin' wi'\r\na strae?\"\r\n\r\nWhether old Tom exaggerated or not is hard to say; but sure enough, next\r\nmorning there was not a rat to be seen or heard about my father's\r\npremises; and it is likewise correct that about the same time, the honest\r\nfarmer of Brockenclough, began to complain loudly of the destruction by\r\nthese gentry of his straw and oats. \"He liked,\" he said, \"to see a few o'\r\nthe beasties rinnin' aboot a farm-toon. That was a sign o' plenty; but\r\nwhen they could be counted by the score, it fairly beat cock-fechtin.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next twelve months of her existence, Muffie led a very quiet and\r\npeaceful life. She was now in her prime--and a more beautifully marked\r\ntabby it would have been difficult to imagine--but, as yet, no male of her\r\nspecies had gained her youthful affections. But her time soon came, for\r\nstrolling one day in the woods, trying to pick up a nice fat linnet for\r\nher dinner, Muffie met her fate, and her fate followed her home even to\r\nthe garden gate, then darted off again to his native woodland. His history\r\nwas briefly this. He was not born of respectable parentage, and I\r\nquestion, too, whether his parents, were at all more honest than they\r\nought to have been. His mother was a half-wild animal, brought by a\r\nhalf-cracked colonel from the West Indies, and she bore him in the woods,\r\nand there she suckled and reared him, and it was no doubt owing to the\r\nwild gipsy life he led, and the amount of freedom and fresh air he\r\nenjoyed, that he grew so fine an animal. At any rate, I never have seen\r\nhis match. An immense red tabby he was, with short ears on a massive head,\r\nsplendid eyes, and a tail that no wild cat need have been ashamed of.\r\nMuffie and her lover used to hold their meetings in the ruins of an old\r\nhouse near a wood, and my brothers and I made a rash vow, to attempt the\r\ncapture of the beautiful stranger in this same building. Accordingly, one\r\nfine moonlight night, missing Lady Muff, and guessing she was on the\r\nspoon, we sallied out and made our way to the ruin. My brothers were told\r\noff to guard the door and windows, and on me alone devolved the somewhat\r\nunpleasant duty, of bagging the cat. With this intention I entered as\r\ncautiously as a mouse, and sure enough there sat the happy pair,\r\ncontentedly, on the cold hearthstone. So engrossed were they in looking at\r\neach other, that they never perceived me until quite close upon them.\r\nWith the agility of a young monkey, I threw myself on the Tom-cat and\r\nseized him by the back. That is exactly what _I_ did. His proceedings were\r\nsomewhat different, and considerably more to the point, for after making\r\nhis four teeth meet in the fleshy part of my middle finger, he slid from\r\nmy grasp like a conger-eel, and went hand over hand up the chimney,\r\nfollowed by the justly indignant Lady Muff,--and I was left lamenting. For\r\nthe next six weeks, I had the satisfaction of going to school with my arm\r\nin a sling. I say satisfaction, because my misfortune was the cause of a\r\ngreat alteration, in the manner of the schoolmaster towards me. Previously\r\nit was usual with me to be thrashed \"_ter die_, and well shaken,\" which\r\nwas not at all nice on a winter's day; but now all this was changed, and I\r\nwas not beaten at all. The pedagogue spoke to me subduedly, and with a\r\ncertain amount of conciliatory awe in his manner, and I observed that he\r\nalways kept a chair or form between my person and his, lest I should at\r\nany time take hydrophobia without giving sufficient warning, and bite the\r\npoor man. Seeing how well the sling worked, I did not hesitate to wear it,\r\nfor fully a month after my hand was quite healed, with the exception of\r\nthe cicatrices, which the grave only will obliterate.\r\n\r\nAlthough beaten in our first efforts, we did not give up the idea of\r\ncapturing this vagabond Tom-tabby, yet it was only through the\r\ninstrumentality of Muffie, we eventually succeeded. We kept her at home,\r\nput a saucer-full of creamy milk in a shady nook of the garden for her\r\nlover, and whenever he appeared, which he always did at the hour of\r\ngloaming, his betrothed was permitted to meet him, and although he\r\ninvariably beseeched her to fly with him, she was prevented from acceding\r\nto his very reasonable request, by being tethered to a gooseberry bush by\r\na long string. Love and time tamed this feline Ingomar. He left his abode\r\nin the forest, exchanged the wild-wood's shade for the stable's roof,\r\nbartered his freedom for the ties of matrimony, or catrimony,--in short,\r\nhe married Muffie, adopted civilisation, and became barn-cat _par\r\nexcellence_. But no amount of persuasion could ever entice him into the\r\ndwelling-house, nor did he ever suffer a human finger to pollute his fur.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that Ingomar did not at all times behave well to his\r\nwife; in fact, at times he was a brute. It was his pleasure that she\r\nshould sit for hours together in the garden, simply that he might look at\r\nher; if she as much as hinted at retiring, he treated her exactly as the\r\nLancashire clod-hoppers do their wives,--he knocked her down and jumped\r\nupon her. Muffie had five bonnie kittens, and she put them to bed on the\r\nparlour sofa. Ingomar detested refinement as much as Rob Roy did.\r\n\r\n\"The sons of McGregor, weavers! Bring those kittens forth, and place them\r\nhere on straw; _I_ will see to their rearing.\"\r\n\r\nThat is what Ingomar said, and Muffie mutely complied; and those kittens\r\ngrew up as wild as himself. From sparrows they got to chickens, from\r\nchickens to grouse and game generally, and then got into trouble with the\r\nkeeper, and had the worst of the argument, which on his part was\r\ndouble-barrelled. In the early days of his betrothal, Ingomar threw\r\ndaisies at his beloved, and gambolled with her in mimic strife, but\r\nlatterly his song was hushed at eventide, and spits and clouts and flying\r\nfluff were too often the order of the day.\r\n\r\nPoor Ingomar! He was cut down in his prime--slain by a wretched\r\ncollie-dog. Slowly and sadly we bore him in, his beautiful fur all dabbled\r\nin blood, and his once bright eyes fast glazing in death, and tenderly\r\nlaid him at the widowed Muffie's feet. Now listen to the remarkable\r\nbehaviour of that lady. The widowed Muffie did not weep, neither, in\r\nconsequence of not weeping, did she die; she did an attitude though, then\r\ngrowled and spat, and spitting growled again, and finally gave vent to her\r\nfeelings by springing through the parlour window and escaping to the\r\nwoods. And here with shame and sorrow for female inconstancy, but in the\r\ninterests of truth be it written, not only did Muffie not remain long a\r\nwidow, but that brief widowhood even, was stained by many acts of levity\r\nto the memory of the murdered Ingomar. His skin beautifully preserved\r\n(by--[12]), that skin she did not hesitate to use as a mat, nay, she even\r\n_gambolled with the tail of it_; and although she often paid a visit to\r\nher husband's grave, it was not to weep she went there, no! but literally\r\nto _dance on the top of it_. Such is life! Such are relicts!!\r\n\r\nThe rest of this pussy's life was entirely uneventful. One circumstance\r\nonly deserves relating. She was exceedingly fond of me, in fact quite\r\nadored me. Oh! that is nothing, other females have done the same; but\r\nMuffie did, what I daresay other females wouldn't,--she at any time would\r\neat a little bit of the end of a candle, or a bit of greased peat from my\r\nhand, while refusing beef-steak or cream from any one else. When I was\r\nsent to a distant school, and could only visit my home once a week or\r\nfortnight, the house bereft of me had no longer any charms for poor\r\nMuffie, and she took to the woods. Perhaps she enjoyed rambling amid\r\nscenes hallowed by the recollection of her early love. She seldom returned\r\nhome until the day of my accustomed arrival, when she was always there to\r\nwelcome me. Now that she should have known the usual day for my appearance\r\nwas nothing remarkable, but it was strange that, if anything interfered\r\nwith my coming, puss was also absent, nor did my arrival on any other day\r\nprevent her from being at home at least an hour before me. One day--alas!\r\nthat one day that _must_ come to all created things--my Muffie was not\r\nthere to meet me, and she never came again. After a long search I found\r\nher beneath a tree, stark and stiff. Her gentle eyes were closed for aye!\r\nI would never feel again her soft caress, nor hear her low loving\r\npurr--dear Muffie was _dead_.\r\n\r\nBut dry your eyes, gentle lady, and listen to the story of\r\n\r\n\r\nMUFFIE THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nI call my present cat Muffie, partly in remembrance of my old favourite,\r\nand partly because I think it such a cosy little name for a pet puss.\r\nBless her little heart, she is sitting on my shoulder while I write, and\r\nno slight burden either, her fighting weight being something over twelve\r\npounds. A splendid tabby, she is evenly and prettily marked; her lovely\r\nface vandyked with white, and her nose tipped with crimson, like a\r\nmountain daisy. She is six years of age, and the mother of over one\r\nhundred kittens. Three-fourths of these have found respectable\r\nhomes,--most of them were bespoken before birth,--and if they have only\r\nbeen half as prolific as their mother, Muffie must be progenitor of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by R. H. YOUNG, ESQ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by Mr. J. HARPER.]\r\n\r\nA very ambitious kitten you were, too, my pretty Muff. I first picked you\r\nup at an hotel, when no bigger than a ball of worsted. Your brothers and\r\nsisters, and even your big ugly mother turned and fled, but you stood and\r\nspat--didn't you, puss? and that fetched me. Your favourite seat, too, was\r\nthe top of the parlour door; and during the first twelve months of your\r\nexistence, sure didn't you tear to pieces three sets of window curtains?\r\ndidn't you smash all the flowerpots? weren't you constantly clutching\r\ndown the table-cloth and breaking the china and glass, running along the\r\nkey-board of the piano, and jumping down the stool? What chance did a silk\r\numbrella stand with you? What hope of existence had my patent-leather\r\nboots? Was it fair to catch flies on my \"Sunset on Arran\" before the paint\r\nwas dry? Was it right to upset my ink-bottle on the table-cloth, or to\r\nbreak the head off my praying Samuel, which head you coolly made a mouse\r\nof, and finally hid in my shoe? Or was it at all proper to make such\r\nearnest, though happily unsuccessful, endeavours to hook your master's\r\neyes out as soon as he opened them in the morning? But marriage sobered\r\nyou, Muffie; and I never can forget the extreme joy you manifested on the\r\nbirth of your first kittens. Your first idea, I'm told, was to make\r\n\"mousies\" of them; then you thought of eating them. But how anxiously you\r\nwaited my arrival on that auspicious morning. You came twice to my bedroom\r\nto hurry me down, and I dared not stop to shave. Then each kitten in\r\nsuccession was held up between your forepaws to receive its just meed of\r\nadmiration. But I hardly think, Miss Muff, your song of joy would have\r\nbeen quite so loud and jubilant, had you known I was selecting two to\r\ndrown. And each succeeding period since then, you have tried to have your\r\nkittens in my bed, and twice you have been only too successful. There,\r\nnow, go down, my shoulder aches; besides, I have to address the British\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nMuffie, like her master, has been a wanderer,--and she prefers it. To her,\r\nhome and master are synonymous terms. Were I to make my bed in the midst\r\nof a highland moor, she would not desert me. If I were to place my\r\nsea-chest on the top of dark Loch-na-gar,--and that would be no easy\r\nmatter,--and leave it there for a month, I should find Muffie on the top\r\nof it when I returned.\r\n\r\nIt might very naturally be supposed, that a cat would form but a poor\r\ntravelling companion, and be rather troublesome. It is all custom, I\r\nsuppose. Miss Muff, at the smallest computation, must have travelled\r\nnearly 20,000 miles with me; and she can always take care of herself much\r\nbetter than a dog can. From constant experience, she has become quite\r\ncosmopolitan in her habits. On the evening before \"flitting day\" she is\r\nmore than usually active, ambling round and snuffing at each box as it is\r\nbeing packed, and rubbing her shoulder against it, singing all the while\r\nin a most exhilarating manner. As night closes, she, as a rule, with few\r\nexceptions, disappears for a time, going most likely to bid good-bye to\r\nher friends, whom she seldom sees again in this world, but never fails to\r\nbe back early in the morning, when, after a hurried breakfast, she curls\r\nherself up in her little travelling \"creel,\" and goes quietly off to\r\nsleep. In a railway-carriage or steam-boat, she is allowed to roam about\r\nat her own sweet will; but by night her place is by her master's side, and\r\na more faithful watch he could not have. On arriving at an hotel, after\r\ndinner pussy is permitted to go out to see the place. The first night of\r\nher sojourn in a strange town, is always spent by Muffie in the open air;\r\nand, wonderful to relate, she always enters in the morning by the _front\r\ndoor_, although put out at the back. How she can find her way round with\r\naccuracy, sometimes a distance of half a mile of strange streets, or how\r\nshe can tell the hotel door from any other, I cannot say; but she does.\r\nOnce I gave her basket in charge of a railway porter at a London station,\r\nto take upstairs while I got my own ticket and the dog's. The poor fellow\r\nsoon returned with bleeding face and hands, to say that the cat had\r\nescaped and disappeared in the crowd. There was no time to wait to look\r\nfor her, my luggage was on board, and the train about to start, so I\r\nhurried off to take my seat. Very much to my surprise, I was hailed from a\r\nfirst-class carriage by my pet herself, who appeared rejoiced to see me,\r\nand indeed was much more calm and self-possessed, under the circumstances,\r\nthan her master.\r\n\r\nOnce, in a strange town--Liverpool,--Muffie disappeared in the most\r\nmysterious manner, and was absent for three whole weeks. From some words\r\nthat I had heard the landlady's son drop, I suspected foul play; so I went\r\nstraight to the offices of the City Scavengering Department to prefer a\r\nvery modest request, viz., to have all the ashpits cleaned out within a\r\ncertain radius of my lodgings.\r\n\r\n\"All this work for a cat!\" said the chief inspector. \"Why, such a thing\r\nhas no precedent;\" and he smiled at my cheek, I suppose.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"you can make this case the precedent; and it is so\r\nvaluable a cat, you know.\"\r\n\r\nAid came from an unexpected quarter. One of the officers was a Scotchman,\r\nand took my part like everything. Valuable property, he argued, had been\r\nstolen and destroyed; and if we should wait until the usual time for\r\ncleaning the ashpits, all hope of putting the blame on the right party,\r\nwould be lost for ever.\r\n\r\n\"What chance,\" said his good-natured chief, \"have I against two of you?\"\r\nSo the order was given, and the ash-pits emptied. This took two or three\r\nmornings' work, and many dead cats were found; in fact, every day I held a\r\npost-mortem examination on one or two poor brutes, and of course the men\r\nwanted a glass of grog; so that the business cost me \"a power\" of rum. But\r\nno dead Muffie appeared. In the meantime I had to go to London without my\r\npuss; and a few days after, Lady Muff likewise arrived by train. She had\r\nreturned to my rooms at Liverpool, exactly three weeks from the day she\r\ndisappeared, and _had kittens one hour after_.\r\n\r\nMuffie I do not think ever killed a mouse, although very fond of catching\r\nthem. All she cares for is the sport. She invariably brings her little\r\nvictim into my room, and placing it on the hearth-rug, looks up in my\r\nface, and mews, as much as to say,--\r\n\r\n\"Just observe, master, the fun I shall have with this little cuss; and see\r\nwhat a clever mouser your Muff is.\"\r\n\r\nWhile she is saying this, the mouse has escaped, but is speedily\r\nrecaptured and returned to the rug. After throwing it up in the air two\r\nor three times, and catching it before it falls, the wee \"cowering\r\ntimorous beastie\" is left to its own freedom, Muffie walking away in a\r\ncareless, meditative sort of mood, and the mousie makes good his escape.\r\nNot finding a hole, it hides below something, from under which something\r\nit is soon raked out again; and so the cruel game goes on, till the\r\ntrembling little creature, with its shiny eyes, grows sick with hope\r\ndeferred, and faints away. Seeing this, pussy, after turning it over once\r\nor twice with mittened paw, jumps on my shoulder with a fond \"purr-rn,\"\r\nand begins to sing. The play is over, and by-and-by the mouse revives, and\r\nis graciously permitted to retire, which it sets about doing with becoming\r\nmodesty, and an air at once subdued and deprecatory. Muffie is still on my\r\nshoulder, benignly singing. Their eyes meet, and a little dialogue ensues.\r\nMousie says, with hers,\r\n\r\n\"Oh! please, your ladyship, may I go, ma'am? I feel so all-overish; your\r\nclaws are _so_ sharp, and your teeth so dreadful; and I'm but a little,\r\nlittle mouse.\"\r\n\r\nTo which pussy replies,--\r\n\r\n\"Yes; you may go. I shan't eat you to-day; only don't do it again.\"\r\n\r\nBut why, you ask, should I permit such cruel sport? Because, intelligent\r\nand gentle reader, any interference of mine would change the play from a\r\ncomedy in the parlour to a tragedy in the cellar.\r\n\r\nI have neither fishing nor hunting exploits to tell of about Muffie. She\r\nis celebrated only as a great traveller, for her faithful devotion to her\r\nmaster, and for her care over even his property.\r\n\r\nLast summer I spent a month in a beautiful sequestered village in\r\nYorkshire. My companions were, as usual, my Newfoundland, Muffie, a pet\r\nstarling, and another dog. Muffie is very much attached to this birdie,\r\nallowing it to hop about her, like a crow on a water buffalo. This\r\nstarling, I think, is the most amusing little chap in all creation. He is\r\na good linguist and an accomplished musician, and is never silent--if he\r\nis, he is either asleep or doing mischief. As he says whatever comes into\r\nhis head, and interlards his discourse with fragments of tunes and\r\nBravos! the effect is at times startling. The way he jumbles his nouns\r\ntogether, and trots out every adjective he knows, to qualify every noun,\r\nis something worth listening to. In the summer evenings, we used to go out\r\nfor long rambles in the country lanes. The dog--Theodore Nero--felt\r\nhimself in duty bound on these occasions, not only to look after his\r\nmaster, but even to take the cat under his protection. The starling\r\nstalked flies from my shoulder. Sometimes he would stay longer\r\nsnail-hunting, behind a hedge, than I deemed prudent; a glance from me was\r\nall Muffie wanted, to be after him. I would wait and listen; and presently\r\nI would hear Dick excitedly exclaiming, \"Eh? eh? What _is_ it?\"--a\r\nfavourite expression of his: \"What _is_ it? You rascal! you rascal!\" and\r\nback he would fly to his perch, apparently quite thunderstruck at the\r\nimpudence of the cat.\r\n\r\nMuffie bids me say she is quite happy and all alive. And I would add, she\r\nis very much all alive, most interestingly so, in fact. But that did not\r\nprevent her, last night, from preparing for me, what was doubtless meant\r\nfor a very pretty surprise and a high compliment. The cats in the\r\nneighbourhood, hearing that I was writing a book in their favour, with\r\nLady Muff as chief musician, resolved to serenade me; and they did. Being\r\nChristmas eve, I took them for the waits at first. I am sorry now that I\r\nso far forgot myself, as to throw cold water over the assembly; but I\r\nsincerely trust that they did not know, that the gentleman in white, who\r\nappeared on the balcony, and so unceremoniously checked their harmony, was\r\nthe illustrious author of \"CATS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nBLACK TOM, THE SKIPPER'S IMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM'S INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nNo one in the ship had the slightest idea how Tom came on board, or who\r\nbrought him, or where he came from. He made his first appearance in public\r\nwhile, outward bound, we were crossing the Bay of Biscay--that strange\r\nmysterious sea, beneath whose waves the bones of so many of our bravest\r\ncountrymen lie bleaching. It was a roughish night, squally rather, without\r\nmuch sea on, but the wind changing its mind every minute, whisking into\r\nfoam the crests of the inky waves, and carrying the spray far into the\r\nrigging. It was a night to try the sea-legs of any one, so jerky and\r\nuncertain was the vessel's motion; and the oldest sailors staggered like\r\ndrunken men, and were fain to cling to rigging or shrouds. I was smoking\r\non the quarter-deck just before turning in,--it had gone six bells[13] in\r\nthe first watch, and everything was snug for the night, when something\r\nblack as Erebus whisked past me, visible but for a moment in the\r\nbinnacle's light, and disappeared in the darkness forward. I looked\r\ninquiringly at the man at the wheel, a serious old seamen, who, in answer\r\nto my mute appeal, turned his quid twice in his mouth and, addressing the\r\ncompass, \"That's the devil, sir,\" said he, \"begging your pardon, sir. Came\r\non board to-night when we close-reefed topsails durin' a squall.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing disrespectful in the man's tone or bearing; indeed he\r\nspoke almost with an air of solemnity.\r\n\r\n\"Usual accompaniment, I suppose,\" said I, laughing; \"blue fire, and a\r\nperfume not Rimmelian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dunno what ship that is, sir,\" said he somewhat curtly; \"but there was a\r\nflash, young gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing the man was disinclined to continue the subject, I went below, and,\r\nthanks to the ship's motion, was soon in the land of dreams.\r\n\r\nNext day broke bright and clear; both wind and cloud had fled; the sea\r\nhad gone down, and the vessel was under easy sail. A flock of gulls were\r\ncircling in the morning air, screaming with delight as they picked the\r\ncrumbs that floated astern; and all went merrily oh!\r\n\r\nPresently the commander[14] came up, looking anything but sweet; and all\r\nhands were immediately summoned aft for a speech. \"Officers and men of Her\r\nMajesty's gunboat _Tickler_, contrary to the customs and rules of the\r\nservice, and without my knowledge, to say nothing of sanction, I find that\r\na cat has been brought on board. Will the officer or man who owns the\r\nanimal kindly step forward?\"\r\n\r\nHere the officers, verbally, and the men, by their silence, disclaimed all\r\nownership of poor puss.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued the commanding officer, \"as no one seems to own it, I\r\nhave but one course. Bring up the cat.\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were instantly turned towards the stern grating, which naturally\r\ncaused the captain to wheel round; and there, sure enough, as mim as a\r\nmouse, with his tail curled round his legs for warmth, and looking on the\r\nvery best of terms with himself and all creation, sat a large black Tom\r\ncat. He lowered his brows as he returned the skipper's glance, and his\r\neyes sparkled crimson and green. \"Midshipman of the watch,\" was the order,\r\n\"see that cat overboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay ay, sir,\" sang out the middy. \"Forenoon watch, cat walks the plank,\r\nheave with a will--cheerily does it.\"\r\n\r\nPuss was on his legs in a moment, back erect, hair on end, and tail like a\r\nbottle-brush, spitting, sputtering, and behaving altogether in a \"highly\r\nmutinous and insubordinate\" manner. This conduct very nearly led to a\r\nfatal termination, by a whole shower of belaying-pins, which, however,\r\nhurtled harmlessly over his head. \"An inch of a miss is as good as a\r\nmile,\" thought Tom; \"while there's life there's hope, and I'll give you a\r\nrace for it, my lads.\" And he cleared the deck at three bounds, and dived\r\nbelow, followed by the whole watch. Three minutes' trampling and howling\r\nbelow, then up through the fore hatch came pursuers and pursued, pussy\r\nleading and the sailors astern. Up the rigging shinned the cat.\r\n\r\n\"Follow your leader,\" roared the men.\r\n\r\nThe chase now became general and most exciting; and with a cheer all hands\r\njoined, evidently more for the fun of the thing, than with any intention\r\nof harming the cat. Up the rigging and down the stays, alow and aloft, out\r\non the flying jib-boom and along the hammock nettings. Sure never before\r\nwere such feats of agility seen on board a British Man o' War; the men\r\nseemed monkeys, the cat the devil incarnate. With a strength seemingly\r\nsupernatural, Tom at length scrambled up, and took refuge above the main\r\ntruck where the Dutch Admiral of old hoisted the broom, swearing, as only\r\nDutchmen can, that he would sweep the English from the sea; and the men\r\nreturned to the deck, gasping and red from their futile exertions, to\r\nawait further orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK TOM SPEAKS A PIECE.\r\n\r\n\"Curses on the brute!\" muttered the commander. \"Am I to sail the seas with\r\na black cat on my main-truck? Steward, bring my revolver.\" The revolver\r\nwas brought, but the captain's aim seemed unsteady; he fired all the six\r\nchambers, without any further result than chipping the main-top-gallant\r\nyard. Poor Tom, seeing the serious turn matters had taken, and that his\r\ndeath was compassed, determined to speak a few words in his own behalf;\r\nand with this intention he lifted up his fore-paw, and, now looking below,\r\nnow appealing to heaven, he delivered an harangue, the like of which none\r\nof us had ever listened to on shore, much less afloat. His meaning,\r\nhowever, was perfectly plain.\r\n\r\nAround him, he said, behold a waste of waters; he was far from land; he\r\nhad no boat; and though he knew he could swim, although he never tried, he\r\nwould rather die than wet his feet. Had we no compassion, no bowels of\r\nmercies? He wanted to harm nobody. What good could shooting him do? He\r\nwas willing to remain where he then stood for the rest of the voyage, in\r\nfact to do anything or everything, if his life were only spared.\r\n\r\nThe captain smiled. \"I thought,\" said he, \"I was a better shot; however,\r\ngive the devil his due.\" And he ordered all hands to treat the cat kindly,\r\nif ever he came below again. Tom retained his elevated seat for fully two\r\nhours, and finally fell sound asleep. Waking calm and refreshed, and\r\nperhaps somewhat dizzy, he stretched himself a leg at a time, for he\r\nhadn't much room, yawned, did an attitude, and came slowly down on deck.\r\nHe walked at once to the quarter-deck; and, to show that he harboured no\r\nill-feeling, he actually went and rubbed his big black head against the\r\ncaptain's leg.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM BECOMES SHIP'S CAT.\r\n\r\nHenceforward Tom was no longer a mere passenger on board; his name was\r\nborne on the ship's books, and he was tolerated both by officers and men.\r\nSomehow, Tom became no favourite. The questionable manner in which he had\r\nmade his first appearance, and the latent devil that seemed to lurk in his\r\neye, acted like a spell on the natural superstitions of the sailors, more\r\nthan one of whom was heard to express an opinion that \"That\r\nblack----(alliterative term of endearment used by British seamen) will\r\nbring the ship no good luck.\"\r\n\r\nNow, whether out of gratitude for having his life spared, or for some\r\nother feline motive known only to puss, certain it is, that Tom attached\r\nhimself to our commander, and to no one else on board; for whenever that\r\nofficer came on deck, so did the cat, trotting by his side and enlivening\r\nhis walk by a song. When any other gentleman happened to be walking with\r\nthe captain, Tom used to take his station on the hammock nettings and\r\nfollow every motion of his beloved adopted master with eyes that beamed\r\nwith admiration. This show of affection was at first indignantly resented\r\nby the skipper, and many a good kick Tom used to have for his pains; but\r\nthe more he was kicked the louder he sang, so at long last, yielding to\r\nthe force of circumstances, the skipper ceased to mind him, and the two\r\nbecame inseparable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM GOES ON SHORE FOR A WALK.\r\n\r\nNothing very unusual happened during our long voyage to the Cape. Tom went\r\non shore at St. Helena, like any other officer, and it was fondly hoped he\r\nwould take up his abode on that beautiful island. But having visited the\r\nprincipal places of interest, nearly murdered a poor little dog in James\r\nTown, and--this is only conjecture--taken a rat or two at Napoleon's tomb,\r\nTom came off again in the officers' boat.\r\n\r\n\r\nON BOARD AGAIN.\r\n\r\nThe cat might in time have come to be a general favourite in the ship; but\r\nhe suffered no advances to be made by \"any man Jack,\" as the saying is,\r\nand scowled so unmistakably when any one attempted to stroke him, that he\r\nwas unanimously voted to Coventry, and allowed to do what he liked. Tom\r\nhad a regular allowance of ship's provisions, like any one else, but his\r\ngreatest treat was milk (preserved) and rum thickened with oatmeal. For\r\nthis he used to come regularly once, and often twice a-day, to the\r\ndispensary. His favourite seat was on the weather bulwarks; and there he\r\nwould often remain for hours, gazing thoughtfully down in the blue clear\r\ndepths of the tropical ocean.\r\n\r\n\"He do be counting the jelly-fish and looking for sharks,\" one man\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said another, \"he's a-thinking o' home. May-be, he has left a wife\r\nand babies in old England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the first speaker, \"what a tarnation fool he was, not to stop\r\non shore. Sure, no one sent for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" said the first, \"he's an evil spirit, Bill, as sure as a gun; and\r\nhe belongs to--\r\n\r\nTHE SKIPPER.\"\r\n\r\nYou may easily guess from the foregoing conversation, that the captain\r\nhimself was no great favourite. He was a little red-haired foxy-faced man,\r\na Scotchman (save the luck), but a Scotchman who hated the land of his\r\nforefathers,--\r\n\r\n  \"Whose heart had ne'er within him burned,\" etc., etc.,\r\n\r\nin fact, retaining but one trait of Scottish character, namely his love\r\nfor Scotch drink. Once round the Cape, and north on our cruising\r\nground--the Mozambique Channel, the skipper shone out in his true colours.\r\nHis face and nose got daily redder; and the sinister smile that seemed\r\nprinted there never left his lips. Such a smile I have never seen before\r\nnor since, except on the face of a Somali Indian. The first victims to the\r\nskipper's wrath were the poor black Kroomen, one of whom was always\r\nstationed at the mast head, to look out for strange sails. Now the\r\ncommander had an eye like a fish-hawk, and generally managed to sight a\r\nvessel before even the out-look. God help the out-look when this occurred.\r\nHe was ordered down at once, and in one minute more was lashed to the\r\nrigging by both wrists, and writhing and shrieking for mercy under the\r\ninfliction of two dozen with a rope's end, laid on by the sturdy arms of a\r\nfellow Krooman. The men, for the slightest offence, had their grog stopped\r\nfor a week or weeks; and as the proceeds went to swell the sick-fund--a\r\nfund to purchase comforts for the patients--I had usually more money in my\r\nhands than I knew how to expend, until I happily thought of a plan to get\r\nrid of the surplus cash.\r\n\r\n\"Brown,\" I would say to an officer, after the cloth had been removed, \"you\r\nlook unusually seedy to-day; in fact,\" looking round the mess, \"you all\r\nlook rather pale; effects of climate, poor devils. I am afraid I have\r\nhardly done my duty towards you. Steward, bring in those bananas from the\r\nsick-bay, bring also the pineapples, the mangoes, the oranges, the ground\r\nnuts, a pomola, and a bottle of madeira. Liquor up, my lads, let us drink\r\nthe skipper's health. The sick-bay fund is unusually flourishing, so don't\r\nforget in every port we come to, to ask me for honey for your rum, milk\r\nfor your tea, and orange-blossom to perfume your cabins withal.\"\r\n\r\nAnything approaching insubordination among the boys or men or board was\r\npunished with flogging--four dozen lashes, with a different bo'swain's\r\nmate to each dozen, was the usual dose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM AT A FLOGGING.\r\n\r\nTuesday was flogging day; and to add, if possible, to the terror of the\r\ncondemned wretch, after the gratings were rigged and the man stripped and\r\nlashed thereto, sawdust was sprinkled on the deck all round, to soak up\r\nthe blood. But at every flogging match\r\n\r\n  \"There sat auld Nick in shape o' beast,\"\r\n\r\nat least in the shape of Tom the cat, who would not have missed the fun\r\nfor all the world. There on the bulwark he would sit, his eyes gleaming\r\nwith satisfaction, his mouth squared, and his beard all a-bristle. He\r\nseemed to count every dull thud of his nine-tailed namesake, and emitted\r\nshort sharp mews of joy when, towards the middle of the third dozen, the\r\nblood began to trickle and get sprinkled about on sheet and shroud. Though\r\nI never disliked Tom, still, at times such as these, I really believed he\r\nwas the devil himself as reputed, and would have given two months' pay for\r\na chance to brain him. When the flogging was over, Tom used to jump down\r\nand, purring loudly, rub his head against his master's leg.\r\n\r\nBy at least one half of the crew, Tom was assuredly believed to be--if not\r\nold Nick himself--possessed of an evil spirit. A good deal of mumbo jumbo\r\nwork therefore went on, for the men tried to find favour in Tom's eyes,\r\nand many a dainty morsel did this cat of evil repute thus receive; so that\r\nhe grew and flourished like a green bay-tree, while his coat got glossier\r\nand his figure plumper every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TOM USED TO FISH.\r\n\r\nAlthough well fed and cared for, Tom at times used to forage for himself,\r\nnot that I ever heard he was a thief--to his honour be it written; but he\r\nfished, and very successfully too, without so much as wetting the soles of\r\nhis beautiful pumps. His _modus operandi_ was as follows.\r\n\r\nOn dark nights in the tropical seas, he used to perch himself on the\r\nbulwarks aft, and bend his glittering eyes downwards into the sea. He\r\nnever sat long thus without a flying-fish, sometimes two, jumping past him\r\nor over him, and alighting on deck. Then Tom would descend, and have a\r\ndelightful supper, and if not fully satisfied resume his seat and continue\r\nthe sport. Tom must have gained his knowledge from experience, although\r\nthe success of his method of fishing is easily explained. It is well known\r\nthat these fish always fly towards a light, which is therefore often used\r\nby the sailors to catch them. The cat required no other light save the\r\nglimmering of his two eyes, which in the dark shone like a couple of\r\nkoh-i-noors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM TAKES CHARGE OF A GUN.\r\n\r\nTom was in the habit of going to sleep, in the large pivot gun we used for\r\nshelling running-away slavers. For a forenoon nap nothing could have\r\nsuited him better; it combined the pleasures of solitude with retirement,\r\nand moreover was both dark and cool. One fine sunny day, we were in chase\r\nof a particularly fast dhow, which, taking no heed of our signal\r\nhowitzers, evinced a strong disposition to edge in towards the shore, the\r\norder was accordingly given to fire at her with our Big Ben. Before\r\nloading, the gunner keeked in to see that all was clear, and sure enough\r\nthere was Tom, by no means pleased at being disturbed in his siesta.\r\nNeither could any amount of \"cheety-pussying\" entice him from his\r\nsnuggery, while tickling with the end of a ramrod only made him spit and\r\nsputter, and make use of bad language.\r\n\r\n\"What's the delay?\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Cat in possession of gun, sir,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! dear me!\" whined the captain. \"Rouse him out, and be quick about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a pause.\r\n\r\n\"He won't rouse out no-how, sir,\" said the gunner.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hanged\" roared the skipper, \"if that rascally dhow isn't landing her\r\nslaves inshore. Rouse him out I say. Fire a fuse--_con_found the cat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoal water ahead, sir,\" from the man at the mast-head.\r\n\r\n\"Hard a port, stand by both anchors,\" and round we went just in time to\r\nsave us. In the meantime a fuse had been inserted in the touch-hole of the\r\ngun. Bang! and thus attacked in rear, Tom came out of the gun faster than\r\never he had done in his life, and took to the rigging, with hair on-end\r\nand eyes all a-flame.\r\n\r\n\"Lower away the first and second cutters,\" was now the order. \"It shan't\r\nbe said, that a cursed cat kept us from capturing a lawful prize. D----the\r\nbeast.\"\r\n\r\n(For the benefit of those who love strong language _alias_ swearing, it\r\nmust here be stated, that in courtesy to my lady readers I abstain from\r\ngiving the skipper's language _verbatim_, for in that respect he would\r\nhave pleased a Lancashire coal-heaver; he was a don in the use of\r\nexpletives, although, to his credit be it recorded, while freely launching\r\nforth anathemas at the limbs of his men, and consigning their eyes to\r\nperpetual punishment, he just as freely let his own eyes have it. Oh, he\r\nwasn't particular by any means; he gave it to us all alike--officers and\r\nmen, cat and Kroo-boys.)\r\n\r\nHe captured that slaver though--went in the boats personally to do it, and\r\nthat night the sea was lighted up for miles with a blaze, that spoiled\r\npussy's fishing for once. It was a caution to slavers on shore and sharks\r\nat sea. At a good mile's distance we could see to read our last letters\r\nfrom home, by the light of that burning dhow. We were not surprised to see\r\nthe captain come on board, black with smoke and begrimed with gunpowder,\r\nfor we had heard desultory firing, but we were slightly taken aback to see\r\nTom meet him in the gangway, and to observe the captain stoop down and\r\ntenderly caress him. Perhaps he wanted to make up to him, for his former\r\nroughness.\r\n\r\n\"I've given that chap Carrickfergus,\" he remarked, in a sort of a general\r\nway to us officers; and to me he added, \"I suppose the men may have a\r\nglass of grog, doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I said. \"Steward, splice the main brace.\" Then the skipper\r\ndived below and got drunk, which he had the knack of doing on the very\r\nshortest notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAT'S \"CANTRIPS.\"\r\n\r\nOf Tom's adventures on board the saucy little _Tickler_, very much could\r\nbe written. Somehow, he never was safely out of one scrape till into\r\nanother. A dear wee mongoose was once brought on board, and would\r\ndoubtless have become a great pet, if Tom had not broken its back on the\r\nfirst night of its arrival. A monkey was received as a visitor, and with\r\nhim Tom at once declared war, and kept it up to the bitter end. The\r\nmonkey's favourite mode of attack, was to run aloft with a belaying-pin,\r\nand biding his time, let it drop as if by accident on poor pussy's head.\r\nBut Tom let him have it sharp and fierce, whenever he caught him. Once I\r\nremember the monkey was sitting on his hind-quarters on deck, stuffing his\r\ncheeks with cockroaches, and looking as serious as a judge. Tom spied him,\r\nand ran cautiously along the bulwarks, then springing on his foe, he\r\nseized him round the neck with one arm, and with the other administered\r\nsuch a drubbing, as the poor thing never had before in his life. The\r\nmonkey with bleeding face, at length escaped to the maintop, and there\r\ncried itself asleep.\r\n\r\nWhether or not Tom was the Jonas, who caused all the mishaps that fell\r\nupon our little vessel during that four years' cruise, I shall not pretend\r\nto say, although all hands forward firmly believed he was. Like the\r\nwitch-wife in Allan Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd--Tom\r\n\r\n  \"Got the wyte o' a' fell oot;\"\r\n\r\nand certainly Snarley-yow and his master were never more detested than\r\nthat black cat, and the skipper eventually came to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LIFE-BOAT'S CREW, AHOY!\"\r\n\r\nOnce, I remember, we experienced a spell of weather so dark and unsettled,\r\nthat a general gloom prevailed in the ship fore and aft. We were rounding\r\nthe Cape in mid-winter. First we had a gale of wind, our bulwarks stove in\r\nforward, and a boat washed overboard. Then several days with no wind, but\r\na heavy sea on, and the horizon close aboard of us on every side. The\r\nnights were pitchy dark, with thunder and lightning so appalling that no\r\none thought of turning in, till far on in the middle watch. Scenes like\r\nthese can never be described. They are painted with the finger of awe on\r\nthe beholder's memory, and time cannot efface them. I can see even now our\r\nlittle vessel, hanging bows on to the side of that dark wave, the hill of\r\nwater rising above us, the inky gulph beneath, her wet and slippery decks,\r\nand the faces of the men that cling to the cordage, ghastly in the\r\nlightning's glare. A moment more and we are on the brow of the wave, then\r\ndown we drive into the very trough of the sea, where, for a few seconds,\r\nthe ship lies trembling, as if every timber in her sides was instinct with\r\nlife. On such a night as this Tom fell overboard. This may seem like a\r\ndescent from the sublime to the ridiculous. It is a fact, however, and was\r\na very disagreeable descent indeed for poor Tom. The life-buoy was almost\r\ninstantly fired and let go by the commander himself, who alone saw the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\"Ease her! stop her!\" he roared. \"Away life-boat's crew!\"\r\n\r\nUp tumbled the crew, the boat was lowered, and in two minutes more they\r\nhad dropped astern, and were pulling with might and main for the now\r\ndistant life-buoy. The storm had by this time passed over, save an\r\noccasional flash of lightning. For fully ten minutes, each time we rose on\r\nthe crest of a great wave, we could distinctly see the life-buoy's light,\r\nburning bright and beacon-like, away to leeward of us; then it flickered\r\nfeebly, and finally went out.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious heavens!\" exclaimed the Captain, \"that light was never\r\nextinguished: _it has gone out_.\" Five minutes, ten, fifteen minutes\r\nelapsed in dead silence. We leant over the bulwarks, and could feel our\r\nhearts throbbing against them, as we peered into the darkness and listened\r\nfor the slightest sound; only an occasional glimmer played along the\r\nhorizon, only now and then the splash of a breaking wave. Hours passed by,\r\nand still no signal from the deep, to tell us aught of life was there; and\r\nall that long dismal night, rockets were let off, bluelights burned, and\r\nbig guns fired. But the sea gave never a sign. How anxious we all were! No\r\none had a thought of retiring. The captain spent his time in alternately\r\npacing frantically up and down the deck, and in diving down below,--we all\r\nknew for what. At last he wept like a child, and tore his hair out in\r\nhandfuls. I felt sorry for him at first, until I heard him curse his own\r\nevil fate, because his fourteen years' service would all be lost. It was\r\nself not the poor men he was thinking of.\r\n\r\nBut the longest time has an end, and morning came at last, and just as the\r\nhorizon was becoming dimly visible through the rising mist, and silence\r\nwas reigning fore and aft--for both men and officers were tired out with\r\nsuspense and long watching--we were all startled and rendered as wide\r\nawake as ever we were in our lives. For, borne along on the morning\r\nair--breeze it could hardly be called--came a faint shout. One moment all\r\nhands listened: it was repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Shout, my lads,\" cried the captain, all his manhood returning at once;\r\nand such a ringing cheer was sent over the waters, as only could proceed\r\nfrom the lungs of Britain's sailors.\r\n\r\n[15]My! how every face brightened; and, my! how every eye glanced and\r\nglittered, as that boat loomed out from the fog. She was soon alongside,\r\nall hands were safe, and the first on board was _the skipper's imp_. There\r\nwas one old sailor who had been very quiet all the night, but who now\r\nburst into such sobbing as I never heard before. The poor man's son had\r\nbeen in the boat.\r\n\r\nDid we splice the main-brace? Rather. We spliced it on deck, and we went\r\nbelow to the ward-room and spliced it again; in fact that main brace took\r\na good deal of splicing, then we turned in and slept till noon, and I\r\ndreamt I was spliced myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIP ON FIRE.\r\n\r\nIf I remember rightly, we were somewhere in lat. 17° South, and a good\r\nway off land. We had been cracking on all the forenoon under steam, after\r\na Northern slave-ship, which we had finally boarded, captured, and taken\r\nin tow. A fine pair of heels she had shown us too. We had to burn hams to\r\nget within shot of her. But we did at last, and there she was, with a\r\nprize crew on board, and the fiery old Arabs glaring like evil spirits at\r\nus as they leaned over her taffrail. A breeze had sprung up towards four\r\no'clock, and the orders were given to bank fires and set sail. I was\r\nsitting in the ward-room reading, when--\r\n\r\n\"Look Jim!\" I heard some one on deck remark. \"Where is that thundering old\r\ncat going to now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bedad then,\" said Jim, \"but he's taking the rigging like a good one\r\nanyhow. Shouldn't wonder now if he was going to give us another spache.\"\r\n\r\nI ran up just in time to see the cat shin hand over hand up the main-top\r\ngallant mast, and seat himself on the very truck, in the exact spot he had\r\noccupied in his first adventure on board, when the captain fired at him.\r\n\r\nIt had gone three bells in the first dog watch;[16] we had just finished\r\ntea, and gone on deck to smoke our evening pipe. We were making ourselves\r\nvery comfortable on the stern gratings, and our Scotch engineer--naval\r\nengineers for the most part are Scotch--was singing \"For we are homeward\r\nbound;\" not that we were homeward bound by a long chalk, but it gave us\r\nthe idea we were, don't you know? and made us feel all the jollier, when\r\nthe quartermaster came aft, and addressing the officer of the watch--\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said, leisurely, turning his quid in his\r\nmouth, \"but I think, sir, there be a strong smell of fire right\r\namidships.\"\r\n\r\nWe went forward.\r\n\r\nThe second cutter lay bottom upwards, between the fore and main masts, and\r\nfrom under its gunnel were curling little puffs of light blue smoke, for\r\nall the world as if some one were smoking a cigar beneath the boat. But\r\nthe smoke had _the smell of burning wood_.\r\n\r\n_Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding._ Ah! had Edgar Allan Poe heard that\r\nbell, he might have added one other stanza to that strange wild poem of\r\nhis. _Ding, ding, ding, ding._ You never heard it, did you reader? Well,\r\nit is a pleasure you still have before you. The breeze was freshening\r\nevery minute, the sea was getting its back up, and darkness thickening\r\naround us. But what mattered darkness, we should soon light up old ocean\r\nwith our burning ship.\r\n\r\n_Ding, ding, ding_--up tumble the hands at the dread summons. The hoses\r\nare laid, the pumps rigged and manned as if by magic, and before the last\r\nsound of the bell is borne away on the breeze, every man is at quarters,\r\nsteady, grave, and silent--waiting. _Waiting?_ Aye; fancy having to wait\r\nfor a single moment, with the fire crackling under the broiling deck, and\r\ntons of powder under hatches. But service is service--the captain alone\r\nhas not responded to the alarm, and the officer of the watch has gone to\r\ncall him. Worthy man, he was--\r\n\r\n    \"Not fou, he just was glorious,\r\n  O'er a' the ills of life victorious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he said; \"ship's on fire, is she. Then go you to blazes.\"\r\n\r\nHe came up soon, however, and every man that night did his duty. Nothing\r\nin the world, save British pluck and coolness, could have conquered that\r\nfire. It was the padding at the back of the boiler that had caught, and\r\nburning through, had kindled the coals behind, and when the decks were\r\nscuttled, the scene below was like a red raging hell.\r\n\r\nIn less than two hours however, the flames were got under and the fire\r\nextinguished; and, saving the watch on deck, the crew, tired and bruised,\r\nand many of them scalded, had gone below, while the carpenters were busy\r\nrepairing decks; for in a man-of-war every trace of recent danger, whether\r\nfrom wind or fire or foe, is speedily erased.\r\n\r\nA shoal of sharks that had been following the ship expectant,\r\ndisappointed, sought deeper water, and black Tom, the cat, came down from\r\nhis perch on the main-truck, singing a song of deliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR MISHAPS.\r\n\r\nIt would take a long time indeed to narrate all the misadventures we had\r\nin that cruise. We got quite used to running on shore, being awakened any\r\nnight, with that strange grating noise beneath our keel, and the sudden\r\ncessation of all motion, which tells the experienced sailor better than\r\nwords can, that the ship has struck. One bright moonlight night, far on in\r\nthe middle watch, we ran aground on the Lyra reef. Luckily the tide was\r\nnot full nor the wind blowing. By next morning we had lowered the boats,\r\nand sent over the guns to lighten ship, and lay waiting for the tide. A\r\nbright sky, and a blue, blue sea all around, with never a sail in sight,\r\nnay, not even a bird. The waters so pellucid and clear, that leaning over\r\nthe bulwarks we could see the yellow sand at the bottom, see forests and\r\ngardens of marine plants, and flowers pink-petalled or tender green,\r\ngently waving to and fro in the current; see the transparent medusæ\r\ndisporting their rainbow beauties, and see the thousand and one\r\nstrange-looking tropical fishes, of colours so bright and shapes so\r\ngrotesque, that they seemed the fishes of our dreams, or caricatures of\r\nanimal life.\r\n\r\nFast and sure on that reef we lay for upwards of forty-eight hours, and it\r\nwas only by lightening the ship of coals, and buoying her with empty rum\r\ncasks that we got safely afloat at last. The men were in good spirits all\r\nthe time, because forsooth, the cat, was \"_singing like all possessed_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTHING TO EAT.\r\n\r\nIt was the last voyage of the cruise. We were steering from Zanzibar to\r\nthe Cape, under orders home. We had on board with us no less a personage\r\nthan the bishop of C---- A---- and his learned curate, Dr. Blank. Now we\r\nhad not been to sea over three days when, lo and behold! one-half, at\r\nleast, of the casks of beef and provisions, supposed to be full, were\r\nfound to be mere dummies. It was nobody's fault--it always is nobody's\r\nfault in a case of that sort--but the upshot of it was, that all hands\r\nwere put upon short allowance; and as our mess--having got into debt--was\r\njust then living on ship's provisions, we officers had to suffer the same\r\nprivations as the men. Besides, we had neither beer, wine, nor spirits on\r\nboard, very little water, and no coals to spare to distil more.\r\n\r\nThis was a very pretty look out for a three weeks' voyage, to the Cape, in\r\nmid-winter. And poor Tom came in for more cursing now than ever. Everybody\r\ncursed him everywhere; they cursed him below and cursed him aloft; cursed\r\nhim on the quarter-deck, and cursed him in the cook's galley. But Tom only\r\nsung the louder.\r\n\r\n\"It was all along of that blessed cat,\" the sailors said; and they added,\r\n\"that it was a good thing we had my lord bishop on board, to counteract\r\nthe evil effects of the skipper's imp.\" The poor bishop suffered too, but\r\nmostly from sea-sickness. He kept his bed all the voyage. He was a stout\r\nman at Zanzibar, but he got considerably thinner, before we reached the\r\nCape. But his curate was more to be pitied, he was a thin man, didn't get\r\nsick, and had a stomach like a brewer's horse; and the more sorrow for\r\nthat same, there being so little to put into it. Our biscuit must, I\r\nthink, have been baked before the flood, each morsel, while black with\r\ncockroaches' filth outside, entertaining a whole colony of weevils inside;\r\nwe ate the weevils, however, merely tapping each morsel on the table to\r\nget rid of the superabundant dust, before conveying it to our mouths. We\r\nhad neither potatoes nor butter. We had white beans though, and black rice\r\nand fried sardines, to which latter we used to add a little turmeric and\r\ncayenne by way of flavouring. We actually got mean in our hunger, and used\r\nto say little snappish things to each other, about our share of the\r\nvictuals; things which we would have been ashamed to say under any other\r\ncircumstances. No one, I can assure you, was above helping himself, to the\r\nlast spoonful of rice or beans, out of a delicate feeling of consideration\r\nfor his neighbour. In good sooth, sometimes three or four spoons, would\r\nmeet at the dish at once in most undignified haste.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" our little good-natured assistant paymaster would\r\nsay; \"better is a dinner of rice and fried sardines, where love is, than a\r\nstallëd ox and hatred therewith.\"\r\n\r\nWe should just have liked to have seen the stallëd ox, that's all. But\r\nthis assistant paymaster was a stout bulky little chap, and didn't suffer\r\nhalf what we did. I'm certain he lived on his own fat all the way to the\r\nCape, just as the sheep in the Highlands do, when they have the misfortune\r\nto be buried in the snow for a week or two. Our conversation all the\r\ndinner hour--when we weren't quarrelling--used to be about this glorious\r\nfeed, and the next glorious feed, which we once had; and it would\r\ncertainly have been amusing for an outsider--who wasn't hungry himself\r\nmind you--to have heard us, enlarging on all the dainties that had been\r\nset before us in happier times.\r\n\r\nOur conversation would have been somewhat after the following fashion:--\r\n\r\n_S._ \"But, by George, when I was in the P. & O. Co.'s Service--ay, old\r\nfellows, that was the place to live--there is where we used to get _the_\r\nspreads.\"\r\n\r\n_All._ \"Yes, yes; tell us, there's a dear boy. What had you for dinner?\"\r\n\r\n_S._ \"Well, you know, the bill of fare used to be two yards long, and a\r\nyard and a quarter wide. We had two soups, and then----\"\r\n\r\n_All._ \"No, no; tell us first what the soups were?\"\r\n\r\n_S._ \"Well, say vermicelli and macaro--Oh! hang it all, Moreton, that's\r\nthe third time to my certain knowledge, that you've helped yourself to\r\nrice.\"\r\n\r\n_Moreton._ \"To-morrow's pea-soup day, never mind.\"\r\n\r\n_S._ \"But I do mind.\"\r\n\r\n_All._ \"Go on with your yarn.\"\r\n\r\n_S._ \"Well, vermicelli and macaroni, and then a bit of delicious white\r\nturbot, with oyster sauce and----\"\r\n\r\n_All._ \"Yes, yes; go on.\"\r\n\r\n_S._ \"All very well to say go on; but I _shall_ have those three beans,\r\nyou greedy beggars. Well, then, after the fish came--\" etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhen S. had finished, R. would begin.\r\n\r\n\"That just reminds me of an hotel I was at in France,\" etc., and so each\r\none told his experiences, to the infinite delectation of his neighbours,\r\nand having locust-like devoured everything we came across, we used to get\r\nup hungry and haggard, and run on deck to smoke away the tail end of our\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nIn those days, our grace before and after meat was rather a peculiar one.\r\nThe president said the first; it was, \"Curse the cat.\" Then just before we\r\nrose from table, \"Mr. Vice, will you kindly return thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Confound_ the cat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE SKIPPER'S IMP.\r\n\r\nNo one ever saw the last of him, however; although a seaman, called Davis,\r\nswore point black, that he had seen the cat fly overboard in a sheet of\r\nblue flame; but then Davis was the biggest lubber and the greatest liar\r\nin the ship. The only thing known for certain is this: we were about three\r\ndays' sail from Symon's Town, Cape of Good Hope. The night was dark and\r\nthe weather squally, and poor Tom was last seen sitting, very quiet and\r\npensive-like, on the hammock nettings aft. He was seen there, I say, in\r\nthe middle watch; and he was never seen again alive or dead. The men swore\r\nroundly that he was a devil nothing more nor less, and that, being a\r\ndevil, he couldn't stomach my lord bishop on board, and consequently took\r\nFrench leave and went home. The truth, I suppose is, that the ship gave a\r\nnasty lee lurch, and Tom, half asleep, missed his footing, and tumbled\r\noverboard. I know the skipper was sorry.\r\n\r\nWe kept a good look out for the _Flying Dutchman_ after Tom's demise; but\r\nvery much to my disappointment, we did not fall in with that ghostly ship.\r\nIf I were merely writing a sailor's yarn, I should certainly say we had\r\nseen her, and give a most photographic-like description of her; but such\r\nstories I leave landsmen to tell, for I think if a man has been for ten or\r\na dozen years at sea, and kept his weather eye lifting all the time, it\r\nwill take him the remainder of his life to tell the whole _truth alone_.\r\n\r\nWhen we came down to the Cape, which we managed to do without any further\r\nadventures, there lay the new admiral's ship, all spick and span from\r\nEngland's shores, so all our fellows were turned over to, and went home in\r\nthe old Admiral's ship, all except our engineer and my unhappy self. We,\r\nmuch to our disgust, were reappointed to the saucy _Tickler_, which was to\r\nremain out for another commission, as tender to the new flagship. Now,\r\nhowever, we had a new captain, the jolliest little man alive; new\r\nofficers, and a new crew, and we were all as jolly as sandboys. The new\r\nofficers thought themselves tremendously clever chaps, and every night\r\nthey used all to pull off their slippers and go pell mell at the\r\nunfortunate cockroaches; but the engineer and I sat like stoics, and let\r\nthem crawl over us in scores, and if too many at one time came on the\r\nbook we might be reading, we gently removed them. But before a month was\r\nover, our messmates found out the futility, of trying to diminish the\r\nnumber of cockroaches, and these interesting creatures had _carte blanche_\r\nall over the ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TORTOISESHELL.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by MR. L. SMITH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER, or BLUE TABBY.\r\n\r\nFirst Prize--Owned by MR. REYNOLDS.]\r\n\r\nWe sailed for Bombay.\r\n\r\nBut though black Tom was no more, ill-luck seemed still to hover in the\r\nwake of that little vessel.\r\n\r\nI would willingly narrate our further adventures in detail, but somehow I\r\nhave no heart, now that the cat has left the story. But, how we were\r\ncaught in a gale off the Cape and the ship _taken aback_ (that, reader, is\r\nmuch more dreadful than it appears on paper), how we sprang a leak a week\r\nafter--glass falling and weather stormy, on a rock bound coast--and, just\r\nas the ship was beginning to stagger like a drunk man, and the boats were\r\ngot ready for lowering, the engineer--brave little man--dived below water\r\nin the engine-room, and found it was no leak at all, but the great\r\nsea-cock left open by a drunken stoker; how we ran on shore on that wild\r\nreef outside Johanna, and lay there for a whole week with our keel\r\nfloating in splinters around us; how, finally we got off, and steamed to\r\nBombay almost a wreck; the pumps going continually, and barely keeping her\r\nafloat; how we arrived safely through it all; how a liberal government\r\npaid rather more for repairing her, than would have bought a new one, and\r\nhow she was sold three years after for an old song,--is it not all written\r\nin the log of Her Majesty's saucy gunboat, _Tickler_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Zula,\" the property of Mrs. Captain Barrett-Lennard. This\r\ncat was brought from Abyssinia at the conclusion of the war, fed on the\r\nway home on raw beef, and was long very wild. She is now very fond of her\r\nmistress, but has a great many eccentricities which other cats have not,\r\nand is altogether a wonderful specimen of cat-kind.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI deem it fair both to myself and to the reader, to supplement my own\r\nevidence on the \"Curiosities of Cat Life,\" by giving the names and\r\naddresses of my authorities for those of my anecdotes, which may seem to\r\nrun contrary to the generally received opinions, concerning cats; at the\r\nsame time thanking those ladies and gentlemen, who have taken so much\r\ninterest in the progress of this work, and expressed themselves willing to\r\nvouch for the truth of the incidents herein related by me. I have tried\r\nto make the anecdotes as readable as possible, and as humorous, as I know\r\nmany people think \"cats\" a dry subject; _but in no single instance have\r\nthe interests of truth been disregarded_. My anecdotes are what might be\r\ncalled sample anecdotes, as I have many hundreds more of the same sort, my\r\nobject being to describe _pussy as she really is_, and thus to gain favour\r\nfor an animal hitherto understood only by the few, and abused by the many.\r\nAnd, nothing would give me greater pain, than the reader to have an idea,\r\nthat my cats are exceptional cats; for, I distinctly aver, _that no cat\r\nmentioned in this book, has either done or suffered anything, which any\r\nother cat in the kingdom cannot do or suffer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES.\r\n\r\nAnderson, Alex., Mr., New Fowlis, Crieff, N.B.\r\n\r\nAnderson, Jane, Miss, Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire.\r\n\r\nBird, Miss, Snowdon Place, Stirling.\r\n\r\nBonnar, T., Mr., Largoward, St. Andrews.\r\n\r\nBudge, W., Mr., 113, Montrose Street, Brechin.\r\n\r\nBurns, D., Mr., 19, Murray Road East, Finsbury Park, London.\r\n\r\nCatto, W.

I should think the\r\nphenomenon due to the reflection of star-rays, from a piece of rock\r\ncrystal; but the superstitious Skye men have a different opinion, and aver\r\nthat this light marks the entrance to the cave of the buried treasure. I\r\nhope they may find it. I strongly suspect, however, that the malignant\r\nfairy is nothing more nor less than a wild cat.\r\n\r\n_Note C._--Anecdote of the wild cat.

Having said\r\nthat Mr. Webb has carried out his programme to the letter, what remains\r\nfor us here is the recommendation that admirers of the canine race should\r\npurchase the book.

The book is written in a gossiping\r\nstyle, and is certain to be immensely popular, the information having been\r\nfurnished by some of the highest authorities in the kingdom.\"--_Sporting\r\nTimes, Nov. 28th, 1872._\r\n\r\n\"The points of good breeds are tersely stated, and beyond doubt, the book\r\nwill be useful to dog-fanciers; and who does not come more or less under\r\nthat designation?\"--_The Standard, Oct. 28th, 1872._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Henry Webb has compiled a book about dogs which will be found\r\nthoroughly interesting and instructive to owners and exhibitors of these\r\nfaithful animals.\"--_Lloyd's Newspaper, Nov. 17th, 1872._\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM BREEDERS' LETTERS.\r\n\r\n  _Scalford, Mowbray._\r\n\r\n\"The chapters on Bull Dogs, Bloodhounds, &c., &c., are excellent and\r\ntrustworthy.
