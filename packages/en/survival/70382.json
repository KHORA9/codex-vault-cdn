Observatory\r\nthrough the 60-inch reflector.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBEHOLD,--THE STARS!\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW thrilling to read of great hunts for treasure! Yet the pirates who\r\ndug their spades into the earthy loam never cached such jewels as are\r\nhidden along the dark slopes of the sky. Armed with a chart of the\r\nheavens, the fledgling astronomer prods about in the depths of the\r\ngloom, shovels the dark with the aid of his telescope, and\r\ndiscovers,--even more surely than the pirate his chest,--some wonderful\r\ntreasure. Sometimes the find is a star-like diamond, a twinkling\r\nemerald, a fire-filled ruby or a cluster of star gems of colorful hues,\r\nbut it may be, too, a profusion of riches, heaped in a magnificence that\r\nleaves one breathless.\r\n\r\nOne must know, however, before adventuring along the skyways, just where\r\nto look for these starry jewels. The air must also be clear and the eye\r\ncolor-true. In the tropics where the atmosphere is more transparent, the\r\ncolors seem deeper and more beautiful. This is also true on deserts, on\r\nthe ocean or on mountain tops.\r\n\r\nTo those who do not know that stars, even as jewels, have individuality,\r\nthe various colorings will come as a special surprise. _Vega_, for\r\ninstance, is large and most _wonderfully blue_, rising in the far\r\nnortheast during the first of May; _Arcturus_, appearing at the same\r\ntime near the zenith, is tinted like a _King Midas' rose_. On the first\r\nof June, _Antares_ glows like a scarlet-shaded lamp hung low in the\r\nsoutheast, while in the northeast, _creamy-hued Capella_\r\nscintillates like the electrified cross-section of a rainbow. In the\r\ncase of a double star where the colors are sharply contrasted--gold and\r\nblue or scarlet and green--the effect is startling and very beautiful.\r\nWeird looking purple stars and wan lavender ones may also be found, but\r\nall these lovely tints and shades are hidden among the hosts of more\r\ncommon yellow and white stars, and if one does not know just where to\r\nfind them it is like hunting for treasure without a chart.\r\n\r\nWhen the world was young, people gazed in never-ending wonder as the\r\ndarkness of the heavens filled up with the lights of stars. According to\r\nan old Malayan story the stars were the children of the Moon-mother, who\r\nbrought her children out only at night when the jealous sun, who had no\r\nchildren, was far away on the other side of the earth. The ancient\r\nGreeks believed that night came because the God of the Sun drove his\r\nsun-chariot along the invisible edge of the western ocean when he\r\nreturned from the west to the east. All the natural laws of Nature were\r\nexplained in some such naïve manner by the ancient peoples; the imagery\r\nof the Greeks is especially interesting, for they impressed shadowy\r\nfigures on the very stars. These figures have given names to the\r\nconstellations, or groups of stars, and to the student of Nature, the\r\nlegends of these heroes traced in the sky add to the charm of the stars\r\nin the same manner that the delicate aroma of the rose enhances its\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\nLater, these remarkable people, in trying to account for the fixed and\r\norderly movement of the stars as they slowly passed from east to west,\r\nadduced that they must be fastened in crystal spheres which whirled, one\r\nwithin the other, over and under the motionless disk of the earth. They\r\nnoted that a few of these luminaries followed a wandering course, and so\r\ncalled them \"planets\"--which means \"wandering stars.\" Since some of\r\nthese wandering stars moved swiftly and others moved more slowly, they\r\nfancied, in their beautiful way of explaining things, that these\r\ndifferent rates of speed must cause a musical tone as each star rolled\r\nupon its crystal, a deep note for the slow bodies and a high note for\r\nthe swift bodies, and that with the infinite swelling harmony of all the\r\nmyriad stars, one vast sweeping tone of heavenly music swirled around\r\nthe spheres. But this music was for the gods and no mortal could hear\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOur modern music of the spheres is no more audible to our dulled ears\r\nthan the music of those ancient days, yet its silent song of light and\r\ncolor, its mystic setting of ancient tales, and its wonder background of\r\nscientific fact, descends in the same sweet way to all hearts lifted to\r\nreceive it. Yet many people miss all this and only know that the stars\r\nare there.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to become acquainted with the more conspicuous of the\r\nstar-designs which are formed by the brightest stars in a constellation\r\nfor these seem to hang down from the dome of heaven like electrically\r\nlighted frames. Some of these, such as the \"W\" of Cassiopeia, the\r\n\"Square\" of Pegasus, the \"parallelogram\" of Orion, the Northern Cross\r\nand the Big Dipper, are not only ornaments in the sky, but serve also as\r\nguides to point the way to other constellations.\r\n\r\nAn endeavor has been made to arrange the constellations in this volume\r\nin the most easily-learned-without-effort way that could possibly be\r\ndevised, and to present them in such a manner that the student will go\r\nout of doors with a picture of the position of the stars in his mind so\r\nthat in more advanced study sky maps will acquire a new significance.\r\n\r\nFirst the stars in the vicinity of the North Star are discussed--the two\r\nstarry Bears and _Draco_, the Dragon; then the great sky drama of\r\nPerseus and Andromeda, with _Cepheus_, the King of Ethiopia,\r\n_Cassiopeia_, the Queen, _Pegasus_, the Flying Horse and _Cetus_, the\r\nterrible Sea-monster; the \"parade of the zenith constellations\"\r\nled by _Leo_, the fierce Nemean Lion; the constellations on either side\r\nof this interesting spectacle; the four great southern stars, each noted\r\nenough to have the stage by itself, and the gorgeous winter program with\r\nthe brilliant stars of the Giant _Orion_, _Taurus_, the Bull, and\r\n_Castor_ and _Pollux_, the Heavenly Twins.\r\n\r\nWhirling about the sun in the same plane as the earth are seven other\r\nplanets. These planets resemble stars to the unaided eye but show a\r\ndefinite disk through the telescope. With but the expenditure of an idle\r\nmoment now and then, who would not like to learn a few facts about\r\nJupiter, a world with nine moons and a thousand times larger than the\r\nearth; Saturn, a globe surrounded by a magnificent ring and composed of\r\nsuch diaphanous material that it would float on water; Mars, with its\r\nmysterious surface markings; Venus, shrouded in the secret of its\r\nimpenetrable atmosphere; the hundreds of tiny worlds, some but a few\r\nmiles across, and even the raging sun itself with its hydrogen flames,\r\nspots, moving belts and other idiosyncrasies?\r\n\r\nThese are only suggestions of what may be anticipated in our treasure\r\nhunt along the slopes of the sky, but every star that has once been\r\nfound and called by name will stand forth from the multitude with a\r\nmagnetic radiance that forever after thrills the discoverer with the\r\npride of achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAN INTRODUCTION TO THE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_He who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground, the waters--the\r\nplanets, the heavens, and how to come at these enchantments, is the rich\r\nand royal man._\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Emerson_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE dome of the heavens with its constellations of stars turns westward\r\nat the rate of about 15 degrees an hour.\r\n\r\nThus the stars, in unchanging order, rise majestically above the horizon\r\nin the east, wend their way across the great expanse of sky above our\r\nheads, and disappear below the horizon in the west. It is only necessary\r\nto note the position of a particularly bright star or a conspicuous\r\nconstellation lying near the horizon and then return after several hours\r\nhave elapsed and again note its position in the sky to prove this\r\ngeneral movement toward the west. This is an interesting experiment for\r\nit is often a surprise to people to hear that the stars of the heaven\r\nare constantly shifting their position throughout the hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach star has an individual pathway which describes an arc across the\r\nheavens, the exception to this being the circum polar stars which\r\ndescribe complete circles around a point north of the zenith.\r\n\r\nThe center indicated by the curved pathways of the stars is called the\r\nPole of the Heavens, and in the northern hemisphere this important\r\nlocation is marked by the North Star. The North Star, also called\r\n_Polaris_ or the Pole Star, lies almost directly above the north\r\npole of the earth, and is located in the sky by the \"pointers\" on the\r\nbowl of the Big Dipper. \r\n[Figure 02] \r\nSince we cannot realize the whirling of the earth on its axis which \r\ncauses the heavenly bodies to appear to pass in the opposite direction, \r\nit is the same to us as if the axis of the earth continued upward to \r\nPolaris, thus causing this star to seem to stand still, while all the \r\nother stars in the course of twenty-four hours seem to whirl in fixed \r\norbits around it. \r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The earth in circling round the moving sun,\r\n    Seems to give motion to the nearer stars,\r\n    Bending the tracks they trace across the sky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis remarkable performance may be photographed on a clear, moonless\r\nnight if a camera is properly focused on the North Star and left exposed\r\nin that position for two or three hours. The photograph thus obtained\r\nwill consist of a series of circular trails around the central star.\r\nThese are produced by the stars moving slowly over the plate in\r\nconsequence of their changing positions,--just as if the stars instead\r\nof our own little world had really moved. This is what the ancient\r\npeoples believed and in the words of Aratus\r\n\r\n\r\n\"the axis shifts not a whit, but unchanging is forever fixed, and in the\r\nmidst of it holds the earth in equipoise, and wheels the heavens itself\r\naround.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the stars were always in the same order with reference to one\r\nanother, it was thought that perhaps these luminaries were the heads of\r\ngolden nails which made the heavenly dome secure. Thus through their\r\napparent immovability, they acquired the name of \"fixed\" stars, although\r\nthis fixity has long since been disproved.\r\n\r\nThe stars nearest to the North Star complete their circles above the\r\nhorizon and are called circumpolar stars. The Big Dipper, the Little\r\nDipper, Draco and the \"W\" of Cassiopeia are star groups which do\r\nthis for an observer in the north temperate latitudes. If watched\r\nthroughout the night any one of these star groups may be seen to\r\ncomplete half of its circle around the North Star, although the other\r\nhalf of the journey would be invisible on account of the daylight.\r\n\r\nAlthough the circumpolar stars may be seen to complete their pathways\r\nabove the horizon, the pathways of all the other stars are completed on\r\nthe other side of the earth,--the greater the distance from the North\r\nStar, the larger their arcs above the horizon, until the distance of 90\r\ndegrees is reached. This greatest curve is shown by the stars which rise\r\nalmost directly in the east. The stars which rise south of east have\r\nonly a small portion of their pathways visible.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that since the stars move as a complete unit, the aspect\r\nof the star dome would appear the same at the same hour of the night\r\nthroughout the year. But this is known not to be the case for in\r\nconsequence of the earth's motion around the sun, or the apparent\r\nadvance of the sun among the stars, the same position of the stars\r\nre-occurs four minutes earlier each day, and the star groups appear a\r\nlittle farther west at a given hour each evening. They appear at the\r\nsame time only after the lapse of a year. This is the reason that the\r\ndates and hours for the appearance of the different stars are given in\r\nthe star maps. Since four minutes a day total up to two hours a month, a\r\nstar seen to rise at ten o'clock in one month will be seen to rise at\r\neight o'clock the next month, and at six o'clock the following month,\r\nand so on through the daylight at the rate of two hours a month, until\r\nit has again worked back to a place in the darkness of the evening sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of the stars is beyond determination, but those visible to\r\nthe unaided eye amount to only a few thousands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany stars on the border-line of invisibility send us flickering glints\r\nof light although seldom can we clearly see more than two thousand at\r\none time and usually many of these are blotted out by the thick veil of\r\natmosphere which surrounds the earth.\r\n\r\nAmong the exceptionally bright stars which may be seen from the northern\r\nhemisphere are:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Arcturus (in Boötes)          Regulus (in Leo)\r\n    Aldebaran (in Taurus)         Vega (in Lyra)\r\n    Altair (in Aquila)            Antares (in Scorpio)\r\n    Betelgeuse (in Orion)         Rigel (in Orion)\r\n    Capella (in Auriga)           Sirius (in Canis Major)\r\n    Procyon (in Canis Minor)      Spica (in Virgo)\r\n    Deneb (in Cygnus)             Formalhaut (in Piscis Australis)\r\n\r\n\r\nYet even these cannot be seen at the same time but must be viewed from\r\ndifferent parts of the earth's journey around the sun.\r\n\r\nThese brightest stars, which are called first magnitude stars, should be\r\namong one's first star acquaintances, for they serve conveniently as\r\nguides to locate the other stars, which are also classified according to\r\nmagnitudes. The second, third, fourth and lesser magnitudes are each\r\nprogressively two and a half times lower in the scale of brightness. The\r\nsmallest stars discernible to the unaided eye of ordinary vision are\r\nstars of the fifth magnitude, although a sharp eye can discern those of\r\nthe sixth and even of the seventh magnitude. All below this are\r\ntelescopic stars. With a 60-inch reflector 219,000,000 stars are\r\nvisible. The Mount Wilson 101-inch telescope brings the number up to\r\n319,000,000. Stars are most dense in the region of the heavens called\r\nthe Milky Way. Sir William Herschel observed 116,000 go past the field\r\nof his telescope in a quarter of an hour while directed at the densest\r\npart of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vast collection of stars differ not only in brightness but also in\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colors of the stars are brought out most vividly in the telescope if\r\nthe observer knows just where to look for those which are the most\r\npronounced. Some of the large stars are characterized by the most\r\nexquisite coloring,--which is sometimes further enhanced, as a glass\r\nwill reveal, by a charming companion of a flamboyant or a delicate hue.\r\nSome of these \"companions\" are green, blue, orange, purple, gray, maroon\r\nand other colors, but such gayety is the exception rather than the rule.\r\nAbout three-fourths of the stars are white or bluish-white and nearly\r\none-fourth of them are varying shades of yellow. The star Arcturus is of\r\nthe deepest shade of yellow while the star Spica is so exceedingly white\r\nthat poets and writers from the earliest times have spoken of the\r\n\"purity\" of its rays.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough every star visible to the unaided eye may be identified by a\r\nGreek letter or a number, most of the brightest stars have individual\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThese individual names were given by the Arabian astronomers who\r\nnurtured astronomy through the Dark Ages when this science was almost\r\nforgotten by the rest of the world. These odd names have a certain\r\nappeal and many of them possess rippling musical qualities which add to\r\nthe plain word as twinkles add to the star. It is a pleasure to say\r\n'Capella,' or 'Antares,' when we see the gleam of the \"Shepherd's Star,\"\r\nor the glow on the \"Heart of the Scorpion\"; or to call such jewels as\r\nshine on \"Orion's Belt,\" 'Mintaka,' 'Alnilam' and 'Alnitak.' After the\r\nintroduction one naturally takes a particular interest in 'Capella,' or\r\n'Antares,' or 'Mintaka,' or 'Alnilam,' and continues to refer to it\r\nfamiliarly by name.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach star not only attains a certain charm and individuality by having\r\nits own particular name, number, magnitude, color and pathway, but\r\nit also forms a part of a highly interesting group called a\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nOn a clear night points of starlight seem to fairly fill the sky, yet it\r\nwill be found, on careful examination, that the brightest of them often\r\nseem to be assembled together in a very picturesque manner, forming the\r\noutlines of figures such as the Dippers, the Crown, the Cross, the\r\nSickle or the Lyre. Since these designs unfailingly deck the heaven's\r\ndome at the same place, hour and season each year, there is not the\r\nhopeless confusion among the stars that the novice might think from his\r\noccasional glances at the sky.\r\n\r\nThese star groups, or constellations, were probably first noted and\r\nnamed in Chaldea where the ancient shepherds amused themselves by\r\ntracing their heroes among the stars. One can well imagine the hold that\r\nthese dream-pictures would have on a lonely shepherd as he wandered\r\nabout the solitudes of the hills and gazed through the quietness of the\r\nnight at the distant stars. For long ages these stories were told by one\r\nshepherd to another and so vivid were their fancies and so keenly were\r\nthey enjoyed that they made an indelible impress upon the folk-lore of\r\nother nations and in this manner have been carried down to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars are self-luminous, like our sun,--indeed, the stars are\r\ndistant suns, and the sun is a nearby star.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the star or sun around which the earth and the\r\nother planets of our solar system whirl, all the other suns are so\r\nimmensely remote from the earth that their huge diameters dwindle to a\r\nmere twinkle of light. The diameters of some of the stars have been\r\nmeasured and have been found to vary from a few thousand miles to many\r\nmillion miles. Our sun, a most medium sized star, has also been measured\r\nand has a diameter of 866,000 miles; this diameter, as seen from\r\nany other system of planets, would also dwindle to a twinkle, and our\r\ngreat sun would thus be lost among the other stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the sky are young stars, adult stars, and stars whose light\r\nhas almost flickered out, for stars, we find, even as all other things\r\nin Nature, have a limited span of life. This life may last for untold\r\nages but as surely as stars are formed, so do they die.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of a star is formed by gas under high pressure. This gas is\r\ngathered together by the force of gravity and gradually condensed into a\r\nglowing ball. In contracting the stars at first rise in temperature but\r\nwhen too advanced condensation retards this contraction, then the star\r\ngradually cools.\r\n\r\nRecent studies have revealed the fact that stars when young are huge and\r\nred. This early stage is called the giant stage. Antares, Betelgeuse,\r\nArcturus and Aldebaran are examples of stars at the beginning of their\r\ncareers. The giant red stars are gaseous throughout and of enormous\r\nvolume--Antares, the youngest and by far the largest of the four named\r\nabove, being 400,000,000 miles in diameter. The bluish stars are the\r\nhottest stars; a red tinge indicates comparative coolness whether the\r\nstar is young or old. The blue stars are in the prime of life, intensely\r\nhot and brilliant, and glow with a temperature of perhaps 10,000 degrees\r\nat their luminous surfaces. With a gradual rise and fall of temperature,\r\nstars burn, even as earthly flames, through a continuous series of\r\ncolors,--generally speaking, red, yellow, blue, yellow, red,--all of\r\nwhich bear a special meaning to an astronomer. The yellow stars, like\r\nour sun, are middle-aged; the dwarf red stars, old, like a dying ember.\r\nAfter a star has expended its heat, if it does not in the meantime meet\r\nwith some accident, it becomes a darkened, lifeless and cold-surfaced\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 03: AN IRREGULAR NEBULA IN SCUTUM SOBIESKI.\r\nPhotograph by Mount Wilson Observatory through 60-inch reflecting\r\ntelescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material believed to condense into great hot stars is scattered\r\nabout in various sections of the sky. This material has somewhat the\r\nappearance of a summer-day cloud or an illuminated daub of paint,\r\noccasionally as shapeless as a pinch of cotton; however, these objects,\r\ncalled nebulæ, have, as a rule, a definite form, the most common being\r\nthe 'spiral,' the 'ring' and the 'planetary,' these terms also being the\r\ndescriptive names of such nebulæ. But most of the nebulæ are not for\r\nordinary folks to see for they lie at such vast distances that they are\r\nonly visible in a large telescope. Sometimes stars are disclosed\r\nenmeshed in nebulous folds or again the nebula is seemingly sprinkled\r\nwith the gold of stars, and there is one object of this kind that every\r\namateur may locate. This is the Great Nebula of Orion which stretches\r\nover the whole of the huge constellation of Orion but is concentrated at\r\nthe star at the center of the Sword which swings from the Giant's Belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"I never gazed upon it but I dreamt\r\n    Of some vast charm concluded in that star\r\n    To make fame nothing.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Tennyson_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nebula of Orion may be seen in the south in the wintertime with a\r\ncomparatively small telescope. With a large telescope it is one of the\r\nmost beautiful and awe-inspiring sights in all the sky.\r\n\r\nOne theory of the life cycle of a star has it born \"of nebulous vapor\r\nand dead as a tiny, shrunken old sun\" and thus the order of evolution\r\nwould be from nebulæ to extinct stars, but some astronomers believe\r\nthat stars may change back to nebulæ, \"thus forming a universe having\r\nno beginning and no end\".\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earth travels in a long journey around the sun. This was surmised by\r\nCopernicus in 1530 and proved by Kepler and Galileo about 1610.\r\nBefore this the earth was supposed to be the center about which the\r\nuniverse moved.\r\n\r\n[Figure 04]\r\nThe star scenes along this tremendous journey, which covers 576,000,000\r\nmiles and requires a year to complete, vary with the seasons of the\r\nyear--yet year after year as we retrace the same path, the same familiar\r\nstars shine in the same familiar groups, each appearing in its set\r\nposition in the east and at the same time each season.\r\n\r\nViewed through the window of the earth's cold and icy atmosphere, the\r\nstars seen during the winter part of the journey seem to scintillate\r\nwith particular brilliancy. Since we are then passing by the most\r\ncolorful stars and the most spectacular star groups the gorgeousness of\r\nthese scenes is unequaled. During the summer the stars are more demure\r\nand tranquil in their light but their soft fires gleam with the gold of\r\nromance which the ancient people cast about them in journeys of the\r\npast. After once recognizing a few of these constellations or beholding\r\nthrough a telescope the glories of a double star or the face of a\r\ndistant world, one will never again fail through indifference to raise\r\nhis eyes to the heavens. There is one thing certain--if all the wondrous\r\nphenomena of visible stars could be seen on but one of the nights of our\r\nlong ride about the sun, the civilized world would spend its last cent\r\non glasses and sit up until dawn to feast its eyes on the sublimity of\r\nthe spectacle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF THE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the vividness of their fancy, intensified by glorious scenery and\r\nsunny skies, the ancient Greeks believed that the gods dwelt on the\r\nsummit of Mount Olympus and that queer and lovely beings roamed about\r\nthe land. They heard the raging of the Wind-gods, the dancing feet of\r\nwood nymphs, the trip, trip, trip of satyrs and the music of Pandean\r\npipes as this merry god went skipping over hill and lea. They knew that\r\nnaiads peeped from the mist in fountains and dryads lived in the hearts\r\nof trees, while down in the sea, Neptune tossed up the billows with his\r\ntrident and the little sea-maids sat in them and rocked and sang.\r\nHeroes, semi-divine, swept the earth of its monsters, while gods in\r\ngolden chariots attended to the welfare of mankind. So deeply sincere\r\nwas this mythological faith that great temples and beautiful shrines\r\nwere built in honor of the gods, and one can scarce find a spot in all\r\nof Greece, or in all the sky that hangs over Greece, that is not\r\nhallowed by some wonderful legend.\r\n\r\nThis beloved country was thought to lie on the center of the earth,\r\nwhich was marked by the oracle of Apollo, at Delphi. In those days, the\r\nearth was supposed to hang like a disk in the great hollow globe of the\r\nworld, its land divided into two parts by the Mediterranean Sea and its\r\nedges washed by the turbulent river of the ocean. The upper part of this\r\nglobe was illuminated by the sun, moon and stars and was called Heaven,\r\nbut the lower part extended below the earth-disk and formed a terrifying\r\npit of utter darkness. The Milky Way was a road which led to the home of\r\nthe gods, but this pit was a place of dire punishment.\r\n\r\nOne of the many duties of the gods was to see that the earth was\r\nproperly lighted by the sun and the moon, and that the stars were\r\n\"penned in\" at dawn and \"unpenned\" nightly. The sun, moon and stars rose\r\nand sank in the stream of the ocean, but the sun, instead of being\r\nsubmerged, was carried around the stream from west to east in a winged\r\ncup or golden boat made by the god Vulcan.\r\n[Figure 05]\r\nIt was at first thought that Vulcan, with a mighty heave, threw the hot\r\nsun-ball over the Caucasus mountains in the east to the Atlantic ocean\r\nin the west, and then hastily paddled around the world stream to catch\r\nit as it fell, but later it was believed that Apollo, the Sun-god, drove\r\nit across the sky in a chariot, the return journey to the country of the\r\nsunrise being accomplished by placing both chariot and sun in Vulcan's\r\nremarkable boat. Centuries later (about 336 B. C.) Eudoxus evolved the\r\ntheory of the concentric crystalline spheres which brought the tracks of\r\nthe heavenly bodies under and above the motionless disk of the\r\nearth with the stars rolling round in long-drawn notes of celestial\r\nsweetness audible only to the gods.\r\n\r\nThe ancient people imagined that before the earth was smoothed out flat\r\nin its present attractive form, the whole world was tumbled together in\r\ngreat confusion,--land, air, sea, sky, hot, cold, soft, hard, light and\r\nheavy all mixed and melting in a desolate mass presided over by the god\r\nChaos. Chaos was dethroned by the God of Darkness, who in turn was\r\ndethroned by Light and Day. Light and Day, being orderly, industriously\r\nsorted the earth from the sea and extracted the heavens from both. The\r\nfiery part was cast into the sky where it splintered into stars, while\r\nthe earth, \"a lifeless lump, unfashion'd and unfram'd,\" was heaped in a\r\nbig, broad mound with a deep and terrifying stream of waters flowing\r\naround it. Then Uranus, the Heavens, noting his superior position, took\r\nthe scepter away from Light and Day and became the first ruler of the\r\ncreated world. Love was then born and the Earth, entranced, hemmed in\r\nher valleys and extended her plains, made paths for the rivers and beds\r\nfor the lakes. The seeds, relieved of weight, burst their coverings, and\r\nthe hills became green with foliage and the meadows brilliant with\r\nflowers. The world was now beautiful, and Heaven looked down on the\r\ncolorful earth, and Earth looked up into the starry eyes of Heaven, and\r\nlove grew, and the Earth became the Heaven's bride.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, Uranus began to seriously consider his numerous\r\nand somewhat fearful progeny, for the huge Titans, the one-eyed Cyclops\r\nand the hundred-handed giants were here and there and everywhere about\r\nthe land. Foreseeing that his sovereignty might eventually become\r\nimperiled, he picked up the Cyclops and Hecatoncheires and thrust them\r\nout of sight into the Pit of Darkness.\r\n\r\nSuch heartless conduct on the part of her husband aroused the\r\nwrath of Mother Earth, who urged the Titans to revolt against their\r\nfather and release their brothers from the Pit. But the Titans looked at\r\nthe great Sky and were afraid, all except one huge giant named Saturn\r\nwho picked up a keen-edged scythe and frightened his father into\r\nsubmission. Saturn then appropriated the throne and made Rhea his\r\nQueen,--although he prudently swallowed all of the children that were\r\nborn to him lest they in turn might take the throne. By the time\r\nJupiter, her sixth child, was born, Saturn's wife was aroused to such a\r\npoint of opposition that she concealed a stone in the infant's clothes\r\nand hid the 'mighty babe.' Jupiter, however, expressed himself so\r\nvigorously and so continuously that Rhea, in desperation, sent him away\r\nfrom Mount Olympus, the home of the gods, to an island named Crete,\r\nlying to the south of Greece. Here he was fed on honey, milk and\r\nambrosia while his attendants danced and clattered and kept up a\r\nperpetual din. This concealment was quite necessary, for his uncles, the\r\nTitans, had now become a powerful race of giants and had decreed that\r\nnot one of Saturn's heirs, but one of themselves would succeed to the\r\nthrone. His nurses, by the way, and the goat with which he played, were\r\nafterwards placed in the sky as a reward for their kindness, the nurses,\r\naccording to one legend, being accorded a position on the \"V\" of stars\r\nin the constellation of Taurus, while the goat was placed in the arms of\r\nthe shepherd in Auriga.\r\n\r\nWhen the Titans discovered that they had been deceived and that a child\r\nof Saturn's was among them, they rushed with furious war-cries upon\r\nOlympus. Hearing the commotion from the island of Crete, Jupiter rushed\r\nto the aid of his father, and so confident and strenuous was this\r\npowerful child, that the surprised Titans turned and fled. The young god\r\nthen displayed an inherited trait and helped himself to his father's\r\nkingdom and the golden palace on the top of the mountain.\r\n\r\nAfter establishing his sovereignty over the world and rescuing his\r\nbrothers and sisters through the aid of a powerful potion, he called\r\nNeptune and Pluto into his presence and made Neptune God of the Sea, and\r\nPluto God of the Underworld. These three deities were then armed with\r\npowerful weapons for Jupiter could hurl his thunderbolts and flash his\r\nlightnings, Pluto walk about in the security of a hat of darkness, and\r\nNeptune stir up the sea, or calm it, by means of a three-pronged spear.\r\nThe Titans, now thoroughly cowed, were punished in various ways, some\r\nbeing imprisoned in the Pit of Darkness with their brothers, the sons of\r\nUranus, while others were doomed to work without ceasing on servile\r\ntasks for the gods. Atlas, the tallest, was commanded to stand on the\r\nwestern extremity of the earth and bear the vault of heaven on his head\r\nand shoulders. His station was later said to be in the Atlas mountains\r\nin Africa. Aeschylus, an ancient writer, claims that the daughters of\r\nAtlas and their mother, the nymph Pleone, fled to the sky in sorrow when\r\nAtlas was forced to undergo this terrible punishment. The seven\r\ndaughters, now styled the Pleiades, represent one of our most beautiful\r\nstar groups.\r\n\r\nNow when Mother Earth heard of the high-handed ways of her grandson,\r\nJupiter, she decided that she would give him a much needed lesson, so\r\ngathering together the most terrible of the giants among Uranus' sons,\r\nshe incited them to start another great war. This war lasted ten years,\r\nthe giants proving so formidable that Jupiter summoned the one-eyed\r\nCyclops and the hundred-handed sons of grandfather Uranus to come to his\r\naid. The Hecatoncheires gave immediate assistance by flinging rocks with\r\nall their three-hundred hands at once while the Cyclops forged\r\nthunderbolts as fast as Jupiter could handle them. In the thick of this\r\nbombardment, which left debris and bowlders strewn all over Thessaly,\r\nthe giants balanced Mount Pelion on the summit of Mount Ossa, which lay\r\nbetween Pelion and Olympus, in a final effort to storm the home of\r\nthe Gods, but Jupiter, hurling his thunderbolts, struck Ossa from under\r\nPelion and buried the giants beneath the ponderous mass. The violence of\r\nthis battle shook the foundations of the world:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \"the immeasurable sea\r\n    Roared: earth resounded: the wide heaven throughout\r\n    Groaned shattering: from its base Olympus vast\r\n    Reeled to the violence of the Gods: the shock\r\n    Of deep concussion rocked the dark abyss\r\n    Remote of Tartarus:\"\r\n\r\n                             --_The Theogony--Hesiod_.\r\n\r\n                                 (_Trans. by_ ELTON.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly one giant escaped, a terrible monster named Typhon, who picked up a\r\nwhole mountain in a paroxysm of supernatural rage and hurled it at his\r\nadversaries. He was finally subdued, after a terrible struggle, by a\r\nthunderbolt from Olympus, which knocked him into the sea. There the gods\r\nlashed him with the Lightnings of Jupiter and heaped the vast\r\nthree-cornered island of Sicily upon his limbs, two of the corners\r\nweighing down his arms and the third one crushing his feet, while his\r\nhead was entombed beneath Mount Etna which hurled off its crown to let\r\nout his fiery breath. The lame god Vulcan took advantage of this\r\nsituation and henceforth used the location for his workshop where he\r\nforged many wonderful works of art within its fires.\r\n\r\nThis last war left Jupiter reigning in peace. He was the greatest of the\r\ndeities, the king of gods and men; he watched over the state and family;\r\nhis hand wielded the lightnings and guided the stars; and, in short, he\r\nregulated the whole course of Nature. Since the world soon became far\r\nenough advanced to understand natural phenomena, he was also the last of\r\nthe Olympian rulers. He is probably the best known of any of the gods\r\nand one finds many of the stories of his loves and adventures\r\nimmortalized in the skies. His daughter Urania was the Muse of\r\nAstronomy, and is represented with a celestial globe, to which she\r\npoints with a little staff.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Jupiter's father, Saturn, the God of Time, there was\r\nso much happiness in the world that it was called the \"Golden Age.\"\r\nHesiod mentions five ages--the Golden, simple and patriarchal; the\r\nSilver, voluptuous and godless; the Brazen, warlike, wild and violent;\r\nthe Heroic, an aspiration toward the better; and the Iron, in which\r\njustice, piety, and faithfulness had vanished from the earth. Ovid omits\r\nthe Heroic Age. The Golden Age was said to be governed by Saturn; the\r\nSilver, by Jupiter; the Brazen, by Neptune; and the Iron, by Pluto. An\r\n\"Age\" was regarded as a division of the great world year, which would be\r\ncompleted when the stars and planets had performed a revolution around\r\nthe heavens, after which destiny would repeat itself in the same series\r\nof events. Thus mythology was brought into connection with astronomy. It\r\nwas believed that successive conflagrations and deluges were designed by\r\nthe gods to purify the earth from guilt, and that after each of these\r\njudgments man was again so regenerated as to live for a time in a state\r\nof virtue and happiness. During the Golden Age, the year was one\r\ncontinued springtime, and the earth, \"as yet unwounded by the\r\nplowshare,\" produced of its own accord. This was followed by the Silver\r\nAge where spring was \"but a season of the year\" and the \"wings of wind\r\nwere clogged with ice and snow\" driving shivering mortals into houses.\r\nNext came the Brazen Age, a \"warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage,\"\r\nand last of all the Iron Age when again--according to Dryden's\r\ntranslation of Ovid's Metamorphoses--landmarks were set up \"limiting to\r\neach his right,\" and not satisfied with the blessings of earth men\r\ngreedily rummaged beneath the soil for the precious ore the gods had\r\nwisely hidden next to Tartarus. This ungrateful race was then destroyed\r\nby Jupiter, who sank their country and formed a new people to take\r\ntheir place. In the meantime, all the gods and goddesses had left the\r\nearth, Astræa, Goddess of Justice and Purity, remaining to the last.\r\nWhen man finally became so inferior that he engaged in strife and\r\ndiscord, this goddess hid her face in sorrow and flew upward to the sky\r\nwhere she took her place among the stars of the constellation of the\r\nVirgin.\r\n\r\nOvid describes the Milky Way as being the great road which led to the\r\npalaces of the gods which were clustered about the lofty, cloud-hidden\r\nsummit of Mount Olympus. In these golden homes with their ivory halls\r\nand furniture which possessed self-motion, dwelt Jupiter, Supreme Ruler\r\nof Heaven and Earth; Juno, his wife; Mars, the God of War; Venus,\r\nMinerva, Mercury and all the other gods and goddesses and many lesser\r\ndeities. They drank nectar, poured by Hebe or Ganymede, and ate\r\nambrosia, which gave immortal life. Their statures were immense, for\r\nwhen Jupiter shook the locks of his hair the stars trembled, but they\r\noften disguised themselves as earthly beings and mingled with mankind.\r\nAt times they issued commands through the voice of an oracle, or\r\ndisplayed anger through some exhibition of nature, such as when Jupiter\r\nthrew his thunderbolts.\r\n\r\nAlthough Apollo, Neptune and Pluto sometimes met in council at Olympus,\r\nthese three gods had their principal palaces in quite a different part\r\nof the earth, Apollo's being beyond the \"Land of the Sunrise,\" Neptune's\r\nunder the sea and Pluto's under the ground.\r\n\r\nAround Neptune's palace waved his lawns of seaweed and his trees of\r\ncoral while the currents were the breezes which fanned and cooled his\r\nbrow. His scepter was a trident with which he raised and stilled storms\r\nwhile his chariot was a shell drawn by brazen-hoofed sea-horses.\r\nDolphins, tritons and sea-monsters made sportive homage about his watery\r\npath and sea-nymphs played among his rocks and grottoes or sat on the\r\nshore in the moonlight drying their long, bright hair. Neptune married\r\none of these, a lovely dark-eyed nymph named Amphitrite and made\r\nher Goddess of the Sea. The dolphin which carried him during his\r\ncourtship was rewarded by being placed on a diamond-shaped group of\r\nstars which have ever since been called \"Delphinus, the Dolphin.\"\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Pluto, the Ruler of the Shades, was a level, cloudy\r\ncountry under the ground and was inhabited by pale, fleeting shadows,\r\nthe spirits of those who had died in the country on top of the ground.\r\nAcross the meadows of this dreary land wandered the river of Sighs and\r\nthe river of Forgetfulness,--but the flaming river of Phlegethon, with\r\nits sulphurous smoke and its waves of fire, flowed in an endless circle\r\nabout the walls of Tartarus where the wicked groaned and clanked their\r\nchains. If a soul was not condemned by the three judges, who weighed the\r\ngood and evil deeds in their scales, it was led to a place of happiness\r\ncalled the Elysian Fields, which was supposed by some writers to be next\r\nto Tartarus, but by others, to be above the earth on the Isles of the\r\nBlest in the western ocean. The gates to Pluto's regions were guarded by\r\na fiendish dog with three heads but there were supposed to be a number\r\nof pathways which led to the upper world for strange vapors drifted out\r\nof an unexplored cave in southern Italy and both Hercules and Orpheus\r\nwent down through caves in Greece to\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Pluto, the grisly god, who never spares,\r\n    Who feels no mercy, who hears no prayers.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Homer._\r\n\r\n\r\nHercules went down as one of his Twelve Labors,--some of which have\r\nconstellations named after them,--while Orpheus descended to find his\r\nEurydice, playing so beautifully on his harp that this little instrument\r\nwas afterwards placed among the stars and called the constellation Lyra.\r\n\r\nPluto rarely appeared above the ground but when he did he made\r\nhimself invisible by wearing his Hat of Darkness or was drawn in a sooty\r\nchariot by fierce black horses whose reins were covered with rust. One\r\nday when Typhon was causing trouble around Mount Etna by his incessant\r\ngrumbling and turning about, Pluto came up to ascertain just how much\r\nhis roof under the Sicilian land was endangered. This proved a sorry day\r\nfor the earth, for while the gloomy-faced god was looking about for\r\ncracks, Venus saw him from a distant hilltop, and calling Cupid, told\r\nhim to shoot the dour fellow with a gold-tipped arrow, for this was the\r\nonly kingdom over which she had no control. The first person whom Pluto\r\nsaw was Proserpine, the beautiful daughter of Ceres, the tutelary\r\nGoddess of Sicily, and falling immediately in love with her, he carried\r\nher off to his kingdom under the ground. Although for many days\r\nProserpine wept bitterly, she gradually became reconciled, and once ate\r\nsix pomegranate seeds from a tree in Pluto's sunless garden. This proved\r\nher undoing, for when Ceres discovered that Proserpine was Queen of the\r\nKingdom of Shades, she inquired of the Fates if there was any chance of\r\nher daughter's release and they informed her that since Proserpine had\r\ntasted of the seeds, the food of death, she must spend six months of\r\nevery year with Pluto. Thus, through six long months Ceres, the Goddess\r\nof the Harvests, sits and weeps and no fresh crops are planted and no\r\nfruits appear on trees or vines; in the meantime poor mortals do the\r\nbest they can throughout the winter and wait eagerly for the springtime\r\nwhen Proserpine again appears above the land and Ceres, in happiness,\r\nsows the grain and covers the orchards with masses of blossoms.\r\n\r\nApollo, a son of Jupiter, was dazzling and life-giving--a direct\r\ncontrast to Pluto, dark-visaged King of the Dead. Apollo's sun-palace,\r\nwhich had been built by Vulcan in the country beyond the east, was\r\ncrusted thick with gold and embedded with large and wonderful jewels.\r\nHis sun-chariot was also of gold, but of so great a radiance that\r\nit blinded the eyes of any one but the gods. Every morning Apollo put\r\nthe sun in this chariot and drove to the eastern gates where Aurora,\r\nGoddess of the Dawn, flung down the bars for her Sun-god, who penned up\r\nthe stars, collected his Hours about him and drove out along the pathway\r\nof the Heaven with the brilliant light of the sun.\r\n\r\nPhæthon, an ambitious son of Apollo, watched his father day after day,\r\nand wished that he, too, might ride in such radiant splendor above the\r\nclouds. At last he made his way to the sun-palace and begged his father\r\nthat he might show his comrades in Greece that he was truly the child of\r\nso glorious a god by being privileged to drive the sun. Apollo was\r\nhorrified, but Phæthon persisted and at last he gave his reluctant\r\nconsent. The headstrong youth then jumped into the chariot, grasped the\r\nreins of the celestial steeds and started along the zodiac. Ancient\r\npoets assert that the Earth looked up and trembled as she watched the\r\nsnow-white horses of the Sun-god tear wildly up the steep slope in the\r\neast. The constellations shook with terror as they swerved from the\r\nbeaten pathway, the Serpent twined about the icy Pole grew warm and\r\nbegan to writhe, and the Bear's stars fluttered and \"wished to dip in\r\nthe forbidden sea.\" Half dead with fear, Phæthon saw the shadowy\r\nstar-decked forms of wild beasts scattered about the heavens and\r\nshuddered as the fierce Scorpion moved his claws and brandished his\r\nsting. Now beyond all control, the horses veered aside from the \"heat\r\nvex't creatures\" and rushed straight toward the earth, but, just in\r\ntime, Jupiter hurled a tremendous thunderbolt and knocked Phæthon out\r\nof his chariot into a nearby river. The horses now turned toward the\r\nhorizon which rested beyond the waters in the west, but the burning\r\nsun-ball had been drawn so close to the earth that the Nile had fled in\r\nfright and hid its head, which still remains hidden, and over a great\r\narea now known as the African desert, the moisture had risen like a\r\ncloud of steam leaving a drear, unfertile waste of land good for naught.\r\nThe poor African people fared even worse, for while gazing bewildered at\r\nthe wild antics of the sun, their faces were scorched and their bodies\r\nwere scorched and they transmitted forever after to all succeeding\r\ngenerations the scourge of being hopelessly black! As a memorial of this\r\nfamous adventure, the name of the river Eridanus, into which Phæthon\r\nhad fallen, was given to one of the star groups in the sky. This was\r\nalso supposed to be a consolation to Apollo, who grieved so deeply at\r\nthe death of his son and all the unfortunate consequences of his\r\nadventure that he offered to allow any other god on Olympus the\r\nprivilege of driving the sun on its daily course from east to west, but\r\nno other god could do this, nor were any willing to try.\r\n\r\nApollo had a twin sister named Diana who owned a chariot as wonderful as\r\nhis own, only it was wrought of pure silver and made to carry the\r\nearth's night light, called the moon. But Diana did not spend all of her\r\ntime in the sky, for she loved to hunt and would often leave her chariot\r\nat home, take out her bow and arrow and spend whole nights upon the\r\nmountains with her nymphs. She was wondrously fair and full of grace but\r\nnot as faithful as her brother, and at such times as she chooses to\r\nenjoy herself, earth-beings must do without a moon.\r\n\r\nBesides the gods and the goddesses who dwelt in ancient Greece, there\r\nwere many heroes who were semi-divine. One recalls Perseus, Hercules,\r\nthe twins Castor and Pollux and others. Perseus was a son of Jupiter and\r\na very noted hero. One of his adventures was so thrilling that the early\r\npeople of this little country impressed its story on six constellations!\r\n\r\nHercules, the hero famed for his wonderful strength, patience and\r\nendurance, was a grandson of Perseus. He was also rewarded with a\r\nconstellation. So was Orion, the giant, who has the most conspicuous\r\nfigure of stars in all the sky. The twins, Castor and Pollux, were\r\ngiven twin stars and were much beloved by seamen for it was thought that\r\nif both stars were visible, fine weather was sure to follow.\r\n\r\nNot only were gods and heroes placed in the sky, but also objects and\r\ncreatures connected with their adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"monstrous shadows of prodigious size,\r\n    That deck'd with stars, lie scatter'd o'er the skies.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Ovid's Metamorphoses._\r\n                                 (ADDISON'S _Trans._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we find among the constellations Draco, the Dragon; Cygnus,\r\nthe Swan; Ursa Major, the Great Bear; Ursa Minor, the Little Bear;\r\n\r\n[Figure 06: The Constellation of Cygnus, the Swan.]\r\n\r\nLyra, the Harp; Pegasus, the Flying Horse; Cancer, the Crab; Delphinus,\r\nthe Dolphin; Pisces, the Fishes; Sagitta, the Arrow; Argo, the Ship;\r\nCorona, the Crown; Leo, the Lion; Scorpius, the Scorpion; Hydra, the\r\nWatersnake; Aries, the Ram; Taurus, the Bull; Eridanus, the River, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nMapmakers later drew fanciful pictures of these objects and animals and\r\nheroes which had been transposed to the sky and united them up with the\r\npositions of the stars. This imaginative tapestry of figures is believed\r\nto be an attempt on the part of the ancient people to weave a record of\r\ntheir history in the dusk among the stars. That this most original\r\nmethod was successful is attested by the fact that although several\r\nthousand years have elapsed these ancient figures still stand and the\r\nnames that they gave to the constellations are used by astronomers\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nMany of the Grecian characters which are mentioned in the stories of the\r\ngods and heroes are personified in groups of three--the three Fates,\r\ndaughters of Chaos, appointed to watch over the thread of human life--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Spin, Spin, Clotho spin!\r\n    Lachesis twist!\r\n    Atropos sever!\"\r\n\r\n              --_Lowell._\r\n\r\n\r\nthe three Furies, daughters of Night, who represent the remorse which\r\ntorments and pursues the wicked; the three Sirens, who lived on an\r\nenchanted Isle in the Mediterranean Sea and lured mariners on the rocks\r\nwith their bewitching songs; the three Graces, who presided over feast\r\nand dance; the nine Muses, daughters of Jupiter, who dwelt on Mount\r\nHelicon and presided over arts and sciences--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fortunate is he whomsoever the Muses love, and sweet blows his voice\r\nfrom his lips.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMount Helicon was also the home of the great Flying Horse which is\r\nsought by poets and is now represented in the sky by a large square of\r\nstars called the Square of Pegasus. In one of the adventures of the hero\r\nPerseus he snatched the solitary eye away from the three Grey Sisters\r\nand thus forced them to tell where he might find the three terrible\r\nGorgons. Transcribed to stars, he still holds the snaky ringlets of the\r\nGorgon Medusa which he had been forced to obtain at the command of the\r\nking of the Island of Seriphus. This head now has the added attraction\r\nof a mysterious star called Algol, which every few days indulges in a\r\nslow, deliberate \"wink,\" a performance most unusual among the wide-eyed\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nThe names of the gods and goddesses were bestowed upon the five planets\r\nthen known--Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury. This plan was also\r\nfollowed when the two outer planets, Uranus and Neptune, were discovered\r\nin modern days. These names are Roman names but the mythology of the\r\nGreeks and Romans is so intermingled that the names of their characters\r\nare, as a general rule, used interchangeably, although the Roman names\r\nseem more popular and are used by astronomers. Many writers of mythology\r\nuse the Grecian names entirely because much of the material of the Roman\r\nlegends was brought into their literature by Greek poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Roman_                           _Greek_\r\n\r\n    Jupiter                             Zeus\r\n    Juno                                Hera\r\n    Neptune                         Poseidon\r\n    Ceres                            Demeter\r\n    Diana                            Artemis\r\n    Vulcan                        Hephaestus\r\n    Minerva                    Pallas Athene\r\n    Mars                                Ares\r\n    Venus                          Aphrodite\r\n    Mercury                           Hermes\r\n    Apollo                            Apollo\r\n    Vesta                             Hestia\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symbols of the gods were used as signs for their planets. These\r\nsigns are very familiar objects in almanacs. Thus, Uranus (Heaven) and\r\nEarth are respectively represented by ♅ and ♁; Saturn, their son,\r\nhas a sign which suggests his ancient scythe ♄; Jupiter has a\r\nhieroglyph for the eagle ♃, a bird which carried his\r\nthunderbolts; his brother Neptune is pictured with a trident ♆, the\r\npronged fork he used when issuing commands; Mercury, son of Jupiter, is\r\nrepresented by his Caduceus, a miraculous staff intertwined with\r\nserpents ☿; Mars, God of War and also a son of Jupiter, a\r\nconventionalized arrangement of his shield and spear ♂; while Venus,\r\nGoddess of Love and born from the foam of the sea, has a sign somewhat\r\nlike Mercury's ♀, resembling a hand mirror.\r\n\r\nA word as to Mars, Mercury and Venus might not be amiss. Mars was\r\nworshiped as a warrior in splendid armor, his name being quite\r\nappropriate for the red tinged planet which shines as such a brilliant,\r\nfiery star. Discord was visioned as running before him in tattered\r\ngarments while Anger and Clamor follow in his train. Deimos and Phobos,\r\nchildren of Venus and Mars, were given as names to the two satellites of\r\nhis planet, although these satellites (or moons), were not discovered\r\nuntil modern times. (The ten satellites of Saturn were named after his\r\nbrothers and sisters, while those of Jupiter, who possessed nine, were\r\nnamed after various favorites.)\r\n\r\nMercury, also a son of Jupiter, was a somewhat mischievous but charming\r\nyoung man with wings fixed to his helmet and sandals, and his hand held\r\na rod which quieted all disputes. He was messenger, herald and\r\nambassador for Jupiter, just as Iris, who flew along the rainbow in her\r\ntinted robes, was a messenger for Juno, Jupiter's wife. It was\r\nafterwards discovered by astronomers that the tiny orb which had been\r\ngiven the name of Mercury in honor of this god, not only resembled a\r\ndrop of \"quick-silver\" but also possessed the \"wing-shoe\" characteristic\r\nof its namesake, for it speeds at the rate of more miles per second than\r\nany other planet in the solar system.\r\n\r\nVenus, the beautiful Goddess of Love, has been the inspiration for\r\npainters, poets and sculptors in every corner of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"But light as any wind that blows,\r\n    So fleetly did she stir,\r\n    The flower she touched on dipt and rose,\r\n    And turned to look at her.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous statues extant is the Venus de' Medici preserved\r\nin the Uffizi Gallery at Florence. This statue, which was dug up in\r\nseveral fragments during the 17th century, is the work of Cleomenes,\r\nan Athenian who \"flourished\" in 150 B. C.\r\n\r\nVenus was called Aphrodite by the Greeks, from _aphros_, meaning foam.\r\nSome poets have told how the foam itself suddenly turned iridescent,\r\ntrembled, and from its center rose the lovely Venus. Others tell how a\r\nclosed shell tinted like a rose floated to the top of a billow where it\r\nopened and disclosed the pearly daintiness of the goddess. The god\r\nZephyrus, the west wind, then wafted her to the shores of Cyprus where\r\nshe was adorned by the Hours and later carried to the home of the gods\r\non Mount Olympus where the most beautiful star in the sky, the planet\r\nVenus, was named after her.\r\n\r\nOwing to the slanting motion of the stars when in the east or west, the\r\nfigures of these star groups show marked changes. The \"Great Square,\"\r\nfor instance, stands on a corner star when seen in the east and west\r\nalthough it is a perfect square when seen in the south, while the\r\n\"Twins\" appear above the eastern horizon standing on their heads, slowly\r\nright themselves as they travel across the sky and sink feet first when\r\nthey disappear below the horizon in the west.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate more clearly one might imagine the \"Giant Orion\" to be a\r\ntiny toy fastened by his waist to a wire bent in the shape of an arc.\r\n[Figure 07]\r\nAs he slides from east to west it is easy to see how his position\r\nchanges in relation to an eye directly in front of him. This varying\r\norientation is easily understood and should give the reader but\r\nlittle trouble.\r\n\r\nOften a part of a constellation, such as the Big Dipper, is more\r\nfamiliar to the majority of people than the whole constellation, which\r\nis called \"Ursa Major\" or the \"Great Bear,\"--the handle of the Dipper is\r\nonly the tail of the Bear.\r\n\r\n[Figure 08: \"Constellations come and climb the heavens and\r\ngo.\"--_Bryant_.]\r\n\r\nIn all cases these prominent features will be used as index names.\r\n\r\nRomance is said to gain when tinctured with realism just as realism\r\ngains when tinctured with romance. So, with a heart filled with beauty\r\nand a mind filled with facts, let us go forth on starry nights and seek,\r\nwith eyes that are friendly, our acquaintances among the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 09: THE TWO DIPPERS AND DRACO, THE DRAGON.\r\nThese stars circle about Polaris, the North Star, and are visible\r\nat any hour during the night throughout the year.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TWO SKY DIPPERS AND DRACO, THE DRAGON\r\n\r\nTHE BIG DIPPER\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nA BROKEN handled duplicate of the old fashioned tin dipper that used to\r\nhang by the well, lies twinkling in the northern half of the sky. This\r\nDipper is ornamented with seven bright stars although a telescope or a\r\nfield-glass will disclose dozens more encrusted on its handle and a\r\nstarry phosphorescence in its bowl.\r\n\r\n[Figure 10]\r\nThis Dipper may be found near the zenith, almost overhead, during the\r\nearly evening hours in April and May; it is west of the North Star in\r\nJuly and August, near the northern horizon in October and November and\r\nin the east during January and February.\r\n\r\nAlthough every twenty-four hours this Sky Dipper swings completely\r\naround the North Star, half of the journey is invisible because the\r\nstrong light of the sun prevents us from seeing the stars in the\r\ndaytime.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The fiery sun, when wheeling up heaven's height,\r\n    Obscures the stars and the moon's holy light.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Leonidas_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stars, however, rise two hours earlier every month and this brings\r\nthe Dipper, when observed during the early hours of darkness, to\r\ndifferent positions in the sky during the different seasons.\r\n\r\nSince this conspicuous star figure travels completely around the arctic\r\ncircle of the heavens in twenty-four hours, the space within this circle\r\nhas been likened to a great star clock, the two outer stars on the\r\nbowl--called \"The Pointers\"--forming the hour hand which always points\r\ntoward the center of the clock marked by the North Star. With a little\r\nattention anyone may learn to judge the time by this timepiece and wager\r\nas much on it as the Carrier in Shakespeare's King Henry IV who looks up\r\nas he enters the Inn Yard with his lantern and remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Heigh-ho! An't be not four by the day, I'll be hanged, Charles' Wain is\r\nover the new chimney, and yet our horse is not packed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Big Dipper is called \"Charles' Wain\" in England, the bowl being the\r\nwagon or wain, and the stars on the handle, the horses. It is also\r\ncalled \"David's chariot\" and the \"Plowshare.\" In Rome these seven bright\r\nstars were called \"Septentriones\" or \"The Seven Plowing Oxen\"; in\r\nGreece, simply the \"Triones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Twas the time when all things are silent, and Boötes had turned his\r\nwain with the pole obliquely directed among the Triones.\"\r\n\r\n                            --_Ovid's Metamorphoses_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoötes, so the story runs, being of an ingenious turn of mind, tilled\r\nhis land in fine order by inventing the plow which he hitched to two\r\noxen.\r\n[Figure 11]\r\nFor this he was given the title of the \"Herdsman\" or the \"Ox-driver\" and\r\nplaced in the heavens to follow the stars of the Big Dipper which\r\nresembles a \"wain\" or a plow. Boötes' constellation, though very large,\r\nis formed of faint stars,--with the exception of one brilliant\r\ngolden-yellow star which may be located by drawing a curve from the end\r\nof the Big Dipper's handle.\r\n\r\nThe little star just above the star in the crook of the handle of the\r\nDipper is sometimes spoken of as a 'rider.' The Arabs call these two\r\nstars a \"Horse and its Rider,\" the English call the rider\r\n\"Jack-on-the-Middle-Horse,\" while the Germans call him\r\n\"Hans-on-the-Middle Horse.\" Hans chose this position in preference to\r\nany other on the face of the earth or in the kingdom of Heaven.\r\n\r\nAstronomers have still another name for the Horse and its Rider. To them\r\nit is a \"naked-eye double,\" the tiny star being called \"Alcor,\" and the\r\none on the Dipper's handle just below it, \"Mizar.\" A 3-inch telescope\r\ndiscloses a still closer companion to Mizar which has a decided greenish\r\ntinge in its light. Of the two stars composing Mizar, each one is itself\r\ncomposed of two, which revolve around a common center of gravity in a\r\nperiod to be counted in thousands of years. This wonderful law of\r\ngravitation which holds not only planets in their orbits, but also\r\nstars, was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton, an English philosopher and\r\nmathematician. Two stars revolving around a common center of gravity in\r\nthis manner are called a \"binary\"; in the case of Mizar and its\r\ncompanion, each of the two visual components is called a \"spectroscopic\r\nbinary.\" The brighter component was discovered to be a binary in 1889 by\r\nE. C. Pickering with the aid of a spectroscope and the fainter component\r\nwas found to be a spectroscopic binary in 1908 by Frost and Lee. Alcor\r\nis also a spectroscopic binary.\r\n\r\nThe stars are such an exceedingly great distance from the earth that\r\neven though they are in constant motion, they do not seem to change\r\ntheir relations to other stars through long periods of time. The whole\r\nconfiguration of the Big Dipper will some day be changed because its\r\nstars are traveling in various directions. Through the skill of various\r\nscientists this infinitesimal difference in motion is detected and\r\nrecorded,--not only that a star is moving, but which way and how fast!\r\nThus the spectroscope exploded the old idea that the stars were\r\n\"fixed.\" The facts, however, are amazing and one must immediately\r\nreadjust his ideas of what constitutes big and little, fast and slow,\r\nfor in studying astronomy the small distances on our earth and the vast\r\ndistances in space, and man-made speed and God-made speed, can hardly\r\neven be compared.\r\n\r\n[Figure 12]\r\nThe stars of the Big Dipper are an exceptional group for they are all\r\nbright stars of the second magnitude, with the exception of Megrez at\r\nthe junction of the handle to the bowl. These seven stars, and the\r\n\"Rider,\" were given names by the Arabian astronomers, and although\r\nmodern astronomers prefer for the most part a Greek letter prefixed to\r\nthe genitive case of the Latin name of the constellation--such as β\r\nUrsae Majoris--these names are rather interesting to know. Starting from\r\nthe top of the Big Dipper's handle, the Arabian names are as follows:\r\nBenetnasch, Mizar, Alioth, Megrez, Phaed, Merak, and Dubhe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE DIPPER\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Little Dipper\" hangs on the Pole of the Heavens, swinging swiftly\r\naround night after night, century after century.\r\n[Figure 13]\r\nIt hangs stiffly, as a dipper should, from the bright golden nail of the\r\nNorth Star. From its appearance, it would seem that the rapid motion\r\nnear the pivot of the starry dome had caused its handle to bend forward\r\nat a most precarious angle--surely nothing less than the immortality\r\nconferred upon it as a part of Ursa Minor could prevent it from flinging\r\nits bowl through the depths of space and whirling henceforth an\r\nuninteresting stub of a handle.\r\n\r\nThe Little Dipper is rather faintly outlined, the only bright stars\r\nbeing those which mark the extremities. The two more conspicuous stars\r\nwere named \"The Guards\" for it was thought that they protected the \"hole\r\nin which the axle of the earth is borne.\" This \"hole,\" which was\r\nimagined as keeping in place the north pole of the heavens, is marked by\r\nthe North Star.\r\n[Figure 14]\r\nTo be exact, the North Star does not mark its precise location but is\r\nabout twice the diameter of the moon away from it. Such a small\r\ndistance, however, is scarcely discernible to the eye.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, all the stars travel in unchanged order along their\r\narcs from east to west except this one star which marks the north pole\r\nof the heavens. There is no star directly above the pole of the southern\r\nhemisphere of our earth. The North Star, or \"Polaris,\" is therefore the\r\nonly star which remains in an apparently fixed position in the sky, and\r\nall the other stars visible to us whirl around it as a center, although\r\nin most cases only a portion of their arcs may be seen. If the earth\r\nshould falter or halt in its rotation, so would the whirl of the stars,\r\nand this remarkable exhibition, which is only a delusion dependent on\r\nthe motion of the earth, would immediately cease to be.\r\n\r\nPolaris has a minute blue companion star which may be viewed in a 2- or\r\n3-inch telescope.\r\n\r\nThe most reliable method of establishing a true meridian in surveying is\r\nto take observations on Polaris. \"Amid the blue ice and rose-petal night\r\nof the pole\" this star is, of course, in the very dome of the sky, and\r\nAdmiral Peary once had the unique distinction of having it shine\r\ndirectly over his head. But in any other location, this star burns like\r\nthe light of a signal fire marking the north, and its steady,\r\nnever-failing presence has always heartened and given a feeling of\r\nsecurity to travelers, as well as being useful to surveyors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO BEARS AND THEIR STORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two sky Dippers are only the flanks and the tails of the whole\r\nconstellations which are called the \"Great Bear\" and the \"Little\r\nBear.\" Their names are usually written in Latin--\"Ursa Major\" and\r\n\"Ursa Minor.\"\r\n\r\nThe tail of the Great Bear, outlined by the bright stars of the Big\r\nDipper's handle, is the most clearly marked portion of his anatomy. So\r\ninordinately proud is he of this huge appendage, (which is also, the\r\nmost clearly marked figure in the sky), that, so old legends assert, he\r\ngazes jealously at the lone bright star on the end of the Little Bear's\r\ntail in hopes that some day he may gain possession of it and add it to\r\nhis own. This is another reason why the \"Guards\" have been placed to\r\nwatch the North Star.\r\n\r\nThe feet of this Bear extend to three pairs of stars set nearly\r\nequidistant, although there are no stars for one of his forefeet.\r\n[Figure 15]\r\nThe Arabs call these the \"Doe's Leaps.\" The Bear's head is sprinkled\r\nwith a scattered group of faint stars on a line with the bowl of the\r\nDipper.\r\n\r\nThis interesting creature is most impressive when in the springtime\r\nhis shadowy, star-decked form crosses the sky near the zenith. He seems\r\nclosest then and we cramp back our necks to get a better view of this\r\nancient Bear about whom is twined so many legends.\r\n\r\n[Figure 16:\r\n\r\n   \"The Bear that prowled all night about the fold\r\n    Of the North Star.\"\r\n\r\n--_Lowell._]\r\n\r\nLater, during the autumn months, he walks along the rim of the horizon\r\nin the north, but there too often, sad to relate, he is more than half\r\nobscured by the mists and fogs which hover about near the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to account for the ridiculous length of the\r\nbrightly-jeweled tails of the star-bears. Richard A. Proctor in \"Easy\r\nStar Lessons\" suggests that as the star maps were arranged by\r\nastronomers who being aware of the many legends but who had themselves\r\nnever seen a bear, naturally supposed the three bright stars in the\r\nhandle of the Big Dipper to be Ursa Major's tail and so drew it. Since\r\nthe Big Dipper was made part of Ursa Major or the Great Bear, the Little\r\nDipper, whose seven principal stars resemble those of Ursa Major, was\r\nmade part of Ursa Minor, the Little Bear.\r\n\r\nHowe remarks in his \"Descriptive Astronomy\" that the \"length of the\r\nlittle fellow's tail might be ascribed to environment.\"\r\n[Figure 17]\r\n'Tis reasonable indeed. With the tip of it fastened to the North Star\r\nfor a pivot it might stretch after being swung round for a few\r\ncenturies. Perhaps, to go still further, this is the reason it is now so\r\nthin and therefore faint, and also why it is broken. The quaint theory\r\nof Dr. Thomas Hood, who wrote early in the 17th century, is also quoted\r\nas a possible reason for the length of the Great Bear's tail:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Imagine that Jupiter, fearing to come nigh unto her teeth layde hold on\r\nher tayle, and thereby drew her up into heaven, so shee of herself,\r\nbeing very weightie, and the distance from the earth to the heavens very\r\ngreat, there was great likelihood that her tayle must stretch.\r\n\r\n\"Other reason know I none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsa Major was not a real bear, however, but a beautiful and most\r\nunfortunate Arcadian nymph, named Callisto, who had been transformed by\r\nJuno, Queen of the Immortals, into this great shaggy creature. Years\r\nafterward, Callisto's son Arcas, then a boy half-grown, met the bear on\r\na lonely pathway on the mountains and shot an arrow at the creature.\r\nHappily, as was often the way with the gods, Jupiter looked down\r\njust then, stopped the arrow in its flight and changed the young boy\r\nalso into a bear. The bears were then raised to the sky and placed among\r\nthe stars, for Jupiter straightway:\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \"Snatched them through the air\r\n    In whirlwinds up to heaven and fixed them there.\"\r\n\r\n                   --_Ovid's Metamorphoses_. (ADDISON'S _Trans_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place is even yet easily located on account of the clearly marked\r\noutlines of the Dippers.\r\n\r\nThis sympathy on the part of Jupiter aroused Juno to such a jealous rage\r\nthat she immediately sought a way to bring discomfort to the Bears,\r\nparticularly to the Bear which was Callisto. It seems that the Greeks\r\nbelieved that the stars enjoyed a dip in the western waves of the ocean\r\nbefore disappearing to the darkness below the horizon, and seeing in\r\nthis a chance for revenge, Juno harnessed up her peacocks and drove to\r\nthe palace of Oceanus, the ancient God of the Ocean Stream. Here the\r\ngoddess found the Ocean God (who was one of the Titans and ruled before\r\nNeptune's time), and calling him up from the briny depths inveigled that\r\ndeity to swear by the river Styx that he would drive the \"seven Triones\"\r\naway from his \"azure waters\" every time these stars appeared and never,\r\nunder any circumstances, would he share his hospitality with the Bears.\r\nAfter the long journey from the east across the dimly lighted heavens,\r\nthis was a hardship difficult to endure, yet to this day, since a god's\r\ndecree may never be changed, the two Bears turn as they approach the\r\nocean and dare not even linger to sniff the spray. While all the other\r\nconstellations immerse their stars beneath the waves, these poor\r\ncreatures again ascend the steep slope of the sky and repeat the big\r\ncircle about the pole of the heavens with never a rest--nor a bath.\r\n\r\nBut travelers have quietly observed these stars in a latitude south of\r\n40 degrees, and have noticed, as they approached the equator, that\r\nthe Bears slip their feet into the sea and still farther south\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"despite of Juno, lave\r\n    Their tardy bodies in the boreal wave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAllen, in \"Star Names and Their Meanings,\" comments on the singularity\r\nthat peoples separated by an impassable ocean had like ideas concerning\r\nthe resemblance of Ursa Major to a bear.\r\n\r\n[Figure 18]\r\n\r\n\"Whence came the same idea into the minds of our North American Indians?\r\nWas it by accident? The conformation in no way resembles the\r\nanimal,--indeed the contrary; yet they called them Okuari and Paukunawa,\r\nwords for bear, long before they were visited by white men. In justice,\r\nhowever, to their familiarity with a bear's anatomy, it should be said\r\nthat the impossible tail of our Ursa was to them either Three Hunters or\r\na Hunter and two dogs in pursuit of the creature, the star Alcor being\r\nthe pot in which to cook her. They thus avoided the incongruousness of\r\nthe present astronomical ideas of Bruin's makeup, although their cooking\r\nutensil was inadequate.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to this legend, which is related from a monograph on \"The\r\nCelestial Bear\" by Stansbury Hagar, the whole bear is represented by the\r\nstars of the Big Dipper. The first hunter, who is the first star in the\r\nhandle of the Dipper, was called the robin and carried the bow with\r\nwhich to kill the bear. The chicadee, the second star in the handle of\r\nthe Dipper, carried the pot, the little star Alcor, in which to cook the\r\nbear. The third hunter, the moosebird, carried the sticks with which to\r\nbuild the fire. Four other hunters followed besides the three\r\nrepresented by the stars in the Dipper's handle.\r\n\r\nThe chase continues throughout the summer until part of the hunters\r\ndisappear below the horizon. About mid-autumn the Bear rises up to\r\ndefend herself but is pierced by an arrow of the robin, and the autumn\r\nleaves are stained scarlet from his wounds. The spirit of the dead Bear\r\nenters into another Bear and the chase begins again and so keeps up\r\neternally. In the Indian version the group of stars above the hunters\r\n(which is the Bear's head in the Ursa Major of the Greeks), is the\r\nBear's den. This den is picturesquely situated on the northern horizon\r\nearly in the spring and, to the mind of the Indian, the great Bear seems\r\nas if it were just emerging after a long winter's hibernation.\r\n\r\nThere is also an old Iroquois Indian tale which claims that at one time\r\nin the distant past the bear had a fine bushy tail but that this tail\r\nwas frozen off one cold winter when the foolish animal endeavored to\r\ncatch a fish by letting the long appendage hang through a hole in the\r\nice. In those days, perhaps, the bears were vain creatures,--which might\r\nexplain, in part, why the star-jeweled tails on the shadowy forms of\r\nUrsa Major and Ursa Minor are held with the upright pride of a cat with\r\nnine kittens as these mammoth plantigrades nightly promenade on their\r\ncircular path around the Pole.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRACO, THE DRAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nA sinuous line of stars divides the figures of the Great and Little\r\nBears. These stars lie on the huge body of Draco, the Sky Dragon, whose\r\nlength coils halfway around the axis of the world.\r\n\r\n[Figure 19]\r\nDraco is sometimes called the \"Guardian of the Stars,\" the stars being\r\nthe golden apples which hang from the pole-tree in the Garden of\r\nDarkness. This is rather a pretty conceit as the Dragon's Eyes,\r\nrepresented by the stars Alwaid and Etanin, never rest, that is, never\r\nset below the northern horizon of Greece.\r\n\r\nThe above title was probably suggested by the legend which tells of\r\nLaden, the sleepless dragon, that guarded the tree of golden fruit in\r\nthe Garden of the Hesperides. This garden lay near the feet of Atlas,\r\nthe giant Titan, who sat on a mountain in northern Africa supporting the\r\ndome of the heavens. The bright eyes of this snake were at that time\r\naided in their wakefulness by the silvery, lilting voices of the\r\nHesperides, daughters of Hesperus, whose name was given to the beautiful\r\nEvening Star so often seen in this direction. According to one legend,\r\nHercules slew this dragon in order to pick the gleaming fruit and bring\r\nit to his cousin Eurystheus as his eleventh Labor, but that this Dragon\r\ncould be identical with the sky dragon, Draco, whose head lies just\r\nbeyond the heel of Hercules, is somewhat discounted by other legends\r\nwhich claim that Hercules temporarily supported the weight of heaven\r\nwhile Atlas went down to the garden and got the apples from his nieces.\r\nIn return for this favor, Atlas gained a little rest.\r\n\r\nIt has also been suggested that perhaps Draco was the monster \"with a\r\nbody more huge than any mountain pine\" and \"a roar like a fire\r\namong the woodlands,\" which was entwined around a beech tree in the\r\nGrove of Mars, the War-god, at the eastern end of the Euxine (which we\r\nnow call the Black Sea). On this beech tree was nailed the golden fleece\r\nof the wondrous ram which flew into the sky and aided two persecuted\r\nchildren to escape. To obtain this fleece, Orpheus drugged the snake\r\nwith music while Jason stepped across the mighty coils and tore the\r\ngolden wool from the tree. After the Argonautic expedition, both the ram\r\nand the dragon were placed among the stars.\r\n\r\nStill another legend relates that when the gods and the earth-born\r\ngiants waged their mighty war to gain possession of Olympus, a huge\r\ncrawling monster had the audacity to anger the Goddess Minerva who\r\nseized it and hurled it far into the heavens where it caught on the axis\r\nof the world, and froze into immobility before it had time to unwind its\r\ncontortions. The only time on record that this dragon ever revived from\r\nits stupid torpor was when Phæthon, son of Apollo, lost control of the\r\nsteeds of his sun-chariot and the heated vehicle swerved northward from\r\nthe beaten path.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Then the folded Serpent next the frozen pole,\r\n    Stiff and benumb'd before, began to roll,\r\n    And rag'd with inward heat, and threatened war.\"\r\n\r\n                   --_Ovid's Metamorphoses_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there are a number of opinions as to just which dragon in\r\nlegend is represented by Draco, the constellation is a very important\r\none, for one of its stars, a star named Thuban, was at one time our Pole\r\nStar. Indeed, in 2300 B. C. the Pharaohs of Egypt looked up at Thuban as\r\ntheir Pole Star. As their _Pole Star_! But where was our faithful North\r\nStar during 2300 B. C., and how could our earth's pole swing from this\r\npoint in the heavens to one half the way between the \"Guards\" on the\r\ntiny bowl of the Little Dipper, and Mizar on the crook of the handle of\r\nthe Big Dipper? This strange phenomenon not only happened but\r\nhappens regularly, for the earth \"reels like a top\" as well as \"whirls,\"\r\nalthough the reeling motion is so much slower than the whirling motion\r\nthat while it whirls once on its axis in a day, it reels around only\r\nonce in 25,000 years. During this time the earth's axis describes a\r\ncircle from Thuban, through the present Pole Star, around through Vega\r\nand back again. Vega may be easily located for it crosses the zenith in\r\nthe late evenings of summer, a beautiful bluish-white star of the first\r\nmagnitude. It will be about 11,500 years or about 13,500 A. D. before\r\nthis blue star will again shine above the northern pole of our earth.\r\n\r\nIt was not an uncommon thing in olden times to build temples dedicated\r\nto the observation of certain stars. It is believed that the great\r\npyramid of Cheops, built 4600 years ago, was so constructed that the\r\nlight of Thuban, then the Pole Star, would shine down its great stone\r\ntube at the time the star was at its lower culmination. Olcott in\r\n\"Starlore of All Ages\" tells us that the idea was to conduct the ray of\r\nlight from Thuban through the passage opening high up in the side of the\r\npyramid, to the eye of a god hidden far down beneath its foundations.\r\nWhen viewed from the bottom of the tunnel, which ends in a room hollowed\r\nout of solid stone, it is said that the mouth appears but little larger\r\nthan the moon's diameter. It is interesting to note that the pyramid of\r\nCheops is the mightiest structure the world has ever seen. According to\r\nHerodotus, 100,000 men were employed constantly on this work for 20\r\nyears. But the rays of Thuban can no longer shine down the 380 feet of\r\nstone tube to light the eye of the god hidden in its depths, for the\r\nreeling of the earth has caused the tube to be out of the star's line of\r\nlight. It may happen again in 21,000 years, however—if the pyramid is\r\nstill there.\r\n\r\nIn China there is an observatory 4000 years old which Samuel G. Bayne in\r\nhis little book the \"Pith of Astronomy\" speaks of visiting. Here is\r\na slanting granite wall in which two eyeholes had been bored for the\r\nsole purpose of sighting Thuban.\r\n\r\nChanges in the universe are very gradual and although 4000 years seems a\r\nlong time to the limited mind of a human being, it is but little in\r\ncomparison to the vast periods of time which must pass before a visible\r\nchange can be noticed in the heavens. We speak of these years\r\nnonchalantly, but astronomers have had to work hard and patiently in\r\norder to make such assertions and to back them up with sufficient proof.\r\n\r\nTraveling backward in imagination on the circle that our pole has taken\r\n25,000 years to describe in the sky, and again imagining the star which\r\nwe now see as our Pole Star as the Pole Star of that by-gone era, what a\r\ndifference we find in the appearance of the earth! Herds of strange and\r\nsavage animals are scattered here instead of thriving villages and\r\ncities, and man, in equally savage state, wanders about the hills and\r\nplains alone or in straggling bands.\r\n\r\n[Figure 20]\r\nIn traveling forward 21,000 years again to the time only 4000 years ago\r\nwhen Thuban, on the coils of the Dragon, shone as our Pole Star, we come\r\nto comparatively recent times; civilization on our earth has made great\r\nadvances, not the least of them being that it has raised its head and\r\nhas noted that there are not only stars but that the stars differ from\r\none another. Probably during this era the Chinese chose the Dragon for\r\ntheir national emblem.\r\n\r\nThe principal interest in the constellation of Draco is, of course, the\r\nstar Thuban. It is interesting to locate this ancient Pole Star\r\nwhich lies on the tail of Draco, just above the handle of the Big\r\nDipper, and reflect that this star was once the hub of the starry\r\nuniverse, with the Big Dipper whirling round and round it in a close\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 21: A SUMMER DRAMA.\r\nThe Stars of this ancient Royal Family shine conspicuously in the\r\nNortheast during the late summer evenings.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF ANDROMEDA IN STARS\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Characters_\r\n\r\n    CEPHEUS, _the King_.          ANDROMEDA, _the Princess_.\r\n\r\n    CASSIOPEIA, _the Queen_.      PEGASUS, _the Flying Horse_.\r\n\r\n    PERSEUS, _the Hero_.          CETUS, _the Sea-monster_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIKE the shadow of a dream among the summer stars of the northern sky is\r\na wonderful story of romance and adventure. This story has been\r\nmentioned in all Greek literature of the 5th century before Christ, in\r\nincidents portrayed on early vases and in wall-paintings found in\r\nPompeii, and its characters have been immortalized on brilliant groups\r\nof stars.\r\n\r\nThe tale that I am about to recount has lived since the time when great\r\nfabled sea-monsters were wont to appear and frighten the people along\r\nthe coasts of the Mediterranean. Wild with terror, the king and his\r\nsubjects would fly to the temples for protection and would even\r\nsacrifice their loved ones if an oracle so decreed.\r\n\r\nIn an age long past, scientists tell us, strange beasts actually\r\ninhabited the waters of the ocean. This they know for they have found\r\nthe fossilized skeletons. For the sake of the romance let us imagine\r\nthat some of these still survived in Andromeda's time; that one such\r\nmonster had wandered in through the straits to the blue waters of the\r\nMediterranean during the reign of her father King Cepheus, and that this\r\nking, following the advice of an oracle, actually chained his daughter\r\nto a rock upon the sea-shore believing that by this supreme\r\nsacrifice the wrath of Neptune might be appeased. Storms, wrecks and\r\nother disasters relating to the sea were thought to be the handiwork of\r\nthe Sea-god seeking revenge for some fancied insult. Seeing the strange\r\nsea-beast appear along their coast, the Ethiopians probably considered\r\nall their sins and decided the cause was the excessive vanity of their\r\nQueen. Thus, from a bare thread, a beautiful story was elaborated and\r\nwoven about Andromeda, the Princess; Perseus, the Hero; Cassiopeia, the\r\nQueen; Cepheus, the King; and Cetus, the terrible Sea-monster.\r\n\r\nNot only was Cassiopeia proud and beautiful, but she wished others to be\r\nenvious of her beauty, and to prove her superiority sent challengers\r\nthroughout the country so that none might question it. In the excess of\r\nher vanity, she deliberately took her throne and sat in state by the\r\nshore, loudly repeating her boasts to show that she did not fear even\r\nthe peerless sea-nymphs.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this audacious performance reached the ears of the\r\nNereids who inhabited the depths of the Mediterranean, there was great\r\nexcitement, but particularly was it resented by the sea-beauty Atergatis\r\nwho straightway swam to the palace of Neptune, under the Ægean Sea, and\r\nbegged him to avenge the insult offered to his nymphs. Neptune, furious\r\nat the effrontery of the Ethiopian Queen, shook the land of King Cepheus\r\nuntil the hills cracked and sent his waves to flood the country and wash\r\naway the coast. With the onrushing waters came the ferocious sea-monster\r\nwhich loitered near the shores and the mouths of the rivers and\r\ndestroyed every man and animal that came within its reach.\r\n\r\nTerrified by such a combination of calamities, Cepheus and Cassiopeia\r\nfled to the oracle of Jupiter, but they found no peace here, for the\r\noracle informed them that the only way to make amends and ward off the\r\nevil that had befallen them, lay in the sacrifice of their innocent\r\ndaughter Andromeda. There being no alternative, Cepheus was\r\ncompelled by his subjects to submit to these terms, and taking poor\r\nAndromeda to the sea-beach, chained her wrists and ankles and fastened\r\nthem to staples driven in a rock upon the shore. In the meantime the\r\npopulation of the entire city had gathered weeping upon a cliff, while\r\nin the distance Neptune's monster, sensing the commotion, swam steadily\r\nnearer, with his wicked, gloating eyes staring fixedly on the dainty\r\nmorsel baited on the rocks.\r\n\r\nAndromeda, in utter despair, bowed her head,--then looked up quickly on\r\nhearing the cheers of the people, for the hero Perseus had appeared,\r\nbounding and skimming along the sky and slanting downward toward the\r\nfoaming waves. The hero gave one glance at the awful monster, then drew\r\nhis sword and drove it deep into the sea-beast's scaly neck. With his\r\nother hand he pulled the Medusa's head from his wallet,--and the\r\nsea-beast slowly hardened into a beast of stone. With its glassy eyes\r\nprotruding like balls of obsidian, the creature then sank in a petrified\r\nmass to the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe heroic youth, amazed at the effectiveness of the terrifying head,\r\nflew quickly to Andromeda and struck away the fetters which bound her to\r\nthe shore. The King and his subjects then swarmed around them and amid\r\ngreat rejoicing carried them to the palace. Not long after, the Princess\r\nbecame the bride of the hero, who put away his fluttering shoes and set\r\nsail in a ship to the island of Seriphus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEPHEUS, THE KING\r\n\r\n[Figure 22]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Cepheus as he is traced among the stars, a king done in\r\nshorthand. He claims no star above the 3rd magnitude, but since his\r\nconstellation is near the North Star and just above the Chair of his\r\nQueen, a large and conspicuous \"W,\" it is easy to find and may be seen\r\nany clear night the year around. Cepheus may be seen at his best during\r\nthe summer evenings when his stars are nearly overhead in the dome of\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n[Figure 23]\r\n\r\nThe other characters in this drama were placed among bright stars and\r\nare therefore more easily found, although to less romantic moderns these\r\nstars merely indicate the part of the sky-field where the ancients claim\r\nthe royal family were lifted to the stars.\r\n\r\n[Figure 24]\r\nBelow Cepheus, on a \"Chair\" of bright stars, sits Cassiopeia, his Queen,\r\nher arms upraised and her face pensive through long ages of humiliating\r\nsorrow; below Cassiopeia stands Perseus transfixed in a heroic attitude,\r\nthe segment of three stars shining against his armor-clad body, his\r\ndiamond-bladed sword thrust among the fainter gleams above his head.\r\n[Figure 25]\r\nThe snaky-locked Gorgon Medusa hangs downward from his shield, while\r\namong its fearful tresses blinks Algol, the Demon Star. On the line\r\nof stars that twinkle at the hero's feet, lies the fair maid Andromeda,\r\nher hands outstretched and bound, and her long, dark hair caught with a\r\nstar on the Square of Pegasus.\r\n[Figure 26]\r\nThe silvery-winged Horse was, oddly enough, placed upside down upon his\r\nconstellation with his head extending earthward from a corner of the\r\n\"Square\" and his feet pawing upward into the darkness. Far below in the\r\nsouth glitters Cetus, Neptune's wicked monster, although Cetus does not\r\nappear until September and is not completely visible until January. The\r\nancient royal family from Ethiopia, now famous for all time, and the\r\nimmortal Perseus, from whom proud kings claim their ancestry, are\r\nconspicuous figures in the northeast during the late summer evenings,\r\nand are at their best here rather than in the dome of the sky or in the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nA small meteor shower radiates from the vicinity of Cepheus during the\r\nlatter part of June. Remember that Cepheus lies up near the North Star\r\nnear the Pole of the Heavens and these meteors will not be difficult to\r\nlocate.\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to note that in the constellation of Cepheus may\r\nbe found the north polar star of the planet Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSIOPEIA, THE QUEEN\r\n\r\n[Figure 27]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Chair of Cassiopeia\" rests upon the path of the Milky Way in the\r\nnorthern part of the heavens. It consists of five bright stars which\r\nsuggest the outlines of an \"M\" or \"W,\" and may be easily located by\r\nprojecting a line drawn from the Big Dipper through the North Star and\r\non again for an equal distance. Thus the Dipper and the \"W\" in beautiful\r\nbalance, teeter, now high and now low, about the pole. The \"W,\"\r\nhowever, is most impressive when near the horizon.\r\n\r\nPoets tell of the silvery currents of the Milky Way that wind in and out\r\namong the stars of this \"Chair,\" but with the telescope one may see more\r\nclearly and perceive that the \"silvery currents\" are a magnificent\r\nwilderness of suns.\r\n\r\n[Figure 28]\r\nWhen the nymphs of the Mediterranean discovered that Cassiopeia had been\r\nhonored with a choice position among the stars, they were perfectly\r\nfurious, and even the sympathy of Juno did not console them as she\r\nrecalled the time that Callisto was transposed as Ursa Major to the\r\nstars. Odd fate that forced an Arcadian maid and an Ethiopian Queen to\r\nfollow each other forever around the Arctic circle of the heavens! The\r\nNereids, however, protested violently to Jupiter that such a reward for\r\nCassiopeia's boasting was unfair and their influence so far prevailed\r\nthat the Queen was set in a tilted fashion and forced to swing half of\r\nevery night with her head hanging downward, and both her arms upraised.\r\nFurthermore, her \"Chair\" was strongly outlined while her queenly person\r\nwas quite ignored. Thus the petty spite of the sea-nymphs was much worse\r\nthan Cassiopeia's boasting.\r\n[Figure 29]\r\nThere was a slight compensation, when, for all this humiliation, two of\r\nthe stars in the \"W\" were named after the Queen's 'heart' and 'hand' by\r\nthe Arabian astronomers,--Alpha, the lower star of the five bright ones,\r\nbeing called Shedir, \"the heart,\" and Beta, in the back of the chair,\r\nCaph, \"the tinted hand.\"\r\n\r\nAbout six centuries ago, a phenomenon happened among the stars in\r\nCassiopeia's constellation, where, suddenly, in a position which\r\nhad previously been blank, a new star shone forth. This star glowed as\r\nbrightly as the planet Venus, which outshines every star in the sky. It\r\nwas so bright that it was even visible in the daytime! This brilliancy\r\nthen commenced to diminish, the star growing fainter and fainter until\r\nin about a year and a half it had completely disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhile new stars have been noted during the course of centuries, the\r\nappearance of one is always so unusual that it stands out against the\r\nbackground of the sky with almost a disquieting effect. The presence of\r\nan additional bright star, strange as it may seem, is immediately\r\nnoticeable to one who is familiar with the constellations. Astronomers\r\nrecord its history with as much interest as the appearance of a new\r\nisland or volcano would occasion on earth.\r\n\r\nTwo theories for temporary stars are given in Moulton's \"Introduction to\r\nAstronomy.\" Professor Moulton tells us that these theories are\r\nsurrounded by serious objections--but they are interesting nevertheless.\r\n\r\nOne is \"that there is invisible nebulous or meteoric matter lying in\r\nvarious parts of space, particularly in the region occupied by the Milky\r\nWay (there is confirmatory evidence of this hypothesis); that there are\r\nalso dark or very faint stars\"--(that is stars which are in the last\r\nstages of cooling, a phenomenon also confirmed)--\"that the dark stars,\r\nrushing through the nebulæ, blaze into incandescence as meteors glow\r\nwhen they enter the earth's atmosphere; that the heating is superficial\r\nand quickly dies away.\" Another hypothesis is that temporary stars \"are\r\nproduced by collisions of stars with stars.\"\r\n\r\nStill another hypothesis among astronomers which has lately gained\r\nconsiderable support is that at the time of an outbreak in a typical\r\nnova (new star), a shell of incandescent gas is actually ejected at an\r\nenormous rate of speed. Such a phenomenon has been witnessed in the case\r\nof one very recent nova.\r\n\r\nA 3-inch telescope will show two interesting double stars on the second\r\npart of the \"W\" of Cassiopeia, although the lower of these double stars\r\nmay also be seen through a 2-inch telescope.\r\n\r\n[Figure 30]\r\nThe lower star (α) is a lovely double, one of its components being a\r\nrose and the other a clear-hued blue; the yellow star above it has a\r\npurple companion which with the larger star whirls around a common\r\ncenter of gravity in a period of about 200 years. Since these stars are\r\nsuns, as all stars are suns, it is often speculated what effect such\r\ncombinations of colors would have on a family of planets,--but only a\r\nmathematical astronomer would be privileged to figure this out, with\r\nsuch complicated days and nights and seasons. Perhaps there would be no\r\nnights--only purple days and yellow days, or blue days and rose days,\r\nwhile peculiar combinations of life--inducing light rays and heat rays\r\nmight produce strange and awesome forms and eerie vegetation!\r\n\r\nCassiopeia, as well as the Big Dipper, has been called a \"celestial\r\nclock\" for one may read the sidereal time from this configuration of\r\nstars with an error not exceeding 15 or 20 minutes. When the star Caph,\r\nor β Cassiopeiæ, is vertically above the Pole Star it is sidereal\r\nnoon; 6 hours when it is on the great circle drawn from the Pole Star to\r\nthe west point of the horizon; 12 hours when vertically below it; and 18\r\nhours when due east. Caph, or β Cassiopeiæ, leads the other stars of\r\nthe constellation in their journey westward.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSEUS, THE HERO\r\n\r\n[Figure 31]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the hero Perseus, easily recognized by the three bright stars\r\nwhich lie in a curved row. These stars hang just below the W-shaped\r\nChair of the unfortunate Queen Cassiopeia who sits in the Milky Way.\r\nAratus, the Greek poet, claims that the sparkles of light which twinkle\r\nin this vicinity are particles of dust which the hero stirred up in his\r\nhaste to rescue Andromeda.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"His giant strides the blue vault climb and move\r\n    A cloud of dust in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a charming picture to impress upon the sky!\r\n\r\nBut now in the twentieth century we analyze this dust which the ancients\r\nclaim their Perseus raised--and what do we find? Every particle in that\r\nmisty path is a mighty sun, suspended amidst multitudes of other mighty\r\nsuns, massed in one long strip of splendor across the sky. For (calmly\r\nspeaking) the Milky Way is a zone of innumerable stars so very distant\r\nthat the individual lights are blended in one continuous band of silvery\r\nhaze.\r\n\r\nAgainst this glorious path stands Perseus, sword upraised among its\r\nstars, while entangled in the fearful locks of the Gorgon Medusa glows\r\nAlgol, the \"Blinking Demon.\" This so-called demon-star actually winks,\r\nthat is, it indulges in one long, slow wink at intervals of exactly 2\r\ndays, 20 hours and 49 minutes. Such a phenomenon used to be a source of\r\nterror to the Arabs who feared it might be predictive of some disaster.\r\n\r\nAlthough Perseus and the Gorgon are figments of fancy the wink of this\r\namazing star is not imaginary by any means, for its light actually drops\r\nfrom the 2nd magnitude to the 4th magnitude and stays thus, half\r\ndarkened, for about 20 minutes. Then it begins to slowly brighten and in\r\nthe course of the next three hours regains its former brilliancy. In the\r\nclear air of the desert where the large stars burn like fire-brands,\r\nthis change in brightness is very noticeable. Since it was not\r\nunderstood, it seemed terrifying and the superstitious Arabs imagined it\r\nto be the eye of a demon. It seemed a fitting star for the ancient\r\nGreeks to place on the grewsome head of the Gorgon Medusa where\r\never after it has flashed and faded in the most eerie fashion.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of this winking star was not discovered until 1889. Then\r\nVogel found that the periodical change of brightness in Algol is caused\r\nby a huge dimly lighted sun,--relatively dark compared with\r\nAlgol,--which revolves around the major sun at a distance of only\r\n3,000,000 miles. (The earth revolves at a distance of 93,000,000 miles\r\nfrom our sun.) Every time this darker body passes between Algol and the\r\nearth, five-sixths of the light from Algol is cut off, thus making it\r\nappear to blink. Vogel also found, through the aid of the spectroscope,\r\nthe diameter and mass of these stars. Algol was found to be about one\r\nmillion miles in diameter with a mass less than half that of the sun\r\nwhile its companion was found to be about 800,000 miles in diameter with\r\na mass about one fourth that of our sun.\r\n\r\nThirty stars are now known to be of the Algol type. One of the most\r\nremarkable of these, V. Puppis, was found to be in the southern\r\nhemisphere and was carefully examined by Dr. A. W. Roberts. This star\r\nhas a light variation of only 1½ days and is believed to whirl so\r\nclosely to its companion that it is in actual contact.\r\n\r\nThe most favorable seasons for seeing Algol during the early evening are\r\nin the autumn, winter and early spring; in the autumn, low in the\r\nnortheast, when it rises at sunset in the middle of September; in the\r\nwinter, high up in the north, not far from the zenith; and in the\r\nspring, low down in the northwest. At the correct time it is possible\r\nfor anyone to see its change in brilliancy although the best time to\r\nwatch for this is during September and October. Algol rises at sunset in\r\nthe middle of September and consumes 9 hours and 12 minutes in reaching\r\nthe meridian. To best appreciate the change in this star compare it with\r\nthe stars near by, especially to the 4th magnitude star that lies quite\r\nnear to it.\r\n\r\nThus Perseus holds Algol on the Gorgon's head which flashes with \"fiery\r\nsnakes,\"--his right hand brandishes a glittering sword, his armor is\r\ndecked with stars, while the 'dust' he raised swirls in a milky path\r\nfrom the zenith to the trees on the horizon.\r\n\r\nIn the Sword Hand of Perseus the ancient Greeks saw the gleam of the\r\nsword borrowed from Mercury, a diamond-bladed, diamond-hilted sword,\r\ncarved from a single diamond, but modern astronomers searching in the\r\nsame spot discovered a more wonderful object for, through the eye of a\r\ntelescope, the two nebulous patches of hazy light on the Sword Hand were\r\nresolved into countless stars! These star clusters are interesting even\r\nin a field-glass although higher powers disclose them as veritable\r\nsun-bursts of diamond-like stars. The two clusters may be located about\r\nhalf-way between Mirfak, the brightest star in the Segment of Perseus,\r\nand the \"W\" of Cassiopeia.\r\n\r\nOne might at first glance take these crowded masses of stars as an\r\nexample where the great force of gravity had worked not wisely but too\r\nwell; but it is only the unbelievable distance that our earth lies from\r\nthese stars which makes them look so closely clustered together. Would\r\nthe brighter naked-eye stars which bespangle our sky look like this--a\r\nglimmering spot--from so vast a distance? To know that our solar cluster\r\nof stars is not the only cluster in the heavens is enough to take a\r\nlittle of the conceit out of man's colossal opinion of himself.\r\n\r\nA good meteor shower appears in the vicinity of the constellation of\r\nPerseus about the 10th of August. These meteors are best seen around\r\nthree o'clock in the morning and have been recorded as appearing as far\r\nback as 811 A.D. This would seem to reasonably assure the annual\r\nreappearance of the spectacle but since the number of meteors is\r\nsteadily decreasing there is a time in the future when it will cease to\r\nbe. These meteors are popularly known as the \"Tears of Saint Lawrence,\"\r\nmentioned as the \"fiery tears\" in ancient legends because Saint\r\nLawrence was burned at the stake upon the 10th of August in the \"sad old\r\ndays\" of religious intolerance. Every year, like ghosts, his tears\r\nreturn and rain down from the sky in drops of fire. They fall at the\r\nrate of about one a minute. Miss Proctor, in \"Half Hours with the Summer\r\nStars,\" mentions a quaint old oriental legend in which the meteors are\r\nsupposed to be darts which are thrown by the angels at the evil ones who\r\nare barred from heaven and eavesdrop at its gates.\r\n\r\nThe myth which is woven about the hero Perseus is a very beautiful one\r\nand a few words as to why the Greeks so loved this gallant lad might be\r\nwell appreciated by those who are not familiar with the story.\r\n\r\nAcrisius, King of Argos, was so selfish and quarrelsome that finally\r\nJupiter, who watched over the affairs of mankind, determined to give him\r\nsomething real to worry about, so Acrisius was informed through an\r\noracle that he would lose his crown and die by the hand of his own\r\ngrandson. Soon after this Perseus was born, and the King was indeed\r\nterrified. His fear increased daily, finally bringing him to such a\r\nstate of madness that he placed the Princess Danae, his own daughter,\r\nand her little son in a large chest and threw it into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe gods, however, watched the chest and held it steady among the\r\nroughest waves, finally stranding it in the sea-weed on the little\r\nIsland of Seriphus where the wanderers were rescued and given a home.\r\n\r\nYears passed, and the King of Seriphus grew to love Danae, but he feared\r\nPerseus who looked like a golden-haired god. One day this king planned a\r\ngreat feast and informed his guests that each must bring a gift as proof\r\nof his loyalty, and the gift must be either costly or rare. Since\r\nPerseus had no wealth, the king suggested that he bring to court the\r\nhead of the Gorgon Medusa who lived across the sea in the wilds of a\r\nstrange and distant land.\r\n\r\nWith his heart filled with sorrow at the thought of this wellnigh\r\nimpossible task, Perseus went out into the fields and walked about\r\nalone. What chance had he against this fearful creature that had the\r\nwings of an eagle and hair that writhed in living snakes about her\r\nshoulders, and coiled and hissed and darted on her head? More than this,\r\nher eyes were filled with horror and turned all who gazed upon her into\r\nstone! Walking along thus enwrapped in dreary thoughts, the youth felt\r\nhimself suddenly grow buoyant, and looking down on his sandals saw that\r\nliving wings had grown upon their heels; then a polished shield\r\nreflecting like a mirror was hung upon his arm, and a sword carved from\r\na diamond, which must have once equaled the size of a bowlder, was\r\nthrust into his hand. The gods had again taken care of their own!\r\nHolding himself proudly, our hero walked to the end of the island where\r\na high cliff jutted above the rocky shore below. He stood on the edge\r\nand looked down at the rocks beneath him; then he raised his head and\r\nlooked at the high white clouds in the sunny sky. He thought of the gods\r\nand his mother--and bravely stepped over—then laughed joyously as he\r\nskimmed like a bird in the warm rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is a long tale to tell how he journeyed northward to the land of snow\r\nand ice, then southward again, and across the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"He saw the southern, and the northern pole:\r\n    And eastward thrice, and westward thrice, was whirl'd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter finding the Three Gray Sisters who had but one eye between them,\r\nPerseus forced them to tell him where to find the country where the\r\nGorgons dwelt. After many hardships, he found this country on the\r\nwestern shore of Africa and knew it immediately, for all around stood\r\nthe images of men and beasts whose flesh and blood the Medusa's eyes had\r\nhardened into stone:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Beasts to the rocks were fix'd and all around\r\n    Were tribes of stone and marble nations found.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Lucan's Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere, amid the rocks, lay the Medusa asleep, with half of the snakes\r\nawake and squirming restlessly. With his eyes on the reflection in the\r\nshield, the son of Danae swooped quickly downward, cut off the monster's\r\nhead and grasped its clammy, lifeless locks in his hand.\r\n\r\nWinging his way over northern Africa, Perseus came to the mountain on\r\nwhich the Titan Atlas sat, hunched up on a peak with his shoulders\r\nsagging under the weight of the heavens. Somewhat weary after his long\r\nflight, the youth landed in the Garden of the Hesperides, which lay at\r\nthe foot of the mountain, and watched the maidens, daughters of\r\nHesperus, the silver Evening Star, as they danced around a shining tree\r\nof golden apples. But he dared not touch or even go near the apples, for\r\naround the trunk was coiled old Laden, a monstrous dragon whose watchful\r\neyes were never closed. He then climbed up to the top of the mountain to\r\ntalk to Atlas, but Atlas did not receive him hospitably for an oracle\r\nhad declared that the day would come when a son of Jupiter would take\r\nhis golden fruit, and he had therefore forbidden strangers to come into\r\nhis land. Perseus begged for just one night of rest, but Atlas roared in\r\nanger and would not even listen to him. \"Have a rest yourself, then!\"\r\nshouted our hero, and held up the Gorgon's head. The great giant gave\r\none startled look, which was plenty, for the features of his face grew\r\nstiff as weather-beaten ledges, his bones congealed like a mass of Tock,\r\nand his beard stuck out like a forest of naked trees! Perseus hurriedly\r\nswung the head behind him and, a trifle panic-stricken perhaps, flew\r\naway over the African desert with the blood falling drip, drip, drip on\r\nthe hot, gray sands.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The gory drops distilled, as swift he flew,\r\n    And from each drop envenomed serpents grew.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus from this monster Nature produced the first snakes, which bred and\r\nmultiplied on the desert until the region was infested with the\r\nmiserable creatures.\r\n\r\nThe great dark splash which the sea had caught when first he rose in the\r\nair after beheading the Gorgon, had formed the silvery winged Pegasus,\r\nthe world's first horse. This splendid animal, however, did not stay\r\nwith Perseus, but spread its beautiful feathered wings in the air and\r\nflew directly to Greece, where it was presented to the Muses on Mount\r\nHelicon and afterwards given a constellation.\r\n\r\nFlying over mountains and deserts and the narrow green valley of the\r\nNile, Perseus came to the shore of Palestine, the home of the\r\nEthiopians, which he found inundated with floods and strewn with the\r\nwreckage of towns and villages. Traveling slowly above the sea-coast of\r\nthis unfortunate country, he spied something white at the water's edge,\r\nand coming closer saw that it was a maiden chained by her wrists and\r\nankles to a rock, while not far distant and ever approaching closer, was\r\nthe most terrifying monster that he had ever seen. On the star maps this\r\ncreature is labeled a \"whale.\" It may have been a whale, and it may not,\r\nwho knows? Sixty or seventy feet of whale lashing a tail big enough to\r\ndestroy a large boat would certainly seem a terrible sea-monster to\r\npeople who had never seen a whale. How could they know that its fifteen\r\nor sixteen feet of gaping mouth had never tasted anything but tiny\r\ncrustaceans and acalephæ strained from sea-water! Hero indeed was\r\nPerseus, for he skimmed swiftly down to a nearby wave, and poising upon\r\nits frothy peak, thrust the monster deep below the jaw. A brave, brave\r\ndeed was this, and the people shouted their vast amazement and delight.\r\nAs the great sea-creature leaped and lunged and fell, Perseus again\r\nsnatched the blood-freezing head of the Medusa from his wallet--and the\r\ncliffs trembled as the monster hit the bottom of the sea!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 32: THE STORY OF ANDROMEDA IMMORTALIZED IN STARS.\r\n\r\n   \"She still in heaven her captive form retains,\r\n    And on her wrists still hang the galling chains.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Aratus._]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to some of the poets, Jupiter was so inordinately proud of the\r\nyouth's achievements, that he caused all the principal characters in his\r\nadventures to be immortalized in stars, the sea-monster sharing the\r\nhonor in a dim constellation far to the south. He, as well as the horse,\r\nhas been given a name and even grave astronomers call him \"Cetus.\"\r\n\r\nFor a thousand years the famous rock was shown at Joppa and the slaying\r\nof the Medusa and the rescue of Andromeda were favorite subjects in\r\nancient art. Artists thrilled to their theme as they made it glow in\r\ncolors on their canvases, and poets made the story live again and again.\r\nIf anyone wonders what became of the awful Medusa's head after Perseus\r\nhad won Andromeda for his bride, it might be well to add that after\r\nreducing two courts of cowardly nobles to statues of stone, Perseus gave\r\nthe head to the goddess Minerva who placed it on her shield. This\r\ngoddess is very chaste and with the fearful head has since succeeded in\r\nfreezing all beholders.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDROMEDA, THE PRINCESS\r\n\r\n[Figure 33]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charming Princess Andromeda wears her chains in the sky just as she\r\ndid upon the sea-shore of the earth, only as a constellation she has a\r\nline of pretty yellow stars on which to rest, one of the stars lighting\r\nher dark hair, one adorning her girdle and one sparkling like a jewel\r\nupon her sandal. The head of the Princess lies against the Square of\r\nPegasus, the Winged Horse, and her feet reach out almost to Perseus, who\r\nwith a ready sword watches her protectingly.\r\n\r\nThe orange star on Andromeda's sandal is the radiant point of the Biela\r\nmeteors. These appear every year on the 27th of November. This star is a\r\ndelight to the eye when viewed through a large telescope, for not\r\nonly one star is disclosed but three--a sea-green and a blue beside the\r\none of orange-gold!\r\n\r\nJust above Mirach, the star on the girdle, are two fainter stars and a\r\nsmall misty object. A large telescope will show that this misty object\r\nis a long shuttle-shaped nebula of the most colossal size. This is the\r\nfamous nebula of Andromeda, the only spiral nebula in the heavens which\r\nmay be located without a telescope. The nebula of Andromeda is not a\r\ngaseous nebula but an outside universe, an aggregation of millions of\r\nsuns comparable to the Galaxy. (The Galaxy is our Milky Way.)\r\n[Figure 34]\r\nThis in itself is astounding, but it is also astounding that we have\r\nbeen privileged to gaze over a chasm so wide that an aggregation of\r\nmillions of suns looks no more to our eyes than a misty spot of light.\r\nDr. Edwin Hubble, of the Mount Wilson observatory in California, has\r\nrecently made the discovery that the more distant spiral nebulæ may\r\nalso be resolved into stars. Dr. Hubble made his investigations\r\nphotographically with the 60-inch and 100-inch telescopes. Although most\r\nof the spiral nebulæ appear very small because they are at least a\r\nmillion light years distant, the nebula of Andromeda is comparatively\r\nclose, its apparent diameter being about six times the diameter of the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nThis famous nebula may be most easily located when near the zenith\r\nduring the latter part of October. Watch for it just after the star\r\nAlpheratz, on the head of Andromeda, has passed the meridian and started\r\ntoward the west.\r\n\r\n[Figure 35: THE GREAT NEBULA OF ANDROMEDA.\r\nPhotograph by Yerkes Observatory through the 40-inch refracting\r\ntelescope.]\r\n\r\nTo the unaided eye, it appears as a small mass of faint light and\r\ninexperienced observers often mistake it for a comet. Although this mass\r\nof light may be considered as being comparatively close compared to\r\nother spiral nebula, it is scarcely like sighting a ship at sea, for so\r\nfar away does the spiral of Andromeda lie, that a ray of light must\r\ntravel at least 36,000 years in order to reach the earth--36,000 years\r\nwith light traveling 186,000 miles a second!\r\n\r\n\r\nPEGASUS, THE FLYING HORSE\r\n\r\n[Figure 36]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constellation of Pegasus, the Winged Horse of the Muses, is marked\r\nby a great square formed by four bright stars. This \"square\" lies\r\nagainst the horse's neck and wings, while his head, adorned by the star\r\nEnif, hangs downward from one corner and stretches toward the west.\r\n[Figure 37]\r\nEnif lies about 10 degrees west of a small but conspicuous\r\ndiamond-shaped constellation called The Dolphin, or Job's Coffin.\r\n\r\nAlthough Pegasus is close to Perseus in the sky, this winged horse was\r\nnot with the hero either at the time he met Andromeda or at any other\r\nperiod of his life. Since only half of his body is represented on\r\nhis star square it is sometimes said that the remainder is hidden behind\r\nthe rocks to which Andromeda is chained. The reason that artists so\r\noften draw Pegasus beside the hero Perseus must be that they take the\r\nastronomical picture instead of the mythological version of the story as\r\na basis for their theme, although his unnatural position of being upside\r\ndown is studiously ignored;--even the ancient poets refrained from\r\ncomment upon this point.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark, in \"Astronomy from a Dipper,\" aptly remarks that \"the square\r\nsuggests a box-stall in which a horse could be kept rather than a portion\r\nof a great flying horse.\" There is certainly \"more truth than poetry\" in\r\nthis idea and just about all of the constellations look most like \"what\r\nthey are not.\" Not possessing the vivid imagery of the Greeks, most of\r\nus must be content with looking at the bright Square which marks the\r\nplace of the great Winged Horse in the darkness.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that when Perseus swooped down and cut the head off\r\nthe Gorgon, its life-blood crimsoned the foam on the sea. Neptune,\r\nseeing this, spun it into silver with the wind and waves, and formed, in\r\na moment, the wondrous horse.\r\n\r\nBorn full-grown, gifted with immortal life and blessed with incredible\r\nspeed, Pegasus lifted his silvery wings and sprang toward the clouds. He\r\nthen rushed headlong toward Mount Helicon where he flew about the\r\nmountain, alighted in its sacred groves, and was petted by the Muses.\r\n\r\nAccording to all accounts the hoofs of this beautiful creature must have\r\npossessed not only miraculous strength but also some of the properties\r\nof a divining-rod, for, when thirsty, all that he needs must do was to\r\nstrike his magic hoof upon the ground and up would spout a fountain or a\r\nspring—crystal clear and delightfully cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"He it was, men say, that brought down from lofty\r\n    Helicon the bright waters of bounteous Hippocrene.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fountain of Hippocrene was the result of an almost unbelievable\r\nexhibition of strength which occurred, as the story goes,\r\nat the time that the nine Muses and the nine daughters of Pierus\r\nengaged in a musical contest on Mount Helicon. When the nine\r\ndaughters of Pierus began to sing, the heavens scowled and grew\r\ndark, but when the nine Muses lifted their voices in song, the skies\r\ngrew gold with sunlight, the rivers stopped spellbound in their\r\ncourses and Mount Helicon rose skyward in sheer delight. Neptune,\r\nobserving the mountain, advised Pegasus to stop its ascension\r\nby kicking it with his hoof. The winged steed kicked and not\r\nonly quenched the rising enthusiasm of Helicon, but caused the\r\nwaters of Hippocrene to burst forth from the very crest of a vast\r\nrock. Poets were not long in discovering that a draught of these\r\nsparkling waters fired their minds with divine inspiration, and\r\nthe beauty in their souls grew like flowers into poems which stayed\r\nfresh and fair through all succeeding centuries. No wonder\r\nmodern poets sigh\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"for a beaker full of the warm south\r\n    Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,\r\n    With beaded bubbles winking on the brim.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty \"stadia\" below the Fountain lay the Grove of the Muses, situated\r\nin a pleasant hollow, while below this Grove, at the foot of Helicon,\r\nwas the village of Ascra, the residence of Hesiod, and the earliest seat\r\nof poetry in Greece. One can imagine that the poets made frequent trips\r\nup the two miles or so that brought them to the Fountain of the Horse.\r\nIn modern times, Hippocrene has been identified with a fine spring at\r\nMakariotissa.\r\n\r\nThe limpid spring of Pirene on the citadel of Corinth was also opened by\r\na blow from the winged horse's foot. The water from Pirene was in later\r\ndays conveyed down the hill by subterranean conduits into a marble basin\r\nmade especially to hold it Pegasus was not given credit for having\r\nopened these springs, however, until the days of the Alexandrian poets.\r\nIn lovely fancies, these \"Spring-inspired\" poets not only extolled the\r\nwondrous strength in the hoof of Pegasus as he cleft a chasm in the\r\nearth, but they also sang of so light a foot that he no more than shook\r\nthe sweetness from the flowers.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Pegasus flew about Mount Helicon, adored by the Muses\r\nand admired by the gods, but finally one day, while drinking at a\r\nspring, he was captured by a Grecian youth named Bellerophon. After\r\nmaking him fast with a golden bridle loaned to him by Minerva,\r\nBellerophon mounted the broad back, slipped his feet between the wings\r\nand soared to the sky. As might have been expected, Bellerophon\r\nhenceforth spent a good part of his time along the dizzying heights\r\nabove and around the clouds and one day accomplished the praiseworthy\r\ndeed of swooping down and slaying a triple-headed monster which had been\r\nterrorizing all the surrounding land.\r\n\r\nAfter this famous ride, Bellerophon seized what he considered a good\r\nopportunity and tried to ascend to the top of the broad summit of Mount\r\nOlympus which towered almost twice as high as the summit of Mount\r\nHelicon. But Mount Olympus was the abode of the gods and this\r\npresumptuous act so angered Jupiter that he sent an insect to torment\r\nthe steed which reared backward and threw its rider to the earth. Being\r\nnow quite accustomed to a rider, Pegasus was presented to Aurora,\r\nGoddess of the Dawn, whose duty it was to lift the curtain of night with\r\nher rosy tinted fingers and open the eastern gates for Apollo, the\r\nSun-god. In art Aurora is often pictured as a spirited maiden in\r\ndazzling robes riding swiftly on the winged Pegasus, although she is\r\nalso represented as rising out of the ocean in the east in a car drawn\r\nby four white horses. Perhaps she decided to employ the latter\r\nexclusively to usher in the dawn, for Pegasus was later transposed to\r\nthe stars and never again permitted to stray earthward. His great\r\ndark sky square with a star on each corner is exceedingly easy to find\r\nespecially during September when it is on the sky slope in the east,\r\nalthough if there is any difficulty in locating it, let the eye travel\r\nfrom Cassiopeia to the Segment of Perseus--which resembles a rod bent in\r\nthe middle and swayed by the weight of this big chained Square.\r\n\r\nThe Square rises and sets in a tilted fashion with its corner star,\r\nScheat, on the horse's knee, almost above Algenib, which lies on his\r\nwing.\r\n[Figure 38]\r\n\"as if by art at equal distance placed.\" This causes the Square to\r\nresemble a distorted diamond-shaped figure when seen in the east or west\r\nbut when the figure travels along the south about nine o'clock during\r\nthe latter part of October or the first of November, its sides are\r\nhorizontal and vertical.\r\n\r\nThe Winged Horse first makes his appearance in the northeast near\r\nmidnight in the middle of June but is better seen in the east between\r\nnine and ten o'clock a little later in the summer. Any time during the\r\nAutumn he may be seen flying inverted across the dome of the heavens and\r\nby November is high in the west. Evening after evening his silvery wings\r\nfly lower and lower; the star Enif flutters as it nears the thickened\r\natmosphere about the horizon and Andromeda probably trembles as he\r\ndraws her near Cetus, head downward through the western sky.\r\n\r\n[Figure 39: The Winged Horse flies head downward\r\nin the west.]\r\n\r\n\"The head of Andromeda is setting and against her is brought by the\r\nMisty South the mighty terror, Cetus, but over in the North Cepheus with\r\nhis mighty hand upraised warns him back.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\nBy the first of the year the starry \"Square\" of the beautiful Pegasus\r\nhas entirely disappeared. Andromeda and Perseus soon follow but\r\nCassiopeia continues around the horizon in the north. Throughout the\r\nspring and early summer Pegasus remains in regions below our sight but\r\nin September he again appears and flies inverted up the heavens in the\r\neast.\r\n\r\n\r\nCETUS, THE SEA-MONSTER\r\n\r\n[Figure 40]\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly poets describe Cetus as a monster armored with heavy scales or as\r\nbeing long-necked and clawed, which brings to mind the sea-reptiles\r\nwhich are known to have inhabited the sea during the Mesozoic Age.\r\nAlthough poets are known for their tendency to exaggerate, this in\r\nitself is enough to lend a spicy interest to the legend, for one's\r\nthoughts fly back to the world's young days when reptiles of great\r\nsize literally overran the earth and cluttered up the sea. Many of these\r\nforms have been reconstructed from fossils found embedded in the rock\r\nstrata. These are most amazing, grotesque and even terrifying and may be\r\nseen in any of the great museums. If a museum is not handy one may\r\nshiver with real thrills by going through the pages of a well\r\nillustrated text on geology.\r\n\r\nSome such creature as one of these was Cetus,--according to the poets.\r\nSome authors think that the whole story of Andromeda is an allegory;\r\nothers, that it may have been based, though somewhat lightly, upon a\r\nhistorical fact. Ancient authorities (Pliny, Josephus and others), claim\r\nthat the bones of Cetus were brought from Joppa to Rome and there\r\nexhibited by M. Scarus, and it is also claimed that the people along the\r\nsea-coast at this time were driven forth in hysterical fear, for when\r\nthe monster appeared it not only swallowed up the cattle as they came to\r\nbrowse at the river's mouth but also snatched the children as they\r\nsplashed about at play. Mythology tells us that Hercules, as well as\r\nPerseus, once killed such a sea-monster as this and it is then related\r\nthat he tried to narrow the width of the strait leading into the\r\nMediterranean by pushing the rocks on either shore closer together so as\r\nto prevent further invasions of Neptune's fierce and terrible creatures.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of Cetus differ in the old star-maps although he is almost\r\nalways represented as being strange and ferocious. After having drawn\r\nthe animal, however, with scales and claws, a mad, mad tail and\r\nsometimes even rows of teeth, the mapmaker becomes conservative and\r\ncalls it \"Cetus, the Whale.\"\r\n\r\nAs a constellation, Cetus first begins to appear in September but does\r\nnot get fully above the horizon for almost four months. By January he is\r\ncompletely visible, his huge, faint form covering over 40 degrees of\r\nsky. His head is rather pentagonal as impressed among the stars and\r\nextends on a long neck above the celestial equator; his tail is\r\neven longer than his neck and curls upward as if he were angry--which he\r\nassuredly was when petrified by Perseus into stone. His sides are clear\r\nand black with unadorned sky-space and seem quite devoid of even the\r\nfainter stars.\r\n\r\nAlways look for Cetus in the southeast, south or southwest, in front of\r\nand below Orion and far below Andromeda. The point of the V-shaped\r\nHyades also directs the eye toward his pentagonal head which extends\r\ntoward the east.\r\n\r\nJust about in the center of the long, giraffe-like neck of Cetus, the\r\nvillain in our play, lies Myra, a most extraordinary star.\r\n\r\n[Figure 41: Cetus, the Whale.]\r\n\r\nThis star is called \"Myra, the Wonderful\" because of its amazing\r\nbehavior in a period of only eleven months. For three months Myra is\r\nvisible to the unaided eye; during the other eight it can only be seen\r\nin a good telescope. Put in another way--for five months at a time it is\r\ncompletely invisible to the unaided eye; then from a mere speck it\r\nslowly brightens until in the course of three months more it has become\r\na star of the 2nd magnitude, although it remains a star of the 2nd\r\nmagnitude for only a few weeks. This change from a telescopic star of\r\nthe 9th or 10th magnitude to one of the 2nd magnitude means that Myra\r\nmust blaze up from 1000 times to 1500 times its ordinary brilliancy!\r\nSuch a statement may overwhelm the casual reader but we must remember\r\n(in order not to become unduly excited) that this star is so far\r\naway that such a conflagration would only mean the gradual appearance of\r\na star where none had been visible before, and then its gradual\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\nMyra is indeed so far away that we are just 23 years behind time in\r\nseeing each explosion, for it takes 23 years for its light to travel to\r\nour eyes. If the roar of the conflagration could be heard here, however,\r\nthe sound would not reach the earth for many millions of years, for\r\nsound travels much more slowly than light.\r\n\r\n[Figure 42: Myra, the wonderful variable star, on the neck of Cetus,\r\nthe Sea-monster.]\r\n\r\nBecause of the variation of its light, which is very excessive in the\r\ncase of Myra, this star is called a variable star. Our sun is also a\r\nvariable star, but it is variable only in a very slight degree as\r\ncompared with the exuberant combustibility of Myra. But the theory of\r\nspots which are believed to be responsible for the almost imperceptible\r\nvariation in the light intensity of our sun does not altogether explain\r\nthe phenomenon of Myra's variability and its mystery is still as great\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\nThus is ended the story of Perseus and Andromeda and many of the\r\ninteresting bits of information connected with the constellations\r\nof the various characters after they were transferred to the sky.\r\n\r\nThree small constellations lie between Andromeda, Cetus and the Square\r\nof Pegasus, and a word about them here will help to impress this part of\r\nthe sky upon the mind without the trouble of carrying maps every time\r\none feels inclined to gaze at the stars. These constellations are\r\nPisces, the Fish; Triangulum, the Triangle and Aries, the Ram.\r\n\r\n[Figure 43]\r\n\r\nPisces represents two small fish tied by their tails by two long 'star\r\nlines' which meet at a common star sometimes called Al Rischa or the\r\n\"Knot Star.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Their tails point to an angle\r\n    Filled by a goodly star.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the constellation occupies a large space in the heavens it has\r\nno conspicuous stars in it. It is best seen when the parallelogram of\r\nOrion is in the sky and may be located above and to the west of Cetus.\r\nLook for it on the first of January about 8 P. M. although it is\r\nalso viewed to good advantage when passing the meridian during the\r\nevenings of October and November. Pisces lies in a region which in early\r\ntimes was known as \"the Sea\" because several other sea-creatures such as\r\nthe Dolphin, which lies west of the Square, the Sea-goat and the Whale\r\nare found here.\r\n\r\nSome authorities claim that when the fire-breathing giant Typhon\r\nappeared in Thessaly, the horrible creature so frightened the\r\ninhabitants of Olympus that they fled to the Nile where they concealed\r\nthemselves under assumed shapes. Here the great god Jupiter\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"was changed into a Ram\r\n    From whence the horns of Libyan Ammon came.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand the fun loving Pan into a sea-goat, now the constellation\r\nCapricornus, while the goddess Venus and her son Cupid threw themselves\r\ninto the river and were changed into two fishes, which are now\r\nrepresented by Pisces, in the sky. The fate of Typhon has already been\r\nmentioned, and even modern Sicilians have seen Etna burst its crown to\r\nlet out his fiery breath.\r\n\r\nJust below Andromeda and above the head of Cetus is a long slim\r\ntriangle-shaped figure called Triangulum, the Triangle, and a crooked\r\nline formed by a large star and two smaller ones called Aries, the Ram.\r\n\r\nIn legend, Aries was a great ram with a golden fleece and possessed the\r\nability to fly. Mercury brought this beautiful creature to Helle and\r\nPrixus, the persecuted children of the King of Thessaly, so that they\r\nmight climb upon its back and escape across the sea from their cruel\r\nstepmother. On the way over, Helle lost her hold on the fleece, sank\r\nunder the waves and was drowned. Commemorating this tragedy, the sea was\r\never after called the Sea of Helle or the Hellespont but in modern days,\r\nthe Dardanelles. The Dardanelles is a narrow channel separating Europe\r\nfrom Asia, and is the \"Hellespont\" that Leander so faithfully swam when\r\nvisiting Hero, his sweetheart. Prixus, coming safely to the end of\r\nhis journey, dedicated the ram to Jupiter who placed it among the stars.\r\nIt is now a zodiacal constellation with the horns of the ram for its\r\nsign: ♈︎. The golden fleece, while on earth, was of course very\r\ndesirable so that it was fastened to an oak tree in the sacred grove of\r\nthe War-god Mars at the eastern end of the Black Sea and a sleepless\r\ndragon was wound around the tree-trunk to protect it. It was to obtain\r\nthis fleece that, in 936 B. C., Jason built a fifty-oared galley--the\r\nfirst of ships--and invited the heroes of Greece to go with him on the\r\nexpedition. This adventurous undertaking was afterward known as the\r\nArgonautic Expedition. The ship Argo was placed in the sky as a southern\r\nconstellation, or at least a part of it was for the bow is said to have\r\nbeen lost when passing through the Bosporus.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Argo, exalted for that daring feat\r\n    To fix in heaven her shape with stars.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even the portion that was lifted to the sky is so large that\r\nastronomers, for convenience, have divided it into three parts,--Carina,\r\nthe Keel; Puppis, the Stern; and Vela, the Sail. The beautiful star\r\nCanopus lies on the Keel.\r\n\r\nTriangulum and Aries, traveling beneath Andromeda, rise in late\r\nSeptember and October and pass the meridian in the early evenings during\r\nthe first weeks of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 44: THE PARADE OF THE ZENITH CONSTELLATIONS.\r\nDuring the spring and summer months these clearly marked constellations\r\nparade slowly across the dome of the heavens. Leo, the Lion, may be\r\neasily located beneath the Big Dipper.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PARADE OF THE ZENITH CONSTELLATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nLEO, THE LION\r\n\r\n[Figure 45]\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT 9 o'clock on the 8th of April, a large, bright sickle passes near\r\nthe zenith. This sickle lies just south of the Big Dipper and is a\r\nclearly defined figure among the other designs which decorate the sky\r\nduring the early spring.\r\n\r\n[Figure 46]\r\n\r\nTruly, this is a strange symbol to see emblazoned in the heavens; has it\r\ntoo a story? Indeed, yes; this cluster of stars is the Sickle of Leo and\r\nlies on the head of the fierce Nemean lion which came from the moon and\r\nwhich was later killed by Hercules and transferred to the starry sky.\r\nThe lion's head rests in the curve of the figure; his shaggy neck on the\r\nshort straight line and his heart beneath the bright star on the end.\r\n\r\n[Figure 47]\r\nNot far away lies the rest of this brave creature with another bright\r\nstar on the tuft of his tail. Drawn together, the sickle and the\r\ntriangle now suggest a very dignified lion, although in the old star\r\natlases he is pictured as a very ferocious lion transfixed in a moment\r\nof action.\r\n\r\nNote well this curious sickle-shaped figure beneath the bowl of the Big\r\nDipper. We will take this figure just at present, as a leader,\r\nwhile calling attention to the oddly assorted but interestingly\r\nassembled groups of stars which follow Leo in a widely curved path near\r\nthe dome of the heavens, from the far northeast to the far northwest.\r\n\r\n[Figure 48]\r\nThese groups appear one by one like a line of floats pulled up over the\r\nhorizon; then drawn in a glittering procession toward the west. Each\r\nevening they appear farther along in their journey westward,--a pageant\r\nfar distant in the darkness yet visible by the gleaming of its lights.\r\n\r\nClosely following Leo, the Leader, is a representation in faint golden\r\nstarlight of Queen Berenice's Hair; next the lovely orange-yellow star,\r\nArcturus, on the dim kite-shaped figure of Boötes, the Herdsman; then a\r\ncrown of star gems which belonged to Ariadne, daughter of an ancient\r\nking of Crete; a huge giant called Hercules; the golden Lyre with which\r\nApollo raised the walls of Troy and Orpheus charmed the souls in Hades;\r\nand last, but not least, a large and beautiful Cross.\r\n\r\nThe Lion disappears behind the western \"bulge of the world\" during the\r\nearly summer, although the last of the procession, the great Cross borne\r\non the back of Cygnus, the Swan, does not even reach the meridian--the\r\nline midway between east and west--until September. Some of these groups\r\nare also seen later than October, but at that time their splendor is\r\ndimmed by the gorgeous winter constellations in the southeast.\r\n\r\nAccording to the classic legend of the Greeks, Leo was the celebrated\r\nNemean Lion which Hercules killed as the first of the Twelve Labors\r\nwhich were imposed upon him by his cousin Eurystheus, who was king of the\r\nPerseidæ only through priority of birth. This lion was the largest and\r\nfiercest lion in the world with a skin so invulnerable that no arrow had\r\never succeeded in even denting it. The huge beast was also so\r\nrapacious that it was fast annihilating all the inhabitants of Nemea,\r\nwhich was the ancient name of the deep valley of Argolis. Hercules had\r\nno trouble in tracking the lion through the valley, which was only two\r\nor three miles long and half a mile broad, and easily found its den.\r\nRushing in, he barricaded the opening, grasped the lion by the throat\r\nand after a terrific struggle, crushed the beast in his arms. Ever after\r\nhe wore the tough, impenetrable skin as a covering for his own defense.\r\nThe Nemean games, one of the national festivals of the Greeks, are\r\nbelieved to have been founded by Hercules after his victory over the\r\nNemean lion. There is some evidence that there was a lion traced among\r\nthe stars before the time of Hercules, but, if so, the Greeks erased the\r\nimpression and substituted their own lion in its stead.\r\n\r\nLeo, the Nemean lion in stars, is seen at his best during the early\r\nevenings of March, April, May and June, although he makes his first\r\nappearance on the 4th of March when, just as the sun sets in the west,\r\nhis tail rises above the eastern horizon. In April he is at his highest\r\npoint in his path across the sky, lying just to the south and below the\r\nbowl of the Big Dipper.\r\n\r\n[Figure 49]\r\nOn the end of the handle of the Sickle shines Regulus, also called Cor\r\nLeonis which means \"The Heart of the Lion.\" Regulus sends out 300 times\r\nas much light as our sun, but is so far away that it takes 99 years for\r\nits light to reach us. This star rises in the northeast at twilight on\r\nthe 15th of February and crosses the meridian at 8 o'clock on April\r\n23rd.\r\n\r\nOne generally thinks of stars as being bright and gay, but Regulus has a\r\ncompanion which is somber and so unusual in its appearance as compared\r\nwith other stars that it was described by Winlock, its discoverer, as if\r\n\"steeped in indigo.\" Later it was found that this oddly colored\r\nstar also has a companion which makes Regulus a triple star.\r\n\r\nThe second star above Regulus is also interesting. This star is a\r\nbeautiful double described in such refreshing terms as \"golden-orange\"\r\nand \"bronze-green.\" It may be seen in a medium sized telescope. Later we\r\nwill become acquainted with a wonderful red star which also has a green\r\ncompanion. Such combinations are most amazing to gaze upon.\r\n\r\nThe second brightest star adorning Leo is Denebola, which flashes on the\r\nend of his tail. Denebola is 10 times as bright as our sun and is 25\r\nlight years away. Since Regulus, on the heart of the Lion, is 99 light\r\nyears distant and Denebola, on the tail of the Lion, is only 25 light\r\nyears, science has certainly played havoc with the poor Nemean lion.\r\nProctor tells us that Coma Berenices (Berenice's Hair) was originally\r\nthe tuft of the tail of the lion when the constellation was pictured in\r\nthe maps as being more extended. This was quite an appropriate place for\r\nthe sparkles and gleams of these fine, tiny stars. It is likely that it\r\nwould have still been the tuft on the Lion's tail if a clever\r\nAlexandrian astronomer had not found it necessary to use his wits\r\nquickly and call it Berenice's Hair to please the vanity of an Egyptian\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nThe apparent center for the November meteors, or \"shooting stars,\" which\r\nappear about the 15th of the month, are within the curve of the Sickle\r\nof Leo near the star Gamma.\r\n\r\n[Figure 50]\r\nThe apparent paths of shooting stars when projected backward meet at a\r\npoint called the radiant point. It looks from the diagram as if these\r\nmeteors all came from one fixed place in the sky but the effect would\r\nalso be the same if we saw, for instance, seventeen trains racing along\r\nseventeen tracks laid parallel across a desert from a point on the\r\ndistant horizon. They would all seem to start from this point and widen\r\nout as they approached the observer, the effect in perspective, the\r\nwidening apart from a point, being the same in the case of the meteors\r\nspeeding along parallel lines in space. We see only those meteors, of\r\ncourse, which become caught and ignited in the atmosphere surrounding\r\nthe earth and which streak down the sky all aflame; the rest pass on\r\ntheir way, invisible. Of this more will be said later under the heading\r\nof \"Comets and Meteors.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Leonids,\" as these November meteors are called, are only seen in\r\nthe early morning hours on the 15th of November, while the \"Andromids,\"\r\nwhich have their radiant point in Andromeda, are only seen in the early\r\npart of the evening on the 24th of November.\r\n\r\nThe famous Leonid meteors of 1833 dropped down so fast and thick that it\r\nseemed that all the stars in the heavens were falling down on the earth.\r\nThis unique spectacle occurred again in 1866, and records show that, for\r\na thousand years back, at intervals of every 33 years, we have been\r\nvisited by such a \"star shower.\" The first disappointment came in 1899,\r\njust as the general public, probably for the first time, was looking\r\nforward to it with a great deal of pleasurable anticipation. Will we\r\nagain be disappointed in 1932? Although the earth passes across the\r\npathway of these meteors every year, it is believed that along a certain\r\nsection of the pathway the meteors are strung in thick profusion. It is\r\nthrough such a portion, literally studded with the fragments, that the\r\nearth rolls every 33 years, although it is not known for a certainty\r\nwhy, after all these years, we failed to see a display in 1899.\r\n\r\nA small \"dark\" constellation called Cancer, the Crab, lies just in front\r\nof Leo, the Lion. Although this constellation has been pointed out since\r\nvery ancient times, and holds an important position in the zodiac, it\r\ndoes not contain a single conspicuous star and could scarcely be located\r\nin the sky, were it not for a faintly shining spot of light about the\r\nsize of the Pleiades. This spot of light is a coarse cluster of 7th\r\nand 8th magnitude stars, resolvable by an opera-glass and easily located\r\nby a little star on either side. In the mythology of Greece, this\r\nconstellation represents the gigantic sea-crab which Juno sent to bite\r\nthe toes of Hercules when he was struggling in the marshes with the\r\nhundred-headed hydra. Naturally, Hercules stamped his foot down on the\r\npetty annoyance, which so offended Juno that she set the creature among\r\nthe stars.\r\n\r\nIt is the \"misty spot,\" however, that has always attracted the eyes of\r\nmen. The Chaldeans thought that the dim light came from a hole in the\r\nfloor of heaven, and that it could be no other than the \"gate of men\"\r\nthrough which souls descended into human bodies. It has also been\r\nregarded as the Manger in which Christ was born and the stars on either\r\nside were called Aselli, or Little Asses.\r\n[Figure 51]\r\nThe \"Manger\" is now known to hold 363 telescopic stars, and is\r\nhistorically interesting because it afforded one of the earliest\r\ntelescopic proofs that there were hosts of stars in the heavens besides\r\nthose visible to the unaided eye. Galileo, who first resolved its light\r\ninto stars, was able to count forty small stars in this spot, and his\r\ntelescope was no better than the field-glass of today, if we may indeed\r\nmake such a comparison.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, Præsepe, the Manger, was an infallible weather sign,\r\nfor if there was the slightest moisture in the air, its faint light was\r\ninvisible. If the moisture was not sufficient to also obscure the two\r\nstars on either side, only light showers of rain might be expected, but\r\nif the two stars were also hidden, there would be a very bad storm. If\r\nthe two stars and the Manger were all three seen clearly, one could\r\ndepend on the weather not to spoil any plans for that particular\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"When shine the Bears, and 'twixt the asses seen,\r\n    though faint, their Manger, ocean proves serene.\"\r\n\r\n                   --_Idylliums of Theocritus_ (FAWKE'S _Trans._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of Aratus, 270 B. C., this advice as to how to judge the\r\nweather by means of the tiny cloud on the back of Cancer, the Crab, was\r\ntaken so seriously that he gave it in quite extensive detail in his poem\r\n_Phenomena_:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Watch, too, the Manger. Like a faint mist in the far North it plays the\r\nguide between Cancer. Around it are borne two faintly gleaming stars,\r\nnot very far apart, nor very near but distant to the view a cubit's\r\nlength, one on the North, while the other looks toward the South. They\r\nare called the Asses and between them is the Manger. On a sudden when\r\nall the sky is clear, the Manger wholly disappears, while all the stars\r\nthat go on either side seem drawn to one another: not slight then is the\r\nstorm, with which the fields are deluged. If the Manger darken and both\r\nstars remain unaltered, they herald rain. But if the Ass to the North of\r\nthe Manger shine feebly through a faint mist, while the Southern Ass is\r\ngleaming bright, expect a wind from the South: but if in turn the\r\nSouthern Ass is cloudy and the Northern bright, watch for the North\r\nWind.\"\r\n\r\n                   --_English trans._, by G. R. MAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn English folklore, Præsepe is called the Beehive, although this name\r\nwas likely given it after telescopes were invented and it was seen that\r\nthe dim light was resolved into a multitude of little flecks, like a\r\nhive of golden bees.\r\n\r\nPræsepe passes the meridian about 9 P. M. on March 15th or 2 o'clock A.\r\nM. on the morning of January 1st. It is best seen on a clear night when\r\nthe moon is absent from the sky, and a glass of any kind will make it\r\nmore interesting.\r\n\r\nBoth the Crab and the Hydra, who also has a constellation in the sky,\r\nare quaint ways of commemorating the adventures of Hercules, but his\r\nfierce Nemean lion is the most important just at this instant, so on\r\nwith the line of floats!\r\n\r\n\r\nBERENICE'S HAIR\r\n\r\n[Figure 52]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Coma Berenices,--Berenice's Hair,--was derived from an\r\nEgyptian fable which dates back as far as the 3rd century B. C. Before\r\nthis time, the constellation was the tuft on the tail of Leo, the Lion.\r\nThus we find Præsepe, an interesting cluster of stars, just in front of\r\nLeo, and Coma Berenices, an equally interesting cluster, just behind\r\nhim. These two clusters are among the very few clusters that may be\r\nlocated with the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nComa Berenices is most clearly visible on a dark night almost overhead\r\nin the early evenings of May. With an effect like 90 minute stars\r\nscattered on velvet, these stars are quite unlike anything else in the\r\nheavens that is visible without optical aid.\r\n\r\nAstronomers have found that many of the stars in this constellation are\r\nof a delicate lilac color. These lilac stars are often the companions of\r\nother stars, forming such lovely color combinations as orange and lilac,\r\nwhite and lilac and blue and lilac, although these double stars are not\r\neasy to locate in this thick sprinkling of stars without the help of a\r\ntelescope with an equatorial mounting and graduated circles. One wonders\r\nwhat it would be like to have a lilac sun as a source of light, and what\r\nwould be the psychological reaction on generations of beings brought up\r\nunder pale lights, mauve mists and shadowy purples. There seems to be a\r\nslight difference in even the general characteristics of our earthly\r\nfolks when those who live in a land of perpetual sunshine are compared\r\nwith those who live in a city smothered in murky fogs.\r\n\r\nThe telescope has also discovered in Coma Berenices the rare sight of\r\nover 100 nebulæ drawn together in a close group. We say a \"close\r\ngroup,\" but these nebulæ only look crowded to us because they lie\r\nat such an unthinkable distance from our solar system.\r\n\r\n[Figure 53]\r\nAn ancient story, current 246 B. C., relates that this constellation was\r\nnamed after the beautiful hair of Berenice, Queen of Euergetes, one of\r\nthe Ptolemies of Egypt. The husband of this Queen had gone to Assyria on\r\na dangerous campaign and, grieving over his delay in returning, the\r\nQueen vowed to cut off her long locks of hair and consecrate it to the\r\ngods in the temple of Venus, if he might only come back to Egypt safe\r\nand victorious.\r\n\r\nNot long after this great sacrifice had been determined upon, Euergetes\r\nreturned and the Queen cut off her tresses and hung them in the temple\r\nof the goddess. But that same night the hair was stolen! Conon, the\r\nroyal astronomer of Alexandria, however, in his goodness of heart and\r\nthinking to protect the guardians of the temple from their majesties'\r\ndispleasure, stepped forward and declared that Venus had so appreciated\r\nsuch love as possessed by this faithful Queen that she had caught up the\r\nstrands of beautiful hair and laid them in the heavens.\r\n[Figure 54]\r\nAll looked toward the spot at which the astronomer pointed, and, sure\r\nenough, there lay near Leo a group of fine stars which shone like the\r\nmist on a woman's hair! Thus the guardians were saved, the husband\r\nappeased and the astounded Queen Berenice flattered and satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe Lion, Leo, however, was now obliged to change the position of his\r\ntail and instead of having it extended and brightened with this\r\nsprinkling of delicate stars, he was forced to draw it back and\r\ncurl it behind the light of Denebola, where it has since remained.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOÖTES, THE HERDSMAN\r\n\r\n[Figure 55]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brilliant golden-yellow star, Arcturus, has always been a favorite\r\namong star-gazers.\r\n[Figure 56]\r\nThis star hangs like a great globe of tinted light from the end of a\r\ncurve drawn from the Big Dipper's handle and is one of the first stars\r\nto appear during the summer evenings.\r\n\r\nTwo earthly honors have been given Arcturus which are well worth noting.\r\nIn the excess of their great admiration, the Egyptian people in ancient\r\ntimes oriented huge temples to it at the cost of tremendous labor; it\r\nwas also given special mention in the Bible.\r\n\r\nUp near the Arctic circle, this lovely star never sets, but travels in a\r\nwide circular path above the horizon. Allen remarks on its use as\r\ntimepiece for the seal-netters during the night fishing in December and\r\nJanuary. The netters judge the time by the position of the star on the\r\nfour points of the compass, in much the same manner that the Big Dipper\r\nis used for a clock as it swings around the pole. The heavens would\r\nappear rather strange to us as viewed from the far north for Polaris\r\nwould rest almost at the zenith and the Big Dipper with its handle\r\nweighted down by Arcturus, would seem to encircle the sky above the\r\nearth on an unfamiliar pathway.\r\n\r\nBoötes, the constellation in which Arcturus lies, is usually described\r\nas forming a kite-shaped figure of stars, which though faint,\r\ncovers a great deal of sky. Boötes, as mentioned before, was a herdsman\r\nwho invented the plow, and as a reward for this ingenious method of\r\ntilling the soil, was raised to a position below the stars of the Big\r\nDipper. But according to another story, Boötes represents Arcas, the\r\nson of Callisto, whom Juno so cruelly turned into a bear. In modern days\r\nthis legend seems to have been given preference for, during the\r\nseventeenth century, Helvetius invented the Hunting Dogs, the\r\nconstellation of Canes Venatici, and the huge figure of Boötes has\r\nsince been usually pictured on the star maps as holding two lively dogs\r\nin leash. These Dogs are interposed between Boötes and Ursa Major.\r\nAlthough the Hunting Dogs have no mythology, the two constellations are\r\nthus united in a common picture and Boötes and his dogs are said to be\r\nchasing the Bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Boötes leading his hunting dogs over the zenith in the leash of\r\nsidereal fire.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_CARLYLE._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ovid's version of the legend, the hunter was placed in the sky just\r\nas he was and not first metamorphosed into a bear and hung on the Pole\r\nStar as Ursa Minor. Not recognizing his mother in the form of Ursa\r\nMajor, Boötes keeps on pursuing her in an eternal chase about the Pole.\r\nHe is thus often called \"The Watcher of the Bear\" or \"The Bear Driver.\"\r\nThose who choose to consider Callisto's son, Areas, as having been\r\nmetamorphosed into a bear and hung on the pole of the heavens may then\r\nconsider Boötes as representing the herdsman who invented the plow.\r\n\r\nThe two Hunting Dogs, \"Asterion\" and \"Chara,\" now held enchained by\r\nBoötes, form the constellation Canes Venatici, which lies just below\r\nthe handle of the Big Dipper and above Arcturus and Berenice's Hair. The\r\ncollar of the hunting dog Chara is marked by the star Cor Carolli, which\r\nmeans \"Charles' Heart\" and was named in memory of Charles I by\r\nHalley, the English astronomer, on the suggestion of the Court\r\nPhysician, Sir Charles Scarborough.\r\n[Figure 57]\r\nThis star is an attractive double as viewed in a small telescope with\r\nthe delicate colorings of \"flushed white and lilac.\" On the head of\r\nAsterion lies the famous whirlpool nebula, although this may only be\r\nseen in a large telescope. This nebula has its great arms of nebulous\r\nmaterial flung widely into space and looks as if it were whirling\r\nrapidly about, but the motion, if any, is too slow for us really to see.\r\nWith a few exceptions most of the spiral nebulæ are so very distant\r\nthat they may only be seen through a very large telescope, but next to\r\nthe stars, they are the most abundant objects in all the sky and are of\r\ngreat interest to astronomers.\r\n\r\nArcturus, the beautiful first magnitude star which glows so\r\nconspicuously in the constellation of Boötes, is, however, the main\r\nsource of interest in these star groups. The star is popular for its\r\nappearance alone, for it is large and richly golden, and always easily\r\nlocated, but it is also of interest in a scientific way, for it has been\r\nfound to be an extremely huge and glorious sun. Our sun placed at the\r\nsame distance--145 millions of millions of miles--would shine as a faint\r\nand almost invisible star, yet Arcturus is so much larger than our sun\r\nthat it drifts across our sky like a bowl of light.\r\n\r\nArcturus is not only one of the largest but it is also one of the\r\nswiftest moving stars in the heavens. It moves so swiftly that it covers\r\n100 miles in every second. This speed has caused it to be labeled a\r\n\"runaway star.\" Although this star shoots through space at such an\r\nincredible rate of speed it has taken it _800 years_ to describe a space\r\n(as seen by our eyes) equal to the apparent diameter of the moon. This\r\nmay give the reader some slight realization of the vast distance which\r\nseparates us from Arcturus. But astronomers write it this way--\"It\r\nhas taken _only 800 years_ for Arcturus to describe a space equal to the\r\napparent diameter of the moon,\" for the stars are so very distant that\r\nmost of them do not seem to change their places in the heavens even in\r\nthe course of many thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAmazing as the speed of Arcturus appeared to astronomers, they later\r\ndiscovered a star of the 8th magnitude in the southern hemisphere with\r\neven a greater proper motion. This star has moved the distance of the\r\ndiameter of the moon in _220 years_, which means that it moves over a\r\nhundred times faster than the average star. But the late Professor\r\nBarnard of the Yerkes Observatory had the distinction of discovering a\r\nstar with the largest proper motion known. The average star does not\r\nexceed one minute of arc in a thousand years but Professor Barnard's\r\n\"runaway star\" has the amazing proper motion of 10.3 seconds a year. In\r\nthat length of time it travels twice as far as the average star does in\r\na century!\r\n\r\nScientists accomplish many wonderful, and most remarkable, deeds. Even\r\nthe heroes who lived in the vivid minds of the ancient peoples dwindle\r\ninto insignificance beside these men with their calm patience and\r\nbrilliant seeking minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"These mathematic men have thoughts that march\r\n    From sphere to sphere and measure out the blue\r\n    Of infinite space like roods of garden ground.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Blackie._\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Michelson has now invented a new method of measuring the\r\nangular diameter of the more distant stars. This is by means of an\r\ninstrument called the \"interferometer\" which is attached to the 100-inch\r\nreflector of the Mount Wilson Observatory. Measurements of the angular\r\ndiameter of Arcturus with the interferometer combined with the knowledge\r\nof its distance give us the astounding size of 19,000,000 miles for\r\nthe diameter of this huge sun.\r\n\r\nHenderson, in 1840, was the first astronomer to make a successful\r\nmeasurement of the distance to a star. The trigonometric method such as\r\nsurveyors use to find the distance to the far side of a river was\r\nemployed for this and with a baseline and angles he reached out and\r\ntouched the nearest stars.\r\n\r\nThe baseline of a triangle whose apex touched a star which lay millions\r\nof millions of miles away would have to be very long indeed--and a very\r\ndelicate and difficult task to handle it. Where in the world could one\r\nfind such a baseline? Certainly not on the earth! A line extending from\r\none side to the other of our earth would not even be as large as a point\r\nof light as seen from a star. Indeed when the moon was measured, and the\r\nmoon lies only 240,000 miles away, astronomers used a baseline which\r\nextended from America all the way to France. The exceedingly clever idea\r\nof taking the earth's orbit as a baseline then suggested itself, and\r\nfocussing upon a star at an interval of six months when the earth is at\r\nthe two ends of the diameter of its immense orbit around the sun.\r\n[Figure 58]\r\nThe angle between the baseline and the line of sight to the star may be\r\nnoted in the summertime, for instance, and then again in the winter. The\r\nshift of the star on the heavens caused by the observer changing his\r\nplace from one side of the sun to the other gives the parallax angle of\r\nthe star, which is the angle between the two sight lines of the observer\r\nwhere they meet at the star. If the star is distant more than 500\r\nbillion miles this shift cannot be measured with any confidence for at\r\n900 or 1000 billion miles, the star ceases to show any displacement.\r\nWhen a star is near enough to be measured by this trigonometric method\r\nit seems to describe a minute ellipse \"like a reflection of the ellipse\r\nof the earth's orbit.\" If it lies so far in space that it does not\r\nseem to change its position even when viewed from stations on either\r\nside of the earth's orbit, its distance may never be measured by using\r\nthe diameter of the earth's orbit as a baseline.\r\n\r\nEven the near stars are so very distant that their displacement is\r\nalmost imperceptible. The parallax (or the apparent angular shifting\r\ncaused by the changed position of the observer) of Alpha Centauri, our\r\nnearest star, would have, says Professor Moulton, the same difference in\r\ndirection as a point of light 11 miles from the observer viewed with one\r\neye and then the other, with the difficulties of observation extended\r\nover several months.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Arcturus. This beautiful golden star is called the\r\n\"harbinger of spring\" because it rises on the first of March just as the\r\nflowers of this season are awakening along the brooks and hillsides.\r\nWatch for it about 8 P. M. just a little north of east. At this point it\r\nis at its very best for the thickened atmosphere near the horizon fires\r\nthe orange-yellow to a molten rose, while the flickering and the dancing\r\ncauses burning waves of crimson, sparks of opal and glints of gold. It\r\nreaches the meridian June 8th about 9 P. M. but its eager, splintering\r\nlight is now calmed to a steady glow and the star hangs like a golden\r\nlamp above the world. From July to December, this splendid star floats\r\nlower and lower through the western part of the heavens until it touches\r\nthe horizon in the northwest and disappears.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN CROWN\r\n\r\n[Figure 59]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Northern Crown really looks like a crown. Its outline is easily\r\ntraced, although its stars are delicate with the exception of one\r\nwhich is much larger and brighter than the others. It closely follows\r\nArcturus and is best seen during the early evenings of July when it is\r\nfloating high in the dome of the heavens, a most fascinating star\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nLong ago, in some of the old countries, people saw in this \"Crown\" the\r\nlikeness to a broken plate held out by a beggar to receive alms; the\r\nPawnee Indians imagined it a camp circle of warriors sitting in council\r\naround their camp fire and that the bright star was a servant preparing\r\na feast over the fire; the Australian natives called it the \"boomerang,\"\r\nbut in Greek mythology this is the crown which Bacchus gave the\r\nbeautiful Ariadne after she had been deserted by Theseus, King of\r\nAthens, on the island of Naxos which lay far out to sea.\r\n\r\nAccording to a later legend, from which the Crown obtained its name, a\r\nyearly tribute of seven youths and maidens was exacted from the\r\nAthenians by the tyrant Minos, King of the Island of Crete. These\r\nAthenian captives were then rowed over from Greece to Crete and confined\r\nin a labyrinth as a feast for a ferocious Minotaur. This labyrinth had\r\nbeen constructed by Dædalus, a most ingenious artist and artificer, who\r\nhad so perfected the intricate maze of passageways that neither the\r\nMinotaur, nor any of his victims, could possibly escape.\r\n\r\nTheseus, son of Ægeus, the king of Athens, grieved deeply at the fate\r\nof so many innocent sufferers, and thinking that he might be able to\r\novercome the monster, bravely offered himself as one of the seven\r\nyouths. When Ariadne, daughter of the wicked King Minos, saw the\r\nhandsome Prince arrive among those to be sacrificed, she was filled with\r\nlove and pity and risked her own life by secretly furnishing him with a\r\nstrong sword and a long thread. Theseus then attacked the Minotaur and\r\nslew him, afterwards extricating himself from the difficult windings of\r\nthe labyrinth by means of the thread. He and Ariadne then slipped down\r\nto his vessel which had remained anchored in the harbor and set\r\nsail for Athens.\r\n\r\nOn his homeward journey the goddess Minerva appeared to Theseus and told\r\nhim that he must leave Ariadne at Naxos, an island celebrated for its\r\nvineyards, for the Fates had decreed that she should not go with him to\r\nAthens. Such barbarous conduct on the part of Theseus must have been\r\npast all understanding to poor Ariadne. Ræ has painted a very beautiful\r\npicture of her as she sits by the rocks on the sea-shore sadly gazing\r\nout to sea, for she was a very sweet girl and not at all like her wicked\r\nfather. But Theseus suffered also for his seemingly heartless desertion,\r\nfor he had promised his father, Ægeus, that if he succeeded in subduing\r\nthe Minotaur he would exchange his black sail for a white one. With one\r\nthing and another happening, Theseus forgot to change his sail, and the\r\npoor old man watching the black wing loom in the distance, supposed his\r\nson to be lost, and threw himself into the sea. This sea was henceforth\r\ncalled the Ægean Sea in memory of the tragic fate of Ægeus. In the\r\nmeantime Bacchus, the God of the Vineyards, came along decked in ivy and\r\nvine leaves, and discovered the forsaken Ariadne asleep on a rock, worn\r\nout with sorrow and weeping.\r\n[Figure 60]\r\nThe god was so captivated by the beauty of the Cretan maid that he did\r\neverything in his power to make her forget her unhappiness, even\r\nmarrying her and promising at her death to give her a place among the\r\ngods. He then suspended her wedding crown in the sky, where it still\r\nhangs, although its jewels have grown so large that they resemble stars.\r\nThese stars are now called the \"Northern Crown\" though they are really\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"A brilliant sign of the lost Ariadne.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nSpenser pointing them out in his _Faerie Queene_ says\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Look! how the crowne which Ariadne wore\r\n    Upon her ivory forehead--\r\n    --is unto the starres an ornament,\r\n    Which round her move in order excellent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAriadne's Crown rests about 20 degrees east of Arcturus and may be\r\neasily seen in the east just after sunset during the early spring, about\r\nthe 8th of April, but it is at its best during the early evenings of\r\nJuly when it is almost overhead.\r\n\r\nAlphecca, \"the bright one,\" also called \"The Pearl,\" marks the radiant\r\npoint of a shower of meteors called the Coronids. This shower occurs\r\nwhile the constellation is traveling between the east and the zenith,\r\nbeing visible from April 12th to June 20th.\r\n\r\nThe Crown remains in view from April until late October, then disappears\r\nbetween the west and northwest. It lies concealed throughout the winter,\r\nthen rises in the direct northeast in the early spring, its jewels\r\nsparkling as if they had been encased in a winter's casket of snow.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful little constellation is designated on the maps as Corona\r\nBorealis. The \"Northern Crown\" and \"Ariadne's Crown\" are only popular\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERCULES, THE GIANT\r\n\r\n[Figure 61]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn astronomical work of Eudoxus, dated about 370 B. C., but based upon\r\nobservations made probably by the Chaldeans fifteen centuries before,\r\nwas versified in a poem of 732 verses called \"Phenomena\" by Aratus, the\r\ncourt poet of Macedonia, who wrote about a century after Eudoxus' time.\r\nAratus mentions this constellation of Hercules as being of\r\nimmemorial antiquity and describes it as a figure of a man in sorrow\r\nwith his hands upraised and stretched \"one this way and one that, a\r\nfathom's length.\" In the early days of the world's history it was called\r\n\"The Kneeler\" although even this was not supposed to be its original\r\nname. Aratus says--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Right there in its orbit wheels a Phantom form, like to a man that\r\nstrives at a task. That sign no man knows how to read clearly, nor on\r\nwhat task he is bent, but simply calls him On His Knees.\"\r\n\r\n                   --_Trans. by_ G. R. MAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On His Knees\" was given the name of the hero Hercules when the Greeks\r\nplaced their heroes and divinities among the stars, but his pictures in\r\nthe modern maps do not seem to accord with the description of his\r\nposture in this ancient poem. His foot now rests upon Draco, the Sky\r\nDragon, which probably is here imagined as old Laden, the sleepless\r\ndragon which once coiled around the tree of golden apples.\r\n\r\nHercules, the great grandson of Perseus, was the greatest of all the\r\nheroes. He possessed every high quality of mind and character and was\r\nendowed with such great physical strength that his life was filled with\r\nconstant adventure. Armed with a huge club, he performed the most\r\nremarkable deeds, the most wonderful of these being his \"Twelve Labors.\"\r\nSome of these labors or adventures were so thrilling that the Greeks\r\nnamed constellations in honor of them as well as of the hero, and they\r\nhave ever since been proverbs among men. There are many allusions to\r\nthese throughout literature--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Thogh I had hadde--al the strengthe of Ercules.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_CHAUCER._\r\n\r\n\r\nLeo, who leads the zenith constellations across the sky, was the same\r\nferocious lion which Hercules encountered and killed in the valley\r\nof Nemea; he also killed the Crab now in Cancer, and the hundred-headed\r\nHydra whose constellation is seen in the south from March to June. Some\r\nwriters see in Sagitta, the Arrow; Aquila and Cygnus, the Birds; Draco,\r\nthe Dragon and other constellations, memorials of the adventures of\r\nHercules.\r\n\r\nThis huge giant gave promise of a career while very young. When no more\r\nthan eight months old, two monstrous snakes appeared and pushed their\r\nhissing heads between the bars of his cradle. Springing to his feet, he\r\nseized the reptiles by their necks, strangled them and threw them dead\r\nat the feet of his terror-stricken parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The mighty infant showed them to his sire,\r\n    And smil'd to see the wreathing snakes expire;\"\r\n\r\n                   --_Idylliums of Theocritus_ (FAWKE'S _Trans._)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Hercules grew to manhood his cousin, who ruled the Perseidæ,\r\ncommanded him to perform ten difficult tasks, which were later increased\r\nto twelve. Hercules was at first unwilling to obey but the oracle at\r\nDelphi informed him that he would become an immortal hero if he\r\nperformed the tasks, and afterwards be given a just reward. For a while\r\nHercules was so despondent that he eventually became mad, but finally\r\nthrowing off his depression, he accomplished all he set out to do with\r\nsuch cleverness and foresight and with exhibitions of such amazing\r\nstrength, that not only did the gods carry him up to Mount Olympus after\r\nhis death but gave him as a wife the lovely cupbearer, Hebe. His\r\ngigantic figure is now among the stars and many of the creatures in his\r\nadventures have been placed far above the earth in honored positions in\r\nthe heavens. Let us now go back for a moment and review some of these\r\nawe-inspiring accomplishments of Hercules.\r\n\r\nThe lion and the hydra have already been mentioned. The watersnake\r\nwas particularly difficult to kill for it possessed the distressing\r\nfaculty of being able to immediately grow two living heads in the place\r\nof each one destroyed, thus increasing not only the snake but the number\r\nof poisonous fangs. This seemingly insurmountable difficulty was finally\r\novercome when Hercules thought of searing each stump with a hot iron as\r\nsoon as it was severed, thus killing the root from which the head was\r\nborn. As seen on his constellation in the sky, this watersnake is more\r\nconspicuous for length than for his number of heads, for his faint\r\nstarry outline covers one-fourth of the southern heavens and takes four\r\nmonths in passing any one place. It was during the struggle with this\r\ncreature that Juno induced the crab to crawl out of the swamp and seize\r\nthe mighty giant's toes, afterward placing the crab on the Dark Sign,\r\nCancer, which lies just west of Leo.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh Labor of Hercules was the obtaining of the three golden\r\napples from the Garden of the Hesperides. The location of these gardens,\r\naccording to most versions of the story, was to the west of Mount Atlas\r\nwhere this most rare and delightful tree was guarded by a dragon and the\r\nfour nieces of Atlas. Atlas, who knew best where to find the apples,\r\noffered to obtain them for Hercules if he would hold up the heavens\r\nwhile he was gone. Nothing daunted Hercules, so,\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The wearied Atlas he relieved,\r\n    His arm the starry realms upheaved,\r\n    And propped the Gods above.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Euripides._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Atlas went to the garden and got the apples from his\r\nnieces. But according to another myth, Hercules went himself and stole\r\nthe apples, after slaying the dragon that guarded them. It is to be\r\nnoted that in the constellations Hercules has been placed in a decidedly\r\nuncomfortable position so that he might rest his foot upon the Sky\r\nDragon, Draco--so perhaps Draco, after all, was the monster that\r\nwas wound around that wondrous apple tree.\r\n\r\nThere is also a possibility that the sixth Labor of Hercules has been\r\nmemorialized in the sky although the weight of evidence is against it.\r\nIn his sixth Labor, Hercules destroyed the cruel carnivorous birds with\r\nthe arrows he had dipped in the blood of the poisonous hydra. These\r\nbirds, which had brazen wings, beaks and claws, hovered over the\r\nstagnant waters of Lake Stymphalus, in Arcadia, and ravaged all the\r\nsurrounding country. This praiseworthy deed may have been represented in\r\nthe sky by the \"bird\" constellations, Cygnus, Lyra and Aquila, which\r\nhover near the stream of the Milky Way, and in the little arrow Sagitta,\r\nwhich lies not far away, but it is more than likely, according to the\r\nmajority of the myths, that these constellations were named in honor of\r\nother things rather than to commemorate the deeds of Hercules.\r\n\r\nAmong other exploits which illustrate the unrivaled prowess of this\r\nhero, are his battles with giants, monsters and centaurs; catching\r\nDiana's brazen-footed stag by driving it deep into a snowdrift in the\r\ndistant northland; obtaining the girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the\r\nAmazons, in the land of women; capturing boars, bulls, mares and even\r\nbringing from the infernal regions the three-headed dog Cerberus.\r\n\r\nThe greatest demonstration of his strength, aside from the time that he\r\nupheld the heavens for Atlas, is reported by the historian Pliny.\r\nAccording to the myth which Pliny relates, Hercules had rent asunder the\r\nrocks which had previously divided the Mediterranean from the ocean;\r\nalthough another legend takes the opposite view and asserts that he had\r\nnarrowed the strait in order to exclude the sea-monsters which had\r\nhitherto forced their way in from the ocean. This gateway, known as the\r\n\"Pillars of Hercules,\" consists of two promontories which bounded the\r\nwestern horizon of the then known world. The promontory on the\r\nnorthern side of the straits is now called the \"Rock of Gibraltar.\"\r\n\r\nHercules one day donned a tunic that had been steeped in the blood of a\r\nCentaur which he had slain with a poisoned arrow. To escape the terrible\r\ntorture, he erected a funeral pyre on Mount Etna, lay down on his lion's\r\nskin and set the pyre on fire. Amid peals of thunder Jupiter descended\r\nin his chariot and carried the hero to Mount Olympus where he was given\r\nhis promised reward.\r\n\r\n   \"High o'er the hollow clouds the coursers fly,\r\n    And lodged the hero in the starry sky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs seen in the sky, Hercules kneels on Draco, the Dragon, with his head\r\nlying downward near the head of the giant Ophiuchus. These two giants\r\ncover a vast amount of sky space although neither one have very bright\r\nstars. Although Hercules rests inactive, Ophiuchus, one notes, is busily\r\nengaged, for his limbs are enfolded by the scaly body of a huge serpent\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"his right hand, its writhing tail, he grasps,\r\n    Its swelling neck, his left hand securely clasps,\r\n    The reptile rears its crested head on high\r\n    Reaching the seven-starred Crown in northern sky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime\r\n\r\n   \"His feet stamp Scorpio down, enormous beast,\r\n    Crushing the monster's eye and plated breast.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we gaze with admiration as Aratus describes this struggle which\r\nseems by all odds to be against the giant.\r\n\r\nOphiuchus perpetuates the memory of Æsculapius, father of medicine. He\r\nand his serpent, as seen in the sky, are exceedingly hard to trace but\r\nmen also sought to do him honor on earth by erecting temples in\r\nwhich he was worshiped. The brightest star in the constellation of\r\nOphiuchus, the Serpent Bearer, is Ras Alhague, although this name has\r\ngone entirely out of use and the star is generally designated as α\r\nOphiuchi.\r\n[Figure 62]\r\nThis star lies on the head of Ophiuchus which is about three-quarters of\r\nthe way up from the horizon to the zenith, when on the meridian. It\r\nrises a little north of east, appearing When the sun sets on the 14th of\r\nMay, and requiring 6 hours and 46 minutes to reach the line midway\r\nbetween east and west. Ras Algethi (α Herculis), a beautiful orange\r\ncolored star on the head of Hercules, is usually noted in connection\r\nwith Ras Alhague, since they stand rather isolated only about 6 degrees\r\napart. (The distance between the \"Pointers\" on the outer side of the Big\r\nDipper is equal to 5 degrees.) When Ras Algethi and Ras Alhague are near\r\nthe meridian, a glance of the eye beyond will meet two stars of the 2nd\r\nmagnitude also not far apart. These are \"The Dragon's Eyes,\" Alwaid and\r\nEtanin. Recalling that Hercules has his foot on the Dragon's head, that\r\nthe head stars of the two giants' lie almost together, and the feet of\r\nthe lower giant, Ophiuchus, are crushing down Scorpio, the Scorpion (a\r\nconspicuous anchor shaped constellation in the south), one has a fairly\r\ngood idea of this section of the sky from the Pole Star to the horizon,\r\nwhen Ras Alhague and Ras Algethi are near the meridian. Since both\r\nHercules and Ophiuchus have very large but also very inconspicuous\r\nconstellations, it is well to keep them connected in some such manner.\r\n\r\nIn modern days the constellation of Hercules has gained in interest\r\nthrough observations made by the telescope. Unfortunately the ancients\r\nwere not privileged to see its gayly colored double stars and its\r\nmarvelously beautiful star cluster.\r\n[Figure 63]\r\nAmong the double stars, Young mentions an orange and blue, and a white\r\nand emerald green; the Rev. T. W. Webb points out one almost\r\nappetizingly attractive in its light apple green and cherry red while\r\nServiss notes some charming combinations--orange and green, pale green\r\nand purple, light yellow and pale red--which may be seen with such\r\nmeager assistance as an opera-glass. Serviss, by the way, has written a\r\nwhole book on what may be seen in the sky with no greater aid than an\r\nopera-glass.\r\n\r\nThe star cluster in Hercules lies on the west side of the constellation,\r\nabout one-third of the distance from the north end and not far from the\r\nfigure of the Northern Crown. To the unaided eye, this cluster looks no\r\nmore than a glimmering speck of light, but if a powerful telescope is\r\ntrained upon it, it is resolved into a great cluster of stars. These\r\nstars, numbering into the thousands, are so packed together toward the\r\ncenter that they have been described as resembling \"ice crystals in a\r\nsnowball.\" From such a lovely blaze within the center another observer\r\nadds that \"sprays of stars reach out in all directions like tendrils of\r\na vine.\"\r\n\r\nThe stars counted on a photograph of the Hercules cluster which was\r\ntaken by the great 60-inch reflector on Mount Wilson, number over\r\n50,000! This telescope resolves even the solid glow of light at the\r\ncenter of the cluster into individual stars.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Ball in \"Star-land\" gives a good illustration of the\r\nappearance of a globular cluster of stars as seen in a large telescope.\r\n\"I take a pepper-castor and on a sheet of white paper I begin to\r\nshake out pepper until there is a little heap in the center and the\r\nother grains of pepper are scattered loosely about. Imagine that every\r\none of those grains of pepper was to be transformed into a tiny electric\r\nlight, and then you would have some idea of what a cluster of stars\r\nwould look like when viewed through a telescope of sufficient power.\"\r\n\r\n[Figure 64: A STAR CLUSTER IN HERCULES.\r\nPhotograph by Yerkes Observatory through 24-inch telescope. A photograph\r\nof the same star-cluster by the Mount Wilson Observatory through a\r\n60-inch reflecting telescope is shown on page 2.]\r\n\r\nIt was at one time thought that the cluster of Hercules might be a\r\ncomparatively close cluster of small-sized suns, but Professor Shapley\r\nhas lately discovered that the cluster is a very distant one; indeed it\r\nlies at such an exceedingly remote position in the realms of space that\r\nits parallax is slightly inferior to a 10,000th second of arc which\r\ncorresponds to a little more than 36,000 light years. Thus it takes\r\n36,000 light years for its light to reach us, for this light has to\r\ncross the unthinkable space of 220,000 billion miles!\r\n\r\n\r\nLYRA, THE HARP\r\n\r\n[Figure 65]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the string of constellations twinkling high overhead during the\r\nspring and summer months, we have already mentioned Leo, the Lion;\r\nBerenice's Hair; Boötes with his golden Arcturus; the Northern Crown\r\nand the giant Hercules.\r\n\r\nNext to Hercules, on the east, lies the constellation of Lyra,\r\nrepresented in legend as the sweet toned harp which belonged to Orpheus,\r\nson of the Muse Calliope. Orpheus inherited the love of music from his\r\nmother, and after the Sun-god had presented him with this wonderful\r\nharp, he played so delightfully that even trees, rocks and hills\r\ngathered around him to listen.\r\n\r\nTreasuring the memory of such remarkable talents, the Greeks placed the\r\ninstrument in the heavens at the edge of the Milky Way, where its\r\nframework was adorned by a group of stars, one of which is exceptionally\r\nbright, vividly blue and very beautiful. This blue star is called the\r\n\"Harp Star,\" or Vega, by astronomers.\r\n\r\n[Figure 66: Precessional Orbit of the Pole.]\r\n\r\nVega rises in the far northeast in the early evenings during the first\r\nof May but during July and August it passes almost overhead. When near\r\nthe rim of the northern horizon yellow and red fires dart out amidst the\r\nblue, but when high above in the dome of the sky, its color is pure and\r\ncoldly blue, a decided contrast to the golden warmth of Arcturus, which\r\nlies not far to the west of it.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the precession of the equinoxes, in less than 12,000\r\nyears Vega will be the nearest bright star to the pole; indeed it\r\nwill be close enough to serve as our North Star. Then, instead of\r\nwandering from the far northeast to the far northwest, it will seem to\r\nstand in the north like a pale-blue pivot, while all the other stars\r\nwill circle round it. Vega will hold this position for 3000 years. The\r\nconstellation of Lyra and that of Hercules are of particular interest\r\nbecause they mark that part of the universe to which our sun is\r\ntraveling at the rate of 12½ miles a second. Some day (in half a\r\nmillion years or so), this gorgeous sun, a hundred times more brilliant\r\nthan our sun, may glow upon us as a near neighbor. In 12,000 years, when\r\nour north pole points to Vega, the great Cross with its bright stars\r\nDeneb and Albireo, will never set but will journey night after night in\r\na small circle close about the celestial pole, Orion will climb over the\r\nzenith and the Milky Way in all its splendor will whirl about the north.\r\n\r\nThe principal figure formed by the stars of the constellation of Lyra\r\nhas been best described as an \"equilateral triangle balanced on the\r\ncorner of a rhomboid.\" This figure is easily traced although all of\r\nthese stars, with the exception of the brilliant blue one, are of no\r\nmore than the 3rd or 4th magnitude.\r\n\r\nTo the average eye, the little star east of Vega, at the top of the\r\ntriangle, appears a trifle elongated, but a sharp eye divides the star\r\ninto two stars set very closely together. With a 3-inch telescope each\r\nof these stars is found to be double. This fourfold star in Lyra is\r\nsometimes referred to as a \"double-double.\"\r\n\r\n[Figure 67]\r\nThe third star, Lyræ, at the base of the \"rhomboid\" on the same side of\r\nthe figure as Vega, is a variable with three small stars near it,\r\nforming a very pretty object with low power.\r\n\r\nAlso at the base of the rhomboid, between β and γ, one-third of the\r\nway from β, a small telescope will disclose a nebula which has assumed\r\nthe shape of a ring, or at least it looks like a ring at this distance.\r\nThere are various types of nebulæ, some, like the \"planetary\" and\r\n\"spiral,\" having definite forms, others being as shapeless as a puff of\r\nvapor. Sometimes a planetary nebula has a star at its center, and again\r\nit appears hollow, like \"a little smoke ring.\" It is then called a ring\r\nnebula. The most famous of these is the one found in Lyra.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th and 20th of April swift meteors, known as the Lyrids,\r\nradiate from the vicinity of this constellation, although the display is\r\nof interest rather than of any particular beauty.\r\n\r\nThe legend of this celestial harp, which is often hung by map artists\r\naround the neck of an eagle, is one of the most popular stories in\r\nmythology, and its very appearance in the heavens brings to mind the\r\nbeautiful lovers, Orpheus and Eurydice. The harp was anciently\r\nrepresented as having been invented by Mercury, who gave it to his\r\nhalf-brother Apollo, the Sun-god, who later presented it to Orpheus, the\r\nson of a Muse.\r\n\r\nMercury, as an infant, gave promise of being a most remarkable god, for\r\nthe very day that he was born, he climbed out of his cradle, wandered\r\nout of the lofty cavern of Cyllene and picked up a little tortoise that\r\nwas crawling past the entrance. Gently pulling off the scoop-shaped\r\nshell, he bored neat holes along its edges, stretched dried tendons\r\nacross its face, and wedged it firmly between two horns. His tiny hands\r\nthen strayed across the strings, and he danced delightedly as the most\r\ndelicious music issued from the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \"And this, whilst yet\r\n    Encradled, Hermes pierced and called it Lyre.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nMercury then went in and slept awhile, but when darkness came, he again\r\nslipped out of his cavern and ran over to the hillside to see what\r\nfurther adventure awaited him. Here he found the pasture of Apollo's\r\ncows, and looking the animals over, separated fifty of the best from the\r\nherd, wrapped their hoofs in branches and drove them backwards into a\r\nlarge cave where he made a fire and sacrificed two of them to the twelve\r\nGods (himself included).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 68: THE RING NEBULA IN LYRA.\r\nPhotograph by Mount Wilson Observatory through the 100-inch Hooker\r\ntelescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day while Apollo was driving his sun-chariot over the slopes in\r\nthe east, he noticed that a number of his favorite cows were missing.\r\nInvestigating the matter, he traced the theft to this baby, who stood up\r\nin his cradle, looked the Sun-god in the face, and stoutly denied it; he\r\neven inquired in a naïve manner what sort of animals cows were. Too\r\namazed for further words, Apollo picked him up, tucked him under his\r\narm, and went straightway up Mount Olympus to Jupiter. Here the infant\r\nstood bravely in the midst of the assembly in the great Olympian Hall\r\nand with a look of injured innocence upon his face inquired, \"How could\r\nI, still wrapped in swaddling clothes, drive away Apollo's herd? You\r\nwell know that I was only born yesterday and have never crossed my\r\nmother's threshold.\" The gods, perfectly aware of his guilt, roared with\r\nlaughter and loudly applauded. Even Jupiter smiled at the infant's\r\ncleverness and, presenting him with a winged silver cap and silver wings\r\nfor his feet, told him to lead Apollo to the cave where he had driven\r\nthe cattle. Seeing that further subterfuge was useless, Mercury laughed\r\ngleefully and handed Apollo his harp as a peace offering.\r\n\r\nApollo soon played divinely on the little harp and was altogether so\r\npleased with the instrument that he gave Mercury entire charge of his\r\nflocks and herds, as he preferred to become famous as the God of Music.\r\nThe Sun-god later gave the harp to Orpheus, and because a god had played\r\nupon it, it responded to the touch of this beautiful youth in tones so\r\npure and joyous that even wild beasts were charmed, while birds swarmed\r\nabout him in the air and sea-monsters came up to hear him from the\r\nbottom of the sea. The power of his music was so great that rushing\r\ntorrents slacked their rapid course to listen to him, and once,\r\nwhile playing, he watched amazed as a whole forest marched up to a level\r\nplace on a hill where it made a shade for a large assemblage of wild\r\nanimals and the multitudes of birds who sat as if enchanted while he\r\nplayed.\r\n\r\nThis gay and happy musician had a lovely bride named Eurydice, daughter\r\nof the Sea-god Nereus, whom he fondly loved. One day while wandering in\r\nthe fields, Eurydice was fatally bitten by a viper which lay concealed\r\nin the long grass. Orpheus filled the groves and valleys with his\r\npiteous lamentations and finally, unable to live without her any longer,\r\nhe boldly walked into the cave that led to Pluto's realm, and braved the\r\nhorrors of the steep, dark path which led to the lower world. After a\r\ndifficult journey he arrived among the Shades, and wandered playing and\r\nsinging among the admiring throng. The ancients claim that the power of\r\nhis music arrested for a while the torments of the damned, that his\r\n\"golden tones\" seemed so heavenly in these gloomy depths that the stone\r\nof Sisyphus remained motionless, the Danaides stopped their wearisome\r\ntask of pouring water through a sieve, and the Furies withheld their\r\npersecutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"E'en Tantalus ceased from trying to sip\r\n    The cup that flies from his arid lip.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Saxe._\r\n\r\n\r\nPluto was touched to unheard of softness and, as he granted Orpheus'\r\nplea that Eurydice be returned to him, \"iron tears\" rolled down the\r\nfurrows of his cheeks. \"But hold,\" said the crafty monarch, \"there is\r\none condition. If you once glance behind you to see if Eurydice is\r\nfollowing, you must lose her again forever.\" Crashing chords of joyous\r\ntriumph, Orpheus hurried up the rough pathway that led to the top of the\r\nworld, but as he was about to pass the extreme limits of Hades and saw\r\nbeyond him the opening where the sunlight reached in gently through the\r\ndarkness, he grew afraid, and in order to convince himself that\r\nhis beloved wife was really behind him, he turned suddenly around--only\r\nto see Eurydice, with her arms outstretched, floating slowly backwards\r\ninto the drear, dead land below. The grief of Orpheus at this second\r\nloss was even more intense than before, and half-crazed with sorrow and\r\nremorse, the poor lad stumbled to the banks of the river Strymon, where\r\nhe mourned for seven days with neither food nor drink. At last he\r\nwandered up into the mountains where he fell into the hands of wild,\r\nbacchanalian revelers and came to a violent end. At the intercession of\r\nApollo and the Muses, the harp of Orpheus was placed among the stars\r\nwhile the youth himself was tenderly cared for and buried beneath the\r\nshadow of Mount Olympus.\r\n\r\n[Figure 69]\r\n\r\nSome mythologists, however, claim that Orpheus was changed into a swan\r\nand placed in the heavens as the constellation of Cygnus so that he\r\nmight be near Lyra, the constellation of the Harp, although the Latin\r\npoet Ovid claims that \"Cygnus\" took its name from \"Cycnus,\" a friend of\r\nApollo's son Phæthon. It might seem strange, on the face of it, that a\r\ncelebrated singer like Orpheus should be changed into a bird as lacking\r\nin song as the swan, but it should be remembered that the ancients\r\nbelieved that a dying swan sang very sweetly. At least we are\r\nquite certain that Lyra is the harp that Mercury invented, that the\r\nSun-god endowed with a golden tone, and that Orpheus played upon when he\r\nheld spellbound not only mankind, but beasts, rocks and trees.\r\n\r\nThis great Harp floats across the dome of the heavens on summer evenings\r\nwith the blue jewel Vega blazing on its frame. Longfellow in \"The\r\nOccultation of Orion\" clearly visioned\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"its celestial keys,\r\n    Its chords of air, its frets of fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine that these twinkling chords still sigh and give\r\nforth strains of music, for an Æolian Harp is a harp that sings when a\r\nwind passes over its strings, and the music of such an instrument is of\r\na drowsy, lulling quality which blends beautifully into dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NORTHERN CROSS\r\n\r\n[Figure 70]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust east of the Harp Star, in the center of the Milky Way, rests a\r\ncross of stars, clear and bright, as if a cross had really been placed\r\nthere and then studded with five big stars.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May the Cross rises on its side (as viewed by an\r\nobserver in the northern hemisphere), but it rests north and south as it\r\nreaches the zenith in midsummer. By December it has reached the slope in\r\nthe west, and now assuming an upright position, descends majestically to\r\nthe horizon. This descent is quite effective, especially at the moment\r\nwhen the pale orange star, which rests at its base, lightly touches a\r\nmountain range etched in the distance or the edge of a far-reaching\r\nplain. This 3rd magnitude star, Albireo, is a favorite with\r\namateur astronomers, for it has a 5th magnitude companion star of the\r\nrichest and most vivid greenish-blue.\r\n[Figure 71]\r\nThis lovely double star with its sharply contrasted colors may be seen\r\nto good advantage in a small telescope and vies in beauty with the\r\nfamous three-colored star, Gamma Andromedæ.\r\n\r\nDeneb, the brilliant white star at the head of the Cross, is a very\r\ndistant sun but is so large that it shines forth brightly among our\r\nfinest stars. It is estimated by astronomers as being at a much greater\r\ndistance than the Harp Star, Vega, and Vega is distant about 232\r\nmillions of millions of miles!\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the huge sun that Deneb must be to shine so brightly at\r\nits great distance, there is a little star above the armpiece on the\r\neastern side of the Cross, which is the nearest star to the earth that\r\nhas yet been found, as seen from the northern hemisphere.\r\n[Figure 72]\r\nThis faint star is really a very tiny sun for nine more similar suns\r\nthrown into it and blazing as one big fire, would no more than equal our\r\nsun in brilliancy.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of 61 Cygni, is a large, mysterious, black spot visible\r\non account of the glow of light from the densely packed stars of the\r\nMilky Way. This spot was first described as being \"like a hole\" and was\r\ncuriously named \"A Sack of Coals.\" Science later suggested that since we\r\nhave dark suns perhaps we also have dark nebulæ and that such an object\r\nmay be lying between us and those distant stars. The late E. E. Barnard\r\nof Yerkes Observatory made extensive studies of the distribution of\r\nnebular matter and he seems to have definitely proved the existence of\r\n\"dark nebulæ.\" The black spots and \"rifts\" in the Milky Way are now\r\ngenerally accepted to be dark nebulous matter which cuts out the light\r\nfrom the stellar regions behind them. Professor Barnard made many\r\nwonderful photographs of such dark spots and compiled a famous Catalogue\r\nof 182 Dark Markings in the sky. Dr. Hubble of the Mount Wilson\r\nObservatory found that in its normal state a nebula is dark rather than\r\nluminous. If a nebula shines it is because it is either illuminated by\r\nthe light from the stars near it or because it is electrically excited\r\nin some way not clearly understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 73: A DARK NEBULA (S-SHAPED) IN OPHIUCHUS.\r\nPhotograph by Mount Wilson Observatory through the 100-inch\r\nHooker telescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a Cross on the Milky Way with a dark nebula beside it in a\r\nconspicuous position in the southern hemisphere, although there the\r\ncross is not quite as perfect as our cross in the north, for it is\r\nformed of only four bright stars instead of five. Even our cross is not\r\nquite perfect, for one star, the \"diamond-studded nail\" holding it\r\ntogether, is just a little out of line. Julia E. Rogers in \"Earth and\r\nSky\" has said that her fingers fairly \"itch to put it where it belongs.\"\r\nImagine! And since she has so aptly expressed it, we now all feel that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThis outlined figure of the great Northern Cross forms the basis of a\r\nconstellation called Cygnus, the Swan.\r\n[Figure 74]\r\nThe bill of the Swan lies on Albireo, the double star at the foot of the\r\nCross, while its wings curve gracefully back from the armpiece.\r\n\r\nAccording to the story of Phæthon and Cycnus, Phæthon, after his\r\nhectic ride in the sun-chariot, fell a \"charred fragment\" into the river\r\nEridanus. Jupiter's thunderbolt had hit its mark:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"And Phæthon caught in mid-career,\r\n    And hurled from sun to utter sunlessness,\r\n    Like a flame-bearded comet, with ghastliest hiss,\r\n    Fell headlong in the amazed Eridanus.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Worsley._\r\n\r\n\r\nPhæthon's three sisters, the Heliades, wept so bitterly on the banks of\r\nthe Eridanus that the compassionate gods changed them into poplar trees\r\nand their tears into amber. Ovid pictures their terrible grief--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"All the night long their mournful watch they keep,\r\n    And all the day stand round the tomb and weep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCycnus, Phæthon's friend, also grieved deeply and watched over the\r\nwaters for many days. While watching thus his neck grew longer and\r\nlonger until at last it became perfectly atrocious. The gods again\r\nlooked down in pity, metamorphosed the youth into a swan and placed him\r\non the river of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"For Cycnus loved unhappy Phæthon,\r\n    And sung his loss in poplar groves alone,\r\n    Beneath the sister shades to soothe his grief,\r\n    Heaven heard his song and hastened his relief.\r\n    And changed to snowy plumes his hoary hair,\r\n    And winged his flight to sing aloft in air.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Virgil._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this swan is really Cycnus it seems strange that he was not depicted\r\nas flying down the wavy line of Eridanus' stars instead of being placed\r\nover the silvery stream of the Milky Way, for the river Eridanus,\r\ninto which Phæthon had fallen, was placed in the winter sky at the foot\r\nof Orion. This was supposed to console Apollo for the loss of his son.\r\nPerhaps the Swan is Orpheus, as some mythologists claim, carried up to\r\nthe constellations to be near his well-loved harp. However, no matter\r\nwhich 'human' this long-necked bird is supposed to represent, we see its\r\ngigantic, graceful outlines sketched with star-like lightness beyond the\r\nstars of the Cross, and we see his snow-white wings extended and the\r\norange light of Albireo shining on his beak, as he flies softly, head\r\ndownward, along the misty river of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 75: THE ZENITH CONSTELLATIONS AND THE SPECTATORS OF THE\r\nPAGEANT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTATORS OF THE ZENITH PAGEANT\r\n\r\n\r\n    AQUILA, _the Eagle_.           SAGITTARIUS, _the Archer_.\r\n    DELPHINUS, _the Dolphin_.      HYDRA, the _Water-snake_.\r\n    AURIGA, _the Charioteer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE above constellations, which lie to either side of the great summer\r\nparade of star-figures which crosses the heavenly dome, will be called,\r\nfor convenience in locating them, \"the spectators.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the \"spectator\" Ophiuchus, who is grasping Serpens (which\r\nis a separate constellation but usually mentioned in conjunction with\r\nOphiuchus), has already been mentioned under the adventures of the giant\r\nHercules, and that of Crater, the Cup and of Corvus, the Crow, will\r\nappear in connection with the Water-snake. The four large stars in the\r\nsouthern part of the sky--Spica, Antares, Formalhaut and Sirius--are,\r\nhowever, better taken in a group by themselves, for they are thus more\r\neasily remembered as large stars conspicuous in different seasons of the\r\nyear in a region where large stars are scarce.\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUILA, THE EAGLE\r\n\r\n[Figure 76]\r\n\r\n\r\nAquila, the Eagle, was given a constellation not far below the\r\nCross, at the edge of the Milky Way. This Eagle is designated\r\nas the Flying Eagle so as not to be confused with the Eagle which\r\nholds Lyra, the Harp. In mythology the eagle was supposed to\r\nbe the bird of Jupiter because it could fly higher than other birds.\r\nThis particular eagle stood by the throne in the palace on Mount\r\nOlympus and carried the thunderbolts in his claws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He, a bird, supplies the heavens with sacred bolts and arms the skies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eagle pictured on the star maps is a very large bird, but the only\r\nportion of him not difficult to locate in the sky are the three bright\r\nstars which hang like a bar across his neck.\r\n[Figure 77]\r\nThese stars alone suggest a bird flying with outstretched wings. This is\r\na region of birds, for the great Cross with Cygnus, the Swan, drifts\r\ndown the Milky Way between the two Eagles. The \"three birds\" are most\r\neffective and easily located when seen on the meridian in midsummer, for\r\nthey then form a large triangle across the star stream, Lyra and Aquila\r\nbeing at the edges of the stream and at the base of the triangle with\r\nthe center of the Cross at its peak.\r\n\r\nOne day Jupiter sent this eagle who is now in the sky down from Mount\r\nOlympus to seize a beautiful youth named Ganymede who was tending his\r\nfather's flocks on Mount Ida. This youth was then carried up to the\r\npalaces of the Gods and given the position of cupbearer. The Greeks\r\nbelieved that Jupiter gave Ganymede's grieving father a pair of divine\r\nhorses as a compensation for kidnaping his boy and comforted him at the\r\nsame time by saying that Ganymede had now become immortal and free from\r\nall earthly ills. The eagle was rewarded for its daring by being placed\r\namong the constellations. Ganymede was also, in due time, honored in the\r\nsame manner and is represented by the constellation Aquarius, the\r\nWaterbearer, despite the fact that it was nectar, and not water, that\r\nthis youth poured in the cups of the gods. Aquarius lies east of Aquila.\r\n\r\nThe large white star in the center of the three stars which hang\r\non the neck of the Eagle is called Altair. Altair rises a little north\r\nof east with its twin stars Alshain and Trazed, about 9 o'clock on the\r\n29th of May. It arrives at the meridian at 10 o'clock August 18th, at 9\r\no'clock September 2nd, and at 8 o'clock September 18th.\r\n[Figure 78]\r\nIt is then about two-thirds of the way up from the horizon. The three\r\nstars are called \"The Shaft of Altair.\" Altair is one of the nearest of\r\nthe brightest stars and is approaching the earth at the rate of 20 miles\r\na second. You may step out now and look up at this star with a personal\r\ninterest, but it is still far away. Indeed it is so very far away that\r\ngenerations will live and die and still an increase in its light will\r\nscarcely be noticeable.\r\n\r\nA small arrow studded with five stars lies, pointing east, in the Milky\r\nWay, slightly to the north of Altair. These stars lie in the\r\nconstellation of Sagitta, the Arrow, which the Greeks may have\r\nconsidered an arrow of Hercules aimed at one of the bird constellations,\r\nor the arrow with which the hero slew the vulture which tormented\r\nPrometheus on the top of the Caucasus mountains. It is sometimes also\r\ncalled \"Cupid's Arrow.\" Sagitta is one of the oldest of the\r\nconstellations, its history being lost even in the time of Aratus.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELPHINUS, THE DOLPHIN\r\n\r\n[Figure 79]\r\n\r\n\r\nDelphinus, the Dolphin, may be located 10 degrees to the northeast of\r\nAquila, the Eagle, and below and to the east of Cygnus, on the Milky\r\nWay. It is popularly known as \"Job's Coffin,\" which, ridiculous or not,\r\nis said to have originated from the \"diamond-shaped\" form in which its\r\nstars are set. This conception, however, places less strain on the\r\nimagination than in the case of Pegasus (whose nose starred by Enif lies\r\n10 degrees southeast of Delphinus), where the four principal stars form\r\na \"square\" and are called a \"Flying Horse.\" But the name of Job's\r\nCoffin, as mentioned before, is merely a popular name while Delphinus,\r\nthe constellation known as the Dolphin, was named in honor of a dolphin\r\nconnected with the adventures of Arion, far-famed as a musician of\r\nCorinth about 700 B. C.\r\n\r\nThe dolphin which the map-makers drew on the star-maps is an exceedingly\r\nplump and queer-looking animal. As Admiral Smith comically remarks, it\r\nlooks more \"like a huge periwinkle pulled out of its shell.\" In reality\r\ndolphins are anything but periwinklian, for they belong to the whale\r\nfamily. They grow to be from six to eight feet in length and travel in\r\nherds, and have been seen by the writer gamboling and playing on the\r\nsurface of the sea in the most remarkable manner. They are supposed to\r\nbe strongly attracted toward harmonious sounds such as music, delight in\r\nracing with passing ships and seem to be of an exceptionally friendly\r\nnature toward man. On this foundation was based the legend of Arion,\r\nfirst given by Herodotus and afterwards decorated by the poets.\r\n\r\nArion had been sent by Periander, ruler of Corinth, to Sicily and Italy,\r\nand at Tarentum had won the prize in a musical contest. As he returned\r\nladen with gifts in a Corinthian ship, the musician was attacked by\r\navaricious sailors determined to do away with him and take possession of\r\nhis goods. Warned by Apollo in a dream, Arion lured close a troop of\r\nfriendly dolphins by the sweet strains of his cithara. Leaping to the\r\nback of an admiring one, he was carried to the promontory of Tænarus,\r\nwhere he landed and journeyed on to Corinth. For this praiseworthy deed,\r\nthe gods raised the dolphin among the constellations.\r\n\r\nAnother legend tells us that when Neptune, Ruler of the Sea,\r\ncourted the lovely, dark-eyed nymph Amphitrite, he came riding on the\r\nback of a dolphin.\r\n[Figure 80]\r\nAs his courtship was successful, he rewarded the dolphin in the usual\r\nway, by gaining permission to have him placed among the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGITTARIUS, THE ARCHER\r\n\r\n[Figure 81]\r\n\r\n\r\nSagittarius, the Archer, is supposed to be a centaur, one of a fabulous\r\nrace seen on the plains of Thessaly and about the woods of Mount Pelion.\r\nThis race was supposed to possess the body of a horse and the head and\r\nshoulders of a man but none of them had ever amounted to much or\r\naccomplished anything of worth in the world, with the grand exception of\r\none centaur, whose name was Chiron. Chiron lived in a stone cave near\r\nthe summit of Mount Pelion and it was here that all the heroes of\r\nGreece--Hercules, Jason, Castor and Pollux, Aesculapius, Achilles and\r\nothers--spent their early lives, for Chiron was famous for his knowledge\r\nand served these young men as a tutor. He not only taught them all the\r\nmanly arts but he aided them in various enterprising adventures, such as\r\nmarking out the constellations for the heroes when they went with Jason\r\nin the Argo in search of the Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\nOne day Hercules unfortunately opened the fatal wine-jar, and the odor,\r\nfloating about on the breezes, attracted hordes of common centaurs\r\nwho fought ferociously to gain possession of it. Hercules managed to\r\nkill most of them with the arrows he had dipped in the blood of the\r\npoisonous hydra, but his old master was also accidentally wounded by one\r\nof the terrible barbs. Any wound, however slight, inoculated with this\r\npoison, was certain to prove fatal, but the centaur Chiron was immortal\r\nand could not die. Retiring to his cave, he prayed to the gods to\r\ndeprive him of his immortality so that he might be released from his\r\nsuffering, and to accept him as an atonement for Prometheus, the\r\ngigantic Titan \"Forethought,\" who wished for immortality so that he\r\nmight always be an aid to man. This Titan, in his eagerness to aid\r\nmankind, had once displeased the gods by secretly climbing up to heaven,\r\nlighting a reed at the fire of the sun, and bringing down the holy flame\r\nas a gift to the human race. He thus was the founder of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Resentment stung the Thunderer's inmost soul,\r\n    And his heart chafed in anger, when he saw\r\n    The fire far-gleaming in the midst of man.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Hesiod._\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only did Jupiter punish the Titan by chaining him to a crag in the\r\nCaucasus mountains at the eastern end of the earth, but he sent Pandora\r\nto the Titan's brother Epimetheus, and Pandora, through her unrestrained\r\ncuriosity, opened a forbidden box and let out all the woes and sorrows\r\nwhich now roam the world. Since, however, ungrateful mankind had\r\ninformed on Prometheus, he rewarded them with a remedy for old\r\nage--which was slyly stolen by a snake as the gift was being conveyed\r\ndown the mountain. Thus snakes renew their youth by casting off their\r\nskins while men suffer helplessly with all the evils that prey upon the\r\nold. But Jupiter now felt such great pity for Chiron in his torture that\r\nhe somewhat forgot his indignation at Prometheus (and anyway\r\nmortals had been using fire for many generations and it had spread to\r\nsuch an extent that it was now past regaining), so the great god granted\r\nChiron's prayer that he might sacrifice his immortality for the release\r\nof Prometheus.\r\n\r\n[Figure 82: The Bow, the Scorpion and the Hydra's Tail.]\r\n\r\nHercules then made his way up the precipice where Prometheus was bound,\r\nkilled the vulture which was torturing him, struck off his chains and\r\nset him free. The centaur was then made mortal, released from his\r\nsufferings by the gentle balm of death, placed in the heavens and\r\nbeautified with stars.\r\n\r\nThis centaur, now called Sagittarius, the Archer, was given a\r\nconstellation near the southern horizon, indeed, he lies so far to the\r\nsouth that he is partially hidden from view and only the head and bow\r\nand arrow may be seen by most of us living in the United States. His\r\nconstellation may be easily located by first finding the Scorpion, which\r\nhas a large, well-defined anchor-shaped figure marked in the center by a\r\nbrilliantly red first magnitude star.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks imagined that the Arrow of the Archer was drawn and held\r\nagainst the bow. Ovid says that the Archer \"Thrusts the Scorpion with\r\nhis bended bow.\"\r\n[Figure 83]\r\nHowever, most of the people in these United States call the Bow and\r\nArrow a \"Milk Dipper\" because its stars seem to outline a little Dipper\r\nembedded in the stream of the Milky Way.\r\n[Figure 84]\r\nThus we have fancy adorned and plain fancy. The arrow, the stars in the\r\nbow and two other stars form this little Dipper which is best seen\r\ndirectly in the south, near the horizon, on September first at 8\r\nP. M. Sagittarius is low in the south at the same time that Vega is on\r\nthe meridian.\r\n\r\nIn the star-maps, the Centaur is shown halting at the edge of the star\r\nstream and aiming across its mist of light at the great red star which\r\nflutters on the heart of the Scorpion. The Scorpion, however, is\r\npictured as observing with interest the nearby tail of the many-headed\r\nwatersnake although he is almost crushed by the mighty foot of the giant\r\nOphiuchus whose head lies high up in the sky against that of Hercules.\r\nThe Centaur's group of stars, the constellation of Sagittarius, is a\r\nzodiacal constellation, with the arrow and part of the bow for its\r\nsymbol. ♐︎\r\n\r\nThere is also another centaur in the sky but no part of him can\r\nbe seen in these latitudes. This constellation contains two famous\r\nstars, Alpha and Beta Centauri, sometimes called the \"Southern Pointers\"\r\nbecause they point to the figure of the Southern Cross.\r\n[Figure 85]\r\nThese two stars are on the Centaur's forefeet. Alpha Centauri is the\r\nnearest star to the earth, lying at a distance of only\r\n25,000,000,000,000 miles. Unthinkable as this number of miles may seem,\r\nit is such a short distance across the fields of the heavens that Alpha\r\nCentauri and our sun would appear to be very close together as seen from\r\nthe planets of other stars. Thus our kingdom of the sun is not an\r\nisolated isle among the dim star-lights of space, but shines as one of\r\nthe stars in a community of such kingdoms. The tiny star 61 Cygni is the\r\nnearest star to the earth as seen from the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRA, THE WATER-SNAKE\r\n\r\n[Figure 86]\r\n\r\n\r\nHydra, the Water-snake, first rears a venomous head above the eastern\r\nhorizon on January 5th about 9 P. M. He slowly squirms along the\r\nsouthern horizon, his length being so appalling that it takes him four\r\nmonths to completely pass any one point in the sky.\r\n\r\nAlong the body of this Water-snake are scattered a few 4th magnitude\r\nstars. The twinkling lights of these stars may be followed far to the\r\nsouth and then east, almost to the boundary of Scorpio. Indeed, when the\r\nWatersnake is completely above the horizon, as he is in April, these\r\nstars show that his long length stretches over nearly a quarter of the\r\nsky! Some poets state that this creature had one hundred heads, others\r\nclaim that he had only nine. However this may be, there is only one that\r\nis easily traced and this lies, triangle-shaped, just below Leo, the\r\nLion.\r\n\r\nThe only noticeably bright marking on the Water-snake is the orange-hued\r\nstar of the second magnitude which lies upon the reptile's heart. This\r\nstar is called Cor Hydræ after its location, but it also has the name\r\nof Alphard, the Solitary. Since the naming of the star, science has\r\ndiscovered the latter name to be rather a misnomer for it has a\r\ntelescopic companion of a pale shade of green. Cor Hydræ rises in the\r\nearly evening on the 21st of February, and passes the meridian about 9\r\no'clock during the middle of March.\r\n\r\nThe northernmost star of the group that marks the head is also a double.\r\nThis double consists of two stars of the 4th and 8th magnitudes, the\r\nlarger one being yellow and the smaller purple.\r\n\r\n[Figure 87: Double Stars on Hydra, the Water-snake.]\r\n\r\nTwo geometrical figures called Corvus, the Crow, and Crater, the Cup,\r\nrest on the back of this Lernean Hydra. These two small constellations\r\nare easily traced, one having the form of a quadrilateral figure and the\r\nother a section of a circle. Kippax says that Crater has been variously\r\ncalled the Cup of Hercules, the Cup of Achilles, the Cup of Medea and\r\nthe Wine Cup of Noah. The Greeks called Crater the \"Goblet of Apollo\"\r\nbut according to Manilius it was the \"generous Bowl of Bacchus,\" God of\r\nWine.\r\n\r\n[Figure 88: During the springtime, Hydra, the Water-snake, may be seen\r\ncreeping along the horizon in the south.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this Water-snake is generally represented as the one connected\r\nwith the Labors of Hercules, there is also another legend which combines\r\nthe Crow, the Cup and the Snake in one tale. The crow was at one time\r\nApollo's favorite bird until one day, in anger at its tale bearing, the\r\nSun-god turned its color from pure white to black and forbade it\r\nto fly any longer among other birds. On another occasion this provoking\r\nlittle servant was given a cup and told to fetch some water for a\r\nsacrifice to Jupiter. Instead of attending to its duty, however, it\r\nloitered at a fig tree until the fruit became ripe, then returned to the\r\nGod with a watersnake in his claws and a lie on his tongue. For\r\npunishment the crow was fixed in the sky with the cup and the snake, the\r\nlatter being charged never to allow him to drink—although the\r\nconstellation Hydra, which stretches over a quarter of the sky, is\r\ncertainly not the same little reptile which the crow carried from the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nAURIGA, THE CHARIOTEER\r\n\r\n[Figure 89]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Charioteer\" is an ancient title retained by the constellation\r\nAuriga, although in the star-maps one usually finds a man of huge\r\nstature carrying a goat and two frightened kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Far in the north his giant form begins,\r\n    Reaching athwart the sky the distant Twins.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAuriga, according to the earliest Grecian legends, was a chariot-driver\r\nidentified with Erechtheus, son of the God Vulcan. Erechtheus inherited\r\nlameness from his father who was twice thrown from Mount Olympus, the\r\nsecond time falling on the Island of Lemnos instead of the sea,--which\r\nbroke his ankle. His son, fretting under the inconvenience caused by his\r\ndeformity, invented the four-horse chariot which provided himself and\r\nothers with an easy way of traveling from place to place. For this\r\nachievement Jupiter rewarded him with a constellation, choosing five\r\nbright stars which actually somewhat resemble an ancient chariot.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"His art great Jove admired, when first he drove\r\n    His rattling Car, and fix'd the Youth above.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Manilius._\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, on the star-maps, the Charioteer is pictured with a goat on his\r\nshoulders, instead of driving a chariot, although sometimes a chariot\r\nhas also been represented. Allen says that modern research gives us\r\nreason to believe that the constellation was delineated by the early\r\nstar-gazers of the Euphrates valley millenniums ago and perhaps the\r\nGreeks merely impressed their legends on another figure as it is\r\npossible they also did in the case of Hercules. The goat which the\r\nCharioteer holds, according to one tradition, was the goat on whose milk\r\nthe infant Jupiter was fed after he had been carried to the island of\r\nCrete to escape being devoured by his father Saturn, the God of Time.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The sacred goat upon his shoulder rests,\r\n    To infant Jove she gave a mother's breast.\"\r\n\r\nand then\r\n\r\n                \"Grateful he placed her there,\r\n    And bade her kids their mother's honour share.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is further related that one day while playing with the goat, Jupiter\r\naccidentally broke off one of its horns. In atonement, he filled the\r\nhorn with fruits and flowers--the horn of plenty--and consoled the goat\r\nby giving it a constellation. The brilliant star, Capella, lies on the\r\nheart of this goat, the name signifying \"the little She-goat,\" and not\r\nonly the Greeks and Romans, but the ancient Peruvians, far across the\r\nocean, connected this star with the affairs of shepherds. English poets\r\nrefer to Capella as the \"Shepherd's Star.\"\r\n\r\nIn the hand of this \"mighty man seated on the Milky Way,\" who is\r\nsometimes called the Charioteer or the Wagoner, are the two kids which\r\nwere raised with their mother to the stars.\r\n[Figure 90]\r\nThese kids may be recognized by a small triangle of stars not far from\r\nCapella. They were often called the \"frightened kids\" by the ancients.\r\nNo wonder they looked frightened--the long horns of the red-eyed Taurus\r\nare lowered in the sky below them, the gleaming blade of the hero\r\nPerseus is brandished among the stars not far to the side of them and\r\nthe huge bulk of the Great Bear is shadowed in the darkness just beyond\r\nthem. The ancient people also called them the \"horrid, mad stars\" and\r\nfeared their influence on the weather, for it so happened that these\r\ntimid little creatures were either near the eastern or the western\r\nhorizon during the storm weather. Since this coincidence happened year\r\nafter year without fail, it was felt that the Kids were in some way\r\nresponsible for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Tempt not the winds forewarned of dangers nigh,\r\n    When the Kids glitter in the western sky.\"\r\n\r\n                            --_Callimachus, 240 B.C._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch severe storms were so common on the Mediterranean when they\r\nglittered in the eastern sky during their early rising in October, that\r\ntheir appearance was a signal for the closing of navigation. After the\r\nstars had made their final disappearance in the west, the people held a\r\nfestival to celebrate their great relief and joy. The Kids were\r\ncertainly not a popular star group with the ancient seaman's wife, for\r\nliterature pictures her as clasping her hands and gazing fearfully out\r\nto sea as the winds and waves swirled and leaped under the influence of\r\nthe \"mad stars\" and imperiled the safety of her dear ones.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful first magnitude star Capella may be seen any month of the\r\nyear except July. It lies below and to the north of Perseus (three\r\nbright stars dangling below the Big W) and may be sighted in a straight\r\nline from the top of the bowl of the Big Dipper.\r\n[Figure 91]\r\nIn the early evening on February 5th it lies exactly on the meridian\r\nhalfway between Orion and the North Star, while in August it is low in\r\nthe northeast and in June low in the northwest.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope has shown that Capella really consists of two great\r\nsuns of nearly equal brilliance. These two stars lie so close together\r\nthat there is not much more than half the distance between our earth and\r\nsun between them,--and they revolve around this common center of gravity\r\nin only 104.2 days!\r\n[Figure 92]\r\nAs they revolve around this point the lines in the spectroscope\r\nperiodically split, thus proving the double nature of the star. In the\r\npresent state of our knowledge about eight stars out of twenty are\r\nbinaries or multiples.\r\n\r\nShort as seems the period of revolution of Capella and its companion\r\ncompared to Sirius and its companion, which is about 50 years, or the\r\ncouple of couples composing Castor, which is about 900 years, there are\r\nstars so close that they complete a revolution in a few hours. The very\r\natmospheres of one pair of suns, δ Cephei, perhaps intertwine like\r\nlovers' arms, for they whirl about their common center of gravity in\r\nonly 4½ hours!\r\n\r\nThe distance of Capella from the earth has been estimated as being about\r\n34 light years. A light year is the distance that light would travel in\r\none year at the rate of 186,000 miles a second. This is about six\r\nmillion million miles! Thus the twin suns in the system of Capella could\r\nhave rolled off their tracks and exploded into atoms 29 years ago and\r\nyet we would know nothing of this catastrophe for 5 years to come.\r\n\r\nThe fact that light takes a certain amount of time to travel and is not\r\ninstantaneous, was first discovered by watching the little moons\r\nof the planet Jupiter, although it has since been determined from\r\nexperiments on the surface of the earth. For a long time, an astronomer\r\ncould foretell on what night and hour an eclipse of a given satellite\r\nwould occur but he could not make the predicted minute agree with the\r\nactual time of eclipse. During the seventeenth century, Roemer, a Danish\r\nastronomer, discovered that the eclipses come 8 minutes and 18 seconds\r\nearly when the earth is nearest to Jupiter and 8 minutes and 18 seconds\r\nlate when it is on the opposite side of its orbit. He thus was the first\r\nto suspect that light could not flash instantaneously across the\r\n186,000,000 miles which is the diameter of the earth's orbit. After it\r\nwas found that light required 8 minutes and 8 seconds to come from the\r\nsun to the earth, it was a simple matter to find the space that it would\r\nmove over in a year. This number, 63,368 radii of the earth's orbit or\r\nabout six million million miles, has been since taken as a handy unit of\r\nmeasure in estimating the distances to the stars. Thus a _light year_ is\r\nthe distance that light will travel in a year at the rate of 186,000\r\nmiles a second. An astronomer expressing the distance of a star in terms\r\nof this unit would say that Alpha Centauri is 4.26 light years distant\r\ninstead of 25,000,000,000,000 miles, and 4.26 years would represent the\r\ntime that it takes light to come from that star to the earth.\r\n\r\nAlthough it takes light only about 8 minutes to reach the earth from the\r\nsun and about 4 years from the nearest star, it requires only one second\r\nfrom the moon, which is nearer than the sun, and 47 years from the North\r\nStar, which is a long way from being our nearest star. Sirius, our\r\nlargest star, is distant only 8½ light years, but Vega and Capella,\r\nwhich rank just below it, are respectively three and four times farther\r\naway. Some stars are so distant that it requires thousands of years for\r\ntheir light to reach us. According to the calculations of Kapteyn, only\r\none-eighth of the 6200 stars whose distance was measured are nearer than\r\n100 light years. Four of these stars are known to be within 10\r\nlight years--Alpha Centauri, Sirius, Barnard's \"runaway star,\" and one\r\nof the 7th magnitude known as Lalande 21,185. Yet all of these stars,\r\nthose which are only a few light years away and those which are hundreds\r\nof light years away, seem suddenly to be our neighbors, when we think of\r\nthem as being grouped within the protecting arms of the Milky Way, and\r\nthe space between, which science has measured, loses some of its\r\nawfulness.\r\n\r\nOur neighbor Capella is a beautiful star. It flashes like a great\r\nsolitaire, a star-poem of loveliness in color. Early in August, in the\r\nfar northeast, its creamy-whiteness is accentuated by seashell pinks\r\nwhich splash through the thickened atmosphere like the effervescence of\r\na rainbow. This star, with two others,--Vega, a delicate blue and\r\nArcturus, an orange-gold,--are the three brightest stars nearest the\r\nnorth. Since they are easy to locate and visible most of the year they\r\nare usually the star lover's favorites among the stars. Learn to locate\r\nthese exquisite isles of starlight by using the Big Dipper as a base\r\nfrom which to start.\r\n\r\n[Figure 93: How to locate Vega, Capella, and Arcturus with the aid of\r\nthe Big Dipper. Note also drawing on page 43.]\r\n\r\n[Figure 94: THE FOUR GREAT SOUTHERN STARS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGREAT STARS OF THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n    SPICA       FORMALHAUT\r\n\r\n    ANTARES     SIRIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH the exception of the stars in the constellation of Orion,--Spica,\r\nAntares, Formalhaut and Sirius are the only stars of the first magnitude\r\nsouth of the celestial equator which are visible from any point in the\r\nUnited States. The Orion stars are winter stars and will be taken up in\r\nthe chapter to follow, but these four stars, each of which in turn looms\r\nlonesomely in the south, are representatives of the seasons, and their\r\nvery names, Spica, Antares, Formalhaut and Sirius, bring to mind\r\nsuccessively, spring, summer, autumn and winter.\r\n\r\nSpica, the \"Spring Star,\" rises at sunset on the 10th of April and\r\ncrosses the meridian during the early evenings of April, May and June.\r\nIts beautiful silvery-white flame first appears just a little south of\r\neast and it takes only 5 hours and 25 minutes to cover half of its arc\r\nacross the sky. It is then a little less than half way up from the\r\nhorizon and hangs on the same curve from the Big Dipper's handle as\r\nArcturus.\r\n\r\nAntares rises at sunset on the first of June and passes the meridian\r\nearly in the evening during June and July. It rises farther south of\r\neast than Spica and takes only 4 hours and 23 minutes to reach the\r\nmeridian. It is then only one-quarter of the way up from the horizon.\r\nBeing a brilliantly red star in a conspicuous anchor-like constellation\r\nnear the Milky Way, it is very easy to locate.\r\n\r\nFormalhaut rises at sunset about the 10th of October and reaches the\r\nmeridian about 4 hours later. It first appears in the southeast and\r\nskims in a short arc closer to the horizon than any other first\r\nmagnitude star.\r\n\r\nSirius rises in the southeast about 9 o'clock on the first of December,\r\nbut anyone wishing to see this magnificent star during the summer months\r\nshould look toward the east about 4 o'clock in the morning on the 16th\r\nof August. In 5 hours and 3 minutes this star reaches the meridian,\r\none-third of the way up from the horizon. Sirius is the largest and\r\nloveliest star in the sky, possessing such a vivacious character\r\ncombined with a sparkling, diamond-like beauty, that it is a delight to\r\nevery eye that beholds it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPICA\r\n\r\n[Figure 95]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constellation of Virgo, in which Spica is found, is easily\r\nrecognized by its brilliant white star and its large V or corner of five\r\nstars which marks off the upper portion. The Arabian astronomers called\r\nthe corner \"The Kennel\" or \"The Retreat of the Howling Dog.\" Just beyond\r\nthe Kennel gleams the star-dust on Berenice's Hair, and above this\r\nsprinkling of minute stars, howl the furious hounds of Boötes\r\nstruggling madly to pounce upon the Bear.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable nebulous region lies within the triangular corner of\r\nVirgo, although the nebulæ are very faint and only visible through a\r\nlarge telescope. Nebulæ as a class are found in abundance in the\r\nvicinity of the north pole of the galaxy, which lies in the\r\nconstellation Coma Berenices, this corner alone containing almost 300,\r\nalthough they are rarely found along the path of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThe yellow 3rd magnitude star on the upper end of the corner in Virgo\r\nhas for many ages been called Vindemiatrix, which means\r\n\"Grape-Gatherer.\"\r\n[Figure 96]\r\nIt is believed that the star was given this curious name because it was\r\nobserved to rise before the sun in the season in which grapes ripened.\r\nVindemiatrix has a minute distant companion of a deep red color. The\r\nstar at the other end of the corner has the interesting name of\r\nZavijava, while the point is noted as a binary having a period of 185\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Figure 97]\r\n\r\nSpica, the \"jewel of the Virgin,\" is best located by dropping an\r\nimaginary line through Arcturus from the handle of the Big Dipper.\r\nIt rises about an hour later than Arcturus (who first appears at sunset\r\nduring the latter part of March), and travels in a curve through the\r\nsouth.\r\n[Figure 98]\r\nThese two stars contrast beautifully as they swing through the sky like\r\ngold and silver globes of fire strung on an invisible thread. A tale\r\ncurrent among ancient people was that Virgo, the Virgin, was once\r\nAstræa, Goddess of Purity and Justice, who lived on earth during the\r\nGolden Age when all men were happy. During the Silver Age contentment\r\nstill prevailed and the Gods lingered although men were less perfect and\r\nthe world less tranquil. When the Bronze Age was ushered in men became\r\nso inferior that the work of Astræa's office was ignored and she fled\r\nin sorrow to the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Even so long as the earth still nurtured the Golden Race, she had her\r\ndwelling on earth. But with the Silver Race only a little and no longer\r\nwith utter readiness did she mingle--\r\n\r\n\"When the Bronze Race was born she loathed them for they forged the\r\nsword of the highwayman, ate the flesh of the plowing ox and engaged in\r\nstrife and discord.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus_ (_Trans._ C. R. MAIR).\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow the goodness and purity of Astræa were incorporated in one\r\nbeautiful star called Spica, and this star shone with such exceeding\r\nwhiteness that the whole constellation became Virgo, the Virgin. The\r\npictures drawn on the maps vision a goddess with wings carrying a palm\r\nbranch in one hand and an ear of wheat in the other. In some of the\r\nolder maps, the goddess carries a balance or a pair of golden scales\r\nwith which to weigh the fate of mortals, but this is now a separate\r\nconstellation--Libra, the Scales--lying to the east of Virgo. In\r\nclassic days, the two bright stars which mark the Scales were on the\r\nclaws of the Scorpion which were then pictured as more extended.\r\n\r\nThe ancient people worshiped the constellation of Virgo with its\r\nbeautiful white star, and, even as a quiet prayer may be said in music\r\ninstead of in words, the purity of Spica seemed to glow like a\r\nbenediction upon their revering hearts.\r\n\r\nEven to the modern world, the springtime loveliness of this large and\r\nbeautiful star is refreshing. But we are wont to gaze upon it more with\r\nawe than reverence for science tells us that it is not only one white\r\nstar but two, the mass of each being much greater than that of our sun.\r\nThese two stars are only 11,000,000 miles apart and whirl around their\r\ncommon center of gravity in the amazingly short period of only four\r\ndays!\r\n\r\nSuch is the jewel found on the Virgin's ear of wheat, although the myths\r\ndo not all agree that Virgo is Astræa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Whether she be the daughter of Astræus, who, men say, was of old the\r\nfather of the stars, or the child of other sire, untroubled be her\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, they all do seem to agree that the constellation is connected\r\nin some way with the thought of harvests.\r\n\r\nVirgo was early identified as the Egyptian Isis who dropped an ear of\r\nwheat as she fled from the monster Typhon when he appeared around the\r\nNile. As a result the wheat was scattered in a wide path along the\r\nheavens which is now called the Milky Way. Among other characters, Virgo\r\nhas been regarded as Ceres, the Goddess of the Harvests, and even as\r\nCeres' daughter Proserpine. Plutarch seems to think that the Greeks are\r\nindebted to the Egyptians for their story of Ceres. Thus the Egyptian\r\nIsis would be Ceres, or Demeter. Isis also taught the use of corn which\r\nonce stood neglected in the fields. The story of Ceres and Proserpine\r\nis particularly beautiful and deserves a place in every one's\r\nthoughts. One cannot have too many associations as he gazes at the\r\nstarry skies, for each bit of even ancient gossip added to modern facts\r\nincreases the pleasure in knowing different stars. This is particularly\r\ntrue if one does not own a telescope of any kind, indispensable as it\r\nmay be to an astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Ceres, or Demeter, meaning \"Mother Earth\" (that is, not\r\nthe whole solid earth, but the portion that produces vegetation), stands\r\nin the sacred city of Eleusis, on the Thracian plain, and all men who\r\nearn their living by the soil come here to do her honor. This temple was\r\nbuilt on the spot where the Goddess met Triptolemus and taught him the\r\nuse of grains, also how to plow, sow the seeds and gather the crops\r\nafter they had ripened. Triptolemus then went forth and taught the\r\nnations of the world.\r\n\r\nOne day while Ceres was watching the harvests, Proserpine, her lovely\r\ndaughter, disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"While like a child with busy speed and care\r\n    She gathers lilies here, and vi'lets there;\r\n    While first to fill her little lap she strives,\r\n    Hell's grizzly monarch at the shade arrives.\r\n    See's her thus sporting on the flow'ry green\r\n    And loves the blooming maid as soon as seen.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Swift as a thought he seized the beauteous prey\r\n    And bore her in his sooty car away.\"\r\n\r\n                   --_Ovid's Metamorphoses_ (MAYNWARING'S Trans.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPluto, it seems, had come above the ground to survey the surface of the\r\nSicilian land, for the roof of his kingdom had been considerably shaken\r\non account of the struggles of the giant Typhon confined beneath the\r\nroots of Mount Etna. Poets claim that no sooner had the Underground God\r\nappeared than Cupid, the mischievous son of Venus, pulled a gold-tipped\r\narrow from his sheath, and laughing gleefully, shot the gloomy\r\nmonarch in the heart.\r\n\r\nCeres, in the meantime, nearly frantic with grief, searched over land\r\nand sea for her lost daughter, and when night fell, so that her search\r\nmight not be hindered, she tore up young pine trees by the roots and\r\ndipped them in the fires of Mount Etna. She could not eat, saying (as\r\nTennyson puts it) that the \"nectar smack'd of hemlock\" and the \"rich\r\nambrosia tasted aconite,\" while ancient poets claim that neither Aurora,\r\nthe Dawn, nor Hesperus, the Evening Star, ever saw her rest. Yet\r\nunweakened by fatigue and lack of sustenance, the goddess turned to the\r\nearth and forbade it to bear until Proserpine was returned to her.\r\n\r\nWhen Ceres discovered that the King of the somber, joyless region under\r\nthe ground had carried off Proserpine and made her the Queen of his\r\nShades, she left the home of the gods in anger and went to live among\r\nmankind. Jupiter at last becoming fearful for the fate of man if earth\r\nno longer bore fruit or grain, sent Mercury down to inquire of Pluto if\r\nthere was any hope of Proserpine's return. The Fates sent reply that if\r\nProserpine had not tasted the pomegranate, the food of death, she could\r\nnot be detained, otherwise she must remain forever. Ascalaphus then\r\nstepped forward and said that he had seen the Queen eat some of the\r\nseeds of this fruit,--for which tattling he was turned into a screech\r\nowl. Jupiter, pitying Ceres in her disappointment, succeeded in\r\neffecting a compromise by inducing his brother to allow Proserpine to\r\nspend six months of every year with her mother. This, the Greeks say, is\r\nthe cause of summer and winter.\r\n\r\nWhen Proserpine appears, Ceres commands the seeds, also, to force their\r\nway above the ground, the orchards become bright with a wealth of\r\nblossoms and the fields fresh with sprouts and vines. Ceres then is\r\nhappy and the world a busy, beautiful place in which to live, but when\r\nProserpine leaves, she cares not what happens, and the earth grows\r\nwithered and drear. Of all the myths, Virgo seems the most charming when\r\nidentified as Proserpine. Watch for the white flame of Spica as it rises\r\njust south of east on the 10th of April, for Spica shines on the ear of\r\nwheat in the hand of Ceres' daughter and is a symbol of the coming\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTARES\r\n\r\n[Figure 99]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe red star Antares lies on the heart of the Scorpion and stands out\r\nconspicuously with a bright star on either side.\r\n\r\nIn Greek legend this is the same Scorpion which so frightened Phæthon,\r\nrash child of the Sun-god, when he was driving his father's chariot\r\nalong the zodiac. The headstrong youth had experienced trouble enough in\r\npassing by the ferocious Nemean Lion, and he was just getting a free\r\nbreath while driving by the Virgin and the Scales when he came to this\r\nterrifying creature sprawled along and almost blocking the sky path.\r\nUnable to longer control either himself or his excited horses, Phæthon\r\nturned the steeds aside and blazed a new pathway, which soon grew cold\r\nand left a gray ash across the sky. The strip burned out by the\r\nscorching heat of the chariot may still be seen at night and is claimed\r\nby some to be the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThere is still another legend which tells how the scorpion came to be a\r\nconstellation. In ancient Greece there was once a mighty hunter named\r\nOrion. Armed with only a club, this powerful and handsome giant was able\r\nto conquer any beast in the world but, unfortunately, he boasted so\r\ncontinuously that Juno resolved to teach him a lesson. One day while he\r\nwas battling with a monster in a swamp, a poisonous scorpion\r\nslipped up and stung him on the heel. The wound proved fatal, although\r\nhe was afterward given a constellation as if in atonement for the rather\r\nmean advantage taken of so brave a hunter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The vast Orion thus he doomed to die,\r\n    And fix'd him, his proud trophy, in the sky.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Lucan's Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the scorpion was also honored in the same way, only he travels\r\nacross the sky in the summer months while Orion is seen during the\r\nwinter. Thus the two are considerately placed so that they do not shine\r\nabove the earth in the same season.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"And so 'tis said that when the Scorpion comes\r\n    Orion flies to the utmost ends of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constellation of the Scorpion lies southeast of Libra, the Scales,\r\nand is the ninth and most brilliant in the zodiac. The gigantic and\r\nclearly marked star design on his figure shows that the creature's head\r\nand outstretched claws extend upward and toward the west; the upraised\r\ntail, curving through the Milky Way and close to the horizon, lies south\r\nand eastward; while his feet touch the fainter stars to the right and\r\nleft. In the vicinity of his heart lies a star so large and red and\r\nbeautiful that it was named \"Antares,\" which means \"the rival of Ares\"\r\n(the planet Mars). This star so impressed the ancient people of Greece\r\nthat they built a temple in honor of it, where they might gaze upon it\r\nin solitude and worship it as if it were enthroned. This temple is one\r\nof the oldest found in Greece.\r\n\r\nPease, with the aid of the interferometer on the great 101-inch\r\ntelescope on Mount Wilson, has measured the diameter of Antares and has\r\nfound it to be a very enormous red sun. This figure taken in connection\r\nwith the best determined value of its distance, indicates that its\r\ndiameter is _four hundred million miles_! The volume of this star is\r\ntherefore about twenty-five million times as great as the volume of our\r\nsun. As far as we know, this is the largest star. This is surely most\r\ninteresting. We might have imagined these gloriously tinted stars as\r\nsmall-sized novelties scattered about the heavens for our special\r\nedification--certainly we did not expect to find that some of them were\r\nso tremendously large that they would pass by our little golden orb as a\r\nspeck of incandescent sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 100: THE BATTLE OF ORION, THE GIANT, AND TAURUS, THE BULL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only is Antares of interest because of its great size and charming\r\ncolor but it also possesses a companion star of the vividest shade of\r\ngreen. This companion was first noted during an occultation in 1819,\r\nquite amazing its observer by sliding out from behind the moon just\r\nbefore the large red star emerged and dimmed its light by its powerful\r\nruddy rays. The green-hued star is very tiny in comparison to Antares\r\nand may only be seen with the aid of a 5- or 6-inch telescope. Under\r\ngood atmospheric conditions it is a very beautiful object.\r\n\r\nThe flame-red sun Antares beside its woodsy-green companion is one of\r\nthe most impressive color combinations among the stars. Imagine living\r\non a planet whose orbits encompassed such ostentatious stars! A green\r\nsunrise with a livid sky and a red sunset with a scarlet one—then a\r\nred sunrise and a green sunset--if colors affect one the way it is\r\nsometimes said that they do, the inhabitants of such a planet might live\r\nthrough \"red hours\" and \"green hours\" like \"Dr. Jekylls\" and \"Mr.\r\nHydes.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a surprise to the eye and a delectable bit for the imagination are\r\nthe blue, gold, green, rose, lilac, purple and other fires in the\r\nsun-lit sky. Here is something \"as rare as a day in June.\" It would seem\r\nas if the whole solar system were enchanted if we might visit the\r\nplanets of a white and sapphire blue sun, for instance, or those of one\r\nof topaz-yellow and heliotrope hue. On the other hand it might seem\r\nbeyond the bounds of reason to an inhabitant of a planet with a\r\ndark blue sun that a ray of white light contains the whole seven primary\r\ncolors and that these colors are separately and in combination absorbed\r\nby the different objects on such a planet as our earth, permitting us to\r\nobserve a wonderful exhibition of tints and colors, gayety, shade and\r\nbrightness. If he, in his semi-dark blueness, could possibly visualize\r\nsuch a marvel as this, he surely would be well-nigh overwhelmed with the\r\nwonder of it. Perhaps our sun was the only star of the millions of stars\r\nin our Universe--(or in the innumerable Universes which drift in space\r\nbeyond the island of our Universe)--that was able to produce planets\r\nthat could bear life; and yet again, since the spectroscope has proved\r\nthat our sun is constituted like many another star in the heavens,\r\nperhaps these other stars, like our sun, also have planets. At least it\r\nis reasonable and rather exhilarating to think about it.\r\n\r\nAll the brilliant red stars are young and in the giant stage of their\r\ncareer but the faint red stars are dwarfs and on their decline. The\r\ndwarf red stars are believed to be cooling for they possess chemical\r\ncombinations only possible in a decreasing temperature relatively low\r\nfor stars. This must mean that such stars are growing old, for metallic\r\nvapors are never found in stars that are young.\r\n[Figure 101]\r\nIn a still later stage, these metallic vapors condense and form a solid\r\ncrust. About 500 red stars have already been observed but they are all\r\nat a distance vastly remote from the territory of our sun. Antares,\r\nhowever, is among the most youthful of the giant red stars and will\r\ngradually rise in temperature and become brilliantly blue during the\r\nnext few thousands of millions of years.\r\n\r\nHalfway between Antares and Akrab (β on the end of the upper claw),\r\nlies a very rich and condensed cluster of stars. This cluster, which is\r\none of the finest known, may be easily seen in a small telescope. On the\r\neastern side of the cluster is a dark nebula. Akrab is a triple star of\r\nthe 2nd, 4th and 10th magnitudes. The little star 2 degrees east of\r\nAkrab is of the 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th magnitudes and is claimed by some\r\nto be the most beautiful quadruple in the heavens. Many other\r\ninteresting stars may be seen around this conspicuous figure with a\r\n2½- or 3-inch telescope, and a handy little reference book for the amateur\r\nfortunate enough to possess such a telescope is William Tyler Alcott's\r\n\"In Starland with a Three-Inch Telescope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMALHAUT\r\n\r\n[Figure 102]\r\n\r\n\r\nFormalhaut is called the \"Fish's Mouth\" star because it is supposed to\r\nshine on the mouth of Piscis Australis, the Southern Fish. This Fish is\r\nrepresented in the star-maps as holding open its mouth in utter\r\ncontentment while a long line of small, glittering stars wash down in a\r\nstream of water. This water flows from the Urn of Aquarius, the\r\nWater-bearer, who stands just below the head of Pegasus, the Winged\r\nHorse. The Urn is formed by a little Y of 3rd and 4th magnitude stars,\r\nand, to the Egyptians, was an emblem of the rainy season.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Rolls from Aquarius' vase a limpid stream\r\n    Where numerous stars like sparkling bubbles gleam.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southern Fish must not be confused with the two tied fishes of the\r\nconstellation of Pisces, known as the \"Northern Fish,\" which lie\r\nto the east of the Waterbearer's Urn. This region of the sky has been\r\ncalled the \"Sky Sea,\" for not only does it contain three fishes but also\r\nCetus, the Whale, Delphinus, the Dolphin, and Capricornus, the Sea-goat.\r\n[Figure 103]\r\nThe three fish and the Seagoat were placed in the sky to commemorate the\r\nadventures of the Goddess Venus, the little God Cupid and the God Pan\r\nwith the terrible fire-breathing monster Typhon. When Typhon appeared\r\nwith a deafening roar, shaking his head and belching fire, the immortals\r\nfled in a panic before him, and when Venus and Cupid and Pan jumped into\r\na river, they were transformed into two fish and a Sea-goat.\r\n\r\n[Figure 104: The constellations which border the \"Sky Sea.\" All of these\r\nstars are not in view at the same time.]\r\n\r\nThe Southern Fish is connected in some way in the story but just how is \r\nnot quite clear. Northwest of Aquarius lies the region of birds, while \r\nbeyond the \"Sea\" to the southeast is the hunting scene of the giant \r\nOrion. The River Eridanus may also be seen flowing from a star near \r\nRigel, on the foot of Orion, to a point on the shore of the \"Sea.\" \r\n\r\nFormalhaut rises in the south at twilight about the 10th of October and\r\nwanders westward in a small arc above the horizon. It is visible such a\r\nshort time that it is said that it comes \"when the leaves begin to fall\r\nand goes while they are still falling.\" This star rises in the south at\r\nthe same time that Capella rises in the northeast, but an easier way of\r\nlocating it may be found by estimating two-thirds of the distance across\r\nthe sky from the outside stars in the bowl of the Big Dipper. It also\r\nlies almost exactly in a straight line with the two stars on the west\r\nside of the great Square of Pegasus at a distance equal to 3⅓ times\r\nthe distance between them and the southernmost of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIRIUS\r\n\r\n[Figure 105]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf all the diamonds in the world were melted into one huge, magical\r\njewel, its sparkling brilliance would pale beside Sirius, the diamond of\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful, iridescent beauty, fresh as a prismatic ice-flame, if\r\nsuch a thing might be, is best appreciated on a clear, cold winter night\r\nwhen the little stars swarm out like fire-flies and the large stars burn\r\nlike Aladdin gems of frost and fringing fire.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks, strange to say, dreaded the sight of this beautiful\r\nstar, for they not only imagined that its \"burning breath\" caused the\r\nunhealthy and oppressive heats of summer but that it was directly\r\nresponsible for their parched grass and blighted corn, their mad dogs\r\nand raging fevers!\r\n\r\nThe unpopularity of this star was due to the fact that during the\r\nhottest days of July it rose just before the sun and preceded that\r\nluminary all day long in his pathway through the heavens. Not knowing\r\nthat Sirius lay many millions of millions of miles beyond our solar\r\nsystem, they quite naturally supposed that his bright rays blended with\r\nthose of the sun, greatly intensifying the heat. Thus Sirius caused the\r\nhottest season of the year and all the dried fields, mad dogs, plagues\r\nand fevers were attributed to its malignant influence. Since the huge\r\nstar belonged to the constellation of Canis Major, the Great Dog, it was\r\ncalled the \"Dog Star\" and these hot, sultry days, the \"dog-days.\" The\r\ndog-days lasted for about 40 days, extending from 20 days before the\r\nheliacal rising of the Dog-star Sirius to 20 days after. Owing to the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, the heliacal rising of Sirius is different\r\nfrom what it was to the ancients and the dog-days are now counted from\r\nthe 3rd of July to the 11th of August.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Greeks, the ancient Egyptians held Sirius in the highest\r\nesteem and built splendid temples in its honor in the valley of the\r\nNile. J. Norman Lockyer has made an extensive study of Egyptian temples\r\nand has described them most interestingly in his book \"The Dawn of\r\nAstronomy.\" During his explorations he found seven temples which were\r\nconstructed solely to guide the light of Sirius through an opening in\r\nthe side of the temple, down a long hallway to a point on the central\r\naltar. Olcott in \"Star Lore of All Ages\" visualizes the following\r\nbeautiful scene in the most notable of these, the temple of Isis at\r\nDenerah:\r\n\r\n\"Here the rising beams of Sirius flashed down a long vista of massive\r\npylons and illuminated the inner recesses of the temple. What a\r\nwonderful scene there must have been enacted within that darkened\r\nedifice, when, in the presence of a vast multitude silent in meditation,\r\nthere suddenly appeared a gleam of silver light, that laved the marble\r\naltar in a refulgence born of the infinite, a beam, altho' the watchers\r\nknew it not, that had started on its earthward journey 8½ years before\r\nit greeted their eyes.\"\r\n\r\nWhy did the Egyptians reverence this star and hold it sacred while the\r\nancient Greeks watched the same heliacal rising and vehemently denounced\r\nit for journeying so close to the sun at a season when additional heat\r\nwas least desired? The Egyptians thought little about the heat, but with\r\nthe appearance of this star just before the rising of the sun they knew\r\nthat the season had arrived for the annual overflow of the Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Far in the south the daring waters rise,\r\n    As in disdain of Cancer's burning skies;\r\n    Thence, with a downward course, then seek the main,\r\n    Direct against the lazy northern wain.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Lucan's Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis heliacal rising of Sirius, which the Egyptians called Sothis, was\r\nan event which needs must be heeded, for, having no calendars in those\r\nancient days, it served as a warning that the river would soon overflow\r\nits banks and make a vast sea of the lowlands. It then behooved the\r\nhusbandmen and gardeners to act quickly, and move themselves and their\r\nherds and flocks up to the dykes in a place of safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Nile's redundant waters never rise\r\n    Till the hot Dog inflames the summer skies;\r\n    Nor to his banks his shrinking stream confines,\r\n    Till high in Heaven th' autumnal Balance shines.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Lucan's Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the inundation the lowlands are so completely covered with water\r\nthat towns and villages rise like islands, while here and there are seen\r\nthe tops of groves and fruit-trees like shrubs on the surface of the\r\nsea. This \"yearly tribute of rains\" which the Nile brings from other\r\ncountries, gives new life to the parched land of the Egyptians.\r\nHerodotus, centuries ago, said that Egypt was the gift of this river,\r\nfor without it their country would be a part of a lifeless desert.\r\nIn the words of Amru, Egypt first appears as a dusty plain, then as a\r\nfresh sea, and finally as a bed of flowers. To still better understand\r\nwhy seven great temples were erected for Sirius, the \"Nile Star,\" whose\r\nconstellation was sometimes called \"the watch-dog on the Nile,\" let us\r\nread Osborn's graphic description in \"Monumental Egypt\" of the\r\ntransformations resulting from the watering of the sands by the overflow\r\nof the great river which the Egyptians guarded and held sacred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Nile has shrunk within its banks until its stream has contracted to\r\nhalf its ordinary dimensions, and its turbid, slimy, stagnant waters\r\nscarcely seem to flow in any direction. Broad flats or steep banks of\r\nblack, unbaked Nile mud, form both shores of the river. All beyond is\r\nsand and sterility; for the ham-seen or sand-wind of fifty days duration\r\nhas scarcely ceased to blow. The trunks and branches of the trees may be\r\nseen here and there through the dusty, hazy, burning atmosphere, but so\r\nentirely are their leaves coated with dust that at a distance they are\r\nnot distinguishable from the desert sand that surrounds them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen comes the inundation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there is not in Nature a more exhilarating sight, or one more\r\nstrongly exciting to confidence in God, than the rise of the Nile. Day\r\nby day, night by night, its turbid tide sweeps onward majestically over\r\nthe parched sands of the waste howling wilderness. Almost hourly, as we\r\nslowly ascended it before the Etesian wind, we heard the thundering fall\r\nof some mud bank, and saw by the rush of all animated Nature to the\r\nspot, that the Nile had overleapt another obstruction, and that its\r\nbounding waters were diffusing life and joy through another desert.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the flood comes sowing time and the effects of it all are\r\nexhibited:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"in a scene of fertility and beauty such as will scarcely be found in\r\nanother country at any season of the year. The vivid green of the\r\nspringing corn, the groves of pomegranate trees ablaze with the rich\r\nscarlet of their blossoms, the fresh breeze laden with the perfumes of\r\ngardens of roses and orange thickets, every tree and every shrub covered\r\nwith sweet-scented flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the appearance of Sirius was hailed with reverence when\r\nits rising just before the sun meant also the rise of the life-giving\r\nriver and the prosperity of the inhabitants of Egypt! However, as\r\nmentioned before, with the precession of the equinoxes, the heliacal\r\nrising of Sirius has changed and its brilliant light no longer announces\r\nthe rising of the Nile.\r\n\r\nSirius is one of our nearest stars for its light requires only 8½ years\r\nto reach the earth. Yet its nearness does not account altogether for its\r\nquite exceptional brightness, for our sun at the same distance would\r\nappear as a star of the 6th magnitude and be invisible to the unaided\r\neye. Only two stars, as far as has yet been discovered, lie closer to\r\nthe earth than Sirius. The second brightest star in the sky is Canopus,\r\nvisible from the southern hemisphere, but so far away that its distance\r\ncan scarcely be estimated.\r\n\r\nHalley, a celebrated English astronomer born 1656, made the first\r\ndiscovery of the relative motion of the stars when he noted that Sirius\r\nhad moved from the position assigned to it on Ptolemy's map of 150 A. D.\r\nWe have now reliable data for discussing the proper motion of about\r\n10,000 stars. The proper motion of stars consists of a displacement in\r\nvarious directions of the individual stars. Thus the configuration of a\r\nconstellation may slowly change, and, although many groups of stars all\r\ntravel in the same direction, there are also conspicuous instances where\r\nthey move in different directions. The Big Dipper and the Southern Cross\r\nare two star groups whose stars are traveling along different courses\r\nand after a period of time extending over thousands of years, the\r\n'dipper' and the 'cross' effect of these two constellations will have\r\naltogether disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor a while Sirius was believed to be traveling in a straight line, but\r\nsoon irregularities were discovered in the great star's motion, an\r\n\"undulatory progressive motion\" on each side of a middle line. From a\r\nknowledge of these oscillating movements, Bessel inferred that\r\nSirius must have an unseen companion attracting or pulling it as the two\r\nstars traveled together around a common center of gravity. In 1862, Mr.\r\nAlvan G. Clarke of New York detected this companion situated at an\r\nangular distance of only 7\" from Sirius,--about as far distant as Uranus\r\nis from the earth. The larger star is only about twice as massive as its\r\ncompanion but is 20,000 times brighter. The light that we see from\r\nSirius then comes from two stars which together radiate 48 times as much\r\nlight as the sun. Compared to Sirius, our sun is rather an inconspicuous\r\nstar, although Barnard gave us great satisfaction by discovering a\r\nneighbor not much farther away than Sirius which gives out only\r\n¹⁄₂₅₀₀ as much light as the sun!\r\n\r\nSirius, the \"Dog Star,\" rests on the nose of the Great Dog, in the\r\nconstellation Canis Major, and may be found in a straight line from the\r\nthree evenly spaced stars in Orion's Belt. He was originally Orion's\r\nhunting dog, and, as if to give atmosphere to a hunting scene in the\r\nsky, Lepus, the Hare, has been placed on a constellation just in front\r\nof Sirius and below the feet of Orion, where he is \"pursued continually\r\nthrough all time\" by the Dog with the huge star.\r\n\r\nA vividly red variable star glows in the constellation of Lepus, the\r\nHare. Every so often, this little star becomes radiantly red. This\r\nadditional light is caused by the star bursting explosively through the\r\nlayer of absorbent vapors which are smothering the life from its flames.\r\nSome day this crimson star will flare and flicker for the last time and\r\nits final ray be wafted to our earth--the Swan Song of a dying star.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 o'clock during the first part of December, Sirius rises on its\r\npathway south of east, the brilliant beauty of its light adding to the\r\ncelestial scene like a torch among a thousand candles. This is true\r\nthough the month of December exhibits the loveliest assembly of stars to\r\nbe seen in all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom December on into early spring, the Dog Star is the cynosure of\r\nevery eye. Night after night, through the winter evenings, it flashes in\r\nthe sky a little farther west; finally it gleams in the western sky at\r\nsunset, jewels the rim of the horizon, and disappears.\r\n\r\n[Figure 106: Orion and the \"Dog Star.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 107: THE WINTER BATTLE OF ORION, THE GIANT, AND TAURUS, THE BULL.\r\nThese beautiful constellations first make their appearance during\r\nOctober, although they may be viewed to better advantage during the\r\nwinter-time, when they lie directly in the south.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF ORION AND TAURUS, THE BULL\r\n\r\n\r\nORION, THE MIGHTY HUNTER\r\n\r\n[Figure 108]\r\n\r\n\r\nOF all the interesting star-scenery that we pass as we travel in our\r\nyear-long, never-ending path around the sun, the most magnificent and\r\nimpressive is the figure of the beautiful constellation of Orion.\r\n\r\nThis constellation is not only one of the largest, but its stars are so\r\nparticularly vivid as a group and so uniquely arranged as a design, that\r\nthey never fail to catch the eye of even the casual observer,--like the\r\ncarpenter, who, on noticing it for the first time, humorously exclaimed,\r\n\"Well, look at the house-roof up in the sky!\" thus unconsciously\r\nrecognizing the stars as being united in a common picture or\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nAll the ancient legends agree in describing Orion as a giant of\r\nextraordinary height and the greatest hunter in the world. Classical\r\nevidence is abundant as to his huge stature, though obviously, this\r\nevidence is not trustworthy. Pliny reports that an earthquake in Crete\r\ndisclosed the bones of a giant 46 cubits in length, held by some to be\r\nOrion. A cubit is an ancient measure of about 18 inches so that if\r\nPliny's report is correct, Orion was 69 feet tall.\r\n\r\nThere are many stories which relate the adventures of Orion but\r\nthese vary even to the point of contradiction. Even the manner of his\r\ndeath is open to question, the two most popular versions being as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nDiana, the lovely Moon-goddess, sometimes neglected to carry the moon\r\nacross the sky so that she might spend the evening hunting with her\r\nnymphs upon the mountains. On one of these occasions she met Orion, the\r\nmighty hunter, and straightway fell in love with him, thereby so greatly\r\ndispleasing her twin-brother Apollo, the Sun-god, that he determined to\r\nput an end to the affair. The opportunity, unfortunately, came soon\r\nafterward when the hunter was wading in the sea. Pouring his golden rays\r\non Orion so that the brightness would conceal him, the god suggested to\r\nthe goddess that they practice archery on the beach. Then, pointing to a\r\nbright object shining on the waves in the distance, Apollo persuaded\r\nDiana to try her skill by aiming one of her arrows at it. Diana aimed,\r\nand since she had never missed, the arrow hit its mark. Amid the ruffled\r\nwaters tossed about in the giant's death agony, the goddess recognized\r\nthe face of her beloved, and weeping bitterly, accused Apollo of the\r\nwildest category of sins. Proceeding then to Jupiter, she begged that\r\ngod to place the hunter among the stars where she might always see him\r\nshining in the night time, as she drove her silver chariot along the\r\npathway of the zodiac.\r\n\r\nAnother legend claims that Orion's death was caused by the sting of a\r\npoisonous scorpion which Juno had commanded to spring out of the ground\r\nand punish him for his unparalleled boasting. This has already been\r\nreferred to in a previous chapter. Although the scorpion and the hunter\r\nwere both placed in the sky, they were considerately situated in such\r\npositions, that when the Hunter appears in the east, the Scorpion\r\ndisappears below the horizon in the west, thus saving the hunter the\r\nembarrassment of seeing his innocuous conqueror.\r\n\r\nStill another legend describes the attempt of Æsculapius, famous\r\nphysician and son of Apollo, to restore Orion to life. This attempt so\r\nangered Jupiter, due to the influence of Pluto, who had become irritated\r\nby the physician's power to detain a soul after it had started for the\r\nKingdom under the ground, that Jupiter sent one of his thunderbolts and\r\nannihilated Æsculapius, otherwise his brother's realms might in time\r\nhave become depopulated. Apollo, in fury, shot the one-eyed Cyclops who\r\nhad furnished the thunderbolts, and then sought Jupiter, as had his\r\nsister, and requested him to place the physician in the sky and light\r\nhim up with everlasting stars, for this was the second son that he had\r\nkilled with a thunderbolt and he was feeling rather badly about it.\r\nJupiter, having no objection to this, kindly granted the request, and it\r\nis believed by many that the physician is represented by Ophiuchus, a\r\nhuge sky figure whose head rests next to that of Hercules.\r\n\r\nWhen Orion was placed in the sky, he was allowed to bring along his\r\nlion's skin, which hangs on his arm, his sword, which swings from his\r\ngirdle, his great club, which he flourishes above his head, and his two\r\ndogs, who watch his battle with the red-eyed Bull.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Begirt with many a blazing star,\r\n    Stood the great giant Algebar\r\n    Orion, hunter of the beast.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\nTaurus, the Bull, is easily recognized by his V-shaped face and the red\r\nglare of the star which marks his eye. This angry creature charges with\r\nlowered head, his golden horns just above the Hunter, who defends\r\nhimself with his club now decked with glittering star-points and forces\r\nthe Bull to back before him all the way across the sky.\r\n\r\nA first glimpse of the Hunter and the Bull may be obtained in the east\r\nabout midnight during late October although it is more convenient\r\nto look for them in November or December when the Hunter's huge figure\r\nstands squarely in the south. By the middle of May, the battle scene has\r\nreached the western horizon. One by one, each sparkling light disappears\r\nnot to be seen again until the following October. One should say perhaps\r\n'at a convenient hour' for in the summer-time Orion may be seen in the\r\neast at dawn. Aurora, the Dawn-goddess, up bright and early to open the\r\nsun gates for Apollo, saw the handsome hunter on the sky slope decked\r\nwith red and white and yellow lights of stars. Like Diana, she loved him\r\nimmediately, but, in the words of the poets, he pales before her\r\ncolorful radiance as she reaches upward to announce the coming of the\r\nsun. Because dawn takes away the stars, Orion is said to have been\r\ncarried away by this goddess and even yet this story may be seen enacted\r\nwhen watching the glory of Orion captured by Aurora as she flashes\r\nrosy-tinted in the east.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LION'S SKIN OF ORION\r\n\r\n[Figure 109]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the course of his adventurous wanderings on earth, Orion once\r\ncame to the Island of Chios, in the Ægean Sea, where he fell in love\r\nwith a maiden named Merope. In order to display his skill as a hunter,\r\nhe cleared the island of its scourge of wild beasts and brought their\r\nskins as presents to his sweetheart. This he accomplished alone and\r\nunaided except by his mighty club and the protecting hide of a lion.\r\nThis is the same lion's skin that he wears in the sky during his\r\nstruggle with Taurus, the Bull, only here it is adorned by a faintly\r\ncurved row of tiny 4th and 5th magnitude stars, and about ten stars of\r\nthe 6th magnitude. This \"tawny skin\" hangs over the Hunter's left arm\r\nbetween his western shoulder and the Bull.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"And on his arm the lion's hide\r\n    Scatters across the midnight air\r\n    The golden radiance of his hair.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skin appears first of all above the eastern horizon and its little\r\nstars flutter vigorously as if being shaken warningly at any who might\r\ndefy him. Then Orion, arrayed in large stars, slowly rises from his\r\nreclining position along the eastern ledge. One might imagine that he at\r\nfirst peers along the south in search of the poisonous scorpion which\r\nhad stung him on the heel, for this must have been a supreme humiliation\r\nfor so brave a hunter. But there is nothing in the south but the river\r\nEridanus and the lightly starred Sea-monster with his head reared upward\r\ntoward Andromeda. Feeling reasonably safe from any rear attacks, Orion\r\nnow confidently climbs the darkened eastern slope; his Lion's Skin\r\ntwinkles as he tautens his arm; his great Club is raised in readiness\r\nabove his head, and joying in the combat, he henceforth wages, in\r\nunmolested peace, his eternal battle with Taurus, the Bull.\r\n\r\n\r\nBETELGEUSE, ON ORION'S SHOULDER\r\n\r\n[Figure 110]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust opposite the Lion's Skin, on the right shoulder of the Hunter,\r\nrests the beautifully tinted star, Betelgeuse. This star, like Antares,\r\nmakes one think of roses, although Antares is more the shade of a deep\r\nred rose, while Betelgeuse is a wild rose pink. Diana probably notes the\r\ndecoration as she passes in her chariot, for on certain dates she drives\r\ndirectly in front of his head-stars. On the opposite shoulder lies the\r\nyellow Bellatrix, \"the female warrior or Amazon star.\" The title of this\r\nstar was likely given it in honor of Orion's mother, who was\r\nfabled as Euryale, the famous Amazon Queen.\r\n\r\nOn account of recent discoveries concerning it, Betelgeuse has become\r\none of the most interesting of our stars. When Professor Michelson of\r\nthe University of Chicago discovered a means of measuring the diameter\r\nof stars, he measured Betelgeuse and found it to be of the most enormous\r\nsize. Indeed, if this huge rose-tinted star were placed in the position\r\nof our sun, it would fill the solar system nearly to the planet Mars!\r\n\r\nThis unique achievement of measuring the diameter of a star made the\r\nworld sit up in amazement. The measurement was made at the Mount Wilson\r\nObservatory with the largest reflecting telescope ever made, a telescope\r\nwhich has an aperture of a little more than 100 inches. A set of mirrors\r\nwas attached in such a way that for the purpose of measurement the\r\neffect of a 20-foot aperture was obtained and Professor Michelson was\r\nable to prove that the disk of Betelgeuse has an angular diameter of\r\napproximately one twenty-second of a second--which means that if the\r\ndistance deduced from the best determined parallax of the star is\r\ncorrect, the actual diameter is 230,000,000 miles! But this giant red\r\nstar is a globe of little density; the dwarf red stars, although about\r\nthe same mass, are found to be more compact. Hale in \"The New Heavens\"\r\nsays that there are good reasons for believing that \"the mass of\r\nBetelgeuse cannot be more than ten times that of the sun's volume.\r\nTherefore its average density must be like that of an attenuated gas in\r\nan electric vacuum tube.\" It is difficult to adjust one's everyday\r\nconception of a star to such a sheer and rarefied object. Such a star\r\nseems almost too spiritual to exist, and is certainly an amazing thing\r\nto picture in the heavens. But Betelgeuse is not a starry spirit, but a\r\nfull-fledged mammoth star, though it is only recently (in a cosmic\r\nsense) that it started on its career.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGEL, ON ORION'S FOOT\r\n\r\n[Figure 111]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brilliant white light of Rigel on Orion's foot shines in charming\r\ncontrast to the pink-tinged Betelgeuse which lies upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\nRigel is a young star but not as young as Betelgeuse, for Betelgeuse,\r\nlike ruddy Antares, is among the youngest of the stars.\r\n\r\n[Figure 112:\r\n\r\n   \"The scorched waters of Eridanus' tear-swollen flood\r\n    Welling beneath the foot of Orion.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Aratus._]\r\n\r\nIt has been many hundred million years since Rigel was as big and red as\r\nBetelgeuse now is. Rigel belongs to a group which includes the hottest\r\nof all the stars and even at a distance of at least 450 light years, it\r\nstill appears so brilliant that it is one of our brightest stars. It has\r\nbeen estimated that in actual luminosity it exceeds our sun about 13,000\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nA blue star of the 9th magnitude lies close beside Rigel. This little\r\nstar may be seen with even a small telescope.\r\n\r\nJust a little west of Rigel wanders a crooked line of stars, first\r\ntoward Cetus, then southward toward the horizon. This is the \"poor\r\nremains\" of the river Eridanus. Aratus speaks of it as those \"poor\r\nremains\" because it represents what is left of the \"amazed Eridanus\"\r\nafter Phæthon had, like a streaming comet, plunged into it and partly\r\nburned it up. Aratus also calls it \"The River of Many Tears\" because the\r\nHeliades, Phæthon's sisters, who were metamorphosed into poplar trees,\r\n\"all the day stand round the tomb and weep\" great amber tears.\r\n\r\nThis constellation, which is best seen directly in the south during\r\nSeptember, is a tribute of respect to the grief of the Sungod who had\r\ngazed with horror at the wild flight of the sun-horses and the\r\nthunderbolt of Jupiter that had hurled his boy through the air. Touched\r\nby Apollo's remorse for allowing the youth to drive his horses, Jupiter\r\ndrew the river to the heavens, thinking that it might be a consolation\r\nto Apollo, as he performed his daily task, to view the kindly river, now\r\nflecked with stars, which had once caught the \"charred fragment\" of\r\nPhæthon and \"cooled it in his waters.\"\r\n\r\n[Figure 113:\r\n\r\n   \"But earthbound winds could not dismember thee,\r\n    Nor shake thy frame of jewels.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Charles Tennyson Turner._]\r\n\r\n\r\nORION'S HEAD\r\n\r\n[Figure 114]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe head of Orion is marked by two small stars and a larger one. These\r\nstars form a tiny triangle named Meissa, which means \"The Head of the\r\nGiant.\" The three stars form rather a small head for the rest of the\r\ngiant's well proportioned body, so they are sometimes placed on the side\r\nof his head and sometimes as beauty-spots upon his face, according to\r\nthe fancy of the artist who portrays him. The triangle is faint but very\r\neasily seen and a happy addition to the figure; without them, or if they\r\nhappened to lie in another position, the constellation might well have\r\nrepresented something other than a giant.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious optical illusion which occurs when the moon is among\r\nthese stars, for the big, round full face of the moon actually _passes\r\nthrough_ the sides of this (seemingly) tiny triangle. But one must be on\r\nthe alert to view this interesting occurrence for the Moon-goddess\r\ntravels swiftly in her chariot over the sky and leaves even her lover no\r\nmore than a passing caress. The explanation is, that the triangle of\r\nstars on Orion's head appears small in comparison with the great\r\nquadrilateral figure which lies below it, and the delusion as to the\r\nsize of the moon is accounted for partly as a result of its brightness\r\n(the bright rays spreading its image on the retina), and partly because\r\nthere is nothing in the sky with which to compare it. When the moon\r\nrises behind a tree on the hillside it seems a mammoth thing, a silver\r\nball so huge that it seems almost absurd to state that it can flit\r\nbetween the sides of Orion's triangle. Yet the closer it comes to\r\nOrion's head the smaller does it seem to become and the larger becomes\r\nthe triangle. When the two touch sides, the triangle is seen to be large\r\nenough to contain the moon, which slides through without touching its\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n\r\nORION'S BELT\r\n\r\n[Figure 115]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough most popularly known as the \"Belt of Orion,\" this Belt is also\r\nknown by other names. In the Book of Job it is referred to as the \"Bands\r\nof Orion\"; in the mythology of Greece and Rome, as the arrow with which\r\nDiana killed the hunter when he was wading in the sea, and in the\r\nmythology of Northern races, as Frigga's jeweled Spinning Wheel with\r\nwhich the Goddess wove the long threads of fleecy clouds. Miss Proctor\r\nsays that the Eskimos believe that the stars may be three seal hunters\r\nwho have lost their way, and call them the \"Lost Ones,\" although they\r\nalso think that the Belt resembles three steps cut in a snowbank. The\r\nnative Australians unite the Belt stars in a picture with the Pleiad\r\ngroup above Orion's shoulder and, according to Allen, imagine them as\r\nthree young men \"dancing a corroboree\" while the Pleiades are the\r\nmaidens playing for them. In England the Belt is called the \"Ell and\r\nYard,\" the \"Yard Wand\" and the \"Golden Yard,\" because its stars are\r\nequidistant like a measuring rod; it is also called \"Jacob's Staff\" and\r\nsometimes the stars are called the \"Three Kings,\" although the Germans\r\ncall them the \"Three Mowers.\" Far south on the hot deserts, the Arabs\r\nsee the Belt stars as a \"String of Pearls\" and the Arabian astronomers,\r\ngiving each pearl a name, called the first Mintaka, the second Alnilam\r\nand the third Alnitak. Other countries have called the stars \"The\r\nSpangles\" and \"The Golden Grains,\" while Tennyson speaks of them as\r\nbeing \"burnished by the frosty dark,\" which is the poet's way of saying\r\nthat the stars of the Giant's Belt are exceptionally beautiful.\r\n\r\nModern astronomers turning their telescopes upon the stars of this\r\nBelt note that there is more to be seen here than meets the unaided eye,\r\nfor suspended from either side, like an added attempt at decoration,\r\nhang tiny stars of different sizes, daintily colored. Mintaka (δ), the\r\ndouble star on the west, is a white and pale violet, of the 2nd and the\r\n7th magnitudes. Alnitak (ζ) on the lower end to the southeast, is a\r\ntopaz-yellow, light purple and gray, of the 2nd, 6th and 10th\r\nmagnitudes. The faint star just below Alnitak is composed of an\r\nexquisite group of delicate stars of various colors.\r\n\r\nIf the north pole of our earth was shot out like a dart, it would hit\r\nthe dome of our sky somewhere in the vicinity of the North Star.\r\nLikewise, if the earth's equator could be conceived of as swelling and\r\nswelling and swelling, it would hit Orion just about at the top star of\r\nhis belt. The circular line where this imaginary terrestrial hoop would\r\nfit against the heavens is called the celestial equator and it, of\r\ncourse, is in a position equally distant between the two heavenly poles.\r\nA good way to remember just where the celestial equator passes is\r\nnoticing the pathway which the star mentioned above traces in its\r\njourney from east to west. A teacher of astronomy would now add that not\r\nonly is the terrestrial equator marked as the celestial equator in the\r\nsky, but every meridian of the 'swollen' earth is traced up there as an\r\nhour circle, all of the hour circles being fastened in a great framework\r\nto both poles, as they are on earth. But instead of latitude the\r\nastronomer says declination, and in place of longitude he says right\r\nascension, just as in place of meridian, he says hour circle. He then\r\ncan designate the places of the stars in the sky in exactly the manner\r\nin which he designates the position of a sea or a city on the earth and\r\nas large telescopes are provided with equatorial mountings, so that\r\ntheir axes conform with that of our earth, objects in the sky can be\r\nlocated by the use of graduated circles and verniers, thus greatly\r\nfacilitating astronomical research.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NEBULA OF ORION\r\n\r\n[Figure 116]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive spectacles in the sky lies on the center of\r\nthe Sword of Orion. This Sword is adorned with three stars, the central\r\none appearing misty, \"like an eye in tears.\" A large telescope discloses\r\nthat this is not a star after all but beautiful cloudy masses of\r\nnebulæ, which cover the whole central part of the constellation. A\r\nphotograph uncovers a still further surprise (for the eye of a camera is\r\nmore sensitive to light than the eye at a telescope), and one sees then\r\nthat the nebula spreads in all directions, over and beyond most of the\r\nstars on the Hunter's figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is a wonderful sight,\" says Peck in \"The Constellations,\" \"the whole\r\nfield of view is filled with an irregular mass of green shining mist,\r\nwhich is apparently broken up into flocculent masses, delicate clouds of\r\nlight, sprays and wisps, and standing out from the cloudy background,\r\nlike a sprinkling of diamond dust, are seen faint, glittering stars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVast masses of dark nebulæ in the Nebula of Orion are also effectively\r\nrevealed in telescopes. The dark nebula is visible in the photographs as\r\nveil-like clouds obscuring the light of the stars beyond them, or,\r\nagain, as definitely outlined black blotches lying like some huge object\r\non a brilliantly glowing background. Such a 'blotch' is the Dark Bay or\r\nDark Horse Nebula in Orion whose photograph is so fearfully suggestive\r\nand wonderfully beautiful.\r\n\r\nNebulous clouds are, in general, dark rather than luminous. These clouds\r\nare believed by many astronomers to be cosmic dust-particles driven out\r\nfrom bright stars. These particles finally collect in great clouds\r\nwhich, when far from the light of stars, are dark. When the accumulating\r\nclouds of dust become so heavy that gravitation begins to draw their\r\nparticles together, heat is generated and the mass begins to glow,\r\nalthough sometimes dark masses, if they are close to stars, will glow\r\nwith reflected starlight. The gaseous clouds are devoid of solid or\r\nliquid matter, and consist, the spectroscope shows, of glowing gases,\r\napparently nebulium and hydrogen. Thus the Nebula of Orion, which is a\r\ngaseous nebula, is never spoken of as a \"universe,\" like the Nebula of\r\nAndromeda, which may be resolved into stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 117: THE DARK BAY OR DARK HORSE NEBULA IN ORION.\r\nPhotograph by Mount Wilson Observatory through the 100-inch\r\nHooker telescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe finest example of an irregular nebula is the Nebula of Orion; of a\r\nring nebula, that found in the constellation of Lyra; and of a spiral\r\nnebula, the one found in the constellation of Canes Venatici, just below\r\nthe handle of the Big Dipper. The spiral of Andromeda, which is turned\r\nedgewise to the earth, is the largest nebula in the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nORION'S TWO DOGS--CANIS MAJOR AND CANIS MINOR\r\n\r\n\r\nCanis Major, the \"Great Dog\" of Orion, lies in a straight line southeast\r\nof his Belt Stars. Canis Minor, his \"Small Dog,\" lies across the Milky\r\nWay, 20 degrees northeast of Betelgeuse, the pink star on his shoulder.\r\nThe three stars form a large and easily traced triangle.\r\n\r\nCanis Minor is usually pictured as a Spaniel standing on the bank of the\r\nMilky Way and gazing across its river of stars at the giant Orion with\r\nhis club upraised against the Bull. Although this dog is usually said to\r\nbe Orion's dog, it is sometimes claimed to be one of Diana's hounds that\r\nfollowed her in the hunt. Other legends claim that Canis Minor was the\r\ndog of Icarus who discovered the slaying of his master by the shepherds\r\nof Attica and for this was placed among the stars. Procyon, the\r\nbrightest star in this constellation, is called the \"Little Dog's\r\nStar.\" It appears above the eastern horizon on the 23rd of January just\r\nafter darkness, and shines for about half an hour before Sirius appears\r\nupon the scene.\r\n\r\n[Figure 118]\r\n\r\nSirius is the head star of Canis Major and the brightest star in the\r\nsky. This dog sits at the feet of Orion watching Lepus, the Hare.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAURUS, THE BULL\r\n\r\n[Figure 119]\r\n\r\n   \"Aries glorious in his golden wool,\r\n    Looks back and wonders at the mighty Bull.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Manilius._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the bull that Orion chases backwards across the winter's sky,\r\nalthough only his foremost portion is visible among the stars. The rest\r\nof this creature might be imagined as hidden behind a cloud; but no,\r\nmythologists say the other half is immersed beneath the waves of the\r\nsea. Beneath the waves of the sea! It looks to us as if he were\r\ndefending himself with considerable gusto against the advance of\r\nOrion, for did we not see him clamber backwards up the slope in the east\r\nonly an hour and a half ahead of the giant who rose with his star club\r\nlifted menacingly above his head?\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Thy hoofs, unwilling, climb the sphery vault;\r\n    Thy red eye trembles in an angry glare,\r\n    When the hounds follow, and in fierce assault\r\n    Bay through the fringes of the lion's hair.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Bayard Taylor._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf thus engaged, why was Taurus placed in the sky with a little\r\ncross-section of the sea about him? It was quite likely, we find, to\r\npreserve a note on the following legend:\r\n\r\nJupiter, the great ruler of Olympus, once changed himself into a\r\nsnow-white bull. Such baffling disguises were the delight of this god\r\nwhen he had some particular object in view. This particular time he\r\nwished to carry off Europa, Princess of Phœnicia. He found the Princess\r\nplaying in the meadow\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"joyous, fresh, with roses bound\r\n    About her sunny head, and on her cheek\r\n    The glow of morn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand placing himself conspicuously amongst the scenery, he soon caught\r\nher attention.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Europa spied this strange, white, gentle-appearing creature,\r\nshe ran over to it, caressed it, and finally climbed upon its back. No\r\nsooner had she done this, than the bull, gathering the speed of the\r\nwind, ran to the sea-shore, plunged into the waves, and swam to the\r\nIsland of Crete.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Sweet Europa's mantle blew unclasp'd\r\n    From off her shoulders backward borne;\r\n\r\n   \"From one hand droop'd a crocus; one hand clasp'd\r\n    The mild bull's golden horn.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little Princess gave her name to the continent of Europe and the\r\nwhite bull was placed among the constellations.\r\n\r\nThus a plausible explanation is found for but half of the bull being\r\nshown among the stars--he is carrying Europa across the waves--then we\r\nlook on his starry mane and find--not sweet little Europa clinging\r\nthere, but seven lithesome maidens! These are represented by a lovely\r\ngroup of stars called the Pleiades. How does this happen? Well, that is\r\nanother story.\r\n\r\nOne day, while hunting, Orion came suddenly upon seven graceful sisters\r\ndancing on the mossy turf in the woodland. He watched entranced until\r\nthe happy creatures noticed him, and filled with terror at his gigantic\r\nstature, turned and fled.\r\n[Figure 120]\r\nFor five long years they ran, with Orion close behind, until weary and\r\ndistressed they begged the gods for aid.\r\n\r\nThen Orion saw the maidens vanish as seven fluttering doves which flew\r\nfar up into the sunlit sky. That evening Diana saw them, and telling\r\nthem to keep up heart, drove her moon-chariot past Olympus where she\r\ndirected Jupiter's attention to the unfortunate plight of the maidens.\r\nJupiter then changed the doves to stars and placed them on the back of\r\nTaurus, the Bull. Here they rest protected by a pair of golden horns,\r\nsecure but still pale, for every winter's evening just as surely as they\r\nrise above the horizon, up comes Orion just a little way behind\r\nand pursues the Bull across the heavens with his dogs and club.\r\n\r\nÆschylus, however, claims that the Pleiades were named after the\r\ndaughters of Atlas because of their touching sorrow when their father\r\nwas laden with the weight of the sky. Thus many of the stories of\r\nOrion's adventures seem to conflict with other fables. Since the stars\r\nof the Pleiades bear the individual names of seven of Atlas's daughters,\r\nÆschylus was probably right. The stars outlining the face of Taurus\r\nwere named after the half-sisters of the Pleiades and are called the\r\nHyades.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYADES\r\n\r\n[Figure 121]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group of five stars which deck the face of the mythological Bull\r\nhave the individual names of Phaola, Ambrosia, Eudora, Coronis and\r\nPholyxo. However these names are rarely, if ever, used and the bright\r\nred star at the top of the V is generally known as Aldebaran, the name\r\ngiven it by the Arabian astronomers.\r\n\r\nDuring ancient times there was a certain amount of ill-feeling directed\r\ntoward the Hyades, just as in the case of the \"mad stars\" in Auriga, for\r\nit was thought that since this group of stars rose in November when the\r\nstormy weather usually began they exerted an unsettling influence on the\r\natmosphere, which caused rain. The word itself is derived from the Greek\r\nword meaning rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\r\n    Vext the dim sea.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April when the Hyades set they also \"Vext the dim sea\" so by watching\r\nthese stars the ancients were forewarned when the stormy weather\r\nand rain was at hand. Hesiod, who gave the ancient world one of its most\r\nfamous poems, \"Works and Days,\" mentions that when the Hyades are near\r\nthe horizon they seem to disturb the calm of the waters and when the\r\n\"Pleiades, Hyades and Orion set, it is time to plow again. But not to go\r\nto sea!\" Aratus further warned the seamen at this point by reminding\r\nthem that only a thin plank separates the sailor from Hades.\r\n\r\nKippax remarks that the \"watery\" or \"moist\" reputation of the Hyades may\r\nbe due partly to the legend that the sisters were metamorphosed into\r\nstars for immoderately bewailing the fate of their brother Hyas who had\r\nbeen killed by a wild boar. Perhaps the sisters still think of Hyas when\r\nnear the horizon and their unrestrained tears pour in floods upon the\r\nearth. But according to another legend, the Hyades were cloud nymphs and\r\nit was their nature to be incessantly weeping.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful, rose-colored star Aldebaran, \"the eye of the Bull,\"\r\nflashes on the end of this V of stars. Like Antares, Betelgeuse and the\r\nplanet Mars, its rare and colorful light shines like a beacon among the\r\ngold and silver of more somber stars.\r\n\r\nAldebaran is a much larger sun than ours and gives 45 times as much\r\nlight. What a contrast to our sun with its sunflower shade would be this\r\none of a wild-rose pink! But the restful greens of little earth are much\r\nto be preferred, with Aldebaran a star in the heavens, 28 light years\r\naway.\r\n\r\nA little to the west and north of the star, on the tip of the southern\r\nhorn of Taurus, lies the \"Crab Nebula,\" so-called on account of its\r\nresemblance to a crab. This nebula is often mistaken for a comet. The\r\ntwo horns of the Bull reach over into the Milky Way, just below Capella.\r\n\r\nThe star group of the Hyades rises a little north of east about 12 P. M.\r\nin September. By the first of November they are all rising as early as 8\r\nP. M. and by the latter part of January are directly in the south.\r\nAt such a time, they have been picturesquely likened to a \"flock of wild\r\ngeese flying southward.\"\r\n\r\nEven so small a glass as an opera-glass will disclose a rich field of\r\nsmall stars about Taurus. These stars look as if they had been shuffled\r\nand had fallen together in interesting little groups of lights, which\r\nare very pleasing to the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLEIADES\r\n\r\n[Figure 122]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades are visible from August until May. Five of the stars in\r\nthis group may be plainly seen although most people can see six and many\r\nwith keen eyesight can see seven and even nine. The telescope reveals\r\nabout 3000 more surrounding the group which gives the appearance of\r\nmistiness in the vicinity of each star. These stars fill a space in the\r\nheavens equal to about 180 millions of millions of miles!\r\n\r\nThe five more important stars of the Pleiades lie in the form of a\r\nshort-handled dipper. This is the fourth clearly marked dipper found in\r\nthe sky--the Big Dipper, the Little Dipper, the Milk Dipper and the\r\nDipper of the Pleiades. These stars are also, with the Hyades, Præsepe,\r\nComa Berenices and the cluster on the Sword Handle of Perseus, among the\r\nfew clusters visible to the unaided eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Small is the place that holds them and singly they dimly shine.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven of the stars in the Pleiad group, named after the daughters of\r\nAtlas, are called Alcyone, Merope, Electra, Celæno, Taygeta, Maia and\r\nAsterope. Two other stars were named after the father Atlas and the\r\nmother Pleione. The Hyades and the Pleiades, or the twelve sisters which\r\nTaurus carries across the sky every winter's evening, are altogether\r\ncalled \"The Atlantides.\" Atlas, by the way, also gave his name to the\r\nsecond largest body of water on earth, the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 123: NEBULOSITY IN THE PLEIADES.\r\nPhotograph by Yerkes Observatory through the 40-inch refracting\r\ntelescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the Pleiad group may be seen from every civilized country in the\r\nworld, the stars have a host of legends, songs and stories twined about\r\nthem. One idea, however, has run like a herald through all these widely\r\nseparated countries and that is that one of the stars of the Pleiades\r\nwas lost and that there were originally seven bright stars.\r\n\r\n[Figure 124: The \"Little Dipper of the Pleiades.\"]\r\n\r\nAlthough it is generally agreed that one of the Pleiads was lost,\r\nopinions seem to differ as to whether it was Electra or Merope as these\r\ntwo sisters had earthly reasons for sorrow; Merope, for instance, hiding\r\nembarrassed because she had married a mortal when all of her sisters had\r\nmarried gods. Another legend claims that it was Pleione, mother of the\r\nseven sisters, who was lost. Pickering, taking a practical view,\r\nbelieves that the true \"Lost Pleiad\" was Pleione, for the spectroscope\r\nreveals her star to be a variable star.\r\n\r\nTo the ancient people of Greece who taught even their children how to\r\ntell the time of the day by the position of the sun and what to do\r\nwhen certain stars rose and set, it would have been unpardonable not to\r\nhave known the Pleiades. They thought that the gods had set the stars in\r\nthe sky to keep the people from living in confusion. Thus Jupiter tells\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    \"when the land\r\n    Must be upturned by ploughshare or by spade--\r\n    What time to plant the olive or the vine--\r\n    What time to fling on earth the golden grain.\r\n    For He it was who scattered o'er the sky\r\n    The shining stars, and fixed them where they are--\r\n    Provided constellations through the year,\r\n    To mark the seasons in their changeless course.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Aratus._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmer and the sailor, especially, watched the rising and\r\nthe setting of the stars and abided by the advice in Hesiod's\r\n\"Works and Days\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\"when the snail, in fear of the Pleiades, climbs up the young plants,\r\nsharpen your sickle for the harvest--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At the rising of the Atlas-born Pleiades begin harvesting but\r\nplowing when they set.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"When Atlas-born, the Pleiad stars arise\r\n    Before the sun above the dawning skies,\r\n    'Tis time to reap; and when they sink below\r\n    The mom-illumined west, 'tis time to sow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rising of Orion an hour and a half later was also a sign from heaven\r\nthat the season for threshing had arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Forget not when Orion first appears\r\n    To make your servants thresh the sacred ears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when the giant is in midheaven it is time for vintage. At this time\r\nOrion has backed the Bull pretty far over in the west and the\r\nGreeks watch the frightened Pleiades drop into the sea. It is now a\r\ndangerous time for small crafts to venture forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the Pleiades, fleeing the mighty strength of Orion, fall into\r\nthe murky sea\"\r\n\r\n\r\nmake the boats secure for the sailing season is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The Pleiads and Hiads make the seasons,\r\n    The Dogstarre maketh the heat of Sommer.\"\r\n\r\n                   --1507, _Golding De Mornay._\r\n\r\n\r\nYet the people around the Mediterranean were not the only ones who\r\nconsidered the importance of these stars. Spence in \"Myths of Mexico and\r\nPeru\" tells with what trepidation the ancient Mexican people watched,\r\nevery period of 52 years, the passage of these stars across the zenith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With the conclusion of each period of fifty-two years a terrible dread\r\ncame upon the Mexicans that the world would come to an end. A stated\r\nperiod of time had expired, a period which was regarded as fixed by\r\ndivine command, and it had been ordained that on the completion of one\r\nof those series of fifty-two years earthly time would cease and the\r\nuniverse be demolished. The Mexicans then abandoned themselves to utmost\r\nprostration and the wicked went about in terrible fear. As the first day\r\nof the fifty-third year dawned the people narrowly observed the\r\nPleiades, for if they passed the zenith, time would proceed and the\r\nworld would become respited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reason for periodical recurrence of this fear lay in the old\r\nMexican tradition that the world was once destroyed when the Pleiades\r\nculminated at midnight.\r\n\r\nPoets in all lands have sung the praises of the Pleiad stars. Probably\r\nthe most quoted are those from Tennyson's \"Locksley Hall.\" These are so\r\ntruly beautiful that one almost involuntarily repeats them whenever the\r\nhuge giant Orion or this lovely star group comes into view.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest\r\n    Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the west.\r\n\r\n   \"Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising through the mellow shade,\r\n    Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Bayard Taylor speaks of\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The stars that once were mortal in their love,\r\n    And by their love are made immortal now,\r\n    Cluster like golden bees upon thy mane.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poets, with their magic words, make the stars seem close to us,\r\ndespite the fact that science tells us that the Pleiades, for instance,\r\nlie so far away in space that it takes 200 years for their light to\r\nreach the earth.\r\n\r\nSince December, when Orion and Taurus are at their best, is the month of\r\nbeautiful stars, let us look around the heavens and see how many of them\r\nwe are able to recognize.\r\n\r\nFrom the far northeast to the far northwest, passing just a little north\r\nof the zenith, the Milky Way stretches in one continuous line of\r\nsplendor. Up and down the heavenly vault, hundreds of diamond-like\r\nlittle stars glitter like gleams from pinholes in heaven, while the\r\nlarge stars hang down through the cold, black nights almost within\r\nreaching distance. One may now count ten brilliant stars of the first\r\nmagnitude, but the configuration of stars which forms the constellation\r\nof Orion and the peerless Dog Star, Sirius, are the stars which hold the\r\neye. Watch the Dog Star rise in the east about 9 o'clock during the\r\nfirst part of December or about 8 o'clock later in the month. If all the\r\nother stars burn like wind-enflamed jewels, Sirius sputters and sparkles\r\nlike a bonfire of Jupiter's lightning rods.\r\n\r\nAcross the Milky Way from Sirius, the yellow star Procyon, the head-star\r\non the Little Dog, is also appearing, while in the west, two large stars\r\nare setting, the scene being almost duplicated. Thus, paraphrasing\r\nthe words of the ancient poet Aratus, \"when the Dogs appear in the east,\r\nthe Birds set in the west.\"\r\n\r\nAbove Procyon, and on the same side of the Milky Way, shine Castor and\r\nPollux, the Heavenly Twins, seemingly with an eye on the battle of the\r\nGiant and the red-eyed Bull; above the Bull's horns glows Capella,\r\nalways an attractive star but not as radiant when near the meridian as\r\nwhen rising in the east. This is also true of Cassiopeia's Chair, now in\r\nthe zenith, and of the Segment of Perseus, the Chain of Andromeda and\r\nthe Square of Pegasus, which lie just below her.\r\n[Figure 125: The December Sky.]\r\nThe Cross is now descending in the west, closely following Vega and\r\nAltair, while low in the southwest, Formalhaut is just about to\r\ndisappear below our view. The North Star shines, as always, in its fixed\r\nplace in the sky, but Ursa Minor now hangs perilously by the tip of his\r\ntail with nothing between him and the northern horizon but the\r\nstraggling form of Draco and the brightly decorated tail of Ursa Major.\r\nUrsa Major is just about ready to climb the eastern slope and patiently\r\ncontinue on his endless circle around the pole. Along the southern\r\nhorizon, the stars are faint, for here lies Cetus, the dark-sided\r\nSea-monster, and the glints on the river Eridanus which rolls down to\r\nthe 'Sea.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTOR AND POLLUX\r\n\r\n[Figure 126]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to legendary history, Castor and Pollux were the sons of Leda\r\nand the brothers of Helen of Troy. These twins were noted near and far\r\nfor their bravery and had divine honors paid to them both in Sparta and\r\nin Rome. Their boyhood days were spent on Mount Pelion under the\r\nguidance of the wise centaur Chiron, but they spent most of their\r\nmanhood adventuring, one of their best known exploits being the journey\r\nafter the Golden Fleece on the ship Argo. During this journey a great\r\nstorm arose and the frail little bark, whose only power was its fifty\r\noars and the strong arms of the heroes, was tossed about like a shell.\r\nOrpheus, with his magic harp, sought to calm the waters and soothe the\r\nfears of the oarsmen, and had just about succeeded when two stars\r\nsuddenly shone above the heads of the twins. This, of course, was static\r\nelectricity, which sometimes appears like two stars of light attaching\r\nitself to each mast, but the Greeks considered it a sign from Jupiter\r\nthat all was well and that there was nothing to fear from the storm. The\r\nArgo went on in safety, and ever after lights at the mastheads were\r\ncalled \"Castor and Pollux\" and sailors predict fair weather from their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Greeks called them Castor and Pollux--which some call Hermes fire;\r\nSaint Elmo others.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Sir T. Herbert._\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, but one light is seen. This is then called \"Helena,\"\r\nafter their sister, and is regarded as foreboding a storm.\r\n\r\nAs a reward for their great affection (for the twins even shared their\r\nimmortality together since only one was immortal), Jupiter placed them\r\namong the stars under the name of Gemini, and the two bright stars in\r\nthis constellation were placed upon their brows. Sailors love these\r\nstars for they are well above the eastern horizon during the first part\r\nof January and are visible during the remainder of the stormy season of\r\nthe year. They watch them and know that if both stars are visible at the\r\nsame time, the weather is clearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Thus the twins, indulgent save\r\n    The shatter'd vessel from the wave.\"\r\n\r\n                   --_Idyllium_ XXII (FAWKE'S _Trans._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the storm continues to rage and the stars remain hidden behind\r\nthe clouds\r\n\r\n\r\n                             \"sailors trembling\r\n    Call on the twins of Jove with prayer and vow.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Shelley._\r\n\r\n\r\nGemini, the constellation of the Twins, lies near the stream of the\r\nMilky Way, just above Procyon, below Capella, and in front of Leo, the\r\nLion. The feet of the Twins are among the stars at the edge of the\r\nstream, while their heads extend northeast, in the same general\r\ndirection as the horns of Taurus, the Bull, which are thrust into the\r\nstream on the other side. The Twins have no connection with the story of\r\nOrion and the Bull, although their constellation is so situated that one\r\nmight consider them as interested spectators.\r\n\r\nThe stars on the brows of the Twins are not exactly twin stars for one\r\nis brighter than the other and, although they look much alike to the\r\nunaided eye, a telescope reveals their delicate colors. The star on\r\nPollux is then seen to be a pale orange while that on Castor is a\r\ngreenish-white. Pollux is also a triple star, described by one\r\nobserver as \"pale orange, lilac and gray.\" Castor is equally\r\ninteresting, for a 3-inch telescope resolves it into two brilliant\r\nstars.\r\n[Figure 127]\r\nThe spectroscope, making further discoveries, disclosed the fact that a\r\ncompanion whirls around the fainter component, completing its orbit in 3\r\ndays, while the brighter component also has a companion which completes\r\nits orbit in 9 days. These four stars, which form the star we call\r\nCastor, revolve in pairs about a common center of gravity, completing\r\ntheir period in about 900 years.\r\n\r\nThe Heavenly Twins claim a unique distinction--that of having a planet\r\nfound at their feet; Sir William Herschel, an English astronomer, has\r\nthe equally unique distinction of having found the planet. This planet\r\nwas surely an odd and interesting thing for a mortal to discover for it\r\nis not only a gaseous globe 32,000 miles in diameter, but its pole\r\npoints almost at the sun at one time in its 84-year journey, causing it\r\nto have 42 years of daylight and 42 years of night! This was the first\r\nplanet added to the five known since antiquity and its discovery was a\r\njoyful surprise. The boundary line of the solar system was now greatly\r\nincreased for Uranus travels in an orbit which lies at an average\r\ndistance of 1,771,000,000 miles from the sun. In accordance with the\r\nancient custom of naming the planets after the immortals on Mount\r\nOlympus, the planet was named Uranus, after the God of the starry sky.\r\n\r\nA wonderful star cluster was later discovered also at the feet of the\r\nTwins,--a little northwest of the feet of Castor. This is designated at\r\n34M on star-maps and may be located in the sky even with a field-glass.\r\n\r\nCastor and Pollux may be found a little south of the zenith during the\r\nevenings of February and March. Castor, which is the higher star, passes\r\nthe meridian first, but Pollux, the brighter star, passes it 11\r\nminutes later. They are sometimes called \"Ledæan lights\" in honor of\r\nLeda, their mother. Owen Meredith in \"The Wanderer\" says\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The lone Ledæan lights from yon enchanted air,\r\n    Look down upon my spirit like spirit's eyes that love me.\"\r\n\r\n[Figure 128]\r\n\r\nBecause of their nearness and similarity to one another, old English\r\npeople sometimes call them the \"Giant's Eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now covered the most important constellations and have seen that\r\na little knowledge of romance, beauty, story and fact add wonderfully to\r\nthe spectacle of a heaven filled with stars. The thrill of rediscovery\r\nis for every individual who learns a little science; the romance and\r\nbeauty for every heart which feels a little song.\r\n\r\nFrom an open plain, the boundless sea, or the solitude of a mountain,\r\nthe stars seem to hold their greatest appeal. If one knows the\r\nname of a star or two, one will find, as in \"The Wanderer,\" a\r\ncomradeship that is comforting.\r\n\r\n[Figure 129: Relative positions of the constellations \"grouped about the\r\npole,\" those appearing in \"the story of Andromeda,\" the \"Spring and\r\nSummer Pageant,\" and the \"story of Orion and Taurus, the Bull.\"]\r\n\r\nBayard Taylor, who often wrote about the stars, looked up, in a foreign\r\nland, and saw \"Above the palms, the peaks of pearly gray,\" Canopus, a\r\nstar of the southern hemisphere, only surpassed by Sirius.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"An urn of light, a golden-hearted torch,\r\n    Voluptuous, drowsy-throbbing mid the stars,\r\n    As, incense-fed, from Aphrodite's porch\r\n    Lifted to beacon Mars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Ah, bliss to lie beside the jasper urn\r\n    Of founts, and through the open arabesque\r\n    To watch Canopus burn!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us face the heavens and dream for a moment, forget the earth--let\r\nit drop away--just drift and dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Ring out, ye crystal spheres!\r\n    Once bless our human ears\r\n      (If ye have power to charm our senses so;)\r\n    And let your silver chime\r\n    Move in melodious time,\r\n      (And let the base of Heaven's deep organ blow;)\r\n    And with your ninefold harmony\r\n    Make up full concert with angelic symphony.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nHow rapturously the poets have dwelt upon the music of the crystalline\r\nspheres! How sad that the volume of it was so excessive that the ear\r\ncould not hear it! And great it must have been with the whirr of a globe\r\nso huge that it contained eight concentric crystalline spheres whirling\r\naround every twenty-four hours and resounding with the stars as they\r\nrolled in their orbits.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the crystal spheres of ancient astronomy was beautifully\r\ndescribed by Milton in \"Paradise Lost.\" Milton believed without a doubt\r\nin the theories of Copernicus who taught that the sun was a center of a\r\nsystem of planets which revolved about it at various distances, but he\r\nprobably used this old conception of the universe because it gave him\r\nmore artistic freedom in the writing of his great epic poem. Let us\r\npursue this fascinating theme, while drifting and dreaming, and see in\r\nwhat way the great poet painted it in as a background for his story.\r\n\r\nMilton pictured the boundless cosmos as divided into two parts--the\r\n\"resplendent Kingdom of Heaven\" which rested in brightness above, and\r\nthe \"turbulent darkness of Chaos\" which surged in blackness below. Our\r\n\"cheerful sun-illumined Universe\" was thought to be contained in an\r\nopaque sphere which hung from the floor of Heaven by a golden chain. At\r\nthe rebellion of Satan and his rebel followers, God hurled them\r\nthrough the floor of Heaven and down through the darkness of\r\nimmeasurable space to a place in Chaos hollowed out to receive them.\r\nThis place contained such dire discomforts that Satan in his wrath swore\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nSatan had heard that in order to hollow out this awful place in Chaos,\r\nthe ether, which was believed to fill all space, flew upward\r\n\r\n\r\n              \"spirited with various forms,\r\n    That rowl'd orbicular, and turned to starrs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nthe stars walling-in a Universe which was to contain a dwelling place\r\nfor a new race which might eventually take the place of the rebels cast\r\nfrom Heaven. The stars were then surrounded by a translucent shell which\r\nprotected this new creation from the cold and tempests of outer space.\r\n\r\nSatan searched long and ardently through the darkness for this splendid\r\nball of light. Finally he found it, hanging on its golden chain from\r\nHeaven, and, descending within by the radiant stairway of the angels,\r\npassed the stars and the planets in their sliding spheres of impalpable\r\ncrystal, and discovered the earth, radiant in the brightness of the sun!\r\nOf the further adventures of Satan we need not speak, but the handling\r\nof the whole subject is masterly and brought to Milton undying fame.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the crystalline spheres first came to Eudoxus in the 4th\r\ncentury B. C. from watching the movements of the planets among the stars.\r\nHe imagined that there must be nine of these hollow, transparent globes\r\nenclosed one within the other and surrounding the quiescent body of the\r\nearth; first, the \"primum mobile,\" which carried around all the inner\r\nspheres and communicated to them a universal motion, next a sphere for\r\nall the stars, then one for the sun, one for the moon, and one for each\r\nof the five planets then known. These spheres were conceived to be of\r\nthe finest crystal, for past the wandering stars or planets, the\r\nlight came penetrating from that distant sphere studded with stars.\r\n\r\nThe daily movements of these stars were watched as they were carried\r\nalong on their spheres, and it was seen that they moved in law and\r\norder. Noting that the planets seemed to be placed at intervals\r\ncorresponding to the scale in music and being at the same time greatly\r\nimpressed with the discovery that music was based on mathematics, he\r\nbeautifully combined these discoveries and arrived at the entrancing\r\nconclusion that so great and orderly a movement of so many crystal\r\nspheres must give forth strains which united in a wonderful harmony of\r\nincredible volume and sweetness. The picture is enchanting--a beautiful\r\nworld set in the midst of whirling, star-gemmed, crystalline globes,\r\nwhich by their motion, create a melody so divine that it may only be\r\nheard by the gods!\r\n\r\nWith the advent of modern science, our thoughts now wing their way\r\nthrough unobstructed star spaces of once crystalline spheres, to the\r\ngreat space beyond, and find in the void of what the ancients termed\r\n\"chaos,\" not one \"sun-illuminated\" universe but millions of them, some\r\nso distant that they appear no more than a filmy mist on a petal or a\r\nghost of a fairy cloud!\r\n\r\nTo the true lover of the stars, one universe or a million makes not a\r\nwhit of difference. The silent song of the heavens is as sweet today,\r\nits mystery as alluring, its delights more marvelous, than in the days\r\nof yore when planets rolled out heavenly notes and stars shone through\r\nthe seven spheres of pure, translucent crystal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nALONG THE MILKY WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILKY WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nONE of the loveliest, and most amazing, phenomena of the heavens is the\r\nMilky Way. In olden times, imagination ran riot as to just what this\r\nluminous band of light could be. It was almost as great a mystery as the\r\ntides, which were called the \"grave of curiosity.\"\r\n\r\nFully equal to solving the problem to their own satisfaction, even as\r\nthey did the motion of the stars, the ancient people considered that\r\nhere, perhaps, was a crack or seam where the two halves of heaven were\r\nimperfectly joined thus giving to earth a glimpse of the glory beyond\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Whether the skies grown old here shrink their frame,\r\n    And through the chinks admit an upper Flame,\r\n    Or whether here the heaven's two Halves are joyn'd,\r\n    But oddly clos'd, still leave a Seam behind.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Manilius._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ancient Judea it was imagined as a Long Bandage wrapped around the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nOthers thought that the Milky Way was not an imperfection in the floor\r\nof heaven but a pathway left open for the angels. A French legend has it\r\nthe glimmering of lights held by angels to guide mortals on their way to\r\nheaven. Some of the tribes of American Indians have a legend somewhat\r\nlike the French legend for they, too, thought that it was a road on\r\nwhich souls journeyed to their \"happy hunting ground.\" The large stars,\r\non either side of the road, were camp fires which cheered and\r\nwarmed the travelers on their way.\r\n\r\nAristotle imagined that this misty arch of light was the result of\r\ngaseous exhalations which had risen from the earth and now rested\r\nbetween the region of the ether and that of the planets.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The stars, and Sun himself, as some have said\r\n    By exhalations from the deep are fed.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Lucan's Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n\r\nPosidonious thought that it was a compound of fire less dense than that\r\nof the stars but more luminous. Still others fancifully considered it to\r\nbe the course of the sun-chariot after Phæthon had lost control of his\r\nhorses and that along here were the imprints of the hot hoofs and the\r\nruts scorched by the fiery wheels.\r\n\r\nA more modern legend of Swedish origin tells of the construction of the\r\nMilky Way by two lovers who were mourning for each other on separate\r\nstars. After toiling a thousand years they built this \"bridge of starry\r\nlight\" which spanned the space between the two stars and enabled them to\r\nonce more be united.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"And now Salami and Zulamith, when this long toil was done,\r\n    Straight rushed into each other's arms, and melted into one.\r\n    So they became the brightest star in heaven's high arch that dwelt,\r\n    Great Sirius, the mighty sun, beneath Orion's belt.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Topelius._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, Japanese and Koreans thought of the Milky Way as a river.\r\nAn ancient tale, current in these countries, connects this \"river\" and\r\nthe constellations of Lyra and Aquila in the quaint and charming romance\r\nof two lovers who were so happily married that they could not bear to be\r\nseparated. As a result, they neglected their duties to such an extent\r\nthat the God of the Firmament placed the bride on a constellation on one\r\nside of the celestial river and her husband on a constellation on\r\nthe other side. \"Now,\" said he, \"on the 7th night of the 7th month you\r\nmay meet--if you are able.\" This date occurs during the summer-time, in\r\nJuly, at a time of the year when the Milky Way and these stars are well\r\nplaced for observation, and, on a clear night anyone with a keen eye and\r\nan open mind may witness a remarkable thing happen. Every magpie in\r\nsight flies upward, higher than it ever flew before, up to the very\r\nfields of heaven where the Milky River wends its way.\r\n[Figure 130]\r\nRanging themselves side by side, the birds make a bridge of their bodies\r\nand wings which spans the celestial river and solves the problem of how\r\nthe lovers shall meet. On this happy night, the stars of Lyra and Aquila\r\nburn with five different colors. If, however, the weather is stormy and\r\nrain falls, the river rises and flows over the plains and all the\r\nmagpies in China, Korea and Japan cannot reach across it. The children\r\nof Korea stone every magpie they see loitering around its usual haunts,\r\nto remind it of its duty.\r\n\r\nLafcadio Hearn, who wrote the Japanese version of this story in a\r\nmost delightful way, said it seemed to be the origin of a festival\r\ncalled Tanabata. During this festival the Japanese write poems with dew\r\n\"from the River of Heaven,\" which is collected fresh from yam leaves.\r\nThese poems are written on strips of blue, green, red, yellow and white\r\npaper to match the colors of the stars, and are tied on bamboo stalks\r\nset up about the houses. Mr. Hearn in his \"Romance of the Milky Way\"\r\nrefers to the story in this exquisite manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the silence of the transparent night, before the rising of the moon,\r\nthe charm of the ancient tale sometimes descends upon me out of the\r\nscintillant sky, to make me forget the monstrous facts of science and\r\nthe stupendous horror of space. Then I no longer behold the Milky Way, as\r\nthat awful Ring of Cosmos, whose hundred million suns are powerless to\r\nlighten the abyss, but as the very Amanogwa itself--the river\r\nCelestial. I see the thrill of its shining stream, the mists that hover\r\nalong the verge, and the watergrasses that bend in the winds of autumn.\r\nWhite Orihime I see at her starry loom and the Ox that grazes on the\r\nfarther shore--and I know that the falling dew is the spray of the\r\nHerdsman's oar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are any number of references to the Milky Way throughout the\r\nrealms of poetry. Amelia describes it as\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"a fair illumined path\r\n    That leadeth upward to the gate of heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMilton--an\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"ample road whose dust is gold\r\n    And pavement stars as stars to thee appear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOvid--a \"high-road\" \"whose groundwork is of stars\":\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"A way there is, in heaven's expanded plain,\r\n    Which, when the skies are clear, is seen below,\r\n    And mortals, by the name of Milky, know.\r\n    The ground work is of stars; through which the road\r\n    Lies open to the Thunderer's abode.\"\r\n\r\n                   --_Ovid's Metamorphoses_ (DRYDEN'S _Trans._)\r\n\r\n\r\nChaucer calls it \"Watling street\":\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Lo,\" quoth he, \"cast up thine eye,\r\n    See yonder, lo! the galaxie,\r\n    The which men clepe the Milky Way\r\n    For it is white; and some parfay\r\n    Callen it Watling streete.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis great street was \"brent with hete,\" he goes on to say, when the\r\n\"Sunne's sonne\" lost control of the sun-chariot, \"that he could no\r\ngovernaunce.\" In Germany this same street was called \"Irmin's Way,\" for\r\nthe Saxon God Irmin was believed to ride along here in a ponderous\r\nbrazen chariot now seen in the constellation of the Great Bear.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 Galileo, the distinguished Italian astronomer, turned his newly\r\ninvented telescope toward this mysterious illuminated arch, and saw, to\r\nhis delight, that it was a \"track of countless stars.\" This fact, which\r\nhe proclaimed to the world, has even more lure for the imaginative mind\r\nthan a \"road whose dust is gold.\" A modern poet describes it as\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Infinity's illimitable fields where bloom\r\n    the worlds like flowers about God's feet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the cold glass eye of the telescope does not, like the eye of the\r\nMedusa, turn a singing heart into stone. Some of the early writers, such\r\nas Ovid, evidently suspected that the Milky Way consisted of millions of\r\ndistant stars, but the suggestion did not take well with the mass of\r\npeople who preferred the belief that it was a radiant stairway used by\r\nthe angels.\r\n\r\nThe \"silvery glow,\" which is such an attractive feature of the star\r\nstream, is caused by the accumulated light of a dazzling torrent of\r\nstars. These stars, or suns, are so unthinkably distant that their\r\nindividuality is lost like particles of mist, thus causing the\r\nbright faces of Sirius, Capella and other great stars to seem suddenly\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThis path of stars, called the Milky Way, stretches entirely around the\r\nsky, or seems to do so, because our solar system rests almost within its\r\ncenter--\"almost\" meaning within about 60,000 light years, which is\r\ncomparatively close to the center of a Galaxy some 300,000 light years\r\nin diameter. If we could step off the earth and look at these stars they\r\nwould appear as a gigantic wreath; as it is, we see one half of the\r\nwreath from the northern hemisphere and the other half by traveling to\r\nthe southern hemisphere. At least this much of the ancient conception of\r\nthe universe was correct--that our earth was situated near its\r\ncenter--but the idea that the sun, moon and stars whirled around it for\r\nits particular benefit, is looked upon as a vast conceit.\r\n\r\nWe now know for a certainty that our glorious Galaxy of stars is itself\r\nbut an item in space, for since the recent investigations with the\r\n60- and the 100-inch telescopes at Mount Wilson observatory with which the\r\nouter portions of the spiral nebulæ were resolved into swarms of stars,\r\nwe know that there are hundreds of thousands of Galaxies separated from\r\nours by a million light years, and from one another equally far.\r\nProbably the smaller nebulæ are even more remote. And we used to\r\nimagine that our own Galaxy floated through an infinite void of\r\nboundless space as lorn and lonely as Wordsworth's \"cloud\"! Then science\r\ngoes still further and wonders if all these Galaxies form a part of a\r\nstarry region which extends indefinitely in all directions or whether\r\nthe star producing region is limited and surrounded by empty space!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The eagle flying in the face of the sun is as naught to the audacity of\r\nman poised on a speck in space, marshalling the heavenly host about him\r\nand calling them by name across an abyss of space that may take years,\r\nhundreds of years, thousands and possibly millions of years for light to\r\ncross.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_J. R. Collins._\r\n\r\n\r\nOur thoughts, now half stunned, fly back across unthinkable\r\nstarless intervals, back like a magnet to the phosphorescent gleam\r\nwhich is ours in the boundless ocean in which a universe is but a\r\ngleam. Nearer--nearer--nearer--the gleam has softened to a\r\ntouch of mist, the mist has expanded to a definite shape studded\r\nwith stars which are brightening, and widening apart. Now the\r\nshape has become an ethereal form, and before us rises a marvelous\r\ncreation. As seen from this outer point, our Galaxy is neither a\r\nring nor a wreath but is formed of huge spirals which reach far\r\noutward into the heavens. This cathedral of light, whose \"lace-work\"\r\nis of suns, covers an area so magnificent that a beam of\r\nlight traveling 6,000,000,000,000 miles a year would require some\r\n300,000 years to cross it! Around a modest, medium-sized star\r\nin the central cluster of this overwhelming and heroic structure,\r\nwhirls a tiny planet named Earth, and on this Earth, the infinitesimal\r\nhuman being named Man, whose questioning mind thus flies\r\nfrom star to star.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         \"Round\r\n    That world of worlds His arm the Almighty wound;\r\n    The bright immensity He raised, and pressed,\r\n    All trembling, like a babe, unto His breast.\r\n\r\n    Think ye that I, who thus do ye maintain;\r\n    Thus always cherish ye, or all were vain--\r\n    Ye all would drop into your native void,\r\n    If by my hand ye were not held and buoyed.\r\n\r\n                             --with God, 'tis one\r\n    To guide a sunbeam or create a sun--\r\n    To rule ten thousand thousand worlds or none.\r\n    Go, worlds! said God, but learn, ere ye depart,\r\n    My favored temple is an human heart;\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Festus_, _Philip James Bailey._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO CROSSES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Northern Cross, the Milky Way divides into two large\r\nchannels which are quite irregular along the edges. These two channels\r\ndo not unite again for a distance of 150 degrees, which leads us around\r\nto the southern hemisphere. As seen from the southern hemisphere, one of\r\nthese divisions is particularly bright, while the other is not only\r\nfainter but looks as if its streams of stars had encountered obstacles\r\nalong their pathway and had been forced to run up little rills along its\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nOn the Milky Way in the southern hemisphere, is the famous Southern\r\nCross.\r\n[Figure 131]\r\nThis Cross contains four bright stars set close together, one of the\r\nfirst magnitude, two of the second magnitude, and one of the third\r\nmagnitude. Although its figure is not quite so large nor as perfect as\r\nthat of the Northern Cross, its stars are brighter and it holds a\r\nprominent position near the southern pole. In the first maps of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, South America is designated as \"Terra sancti\r\ncrucis,\" the land of the holy cross. When Vega is our Pole Star, the\r\nNorthern Cross will hold a prominent position near the northern pole.\r\n\r\nNear the Southern Cross, as is the case near the Northern Cross, lies a\r\nremarkable dark blot which stands out sharply against the silvery path\r\nof the Milky Way. This dark body is 130 times larger than the area of\r\nthe full moon and is much more impressive than the one seen in the\r\nnorth. It is said that superstitious sailors used to shudder and cross\r\nthemselves because it lay so close to the Cross, but in those days, dark\r\nnebulæ were thought to be holes in the heavens and the combination was\r\nsuggestive of what happened to sailors who were good, or who failed to\r\nbe good.\r\n\r\nNot far from the Southern Cross is a telescopic treasure which has long\r\nbeen enjoyed by astronomers. This treasure is a cluster of colored stars\r\nso delicately beautiful that the loveliest of rubies, emeralds and\r\nsapphires seem to have been filled with fire and turned to stars. There\r\nare over a hundred of these sparkling jewels in a space of only one\r\nforty-eighth of a square degree. What a delight it would be to suddenly\r\nuncover such a wonderful casket in our treasure hunt among the stars!\r\nBut imagine the pleasure in watching the sky from the surface of a\r\nplanet swinging in a field of such stars. Quite a thrill was experienced\r\nat the thought of a daytime tinted by a colored sun, or even two colored\r\nsuns, but now imagine a night-time adorned with large and glowing pink,\r\ngreen, orange, red and yellow stars!\r\n\r\n\r\n         \"their skies flowered with stars,\r\n    Violet, rose, or pearl-hued or soft blue,\r\n    Golden or green, the light now blended, now\r\n    Alternate.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Bailey._\r\n\r\n\r\nJust below the Southern Cross lie two stars which outrival the twin\r\nstars of Castor and Pollux.\r\n\r\n[Figure 132: The two pointers on the forefeet of Centaurus,\r\nthe Centaur, and the Southern Cross.]\r\n\r\nThese two stars are often called the \"southern pointers\" because they \r\npoint out the Southern Cross. They belong to the constellation of the \r\nCentaur, Alpha Centauri being noted as lying closer to the earth than \r\nany other star. The light we call Alpha Centauri comes from two suns \r\ninstead of one. These suns are separated from each other by a distance \r\nof 2,000 million miles and gravitate one round the other in a time \r\nequalling 81 of our years. \r\n\r\nAbove the Cross shines Canopus on the stern of Argo, the ship of\r\nthe Argonauts. Canopus ranks next to Sirius in brightness. The bright\r\nstars of Orion and the Scorpion are each in their season seen high in\r\nthe sky. Thus the appearance of the heavens would seem quite strange to\r\none who had come from the north.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGELLANIC CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Magellanic Clouds, which are almost as famous as the Southern Cross,\r\nlie to one side of the Milky Way, as seen by persons south of the\r\nequator, but they have no apparent connection with our Galaxy of stars.\r\nThe \"clouds\" resemble the Milky Way and are easily discernible with the\r\nunaided eye, the larger one being 200 times the apparent size of the\r\nmoon--about as large as the bowl of the Big Dipper--and the smaller\r\none-fourth as large.\r\n\r\nPhotographs reveal the large Magellanic Cloud as being composed of\r\nnebulæ, individual stars and star clusters, the stars ranging from the\r\nfifth to the fifteenth magnitude. Flammarion counted 291 distinct\r\nnebulæ, 46 clusters and 582 stars. Herschel counted several hundred\r\nnebulæ and clusters \"which far exceeds anything that is to be met with\r\nin any other region of the heavens.\" Dr. Harlow Shapley, director of the\r\nHarvard Observatory, found the linear diameter of the cloud to be 15,000\r\nlight years, and that it lay at such an immense distance that it\r\nrequired 110,000 years for its light to reach us. This cloud is like a\r\nsmall universe in itself, although many of its stars are anything but\r\nsmall for Dr. Shapley found that hundreds of them exceed the brightness\r\nof the sun by 10,000 times.\r\n\r\nThe large Magellanic Cloud lies between the southern pole and Canopus;\r\nthe smaller one between Beta Centauri and the pole. These starry clouds,\r\nwhich look so much like real clouds, were named after the celebrated\r\nnavigator, Magellan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nOUR NEAREST STAR--THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS are suns which lie at such vast distances that they seem no more\r\nthan twinkling points of light. Through the aid of the spectroscope we\r\nhave learned a great deal about these stars but so distant do they lie\r\nthat no telescope on earth can bring them close enough for us to see the\r\noutline of a face.\r\n\r\nThere is one star, however, that lies so near that when it is in the sky\r\nits light blots out that of all the other stars. This sun, which classic\r\npoets call our \"day star,\" lies only 93,000,000 miles away; the next\r\nnearest star is over 200,000 times as far. This distance of 93,000,000\r\nmiles is close enough to enable us to examine the face of such a star as\r\nours with comparative ease, indeed, it is close enough to enable us to\r\nfeel the warmth of the fierce fires which rage upon its surface.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all a difficult matter to realize the distance from our\r\nearth to the sun. A train traveling 60 miles an hour would reach the sun\r\nin 176 years; an airplane flying at the rate of 200 miles an hour would\r\nreach it in 50 years. Thus the distance seems to shrink as we adjust our\r\nrate of speed. A ray of light crosses the same space in about 8 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe existence of all life upon the earth is absolutely dependent upon\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is perceived that the sun of the world, with all its essence, which\r\nis heat and light, flows into every tree, and every shrub and flower,\r\nand into every stone, mean as well as precious.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Swedenborg._\r\n\r\n\r\nEqually dependent are the seven other planets which, with the earth,\r\nwhirl in elliptical orbits about this source of heat and light.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The Sun the seasons of the year supplies\r\n    And bids the evening and the morning rise;\r\n    Commands the planets with superior force,\r\n    And keeps each wandering light to his appointed course.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Lucan's Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planets are sometimes called the \"family\" of the sun, although his\r\nfamily also includes the retinue of each planet, which in the case of\r\nsix of them at least, consists of from one to ten moons. Our sun is no\r\ndifferent than thousands of other stars in the sky; is it likely that\r\nour star alone of all the countless millions which shine in our\r\nuniverse, should be the only one to possess this additional charm of\r\nmaturity? One looks far out in the darkness to the hosts of radiant\r\nstars--then wonders--how many stars have flocks of planets--how many\r\ntravel alone?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURFACE OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nCompared to a point of starlight, the disk of our \"day star\" looks most\r\nexceedingly huge, and this at a distance of 93,000,000 miles. One is\r\ntherefore not quite so surprised to learn that this great sunball, which\r\nrests like the hub of a wheel in the center of the solar system, has a\r\ndiameter of 886,000 miles. The 8000 miles which measures across the\r\nearth seems quite inconspicuous when compared with such a diameter as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nCompletely covering the sun's surface is a mass of intensely hot crimson\r\ngases. These gases are like a turbulent upper atmosphere with a depth of\r\n5000 to 10,000 miles. Raging and seething in long tongues of flame, they\r\nswirl up for thousands of miles above the surface, or are thrown far\r\nabove it in titanic explosions. Formerly, these burning gases could only\r\nbe seen at the time of total eclipse when the black disc of the\r\nmoon passed in front of the glaring face of the sun leaving only the red\r\nflames licking out beyond the dark edge. The invention of the\r\nspectroheliograph now makes it possible to photograph these projections\r\nwhen the sun is shining. One should never try to see them by looking at\r\nthe sun unless the glare is shut off either by the moon or by artificial\r\nmeans, for the sun is so unbearably brilliant that the eyesight of an\r\nobserver would soon be ruined.\r\n\r\n[Figure 133: SOLAR PROMINENCES.\r\nHuge flames ejected from the surface of the sun, photographed at\r\nYerkes Observatory with the Rumford spectroheliograph attached\r\nto the 40-inch refractor.]\r\n\r\nThis colorful gas which covers the surface of the sun, is called the\r\n_chromosphere_ or color-sphere on account of the vivid color which it\r\nacquires from the hydrogen and calcium of which it is largely composed.\r\nThe colossal flames which rise above its surface are called\r\n_prominences_. Some of the prominences shoot up with a velocity ranging\r\nfrom 300 to 600 miles a second, sometimes to a height of 200,000 miles,\r\nand even higher. The largest so far recorded extended upward for 500,000\r\nmiles. Others extend horizontally for a distance of over 300,000 miles,\r\nracing forward at the rate of a thousand miles a minute, although\r\nsometimes they remain in an unchanged position above the surface of the\r\nsun for days at a time. These flames seem tremendous compared to our\r\nterrestrial standards, but they would not seem so large on the\r\nglobe of the sun which is 3,000,000 miles in circumference.\r\n\r\n[Figure 134: HYDROGEN FLAMES ON THE SURFACE OF THE SUN.\r\nPhotographed with the aid of the spectroheliograph at the Mount\r\nWilson Observatory.]\r\n\r\nIt seems strange to think that the \"tranquil stars\" must also be\r\nseething in such wild commotion,--blazing orbs torn by terrific\r\ntornadoes of fire. It is fortunate that we cannot hear the terrible roar\r\nas well as see the light of their conflagrations. Since sound waves do\r\nnot travel through space like the waves of light and heat, the\r\ntumult on even our nearest star could never reach us; yet sound is such\r\na laggard traveler compared with fleet-winged light, that light could\r\ncover the distance of 93,000,000 miles in less than 8 minutes while\r\nsound would require over 14 years to travel over the same space. Thus,\r\neven if we could hear the voices of these explosions, they would never\r\ncoincide with the scenes enacted.\r\n\r\nThe bright yellow surface of the sun which every one sees, is called the\r\n_photosphere_ or light-sphere. If strongly magnified through a\r\ntelescope, this surface is seen to have a decided \"mottled\" appearance,\r\nlike a layer of little clouds with dark spaces between, spread over the\r\nwhole face of the sun. These are now known to be masses of calcium gas.\r\n\r\nPractically all that is known of the physical constitution of the sun\r\nhas been discovered through the study of the fine, dark lines in the\r\nsolar spectrum. Through the aid of the spectroscope, many terrestrial\r\nelements have been discovered, among these being calcium, sodium,\r\nmagnesium, potassium, aluminum, silver, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin,\r\nlead, hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. All these elements are either in the\r\nform of permanent gases or metallic vapors.\r\n\r\nThe _photosphere_ or light-sphere lies below the _chromosphere_ or\r\ncolor-sphere. Beyond the crimson color-sphere lies another envelope of\r\nvery delicate light called the _corona_. This may only be seen at the\r\ntime of total eclipse. It was once thought to belong to the moon but it\r\nis now known that the moon has very little atmosphere. Besides, the\r\nmoon's black disk may be seen floating across this beautiful halo of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe corona has been described by those who have seen it, as having a\r\n\"soft, pearly radiance\" \"tinged with green\"; its form is quite irregular\r\nand varies at different times, extending from 1,000,000 to 3,000,000 and\r\nsometimes even 9,000,000 miles beyond the surface of the sun. In the\r\neclipse of 1879 the streamers were quite extensive in the\r\nequatorial plane of the sun where they united in a formation like the\r\npetals of a narcissus while at the solar poles they were shorter and\r\nextended in well-defined rays. Yet no matter what its form, it is a\r\nmagnificent background during the sun's eclipse for the narrow rim of\r\ndeep crimson projects beyond the inky edges of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe corona seems to be caused by electrical discharges in a medium of\r\nfine dust and rarefied gases, chiefly coronium and protofluorine.\r\nVarious electrical phenomena take place in the strong magnetic fields of\r\nthe sun as a whole and in the sun-spots, and the changing fields of\r\nmagnetic force cause the changing appearance of the corona.\r\n\r\nThe sun-spots, however, are of the greatest interest to amateurs for\r\nthese may often be seen with very little optical aid. These dark,\r\nmovable spots were first noted by Galileo, although the idea that the\r\nsun could have spots upon its surface was ridiculed by the scholars of\r\nthe medieval schools who argued in the fervid language of scholastic\r\nphilosophy and medieval dogmatism, that the sun was a sphere of pure\r\nfire undefiled by any spots.\r\n\r\nSun-spots are, as a rule, thousands of miles across and usually appear\r\nin groups which cover an immense area on the surface of the sun, but,\r\nsince the sun lies 93,000,000 miles away, a spot large enough to contain\r\nthe earth would appear to us about the size of a pinhead on a\r\npincushion. Right here one should be warned again not to attempt to look\r\nat the sun without adequate protection (such as smoked glasses) for the\r\neyes. A photograph taken through a large telescope is the most\r\nsatisfactory. Although these dark blotches--which are only comparatively\r\ndark--were called \"spots\" and were later drawn as saucer-like\r\ndepressions, modern research and increased power in the telescopes has\r\nrevealed them as gigantic solar tornadoes. These tornadoes usually last\r\nfrom a few days to several months, and are especially numerous in\r\ncycles of 11 years. During sun-spot activity eruptive prominences rise\r\nto heights of many thousands of miles and streams of electrons are shot\r\nforth with such force that they may possibly even penetrate deeply into\r\nour own atmosphere causing disturbances such as magnetic storms and\r\nauroras.\r\n\r\n[Figure 135: SUN-SPOTS.\r\nThe earth is so small compared with the huge bulk of the sun that\r\nit would be lost in one of these \"spots.\" Photograph by the Mount\r\nWilson Observatory.]\r\n\r\nIf a total solar eclipse occurs at a time when these great magnetic\r\nstorms are raging in particular fury on the sun's surface, the corona\r\nalways appears brighter and more intricate than when the sun is\r\npeaceful.\r\n\r\nSun-spots were very numerous in 1915 and 1916. The next spot maximum\r\nwill occur about 1926, then in 1937 and so on. For three years or four\r\nyears they appear with great frequency, then declining to a minimum for\r\nthree or four years, rise to a maximum again; thus the period from\r\nmaximum to maximum is about 11 years.\r\n\r\nThrough watching these black spots disappear around one edge of the sun\r\nand then reappear after an interval of time on the other side, Galileo\r\ndiscovered that the sun turned completely around on its axis in 25 days.\r\n\r\n[Figure 136: SUN-SPOTS, DIRECT PHOTOGRAPH.\r\nCompare with photograph on page 214, also made on same day by\r\nthe Mount Wilson Observatory.]\r\n\r\nFurther study disclosed the still stranger fact that the sun does not\r\nturn around in a solid body. Areas near the equator were found to\r\ncomplete a revolution in 25 days, but they were seen to forge ahead of\r\nthose regions in higher latitudes; 45 degrees north and south latitude,\r\nthe rotation period is 27½ days; 60 degrees north and south latitude,\r\nthe period is 31.2 days, and in 80 degrees north and south latitude, the\r\nperiod is 35.3 days. This alone can be regarded as proof that the sun's\r\napparent surface is not solid but is either in a liquid or gaseous\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nA _total_ eclipse of the sun is caused by the moon passing between the\r\nearth and the sun, and since the moon is apparently the same size as the\r\nsun in the heavens, it hides the bright face of this luminary from our\r\nview; but the long shadow which trails behind the moon must touch the\r\nearth. The shadow moves along a narrow strip as the earth revolves and\r\nonly those who are in this shadow can see the sun totally eclipsed.\r\n\r\nIf the shadow of the moon does not quite touch the earth, the moon's\r\ndisk does not quite cover the sun.\r\n[Figure 137]\r\nThen the dark body of the moon is seen surrounded by a ring of light.\r\nThis is called an _annular_ eclipse.\r\n\r\nIn a _partial_ eclipse, the sun's disk suddenly becomes indented on one\r\nside, the indentation slowly increasing for some time, and then\r\ndiminishing until it disappears altogether.\r\n\r\nTotal solar eclipses are extremely infrequent in any one place because\r\nof the smallness of the cone of the moon's shadow. This shadow draws a\r\nblack streak across the earth, which, under favorable circumstances, may\r\nhave a breadth of a little more than 160 miles and a length of 10,000 to\r\n12,000 miles. The width of the shadow depends upon the nearness of the\r\nmoon for if its shadow just touches the earth, the streak will have no\r\nsensible width. A partial solar eclipse is visible 2,100 miles or more\r\non either side of the region where the eclipse is total.\r\n\r\n[Figure 138: RELATIVE POSITION OF THE SUN, MOON AND EARTH\r\nAT THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF SEPTEMBER 10, 1923.\r\n(The two words at the point of the shadow's contact with the Earth\r\nare \"Catalina\" and \"San Diego.\") Drawing by Dr. Mars F. Baumgardt,\r\nCurator of Clark Observatory, Los Angeles, Calif.]\r\n\r\nSince the shadow of the moon passes across the earth at the furious rate\r\nof 1300 miles an hour, a total eclipse of the sun lasts for only a few\r\nminutes,--and for this length of time, short as it is, some thanks is\r\ndue to the fact that the earth, in revolving upon its axis, carries the\r\nobserver and the ground upon which he stands along the same direction in\r\nwhich the shadow is moving. Total eclipses are of extremely rare\r\noccurrence and only happen about once in every three hundred years for\r\nany selected spot on the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nAn interesting description of a total eclipse may be found in\r\nFlammarion's \"Astronomy for Amateurs\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The luminous disk of the sun is gradually corroded. Another disk, as\r\nblack as ink, creeps in front of it and little by little invades it\r\nentirely. The atmosphere takes on a wan, sepulchral hue; astonished\r\nnature is hushed in profound silence; an immense veil of sadness spreads\r\nover the world. Night comes on suddenly, and the stars shine out in the\r\nHeavens. It seems as though by some mysterious cataclysm the Sun had\r\ndisappeared forever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Moulton in his \"Astronomy\" gives another splendid\r\ndescription:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It always occurs precisely at new moon, and consequently the moon is\r\ninvisible until it begins to obscure the sun. Steadily the moon moves\r\nover the sun's disk; and, as the instant of totality draws near, the\r\nlight rapidly fails, animals become restless and everything takes on a\r\nweird appearance. Suddenly a shadow rushes across the surface of the\r\nearth at the rate of more than 1300 miles an hour, the sun is covered,\r\nthe stars flash out, around the apparent edge of the moon are rose-colored\r\nprominences of vaporous material forced up from the sun's\r\nsurface to a height of perhaps 200,000 miles, and all around the sun\r\nextending out as far as half its diameter are streamers of pearly light\r\nwhich constitutes the sun's corona. After seven minutes at the very\r\nmost, the western edge of the sun is uncovered and daylight suddenly\r\nappears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn \"New Astronomy,\" Langley tells of the sensations of an observer\r\nas the moon's shadow passes furiously on its way:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The bright cloud I saw distinctly put out like a candle. The rapidity\r\nof the shadow, and the intensity produced a feeling that something\r\nmaterial was sweeping over the earth at a speed perfectly frightful. I\r\ninvoluntarily listened for the rushing noise of a mighty wind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 8th, 1918, September 10, 1923, and on January 24th, 1925, many\r\npeople in the United States were privileged to view the wonderful\r\nspectacle of a total eclipse. Scientists came from all over the world to\r\nwitness the solar eclipse of 1923, for not only was it visible from an\r\nattractive corner of our country at a pleasant time of the year, but the\r\nsun was at a convenient altitude for observation. Many photographs were\r\ntaken of the great flaming corona, some even from airplanes.\r\n\r\nAlthough people now travel halfway across the earth in order to be able\r\nto witness an eclipse, in olden days such an occasion was marked by the\r\ngreatest terror.\r\n\r\n[Figure 139: THE SOLAR CORONA.\r\nPhotographed during the eclipse of June 8, 1918, at Green River,\r\nWyoming, by the Mount Wilson Observatory Expedition.]\r\n\r\nTo the ancients they were without the order of nature, and in Rome, at\r\none time, it was blasphemy, and punishable by law, to talk publicly of\r\ntheir being due to natural causes.\r\n\r\nThe Chaldeans believed the sun and moon to be black on the hidden side,\r\nand upon the displeasure of the Gods, the darkened side was turned to\r\nthe earth thus causing an eclipse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 140: SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN, RECORDED\r\nWITH THE AID OF A KODAK.\r\nPhotographed by Edith Carlson at Palo Alto, California, September\r\n10, 1923.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people among the European nations covered their wells and fountains\r\nfor fear that the water would become contaminated by the poisonous,\r\nmists which arose during an eclipse. The notion was probably due to the\r\nfact that the drop in temperature is often accompanied by a fall of dew.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvians thrashed dogs during an eclipse so that their howling\r\nwould keep evil spirits away, and for the same reason, the Romans beat\r\ntheir pots and pans, lifted up torches and fire-brands into the air. The\r\npeople of the Northern nations also created a great din, for they\r\nimagined that the sun was pursued by fierce wolves (Skoll and Hati), who\r\ntried to swallow their brilliant prey so that the world would return to\r\nits primeval darkness.\r\n\r\nCrooke, in \"Popular Religion and Folk-Lore,\" says that\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A high-caste Hindu will eat no food that has remained in the house\r\nduring an eclipse, and all earthen vessels which are in the house at the\r\ntime, must be broken. During an eclipse all household business is\r\nsuspended, and eating and drinking is prohibited, even sleep at such\r\ntimes is forbidden, for it is then that the demons and devils are most\r\nactive. The most effectual way of scaring the demon Rahu and releasing\r\nthe afflicted planets is to bathe in some sacred stream and for\r\nprotection, a Brahman should stand in the water beside the worshipper\r\nand recite the Gayatri.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that at such times the rivers are covered with human\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nSome barbarian tribes imagined that when the sun or moon began to lose\r\nits light, the orb was sickening under the arts of a wicked magician and\r\nthey danced and screamed and beat their tomtoms in a wild frenzy so that\r\nthe wicked one might become afraid and steal away. The well-known idea\r\nof the Chinese, however, is the most interesting of all, for there are\r\nrecords showing that for several thousand years these people believed\r\nthat an eclipse was caused by the attempt on the part of a huge black\r\ndragon to seize the burning ball and swallow it. The dread of such\r\na catastrophe so preyed upon the minds of the populace that it is\r\nreported in the \"Tshu-King,\" one of the oldest chronicles in existence,\r\nthat the ancient astronomers Ho and Hi had their heads laid before their\r\nfeet for failing to predict an eclipse of the sun. Plenty of time to get\r\nout drums and kettles and to make the deafening noise which had always\r\ncaused the monster to drop the sun was always given after this little\r\nincident. Douglas, in \"History of China,\" relates that at this time, the\r\nintervention of every official in the country is called upon to save the\r\nsun from being destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Some months before the expected eclipse the board of astronomers\r\nnotifies the exact date of its appearance to the officials of the board\r\nof rites, who in their turn announce its appearance to the viceroys and\r\ngovernors of the provinces. They transmit the message to all their\r\nsubordinates, so that, when the time arrives, an army of mandarins stand\r\nprepared to avert disaster. Their procedure is simple and as neither the\r\nsun nor the moon have ever been devoured, it is regarded as efficacious.\r\nAt the appointed time the mandarins assemble at the yamen of the senior\r\nofficial, and arrange themselves before an altar set up in the\r\ncourtyard, on which incense is burning. At a given signal, they fall\r\ndown on their knees and perform Ko-t-ow, after which the attendants beat\r\ndrums and gongs to frighten away the oppressive monster, while the\r\npriests move in a procession round the altar chanting prayers and\r\nformulas. To assist the mandarins in their patriotic efforts, the people\r\nmount to the roofs of their houses, and add to the din which issues from\r\nthe yamen by beating everything capable of emitting resounding noises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grecians, however, ascribing all things to the gods, thought that\r\nthe phenomenon was due to Jupiter, who, sometimes wishing to keep his\r\nbusiness on earth secret from the other immortals on Mount Olympus, kept\r\nthem from seeing him by hanging a little covering over the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The Olympian Father hangs a noon-day night\r\n    O'er the sun's disk and veils its glittering light,\r\n    Fear falls on man. Hence miracles, before\r\n    Incredible, are counted miracles no more.\"\r\n\r\n         --_Archilochus._ (_Trans. by_ SIR CHAS. ABRAHAM ELTON.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have just obtained a close view of one of the stars of the\r\nGalaxy,--the nearest star, our own sun,--and have gazed in admiration at\r\nthe pearly setting of its corona, the turbulent waves of its crimson\r\natmosphere, its black spots and moving belts, and our admiration\r\nincreases as we visualize in our mind's eye, the eight fine planets\r\nwhich swing unceasingly around in its beautiful light.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the sun, these planets are very small; either the\r\nearth, Mars, Venus or Mercury could be dropped into an average-sized\r\nsun-spot, or all four into an extra large sun-spot, while a thousand\r\nglobes huge as Jupiter would scarcely balance the globe of the sun.\r\nIndeed, it has been computed that if the total mass of the whole solar\r\nsystem, with the exception of the sun, were called I, then the mass of\r\nthe sun on the same scale would be 744.\r\n\r\nAll of the planets of the solar system roll as if on a great shield, one\r\norbit set within the other at widely separated intervals. These orbits\r\nare not round but elliptical, with the sun shining at one focus of each\r\nelliptical orbit.\r\n\r\nAn unseen force called gravitation holds the planets in their pathways,\r\nalways just so near and just so far from the sun. This is the same force\r\nthat holds the stars in a Galaxy and keeps the objects on the earth from\r\nsliding off into space. Since the attractive power of the sun is\r\ntremendous, the planets must travel around their pathways at a\r\ntremendous rate in order to develop enough centrifugal force to\r\noffset the gravitational pull, and the closer the planet the faster it\r\nmust fly.\r\n\r\n[Figure 141: The orbits of the four outer planets, Neptune, Uranus,\r\nSaturn and Jupiter, and the orbits of Mars and the Earth, drawn to\r\nscale. (Within the orbit of the Earth would appear the orbits of Venus\r\nand Mercury, too small to be shown in this drawing.)]\r\n\r\nMercury, for instance, travels at a rate of 35 miles a second while\r\nNeptune, seventy-five times as far off, has an orbital velocity of only\r\n3.4 miles a second. The following table shows the distances of each\r\nplanet from the sun and the time it takes it to complete its journey\r\naround its orbit, beginning with Mercury, the nearest planet to the sun,\r\nand continuing outward.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Distances_                                 _Period of_\r\n   _from the Sun_                              _Revolution_\r\n\r\n    Mercury           35,750,000   miles          88 days\r\n\r\n    Venus             66,750,000     \"           225 \"\r\n\r\n    Earth             92,500,000     \"           365 \"\r\n\r\n    Mars             141,000,000     \"           687 \"\r\n\r\n    Jupiter          457,000,000     \"            12 years\r\n\r\n    Saturn           881,000,000     \"           29½ \"\r\n\r\n    Uranus           1,771,000,000   \"            84 \"\r\n\r\n    Neptune          2,775,000,000   \"           165 \"\r\n\r\n\r\nMercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are sometimes called the inner planets\r\nbecause they form a group nearest the sun but more frequently are\r\ncalled the Terrestrial Planets because they all have solid crusts like\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, forming a group called the outer or\r\nmajor planets, are more or less in a gaseous condition and are very huge\r\nin comparison to the first four.\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Neptune, the farthermost planet, encloses the orbits of all\r\nthe other planets, and is so very large that it requires 165 years for\r\nNeptune to travel around it. This is quite a contrast to the time\r\nconsumed by little Mercury who flies so close to the sun that he travels\r\naround it in 88 days. This, of course, means the length of the year on\r\neach of these planets.\r\n\r\nSince the planets shine by light reflected from the sun, half of their\r\nglobes are always bright,--and the other half is always hidden in the\r\ndarkness of the shadow which trails behind. Each planet, however,\r\nrotates on its axis, which gives each side in turn a night and day.\r\nException to this must be made in the case of Mercury and Venus, their\r\nrotation with respect to the sun having been destroyed by the powerful\r\ntidal actions of the sun eons ago. Hence only one hemisphere in each of\r\nthese planets is warmed by the light of the sun; the other forever faces\r\nthe darkness and the cold of outer space.\r\n\r\nThe period of a planet's rotation is determined by watching its\r\nmarkings, just as the period of the sun's rotation was determined by\r\nwatching its spots. The larger planets rotate much more swiftly than the\r\nsmaller ones; a \"day\" on Jupiter or Saturn is not half as long as on\r\nMars or on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe seasons of a planet depend on the angle at which its axis is tipped.\r\nThe axis of the earth tips over at an angle of 23½ degrees from the\r\nperpendicular to the plane of its orbit, so its seasons are fairly well\r\ndivided. Jupiter leans only 3 degrees and has little seasonal change but\r\npoor Uranus is inclined about 98 degrees and is subjected to the direst\r\nextremes. Since the year of Uranus consists of 84 of our years,\r\neach hemisphere has 42 years of darkness and 42 years of light.\r\n\r\nThe four inner planets are quite solid in comparison to the four outer\r\nones, which are largely gaseous.\r\n\r\n[Figure 142: The Axis of the Earth tips from the Perpendicular to\r\nthe Plane of its Orbit.]\r\n\r\nMercury is the most solid planet of all, being more like metal than the\r\nearth; neither Jupiter nor Saturn have stable surface crusts while\r\nSaturn is so light that it would float on water.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the diameters of the planets starting from Mercury,\r\nnearest to the sun, to Neptune, the farthest away.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mercury               3,030 miles\r\n    Venus                 7,700   \"\r\n    Earth                 7,927   \"\r\n    Mars                  4,230   \"\r\n    Jupiter              88,300   \"\r\n    Saturn               73,700   \"\r\n    Uranus               32,000   \"\r\n    Neptune              35,000   \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planets that are relatively near the sun have few or no satellites,\r\nMercury and Venus having none, Earth one, Mars two; those farther\r\ndistant have a goodly number, Uranus possessing four, Jupiter nine and\r\nSaturn ten.\r\n\r\n\r\nMars has been studied in much detail and, of all the planets, has\r\nexcited the most popular interest. Conditions are such that markings,\r\nmysterious at this distance, and colorful details, may be studied with\r\ncomparative ease. The other planets that have been studied are too far\r\naway, too close to the sun, or are obscured by too cloudy atmospheres to\r\npermit detailed observations. The great planet Jupiter forms a\r\nmagnificent picture, his broad face striped by colored bands which\r\noccasionally vary. This planet may be seen to turn completely around in\r\n9 hours and 50 minutes, while four of its moons revolve about it in\r\nclose attendance. Saturn is even more superbly magnificent than Jupiter,\r\nfor the great, flat, shining ring which encircles this planet is the\r\nwonder of the whole solar system.\r\n\r\nBecause the planets are so much closer than the stars, they may be seen\r\nto change their places against the background of the constellations. An\r\nalmanac will tell which of these worlds are visible in the evening\r\nduring the different months and where they may be found. Since they lie\r\nnearly in the same plane as the orbit of the earth, they are always\r\nfound within the boundaries of a pathway 16 degrees wide. This pathway\r\ncircles the sky and is marked by the sun in the daytime and the moon at\r\nnight. All the planets except Mars, Venus and Mercury travel nearly in\r\nthe middle of this path which in ancient times was named the zodiac.\r\n\r\nThe constellations which lie along the pathway of the sun, moon and\r\nplanets are called the constellations of the zodiac. The following are\r\nthe Latin names of the signs of the twelve parts of the zodiac, with\r\ntheir English equivalents:\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Spring_: Aries, the Ram ♈︎      _Summer_: Cancer, the Crab ♋︎\r\n    Taurus, the Bull ♉︎               Leo, the Lion ♌︎\r\n    Gemini, the Twins ♊︎              Virgo, the Virgin ♍︎\r\n\r\n   _Autumn_: Libra, the Scales ♎︎   _Winter_: Capricornus, the Goat ♑︎\r\n    Scorpio, the Scorpion ♏︎          Aquarius, the Water-carrier ♒︎\r\n    Sagittarius, the Archer ♐︎        Pisces, the Fishes ♓︎\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the winter months begin, the sun is in the constellation of\r\nSagittarius, in the beginning of spring in the constellation of Pisces,\r\nin the beginning of summer, in Gemini, and at the commencement of\r\nautumn, in the constellation of Virgo. The zodiacal constellations are\r\nvery important, and to the people in the olden days, the sun's position\r\nin front of them was a way to tell the season of the year. The words of\r\nChaucer\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \"and the young sonne\r\n    Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne\"\r\n\r\n\r\nmeant to any ploughboy in old England that it was April because during\r\nthe first half of April the sun traverses the last half of Aries, the\r\nconstellation of the Ram. Chaucer, by the way, wrote a book to teach\r\n\"litel Lewis\" his son, \"to knowe every time of the day by the light of\r\nthe sonne, and every time of the night by the starres fixed.\"\r\n\r\nTo locate a planet in modern days one has only to look up its position\r\nin the almanac or on a monthly sky map and then find it similarly\r\nlocated in the same constellation in the sky. The Monthly Evening Sky\r\nMap, an eight page journal for the amateur published by Leon Barritt,\r\n150 Nassau St., New York, contains not only a map of the sky for every\r\nmonth, but also current astronomical news. With such aid, after becoming\r\nfamiliar with the belt of zodiacal constellations--which are easily\r\nlearned by the following verse, it is not difficult to find the nearest\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The Ram, the Bull, the Heavenly Twins\r\n    And next the Crab, the Lion shines\r\n    The Virgin and the Scales.\r\n    The Scorpion, the Archer and He-goat,\r\n    The Man that holds the Watering-pot,\r\n    The Fish with glittering tails.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Venus and Jupiter are brighter than first magnitude stars and will\r\nbe recognized with but little difficulty. Mars and Saturn are as\r\nbright as first magnitude stars, although Saturn is not so easy to find\r\nunless its location is definitely known. Venus is a very white star,\r\nJupiter a bright yellow, Saturn a pale orange, and Mars a fiery red.\r\nMars wanders farther south than any other planet seen in the evening\r\nskies. Mercury may sometimes be seen after sunset in the spring or\r\nbefore sunrise in the fall, but only for a few days at a time and hence\r\nwill seldom be seen by one who does not know just when, as well as\r\nwhere, to look for it. Uranus and Neptune are too far away and the\r\nplanetoids too small to be of much interest to amateurs.\r\n\r\nIf examined with a glass the planets will show a bright round disk while\r\na star is no more than a point of light. Mercury and Venus show phases\r\njust as our moon for their orbits lie between the earth and the sun.\r\nVenus is particularly beautiful as a crescent and is best seen in the\r\nwest near the setting sun. Jupiter ranks second in popularity for even a\r\nfield-glass discloses his round shining face and four of his principal\r\nmoons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETOIDS\r\n\r\nTHE MINIATURE WORLDS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Mars and Jupiter lies an immense lane of over 300,000,000 miles.\r\nThis lane had been considered vacant until a century and a quarter ago,\r\nand since it was an exception to the general law of planetary distances,\r\nit had long been of interest to astronomers. Mercury, Venus, Earth and\r\nMars are distant 35,750,000; 66,750,000; 92,500,000 and 141,000,000\r\nmiles, respectively, from the sun; then came this wide vacancy, with the\r\norder for the distances between the planets again resumed beyond\r\nJupiter. When the great Kepler suggested that there must be an invisible\r\nplanet revolving in this gap, many thought that the idea was only a\r\ndream of a great mind, for a planet so close would have been discovered\r\nlong ago. Yet the suggestion was often considered, for the space\r\nhad been to astronomers as a false note is to a musician, and they knew\r\nthat if there were only a planet circling here, the spaces between every\r\nworld would \"increase with regularity in proceeding outward from the\r\nsun\" and the solar kingdom would then be laid out in perfect harmony.\r\nThe matter was left at this stage for many years, indeed it was not\r\nuntil 200 years after the suggestion was made that astronomers banded\r\ntogether, divided up the zodiac into twenty-four parts and,\r\ndistributing them among an equal number of observers, began a systematic\r\nsearch. It is quite likely that during the 200 years previous to 1801,\r\nwhen the search began, not an astronomer lived but who had at some time\r\nwished to participate in such a search. Astronomers were, however, so\r\nfew, the heavens so wide and life so short, that there was more than a\r\nload already on each of those earnest workers among the star fields.\r\n\r\nWhy is it, by the way, that more people are not curious about the sky?\r\nIt sometimes happens that those who have stars for a hobby, a\r\nrocking-horse Pegasus, unexpectedly find themselves transported by the\r\nWinged Horse to regions above. Thus, Piazzi, at Palermo on the island of\r\nSicily, happened across the first of the little planets, or\r\n\"planetoids,\" quite by accident, delighting not only himself but every\r\nscientist in the world, for order was now established in the solar\r\nsystem. Although this newly discovered planet was so tiny that its whole\r\nsurface was no more than equal to the area of the United States, the\r\nvery fact of its existence in what had seemed a wasted space, probably\r\ngave as much satisfaction as the discovery of Uranus ten years before.\r\nAt the request of Piazzi, the new planet was named Ceres after the\r\ntutelary Goddess of Sicily, and +C as a symbol was appropriately given\r\nthe sign of the sickle: +C.\r\n\r\nBut a year later, Dr. Olbers, a physician at Bremen in Lower Saxony,\r\ndiscovered a second planetoid in the same region, with a mean\r\ndistance and a periodic time so nearly identical with that of Ceres that\r\nthey were almost within hailing distance. This second planetoid, which\r\nwas named Pallas, was not greeted as joyously as the first, for now a\r\nsituation was created that was harder to explain than the great vacant\r\ngap. But this was not all. In 1804, still another little globe was\r\ndiscovered, which was called Juno, and another in 1807, which was named\r\nVesta,--four little planets in less than six years! Subsequent\r\ndiscoveries have brought the number almost up to 1000. An explanation by\r\nOlbers suggested that these minute bodies might be fragments of an\r\nexploded planet, but since they do not lie in the same plane nor do\r\ntheir orbits have a common point of intersection, this theory was\r\ndiscarded. It was then thought that the great attractive force of\r\nJupiter would not allow a planet to form in the space. This theory was\r\nalso discarded, and even now, a century and a quarter later, no one\r\ntheory bearing on the origin of the little worlds has found general\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nFollowing the custom of the ancients, the planetoids were given the\r\nnames of Greek divinities, the next four being named Astræa, Hebe, Iris\r\nand Flora. But the names of Greek divinities at last ran out, and the\r\nplanetoids were christened with more common names. Astronomers do not\r\nbother with any of these names, however, except in the case of a few.\r\nThe rest they refer to by inclosing its number in a circle.\r\n\r\nAlthough these little globes are very small, many of them have been\r\nfound to possess distinct individuality. Vesta, for instance, is\r\nexceedingly bright, while Ceres, in contrast, is gray and dull. An\r\nexplanation is that Ceres may be composed \"of rugged and sombre rock,\r\nunclothed by any vestige of air, while Vesta displays a brilliant shell\r\nof clouds.\" Ceres is the largest of the planetoids, although even Ceres\r\nis less than 500 miles in diameter. Eros, which comes closer to the\r\nearth than any other known celestial body with the exception of\r\nthe moon, exhibits a rapid variation in the brilliancy of its light. It\r\nis thought that this may be due to a rough, uneven surface with unequal\r\nreflecting power, for Eros is no more than a huge rock only 20 miles\r\nacross. It has also been suggested that perhaps Eros consists of two\r\nbodies revolving close together so that one body eclipses the other in\r\ncertain parts of its orbit, or again, it may be an angular body, not\r\nround at all! Many of the planetoids are smaller than Eros, some being\r\nonly a few miles across.\r\n\r\nThus a thousand mysterious little worlds of assorted shapes and sizes\r\nroll along on their individual pathways in the great space between the\r\norbit of Mars and the orbit of the earth. The bright light of Vesta, the\r\ndull glow of Ceres and the variable brilliancy of Eros lightly suggest\r\nthe interest with which further observations and study may invest each\r\ntiny planet, as larger and more powerful telescopes are constructed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMETS AND METEORS\r\n\r\n_Comets_\r\n\r\n    \"Jove brandishing a star which men a comet call.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA comet, in olden times, was an object of terror and dread and was\r\nregarded as an omen of pestilence and war. Searching through ancient\r\nrecords, incidents without number could be narrated to show that the\r\nmalicious influence of some comet had caused--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Fever, sickness, plague, and death,\r\n    Hard times, need and hunger's scathe,\r\n    Great heat, drought, and barren Nature,\r\n    War, murder, riots, fire and slaughter,\r\n    Frost, cold, storms, and want of water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJosephus tells us that the destruction of Jerusalem in 69 A.D. was\r\ncaused by no less than the sword shaped comet which pierced the heavens\r\nabove the city!\r\n\r\nA story is sometimes told of the great consternation caused in Europe in\r\n1456 at the appearance of Halley's comet. This great shaft of light\r\nmoving across the sky so disturbed the equanimity of Pope Calixtus that\r\nhe instituted a form of prayer (\"Lord, deliver us from the devil, the\r\nTurk and the comet\") as a protection against its baleful influence. But\r\nthe comet remained, and, with his people mightily afraid, the pope\r\nhimself was forced \"to interfere, exorcise and expell\" the malignant one\r\nfrom the skies.\r\n\r\nHalley's comet has always been a most interesting comet. The last time\r\nthat it appeared, in 1910, the earth rolled right through its beautiful,\r\nhighly diffused tail, and although the experience was of interest to\r\nastronomers, it affected not a whit the affairs of the populace; indeed,\r\nbut few people knew about it.\r\n\r\nIn 1680, Halley, an English astronomer and mathematician, while on a\r\npassage to France, was the first to observe this great comet, and later\r\nmade observations with Cassini at Paris, where he observed its\r\nappearance with great care and painstakingly computed the elements of\r\nits orbit. From the nature of its orbit, he predicted that it would\r\nreturn at regular intervals of 75 years. He even traced this comet back\r\non his historical table of comets, and found that the comets of 1607,\r\n1531 and 1456 had the same orbit as the one which had appeared in 1680.\r\nSeventy-five years after, true to his prediction, the comet returned,\r\nthus proving that comets may travel in elongated orbits and appear\r\nperiodically. Halley has the honor of being the first to predict the\r\nreturn of a comet.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that some comets require hundreds and even thousands of\r\nyears to perform a revolution around the sun; Donati's comet, one of the\r\nmost famous comets, which appeared in 1858 \"like a plume of fire,\r\nshaped like a bird of paradise,\" travels on such a long circuit that it\r\nreturns only every 2000 years. The brilliant comet of 1811, which\r\nremained visible for nearly ten months, has a period estimated as being\r\naround 3000 years. But the orbits of some comets are even longer than\r\nthis, some traveling so far into space that they not only over-leap the\r\nboundary of Neptune but fly to a turning-post so distant that we may\r\nnever see them return. More than 30 short period comets have been\r\ndiscovered and these have their orbits entirely within the solar system.\r\nEncke's comet, with a period of 3½ years, has the shortest period\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[Figure 143]\r\nAlthough it was discovered to the relief of mankind that comets have no\r\ninfluence upon the earth, it was also discovered that some of the\r\nplanets with great mass and strong gravitational power, can exert\r\nconsiderable influence on a comet, in fact, enough influence to attract\r\nmany of these celestial bodies out of their courses and force them to\r\nmake their outer turn around a point near that planet's orbit. Jupiter\r\nhas a larger family of comets than any other planet. If a planet once\r\ncaptures a comet it is his captive forever, unless the near approach of\r\nsome planet of greater mass pulls the comet away and forces it to\r\nenclose its new master in the outer end of its orbit.\r\n\r\n[Figure 144]\r\nA large comet first appears among the stars as a dim spot of light. It\r\nmay appear from any direction, for, although comets are considered\r\nmembers of the solar system, their orbits do not lie in the same plane\r\nas the planets. As it sweeps toward the sun with terrible velocity,\r\nwhich increases hourly, a long streamer of luminous gas gradually\r\ndevelops and floats backward from its head. A small comet often\r\nhas no tail, but a large comet usually possesses a long and beautiful\r\none, and has been known to possess two, and even half a dozen. This\r\ntail, or tails, are at their best when close to the sun, although at all\r\ntimes swung carefully away from the terrific flames of that luminary.\r\nScientists almost hold their breath sometimes at the close call of\r\ncomets, for the Great Comet of 1843 almost grazed the surface of the sun\r\nand many another has passed right through the outstretched banners of\r\nthe corona. After darting swiftly around this brilliant center, the\r\ncomet again heads into fathomless space, its long, bright tail gradually\r\ndisappearing and its fierce speed relaxing as it escapes farther and\r\nfarther from the sun's control.\r\n\r\nThe word comet means a \"long-haired\" star. The star-like nucleus of the\r\ncomet is called the head and the long nebulous streamer which trails\r\nbehind, the tail. The head may be colossal, or it may be a mere shred;\r\nthe head of Donati's comet would have more than filled the space between\r\nthe earth and moon, while that of the comet of 1811 was considerably\r\nlarger than the sun itself. The length of a comet's tail is equally\r\namazing for it extends often for millions of miles. The comet of 1882\r\nhad 100,000,000 miles of tail while that of 1483 had one twice as long.\r\nThe comet of 1680 extended below the horizon when its head touched the\r\nzenith.\r\n\r\nThe mean density of a comet is very small. Young states that it is\r\nnothing more than a sandbank--a swarm of solid particles of unknown size\r\nand widely separated. This light and airy object darts through space at\r\na most hectic speed, often at the rate of a number of hundred miles per\r\nsecond, when close to the sun. It is of such flimsy construction that\r\nits light does not even obscure the stars although there have been\r\ncomets so bright that they were visible in the daytime.\r\n\r\nIt is now believed that a comet derives its light, except that\r\nportion which is reflected sunlight, from electrical discharges between\r\nits particles. By some influence emanating from the sun, gas is emitted\r\nfrom the scattered swarm of meteoric particles which compose the head,\r\nand these stream out \"like smoke from a locomotive\" in a magnificent\r\nluminous trail. This only occurs when in the vicinity of the sun. Each\r\ntime the comet comes back to the sun, it loses some of its beauty and\r\nits mass decreases--yet like a moth to a flame, it always returns.\r\nNewcomb describes the way in which a comet gradually loses itself in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Altogether a good idea of the operations going on in a comet may be\r\nobtained if we conceive of a nucleus (or head) to be composed of water\r\nor other volatile fluid which is boiling away under the heat of the sun,\r\nwhile the tail is a column of steam rising from it. We do not see the\r\nsame tail of the comet all the time because the matter which makes up\r\nthe tail is constantly streaming outwards and constantly being replaced\r\nby new vapor rising from the nucleus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of time, the whole comet becomes disintegrated and its\r\npathway scattered with debris. Astronomers now look upon meteors as the\r\nremains of worn out comets, for meteoric swarms follow along the same\r\norbits as many of the comets. When the earth crosses the orbit of a\r\ndisintegrated comet, or meteoric swarm, the fragments come in contact\r\nwith our atmosphere where they blaze into incandescence and are seen as\r\nshooting stars.\r\n\r\nThe Biela comet is often mentioned as furnishing the best example of\r\ncomet disintegration. This comet, which was discovered in 1826, had a\r\nperiod of 6.6 years. In 1846, after a lapse of twenty years, it was\r\nnoticed to be considerably more elongated than usual and a month later\r\nit had separated into two comets, each developing a tail of its own.\r\nBefore long these twin comets had become separated by 200,000 miles. On\r\nits next return, in 1852, the two halves of Biela appeared for the\r\nsecond time, with the distance between them increased to 1,500,000\r\nmiles. Once again they flew around the sun, but it was a farewell\r\ntour, for one streak of light followed the other out into space, grew\r\nfainter and fainter and finally disappeared, never to be seen again.\r\n\r\n[Figure 145: COMET 1910a. Photograph with 6-inch Bruce Lens by Yerkes\r\nObservatory.]\r\n\r\nBut just here is the best part of the story, for although\r\nthe comets have completely vanished, in their place every year comes a\r\nradiant display of meteors! These meteors--the Andromids, coming on the\r\n27th of November regularly--are believed to be the \"fragments of the\r\nlost comet of Biela\"! Thus, Serviss, with a touch of art, gives the\r\nshivery atmosphere of Poe to such an uncanny proceeding.\r\n\r\nAlthough comets have here been placed with planets and planetoids under\r\nthe heading of \"The Children of the Sun,\" we are not sure, as yet, of\r\nthe origin of comets. There is one theory which suggests that comets may\r\nbe the waste material of the solar system; the left-overs, as it were,\r\nafter the planetary system was formed. Again, perhaps, a great comet may\r\nbe material drawn in from outside space, perhaps flying back and\r\nforth between two stars until it becomes so exhausted that one of the\r\nstars is able to capture it. At least we know that the solar system now\r\npossesses a great number of comets who bow to the mastery of our star\r\nand never wander beyond the orbits of his planets. If these are not true\r\nchildren of the sun they are at least his adopted ones, and there is\r\nnothing that will ever lure them from his magnetic personality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meteors_\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteoric showers are popularly called \"shooting stars.\" At least one\r\nshooting star may be seen every ten minutes but at certain times of the\r\nyear they appear in showers. Three of the most profuse of these \"star\"\r\nshowers appear from the\r\n\r\n\r\n    9th to 11th of August--Perseus (radiant point)\r\n    13th to 15th of November--Leo\r\n    27th to 29th of November--Andromeda\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Perseids, radiating from a point in the constellation of Perseus,\r\nare best seen about three o'clock in the morning. These meteors are\r\ncalled the \"Tears of Saint Lawrence\" and are noted in ancient legends as\r\nthe \"fiery tears\" of this saint who was cruelly persecuted and burned at\r\nthe stake. His festival is celebrated on the 10th of August, but his\r\n\"tears\" fall for three whole nights.\r\n\r\nThe Leonid star shower radiates from the vicinity of the star Y in the\r\nSickle of Leo and rains most thickly in the early morning hours. On an\r\naverage of every 33 years the earth's orbit seems to cut through a\r\ndenser portion of this meteoric swarm which causes especially beautiful\r\ndisplays. There is a record of this spectacular performance for a\r\nthousand years back, although it was not until after the brilliant\r\ndisplays of 1799, 1833 and 1866 that astronomers began a vigorous\r\ninvestigation of the subject of shooting stars. On the night of November\r\n13th, 1833, \"the stars fell like flakes of snow, varying in size from a\r\nmoving point or phosphorescent line to globes of the moon's\r\ndiameter.\" A witness of the spectacle wrote for the Christian Advocate\r\nand Journal of the following month, 1833, the following enthusiastic\r\ndescription:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had congregated to a point\r\nnear the zenith, and were simultaneously shooting forth, with the\r\nvelocity of lightning, to every part of the horizon; and yet they were\r\nnot exhausted; thousands swiftly followed in the track of thousands,\r\n_as if created for the occasion_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shower was particularly well observed in the eastern part of North\r\nAmerica. One eye-witness in the Southern States says that the negroes on\r\nthe plantations were so unnerved that they \"lay prostrate on the ground,\r\nsome speechless and some with the bitterest cries, but with their hands\r\nupraised, imploring God to save the world and them.\" Another witness of\r\nthe scene in the vicinity of Niagara Falls says that \"no spectacle so\r\nterribly grand and sublime was ever before beheld by man as that of the\r\n_firmament descending in fiery torrents over the dark and roaring\r\ncataract_.\" Comstock tells of one illiterate observer being anxious to\r\nsee how the heavens would appear the next evening, for he believed that\r\nthere would be no stars left. In 1866 this shower was also a wonderful\r\nspectacle commencing \"about 11:30 P. M., with the appearance at brief\r\nintervals of single meteors; then they came in twos and threes, steadily\r\nand rapidly increasing in number till 1 h. 13 min. A. M. on November\r\n14th, when no fewer than 57 appeared in one minute. From this time the\r\nintensity of the shower diminished gradually, wholly ceasing about 4 A.\r\nM. The total number of meteors which at that time came within the limits\r\nof the earth's atmosphere was estimated at about 240,000.\" This was not\r\nas brilliant a spectacle as when in 1833 the meteors fell like\r\nsnowflakes, but it must have been very fine for, to continue with the\r\ndescription of an observer who witnessed it from Great Britain:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 146: METEORIC SHOWER OF NOVEMBER 13, 1833.\r\n   \"The stars from Heaven like rain-drops from a bough.\r\n    Like tears they poured adown creation's face.\"\r\n    --_Bailey_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The great majority were white, with a bluish or yellowish tinge; a\r\nconsiderable number were red and orange; and a few were blue; many\r\nsurpassed the fixed stars in lustre and some were even brighter than\r\nVenus--Most of the meteors left trains of vivid green light 5 degrees to\r\n15 degrees in length, which marked their course through the heavens, and\r\nendured for 3 seconds on the average, then became dissipated; though\r\nsome of the trains were almost 40 degrees in length, and remained in\r\nsight for several minutes.\" The shower of 1899 was quite naturally\r\nanticipated with much eagerness but it fell far short of the brilliant\r\ndisplays seen in 1866 and 1833.\r\n\r\nThe third shower listed, the Andromids, radiate from the orange-gold\r\nstar on the foot of Andromeda during the last week in November. These\r\nare best seen during the evening. They are also called the Biela meteors\r\nand bring to mind the interesting history of the late Biela comet.\r\n\r\nMany hundreds of these radiant points have now been discovered. The\r\nmeteors which appear in a direct line to the eye, appear as points or\r\nstars; those appearing farthest from the center, other things being\r\nequal, appear to have the longest trails but their paths are all\r\nparallel. The illustration in perspective of the trains coming forward\r\nfrom a point on the horizon of a desert illustrates this clearly.\r\n\r\nMeteors, which represent the wreckage which comets strew along their\r\norbits, are not visible until they strike our atmosphere, which causes\r\nthem to glow. They \"glow\" because they become white-hot, and they become\r\nwhite-hot because they have been rushing through space at planetary\r\nspeed, and striking our atmosphere is like striking a match against a\r\nstone wall. The friction thus engendered causes the smaller particles to\r\nburst into flame and melt in a streak of fire, although the larger ones\r\nonly melt on the outside, which is thrown off in a streaming tail of\r\nincandescent matter, the remainder of the meteor falling to the earth\r\nlike a heavy rock. Thunders and visible explosions sometimes are\r\nheard as an accompaniment of the falling meteor. The meteors which fall\r\nto the ground are called \"meteorites,\" or \"ærolites,\" a literal\r\ntranslation of the latter term being \"airstone.\" On an average, however,\r\nthe individual bodies of a meteor swarm are very small, being\r\nrepresented by \"a cloud of silver dimes each about 250 miles from its\r\nnearest neighbor.\" The smaller and lighter meteors called shooting stars\r\nwhich are consumed in our atmosphere probably number from 10 to 20\r\nmillion daily.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a meteorite found is very large, a few weighing several\r\ntons, but this is most unusual. The one brought by Commander Peary from\r\nGreenland is 11 feet long and 5 feet wide and weighs 36 tons. This is\r\nnow on display in the Museum of Natural History in New York City. At\r\nEnsisheim, in Alsace, during the 15th century, a stone weighing 260\r\npounds which had descended from the sky was ordered by Emperor\r\nMaximilian to be suspended in the church where it hung for 300 years. A\r\nshower of nearly 3000 stones of various sizes occurred in Normandy\r\nwithin an elliptical area seven miles long and three miles wide. Nearly\r\nall the inhabitants of a large district saw the cloud and witnessed the\r\nrain of the stones.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and Romans thought that casting stones upon the earth was\r\nsome sort of pastime indulged in by the Gods and the Romans incorporated\r\nin a temple a shower of stones which fell on Alban Mount near Rome. A\r\nstone from Heaven was also reverenced in the masonry of the great Mosque\r\nof Mecca where it is annually kissed by thousands of pilgrims who begin\r\nholy rites by walking seven times around the Kaaba starting from the\r\ncorner where the black stone is fixed. The great stone in the pyramid of\r\nCholula, in Mexico, and a black stone at Emesa, in Syria, have also been\r\nregarded with religious veneration. In India, the residence of a soul in\r\nheaven is believed to be proportionate to its charities on earth,\r\nand when its allotted period is over, it falls to earth as a meteorite.\r\n\r\nIf picked up soon after it falls, a meteoric stone is found to be very\r\nhot on the outside while the inside is cold. One constant characteristic\r\nby which it may be identified is the fused, black, thin and glossy\r\ncrust, somewhat like varnish, which coats the surface of the meteoric\r\nstone. This surface crust is thin and sharply defined from the inner\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nThe predominating element in one class of meteorites is iron, generally\r\ncombined with a small amount of nickel. Copper, tin, cobalt and other\r\nsubstances are also found, but never silver or gold. Stony meteorites\r\nare, however, more common than iron meteorites.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of meteors, or shooting stars, varies from 12 to 40 miles a\r\nsecond. Herschel estimates their average height above the earth at the\r\ntime of their appearance as 73 miles, and 52 miles at the time of their\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nVENUS AND JUPITER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRIGHT PLANET OF VENUS, THE GODDESS OF LOVE\r\n\r\n_Diameter--7,700 miles_\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOST every one knows Venus, the beautiful Evening Star,\r\nwhich is also, by the way, an equally beautiful Morning Star. In\r\nancient times the Greeks believed these to be two different stars,\r\ncalling the Morning Star \"Phosphorus,\" the torchbearer who\r\nlights the way for the Dawn, and the Evening Star \"Hesperus,\"\r\nleader of the stars of night. These names were translated into\r\nLatin as Lucifer and Vesper. The Morning Star was the son of\r\nAstræus and Aurora and the Evening Star a brother of the Titan\r\nAtlas. Pythagoras is said to have been the first to identify Hesperus\r\nwith Phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n             \"Now glowed the firmament\r\n    With living sapphires: Hesperus, that led\r\n    The starry host, rode brightest.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dates that Venus may be seen are announced in the Almanac. Always\r\nlook in the west after sunset for this lovely star, or in the east\r\nbefore sunrise, never in either case more than 48 degrees away from the\r\nsun. It follows the sun so closely that it is never seen more than four\r\nhours after sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Sun was sunk, and after him the Star of Hesperus, whose Office is\r\nto bring the Twilight upon the Earth.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery 584 days Venus appears in the west as an evening star, first\r\nappearing about 20 minutes after sunset, near the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Figure 147: VENUS. Showing crescent phase. Photographed with the 40-inch\r\nrefractor at the Yerkes Observatory.]\r\n\r\nAfter being visible but a short time, it disappears from view not far\r\nfrom the point where the sun went down.\r\n\r\nEvery succeeding day this star appears at a higher elevation and glows\r\nbrighter and brighter; this continues for several months until it\r\nappears like a great lamp, outshining every other object in the heavens,\r\nexcept the moon. It then begins to appear at a lower elevation each\r\nevening and to set a little earlier, until in the course of two or three\r\nweeks it disappears in the early twilight. About two weeks after her\r\ndeparture from the evening sky, Venus appears in the east shining\r\nbrightly in the cool, gray hours just before Aurora opens the gates for\r\nthe Sun-god.\r\n\r\nDay by day, the Morning Star increases in brilliance just as did the\r\nEvening Star until it appears at the highest point above the horizon;\r\nthen its light gradually declines as each day its stay becomes shorter\r\nand shorter, until finally it pales in the morning light and is immersed\r\nin the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nVenus passes through its period of greatest brilliance every eighth\r\nyear. This last occurred in 1921 and will next occur in 1929. At such a\r\ntime the planet is so bright that it may be seen in daylight, if one\r\nknows where to look for it.\r\n\r\nThe discovery through a telescope that Venus had phases firmly\r\nestablished the theories of Copernicus.\r\n[Figure 148]\r\nWhen this Polish astronomer, in 1543, announced the astounding theory\r\nthat the sun was the center of our solar system, he said that if the\r\nplanets between the earth and the sun could be clearly seen, they\r\nwould show phases like the moon. When in 1610, Galileo turned his\r\ntelescope on Venus and beheld the beautiful little crescent, the\r\nfollowers of the ancient system of Ptolemy--who claimed that the _earth_\r\nwas the central body around which the sun and planets revolved--were,\r\nfor the first time, silenced, for they saw that the orbit of the earth\r\nmust enclose the orbit of Venus, and that they must both _revolve around\r\nthe sun_. Even a small telescope will show the phases of Venus, the\r\ncrescent being far more beautiful than one would imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Calm star! who was it named thee Lucifer,\r\n    From him who drew the third of Heaven down with him?\r\n    Oh! it was but the tradition of thy beauty!\r\n    For if the sun hath one part, and the moon one,\r\n    Thou hast the third part of the host of Heaven--\r\n    Which is its power--which is its beauty!\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Bailey._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen first seen through a telescope, in the evening twilight, Venus is\r\ngibbous, or nearly round. It has then just emerged on the farther side\r\nof the sun from us. After first becoming visible as a disk, it gradually\r\nassumes the figure of a half moon (this is at the point of its greatest\r\nelongation when it is at its highest in the sky); then as it again\r\napproaches the sun, it gradually becomes more and more like a slender\r\ncrescent of light. When Venus is showing nearly a full face, it is the\r\nwhole diameter of its orbit farther away than when it shows a slender\r\ncrescent. In this position it is 160 millions of miles distant from the\r\nearth; when nearest the earth it is only 22 millions of miles distant.\r\nThis is the reason why it appears much smaller when its full hemisphere\r\nis turned toward us than when it is seen as a small crescent. The\r\nproportion of this disk to the crescent is as 10 to 65. After becoming a\r\n\"silver bow,\" Venus disappears from the evening sky, later to appear on\r\nthe other side of the sun in the same guise, and gradually, as the\r\ndays go by, changing to a half moon and on again through all its phases.\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Venus is tipped slightly from the plane of the earth's\r\norbit; thus only on very rare occasions does it pass directly in front\r\nof the sun. Such a passage is called a transit. These transits occur in\r\npairs--two transits being 8 years apart and the successive pairs being\r\nseparated by 122 years. The last transit occurred on December 9th, 1874,\r\nand December 6th, 1882. They will not occur again until June 8th, 2004,\r\nand June 6th, 2012. There is only a slight possibility that some young\r\nreader may see this.\r\n\r\nWhen passing before the face of the sun, Venus appears as a round, black\r\nspot surrounded by an illuminated ring of atmosphere. The spectroscope\r\nhas shown that this atmosphere is about the same as the earth's,\r\npossibly a little more dense, and, strange to say, there is now strong\r\nevidence that water vapor and oxygen are conspicuous by their absence.\r\n\r\nThe dense atmosphere on Venus causes it to reflect light most\r\nbeautifully but it also obscures its surface so that it is very\r\ndifficult to see any markings. From time to time, when Venus passes\r\nbetween the sun and ourselves, it approaches to within 25 million miles\r\nof the earth, and even less--which is about 10 million miles closer than\r\nMars comes at its nearest approach--yet we can clearly see the surface\r\nof Mars for its atmosphere is very tenuous, while the surface of Venus\r\nis almost completely hidden under thick white clouds. At such a time,\r\nVenus is also a slender crescent while Mars shows a full round face. The\r\nspectroscope combined with observations made upon such surface markings\r\nas may be seen in full daylight has, however, enabled us to determine\r\nthat Venus rotates so slowly upon her axis that one face is always\r\nturned toward the sun. Thus the day on Venus must last forever and its\r\nnight-side has only one long night. It has been conjectured that this\r\ncondition may cause storms of frightful intensity upon its\r\nsurface, for high air currents on the light torrid side probably flow\r\nrapidly to the dark, cold side, with the cold air near the surface of\r\nthe dark, cold side flowing with equal rapidity to the torrid side. This\r\nstate of affairs may tend to equalize the intensity of the two extremes\r\nof climate. Being almost 30 million miles closer to the sun than the\r\nearth, Venus may have a higher temperature than the earth, although the\r\nheat may be somewhat modified by the clouds which are always in the sky.\r\n\r\nSometimes a faint, grayish light has been observed on the dark side of\r\nthe planet when it is nearest the earth. This was at one time thought to\r\nbe a reflection from a cold and frozen hemisphere, but a more likely\r\nsuggestion hints that it may be an electrical manifestation in the\r\nplanet's atmosphere, similar to our Aurora.\r\n\r\nVenus completes its orbit in 7½ months, its year being rather shorter\r\nthan ours.\r\n\r\nThe question of the existence of life not only on Venus, but on the\r\nother planets, is always a subject of general interest. Professor\r\nBarnard of the Yerkes Observatory had the following convictions on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There are possibilities of life on some of our brother worlds, though\r\nthat is not in any way a necessity, possibly on Mars and probably on\r\nVenus, with Mercury very doubtful but more probably lifeless. The moon\r\nwe will not consider, for we believe that it is dead long ago--even if\r\nit ever had any form of life upon it. It may even be that some world of\r\nour solar system has ceased to bear life and it has been suggested that\r\npossibly Mars is such a world. This is in no wise unreasonable. It is\r\nentirely probable that some of them are not in a life-bearing condition,\r\njust as a tree in your orchard may not have obtained maturity yet.\r\nTheir heyday is yet to come, perhaps this will be when the earth and all\r\nits present life are cold and dead--dead of old age! for a world must\r\ndie just as a man must die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are considered, he says, to be\r\nworlds of the future, their low density and other considerations leaving\r\nlittle doubt of their unripeness for life. Perhaps millions of\r\nyears will pass before these giant worlds are in a condition to welcome\r\nlife of any description.\r\n\r\nMany astronomers believe that the conditions for life such as we know it\r\non earth, are more likely to be found on Venus than on any other planet;\r\nothers think that Mars, being evolutionally older, may have even passed\r\nthe stage in which we now find ourselves, or that it may have developed,\r\nto suit the conditions on Mars, along quite a different line. Life\r\nadapts itself to many extremes, it may live in intense heat and freezing\r\ncold, in the air, in the water and under the ground. Speculation on this\r\nsubject has disclosed the most interesting data, but as yet we do not\r\nknow, and may never know, if there is life on any of the planets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT PLANET OF JUPITER, THE KING OF THE GODS\r\n\r\n_Diameter--88,300 miles_\r\n\r\n\r\nJupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. With high magnifying\r\npower it is seen to be a great \"orange-shaped\" globe, larger than the\r\nfull moon to the unaided eye, with a bulging equator and flattened\r\npoles. This polar depression is ¹⁄₁₆th of its diameter causing\r\nthe polar diameter of 84,400 miles to be several thousand miles less\r\nthan its equatorial diameter, which is 90,200 miles.\r\n\r\nThis colossal world is favorably situated for observation three months\r\nout of every year, traveling eastward along the zodiac, and spending\r\naround twelve months in each zodiacal constellation. It requires twelve\r\nof our years for Jupiter to complete a revolution around the sun.\r\n\r\nEven an opera-glass will give a view of Jupiter as a minute disk with\r\ntwo bands across its center and four luminous points on either side.\r\nThese luminous points are satellites, three of which are larger than our\r\nmoon and one almost as large. Jupiter has nine satellites in all\r\nbut only four are visible in any but the most powerful telescope and\r\nthree cannot be seen except in photographs. The four large satellites\r\nmay be seen to change their positions from hour to hour, occasionally\r\ndisappearing in the shadow behind Jupiter, and then reappearing with\r\nstartling abruptness on the other side.\r\n\r\n[Figure 149: THE PLANET JUPITER.\r\nPhotographed by Yerkes Observatory through the 40-inch refractor.]\r\n\r\nWith a stronger glass they may be seen moving as bright spots across the\r\nface of the planet, followed or preceded by the dark disks of their\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nWith a large telescope, various colored belts are seen to streak this\r\nglobe like dark stripes from east to west, the most prominent ones being\r\nthe two deep red bands some 7000 miles broad which lie on either side of\r\na faint golden equatorial belt, some 6000 miles across. Besides these,\r\nthere are lesser belts to the north and south which are red,\r\ngreen, brown, black and brilliant white. The spots on the equatorial\r\nbelt move rapidly toward the west with a speed of over 270 miles an\r\nhour, with respect to the other markings on the planet. By watching\r\nthese impressive colorings and markings the gigantic globe may actually\r\nbe seen to turn around on its axis! It does this in only 9 hours and 50\r\nminutes--less than half the time that it takes the earth to rotate.\r\n\r\nWith a still larger telescope, however, it was discovered that 9 hours\r\nand 50 minutes was only the average time that it takes Jupiter to rotate\r\nand that the day varies according to the location on the planet. Thus,\r\nlike the sun, its surface is not a fixed one, for at the equator the\r\nrate of rotation is 9 hours and 47 minutes, a little distance at either\r\nside 9 hours and 56 minutes, and in higher latitudes over 10 hours. But\r\nJupiter is not as hot a globe as the sun, which has been described as\r\nsomewhat resembling \"thick molasses,\" for if it shone by its own light\r\nit would not cast a shadow, nor would the shadows of its satellites be\r\ndark spots upon its surface.\r\n\r\nSuch facts have led to the general belief that Jupiter is still in an\r\nearly stage of development with its globe probably in a semi-fluid\r\ncondition so hot that the gases which will some day form its waters and\r\nbe cradled in the hollows of its crust, now rise as hot vapor into its\r\nthick, warm atmosphere and fall as incessant rains. The surface visible\r\nto us on earth must therefore be in the nature of dense clouds and\r\nvapors while its real surface is probably in a \"hot, muddy thickish\r\nliquid\" condition, quite unattractive to think about.\r\n\r\nYet there are some considerations that tend to disprove the cloud\r\ntheory. Barnard mentions that the semi-permanent nature often shown by\r\nthe markings is against it. The great Red Spot has been visible at\r\nintervals for a hundred years or more, and other markings may be traced\r\nwith but little change of form for months, although these objects\r\nare free to drift around and their rotation periods are not constant.\r\nProfessor Barnard, using the powerful Yerkes telescope, said that when\r\nseen under the finest conditions the appearance of the surface is more\r\nof a pasty nature.\r\n\r\nThe great oval-shaped spot mentioned above and famed as the \"Great Red\r\nSpot\" appeared in the southern hemisphere in 1878, or at least it\r\nappeared more distinctly on that date, for early drawings show that\r\ntraces of it had been observed long before that. It was at first of a\r\nvery strong red color and stretched above the equator for a distance of\r\n30,000 miles. It is now of a delicate pinkish tinge, extremely faint but\r\nstill visible.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this prominent marking is not known. It has been suggested\r\nthat it might have been a gigantic eruption. Gigantic indeed, if it\r\ncovered 30,000 miles! It also has a curious repellent nature, for all\r\nthe belts and spots that come near it, instead of passing onto it or\r\nover it, seem to be forcibly pushed to one side and held at a certain\r\ndistance until they have completely passed this whatever-it-is.\r\n\r\nIt has also been suggested that a new continent may be forming here, but\r\nthe fact that this feature like other features on Jupiter's apparent\r\nsurface does not seem to have a fixed position has caused it to be\r\nlikened rather to a vast drifting island. This \"vast drifting island\"\r\nsometimes moves fast, sometimes slowly and sometimes remains perfectly\r\nstationary! The last suggestion was brought forward before the more or\r\nless irregular drift was noticed which seems to prove after all that it\r\ncould not be a true part of the real surface of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIf Jupiter were composed of materials as dense and solid as the earth,\r\nhe would not be as large a planet as he now is. The materials of which\r\nthis great world is composed are only about one fourth as dense as the\r\nearth or 1.25 as dense as water.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 150: JUPITER AND FOUR OF HIS MOONS.\r\nPhotograph by the Yerkes Observatory.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe axis of the planet is nearly perpendicular to the plane of its\r\nmotion, the inclination being only about three degrees from the\r\nperpendicular. Thus there is no great variety of seasons on Jupiter\r\nalthough his year is twelve times as long as our year. If his axis were\r\ninclined as much to his ecliptic as the axis of the earth, his polar\r\nregions would remain in darkness for six years at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUPITER'S SATELLITES\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a telescope magnifying thirty-three times which he had constructed\r\nhimself, Galileo discovered the moons of Jupiter. Three of them were\r\nfirst seen on the 7th of January, 1610, and the fourth on the 13th of\r\nthe same month. These moons, which are sometimes called the \"Galilean\r\nquartet,\" were the first heavenly bodies which had not been known from\r\ntime immemorial.\r\n\r\nDelighted beyond measure, Galileo sent his drawings and an account of\r\nhis observations to his patron Cosmo de' Medici, Great Duke of Tuscany,\r\nin honor of whom he called the moons the \"Medician Stars.\" Equally\r\nanxious to show the world, Galileo set his telescope on the tower of St.\r\nMark where the advocates of the Copernican system hailed them with\r\njoyful satisfaction for here was a miniature of the sun and its planets\r\nhung up in the heavens to demonstrate the truth of the new doctrines.\r\nBut the stubborn followers of Ptolemy, viewing them argued that such\r\npretended discoveries were absurd, and that since we had seven openings\r\nin the head--two ears, two eyes, two nostrils and the mouth, there could\r\nbe in the heavens but seven planets. He had therefore either bewitched\r\nthem or the telescope, for which they threw him into prison.\r\n\r\nAfter the moons had finally been accepted as a fact, they were given the\r\nnames of Io, Europa and Callisto, three lovely maidens of whom the great\r\nOlympian God was fond, and Ganymede, his cupbearer, although astronomers\r\nusually designate them as I, II, III (Ganymede) and IV, in order\r\nof their distance from Jupiter. Their orbits lie in the plane of\r\nJupiter's equator and as that lies always in the plane of our vision,\r\nthe satellites seem to swing back and forth in their journey around him,\r\nsometimes in one position and sometimes in another--sometimes all four\r\non one side, sometimes two on one side and two on the other, or perhaps\r\none of them will be hidden by the planet. They present a different\r\naspect and relation to each other every successive evening and even in a\r\nfew hours may be seen to change. Frequently these moons may be seen as\r\nbright spots against the surface of the planet or their shadows appear\r\nas conspicuous round black spots traveling along one of the colorful\r\nbelts.\r\n\r\nGanymede, satellite III, is the largest of all known moons in the solar\r\nsystem, having a diameter of 3560 miles, actually exceeding the planet\r\nMercury in size. Satellite I exceeds our moon in diameter by a couple of\r\nhundred miles, satellites III and IV by over a thousand miles.\r\n\r\nIo, the satellite closest to Jupiter (named after the maiden who was\r\ntransformed into a cow and chased to the end of the world), is a very\r\nswiftly moving satellite, traveling completely around its orbit in 1\r\nday, 18 hours and 28 minutes. This means that it must move at the\r\ntremendous speed of 320 miles a minute! Our moon takes 27½ days or\r\nnearly a month to travel around the earth in an orbit of almost the same\r\nsize, but the attractive force of our earth is so much less than the\r\nattractive force of Jupiter that our moon does not have to travel so\r\nfast in order to keep from being pulled down on its surface.\r\n\r\nEuropa's period of revolution is 3 days, 13 hours and 14 minutes;\r\nGanymede's, 7 days, 3 hours and 43 minutes and Callisto's 16 days, 16\r\nhours and 32 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Professor Barnard discovered through the Lick telescope a moon\r\ncloser to Jupiter than Io. This little moon is only\r\n¹⁄₆₀₀th part as bright as the other satellites and is only 30\r\nmiles across.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 two other satellites were discovered by photography, still\r\nanother in 1908 and another in 1914, making a retinue of nine satellites\r\nin all. These last two, which are very remote from the planet, were\r\nfound to be revolving in the opposite direction from the other seven,\r\nwhich is from west to east, the direction that generally prevails\r\nthroughout the heavens. Other exceptions to this rule are the outermost\r\nmoon of the planet Saturn, the moon of Neptune and all four moons of\r\nUranus. The ninth moon of Jupiter is about 15,400,000 miles from the\r\nplanet and takes nearly 3 years to complete a revolution. Only 11 hours\r\nand 57 minutes for Barnard's satellite and nearly 3 years for the most\r\ndistant one, is quite a contrast in periods. Although Jupiter's 5-hour\r\nnight is rich in moons, he is not nearly as well supplied with moonlight\r\nas is the earth.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned how Roemer, a Danish astronomer of the\r\n17th century, discovered the finite velocity of light through the\r\ndisappearance and reappearance of Jupiter's satellites within his\r\nshadow. This was later found true through direct experiment.\r\n\r\nAt least a peep at this mammoth and colorful world, with its bands and\r\nspots and swiftly moving satellites, should be the privilege of every\r\nman, woman and child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMARS AND SATURN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED PLANET OF MARS, THE GOD OF WAR\r\n\r\n_Diameter--4230 miles_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE orbit of the little planet Mars, 141,000,000 miles from the sun,\r\nencompasses the orbits of Earth, Venus and Mercury, and forms the\r\nboundary line between the four inner planets and the planetoids or minor\r\nplanets. Beyond the planetoids are the four great planets, Jupiter,\r\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune.\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Mars is very eccentric, more eccentric, in fact, than any\r\nother planet in the solar system with the exception of Mercury. At its\r\nnearest approach to the earth's orbit it is only 35,000.000 miles away,\r\nwhile at its furthermost point it is distant 62,000.000 miles. The two\r\nplanets, however, when at different points in their orbits, may be over\r\n200,000,000 miles apart. This eccentricity in the orbit of our neighbor\r\nMars causes it to differ in brightness as we see it shining as a star,\r\nfor, although it is always large and beautiful, at its nearest approach\r\nto the earth it shines with more than tenfold the brilliancy of a first\r\nmagnitude star. At such a time its fiery light attracts the attention of\r\neveryone. Such extreme increase in light can only occur in the months of\r\nAugust and September and then only about every fifteen years. This was a\r\nmuch heralded astronomical event of the year 1924, when the two planets\r\nwere closer together than any other time during more than a hundred\r\nyears. However, Mars was low in the sky and not in such a good position\r\nfor observation as it will be two years from that date when at a\r\nhigher altitude, even though it will be at a greater distance from the\r\nearth. During shorter periods at intervals of two years and two months,\r\nthe earth passes between Mars and the sun; Mars then shines in our\r\nnight-sky as an especially red and lovely star with a well-illumined\r\nface just right for observation.\r\n\r\nMars is a much smaller globe than either the earth or Venus, but it is\r\nlarger than the planet Mercury.\r\n\r\n[Figure 151: MARS, SHOWING SURFACE MARKINGS AND POLAR CAPS.\r\nPhotographs by the Mount Wilson Observatory.]\r\n\r\nIts diameter of 4230 miles is only a little more than half that of the\r\nearth, although its period of rotation is almost the same, the earth\r\ngaining by two-thirds of an hour. Its day therefore is only about 40\r\nminutes longer than ours. The seasons of Mars are twice as long as ours,\r\nand its year equals 687 of our days, or 669 of its own.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Mars is very rare and thin, more rare and thin than\r\nthat surrounding the peak of Mount Everest, our highest mountain. Being\r\nless than one-fourth as dense as that found on the earth, one may see\r\nthrough it easily and discern the permanent markings on its\r\nsurface. The first thing one notices through a telescope is the ruddy\r\ncolor of its surface and the dark belt across the equatorial regions.\r\nThe ruddy color is presumed to be the characteristic color of its soil,\r\nfive-eighths of which is in a desert condition; there are also regions\r\nof other colors which are subject to change, and a white cap marking\r\neither pole.\r\n\r\nThe two white caps about the poles increase greatly during severe months\r\nof winter and vanish to small spots during the warmth of the Martian\r\nsummer. These are the reservoirs of moisture for the planet. A series of\r\nphotographs illustrating the phenomenon of the increase and decrease of\r\nthese caps is very interesting, for at the height of the Martian winter,\r\nfor instance, the north polar cap extends to the temperate zone while\r\nduring the summer it dwindles until it is but a tiny patch a few hundred\r\nmiles across. As the polar caps melt, they are bordered by a blue belt\r\nand this blue belt is only visible as the brilliant caps disappear.\r\nJudging from the same phenomena which are manifest on our earth, these\r\npolar caps were supposed to be snow. Through the aid of the\r\nspectroscope, they are now known to be snow.\r\n\r\nThe ruddy areas on Mars are interpreted as desert regions--great\r\nunfertile tracts of land but little affected by changes in climatic\r\nconditions, while the large irregular dark or blue-green regions are\r\nregarded as marshes or areas covered with vegetation, since they\r\ninvariably grow darker during the Martian summer and reveal themselves\r\nin massed colors changing from the initial blue-green to ocher and\r\nfinally to chocolate-brown. These changes follow the melting of the\r\npolar caps and each hemisphere undergoes the change in turn. Mars,\r\nhowever, is best known and famous for the theory of its so-called\r\n\"canals.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"canals\" were first observed by Schiaparelli, the distinguished\r\nItalian observer, in 1877. Schiaparelli thought that the dark irregular\r\nareas were oceans and that they were connected by these narrow\r\nstreaks which he called \"canale\" or \"channels.\" Unfortunately the word\r\nwas not translated as \"channels\" but as \"canals,\" which implies\r\nartificial construction, and this latter does therefore not convey the\r\nidea which the astronomer sought to convey. These black lines, or\r\n\"canale,\" are generally straight and although spoken of as narrow, must\r\nbe at least 12 miles in width and from a few hundred to three or four\r\nthousand miles in length. Starting from points near the polar caps, they\r\nfollow the arcs of great circles, proceeding to what seem to be centers\r\nin the middle of the continent where, most surprisingly, they meet other\r\nlines which have come to the same spots. Schiaparelli says that \"every\r\nchannel opens at its end either into a sea or into a lake or into\r\nanother channel, or else into the intersection of several other\r\nchannels.\" \"None of them as yet have been seen cut off in the middle of\r\na continent, remaining without beginning or without end ... by\r\npreference they converge toward the small spots which we have given the\r\nnames of lakes.\" These lakes are sometimes several hundred miles in\r\ndiameter, although many are very much smaller.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Lowell, splendidly equipped with an observatory 7000 feet\r\nabove sea-level in the clear air of Flagstaff, Arizona, maintained that\r\neach \"canal\" marked the route of a waterway, and that the visible mark\r\nis not the \"canal\" itself, but a broad band of vegetation irrigated from\r\na narrow channel. He studied and mapped 522 of these canals, 56 of which\r\nwere double. He also mapped the \"lakes\" which he called \"oases.\" Dr.\r\nLowell wrote a very interesting book on \"Mars as the Abode of Life\" as a\r\nresult of his observations. He explains the \"strips of vegetation\" in\r\nthis manner:\r\n\r\nSince Mars is fast approaching a desert condition, there is a great\r\nscarcity of water, the only reliable source of supply coming from the\r\nmelting of the snows at the polar caps. With the advance of spring\r\nthe white caps begin to recede and a dark band appears around the edge.\r\nThe water thus formed then flows away from the poles over the flat, dry\r\nsurface, collects in the greenish areas (which are probably marshes) and\r\nfrom there is led into the canals. These canals do not begin to appear\r\nuntil the snows begin to melt and are always in the same position each\r\nseason. The land is then moistened with water, the process starting near\r\nor around the melting polar caps and gradually moving down toward the\r\nequator. This water takes about 55 days to reach the equator, vegetation\r\nspringing up along the way. At the end of the season, the fresh green\r\nwithers and dies down. The spots, or oases, always connected by a canal\r\nto the rest of the dark area, appear and disappear, like the canals,\r\nwith seasonal changes. These start faint in tone as large as they are to\r\nbe, then darken throughout.\r\n\r\nSince the vivifying water advanced from the south pole toward the\r\nequator and also toward the equator from the north pole, Lowell\r\nconcluded that it must have some propelling force behind it, at least in\r\none direction. This presupposes the directing influence of an\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nAccepting the theory that Mars is inhabited by intelligent beings, it is\r\npresumed that the water resulting from the melting of the snow caps is\r\nconsciously controlled and turned over certain designated portions of\r\nits surface, otherwise the tremendous floods \"would prove more of a\r\ncurse than blessing.\" The picture is one of a high order of intelligent\r\nbeings realizing that their water is gradually disappearing and that\r\ntheir planet is rapidly becoming a desert, and who are struggling\r\nheroically to prolong its life. There are many objections to this\r\ntheory, but at least it is an interesting hypothesis presented by a\r\nnoted astronomer who possessed a splendid telescope erected in the clear\r\nair of Arizona, and who spent his life in a study of this planet.\r\n\r\nThe entire surface of Mars is about equal to the land surface of our\r\nearth. The density of the planet is only 73% that of the earth and the\r\nforce of gravity on its surface is 35% as great as on the surface of our\r\nworld. The lesser force of gravity, also the lower temperature and rare\r\natmosphere, would all have their influence on any life found on Mars\r\nwith the result that beings found there might be constituted physically\r\nin a very different way from ourselves. The temperature of Mars was\r\ncomputed lately at the Mount Wilson and the Lowell observatories and the\r\nresults obtained at the two observatories were in excellent agreement.\r\nAlthough it was found to be 94 degrees below zero at one pole and 96\r\ndegrees below zero at the other pole, the average temperature on other\r\nparts of the planet during the brightest parts of the day averages\r\nbetween 40 to 60 degrees F. This would be a livable temperature for life\r\nas we know it, although another fact is commented upon which might cause\r\ncurious complications. Since the blanket of air surrounding the planet\r\nis not of sufficient thickness to hold the heat on the planet, most of\r\nit may escape during the night-time, thus causing the temperature to\r\ndrop to over 112 degrees below zero. If intelligent life wished to\r\nsurvive from day to day it would have to hibernate, perhaps in heated\r\nunderground galleries, during the night half of its existence. The\r\nquestion as to whether or not there could be life on this planet has\r\nbeen hotly disputed by astronomers for years. It is certainly one of the\r\nmost interesting aspects of astronomy to the public at large. It is\r\noften argued that since Mars is smaller than the earth it must have\r\ncooled down millions of years before the earth reached a similar stage,\r\nand that its organic life must therefore be proportionally farther\r\nadvanced. Others have contended that it is past the age where it would\r\nbe able to support life of any kind.\r\n\r\nProfessor W. H. Pickering has advanced a new speculative theory called\r\n\"The Theory of Aerial Deposition.\" According to this theory the\r\nmajor canals are natural marshes fed by storm laden air currents. These\r\nmarshes furnish Mars a substitute for our oceans. Without them \"the\r\nwater evaporated from the summer pole would find its way too rapidly,\r\nthrough the natural general atmospheric circulation of the planet, to\r\nthe southern polar regions, where, wrapped at this season in the long\r\nwinter night and subjected to the cold of space, it would quickly be\r\nwithdrawn from further use in support of vegetal and perhaps animal\r\nlife. The function of the so-called canals or marshes in the economy of\r\nthe planet is in short to furnish a substitute for our oceans, and to\r\nfurnish by evaporation during the Martian summer a steady and continuous\r\nsupply of water after that derived from the northern snows has\r\nappreciably diminished.\" The above is quoted from a report on Mars by\r\nProfessor Pickering in the January number of _Popular Astronomy_, 1918.\r\nProfessor Pickering believes that the \"canals\" \"are either bands of\r\nmoistened soil or vegetation growing on moistened soil\" and that they\r\ncannot be anything else \"for we know of no solid in the mineral world\r\nthat darkens and then fades out in the sunlight.\" He does not think that\r\nthe major canals are necessarily the work of intelligent beings, but\r\nthey do serve the purpose of furnishing the northern hemisphere with a\r\nsupply of water in the form of natural marshes during the long northern\r\nsummer until the southern polar cap starts to melt at the coming of the\r\nautumnal equinox.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pickering, who has written a book called \"Mars,\" gives the\r\nfollowing interesting information as to how the planet appears through\r\nthe telescope at Flagstaff: \"We may examine the moon some night through\r\na small opera-glass. The sharpness and amount of detail visible in the\r\ntwo cases will be similar, although the appearance of the two bodies is\r\nquite unlike.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral public interest in Mars is probably keener than in any other\r\nplanet and since the great event of August 23rd, 1924, when Mars\r\nshone like a lantern in the sky, this interest will probably grow\r\ngreater than ever. This small matter of 34,648,000 miles--not much over\r\na third of the distance to the sun away from us--is almost as near as\r\nthe earth and Mars will ever approach one another.\r\n\r\nAn association of observers interested in Mars who are stationed in\r\ndifferent parts of the world has recently been formed. All parts of the\r\nplanet are now kept under inspection and regular reports are sent to a\r\ncentral bureau which publishes the results in an astronomical magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SATELLITES OF MARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following story is often related in connection with the satellites\r\nof Mars: Many years before the satellites were discovered, Swift, in\r\n\"Gulliver's Travels,\" described the little planet as having two moons,\r\none of which flew across the Martian sky three times a day! The thing\r\nseemed absurd, for never during all the explorations of the solar system\r\nhad a moon been found which behaved in such an erratic fashion.\r\nNevertheless, in 1877. Professor Asaph Hall, of Washington, discovered\r\ntwo tiny attendants to the planet of the War-god weaving \"like golden\r\nshuttles\" around the Martian orb, and one of these made three\r\nrevolutions in its orbit while the planet itself turned once on its\r\naxis! Thus the month of this surprising moon is less than eight hours\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThis little rapid-transit moon flies only 3700 miles above the planet's\r\nsurface, and, on account of the curvature of the globe it would not be\r\nvisible beyond 69 degrees of latitude on each side of the equator. As\r\nseen from Mars, it rises in the west and sets in the east, changing from\r\nnew to full one and a half times every night! With the constantly\r\nrecurring metamorphoses of this tiny moon, which is scarcely 7 miles in\r\ndiameter, and its most exceedingly rapid flight, it would seem\r\nthat there would be some reason in naming it Phobos (Fear), after one of\r\nMars' attendants. On account of its nearness to the surface of Mars,\r\nPhobos would appear to a Martian about the same size as our moon does to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe other moon, which was named Deimos (Terror), is about 14 miles in\r\ndiameter and is 12,500 miles from the planet. Its period is also very\r\nshort, being only 30 hours and 18 minutes. Since this period is only a\r\nfew hours more than the rotation period of Mars, the moon moves very\r\nslowly across the sky, remaining continuously above the horizon of any\r\ngiven place on the planet for more than 60 hours. It has been computed\r\nthat these two small moons would cause 1400 eclipses of the sun a year,\r\nas seen from Mars. They are the smallest objects visible in the sky, as\r\nseen from earth.\r\n\r\nOur month of March, as well as this fiery-hued planet, was named after\r\nthe War-god. Since Tuesday was also named after the War-god, it might be\r\nwell to mention here how the other days and months obtained their names.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Astrology, a \"science\" which was based on legends\r\nand myths, the names of the five planets then known were given to the\r\ndays of the week. Apollo, the Sun-god, gave his name to Sunday, and his\r\nsister, Goddess Diana, to Monday, and these two days retained their\r\nnames, but the days which followed those named for the sun and moon\r\nlater became Germanized, as it were, or the names of the originally\r\nimported gods translated into those of the Germanic divinities. Thus the\r\nname of the Northern Sword-god Tyr, who resembles the Roman War-god\r\nMars, was given the day of the week held sacred to Mars, now known as\r\n_Tuesday_, or Tiu's day, Mercury's day became Wodan's or _Wednesday_,\r\nJove's day was called Thor's or _Thursday_, and the day of Venus\r\ntransformed into _Friday_, the day of Freya, the wife of Wodan.\r\nThe day of Saturnus, retained under this name in some northern tongues,\r\nbecame a _langardage_, or a bathing day, in others. As for the\r\nmonths--_October_ and _February_ were names derived from Roman\r\nfestivals; a horse named October was sacrificed to the War-god Mars\r\nduring this month, while February derived its name from the Roman\r\nfestival Februalia, from _februare_, to purify. April, meaning Aprilis,\r\nfrom _aperire_ to open, obtained its name because it was the season when\r\nthe buds began to open. _September_ (septem, seven), _November_ (novem,\r\nnine), and _December_ (decern, ten) were the 7th, 9th and 10th months of\r\nthe year of the Roman calendar when the year consisted of 10 months.\r\n_January_ was named after Janus, the porter with the double head which\r\nenabled him to look back into the past and forward into the future;\r\n_May_ after Maia, one of the Pleiades; and _June_, after Juno, Queen of\r\nthe gods and the Goddess of Marriage. Quintilis, the 5th month of the\r\nRoman year, which began in March, was named _July_ in honor of Julius\r\nCæsar, while the 6th month, which was originally styled Sextilis,\r\nreceived its present name, _August_, from the Emperor Augustus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RINGED PLANET OF SATURN, THE GOD OF TIME\r\n\r\n_Diameter--73,700_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Jupiter is the largest planet and Mars the most interesting\r\nplanet, the planet Saturn, as seen through a large telescope, is the\r\nmost uniquely beautiful creation that man has ever beheld. The spectacle\r\nof a huge silvery ball surrounded by an equally huge and silvery ring\r\nsuddenly disclosed in the midst of the darkness, is such an astounding\r\nsurprise that one can never forget the strange sensations experienced\r\nwhen first beholding it.\r\n\r\nSaturn moves very slowly through the sky, traveling on the average\r\nonly about one degree a month and spending two or three years in each\r\nzodiacal constellation. This is because its pathway lies millions of\r\nmiles beyond that of Jupiter's, and is so large that it takes the planet\r\n29½ years to complete its circuit around the sun.\r\n\r\nSaturn is believed to be composed mainly of gases and vapors or to be at\r\nleast in a fluid condition with no solid crust. Its density is less than\r\nthat of any other planet in the solar system, being only 0.70 as\r\ncompared with water as unity. This is only about one-half as great as\r\nthe density of Jupiter, which is somewhat greater than that of water.\r\nThe weight of the earth is five and one-half times that of water. If the\r\nearth and Saturn were two balls immersed in an ocean large enough to\r\nhold them, the earth would sink like a ball of metal while Saturn would\r\nfloat like a ball of wood.\r\n\r\nA white belt may usually be seen near the equator of Saturn and curious\r\npale gray caps cover both the poles. Between these are faint colors and\r\nother dim belts. Its colors as markings are not as pronounced as in the\r\ncase of Jupiter, on which they are far more distinct as this latter\r\nplanet is 400,000,000 miles closer to the earth. The mysterious gray\r\ncolor of the caps at the poles of Saturn remain an enigma and the\r\nspectroscope shows that Saturn contains some substance which has not yet\r\nbeen identified.\r\n\r\nSaturn's equator is inclined to the plane of its orbit at an angle of\r\n27 degrees--a direct contrast to the axis of Jupiter which is almost\r\nperpendicular. This would cause Saturn to have very marked seasonal\r\nchanges and very long seasons for one of its years is equal to almost 30\r\nof ours.\r\n\r\nDay and night on Saturn are very short for this huge planet turns\r\ncompletely around in 10¼ hours. With only 5⅛ hours of daylight (and\r\nSaturn receives only ¹⁄₉₀th as much light per unit area as that\r\nreceived by the earth), one would hardly get up before it was time\r\nto go to bed. But perhaps the future Saturnian will be so constructed\r\nthat he does not have to spend so many hours in sleep, or perhaps, as in\r\nthe Golden Age when the god Saturn ruled on earth and the needs of man\r\nwere brought forth without labor, this length of day would be quite\r\nenough for general entertainment. Again, they might be such quick-witted\r\ncreatures that they could accomplish a thing while we were thinking\r\nabout it, or, yet again, they might not care to slave all their days in\r\norder to indulge in such foolishly complex lives as we do here and 5⅛\r\nhours would prove a great plenty. How we do ramble on! Yet is it not a\r\nlittle fun to stop a moment and conjecture about folks on a distant\r\nworld? Perhaps they could never be--perhaps Saturn may never mature into\r\na habitable globe--but then, who knows?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RINGS OF SATURN\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn H. Thayer in his interesting article on Saturn in _Popular\r\nAstronomy_, March, 1919, says: \"If you want to see a picture painted as\r\nonly the hand of God can paint it, go with me to Saturn.\" He then\r\nbeautifully describes the scene of the wonderful band of silvery light\r\nwhich arches the sky near the equator, and the bewildering panorama of\r\nmany moons, full round disks, quarter phases and thin crescents\r\ndisplayed in the Saturnian nights. Not only would the nights be\r\nstartling to an earth-being; during the daytime their tiny sun would\r\nskim across the sky at the rate of about the distance of the diameter of\r\nthe moon in every minute, and then after the sun literally dropped below\r\nthe horizon, the stars and crescents and disks and quarters of moons\r\nwould shoot across equally fast.\r\n\r\nSuppose all the inhabitants of the solar system were forced to exist in\r\na medium like the ocean, for instance, to know nothing of such celestial\r\nscenes; perhaps the unfortunate inhabitants of Venus can see no\r\nmore clearly through that dense atmosphere which surrounds their globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One might think that the atmosphere was made transparent with this\r\ndesign, to give man in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of\r\nthe sublime. If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years,\r\nhow would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the\r\nremembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night\r\ncome out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their\r\nadmonishing smile.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Emerson._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crowning glory of Saturn, its thin flat ring, is poised above the\r\nhuge body without in any way touching it. Although this ring appears as\r\na solid piece, it is now known positively that it is made up of swarms\r\nof meteors or exceedingly minute satellites, all whirling round and\r\nround Saturn in the same plane. It may easily be seen why a brightly\r\nswirling mass of these shining moons would seem as one object at such a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThrough a large telescope it becomes apparent that Saturn's ring is\r\nreally composed of three rings lying one inside of the other, the two\r\nouter rings, which are about 11,000 and 18,000 miles in width, being\r\nseparated by a dark, narrow clean-cut space of about 2200 miles.\r\n\r\nThe third ring is a thin, faint inner ring, so transparent that the\r\nplanet may be seen shining through it. It is about the same width as the\r\nouter ring, 11,000 miles, and its inner edge lies only 6000 miles above\r\nthe surface of the planet. This inner ring is called the \"crape ring\"\r\nbecause it has a dusky look. It is believed to be the inner ring\r\nthinning off toward the planet. It has been suggested that the crape\r\nring may have originated from collisions of particles in the bright\r\nring, thus reducing their orbits, and that the rings of Saturn are\r\nslowly shrinking down upon the planet and will sometimes in the future\r\nhave entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure 152: TWELVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF SATURN, MADE WITH A 60-INCH\r\nREFLECTING TELESCOPE.\r\nPhotographs by the Mount Wilson Observatory.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first individual to gain a glimpse of Saturn's rings was Galileo. To\r\nGalileo, whose telescope was not much superior to the field-glass of\r\ntoday, the planet appeared triple with two outer stars touching the\r\nmiddle star \"like two servants assisting old Saturn to complete his\r\njourney.\" A few years later when he again turned his telescope upon\r\nSaturn, these attendant orbs had disappeared. \"It is possible some demon\r\nmocked me,\" he exclaimed, and would look no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"But for these news I know not what they be,\r\n    Some one perhaps has lit on a new vein\r\n    Of stars in Heaven:\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Bailey._\r\n\r\n\r\nLater the side features reappeared and became larger and larger, until\r\nthey fitted the globe \"like a pair of handles.\"\r\n\r\n[Figure 153: This drawing shows the rings of Saturn opened to their\r\nfullest extent, as seen on July 7, 1898, by Prof. E. E. Barnard through\r\nthe 40-inch refractor at the Yerkes Observatory.]\r\n\r\nThe drawings of those days look very strange to us now, for some\r\npictured a bar run through the planet or a ball with ears. Fifty years\r\nlater, in 1656, Huygens, with his 123-foot tubeless telescope, solved\r\nthe mystery and proved the existence of a thin, disconnected ring, which\r\nwas as astounding a phenomenon as the ears or bars or handles.\r\n\r\nProof by direct observation that the ring was neither liquid nor\r\nsolid but a multitude of very small bodies journeying close together,\r\nwas made by Professor Keeler when he applied the spectroscope to\r\ndetermine the velocity at which the rings rotate. It was then discovered\r\nthat the inner parts revolved more rapidly than the outer parts and the\r\nonly way in which such a phenomenon can be explained is to accept the\r\nhypothesis that the rings are composed of separate independent bodies.\r\n\r\nEvery 15 years the plane of the ring passes through the plane of the\r\nearth and hence it is seen edgewise to the earth. It then almost\r\ndisappears, being so thin as to be seen only in the larger telescopes.\r\n\r\n[Figure 154: The Earth might \"roll upon this ring like a ball upon a\r\nroad.\" (Aspects of Saturn's Rings.) From Comstock's \"Textbook on\r\nAstronomy,\" by permission of publishers, D. Appleton & Co.]\r\n\r\nSeen edgewise through the 40-inch Yerkes telescope, it is scarcely more\r\nthan a streak of light \"like a pair of illuminated needles piercing the\r\nball on opposite sides.\" This is because all of these tiny moons which\r\nfly about Saturn are moving in the same plane. We obtained this edgewise\r\nview in 1907; in 1915 the ring was opened at its widest extent while in\r\n1921 it was again almost invisible.\r\n\r\nThe reason that this ring may be observed at so many angles is because\r\nit is inclined about 27 degrees to the plane of the planet's orbit and\r\nabout 28 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. In the course of the\r\nearth's journey and Saturn's journey around the sun, we sometimes look\r\nup at this ring and sometimes down upon it, but when the earth lies\r\nexactly in the same plane, we look only on the edge which is so thin\r\nthat it becomes almost invisible. The thickness of the ring is, indeed,\r\nscarcely anything at all in comparison to its width for, although\r\nthe distance from one side to the other of the entire ring is about\r\n172,000 miles, its edge is estimated as only about 62 miles.\r\n\r\nWhen the rings are open, the dark shadow of Saturn's planet may be seen\r\nagainst the light of these rings.\r\n\r\n\r\n          \"While Saturn whirls, his steadfast shade\r\n    Sleeps on his luminous ring.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shadow proves that the dull, yellowish glow on the planet is\r\nreflected sunlight, and that the planet does not shine with its own\r\nlight, as a star.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOONS OF SATURN\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides all the tiny moonlets in the beautiful ring, ten large moons\r\nwhirl about the planet Saturn. These give Saturn a system with a radius\r\nof 8 million miles, which is quite extensive compared to the earth and\r\nmoon system which has a radius of 240,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe moons of Saturn range in size from about 200 miles to nearly 300\r\nmiles in diameter but being so far away only Titan, the largest, can be\r\nseen except in a large telescope. These satellites were given the names\r\nof the brothers and sisters of the God of Time and are called Mimas,\r\nEnceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, Japetus, Phœbe and\r\nThemis.\r\n\r\nTitan, the largest satellite, is 771,000 miles distant from the planet.\r\nThe nearest one is only 117,000 miles away but there are also three\r\nothers which are closer to the planet than our moon is to us. Phœbe,\r\nthe most distant one, is almost 8,000,000 miles away and takes nearly 18\r\nmonths to make a revolution. It appears as a full moon only once in a\r\nyear and a half--quite a contrast to Mars' little Phobos who goes\r\nthrough his phases one and a half times every night! Phœbe seems\r\nto be possessed with a streak of contrariness for she moves in her orbit\r\naround Saturn in the opposite direction from all of the other moons.\r\n\r\nJapetus, the second largest satellite, has the interesting peculiarity\r\nof appearing three or four times as bright when on the western side of\r\nSaturn as when on the eastern side of it. This is explained by the\r\nsupposition that one of its sides has a greater reflecting power than\r\nthe other and, like our moon, always has the same side toward its\r\nplanet. We would, therefore, see one side of it when east of Saturn and\r\nthe other side of it when west of it.\r\n\r\nThemis, the tenth moon, was first recognized by W. H. Pickering in 1905\r\nbut it is only recently that its discovery was fully confirmed.\r\nProfessor Pickering also discovered the ninth moon of Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMERCURY, URANUS AND NEPTUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TINY PLANET OF MERCURY, THE MESSENGER OF THE GODS\r\n\r\n_Diameter--3030 miles_\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY, the smallest and fleetest and hottest of the planets, shines as\r\na star of the first magnitude. It lies closer to the sun than any other\r\nplanet, which increases the difficulty of studying it. Most of the time\r\nit is either hidden behind the sun or is passing between us and the sun,\r\nand the only time when it is observable is when it is to the east or the\r\nwest of the sun. Indeed it is so often hidden or lost in the brightness\r\nof the sun that it is rarely seen except by a professional astronomer.\r\n\r\nLike Venus, Mercury is seen first on one side of the sun and then on the\r\nother. In the early spring it appears in the west almost invisible in\r\nthe twilight; in the early autumn, in the east as a morning star just\r\npreceding or mingled in the rays of the dawn. It is always seen very\r\nclose to the eastern or western horizon, never more than two hours\r\nbefore the sun in the morning nor more than two hours after it in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nBecause of the great inclination of the orbit of Mercury, it is seen in\r\na transit across the face of the sun not more than thirteen times in a\r\nhundred years. This transit may only be seen in a telescope. If it so\r\nhappens that it travels across the center of the sun, the journey\r\nconsumes about eight hours, although the little black dot is skimming\r\nacross the big, bright disk at the rate of 100,000 miles an hour. The\r\nnext five transits will occur on November 8th, 1927; May 10th,\r\n1937; November 12th, 1940; May 13th, 1953, and November 6th, 1960.\r\n\r\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of Mercury is so pronounced that its\r\ngreatest and least distance from the sun varies nearly 15,000,000 miles.\r\nThis causes considerable variation in the speed of this planet, for as\r\nthe sun does not lie in the center of the orbit but at one focus, it is\r\nnot compelled to go as fast on the far side as on the side nearest to\r\nthis tremendous mass. Being so close to the great attracting force of\r\nthe sun, it is however, forced to move faster than any other planet in\r\nthe solar system in order that the right balance of speed may be\r\nobtained to counteract the gravitational pull which would otherwise draw\r\nhim instantly to the burning surface. Mercury's average rate of speed\r\naround its orbit is 35 miles a second. Neptune, seventy-five times as\r\nfar off, feels so much less this relentless pull that it can roll\r\nleisurely along at the comfortable rate of 3.4 miles a second with no\r\nfear of being drawn to destruction.\r\n\r\nMercury completes his orbit in 88 days and this is, of course, the\r\nlength of his year. During this journey he always turns the same face to\r\nthe sun. The heat on this side must therefore be terrible and the\r\nsurface unmercifully scorched and possibly cracked. Moreaux, a French\r\nastronomer, thinks that it may even be so hot that it has oceans of lead\r\nand molten tin. A few features are discernible, and although faint,\r\nthese features are fixed. The general impression gained is that the tiny\r\nplanet is barren, rough and mountainous, bleak, seared and desolate,\r\nwith one side sweltering in terrific heat and the other numbed with dark\r\nand cold. Since there is no appreciable atmosphere on Mercury, there\r\nmust be no wind--no warm currents of air to flow from the hot side to\r\nthe cold side, nor from the cold side to the hot side,--thus making what\r\nis already drear seem motionless and dead.\r\n\r\nYet there is often some alleviating quality to make the drear seem\r\nless drear. For instance, a slight exception may be taken to the\r\nstatement that the day side of Mercury is always day and the night side\r\nalways night. As an effect of libration, an oscillatory movement of the\r\nplanet on its axis, there is a strip of ground on either side, where the\r\ndark and light hemispheres meet, upon which the sun rises and shines for\r\n44 days and then sets, leaving it in 44 days of darkness. This strip of\r\nground is 23½ angular degrees in breadth and enjoys a true day,\r\nalthough its \"day\" is as long as its year, and is equal to 88 of our\r\nearth-days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE PLANET OF URANUS, THE ANCIENT GOD OF\r\nTHE HEAVENS\r\n\r\n_Diameter--32,000 miles_\r\n\r\n\r\nMercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter have been known since antiquity but\r\nUranus was the first planet to be discovered with the aid of a\r\ntelescope. This planet was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel while\r\nmapping stars, and the very fact of its existence astounded the world.\r\nBecause Galileo had named the satellites of Jupiter the Medician Stars\r\nafter his patron, Herschel wished to name his newly discovered planet\r\nGeorgium Sidus, in honor of George the Third. But foreign astronomers\r\nwould not agree to this and until a name was decided upon, called the\r\nplanet Herschel. Later, the planet was called Uranus after the most\r\nancient of all the deities, and its sign was the sign of the world hung\r\non the initial of Herschel. H In appreciation of the fact that he had\r\ndiscovered a planet, Herschel was made private astronomer to his king\r\nand later knighted.\r\n\r\nUranus is the smallest of the major planets and ranks next to the earth\r\nin size, which is the largest of the minor planets, yet there is a great\r\ndifference in the size of these two planets, for the diameter of\r\nthe earth is only 7927 miles, while that of Uranus is 32,000 miles.\r\nThere is also as great a difference in the nature of these two worlds.\r\n\r\nUranus travels through space in an orbit at an average distance of\r\n1,771,000,000 miles from the sun, encompassing the orbits of Saturn,\r\nJupiter, the Planetoids, Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury; an orbit so\r\nlarge that it takes the planet 84 years to complete its journey around\r\nthe sun. It has only been a year and a half, according to time figured\r\non Uranus, since Herschel first introduced this planet to\r\nearth-dwellers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the year of Uranus is 84 of our years long, which causes long\r\nand remarkable seasons, its day is very short, for the planet turns so\r\nrapidly on its axis that it sees both day and night in 10 hours and 50\r\nminutes. Even the few hours of daylight it enjoys are not very bright\r\nones, or warm ones either, for the planet is so far from the sun (which\r\nappears as an intense point of light), that it receives only\r\n¹⁄₃₇₀th as much light and heat as we do on earth.\r\n\r\nThe axis of Uranus is tipped 98 degrees from the perpendicular which\r\ncauses not only extreme but peculiar seasonal changes. Since the axis of\r\nthe planet is always pointing in the same direction and at one place in\r\nits 84-year journey points almost directly at the sun, each pole in turn\r\nis bathed in 42 years of dim daylight and then, when on the other side\r\nof the orbit, sleeps through a night that is just as long. Bürgel\r\nremarks that \"an inhabitant born at the beginning of winter and dying at\r\nthe age of forty, would never see daylight, or the sun, but live in\r\neverlasting darkness like the pit-ponies in coal mines. The contrary\r\nwould be the case with the summer-born, who would know of night and the\r\nstars only from hearsay.\" Quite different from what life might enjoy on\r\nJupiter, for Jupiter's axis is inclined only 3 degrees from the\r\nperpendicular and its year would be almost a perpetual spring.\r\n\r\nCareful observations seem to indicate that Uranus is a gaseous body,\r\nalthough cooler and more solid than Saturn and Jupiter. This planet is\r\nimmersed in an exceedingly dense atmosphere quite different in\r\nconstitution from the light, diaphanous covering of air which encloses\r\nthe ball of the earth. This is indicated by the broad absorption band in\r\nits spectrum.\r\n\r\nUranus is attended by four moons but these are too far away for us to\r\nobserve in any detail. Herschel discovered two of these soon after the\r\nplanet was discovered, and they were given the names of Titania and\r\nOberon. In 1851, Lassel of Liverpool discovered two more which were\r\ncalled Ariel and Umbriel. Two of these moons are seen with great\r\ndifficulty even with the aid of the most powerful telescopes. The orbits\r\nof these moons are tipped nearly perpendicular to the plane of the\r\norbits of the earth and Uranus, and their movements are retrograde as\r\nregards most of the known movements of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThis strange planet of the most ancient God of the Heavens is now\r\nvisible during the spring and summer months as a faint, greenish star of\r\nthe 6th magnitude, but it is rather difficult to locate unless the\r\nobserver is an experienced astronomer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOUNDARY PLANET OF NEPTUNE, THE GOD OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n_Diameter--35,000 miles_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of Uranus in 1781, its pathway among the stars of\r\nthe sky was carefully noted and geometers were not long in fitting it\r\nwith an orbit. In a few years, however, it was noted that the planet was\r\nout of its computed orbit by a distance as great as the moon's distance\r\nfrom the earth. The deviations attracted general attention and popular\r\nopinion feared that the new planet, being so far from the center of the\r\nsolar system, was breaking away from the sun's control. But a\r\nyoung mathematician, J. C. Adams, and a few months later an older and\r\nexperienced mathematical astronomer, Leverrier, conceived a more logical\r\nsolution of the mystery, and decided that they would search beyond\r\nUranus and see if there was not a planet which was attracting Uranus and\r\ncausing irregularities in the great world's motion. This was a\r\ntremendous task, for not only was it necessary to calculate the orbit of\r\nthe hypothetical planet, but also the weight and speed that such a\r\nplanet would have in order to pull Uranus in exactly the way that it was\r\nbeing perturbed. After much hard work the problem was satisfactorily\r\nsolved by each man independently.\r\n\r\nChallis at Oxford, following the computations of Adams, first commenced\r\nto search in the place where these indicated that the planet might be\r\nfound, and on August 4th, 1846, actually saw and mapped the star but did\r\nnot recognize its planetary character. On the 23rd of September, 1846,\r\nGalle of Berlin, searching at the place indicated by Leverrier, found\r\nthe new world at almost the exact place indicated by the computations!\r\nThis should satisfy the most skeptical as to the validity of the great\r\nNewtonian law of gravitation and the accuracy of the mathematical\r\ndeductions therefrom. To prove the existence of a planet and to\r\ndetermine its position before it was ever seen, is considered by\r\nscientists to be among the most amazing intellectual achievements ever\r\nrecorded in history.\r\n\r\nNeptune requires 165 years to complete a revolution around the sun. The\r\nboundary line of the solar system, which is the planet's orbit, is a\r\ntremendously long pathway on which to travel, for it lies at a distance\r\nof 2,775,000,000 miles from the sun.\r\n\r\nThe length of a day on Neptune is not known as it lies too far away to\r\npermit an observer to distinguish any permanent surface features even\r\nwith the largest telescopes.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that as Neptune is so far away from the sun, it\r\nreceives only ¹⁄₉₀₀th as much light and heat as our earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"When the keen north wind with all its fury blows,\r\n    Congeals the floods, and forms the fleecy snows,\r\n    'Tis heat intense to what can there be known;\r\n    Warmer our poles than is its burning zone.\r\n    Who there inhabit must have other powers,\r\n    Juices, and veins, and sense, and life, than ours.\r\n    One moment's cold, like theirs, would pierce the bone,\r\n    Freeze the heart's blood, and turn us all to stone.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Baker's Universe._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun, as viewed from Neptune, would look very small, not much larger\r\nthan Venus does to us when she is nearest the earth, although he gives\r\nto Neptune 250,000 times more light than Venus gives to us at her best.\r\n\r\nNeptune possesses only one known satellite. This satellite has the\r\npeculiarity of whirling much as if it had been tipped over through an\r\nangle of 150 degrees, which causes it to move in a direction opposite to\r\nthat in which the planets travel around the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLANET AT CLOSE RANGE\r\n\r\n_Diameter--7927 miles_\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUMES could not cover the extremely complex history of the earth, nor\r\npicture with justice the exquisite construction of even its smallest\r\nfeatures. It is here that the astronomer puts away his glass and turns\r\ndetective with the geologist on his own home ground.\r\n\r\nAstronomers, basing their computations of the earth's age upon the rate\r\nat which the sun is shrinking or contracting, have placed it at\r\n25,000,000 years, but geologists claim that this is too short a time to\r\naccount for the enormous thickness of stratified deposits, the salinity\r\nof the ocean, and other similar evidence which seems to prove that it is\r\nprobably 100,000,000 years old, or even older. Later estimates based\r\nupon other modes of production of solar heat may extend this estimate\r\nseveral hundred fold.\r\n\r\nThe moon is believed by some to have once been a part of the earth and\r\nthat it was formed through a division of the earth's ball when our world\r\nwas in an early stage of evolution. Becoming two separated bodies, they\r\nhave remained bound together by mutual attraction, and thus move around\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Nebular Hypothesis expounded by La Place, the earth and\r\nmoon once shone like stars but, through the long ages of time they have\r\ngradually cooled, and, their lights extinguished, two cold-surfaced\r\nglobes now wend their way around the sun.\r\n\r\n[Figure 155: THE EARTH, SEEN FROM A DISTANCE.\r\n(Used by permission of the publishers, Rand McNally & Company,\r\nfrom Dodge's \"Elementary Geography.\")]\r\n\r\nThe smaller of these two globes is now scarred and old but the other is\r\nstill fresh with sparkling waters, green verdure, and is teeming with\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAccording to the later and more generally accepted Planetesimal Theory\r\nof Moulton and Chamberlain, these globes were cold in the beginning but\r\nbecame hot through compression as the material of which they were\r\ncomposed was drawn toward their centers by the pull of gravitation.\r\n\r\nThe four outer planets are mostly gaseous; the four inner ones have\r\nhardened crusts. Let us scan for a moment the various surface features\r\nof the third one in order from the sun,--the Earth, our own globe, and\r\nconsider the unique and marvelous manner in which its various features\r\nhave come to be.\r\n\r\nIn the course of millions of years, the earth, through the pull of\r\ngravitation, became gradually more and more dense. Different elements in\r\nits gases (which according to the later theory were squeezed out by\r\npressure), combined to form rock, water and atmosphere. Hydrogen united\r\nwith oxygen formed water; nitrogen, oxygen and small quantities of\r\ncarbonic acid gas formed the atmosphere; oxygen mixed with silicon made\r\nquartz, the earth's first rock. This rock, called granite, rose to the\r\ntop of the molten liquid material and formed a thin film of crust, for\r\nit was lighter than the metallic substance which sank to form the\r\nearth's core.\r\n\r\nThis thin, rocky film of crust which covered the hot liquid matter was\r\nat first so hot that the gases which had formed the water could not stay\r\non its surface but rose in the air as steam. After the temperature\r\nbecame lower and the rocks cooled, rain poured down in sheets of water,\r\nremained on the crust and formed a warm sea.\r\n\r\nFor a long time this film was but a slight obstruction to the raging\r\nfiery forces confined beneath it and again and again these forces tore\r\nthe crust asunder and made the surface of the earth a scene of wild\r\ncommotion. But each time the cooling gained a slight mastery over\r\nthe heat, and by cooling the earth's film was continually shrinking thus\r\nforming a thicker and more solid protective crust. After an heroic\r\nstruggle between these mighty forces the crust was at last strong enough\r\neven to sink down in places to fit the inner core; the sea then ran into\r\nthese hollows and into the wrinkles formed from the shrinking, and the\r\nfirst ridges or islands appeared above the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThese ridges or islands were then attacked by the elements, eroded by\r\nthe weather and the rains, and the granite which formed them was\r\ncrumbled into quartz, feldspar and mica. The torrents of rain formed\r\nrivers, and these, seeking a level, carried the debris down to the\r\nshores of the ridges,--the finer sediment, the feldspar and mica, being\r\nwashed far out from the rocky land where it settled to the bottom of the\r\nsea and in time formed which under pressure turned to clay, while the\r\nclay under greater pressure, turned to slate. The quartz of the granite,\r\nground to fine particles, stayed near the shore and formed sandy\r\nbeaches, which if covered under great pressure, became sandstone. Thus\r\nwere some of our various rocks formed from the original rock of granite,\r\nand no matter where one sees sandstone or claybanks, even if on top of a\r\nmountain, such a place was once under water, for that is the only place\r\nwhere such sedimentary material could form.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The sound of streams that swift and slow,\r\n    Draw down Æonian hills, and sow\r\n    The dust of continents to be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis slow disintegration of the earth's first land continued for\r\nmillions of years, the waste accumulating along the shores, and as far\r\nout as the finer sediment could be carried. Finally the pressure on the\r\nedges of this land caused the thin crust to soften and break, the molten\r\nmagma poured forth in great masses, and the thick sediments were smashed\r\ntogether, folded up and thrust upward to form the earth's _first hills_.\r\n\r\n[Figure 156: A PORTION OF THE COLUMBIAN LAVA FLOW IN THE STATE\r\nOF WASHINGTON.\r\nPhotograph by Asahel Curtis, Seattle.]\r\n\r\nThe crust was then so thin and easily broken that only low hills\r\nappeared but after it became thicker it was not so easily rent and\r\n_mountain ranges_ were born with an accompanying roar of tremendous\r\nvolcanoes. Geologists, studying the ages of the different ranges in the\r\nUnited States, have concluded that the first to appear were the\r\nAppalachian mountains; later the Rocky mountains in the west, and still\r\nlater the Coast ranges. Mountain ranges are invariably found along lines\r\nof very thick sediments. The same strata which along the Appalachian\r\nrange are 40,000 feet thick, thin out, when traced westward, to only\r\n4000 feet at the Mississippi River.[1] The high tablelands in portions\r\nof Idaho, Oregon and Washington were formed by great streams of lava\r\nwhich poured through many of the fissures of the coast ranges and buried\r\nthe whole country above the hill tops. This lava cooled into thick\r\nmassive layers of solid rock--an interesting sight to this very day.\r\n\r\nAlthough mountain ranges appear amid violence and their growth, in a\r\ngeologic sense, is rapid, _plains_ and _plateaus_ are illustrations of\r\nsea-bottoms which have been covered with sediment carried down from the\r\nmountains,--mainly pebbles, sand and clay,--pressed and cemented\r\ntogether under the water and then gently raised to the surface.\r\nSometimes the sea-bottom is exposed as a vast plain; again the strata\r\nare upheaved, bent or broken, forming faults and ridges. Many of the\r\nelevated plains and plateaus are later sculptured into hills by rains,\r\nwinds, frosts and rivers. The hills are then gently torn down, the\r\nvalleys filled up and the sediment again deposited by the rivers upon\r\nthe bed of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For every valley shall be exalted and every mountain shall be laid low.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA few million years passed by and these same deposits may again be\r\nraised and become dry land. _The great stretches of land between\r\nthe mountains of the eastern and western portion of America_ were formed\r\nfrom the sediment washed down from these mountains and deposited in the\r\nsea which lay between.\r\n\r\nThe crust of the earth is still rising and sinking, the land gaining on\r\nthe water, but as this is usually such a slow movement, it can only be\r\ntraced through a period of many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The notion that the ground is naturally steadfast is an error. The idea\r\nof terra firma belongs with the ancient belief that the earth was the\r\ncenter of the universe. It is, indeed, by their mobility that the\r\ncontinents survive the increasing assaults of the ocean waves, and the\r\ncontinuous down-wearing which the rivers and glaciers bring about.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Professor Shaler._\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly the whole of Sweden and Norway, for instance, has been rising for\r\nthousands of years. This is proved by the fact that old sea-beaches full\r\nof shells of species now living in neighboring seas, are found from\r\nfifty to seventy miles inland, and several hundred feet above the\r\npresent sea-level on both sides of the Scandinavian peninsula.[2] Such\r\nsea-beaches are found high above the present water level in Chile and\r\nPatagonia, and the chalk cliffs of England were formed under the waves\r\nof the ocean. Le Conte says that one of the most evident proofs of\r\ncrustal movements in ancient geologic times is the great thickness of\r\nshallow water sediments (sandstones, shales and limestones) over the\r\ngreater portions of all of the continents, which represent areas of slow\r\nsubsidence; and the great breaks or unconformities between the series\r\nof strata, which represent areas of uplift and atmospheric erosion.\r\n\r\nAlthough sand and gravel are distributed over the bottom of the ocean\r\nnear the land, dredging expeditions reaching down their metal cylinders\r\nfor samples of the sea-floor at greater depths in various sections of\r\nthe globe, have discovered that it is of a different composition,\r\none-third of its area being covered with red clay. _Red clay_ is\r\ncomposed of iron and silica and represents all that is left of the\r\nminute shells which cover the tiny sea-animals which flourish in such\r\ncountless multitudes throughout the ocean. These shells, after the\r\nanimal dies, drift downward in ceaseless showers and the lime, of which\r\nthey are largely composed, is dissolved during the long journey to the\r\nbottom. \"_Ooze_\" is found in water less deep and is formed by the\r\naccumulation of minute shells of different species. Minute shells of the\r\nsame species have formed great thicknesses of limestone or of chalk even\r\nas grains of sand build in time their banks of sandstone. Such\r\ninformation as this is, of course, disclosed by the penetrating eye of\r\nthe microscope. Chalk cliffs, now dry land, form thousands of miles of\r\nhabitable land in Europe, while coral sand pressed into rock forms the\r\nunique foundation of the Bahama Islands, the Bermudas, many islands of\r\nthe Pacific, and the Great Barrier Reef extending for a thousand miles\r\nalong the shores of northern Australia!\r\n\r\nLooking again about our own country on the land that lies cradled\r\nbetween the eastern and the western mountains of the United States, one\r\ncannot help but regard with awe the magnificent stretches of time it\r\nmust have taken for this great area to have been formed beneath the sea.\r\nThis alone proves the great age of the earth. Because it was raised\r\nslowly, the strata lie there little disturbed, one over the other, \"like\r\nthe leaves of a great stone book,\" containing the history of the earth.\r\nA good view of the river strata may be obtained in the canyon of the\r\nColorado river, for this mighty river has carved a bed through the\r\nstratified deposits to a depth of from 3000 to 6000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"To quarry the heart of the earth\r\n    Till, in the rocks red rise,\r\n    Its age and birth, through an awful girth\r\n    Of strata, should show the wonder-worth\r\n    Of patience to all eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elevated sea-bottom is a fertile field for the fossil hunter,\r\naffording evidence that enables the geologist to reconstruct the\r\nevolutionary development of life on our planet in its divinely ordained\r\nstages. There is often but little resemblance in the fossils found in\r\nthe lower strata to the plants and animals now in existence, but traced\r\nfrom stratum to stratum, the connection is obvious. The \"fire-formed\"\r\nrocks of the Archæan Age, which support all the other strata, contain\r\nno evidence of life; neither do the first sedimentary rocks which were\r\ndeposited above them. The first fossils are found in the strata\r\noverlying the first sedimentary rock.\r\n\r\nGeologists have divided the history of the earth into seven ages:\r\n\r\n  1.  _The Archæan Age_, represented by the Archæan system of\r\n    rocks.\r\n\r\n  2.  _The Age of Invertebrates_, represented by the Cambrian,\r\n    the Lower Silurian and the Upper Silurian rocks.\r\n\r\n  3.  _The Age of Fishes_, represented by the Devonian rocks.\r\n\r\n  4.  _The Age of Amphibians_, represented by the Carboniferous\r\n    rocks.\r\n\r\n  5.  _The Age of Reptiles_, represented by the Mesozoic rocks.\r\n\r\n  6.  _The Age of Mammals_, represented by the Cenozoic rocks.\r\n\r\n  7.  _The Age of Man_, represented by recent rocks.\r\n\r\nAll of these Ages, which represent the life history of the world, left\r\ntheir impression on the rocks of their times, and each Age is connected\r\nwith the preceding and the succeeding Age like links in a long, long\r\nchain.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the distinctness and importance of the last great era, the\r\nAge of Man, Le Conte, in \"Elements of Geology,\" says that there are two\r\nviews which will ever divide geologists, depending on the two views\r\nregarding the relation of man to Nature:\r\n\r\n\"From a purely structural and animal point of view, man is very closely\r\nunited with the animal kingdom. He has no department of his own, but\r\nbelongs to the vertebrate department, along with the quadrupeds, birds,\r\nreptiles and fishes. He has no class of his own, but belongs to\r\nthe class Mammalia, along with the quadrupeds. Neither has he an order\r\nof his own, but belongs to the order of the Primates, along with the\r\nmonkeys, lemurs, etc. Even a family of his own, the Hominidae, is\r\ngrudgingly admitted by some. But from a psychical point of view it is\r\nsimply impossible to overestimate the space which separates man from all\r\nlower things. Man must be set off not only against the whole animal\r\nkingdom, but against the whole book of Nature besides, as an equivalent:\r\nNature the _Book_--the revelation--and man the _interpreter_. So in the\r\nhistory of the earth: from one point of view the era of man is not\r\nequivalent to an era, nor to an age, nor to a period, nor even to an\r\nepoch. But from another point of view it is the equivalent of the whole\r\ngeological history of the earth besides. For the history of the earth\r\n_finds its consummation, and its interpreter, and its significance, in\r\nman_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAh--how exhilarating the thought! Once again with the astronomer, we\r\ngaze out on the huge planets of the solar system,--the groups and great\r\ngalaxies of stars. Does the earth really seem so insignificant in its\r\nsmallness?\r\n\r\nThe beautiful little earth-ball, with its precious freight of human\r\nbeings, softly flies about the sun. Amply protected in a transparent\r\ncase of atmosphere, it completes its tremendous journey of 576,000,000\r\nmiles once every year. During this year its temperature is varied by\r\nfour seasons which are caused by the earth being inclined 23½ degrees\r\non its axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Some say, he bid his angels turn askance\r\n    The poles of earth twice ten degrees or more\r\n    From the sun's axle; they with labor push'd\r\n    Oblique the centric globe.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Milton's Paradise Lost._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this journey around the sun, the earth rotates 366¼ times on its\r\naxis, making one revolution every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds.\r\nThis causes each side to be alternately warmed and lighted every few\r\nhours. Cupped close to the darkened hemisphere lies a huge cone of\r\nshadow which extends out in space past the moon. When the moon\r\nrolls through this shadow it is eclipsed for it has come into our night.\r\n[Figure 157]\r\nThis cone of the earth's shadow is our personal night and ours alone,\r\nand, although the stars seem enmeshed in its velvet sides, it is not the\r\nnight of earth that holds the stars,--its darkness merely shuts out the\r\nglare of the sun and the stars of the universe therefore become visible.\r\nThis remarkable view gave to man a science set in beauty so keen that in\r\nthe world's young days it was thought that it was music too sweet to be\r\nheard by any but the gods. But now we know that all Nature is like that,\r\nand there is not a cliff, rock, shell, mountain, valley, water, land or\r\nany living thing in the botanical or zoological kingdom, no matter how\r\ncommon or how lowly, which does not carry, even as the stars, its quota\r\nof science and song.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Le Conte.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: De Greer, Bulletin of the Geological Society of America,\r\nvol. III, 1892.]\r\n\r\n[Figure 158: THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE MOON AT LAST QUARTER.\r\nPhotograph by Mount Wilson Observatory through the 100-inch\r\nHooker telescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH'S MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEAR VIEW OF A SATELLITE\r\n\r\n_Diameter--2163 miles_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE moon's diameter is equal to one-fourth that of the earth. As viewed\r\nfrom a nearby planet--neighbor Venus, the planetoids, or neighbor\r\nMars--the moon and the earth would appear as two close stars.\r\n\r\nBoth Jupiter and Saturn have moons larger than ours, but Jupiter, for\r\ninstance, is over a thousand times larger than the earth, and Saturn\r\nranks next to Jupiter. The moons of Mars are exceedingly tiny, and\r\nMercury and Venus have none at all. Neptune has one moon, Uranus four,\r\nJupiter nine and Saturn ten. Of all these moons, it is most natural for\r\nus to want complete information on the moon that lies nearest to us, the\r\nmoon of the earth, which travels around us as we journey around the sun,\r\nat a distance of only 240,000 miles. With the aid of the greatest of\r\ntelescopes, through which the accompanying photograph was taken, the\r\nmoon can be brought within a clear range of 60 miles, and even closer.\r\nHowever, an opera-glass reduces the distance to one-half, and such a\r\nglass, or a very small telescope, is much better in every way for the\r\namateur.\r\n\r\nWith the nearest planets millions of miles in the distance and the\r\nnearest stars millions of millions of miles away, the short distance of\r\n240,000 miles to the moon seems almost no distance at all; in\r\nfact, the moon lies so close to us that it not only rolls through the\r\nshadow of the earth, but we may also see the various features, and even\r\nthe shadows of those features, upon its surface.\r\n\r\nThe moon and the earth form a little system of their own and are bound\r\ntogether by a strong attraction.\r\n\r\n[Figure 159: EARTH-LIT NEW MOON.\r\nShowing a slender crescent embracing the earth-lit night portion of the\r\nmoon. Photograph through 40-inch refractor by Yerkes Observatory.]\r\n\r\nThis strong attraction, called the force of gravity, has resulted in a\r\nstrange thing happening to both the earth and the moon, for the earth\r\npulls so hard on the moon that it has long since destroyed the moon's\r\naxial rotation with reference to itself, and the moon pulls so hard on\r\nthe earth that it moves the great fluid body of the ocean. Thus the moon\r\nhas always the same face toward the earth for it cannot turn around and\r\nshow us the other side, while the pulling of the earth by the moon\r\ncauses the ocean's waters to rise and fall every 12 hours and 26\r\nminutes, or twice a day. When the Greek and Roman travelers first\r\nventured to the ocean, they could not understand why great stretches of\r\nbeaches were left dry, and with equal regularity covered up; where did\r\nthe water go, and why? It seemed a hopeless mystery to people who had\r\nlived around a landlocked sea where the tide, with few exceptions, rises\r\nbut a few inches. When the sun and moon are in line with the earth they\r\nco-operate in their pulling and hauling at the sea. The moon is then\r\neither \"new\" or \"full\" and it is then that the highest tides occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The silver Moon o'er briny seas presides,\r\n    And heaves huge ocean with alternate tides.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Lucan's Pharsalia_ (ROWE'S _Trans._)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt exactly new moon (the moon is called new when it lies between the\r\nearth and sun), the moon comes above the horizon at the same time as the\r\nsun and sets with it. A few days after new moon we sometimes see what is\r\ncalled the old moon in the young moon's arms, the dimly lighted portion\r\nbeing illuminated by light reflected from the day side of the earth.\r\nThis earthlight at the moon is at least 50 times greater than moonlight\r\nat the earth. Its somewhat ruddy color is caused by the sunlight having\r\npassed twice through our atmosphere. The bright crescent, which is the\r\nyoung moon's arms enclosing the old moon, is the sun-illuminated portion\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"I saw the new moon late yestere'en,\r\n    Wi' the auld moon in her arms.\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Old Scotch Ballad._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter \"new moon\" the moon appears a little to the east of the sun as a\r\nthin semicircle, the horns of which _always_ point to the cast. The\r\nhorns point to the east because the sun sets in the west and the\r\nilluminated part of the moon is on the side nearest to the sun, a fact\r\nsometimes forgotten by artists. The thin crescent of the moon gradually\r\nbecomes broader as the moon moves away from the sun and in the course of\r\nfour or five days increases to a semicircle.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The Moon her monthly course had now begun,\r\n    And with increasing horns forsook the Sun;\"\r\n\r\n                             --_Lucan's Pharsalia._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe semicircle then increases to an oval and by the time the moon is\r\nbehind the earth with the earth between it and the sun, the oval has\r\nincreased to a full circle. Each day the moon rises about 50 minutes\r\nlater than on the preceding day and in the course of a month changes\r\nfrom a crescent--a quarter--a full shining face, to a quarter, a\r\ncrescent and again a slender new moon. It has now traveled\r\ncompletely around the earth. Since the moon has always the same face\r\ntoward the earth (if one will walk around a table with the eyes always\r\ntoward the center, this journey will be well illustrated), it will be\r\nseen by us in all its phases before it completes a day and night, or, in\r\nother words, although the earth turns all sides to the sun in 24 hours,\r\nthe moon must travel all the way around the earth, which takes almost 30\r\nof our days, before it completes a day and night. This means a\r\ncontinuous stretch of 14¾ times 24 hours of daylight, which is about\r\nequal to 29 of our days, of daylight, followed by 14¾ times 24 hours of\r\nnight, when the sun is below the horizon. It would be a strange experience\r\nto travel to this country where the day and night each last half a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIf a journey to the weird, rough country of the moon were possible, one\r\nwould experience even greater surprises than the length of the day and\r\nthe night, for the sky, as seen from this airless sphere, would be\r\nstrangely different from anything that we are accustomed to. Here the\r\nsun hangs like a big gold jewel edged with a tiny fringe of scarlet, the\r\npearly petals of its delicate corona far outstretched against the\r\nstar-filled sky. The brilliant ball of the earth, which would appear\r\nalmost 13 times as large in area as the moon, rests immovable and ever\r\npresent, its great globe turning completely around every 24 hours. Also,\r\nas the moon does to us, it would exhibit to an observer on the moon an\r\ninteresting variety of phases, mammoth crescents, quarters and disks.\r\nSuch a sky!--a huge white planet, a flower-like sun and multitudes of\r\nunwinking stars. And even more, for stretched from horizon to horizon of\r\nthat black dome, even though the sun shines brightly, is the misty arch\r\nof the Milky Way glowing in a glory quite unknown to mortals on earth.\r\nAll this would happen for the simple reason that the moon has no\r\nappreciable amount of atmosphere to diffuse the sun's rays, make the sky\r\nseem blue and render the stars invisible. This would also unveil\r\nmany of the smaller stars that are not seen here without optical\r\naid--and every star would \"burn\" but none would \"twinkle.\" In the\r\nmorning of that long lunar day of 354 hours, the yellow face of the sun\r\nwould slowly push its gayly bedecked head above the black rim of the\r\nhorizon unheralded by a dawn; neither would twilight trail behind it\r\nwhen it sank beyond our sight after the long day was done, for these\r\nphenomena are due entirely to the light-reflecting and refracting power\r\nof an atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe absence of an atmosphere on the moon, or at least the presence of\r\nonly a very rare one, is proved by the suddenness with which a star will\r\ndisappear when the moon passes between the star and us. Also surface\r\nfeatures would not otherwise stand forth with such clearness nor shadows\r\nbe so sharp and inky-black. When the moon passes in front of the sun at\r\nthe time of an eclipse, its outline shows perfectly sharp against the\r\nyellow disk, even showing, like jagged saw-teeth, the \"mountains of\r\neternal light\" which tower near the southern pole. When Venus makes a\r\ntransit across the sun its whole edge is illuminated instead of being\r\nmerely sharply defined, for Venus is enclosed in a wrapping of\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope has proved that there is no water on the moon. If it is\r\nairless and waterless it consequently must be lifeless. But hold, a\r\nmoment. Perhaps we go too fast with our this anti that and therefore,\r\nfor here come reports from Pickering, one of our most tireless\r\nobservers, who declares that there is a considerable amount of dampness\r\nstill lodged in the deep cavities of the circular mountains, and that\r\nthis dampness ascends in mists when the sun rises. These mists do not\r\nseem to float freely but cling to ridges and higher levels and later\r\ndissolve there. The outlines of these cavities are slightly blurred\r\nuntil the mist is banished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY LAND ON THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curious gray areas which extend over two-fifths of the surface of\r\nthe moon are the most conspicuous features to be seen with the unaided\r\neye. These areas are comparatively smooth and level and invariably lower\r\nthan the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n[Figure 160: THE GRAY LAND OF THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the moon is extremely rough, the southern hemisphere in\r\nparticular presenting the most singular circumambient scenery of\r\nthousands of round pits fringed by lofty ramparts of circular mountains.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of a small telescope, the grayish spots on the moon\r\nsomewhat resemble seas as they might appear at a great distance. Thus\r\nold astronomers, believing that they might at least be ancient\r\nsea-bottoms from which the water had evaporated, named them\r\naccordingly--although rather romantically. These names are still\r\nretained, disguised in Latin on the map of the moon and referred\r\nto in Latin by present day astronomers. Translated, however, they add a\r\nquaint glamour to the Gray Land and the eye wanders interestedly over\r\n\"The Sea of Showers,\" \"The Sea of Tranquillity,\" \"The Sea of Clouds,\"\r\n\"The Sea of Nectar,\" \"The Gulf of Dews,\" \"The Ocean of Storms,\" \"The Bay\r\nof Rainbows,\" \"The Marsh of Sleep\" or \"The Lake of Dreams.\"\r\n\r\nSince the days of Galileo, improved telescopes and continued research\r\nhave constantly increased our knowledge of the moon. The curious\r\nso-called \"seas\" are not, seemingly, old sea-bottoms; they are dark\r\nplains on the lunar surface much more likely to be great lava plains\r\nthan sea-basins, according to the evidence that has been collected. Many\r\nscientists now regard these areas as a part of the surface where the\r\nthin crust became weakened and succumbed in an early stage of the moon's\r\ndevelopment; the lava then welled forth from the interior and flowed out\r\nin great molten sheets over the surrounding country. Since over 100,000\r\ncraters have also been observed on this side of the moon, all in fairly\r\ngood condition, and since there has been no weathering, it is sometimes\r\nsaid that the moon presents a picture of the volcanic age petrified.\r\n\r\nThe gray patches are best seen when the moon is full. Under a telescope\r\nthese areas appear darker with occasional traces of yellow or green\r\ntints. The colors may be due to some form of vegetation or masses of\r\ncolored volcanic material.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOON MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most prominent mountains on the moon are the Apennines. These extend\r\nin a continuous curve for 450 miles a little north of the center of the\r\nmoon, forming an impressive \"shoreline\" for Mare Imbrium, the \"Sea of\r\nShowers.\" Running northward, just above the Apennines, is the Caucasus\r\nrange, and east of the Caucasus, lie the Alps. The Alps and Caucasus\r\nmountains are far less conspicuous than the Apennines, for not\r\nonly do these latter mountains reach into a higher altitude but they\r\nalso are crowned along their 450 miles with some 3000 steep and rugged\r\npeaks.\r\n[Figure 161]\r\nThe Alps are noted for a remarkable flat-bottomed valley which cuts in a\r\nstraight line through these mountains for a distance of 80 miles. This\r\nvalley is from to 6 miles wide and at least 11,000 feet in depth. Such a\r\nlong, level strip bordered by gigantic mountains is as unique a\r\nformation as the mammoth craters with the towering rims.\r\n\r\nThe Leibnitz and the Doerfel mountains are on the southern part of the\r\nmoon near the pole. These mountains are so situated that the light of\r\nthe sun always shines from their summits, and even during an eclipse\r\nthey are visible in profile. Some of the peaks on these \"mountains of\r\neternal light\" are very high, their needle-like points reaching upward\r\nfor 26,000 to 27,000 feet. It has been estimated that if our mountains\r\non earth were comparatively as high as the mountains on the moon, our\r\nearthly mountains would rise to the height of about 15 miles! The height\r\nand sharpness of the moon mountains is due partly to the low surface\r\ngravity, which is only about ⅙th that of the earth, and to the\r\nfact that there is no leveling influence such as is caused by frosts and\r\nrains.\r\n\r\nIsolated mountains rising up like a huge lump, or a pen point, from a\r\nflat surface, are commonly found on the moon. These often stand several\r\nmiles high and are particularly interesting as seen in the northern\r\nhemisphere of the moon, when the long shadow of such a solitary mountain\r\nstretches in inky-blackness against the smooth gray plain. Several of\r\nthese may be seen in Mare Imbrium just above the crater Plato, the\r\nloftiest of which is Pico, rising about 8000 feet. Isolated mountains\r\nare very frequently found in the center of craters. This would seem a\r\nstrange formation close at hand--a large crater, or a ringed plain,\r\nmiles in extent, with a tall slender mountain standing in its center.\r\n\r\nThe oddest and most common mountains, however, are the circular\r\nmountains which surround a plain or a large sunken cavity, like a mighty\r\nwall. Such mountains appear on almost every part of the moon's surface\r\nand in some places they appear in such profusion that their rings\r\nfrequently touch and even overlap one another. The peaks of the circular\r\nmountains are often two or three miles in height and their shadows\r\nsometimes cover a large portion of the plain which they surround. These\r\nshadows are continually varying, for during the increase of the moon\r\nthey are thrown in one direction and during the decrease, in the\r\ndirection exactly opposite. During full moon they disappear altogether\r\nand the plains are filled with light, but lunar scenes are much more\r\ninteresting when the sunlighted portions are accentuated by the long,\r\nqueer shadows, for these shadows are black and clear-edged and stand out\r\nlike silhouettes done in ebony, even at this distance of 240,000 miles.\r\nBecause they have no light reflected into them from an atmosphere, these\r\nshadows are actually so densely black that if one stepped into such a\r\nshadow he would instantly be blotted from view.\r\n\r\nOn account of the vividness of the shadows, moon-mountains are best\r\nobserved during the first and last quarter of the moon. A good time to\r\nbegin observing with a glass is when the moon is a narrow crescent in\r\nthe western sky.\r\n[Figure 162]\r\nThe most prominent object in the narrow crescent is the Mare Crisium or\r\nthe Sea of Crises, 380 miles long. South of Mare Crisium is Mare\r\nFecunditatis, the Sea of Fecundity and Mare Nectaris, the Sea of Nectar.\r\nWhen these three \"Seas\" are visible with Mare Tranquillitatis just\r\ncoming into view, the moon is between 5 and 6 days old, that is, 5 or 6\r\ndays after new moon. The Leibnitz mountains may then be seen near\r\nthe southern pole. Watch carefully evening after evening as the light\r\ncreeps over new regions and brings them into view. The best place to\r\nselect for observation is the boundary line between the illuminated and\r\nunilluminated portions, called the \"terminator,\" for the shadows that\r\nare cast make the irregular features stand out more distinctly and bring\r\nout the individual beauties of the lunar scenes. Since we are looking\r\ndown upon the moon, a mountain peak, at this distance, resembles a point\r\nof light, and a mountain range whose base is still in the shadow, but\r\nwhose peaks are lighted by the rays of the sun, a straight or curved row\r\nof lights. Besides beautifying the country of the moon and revealing to\r\nus the peculiar sharpness of the mountain peaks, the shadows have proved\r\nof great practical value to astronomers, for by measuring the length of\r\ntheir shadows, the heights of the mountains are calculated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRATERS ON THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nCraters are so numerous in some localities on the moon that one might\r\nwalk for hundreds and hundreds of miles and step on nothing but crater\r\nrims. On the earth a crater is usually a rare object situated on the top\r\nof a mountain, but on the moon they are scattered all over the lunar\r\nplains, a state of landscape which permits of no short cuts. If,\r\nhowever, in the dim, distant past, life had ever developed on the moon,\r\na moon-being would have been %th as heavy and able to jump six times as\r\nhigh as an earth-being for the surface gravity of the moon is only about\r\n⅙th that of the earth. Thus if a lunarian had no other mode of\r\ntransportation, he might at least have been able to surmount many of the\r\nminor obstacles by jumping over them.\r\n\r\nA map of the moon resembles a big mud-ball with all the little pebbles\r\npicked out.\r\n\r\n[Figure 163: NORTHERN PORTION OF THE MOON.\r\nNote the \"Sea of Showers,\" the \"Bay of Rainbows,\" Copernicus and Plato,\r\nthe three craters north of the lunar \"Apennines,\" the Caucasus Range,\r\nthe Alps and the Valley of the Alps. Refer to the maps. Photograph by\r\nMount Wilson Observatory through the 100-inch Hooker telescope.]\r\n\r\nA crater only six miles in diameter may be easily seen in a small\r\ntelescope, although there are thousands less than a mile in diameter\r\nwhich may be seen in a large telescope. Craters from 16 miles to 60\r\nmiles in diameter are common and a few even measure as much as 100 to\r\n150 miles. These craters have deeply sunken floors and are usually\r\nsurrounded by gigantic mountain walls which rise like a fringe of rock\r\nabove the general level of the region outside. Near the center of many\r\nof the craters with the largest brims, one and sometimes two or three\r\nsharp-peaked mountains tower, casting a long, weird shadow over the\r\ncrater's floor. The surrounding brim is almost invariably higher than\r\nthe central mountain, yet many of these central mountains are a mile or\r\nso high.\r\n\r\nProbably the deepest of the moon's craters is _Theophilus_, on the edge\r\nof the circular \"sea\" Mare Nectaris, and it is best seen while the moon\r\nis still a slender crescent. The encircling walls of this crater rise\r\nfrom 14,000 to 18,000 feet above its floor, the floor itself being\r\n10,000 feet below the general level of the moon outside the wall. The\r\nwalls of this amazing cavity, in the main, slope gently to the outer\r\nplain but rise very steeply from the depths of the inner floor which\r\nmeasures 64 miles across. Three lofty cone-shaped mountains rest in the\r\ncenter of this floor, their sharp, black shadows stretching to the left.\r\nOne of these mountains rises 6000 feet, yet its summit is some 4000 feet\r\nlower than the level of the outside plain! Imagine standing on the rim\r\nof Theophilus and watching the darkness flow into its huge bowl until\r\nthe mountain peaks in the center look like sunny isles in a dense, black\r\nsea! This is a _real_ crater, for the word \"crater\" means \"cup.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the large craters on the moon, however, are not so \"cup-like,\"\r\nbut, to pursue the simile still farther, are more like platters and\r\nsaucers and individual butter plates, for their diameters range from\r\nfive times to more than fifty times their depth.\r\n\r\n[Figure 164: THE LUNAR CRATER COPERNICUS, FIFTY MILES IN DIAMETER.\r\nPhotograph by Mount Wilson Observatory through the 100-inch\r\nHooker telescope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nChacornac mentions a walled-plain called _Schickard_, on the southeast\r\nportion of the moon, which is 134 miles in breadth, and, although\r\nencircled by a mountain wall which in one place is nearly 10,000 feet\r\nhigh, a spectator centrally located on the floor of the crater would\r\nthink himself on a boundless desert, for this encircling wall, due to\r\nthe curvature of the surface of the moon, would lie entirely beneath his\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nOne of the most magnificent craters on the moon is the great crater\r\n_Copernicus_. Copernicus lies in an isolated position a little southeast\r\nof the range of the Apennines, on the darkened space called Mare\r\nImbrium. Being not far from the center of the lunar disk, it is an easy\r\nobject for the eye to find and to use as a guiding point from which to\r\nlocate other craters. A circular range of mountains much terraced on the\r\ninner side surrounds the great plain of Copernicus, while in the very\r\ncenter of its 56 miles of floor stands a solitary mountain with an\r\naltitude of 11,000 feet. It is believed by many astronomers that such\r\nterracing as is shown in the interior of Copernicus, is mainly due \"to\r\nthe repeated alternate rise, partial congelation, and subsequent\r\nretreat\" of a great flow of lava which rose up from the floor during a\r\nperiod long past. A number of other craters also show such terracing.\r\nThe bright appearance of Copernicus is caused by an interesting system\r\nof bright streaks which radiate from the circular rim of its mountains.\r\nTycho, near the southern pole, has also such a system of radiating\r\nstreaks, but so enlarged and intensified are the rays of Tycho's system\r\nthat they run for hundreds of miles and dominate the whole scene when\r\nthe moon is full.\r\n\r\n_Aristarchus_, northeast of Copernicus, is the brightest single point on\r\nthe moon. The peak in the center of its 29 miles of brilliant interior\r\nshines so brightly that it has often been seen on the dark side after\r\nnew moon. Indeed, when Sir William Herschel first observed it through a\r\ntelescope he mistook it for a volcano in action. The walls of\r\nAristarchus are also conspicuously terraced and rise about 4000 feet\r\nabove its floor.\r\n\r\n[Figure 165]\r\nSouth of Aristarchus and east of Copernicus may be seen _Kepler_, a\r\n22-mile crater noted for its extended system of glistening streaks. Its\r\nsurrounding wall, like that of Tycho and Copernicus, seems to be covered\r\nwith the same shining substance. The wall of Kepler is very low but its\r\ncrater is about 10,000 feet below the exterior plain.\r\n\r\nSoutheast of the two bright craters, Kepler and Copernicus, and almost\r\nat the edge of the moon, lies the darkest and also one of the largest of\r\nthe moon's craters, or walled-plains, as the large craters are now more\r\nfrequently called. This huge crater, _Grimaldi_, extends north and south\r\nfor a distance of 148 miles and covers an area of 14,000 square miles.\r\nIt is very noticeably dark in comparison to all surrounding objects.\r\n\r\n_Gassendi_, a little southwest of Grimaldi, contains a great variety of\r\ndetail both on its rim and on its floor. Its plain is 54 miles in\r\ndiameter and includes a number of central peaks.\r\n\r\nAgain starting from Copernicus and letting the eye travel northwest\r\nalong the Apennine mountains almost to the Caucasus, one arrives at a\r\ngroup of three beautiful craters which rest conspicuously on the level\r\nfloor of Mare Imbrium. The largest of these craters is named\r\n_Archimedes_ after the most celebrated of ancient mathematicians. It is\r\nto be noted that lunar craters have been given the names of great\r\nmen--Copernicus, Tycho, Kepler, great astronomers; Aristotle, Plato,\r\ngreat philosophers,--a very fine recognition of scholarly worth.\r\nArchimedes, 52 miles in diameter, has no interior mountain, but the\r\nshadows of its tall rim are imposing as they fall across its plain.\r\n\r\n[Figure 166: Some Interesting Craters on the Moon.]\r\n\r\n_Aristillus_ is about 34 miles in diameter, and 10,000 feet deep. In the\r\ncenter of this deep cavity rises a massive many-peaked mountain whose\r\nbase is often lost in the darkness of the crater's shadows. _Autolycus_,\r\nsouth of Aristillus and somewhat smaller, is 23 miles in diameter with a\r\nfloor somewhat depressed below the country which surrounds it.\r\n\r\n[Figure 167: Some interesting Craters on the Moon.]\r\n\r\nOn the \"shore-line\" of Mare Imbrium, north of Archimedes, Aristillus and\r\nAutolycus, and not far from the \"Valley of the Alps,\" lies _Plato_, one\r\nof the most easily found craters on the moon. Plato is a very huge\r\noblong crater, 60 miles in diameter and containing an area of 2,700\r\nmiles. Its floor is exceptionally dark and flat and forms a\r\nstriking contrast with the bright border of mountains which surround it.\r\nQuite a number of minute craterlets have been distinguished on its\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe southern hemisphere of the moon, particularly as one approaches the\r\nregion about the southern pole, is pitted with such a bewildering number\r\nof both large and small craters that astronomers say that it is relief\r\nto the eye to study the comparatively smooth, shaded portions of the\r\nglobe after having gazed for any length of time at the crowded mass of\r\ndetail in this wild and rugged region. The two craters in the southern\r\nhemisphere that are perhaps the easiest for the amateur to locate are\r\n_Clavius_, an enormous crater near the mountains at the southern pole,\r\nand _Tycho_, just below it, with its wonderful streaks, or rays.\r\n\r\n_Clavius_ is a crater of gorgeous depth and has an area of 16,500 miles.\r\nAround its walls and on its floor are many secondary craters, while from\r\nits center rise tall mountain peaks, one of which reaches 24,000 feet\r\nabove the bottom of one of its included craters.\r\n\r\n_Tycho_ is called \"The Metropolitan Crater of the Moon,\" because its\r\nbrilliant rays stand forth so prominently when the moon is full that all\r\nother craters are lost in obscurity. This magnificent crater measures 54\r\nmiles from rim to rim with its floor over 3 miles below the highest\r\nridge of the massive mountains which surround it. These mountains are\r\ndiversified by a series of terraces on their interior slopes while a\r\npeak 6000 feet in height rises in the center of its floor. The ray\r\nsystem of Tycho is wholly invisible at the time the sun rises or sets,\r\nwhich is the time when most of the objects on the moon are seen at their\r\nbest. However when the sun has attained an altitude of 30 degrees, they\r\nmysteriously make their appearance, extending for hundreds and some even\r\nfor several thousands of miles. These rays are never irregular because\r\nof interposed obstructions but stretch straight and true in a most\r\nremarkable way over mountains, pits and plains. So numerous are these\r\nbright rays about the brilliant crater of Tycho that at full moon they\r\nmay even be located as a patch of light to the unaided eye, although an\r\nopera-glass, which brings the moon down to 120,000 miles instead of\r\n240,000, greatly improves the seeing. William H. Pickering, in his book\r\non \"Mars,\" gives some of the latest information concerning Tycho:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The white radiating lines or bands are seen to be due to numerous\r\nminute craterlets each giving out a triangular white streamer producing\r\nthe general effect of a white band. It is probable that this observed\r\nregular distribution of the craterlets is due to their lying along\r\ninvisible cracks radiating from the inner crater. It is much the same as\r\nthe great volcanoes of the Andes, which stretch in a straight line for\r\nover 2000 miles between Peru and the strait of Magellan. The Alaskan\r\nvolcanoes lie upon a uniformly curved line of nearly equal length....\r\nThis line formation is generally considered by geologists to be due to\r\nsubterranean lines of weakness or cracks in the earth's crust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon is considered to be a matured globe, evolutionally old, and it\r\nhas even been referred to as being nearly dead. Lacking, air, water,\r\nlife and even the diversion of sound, it surely is at least in but a\r\nsemi-conscious stage, as worlds go. Mars is also called an old world,\r\nbut Mars has air, its snow-caps melt in sheets of water, and we view the\r\ncolors which mark its seasons, across a distance of 50,000,000 miles.\r\nThe moon looks as it is, seared and old. There have been many theories\r\nadvanced to explain the abundance of its craters and their peculiar\r\nconstruction, but some modified form of the volcanic action is the only\r\ntenable one. No one theory has as yet met with universal approval.\r\n\r\nA great telescope with a 100-inch lens has lately been erected at Mount\r\nWilson, near Pasadena, California. The telescopes which have mirrors,\r\nlike this one, are called reflecting telescopes. The largest reflecting\r\ntelescope before the one now mounted on Mount Wilson became available,\r\nwas the splendid instrument at Little Saanich, Victoria, B.C.,\r\nwhich has a 72-inch mirror. A telescope in which the light rays pass\r\nthrough a series of lenses fixed in a long tube pointed directly at the\r\nobject is called a refracting telescope. The Yerkes telescope at the\r\nUniversity of Chicago is an unusually fine 40-inch refractor.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest of telescopes the moon may be brought to within 60\r\nmiles of the earth and a lunar object a mile or so in diameter is easily\r\ndiscernible. The imagination is entranced.
