But poets and painters live\r\nin a realm uncongenial to the startling facts of modern chemistry.\r\nVirgil would undoubtedly have been as ready to have believed that H₂O\r\nrepresented a glass of milk, as that it was the equivalent of pure water;\r\nwhile, if Raphael had been told that the pool of Bethesda was abundant\r\nwith “albuminoid ammonia,” he might innocently have believed it to be\r\n“something good to eat.”\r\n\r\nTradition and popular education have taken wings in a tangent direction\r\nfrom many of the fundamental principles of a natural existence, and,\r\nwhile freighting the popular mind with its bulky chaff, sparsely grained,\r\nthey seldom recognize the revelations of science. The plot of some\r\nwell drawn novel, or the fascinating performances of its hero, rest\r\nunforgotten in the embrace of memory,—are sought after, cherished, and\r\nremembered in all and by all ages. Science as yet is but little courted,\r\nmuch less wedded to the popular taste, and the stubbornness of facts\r\nis in direct ratio to the inflexibility of the public mind. Science,\r\nhowever, is not always of one hue. It is full of attractions and alluring\r\nfascinations. It needs only to be clothed in well cut and fashionable\r\ngarments, and properly and politely introduced, to receive universal\r\nrecognition and popular applause. This is especially true of the science\r\nof sanitation, because it is more closely allied to the vital interests\r\nof every community and every family than all others, and, through the\r\nsimplicity of its primary principles, can be realized and understood by\r\nall.\r\n\r\nPure water is essential to the health and comfort of every community:\r\nthere is no argument to the contrary. How such a _desideratum_ can\r\nbe acquired and maintained is a problem which requires the closest\r\napplication of science, as well as mechanical and engineering skill. The\r\nquestion, whenever and wherever applied, becomes an isolated reality,\r\nand the solution, instead of being based upon established formulas\r\nor analogy, is almost wholly dependent upon the individual facts and\r\nconditions connected therewith.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the question a century hence will be very different from\r\nwhat it is to-day, even as in its present bearings it differs from\r\nthe time when the woodman’s axe was the only sound of industry that\r\nechoed through the sleeping valleys and over the watchful hills of New\r\nHampshire. In that day the hardy pioneer quenched his thirst by the\r\nside of any stream or spring with water as pure as earth could give.\r\nHe thought not to glance up the stream to see if it was spanned by a\r\nfamily vault, or flanked by a barn-yard. Likewise, if he partook from\r\nthe bubbling spring or the primitive well, he never imagined a crystal\r\nof urea came up in the tiny fountains of sand at its bottom, or that the\r\nsparkle of the water was the carbonic acid of a sink drain; for around\r\nhim were no such dangers. But civilization (in many respects a misnomer)\r\ncame on, and brought with her more evils than one,—seduced the virginity\r\nof nature, and begot a host of illegitimate products and conditions.\r\nInto her very veins—the streams and rivers—have been injected the effete\r\nproducts of waste and decay; and to-day her very gifts, poisoned by men,\r\nbring pain, poverty, tears, and death into many households.\r\n\r\nWe have all, no doubt, traced some cases of the zymotic order to\r\npolluted water, with evidence that left no doubt as to the correctness of\r\nour conclusions. As to how far such influences extend in the causation of\r\ndisease is undetermined, but I believe it extends far beyond the category\r\nof acute zymotic diseases.\r\n\r\nWhat of the great invalid corp that register their physical afflictions\r\nunder the comprehensive term “poor health,” and who seem to have no\r\nspecific disease, either acute or chronic? What demon has laid so\r\noppressive a burden upon the nerve centres that half of life’s function\r\nis smothered, and the physical energies nearly blotted out? I believe\r\nthat contaminated water is one of the prime factors in this unfortunate\r\nand distressing aggregate. We have often traced typhoid fever, dysentery,\r\nand other diseases to a polluted well or spring; but the cause of\r\ninsidious decay, progressive pallor, softening muscles, wasting strength,\r\nand slow enervation is not so readily found nor so zealously sought\r\nafter. That contaminated water should produce such results, associated\r\nperhaps with other unsanitary surroundings, there can be no argument to\r\ndisprove. A close study of the subject for the past two years has led me\r\nto believe that polluted wells are a most prolific source of sickness and\r\ndeath throughout the state. I believe the medical profession is not yet\r\nso thoroughly aroused upon this subject as the facts demand, and that if\r\nthe physicians of the state should carefully investigate the question\r\nof water pollution, the result would be one of wide-spread alarm at the\r\nravages it is producing.\r\n\r\nBy far the most dangerous source of water supply is the well, because\r\nof its close proximity to dwellings. If the surroundings of a well are\r\nnot free from all impurities and waste, we have no right to expect pure\r\nwater, and an attack of typhoid fever, dysentery, or kindred diseases\r\nshould not in the least astonish us. _Conditions which endanger our wells\r\nare the rule and not the exception, both in the sparsely settled country\r\nand in the city._\r\n\r\nIn a speech before the Central N. Y. Medical Association in 1875, Dr.\r\nHarvey Jewett said,—\r\n\r\n“We are often asked, In what way does the water of our wells, in farming\r\ncommunities especially, and in our larger villages, become impure?\r\nIt comes bubbling up from the deep fountains, fresh, cold, pure, and\r\nclear as the crystal, and often gives no indication by taste or smell\r\nof containing impurities. How often do we see the waste water from\r\nour kitchens thrown out upon the ground year after year, until the\r\nsoil is saturated thereby? Then, again, the continuity of sink-drains,\r\ncess-pools, and privy vaults to our wells is sufficient to saturate the\r\nearth with their poisonous, disease-producing elements. It is through\r\nthe agency of this apparently _pure water_, constantly, insidiously\r\nintroducing these subtle elements into the human organism, that the\r\nfountains of life are poisoned and disease generated. In large towns and\r\nthickly populated streets, with slovenly domestics, the whole surface\r\nbecomes saturated with the waste water, and in wet seasons the well,\r\nbeing the only artificial drainage, receives the drippings, converting\r\nit into a cess-pool of filth. I have known instances where the waste\r\nwater from the sink-drain ran directly into the well, until the horrible\r\nstench compelled an investigation and a remedy. Instances of this kind\r\nare by no means rare, where a direct communication from the sink to the\r\nwell is found to exist. With some families in the country the whole waste\r\nwater of the household is thrown out upon the ground, until the entire\r\nsurface soil is saturated like a sponge with the elements of disease. The\r\npopular but erroneous idea, that filling in earth upon a water-saturated\r\nsoil removes the necessity of deep drainage, should be exploded from\r\nthe minds of the people, and the great central fact set forth, that\r\nno water-saturated soil is fit for human habitation, and that a large\r\nproportion of unhealthfulness and human ailments can be traced directly\r\nor indirectly to this influence.”\r\n\r\nI have had forwarded to me during the past year many samples of well\r\nwater from different sections of the state for examination, and _over\r\nninety-five per cent. were contaminated_. In many instances no particular\r\nsuspicion existed that the wells were polluted, so “sweet and sparkling”\r\nwas the water. With the exception of a few wells in this city, the\r\nsamples came from the smaller villages and isolated farm-houses. I\r\nsuspect, and my experience is in accord with the idea, that the most\r\ndangerous wells are to be found at the latter, because such a well is\r\nsubjected not only to the unsanitary influences of the household, but\r\nof the barns, cattle-yards, hennery, pig-sty, etc. No one can reasonably\r\npresume that a well situated in close proximity to such surroundings\r\ncan long remain pure, except that its altitude is such as to render\r\ncontamination impossible, which is rarely the case. It should be borne\r\nin mind that a well is in itself a system of drainage for a given area\r\nof the earth, which area is dependent upon the depth of the well and the\r\ncharacter of the soil. The accepted formula is, that it drains a portion\r\nof soil represented by an inverted cone, the base of which equals in\r\ndiameter the depth of the well. Thus, the well _must_ drain a certain\r\namount of soil or earth, and unless this certain amount is kept clean\r\nand uncontaminated, the well _must become polluted_. It should not be\r\nforgotten that this described cone of soil is the _minimum_ amount that\r\na well can drain, while with favorable conditions the maximum area is\r\nalmost unlimited. A stratum of clay or other impervious substance, or\r\nfissures in the rock formation, may act as the carrier of a little stream\r\nor vein of polluted water till it reaches the well, and the source of\r\npollution may be a long distance away.\r\n\r\nThe sketch which is here reproduced from the last report of the State\r\nBoard of Health vividly illustrates the way in which a well is often\r\npolluted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe double lines 1 and 2 represent the angle which the well drains. The\r\nslightly curved lines 3 and 4 represent the water line in the ground,\r\nthe constant use of the well depressing this line below a level in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the well. The lines radiating from the cess-pool\r\nand vault illustrate the cause of said pollution, and consequently\r\ncontamination of the water in the well. This sketch is in no way\r\noverdrawn: I have seen many wells apparently situated in precisely the\r\nsame way. If somewhere in a near and convenient location to this well, as\r\nshown above, were placed a barn-yard and a pig-sty in addition to what we\r\nnow see, it would represent the exact condition of many of our farmers’\r\nwells. Yet the proprietor of this “best well in town” wonders why his\r\ndoctor’s bills are so large! He bows “to the will of God” when cholera\r\ninfantum takes the life of his little child, when his own ignorance or\r\ncupidity is the destroyer. How long shall the Almighty be charged with\r\ncrimes that come alone from the ignorance, carelessness, neglect, and\r\nconceit of men?\r\n\r\nI propose to give a few illustrations of water pollution that are of a\r\nvery marked character. The following diagram is that of a hotel in one\r\nof the thriving towns in this state, and the facts connected therewith I\r\nobtained from a reliable physician under the promise of not giving to\r\nthe public the locality or his name. I have seen the hotel myself, and\r\nassure you that the location was as represented.\r\n\r\nA case of typhoid fever occurred the past season (1882) in the bed-room\r\nnear the privy (see diagram No. 1). All the discharges from this patient\r\nwere thrown into the vault without being disinfected. This vault was\r\nlocated about _fifteen feet from the well_ which supplied this house.\r\nResult: _Fourteen cases of typhoid fever, with one death, from the use of\r\nthis water for drinking purposes_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM NO. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe following description and history of a well in Newport (although I\r\npublished the same in the last report of the State Board of Health) is of\r\nsuch a remarkable character that it will bear republication.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Dr. D. M. Currier was directed to this well in the\r\ninvestigation of the cause of sickness in the family that used this\r\nwater, and the analysis which is given of the water was made by Prof.\r\nEdmund R. Angell of Derry.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF THE NEWPORT WELL.\r\n\r\n    Odor,                                                      slight.\r\n    Color,                                         a little yellowish.\r\n    Total solids, grains per gallon,                             49.2\r\n    Soluble solids,                                              34.7\r\n    Ignition of residue,                                  it blackens.\r\n    Combustible and volatile matter, grains per gal.,            9.24\r\n    Hardness, equivalent to grains of CaCo₃ per gal.,           11.00\r\n    Alkalinity,       ”       ”       ”       ”                 15.00\r\n    Chlorine, grains per gallon,                                12.00\r\n    Ammonia, parts per million,—\r\n             Free ammonia,                                     0.0666\r\n             Albuminoid ammonia,                               0.3100\r\n    Nitric acid, grains per gallon,                              2.69\r\n    Nitrous acid,                                                none.\r\n    Iodine,                                                      none.\r\n    Bromine,                                                     none.\r\n    Iron,                                           very slight trace.\r\n    Copper and lead,                                             none.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic examination of sediment shows,—\r\n\r\n    Bacteria:\r\n      Bacteria Bacillus.\r\n      Bacteria Vibrio.\r\n    Infusoria:\r\n      Flagellata Monadina.\r\n      Flagellata Euglenia.\r\n      Ciliata Enchelia.\r\n      Ciliata Bursarina.\r\n      Ciliata Parmecia.\r\n    Silicious granules.\r\n    Small pieces of decaying wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL FACTS.\r\n\r\n    Free carbonic acid, grains per gallon, 11.9504\r\n    Combined Co₂,         ”     ”     ”     6.6528\r\n    Total Co₂,            ”     ”     ”    18.6032\r\n\r\nBases: Lime, magnesia, soda, potassa, ammonia.\r\n\r\nAcids: Hydrochloric, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, carbonic, silicic.\r\n\r\nMost of the lime is in the form of carbonate held in solution by carbonic\r\nacid; most of the magnesia exists as a salt soluble in water, probably\r\nthe sulphate; some of the alkalies are present as carbonates. The iron is\r\nkept in solution by carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION AND OPINION.\r\n\r\nThe color and odor indicate contamination. The large amount of soluble\r\nsolids is suspicious. The blackening of the residue during ignition\r\nshows the presence of organic matter in solution. The large amount of\r\ncombustible and volatile matter is a grave indication. Because the\r\nalkalinity exceeds the hardness, it shows the presence of an alkaline\r\ncarbonate, which is a suspicious circumstance, since it may result from\r\nthe decomposition of animal matter. The amount of chlorine is unusually\r\nlarge. I think the average for well water is about one grain. The large\r\nquantity of chlorine and the presence of alkaline carbonates point very\r\nstrongly to the stable, privy, sewer, or cess-pool. The amount of nitric\r\nacid is large, though this alone may not mean much, yet joined with the\r\nother results it has much significance. The amount of ammonia is more\r\nthan twice the quantity that ought to condemn a water absolutely. The\r\nsmall amount of free ammonia and the large quantity of albuminoid ammonia\r\nshow that a large amount of organic matter is present and decaying\r\nslowly. As the weather becomes warm, the proportion of free ammonia will\r\nincrease. Bacteria are always associated with putrefaction and conditions\r\nof hygienic importance.\r\n\r\nInfusoria are never generated except in organic solutions. They are\r\nabundant in all fresh water wherever organic matter is held in solution,\r\nalso in stagnant water.\r\n\r\nFrom the large amount of chlorine and the presence of alkaline\r\ncarbonates, it would appear that the water is contaminated with animal\r\nrather than with vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nThis water is unfit for domestic uses.\r\n\r\n                                                        EDMUND R. ANGELL.\r\n\r\nA word in explanation may be necessary to those who are not familiar with\r\nwater analysis.\r\n\r\nWater that contains such a large amount of solids is very suspicious. It\r\nwill be seen that the sample contained twelve grains of chlorine to the\r\ngallon, which would alone at once condemn it. The only source from which\r\nchlorine is derived in the waters of this state, except possibly a trace,\r\nmust be from the sewage or waste from the household, where common salt is\r\nused. A well that contains over one grain to the gallon is to be looked\r\nupon with suspicion. The same is true of a water that contains over 0.01\r\npart of ammonia or “albuminoid ammonia.”\r\n\r\nThen, again, the bacteria and infusoria, to the extent present, indicate\r\nits pollution.\r\n\r\nOf the history of this well and the family using its water Dr. Currier\r\nrenders the following report, which is a terrible commentary upon the\r\ndangers of filth in drinking-water. Since the report was made, Dr. C.\r\nstates that there was a case of typhoid upon these premises during the\r\nearly part of the winter, which he did not know of at the time his\r\nreport was written.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. CURRIER’S REPORT.\r\n\r\nThe farm-house, from the well of which was taken the specimen of polluted\r\nwater, is situated on a high bluff of land south-east of the village,\r\nand is known by the name of East Mountain. Upon this ridge of land are\r\nsituated some of the best farms in town. The soil is rich and deep,\r\nunderlying which is a sub-soil of clay, very hard and compact, but\r\noccasionally interrupted by a deposit of sand. I have been told there\r\nwere beds of sand in the vicinity of this dwelling-house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM NO. 2.]\r\n\r\nBy the diagram sent, you will see that the well is under the L part\r\nof the house. The water is drawn up by means of a windlass in one of\r\nthe back rooms. The well itself is some twenty-five feet deep. In the\r\nsummer kitchen, not more than three or four feet from the well, you will\r\nnotice the sink marked 2 on the diagram, which discharges its water on\r\nthe ground by means of an open spout but a few feet from the outside of\r\nthe building. At 3, about an equal distance from the well, is a back\r\ndoor, from which foul water, as on washing-days, and filth of nearly all\r\ndescriptions, were usually thrown, which is not saying more than can be\r\nsaid of back doors to farm-houses in general.\r\n\r\nAs you step out of this door, a little to your left you will see the\r\npig-sty, the centre of which cannot be more than fifteen feet from top\r\nof well. The privy marked 4 is entered from the walk leading from the\r\nwell-room to the barn-yard, the excrements of which are received upon the\r\nground. The distance from the door, 7, that opens into the barn-yard,\r\nand the well, is just twenty-four feet by actual measurement. Stepping\r\nout of this door you are in the barn-yard filled with cattle and sheep,\r\non the further side of which is the barn with its usual manure heap\r\nand decomposing vegetable matter in general. Thus we have the barn,\r\nbarn-yard, privy, pig-sty, back door, and sink all in dangerous proximity\r\nto the well, either one of which might contaminate its water, and render\r\nit unfit for use.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 8th of March, 1883, that I procured the second specimen\r\nof water from this well that I sent you. For over three months prior\r\nto that date the ground had been frozen and covered with snow, with no\r\nthaws during the whole winter severe enough to cause any surface-water.\r\nThe winter was what is called a dry one, all the wells in that vicinity\r\nbeing remarkably low, so that there could be no surface-water finding its\r\nway into the well on that date, and probably had not for months previous:\r\nthe influence of the surroundings at that time must have been at the\r\nminimum. If the water is bad under this condition, what must it be soon\r\nafter the frost is out, and the well becomes filled with its maximum of\r\nsurface-water?\r\n\r\nNow the interesting question comes, What has been the effect upon the\r\nhealth and lives of the family or families occupying this house and using\r\nthis water? I am informed that they did not use the water at all times,\r\nunder suspicion that it might not be good: still it was used more or less.\r\n\r\nForty-one years ago the place was purchased and occupied by a man then in\r\nthe prime of life. He had seven children, some of whom were born before\r\nand some after moving upon the place. The father, mother, and all the\r\nchildren are now dead, except one.\r\n\r\nThe date, age, and cause of death, as near as I can find out, are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1849, a son, age 18 years; cause, typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n    1849, a daughter, age 16 years; cause, typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n    1863, a son, age 28 years; cause, consumption.\r\n\r\n    1871, mother, age 63 years; cause, gall stones; great sufferer\r\n    from sick headache.\r\n\r\n    1874, a daughter, age 27 years; cause, consumption.\r\n\r\n    1878, a son, age 37 years; cause, consumption.\r\n\r\n    1879, a daughter, age 34 years; cause, consumption.\r\n\r\n    1879, father, age 76 years; cause, old age, feeble a long time.\r\n\r\n    1883, a son-in-law, age 47 years; cause, bronchial consumption.\r\n\r\nThis last was the only one of whom I had charge, and it was during one\r\nof my professional visits that I discovered the situation of the well.\r\nOne of the first things of which he complained was sore throat and\r\nhoarseness, laryngo-pharyngitis. At the same time he was troubled with\r\nan eruption. I never saw it, but as he described it I should say that it\r\nwas erythematous in its nature. If he exercised so as to perspire, or\r\ntook hot drinks, it would make its appearance, causing the surface to\r\nitch and feel very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer of 1882 he was under the care of various\r\nphysicians, both regular and irregular, until the first of October of\r\nthat year, when he came under my care, at which time he was troubled\r\nwith cough and hoarseness, it being with difficulty that he spoke aloud.\r\nThe stomach was very irritable, frequently rejecting food, and more\r\noften his medicine. Once when he was in my office for the purpose of\r\nconsultation, I inquired in regard to his drinking-water. He told me that\r\nit was “splendid water,” and all right; that he drank a great deal of\r\nit. At various times during the fall and early winter he would seem to\r\nimprove, when some imprudence on his part would put him back. Finally he\r\ngrew worse, as manifested by failing strength, loss of appetite, and by\r\ncoughing and raising more, until his death.\r\n\r\nThe sputa was very tenacious, and at last was quite thick, and composed\r\nalmost entirely of pus. A few weeks before he died I examined his chest\r\nthoroughly. There was no dulness over either lung, and he could fill both\r\nof them equally well. Auscultation revealed very heavy, moist rales.\r\n\r\nAbout five weeks before the death of the father,—that was some time in\r\nJanuary,—I was called to the house to attend his son, a lad six years\r\nof age, with dysentery accompanied with petechial eruption over the\r\nlimbs and body. He recovered slowly. In about two weeks two other sons,\r\naged respectively eight and ten years, came down in the same way with\r\ndysentery and the eruption, causing them to scratch vigorously. The\r\nmother was troubled with the eruption, but no dysentery.\r\n\r\n                                                           D. M. CURRIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RYE BEACH WELL,\r\n\r\nwhich has attracted considerable attention the present season, and been\r\nthe source of many false newspaper reports, is most remarkable in the\r\nhistory of water pollution. Briefly, the history connected therewith is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nA wealthy Philadelphian by the name of Lewis, who has spent his summers\r\nat this noted beach for the last twelve years, bought last spring a lot\r\nof land, and built a very expensive and elegant summer residence. The\r\nlocation was upon an elevation some forty or fifty feet higher than the\r\nsea, and but a short distance from the water. This elevation is made up\r\nmostly of seamy ledges, with but a few feet of soil covering the same.\r\nFrom a sanitary point of view, no better site could possibly be selected.\r\n\r\nInstead of building a sewer to the ocean for drainage purposes, he\r\nconstructed a cess-pool forty feet distant from the house, into which\r\nall the sewage from the house ran. In building this cess-pool it\r\nwas necessary to excavate three feet of the ledge to get a good and\r\nsufficient depth. Sixty feet from this cess-pool, and apparently upon\r\nthe same level, was dug the well which was to supply this residence with\r\nwater. After reaching the ledge, it was necessary to go ten feet into\r\nthe rock to get sufficient water, which was obtained in abundance, and\r\nwas excellent in quality. The well and cess-pool were both constructed\r\nat the same time, and in _two weeks after, the well was polluted by\r\nthis cess-pool_. The family, not realizing the source of pollution or\r\nits danger, continued to use the water for a short time afterwards, or\r\nuntil it became so tainted that it was repulsive to the senses of taste\r\nand smell. The result was the death of Mr. Lewis, and a lady visitor who\r\nlived in the vicinity and frequently drank of this water, and a severe\r\nillness of a daughter of Mr. Lewis, his servant, and a guest of the\r\nfamily. These seemed to be cases of blood poisoning, the severer ones\r\nresembling in their last stage typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThis instance of well pollution illustrates the fact that a rock\r\nformation, though generally believed to be the best safeguard against\r\nthe contamination of a well, may be the most dangerous. The seams which\r\nexisted in this ledge no doubt served as direct channels to convey the\r\nfilth to this well.\r\n\r\nThe following instance of well pollution seems to illustrate in what\r\nunsuspected ways water may become contaminated:\r\n\r\nA short time since, Dr. C. A. Wood, of Greenville, sent me several\r\nspecimens of water for examination. The contamination of some of them was\r\nof such a character that I asked him for a history of the samples. I\r\nwill here state that the specimens marked “No. 2” and “No. 3” were both\r\nbadly polluted, and with different substances, so that, in testing, the\r\nchemical reactions were quite different. In his reply to my letter of\r\ninquiry he says,—\r\n\r\n“The water I sent you last week marked No. 2 was dipped directly from the\r\nwell, as shown in diagram, while the water marked No. 3 was pumped from\r\nthe pump. The family have been sick more or less ever since they occupied\r\nthe house. _None of them have been well_, but it is exceedingly difficult\r\nto give a name to their complaints, except a general out of fix, with a\r\ndull, tired feeling, headaches, sore throats, furred tongues, &c., but no\r\ndownright sickness so as to prostrate them.”\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen by the crude diagram that the cess-pool filth\r\nwhich had accumulated around the lead pipe leading to the well, by reason\r\nof a breakage in the sink-drain, had corroded the water-pipe till it was\r\nfull of small holes, which allowed this filth to be drawn in and mixed\r\nwith the water every time any was drawn from the well. Such a condition\r\nis not likely to be of very frequent occurrence, but it demonstrates\r\nthe fact that the source of water pollution may be sometimes subtle and\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM NO. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing paper it has been my aim only to present some points\r\nthat will lead to a more careful consideration of this all-important\r\nsubject, rather than to discuss the topic from a purely scientific\r\nstandpoint. To awaken a deeper interest in the prevention of disease is\r\nnecessary both in the profession and among the people, and I sincerely\r\nhope the medical men of our state will become the instructors and the\r\nguardians of the public to the extent that unnecessary sickness may be\r\nlargely averted, and nature’s gifts received in nature’s purity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Water pollution--Wells, by Irving A.
