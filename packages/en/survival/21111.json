During\r\ntwenty years of variable health, the companionship of the animal world\r\nhas been my constant solace and delight. To keep my own memory fresh, in\r\nthe first instance, and afterwards with a distinct intention of\r\nrepeating my single experiences to others, I have kept notes of whatever\r\nhas seemed to me worthy of record in the life of my pets. Some of these\r\npapers have already appeared in _The Animal World_; the majority are\r\nnow printed for the first time.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters I shall try to have quiet talks with my\r\nreaders and tell them in a simple way about the many pleasant\r\nfriendships I have had with animals, birds, and insects. I use the word\r\nfriendships advisedly, because truly to know and enjoy the society of a\r\npet creature you must make it feel that you are, or wish to be, its\r\nfriend, one to whom it can always look for food, shelter, and solace; it\r\nmust be at ease and at home with you before its instincts and curious\r\nways will be shown. Sometimes when friends have wished me to see their\r\nso-called \"pet,\" some scared animal or poor fluttering bird has been\r\nbrought, for whom my deepest sympathy has been excited; and yet there\r\nmay have been perhaps the kindest desire to make the creature happy,\r\nfood provided in abundance, and a pleasant home; but these alone will\r\nnot avail. For lack of the quiet gentle treatment which is so requisite,\r\nthe poor little captive will possibly be miserable, pining for liberty,\r\nhating its prison, dreading the visits of its jailor, and so harassed in\r\nits terror that in some cases the poor little heart is broken, and in a\r\nfew hours death is the result. In the following simple sketches of\r\nanimal, bird, and insect life, I have tried to show how confidence must\r\nbe gained, and the little wild heart won by quiet and unvarying\r\nkindness, and also by the endeavour to imitate as much as possible the\r\nnatural surroundings of its own life before its capture. I must confess\r\nit requires a large fund of patience to tame any wild creature, and it\r\nis rarely possible to succeed unless one's efforts begin in its very\r\nearly days, before it has known the sweets of liberty.\r\n\r\nIn many cases I have kept a wild animal or bird for a few days to learn\r\nsomething of its ways, possibly to make a drawing of its attitudes or\r\nplumage, and then let it go, else nearly all my pets, except imported\r\ncreatures, have been reared from infancy, an invalid's life and\r\nwakefulness making early-morning feeding of young fledglings less\r\ndifficult than it would have been in many cases, and often have painful\r\nhours been made bearable and pleasant by the interest arising from\r\ncareful observation of the habits and ways of some new pet animal or\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nI have always strongly maintained that the love of animated nature\r\nshould be fostered far more than it usually is, and especially in the\r\nminds of the young; and that, in fact, we lose an immense amount of\r\nenjoyment by passing through life as so many do without a spark of\r\ninterest in the marvellous world of nature, that book whose pages are\r\never lying open before us.\r\n\r\nThe beauties of the country might as well have been left uncreated for\r\nall the interest that thousands take in them. Not only town dwellers,\r\nwho might be excused for their ignorance, but those who live in the\r\nmidst of fields and woods, often know so little about the curious\r\ncreatures in fur and feathers that exist around them that they are\r\nsurprised when told the simplest facts about these, their near\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nOne reason may be, that it is now so much the fashion to spend the year\r\nin various places, and those always moving about have neither the time\r\nnor opportunity to cultivate the little undergrowths of quiet pleasures\r\nwhich spring out of a settled home in the country, with its well-tended\r\ngarden and farmyard, greenhouses, stable, and fields--the horses and\r\ncattle, petted and kindly cared for from their birth, dogs and poultry,\r\nand all kinds of special favourites.\r\n\r\nThere is a healthy, happy tone about such a life, and where it exists\r\nand is rightly maintained, good influence is, or ought to be, felt in\r\nand around the home. Almost all children have a natural love of living\r\ncreatures, and if they are told interesting facts about them they soon\r\nbecome ardent naturalists. I well remember that in my childhood I had a\r\ngreat dread of toads and frogs, and a relative, to whom I owe much for\r\nhaving directed my mind into the love of animated nature, took up a frog\r\nin her hand and made me look at the beautiful gold circle round its\r\neyes, its curious webbed feet, its leaping power arising from the long\r\nhind legs; she told me also of its wonderful tongue, so long and\r\nflexible that it folded back in its mouth, and that the frog would sit\r\nat the edge of an ant-hill and throwing out the tongue with its sticky\r\npoint, would pick off the ants one by one as they came out. When I\r\nlearnt all this, I began to watch such a curious reptile; my fears\r\nvanished, and like Kingsley's little daughter, who had been wisely led\r\nto care for all living things and came running to show her father a\r\n\"dear delightful worm\" she had found! so I, too, have been led all\r\nthrough my life to regard every created thing, great or small,\r\nattractive or otherwise, as an object well worth the most reverent\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to explain that I have described methods of taming,\r\nfeeding, and housing one's pets with extreme minuteness in order to help\r\nthose of my readers who may be very fond of live creatures, and yet from\r\nlack of opportunity may have gained no knowledge of their mode of life,\r\nand what is required to keep them happily in health and vigour. I have\r\nhad to learn by experience that attention to very small details is the\r\nroad to success in keeping pets as well as in other things, and the\r\ndesire to pass on that experience must be my excuse to more scientific\r\nreaders for seeming triviality.\r\n\r\nMany admirable books have been written by those well qualified to impart\r\ntheir knowledge in every branch of Natural History, and the more such\r\nbooks are read the better, but the following pages simply contain the\r\nlife histories of my pets and what I personally have observed about\r\nthem. I shall be glad indeed if they supply any useful information, or\r\nlead others to the more careful study of the common every-day things\r\naround them with a view to more kindness being shown to all living\r\ncreatures, and tender consideration for them. I trust I may feel that\r\nthis little book will then have attained its purpose. May it especially\r\ntend to lead the young to see how this beautiful world is full of\r\nwonders of every kind, full of evidences of the Great Creator's wisdom\r\nand skill in adapting each created thing to its special purpose, and\r\nfrom the whole realm of nature may they be taught lessons in parables,\r\nand their hearts be led upward to God Himself, who made all things to\r\nreflect His own perfection and glory.\r\n\r\n    \"Gem, flower, and fish, the bird, the brute,\r\n       Of every kind occult or known\r\n    (Each exquisitely form'd to suit\r\n       Its humble lot, and that alone),\r\n    Through ocean, earth, and air fulfil\r\n    Unconsciously their Maker's will.\"\r\n\r\n                                  ELIZA BRIGHTWEN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREARING BIRDS FROM THE NEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most delightful of all pets are the birds one has taken the pains to\r\nrear from the nest; they never miss the freedom of outdoor life, they\r\nhardly know what fear is, they become devotedly attached to the one who\r\nfeeds and educates them, and all their winsome ways seem developed by\r\nthe love and care which is given to them.\r\n\r\nI strongly deprecate a whole nest being taken; one would not willingly\r\ngive the happy little parent birds the distress of finding an empty\r\nhome. After all their trouble in building, laying, sitting, and\r\nhatching, surely they deserve the reward of bringing up their little\r\nbabes.\r\n\r\nToo often when boys thus take a nest they simply let the young birds\r\nstarve to death from ignorance as to their proper food and not rising\r\nearly enough to feed them.\r\n\r\nIt is a different matter if, out of a family of six, one takes two to\r\nbring up by hand--the labour of the old birds is lightened, and four\r\nfledglings will sufficiently reward their toil.\r\n\r\nThe birds should be taken before they are really feathered, just when\r\nthe young quills begin to show, as at that stage they will not notice\r\nthe change in their diet and manner of feeding. They need to be\r\ncarefully protected from cold, kept at first in a covered basket in\r\nflannel, and if the weather is cold they should be near a fire, as they\r\nmiss the warmth of the mother bird, especially at night.\r\n\r\nI confess it involves a good deal of trouble to undertake the care of\r\nthese helpless little creatures. They should be fed every half-hour,\r\nfrom four in the morning until late in the evening, and that for many\r\nweeks until they are able to feed themselves.\r\n\r\nThe kind of food varies according to the bird we desire to bring up, and\r\nit requires care to make sure that it is not too dry or too moist, and\r\nthat it has not become sour, or it will soon prove fatal, for young\r\nbirds have not the sense of older ones--they take blindly whatever is\r\ngiven them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STARLINGS.]\r\n\r\nDICK THE STARLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew people would think a cat could possibly be a tender nurse to young\r\nbirds! but such was really the case with a very interesting bird I\r\npossessed some years ago.\r\n\r\nA young starling was brought up from the nest by the kind care of our\r\ncook and the cat! Both were equally sympathetic, and pitied the little\r\nunfledged creature, who was by some accident left motherless in his\r\nearly youth. Cook used to get up at some unheard-of hour in the morning\r\nto feed her clamorous pet, and then would bring him down with her at\r\nbreakfast-time and consign him to pussy's care; she, receiving him with\r\na gentle purr of delight, would let him nestle into her soft fur for\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nAs Dick became feathered, he was allowed the run of the house and\r\ngarden, and used to spend an hour or so on the lawn, digging his beak\r\ninto the turf, seeking for worms and grubs, and when tired he would fly\r\nin at the open window and career about until he could perch on my\r\nshoulder, or go in search of his two foster-mothers in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nHis education was carried on with such success that he could soon speak\r\na few words very clearly. Strangers used to be rather startled by a\r\nweird-looking bird flying in from the garden, and saying, \"Beauty dear,\r\npuss, puss, miaow!\" But it was still more strange to see Dick sitting on\r\nthe cat's back and addressing his endearments to her in the above words.\r\nPussy would allow him to investigate her fur with exemplary patience,\r\nonly objecting to his inquisitive beak being applied to her eyelids to\r\nprize them open when she was enjoying her afternoon nap. Dick's love of\r\nwater led him to bathe in most inconvenient places. One morning, when I\r\nreturned to the dining-room after a few minutes' absence, I found him\r\ntaking headers into a glass filter and scattering the contents on the\r\nsideboard. After dinner, too, he would dive into the finger-glasses with\r\nthe same intention, and when hindered in that design would visit the\r\ndessert dishes in succession, stopping with an emphatic \"Beauty dear!\"\r\nat the sight of some coveted dainty, to which he would forthwith help\r\nhimself liberally.\r\n\r\nIn summer Dick had to resist considerable temptation from wild birds of\r\nhis own kind, who evidently made matrimonial overtures to him, but\r\nthough he \"camped out\" for a few nights now and then, he never seemed to\r\nfind a mate to his mind, and elected to remain a bachelor and enjoy our\r\nsociety instead of that of his own kith and kin.\r\n\r\nDick was certainly a pattern of industrious activity, never still for\r\ntwo minutes. He seemed haunted by the idea that caterpillars and grubs\r\nexisted all over the house, and his search for them was carried on under\r\nall possible circumstances--every plait of one's dress, every\r\nbutton-hole, would be inquired into by his prying little beak in case\r\nsome choice morsel might chance to be lurking there. Dick lived for a\r\nfew happy years, and then his bathing propensities most unhappily led to\r\nhis untimely death. One severely cold day in winter he was missed and\r\nsearched for everywhere, and after some hours his poor little body was\r\nfound stiff and cold in a water-tank in the stable-yard, where the ice\r\nhad been broken. He had as usual plunged in for a bath, and we can only\r\nsuppose the intense cold had caused an attack of cramp, so that he could\r\nnot get out again, and thus was drowned. Many tears were shed for the\r\nloss of the cheery little bird, who seemed like a bright ubiquitous\r\nsunbeam about the house, and our only consolation was the thought that,\r\nas far as we knew, he had never had a sorrow in his life, and we can\r\nonly hope that if there are \"happy hunting-grounds\" for birds our Dick\r\nmay be there, bright and happy still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING STARLINGS]\r\n\r\nRICHARD THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a wet stormy day in May a young unfledged bird was blown out of its\r\nnest and was picked up in a paved yard where, somehow, it had fallen\r\nunhurt.\r\n\r\nThere he was found by my kind-hearted butler, who appeared with the\r\nlittle shivering thing in his hand to see if I would adopt it. The\r\nbutler pleaded for it, and it squawked its own petition piteously\r\nenough, but I was far from strong, and I knew at what very early hours\r\nthese young feathered people required to be fed. I therefore felt I\r\nought hardly to give up the time which sometimes brought me the precious\r\nboon of sleep after a wakeful night. Very reluctantly I refused the\r\ngift, and felt wretchedly hard-hearted in doing so. I will confide to my\r\nreaders that in my secret heart I thought the poor orphan was a\r\nblackbird or thrush, and they are birds I feel ought never to be caged;\r\nthey pine and look so sadly longing for liberty; even their song has a\r\nminor key of plaintiveness when it comes through prison bars, and this\r\nfeeling helped my decision.\r\n\r\nA few days after I heard that the birdie was adopted in the pantry, and\r\nwas being fed \"in the intervals of business.\" When a few days later I\r\nwas definitely informed that the birdie waif was a starling, then I\r\nconfess I did begin to long for another little friend such as my former\r\n\"Dick\" had been, and it ended in my receiving Richard the Second, as we\r\ncalled him for distinction, into my own care and keeping, and month\r\nafter month I was his much-enduring mother. Most fledglings are much the\r\nsame at first; whenever I came in sight the gaping beak was ever ready\r\nfor food, and the capacity for receiving it was wonderful. Richard grew\r\nvery fast; little quills appeared and opened out into feathers; his\r\nwalking powers increased till he could make a tottering run upon the\r\ncarpet; and then he began to object to his basket and would have a perch\r\nlike a grown-up bird, practised going to sleep on one leg, which for a\r\nlong time was a downright failure and ended in constant tumbles.\r\n\r\nHe was always out of his cage whilst I was dressing, and was full of fun\r\nand play, scheming to get his bath before I did, and running off with\r\nanything he could carry. When he was about two months old I had to go to\r\nBuxton for a month's visit and decided that I could not leave Richard\r\nbehind, as he needed constant feeding with little pieces of raw meat and\r\nwas just old enough to miss my training and care. He was therefore to\r\nmake his first start as a traveller, in a small cage, papered round the\r\nsides, the top being left open for light and air. He was wonderfully\r\nbrave and good, very observant of everything, and if scared a word from\r\nme would reassure him, until at last even an express train dashing past\r\ndid not make him start. It was very amusing to see the attention\r\nbestowed upon him at the various stations where we had to get out. A\r\nlittle crowd would gather round and stare at such a self-possessed small\r\nbird. I was asked \"if it was a very rare bird?\" It seemed almost absurd\r\nto have to reply, \"No, only a common starling;\" but people are so\r\naccustomed to see a caged pet flutter in terror at its unusual\r\nsurroundings, that my kingly Richard rather puzzled his admirers.\r\n\r\nWhen we began life in our apartments, one important consideration in the\r\nday's proceedings was the starling's food. There was no home larder to\r\nfall back upon, so a daily portion of tender rump-steak had to be\r\nobtained, to the great amusement of the butcher with whom we dealt for\r\nour own joints.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the plain grey plumage began to be varied by two patches\r\nof brilliant little purple feathers, tipped with greyish-white, which\r\nappeared on each side of his breast. Some began to peep out of his back\r\nand head. He moulted his tail, and had rich, dark feathers all over, in\r\ntime, till he arrived at being what he was often called, \"a perfect\r\nbeauty\"--glossy and brilliant, bronze gold and purple, with reflets of\r\nrich green, and little specks of greyish-white all over his breast; this\r\nrichness of colour, combined with his beautiful sleek shape, made\r\nRichard a very attractive bird.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned from Buxton, I was so confident of the bird's tameness\r\nI used to carry him in my hand out to the tulip tree, and there I often\r\nsat and read, while Richard would pry into the moss and the bark of the\r\ntree, searching for insects, and though he could fly well by this time,\r\nhe did not try to do so, but seemed content to keep near me.\r\n\r\nOne morning I heard his first articulate word, \"Beauty,\" spoken so\r\nclearly it quite startled me. I had been diligently teaching him, by\r\nconstant repetition, for many weeks, and by degrees he gained the power\r\nof speaking one word after another, till at last he was able to say,\r\n\"Little beauty,\" \"'Ow de doo?\" \"Pretty, pretty,\" \"Beauty, dear,\" \"Puss,\r\npuss,\" \"Miaow,\" and imitated kissing exactly. All this was intermingled\r\nwith his native whistle and sundry inarticulate sounds, intended, I\r\nsuppose, to result in words and sentences some day. Whilst talking and\r\nsinging, his head was held very upright, and his wings flapped\r\nincessantly against his sides, after the manner of the wild birds.\r\n\r\nNothing stirred my indignation more keenly than the question so often\r\nasked, \"Have you had your starling's tongue slit to make him talk so\r\nwell?\" I beg emphatically to entreat all my readers to do their utmost\r\nto put an end to this cruel and perfectly useless custom. My bird's\r\ntalking powers were remarkable, but they were the result of his\r\nintelligence being drawn out and cultivated by constant, loving care,\r\nattention to his little wants, and being talked to and played with, and\r\nmade into a little feathered friend of the family.\r\n\r\nNow must be told an episode which cost me no little heartache. Richard\r\nwas out in my room one morning as usual, when the room door happening to\r\nbe open, away he flew into the next room, and out at an open window into\r\nthe garden. I saw him alight on a tree, but by the time I could reach\r\nthe garden he had gone. I saw a group of starlings in a beech tree near\r\nby, and another set were chattering on the house roof, but there was no\r\ntelling if my Richard was one of them. I called till I was tired, and\r\ncontinued to do so at intervals all day, but no wanderer appeared. His\r\ncage had been put on the lawn, but to no purpose. I feared I should\r\nnever see my pet again, because I supposed he might be lured by the wild\r\nbirds till he got out of hearing of any familiar voice. I confess it was\r\nhard to think of my bright young birdie starving under some hedge, for I\r\nfelt sure he was too much of a gentleman from his artificial bringing-up\r\nto be able to earn his own living. All I could do was to resolve to be\r\nup very early next day, and call again and again, on the chance of his\r\nbeing within hearing. Before six o'clock next morning I was seeking the\r\ntruant. Plenty of wild birds were about, the bright sun glancing on\r\ntheir sleek coats--all looking so like my pet it was impossible to\r\ndistinguish him. I little knew that he was then starving and miserable\r\nunder a bush in the upper part of the garden. I continued calling and\r\nseeking him until breakfast-time, and fast losing all hope of ever\r\nseeing him again. About eleven o'clock I was returning from the kitchen\r\ngarden, with my hands full of fruit and flowers, when, to my intense\r\ndelight, poor little Richard came slowly out from under a laurel, and\r\nstood in the path before me, as veritable a type of a birdish prodigal\r\nson as could well be imagined.\r\n\r\nHis feathers were ruffled, his wings drooping, his whole aspect\r\nirresistibly reminded one of the Jackdaw of Rheims; and the way he\r\nsidled up to me, with half-closed eyes and drooping head, was one of the\r\nmost pathetic things I ever experienced. He so plainly said, \"I'm very\r\nsorry--hope you'll forgive me; won't do it again\"; and certainly his\r\nmute appeal was not in vain, for down went my fruit and flowers, and\r\nwith loving words I took up my lost darling, and cooed over him all\r\nsorts of affectionate rubbish until we reached home and he was restored\r\nto his cage. There his one desire was water. Poor fellow! he was nearly\r\nfamished. I think another hour would have seen his end. There is no\r\nwater in the garden, except in the stone vase in front of the\r\ndining-room window, and he would not have known how to find that, so he\r\nmust have been twenty-eight hours without drinking anything beyond a\r\npossible drop of dew now and then. I had to feed him with great care--a\r\nlittle food, and very often, until he recovered a measure of strength.\r\nHe was very drooping all day, and I quite feared he might not live after\r\nall, he was so nearly starved to death. After some days, however,\r\n\"Richard was himself again,\" and as bright and amusing as ever. I have\r\nnot related the amusing characteristics of his \"daily tub.\" His love of\r\nwater was a perfect passion, and water he would have. At first he was\r\ntreated to a large glass dish on the matting in the dining-room, but he\r\nsent up such a perfect fountain of spray over curtains, couch, and\r\nchairs, that the housemaid voted \"that bird\" a nuisance, and a better\r\nplan was devised. In the conservatory is a pool of water, with rock-work\r\nand ferns at the back, and there is a central tube where a fountain can\r\nbe turned on. I made a small island of green moss a little above the\r\nwater, and, placing Richard upon it, I turned the fountain on to play a\r\ndelicate shower of spray over him. He was perfectly enchanted, and\r\nfluttered, turned about, and frisked, like a bird possessed. As he\r\nbecame accustomed to it, I began to throw handfuls of water over him,\r\nand that he did enjoy. He would cower down, and lie with his wings\r\nexpanded and beak open, receiving charge after charge of water till\r\nquite out of breath; then he would run a few paces away on his island\r\ntill he recovered himself, and then would go back and place himself\r\nready for a renewed douche. I never saw such a plucky bird. If I had\r\nbeen trying to drown him I could not have done more, for sometimes he\r\nwas knocked backwards into the pool; but no matter, he was up again, and\r\nall ready in a minute. He generally tired me out, and when I turned off\r\nthe fountain, he would either fly or run after me into the drawing-room\r\nand go into his cage, which always stood there; and there followed a\r\nvery careful toilette--a general oiling and pluming and fluttering,\r\nuntil his bonnie little feathers were all in good order; and then would\r\nfollow endless chatter, and he would inform the world that he was a\r\n\"little beauty,\" \"pretty little dear,\" &c.\r\n\r\nStarlings seem to have an abundant supply of natural oil in the gland\r\nwhere it is stored, for his feathers were never really much wetted by\r\nhis tremendous baths, and he was a slippery fellow to hold, his plumage\r\nwas so glossy and sleek.\r\n\r\nA word must be said about his temper; it was decidedly not meek by any\r\nmeans, and his will was strong, so the least thing would bring a shower\r\nof pecks in token of disapproval, and if scolded his attitude was most\r\nabsurd; he would draw himself up to a wonderful height, set up his crest\r\nfeathers, and stand ready to meet all comers, like a little fighting\r\ncock; and when a finger was pointed at him he would scold and peck, and\r\nflap with his wings with the utmost fury; and yet if a kind word was\r\nsaid all his wrath vanished, and he would come on your hand and prize\r\nyour fingers apart, looking for grubs as usual. It seemed strange that\r\nhis habit of thus searching for insects everywhere should continue,\r\nthough he was never by any chance rewarded by finding one. A starling's\r\nrange of ideas may be summed up in the word \"Grubs.\" It was always\r\nimmensely amusing to strangers to see Richard, when out in the room,\r\nsearching with his inquisitive beak in the most hopeless places with a\r\ncheerful happy activity, as if he always felt sure that long-looked-for\r\ngrub, for which he had searched all the years of his life, must be close\r\nby, round the corners somewhere, under the penwiper, behind that book,\r\namongst these coloured silks; and if interfered with he would give a\r\npeck and a chirp, as much as to say, \"Do let me alone, I'm busy; I've\r\ngot my living to get, and grubs seem scarce.\" Richard was the only bird\r\nI have ever had who learnt the nature of windows, he never flew against\r\nthem; he had one or two severe concussions, and being a very sensible\r\nbird he \"concluded\" he wouldn't do it again; he would fly backwards and\r\nforwards in the drawing-room in swift flight, but I never feared either\r\nthe windows or the fire, as he avoided both.\r\n\r\nSeveral times Master Richard was found flying about in the drawing-room,\r\nand yet no one had let him out; we could only suppose that by some\r\nmischance the door must have been left open; yet we all felt morally\r\ncertain it had been fastened properly, and there was much puzzlement\r\nabout the matter.\r\n\r\nHowever, the mystery was soon solved by my watching Richard's\r\nproceedings. I heard a prolonged hammering and found he was at work upon\r\nthe hasp of his cage door. He managed to raise it up higher and higher,\r\ntill by a well-directed peck he sent it clear out of the loop of wire\r\nwhich held it in its place. Still the door was shut, and it required a\r\ngood many more pecks to force it open, but he succeeded in time, and out\r\nhe flew--delighted to find himself entirely master of the situation.\r\nThen I watched with much amusement his deliberate survey of the room.\r\n\r\nI was ill at the time, and he first flew to greet me and talk a little;\r\nhe hopped upon my hand, and holding firmly on my forefinger he went\r\nthrough his usual morning toilette, first an application to his oil\r\ngland, then he touched up all his plumage, drew out his wing and tail\r\nfeathers, fluttered himself into shape, and when quite in order he began\r\nto examine the contents of my breakfast tray; took a little sugar,\r\nlooked to see if there were any grubs under the tray cloth, peered into\r\nthe cream jug, decided that he didn't like the salt, gave me two or\r\nthree hard pecks to express his profound affection, and then went off on\r\na voyage of discovery, _autour de ma chambre_. He squeezed himself\r\nbetween every ornament on the mantlepiece, flew to the drawers, and\r\nfound there some grapes which were very much to his taste; so he was\r\nbusy for some time helping himself. He visited every piece of furniture,\r\nthrew down all the little items that he could lift, and, as I was\r\nreading, I did not particularly notice what he was about, until he came\r\non a small table near my bed, and then I heard a suspicious noise, and\r\nturned to find the indefatigable bird with his beak in my ink bottle,\r\nand the sheet already plentifully bespattered with black splashes and\r\nlittle streams of ink trickling over the table cover; such misplaced\r\nzeal was not to be borne, so Richard had to be caged. When he was seven\r\nmonths old, his beak began to turn from black to yellow. The colour\r\nbegan to show first at the base of the beak, and it went on gradually,\r\nuntil in a month's time it was nearly all yellow, though it was black at\r\nthe tip for some time longer. As time went on, Richard's talking powers\r\nincreased; he quite upset any grave conversation that might be going on;\r\nhis voice dropped at times to a sort of stage whisper, as if he wished\r\nto convey some profound secrets. \"Oh, you little beauty, pretty little\r\ndear, 'ow de doo?\" used to mingle most absurdly with the conversation of\r\nhis elders and betters. When he could not have his bath in the\r\nconservatory, I used still to give him his glass dish, which we used\r\ntogether, for he would never enjoy his ablutions without me, and I\r\nbecame considerably sprinkled in the process. His delight was to have a\r\nwater fight, pecking at my fingers, scolding, as if in a great rage,\r\nusing his claws, and all the while calling me \"Dear little Dicky;\r\nbeauty; pretty little dear,\" &c., for he had no harder words to scold\r\nwith; certainly the effect was most comical. When he supposed he had\r\ngained the victory, he would settle down to a regular bathe, fluttering\r\nand taking headers until he was dripping wet and delightfully happy, and\r\nthe next thing would be to perch on one's chair, and shake a regular\r\nshower of drops over one's books or work.\r\n\r\nRichard was not, as a rule, at all frightened by noises, or by being\r\ncarried about in his cage in strange places, but early one morning, when\r\nhe was out in my room, he flew away from the window with a piercing\r\nscream of terror, and hid himself quite in the dark, behind my pillow,\r\nshivering with fright, as if he felt his last hour had come. We found\r\nout, when this had occurred several times, that his _bete noire_ was a\r\ngreat heron, which used occasionally to leave the lake, and circle round\r\nthe house, high up in the air. It could only have been by pure instinct\r\nthat Richard was inspired with such terror whenever he saw the great\r\nwinged bird, and it showed that artificial training, though it develops\r\nadditional powers and habits, in no way interferes with natural\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nThe starling has a remarkably active brain; its quickness of movement,\r\nswift flight, and never-tiring activity, all show the working of its\r\ninner mind; but more than that, it seems to be capable of something akin\r\nto reasoning. Richard sometimes dropped a piece of meat on his sanded\r\nfloor, and I have often seen him take it up and well rinse it in his\r\nwater, till the sand was cleansed away, and then he would swallow it;\r\nand a dry piece of meat he would moisten in the same way. Now this\r\ninvolved a good deal of mental intuition, and I often wondered whether\r\nhe found out that water would remove the sand by accident, or by a\r\nprocess of thought; in either case, it showed cleverness and\r\nadaptability. So also with the processes of opening the door of his\r\ncage. He had first to prize up the latch with his beak to a certain\r\nheight, and then by sudden sharp pecks send it clear of the hasp; then\r\ndescend to the floor, and by straight pecks send the door open. If he\r\ncould not get the door to open thus, he understood at once that the\r\nlatch was not clear of the hasp, so he went back to his perch and pecked\r\nat it until he saw it fall down, and then he knew all was right.\r\n\r\nWhen the second summer of Richard's life came round, some young\r\nstarlings were obtained, as we much wished to rear a hen as a mate for\r\nRichard in the following year. These birds were placed in a cage in the\r\nsame room with him, as we hoped he would prove their tutor, and save us\r\nthe trouble of teaching them. But no; Richard evidently felt profoundly\r\njealous of these intruders, and day after day remained perfectly dumb\r\nand out of temper. This went on for a week, and then fearing he might\r\nlose his talking powers, I was obliged to remove them and pay special\r\nattention to him, to soothe his ruffled feelings. He did not begin to\r\ntalk until more than a week had passed by, evidently resolving to mark\r\nin this way his extreme displeasure at others being admitted to share\r\nour friendship--a curious instance of innate jealousy in a bird's mind.\r\n\r\nFor more than five years Richard was a source of constant pleasure and\r\namusement, and was so much a part of my home-life that when anything\r\nunusual happened, in the way of a garden-party or a change in daily\r\nevents from any cause, one's first thought was to provide for his\r\ncomfort being undisturbed. I confess I dreaded the thought of his\r\ngrowing old, and could not bear to look on to the time when I must learn\r\nto do without his sweet, cheering little voice and pleasant\r\ncompanionship. Alas! that time has come, and I must now tell how the\r\nlittle life was quenched.\r\n\r\nIn a room to which he had access, there was a small aquarium half-full\r\nof water thickly covered with pond-weed. I had left Richard to have his\r\nusual bath whilst I went down to breakfast, and when I returned I could\r\nnowhere find my pet. His usual bath was unused; I called and searched,\r\nand at last in the adjoining room I saw the little motionless body\r\nfloating in the aquarium. The temptation had been too strong; Richard\r\nthought to have a lovely bathe, had flown down into the water, no doubt\r\nhis claws were hopelessly entangled in the weed and thus, as was the\r\ncase with my former starling Dick, the intense love of bathing led to a\r\nfatal end.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow one feels for the loss of a pet so interwoven with one's life\r\nis very real; many may smile at it and call it weakness, but true lovers\r\nof animals and birds will know what a blank is felt and how intensely I\r\nshall ever regret the untimely fate of my much-loved little Richard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVERDANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in early summer I found on a gravel walk a poor little unfledged\r\nbirdie, sitting calmly looking up into the air, as if he hoped that some\r\nhelp would come to him, some pitying hand and heart have compassion upon\r\nhis desolate condition.\r\n\r\nI carried him indoors, and \"mothered\" the little helpless thing as well\r\nas I could, by feeding him with hard-boiled yolk of egg mixed with brown\r\nbread and water. Being a hard-billed bird, I supposed that would be\r\nsuitable food, and certainly he throve upon it. The little blue quills\r\nbegan to tell of coming feathers, his vigorous chirpings betokened\r\nplenty of vocal power, and in due time he grew into a young greenfinch\r\nof the most irrepressible and enterprising character. His lovely hues of\r\ngreen and yellow led to the name of Verdant being bestowed upon him, and\r\nhis early experiences made it a somewhat suitable name.\r\n\r\nPoor little man! he had no parents to instruct him, and he consequently\r\ngot into all manner of scrapes. He only learnt the nature of windows and\r\nlooking-glasses by bitter experience; flying against them with great\r\nforce, he was often taken up for dead; but his solid little skull\r\nresisted all these concussions, and by pouring cold water upon his head\r\nand some down his throat, he always managed to recover. He once\r\noverbalanced into a bath, and was nearly drowned; he fell behind a\r\nwardrobe, and was nearly suffocated; later on he almost squeezed himself\r\nto death between the bars of his cage--in fact, he had endless escapes\r\nof various kinds. He was very amusing in his early youth. Whilst I was\r\ndressing he would delight in picking up my scissors, pins, buttonhook,\r\nand anything else he could lift, and would carry them to the edge of the\r\ndressing-table and throw them down, turning his sly little head to see\r\nwhere they had fallen. He delighted in mischief, and was ever on the\r\nwatch to carry off or misplace things; and yet he was a winning little\r\npet, fearless in his confidence, perching on one's head or shoulder, and\r\nhindering all dressing operations by calmly placing his little body in\r\nthe way, regardless of consequences.\r\n\r\nHe lived in his cage during the day, and next to him, on the same table,\r\nlived a bullfinch--a very handsome bird, but heavy and lethargic to a\r\ndegree; he sang exquisitely, and for that gift I suppose Verdant admired\r\nhim, for his delight was to be as near him as possible. Perched on the\r\ntop of his cage, he gazed down at his friend, and in great measure\r\nimitated his singing. Bully, on the contrary, hated Verdant, and would\r\nhave nothing to do with him. The two characters were a great source of\r\namusement to us.\r\n\r\nVerdant was always let out at meal-times to fly about and enjoy his\r\nliberty, and I am sorry to say he was always on the look-out for any\r\nmischief that might be possible. Bully's water-jar was fastened outside\r\nby a small pin; this Verdant discovered was movable, and before long we\r\nwere startled by the fall of the said water-jar, the greenfinch having\r\npulled out the pin; he then began upon the seed-box, and that also fell,\r\nto his great delight; he was then talked to and scolded, and up went his\r\npretty yellow wings with angry flappings, and his open beak scolded back\r\nagain in the most hardened manner. He was greatly interested in watching\r\nthe numerous birds frequenting a basket filled with fat which hung\r\noutside the window, and he would swing backwards and forwards on the\r\ntassel of the blind, chirping to the outsiders, and watching all their\r\nlittle squabbles. Sunflower seeds were his greatest dainty; he would\r\nperch upon the hand to receive one, or if it were held between the lips\r\nhe would flutter and poise upon the wing to take it. A sort of swing\r\nwith a chain and movable wheel was provided, upon which Verdant soon\r\nlearned to perch and swing, whilst he amused himself by pecking at the\r\nchain till he disengaged the sunflower seeds I had fixed in the links.\r\nWhen he was more than a year old, and I thought he might be depended\r\nupon, I tried the rather anxious experiment of letting him out of doors.\r\nHe soon became quietly happy, investigating the wonders of tree\r\nbranches, inquiring into the taste of leaves and all kind of novelties,\r\nwhen two or three sparrows flew at him and scared him considerably. Away\r\nhe went, followed by the sparrows, and I began to repent my experiment,\r\nand feared he might go beyond my ken and lose himself. He was out nearly\r\nan hour, but at last he returned and went quietly into his cage. It\r\nseemed strange that the wild birds should so soon discover that he was\r\nnot one of their clique, but I suppose Verdant revealed the secret by\r\nlooking frightened, and the others could not resist the fun of chasing\r\nhim. For more than a year and a half my birdie was a constant pleasure.\r\nWhenever he entered the dining-room my first act was to open Verdant's\r\ncage, when he would always fly to the bullfinch's cage and greet him\r\nwith a chirp, then look to see if his friend had any provender that he\r\ncould get at--a piece of lettuce between the bars, or a spray of millet\r\nto which he could help himself; no matter that Bully remonstrated with\r\nopen beak, Verdant calmly feasted on stolen goods _con gusto_, and then\r\nscouted around for any dainties on the carpet, where he sometimes found\r\na stray sunflower seed, always his greatest delight. After his summer\r\nmoulting he became wonderfully vigorous, and would fly round the room\r\nwith such velocity that I often felt afraid he might some day fly\r\nagainst the plate-glass windows and injure himself.\r\n\r\nThat mournful day came at last! He had been out as usual at\r\nbreakfast-time, came on my finger for a seed, had his bath, and went on\r\nthe little swing for more seeds, and flew about with all his joyous life\r\nand vigour. We had only left the room for a few moments, when, on\r\nreturning, the dear little bird lay dead beneath the window, against\r\nwhich he had flown with such force as to break his neck and cause\r\ninstant death.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow of that moment will never be forgotten; indeed, I cannot even\r\nnow think of my little pet with undimmed eyes--he was a moment before so\r\nfull of life and beauty, so fearless, such a \"sonsie\" little fellow;\r\nand then to hold the little golden green body in my hand and watch the\r\nfast-glazing eye, and think that I should never again have my cheery\r\nlittle friend to greet me and be glad at my coming, was one of those\r\nsharp pangs that true lovers of nature alone can understand. From all\r\nsuch I know I shall have sympathy in the tragic death of my much-loved\r\nlittle Verdant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD DUCK.]\r\n\r\nTHE WILD DUCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN our grass was being cut the mowers came upon a wild duck's nest\r\ncontaining eight eggs; they were carried whilst still warm and placed\r\nunder a sitting hen; in a week's time she brought out eight fluffy\r\nlittle ducklings, which were placed with her under a coop in the\r\nfarmyard. I paid them a visit the next day, but, alas! I saw four little\r\ncorpses lying about in the grass, the remaining four were chirping\r\npiteously, and the hen was in despair at being unable to comfort her\r\nuncanny children. Evidently their diet was in fault; I thought I would\r\ntake them in hand, and therefore had the coop brought round to the\r\ngarden, and placed under the drooping boughs of a deodar near the\r\ndrawing-room window, where I could watch over them.\r\n\r\nI gave the wee birdies a pan of water, and placed in it some\r\nfinely-shred lettuce, with grits and brown bread crumbs, not forgetting\r\nsuitable food for the poor distracted hen. It was charming to hear the\r\nlittle happy twitterings of the downy babes, how they gobbled and\r\nsputtered and talked to each other over their repast, swimming to and\r\nfro as if they had been ducks of mature age and experience, instead of\r\nmere yellow fluffs of a day old; and, finally, they seemed to remember\r\nthey had a warm, comfortable mother somewhere, and sought refuge under\r\nher kindly wings, where I left them exchanging confidences in little\r\ndrowsy chirps.\r\n\r\nI found it needful to guard my little brood with fine wire-work, for\r\nsome carrion crows kept hovering near, and a weasel was constantly on\r\nthe watch to carry them off; but these enemies were successfully\r\nbaffled, and three of the ducks survived all dangers and grew to\r\nbeautiful maturity, the fourth having died in infancy from an accidental\r\npeck from the hen. In rearing all wild creatures the great thing is to\r\nstudy and imitate, as nearly as possible, their natural surroundings,\r\nand especially their diet. Chopped lettuce and worms made a fair\r\nsubstitute for their natural food, but the jubilation that went on when\r\na mass of water-weed, full of insects, water snails, &c., was brought\r\nthem, showed that they knew by instinct what suited them best. With\r\nconstant care and attention they grew very tame, and would eat out of\r\none's hand, and when let out of the coop would follow me to a certain\r\nheap of dead leaves where worms abounded, and there, with the most\r\namusing eagerness, they pounced upon their wriggling prey, snatching the\r\nworms out of each other's beak, and tumbling over one another in their\r\nexcitement, all the while making a special chirp of exceeding happiness.\r\n\r\nThey were named Tiny, Sir Francis Drake, and Luther--I fear the last\r\nname had a covert allusion to the \"Diet of Worms.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the purple feathers began to show in their wings, and they\r\nconsidered themselves quite too old to pay any allegiance to their\r\nhen-mother, they began to absent themselves for some hours each\r\nafternoon, and this, too, in a most secret fashion, for I could never\r\ntell how they disappeared, but they returned in due time, walking\r\nquietly in Indian file, and lay down in their coop. At last I traced\r\nthem to a pond a long distance off--it really seemed as if they had\r\nscented the water, for they had to traverse a lawn and wood, go across a\r\ndrive, and through a hedge and field, and then the pond was in a hollow\r\nwhere they could not possibly have seen it; but there I found my little\r\nfriends in high glee, darting over the surface of the water, splashing,\r\ndiving, sending up showers of spray from their wings, and going on as if\r\nthey were possessed. I called to them, and in a moment they quieted\r\ndown, and behaved exactly as children would have done when caught\r\ntripping--they came out of the water and followed me, in the meekest and\r\nmost penitent manner, back to their home under the deodar.\r\n\r\nThese birds would stay the whole morning with me in perfect content if\r\nthey were allowed to nestle into a wool mat placed at the doorstep of\r\nthe French window leading out upon the lawn; there they would plume\r\nthemselves and sometimes preen each other, and I could watch the way in\r\nwhich the feathers were drawn through the apparently awkward bill, yet I\r\nsuppose so suited for its various uses; anyway the feathers came out\r\nfrom its manipulations as smooth and sleek as velvet, and when the\r\ntoilet was over the head found its rest behind the wing, and profound\r\nsleep followed. Sometimes my friends would make a spring upon the sofa\r\nby my side, I fear with a view to forthcoming worms, of which they well\r\nknew I was the purveyor; and nothing could exceed the slyness of their\r\neyes as they looked up at me and mutely suggested an expedition to that\r\nheap of leaves!\r\n\r\nI must say I derived an immense amount of amusement from those ducks;\r\nthey had such innate character of their own, quite unlike any other bird\r\nI ever came across.\r\n\r\nI had often looked forward to the time when they would take to their\r\nwings and come down upon the lawn from aerial heights with a grand fuss\r\nand fluttering of wings, but that desire they never gratified. The day\r\ncame at last when I saw them circling high up in the air, so high that\r\nthey were mere specks in the sky, but where they alighted I never could\r\nfind out. They always re-appeared, walking solemnly (the little\r\nhypocrites!) one after the other, as if they had been doing nothing in\r\nparticular, and were now coming in exemplary fashion to be fed. I\r\nbelieve it is very rarely the case that wild ducks, however they may\r\nappear domesticated, will remain all the year through with those who\r\nhave reared them, and really take their place in the poultry-yard with\r\nthe other inmates. Still it has been known, and I will subjoin an\r\naccount given me by a friend, which goes to prove that such a state of\r\nthings is possible. My friend gave me in substance the following account\r\nof her wild ducks:--\r\n\r\n\"There are different kinds of wild ducks; these are mallards. The first\r\nwe had were hatched by hens. They feed with the other ducks, but show a\r\ndecided preference for Indian corn. They are very troublesome about\r\nlaying, often leaving their eggs exposed, where the crows find them and\r\ncarry them off. We gather most of them we find, to take care of them\r\n(though the ducks lay in different places each time their nest is\r\nrobbed) until there are preparations for sitting, when, if we have been\r\nfortunate enough to discover the fact, we add a number of the previously\r\ngathered eggs.\r\n\r\n\"The sitting duck comes for food every two or three days, and that is\r\nall we see of her for some time, until at length she may be seen coming\r\nthrough the meadow, the half-grown mowing grass behind her trembling and\r\nwaving in an unusual manner: by-and-by, the road or shorter grass is\r\nreached, when it is found the proud mother is bringing home her little\r\nfluffy family of perhaps eight to eleven darkie ducklings--quick,\r\nactive, tiny things that refuse at first all friendly advances, but\r\nbecoming accustomed to their surroundings soon behave much in the manner\r\nof their elders. There are dreadful fights on the pond when two or more\r\nlittle families arrive about the same time, the mother of one flock\r\ntyrannizing over the members of another, and thus causing many deaths.\r\nThey often fly away, but they always come back again. All through the\r\nwinter they go under cover with the other ducks, but when spring comes\r\nthey are not to be found at night; nevertheless they are sure to be\r\nready for breakfast next morning.\"\r\n\r\nI confess I always had a faint hope that my ducks might stay with me, or\r\nat any rate return from time to time, but their wild nature prevailed,\r\nand they finally left; only Luther reappeared alone one day and took his\r\nlast \"diet\" from my hand; but there was a look in his pretty blue eye\r\nwhich said plainly, \"You will never see me again,\" and he had his final\r\ncaress and departed \"to fresh woods and pastures new.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _TINY, SIR FRANCIS DRAKE AND LUTHER_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE JAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Jay was taken from the parent nest, built on the stem of an\r\nivy-covered tree which had been blown down in the winter. A young jay is\r\na curious-looking creature: the exquisite blue wing feathers begin to\r\nshow before the others are more than quills; the eyes are large and\r\nbright blue, and when the great beak opens it shows a large throat of\r\ndeepest carmine, so that it possesses the beauty of colour from its\r\nearliest days, and when full grown and in fine plumage it is one of the\r\nhandsomest of our birds. In its babyhood my jay was much like other\r\nyoung things of his kind, always clamouring for food, and seeming to\r\ncare for little else, but as he grew up he attached himself to me with a\r\nwonderful strength of affection which entirely reversed this order of\r\nthings, for whenever I came into the room he was restless and unhappy\r\nuntil I came near enough for him to feed me, he would look carefully\r\ninto his food-trough, and at last select what he thought the most\r\ntempting morsel, and then put it through the bars of his cage into my\r\nmouth. He would sometimes feed other people, but as a rule he disliked\r\nstrangers, and I have known him even take water in his beak and squirt\r\nit at those who displeased him. On the whole, a jay is not a very\r\ndesirable pet; he is restless in a cage, and too large to be quite\r\nconvenient when loose in a room; again, his great timidity is a\r\ndrawback--the least noise, the sight of a cat or dog, puts him in a\r\nnervous fright, and he flutters about with anxious notes of alarm. He\r\nis seen to best advantage hopping about on a lawn, where he may be\r\nattracted by acorns being strewn in winter and spring. It is a pity that\r\nhis marauding habits in game preserves lead to his being so ruthlessly\r\nshot by gamekeepers till it is almost a rare sight to see the handsome\r\nbird and hear his note of alarm in the woods. One morning I saw a jay on\r\nthe lawn near the house, and rather wondering as to what he was seeking,\r\nin a minute or two I saw him pounce upon a young half-fledged bird and\r\ncarry it off in his beak, a helpless little baby wing fluttering in the\r\nair as he flew away. Their sight is wonderfully keen, and their cunning\r\nis amusing to watch as they steal by careful steps nearer and nearer to\r\ntheir prey, and at last by a sudden dart secure it and make off in rapid\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JAY.]\r\n\r\nAfter a year or two my poor jay met with a very sad fate. A garden-party\r\nwas to take place, and knowing the jay's terror of any unusual noise or\r\nupstir, I carried his cage to a quiet room where I hoped he would be\r\nquite happy and hear nothing.\r\n\r\nI, however, did not happen to notice that, later on, the band had\r\nestablished their quarters near this room, and I suppose the unwonted\r\nsounds drove the poor bird into a wild state of terror, and that in his\r\nflutterings he had caught his leg in the bars of the cage; anyway, I\r\nwent up about the middle of the party to see how my pet was faring, when\r\nI found him in utter misery clinging to the bars, his thigh dislocated\r\nand his leg hopelessly broken. It was a mournful duty to carry him away\r\nto merciful hands that would end his torture by an instant death. For\r\nmany a day I missed that bright, handsome birdie who had always a\r\nwelcome for me and the offer of such hospitality as his cage afforded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A YOUNG CUCKOO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA YOUNG CUCKOO.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking out of my window before six o'clock one bright morning in early\r\nsummer, I chanced to see a large bird sitting quietly on the gravel\r\nwalk. Its feathers were ruffled as if it felt cold and miserable, and\r\nits drooping head told a tale of unhappiness from some cause or other.\r\nWhilst I was watching it, a little bird darted with all its force\r\nagainst the larger one, and made it roll over on the path; it slowly\r\nrose up again, but in another minute a bird from the other side flew\r\nagainst it and again rolled it over. Such conduct could not be\r\ntolerated, so, dressing quickly, I went out, and picking up the strange\r\nbird I found it was a young cuckoo nearly starved to death, having, as I\r\nsupposed, lost its foster-parents. The bird was in beautiful plumage,\r\nexcept down the front of its throat, where the repeated attacks of the\r\nsmall birds in showing their usual enmity towards the cuckoo, had\r\nstripped off the feathers. The poor bird was only skin and bone, nearly\r\ndying from lack of food and persecution, and made no resistance when I\r\nbrought him in to see if I could act the part of foster-mother.\r\nFinely-mixed raw meat and brown bread seemed to me the best substitute\r\nfor his insect diet--but he _was_ an awkward baby to feed--though\r\nsinking for want of nourishment he would not open his great beak, and\r\nevery half-hour he had to be fed sorely against his will with many\r\nflapping of his wings and other protests of his bird nature. He would\r\nnot stay quiet in any sort of cage, but when allowed to perch on the rim\r\nof a large basket quite free, he remained happily enough by the hour\r\ntogether. After a few days he grew into a vigorous, active bird, flying\r\nround the room, and too wild to be retained with safety He was\r\ntherefore let loose, and soon flew quite out of sight. I should hope he\r\nwas quite able to support himself by his own exertions. I must say he\r\nshowed no gratitude for my benevolent succour in his time of need.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG CUCKOO ATTACKED BY BIRDS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE TAMING OF OUR PETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the love of animal and bird pets seems so universal, both amongst\r\nrich and poor, it is well that the desire to keep creatures in captivity\r\nshould be wisely directed, and that young people especially should be\r\nled to think of the things that are requisite to make their pets live\r\nand prosper in some degree of happiness.\r\n\r\nI have often been consulted by some sweet, impulsive child about its\r\n\"pet robin\" or \"dear little swallow,\" as to why it did not seem to eat\r\nor feel happy? and have found the poor victims quietly starving to\r\ndeath on a diet of oats, canary seed, or even green leaves, the infant\r\nmind not feeling quite sure what the \"pretty birdies\" lived upon.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say we might as well try to keep a bird on pebbles as\r\ngive hard grain to a soft-billed insect-eating bird; but this kind of\r\ncruelty is constantly practised simply from ignorance. I would therefore\r\nendeavour to give a few general rules for the guidance of those who have\r\na new pet of some kind, which they wish to domesticate and tame.\r\n\r\nTo begin with animals; suitable food, a comfortable home, means of\r\ncleanliness, and exercise are essential to their health and comfort.\r\nThese four requisites are seldom fully attended to. Often a large dog is\r\nkept in a back yard in London chained up week after week--kept alive, it\r\nis true, by food and water, but without exercise, and with no means of\r\nridding himself of dirt and insects by a plunge now and then into a pond\r\nor river. No wonder his piteous howls disturb the neighbours, and he is\r\nspoken of as \"that horrid dog!\" as if it was his fault poor fellow! that\r\nhe feels miserable and uses his only language of complaint.\r\n\r\nOne would suggest, it is better not to keep such a dog in a confined\r\nspace in town, but if he is to be retained he should have one or two\r\ndaily scampers for exercise, the opportunity of bathing, if he is a\r\nwater-dog, plenty of fresh water, dog-biscuits, and a few bones twice a\r\nday, and a clean house and straw for bedding.\r\n\r\nI would call attention to the piece of solid brimstone so persistently\r\nput into dogs' water pans. It is placed there with the best intention,\r\nbut is utterly useless, seeing it is a perfectly insoluble substance,\r\nbut a small teaspoonful of powdered brimstone mixed now and then with\r\nthe water would be lapped up when the animal drinks, and would tend to\r\nkeep his skin and coat in good condition.\r\n\r\nDifferent animals need treating according to their nature and\r\nrequirements, and surely it is well to try and find out from some of the\r\nmany charming books on natural history all the information which is\r\nneeded to make the new pet happy in its captivity. It is both useless\r\nand cruel to try to keep and tame newly caught, full-grown English\r\nbirds. After being used to their joyous life amongst tree branches, in\r\nhappy fellowship with others of their own kind, living on food of their\r\nown selection, it is hardly likely they can be reconciled to the narrow\r\nlimits of a cage and the dreariness of a solitary life; it is far better\r\nnot to attempt keeping them, for what pleasure can there be in seeing\r\nthe incessant flutterings of a miserable little creature that we know is\r\nbreaking its heart in longings for liberty, and though it may linger a\r\nwhile is sure to die at last of starvation and sorrow. No, the only way\r\nto enjoy friendships with full-grown birds is to tame them by food and\r\nkindness, till such a tie of love is formed that they will come into our\r\nhouses and give us their sweet company willingly.\r\n\r\nNo cruelty of any kind whatever should be tolerated for a moment in our\r\ntreatment of the tender dumb creatures our Heavenly Father has given us\r\nto be a solace and joy during our life on earth.\r\n\r\nThe taming of pets requires a good many different qualities--much\r\npatience, a very quiet manner, and a cheery way of talking to the little\r\ncreatures we desire to win into friendship with us; it is wonderful how\r\nthat prevents needless terrors.\r\n\r\nThere are no secrets that I am aware of in taming anything, but love and\r\ngentleness. Directly a bird flutters, one must stop and speak kindly;\r\nthe human voice has wonderful power over all animated nature, and then\r\ntry to see what is the cause of alarm, and remove it if possible. In\r\nentering a room where your pet is, always speak to it, and by the time\r\nyou have led it to give an answering chirp, the taming will go on\r\nrapidly, because there is an understanding between you, and the little\r\nlonely bird feels it has a friend, and takes you instead of its\r\nfeathered companions, and begins to delight in your company.\r\n\r\nA person going silently to a cage and dragging out the bottom tray will\r\nfrighten any bird into flutterings of alarm, which effectually hinders\r\nany taming going on; but approach gently, talking to the bird by name,\r\npull the tray quietly a little way, and then stop and speak, and so draw\r\nit out by degrees and the thing is done, and no fright experienced. A\r\nbetter way still is to have a second cage, and let birdie hop into that\r\nwhile you clean the other, and then it is amusing to see the pleasure\r\nand curiosity shown on his return when he finds fresh seed, pure water,\r\nand some dainty green food supplied; the loud chirpings tell of great\r\ndelight and satisfaction, and the dreaded process is at last looked\r\nforward to as a time of recreation. It is much best that one person only\r\nshould attend to the needs of a pet; indeed, I doubt if taming can ever\r\ngo on satisfactorily unless this rule is observed; a bird is perplexed\r\nand scared if plans are changed, and, not knowing what is required of\r\nhim, he grows flurried, and the training of weeks past may be undone in\r\na single day.\r\n\r\nOnly those who have tried to educate birds can have any idea of the way\r\nin which their little minds will respond to affectionate treatment shown\r\nin a sensible way. They have a language of their own which we must set\r\nourselves to learn if we would be _en rapport_ with them. Their\r\ndifferent chirpings each mean something, and a little observation will\r\nsoon show what it is; for instance, my canary fairly shrieks when she\r\nsees lettuce on the breakfast-table, and her grateful note of thanks\r\nwhen it is bestowed upon her is of quite a different character. So also\r\nis her tender little sound of rejoicing when I give her some broken\r\negg-shell; she seems to value it immensely, and chirps to me with a\r\ngreat piece of it in her bill, quite regardless of good manners. I often\r\nthink with pain how much birds must suffer when hour after hour they\r\ncall and chirp and entreat for something they want, which they can see\r\nand long for, and yet the dull-minded human beings they live with pay no\r\nheed to them, food and water are given, but, in many cases, nothing more\r\nall day long, not even a little chickweed or groundsel, or the\r\nmuch-needed egg-shell to supply strength to their little bones. A bright\r\nword or two for birdie now and then, and a few friendly chirps as we\r\nenter the room, would do much to cheer the little prisoner's life, and\r\nwould soon bring a charming response in fluttering wings and evident\r\npleasure at our return.\r\n\r\nThis state of things cannot be attained in a day or a month; it is only\r\nby persistent kindness, exercised patiently, until the little heart is\r\nwon to a perfect trust in you as a true friend.\r\n\r\nBirds can easily be trained to come out for their daily bath, and then\r\ngo back to their cage of their own accord, but it needs patience at\r\nfirst. The bird must never be caught by the hand or driven about, but if\r\nthe cage is put on the floor with some nice food in it, and the bird is\r\ncalled and gently guided to it, though it may take an hour to do it the\r\nfirst time, it will at last hop in, and then the door may be very\r\nquietly shut. Next time he will know what you wish and will be much more\r\namenable, until at last it will be the regular thing to go home when the\r\nbath is over.\r\n\r\nI would condemn the practice of making birds draw up their own water;\r\nthey are never free to satisfy their thirst without toilsome effort, and\r\nare much more liable to accident when chained to an open board than when\r\nkept in a cage. It is also sad to know that dozens of birds are starved\r\nto death or die of thirst whilst being taught this trick--frequently but\r\none out of many is found to have the aptitude to learn it.\r\n\r\nIt is a great help if some specially favourite food can be discovered by\r\nwhich the pet creature can be rewarded for good conduct. I _never_ take\r\naway food or water to induce obedience by privation--a practice which I\r\nfear is often resorted to in training creatures for public\r\nexhibition--but an additional dainty I much enjoy to bestow, as a means\r\nof winning what is at first, it is true, merely cupboard love, but it\r\nsoon grows into something far deeper, a lifelong friendship, quite apart\r\nfrom the food question.\r\n\r\nCleanliness is a _very_ important item in a bird's happiness. Whilst\r\nkept in a cage with but little sand and an outside water-glass which\r\naffords no means of washing its feathers, a bird is apt to become\r\ninfested with insects; it is tormented by them day and night, and having\r\nno means of ridding itself of them, it grows thin and mopy, and at last\r\ndies a miserable death.\r\n\r\nThere should be a bath supplied daily, suited to the size of the bird,\r\nand so planned that the cage itself may not get wet, else it may give\r\nthe bird cramp to have to sit on a damp perch or floor. When its\r\nfeathers are dry, some insect powder may be carefully dusted under the\r\nbird's wings, at the back of his head, where parasites are especially\r\napt to congregate, and all over the body, only taking care that the\r\npowder may not get into the bird's eyes. The cage itself should be well\r\nwashed with carbolic soap and water, all the corners scrubbed with a\r\nsmall brush; and, when dry, it might be sponged with carbolic lotion\r\nover the wire-work to kill any insects which may yet remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBIRDIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst all the different birds which are kept in cages, either for\r\ntheir beauty or song, there is one which to my mind far excels all\r\nothers, not only in its vocal powers, which are remarkable, but for its\r\nvery unusual intelligence. I refer to the Virginian nightingale. It is a\r\nhandsome, crimson plumaged bird, rather smaller than a starling, not\r\nunfrequently seen in bird-sellers' collections, but seen there to the\r\nworst possible advantage, for, being extremely shy and sensitive, and\r\ntaking keen notice of everything around, the slightest voice or movement\r\nin the shop will make it flutter against the bars of its cage in an\r\nagony of fright, and it therefore looks a most unlikely bird to become\r\nan interesting pet; but I will try to show what may be done by gentle\r\nkindness to overcome this natural timidity. This will be seen in the\r\nhistory of Birdie, my first Virginian nightingale, my daily companion\r\nfor fourteen years.\r\n\r\nHe had belonged to a relative, and there was no way of tracing the age\r\nof the bird when first obtained; I can therefore only speak of those\r\nyears in which he was in my possession. Birdie had been accustomed to\r\nlive in a cage on a high shelf in the kitchen, well cared for, no doubt,\r\nbut, untamed and unnoticed, he led a lonely life, and was one of the\r\nwildest birds I ever met with. For many months his flutterings, when any\r\none came near his cage, could not be calmed, but by always speaking to\r\nhim when entering the room, and if possible giving him a few hemp-seeds\r\nor any little dainty, he grew to endure one's presence; then, later on,\r\nhe would begin to greet one with a little clicking note, though still\r\nretreating to the furthest corner of the cage, and a year or two passed\r\nby before he would take anything out of my hand, but this was attained\r\nby offering him his one irresistible temptation, _i.e._, a lively\r\nspider; this he would seize and hold in his beak while he hopped about\r\nthe cage, clicking loudly with delight. After a time I began to let him\r\nout for an hour or two, first releasing him when he was moulting and\r\ncould not fly very easily. He learned to go back to his cage of his own\r\naccord, and was rewarded by always finding some favourite morsel there.\r\nThus, by slow degrees, he lost all fear, and attached himself to me with\r\na strength of affection that expressed itself in many endearing little\r\nways. When called by name he would always answer with a special chirp\r\nand look up expectantly, either to receive something or to be let out.\r\nHis song was very similar to the English nightingale, extremely liquid\r\nand melodious, with the same \"jug-jug,\" but more powerful and sustained.\r\nOn my return to the room after a short absence he would greet me with\r\ndelight, fluttering his outspread wings and singing his sweetest song,\r\nlooking intently at me, swaying his head from side to side, and whilst\r\nthis ecstasy of song lasted he would even refuse to notice his most\r\nfavourite food, as if he must express his joy before appetite could be\r\ngratified. After a few years he seemed to adopt me as a kind of mate!\r\nfor as spring came round he endeavoured to construct a nest by stealing\r\nlittle twigs out of the grate and flying with them to a chosen retreat\r\nbehind an ornamental scroll at the top of the looking-glass. He spent a\r\ngreat deal of time fussing about this nest, which never came to\r\nanything, but he very obligingly attended to my supposed wants by\r\npicking up an occasional fly, or piece of sugar, and, hovering before me\r\non the wing, would endeavour to put it into my mouth; or, if he was in\r\nhis cage, would mince up a spider or caterpillar with water, and then,\r\nwith his beak full of the delicious compound, would call and chirp\r\nunceasingly until I came near and \"made believe\" to taste it, and not\r\ntill then would he be content to enjoy it himself.\r\n\r\nDuring an absence from home, Birdie once escaped out of doors, and was\r\nseen on the roof of the house singing in high glee; the servants called\r\nhim, the cage was put out, but all to no purpose, he evidently meant to\r\nhave \"a real good time,\" and kept flying from one tree to another until\r\nhe was a quarter of a mile from home. A faithful servant kept him in\r\nsight for three hours, by which time hunger made him return to our\r\ngarden, where he feasted on some raspberries, took a leisurely bath in a\r\ntub of water, and at length flew in at a bedroom window, where he was\r\nsafely caged. I never knew a bird with so much intelligence, one might\r\nalmost say reasoning power. He was once very thirsty after being out of\r\nhis cage for many hours, and at luncheon he went to an empty silver\r\nspoon and time after time pretended to drink, looking fixedly at me as\r\nif he felt sure I should know what he meant, and waited quietly until I\r\nput water into the spoon. Another curious trait was his sense of humour.\r\nWhilst I was writing one day he went up to a rose, which was at the far\r\nend of the table, and began pecking at the leaves. I told him not to do\r\nit, when, to my surprise, he immediately ran the whole length of the\r\ntable and made a scolding noise up in my face, and then, just like a\r\nnaughty child, went back and did it again. He would sometimes try to\r\ntease me away from my writing by taking hold of my pen and tugging at a\r\ncorner of the paper, and whenever the terrible operation of cutting his\r\nclaws had to be gone through, he quietly curled up his toes and held the\r\nscissors with his beak, so that it needed two people to circumvent his\r\nclever resistance. He had wonderfully acute vision, and would let me\r\nknow directly a hawk was in sight, though it might be but the merest\r\nspeck in the sky. He once had a narrow escape, for a sparrow-hawk made a\r\nswoop at him in his cage just outside the drawing-room window, and had\r\nno one been at hand would probably have dragged him through the bars.\r\nWhenever he saw a jay or magpie, a jackdaw or cat, his clicking note\r\nalways told me of some enemy in sight. For many years Birdie was my\r\ncherished pet, never was there a closer friendship. As I passed his cage\r\neach night I put my hand in to stroke his feathers, and was always\r\ngreeted with a low, murmuring note of affection never heard in the\r\ndaytime.\r\n\r\nIt was with deep concern that I watched Birdie's declining strength;\r\nthere was no disease, only weakness, and at last appetite failed, but\r\neven then he would take whatever I offered him and hold it in his beak\r\nas if to show that even to the last he would try to please me as far as\r\nhe could, but he wanted nothing but the quiet rest which came at length,\r\nand dear little Birdie is now only a cherished memory of true\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZOeE, THE NUTHATCH.]\r\n\r\nZOeE, THE NUTHATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nA visit to a bird-dealer's shop always awakens a deep feeling of pity in\r\nmy mind as I look at the unhappy, flutter-little captives, and think of\r\nthe breezy hill-sides and pleasant lanes from which they came, to be\r\nshut up in cages a few inches square, with but little light, a stifling\r\natmosphere, strange diet, and no means of washing their ruffled feathers\r\nor stretching their wings in flight. Truly, they are in evil case, and\r\nno wonder so many die off within a few days of their capture! In some\r\nplaces they are better cared for than in others, but in most bird-shops\r\ndirt and misery seem to prevail amongst the tenants of the cages.\r\n\r\nOne such place I have often visited for the sake of meeting with live\r\ncurios. The owner was a kind-hearted woman, and did not intentionally\r\nill-treat her live-stock; but the shop was very dark and dirty, and one\r\ncould but wonder how anything contrived to live in such close, stivy\r\nair. On going in one day, I nearly walked over a large, pensive-looking\r\nduckling which stood in the middle of the shop. His brother had been\r\nconsidered suitable for the adornment of a table-lamp with a\r\nlooking-glass stand, on which a bright yellow duckling was placed, as if\r\nswimming on water; this bird, having some darker markings, was of no use\r\nfor that purpose and had been allowed to live. He had a strange,\r\nold-fashioned look, and gave one the impression that he was already\r\ntired of life and felt bored. A lark on its little piece of turf,\r\nfluttering and looking up for a glimpse of blue sky; a dejected robin,\r\nwith no tail to speak of, and sundry other sad-looking specimens met my\r\npitying gaze, and I suppose I had caught their sorrowful expression,\r\nfor I was startled by a sharp voice near me, saying, \"What's the\r\nmatter?\" I turned to reply, and found the inquiry was made by a grey\r\nparrot, who introduced himself as \"Pretty Poll,\" and was ready to make\r\nfriends to any extent. But my attention had been caught by seeing what\r\nlooked like a nuthatch: only it was moping and ill, with eyes shut and\r\nfeathers ruffled. I asked about it, and was told it had some injury to\r\nits foot, and was unsaleable, as the woman feared it would not live. I\r\nmade a bid for it, and it was accepted. I confess I was not sorry to\r\nleave the stilling air of the shop and bring my new pet home. I fitted\r\nup a large cage with pieces of wood and tree-bark, a pan for bathing,\r\nsand, and fine gravel; a bone with a little meat upon it hung from the\r\nroof of the cage, and other suitable food was placed in a tin. The poor\r\nbirdie was a pitiable object for some days; she ate now and then, but\r\nremained for the most part quite still, with closed eyes, from morning\r\ntill night. Then she began to creep up and down the small tree-stem I\r\nhad placed in the cage. She took a bath and plumed herself, and in less\r\nthan a fortnight she became quite well and vigorous, and very amusing\r\nin a variety of ways. Never was there a more active, busy little\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nHer characteristic was life, so she was named \"Zoee,\" and before long she\r\nseemed to recognize her name, and would give an answering chirp. The\r\npieces of bark appeared to afford a never-failing interest. They were\r\nexamined and investigated in every crevice. Like a little woodpecker\r\nhanging head downwards, Zoee would hammer at a nut fixed in the cracks of\r\nthe bark, and would hide away unfortunate mealworms not required for\r\nimmediate use.\r\n\r\nZoee regularly honeycombed the little tree-stem with her incessant\r\nhammering, and in the numerous holes thus made she kept her supply of\r\nfood. No sooner was her tin filled with small pieces of raw meat than\r\nshe began stowing them all away for future use. She seemed to exercise a\r\ngood deal of thought about the matter; a morsel would be put in and out\r\nof a hole half a dozen times before it was considered settled and\r\nsuitable, and then it had to be well rammed in and fixed, and off went\r\nthe busy little creature to fetch another piece, and so on, till all\r\nwas disposed of, and the tin left empty. Zoee was greatly exercised by a\r\nhalf-opened Brazil nut: it was too large to fix into the bark, it would\r\nnot keep steady while she pecked at it, and yet there were good things\r\ninside which must be obtained. I watched her various devices with great\r\namusement. She hung head downwards from the tree-stem and hammered at it\r\non the ground, but it shifted about, and she made no way; then she\r\ncarried it in her beak and tried fitting it into various places. I hope\r\nshe did not swear at it, but she seemed to think the thing was\r\npossessed, for it was not like the ordinary nuts: she could manage them;\r\nthey would go into holes in the bark; this wouldn't fit anywhere, and\r\nyet she could not give it up. At last, by a bright inspiration, she got\r\nit fixed into a space between the tree-stem and the side of the cage.\r\nNow she was in high glee, and all the household might have heard the\r\nrapping that went on while she scooped out the inside and chipped off\r\npieces to be hidden carefully away in some secret place.\r\n\r\nZoee had a cosy nook under a sloping piece of bark, to which she would\r\nretire at times, and sitting down on the bottom of her cage in the\r\nshadow, looked like a little grey mouse. When appetite brought her out\r\nagain, she would go to her tree-larder and pick out the choice hidden\r\nmorsels, as if they were the insects which would have been her food if\r\nher lot had been cast amongst tree-branches instead of in a cage.\r\n\r\nWhen winter began, Zoee was placed in the conservatory, where a tame\r\nrobin often came for a few hours to enjoy his daily crumbs and the\r\npleasant warmth of the air. Bobby was greatly puzzled at the nuthatch,\r\nwatched her hammerings from the top of the cage, walked round it,\r\nsurveying the provisions inside, and at last he made up his mind to get\r\nin somehow and partake of the longed-for dainties. I could see quite\r\nplainly the attraction, the hesitation, the pros and cons, and then,\r\nfinally, the resolve, and felt very curious as to how the birdish mind\r\nwould carry out its intention. There was only one place, where the bars\r\nwere rather widely apart, so that the nuthatch could have got out if she\r\nhad possessed half the wits of the robin. After a quiet survey and a few\r\nflights backwards and forwards, Bobby saw this place, and made towards\r\nit, sat and considered for a few seconds, and finally went in. The\r\nnuthatch was sitting quietly under her piece of bark, and did not see\r\nhim; so he picked up the desired morsels, and, after a few minutes, went\r\nout where it came in. These visits he repeated frequently through the\r\nday, but once I was amused to see that he forgot \"the way out,\" and put\r\nhimself in a great fuss, realized that a cage was a prison, and flew up\r\nand down in a fright, until by chance he saw the opening, and glided\r\nout. At last Zoee caught him in the act of purloining her goodies, and\r\nwas most indignant. A rush at the thief, with an angry chirp, sent Bobby\r\nflying away in ignominious haste, a wiser, but not a repentant bird; for\r\nhe continued his robberies, only with care to avoid being caught; he\r\nventured only a little way into the cage, ready to go out at a moment's\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nZoee had a good deal of quiet humour, and was a character in her way. She\r\nconsidered me very attentively one day, with a roguish look in her black\r\neyes, and then, going to her tree-stem larder, she pulled out a hidden\r\nmealworm and held it up for me to see, with an evident wish that I\r\nshould know about it, and possibly with a little birdish triumph that\r\nshe possessed such delights; and then it was put back again and well\r\nrammed into its crevice until the hungry moment should arrive. After a\r\nfew months Zoee became tame enough to be let out of her cage, and would\r\nhop quietly about the room, and, like a small, grey-coated detective,\r\nwould peer about stealthily under tables and chairs in search of live\r\ndainties; and extremely pretty she looked as she crept up the curtains\r\nwith jerky motions, evidently thinking they were tree-stems where, by\r\ncareful search, delightful centipedes and beetles might be found.\r\n\r\nI do not know if naturalists have remarked that the nuthatch has a very\r\nlimited range of vision. Zoee could see nothing beyond twelve or fourteen\r\ninches; the most tempting mealworm might lie on the floor of the cage\r\nunnoticed if she happened to be on her tree-stem; and I have tried\r\nbringing the insect nearer by degrees, and found that only when within a\r\nfoot of her eyes could she see it, and I fancy then only indistinctly\r\nas she would peer about excitedly, as if uncertain what it was, until\r\nnear enough to be in the focus of clear vision, and then, by a sudden\r\ndart, she would seize and flit away with it.\r\n\r\nAt first Zoee's roosting-place was under the curved piece of bark lying\r\non the floor of her cage, but after a time she took up her nightly\r\nquarters in a small box which hooked on to the side of her cage. It was\r\na very cramped and uncomfortable lodging, and I wondered how she\r\ncontrived to squeeze into such a small space. It occurred to me that a\r\nlittle cocoa-nut with a hole at one end would be the sort of\r\nsleeping-chamber she would prefer, as being most like a hole in a\r\ntree-stem, in which, probably, nuthatches roost.\r\n\r\nAn empty cocoa-nut was, therefore, provided. With birdish distrust and\r\ncaution Zoee only eyed it for some days, then perched on it; but finally\r\nshe went in, and it was amusing to see her evident delight: how she went\r\nincessantly in and out, and turned round and round inside, and finally\r\nsat down and remained in it for an hour or more, quite still and happy,\r\npeering out at any one passing by, her sleek head and neck looking\r\nremarkably like a snake, and her furtive black eye observantly watching\r\nall that went on around her.\r\n\r\nHer cage, when not in the conservatory, was placed on a table in the\r\ndrawing-room, close to where I was sitting, and thus she was frequently\r\nspoken to and noticed, which is one great secret in taming birds and\r\nanimals. They soon learn to greet one with some token of recognition,\r\nand their often solitary lives are brightened and cheered by such\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\nAn amusing thing occurred one day while I was away from home for a few\r\nhours. Zoee's cage had been placed in the sun, and a friend of mine,\r\nglancing at the bird, saw her in an apparently dying state, her head\r\nhanging on one side, the beak wide open, all the feathers ruffled, and\r\nthe whole aspect of the bird indicating the near approach of death. The\r\nbell was rung, the servants came in, and whispered consultations were\r\nheld as to what could be done, and \"What would mistress say?\" seemed the\r\nuppermost thought. All at once, Zoee jumped down and began a vigorous\r\nhammering at her tree-stem, as full of life as ever, and she was at once\r\nvoted \"a little impostor.\" When I returned and heard the account, it was\r\neasy to explain that my birdie had been enjoying a sun bath, which\r\nalways gives rise to most lackadaisical positions while the state of\r\ndreamy absorption lasts.\r\n\r\nThe mealworms which Zoee mainly lived upon were kept in a tin\r\nbiscuit-box, which she knew well by sight, and one day, being too busy\r\nto spare time to feed her with them, I opened her cage-door and put the\r\nbox down a little way from the cage on the floor, and placed a small log\r\nof wood for her to descend by. Down she came, perched on the edge of the\r\nbox, looked at the layers of flannel which covered her delightful worms,\r\nand tugged at one corner after another till she obtained her prey. After\r\nswallowing two or three, she thought a little store might be useful, and\r\nbegan taking them in her beak, and searching for some convenient\r\nhiding-places, but as I did not desire to have the drawing-room neatly\r\nornamented with mealworms, I had to prevent that little design being\r\ncarried out. My tiny pet lived happily for about a year, but when the\r\nmoulting time came she grew weak and ill, and did not seem to have\r\nstrength to produce her new plumage; for, in spite of all possible care,\r\nshe drooped and died. She lives in my memory as one of the most gentle,\r\ninnocent birdies I have ever had, absolutely without temper, contented\r\nand cheerful, a perfect pattern of industry, chipping out holes in her\r\nlog of wood, and flitting about with a happy little chirp from morning\r\ntill night, a bright example of what a cheery life may be lived, even by\r\na caged bird, when kindly treated and cared for thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTITMICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must own my strong liking for these active, saucy little birds. For\r\neighteen years I have always had a basket hung just outside the\r\ndining-room window containing their favourite food, _.e._, fat of any\r\nkind, cooked or uncooked; and most amusing it is to watch their little\r\nodd ways and tempers whilst frequenting the said basket. Four species\r\nthus studied showed distinct characteristics. Directly I put out a fresh\r\nsupply of fat, the Cole Tit would spend all his time and energies in\r\ncarrying it away, piece by piece, to lay by in store for the future, in\r\ncrevices in the bark of trees, and this work he would carry on with\r\nmisplaced energy until the basket was emptied. The Greater Tit and Marsh\r\nTit came quietly for the supply of their own personal needs, and to feed\r\ntheir young in nesting time, but the Blue Tit was by far the most\r\namusing. His attitudes were quite a study; he seemed rather to prefer\r\nbeing upside down; clinging to the basket and hammering away at the hard\r\nfat, head downwards, was a favourite pose; then, when any one else\r\ndesired a share, he would make a stand with open beak and outspread\r\nwings and enact \"king of the castle\" in the most impertinent manner,\r\nconsidering his tiny dimensions. A guerilla warfare seems always going\r\non amongst these Blue Tits. If one was in the basket and remaining\r\nperfectly still, I knew two or three others were meditating a sudden\r\ncombined assault, but it seemed as if the steady gaze of the titmouse\r\nin possession kept them at bay for a time. At length a twittering\r\nscrimmage ensued, and the combatants disappeared. I once coaxed a Blue\r\nTit to live in the dining-room for a few days, and he made himself very\r\nhappy, constantly flitting about in search of insects, running up and\r\ndown the curtains like a veritable mouse, alighting on any joint of cold\r\nmeat which happened to be on the sideboard, and making an excellent\r\ndinner in Bohemian fashion. Of course his fearless curiosity led him\r\ninto difficulties. He would sit on the edge of a jug and peer down to\r\nsee what it might contain, and his plumage was not improved by the baths\r\nof milk or cocoa which he met with in the pursuit of knowledge of this\r\nkind. Some years ago an empty cocoa-husk with a hole at one end,\r\nfurnished with nesting materials, was hung up just above the basket of\r\nfat. A large tit began to build in it, but unhappily for him a Blue Tit\r\nhad also been house-hunting, and determined to settle in it. I saw the\r\nmatter decided by a pitched battle between the two; they fought\r\ndesperately, rolling over and over on the lawn, pecking, chirping,\r\nbeating each other with their wings, like little feathered furies as\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Titmice.]\r\n\r\nAt last it was ended, and Blue Tit was victor. It was pretty to see the\r\ntiny pair building their nest, with little happy twitterings and\r\nconfabulations over each piece of moss or dried leaf, and so fearless\r\nwere they that a large blind was often let down close to and over the\r\nhusk without disturbing the inmates. When the hen bird was sitting, the\r\ncock would bring a green caterpillar for her every four or five minutes,\r\nand sometimes take her place on the nest. I often took the husk down\r\nfrom its nail to show the brave little bird sitting on her eggs. If\r\ntouched she would hiss and set up her feathers, but did not leave her\r\nnest. When the young birds were hatched, the parents were incessantly at\r\nwork from early morning till late at night bringing small caterpillars\r\nabout every two minutes to supply the wants of the tiny brood. One can\r\njudge of the usefulness of these birds in ridding our gardens of insect\r\npests by the amount consumed by this one pair. By a moderate\r\ncalculation, and judging by what I saw one afternoon, I believe they\r\nmust have brought 3,570 in the course of one week. At last the day came\r\nwhen five little blue heads peeped out of the entrance to the husk. One\r\nafter another the little ones flew into branches near by; the last one I\r\nheld in my hand for a while that I might draw its portrait. Fearing it\r\nmight be hungry if I kept it too long, I placed it in a cage on the\r\nlawn, where the old birds found it and fed it for me through the bars. I\r\nthen brought it in again, and having finished its likeness, had the\r\npleasure of restoring it to its parents. The Blue and Cole Tit often\r\nchoose the inside of a disused pump as their nesting-place. A Cole Tit\r\nbuilt in an old pump in our grounds for many years, the curved spout\r\nbeing its mode of ingress and egress. I could open a small door and look\r\nat the pretty little hen on her nest, and then at her numerous family,\r\nand watch their growth till old enough to fly. Certainly young birds\r\nshow a grand lesson of obedience, for creeping out into the world\r\nthrough a dark, curved pipe, must have seemed a rather perilous mode of\r\nexit. Another less fortunate Cole Tit built in a post-box placed by a\r\ngarden gate, and seemed in no way disconcerted when letters came in\r\nsuddenly around and upon her. She usually laid eighteen eggs in a deep,\r\nsoft nest of moss and hair. As boys were apt to take this nest year\r\nafter year, a lock was placed to the box to protect the little bird; but\r\nthe genus boy has no pity, and through the slit for the letters, some\r\ncruel urchin, vexed at not being able to take the nest, put in a stick\r\nand killed the poor little mother and broke the eggs. For several years\r\na Blue Tit chose to build her nest in the lower part of a stone vase in\r\nthe garden. There was a hole for drainage in the bottom, and through\r\nthis hole the little bird found a circular space just suited for her\r\nnest. That particular vase could not be filled with plants till long\r\nafter all the rest were gay with flowers. We were obliged to wait till\r\nthe domestic affairs of the Tit family were ended, else their fate would\r\nhave been sad indeed. There is no doubt that these birds do contrive to\r\nsecure their share of peas and other things in the kitchen garden, and\r\nare by no means favourites with the gardeners, but I still maintain that\r\nthe good they do in destroying insects counterbalances their evil doings\r\nin other respects. However, they sometimes commit other misdemeanours.\r\nMy head gardener came to me one day looking very serious, and began by\r\nasking what he was to do about \"those Blue Tits.\" \"Why, what have they\r\nbeen doing?\" I asked. \"Two of them have been sitting at the entrance of\r\none of the hives, and they have picked off and killed every bee as it\r\ncame out, and now they have begun upon a second hive.\" \"Well, you had\r\nbetter hang up some potatoes stuck over with feathers, and that will\r\nfrighten them away.\" \"I've done that, ma'am, and they sit on the\r\npotatoes and look at me!\" It was a trying case of utter contumacy, and\r\nat last I was obliged, for the sake of saving my bees, to let one little\r\nvictim be shot and hung up as \"an awful example\" to the rest, and it\r\nproved an effectual remedy. My basket of fat used to prove very\r\nattractive all through the cold weather, when, I suppose, these tiny\r\nbirds need the caloric it supplies; they always left off coming as soon\r\nas the days were warm and insects plentiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBLANCHE, THE PIGEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPigeons possess a great deal more individuality of character than any\r\none would suppose who has only seen them in flocks picking up grain in a\r\nfarmyard, like domestic fowls.\r\n\r\nThey show to better advantage when only a few pairs are kept and fed\r\ndaily at some settled place; but to make really interesting pets two are\r\nquite sufficient, and may be made very amusing companions. Some species\r\nmay possess more mental capacity than others. Those I have to speak of\r\nwere snow-white trumpeters. A pair was sent to me, but, to my sorrow, I\r\nfound on opening the basket that the male bird had escaped on the way;\r\nso I could only put the solitary hen in a cage, and do all that was\r\npossible in the way of plentiful food and kind care to make her happy;\r\nbut all to no purpose. The poor bird pined and grew weaker every day,\r\ntill she became unable to get up to her perch. I used, therefore, to go\r\nto her every evening and place her comfortably for the night; and she\r\nsoon grew tame enough to like being caressed and talked to. When spring\r\nreturned I obtained a male pigeon, and hoped Blanche would accept him\r\nfor a mate, but she showed a great deal of temper, and made him so\r\nunhappy that he had to be exchanged for another--a fine snow-white bird\r\nlike herself, and, happily, of such a forbearing disposition as to\r\nendure being considerably \"hen-pecked.\" Now began the curious part of\r\nBlanche's history. The pair built a nest in a small pigeon-house close\r\nto my window, so that I was able to watch all the family arrangements\r\nwith much interest. Blanche liked to be with me for some hours in the\r\nmorning, sitting on the table pluming herself, quite at ease, and when\r\nthat operation was ended she generally seated herself on a large Bible\r\nwhich lay at one end of the dining-table, and there she usually went to\r\nsleep; a white dove resting on the Word suggested to one's mind many a\r\nbeautiful emblematic thought. These visits to me were paid most\r\nregularly when a nest was finished and the eggs were being hatched; she\r\nthen shared the duties of incubation by turns with her mate. He would\r\nsit patiently for four hours on the nest, while Blanche spent that time\r\nwith me; then, punctually at the right moment, she would wake up, and,\r\nlazily stretching her wings, would fly out at the open window to see how\r\naffairs were getting on at home, and take her place on the nest for her\r\nappointed four hours.\r\n\r\nShe was a most eccentric bird in the matter of laying eggs. I sometimes\r\nfound she had made me a present of one, neatly placed amongst my working\r\nmaterials! In fact, wherever she happened to be upon the table would be\r\ndeemed by her a suitable place for laying; and, as I always conveyed the\r\neggs to her nest, her little freaks did not much matter. But at last\r\nshe took it into her wilful little head to lay her eggs in the\r\ncoal-scoop, an arrangement which by no means improved her snowy plumage.\r\nShe had a pretty crest, which curved over her head, and her feet were\r\nclothed with rather long feathers reaching to the claws. At our\r\nbreakfast-time she would often sit close to my plate, letting me stroke\r\nher and draw out her pretty wings. I must own she was as conceited as\r\nany peacock, throwing herself on her side and stretching out a feathered\r\nfoot, little dreaming how she was being laughed at for her affected\r\nattitudes. If she had a fault, it was her temper! I have seen her go up\r\nto her mate and give him a most uncalled-for peck, and he--amiable\r\nbird!--would bear all her unkindness so meekly, only answering by a\r\npropitiatory coo. Blanche reared many sons and daughters, but none were\r\nso interesting as herself. I ascribe her unusual tameness to the loving\r\ncare bestowed upon her in her long illness. When once a bird's\r\naffections are won in that way they generally remain firm friends for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGERBILLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese curious little animals were brought to my notice by a scientific\r\nfriend who had seen them at the Zoological Gardens, and heard that they\r\nwere to be obtained there by applying to Mr. Bartlett.\r\n\r\nAs I always regretted the untimely death of my pet jerboa, I thought\r\nthese little rodents would fill his place, and prove amusing pets. And,\r\naccordingly, I paid a visit to the Zoo, and found a whole colony of\r\ngerbilles of all ages living very amicably together in a large,\r\nstrongly-built wooden box, with bran, oats, and nuts for provender.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to secure a pair of suitable size and age. I could\r\nbut admire the patience of the attendant who made persevering attempts\r\nto catch the nimble creatures for me, but they leaped and sprang about,\r\ndarted through his fingers, disappeared into holes, and seemed to enjoy\r\nhis discomfiture. At length a lively pair, with sleek skins and perfect\r\ntails, were securely caged.\r\n\r\nThen I was warned to keep them in a tin-lined cage, as they would \"gnaw\r\nthrough anything,\" even the solid teak chest in which they were kept was\r\nbeing rapidly demolished by their powerful incisors.\r\n\r\nThe gerbilles were placed in a plant case, four feet long, with glass\r\nsides and top, through which their gambols could easily be seen. The\r\ncase had a glass partition, and on one side lived a pair of chipmunks,\r\nor striped American squirrels. They were highly incensed at their new\r\nneighbours, springing with all their force against the partition, with\r\nlow growlings, casting up the cocoa fibre with their hind legs, as if to\r\ntry and hide them from their view. They soon found a little chink,\r\nthrough which, I am afraid, some very strong language was launched at\r\nthe new-comers.\r\n\r\nHappily the gerbilles did not mind. They found delightful tree-roots to\r\ngnaw at, plenty of food, and freedom to frisk and frolic to their\r\nheart's content, so their neighbours were free to growl as much as they\r\nliked, and they in their turn raised a hill of fibre and played at\r\nhide-and-seek in their new domain.\r\n\r\nBut let me now describe these gerbilles. I believe there are several\r\nspecies, differing somewhat in appearance. These were fawn-coloured,\r\nwith sleek, soft fur, which, like the chinchilla, was blueish next to\r\nthe skin. They were about the size of small rats, with little ears and\r\nlong tails, with a black tuft at the end. The fur was white underneath,\r\nthe eyes jet black and very large, and long black whiskers, which were\r\nalways in motion. The hind legs being longer than the front ones,\r\nenabled the creature to spring and leap along the ground with great\r\nrapidity, as I found to my cost one night, when five of them got out of\r\ntheir case and gave us an hour's occupation before they could be\r\nrecaptured. One managed to get inside an American organ, and effectually\r\nbaffled all our efforts to secure him. There was no help for it, he had\r\nto be left there, and I went away with an anxious mind as to what his\r\nbusy teeth would be employed upon all night; and, sure enough, next\r\nmorning a velvet curtain was found nibbled and tattered, and being\r\nconverted into a nest for the enterprising gerbille! They became very\r\namusing, tame little creatures, ready to take dandelions, nuts, or any\r\nlittle dainty, from one's hand.\r\n\r\nAs they breed very readily in England, I was soon presented with a\r\nlittle family of five very tiny, pinkish-coloured infants, quite blind,\r\nand destitute of hair. They were not attractive, and so were left to\r\ntheir mother's care till they could see and were properly clothed, and\r\nthen they were extremely pretty, and rapidly developed all the habits\r\nand manners of their parents, gnawing wood, nibbling nuts, and having\r\nmerry games of their own, darting with wonderful quickness in and out of\r\nthe tree-roots, and getting up small battles for some coveted morsel of\r\ndiet. The first pair were quiet enough, and agreed happily together, but\r\nwhen, later on, mother and daughter happened to have a little brood at\r\nthe same time, things became complicated, and it was no uncommon sight\r\nto see the two mothers careering about, each with an infant in its\r\nmouth, and it often fell to my lot to take care of the unfortunate\r\nchildren and replace them in the nest whilst the mothers had a\r\n\"stand-up\" fight, and this is a literally true expression, for gerbilles\r\nsit bolt upright and fight each other with their front feet; but, though\r\nthey appear to be in desperate conflict, I must say I never saw that any\r\ndamage was done. As to their gnawing power, it is almost beyond\r\ndescription. I gave them a strong wooden box as a nursery for the young\r\ngerbilles, but before long they had eaten out the back and sides, and a\r\nmere skeleton of a box remained. There was a piece of zinc, which formed\r\na partition, but they ate a hole right through the zinc in no time, and\r\nwhen a wire cage, with a sliding door, was placed in the plant case,\r\nthey soon learnt how to lift up the door and get out. We often watched\r\nthe formation of the family nest, which was constructed of wool and hay\r\nnibbled very small, and carried by mouthfuls and woven together. It\r\ngenerally had two outlets for ingress and egress. There the entire\r\nfamily would sleep during the day amicably enough, but towards evening\r\nthe nursery disputes would begin, and old animosities led to frequent\r\nbattles and scrimmages, because somebody wanted some one else's pieces\r\nof wool for the precious infants. Still they were very tame, amusing\r\nlittle creatures, liking to be stroked and fed and rewarded by a run\r\nupon the breakfast-table, where they would examine every dish and plate\r\nin a delicate, inquiring way, not touching the contents--only trying to\r\nadd to their small amount of knowledge of the outside world. Their food\r\nconsisted of bran, oats, pea-nuts, wheat, fresh dandelion and\r\nclover-leaves, and on these they lived in perfect health and beauty.\r\n\r\nAs the colony increased, it was needful to make several homes for the\r\ngerbilles, and the original pair happened to be, for a time, in a cage\r\nupstairs on a landing. One of these found its way out of the cage, down\r\nthe stairs, across the hall, and was discovered next morning in a room\r\nwhere the younger members of the family were kept. This would go to\r\nprove a keen scent, which, I suppose, guided the little animal to find\r\nits friends, and also confirms what travellers have written about\r\ngerbilles living in large colonies and always keeping together.\r\n\r\nOne evening I had to read some natural history papers at a Band of Mercy\r\nmeeting in a neighbouring village, where the clergyman's wife took great\r\ninterest in promoting kindness to animals, and as I proposed speaking\r\nabout the gerbilles, I thought I would take some of them with me to show\r\nthe children. Accordingly a mother and four little ones, were put into a\r\ncage with some food and bedding for their comfort whilst being\r\nexhibited. I was concerned to see the extreme terror they seemed to feel\r\nat the unusual motion of the carriage, and in a few minutes one became\r\nconvulsed and literally died of fright. I held the cage in my lap, and\r\ntalked to the others to reassure them, fearing more casualties, but\r\nafter a while they settled down, and we reached the schoolroom in due\r\ntime. I was scarcely prepared for the tremendous sensation the gerbilles\r\ncreated. Remarks in broad Hertfordshire greeted their appearance. \"Whoy,\r\nhere's a lot of moise.\" \"Noa, they ain't; they's rats!\" \"Will they\r\nboite?\" and then such a cluster of children came round me they had to be\r\ncalled to order, and the cage was carried round that all might see the\r\nlittle foreigners, and through all the after-proceedings many pairs of\r\neyes remained fixed upon the cage and its inmates. I fancy that evening\r\nwill long be remembered by the children.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty that attends the keeping of these little animals is\r\ntheir rapid rate of increase. It is true they can all be kept together,\r\nfor, as I have said, though there are squabbles they do not result in\r\nany personal injury, and thus my colony was allowed to go on till there\r\nwas no counting the number of generations that existed. I very much\r\nwished to reduce the numbers, and give some away, but could never tell\r\nwhich were the mothers of the small pink infants I was being presented\r\nwith continually. I tried putting a little family of the babies into a\r\ncage in the plant case, hoping the mother who belonged to them would\r\nthen appear and take care of them; but no, the entire colony trooped in\r\nand ran riot in the new place, and if a young gerbille was by chance\r\nleft uncovered in the _melee_, a twentieth cousin would take it up\r\ntenderly as if it was its own mother, and replace it in the nest--a very\r\nemblem of brotherly kindness and charity. The colony had finally to be\r\ndispersed and given away in small detachments to different friends, and,\r\nstrange to say, in no other case did the numbers increase, I imagine\r\nbecause the requisite conditions of space and quietness were not\r\nrealized as in the pleasant home I was able to provide for them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWATER SHREWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHearing that the little patients in a London hospital had scarcely any\r\ntoys, and that they especially desired a very large doll, I had one\r\ndressed for them, and various other interesting items, such as an album\r\nof pictures, bags of shells, a stamp snake, &c., were prepared; but a\r\nlarge box was needed in which to pack all these treasures; and one which\r\nhad been for months in the wine-cellar was brought up for that purpose\r\ninto the hall.\r\n\r\nIt was filled with straw, and as I was watching this being taken out I\r\nnoticed some small black animals darting about in it.\r\n\r\n\"They must be young rats,\" I exclaimed, \"and the rare kind, too--the\r\nblack rat, which has been almost entirely eradicated by the stronger\r\nbrown species.\" A curious instance, by the way, of a foreign interloper\r\ndriving out the native.\r\n\r\nI immediately resolved to secure these animals, whatever they might\r\nprove to be, and, armed with leather gloves, and an empty glass globe to\r\nplace my captures in, I began to search in the straw, and soon secured\r\nthe supposed rats, but they proved to be a pair of water shrews--jet\r\nblack, lively little creatures, with sharply-pointed snouts and teeth,\r\nas I soon discovered to my cost. I had taken off my gloves and was\r\nwatching the activity of the shrews, when suddenly they flew upon each\r\nother, biting and screaming with rage, and, thinking they would kill\r\neach other at that rate, I tried to separate them, but one turned and\r\nbit me pretty severely, and it was with some difficulty they were\r\nparted. One I put into a zinc fern case, and the other into a large\r\nempty aquarium, with shingle at the bottom, moss and wool for bedding,\r\nand a large pan of water for swimming and bathing.\r\n\r\nThey were rather larger than the common mouse, jet black above, and\r\ngreyish-white beneath--restless, active creatures, usually found near\r\nponds and ditches; and how ever these two had found their way into a dry\r\ncellar, and lived in a box of straw will always remain a mystery. I\r\nlearnt from books that they fed on worms and insects, and that diet was\r\nprovided, though much to my distress, for it is a miserable thing to see\r\nany living creature tortured and devoured alive, even though it may be\r\nin obedience to natural instincts. Happily I soon found a substitute. I\r\nwas showing one of the shrews to a fellow-student of natural history,\r\nand with a long feather soon attracted the little animal's attention; he\r\nalways came out of his bed and sprang upon the feather like a little\r\ntiger, dragging it about and holding on with the grip of a bull-dog, so\r\nthat one could lift him off the ground and keep him swinging a minute in\r\nthe air to see the pretty white fur underneath. My friend suggested that\r\nit probably fed on small birds and thought the feather was part of its\r\ndaily fare.\r\n\r\nI obtained a fowl's head from the larder, and then it was a sight to see\r\nhow it was pounced upon and dragged about until securely hidden under\r\nthe moss, when we could hear our little friend crunching the bones and\r\ntearing it to pieces as if he had not had anything so good for a long\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nOne shrew died in a few days, but the other lived three weeks in perfect\r\nhealth, and I believe it was an accidental failure of sufficient food\r\nthat led to the death of the second; their appetite seems to be, like\r\nthat of the mole, most voracious, and unless they obtain a constant and\r\nample supply of food they quickly die of hunger.\r\n\r\nThey are worth studying for a few days, but their dreadful odour and\r\nfierce character make them anything but pets. I suppose there is hardly\r\nany animal in England so fierce and combative, and probably that may\r\naccount for the fact that one so often comes across a dead shrew lying\r\non the path in summer.\r\n\r\nWhen swimming, the shrew's furry coat perfectly resisted the entrance of\r\nmoisture; it always came out absolutely dry. The said coat was most\r\ncarefully kept in order; a daily brushing and cleansing went on, the\r\nlittle tongue was often at work licking off every little speck of dust;\r\nthe toes were spread out and examined; the small amount of tail kept in\r\norder. I could but think how many a lesson we may learn from the small\r\nas well as the great creations of God's hand--habits such as this little\r\nanimal possessed might, in the way of cleanliness, lead to the\r\nprevention of endless diseases, if imitated by those who never dream of\r\ndaily cleansings as being necessary to health and life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SQUIRREL.]\r\n\r\nSQUIRRELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one lives in the country where these graceful little animals exist,\r\nit is well worth while to attract them near the house so that one may\r\nenjoy the sight their gambols and minister to their wants by suitable\r\ndiet. As I have already said, for many years food was placed in a basket\r\noutside the dining-room window to attract the charming little titmice,\r\nand four species might be seen feasting on fat of different kinds. I\r\nplaced Barcelona nuts for the nuthatches, and they came and shared the\r\ncontents of the basket with the tits. The nuts also drew a squirrel to\r\nthe spot, and after about a year, the little fellow became so used to\r\nseeing us moving in the room that he would sit in the basket with his\r\ngraceful little tail curved over his back, cracking his nuts, and\r\nnibbling away quite at ease. Then the window was opened and the nuts put\r\non a table inside the room, and there little \"Frolic\" sits whilst we are\r\nat meals and forms one of the family, holding his nuts cleverly in his\r\npaws, whilst his sharp teeth bite a hole in them, and, regardless of\r\ntidiness, he flings the shells about as he nibbles at the kernels,\r\nlooking at us with his black, beady eyes, perhaps speculating upon what\r\nour breakfast may be. How much more enjoyable is this sort of pet than a\r\npoor caged squirrel whirling round in his wheel, condemned to a dreary\r\nlife, with no freedom or change, no intercourse with his kind.\r\n\r\nIn town there is, perhaps, no way to keep a squirrel but in a cage; even\r\nso, by an occasional release from its captivity, a constant variety in\r\nits food, and its being talked to and noticed, its life may be made\r\nless irksome, and, if young, it may eventually be made quite tame, and\r\nbecome an interesting daily companion.\r\n\r\nWe derived great amusement from our squirrel visitors; one after another\r\nthey would leap up the side of the window and spring in and out of the\r\nbasket in quick succession, carrying away a nut at each visit, playing\r\nand skirmishing with each other in lively fashion. I am sorry to confess\r\nthere was great jealousy amongst them. A second squirrel took to coming\r\ninto the room, and Frolic and he had a pitched battle, in which our\r\nfavourite, poor little fellow! lost half his ear, and a sponge and water\r\nwere needed to efface the sanguinary stains left by the fight.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel's great enemy is the cat. One would not think she could\r\ncatch the agile little creature; but one day we saw a cat watching an\r\nunconscious little squirrel under the tulip-tree: we did not dream that\r\nshe could harm it, but in a moment she made one swift rush at her prey.\r\nThe squirrel ran at full speed, but alas! before we could interfere it\r\nwas caught and carried away.\r\n\r\nAt Dropmore, the gardener told us he had a cat that kept the Pinetum\r\nquite clear of squirrels. They certainly nibble the young shoots of firs\r\nand horse-chestnuts unmercifully in the spring, and one very dry summer\r\nthey took very kindly to our peaches and nectarines; but I freely\r\nforgive their little sins, and should be sorry to miss them from the\r\nlawn where there are often four or five to be seen at once.\r\n\r\nThey chase each other round a tree-stem with wonderful agility, and\r\nexpress their animosity with angry grunts and a stamp of the foot like a\r\nrabbit. In autumn I have acorns and beech-mast collected, and store some\r\nbushels of each to be doled out through the winter and spring; strewn\r\nunder the tulip-tree this food, mixed with corn, attracts an amusing\r\nvariety of live creatures. Besides the squirrels which are constantly\r\nthere, we see jays, wood-pigeons, jackdaws, rooks, and flocks of the\r\nsmaller birds; if snow should prevail, a whole rookery will come to see\r\nwhat is to be had. By constantly watching their movements I have learnt\r\nthat the squirrel's tail has quite a language of its own. It can be\r\ncurved over its back and so spread out that on a wet day it forms a\r\ncomplete shelter from rain. It will take the form of a note of\r\ninterrogation or lie flat on the ground, stand out at an angle or\r\nbristle with anger, according to the mood of the possessor.\r\n\r\nI did not find the American chipmunks, before alluded to, at all\r\ntameable. They were very handsome, of grey colour with dark brown\r\nstripes on their sides.\r\n\r\nThey were extremely wild, and would spring round their cage in perfect\r\nterror when looked at, so, finding they could not be made happy in\r\nconfinement, I let them loose in the garden in the hope they might\r\nburrow under a large rhododendron clump, but after a day or two they\r\ndisappeared, and I suppose they made their escape to a neighbouring\r\nwood, so that I have little hope of ever seeing them again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA MOLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA live mole above-ground is a somewhat rare sight, for, as a rule, his\r\nhabits are altogether subterranean; but now and then he may be captured\r\nby a sudden grasp as he scrambles along in his odd, unwieldly fashion,\r\nand a curious fellow he is in many ways.\r\n\r\nStrolling quietly along a country lane one summer's evening, I heard a\r\ngreat rustling in a dry ditch, the dead leaves were being scattered\r\nright and left, and I stopped to see what could be the cause. In a\r\nminute the black velvet coat of a mole appeared, and I at once resolved\r\nto endeavour to catch it, though with little hope of success, for the\r\ncreature is apt to dive into the ground in an instant when alarmed.\r\nHowever, watching my opportunity, I managed to seize and hold him\r\nfirmly; but I had nothing to put him in, and he struggled furiously to\r\nescape. All I could do was to roll him up in one end of my black lace\r\nshawl and hurry home with my capture. Alas! for the unlucky shawl--the\r\nmole soon began rending and tearing it into shreds with his powerful\r\nfeet and teeth. I was rapidly becoming acquainted with the habits of\r\nmoles, and in a way that I should not soon forget; still, that mole must\r\nbe brought home somehow, and I next transferred him to my dress pocket,\r\nwhich I held fast, whilst he scrambled and pushed his strong little\r\nsnout in all directions to find some way of escape. He was soon placed\r\nin a zinc fern case, with glass sides, supplied with earth to burrow in,\r\nand fed with worms. I also gave him a pan of water, as I remembered\r\nseeing a plan of a mole's burrow which always includes a place for\r\nwater. It was a really painful sight to watch the creature feeding; he\r\npounced upon a worm with the fury of a tiger, and holding it in his\r\nmouth, tore it to pieces with his sharp claws and rapidly devoured all\r\nthe pieces, and snuffing about to make sure he had quite finished it, he\r\nthen darted off to seek another. The mole has a most voracious appetite\r\nand dies very quickly if unable to obtain food. I was interested to\r\nwatch the bustling, active life of the little creature; his morning\r\ntoilet when the black velvet coat was attended to, carefully brushed and\r\nlicked by a tiny red tongue (though it never seemed to pick up dirt or\r\ndefilement in its passage through the earth) and finally, after a few\r\ndays, I had the pleasure of setting him free, when he dived into the\r\nground out of sight in a moment.\r\n\r\nSome years later a live mole was much desired by a young relative who\r\nwas giving Natural History lectures to some school children. It happened\r\nthat a mole had found its way into the conservatory and was doing much\r\ndamage there by making its runs close to the surface and uprooting the\r\nplants in its course. The gardener and I resolved to catch it; he was\r\nanxious to prevent further mischief to his plants, and I was wishing to\r\nhelp the lecturer by sending a lively specimen to illustrate his\r\nsubject. The exciting part of the business was the necessity of making\r\nthe capture before eleven o'clock, when the carrier would pass by, and,\r\ntaking charge of the animal, would deliver it in time for the lecture\r\nnext day. We watched for the upheaving of the mole's run which came at\r\nlast. The gardener made a quick plunge with his hand into the soft\r\nearth, but alas! the mole escaped. He kept quiet for ten minutes, then\r\nanother attempt was made, and failed. The carrier's bell sounded and he\r\npassed by. I still kept watch, and again saw the earth move--the third\r\ntime was successful. I had gone to find a tin box, and on my return I\r\nwas greeted with \"Here's the mole, ma'am!\" Poor fellow! he was being\r\nignominiously held up by the scruff of his neck, and kicking furiously\r\nat the indignity. He was soon packed up in soft grass, with a plentiful\r\nsupply of worms to feast upon by the way. A special messenger overtook\r\nthe carrier, and a telegram was sent to announce the dispatch of the\r\nprecious animal.\r\n\r\nHe first reached a London office, where I fear he tended to hinder\r\nbusiness, as it was needful to transfer him to a cage, and no one seemed\r\nparticularly anxious for the honour of catching him, as his teeth were\r\nknown to be both sharp and numerous, and his disposition not of the\r\nmeekest. However, he was placed in his cage, travelled down into Kent,\r\nand gave wonderful pleasure when exhibited to the children.\r\n\r\nOne would naturally suppose that in a country village where boys and\r\ngirls are daily going to and from school, they would all have been\r\nfamiliar with this little creature, but when the question was asked if\r\nthey had ever seen a dead mole, only fifteen children out of ninety had\r\nseen one, and only three had ever seen a live one.\r\n\r\nNext day the mole was let loose upon a very hard piece of ground, but\r\neven there he very quickly burrowed out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHARVEST MICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had often wished to keep these interesting little animals, but as they\r\nare only found in some parts of England and are difficult to capture\r\nfrom their minute size and delicacy, I had to wait many years before\r\nthey could be obtained. At length, through the kindness of a friend, six\r\nwere sent to me from Norfolk, and for two years they lived in captivity\r\nand afforded me much pleasure.\r\n\r\nThey are the smallest English rodents, two of them only weighing a\r\nhalfpenny; they are brown in colour with white underneath, very long\r\nwhiskers and prehensile tails. They were made happy by finding all\r\nthings needful for their comfort in a large plant case. A thick layer of\r\ncocoa fibre was spread over the bottom of the case, dry moss and hay\r\nprovided, wheat-ears, oats, and canary seed, and a small cup of water. A\r\nflowerpot in which a number of small branches were fixed afforded\r\nopportunity for exercise in climbing, and a pleasant resting-place was\r\nformed by a half-cocoanut filled with cotton-wool and roofed over with\r\ndry moss, then slung by three wires in a tripod of sticks of\r\ncorky-barked elm, a little hole for entrance being left at one side.\r\nInto this the mice went the moment they were turned into the case, and\r\nin it they mostly lived. I fancy its swinging a little as they moved\r\ninside was congenial to their ideas of comfort. As they live in\r\ncornfields and make a pendulous nest attached to an ear of corn, I\r\nsupplied them with a pot of growing wheat, in the hope that they would\r\nincline to make a nest in it; but I could never induce them to rear a\r\nfamily. They would sit for hours in the corn-stalks and nibble them\r\ninto a heap of shreds, but no nest ever appeared. Their greatest delight\r\nwas a handful of fresh moss full of little insects on which they would\r\nfeed. The greatest excitement was always shown when the moss\r\nappeared--little heads would peep out of the cocoa-husk, little noses\r\nsniffed in all directions, and then, with jerky runs, the tiny folk made\r\ntheir way to the attractive spot, and soon each would be seen sitting up\r\nlike a small kangaroo feasting on a beetle or spider held in the tiny\r\npaws. Sometimes in their great happiness they made a low, sweet chirping\r\nlike a company of wrens conversing cheerily together. When climbing in\r\ntheir tree-branches it was interesting to see how the fine wiry tail was\r\nalways coiled round the stem as the creature descended, so as to keep it\r\nfrom falling and injuring itself.\r\n\r\nCanary seed and brown bread seemed a favourite diet, and if I put a\r\ntrough of growing corn into the case the mice made little burrows\r\nthrough it so as to be able to eat the wheat from below. I had heard a\r\nsad report that my fairy-like pets had a tendency to eat each other as\r\nspring came round! This I fancied might arise from lack of animal food,\r\nso once or twice a week I always gave them a small portion of meat and\r\nthis seemed to prevent any tendency to cannibalism.\r\n\r\nAfter keeping them two years several deaths occurred, so I thought the\r\nremainder should have their liberty, and I had the pleasure of seeing\r\nthem enter one of my corn-stacks where I hope they found all that their\r\nlittle hearts could desire, and possibly they would stray to a\r\nneighbouring bank and found a colony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIAN MOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA rather strange parcel from California reached me by post some years\r\nago. It was marked \"Live animals with care,\" and consisted of a box,\r\ncontaining several divisions, each having fine wire-work to admit air.\r\nIn one I found a spiny creature called a Gecko, in another a beautiful\r\nlizard which had not survived the journey, and in the third a very rare\r\nspecies of mouse known as _Perognathus Pencillatus_. It has a soft silky\r\ncoat of silver grey and fawn colour, and a long tail with a little tuft\r\nat the end, very large black eyes and white paws. It was alive, but weak\r\nand tired with its journey of ten days and all the jars and shocks it\r\nmust have had by the way. I gave it warm milk and soaked bread, which it\r\nseemed to enjoy, and some hours later it was supplied with wheat grains,\r\nthe food upon which it lives in its native country.\r\n\r\nTrue to his natural instinct, mousie soon began to fill both his cheek\r\npouches with the corn, and tried to hide it away as a supply for the\r\nfuture. In a few days the little creature was in perfect health, and he\r\nhas been a great pet now for several years; perfectly tame and gentle,\r\nhe will run about on the table and amuse himself happily wherever he is\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nBeing entirely inodorous he is kept in the drawing-room in a mahogany\r\ncage which was made specially to meet his small requirements. He is a\r\nbusy little creature at night, as he likes daily to make a fresh bed of\r\ncotton-wool, and fusses about with his mouth full of material until he\r\nhas arranged his little couch.\r\n\r\nIn his own country, where the cold is very severe in winter, its habit\r\nis to become perfectly unconscious, exactly as if dead, and in that\r\nstate it can endure the rigour of the climate and wake up when the\r\ntemperature rises. It was once left in a cold room and became in this\r\napparently lifeless state. I was not alarmed, as I knew of its\r\npeculiarity, but it really was difficult to believe it ever could\r\nrevive; there was no trace of warmth, or any apparent beating of the\r\nheart, and so it lay for some days, but on bringing it into a warm room\r\nit became as bright and active as ever. It seems a more intense form of\r\nhibernation than that of our squirrel and dormouse.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist at San Bernardino, from whom I obtained this mouse, told\r\nme he had kept one as a pet for many years, and his specimen lived\r\nentirely without water; as there was sufficient moisture in the wheat\r\ngrains on which it fed to supply its need; but I think it is cruel to\r\nkeep anything without the means of quenching thirst which might arise\r\nfrom an artificial mode of life, so my little pet has always a small jar\r\nof water to which I know it resorts from its requiring to be refilled\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSANCHO THE TOAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout four years ago I began to feed a toad that had found its way into\r\nthe conservatory. He sat daily in one place expecting his meal-worms,\r\nand when he had snapped them up with his curious sticky tongue he would\r\nretire to some hidden nook and be invisible until the next day. Each\r\nwinter he has hibernated as soon as cold weather began, and reappeared\r\nwith the spring sunshine. Sancho is now a very portly, and most amusing\r\npet.\r\n\r\nFew people would guess how much character can be shown by even this\r\npoor, despised reptile when treated with real kindness, regularly fed,\r\nand never frightened or abused. I will describe what happens when Sancho\r\nis \"shown to the public.\"\r\n\r\nSome meal-worms are thrown on the pavement near him. He sits for a time\r\ngazing at them with his gold-rimmed eyes; then slowly creeps towards\r\nthem, fixes his eyes on one of the worms bends his head a little towards\r\nit, then one hears a snap and the prey is taken. The act is so rapid\r\nthat one can never see the tongue that has picked up the\r\nmeal-worm--simply it is gone! The toad's eyes are tightly shut whilst he\r\nswallows the morsel, and then he turns to pick up a second. Now is the\r\ntime to approach him from behind and begin to stroke his leathery, warty\r\nskin. In a few seconds he is in a state of perfect ecstasy, his front\r\nlegs are stretched out, he leans first to one side, then to the other,\r\nto guide the hand where he wishes to be stroked, and at last uplifts his\r\nponderous body until he is an inch or more from the ground, supported on\r\nthe tips of his toes. No description can do justice to the absurdity of\r\nthe attitude, and the rapture seems so intense that food is forgotten,\r\nand so long as Sancho can get any one to stroke him, he is quite\r\noblivious to all around him, although at other times he will hop away as\r\nsoon as any stranger approaches.\r\n\r\nSancho will not, as yet, take anything from my hand, but I hope to bring\r\nhim to that state of tameness in course of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN SNAILS.]\r\n\r\nROMAN SNAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How _can_ you take an interest in snails and slugs?--horrid, slimy,\r\ncrawling things!\" More than once have I heard this kind of remark from\r\nyouthful lips when I produced my grand old Roman snails and gave them a\r\npleasant time for exercise upon the dewy lawn. Now in my secret mind I\r\nthink a snail is a wonderfully curious creature, neither ugly nor\r\n\"horrid\"--it _is_ slimy, but about that I shall have something to say\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nWhen staying at Box Hill, near Dorking, I often saw the great apple\r\nsnail, _Helix Pomatia_, which is only found on chalk soils, and is\r\nsupposed to have been introduced by the Romans, from the quantities of\r\ntheir empty shells found with Roman remains in all parts of England.\r\nThey were kept and fattened in places called \"Cochlearia\" and made into\r\nvarious \"dainty dishes\" which the Romans thought quite fit to set before\r\ntheir kings. It is certain that they are very nutritious creatures, and\r\nthat in times of famine people have supported life and kept themselves\r\nmysteriously \"fat and well-liking\" by resorting to snails and slugs as\r\narticles of diet. Indeed I have heard more than once that the famous\r\n\"Pate de Guimauve\" owes its healing nutritive character to this despised\r\nunivalve, which is said to enter largely into its composition. I brought\r\nseveral apple snails home with me from Box Hill and kept them for many\r\nyears, until I really believe the creatures, in a dim sort of way,\r\nrecognized me as their friend, or at any rate their feeder. I cannot\r\nboast, as I believe an American lady is said to have done, that \"her\r\ntame oysters followed her up and down stairs,\" but certainly my snails\r\nwould, when placed upon the lawn, very frequently crawl towards me, and\r\nwould do so again and again when removed to a distance. As the weather\r\nbecame cold they always hibernated, closing the mouth of the shell with\r\na thin, firm covering, or operculum, of chalk, which, mixed with their\r\nslime, made a substance like plaster of Paris. Thus enclosed they would\r\nlie as if dead until the warmth of the following spring made them push\r\nthe door open and come out, with excellent appetites, ready to eat\r\nvoraciously to make up for their long fast. These Roman snails were\r\nquite five inches long when fully extended, and therefore were much\r\nlarger than our English species; the body was cream colour and the shell\r\na pale tint of buff varying somewhat in different specimens.\r\n\r\nThese creatures were kept in a fern case with glass top and sides, and\r\nit was singular to observe the way in which they could suspend\r\nthemselves (as shown in the drawing) from the top of the box.\r\n\r\nThe substance which exists in the caterpillar of the silkworm moth, and\r\nwhich can be drawn out into fine shreds of silk, is very similar to the\r\nslime of the snail, only in the latter it is not filiform, but exudes as\r\na liquid and then hardens into a thin layer of silk which is strong\r\nenough to support the weight of two of these snails, for, seeing them\r\none day thus suspended, I put them in the scales and ascertained that\r\nthe weight of the two amounted to 2-1/2 ounces.\r\n\r\nThis mucus forms the glistening, shiny track which the snail leaves\r\nbehind it, enabling it to glide easily and painlessly over rough\r\nsubstances which would otherwise lacerate its soft body.\r\n\r\nOne hardly expected to find social feeling and affection in animals so\r\nlow down in the scale of nature, but I do not know what else could have\r\nled my \"Romans\" to caress each other with their long horns by the hour\r\ntogether and always keep close to one another, twisting and curling\r\ntheir yielding bodies round each other in the most odd contortions. Our\r\nEnglish snails hibernate in whole colonies for the winter, which also\r\npoints to their affectionate and gregarious habits.\r\n\r\nIn lifting up some moss I once came upon some yellow, half-transparent\r\neggs about as large as pearl barley, and wishing to know what they would\r\nprove to be I kept them in damp moss under a tumbler for about a\r\nfortnight, when, to my dismay, I found a grand colony of yellow slugs!\r\nand not a little was I teased about these interesting young people. I am\r\nafraid I must own they were given as a _bonne bouche_ to my Virginian\r\nnightingale, who seemed highly to approve of this addition to his daily\r\nfare. Snails' eggs are nearly white and semi-transparent; the empty\r\nshells of young snails are very lovely when placed in a good microscope:\r\nthe polariscope bringing out their exquisite prismatic tints.\r\n\r\nThe gardener one day brought in a testacella, or shelled slug. It fed\r\nupon earth-worms and was quite unlike the ordinary black or grey slug,\r\nof which we have, alas! countless thousands preying upon all the green\r\nthings of the earth. This shelled slug was yellow, and seemed able to\r\nelongate its body very differently to any other species. The shell was\r\nquite small, a simple dome-shaped plate upon the anterior part of the\r\nbody. I kept it for some weeks on damp moss under a tumbler, but it was\r\noften able to escape by flattening itself to a mere thread and then\r\ncrawling under the rim of the tumbler, and at last I gave it liberty as\r\na reward for its persevering efforts to obtain its freedom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAN EARWIG MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had often read of the earwig as an incubating insect, and much wished\r\nto see for myself how she carried out her motherly instincts. One bright\r\nMay morning found me busily turning over stones, clinkers, and old\r\ntree-roots in a fernery, which, having been long undisturbed, seemed a\r\nlikely spot for the nest I wished to find. There seemed no scarcity of\r\nworms, wood-lice, centipedes, or beetles, but no earwigs could I see;\r\nand I was just about to give up the search when, lifting a piece of\r\nstone, I saw a small cavity, about as large as would contain a pea, and\r\nin it lay about twenty-six round, white eggs, hard-shelled and shining,\r\nof the size of a small pin's head. An earwig had placed herself over the\r\neggs, and I was delighted to think at last I had lighted upon the insect\r\nmother I had been searching for. But what was to be done with her? How\r\ncould I watch the process of incubation? The difficulty was solved by\r\nlifting the nest and its mother with a trowel and placing it in a saucer\r\nunder a tumbler, without any displacement of the eggs; thus the mother's\r\ncare could be conveniently watched. The earwig first carefully examined\r\nher new home, touching each morsel of earth and stone with her antennae;\r\nand, having ascertained the exact condition of things, she set to work\r\nto make a fresh nest, labouring with great industry until it was formed\r\nto her mind. She then took up the eggs, one by one, with her mandibles,\r\nand placed them in the new nest, arranging and rearranging them, until\r\nat last she seemed content, and remained either upon or near them for\r\nthe rest of the day, quite motionless.\r\n\r\nEvery night, and sometimes two or three times in the day, she would\r\nform fresh places in the earth, and replace the eggs. To prevent the\r\nsoil becoming too dry, I used to sprinkle a little water upon it--a drop\r\nhere and there--and if by accident the water fell too near the eggs, the\r\nearwig became much excited, hurrying to and fro with her eggs, until\r\nthey were all removed to a drier spot. On the other hand, if I omitted\r\nthe water until the earth became dry, she would choose the dampest spot\r\nthat remained in which to form her nest, and seemed to welcome the\r\nwater-drops, drinking herself from them, and feeling the damp earth with\r\nher antennae. She remained thus for three weeks, feeding on little pieces\r\nof beef or mutton, or an occasional fly; I did not then know that\r\nearwigs are mostly vegetable feeders, but it is clear they can eat other\r\nfood when needful. The first time I dropped a newly-killed house-fly\r\nnear her she looked at it intently, felt it with her antennae, and then\r\nsuddenly wheeled round and pinched it with her forceps, and being\r\napparently satisfied that it could do no harm to her eggs, she began to\r\ndevour it, and after an hour or two but little remained except the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nAs it was early in the year, but few insects could be seen, but by\r\nsearching in the conservatory I found a large green aphis, which I gave\r\nto the earwig. To my surprise, instead of devouring it at once, she\r\napplied herself to one of the projecting tubes of the aphis, and\r\nevidently sucked its sweet secretion, and enjoyed it as much and in the\r\nsame way as ants are said to do. She feasted thus for four or five\r\nminutes, but I am sorry to add that, unlike the humane ants, who care\r\ntenderly for their aphides and preserve their lives by kind treatment,\r\nthe earwig ended by munching up the unfortunate aphis, till not a trace\r\nof it was left.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three weeks I found one morning all the eggs were hatched,\r\nand tiny, snow-white earwigs, with forceps and antennae fully developed,\r\nwere creeping about and around their mother. I placed a slice of pear in\r\nthe saucer, upon which the little ones swarmed, and seemed to find it\r\ncongenial food. In a few days they increased to nearly double their size\r\nwhen first hatched, and turned a light brown colour. Having ascertained\r\nall I wished to know about the maternal instincts of the earwig, I\r\nreleased the mother and her family, and no doubt she was happy enough to\r\nreturn to her old haunt in the fernery, and would greatly prefer\r\ntree-roots and stones to my tumbler-and-saucer arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGYPTIAN BEETLES.]\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED BEETLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reading books on Egypt and the voyage up the Nile, one is sure to\r\nfind some mention of the curious beetle which is found along the banks\r\nof the river, especially in Nubia, where the shore is traceried with the\r\nfootprints of the busy little creature. Miss Edwards, in her very\r\ninteresting book, \"A Thousand Miles up the Nile,\" thus speaks of it:\r\n\"Every one knows how this scarab was adopted by the Egyptians as an\r\nemblem of creative power and the immortality of the soul; it is to be\r\nseen in the wall-sculptures, on the tombs, cut out in precious stones\r\nand worn as an ornament, buried in the mummy-cases, and a figure of the\r\nbeetle forms a hieroglyph, and represents a word signifying 'To be and\r\nto transform.' If actual worship was not paid to _Scaraboeus Sacer_,[1]\r\nit was, at any rate, regarded with the greatest reverence and a vast\r\namount of symbolism drawn from its various characteristics.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Or _Ateuchus Sacer_.]\r\n\r\nI had often wished to see this insect alive, and one day my wish was\r\nvery unexpectedly gratified by the arrival of a small tin box in which I\r\nfound a specimen of the sacred beetle swathed in wet linen like a\r\nveritable mummy, only, instead of being an Egyptian specimen, this had\r\ncome from a kind friend at the Riviera, who knew that the same species\r\nexisted there, and had sent me this one by post. The scarab was at once\r\nnamed \"Cheops,\" and treated with all the respect due to his ancient\r\nfamily traditions.\r\n\r\nHis wants were easily supplied: a deep tin box, with earth and moss\r\nslightly damped, gave him space for exercise; and then for food--alas!\r\nthat his tastes should be so degraded--he had to be supplied with\r\ncow-dung! This could be done in secret, and judiciously hidden by fair,\r\ngreen moss; but when exhibiting my cherished pet to admiring friends\r\nthe first question was sure to be, \"What does he feed upon?\" and one had\r\nto take refuge in vague generalities about organic substances, &c.,\r\nwhich might mean anything, and then, by diverting attention to some\r\npoint of interest apart from the food question, the difficulty was\r\ngenerally overcome.\r\n\r\nI kept a close watch to see if the beetle would be led by instinct to\r\nform its round pellets of mud as is its custom on the banks of the Nile,\r\nand having placed its egg in the centre, it begins to roll it from the\r\nmargin of the river until it is above high-water mark. There it digs a\r\nhole and buries the pellet, leaving the sun to hatch the eggs in due\r\ntime. Travellers who have watched the process describe the untiring way\r\nin which both the male and female beetle roll these pellets, often\r\nfalling down with their burden into holes and ridges in the rough\r\nground; but then their comrades will give them help, and, picking up the\r\nball, they patiently labour on. Walking backwards, having the pellet\r\nbetween their broad hind legs, they push it up and up until it is\r\nplaced in safety. The persevering energy of this insect led the\r\nEgyptians to adopt it as an emblem of the labours of their great deity,\r\nOsiris, or the sun; they also traced a resemblance in the spiny\r\nprojections on its head to the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nGreat was my delight to find at length that Cheops--even in\r\ncaptivity--was true to his native instincts, that he had formed a pellet\r\nabout the size of a marble and was gravely rolling it with his hind legs\r\nbackwards and forwards in his box. Poor captive! he was evidently\r\npuzzled what to do with the precious thing. He had no Nile bank to\r\nsurmount, and the sun was hardly warm enough to encourage any hope for\r\nhis future family; but he did the only thing that was possible--he set\r\nto work to scoop out a hole of sufficient size, then rolled the pellet\r\nin and covered it over with loose earth. Three such pellets were made at\r\nintervals of a few days; one of them I unearthed and kept as a curio.\r\nThe beetle never seemed to miss it, and having done his duty under\r\ndifficult circumstances, his mind seemed to be at rest.\r\n\r\nI often placed Cheops in my hand to show him to visitors, and there he\r\nwould lie feigning to be dead until he was gently stroked over the\r\nelytra, when he would stretch out his antennae, then his legs by slow\r\ndegrees appeared (for he tucked them close to his body out of sight when\r\nfrightened), and at last he would begin to walk in a jerky manner, as if\r\nmoved by machinery, often stopping to look and listen to be sure that it\r\nwas safe to move, and even if busily at work in the earth, if he saw any\r\none coming near he would stop, draw in his antennae and limbs and remain\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nHe had a strong and peculiar odour at times, which became more apparent\r\nif he was annoyed. He was infested with a small mite, and though these\r\nwere frequently cleared away with water and a camel's-hair brush, they\r\nalways reappeared in a day or two, clustering under the thorax between\r\nthe first pair of legs, and at times they might be seen racing over his\r\nbody with great rapidity. Once Cheops nearly escaped, for I had placed\r\nhis box in the sun, and the warmth so excited and waked him up that he\r\nopened his wing-cases, used his gauze-like inner wings, and with a\r\nmighty hum was all but gone in search of his native land, but\r\nfortunately I was near enough to intercept his flight and place him in\r\nsafe quarters. After keeping this curious creature in perfect health for\r\nsixteen months, I was much vexed to find him one morning lying in a\r\nshallow pan of water in his box, quite dead. He had overbalanced on to\r\nhis back, and, being unable to turn over, had been drowned, though the\r\nwater was scarcely half an inch deep. Poor Cheops is enshrined in a\r\npyramid-shaped box, in which he is often shown and his life-history told\r\nto interested visitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAP-DOOR SPIDERS.]\r\n\r\nSPIDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the varieties of \"creeping things\" spiders seem to be the most\r\nuniversally disliked. I knew well the kind of expression I should see on\r\nthe faces of my friends when I produced the box which contained my pet\r\nTegenaria, a large black spider, long-legged and very swift, a\r\nwell-known kind of house-spider.\r\n\r\nHappily the box had a glass lid, so the inmate could be seen in comfort;\r\nand when the spider's history was told there was always an interest\r\ncreated in even this poor despised creature.\r\n\r\nWhen first placed in its new home the Tegenaria began spinning tunnels\r\nof white silky web in various directions across the box. They were\r\nalmost as close in texture as fine gauze, and had openings here and\r\nthere, so that they formed a kind of labyrinth.\r\n\r\nThe spider always lived in one corner, curled up, watching for prey, and\r\nwhen a blue-bottle was put in, and began buzzing, she then rushed up one\r\ntunnel and down another until she could pounce upon her prey.\r\n\r\nThe fly was quickly killed by her poison fangs, and then carried to the\r\ncorner to be consumed at leisure. Unlike the habit of the garden or\r\ndiadem spider, no cobweb was rolled round the victim; only the wings\r\nwere cut off and the body carried away. After some months I noticed the\r\ncorner seemed filled up with web and fragments of insects, and when I\r\nexamined it more closely there appeared a large round ball of eggs, over\r\nwhich the spider had spun some web, and then had collected all the legs\r\nand wings of her prey and stuck them carelessly here and there in the\r\nweb so as to conceal her nest, and make it look like the remains of an\r\nold cobweb. Over this nest she kept careful watch. One could not drive\r\nher from it; she only left it for a moment to spring upon a fly, and\r\nwould return with her food immediately and resume her watchful life in\r\nthe corner. At length the young spiders were hatched in countless\r\nnumbers; they crept about the tunnels, and though so minute as to be\r\nmere specks, they were perfect in form, active in seeking for prey, and\r\nappeared perfectly able to take care of themselves and begin life on\r\ntheir own account.\r\n\r\nI had kept the Tegenaria more than a year in confinement, and having\r\nshown such admirable motherly instincts, I thought she had earned the\r\nreward of liberty. No doubt she welcomed \"the order of release\"! At any\r\nrate, she scampered away under some tree-roots, and possibly resides\r\nthere with her numerous family to this day.\r\n\r\nSpiders hunt their prey in a variety of ways--some by spinning their\r\nbeautiful web, with which we are all familiar; others, as the Zebra\r\nspiders, catch flies by leaping suddenly upon them, and these may often\r\nbe seen on window-sills watching some coveted insect, drawing slowly\r\nnearer to the victim, till, by a well-directed spring, it can be\r\nsecured. There are nearly three hundred species of spiders in this\r\ncountry, and nearly all spin and weave their silken threads in some way,\r\nbut each in different fashions, according to their mode of life. The\r\nfemale spider is the spinner, and her supply is about 150 yards. When\r\nshe has used that amount a few days' rest will enable her to secrete a\r\nsimilar quantity.\r\n\r\nWith great pains the spider's silk has been obtained and woven into a\r\ndelicate kind of material; but as each spider only yields one grain of\r\nsilk, and 450 were required to produce one yard, the process was found\r\nto be impracticable. The insect possesses silk of two colours,\r\nsilver-grey and yellow; one is used for the foundation-lines of the web,\r\nand the other for the interlacing threads. The silk is drawn by the\r\nspider from its four spinnerets, and issues from them in a soft, viscid\r\nstate, but it hardens by exposure to the air. If a web is examined with\r\na magnifying-glass, it will be seen that its threads are closely\r\nstudded with minute globules of gum, which is so sticky that flies\r\ncaught in the web are held in this kind of birdlime until the spider is\r\nable to spring upon them.\r\n\r\nAstronomers and microscopists make use of the strongest lines of the\r\nspider's web to form some of their delicate instruments. The thread is\r\ndrawn in parallel lines at right angles across the field of the\r\neye-piece at equal distances, so as to make a multitude of fine\r\ndivisions, scarcely visible to the naked eye, and so thin as to be no\r\nobstacle to the view of the object. One means of classifying spiders is\r\nby the number of eyes they possess. These are usually two, six, or eight\r\nin number. The fangs with which the spider seizes its prey are hollow,\r\nand emit a venomous fluid into the body of the victim, which speedily\r\nbenumbs and kills it. In Palestine and other countries a kind of spider\r\nis found which is entirely nocturnal in its habits, and never either\r\nhunts or feeds in daylight, but makes itself a little home, where it\r\nabides safely till sunset. It is called the trap-door spider, from the\r\ncurious way in which it protects the entrance to its nest. It bores a\r\nhole in the dry earth of a bank a foot or more in depth, lines the hole\r\nwith silk, and forms a lid, or trap-door, which secures the spider from\r\nall intruders. I have one of these nests in which the door is a\r\nwonderful piece of mechanism, quite round and flat, about as large as a\r\nthreepenny piece, made of layers of fine earth moistened and worked\r\ntogether with silk, so that it is tough and elastic and cannot crumble.\r\nThe hinge is made of very tough silk, and is so springy that when opened\r\nit closes directly with a snap. The outside is disguised with bits of\r\nmoss, glued on so that no one can see where the door is. The only way of\r\nopening it is with a pin, and even then the spider will hold on inside\r\nwith his claws, so that it is not easy to overcome his resistance.\r\nAmongst some insects sent to me from Los Angelos is a huge \"Mygale,\" a\r\nhairy monster of very uninviting aspect. When its legs are outspread it\r\nmeasures nearly six inches across, and one can well believe the stories\r\none hears of its killing small birds if it finds them on their nests. A\r\ngentleman living in Bermuda is said to have tamed a spider of the\r\nspecies \"Mygale,\" and made it live upon his bed-curtain and rid him of\r\nthe flies and mosquitoes which disturbed his nightly rest. He thus\r\ndescribes this remarkable pet: \"I fed him with flies for a few days,\r\nuntil he began to find himself in very comfortable quarters, and thought\r\nof spinning a nest and making his home. This he did by winding himself\r\nround and round, combing out the silk from the spinnerets at the end of\r\nhis body till he had made a nest as large as a wine-glass, in which he\r\nsat motionless until he saw a fly get inside our gauzy tent; then I\r\ncould fancy I saw his eyes twinkle as his victim buzzed about, till,\r\nwhen it was within a yard or so of him, he took one spring and the fly\r\nwas in his forceps, and another leap took him back to his den, where he\r\nsoon finished the savoury morsel. Sometimes he would bound from side to\r\nside of the bed and seize a mosquito at every spring, resting only a\r\nmoment on the net to swallow it. In another corner of the room was the\r\nnest of a female Mygale of the same species. She spun some beautiful\r\nlittle silk bags, larger than a thimble, of tough yellow silk, in each\r\nof which she laid more than a dozen eggs. When these hatched the young\r\nspiders used to live on her back until they were old enough to hunt for\r\nthemselves. I kept my useful friend on my bed for more than a year and a\r\nhalf, when, unfortunately, a new housemaid spied his pretty brown house,\r\npulled it down, and crushed under her black feet my poor companion.\"\r\nThis kind of spider, or an allied species, captures large butterflies in\r\nthe tropical woods by hanging strong silken noozes from branches of\r\ntrees, and they have been seen to kill small birds by this method. One\r\nof our British spiders lives under water in a dome-like cell of silk,\r\nwhich is filled with air like a diving-bell by the spider carrying down\r\nsuccessive globules of air between its legs, which it liberates under\r\nthe dome until it is filled; and the young are hatched there.\r\n\r\nThe spider, on its way through the water, never gets wet. It is hairy,\r\nand is enveloped in a bubble of air, in which it moves about protected\r\nfrom wet and well supplied with air to breathe. As the spider's supply\r\nof food is always precarious, they are able to live a long time without\r\neating. One is known to have lived eighteen months corked up in a\r\nphial, where it could obtain no food; but though thus able to fast, the\r\nspider is a voracious feeder, and will eat his own kith and kin when\r\nhard pressed by hunger.\r\n\r\nI believe it is now thought that the spider of the Scriptures was a kind\r\nof spiny lizard called the Gecko. One of this species was sent to me\r\nfrom California, and lived for a few weeks, but as nothing would induce\r\nit to eat, to my great regret it pined and died. It was about as large\r\nas an ordinary full-grown toad, of a speckled grey colour, with rich\r\nbrown markings, its head something like a lizard, with large thorny\r\nprojections which extended all along the spine. The feet were very\r\nremarkable, each toe being furnished with a sucker which enabled the\r\nGecko to walk with perfect ease in any position on a wall or pane of\r\nglass without losing its hold; and travellers say that it is a frequent\r\ninmate of Eastern houses, and may be seen catching flies as it creeps\r\nalong walls and ceilings.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of spiders run with ease upon the surface of ponds and\r\nditches, and one forms a kind of raft of a few dead leaves woven\r\ntogether, on which it sits and is blown by the wind hither and thither,\r\nand thus is enabled to prey upon various aquatic insects.\r\n\r\nThe surface of grass lawns may be seen on autumnal mornings covered with\r\ntiny webs gemmed with dew. We may therefore estimate the immense number\r\nof flies captured by these traps so thickly spread over the grass, and\r\nsee in them another proof of the adaptation of each created thing for\r\nits special purpose, and how wonderfully the balance of nature is\r\nmaintained, so that one creature keeps another in check, and all work\r\nharmoniously together, according to the will of our great Creator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTAME BUTTERFLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn _The Century_, for June, 1883, Mr. Gosse described a monument, in\r\nwhich the sculptor had carved a child holding out her hand for\r\nbutterflies to perch on. He went on to say that this was criticised as\r\nimprobable, even by so exact an observer as the late Lord Tennyson. It\r\nmay therefore be of some interest to record the following facts from my\r\npersonal experience.\r\n\r\nOne summer I watched the larvae of the swallow-tailed butterfly through\r\ntheir different stages, and reserved two chrysalides to develop into\r\nthe perfect insect. In due time one of these fairy-like creatures came\r\nout. I placed it in a small Indian cage, made of fine threads of bamboo.\r\nA carpet of soft moss and a vase of flowers in the centre made a\r\npleasant home for my tiny \"Psyche.\"\r\n\r\nI found that she greatly enjoyed a repast of honey; when some was placed\r\non a leaf within her reach, she would uncoil her long proboscis and draw\r\nup the sweet food with great apparent enjoyment.\r\n\r\nShe was so tame that it became my habit, once or twice a day, to take\r\nher on my finger; and while I walked in the garden she would take short\r\nflights hither and thither, but was always content to mount upon my hand\r\nagain. She would come on my finger of her own accord, and, if the day\r\nwas bright, would remain there as long as I had patience to carry her,\r\nwith her wings outspread, basking in the sunbeams, which appeared to\r\nconvey exquisite delight to the delicate little creature.\r\n\r\nI never touched her beautiful wings. She never fluttered or showed any\r\nwish to escape, but lived three weeks of tranquil life in her tiny\r\nhome; and then having, as I suppose, reached the limit of butterfly\r\nexistence, she quietly ceased to live.\r\n\r\nOn the day of her death the other butterfly emerged, and lived for the\r\nsame length of time. Both were equally tame, but the second showed more\r\nintelligence, for she discovered that by folding her wings together she\r\ncould easily walk between the slender bars of the cage; and having done\r\nso she would fly to a window, and remain there basking in the sun,\r\nfolding and unfolding her wings with evident enjoyment, until I\r\npresented my finger, when she would immediately step upon it and be\r\ncarried back to her cage.\r\n\r\nThe tameness of these butterflies I ascribed in great measure to the\r\nfact of their having been hatched from chrysalides, and having therefore\r\nnever known the sweets of liberty. I often wondered if really wild\r\nspecimens could be won by gentle kindness and made happy in confinement,\r\nand one bright summer's day I resolved to try. A \"Painted Lady\" had been\r\nseen in the garden the day before, and I soon caught sight of her making\r\nrapid flights from one bed of flowers to another, and when resting for\r\na few minutes, folding and unfolding her wings on the gravel path, I\r\ncrept slowly up to her with a drop of honey on my finger to try and make\r\nfriends; but my \"lady\" was coy, \"she would and she wouldn't,\" and after\r\nletting me come within a few inches with my tempting repast, she floated\r\naway, out of sight, and I feared she would not be willing to give me\r\nanother chance; however, I waited quietly, and in a few minutes she\r\nalighted at a little distance. I again drew near very slowly, and again\r\nshe sailed away, but the third time she gained confidence enough to\r\nreach out her proboscis and taste the honey, and finally crept upon my\r\nfinger. I very gently placed the light bamboo cage over her and brought\r\nher indoors; she, all the while, entranced with the sweet food, remained\r\nquietly on my finger, and when satisfied, crept upon a flower in the\r\nmiddle of the cage, and after a few flutterings round her cage seemed\r\ncontent and folded her delicate wings to rest. Whilst engaged in her\r\ncapture I had observed a \"Red Admiral\" hovering over some dahlias, and\r\nthinking \"Cynthia\"[2] might like a companion, I tried my blandishments\r\nupon him. I had not much hope of success, for though a bold, fearless\r\nfellow, he is very wary, and his powerful wings bear him away in swift\r\nflight when alarmed. Many a circle did I make around that dahlia bed!\r\n\"Admiral\" always preferred the opposite side to where I stood, and\r\ncalmly crossed over whilst I went round. At last, by long and patient\r\nwaiting, he, too, allowed me to come near and present my seductive food\r\nto his notice--the wiry proboscis was uncoiled and felt about for the\r\nhoney; once plunged into that, all volition seemed to cease, he allowed\r\nme to coax him upon my finger, and he, too, was safely caged; but he\r\nbehaved very differently from \"fair Cynthia.\" The moment his repast was\r\nended he flapped with desperate force against the bars, and in a minute\r\nhe was out and on the window-pane, fluttering to escape. The cage had to\r\nbe secured with fine net, and he was replaced and soon quieted down.\r\nTwice a day these delicate little pets would come upon my hand to\r\nreceive their sweet food, and appeared perfectly content in captivity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The former Latin name for the \"Painted Lady\" butterfly]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nANT-LIONS.\r\n\r\n(MYRMELEON FORMICARIUS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago a friend sent me some of these remarkable insects from\r\nthe Riviera, and for sixteen months I fed them as regularly as possible,\r\nbut the cold of a remarkably severe winter killed them, to my great\r\ndisappointment, as I had hoped to be rewarded by a sight of the perfect\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nAnt-lions are not, I believe, found in any part of England, so I had to\r\nwait till I could again procure some from the south of France, where\r\nthey are frequently met with in dry, sandy places.\r\n\r\nEarly in March this year (1890) three specimens were sent me and were at\r\nonce placed in a box of dry silver sand, where they buried themselves\r\nand remained quietly resting for some hours.\r\n\r\nMany of my readers may be interested to know what the ant-lion is like,\r\nand why I thought it worth while to take great pains to rear it. These\r\nyoung specimens were flat, grey, six-legged creatures about the size of\r\na small lady-bird, covered with hairs, and possessing two strong forceps\r\nprojecting from their heads. They are so formed that they cannot go\r\nforward, but move always backward by a series of jerks. As they live\r\nupon ants and are so strangely formed, they have to resort to stratagem\r\nin order to entrap their prey, and this they do by means of pits formed\r\nin the sand in which they live; into these pits the ants fall, and are\r\nseized by the forceps of the ant-lion, who lies in wait at the bottom.\r\n\r\nMany a time have I watched the formation of these pits, and will try to\r\ndescribe the process. The insect begins describing a small circle on\r\nthe surface of the sand by jerking himself backwards and flinging the\r\nsand away with his flat head and closed forceps, which form a kind of\r\nshovel. Each circle is smaller than the last, until the pit is like an\r\ninverted cone, and the ant-lion lies buried at the bottom, only his\r\nforceps being visible. When an ant has fallen headlong down into the pit\r\nit makes frantic efforts to escape, and if the ant-lion sees that it is\r\nlikely to get beyond his reach, he then with his forceps flings some\r\nsand at it with such unerring aim the poor victim is sure to roll over\r\nand over until it reaches the jaws of its captor, who feasts upon it and\r\nthen flings the remains of the body out of the pit.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty was how to ensure a supply of ants, but this was overcome\r\nby filling a box with part of an ants' nest, and as these insects\r\nsettled down and seemed content with their quarters, they were ready\r\nwhen wanted, and three times a day the lions had to be fed! One learns\r\nto sacrifice one's feelings in the cause of science, but to the last it\r\nwas a real distress to me to have to put the poor little ants where they\r\nwould be devoured; but Nature is cruel, and from the real lion to his\r\ninsect namesake, preying upon one another seems the prevailing law of\r\nher realm.\r\n\r\nAs the ant-lions grew, the pits increased in size. At first they were\r\nabout as large as a threepenny-piece, but ended by measuring more than\r\ntwo inches across.\r\n\r\nI could not tell whether the insect moulted its skin, as it was always\r\nhidden, but in July, after four months' feeding, the ant-lions changed\r\ninto chrysalides, which looked like perfectly round balls of sand.\r\n\r\nThe box was placed in a warm greenhouse, and in seven weeks' time the\r\nperfect insects appeared. They were like small dragon-flies, with\r\nslender bodies, four black-spotted gauzy wings, two large black eyes and\r\nshort antennae.\r\n\r\nI had read about their being nocturnal insects, feeding on flies, so\r\nthey had that diet provided for them in the glass globe in which they\r\nwere kept, but I could never feel sure that they ate the flies, and\r\nfearing they would be starved I tried giving them a little sweet food, a\r\ndrop of raspberry syrup at the end of a twig; it seemed to be the right\r\nthing, for they greedily sucked it in, but in spite of all my care they\r\nonly lived four weeks; which, however, is probably the term of their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was writing this paper a singular incident occurred. I heard a\r\nstrange, wild note, and something brilliant dashed past me to the end of\r\nthe room, and there, on a white marble bust sat a lovely kingfisher--a\r\nbird I had hardly ever seen, even at a distance, and here he had come to\r\npay me a visit in my drawing-room. Would that I could have told him how\r\nwelcome he was! but, alas! he darted about the room in wild alarm, flew\r\nagainst the looking-glasses, and though I tried to guard him from a\r\nplate-glass window, that has often proved fatal to birds, I was too\r\nlate; he came with a crash against it and fell down quite dead, his neck\r\nbeing broken by the force of the blow.\r\n\r\nI had heard that a kingfisher had been seen at my lake, and hoped that\r\nthe bird might build and become established there; it was, therefore, a\r\nkeen regret to me that this bright visitant had met with such an\r\nuntimely fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROBIN.]\r\n\r\nROBINS I HAVE KNOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I once begin to speak about these winning, confiding little birds, I\r\nshall hardly know when to stop. There can scarcely be a more delightful\r\npet than a wild robin which has learnt to love you, and will come\r\nindoors and be your quiet companion for hours together. One can feel\r\nhappy in the thought that he has his liberty and his natural food out of\r\ndoors, and that he gives you his companionship freely because he likes\r\nto be with you, and shows that he does, by singing his sweet songs\r\nperched on the looking-glass or some vase of flowers.\r\n\r\nAutumn is the best time to begin taming such a little friend. When one\r\nof those brown-coated young birds in his first year's plumage (before\r\nthe red feathers show) takes to haunting the window-ledge, or looks up\r\ninquiringly from the gravel path outside, then is the time to throw out\r\na mealworm, four or five times a day, when the bird appears. He will\r\nsoon associate you with his pleasant diet, and come nearer, and grow\r\ndaily less fearful, until, by putting mealworms on a mat just inside the\r\nroom, he will come in and take them, and at last learn to be quite\r\ncontent to remain. The first few times the window should be left open to\r\nlet him retreat, for unless he feels he can come and go at will he will\r\nprobably make a dash at a closed window, not seeing the glass, and be\r\nfatally injured, or else too frightened to return.\r\n\r\nLike all other taming, it must be carried on with patience.\r\n\r\nOne summer, many years ago, we occupied an old-fashioned house in the\r\ncountry, where, in perfect quietude, one could make acquaintance with\r\nbirds and study their habits and manners without interruption. From the\r\nveranda of a large, low-ceilinged sitting-room one looked out upon a\r\ngarden of the olden type, full of moss-grown apple-trees, golden\r\ndaffodils, lupines and sweet herbs, that pleasant mixture of the kitchen\r\nand flower garden which always seems so enjoyable. It was an ideal home\r\nfor birds, no cat was ever visible, and from the numbers of the\r\nfeathered folk one could believe that countless generations had been\r\nreared in these apple-trees and lived out their little lives in perfect\r\nhappiness. I soon found a friend amongst the robins; one in particular\r\nbegan to pay me frequent visits as I sat at work indoors. At first he\r\nventured in rather timidly, took a furtive glance and then flew away,\r\nbut finding that crumbs were scattered for him, and while he picked them\r\nup a kindly voice encouraged his advances, he soon became at ease, made\r\nhis way into the room and seemed to examine by turns, with birdish\r\ncuriosity, all the pieces of furniture and the various ornaments on the\r\nmantelpiece and tables. Much to my pleasure he began to sing to me, and\r\nvery pretty he looked, sitting amongst the flowers in a tall vase,\r\nwarbling his charming little ditty, keeping his large black eyes fixed\r\nupon me as if to see if I seemed impressed by his vocal efforts.\r\n\r\nOnce he stopped in the middle of his song, looked keenly at a corner of\r\nthe ceiling, and after a swift flight there, he returned with a spider\r\nin his beak; one can well believe what good helpers the insect-eating\r\nbirds must be to the gardener, by destroying countless hosts of minute\r\ncaterpillars and grubs that would otherwise prey upon the garden\r\nproduce. Bobbie continued his visits to me throughout the summer,\r\nremaining happy and content for hours at a time, pluming himself,\r\nsinging, and at times investigating the contents of a little cupboard,\r\nwhere he sometimes discovered a cake which was much to his taste, on\r\nwhich he feasted without any leave asked, though truly it would have\r\nbeen readily given to such a pleasant little visitor. He soon showed\r\nsuch entire confidence in me that he would perch on the book I was\r\nreading, and alight on my lap for crumbs even when many people were in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nWhen we had to leave this country home I wished that dear Bobbie could\r\nhave been packed up to go elsewhere with our other possessions, but\r\nsince this could not be, let us hope he still inhabits the old garden\r\nand cheers other home-dwellers with his confiding manners and morning\r\nand evening songs of praise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nROBERT THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter slight intimacies with various robins who were visitors to the\r\nconservatory and found their way in and out at the open windows, I was\r\nled to special friendship with a brown-coated young bird I used often to\r\nsee close to the open French window where I was sitting. He was coaxed\r\ninto the room by mealworms being thrown to him until he made himself\r\nquite at home indoors. By the time he had attained his red breast the\r\nweather had become too cold for open windows, but Bobbie would sit on\r\nthe ledge and wait till I let him in, and then he would be my happy\r\nlittle companion for the whole morning, flitting all about the room,\r\nalong the corridor, into the hall--in fact, he was to be found all over\r\nthe house; but when hungry he returned to me as his best friend, because\r\nI was the provider of his delightsome mealworms. It was always amusing\r\nto visitors to see me feed my small fowl! He would be on the alert to\r\nsee where his prey was to be found, and he would hunt for it\r\nperseveringly if it happened to fall out of sight. He was often to be\r\nseen perched on the Californian mouse's cage, and I wondered what could\r\nbe the attraction; at last I discovered that he coveted mousie's brown\r\nbiscuits, and after that he was allowed one for his own use, kept in a\r\nspecial corner, where a cup of water was also provided for his small\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nHowever tame wild birds may seem there will be times when all at once a\r\nsort of intense longing to get out seems to possess them. When this was\r\nthe case Bobbie would fly backwards and forwards uttering his plaintive\r\ncry (one of the six kinds of notes by which robins express their\r\nfeelings), and his distress was so evident that the window was always\r\nopened at once to let him go out.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to have to confess that robins are most vindictive towards\r\neach other! Bobbie maintained a very angry warfare with a hated rival\r\nout-of-doors, in fact his chief occupation in life seemed to be watching\r\nfor his enemy. He might often be seen sitting under a small palm in a\r\npot on the window-ledge, and whilst looking the picture of gentle\r\ninnocence he was, I fear, cherishing envy, hatred, and malice in his\r\nnaughty little heart, for, all at once, there would be a grand\r\nfluttering and pecking at the window whilst the two little furies, one\r\ninside and the other out, expended their strength in harmless warfare\r\nwhich only ceased when they were too exhausted to do more, and then\r\nfollowed on both sides a triumphant song of defiance or victory.\r\n\r\nI must now weave into this biography the life-history of a poor robin\r\nwhich, I suppose, must have been caught in a trap, for it had lost the\r\nlower mandible of its beak, and had only a little knob remaining of the\r\nupper mandible. It haunted the windows, and looked so hungry and\r\nmiserable from its inability to pick up its food, that I thought it\r\nkindest to coax it into a cage where it could be fed with suitable food.\r\nBy placing mealworms in a cage I at last induced it to hop in, and for\r\nfive months it had a very happy life indoors, feeding on soaked brown\r\nbread and all the insect diet I could secure for it. When the cage was\r\ncleaned each morning Bobbie was let out, and would take a bath in a\r\nglass dish, and then fly to the top of the looking-glass, where he would\r\noften remain all day unless we were quick enough to secure his cage-door\r\nwhen he went in to feed. By the middle of May I thought caterpillars\r\nwould be plentiful enough for him to find his own living, so one day he\r\nwas released, but unhappily Robert the Second was close by, and the\r\nmoment he saw the invalid in his cage on the lawn with the door open, he\r\nrushed in and savagely fought the poor defenceless bird. Before we could\r\ninterfere he drove our pet out of his cage, and terrible was the battle\r\nthat went on; the beakless bird was driven far away, and I was quite\r\nunhappy about his fate, for he was now beyond my loving care, and I\r\nnever expected to see him again. Two months passed by, and I only once\r\ncaught a glimpse of the invalid, but at last he came just as before to\r\nthe window, looking thin and ill, with ruffled feathers, and evidently\r\nagain at starvation point. Once more he entered his cage and began his\r\nold life, only now he was hung under the veranda so as to enjoy fresh\r\nair and the songs of his companions. For two months I endeavoured to\r\nkeep the dear little creature happy; we were all so fond of him, and it\r\nseems very touching to think that in his times of extremity he should\r\nhave come willingly into captivity and felt sure that a kind welcome\r\nwould be accorded him. But no amount of care could bring him through the\r\nmoulting season, the lack of a beak to plume his feathers and his great\r\ndifficulty in picking up even the mealworms made him weak and sickly. He\r\ngot out of his cage one day into the garden, and a few days after we\r\nfound his poor little body lying dead close to the window where he had\r\nalways found the help he needed, and yet we could not but be glad that\r\nhis sorrowful little life was ended.\r\n\r\nWhen robins have been thus tamed for years the families they rear are\r\nlike pet birds; they are fed by their parents close to the windows, and\r\nthen come indoors, as if they knew they would be welcome everywhere.\r\n\r\nThere is one feature in the robin's character that, as far as I know, is\r\nshared by no other bird; I mean his adopting a certain spot as his\r\ndistrict and always keeping to it, just as the stickle-backs portion out\r\na pond and jealously defend the territory they have chosen. Here, there\r\nis a special robin to be found at each of the lodges; one haunts the\r\nMission Hall and will often sing vigorously from the reading-stand while\r\nclasses are going on. A very tame one lives in the coachman's house,\r\nrunning about the floor like a little brown mouse, and sitting inside\r\nthe fender on cold days to warm himself. He must have met with trouble\r\nin his early youth, for when first seen he was very lame, and had lost\r\nthe sight of one eye. Through kind care he has become well and strong,\r\nbut he is much at the mercy of his enemies, who often attack him on his\r\nblind side. The conservatory, dining-room, and drawing-rooms have each\r\ntheir little redbreast visitor; the latter is so tame he will take\r\nmeal-worms from my hand, and sits on my inkstand singing a sweet, low\r\nsong whilst I write. As long as each bird keeps to his domain there is\r\npeace, but woe to any intruder! The conflicts are desperate, and I have\r\noften to mediate, and separate two little furies rolling over and over\r\non the ground. I suppose it is in this way that the idea has arisen\r\nabout the young robins killing the old ones; I cannot ascertain that it\r\nhas any foundation--in fact, every robin fights his neighbour all the\r\nyear through, except when paired and busy with domestic duties. As dead\r\nredbreasts are not found specially in autumn, I do not think there can\r\nbe any truth in the superstition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFEEDING BIRDS IN SUMMER AND WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn wintry mornings, when leaf and twig are decked with hoar-frost and\r\nthe ground is hard and dry, affording no food for the birds, it is a\r\npiteous sight to see them cowering under the evergreens with ruffled\r\nfeathers, evidently starving and miserable, quietly waiting for the\r\ndeath that must overtake many of them unless we come to their rescue.\r\n\r\nIt is one of my delights to feed the small \"feathered fowls\" through all\r\nthe winter months, and I only wish all my readers could enjoy with me\r\nthe lovely scenes of happy bird life to be witnessed through the French\r\nwindow opposite my writing-table. These gatherings of birds are the\r\nresult of many years of persistent kindness and thought for the welfare\r\nof my bird pets. Their tameness cannot be attained all at once; it takes\r\ntime to establish confidence; it needs thought about the kinds of food\r\nrequired by various species of birds, regularity in feeding, and quiet\r\ngentleness of manner to avoid frightening any new and timid visitors.\r\nDoubtless there are very many lovers of birds who share this pleasure\r\nwith me, but for those who may not happen to know how to attract the\r\nfeathered tribes I will go a little into detail.\r\n\r\nThis being a large garden near game preserves, and surrounded by a wide,\r\nfurze-covered common, I have been able to attract and tame the ordinary\r\nwild pheasants by putting out Indian corn, buckwheat, and raisins, till\r\nnow they come to the doorstep and look up with their brilliant,\r\nred-ringed eyes, and feed calmly whilst I watch them. It is a really\r\nbeautiful sight to see three or four cock birds, with their\r\ngolden-bronze plumage glistening like polished metal as the morning sun\r\nrests upon them, and as many of their more sober-coloured mates\r\nfeasting on the dainties they find prepared for them; as a rule, they\r\nare very amicable and feed together like barndoor fowls. When satisfied,\r\nthe brown hens run swiftly away to cover, while the cocks, with greater\r\nconfidence, walk quietly away in stately fashion, or remain under the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nWood-pigeons are usually very shy and wary birds, yet these also come,\r\nsix and eight at a time, and feed at my window, Indian corn and peas\r\nbeing their specialities. I have large quantities of beech-nuts and\r\nacorns collected every autumn, and thus I can scatter this food also for\r\npigeons and squirrels all through the winter. Jays, jackdaws, rooks, and\r\nmagpies also approve of acorns and beech-nuts, so it is doing a real\r\nkindness to tribes of birds to reserve this food for them until their\r\nother stores are exhausted, and we can thus bring them within our view\r\nand study their interesting ways, their modes of feeding, and, I fear I\r\nmust add, their squabbles also, for hungry birds are very pugnacious.\r\n\r\nBlackbirds and thrushes are very fond of Sultana raisins; they also like\r\nsplit groats and brown bread crumbs, as also do starlings and, I\r\nbelieve, most of the smaller birds. Fat in any shape or form will\r\nattract the various species of titmice to the window. I always keep a\r\nsmall Normandy basket full of suet and ham-fat hanging on a nail at the\r\nwindow. It is a great rendezvous for these charming little pets, and it\r\nis also supplied with Barcelona nuts for nuthatches, who fully\r\nappreciate them and carry them off to the nearest tree with rugged bark\r\ninto which they fix the nuts, and then hammer at the shell till they can\r\nextract the contents.\r\n\r\nIn very hard frosts I used always to put out a pan of water, as I feared\r\nthe birds suffered from thirst and needed this help. One day, however, I\r\nwas comforted to see some starlings, after a good meal of groats, run\r\noff to the grass plot and eagerly peck at the hoar-frost, which, while\r\nit exists, thus supplies the lack of water.\r\n\r\nBewick says linnets are so named from their fondness for linseed, and I\r\nthink most of the finches like it. The greenfinch is soon attracted by\r\nhemp seed, and all the smaller birds by canary seed. I hope this paper\r\nmay induce many kind hands to minister to the needs of our feathered\r\nfriends during the winter months. It is sad to think of their dying for\r\nlack of the food we can so easily afford them, and they will be sure to\r\nrepay us by their sweet songs and confiding tameness when summer days\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nOne is apt to think that winter is the only time when birds need our\r\nhelp and bounty, but there is almost as much real distress after a long\r\ndrought in summer, especially amongst the insect-eating birds.\r\n\r\nI was led to think of this by the pathetic way in which a hen blackbird\r\ncame to the French window of my room early in June last and stood\r\npatiently waiting and clicking time after time in trouble of _some_ kind\r\nI knew, and, supposing it might be food, I threw out a plentiful supply\r\nof soaked brown bread. At once the poor bird went to it, devouring\r\nravenously for her own needs, and then, filling her beak as full as it\r\nwould hold, she flew off with a supply for her young brood. Then came\r\nthrushes, robins, sparrows, a whole bevy of feathered folk all doing the\r\nsame thing--carrying the provisions in every direction for unseen\r\nfamilies at starvation point, and I began to realize that the month of\r\ncontinued sunshine in which we had rejoiced had brought great distress\r\nupon the birds by drying up the lawns so that no worms could be found,\r\nand, as it was early in the year, but few insects were to be had, so\r\nthat just when each pair of birds had a clamorous brood to provide for\r\nthe food supply had fallen short. Now I understood the pathos of the hen\r\nblackbird's appeal; her dark eyes and note of distress were trying to\r\nsay to me, \"I know you care for us; you seemed so kind last winter; when\r\nwe were without food you fed us and saved our lives; but now I am in far\r\ndeeper distress--my children are crying for food, the grass is dried up,\r\nand the ground so hard that I cannot find a single worm, I am thin and\r\nworn with hunger myself; do help me and my little ones, and we will sing\r\nyou sweet songs in return to cheer you when wintry days come back again.\r\nDoes she understand? I've said all this several times before, but I\r\nthought I would make one last appeal before my children die. Yes; she\r\nhas left the room! I will wait. Ah! here it is, just the soft food that\r\nwill suit my little ones: how they _will_ rejoice and all want to be\r\nfed at once. I hope my friend can understand that I am thanking her with\r\nall my heart.\" Love has a universal language and can interpret through\r\nvaried signs, and thus I quite believe the mother bird's heart wished to\r\nexpress itself.\r\n\r\nEver since that day I have been careful in nesting time to supply\r\nsuitable and varied food for the families of young birds in times of\r\ndrought, for it seems mournful to think of their dying from want, in the\r\nseason of flowers and green leaves, when nature is to us so attractive,\r\nand rendered all the more so by their sweet songs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRAB, MINOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis familiar name recalls the delightful story of \"Rab and his Friends\"\r\nin \"Horae Subsicivae,\" with its naive description of a very original\r\n\"tyke\" of a doggie--a biography which had so lived in my recollection\r\nthat when a queer little fluffy dumpling of a puppy was given me I could\r\nnot help giving it the old familiar name, little knowing how aptly true\r\nthe name would prove to be in after years.\r\n\r\nIs there anything more comical than a young Scotch terrier puppy, with\r\nits preternatural gravity, its queer, ungainly attempts at play, its\r\ntumbles, and blue-eyed simplicity, and, best of all, its sage look, with\r\nhead on one side, trying to consider the merits of some doggie idea\r\nwhich is puzzling his infant brain? Rab went through all the stages of\r\npuppyhood, showing the usual amount of mischief and fun; he might be met\r\ncarrying about some unfortunate slipper frayed to pieces by his busy\r\nteeth, or burying a favourite bone under a wool mat in the drawing-room,\r\nor, worse still, it is recorded in domestic chronicles that he buried a\r\nhymn-book in the garden, whereupon the cook remarked that she believed\r\nhe had more religion in him than half the Christians; but that reasoning\r\nwas not apparent to any one but herself.\r\n\r\nRab's most notable adventures took place after he had emerged from\r\npuppyhood. He had a most indomitable spirit of disobedience; he would\r\nhunt rabbits or anything else he could find in the woods, and one day he\r\nreached home with a snare tightly drawn round his neck, and panting\r\ndistressingly for breath; the wire was cut only just in time to save\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nAnother time he was poisoned by something he had eaten, and had a long\r\nsuffering illness.\r\n\r\nHis fights with other dogs were fierce and frequent, and whilst engaged\r\nin a scrimmage with a hated rival, Rab was run over by a passing cart,\r\nand limped home in a very dejected state; no bones were broken, but he\r\nwas an invalid for some months in consequence.\r\n\r\nAt last it was thought needful to tie him up, and he had his appointed\r\nhouse and a long chain, and with frequent exercise he became quite\r\ncontent. One morning our brave little friend was found nearly dead, with\r\ntwo terrible wounds in his neck, which must have been made by a sharp\r\nknife, driven twice through his throat, but, strangely enough, had each\r\ntime just missed severing the wind-pipe. He had nearly died from loss of\r\nblood, and was scarcely able to breathe; still, our kind servants did\r\nnot give him up; warm milk and beef tea were given him constantly\r\nthrough the day; and by night he had revived a little, and was evidently\r\ngoing to live. We could never trace the origin of this outrage, and\r\ncould only suppose that burglars had purposed breaking into our house,\r\nand, enraged at Rab's barking, had at last got hold of, and, as they\r\nthought, killed him, and flung the body into an adjoining field. Poor\r\nlittle doggie! he suffered grievously for his brave defence, and for\r\nmonths the wounds were a great distress to him and to us; but all that\r\nloving care could do was done, and once more his wonderful constitution\r\nenabled him to regain health and strength. We kept at that time several\r\nvery large mastiffs, and the next adventure occurred early one morning,\r\nwhen we were aroused by a terrific noise in the stable-yard, and the\r\nmessage brought to us was to the effect that Rab was quite dead. He had\r\nbeen worried by one of the mastiffs which had got loose in the night. I\r\nrose quickly and went to see the poor little victim's body, and looking\r\nat it, I saw a little quiver in the eyelid that led to a gleam of hope.\r\nI had him carried indoors, and again teaspoons of milk, &c., were given,\r\nand actually he began to revive, and a feeble wag of his tail, seemed to\r\nsay, \"I'm very bad, but not dead yet.\" The sad part was that the shaking\r\nand worrying he had received had reopened the previous wounds, and\r\nthough after a time he was able to get about, he was quite a wreck; one\r\near was gone, and the other, strange to say, was but a fragment, like\r\nhis namesake in \"Rab and his Friends.\" Still, he lived to be nearly\r\nfifteen, and then rheumatism and loss of teeth made his life a distress\r\nto him, and he was peacefully dismissed to the rest he had bravely\r\nearned by his life of courageous devotion to what he thought the path of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO JAMRACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an old and true saying--\"Everything comes to him who waits.\" I\r\nthought of this saying while on my way to visit the well-known place\r\nnear the London Docks where Mr. Jamrach is supposed to keep almost every\r\nrare animal, bird, and reptile, ready to supply the wants of all\r\ncustomers at a moment's notice. For many long years I had wished to pay\r\nhim a visit, but ill-health and other causes had proved a hindrance and\r\nI could hardly believe my wish was going to be realized when I found\r\nmyself on the way to his menagerie. After driving through a labyrinth of\r\nnarrow, dirty streets, we were at last obliged to get out and walk till\r\nwe came to the shop, and then we did indeed find ourselves in the midst\r\nof \"animated nature.\" We had landed amongst the cockatoos, macaws, and\r\nparrots, and they greeted our arrival with such a chorus of shrieks,\r\nscreams, and hideous cries that my first desire was to rush away\r\nanywhere out of the reach of such ear-piercing sounds. One had to bear\r\nit, however, if the curious creatures in the various cages were to be\r\nexamined, and after a time the uproar grew less, and I could hear a word\r\nor two from Mr. Jamrach, who called my attention to some armadillos,\r\nhuge armour-plated animals, very curious, but somehow not attractive as\r\npets; one could not fondle a thing composed of metal plates, shaped like\r\na pig, with a tendency to roll itself up into a ball on the slightest\r\nprovocation, and even Mr. Jamrach's argument that if I got tired of it\r\nas a pet I could have it cooked, as they were excellent eating, failed\r\nto lead me to a purchase. There was a fine, healthy toucan, with his\r\nmarvellous bill, looking sadly out of place in a small cage in such a\r\ndingy place. Did he ever think of his tropical forest home, I wondered,\r\nand wish himself in happier surroundings? A long wooden box with wire\r\nfront contained rows and rows of Grass Parrakeets: many hundreds must\r\nhave been on those perches, one behind the other, poor little patient\r\nbirdies, sitting in solemn silence, never moving an inch, for they were\r\nwedged in as closely as they could sit and how they could eat and live\r\nseemed a mystery. As I was in quest of some small rodents I was asked to\r\nfollow Mr. Jamrach to another place where the animals were kept. We came\r\nto a back yard with dens and cages containing all kinds of tenants, from\r\nfierce hyenas and wolves to tame deer, monkeys, cats, and dogs. A chorus\r\nof yelps and barks and growls sounded a little uninviting, and a caution\r\nfrom Jamrach, to mind the camel did not seize my young friend's hat,\r\nmade us aware of a stately form gazing down upon us from a recess we had\r\nnot before noticed. Every nook and corner seemed occupied, and in order\r\nto see a kangaroo rat I was invited up a rickety ladder into a loft\r\nwhere a Japanese cat, a large monkey, and sundry other creatures lived.\r\nI did not take to the kangaroo rat, he was too large and formidable to\r\nbe pleasant, and was by no means tame, but to be pulled out of the cage\r\nby his long tail was, I confess, enough to scare the mildest quadruped.\r\nAt length I was shown some Peruvian guinea-pigs. Wonderful little\r\ncreatures! With hair three or four inches long, white, yellow and black,\r\nset on anyhow, sticking out in odd tufts, one side of their heads white\r\nand the other black, their eyes just like boot buttons, they _were_\r\ncaptivating; and a pair had to be chosen forthwith, and packed in a\r\nbasket with a tortoise and a huge Egyptian lizard, and with these spoils\r\nI was not sorry to leave this place of varied noises and smells. The\r\nlizard was about fourteen inches long, a really grand creature. He came\r\nfrom the ruins of ancient Egypt, and looked in his calm stateliness as\r\nthough he might have gazed upon the Pharaohs themselves. When placed in\r\nthe sun for a time he would sometimes deign to move a few inches, his\r\nmassive, grey, scaly body looking very like a young crocodile. I was\r\ngreatly teased about my fondness for \"Rameses,\" as I called this new and\r\nmajestic pet; there was a great fascination about him, and as I really\r\nwished to know more of his ways and habits, I carried the basket in\r\nwhich he lived everywhere with me indoors and out, and studied all\r\npossible ways of feeding him; but alas! nothing would induce him to eat.\r\nAfter gazing for five minutes at the most tempting mealworm, he would at\r\nlast raise up his mighty head and appear to be revolving great ideas to\r\nwhich mealworms and all sublunary things must give place. Jamrach told\r\nme that the lizard would drink milk, so a saucerful was placed before\r\nhim, and once he did drink a few drops, but generally he walked into and\r\nover the saucer as if it did not exist.\r\n\r\nI believe the poor creature had been without food so long that it had\r\nlost the power of taking nourishment, and to my great regret I found it\r\ngrew weaker and thinner, and at last it died, and all I could do was to\r\nsend the remains to a naturalist to be preserved somewhat after the\r\nfashion of its great namesake.\r\n\r\nThe odd little guinea-pigs were named Fluff and Jamrach, and were a\r\nsource of much amusement. As they could not agree, and as the fights\r\ngrew serious, Jamrach was banished to the stable and Fluff occupied a\r\ncage in the dining-room. When let out it was curious to see how he would\r\nalways keep close to the sides of the room--never would he venture into\r\nthe middle, the protection of the skirting board seemed indispensable,\r\nand when let out under the tulip-tree he ran round the trunk in the same\r\nway, only occasionally making an excursion to the edge of the branches\r\nwhich rested on the ground, the space beyond was a _terra incognita_\r\nwhich could not be explored by the timid little beastie.\r\n\r\nThere the two little guinea-pigs enjoyed a happy life on fine days and\r\ngrew to be friends at last, grunting little confidences one to the other\r\nand going to sleep side by side. They had to be watched and their\r\nliberty a good deal curtailed when we found a weasel began to appear\r\nupon the scene, and as it is proverbially difficult to catch a weasel\r\neither awake or asleep, he has not at present been captured. I much fear\r\nif he ever attacked the little Peruvians they would stand a poor chance\r\nof their lives, for they have no idea of self-defence and would fall an\r\neasy prey to such a fierce, relentless persecutor. Perhaps the gardener\r\nmay devise some way of trapping the wary little creature, so that my\r\nlittle friends may dwell in peace under the shady tree.\r\n\r\nAs the winter came on the cold prevented Fluff going out-of-doors, and\r\nhe led a most inactive life. I don't think he ever had more than two\r\nideas in his little brain--he just lived to eat and sleep, and was about\r\nas interesting as a stuffed animal would have been. He is the only\r\ninstance of any animal I have ever known who seemed to be literally\r\nwithout a single habit, apparently without affection, without a temper\r\ngood or bad, with no wishes or desires except to be let alone to doze\r\naway his aimless life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHOW TO OBSERVE NATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is all the difference between taking a walk simply for exercise,\r\nfor some special errand, or to enjoy conversation with one's friends,\r\nand the sort of quiet observant stroll I am going to ask my kind readers\r\nto take with me to-day.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful world is full of wonders of every kind, full of evidences\r\nof the Great Creator's wisdom and skill in adapting each created thing\r\nto its special purpose. The whole realm of nature is meant, I believe,\r\nto _speak to us_, to teach us lessons in parables--to lead our hearts\r\nupward to God who made us and fitted us also for our special place in\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth Psalm David speaks of the two great books God has\r\ngiven us for our instruction. In the first six verses he speaks of the\r\nteachings of the book of nature and the rest of the Psalm deals with the\r\nwritten Word of God.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge and read the Scriptures as the book which reveals the\r\nwill of God and His wondrous works for the welfare of mankind, but how\r\nmany fail to give any time or thought to reading the book of nature!\r\nThousands may travel and admire beautiful scenery, and derive a certain\r\namount of pleasure from nature, just glancing at each object, but really\r\nobserving nothing, and thus failing to learn any of the lessons this\r\nworld's beauty is intended to teach, they might almost as well have\r\nstayed at home save for the benefit of fresh air and change of scene.\r\nThe habit of minute and careful observation is seldom taught in\r\nchildhood, and is not very likely to be gained in later life when the\r\nmind is filled with other things. Yet if natural objects are presented\r\nattractively to the young, how quickly they are interested! Question\r\nafter question is asked, and unconsciously a vast amount of information\r\nmay be conveyed to an intelligent child's mind by a simple, happy little\r\nchat about some bird or insect. This is _admirably_ shown in a chapter\r\non Education in the Life of Mrs. Sewell. I would strongly urge every\r\nmother to read and follow the advice there given.\r\n\r\nWe will now start for our garden walk. We have not taken many steps\r\nbefore we are led to pause and inquire why there should be little\r\npatches of grey-looking mud in the small angles of the brickwork of the\r\nhouse. Opening one of the patches with a penknife we find a hollow cell,\r\nand in it some green caterpillars just alive but not able to crawl. Now\r\nI see that the cell is the work of one of the solitary mason wasps; she\r\nbrings the material, forms the cell, and when nearly finished lays her\r\negg at the bottom and provides these half-killed caterpillars as food\r\nfor the young grub when it is hatched, and by the time they are eaten\r\nthe grub becomes a pupa and then hatches into a young wasp to begin life\r\non its own account. One day I saw a bee go into a hole in the brickwork\r\nof the house, and getting my net I waited to capture it; after about\r\nfive minutes the bee came out and flew into the net. It proved to be a\r\nsolitary mason bee, and was doubtless forming a place to lay its egg,\r\nonly, unlike the wasp, she would give the young grub pollen from the\r\nstamens of flowers to feed upon instead of green caterpillars. I\r\nremember seeing a mass of clay which had been formed into a wasp's nest\r\nby one of the solitary species, under the flap of a pembroke table in an\r\nunused room. A maid in dusting lifted up the flap, and down fell a\r\nquantity of fine, dry mud with young grubs in it which would soon have\r\nhatched into wasps, and revealed their rather strange nesting-place. I\r\nhave in my collection a very interesting hornet's nest, which was being\r\nconstructed in the hollow of an old tree. I happened to notice a hornet\r\nfly into the opening, and, looking in, there was a small beginning of a\r\nnest. It hung from a kind of stalk and consisted of only eight cells,\r\neach having an egg at the bottom. I captured the two hornets, and though\r\nI watched for a long time no others ever came, so I imagine they were\r\nthe founders of what would have been a colony in due time.\r\n\r\nBut we have been kept a long time engaged with these mason wasps. Let us\r\nstart for our walk. As we take our way through the garden we cannot help\r\nnoticing the happy songs of the different birds, all in full activity\r\npreparing their nests, carolling to their mates or seeking food for the\r\nlittle ones. There is a loud tapping noise as we pass an old fir-tree,\r\nbut no bird is to be seen, so we go round to the other side and trace\r\nthe noise to a small hole near which a quantity of congealed turpentine\r\nshows that the bark has been pierced by a woodpecker and the sap is\r\noozing out. I rap outside the hole and in a minute the grey head of a\r\nnuthatch appears. He is evidently chiselling out a \"highly desirable\r\nresidence\" for his summer quarters in this cosy nook, and the hole being\r\nso small he will not need to get clay to reduce the size of the opening\r\nand plaster in his mate, which is said to be the curious habit of this\r\nbird. Do you see that hole about forty feet up the stem of the beech\r\nopposite? A nuthatch built there six years ago; I often watched him\r\ngoing in and out, and heard his peculiar cry as he brought food for his\r\nmate and her young ones. Next year that lodging was taken by a\r\nstarling, who reared a brood there. The year after the nuthatch had it,\r\nand then a jackdaw built there; and each year I always feel interested\r\nto see who the lodgers are going to be.\r\n\r\nWhen I was rearing the wild ducks already described, a weasel used often\r\nto be prowling near the coop, and when frightened retreated in this\r\ndirection. It happened one day I was walking softly on the grass and saw\r\nthe weasel playing and frisking at the root of that young tree; one\r\nseldom has such an opportunity of seeing it, for it is very shy and has\r\nwonderfully quick hearing. It was seeking about in the grass, leaping\r\nhere and there, snuffing the wind, with its snake-like, wicked-looking\r\nhead raised to see over the grass stems, and thus at last it caught\r\nsight of me, and in a second it darted into the hole you see there, and\r\nI thus learnt where he lived, but I have not been able to trace his\r\nhistory any further at present.\r\n\r\nDid you see that snake? We have many of them on the common, and they\r\noften cross my path in the garden. Happily there are not many of the\r\nvenomous kind: they are smaller than this one, and have a V-shaped mark\r\non the head. One day in August I was sitting by the open French window\r\nin the drawing-room when one of these harmless snakes came close to me,\r\nlooked up at me, putting its quivering little tongue in and out. I\r\nsuppose it decided that I could be trusted, for it glided in and coiled\r\nitself round upon my dress skirt and seemed to go to sleep. I let it\r\nstay a good while, but fearing some one might be frightened at seeing it\r\nthere, I reached my parasol and with the hooked handle softly took up\r\nthe snake and laid it on the grass-plat outside thinking it would go\r\naway--but no, it only turned round and came back and coiled itself up in\r\nthe same place. I found it did not mind being touched, so I stroked it\r\nand made it creep all its length through my hand--not a very pleasant\r\nsensation, but a curious experience rarely to be met with. When the\r\ncold, clammy creature had passed out of my hand it threw out a most\r\ndisgusting odour, of which I had often read. I imagine it was offended\r\nat my touching it and did this in self-defence. I had at last to carry\r\nit a long distance to ensure it should not return to the room again.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I was witness to the mode in which a snake pursues its\r\nvictim. A large frog leaped upon the gravel walk before the windows,\r\ncrying piteously like a child and taking rapid leaps; a moment after a\r\nlarge snake appeared swiftly pursuing the frog. At last it reached it,\r\nand gave it a bite which broke its back, and then, being alarmed, it\r\ndarted away amongst some rock-work, leaving the frog in a dying state.\r\n\r\nThis bank we are passing is a favourite winter retreat for female humble\r\nbees. Early in the autumn they begin to scoop out a little tunnel in\r\nthis grassy slope, and when it is deep enough to protect them from the\r\nfrost they retire into it, and pushing up the earth behind them close up\r\nthe entrance of the hole, and there lie dormant until the warmth of\r\nspring tempts them to come out. Then they may be found in great numbers\r\non the early sallow, and other tree-blossoms, recruiting their strength,\r\nwhile they seek a place in some hedge-bank wherein to found a new\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nThe Carder bee forms its nest on the ground and makes a roof of\r\ninterwoven moss, from which it takes its name. I once gathered the moss\r\nfrom such a nest by chance and saw the little mass of cells with honey\r\nin them. I went away, meaning to examine it more closely on my return,\r\nbut a crow in the apple-tree overhead chanced to spy the nest and made\r\noff with it in his beak before I could rescue the honey store of the\r\npoor little bees I had so unwittingly injured.\r\n\r\nThat old tree-stump is being gradually carried away by wasps. The wood\r\nis just sufficiently decayed to afford the material of which they make\r\ntheir nests. You see there are several wasps busily rasping pieces of\r\nthe rotten wood into convenient-sized morsels, which they can carry to\r\nthe nest, there to be masticated into the papery layers of which the\r\nouter walls of the nest are formed. This walk used to have a row of\r\ngrand old silver firs of great height, but each winter some of them have\r\nbeen blown down till only a few are left.\r\n\r\nSome years since I noticed at the root of one of them a pile of fine\r\nsawdust more than a foot high, and found that some wood wasps were\r\nbusily engaged in excavating the interior of the tree and forming\r\ntunnels in which to lay their eggs. I watched them for half an hour and\r\nfound that every half-minute a wasp went in at the aperture carrying a\r\nblue-bottle or some kind of fly in its mandibles. Next day I took a\r\nfriend to see the wasps, and while watching them the wind caused the\r\nimmense tree-stem to sway to and fro from its base as if in the act of\r\nfalling, and on examination we found it was only held in its place by a\r\nsmall portion of root, and though the branches were green, it must have\r\nbeen hollow and dead inside, which appears to be the way in which silver\r\nfirs decay, and the wasps had found it out and made a delightful home in\r\nthe rotten wood. With some difficulty the great tree was safely taken\r\ndown, and then it was a most curious sight to see the endless chambers\r\nand galleries made in the stem, all tenanted by young wasp-grubs and\r\nhalf-dead flies; and all the summer they were being hatched in countless\r\nnumbers. The view over our common is lovely from this point; it is\r\ngolden with rich yellow gorse, giving cover to innumerable rabbits,\r\nwhich find their way into our garden in spite of wire fences and all\r\nthat the gardener can do to keep them out. One clever little mother\r\nrabbit made her burrow deep down in a heap of sawdust close to the\r\nstable. My coachman put his arm down to the bottom of the hole and\r\nbrought out a little grey furred creature, kicking and screaming with\r\nwonderful vigour in spite of its tender years. The nest was allowed to\r\nremain, and in a few days the mother removed her brood to a hole at the\r\nroot of a bushy stone-pine, where the little ones frisked in and out and\r\nlooked so pretty that I was won over to allow them to stay, and, by\r\nnetting round the tree, we formed a miniature warren for the young\r\nfamily; but I fear that in course of time we may bitterly repent this\r\nstep, and the numbers may increase to such an extent that pinks and\r\nlobelia may become things of the past and the rabbit warren may have to\r\nbe abolished.\r\n\r\nA fox is sometimes seen and hunted in these parts. One surprised me by\r\nleaping upon the window-sill and looking into the drawing-room. At first\r\nI could not think what it was. It had been dug out of its hole; its fur\r\nwas muddy and torn, its eyes piteous in their expression, and when it\r\nran slowly on I saw it was very lame. I ran to the window to let it in,\r\nbut though it leaped up to each window in succession, they all happened\r\nto be shut, and I was quite grieved to think the poor, weary creature\r\ncould find no shelter. I am no admirer of field-sports. I think they\r\ngive rise to the utmost cruelty to the creatures hunted and shot, to the\r\nhorses and dogs employed; and to witness torture inflicted on\r\nunoffending animals cannot but have a debasing effect on the human mind.\r\nWhen once any one has seen the anguish of a deer, a fox, or hare, at the\r\nend of the race, there can be no question about the cruelty of the\r\nproceeding, and to one who loves every created thing as I do, it gives\r\nthe keenest pain to know how much suffering of this kind goes on during\r\nthe hunting season.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I cannot resist quoting and strongly endorsing the\r\nfollowing lament by Mr. H. Stacy Marks, R.A., as to the way in which\r\nbirds are too frequently treated by the public at large: \"Many people\r\nregarding birds in but three aspects--as things to be either eaten,\r\nshot, or worn.... No natural history of a bird is complete without\r\nrecording where the last specimen was shot; and should a rare bird visit\r\nour shores, the hospitality which we accord to the foreign refugee is\r\ndenied, and it is bound to be the victim of powder and shot. The fashion\r\nof wearing birds or their plumage as part of ladies' attire, threatens\r\nto exterminate many beautiful species, such as the humming-birds of\r\nSouth America, the glossy starlings of Africa, and the glorious Impeyan\r\npheasant of the Himalayas, with many other species.\"]\r\n\r\nThere goes a cuckoo, with quite a flight of small birds pursuing him\r\nwherever he goes.\r\n\r\nSmall birds seem to have an intense hatred of jays and cuckoos, and will\r\noften fly at them in the nesting season, giving them no peace till they\r\ndrive them out of the garden, knowing full well that their own broods\r\nare often devoured by the jay, and that the cuckoo has designs upon the\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are some distance from home, I can show you one of my own\r\nbees on this furze blossom. I have a hive of Swiss, or Ligurian bees,\r\nwhich are said to be in some respects superior to the English species.\r\nThe honey is of excellent flavour, and the first year I had far more\r\nhoney from the Ligurian hive. I do not think any other hives of\r\nLigurians are kept within five miles, and, as you see, they have a band\r\nof bright yellow on the abdomen. I can always tell my own bees when I\r\nmeet with them in my walks on the common or in the lanes. I had a rather\r\ntrying adventure with these bees last May. One Sunday evening we were\r\njust starting for church, about half-past six, when my little niece ran\r\nin exclaiming that there was a great bunch of bees hanging on a branch\r\nnear the hives. I knew what had happened--my very irreverent bees had\r\nswarmed on this quiet Sunday evening, and they must be hived if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nMy bonnet was soon off and the bee-dress put on, and in five minutes the\r\nbees were secured and settled into a hive. We went to church and were\r\nnot even late, but--during the first prayer I heard ominous sounds of a\r\nfurious bee under my dress; it was, fortunately, a partly transparent\r\nmaterial, and glancing furtively about I saw my little friend under the\r\nskirt going up and down with an angry biz-z-z. Only the pocket-hole\r\ncould release him, so I held that safely in my hand all through the\r\nservice, lest the congregation might suffer the wrath of a furious bee,\r\nwhich in truth is no light matter, for in blind fury it will rush at the\r\nfirst person it meets and leave its sting in the face or hand. Happily I\r\nsucceeded in bringing the bee home again, and resolved to avoid hiving\r\nswarms before church-time in future.\r\n\r\nYou see under the drooping boughs of the fir-tree yonder an old stone\r\nbasin, well known to all the birds in the neighbourhood, for there they\r\nalways find a supply of fresh water and food of various kinds to suit\r\nall tastes. As it is opposite the dining-room window, it is very\r\ninteresting to see a tame jay and sundry squirrels enjoying the acorns\r\nwhich were collected for them last autumn and stored up so as to keep\r\nthe basin well supplied all through the winter and spring, until other\r\nfood should be plentiful. Finches, robins, and sparrows find wheat and\r\ncrumbs to their taste, and take their daily bath not without some\r\nsquabbling as to who shall have it first--a difficulty which is\r\nsometimes settled by a portly blackbird appearing on the scene and\r\nscattering the smaller folk, whilst he takes his early tubbing and sends\r\nup showers of spray in the process. Very pretty are the scenes on that\r\nsame stone basin when in early summer a mother bird brings her little\r\ntribe of downy, chirping babes, and feeds each little gaping mouth with\r\nsome suitable morsels from the store she finds there.\r\n\r\nA sheaf of corn in winter is also a great boon to the starved-out\r\nbirdies, when snow has long deprived them of their natural food, and the\r\nwater supply has to be often renewed on freezing days, for many a bird\r\ndies in winter from lack of water, all its usual supplies being frozen.\r\nThe tameness of birds in severe weather is a touching sign of their\r\ndistress, and a mute appeal to us to help them.\r\n\r\n          \"The fowls of heaven\r\n          Tam'd by the cruel season, crowd around\r\n          The winnowing store, and claim the little boon\r\n          Which Providence assigns them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to think that they seldom appeal in vain. \"Crumbs for the\r\nbirds\" are scattered by kindly little hands everywhere in winter, and in\r\nmany a house a pet sonsie little robin is a cherished visitor, always\r\nwelcome to his small share of the good things of this life.\r\n\r\nOur ramble might be indefinitely prolonged and still be full of interest\r\nand instruction, but in these simple remarks enough has been shown, I\r\ntrust, to lead many to _think_ and _observe_ closely every, even the\r\nminutest, thing that catches their attention whilst out for a ramble in\r\nlanes and fields, even a microscopic moss upon an old wall has been\r\nsuggestive of many lovely thoughts, with which I will conclude our\r\nramble and this chapter.\r\n\r\n   \"It was not all a tale of eld,\r\n    That fairies, who their revels held\r\n    By moonlight, in the greenwood shade\r\n    Their beakers of the moss-cups made.\r\n    The wondrous light which science burns\r\n    Reveals those lovely jewelled urns!\r\n    Fair lace-work spreads from roughest stems\r\n    And shows each tuft a mine of gems.\r\n        Voices from the silent sod,\r\n        Speaking of the Perfect God.\r\n\r\n    Fringeless, or fringed, and fringed again,\r\n    No single leaflet formed in vain;\r\n    What wealth of heavenly wisdom lies\r\n    Within one moss-cup's mysteries!\r\n    And few may know what silvery net,\r\n    Down in its mimic depths is set\r\n    To catch the rarest dews that fall\r\n    Upon the dry and barren wall.\r\n        Voices from the silent sod,\r\n        Speaking of the Perfect God.\"\r\n\r\n                                     L.

The girl is simply odious; but Mr. Buchanan is a poet--it\r\nwould seem sometimes _malgre lui_, in this instance it is _quand\r\nmeme_--and he dowers the worthless Effie with a rugged,\r\nhalf-misanthropic, steadfast lover, whose love, never rewarded, is\r\nproved by as great a sacrifice as fact or fiction has ever known, and\r\nwho is almost as striking a figure as Heathcliff in 'Wuthering\r\nHeights.'\"--_World_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WORKS BY JOSEPH CONRAD\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAN OUTCAST OF THE ISLANDS\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo., cloth_, 6s.\r\n\r\n     \"Subject to the qualifications thus disposed of (_vide_ first part\r\n     of notice), 'An Outcast of the Islands' is perhaps the finest piece\r\n     of fiction that has been published this year, as 'Almayer's Folly'\r\n     was one of the finest that was published in 1895.... Surely this is\r\n     real romance--the romance that is real. Space forbids anything but\r\n     the merest recapitulation of the other living realities of Mr.\r\n     Conrad's invention--of Lingard, of the inimitable Almayer, the\r\n     one-eyed Babalatchi, the Naturalist, of the pious Abdulla--all\r\n     novel, all authentic. Enough has been written to show Mr. Conrad's\r\n     quality. He imagines his scenes and their sequence like a master;\r\n     he knows his individualities and their hearts; he has a new and\r\n     wonderful field in this East Indian Novel of his.... Greatness is\r\n     deliberately written; the present writer has read and re-read his\r\n     two books, and after putting this review aside for some days to\r\n     consider the discretion of it, the word still stands.\"--_Saturday\r\n     Review._\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nALMAYER'S FOLLY\r\n\r\n_Second Edition.
