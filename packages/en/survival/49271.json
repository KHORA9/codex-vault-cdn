Now the\r\ninorganic earth, like an animal or plant, may be and is studied in three\r\nquite distinct ways, giving rise to three great divisions of geology,\r\nwhich, as will be seen, correspond closely to the main divisions of\r\nBiology.\r\n\r\nFirst, we may study the forces now operating upon and in the earth—the\r\ngeological agencies—such as the ocean and atmosphere, rivers, rain and\r\nfrosts, earthquakes, volcanoes, hot springs, etc., and observe the\r\nvarious effects which they produce. We are concerned here with the\r\ndynamics of the earth; and this is the great division of _dynamical\r\ngeology_, corresponding to physiology among the biological sciences.\r\n\r\nOr, second, instead of geological causes, we may study more particularly\r\ngeological effects, observing the different kinds of rocks and of\r\nrock-structure produced by the geological agencies, not only at the\r\npresent time, but also during past ages. This method of study gives us\r\nthe important division of _structural geology_, corresponding to anatomy\r\nand morphology.\r\n\r\nAll phenomena present two distinct and opposite aspects or phases which\r\nwe call _cause_ and _effect_; and so in dynamical and structural geology\r\nwe are really studying the opposite sides of essentially the same\r\nclasses of phenomena. In the first division we study the causes now in\r\noperation and observe their effects; and then, guided by the light of\r\nthe experience thus gained, we turn to the effects produced in the past\r\nand seek to refer them to their causes.\r\n\r\nThese two divisions together constitute what is properly known as\r\nphysiography; and they are both subordinate to the third great division\r\nof geology,—_historical geology_,—which corresponds to embryology.\r\n\r\nThe great object of the geologist is, by studying the geological\r\nformations in regular order, from the oldest up to the newest, to work\r\nout, in their proper sequence, the events which constitute the earth’s\r\nhistory; and dynamical and structural geology are merely introductory\r\nchapters, the alphabet, as it were, which must be learned before we are\r\nprepared to read understandingly the grand story of the geological\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nOur work in this short course will be limited to the first two\r\ndivisions,—_i.e._, to dynamical and structural geology. We will attempt,\r\nfirst, a general sketch of the forces now concerned in the formation of\r\nrocks and rock-structures; and after that we will study the composition\r\nand other characteristics of the common minerals and rocks.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this work, and its relations to the whole field of geology,\r\nare more clearly indicated by the following classification of the\r\ngeological sciences:—\r\n\r\n                {DYNAMICAL GEOLOGY    {_Physical Geology._\r\n                                      {_Chemical Geology._\r\n\r\n       GEOLOGY  {STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY   {_Mineralogy._\r\n                                      {_Petrography_ {Lithology.\r\n                                                     {Petrology.\r\n                {HISTORICAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nMany teachers will desire to fill in some of the details of the outline\r\nsketch presented in this Guide, and for this purpose the following works\r\nare especially recommended:—\r\n\r\n    ELEMENTS OF GEOLOGY. By Prof. Joseph Le Conte. 1882. D.\r\n        Appleton & Co., New York. Nearly 600 pages.\r\n\r\n    MANUAL OF GEOLOGY. By Prof. J. D. Dana. Third edition. 1880.\r\n        800 pages.\r\n\r\n    TEXT-BOOK OF GEOLOGY. By Prof. A. Geikie. 1882. Macmillan &\r\n        Co., London. Nearly 1000 pages.\r\n\r\nAs a reference-book for mineralogy, the following treatise is\r\nunsurpassed:—\r\n\r\n    TEXT-BOOK OF MINERALOGY. By Edward S. Dana. 1883. John Wiley\r\n        & Sons, New York.\r\n\r\nAnd, as an introduction to the study of minerals, and, through these, to\r\nthe study of rocks,—\r\n\r\n    FIRST LESSONS IN MINERALS. Science Guide No. XIII. By Mrs.\r\n        E. H. Richards.\r\n\r\ncannot be too highly recommended. Teachers will find this little primer\r\nof 46 pages invaluable with young children, and with all who have had no\r\nprevious training in chemistry.\r\n\r\nAs an admirable continuation of the work begun in these pages, teachers\r\nare referred to Professor Shaler’s “First Book in Geology.” In this our\r\nbrief sketch of the geological agencies is amplified and beautifully\r\nillustrated; and rarely have the wonderful stories of the river,\r\nocean-beach, glacier, and volcano been told so effectively. In the\r\nchapter on the history of life on the globe the main outlines of\r\nhistorical geology are skillfully brought within the comprehension of\r\nbeginners. The directions to teachers are fully in accord with the\r\nmodern methods and ideas, and are a very valuable feature of the book.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DYNAMICAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we think of the ocean with its waves, tides, and currents, of the\r\nwinds, and of the rain and snow, and the vast net-work of rivers to\r\nwhich they give rise, we realize that the energy or force manifested\r\nupon the earth’s surface resides chiefly in the _air_ and _water_—in the\r\nearth’s fluid envelope and not in its solid crust. And it would be an\r\neasy matter to show that, with the exception of the tidal waves and\r\ncurrents, which of course are due chiefly to the attraction of the moon,\r\nnearly all this energy is merely the transformed heat of the sun. Now\r\nthe air and water are two great geological agencies, and therefore the\r\ngeological effects which they produce are traceable back to the sun.\r\n\r\nOrganic matter is another important geological agent; but all are\r\nfamiliar with the generalization that connects the energy exhibited by\r\nevery form of life with the sun; and, besides, it is scarcely necessary\r\nto allude to the obvious fact that all animals and plants, so far at\r\nleast as any display of energy is concerned, are merely differentiated\r\nportions of the earth’s fluid envelope. And so, if space permitted, it\r\nmight be shown that, with the exception of the tides, nearly every form\r\nof force manifested upon the earth’s surface has its origin in the sun.\r\n\r\nOf this trio of geological agencies operating upon the earth’s surface\r\nand vitalized by the sun—_water_, _air_, and _organic matter_—the water\r\nis by far the most important, and so it is common to call these\r\ncollectively the aqueous agencies. Hence we have _solar agencies_ and\r\n_aqueous agencies_ as synonymous terms.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous agencies include, on one side, _air_ and _water_, or\r\n_inorganic_ agencies; and, on the other, _animals_ and _plants_, or\r\n_organic_ agencies.\r\n\r\nLet us notice briefly the operation of these, beginning with the air and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          I. AQUEOUS AGENCIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n               1. _Air and Water, or Inorganic Agencies._\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL EROSION.—Attention is invited first to the specimens numbered\r\n1, 2, 3, and 4. No. 1 is a sound, fresh piece of the rather common rock,\r\ndiabase; and those who are acquainted with minerals will recognize that\r\nthe light-colored grains in the rock are feldspar, and the dark, augite.\r\nThis specimen came from a depth in the quarry, and has not been exposed\r\nto the action of the weather.\r\n\r\nThe second specimen differs from the first, apparently, as much as\r\npossible; and yet, except in being somewhat finer grained, it was\r\noriginally of precisely similar composition and appearance. In fact, it\r\nis a portion of the same rock, but a _weathered_ portion. In this we can\r\nno longer recognize the feldspar and augite as such, but both these\r\nminerals are very much changed, while in the place of a strong, hard\r\nrock we have an incoherent friable mass, which is, externally at least,\r\neasily crushed to powder; and with the next step in the weathering, as\r\nwe may readily observe in the natural ledges, the rock is completely\r\ndisintegrated, forming a loose earth or soil.\r\n\r\nWe have two examples of such natural powders in the specimens numbered 3\r\nand 4; and by washing these (especially the finer one, No. 4) with\r\nwater, we can prove that they consist of an impalpable substance which\r\nwe may call clay, and angular grains which we may call sand. The\r\nsand-grains are really portions of the feldspar not yet entirely changed\r\nto clay.\r\n\r\nThus we learn that the result of the exposure of this hard rock to the\r\nweather is that it is reduced to the condition of sand and clay. What we\r\nmean especially by the weather are _moisture_ and certain constituents\r\nof the air, particularly _carbon dioxide_.\r\n\r\nThe action of the weather on the rocks is almost entirely chemical. With\r\na very few exceptions, the principal minerals of which rocks are\r\ncomposed, such as feldspar, hornblende, augite, and mica, are silicates,\r\n_i.e._, consist of silicic acid or silica combined with various bases,\r\nespecially aluminum, magnesium, iron, calcium, potassium, and sodium.\r\n\r\nNow the silica does not hold all these bases with equal strength; but\r\ncarbon dioxide, in the presence of moisture, is able to take the sodium,\r\npotassium, calcium, and magnesium away from the silica in the form of\r\ncarbonates, which, being soluble, are carried away by the rain-water.\r\n\r\nThe silicate of aluminum, with more or less iron, takes on water at the\r\nsame time, and remains behind as a soft, impalpable powder, which is\r\ncommon clay.\r\n\r\nIn the case of our diabase, continued exposure to the weather would\r\nreduce the whole mass to clay. But other rocks contain grains of quartz,\r\na hard mineral which cannot be decomposed, and it always forms sand.\r\nCertain classes of rocks, too, such as the limestones and some\r\niron-ores, are completely dissolved by water holding carbon dioxide in\r\nsolution, and nothing is left to form soil, except usually a small\r\nproportion of insoluble impurities like sand or clay.\r\n\r\nLet us see next how these agents of decay get at the rocks. Neither\r\nwater nor air can penetrate the solid rock or mineral to any\r\nconsiderable extent, so that practically the action is limited to\r\nsurfaces, and whatever multiplies surfaces must favor decomposition.\r\n\r\nFirst, we have the upper surface of the rock where it is bare, but more\r\nespecially where it is covered with soil, for there it is always wet.\r\n\r\nAll rocks are naturally divided by joints into blocks, which are\r\nfrequently more or less regular, and often of quite small size. Water\r\nand air penetrate into these cracks and decompose the surfaces of the\r\nblocks, and thus the field of their operations is enormously extended.\r\nThese rock-blocks sometimes show very beautifully the progress of the\r\ndecomposing agents from the outside inward by concentric layers or\r\nshells of rotten material, which, in the larger blocks, often envelop a\r\nnucleus of the unaltered rock.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe, too, that these concentric lines of decay\r\ncut off the angles of the original blocks, so that the undecomposed\r\nnucleus, when it is found, is approximately spherical instead of\r\ncuboidal. Both these points are well illustrated by specimen No. 2; for\r\nalthough now nearly spherical, it was originally perfectly angular, and\r\nhas become rounded by the peeling off, in concentric layers, of the\r\ndecomposed material, and in most cases several of these layers are\r\ndistinctly visible, like the coats of an onion. But by stripping these\r\noff we should discover, in all the larger balls at least, a solid,\r\nspheroidal nucleus, while in the smaller balls the decomposition has\r\npenetrated to the centre.\r\n\r\nIn the rocks also we find many imperfect joints and minute cracks. In\r\ncold countries these are extended and widened by the expansive power of\r\nfreezing water, and thus the surfaces of decomposition become constantly\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nNearly all rocks suffer this chemical decomposition when exposed to the\r\nweather, but in some the decay goes on much faster than in others.\r\nDiabase is one of the rocks which decay most readily; while granite is,\r\namong common rocks, one of those that resist decay most effectually.\r\n\r\nThe caverns which are so large and numerous in most limestone countries\r\nare a splendid example of the solvent action of meteoric waters, being\r\nformed entirely by the dissolving out of the limestone by the water\r\ncirculating through the joint cracks. The process must go on with\r\nextreme slowness at first, when the joints are narrow, and more rapidly\r\nas they are widened and more water is admitted. We get some idea, too,\r\nof the magnitude of the results accomplished by these silent and\r\nunobtrusive agencies when we reflect that almost all the loose earth and\r\nsoil covering the solid rocks are simply the insoluble residue which\r\ncarbon dioxide and water cannot remove. In low latitudes, where a warm\r\nclimate accelerates the decay of the rocks, the soil is usually from 50\r\nto 300 feet deep.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL EROSION.—_On the edge of the land._—Let us trace next the\r\n_mechanical_ action of water and air upon the land. First we will\r\nconsider the _edge_ of the land, where it is washed by the waves of the\r\nsea. Whoever has been on the shore must have noticed that the sand along\r\nthe water’s edge is kept in constant motion by the ebb and flow of the\r\nsurf.\r\n\r\nWhere the beach is composed of gravel or shingle the motion is evident\r\nto the _ear_ as well as the eye; and when the surf is strong, the\r\nrattling and grinding of the pebbles as they are rolled up and down the\r\nbeach develops into a roar.\r\n\r\nThe constant shifting of the grains of sand, pebbles, and stones is, of\r\ncourse, attended by innumerable collisions, which are the cause of the\r\nnoise. Now it is practically impossible, as we may easily prove by\r\nexperiment, to knock or rub two pieces of stone together, at least so as\r\nto produce much noise, without abrading their surfaces; small particles\r\nare detached, and sand and dust are formed.\r\n\r\nThat this abrasion actually occurs in the case of the moving sand is\r\nmost beautifully shown by the sandblast. We are to conclude, then, that\r\nevery time a pebble, large or small, is rolled up or down the beach it\r\nbecomes smaller, and some sand and dust or clay are formed which are\r\ncarried off by the water.\r\n\r\nBut what are the pebbles originally? This question is not difficult. A\r\nlittle observation on the beach shows us that the pebbles are not all\r\nequally round and smooth, but many are more or less angular. And we soon\r\nsee that it is possible to select a series showing all gradations\r\nbetween the most perfectly rounded forms and angular fragments of rock\r\nthat are only slightly abraded on the corners. The three principal\r\nmembers of such a series are shown in specimens 5, 6, and 7 from the\r\nbeach on Marblehead Neck; but equally instructive specimens can be\r\nobtained at many other points on our coast. It is also observable that\r\nthe well-rounded pebbles are much smaller on the average than the\r\nangular blocks.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts we draw the legitimate inference that the pebbles were\r\nall originally angular, and that the same abrasion which diminishes\r\ntheir size makes them round and smooth.\r\n\r\nA little reflection, too, shows that the rounding of the angular\r\nfragments is a natural and necessary result of their mutual collisions;\r\nfor the angles are at the same time their weakest and most exposed\r\npoints, and must wear off faster than the flat or concave surfaces.\r\n\r\nHaving traced each pebble back to a larger angular rock-fragment, the\r\nquestion arises, Whence come these angular blocks?\r\n\r\nBehind our gravel-beach, or at its end, we have usually a cliff of\r\nrocks. As we approach this it is distinctly observable that the angular\r\npebbles are more numerous, larger, and more angular; and a little\r\nobservation shows that these are simply the blocks produced by jointing,\r\nand that the cliff is entirely composed of them. In other words, our\r\ncliff is a mass of natural masonry, which chemical agencies, the frost,\r\nand the sea are gradually disintegrating and removing. As soon as the\r\nblocks are brought within reach of the surf their mutual collisions make\r\nthem rounder and smaller; and small round pebbles, sand, and clay are\r\nthe final result.\r\n\r\nFor a more complete account of the formation of pebbles, teachers are\r\nreferred to the first or introductory number of this series of guides,\r\nby Prof. Hyatt, “About Pebbles.”\r\n\r\nWhere the waves can drive the shingle directly against the base of the\r\ncliff, this is gradually ground away in the same manner as the loose\r\nstones themselves, sometimes forming a cavern of considerable depth, but\r\nalways leaving a smooth, hard surface, which is very characteristic, and\r\ncontrasts strongly with the upper portion of the cliff, which is acted\r\non only by the rain and frost. A good example of such a pebble-carved\r\ncliff may be seen behind the beach on the sea-ward side of Marblehead\r\nNeck.\r\n\r\nThe sea acts within very narrow limits vertically, a few feet or a few\r\nyards at most; but the coast-lines of the globe (including inland lakes\r\nand seas) have an aggregate length of more than 150,000 miles. Hence it\r\nis easy to see that the amount of solid rock ground to powder in the\r\nmill of the ocean-beach annually must be very considerable.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL EROSION.—_On the surface of the land._—I next ask attention\r\nto the _mechanical_ action of water upon the _surface_ of the land.\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar fact that after heavy rains the roadside rills carry\r\nalong much sand and clay (which we know have been produced by the\r\nprevious action of chemical forces), and also frequently small pebbles\r\nor gravel. It is easy to show that in all important respects the rill\r\ndiffers in size only from brooks and rivers; and the former afford us\r\nfine models of the systems of valleys worn out during the lapse of ages\r\nby rivers. The turbidity of rivers is often very evident, and in shallow\r\nstreams we can sometimes see the pebbles rolled along by the current.\r\n\r\nNow here, just as on the beach, the collisions of rock-fragments are\r\nattended by mutual abrasion, sand and clay are formed, and the fragments\r\nbecome smaller and rounder. Our series of pebbles from the beach might\r\nbe matched perfectly among the river-gravel. In mountain streams\r\nespecially we may often observe that pebbles of a particular kind of\r\nrock become more numerous, larger, and more angular as we proceed up\r\nstream, until we reach the solid ledge from which they were derived,\r\nshowing the same gradation as the beach pebbles when followed back to\r\nthe parent cliff.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles, however, not only grind each other, but also the solid\r\nrocks which form the bed of the streams in many places, and these are\r\ngradually worn away. When the rocky bed is uneven and the water is\r\nswift, pebbles collect in hollows where eddies are formed, by which they\r\nare kept whirling and turning, and the hollow is deepened to a pot-hole,\r\nwhile the pebbles, the river’s tools, are worn out at the same time.\r\n\r\nBy these observations we learn not only that running water carries away\r\nsand and clay already formed, but that it also has great power of\r\ngrinding down hard rocks to sand and clay. Of course the pulverized rock\r\nalways moves in the same direction as the stream which carries it; and,\r\nin a certain sense, all streams run in one direction, viz., toward the\r\nsea. Therefore the constant tendency of the rain falling upon the land\r\nis to break up the rocks by chemical and mechanical action and transport\r\nthe débris to the sea.\r\n\r\nRivers, as we all know, are continually uniting to form larger and\r\nlarger streams; and thus the drainage of a wide area sometimes, as in\r\nthe case of the Mississippi Valley, reaches the sea through a single\r\nmouth. By careful measurements made at the mouth of the Mississippi it\r\nhas been shown that the 20,000,000,000,000 cubic feet of water\r\ndischarged into the Gulf of Mexico annually carries with it no less than\r\n7,500,000,000 cubic feet of sand, clay, and dissolved mineral matter;\r\nand this, spread over the whole Mississippi basin, would form a layer a\r\nlittle more than 1/5000 of a foot in thickness. So that we may conclude\r\nthat the surface of the continent is being cut down on the average about\r\n_one foot_ in _five thousand_ years.\r\n\r\nWe can only allude in passing to the very important geological action of\r\nwater in the solid state, as in glaciers and icebergs. The moisture\r\nprecipitated from the atmosphere, and falling as rain, makes ordinary\r\nrivers; but falling in the form of snow in cold regions, where more snow\r\nfalls than is melted, the excess accumulates and is gradually compacted\r\nto ice, which, like water, yields to the enormous pressure of its own\r\nmass and flows toward lower levels. When the ice-river reaches the sea\r\nit breaks off in huge blocks, which float away as icebergs. Moving ice,\r\nlike moving water, is a powerful agent of erosion; and the glacial marks\r\nor scratches observable upon the ledges everywhere in the Northern\r\nStates and Canada attest the magnitude of the ice-action at a\r\ncomparatively recent period.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed incidentally the powerful disintegrating action\r\nof water where it freezes in the joints and pores of the rocks; and it\r\nis probable that it thus facilitates the destruction of the rocks in\r\ncold countries nearly as much as the higher temperature and greater\r\nrain-fall do in warm countries.\r\n\r\nOur observations up to this point show us that _erosion_, by which we\r\nmean the breaking up by chemical and mechanical action of the rocks of\r\nthe land and the transportation of the débris into the sea, is one great\r\nresult accomplished by the inorganic aqueous agencies.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL DEPOSITION.—Next let us notice what becomes of all this vast\r\namount of clay, sand, and gravel after it is washed into the ocean. By\r\ntaking up a glass of turbid water from our roadside rill, and observing\r\nthat as soon as the water is undisturbed the sand and clay begin to\r\nsettle, we learn that the solid matter is held in suspension by the\r\nmotion of the water. But it does not remain in suspension long after\r\nbeing washed into the sea, for otherwise the sea would, in the course of\r\ntime, become turbid for long distances from shore; and it is a\r\nwell-known fact that the sea-water is usually clear and free from\r\nsensible turbidity close along shore and even near the mouths of large\r\nrivers, while at a distance of only 50 or 100 miles we find the\r\ntransparency of the central ocean.\r\n\r\nPutting these facts together, we see that the ocean, nothwithstanding\r\nthe ceaseless and often violent undulations of its surface, must be as a\r\nwhole a vast body of still water; and to the reflecting mind the almost\r\nperfect tranquillity of the ocean is one of its most impressive\r\nfeatures. For it is in striking contrast, in this respect, with the more\r\nmobile aerial ocean above it.\r\n\r\nWe have got hold, now, of two facts of great geological importance: (1)\r\nThe débris washed off the land by waves and rivers into the still water\r\nof the ocean very soon settles to the bottom; and (2) it nearly all\r\nsettles on that part of the ocean-floor near the land.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have in view the second great office of the inorganic aqueous\r\nagencies,—deposition, the counterpart or complement of erosion.\r\n\r\nThe land is the great theatre of erosion and the sea of deposition; the\r\nrocks which are constantly wasting away on the former are as constantly\r\nrenewed in the latter.\r\n\r\nWe will now observe the process of deposition a little more closely.\r\nEach of these two bottles contains the same amount of fine yellow clay,\r\nbut in one the water is fresh, and in the other it is salt. At the\r\nbeginning of the lesson, as you may have observed, I brought the clay in\r\nboth bottles into suspension by violent agitation, and since then they\r\nhave remained undisturbed. The main point is that the salt water has\r\nbecome quite clear, while the fresh water is still distinctly turbid,\r\nshowing that the salt favors the rapid deposition of the clay. At the\r\nsecond lecture, a week later, these two bottles, yet undisturbed, were\r\nexhibited, and the fresh water seen to be still sensibly turbid. The\r\nfact is, the clay is not held in suspension wholly by the _motion_ of\r\nthe water; but, just as in the case of dust in the atmosphere, a small\r\nportion of the medium is condensed around or adheres to each solid\r\nparticle, _i.e._, each clay particle in our experiment has an atmosphere\r\nof water which moves with it and buoys it up. Now the effect of the salt\r\nis to diminish the adhesion of the water to the particles, _i.e._, to\r\ndiminish their atmospheres, and consequently their buoyancy. The\r\ndiminished adhesion of the salt water is well shown by the smaller drops\r\nwhich it forms on a glass rod.\r\n\r\nThe geological importance of this principle is very great; for it is\r\nundoubtedly largely to the saltness of the sea that we owe its\r\ntransparency, and the fact that the fine, clayey sediment from the land,\r\nlike the coarse, is deposited near the shore.\r\n\r\nThis bottle of fresh water contains some fine gravel, coarse sand, fine\r\nsand, and clay. By agitating the water, all this material is brought\r\ninto suspension. Now, suddenly placing the bottle in a state of rest, we\r\nobserve that the gravel falls to the bottom almost instantly, followed\r\nquickly by the coarse sand, and very soon afterward by the fine sand;\r\nand then there appears to be a pause, the fine particles of clay all\r\nremain in suspension; but finally, when the water is quite motionless,\r\nthey begin to settle; they fall very slowly, however, and the water will\r\nnot be clear for hours.\r\n\r\nThis is a very instructive experiment. We learn from it:\r\n\r\nFirst, that the power of the water to hold particles in suspension is\r\ninversely proportional to the size of the particles;\r\n\r\nSecond, that all materials deposited in water are assorted according to\r\nsize;\r\n\r\nThird, and this is one of the most important facts in geology, all\r\nwater-deposited sediments are arranged in horizontal layers, _i.e._, are\r\nstratified. And we have now traced to its conclusion, though very\r\nbriefly, the process of the formation of one great division of\r\n_stratified_ rocks,—the _mechanically-formed_ or _fragmental_ rocks.\r\nThese are so called because the clay, sand, and gravel are, in every\r\ninstance, fragments of pre-existing rocks; and because the formation,\r\ntransportation, and especially the _deposition_ of these fragments, are\r\nthe work chiefly or entirely of mechanical forces.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL DEPOSITION.—It is a well-known fact that the sea holds in\r\nsolution vast amounts of common salt as well as many other substances;\r\nand analyses of river-waters show that dissolved minerals derived from\r\nthe chemical decomposition of the rocks of the land are being constantly\r\ncarried into the sea.\r\n\r\nPortions of the sea which are cut off from the main body, and which are\r\ngradually drying up, like the Great Salt Lake, Dead Sea, and Caspian\r\nSea, become saturated solutions of the various dissolved minerals, and\r\nthese are slowly deposited. This process is very nicely illustrated\r\nalong our shores in summer, where, during storms, salt-water spray is\r\nthrown above the reach of the tides, and, collecting in hollows in the\r\nrocks, gradually dries up, leaving behind a crust of salt.\r\n\r\nWhen the sea lays down matter which it held in _suspension_, we call the\r\nprocess _mechanical_ deposition, and the result is _mechanically_-formed\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nBut when it lays down matter which it held in _solution_, we call the\r\nprocess _chemical_ deposition, and the result is _chemically_-formed\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe principal substances which the sea deposits chemically are common\r\nsalt, forming beds of rock-salt; sulphate of calcium, forming beds of\r\ngypsum; carbonate of calcium, forming beds of limestone; and the double\r\ncarbonate of calcium and magnesium, forming beds of dolomite.\r\n\r\nInorganic deposition, like inorganic erosion, is both chemical and\r\nmechanical.\r\n\r\n\r\n             2. _Animals and Plants, or Organic Agencies._\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the consideration of the _organic_ agencies. And I will\r\nmerely allude in passing to the vast importance of the fossil organic\r\nremains found in the stratified rocks as marks by which to determine the\r\nrelative ages of the formations.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _destruction_ of rocks—_erosion_—plants and animals are\r\nalmost powerless; but in the role of _rock-makers_ they play a very\r\nimportant part, being very efficient agents of _deposition_.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF COALS AND BITUMENS.—Specimen No. 8 is an example of peat\r\nfrom the vicinity of Boston; but just as good specimens may be obtained\r\nin thousands of places in this and other States.\r\n\r\nThe general physical conditions under which peat is formed are familiar\r\nfacts. We require simply low, level land, covered with a thin sheet of\r\nwater and abundant vegetation; in other words, a marsh or swamp. If\r\nplants decay on the dry land, the decomposition is complete; they are\r\nburned up by the oxygen of the air to _carbon dioxide_ and _water_ just\r\nas surely as if they had been thrown into a furnace, though less\r\nrapidly, and nothing is returned to the soil but what had been taken\r\nfrom it by the plants during their growth. But if the plants decay under\r\nwater, as in a peat-marsh or bog, the decay is incomplete, and most of\r\nthe carbon of the wood is left behind. Now, if this incomplete\r\ncombustion of vegetable tissues takes place in a charcoal-pit, where the\r\nwood is out of contact with air from being covered with earth, we call\r\nthe carbonaceous product charcoal; but if under the water of a marsh, in\r\nNature’s laboratory, we call the product peat. Peat is simply a natural\r\ncharcoal; and, just as in ordinary charcoal, its vegetable origin is\r\nalways perfectly evident. But when the deposit becomes thicker, and\r\nespecially when it is buried under thick formations of other rocks, like\r\nsand and clay, the great pressure consolidates the peat; it becomes\r\ngradually more mineralized and shining, shows the vegetable tissues less\r\ndistinctly, becomes more nearly pure carbon, and we call it in\r\nsuccession lignite, bituminous coal, and anthracite.\r\n\r\nThis is, briefly, the way in which all varieties of coal, as well as the\r\nmore solid kinds of bitumen, like asphaltum, are formed. But the lighter\r\nforms of bitumen, such as petroleum and naphtha, are derived mainly, if\r\nnot entirely, from the partial decomposition of animal tissues. These,\r\nit is well known, decay much more readily than vegetable tissues; and\r\nthe water of an ordinary marsh or lake contains sufficient oxygen for\r\ntheir complete and rapid decomposition. In the deeper parts of the\r\nocean, however, the conditions are very different, for recent researches\r\nhave shown, contrary to the old idea, that the deep sea holds an\r\nabundant fauna. All grades of animal life, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, have need of a constant supply of oxygen. On the land vegetation\r\nis constantly returning to the air the oxygen consumed by animals, but\r\nin the abysses of the ocean vegetable life is scarce or wanting; and\r\nhence it must result that over these greater than continental areas\r\ncountless myriads of animals are living habitually on short rations of\r\noxygen, and in water well charged with carbon dioxide, the product of\r\nanimal respiration. As a consequence, when these animals die their\r\ntissues do not find the oxygen essential for their perfect\r\ndecomposition, and in the course of time become buried, in a\r\nhalf-decayed state, in the ever-increasing sediments of the ocean-floor.\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe that an abundance of organic matter decaying\r\nunder water is not the only condition essential to the formation of beds\r\nof coal and bitumen; for this condition is realized in the luxuriant\r\ngrowth of sea-weeds fringing the coast in every quarter of the globe;\r\nand yet coals and bitumens are rarely of sea-shore origin. These organic\r\nproducts, even under the most favorable circumstances, accumulate with\r\nextreme slowness; far more slowly, as a rule, than the ordinary\r\nmechanical sediments, like sand and clay, with which they are mixed, and\r\nin which they are often completely lost. Consequently, although the\r\ndeposition of the carbonized remains of plants and animals is taking\r\nplace in nearly all seas, lakes, and marshes, it is only in those places\r\nwhere there is little or no mechanical sediment that they can\r\npredominate so as to build up beds pure enough to be called coal or\r\nbitumen. In all other cases we get merely more or less carbonaceous sand\r\nor clay. Now these especially favorable localities will manifestly not\r\nbe often found along the seashore, where we have strewn the sand and\r\nclay brought down by rivers or washed off the land directly by the\r\never-active surf; but they must exist in the central portions of the\r\nocean, where there is almost no mechanical sediment and yet an abundance\r\nof life, and in swamps and marshes, where there is scarcely sufficient\r\nwater to cover the vegetation, and no waves or currents to wash down the\r\nsoil from the surrounding hills.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF IRON-ORES.—The iron-ores are another class of rocks which\r\nare formed only through the agency of organic matter. Iron is an\r\nabundant and wide-spread element in the earth’s crust, and, but for the\r\nintervention of life, we might say that, while there is iron everywhere,\r\nthere is not much of it in any one place, since it is originally very\r\nthinly diffused. All rocks and soils contain iron, but it is mainly in\r\nthe form of the peroxide, in which state it is entirely insoluble, and\r\nhence cannot be soaked out of the soil by the rain-water and\r\nconcentrated by the evaporation of the water at lower levels in ponds\r\nand marshes, as a soluble substance like salt would be. If carried off\r\nwith the sand and clay, by the mechanical action of water, it remains\r\nuniformly mixed with them, and there is no tendency to its separation\r\nand concentration so as to form a true iron-ore.\r\n\r\nBut what water cannot do alone is accomplished very readily when the\r\nwater is aided by decaying organic matter, which is always hungry for\r\noxygen, being, in the language of the chemist, a powerful reducing\r\nagent. The soil, in most places, has a superficial stratum of vegetable\r\nmould or half-decayed vegetation. The rainwater percolates through this\r\nand dissolves more or less of the organic matter, which is thus carried\r\ndown into the sand and clay beneath and brought in contact with the\r\nferric oxide, from which it takes a certain proportion of oxygen,\r\nreducing the ferric to the ferrous oxide. At the same time the\r\nvegetation is burned up by the oxygen thus obtained, forming carbon\r\ndioxide, which immediately combines with the ferrous oxide, forming\r\ncarbonate of iron, which, being soluble under these conditions, is\r\ncarried along by the water as it gradually finds its way by subterranean\r\ndrainage to the bottom of the valley and emerges in a swamp or marsh.\r\n\r\nHere one of two things will happen: If the marsh contains little or no\r\ndecaying vegetation, then as soon as the ferrous carbonate brought down\r\nfrom the hills is exposed to the air it is decomposed, the carbon\r\ndioxide escapes, and the iron, taking on oxygen from the air, returns to\r\nits original ferric condition; and being then quite insoluble, it is\r\ndeposited as a loose, porous, earthy mass, commonly known as\r\nbog-iron-ore, which becomes gradually more solid and finally even\r\ncrystalline through the subsequent action of heat and pressure. When\r\nfirst deposited, the ferric oxide is combined with water or hydrated,\r\nand is then known as limonite (specimen No. 12); at a later period the\r\nwater is expelled, and we call the ore hematite (specimen No. 13); and\r\nat a still later age it loses part of its oxygen, becomes magnetic and\r\nmore crystalline, and is then known as magnetite (specimen No. 14). Thus\r\nit is seen that the iron-ores, as we pass from bog-limonite to\r\nmagnetite, form a natural series similar to and parallel with that\r\nafforded by the coals as we pass from peat to graphite.\r\n\r\nIf the drainage from the hills is into a marsh containing an abundance\r\nof decaying vegetation, _i.e._, if peat is forming there, the ferrous\r\ncarbonate, in the presence of the more greedy organic matter, will be\r\nunable to obtain oxygen from the air; and as the evaporation of the\r\nwater goes on, it will sooner or later become saturated with this salt,\r\nand the latter will be deposited. Here we find an explanation of a fact\r\noften observed by geologists, viz., that the carbonate iron-ores are\r\nusually associated with beds of coal.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the iron-ores, like that of the coals and bitumens, is\r\na slow process; and the ores, like the coals, etc., will be pure only\r\nwhere there is a complete absence of mechanical sediment, a condition\r\nthat is realized most nearly in marshes.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF LIMESTONE, DIATOMACEOUS EARTH, ETC.—Marine animals take\r\nfrom the sea-water certain mineral substances, especially silica and\r\ncarbonate of calcium, to form their skeletons. Silica is used only by\r\nthe lowest organisms, such as Radiolaria, Sponges, and the minute\r\nunicellular plants, Diatoms. The principal animals secreting carbonate\r\nof calcium are Corals and Mollusks. These hard parts of the organisms\r\nremain undissolved after death; and over portions of the ocean-floor\r\nwhere there is but little of other kinds of sediment they form the main\r\npart of the deposits, and in the course of ages build up very extensive\r\nformations which we call diatomaceous earth or tripolite, if the\r\norganisms are siliceous, or limestone if they are calcareous. A very\r\nsatisfactory account of the formation of limestone on a stupendous scale\r\nby the polyps in coral reefs and islands is contained in No. IV. of this\r\nseries of guides.\r\n\r\nThe rocks here considered may be, and, as we have already seen,\r\nsometimes are, deposited in a purely chemical way, without the aid of\r\nlife; and it is important to observe that in no case do the organisms\r\nmake the silica and carbonate of calcium of their skeletons, but they\r\nsimply appropriate and reduce to the solid state what exists ready made\r\nin solution in the sea-water. These minerals, and others, as we know,\r\nare produced by the decomposition of the rocks of the land, and are\r\nbeing constantly carried into the sea by rivers; and, if there were no\r\nanimals in the sea, these processes would still go on until the\r\nsea-water became saturated with these substances, when their\r\nprecipitation as limestone, etc., would necessarily follow. Hence it is\r\nclear that all the animals do is to effect the precipitation of certain\r\nminerals somewhat sooner than it would otherwise occur; so that from a\r\ngeological standpoint the differences between chemical and organic\r\ndeposition are not great.\r\n\r\nThis section of our subject may be summarized as follows: Animals and\r\nplants contribute to the formation of rocks in three distinct ways:—\r\n\r\n1. During their growth they deoxidize carbon dioxide and water,\r\nand reduce to the solid state in their tissues carbon and the\r\npermanent gases oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen; and after death,\r\nthrough the accumulation of the half-decayed tissues in favorable\r\nlocalities,—marshes, etc.,—these elements are added to the solid\r\ncrust of the earth in the form of coal and bitumen.\r\n\r\n2. During the decomposition, _i.e._, oxidation, of the organic tissues,\r\nthe iron existing everywhere in the soil is partially deoxidized, and,\r\nbeing thus rendered soluble, is removed by rain-water and concentrated\r\nin low places, forming beds of iron-ore.\r\n\r\n3. Through the agency of marine organisms, certain mineral substances\r\nare being constantly removed from the sea-water and deposited upon the\r\nocean floor, forming various calcareous and siliceous rocks.\r\n\r\nI now bring our study of the aqueous or superficial agencies to a\r\nconclusion by noting once more that the great geological results\r\naccomplished by _air_, _water_, and _organic matter_ or _life_ are: (1)\r\n_Erosion_, or the wearing away of the surface of the land; and (2)\r\n_Deposition_, or the formation from the débris of the eroded land of two\r\ngreat classes of stratified rocks,—the mechanically formed or fragmental\r\nrocks, and the chemically and organically formed rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         II. IGNEOUS AGENCIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pass next to a very brief consideration of operations that originate\r\nbelow the earth’s surface. The records of deep mines and artesian wells\r\nshow that the temperature of the ground always increases downwards from\r\nthe surface; and the much higher temperatures of hot springs and\r\nvolcanoes show that the heat continues to increase to a great depth, and\r\nis not a merely superficial phenomenon. The observed rate of increase is\r\nnot uniform, but it seldom varies far from the average, which is about\r\n1° Fahr. per 53 feet of vertical descent, or, in round numbers, 100° per\r\nmile. This rate, if continued, would give a very high temperature at\r\npoints only a few miles below the surface; and until within a few years\r\nthe idea was generally accepted by geologists that the increase of\r\ntemperature is sensibly uniform for an indefinite distance downward;\r\nthat in the central regions of the earth the temperature is far higher\r\nthan anything we can conceive, and that everywhere below a depth of 20\r\nto 40 miles the temperature is above the fusing-point of all rocks; and\r\nhence that the earth is an incandescent liquid globe covered by a thin\r\nshell or crust of cold, solid rock.\r\n\r\nOur limited space will not permit us to enter into a discussion of the\r\ncondition of the earth’s interior, and I will merely point out in a few\r\nsentences the position occupied by geologists at the present time. The\r\nreasoning of Thompson has shown that the temperature cannot increase\r\ndownward at a uniform rate, but at a constantly and rapidly diminishing\r\nrate; and that everywhere below a depth of 300 miles the temperature is\r\nprobably sensibly the same, and nowhere, probably, above 8000° to\r\n10,000° Fahr.\r\n\r\nUnlike water, all rocks contract on solidifying and expand on melting,\r\nand consequently the high pressures to which they are subjected in the\r\nearth’s interior—10,000,000 to 20,000,000 pounds per square inch—must\r\nraise their fusing-points enormously, and the probabilities are that\r\nthey are solid, in spite of the high temperature. But Thompson and\r\nDarwin have shown us farther that the phenomena of the oceanic tides\r\ncould not be what they are known to be if the earth were any less rigid\r\nthan a globe of solid steel; while Hopkins has proved that the\r\nastronomical phenomena of precession and nutation could not be what they\r\nare if the earth’s crust were less than 800 or 1000 miles thick. Putting\r\nthese considerations together, geologists are almost universally agreed\r\nthat, while the earth has an incandescent interior, it is still\r\ncontinuously solid from centre to circumference, with the exception of a\r\nthin plastic stratum at a depth not exceeding 40 or 50 miles, which\r\nforms the seat of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nThe earth is not only a very hot body, but it is rotating through almost\r\nabsolutely cold space, and therefore must be a cooling body. But, except\r\nat the very beginning of the cooling, the loss of heat has gone on\r\nalmost entirely from the interior; and since cooling means contraction,\r\nthe heated interior must be constantly tending to shrink away from the\r\ncold external crust.\r\n\r\nOf course no actual separation between the crust and interior or nucleus\r\ncan take place, but there is no doubt that the crust is left unsupported\r\nto a certain extent, and it must then behave like an arch with a radius\r\nof 4000 miles, and the result is an enormous horizontal or tangential\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThis lateral pressure in the earth’s crust is one of the most important\r\nand most generally accepted facts in geology, and lies at the bottom of\r\nmany geological theories. According to what seems to me to be the most\r\nprobable theory of the origin of continents and ocean-basins, they are\r\nbroad upward and downward bendings or arches into which the crust is\r\nthrown by the tangential pressure. Finally, the strain becomes great\r\nenough to crush the crust along those lines where it is weakest. When\r\nthe crust is thus mashed up by horizontal pressure, a mountain range is\r\nformed, the crust becomes enormously thicker, and a weak place becomes a\r\nstrong one.\r\n\r\nDuring the formation of mountains the stratified rocks, which were\r\noriginally horizontal, are thrown into folds or arches, and tipped up at\r\nall possible angles; they are fractured and faults produced; and by the\r\nimmense pressure the structure known as slaty cleavage is developed. In\r\nfact, a vast amount and variety of structures are produced during the\r\ngrowth of a mountain range.\r\n\r\nThese great earth-movements are not always perfectly smooth and steady,\r\nbut they are accompanied by slipping or crushing now and then; and, as a\r\nresult of the shock thus produced, a swift vibratory movement or jar,\r\nwhich we know as an _earthquake_, runs through the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nExtensive fissures are also formed, opening down to the regions where\r\nthe rocks are liquid or plastic, and through these the melted rocks flow\r\nup to or toward the surface. That portion which flows out on the surface\r\nbuilds up a volcanic cone, while that which cools and solidifies below\r\nthe surface, in the fissures, forms dikes. Thus among the igneous or\r\neruptive rocks we have two great classes,—the _dike_ rocks and the\r\n_volcanic_ rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe that all these subterranean operations—the\r\nformation of continents, of mountain-ranges with all their attendant\r\nphenomena of folds, faults and cleavage, and every form and phase of\r\nearthquake and volcanic activity—depend upon or originate in the\r\ninterior heat of the earth. And over against the _superficial_ or\r\n_aqueous_ agencies, originating in the _solar_ heat and producing the\r\n_stratified_ or _sedimentary_ rocks, we set the _subterranean_ or\r\n_igneous_ agencies originating in the _central_ heat, and producing the\r\n_unstratified_ or _eruptive_ rocks.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn geology, just as in biology, there are two ways of studying\r\nstructure,—the small way and the large way. In the case of an organism,\r\nwe may select a single part or organ, and, disregarding its external\r\nform and relations to other parts, observe its composition and minute\r\nstructure, the various forms and arrangements of the cells, etc. This is\r\nhistology, and it is the complement of that larger method of studying\r\nstructure which is ordinarily understood by anatomy.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of structural geology corresponding to histology and\r\nanatomy are _lithology_ and _petrology_. Lithology is an in-door\r\nscience; we use the microscope largely, and work with hand specimens or\r\nthin sections of the rocks, observing the composition and those small\r\nstructural features which go under the general name of texture.\r\n\r\nIn petrology, on the other hand, we consider the larger kinds of\r\nrock-structure, such as stratification, jointing, folds, faults,\r\ncleavage, etc.; and it is essentially an out-door science, since to\r\nstudy it to the best advantage we must have, not hand specimens, but\r\nledges, cliffs, railway-cuttings, gorges, and mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LITHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA _rock_ is any mineral, or mixture of minerals, occurring in masses of\r\nconsiderable size. This distinction of size is the only one that can be\r\nmade between rocks and minerals, and that is very indefinite. A rock,\r\nwhether composed of one mineral or several, is always an aggregate; and\r\ntherefore no single crystal or mineral-grain can properly be called a\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to study particularly the various kinds of rocks, a\r\nlittle more preliminary work should be done. As already intimated, the\r\nmore important characteristics of rocks may be grouped under two general\r\nheads,—_composition_ and _texture_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Composition of Rocks._\r\n\r\nRocks are properly defined as large masses or aggregates of mineral\r\nmatter, consisting in some cases of one and in other cases of several\r\nmineral species. Hence it is clear that the composition of rocks is of\r\ntwo kinds: chemical and mineralogical; for the various chemical elements\r\nare first combined to form minerals, and then the minerals are combined\r\nto form rocks.\r\n\r\nOf course those minerals and elements which can be described as\r\nprincipal or important rock-constituents must be the common minerals and\r\nelements. Now it is a very important and convenient fact that although\r\nchemists recognize about sixty-five elementary substances, and these are\r\ncombined to form nearly one thousand mineral species, yet both the\r\n_common_ elements and the _common_ minerals are few in number.\r\n\r\nSo that, although it is very desirable and even necessary for the\r\nstudent of lithology to know something of chemistry and mineralogy, it\r\nby no means follows that he or she must be master of those sciences. A\r\nknowledge of the chemical and physical characteristics of a few common\r\nminerals is all that is absolutely essential, though it may be added\r\nthat an excess of wisdom in these directions is no disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Chemical Composition of Rocks.\r\n\r\nThe elementary substances of which rocks are chiefly composed, which\r\nmake up the main mass of the earth so far as we are acquainted with it,\r\nnumber only fourteen:—\r\n\r\n_Non-Metallic or Acidic Elements._—Oxygen, silicon, carbon, sulphur,\r\nchlorine, phosphorus, and fluorine.\r\n\r\n_Metallic or Basic Elements._—Aluminum, magnesium, calcium, iron,\r\nsodium, potassium, and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe elements are named in each group in about the order of their\r\nrelative abundance; and to give some idea of the enormous differences in\r\nthis respect it may be stated that two of the elements—oxygen and\r\nsilicon—form more than half of the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nSilicon, calcium, and fluorine, although exceedingly abundant, are also\r\nvery difficult to obtain in the free or uncombined state, and specimens\r\nlarge enough to exhibit to a class would be very expensive. With these\r\nexceptions, however, examples of these common rock-forming elements are\r\neasily obtained.\r\n\r\nMy purpose in calling attention to this point is simply to suggest that\r\nthe proper way to begin the study of minerals and rocks with children is\r\nto first familiarize them with the elements of which they are composed.\r\nThe most important thing to be known about any mineral is its chemical\r\ncomposition; and when a child is told that a mineral—corundum, for\r\nexample—is composed of oxygen and aluminum, he should have a distinct\r\nconception of the properties of each of those elements, for otherwise\r\ncorundum is for him a mere compound of names.\r\n\r\nIt is very important, too, if the pupil has not already studied\r\nchemistry, that he should be led to some comprehension of the nature of\r\nchemical union and of the difference between a chemical compound and a\r\nmechanical mixture. For this purpose a few simple experiments (the\r\ndetails of which would be out of place here) with the more common and\r\nfamiliar elements will be sufficient. Mrs. Richard’s “First Lessons in\r\nMinerals” should be introduced here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Mineralogical Composition of Rocks.\r\n\r\nThe fourteen elements named above are combined to form about fifty\r\nminerals with which the student of geology should be acquainted; but not\r\nmore than one-half of these are of the first importance. It is desired\r\nto lay especial emphasis upon the importance of a perfect familiarity\r\nwith these few common minerals. There is nothing else in the whole range\r\nof geology so easily acquired which is at the same time so valuable; for\r\nit is entirely impossible to comprehend the definitions of rocks, or to\r\nrecognize rocks certainly and scientifically, unless we are acquainted\r\nwith their constituent minerals.\r\n\r\nWith one or two exceptions, these common rock-forming minerals may be\r\neasily distinguished by their physical characters alone, so that their\r\ncertain recognition is a matter of the simplest observation, and\r\nentirely within the capacity of young children. Furthermore, being\r\ncommon, specimens of these minerals are very easily obtained, so that\r\nthere is no reason why teachers should not here adopt the best method\r\nand place a specimen of each mineral in the hands of each pupil. Typical\r\nexamples, large enough to show the characteristics well, ought not to\r\ncost, on the average, over two cents apiece.\r\n\r\nA MINERAL is an inorganic body having theoretically a definite chemical\r\ncomposition, and usually a regular geometric form.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MINERALS.—These may be grouped under\r\nthe following general heads:—\r\n\r\n(1) _Composition_, (2) _Crystalline form_, (3) _Hardness_, (4) _Specific\r\ngravity_, (5) _Lustre_, (6) _Color and Streak_.\r\n\r\n1. _Composition._—This, according to the definition of a mineral, ought\r\nto be _definite_, and expressible by a chemical formula. When it is not\r\nso, we usually consider that the mineral is partially decomposed, or\r\nthat we are dealing with a mixture of minerals. It is well to impress\r\nupon the mind of the pupil the important fact that the more fundamental\r\nproperties of the elements, such as specific gravity and lustre, are not\r\nlost when they combine, but may be traced in the compounds. In other\r\nwords, the properties of minerals are, in a very large degree, the\r\naverage of the properties of the elements of which they are composed;\r\nminerals in which heavy metallic elements predominate being heavy and\r\nmetallic, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nTo fully appreciate this point it is only necessary to compare a mineral\r\nlike galenite—a common ore of lead, and containing nearly 87 per cent.\r\nof that heavy metal; or hematite (specimen 13), containing 70 per cent.\r\nof another heavy metal, iron—with quartz (specimen 15), which is\r\ncomposed in nearly equal parts of oxygen and silicon, two typical\r\nnon-metallic elements. Many minerals contain water, _i.e._, are\r\nhydrated. Now water, whether we consider the liquid or solid state, is\r\none of the lightest and softest of mineral constituents; and it is a\r\nvery important fact that hydrated minerals are invariably lighter and\r\nusually softer than anhydrous species of otherwise similar composition.\r\nOther striking illustrations of this principle will be pointed out in\r\nthe descriptions of the minerals which follow.\r\n\r\n2. _Crystalline form._—A crystal is bounded by plane surfaces\r\nsymmetrically arranged with reference to certain imaginary lines passing\r\nthrough its centre and called axes. Crystals of the same species are\r\nalways constant in the angles between like planes, while similar angles\r\nusually vary in different species; so that each species has its own\r\npeculiar form.\r\n\r\n“Besides external symmetry of form, crystallization produces also\r\nregularity of internal structure, and often of fracture. This regularity\r\nof fracture, or tendency to break or cleave along certain planes, is\r\ncalled cleavage. The surface afforded by cleavage is often smooth and\r\nbrilliant (see specimens 17, 18, and 21), and is always parallel with\r\nsome external plane of the crystal. It should be understood that the\r\ncleavage lamellæ are not in any sense present before they are made to\r\nappear by fracture.”—(Dana.)\r\n\r\nCrystals are arranged in six systems, based upon the number and\r\nrelations of the axes, as follows:—\r\n\r\nIsometric System.—Three equal axes crossing at right angles. Example,\r\ncube.\r\n\r\nTetragonal System.—Two axes equal, third unequal, all crossing at right\r\nangles. Example, square prism.\r\n\r\nOrthorhombic System.—Three unequal axes, but intersections all at right\r\nangles. Example, rhombic prism.\r\n\r\nMonoclinic System.—Three unequal axes, one intersection oblique.\r\nExample, oblique rhombic prism.\r\n\r\nTriclinic System.—Three unequal axes, all crossing obliquely. Example,\r\noblique rhomboidal prism.\r\n\r\nHexagonal System.—Three equal axes lying in one plane and intersecting\r\nat angles of 60°, and a fourth axis crossing each of these at right\r\nangles and longer or shorter. Example, hexagonal prism.\r\n\r\nBy the truncation and bevelment of the angles and edges of these\r\nfundamental forms a vast variety of secondary forms are produced. The\r\nlimits of the guide will not permit us to follow this topic farther; but\r\nit may be added that for the proper elucidation of even the simpler\r\ncrystalline forms the teacher should be provided with a set of wooden\r\ncrystal models and Dana’s “Text-Book of Mineralogy.”\r\n\r\nThe crystallization of a mineral may be manifested in two ways: first,\r\nby the regularity of its internal structure or molecular arrangement, as\r\nshown by cleavage and the polarization of transmitted light; and,\r\nsecond, by the regularity of external form which follows, _under\r\nfavorable conditions_, as a necessary consequence of symmetry in the\r\narrangement of the molecules.\r\n\r\nWhen a mineral is entirely devoid of crystalline structure, both\r\nexternally and internally, it is said to be _amorphous_.\r\n\r\nPerfect and distinct crystals are the rare exception, most mineral\r\nspecimens being simply aggregates of imperfect crystals. In such cases,\r\nand when the mineral is amorphous, the _structure_ of the _mass_ may\r\nbe:—\r\n\r\nColumnar or fibrous.\r\n\r\nLamellar, foliaceous, or micaceous.\r\n\r\nGranular.—When the grains or crystalline particles are invisible to the\r\nnaked eye the mineral is called _impalpable_, _compact_, or _massive_.\r\n\r\nAnd the _external form_ of the mass may be:—\r\n\r\nBotryoidal, having grape-like surfaces.\r\n\r\nStalactitic, forming stalactites or pendant columns.\r\n\r\nAmygdaloidal or Concretionary, forming separate globular masses in the\r\nenclosing rock.\r\n\r\nDendritic, branching or arborescent.\r\n\r\n3. _Hardness._—By the hardness of a mineral we mean the resistance which\r\nit offers to abrasion. But hardness is a purely relative term, calcite,\r\nfor example, being hard compared with talc, but very soft compared with\r\nquartz. Hence mineralogists have found it necessary to select certain\r\nminerals to be used as a standard of comparison for all others, and\r\nknown as the _scale of hardness_. These are arranged at nearly equal\r\nintervals all the way from the softest mineral to the hardest, as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Scale of Hardness._\r\n\r\n                          (1) Talc.\r\n                          (2) Gypsum.\r\n                          (3) Calcite.\r\n                          (4) Fluorite.\r\n                          (5) Apatite.\r\n                          (6) Orthoclase.\r\n                          (7) Quartz.\r\n                          (8) Topaz or Beryl.\r\n                          (9) Corundum.\r\n                          (10) Diamond.\r\n\r\nIf a mineral scratches calcite and is scratched by fluorite, we say its\r\nhardness is between 3 and 4, perhaps 3.5; if it neither scratches nor is\r\nscratched by orthoclase, its hardness is 6; and so on. There are very\r\nfew minerals harder than quartz, and hence the first seven members of\r\nthe scale are sufficient for all ordinary purposes; and these are all\r\nincluded in the series of specimens accompanying this Guide.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is desirable to be acquainted with the scale of hardness,\r\nand to understand how to use it, still the student will learn, after a\r\nlittle practice, that almost as good results may be obtained much more\r\nconveniently by the use of his thumb-nail and a good knife-blade or\r\nfile. Talc and gypsum are easily scratched with the nail; calcite and\r\nfluorite yield easily to the knife or file, apatite with more\r\ndifficulty; while orthoclase is near the limit of the hardness of\r\nordinary steel, and quartz is entirely beyond it.\r\n\r\n4. _Specific Gravity._—The specific gravity of a mineral, by which we\r\nmean its weight as compared with the weight of an equal volume of water,\r\nis determined by weighing it first in air and then in water, and\r\ndividing the weight in air by the difference of the two weights.\r\nMinerals exhibit a wide range in specific gravity; from petroleum, which\r\nfloats on water, to gold, which is nearly twenty times heavier than\r\nwater. Although this is one of the most important properties of\r\nminerals, yet, being more difficult to measure than hardness, it is less\r\nvaluable as an aid in distinguishing species. One can with practice,\r\nhowever, estimate the density of a mineral pretty closely by lifting it\r\nin the hand.\r\n\r\n5. _Lustre._—Of all the properties of minerals depending on their\r\nrelations to light the most important is lustre, by which we mean the\r\nquality of the light reflected by a mineral as determined by the\r\ncharacter or minute structure of its surface. Two kinds of lustre, the\r\n_metallic_ and _vitreous_, are of especial importance; in fact all other\r\nkinds are merely varieties of these.\r\n\r\nThe metallic lustre is the lustre of all true metals, as copper and tin,\r\nand characterizes nearly all minerals in which metallic elements\r\npredominate. The vitreous lustre is best exemplified in glass, but\r\nbelongs to most minerals composed chiefly of non-metallic elements.\r\nMetallic minerals are always opaque, but vitreous minerals are often\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of lustre are the _adamantine_ (the lustre of diamond),\r\n_resinous_, _pearly_, and _silky_. When a mineral has no lustre, like\r\nchalk, it is said to be dull.\r\n\r\nIt should be made clear to children that lustre and color are entirely\r\ndistinct and independent. Thus, iron, copper, gold, silver, and lead are\r\nall metallic; while white or colorless quartz, black tourmaline, green\r\nberyl, red garnet, etc., are all vitreous. Generally speaking, any color\r\nmay occur with any lustre.\r\n\r\n6. _Color and Streak._—The colors of minerals are of two\r\nkinds,—_essential_ and _non-essential_. By the essential color in any\r\ncase we mean the color of the mineral itself in its purest state. The\r\nnon-essential colors, on the other hand, are chiefly the colors of the\r\nimpurities contained in the minerals.\r\n\r\nMetallic minerals, which are always opaque, usually have essential\r\ncolors; but vitreous minerals, which are always more or less\r\ntransparent, often have non-essential colors. The explanation is this:\r\nIn opaque minerals we can only see the impurities immediately on the\r\nsurface, and these are, as a rule, not enough to affect its color; but\r\nin diaphanous minerals we look _into_ the specimen and see impurities\r\nbelow the surface, and thus bring into view, in many cases, sufficient\r\nimpurity so that its color drowns that of the mineral.\r\n\r\nTo prove this we have only to take any mineral (serpentine is a good\r\nexample in our series) having a non-essential color, and make it opaque\r\nby pulverizing it or abrading its surface, when the non-essential color,\r\nthe color of the impurity, immediately disappears; just as water, yellow\r\nwith suspended clay, becomes white when whipped into foam, and thus made\r\nopaque.\r\n\r\nWhat we understand by the _streak_ of a mineral is its essential color,\r\nthe color of its powder; and it is so called because the powder is most\r\nreadily observed by scratching the surface of the mineral, and thereby\r\npulverizing a minute portion of it. The streak and hardness are thus\r\ndetermined at the same time. The streak of soft minerals is easily\r\ndetermined by rubbing them on any white surface of suitable hardness, as\r\npaper, porcelain, or Arkansas stone.\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL AND ACCESSORY MINERALS.—Lithologists, regarding minerals as\r\nconstituents of rocks, divide them into two great classes: the\r\n_essential_ and the _accessory_. The essential constituents of a rock\r\nare those minerals which are essential to the definition of the rock.\r\nFor example, we cannot properly define granite without naming quartz and\r\northoclase; hence these are essential constituents of granite; and if\r\neither of these minerals were removed from granite it would not be\r\ngranite any longer, but some other rock. But other minerals, like\r\ntourmaline and garnet, may be indifferently present or absent; it is\r\ngranite still; hence they are merely accidental or accessory\r\nconstituents. They determine the different _varieties_ of granite, while\r\nthe essential minerals make the _species_.\r\n\r\nThis classification, of course, is not absolute, for in many cases the\r\nsame mineral forms an essential constituent of one rock and an accessory\r\nconstituent of another. Thus, quartz is essential in granite, but\r\naccessory in diorite.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL MINERALS CONSTITUTING ROCKS.—Having studied in a general way\r\nthe more important characteristics of minerals, brief descriptions of\r\nthe chief rock-forming species are next in order. We will notice first\r\nand principally those minerals occurring chiefly as _essential_\r\nconstituents of rocks.\r\n\r\n1. Graphite.—Essentially pure carbon, though often mixed with a little\r\niron oxide. Crystallizes in hexagonal system, but usually foliated,\r\ngranular, or massive. Hardness, 1-2, being easily scratched with the\r\nnail. Sp. gr., 2.1-2.3. Lustre, metallic; an exception to the rule that\r\nacidic elements have non-metallic or vitreous lustres. Streak, black and\r\nshining (see pencil-mark on white paper). Color, iron-black. Slippery or\r\ngreasy feel. Every _black-lead_ pencil is a specimen of graphite.\r\nSpecimen 9.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of mineral coal are, geologically, as we have seen,\r\nclosely related to graphite, but they are such familiar substances that\r\nthey need not be described here.\r\n\r\n2. Halite (common salt).—Chloride of sodium: chlorine, 60.7; sodium,\r\n39.3; = 100. Isometric system, usually forming cubes. Hardness, 2.5, a\r\nlittle harder than the nail. Sp. gr., 2.1-2.6. Lustre, vitreous. Streak\r\nand color both white, and hence color is essential. Often transparent.\r\nSoluble; taste, purely saline. In specific gravity and lustre it is a\r\ngood example of a mineral in which an acidic element predominates.\r\nSpecimen 11.\r\n\r\n3. Limonite.—Hydrous sesquioxide of iron: oxygen, 25; iron, 60; water,\r\n15; = 100. Usually amorphous; occurring in stalactitic and botryoidal\r\nforms, having a fibrous structure; and also concretionary, massive, and\r\nearthy (yellow ochre). Hardness, 5-5.5. Sp. gr., 3.6-4. Lustre, vitreous\r\nor silky, inclining to metallic, and sometimes dull. Color, various\r\nshades of black, brown, and yellow. Streak, ochre-yellow; hence color\r\npartly non-essential. Specimen 12.\r\n\r\n4. Hematite.—Sesquioxide of iron: oxygen, 30; iron, 70; = 100. Hexagonal\r\nsystem, in distinct crystals, but usually lamellar, granular, or\r\ncompact,—columnar, botryoidal, and stalactitic forms being common.\r\nHardness, 5.5-6.5; good crystals are harder than steel. Sp. gr.,\r\n4.5-5.3. Lustre, metallic, sometimes dull. Color, iron-black, but red\r\nwhen earthy or pulverized (red ochre). Streak, red, and color,\r\ntherefore, mainly non-essential; sometimes attracted by the magnet.\r\nSpecimen 13.\r\n\r\nHematite has the same composition as limonite, minus the water; and by\r\ncomparing the hardness and specific gravity of these two minerals we see\r\nthat they are a good illustration of the principle that hydrous minerals\r\nare softer and lighter than anhydrous minerals of analogous composition.\r\nLimonite and hematite are two great natural coloring agents, and almost\r\nall yellow, brown, and red colors in rocks and soils are due to their\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n5. Magnetite.—Protoxide and sesquioxide of iron: oxygen, 27.6; iron,\r\n72.4; = 100. Isometric system, usually in octahedrons or dodecahedrons.\r\nMost abundant variety is coarsely to finely granular, sometimes\r\ndendritic. Hardness, 5.5-6.5, same as hematite. Sp. gr., 4.9-5.2.\r\nLustre, metallic. Color and streak, iron-black, and hence color\r\nessential. Strongly magnetic; some specimens have distinct polarity, and\r\nare called loadstones. Specimen 14.\r\n\r\nThe three iron-oxides just described—limonite, hematite, and\r\nmagnetite—are all important ores of iron, and form a well-marked natural\r\nseries. Thus limonite is never, hematite is usually, and magnetite is\r\nalways, crystalline. Again, limonite with 60 per cent. of iron is never\r\nmagnetic, hematite with 70 per cent. is sometimes magnetic, while\r\nmagnetite with 72.4 per cent. is always magnetic. As the iron increases\r\nso does the magnetism. We have here an excellent illustration of the\r\nprinciple that the properties of the elements can be traced in those\r\nminerals in which they predominate. Iron is the only strongly magnetic\r\nelement: magnetite contains more iron than any other mineral, and it is\r\nthe only strongly magnetic mineral.\r\n\r\nThese three iron-ores are easily distinguished from each other by the\r\ncolor of their powders or streak,—limonite yellow, hematite red, and\r\nmagnetite black,—and from all other common minerals by their high\r\nspecific gravity.\r\n\r\n6. Quartz.—Oxide of silicon or silica: oxygen, 53.33; silicon, 46.67; =\r\n100. Hexagonal system. The most common form is a hexagonal prism\r\nterminated by a hexagonal pyramid. Also coarsely and finely granular to\r\nperfectly compact, like flint; the compact or cryptocrystalline\r\nvarieties often assuming botryoidal, stalactitic, and concretionary\r\nforms. It has no cleavage, but usually breaks with an irregular,\r\nconchoidal fracture like glass. Hardness, 7, being No. 7 of the scale;\r\nscratches glass easily. Sp. gr., 2.5-2.8. Lustre, vitreous. Pure quartz\r\nis colorless or white, but by admixture of impurities it may be of\r\nalmost any color. Streak always white or light colored. Quartz is\r\nusually, as in specimen 15, transparent and glassy, but may be\r\ntranslucent or opaque. It is almost absolutely infusible and insoluble.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of quartz are very numerous, but they may be arranged in\r\ntwo great groups:—\r\n\r\n1. _Phenocrystalline_ or _vitreous_ varieties, including rock-crystal,\r\namethyst, rose quartz, yellow quartz, smoky quartz, milky quartz,\r\nferruginous quartz, etc.\r\n\r\n2. _Cryptocrystalline_ or _compact_ varieties, including chalcedony,\r\ncarnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, flint, chert, etc. Only three varieties,\r\nhowever, are of any great geological importance; these are: common\r\nglassy quartz (spec. 15), flint (spec. 16), and chert.\r\n\r\nQuartz is one of the most important constituents of the earth’s crust,\r\nand it is also the hardest and most durable of all common minerals. We\r\nhave already observed (p. 12) that it is entirely unaltered by exposure\r\nto the weather; _i.e._, it cannot be decomposed; and, being very hard,\r\nthe same mechanical wear which, assisted by more or less chemical\r\ndecomposition, reduces softer minerals to an impalpable powder or clay,\r\nmust leave the quartz chiefly in the form of sand and gravel. This\r\nagrees with our observation that sand (spec. 30), especially, is usually\r\nmerely pulverized quartz.\r\n\r\n_Opal_ is a mineral closely allied to quartz, and may be mentioned in\r\nthis connection. It is of similar composition, but contains from 5 to 20\r\nper cent. of water, and is decidedly softer and lighter. Hardness,\r\n5.5-6.5; sp. gr., 1.9-2.3.\r\n\r\n7. Gypsum.—Hydrous sulphate of calcium: sulphur trioxide (SO₃), 46.5;\r\nlime (CaO), 32.6; water (H₂O), 20.9; = 100. Monoclinic system. Often in\r\ndistinct rhombic crystals; also foliated, fibrous, and finely granular.\r\nHardness, 1.5-2; the hardest varieties being No. 2 of the scale of\r\nhardness. Sp. gr., 2.3. Lustre, pearly, vitreous, or dull. Color and\r\nstreak usually white or gray. The principal varieties of gypsum are\r\n(_a_) _selenite_, which includes all distinctly crystallized or\r\ntransparent gypsum; (_b_) _fibrous gypsum_ or _satin-spar_; (_c_)\r\n_alabaster_, fine-grained, light-colored, and translucent. Gypsum is\r\neasily distinguished from all common minerals resembling it by its\r\nsoftness and the fact that it is not affected by acids. Specimen 17.\r\n\r\n8. Calcite.—Carbonate of calcium: carbon dioxide (CO₂), 44; lime (CaO),\r\n56; = 100. Hexagonal system, usually in rhombohedrons, scalenohedrons,\r\nor hexagonal prisms. Cleavage rhombohedral and highly perfect (specimen\r\n18). Also fibrous and compact to coarsely granular, in stalactitic,\r\nconcretionary, and other forms. Hardness, 2.5-3.5, usually 3 (see scale\r\nof hardness). Sp. gr., 2.5-2.75. Lustre, vitreous. Color and streak\r\nusually white. Transparent crystallized calcite is known as\r\n_Iceland-spar_, and is remarkable for its strong double refraction. When\r\nfinely fibrous it makes a _satin-spar_ similar to gypsum. Geologically\r\nspeaking, calcite is a mineral of the first importance, being the sole\r\nessential constituent of all limestones. It is readily distinguished\r\nfrom allied species by its perfect rhombohedral cleavage; by its\r\nsoftness, being easily scratched with a knife; and above all by its\r\nlively effervescence with acids, for it is the _only common_ mineral\r\neffervescing _freely_ with _cold dilute_ acid. To apply this test it is\r\nonly necessary to touch the specimen with a drop of dilute chlorohydric\r\nacid. The effervescence, of course, is due to the escape of the carbon\r\ndioxide in a gaseous form. Specimen 18.\r\n\r\n9. Dolomite.—Carbonate of calcium and magnesium: carbonate of calcium\r\n(CaCO₃), 54.35; carbonate of magnesium (MgCO₃), 45.65; = 100. Hexagonal\r\nsystem, being nearly isomorphous with calcite. Rhombohedral cleavage\r\nperfect. Hardness, 3.5-4; sp. gr., 2.8-2.9, being harder and heavier\r\nthan calcite. Lustre, color, and streak same as for calcite, from which\r\nit is most easily distinguished by its non-effervescence or only feeble\r\neffervescence with cold dilute acid, though effervescing freely with\r\nstrong or hot acid. Spec. 19.\r\n\r\n10. Siderite.—Carbonate of iron: carbon dioxide (CO₂), 37.9; protoxide\r\nof iron (FeO), 62.1; = 100. Crystallization and cleavage essentially the\r\nsame as for calcite and dolomite. Hardness, 3.5-4.5, and sp. gr.,\r\n3.7-3.9. Lustre, vitreous. Color, white, gray, and brown. Streak, white.\r\nWith acid, siderite behaves like dolomite. It is distinguished from both\r\ncalcite and dolomite by its high specific gravity, which is easily\r\nexplained by the fact that it is largely composed of the heavy element,\r\niron.\r\n\r\nWith one exception, the fifteen minerals which we have yet to study\r\nbelong to the class of silicates, which includes more than one-fourth of\r\nthe known species of minerals, and, omitting quartz and calcite, all of\r\nthe really important rock-constituents. The silicate minerals may be\r\nvery conveniently divided into two great groups, the _basic_ and\r\n_acidic_. This is not a sharp division; on the contrary, there is a\r\nperfectly gradual passage from one group to the other; and yet this is,\r\nfor geological purposes at least, a very natural classification. The\r\ndividing line falls in the neighborhood of 60 per cent. of silica;\r\n_i.e._, all species containing this proportion of silica or _less_ are\r\nclassed as basic, since in them the basic elements predominate; while\r\nthose containing _more_ than 60 per cent. of silica are classed as\r\nacidic, because their characteristics are determined chiefly by the acid\r\nelement or silica. The principal bases occurring in the silicates, named\r\nin the order of their relative importance, are aluminum, magnesium,\r\ncalcium, iron, sodium, and potassium; and of these, magnesium, calcium,\r\niron, and usually sodium, are especially characteristic of basic\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIron is the heaviest base; but all the bases, except sodium and\r\npotassium, are heavier than the acid—silica; consequently basic minerals\r\nmust be, as a rule, heavier than acidic minerals. And since basic\r\nminerals contain more iron than acidic, they must be darker colored. In\r\ngeneral, we say, _dark, heavy_ silicates are _basic_, and _vice versa_.\r\nAll this is of especial importance because in the rocks nature keeps\r\nthese two classes separate in a great degree.\r\n\r\n11. Amphibole.—Silicate of aluminum, magnesium, calcium, iron, and\r\nsodium. The bases occur in very various proportions, forming many\r\nvarieties; but the only variety of especial geological interest is\r\n_hornblende_, the average percentage composition of which is as follows:\r\nsilica (SiO₂), 50; alumina (Al₂O₃), 10; magnesia (MgO), 18; lime (CaO),\r\n12; iron oxide (FeO and Fe₂O₃), 8; and soda (Na₂O), 2; = 100. Monoclinic\r\nsystem: usually in rhombic or six-sided prisms which may be short and\r\nthick, but are more often acicular or bladed. Hardness, 5-6; sp. gr.,\r\n2.9-3.4. Lustre, vitreous; color, black and greenish black; and streak\r\nsimilar to color, but much paler. Compare with quartz, and observe the\r\nstrong contrast in color possible with minerals having the same lustre.\r\nSpecimen 20.\r\n\r\n12. Pyroxene.—Like amphibole, this species embraces many varieties, and\r\nthese exhibit a wide range in composition; but of these _augite_ alone\r\nis an important rock-constituent. Hence in lithology we practically\r\nsubstitute for amphibole and pyroxene, hornblende, and augite\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nAugite is very similar in composition to hornblende, but contains\r\nusually more lime and less alumina and alkali. Physically, too, these\r\nminerals are almost identical, crystallizing in the same system and in\r\nvery similar forms, and agreeing in hardness, color, lustre, and streak.\r\nAugite is heavier than hornblende, sp. gr., 3.2-3.5. A certain prismatic\r\nangle, which in augite is 87°5´, is 124°30´ in hornblende. Slender,\r\nbladed crystals are more common with hornblende than augite. When\r\nexamined in thin sections with the polarizer, augite does not afford the\r\nphenomenon of dichroism, which is strongly marked in hornblende.\r\nHowever, as these minerals commonly occur in the rocks, in small and\r\nimperfect crystals, these distinctions can only be observed in thin\r\nsections under the microscope; so that, as regards the naked eye, they\r\nare practically indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nIt might appear at first that the distinction of minerals so nearly\r\nidentical is not an important matter; but nature has decreed otherwise.\r\nAugite and hornblende are typical examples of basic minerals; but augite\r\nis, both in its composition and associations, the more basic of the two.\r\nIn proof of this we need only to know that it very rarely occurs in the\r\nsame rock with quartz, while hornblende is found very commonly in that\r\nassociation. Quartz in a rock means an excess of acid or silica, and\r\nalmost necessarily implies the absence of highly basic minerals. In\r\nother words, hornblende is often, and augite very rarely, found in\r\nconnection with acidic minerals; and it is this difference of\r\nassociation chiefly that makes their distinction essential to the proper\r\nrecognition of rocks; while at the same time it affords an easy, though\r\nof course not absolutely certain, means of determining whether the black\r\nconstituent of any particular rock is hornblende or augite.\r\n\r\n_Mica Family._—Mica is not the name of a single mineral, but of a whole\r\nfamily of minerals, including some half-dozen species. Only two,\r\nhowever,—muscovite and biotite,—are sufficiently abundant to engage our\r\nattention. These are complex, basic silicates of aluminum, magnesium,\r\niron, potassium, and sodium. The crystallization of biotite is\r\nhexagonal, and of muscovite monoclinic; but both occur commonly in flat\r\nsix-sided forms. Undoubtedly the most important and striking\r\ncharacteristic of the whole mica family is the remarkably perfect\r\ncleavage parallel with the basal planes of the crystals, and the\r\nwonderful _thinness_, and above all the _elasticity_, of the cleavage\r\nlamellæ. The cleavage contrasts the micas with all other common\r\nminerals, and makes their certain identification one of the easiest\r\nthings in lithology. The micas are soft minerals, the hardness ranging\r\nfrom 2 to 3, and being usually easily scratched with the nail. Sp. gr.\r\nvaries from 2.7-3.1. Lustre, pearly; and streak, white or uncolored.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing features of muscovite and biotite are as follows:—\r\n\r\n13. Muscovite.—Contains 47 per cent. of silica, 3 per cent. of\r\nsesquioxide of iron, and 10 per cent. of alkalies, chiefly potash; and\r\nthe characteristic colors are white, gray, and, more rarely, brown and\r\nyellow. Non-dichroic. Usually found in association with acidic minerals.\r\nThe mica used in the arts is muscovite. Specimen 21.\r\n\r\n14. Biotite.—Contains only 36 per cent. of silica, 20 per cent. of oxide\r\nof iron, and 17 per cent. of magnesia; colors, deep black to green.\r\nStrongly dichroic. Commonly occurs with other basic minerals. Compare\r\ncolor with per cent. of iron.\r\n\r\nThese differences are tabulated below:—\r\n\r\n            _Muscovite_ =              _Biotite_ =\r\n                Acidic mica.               Basic mica.\r\n                Non-ferruginous mica.      Ferruginous mica.\r\n                Potash mica.               Magnesian mica.\r\n                White mica.                Black mica.\r\n                Non-dichroic mica.         Dichroic mica.\r\n\r\n_Feldspar Family._—Like mica, _feldspar_ is the name of a family of\r\nminerals; and these are, geologically, the most important of all\r\nminerals. They are, above all others, the minerals of which rocks are\r\nmade, and their abundance is well expressed in the name,—feldspar being\r\nsimply the German for field-spar, implying that it is the common spar or\r\nmineral of the fields.\r\n\r\nChemically, the feldspars are silicates of aluminum and potassium,\r\nsodium or calcium. They crystallize in the monoclinic and triclinic\r\nsystems; and all possess easy cleavage in two directions at right angles\r\nto each other, or nearly so. The general physical characters, including\r\nthe cleavage, are well exhibited in the common species, orthoclase\r\n(specimen 22).\r\n\r\nIn hardness the feldspars range from 5 to 7, being usually near 6, and\r\nalmost always distinctly softer than quartz. Sp. gr. varies from\r\n2.5-2.75; lustre, from vitreous to pearly; color, from white and gray to\r\nred, brown, green, etc., but usually light. Streak, always white; rarely\r\ntransparent. By exposure to the weather, feldspars gradually lose their\r\nalkalies and lime, become hydrated, and are changed to kaolin or common\r\nclay. A similar change takes place with the micas, augite, and\r\nhornblende; but these species, being usually rich in iron, make clays\r\nwhich are much darker colored than those derived from feldspars. The\r\nfact that the feldspars contain little or no iron undoubtedly explains\r\ntheir low specific gravity and light colors, as compared with the other\r\nminerals just named. The only common minerals for which the feldspars\r\nare liable to be mistaken are quartz and the carbonates. From the latter\r\nthey are easily distinguished by their superior hardness and\r\nnon-effervescence with acids; and from the former, by possessing\r\ndistinct cleavage, by being rarely transparent, by being somewhat\r\nsofter, and by changing to clay on exposure to the weather.\r\n\r\nThe feldspars of greatest geological interest are five in number, and\r\nmay be classified chemically as follows:—\r\n\r\n     Orthoclase,—silicate of aluminum and potassium, or\r\n                                                potash feldspar.\r\n\r\n     Albite,—silicate of aluminum and sodium, or\r\n                                                soda feldspar.\r\n\r\n     Anorthite,—silicate of aluminum and calcium, or\r\n                                                lime feldspar.\r\n\r\n     Oligoclase,—silicate of aluminum and sodium, and calcium, or\r\n                                                soda-lime feldspar.\r\n\r\n     Labradorite,—silicate of aluminum and calcium, and sodium, or\r\n                                                lime-soda feldspar.\r\n\r\nThis appears like a complex arrangement, but it can be simplified.\r\nOrthoclase crystallizes in the monoclinic system, and all the other\r\nfeldspars in the triclinic system. With the exception of albite, which\r\nis a comparatively rare species, the triclinic feldspars all contain\r\nless silica than orthoclase; _i.e._, are more basic. This is shown by\r\nthe subjoined table giving the average composition of each of the\r\nfeldspars:—\r\n\r\n                 SiO₂     Al₂O₃      K₂O      Na₂O      CaO   Total.\r\n   Orthoclase,    65        18        17       --        --  =  100\r\n   Albite,        68        20        --       12        --  =  100\r\n   Oligoclase,    62        24        --        9         5  =  100\r\n   Labradorite,   53        30        --        4        13  =  100\r\n   Anorthite,     43        37        --       --        20  =  100\r\n\r\nAs we should naturally expect, the triclinic feldspars occur usually\r\nwith other basic minerals, while the monoclinic species, orthoclase, is\r\nacidic in its associations; furthermore, the triclinic feldspars are\r\noften intimately associated with each other, but are rarely important\r\nconstituents of rocks containing much orthoclase. In other words, the\r\ndistinction of orthoclase from the basic or triclinic feldspars is\r\nimportant and comparatively easy, while the distinction of the different\r\nbasic feldspars from each other is both unimportant and difficult.\r\nHence, in lithology, we find it best to put all these basic feldspars\r\ntogether, as if they were one species, under the name _plagioclase_,\r\nwhich refers to the oblique cleavage of all these feldspars, and\r\ncontrasts with _orthoclase_, which refers to the right-angled cleavage\r\nof that species.\r\n\r\nThis statement of the relations of the feldspars is, of course, beyond\r\nthe comprehension of many children, and yet it should be understood by\r\nthe teacher who would lead the children to any but the most superficial\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n15. Orthoclase.—This is the common feldspar, and the most abundant of\r\nall minerals, being the principal constituent of granite, gneiss, and\r\nmany other important rocks. The most characteristic colors are white,\r\ngray, pinkish, and flesh-red. Specimen 22.\r\n\r\n16. Plagioclase.—Like orthoclase, these species may be of almost any\r\ncolor; yet these two great divisions of the feldspars are usually\r\ncontrasted in this respect. Thus, bluish and grayish colors are most\r\ncommon with plagioclase, and white or reddish colors with orthoclase.\r\nSpecimen 23 is labradorite, and, in every respect, a typical example of\r\nplagioclase. On certain faces and cleavage-surfaces of the plagioclase\r\ncrystals we may often observe a series of straight parallel lines or\r\nbands which are often very fine,—fifty to a hundred in a single crystal.\r\nThese striæ are due to the mode of twinning, and are of especial\r\nimportance, since, while they are very characteristic of plagioclase,\r\nthey never occur in orthoclase. As stated, these twinning striæ in\r\nplagioclase are often visible to the naked eye; and when they are not,\r\nthey may usually be revealed by examining a thin section under the\r\nmicroscope with polarized light. Plagioclase decays much more rapidly\r\nwhen exposed to the weather than orthoclase. This point becomes\r\nperfectly clear when we compare weathered ledges of diabase (or any\r\ntrap-rock, see specimen 2) and granite; for plagioclase is the principal\r\nconstituent of the former rock, and orthoclase of the latter.\r\n\r\n_Hydrous Silicates._—Many silicates contain water, and some of these are\r\nof great geological importance. What has been stated on a preceding page\r\nconcerning the softness and lightness of hydrated minerals is especially\r\napplicable here; for all the geologically important hydrous silicates\r\nare distinctly softer and lighter than anhydrous minerals of otherwise\r\nsimilar composition. Furthermore, they usually have an unctuous or\r\nslippery feel; and, with one exception (kaolin), are of a green or\r\ngreenish color.\r\n\r\n17. Kaolinite (Kaolin).—Hydrous silicate of aluminum: silica (SiO₂), 46;\r\nalumina (Al₂O₃), 40; and water (H₂O), 14; = 100. Orthorhombic system, in\r\nrhombic or hexagonal scales or plates, but usually earthy or clay-like.\r\nHardness, 1-2.5; sp. gr., 2.4-2.65. The pure mineral is white; but it is\r\nusually colored by impurities, the principal of which are iron oxides\r\nand carbonaceous matter. Kaolin is the most abundant of all the hydrous\r\nsilicates, and it is the basis and often the sole constituent of common\r\nclay,—a very common mineral, but rarely pure. We have already (p. 11)\r\nnoticed the mode of origin of kaolin or clay. It results from the\r\ndecomposition of various aluminous silicate minerals, especially the\r\nfeldspars. Under the combined influence of carbon dioxide and moisture,\r\nfeldspars give up their potassium, sodium, and calcium, and take on\r\nwater, and the result is kaolin. This mineral is believed to be always a\r\ndecomposition product. Perhaps the best, or at least the most\r\nconvenient, test for kaolin is the argillaceous odor, the odor of\r\nmoistened clay. Specimen 24.\r\n\r\n18. Talc.—Hydrous silicate of magnesium: silica (SiO₂), 63 (acidic);\r\nmagnesia (MgO), 32; water (H₂O), 5; = 100. Orthorhombic system, but\r\nrarely in distinct crystals. Cleavage in one direction very perfect; the\r\ncleavage lamellæ are flexible, but not elastic, as in mica. Hardness, 1;\r\nsee scale. Sp. gr., 2.55-2.8. Lustre, pearly. Color, apple-green to\r\nwhite; and streak, white. The feel is very smooth and greasy; and, in\r\nconnection with the color and foliation, affords the best means of\r\ndistinguishing talc from allied minerals. Talc sometimes results from\r\nthe alteration of augite, hornblende, and other minerals, but it is not\r\nalways nor usually an alteration product.\r\n\r\n19. Serpentine.—Hydrous silicate of magnesium: silica (SiO₂), 44\r\n(basic); magnesia (MgO), 44; water (H₂O), 12; = 100. Essentially\r\namorphous. Hardness, 2.5-4; sp. gr., 2.5-2.65. Lustre, greasy, waxy, or\r\nearthy. Color, various shades of green and usually darker than talc, but\r\nstreak always white. Feel, smooth, sometimes greasy. Distinguished from\r\ntalc by its hardness, compactness, and darker green. Sometimes results\r\nfrom the alteration of olivine and other magnesian minerals, but usually\r\nwe are to regard it as an original mineral. Specimen 25.\r\n\r\n20. Chlorite.—This is, properly, the name of a group of highly basic\r\nminerals of very variable composition, but they are all essentially\r\nhydrous silicates of aluminum, magnesium, and iron; and the average\r\ncomposition of the most abundant species, prochlorite, is as follows:\r\nsilica (SiO₂), 30; alumina (Al₂O₃), 18; magnesia (MgO), 15; protoxide of\r\niron (FeO), 26; and water (H₂O), 11; = 100. The chlorites crystallize in\r\nseveral different systems, but in all there is a highly perfect cleavage\r\nin one direction, giving, as in talc, a foliated structure with flexible\r\nbut inelastic laminæ. The cleavage scales, however, are sometimes\r\nminute, and the structure massive or granular. Hardness of prochlorite,\r\n1-2; between talc and serpentine. Sp. gr., 2.78-2.96. All the chlorites\r\nhave a pearly to vitreous lustre. Color usually some shade of green; in\r\nprochlorite a dark or blackish green, darker than serpentine, as that is\r\ndarker than talc. Streak, a lighter, whitish green. Less unctuous than\r\ntalc, but more so than serpentine. The chlorites are produced very\r\ncommonly, but not generally, by the alteration of basic anhydrous\r\nsilicates, like augite and hornblende. Specimen 26.\r\n\r\n21. Hydro-mica.—This, too, is properly the name of a group of minerals;\r\nbut for geological purposes they may be regarded as one species. Taking\r\na general view of the composition, these are simply the anhydrous or\r\nordinary micas, which we have already studied, with from 5 to 10 per\r\ncent. of water added. In crystallization and structure they are\r\nessentially mica-like. Although not distinctly softer than the common\r\nmicas, they are lighter, always more unctuous and slippery, and usually\r\nof a greenish color. The micaceous structure with _elastic_ laminæ\r\nserves to distinguish the hydro-micas from other hydrous silicates.\r\n\r\n22. Glauconite.—Hydrous silicate of aluminum, iron, and potassium:\r\nsilica (SiO₂), 50; alumina (Al₂O₃), protoxide of iron (FeO), and potash\r\n(K₂O), together, 41; and water (H₂O), 9; = 100. Amorphous, forming\r\nrounded and generally loose grains, which often have a microscopic\r\norganic nucleus. It is dull and earthy, like chalk, and always soft,\r\ngreen, and light, but not particularly unctuous. Glauconite is the\r\nprincipal, often the sole, constituent of the rock greensand, which\r\noccurs abundantly in the newer geological formations, and is now forming\r\nin the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico and along our Atlantic\r\nsea-board. Specimen 27.\r\n\r\nThis completes our list of minerals occurring chiefly as _essential_\r\nconstituents of rocks; and following are three of the more common and\r\nimportant minerals occurring chiefly as _accessory_, rarely as\r\nessential, rock-constituents.\r\n\r\n23. Chrysolite (Olivine).—Silicate of magnesium and iron: silica (SiO₂),\r\n41; magnesia (MgO), 51; protoxide of iron (Fe₂O₃), 8; = 100.\r\nOrthorhombic system; but usually in irregular glassy grains. Hardness,\r\n6-7. Sp. gr., 3.3-3.5. Lustre, vitreous; color, usually some shade of\r\ngreen; and streak, white. Chrysolite sometimes closely resembles quartz,\r\nbut its green color usually suffices to distinguish it. It is a common\r\nconstituent of basalt and allied rocks. By absorption of water it is\r\nchanged into serpentine and talc. See examples in specimen.\r\n\r\n24. Garnet.—The composition of this mineral is extremely variable; but\r\nthe most important variety is a basic silicate of aluminum and iron:\r\nsilica (SiO₂), 37; alumina (Al₂O₃), 20; and protoxide of iron (FeO), 43;\r\n= 100. Isometric system, usually in distinct crystals, twelve-sided\r\n(dodecahedrons) and twenty-four-sided (trapezohedrons) forms being most\r\ncommon. Hardness, 6.5-7.5; average as hard as quartz. Sp. gr., 3.15-4.3;\r\ncompare with the high percentage of iron. Lustre, vitreous; colors,\r\nvarious, usually some shade of red or brown; and streak, white. Some\r\nvarieties contain iron enough to make them magnetic. Garnet is easily\r\ndistinguished by its form, color, and hardness from all other minerals.\r\nIt is a common but not an abundant mineral, occurring most frequently in\r\ngneiss, mica schist, and other stratified crystalline rocks. See\r\nexamples in specimen.\r\n\r\n25. Pyrite.—Sulphide of iron: sulphur, 53.3; iron, 46.7; = 100.\r\nIsometric system, occurring usually in distinct crystals, the cube and\r\nthe twelve-sided form known as the pyritohedron being the most common.\r\nHardness, 6-6.5, striking fire with steel. Sp. gr., 4.8-5.2; heavy\r\nbecause rich in iron. Lustre, metallic and splendent. Color, pale,\r\nbrass-yellow, and streak, greenish or brownish. Pyrite is sometimes\r\nmistaken for gold, but it is not malleable; while its color, hardness,\r\nand specific gravity, combined, easily distinguish it from all common\r\nminerals. As an accessory rock-constituent, pyrite occurs usually in\r\nisolated cubes or pyritohedrons. Specimen 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Textures of Rocks._\r\n\r\n_Texture_ is a general name for those smaller structural features of\r\nrocks which can be studied in _hand specimens_, and which depend upon\r\nthe _forms_ and _sizes_ of the _constituent particles_ of the rocks, and\r\nthe _ways_ in which these are _united_.\r\n\r\nBy “constituent particles” we mean, not the atoms or molecules of matter\r\ncomposing the rocks, but the _pebbles_ in conglomerate, _grains of sand_\r\nin sandstone, _crystals of quartz_, _feldspar_, and _mica_ in granite,\r\netc. The four most important textures are:—\r\n\r\n(1) _Fragmental texture._—The rock is composed of mere irregular,\r\nangular, or rounded, but visible, fragments. Examples: sand, sandstone,\r\ngravel, conglomerate, etc. Specimens 30, 31, 28, 29.\r\n\r\n(2) _Crystalline texture._—The constituent particles are chiefly, at\r\nleast, distinctly crystalline, as shown either by external form, or\r\ncleavage, or both. Examples: granite, diabase, gneiss, etc. Specimens\r\n45, 1, 41.\r\n\r\n(3) _Compact texture._—The constituent particles are indistinguishable\r\nby the naked eye, but become visible under the microscope, appearing as\r\nseparate crystalline grains or as irregular fragments. In other words,\r\nif, in the case of either the granular or crystalline textures, we\r\nconceive the particles to become microscopically small, then we have the\r\ncompact texture. Examples: clay, slate, many limestones, basalt, etc.\r\nSpecimens 34, 35, 39.\r\n\r\n(4) _Vitreous texture._—The texture of glass, in which the constituent\r\nparticles are absolutely invisible even with the highest powers of the\r\nmicroscope, and may be nothing more than the _molecules_ of the\r\nsubstance, which thus, so far as our powers of observation are\r\nconcerned, presents a perfectly continuous surface. Examples: obsidian,\r\nglassy quartz, and some kinds of coal. Specimens 47, 15.\r\n\r\nThese four textures, which, it will be observed, are determined by the\r\nforms and sizes of the constituent particles, may be called the\r\n_primary_ textures, because every rock _must_ possess one of them. We\r\ncannot conceive of a rock which is neither fragmental, crystalline,\r\ncompact, nor vitreous. But in addition to one of the primary textures, a\r\nrock may or may not have one or more of what may be called _secondary_\r\ntextures. These are determined by the way in which the particles are\r\nunited, the mode or pattern of the arrangement, etc. Following are\r\ndefinitions of the principal secondary textures:—\r\n\r\n(1) _Laminated texture._—This exists where the particles are arranged in\r\nthin, parallel layers, which may be marked simply by planes of division,\r\nor the alternate layers may be composed of particles differing in\r\ncomposition, form, size, or color, etc. Among the laminated textures we\r\nthus distinguish: (_a_) the _banded_ texture, where the layers are\r\ncontrasted in color, texture, or composition, but cohere, so that there\r\nis no cleavage or easy splitting parallel with the stratification; and\r\n(_b_) the _schistose_ or _shaly_ texture, where such fissility or\r\nstratification-cleavage exists. If a fragmental, compact, or vitreous\r\nrock is fissile, we use the term _shaly_; but a fissile, crystalline\r\nrock is described as _schistose_. The banded texture may occur with the\r\nfragmental,—banded sandstones, etc.; with the crystalline,—many\r\ngneisses, etc. (specimen 41); with the compact,—many slates, limestones,\r\nfelsites, etc. (specimens 34, 42); with the vitreous,—banded obsidian,\r\nfurnace slags, and some coal. The schistose texture may occur with the\r\ncrystalline,—mica schist, etc. (specimen 43); and the shaly texture with\r\nthe compact and fragmental, but rarely with the vitreous.\r\n\r\n(2) _Porphyritic texture._—We have this texture when _separate_ and\r\n_distinct crystals_ of _any_ mineral, but most commonly of feldspar, are\r\nenclosed in a _relatively_ fine-grained base or matrix, which may be\r\neither crystalline, compact, or vitreous, but rarely fragmental.\r\nSpecimens 5, 6, 7 are examples of the porphyritic compact texture.\r\n\r\n(3) _Concretionary texture._—When one or more constituents of a rock\r\nhave the form, in whole or in part, not of distinct angular crystals,\r\nbut of rounded concretions, the texture is described as concretionary,\r\nthe concretions taking the place in this texture of the isolated\r\ncrystals in the porphyritic texture. This texture occurs in connection\r\nwith all the primary textures, but the most familiar example is oölitic\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\n(4) _Vesicular texture._—A rock has this texture when it contains\r\nnumerous small cavities or vesicles. These are most commonly produced by\r\nthe expansion of steam and other vapors when the rock is in a plastic\r\nstate; and hence the vesicular texture is found chiefly in volcanic\r\nrocks. Except rarely, it is associated only with the compact\r\ntexture,—ordinary stony lavas (specimen 49); and with the vitreous\r\ntexture,—pumice (specimen 48).\r\n\r\n(5) _Amygdaloidal texture._—In the course of time the vesicles of common\r\nlava are often filled with various minerals deposited by infiltrating\r\nwaters, giving rise to the amygdaloidal texture, from the Latin\r\n_amygdalum_, an almond, in allusion to a common form of the vesicles, or\r\namygdules, as they are called, after being filled. The amygdaloidal\r\ntexture is thus necessarily preceded by the vesicular, and is limited to\r\nthe same classes of rocks. Specimen 50.\r\n\r\nBesides the foregoing, there are many minor secondary textures. The\r\nrocks known as tufas have what may be called the _tufaceous_ texture.\r\nThen we have kinds of texture depending on the _strength_ of the union\r\nof the particles, as _strong_, _weak_, _friable_, _earthy_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Classification of Rocks._\r\n\r\nHaving finished our preliminary observations on the characteristics of\r\nrocks, we are now about ready to begin a systematic study of the rocks\r\nthemselves; but it is needful first to say a few words about the\r\nclassification of rocks, since upon this depends not only the order in\r\nwhich we shall take the rocks up, but also the ideas that will be\r\nimparted concerning their relations and affinities. The classifications\r\nwhich have been proposed at different times are almost as numerous as\r\nthe rocks themselves. Some of these are confessedly, and even\r\ndesignedly, artificial, as when we classify stones according to their\r\nuses in the arts, etc. But we want something more scientific, a\r\n_natural_ classification; that is, one based upon the natural and\r\npermanent characteristics of rocks. Rocks have been classified according\r\nto chemical composition, mineralogical composition, texture, color,\r\ndensity, hardness, etc.; but these arrangements, taken singly or all\r\ncombined, are inadequate.\r\n\r\nA _natural_ classification may be defined as a concise and systematic\r\nstatement of the natural relations existing among the objects\r\nclassified. Now the most important relations existing among rocks are\r\nthose due to their different origins. We must not forget that lithology\r\nis a branch of geology, and that geology is first of all a _dynamical_\r\nscience. The most important question that can be asked about any rock\r\nis, not What is it made of? but _How_ was it made? What were the general\r\nforces or agencies concerned in its formation? Rocks are the material in\r\nwhich the earth’s history is written, and what we want to know first\r\nconcerning any rock is what it can tell us of the condition of that part\r\nof the earth at the time it was made and subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Classification of Rocks._\r\n\r\n +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                      Sedimentary or Stratified Rocks.                    |\r\n +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                         MECHANICALLY FORMED.                             |\r\n +-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+\r\n |                       |   _Unconsolidated._     |   _Consolidated._      |\r\n +-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+\r\n |     _Conglomerate     |        Gravel.          |    Conglomerate.       |\r\n |        group._        |                         |                        |\r\n +-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+\r\n |      _Arenaceous      |         Sand.           |      Sandstone.        |\r\n |        group._        |                         |                        |\r\n +-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+\r\n |     _Argillaceous     |         Clay.           |        Slate.          |\r\n |        group._        |                         |                        |\r\n +-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+\r\n |                  CHEMICALLY AND ORGANICALLY FORMED.                      |\r\n +-----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------+\r\n |   _Coal   | _Iron-ore |_Calcareous |  _Metamorphic group (Silicates)._   |\r\n |  group._  | group._   |  group._   |   Acidic.

Hence, we want to know first of any rock whether\r\nit is of aqueous or igneous origin. Then, if it is a sedimentary rock,\r\nwhether it has been formed by the action chiefly of mechanical forces,\r\nor of chemical and organic forces. And, if it is an eruptive rock,\r\nwhether it has cooled and solidified below the earth’s surface in a\r\nfissure, and is a dike or trappean rock, or has flowed out on the\r\nsurface and cooled in contact with the air, and thus become an ordinary\r\nlava or volcanic rock.\r\n\r\nHere we have the outlines of our classification, and it will be observed\r\nthat we have simply reached the conclusion, in a somewhat roundabout\r\nmanner, that there should always be a general correspondence between the\r\nclassification of rocks and the classification of the forces that\r\nproduce them. The general plan of the preceding scheme of the\r\nclassification must now be clear, and the details will be explained as\r\nwe go along.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Descriptions of Rocks._\r\n\r\n\r\n                  1.—Sedimentary or Stratified Rocks.\r\n\r\n1. MECHANICALLY FORMED OR FRAGMENTAL ROCKS.—These consist of materials\r\ndeposited from _suspension_ in water, and the process of their formation\r\nis throughout chiefly mechanical. The materials deposited are mere\r\nfragments of older rocks; and, if the fragments are large, we call the\r\nnewly deposited sediment gravel; if finer, sand; and, if impalpably\r\nfine, clay. These fragmental rocks cannot be classified chemically,\r\nsince the same handful of gravel, for instance, may contain pebbles of\r\nmany different kinds of rocks, and thus be of almost any and very\r\nvariable composition. Such chemical distinctions as can be established\r\nare only partial, and the classification, like the origin, must be\r\nmechanical. Accordingly, as just shown, we recognize three principal\r\ngroups based upon the size of the fragments; viz.:—\r\n\r\n                        (1) Conglomerate group.\r\n                        (2) Arenaceous group.\r\n                        (3) Argillaceous group.\r\n\r\nThis mode of division is possible and natural, simply because, as we\r\nobserved in an early experiment, materials arranged by the mechanical\r\naction of water are always assorted according to size. When first\r\ndeposited, the gravel, sand, and clay are, of course, perfectly loose\r\nand unconsolidated; but in the course of time they may, under the\r\ninfluence of pressure, heat, and chemical action, attain almost any\r\ndegree of consolidation, becoming _conglomerate_, _sandstone_, and\r\n_slate_, respectively. The pressure may be vertical where it is due to\r\nthe weight of newer deposits, or horizontal where it results from the\r\ncooling and shrinking of the earth’s interior. The heat may result from\r\nmechanical movements, or contact with eruptive rocks; or it may be due\r\nsimply to the burial of the sediments, which, it will be seen, must\r\nvirtually bring them nearer the great source of heat in the earth’s\r\ninterior, on the same principle that the temperature of a man’s coat, on\r\na cold day, is raised by putting on an overcoat. The effect of the heat,\r\nordinarily, is simply drying, coöperating with the pressure to expel the\r\nwater from the sediments; but, if the temperature is high, it may bake\r\nor vitrify them, just as in brick-making. Sediments are consolidated by\r\nchemical action when mineral substances, especially calcium carbonate,\r\nthe iron oxides, and silica are deposited between the particles by\r\ninfiltrating waters, cementing the particles together. This principle is\r\neasily demonstrated experimentally by taking some loose sand and wetting\r\nit repeatedly with a saturated solution of some soluble mineral, like\r\nsalt or alum, allowing the water to evaporate each time before making a\r\nfresh application. The interstices between the grains are gradually\r\nfilled up, and the sand soon becomes a firm rock. But the student should\r\nclearly understand that, in geology, gravel, sand, and clay are just as\r\ntruly _rocks_ before their consolidation as after. It is plain then that\r\nin each of the principal groups of fragmental rocks we must recognize an\r\nunconsolidated division and a consolidated division.\r\n\r\n(1) _Conglomerate group._—The rocks belonging in this group we know\r\nbefore consolidation as _gravel_, and after consolidation as\r\n_conglomerate_.\r\n\r\nGravel.—The pebbles, as we have already seen, are usually, though not\r\nalways, well rounded or water-worn; and they may be of any size from\r\ncoarse grains of sand to boulders. As a rule, however, the larger\r\npebbles, especially, are of approximately uniform size in the same bed\r\nor layer of gravel, with, of course, sufficient fine material to fill\r\nthe interstices. Although the same limited mass of gravel may show the\r\nwidest possible range in chemical and mineralogical composition, yet\r\nhard rocks are evidently more likely than soft rocks to form pebbles;\r\nand hence quartz and quartz-bearing rocks usually predominate in\r\ngravels. Specimen 28.\r\n\r\nConglomerate.—Consolidated gravel. Children should be led to an\r\nappreciation of this point by a careful comparison of the forms of the\r\npebbles in the gravel and conglomerate. The conglomerate seems to\r\ncontain a larger proportion of fine material than ordinary gravel. But\r\nthis is because the gravel is usually, as with our specimen, taken from\r\nthe _surface_ of the beach, where, of course, the pebbles are clean and\r\nseparate; but if it had remained there to be covered by a subsequently\r\ndeposited layer, enough fine stuff would have been sifted into the holes\r\nto fill them. And in the finished gravel, just as in the conglomerate,\r\nthe pebbles are usually closely packed, with just sufficient sand and\r\nclay, or _paste_, as the material in which the pebbles are imbedded is\r\ncalled, to fill the interstices. The paste is usually similar in\r\ncomposition to the pebbles, with this difference: hard materials\r\npredominate in the pebbles and soft in the paste.\r\n\r\nStratified rocks generally show the stratification in parallel lines or\r\nbands differing in color, composition, etc.; but nothing like this can\r\nbe detected in our specimens of conglomerate; and the question might be\r\nasked, How do we know that this is a stratified rock? In answer, it can\r\nbe said that our hand-specimens appear unstratified simply because the\r\nrock is so coarse; but when we look at large masses, and especially when\r\nwe see it in place in the quarry, that parallel arrangement of the\r\nmaterial which we call stratification is usually very evident; and we\r\noften see precisely the same thing in gravel banks. It is, however,\r\nwholly unnecessary that we should _see_ the stratification in order to\r\nknow certainly that this is a stratified or aqueous rock, because the\r\nforms of the pebbles show very plainly that they have been fashioned and\r\ndeposited by moving water; and we have in the smallest specimen proof\r\npositive that our conglomerate is a consolidated sea-beach.\r\n\r\nConglomerate shows the same variations in composition and texture as\r\ngravel; it may be composed of almost any kind of material in pebbles of\r\nalmost any size. We recognize two principal varieties of conglomerate\r\nbased on the forms of the pebbles; if, as is usual, these are well\r\nrounded and water-worn, the rock is true _pudding-stone_ (specimen 29);\r\nbut, if they are angular, or show but little wear, it is called\r\n_breccia_.\r\n\r\n(2) _Arenaceous Group._—The conglomerate group passes insensibly into\r\nthe arenaceous group; for, from the coarsest gravel to the finest sand,\r\nthe gradation is unbroken, and every sandstone is merely a conglomerate\r\non a small scale.\r\n\r\nSand.—Like gravel, sand may be of almost any composition, but as a rule\r\nit is quartzose; quartz, on account of its hardness and the absence of\r\ncleavage, being better adapted than any other common mineral to form\r\nsand. Where the composition of a sand is not specified, a quartzose sand\r\nis always understood. By examining a typical sand with a lens, and\r\nnoting the glassy appearance of the grains, and then testing their\r\nhardness on a piece of glass, which they will scratch as easily as\r\nquartz, the pupil is readily convinced that each grain is simply an\r\nangular fragment of quartz. Specimen 30.\r\n\r\nSandstone.—Consolidated sand. In proving this, children will notice\r\nfirst the granular or sandy appearance of the sandstone; and then, with\r\nthe lens, that the grains in the sandstone have the same forms as the\r\nsand-grains. The stratification cannot be seen very distinctly in our\r\nhand-specimens, but in larger masses it is usually very plain, as may be\r\nobserved in the blocks used for building, and still better in the\r\nquarries. However, even if the stratification were not visible to the\r\neye, we could have no doubt that sandstone is a mechanically formed\r\nstratified rock; because the form of the grains, just as in the\r\nconglomerate, tells us that. Many sandstones, too, contain the fossil\r\nremains of plants and animals, and these are always regarded as\r\naffording positive proof that the rocks containing them belong to the\r\naqueous or stratified series.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of sandstone depending upon differences in\r\ncomposition, texture, etc., but we have not space to notice them in\r\ndetail. In sandstone, just as in sand, quartz is the predominant\r\nconstituent, although we sometimes find varieties composed largely or\r\nentirely of feldspar, mica, calcite, or other minerals. Specimen 31 is\r\nan example of the architectural variety known as freestone, which is\r\nmerely a fine-grained, light-colored, uniform sandstone, not very hard,\r\nand breaking with about equal freedom in all directions. The\r\nconsolidation of sandstones is due chiefly to chemical action. The\r\ncementing materials are commonly either: _ferruginous_ (iron oxides),\r\ngiving red or brown sandstones; _calcareous_, forming soft sandstones,\r\nwhich effervesce with acid if the cement is abundant; or _siliceous_,\r\nmaking very strong, light-colored sandstones. Ferruginous sandstones are\r\nthe most valuable for architectural purposes; for, while not excessively\r\nhard, they have a very durable cement. Siliceous sandstones are too\r\nhard; and the calcareous varieties crumble when exposed to the weather\r\nbecause the cement is soluble in water containing carbon dioxide, as all\r\nrain-water does. Specimen 32 is a good example of a ferruginous\r\nsandstone, and it is coarse enough so that we can see that each grain of\r\nquartz is coated with the red oxide of iron. The mica scales visible\r\nhere and there in this specimen are interesting as showing that the\r\ngrains are not necessarily all quartz; and it is important to observe\r\nthat the mica was not made in the sandstone, but, like the quartz, has\r\ncome from some older rock.\r\n\r\nQuartzite.—This rock is simply an unusually hard sandstone. Now the\r\nhardness of any rock depends upon two things: (1) the hardness of the\r\nindividual grains or particles; and (2) the firmness with which they are\r\nunited one to another. Therefore, the hardest sandstones must be those\r\nin which grains of quartz are combined with an abundant siliceous\r\ncement; and that is precisely what we have in a typical quartzite, such\r\nas specimen 33. Quartzite is distinguished, in the hand-specimen, from\r\nordinary quartz by its granular texture (compare specimens 15 and 33);\r\nand of course in large masses the stratification is an important\r\ndistinguishing feature.\r\n\r\n3. _Argillaceous group._—Just as the conglomerate group shades off\r\ngradually into the arenaceous group, so we find it difficult to draw any\r\nsharp line of division between the arenaceous group and the\r\nargillaceous, but we pass from the largest pebble to the most minute\r\nclay-particle by an insensible gradation. For the sake of convenience,\r\nhowever, we draw the line at the limit of visibility, and say that in\r\nthe true clay and slate the individual particles are invisible to the\r\nnaked eye; in other words, these rocks have a perfectly compact texture,\r\nwhile the two preceding groups are characterized by a granular texture.\r\nAlthough clay, like sand and gravel, may be of almost any composition,\r\nyet it usually consists chiefly, often entirely, of the mineral kaolin.\r\nThe reason for this is easily found. Quartz resists both mechanical and\r\nchemical forces, and is rarely reduced to an impalpable fineness; but\r\nall the other common minerals, such as feldspar, hornblende, mica, and\r\ncalcite, on account of their cleavage and inferior hardness, are easily\r\npulverized; but it is practically impossible that this should happen\r\nwithout their being broken up chemically at the same time. Decomposition\r\nfollows disintegration; and, while calcite is completely dissolved and\r\ncarried away, the other minerals are reduced, as we have seen, to\r\nimpalpable hydrous silicates of aluminum, _i.e._, to kaolin. Hence, we\r\nfind that the fragmental rocks are composed principally of two minerals,\r\nquartz and kaolin,—the former predominating in the conglomerate and\r\narenaceous groups, and the latter in the argillaceous group.\r\n\r\nClay.—That kaolin is the basis of common clay is proved by the\r\nargillaceous odor, which is so characteristic of moist clay. Pure kaolin\r\nclay is white and impalpable, like China clay; but pure clays are the\r\nexception. They often become coarse and gritty by admixture with sand,\r\nforming _loam_; and they also usually contain more or less carbonaceous\r\nmatter, which makes black clays; or more or less _ferrous_ oxide, which\r\nmakes blue clays; or more or less _ferric_ oxide, which makes red,\r\nbrown, and yellow clays. By mixing these coloring materials in various\r\nproportions, almost any tint may be explained. Clays are sometimes\r\ncalcareous, from the presence of shells and shell-fragments or of\r\npulverized limestone. These usually effervesce with acid, and are\r\ncommonly known as _marl_. It is the calcareous material in a pulverulent\r\nand easily soluble condition that makes the marls valuable as soils.\r\n\r\nSlate.—Consolidated clay. The compact texture and argillaceous odor are\r\nusually sufficient to prove this. To get the odor we need simply to\r\nbreathe upon the specimen, and then smell of it. We find all degrees of\r\ninduration in clay. It sometimes, as every one knows, becomes very hard\r\nby simple drying; but this is not slate, and no amount of mere drying\r\nwill change clay into slate; for, when moistened with water, the dried\r\nclay is easily brought back to the plastic state. To make a good slate,\r\nthe induration must be the result of pressure, aided probably to some\r\nextent by heat. True slate, then, is a permanently indurated clay which\r\nwill not soak up and become soft when wet.\r\n\r\nSlate is usually easily scratched with a knife, and it is distinguished\r\nfrom limestone by its non-effervescence with acid. As we should expect,\r\nit shows precisely the same varieties in color and composition as clay.\r\nA good assortment of colors is afforded by the roofing-slates. Specimen\r\n34 is a typical slate, for it not only has a compact texture and\r\nargillaceous odor, but it is very distinctly stratified. The\r\nstratification is marked by alternating bands of slightly different\r\ncolors, and is much finer and more regular than we usually observe in\r\nsandstone, and of course entirely unlike the stratification of\r\nconglomerate. These differences are characteristic. Some slates,\r\nhowever, are so homogeneous that the stratification is scarcely visible\r\nin small pieces. Thus the roofing-slates (specimen 35) rarely show the\r\nstratification; for it is an important fact that the thin layers into\r\nwhich this variety splits are entirely independent of the\r\nstratification. This is the structure known as slaty cleavage; it is not\r\ndue to the stratification, but is developed in the slate subsequently to\r\nits deposition, by pressure. Some roofing-slates, known as\r\nribbon-slates, show bands of color across the flat surfaces. These bands\r\nare the true bedding, and indicate the absolute want of conformity\r\nbetween this structure and the cleavage. Few rocks are richer in fossils\r\nthan slate, and these prove that it is a stratified rock. Slate which\r\nsplits easily into thin layers _parallel with the bedding_ is known as\r\n_shale_.\r\n\r\nPorcelainite.—This is clay or slate which has been baked or partially\r\nvitrified by heat so as to have the hardness and texture of porcelain.\r\n\r\n2. CHEMICALLY AND ORGANICALLY FORMED ROCKS.—We have already learned that\r\nfrom a geological point of view the differences between chemical and\r\norganic deposition are not great, the process being essentially chemical\r\nin each case; and since the limestones and some other important rocks\r\nare deposited in both ways, it is evidently not only unnatural, but\r\nfrequently impossible, to separate the chemically from the organically\r\nformed rocks. Unlike the fragmental rocks, the rocks of this division\r\nnot only admit, but require, a chemical classification. This is natural\r\nbecause they are of chemical origin; and it is practicable because, with\r\nfew exceptions, only one class of minerals is deposited at the same time\r\nin the same place,—a very convenient and important fact. Therefore our\r\narrangement will be mineralogical, thus:—\r\n\r\n                   (1) Coal Group.\r\n                   (2) Iron-ore Group.\r\n                   (3) Siliceous Group.\r\n                   (4) Calcareous Group.\r\n                   (5) Metamorphic Group (Silicates).\r\n\r\nMost of the silicate rocks are mixed, _i.e._, are each composed of\r\nseveral minerals; but some silicate rocks and all the rocks of the other\r\ndivisions are simple, each species consisting of a single mineral only.\r\n\r\n(1) _Coal Group._—These are entirely of organic origin, and include two\r\nallied series, which are always merely the more or less extensively\r\ntransformed tissues of plants or animals; viz.:—\r\n\r\nCoals and Bitumens.—At the first lesson we examined a sample of peat\r\n(specimen 8), and considered the general conditions of its formation,\r\npeat being in every instance simply partially decayed marsh\r\nvegetation. It was also stated that, as during the lapse of time the\r\ntransformation becomes more complete, the peat is changed in\r\nsuccession to _lignite_, _bituminous coal_, _anthracite_, and\r\n_graphite_. The coals, indeed, make a very beautiful and perfect\r\nseries, whether we consider the composition—there being a gradual,\r\nprogressive change from the composition of ordinary woody fibre in the\r\nnewest peat to the pure carbon in graphite,—or the degree of\r\nconsolidation and mineralization—since there is a gradual passage from\r\nthe light, porous peat, showing distinctly the vegetable forms, to the\r\nheavy crystalline graphite, bearing no trace of its vegetable origin.\r\nThis relation is easily appreciated by a child, if a proper series of\r\nspecimens is presented. The coals also make a chronological series,\r\ngraphite and anthracite occurring only in the older formations, and\r\nlignite and peat in the newer, while bituminous coal is found in\r\nformations of intermediate age.\r\n\r\nBituminous coal is the typical, the representative coal; and from a good\r\nspecimen of this variety we may learn two important facts:—\r\n\r\n(1) That true coals, no less than peat, are of vegetable origin. To see\r\nthis we must look at the flat or charcoal surfaces of the coal. These\r\nsoil the fingers like charcoal, and usually show the vegetable forms\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\n(2) That coals are stratified rocks. These dirty charcoal surfaces\r\nalways coincide with the stratification, being merely the successive\r\nlayers of vegetation deposited and pressed together to build up the\r\ncoal; and when we look at the edge of the specimen the stratification\r\nshows plainly enough.\r\n\r\nThe bitumens form a similar though less perfect series, beginning with\r\nthe organic tissues, and ending, in the opinion of some of the best\r\nchemists and mineralogists, with diamond. In fact the coals and bitumens\r\nform two distinct but parallel series. The coals are exclusively of\r\nvegetable origin, while the bitumens are largely of animal origin. The\r\norganic tissues in which the two series originate are chemically\r\nsimilar,—the animal tissues, which produce the lighter forms of bitumen,\r\nhowever, containing more hydrogen and less carbon and oxygen than\r\nvegetable tissues; while the final terms, as just shown, are probably\r\nchemically identical, being pure carbon,—graphite for the coals and\r\ndiamond for the bitumens; so that the entire process of change in each\r\nseries is essentially carbonization, a gradual elimination of the\r\ngaseous elements, oxygen and hydrogen, until pure solid carbon alone\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nThe principal differences between the coals and bitumens are the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n    Coals are rich in carbon, with some oxygen and little\r\n        hydrogen.\r\n\r\n    Bitumens are rich in hydrogen, with some carbon and little\r\n        or no oxygen.\r\n\r\n    Coals are entirely insoluble.\r\n\r\n    Bitumens are soluble in ether, benzole, turpentine, etc.,\r\n        and the solid forms are soluble in the more fluid,\r\n        naphtha-like varieties.\r\n\r\n    Coals are never liquid, and cannot be melted or, with\r\n        trifling exceptions, even softened by heat.\r\n\r\n    Many bitumens are naturally liquid, and all become so on the\r\n        application of heat.\r\n\r\n    The coals partake of the characteristics of their chief\r\n        constituent element, carbon, the most thoroughly solid\r\n        substance known; while the bitumens similarly show the\r\n        influence of hydrogen, the most perfectly fluid\r\n        substance known.\r\n\r\nThe two bitumens of the greatest geological importance are asphaltum or\r\nmineral pitch and petroleum; but these substances are too familiar to\r\nrequire any farther description here.\r\n\r\n(2) _Iron-ore Group._—These interesting and important stratified rocks\r\ninclude the three principal oxides of iron,—limonite, hematite, and\r\nmagnetite,—as well as the carbonate of iron, siderite; and the rocks\r\nhave essentially the same characteristics as the minerals. In economical\r\nimportance they are second only to the coals; and the history of their\r\nformation through the agency of organic matter is one of the most\r\ninteresting chapters in chemical geology (see page 26). The three oxides\r\nare easily distinguished from each other by the colors of their powders\r\nor streaks, and the magnetism of magnetite, and from all other common\r\nrocks by their high specific gravity. Magnetite is the richest in iron,\r\nand limonite the poorest. As regards the degree of crystallization and\r\norder of occurrence in the formations, they form a series parallel with\r\nthe coal series, thus:—\r\n\r\n    Limonite, never crystalline, and found in recent formations.\r\n\r\n    Hematite, often crystalline, and found in older formations.\r\n\r\n    Magnetite, always crystalline, and found in oldest\r\n        formations.\r\n\r\nSiderite effervesces with strong acid; and this separates it from all\r\nother rocks, except limestone and dolomite; and from these it is\r\ndistinguished by its high specific gravity. As a mineral, siderite is\r\noften light colored; but as a rock it is always dark, and usually black,\r\nfrom admixture chiefly of carbonaceous matter. In studying dynamical\r\ngeology, we have learned (page 28) the reason for the intimate\r\nassociation of siderite with beds of coal, and this accounts equally for\r\nthe carbon contained in the rock itself. The connection of this rock\r\nwith the coal-formations adds much to its value as an ore of iron.\r\n\r\nFinally, the iron-ores, at least where of much economical importance,\r\nare truly stratified. This can often be seen in hand-specimens; and is\r\nwell shown by their relations to other rocks, in quarries and mines; and\r\nin many cases, for limonite and hematite, by the fossils which they\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\n(3) _Siliceous Group._—These rocks are composed of pure silica in the\r\nforms of quartz and opal. When first deposited, whether organically,\r\nlike tripolite, or chemically, like siliceous tufa, the siliceous rocks\r\nare soft and light, and the silica is in the form of opal. Subsequently\r\nit changes to quartz, and the rocks assume the much harder and denser\r\nforms of chert and novaculite, respectively.\r\n\r\nTripolite or Diatomaceous Earth.—This interesting rock is soft, light,\r\nand looks like clay; but it is lighter, and the argillaceous odor is\r\nfaint or wanting. It does not effervesce with acid. Hence, it is neither\r\nclay nor chalk. Notwithstanding its softness, it is really composed of a\r\nhard substance, viz., silica, in the form known as opal. By rubbing off\r\na little of the dust, and examining it under the microscope, we easily\r\nprove that the silica is mainly or entirely of organic origin; for the\r\ndust is seen to be simply a mass of more or less fragmentary organic\r\nremains, occurring in great variety, and of wonderful beauty and\r\nminuteness. There are few rocks so unpromising on the exterior, and yet\r\nso beautiful within. We have already learned that these organic bodies\r\nare principally Diatom cases, Radiolaria shells, and Sponge spicules. We\r\ncan form some idea of their minuteness from Ehrenberg’s estimate that a\r\nsingle cubic inch of pure tripolite contained no less than\r\n41,000,000,000 organisms.\r\n\r\nThe lightness of tripolite (sp. gr., 1-1.5) is due to the facts that\r\nopal is a light mineral (sp. gr., 1.9-2.2), and that many of the shells\r\nare hollow. Tripolite is a good example of a soft rock composed of a\r\nhard mineral; and it owes its value as a polishing material to the fact\r\nthat it consists of a hard mineral in an exceedingly fine state of\r\ndivision. Tripolite, when pure, is snow-white; but it is rarely pure,\r\nbeing commonly either argillaceous or calcareous. This rock is now\r\nforming in thousands of places, in both fresh water and the ocean.\r\n\r\nFlint and Chert.—During the course of geological time, beds of tripolite\r\nare gradually consolidated, chiefly by percolating waters, which are\r\nconstantly dissolving and re-depositing the silica; and, finally, in the\r\nplace of a soft, earthy rock, we get a hard, flinty one, which we call\r\n_flint_ if it occurs in the newer, or _chert_ if it occurs in the older,\r\ngeological formations. Besides forming beds of nearly pure silica, which\r\nwe call tripolite, the microscopic siliceous organisms are diffused more\r\nor less abundantly through other rocks, especially chalk and limestone.\r\nIn such cases the consolidation of the silica implies its segregation\r\nalso; _i.e._, the silica dissolved by percolating water is deposited\r\nonly about certain points in the rock, building up rounded concretions\r\nor nodules. Thus, a siliceous limestone becomes, by the segregation of\r\nthe silica, a pure limestone containing nodules of chert, which are\r\nusually arranged in lines parallel with the stratification. Specimen 16\r\nis a fragment of a flint-nodule from the chalk-formation of England.\r\n\r\nSiliceous Tufa.—Hot water, and especially hot alkaline water,\r\ncirculating through the earth’s crust, is always charged with silica\r\ndissolved out of the rocks; and when such water issues on the surface in\r\na hot spring or geyser, it is cooled by contact with the air, its\r\nsolvent power is diminished thereby, and a large part of the silica is\r\ndeposited around the outlet as a snowy-white porous material called\r\n_siliceous tufa_. Silica deposited in this way is, like organic silica,\r\nalways in the form of opal. Siliceous tufa is distinguished from clay,\r\nslate, chalk, and limestone by the same tests as tripolite, and from\r\ntripolite itself by the absence of microscopic organisms.\r\n\r\nNovaculite.—Through the action of percolating water and pressure,\r\nsiliceous tufa, like tripolite, becomes harder and denser and is thus\r\nchanged to _novaculite_, which holds the same relation to chemically\r\ndeposited silica that chert and flint do to organically deposited\r\nsilica. The white novaculite obtained at the Hot Springs of Arkansas,\r\nand commonly known as Arkansas stone, is a typical example of this rock.\r\nThe rock which, on account of the use to which it is put, is known as\r\nbuhr-stone, is also an excellent example of chemically deposited silica.\r\nIt is usually somewhat porous and fossiliferous.\r\n\r\n(4) _Calcareous Group._—These are the lime-rocks, including the\r\ncarbonate of lime, in limestone and dolomite, the sulphate of lime, in\r\ngypsum, and the phosphate of lime, in phosphate rock. These rocks are\r\neven more closely connected in origin than in composition; and it is for\r\nthis reason that rock-salt, which of course contains no lime, is also\r\nincluded in this group. Limestones are formed abundantly in the open\r\nsea, through the accumulation of shells and corals; but when portions of\r\nthe sea become detached from the main body and gradually dry up, like\r\nthe Dead Sea and Great Salt Lake, dolomite, gypsum, and rock-salt are\r\ndeposited in succession as chemical precipitates. Phosphate rock may be\r\nregarded as a variety of limestone, resulting from the accumulation of\r\nthe skeletons and excrement of the higher animals.\r\n\r\nLimestone.—This is the lithologic or rock form of carbonate of lime or\r\ncalcite, and one of the most important, interesting, and useful of all\r\nrocks. Although so simple in composition,—calcite being the only\r\nessential constituent,—limestone embraces many distinct varieties, and\r\nis really equivalent to a whole family of rocks. A highly fossiliferous\r\nlimestone, such as specimen 38, is, perhaps, the best variety with which\r\nto begin the study of the species. The softness of the fossil shells of\r\nwhich the rock is so largely composed, and the fact that they effervesce\r\nreadily with dilute acid, proves that they are still carbonate of lime;\r\nand by applying the acid more carefully, it can be seen that the compact\r\nmatrix of the rock also effervesces, consisting of shells more finely\r\nbroken or comminuted and mixed with more or less clay and other\r\nimpurity, almost the entire rock being of organic origin.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Florida, and in many other places, we find beautiful\r\nexamples of shell-limestone now in process of formation. These are at\r\nfirst very open and porous, because the interstices between the nearly\r\nentire shells are not yet filled up with smaller fragments and sand. But\r\nwhen that is done, we shall have a rock similar to the old fossiliferous\r\nlimestone. Specimen 37.\r\n\r\nThe shells and fragments, and the grains of calcareous sand, are, as a\r\nrule, quickly cemented together by the deposition of carbonate of lime\r\nbetween them; so that limestone is nowhere observed occurring abundantly\r\nin an unconsolidated form.\r\n\r\nLimestone, as a rule, is not distinctly stratified in hand-specimens,\r\nbut of course that it is a true sedimentary rock is abundantly proved by\r\nthe fossils; and it goes almost without saying that limestone, being\r\nnecessarily mainly composed of organic remains, must be to a greater\r\nextent than any other rock the great store-house of fossils; and in no\r\nother rock are the fossils so well preserved and perfect as in\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are extensive formations of limestone containing no\r\ndiscernible traces of fossils. And some of these non-fossiliferous\r\nlimestones, too, are of very recent formation. Some of the modern\r\ncoral-reefs, for example, are composed of limestone which was formed\r\nonly yesterday, as it were, and which, from its mode of formation, must\r\nconsist entirely of corals; and yet it shows no trace of its organic\r\norigin, but is perfectly compact, or, possibly, crystalline. This\r\nfrequent obliteration of the organic remains, as well as the perfect\r\nconsolidation of the rock, is attributed to its solubility. The calcium\r\ncarbonate is gradually dissolved by the water, and then deposited in the\r\ninterstices in other parts of the rock.\r\n\r\nSpecimen 39 is that variety of limestone known as _chalk_. It is soft\r\nand earthy, resembling both clay and tripolite, but differing from the\r\nformer in lacking the distinct argillaceous odor, and from both by its\r\nlively effervescence with acids. It appears to be entirely destitute of\r\norganic remains, but this is a defect of our vision and not of the rock;\r\nfor, like the tripolite, it often appears under the microscope to be\r\nlittle else than a mass of shells. Tripolite is a deposit built up of\r\nthe siliceous shells of Diatoms and Radiolaria, while chalk is chiefly\r\ncomposed of the similar but calcareous shells of Foraminifera. Our\r\nspecimen is from the Cretaceous formation of England; but we have good\r\nreason to believe that chalk is _now forming_ on a very extensive scale.\r\nThere are millions of square miles in the deeper parts of the ocean\r\nwhere the dredge brings up little else but a perfectly impalpable, gray,\r\ncalcareous slime or ooze. When examined microscopically, this is seen to\r\nbe composed chiefly of Foraminifera shells, and among these the genus\r\nGlobigerina predominates; so that the deposit is frequently called\r\nGlobigerina ooze. Now this gray, calcareous ooze, when dried and\r\ncompacted by pressure, makes a soft, _white_ rock which can scarcely be\r\ndistinguished from chalk; in fact, it is a modern chalk. And there seems\r\nno good reason to doubt that the deposition of chalk has gone on\r\ncontinuously since Cretaceous time—for several millions of years at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nSpecimen 40 is also a white rock, easily scratched with the knife, and\r\neffervescing freely with acid, and therefore a variety of limestone. But\r\nits texture is very different from the other varieties we have studied.\r\nIt has a sparkling surface, which we explain by saying that the rock is\r\ncrystalline. It is, in fact, a mass of minute crystals of calcite. The\r\ncrystalline limestones have not always been crystalline, but it is safe\r\nto assume that they were originally entirely uncrystalline, and in many\r\ncases rich in fossils; but the fossils have been mainly obliterated by\r\nthe crystallization.\r\n\r\nCrystallization generally in rocks is an indication of great age, so\r\nthat we usually say crystalline rocks must be older than uncrystalline\r\nrocks of the same composition; and this is mainly true with the\r\nlimestones. When the crystallization is rather fine, as in our specimen,\r\nresembling granulated sugar, we have what is commonly called\r\nsaccharoidal limestone. This is the typical marble. Marble is not a\r\nscientific name, and the term is usually applied to any calcareous rock\r\nwhich will take a polish, and sometimes even to rocks which are not\r\ncalcareous at all.\r\n\r\nIn the section on dynamical geology, we learned that the carbonate of\r\ncalcium or calcite is deposited from the sea-water, and limestones\r\nformed, in two ways: first, in a purely chemical way, where the water\r\nbecomes saturated with calcite; and, second, organically, where the\r\ncalcium carbonate is taken from the water by marine organisms to form\r\ntheir shells and skeletons, and the gradual accumulation of these on the\r\nocean-floor builds up a limestone. As before stated, the difference\r\nbetween these two methods of deposition is not so great as it often\r\nseems, because we know that the animals never make the carbonate of\r\ncalcium which they secrete, but it comes into the sea ready made with\r\nthe drainage from the land.\r\n\r\nThe limestones forming at the present time are almost wholly organic;\r\nbut the rock known as _calcareous tufa_ is an exception. This is formed\r\nunder the same general conditions as siliceous tufa, but much more\r\nabundantly, and in cold water as well as warm; because calcite is far\r\nmore soluble (especially in water containing carbon dioxide) than opal\r\nor quartz. It is deposited, not only around the mouths of springs, but\r\nalso along the beds of the streams which they form, enveloping stones,\r\nroots, grasses, etc., and building up usually a loose, spongy mass\r\nhaving a very characteristic turfaceous texture.\r\n\r\nThe principal accessory minerals occurring in limestone are: (1)\r\n_kaolin_, forming argillaceous or slaty limestone, which may be\r\nrecognized by the argillaceous odor and dark color; (2) _quartz_,\r\nforming siliceous or cherty limestone, known by its hardness or by the\r\nnodules of flint or chert; (3) _dolomite_, forming dolomitic or\r\nmagnesian limestone, which effervesces less freely with acid; and (4)\r\n_serpentine_, forming serpentinic limestone, which is sharply\r\ndistinguished by the green grains of serpentine mingled with the white\r\ncalcite. A concretionary texture is common with limestone. If the\r\nconcretions are small, like mustard-seed, we call the rock _oölite_; if\r\nlarger, like peas, _pisolite_.\r\n\r\nDolomite.—If for calcite, which is the sole essential constituent of all\r\nlimestone, we substitute the allied mineral dolomite, we have the rock\r\ndolomite. As might be inferred from its composition, dolomite is very\r\nclosely related to limestone, although there are some important\r\ndifferences. Physically, the two rocks differ about as the two minerals\r\ndo. Dolomite is harder than limestone, and being also less soluble, it\r\nresists the action of the weather more. Dolomite, if pure, effervesces\r\nfeebly, or not at all, with cold dilute acid. Here, however, we have to\r\nrecognize the fact that dolomite is rarely pure; but there exists, in\r\nconsequence of the admixture of calcite, a perfectly gradual passage\r\nfrom pure dolomite to pure limestone, and parallel with this every\r\ndegree of vigor in the reaction with acid. Hence, it is entirely an\r\narbitrary matter as to where we shall draw the line between dolomitic\r\nlimestone and calcareous dolomite. Dolomite is a very much less abundant\r\nrock than limestone, and, unlike limestone, it rarely contains many\r\nfossils, and is never of organic origin; _i.e._, there are no organisms\r\nwhich secrete the mineral dolomite to form their hard parts or\r\nskeletons. Like gypsum and rock-salt, dolomite is probably never\r\ndeposited in the open ocean, but only in closed basins. Like limestone,\r\nit occurs with both the compact and the crystalline textures.\r\n\r\nGypsum.—When pure, this rock (specimen 36) is identical with the mineral\r\ngypsum (specimen 17), except that it is rarely crystalline. It is\r\nusually, however, not only perfectly compact, but more or less\r\ndark-colored from the admixture of clay and other impurities. Its most\r\nnotable characteristics are its softness, the absence of the\r\nargillaceous odor, except where it contains much clayey impurity, and\r\nits non-effervescence with acids. The first two usually serve to\r\ndistinguish it from slate, while the acid test separates it readily from\r\nlimestone and all other carbonate rocks. The deposition of gypsum is\r\npurely chemical, and it occurs under about the same physical conditions\r\nas the deposition of salt; _i.e._, in drying-up portions of the sea.\r\nHence we usually find gypsum associated with beds of rock-salt; and,\r\nsince drying-up seas are few in number, and small compared with the\r\nwhole extent of the ocean, we can easily understand why neither\r\nrock-salt nor gypsum are abundant rocks, except in a few localities.\r\n\r\nRock-Salt.—This interesting and useful rock, as we have already learned,\r\nis deposited in a purely chemical way, and only in drying-up portions of\r\nthe sea, like the Dead Sea, Great Salt Lake, etc. In some parts of\r\nEurope there are beds of solid rock-salt over a hundred feet thick.\r\n\r\nPhosphate Rock.—Although not specially abundant or attractive, this rock\r\nis of great economic interest and importance on account of its extensive\r\nuse as a fertilizer. Under the general head of phosphate rock are\r\nincluded: (1) the typical guano, which is the consolidated excrement of\r\ncertain marine birds inhabiting in great numbers small coral islands in\r\nthe dry or rainless regions of the tropics; (2) the underlying coral\r\nrock, which is often changed to phosphate rock through the percolation\r\nof the rain-water falling on the guano; (3) accumulations of the bones\r\nand coprolites of the higher animals; (4) phosphatic limestones from\r\nwhich the carbonate of lime has been largely dissolved away, leaving the\r\nmore insoluble phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n(5) _Metamorphic Group_ (stratified silicates).—All the chemically and\r\norganically formed rocks which we have studied up to this point are\r\nsimple, _i.e._, they consist each of only one essential mineral; but\r\nmost of the rocks in this great group of silicates are mixed, or consist\r\neach of several essential minerals. Quartz is the only important\r\nconstituent of these rocks which is not, strictly speaking, a silicate,\r\nbut in a certain sense it is also not an exception, since it may always\r\nbe regarded as an excess of acid in the rock.\r\n\r\nThis group of stratified rocks composed of silicate minerals is of\r\nexceptional importance, first, on account of the large number of species\r\nwhich it includes, and, second, on account of the vast abundance of some\r\nof the species. These are, above all others, the rocks of which the\r\nearth’s crust is composed. With unimportant exceptions, all the rocks of\r\nthis group are crystalline; and they constitute the principal part of\r\nwhat is generally included under the term _metamorphic rocks_—a general\r\nname for all stratified rocks which have been so acted upon by heat,\r\npressure, or chemical forces as to make them crystalline. Although the\r\ncrystalline limestone, dolomite, iron-ores, etc., show us that\r\nmetamorphic rocks are not wanting in the other groups.\r\n\r\nAs already explained, the metamorphic or crystalline stratified rocks\r\nare usually older than the corresponding uncrystalline rocks; but a\r\npoint of greater importance here is this: the development in the\r\nsilicate rocks of crystalline characters has usually made it impossible\r\nto determine the method of their deposition, whether mechanical or\r\nchemical. In a few cases, as with the rock greensand, we know that the\r\ndeposition is chemical; while it is equally certain that such common\r\nsilicate rocks as gneiss, mica schist, and many others, often result\r\nfrom the crystallization of ordinary mechanical sediments, like\r\nsandstone and conglomerate. We classify all these rocks as of chemical\r\norigin, however, without considering the mode of their deposition,\r\nbecause the subsequent crystallization is itself essentially a chemical\r\nprocess; and that justifies us in saying that these rocks are made what\r\nthey now are chiefly by the action of chemical forces. Whatever they\r\nwere originally, they have become, through their crystallization, rocks\r\nhaving a definite mineral composition which can be classified\r\nchemically.\r\n\r\nSome of the details of the classification of this group, as shown in the\r\ntable, require explanation. In studying the silicate minerals it was\r\nstated to be important to recognize two classes—the _acidic_ and the\r\n_basic_—the dividing line falling in the neighborhood of 60 per cent. of\r\nsilica. This division is important simply because Nature has in a great\r\ndegree kept the acidic and basic minerals separate in the rocks; and few\r\nthings in lithology are more important than the distinction of the\r\nsilicate rocks in which acidic minerals predominate from those in which\r\nbasic minerals predominate. The amount of silica which any rock of this\r\ngroup contains is shown at a glance by the chart. The vertical broken\r\nlines, with the figures at the top, indicate the proportion of silica,\r\nwhich increases from 30 per cent. on the right to 85 per cent. on the\r\nleft; so that the percentage of silica which a rock contains determines\r\nits position, the acidic species being on the left, and the basic on the\r\nright. As most of these rocks are composed of two or more minerals mixed\r\nin very various proportions, there is usually a wide range in the\r\npercentage of silica which the same species may contain; and this is\r\nexpressed in each case by the length of the dotted line under the name\r\nof the rock. Thus, in syenite, the silica ranges from 55 per cent. to 65\r\nper cent. The horizontal line in the chart separates the gneisses,\r\ncontaining feldspar as an essential constituent, from the schists, in\r\nwhich feldspar is wanting, except as an accessory constituent. We will\r\ntake up the gneisses first.\r\n\r\nGneiss.—This is the most important of all rocks. It forms not far from\r\none-half of New England, and a very large proportion of the earth’s\r\ncrust. The name (pronounced same as _nice_) is known to have originated\r\namong the Saxon miners, but its precise derivation is lost in obscurity.\r\nTo find out what this very important rock is, we will consult specimen\r\n41. The first glance shows us that it is not, like the rocks we have\r\njust been studying, composed of a single mineral, but of several\r\nminerals, the most conspicuous of which is the pink feldspar—orthoclase.\r\nThis we recognize as a feldspar: (1) by its hardness, which is a little\r\nless than that of quartz, and distinguishes it from calcite, a mineral\r\nhaving the general appearance of feldspar; (2) by its color, which\r\nseparates it from hornblende and augite; and (3) by its cleavage, which\r\ndistinguishes it easily from quartz. Finally, we know it is orthoclase,\r\nand not plagioclase, by its general aspect, and by its association with\r\nan abundance of quartz, which is the next most important constituent of\r\nthe rock. The quartz is less abundant than the orthoclase, and more\r\neasily overlooked, yet anyone familiar with the mineral will not fail to\r\nrecognize it. It forms small, irregular, glassy grains, entirely devoid\r\nof cleavage, and scratching glass easily. On weathered surfaces of the\r\nrock the orthoclase becomes soft and chalky, while the quartz remains\r\nclear and hard, and then the two minerals are very easily distinguished.\r\nBesides these, there are numerous black, thin, glistening scales, which\r\nwe can easily prove to be elastic, and recognize as mica.\r\n\r\nIn most books on the subject, these three minerals—orthoclase, quartz,\r\nand mica—are set down as the normal or essential constituents of gneiss.\r\nBut it is now recognized by the best lithologists that we may have true\r\ngneiss without any mica; or we may have hornblende in the place of mica.\r\nQuartz and orthoclase are the only essential constituents of gneiss; and\r\nwhen these alone are present, we have the variety known as binary\r\ngneiss. The addition to these essential constituents of mica, gives\r\nmicaceous gneiss; and of hornblende, hornblendic gneiss. Of these three\r\nprincipal varieties, the micaceous gneiss is by far the most common and\r\nimportant. The mica may be either the white species, muscovite, or the\r\nblack species, biotite; but it is usually the former.\r\n\r\nOrthoclase is the predominant constituent in all typical gneiss, usually\r\nforming at least one-half of the rock. The orthoclase may, however, be\r\nreplaced to a greater or less extent by albite, or even by oligoclase.\r\nBut we frequently see the term _gneiss_ carelessly, or ignorantly,\r\napplied to rocks which are destitute of feldspar, though having the\r\ngeneral aspect of gneiss.\r\n\r\nAugite rarely occurs in gneiss; and hence, when we observe a gneiss\r\ncontaining a black mineral which we know is either augite or hornblende,\r\nit is pretty safe to call it the latter.\r\n\r\nMica and hornblende, although the principal, are not the only, accessory\r\nminerals in gneiss; but the following species are also of common\r\noccurrence: garnet, cyanite, tourmaline, fibrolite, epidote, and\r\nchlorite. Gneisses, as the table indicates, exhibit a wide range in the\r\nproportion of silica which they contain, varying from 60 to 85 per\r\ncent.; and there is a concomitant variation in specific gravity, from\r\nabout 2.5 in the most acidic to 2.8 in the most basic varieties.\r\n\r\nThat gneiss is a true, stratified rock is very clearly shown in specimen\r\n41; but, unfortunately, the stratification is not always so evident as\r\nin this case. The mica-scales, it will be observed, lie parallel with\r\nthe stratification, and assist very materially to make it visible; and\r\ngneisses containing little or no mica, as well as some that are rich in\r\nmica, frequently appear almost or quite unstratified. These obscurely\r\nstratified varieties are commonly known as granitoid gneiss, having the\r\ntexture and general aspect of granite. The sedimentary origin of gneiss\r\nis also clearly proved by its interstratification with undoubted\r\nsedimentary rocks, such as limestone, iron-ores, graphite, quartzite,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSyenite.—This is a much abused term, but, as now employed by the best\r\nlithologists, it is the name of a rock having a single essential\r\nconstituent, viz., orthoclase. Syenite in its simplest variety contains\r\nnothing but orthoclase; but in addition we usually have either\r\nhornblende, forming hornblendic syenite, or mica, forming micaceous\r\nsyenite.\r\n\r\nSyenite, it will be observed, is equivalent to gneiss with the quartz\r\nremoved; but, while gneiss is the most abundant of all rocks, syenite is\r\na comparatively rare rock; and this is simply another way of saying that\r\nnearly all orthoclase is associated with quartz. By admixture of quartz\r\nwe get a perfectly gradual passage from syenite to gneiss. The\r\northoclase in syenite is more frequently replaced by plagioclase than it\r\nis in gneiss. In syenite, too, hornblende is much more abundant than\r\nmica; although just the opposite is true in gneiss. And, again, in\r\ngneiss the mica is principally muscovite; but in syenite it is almost\r\nexclusively biotite. Augite is a common accessory in the more basic\r\nsyenite; but garnet, tourmaline, and the other accessory minerals,\r\noccurring so frequently in gneiss, are almost unknown in syenite. The\r\nspecific gravity of syenite varies from 2.7 to 2.9.\r\n\r\nDiorite.—This is a more important rock than syenite; but it is of\r\nanalogous, though more basic, composition, containing a single essential\r\nconstituent, viz., plagioclase. Any of the triclinic feldspars may occur\r\nin this rock, but oligoclase is most common. Like syenite, diorite\r\nusually contains hornblende, often in large proportion, forming\r\nhornblendic diorite, which sometimes passes into rocks composed entirely\r\nof hornblende. It also, but less frequently, contains mica, forming\r\nmicaceous diorite. The mica is usually biotite, rarely muscovite. Mica\r\nand hornblende also often occur together in diorite, and the same is\r\ntrue of syenite and gneiss. Quartz is of common occurrence in the more\r\nacidic varieties of diorite, and augite in the more basic.\r\n\r\nThis is a good example of a basic rock, for all its normal constituents\r\nare basic; but the percentage of silica varies from 45 in those\r\nvarieties richest in labradorite and augite to 60 or more in those\r\ncontaining more or less quartz and orthoclase. There is a corresponding\r\nchange of color from dark to light, and of specific gravity from 2.7 to\r\n3.1.\r\n\r\nDiorite is not rich in accessory minerals; besides those already\r\nmentioned, the most important are chlorite, epidote, pyrite, and\r\nmagnetite.\r\n\r\nFew rocks are more clearly stratified than diorite, whether we consider\r\nthe hand-specimen, or its relations to other formations. It is an\r\nabundant rock in New England.\r\n\r\nNorite.—Like diorite, this is essentially a plagioclase rock; but there\r\nare, nevertheless, important differences. The plagioclase in diorite is\r\nmainly the more acidic species, like oligoclase; while in norite the\r\nmore basic species, such as labradorite and anorthite, predominate.\r\nHornblende, which we have observed to be an important and rather\r\nconstant constituent of diorite and syenite, is much less abundant in\r\nnorite; but its place is taken by augite and the allied minerals,\r\nhypersthene and enstatite. Black mica is common in norite; but white\r\nmica, orthoclase, and quartz rarely occur.\r\n\r\nNorite is the most basic of all the feldspathic rocks, as gneiss is the\r\nmost acidic; while syenite and diorite stand as connecting links,\r\nforming a gradual passage between the two extremes. Thus, in passing\r\nfrom gneiss to norite, we have observed a gradual diminution of the\r\nquartz, a gradual change in feldspar from orthoclase to the most basic\r\nplagioclase; at first a gradual increase in hornblende, and then a\r\ngradual change from hornblende to augite; and, finally, a gradual\r\nsubstitution of black mica for white. The amount of silica has decreased\r\nover 40 per cent.; and the specific gravity has increased from 2.5 in\r\nthe lightest gneiss to at least 3.2 in the heaviest norite. We have also\r\npassed from light colored rocks to dark; and from those resisting\r\natmospheric action to those easily decomposed.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic accessory constituents of norite, besides those\r\nalready mentioned, are magnetite and chrysolite; though garnet,\r\nserpentine, and pyrite often occur. In texture, this rock varies from\r\ncompact to very coarsely crystalline. The specimen of labradorite (No.\r\n23), from the norite of Labrador, affords some idea of the coarseness of\r\nthe crystallization in much of this rock. It is not a common rock,\r\nexcept in certain regions, the best known of which in eastern North\r\nAmerica are the coast of Labrador, various points in Canada north of the\r\nSt. Lawrence, and the eastern border of the Adirondack Mountains. In\r\nhand-specimens, norite rarely appears stratified; but in the solid\r\nledges the stratification is often as distinct as could be desired.\r\n\r\nMany lithologists call the rocks here designated norite _gabbro_, and\r\nclass them all in the eruptive division as essentially a coarse variety\r\nof diabase. In a similar manner, diorite and syenite are denied a place\r\nin the sedimentary series. But the stratified plagioclase rocks seem to\r\nhave as strong a claim to recognition as gneiss.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the important and interesting division of the\r\nnon-feldspathic rocks or schists.\r\n\r\nMica Schist.—This is, next to gneiss, the most abundant rock in New\r\nEngland. Specimen 43 is a typical example, and from it we can readily\r\nlearn what mica schist is. A glance suffices to show that it is chiefly\r\ncomposed of mica, but not entirely; for, on carefully examining the\r\nedges of the specimen, we cannot fail to see thin layers of hard, glassy\r\nquartz interwoven with the mica. The quartz layers are short and\r\noverlapping, and we have here a good illustration of the schistose\r\ntexture; this is, in fact, a typical schist.\r\n\r\nMica schist usually consists, as in this instance, of mica and quartz;\r\nbut it may be composed of mica alone; and sometimes kaolin or clay takes\r\nthe place of the quartz, forming argillaceous mica schist. The mica in\r\nthe latter is usually in very fine scales and rather inconspicuous, and\r\nthe rock often passes into ordinary clay slate. Similarly, when the mica\r\nbecomes deficient in the quartzose mica schist, a passage into ordinary\r\nquartzite is the result. A little feldspar is sometimes present in the\r\nrock, which thus passes into micaceous gneiss. Specimen 43 contains\r\nseveral crystals of red garnet, giving the variety garnetiferous mica\r\nschist. There is no other rock that contains such a large variety of\r\nbeautiful accessory minerals as mica schist; and for the mineralogist it\r\nis one of the most attractive rocks. Few rocks are more distinctly\r\nstratified; and the stratification can usually be observed in\r\nhand-specimens. The mica in these rocks may be either muscovite or\r\nbiotite, or both; but the former is most common. No rock shows a greater\r\nvariation in the percentage of silica which it contains than mica\r\nschist, as we pass from varieties which are nearly all quartz to those\r\nwhich are nearly all mica.\r\n\r\nClosely related to mica schist is the rock now known as hydromica\r\nschist, in which the ordinary anhydrous micas are replaced by hydromica.\r\nIt is distinguished from mica schist by being somewhat softer, less\r\nharsh to the touch, and less lustrous. It is to be regarded usually as\r\nan incipient mica schist, which has not yet become anhydrous; though it\r\nmay sometimes be just the reverse; viz.: an old mica schist which has\r\nbecome hydrated through the action of meteoric waters. It contains fewer\r\naccessory minerals than mica schist.\r\n\r\nHornblende Schist.—This is a stratified aggregate of hornblende and\r\nquartz. The quartz is granular and in thin layers, as in mica schist;\r\nbut the micaceous structure is wanting, and consequently the rock does\r\nnot cleave readily in the direction of the bedding. The hornblende is\r\nmostly finely crystalline, but sometimes occurs in large, bladed\r\ncrystals. Garnet and some other minerals are of common occurrence in the\r\nrock; but it is not rich in accessories like mica schist. The chief\r\ndifficulty in recognizing this rock consists in determining whether the\r\nwhite mineral is all quartz or partly feldspar. In the latter case, of\r\ncourse, it becomes a hornblendic gneiss.\r\n\r\nAmphibolite (Hornblende Rock).—This is the name applied to a rock having\r\nhornblende as its sole essential constituent. Hornblende schist\r\nsometimes passes into amphibolite, through the absence of quartz; and so\r\ndoes diorite, when the feldspar is deficient or wanting. Specimen 20,\r\nthough small, is a typical example of this rock. The physical and\r\nchemical characteristics are essentially the same as for the mineral\r\nhornblende. The texture varies from coarsely to finely crystalline. The\r\ncrystals are usually short and thick, and lie in all directions in the\r\nrock, which is thus very massive, the schistose texture being entirely\r\nwanting, and the stratification rarely showing in small masses. Biotite\r\nis a common accessory in amphibolite, and garnet and magnetite\r\nfrequently occur.\r\n\r\nBy the substitution of augite for hornblende, in the description of\r\namphibolite, we get the much rarer, but otherwise very similar, rock,\r\n_pyroxenite_.\r\n\r\nTalc Schist (Steatite or Soapstone).—Although not abundant, this is a\r\nuseful and familiar rock. The composition is implied in the name; and by\r\ncomparing it with the specimen of talc (No. 58) we can readily see that\r\nthey are essentially identical. Typical talc schist is pure talc; but\r\nthe talc is often mixed with more or less quartz or feldspar; and mica,\r\nchlorite, hornblende, garnet, and other minerals are of common\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThis rock embraces two distinct varieties, the massive and the\r\nschistose, or foliated. The former is the common soapstone (specimen\r\n71), which is a confused mass of crystals lying in all directions, and\r\nwith no visible stratification in the small mass. In the latter, as in\r\nspecimen     , the talc scales lie in parallel planes, giving the rock a\r\nmicaceous structure, and causing it to split easily in the direction of\r\nthe stratification. The cleavage surfaces are often wavy or corrugated;\r\nand the same is true of all schistose rocks. Talc schist is easily\r\ndistinguished from all other rocks by its light-grayish or greenish\r\ncolor, combined with its extreme softness, and its smooth, slippery\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\nChlorite Schist.—The one essential constituent of this rock is chlorite,\r\nand the mineral specimen (No. 26) answers equally well as an example of\r\nthe rock. As with talc schist, quartz, feldspar, and hydromica are\r\nrarely entirely absent. Besides these, the principal accessories are\r\nhornblende, magnetite, garnet, and epidote. This rock also agrees with\r\ntalc schist in presenting two principal varieties, the massive and the\r\nschistose. It is easily distinguished from talc schist by its darker\r\ncolor and streak, which are very characteristic; while its green color,\r\nsoftness, and unctuous feel separate it from all other rocks.\r\n\r\nThis is the most basic of all the silicate rocks; but, in consequence of\r\ncontaining a large proportion of water, it is not the heaviest. It is,\r\nin fact, interesting and important to observe that all these hydrous\r\nsilicate rocks—talc schist, chlorite schist, greensand, and\r\nserpentine—are distinctly lighter in each case than anhydrous rocks\r\ncontaining the same proportion of silica. They are also notable, as a\r\nclass, for their softness, smooth feel, and green color.\r\n\r\nSerpentine.—As the name implies, this rock is simply the mineral\r\nserpentine occurring in large masses, and its characteristics are\r\nprecisely the same. It is fine-grained, massive, compact, rather soft,\r\nbut very tough, and varies in color from very dark green to light\r\ngreenish-yellow. The dark colors predominate, and specimen 25 is a\r\ntypical example.\r\n\r\nSerpentine is often intimately associated with limestone and dolomite.\r\nThe white veins running irregularly through the variety known as Verd\r\nAntique Marble, however, are not calcite, as commonly supposed, but\r\nmagnesite. They do not effervesce freely with cold, dilute acid, for the\r\nentire rock is magnesian, and it is probable have been at one time\r\nsimply cracks along which water holding carbon dioxide has penetrated,\r\nchanging the magnesia from a silicate to a carbonate.\r\n\r\nGeologists were, at one time, almost unanimous in the opinion that all\r\nserpentine is of eruptive origin; but now it is conceded by the great\r\nmajority to be in some cases a sedimentary rock. It is found\r\ninterstratified with gneiss, limestone, all the schists, and many other\r\nstratified rocks. When occupying the position of an eruptive it is never\r\nan original rock; but has been formed by the alteration, _in situ_, of\r\nsome basic anhydrous rock, most commonly olivine basalt.\r\n\r\nGreensand.—This rock (specimen 27) consists chiefly of the mineral\r\nglauconite, mingled usually with more or less sand, clay, or calcareous\r\nmatter. It is usually very friable, or in an entirely unconsolidated\r\nstate. It is most abundant in the newer geological formations,\r\nespecially the Cretaceous and Tertiary; and is, perhaps, the only one of\r\nthe stratified silicate rocks now forming on an extensive scale in the\r\nocean. Its value as a fertilizer, for which purpose it is extensively\r\nemployed, is due to the potash that it contains.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a systematic summary of the mineralogical composition of\r\nthe rocks of this great division of silicates; and this, combined with\r\nthe classification on page 69, presents in a condensed form all the more\r\nimportant facts contained in the preceding descriptions. Only the more\r\nconstant and normal constituents of the species are enumerated in each\r\ncase:—\r\n\r\n       ====================+====================================\r\n        Names of Species.  |       Constituent Minerals.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n                          ⎧| Orthoclase and Quartz.\r\n       Gneiss             ⎨| Orthoclase, Quartz, and Mica.\r\n                          ⎩| Orthoclase, Quartz, and Hornblende.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n                          ⎧| Orthoclase.\r\n       Syenite            ⎨| Orthoclase and Hornblende.\r\n                          ⎩| Orthoclase and Mica.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n                          ⎧| Plagioclase (chiefly Oligoclase).\r\n       Diorite            ⎨| Plagioclase and Hornblende.\r\n                          ⎩| Plagioclase and Mica.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n                          ⎧| Plagioclase (chiefly Labradorite).\r\n       Norite             ⎨| Plagioclase and Augite (Diallage).\r\n                          ⎩| Plagioclase and Mica.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n                          ⎧| Mica.\r\n       Mica Schist        ⎨| Mica and Quartz.\r\n                          ⎩| Mica and Kaolin.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n       Hornblende Schist   | Hornblende and Quartz.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n       Amphibolite         | Hornblende.\r\n       Pyroxenite          | Pyroxene.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n       Talc Schist         | Talc.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n       Chlorite Schist     | Chlorite.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n       Serpentine          | Serpentine.\r\n       --------------------+------------------------------------\r\n       Greensand           | Glauconite.\r\n       ====================+====================================\r\n\r\n\r\n                   2. Eruptive or Unstratified Rocks.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of this great class are formed by the cooling and\r\nsolidification of materials that have come up from a great depth in the\r\nearth’s crust in a melted and highly heated condition. When the fissures\r\nin the earth’s crust reach down to the great reservoirs of liquid rock,\r\nand the latter wells up and overflows on the surface, forming a volcano,\r\nthen we may, as was pointed out on page 33, divide the eruptive mass\r\ninto two parts: first, that which has actually flowed out on the\r\nsurface, and cooled and solidified in contact with the air, forming a\r\nlava flow; second, that which has failed to reach the surface, but\r\ncooled and solidified in the fissure, forming a dike.\r\n\r\nLava flows or volcanic rocks and dikes or plutonic rocks are identical\r\nin composition; but there is a vast difference in texture, due to the\r\nwidely different conditions under which the rocks have solidified. The\r\ndike or fissure rocks solidify under enormous pressure, and this makes\r\nthem heavy and solid—free from pores. They are surrounded on all sides\r\nby warm rocks: this causes them to cool very slowly, and allows the\r\nvarious minerals time to crystallize. Other things being equal, the\r\nslower the cooling the coarser the crystallization; and hence, the\r\ngreater the depth below the surface at which the cooling takes place,\r\nthe coarser the crystallization.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic rock, on the other hand, cools under very slight pressure;\r\nand the steam, which exists abundantly in nearly all igneous rocks at\r\nthe time of their eruption, is able to expand, forming innumerable small\r\nvesicles or bubbles in the liquid lava; and these remain when it has\r\nbecome solid. Cooling in contact with the air, the lava cools quickly,\r\nand has but little chance for crystallization. Hence, to sum up the\r\nmatter, we say: plutonic rocks are solid and crystalline; and volcanic\r\nrocks are usually porous or vesicular, and uncrystalline.\r\n\r\nAs we descend into the earth’s crust, it is perfectly manifest that the\r\nvolcanic must shade off insensibly into the dike rocks, and we find it\r\nimpossible to draw any but an arbitrary plane of division between them;\r\nbut this is no argument against this classification, for, as already\r\nstated, all is gradation in geology, and we experience just the same\r\ndifficulty in drawing a line between conglomerate and sandstone, or\r\nbetween gneiss and mica schist, as between the dike rocks and volcanic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nWe will now observe to what extent the distinctions between these two\r\ngreat classes of eruptives can be traced in the rocks themselves,\r\nbeginning with the dike rocks. But first it is important to notice the\r\ngeneral fact, clearly expressed in the classification, that, with\r\nperhaps some trifling exceptions which need not be mentioned here, all\r\neruptive rocks are silicates, and nearly all are feldspathic silicates.\r\nThey are of definite mineralogical composition, and, like the chemically\r\nand organically formed stratified rocks, can be classified chemically.\r\nBut, although there are eruptives corresponding closely in composition\r\nto the feldspathic silicates, which we have just studied, we find among\r\nthem little to represent the non-feldspathic silicates, and nothing\r\ncorresponding in composition to the limestones, dolomites, gypsum,\r\nflint, tripolite, siliceous tufa, iron-ores, bitumens or coals.\r\n\r\n1. PLUTONIC (DIKE) ROCKS.—These are also known as the _ancient_ eruptive\r\nrocks, and for this reason: It is impossible, of course, for us to\r\nobserve them except where they occur on or near the earth’s surface.\r\nBut, since they are formed wholly below the surface, and usually at\r\ngreat depths in the earth, it is evident that they can appear on the\r\nsurface only as the result of enormous erosion; and erosion is a slow\r\nprocess, demanding, in these cases, many thousands or millions of years.\r\nTherefore, the more ancient dike rocks alone are within our reach; those\r\nof recent formation being still deeply buried in the earth’s crust. It\r\nfollows, as a corollary to this explanation, that the coarseness of the\r\ncrystallization of any dike rock must be a rough measure of its age and\r\nof the amount of erosion which the region has suffered since its\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nAs regards composition, the dike rocks present, as already stated,\r\nessentially the same combinations of minerals as the feldspathic\r\nsilicates of the stratified series, but occurring under different\r\nphysical conditions and having a widely different origin. The only\r\nimportant difference in texture between the two classes of rocks is that\r\nthe sedimentary rocks are stratified and the dike rocks are not; and\r\nwhen we consider that the dike rocks sometimes present a laminated\r\nstructure that resembles stratification, while the sedimentary rocks\r\nfrequently appear unstratified, it is easy to understand why, in the\r\nabsence of any marked difference in composition, geologists have often\r\nfound it difficult to distinguish the two classes of rocks. We also find\r\nhere the explanation and the justification of the fact that the names of\r\nthe dike rocks are in most cases the same as those of the sedimentary\r\nrocks of similar composition.\r\n\r\nGranite.—Granite (from the Latin _granum_, a grain) is a\r\ncrystalline-granular rock, agreeing in composition with gneiss. The\r\nessential constituents are quartz and orthoclase; and when they alone\r\nare present we have the variety _binary granite_. Mica, however\r\n(commonly muscovite, sometimes biotite, and frequently both) is usually\r\nadded to these, forming _micaceous granite_ (specimen 44); and often\r\nhornblende, forming _hornblendic granite_ (specimen 45). The orthoclase\r\nis sometimes replaced in part by triclinic species, especially albite\r\nand oligoclase. Accessory minerals are not so abundant in granite as in\r\ngneiss; but, besides those named, garnet, tourmaline, pyrite, apatite,\r\nand chlorite are most common. Orthoclase is always the predominant\r\ningredient; and, except when there is much hornblende present, usually\r\ndetermines the color of the granite. Thus, specimens 44 and 45 are gray\r\nbecause they contain gray orthoclase; while all red granites contain red\r\nor pink orthoclase. The quartz has usually been the last of the\r\nconstituents to crystallize or solidify; and, having been thus obliged\r\nto adapt itself to the contours of the orthoclase and mica, it is rarely\r\nobserved in distinct crystals.\r\n\r\nIn texture, the granites vary from perfectly compact varieties,\r\napproaching petrosilex, to those which are so coarsely crystalline that\r\nsingle crystals of orthoclase measure several inches in length. Of\r\ncourse one of the most important things to be observed about granite,\r\nespecially in comparing it with gneiss, is the complete absence of\r\nanything like stratification; that, as before stated, being the only\r\nimportant distinction between the two rocks. Gneiss is the most abundant\r\nof all stratified rocks, and granite stands in the same relation to the\r\neruptive series.\r\n\r\nSyenite.—This is an instance where stratified and eruptive rocks,\r\nagreeing in composition, have the same name. That rocks consisting of\r\northoclase, of orthoclase and hornblende, or of orthoclase and mica,\r\n_i.e._, having the composition of syenite, do occur in both the eruptive\r\nand stratified series there can be no doubt. They should, however, have\r\ndistinct names on account of their unlike origins; and would have but\r\nfor the practical difficulty in determining, in many cases, whether the\r\nrock is stratified or not. The best that we can do now, when we desire\r\nto be specific, and have the necessary information, is to say stratified\r\nsyenite or eruptive syenite, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nDiorite.—Here, again, we find identity of names, as well as of\r\ncomposition, between the two great series. Eruptive diorite is an\r\nabundant and well known rock, and consists of the same minerals as\r\nstratified diorite combined in the same proportions. Diorite includes a\r\nlarge part of the dike rocks commonly known as “trap” and “greenstone.”\r\nThe principal accessories are chlorite, epidote, pyrite, magnetite,\r\napatite, and quartz. The texture varies from perfectly compact or\r\nfelsitic to coarsely crystalline; averaging, however, less coarse than\r\nsyenite and granite.\r\n\r\nDiabase.—By referring to the classification it will be seen that diabase\r\noccupies the same position among the dike rocks as norite among the\r\nstratified rocks. Like norite it consists usually of the more basic\r\nvarieties of plagioclase with or without augite, diallage, or\r\nhypersthene. Augite, or one of its representatives, is usually present,\r\nand is often the principal constituent. Specimen 1 shows a somewhat\r\nequal development of the feldspar and augite. The name _gabbro_ is\r\nsometimes applied to the coarser and more feldspathic diabases, and\r\nespecially to those containing diallage or hypersthene in the place of\r\ncommon augite. In the opinion of some high authorities, however, it is\r\nunnecessary to recognize two species here; and it makes the\r\nclassification more simple and symmetrical not to do it. The principal\r\naccessories in diabase are biotite, chlorite, magnetite, pyrite,\r\ncalcite, and olivine. Chlorite is often an important constituent, giving\r\nthe rock a greenish aspect; but here, as well as in diorite, the\r\nchlorite is due chiefly or entirely to the alteration of the augite and\r\nfeldspar; and the chloritic varieties of diorite and diabase together\r\nmake up the old species “greenstone.” Similarly, the more compact and\r\ndarker varieties of these two rocks, forming regular, wall-like dikes,\r\nare known as “trap.” Specimen 46.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of their more basic composition, diabase and diorite are\r\nusually strongly contrasted with granite and syenite in color and\r\nspecific gravity, being darker and heavier. The basic rocks, too, decay\r\nmuch more readily than the acidic.\r\n\r\n2. VOLCANIC ROCKS.—As regards composition, we shall find nothing new in\r\nthe volcanic series; for the rocks of this group present essentially the\r\nsame combination of minerals as the dike rocks. In composition, the dike\r\nand volcanic rocks are identical; but in texture, as already explained,\r\nthere is a vast difference. The volcanic rocks differ so widely in\r\ntexture from both the dike and stratified species, that there is rarely\r\nany difficulty in distinguishing them; and hence they have in every\r\ninstance distinct names.\r\n\r\nVolcanic rocks are rarely found in this part of the world; and specimens\r\nof most of them are difficult to obtain. For this reason they can only\r\nbe noticed briefly here, since it is the plan of this Guide to give\r\nespecial attention only to those portions of the subject which can be\r\nillustrated by material within easy reach of teachers.\r\n\r\nRhyolite.—This rock corresponds in composition with granite and gneiss,\r\nbut is less frequently micaceous. The orthoclase in rhyolite, and\r\ngenerally in volcanic rocks, is the clear, pellucid variety—_sanidine_.\r\nIt is more difficult to separate from quartz than ordinary orthoclase,\r\nthe chief distinguishing feature being its cleavage. Plagioclase and\r\nhornblende are common, but not abundant, constituents. The mica, when\r\npresent, is usually biotite. The texture of rhyolite is often more or\r\nless distinctly porphyritic, having a finely crystalline or granular\r\nmatrix, with interspersed crystals of sanidine and quartz. The rock has\r\nusually a rough, harsh feel; and while the coarser varieties have the\r\naspect of granite, the finer approach petrosilex; but all are somewhat\r\nporous, which is seen in the lower specific gravity of rhyolite as\r\ncompared with granite and gneiss.\r\n\r\nTrachyte.—In texture and general aspect rhyolite and trachyte are nearly\r\nidentical. Trachyte, however, is darker, contains little or no quartz,\r\nand more hornblende and plagioclase. In fact, it agrees in composition\r\nwith syenite. This is one of the most important of the volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nObsidian.—Obsidian is sharply distinguished from all other rocks by its\r\nperfect vitreous texture; it is a true volcanic glass. Its surface\r\n(specimen 47) is smooth and glassy, and its fracture eminently\r\nconchoidal. To the naked eye, and usually under the microscope, the\r\ntypical variety is perfectly homogeneous; chemical analysis, however,\r\nshows that it has the composition, commonly of rhyolite, but sometimes\r\nof trachyte. Obsidian is, in fact, simply rhyolite or trachyte which,\r\ncooling quickly, has not had time to crystallize, but has remained\r\npermanently in the amorphous or glassy state. The composition is\r\nsometimes partially revealed where a portion of the sanidine comes out\r\nin distinct crystals porphyritically interspersed through the glass. The\r\nhomogeneity of the texture is sometimes disturbed: by numerous minute\r\nconcentric cracks, forming what is known as perlitic structure and the\r\nvariety perlite; by numerous small spherical concretions, forming the\r\nspherulitic structure and the variety spherulite; and also by the\r\nbanding, which is the result of flowing while in a plastic state,\r\nwhereby portions of the glass of slightly different colors are drawn out\r\ninto layers and interlaminated. The bands are rarely continuous for any\r\ndistance, being usually merely elongated lenticular streaks. The glassy\r\nstate is generally one of inferior density, and hence we find that\r\nobsidian is lighter than the crystalline rocks of the same composition.\r\nObsidian is a good illustration of a non-essential color, for its\r\ncapacity and jet-black color are due entirely to impurities. In very\r\nthin flakes it is transparent and white. It also forms a white powder\r\nwhen crushed, _i.e._, it has a white streak.\r\n\r\nObsidian is often vesicular, from the expansion of the steam and other\r\ngases which it contained when liquid. The most thoroughly vesicular\r\nvarieties are known as _pumice_ (specimen 48). The vesicular texture, by\r\nrendering the rock impervious to light, conceals the impurities, and\r\nthus we get a snow-white pumice from black obsidian. The vesicles are\r\nfrequently elongated, sometimes in a definite direction, though often\r\nforming an irregular net-work of glassy fibres. Pumice is often light\r\nenough to float on water, and it is transported thousands of miles by\r\nthe oceanic currents. It is employed in the arts, and good specimens can\r\nbe obtained at almost any drug-store.\r\n\r\nPetrosilex and Felsite.—Sharply defined groups are unknown in lithology,\r\nbut all is gradation; and between rhyolite and trachyte, which are\r\nalways more or less distinctly crystalline, and obsidian, which is a\r\ntrue glass and perfectly amorphous, there is no break. It is impossible\r\nto draw a sharp line and say, Here the vitreous texture ends and the\r\ncrystalline begins; for the transition is not abrupt, but gradual. We\r\nrecognize, really, in these feldspathic rocks, an intermediate state,\r\nwhich is neither crystalline nor colloid, but both; and this\r\nlithologists have designated the _felsitic_ texture. Felsitic matter\r\ncannot, even with the highest powers of the microscope, be resolved into\r\nseparate grains or particles; and it does not exhibit, except perhaps\r\nvery indistinctly, the phenomenon of double refraction. In other words,\r\nit is not truly crystalline or stony, and yet it is just as clearly not\r\namorphous or glassy.\r\n\r\nFeldspathic rocks exhibiting the felsitic texture in whole or in part\r\nare known as _felsites_. Many high authorities hold that true felsites\r\nare found only among the eruptive rocks; while others claim that they\r\nare in part, or wholly, of sedimentary origin. The writer accepts the\r\nformer view. The felsites are in part acid lavas which have cooled too\r\nslowly to form a true glass, like obsidian, and yet too quickly to\r\nbecome truly crystalline, like rhyolite and trachyte. But they are also\r\nin large part simply devitrified obsidian. Glass is an unstable form of\r\nmineral matter; and every species of glass, including obsidian, tends\r\nwith the lapse of time to become crystalline or stony, the amorphous\r\nchanging to the felsitic structure. Thus, in many cases or usually, what\r\nwe now call felsites were originally true glassy obsidian. Being\r\nperfectly intimate mixtures of the component minerals, the composition\r\nof felsites can usually be determined with certainty only by means of\r\nchemical analysis. By this means chiefly, it has been proved that there\r\nare felsites agreeing in composition with both rhyolite and trachyte.\r\nThere is this general difference in composition, however, between these\r\ncrystalline rocks and the felsites; viz.: mica, hornblende, and augite\r\nare generally wanting in the latter. From this it follows that the\r\nfelsites are, with unimportant exceptions, composed either of quartz and\r\nfeldspar or of feldspar alone.\r\n\r\nThe physical differences between the felsites of unlike composition are\r\nnot great; but they are sufficient to warrant the division of the\r\nfelsites into two species: a basic species, to which the term _felsites_\r\nmay properly be restricted; and an acidic species, for which\r\n_petrosilex_ is a very appropriate name. According to this arrangement,\r\nfelsite is composed chiefly of orthoclase, and, as the table shows,\r\nagrees in composition with trachyte; while petrosilex consists mainly of\r\northoclase and quartz, agreeing in composition with rhyolite. We find\r\nhere nothing new in composition; but petrosilex and felsite are simply\r\nthe crystalline rocks which we have already studied, repeated under a\r\ndifferent texture.\r\n\r\nThe typical felsite or petrosilex is composed entirely of felsitic\r\nmatter, and is perfectly homogeneous, like flint or jasper, which it\r\nclosely resembles in hardness and other physical characteristics. As a\r\nrule, however, the rock is not entirely homogeneous, but there is a\r\nmanifest tendency in the component minerals, and especially in the\r\nfeldspar, to separate out, usually in the form of crystals. In the\r\nbanded variety (specimen 42) the rock is built up of thin layers, which\r\nare often alternately quartzose and feldspathic. There is not a perfect\r\nseparation of the minerals; but that the quartz is chiefly in the dark\r\nlayers, and the feldspar in the light, is shown by the way in which the\r\nlayers are affected by the weather.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common varieties is where a portion, frequently a large\r\nportion, of the feldspar comes out in the form of distinct, separate\r\ncrystals, producing a porphyritic texture. Specimens 5, 6, and 7 are\r\nexamples of porphyritic felsite; and after examining these we can no\r\nlonger doubt that feldspar is an important constituent of the rock.\r\nPetrosilex and felsite are more generally porphyritic than any other\r\nrocks; and they are commonly called porphyry. It is better, however,\r\nsince almost any rock may be porphyritic, and since this texture cannot\r\nbe correlated with any particular composition, not to use porphyry as a\r\nrock-name, but simply as the name of a very important rock-texture. The\r\nbanded and porphyritic textures are about equally characteristic of\r\npetrosilex and felsite. In petrosilex, quartz, as well as feldspar, is\r\nsometimes porphyritically developed, forming the variety known as\r\nquartz-porphyry. There is no limit to the proportion of the quartz and\r\nfeldspar which may crystallize out in this way, and thus we find a\r\nperfectly gradual passage from normal petrosilex or felsite to\r\nthoroughly crystalline granite and syenite.\r\n\r\nAndesite.—This rock has nearly the texture of rhyolite and trachyte, but\r\nis darker and heavier, and corresponds in composition to diorite,\r\nconsisting of plagioclase and hornblende, with usually more or less\r\nsanidine, quartz, augite, biotite, and magnetite.\r\n\r\nBasalt.—The rock bearing this familiar name represents diabase among the\r\ndike rocks. It is the most basic of the volcanic rocks, and consists of\r\nthe more basic varieties of plagioclase, especially labradorite, with\r\naugite, magnetite, and titanic iron. Olivine is a very common and\r\ncharacteristic constituent, and the plagioclase is often replaced in\r\npart by leucite and nephelite. The basalts are usually black, and of\r\nhigh specific gravity; and vary in texture from compact to coarsely\r\ncrystalline. The contraction due to cooling frequently results in the\r\ndevelopment of a columnar structure of remarkable regularity, the\r\ncolumns being normally hexagonal and standing perpendicularly to the\r\ncooling surfaces of the mass. This structure occurs in other eruptive\r\nrocks, but is most characteristic of basalt.\r\n\r\nTachylite.—Tachylite is a highly basic volcanic glass, standing in the\r\nsame relation to basalt and andesite that obsidian does to trachyte and\r\nrhyolite. It is much heavier than obsidian, and is perfectly black and\r\nopaque, except in the finest fibres. It is a comparatively rare rock,\r\nfor the reason that basalt and andesite crystallize more readily than\r\nthe acidic rocks on passing from the liquid to the solid state. On the\r\nsurface of the basic lava, however, where it is in contact with the air,\r\nand congeals almost instantly, a film of glass is formed; but this may\r\nnot be more than a small fraction of an inch in thickness. Like\r\nobsidian, tachylite is often vesicular; but the vesicular basic rocks,\r\nas well as the solid, are usually stony. They occur in vast abundance in\r\nmany volcanic regions, and may be considered the typical lava (specimen\r\n49).\r\n\r\nIn the more ancient lavas, the vesicles are frequently filled by various\r\nminerals—chlorite, epidote, quartz, calcite, etc.—deposited by\r\ninfiltrating waters, and derived in most cases from the decomposition of\r\nthe original constituents of the rock. Thus the vesicular is changed to\r\nthe amygdaloidal texture, and the lava becomes an amygdaloid (specimen\r\n50). The amygdaloidal texture is common in the basic lavas and rare in\r\npumice, simply because the former are more readily decomposed and\r\ncontain a greater variety of bases from which secondary minerals can be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nPorphyrite and Melaphyr.—These two rocks hold essentially the same\r\nrelation as regards origin and structure to the basic lavas that\r\npetrosilex and felsite do to the acidic lavas. Porphyrite agrees in\r\ncomposition with andesite, and melaphyr with basalt. They are usually\r\ndark-colored rocks having a compact or felsitic texture. Porphyrite is,\r\nas the name implies, very commonly porphyritic; while melaphyr is often\r\nvesicular or brecciated, exhibiting all the structural features of\r\ntachylite and basalt, and being in its older forms very generally\r\namygdaloidal.\r\n\r\nVolcanic Tuff and Agglomerate.—Besides the crystalline, glassy, and\r\nfelsitic lavas, already described, and due chiefly to the rate of\r\ncooling of the liquid rock, we may recognize a fourth class to include\r\nthe very abundant lavas which, during explosive eruptions, are ejected\r\nin the solid state, being violently blown out of the crater in the form\r\nof dust and fragments. Falling on the slopes of the volcano or over the\r\nsurrounding country, as in the case of the buried city of Pompeii, the\r\nfragmental lavas remain largely unstratified. But when, as frequently\r\nhappens, they fall into the sea, they are assorted by the waves and\r\ncurrents and arranged in layers after the manner of ordinary sediments,\r\nwith which they are often more or less mixed. Before they become\r\nconsolidated the finer fragmental lava, of whatever composition, is\r\ncalled volcanic dust, and the coarser lapilli or volcanic sand; while\r\nthe consolidated materials are known as tuff and agglomerate\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SUPPLEMENT TO LITHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              VEIN ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll rocks are not embraced in the sedimentary and eruptive divisions,\r\nbut there is a third grand division, which, although rarely mentioned or\r\nrecognized in the more comprehensive works on geology, it is deemed best\r\nnot to leave entirely unnoticed here. These are the _vein_ rocks. They\r\npresent an immense number of varieties, and yet, taken altogether, form\r\nbut a small fraction of the earth’s crust. They are, however, the great\r\nrepositories of the precious and other metals, and hence are objects of\r\nfar greater interest to the miner and practical man than the eruptive\r\nrocks, or, in some parts of the world, even than the sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nThe vein rocks, like the eruptive rocks, occupy fissures in the earth’s\r\ncrust intersecting the stratified formations; but the fissures filled\r\nwith vein rocks are called veins, and not dikes. We will first notice\r\nthe mode of formation of a typical vein, and then examine its contents.\r\nGeologists are agreed that water penetrates to a very great depth in the\r\nearth’s crust. All minerals are more or less soluble in water; and we\r\nmay consider the water circulating through the rocks, especially at\r\nconsiderable depths, as, in most cases, a saturated solution of the\r\nvarious minerals of which they are composed. Very slight changes in the\r\nconditions will cause saturated solutions to deposit part of their\r\nmineral load. The water at great depths has a high temperature, and is\r\nsubjected to an enormous pressure; and both of these circumstances favor\r\nsolution. Suppose, now, that these hot subterranean waters enter a\r\nfissure in the crust and flow upwards, perhaps issuing on the surface as\r\na warm mineral spring; as they approach the surface, the temperature and\r\npressure, and consequently their solvent power, are diminished; and a\r\nportion of the dissolved minerals must be deposited on the walls of the\r\nfissure, which thus becomes narrower, and in the course of time is\r\ngradually filled up. The vein is then complete; and the mineral waters\r\nare forced to seek a new outlet.\r\n\r\nVeins have the same general forms as dikes, since the fissures are\r\nformed in the same way for both; but the vein is of slow growth, and may\r\nrequire ages for its completion, while the dike is formed in an hour or\r\na day. It is now generally believed that water is an important agent in\r\nthe formation of eruptive rocks; since they all contain water at the\r\ntime of their eruption; and since it has been demonstrated that, while\r\nordinary rocks require a temperature of 2000° to 3000° for their fusion\r\nin the absence of water, they are liquified at temperatures below 1000°\r\nin the presence of water. In other words, common rocks are very\r\ninfusible and insoluble bodies, and heat and water acting independently\r\nhave little effect upon them; but when fire and water are combined in\r\nwhat is now known as aqueo-igneous fusion, they prove very efficient\r\nagents of liquefaction.\r\n\r\nIf we adopt these views, then it can be shown that, in origin, veins and\r\ndikes differ in degree only, and are not fundamentally unlike; and the\r\nformation and relations of the three great classes of rocks may be\r\nsummarized as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe ocean and atmosphere, operating on the earth’s surface, have worked\r\nover and stratified the crust, until the sedimentary rocks have now an\r\naverage thickness variously estimated at from ten to thirty or forty\r\nmiles. This entire thickness of stratified rocks, and a considerable\r\ndepth of the underlying unstratified crust, must be saturated with\r\nwater; and all but the more superficial portions of this water-soaked\r\ncrust must be very hot, the temperature increasing steadily downwards\r\nfrom the surface. Both eruptive and vein rocks originate in this highly\r\nheated, hydrated crust. Eruptive rocks are formed when the heat, aided\r\nby more or less water, softens the rocks, either stratified or\r\nunstratified, by aqueo-igneous fusion, and the plastic materials are\r\nforced up through fissures to or toward the surface. Vein rocks are\r\nformed when the water, aided by more or less heat, dissolves the rocks,\r\neither stratified or unstratified, by what may be called igneo-aqueous\r\nsolution, and subsequently deposits the mineral matter in, _i.e._, on\r\nthe walls of, fissures leading up to or toward the surface. In the case\r\nof the dike rocks, heat is the chief agent, and water merely an\r\nauxiliary; while with the vein rocks it is just the reverse. But between\r\nthe two it is probably impossible to draw any sharp line.\r\n\r\nThe water circulating through the crust, and saturated with its various\r\nmineral constituents, has been called the “juice” of the crust; and\r\nveins are formed by the concentration of this earth-juice in fissures.\r\nOne of the most important characteristics of the vein rocks, as a class,\r\nis the immense variety which they present; for nearly every known\r\nmineral is embraced among their constituents; and these are combined in\r\nall possible ways and proportions, so that the number of combinations is\r\nalmost endless. The solvent power of the subterranean waters varies for\r\ndifferent minerals; and appears often to be greatest for the rarer\r\nspecies. In other words, there is a sort of selective action, whereby\r\nmany minerals which exist in stratified and eruptive rocks, so thinly\r\ndiffused as to entirely escape the most refined observation, are\r\nconcentrated in veins in masses of sensible size; and our lists of known\r\nminerals and chemical elements are undoubtedly much longer than they\r\nwould be if these wonderful storehouses of fine minerals which we call\r\nveins had never been explored. As a rule, the minerals in veins form\r\nlarger and more perfect crystals than we find in either of the other\r\ngreat classes of rocks. This is simply because the conditions are more\r\nfavorable for crystallization in veins than in dikes or sedimentary\r\nstrata. In both dike and stratified rocks, the growing crystals are\r\nsurrounded on all sides by solid or semi-solid matter; and, being thus\r\nhampered, it is simply impossible that they should become either large\r\nor perfect. In the vein, on the other hand, there are usually no such\r\nobstacles to be overcome; but the crystals, starting from the walls of\r\nthe fissure, grow toward its centre, their growing ends projecting into\r\na free space, where they have freedom to develop their normal forms and\r\nto attain a size limited only, in many cases, by the breadth of the\r\nfissure. With, possibly, some rare exceptions, all the large and perfect\r\ncrystals of quartz, feldspar, mica, beryl, apatite, fluorite, and of\r\nminerals generally, which we see in mineralogical cabinets, have\r\noriginated in veins. Those fissures which become the seats of mineral\r\nveins are really Nature’s laboratories for the production of rare and\r\nbeautiful mineral specimens; and hence the vein rocks are the chief\r\nresort of the mineralogist, to whom they are of far greater interest\r\nthan all the eruptive and stratified rocks combined.\r\n\r\nThe leading characteristics, then, of the vein rocks may be summarized\r\nas follows: (1) They contain nearly all known minerals, including many\r\nrare species and elements which are unknown outside of this class of\r\nrocks. (2) These mineral constituents, occurring singly and combined,\r\ngive rise to a number of varieties of rocks so vast as to baffle\r\ndetailed description. (3) They exceed all other rocks in the coarseness\r\nof their crystallization, and in the perfection and beauty of the single\r\ncrystals which they afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PETROLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn lithology we investigate the nature of the materials composing the\r\nearth’s crust—the various minerals and aggregates of minerals, or rocks;\r\nwhile in petrology we consider the forms and modes of arrangement of the\r\nrock-masses,—in other words, the architecture of the earth.\r\n\r\nPetrology is the complement of lithology, and in many respects it is the\r\nmost fascinating division of geology, since in no other direction in\r\nthis science are we brought constantly into such intimate relations with\r\nthe beautiful and sublime in nature. The structures of rocks are the\r\nbasis of nearly all natural scenery; for what we call scenery is usually\r\nmerely the external expression, as developed by the powerful but\r\ndelicate sculpture of the agents of erosion—rain and frost, rivers and\r\nglaciers, etc.—of the geological structure of the country. And to the\r\npractised eye of the geologist, a fine landscape is not simply a\r\npleasantly or grandly diversified _surface_, but it has _depth_; for he\r\nreads in the superficial lineaments the structure of the rocks out of\r\nwhich they are carved.\r\n\r\nBut, while the magnitude of the phenomena adds greatly to the charm of\r\nthe study, it also increases the difficulties and taxes the ingenuity of\r\nthe teacher whose work must be done indoors. According to our ideal\r\nmethod, natural science ought to be taught with natural specimens; and\r\nyet here our main reliance must be upon pictures and diagrams.\r\n\r\nNature, however, has not been wholly unmindful of our needs; for she has\r\nworked often upon a very small as well as a very large scale; many of\r\nthe grandest phenomena being repeated in miniature. Thus we observe\r\nrock-folds or arches miles in breadth and forming mountain masses, and\r\nof all sizes from that down to the minutest wrinkle. So with veins,\r\nfaults, etc. And the wonderful thing is that these small examples, which\r\nmay be brought into the class-room, are usually, except in size, exactly\r\nlike the large. Now the aim of every teacher in this department should\r\nbe to secure a collection of these natural models. It is not an easy\r\nthing to do, except one has plenty of time; for they can rarely be\r\npurchased of dealers, but must usually come as the choicest fruit of\r\nrepeated excursions to the natural ledges and quarries, the seashore and\r\nthe mountains. But for the difficulty of getting the specimens there is\r\nsome compensation, since it may be truly said that for the _collector_\r\nspecimens obtained in this way have an interest, a value, and a power of\r\ninstruction beyond what they would otherwise possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Classification of Structures._\r\n\r\nThe structures of rock divide, at the outset, into two classes:—(1) the\r\n_original structures_, or those produced at the same time and by the\r\nsame forces as the rocks themselves, and which are, therefore, peculiar\r\nto the class of rocks in which they occur (_e.g._ stratification,\r\nripple-marks, fossils, etc.); and (2) the _subsequent structures_, or\r\nthose developed in rocks subsequently to their formation, and by forces\r\nthat act more or less uniformly upon all classes of rocks, and which\r\nare, therefore, in a large degree, common to all kinds of rocks (_e.g._\r\nfolds, faults, joints, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe original structures are conveniently and naturally classified in\r\naccordance with the three great classes of rocks: (1) stratified rocks,\r\n(2) eruptive rocks, and (3) vein rocks; while the subsequent structures,\r\nnot being peculiar to particular classes of rocks, are properly divided\r\ninto those produced by (1) the subterranean or igneous agencies, and (2)\r\nthe superficial or aqueous agencies.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1.—Section through sediment deposited by\r\n        rain in a roadside pool: _a._ surface of roadway; _b._\r\n        layer of small pebbles and coarse sand; _c._ fine sand\r\n        passing into _d_; _d._ the finest sand and mud.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                Original Structures of Stratified Rocks.\r\n\r\nSTRATIFICATION.—All rocks formed by strewing materials in water, and\r\ntheir deposition in successive, parallel, horizontal layers, are\r\n_stratified_; and this structure is their _stratification_. It is the\r\nmost important of all rock structures; and there is no kind of structure\r\nthe origin of which is more fully or certainly known. The deposition of\r\nsediment in carefully assorted horizontal layers is readily brought\r\nwithin the comprehension of children by simple experiments with sand and\r\nclay in water; and still better by the examination of the deposits\r\nformed in roadside pools during heavy rains (Fig. 1), and by digging\r\ninto beaches and sandbars, which every child will recognize as formed of\r\nmaterials arranged by water. Great stress should be laid upon the fact\r\nthat a lake like Erie or Champlain is simply a large pool with several\r\nmore or less turbid streams flowing into it, while the single stream\r\nflowing out is clear, the sediment having evidently been deposited in\r\nthe lake; and that every lake is, like the roadside pool, being\r\ngradually filled up with sedimentary or stratified rocks. But the ocean\r\nis a still larger pool, receiving mud and sand from many streams; and\r\nsince we know that nothing escapes from the ocean but invisible vapor,\r\nit is plain that the mud and sand and all other kinds of sediment\r\ncarried into the ocean must be deposited on its floor, and chiefly, as\r\nwe have seen, on that part nearest the land. The consolidation of\r\nbeaches, bars, and mud-flats is all that is necessary to convert them\r\ninto stratified formations of conglomerate sandstone and slate.\r\n\r\nLet us notice now, more particularly, the causes of visible\r\nstratification. As we can easily prove by an experiment with clay in a\r\nbottle of water, if the same kind of material is deposited continuously\r\nthere will be no visible stratification in the deposit. It will be as\r\ntruly stratified as any formation, but not visibly so; because there is\r\nnothing in the nature of the material or the way in which it is laid\r\ndown to bring out distinct lines of stratification. Continuous and\r\nuniform deposition obtains very frequently in nature, but rarely\r\ncontinues long enough to permit the formation of thick beds or strata.\r\nHence, while the stratification is almost always visible on the large\r\nsurfaces of sandstone, slate, etc., exposed in quarries and railway\r\ncuttings, and may usually be seen in the quarried blocks, it is often\r\nnot apparent in hand specimens, which may represent a single homogeneous\r\nlayer. There is one important exception, and that is where the\r\nparticles, although of the same kind, are flat or elongated. Pebbles of\r\nthese forms are common on many beaches; and since they are necessarily\r\narranged horizontally by the action of the water, they will, by their\r\nparallelism, make the stratification of the pudding-stone visible. The\r\nsame result is accomplished still more distinctly by the mica scales,\r\netc., in sandstone and slates, the leaves and flattened stems of\r\nvegetation in bituminous coal, and the flat shells in limestone.\r\n\r\nIn all other cases, visible stratification implies some change in the\r\nconditions; either the deposition was interrupted, or different kinds of\r\nmaterial were deposited at different times. The first cause produces\r\nplanes of easy splitting, or fissility, especially in fine-grained\r\nrocks, like shale. This shaly structure or lamination-cleavage may be\r\ndue, in some cases, to pressure, but it is commonly understood to mean\r\nthat each thin layer of clay became partially consolidated before the\r\nnext one was deposited upon it, so that the two could not perfectly\r\ncohere. Parallel planes of easy splitting are, however, by themselves,\r\nof little value as indications of stratification, since the\r\nlamination-cleavage is not easily distinguished from slaty-cleavage\r\n(roofing slate) and parallel jointing, structures developed subsequently\r\nto the deposition of sediments and quite independent of the\r\nstratification. The second cause, or variations in the kind of sediment,\r\ngives alternating layers differing in color, texture, or composition, as\r\nis seen frequently in sandstone, slate, gneiss, etc.; and of all the\r\nindications of stratification these are the most important and reliable.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2.—Section showing strata and laminæ:\r\n        _a._ conglomerate; _b._ sandstone; _c._ shale; _d._\r\n        limestone.]\r\n\r\nA layer composed throughout of essentially the same kind of rock, as\r\nconglomerate or sandstone, and showing no marked planes of division, is\r\nusually regarded as one _bed_ or _stratum_, although it may vary\r\nconsiderably in texture or color; while the thinner portions composing\r\nthe stratum and differing slightly in color, texture, and composition,\r\nand the thin sheets into which shaly rocks split, are the _laminæ_ or\r\n_leaves_. In Fig. 2 the strata are designated by letters, and the fine\r\nlines and rows of dots show the constituent laminæ, while the whole\r\nsection may be regarded as a small part of a great geological formation.\r\nThe geological record is written chiefly in the sedimentary rocks; and\r\nthe formations, strata, and laminæ may be regarded as the volumes,\r\nchapters, and pages in the history of the earth. Now every feature of a\r\nrock, lithological or petrological, finds its highest interest in the\r\nlight which it throws upon the history of the rock, _i.e._, upon the\r\nconditions of its formation. Observe what the section in Fig. 2 teaches\r\nconcerning the geological history of that locality; premising that any\r\nchapter of geological history written in the stratified rocks should be\r\nread from the bottom upwards, since the lowest strata must have been\r\nformed first and the highest last. The lowest stratum exposed is\r\nconglomerate, indicating a shingle beach swept by strong currents which\r\ncarried away the finer material. Upwards, the conglomerate becomes finer\r\nand shades off into sandstone, and finally into shale, showing that the\r\nwater has become gradually deeper and more tranquil, the shore having,\r\nin consequence of the subsidence, advanced toward the land. The next two\r\nstrata show that this movement is probably reversed; at any rate, the\r\ncurrents become stronger again, and the shale passes gradually into\r\nsandstone and conglomerate. The beach condition prevails now for a long\r\ntime, and thick beds of sand and gravel are formed. The sea then deepens\r\nagain, and we observe a third passage from coarse to fine sediment. This\r\nlocality is now remote from the shore, the gentle currents bringing only\r\nthe finest mud, which slowly builds up the thick bed of shale, in the\r\nupper part of which shells are abundant, indicating that the deposition\r\nof mechanical sediment has almost ceased, and that the shale is changing\r\nto limestone. The purity of the limestone, and the crinoids and other\r\nmarine organisms which it contains, prove that this has now become the\r\ndeep, clear sea; and this condition is maintained for a long period, for\r\nthe limestone is very thick, and this rock is formed with extreme\r\nslowness.\r\n\r\nThe most important point to be gained here is that every line of\r\nstratification and every change in the character of the sediments is due\r\nto some change of corresponding magnitude in the conditions under which\r\nthe rock was formed. The slight and local changes in the conditions\r\noccur frequently and mark off the individual laminæ and strata, while\r\nthe more important and wide-spread changes determine the boundaries of\r\nthe groups of strata and the formations.\r\n\r\nStrata are subject to constant lateral changes in texture and\r\ncomposition, _i.e._, a bed or formation rarely holds the same\r\nlithological characteristics over an extended area. There are some\r\nstriking exceptions, especially among the finer-grained rocks, like\r\nslate, limestone, and coal, which have been deposited under uniform\r\nconditions over wide areas. It is the general rule, however,\r\nparticularly with the coarse-grained rocks, which have been deposited in\r\nshallow water near the land, that the same continuous stratum undergoes\r\ngreat changes in thickness and lithological character when followed\r\nhorizontally. A stratum of conglomerate becomes finer grained and\r\ngradually changes into sandstone, which shades off imperceptibly into\r\nslate, and slate into limestone, etc. Where the stratum is conglomerate,\r\nits thickness will usually be much greater and more variable than where\r\nit is composed of the finer sediments. The rapidity of these changes in\r\ncertain cases is well shown by the parallel sections in Fig. 3. These\r\nrepresent precisely the same beds, as the connecting lines indicate, at\r\npoints only twenty feet apart.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3.—Parallel sections showing rapid\r\n        lateral changes in strata: _c._ clay; _s._ sand; _ss._\r\n        sandstone; _l._ lignite; _f._ fireclay.]\r\n\r\nWhen we glance at the conditions under which stratified rocks are now\r\nbeing formed, it is plain that all strata must terminate at the margin\r\nof the sea in which they were deposited, and in the marginal portions of\r\nthat sea, especially, must exhibit frequent and rapid changes in\r\ncomposition, etc. The sediments forming the surface of the sea-bottom at\r\nthe present time may be regarded as belonging to one continuous stratum;\r\nand it is instructive to examine a chart of any part of our coast, such\r\nas Massachusetts Bay, on which the nature of the bottom is indicated for\r\neach sounding, and observe the distribution of the different kinds of\r\nsediment. On an irregular coast like this, especially, the gravel, sand,\r\nand mud of different colors and textures, and the different kinds of\r\nshelly bottom, form a patchwork, the patches being, for the most part,\r\nof limited extent and shading off gradually into each other.\r\n\r\nOn a more regular coast, like that of New Jersey, the sediments are\r\ndistributed with corresponding uniformity, the changes are less frequent\r\nand more gradual, and we have here a better chance to observe the normal\r\narrangement of the sediments along a line from the shore\r\nseawards—gravel, sand, mud, and shells. On the beach we find the shingle\r\nand coarse pebbles, shading off rapidly into fine pebbles and sand. The\r\nzone or belt of sandy bottom may vary in width from a mile or two to\r\ntwenty miles or more, becoming gradually finer and changing into clay or\r\nmud, which covers, usually, a much broader zone, sometimes extending\r\ninto the deeper parts of the sea, but gradually giving way to calcareous\r\nsediments. Hence we may say that the finer the sediment the greater the\r\narea over which it is spread; but, on the other hand, the coarser the\r\nsediment the more rapidly it increases in thickness. In other words, the\r\nhorizontal extent of a formation deposited in any given period of time\r\nis inversely, and the vertical extent or thickness is directly,\r\nproportional to the size of the particles.\r\n\r\nObservations made in deep wells and mines, and where, by upturning and\r\nerosion, the edges of the strata are exposed on the surface, show that\r\nthe vertical order of the different kinds of sedimentary rocks in the\r\nearth’s crust is extremely variable. But when we take a general view of\r\na great formation, it is often apparent that it consists chiefly of\r\ncoarse-grained rocks in the lower part and fine-grained rocks in the\r\nupper part. This is, in general, a necessary consequence of the fact\r\nthat a great thickness of sediments can only be formed on a subsiding\r\nsea-floor. Such a formation must consist chiefly of shore deposits, and\r\nbe deposited near the shore where the sea is shallow. Hence, 10,000 feet\r\nof sediments implies nearly that amount of subsidence. In consequence,\r\nthe shore line and the several zones of sediment advance towards the\r\nland; and sand is deposited where gravel was at first, and as the\r\nsubsidence continues, both clay and limestone are finally deposited over\r\nthe original beach. When the sea-floor rises, the order of the sediments\r\nis reversed; and it will be observed that in consequence of the advance\r\nand retreat of the shore-line, the formations grow edgewise to a\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.—Overlap and unconformability.]\r\n\r\nOVERLAP AND INTERPOSITION OF STRATA.—Another consequence of the constant\r\noscillation of the shoreline is that successive deposits in the same sea\r\nwill often cover different and unequal areas. When, in consequence of\r\nsubsidence, one formation extends beyond and covers the edge of another,\r\nas shown in Fig. 4, we have the phenomenon described as overlap.\r\nInterposition is similar, being the case where a formation (Fig. 5,\r\n_c._) does not, in certain directions, cover so wide an area as the\r\nstrata (_b. d._) above and below it, which are thus sometimes found in\r\ncontact, although normally separated by the entire thickness of the\r\nintermediate and, seemingly, interposed stratum.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 5.—Interposition of strata.]\r\n\r\nUNCONFORMABILITY.—We have already seen that the rocks on the land are\r\nbeing constantly worn away by the agents of erosion; and it is also a\r\nmatter of common observation that the strata thus exposed are often not\r\nhorizontal, but highly inclined, having been greatly disturbed and\r\ncrumpled during their elevation. Now, when such a land-surface subsides\r\nto form the sea-bottom, and new strata are spread horizontally over it,\r\nthey will lie across the upturned and eroded edges of the older rocks,\r\nand fill the hollows worn out of the latter, as shown in Fig. 6; and the\r\nnew formation is then said to rest unconformably upon the older. Two\r\nstrata or formations are unconformable when the older has suffered\r\nerosion (Fig. 6), or both disturbance and erosion (Fig. 4) before the\r\ndeposition of the newer.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6.—Unconformability.]\r\n\r\nWhen strata are conformable, the deposition may be presumed to have been\r\nnearly or quite continuous; but unconformability clearly proves a\r\nprolonged interruption of the deposition during which the elevation,\r\nerosion, and subsidence of the sea-bottom took place. The section in\r\nFig. 7 shows a second unconformability, proving that the sea-bottom has\r\nhere been lifted three times to form dry land. An unconformability may\r\nsometimes be clearly established when the actual contact of the two\r\nformations cannot be seen, as where the new formation is a conglomerate\r\ncontaining fragments of the older.\r\n\r\nIRREGULARITIES OF STRATIFICATION.—These are especially noticeable in\r\nsandstone and conglomerate, which have been deposited chiefly by strong,\r\nlocal, and variable currents; the kind and quantity of sediment, of\r\ncourse, varying with the strength and direction of the current. Two\r\nkinds of irregularity only may be specially noticed here: (1)\r\ncontemporaneous erosion and deposit, where, in consequence of a change\r\nin the currents, fine material recently deposited is partially swept\r\naway and its place taken by coarser sediments; and (2) oblique\r\nlamination, or current-bedding, where the strata are horizontal as\r\nusual, but the component laminæ are inclined at various angles. This\r\nstructure is characteristic of sediments swept along by strong currents,\r\nespecially when deposited in shallow basins or depressions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7.—Double Unconformability: _q._\r\n        quartzite; _s._ sandstone; _d._ drift.]\r\n\r\nRIPPLE-MARKS.—All who have been on a beach or sand-bar must have noticed\r\nthe lines of wavy ridges and hollows, or ripples, on the surface of the\r\nsand. These are sand-waves, produced by water moving over the sand, or\r\nby air moving over dry sand, as ordinary waves are formed by air moving\r\nover water. Each tide usually effaces the ripple-marks made by its\r\npredecessor and leaves a new series, to be obliterated by the next tide.\r\nBut where sediment is constantly accumulating, a rippled surface may be\r\ngently overspread by a new layer, and thus preserved. Other series of\r\nripples may, in like manner, be formed and preserved in overlying\r\nlayers; and when the beach becomes a firm sandstone, a section of it\r\nwill show the rippled surfaces almost as distinctly as when they were\r\nfirst formed (Fig. 8). Ripple-marks are most perfect in fine sand. They\r\nare not formed in gravel, because it is too coarse; nor in clay, because\r\nit is too tenacious. They are usually limited to shallow water; and are\r\nalways regarded as proving that the rocks in which they occur are\r\nshallow-water or beach deposits. They are normally at right angles to\r\nthe current that produces them, and where this changes with the\r\ndirection of the wind, cross-ripples and other irregularities are\r\nintroduced. Ripple-marks are also usually parallel with the beach, and\r\nwhen they are found in the rocks they give us the direction, as well as\r\nthe position, of the ancient shore-line.\r\n\r\nAgain, the friction of the water pushes the sand-grains along, rolling\r\nthem up on one side of the ripple and letting them fall down on the\r\nother. Hence ripples, formed by a current are always moving and are\r\nunsymmetrical on the cross-section, presenting a long, gentle slope\r\ntoward the current, and a short, steep slope away from it, the arrow in\r\nthe figure indicating the direction of the current, or of the sea in the\r\ncase of a beach. And we may thus learn from the fossil ripples, in some\r\ncases, not only the position and direction of the ancient shore, but\r\nalso on which side the land lay, and on which side the sea. When the\r\nwater is in a state of oscillation, without any distinct current, more\r\nsymmetrical ripples are produced.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8.—Ripple-marks in sandstone.]\r\n\r\nRILL-MARKS, RAIN-PRINTS, AND SUN-CRACKS.—“One of the most fascinating\r\nparts of the work of a field-geologist consists in tracing the shores of\r\nformer seas and lakes, and thus reconstructing the geography of\r\nsuccessive geological periods.” His conclusions, as we have already\r\nseen, are based largely upon the nature of the sediments; but still more\r\nconvincing is the evidence afforded by those superficial features of the\r\nstrata, which, like ripple-marks, seem, by themselves, quite\r\ninsignificant. And among these he lays special emphasis upon those which\r\nshow that during their deposition strata have at intervals been laid\r\nbare to sun and air.\r\n\r\nDuring ebb tide water which has been left at the upper edge of the beach\r\nruns down across the beach in small rills, which excavate miniature\r\nchannels; and when these are preserved in the hard rocks, they prove\r\nthat the latter are beach deposits, and, like the ripple-marks, show the\r\ndirection of the old shore.\r\n\r\nIf a heavy shower of rain falls on a muddy beach or flat, the sediment\r\ndeposited by the returning tide may cover, without obliterating, the\r\nsmall but characteristic impressions of the individual drops; and these\r\nmarkings are frequently found well preserved in the hardest slates and\r\nsandstones, testifying unequivocally to the conditions under which the\r\nrocks were formed. In some cases the rain-prints are found to be ridged\r\nup on one side only, in such a manner as to indicate that the drops as\r\nthey fell were driven aslant by the wind. The prominent side of the\r\nmarking, therefore, indicates the side towards which the wind blew.\r\n\r\nMuddy sediments, especially in lakes and rivers, are often exposed to\r\nthe air and sun during periods of drouth, and as they gradually dry up,\r\npolygonal cracks are formed. The sediment of the next layer will fill\r\nthese sun-cracks; and when, as often happens, it is slightly different\r\nfrom the dessicated layer, they may still be traced. Sun-cracks\r\npreserved in this way are very characteristic of argillaceous rocks,\r\nand, of course, prove that in early times, as at the present day,\r\nsediments of this class were exposed by the temporary retreat of the\r\nwater. The foot-prints or trails of land-animals are often, as in the\r\nsandstones and shales of the Connecticut Valley, associated with, and of\r\ncourse strongly corroborate, all these other evidences of shore\r\ndeposits. From the foot-prints preserved in the rocks we pass naturally\r\nto the consideration of the fossil remains of plants and animals found\r\nentombed in the strata.\r\n\r\nFOSSILS.—Although fossils find their highest interest in the light which\r\nthey throw upon the succession of life on the globe, they may also be\r\nproperly regarded as structural features of stratified rocks; and any\r\none who has seen the dead shells, crabs, fishes, etc., on the beach will\r\nreadily understand how fossils get into the rocks. It is not our\r\nprovince here to study the structure of the fossils themselves, for that\r\nwould involve us in a course in paleontology, a task belonging to the\r\nbiologist rather than the geologist; but we will merely observe the\r\nthree principal degrees in the preservation of fossils:—\r\n\r\n1. _Original composition not completely changed._—Extinct elephants have\r\nbeen found frozen in the river-bluffs of Siberia so perfectly preserved\r\nthat dogs and wolves ate their flesh. The bodies of animals are also\r\nfound well preserved in peat-bogs. All coal is simply fossil vegetation\r\nretaining in a large degree the original composition; and the same is\r\ntrue of ferns, etc., preserved as black impressions in the rocks. All\r\nbones and shells consist of mineral matter which makes them hard, and\r\nanimal matter which makes them tough and strong. In very many cases,\r\nespecially in the newer formations, the animal matter is still\r\npartially, and the mineral matter almost wholly, intact.\r\n\r\n2. _Original composition completely changed, but form and structure\r\npreserved._—All kinds of fossils are commonly called petrifactions, but\r\nonly those preserved in this second way are truly petrified, _i.e._,\r\nturned to stone. “Petrified wood is the best illustration, and in a good\r\nspecimen not only the external form of the wood, not only its general\r\nstructure—bark, wood, radiating silver-grain, and concentric rings of\r\ngrowth—are discernible, but even the microscopic cellular structure of\r\nthe wood, and the exquisite sculpturing of the cell-walls, are perfectly\r\npreserved, so that the kind of wood may often be determined by the\r\nmicroscope with the utmost certainty. Yet not one particle of the\r\norganic matter of the wood remains. It has been entirely replaced by\r\nmineral matter; usually by some form of silica. The same is true of the\r\nshells and bones of animals.”—LE CONTE.\r\n\r\n3. _Original composition and structure both obliterated, and form alone\r\npreserved._—This occurs most commonly with shells, although fossil trees\r\nare also often good illustrations. The general result is accomplished in\r\nseveral ways: (_a_) The shell after being buried in the sediment may be\r\nremoved by solution, leaving a _mould_ of its external form, (_b_) This\r\nmould may subsequently be filled by the infiltration of finer sediment,\r\nforming a _cast_ of the exterior of the shell. (_c_) The shell, before\r\nits solution, may have been filled with mud; and if the shell itself is\r\nthen dissolved, we have a cast of its interior in a mould of its\r\nexterior.\r\n\r\nTIME REQUIRED FOR THE FORMATION OF STRATIFIED ROCKS.—Many attempts have\r\nbeen made to determine the time required for the deposition of any given\r\nthickness of stratified rocks. Of course, only roughly approximate\r\nresults can be hoped for in most cases; but these are at least\r\nsufficient to make it certain that geological time is very long. The\r\naverage relative rate of growth of different kinds of sediment is,\r\nhowever, less open to doubt, for we have already seen that coarse\r\nsediments like gravel and sand accumulate much more rapidly than finer\r\nsediments like clay and limestone; and we are sometimes able to compare\r\nthese two classes of rocks on a very large scale.\r\n\r\nThus, during what is known as the Paleozoic era, a sea extended from the\r\nBlue Ridge to the Rocky Mountains. Along the eastern margin of this sea,\r\nwhere the Alleghany Mountains now stand, sediments—chiefly conglomerate\r\nand sandstone, with some slate and less limestone—accumulated to a\r\nthickness of nearly 40,000 feet. Toward the west, away from the old\r\nshore-line, the coarse sediments gradually die out, and the formations\r\nbecome finer and thinner. In western Ohio and Indiana, slate and\r\nlimestone predominate; while in the central part of the ancient sea, in\r\nIllinois and Missouri, the paleozoic sediments are almost wholly\r\nlimestones, and have a thickness of only 4000 to 5000 feet. In other\r\nwords, while one foot of limestone was forming in the Mississippi\r\nValley, eight to ten feet of coarser sediments were deposited in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe best estimates show that coral-reefs rise—_i.e._, limestones are\r\nformed on them—at the rate of about one foot in two hundred years. But\r\ncoral limestones grow much more rapidly than limestones in general.\r\nSandstones sometimes accumulate so rapidly that trees are buried before\r\nthey have time to decay and fall (Fig. 9). Such a buried forest, like a\r\ncoal-bed, represents a land surface, and proves a subsidence of the\r\nland; and in some cases, as indicated by the section, repeated\r\noscillations of the crust may be proved in this way.\r\n\r\nThe mud deposited by the annual overflow of the Nile is forty feet thick\r\nnear the ancient city of Memphis; and the pedestal of the statue of\r\nRameses II., believed to have been erected B.C. 1361, is buried to a\r\ndepth of nine feet, four inches, indicating that 13,500 years have\r\nelapsed since the Nile began to spread its mud over the sands of the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9.—Erect fossil trees.]\r\n\r\nBut the greatest difficulty in estimating the time required for the\r\nformation of any series of strata arises from the fact that we cannot\r\nusually even guess at the length of the periods when the deposition has\r\nbeen partially or wholly interrupted. Now and then, however, we find\r\nevidence that these periods may be very long. A layer of fossil shells\r\nin sandstone or slate proves an interruption of mechanical deposition.\r\nBeds of coal, fossil forests, and other indications of land surfaces are\r\nstill more conclusive. The interposition of strata (Fig. 5) proves a\r\nprolonged interruption of deposition over the area not covered by the\r\ninterposed bed. But the most important of all evidence is that afforded\r\nby unconformability; and the length of the lost interval between the two\r\nformations is measured approximately by the erosion of the older.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Original Structures of Eruptive Rocks.\r\n\r\nThe structures of this class are divisible into those pertaining to the\r\nvolcanic rocks and those pertaining to the fissure or dike rocks. But\r\nsince volcanoes are rare in this part of the world, while dikes are well\r\ndeveloped in many sections of our country, it seems best to give our\r\nattention chiefly to the latter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10.—Typical dikes.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11.—Section of a granite mass.]\r\n\r\nThe term _dike_ is a general name for all masses of eruptive rocks that\r\nhave cooled and solidified in fissures or cavities in the earth’s crust.\r\nBut the name is commonly restricted to the more regular, wall-like\r\nmasses (Fig. 10), those having extremely irregular outlines, like most\r\nmasses of granite (Fig. 11), being known simply as _eruptive masses_.\r\nThe propriety of this distinction is apparent when we consider the\r\norigin of _dike_ as a geological term. It was first used in this sense\r\nin southern Scotland, where almost any kind of a wall or barrier is\r\ncalled a dike. The dikes traverse the different stratified formations\r\nlike gigantic walls, which are often encountered by the coal-miners, and\r\non the surface are frequently left in relief by the erosion of the\r\nsofter enclosing rock, so that in the west of Scotland, especially, they\r\nare actually made use of for enclosures. In other cases the dike has\r\ndecayed faster than the enclosing rock, and its position is marked by a\r\nditch-like depression. The narrow, straight, and perpendicular clefts or\r\nchasms observed on many coasts are usually due to the removal of the\r\nwall-like dikes by the action of the waves. Dikes are sometimes mere\r\nplates of rock, traceable for a few yards only; and they range in size\r\nfrom that up to those a hundred feet or more in width, and traceable for\r\nscores of miles across the country, their outcrops forming prominent\r\nridges. The sides of dikes are often as parallel and straight of those\r\nof built walls, the resemblance to human workmanship being heightened by\r\nthe numerous joints which, intersecting each other along the face of a\r\ndike, remind us of well-fitted masonry.\r\n\r\nFORMS OF DIKES.—A dike is essentially a casting. Melted rock is forced\r\nup from the heated interior into a cavity or crack in the earth’s crust,\r\ncools and solidifies there, and, like a metallic casting, assumes the\r\nform of the fissure or mould. In other words, the form of the dike is\r\nexactly that of the fissure into which the lava was injected. Now the\r\nforms of fissures depend partly upon the nature of the force that\r\nproduces them, but very largely upon the structure—and especially the\r\njoint-structure—of the enclosing rocks. Nearly all rocks are traversed\r\nby planes of division or cracks called joints, which usually run in\r\nseveral directions, dividing the rock into blocks. And it is probable\r\nthat dike-fissures are most commonly produced, not by breaking the rocks\r\nanew, but by widening or opening the pre-existing joint-cracks. Hence\r\nthe straight and regular jointing of slate, limestone and most\r\nsedimentary rocks is accompanied by wall-like dikes—the typical dikes\r\n(Fig. 10); while the more irregular jointing of granite and other\r\nmassive rocks gives rise to sinuous, branching, variable dikes. The\r\ngeneral dependence of dikes upon the joint-structure of the rocks is\r\nproved by the facts that dikes, like joints, are normally vertical or\r\nhighly inclined, and that they are usually parallel with the principal\r\nsystems of joints in the same district. The wall-like dikes also give\r\noff branches, but usually in a regular manner, as shown in Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12.—Dike with regular branches.]\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF DIKES.—The rock traversed by a dike is called the _country_\r\nor _wall_ rock. Fragments of this are often torn off by the igneous\r\nmaterial, and become enclosed in the latter. Such enclosed fragments may\r\nsometimes form the main part of the dike, which then, since they are\r\nnecessarily angular, often assumes the aspect of a breccia. This is the\r\nonly important exception to the rule that dikes are homogeneous in\r\ncomposition; _i.e._, in the same dike we can usually find—from end to\r\nend, from side to side, and probably from top to bottom—no essential\r\ndifference in composition. But there is often a marked contrast in\r\n_texture_ between different parts of a dike, and especially between the\r\nsides and central portion. The liquid rock loses heat most rapidly where\r\nit is in contact with the cold walls of the fissure, and solidifies\r\nbefore it has time to crystallize, remaining compact and sometimes even\r\nglassy; while in the middle of the dike, unless it is very narrow, it\r\ncools so slowly as to develop a distinctly crystalline texture. There is\r\nno abrupt change in texture, but a gradual passage from the compact\r\nborder to the coarsely crystalline or porphyritic middle portion. It is\r\nobvious that a similar gradation in texture must exist between the top\r\nand bottom of a dike.\r\n\r\nCONTACT PHENOMENA.—Under this head are grouped the interesting and\r\nimportant phenomena observable along the contact between the dike and\r\nwall-rock. These throw light upon the conditions of formation of dikes,\r\nand are often depended upon to show whether a rock mass is a dike or\r\nnot. The student will observe here:—\r\n\r\n1. The detailed form of the contact. It may be straight and simple, or\r\nexceedingly irregular, the dike penetrating the wall, and enclosing\r\nfragments of it, as in Fig. 11, which is a typically igneous contact.\r\n\r\n2. The alteration of the wall-rock by heat. This may consist in: (_a_)\r\n_coloration_, shales and sandstones being reddened in the same way as\r\nwhen clay is burnt for bricks; (_b_) _baking and induration_, sandstone\r\nbeing converted into quartzite and even jasper; clay, slate, etc., being\r\nnot only baked to a flinty hardness, but actually vitrified, as in\r\nporcelainite; and bituminous coal being converted into natural coke or\r\nanthracite; and (_c_) _crystallization_, chalk, and other limestones\r\nbeing changed to marble, and crystals of pyrite, calcite, quartz, etc.,\r\nbeing developed in slate, sandstone, and other rocks.\r\n\r\n3. The alteration of the dike-rock by (_a_) more rapid cooling, and\r\n(_b_) the access of thermal waters.\r\n\r\nThe alteration of the wall-rock may extend only a few inches or many\r\nyards from the dike, gradually diminishing with the distance; and the\r\ncases are surprisingly numerous where there is no perceptible\r\nalteration; and, again, the alteration is usually mutual, the dike-rock\r\nbeing altered in texture, color, and composition.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13.—Ideal cross-section of a laccolite.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14.—Ideal cross-section of a volcano.]\r\n\r\nINTRUSIVE BEDS.—We commonly think of dikes as cutting across the strata,\r\nbut they often lie in planes parallel with them; and the same dike may\r\nrun across the beds in some parts of its course and between them in\r\nothers (Fig. 12), or the conformable dike maybe simply a lateral branch\r\nof a main vertical dike, as shown in the same figure. All dikes or\r\nportions of dikes lying conformably between the strata are called\r\n_intrusive beds_ or _sheets_.\r\n\r\nWhen a dike fails to reach the surface, but spreads out horizontally\r\nbetween the strata, forming a thick dome or oven-shaped intrusive bed,\r\nthe latter is called a _laccolite_ (Fig. 13). Laccolites are sometimes\r\nof immense volume, containing several cubic miles of rock. Fig. 14\r\nenables us to compare the laccolite with the volcano.\r\n\r\nIn the one case a large mound of eruptive material accumulates between\r\nthe strata, the overlying beds being lifted into a dome; while in the\r\nother case the fissure or vent reaches the surface, and the mound of\r\nlava is built up on top of the ground.\r\n\r\nCOTEMPORANEOUS BEDS.—When the lava emitted by a crater is sufficiently\r\nliquid, it spreads out horizontally, forming a volcanic sheet or bed. If\r\nsuch an eruption is submarine, or the lava flow is subsequently covered\r\nby the sea, sedimentary deposits are formed over it; and beds of lava\r\nwhich thus come to lie conformably between sedimentary strata are known\r\nas _cotemporaneous sheets_ or _beds_, because they belong, in order of\r\ntime, in the position in which we find them, being, like any member of a\r\nstratified series, newer than the underlying and older than the\r\noverlying strata. Cotemporaneous lava-flows are sometimes repeated again\r\nand again in the same district, and thus important formations are built\r\nup of alternating igneous and aqueous deposits. Evidently, the student\r\nwho would read correctly the record of igneous activity in the past must\r\nbe able to distinguish intrusive and cotemporaneous beds. The principal\r\npoints to be considered in making this distinction are: (1) The\r\nintrusive bed is essentially a dike, dense and more or less crystalline\r\nin texture, altering, and often enclosing fragments of, both the\r\nunderlying and overlying strata, and frequently jogging across or\r\npenetrating the sediments. (2) The cotemporaneous bed, on the other\r\nhand, being essentially a lava-flow, is much less dense and crystalline,\r\nbeing usually distinctly scoriaceous or amygdaloidal, especially at the\r\nborders, and the underlying strata alone showing heat action, or\r\noccurring as enclosures in the lava; for the overlying strata are newer\r\nthan the lava, and often consist largely, at the base, of water-worn\r\nfragments of the lava.\r\n\r\nAGES OF DIKES.—The ages of dikes may be estimated in several ways. They\r\nare necessarily newer than any stratified formation which they intersect\r\nor of which they enclose fragments; but any formation crossing the top\r\nof a dike must usually be regarded as newer than the dike, especially if\r\nit contains water-worn fragments of the dike rock.\r\n\r\nThe relative ages of different dikes are determined by their relations\r\nto the stratified formations; and still more easily by their mutual\r\nintersections, on the principle that when two dikes cross each other,\r\nthe intersecting must be newer than the intersected dike. It is\r\nsometimes possible, in this way, to prove several distinct periods of\r\neruption in the same limited district. The textures of dikes also often\r\nafford reliable indications of their ages; for, as we have already seen,\r\nthe upper part of a dike, cooling rapidly and under little pressure,\r\nmust be less dense and crystalline than the deep-seated portion, which\r\ncools slowly and under great pressure.\r\n\r\nNow, the lower, coarsely crystalline part of a dike can usually be\r\nexposed on the surface only as the result of enormous erosion; and\r\nerosion is a slow process, requiring vast periods of time. Hence, when\r\nwe see a coarse-grained dike outcropping on the surface, we are\r\njustified in regarding it as very old, for all the fine-grained upper\r\npart has been gradually worn away by the action of the rain, frost, etc.\r\nOther things being equal, coarse-grained must be older than fine-grained\r\ndikes; and the texture of a dike is at once a measure of its age and of\r\nthe amount of erosion which the region has suffered since it was formed.\r\n\r\nERUPTIVE MASSES.—In striking contrast with the more or less wall-like\r\ndikes are the highly irregular, and even ragged, outlines of the\r\neruptive masses; and it is worth while to notice the probable cause of\r\nthis contrast. The true dikes are formed, for the most part, of\r\ncomparatively fine-grained rocks—the typical “traps”; while the eruptive\r\nmasses consist chiefly of the coarse-grained or granitic varieties. Now\r\nwe have just seen that the coarse-grained rocks have been formed at\r\ngreat depths in the earth’s crust, while the fine-grained are\r\ncomparatively superficial. But we have good reason for believing that\r\nthe joint-structure, upon which the forms of dikes so largely depend, is\r\nnot well developed at great depths, where the rocks are toughened, if\r\nnot softened, by the high temperature. In other words, trap dikes are\r\nformed in the jointed formations, which break regularly; while the\r\ngranitic masses are formed where the absence of joint-structure and a\r\nhigh temperature combine to cause extremely irregular rifts and cavities\r\nwhen the crust is broken.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC PIPES OR NECKS.—Every volcano and every lava-flow or volcanic\r\nsheet must be connected with the earth’s interior by a channel or\r\nfissure, which becomes a dike when the lava ceases to flow. But the\r\nconverse proposition is not true, for it is probable that many dikes did\r\nnot originally reach the surface, but have been exposed by subsequent\r\ndenudation. This is conspicuously the case with laccolites and other\r\nforms of intrusive sheets. Volcanic sheets or beds have probably often\r\nresulted from the overflow of the lava at all points of an extensive\r\nfissure or system of fissures; but the vent of the true volcano must be\r\nmore circumscribed, an approximately circular opening in the earth’s\r\ncrust, although doubtless originating in a fissure or at the\r\nintersection of two or more fissures, the lava continuing to flow at the\r\nwidest part of the wound in the crust long after it has congealed in the\r\nnarrower parts. Such a tube is known as the neck or pipe of the volcano;\r\nand volcanic necks are a highly interesting class of dikes, since they\r\ndetermine the exact location of many an ancient volcano, where the\r\nvolcanic pile itself has long since been swept away. Necks and dikes are\r\nthe downward prolongations or roots of the volcanic cone or sheet, and\r\ncannot be exposed on the surface until the volcanic fires have gone out\r\nand the agents of erosion have removed the greater part of the ejected\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nHence, equally with the dikes which originally failed to reach the\r\nsurface, they, wherever open to our observation, testify to extensive\r\nerosion and a vast antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Original Structures of Vein Rocks.\r\n\r\nMany things called veins are improperly so called, such as dikes of\r\ngranite and trap, and beds of coal and iron-ore. The smaller, more\r\nirregular, branching dikes, especially, are very commonly called veins,\r\nand to distinguish the true veins from these eruptive masses, they are\r\ndesignated as _mineral veins_ or _lodes_, although the term _lode_ is\r\nusually restricted to the metalliferous veins.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF VEINS.—Various theories of the formation of veins have been\r\nproposed, but the most of these are of historic interest merely, for\r\ngeologists are now well agreed that nearly all true veins have been\r\nformed by the deposition of minerals from solution in fissures or\r\ncavities in the earth’s crust. In many cases, especially where the veins\r\nare of limited extent, it seems probable that a part or all of the\r\nmineral matter was derived from the immediately enclosing rocks, being\r\ndissolved out by percolating water; and these are known as segregation\r\nor lateral secretion veins. But it is quite certain that as a general\r\nrule the mineral solutions have come chiefly from below, the deep-seated\r\nthermal waters welling up through any channel opened to them, and\r\ngradually depositing the dissolved minerals on the walls of the fissure\r\nas the temperature and pressure are diminished. This case, however,\r\ndiffers from the first only in deriving the vein-forming minerals from\r\nmore remote and deeper portions of the enclosing rocks; and thus we see\r\nthat vein-formation, whether on a large or a small scale, is always\r\nessentially a process of segregation.\r\n\r\nWe know that every volcano and every lava flow must be connected below\r\nthe surface with a dike; and it is almost equally certain that the\r\nwaters of mineral springs forming tufaceous mineral deposits on the\r\nsurface, as in the geyser districts, also deposit a portion of the\r\ndissolved minerals on the walls of the subterranean channels, which are\r\nthus being gradually filled up and converted into mineral veins, which\r\nwill be exposed on the surface when erosion has removed the tufaceous\r\noverflow. This connection of vein-formation with the superficial\r\ndeposits of existing springs has been clearly proved in several\r\nimportant instances in Nevada and California.\r\n\r\nVeins occur chiefly in old, metamorphic, and highly disturbed\r\nformations, where there is abundant evidence of the former existence of\r\nprofound fissures, and in regions similar to those in which thermal\r\nsprings occur to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the supplement to the lithological section the student will find the\r\nformation of a typical vein briefly described and contrasted with that\r\nof a typical dike; also a brief account of the lithological\r\npeculiarities of vein rocks, and general statements concerning their\r\nrelative abundance and vast economic importance.\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VEINS.—The typical vein may be described as\r\na fissure of indefinite length and depth, filled with mineral substances\r\ndeposited from solution. Externally, it is very similar to the typical\r\ndike, for the fissures are made in the same way for both. Veins are\r\nnormally highly inclined to the horizon; they exhibit in nearly every\r\nrespect the same general relations to the structure of the country rock\r\nas dikes; and the ages of veins are determined in the same way as the\r\nages of dikes.\r\n\r\nThe extensive mining operations to which veins have been subjected in\r\nall parts of the world, have made our knowledge of their forms below the\r\nsurface very full and accurate. It has been learned in this way that\r\nvery often the corresponding portions of the walls of a vein do not\r\ncoincide in position, but one side is higher or lower than the other,\r\nshowing that the walls slipped over each other when the fissure was\r\nformed or subsequently; and this faulting or displacement of the walls\r\nappears to be much more common with veins than with dikes, perhaps\r\nbecause the fissures remained open much longer. This slipping of the\r\nwalls is the principal cause of the almost constant changes in the width\r\nof veins. For, since the walls are never true planes, and are often\r\nhighly irregular any unequal movements must bring them nearer together\r\nat some points than at others. As a rule, the enormous friction\r\naccompanying the faulting, either crushes the wall-rock, or polishes and\r\nstriates it, producing the highly characteristic surfaces known as\r\n_slicken-sides_. Where the wall is finely pulverized in this way, or is\r\npartially decomposed before or after the filling of the fissure, a thin\r\nlayer of soft, argillaceous material is formed, separating the vein\r\nproper from the wall-rock. The miners call this the _selvage_; and it is\r\na very characteristic feature of the true fissure veins.\r\n\r\nFragments of the wall-rock are frequently enclosed in veins, and the\r\nlatter sometimes branch or divide in such a way as to surround a large\r\nmass of the wall, which is known as a “horse.” A similar result is\r\naccomplished when a fissure is re-opened after being filled, if the new\r\nfissure does not coincide exactly with the old. It has been proved that\r\nveins have thus been re-opened and filled several times in succession;\r\nand in this way fragments of the older vein material become enclosed in\r\nthe newer.\r\n\r\nAlthough usually determined in direction by the joint-structure of the\r\ncountry rock, veins are often parallel with the bedding, especially in\r\nhighly inclined, schistose formations. Such interbedded veins are\r\ncommonly distinctly lenticular in form, occupying rifts in the strata\r\nwhich thin out in all directions and are often very limited in extent.\r\n\r\nWhether conforming with the joint-structure or bedding, veins are\r\ncommonly arranged in systems by their parallelism, those of different\r\nsystems or directions usually differing in age and composition, and the\r\nolder veins being generally faulted or displaced when intersected by the\r\nnewer.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VEINS.—Internally, veins and dikes are\r\nstrongly contrasted; and it is upon the internal features, chiefly, as\r\npreviously explained, that we must depend for their distinction. In\r\nmetalliferous veins the minerals containing the metal sought for (the\r\ngalenite, sphalerite, etc.) are the _ore_; while the non-metalliferous\r\nminerals (the quartz, feldspar, calcite, etc.) are called the _gangue_\r\nor vein-stone proper. Although the combinations of minerals in veins are\r\nalmost endless, yet certain associations of ores with each other and\r\nwith different gangue minerals are tolerably constant, and constitute an\r\nimportant subject for the student of metallurgy and mining.\r\n\r\nWhen a vein is composed of a single mineral, as quartz, it may rival a\r\ndike in its homogeneity. Most important veins, however, are composed of\r\nseveral or a large number of minerals, which may be sometimes more or\r\nless uniformly mixed with each other, but are usually distributed in the\r\nfissure in a very irregular manner. The great granite veins which are\r\nworked for mica, feldspar and quartz, are good illustrations, on a large\r\nscale, of the structure of veins in which several minerals have been\r\ndeposited cotemporaneously. The individual minerals are found to a large\r\nextent, in great, irregular masses, with no order observable in their\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nWhen a mineral is deposited from solution, it crystallizes by preference\r\non a surface of similar composition, thus quartz on quartz, feldspar on\r\nfeldspar, and so on; and it seems probable that this selective action of\r\nthe wall-rock may be a principal cause of the irregular distribution of\r\nminerals in veins. It has often been observed in metalliferous veins\r\nthat the richness varies with the nature of the adjacent country rock.\r\nThis dependence of the contents of a fissure upon the wall-rock may be\r\ndue in part to the selective deposition of the minerals, and in part to\r\ntheir derivation from the contiguous portions of the country or\r\nwall-rock, as in the so-called segregated veins. Temperature and\r\npressure exert an important influence upon chemical precipitation, and\r\nit is, therefore, probable that the composition of many veins varies\r\nwith the depth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15.—Ideal section of a vein.]\r\n\r\nFrequently, perhaps usually, the minerals of composite veins are\r\ndeposited in succession, instead of cotemporaneously, giving rise to the\r\nremarkable banded structure so characteristic of this class of veins.\r\nThe first mineral deposited in the fissure forms a layer covering each\r\nwall, and is in turn covered by layers of the second mineral, and that\r\nby the third, and so on, until the fissure is filled, or the solution\r\nexhausted. The distinguishing features of this structure are shown in\r\nFig. 15, in which _w w_ represents the wall-rock, _a a_, _b b_, _c c_\r\nare successive layers of quartz, fluorite and barite, and the central\r\nband, _d_, is galenite. Since the vein grows from the outside inward,\r\nthe outer layers are the oldest, and the central layers are the newest;\r\nagain, the layers are symmetrically arranged, being repeated in the\r\nreverse order on opposite sides of the middle of the vein; and, lastly,\r\nin layers composed of prismatic crystals, as quartz (see the figure);\r\nthe crystals are perpendicular to the wall and often project into, and\r\neven through, the succeeding layers. Such a crystalline layer is called\r\na “_comb_” and the interlocking of the layers in this way is described\r\nas the _comb-structure_ of the vein. The banding of veins is thus\r\nstrongly contrasted with stratification, and with the structure in dikes\r\ndue to the more rapid cooling along the walls. The duplicate layers are\r\noften discontinuous and of unequal thickness, on account of the strong\r\ntendency to segregation in the materials. This is clearly shown in Fig.\r\n16, drawn on a reduced scale from a polished section of a lead vein in\r\nCumberland, England, contained in the Museum of the Boston Society of\r\nNatural History. In this the gangue minerals are fluorite (_f_) and\r\nbarite (_b_). The central band (_f g_) is a darker fluorite containing\r\nirregular masses of galenite. The banded structure of veins is exactly\r\nreproduced in miniature in the banding of agates, geodes, and the\r\namygdules formed in old lavas. Unfilled cavities frequently remain along\r\nthe middle of the vein. When small, these are known as “pockets.” They\r\nare commonly lined with crystals; and when the latter are minute, the\r\npockets are called druses. In metalliferous veins, the ore is much more\r\nabundant in some parts than in others, and these ore-bodies, especially\r\nwhen somewhat definite in outline, are known in their different forms\r\nand in different localities, as _courses_, _slants_, _shoots_,\r\n_chimneys_, and _bonanzas_ of ore. The intersections and junctions of\r\nveins are often among the richest parts, as if the meeting of dissimilar\r\nsolutions had determined the precipitation of the ore.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16.—Section of a lead vein, one-fifth\r\n        natural size.]\r\n\r\nMetalliferous veins, especially, are usually deeply decomposed along the\r\noutcrop by the action of atmospheric agencies. The ore is oxidized, and\r\nto a large extent removed by solution, leaving the quartz and other\r\ngangue minerals in a porous state, stained by oxides of iron, copper,\r\nand other metals, forming the _gossan_ or _blossom-rock_ of the vein.\r\n\r\nPECULIAR TYPES OF VEINS.—In calcareous or limestone formations,\r\nespecially, the joint-cracks and bedding-cracks are often widened\r\nthrough the solution of the rock by infiltrating water, and thus become\r\nthe channels of a more or less extensive subterranean drainage, by which\r\nthey are more rapidly enlarged to a system of galleries and chambers,\r\nand, in some cases, large limestone caverns. The water dripping into the\r\ncavern from the overlying limestone is highly charged with carbonate of\r\nlime, which is largely deposited on the ceiling and floor of the cavern,\r\nforming stalactitic and stalagmitic deposits. These are masses of\r\nmineral matter deposited from solution in cavities in the earth’s crust,\r\nand are essentially vein-formations. Portions of caverns deserted by the\r\nflowing streams by which they were excavated, are often filled up in\r\nthis way, being converted into irregular veins of calcite. But calcite\r\nis not the only mineral found in these cavern deposits, for barite and\r\nfluorite, and various lead and zinc ores, especially the sulphides of\r\nthese metals—galenite and sphalerite—have also been leached out of the\r\nsurrounding limestone and concentrated in the caverns. The celebrated\r\nlead mines of the Mississippi Valley, and some of the richest\r\nsilver-lead mines of Utah and Nevada are of this character. The forms of\r\nthese cavern-deposits vary almost indefinitely, and are often highly\r\nirregular. The principal types are known as _gash-veins_, _flats_ and\r\n_sheets_ (Fig. 17), _chambers_ and _pockets_.\r\n\r\nWhere joints and other cracks have opened slightly in different\r\ndirections and become filled with infiltrated ores, we have what the\r\nGerman miners call a _stock-work_,—an irregular network of small and\r\ninterlacing veins.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 17.—Gash-veins and sheets.]\r\n\r\nAn _impregnation_ is an irregular segregation of metalliferous minerals\r\nin the mass of some eruptive or crystalline rock. Its outlines are not\r\nsharply defined, but it shades off gradually into the enclosing rock.\r\n\r\n_Fahlbands_ are similar ill-defined deposits or segregations in\r\nstratified rocks. An impregnation or vein occurring along the contact\r\nbetween two dissimilar rocks is called a _contact deposit_. These are\r\nusually found between formations of different geological ages, and\r\nespecially between eruptive and sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Subsequent Structures produced by Subterranean Agencies.\r\n\r\nThe subterranean forces concerned in the formation of rocks are chiefly\r\nvarious manifestations of that enormous tangential pressure developed in\r\nthe earth’s crust, partly by the cooling and shrinkage of its interior,\r\nbut largely, it is probable, by the diminution of the velocity of the\r\nearth’s rotation by tidal friction, and the consequent diminution of the\r\noblateness of its form. It is well known that the centrifugal force\r\narising from the earth’s rotation is sufficient to change the otherwise\r\nspherical form of the earth to an oblate spheroid, with a difference of\r\ntwenty-six miles between the equatorial and polar diameters. It is also\r\nwell known that while the earth turns from west to east on its axis, the\r\ntidal wave moves around the globe from east to west, thus acting like a\r\npowerful friction-brake to stop the earth’s rotation. Our day is\r\nconsequently lengthening, and the earth’s form as gradually approaching\r\nthe perfect sphere. This means a very decided shortening and consequent\r\ncrumpling of the equatorial circumference, and is equivalent to a marked\r\nshrinkage of the earth’s interior, so far as the equatorial regions are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe most important and direct result of the horizontal thrust, whether\r\ndue to cooling or tidal friction, is the corrugation or wrinkling of\r\nthe crust; and the earth-wrinkles are of three orders of\r\nmagnitude,—continents, mountain-ranges, and rock-folds or arches.\r\n\r\nContinents and ocean-basins, although the most important and permanent\r\nstructural features of the earth’s crust, do not demand further\r\nconsideration here, since their forms and relations are adequately\r\ndescribed in the better text-books of physical geography. The forms and\r\ndistribution of mountain-ranges might be dismissed in the same way; but,\r\nunlike continents, the structure of mountains, upon which their reliefs\r\nmainly depend, is quite fully exposed to our observation, and is one of\r\nthe most important fields of the student of structural geology.\r\nMountains, however, as previously explained, combine nearly all the\r\nkinds of structure produced by the subterranean agencies, and their\r\nconsideration, therefore, belongs at the end rather than the beginning\r\nof this section.\r\n\r\nINCLINED OR FOLDED STRATA.—Normally, strata are horizontal, and dikes\r\nand veins are vertical or nearly so. Hence the stratified rocks are more\r\nexposed to the crumpling action of the tangential pressure in the\r\nearth’s crust than the eruptive and vein rocks; and it is for this\r\nreason and partly because the stratified rocks are vastly more abundant\r\nthan the other kinds, that the effects of the corrugation of the crust\r\nare studied chiefly in the former. But it should be understood that\r\nfolded dikes and veins are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThat the stratified rocks have, in many instances, suffered great\r\ndisturbance subsequent to their deposition, is very evident; for, while\r\nthe strata must have been originally approximately straight and\r\nhorizontal, they are now often curved, or sharply bent and contorted,\r\nand highly inclined or even vertical. All inclined beds or strata are\r\nportions of great folds or arches. Thus we may feel sure when we see a\r\nstratum sloping downward into the ground, that its inclination or dip\r\ndoes not continue at the same angle, but that at some moderate depth it\r\ngradually changes and the bed rises to the surface again. Similarly, if\r\nwe look in the opposite direction and think of the bed as sloping\r\nupward—we know that the surface of the ground is being constantly\r\nlowered by erosion, and consequently that the inclined stratum formerly\r\nextended higher than it does now, but not indefinitely higher; for, in\r\nimagination, we see it curving and descending to the level of the\r\npresent surface again. Hence it forms, at the same time, part of one\r\nside of a great concave arch, and of a great convex arch, just as every\r\ninclined surface on the ground indicates both a hill and a valley. And\r\nguided by this principle we can often reconstruct with much probability\r\nfolds that have been more or less completely swept away by erosion, or\r\nthat are buried beyond our sight in the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nThe arches of the strata are rarely distinctly indicated in the\r\ntopography, but must be studied where the ground has been partly\r\ndissected, as in cliffs, gorges, quarries, etc. They are also, as a\r\nrule, far more irregular and complex than they are usually conceived or\r\nrepresented. The wrinkles of our clothing are often better illustrations\r\nof rock-folds than the models and diagrams used for that purpose. This\r\nbecomes self-evident when we reflect that the earth’s crust is\r\nexceedingly heterogeneous in composition and structure, and must,\r\ntherefore, yield unequally to the unequal strains imposed upon it.\r\n\r\nThe folds or undulations of the strata may be profitably compared with\r\nwater-waves. In fact, the comparison is so close that they have been not\r\ninaptly called rock-waves. Folds, like waves, unless very large, rarely\r\ncontinue for any great distance, but die out and are replaced by others,\r\ngiving rise to the _en echelon_ or step-like arrangement. The plan of\r\nboth a wave and a fold is a more or less elongated ellipse, each stratum\r\nin a fold being semi-ellipsoidal or boat-shaped. In other words, a\r\nnormal fold is an elongated mound of concentric strata, being highest at\r\nthe centre, sloping very gradually toward the ends, and much more\r\nabruptly toward the sides.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18.—Anticlinal and synclinal folds.]\r\n\r\nThe imaginary line passing longitudinally through a fold, about which\r\nthe strata appear to be bent, is the _axis_; and the plane lying midway\r\nbetween the two sides of a fold and including the axis is the _axial\r\nplane_. The two principal kinds of folds are the _anticline_ (Fig. 18,\r\n_A_), where the strata dip away from the axis; and the _syncline_ (Fig.\r\n18, _B_), where they dip toward the axis. They are commonly, but not\r\nalways, correlative, like hill and valley.\r\n\r\nRock-folds are of all sizes, from almost microscopic wrinkles to great\r\narches miles in length and breadth, and thousands of feet in height. The\r\nsmaller folds, or such as may be seen in hand specimens and even in\r\nconsiderable blocks of stone, are commonly called contortions, and it is\r\ninteresting to observe that they are, in nearly everything except size,\r\nprecisely like the large folds, so that they answer admirably as\r\ngeological models. Large folds, however, are almost necessarily curves,\r\nbut contortions are frequently angular (Fig. 19). With folds, as with\r\nwaves, the small undulations are borne upon the large ones; but the\r\ncontortions are not uniformly distributed. An inspection of Fig. 18\r\nshows that when the rocks are folded they must be in a state of tension\r\non the anticlines (_A_), and in a state of compression in the synclines\r\n(_B_), and the latter is evidently the normal position of the puckerings\r\nor contortions of the strata, as shown in Fig. 20. Contortions are also\r\nmost commonly found in thin-bedded, flexible rocks, such as shales and\r\nschists. And when we find them in hard, rigid rocks, like gneiss and\r\nlimestone, it must mean either that the structure was developed with\r\nextreme slowness, or that the rock was more flexible then and possibly\r\nplastic.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 19.—Contorted strata.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 20.—Contorted syncline.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 21.—Section of anticlinal mountains.]\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to notice the relations of anticlinal and\r\nsynclinal folds to the agents of erosion. At the time the folds are\r\nmade, the anticlinals, of course, are ridges, and the synclinals,\r\nvalleys, and this relation sometimes continues, as shown in Fig. 21; but\r\nwe have seen that the rocks in the trough of the synclinal are\r\ncompressed and compacted, _i.e._, made more capable of resisting\r\nerosion, while those on the crest of the anticlinal are stretched and\r\nbroken, _i.e._, made more susceptible of erosion. The consequence is\r\nthat the anticlinals are usually worn away very much faster than the\r\nsynclinals; so much faster that in many cases the topographic features\r\nare completely transposed, and in place of anticlinal ridges and\r\nsynclinal valleys (Fig. 21) we find synclinal ridges and anticlinal\r\nvalleys (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 22.—Section of synclinal mountains.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 23.—Monoclinal fold.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 24.—Unsymmetrical and inverted folds.]\r\n\r\nBesides the anticlinal and synclinal folds already explained, there are\r\nfolds that slope in only one direction, one-sided or _monoclinal_ folds\r\n(Fig. 23). Anticlinal and synclinal folds are _symmetrical_ when the dip\r\nor slope of the strata is the same on both sides and the axial plane is\r\nvertical. The great majority of folds, however, are _unsymmetrical_, the\r\nopposite slopes being unequal, and the axial planes inclined to the\r\nvertical (Fig. 24, _A_). This means that the compressing or plicating\r\nforce has been greater from one side than from the other, as indicated\r\nby the arrows. It acted with the greatest intensity on the side of the\r\ngentler slope, the tendency evidently having been to crowd or tip the\r\nfold over in the direction of the steep slope. When the steep slope\r\napproaches the vertical, this tendency is almost unresisted, and when it\r\npasses the vertical, gravitation assists in overturning the fold (Fig.\r\n24, _B_). Such highly unsymmetrical folds, including all cases where the\r\ntwo sides of the fold slope in the same direction, are described as\r\n_overturned_ or _inverted_, although the latter term is not strictly\r\napplicable to the entire fold, but only to the strata composing the\r\nunder or lee side of it. Fig. 24, _B_, shows that these beds are\r\ncompletely inverted, the older, as the figures indicate, lying\r\nconformably upon the newer. This inversion is one of the most important\r\nfeatures of folded strata, and it has led to many mistakes in\r\ndetermining their order of succession. In the great mountain-chains,\r\nespecially, it is exhibited on the grandest scale, great groups of\r\nstrata being folded over and over each other as we might fold carpets.\r\nAn inverted stratum is like a flattened S or Z, and may be pierced by a\r\nvertical shaft three times, as has actually happened in some coal mines.\r\nFolds are _open_ when the sides are not parallel, and _closed_ when they\r\nare parallel, the former being represented by a half-open, and the\r\nlatter by a closed, book. Closed folds are usually inverted, and when\r\nthe tops have been removed by erosion (Fig. 25), the repetition of the\r\nstrata may escape detection, and the thickness of the section be, in\r\nconsequence, greatly overestimated. Thus, a geologist traversing the\r\nsection in Fig. 25 would see thirty-two strata, all inclined to the left\r\nat the same angle, those on the right apparently passing below those on\r\nthe left, and all forming part of one great fold. The repetition of the\r\nstrata in reverse order, as indicated by the numbers, and the structure\r\nbelow the surface, show, however, that the section really consists of\r\nonly four beds involved in a series of four closed folds, the true\r\nthickness of the beds in this section being only one-eighth as great as\r\nthe apparent thickness.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 25.—Series of closed folds.]\r\n\r\nThe most important features to be noted in observing and describing\r\ninclined or folded strata are the _strike_ and _dip_. The strike is the\r\ncompass bearing or horizontal direction of the strata. It is the\r\ndirection of the outcrop of the strata where the ground is level. It may\r\nalso be defined as the direction of a level line on the surface of a\r\nstratum, and is usually parallel with the axis of the fold.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 26.—Dip and strike.]\r\n\r\nThe dip is the inclination of the beds to the plane of the horizon, and\r\nembraces two elements: (_a_) the direction of the dip, which is always\r\nat right angles to the strike, being the line of steepest descent on the\r\nsurface of the stratum, and (_b_) the amount of the dip, which is the\r\nvalue of the angle between the line of steepest descent and the horizon.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 26, _s t_ is the direction of the strike, and _d p_ that of the\r\ndip. The strike and direction of the dip are determined with the\r\ncompass, and the amount of the dip with the clinometer, an instrument\r\nfor measuring vertical angles.\r\n\r\nThe strike is much less variable than the dip, being often essentially\r\nconstant over extensive districts; while the dip, except in very large\r\nor closed folds, is constantly changing in direction and amount.\r\n\r\nWhen the dip and surface breadth of a series of strata have been\r\nmeasured, it is a simple problem in trigonometry to determine the true\r\nthickness, and the depth below the surface of any particular stratum at\r\nany given distance from its outcrop. When the strata are vertical, the\r\nsurface breadth or traverse measure is equal to the thickness.\r\n\r\nBy the _outcrop_ of a stratum or formation we ordinarily understand its\r\nactual exposure on the surface, where it projects through the soil in\r\nledges or quarries. But the term is also more broadly defined to mean\r\nthe exposure of the stratum as it would appear if the soil were entirely\r\nremoved. It is instructive to observe the relations of the outcrop to\r\nthe form of the surface. Its breadth varies with its inclination to the\r\nsurface, appearing narrow and showing its true thickness where it is\r\nperpendicular to the surface, and broadening out rapidly where the\r\nsurface cuts it obliquely. The outcrops of horizontal strata form level\r\nlines or bands along the sides of hills and valleys, essentially contour\r\nlines in the topography; and appear as irregular, sinuous bands\r\nbordering the streams and valleys in the map-view of the country. The\r\noutcrops of vertical strata, dikes, or veins, on the other hand, are\r\nrepresented by straight lines and bands on the map. While the outcrops\r\nof inclined strata are deflected to the right or left in crossing ridges\r\nand valleys, according to the direction and amount of their inclination.\r\n\r\nA geological map shows the surface distribution of the rocks, _i.e._,\r\ngives in one view the forms and arrangement of the outcrops of all the\r\nrocks in the district mapped, including the trend or strike of the\r\nfolded strata. The map may be lithological, each kind of rock, as\r\ngranite, sandstone, limestone, etc., being represented by a different\r\ncolor; or, it may be historical, each color representing one geological\r\nformation, _i.e._, the rocks formed during one period of geological\r\ntime, without reference to their lithological character. But in the best\r\nmaps these two methods are combined. The geological section shows the\r\narrangement of the rocks below the surface, revealing the dip of the\r\nstrata and supplementing the map, both modes of representation, the\r\nhorizontal and vertical, being required to give a complete idea of the\r\ngeological structure of a country. For a detailed and satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the construction and use of geological maps and sections,\r\nstudents are referred to Prof. Geikie’s “Outlines of Field Geology.”\r\n\r\nCLEAVAGE STRUCTURE.—This important structure is now known to be, like\r\nrock-folds, a direct result of the great horizontal pressure in the\r\nearth’s crust. It is entirely distinct in its nature and origin from\r\ncrystalline cleavage, and may properly be called lithologic cleavage. It\r\nis also essentially unlike stratification and joint-structure. It agrees\r\nwith stratification in dividing the rocks into thin parallel layers, but\r\nthe cleavage planes are normally vertical instead of horizontal. And the\r\ncleavage planes differ from joints in running in only one direction,\r\ndividing the rock into layers; while joints, as we shall see, traverse\r\nthe same mass of rock in various directions, dividing it into blocks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 27.—Slaty cleavage in contorted strata.]\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristics of lithologic cleavage are: (1) It is\r\nrare, except in fine-grained, soft rocks, having its best development in\r\nthe slates, roofing slates and school slates affording typical examples.\r\nHence it is commonly known as _slaty cleavage_. (2) The cleavage planes\r\nare highly inclined or vertical, very constant in dip and strike, and\r\nquite independent of stratification. (3) It is usually associated with\r\nfolded strata, and often with distorted nodules or fossils. The more\r\nimportant of these characteristics are illustrated by Fig. 27. This\r\nrepresents a block of contorted strata in which the dark layers are\r\nslate with very perfect cleavage parallel to the left-hand shaded side\r\nof the block; while the white layers are sandstone and quite destitute\r\nof cleavage. Many explanations of this interesting structure have been\r\nproposed, but that first advanced by Sharpe may be regarded as fully\r\nestablished. He said that _slaty cleavage is always due to powerful\r\npressure at right angles to the planes of cleavage_. All the\r\ncharacteristics of cleavage noted above are in harmony with this theory.\r\nCleavage is limited to fine-grained or soft rocks, because these alone\r\ncan be modified internally by pressure, without rupture. Harder and more\r\nrigid rocks may be bent or broken, but they appear insusceptible of\r\nminute wrinkling or other change of structure affecting every particle\r\nof the mass. Since the cleavage planes are normally vertical, the\r\npressure, according to the theory, must be horizontal. That this\r\nhorizontal pressure exists and is adequate in direction and amount, is\r\nproved by the folds and contortions of the cleaved strata; for, as shown\r\nin Fig. 27, the cleavage planes coincide with the strike of the\r\nfoldings, and are thus perpendicular to the pressure horizontally as\r\nwell as vertically. The distortion of the fossils in cleaved slates is\r\nplainly due to pressure at right angles to the cleavage, for they are\r\ncompressed or shortened in that direction, and extended or flattened out\r\nin the planes of cleavage. Again, Tyndall has shown that the magnetism\r\nof cleaved slate proves that it has been powerfully compressed\r\nperpendicularly to the cleavage. And, finally, repeated experiments by\r\nSorby and others have proved that a very perfect cleavage may be\r\ndeveloped in clay (unconsolidated slate) by compression, the planes of\r\ncleavage being at right angles to the line of pressure. When, however,\r\nSharpe’s theory had been thus fully demonstrated, the question as to\r\n_how_ pressure produces cleavage still remained unanswered. Sorby held\r\nthat clay contains foreign particles with unequal axes, such as\r\nmica-scales, etc., and that these are turned by the pressure so as to\r\nlie in parallel planes perpendicular to its line of action, thus\r\nproducing easy splitting or cleavage in those planes. And he proved by\r\nexperiments that a mixture of clay and mica-scales does behave in this\r\nway. But Tyndall showed that the cleavage is more perfect just in\r\nproportion as the clay is free from foreign particles, and in such a\r\nperfectly homogeneous substance as beeswax, he developed a more perfect\r\ncleavage than is possible in clay. His theory, which is now universally\r\naccepted, is, that the clay itself is composed of grains which are\r\nflattened by pressure, the granular structure with irregular fracture in\r\nall directions, changing to a scaly structure with very easy and plane\r\nfracture or splitting in one definite direction.\r\n\r\nObservations on distorted fossils and nodules have shown that when slaty\r\ncleavage is developed, the rock is, on the average, reduced in the\r\ndirection of the pressure to two-fifths of its original extent, and\r\ncorrespondingly extended in the vertical direction. Thus, whether rocks\r\nyield to the horizontal pressure in the earth’s crust, by folding and\r\ncorrugation, or by the flattening of their constituent particles, they\r\nare alike shortened horizontally and extended vertically; and it is\r\nimpossible to overestimate the importance of these facts in the\r\nformation of mountains.\r\n\r\nFAULTS OR DISPLACEMENTS.—We may readily conceive that the forces which\r\nwere adequate to elevate, corrugate, and even crush vast masses of solid\r\nrock were also sufficient to crack and break them; and since the\r\nfractures indicate that the strains have been applied unequally, it will\r\nbe seen that unequal movements of the parts must often result. If this\r\nunequal movement takes place, _i.e._, if the rocks on opposite sides of\r\na fracture of the earth’s crust do not move together, but slip over each\r\nother, a _fault_ is produced. The two sides may move in opposite\r\ndirections, or in the same direction but unequally, or one side may\r\nremain stationary while the other moves up or down. It is simply\r\nessential that the movement should be unequal in direction, or amount,\r\nor both; that there should be an actual slip, so that strata that were\r\nonce continuous no longer correspond in position, but lie at different\r\nlevels on opposite sides of the fracture. The vertical difference in\r\nmovement is known as the _throw_, _slip_, or _displacement_ of the\r\nfault. Fault-fractures rarely approach the horizontal direction, but are\r\nusually highly inclined or approximately vertical. When the fault is\r\ninclined, as in Fig. 28, the actual slipping in the plane of the fault\r\nexceeds the vertical throw, for the movement is then partly horizontal,\r\nthe beds being pulled apart endwise. The inclination of faults, as of\r\nveins and dikes, should be measured from the vertical and called the\r\n_hade_. Faults are sometimes hundreds of miles in length; and the throw\r\nmay vary from a fraction of an inch to thousands of feet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 28.—Section of a normal fault.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 29.—Section of a reversed fault.]\r\n\r\nTransverse sections, such as are represented by Fig. 28 and many\r\nspecimens and models, do not give the complete plan or idea of a fault;\r\nbut this is seen more perfectly in Fig. 30. We learn from this that a\r\ntypical fault is a fracture along which the strata have _sagged_ or\r\nsettled down unequally. The most important point to be observed here is\r\nthat the strata do not drop bodily, but are merely bent, the throw being\r\ngreatest at the middle of the fault and gradually diminishing toward the\r\nends. In other words, every simple fault must die out gradually; for we\r\ncannot conceive of a fault as ending abruptly, except where it turns\r\nupon itself so as to completely enclose a block of the strata, which may\r\ndrop down bodily; but the fault is then really endless. A fault may be\r\nrepresented on a map by a line; if a simple fault, by a single straight\r\nline. But faults are often compound, and are represented by branching\r\nlines; that is, the earth’s crust has been broken irregularly, and the\r\nparts adjoining the fracture have sagged or risen unequally.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 30.—Ideal view of a complete fault.]\r\n\r\nThe rock above an inclined fault, vein, or dike (Fig. 28) is called the\r\n_hanging wall_, and that below the _foot wall_. Now inclined faults are\r\ndivided into two classes, according to the relative movements of the two\r\nwalls. Usually, the hanging wall slips down and the foot wall slips up,\r\nas in Fig. 28. Faults on this plan are so nearly the universal rule that\r\nthey are called _normal_ faults. They indicate that the strata were in a\r\nstate of tension, for their broken ends are pulled apart horizontally,\r\nso that a vertical line may cross the plane of a stratum without\r\ntouching it.\r\n\r\nA few important faults have been observed, however, in which the\r\nfoot-wall[**no hyphen before] has fallen and the hanging-wall[**] has\r\nrisen (Fig. 29). These are known as _reversed_ faults; and they indicate\r\nthat the strata were in a state of lateral compression, the broken ends\r\nof the beds having been pushed horizontally past each other, so that a\r\nvertical line or shaft may intersect the same bed twice, as has been\r\nactually demonstrated in the case of some beds of coal.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 31.—Explanation of normal faults.]\r\n\r\nThe usual explanation of normal faults is given in Fig. 31. The inclined\r\nfractures of the earth’s crust must often be converging, bounding, or\r\nenclosing large V-shaped blocks (_A_, _B_). If now, through any cause,\r\nas the folding of the strata, they are brought into a state of tension,\r\nso that the fractures are widened, the V-shaped masses, being\r\nunsupported, settle down, the fractures bounding them becoming normal\r\nfaults, as is seen by tracing the bed _X_ through the dislocations. The\r\nsingle fracture below the block _A_ is inclined, and the stretching has\r\nbeen accomplished by slipping along it and faulting the bed _Z_ as well\r\nas _X_, the entire section to the right of this fracture being part of a\r\nmuch larger V-shaped block the right-hand boundary of which is not seen.\r\nBut the united fracture below the block _B_ being vertical, any\r\nhorizontal movement must widen it into a fissure, which is kept open by\r\nthe great wedge above and may become the seat of a dike or mineral vein.\r\nThe beds below the V may, in this case, escape dislocation, as is seen\r\nby tracing the bed _Z_ across the fissure. These pairs of converging\r\nnormal faults are called _trough_ faults; and this is the only way in\r\nwhich we can conceive of important faults as terminating at moderate\r\ndepths below the surface, and not affecting the entire thickness of the\r\nearth’s crust.\r\n\r\nImportant reversed faults are believed to occur chiefly along the axes\r\nof overturned anticlines (Fig. 24) where the strata have been broken by\r\nthe unequal strains, and those on the upper side shoved bodily over\r\nthose on the lower or inverted side.\r\n\r\nAn extensive displacement of the strata is sometimes accomplished by\r\nshort slips along each of a series of parallel fractures, producing a\r\n_step_ fault.\r\n\r\nFaults cutting inclined or folded strata are divided into two classes,\r\naccording as they are approximately parallel with the direction of the\r\ndip or of the strike. The first are known as _transverse_ or _dip_\r\nfaults, and the second as _longitudinal_ or _strike_ faults. The chief\r\ninterest of either class consists in their effect upon the outcrops of\r\nthe faulted strata, after erosion has removed the escarpment produced by\r\nthe dislocation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 32.—Plan of a dip fault.]\r\n\r\nDip faults cause a lateral shift or displacement of the outcrops, as\r\nshown in Fig. 32, which represents a plan or map-view of the strata\r\ntraversed by the fault _b b_, the down throw being on the right and the\r\nup throw on the left. The dip of the strata is indicated by the small\r\narrows and the accompanying figures; and it will be observed on tracing\r\nthe outcrop of any stratum, _a a_, across the fault that it is shifted\r\nto the right. If the throw of the fault were reversed, the displacement\r\nof the outcrop would be reversed, also. Strike faults are of two kinds,\r\naccording as they incline in the same direction as the strata, or in the\r\ncontrary direction. The effect of the first kind is to conceal some of\r\nthe beds, as shown in Fig. 33, in which beds 5 and 6 do not outcrop, but\r\nwe pass on the surface abruptly from 4 to 7. The apparent thickness of\r\nthe section is thus less than the real thickness. When the fault\r\ninclines against the strata, on the other hand (Fig. 34), the outcrops\r\nof certain strata are repeated on the surface; and a number of parallel\r\nfaults of this kind, a step fault, will, like a series of closed folds\r\n(Fig. 25), cause the apparent thickness of the section to greatly exceed\r\nthe real thickness. Repetition of the strata by faulting is\r\ndistinguished from repetition by folding by being in the same instead of\r\nthe reverse order.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 33.—Strike fault, concealing strata.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 34.—Strike fault, repeating strata.]\r\n\r\nFolds and faults are really closely related. In the former the strata\r\nare disturbed and displaced by bending; in the latter by breaking and\r\nslipping; and the displacement which is accomplished by a fold may\r\ngradually change to a fracture and slip. This relation is especially\r\nnoticeable with monoclinal folds (Fig. 23), in which the tendency to\r\nshear or break the beds is often very marked.\r\n\r\nImportant faults are rarely simple, well-defined fractures; but, in\r\nconsequence of the enormous friction, the rocks are usually more or less\r\nbroken and crushed, sometimes for a breadth of many feet or yards. The\r\nfragments of the various beds are then strung along the fault in the\r\ndirection of the slipping, and this circumstance has been made use of in\r\ntracing the continuation of faulted beds of coal. In other cases the\r\ndirection of the slip is plainly indicated by the bending of the broken\r\nends of the strata (Fig. 35), and the beds are sometimes turned up at a\r\nhigh angle or even overturned in this way.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 35.—Section of beds distorted by a\r\n        fault.]\r\n\r\nSince faults are not plane, but undulating and often highly irregular,\r\nfractures, the walls will not coincide after slipping; and if the rocks\r\nare hard enough to resist the enormous pressure, the cavities or\r\nfissures produced in this way may remain open. Now faults are continuous\r\nfractures of the earth’s crust, reaching down to an unknown but very\r\ngreat depth; and hence they afford the best outlets for the heated\r\nsubterranean waters; so that it is common to find an important fault\r\nmarked on the surface by a line of springs, and these are often thermal.\r\nThe warm mineral waters on their way to the surface deposit part of the\r\ndissolved minerals in the irregular fissures along the fault, which are\r\nthus changed to mineral veins. This agrees with the fact that the walls\r\nof veins usually show faulting as well as crushed rock, slickensides,\r\nand other evidences of slipping.\r\n\r\nIf the earth’s surface were not subject to erosion, every fault would be\r\nmarked on the surface by an escarpment equal in height to the throw of\r\nthe fault; and, notwithstanding the powerful tendency of erosion to\r\nobliterate them, these escarpments are sometimes observed, although of\r\ndiminished height. Thus, according to Gilbert, the Zandia Mountains in\r\nNew Mexico are due to a fault of 11,000 feet, leaving an escarpment\r\nstill 7000 feet high. But, as a rule, there is no escarpment or marked\r\ninequality of the surface, the fault, like the fold, not being\r\ndistinctly indicated in the topography. In all such cases we must\r\nconclude either that the faults were made a very long time ago, or that\r\nthey have been formed with extreme slowness, so slowly that erosion has\r\nkept pace with the displacement, the escarpments being worn away as fast\r\nas formed. These and other considerations make it quite certain that\r\nextensive displacements are not produced suddenly, but either grow by a\r\nslow, creeping motion, or by small slips many times repeated at long\r\nintervals of time.\r\n\r\nJOINTS AND JOINT-STRUCTURE.—This is the most universal of all\r\nrock-structures, since all hard rocks and many imperfectly consolidated\r\nkinds, like clay, are jointed. Joints are cracks or planes of division\r\nwhich are usually approximately vertical and traverse the same mass of\r\nrock in several different directions. They are distinguished from\r\nstratification planes by being rarely horizontal, and from both\r\nstratification and cleavage planes by being actual cracks or fractures,\r\nand by dividing the rock into blocks instead of sheets or layers. The\r\nart of quarrying consists in removing these natural blocks; and most of\r\nthe broad flat surfaces of rock exposed in quarries, are the\r\njoint-planes (Fig. 36). Some of the most familiar features of\r\nrock-scenery are also due to this structure, cliffs, ravines, etc.,\r\nbeing largely determined in form and direction by the principal systems\r\nof joints; and we have already seen that the same is true of veins and\r\ndikes.\r\n\r\nJoints are divided by their characteristics and modes of origin into\r\nthree classes as follows:—\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 36.—Quarry showing two systems of\r\n        parallel joints.]\r\n\r\n1. _The parallel and intersecting joints._—This is by far the most\r\nimportant class, and has its best development in stratified rocks, such\r\nas sandstone, slate, limestone, etc. These joints are straight and\r\ncontinuous cracks which may often be traced for considerable distances\r\non the surface. They usually run in several definite directions, being\r\narranged in sets or systems by their parallelism. Thus in Fig. 36 one\r\nset of joints is represented by the broad, flat surfaces in light, and a\r\nsecond set crossing the first nearly at right angles, by the narrower\r\nfaces in shadow. By the intersections of the different sets of joints\r\nthe rock is divided into angular blocks.\r\n\r\nAlthough many explanations of this class of joints have been proposed,\r\nit has long been the general opinion of geologists that they are due to\r\nthe contraction of the rocks, _i.e._, that they are shrinkage cracks. We\r\nshall soon see, however, that they lack the most important characters of\r\ncracks known to be due to shrinkage; and the present writer has advanced\r\nthe view that movements of the earth’s crust, and especially the swift,\r\nvibratory movements known as earthquakes, are a far more adequate and\r\nprobable cause. It is well known that earthquakes break the rocks; and,\r\nif space permitted, it could be shown that the earthquake-fractures must\r\npossess all the essential features of parallel and intersecting joints.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 37.—Columnar dike.]\r\n\r\n2. _Contraction joints or shrinkage cracks._—That many cracks in rocks\r\nare due to shrinkage, there can be no doubt. The shrinkage may result\r\nfrom the drying of sedimentary rocks; but more generally from the\r\ncooling of eruptive rocks. Every one has noticed in warm weather, the\r\ncracks in layers of mud or clay on the shore, or where pools of water\r\nhave dried up; and we have already seen that these sun-cracks are often\r\npreserved in the hard rocks. They have certain characteristic features\r\nby which they may be distinguished from the joints of the first class.\r\nThey divide the clay into irregular, angular blocks, which often show a\r\ntendency to be hexagonal instead of quadrangular. The cracks are\r\ncontinually uniting and dividing, but are not parallel, and rarely cross\r\neach other. Sun-cracks never affect more than a few feet in thickness of\r\nclay, and are an insignificant structural feature of sedimentary rocks.\r\nIn eruptive rocks, on the other hand, the contraction joints have a very\r\nextensive, and, in some cases, a very perfect development, culminating\r\nin the prismatic or columnar jointing of the basaltic rocks. This\r\nremarkable structure has long excited the interest of geologists, and,\r\nalthough the basalt columns were once regarded as crystals, and later as\r\na species of concretionary structure, it is now generally recognized as\r\nthe normal result of slow cooling in a homogeneous, brittle mass. The\r\ncolumns are normally hexagonal, and perpendicular to the cooling\r\nsurface, being vertical in horizontal sheets and lava flows, as in the\r\nclassic examples of the Giant’s Causeway and Fingal’s Cave, and\r\nhorizontal in vertical dikes (Fig. 37). They begin to grow on the\r\ncooling surface of the mass and gradually extend toward the centre, so\r\nthat dikes frequently show two independent sets of columns.\r\n\r\n3. _The concentric joints of granitic rocks._—In quarries of granite and\r\nother massive crystalline rocks, it is often very noticeable that the\r\nrock is divided into more or less regular layers by cracks which are\r\napproximately parallel with the surface of the ground, some of the\r\ngranite hills having thus a structure resembling that of an onion. The\r\nlayers are thin near the surface, become thicker and less distinct\r\ndownwards, and cannot usually be traced below a depth of fifty or sixty\r\nfeet. These concentric cracks are of great assistance in quarrying, and\r\nare now regarded as due to the expansion of the superficial portions of\r\nthe granite caused by the heat of the sun. In reference to this view of\r\ntheir origin these may be properly called _expansion joints_.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF MOUNTAIN-CHAINS.—Mountains are primarily of two\r\nkinds,—volcanic and non-volcanic. The structure of the former belongs\r\nproperly with the original structures of the volcanic rocks; but the\r\nlatter—the true mountains—owe their internal structure and altitude or\r\nrelief almost wholly to the crumpling and mashing together of great\r\nzones of the earth’s crust, being, as already pointed out, the\r\nculminating points of the plication, cleavage, and faulting of the\r\nstrata. “A mountain-_chain_ consists of a great plateau or bulge of the\r\nearth’s surface, often hundreds of miles wide and thousands of miles\r\nlong. This is usually more or less distinctly divided by great\r\nlongitudinal valleys into parallel _ranges_ and _ridges_; and these,\r\nagain, are serrated along their crests, or divided into _peaks_ by\r\ntransverse valleys. In many cases this ideal chain is far from realized,\r\nbut we have instead, a great bulging of the earth’s crust composed on\r\nthe surface of an inextricable tangle of ridges and valleys of erosion,\r\nrunning in all directions. In all cases, however, the erosion has been\r\nimmense; for the mountain-chains are the great theatres of erosion as\r\nwell as of igneous action. As a general fact, all that we see, when we\r\nstand on a mountain-chain—every peak and valley, every ridge and cañon,\r\nall that constitutes scenery—is wholly due to erosion.”—LE CONTE.\r\n\r\nThe structure of mountains thus fells under two heads: (1) The internal\r\nstructure and altitude, which are due to the action of the subterranean\r\nagencies. (2) The external forms, the actual relief, which are the\r\nproduct chiefly of the superficial agencies or erosion. The study of\r\nmountains has shown that: (1) They are composed of very thick\r\nsedimentary formations. Thus the sedimentary rocks have a thickness of\r\n40,000 feet in the Alleghanies; of 50,000 feet in the Alps; and of two\r\nto ten miles in all important mountain-chains. Such thick deposits of\r\nsediments, as we have already seen, must be formed on a subsiding\r\nsea-floor, and in many mountain-chains, as in the Alleghanies, the great\r\nbulk of these sediments are still below the level of the sea. Again,\r\nthick sedimentary deposits can only be formed in the shallow, marginal\r\nportions of the sea; and when such a belt of thick shore deposits yields\r\nto the powerful horizontal thrust, and is crumpled and mashed up, it is\r\ngreatly shortened in the direction of the pressure and thickened\r\nvertically, so that its upper surface is lifted high above the level of\r\nthe sea, and a mountain-chain is formed and added to the edge of the\r\ncontinent. We thus find an explanation of the important fact that on the\r\nseveral continents, but notably on the two Americas, the principal\r\nmountain-ranges are near to and parallel with the coast lines.\r\n\r\n2. The mountain-forming sediments are usually strongly folded and\r\nfaulted, and exhibit slaty cleavage wherever they are susceptible of\r\nthat structure; and the older rocks, especially, in mountains are often\r\nhighly metamorphosed, and are traversed by numerous veins and dikes, the\r\ninfallible signs of intense igneous activity.\r\n\r\n“In other words, mountain regions have been the great theatres—(1) of\r\nsedimentation before the mountains were formed; (2) of plication and\r\nupheaval in the formation of the range; and (3) of erosion which\r\ndetermined the present outline. Add to these the metamorphism, the\r\nfaults, veins, dikes, and volcanic outbursts, and it is seen that all\r\ngeological agencies concentrate there.”—LE CONTE.\r\n\r\nSince mountain-ranges are great up-swellings or bulgings of the strata,\r\ntheir structure is always essentially anticlinal; and they sometimes\r\nconsist of a single more or less denuded anticline (Fig. 38), the oldest\r\nand lowest strata exposed forming the summit of the range. More\r\ncommonly, however, the single great arch or uplift is modified by a\r\nseries of longitudinal folds, as shown in the section of the Jura\r\nMountains (Fig. 21). Still more commonly the folds are closely pressed\r\ntogether, overturned, broken, and almost inextricably complicated by\r\nsmaller folds, contortions, and slips.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 38.—Anticlinal mountain.]\r\n\r\nThe strata on the flanks of the mountains are usually less disturbed\r\nthan those near the axis of the range, and are sometimes seen to rest\r\nunconformably against the latter. In this way it is proved that some\r\nranges are formed by successive upheavals. But we have still more\r\nconclusive evidence that mountains are formed with extreme slowness in\r\nthe fact that rivers sometimes cut directly through important ranges.\r\nThis proves, first, that the river is older than the mountains; second,\r\nthat the deepening of its channel has always kept pace with the\r\nelevation of the range.\r\n\r\nCONCRETIONS AND CONCRETIONARY STRUCTURE.—Folds, cleavage, faults, and\r\njoints—all the subsequent structures considered up to this point—are the\r\nproduct of mechanical forces. Chemical agencies, although very efficient\r\nin altering the composition and texture of rocks, are almost powerless\r\nas regards the development of rock-structures; and the only important\r\nstructure having a chemical origin is that named above.\r\n\r\nConcretions are formed by the segregation of one or more of the\r\nconstituents of a rock. But there are three distinct kinds of\r\nsegregation. If the water percolating through or pervading a rock,\r\ndissolves a certain mineral and afterwards deposits it in cavities or\r\nfissures, _amygdules_, _geodes_, or _veins_ are the result. If the\r\nmineral is deposited about particular points in the mass of the rock, it\r\nmay form _crystals_, the rock becoming _porphyritic_; or it may not\r\ncrystallize, but build up instead the rounded forms called\r\n_concretions_, the texture or structure of the rock becoming\r\n_concretionary_. A great variety of minerals occur in the form of\r\nconcretions, but this mode of occurrence is especially characteristic of\r\ncertain constituents of rocks, such as calcite, siderite, limonite,\r\nhematite, and quartz. Concretions may be classified according to the\r\nnature of the segregating minerals; and in each class we may distinguish\r\nthe _pure_ from the _impure_ concretions. A pure concretion is one\r\nentirely composed of the segregating mineral. Most nodules of flint and\r\nchert, quartz, geodes, concretions of pyrite, and many hollow iron-balls\r\nare good illustrations of this class. In all these cases the segregating\r\nmineral has been able in some way to remove the other constituents of\r\nthe rock, and make room for itself. But in other cases it has lacked\r\nthis power, and has been deposited between and around the grains of\r\nsand, clay, etc.; and the concretions are consequently _impure_, being\r\ncomposed partly of the segregating mineral, and partly of the other\r\nconstituents of the rock. The calcareous concretions known as\r\nclay-stones are a good example of this class, being simply discs of\r\nclay, all the minute interstices of which have been filled with\r\nsegregated calcite. The solid iron-balls are masses of sand filled in a\r\nsimilar manner with iron oxides.\r\n\r\nConcretions are of all sizes, from those of microscopic smallness in\r\nsome oölitic limestones up to those twenty-five feet or more in diameter\r\nin some sandstones.\r\n\r\nThe point of deposition, when a concretion begins to grow, is often\r\ndetermined by some concrete particle, as a grain or crystal of the same\r\nor a different mineral, a fragment of a shell, or a bit of vegetation,\r\nwhich thus becomes the nucleus of the concretion. The ideal or typical\r\nconcretion is spherical; but the form is influenced largely by the\r\nstructure of the rock. In porous rocks, like sandstone, they are\r\nfrequently very perfect spheres; but in impervious rocks, like clay,\r\nthey are flat or disc-shaped, because the water passes much more freely\r\nin the direction of the bedding than across it; while the concretions in\r\nlimestones, the nodules of flint and chert, are often remarkable for the\r\nirregularity of their forms. In all sedimentary rocks the concretions\r\nare arranged more or less distinctly in layers parallel with the\r\nstratification, which usually passes undisturbed through the impure\r\nconcretions. Many silicious and ferruginous concretions are hollow,\r\napparently in consequence of the contraction of the substance after its\r\nsegregation; and the shrinkage due to drying is still further indicated\r\nby the cracks in the septaria stones. The hollow, silicious concretions\r\nare usually lined with crystals (geodes), while the hollow iron-balls\r\nfrequently enclose a smaller concretion. Rocks often have a\r\nconcretionary structure when there are no distinct or separable\r\nconcretions. And the appearance of a concretionary structure\r\n(pseudo-concretions) is often the result of the concentric decomposition\r\nof the rocks by weathering, as explained on page 13.\r\n\r\nSUBSEQUENT STRUCTURES PRODUCED BY THE SUPERFICIAL OR AQUEOUS\r\nAGENCIES.—The superficial agencies, as we have seen in the section on\r\ndynamical geology, are, in general terms, water, air, and organic\r\nmatter. Geologically considered, the results which they accomplish, may\r\nbe summed up under the two heads of deposition and erosion—the formation\r\nof new rocks in the sea, and the destruction of old rocks on the land.\r\nIn the rôle of rock-makers they produce the very important original\r\nstructures of the stratified rocks; while as agents of erosion they\r\ndevelop the most salient of the subsequent structures of the earth’s\r\ncrust—the infinitely varied relief of its surface. As a general rule, to\r\nwhich recent volcanoes are one important exception, the original and\r\nsubterranean structures of rocks are only indirectly, and often very\r\nslightly, represented in the topography; for this, as we have seen, is\r\nalmost wholly the product of erosion. Therefore, what we have chiefly to\r\nconsider in this section is to what extent and how erosion is influenced\r\nby the pre-existing structures of rocks.\r\n\r\nHorizontal or very slightly undulating strata, especially if the upper\r\nbeds are harder than those below, give rise by erosion to flat-topped\r\nridges or table-mountains (Fig. 39). But if the strata be softer and of\r\nmore uniform texture, erosion yields rounded hills, often very steep,\r\nand sometimes passing into pinnacles, as in the Bad Lands of the west.\r\nBroad, open folds, as we have seen, give, normally, synclinal hills and\r\nanticlinal valleys (Fig. 22), when the erosion is well advanced. But in\r\nmore strongly, closely folded rocks the ridges and valleys are\r\ndetermined chiefly by the outcrops of harder and softer strata, as shown\r\nin Fig. 40, the symmetry of the reliefs depending upon the dip of the\r\nstrata. This principle of unequal hardness or durability also determines\r\nmost of the topographic features in regions of metamorphic and\r\ncrystalline rocks, in which the stratification is obscure or wanting.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 39.—Horizontal strata and\r\n        table-mountains.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 40.—Ridges due to the outcrops of hard\r\n        strata.]\r\n\r\nThe boldness of the topography, and the relation of depth to width in\r\nvalleys, depends largely upon the altitude above the sea; but partly,\r\nalso, upon the distribution of the rainfall, the drainage channels or\r\nvalleys being narrowest and most sharply defined in arid regions\r\ntraversed by rivers deriving their waters from distant mountains. That\r\nthese are the conditions most favorable for the formation of cañons is\r\nproved by the fact that they are fully realized in the great plateau\r\ncountry traversed by the Colorado and its tributaries, a district which\r\nleads the world in the magnitude and grandeur of its cañons. But deep\r\ngorges and cañons will be formed wherever a considerable altitude, by\r\nincreasing the erosive power of the streams, enables them to deepen\r\ntheir channels much more rapidly than the general face of the country is\r\nlowered by rain and frost. This is the secret of such cañons as the\r\nYosemite Valley, and the gorge of the Columbia River, and probably of\r\nthe fiords which fret the north-west coasts of this continent and\r\nEurope. For a full description and illustration of the topographic types\r\ndeveloped by the action of water and ice upon the surface of the land,\r\nand of the various characteristic forms of marine erosion, teachers are\r\nreferred to the larger works named in the introduction, especially Le\r\nConte’s Elements of Geology, and to the better works on physical\r\ngeography. We will, in closing this section, merely glance at some of\r\nthe minor erosion-forms, which are not properly topographic, but may be\r\noften illustrated by class-room and museum specimens. Mere weathering,\r\nthe action of rain and frost, develops very characteristic surfaces upon\r\ndifferent classes of rocks, delicately and accurately expressing in\r\nrelief those slight differences in texture, hardness, and solubility,\r\nwhich must exist even in the most homogeneous rocks. Every one\r\nrecognizes on sight the hard, smooth surfaces of water-worn rocks. They\r\nare exemplified in beach and river pebbles, in sea-worn cliffs, and\r\nwhere rivers flow over the solid ledges. The pot-hole (page 17) is a\r\nwell-marked and specially interesting rock-form, due to current or river\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nIce has also left highly characteristic traces upon the rocks in all\r\nlatitudes covered by the great ice-sheet. These consist chiefly of\r\npolished, grooved, and scratched or striated surfaces, the grooves and\r\nscratches showing the direction in which the ice moved.\r\n\r\nThe organic agencies, as already noted, accomplish very little in the\r\nway of erosion, especially in the hard rocks, but the rock-borings made\r\nby certain mollusks and echinoderms may be mentioned as one unimportant\r\nbut characteristic form due to organic erosion.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
