Gustave Trouvé is taken from a small\r\nvolume devoted to an account of his labors recently published by M.\r\nGeorges Dary. M. Trouvé, who may be said to have had no ancestors from\r\nan electric point of view, was born in 1839 in the little village of\r\nHaye-Descartes. He was sent by his parents to the College of Chinon,\r\nwhence he entered the École des Arts et Metiers, and afterward went\r\nto Paris to work in the shop of a clock-maker. This was an excellent\r\napprenticeship for our future electrician, since it is in small works\r\nthat electricity excels; and, if its domain is to be increased, it is\r\nonly on condition that the electric mechanician shall never lose sight\r\nof the fact that he should be a clock-maker, and that his fingers, to\r\nuse M. Dumas's apt words, should possess at once the strength of those\r\nof the Titans and the delicacy of those of fairies. It was not long ere\r\nTrouvé set up a shop of his own, whither inventors flocked in crowds;\r\nand the work he did for these soon gave up to him the secrets of the art\r\nof creating. The first applications that he attempted related to the use\r\nof electricity in surgery, a wonderfully fecund branch, but one whose\r\nimportance was scarcely suspected, notwithstanding the results\r\nalready obtained through the application of the insufflation pile to\r\ngalvano-cautery. What the surgeon needed was to see plainly into the\r\ncavities of the human body. Trouvé found a means of lighting these\r\nup with lamps whose illuminating power was fitted for that sort of\r\nexploration. This new mode of illumination having been adopted, it was\r\nbut natural that it should afterward find an application in dangerous\r\nmines, powder mills, and for a host of different purposes. But the\r\nperfection of this sort of instruments was the wound explorer, by the\r\naid of which a great surgeon sounded the wounds that Italian balls had\r\nmade in Garibaldi's foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUSTAVE TROUVE.]\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of France afterward directed Trouvé's attention to\r\nmilitary electricity, and led him to devise a perfect system of portable\r\ntelegraphy, in which his hermetic pile lends itself perfectly to all\r\nmaneuvers and withstands all sorts of moving about.\r\n\r\nThe small volume of which we have spoken is devoted more particularly to\r\nelectric navigation, for which M. Trouvé specially designed the motor of\r\nhis invention, and by the aid of which he performed numerous experiments\r\non the ocean, on the Seine at Paris, and before Rouen and at Troyes. In\r\nthis latter case M. Trouvé gained a medal of honor on the occasion of a\r\nregatta. Our engraving represents him competing with the rowers of whom\r\nhe kept ahead with so distinguished success. We could not undertake to\r\nenumerate all the inventions which we owe to M. Trouvé; but we cannot,\r\nhowever, omit mention of the pendulum escapement that beats the second\r\nor half second without any variation in the length of the balance; of\r\nthe electric gyroscope constructed at the request of M. Louis Foucault;\r\nof the electro-medical pocket-case; of the apparatus for determining the\r\nmost advantageous inclination to give a helix; of the electric bit for\r\nstopping unruly horses; and of the universal caustic-holder. He has\r\ngiven the electric polyscope features such that every cavity in the\r\nhuman body may be explored by its aid. As for his electric motor, he\r\nhas given that a form that makes the rotation regular and suppresses\r\ndead-centers--a result that he has obtained by utilizing the\r\neccentrization of the Siemens bobbin.\r\n\r\nAlthough devoting himself mainly to improving his motor (which, by\r\nthe way, he has applied to the tricycle), M. Trouvé does not disdain\r\ntelephony, but has introduced into the manufacture of magnets for the\r\npurpose many valuable improvements.--_Electricité_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TROUVE'S ELECTRIC BOAT COMPETING IN THE REGATTA AT\r\nTROYES, AUG. 6, 1882.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH WÖHLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighty-two years, and full of honor, after a life actively\r\ndevoted to scientific work of the highest and most accurate kind, which\r\nhas contributed more than that of any other contemporary to establish\r\nthe principles on which an exact science like chemistry is founded, the\r\nillustrious Wöhler has gone to his rest.\r\n\r\nAfter he had worked for some time with Berzelius in Sweden, he taught\r\nchemistry from 1825 to 1831 at the Polytechnic School in Berlin; then\r\ntill 1836 he was stationed at the Higher Polytechnic School at Cassel,\r\nand then he became Ordinary Professor of Chemistry in the University of\r\nGöttingen, where he remained till his death. He was born, July 31, 1800,\r\nat Eschersheim, near Frankfort-on-the-Main.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1828 it was believed that organic substances could only\r\nbe formed under the influence of the vital force in the bodies of\r\nanimals and plants. It was Wöhler who proved by the artificial\r\npreparation of urea from inorganic materials that this view could not be\r\nmaintained. This discovery has always been considered as one of the most\r\nimportant contributions to our scientific knowledge. By showing that\r\nammonium cyanate can become urea by an internal arrangement of its\r\natoms, without gaining or losing in weight, Wöhler furnished one of the\r\nfirst and best examples of isomerism, which helped to demolish the old\r\nview that equality of composition could not coexist in two bodies, A\r\nand B, with differences in their respective physical and chemical\r\nproperties. Two years later, in 1830, Wöhler published, jointly with\r\nLiebig, the results of a research on cyanic and cyanuric acid and on\r\nurea. Berzelius, in his report to the Swedish Academy of Sciences,\r\ncalled it the most important of all researches in physics, chemistry,\r\nand mineralogy published in that year. The results obtained were quite\r\nunexpected, and furnished additional and most important evidence in\r\nfavor of the doctrine of isomerism. In the year 1834, Wöhler and Liebig\r\npublished an investigation of the oil of bitter almonds. They prove by\r\ntheir experiments that a group of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms\r\ncan behave like an element, take the place of an element, and can be\r\nexchanged for elements in chemical compounds. Thus the foundation was\r\nlaid of the doctrine of compound radicals, a doctrine which has had\r\nand has still the most profound influence on the development of\r\nchemistry--so much so that its importance can hardly be exaggerated.\r\nSince the discovery of potassium by Davy, it was assumed that alumina\r\nalso, the basis of clay, contained a metal in combination with oxygen.\r\nDavy, Oerstedt, and Berzelius attempted the extraction of this metal,\r\nbut could not succeed. Wöhler then worked on the same subject, and\r\ndiscovered the metal aluminum. To him also is due the isolation of the\r\nelements yttrium, beryllium, and titanium, the observation that silicium\r\ncan be obtained in crystals, and that some meteoric stones contain\r\norganic matter. He analyzed a number of meteorites, and for many years\r\nwrote the digest on the literature of meteorites in the _Jahresbericht\r\nder Chemie_; he possessed, perhaps, the best private collection of\r\nmeteoric stones and irons existing. Wöhler and Sainte Claire Deville\r\ndiscovered the crystalline form of boron, and Wöhler and Buff the\r\nhydrogen compounds of silicium and a lower oxide of the same element.\r\nThis is by no means a full statement of Wöhler's scientific work; it\r\neven does not mention all the discoveries which have had great influence\r\non the theory of chemistry. The mere titles of the papers would fill\r\nseveral closely-printed pages. The journals of every year from 1820 to\r\n1881 contain contributions from his pen, and even his minor publications\r\nare always interesting. As was truly remarked ten years ago, when it was\r\nproposed by a Fellow of the Royal Society that a Copley medal should be\r\nconferred upon him, \"for two or three of his researches he deserves the\r\nhighest honor a scientific man can obtain, but the sum of his work is\r\nabsolutely overwhelming. Had he never lived, the aspect of chemistry\r\nwould be very different from that it is now.\"\r\n\r\nWhile sojourning at Cassel, Wöhler made, among other chemical\r\ndiscoveries, one for obtaining the metal nickel in a state of purity,\r\nand with two attached friends he founded a factory there for the\r\npreparation of the metal.\r\n\r\nAmong the works which he published were \"Grundriss der Anorganischen\r\nChemie,\" Berlin, 1830, and the \"Grundriss der Organischen Chemie,\"\r\nBerlin, 1840. Nor must we omit to mention \"Praktischen Uebringen der\r\nChemischen Analyse,\" Berlin, 1854, and the \"Lehrbuch der Chemie,\"\r\nDresden, 1825, 4 vols.\r\n\r\nAt a sitting of the Academy, held on October 2, 1882, M. Jean Baptiste\r\nDumas, the permanent secretary, with profound regret, made known\r\nthe intelligence of the death of the illustrious foreign associate,\r\nFriedrich Wöhler, professor in the University of Göttingen. He said: \"M.\r\nFriedrich Wöhler, the favorite pupil of Berzelius, had followed in the\r\nlines and methods of work of his master. From 1821 till his last year he\r\nhas continuously published memoirs or simple notes, always remarkable\r\nfor their exactness, and often of such a nature that they took among\r\ncontemporaneous production the first rank by their importance, their\r\nnovelty, or their fullness. Employed chiefly, during his sojourn in\r\nSweden, in work on mineral chemistry, he has remained all his life the\r\nundisputed chief in this branch of science in German universities. This\r\npreparation and preoccupation, which one might have thought sufficient\r\nto occupy his time, did not, however, prevent him from taking the chief\r\npart in the development of organic chemistry, and of filling one of the\r\nmost elevated positions in it.\r\n\r\n\"His contemporaries have not forgotten the unusual sensation produced by\r\nthe unexpected discovery by which he was enabled to make artificially,\r\nand by a purely chemical method, urea, the most nitrogenous of animal\r\nsubstances. Other transformations or combinations giving birth to\r\nsubstances which, until then, had only been met with in animals or\r\nplants, have since been obtained, but the artificial formation of urea\r\nstill remains the neatest and most elegant example of this order of\r\ncreation. All chemists know and admire the classical memoir in which\r\nWöhler and Liebig some time after made known the nature of the benzoic\r\nseries, and connected them with the radicals of which we may consider\r\nthem as being the derivatives comparable with products of a mineral\r\nnature. Their memoirs on the derivatives of uric acid, a prolific source\r\nof new and remarkable substances, has been an inexhaustible mine in the\r\nhands of their successors.\r\n\r\n\"This is not a moment when we should pretend to review the work which M.\r\nWöhler has done in mineral chemistry. Among the 240 papers which he has\r\npublished in scientific journals, there are few which the treatises of\r\nchemistry have not immediately turned to account. We need only confine\r\nourselves to the discovery of aluminum, to which the energy and\r\ninventive genius of our _confrère_, Henry Deville, soon gave a place\r\nnear the noble metals. United by a rivalry which would have divided\r\nless noble minds, these two great chemists carried on together their\r\nresearches in chemistry, and joined their forces to clear up points\r\nstill obscure in the history of boron, silicium, and the metals of\r\nthe platinum group, and remained closely united, which each year only\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\n\"The reader will pardon me a souvenir entirely personal. We were born,\r\nM. Wöhler and I, in 1800. I am his senior by a few days. Our scientific\r\nlife began at the same date, and during sixty years everything has\r\ncombined to bind more closely the links of brotherhood which has existed\r\nfor so long a time.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR HEBREW POPULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United Jewish Association has made a canvass of the denomination in\r\nthis country, finding 278 congregations, and a total Jewish population\r\nof 230,984. New York has the largest number--80,565. Then follows\r\nPennsylvania, with 20,000; California, with 18,580; Ohio with 14,581;\r\nIllinois, with 12,625, and Maryland, with 10,357.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish population in the largest cities is as follows:\r\n\r\n  New York         60,000\r\n  San Francisco    16,000\r\n  Brooklyn         14,000\r\n  Philadelphia     13,000\r\n  Chicago          12,000\r\n  Baltimore        10,000\r\n  Cincinnati        8,000\r\n  Boston            7,000\r\n  St. Louis         6,500\r\n  New Orleans       5,000\r\n  Cleveland         3,500\r\n  Newark            3,500\r\n  Milwaukee         3,500\r\n  Louisville        2,500\r\n  Pittsburg         2,000\r\n  Detroit           2,000\r\n  Washington        1,500\r\n  New Haven         1,000\r\n  Rochester         1,000\r\n\r\nThis total Jewish population of 230,984 has six hospitals, eleven\r\norphan asylums and homes, fourteen free colleges and schools, and 602\r\nbenevolent lodges. Of the free schools maintained by the Hebrews, five\r\nare in New York, four in Philadelphia, and one each in Cincinnati, St.\r\nLouis, Chicago, and San Francisco. Their hospitals are in New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati, New Orleans, and Chicago, while\r\ntheir orphan asylums, homes, and other benevolent institutions are\r\nscattered all over the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIES OF THE BAIKAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Angara is cold as ice all the summer through, so cold, indeed, that\r\nto bathe in it is to court inevitable illness, and in winter a sled\r\ndrive over its frozen surface is made in a temperature some degrees\r\nlower than that prevailing on the banks. This comes from the fact that\r\nits waters are fresh from the yet unfathomed depths of the Baikal, which\r\nduring the five short months of summer has scarcely time to properly\r\nunfreeze. In winter the lake resembles in all respects a miniature\r\nArctic Ocean, having its great ice hummocks and immense leads, over\r\nwhich the caravan sleds have to be ferried on large pieces of ice, just\r\nas in the frozen North. In winter, too, the air is so cold in the region\r\nabove the lake that birds flying across its icy bosom sometimes drop\r\ndown dead on the surface. Some authors say that seals have been caught\r\nin the lake of the same character as those found in the Arctic seas; for\r\nthis assertion I have no proof. An immense caravan traffic is carried\r\nacross the frozen lake every season between Russia and China. To\r\naccommodate this the Russian postal authorities once established a post\r\nhouse on the middle of the lake, where horses were kept for travelers.\r\nBut this was discontinued after one winter, when an early thaw suddenly\r\nset in, and horses, yemschliks and post house all disappeared beneath\r\nthe ice, and were never seen more. In summer the lake is navigated by an\r\nantiquated steamer called the General Korsakoff, which ventures out\r\nin calm weather, but cannot face the violent storms and squalls that\r\nsometimes rise with sudden impetuosity. Irkutskians say, indeed, that it\r\nis only upon Lake Baikal and upon this old hull that a man really learns\r\nto pray from his heart. The lake is held in superstitious reverence by\r\nthe natives. It is called by them Svyatoe More, or the Holy Lake, and\r\nthey believe that no Christian was ever lost in its waters, for even\r\nwhen a person is drowned in it the waves always take the trouble to cast\r\nthe body on shore.\r\n\r\nIts length is 400 miles, its width an average of 35 miles, covers an\r\narea of 14,000 square miles and has a circumference of nearly 1,200\r\nmiles, being the largest fresh water lake in the Old World, and, next to\r\nthe Caspian and the Aral, the largest inland sheet of water in Asia. Its\r\nshores are bold and rugged and very picturesque, in some places 1,000\r\nfeet high. In the surrounding forests are found game of the largest\r\ndescription, bears, deer, foxes, wolves, elk and these afford capital\r\nsport for the sportsmen of Irkutsk.\r\n\r\nAround the coasts are many mineral springs, hot and cold, which have a\r\ngreat reputation among the Irkutskians. The hot springs of Yurka, on the\r\nSelenga, 200 versts from Verchore Udevisk and not many miles from the\r\neastern shore of the Baikal, which have a temperature of 48 degrees\r\nRéaumur and whose waters are strongly impregnated with sulphur, are\r\na favorite watering place for natives as well as Russians and\r\nBuriats.--_Herald Correspondent with the Jeannette Search Expedition_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELING SAND HILLS ON LAKE ONTARIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of sand-drift occurs near Wellington Bay, on Lake\r\nOntario, ten miles from Pictou. The lake shore near the sand banks is\r\nindented with a succession of rock-paved bays, whose gradually shoaling\r\nmargins afford rare bathing grounds. East and West Lakes, each five\r\nmiles long, and the latter dotted with islands, are separated from\r\nLake Ontario by narrow strips of beach. Over the two mile-wide isthmus\r\nseparating the little lakes, the sand banks, whose glistening heights\r\nare visible miles away, are approached. On near approach they are hidden\r\nby the cedar woods, till the roadway in front is barred by the advancing\r\nbank, to avoid which a roadway through the woods has been constructed\r\nup to the eastern end of the sand range. The sand banks stretch like a\r\ncrescent along the shore, the concave side turned to the lake, along\r\nwhich it leaves a pebbly beach. The length of the crescent is over two\r\nmiles, the width 600 to 3,000 or 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\nClambering up the steep end of the range among trees and grapevines, the\r\nwooded summit is gained, at an elevation of nearly 150 feet. Passing\r\nalong the top, the woods soon disappear, and the visitor emerges on a\r\nwild waste of delicately tinted saffron, rising from the slate-colored\r\nbeach in gentle undulation, and sleepily falling on the other side down\r\nto green pastures and into the cedar woods. The whole surface of this\r\ngradually undulating mountain desert is ribbed by little wavelets a few\r\ninches apart, but the general aspect is one of perfect smoothness. The\r\nsand is almost as fine as flour, and contains no admixture of dust The\r\nfoot sinks only an inch or two in walking over it; children roll about\r\non it and down its slopes, and, rising, shake themselves till their\r\nclothing loses every trace of sand. Occasionally gusts stream over the\r\nwild waste, raising a dense drift to a height of a foot or two only, and\r\nstreaming like a fringe over the steep northern edge. Though the sun is\r\nblazing down on the glistening wilderness there is little sensation of\r\nheat, for the cool lake breeze is ever blowing. On the landward side,\r\nthe insidious approach of the devouring sand is well marked. One hundred\r\nand fifty feet below, the foot of this moving mountain is sharply\r\ndefined against the vivid green of the pastures, on which the grass\r\ngrows luxuriantly to within an inch of the sand wall. The ferns of the\r\ncedar woods almost droop against the sandy slope. The roots of the trees\r\nare bare along the white edge; a foot or two nearer the sand buries the\r\nfeet of the cedars: a few yards nearer still the bare trunks disappear;\r\nstill nearer only the withered topmast twigs of the submerged forest are\r\nseen, and then far over the tree tops stands the sand range. Perpetual\r\nice is found under the foot of this steep slope, the sand covering and\r\nconsolidating the snows drifted over the hill during the winter months.\r\nThere is something awe-inspiring, says the correspondent of the Toronto\r\nGlobe, in the slow, quiet, but resistless advance of the mountain front.\r\nField and forest alike become completely submerged. Ten years ago a\r\nfarm-house was swallowed up, not to emerge in light until the huge sand\r\nwave has passed over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN TEXTILE MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the recent exhibition at Boston of the New England Institute, several\r\ninteresting novelties were shown which have a promise of considerable\r\neconomic and industrial value.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents the general plan and pulley connections of the Harris\r\nRevolving-Ring Spinning Frame. The purpose of the improvements which\r\nit embodies is to avoid the uneven draught of the yarn in spinning and\r\nwinding incident to the use of a fixed ring. With the non-revolving ring\r\nthe strain upon the yarn varies greatly, owing to the difference\r\nin diameter of the full and empty bobbin. At the base of the cone,\r\nespecially in spinning weft, or filling, the diameter of the cop is five\r\nor six times that of the quill at the tip. As the yarn is wound upon the\r\ncone, the line of draught upon the traveler varies continually, the pull\r\nbeing almost direct where the bobbin is full, and nearly at right angles\r\nwhere it is empty. With the increasing angle the drag upon the traveler\r\nincreases, not only causing frequent breakages of the yarn, but also an\r\nunequal stretching of the yarn, so that the yarn perceptibly varies in\r\nfineness. The unequal strain further causes the yarn to be more tightly\r\nwound upon the outside than upon the inside of the bobbin, giving rise\r\nto snarls and wastage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN TEXTILE MACHINERY.--1,\r\n2.--SPINNING WITHOUT A MULE--THE HARRIS REVOLVING RING SPINNING FRAME.\r\n3, 4, 5.--NEW ELECTRIC STOP MOTION FOR DRAWING FRAMES. 6.--NEW POSITIVE\r\nMOTION LOOM.]\r\n\r\nThese difficulties have hitherto prevented the application of ring\r\nspinning to the finer grades of yarn. They are overcome in the new\r\nspinning frame by an ingenious device by which a revolving motion is\r\ngiven to the ring in the same direction as the motion of the traveler,\r\nthereby reducing its friction upon the ring, the speed of the ring being\r\nvariable, and so controlled as to secure a uniform tension upon the yarn\r\nat all stages of the winding.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the revolving ring is shown in Fig. 2. C is the\r\nrevolving ring; D, the hollow axis support; H, a section of the ring\r\nframe; E, the traveler.\r\n\r\nTo give the required variable speed to the revolving ring there is\r\nplaced directly over the drum, Fig. 1, A, for driving the spindle a\r\nsmaller drum, B, from which bands drive each ring separately. The shaft,\r\nwhich is attached by cross girts to the ring rail, and moves up and down\r\nwith it, is driven by a pair of conical drums from the main cylinder\r\nshaft; and is so arranged with a loose pulley on the large end of the\r\nreceiving cone as to remain stationary while the wind is on or near the\r\nbase of the bobbin. When the cone of the bobbin diminishes so as to\r\nmaterially increase the pull on the traveler, the conical drums are\r\nstarted by a belt shipper attached to the lilt motion. By the movement\r\nof the belt on these drums a continually accelerated motion is given to\r\nthe rings, their maximum speed being about one-twentieth the number\r\nof revolutions per minute as the spindle has at the same moment. This\r\naction is reversed when the lift falls. The tension of the wind upon\r\nthe bobbin is thus kept uniform, the desired hardness of the wind being\r\nsecured by the use of a heavier or lighter traveler according to the\r\ncompactness of cop required.\r\n\r\nThe model frame shown at the fair did its work admirably well, spinning\r\nyarns as high as No. 400, a fineness hitherto unattainable on ring\r\nframes. It is claimed that this invention can do whatever can be done\r\nwith the mule, and without the skilled labor which mule spinning\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nThis invention is exhibited by E. & A. W. Harris, Providence, R.I.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ELECTRIC STOP MOTION.\r\n\r\nFigs. 3, 4, and 5 illustrate some of the applications of the electric\r\nstop motion in connection with cotton machinery. The merit of this\r\ninvention lies in simplifying the means by which machinery may be\r\nstopped automatically the instant, its work, from accident or otherwise,\r\nbegins to be improperly done. The use of electricity for this purpose\r\nis made possible by the fact that comparatively dry cotton is a\r\nnonconductor of electricity. In the process of carding, drawing or\r\nspinning, the cotton is made to pass between rollers or other pieces\r\nforming parts of an electric circuit. So long as the machine is properly\r\nfed and in proper working condition, the stopping apparatus rests;\r\nthe moment the continuity of the cotton is broken or any irregularity\r\noccurs, electric contact results, completing the circuit and causing an\r\nelectro magnet to act upon a lever or other device, and the machine is\r\nstopped. The current is supplied by a small magneto-electric machine\r\ndriven by a band from the main driving shaft, and is always available\r\nwhile the engine is running.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows the general arrangement of the apparatus as applied to a\r\ndrawing frame. In the process of drawing down the roll of cotton--the\r\nsliver--four things may happen making it necessary to stop the machine.\r\nA sliver may break on the way from the can to the drawing rollers,\r\nor the supply of cotton may become exhausted; the cotton may lap or\r\naccumulate on the drawing rollers; the sliver may break between the\r\ndrawing rollers and the calender rollers; or the front can may overflow.\r\nIn each and all of these cases the electric circuit is instantly\r\ncompleted; the parts between which the cotton flows either come\r\ntogether, as when breakage occurs, or, if there is lapping, they are\r\nseparated so as to make contact above. In any case, the current causes\r\nthe electro-magnet, S, against the side of the machine to move its\r\narmature and set the stop motion in play.\r\n\r\nFigs. 4 and 5 represent in detail the manner in which electric\r\nconnection is made in two cases requiring the intervention of the stop\r\nmotion. In Fig. 4 the upper part of a receiving can is shown. When\r\nthe can is full the cotton lifts the tube wheel, J, until it makes an\r\nelectrical connection, and the stop motion is brought into instant\r\naction. In Fig. 5, the traction upon the yarn holds the hook borne by\r\nthe spring, F, away from G, and the electric circuit is interrupted. A\r\nbreakage of the yarn allows this spring to act; contact is made, and the\r\nstop motion operates as before.\r\n\r\nThis simple and efficient device is exhibited by Howard & Bullough &\r\nRiley, of Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW POSITIVE MOTION LOOM.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 shows the essential features of a positive motion loom, intended\r\nfor weaving narrow fabrics, exhibited by Knowles, of Worcester, Mass.\r\nThe engraving shows so clearly how, by a right and left movement of the\r\nrack, the shuttle is thrown by the action of the intermediate cogwheels,\r\nthat further description is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINNING WITHOUT A MULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the recent semi-annual meeting of the New England Cotton\r\nManufacturers' Association, held at the Institute of Technology, Boston,\r\nthe following paper on the Harris system of revolving ring spinning was\r\nread by Col. Webber for the author:\r\n\r\nIt is well known that one of the most serious difficulties in ring\r\nspinning is the variable pull upon the traveler, caused by the\r\ndifference in diameter of the full and empty bobbins, and this is\r\nespecially noticeable in spinning weft, or filling, when the diameter of\r\nthe quill at the tip is not over 3-16 of an inch, while that of the base\r\nof the cone, or full bobbin, is from an inch to an inch and one-eighth.\r\nThis variation in diameter causes the line of draught upon the traveler,\r\nwhich, with the full bobbin, forms nearly a tangent to the interior\r\ncircle of the ring, to be nearly radial to it with an empty one, and\r\nthis increased drag upon the traveler not only causes frequent breakage\r\nin spinning, but also stretches the yarn, so that it is perceptibly\r\nfiner when it is spun on the nose of the bobbin than when it is spun on\r\nthe bottom of the cone.\r\n\r\nEndeavors have been made to compensate for this difficulty by making\r\na less draught at that period of the operation; but we believe the\r\nprinciple of curing one error by adding another to be wrong, and aim by\r\nour improvement to avoid the cause of the trouble, which we do by giving\r\na revolving motion to the ring itself in the same direction as that of\r\nthe traveler, at a variable speed, so as to aid its slip, and reduce its\r\nfriction on the ring. This we accomplish by means of a shaft with whorls\r\non it, located directly over the drum for driving the spindle, from\r\nwhich bands drive each ring separately; and attached by cross-girts to\r\nthe ring-rail, and moving up and down with it.\r\n\r\nThis shaft is driven by a pair of conical drums from the main cylinder\r\nshaft, and is so arranged with a loose pulley on the large end of the\r\nreceiving cone as to remain stationary while the wind is on or near the\r\nbase of the bobbin, or nearly parallel to the path of the traveler.\r\n\r\nWhen the cone of the bobbin begins to diminish to such a point as to\r\nmaterially increase the radial pull on the traveler, these conical drums\r\nare put in operation by a belt shipper attached to the lift motion,\r\nwhich moves the belt on to the cones, and gives a continually\r\naccelerated motion to the rings, so that when the wind reaches the top\r\nof the bobbin the rings will have their maximum speed of about 300\r\nrevolutions per minute, or about one-twentieth the number of revolutions\r\nof the spindle at this point, if the latter make 6000 revolutions per\r\nminute, and this we find in actual practice to produce results which are\r\nhighly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAs the lift falls again, the belt is moved back on the cones, giving a\r\nretarding motion to the rings, until it reaches the point at which it\r\nbegan to operate, and is then either moved on to the loose pulley, and\r\nthe rings remain stationary, or for very fine yarn are kept in motion at\r\na slow speed. We are often asked if this does not affect the twist, but\r\nanswer that it does not in the least, as the relative speeds of the\r\nrolls and spindles remain the same, and the only thing that can be\r\naffected is the hardness of the wind upon the bobbin, and this is\r\nadjustable by the use of a heavier or lighter traveler, according to the\r\ncompactness of cop required.\r\n\r\nWe claim by means of this improvement the ability to use a much smaller\r\nquill or bobbin, and consequently holding as much yarn in a less outside\r\ndiameter, enabling us to use a smaller ring, thus saving power both in\r\nthe weight of bobbin to be carried and in the distance to be moved by\r\nthe traveler; and we believe the power to be saved in this manner and by\r\nthe diminution of the dead pull on the traveler, when the wind is at\r\nthe tip of the bobbin, to be more than sufficient to give the necessary\r\nmotion to the revolving rings. We are as yet unable to answer this\r\nquestion of power fully, as we have not yet tested a full size frame,\r\nbut we propose to do this in season to answer all questions at the next\r\nmeeting of your association.\r\n\r\nThe same invention is also applicable to warp spinning, by giving the\r\nring a continuous accelerating and retarding motion, in which the\r\nmaximum speed is given to the ring at the first start of the frame when\r\nthe bobbin is empty, sufficient to diminish the strain on the yarn,\r\nand gradually reducing the motion at each traverse of the rail, as the\r\nbobbin is filled; but we claim the great advantage of our invention to\r\nbe the capability of spinning any grade of yarn on the ring frame that\r\ncan be spun on the hand or self-operating mule, and in proof of this we\r\ncall your attention to the model frame now in operation at the fair of\r\nthe New England Manufacturers' and Mechanics' Institute, where we are\r\nspinning on a quill only 5-32 inches diameter at top, and where we can\r\nshow you samples of yarn from No. 80 to No. 400 spun on this frame from\r\ncombed roving from the Conant Thread Company and Willimantic Linen\r\nCompany, which we believe has never before been accomplished on any ring\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to examine this invention at the fair, and also call your\r\nattention to the adjustable roller beam, by means of which the rolls can\r\nbe adjusted at any desirable angle or pitch, so as to throw the twist\r\nmore or less directly spinning, and an improvement in the quality of the\r\nyarn from the same cause, which will increase the production from the\r\nloom, and finally eradicate other objectionable features of the labor\r\nquestion, which so often disturb the peaceful harmony between labor and\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nMr, Goulding asked if it had been demonstrated whether more or less\r\npower was required for the same numbers than effect of running the\r\nmachine a little out of true, and the reply was that the advantage of\r\nthe new method over the old would be more apparent in such a case than\r\nwith a perfect frame. In regard to speed, the inventor proposed as\r\na maximum rate, when the wind was at the tip of the bobbin, 300\r\nrevolutions per minute, but from this point the speed would diminish.\r\n\r\nConant Thread Company and Willimantic Linen Company, which we believe\r\nhas never before been accomplished on any ring frame.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to examine this invention at the fair, and also call your\r\nattention to the adjustable roller beam, by means of which the rolls can\r\nbe adjusted at any desirable angle or pitch, so as to throw the twist\r\nmore or less directly into the bite of the rolls, according to the\r\ncharacter of the yarn desired, or the quality of the stock used.\r\n\r\nFinally, we claim, by the use of this invention, to be able to spin any\r\nfibrous material which can be drawn by draught-rolls, of any required\r\ndegree of softness of twist, such as can be spun by any mule whatever,\r\nand to do this with the attention only of children of from twelve to\r\nfourteen years of age.\r\n\r\nWe also claim an increased production, owing to less breakage of ends,\r\nfrom the yarn not being overstrained in spinning, and an improvement in\r\nthe quality of the yarn from the same cause, which will increase the\r\nproduction from the loom, and finally eradicate other objectionable\r\nfeatures of the labor question, which so often disturb the peaceful\r\nharmony between labor and capital.\r\n\r\nMr. Goulding asked if it had been demonstrated whether more or less\r\npower was required for the same numbers than by other methods, and Col.\r\nWebber replied that no more power was required to move the rings than\r\nwas saved by friction on the ring and the saving of weight of the\r\nbobbins. He thought it required no more power than the old way.\r\n\r\n_The method of lubricating the ring_.--The inventor, who was present,\r\nstated, in response to a query, that he claimed an advantage for his\r\nring in spinning all numbers from the very coarsest up, both in quality\r\nand quantity, and especially the former.\r\n\r\nMr. Garsed inquired of Col Webber what would be the effect of running\r\nthe machine a little out of true, and the reply was that the advantage\r\nof the new method over the old would be more apparent in such a case\r\nthan with a perfect frame. In regard to speed, the inventor proposed\r\nas a maximum rate, when the wind was at the tip of the bobbin, 300\r\nrevolutions per minute, but from this point the speed would diminish.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested by a member that the only advantage of a revolving ring\r\nwas to relieve the strain on the traveler just to the extent of the\r\nring's revolutions. If the ring were making 300 revolutions per minute,\r\nand the traveler 6,000, the strain on the latter would be equal to 5,700\r\nrevolutions on a stationary ring. Col. Webber, however, thought that the\r\nmotion of the ring gave the traveler a lift that prevented its stopping\r\nat any particular point, and cited the fact that all numbers up to 400\r\ncould be spun with this ring as proof of its superiority over the old\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW GAS BURNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking at the last meeting of the Gaslight and Coke Company, Mr.\r\nGeorge Livesey said many things with a view to inspire confidence of the\r\nfuture in the minds of timid gas proprietors. Among others he mentioned\r\nthe advances now being made by invention in regard to improved\r\nappliances for developing the illuminating power of coal gas, with\r\nespecial reference to a new burner just patented by Mr. Grimston. Mr.\r\nLivesey passed a very high encomium upon the burner, and this expression\r\nof opinion by such an authority is sufficient to arouse deep interest in\r\nthe apparatus in question. It is therefore with much pleasure that we\r\npresent our readers with the following early account of Mr. Grimston's\r\nburner, for which we are indebted to the inventor and Mr. George Bower,\r\nof St. Neots, in whose manufactory the burners are now being made in all\r\nsizes. It should be premised, to save disappointment, that the invention\r\nis yet so fresh that its ultimate capabilities are unknown. The\r\naccompanying illustration, therefore, represents the bare skeleton of\r\none of the first models; and the actual performance of only the very\r\nearliest burner, made in great part by Mr. Grimston himself, has been\r\nfully tested. Before proceeding to describe the invention, a brief\r\nhistory may be interesting of how it happened that Mr. Grimston, an\r\nelectric lighting engineer, became a gas burner maker. The story will\r\nundoubtedly help to explain the reasons for many of the characteristics\r\nof the new burner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED GAS BURNER. FIG. 1.--Sectional Elevation.]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that Mr. Grimston, who was connected with the\r\nelectrical engineering establishment of Siemens Bros. & Co., Limited,\r\nwas some months ago shown the construction and working of the Siemens\r\nregenerative gas burner, which is now sufficiently well known to render\r\na description unnecessary here. In common with most spectators of this\r\nvery ingeniously and philosophically designed appliance, Mr. Grimston\r\nwas struck with its bulk and the superficial clumsiness of the\r\narrangement whereby the air and gas supply are heated in it by the\r\nproducts of combustion. These lamps have, of course, materially improved\r\nof late; but when Mr. Grimston first saw them, perhaps 18 months ago,\r\nthey certainly could not be called neat and compact in design. He\r\nat once grasped the idea embodied in these lamps, and set about\r\nconstructing an arrangement which should be based on a similar\r\nprinciple, but at the same time avoid the inconveniences complained of.\r\nIt is not too much to say that he has succeeded in both these aims, and\r\nthe burner which now bears his name strikes the observer at once by\r\nthe brilliant light which it produces by the simplest and most\r\nobvious means. We may now describe, by reference to the accompanying\r\nillustrations, how Mr. Grimston produces the regenerative effect which\r\nis likewise the central idea of the Siemens burner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED GAS BURNER. FIG. 2.--Section through A B.]\r\n\r\nThe light is simply that produced by an arrangement of a kind of Argand\r\nburner turned upside down. The central gas-pipe, _a_ (Figs. 1 and 3), is\r\nconnected to a distributing chamber, whence the annular cluster of brass\r\ntubes, _a', a_, (Figs. 1 and 2), are prolonged downward, forming the\r\nburner. The burner is inclosed in an iron or brass annular casing, b, b,\r\nwhich forms the main framework of the apparatus. The annular space which\r\nit affords is the outlet chimney or flue for the products of combustion\r\nof the burner beneath, and is crossed by a number of thin brass tubes,\r\nc, c, which lead from the outer air into the inner space containing\r\nthe burner tubes, a', a', already described. The upper openings of the\r\nannular body, b, are shown at e, e (Fig. 3), which communicate direct\r\nwith the chimney proper, e', e'. The burner is lighted by opening the\r\nhinged glass cover, d, which fits practically air-tight on the bottom\r\nof the body, so that the air needed to support combustion must all pass\r\nthrough the tubes, c, c, the outer ends of which are protected by the\r\ncasing, k, k.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED GAS BURNER. FIG. 3.--Section through C D.]\r\n\r\nWhen the gas is lighted at the burner, and the glass closed, the burner\r\nbegins to act at once, although some minutes are necessarily required\r\nto elapse before its full brilliancy is gained. The cold air passes in\r\nthrough the tubes provided for it, and when these are heated to the\r\nfullest extent on their outside, by the hot fumes from the burner, they\r\nso readily part with their heat to the air that a temperature of 1,000°\r\nto 1,200° Fahr. is easily obtained in the air when it arrives inside,\r\nand commences in turn to heat the burner-tubes. The air-tubes are placed\r\nso as to intercept the hot gases as completely as possible; and also, of\r\ncourse, obtain heat by conduction from the sides of the annular body.\r\nIt is evident that the number and dimensions of these tubes might be\r\nincreased so as to abstract almost all the heat from the escaping fumes,\r\nbut for the limitations imposed, first, by a consideration of the actual\r\nquantity of air required to support combustion, and, secondly, by the\r\nobligation to let sufficient ascensional power remain in the gases which\r\nare left to pass out through the upper chimney. If the gases are cooled\r\ntoo much, they will either fall back into the lamp and extinguish the\r\nflame, or will be removable only by the draught of a long chimney. It\r\nwill probably be the aim of the inventor to balance these requirements,\r\nand so to produce burners with very short or longer chimneys, according\r\nas appearance is to be consulted or the highest possible effect\r\nproduced. The burner is a ring of brass tubes of considerable diameter,\r\nin proportion to the quantity of gas consumed, and thus provides for\r\nthe delivery of gas expanded by heat. In connection with this device\r\nan explanation may be found of the failure of the British Association\r\nCommittee on Gas Burners to find any advantage from previously heating\r\nthe air and gas consumed. The Committee did not make the necessary\r\nprovision for the increased bulk of the combustible and its air supply,\r\ncaused by their heightened temperature; and the same quantity of gas\r\nmeasured cold (at the meter) could only be driven through the ordinary\r\nsmall burner holes at a velocity destructive of good results. Herr\r\nFrederick Siemens perceived this in his early experiments, and not only\r\nincreased the orifices of his burners, but provided for the closer\r\ncontact of the more rarefied gas and air by the use of notched\r\ndeflectors, which are now an essential part of his apparatus. Mr.\r\nGrimston also uses separate tubes of large area for his hot gas, but\r\ndispenses with deflectors, save in so far as the same duty may be\r\nperformed by the plain lower edge of the inner cylinder of the lamp\r\nbody, and the indentation of the glass beneath, which, as will be\r\nnoticed, is made to follow the shape of the flame. It only remains now\r\nto speak of the flame and its qualities. It is, in the first place, a\r\nflame of hot gas, burning at an extremly small velocity of flow, and\r\nwholly exposed to view from the exact point which it is required to\r\nlight. In this latter respect it differs materially, and with advantage,\r\nfrom the Siemens burner, which, while presenting an extremely brilliant\r\nand beautiful ball of flame outside its central tube of porcelain, may\r\nyet be tailing smokily downward inside this opaque screen, and thereby\r\ncausing unperceived waste. The flame of the Grimston burner, on the\r\nother hand, is quite exposed, and all its light, from the ends of the\r\nburner-tubes to the point where visible combustion ceases, is made\r\navailable for use. As a perfect Argand flame in the usual position has\r\nbeen likened in form to a tulip flower, so the flame of this burner\r\npresents the appearance of an inverted convolvulus. So far as he has\r\nalready gone, Mr. Grimston prefers to keep the tubes of the burner at\r\nsuch a distance from each other that the several jets part at the point\r\nwhere they turn upward, so that the convolvulus figure is not maintained\r\nto the edge of the flame. From its peculiar position the light is, of\r\ncourse, completely shadowless as regards the lamp which affords it; and\r\nthis, of itself, is no small recommendation for a pendant. It shows well\r\nfor the simplicity and effectiveness of the perfected burners that Mr.\r\nGrimston's experimental example, although necessarily imperfect In many\r\nways, burns with a remarkably steady light, of great brilliancy, which\r\nis assured by the fact that the products of combustion are robbed of all\r\ntheir heat to magnify the useful effect, so that the hand may be borne\r\nwith ease over the outlet of the chimney. With respect to the endurance\r\nof the apparatus, it will be sufficient to remark that there is nothing\r\nin the gas or air heating arrangements to get out of order, and they are\r\nall easily accessible while the burner is in action. The glass is not\r\nliable to breakage, although it is in close proximity to the flame, as\r\nmay be gathered from the testimony of the inventor, who has never broken\r\none, notwithstanding the severity of some of his experimental studies\r\nupon his first lamp. The consumption of gas in the first working-model\r\nburner made by Mr. Grimston was 10 cubic feet per hour, and its\r\nilluminating power averaged 60 candles. The diameter of this burner was\r\n1¼ inches across the tubes. It is scarcely necessary to state that if\r\nthis high duty, which was obtained with the ordinary 16-candle gas of\r\nthe Gaslight and Coke Company, can be maintained, to say nothing of\r\nbeing exceeded, in the commercial article, the Grimston burner, with its\r\nother advantages over all existing methods of obtaining equal results,\r\nhas a great future before it. For example, it does not require a\r\nseparate air supply under high pressure, or any extra material to render\r\nincandescent, and it may be turned on full immediately upon lighting. It\r\nthrows a shadowless light, and lends itself to ventilating arrangements;\r\nand it is not by any means cumbersome, delicate in construction, or\r\ncostly in manufacture. One of the greatest advantages to which it lays\r\nclaim is, however, the power of yielding almost as good results in a\r\nsmall burner as in a large one. This is a consideration of great moment,\r\nwhen it is remembered that the tendency of most of the high power\r\nburners hitherto introduced is to benefit the lighting of streets,\r\nlarge interiors, and, generally speaking, points of great consumption.\r\nMeanwhile, the private user of burners, consuming from 3 to 5 cubic feet\r\nof gas per hour, has been left to attain as best he might, by the use of\r\nburners excellent of their kind, to the maximum effect of the standard\r\nArgand. Now, however, Mr. Grimston seeks to make the small consumer\r\npartake of the advantages erstwhile reserved for the wholesale user of\r\nlarge and costly Siemens and other lamps, and he even looks to this\r\nclass of patrons with particular care. The example which we now\r\nillustrate, in Fig. 1, is a sectional presentment precisely half the\r\nactual size of a 5-foot burner, which it is intended to prepare for\r\nthe market before all others. Another simple form of the burner, with\r\nvertical tubes, will, we understand, be introduced as soon as possible.\r\nIt will be readily understood that the principle is capable of being\r\nembodied in many shapes; and it is satisfactory to learn that the\r\ninventor is quite alive to the necessity of producing a cheap as well as\r\na good burner.\r\n\r\nGas companies, as Mr. Livesey has expressed it, will be well content\r\nwith a slower relative growth of consumption, if their consumers are at\r\nthe same time making their gas go as far again as formerly, by the use\r\nof burners which turn nominal 16-candle gas into gas of 30-candle actual\r\nilluminating power. How far Mr. Grimston's invention may succeed in this\r\nwork it is not for us to say. It is sufficient for the present that\r\nhe has done excellently well in showing how Herr Frederick Siemens'\r\nscientific principles of regenerative gas burner construction may\r\nbe carried out yet in another way. There is nothing more common in\r\nindustrial annals than for one man to begin a work which another is\r\ndestined to bring to greater perfection. Whether this natural process is\r\nto be repeated in the present instance must be left for the future to\r\ndecide. In any case, Mr. Grimston's success, if success is to be his\r\nreward, though it will be well merited by his ingenuity and perseverance\r\nin solving a difficult problem, will never cause us to forget the\r\nprior claims of Herr Frederick Siemens, of Dresden, to the palm of the\r\ndiscoverer. Mr. Grimston may or may not be the happy inventor of the\r\nbest gas-burner of the day; but there is the consolation of knowing that\r\nin the same field in which he will find his recompense there is room for\r\nany number and variety of useful improvements of a like character and\r\nobject.--_Journal of Gas Lighting_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFTY'S IMPROVEMENTS IN GAS BURNERS AND HEATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong other inventors who have turned their attention to gas consumption\r\nis to be found Mr. H. Defty, who has made several forms both of heating\r\nand lighting burners. Mr. Defty has sought in the latter to apply the\r\nprinciple of heating the air and gas in a simple manner, with the object\r\nof obtaining improved photometrical results. The double-chimney\r\nArgand, as tried many years since by Dr. Frankland and others, makes\r\na reappearance in one of Mr. Defty's models, illustrated in the\r\naccompanying diagram (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nHere we have the double-chimney, a and b, for heating the air supplied\r\nto an ordinary Argand, by causing it to pass downward between the two\r\nchimneys, and inward to the point of combustion through a wire-gauze\r\nscreen, c, under the inner chimney; but, in addition thereto, Mr. Defty\r\nhopes to gain an improved result by causing the gas to pass through the\r\ninternal tube, s, which rises up in the middle of the flame. The gas,\r\nwhich enters at e, is made to pass up through the inner tube and down\r\nthrough the annular space to the burner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nA more important form of lantern is the subject of the next diagram\r\n(Fig. 2), which shows a suspended globe lantern in which there is an\r\nattempt made to heat the air by the waste heat of the products of\r\ncombustion. It will be perceived by the diagram that a globe lantern is\r\nfurnished with a double chimney; the annular space, C, between the\r\ninner and outer chimneys allowing for the access of air in a downward\r\ndirection. At the lower of this annular channel are the tubes D,\r\nprotected by the graduated mesh, E, and which admit the air to the\r\nburner below. The products of combustion of the flame rise through the\r\ninner chimney, passing around the tubes, and thereby giving up some of\r\ntheir heat to the incoming air. Farther up, the chimney is partly filled\r\nwith the convoluted gas-pipe, A, which also takes up some of the waste\r\nheat, and delivers the gas to the burner at a correspondingly high\r\ntemperature. A very simple method of lighting this burner, which in\r\nitself does not present anything remarkable, is arranged at the lower\r\npart of the globe, where a hole is cut and a loose conical glass plug\r\n(which can, of course, be made to partake of the general ornamentation\r\nof the globe) may be pushed up to allow of the passage of the lighting\r\nagent, and is then dropped in its place again. Formal tests of the\r\nperformances of these burners are not available; and the same may be\r\nsaid of the heating burners which are shown in the following diagrams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these (Fig. 3) is called by Mr. Defty a \"pyramid heater,\"\r\nand is designed to heat the mixture of air and gas before ignition, by\r\nconduction from its own flame. The inventor claims to effect a perfect\r\ncombustion in this manner with considerable economy of fuel. It is\r\nevident, however, that a good deal of the gas consumed goes to heat the\r\nburner itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe next and last of Mr. Defty's productions to be at present described\r\nis the so-called \"crater burner,\" shown herewith (Fig. 4). This is an\r\natmospheric burner which is purposely made to \"fire back,\" as well as\r\nto burn on the top of the apparatus. The body of the burner, like the\r\npyramid heater just described, is full of fire-clay balls, which become\r\nvery hot from the lower flame, and thus, after the burner has been for\r\nsome time in action, a pale, lambent blaze crowns the top, apparently\r\ngreater in volume than when it is first lighted. Here, again, there is a\r\nlamentable absence of reliable data as to economic results, which will,\r\nperhaps, be afforded when the apparatus in question is ready to be\r\noffered to the public.\r\n\r\nWhether one inventor or another succeeds in distancing his rivals, it is\r\nmatter, says _The Journal of Gas Lighting_, for sincere congratulation\r\namong the friends of gas lighting that so much attention is being\r\nconcentrated upon the improvement of gas burners for all purposes. This\r\nis an open field which affords scope for more workers than have yet\r\nentered upon it, and there is the certainty of substantial reward to\r\nwhoever can realize a worthy advance upon the established practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BINDING MACHINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cuts represent two new machines for binding together\r\nbooks and pamphlets. They are the invention of Messrs. Brehmer & Co.,\r\nand are now much used in England and Germany. The material used for\r\nbinding is galvanized iron wire.\r\n\r\n_Machine Operated by Hand_ (Fig. 1).--This machine serves for fastening\r\ntogether the pages of pamphlets through the middle of the fold, or for\r\nbinding together several sheets to form books up to a thickness of about\r\nhalf an inch.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a small cast-iron frame, with which is articulated a\r\nlever, _i_, maneuvered by a handle, _h_. This lever is provided at its\r\nextremity with a curved slat, in which engages a stud, fixed to the\r\nlower part of a movable arm, _c_, whose extremity, _d_, rises and\r\ndescends when the lever handle, _h_, is acted upon. This maneuver can be\r\nlikewise performed by the foot, if the handle, _h_, be connected with a\r\npedal, X, placed at the foot of the table that supports the machine,\r\nas shown in Fig. 2. The lever, _i_, is always drawn back to its first\r\nposition, when left to itself, by means of the spring, _z_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED BINDING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe staples for binding have nearly the form of the letter U, and are\r\nplaced, to the number of 250 or 300, on small blocks of wood, _m_. To\r\nprepare the machine for work, the catch, _a_, is shoved back, and the\r\nwhole upper part of the piece, _b_, is removed. The rod, _e_, with its\r\nspring, is then drawn back until a small hole in _e_ is perceived,\r\nand into this there is introduced the hook, _f_, which then holds the\r\nspring. The block of wood, _m_, filled with staples, is then rested\r\nagainst a rectangular horizontal rod, and into this latter the staples\r\nare slipped by hand. The upper part of the piece, _b_, is next put in\r\nplace and fastened with the catch, _a_. Finally, the spring is freed\r\nfrom the hook, _f_. When it is desired to bind the pages of a pamphlet,\r\nthe latter is placed open on the support, _g_, which, as will be\r\nnoticed, is angular above, so that the staple may enter exactly on the\r\nline of the fold. Then the handle, _h_, is shoved down so as to act on\r\nthe arm, _c_, and cause the descent of the extremity, _d_, as well as\r\nthe vertical piece, _b_, with which it engages. This latter, in its\r\ndownward travel, takes up one of the staples, which are continually\r\nthrust forward by the rod and spring, and causes it to penetrate the\r\npaper. At this moment, the handle, _h_, makes the lever, _n_, oscillate,\r\nand this raises, through its other extremity, a vertical slide whose\r\nhead bends the two points of the staple toward each other. The handle,\r\n_h_, is afterward lifted, the position of the pamphlet is changed, and\r\nthe same operation is repeated. When it is desired to form a book from\r\na number of sheets, the table, _l_, is mounted on the support, _g_, its\r\ntwo movable registers are regulated, and the sheets are spread out flat\r\non it. The machine, in operating, drives the staples in along the edge\r\nof the sheets, and the points are bent over, as above indicated.\r\n\r\nThe axis on which the lever, _i_, is articulated is eccentric, and is\r\nprovided on the side opposite the lever with a needle, _k_, revolving\r\non a dial. The object of this arrangement is to regulate the machine\r\naccording to the thickness of the book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n_Machine to be Operated by a Motor_ (Fig. 3).--This machine, although\r\nworking on the same principle, is of an entirely different construction.\r\nIt is designed for binding books of all dimensions. It consists of a\r\nframe, _a_, in two pieces, connected by cross-pieces, and carries a\r\ntable, _u_, designed to receive the sheets before being bound together.\r\nMotion is transmitted by means of a cone, _c_, mounted loose on the\r\nshaft, _b_. To start the machine, the foot is pressed on the pedal, _m_,\r\nwhich, through the intermedium of links and arms, brings together the\r\nfriction plates, _d_, one of which is connected with the shaft, _b_, and\r\nthe other with the cone, _c_. When it is desired to stop the machine,\r\nthe pedal is left free to itself, while the counterpoise, _s_, ungears\r\nthe friction plates. The machine fastens the paper with galvanized iron\r\nwire wound round bobbins placed at the side of the apparatus. This wire\r\nit cuts, and forms into staples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe book to be bound is placed on the support, _h_, and the arms, _k_,\r\nthat carry the fasteners cause it to move backward and forward. It also\r\nundergoes a second motion--that is, it moves downward according to the\r\nnumber and thickness of its pages. This motion, which takes place\r\nevery time the operator adds a new sheet, is regulated by a cog-wheel\r\nregister, _l_, which is divided, and provided with a needle.\r\n\r\nThe iron wires pass from the bobbins on a support to the left of the\r\nmachine by means of feed rollers, which thrust them through the eight\r\nclips. In the interior of these latter there is a double knife, which,\r\nactuated by one of the cams of the wheel, _e_, cuts the wire and bends\r\nit thus [Inline Illustration]. The extremities of the staples are thrust\r\nthrough the back of the half opened leaves, and then bent toward each\r\nother thus [Inline Illustration], by the front fastener. This motion is\r\neffected by means of two levers, _p_ (moved by the cams, _e_), whose\r\nextremities at every revolution of the machine seize by the two ends a\r\nlink that maneuvers the fasteners. The binding of one sheet finished,\r\nthe lower arms of the machine again take their position, the wires move\r\nforward the length necessary to form new staples, a new sheet is laid,\r\nand the same operation is proceeded with. The number of staples and\r\ntheir distance are changed, according to the size of the book, by\r\nintroducing into the machine as much wire as will be necessary for the\r\nstaples. To prevent their number from increasing the thickness of the\r\nback of the book (as would happen were they superposed), the support,\r\n_h_, moves laterally at every blow, so as to cause the third staple to\r\nbe driven over the first, the second over the fourth, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUMES AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn crossing ravines in this State, flumes or wrought iron pipes are\r\nused. Many miners object to flumes on account of their continual cost\r\nand danger of destruction by fire. Where used and practicable, they\r\nare set on heavier grades than ditches, 30 to 35 ft. per mile, and,\r\nconsequently, are proportionately of smaller area than the ditches. In\r\ntheir construction a straight line is the most desirable. Curves, where\r\nrequired, should be carefully set, so that the flume may discharge its\r\nmaximum quantity. Many ditches in California have miles of fluming. The\r\nannexed sketch, drawn by A. J. Bowie, Jr., will show the ordinary style\r\nof construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF FLUME.]\r\n\r\nThe planking ordinarily used is of heart sugar pine, one and a half to\r\ntwo inches thick, and 12 to 18 inches wide. Where the boards join, pine\r\nbattens three inches wide by one and a half thick cover the seam. Sills,\r\nposts, and caps support and strengthen the flume every four feet. The\r\nposts are mortised into the caps and sills. The sills extend about\r\n20 inches beyond the posts, and to them side braces are nailed to\r\nstrengthen the structure. This extension of the sill timbers affords a\r\nplace for the accumulation of snow and ice, and in the mountains such\r\naccumulations frequently break them off, and occasionally destroy a\r\nflume.\r\n\r\nTo avoid damage from slides, snow, and wind storms, the flumes are set\r\nin as close as possible to the bank, and rest, wholly or partially, on\r\na solid bed, as the general topography and costs will admit. Stringers\r\nrunning the entire length of the flume are placed beneath the sills just\r\noutside of the posts. They are not absolutely necessary, but in point of\r\neconomy are most valuable, as they preserve the timbers. As occasion\r\nmay demand, the flume is trestled, the main supports being placed every\r\neight feet. The scantling and struts used are in accordance with the\r\nrequirements of the work.--_Min. and Sci. Press_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHUWAB'S ROLLING MILL FOR DRESSING AND ROUNDING BAR IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new forge apparatus has been devised for the purpose of finishing\r\nup round irons of all diameters while hot, as they come out of\r\nthe ordinary rolling mill, by rendering them perfectly circular,\r\ncylindrical, straight, smooth, and level at the extremities, as if they\r\nhad passed through a slide lathe. Such a high degree of external finish\r\nis a very valuable feature in those round irons that are employed in so\r\ngreat quantity for shafting, cylindrical axles, etc., as well as in the\r\nmanufacture of bolts and locks. Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the opposite\r\nengraving will allow it to be seen that this apparatus which is usually\r\ninstalled at the side of the finishing cylinder is, in part, beneath\r\nthe general level of the forge floor. It may be placed parallel with or\r\nperpendicular to the apparatus that it does duty for, this depending\r\nupon the site at disposal or the mode of transmission.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists essentially of two tempered iron cylinders, A,\r\n0.5 of a meter in diameter by 1.5 meters in length, revolving in the\r\n_same direction_ (contrary to what takes place in ordinary rolling\r\nmills) between two frames, B, that are open on one side to allow of\r\nthe entrance of the finishing bar. This latter is held between the\r\ncylinders, A, which roll it so much the faster in proportion as its\r\ndiameter is smaller, and by a scraper guide, C, of the same length as\r\nthe cylinder table, and which may be regulated at will by bolts, c,\r\nfixed to the frame, B. The bottom cylinder remains always in the same\r\nposition, while the axle, D, which carries the intermediate wheels, E,\r\nmoves about to gear in all the relative positions of the cylinders. The\r\ndisplacement of the upper cylinder is effected through the clamping\r\nscrews, b, which are actuated by toothed disks that gear with two\r\nendless screws keyed at the extremities of one shaft in common, d, which\r\nis set in motion by hand through the winches, m m. The scraper guards, e\r\ne, take up and throw aside all scales that might become attached to the\r\ncylinders, which are constantly moistened by small streams of water\r\ncoming from an ordinary conduit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHUWAB'S DRESSING AND ROUNDING ROLLING MILL.\r\n\r\nFig. 1--Elevation and Longitudinal Section.\r\n\r\nFig. 2--Side View.\r\n\r\nFig. 3--Transvers Section.\r\n\r\nFig. 4--Plan View.\r\n\r\nFigs. 5 & 6--Saws for Dressing the Extremities of the Bars.\r\n\r\nFig. 7--Diagram Showing the Motion of the Wheels and Guide.\r\n\r\nFigs. 8 & 9--Apparatus for Shifting tha Bars.]\r\n\r\nAs the driving belts are mounted on pulleys, G, of a diameter\r\nproportioned to the velocity of the shafting, the iron pinions, h, in\r\norder to produce 60 revolutions per minute in the first shaft, H, gear\r\non each side with the intermediate wheels, E, and these actuate the\r\ntwo bronze pinions, a a, that are mounted on the extremities of the\r\ncylinders, A A. The axle, D, of the intermediate wheels does not revolve\r\nwith them, but is capable of rising and descending in the elongated\r\naperture that traverses the frames, B. The displacement of this axle is\r\nsecured through the arms, L L, whose extremities articulate on the one\r\nhand with the cylinders, A A, and on the other with D. The result of\r\nthis is that every displacement upward of the top cylinder corresponds\r\nto a different position of the intermediate shaft, and one that is\r\nalways equidistant from the centers of the cylinders, A A, thus securing\r\na constant gearing of the wheels in all the positions of the cylinders,\r\nA A.\r\n\r\nThe diagram in Fig. 7 shows the relative displacements of all these\r\nparts, as well as those of the scraper guide, C. The diameter to be\r\nobtained is determined beforehand by the two contact screws, P.\r\n\r\nThe whole thus regulated, the bar of iron, still very hot, coming from\r\nthe ordinary rollers, is straightened up, if need be, by a few blows of\r\na hammer, so that it may roll forward over the pavement, N, between the\r\nrounding cylinders, A A; these being held apart sufficiently to allow\r\nof its easy introduction. Next, a few revolutions of the winches that\r\ncontrol the screws suffice to lower the upper cylinder to the exact\r\nposition limited by the contact screws, P, and the bar is rolled between\r\nthe two cylinder tables with a constant velocity in the generatrices. As\r\na consequence, the number of revolutions made is so much the greater in\r\nproportion as the diameter of the shaft is smaller with respect to that\r\nof the cylinders.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that the bar, during its rotation under pressure,\r\nis held by the guide, C, so that its diagrammatic axis (Fig. 7) exceeds\r\nthe line, A A, joining the centers of the cylinders just enough to\r\nprevent its escape to the opposite, and so that the pressure upon the\r\nsaid guide (which performs the role of scraper) is merely sufficient to\r\ndetach the scales which form during the operation.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, and at a velocity of 30 revolutions per minute in\r\nthe two cylinders, it will take but a fraction of a minute to finish\r\na bar the length of the table, that is to say, 1.5 meters. Then, by\r\nloosening the upper cylinder, the bar may be easily shoved along in one\r\ndirection or the other, so as to continue the finishing operation\r\non successive lengths. This moving of the bar forward is further\r\nfacilitated by the aid of a clamp with rollers and a movable socket,\r\nV (Figs. 8 and 9). For large diameters (150 millimeters and beyond)\r\ntraction is employed by the aid of two small windlasses placed opposite\r\neach other, and at a distance apart twice the greatest length of the\r\nbars to be finished. The chains of these windlasses are attached to the\r\nextremities by clamps that lock by the pulling exerted.\r\n\r\nThe details of the arrangement of the saws (Figs. 5 and 6) show that to\r\nmake a section of the ends or of any other part of the bar, it is only\r\nnecessary to lower the lever of one them. By reason of the contrary\r\nrotation of the bar, the effective stress on the lever will be very\r\nmoderate, while the cut produced will be a clean and quickly performed\r\none. It should be remarked that, as a consequence of the cone on the\r\nprojecting extremity of the cylinder journals (Fig. 5), and on the\r\nrollers that control the saws, it is only necessary to move the lever to\r\nthe right or left in order to stop the motion of each of the saws. These\r\nlatter, to prevent all possibility of accident, are inclosed within\r\nsemicircular guards. Finally, the controlling rollers are made of a\r\nmaterial which is quite elastic (compressed cardboard, for example), so\r\nthat they may roll smoothly and adhere well.\r\n\r\nFrom what precedes, it will be seen that round iron bars of any diameter\r\nwill come from this apparatus completely finished. It will be seen\r\nalso that with cylinders of suitable profile, there might likewise be\r\nfinished axles, or pieces that are more or less conical as well as those\r\nprovided with shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus may, if preferred, be driven by small special motors\r\naffixed to the frame. Such an arrangement, which is more costly than the\r\npreceding, is, nevertheless, indicated in cases where shafting would be\r\nin the way.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the materials entering into the construction of this\r\nmachine, proposed by Mr. Chuwab, includes about 15 tons of metal,\r\nof which 5,000 kilogrammes are for the two tempered cylinders; 250\r\nkilogrammes of iron screws, and 350 of bolts; and 500 kilogrammes of\r\nbronze, 90 of which are for nuts.--_Revue Industrielle_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURNING OF TOWN REFUSE AT LEEDS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From selected papers of the Institution of Civil Engineers,\r\nLondon, by Charles Slagg, Assoc. Memb. Inst. C.E.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn large towns it is necessary to adopt some regular system of removal\r\nand disposal of the cinders and ashes of house fires, and of the animal\r\nand vegetable refuse of the houses, and, in short, of everything thrown\r\naway which cannot be admitted into the sewers. In towns where the\r\nexcreta are separated by means of water closets, the disposal of the\r\nother refuse presents less difficulty, but still a considerable one,\r\nbecause the animal and vegetable refuse is not kept separate from the\r\ncinders and ashes, all being thrown together into the ash pit or dust\r\nbin. The contents, therefore, cannot be deposited upon ground which may\r\nafterward be built upon, although that custom obtained generally in\r\nformer times. Hence the refuse has been removed to a depot where that\r\nwretched industry is created of picking out the other parts from the\r\ncinders and ashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--DESTRUCTOR.\r\n\r\nElevation.\r\n\r\nSection through feeding-holes of cells.\r\n\r\nSection through air-passages of cells.]\r\n\r\nBut in towns unprovided with water closets, or so far as they are not\r\nadopted in any town, where the privies are connected with the ash pits,\r\nand where, consequently, the excreta of the population are added to the\r\nother contents of ash pits, the difficulties of removal and disposal of\r\nthe refuse are much increased.\r\n\r\nWhere the privy-ashpit system is in use--as it still is to a large\r\nextent--as much of the contents of the ash pits as can be sold at any\r\nprice, however small, are collected separately from the drier portions,\r\nand sent out of town as manure; but what remains is still too offensive\r\nto be deposited on ground near the town; and when it is attempted to\r\ncollect the excreta separately by the pail system, the process is no\r\nless unsatisfactory. These difficulties led to the adoption, under the\r\nadvice of the late Mr. A.W. Morant, M. Inst. C.E., the Borough Engineer\r\nat Leeds, of Fryer's method of destruction by burning--that is, of the\r\ndry ashes and cinders and the animal and vegetable refuse. The\r\nauthor was Mr. Morant's assistant. The first kiln was constructed at\r\nBurmantofts, 1½ miles from the center of the town in a northeasterly\r\ndirection, and has been in use since the beginning of the year 1878. In\r\n1879 another kiln was constructed at Armley Road, a mile from the center\r\nof the town in a west-southwesterly direction, which has been in use\r\nsince the beginning of 1880.\r\n\r\nEach destructor kiln has six cells, three in each face of a block of\r\nbrick work 22 feet long, 24 feet through from face to face, and 12 feet\r\nhigh. Each cell is 8 feet long and 5 feet wide, arched over, the height\r\nbeing 3 feet 4 inches, and both the bottom and arch of the cell slope\r\ndown to the furnace doors with an inclination of 1 in 3. The lower end\r\nof each cell has about 26 square feet of wrought-iron firebars, the\r\nhearth being 4½ feet above the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--CARBONIZER.\r\n\r\nSection through furnaces.\r\n\r\nLongitudinal section.\r\n\r\nCross section.]\r\n\r\nThere are two floors, one on the ground level, a few feet only above the\r\noutlet for drainage, the other floor, or raised platform, being 15 feet\r\nabove it. The refuse is taken in carts up an incline of 1 in 14 on\r\ncast-iron tram plates to the upper floor, and deposited upon and\r\nalongside of the destructor, and is shoveled into a row of hoppers at\r\nthe head of the cells. These hoppers are in the middle of the width of\r\nthe destructor, and each communicates with a cell on each side of it.\r\nThe refuse is always damp, and often wet, and after being put into\r\nthe cells is gradually dried by the heat reflected upon it from the\r\nfirebrick arch of the cell, before it descends to the furnace. This\r\ndistinguishes the system from the common furnace, and enables the wet\r\nmaterial to be burned without other fuel. No fresh fuel is used after\r\nthe fires are once lighted. The vapor passes off with the gases of\r\ncombustion into a horizontal flue between the two rows of cells, through\r\nan opening at the head of each cell, alongside that through which the\r\nrefuse is fed into it, the two openings being separated by a firebrick\r\nwall. The refuse is prevented from falling into the flue by a bridge\r\nwall across the outlet opening, over which the gases pass into the flue.\r\n\r\nBetween the destructor and the chimney a multitubular boiler is placed,\r\nwhich makes steam enough for grinding into sand the clinkers which are\r\nthe solid residue of the burnt refuse. At Burmantofts an old chimney was\r\nmade use of, which is but 84 feet high; but at Armley Road a new chimney\r\nwas built, 6 feet square inside and 120 feet high. It is necessary to\r\nmake the horizontal flue large; that at Armley Road is 9 feet high and 4\r\nfeet wide. A large quantity of dust escapes from the cells--about 7 cwt.\r\na month--and unless the velocity of the air in the flue between the\r\ndestructor and the chimney were checked, the dust would be carried up\r\nthe chimney and might cause complaints; as, indeed, it has done with the\r\n120-foot chimney, but whether with any substantial grounds is uncertain.\r\nThe dust is removed from the horizontal flue or dust chamber once a\r\nmonth. Experience seems to indicate that there should be some sort of\r\nguard or grating to prevent the entry into the chimney of charred paper\r\nand similar light substances which do not fall to dust, and which are\r\nsometimes carried up with the draught.\r\n\r\nA six-celled destructor kiln burns about 42 tons of refuse in\r\ntwenty-four hours, leaving about one-fourth of its bulk of clinkers and\r\nashes. The clinkers are withdrawn from the furnaces five times each day\r\nand night, or about every two-and-a-half hours, into iron barrows, and\r\nwheeled outside the shed which covers the destructor, and when cold are\r\nwheeled back to the mortar mills, of which there are two at each depot,\r\neach having a revolving pan 8 feet in diameter, with 27-cwt. rollers,\r\nthe pan making twenty two revolutions a minute. Forty shovelfuls of\r\nclinkers and twelve of slaked lime make 7 cwt. of mortar in thirty-five\r\nminutes in each pan, which is sold at 5s. 6d. per ton. The engine\r\ndriving the two mortar mills has a 14 inch cylinder, 30 inches length\r\nof stroke, and makes sixty revolutions per minute with 45 pounds steam\r\npressure per square inch in the boiler, when both mortar mills are\r\nrunning. The boiler is 11 feet long, 8 feet in diameter, and has 132\r\ntubes 4 inches in external diameter, which, together with the external\r\nflues, are cleaned out once a month.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it would probably appear that no good mortar could be\r\nmade from such refuse as has been described, but having passed through\r\nthe furnace, the clinkers are, of course, perfectly clean, and with good\r\nlime make a really strong and excellent mortar. They are also largely\r\nused for the foundation of roadways.\r\n\r\nThe number of men employed is as follows: Two furnace men in the daytime\r\nand two at night. They work from midnight on Sundays to 2 P.M. on\r\nSaturdays, the fires being fully charged and left to burn through the\r\nSundays. One foreman, who attends also to the running of the engine, and\r\none mortar man. A watchman attends while the workmen are off.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a destructor, there is at the Burmautofts depot a\r\n\"carbonizer\" kiln, in which the sweepings of the vegetable markets are\r\nburned into charcoal. The carbonizer consists of eight vertical cells,\r\nin two sets or stacks of four, separated by a space containing two\r\ndouble furnaces, back to back, there being a double furnace also at each\r\nend of the eight cells. Each of the stacks of four cells is 15 feet\r\n6 inches high; the ends and middle parts, forming the tops of the\r\nfurnaces, being 6 feet high. The block of brick work containing the\r\neight cells and furnaces is 26 feet 6 inches long and 12 feet 4 inches\r\nwide at the floor level. Each cell is 3 feet 6 inches by 2 feet, and\r\nabout 10 feet deep, with a chamber below about 3 feet deep, into which\r\nthe charred material falls and is completely burned. The top of the\r\ncells is level with the upper platform, and they are fed through a loose\r\ncover, which is immediately replaced. Inside the cells cast-iron sloping\r\nshelves are hung upon the walls so that their upper edges touch the\r\nwalls, but the lower edges are some inches off, so that the hot air of\r\nthe furnaces passes upward behind the shelves round the four sides of\r\nthe cell in a spiral manner, and out near the top into a vertical flue,\r\nwhich conducts it down to the horizontal flue at the bottom, which leads\r\nto the chimney. The charcoal is withdrawn from the bottom of the heating\r\nchamber through a sliding plate 2 feet above the floor, and is wheeled\r\nred hot to the charcoal cooler, which is a revolving cylinder, nearly\r\nhorizontal, kept cool by water falling upon it, and delivers the\r\ncharcoal in two degrees of fineness at the end. It is worked by a small\r\nattached engine, supplied with steam from the boiler before mentioned.\r\nEach cell of the carbonizer can reduce to charcoal 50 cwt. of vegetable\r\nrefuse in twenty four hours, but at Leeds not quite so much is put\r\nthrough. The quantity of market refuse passed through six cells of the\r\ncarbonizer varies from 3 to 10 tons a day, and averages about 4½ tons,\r\nfrom which 15 cwt. of charcoal is obtained. The fuel for burning the\r\ncharcoal is derived from the ash pit refuse, some selected loads being\r\nfor that purpose passed over a sloping screen fixed between the upper\r\nplatform and the furnace floor, the fine ashes which pass through the\r\nscreen being taken away to the manure heaps, and the combustible parts\r\nto the furnaces of the carbonizer. In this way a good deal of the ash\r\npit refuse is got rid of; it is often one-twelfth part of the whole\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nThe carbonizer and the destructor are set 33 feet apart, to allow room\r\nfor drawing the furnaces and for the mortar mills, but the space is\r\nhardly sufficient. One man is employed in attending to the carbonizer.\r\n\r\nBesides the openings at the top of the destructor through which the ash\r\npit refuse is fed into the cells, there is a larger opening in each\r\ncell, kept covered usually, through which bed mattresses ordered by the\r\nmedical sanitary office to be destroyed can be put into the cells. These\r\nopenings are midway between the central openings and the furnace doors,\r\nand whatever is put into the cells through these comes into immediate\r\ncontact with the fire. Advantage is taken of these openings for the\r\ndestruction of dead animals and diseased meat, and as much as 20 tons in\r\na year have been passed through the destructor.\r\n\r\nThe whole works are roofed over. The lower floor is open on two sides,\r\nbut the upper one is closed in, with weather boarding at Burmantofts and\r\nwith corrugated iron at Armley Road. At the former place the works\r\nwere in some measure experimental, and the platform was constructed\r\nof timber, but at Armley Road it is of plate-iron girders, with brick\r\narching, weight being considered advantageous in reducing the vibration\r\nof carting heavy loads over it.\r\n\r\nThe cost of each depot has been £4,500, exclusive of land, of which\r\nabout an acre is required for the destructor, carbonizer, inclined road,\r\nweigh office, and space. A supply of water is necessary, a good deal\r\nbeing required for cooling the clinkers. The population of the two\r\ndistricts belonging to these works is about 160,000.\r\n\r\nThe author has no longer any connection with the works described, and\r\nfor the recent experience of their working he is indebted to Mr.\r\nJohn Newhouse, the superintendent of the sanitary department of the\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe specific volume of the different constituents of green woods has\r\nbeen estimated by M. Hartig to be as follows, per 1,000 parts: Hard\r\ngreen wood, fiber stuff, 441; water, 247; air, 312. Soft green wood,\r\nfiber stuff, 279; water, 317, air, 404. Evergreen wood, fiber stuff,\r\n270; water, 335; air, 395. A certain amount of water--7 or 8 per cent in\r\nall--is included with the fiber stuff, showing that about one-third only\r\nof the mass of the wood is solid stuff; the remainder is either water or\r\nair space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMITAGE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis house is now in course of erection under the superintendence\r\nof Messrs.

The walls are faced in the lower part with red bricks,\r\nand red stone, from the neighborhood of Liverpool, is used for the\r\nwindow-dressings, etc. The upper part of walls will be faced with\r\nred tiles and half-timber work, and the roof will be covered with\r\nStaffordshire tiles. Lead lights will be largely used in the windows.\r\nInternally, the finish will be almost entirely in real woods, including\r\nwalnut for the dining-room and vestibule, pitch-pine for the large hall,\r\nstaircase, and billiard-room, ash for the morning-room, and oak for Mr.\r\nArmitage's own room.

As our readers are aware, we have had an opportunity\r\nof seeing collotype printing in operation in several European\r\nestablishments of note, and have, from time to time, published in these\r\ncolumns our experiences. But requests still come to us so frequently\r\nfor information on the process that we have deemed it well to make a\r\npractical summary for the benefit of those who are working--or desire to\r\nwork--the method.\r\n\r\nThe formulæ and manipulations here set down are those of Löwy, Albert,\r\nAllgeyer, and Obernetter, four of the best authorities on the subject,\r\nand we can assure our readers there is nothing described but what is\r\nactually practiced.\r\n\r\n_Glass Plate for the Printing Block_.--Herr Albert, of Munich, uses\r\npatent plate of nearly half an inch in thickness, as most of his work\r\nis printed upon the Schnell press (machine press). Herr Obernetter, of\r\nVienna, since he only employs the slower and more careful hand\r\npress, prefers plate glass of ordinary thickness as being handier in\r\nmanipulation and better adapted to the common printing-frame.\r\n\r\nHerr Löwy, of Vienna, again, uses plate glass a quarter of an inch\r\nthick, as his productions range from the finest to the roughest.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Coating of the Glass Plate_.--Herr Albert's original plan\r\nwas to apply a preliminary coating of bichromated gelatine to the thick\r\nglass plate, the film being exposed to light through the back of the\r\nglass, and thus rendered insoluble and tightly cemented to the surface;\r\nthis film serving as a basis for the second sensitive coating, that\r\nwas afterward impressed by the negative. This double treatment is now\r\ndefinitely abandoned in most Lichtdruck establishments, and, instead, a\r\npreliminary coating of soluble silicate and albumen dissolved in water\r\nis used.\r\n\r\nHerr Löwy's method and formula are as follows: The glass plate is\r\ncleaned, and coated with--\r\n\r\n    Soluble glass.             3 parts.\r\n    White of egg.              7 \"\r\n    Water.               9 to 10 \"\r\n\r\nThe soluble glass must be free from caustic potash. The mixture, which\r\nmust be used fresh, is carefully filtered, and spread evenly over the\r\npreviously cleaned glass plate. The superfluous liquid is flowed off,\r\nand the film dried either spontaneously or by slightly warming. The film\r\nis generally dry in a few minutes, when it is rinsed with water, and\r\nagain dried; at this stage the plate bears an open, porous film,\r\nslightly opalescent--so slight, however, as only to be observed by an\r\nexperienced eye.\r\n\r\n_Application of the Sensitive Film_.--We now come to the second stage of\r\nthe process, the application of a film of bichromated gelatine to the\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nHerr Löwy's formula is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Bichromate of potash.             16  grammes.\r\n    Gelatine.                          2½ ounces.\r\n    Water.                      20 to 22    \"\r\n\r\nAccording to the weather, the amount of water must be varied; but in any\r\ncase the solution is a very fluid one. An ounce is about 35 grammes, as\r\nmost of our readers know. A practical collotypist sees at a glance the\r\nquality of the prepared plate, without any preliminary testing. A good\r\npreliminary film is a glass that is transparent, yet slightly dull; the\r\nfilm is so thin, you can scarcely believe it is there. The plate is\r\nslightly warmed upon a slate slab, underneath which is a water bath; it\r\nis then flooded with the above mixture of bichromated gelatine, leaving\r\nonly sufficient to make a very thin film. When coated, the plate is\r\nplaced in the drying chamber.\r\n\r\n_Drying the Sensitive Film_.--Much depends upon the drying. A water\r\nbath with gas burner underneath is used for heating, and a slate slab,\r\nperfectly level, receives the glass plate. The drying chamber is kept at\r\nan even temperature of 50° C.\r\n\r\nThe object to be attained is a fine grain throughout the surface of the\r\ngelatine, and unless this grain is satisfactory the finished printing\r\nblock never will be. If the gelatine film be too thick, then the grain\r\nwill be coarse; or, again, if the temperature in drying be too high,\r\nthere will be no grain at all. The drying is complete in two or three\r\nhours, and should not take longer.\r\n\r\n_The Negative to be Printed from_.--The sensitive film being upon the\r\nsurface of a thick glass plate, it is necessary that the cliché or\r\nnegative employed should be upon patent plate, or not upon glass at all,\r\nso as to insure perfect contact. Best of all, is to employ a stripped\r\nnegative, in which case absolute contact is insured in printing. It is\r\nonly in these circumstances that the most perfect impression can be\r\nsecured. If the negative is otherwise satisfactory, and only requires\r\nstripping, it must be upon a leveling stand, and fluid gelatine of a\r\ntolerable consistence is poured over it. When dry, a pen-knife is run\r\naround the margin, and the film leaves the glass without any trouble.\r\n\r\nHerr Obernetter says that many of the negatives he receives have to be\r\nreproduced before they can be transformed into Lichtdruck plates, and\r\nhe employs either the wet collodion process or the graphite method,\r\naccording to circumstances. If the copy is desired to be softer than the\r\noriginal, collodion is employed; if vigor be desired, graphite is used,\r\nand here is his formula:\r\n\r\n    Dextrine.                        62    grains.\r\n    Ordinary white sugar.            77       \"\r\n    Bichromate of ammonia.           30.8     \"\r\n    Water.                            3.21 ounces.\r\n    Glycerine.                   2 to 8    drops.\r\n\r\nThe film is dried at a temperature of 130° to 140° F. in about ten\r\nminutes, and while still warm is printed under a negative in diffused\r\nlight for a period of five to fifteen minutes. In a well-timed print\r\nthe image is slightly visible; the plate is again warmed a little above\r\natmospheric temperature in a darkened room, and then fine levigated\r\ngraphite is applied with a fine dusting brush, a sheet of white paper\r\nbeing held underneath to judge of the effect. Breathing upon the film\r\nrenders it more capable of attracting the powder. When the desired vigor\r\nhas been attained, the superfluous powder is dusted off, and the plate\r\ncoated with normal collodion. Afterward the film is cut through at the\r\nmargins of the plate by means of a sharp knife, and put into water. In a\r\nlittle while--from two to five minutes--the collodion, with the image,\r\nwill be detached from the glass; the film is at once turned over in the\r\nwater, and brought out upon the glass plate. Under a soft jet of water\r\nany air-bubbles that may exist between the collodion and the glass are\r\nremoved, and then a solution of gum arabic (two grammes of gum dissolved\r\nin one hundred grammes of water) is poured over, and the film is allowed\r\nto dry spontaneously.\r\n\r\n_Exposure of the Printing Block under the Negative_.--The exposure\r\nis very rapid. Any one conversant with photolithographic work will\r\nunderstand this. At any rate, every photographer knows that bichromated\r\ngelatine is much more rapid than the chloride of silver he generally has\r\nto do with.\r\n\r\nThere is no other way of measuring the exposure than by the photometer\r\nor personal experience, and the latter is by far the best.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the printing frame, the plate is immersed in cold water.\r\nHere it remains at discretion for half an hour, or an hour; the purpose,\r\nof course, being to wash out the soluble bichromate. It is when the\r\nprint comes out of this bath that judgment is passed upon it. An\r\nexperienced eye tells at once what it is fit for. If it is yellow, the\r\nyellowness must be of the slightest; indeed, Herr Furkl (the manager of\r\nHerr Löwy's Lichtdruck department) will not admit that a good plate is\r\nyellow at all. A yellow tint means that it will take up too much ink\r\nwhen the roller is passed over it. The plates of Herr Obernetter,\r\nhowever, are rather more yellow than Herr Löwy's--certainly only a\r\ntinge, but still yellow; and Herr Obernetter's work proves, at any rate,\r\nthat the yellowish tinge is by no means inseparable from good results.\r\n\r\nThe washed and dried plate should appear like a design of ground and\r\npolished glass. The ground glass appearance is given by the grain. If\r\nthere are pure high-lights (almost transparent) and opalescent shadows,\r\nthe plate is a good one.\r\n\r\n_Printing from the Block_.--We have now a printing-block ready for the\r\npress. If it is to be printed by machinery--that is to say, upon a\r\nSchnell press--the surface is etched; if it has to be more carefully\r\nhandled in a hand press, etching is rarely resorted to; it is moistened\r\nonly with glycerine and water. To etch a plate for a Schnell press, it\r\nis placed upon a leveling stand, and the following solution is poured\r\nupon it:\r\n\r\n    Glycerine............................. 150 parts.\r\n    Ammonia................................ 50   \"\r\n    Nitrate of potash (saltpeter)..........  5   \"\r\n    Water.................................. 25   \"\r\n\r\nAnother equally good formula, recommended by Allgeyer, who managed Herr\r\nAlbert's Lichtdruck printing for some years, is:\r\n\r\n    Glycerine............................. 500 parts.\r\n    Water................................. 500   \"\r\n    Chloride of sodium (common salt)......  15   \"\r\n\r\nIn lieu of common salt, 15 parts of hyposulphite of soda, or other\r\nhygroscopic salt, such as chloride of calcium, may be employed.\r\n\r\nThe etching fluid is permitted to remain upon the image for half an\r\nhour. During this time, by gently moving the finger to and fro over the\r\nsurface, the swelling or relief of the image can be distinctly felt. The\r\nplate is not washed, but the etching fluid simply poured off, so that\r\nthe film remains impregnated with the glycerine and water; at the most,\r\na piece of bibulous paper is used to absorb any superfluous quantity of\r\nthe etching fluid. After etching, the plate is taken straight to the\r\nprinting press. The inking up and printing are done very much as\r\nin lithography. If it requires a practiced hand to produce a good\r\nlithographic print, it stands to reason that in dealing with a gelatine\r\nprinting block, instead of a stone, skill and practice are more\r\nnecessary still. Therefore at this point the photographer should hand\r\nover the work to the lithographer, or rather the Lichtdruck printer.\r\nIt is only by coaxing judiciously, with roller and sponge, that a good\r\nprinting block can be obtained, and no amount of teaching theoretically\r\ncan beget a good printer. To appreciate how skillful a printer must be,\r\nit is only necessary to see the imperfect proofs that first result, and\r\nto watch how these are gradually improved by dint of rolling, rubbing,\r\netching, cleaning, etc. In all Lichldruck establishments, two kinds of\r\nrollers are used, viz., of leather and glue. In some establishments,\r\ntoo, they employ two kinds of ink; but Herr Löwy manages to secure\r\ndelicacy and vigor at the same time by using one ink, but rolling up\r\nwith two kinds of roller.\r\n\r\nCollotype printing is not merely done by hand presses, but is also\r\ndone by machinery. At Herr Albert's a gas engine of six-horse power is\r\nemployed to drive the machines, and each machine requires the\r\nattention of a skilled mechanic and a girl. The press is very like the\r\nlithographic quick press. Upon a big steel bed lies the little collotype\r\nblock. The glass printing block, with its brownish film of gelatine,\r\nmoves horizontally to and fro, and, as it does so, passes under half a\r\ndozen rollers, which not only supply ink, but disperse it. Some of the\r\nrollers are of leather and others of glue, and, whenever the printing\r\nblock retires from underneath them, an ink slab takes the place of the\r\nblock, and imparts more ink to the rollers; sometimes as many as eight\r\nrollers are used, for the difficulty of machine printing is to apply the\r\nink as delicately and equally as possible. It is necessary at intervals\r\nto damp the block, and when the printer in charge finds this to be the\r\ncase, he stops the press, and applies a little glycerine and water\r\nwith a cloth or sponge; then a leather roller is passed over to remove\r\nsuperfluous moisture, and the press is again started.\r\n\r\nHerr Obernetter relies upon the Star or Stern press--a small\r\nlithographic press--one man sufficing to manage it, who turns a wheel\r\nwith large spokes, reminding one of the steering wheel of a ship. The\r\nLichtdruck plate, gelatine film upward, is laid upon a sheet of plate\r\nglass by way of a bed, the plate having first been treated with a\r\nsolution of glycerine and water; it is then inked up as previously\r\ndescribed, except that Herr Obernetter uses two kinds of ink--a thick\r\none and a thin--applied by two rollers of glue. In the first place, a\r\nmoist sponge is rubbed over the surface; then a soft roller covered with\r\nwash-leather, and of the appearance of crêpe, is passed over two or\r\nthree times to remove surplus moisture; then a roller charged with thick\r\nink is put on, and then another with thin is applied. It takes fully\r\nfive minutes to sponge and roll up a plate, the rolling being done\r\ngently and firmly. A sheet of paper is now laid upon the plate, the\r\ntympan is lowered, and the scraper adjusted with due pressure; a\r\nrevolution of the wheel completes the printing, the well-known scraping\r\naction of the lithographic press being used in the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--ORDINARY NAPHTHA LIGHTER OF MR. LOISEAU.]\r\n\r\nSome Lichtdruck prints are printed upon thick plate-paper, and are ready\r\nfor binding without further ado, these being for book illustrations.\r\nOther pictures, that are to pass muster among silver photographs, are,\r\non the other hand, printed upon fine thin paper, and then sized by\r\ndipping in a thin solution of gelatine; after drying, they are further\r\ndipped in a solution of shellac and spirit.--_Photo.

At the present epoch\r\nof indifferent matches, to have, instantaneously, a light by pulling\r\na cord, pressing on a button, or turning a cock, is a thing worthy of\r\nbeing taken into serious consideration; and our own personal experience\r\npermits us to assert that, regarded from this point of view, electricity\r\nis capable of daily rendering inappreciable services.\r\n\r\nAccording to the nature of the application that is to be made of them,\r\nthe places in which they are to be put, and the combustible that they\r\nare to inflame, etc., electric lighters vary greatly in form and\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nWe shall limit ourselves here to pointing out the simplest and most\r\npractical of the numerous models of such apparatus that have been\r\nconstructed up to the present time. All those that we shall describe\r\nare based on the incandescence of a platinum wire. A few have been\r\nconstructed based on the induction spark, but they are more complicated\r\nand expensive, and have not entered into practical use. Before\r\ncommencing to describe these apparatus, we shall make a remark in regard\r\nto the piles for working them, and that is that we prefer for this\r\npurpose Leclanché elements with agglomerated plates and a large surface\r\nof zinc. In order to bring about combustion in any given substance, it\r\nis necessary to bring near it an incandescent body raised to a certain\r\ntemperature, which varies with the nature of the said substance, and\r\nwhich is quite low for illuminating gas, higher for petroleum, and a\r\nwhite heat for a wax taper or a candle. We have said that we make use\r\nexclusively of a platinum wire raised momentarily to incandescence by\r\nthe passage of an electric current. The temperature of such wire will\r\ndepend especially upon the intensity of the current traversing it;\r\nand, if this is too great, the platinum (chosen because of its\r\ninoxidizability and its elevated melting point) will rapidly melt;\r\nwhile, if the intensity is too little, the temperature reached by the\r\nwire will itself be too low, and no inflammation will be brought about.\r\nPractice soon indicates a means of obviating these two inconveniences,\r\nand teaches how each apparatus may be placed under such conditions that\r\nthe wire will hardly ever melt, and that the lighting will always be\r\neffected. For the same intensity of current that traverses the wire,\r\nthe temperature of the latter might be made to vary by diminishing or\r\nincreasing its diameter. A very fine wire will attain a red heat through\r\na very weak current, but it would be very brittle, and subject to break\r\nat the least accident. For this reason it becomes necessary to employ\r\nwires a little stronger, and varying generally from one to two-tenths\r\nof a millimeter in diameter. The current then requires to be a little\r\nintenser. The requisite intensity is easily obtained with elements\r\nof large surface, which have a much feebler internal resistance than\r\nporous-cup elements; and since, for a given number of elements, the\r\nintensity of the current decreases in measure as the internal resistance\r\nof the elements increases, it becomes of interest to diminish such\r\ninternal resistance as much as possible. The platinum wires are usually\r\nrolled spirally, with the object in view of concentrating the heat into\r\na small space, in order to raise the temperature of the wire as much as\r\npossible. There is thus need of a less intense current to produce the\r\ninflammation than with a wire simply stretched out. In fact, the same\r\nwire traversed by a current of constant intensity scarcely reaches a\r\n_red_ heat when it is straight, while it attains a _white_ heat when it\r\nis wound spirally, because, in the latter case, the cooling surface is\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--RANQUE'S NEW FORM OF LIGHTER WITH EXTINGUISHER.]\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to the examination of a few practical forms of\r\nelectric lighters.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 1 will be seen quite a convenient spirit or naphtha lighter,\r\nwhich has been devised more especially for the use of smokers. By\r\npushing the lamp toward the wall, the wick is brought into proximity\r\nwith the spiral, and the lamp, acting on a button behind it, closes\r\nthe current. Pressure on the lamp being removed, the latter moves back\r\nslightly, through the pressure of a small spring which thrusts on the\r\nbutton. Owing to this latter simple arrangement, the spiral never comes\r\nin contact with the flame, and may thus last for a long time. Mr.\r\nLoiseau, the proprietor of this apparatus, employs a very fine platinum\r\nwire, flattened into the form of a ribbon, and it takes only the current\r\nfrom a _single element_ to effect the inflammation of the wick. The\r\nsystem is so arranged that any one can easily replace in a moment the\r\nspiral that has accidentally got out of order; and, in order that this\r\nmay be done, the maker has placed the spiral on a small, distinct piece\r\nthat he styles the \"conflagrator.\" The latter consists of two small,\r\nthin tubes of brass, held parallel and firmly by means of a brass\r\ncross-piece. A small bit of paper wound round each tube in front of the\r\ncross-brace insures insulation. The outer extremity of the two tubes\r\nsupports the platinum spiral, which is fixed to them very simply by the\r\naid of two small brass needles of conical form, which pinch the wire\r\nin the tube and hold it in place. There is nothing easier to do than\r\nreplace the wire. All that is necessary is to remove the two little rods\r\nwith a pair of pincers; to make a spiral of suitable length by rolling\r\nthe wire round a pin; and to fix it into the tubes, as we have just\r\nexplained. With two or three extra \"conflagrators\" on hand, there need\r\nnever any trouble occur.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2 we show a new and simple form of Mr. Ranque's lighter, in\r\nwhich an electro-magnet concealed in the base brings the spiral and\r\nthe wick into juxtaposition. The extinguisher, which is balanced by\r\na counterpoise, oscillates about a horizontal axis, and its support\r\ncarries two small pins, against which act successively two notches in a\r\npiece of oval form, fixed on the side of the movable rods.\r\n\r\nIn the position shown in the cut, on the first emission of a current the\r\nupper notch acts so as to depress the extinguisher, but the travel of\r\nthe rods that carry the spiral is so limited that the latter does not\r\nstrike against the extinguisher. On the next emission, the lower notch\r\nacts so as to raise the extinguisher, while the spiral approaches the\r\nwick and lights it. It is well to actuate these extinguishing-lighters,\r\nwhich may be located at a distance, not by a contact button, but by some\r\npulling arrangement, which is always much more easy to find in the dark\r\nwithout much groping about. There might be used for such a purpose the\r\nvery motion of the front door, when opened, for lighting the hall; but\r\nthat would offer the inconvenience of operating likewise in the daytime,\r\nand of thus needlessly using up the pile and the naphtha. In all these\r\nspirit or naphtha lighters it is important that the spiral _shall not\r\ntouch_ the wick, but that it shall be placed a little above and on the\r\nside, in the mixture of air and combustible vapor.\r\n\r\nSeveral apparatus have likewise been devised for lighting gas by\r\nelectricity, and a few of these we shall describe.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of these is Mr. Barbier's lighter for the use of\r\nsmokers, for lighting candles, sealing letters, etc. It consists of a\r\nsmall gas-burner affixed to a round box, seven to eight centimeters in\r\ndiameter, and connected to the gas-pipe by a rubber tube. By maneuvering\r\nthe handle, the cock is opened and an electric contact set up of\r\nsufficient duration to raise to a red heat the spiral, and to light the\r\ngas. It is well in this case, for the sake of economizing in wire, to\r\nutilize the lead gas-pipe as a return wire, especially if the pile is\r\nlocated at some little distance from the lighter. In the arrangement\r\ngenerally in use the key is provided with a special spring, which tends\r\nto cause it to turn in such a way as to assume a vertical position, and\r\nwith a tooth, which, on engaging with a piece moving on a joint, holds\r\nit in a horizontal position as soon as it has been brought thereto. In\r\norder to extinguish the burner, it is only necessary to depress the\r\nlever, and thus allow the key to assume again the vertical position,\r\nthat is to say, the position that closes the aperture through which the\r\ngas flows out. In a new arrangement, the notch, spring, and the lever\r\nare done away with, the cock alone taking the two positions open or\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nAnother very ingenious system is that of Mr. Loiseau, consisting of an\r\nordinary gas-burner (fish-tail, bat's-wing, etc.), carrying at its side\r\na \"conflagrator,\" analogous to that of the spirit-lighter (Fig. 1), but\r\narranged vertically. One of the rods of the \"conflagrator\" is connected\r\nwith the positive of the pile, and the other with the little horizontal\r\nbrass rod which is placed at the bottom of the burner. On turning the\r\ncock so as to open it, a small flow of gas occurs opposite the platinum\r\nspiral, while at the same time a rigid projecting piece affixed to the\r\ncock bears against a small, vertical metallic piece, and brings it in\r\ncontact with the brass rod. The circuit is thus closed for an instant,\r\nthe spiral is raised to a red heat, and lights the gas, and the flame\r\nrises and finally lights the burner. It goes without saying that on\r\ncontinuing the motion the contact is broken, so as not uselessly to\r\nwaste the pile and so as to stop the escape of gas.\r\n\r\nFor gas furnaces, Mr. Loiseau is constructing a _handle-lighter_ which\r\nis connected with the side of the furnace by flexible cords. The contact\r\nbutton is on the sleeve itself, and the spiral is protected against\r\nshocks by a metallic covering which is cleft at the extremity and the\r\npoints bent over at a right angle. All the lighters here described work\r\nwell, and are rendering valuable services. They may be considered as the\r\nnatural and indispensable auxiliaries of electric call bells, and their\r\nuse has most certainly been rendered practical through the Leclanche\r\npile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEILER'S TELEPHONE RECEIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis telephone receiver differs from its predecessors in dispensing with\r\nan armature, the lateral vibration of the electro-magnet itself being\r\nutilized. In previous systems in which an electro-magnet is used, the\r\nsonorous vibrations are due either to the motion of an iron diaphragm\r\nor armature placed close to the poles of the electro-magnet, or to the\r\nexpansion and contraction of the magnet itself. In Theiler's telephone\r\nthe electro-magnet may be of the usual U-shape, and may consist either\r\nof soft iron or of hardened steel permanently magnetized, wound with a\r\nsuitable number of turns of insulated wire. This electro magnet is fixed\r\nin such a manner that the vibration of either one or of both its limbs\r\nis communicated to a diaphragm or diaphragms The patentees also employ\r\ntwo or more electro-magnets in the same circuit, and utilize the\r\nvibration of both magnets in the manner described. By attaching a light\r\ndisk or disks to the vibrating limbs, the diaphragm may be dispensed\r\nwith. Fig. 1 represents one of the telephone receivers provided with two\r\ndiaphragms or sounding boards, connected to the two limbs or cores of\r\nthe U-shaped electro-magnet by short tongues. These tongues are firmly\r\ninserted in the diaphragms and fixed to the magnet, as shown. The poles\r\nof the electro-magnet are brought very close together by being shaped as\r\nshown, and the middle part of the magnet is firmly screwed to the case\r\nof the instrument. The ends of the helix surrounding the magnet cores\r\nmay be attached as usual to two terminals, or soldered to a flexible\r\nconductor communicating with the other parts of the telephone\r\napparatus. When a vibratory current is sent through the helix of the\r\nelectro-magnet, the extremities are rapidly attracted and repelled, and\r\nthis vibratory motion of the magnet cores being communicated to the\r\ndiaphragms or sounding boards, the latter are set in vibration of\r\nvarying amplitude produced by a current of varying strength, as in all\r\nother telephones. Instead of making the electro-magnet of one continuous\r\npiece of iron, as represented in Fig. 1, the patentees find it\r\nmore practicable to make it of the form shown in Fig. 2, where the\r\nelectro-magnet represented consists of two limbs or cores, a sole piece,\r\nand pole extensions, the whole being screwed together, and practically\r\nconstituting one continuous piece of iron carrying the two coils. In\r\nFig. 2 only one of the limbs or cores of the electro-magnet is attached\r\nto the diaphragm, the other limb being held fixed by a screw. Sometimes\r\nthe patentees hinge one of the magnet cores, or both, in the sole piece,\r\nin which case the diaphragms or sounding boards can be made much thicker\r\nthan when the cores are rigidly fixed to the sole piece, because\r\nthe magnetic attraction of the poles has then only to overcome the\r\nresistance of the diaphragm. Instead of using a diaphragm, they\r\nsometimes fix a stem to one of the cores of the electro-magnet, and\r\nmount thereon a light disk of vulcanite, wood, ivory, gutta-percha, or\r\nany other substance which it is capable of vibrating. When using this\r\ntelephone receiver, the disk is pressed to the ear in such a manner\r\nthat its surface covers the aperture of the ear. When these telephone\r\nreceivers are used on a line of some considerable length, the patentees\r\nprefer to magnetize the electro-magnet by a constant current from\r\na local battery, and to effect the variation of this constant\r\nmagnetization inductively and not directly. The electro-magnet is,\r\nthen, not inserted in the line at all, but in the primary circuit of\r\nan induction coil, and connected with a local battery. The line is\r\nconnected to the secondry circuit of the induction coil. This device\r\npossesses the advantage that the electro-magnet can be powerfully\r\nmagnetized with very little battery power, no matter how long the line\r\nmay be, and that steel magnets are entirely dispensed with. It is not\r\nnecessary to have a separate battery for this purpose, as the microphone\r\nbattery may also be used for the telephone receiver. The shape of the\r\nvibrating electro-magnets is immaterial, as they may be made of a\r\nvariety of forms.--_Eng. Mechanic_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.

Its essential part is a sectional solenoid that\r\nI have likewise made an application of in an electric motor which I\r\npresented in July, 1830, to the Societé de Physique. Let us suppose we\r\nsuperpose, one on the other, a hundred flat bobbins of a centimeter\r\nin thickness in such a way as to form a single solenoid one meter in\r\nheight, and that the incoming and outgoing wires of each of them be\r\nconnected with the contiguous bobbins exactly in the same way as they\r\nare in the consecutive sections or a dynamo-electric machine ring.\r\nFinally, let us complete the resemblance by causing each junction of the\r\nwire of one of the bobbins with the wire of its neighbor to end in a\r\nmetallic plate set into an insulating piece containing as many plates as\r\nthere are bobbins, plus one. Over this species of collector, which maybe\r\nrectilinear or wound around a cylinder, let us pass two brushes fixed to\r\nan insulating piece that may be moved by hand. Now, if we place these\r\ntwo brushes at a distance such that the number of the plates of the\r\ncollector included between them be, for example, equal to ten, and we\r\ngive them any degree of displacement whatever, after rendering them\r\ninterdependent, the current entering through one of these brushes and\r\nmaking its exit through the other will always traverse 10 bobbins.\r\nEverything will occur, then, as if we caused the ten-bobbin solenoid to\r\nmove instead of the brushes. This granted, and the brushes being in any\r\nposition whatever, let us send a current into the apparatus, and place\r\ntherein a soft iron cylinder. By virtue of a well known law, such\r\ncylinder will remain suspended in the interior of the solenoid, and its\r\nlongitudinal center will place itself at so much the greater distance\r\nfrom that of the solenoid the more the current increases in intensity.\r\nIt would even fall entirely if the current had not an intensity above a\r\nminimum value dependent upon many elements concerning which we have not\r\nnow to occupy ourselves. We will suppose the current intense enough to\r\nkeep the distance of the two centers much below that which would bring\r\nabout a fall of the cylinder. When such a condition is fulfilled, it is\r\nfound that if we try to remove the iron cylinder from the equilibrium\r\nthat it is in, we must apply a pressure that increases with the amount\r\nof separation, just exactly as if it were suspended from a spring. It\r\nresults from this fact that if we displace the brushes a distance equal\r\nto the thickness of one plate of the collector, the active solenoid will\r\nundergo the same displacement, and its longitudinal center will move\r\naway from that of the iron cylinder, and that the attraction exerted\r\nupon the latter will increase. It will not be able to assume its first\r\nvalue, and equilibrium cannot be re-established unless the cylinder\r\nundergoes a displacement identical with that of the solenoid. Now,\r\nas this latter depends upon the motion communicated to the system\r\nof brushes, we see that, definitively, the cylinder will faithfully\r\nreproduce the motion communicated to the brushes by the hand of\r\nthe operator. This apparatus, then, constitutes a genuine electric\r\nservo-motor in which the current is never interrupted nor modified in\r\nquantity or direction, no more indeed than the magnetization developed\r\nin the soft iron cylinder. Everything takes place as if the iron\r\ncylinder were suspended in a solenoid ten centimeters in length that\r\nwas caused to rise and fall; with the difference that the weight of the\r\ncylinder exerts no action on the hand of the operator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC POWER HAMMER.]\r\n\r\nThese explanations being understood, there remain but few things to be\r\nsaid to cause the operation of the hammer to be thoroughly comprehended.\r\nThe elementary sections constituting the electric cylinder, A B, of the\r\nhammer are 80 in number, and form a total length of one meter. Their\r\ningoing and outcoming wires end in a collector of circular form shown at\r\nF G. The brushes are replaced by two strips, C E and C D, fixed to the\r\ndouble winch, H C I, which is movable around the fixed center, C. They\r\ncan make any angle whatever with each other, so that by trial there\r\nmaybe given the active solenoid the most suitable length. When such\r\nangle has been determined, the angle, E C D, is rendered invariable by\r\nmeans of a set screw, and the apparatus is maneuvered by imparting to\r\nthe double winch, H C I, an alternating circular motion.\r\n\r\nThe iron cylinder weighs 23 kilogrammes; but, when the current has an\r\nintensity of 43 amperes and traverses 15 sections, the stress developed\r\nmay reach 70 kilogrammes; that is to say, three times the weight of the\r\nhammer. So this latter obeys with absolute docility the motions of the\r\noperator's hands, as those who were present at the lecture were enabled\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nI will incidentally add that this power hammer was placed on a circuit\r\nderived from one that served likewise to supply three Hefner-Alteneck\r\nmachines (Siemens D{5} model) and a Gramme machine (Breguet model P.L.).\r\nEach of these machines was making 1,500 revolutions per minute and\r\ndeveloping 25 kilogrammeters per second, measured by means of a\r\nCarpentier brake. All these apparatus were operating with absolute\r\nindependence, and had for generator the double excitation machine that\r\nfigured at the Exhibition of Electricity.\r\n\r\nIn an experiment made since then, I have succeeded in developing in each\r\nof these four machines 50 kilogrammeters per second, whatever was the\r\nnumber of those that were running; and I found it possible to add the\r\nhammer on a derived circuit without notably affecting the operation of\r\nthe receivers.\r\n\r\nIt results from this that with my system of double excitation machine I\r\nhave been enabled to easily run with absolute independence six machines,\r\neach giving a two-third horse-power. The economic performance, e/E,\r\nmoreover, slightly exceeded 0.50.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLIGNAC'S NEW ELECTRIC LAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it becomes a question of practical lighting, it is very certain\r\nthat the best electric lamp will be the one that is most simple and\r\nrequires the fewest mechanical parts. It is to such simplicity that is\r\ndue all the success of the Jablochkoff candle and the Reynier-Werdermann\r\nlamp. Yet, in the former of these lamps, it is to be regretted that the\r\nsomewhat great and variable resistance opposed to the current in its\r\npassage through two carbons that keep diminishing in length, in measure\r\nas they burn, proves a cause of loss of light and of variation in it.\r\nAnd it is also to be regretted that the duration of combustion of the\r\ncarbons is not longer; and, finally, it is allowable to believe that the\r\npower employed in volatilizing the insulator placed between the carbons\r\nis prejudicial to the economical use of this system. In order to obviate\r\nthis latter inconvenience, an endeavor has been made in the Wilde candle\r\nto do away with the insulator, but the results obtained have scarcely\r\nbeen encouraging. An endeavor has also been made to render the duration\r\nof the carbons greater by employing quite long ones, and causing these\r\nto move forward successively through the intermedium of a species\r\nof rollers, or of counterpoises, as in the lamps of Mersanne and\r\nWerdermann; but then the system becomes more complicated. Finally, in\r\norder to keep the resistance of the carbons at a minimum and constant,\r\ntheir contact with the rheophores of the circuit has been established\r\nat a short distance from the arc, and this is one of the principal\r\nadvantages possessed by the Reynier-Werdermann system. At a certain\r\nepoch it was thought that the problem might be simply solved by\r\narranging in front of each other two carbons actuated by a spiral\r\nspring, as in car lamps, and kept at a proper distance apart for forming\r\nthe electric arc by two funnel-shaped pieces of calcined magnesia, into\r\nwhich they entered like a wedge in measure as their conical point were\r\naway through combustion. This was the system of Mr. De Baillehache,\r\nand the trials that were made therewith were very satisfactory. But,\r\nunfortunately, the magnesia was not able to resist very long the\r\ntemperature to which it was submitted. The problem found a better\r\nsolution in the sun-lamp but has been solved in another manner, and just\r\nas simply, by Mr. Solignac, and the results obtained by him have been\r\nvery satisfactory as regarded from the standpoint of steadiness of the\r\nluminous point.\r\n\r\nIn this system, a general view of which is given in Fig. 1, and the\r\narrangement in Figs. 2 and 3, the carbons, F F, which are horizontal and\r\nabout fifty centimeters in length, are thrust toward each other by\r\ntwo barrels, K, K, which wind up two chains, E, E, passing around the\r\npulleys, D, D, fitted to the extremities of the carbons. These latter\r\nare provided beneath with small glass rods, G, G, whose extremities\r\ntoward the arc abut at a short distance from the latter against a nickel\r\nstop, L (Fig. 3), which supports them, moreover, at M, by means of\r\na tappet whose position is regulated by a screw. The current is\r\ntransmitted to the carbons by two friction rollers, I, I, which serve at\r\nthe same time as a guide for them, and which give the electric flux a\r\npassage of only one or two centimeters over the front of the carbon\r\nto form the arc. Finally, the whole is held by a support, A, and two\r\npieces, CB, CB, which at the same time lead the current to the friction\r\nrollers through projections, J. The two systems are made to approach\r\nor recede from each other, in order to form the arc, by means of a\r\nregulating screw, H.\r\n\r\nAt present, the lighting of these lamps is effected by means of this\r\nscrew, H, but Mr. Solignac is now constructing a model in which the\r\nlighting will be performed automatically by means of a solenoid that\r\nwill react upon a carbon lighter, as in several already well known\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nIf the preceding description has been well-understood, it will be seen\r\nthat the carbons are arrested in their movement toward each other only\r\nby the glass rods, G, abutting against L; but, as the stops, L, are not\r\nfar from the arc, and as the heat to which they are exposed is so much\r\nthe greater in proportion as the incandescent part of the carbons is\r\nnearer them, it results that for a certain elongation of the arc the\r\ntemperature becomes sufficient to soften the glass of the rods, G, G,\r\nso that they bend as shown at O (Fig. 3), and allow the carbons to move\r\nonward until the heat has sufficiently diminished to prevent any further\r\nsoftening of the glass. In measure as the wearing away progresses, the\r\npreceding effects are reproduced; and, as these are produced in an\r\nimperceptible and continuous manner, there is perceived no jumping nor\r\ninconstancy in the light of the arc. Under such conditions, then, the\r\nregulation of the arc is effected under the very influence of the\r\neffect produced; and not under that of an action of a different nature\r\n(electro-magnetism), as happens in other regulators. It is certain that\r\nthis idea is new and original, and the results that we have witnessed\r\nfrom it have been very satisfactory. There is but one regulation to\r\nperform, and that at the beginning, but this once done the apparatus\r\noperates with certainty, and for a long time. With a Meritens machine of\r\nthe first model it has been found possible to light five lamps of this\r\nkind placed in the same circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nAccording to the inventor, this lamp will give a light of 100 carcels\r\nper one horse-power, and with a three horse-power six lamps may be\r\nlighted; but we have made no experiments to ascertain the correctness of\r\nthese figures.\r\n\r\nAs for the cost of the glass rods, that amounts to one franc per\r\ntwo hundred meters length. They can, then, be considered only as an\r\ninsignificant expense in the cost of the carbons. We consequently\r\nbelieve that it will be possible to employ this system advantageously in\r\npractice.--_Th. du Moncel_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDOS'S ELECTRIC LAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the month of May last, the concert at the Champs Elysées has been\r\nlighted by sixteen voltaic arc lamps on a new and very simple system,\r\nwhich gives excellent results in the installation under consideration.\r\nThe sixteen lamps are on the divisible system, and their regulation is\r\nbased upon the principle of derivation. They are supplied by a Siemens\r\nalternating current machine and arranged in four circuits, on each of\r\nwhich are mounted four lamps in series. The accompanying figures will\r\nallow the reader to readily understand the system, which is as simple\r\nas it is ingenious, and which has been combined by Mr. Mondos so as to\r\nobtain a continuous and independent regulation of each lamp.\r\n\r\nIn this system the lower carbon is stationary, the luminous point\r\ndescending in measure as the carbons wear away through combustion. The\r\nupper carbon descends by its own weight, and imperceptibly, so as to\r\nkeep the arc at its normal length.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism that controls the motions of the upper rod that supports\r\nthe carbon-holder consists of two bobbins of fine wire, E (Fig. 2),\r\nmounted on a derived circuit on the terminals of the lamp; of a lever,\r\nL, articulated at O, and supporting a tube, TT', and the whole movable\r\npart balanced by a counterpoise, P. This lever, P, carries two soft iron\r\ncores, F, which enter the bobbins, E, and become magnetized under the\r\ninfluence of the current that passes through them. The upper part of\r\nthe tube, T, carries a square upon which is articulated at O' a second\r\nlever, L', balanced by a second counterpoise, P', and carrying a flat\r\narmature, _p_, opposite the cores, F', that are fixed to the first\r\nhorizontal lever, L. The carbon-holder rod, CC', slides freely in the\r\ntube, TT', and is wedged therein by a small piece, _a m l_, fixed to\r\nthe lever, L'. For this reason the tube, TT', is provided with a notch\r\nopposite the piece _a m l_, and the two arms, _a_ and _m_, of the latter\r\nare shaped like a V, as may be seen in part in the plan in Fig. 2. It is\r\nnow easy to understand how the system operates; when the current is not\r\ntraversing the circuit, the carbons are separated; but, at the moment\r\nthe circuit is closed for lighting a series of lamps, it traverses the\r\nelectro-magnet, which then becomes very powerful, and draws down the\r\ncores, F, along with the lever, L, the tube, TT', and the carbon-holder,\r\nCC', and brings the carbons in contact. The arc then forms, and the\r\ncurrent divides between the arc and the bobbins, E. Its action upon the\r\ncores, F, becomes weak, and it can no longer balance the counterpoise,\r\nP, which falls back, and raises the system again. The arc thus\r\nbecomes _primed_. The cores, F, however, preserve a certain amount of\r\nmagnetization; the armature, _p_, is attracted, and the lever, L',\r\nassumes a position of equilibrium such that the piece, _a m l_, wedges\r\nthe rod, CC', in the tube, TT', and holds it suspended. When, through\r\nwear of the carbons, the arc elongates, a greater portion of the current\r\npasses into the bobbins, E, the armature, _p_, is attracted with more\r\nforce, and the lever, L', swings around the point, O'. The rotation of\r\nL' separates the piece, _a m l_, from the rod, CC', which, being thus\r\nset free, slides by its own weight and shortens the arc. The current\r\nthen becomes weak in E, the armature, _p_, is not so strongly attracted,\r\nthe lever, L', pivots slightly around O' under the action of the weight,\r\nP', and the brake or wedge enters the notch anew, and stops the descent\r\nof the carbon. In practice, the motions that we have just described are\r\nexceedingly slight; the carbon moves imperceptibly, and the length of\r\nthe arc remains invariable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1--MONDOS'S ELECTRIC LAMP.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that the lever, L, and the tube, TT', serve\r\nexclusively for _lighting_, and the lever, L', exclusively for\r\nregulating the distance of the carbons.\r\n\r\nThis lamp exhibits great elasticity, and can operate, without a\r\nchange of any part of its mechanism, with currents of very different\r\nintensities. It suffices for obtaining a proper working of the apparatus\r\nin each case, to regulate the distance from the weight, P', to the point\r\nof suspension, O', and the distance from the armature, _p_, to the\r\ncores, F. At the Champs Elysées concerts the lamps are operating with\r\nalternating currents; but they are capable of operating with continuous\r\nones also, although the slight tremor of the electro-magnetic system,\r\ndue to the use of alternating currents and as a consequence of rapid\r\nchanges of magnetization, seems in principle very favorable to systems\r\nin which the descent of the carbon is based upon friction instead of a\r\nclutch. At the Champs Elysées concerts the lamps burn crayons of 9 to\r\n10 millimeters with a current of 9 to 10 amperes and an effective\r\nelectro-motive power of 60 volts per lamp. The light is very steady,\r\nand the effect produced is most satisfactory. The dispensing with all\r\nclock-work movement and regulating springs makes this electric lamp\r\nof Mr. Mondos a simple and plain apparatus, capable of numerous\r\napplications in the industries, in wide, open spaces, in all cases where\r\nfoci of medium intensity have to be employed, and where it is desired to\r\narrange several lamps in the same circuit.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2--REGULATING MECHANISM.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[AMERICAN POTTERY AND GLASSWARE REPORTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALUMINUM--ITS PROPERTIES, COST, AND USES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAluminum is a shining, white, sonorous metal, having a shade between\r\nsilver and platinum. It is a very light metal, being lighter than glass\r\nand only about one-fourth as heavy as silver of the same bulk. It is\r\nvery malleable and ductile, and is remarkable for its resistance to\r\noxidation, being unaffected by moist or dry air, or by hot or cold\r\nwater. Sulphureted hydrogen gas, which so readily tarnishes silver,\r\nforming a black film on the surface, has no action on this metal.\r\n\r\nNext to silica, the oxide of aluminum (alumina) forms, in combination,\r\nthe most abundant constituent of the crust of the earth (hydrated\r\nsilicate of alumina, clay).\r\n\r\nCommon alum is sulphate of alumina combined with another sulphate, as\r\npotash, soda, etc. It is much used as a mordant in dyeing and calico\r\nprinting, also in tanning.\r\n\r\nAluminum is of great value in mechanical dentistry, as, in addition\r\nto its lightness and strength, it is not affected by the presence of\r\nsulphur in the food--as by eggs, for instance.\r\n\r\nDr. Fowler, of Yarmouthport, Mass., obtained patents for its combination\r\nwith vulcanite as applied to dentistry and other uses. It resists\r\nsulphur in the process of vulcanization in a manner which renders it an\r\nefficient and economical substitute for platinum or gold.\r\n\r\nAluminum is derived from the oxide alumina, which is the principal\r\nconstituent of common clay. Lavoissier, a celebrated French chemist,\r\nfirst suggested the existence of the metallic bases of the earths and\r\nalkalies, which fact was demonstrated twenty years thereafter by\r\nSir Humphry Davy, by eliminating potassium and sodium from their\r\ncombinations; and afterward by the discovery of the metallic bases of\r\nbaryta, strontium, and lime. The earth alumina resisting the action of\r\nthe voltaic pile and the other agents then used to induce decomposition,\r\ntwenty years more passed before the chloride was obtained by Oerstadt,\r\nby subjecting alumina to the action of potassium in a crucible heated\r\nover a spirit lamp. The discovery of aluminum was at last made by Wohler\r\nin 1827, who succeeded in 1846 in obtaining minute globules or beads\r\nof this metal by heating a mixture of chloride of alumina and sodium.\r\nDeville afterward conducted some experiments in obtaining this metal at\r\nthe expense of Napoleon III., who subscribed £1,500, and was rewarded by\r\nthe presentation of two bars of aluminum. The process of manufacture was\r\nafterward so simplified that in 1857 its price at Paris was about two\r\ndollars an ounce. It was at first manufactured from common clay, which\r\ncontains about one-fourth its weight of aluminum, but in 1855 Rose\r\nannounced to the scientific world that it could be obtained from a\r\nmaterial called \"cryolite,\" found in Greenland in large quantities,\r\nimported into Germany under the name of \"mineral soda,\" and used as a\r\nwashing soda and in the manufacture of soap. It consists of a double\r\nfluoride of aluminum, and only requires to be mixed with an excess of\r\nsodium and heated, when the mineral aluminum at once separates. Its cost\r\nof manufacture is given in this estimate for one pound of metal: 16 lb.\r\nof cryolite at 8 cents per pound, $1.28: 2½ lb. metallic sodium at about\r\n26 cents per pound, 70 cents; flux and cost of reduction, $2.02; total,\r\n$4.\r\n\r\nAluminum is used largely in the manufacture of cheap jewelry by making a\r\nhard, gold-colored alloy with copper, called aluminum bronze, consisting\r\nof 90 per cent. of copper and 10 per cent. of aluminum. Like iron, it\r\ndoes not amalgamate directly with mercury, nor is it readily alloyed\r\nwith lead, but many alloys with other metals, as copper, iron, gold,\r\netc., have been made with it and found to be valuable combinations.\r\nOne part of it to 100 parts of gold gives a hard, malleable alloy of\r\na greenish gold color, and an alloy of ¾ iron and ¼ aluminum does not\r\noxidize when exposed to a moist atmosphere. It has also been used to\r\nform a metallic coating upon other metals, as copper, brass, and German\r\nsilver, by the electro-galvanic process. Copper has also been deposited,\r\nby the same process, upon aluminum plates to facilitate their being\r\nrolled very thin; for unless the metal be pure, it requires to be\r\nannealed at each passage through the rolls, and it is found that its\r\nflexibility is greatly increased by rolling. To avoid the bluish white\r\nappearance, like zinc, Dr. Stevenson McAdam recommends immersing the\r\narticle made from aluminum in a heated solution of potash, which will\r\ngive a beautiful white frosted appearance, like that of frosted silver.\r\n\r\nF.W. Gerhard obtained a patent in 1856, in England, for an improved\r\nmeans of obtaining aluminum metal, and the adaptation thereof to the\r\nmanufacture of certain useful articles. Powdered fluoride of aluminum is\r\nplaced alone or in combination with other fluorides in a closed furnace,\r\nheated to a red heat, and exposed to the action of hydrogen gas, which\r\nis used as a reagent in the place of sodium. A reverberating furnace is\r\nused by preference. The fluoride of aluminum is placed in shallow trays\r\nor dishes, each dish being surrounded by clean iron filings placed in\r\nsuitable receptacles; dry hydrogen gas is forced in, and suitable entry\r\nand exit pipes and stop-cocks are provided. The hydrogen gas, combining\r\nwith the fluoride, \"forms hydrofluoric acid, which is taken up by the\r\niron and is thereby converted into fluoride of iron.\" The resulting\r\naluminum \"remains in a metallic state in the bottom of the trays\r\ncontaining the fluoride,\" and may be used for a variety of manufacturing\r\nand ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nThe most important alloy of aluminum is composed of aluminum 10, copper\r\n90. It possesses a pale gold color, a hardness surpassing that of\r\nbronze, and is susceptible of taking a fine polish. This alloy has found\r\na ready market, and, if less costly, would replace red and yellow brass.\r\nIts hardness and tenacity render it peculiarly adapted for journals and\r\nbearings. Its tensile strength is 100,000 lb., and when drawn into wire,\r\n128,000 lb., and its elasticity is one-half that of wrought iron.\r\n\r\nGeneral Morin believes this alloy to be a perfect chemical combination,\r\nas it exhibits, unlike the gun metal, a most complete homogeneousness,\r\nits preparation being also attended by a great development of heat, not\r\nseen in the manufacture of most other alloys. The specific gravity of\r\nthis alloy is 7.7. It is malleable and ductile, may be forged cold as\r\nwell as hot, but is not susceptible of rolling; it may, however, be\r\ndrawn into tubes. It is extremely tough and fibrous.\r\n\r\nAluminum bronze, when exposed to the air, tarnishes less quickly than\r\neither silver, brass, or common bronze, and less, of course, than iron\r\nor steel. The contact of fatty matters or the juice of fruits does not\r\nresult in the production of any soluble metallic salt, an immunity which\r\nhighly recommends it for various articles for table use.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which aluminum bronze is applicable are various. Spoons,\r\nforks, knives, candle-sticks, locks, knobs, door-handles, window\r\nfastenings, harness trimmings, and pistols are made from it; also\r\nobjects of art, such as busts, statuettes, vases, and groups. In France,\r\naluminum bronze is used for the eagles or military standards, for armor,\r\nfor the works of watches, as also watch chains and ornaments. For\r\ncertain parts, such as journals of engines, lathe-head boxes, pinions,\r\nand running gear, it has proved itself superior to all other metals.\r\n\r\nHulot, director of the Imperial postage stamp manufactory in Paris, uses\r\nit in the construction of a punching machine. It is well known that the\r\nbest edges of tempered steel become very generally blunted by paper.\r\nThis is even more the case when the paper is coated with a solution of\r\ngum arabic and then dried, as in the instance of postage stamp sheets.\r\nThe sheets are punched by a machine the upper part of which moves\r\nvertically and is armed with 300 needles of tempered steel, sharpened in\r\na right angle. At every blow of the machine they pass through the\r\nholes in the lower fixed piece, which correspond with the needles, and\r\nperforate five sheets at every blow. Hulot now substitutes this piece by\r\naluminum bronze. Each machine makes daily 120,000 blows, or 180,000,000\r\nperforations, and it has been found that a cushion of the aluminum alloy\r\nwas unaffected after some months' use, while one of brass is useless\r\nafter one day.\r\n\r\nVarious formulæ are given for the production of alloys of aluminum, but\r\nthey are too numerous and intricate to enter into here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF POTASSA IN MANURES.\r\n\r\nBy M.E. DREYFUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method generally adopted for the determination of potassa in\r\nmanures, i. e., the direct incineration of the sample, may in certain\r\ncases occasion considerable errors in consequence of the volatilization\r\nof a portion of the potassium products.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this inconvenience, the author proposes a preliminary treatment\r\nof the manure with sulphuric acid at 1.845 sp. gr., to convert potassium\r\nnitrate and chloride into the fixed sulphate. The sulphuric acid attacks\r\nthe manure energetically, and much facilitates the incineration, which\r\nmay be effected at a dark red heat. The ignited portion (10 grms.) is\r\nexhausted with boiling distilled water acidulated with hydrochloric\r\nacid, and the filtrate, when cold, is made up to 500 c. c. Of this\r\nsolution 50 c c., representing 1 grm. of the sample, are taken, and,\r\nafter being heated until close upon ebullition, baryta-water is added\r\nuntil a strong alkaline reaction is obtained. The sulphuric and\r\nphosphoric acids, alumina, magnesia, etc, are thus precipitated. The\r\nfiltrate is heated to a boil, and mixed with ammonia and ammonium\r\ncarbonate, to precipitate the excess of baryta in solution. The last\r\ntraces of lime are eliminated by means of a few drops of ammonium\r\noxalate. The filtrate is evaporated down on the water-bath, and the\r\nammoniacal salts are expelled by carefully raising the temperature to\r\ndull redness. After having taken up the residue in distilled water it\r\nis treated with platinum chloride, and the potassium chloro-platinate\r\nobtained is reduced with oxalic acid. The quantity of potassa present\r\nin the manure can be calculated from the weight of platinum\r\nobtained.--_Bull. de la Soc.

NEWBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are called the carbon minerals--peat, lignite, coal, graphite,\r\nasphalt, petroleum, etc.--are, properly speaking, not minerals at\r\nall, as they are organic substances, and have no definite chemical\r\ncomposition or crystalline forms. They are, in fact, chiefly the\r\nproducts or phases of a progressive and inevitable change in\r\nplant-tissue, which, like all organic matter, is an unstable compound\r\nand destined to decomposition.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of a mysterious and inscrutable force which resides in the\r\nmicroscopic embryo of the seed, a tree begins its growth. For a brief\r\ninterval, this growth is maintained by the prepared food stored in the\r\ncotyledons, and this suffices to produce and to bring into functional\r\nactivity--some root-fibrils below and leaves above, with which\r\nthe independent and self-sustained life of the individual begins.\r\nHenceforward, perhaps for a thousand years, this life goes on, active in\r\nsummer and dormant in winter, absorbing the sunlight as a motive power\r\nwhich it controls and guides. Its instruments are the discriminating\r\ncells at the extremities of the root-fibrils, which search for, select,\r\nand absorb the crude aliment adapted to the needs of the plant to which\r\nthey belong, and the chlorophyl cells--the lungs and stomach of the\r\ntree--in the leaves. During all the years of the growth of the plant,\r\nthese organs are mainly occupied in breaking the strongly riveted bonds\r\nthat unite oxygen and carbon in carbonic acid; appropriating the carbon\r\nand driving off most of the oxygen. In the end, if the tree is, e. g.,\r\na _Sequoia_, some hundreds of tons of solid, organized tissue have been\r\nraised into a column hundreds of feet in height, in opposition to the\r\nforce of gravitation and to the affinities of inorganic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe time comes, however, sooner or later, when the power which has\r\ncreated and the life that has pervaded this wonderful structure\r\nabandon it. The affinities of inorganic chemistry immediately reassert\r\nthemselves, in ordinary circumstances rapidly tearing down the ephemeral\r\nfabric.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of organic tissue, when deserted by the force which\r\nhas animated and preserved it, gives rise to the phenomena which form\r\nthe theme of this paper.\r\n\r\nMost animal-tissue decomposes with great rapidity, and plant tissue,\r\nwhen not protected, soon decays. This decay is essentially oxidation,\r\nsince its final result is the restoration to the atmosphere of carbonic\r\nacid, which is broken up in plant-growth by the appropriation of its\r\ncarbon. Hence it is a kind of combustion, although this term is more\r\ngenerally applied to very rapid oxidation, with the evolution of\r\nsensible light and heat. But, whether the process goes on rapidly or\r\nslowly, the same force is evolved that is absorbed in the growth of\r\nplant-tissue; and by accelerating and guiding its evolution, we are able\r\nto utilize this force in the production at will of heat, light, and\r\ntheir correlatives, chemical affinity, motive power, electricity, and\r\nmagnetism. The decomposition of plants may, however, be more or less\r\nretarded, and it then takes the form of a destructive distillation,\r\nthe constituents reacting upon each other, and forming temporary\r\ncombinations, part of which are evolved, and part remain behind. Water\r\nis the great extinguisher of this as of the more rapid oxidation that we\r\ncall combustion; and the decomposition of plant-tissue under water is\r\nextremely slow, from the partial exclusion of oxygen. Buried under thick\r\nand nearly impervious masses of clay, where the exclusion of oxygen is\r\nstill more nearly complete, the decomposition is so far retarded that\r\nplant-tissue, which is destroyed by combustion almost instantaneously,\r\nand if exposed to \"the elements\"--moisture with a free access of\r\noxygen--decays in a year or two, may be but partially consumed when\r\nmillions of years have passed. The final result is, however, inevitable,\r\nand always the same, viz., the oxidation and escape of the organic\r\nmutter, and the concentration of the inorganic matter woven into its\r\ncomposition--in it, but not of it--forming what we call the ash of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nSince the decomposition of organic matter commences the instant it is\r\nabandoned by the creative and conservative vital force, and proceeds\r\nuninterruptedly, whether slowly or rapidly, to the final result, it is\r\nevident that each moment in the progress of this decomposition presents\r\nus with a phase of structure and composition different from that which\r\npreceded and from that which follows it. Hence the succession of these\r\nphases forms a complete sliding scale, which is graphically shown in\r\nthe following diagram, where the organic constituents of plant\r\ntissue--carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen--appear gradually\r\ndiminishing to extinction, while the ash remains nearly constant, but\r\nrelatively increasing, till it is the sole representative of the fabric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING THE GENETIC RELATIONS OF THE CARBON\r\nMINERALS.]\r\n\r\nWe may cut this triangle of residual products where we please, and by\r\ncareful analysis determine accurately the chemical composition of a\r\nsection at this point, and we may please ourselves with the illusion, as\r\nmany chemists have done, that the definite proportions found represent\r\nthe formula of a specific compound; but an adjacent section above or\r\nbelow would show a different composition, and so in the entire triangle\r\nwe should find an infinite series of formulae, or rather no constant\r\nformulae at all. We should also find that the slice, taken at any point\r\nwhile lying in the laboratory or undergoing chemical treatment, would\r\nchange in composition, and become a different substance.\r\n\r\nIn the same way we can snatch a brand from the fire at any stage of its\r\ndecomposition, or analyze a decaying tree trunk during any month of its\r\nexistence, and thus manufacture as many chemical formulae as we like,\r\nand give them specific names; but it is evident that this is child's\r\nplay, not science. The truth is, the slowly decomposing tissue of the\r\nplants of past ages has given us a series of phases which we have\r\ngrouped under distinct names, and we have called one group peat, one\r\nlignite, another coal, another anthracite, and another graphite. We have\r\nspaced off the scale, and called all within certain lines by a common\r\nname; but this does not give us a common composition for all the\r\nmaterial within these lines. Hence we see that any effort to define or\r\ndescribe coal, lignite, or anthracite accurately must be a failure,\r\nbecause neither has a fixed composition, neither is a distinct\r\nsubstance, but simply a conventional group of substances which form part\r\nof an infinite and indivisible series.\r\n\r\nBut this sliding scale of solid compounds, which we designate by\r\nthe names given above, is not the only product of the natural and\r\nspontaneous distillation of plant tissue. Part of the original organic\r\nmass remains, though constantly wasting, to represent it; another part\r\nescapes, either completely oxidized as carbonic acid and water, or in\r\na volatile or liquid form, still retaining its organic character, and\r\ndestined to future oxidation, known as carbureted hydrogen, olefiant\r\ngas, petroleum, etc.\r\n\r\nHence, in the decomposition of vegetable tissue, two classes of\r\nresultant compounds are formed, one residual and the other evolved; and\r\nthe genesis and relation of the carbon minerals may be accurately shown\r\nby the following diagram:\r\n\r\n                       PLANT TISSUE\r\n                           _________________\r\n                        |\r\n  _Residual Products_   |   _Evolved Products_\r\n                        |\r\n         Peat.        }\r\n          |           }\r\n       Lignite.       }\r\n          |           }   { Carbonic Acid.\r\n    Bitumious Coal.   }   { Carbonic Oxide.\r\n          |           }   { Carbureted Hydrogen, etc.\r\n Semi-bitumious \"     }   { Water.\r\n          |           }   {         {Maltha.\r\n      Anthracite.     }   {         {  |\r\n          |           }   {         {Asphalt etc.\r\nGraphitie Anthracite. }   { Petro-  {  |\r\n          |           }   { leum    {Asphaltic Coal.\r\n       Graphite.      }             {  |\r\n          |           }             {Asphaltic Anthracite.\r\n         Ash.         }             {  |\r\n                                    {     \"    Graphite.\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--In this diagram, the vertical line connecting the names of the\r\nresidual products (and of the derivatives of petroleum) indicates that\r\neach succeeding one is produced by further alteration from that which\r\nprecedes it, and not independently. Also, the arrangement of the braces\r\nis designed to show that any or all of the evolved products are given\r\noff at each stage of alteration.]\r\n\r\nThe theory here proposed has not been evolved from my inner\r\nconsciousness, but has grown from careful study, through many years, of\r\nfacts in the field. A brief sketch of the evidence in favor of it is all\r\nthat we have space for here.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESIDUAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n_Peat_.--Dry plant-tissue consists of about 50 per cent, of carbon,\r\n44 per cent, of oxygen, with a little nitrogen, and 6 per cent. of\r\nhydrogen. In a peat-bog, we find the upper part of the scale represented\r\nabove very well shown: plants are growing on the surface with the normal\r\ncomposition of cellulose. The first stratum of peat consists of browned\r\nand partially decomposed plant-tissue, which is found to have lost\r\nperhaps 20 per cent. of the components of wood, and to have acquired an\r\nincreasing percentage of carbon. As we descend in the peat, it becomes\r\nmore homogeneous and darker until at the bottom of the marsh ten or\r\ntwenty feet from the surface, we have a black, carbonaceous paste,\r\nwhich, when dried, resembles some varieties of coal, and approaches them\r\nin composition. It has lost half the substance of the original plant,\r\nand shows a marked increase in the relative proportion of carbon.\r\n\r\n_Lignite_.--Each inch in vertical thickness of the peat-bog represents a\r\nphase in the progressive change from wood-tissue to lignite, using\r\nthis term with its common signification to indicate, not necessarily\r\ncarbonized ligneous tissue, but plant-tissue that belongs to a past\r\nthough modern geological age--i.e., Tertiary, Cretaceous, Jurassic, or\r\nTriassic. These lignites or modern coals are only peat beds which have\r\nbeen buried for a longer or shorter time under clay, sand, or solidified\r\nrock, and have progressed farther or less far on the road to coal. As\r\nwith peats, so with lignites, we find that at different geological\r\nlevels they exhibit different stages of this distillation--the Tertiary\r\nlignites being usually distinguished without difficulty by the presence\r\nof a larger quantity of combined water and oxygen, and a less quantity\r\nof carbon, than the Cretaceous coals, and these in turn differ in the\r\nsame respects from the Triassic.\r\n\r\nAll the coals of the Tertiary and Mesozoic ages are grouped under one\r\nname; but it is evident that they are as different from each other as\r\nthe new and spongy from the old and well-rotted peat in the peat-bog.\r\n\r\n_Coal_.--By mere convention, we call the peat which accumulated in the\r\nCarboniferous age by the name of bituminous coal; and an examination\r\nof the Carboniferous strata in different countries has shown that the\r\npeat-beds formed in the Carboniferous age, though varying somewhat, like\r\nothers, with the kind of vegetation from which they were derived, have a\r\ncommon character by which they may be distinguished from the more modern\r\ncoals; containing less water, less oxygen, and more carbon, and usually\r\nexhibiting the property of coking, which is rare in coals of later date.\r\nThough there is great diversity in the Carboniferous coals, and it would\r\nbe absurd to express their composition by a single formula, it may be\r\nsaid that, over the whole world, these coals have characteristics, as\r\na group, by which they can be recognized, the result of the slow\r\ndecomposition of the tissue of plants which lived in the Carboniferous\r\nage, and which have, by a broad and general change, approximated to\r\na certain phase in the spontaneous distillation of plant-tissue. An\r\nexperienced geologist will not fail to refer to their proper horizon\r\na group of coals of Carboniferous age any more than those of the\r\nCretaceous or Tertiary.\r\n\r\n_Anthracite_--In the ages anterior to the Carboniferous, the quantity\r\nof land vegetation was apparently not sufficient to form thick and\r\nextensive beds of peat; but the remains of plant-tissue are contained\r\nin all the older formations, though there only as anthracite or\r\ngraphite--the last two groups of residual products. Of these we have\r\nexamples in the beds of graphite in the Laurentian rocks of Canada,\r\nand of anthracite of the lower Silurian strata of Upper Church and\r\nKilnaleck, Ireland.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it is apparent that the carbon series is graded\r\ngeologically, that is, by the lapse of time during which plant-tissue\r\nhas been subjected to this natural and spontaneous distillation. But we\r\nhave better evidence than this of the derivation of one from another\r\nof the groups of residual products which have been enumerated. In many\r\nlocalities, the coals and lignites of different ages have been exposed\r\nto local influences--such as the outbursts of trap-rock, or the\r\nmetamorphism of mountain chains--which have hastened the distillation,\r\nand out of known earlier groups have produced the last. For example,\r\ntrap outbursts have converted Tertiary lignites in Alaska into good\r\nbituminous coals; on Queen Charlotte's Island, on Anthracite Creek, in\r\nsouthwestern Colorado, and at the Placer Mountains, near Santa Fe,\r\nNew Mexico, Cretaceous lignites into anthracite; those from Queen\r\nCharlotte's Island and southwestern Colorado are as bright, hard, and\r\nvaluable as any from Pennsylvania. At a little distance from the focus\r\nof volcanic action, the Cretaceous coals of southwestern Colorado have\r\nbeen made bituminous and coking, while at the Placer Mountains the same\r\nstratum may be seen in its anthracitic and lignitic stages.\r\n\r\nA still better series, illustrating the derivation of one form of carbon\r\nsolids from another, is furnished by the coals of Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\nand Rhode Island. These are of the same age; in Ohio, presenting the\r\nnormal composition and physical characters of bituminous coals, that\r\nis, of plant tissue generally and uniformly descending the scale in\r\nthe lapse of time from the Carboniferous age to the present. In the\r\nmountains of Pennsylvania the same coal beds, somewhat affected by the\r\nmetamorphism which all the rocks of the Alleghanies have shared, have\r\nreached the stage of _semi-bituminous_ coals, where half the volatile\r\nconstituents have been driven off; again, in the anthracite basins of\r\neastern Pennsylvania, the distillation further effected has formed from\r\nthese coals _anthracite_, containing only from three to ten per cent. of\r\nvolatile matter; while in the focus of metamorphic action, at Newport,\r\nRhode Island, the Carboniferous coals have been changed to _graphitic\r\nanthracite_, that is, are half anthracite and half graphite. Here,\r\ntraveling from west to east, a progressive change is noted, similar to\r\nthat which may be observed in making a vertical section of a peat bog,\r\nor in comparing the coals of Tertiary, Mesozoic, and Carboniferous age,\r\nonly the latter is the continuation and natural sequence of the former\r\nseries of changes.\r\n\r\nIn the Laurentian rocks of Canada are large accumulations of\r\ncarbonaceous matter, all of which is graphite, and that which is\r\nuniversally conceded to be derived from plant-tissue. The oxidation of\r\ngraphite is artificially difficult, and in nature's laboratory slow; but\r\nit is inevitable, as we see in the decomposition of its outcrops and the\r\nblanching of exposed surfaces of clouded marbles, where the coloring is\r\ngraphite. Thus the end is reached, and by observations in the field,\r\nthe origin and relationship of the different carbon solids derived from\r\norganic tissue are demonstrated.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to be said, in regard to them, that all the changes\r\nenumerated may be imitated artificially, and that the stages of\r\ndecomposition which we have designated by the names graphite,\r\nanthracite, coal, lignite, are not necessary results of the\r\ndecomposition of plant-tissue. A fallen tree may slowly consume away,\r\nand all its carbonaceous matter may be oxidized and dissipated without\r\nexhibiting the phases of lignite, coal, etc.; and lignite and coal,\r\nwhen exposed to air and moisture, are burned away to ashes in the same\r\nmanner, simply because in these cases complete oxidation of the carbon\r\ntakes place, particle by particle, and the mass is not affected as a\r\nwhole in such a way as to assume the intermediate stages referred to.\r\nChemical analysis, however, proves that the process is essentially the\r\nsame, although the physical results are different.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLVED PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe gradual wasting of plant-tissue in the formation of peat, lignite,\r\ncoal, etc., may be estimated as averaging for peat, 20 to 30 per cent.;\r\nlignite, 30 to 50 per cent.; coal, 50 to 70 per cent.; anthracite, 70\r\nto 80; and graphite, 90 per cent. of the original mass. The evolved\r\nproducts ultimately represent the entire organic portion of the\r\nwood--the mineral matter, or ash, being the only residuum. These evolved\r\nproducts include both liquids and gases, and by subsequent changes,\r\nsolids are produced from some of them. Carbonic acid, carbonic oxide,\r\nnitrogenous and hydrocarbon gases, water, and petroleum, are mentioned\r\nabove as the substances which escape from wood-tissue during its\r\ndecomposition. That all these are eliminated in the decay of vegetable\r\nand animal structures is now generally conceded by chemists and\r\ngeologists, although there is a wide difference of opinion as to the\r\nnature of the process.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that the evolved products enumerated above are the\r\nresults of the primary decomposition of organic matter, and never of\r\nfurther changes in the residual products; i.e., that in the breaking-up\r\nof organic tissue, variable quantities of coal, anthracite, petroleum,\r\nmarsh gas, etc., are formed, but that these are never derived, the one\r\nfrom the other. This opinion is, however, certainly erroneous, and the\r\nformation of any or all the evolved products may take place throughout\r\nthe entire progress of the decomposition. Marsh gas and carbonic acid\r\nare seen escaping from the surface of pools where recent vegetable\r\nmatter is submerged, and they are also eliminated in the further\r\ndecomposition of peat, lignite, coal, and carbonaceous shale. Fire damp\r\nand choke-damp, common names for the gases mentioned above, are produced\r\nin large quantities in the mines where Tertiary or Cretaceous lignites,\r\nor Carboniferous coals or anthracites are mined. It has been said that\r\nthese gases are simply locked up in the interstices of the carbonaceous\r\nmatter and are liberated in its excavation; but all who have worked coal\r\nmines know that such accumulations are not sufficient to supply the\r\nenormous and continuous flow which comes from all parts of the mass\r\npenetrated. We have ample proof, moreover, that coal, when exposed to\r\nthe air, undergoes a kind of distillation, in which the evolution\r\nof carbonic acid and hydrocarbon gases is a necessary and prominent\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nThe gas makers know that if their coal is permitted to lie for months or\r\nyears after being mined, it suffers serious deterioration, yielding a\r\nless and less quantity of illuminating gas with the lapse of time.\r\nSo coking coals are rendered dry, non-caking, and valueless for this\r\npurpose by long exposure.\r\n\r\nCarbureted hydrogen, olefiant gas, etc., are constant associates of the\r\npetroleum of springs or wells, and this escape of gas and oil has been\r\ngoing on in some localities, without apparent diminution, for two or\r\nthree thousand years. We can only account for the persistence of this\r\nflow by supposing that it is maintained by the gradual distillation of\r\nthe carbonaceous masses with which such evolutions of gas or of liquid\r\nhydro-carbons are always connected. If it were true that carbureted\r\nhydrogen and petroleum are produced only from the primary decomposition\r\nof organic tissue, it would be inevitable that at least the elastic\r\ngases would have escaped long since.\r\n\r\nOil wells which have been nominally exhausted--that is, from which the\r\naccumulations of centuries in rock reservoirs have been pumped--and\r\ntherefore have been abandoned, have in all cases been found to be slowly\r\nreplenished by a current and constant secretion, apparently the product\r\nof an unceasing distillation.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Cumberland, about Burkesville, one of the oil\r\nregions of the country, the gases escaping from the equivalent of the\r\nUtica shale accumulate under the plates of impervious limestone above\r\nuntil masses of rock and earth, hundreds of tons in weight, are\r\nsometimes thrown out with great violence. Unless these gases had been\r\nproduced by comparatively recent distillation, such explosions could not\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nIn opening a coal mine on a hillside, the first traces of the coal seam\r\nare found in a dark stain in the superficial clay; then a substance like\r\nrotten wood is reached, from which all the volatile constituents have\r\nescaped. These appear, however, later, and continue to increase as the\r\nmine is deepened, until under water or a heavy covering of rock the coal\r\nattains its normal physical and chemical characters. Here it is evident\r\nthat the coal has undergone a long-continued distillation, which must\r\nhave resulted in the constant production of carbonic acid and carbureted\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nA line of perennial oil and gas springs marks the outcrop of every\r\ngreat stratum of carbonaceous matter in the country. Of these, the most\r\nconsiderable and remarkable are the bituminous shales of the Silurian\r\n(Utica shale), of the Devonian (Hamilton and Huron shales), the\r\nCarboniferous, etc. Here the carbonaceous constituent (10 to 20 per\r\ncent.) is disseminated through a great proportion of inorganic material,\r\nclay and sand, and seems, both from the nature of the materials which\r\nfurnished it--cellular plants and minute animal organisms--and its\r\ndissemination, to be specially prone to spontaneous distillation. The\r\nUtica shale is the lowest of these great sheets of carbonaceous matter,\r\nand that supplies the hydro-carbon gases and liquids which issue from\r\nthe earth at Collingwood, Canada, and in the valley of the Cumberland.\r\nThe next carbonaceous sheet is formed by the great bituminous shale\r\nbeds of the upper Devonian, which underlie and supply the oil wells in\r\nwestern Pennsylvania. In some places the shale is several hundred\r\nfeet in thickness, and contains more carbonaceous matter than all the\r\noverlying coal strata. The outcrop of this formation, from central New\r\nYork to Tennessee, is conspicuously marked by gas springs, the flow from\r\nwhich is apparently unfailing.\r\n\r\nPetroleum is scarcely less constant in its connection with these\r\ncarbonaceous rocks than carbureted hydrogen, and it only escapes notice\r\nfrom the little space it occupies. The two substances are so closely\r\nallied that they must have a common origin, and they are, in fact,\r\ngenerated simultaneously in thousands of localities.\r\n\r\nDuring the oil excitement of some years since, when the whole country\r\nwas hunted over for \"oil sign,\" in many lagoons, from which bubbles of\r\nmarsh-gas were constantly escaping, films of genuine petroleum were\r\nfound on the surface; and as the underlying strata were barren of oil,\r\nthis could only have been derived from the decaying vegetable tissue\r\nbelow. In the Bay of Marquette, two or three miles north of the town,\r\nwhere the shore is a peat bog underlain by Archæan rocks, I have seen\r\nbubbles of carbureted hydrogen rising in great numbers attended by drops\r\nof petroleum which spread as iridescent films on the surface.\r\n\r\nThe remarks which have been made in regard to the heterogeneous nature\r\nof the solid hydrocarbons apply with scarcely less force to the gaseous\r\nand liquid products of vegetable decomposition. The gases which escape\r\nfrom marshes contain carbonic acid, a number of hydrocarbon gases (or\r\nthe materials out of which they may be composed in the process of\r\nanalysis), and finally a larger or smaller volume of nitrogenous gas.\r\nIt is possible that the elimination of these gases takes the form of\r\nfractional distillation, and definite compounds may be formed directly\r\nfrom the wood-tissue or its derivatives, and mingle as they escape. This\r\nis, however, not certain, for the gases, as we find them, are always\r\nmixtures and never pure. In the liquid evolved products, the petroleums,\r\nthis is emphatically true, for we combine under this name fluids which\r\nvary greatly in both their physical and chemical characters; some are\r\nlight and ethereal, others are thick and tarry; some are transparent,\r\nsome opaque; some red, some brown, others green; some have an offensive\r\nand others an agreeable odor; some contain asphalt in large quantity,\r\nothers paraffine, etc. Thus they form a heterogeneous assemblage of\r\nliquid hydrocarbons, of which naphtha and maltha may be said to form\r\nthe extremes, and which have little in common, except their undefinable\r\nname. The causes of these differences are but imperfectly understood,\r\nbut we know that they are in part dependent on the nature of the organic\r\nmaterial that has furnished the petroleums, and in part upon influences\r\naffecting them after their formation. For example, the oil which\r\nsaturates the Niagara limestone at Chicago, and--which is undoubtedly\r\nindigenous in this rock, and probably of animal origin, is black and\r\nthick; that from Enniskillen, Canada, is also black, has a vile odor,\r\nprobably in virtue of sulphur compounds, and, we have reason to believe,\r\nis derived from animal matter. The oils of northwestern Pennsylvania are\r\nmostly brown, sometimes green by reflected light, and have a pungent and\r\ncharacteristic odor. These are undoubtedly derived from the Hamilton\r\nshales, which contain ten or twenty per cent, of carbonaceous matter,\r\napparently produced from the decomposition of sea-weeds, since these are\r\nin places exceedingly abundant, and nearly all other fossils are absent.\r\n\r\nThe oils of Italy, though varying much in appearance, have usually an\r\nethereal odor that is rather agreeable; they are of Tertiary age. The\r\noils of Japan, differing much among themselves, have as, a common\r\ncharacter an odor quite different from the Pennsylvania oils. So the\r\npetroleums of the Caspian, of India, California, etc., occurring at\r\ndifferent geological horizons, exhibit a diversity of physical and\r\nchemical characters which may be fairly supposed to depend upon the\r\nmaterial from which they have been distilled. The oils in the same\r\nregion, however, are found to exhibit a series of differences which are\r\nplainly the result of causes operating upon them after their production.\r\nNear the surface, they are thicker and darker; below, and near the\r\ncarbonaceous mass from which they have been generated, they are of\r\nlighter gravity and color. We find, in limited quantity, oils which are\r\nnearly white and may be used in lamps without refining--which have been\r\nrefined, in fact, in Nature's laboratory. Others, that are reddish\r\nyellow by transmitted light, sometimes green by reflected light, are\r\ncalled amber oils; these also occur in small quantity, and, as I am led\r\nto believe, have acquired their characteristics by filtration through\r\nmasses of sandstone. Whatever the variety of petroleum may be,\r\nif exposed for a long time to the air it undergoes a spontaneous\r\ndistillation, in which gases and vapors, existing or formed, escape,\r\nand solid residues are left. The nature of these solids varies with\r\nthe petroleums from which they come, some producing asphaltum,\r\nothers paraffine, others ozokerite, and so on through a long list of\r\nsubstances, which have received distinct names as mineral species,\r\nthough rarely, if ever, possessing a definite and invariable\r\ncomposition. The change of petroleum to asphalt may be witnessed at a\r\ngreat number of localities. In Canada, the black asphaltic oil forms by\r\nits evaporation great sheets of hard or tarry asphalt, called gum\r\nbeds, around the oil-springs. In the far West are numerous springs of\r\npetroleum, which are known to the hunters as \"_tar springs_,\" because\r\nof the accumulations about them of the products of the evaporation and\r\noxidation of petroleum to tar or asphalt. Certain less common oils yield\r\nozokerite as a solid, and considerable accumulations of this are known\r\nin Galicia and Utah.\r\n\r\nNatural paraffine is less abundant, and yet in places it occurs in\r\nconsiderable quantity. Asphalt is the common name for the solid residue\r\nfrom the evaporation and oxidation of petroleum; and large accumulations\r\nof this substance are known in many parts of the world, perhaps the most\r\nnoted of all being that of the \"Pitch Lake\". of the Island of Trinidad;\r\nthere, as everywhere else, the derivation of asphalt from petroleum is\r\nobvious, and traceable in all stages. The asphalts, then, have a common\r\nhistory in this, that they are produced by the evaporation and oxidation\r\nof petroleum. But it should also be said that they share the diversity\r\nof character of petroleums, and the term asphalt represents a group of\r\nsubstances of which the physical characters and chemical composition\r\ndiffer greatly in virtue of their derivation, and also differ from\r\nchanges which they are constantly undergoing. Thus at the Pitch Lake in\r\nTrinidad, the central portion is a tarry petroleum, near the sides a\r\nplastic asphalt, and finally that which is of almost rock-like solidity.\r\nHence we see that the solid residues from petroleum are unstable\r\ncompounds like the coals and lignites, and in virtue of their organic\r\nnature are constantly undergoing a series of changes of which the final\r\nterm is combustion or oxidation. From these facts we might fairly infer\r\nthat asphalts formed in geological ages anterior to the present would\r\nexhibit characters resulting from still further distillation; that they\r\nwould be harder and drier, i.e., containing less volatile ingredients\r\nand more fixed carbon. Such is, in fact, the case; and these older\r\nasphalts are represented by _Grahamite, Albertite_, etc., which I have\r\ndesignated as asphaltic coals. These are found in fissures and cavities\r\nin rocks of various ages, which have been more or less disturbed, and\r\nusually in regions where springs of petroleum now exist. The Albertite\r\nfills fissures in Carboniferous rocks in New Brunswick, on a line of\r\ndisturbance and near oil-springs. Precisely the same may be said of the\r\nGrahamite of West Virginia. It fills a vertical fissure, which was\r\ncut through the sandstones and shales of the coal-measures; in the\r\nsandstones it remained open, in the shales it has been closed by the\r\nyielding of the rock. The Grahamite fills the open fissure in the\r\nsandstone, and was plainly introduced when in a liquid state. In the\r\nvicinity are oil springs, and it is on an axis of disturbance. From\r\nnear Tampico, Mexico, I have received a hydrocarbon solid--essentially\r\nGrahamite, asphalt, and petroleum. These are described as occurring near\r\ntogether, and evidently represent phases of different dates in the same\r\nsubstance. I have collected asphaltic coals, very similar to Grahamite\r\nand Albertite in appearance and chemical composition, in Colorado and\r\nUtah, where they occur with the game associates as at Tampico. I have\r\nfound at Canajoharie, New York, in cavities in the lead-veins which rut\r\nthe Utica shale, a hydrocarbon solid which must have infiltrated into\r\nthese cavities as petroleum, but which, since the remote period when the\r\nfissures were formed, has been distilled until it is now _anthracite_.\r\nSimilar anthracitic asphalt or asphaltic anthracite is common in\r\nthe Calciferous sand-rock in Herkimer County, New York, where it is\r\nassociated with, and often contained in, the beautiful crystals of\r\nquartz for which the locality is famous. Here the same phase of\r\ndistillation is reached as in the coke residuum of the petroleum stills.\r\n\r\nAgain, in some crystalline limestones, detached scales or crystals of\r\n_graphite_ occur, which are undoubtedly the product of the complete\r\ndistillation of liquid hydrocarbons with which the rock was once\r\nimpregnated. The remarkable purity of such graphite is the natural\r\nresult of its mode of formation, and such cases resemble the occurrence\r\nof graphite in cast iron and basalt. The black clouds and bands which\r\nstain many otherwise white marbles are generally due to specks of\r\ngraphite, the residue of hydrocarbons which once saturated the rock.\r\nSome limestones are quite black from the carbonaceous matter they\r\ncontain (Lycoming Valley, Pa., Glenn's Falls, N. Y., and Collingwood,\r\nCanada), and these are sold as black marbles, but if exposed to heat,\r\nsuch limestones are blanched by the expulsion of the contained carbon;\r\nusually a residue of anthracite or graphite is left, forming dark spots\r\nor streaks, as we find in the clouded and banded marbles.\r\n\r\nFinally, the great work going on in Nature's laboratory may be closely\r\nimitated by art; the differences in the results being simply the\r\nconsequence of differing conditions in the experiments. Vegetable tissue\r\nhas been converted artificially into the equivalents of lignite, coal,\r\nanthracite, and graphite, with the emission of vapors, gases, and oils\r\nclosely resembling those evolved in natural processes. So petroleum may\r\nbe distilled to form asphalt, and this in turn converted into Albertite\r\nand coke (i.e., anthracite). Grahamite has been artificially produced\r\nfrom petroleum by Mr. W. P. Jenney.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding remarks, no effort has been made even to enumerate\r\nall the so-called carbon minerals which have been described. This was\r\nunnecessary in a discussion of the relations of the more important\r\ngroups, and would have extended this article much beyond its prescribed\r\nlength. Those who care to gain a fuller knowledge of the different\r\nmembers of the various groups are referred to the admirable chapter on\r\nthe \"Hydrocarbon Compounds\" in Dana's Mineralogy.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, add to the value of this paper, if brief mention be\r\nmade of a few carbon minerals of which the genesis and relations are not\r\ngenerally known, and in regard to which special interest is felt, such\r\nas the diamond, jet, the hydrocarbon jellies, \"Dopplerite,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is found in the _débris_ of metamorphic rocks in many\r\ncountries, and is probably one of the evolved products of the\r\ndistillation of organic matter they once contained. Under peculiar\r\ncircumstances it has apparently been formed by precipitation from\r\nsulphide of carbon or some other volatile carbon compound by elective\r\naffinity. Laboratory experiments have proved the possibility of\r\nproducing it by such a process, but the artificial crystals are\r\nmicroscopic, perhaps only because a long time is required to build up\r\nthose of larger size.\r\n\r\nJet is a carbonaceous solid which in most cases is a true lignite, and\r\ngenerally retains more or less of the structure of wood. Masses are\r\nsometimes found that show no structure, and these are probably formed\r\nfrom bitumen which has separated from the wood of which it once formed\r\npart, and which it generally saturates or invests. In some cases,\r\nhowever, these masses of jet-like substance are plainly the residuum of\r\nexcrementitious matter voided by fishes or reptiles. These latter are\r\noften found in the Triassic fish-beds of Connecticut and New Jersey, and\r\nin the Cretaceous marls of the latter State.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a quantity of hydrocarbon jelly, recently, in a\r\npeat-bed at Scranton, Pa., has caused some wonder, but similar\r\nsubstances (Dopplerite, etc.) have been met with in the peat-beds of\r\nother countries; and while the history of the formation of this singular\r\ngroup of hydrocarbons is not yet well understood, and offers an\r\ninteresting subject for future research, we have reason to believe that\r\nthese jellies have been of common occurrence among the evolved products\r\nof the decomposition of vegetable tissue in all ages.\r\n\r\nThe fossil resins--often erroneously called gums--amber, kauri, copal,\r\netc., though interestingly related to the hydro-carbons enumerated on\r\nthe preceding pages, form no essential part of the series, and demand\r\nonly the briefest notice here.\r\n\r\n_Amber_ is the resin which exuded from certain coniferous trees that,\r\nin Tertiary times, grew abundantly in northern Europe. The leaves and\r\ntrunks of these trees have generally perished; but masses of their\r\nresin, more enduring, buried in the earth on the shores of the Baltic,\r\nhave in the lapse of time changed physically and chemically, and have\r\nbecome fitted for the ornamental purposes for which they have been used\r\nby all civilized nations.\r\n\r\n_Kauri_ is the resin of _Dammara australis_, a living coniferous tree of\r\nNew Zealand, and the \"gum\" is dug from the earth on the sites of forests\r\nwhich have now disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Copal_ is a commercial name given to the resins of several different\r\ntrees, but the most esteemed, and indeed the only true copal, is the\r\nproduct of _Trachylobium Mozambicense_, a tree which grows along the\r\nZanzibar coast, and has left its resin buried in the sands of old raised\r\nbeaches which it has abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of character which the fossil resins exhibit shows the\r\ncomplexity of the vital processes in operation in the vegetable kingdom,\r\nand gives probability to the theory that some of the differences we find\r\nin the carbon minerals are due to differences in the plants from which\r\nthey have been derived.\r\n\r\nThe variations in the physical and chemical characters of different\r\ncoals from the same basin, and from different parts of the same stratum,\r\nhave been sometimes credited to the same cause; but they are probably\r\nin greater degree due to the differences in the conditions under which\r\nthese varieties have been formed.\r\n\r\nCannel coal, as I have shown elsewhere (_Amer. Jour. Science_, March,\r\n1857), is completely macerated vegetable tissue which was deposited as\r\ncarbonaceous mud at the bottom of lagoons in the coal-marshes.\r\n\r\nCaking coals were probably peat, which accumulated under somewhat\r\nuniform conditions, was constantly saturated with moisture, and became\r\na comparatively homogeneous and partially gelatinous carbonaceous mass;\r\nwhile the open-burning coals which show a distinctly laminated structure\r\nand consist of layers of pitch-coal, alternating with bands of mineral\r\ncharcoal or cannel, seem to have been formed in alternating conditions,\r\nof more or less moisture, and the bituminous portions are inclosed in\r\ncells or are separated by partitions, so that the mass does not melt\r\ndown, but more or less perfectly holds its form when exposed to heat.\r\n\r\nThe generalities of the origin and relations of the carbon minerals\r\nhave now been briefly considered; but a review of the subject would\r\nbe incomplete without some reference to the theories which have been\r\nadvanced by others, that are in conflict with the views now presented.\r\nThere have always been some who denied the organic nature of the mineral\r\nhydrocarbons, but it has been regarded as a sufficient answer to their\r\ntheories, that chemists and geologists are generally agreed in saying\r\nthat no instances are known of the occurrence in nature of hydrocarbons,\r\nsolid, liquid, or gaseous, in which the evidence was not satisfactory\r\nthat they had been derived from animal or vegetable tissue. A few\r\nexceptional cases, however, in which chemists and geologists of deserved\r\ndistinction have claimed the possibility and even probability of the\r\nproduction of marsh gas, petroleum, etc., through inorganic agencies,\r\nrequire notice.\r\n\r\nIn a paper published in the _Annales de Chimie et de Physique_, Vol.\r\nIX., p.481, M. Berthelot attempts to show that the formation of\r\npetroleum and carbureted hydrogen from inorganic substances is possible,\r\nif it be true, as suggested by Daubre, that there are vast masses of the\r\nalkaline metals--potassium, sodium, etc.--deeply buried in the earth,\r\nand at a high temperature, to which carbonic acid should gain access;\r\nand he demonstrates that, these premises being granted, the formation of\r\nhydrocarbons would necessarily follow.\r\n\r\nBut it should be said that no satisfactory evidence has ever been\r\noffered of the existence of zones or masses of the unoxidized alkaline\r\nmetals in the earth, and it is not claimed by Berthelot that there are\r\nany facts in the occurrence of petroleum and carbureted hydrogen in\r\nnature which seem to exemplify the chemical action which he simply\r\nclaims is theoretically possible. Berthelot also says that, in most\r\ncases, there can be no doubt of the organic origin of the hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nMendeleeff, in the _Revue Scientifique_, 1877, p. 409, discusses at\r\nconsiderable length the genesis of petroleum, and attempts to sustain\r\nthe view that it is of inorganic origin. His arguments and illustrations\r\nare chiefly drawn from the oil wells of Pennsylvania and Canada, and\r\nfor the petroleum of these two districts he claims an inorganic origin,\r\nbecause, as he says, there are no accumulations of organic matter below\r\nthe horizons at which the oils and gases occur. He then goes into a\r\nlengthy discussion of the possible and probable source of petroleum,\r\nwhere, as in the instances cited, an organic origin \"is not possible.\"\r\nIt is a sufficient answer to M. Mendeleeff to say, that beneath the oil\r\nbearing strata of western Pennsylvania are sheets of bituminous shale,\r\nfrom one hundred to five hundred feet in thickness, which afford an\r\nadequate, and it may be proved the true source, of the petroleum, and\r\nthat no petroleum has been found below these shales; also that the\r\noil-fields of Canada are all underlain by the Collingwood shales, the\r\nequivalent of the Utica carbonaceous shales of New York, and that from\r\nthe out-crops of these shales petroleum and hydrocarbon gases are\r\nconstantly escaping. With a better knowledge of the geology of the\r\ndistricts he refers to, he would have seen that the facts in the\r\ncases he cites afford the strongest evidence of the organic origin of\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\nAmong those who are agreed as to the organic origin of the hydrocarbons,\r\nthere is yet some diversity of opinion in regard to the nature of the\r\nprocess by which they have been produced.\r\n\r\nProf. J. P. Lesley has at various times advocated the theory that\r\npetroleum is indigenous in the sand-rocks which hold it, and has been\r\nderived from plants buried in them. (\"Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc.,\" Vol.\r\nX., pp. 33, 187, etc.)\r\n\r\nMy own observations do not sanction this view, as the limited number of\r\nplants buried in the sandstones which are now reservoirs of petroleum\r\nmust always have borne a small proportion in volume to the mass of\r\ninorganic matter; and some of those which are saturated with petroleum\r\nare almost completely destitute of the impressions of plants.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where sandstones contain petroleum in quantity, I think it\r\nwill be found that there are sheets of carbonaceous matter below, from\r\nwhich carbureted hydrogen and petroleum are constantly issuing. A more\r\nprobable explanation of the occurrence of petrolem in the sandstones is\r\nthat they have, from their porosity, become convenient receptacles for\r\nthat which flowed from some organic stratum below.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Sterry Hunt has regarded limestones, and especially the Niagara\r\nand corniferous, as the principal sources of our petroleum; but, as I\r\nhave elsewhere suggested, no considerable flow of petroleum has ever\r\nbeen obtained from the Niagara limestone, though at Chicago and Niagara\r\nFalls it contains a large quantity of bituminous matter; also, that the\r\ncorniferous limestone which Dr. Hunt has regarded as the source of the\r\noil of Canada and Pennsylvania is too thin, and too barren of petroleum,\r\nor the material out of which it is made, to justify the inference.\r\n\r\nThe corniferous limestone is never more than fifty or sixty feet thick,\r\nand does not contain even one per cent. of hydrocarbons; and in southern\r\nKentucky, where oil is produced in large quantity, this limestone does\r\nnot exist.\r\n\r\nThat many limestones are more or less charged with petroleum is well\r\nknown; and in addition to those mentioned above, the Silurian limestone\r\nat Collingwood, Canada, may be cited as an example. As I have elsewhere\r\nshown, we have reason to believe that the petroleum here is indigenous,\r\nand has been derived, in part, at least, from animal organisms; but the\r\nlimestones are generally compact, and if cellular, their cavities are\r\nclosed, and the amount of petroleum which, under any circumstances,\r\nflows from or can be extracted from limestone rock is small. On the\r\nother hand, the bituminous shales which underlie the different oil\r\nregions afford an abundant source of supply, holding the proper\r\nrelations with the reservoirs that contain the oil, and are\r\nspontaneously and constantly evolving gas and oil, as may be observed\r\nin a great number of localities. For this reason, while confessing\r\nthe occurrence of petroleum and asphaltum in many limestones, I am\r\nthoroughly convinced that little or none of the petroleum of commerce is\r\nderived from them.\r\n\r\nProf. S.F. Peckham, who has studied the petroleum field of southern\r\nCalifornia, attributes the abundant hydrocarbon emanations in that\r\nlocality to microscopic animals. It is quite possible that this is\r\ntrue in this and other localities, but the bituminous shales which are\r\nevidently the sources of the petroleum of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky,\r\netc., generally contain abundant impressions of sea weeds, and indeed\r\nthese are almost the only organisms which have left any traces in them.\r\nI am inclined, therefore, now, as in my report on the rock oils of Ohio,\r\npublished in 1860, to ascribe the carbonaceous matter of the bituminous\r\nshales of Pennsylvania and Ohio, and hence the petroleum derived from\r\nthem, to the easily decomposed cellular tissue of algæ which have\r\nin their decomposition contributed a large percentage of diffused\r\ncarbonaceous matter to the sediments accumulating at the bottom of the\r\nwater where they grew. In a recent communication to the National Academy\r\nof Sciences, Dr. T. Sterry Hunt has proposed the theory that anthracite\r\nis the result of the decomposition of vegetable tissue when buried in\r\nporous strata like sandstone; but an examination of even a few of the\r\nimportant deposits of anthracite in the world will show that no such\r\nrelationship as he suggests obtains.\r\n\r\nAnthracite may and does occur in sedimentary rocks of varied character,\r\nbut, so far as my observation has extended, never in quantity in\r\nsandstone. In the Lower Silurian rocks anthracite occurs, both in the\r\nOld World and in the New, where no metamorphism has affected it, and\r\nwhere it is simply the normal result of the long continued distillation\r\nof plant tissue; but the anthracite beds which are known and mined in so\r\nmany countries are the results of the metamorphism of coal-beds of one\r\nor another age, by local outbursts of trap, or the steaming and baking\r\nof the disturbed strata in mountain chains, numerous instances of which\r\nare given on a preceding page.\r\n\r\nM. Mendeleeff, in his article already referred to, misled by a want of\r\nknowledge of the geology of our oil-fields, and ascribing the petroleum\r\nto an inorganic cause, connects the production of oil in Pennsylvania\r\nand Caucasia with the neighboring mountain chains of the Alleghanies and\r\nthe Caucasus; but in these localities a sufficient amount of organic\r\nmatter can be found to supply a source for the petroleum, while the\r\nupheaval and loosening of the strata along lines parallel with the axes\r\nof elevation has favored the decomposition (spontaneous distillation) of\r\nthe carbonaceous strata. It should be distinctly stated, also, that no\r\nigneous rocks are found in the vicinity of productive oil-wells, here or\r\nelsewhere, and there are no facts to sustain the view that petroleum is\r\na volcanic product.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Mississippi, in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky, are\r\ngreat deposits of petroleum, far removed from any mountain chain or\r\nvolcanic vent, and the cases which have been cited of the limited\r\nproduction of hydrocarbons in the vicinity of, and probably in\r\nconnection with, volcanic centers may be explained by supposing that\r\nin these cases the petroleum is distilled from sedimentary strata\r\ncontaining organic matter by the proximity of melted rock, or steam.\r\n\r\nEverything indicates that the distillation which has produced\r\nthe greatest quantities of petroleum known was effected at a low\r\ntemperature, and the constant escape of petroleum and carbureted\r\nhydrogen from the outcrops of bituminous shales, as well as the result\r\nof weathering on the shales, depriving them of all their carbon, shows\r\nthat the distillation and complete elimination of the organic matter\r\nthey contain may take place at the ordinary temperature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATION OF SULPHUR IN IRON AND STEEL.\r\n\r\nBy GEORGE CRAIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor wellnigh two years I have been estimating sulphur in iron and steel\r\nby a modification of the evolution process, which consists in passing\r\nthe evolved gases through an ammoniacal solution of peroxide of\r\nhydrogen, which oxidizes the sulphureted hydrogen to sulphuric acid,\r\nwhich latter is estimated as usual. The _modus operandi_ is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n100 grains of the iron or steel are placed in the 10 oz. flask, a, along\r\nwith ½ oz. water; 1½ oz. hydrochloric acid are added from the stoppered\r\nfunnel, b, in such quantities at a time as to produce a moderate\r\nevolution of gas through the nitrogen bulb, c, which contains 1/8 oz.\r\n(20 vols.) peroxide of hydrogen and ½ oz. ammonia. The tube, d, is to\r\ncondense the bulk of the hydrochloric acid which distills over during\r\nthe operation. When all the acid has been added and the evolution of gas\r\nbecomes sluggish, heat is applied and the liquid boiled till all action\r\nceases. Air is blown through the aparatus for a few minutes and the\r\ncontents of c and d washed into a small beaker and acidified with\r\nhydrochloric acid, boiled, barium chloride added, and the barium\r\nsulphate filtered off after standing a short time. A blank experiment\r\nmust be done with each new lot of peroxide of hydrogen obtained, which\r\nalways gives under 0.1 barium sulphate with me.\r\n\r\nThe whole operation is finished within two hours, the usual oxidation\r\nprocess occupying nearly two days; and the results obtained are\r\ninvariably slightly higher than by the oxidation processes.\r\n\r\nUntil lately I have always added excess of chlorate of potash to the\r\nresidue left in a, evaporated it nearly to dryness, diluted, filtered,\r\nand added chloride of barium to the diluted filtrate, but only once\r\nhave I obtained a trace of precipitate after standing 48 hours, and the\r\npig-iron in that case contained 8 per cent. of silicon, so that all\r\nthe sulphur is evolved during the process. It has been objected to the\r\nevolution process that when the iron contains copper all the sulphur is\r\nnot evolved, but theoretically it ought to be evolved whether copper is\r\npresent or not; and to test the point I fused 3 lb. of ordinary Scotch\r\npig-iron with some copper for half an hour in a Fletcher's gas furnace.\r\nNo copper could be detected in the iron by mere observation with a\r\nmicroscope, but it gave on analysis 0.225 per cent. of copper, and on\r\nestimating the sulphur in it by the above process and by oxidation with\r\nchlorate of potash and hydrochloric acid, using 100 grains in each case,\r\nand performing blank experiments, I found:\r\n\r\n  By peroxide of hydrogen process          0.0357 per cent.\r\n  By oxidation (KClO_{3} and HCl) process, 0.0302     \"\r\n\r\nso that even in highly cupriferous pig-iron all the sulphur is evolved\r\non treatment with strong hydrochloric acid.--_Chem.

F. CHANDLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only about one hundred years since the first important facts were\r\ndiscovered which threw light upon the chemistry of atmosphere. It was in\r\n1774 that Dr. Priestley, in London, and Scheele, in Sweden, discovered\r\nthe vital constituents of the atmosphere--the oxygen gas which supports\r\nlife. The inert gas, nitrogen, had been discovered a year or two before.\r\nWhen we examine our atmosphere, we find it is composed of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen. The nitrogen constitutes no less than 80 per cent, of the\r\natmosphere; the remaining 20 percent, consists of oxygen, so that the\r\natmosphere consists almost entirely of these two gases, odorless and\r\ncolorless and invisible. The atmosphere is, however, never free from\r\nmoisture; a certain amount of aqueous vapor is always present. The\r\nquantity can hardly be stated, as it varies from day to day and month\r\nto month; it depends upon the temperature and other conditions. Then\r\nwe have the gas commonly called carbonic acid in extremely minute\r\nquantities, about one part in 2,500, or four one-hundredths of one per\r\ncent. A small quantity of ammonia and a small quantity of ozone are also\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nBesides these gases which have been enumerated, and which play an\r\nimportant part in supporting life in both the kingdoms of nature, we\r\nfind a great many solids. Every housewife knows how dust settles upon\r\neverything about the house. This dust has recently been the subject of\r\nmost active study, and it proves to be quite as important as the vital\r\noxygen that actually supports life. When we examine this dust--and it\r\nfalls everywhere, not only in the city streets, but upon the tops of\r\nmountains, upon the deck of the ocean steamer, and the Arctic snow--we\r\nfind some of it does not belong to the earth, and, as it is not\r\nterrestrial, we call it cosmical. And when it falls in large pieces we\r\ncall it a meteorite or shooting star. When the Challenger crossed the\r\nAtlantic, and soundings were made in the deep sea, in the mud that was\r\nbrought up and examined there were found various little particles that\r\nwere not terrestrial. They were dust particles that were dropped into\r\nthe atmosphere of the earth from outer space. Then we have terrestrial\r\ndust, and we divide that into mineral and organic. The mineral consists\r\nchiefly of clay, sand, and, near the ocean, salt. Then we have organic\r\nmatter. Some of this is dead leaves which have been ground to powder.\r\nAnimal matter has also become dry and reduced to powder, and we actually\r\nfind the remains of animals and plants floating upon the atmosphere,\r\nespecially in the city. Examinations of the dust which had collected\r\nupon the basement and higher windows of a Fifth avenue residence showed\r\nthat the dust upon the basement floor was chiefly composed of sand.\r\nAnd the higher up I went, the smaller proportion of sand and a larger\r\nproportion of animal matter, so that the dust that blows into our faces\r\nis largely decomposing animal substance.\r\n\r\nBut we have a living matter in the atmosphere. We often notice in the\r\nsummer, after a rain, that the ground is yellow. On gathering up the\r\nyellow powder and examining it under the microscope, we find that it\r\nconsists of pollen. The pollen of rag weed and other plants is supposed\r\nto be the cause of hay fever. But we also have something far more\r\nimportant in the germs of certain classes of vegetation. The effects\r\nare familiar. If food is put away, it becomes mouldy. This mould is a\r\npeculiar kind of vegetation which is called a fungus, and the plants\r\nfungi. In order for this mould to develop a certain temperature and a\r\ncertain degree of moisture are necessary. Our food, we say, decays.\r\nNow, what we call decay is really the growth of these fungi. Animal and\r\nvegetable substances which these fungi seize upon are destroyed. All\r\nordinary fermentations and putrefactions are due to mould fungi, yeast\r\nplants, or bacteria, and liquids undergoing these processes carry these\r\nfungi and their germs wherever they go. The refuse of the city pollutes\r\nthe air. You have only to pass along any street to find more or less\r\nrubbish. That furnishes the nidus for the growth and development of\r\nthese germs, and until we adopt better methods of getting rid of that\r\nrefuse, we never shall have the air of this city in the condition that\r\nit should be.\r\n\r\nOne of the most constant sources of the pollution of the air in\r\ninhabited localities is the decomposition that takes place in the\r\nground. Refuse of every kind gets into it. Our sewers are leaky, and\r\nputrefaction is constantly going on. The soil down to the limit of\r\nthe ground water contains a large amount of air. This air, when the\r\natmospheric pressure in the house is diminished, is drawn in with such\r\norganic impurities as it contains. A cement floor in the cellar is not\r\na protection against this entrance of the ground air, for the cement is\r\nporous to the passage of air, but a remedy may be found by laying on the\r\ncement a covering of coal tar pitch, in which bricks are set on edge,\r\nthe spaces between the bricks are filled with the melted pitch, and the\r\nbricks then covered with coal tar pitch. When the house is building, the\r\nfoundation walls should also be similarly coated, outside as well as\r\ninside. Such a cellar floor was considered to be absolutely impervious\r\nto ground air and moisture. The lecturer had recently laid this floor in\r\nhis own house with the greatest success. The atmosphere of the entire\r\nhouse is improved, and the expense is very moderate. Another source of\r\nthe contamination of the air of houses is the heating apparatus.\r\nStoves and furnaces, however well constructed at first, will, from the\r\ncontraction and expansion of the metal, soon allow the escape of coal\r\ngas, and this danger is greatly increased by the use of dampers in\r\nthe stove-pipe. When, to regulate the fire, the damper in the pipe is\r\nclosed, the gases, having their passage to the chimney cut off, will\r\nescape through any cracks or openings in the stove into the room.\r\nProf. Chandler, having kept a record of accidents from this cause, had\r\naccumulated a formidable list of suffocations due to the use of the\r\ndamper. The danger was now somewhat lessened by providing dampers with\r\nperforations in the center, which allowed the gases to escape when the\r\ndamper was closed. As regards the maintenance of pure air in houses,\r\nthe preference was given to the open fire-place. The hot-air furnace\r\nderiving a supply of pure air from out of doors was, when properly\r\nconstructed, a very satisfactory method of heating, but in city houses\r\nthe mistake was often made of carrying the cold air duct of the furnace\r\nto the front of the house, where it was exposed to the dust of the\r\nstreets. It should be taken from the rear end of the house, and carried\r\nsome distance above the surface of the yard. It was an excellent\r\nexpedient to insert in the cold air duct a wire screen to hold a layer\r\nof cotton to retain the floating impurities which might enter the\r\nair-box. This could be removed from time to time, and the cotton\r\nreplaced. Steam heating has been objected to by many for reasons in\r\nno wise due to the apparatus, but to neglect in the use of it. The\r\ncomplaint of closeness where steam is used is due to the fact that a\r\nroom containing a steam radiator can be heated with every door and\r\nwindow closed, and no fresh air admitted, while with stoves and open\r\nfire-places a certain quantity of fresh air must be admitted to maintain\r\nthe fire. Where radiators are used, the ventilation of the rooms should,\r\ntherefore, be looked after. Again, the complaint that steam apparatus\r\nhas an unpleasant odor is due to the fact that the radiators are allowed\r\nto become covered with dust, which is cooked, and gives rise to the\r\nsmells complained of. The radiator should be from time to time\r\ncleaned. When these precautions are taken, no means of heating is more\r\nsatisfactory than steam.\r\n\r\nSewer gas is another source of contamination; this is a very indefinite\r\nterm, to which formerly many false and exaggerated properties of causing\r\nspecific diseases were attributed. It is now, however, recognized to\r\nmean simply the air of sewers, generally not differing very greatly from\r\ncommon air, containing a certain proportion of marsh gas, carbonic\r\nacid, and sulphureted hydrogen, etc. No one of these gases, however,\r\nis capable of producing the diseases attributed to sewer gas. Careful\r\nresearch has shown that it is the sewage itself, containing germs of\r\nspecific disease, which is added to the air in the sewer by the breaking\r\nof bubbles of gas on its surface, which is the cause of the diseases\r\nassociated with sewers.\r\n\r\nAn intimate connection is believed to exist between the germs of sewer\r\nair and diphtheria, and probably also between sewer air and scarlet\r\nfever. This sewer gas is to be excluded from our houses by proper\r\nsystems of plumbing, and to such an extent have these now been\r\nperfected, that there is no objection to having plumbing fixtures in\r\nall parts of the house. This opinion has lately been objected to in the\r\n_Popular Science Monthly_, as it was at a meeting of the Academy of\r\nMedicine last spring, but on wholly insufficient grounds.\r\n\r\nThe objectors all insist that a trap will allow sewer gas to pass\r\nthrough it, and the experiments made at the Academy of Medicine showed\r\nthat sulphureted hydrogen gas, etc., would so pass. The advocates of the\r\ntrap have never denied that the water seal would absorb gases on one\r\nside and give them off on the other, but they do deny that, in the\r\nconditions existing in good plumbing, such gases will be given off in\r\nquantities to do any damage, and they confidently assert that the germ\r\nwhich is the dangerous element will not pass the seal at all. Pumpelly\r\ninvestigated the matter for the National Board of Health, and in no\r\ninstance was he able to make the germ pass the seal of the trap. It is\r\nnow proposed to set up against the weight of this scientific testimony\r\nthe results of an investigator in Chicago, whose work was at once\r\nappropriated as an advertisement by stock jobbing disinfectant companies\r\nin a manner which raises a suspicion that the investigation was made in\r\ntheir interest. He described tersely the essentials of good plumbing,\r\nthe necessity of a trap on the house drain, the ventilation of the\r\nsoil-pipe, and the ventilation of the trap against siphonage. Of the\r\nfirst, he said that it offered protection to each householder against\r\nthe entrance into his house of the germs of a contagious disease which\r\npassed into the common sewer from the house of a neighbor. Were the trap\r\ndispensed with, the contagion in the sewer would have free entrance into\r\nthe houses connecting with it.\r\n\r\nProf. Chandler, in conclusion, alluded to the cordial relations now\r\nexisting between the Board of Health and the majority of the master\r\nplumbers of the city. He said that for himself his opinion of the craft\r\nhad greatly risen during his intimate connection with plumbers the last\r\ntwo years. He thought the majority of the jobs now done in the city are\r\nwell executed. He believed that the Board of Health had not been obliged\r\nto proceed against more than eight master plumbers since the new law\r\nwent into force. He called upon the Association to adopt a \"code of\r\nethics,\" which should define what an honest plumber can do and cannot\r\ndo, and he illustrated his meaning by citing an extraordinary case of\r\nfraudulent workmanship which had been recently reported to him. His\r\nremarks on this point were greeted with frequent outbursts of applause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTAIN AS A STYPTIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following abstract of a paper read by Dr. Quinlan at the recent\r\nBritish Pharmaceutical Congress, may prove of interest to medical\r\nreaders in this country, where the plant mentioned is a common weed:\r\n\r\n\"About a year ago Dr. Quinlan had seen the chewed leaves of the\r\n_Plantago lanceolata_ successfully used to stop a dangerous hemorrhage\r\nfrom leech bites in a situation where pressure could not be employed. He\r\nhad searched out the literature of the subject, and found that, although\r\nthis herb is highly spoken of by Culpepper and other old writers as\r\na styptic, and alluded to as such in the plays of Shakespeare, its\r\nemployment seems to have died out. Professor Quinlan described the\r\nsuitable varieties of plantain, and exhibited preparations which had\r\nbeen made for him by Dr. J. Evans, of Dublin, State apothecary. They\r\ndried leaves and powdered leaves, conserved with glycerine, for external\r\nuse; the juice preserved by alcohol, as also by glycerine, for internal\r\nuse; and a green extract. He gave an account of the chemistry of the\r\njuice, from which it appeared that it was not a member of the tannin\r\nseries; and also described its physiological effect in causing a\r\ntendency to stasia in the capillaries of the tail of a goldfish,\r\nexamined with a microscopic power of 400 X. He regarded its styptic\r\npower as partly mechanical and partly physiological. The juice, in large\r\ndoses, he had found useful in internal hemorrhages. The knowledge of\r\nthe properties of this plant he thought would be useful in cases of\r\nemergency, because it could be obtained in any field and by the most\r\nuninstructed persons.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacteria, whether significant of disease or decline of health, are found\r\nmore or less numerous in everything we eat and drink. The germs or\r\nspores of many kinds, known as _termo_, _lineola_, tenue, spirillum,\r\nvibriones, etc, exist in almost infinite numbers; some of the smallest\r\nare too small to be seen by the highest powers, which, being lodged in\r\nall vegetable and animal substances, spring into life and develop very\r\nrapidly under favorable circumstances. They develop most rapidly when\r\ndecomposition commences, and seem to indicate the degree or activity\r\nof that decomposition, also hastening the same. They are found most\r\nnumerous in the feces, and usually fully developed in the fresh\r\nevacuations of persons of all ages. They may be seen plainly under\r\na thin glass with high powers with strong or clear light, when the\r\nmaterial is much diluted with water.\r\n\r\nThese bacteria appear almost as numerously, yet more slowly, in urine,\r\neither upon exposure to air or when freshly evacuated, when the general\r\nhealth of the individual is declining, or any tendency to decomposition.\r\nA diagnosis can be aided very greatly by a study of these bacteria,\r\nas they indicate or determine the vitality, vigor, and purity of the\r\nsystem, whether more or less subject to disease, even before any signs\r\nof disease appear. They seem to preindicate the hold of the life force\r\non the material, and always appear when that force is broken. Their\r\nrelative quantity found in feces is as a barometric indication of the\r\ngeneral health or some particular disturbance, and it is surprising\r\nhow very fast they multiply while simply passing the intestines under\r\ncircumstances favorable for their growth. These forms, so small, are\r\nimportant, because so very numerous, and their study has been, perhaps,\r\navoided by many; yet they certainly mean something and effect something,\r\neven the non-malignant varieties as mentioned above, and it is certainly\r\nworth while to continue to study their meaning, even beyond what has\r\nalready been written by others on the subject.--_J.M.

These vary considerably in size, shape, and color,\r\naccording to the variety of the plant which produces them. They are for\r\nthe most part about the size and shape of an ordinary field pea, and,\r\nlike the pea, are of a yellow color; some, however, are of a greenish\r\ntint. These seeds contain a large quantity of oil, which is expressed\r\nfrom them in China and used for a variety of purposes. The residue is\r\nmoulded with a considerable amount of pressure into large circular\r\ncakes, two feet or more across, and six inches or eight inches thick.\r\nThis cake is used either for feeding cattle or for manuring the land;\r\nindeed, a very large trade is done in China with bean cake (as it is\r\nalways called) for these purposes. The well-known sauce called soy is\r\nalso prepared from seeds of this bean. The plant generally known as Soja\r\nhispida is by modern botanists referred to Glycine soja. It is an\r\nerect, hairy, herbaceous plant. The leaves are three-parted and the\r\npapilionaceous flowers are born in axillary racemes. It is too tender\r\nfor outdoor cultivation in this country, but, has been recommended for\r\nextended growth in our colonies as a commercial plant. The plants are\r\nreadily used from seed.--_J.R.F., in The Garden_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOY BEAN. _(Soja Lispida)_]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERICA CAVENDISHIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plant of which the illustration is given is one of those fine\r\nspecimens which has made the collection of J. Lawless, Esq., The\r\nCottage, Exeter, famous all over the south and west of England. It is\r\nonly one specimen among a considerable collection of hard-wooded plants\r\nwhich are cultivated and trained in first rate style by Mr. George Cole,\r\nthe gardener, one of the most successful plant growers of the day. The\r\nplant was in the winning collection of Mr. Cole exhibited at the late\r\nspring show held at Plymouth.--_The Gardeners' Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERICA CAVENDISHIANA.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILESIA BUXIFOLIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe figure this plant, not as a novelty, but for the purpose of showing\r\nwhat a fine thing it is when grown under propitious circumstances.\r\nGenerally, we see it more or less starved in the greenhouse, and even\r\nwhen planted out in the winter garden its flowers lack the size and\r\nrichness of color they attain out-of-doors. It comes from the extreme\r\nsouth of South America, which accounts for its hardihood, and is a near\r\nally of the Lapageria: the latter is remarkable for withstanding even\r\nthe noxious fumes of the copper smelting works in Chili, and as the\r\nPhilesia has similar tough leaves, it is probable that it would support\r\nthe vitiated atmosphere of a town better than most evergreens. In any\r\ncase, there is no reasonable doubt but that, if cultivators would take\r\nthe necessary pains, they might select perfectly hardy varieties both\r\nof the Lapageria and of the Philesia. As it is, we can only call the\r\nPhilesea half-hardy north of the Thames, while the Lapageria is not even\r\nthat. The curious Philageria, raised in Messrs. Veitch's nursery and\r\ndescribed and figured in our columns in 1872, p. 358, is a hybrid raised\r\nbetween the two genera. For the specimen of Philesia figured we are\r\nindebted to Mr. Dartnall.--_The Gardeners' Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILESIA BUXIFOLIA--HARDY SHRUB--FLOWERS, ROSE PINK.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOGANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mahogany tree, says the _Lumber World_, is a native of the West\r\nIndies, the Bahamas, and that portion of Central America that lies\r\nadjacent to the Bay of Honduras, and has also been found in Florida. It\r\nis stated to be of moderately rapid growth, reaching its full maturity\r\nin about two hundred years. Full grown, it is one of the monarchs of\r\ntropical America. Its trunk, which often exceeds forty feet in length\r\nand six in diameter, and massive arms, rising to a lofty height,\r\nand spreading with graceful sweep over immense spaces, covered with\r\nbeautiful foliage, bright, glossy, light, and airy, clinging so long to\r\nthe spray as to make it almost an evergreen, present a rare combination\r\nof loveliness and grandeur. The leaves are small, delicate, and polished\r\nlike those of the laurel. The flowers are small and white, or greenish\r\nyellow. The fruit is a hard, woody capsule, oval, not unlike the head of\r\na turkey in size and shape, and contains five cells, in each of which\r\nare inclosed about fifteen seeds.\r\n\r\nThe mahogany tree was not discovered till the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and was not brought into European use till nearly a century\r\nlater. The first mention of it is that it was used in the repair of\r\nsome of Sir Walter Raleigh's ships, at Trinidad, in 1597. Its finely\r\nvariegated tints were admired, but in that age the dream of El Dorado\r\ncaused matters of more value to be neglected. The first that was brought\r\nto England was about 1724, a few planks having been sent to Dr. Gibbons,\r\nof London, by a brother who was a West Indian captain. The doctor was\r\nerecting a house, and gave the planks to the workmen, who rejected them\r\nas being too hard. The doctor then had a candle-box made of the wood,\r\nhis cabinet-maker also complaining of the hardness of the timber.\r\nBut, when finished, the box became an object of general curiosity and\r\nadmiration. He had one bureau, and her Grace of Buckingham had another,\r\nmade of this beautiful wood, and the despised mahogany now became a\r\nprominent article of luxury, and at the same time raised the fortunes\r\nof the cabinet-maker by whom it had been so little regarded. Since that\r\nlime it has taken a leading rank among the ornamental woods, having come\r\nto be considered indispensable where luxury is intended to be indicated.\r\n\r\nA few facts will furnish a tolerably distinct idea of the size of this\r\nsplendid tree. The mahogany lumbermen, having selected a tree, surround\r\nit with a platform about twelve feet above the ground, and cut it above\r\nthe platform. Some twelve or fifteen feet of the largest part of the\r\ntrunk are thus lost. Yet a single log not unfrequently weighs from six\r\nor seven to fifteen tons, and sometimes measures as much as seventeen\r\nfeet in length and four and a half to five and a half feet in diameter,\r\none tree furnishing two, three, or four such logs. Some trees have\r\nyielded 12,000 superficial feet, and at average price pieces have sold\r\nfor $15,000. Messrs. Broadwood London, pianoforte manufacturers, paid\r\n£3,000 for three logs, all cut from one tree, and each about fifteen\r\nfeet long and more than three feet square. The tree is cut at two\r\nseasons of the year--in the autumn and about Christmas time. The trunk,\r\nof course, furnishes timber of the largest dimensions, but that from the\r\nbranches is preferred for ornamental purposes, owing to its closer grain\r\nand more variegated color.\r\n\r\nIn low and damp soil its growth is rapid; but the most valuable trees\r\ngrow slowly among rocks on sterile soil, and seem to gather compactness\r\nand beauty from the very struggle which they make for an existence.\r\nIn the Bahamas, in the most desolate regions, once flourished that\r\ncuriously veined and much esteemed variety once known in Europe as\r\n\"Madeira wood,\" but which has long since been exterminated. Jamaica,\r\nalso, which used to be a fruitful source of mahogany, and whence in 1753\r\nnot less than 521,000 feet were shipped, is now almost depleted. That\r\nwhich is now furnished from there is very inferior, pale, and porous,\r\nand is less esteemed than that of Cuba, San Domingo, or Honduras.\r\n\r\nIn a dry state mahogany Is very durable, and not liable to the attack of\r\nworms, but, when exposed to the weather it does not last long. It would\r\ntherefore make excellent material for floors, roofs, etc., but its\r\ncostliness limits its utility in this direction, and it is chiefly\r\nemployed for furniture, doors, and a few other articles of joinery, for\r\nwhich it is among the best materials known. It has been used for sashes\r\nand window frames, but is not desirable for this purpose on account of\r\nthe ease with which it is affected by the weather. It has also been used\r\nin England to some extent for the framing of machinery in cotton-mills.\r\nIts color is a reddish brown of different shades and luster, sometimes\r\nbecoming a yellowish brown, and often much veined and mottled with\r\ndarker shades of the same color. Its texture is uniform, and the rings\r\nindicating its annual growth are not very distinct. The larger medullary\r\nrays are absent, but the smaller ones are often very distinct, with\r\npores between them. In the Jamaica woods these pores are often filled\r\nwith a white substance, but in that brought from Central America they\r\nare generally empty. It has neither taste nor odor, shrinks very\r\nslightly, and warps, it is said, less than any other wood.\r\n\r\nThe variety called Spanish mahogany comes from the West Indies, and is\r\nin smaller logs than the Honduras mahogany, being generally about two\r\nfeet square and ten feet long. It is close grained and hard, generally\r\ndarker than the Honduras, free from black specks, and sometimes strongly\r\nmarked; the pores appear as though chalk had been rubbed into them.\r\n\r\nThe Honduras mahogany comes in logs from two to four feet square and\r\ntwelve to fourteen long; planks have been obtained seven feet wide. Its\r\ngrain is very open and often irregular, with black or gray specks. The\r\nveins and figures are often very distinct and handsome, and that of a\r\nfine golden color and free from gray specks is considered the best. It\r\nholds the glue better than any other wood. The weight of a cubic foot of\r\nmahogany varies from thirty-five to fifty-three pounds. Its strength\r\nis between sixty-seven and ninety-six, stiffness seventy-three to\r\nninety-three, and toughness sixty-one to ninety-nine--oak being\r\nconsidered as one hundred in each case.\r\n\r\nThere are three other species of the genus _Swietania_ besides the\r\nmahogany tree, two of them natives of the East Indies. One is a very\r\nlarge tree, growing in the mountainous parts of central Hindostan, and\r\nrises to a great height, throwing out many branches toward the top. The\r\nhead is spreading and the leaves bear some resemblance to those of the\r\nAmerican species. The wood is a dull red, not so beautiful as that known\r\nto commerce, but harder, heavier, and more durable. The natives of India\r\nconsider it the most durable timber which their forests afford, and\r\nconsequently use it, when it can be procured, wherever strength and\r\ndurability are particularly desired. The other East Indian species is\r\nfound in the mountains of Sircars, which run parallel to the Bay of\r\nBengal. The tree is not so large as any of the other species described,\r\nand the wood is of much different appearance, being of a deep yellow,\r\nconsiderably resembling box. The grain is close, and the wood both heavy\r\nand durable. The third species, known as African mahogany, is brought\r\nfrom Sierra Leone. It is hard and durable, and used for purposes\r\nrequiring these properties in an eminent degree. If, however, the heart\r\nof the tree be exposed or crossed in cutting or trimming the timber, it\r\nis very liable to premature and rapid decay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMALS AND THE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many of the museums efforts are made to perfect economic collections\r\nof animals, so as to show how they can be applied to advantage in the\r\narts and sciences. The collection and preparation of the corals, for\r\nexample, form an important industry. The fossil corals are richly\r\npolished and set in studs and sleeve-buttons, forming rich and\r\nornamental objects. The fossil coral that resembles a delicate chain has\r\nbeen often copied by designers, while the red and black corals have long\r\nbeen used. The best fisheries are along the coasts of Tunis, Algeria,\r\nand Morocco, from 2 to 10 miles from shore, in from 30 to 150 fathoms.\r\nGood coral is also common at Naples, near Leghorn and Genoa, and on\r\nvarious parts of the sea, as Sardinia, Corsica, Catalonia, Provence,\r\netc. It ranges in color from pure white through all the shades of\r\npink, red, and crimson. The rose pink is most valued. For a long time\r\nMarseilles was the market, but now Italy is the great center of the\r\ntrade, the greater number of boats hailing from Torre del Greco,\r\nwhile outside persons are forced to pay a heavy tax. The vessels are\r\nschooners, lateen-rigged, from three to fourteen tons. Large nets are\r\nused, which, during the months between March and October, are dragged,\r\ndredge-like, over the rocks. A large crew will haul in a season from 600\r\nto 900 pounds. To prevent the destruction of the industry, the reef is\r\ndivided into ten parts, only one being worked a year, and by the time\r\nthe tenth is reached the first is overgrown again with a new growth. In\r\n1873 the Algerian fisheries alone, employing 3,150 men, realized half a\r\nmillion of dollars. The choice grades are always valuable, the finest\r\ntints bringing over $5 per ounce, while the small pieces, used for\r\nnecklaces, and called collette, are worth only $1.50 per ounce. The\r\nlarge oval pieces are sent to China, where they are used as buttons of\r\noffice by the mandarins.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCH-SHELL.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar in appearance to coral is the conch jewelry, sets of\r\nwhich have been sold for $300. The tint is exquisite, but liable to fade\r\nwhen exposed to the sun. It is made from the great conch, common in\r\nSouthern Florida and the West Indies. The shells are imported into\r\nEurope by thousands, and cut up into studs, sleeve-buttons, and various\r\narticles of ornament. These conches are supposed to be the producers of\r\npink pearls, but I have opened hundreds of them and failed to find a\r\nsingle pearl. The conch shell is used by the cameo cutter. Rome and\r\nParis are the principal seats of the trade, and immense numbers of\r\nshell cameos are imported by England and America, and mounted in rings,\r\nbrooches, etc. The one showing a pale salmon-color upon an orange ground\r\nis much used. In 1847, 300 persons worked upon these shells in Paris\r\nalone, the number of shells used being immense. In Paris 300,000\r\nhelmet-shells were used in one year, valued at $40,000 of the bull's\r\nmouth, 80,000, averaging a little over a shilling apiece, equal to\r\n$34,000. Eight thousand black helmets were used, valued at $9,000. The\r\nvalue of the large cameos produced in Paris in the year 1847 was about\r\n$160,000, and the small ones $40,000. In the Wolfe collection of shells\r\nat the Museum of Natural History, Central Park, is a fine specimen of\r\nthe queen conch from the Florida reef, with a fine head cut into the\r\nouter surface, showing how it is done. The tools of the worker in cameos\r\nare of the most delicate description. Fine files, knitting-needle like\r\nimplements, triangular-shaped steel cutters, are arranged in a seemingly\r\nendless confusion before the worker. The shell or piece of shell to be\r\ncut is either lashed or glued to a heavy block or held in the hand, and\r\nthe face, animal, or other object outlined first with a delicate lead;\r\nhaving thus laid the foundation, the lines are gone over with a delicate\r\nneedle first, then various kinds, the work gradually growing before the\r\neye, reminding one of the work of the engraver on wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVING BEETLES, ETC.\r\n\r\nInsects have always been used more or less in decoration, especially in\r\nBrazil, where the richly-colored beetles of the country are affected as\r\narticles of personal adornment. Recently in a Union Square jewelry store\r\na monster beetle was on exhibition, having been sent there for repairs.\r\nIt was alive, and about its body was a delicate gold band, locked with\r\na minute padlock; a gold chain attached it to the shawl of the owner.\r\nSometimes they are worn upon the headgear, their slow, cumbersome\r\nmovements preventing them from attracting great attention. They are\r\nvalued at from $50 to $100 apiece. Snakes, the rich green variety so\r\ncommon in New England, are worn by some ladies as bracelets, while the\r\ngorgeous reptiles are often imitated in gold and silver, with eyes of\r\ndiamonds, rubies, or black pearls. Gold bears are the proper thing now\r\nfor pins. In the East the chameleon is often worn as a head ornament,\r\nthe animal rarely moving, and forming at least a picturesque decoration,\r\nwith its odd shape and sculptured outlines. Various other reptiles, as\r\nsmall turtles, alligators, etc., are pressed into service. The curious\r\nsoldier-crab has been used as a pin. Placed in a box with a rich pearly\r\nshell prepared for the purpose, it will change houses, and then, secured\r\nby a gold or silver chain, roams about the wearer, waving its red and\r\nblue claws in a warlike manner. Birds are, perhaps, more commonly used\r\nas natural ornaments than any other, and a cloak of the skins of humming\r\nbirds is one of the most magnificent objects to be imagined. One, of a\r\nrare species, was once sold in Europe for $5,000. Single birds are often\r\nworth $700 or $800. A cloak of the skin of the great auk would bring\r\n$8,000 or $10,000. Some of the most beautiful pheasants are extremely\r\nvaluable--worth their weight in gold. Tiger claws are used in the\r\ndecoration of hats, and are extremely valuable and hard to obtain.\r\n\r\nWithin ten years the alligator has become an important factor to the\r\nartistic manufacturer. The hide, by a new process, is tanned to an\r\nagreeable softness and used in innumerable ways. The most costly bags\r\nand trunks are made from it; pocket-books, card-cases, dining-room\r\nchairs are covered with it, and it has been used as a dado on the\r\nlibrary wall of a well-known naturalist. It makes an excellent binding\r\nfor certain books. Among fishes the shark provides a skin used in a\r\nvariety of ways. The shagreen of the shark's ray is of great value.\r\nCanes are made of the shark's backbone, the interstices being filled\r\nwith silver or shell plates. Shark's teeth are used to decorate the\r\nweapons of various nations. The magnificent scales, nearly four inches\r\nacross and tipped with seemingly solid silver, of the giant herring,\r\nare used, while scales of many of the tribe have long been used in the\r\nmanufacture of artificial pearls.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARLS.\r\n\r\nThe latter are perhaps the most valuable of all the offerings of animate\r\nnature, and are the results of the efforts of the bivalve to protect\r\nitself from injury. A parasite bores into the shell of the pearl bearer,\r\nand when felt by the animal it immediately fortifies itself by covering\r\nup the spot with its pearly secretion; the parasite pushes on, the\r\noyster piling up until an imperfect pearl attached to the shell is the\r\nresult. The clear oval pearls are formed in a similar way, only in this\r\ncase a bit of sand has become lodged in the folds of the creature, and\r\nin its efforts to protect itself from the sharp edges, the bit becomes\r\ncovered, layer by layer, and assumes naturally an oval shape. This\r\ngrowth of the pearl, as it is incorrectly termed, can be seen by\r\nbreaking open a $500 gem, when the nacre will be seen in layers,\r\nresembling the section of an onion. The Romans were particularly fond of\r\npearls, and, according to Pliny, the wife of Caius Caligula possessed\r\na collection valued at over $8,000,000 of our money. Julius Caesar\r\npresented a jewel to the mother of Brutus valued at $250,000, while\r\nthe pearl drank by Cleopatra was estimated at $400,000. Tavernier, the\r\nfamous traveler, sold a pearl to the Shah of Persia for $550,000. A\r\ntwenty-thousand-dollar pearl was taken from American waters in the\r\ntime of Philip II. It was pear-shaped, and as large as a pigeon's egg.\r\nAnother, taken from the same locality, is now owned by a lady in Madrid\r\nwho values it at $30,000.\r\n\r\nFresh water pearls are often of great value. The streams of St. Clair\r\nCounty. Ill., and Rutherford County, Tenn., produce large quantities,\r\nbut the largest one was found near Salem, N. J. It was about an inch\r\nacross, and brought $2,000 in Paris. The pearls from the Tay, Doon, and\r\nIsla rivers, in Scotland, are preferred by many to the Oriental, and in\r\none summer $50,000 worth of pearls have been taken from these localities\r\nby men and children. Mother-of-pearl used in the arts is sold by the\r\nton, from $50 to $700 being average prices. The last year's pearl\r\nfisheries in Ceylon alone realized $80,000, to obtain which more than\r\n7,000,000 pearl oysters were brought up.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPIA AND SILK.\r\n\r\nThe sepia of the artist comes from a mollusk, and is the fossil or\r\nextant ink-bag of a cephalopod or squid, while the cuttle-fish bone is\r\nused for a variety of purposes. In the islands of the Pacific the young\r\nof the pearly nautilus are strung upon strings and sold for $25 and $20\r\nas necklaces. The tritons are in fair demand, and many tons of cowries\r\nare sent to Europe yearly, while the shipment of a thick-lipped strombus\r\nin one year to Liverpool amounted to 300,000. The rich coloring of the\r\nhaliotis is used for inlaying art furniture. From the pinna, silk of a\r\npeculiar quality is obtained. It is the byssus or cable of the animal.\r\nThe threads are extremely fine, and equal in diameter throughout their\r\nentire length. It is first cleaned with soap and water, and dried by\r\nrubbing through the hands, and finally passed through combs of bone,\r\niron, or wood, of different sizes, so that a pound of the material in\r\nthe rough gives only about three ounces of pure thread. It is mixed with\r\na third of real silk and spun into gloves, stockings, etc., having a\r\nbeautiful yellow hue. The articles made from it are, however, not in\r\ngeneral use. A pair of gloves from pinna silk would cost $1.50, and\r\nstockings about $3. Fine specimens of such work can be seen in the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\nThough not of animal origin, amber is one of the choicest vegetable\r\nproductions used in the arts. It is the fossil gum of pines. Great beds\r\nof it occur at various points in Europe. On the Prussian seaboard it is\r\nmined, and often washes ashore. In 1576 a piece of amber was found\r\nthat weighed thirteen pounds, and for which $5,000 was refused. In the\r\ncabinet of the Berlin Museum there is a piece weighing eighteen pounds.\r\nAmbergris, from which perfumery is made, is a secretion taken from the\r\nintestines of the whale, and a piece purchased from the King of Tydore\r\nby the East India Company is reported to have cost $18,000. Whales'\r\nteeth, the tusks of elephants, and those of the walrus and narwhal, are\r\nall used. Elephants' feet are cut off at a convenient length, richly\r\nupholstered, and used as seats; the great toe-nails, when finely\r\npolished, giving the novel article of furniture an attractive and unique\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nIt is probably not generally known that the web of certain spiders has\r\nbeen used. Over 150 years ago, Le Bon, of France, succeeded in weaving\r\nthe web material into delicate gloves. Prof. B.G. Wilder investigated\r\nthe question thoroughly, and was a firm believer that the web of the\r\nspider had a commercial value, but as yet this has not been realized.\r\nIt would be difficult to find an animal that does not in some way\r\ncontribute to the useful or decorative arts.--_C.F.H., in N.Y.
