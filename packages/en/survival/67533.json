THE CLOVER PLANT IS RIGHTEOUSLY FAMED AS ONE OF THESE, BUT\r\nALFALFA IS ITS SUPERIOR. ITS ROOTS WORK, SUNDAY AS WELL AS SATURDAY,\r\nNIGHT AND DAY; THEY STRIKE 5, 10, 15 OR 20 FEET DEEP, MAKING INNUMERABLE\r\nPERFORATIONS, WHILE STORING UP NITROGEN, AND WHEN THESE ROOTS DECAY THEY\r\nLEAVE NOT ONLY A GENEROUS SUPPLY OF FERTILITY FOR ANY DESIRED CROP, BUT\r\nMILLIONS OF OPENINGS INTO WHICH THE AIR AND RAIN OF HEAVEN FIND THEIR\r\nWAY, AND HELP TO CONSTITUTE AN UNFAILING RESERVOIR OF WEALTH, UPON WHICH\r\nTHE HUSBANDMAN CAN DRAW WITH LITTLE FEAR OF PROTEST OR OVERDRAFTS.]\r\n\r\n  “Its long, branching roots penetrate far down, push and crowd the\r\n  earth this way and that, and thus constitute a gigantic subsoiler.\r\n  These become an immense magazine of fertility. As soon as cut, they\r\n  begin to decay and liberate the vast reservoir of fertilizing matter\r\n  below the plow, to be drawn upon by other crops for years to come.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Author’s Foreword\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume, however strong its statements in favor of alfalfa may\r\nappear to those unacquainted with that plant’s productivity and\r\nbeneficence, is by no means presented as an argument that everyone\r\nshould raise alfalfa. It is intended rather as a conservative setting\r\nforth of what others have found alfalfa to be and do under wide\r\nvariations of soil, climate, condition and locality; of its\r\ncharacteristics and uses; the most approved methods of its raising and\r\nutilization, and the estimates of it by those who have known it most\r\nintimately and longest as a farm forage crop and a restorer and\r\nrenovator of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe author believes in alfalfa; he believes in it for the big farmer as\r\na profit-bringer in the form of hay, or condensed into beef, pork,\r\nmutton, or products of the cow; but he has a still more abiding faith in\r\nit as a mainstay of the small farmer; for feed for all his live stock\r\nand for maintaining the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the appearance of both special pleading and exaggeration the\r\nstatements have been guarded, and many of a laudatory nature, which\r\nfully authenticated facts seemed to justify, have been omitted, as\r\nneither the author nor the publishers have desire or willingness to\r\nextol unduly a commodity so little needing it as that of which the\r\nvolume treats. Alfalfa’s strongest commendations are invariably from\r\nthose who know it best; none are incredulous who know it well, and none\r\nhave grown it but wished their acreage increased.\r\n\r\n  F. D.

Hoard, of Wisconsin\r\n\r\n_Editor Hoard’s Dairyman_\r\n\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly gratified by the preparation and publication of a new\r\nand larger work devoted to the subject of Alfalfa. The earlier effort by\r\nMr. Coburn upon the same subject was in many respects a classic, and I\r\nam sure farmers everywhere will now hail with joy the advent of a\r\nkindred work by him, still more complete.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, this late awakening all over the Union and in Canada to\r\nthe feeding value and possibilities of this marvelous plant. Again, it\r\nis wonderful to me that within a few years farmers everywhere are being\r\ncompelled to revise their judgment as to their chances of success with\r\nit. A large correspondence on this subject comes to me from every state\r\nin the Union and the provinces of Canada, and success is being had in\r\nthe growing of alfalfa where not more than three years ago it was deemed\r\nimpossible to make it live. Of course the question of growing alfalfa\r\ncontains a thousand or more chances for good or poor judgment. Men who\r\nare not too conceited, too ignorant or too stubborn to learn by reading\r\nother men’s experience will go ahead rapidly and soon make a success of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI believe this alfalfa movement is the most important agricultural event\r\nof the century. For the production of beef, mutton and milk, the\r\ncombination of corn ensilage and rightly cured alfalfa hay, furnishes\r\nalmost a perfect ration, requiring but a small addition of grain feed.\r\nBoth of these can be cheaply and easily produced on nearly every farm in\r\nthe land. In my herd of nearly fifty registered and grade Guernsey cows\r\nthese feeds constitute the sheet anchor of my dairy work.\r\n\r\nNo one more literally abets the growth of two blades of grass where one\r\ngrew before than he who effectively urges the cultivation of alfalfa\r\nupon those who are strangers to it, and no one is more truly working for\r\nthe benefit of agriculture, the basis of all prosperity, than he who\r\nproclaims its excellence as the foremost forage.\r\n\r\n_Hoard’s Dairyman_ will do all in its power to enhance the circulation\r\nand reading of such a book as Mr. Coburn has made.\r\n\r\n  W.

Its\r\nbeginning seems to have been contemporary with that of man, and, as with\r\nman, its first habitat was central Asia, where the progenitors of our\r\nrace knew its capabilities in sustaining all herbivorous animal life,\r\nand where, possibly, it too afforded the herbage which sustained\r\nNebuchadnezzar in his humiliating exile, and eventually restored him to\r\nsanity and manhood.\r\n\r\nIt was carried by the Persians into Greece with the invasion by Xerxes\r\nin 490 B. C., utilized by the Romans in their conquest of Greece, and\r\ncarried to Rome in 146 B. C. Pliny and other writers praise it as a\r\nforage plant and it has been in cultivation in parts of Italy\r\ncontinuously from its introduction. Some writers are disposed to aver\r\nthat it was brought to Spain and France by the Roman soldiery under\r\nCæsar and early thereafter, but more probably it was not introduced\r\ninto those countries until several centuries later. It is known to have\r\nbeen cultivated in Northern Africa about the time it was first brought\r\nto Italy; and the name “alfalfa” being Arabic the inference might be\r\nreasonable that it was introduced into Spain by the Moors from Northern\r\nAfrica at the time of their conquest of Spain about 711 A. D., but this\r\nis of small consequence to the twentieth century. From Spain it crossed\r\nto France, and later to Belgium and England. It was highly spoken of by\r\nan English writer of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA INDEBTED TO SPAIN\r\n\r\nBut in those ages Europe was not so much interested in agriculture as in\r\nwar. Land tenures were not well fixed and ownerships were uncertain.\r\nSpain, however, was to perform at least two important services for half\r\nthe world, if none for herself. She was to reveal to civilization a new\r\ncontinent, and give to it the most valuable forage plant ever known. And\r\nso, in 1519, Cortes, the Spaniard, and his remorseless brigands carried\r\nmurder, rapine and havoc to Mexico, but gave alfalfa. Less than a score\r\nyears later Spain also wrote in Peru and Chili some of the bloodiest\r\npages of human history, but left alfalfa there, where it has since\r\nluxuriantly flourished. If it was brought to the Atlantic coast of the\r\nUnited States in that century, it was not adopted by the Indian\r\ninhabitants, who were not an agricultural people, nor by the early\r\nEuropean settlers.\r\n\r\nIt was not until about 1853 or 1854 that it was introduced into northern\r\nCalifornia, the legends say from Chili, but it had been grown by the\r\nSpaniards and Indians in southern California for probably a hundred\r\nyears, having had a gradual migration from Mexico. Strange to relate,\r\nwhile it is even now on the Atlantic coast discussed as a new plant,\r\nthere is good evidence that it has been in cultivation on a small scale\r\nin the Carolinas, New York and Pennsylvania for probably one hundred and\r\nfifty years. Certainly there are small fields in those states that have\r\nbeen producing for over sixty years, and there are to be found articles\r\nand letters written far earlier showing that it was then known and had\r\nbeen proven. One Spurrier, in a book dedicated to Thomas Jefferson, and\r\nwritten in 1793, spoke highly of alfalfa, called “lucerne;” told how it\r\nshould be cultivated, and that three crops of valuable hay could be cut\r\nannually. In the “Transactions of the Society for the Promotion of\r\nAgriculture,” published at Albany in 1801, it was favorably mentioned,\r\nand in the “Farmers’ Assistant,” printed in Albany in 1815, alfalfa was\r\npraised and the statement made of its yielding 6 to 9 tons of hay per\r\nacre “under the best cultivation and plentiful manuring.” Yet its\r\ncultivation did not spread. The inertia of farmers, or perhaps their\r\nindifference to new ideas, in the early days must have been marvelous.\r\nAccording to Spurrier the difficulties were not considered greater than\r\nnow; he said one planting would survive many years and the yield was\r\nthree times as great as that of any other forage plant. The seed was no\r\ndoubt introduced there from England or France; it was probably scarce,\r\nand difficult to secure from growings in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAME AND ITS ORIGIN\r\n\r\nThe name “Alfalfa” is from an Arabic word meaning “the best fodder,”\r\nwhich honor it can certainly still claim. Many writers have assumed that\r\nthe name “Lucerne” which it bears in France and England, was from the\r\nname of the Swiss canton, Lucerne. This is a mistake as it was not known\r\nthere until long after it was cultivated in France and England. The name\r\nis probably from the Spanish word “Userdas” which the French changed to\r\n“La-cuzerdo” and later to “Luzerne,” still later to “Lizerne” and then\r\nto “Lucerne.”\r\n\r\nAmong other names by which alfalfa is known are the following: Lucerne;\r\nFrench Lucerne; French Clover, in part; Mexican Clover, in part; Lucerne\r\nClover; Lucerne Medicago; Alfalfa Clover; Chilian Clover; Brazilian\r\nClover; Syrian Clover; Sainfoin, erroneously; Spanish Trefoil; Purple\r\nMedick; Manured Medick; Cultivated Medicago; Medick. _Persian_, Isfist;\r\n_Greek_, Medicai; _Latin_, Medica, Herba Medica; _Italian_, Herba\r\nSpagna; _Spanish_, Melga or Meilga, also (from the Arabic), Alfalfa,\r\nAlfasafat; _French_, La Lucerne; _German_, Lucerne, Common Fodder, Snail\r\nClover, Blue Snail Clover, Branching Clover, Stem Clover, Monthly\r\nClover, Horned Clover, in part, Perennial Clover, Blue Perennial Clover,\r\nBurgundy Clover, Welsh Clover, Sicilian Clover.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa belongs to the botanical family Leguminosae, or the legumes, of\r\nwhich there are thousands of species, and is thus related to all\r\nclovers, peas, vetches and beans. Its botanical name is _Medicago\r\nsativa_. There are some fifty species of the genus Medicago that are\r\nknown, but alfalfa and one or two others are all that are of practical\r\nvalue as fodders. It is a true perennial plant, smooth, upright,\r\nbranching, ordinarily growing from one to four feet high, yet in some\r\ninstances much higher, owing to conditions of soil, climate and\r\ncultivation. Its leaves are three parted, each leaflet being broadest\r\nabout the middle, rounded in outline and slightly toothed toward the\r\napex. The purple pea-like flowers instead of being in a head, as in red\r\nclover, are in long, loose clusters or racemes. These are scattered\r\nalong the plant’s stems and branches, instead of being especially borne,\r\nas in red clover, on the extremities of the branches. The matured\r\nseed-pods are spirally twisted through two or three complete curves, and\r\neach pod contains several seeds. The seeds are kidney-shaped, and\r\naverage about one-twelfth of an inch long by half as thick. They are\r\nabout one-half larger than seeds of red clover, and in color are at\r\ntheir best an olive green or a bright egg-yellow, instead of a reddish\r\nor mustard yellow, or faded brown. The ends of the seeds are slightly\r\ncompressed where they are crowded together in the pod.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa is very long-lived; fields in Mexico, it is claimed, have been\r\ncontinuously productive without replanting for over two hundred years,\r\nand others in France are known to have flourished for more than a\r\ncentury. Its usual life in the United States is probably from ten to\r\ntwenty-five years, although there is a field in New York that has been\r\nmown successively for over sixty years. It is not unlikely that under\r\nits normal conditions and with normal care it would well-nigh be, as it\r\nis called, everlasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS WONDERFUL ROOT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIn its root growth it is probably the greatest wonder among plants.\r\nWhile it usually grows no higher than four or five feet (although it has\r\nbeen known to reach more than ten feet; an unirrigated stalk is on\r\nexhibition at the office of the Kansas Board of Agriculture, measuring\r\nnearly seven feet) and its normal height is about three feet, its roots\r\ngo down ten, twenty, or more feet, and one case in Nevada is reported by\r\nCharles W. Irish, chief of Irrigation Inquiry United States Department\r\nof Agriculture, where the roots were found penetrating through crevices\r\nin the roof of a tunnel one hundred and twenty-nine feet below the\r\nsurface of an alfalfa field. Prof. W. P. Headden of Colorado found roots\r\nnine feet long from alfalfa only nine months old, and another reports\r\nroots seventeen inches long of but four weeks’ growth, the plants being\r\nbut six inches high. It usually has a slender taproot, with many\r\nbranches tending downward, yet with considerable lateral growth. As the\r\ntaproot is piercing the earth it is also sending out new fibrous roots,\r\nwhile the upper ones, decaying, are leaving humus and providing\r\ninnumerable openings for air, the rains, and fertilizing elements from\r\nthe surface soil. The mechanical effect of this root-growth and decay in\r\nthe soil constitutes one of the greatest virtues of the plant, and by\r\nits roots alfalfa becomes, self-acting, by far the most efficient, deep\r\nreaching subsoiler and renovator known to agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES AND PECULIARITIES\r\n\r\nThere are several other varieties of alfalfa besides _Medicago sativa_,\r\nthe most common being the _Intermediate Lucerne_ or _Medicago media_,\r\nthe Yellow Lucerne or _Medicago foliata_ and Turkestan alfalfa or\r\n_Medicago sativa Turkestanica_. None of these have such unqualified\r\nvalue as the ordinary alfalfa; in fact the first two are properly\r\nregarded as weeds when found with _Medicago sativa_. In 1898 when there\r\nhad been reported many failures in the alfalfa districts of the extreme\r\nNorth and the extreme Southwest, the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture sent Prof. N. E. Hansen of South Dakota to Russia,\r\nespecially the cold, arid and semi-arid portions of northern Turkestan,\r\nto discover if possible a more hardy strain of alfalfa than that grown\r\nin America. He brought back from there several hundred bushels of seed\r\nwhich was distributed to government stations and individual\r\nexperimenters in forty-seven states and territories. The reports of its\r\nbehavior varied greatly, some growers being enthusiastically in its\r\nfavor, while most reported results below or not above the average from\r\nother sorts, and some practically a failure. It would appear from the\r\nconsensus of opinion at this time that the Turkestan alfalfa has not\r\ndemonstrated in America any such superiority as to justify its general\r\nadoption, even in the dry and warm regions of the Southwest, in our\r\ncolder states, or in Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =An Eight-year-old Alfalfa Plant=\r\n\r\nwith 312 stems growing from one root. Grown at Manhattan, Kan., on high\r\nupland prairie having a stiff, hardpan subsoil. Depth to water 180 feet\r\nHeight of growth May 6, ten inches]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Crown of Plant Shown in the Preceding Illustration=\r\n\r\nStalks removed to show branching crown]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alfalfa Blossoms Enlarged]\r\n\r\nAmong other claims for Turkestan alfalfa by the government officials in\r\ncharge of its introduction and exploitation have been that “its seed\r\nwill germinate much quicker and the plants start into growth earlier\r\nunder the same conditions than common alfalfa. The plants are more\r\nleafy, grow more rapidly, and have a stronger, more vigorous root\r\nsystem. Another advantage which the Turkestan variety has is that the\r\nstems are more slender and less woody, the plants making a more\r\nnutritious hay of finer quality. That it will withstand drought under\r\nthe same conditions better than ordinary alfalfa seems certain from the\r\nreports of the experimenters. In the West and Northwest, at least, it\r\nseems to be more productive, both with and without irrigation.”\r\n\r\nAt the North Dakota station Turkestan alfalfa sown in 1901 yielded in\r\nthe three years following (1902-3-4) at the average rate of slightly\r\nmore than two tons per acre annually.\r\n\r\nAcclimation of alfalfa is a slow process, and numerous close observers\r\nthink there are too many radical differences in climate and possibly of\r\nsoil between Turkestan and New Mexico, or North Dakota, to admit of this\r\nvariety’s becoming a preeminently valuable acquisition to America. It is\r\nthought more reasonable to let the American-grown alfalfa gradually\r\naccustom itself, as it will, to any particular region, sowing seed from\r\nnearly the same latitude and grown under as nearly as possible the\r\nconditions it will encounter in its new environment.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 the Department of Agriculture began experimenting on a small\r\nscale at stations in Arizona, California and the warm regions with\r\nalfalfa seed procured by Mr. D. G. Fairchild, from Arabia. The officials\r\nin charge observe that the plants from this seed appear to make a much\r\nquicker growth after cutting, and as a result of this one more crop in a\r\nseason than is obtained from other alfalfa may be possible. It differs\r\nfrom other strains in having larger leaflets and in being much more\r\nhairy. “It is thought very probable that by careful selection hardiness\r\ncan be bred into Arabian alfalfa so that it will grow much farther north\r\nthan it does at present.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OPINION FROM HEADQUARTERS\r\n\r\nAs a latter day opinion or estimate of alfalfa from an official who is\r\npresumed to speak as an authority, without bias and knowing his subject,\r\nthe words of W. J. Spillman, agrostologist of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, should carry weight. In an address before the\r\neleventh annual convention of the National Hay Association, at St.\r\nLouis, in 1904, Professor Spillman said:\r\n\r\n“Alfalfa is the oldest plant known to man; it is the most valuable\r\nforage plant ever discovered. It has not been appreciated in the eastern\r\npart of the United States until the last five years. We are now growing\r\nit successfully in every state in the Union, and I believe it is safe to\r\nsay in every agricultural county in the United States it is being grown\r\nwith success. Two weeks ago I secured a picture of a field of alfalfa in\r\nSouth Carolina that was sowed over sixty-nine years ago. It was still in\r\npretty good condition. I know of another field in New York State sowed\r\nforty-five years ago, and one in Minnesota that was sowed thirty-three\r\nyears ago. All over the West there are thousands of fields of alfalfa\r\nthat were sowed twenty-five years ago that are still yielding large\r\ncrops. In Wisconsin alfalfa yields three crops of hay a year, and in\r\nTexas, four and five large crops. In southern California, below\r\nsea-level, where they never have any frost, they cut alfalfa eleven\r\ntimes a year, and in Texas, south of the Rio Grande, they cut it nine\r\ntimes a year.\r\n\r\n“Alfalfa does not exhaust the soil. Nitrogen is the soil’s most\r\nimportant element, and the one most liable to give out; the one the\r\nfarmer is called upon to supply first. Alfalfa does not ask the farmer\r\nfor nitrogen at all, because it can get its nitrogen out of the\r\natmosphere. Four-fifths of the atmosphere consists of nitrogen.\r\nOrdinarily, plants cannot make use of that nitrogen at all; the roots of\r\nthe alfalfa will leave in the soil eight or ten times as much nitrogen\r\nas was there before. The farmer who plants alfalfa, clover or peas does\r\nnot have to get nitrogen from the fertilizer factories. I know one\r\nfarmer who for the past eight years has made an average of eight and\r\none-half tons per acre of alfalfa on irrigated land in the state of\r\nWashington. I have heard of other men that produced twelve tons an acre\r\nin southern Texas on irrigated land. It would hardly be possible to\r\nproduce that much on land that is not irrigated, because rain does not\r\ncome to order.\r\n\r\n“I have lived ten years in a country where the horses, cattle, sheep,\r\nhogs and chickens eat alfalfa hay, or green alfalfa, the year round. It\r\nis the richest hay food known. Eleven pounds of it is worth as much for\r\nfeeding purposes as ten pounds of bran.”\r\n\r\nA most pleasing word-picture of alfalfa is that by Geo. L. Clothier, M.\r\nS., who has studied his subject closely in the field, the feed lot and\r\nthe laboratory, and he paints it thus:\r\n\r\n“The cultivation and feeding of alfalfa mark the highest development of\r\nour modern agriculture. Alfalfa is one of nature’s choicest gifts to\r\nman. It is the preserver and the conserver of the homestead. It is\r\npeculiarly adapted to a country with a republican government, for it\r\nsmiles alike on the rich and the poor. It does not fail from old age. It\r\nloves the sunshine, converting the sunbeams into gold coin in the\r\npockets of the thrifty husbandman. It is the greatest mortgage lifter\r\nyet discovered.\r\n\r\n“The alfalfa plant furnishes the protein to construct and repair the\r\nbrains of statesmen. It builds up the muscles and bones of the\r\nwar-horse, and gives his rider sinews of iron. Alfalfa makes the hens\r\ncackle and the turkeys gobble. It induces the pigs to squeal and grunt\r\nwith satisfaction. It causes the contented cow to give pailsful of\r\ncreamy milk, and the Shorthorn and white-faced steers to bawl for the\r\nfeed rack. Alfalfa softens the disposition of the colt and hardens his\r\nbones and muscles. It fattens lambs as no other feed, and promotes a\r\nwool clip that is a veritable golden fleece. It compels skim-milk calves\r\nto make gains of two pounds per day. It helps the farmer to produce pork\r\nat a cent and a half a pound and beef at two cents.\r\n\r\n“Alfalfa transforms the upland farm from a sometime waste of gullied\r\nclay banks into an undulating meadow fecund with plant-food. It drills\r\nfor water, working 365 days in the year without any recompense from man.\r\nThe labor it performs in penetrating the subsoil is enormous. No other\r\nagricultural plant leaves the soil in such good physical condition as\r\nalfalfa. It prospects beneath the surface of the earth and brings her\r\nhidden treasures to the light of day. It takes the earth, air, moisture\r\nand sunshine, and transmutes them into nourishing feed stuffs and into\r\ntints of green and purple, and into nectar and sweet perfumes, alluring\r\nthe busy bees to visits of reciprocity, whereon they caress the alfalfa\r\nblossoms, which, in their turn, pour out secretions of nectar fit for\r\nJupiter to sip. It forms a partnership with the micro-organisms of the\r\nearth by which it is enabled to enrich the soil upon which it feeds. It\r\nbrings gold into the farmer’s purse by processes more mysterious than\r\nthe alchemy of old. The farmer with a fifty-acre meadow of alfalfa will\r\nhave steady, enjoyable employment from June to October; for as soon as\r\nhe has finished gathering the hay at one end of the field it will be\r\nagain ready for the mower at the other. The homes surrounded by fields\r\nof alfalfa have an esthetic advantage unknown to those where the plant\r\nis not grown. The alfalfa meadow is clothed with purple and green and\r\nexhales fragrant, balmy odors throughout the growing season to be wafted\r\nby the breezes into the adjacent farmhouses.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Intergrading Types of Seed Between Alfalfa and Sweet\r\nClover=\r\n\r\nThe six seeds to the left being alfalfa, the five to the right Sweet\r\nclover.

It is grown profitably\r\nin every country of Europe, in central Asia, its original home, in\r\nAustralia, the islands of the sea, and in almost every state and\r\nterritory of the United States, and in Canada. Only two states, Maine\r\nand New Hampshire, and only one territory, Alaska, are left wholly in\r\nthe experimental column. Everywhere else there have been such results as\r\nto prove that it ought to become, in greater or less degree, a staple\r\ncrop on practically every farm, dependent only upon more energy, faith\r\nand skill on the part of the farmer, and a natural acclimation. There\r\nare several other states such as Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nRhode Island, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Dakota\r\nwhere the experiment station experts are not fully ready to recommend it\r\nas a regular crop for every farm, yet, in each of these there are\r\nenterprising farmers who have for years found profit in its raising. The\r\nstation authorities in Vermont say that success with alfalfa there\r\n“depends first on the man, and second on the soil.”\r\n\r\nW. R. Dodson, botanist of the Louisiana station, says it is his firm\r\nconviction that nothing will contribute so much as alfalfa toward making\r\nthe southern farm self-supplied with feed for work animals, for the\r\nproduction of dairy products, and home raised meat. “I doubt,” he also\r\nsays, “if alfalfa does better anywhere outside the irrigated regions of\r\nthe West than it does in the alluvial lands of Louisiana. We have had as\r\nhigh as eight cuttings in one year, with a total tonnage larger than is\r\nhad in Kansas or Nebraska, and our annual rainfall is sixty-five inches,\r\nor more.”\r\n\r\nFrom Ontario, Canada, comes a report of a yield of four tons to the acre\r\nin three cuttings, on a clay hillside; at far-off Medicine Hat,\r\nNorthwest Territory, it makes a growth pronounced “phenomenal,” and at\r\nthe experimental farm at Brandon, Manitoba, three cuttings per year are\r\nharvested. On a gravelly hill in the District of Columbia, a field was\r\nsown in April, 1900. Two crops were cut from it that summer, three in\r\n1901, and the first cutting in 1902 yielded three tons per acre. In\r\nsouthern Minnesota, some thrifty Germans, not knowing that “alfalfa will\r\nnot grow in Minnesota,” have been raising it since 1872, while others\r\nwere declaring it impossible. A half-score of men in the sagebrush wilds\r\nof Nevada decided to try it, and in 1872 they had 625 prosperous acres,\r\nwithout plowing and without irrigation. J. H. Grisdale, agriculturist of\r\nthe Central experimental farm at Ottawa, (Bul. No. 46) says, “it is\r\ngrown in Canada more or less extensively from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific. It is the staple forage plant for winter in the dryer part of\r\nBritish Columbia, and it has been grown in Southern Alberta for many\r\nyears. It is not much known in Manitoba, but is possible of easy\r\npropagation in almost all parts of Ontario. It is, and has been grown\r\nlong and successfully in Quebec, and is not unknown in Nova Scotia and\r\nNew Brunswick.” In Cape Colony, South Africa, “lucerne can be cut from\r\nfour to six times in summer and from once to twice in winter, and is the\r\ngreatest forage plant in the world.” In 1901 the British consul at\r\nBuenos Ayres reported alfalfa as covering “an enormous area in\r\nArgentina, and every year becoming more important.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT PARTICULAR AS TO SOIL\r\n\r\nWhile experts have been declaring that alfalfa would only grow in\r\ncertain soils and in certain climates it has proven adaptability to\r\nnearly all climates and almost all soils. It produces with a rainfall as\r\nscant as 14 inches, and in the Gulf states flourishes with 65 inches. It\r\ngives crops at an elevation of 8000 feet above sea level, and in\r\nsouthern California it grows below sea level to a height of six feet or\r\nover, with nine cuttings a year, aggregating ten to twelve tons. An\r\nauthenticated photograph in possession of the writer, reproduced\r\nopposite page 231, shows a wonderful alfalfa plant raised in the\r\n(irrigated) desert of southern California, sixty feet below sea level,\r\nthat measured considerably more than ten feet in height. Satisfactory\r\ncrops are raised, but on limited areas as yet, in Vermont and Florida.\r\nNew York has grown it for over one hundred years in her clay and gravel;\r\nNebraska grows it in her western sand hills without plowing, as does\r\nNevada on her sagebrush desert. The depleted cotton soils of Alabama\r\nand rich corn lands of Illinois and Missouri each respond generously\r\nwith profitable yields to the enterprising farmer, while its accumulated\r\nnitrogen and the sub-soiling it effects are making the rich land more\r\nvaluable and giving back to the crop-worn the priceless elements of\r\nwhich it has been in successive generations despoiled by a\r\nconscienceless husbandry.\r\n\r\nIts introduction into Maryland was largely through the perseverance of\r\nProf. W. T. L. Taliaferro of the agricultural college, who says: “The\r\nfuture for alfalfa for southern Maryland is bright, indeed, and with its\r\ngeneral introduction will come a new era of prosperity for the ‘lower\r\ncounties.’ Live stock farming will take the place of tobacco farming.\r\nThe fertilizing elements of the soil will be concentrated at home\r\ninstead of being shipped abroad. Larger crops will be raised. Soil\r\nimprovement will take the place of soil exhaustion; worn-out farms will\r\nbe restored to their original fertility.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORACLES REFUTED\r\n\r\nOne by one the oracular statements of so-called experts have been shown\r\nat fault. One said, “it will grow wherever corn will grow;” and as\r\npromptly men from New York and Louisiana rise and say that they are\r\ngrowing it where corn will not grow. Another declares, “it will not grow\r\nover a hardpan or gumbo subsoil;” at once a New York man reports a good\r\nfield of alfalfa with roots fifteen feet long that pass through six\r\ninches of hardpan which was so hard that it had to be broken with a pick\r\naxe in following the root. A Kansas man writes that he has eighty acres\r\nthat has stood five years and promises to continue indefinitely,\r\nyielding 4¹⁄₂ tons from three cuttings a year, and the whole of it on\r\ngumbo soil where corn raising was a failure. Another declares, “it must\r\nhave a rich, sandy loam,” and forthwith from the deserts of Nevada, the\r\nsand hills of Nebraska and the thin, worn, clay soils of the South come\r\nreports of satisfactory yields. Such results are significant, indicating\r\nbetter returns than any other crop brings from these varied soils, and\r\nthat few farmers are justified in postponing the addition of alfalfa to\r\ntheir agriculture because of supposed hindrance of soil and climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW YORK EXAMPLE\r\n\r\nAs citing an example, and suggestive of the fact that alfalfa not only\r\ngrows but flourishes in the eastern states where the claim has been made\r\nthat it would not grow, the following by the editor of the _Rural\r\nNew-Yorker_, in his journal of September 3, 1904, is forcibly to the\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n“A farmer visiting the New York state fair this year will do well to\r\ntake time to look at some of the alfalfa fields near Syracuse. Whether\r\nit means that the soil in this locality is well suited to alfalfa, or\r\nthat farmers have learned how to grow it, it is a fact that the crop\r\nmakes a wonderful showing there. You find it everywhere--in great\r\nbillowy fields of green, along the roadsides--even in vacant city lots.\r\nThe crop crowds in whether the seed is sown by hand, dropped from a\r\npassing load or scattered by the wind. The majority of the farms show\r\ngreat fields of it, and the character of farming is slowly changing as\r\nmore and more alfalfa is cut. On fruit farms or small private places the\r\ncrop is changing methods and habits. A few acres in alfalfa provides\r\nall the roughness needed for stock on these small places, and gives\r\nextra room for fruit or similar crops. In fact, the most interesting\r\nthing about these alfalfa fields is the way they are changing the entire\r\nconditions of the country. It is similar to what happens when a new\r\nindustry is established in a town or city.\r\n\r\n“The Grange meeting at a Mr. Worker’s farm, was held in a great barn. He\r\nhad delayed the alfalfa cutting so that the barn might be empty. Some\r\nother farmers nearby had already cut. I had a chance to see alfalfa\r\ngrowing under what seemed to me about the toughest chance you can give a\r\nplant. The city of Syracuse is buying gravel from his field, to use on\r\nthe street. The workmen are digging right into the hill, and it requires\r\nhard labor to pick up this tough, hard soil. As they dig they follow the\r\nroots of the alfalfa down. Some of the roots are quite as large as my\r\nthumb, and I am sure that many of them had gone down twenty feet at\r\nleast into this tough soil. These big roots make plowing an alfalfa sod\r\nanything but fun. This is one of the few objections to the crop. I had\r\nsupposed that the plant does its best where it can work down into an\r\nopen or gravel subsoil. I have been told by one who is called an\r\n‘expert’ that alfalfa cannot thrive on a hardpan subsoil, yet here it\r\nwas going down into the toughest soil I ever saw, and covering the\r\nsurface with a perfect mat of green stalks. Mr. Worker goes so far as to\r\nsay that the tougher the subsoil the better the alfalfa goes through it,\r\nprovided water does not stand about the roots. That is one point upon\r\nwhich all agree--the alfalfa cannot stand wet feet. It must have water\r\nenough; that is why its roots go down so far, but it will not thrive in\r\nwet fields where water does not run easily away.\r\n\r\n“On other farms I saw the alfalfa growing at the top of steep clay\r\nhills, which were formerly almost useless for farm purposes unless\r\nstuffed with stable manure. Now that alfalfa has been started these\r\nhill-tops have become about the most profitable fields on the farm. At\r\nanother place I saw a fair crop of alfalfa growing in a thin streak of\r\nsoil over a rocky ledge. There were not eighteen inches of soil covering\r\nthe solid rock, yet the alfalfa was thriving. I have been told that this\r\nis the condition under which alfalfa will not grow, yet here it was\r\ngiving more forage than any red clover we can grow. I have said that the\r\nspreading of these alfalfa fields is changing the character of farming\r\nin central New York. It is not easy to realize just what this means\r\nwithout visiting this favored section. This new forage plant brings\r\nfertility and feed to the farm. It is just like having a fertilizer\r\nfactory and a feed store drop out of the skies upon the farm, to get\r\nthis alfalfa well started. Of course as the farmer learns what the crop\r\nwill do he uses it more and more to feed both stock and the farm. It\r\nwould not be a very bright farmer who would continue to grow wheat or\r\nsome other annual crop which brings him $25 per acre when a permanent\r\ncrop like alfalfa will guarantee $60. Some farmers are quicker to see\r\nthis than others, but in the end the majority of them see it and then we\r\nsee a change. These alfalfa farmers are giving a great object lesson,\r\nand their farms are more interesting than any exhibit at the state\r\nfair.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER III._\r\n\r\nYields, and Comparisons With Other Crops\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARED WITH CLOVER\r\n\r\nMany things are understood best through contrasts with others better\r\nknown. In every part of the country certain crops are considered\r\nstandard, and all others are judged by comparison with these. For\r\nexample, red clover in most parts of the United States is ranked as the\r\nrichest and best yielding forage, and the fertilizer and renovator _par\r\nexcellence_.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts experiment station after a series of tests reports\r\nthat 100 pounds of clover contain 47.49 pounds of digestible food and\r\n6.95 pounds of proteids, while 100 pounds of alfalfa contain 54.43\r\npounds of digestible food and 11.22 pounds of proteids.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey station reports that the average yield per annum of green\r\nclover to the acre is 14,000 pounds, and of green alfalfa 36,500 pounds;\r\nthe protein in the clover is 616 pounds and in the alfalfa, 2214 pounds;\r\none ton of alfalfa has 265 pounds of protein, and clover only 246\r\npounds. But alfalfa will produce three, four, or more cuttings each\r\nyear, while clover will produce but one or at most two. Further, clover\r\nwill ordinarily survive but two years, while alfalfa will last from ten\r\nto one hundred, thus saving many plowings and seedings. It is also\r\nestimated that the stubble and root-growth of alfalfa are worth at least\r\nfour times as much for humus as are those of clover, while the\r\nmechanical and other beneficent effects of the long alfalfa roots far\r\nexcel those of clover. The alfalfa field is green for pasturage a month\r\nearlier in the spring than clover and may be mowed a month earlier. It\r\nstarts a vigorous growth at once after cutting, covering the ground with\r\nits luxuriant foliage before the second growth of clover has made any\r\nsubstantial progress.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin experiment station says that “one acre of alfalfa yields\r\nas much protein as three acres of clover, as much as nine acres of\r\ntimothy and twelve times as much as an acre of brome grass.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISONS WITH SEVERAL GRASSES\r\n\r\n  -----+--------------------------------------------+-----+---------\r\n       |                                            |     | Yield\r\n   Plat|                                            | Hay,|per acre,\r\n    No.|     Variety Grown                          | lbs.|  lbs.\r\n  -----+--------------------------------------------+-----+---------\r\n   1   |June Clover                                 | 473 |  2,365\r\n   2   |Mammoth Clover                              | 475 |  2,375\r\n   3   |Alsike Clover                               | 413 |  2,065\r\n   4[1]|Alfalfa (first cutting) 26 inches high, June|     |\r\n       |29th                                        | 816 |  4,080\r\n   5   | Blue-grass                                 | 575 |  2,875\r\n   6   | Orchard grass                              | 478 |  2,390\r\n   7   | Timothy                                    | 560 |  2,800\r\n   8   | Red-top                                    | 470 |  2,350\r\n   9   | Meadow fescue                              | 375 |  1,875\r\n  10   | Tall meadow oat grass                      | 600 |  3,000\r\n  11   | Italian rye grass                          |.... |   ....\r\n  12[2]| Timothy, blue-grass and orchard grass mixed| 203 |  1,015\r\n  -----+--------------------------------------------+-----+---------\r\n\r\n  [1] The alfalfa plat yielded a second cutting 26 inches high on August\r\n  2nd, and a third 24 inches high September 1st; there was also a\r\n  six-inch after-growth estimated at 180 pounds.

D. Hoard, of Wisconsin, reports from three-fifths of\r\nan acre on his farm in the southern part of the state, four cuttings in\r\none season, yielding 5.7 tons of hay.\r\n\r\nAlva Langston, of Henry county, Indiana, sowed five acres of alfalfa May\r\n20th, and harvested nearly 1¹⁄₂ tons of hay per acre August 25th\r\nfollowing, and about the same quantity September 20th to 25th. This was\r\non upland, thirty or more years in cultivation. The alfalfa was clipped\r\ntwice before the cutting for hay.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 F. S. Kirk of Garfield county, Oklahoma, sowed a field near a\r\ncreek, but about 25 feet above water, with thirty to thirty-five pounds\r\nof alfalfa seed per acre, broadcast. The soil, which he calls “high\r\nbottom,” was a dark brown and contained considerable sand. For two years\r\nno attention was given the alfalfa except harvesting from it three crops\r\nthe second year and four the third year. In 1905 he harvested from ten\r\nacres nine cuttings, estimated to weigh fully one and one-half tons\r\neach, per acre. The longest time between any two cuttings was twenty-two\r\ndays, and the shortest fourteen days. During the season of 1904 seven\r\ncuttings were made and the field was gone over with a disk harrow early\r\neach time after removing the hay from the field. It was possible to cut\r\nanother growth of 8 to 12 inches, had he not preferred to use it as\r\npasturage for stock.\r\n\r\nMr. Kirk does not irrigate and maintains that in his part of the country\r\n“the best irrigation for alfalfa is with a disk harrow.” He also insists\r\nthat “alfalfa can be entirely killed by disking in the dark of the\r\nmoon,” especially if the weather that follows is hot and dry. He\r\npastures his alfalfa with cattle and horses in fall and spring, and\r\ndisks in the spring as soon as the stock is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME MONEY COMPARISONS\r\n\r\nA good acre corn crop in Ohio is forty bushels, worth not to exceed $20,\r\nafter all the labor of cultivating and husking; the stover, if properly\r\ncared for, ought to be worth $5, making a total of $25. An Ohio farmer\r\nreports a yield of 4¹⁄₂ tons of alfalfa hay per acre, worth for feed as\r\ncompared with the price of bran about $12 per ton, or a total value of\r\n$54, from only one plowing in six years (as long as he let it stand) and\r\nwith less labor in harvesting than for husking corn and caring for the\r\nstover.\r\n\r\nA good Kansas or Nebraska corn yield (far above the state average) is 50\r\nbushels per acre, worth ordinarily about $17, with stover worth $3. The\r\nfarmer should obtain from his alfalfa at least four to five tons, worth\r\nto him for feed for cattle, hogs or sheep from $10 to $12 per\r\nton--practically two or three times his income from an acre of corn,\r\nwhile the cost of production is much less.\r\n\r\nThe average year’s corn or wheat crop is worth only about $10 per acre,\r\nwhile the average alfalfa crop is worth on the market from $15 to $35,\r\nor more, per acre, owing to the market appreciation of the crop, and\r\nfrom $35 to $60 as feed for stock.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of acres in western Kansas and Nebraska are now returning\r\nfrom their alfalfa fields an income of from $15 to $25 per acre where\r\nbut a few years earlier the land was deemed worthless for agriculture.\r\nHundreds of acres in western New York that were returning only a small\r\nincome above cost of labor and fertilization are now supporting great\r\nmoney making dairies from alfalfa. Cotton land in the South rents for $5\r\nper acre, while alfalfa fields bring a yearly rental of three times that\r\namount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Sweet Clover Alfalfa Yellow Trefoil=\r\n\r\nThe Sweet clover and alfalfa are magnified five diameters and the\r\ntrefoil seven diameters]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Three Distinctive Types of Alfalfa Seed Magnified Twelve\r\nTimes=\r\n\r\nThe one at the left rounded; the one at the right kidney-shaped; and the\r\none in the middle angular pointed. The latter is the most characteristic\r\nform seen in alfalfa seed]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IV._\r\n\r\nSeed and Seed Selection\r\n\r\n\r\nNO SUCCESS WITHOUT GOOD SEED\r\n\r\nIt is a time-worn but no less true saying that good seed is essential to\r\ngood agriculture. No matter how well the farmer prepares his land, no\r\nmatter how much time, labor and money he spends on it, if much or all of\r\nhis seed fails to grow, he will either have a poor crop or be obliged to\r\nreseed, thus losing time and labor. Many causes may contribute to\r\nprevent a good stand, but if he can eliminate any one of these, he is by\r\nso much the gainer. Poor seed is a primary and great cause of a poor\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nThe farmer obtains his seed from one of two sources; he raises it or\r\nbuys it. If the former, there should be less danger, as the chief source\r\nof poor seed is careless handling in harvesting and storing. If the seed\r\nbecomes damp, mold will damage much of it, or it will sprout, then dry\r\nout, and the germ be killed. If seed is bought of strangers or from a\r\ndistance, the chances of poor quality increase many fold. If all seed\r\nwere bought of reliable dealers, there would be less cause for\r\ncomplaint, but farmers too often buy where they can buy cheapest. They\r\npay for trash that is either full of harmful weed seeds or has a liberal\r\nadmixture of old and dead seeds left over from previous seasons.\r\n\r\nBefore seed is purchased it should be tested for purity and germination.\r\nThe adage that a dollar saved is a dollar earned well applies here; it\r\nis an easy matter to waste a dollar on seed, and when profit depends on\r\navoidance of useless expenditure the use of inferior seed points its own\r\nmoral.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF SIMILAR CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nThe farmer who has brought himself to the point of introducing alfalfa\r\nupon his farm should be extremely careful in the selection of seed. In\r\nthe first place it is important that he should sow such as is produced\r\nin about the same latitude as his farm and from a region of about the\r\nsame rainfall, thus keeping in a line of acclimation, and with the\r\nhabits and habitat, as it were, of what he is seeking to raise. Next, he\r\nshould not sow seed raised under irrigation if he is in a non-irrigation\r\nregion. A Michigan farmer, for example, should sow seed grown as near to\r\nhis latitude as possible, say, from Wisconsin, Minnesota or the Dakotas,\r\nor not south of Nebraska or Kansas. It is questionable, at present,\r\nwhether it is wise or profitable to attempt raising alfalfa seed in the\r\nmore humid districts of the eastern and southern parts of the United\r\nStates. It may be economy to leave the raising of seed to those regions\r\nwith the least summer rainfall, keeping always in mind the securing of\r\nseed grown under conditions nearly like those to which the seed is to be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the alleged different varieties of alfalfa, the seed of\r\nwhich is urged upon buyers by seedsmen, the editor of the _Oklahoma Farm\r\nJournal_ pertinently says:\r\n\r\n“We see occasional references to ‘dry land’ alfalfa and statements that\r\nit’s a kind that just longs for the hilltops so that it may turn off big\r\ncrops of rich hay from land too dry and hard to yield good sorghum.\r\nDon’t forget that the one thing to look for when purchasing alfalfa seed\r\nis good seed, that will grow. It’s hard to find and the price is usually\r\nhigh. When you buy it, buy subject to test and send a fair sample of\r\nabout an ounce to your experiment station, where it will be tested\r\nwithout charge. At the present time there is but one variety of alfalfa\r\nthat Oklahoma farmers should buy, and that is good alfalfa seed. There\r\nis no ‘dry land’ variety of alfalfa, and the much boomed Turkestan\r\nvariety isn’t as good for sowing in Oklahoma as Oklahoma or Kansas grown\r\nseed. Rich soil, thorough preparation, good seed well sowed, cutting at\r\nthe right time, harrowing when weeds and grass bother, all these are\r\nrequisite to success with this most valuable crop, and it pays for all\r\nthe bother.”\r\n\r\nSeed from Nebraska and northwestern Kansas has been generally successful\r\nthrough Iowa and Illinois, and is probably adapted to Ohio and southern\r\nPennsylvania. Utah seed produces good crops in Minnesota, the extremes\r\nof cold and heat in Utah having developed a strain that does well in\r\ncold climates. The writer would use Utah grown seed for New York,\r\nnorthern New Jersey and northern Pennsylvania, and seed from Wyoming or\r\nMontana for New England. On the sandy land of southern New Jersey, in\r\nDelaware and Maryland, the seed grown in southern Colorado and southern\r\nKansas ought to do well.\r\n\r\nProf. H. M. Cottrell, formerly agriculturist of the Kansas experiment\r\nstation, says: “One year I sowed 20 acres to alfalfa--19 acres with Utah\r\ngrown seed and one acre with imported seed; both showed a germination of\r\nover 98 per cent, and the growth was good from both lots all through the\r\nseason, with no difference that could be detected. The next spring there\r\nwas a good stand all over the 19 acres seeded with Utah seed, and not a\r\nsingle live plant on the acre seeded with the imported seed. I have seen\r\nseveral trials with imported seed, and never yet saw a good crop\r\nharvested from it. Usually after passing through the first winter there\r\nis from one-fourth to one-half a stand from such seed; the plants make a\r\nweak growth and, if allowed to remain, most of them die out in two or\r\nthree years. Descriptions of the puny growth in reports of failures of\r\nthis crop, given by eastern growers, make one think that probably\r\nimported seed had been sown. No intelligent farmer would take corn grown\r\nin the warm soil and climate and long season of southern Kansas and\r\nexpect to grow a good crop in New York on heavy soil with short seasons.\r\nIt is even more difficult to succeed with so great a change in growing\r\nalfalfa, as it would have to withstand the long severe winter, as well\r\nas the change in summer conditions. No one should sow alfalfa seed\r\nwithout knowing where and under what conditions it was grown.”\r\n\r\nNew seed, other conditions being right, is always preferable, although\r\nthat kept for several years, properly cared for, may have retained most\r\nof its germinability. Such tests as have been made appeared to show a\r\nloss in well stored seed of only about one and one-half per cent of\r\ngerminability in five years. W. P. Headden (Colorado Bul. No. 35) after\r\nvarious experiments declares, “the results are positive in showing that\r\nthe age of seed up to six years does not affect its germinating power.”\r\nIt is usually handled and stored by seedsmen in the ordinary seamless\r\ncotton sacks holding from 150 to 160 pounds, and quoted and sold by the\r\npound or hundred-pounds instead of by the bushel. The legal weight of a\r\nbushel of recleaned alfalfa seed is sixty pounds.\r\n\r\nAlthough the seed is handled in sacks for convenience, seedsmen say\r\nthere is no good reason why it might not be safely stored in bulk in\r\nbins without any deterioration from heating, or otherwise. There might,\r\nhowever, be some degree of danger from weevils or other insect pests in\r\nwarm weather. Exposed to too much light, seed will lose its bright\r\nyellow color and change to a brownish cast. When stored, dealers say, it\r\ndoes not go through a “sweating” process as do the seeds of some other\r\nforage plants and grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF SEED\r\n\r\nIn years of large production in America and a shortage in other\r\ncountries, considerable American seed goes abroad to Italy, France,\r\nGermany and Australia. The largest portion is consigned to Germany\r\nbecause extensive seed houses at Hamburg act as distributers to all\r\nportions of the world, from which they receive demands.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the United States has been a buyer rather than a seller,\r\nand imports have been as follows:\r\n\r\n   Year      Lbs.\r\n  1902-3  1,018,559\r\n  1903-4  2,200,267\r\n  1904-5  2,865,324\r\n\r\nAccording to the government authorities the bulk of the imported seed\r\ncomes from Germany and France. That having the best reputation in Europe\r\ncomes from Provence, (southeastern) France. A small quantity comes from\r\nItaly, but it is not generally considered to be of as good quality as\r\nthat grown farther north. Seedsmen complain that many consignments of\r\nthe foreign seed contain large quantities of Yellow trefoil and Bur\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nIt is a fallacy popular among farmers and country seed dealers that\r\ngreat quantities of alfalfa seed are exported to be used for dyeing\r\npurposes. There is no foundation in fact for such a belief, and the\r\nexportations made, like the importations, are for seeding purposes\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPURITIES AND ADULTERATIONS\r\n\r\nA foremost source of danger and loss, aside from infertile seed, is\r\nimpurities and adulterants in the alfalfa seed planted. Growers often\r\nare careless and do not examine their alfalfa before or at the time of\r\nharvesting, and do not reclean their seed after threshing, thus sending\r\nout among innocent purchasers seed mixed with those of weeds, inferior\r\ngrasses and forage plants, and with various trash which adds bulk and\r\nweight but has no value. The commonest seed adulterants or impurities\r\nare those of Sweet clover (_Melilotus alba_) (Illus. opp. p. 26), Bur\r\nclover (_Medicago denticulata_), Spotted clover (_Medicago Arabica_) (p.\r\n67), Yellow trefoil or Hop clover (_Medicago lupulina_) (p. 26), and the\r\nDodders (_Cuscuta epithymum_ and _Cuscuta arvensis_), (pp. 45 and 47).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Yellow Trefoil Pods=\r\n\r\nThe pods of Yellow trefoil are shaped as here shown and contain but a\r\nsingle seed. Magnified four diameters]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Alfalfa Seed Pods=\r\n\r\nAlfalfa has a spiral pod of two or three turns, often containing five or\r\nsix seeds.

No. 142) are exceedingly interesting. In\r\nfifteen samples bought, each of one dollar’s worth, the quantity of pure\r\ngerminable seed was found to range from 5.1 to 9.3 pounds; the number of\r\nnoxious seeds found in a dollar’s worth of that bought as alfalfa seed\r\nranged from 360 to 185,940. Seven of the fifteen one-dollar samples each\r\ncarried more than 23,000 noxious seeds.\r\n\r\nSeed bought at $7.80 per bushel showed as low as 61.2 per cent that was\r\ngerminable, of which the _actual_ cost was $12.74 per bushel. None of\r\nthe fifteen samples had less than 77 per cent of germinable seed. One\r\npound sample contained 21,728 noxious seeds, of which 18,144 were\r\nlamb’s-quarter or pigweeds; the same pound also had 3126 seeds of\r\ndodder. Another pound carried 6420 seeds of crab grass, and one had 3325\r\nseeds of foxtail.\r\n\r\nThe station authorities recommend that no alfalfa seed be sown until\r\ncarefully screened through a screen fine enough to remove dodder seeds.\r\nWire sieves or screens with twenty meshes to the inch are found to serve\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nADULTERANTS DESCRIBED AND ILLUSTRATED\r\n\r\nAs a further and more thorough discussion of the frequent adulterants,\r\nProf. H. F. Roberts, botanist of the Kansas experiment station, has\r\nkindly prepared, with illustrations, for this volume the quoted\r\nstatements which follow here:\r\n\r\n“The immense and steadily increasing value of alfalfa as a forage crop\r\nin the United States, and the high price of the seed, make the securing\r\nof sound, pure seed a matter of supreme importance to farmers, and\r\nrender it equally important for them to be able to recognize, by sight,\r\nthe presence in alfalfa seed of the adulterants and seeds of certain\r\nweeds most commonly known to occur. There is conclusive evidence that an\r\namount of adulteration and substitution is actually practiced with\r\nalfalfa seed. It is usually charged that this is done abroad,\r\nespecially, as is alleged, in Germany.\r\n\r\n“The writer has been informed that, to a limited extent, the practice\r\nexists in America. The chief adulterant used is the seed of the Yellow\r\ntrefoil, or, as it is sometimes called, Hop clover or Black medick. (See\r\nillustrations opposite pages 26 and 32.) About fifty species of plants\r\nare known as ‘medicks’ or, scientifically, _Medicago_; but it so happens\r\nthat the only perennial species among them is alfalfa, which goes under\r\nthe botanical name of _Medicago sativa_, (p. 1). Other species such as\r\nYellow trefoil (_Medicago lupulina_) (p. 38) and Bur clover (_Medicago\r\ndenticulata_,) while they possess some forage value and are useful to a\r\nlimited extent, lack, for the most part, the lush, abundant growth of\r\nalfalfa itself, and are notably inferior through the fact of their\r\nannual habit. It is because of its perennial nature, therefore, as well\r\nas on account of its rank, succulent growth, that no species of annual\r\nleguminous plant can hope to compete with alfalfa for a moment in\r\nimportance. This means, then, that any substitute for alfalfa seed, or\r\nadulteration of it with the seed of another related species, such as\r\nYellow trefoil or Bur clover, is distinctly a fraud of serious\r\ncharacter, despite the fact that the adulterants are plants that make\r\nfair pasturage and have some forage value. They are merely annuals,\r\nending their life with the season, whereas a field of alfalfa should\r\nlive twenty years or more, under right conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHIEF ADULTERANT\r\n\r\n“At present, as stated, Yellow trefoil is the chief adulterant used in\r\nAmerican alfalfa seed. A number of cases, indeed, of complete or almost\r\ncomplete substitution of Yellow trefoil for alfalfa seed have come to\r\nthe writer’s attention within the past year. It is important, therefore,\r\nfor farmers to know the characteristic marks of distinction between the\r\nseed of alfalfa and of its chief adulterants. What are the chief\r\ncharacteristics of alfalfa seed? Facing page 13 are samples of pure\r\nalfalfa seed, photographed under a magnification of five diameters. It\r\nwill be noted that seeds of three general types exist: (1) A\r\nkidney-shaped type, marked ‘a’ in the illustration; (2) a type in which\r\none end terminates in an acute wedge, marked ‘e’; and (3) a type that is\r\nround or nearly so, marked ‘b’. These types clearly illustrated,\r\narranged for comparison in parallel rows are shown opposite page 44. See\r\nalso page 27. It should be noticed that type 2 is the most\r\ncharacteristic and frequent, and that the perfectly round type is\r\nextremely rare. This angular slant toward one tip of the seed is found\r\nnowhere among any of the adulterants. Neither does the kidney shape of\r\nseed occur, except in Bur clover; and, in that case, the difference in\r\nthe size of the seeds of the two species is sufficient to distinguish\r\nthem, in most instances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yellow Trefoil: Black Medic: Hop Clover (_Medicago\r\nlupulina_)]\r\n\r\n“It is when we consider the round or roundish type of alfalfa seed that\r\nthere is difficulty in distinguishing from alfalfa the seeds of Yellow\r\ntrefoil and of Sweet clover (illus. opp. p. 26), which latter frequently\r\noccurs as a weed seed, and possibly in some cases in sufficient quantity\r\nto be suspected as an adulterant. By comparison of the seeds of alfalfa\r\nwith the two adulterants just mentioned, (p. 26) the resemblances and\r\ndifferences of the three species will become evident. In general the\r\nseeds of Yellow trefoil are shorter and rounder than those of alfalfa,\r\nthe largest seeds of trefoil measuring 0.0629 inch wide by 0.0897 inch\r\nlong; whereas the largest alfalfa seeds measure 0.0653 inch wide by\r\n0.1153 inch long; so that the largest alfalfa seeds are a trifle wider\r\nand more than a third again as long as the largest trefoil seeds. The\r\nsmallest seeds of Yellow trefoil are usually plumper and shorter than\r\nthose of alfalfa (0.0511 inch wide by 0.0291 inch long, as compared with\r\n0.0496 inch wide by 0.0751 inch long in alfalfa); nevertheless, among\r\nboth the small and the large seeds, so far as the criterion of size\r\ngoes, individuals occur that equally well belong to either species, and\r\nthe average differences in size are not so great as the differences\r\nfound on comparing the largest and the smallest seeds of the two\r\nspecies, the average for the trefoil being 0.0574 inch by 0.0799 inch,\r\nand for alfalfa 0.0582 inch by 0.0944 inch. So it will be seen at once\r\nthat while trefoil seeds as a rule are smaller, shorter and rounder than\r\nthose of alfalfa, the rule is transgressed by many individuals. We must,\r\ntherefore, turn to the form and general outline of the seed. A farmer\r\ncan detect at once an attempt to substitute wholly Yellow trefoil for\r\nalfalfa seed by the fact that _in no case will the kidney-shaped or the\r\nregular-pointed types of seed be found in trefoil, whereas these always\r\noccur in alfalfa_. (Illustrated opp p. 26.)\r\n\r\n“In the more common cases, where adulteration rather than complete\r\nsubstitution is practiced, detection is more difficult--is practically\r\nimpossible, in fact, without the aid of a lens or magnifying glass\r\nhaving a power of about fifteen diameters. There are many seeds of\r\ntrefoil which can scarcely be distinguished from certain rounded seeds\r\nof alfalfa. Generally, however, the trefoil seed has a little projection\r\nor “beak” on the middle line of the seed, just back of the scar marking\r\nwhere the seed was attached to the pod. This is rarely found in alfalfa.\r\n\r\n“Bur clover as an adulterant is probably not so frequently used as\r\nYellow trefoil, since the larger size of its seed renders detection\r\neasy. Were it not for this fact, Bur clover would be a most effective\r\nadulterant, because its seeds resemble those of alfalfa more closely\r\nthan do those of Yellow trefoil. There are, of course, smaller seeds of\r\nBur clover and larger seeds of alfalfa that approximate each other in\r\nsize, but the average Bur clover seeds measure 0.0604 inch by 0.1188\r\ninch, as compared with an average for alfalfa of only 0.0582 inch by\r\n0.0944 inch.\r\n\r\n“So far as the plants of Yellow trefoil and Bur clover are concerned,\r\nthey are easily distinguishable from alfalfa. Both are of lower growth,\r\nas a rule, than alfalfa. Both have wider leaflets, which, in Bur clover,\r\nare like broad, inverted wedges. The flowers of these plants are yellow,\r\nand are borne in scanty clusters. The pods are wholly unlike those of\r\nalfalfa. Alfalfa has a spiral pod of two or three turns (p. 32),\r\ncontaining as many as five or six seeds. Yellow trefoil has a straight\r\npod (p. 32), containing but one seed. Bur clover has a coiled pod (p.\r\n33), but covered with bristly projections that give the plant its name.\r\nWhere adulteration or substitution is practiced, some of the pods are\r\nvery apt to occur in the bulk seed, and they can then easily be\r\nidentified and distinguished from those of alfalfa.\r\n\r\n“Seed of Sweet clover seems to occur frequently in western-grown alfalfa\r\nseed (p. 26). Sweet clover (illustrated in this book) grows to a height\r\nfrequently of from four to six feet, bearing small, white flowers on\r\nslender spikes three or four inches long. Unfortunately, and unlike\r\nYellow trefoil and Bur clover, Sweet clover is generally rejected by\r\nstock. On this account, it is a plant of no generally established value\r\nfor hay or as pasture, although, in some instances, it is successfully\r\nused. The seeds of Sweet clover are of a golden yellow when ripe; those\r\nof alfalfa, trefoil and Bur clover being greenish yellow. The seed coat\r\nof Sweet clover seed is covered with minute elevations, while alfalfa\r\nseed is smooth. The seeds of Sweet clover (p. 26) are rounder and\r\nplumper than those of alfalfa, and have a very pronounced groove between\r\nthe main body of the seed and the ridge which marks the location of the\r\nrootlet of the young plant within. It is this ridge that in alfalfa\r\nseeds runs off, as a rule, in a marked slant, but which in both trefoil\r\nand Sweet clover, especially in the latter, forms a well-rounded curve\r\nto the tip of the seed. No pointed or kidney-shaped seeds are ever seen\r\nin Sweet clover. (See illus. opp. p. 26.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMMON WEED IN IMPORTED ALFALFA SEED\r\n\r\n“It remains to mention the most common weed found in imported alfalfa\r\nseed--the English or Ribbed plantain, or, as it is more generally called\r\nin the West, Buck-horn or Rib grass. It is a difficult weed to\r\neradicate, lots of seed containing any noticeable percentage of it\r\nshould be rejected. (See illus. opp. p. 13.)\r\n\r\n“The farmer is often to blame for the poor seed of which he makes\r\ncomplaint. Prime alfalfa seed is expensive, and a cheap grade will\r\ninevitably be poor in quality, containing much dead seed, rubbish, and\r\nthe seeds of many kinds of weeds. Where ‘cheap’ alfalfa seed is demanded\r\nit will always be sold, and buyers need not be surprised by its quality.\r\nOn the other hand, there is no excuse or palliation for the offense of\r\nselling, under the name and at the price of standard alfalfa seed, seed\r\nof substituted species. It is the duty of seed dealers to ascertain\r\nbeforehand the character and genuineness of seed that they sell under\r\nany given name, and this applies to the retailers as well as to the\r\nwholesale dealers. On the other hand, farmers cannot expect to obtain\r\nthe best seed unless they are willing to pay the price it brings.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDODDER SEED\r\n\r\nDodder seeds are somewhat smaller than alfalfa seeds (pp. 45 and 47),\r\nbut are not separated from them except by careful recleaning;\r\nconsequently, they are often sown along with the alfalfa seed,\r\nespecially in that which has been imported. If a field is badly\r\ninfested, it should be plowed up and devoted to some other crop for a\r\nfew years. Prof. F. H. Hillman of Nevada (Bul. No. 47) says there are\r\nseveral kinds that infest alfalfa, but two kinds are especially common\r\nand destructive in this country. _Cuscuta epithymum_ is the commoner.\r\n“The seeds of this (p. 47) are very small, and are almost sure to escape\r\ndetection on casual examination of the samples; yet, once recognized\r\nunder the lens, their presence may be easily discovered. They are so\r\nmuch smaller than alfalfa seeds that the use of a sieve of twenty meshes\r\nper inch separates them from the latter when only free dodder seeds are\r\npresent. Not only are various other small weed seeds disposed of in the\r\nprocess, but little if any alfalfa seed worth buying is lost. The few\r\nripened flowers of dodder retaining matured seeds, which sometimes pass\r\nthe thresher uninjured, may be removed by proper fanning. It is safe to\r\nsay that no purchaser of alfalfa seed can afford to neglect sifting his\r\nseed carefully with a twenty-mesh sieve, which is the mesh the writer\r\nrecommends for the separation of this kind of dodder from alfalfa seed.\r\n\r\n“_Cuscuta arvensis_ is another dodder as destructive when once\r\nestablished. Its seeds (p. 47) seem to be less common, however. They are\r\nlarger than the preceding, many of them being practically the same size\r\nas the smaller, more rounded alfalfa seeds, which they often strikingly\r\nresemble. Thus they are hard to detect, and cannot be removed without\r\nthe loss of much small alfalfa seed. This should be the more dreaded of\r\nthe two dodders, because alfalfa seed infested with seeds of _Cuscuta\r\nepithymum_ can be made practically free from them with comparatively\r\nlittle loss and expense. Not so, however, with seed containing _Cuscuta\r\narvensis_, which should not be purchased at any price. Dodder seeds can\r\nscarcely be regarded as an adulterant, yet as an impurity they are very\r\ncommon and most objectionable.” (See illustrations opp. pp. 45, 46 and\r\n47.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER V._\r\n\r\nSoil and Seeding\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATE, YET UNIFORM\r\n\r\nIn this double title we have a case of the widest variations and the\r\nmost positive and rigid uniformity. Alfalfa may be grown in almost every\r\npossible kind of soil and under almost all soil conditions (save two),\r\nbut omitting these the seeding, including the tilth of the ground, is\r\nbased, so far as any future success is concerned, on perfect\r\ncultivation. The dictum, “Alfalfa must have a dry, warm, sandy loam,\r\nvery rich” has become obsolete, as already pointed out.\r\n\r\nThere are just two soil conditions that seem absolutely against the\r\ngrowth of alfalfa. The first is a soil constantly wet. The common\r\nremark, “Alfalfa will not stand ‘wet feet’,” seems to be the expression\r\nof a law. It does not do well where the water is nearer to the surface\r\nthan six feet, or where in winter water will stand on the ground for\r\nover forty-eight hours. This invariably smothers the plants; in fact it\r\nusually kills any crop. If water flows over the field for some such\r\ntime, due to a freshet, the alfalfa is often found uninjured if too much\r\nsoil has not been deposited on and around the plants. Even in such\r\ninstances fields have been saved by a disking once or twice, but it is\r\nwholly unwise to sow on a field subject to overflow, or one where water\r\nrises to the surface in winter or spring; likewise on a field so flat\r\nthat water will not run off in time of a heavy rain or promptly drain\r\nout through the sub-surface. The time is rapidly coming everywhere when\r\nthe intelligent farmer will not try to raise any crop on such a field,\r\nundrained. The alfalfa roots will find their way to moisture if given\r\nthe right surface conditions. There are profitable alfalfa meadows in\r\nparts of Kansas where it is eighty feet to water, but there has not yet\r\nbeen found one that is prosperous where water comes close to the\r\nsurface, or where it stands on the ground in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Three General Types of Alfalfa Seed=\r\n\r\nThe right-hand column, kidney-shaped, a characteristic form, but not so\r\ncommon as the type in the central column.

This is often the case where corn and wheat\r\nhave been raised for many years, thus robbing the soil of much lime; a\r\ncondition that may be remedied by an application of lime to the land\r\njust before sowing the alfalfa, harrowing it in beforehand or, if the\r\nseed is to be broadcasted, the lime may be applied just before sowing,\r\nwhen once harrowing will suffice for both, or it may be sown with a\r\ndrill--500 to 1000 pounds per acre.\r\n\r\nA simple test for acidity is to make a deep cut in the ground with a\r\nknife, pressing the earth slightly apart; then push a piece of litmus\r\npaper into the opening and press the earth together. Leave the paper\r\nthere for a few hours. If upon examination the litmus paper has a pink\r\nappearance it is proof of acidity, and this, as already said, may best\r\nbe remedied with lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL PREPARATION\r\n\r\nWith the only two negative points considered, the more important\r\nconditions upon which success will depend may be discussed. One chief\r\nessential is the advance preparation. Many of the most successful\r\ngrowers begin their preparations two or three years before they sow the\r\nseed. There must be, by rights, the most perfect physical condition of\r\nthe soil. It should have been plowed deep for at least two years, and in\r\nmost fields in the central and northern states a two- or three-inch\r\nsubsoiling along with a seven- or eight-inch plowing will be very\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nIf corn is to precede a spring sowing, the ground should have a liberal\r\ndressing of stable manure plowed under for humus, to encourage\r\nearthworms and to introduce the particular bacteria so essential to\r\nalfalfa’s welfare or at least furnish favorable conditions for bacteria,\r\nand the harrow should follow the plow each day. The soil’s condition\r\nshould be like that for a garden. Care should be taken never to work\r\nwith the ground when too wet, as such working almost inevitably results\r\nin clods and baked soil. The corn should be cultivated often, and a\r\nliberal sowing of cowpeas just before the last cultivation, which should\r\nbe shallow, has been found quite helpful. This crop will repress and\r\ntake the place of weeds, furnish a rich food for fattening pigs or lambs\r\nafter the corn is cut, add fertility to the soil, and also introduce\r\nbacteria similar to the bacteria for the alfalfa. The cowpea, being a\r\nlegume, prepares the way for alfalfa, its near relative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dodder Plant on an Alfalfa Stem]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Dodder=, (_Cuscuta arvensis_)\r\n\r\n(a) A group of seeds (enlarged), showing the prevailing forms; (a, b,\r\nand c) individual seeds having somewhat the form of clover seeds; (d) a\r\ngroup showing the natural size]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alfalfa and Dodder Seed.

If corn is husked from the fields, the stalks should not be\r\npastured except when the ground is fully frozen. Later they should be\r\nthoroughly broken, raked and burned, to leave the land in the best\r\ncondition for spring work. If the corn is cut and fodder hauled off, the\r\nstubs should be broken in cold weather by a pole or other drag, and\r\nraked and burned as recommended for the stalks. This adapts the ground\r\nfor disking and harrowing early in March. Then every ten days the field\r\nshould be disked or harrowed to conserve moisture, to start weeds and\r\nthen kill them, and to bring the ground into the desirable tilth.\r\nOrdinarily, in the central states, sowing may be done early in April,\r\nwhile in the South this may be done by the middle of March, and in\r\nWisconsin and Canada by the last of April or early May, although the\r\ndates are variable. Many report seeding in Kansas the middle of May,\r\nobtaining a clipping in July and a hay crop in September. Others report\r\nsowing in March and cutting a hay crop in June. Some Wisconsin reports\r\nsay that the first of June is early enough, while others in that state\r\nand in Minnesota prefer to sow two or three weeks earlier, and still\r\nothers in Wisconsin sow in April. The important things to keep in mind\r\nare to have the soil right and the weeds disposed of, and to sow when\r\nthe weather and moisture and conditions are right. Alfalfa is a child of\r\nthe sun; permanent shade from any source is its enemy, and when young it\r\nis not a good fighter against adversaries of any sort. More failures\r\nare due to weeds than to any other one cause, and unfortunately all the\r\nweeds do not grow on the land of the farmer who is shiftless or\r\nneglectful. The latter is so benevolent as to permit his weeds to\r\nscatter their seeds to the fields of his neighbors.\r\n\r\nIf a spring sowing is to be made on wheat ground, the land will be\r\nhelped by a liberal dressing of manure immediately after the harvest,\r\nand by plowing and harrowing at once; then sowing about the last of\r\nAugust to rye or wheat for fall and winter pasturage, and to prevent the\r\nsoil from leaching or washing. In the spring the land should be disked\r\nand harrowed for alfalfa, keeping in mind the point emphasized in the\r\npreceding paragraph. Instead of the rye or wheat, cowpeas may be sowed\r\nafter the wheat harvest; thus both fertility and bacteria will be added\r\nto the soil, and the farmer have a valuable pasture crop for pigs or\r\nlambs. If the season is extremely favorable, a hay crop may be cut in\r\nearly October.\r\n\r\nIf potatoes are to precede a spring sowing of alfalfa, more than usual\r\ncare should be taken to keep the field clean of weeds. Some farmers do\r\nwell by sowing millet with the last cultivation of potatoes, leaving the\r\npotatoes in the ground until after the millet is harvested, and when the\r\ncrop is dug the land is free from weeds. Then it may be harrowed or\r\ndisked and seeded to rye for winter pasture. Some plow the potato ground\r\nin the fall and sow to wheat or rye. Certainly if weeds are present the\r\nground should be plowed as soon as the potatoes are dug. The idea is to\r\nsecure a fine seed bed and have the ground free from weeds, the great\r\ncurse of the American farm. All things considered there is probably no\r\ncrop which leaves the soil in finer physical condition for\r\nalfalfa-sowing than millet, and none that is more unsatisfactory for a\r\nlike purpose than sorghum or Kafir corn that was planted in hills or\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nA clover sod for a spring sowing should be plowed in September or\r\nOctober, disked or harrowed, and not infrequently a light sowing of rye\r\nfor winter pasture is feasible. In early spring use disk and tooth\r\nharrows on the land. It is excellent if a liberal application of rotted\r\nstable manure is plowed under with the clover sod. Usually it is better\r\nto follow clover with a corn or potato crop before seeding to alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL SOWING\r\n\r\nFall sowing presents fewer difficulties than spring sowing. Corn is not\r\nthe preceding crop and hence the weed problem is not so formidable.\r\nUsually a fall sowing follows millet or oats, cowpeas or potatoes.\r\nAlmost any crop except the sorghums may be grown to precede alfalfa for\r\na fall sowing; these should not be as they consume too much moisture. If\r\npossible, put on a dressing of stable manure the preceding winter; plow\r\ndeep in the spring and work to a fine tilth for the summer crop.\r\nSouth of the latitude of 40 degrees cowpeas is one of the best\r\npreparatory crops. They are legumes, and the bacteria that live on their\r\nroots are similar to those upon the alfalfa roots; they are also\r\nnitrogen-gatherers, taking nitrogen from the air as does the alfalfa,\r\nand thus they prepare the soil for alfalfa. Besides, cowpeas are a\r\nvaluable forage, the hay being worth almost as much, pound for pound, as\r\nthat of alfalfa. When cut off they leave the ground ready for disking\r\nand other preparation. Millet is also excellent for this purpose,\r\nleaving the soil unusually friable. Potatoes make a satisfactory\r\npreparatory crop, but the danger from them too often is neglect to keep\r\nthe weeds down. As soon as the land is free, it should be disked and\r\nharrowed, and this repeated about every ten days until the time for\r\nsowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT PLOWING NOT DESIRABLE\r\n\r\nIt is seen that plowing for alfalfa just preceding the seeding is not\r\nrecommended. Plowing leaves the sub-surface too loose, thus depriving\r\nthe roots of a sufficiently firm footing and making a full sowing more\r\nliable to harm from freezing and thawing, and the spring sowing to harm\r\nfrom a dry summer. The necessity of the most perfect surface conditions\r\ncannot be to often emphasized, and this too includes considerable\r\ncompactness rather than a too light or ashy condition. There must be no\r\nclods, no stiff and stubborn humps.\r\n\r\nIf alfalfa is to follow clover, and to be seeded in the fall, the sod\r\nshould be broken early after the clover is harvested and each day’s\r\nplowing harrowed that day; then the field disked and cross-disked and\r\nharrowed again. After that it should be disked, lapping half, every ten\r\nor fifteen days until time for seeding. Alfalfa may follow timothy if\r\nthe sod is not too old and stubborn, and it may be treated the same as\r\nclover sod.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCE BACTERIA BY PREPARATORY SOWING\r\n\r\nAnother form of preparation followed by many successful growers, men who\r\ndo not complain about alfalfa not doing well “here,” is the sowing of a\r\nfew pounds of alfalfa seed on the field two or three years before it is\r\nintended to sow for a permanent crop. Mr. Joseph E. Wing, of central\r\nwestern Ohio, a widely known farmer, stockman, and writer on matters\r\nagricultural, uses alfalfa in a regular rotation, and two years before\r\nhe is ready to sow it on a given field as a main crop, sows clover and\r\ntimothy along with two or three pounds of alfalfa seed, for a pasture\r\ncrop. Thus the bacteria are introduced, and when the pasture is plowed\r\nfor the full sowing of alfalfa, the disking and harrowing that follow\r\ndistribute the bacteria throughout the soil, and the probabilities of a\r\ngood stand are greatly enhanced. He sometimes sows two or three pounds\r\nof alfalfa seed to the acre with a wheat crop two years before he is to\r\nsow the field entirely to alfalfa. Another, in a state where the\r\nexperiment station director still declares alfalfa-raising to be\r\ndoubtful, writes that he has not had a failure in a decade, and his plan\r\nis to precede alfalfa with winter wheat, sowing a little alfalfa seed\r\nwith the wheat, probably three pounds to the acre, and the next fall\r\nafter giving the land a thorough preparation he sows fifteen pounds of\r\nalfalfa seed to the acre. Another reports pleasing results in two\r\ndifferent fields by sowing in the spring five pounds of alfalfa seed\r\nwith clover; in two years the alfalfa stood thick on the ground, having\r\ncrowded out the clover. If these plans introduce the bacteria into the\r\nsoil, it may be wondered why it would not be equally helpful to sow two\r\nor three pounds of alfalfa seed per acre with the oats or millet in the\r\nspring, preparatory to the thorough seeding to alfalfa in the fall.\r\n\r\nAnother man, whose profit in raising alfalfa has been marked, reports\r\nthat his soil is very waxy and hard to deal with. He has met this\r\ntrouble by listing his ground in the fall and leaving it thus open for\r\nhard freezing throughout the winter. He then disks and cross-disks in\r\nthe spring, putting the soil in fine tilth, and sowing millet as a\r\npreparatory crop. He has occasionally sowed alfalfa in the spring,\r\nfollowing the fall listing and later freezing of his ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL CROPS DEMAND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nAlfalfa, like corn and cotton, demands certain conditions of the soil\r\nand certain constituents in that soil. Every crop demands its certain\r\nfoods. All crops except alfalfa and the other legumes obtain practically\r\nall their food, including nitrogen, from the soil. The latter crops use\r\nnitrogen but get it from the air. Alfalfa takes nitrogen from the soil\r\nonly during the first few months of its growth, and thereafter not only\r\ntakes its own necessary supply from the air, but a large surplus which\r\nit stores in the soil, available for whatever crop may follow. Other\r\ncrops take much nitrogen from the soil, but contribute nothing to its\r\nenrichment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING OR FALL SOWING--WHICH?\r\n\r\nThis has been a much argued question with experimenters. Possibly it\r\nwill be found to be of minor importance in itself, depending more upon\r\nother conditions than the season. From the northern tier of states many\r\nreports favor spring sowing, yet from each come letters in favor of fall\r\nsowing. Several experiment stations in the South are in favor of spring\r\nsowing, yet report satisfactory results from fall seeding. It seems\r\npretty well established, however, that fall sowing is safer in the\r\ncentral latitude states, say including Ohio, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas,\r\nColorado and Utah, and states within the same parallels.\r\n\r\nIn other states prevailing opinions favor spring sowing. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen all conditions are understood, fall sowing seems likely to become\r\nthe established practice throughout the United States. This is in line\r\nwith the system for the more staple crops and common rotation; it gives\r\nopportunity to bring the ground into better condition; the preparation\r\nand sowing come at the most convenient season, and one of relatively\r\ngreater leisure; there is less interruption by unfavorable weather; the\r\nsoil, responding more readily to surface cultivation, permits the work\r\nto be done with less danger of surface water retarding normal root\r\ndevelopment, and the annual weeds being dead they cannot interfere with\r\nthe first growth of the alfalfa. Sown in the fall, with time to secure\r\nsome growth for winter protection, alfalfa will be ready to respond to\r\nthe first call of spring, and for the mower early in June. Moreover, if\r\nit fails from freezing or other cause, little crop-time is lost. The\r\nfarmer has but to disk and harrow in April or early May, and sow half as\r\nmuch seed as he sowed in the fall, and he will have prospect of a\r\ncutting in eighty or ninety days, at an expenditure of but few pounds of\r\nseed and a little labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISADVANTAGES OF SPRING SOWING\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, if a farmer sows in the spring, he has his old enemy, the\r\nweeds, to contend with. If the season be damp and cloudy, the alfalfa\r\nmay not grow fast, but weeds will. Therefore, June may see him mowing to\r\nretard a rampant growth of weeds instead of gathering a profitable\r\ncutting of prime hay. It is not improbable that he may be doing the same\r\nin July or in September, thus losing a whole season. Again, the spring\r\npreparation comes when the farmer needs to be working his corn and\r\npotato land; hence he is likely to slight or neglect the careful\r\npreparation of the alfalfa ground and so do a poor job, with, in such\r\ncases, the usual result of a “poor stand.” Then too, the frequent rains\r\ninterfere with regular disking and harrowing and the weeds may obtain a\r\nstart the farmer cannot check. In most cases fall sowing means three\r\ncuttings the following year. In many instances spring sowing means no\r\ncrop the first season, although better farming will gain a September\r\ncrop, while the best farming, with no weeds, may give two if not three\r\ncrops; not heavy ones, perhaps, but of no inconsiderable value.\r\n\r\nCommenting on spring sowing in the more northern states, Henry Wallace,\r\neditor of _Wallaces’ Farmer_, says:\r\n\r\n“Our own experience in growing alfalfa both in Nebraska and Iowa has\r\ntaught us that it is a waste of time and labor to sow in the spring. If\r\nsown in the spring without a nurse crop, it will have to be mowed twice,\r\nprobably three times, to keep down the weeds, and even then it will not\r\nbe in as good condition as if a crop of early corn or even oats was\r\ntaken off, and the ground put in fine condition and seeded in August.\r\n\r\n“In 1904 we sowed in the spring 250 acres of alfalfa on our Nebraska\r\nfarm, and some twenty or thirty acres of it was washed in ridges by a\r\nvery heavy rain immediately after. We reseeded the vacant spaces in the\r\nfall and later could see no difference between the fall sowing and the\r\nspring sowing. We did the same thing on one of our Iowa farms, sowing in\r\nthe spring and mowing three times. Another piece was sowed in August.\r\nThe August sowing was much better than the spring sowing. It should be\r\nsaid, however, that the land was richer and the difference was therefore\r\nnot all due to the time of sowing. So long as Kansas farmers continued\r\nto sow their alfalfa in the spring they had but partial success, owing\r\nto the fact that Crab grass and other grasses will come up in the early\r\nfall and smother out the spring sowing. By using some other crop the\r\nfirst part of the season, then putting the land in fine condition in the\r\nmonth of August or even by September 1st, an alfalfa crop can be started\r\nwhich will have a strong enough growth to smother out the weeds the next\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n“We don’t know that we would insist on this so strongly for northern\r\nIowa and Minnesota, but certainly from the latitude of the Northwestern\r\nrailroad in Iowa, south, and corresponding latitude in other states, we\r\nwould abandon spring sowing and sow alfalfa on well prepared ground in\r\nAugust. We would not, however, plow the ground for this fall sowing, but\r\nput the soil in first-class condition for a spring crop, then use a disk\r\nand harrow for the fall preparation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDING BY DRILL OR BROADCAST?\r\n\r\nHere too, there is a variety of opinions, all based on experience. Those\r\nwho object most to drills may have used poor implements, with feeding\r\ngears not well regulated, or possibly they have not known how to use the\r\ndrills. Many who object to the broadcast method have had little training\r\nor skill in it. It is reasonable to suppose, however, that given soil in\r\nfine tilth, and a good drill rightly adjusted, there will be a more\r\neven, and hence a more economical distribution and a better and more\r\nuniform covering of the seed. It is also claimed that drilling secures a\r\nmore uniform distribution of soil moisture. The general opinion is that\r\nby sowing with a drill, properly regulated, one can safely use five\r\npounds less of seed per acre. Some alfalfa raisers use a wheelbarrow\r\nseeder; others use a kind of swing seeder strapped to the sower’s body;\r\nstill others, who have had training in the old-fashioned method of\r\nbroadcasting, declare it the best, but the experiment stations of\r\npractically all the states, and most up-to-date farmers, favor the use\r\nof the press drill. There are now on the market different types of\r\nalfalfa seeders which can be attached or are already attached to the\r\nordinary grain drill, and that will distribute the seed in any desired\r\nquantities per acre with broadcast effect or leave it in drill rows as\r\nmay be preferred. At the Kansas Experiment Station success has followed\r\nbroadcasting, and cross-drilling gave no particular advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MUCH SEED TO THE ACRE?\r\n\r\nReports of seed sown, varying from six to sixty pounds to the acre,\r\nindicate much ignorance of the nature of the alfalfa plant; or a great\r\nrecklessness and extravagance. Twenty pounds to the acre, if all seeds\r\ngerminated, would mean 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 plants, whereas a stand of\r\n500,000 is ample. Most of the experiment stations favor twenty to thirty\r\npounds to the acre, although several experts at these stations insist\r\nthat fifteen pounds of clean, germinable seed to the acre is as much as\r\nshould be sowed. Even if these all grew it would give nearly 44 plants\r\nto the foot square of land, or four to five times as many as would\r\nthrive after two years old. Of course the quantity may depend upon a\r\nvariety of circumstances, such as the vitality of the seed, condition of\r\nthe surface soil, condition of the subsoil as to moisture, the method of\r\nsowing, weather conditions at the time of sowing or immediately after,\r\nalso the natural fertility of the soil and the bacterial life present,\r\nor at least the conditions for propagating or sustaining bacterial life.\r\nWith land prepared by sowing a few pounds of seed six months or a year\r\npreceding, with a heavy application of stable manure plowed under six\r\nmonths before, perfect soil preparation, normal moisture, and clean\r\nseed, testing ninety per cent germinable, there should be no need for\r\nmore than ten pounds to the acre. Disking that the field should have\r\nlater will split the crowns and many new stalks will be sent up; so that\r\nin a few years a square foot of surface will not accommodate more than\r\nsix to ten robust, vigorous plants, and having these the ideal stand has\r\npretty nearly been attained. One plant has been known to send out as\r\nmany as 360 branches from its single main root, resembling in form a\r\nspreading bush. A successful farmer in Geary county, Kansas, who has\r\nbeen raising alfalfa for twenty years, seldom sows more than six pounds\r\nof seed to the acre and never more than ten. A prominent Ohio farmer\r\nusually sows but ten, and never over twelve or fifteen pounds to the\r\nacre, although he has always introduced alfalfa bacteria into the soil\r\none or two years before ready to give it a full seeding. Of strictly\r\ngood seed, well cleaned, twelve pounds would likely be too much rather\r\nthan too little, other conditions being right.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH OR WITHOUT A NURSE CROP?\r\n\r\nThe practice of sowing a nurse crop with alfalfa was inaugurated when\r\nthe nature of the plant was not as well understood as now. It was also\r\nsomewhat on the theory too that “a half-loaf is better than no bread.”\r\nIt began when there was a good deal of doubt about “getting a stand,”\r\nand the farmer thought no doubt that a crop of oats or barley would pay\r\nfor the plowing even if the alfalfa failed. While the practice is\r\ncontinued by many, the prevalent later method is to provide no nurse\r\ncrop. Few who have abandoned the nurse crop have returned to it. The\r\nalfalfa plant does not need protection from the sun, nor is it bettered\r\nby dividing any of the soil moisture or fertility with those of another\r\ncrop. On the other hand, if alfalfa is sowed in the spring, it is\r\nimportant that it obtain an early start in order that its roots can\r\nquickly work their way down into the moisture of the subsoil, against\r\nthe dry days of July and August. When a nurse crop of any vigor is\r\nremoved the alfalfa plants are likely to be found weak, spindling and\r\nwith little root growth; the nurse crop also has taken up some of the\r\nsoil nitrogen needed by the young alfalfa; or if the nurse crop is\r\nheavy and has lodged, there will be left bare spots, where the alfalfa\r\nhas been smothered out.\r\n\r\nCutting the nurse crop is likely to be attended with no little damage to\r\nthe tender alfalfa plants by trampling their crowns into the ground, or\r\nby breaking them off. Practically all the experiment stations favor\r\nsowing alone. With few exceptions the second and third years have\r\nbrought heavier yields where no nurse crop was used. The theory that the\r\nnurse crop will prevent the weeds choking the alfalfa is apparently, as\r\na rule, not well founded. In the first place alfalfa should not be sown\r\non foul land, and in the second place proper disking and harrowing, at\r\nnear intervals for four or six weeks before sowing, will disturb or kill\r\nfar more weeds than can any nurse crop. Besides, the oats or barley sown\r\nas a nurse will when cut leave weeds in good growth, or dormant and\r\nready to spring up as fast or faster than the alfalfa. No nurse crop is\r\never used with fall sowing. When ground has been thoroughly prepared for\r\nthe preceding crop, and then properly cared for, and made ready for the\r\nalfalfa by the preliminary weed destruction, it will be found advisable\r\nto sow alfalfa alone, even in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nINOCULATING THE SOIL\r\n\r\nIt has been found where alfalfa shows thrifty vigor, is making a good\r\nstand, and is at least two years old, that on the roots are little\r\nnodules or wart-like protuberances. On fields where the alfalfa is\r\nunthrifty or failing to make a good stand, examination will probably\r\nfail to discover any of these nodules. Scientists tell us that these\r\nnodules are the homes of bacteria, microscopic vegetable organisms\r\nobtaining their sustenance from the nitrogen of the air and the starch\r\nof the plant; that they collect much more nitrogen than they need, the\r\nover-supply being taken up by the alfalfa, which, after these nodules\r\nare formed and occupied, takes no more nitrogen from the soil, but\r\nannually stores about its roots more from the air, thus adding to the\r\nnitrogen supply in the soil instead of taking from it as do all other\r\nfarm crops except the legumes. Each legume--clover, alfalfa, cowpeas,\r\netc.--has a distinct species of bacteria, or at least bacteria with a\r\ndistinct development, excepting, as has been found, that Sweet clover\r\n(_Melilotus alba_) and Bur clover (_Medicago denticulata_) develop the\r\nsame species as does alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUYING INFECTED SOIL\r\n\r\nSeveral methods of preparing land for alfalfa by introducing its\r\npeculiar bacteria have been suggested, and practiced to some extent.\r\nMany farmers and experimenters have used with success infected soil upon\r\ntheir lands; soil from established alfalfa fields, or that from along\r\nthe roads or creeks where the Sweet clover or Bur clover has been\r\ngrowing. This soil is spread upon the field or sown with alfalfa just\r\nbefore the seeding. If the drill is to be used the inoculated soil is\r\nspread on and harrowed in. If the seed is to be broadcasted, the\r\ninfected soil may be harrowed in with the seed. It is better, however,\r\nto harrow this infected soil in thoroughly before seeding. Experiment\r\nstations recommend an application of two hundred pounds of such soil to\r\nevery acre, but good results have been secured from half that quantity.\r\nThis will depend very much upon the nature of the soil, and the subsoil\r\nespecially. Many fields seem to have these bacteria waiting for the\r\ncoming of alfalfa. Land that has been well manured and contains abundant\r\nhumus, and land that is light and friable will usually respond to the\r\nbacterial life attached to the alfalfa seed. Most farmers who have\r\nestablished fields will sell soil to their neighbors, which should be\r\nfrom the top six or eight inches, and include roots, stubble and earth.\r\nBoth Sweet clover and Bur clover are found in almost every neighborhood\r\nin the northern states, while the latter is very general in the South.\r\n\r\nSome alfalfa raisers make a business of selling and shipping inoculated\r\nsoil. Probably any experiment station will ship small quantities to\r\nfarmers within its state, at about the cost of digging, sacking and\r\ndelivering at the railroad station. Therefore, if a farmer desires to\r\nuse it, little labor or expense is attached to doing so. There is\r\nreason, however, to doubt the need of this method in any of the western\r\nor central western states where the suggestions mentioned in the first\r\npart of the chapter are closely followed. No doubt there are advantages\r\nin using it in most states east of the Mississippi river, in order to\r\nhasten the development of the bacteria and to make a good stand more\r\ncertain. Preparation one or two years in advance as already described,\r\nby a light sowing of alfalfa seed for introducing its peculiar bacteria,\r\nis less expensive, and requires less labor and carries no risk of\r\nintroducing the seeds of other clovers or weeds. Most farms have enough\r\nweed seeds already.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGERS OF INOCULATION BY SOIL TRANSFER\r\n\r\nTouching upon the dangers possibly resulting from inoculation by soil\r\ntransfer a bulletin from the United States Department of Agriculture has\r\nthis to suggest:\r\n\r\n“Satisfactory inoculations have been obtained by transferring soil from\r\nold fields on which the legume has been grown, but experience has shown\r\nthat there are dangers incident to such methods of soil transfer which\r\nit is wise to avoid.\r\n\r\n“The source of supply of such soil should be definitely known, and in no\r\ncase should soil be used from fields which have previously borne any\r\ncrop affected with a fungous disease, a bacterial disease, or with\r\nnematodes. Where a rotation of crops is practiced, it is often difficult\r\nto make sure of this factor, so that the method of soil transfer is,\r\nunder average circumstances, open to suspicion, if not to positive\r\nobjection. Numerous animal and plant parasites live in the soil for\r\nyears, and are already established in so many localities that it is\r\nmanifestly unwise to ship soil indiscriminately from one portion of the\r\ncountry to another.\r\n\r\n“The bacterial diseases of the tomato, potato, and egg plant, and the\r\nclub-root, brown rot, and wilt disease of the cabbage, all more or less\r\nwidely distributed, are readily transmitted in the soil; while in the\r\nSouth and West there are the wilt diseases of cotton, melons, sweet\r\npotatoes, cowpeas, and flax, and various nematoid and root-rot diseases\r\nwhich might easily become a serious menace over areas much larger than\r\nthey now occupy if deliberately spread by the careless use of soil for\r\ninoculation purposes. There are several insects and fungous diseases of\r\nclover to be avoided, and various diseases of beans and peas. There is\r\nalso a disease of alfalfa, the ‘leaf spot,’ which is causing damage in\r\nsome regions. These are only a few of many diseases liable to be\r\ntransmitted in soils. The farmer should therefore be on his guard. The\r\ndanger from such sources is by no means imaginary. The Department of\r\nAgriculture has had specific cases of such accidental distribution\r\nreported, and if the business of selling soil for inoculation is made to\r\nflourish by farmers purchasing without question ‘alfalfa soil,’ ‘cowpea\r\nsoil,’ etc., there is every reason to believe that experience will\r\ndemonstrate the folly of such haphazard methods.\r\n\r\n“Of scarcely less importance is the danger of disseminating noxious\r\nweeds and insect pests through this plan of inoculation by means of\r\nsoils. Even though weeds may not have been serious in the field, the\r\ngreat number of dormant seeds, requiring but a slight change in\r\nsurroundings to produce germination, is always a menace. The enormous\r\ndamage to crops caused by introduced insects and weeds should convey a\r\nwarning and lead to caution. It is not the part of good judgment to view\r\nthe risk as a slight one.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER METHODS OF INOCULATION\r\n\r\nThere are two or three better ways of inoculating land than by using a\r\nneighbor’s soil. Some alfalfa raisers recommend the sowing of alfalfa\r\nmeal with the seed. Another plan which appears reasonable and\r\npracticable is for the farmer who wishes to introduce alfalfa to buy\r\nalfalfa hay the year before and feed it to his live stock; then haul\r\nthe manure to the fields and plow it under for the crop to precede\r\nalfalfa. It is claimed by those who have done this that a satisfactory\r\nstand is well-nigh certain, other conditions being met. It can be said,\r\nhowever, that some high authorities on this crop, men who have\r\nexperimented on many different kinds of soil and who have succeeded\r\nunder varying conditions, declare that neither soil nor seed inoculation\r\nis necessary. It is altogether probable that if a field has been well\r\nfarmed for a few years previous to the alfalfa-sowing, with unusually\r\ngood cultivation the preceding year, a heavy application of stable\r\nmanure plowed under at least five months before, then given the proper\r\npreparation and seeding, using seed raised in about the same latitude\r\nand under similar conditions in which the new crop must grow, and with\r\nseed testing ninety per cent germinable, there should be little anxiety\r\nabout the need of inoculation. Of course old, worn-out land may require\r\nmore fertilizers, restoring to the soil not only necessary nitrogen that\r\nhas been exhausted by other crops, but also the potash and phosphorus.\r\nIn eastern states it has been found advantageous also to apply a very\r\nlight top-dressing of stable manure just before sowing the seed. If lime\r\nis deficient, that must be applied. An examination of any particular\r\nsoil will usually be made without charge by the state chemists, and the\r\nfarmer may thus approximately ascertain just what the soil will need for\r\nalfalfa, corn, or any other crop he may desire to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP ON TRYING\r\n\r\nIt is important to say to the eastern farmers, especially, that there is\r\nlittle difference between successful alfalfa-growing and the successful\r\ngrowing of other crops. Poor farming never brings big crops, nor will\r\npoor land produce as big yields as the more fertile. Failure to restore\r\nto the soil the necessary elements of which it has been robbed means the\r\nsame in New York, Kansas, Virginia, or anywhere else. Every farm plant,\r\nto prosper, must find in the soil, readily available, the elements\r\nneeded for its development. If a farmer finds the soil lacking in\r\nelements needed for certain crops, he should either apply the deficiency\r\nor not attempt their raising. This is true of corn or wheat, cotton, or\r\ntobacco, no less than alfalfa.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa needs especially nitrogen, potash and phosphorus. The average\r\nvirgin soil in the United States contains enough of these to last\r\nseveral hundred years. If there had been at all times an intelligent\r\nrotation of crops, these chemical elements would be found in just as\r\nlarge proportions in the soil that has been farmed a hundred years as in\r\nthe soil never cultivated. Hence, if after trying alfalfa a man meets\r\nwith failure, he should not stop, and say, “Alfalfa won’t grow ‘here’,”\r\nbut try it again _immediately_. If he discovers a seeming failure in\r\nMarch or April, he should disk and harrow and as early as possible sow\r\nabout ten pounds of seed to the acre; in many instances he will have to\r\nclip his alfalfa in about six or eight weeks and can mow a crop of hay\r\nin September, or possibly two hay crops in the season. There have been\r\nvarious cases reported where three hay crops were secured the first\r\nseason after such cultivation, when the fields had been pronounced a\r\nfailure in March. Alfalfa may be sown on such ground as late as the\r\nfirst of June if the weeds have been thoroughly subdued. Or, if it has\r\nbeen sown in the spring and the weeds seem to be overtopping it in July,\r\nmow close to the ground, rake into windrows and burn. Then disk and\r\nharrow thoroughly and sow again. In all probability there will be\r\nsomething of a crop to mow early in September, with a considerable\r\nautumn growth to follow. If it is not desired to sow alfalfa in\r\nmidsummer, disk this ground and sow to rye or oats for pasture; then\r\nlate in August disk and put in readiness for September sowing. The\r\nfailure may have been because the soil had not enough bacteria, or\r\nfavorable environment for the bacteria. Some of the seed sowed at first\r\nundoubtedly germinated and some bacteria were developed; enough\r\ncertainly to prepare the soil for the second sowing. It is unwise after\r\nsuch a failure to go to another field or to wait for another year. It is\r\nwiser to meet the conditions at once, and vigorously persevere.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the application of lime, mentioned on a preceding page,\r\nit should be noted that the later experiments seem to indicate that it\r\nis better to apply smaller quantities at shorter intervals than larger\r\nquantities at longer intervals; also that air-slacked lime is less\r\ncaustic than the quicklime, and not so liable, when recently applied, to\r\nharm the young plants which may come in contact with it, hence more of\r\nthe former may be used and with greater safety. Ordinarily quicklime is\r\nconsidered the most beneficial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Bur Clover Pod=\r\n\r\nMagnified six diameters]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Yellow Trefoil Seed Pod=\r\n\r\nMagnified twelve diameters]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Alfalfa Seed Pod=\r\n\r\nMagnified six diameters]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Spotted Clover Pod=\r\n\r\nMagnified six diameters]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VI._\r\n\r\nCultivation\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIPPING IS AN INVIGORANT\r\n\r\nStrange as this title may seem it suggests a very important means of\r\nsecuring a satisfactory stand. In fact in some parts of the South, where\r\nthe land has become very foul, it is occasionally recommended to sow the\r\nalfalfa in rows, eighteen inches apart, for regular cultivation the\r\nfirst season. After the second year the crowns will have sent up so many\r\nstems that the surface of the ground will be well occupied. Spurrier, in\r\nhis work referred to in Chapter I, recommended drilling in rows and\r\ncultivating the first year. But it is better to get rid of the weeds\r\nbefore trying alfalfa. The cultivation here recommended is clipping,\r\nmanuring, disking and harrowing. Frequently when alfalfa is sowed in the\r\nspring it comes up weak and spindling. In such case clip it just before\r\nready to bloom, having the mower sickle set rather high. If the growth\r\nis not very heavy, leave this cutting on the ground; if quite heavy,\r\nremove it. The field may need to be clipped again during the summer, but\r\nthe farmer can feel reasonably assured that he will have a good stand\r\nthe following spring. If the leaves turn yellow, mowing is the remedy.\r\nIf there is any sign of the “spotted leaf” disease, the mower should be\r\nused forthwith. Of course if alfalfa comes up strong, vigorous, and\r\nfree from weeds, it should stand until blossoming is well begun and then\r\nbe mown for hay.\r\n\r\nIt should not be supposed that the purpose in clipping and allowing the\r\nclippings to remain on the ground is primarily to make a mulch. It is to\r\nretard the weeds, and as no other way equally convenient and economical\r\nhas presented itself, the young growths are mown and left on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country Crab grass (_Panicum sanguinale_) is the\r\nplant or weed that most persistently interferes with the prosperity of\r\nalfalfa during its first year, and frequent mowing is the remedy most\r\nrecommended and resorted to, but there are growers who maintain that\r\nsuch treatment is not best. An extensive and very successful grower in\r\nsouthern Kansas tells the author repeated experience has demonstrated to\r\nhis satisfaction that the advice to mow alfalfa frequently during the\r\nfirst summer may under some circumstances be quite wrong. If the season\r\nhappens to be wet, and there is a rank growth of Crab grass, frequent\r\nmowing causes the Crab grass to set in a close sod and smother out the\r\nalfalfa. He says: “My practice has been, under these conditions, to let\r\nthe Crab grass grow with the alfalfa until matured, before mowing. The\r\nyoung alfalfa will usually keep its head out sufficiently to breathe,\r\nand will survive until the Crab grass is matured and all is cut. If\r\nallowed to mature, the Crab grass will not start a second time, and the\r\nalfalfa immediately springs up and occupies the ground. Where the Crab\r\ngrass is very rank it may sometimes be blown down in spots and smother\r\nout some alfalfa, but even under these conditions one will have a much\r\nbetter stand than is possible by repeated mowings. This is not mere\r\ntheory, but has been proven correct by frequent experience and close\r\nobservation of the other method during the same seasons.” Something\r\nsimilar may be said of Witch-grass (_Panicum capillare_), which,\r\nhowever, is less obnoxious than the Crab grass, because of not having\r\nthe habit of rooting at the joints.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country Crab grass (_Panicum sanguinale_) is the\r\nplant or weed that most persistently as to make burning in the spring\r\nseem the most feasible means of getting rid of them, and fire is\r\nresorted to. Prof. A. M. Ten Eyck says he has seen this done a number of\r\ntimes without injury to the alfalfa crowns. He, however, recommends\r\ndisking after burning, to loosen the exposed soil and leave the surface\r\ngenerally in a better condition. Sowing additional seed on the ground\r\nbefore such disking may do much to improve and thicken the stand.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Nebraska Farmer_ has been collecting information on\r\nalfalfa culture from every section of the United States for the past ten\r\nyears, and as a result of this work unhesitatingly advances the opinion\r\nthat “nine-tenths of the failures with alfalfa have been due to failure\r\nor neglect to cut it as should have been done when young. This is the\r\nlaw of alfalfa culture; it must be cut down. And the man who has not the\r\ncourage, morally and physically, to use a mowing machine persistently\r\nhad best pass by alfalfa culture. It takes moral courage to cut baby\r\nalfalfa; but it must be cut down to save it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURING\r\n\r\nA light top-dressing of manure after sowing, or, in case of fall sowing,\r\nany time during the winter, helps to conserve moisture as well as to\r\ngive the growing plants some nitrogenous food. Applying a top-dressing\r\nof stable manure at least every second or third winter is certain to\r\nprove profitable. If it contains coarse straw or other litter, this\r\nshould be raked and hauled off later, but before the alfalfa grows too\r\nhigh, especially if the hay is intended for the city market. Many\r\nsuccessful growers in Kansas, who claim to cut from five to seven tons\r\nof alfalfa hay per acre in a season apply a top-dressing of manure every\r\nwinter. The highest yields reported from eastern states are where this\r\npractice is followed. Some experiment station men believe that where\r\nthis is not done the crop will after eight or ten years tend to\r\nimpoverish the land instead of further improving it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISKING\r\n\r\nThe foremost method of cultivation is with the disk harrow, one of the\r\nmost excellent farm implements ever invented. Alfalfa sown in the fall\r\nis almost invariably helped by disking the following spring, with the\r\ndisks set quite straight, so as not to cut the crowns but to split them.\r\nIt is usually well to follow this disking with a tooth harrow, with its\r\nteeth set straight. Occasionally in a dry summer the disk may be used to\r\ngreat advantage after the second, and possibly the third, cutting also.\r\nMany disk their alfalfa field every spring, and some after each cutting,\r\nothers do so only once in every two or three years, owing to weather\r\nconditions and the conditions of the alfalfa. In some instances the\r\ncommon harrow is used instead of a disk.\r\n\r\nThe disking has several beneficial effects. It splits and spreads the\r\ncrowns, causing more and consequently finer stems to spring up,\r\naffording hay of the most delightful quality, easily cured; it loosens\r\nthe soil about the crowns, conserves moisture and destroys the weeds.\r\nThere need be no fear of killing the plants if the disks and the\r\nharrow-teeth are set straight and weighted or otherwise adjusted to give\r\ndirect and steady forward movement. As an implement for the cultivation\r\nand invigoration of an alfalfa field the disk harrow has no equal, and\r\nits frequent use is by those who know it best deemed quite\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESEEDING\r\n\r\nIf it is a question of reseeding the whole field, the problem is simple.\r\nIn that case disk and harrow the ground and sow half as much seed as was\r\nsowed at first. But to restore bare spots is more difficult; the young\r\nplants from the reseeding in these spots will be shaded by the larger\r\ngrowth about them, and such reseeding seldom gives the desired results.\r\nThere is no doubt that very many fields are given up as failures and\r\ninferior crops planted in them, when a thorough disking would have\r\nrenewed the growth, saved a crop, and, what is more important, a stand\r\nof alfalfa. Many reports have come to the writer of fields that had\r\nlittle sign of life the first of March, yet when thoroughly disked,\r\ncross-disked and harrowed, surprised the neighborhood by showing in two\r\nweeks a strong growth.\r\n\r\nSome wishing to be on the safe side, have sown a little seed after this\r\nheavy disking and harrowing, but many of them have reported an entire\r\nloss of the seed, as the plants from the previous sowing came up so\r\nthick as to choke out those from the later seeding. In some states a\r\ncommon plan of thickening a stand is to let the third crop ripen seed,\r\nand then about the last of September disk and harrow the seed into the\r\nground where it grew. This frequently saves the stand and adds many\r\nyears to its life. But where a field begins to fail after a third year\r\nit is usually better to plow it up and raise one or two crops of corn, a\r\ncrop of oats or of millet, and then reseed.\r\n\r\n\r\nALFALFA UNDER IRRIGATION\r\n\r\nThe greatest yields of alfalfa are produced by irrigation. Reported\r\nyields of six or more cuttings, aggregating eight to twelve tons per\r\nacre each year, are almost invariably, yet not always, from districts\r\nwhere irrigation is practiced. It is claimed by experiment station\r\nexperts from the irrigation states that the tendency is to use too much\r\nwater; too much at a time and too often. The general recommendation is\r\nto irrigate thoroughly before the ground is plowed or disked, and not\r\nagain till the alfalfa is about four inches high. Then again a week\r\nbefore each cutting. It has been found that old alfalfa fields do not\r\nneed as much water as new fields, the alfalfa roots seeming to find\r\nmoisture and bring it to the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is insisted that the surface must be perfectly smooth to keep water\r\nfrom settling into low places and smothering the plants. Some farmers do\r\nnot irrigate for the second crop if as much as two inches of rain falls\r\nafter the first mowing. Others claim that old fields do not need\r\nflooding for the second crop even if there has been no rainfall after\r\nthe first cutting.\r\n\r\nWilcox in his “Irrigation Farming”[3] says: “The critical time with\r\nalfalfa is the first six weeks of its growth. Flooding during this\r\nperiod is quite certain to give the plants a backset from which they\r\nseldom fully recover before the second, and sometimes not before the\r\nthird year, and it is not often in the arid states that rain falls with\r\nsufficient frequency to dispense with the necessity for irrigating the\r\nplants while small. By soaking the earth from thirty-six to forty-eight\r\nhours before seeding, however, the plants will make vigorous growth\r\nuntil they are ten to twelve inches high, after which they may be\r\nirrigated with safety.\r\n\r\n  [3] “Irrigation Farming,” by Lute Wilcox: 314 pp. Orange Judd Company,\r\n  New York.\r\n\r\n“When alfalfa has become established, a single copious irrigation after\r\neach cutting will ordinarily be found sufficient. Irrigation before\r\ncutting is undesirable, because it leaves the earth so soft as to\r\ninterfere with the movement of machinery and loads. It also makes the\r\nstalks more sappy, and, while they will retain the leaves better, there\r\nis more difficulty to be experienced in the curing at harvest time; and\r\ntaken all in all, we much prefer to irrigate after each cutting. In\r\nColorado we cut alfalfa three times and often four times in a season,\r\nhence the stand gets as many irrigations. Some people irrigate very\r\nearly in springtime, before the crowns have awakened from their hibernal\r\nrest, but this practice is not right. The chill of the water in very\r\nearly spring is not conducive to quick growth and may often retard the\r\nplants in getting an early start. We do not irrigate prior to the first\r\ncutting unless the season is particularly dry and the plants seem to\r\nactually demand water. We irrigate late in the fall and apply a\r\ntop-dressing of light barnyard manure, which is found to be of great\r\nservice in several ways.”\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF IRRIGATION UPON COMPOSITION\r\n\r\nI find no report of experiments published by any station in which the\r\ninfluence of irrigation upon alfalfa hay is made a special study, but\r\nBulletin No. 80 of the Utah station contains a great deal of information\r\nalong this line relative to grain crops, potatoes, and mixed grasses. In\r\nsumming up the results of the experiments, the following conclusions are\r\n\r\n“Heavy irrigations increase the percentage of weight of the heads of\r\nplants; light irrigations increase the relative weight of leaves.\r\n\r\n“Irrigation modifies definitely the composition of plants and plant\r\nparts; the seeds are affected more than any other plant part.\r\n\r\n“The percentage of protein in corn kernels was increased from 12.05 to\r\n15.08, as the amount of irrigation decreased; in oat kernels from 14.07\r\nto 20.79; in wheat kernels from 15.26 to 26.72. In all these seeds the\r\nfat and nitrogen-free extracts were increased by liberal waterings.\r\n\r\n“Increased irrigations increased the starch content and decreased the\r\nprotein content of potatoes.\r\n\r\n“The water in plants is somewhat dependent on the water in the soil.\r\n\r\n“The proportion of ear corn to stover increased regularly with the\r\nincreased application of water.\r\n\r\n“The percentage of grain in the wheat crop increased with increased\r\nirrigations.\r\n\r\n“The yield of wheat increased up to thirty inches of water.\r\n\r\n“Crops in an arid district require a greater number of pounds of water\r\nfor one pound of dry matter than in humid climates.”\r\n\r\nThe experiments cited do not include alfalfa, yet the results with other\r\ncrops would indicate that the percentage of protein in alfalfa hay may\r\nbe less where the crop is grown by irrigation than where it is grown by\r\ndry-land farming. The composition of the hay, however, will depend upon\r\nthe quantity of water supplied to the crop and not upon the method; that\r\nis, alfalfa which receives as much natural rainfall as other alfalfa\r\nwould receive by irrigation, would be similarly affected in composition,\r\nand from the experiments with grains reported in the bulletin noted, it\r\nwould appear that with the application of large quantities of water the\r\npercentage of protein is decreased; yet, the yield is increased, and\r\nalthough the feeding value of the crop may be a little less, the\r\nquantity may be greater, due to large applications of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIDE VARIATIONS IN CONTENT\r\n\r\nProfessor Ten Eyck compiled from their station bulletins the following\r\nfigures on the composition of alfalfa hay in four different states:\r\n\r\n  ----------+--------+----------+----------+----------+---------\r\n            |Bulletin|          | Carbo-   |          |Number of\r\n            | Number |  Protein | hydrates |   Fat    |Analyses\r\n  ----------+--------+----------+----------+----------+---------\r\n            |        |_Per Cent_|_Per Cent_|_Per Cent_|\r\n  New Jersey|  148   |  15.84   |  38.97   |   3.82   |    2\r\n  Colorado  |   39   |  17.36   |  36.71   |   1.65   |    9\r\n  Utah      |   61   |   9.22   |  43.25   |    .97   |   29\r\n  Kansas    |  114   |  11.89   |  41.03   |    .66   |    3\r\n  ----------+--------+----------+----------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nOn this showing he remarks:\r\n\r\n“Although it was not definitely stated, I take it that the Colorado and\r\nUtah hay were grown by irrigation, while the New Jersey and Kansas hay\r\nreceived no irrigation. It will be observed that while the percentages\r\nof protein and fat in the Utah samples are low, the percentage of\r\ncarbohydrates is high; yet the Colorado samples grown under irrigation\r\nshow a larger percentage of protein and fat than the Kansas samples\r\ngrown without irrigation. The crude protein often varies in quantity\r\naccording to the stage of maturity of the alfalfa when it is cut for\r\nhay, as shown by experiments at the Kansas station, and described in\r\nBulletin No. 114.\r\n\r\n“The general conclusion may be that the protein content of alfalfa hay\r\nwill decrease to some extent, according as the supply of water furnished\r\nthe crop is increased; that is, by supplying the right quantity of\r\nwater, a better quality of hay may be grown by irrigation than is often\r\ngrown in humid climates in soil which receives only the natural\r\nrainfall. From what I know of the Colorado and Utah stations, I would\r\njudge that the quantity of water supplied at the Utah station was much\r\nlarger than that supplied at the Colorado station. At the Colorado\r\nstation the supply of irrigation water is often limited, and hence, the\r\nlarger percentage of protein and fat which appears in the samples of hay\r\ngrown and analyzed at that station.”\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the secretary of agriculture (1904) says that at\r\nthe Utah station a series of co-operative experiments is in progress to\r\ndetermine the water necessary, and the most favorable method of\r\napplication, to insure a maximum yield of alfalfa, and also experiments\r\nto determine the minimum application of water required to secure a crop.\r\n“It has been found that abundant irrigation throughout the season, 61\r\ninches of water being applied, gave a yield of 6.2 tons per acre, while\r\nfour irrigations in the early part of the season with only 25 inches\r\ngave five tons per acre, showing that beyond a certain supply the excess\r\nis wasted.”\r\n\r\nA. S. Hitchcock, in United States Farmers’ Bulletin No. 215, speaking of\r\nthe Utah experiment just mentioned, says that where the supply of water\r\nis limited a much less quantity than is ordinarily used will produce\r\npaying crops. The minimum quantity to produce a crop of alfalfa, and the\r\ntime at which the water should be applied, depends upon the soil and\r\nclimatic conditions.

However, it is also to be\r\nnoted that a much less quantity of water, when applied at intervals of\r\nthree or four weeks, produced a fair crop. Fifteen and 17 inches of\r\nwater applied in this way produced more than half as much as 61 inches\r\napplied at frequent intervals. Furthermore, three irrigations of 15 to\r\n17 inches produced about the same results as the same amount applied at\r\nfour irrigations. In applying irrigation water to fields it is necessary\r\nto saturate the soil to a reasonable depth. All the water that drains\r\noff beyond the amount required for use is lost to the crop. It is not\r\nnecessary to apply water again until the crop has removed a large part\r\nof the available supply.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gathering Alfalfa Hay in Windrows with a Side-delivery\r\nHorserake]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cutting a Fine Field of Alfalfa]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VII._\r\n\r\nHarvesting\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLS FOR INTELLIGENCE AND PAINSTAKING\r\n\r\nConsiderable space in this volume is devoted to the discussion of soil\r\nand seeding, but their importance cannot well be over-estimated. Really\r\nthe whole subject of alfalfa might well be treated under the two heads,\r\n“Seeding” and “Harvesting,” so very inclusive are these two phases of\r\nthe subject. Without careful seeding one cannot have a crop to harvest,\r\nand without careful harvesting he might almost as well not have a crop.\r\nBoth call for intelligence and painstaking farming, and much patience\r\nand hard work. But the rewards of these virtues and labors are heavy\r\nyields from the most valuable forage plant. If it is worth nine times as\r\nmuch as timothy, it can well demand a little more time and labor than\r\nthe average crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT VALUE OF LEAVES\r\n\r\nThe first point to accentuate as we approach the subject of harvesting\r\nis the preeminent value of the leaves. These contain from seventy-five\r\nto eighty per cent of the protein of the whole plant, that valuable\r\ncompound that goes to produce milk and meat. It has been estimated that\r\na ton of properly cured alfalfa leaves is equal in protein to 2800\r\npounds of wheat bran; and when it is also estimated by careful observers\r\nthat the loss of leaves in harvesting, even under favoring\r\ncircumstances, ranges from fifteen to thirty or more per cent it is\r\nreadily seen that the harvesting is an important part in alfalfa\r\nhaymaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TO CUT\r\n\r\nFor the best hay the cutting should begin when the alfalfa is about\r\none-tenth in bloom. Of course, if the acreage is small, calling for but\r\none or two days’ cutting, it might stand without particular harm until a\r\nfifth or fourth was in bloom. Cutting should be completed, if possible,\r\nby the time one-half is in bloom, as after that it is cut at a loss of\r\nleaves. As they have more experience the tendency among farmers is to\r\ncut alfalfa earlier than had before been believed at all desirable, and\r\nsome experienced growers and feeders now insist upon cutting just before\r\nthe blossoming stage is reached.\r\n\r\nExperiments seem to show that horses like the hay that has been cut when\r\nat least half in bloom, or later, better than do other stock. For sake\r\nof the after effects on the plant, it is highly important that the first\r\ncutting be made in the early bloom, as, if it is delayed, the second\r\ncrop starts more slowly and gives a lighter yield. Frequently a short\r\ndelay in cutting the first crop means that the field will produce but\r\ntwo crops instead of three or four. So important is this that Prof. H.\r\nM. Cottrell declares that he has found it profitable to cut the first\r\ncrop of a season in earliest bloom even if it were to be injured by\r\nbeing rained upon, or in fact entirely lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOST PROTEIN IN EARLY CUTTINGS\r\n\r\nThe Utah experiment station found by a feeding test that the early cut\r\nalfalfa was worth far more than any later cutting. It reported:\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------+----------+-----------\r\n                                |Hay worth,| Beef, lbs.\r\n          Stage of Growth       | per ton  | produced\r\n  ------------------------------+----------+-----------\r\n  When ¹⁄₁₀ in bloom            |   $5.35  |   706\r\n  When in full bloom            |    4.90  |   562\r\n  When ¹⁄₂ of blooms have fallen|    4.35  |   490\r\n  ------------------------------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\nThe Kansas station found the protein content to be:\r\n\r\n   Stage of Growth   Protein content\r\n  When ¹⁄₁₀ in bloom   18.5 per cent.\r\n  When ¹⁄₂ in bloom    17.2  „    „\r\n  When in full bloom   14.4  „    „\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTANT WATCHFULNESS DEMANDED\r\n\r\nIn humid regions, the alfalfa farmer at the time of the first cutting\r\noften finds himself in a trying position. The value of the leaves\r\ndemands early cutting, and this may be just when it is likely to rain\r\nwith great frequency. He knows that a wetting will injure his hay, and\r\nthat this results in more or less loss of some of its most valuable\r\nparts from the hour of cutting until it is thoroughly cured. The\r\nColorado station reports that alfalfa hay left out for fifteen days\r\nafter cutting and rained on twice, lost 26.1 per cent of its feeding\r\nvalue. Hay left out for seven days and having only one light rain, lost\r\n10 per cent. Another lot left out three days, without rain, lost 5 per\r\ncent. Wetting delays the curing, and by the washing the hay loses much\r\nsugar, dextrin and other soluble matters, and also develops fungi.\r\nHowever, the only thing to do is to cut, exercising good judgment of\r\ncourse as to the amount each day.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSSES IN CURING\r\n\r\nHeadden found, at the Colorado station, that in an average alfalfa plant\r\nthe stems amounted to forty to fifty per cent of the weight, while with\r\nvery leafy, small-stemmed plants the leaves sometimes form more than\r\nsixty per cent of the entire weight. The leaves were readily lost if the\r\nhay was not handled carefully. He concluded that the minimum loss from\r\nthe falling off of the leaves and stems in careful haymaking amounts to\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty per cent; and in cases where conditions have been\r\nunfavorable, as much as sixty or even sixty-six per cent of the entire\r\ndry crop is lost. Stated in another way, with the best of conditions,\r\nand with great care, for every 1,700 pounds of hay taken off the field,\r\nat least 300 pounds of leaves and stems are left scattered on the\r\nground, “and, in very bad cases, as much as 1,200 pounds may be left for\r\neach 800 pounds taken.” A study of these facts should induce the careful\r\nhaymaker to use all possible skill in curing alfalfa, and they show that\r\nit will be profitable to expend more than the usual amount of labor in\r\nsaving the leaves, considering that they are worth, pound for pound,\r\nnearly four times as much as the stems.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING IN HUMID REGIONS\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, it is not well to cut alfalfa immediately after a heavy\r\nrain, because the wet ground will operate against proper curing. Begin\r\ncutting in the morning, when the dew is well off. If the weather is\r\nfair, the tedder ought to follow about two hours behind the mower. It is\r\na mistake to think that the sun is the great curing agent. Too long\r\nexposure to the sun makes the curing all the more unsatisfactory,\r\nbesides drying the leaves in such a way that they crumble and drop off.\r\n\r\nAs long as alfalfa remains “alive” water will be exhaled from the\r\nsurface of the leaves and be pumped constantly from the stalks in a\r\nnatural way much as though they were still standing. On the other hand,\r\nif newly cut alfalfa is spread too long in hot sunshine, the leaves are\r\nscorched to such an extent that transpiration of moisture from pores\r\nbecomes impossible. Hence, that in the stalks can only escape by simple\r\nevaporation, which is very slow. By this means much undesirable, in fact\r\nharmful, moisture in the hay is brought to the barn or stack, although\r\nthe leaves of the hay are dry and crisp.\r\n\r\nAs J. E. Wing has well said in his bulletin (Bul. No. 129 prepared for\r\nthe Pennsylvania department of agriculture), “there is a principle to be\r\nobserved in making alfalfa hay that applies to making hay from all\r\nclovers. If it can be so managed that the leaves are not at once burned\r\nand dried to powder, the moisture from the stems is the more easily\r\nremoved. Leaves are natural evaporators of sap; stems are not.\r\nTherefore, while the leaf has yet pliancy and some semblance of its\r\nnatural condition, it is most efficiently carrying away the sap of the\r\nstem, but when it is dried up it no longer aids in drying the plant at\r\nall. Therefore, the best hay in all respects is made partly in the\r\nshade, in loosely turned windrows, or in narrow cocks.”\r\n\r\nTwo or three hours behind the tedder start the rake and keep it going\r\nregardless of the noon hour, and unless the hay is very heavy it may be\r\nput into small cocks, this to be completed before the dew forms. In\r\nhumid regions, hay is cured best and with greatest safety by the use of\r\nhay-caps, and these should be put on the cocks also before the dew\r\nforms, and removed each morning. The hay may be left in these cocks for\r\nfour or five days, as found necessary, and then stacked or stored in the\r\nbarn. This may not follow, however, unless the weather is favorable.\r\nMany prefer to leave the hay in the windrows until the second morning,\r\nturning them by hand or otherwise before noon and putting into cocks in\r\nthe afternoon, letting these stand for two or three days. If it is left\r\nin the cocks over three days, they should be moved or the plants under\r\nthem will be smothered. All agree that alfalfa should not lie in the\r\nswath over two or three hours. Most who have ever used a tedder like it\r\nif the alfalfa is less than half in bloom. If half or more in bloom, the\r\ntedder may cause the breaking off and loss of many leaves. Most\r\nexperiment stations recommend that the hay be put into small cocks on\r\nthe day of the cutting, if the weather is at all fair, not risking it in\r\nthe windrows over night. It is a fact that cocked green alfalfa, even\r\nwithout caps, will shed much rain, while when fairly well-cured it will\r\nnot do so.\r\n\r\nA Colorado farmer reported that he started the mower one morning as soon\r\nas the dew was off, followed it with the tedder one hour later, and with\r\nthe rake one hour behind the tedder; he kept a force of men only two\r\nhours behind the rake putting the alfalfa, yet quite green, into small\r\ncocks. These stood through two days of heavy rain. Later the cocks were\r\nopened and found to be unharmed, and after one day the hay was put into\r\nstacks in excellent condition. This was a somewhat unusual circumstance,\r\nsurely, and might not often occur in a climate less dry than that in\r\nsome parts of Colorado.\r\n\r\nA grower in southern Kansas, however, who harvests about one thousand\r\ntons of alfalfa per year, and is working with it nearly every day from\r\nthe second week in May until November 10, insists that alfalfa, under\r\nthe same conditions of rainfall, is much easier to save in fair feeding\r\ncondition than red clover. He finds the side-delivery rake especially\r\nexcellent for turning over the green or wet windrows to the sun and air\r\nwith the least loss of leaves, and cured thus, after being wet, the\r\nnatural color is better preserved. “That alfalfa hay has a higher\r\nfeeding value than almost any other, even when saved under the most\r\nunfavorable circumstances, should be impressed upon the inexperienced.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF HAY-CAPS\r\n\r\nAny man who goes into the business of raising alfalfa anywhere in the\r\nrain belt cannot well afford to ignore hay-caps as a part of his\r\nequipment. Comparatively the cost is slight and the trouble of using\r\nthem small considered in the light of their great utility, although the\r\nexpense, and the use and care of them may at first blush appear to be\r\nquite formidable. American haymakers do not seem to appreciate the bad\r\neffect of dew upon the color and aroma of all kinds of hay. Prof. F. H.\r\nStorer in his “Agriculture” (Vol. III, p. 559) says: “One advantage\r\ngained by the use of hay-caps to protect the cocks during the night, is\r\nthat they hold in the raked-up warmth, and keep the hay from cooling\r\noff. Thus it happens that the hay not only improves a little as to\r\ndryness during the night, but is all ready to dry rapidly when the cocks\r\nare again exposed to the air and sunshine, on being uncovered in the\r\nmorning. All this as a normal and constant benefit, to say nothing of\r\nthe advantages derived from the caps in case light rains, or even heavy\r\nrains, should fall before the cocks are again opened. The caps keep dew\r\nfrom settling upon the hay, moreover, and thus prevent the loss of\r\naromatic matters that would result if the dew were to dry off from the\r\nhay.”\r\n\r\n“With regard to the exclusion of dew, it is not alone its power to carry\r\noff aroma that should be considered. When dew ‘falls’ it must tend to\r\ncarry with it any particles of solid matter that may happen to be in the\r\nair from which it is deposited, and, in this way the spores of fungi,\r\nsuch as would cause the hay to mold, are put upon it. It can scarcely be\r\nquestioned that many of the organisms deposited with the dew are likely\r\nto promote hurtful decomposition, especially in case the hay should\r\nremain or become damp, and the less of these organisms that infest the\r\nhay the better it will be.”\r\n\r\nWhen the farmer considers that a ton of well-cured alfalfa hay is worth\r\nabout as much as a ton of wheat bran, he ought to see that it is\r\nprofitable to protect it from the rain and the dew. He would scarcely\r\nhesitate to provide suitable covering if he had several tons of bran in\r\nthe field exposed to the elements. Hay-caps will soon pay for\r\nthemselves by the finer quality of the hay they assure, aside from the\r\nlarger quantity of the best grade that their protection guarantees.\r\n\r\nStorer further says, “there can be no question as to the very great\r\nmerit of hay-caps when properly used. They are simply pieces of stout,\r\ncotton cloth of suitable size, say 40 to 45 inches square as a minimum,\r\n(60 inches square would be far better--Author) which are thrown over the\r\ncocks when rain is imminent, or at nightfall. These cloths may have\r\nwooden pegs or some sort of weight attached to each corner to hold them\r\nin place; the pegs can be driven into the ground or pushed under the\r\nhay, as seems most suitable to the size of the cock or conditions of the\r\nweather. The porosity of the cotton cloth hinders dampness from\r\ncollecting beneath it at the top of the cock which it covers.”\r\n\r\nCuring alfalfa in dry regions where the problems and dangers of rainfall\r\ndo not need any large consideration, is attended with few of the\r\ndifficulties which confront the grower in a region of much humidity. In\r\nwestern Kansas and Nebraska, and in Texas and other states where summer\r\nrains are somewhat infrequent, the mowers start at the beginning and do\r\nnot stop until the field or fields of alfalfa are all in the swath. The\r\nrakes follow close behind, frequently the side-delivery rake, and then\r\nthe gathering implement, usually designated as a “go-devil,” keep only\r\nabout a half-day behind, dragging the cured hay to the stack or rick\r\nwhere the horse-fork lifts and carries it to the center of the stack, to\r\nbe distributed and placed by men with pitchforks. The market and feeding\r\nvalue of hay so cured and gathered, is deemed by some authorities as\r\nnot the highest. Curing in the windrow alone is likely to be a mere\r\ndrying (perhaps too rapid drying) of one side of the exposed portions.\r\nAlfalfa should cure successively in the swath, windrow, cock and stack\r\nor mow, to develop its greatest value. The man who has so many acres\r\nthat he cannot cure it in this way might do better with fewer acres for\r\nhay, and pasture hogs on the remainder, or use the land for other crops.\r\nStill it is true that alfalfa even poorly cured has no inconsiderable\r\nfeeding value. Many farmers in the West and Middle West claim to secure\r\nvery good hay by early following the mower with the tedder, this with\r\nthe rake, and then the “buncher,” letting the hay remain in bunches over\r\nnight and dragging it to the stack the next day. Others take from the\r\nwindrow to wagons by a hay-loader, preferably one operated by a belt.\r\n\r\nAfter all is said and done, and regardless of thrift and yield, it is\r\nunquestionable that the grower of alfalfa in humid regions meets with\r\ndifficulties in the matter of satisfactory curing that in some years are\r\nalmost or quite disheartening, and of a character to which his brother\r\nin arid territory is virtually a total stranger. Curing in the two\r\nregions presents different problems, with advantage all the time\r\nfavoring the man in the country of little rainfall.\r\n\r\nSecond and later cuttings are not so much endangered by rains as is the\r\nfirst, and, hence, these are usually cured in better condition.\r\nNotwithstanding this, virtually all tests point out that the first\r\ncutting has more feeding value and is better relished by all kinds of\r\nstock. Most farmers are agreed that it pays to cut every time the\r\nalfalfa blooms, up to the last of September in the North, and possibly a\r\nmonth later in the more southern latitudes. A few have reported that\r\nthey prefer to make but two cuttings a year, claiming to realize a\r\ngreater feeding value by so doing; but it seems that the loss in leaves\r\nand protein, together with the fact that live stock has less relish for\r\nthe more mature cuttings, makes frequent cutting by far the most\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the points to be emphasized in cutting alfalfa for hay, and\r\nits treatment immediately after, are:\r\n\r\n_Cut in early bloom._\r\n\r\n_Handle as little as possible._\r\n\r\n_Prevent its being wet after cutting._\r\n\r\n_Cure if possible partly in the swath, in the windrow, in the cock and\r\nin the stack or mow._\r\n\r\n_Cut as often as it blooms, which will range from twice in New England\r\nto nine times a year in southern Oklahoma, southern California, Texas\r\nand Louisiana._\r\n\r\n_In a region of frequent rains protect with hay-caps._\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING FOR SEED\r\n\r\nThe first cutting should not be used for seed for three reasons: First,\r\nif that cutting is delayed until the seed has ripened, the second and\r\nthird cuttings will be very light, and in the extreme northern alfalfa\r\nterritory there may not be even a second. A stronger reason is that at\r\nthe time of the first cutting, favorable weather is likely to be much\r\nless certain and rains will interfere with the stacking of the seed\r\ncrop, which, to insure its best value, must be put in the stack or mow\r\nwithout wetting. Another is that the seed pods at that season are not\r\nusually so well filled and the proportion of fertile seeds is less\r\nbecause the bees and other insects have not so early in the season had\r\ntime and opportunity to aid in the pollenation.\r\n\r\nCutting should be done when the greater proportion of the seeds are\r\nhard, but not sufficiently ripe to shell. At this stage a majority of\r\nthe pods are turned a dark-brown color and the seeds are fully\r\ndeveloped. Frequently the cutting can be raked into windrows after two\r\nhours if the weather is drying, and in two or three hours more put into\r\ncocks and let stand for twenty-four to forty-eight hours, as the weather\r\nmay justify. It should, however, be well cured and thoroughly dry when\r\nput in the stack, or there is danger of heating, and stack-heating\r\nseriously injures the vitality of the seed. It is not uncommon, if\r\nextremely ripe, to leave the cutting in the swath only an hour or a\r\nhalf-hour, then stack, and let stand for autumn or later threshing. If\r\nallowed to stand in the stack for about thirty days, the entire mass\r\ngoes through a sweating and curing process which makes the threshing\r\neasier, while less of the seed is left in the straw than would be if it\r\nhad not stack-cured. In western Kansas many seed raisers cut their seed\r\ncrop with a self-binder, put the sheaves in shocks the same day and\r\nthresh in about ten days, or put it into a stack to await a convenient\r\nthreshing time. They claim to secure 20 per cent more of the seed in\r\nthis way than if they cut with the ordinary mower. Others cut with a\r\nmower having a dropper attachment which leaves the alfalfa in small\r\nbunches at the will of the driver, in the center of the swath, and\r\nthese are “straddled” by the team and the wheels of the mower in the\r\nsubsequent rounds. These bunches are left for two or three days and then\r\nstacked. There is little, if any, danger from mold or spontaneous\r\ncombustion in stacks of alfalfa cut for seed, but there is danger of the\r\nseed heating in the stack if stacked when damp. If bright, clean seed is\r\nexpected, the stacks must be well topped with slough grass, or covered\r\nwith tarpaulins or boards, or given other protection. It is better still\r\nto put the alfalfa intended for seed into a barn.\r\n\r\nOne Kansas farmer in the western part of the state reports that he used\r\na self-binding harvester, shocked the sheaves like those of grain, let\r\nthem stand ten days and then put in a mow, with no bad results.\r\n\r\n\r\nYIELDS OF SEED\r\n\r\nThe yield of seed ranges all the way from two to thirteen bushels per\r\nacre, the normal yield in the seed regions being four to eight bushels.\r\nIt is threshed with ordinary grain separators with seed attachments,\r\nalthough the clover-huller is usually preferred. No threshing machine\r\ncleans the seed satisfactorily or sufficiently, and a careful recleaning\r\nis necessary. Fanning mills or seed-cleaners are now made that will\r\nremove most weed seeds, seeds of dodder, and all light-weight and\r\nprobably infertile alfalfa seeds. However, no raiser should by rights\r\nthresh, to say nothing of marketing, the seeds of the dodder or any\r\nother weed with his alfalfa; these should be cut out of the field with\r\nscythe, sickle or knife a month before the alfalfa is cut.\r\n\r\nThe threshed alfalfa straw is worth only about half as much as the hay,\r\nyet it makes excellent feed for horses, colts and calves. Or, if put\r\ninto stacks of alfalfa of the third cutting, in alternate layers, it may\r\nbe fed to any stock to good advantage, as it is relished quite as well\r\nas ordinary third cuttings, notwithstanding its lower feeding value.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD CUTTING FOR SEED\r\n\r\nSeed raisers in some instances, especially in Kansas, use the third\r\ncutting for seed, claiming that the pods are more uniformly filled and\r\nthe seeds more generally fertile, due to the assistance of the bees in\r\npollenation. They claim, too, that this cutting has fewer weeds and weed\r\nseeds than its predecessors; also that they are thus sure of two good\r\nhay crops, while often if they use the second crop for seed, the third\r\ncrop is hardly worth more than the cutting. The only point left in favor\r\nof using the second cutting for seed, where the farmer is confident of a\r\nthird, is that the protein value of the second is the lowest, and hence\r\nits hay can better be spared than that from any other cutting.\r\n\r\nThe raising of seed in the more humid eastern states should not,\r\ngenerally, be attempted, as it will not only interfere with obtaining\r\nfull value in the hay crop, but the less fertile soil will not produce\r\nas vigorous seed as will the newer and richer lands west of the Missouri\r\nriver. At present the best seed for general use is produced between that\r\nriver and the Rocky mountains. Utah produces a hardy seed, but much if\r\nnot most of it is raised under irrigation, and, hence, at least\r\ntheoretically, not deemed best adapted for regions dependent entirely\r\nupon soil moisture from rains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Gathering an Alfalfa Crop in Page County, Iowa=\r\n\r\nPhotograph by courtesy of Henry Field]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Alfalfa Harvesting Scene in Yellowstone County,\r\nMontana]=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Mast and Boom Stacker, with Six-Tined Jackson Fork=\r\n\r\nThe mast is held in place by guy ropes from the top.

The true\r\nmedium for its curing is air, not sun; the sun has done possibly more\r\nthan its share already. But good hay is not completely and properly\r\ncured in swath, windrow and cock. If cured in the windrow, the exposed\r\nparts are liable to be much injured by the sun. Therefore the principle\r\nstands, “Handle alfalfa green.” It must be cut green, teddered, raked\r\nand cocked or bunched while comparatively green, and must not then be\r\nallowed to dry and parch to brittleness. True, it must not be put into a\r\nstack so long as it is possible to wring water out of the stalks. A\r\nconstant study should be to find the best method of getting the hay into\r\nstorage without loss of its natural color. The method that will safely\r\nstore it greenest will be the best to follow. Handled green the leaves\r\nare saved, and these constitute from 50 to 75 per cent of the whole\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTTING INTO WINTER QUARTERS\r\n\r\nWhen (in regions of much humidity) the hay is safely in cock, covered\r\nwith hay-caps, and has had a few days of curing, it is ready for\r\npermanent quarters. Remembering that the hay after its drying has begun\r\nshould be handled as little as possible, the cocks have been made small\r\nenough so that two men may lift them bodily onto a wagon, if a wagon is\r\nused in the stacking. From the wagon, the hay is lifted by a hayfork to\r\nthe stack. Or, more careful still, the farmer will use three slings to\r\neach wagon, which are lifted by a hook to the stack or mow. A sling is a\r\nheavy sheet the size of the wagon hayrack. One is spread on the bottom\r\nof the rack, another on top of the first one-third of the load, and the\r\nother on top of the second third. These slings are banded at the ends;\r\nthe ends are drawn together and a third of the load lifted to the stack\r\nor mow, thus saving in some instances a third more leaves than any other\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nIn arid and semi-arid territory, cocking and loading on or off wagons\r\nare dispensed with by dragging the rapidly dried hay directly to stacks\r\nbuilt in the fields, where the lifting into place is done with great\r\nexpedition by horse implements. A wheel-rake or “go-devil” is used to\r\ntake at once several cocks, bunches or a part of a windrow to a nearby\r\nstack. Others use a rope to drag one or more large cocks to the stack;\r\nor, if the hay is to be taken from windrows, it may be put upon wagons\r\nwith a loader. The loader is an excellent implement for handling\r\ntimothy and clover, but is apt to shake off a good many leaves of\r\nalfalfa if the hay is very dry. The more common sling now on the market\r\nis made of ropes, four ropes the length of the hayrack and with ropes\r\nacross like a rope ladder, and used to handle one-third or one-fourth of\r\na load. Others are made like the carriers of a threshing machine with\r\nslats and ropes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING IN THE BARN\r\n\r\nThe barn is the best place for alfalfa if all conditions are right.\r\nCases of spontaneous combustion in stack and mow make farmers fearful of\r\nusing the barn, especially for the first cutting, which is always most\r\ndifficult to cure. There are certain conditions that must be observed if\r\nthis hay is to complete its curing properly and safely in the mow. The\r\nbottom of the mow should be elevated at least a foot from the ground,\r\nfloored with poles or joists, and they should be about two-thirds\r\ncovered with boards or other material in such a way as to provide\r\nnumerous openings or air spaces of considerable size. If the mow already\r\nhas a tight floor, a part of the flooring should be removed before the\r\nhay is put in. Then a box or barrel should be placed in the center of\r\nthe space and lifted up as the filling proceeds. If the mow is over\r\nthirty feet long, a second barrel should be used; that is, an air shaft\r\nshould be left in about each fifteen to twenty feet. A layer of dry hay\r\nor straw sandwiched in about every four of five feet, as the mow fills,\r\ncan be used to much advantage. If the mow is large enough in length and\r\nwidth, an excellent, safe plan is to spread the first cutting over the\r\nentire bottom, filling up to a height of four or five feet. The second\r\ncutting may be placed over this, on top of a layer of straw, and the\r\nthird cutting over this. There is virtually no danger from spontaneous\r\ncombustion or from mold if this is done, and the hay will be as bright\r\nand green and almost as rich in protein in January as when harvested.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Berry of Jewell county, Kansas, member of the board of regents of\r\nthe state agricultural college, uses this method and bales his hay in\r\nOctober for the city markets, finding it in perfect condition. He puts\r\nhis hay into the mow green but not wet, direct from the cocks, or\r\nwindrows the day it is cut, in layers about four feet deep, with the\r\nslightest possible loss of leaves, no bleaching and no injury by dew. In\r\n1905 he cut his alfalfa four times and stored the fourth cutting on top\r\nof the three preceding. He says that having an open floor and plenty of\r\nair from the outside, the hay can be put in the barn as described; that\r\nit should not be tramped, and it will settle and cure perfectly. The\r\nbottom layer or first cutting may show some dust when taken out if\r\nhandled loose, but the color will be good and it will bale in with the\r\nother cuttings and all grade well. Hay cured in this way in 1904 graded\r\n“choice” in the St. Louis market.\r\n\r\nSpontaneous combustion does not occur very often, but it is a\r\npossibility, and it is well to bear in mind that hay may be put in the\r\nbarn too green. Observation teaches that it never takes place unless the\r\nhay has been put in the barn while containing a large amount of\r\nmoisture, and piled too deep. Alfalfa and other clover hays may safely\r\nbe put in the barn when they contain not to exceed 30 per cent of water.\r\nIf, however, they contain much more than this there is considerable\r\ndanger, especially where large quantities are put together, as is the\r\ncase in large, deep mows and sometimes in large stacks. A practical test\r\nwhich may be safely followed is to take a handful of hay, twist it as\r\nhard as possible, and if no juice can be wrung out of its stems, it is\r\ndry enough to be put in the mow. Bunches of wet hay mixed with dry hay\r\nhave often caused combustion. Such should always be discarded. It is\r\npoor policy to haul clover hays into a barn after sundown, as at that\r\ntime it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere very rapidly.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan for the haymaker to go into his mow every morning\r\nwhile the hay is curing and observe the conditions, but he should not,\r\nhowever, become alarmed if he finds that the top of his hay is very\r\ndamp. This will always be the case, even if it was comparatively dry\r\nwhen put in; considerable heat develops during the night, which in turn\r\nevaporates moisture. The following morning, when the air is cool, a\r\nlarge percentage of this, especially if the mow is not well ventilated,\r\nis condensed and settles back on the hay. If the moisture, however, is\r\nexcessive, it is a good plan to scatter a load of dry straw over the\r\ntop. This will absorb the moisture in part, after which filling may be\r\ncontinued. In case a load has been put in the barn too wet, it should be\r\nspread to the outer edges, as there is much less danger of combustion at\r\nthese places than in the center. In fact, the greatest heat is always\r\ndeveloped in the center, where the so-called craters form, and from\r\nwhich moisture and gases are given off as a result of heating and\r\noxidation below.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that spontaneous combustion cannot take place until the\r\nwater has all been evaporated, there is no danger until three to four\r\nweeks after the hay has been stored. During the first week or so, if the\r\nhay heats to such an extent that there is danger of combustion, it is\r\nwell to open up the center as much as possible and allow some of the\r\nheat to escape. If, however, the heating has continued much longer, it\r\nis dangerous practice to open the hay at all, because all that is\r\nneeded, after the water has been evaporated, is air, or oxygen to\r\nsupport combustion, and the mass will at once burst into flames.\r\nSometimes combustion takes place without flames, in which case the\r\ncenter of the mow gradually chars, leaving the hay there as black as\r\ncharcoal, and without value.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cottrell, discussing spontaneous combustion (Kansas Bul. No.\r\n114), says that all cases observed by him have occurred in hay of the\r\nseason’s first cutting--cut at a time when the growth was rank and the\r\ncuring most difficult. A period of wet, muggy weather in July or August\r\nincreases the danger, which in dry weather seems much less. On account\r\nof previous trouble from heating in the barn, he had four years prior to\r\nwriting stacked the first cutting out of doors and put only the later\r\ncuttings in the barn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSSES FROM STACKING\r\n\r\nThe Colorado station found that the loss in feeding value from the hour\r\nof cocking to the hour of taking from the stack was 12.4 per cent,\r\nwhile the loss in hay stored in the barn was about 2.5 per cent. If we\r\nadd to this the stacked hay lost by exposure, it will easily reach more\r\nthan 20 per cent under average conditions while in many cases it would\r\nreach 40 per cent. This certainly represents an enormous waste, and by\r\npreventing it a man with any considerable area of alfalfa could soon\r\nsave enough to pay for a barn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAY SHED\r\n\r\nAfter a barn the next best place for storing hay is a shed with an\r\nadjustable or lifting roof. The ground dimensions should be ample to\r\nallow the first cutting to cover its floor and not be over five or\r\npossibly six feet deep when first put in. The bottom of the mow should\r\nbe raised at least one foot from the ground, and the floor should have\r\nat least a twelve-inch air space about every three feet. Poles or joists\r\ncovered with dry straw or old hay make a good floor. Spread the hay over\r\nthe entire floor surface, on a layer of straw or other dry material. Use\r\nbarrels or boxes as recommended for ventilation in the barn, and lower\r\nthe roof until the second cutting. For such a roof the covering should\r\nbe of some such material as ruberoid, and the rafters need not be heavy,\r\nexcept about every sixteen feet. Strong iron clamps can be easily\r\nadjusted to the supports. When the second cutting is ready, raise the\r\nroof, which should be in sections, and put the second crop on top of the\r\nfirst. Follow this plan for all other cuttings. If a shed with a\r\nstationary roof is used, dry straw, or hay, or corn stover should be\r\nput on top of each cutting to protect the alfalfa from rain. Almost any\r\nkind of a shed or covered structure is preferable to a stack.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS FOR STACKING\r\n\r\nIf the hay is to be stacked, there are also special conditions that the\r\nexperienced insist should be observed. This is not to say that alfalfa\r\nhay stacked under conditions quite different may not give fair results,\r\nand much depends on the locality and the climate. However, the result\r\ndesired is palatable and nutritious hay and not such as is moldy,\r\nstack-burned or dusty. Stacking the hay directly on the ground is sure\r\nto mean a loss of some portion of it. Elevate the bottom of the stack\r\nwith poles, timbers or other like material; put straw at the bottom and,\r\npreferably, build a rick rather than a round stack. Start the bottom\r\nsixteen or eighteen feet wide and build straight up instead of tapering\r\nor slanting the sides, as alfalfa hay will not shed rain or snow water.\r\nIf there is much moisture and it is convenient to do so, use a layer of\r\nstraw or dry hay of some kind every five or six feet. Keep the stack\r\nfull in the middle, or a little higher than the sides, and well tramped\r\nall the time. When the stack has reached the desired height, top it out\r\nwith slough grass, or dry timothy or prairie hay, or very green alfalfa,\r\nor protect with tarpaulins or boards; the boards may be nailed and\r\nchained together, lapped and weighted at the corners, making a very\r\nsatisfactory roof. If these directions are followed, the losses will be\r\nkept at a minimum. The Kansas experiment station authorities say that in\r\nan experiment made there an application of salt to the hay when being\r\nstored seemed to decrease, if anything, rather than increase its feeding\r\nvalue. Lime applied in stacking is claimed to have a beneficial effect\r\nin preventing mold.\r\n\r\nThe raised bottom and layers of straw are useful accessories for the\r\nstack, shed or mow, while the barrel or other ventilating contrivances\r\nshould not be overlooked in either sheds or mows.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING AS SILAGE\r\n\r\nAs land values increase and farmers and dairymen come to more fully\r\nappreciate the worth of green feed in winter, the silo grows in\r\nestimation. Eastern farmers who keep cows or young stock of any kind use\r\nthe silo more or less, to conserve for winter the value of both green\r\ngrass and corn. Alfalfa makes an excellent silage, but its peculiar\r\nquality of retaining its green food value, as hay, when properly cured,\r\nmakes its ensiling much less a necessity. Alfalfa hay taken from the mow\r\nin February, green, appetizing and nutritious, falls little, if any,\r\nshort of serving the purposes of silage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFTEN PROFITABLE TO ENSILE THE FIRST CUTTING\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not infrequently found that the first cutting of alfalfa\r\nmay be ensiled directly from the field at a season when rains would\r\nprevent its proper curing for hay. If this is done, it is important that\r\nthe rakes and wagons follow very closely after the mower, as even two\r\nhours of sun exposure in the swath lessens its value for silage. Men who\r\nhave cut alfalfa during a light rain and raked and hauled it directly\r\nto the silo have reported satisfactory results. Others report having cut\r\nit in the late afternoon and, the next morning, after a heavy rain,\r\nraked and hauled it to the silo while dripping wet. Therefore the farmer\r\nin the eastern and southern states, in the Pacific Northwest, or even in\r\nthe central states may, on occasion, plan for the ensiling of his first\r\ncutting, in the faith that it will come out in fine condition if his\r\nsilo is properly constructed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR SILOING\r\n\r\nThe Kansas and Colorado experiment stations recommend that alfalfa for\r\nsilage should be cut into lengths of, say, two inches. Long alfalfa does\r\nnot pack sufficiently close in the silo, and when so stored the loss is\r\nmuch more than if in short lengths. It should always be heavily weighted\r\nand great care taken to pack it well at the outer edges. Round silos are\r\nmost approved because their contents are more readily compacted. The\r\npoints urged by Professor Ten Eyck, of the Kansas experiment station,\r\nare, (a) getting the alfalfa to the silo quickly after mowing, allowing\r\nlittle, if any, curing; (b) cutting the alfalfa into short lengths\r\nrather than storing it whole; (c) packing it tightly, and weighting\r\nheavily when all in. He says, however, that if the weather will permit\r\nproper curing of the alfalfa, it will make more valuable winter feed as\r\nhay than as silage.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALING\r\n\r\nThe increasing general demand for alfalfa hay in the city markets of the\r\nUnited States, away from the distinct alfalfa regions, has made finding\r\na method of preparing it for economic shipment of much importance. The\r\ncompressing of timothy and prairie hay has become so general that\r\nalfalfa raisers and shippers are also following this method. The problem\r\nof saving the leaves, and, at the same time, being able to market\r\nalfalfa green, has been hard to solve. Baling it uncured meant mold, and\r\nbaling it when very dry meant loss of leaves and, hence, loss in feeding\r\nand selling value. The Kansas station a few years ago carried on a\r\nseries of experiments extending over several years from which the\r\nconclusion was that the only safe procedure is to cure carefully in the\r\nfield, put in the stack or mow, and bale after the final sweating--say\r\nthirty days. Most of the hay cured and baled in the field was moldy or\r\nbrown. It is possible, however, that a more careful curing, the use of\r\nhay-caps, letting it stand for several days in cock, baling, and then\r\nstoring in an open shed, the bales stacked on edge and separated about\r\nevery third layer by poles, rails or rafters, might result in securing\r\nhigh-grade hay direct from the field without stacking. Seemingly it will\r\nnever be safe, away from the semi-arid regions, to bale the first\r\ncutting from the field; but the secret may yet be found of so baling the\r\nsecond and third cuttings and obtaining prime hay. Its doing is not\r\nlikely to prove satisfactory, however, except in the drier portions of\r\nthe alfalfa district where large cocks of, say, 500 pounds may be made\r\nand left standing for several days before baling. But baling is not\r\nlikely to be largely followed except in territory where extensive areas\r\nare devoted to alfalfa. When practically every farmer in the United\r\nStates has his field of alfalfa as he now has of corn, cotton or clover,\r\nthe greater part of the product will be fed on the farm and the surplus\r\nhauled direct to the local markets. Western Kansas and Nebraska alfalfa\r\nraisers are having this problem solved for them by the growing practice\r\nof stockmen shipping cattle and sheep from the mountain ranges to be fed\r\nor fattened where the hay is raised, and hauled directly from the stack\r\nto the feed lots.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR STUFF\r\n\r\nHay dealers report that much of the baled alfalfa shipped is poor stuff.\r\nThey advise small bales, weighing about sixty to eighty pounds; about 27\r\nto 36 inches long, 14 or 15 inches thick and 18 inches high when laid on\r\nedge. They also recommend that in loading a car the bales be placed on\r\ntheir edges instead of on the sides, as they are less liable to heat.\r\nThe problem of the city hay dealer is to sell what he has received, with\r\nsatisfaction to the purchaser and profit to himself and to his client.\r\nIf he receives moldy, dead hay, with little protein value, he is not\r\nable to please his customer, not able to secure a good price, and hence,\r\nnot able to please either shipper or buyer. The farmer who raises and\r\nships hay and receives two dollars less per ton for it than his\r\nneighbor, should learn by such money losses the necessity of harvesting\r\nand storing his product properly.\r\n\r\nA. S. Hitchcock says in Farmers’ Bulletin No. 215, of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, that the baled hay for export to Alaska,\r\nHawaii, and other trans-oceanic points is compressed by the process\r\nknown as double compression, done with baling machines operated by\r\nelectricity or hydraulic power. The hay obtained by loosening the\r\nordinary bale is compressed into square or cylindrical packages of\r\nsmaller and more compact form than the ordinary bale. The hydraulic\r\npresses used for making the round bales are similar to those used for\r\nthe cylindrical bales of cotton. The measurements of the different types\r\nof double-compressed bales are about as follows: Square, 15 by 18 by 38\r\ninches, weight 160 pounds; square bale for Alaskan trade, 14 by 18 by 26\r\ninches, weight 100 pounds; round bale, 2 feet in diameter, 24 inches\r\nlong, weight 145 pounds, or 36 inches long, weight 260 pounds. The\r\nsaving of space in transit may best be understood by comparing the\r\nweight and cubic contents of baled and compressed hay. The ordinary bale\r\noccupies 140 to 160 cubic feet per ton, and round bales 55 feet per ton.\r\nThe most essential point in loading new hay into a car is to see that it\r\nis not loaded flat, that is, with the flat sides of the bale up. When\r\nloaded in this way, with the smooth sides of the bales together, no\r\nspace is left for air and as a consequence the hay not infrequently\r\nheats. A properly loaded car has the edges or rough sides of the bales\r\ntogether. This allows air space between the bales and always prevents\r\ndanger of heating.\r\n\r\nA new machine is being introduced which makes (from the windrow if\r\ndesired) a cylindrical bale, with a hollow space lengthwise through its\r\nmiddle. This open space must undoubtedly facilitate the curing of hay\r\nbaled before sufficiently dry. The machine has a capacity of four to six\r\ntons per hour, makes a bale thirty-six inches long and twenty inches or\r\nless in diameter, as desired, bound with twine, and the hay can be eaten\r\nfrom the bale, with a minimum of waste, without unfastening. This\r\nbaler, if it justifies the claims of its inventors, should be very\r\nuseful to those who grow alfalfa for marketing away from the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRADING AND GRADES OF ALFALFA HAY\r\n\r\nOn account of the increasing demands for alfalfa hay, and growth in the\r\nbusiness of selling it in cities, dealers have found that the\r\nestablishment of some uniform and generally accepted method of grading\r\nthe different qualities was a business necessity. As a result of this\r\nits consideration was taken up by the National Hay Association’s\r\ncommittee on grades and upon the committee’s recommendation the\r\nassociation in 1905 adopted the following classification:\r\n\r\nChoice Alfalfa--Shall be reasonably fine, leafy alfalfa, of bright green\r\ncolor, properly cured, sound, sweet and well baled.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 Alfalfa--Shall be coarse alfalfa of bright, green color, or\r\nreasonably fine, leafy, of good color, and may contain five per cent of\r\nforeign grasses; must be well baled, sound and sweet.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 Alfalfa--Shall include alfalfa somewhat bleached, but of fair\r\ncolor, reasonably leafy, not more than one-eighth foreign grasses, sound\r\nand well baled.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 Alfalfa--Shall include bleached alfalfa, or alfalfa mixed with not\r\nto exceed one-fourth foreign grasses, but when mixed must be of fair\r\ncolor, sound and well baled.\r\n\r\nNo Grade Alfalfa--Shall include all alfalfa not good enough for other\r\ngrades, caked, musty, grassy, or threshed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lattice Rack for Feeding Alfalfa to Cattle]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box Rack for Feeding Alfalfa to Sheep]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lattice Rack for Feeding Alfalfa to Sheep]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box Rack for Feeding Alfalfa to Cattle]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IX._\r\n\r\nPasturing and Soiling\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTURING NOT ALWAYS ECONOMY\r\n\r\nIts perennial nature and the reports of its wonderfully productive and\r\nnutritive qualities might naturally lead the farmer, without better\r\nacquaintance, to suppose that with alfalfa he has perpetual pasture;\r\nthat he will open the gate to his live stock in the spring, send for the\r\nbutcher or buyer in October, and then winter in luxurious leisure. But\r\nhe finds that the easiest is not always the most profitable way.\r\nPasturing with any stock is an expensive and extravagant method of\r\ngathering a valuable crop from high-priced land. Where land is cheap and\r\npasture is wild, stock are not expensive help in gathering a cheap crop;\r\nbut it is easily demonstrated that when land values are high and a crop\r\nvalue is in a like altitude, man with machinery can do the harvesting\r\nmore economically than can a cow, a steer or even a sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nALFALFA A TENDER PLANT\r\n\r\nIn some respects alfalfa does not seem to be a natural pasture plant.\r\nThe stems are delicate, it will not thrive in a hard, trampled soil, and\r\nthe crowns when broken off will not revive; if some of the plants bloom\r\nand drop their flowers early in the season, they lose vigor and many of\r\nthem die. These peculiarities would at least indicate that it should\r\nnot be pastured at all until it has become established, has its crowns\r\nwell spread, has abundant stems and its roots have a strong start on\r\ntheir underground career. Not an animal should be turned on an alfalfa\r\nfield until the second or third year if it is desired that the stand\r\nendure for several years, nor should it be pastured too early in the\r\nspring or too late in the fall. There should be something of a growth\r\nleft for winter protection. Careful alfalfa raisers are known who\r\npasture their older fields, but never put on a full quota of stock until\r\nthey have cut over the field when the plants are first coming into\r\nbloom. They insist that this cutting invigorates and gives the plants\r\nnew life. They then pasture quite closely until some time in September,\r\nafter which there is time for some final growth for winter protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD SWINE PASTURE\r\n\r\nA chief exception that most farmers insist on is that it is an excellent\r\npasture for pigs and, if it is not stocked too heavily, its use for\r\ngrazing young swine will not largely decrease the yield of hay. Its\r\nmarked protein property seems to give to the pigs a superior growth of\r\nframe and flesh. Farmers claim that pigs a few weeks old turned into an\r\nalfalfa field derive almost their entire living from it and leave the\r\nsows two weeks earlier than other pigs, coming in September with a gain\r\nof from 100 to 125 pounds, while the field has yielded its three\r\ncuttings of hay. Of course, if too many pigs are grazed, the hay yield\r\nwill be less. But even here the question of labor _versus_ hay must be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGERS TO CATTLE AND SHEEP\r\n\r\nThe greatest objection to pasturing alfalfa is its bloating cattle and\r\nsheep. Hogs and horses do not suffer, although a Texas farmer writes\r\nthat he lost some pigs from something similar to bloat that he\r\nattributed to the alfalfa. But this may be considered questionable, as\r\nthousands have regularly pastured hogs and horses on alfalfa with no\r\nsymptoms of bloat. From hundreds of inquiries sent out by the experiment\r\nstations, it is determined that over ninety per cent of those who have\r\npastured cattle or sheep on alfalfa have lost one or more animals by\r\ndoing so, yet many report having pastured the same kind of stock on\r\nalfalfa for years, regularly every season, without loss. Careful\r\ninvestigations have been made with the purpose of finding out why some\r\nhave been immune while others suffered. Since, in the cases of loss,\r\nonly a small proportion of the animals pastured are affected, it may be\r\ninferred that much depends upon the nature and condition of the\r\nindividual animal. Practically every western station has carefully\r\nexperimented, following the directions of men who have been free from\r\nloss, yet it has cost each station valuable animals.\r\n\r\nHorse stock of all ages find alfalfa pasturage conducive to growth,\r\nfattening, and their general health. If the foliage is short and scant,\r\nhorses are severe on the fields used in winter because they are able to\r\ncrop close, and not infrequently paw loose dirt away from the plants,\r\nbiting off the crowns a fourth or even half inch below the surface of\r\nthe ground. It is easy to understand the loss of the bud or growing\r\npoint may be detrimental to the growth and usefulness of the plants,\r\ncausing many to die, resulting in bare spots later to be overgrown by\r\nnoxious weeds and grasses. After the damage is done there remains no\r\nremedy but to plow up the field and reseed, or to disk thoroughly and\r\nthen reseed the bare spots. If the field has not deteriorated too much,\r\nthe latter is much to be preferred. By diligence and careful treatment,\r\nor prompt action closely following any encroachments upon the life of\r\nthe plants, the quality and yield may be maintained and the profits\r\nrelatively enhanced. Alfalfa has wonderful recuperative powers, but\r\ncontinuous nipping of the crowns will do most serious harm and\r\neventually decrease the yield not a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCES WITH CATTLE\r\n\r\nOne man reports turning eighty steers into one alfalfa field where there\r\nwas running water, and a second herd into another field without running\r\nwater, but water ran through a wild grass meadow adjoining, into which\r\nthis herd was driven every afternoon and turned back into the alfalfa\r\nthe next morning. The first herd suffered no loss, while five valuable\r\nanimals died in the second field on the second day, before they could be\r\nremoved. When all were put into the first field there was no more bloat.\r\nAnother reported turning cows into a small field where there was a\r\ntrough full of water all the time. Here, as in the case of the steers, a\r\nfull feed was given before the cows were turned on the alfalfa. Before\r\nnoon one cow had to be relieved by a trocar, and another by being driven\r\nrapidly about the field. The wherefores of such occurrences present a\r\nproblem yet to be solved. Certainly there is more danger in pasturing\r\ncows and sheep on alfalfa than most people care to risk. Aside from the\r\nfinancial loss, there is, also, the humane side of the question.\r\n\r\nA very fair statement, representative of those made by parties who\r\npasture cattle on alfalfa without losses from bloat, is the following,\r\ngiven to the author by Mr. S. C. Hanna, an extensive and reputable\r\nbreeder of Shorthorns, in Elk county, (southern) Kansas, who says:\r\n\r\n“I have been pasturing alfalfa successfully without bloating my cattle\r\nfor a number of years; in fact, I have never lost an animal from alfalfa\r\nbloat. As I am raising high priced, pure bred Shorthorns and graze them\r\non my meadows more or less at all times of year, I always sow a good\r\nmixture of English blue-grass (_Festuca elatior_) and orchard grass\r\n(_Dactylis glomerata_) with it, making alfalfa the base and principal\r\nseeding. I am very partial to orchard grass in this mixture because it\r\nmakes considerable hay, and springs up so quickly after each mowing. In\r\nthis section orchard grass is a stayer, and will hold its own against\r\nall comers.\r\n\r\n“I always am cautious when we first turn the cattle on alfalfa, seeing\r\nto it that they have a good fill on something else beforehand, and hold\r\nthem at first on some part of the field where the mixed grasses are the\r\nthickest, so they can graze there first. In twenty minutes they will be\r\nsafe to go where they wish, and may be allowed to run at will\r\nthereafter. I find, however, that on the clear alfalfa meadows there is\r\nalmost no danger from bloat after the plants have begun to bloom. I\r\nusually have some hay stacked in the pastures, that the cattle may run\r\nto. I have, however, pastured alfalfa in all stages where there would be\r\nperhaps twenty acres of alfalfa in one place, and some prairie grass\r\nand also tame grasses in the same enclosure, and had no bloat. This has\r\nbeen, too, sometimes in May and June, when showers were frequent and the\r\nalfalfa most succulent. It would seem that the cattle will take care of\r\nthemselves if they have a good chance. I usually superintend these\r\nchanges personally, and see that all conditions are right.\r\n\r\n“I find we get almost as much hay from the mixed fields as from the\r\nexclusively alfalfa meadows, and the fall aftermath is much better. The\r\ntheory that alfalfa will not flourish with the other grasses is wrong.\r\nMy favorite meadows contain a mixture of this kind, including some red\r\nclover, and I have cut four good crops of hay from them this season,\r\nafter pasturing moderately from March 15 to May 1. I always get the\r\nstock horses and mules on pasture by March 15, and the cattle about\r\nApril 1, and move them to wild grass prairie pasture about May 1, except\r\na few that we will keep on the meadows all season. These we change from\r\none field to another when the alfalfa becomes tall enough to be trampled\r\ndown or damaged.\r\n\r\n“If my object was only to raise hay for market, I would sow the alfalfa\r\nalone and keep the stock off altogether, but for my purpose I prefer a\r\nmixture. By doing my way I never miss a good stand, and the mixture\r\nkeeps down the foxtail and crab grass. I have been sowing this mixture\r\nfor about fifteen years, and have over 300 acres.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. F. Stodder of Cowley county, Kansas, a prominent breeder of pure\r\nbred cattle, makes this statement to the author, which is simply further\r\ntestimony that a mixture of other grasses with alfalfa intended for\r\ngrazing greatly diminishes, if it does not entirely eliminate, the risk\r\nand dangers of bloat:\r\n\r\n“I have several fields of mixed grasses. These contain enough alfalfa so\r\nthat we cut them for hay at regular times, and the proportion of grasses\r\nand alfalfa is largely in favor of the latter. In such fields as these I\r\npasture cattle at will, and have never seen any evidence of bloat\r\ntherefrom. But my experience with the straight alfalfa fields leads me\r\nto be very cautious. I find that I can pasture them at times without\r\ndanger, and at other times a large proportion of the cattle will bloat.\r\nIt is possible that I have made the statement that I never lost cattle\r\nby pasturing alfalfa, which is true, because we have always been lucky\r\nenough to discover the ailing animals in time to give them relief.”\r\n\r\nMr. F. S. Kirk of Oklahoma, mentioned in Chapter III, pastures his\r\ncattle on alfalfa in fall and spring, but does not give them access to\r\nhis meadows in the morning until the dew has dried off, and for only\r\ntwenty or thirty minutes the first day or two; then for an hour or two\r\nfor a few days, and after that they are left in the pastures until\r\nsundown.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERALLY DANGEROUS TO SHEEP\r\n\r\nExperiments with sheep seem to be even more disastrous than with cattle.\r\nIn an investigation conducted by the Colorado station, losses were\r\nreported by nearly every man who had pastured sheep on alfalfa. Some\r\nlost but one or two, while others lost forty or fifty. A few reported\r\nthat each spring they lost a few sheep the first day they were on the\r\npasture, and then no more, and that the losses of old sheep were of less\r\nimportance than the growth of the lambs, these being seldom affected by\r\nbloat. Most, however, advised that the old should not be turned on\r\nalfalfa under any circumstances, but that lambs, if well fed in the\r\nmorning, let on the alfalfa after the dew was off and then kept there\r\nnight and day would do well, and the loss be smaller than that in a\r\nnormal season from other causes. J. E. Wing states that his loss from\r\npasturing lambs on alfalfa in Ohio is less than it formerly was from one\r\nor two parasitic diseases that never trouble alfalfa-pastured lambs. He\r\ngives his lambs a full feed in the morning, turns them on the alfalfa\r\nfield about ten o’clock, and leaves them there continuously until\r\nSeptember. He begins the pasturing just before the seasons first growth\r\nof the alfalfa blooms.\r\n\r\nWhile by no means without risk, pasturing sheep on alfalfa is not always\r\nnecessarily fatal and the following, related in the _Breeder’s Gazette_\r\nby Mr. C. H. Williams of Powell county, Montana, is interesting:\r\n\r\n“We have been pasturing sheep in large numbers on alfalfa for the past\r\neight years. We have lost from bloat as many as 26 in one day from a\r\nflock of 1600, but we seldom lose one now. We find they are much more\r\napt to bloat on windy days; more especially if the wind blows from the\r\nsouth and is soft and balmy. This may seem strange, but we believe it a\r\nfact. We have in our employ a shepherd who has during the greater part\r\nof his life herded sheep on alfalfa in the vicinity of Pau and d’Oloron,\r\nFrance. The day we lost 26 ewes from bloat this man was several miles\r\nfrom the home ranch. When visited by the camptender he remarked: ‘This\r\nwill be a bad day for the old ewes on the alfalfa.’ Why so? ‘Because the\r\nwind is soft and warm,’ said he. That afternoon we found 26 dead.\r\n\r\n“Our French shepherd has a simple and never failing remedy for bloat\r\nfrom alfalfa or clover. It is simply a half-pint of sweet milk\r\nadministered to the animal when found bloated. I saved a fine ram lamb\r\nthe other day. He was fearfully bloated, unable to walk and scarcely\r\nable to breathe. I found an old can in the road, hastened to the\r\npasture, milked a half pint of milk from a cow, set the lamb on his rump\r\nand poured the milk down his throat. In a half hour he was all right and\r\nfollowing the flock. Milk from a ewe will answer just as well. We have\r\nadopted the following rules: Never allow the sheep to go on alfalfa\r\npasture when very hungry; if possible get a little dry feed in their\r\nstomachs in the morning before going to the alfalfa; watch them closely\r\non windy days, and have the herders carry a bottle of sweet milk.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA POSSIBLE EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nThe most of the losses reported were of animals which had been taken off\r\nthe pasture at night and turned back the second morning when hungry and\r\neager to graze. Yet there are reports of severe losses the first day,\r\neven after a full feed. Possibly it will be found that the animals that\r\nsuffer from bloat are not in good physical condition, and are more\r\nnervous and greedy in their habit of eating than those not affected. It\r\nmay be that an intelligent sorting of the animals to be turned on the\r\npasture might save loss. It is also quite generally believed that\r\nalfalfa growing on uplands is less liable to cause bloat than that\r\nraised on bottom lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR PASTURING\r\n\r\nThe most generally approved rules in regard to pasturing are:\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the pasturing season give animals a heavy feeding in\r\nthe morning before turning upon the alfalfa.\r\n\r\nHave water in the pasture all the time.\r\n\r\nKeep the animals in the pasture night and day, after they have become\r\naccustomed to it, until removed permanently.\r\n\r\nUse upland in preference to bottom fields for pasture.\r\n\r\nWatch the stock closely the first few days and remove permanently\r\nanimals that show symptoms of bloat.\r\n\r\nSow blue-grass, brome grass, or meadow fescue with alfalfa in fields\r\nintended for permanent pasture.\r\n\r\nThe following valuable information upon bloat (_tympanitis_) and its\r\ntreatment was prepared by Nelson S. Mayo, formerly professor of\r\nveterinary science at the Kansas agricultural college:\r\n\r\n“Bloating, in all cases, is accumulation of gas in the stomach or\r\nintestines, or both, but more particularly in the paunch (rumen). This\r\ngas is produced by a fermentation, similar to that observed when cider\r\nis ‘working’ and the gas escapes in bubbles. There is usually a small\r\nquantity of gas given off from the food during normal, healthy\r\ndigestion, but so small that it causes no trouble, and passes off\r\nreadily through the intestines, though sometimes from the stomach, up\r\nthe esophagus, and out of the nose or mouth--‘belched up,’ as it is\r\ncommonly expressed. These gases which cause an animal to bloat are\r\ngenerated in considerable quantities if a large amount of juicy, green\r\nfood is eaten. Alfalfa, clover and frozen roots are very liable to\r\nproduce bloating.\r\n\r\n“It is well known that only part of the animals in a herd pasturing upon\r\nclover or alfalfa bloat; so the blame cannot be laid entirely upon the\r\nfood, but is probably the result of a slight derangement of the\r\ndigestive organs, not ordinarily noticed, but easily aggravated by\r\ncertain foods which ferment easily. Animals that are ailing are very\r\nliable to bloat when turned on alfalfa pastures. Alfalfa and clover are\r\nmuch more liable to produce bloating if wet with rain or dew, and\r\nespecially hoar frost, and animals are more apt to bloat if turned into\r\nthe pastures when very hungry, as they gorge themselves, and the food is\r\nnot properly masticated. Hence, cattle should not be allowed to go\r\nhungry to the pastures.\r\n\r\n“It is generally believed by those who have had considerable experience\r\nin pasturing clover or alfalfa, that cattle and sheep are less liable to\r\nbloat if they have free access to dry food, such as hay or straw. Common\r\nbloating, or hoove, occurs in animals having a compound stomach and that\r\nchew the cud--ruminants, as they are called. Of our common domestic\r\nanimals, cattle and sheep belong to this order.\r\n\r\n“One of the first symptoms noticed is that the animal stops feeding, and\r\nremains lagging behind or stands by itself. Rumination, or chewing of\r\nthe cud, is suspended; the animal appears dull and listless, the back\r\nslightly arched; the whole abdomen or belly is distended with a\r\nprominent swelling on the left side just forward of the point of the\r\nhip. If the swelling is tapped lightly with the fingers there is a\r\nhollow, drum-like sound; hence the technical name, _tympanitis_.\r\n\r\n“The rumen being distended with gas not only makes the animal appear\r\nmuch fuller than usual, but it presses forward on the diaphragm, or\r\n‘midriff,’ and this presses against the lungs, and interferes seriously\r\nwith the animal’s breathing. The breath is short and rapid. The animal\r\noften grunts, or moans, with each breath. The animal’s nose protrudes,\r\nand there is a driveling of saliva from the mouth. Sometimes there are\r\nquite severe colicky pains, shown by the animal’s kicking at its belly\r\nand stepping about uneasily. Sometimes, also, the pressure is so great\r\nas to cause eversion or bulging out of the rectum. The symptoms of\r\nbloating are so prominent, especially when the history of the case is\r\ntaken into account, as to make this disease very easy to recognize, even\r\nby an ordinary observer.\r\n\r\n“When animals die from bloating, death usually takes place in the\r\nfollowing manner: The diaphragm is pressed against the lungs so hard\r\nthat the animal cannot breathe, and it dies of suffocation. Animals\r\nusually remain standing until near the end, when they gradually lose\r\nconsciousness, stagger, and fall, and in falling rupture some of the\r\nvital organs.\r\n\r\n“Treatment must depend somewhat upon the condition of the animal. If the\r\nanimal is badly bloated, with labored breathing and staggering gait,\r\nenergetic measures must be resorted to at once. The best and most\r\nsatisfactory treatment for bad cases is tapping. This consists in making\r\na hole through the skin and muscles, over the prominent swelling on the\r\nleft side, into the rumen or ‘paunch,’ thus allowing the gas to escape\r\nat once, relieving the animal.\r\n\r\n“The best method of tapping is by means of an instrument called a\r\n_trocar_ and _cannula_. A trocar is a sharp-pointed instrument, five or\r\nsix inches long, and about the size of a lead pencil, with a handle at\r\none end. Over the point of the trocar slips a tube, called a cannula,\r\nnot quite as long as the trocar, with a wide flange around the upper end\r\nof the tube, as shown in the illustration herewith.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROCAR AND CANNULA\r\n\r\n“To use a trocar and cannula, proceed as follows: Tie the animal so it\r\ncannot get away. With a sharp knife, make a small incision through the\r\nskin over the prominent part of the swelling on the left side. This\r\nincision should be made about half way between the point of the hip and\r\nthe last rib, and should be large enough to admit the trocar and cannula\r\nreadily. The incision should be made quickly; then the animal will not\r\nnotice it. After the incision is made the trocar and cannula are pushed\r\nquickly in and directed downward, inward, and forward; push the trocar\r\nin until the flange of the cannula rests against the skin. Withdraw the\r\ntrocar and the gas will rush out; that is, it usually does so;\r\noccasionally, however, the end of the cannula is plugged up with green\r\nfood. This can usually be remedied by pulling out the cannula part way,\r\nor pushing the trocar in again and withdrawing it. If this doesn’t work,\r\ntap the stomach again in another place, using the same hole through the\r\nskin. The escape of gas is usually accompanied by a small quantity of\r\ngreen food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trocar and Cannula]\r\n\r\n“If a trocar and cannula are not available in an urgent case, a knife\r\ncan be used very successfully--a good-sized pocket knife blade, pushed\r\nquickly through the skin and muscles, in the same manner as described\r\nfor the trocar and cannula. Care must be taken that the sharp edge of\r\nthe blade is not turned towards the animal’s tail, as it sometimes jumps\r\nforward, and a much larger hole is cut than was originally intended.\r\n\r\n“A careful and observing stockman of Colorado, who has had a large\r\nexperience with alfalfa bloating, informs me that he prefers a\r\nmoderately small, sharp butcher knife to either a trocar and cannula or\r\na pocket knife. It gives relief quicker and with no bad effects.\r\nSometimes, if the opening through the skin is small, made by a small\r\nknife, a quill or small tube is fastened in to keep the incision open,\r\nso the gas can escape. It is usually necessary to keep the incision open\r\nfor several hours. The only bad result of tapping is that occasionally\r\ngreen food gets outside of the rumen into the abdominal cavity in\r\nsufficient quantities to cause inflammation and death; but if the\r\noperation is intelligently performed, these bad results are extremely\r\nrare--probably not more than one case in 100. If the weather is warm,\r\ncare should be taken that flies do not bother the wound in the skin.\r\n\r\n“If the case is not severe enough to warrant tapping, the following\r\nremedies will be found useful: A gag made by winding a good-sized rope\r\nback of the horns and through the mouth, or a bit, made of a piece of\r\nwood the size of a fork handle, can be tied in the animal’s mouth. The\r\nbit should be smooth, to prevent injuring the mouth. Then a small\r\nhandful of salt should be thrown well back on the roots of the tongue.\r\nThis causes the animal to work its tongue, increases the flow of saliva,\r\nand thus favors the regurgitation, or gulping up, of the gas. The salt\r\nand saliva swallowed help to stop fermentation.\r\n\r\n“Blankets wrung out of cold water and wrapped around the abdomen or\r\nbelly, or cold water dashed on with a bucket, often give relief.\r\nTurpentine given as a drench, in milk sufficient that it will not\r\nirritate the animal, is good, two ounces of turpentine for adult cattle\r\nand one-half ounce for sheep being a dose. Hyposulphite of soda,\r\ndissolved in water and given as a drench, is good; one ounce for cattle\r\nand two drachms for sheep. This can be repeated every half hour for two\r\nor three doses. Aqua ammonia, two ounces for cattle and one-half ounce\r\nfor sheep, well diluted with water; carbolic acid, cattle 30 drops,\r\nsheep 8 to 10 drops in sufficient water; common soda, in half-ounce\r\ndoses for cattle and one-half drachm for sheep, can be given. In giving\r\nmedicine as drenches, they should be well diluted with water or other\r\nsubstances until they will not burn when touched to the tongue. In\r\ngiving drenches, be careful and not choke the animal. If the animal\r\ncoughs or struggles violently, stop at once until it recovers somewhat.\r\nGive drenches slowly.\r\n\r\n“Drenches are mostly administered from a long-necked, thick, glass\r\nbottle, or drenching horn. Take hold of the nose with the left hand, by\r\nputting the thumb and finger in the nostrils, while an assistant takes\r\nhold of the horns, and tips the head back. Standing on the right side of\r\nthe animal, with the right hand put the neck of the bottle in the right\r\ncorner of the mouth, and pour the medicine in slowly. After the bloating\r\nhas been relieved, it is a good plan to give the animal a purgative--one\r\npound of Epsom salts, with one-half pound common salt, for cattle; and\r\nfor a sheep, six ounces of Epsom salts and three ounces of common salt,\r\ndissolved in plenty of warm water, and given as a drench. The animals\r\nshould also be dieted until their digestive organs regain their normal\r\ncondition. By dieting, I do not mean starving, but plenty of easily\r\ndigested and nutritious food. An animal that bloats once is very liable\r\nto bloat again. By judicious handling and feeding, by watching animals\r\nclosely, and treating them in time, few will be lost by alfalfa\r\nbloating.”\r\n\r\n\r\nALFALFA AS A SOILING CROP\r\n\r\nAlfalfa may be cut for soiling just when it contains the highest per\r\ncent of protein, while if pastured some is eaten before its best period,\r\nthe most of it after that point is reached, and probably a large portion\r\nof the leaves is lost entirely. Cut for soiling and fed daily, when\r\nwilted, there is less danger from bloat, as in this way animals will eat\r\nstalks as well as leaves: the entire product is used and there is no\r\nloss from trampling the fields nor by plants being covered and smothered\r\nwith animal droppings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME COMPARISONS\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska station reports that in an experiment there it required .71\r\nof an acre to keep a cow for a given time by soiling, while by pasturing\r\nit required 3.63 acres; also that the cows kept on pasture during the\r\nexperiment actually consumed more grain than those that were soiled.\r\nThis report further states that while the pastured cows gave more milk\r\neach day, the cost of production was greater. By another experiment with\r\ncows for a single year it was indicated (Bul. No. 69) “that about twice\r\nas much feed was secured from the land when the alfalfa was soiled as\r\nwhen it was pastured. The average daily production of milk and of\r\nbutterfat was markedly greater when the crop was pastured than when\r\nsoiled. In one test this amounted to one-third more, but in the other\r\ntest the difference was not so great. The profits from soiling as\r\ncompared with pasturing will depend largely on two factors--the price of\r\nlabor and the value of the land.”\r\n\r\nA western Kansas farmer writes that one acre of alfalfa cut daily for\r\nsoiling maintained as many cows as he was able to keep on a five-acre\r\nfield used as pasture.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas station reported that in an experiment, lasting 144 days, the\r\ncows on alfalfa pasture returned an income, less cost of grain fed, of\r\n$4.23, while cows soiled on alfalfa cut and fed green returned an\r\nincome, less the grain fed, of $18.08. This station also reported that a\r\nneighboring dairyman maintained ten milch cows for a whole summer,\r\nwithout any grain, on two acres of alfalfa, cut and fed to them fresh\r\nthree times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA METHOD FOR THE SMALL FARMER\r\n\r\nIn the Central West where labor is scarce and land comparatively low in\r\nprice, farmers are not likely to adopt the soiling system while such\r\nconditions exist; but east of the Mississippi river, and especially in\r\nNew York, Pennsylvania and New England, where land is high and labor\r\nscarce, alfalfa offers great possibilities as a soiling crop. The small\r\nfarmer who now cannot afford to raise many pigs, because he does not\r\nraise enough corn to fatten them, will find that by soiling alfalfa he\r\ncan maintain from May to September from five acres as many as ten cows\r\nand fifty pigs; and that these pigs, with some grain from the first of\r\nAugust, while being fed green alfalfa, may by the middle of November be\r\nmade ready for market. If he has another five acres of alfalfa for hay,\r\nit will yield enough in three cuttings to go far toward wintering his\r\ncows, a team of horses, and his sows. His ten acres will be growing\r\nricher every year, and at the end of five years be in prime condition to\r\nyield him big returns in corn, wheat, or potatoes and other vegetables.\r\nAlfalfa is distinctly a crop adapted to the small farmer, everywhere;\r\nthere is, as a rule, little question that this method of utilizing it\r\nbrings much greater returns per acre than if it were used as pasturage\r\nor hay.\r\n\r\nGreen alfalfa when pastured, (barring bloat), or cut and fed daily is\r\npeculiarly valuable for all such young stock as colts, lambs, calves and\r\npigs. It tends to develop strength of bone and hastens the growth of\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Alfalfa Field in Central New York=\r\n\r\nShowing growth August 22, 1907, seven days after third cutting]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Fourth Cutting of Alfalfa in Shawnee County, Kansas=\r\n\r\nPhoto taken in September]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =A Second Cutting of Alfalfa (July 28) in Shawnee County,\r\nEastern Kansas=\r\n\r\nThis was sown on the last half of the preceding September.

Not only do all\r\nanimals like it, but when given in moderate quantities it seems to\r\nincrease the general appetite for more fat-making feeds. Steers\r\nbeginning to “fall off” on a heavy diet of corn will come to their\r\nappetites after being fed only a few pounds of alfalfa daily, and will\r\neat and assimilate more corn than before.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa alone is not a fat-making feed. Animals fed upon it grow in\r\nweight, but the weight is principally of bone, blood and muscle. It is\r\nwithout a sufficiency of fat and carbohydrates, and these should be\r\nadded in such foods as corn, corn meal, Kafir corn, or Kafir corn meal;\r\nor to a limited degree even in corn stover, sorghum or millet. When\r\nalfalfa is fed alone all the protein cannot be digested, and, therefore,\r\nit is always economical to add some carbonaceous foods, if animals are\r\nfattening for market.\r\n\r\nFor several years feeders have been deploring the fact that fattening\r\nmainly with corn was becoming less and less profitable. When they began\r\nto figure the exact cost of each pound of gain on a steer or hog, they\r\nsaw clearly that corn alone made the pound of gain cost too much;\r\nsometimes as much as it was worth in the market, leaving neither profit\r\nnor interest on the investment. The problem then became how to produce\r\nthe pound of meat more economically.\r\n\r\nSuch a condition has prompted the state stations to make tests to\r\ndetermine the feeding value of various articles, and especially the\r\nvalue of alfalfa as a balance to the more carbonaceous foods. The tables\r\nhere appended are worth studying:\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD VALUE OF SEVERAL FODDER CROPS\r\n\r\n(From New York experiment station Bul.

These tests and investigations extended\r\ncontinuously through a period of five years, and following are the more\r\nimportant facts developed and the conclusions that may be legitimately\r\ndrawn from them, as summarized (Bul. No. 61) by Profs. Luther Foster and\r\nL. A. Merrill who supervised the work:\r\n\r\n1. The largest annual yield of hay per acre is obtained by the method of\r\nearly cutting and the lowest by the late, the average result standing as\r\nfollows: early cutting, 100; medium, 92; and late, 85.\r\n\r\n2. The early cut alfalfa contains the highest per cent of protein and\r\nfat, the most valuable food constituents, and the lowest per cent of\r\ncrude fiber, the most indigestible portion. The former decrease\r\nconstantly while the latter increases rapidly from early bloom to the\r\nfull maturity of the plant.\r\n\r\n3. The proportionate amount of leaves to stems is greater at early bloom\r\nthat at any subsequent time, and both leaves and stems contain a greater\r\nper cent of protein and a less per cent of crude fiber at this time than\r\nat any later period in the growth of the plant. The relative proportion\r\nof leaves to stems in the different cuttings is as follows: early, 42 to\r\n58; medium, 40 to 60; and late, 33 to 67.\r\n\r\n4. Alfalfa leaves as compared with stems are very much richer in\r\nprotein, fat and nitrogen-free extract, and they contain a much smaller\r\nproportion of crude fiber. The per cent of the protein and fat grows\r\nconstantly less, and that of the crude fiber greater, from the time of\r\nearly bloom to maturity. The average composition of all cuttings and\r\ncrops shows the leaves to contain 150 per cent more protein than the\r\nstems, 300 per cent more fat, 35 per cent more nitrogen-free extract,\r\nand 256 per cent less crude fiber.\r\n\r\n5. The more important nutrients, protein and fat, have the highest per\r\ncent of digestibility in the early cuttings and it grows less and less\r\nwith the age of the plant.\r\n\r\n6. In the feeding tests, the highest gains were made from the early\r\ncuttings and the lowest from the late, the results standing\r\nproportionately as follows: early cutting, 100; medium, 85; and late,\r\n75.\r\n\r\n7. The variation in the amount of the different cuttings eaten per day\r\nwas very slight, being the highest for the early cutting and the lowest\r\nfor the late, but the quantity of dry matter and also of digestible\r\nmatter required for a pound of gain was decidedly lowest for the early\r\ncutting and highest for the late, the relative amounts of dry matter\r\nstanding as follows: early cutting, 100; medium, 131; and late, 166.\r\n\r\n8. The annual beef product per acre was largest from the early cuttings,\r\nnot only in the general average but in each separate season’s test, and\r\nthat from the late cuttings was smallest, the proportional products\r\nstanding as follows: early cutting, 100; medium, 79¹⁄₂; and late, 69¹⁄₂.\r\n\r\n9. Taking all points of comparison into consideration, both separately\r\nand collectively, including everything that pertains to the largest\r\nyield and the highest feeding value, the tests favor cutting alfalfa for\r\ncattle feeding when the first blooms appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROP COMPARISONS\r\n\r\n10. The first crop gave the largest yield in each of the five tests and\r\nin fourteen out of the fifteen cuttings, while the third crop gave the\r\nlowest for every test and in every cutting but one. The average acre\r\nyields for the five years, including all cuttings, stand in the\r\nfollowing relation: first crop, 100; second, 78; and third, 39; for the\r\nearly cuttings alone, first crop, 100; second, 83; and third, 66.\r\n\r\n11. In the average composition of all cuttings for three years, the\r\nnutrients of the three crops vary but little. The second has slightly\r\nthe highest per cent of protein and fiber; and the third the most fat\r\nand nitrogen-free extract.\r\n\r\n12. The third crop has the largest proportion of leaves to stems; but\r\nthe per cent of protein in the leaves is highest in the second crop; and\r\nnext highest in the first. The leaves of the first crop contain the most\r\nfat and of the second, the least.\r\n\r\n13. The third crop produced a higher average rate of gain in the feeding\r\ntests than the first or second and also higher than any of the separate\r\ncuttings. The amount eaten daily was also highest of all, but the dry\r\nmatter and digestible matter for a pound of gain were the lowest. In a\r\npound per pound comparison the gains stood as follows: first crop, 100;\r\nsecond, 81; and third, 126; dry matter for a pound of gain, first crop,\r\n100; second, 115; and third, 69.\r\n\r\n14. The beef product per acre, taking the average result of all cuttings\r\nfor the five years, was very much the highest for the first crop and\r\ndecidedly the lowest for the third, standing as follows: first crop,\r\n100; second, 61; and third, 45. But taking the early cuttings alone they\r\nstand, first crop, 100; second, 80; and third, 69.\r\n\r\n15. Pound for pound, taken as a whole, the results show the highest\r\nfeeding value for the third crop and the lowest for the second.\r\n\r\n16. The average annual beef product from early cut alfalfa was 705.61\r\npounds per acre; it required 9575 pounds of timothy to produce an equal\r\nweight; 11,967 pounds of red clover, and 10,083 pounds of shredded corn\r\nfodder.\r\n\r\nProf. John A.

No. 26) Prof. W. W. Cooke compared an acre\r\nof dent (Golden Beauty) corn, planted May 16 and harvested September 21,\r\nwith returns from an acre of alfalfa on an adjoining plat, three years\r\nseeded. The corn crop was a fair one, and including ears and stalks\r\nweighed 15,500 pounds, containing 35.62 per cent or 5539 pounds of dry\r\nmatter. The alfalfa yielded three cuttings of hay weighing respectively\r\n4600, 3350 and 3250 pounds, or 5.6 tons, containing 10,304 pounds of dry\r\nmatter. But, as Professor Cooke says, this is not quite a fair\r\ncomparison, for a pound of dry matter from the corn crop is more\r\ndigestible and has a higher feeding value than an equal amount from the\r\nalfalfa. The corn crop contained 3605 pounds of digestible feeding\r\nmaterial, while the alfalfa crop contained 5611 pounds, or a little more\r\nthan half as much again. The corn crop per acre in feeding value was\r\nequivalent to three and a half tons of alfalfa hay.\r\n\r\nThe total digestible nutrients of the two crops are presented in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n                     |     TOTAL       |   DIGESTIBLE\r\n                     +--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                     |  Corn  |Alfalfa |  Corn  |Alfalfa\r\n  -------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                     |_Pounds_|_Pounds_|_Pounds_|_Pounds_\r\n  Dry matter         |  5,539 | 10,304 |  3,605 |  5,611\r\n  Albuminoids        |    405 |  1,602 |    296 |  1,198\r\n  Starch, sugar, etc.|  3,263 |  4,782 |  2,186 |  3,114\r\n  Fiber              |  1,472 |  2,800 |  1,060 |  1,198\r\n  Fat (ether extract)|     84 |    246 |     63 |    101\r\n  Ash                |    315 |    829 |   .... |   ....\r\n  -------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE VALUES OF ALFALFA HAY AND OTHER FEED STUFFS FOR PROTEIN\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------+------------------------------\r\n                                 |Value per ton when prairie hay\r\n                                 |      is worth per ton--\r\n            Feedstuff            |  $2.00  |  $3.00  |   $4.00\r\n  -------------------------------+---------+---------+----------\r\n  Alfalfa hay (average)          |  $6.05  |  $9.08  |  $12.11\r\n  Red clover hay                 |   3.88  |   5.82  |    7.77\r\n  Orchard-grass hay              |   2.74  |   4.11  |    5.48\r\n  Millet hay                     |   2.57  |   3.85  |    5.14\r\n  Timothy hay                    |   1.65  |   2.48  |    3.31\r\n  Sorghum hay                    |   1.37  |   2.05  |    2.74\r\n  Corn-fodder (stover)           |   1.14  |   1.71  |    2.28\r\n  Oat straw                      |    .91  |   1.37  |    1.82\r\n  Wheat straw                    |    .45  |    .68  |     .91\r\n  Sugar beets                    |    .62  |    .94  |    1.25\r\n  Mangel-wurzels                 |    .57  |    .85  |    1.14\r\n  Alfalfa hay containing 12.9 per|         |         |\r\n  cent digestible protein        |   7.36  |  11.05  |   14.73\r\n  Wheat bran                     |   7.02  |  10.53  |   14.04\r\n  -------------------------------+---------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nIt is seen that the alfalfa yielded nearly twice as many pounds of dry\r\nmatter as the corn, with the digestible nutrients far in the lead, and\r\nthe protein of the alfalfa was three times that of the corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALANCED RATION\r\n\r\nNo feeder can learn to use alfalfa, or in fact any forage or grain, in\r\nthe most economical way until he understands somewhat the compounding of\r\na balanced ration. All foodstuffs for either man or beast are, as\r\nalready stated, made up of three classes of substances--namely, protein\r\nor proteids, carbohydrates and fats. The animal’s digestive and\r\nassimilative organs are so constructed that it cannot use these three\r\nclasses of substances interchangeably; in other words, an animal fed\r\nwholly upon any one of these three would be in process of gradual\r\nstarvation. Given in the proportions needed to best supply the vital\r\norgans of the body, these substances become the sustenance for animal\r\nlife and growth. The protein builds up the brain, nerves, muscles and\r\nother tissues in which the life force is active, and without protein\r\nthere would be no life.\r\n\r\nTo balance a ration for domestic animals is to so adjust the quantity of\r\ndigestible proteids, fats and carbohydrates it contains that the animal\r\neconomy may use each without waste. The balanced ration means an\r\neconomical ration, allowing the digestive organs to work at their\r\nhighest efficiency; an unbalanced ration is one in which one of the\r\nthree classes of food substances is in excess, or is deficient. Fed such\r\na ration, the animal retaliates upon its owner by failure to digest the\r\nexcess, which is worse than wasted; for the feeding of any class of\r\nsubstances in excess adds to the labor of the digestive organs and\r\nreduces their efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING A BALANCED RATION\r\n\r\nIn Press Bulletin No. 12, from the Kansas station, the following is\r\ngiven to illustrate somewhat how a balanced ration would differ from\r\nothers into which consideration of a proper balance had not entered:\r\n\r\n“There are three important groups of substances in feeds--protein,\r\ncarbohydrates, and fat. Protein includes all materials in feeds which\r\ncontain nitrogen. It enters into the composition of milk, blood, muscle,\r\nhair and the brain and nerves; is necessary in the formation of these,\r\nand no other substance can take its place. Protein is also used in the\r\nbody in producing heat, energy and fat. Carbohydrates include the fiber\r\nof feeds, the sugars, starch, and gums, and furnish heat, energy and fat\r\nin the body. Carbohydrates and fat can take each other’s places, one\r\npound of fat being worth 2.2 pounds of carbohydrates for production of\r\nheat in the body.\r\n\r\n“Extended investigations have shown that to obtain the best results,\r\nfeed should be given which will furnish these materials in the following\r\nproportions:\r\n\r\n“Dairy cow--protein, 2¹⁄₂ pounds; carbohydrates, 12¹⁄₂ pounds; fat, ¹⁄₂\r\npound.\r\n\r\n“Fattening steer--protein, 2¹⁄₂ to 3 pounds; carbohydrates, 15 pounds;\r\nfat, ¹⁄₂ to ³⁄₄ pound.\r\n\r\n“Growing cattle--protein, 4 pounds; carbohydrates, 13¹⁄₂ pounds; fat, 2\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n“For a young animal (cattle) gradually decrease the proportion of\r\nprotein until at the age of two years the proportions are similar to\r\nthose for the fattening steer, but less in quantity. A pig two to three\r\nmonths old needs feeds containing seven and one-half pounds of protein\r\nto each thirty pounds of carbohydrates and fat, while a year-old pig\r\nneeds seven and one-half pounds of protein to each forty-eight pounds of\r\ncarbohydrates and fat. Feeds containing a greater proportion of protein\r\nthan called for by these standards can be fed, because protein can take\r\nthe place of the other materials. Carbohydrates and fat cannot take the\r\nplace of protein, however, and no matter in how large quantities they\r\nmay be fed, if protein is lacking, the growth or gain will be less.\r\n\r\n“The weak point in feeding is that the average rations are greatly\r\ndeficient in protein, and have too much carbohydrates and fat. Every\r\nfeeder knows that good pasturage produces rapid growth, good gains, and\r\nabundant milk yields. It furnishes nutriment in the proportion of three\r\npounds of protein, twelve pounds of carbohydrates, and one-half pound of\r\nfat. The proportions in some of our feeds in pounds per 100 pounds of\r\nfeed, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  -----------+-------+--------+-----\r\n             |       | Carbo- |\r\n             |Protein|hydrates| Fat\r\n  -----------+-------+--------+-----\r\n  Corn       |  7.8  |  66.7  | 1.6\r\n  Kafir-corn |  7.8  |  57.1  | 2.7\r\n  Prairie hay|  3.5  |  41.8  | 1.4\r\n  Corn fodder|  2.0  |  33.2  | 0.6\r\n  Sorghum hay|  2.4  |  40.6  | 1.2\r\n  -----------+-------+--------+-----\r\n\r\n“It will be seen that none of these contain a sufficient proportion of\r\nprotein to secure best results, and all combinations of these feeds will\r\nhave the same defect.\r\n\r\n“Some feeds have too great a proportion of protein to be fed alone, as\r\nshown below, the figures indicating pounds per 100 pounds of feed:\r\n\r\n  -----------------+-------+--------+------\r\n                   |       | Carbo- |\r\n                   |Protein|hydrates| Fat\r\n  -----------------+-------+--------+------\r\n  Alfalfa hay      |  10.6 |  37.3  |  1.4\r\n  Gluten-meal      |  31.1 |  43.9  |  4.8\r\n  Linseed-oil meal |  28.8 |  32.8  |  7.1\r\n  Cottonseed-meal  |  37.0 |  16.5  | 12.6\r\n  Soy-beans        |  39.6 |  22.3  | 14.4\r\n  -----------------+-------+--------+------\r\n\r\n“Making a balanced ration is combining the feeds deficient in protein\r\nwith those having an excess of it, to make a ration which will contain\r\nthe right proportions for the animals fed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATIONS IN ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nVariations in the foregoing tables would indicate that the analysis is\r\nlikely to vary with the product of different soils and different\r\ncultivations. In spite of variations it may be readily seen that alfalfa\r\nwith its high protein value makes a very effective and economical\r\nbalance for corn for heavy feeding. When it is taken into consideration\r\nthat this forage so rich in protein can be raised at home, and that its\r\ngrowing is at the same time enriching the soil, the conclusion is easy\r\nthat alfalfa hay may profitably constitute a part of all the fattening\r\noperations; it is also clear that the economical way to market alfalfa\r\nis through the farm’s live stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XI._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa in Beef-Making\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cattle feeder is not much given to sentiment and cares less for the\r\nbeauty of the purple flowers of the alfalfa than he does for the best\r\nmethod of converting those purple flowers and the accompanying foliage\r\ninto marketable beef. An accepted but unwritten rule of cornfeeding is\r\nthat 1000 pounds of grain with ordinary forage will produce 100 pounds\r\nof gain, under normal conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME FEEDING TESTS\r\n\r\nThe Kansas station in a careful feeding test of 153 days produced 100\r\npounds of gain with 718 pounds of grain by using alfalfa hay for\r\nroughness. This test also gave the following table of gain in values,\r\nfrom the use of different feeds in the same given time:\r\n\r\n  Corn and alfalfa hay    $109.74\r\n  Corn and prairie hay      56.96\r\n  Corn and sorghum hay      27.09\r\n  Corn and oat straw        43.28\r\n  Barley and alfalfa hay    57.16\r\n\r\nThe Utah station after a feeding test published the statement that to\r\nproduce 705.61 pounds of beef it required:\r\n\r\n  Of alfalfa hay            7,182 pounds\r\n  Of timothy hay            9,575   „\r\n  Of red clover hay        11,967   „\r\n  Of shredded corn fodder  10,083   „\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Kansas Farmer Viewing One of His Alfalfa Fields=\r\n\r\nShowing ten days’ growth after first cutting in 1907]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harvesting Alfalfa in Ohio]\r\n\r\nAt this station steers made a most rapid gain when fed upon early cut\r\nalfalfa hay, either with or without an accompanying ration of grain. “By\r\nearly cut hay was meant hay cut just before bloom. The gain upon this\r\nearly cut alfalfa hay was one-third more than that upon hay cut when in\r\nfull bloom or later.”\r\n\r\nThe Utah station also reports a cattle feeding test (Bul. No. 61) in\r\nwhich 100 pounds of gain from feeding alfalfa hay cost $3.76; from\r\ntimothy, $4.71, and from corn fodder, $6.21.\r\n\r\nAt the Nebraska station Prof. Howard R. Smith (Buls. 85 and 90) fed 50\r\nyearling and 50 two-year-old grade steers in lots of ten for six months,\r\neach lot of each fifty having rations different from the others, and the\r\ntable herewith shows the average cost per pound of gain made by each\r\nsteer of each lot of yearlings:\r\n\r\n  Lot fed corn and prairie hay                          8.27 cents\r\n   „   „  corn 90 per cent, oil meal 10 per cent, and\r\n          prairie hay                                   6.82   „\r\n   „   „  corn 90 per cent, oil meal 10 per cent, and\r\n          corn stover                                   6.09   „\r\n   „   „  corn 90 per cent, oil meal 10 per cent, and\r\n          sorghum hay                                   7.00   „\r\n   „   „  corn and alfalfa hay                          6.04   „\r\n\r\nBelow is shown the cost under similar conditions with the two-year-olds,\r\n(the cost of the corn and oil meal fed them having been slightly greater\r\nthan that fed the yearlings):\r\n\r\n  Lot fed corn and prairie hay                          8.23 cents\r\n   „   „  corn 90 per cent, oil meal 10 per cent, and\r\n          prairie hay                                   8.27   „\r\n   „   „  corn 90 per cent, oil meal 10 per cent, and\r\n          corn stover                                   6.49   „\r\n   „   „  corn 90 per cent, oil meal 10 per cent, and\r\n          sorghum hay                                   7.87   „\r\n   „   „  corn and alfalfa hay                          6.89   „\r\n\r\nAmong the deductions from these experiments, Professor Smith records the\r\nfollowing, bearing upon the use of alfalfa:\r\n\r\n“Alfalfa is much superior to prairie hay when the grain consists of corn\r\nalone. It also proved to be a cheaper source of protein than oil meal.\r\nThe returns on the cattle fed alfalfa hay, were the alfalfa figured at\r\n$11.14 per ton, would have been as great as the returns on prairie hay\r\nat $6 per ton, with corn as the grain ration at 39 cents per bushel. In\r\ncomparison with prairie hay at $6 when oil meal worth $28 per ton was a\r\npart of the grain ration, the alfalfa returned a value of $8.28 per ton.\r\n(In these experiments the cost of all alfalfa hay and all prairie hay\r\nwas figured at the one price of $6 per ton.--Author.)\r\n\r\n“Bright, well-cured corn stover fed with an equal weight of alfalfa, the\r\ngrain consisting of corn alone, gave slightly larger gains than corn and\r\nalfalfa, and proved the most economical ration in the experiment. The\r\naddition of corn stover may have improved, to some extent, the corn and\r\nalfalfa ration by furnishing greater variety, and by its tendency to\r\ncheck scours sometimes caused by alfalfa. The stover fed with alfalfa\r\nreturned a value of $4.57 per ton in comparison with alfalfa at $6 per\r\nton as the sole roughness.\r\n\r\n“By feeding alfalfa hay, which is a protein-rich roughness, extremely\r\npalatable and readily masticated, in place of prairie hay with corn\r\nalone, 14 per cent less grain was required for each pound of gain on\r\ntwo-year-olds and 27 per cent less on yearlings.\r\n\r\n“Alfalfa hay, fed once per day in connection with corn and well-cured\r\ncornstalks, furnished sufficient protein for two-year-olds to make the\r\nthree foods a combination producing heavy and very economical\r\ngains--more economical than any other ration in the experiment.\r\n\r\n“Alfalfa is pronouncedly superior to prairie hay for beef production,\r\nand the more rapid the extension of the area of land devoted to the\r\nproduction of alfalfa, supplanting the less valuable and lower yielding\r\nnative hay, the more rapid will be the production of wealth from our\r\nsoil.”\r\n\r\nOne authority who has made a study of such problems says, “steers can be\r\nfattened on one-third less corn with alfalfa for roughness than\r\nwithout.”\r\n\r\nW. H. Jordan, director of the New York (Geneva) experiment station says:\r\n“Probably no species of forage are known that are more economical\r\nsources of high-class cattle food than alfalfa and corn, and if in the\r\nrealms of stock raising corn is king, alfalfa is queen.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING TOO MUCH ALFALFA\r\n\r\nMany feeders make the mistake of feeding too much alfalfa hay to young\r\nsteers grained heavily on corn. Careful tests seem to prove that cattle\r\non a heavy feed of corn, corn meal, Kafir-corn or Kafir-corn meal gain\r\nas much with 15 or 20 pounds of alfalfa hay per day as by having 35\r\npounds, the very common quantity in feeding. It is also reported by\r\nexperienced feeders that steers over three years old may be fattened on\r\nalfalfa with a moderate feed of corn, while for younger steers the heavy\r\nfeed should be corn with 15 to 25 pounds of alfalfa hay per day.\r\n\r\nA Colorado feeder put a lot of steers nearly four years old on a daily\r\nration of ten pounds of corn chop and fifteen pounds of alfalfa hay for\r\n100 days. The gain was surprising and the steers weighed on the Denver\r\nmarket about 1430 pounds per head.\r\n\r\nA feeder in Osborne county, Kansas, reported to the author the\r\nfollowing: “Began feeding 22 two-year-old steers on February 3rd,\r\naveraging 941 pounds in weight. Gave them no feed but alfalfa hay until\r\nMarch 4th. From March 4th until May 1st fed all the alfalfa they wanted\r\nand 243 bushels of corn chop, when they weighed out at an average gain\r\nof 259 pounds each in 86 days, or three pounds per day on a feed of 11\r\nbushels of corn chop and plenty of alfalfa hay per steer.”\r\n\r\nWestern feeders generally claim to be able to put fat cattle on the\r\nmarket from 20 to 30 per cent cheaper with alfalfa as the balance than\r\non corn alone, or with corn and bran or any purchased protein foods. The\r\ncheapest beef-making in the West is the raising of calves on alfalfa,\r\nand at 20 to 24 months fattening them by a heavy feeding of corn and\r\nalfalfa hay for 100 days. Cattle carried to 1000 to 1200 pounds on\r\nalfalfa, and then finished by strong feeding on corn with alfalfa hay\r\nfor fifty to sixty days, make beef of a choice quality at a low cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XII._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa and the Dairy\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING A MARGIN\r\n\r\nThe most enthusiastic advocates of alfalfa are dairymen. The market\r\nprice of milk is quite well fixed and the price of butterfat at the\r\ncreameries remains, in the different seasons, pretty much the same year\r\nby year. Hence, the problem of increasing his financial returns must\r\ndepend upon the dairyman’s being able to increase the volume of his\r\nproduct or to decrease the cost, or both. If he is selling butterfat at\r\na profit of five cents and he cannot force the price any higher, it is\r\nthe sensible thing to decrease the cost per pound and thereby enlarge\r\nhis profit.\r\n\r\nThe dairyman who buys all his feed has but little margin. To raise\r\nenough clover calls for considerable land. Alfalfa will yield a large\r\nbulk of excellent feed from a few acres of well treated land. For profit\r\nhe must raise more feedstuff and buy less. The Kansas station reported\r\nthat with common scrub cows fed on alfalfa hay and Kafir corn meal it\r\nwas possible to produce butterfat at a cost of seven cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME MILKING TEST VALUATIONS\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey station as a result of a very painstaking milking test\r\nreported: (1) In a ration where alfalfa hay was tested against wheat\r\nbran and dried brewers’ grain the saving in the cost of milk was 12.7\r\ncents per hundred, and 2.3 cents per pound of butter when alfalfa hay\r\nwas used. This saving means a great deal when it is considered that the\r\nalfalfa is raised and not purchased. (2) That the milk value of one acre\r\nof alfalfa was $74.\r\n\r\nA Kansas dairyman is reported to have kept ten cows through one summer\r\non the alfalfa cut daily from a patch containing four square rods less\r\nthan two acres.\r\n\r\nSome dairymen believe that there is a great saving in the alfalfa hay by\r\ncutting it into two-inch lengths, and feeding it dry. It is also\r\nbelieved that it will always be a matter of economy to feed with the\r\nalfalfa, green or as hay, a small ration of carbonaceous food, even\r\ncorn-stover serving such a purpose.\r\n\r\nFormer Governor Hoard, editor of _Hoard’s Dairyman_, says that with\r\nalfalfa hay at $10 and bran at $20 per ton there is a saving, by using\r\nalfalfa, of $2.80 for every 100 pounds of butter made, and a saving of\r\n19.8 cents for every 100 pounds of milk.\r\n\r\nIn a section of New York where alfalfa has been quite generally\r\nintroduced, dairymen claim an increase in their profits of 15 to 30 per\r\ncent by its use, besides the enrichment of their farms for other crops.\r\n\r\nProf. D. H. Otis, telling of experiments with the dairy herd at the\r\nKansas agricultural college, states that, “it is usually recommended to\r\nfeed a cow all the rough feed she will eat, and then balance up the\r\nration with grain. The experience at the college indicates that much\r\nrough feed is wasted in careless feeding. The cow will eat the best\r\nfirst, and, if given too much, will pick the most desirable morsels,\r\nleaving what might be called passably good, which too frequently is\r\ntreated as waste and thrown under foot. No more hay should be given an\r\nanimal than it will eat up clean. This refers to first-class quality,\r\nhowever, as a cow could not be expected to eat poor hay clean.\r\n\r\n“In feeding the rough feeds, the following table has been used by the\r\ncollege as a guide:\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   ROUGHNESS.--Value per ton when alfalfa is worth $1.00 per ton\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-----------------+---------+-----\r\n                 | Total |Protein|                 | Total |Protein\r\n                 | nutri-| nutri-|                 | nutri-| nutri-\r\n       FEED      | ents  |  ents |     FEED        | ents  |  ents\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-----------------+-------+-------\r\n  DRY ROUGHNESS  |       |       |GREEN ROUGHNESS  |       |\r\n    Alfalfa      | $1.00 | $1.00 |  Alfalfa        | $0.34 | $0.37\r\n    Corn-fodder  |   .32 |   .19 |  Corn silage    |   .13 |   .12\r\n    Cowpeas      |   .97 |  1.02 |  Fodder corn    |   .14 |   .09\r\n    Fodder Corn  |   .40 |   .24 |  Pasture grasses|   .03 |   .24\r\n    Millet       |   .64 |   .42 |  Sorghum fodder |   .12 |   .06\r\n    Oat hay      |   .59 |   .41 |  Soy-beans      |   .28 |   .30\r\n    Oat straw    |   .33 |   .15 |                 |       |\r\n    Orchard-grass|   .60 |   .45 |ROOTS AND TUBERS |       |\r\n    Prairie hay  |   .51 |   .33 |  Mangels        |   .10 |   .09\r\n    Red clover   |   .70 |   .64 |  Sugar-beets    |   .14 |   .10\r\n    Sorghum      |   .43 |   .23 |  Turnips        |   .11 |   .08\r\n    Soy-beans    |   .98 |  1.02 |                 |       |\r\n    Mixed hay    |   .67 |   .56 |                 |       |\r\n    Timothy      |   .47 |   .27 |                 |       |\r\n    Wheat straw  |   .25 |   .08 |                 |       |\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-----------------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n“Students working with the dairy herd were anxious to have the cows make\r\nthe best possible yields, and were tempted to give all the good alfalfa\r\nhay the cows would eat. When we discovered the alfalfa hay going too\r\nrapidly we looked for the cause and found that the dairy cows had\r\nconsumed an average of forty-three pounds per head daily, besides\r\nfifteen pounds of Kafir corn fodder. The quantity of alfalfa was reduced\r\nto thirty-three pounds and the Kafir-corn fodder to three and one-half\r\npounds daily per cow, and we found that the daily yield of milk was\r\nslightly increased. The quality of the hay was the same in both\r\ninstances. In the latter case it was eaten up clean, while in the former\r\nconsiderable was hauled away and fed to dry cows. Later records show a\r\nstill greater reduction in the allowance of alfalfa without decreasing\r\nthe flow of milk. This experience shows some of the leaks that may take\r\nplace in feeding roughness, especially when those feeds are appetizing,\r\nlike alfalfa and red clover.\r\n\r\n“For ease of calculation the roughness is figured on the basis of\r\nalfalfa hay selling for one dollar per ton. When alfalfa is worth six\r\ndollars per ton the other rough feeds are worth six times the amount\r\nindicated in the table; when alfalfa is worth eight dollars per ton the\r\nother feeds are worth eight times as much, and so on. Usually we find\r\nthat we can give practically all the rough feed that the cows can eat,\r\nalthough, as indicated above, with a good quality of alfalfa or clover\r\nhay more may be eaten than will be consumed at a profit. At this writing\r\nalfalfa hay is selling in Manhattan at seven dollars per ton. This would\r\nmake the feeding values of the other rough feeds worth seven times the\r\namount indicated in the table. Red clover, for instance, would be worth\r\nseven times seventy cents or $4.90 per ton; prairie hay would be worth\r\n$3.57 per ton; and millet hay would be worth $4.48 per ton. If the\r\nproblem was to select the most economical roughness, we would select\r\nalfalfa at seven dollars per ton, in preference to red clover at six\r\ndollars per ton, or prairie hay at four dollars per ton, or millet at\r\nfive dollars per ton. Knowing the cost of these different rough feeds\r\nand having this table before him, a feeder can tell which is the most\r\neconomical feed to use. It will be noticed that the table is divided\r\ninto two parts, the first part giving the value of the total nutrients,\r\nand the second one the value of the protein nutrients. It frequently\r\nhappens that we have plenty of carbohydrates and fat, but that we are\r\nlacking in protein. In this case we would consult the ‘protein\r\nnutrients’ column in order to determine what feed to buy in order to\r\nfurnish the protein most economically. If it be carbohydrates and fat as\r\nwell as protein that is required, as was the condition in the dry year\r\nof 1901, then we should take the total nutrients’ column. When it is\r\npossible to get a rough feed containing a large amount of protein, we\r\nfind that in feeding a liberal allowance of roughness the grain can be\r\nreduced. Hence, the importance of providing roughness rich in protein,\r\nlike alfalfa.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSELLING FARM PRODUCTS THROUGH THE COW\r\n\r\nNo other branch of agriculture presents more advantages than\r\ndairying--disposing of the products of the farm as milk and butterfat.\r\nWhen the latter may be sold to creamery stations and the skim milk fed\r\nto calves and pigs along with alfalfa the profits are greater than from\r\nalmost any other form of agriculture. No other business tends so rapidly\r\nto build up the fertility of the farm, and, when judiciously conducted,\r\nno other branch of farming yields more satisfactory financial returns.\r\nRaising and feeding alfalfa will add from 15 to 30 per cent to the\r\nprofits of dairying over the use of any other feedstuff that may be\r\nraised or bought. The profit problem for the dairyman is constantly to\r\nfind the feed that will decrease the cost of his production.\r\n\r\nThe diagram below, prepared by the editor of the _Nebraska Farmer_, is\r\nto “represent the digestible protein or milk property contained in\r\ndifferent kinds of roughness. Points represent the decimals of a pound,\r\nand the bars are an exact representation of the superiority of one kind\r\nof food over another for the production of milk.

S. Hitchcock cites as an illustration of feeding alfalfa alone, the\r\ncase of the dairy farms in the vicinity of Moneta, Cal., where the stock\r\nare ordinarily fed no other ration than alfalfa. As alfalfa is not a\r\nbalanced ration, a number of local dairymen tried to replace a part of\r\nthe alfalfa by sorghum, thus giving a more nearly balanced ration. The\r\ncows, however, did not give as much milk upon this combination as upon\r\npure alfalfa. “This result may be assigned to the fact that the cattle\r\nwere unable to consume a sufficient quantity of the mixture to produce\r\nthe same results as the alfalfa alone. These dairymen find they can\r\nsecure a larger yield by feeding a little grain; but the increased yield\r\ndoes not pay for the grain, which is high priced in this locality.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ESSENTIAL IN MILK PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nOscar Erf, professor of dairying at the Kansas experiment station,\r\nwriting for this volume, says: “Alfalfa is quite indispensable in\r\nsuccessful dairy operations, being one of the cheapest sources of\r\nprotein, that most essential compound in feeds for milk production. The\r\nKansas station found that for milk 1¹⁄₄ pounds of well-leaved alfalfa\r\nhay, containing a high per cent of protein, is equal in feeding value to\r\na pound of bran. In case the alfalfa is of a stemmy nature it requires\r\n1³⁄₄ pounds to equal the feeding value of a pound of bran. Alfalfa hay\r\nis worth from $4 to $7 per ton on the farm, while bran costs from $14 to\r\n$20 per ton, hence it is far more economical to feed the alfalfa hay.\r\n\r\n“Like other hays alfalfa varies in composition according to the time of\r\ncutting, the soil on which it grows, and its per cent of leaves. It has\r\nbeen found that three-fourths of a pound of alfalfa hay is equal in\r\nfeeding value to a pound of clover hay of equal brightness and quality.\r\nA good stand of clover yields about 2¹⁄₂ tons per acre per year, while a\r\ngood stand of alfalfa yields about 5 tons per acre per year. Hence, on\r\nan acre of land, 1100 pounds of protein can be produced by raising\r\nalfalfa while only 340 pounds can be produced by growing clover, the\r\nprotein in the alfalfa and that in the clover being equally digestible.\r\nThis comparison is chosen from the fact that clover is the next cheaper\r\nsource of protein found on the farm.\r\n\r\n“At the Kansas station the following experiment was conducted, and\r\nillustrates the low cost of a ration including alfalfa hay for roughness\r\nas compared with a ration in which prairie hay was used. The experiment\r\nwas with ten cows. The first ration consisted of 21 pounds of alfalfa\r\nhay and 9 pounds of corn. While the cows were on this ration each\r\nproduced an average 26 pounds of milk per day, the milk containing 3.9\r\nper cent of butterfat. To formulate a ration from prairie hay and bran\r\nwhich had the same amount of nutrients, we were obliged to feed 19\r\npounds of bran and 15 of hay. Fed on this each cow produced only 24\r\npounds of milk per day, containing 4 per cent of butterfat. The 21\r\npounds of alfalfa hay at $7 per ton, which is rather a high estimate,\r\nand 9 pounds of corn at 70 cents per hundred weight cost 13.6 cents per\r\nday. At this rate it cost 3¹⁄₃ cents to produce a gallon of milk, or\r\napproximately 13.5 cents for a pound of butterfat. Estimating bran at\r\n$16 per ton and prairie hay at $5 per ton, the cost of the second ration\r\nwas 18.95 cents per day, and milk approximately 7 cents per gallon,\r\nmaking the butterfat worth 19.7 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n“The following two tables show the difference in cost between a ration\r\nin which alfalfa is used for part of the roughness and one which\r\ncontains no alfalfa but has the same amount of digestible nutrients:\r\n\r\n  Alfalfa hay      19 lbs at $ 7.00 per ton   $ .066\r\n  Corn              7 lbs at    .70 per cwt     .049\r\n  Bran           2¹⁄₂ lbs at  18.00 per ton     .0225\r\n                                              -------\r\n                                              $ .1375\r\n\r\n  Sorghum hay      10 lbs at $ 3.50 per ton   $ .0175\r\n  Prairie hay      12 lbs at   6.00 per ton     .036\r\n  Ground wheat      8 lbs at    .80 per bu      .1066\r\n  Cottonseed meal   3 lbs at  24.00 per ton     .036\r\n                                              -------\r\n                                              $ .1961\r\n\r\n“As shown by the table a gain of 5.86 cents is made by feeding the\r\nalfalfa. Being a proteinaceous feed it can to a great extent be\r\nsubstituted for cottonseed meal, linseed meal or gluten meal, and will\r\nentirely substitute other leguminous hays and forages, such as soy bean\r\nhay, cowpea hay, clover hay and vetch hay, any one of which is more\r\nexpensive, for nutrients contained, than alfalfa hay.\r\n\r\n“The Kansas station has found it practicable, from results obtained in\r\nthe past three years, to ensile green alfalfa for dairy cows. This is\r\nsuperior to dry alfalfa, owing to its succulent nature. In the eastern\r\npart of the United States ensiling alfalfa has another advantage in that\r\nall cuttings can be harvested in perfect condition. As a rule the first\r\ncutting throughout this whole territory is liable to be damaged more or\r\nless by rains. By putting the green alfalfa into a well constructed silo\r\nthis loss can be obviated and the full value retained. For example: a\r\nman has 40 acres of alfalfa, from which he harvests for the first crop\r\n1¹⁄₂ tons per acre. Estimating the price of good, clean alfalfa hay at\r\n$7 a ton, this would be worth $420. Should the hay be damaged by rain\r\nits value would be greatly reduced and, as has been the case for many\r\nyears, such damaged hay could be purchased for $2 or less per ton.\r\nAccordingly this damaged hay would be worth $120. The loss caused by\r\nrain would therefore be $300. Put into the silo this first cutting would\r\nbe equal in value to the best bright hay.\r\n\r\n“The cost of a 100-ton silo is $250, hence the owner could not only save\r\nthe first cutting, but money besides. Furthermore, it is not\r\ninfrequently the case that alfalfa of the first cutting is of a stemmy\r\nnature, and it has been estimated that fully 28 per cent of such hay is\r\nwasted when fed to cows, as they do not eat the coarse stems. This loss\r\ncan be entirely eliminated by the siloing, for cows will readily eat the\r\nstems as silage.\r\n\r\n“The value of alfalfa silage in influencing the milk flow was indicated\r\nwhen a ration was fed to sixteen cows, in which 12 pounds of alfalfa\r\nhay, 20 pounds of corn silage, 5 pounds of bran and 4 pounds of corn\r\nmeal were used; this ration was afterward changed by substituting\r\nalfalfa silage for the corn silage, and at the same time the bran was\r\nreduced to 1 pound, and the corn increased 1 pound. By these changes the\r\nmilk was increased 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n“With butterfat worth 23 cents a pound the value of a ton of alfalfa\r\nsilage has been estimated at approximately $8. This silage solves the\r\nproblem of feeding cows economically in summer, as well as in winter,\r\nunder a system of intensive farming.”\r\n\r\nW. J. Fraser, chief in dairy husbandry at the University of Illinois,\r\nsays: “Corn silage and alfalfa, two of the best feeds for dairy cows,\r\nmake practically a complete or balanced ration in themselves. Several\r\nyears’ experience in supplying the university dairy herd with various\r\nkinds of soiling crops in midsummer has led to this high recommendation\r\nof corn silage and alfalfa.”\r\n\r\nAlfalfa hay has much the same laxative effect as June pasture. An Elgin,\r\nIll., dairyman, with fifty cows, says: “Every month I feed alfalfa in\r\nwinter gives me a month in which I have practically pasture conditions.\r\nThe cows show the pasture-effect in the glossy condition of their hair\r\nand in the yield of milk, and have never before looked quite so well.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIII._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa for Swine\r\n\r\n\r\nHOGS WILL EAT HAY\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter it was stated that alfalfa is a valuable\r\npasture or soiling crop for pigs. It is equally true that they will\r\nactually eat alfalfa hay. A hog is not usually ranked as a hay-eating\r\nanimal but an exception must be made as to his eating alfalfa hay. As a\r\npasture or soiling crop for sows and young pigs, alfalfa proves a\r\nwonderfully helpful ration for milk-making in the sow and for growth in\r\nthe pigs. Experiments have shown that pigs make better growth when the\r\ndam is fed considerable alfalfa than those from sows fed the best of\r\ncommercial rations, but with no alfalfa. Given two sets of pigs, one fed\r\nclover, rape and soaked corn and the other fed only alfalfa forage, the\r\nlatter seemed to grow the more rapidly. For brood sows it is a most\r\nvaluable food, either as hay, a soiling crop, or as pasture. The litters\r\nof such sows are generally large and vigorous and the dams have a strong\r\nflow of nutritious milk. Alfalfa meal in slop may be used with profit\r\nwhere the hay is not to be obtained. It is also claimed that sows fed on\r\nalfalfa during pregnancy will not devour their young, its mineral\r\nelements seeming to satisfy the appetite of the sow, while contributing\r\nto the fetal development of the pigs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Five-year-old Alfalfa=\r\n\r\nat the time of its third cutting. September 8, and its root development.\r\nGrown at Manhattan, Kansas, on upland prairie having a heavy clay\r\nsubsoil]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Showing Advantage of Early Fall Sowing=\r\n\r\nBeginning on the left the seed was sown August 19, September 15 and\r\nOctober 1 respectively. All were dug up April 13 of the following\r\nspring. Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 84]\r\n\r\nOn a farm of Governor Hoard, in Wisconsin, all the brood sows have for\r\nseveral years been wintered on alfalfa hay of the third cutting, and\r\ntheir drink, without any grain until the last two weeks of gestation.\r\nMr. Hoard says the object was to give the sows a food that should keep\r\nthem in a non-feverish state and furnish protein sufficient to build the\r\nbodies of the forthcoming pigs. (Their “drink” was the skim milk from\r\nthe dairy.)\r\n\r\n“It was a matter of experiment at first, our only guide being what\r\nknowledge and reason we could exercise from what we knew, or thought we\r\nknew, of the philosophy of gestation. The experiment proved to be a\r\nsuccess from the first. The sows went through their work in fine\r\ncondition, giving milk abundantly. The pigs came with splendid vitality,\r\nthus reducing our losses from early death fully 30 per cent over what\r\nthey had previously been. The hay is fed dry and is thrown into the pen\r\non the feeding floor without any cutting or chaffing whatever. We have\r\nsometimes thought we would try the experiment of cutting it into\r\nhalf-inch lengths and moistening it. Possibly it would take less hay in\r\nthis way. The sows keep in good flesh, fully as much so as we like.”\r\n\r\nA Finney county, Kansas, farmer reports having pastured 30 pigs on one\r\nacre of alfalfa from May 1st to September 1st, when they weighed 100\r\npounds each and were in fine condition for fattening. Another Kansas\r\nfarmer reports keeping 100 pigs from about the middle of April to\r\nSeptember on five acres of alfalfa pasture. A little grain during the\r\nlast two months would have gained him many pounds of pork. Many alfalfa\r\nraising pig-growers insist that their pigs can be maintained from May\r\nto October on alfalfa for one-half what it would cost for almost any\r\nother feed.\r\n\r\nThe Utah station found that young shoats gained one-third of a pound a\r\nday on alfalfa pasture without grain. But the station found also that\r\nthe gain was not so great in older hogs. A Wisconsin dairyman reported\r\nthat he kept nine sows all winter and spring on alfalfa hay and skim\r\nmilk, without any grain, and raised from them 75 pigs, all healthy and\r\nvigorous.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado station considers that a ration of three-fourths corn and\r\none-fourth alfalfa hay is the best for fattening hogs for market, but\r\nfor young hogs not ready for fattening the proportions should be\r\nreversed. The station does not recommend grinding alfalfa hay for hogs,\r\nprobably on the theory that the hog’s time is not worth much at best.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VALUABLE FEEDING TEST\r\n\r\nThe Kansas station in the fall of 1898 made a series of experiments of\r\ninterest to feeders everywhere. The test was to determine the value of\r\nalfalfa hay fed to fattening hogs that were receiving all the grain they\r\nwould eat. The results are related here in the language of the bulletin:\r\n\r\n“The hogs fed in this experiment were bought of farmers, and averaged in\r\nweight 125 pounds each. They were placed in lots of ten each, in large\r\npens, having for shelter some sheds open to the south. The alfalfa hay\r\nused was of the best quality, carefully cured. Blackhulled White\r\nKafir-corn was the grain used, the hogs being fed all they would eat\r\nwithout waste. The hay was fed dry in forkfuls in a large flat trough.\r\nThe pigs were given more than they could eat, and they picked out the\r\nleaves and finer stems, rejecting the coarser stems. One lot of hogs was\r\nfed Kafir-corn meal dry and alfalfa hay; one lot whole Kafir-corn dry;\r\none lot Kafir-corn meal dry, and one lot Kafir-corn meal wet.\r\n\r\n“The experiment began on November 24 and lasted nine weeks. By that time\r\nthe alfalfa-fed hogs became well fattened, and were marketed. We\r\nestimated that it would require four to five weeks additional feeding,\r\nwith ordinary weather, to get the hogs that were fed grain alone into\r\ngood marketable condition.\r\n\r\n“The gain in nine weeks from the different methods of feeding were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                     Gains per hog\r\n                                       in pounds\r\n  Kafir-corn meal dry and alfalfa hay    90.9\r\n  Kafir-corn whole                       59.4\r\n  Kafir-corn meal fed dry                52.4\r\n  Kafir-corn meal fed wet                63.3\r\n\r\n“The gain from feeding alfalfa hay with Kafir-corn meal fed dry, over\r\nthe meal alone fed dry, is more than 73 per cent.\r\n\r\n“The gains per bushel of feed were as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                   Pounds\r\n  Kafir-corn meal dry and 7.83 pounds alfalfa hay   10.88\r\n  Kafir-corn whole                                   8.56\r\n  Kafir-corn meal fed dry                            7.48\r\n  Kafir-corn meal fed wet                            8.09\r\n\r\n“Ten hogs in nine weeks were fed 656 pounds of alfalfa hay; and as shown\r\nabove, for each 7.83 pounds of alfalfa hay fed with the dry Kafir-corn\r\nmeal, the hogs gained 3.4 pounds over those having dry Kafir-corn meal\r\nalone--a gain of 868 pounds of pork per ton of alfalfa hay. These\r\nresults are not due to the feeding value of the alfalfa alone, but also\r\nto its influence in aiding the hogs to better digest the Kafir-corn. The\r\nalfalfa hay also gave a variety to the ration, making it more appetizing\r\nand inducing the hogs to eat more grain. The ten hogs having grain alone\r\nate 3885 pounds of dry Kafir-corn meal, while the ten hogs having hay\r\nand grain ate 4679 pounds of the Kafir-corn meal and 656 pounds of\r\nalfalfa hay. The hay-fed hogs ate more grain and gained more for each\r\nbushel eaten.\r\n\r\n“In a former experiment pigs were pastured through the summer on alfalfa\r\nwith a light feeding of corn. After deducting the probable gain from the\r\ncorn, the gain per acre from the alfalfa pasture was 776 pounds of pork.\r\n\r\n“These facts indicate that to produce pork most cheaply the Kansas\r\nfarmer must have alfalfa pasture in summer and alfalfa hay in winter.”\r\n\r\nThe Kansas station also found in another test that one acre of alfalfa\r\nproduced pork worth $20.30, while one acre of rape produced pork worth\r\n$10.05.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa station director estimated that one acre of alfalfa pastured\r\nwas worth at least three acres of blue-grass for pigs. It is claimed by\r\nKansas farmers that an average acre of alfalfa will pasture 15 pigs,\r\nwhile some report having pastured 20 or more pigs per acre. Those who\r\nhave used alfalfa as a soiling crop for pigs admit, however, that one\r\nacre so utilized is equal to two if not three used as pasture.\r\n\r\nIt is argued by feeders that as many hogs may profitably be allowed with\r\ncattle that are being fattened on corn and alfalfa as when fed corn\r\nalone, as the feeders believe in cleaning out the feed-racks every few\r\ndays and giving the left-over stems to the hogs. If necessary, a little\r\ncorn is added to the hog ration.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEBRASKA TEST\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska experiment station, from a hog-feeding test made in 1903\r\nreported the following:\r\n\r\n“With the alfalfa hay worth $7 per ton, the leaves, containing 40 per\r\ncent more protein, would be worth approximately $10 per ton. The shorts\r\ncost $12.50 per ton delivered. The dairy department charged 15 cents per\r\nhundred for the skim milk used. Corn was delivered to the barns at 30\r\ncents per bushel. Adding the usual rate of 6 cents per hundred for\r\ngrinding, the corn meal cost $12 per ton. At these prices, each hundred\r\npounds of gain in the several lots cost as follows:\r\n\r\n  Lot 1, corn alone          $4.48\r\n  Lot 2, corn and skim milk   3.97\r\n  Lot 3, corn and shorts      3.53\r\n  Lot 4, corn and alfalfa     3.40\r\n\r\n“This experiment shows that at the market prices quoted and the\r\nproportions used in the experiment, skim milk will make corn bring four\r\ncents more per bushel, wheat shorts eight cents more, and alfalfa leaves\r\nnine cents more. Assuming that only five per cent of the 252,520,173\r\nbushels of corn produced in Nebraska this year is being fed to hogs as a\r\nsingle food, these figures would go to show that $1,000,000 more wealth\r\nwould be added to the state if wheat shorts or alfalfa were substituted\r\nfor one-fifth of the corn fed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCUT ALFALFA EARLY FOR HOGS\r\n\r\nIt is especially important that alfalfa intended to be fed to hogs\r\nshould be cut early. An experiment at the Kansas station showed that a\r\nton of early cut and well-cured alfalfa, fed with grain, produced 868\r\npounds of pork while a ton late cut and poorly cured, fed with grain,\r\nproduced only 333 pounds. For fattening hogs it is well to feed about\r\none ton of well-cured alfalfa hay with each 250 bushels of grain.\r\n\r\nFarmer’s Bulletin No. 215 of the United States Department of Agriculture\r\ndeclares that alfalfa is an ideal pasture plant for hogs. “There is no\r\ndanger from bloat and with a limited number of hogs there is practically\r\nno injury to the alfalfa field. Vigorous alfalfa will support 15 to 25\r\nhead of pigs per acre. It is best to limit the number of pigs to that\r\nwhich will be insufficient to keep down an alfalfa field. Cuttings of\r\nhay may then be made at intervals and the growth thus rejuvenated. On\r\nthe average pigs weighing 30 to 60 pounds in the spring will make a gain\r\nof about 100 pounds each during the season. Although pigs may be grown\r\nand fattened upon alfalfa alone, it is best to combine the alfalfa with\r\nsome kind of a grain ration. Alfalfa by itself is too rich in protein to\r\ngive a balanced ration. Where pigs are pastured upon alfalfa alone they\r\nmay be prepared for the market by feeding for a few weeks upon corn. It\r\nis still better, however, to feed a third to a half of a ration of corn\r\nor other grain during the time of pasturing.”\r\n\r\nThe great mistake made by too many who attempt to pasture swine on\r\nalfalfa is in overstocking. There is a tendency to keep within a small\r\npasture more stock than it can comfortably support, with the result that\r\nthe stand is gnawed, trampled and rooted out, while the animals fail to\r\nprosper as they would under more rational treatment.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive and successful swine raisers in Kansas tells\r\nthe author this: “Twenty-five years of pasturing hogs of all ages on\r\nalfalfa has proven conclusively to me that with a fourth to a half grain\r\nration, while they are on such pasture, will produce in them a greater\r\ngrowth per day than when in dry lots on full feeds of corn. Hogs will\r\nmaintain a reasonable growth, but not fatten much, on alfalfa pasture\r\nalone; I believe it profitable to feed them some grain while running on\r\ngreen alfalfa. If it is desired to full-feed hogs, they will make a\r\nrapid fattening growth by increasing the grain ration while on the\r\npasture, and with the full grain ration the meat will be nearly as firm\r\nas those of the dry lot, where grain alone has been fed. I find no\r\ndistinction on the market between alfalfa-fed swine and those purely\r\ngrain-fed, and they sell price and price alike. The general health of\r\nthe alfalfa-fed hogs is equal to that of those maintained on any other\r\nfeed, and they are prolific.”\r\n\r\nThe Kansas station realized $11.90 per acre from rape pasture and $24.10\r\nper acre from alfalfa pasture in ninety-eight days. These results were\r\nobtained from the following experiments, which were begun July 25 and\r\nconcluded October 31.\r\n\r\nThirty shoats, averaging fifty-two pounds in weight, were divided as\r\nnearly equally as possible into three lots of ten each. Lot I was fed on\r\na grain mixture of shorts one-half, corn meal one-fourth, and Kafir-corn\r\nmeal one-fourth, in a dry lot. The other two lots were fed the same\r\ngrain ration, but one received rape pasture and the other alfalfa\r\npasture in addition. Each lot was given what grain the hogs would eat up\r\nclean, and each had access to water and ashes. The weights of grain\r\nconsumed and gains made are as follows:\r\n\r\n  --------------------+---------+--------+---------------\r\n                      |  Grain  | Total  |Grain consumed\r\n         Feed         | consumed|gain, in| per 100 lbs.\r\n                      |in pounds| pounds |gain, in pounds\r\n  --------------------+---------+--------+---------------\r\n    I. No pasture     |  3,801  |  1,023 |     371\r\n   II. Rape pasture   |  3,244  |  1,076 |     301\r\n  III. Alfalfa pasture|  3,244  |  1,078 |     300\r\n  --------------------+---------+--------+---------------\r\n\r\nThe gains of the three lots are very nearly equal. The dry lot consumed\r\n557 pounds (or seventy pounds for every 100 pounds of gain) more grain\r\nthan the pasture lots. The lot on rape required one acre of pasture,\r\nwhile the alfalfa lot used a trifle less than one-half acre.\r\n\r\nThe lot without pasture required 3.71 pounds of grain to produce one\r\npound of gain. Assigning the same value to the grain fed the hogs on\r\nrape pasture, we have 877 pounds of pork credited to the grain and 199\r\npounds credited to the rape. At six cents per pound, the price at which\r\nhogs were selling at the close of the experiment, this would be a credit\r\nof $11.90 per acre for the rape. In a similar manner, the alfalfa is\r\ncredited with 201 pounds of pork, equal to $12.05, and as there was only\r\na half-acre of alfalfa, this makes a rate of $24.10 per acre.\r\n\r\nThe cost of preparing the seed bed and seeding the rape was $1.80 per\r\nacre. It was seeded in the feed lots, on soil that would otherwise have\r\nremained idle or would have grown up to weeds.\r\n\r\nThe shoats on pasture enjoyed their diet and seemed satisfied. Those in\r\ndry lot seemed to be hankering after something green, and their\r\nappetites seemed unsatisfied without some kind of roughness. They would\r\neven nibble at straw, in a vain attempt to satisfy their craving.\r\n\r\n“The experiment,” says Prof. D. H. Otis, “emphasizes the superior value\r\nof alfalfa pasture. Where alfalfa is not available, or where variety is\r\nwanted, or it is desired to utilize otherwise waste land, Dwarf Essex\r\nrape, seeded at the rate of six to eight pounds per acre, any time from\r\nearly spring to late summer, will furnish an excellent diet that is\r\ngreatly relished by the hogs.”\r\n\r\nJ. E. Woodford, of Coffey county, Kansas, April 1, 1905, placed ten\r\nchoice pure bred Poland-China brood sows from twelve to eighteen months\r\nold that were due to farrow in the latter days of June, on a five-acre\r\nfield of alfalfa. They were given no other feed than the alfalfa\r\npasturage until they had farrowed and their pigs were a week old. After\r\nthat the sows had in addition to the alfalfa some bran slop until about\r\nAugust 20, when new corn was fit for feeding. He says: “The sows from\r\nthe time they were turned on the alfalfa until the last week in June\r\nmade a remarkable growth, besides gaining somewhat in flesh. They did\r\nwell with their pigs, reared an average of seven to each sow, and as\r\nsucklers they were a sight to see. The pigs were the most attractive\r\nbunch ever raised in Coffey county, as admitted by our breeding\r\ncompetitors. We weighed a gilt from this lot when six months and five\r\ndays old, and her weight of two hundred and twenty-five pounds was not\r\nabove the average of the whole lot. In our lifelong experience in\r\nrearing swine we have found nothing of the grass kind for them that in\r\nvalue approaches alfalfa.”\r\n\r\nA plat of thrifty, well-established alfalfa suitably fenced and used for\r\npasturing swine of whatever age can scarcely fall short of being among\r\nthe most profitable parts of any farm upon which swine husbandry is\r\ngiven attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIV._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa for Horses and Mules\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison, a Kansas breeder of Percherons, who ranks among the\r\nforemost anywhere, raises his colts to three years at an average weight\r\nof 1700 pounds and his four-year-olds at 1900 pounds, ready for the sale\r\nyard, on alfalfa, except such limited quantities of grain as will make\r\nit more nearly a properly balanced food, and incidentally expedite\r\ngrowth. His opinion, fortified by sixty years of experience, is that\r\nalfalfa as pasturage and hay constitutes by far the most excellent and\r\neconomical frame- and muscle-forming food available to the live stock\r\nindustry. His colts have alfalfa as their first green food, and, if\r\nfoaled in winter, are taught in a few days to nibble the cut hay. He\r\nalso says colts reared mainly on alfalfa have equal spirit and vigor and\r\nbetter dispositions than those given much grain. His brood mares are\r\nmade to rely on alfalfa as their main ration, and for three months\r\nbefore foaling it is practically, unless in midwinter, their only feed.\r\nAs a result they are always in ideal condition, their colts are\r\ndelivered easily, the mares give an abundance of nourishing milk, free\r\nfrom feverish tendencies, and the colts are robustly rugged from their\r\nbeginning. The cost of rearing colts and horses by this method, he\r\nsays, is less, quality and rapidity of their growth considered, than by\r\nany other of which he has knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe well-known J. E. Wing, of Ohio, says: “There is no one thing so good\r\nfor the work horse as alfalfa. He needs less grain, and has more life\r\nand spirit than when fed upon any other hay, yet even working teams can,\r\non account of its richness, be fed too much. This puts an undue strain\r\nupon their excretory organs to eliminate the unnecessary food substances\r\nfrom the tissues. The overfeeding of alfalfa hay to horses has in some\r\nlocalities caused the use of it to become unpopular, and to raise an\r\noutcry against it. The writer has fed no other hay to his\r\nhorses--working teams, driving horses, mares and foals--for many years,\r\nand has yet to observe the first instance of evil result, save that the\r\ndriving horses when not used regularly become soft and easily sweated.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD FOR WORK HORSES\r\n\r\nUntil recently it was not thought in the eastern states that alfalfa was\r\nan especially good feed for horses. On the somewhat noted Watson ranch\r\nat Kearney, Nebraska, the grain supply became exhausted one summer when\r\nthe prices were high. There was an abundance of alfalfa hay, and\r\nalthough it was in August and the horses were at heavy work, such as\r\nplowing and ditching, the entire force of eighty was kept on alfalfa hay\r\nand but little grain, without any injurious effect. They relished the\r\nhay, did the hard work every day and looked as sleek as if on pasture.\r\nSince that time alfalfa hay has been the principal ration for all of the\r\nfarm’s work horses, colts and driving stock.\r\n\r\nIn western Kansas farm horses have been wintered on a daily feed of 10\r\npounds of alfalfa hay and some corn stover, and thin horses fattened on\r\nalfalfa hay and a little corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRESCEUS EATS ALFALFA\r\n\r\nAgain, the prevalent notion that it is not good for driving horses has\r\nbeen contradicted by hundreds of farmers who use it for such horses, and\r\nby hundreds in western towns who use it for delivery horses, dray\r\nhorses, and light drivers, as well. In parts of California it is the\r\nonly hay fed to horses. “Cresceus, the great race horse, is said to have\r\nbeen raised on it and it is said that he is fed no other hay, even while\r\non the racing circuit.” The same was said of Sysonby, the fleetest\r\nThoroughbred in the races of 1905. Many of the city transfer companies\r\nin Denver, Kansas City and Omaha use alfalfa hay, claiming that it\r\nenables them to reduce their grain ration, while their horses seem\r\nstronger and look better than they did with the former feed of corn and\r\ntimothy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO MUCH HAY FED\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt true that Americans feed their horses too much hay. It is\r\ncommon among horse owners to let horses stand to full mangers when not\r\nat work. In London the cab horses, for example, are given hay for but\r\ntwo hours a day, in the evening. At the end of two hours the mangers are\r\ncleared. Careful testing in decreasing the timothy hay ration one-half\r\nhas not shown that the horses required any more grain than before to\r\nkeep them in equally good condition.\r\n\r\nHorses do not need a heavy ration of alfalfa hay. Fed with grain,\r\nprobably 10 or 15 pounds of it is equal to a manger full of other hay.\r\nAs they become accustomed to the alfalfa it may be increased a little,\r\nand the grain decreased. It is a rich food and should not be used as\r\nfreely as hays with less protein.\r\n\r\nProf. L. A. Merrill of the Utah station made six tests of alfalfa hay in\r\ncomparison with timothy for horses under varying conditions of work, and\r\nfound that it was less difficult to maintain their weight with alfalfa.\r\nThe appearance of the horses in every comparison was in favor of the\r\nalfalfa-fed horse, and no ill results were noted on their health by\r\nlong-continued alfalfa feeding. Fourteen-hundred pound horses at hard\r\nwork could be maintained in condition on 32.6 pounds of alfalfa hay per\r\nday, and at rest 20 pounds was sufficient for the same horses.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of hay fed on most farms could be reduced at least\r\none-half.\r\n\r\nWith all its merits alfalfa hay is by no means a properly balanced\r\nration for all purposes, and those unacquainted with this fact are\r\nliable to feed it, exclusively or otherwise, in such quantities as are\r\nboth extravagant and harmful. D. C. Smead, a veterinarian of note, in\r\nwriting about using the hay in too great quantities, especially in\r\nfeeding horses, says this:\r\n\r\n“There is more danger in deranging the digestion or man or beast by an\r\nexcess of protein than by overfeeding on a carbonaceous food. The\r\nproteins in food are more easily acted upon by the digestive fluids, and\r\nthus more easily digested and carried into the blood, where an excess\r\nmeans work for the kidneys to carry it off. We can founder a horse more\r\neasily on wheat than on corn for this very reason. Alfalfa has a\r\nnutritive ratio of practically 1 to 4. An ordinary 1000-pound horse, if\r\ngiven all it will eat of it, will eat from thirty to forty pounds in\r\ntwenty-four hours. As the alfalfa contains about 11 per cent of easily\r\ndigested proteins, you will readily see that the horse would be taking\r\ninto his system nearly four and one-half pounds of protein.\r\n\r\n“About two and one-half pounds of digestible protein is all that an\r\nordinary horse or cow of a thousand pounds weight, when at work or in\r\nmilk, can utilize. In the alfalfa hay we have nearly twice as much as is\r\nneeded. If it were not for some of it being physicked off, we would soon\r\nhave an animal with overworked kidneys or muscular stiffness of a\r\nrheumatic nature. In case of a mare in foal, when fed on alfalfa and\r\nnothing else, the chances are she would drop her colt prematurely, or if\r\nit went full time, the colt would be a nice, fat, little, plump fellow,\r\nwith little vitality and with a tendency to rickets or bowel disease,\r\nall because the alfalfa was too narrow a ration.\r\n\r\n“Now if we fed this mare alfalfa hay once a day or even twice a day, in\r\nmoderate quantities, say fifteen pounds, and gave her one feed of straw\r\nor timothy hay or corn fodder, which are carbonaceous foods, with a\r\nquart of oats a day to impart a little nerve force, we would have her\r\npractically on right lines. Alfalfa, good as it is, is not an\r\nall-sufficient food for any animal. The danger lies in sections where it\r\nis being thrown to the animals relishing it so well and the owner having\r\nit in such abundance that it will come to be considered all-sufficient,\r\nand then trouble is liable to follow. But fed with judgment it is the\r\nbest of all protein foods, and will enable the farmer to feed wisely and\r\nwell many of the unmarketable rough foods he raises, like straw and corn\r\nstover, the one balancing the other.”\r\n\r\nHere and there are horses with digestive apparatus not suited for the\r\nbest use of alfalfa, but they are rare exceptions rather than the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCES RAPID GROWTH\r\n\r\nOne of the foremost horse breeders in America, who constantly maintains\r\nupwards of one hundred head of various ages, writes the author this:\r\n\r\n“In my experience of twenty-five years in pasturing horses on alfalfa,\r\nresults have convinced me that it produces more bone, muscle and blood\r\nin horses in less time than any other pasturage with which I am\r\nacquainted. But I believe it profitable in raising the best horses to\r\nalso use a moderate grain ration, to stimulate rapid growth and early\r\ndevelopment; my horses, however, have shown no ill effects from\r\npasturing on alfalfa without grain, or other feed, and I have found such\r\npasturing conducive to health and prolificacy, maturing animals equal\r\nfor service to any reared otherwise. I have raised three-year-olds grown\r\non alfalfa and a light grain ration to exceed a ton in weight, carrying\r\nall the good qualities of the breed to which they belonged. Further, I\r\nfind using alfalfa as a horse pasture a much more economical method of\r\nraising horses than any other.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Alfalfa One Year Old Showing Effects of Inoculation=\r\n\r\nPlants on the left inoculated with “nitro-culture,” those on the right\r\nnot inoculated]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =A Good Type of a Four-year-old Alfalfa Plant=\r\n\r\ngrown on Kansas upland.

His stock must be reared on\r\ncultivated crops instead of by grazing on grasses that cost nothing.\r\nPound for pound alfalfa is more fattening for young lambs or old sheep\r\nthan clover. Lambs soiled on alfalfa cut daily make a phenomenal growth\r\nand are as a rule free from disease. They may be carried through the\r\nsummer on a light feeding of green alfalfa and general pasture or farm\r\ngrazing, and fattened in the fall on alfalfa hay and cowpeas or a little\r\ngrain, at a generous profit.\r\n\r\nThousands of sheep and lambs are every year brought from Colorado and\r\nMontana to western Kansas and Nebraska and fattened for market on\r\nalfalfa hay and grain, making for these commodities a convenient market\r\nat good prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO PREVENT BLOATING\r\n\r\nPasturing sheep or lambs on alfalfa is dangerous, although there are\r\nsheep raisers who make it a main reliance. One man reports absolute\r\nfreedom from loss for several years, and his method is to have his sheep\r\npen adjoining the alfalfa field and early in April when the alfalfa is\r\njust beginning to put on its green, he arranges a “creep” for the lambs\r\nto go through into the field, and lets them stay there at pleasure. They\r\nsoon wean themselves; the “creep” is then closed and a safe pen in the\r\nalfalfa field is used for shelter from rains and protection from dogs.\r\nWhen necessary to fasten them in at night to guard against dogs or\r\nwolves, he cuts green alfalfa each evening to give them with a little\r\ngrain in the morning before turning them back to the field. The lambs\r\ngrow rapidly and none ever bloat. Nevertheless, most sheep raisers will\r\ncontinue to reckon alfalfa pasture too expensive when it costs so many\r\nanimals for the privilege of its use. Safety is the exception, and not\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\nOwners of large flocks of sheep claim to be able to market lambs from\r\nalfalfa pasture, or when soiled, at one-half to one-third the cost of\r\nmaintenance with any other crop. Green or cured it seems to hasten\r\ndevelopment and the lambs are in fine condition for fattening in\r\nOctober, or the ewes to put into the breeding pen.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska station in a winter experiment of 98 days with one hundred\r\n50-pound lambs, divided into different lots and variously fed with\r\nprairie hay, alfalfa hay, shelled corn, wheat bran, oats and linseed\r\nmeal figured at the prices then current, reached these results:\r\n\r\n1. The alfalfa-fed lambs consumed 1.34 pounds of alfalfa hay and one\r\npound of grain per day as against .88 pound of prairie hay and .89 pound\r\nof grain consumed by the prairie hay fed lambs.\r\n\r\n2. The alfalfa-fed lambs made fifty-two per cent greater gains than the\r\nlambs fed prairie hay and the same grain ration.\r\n\r\n3. The lambs fed prairie hay with corn and 16 per cent of oil meal made\r\n26 per cent larger gains than the lots fed prairie hay with a grain\r\nration of shelled corn, or shelled corn with 25 per cent of bran or oats\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-fifth annual report of the Ontario agricultural college\r\nare some interesting reports on feeding lambs on various foods. The\r\nfeeding periods were 74 days for the first experiment and 42 for the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nBy these tests alfalfa hay was shown to be slightly better for the lambs\r\nin every way than clover hay under practically equivalent conditions.\r\n\r\nThe first and second cuttings of alfalfa were equal in value; the third\r\ncutting was slightly better than the first.\r\n\r\nW. L. Carlyle, dean of the Colorado agricultural college declares\r\nalfalfa hay is the basis of the feeding industry in northern Colorado.\r\n“Without alfalfa our agriculture would be of very little moment. Alfalfa\r\nforms the basis of all our sugar-beet growing. It not only enriches the\r\nsoil in which it grows, but prepares it for the growing of sugar-beets\r\nin a way that no other crop or system or cultivation can, and while\r\ndoing this preparatory work it yields an enormous tonnage of the most\r\nvaluable feed for fattening sheep and cattle. Usually lambs are given\r\nfree access to the hay and are allowed to eat all of it that they will.”\r\n\r\nLamb feeding in northern Colorado has been carried on quite extensively\r\nfor a number of years, and with such success that “Fort Collins lambs”\r\nare recognized in the eastern markets as superior to anything that is\r\nshipped from any other section of the country. The name “Fort Collins\r\nsheep” has extended to all of northern Colorado, just as the “Greeley\r\npotato” is the term given to all potatoes grown in the northern part of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nIn recent years many thousands of old ewes have been fed at the various\r\nsugar factories upon beet pulp, alfalfa hay and corn. The old ewes\r\nthrive much better upon the beet pulp than the lambs or younger sheep.\r\nIt produces a very desirable sappiness of flesh, and when these sheep\r\nhave been on this feed with alfalfa hay for two or three months and are\r\nthen finished with corn, they bring the highest price on the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVI._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa and Bees\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEE FERTILIZES THE ALFALFA\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered that the honey bee is of even more importance to\r\nthe alfalfa than the alfalfa is to the bee. The wonderful strength and\r\nspeed of the bees take them long distances for their food and they have\r\nrecourse to a great variety of plants. But the peculiar construction of\r\nthe alfalfa blossom renders it unable to fertilize itself and its shape\r\nmakes cross fertilization very difficult. In the marvelous “balance of\r\ngood” in nature, alfalfa, like thousands of other plants, is aided in\r\nits lease on life by the insect world. It is not known just how many\r\ninsects or birds assist this remarkable plant, but the honey bee is the\r\nmost conspicuous, the most industrious, the most eager, and certainly\r\nthe most useful.\r\n\r\nCareful observations have been made of seed pods grown near colonies of\r\nbees, and also of those so far from any bee colonies that it was safely\r\nassumed no bees had visited the fields producing the pods. In every case\r\nit was found that those from nearby fields had from 50 to 75 per cent\r\nmore seeds than the others and that they were larger and more perfectly\r\ndeveloped. In Colorado and western Kansas, where bee culture has been\r\ngreatly developed in recent years, it is found that the alfalfa seed\r\ncrop in fields nearest to bee colonies is much heavier and of better\r\nquality than that of fields but a few miles away.\r\n\r\nAt the Kansas experiment station a small plat of vigorous alfalfa was\r\ncovered just before coming into bloom with mosquito netting supported on\r\nsticks. It was therefore known that no bees nor other insects could come\r\ninto contact with the blossoms. Later a careful examination disclosed\r\nthat the pods which had formed were entirely without seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE FERTILIZING IS ACCOMPLISHED\r\n\r\nAs suggesting something of the relation of bees and like insects to the\r\ncross fertilization of alfalfa blossoms and consequent increased seed\r\nproduction, Prof. S. J. Hunter, entomologist of the University of\r\nKansas, who has spent much time making critical observations of bees in\r\nthe alfalfa fields of the Middle West, writes the following for this\r\nvolume:\r\n\r\n“Every farmer is familiar with the evil effects of continuous inbreeding\r\namong live stock. In plant life this same continuous fertilization of\r\none plant by its own pollen works no less injury to its race of plants.\r\nTo prevent such inbreeding among plants nature has devised several\r\nmeans. One of these is illustrated in the alfalfa blossom. If the reader\r\nwill tear away the purple blossom exposing the true organs of\r\nfertilization, it will be seen that the central round body, the stigma,\r\ndesigned to receive the pollen grains, is higher than the surrounding,\r\nelongated, pollen-bearing anthers. It will become evident, then, that it\r\nwill be possible and most likely for the pollen to drop to the base of\r\nthe flower without coming in contact with the stigma, and the flower\r\nwill thus go unfertilized. This is as nature intended it should be,\r\nnamely, that the plant should go unfertilized if it could be fertilized\r\nonly by the pollen of its own blossom. Provision, however, is made for\r\ncross fertilization, that is, fertilization from the pollen of another\r\nflower.\r\n\r\n“The color of the flower itself, its fragrance, and finally the sip of\r\nnectar secreted at the base of the flower, are all intended to attract\r\nflower-frequenting insects. Chief among these is the honey bee. The\r\nfragrance of the flower draws the insect from afar. The color of the\r\nflower reveals its exact location to the insect and when the tongue of\r\nthe bee is inserted into the flower, in quest of the coveted nectar, the\r\nstamens and pistil spring up, striking the under part of the\r\nhairy-covered head. These hairs are barbed and readily retain the\r\npollen, so that the flower both discharges its own pollen and also takes\r\nfrom the head and breast of the bee pollen previously collected from\r\nother flowers. Obviously, the first flower which the insect visits is\r\nnot cross-fertilized. Practical observations upon the relations existing\r\nbetween the honey bee and the alfalfa plant are of value in illustrating\r\nthe effects of the bees upon alfalfa.\r\n\r\n“A case in point: A hundred well matured pods were collected upon an\r\nalfalfa field less than one-half mile away from a large apiary. A\r\nsimilar number were taken from another field. The two fields were as\r\nnearly identical as possible in the matter of soil, culture, and\r\nconditions governing the vegetable growth of the alfalfa plant. The\r\nsecond field, however, was about twenty-five miles away from a colony of\r\nbees. No bees were observed in the field and since there was no timber,\r\nnor other place of shelter where bees might possibly live, it seemed\r\nreasonably safe to say that there were no wild bees in the vicinity. An\r\nexamination of the seed pods from each of the two localities was made\r\nand the number of seeds counted. In the field near the apiary the\r\naverage number of seeds in a pod was found to be 5.58. The seeds were\r\nplump and the pods were numerous upon a cluster. The pods themselves had\r\nseveral spirals. In the other field, the one remote from a known colony\r\nof bees, the average number of seeds in a pod was 3.35. The seeds in at\r\nleast one-third of the pods were small and shriveled. The pods were few\r\nin the cluster, short, and with but few spirals. The seed crop of the\r\nfirst field could be estimated on this basis at two-thirds greater than\r\nthat of the second field.\r\n\r\n“It is a well-known fact that the seed yield per acre for Red clover is\r\ncomparatively small. Red clover belongs to the same family of plants as\r\nalfalfa and it, too, is dependent upon insects for fertilization of its\r\nflowers. The work, however, is restricted largely to the bumble bee,\r\nsince but few other insects have tongues long enough to reach down to\r\nthe nectar of the clover blossom and consequently do not visit the\r\nclover blossom and bring about proper formation of seed. So in\r\nproportion as the bumble bees thrive, the clover flourishes. Alfalfa,\r\nhowever, is not so limited in its number of insect assistants, since the\r\nflower itself is shorter and the nectar accordingly accessible to a\r\ngreater number of insects.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HONEY PRODUCT\r\n\r\nAlfalfa raisers find it to their advantage to have a few stands of bees.\r\nAs the original cost is slight and the bees provide their own food, go\r\nafter the raw material for the manufacture of honey, demand but slight\r\nattention and make such bountiful returns, bee culture has come to be a\r\nvaluable “side line” for the farm. As blooms are to be found in alfalfa\r\ndistricts every day from early May to late October, the bees have a\r\nconstant opportunity for service.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa honey is white and clear, in an extremely delicate comb, has a\r\ndelicious flavor, and an aroma that is delightful. One authentic report\r\nfrom a western Kansas county is of a single hive that contained nearly\r\ntwo hundred pounds, and of another having ninety-six pounds. The owner\r\nof these had twenty-five acres of alfalfa which in one year yielded him\r\nover one hundred tons of choice hay besides the honey. The next year he\r\nincreased his apiary to fifty stands.\r\n\r\nWhile the average yield per hive elsewhere varies from fifteen to thirty\r\npounds, the average in the alfalfa-growing territory is far higher. Thus\r\nthe financial returns of alfalfa may be greatly increased and in some\r\ninstances doubled by having, say, two colonies of bees for each acre. Or\r\nif only a part of the alfalfa raisers in a neighborhood keep bees, this\r\nratio could be doubled or trebled by those who do. Unlike other\r\ntrespassers on neighbors’ fields the bees do the neighbors a distinct\r\nfavor, by fertilizing their alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVII._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa and Poultry\r\n\r\n\r\nBETTER THAN MEDICINE\r\n\r\nAt first it might seem that too much was claimed for alfalfa if written\r\nof as a specially valuable adjunct in poultry raising. The poultry\r\nindustry of the United States is making wonderful advances, and the\r\nvolume of its returns is enormous; the figures are well-nigh incredible.\r\nOne of the handicaps is disease. Poultry men are a unit in saying that\r\nwhere alfalfa in any form can be supplied to poultry disease is almost\r\nunknown. Fowls like it green, and whether allowed the run of the field\r\nor it is given to them daily they eat it greedily and thrive. Many\r\nfarmers say emphatically that the hens lay more and larger eggs when\r\nallowed alfalfa in any form. Its nitrogen contributes to the albumen of\r\nthe eggs and to the growth of the young chickens.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY INFLUENCE EGG FERTILITY\r\n\r\nScientific tests of feeding alfalfa to poultry have not been made, but,\r\nno doubt, will be in the near future. If it is found that the eggs are\r\nlarger when the hens are given alfalfa, it may also be found that the\r\npercentage of fertility is greater. For years the complaint has been\r\nmade by farmers and poultrymen that there are too many infertile eggs.\r\nThe financial losses are great if a fourth or third of the eggs used\r\nfor incubation prove infertile. It would seem that the same elements\r\nthat contribute to the growth of the hatched chicken should also add to\r\nthe vitality of the embryo, increasing the percentage of fertility and\r\nadding to the vigor of the newly hatched chick.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIDS IN PREPARING FOR MARKET\r\n\r\nThe growth of young chickens is greatly aided by alfalfa. One man\r\nreports an experiment with five hundred capons, hatched early in March,\r\nthat averaged in December nearly eight pounds and sold in the city\r\nmarket at nineteen cents per pound. They were given the run of a patch\r\nof alfalfa for a time and ate little other feed. Later they were put in\r\nthe yards and fed with alfalfa cut into short lengths, with a little\r\ngrain; still later alfalfa meal was added, with a little wheat. Then,\r\nfinally, alfalfa hay was cut and steamed and added to the ration. The\r\ncost of maintenance and fattening must have been small compared with the\r\nlarge returns.\r\n\r\nThis item is from the Harper, Kansas, _Sentinel_: A subscriber tells us\r\nthat the mites and chicken lice were completely driven out of his barn\r\nand hen house, as soon as he had alfalfa hay put in his barn and used it\r\nin the house for nests. He says that before the hay was cut, it was\r\nimpossible to keep a horse in the barn or to have a hen hatch a nest of\r\neggs, but neither mites nor lice can be found now. This is a new use for\r\nalfalfa, but if it does the work, it will be lots cheaper than buying\r\npoisonous decoctions and spraying pumps to get rid of lice and mites,\r\nthe greatest pests to poultry raisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVIII._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa Food Preparation\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growing appreciation of alfalfa as a stock and dairy food and the\r\nexpense of baling and shipping it as hay, the loss of leaves, and the\r\nliability to heat and mold unless well cured, have led to the\r\nmanufacture from it of several food preparations. These in some cases\r\nare made by simply grinding into a meal, and in others by mixing the\r\nmeal with molasses, or a variety of food products, and assumed\r\ncondiments and appetizers.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado station in a feeding test concluded that the ground alfalfa\r\nwas not an economical feed for fattening pigs. With cut alfalfa hay\r\ncosting $8 a ton and ground alfalfa $16 a ton the cost of producing one\r\nhundred pounds of gain with the former was $2.62 and with the alfalfa\r\nmeal $3.12. With corn and cut alfalfa hay fed in equal parts by weight\r\nthe cost of producing one hundred pounds of gain was $2.72. With corn\r\nand alfalfa meal fed in equal parts by weight the cost was $3.96. It is\r\nnot improbable, however, that better results would have been obtained if\r\na less proportion of ground or cut alfalfa had been fed. It is also\r\nprobable that the hog’s grinding machinery is better adapted to his\r\ndigestive apparatus than is any other.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR COTTRELL ON ALFALFA MEAL\r\n\r\nIt is worth while, however, to consider the arguments in favor of\r\ngrinding alfalfa. Prof. H. M. Cottrell says:\r\n\r\n“Grinding alfalfa increases its digestibility. How much has not been\r\ndetermined. Grinding increases the digestibility of corn and oats as\r\nmuch as 14 per cent, and of wheat 10 per cent. It is probable that there\r\nis a greater gain in digestibility from grinding alfalfa, a coarse feed,\r\nthan there is from grinding grain.\r\n\r\n“When alfalfa is to be fed at a distance from the place where grown it\r\nmust be baled for shipping. When the bales are opened and scattered in\r\nfeeding a considerable part of the leaves is wasted. Over 8 per cent of\r\nthe protein in alfalfa is found in the leaves, and the loss of protein\r\nfrom leaves wasted in feeding baled hay is frequently from one-fourth to\r\none-half of the total amount in the original hay. With ground alfalfa\r\nthere is no waste in feeding either from leaf or stem. Alfalfa ground is\r\nin the best condition for shipping and handling cheaply and without\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n“Ground alfalfa is not only a good feed itself but when mixed with grain\r\naids in the digestion of the other feeds, enabling the feeder to get\r\nmore out of his home grown grain.\r\n\r\n“Experiments have not been made to determine the exact value of this\r\ndiluting effect of alfalfa meal in increasing the feed value of heavy\r\ngrains. Tests have shown that corn-and-cob meal has the same feeding\r\nvalue as an equal weight of clear corn meal. Practically worthless\r\nground cobs by their ‘lightening up’ the heavy corn meal add 20 per cent\r\nto the feeding value of the meal with which they are mixed. It is\r\nreasonable to believe that a rich feed like ground alfalfa has even a\r\ngreater influence when mixed with corn meal. The more intimate the\r\nmixture the greater the benefits from alfalfa, and for this reason\r\nground alfalfa is far superior to the whole hay.\r\n\r\n“Grinding alfalfa hay reduces the power needed to digest and assimilate\r\nit. It takes power for an animal to chew the feed, digest it and bring\r\nabout the chemical changes that convert it into flesh or milk. All this\r\nenergy is taken from the actual food material in the alfalfa.\r\nExperiments show that a much larger amount of food value is used up in\r\nthis way with coarse feeds than with concentrated fine feeds. In corn, a\r\nconcentrated feed easily worked up in the animal’s body, three-fourths\r\nof the protein actually in the hay is digested; and in straw, a still\r\ncoarser feed, only one-tenth. Forty-eight per cent of all the energy in\r\ncoarse hay is used up in chewing and digesting it, while only twenty per\r\ncent of the energy in oats is used in these processes. This shows the\r\nvalue of preparing feed in such a way as to require the least effort on\r\nthe part of the animal to use it.\r\n\r\n“In a well constructed mill it requires one horse-power ten hours to\r\ngrind alfalfa sufficient for a month’s ration for a dairy cow in full\r\nmilk. This indicates what a saving the grinding of alfalfa makes in its\r\neffective use by an animal.\r\n\r\n“Experiments show that good alfalfa hay and wheat bran have practically\r\nthe same value in feeding for milk. In a test made of bran and alfalfa\r\nmeal, two lots of cows were selected that were giving equal weights of\r\nmilk. One lot was fed bran, the other lot the same weight of alfalfa\r\nmeal. For each 100 pounds of milk given by the cows fed bran, 141 pounds\r\nwere yielded by the cows fed alfalfa meal.”\r\n\r\nAs an example, “Alfamo” is the name of one of the numerous new feeds on\r\nthe market, having alfalfa meal as its principal ingredient. After a\r\nyear of experimenting with grinding and mixing various feeds it was\r\ndetermined by the manufacturers that a feed made of three parts alfalfa\r\nmeal and one part beet-sugar molasses would possess a very high value.\r\nThe ingredients are mixed by a special apparatus and subjected to a\r\nprocess which retains and preserves the high nutriment of the feed.\r\n\r\nProf. Samuel Avery of the Nebraska station made an analysis of “Alfamo,”\r\nwhich showed the following composition:\r\n\r\n                 Per cent\r\n  Moisture         2.74\r\n  Protein         15.04\r\n  Carbohydrates   50.48\r\n  Ash             13.87\r\n  Crude fiber     17.85\r\n\r\nProfessor Avery also states: “This feed was made by mixing molasses with\r\nalfalfa meal which contained 16.15 per cent protein. It will be noticed\r\nthat the protein content is not greatly reduced, while a large quantity\r\nof nutritious matter has been added in the molasses. An analysis of the\r\nmolasses used in this product, showed practically fifty per cent sugar,\r\nand it should be remembered that the sugar in molasses is all digestible\r\nand ready for the animal without extra effort on the animal’s part,\r\nwhich is not so in corn or other foods, strong in carbohydrates from\r\nwhich the starch must be extracted by the digestive apparatus.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLVING THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM\r\n\r\nSeveral mills for the manufacture of alfalfa foods have been and are\r\nbeing established, and it is reasonable to assume that the use of these\r\nfoods will become quite general in cities and districts remote from the\r\nalfalfa regions. Whether or not the actual feeding value is appreciably\r\nincreased, or the nutritive constituents made more thoroughly available,\r\nis as yet not determined by sufficient tests, nor has it been determined\r\nby any station test that any factory food preparation is more economical\r\nthan alfalfa hay, where the hay can be obtained well cured and with a\r\nreasonable proportion of its leaves. It is altogether probable, however,\r\nthat alfalfa meal will be more economical in distant cities than baled\r\nhay. If these preparations of alfalfa prove to be satisfactory to\r\nconsumers in distant markets, it will lead to the multiplication of\r\nmills in the alfalfa regions, thereby decreasing the cost of\r\ntransportation and giving the grower a wider and probably a better\r\nmarket. The use of the meal or the food preparations is likely to prove\r\nmost especially valuable for dairy cows and poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIX._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa for Town and City\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the preceding chapters have dealt with almost every phase of\r\nalfalfa, it is thought well to emphasize the advantages of its more\r\ngeneral use in cities and towns. In the minds of many there is an\r\nundefined impression that alfalfa is for farm consumption only. Often\r\nwhen first introduced into a community, farmers who raise more than they\r\nhave stock to consume, complain that it is difficult to sell in small\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN COW NEEDS ALFALFA\r\n\r\nMilk producers who know it best concede that alfalfa is an invaluable\r\nfeed in the dairy, closely akin to wheat bran in results and usually\r\nmuch less expensive. In the average small town or city there is about\r\none cow for every ten or fifteen people. Therefore, in a town of one\r\nthousand population, there will probably be seventy-five to one hundred\r\ncows. If alfalfa will increase the quantity of their milk and butterfat,\r\ngiving a product at a lower cost than the concentrated foods, it should\r\nbe more used. But as yet it is not generally used, because it is not\r\nunderstood and appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe best time to secure a supply is when it is being harvested and can\r\nbe taken directly from the field. If the mow is large enough for three\r\nor more tons, a ton can be stored from each of the different cuttings,\r\nand be cured in superior condition almost regardless of the weather. It\r\nwould be found a most economical feed for the family cow and, if fowls\r\nare kept, it could constitute one-third of their ration, adding to\r\ngrowth and to the egg supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHEAP FEED FOR HORSES\r\n\r\nThe larger users of hay in the towns and cities are liverymen,\r\ndeliverymen and teamsters. These have been unacquainted with or doubtful\r\nof the utility of alfalfa and have never given it a fair trial, or\r\npossibly any trial at all. Those who have used it and thought its\r\neffects harmful have perhaps not understood its highly nutritious\r\ncharacter and may have fed it in too large quantities. Having such a\r\nlarge protein content it should not be used with the same prodigality as\r\nprairie hay. For driving horses it should be cut when more matured than\r\nfor other stock, or when about half in bloom, and should be well cured.\r\nFed then, in reasonable rations of from ten to twenty pounds a day,\r\nlivery horses may be kept in vigorous thrift with a small additional\r\nquantity of grain, and thus a saving be made of twenty to thirty per\r\ncent in cost of maintenance. In the alfalfa districts there may be found\r\nmany liverymen who, having had experience with alfalfa hay, feed their\r\nhorses little of anything else. In the last few years there has been a\r\ngrowing demand for alfalfa hay for southern towns and cities.\r\n\r\nThe coat and general appearance of horses fed alfalfa are improved, as\r\ncompared with those fed timothy or prairie hay and the tendency to\r\nconstipation and indigestion is greatly lessened. It is rarely that an\r\nalfalfa-fed animal of any kind is constipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XX._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa in Crop Rotation\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTAINING FERTILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental principle of the best agriculture that every acre\r\nshould be kept constantly at its highest productive capacity. In one\r\nsense the farm is a great machine for the production of food. All\r\nprosperity must originate on and emanate from the farm; the farmer is\r\nreally the only original producer. The measure of the world’s material\r\nsuccess must be the relative amount of the product of the farm. As lands\r\ndecrease in fertility, the cost of living increases in direct\r\nproportion. As fertility decreases, land values decrease and rural\r\npopulation decreases. Already there are districts in America that are\r\nalmost depopulated because of the barrenness of what was, but a short\r\nwhile ago, fertile land.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of maintaining fertility is to restore to the\r\nland annually those chemical elements taken from it by the crops grown.\r\nA prominent importer of horses relates that he was once entertained on a\r\ngreat horse farm in France, whose owner told him that much of the farm\r\nhad been in cultivation for over eight hundred years and was, he\r\nbelieved, as productive now as ever in its history.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa ranks as the greatest fertilizing plant known to scientific\r\nagriculture. All cereal crops use large quantities of nitrogen. A field\r\ncropped for years in corn or wheat will come to have too little nitrogen\r\nfor the production of a profitable crop. Alfalfa, as has already been\r\nstated, after the first few months of its life obtains its whole supply\r\nof nitrogen from the air; in fact, more than it really needs. As a soil\r\nimprover it possesses at least five valuable properties:\r\n\r\n1. It gathers nitrogen from the air for its own maintenance and a\r\nsurplus that is constantly being added to the soil.\r\n\r\n2. It is a deep feeder and its roots penetrate the earth to\r\nextraordinary depths, drawing toward the surface and utilizing moisture\r\nand valuable mineral elements that other crops would never reach,\r\nleaving the desirable elements there for future crops, of whatever\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n3. By capillarity, these roots and rootlets draw up moisture from below\r\nthe surface until it modifies the very top soil, changing wonderfully\r\nthe nature of the field. The analysis of a cubic foot of earth of a\r\nflourishing alfalfa field shows a marvelous change in moisture content\r\nsince the sowing.\r\n\r\n4. The mere mechanical effect of the extensive root system can scarcely\r\nbe over-estimated. As soon as germination begins the plant starts its\r\ntiny roots downward on the search for moisture. Roots four feet long\r\nhave been found on alfalfa but four months old; roots nine feet long\r\nhave been found below alfalfa but nine months old. After the taproot\r\nreaches a few inches below the surface, it sends out smaller roots that\r\nhave a lateral growth of but a few inches, when they too, take a\r\ndownward course for moisture and for mineral elements needed for the\r\ngrowth above. These first smaller roots decay and others start out from\r\nthe taproot lower down. These decay and still others start. The decaying\r\nroots add humus to the soil, and the openings left by them form a\r\nwonderful system of channels for the penetration of air and water into\r\nthe soil. The erstwhile compact earth is honeycombed and air and water\r\npenetrate the graves of the dead roots until, when the alfalfa field is\r\nready to be used for a different crop, the soil has been wonderfully\r\nchanged not only in its chemical elements but in its physical character.\r\n\r\n5. The regular deposit of alfalfa leaves, from the cuttings, under the\r\nbest care, has been estimated at one-half ton or more per acre every\r\nyear. As these leaves contain a great percentage of protein, it can\r\nreadily be seen that they make a heavy contribution to the soil’s\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF STUBBLE AND ROOTS\r\n\r\nWhen in his system of rotation the farmer is ready to plow up his\r\nalfalfa, he has another inestimable contribution to the land’s fertility\r\nin the stubble and roots. It is not recommended to plow under any\r\nconsiderable growth as a green manure, as the hay crop is too valuable.\r\nIts market value would buy more fertilizers than the same growth is\r\nworth for humus. After a field has stood for five or six years, the\r\nroots have added largely to the humus content. Prof. W. P. Headden of\r\nColorado, estimated that the fertilizing value of the stubble and 6¹⁄₂\r\ninches of roots plowed under is about $20 per acre, while the value of\r\nthe stubble and entire root system is not less than $35 per acre.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey station estimated that the amounts of plant food gathered\r\nby an acre of alfalfa in two years were equivalent in nitrogen to that\r\ncontained in 3500 pounds of nitrate of soda; in phosphoric acid to that\r\ncontained in 600 pounds of boneblack superphosphate, and in potash to\r\nthe amount contained in 1200 pounds of muriate of potash, or equal to\r\nwhat would have cost $124.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS ON SUCCEEDING CROPS\r\n\r\nThe Wyoming station, at Laramie, under direction of Prof. B. C. Buffum\r\n(Bul. No. 44) made some tests that proved the market fertilizing value\r\nof alfalfa. A plot of ground that had been in alfalfa for five years\r\nadjoined a plot of the same size that had been in varied crops, wheat,\r\noats, potatoes, etc. After the alfalfa sod was broken the two plots were\r\nprepared together and planted crosswise to wheat, oats and potatoes,\r\nwith half of each on the broken sod and half on the other plot with the\r\nfollowing yields and gains:\r\n\r\n                       After\r\n             After     Other    Money\r\n             Alfalfa   Crops    Gain\r\n  Wheat      30 bu.   18 bu.  $8 to $12\r\n  Oats       78 bu.   37 bu.         16\r\n  Potatoes   81 bu.   52 bu.         16\r\n\r\nStating the results in another way, Prof. Buffum says: “The value of\r\nalfalfa harvested from one-half acre of land for five years was about\r\n$50 more than the cost of producing it.\r\n\r\n“The value of potatoes and grain from an adjoining half-acre for five\r\nyears was about $44 more than the cost of producing, at local prices.\r\n\r\n“When the alfalfa half-acre was plowed and planted to wheat it produced\r\n$8 to $12 more value in wheat per acre than the land which had grown\r\npotatoes and grain before.\r\n\r\n“When the alfalfa half-acre was plowed and planted to oats it produced\r\n$16 worth of grain more than land which had grown potatoes and grain\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“When the alfalfa half-acre was plowed and planted to potatoes it gave\r\n$16 worth more of potatoes per acre than was obtained from land which\r\nhad grown potatoes and grain before.\r\n\r\n“By growing alfalfa the increase of yields and values were produced with\r\nabsolutely no cost for fertilizing the land.”\r\n\r\nThis gain, it will be noted, cost nothing in the way of fertilization,\r\nas the alfalfa had every year been more profitable than the other crops.\r\nA Marion county, Kansas, manager of large estates reports that a field\r\nof wheat after alfalfa averaged forty bushels per acre while an\r\nadjoining field of equal original fertility averaged but fifteen\r\nbushels. These results have been duplicated in innumerable instances\r\nwhere alfalfa fields have been plowed and planted to other crops. A\r\nColorado man who farms 1000 acres, with 200 acres of it in alfalfa, says\r\nhe cannot afford not to plow his alfalfa after he has had from it four\r\nyears’ crops; that it is necessary to maintain the general farm\r\nfertility and obtain big crops of corn, oats and potatoes. In the potato\r\ndistricts of Colorado alfalfa is used systematically as a rotation to\r\nmaintain the yields and quality of their potatoes, both of which are so\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nIn the corn belt, which may be said to extend from the central meridian\r\nof Kansas to Pennsylvania, alfalfa used in rotation will do much to\r\nprevent the disgrace of raising an average of but twenty or twenty-five\r\nbushels of corn to the acre. And so in what were once famous wheat\r\nbelts, alfalfa will restore the crop records, if properly used in a\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\n\r\nROTATION A NECESSITY\r\n\r\nSome experiment station men insist that where alfalfa is allowed to\r\nstand for many years it will cease to have a fertilizing value; that\r\nalfalfa draws heavily on the potash and phosphoric acid in the soil, and\r\nwill after, say, eight or ten years begin to deplete it of these\r\nimportant elements. Therefore they insist that alfalfa should not be\r\nallowed to stand for over six or eight years unless it is given an\r\nannual top-dressing of manure. They favor plowing up the alfalfa after\r\nabout five years and cropping to corn or cotton.\r\n\r\nFormer Governor Hoard in speaking of the value of alfalfa as compared\r\nwith that of clover in a crop rotation says that, “alfalfa having a much\r\nlarger root development goes deeper down, thoroughly subsoils the\r\nground, brings up phosphorus and potash from the lower strata, and\r\nleaves much more vegetable matter to decay and furnish humus. Nothing\r\nelse we have ever tried equals alfalfa for putting the soil in good\r\ntilth.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSPREADS THE BACTERIA OVER THE FARM\r\n\r\nMen who are raising alfalfa for use in a regular rotation never leave it\r\nover six years; many prefer five, while others make it a rule to plow\r\nup their fields every four years; thus the bacteria becomes fixed in the\r\nsoil of the whole farm. Such farmers use alfalfa as they formerly used\r\nclover, to restore fertility needed for profitable crops of grain, hay\r\nand forage.\r\n\r\nThe sod is hard to plow. It is well to do the breaking immediately after\r\nthe season’s cutting, if possible; disk and harrow it several times and\r\nsow to rye for winter pasture, and plant to corn or cotton or potatoes\r\nin the spring. The winter’s freezing will help to put it in fine tilth.\r\nIf it is desired to follow with wheat (not always advisable, however, on\r\naccount of causing a too rank growth), the sod may be plowed after the\r\nyear’s second mowing, disked and sowed to rye to prevent the soil from\r\nleaching.\r\n\r\nBreaking up a well set alfalfa field is no trifling matter. It may be\r\ndone with three heavy horses, but it is hard work for them, and they\r\nwill not be able to break more than one acre a day. An authority says\r\nthe best plan is to use five heavy horses--three in the lead and two on\r\nthe end of the beam. They can go right along and plow two acres a day.\r\nAlfalfa roots are very tough and strong when the plants have attained\r\nfull growth, and they give a jerky motion to the plow, which is severe\r\non horses’ shoulders. A cast steel plow is the best to use and if it is\r\ntempered right a file can just cut it. It can be hammered out thin at\r\nthe blacksmith’s shop when it becomes too thick to file easily. “The\r\nreason for filing, rather than using the hard, thin edge as in other\r\nplowing is that the edge needs to be rough as well as thin, or the roots\r\nwill slip along the sloping edge of the share and not be cut.” It is\r\nimportant that the furrow turned shall not be wider than the plowshare\r\nwill all the time cut clean, as any main roots that are left uncut will\r\nsend up a more vigorous growth of stems than before, which, in another\r\ncultivated crop will be the same as weeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alfalfa Plant and Roots Showing Bacteria Nodules]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Tubercles on Clover Roots=\r\n\r\nIn untreated soil\r\n\r\nIn inoculated soil]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXI._\r\n\r\nNitro-Culture\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD-NEW THEORY\r\n\r\nThe inoculation of soil, like many other lately exploited theories, has\r\nno doubt been known for hundreds of years. There are evidences that it\r\nwas practiced in England at least a century ago, and it is thought to be\r\nan old custom among the Chinese. Some space was given to “soil\r\ninoculation” in a preceding chapter, attention there being devoted to\r\nthe simple methods of infecting soil with bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nSome twenty years ago a German scientist, Nobbe, discovered that the\r\nsmall nodules found on the roots of the leguminous plants contained\r\nbacteria that took nitrogen from the air and transferred it to the\r\nplant. It had been known that cultivated soils were rapidly losing their\r\noriginal supply of nitrogen and there seemed no practicable way of\r\nrestoring it in sufficient quantity. Commercial nitrogen costs fifteen\r\ncents per pound and the expense of applying it to the land to equalize\r\nthe loss from an ordinary farm crop is almost equal to the value of a\r\ncrop. Hence, the discovery that the legumes were nitrogen-gathering, by\r\nmeans of these bacteria, was hailed as one of the greatest of the age.\r\nWith millions of pounds of nitrogen over his land there seemed now a\r\nmethod whereby the farmer could utilize some needed portions of it. The\r\nbacteria live in tubercles upon the roots of various leguminous plants,\r\nsuch as Red clover, Sweet clover, Bur clover, alfalfa, cowpeas, garden\r\npeas, vetches and beans. These tubercles are the home of the bacteria,\r\nminute forms of vegetable life, too small to be seen with the naked eye.\r\nThe legumes have no power in themselves to draw nitrogen from the air,\r\nyet these bacteria seem to have the power to absorb the free nitrogen\r\nand cause it to combine with other elements, forming nitrates or other\r\nassimilable compounds suitable for plant food. It has also been\r\ndemonstrated that, as a rule, there are different species of these\r\nbacteria for different species of legumes.\r\n\r\nAfter German scientists had made their discoveries, one of the existence\r\nof these bacteria on the roots of the legumes and another that in the\r\nlaboratory, these organisms could be bred and multiplied, they seemed\r\nunable to develop them of sufficient vigor to survive any general\r\ndistribution. At this point Dr. George T. Moore of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, hit upon a plan of cultivating them in a way\r\nby which they could be preserved for many months, and he also gave them\r\na much greater power. This nitrogen-fixing power was so developed that\r\nseeds soaked in the solution, it is claimed, sprouted and produced\r\nplants in sand that possessed no nitrates. He then found that these\r\nbacteria when grown upon nitrogen-free media will retain a high activity\r\nfor a long time, if carefully dried out and then revived in a liquid\r\nmedium. He also devised a plan by which they could be mailed to any part\r\nof the world and arrive in perfect condition.\r\n\r\nMost experiment station men have given to Dr. Moore great credit for his\r\ndiscoveries and have tried, with rather marked success, his method of\r\nnitro-culture; on the other hand a few have been opposed to the method\r\nfrom the beginning and are still opposed. It would seem that the tests\r\nmade prove that nitro-culture does introduce bacteria when directions\r\nare followed.\r\n\r\nOf course if a farmer’s soil has the alfalfa bacteria, it is not\r\nnecessary to use any system of inoculation. If Sweet clover or Bur\r\nclover is growing in the vicinity, or if alfalfa is thriftily growing\r\nnear without the aid of inoculation, it is hardly necessary to make\r\nthere further efforts for the introduction of bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nIn a preceding chapter the opinion was expressed that in most states,\r\nand in most localities in those states, inoculation was unnecessary\r\nbecause bacteria were already present; yet it is true that these\r\nbacteria are present, if at all, in varying quantity. If comparatively\r\nfew are present, any method of inoculation that will introduce more into\r\nthe soil, to hasten the growth of the tubercles and promote the\r\ngathering of nitrogen, will be helpful. The fact is, we know as yet\r\ncomparatively little of all there is to be learned about this wonderful\r\nprinciple. It is altogether probable that the use of nitro-culture is as\r\npracticable and as free from objections as the use of inoculated soil,\r\nespecially from distant and unknown fields. In one of its bulletins the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture has summarized its advice as to\r\ninoculation as follows:\r\n\r\n_When Inoculation is Necessary._--Inoculation is necessary--\r\n\r\n1. On a soil low in organic matter that has not previously borne\r\nleguminous crops.\r\n\r\n2. If the legumes previously grown on the same land were devoid of\r\nnodules, of “nitrogen knots,” thus showing the need of the\r\nnodule-forming bacteria.\r\n\r\n3. When the legume to be sown belongs to a species not closely related\r\nto one previously grown on the same soil. For instance, soil in which\r\nRed clover forms nodules will often fail to produce nodules on alfalfa\r\nwhen sown with the latter crop for the first time.\r\n\r\n_When Inoculation May Prove Advantageous._--Inoculation may prove\r\nadvantageous--\r\n\r\n1. When the soil produces a sickly growth of legumes, even though their\r\nroots show some nodules.\r\n\r\nIf the cultures introduced are of the highest virility, their use will\r\noften result in a more vigorous growth.\r\n\r\n2. When a leguminous crop already sown has made a stand, but shows signs\r\nof failing, owing to the absence of root nodules.\r\n\r\nThe use of the culture liquid as a spray or by mixture with soil and\r\ntop-dressing may save the stand if other conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\n_When Inoculation is Unnecessary._--On the other hand, inoculation is\r\nunnecessary and offers little prospect of gain--\r\n\r\n1. When the leguminous crops that are usually grown are producing up to\r\nthe average, and the roots show nodules in normal abundance.\r\n\r\nCultures of nitrogen-fixing bacteria are not to be regarded in the light\r\nof fertilizers, or as capable of increasing the yield under average\r\nconditions. They do not contain nitrogen itself, but bacteria, which\r\nmake it possible for the legumes to secure nitrogen from the air\r\n(through the formation of root nodules). Where the soil is already\r\nadequately supplied with these bacteria, it will not usually pay to\r\npractice artificial inoculation.\r\n\r\n2. When the soil is already rich in nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIt is neither necessary nor profitable to inoculate a soil rich in\r\nnitrogen when sowing legumes. Not only does the available nitrogen in\r\nthe soil render the formation of nodules less necessary, but the\r\nnitrogenous materials in the soil largely prevent the bacteria from\r\nforming nodules.\r\n\r\nAny increased virility in nitrogen-fixing power possessed by any of the\r\ntypes of bacteria yet distributed, may be rapidly lost in a soil\r\ncontaining an abundance of nitrogen, because the bacteria are in a\r\nmedium in which there is no demand for activity in securing atmospheric\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n_When Failure is to be Expected._--Inoculation will fail where other\r\nconditions (aside from the need of bacteria) are not taken into account,\r\namong which are the following--\r\n\r\n1. In soil that is acid and in need of lime.\r\n\r\nLiming to correct acidity is as important for the proper acidity of the\r\nbacteria as for the growth of the plants.\r\n\r\n2. In soil that is deficient in fertilizers, such as potash, phosphoric\r\nacid or lime.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the bacteria in securing nitrogen from the air and\r\nrendering it available to the legumes does not do away with the need for\r\nsuch fertilizing elements as potash and phosphorus.\r\n\r\n3. It must also be remembered that inoculation does not “act like\r\nmagic”; it will not overcome results due to bad seed, improper\r\npreparation and cultivation of the ground, and decidedly adverse\r\nconditions of weather and climate.\r\n\r\nIn the use of the cultures, also, failure is almost certain where the\r\ndirections are not carefully studied and intelligently followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CLOVER SOIL USED TO INOCULATE ALFALFA FIELDS\r\n\r\nThe discovery in Illinois that inoculation of the soil for alfalfa was\r\nnecessary in certain places and not in others suggested the theory that\r\nbacteria living on some other, probably native, plant were identical\r\nwith the alfalfa bacteria. Investigations led to satisfactory evidence\r\nthat this was the case and that the native plant was the ordinary Sweet\r\nclover (_Melilotus alba_). The illustration facing page 230 shows the\r\nresults of a series of pot culture experiments made at the University of\r\nIllinois and reported in Bulletin No. 94 by Prof. Cyril G. Hopkins. The\r\nfour photographs were made five, six, seven and eight weeks,\r\nrespectively, from the time of planting. Alfalfa seed were planted in\r\neach of the five pots, in carefully prepared soil practically free of\r\ncombined nitrogen, and at the same time four of the five pots were\r\ninoculated as follows:\r\n\r\nPot No. 1.--Not inoculated.\r\n\r\nPot No. 2.--Inoculated with bacteria obtained from infected alfalfa\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nPot No. 3.--Inoculated with bacteria obtained from alfalfa root\r\ntubercles.\r\n\r\nPot No. 4.--Inoculated with bacteria obtained from infected Sweet clover\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nPot No. 5.--Inoculated with bacteria obtained from Sweet clover root\r\ntubercles.\r\n\r\nThe results indicate that the same effect is produced upon the growth of\r\nthe alfalfa by the nitrogen-gathering bacteria obtained from Sweet\r\nclover as by those from the older alfalfa, and seem to prove that\r\ninfected Sweet clover soil can be used for the inoculation of alfalfa\r\nfields. Investigations have shown that 100 pounds of thoroughly infected\r\nsoil to the acre is sufficient to produce a satisfactory inoculation\r\nwithin one year from the time it is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXII._\r\n\r\nAlfalfa as a Commercial Factor\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT ON LAND VALUES\r\n\r\nOnly a few years ago alfalfa hay was not named in the market reports.\r\nNow it is conspicuous in the lists of hays. Then there were thousands of\r\nsandy acres in Kansas and Nebraska being held at from $2 to $5 per acre\r\nthat now, seeded to alfalfa, are selling at from $30 to $75 per acre.\r\nThen, cultivated farms in those districts could be rented for $1 per\r\nacre; now, seeded one-half to alfalfa, they rent for $3 to $5 and more\r\nper acre. In the South cotton lands rent for $5, and alfalfa lands at\r\n$15 per acre. Land in the Yellowstone valley was worth, wild, $1.50 per\r\nacre; now, under irrigation and seeded half to alfalfa and half to wheat\r\nit commands $100 per acre. A few years ago labor commanded in those\r\ndistricts that now raise alfalfa about $1 a day; since then, during\r\nalfalfa harvest, hundreds of men have been imported there and paid $2 or\r\n$2.50 per day. Then farmers were poor and trade was dull; now, a farmer\r\nwho owns eighty acres well set in alfalfa, harvests about 300 tons of\r\nhay worth from $5 to $12 per ton and has the proceeds available for\r\nadded comforts, improvements and luxuries.\r\n\r\nA few years ago it was thought that America was approaching a crisis in\r\nthe matter of beef and pork and mutton production because of the rapid\r\ndiminishing of the free public ranges by the forest reserves, irrigation\r\nprojects, and the like. It was insisted that the farmers could not\r\nnearly sustain the meat supply. Possibly they cannot, but alfalfa is\r\ndoing wonders in helping to solve the problem of cheap meat production.\r\nMillions of sheep and thousands of cattle are being fattened annually on\r\nthe alfalfa of California, Montana, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska, and\r\nin some portions where a few years ago the sandy prairies gave but a\r\nscant subsistence to scrawny range cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nENHANCES DAIRY INTERESTS\r\n\r\nIn parts of the East since the introduction of alfalfa, the number of\r\ndairy cows in many townships has trebled and the dairy product more than\r\nquadrupled. When two acres of alfalfa will carry ten dairy cows through\r\na summer, the day and opportunity of the small dairyman are certainly at\r\nhand. When, as is the case, alfalfa increases the rental and selling\r\nvalue and consequently the taxable value of land; when it increases the\r\ndemand for and price of labor; when it increases the fertility of the\r\nland for other crops that may follow; when it brings enlarged profits to\r\nthe entire stock-raising and stock-fattening interests, and puts more\r\nmoney in circulation, it is inevitably to be considered a commercial\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXIII._\r\n\r\nThe Enemies of Alfalfa\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most notable enemies of alfalfa are weeds, insects, parasites, and\r\nanimals. More failures to raise alfalfa are caused by weeds than by all\r\nother enemies combined. The cause of weeds in a field is usually poor\r\nfarming. Clipping alfalfa early in May will kill many weeds. If the\r\nweeds grow up, clip again and do the same every time they threaten to\r\nbecome rampant. If they are kept from seeding, and do not in a large\r\nmeasure crowd out the alfalfa, good crops may be had from it the second\r\nseason. If sowed in the fall, disking early in April may kill most of\r\nthe weeds. It is folly to sow alfalfa on a foul field, as it is far less\r\nexpensive to kill out the weeds beforehand. Disking and clipping will do\r\nmuch to destroy them, but if they secure a strong foothold the best\r\nthing to do is to plow up the field, plant it in corn, give it clean\r\ncultivation, and sow alfalfa again when the weeds have been\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDODDER\r\n\r\nDodder is an annoying enemy. It is a parasite, belonging to the\r\nmorning-glory family, growing from its own small seed but attaching\r\nitself very soon to the alfalfa stalk. It then separates itself from its\r\nown root and thereafter lives on the juices of the alfalfa until it\r\nripens its seeds or has killed the alfalfa. The wisest and safest thing\r\nto do is to sow only seed so thoroughly cleaned that there will be no\r\ndodder with it. If, later, it is found that any dodder seed escaped the\r\ncleaning operations and is growing, the grower should go through the\r\nfield with a knife or sickle and a large basket or sack and cut out and\r\nburn every dodder vine and every plant to which dodder is attached. If\r\nso unfortunate as to have sown seed with a considerable mixture of\r\ndodder, clip the alfalfa early in May, let the clippings dry for two or\r\nthree days or longer, and then burn on the field, watching carefully to\r\nhave the fire touch every part. It will facilitate a complete burning to\r\nsprinkle parts not burning readily, with kerosene. If there is a poor\r\nstand of alfalfa, largely infested with dodder, safety lies in plowing\r\nit up and cultivating the field in corn or potatoes for two or three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Peculiar Nodules in Groups on Small Rootlets=\r\n\r\nand distant from the large alfalfa roots. From Michigan Experiment\r\nStation Bulletin No. 225]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Alfalfa Roots Showing Normal Nodules=\r\n\r\nsmall and near the large roots. From Michigan Experiment Station\r\nBulletin No. 225]\r\n\r\nFrom an excellent article on the dodder that infests alfalfa (_Cuscuta\r\nepithymum_) by Mr. F. E. Dawley, a New York authority on alfalfa, and\r\nprinted with illustrations in the _Country Gentleman_, the excerpts here\r\nfollowing are taken:\r\n\r\n“The only sure method of keeping alfalfa fields free from dodder is\r\nthrough exercising greater caution in the purchase of seed. There is no\r\nreason why thoroughly recleaned alfalfa seed should have any dodder seed\r\nin it, as reference to the illustrations will show. The relative sizes\r\nand forms of the seeds of alfalfa and dodder are shown herewith. It will\r\nbe seen that there is a marked difference in both the sizes and the\r\nshapes of the seeds. The alfalfa seed is shaped like a little kidney\r\nbean, and varies in color from light yellowish-green to a rich\r\ngolden-yellow, and in some instances, because of weathering, or sweating\r\nin the cock, or perhaps standing too long, it shows a reddish-brown\r\ncolor. The dodder seed is darker in color than the alfalfa, all of that\r\nwhich I have succeeded in gathering from the plants being a rich\r\ngolden-brown. The accompanying illustrations show the form of the dodder\r\nand alfalfa seed respectively.\r\n\r\n“The seeds, being sown, germinate in the soil, throwing up a slender,\r\nthread-like stem somewhat resembling a corn silk, which retains its\r\nconnection with the ground until it comes in contact with the stem of\r\nthe alfalfa plant. It twines around this tightly, sending its feeding\r\nsuckers through the outside bark, and as soon as it is firmly attached\r\nto the host plant, the ground connection is severed and it is sustained\r\nby the plant juices which are taken in by the suckers. It continues to\r\ngrow and spread, twining around other stalks and increasing very rapidly\r\nuntil a colony is established. Continuing to grow, it climbs toward the\r\nupper portion of the plants, feeding on their juices and sapping their\r\nvitality, but never goes to the extreme top, seeming to prefer the\r\ndampness and darkness of the matted alfalfa rather than sunlight. The\r\nplants first attacked begin to die, and the dodder, spreading out in all\r\ndirections, forms a circle or ring.\r\n\r\n“The rapidity with which the pest spreads makes it a serious menace to\r\nthe alfalfa grower. Comparatively little work has been done by\r\nscientific men in studying the dodders and methods of eradication, and\r\nthe fact that the little rootlets or suckers (haustoria) become so\r\nfirmly affixed to the host plant that it must be destroyed together\r\nwith the parasite, has made the work hard and the results obtained\r\nunsatisfactory. There are a number of methods by which dodder may be\r\nspread through a field. As soon as it becomes thoroughly established on\r\na host plant, the many little branches, waving about like the shoot\r\nproduced from the seed, attach themselves to other plants, and thus the\r\ncolony is increased in size. In legumes, the host plant first attacked\r\nsoon dies, but before this occurs, the parasite has become firmly\r\nestablished on adjoining plants and is reaching out and completing the\r\ncolony. As soon as a host dies, the dodder also perishes, but before\r\nthis happens it is very likely to have blossomed and seeded.\r\n\r\n“In the operations of mowing, tedding, raking and drawing the alfalfa\r\nhay, these little colonies are spread about the fields by the machines\r\nand the workmen, and on the horses’ feet. The sale of infested hay is a\r\nprolific means of dissemination. Hunters and pleasure seekers, walking\r\nthrough the fields, notice the peculiar corn-silk-like growths and\r\noften, by picking up particles of it which are soon cast away, establish\r\nnew colonies. The flower is very peculiar and attracts the attention of\r\npeople passing, who are apt to pick them together with some of the\r\nmaturing seed, and scatter these over the fields. In a pastured field,\r\nthe animals spread the seed to some extent while moving from place to\r\nplace in feeding. The most serious menace, however, is from the purchase\r\nof impure seed; farmers should always be absolutely certain that the\r\nalfalfa seed which they are buying is thoroughly recleaned and that no\r\nsmall weed seed is to be found in it. One should never sow clover or\r\nalfalfa from a field or even from a locality in which dodder is known to\r\nexist. It is probable that the seeds thoroughly ripened will retain\r\ntheir germinating powers for some years. The purchase of hay from dodder\r\ninfested fields, or the purchase of manure from barns where infested hay\r\nhas been fed, are sure sources of contamination.\r\n\r\n“Where a newly seeded alfalfa field shows evidence of quite general\r\ndodder infection, it is useless to attempt to eradicate it, and the\r\nfield should be plowed up and planted with some hoed crop for a period\r\nof years. Old fields that have been thoroughly infested will probably be\r\nmore economically treated in this manner than in any other. In newly\r\nsown fields, one of the most effective methods is probably hoeing over\r\nthe spots where the dodder appears, going over them once in two weeks\r\nand allowing nothing to grow on them until the dodder seed is\r\ngerminated. A modification of this method has been used successfully by\r\nspading in fields where the colonies of dodder were seen, raking out all\r\nthe tops, roots and branches, adding a little straw or hay and burning\r\nthe mass, and then keeping the spot thoroughly hoed for a season. For\r\nfields where the colonies are small and scattered, this method of hoeing\r\nand shallow cultivation is probably the most practicable, as it helps to\r\nsecure the early germination of any seeds that were left in the ground,\r\nand also kills them as soon as they are germinated. If the seed has\r\ndeveloped, one must be careful not to spade it in too deep, as it may\r\nretain its vitality for some years if left covered in the moist soil.\r\n\r\n“Burning has been recommended by some, raking the dodder vines and what\r\nis left of the alfalfa to the center of the colonies, putting brush or\r\nstraw with it, together with some fine, light wood or chips and\r\nsprinkling with kerosene, so that the alfalfa plants will be burned\r\nclose to the ground. This is necessary from the fact that the little\r\ncoils of dodder close to the crown of the plants will retain their\r\nvitality and grow after a very severe burning, providing the alfalfa\r\nwhich is above the ground is not killed also. The most difficult problem\r\nto be confronted in killing out dodder where it has become established,\r\narises from the fact that if these little coils which wind themselves\r\nclosely around the plant are not killed or removed, the dodder will\r\nspread from these and make a new growth. Many experiments have been made\r\nwith chemicals, but none of them have proved wholly successful, from the\r\nfact that these little rings were not destroyed. All the rest of the\r\nplant was killed and the production of flowers and seed prevented; but\r\nas these little rings were not killed, the dodder began growing again\r\nand continued to grow throughout the season.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAF SPOT\r\n\r\nLeaf spot is a very peculiar disease and, fortunately, not common in\r\nthis country. It has been known in France since 1832. In 1891 it was\r\ndestructive in Iowa alfalfa, the loss in the neighborhood of the\r\nexperiment station being estimated at 50 per cent. In reference to this\r\ninfliction the Iowa station, among other information, printed the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n“Any time after the plant has attained a growth of four to six inches\r\nfrom the seed, but most commonly after the first year’s growth, there\r\nappears upon the upper side of the leaves small, irregular brownish\r\nspots, which enlarge to about one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter and\r\nextend through the leaf to the under side, turning all parts brown. When\r\nmany spots occur on the same leaf the whole leaf soon turns yellow and\r\nfalls off. This falling of the leaves and the natural loss in vigor, due\r\nto the diseased condition before the falling, constitute its great\r\ndamage. Frequent cutting of the crop materially prevents the disease.”\r\n\r\nIn eastern states farmers report that there are frequent patches in\r\ntheir fields where the leaves turn red and the plant dies. The probable\r\nexplanation of this trouble is “wet feet,” which alfalfa will not abide.\r\nDon’t expect to get a crop of alfalfa from a field in which water is\r\nnear the surface. Drain it or use another field.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT ROT\r\n\r\nA disease peculiar to portions of the southern states is called “root\r\nrot,” and similar to the root rot found in cotton fields. The alfalfa\r\ndies in spots, these spots widening in circular form. This is a fungus\r\nthat spreads only in summer. The only means of eradicating so far\r\n(reported by the Texas station) is the application of common salt and\r\nkerosene. It has not proven a serious annoyance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOPHERS AND PRAIRIE DOGS\r\n\r\nGophers and prairie dogs are great pests in some parts of the Middle\r\nWest, and about the only successful means of combating them is poison.\r\nThe state of Kansas has, probably more than any other, made a systematic\r\neffort to destroy its gophers and prairie dogs, by liberal\r\nappropriations and a field agent to supervise the work to be carried\r\nout under provisions of law by local officials.\r\n\r\nThe injury done by the gophers consists chiefly in throwing up mounds of\r\nsoil taken from the burrows and these greatly interfere with operating\r\nthe mowing machine in harvesting. In the alfalfa fields there is also a\r\nnoticeable thinning out of the plants, by reason of the cutting off of\r\nthe roots. These root cuttings are stored in the burrows in considerable\r\npiles, and are used in cold weather by the gophers for food. It is\r\nclaimed by some alfalfa growers that this process of thinning out the\r\nplants is a benefit rather than an injury to the field, but, says Prof.\r\nD. E. Lantz, the official formerly in charge of the Kansas work, “I have\r\nknown fields where this thinning has continued until the crop did not\r\nhalf cover the ground at cutting time, and the fields were plowed up for\r\nthe planting of other crops. The loss from gopher depredations to the\r\nalfalfa growers of Kansas during 1901 was probably fully one-tenth of\r\nthe entire product, and had a money value of at least $500,000.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Lantz, carbon bisulphide and other poisonous\r\ngases have frequently been recommended for the destruction of the\r\npocket-gopher, but the great length of the burrows and their\r\nirregularities in depth prevent the gases from flowing into every part,\r\nand the animals often escape. Trapping, if properly done, is a sure\r\nmethod of killing the gopher; but it is attended with considerable labor\r\nand is very slow. An excellent trap for general use is the No. O\r\nordinary steel trap. Sink it in loose soil to the level of the runway,\r\nnearly conceal it by sprinkling fine earth over it, and leave the hole\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nGophers are easily poisoned. They are fond of potatoes, sweet potatoes,\r\napples, raisins and prunes. The presence of strychnine, arsenic or other\r\npoisons does not seem to deter them from eating the food; but if the\r\npoison is sweetened they seem to eat it more readily. In summer it may\r\nbe desirable to sweeten the poison, but in the fall and early spring it\r\ndoes not seem worth while. The poisoned food being introduced to the\r\nburrows below the surface, there is no danger of poisoning stock. It\r\nmight be well, however, not to let swine run in the fields for a time\r\nafter the poison has been put out.\r\n\r\nThe following method of introducing poison is recommended: Cut the\r\npotatoes or other food into pieces not more than three-fourths of an\r\ninch in diameter. Cut a slit in each piece and with a point of the knife\r\nblade insert a little sulphate of strychnine; as much as half the bulk\r\nof a grain of wheat. Having prepared the bait in sufficient quantity, go\r\nto the field armed with a round, sharp-pointed implement an inch or an\r\ninch and a half in diameter and of sufficient length. The tool here\r\nillustrated was made by a blacksmith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is a spade handle shod with an iron point. A bar is attached about\r\nfifteen inches from the point to enable the operator to use his foot in\r\npressing it into the soil. With this tool it is only necessary to find\r\nthe runway of the gopher. The handle is sufficiently thick to make a\r\nhole large enough to permit one to drop the poisoned potato directly\r\ninto the burrow. The operator then passes on to another place, leaving\r\nthe hole open. No digging with a spade or other hard labor is necessary.\r\nAn experienced person can distribute poison to many acres of alfalfa in\r\na day; and if proper care is taken to rightly distribute the bait, it\r\nwill not be necessary to go over the ground a second time. Some\r\nexperience is required to find the burrows quickly. It is best to insert\r\nthe food as near as possible to the freshest mounds of earth. Two or\r\nthree pieces of potato at that place are worth many scattered in other\r\nparts of the runway. The operator should avoid the larger mounds and\r\nthose that are not freshly made.\r\n\r\nFor destroying prairie dogs, Professor Lantz says that out of thousands\r\nof suggestions nothing has been found more effective than strychnine\r\npoison and carbon bisulphide. Following are directions for preparing and\r\nusing the strychnine:\r\n\r\n“Dissolve one and a half ounces of strychnine sulphate in a quart of hot\r\nwater. Add a quart of syrup--molasses, sorghum, or thick sugar and\r\nwater--and a teaspoonful of oil of anise. Thoroughly heat and mix the\r\nliquid. While hot pour it over a bushel of clean wheat and mix\r\ncompletely. Then stir in two or more pounds of fine corn meal. The\r\nquantity of corn meal needed will depend upon the amount of extra\r\nmoisture present. There should be enough to wet every grain of the wheat\r\nand no more. Care should be taken that there is no leakage from the\r\nvessel in which the wheat is mixed. Let the poisoned grain stand over\r\nnight, and distribute it in the early morning of a bright day. Use a\r\ntablespoonful of the wheat to each hole occupied by prairie dogs,\r\nputting it near the mouth of the burrow in two or three little bunches.\r\nDo not put out the poison in cold or stormy weather. It will keep for a\r\nconsiderable time, and is much more effective after a cold period, as\r\nthe animals are then hungry and eat the grain readily. A bushel of wheat\r\nshould poison 1000 to 1200 holes. An excellent substitute for the oil of\r\nanise in this formula can be made by soaking two ounces of green coffee\r\nberries in the whites of three eggs. Let this stand for about twelve\r\nhours, and use the liquid instead of anise oil.”\r\n\r\nA tablespoonful of carbon bisulphide, upon some such absorbent material\r\nas cotton, dry horse manure, or a piece of corn-cob, and rolled into the\r\nburrows, is effective. It is best immediately to cover the hole with a\r\nsod and stamp down firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASSHOPPERS\r\n\r\nGrasshoppers are a source of no little loss to alfalfa growers in some\r\nparts of the West. They usually do their greatest damage to the season’s\r\nsecond crop, the young not being very destructive to the first. The best\r\nremedy, or rather prevention, is deep disking in April and then\r\nharrowing to destroy the eggs.\r\n\r\nWhere the pests attack or are about to attack a field of alfalfa, Prof.\r\nL. Bruner, of the Nebraska station recommends the use of a “hopper\r\ndozer,” which is “simply a long, shallow pan of stove-pipe iron or\r\ngalvanized iron mounted on runners and backed by a light frame covered\r\nwith cloth. The pan is about four inches deep, from eighteen inches to\r\ntwo feet wide, and from ten to sixteen feet long. It is partly filled\r\nwith water and a little kerosene. A horse drags the machine across the\r\nfield over the stubble of the first crop and the half-grown hoppers\r\njump into the pan where the oil coats them over and kills every one that\r\nit touches. The hopper dozer works best on level land. On sloping ground\r\nthe oil and water run to one end and slop over. To prevent this the pan\r\nis usually divided into sections by a number of partitions. The runners\r\nshould stick out in front of the pan about a foot and one-half, and a\r\npiece of chain or heavy rope should be stretched loosely between them to\r\ndrag ahead of the machine and make the hoppers jump. On level fields\r\nthere are no great difficulties in the use of the hopper dozer. Careless\r\ndriving may spill oil on some alfalfa and kill it. If these machines are\r\nto be really effective, they must be used before the grasshoppers get\r\ntheir wings. The first crop of alfalfa should be cut as early as\r\npossible, and the hopper dozers should follow the rakes as closely as\r\nmay be. On the whole, they should be used only where plowing and\r\nharrowing have not been done or have failed to keep the grasshoppers in\r\ncheck.”\r\n\r\nOf the use of this implement or machine Prof. S. J. Hunter has this to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n“The height of the runners depends upon the height of crop to be\r\nprotected. It is important that there be no timbers in front of the pan,\r\nso that its front line may come in contact with the grain passed over.\r\nThe insects then fall directly into the fluid. When ready for use place\r\ntwo buckets of water and one-half gallon of coal-oil in a pan, and then\r\ndrive back and forth across the end of the field where the grasshoppers\r\nare entering until you have filled the pans; remove the insects,\r\nreplenish with oil and water, and continue until the field is rid of the\r\npest.\r\n\r\n“Many grasshoppers will be seen strike the sheet-iron back, drop into\r\nthe pans and immediately jump out again. Those farmers who observed the\r\nexperiments were at first of the opinion that the locusts that jumped\r\nout had jumped away ‘to live another day.’ The writer asked those\r\ninterested to watch the insects and note the actions of grasshoppers\r\nthat had jumped out. In every case the report was that the insects\r\nbecame sick and soon died. In fact, persons going over fields where a\r\nday or so before the hopper dozer had been at work, were impressed with\r\nthe number of dead grasshoppers on the ground. An examination showed the\r\npresence of coal-oil upon the body. This kerosene and water is an\r\nexternal irritant, and my observations have been that the mixture is\r\nmore effective than the oil alone.\r\n\r\n“The use of the machine may be best shown by examples. In Ford county,\r\nKansas, a large tract of alfalfa was cut, and the locusts at once began\r\nmoving into a large field of Kafir corn which had been sown broadcast.\r\nThe hopper dozer was drawn back and forth across the end of the corn\r\nfield nearest the alfalfa land until a portion of the field about twenty\r\nrods deep had been gone over. Here it was apparent that there were very\r\nfew grasshoppers; or, in other words, the advance line of the locusts’\r\nmarch only extended twenty rods into the field. Two days later the same\r\narea of ground was covered, but not as many insects were taken.\r\nGrasshoppers no longer entered this corn and the hopper dozer was no\r\nlonger used at this point.\r\n\r\n“It has been my experience with this machine that after it has passed\r\nover vegetation it does not injure the plants, but in some way renders\r\nthe vegetation distasteful to the grasshoppers, so that they turn their\r\ncourse and seek food elsewhere. I have observed that these native\r\ngrasshoppers enter a field from one corner or side, and that they are\r\nnot as a rule scattered over the whole field, but occur in great numbers\r\nin patches. This being the case, it is evident that with very little\r\nlabor with this machine the products of a field can be given full\r\nopportunity to mature.”\r\n\r\n\r\nARMY WORMS\r\n\r\nIn Nebraska the fall army worm has caused considerable damage. It is\r\ndistinct from the true army worm, having small hairs growing out from\r\nsmall black spots; it has a whitish “Y” shaped mark upon the head. The\r\nparent of the worms is a moth of a yellowish, ash-gray color. The female\r\nmoth deposits her eggs in clusters upon the leaves and stems. With the\r\napproach of cold weather the worms pass into the ground and enter the\r\nchrysalis stage about one or two inches below the surface. When very\r\nnumerous the only effective treatment is to disk thoroughly in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIND WEED\r\n\r\nBindweed, belonging to the morning-glory family, is one of the meanest\r\nweeds that annoy alfalfa raisers. It spreads from the root, and is more\r\nthan liable to smother out alfalfa or any other crop which tries to\r\noccupy its ground. If infested fields could be grazed closely with hogs\r\nor sheep, they might keep the bindweed down and finally eradicate it. If\r\nthis cannot be done, the only remedy is to plow and use the land for\r\nsome other crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXIV._\r\n\r\nDifficulties and Discouragements\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that alfalfa is now grown successfully in all\r\nparts of the United States, in almost all kinds of soils and under many\r\ndissimilar conditions of climate, there are grouped here as a summary\r\nfrom preceding chapters the several difficulties and discouragements\r\nthat may confront the one who would grow it.\r\n\r\n1. _Securing a Good Stand._ Theoretically, the farmer should secure a\r\ngood stand every year with every crop, but he does not. He obtains,\r\nhowever, poor stands of wheat and corn and potatoes oftener than a poor\r\nstand of alfalfa. Why does he fail with alfalfa? The following, at least\r\nin part, suggests why:\r\n\r\n_a_ He neglects to prepare sufficiently in advance. He should select his\r\nalfalfa field one or two years before he intends sowing. If he raises\r\nwheat, he should sow a little alfalfa seed with wheat, one or even two\r\nyears before ready for alfalfa. This will leave a few roots and the\r\nproper bacteria will have been introduced into the soil. For two years\r\nthere should be a vigorous fight against weeds, the fewest possible\r\nbeing permitted to ripen seed.\r\n\r\n_b_ He neglects to prepare properly for the preceding crop, and\r\nsometimes plants the wrong crop, although sorghum and Kafir corn are\r\nabout the only very objectionable planting to precede alfalfa. These\r\nhave usually taken too much of the land’s moisture, especially if the\r\nseason has been somewhat dry, to permit a prosperous beginning of the\r\nplants from fall sown seed. Millet, oats or cowpeas are the best crops\r\nto precede, i. e. for the first trial. The plowing for this preceding\r\ncrop should be deep. In clay land a subsoil plow (the kind which loosens\r\nbut does not throw the subsoil to the surface) should follow. It is\r\nextremely important that a dressing of stable manure be plowed under for\r\nthis preceding crop. The seed bed should be carefully prepared, and\r\nunder favorable conditions. Working the ground when too wet would make\r\nit impossible to secure a proper seed bed later when preparing for\r\nalfalfa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: And There’s Still More to Follow]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Dead Prairie Dogs=\r\n\r\ngathered up in a 20-minute walk through a “town” that had been poisoned.\r\nNearly all the animals die inside their burrows. The cost of destroying\r\nthem, according to Professor Lantz, is not over two cents per acre, not\r\ncounting the labor, and a man can distribute the poison over about a\r\nquarter-section in a day]\r\n\r\n_c_ He neglects to prepare the alfalfa seed bed properly. He should\r\nbegin disking and harrowing as soon as the preparatory crop is off the\r\nground, and continue this at intervals of ten or fifteen days until time\r\nfor sowing, when the soil should be as fine as for an onion bed.\r\n\r\n_d_ He uses poor seed; seed that is infertile, or adulterated with weed\r\nseeds--undesirable and unreliable in every way.\r\n\r\n2. _Dying out the second year_, which in most instances is due to one of\r\ntwo causes, viz.: neglect to plow under stable manure for the preceding\r\ncrop, or pasturing alfalfa in its first year. Not an animal should be\r\nturned on an alfalfa field for pasture until the second or, preferably,\r\nthe third year. Another cause is disturbance of the soil and plants by\r\nsevere freezing. This may often be prevented in a degree by a light\r\ntop-dressing of manure in December.\r\n\r\n3. _Failure through harvesting and stacking_.\r\n\r\n4. _Injury from insects or disease_.\r\n\r\nThese are practically all the things that need occasion serious\r\nvexation. Of course alfalfa calls for more work in harvesting than corn,\r\nor clover, or timothy; but one acre of prosperous alfalfa is worth two\r\nor three of corn, or clover or timothy, even for market, while for\r\nfeeding purposes the difference is even greater. The “poor” farmer, the\r\nlazy farmer, the “corner grocery” farmer should not sow alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXV._\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\n\r\n\r\nALFALFA IN THE ORCHARD\r\n\r\nProbably nine-tenths of those who have written on this subject have\r\ncondemned the practice of sowing alfalfa in the orchard. They have said\r\nthat the alfalfa demanded so much moisture that the trees would be\r\ndwarfed if not destroyed. In going through an immense amount of material\r\nin the preparation of this book only two instances have been found of\r\nmen who claim that the alfalfa is a benefit to orchards. One of these\r\nwas from Texas and the newspaper quoting him did not give his name. He\r\nwas reported to have used his orchard for hog pasture, keeping on five\r\nacres from ten to fifteen sows with their pigs from early April to\r\nSeptember. He claimed that the alfalfa instead of robbing the orchard of\r\nmoisture actually contributed to the surface moisture and benefited the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nProf. F. L. Watrous, of the Colorado station, is an earnest advocate of\r\nthe use of alfalfa in the orchard and from an article of his this is\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\n“Whatever may have been believed or imagined as to the uncongeniality of\r\ntrees and alfalfa the theory is destined to an early downfall. The\r\nevidence is at hand now to show that not only is alfalfa not a\r\ndetriment when grown among fruit trees, but in many ways it is a\r\npositive benefit, lending itself and its properties to the advantage of\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n“On land where moisture can be found at from six to ten feet from the\r\nsurface, the congeniality of the alfalfa plant and the apple tree\r\nbecomes apparent. Both need plenty of water the first year, a little\r\nless the second, and very little or none thereafter.\r\n\r\n“After trees become old enough to bear and need all the land between\r\nthem, and that fertilized and renovated, alfalfa may be used as a food\r\ngatherer and distributer. It pushes down into the lower strata, bringing\r\nup mineral elements, captures nitrogen from the air through its root\r\nprocesses, and brings all together near the surface, thus giving to the\r\ntrees the food they need to fill up and mature fruit. Nor is this all.\r\nThe alfalfa falling on the ground makes a soft cover upon which\r\nwindfalls may drop with little bruising; it so occupies the soil as to\r\nallow no foul growth to creep in; it does away with the work of weeding\r\nor cultivating, and keeps the surface cool and porous, furnishing\r\nexcellent pasture for hogs if the trees are protected. It would be\r\npossible, of course, in this system of co-operation between fruit trees\r\nand alfalfa to secure a crop of hay or seed during the off years for\r\nfruit, but whether this would prove profitable may be questioned.\r\nOrchards growing under the conditions described have produced\r\nmagnificent crops of fruit which, for size, quality and coloring, is\r\nseldom equaled.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ALFALFA “MUSTS” AND “DON’TS”\r\n\r\nA Knox county, Ohio, man, in expressing himself as to some of the\r\nrequisites for success with alfalfa, as observed from his viewpoint has\r\nthis to say:\r\n\r\n“I have known about alfalfa from boyhood; been familiar with it for\r\nthirty years, and have grown it successfully on many soils, from a stiff\r\nclay, upwards. The failures which I have seen have been accounted for by\r\nthe non-performance of some of the essentials. There are certain\r\n‘musts’, not ‘shoulds,’ to be observed to secure success. Here they are\r\nfrom my experience:\r\n\r\n“First of all the seed must be pure, of high germinating power, and of\r\nthe highest possible vitality. If I doubted my own proficiency in these\r\ndeterminations, I would consult the nearest experiment station. I have\r\nhad occasion to consult experiment stations, from New Jersey to\r\nWisconsin, on various subjects, and in every instance have met with\r\nprompt and valuable--and sympathetic--assistance.\r\n\r\n“The soil must have lime; either as one of its natural constituents, or\r\nlime must be added. If the soil is deficient, then the lime must be\r\nincorporated with the soil some months before seeding.\r\n\r\n“The land must have efficient drainage, either natural, or, as in the\r\ncase of clay and heavy clay loams, artificial.\r\n\r\n“The land must be fertile to a depth of at least nine inches. Beyond\r\nthat depth the taproot in its search for water will take care of\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\nAnother writer, impressed by practices he regards as reprehensible,\r\nenumerates them as follows:\r\n\r\n“Don’t sow any nurse crop.\r\n\r\n“Don’t sow on freshly plowed land, no matter how carefully prepared.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let weeds or grass grow over six inches high without clipping.\r\n\r\n“Don’t clip or mow when wet with rain or dew.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let alfalfa stand; if turning yellow, cut it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t sow old seed.\r\n\r\n“Don’t sow less than twenty pounds per acre, one-half each way.\r\n\r\n“Don’t sow twenty-five acres at first; sow five.\r\n\r\n“Don’t pasture it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t put any of the rotten manure anywhere but on your alfalfa plot.\r\n\r\n“Don’t depend upon ‘culture cakes’ or soil from some distant field.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let any water stand on it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let it go if a thin stand, but disk in more seed; don’t be afraid\r\nyou will kill it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t replow the land, disk it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t wait for it to stool; it never does.\r\n\r\n“Don’t try to cut for hay until the alfalfa takes the field.\r\n\r\n“Don’t sow on any land not well underdrained.\r\n\r\n“Don’t leave your land rough; use a roller or a plank float to level and\r\nsmooth it.\r\n\r\n“Don’t give up.”\r\n\r\n\r\nALFILERILLA OR “ALFILARIA”\r\n\r\n(_Erodium citcutarium_.)\r\n\r\nOn account of the similarity of its name to that of alfalfa and the\r\npossibility of the two plants being confused in the minds of those not\r\nacquainted with them, it is proper to make mention here of the plant\r\nreferred to in the caption above. It is not generally known nor widely\r\ndistributed, and has as yet its principal habitat in semi-arid parts of\r\nthe southwestern United States. The Century Dictionary calls it\r\nPin-clover or Pin-grass, and classifies it with the Geranium family.\r\nWebster’s Dictionary speaks of it as a weed in California. It is an\r\nannual and seeds profusely; a few seeds scattered over quite a large\r\narea result in a thorough seeding the second year. A stockman in Arizona\r\nwrites that it will grow on any kind of soil except alkali; that it was\r\nintroduced from Australia by sheep carrying it in their wool. It is a\r\nsouthern plant and should not be seeded largely north of the northern\r\nline of Oklahoma until tested by the experiment stations. It should not\r\nbe confused with alfalfa, as it is entirely dissimilar and not related.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this plant an Arizona editor writes the following:\r\n\r\n“It is by no means a new or experimental crop, for it was the main\r\nreliance of Arizona stockmen during ten years of drouth. We suppose that\r\nthe experiment stations in the West have given it little attention\r\nbecause it is as well known as alfalfa here, and millions of acres are\r\ncovered with it in various portions of the Territory.\r\n\r\n“We know from many years experience that alfilaria will thrive and keep\r\nstock in good condition where no grass roots would live through one of\r\nthe dry seasons. It is peculiarly adapted to the poorer soils in western\r\nKansas, Nebraska, the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, and portions of the\r\nnorthern section of Mexico.\r\n\r\n“Its merits are that it will grow in seasons so dry that other forage\r\nfails and that it will keep cattle in better health and condition as to\r\nflesh and growth than anything else we can grow in Arizona, not\r\nexcepting alfalfa. In the spring cattle and horses will go miles to find\r\nit and it is better than ‘condition powders’ to put them in condition\r\nfor summer growth.\r\n\r\n“What it will do on other classes of soil, under excess of moisture, is\r\na matter of experiment; but where it is needed most--as above outlined,\r\nthere is nothing that has ever been tested under these adverse\r\nconditions which can compare with alfilaria. This will be certified to\r\nby every ranchman and cattleman in this section of Arizona.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURING HAY IN THE STACK\r\n\r\nSome method of arriving at the quantity in a stack, rick, or mow without\r\nweighing it, is, at one time and another, found desirable by everyone\r\nwho has to do with loose hay. There can be no absolute rule laid down\r\nfor this because of the varying compactness the hay attains under\r\ndiffering conditions of coarseness or fineness, moisture, length of time\r\nstacked or stored and the weight which has rested upon it.\r\n\r\nFor prairie hay stacked not less than thirty days a cube seven feet\r\nsquare (343 cubic feet) is not uncommonly bought or sold as a ton; yet\r\nseven-and-a-half feet square, or 422 cubic feet, are often made the\r\nbasis of estimating. The author is advised that in the alfalfa growing\r\ndistricts of the Yellowstone valley it is the general custom to accept\r\nas a ton 422 cubic feet of alfalfa hay if it has settled thirty days or\r\nmore. Also that hay-men find there is a noticeable variation between the\r\ndifferent cuttings. The first cutting will fall short of actual weight\r\nmore than the second, while the third cutting will hold up in weight,\r\nand sometimes overrun. Prof. E. A. Burnett, of the Nebraska experiment\r\nstation, thinks an eight-foot cube, or 512 cubic feet, a fair figure.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ten Eyck says:\r\n\r\n“The rules for measuring hay in the stack will vary according to the\r\nlength of time the hay has been stacked and the kind and quality of the\r\nhay, and also according to the character of the stack. With alfalfa or\r\nprairie hay which has been stacked for thirty days it is usual to\r\ncompute an eight-foot cube or 512 cubic feet as a ton. When the hay has\r\nbeen stacked five or six months, usually a seven-and-a-half-foot cube or\r\n422 cubic feet is calculated for a ton. In old stacks which have been\r\nstacked a year or more a seven-foot cube or 343 cubic feet is allowed\r\nfor a ton.\r\n\r\n“There are different methods of measuring a stack, depending upon its\r\nshape and also its size. For a long stack or rick the usual method is to\r\nthrow a line over the stack measuring the distance (in two or three\r\nplaces, and use the average) from the bottom on one side to the bottom\r\non the other; add to this the average width of the stack, divide this\r\nsum by four (which equals one side of the square) and multiply the\r\nquotient by itself and this product by the length of the stack; this\r\nwill give the number of cubic feet in the stack, which may be divided by\r\n512, 422, or 343 in order to find the number of tons. For small, low\r\nricks the rule is to subtract the width from the ‘over,’ divide by 2,\r\nmultiply by the width and multiply the product by the length, dividing\r\nthe result by the number of cubic feet in a ton.\r\n\r\n“There is no established rule for measuring round stacks, but this one\r\nwill approximate the contents of one of the ordinary conical form: Find\r\nthe circumference at or above the base or ‘bulge’ at a height that will\r\naverage the base from there to the ground, find the vertical height of\r\nthe measured circumference from the ground and the slant height from the\r\ncircumference to the top of the stack. Multiply the circumference by\r\nitself and divide by 100 and multiply by 8, then multiply the result by\r\nthe height of the base plus one-third of the slant height of top. The\r\nhay in a round is necessarily less compact than in a rectangular stack,\r\nhence a greater number of feet should be allowed for a ton; with well\r\nsettled hay, probably 512 feet.\r\n\r\n“The rules given may also be used in measuring any kind of hay, sorghum\r\nor Kafir-fodder in the stack. However, for sorghum or Kafir-fodder only\r\napproximate results can be procured by stack measurements because the\r\nfodder is apt to vary greatly in weight, according to the moisture it\r\ncontains.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Pot Culture Experiments at University of Illinois=\r\n\r\nshowing effect produced upon growth of alfalfa by nitrogen-gathering\r\nbacteria obtained from older alfalfa and Sweet clover.

F. Duggar, Director Alabama experiment station._--Alfalfa is\r\ngrown in Alabama with entire success on the lime soil of the central\r\nprairie region of the state. This is a strip of land from 10 to 20 miles\r\nwide, extending southeast and northwest almost across the state and into\r\nMississippi. Beginning near Union Springs, this prairie passes near\r\nMontgomery, Selma, Demopolis, Greensboro and northwestward towards\r\nColumbus, Miss. On the prairie lands in this area alfalfa affords from\r\nthree to six cuttings per year, usually four, and the yield is from\r\nthree to six tons per acre. Irrigation is not practiced. The seed is\r\nsown either in September or in the early part of March, usually from 20\r\nto 24 pounds per acre. Almost a full crop is secured the first year from\r\nfall seeding, but only from one-third to two-thirds of a full crop is\r\nsecured the first year from sowing seed in March. It is not customary on\r\nthis soil to use fertilizer on alfalfa, but an application of even a\r\nlight coat of stable manure immensely increases the yield on the poor\r\nspots. Failure has generally attended attempts to grow alfalfa on\r\nnon-calcareous or sandy soils, though under favorable conditions, with\r\nliberal manuring and constant warfare against crab-grass, it\r\noccasionally succeeds. In Bulletin No. 127 of the Alabama experiment\r\nstation the results in alfalfa growing are summarized as follows:\r\nUsually the best crop to precede spring sown alfalfa is cotton,\r\nespecially if cotton follows melilotus (Sweet clover). The best crop to\r\nprepare the land for fall sown alfalfa is cowpeas, sown very thickly.\r\nFarmers have found that alfalfa thrives when sown on Johnson grass\r\nmeadows, holding its own, at least for the first few years, against this\r\naggressive grass. Dodder, a yellow threadlike growth, is a serious enemy\r\nof alfalfa. One of the remedies consists in mowing and burning. Seed\r\nmerchants often pass alfalfa seed through a machine which is claimed to\r\nremove the dodder seed. On sandy upland soils at Auburn, alfalfa has not\r\nafforded very profitable yields. On such soils it requires heavy\r\napplications of lime or barnyard manure, and it is believed that more\r\nprofitable use can be made of manure. At Auburn neither nitrate of soda\r\nnor cottonseed meal very greatly increased the yield of alfalfa that was\r\nproperly stocked with root tubercles. Acid phosphate and potash\r\nfertilizers are considered indispensable here, and generally advisable\r\non sandy or other soils not rich in lime. Inoculation with soil from old\r\nfields of either alfalfa or Bur clover greatly increases the yields of\r\nalfalfa growing on sandy land. The germ that causes tubercles to develop\r\non Sweet clover also causes tubercles to develop on the roots of\r\nalfalfa. Hence artificial inoculation of alfalfa is not necessary when\r\nit is grown on prairie land that has recently borne a crop of\r\nmelilotus. Artificial inoculation of alfalfa is probably advisable even\r\nfor prairie soils when it is uncertain whether either the melilotus or\r\nalfalfa germs are present in great numbers. In regions in Alabama where\r\nneither alfalfa, melilotus, nor Bur clover is extensively grown,\r\ninoculation of alfalfa is advisable. For this purpose one may use soil\r\nfrom old fields of either of these plants or inoculating material\r\nprepared in the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nARIZONA\r\n\r\n_John Blake, Graham county._--Alfalfa is the king of forage plants here.\r\nIt will stand considerable dry weather and live, but it will not yield\r\nprofitably unless irrigated, or on naturally damp ground. It does not do\r\nwell here on clay soil, and if clay subsoil is near the surface it is\r\nlikely to dry out, unless watered. I have grown alfalfa for eight years\r\non 175 acres, first and second bottom, and upland, with sandy and loam\r\nsoils, with small patches of clay and various subsoils; the alluvial\r\nbottoms are usually loam of different depths, underlaid with sand and\r\ngravel; the next bottom more clayey, with quicksand about 13 feet deep\r\nand gravel about 30 feet below the surface. On first bottoms, well water\r\nis reached at a depth of 3 to 8 feet, the soil being dry on the surface\r\nonly; on the upland, the soil is dry for 20 to 30 feet, or until water\r\nis reached. Land intended for alfalfa had best be cultivated in other\r\ncrops for two or three years, thus insuring the killing off of native\r\nbrush and grass, and their roots; then it must be laid off in “lands” of\r\nvarious widths, according to the slope, each land being leveled\r\nuniformly and bordered to hold water. Seed may be sown in August,\r\nSeptember, and October; in fact, all the year, except from the middle\r\nof April to the first of August, when it is so hot and dry here. The\r\nquantity of seed used varies with the preparation, from 12 to 20 pounds\r\nper acre. Sow with a “Cahoon” seeder, and cover with a brush or light\r\nharrow. It is generally sown here with barley, wheat, or oats. The grain\r\nis cut early for hay, or ripened and headed, in which case the stubble\r\nand alfalfa are cut immediately afterward and hauled off. The ground is\r\nthen irrigated, and if it has previously been foul, there will be plenty\r\nof weeds. Another cutting in good time will usually eradicate these. The\r\nplant will not winterkill here if old enough to have four leaves before\r\nfrost. We irrigate abundantly, from the Gila river, in winter and\r\nspring, filling up the soil and thus making less need for water during\r\nthe hot, dry period. Irrigate after each crop is taken off, and some\r\nland is benefited by two irrigations for each cutting. The quantity of\r\nwater needed depends on the character of the soil and subsoil; some on\r\nthe bottoms needs but little after the first year, and it is a good\r\nplan, if the subsoil is open, to let the plant go without artificial\r\nwater after it has a good start, as it sends its roots down to moisture\r\nor water, if at a reasonable depth below; it will then thrive on much\r\nless water, and the crop will be more nutritious. If one is raising hay\r\nfor quantity, of course this does not apply. The four crops per season\r\nyield on an average: First, 1¹⁄₂ to 2 tons; second and third, 1¹⁄₄ to 4;\r\nfourth, three-fourths to one ton. If cutting for quantity, mow when\r\nfairly in bloom; if for feeding, when the seed has formed. I have raised\r\nno seed, but the crop used for that purpose is usually the second, and\r\nit is not irrigated. The time required for curing depends on the stage\r\nat which the hay is cut, the dryness of the ground, etc.; a good rule is\r\nto rake as soon as the rake will take it up clean, and let it cure in\r\nwindrows or cocks. I use a “Landen” single pole stacker, with slings,\r\nwhich puts the hay, just as it laid on the wagon, in the center of the\r\nstack. The seed, threshed on an ordinary thresher, contains straw and\r\nchaff, which are easily taken out by running through ordinary wire\r\nscreen-door netting, and then it is suitable for the “Cahoon” seeder. On\r\nland worth $40 per acre, the hay in the stack costs $3 per ton. Baling\r\ncosts $2 per ton, the best size being 100 or 150 pounds in weight. Size\r\ndoes not affect the keeping quality of the hay. The hay has sold here\r\nfor $6 to $12, averaging about $7.50, and the seed sold here last year\r\nfor 9 cents per pound. I do not think the straw is of much value.\r\nAlfalfa will yield abundantly the second year, and, if harrowed with a\r\ngood harrow, digging up the soil, it will yield for a very long period.\r\nMine, which is 10 years old, looks as well as it did when two years old.\r\nTo rid land of it, it would be well to plow when dry, then cross plow\r\nlater on. On naturally damp bottom it is hard to kill. Cattle pastured\r\non rank alfalfa in the spring are liable to bloat.\r\n\r\n_Thomas C. Graham, Pinal county._--Though I have been familiar with\r\nalfalfa growing for 10 years, my first experience on a large scale was\r\nfive years ago, when I seeded the Kenilworth farms, containing 900\r\nacres. I was successful in securing a good stand on the entire tract.\r\nSome of the land is upland, with sandy loam soil, washed from the\r\nmountains, and various subsoils, hardpan being, in places, only 10\r\ninches below the surface; the remainder of the land is low, or bottom,\r\nwith adobe soil. Well water is found at a depth of 95 feet, and the soil\r\nis dry from the surface to within a few feet of the water stratum.\r\nBefore sowing, the surface soil is plowed and harrowed thoroughly; 20\r\npounds of seed is used to the acre, and covered not more than one-half\r\ninch deep. In our section, the best time for seeding is in September and\r\nOctober, and there is no danger from the winter frost. During the first\r\nseason we cut twice or three times, to destroy all weeds, and obtain\r\n2¹⁄₂ or 3 tons of hay per acre, but have never been able to get a paying\r\ncrop of seed from the first season’s cutting. For irrigation, we obtain\r\nwater from the Gila and Salt rivers, but in some sections of our country\r\nwater is pumped from wells by steam pumps. It has not been found\r\npracticable to lift the water from a greater depth than 50 feet for this\r\npurpose. The first year, as the land is very dry, it requires twice the\r\nquantity of water that is needed the second year and after. We flood the\r\nalfalfa five or six times a year--once in the fall, in the spring, and\r\nafter each cutting, using water enough to cover the land to a depth of\r\nabout one inch. We have no rain to amount to anything here, and depend\r\nentirely on irrigation. I think the ground should be prepared in the\r\nfall, and seeded in February or March as, if seeded in the fall, the\r\nyoung plants might be liable to injury from frost. In all cases, the\r\nsoil should be thoroughly prepared, and the seed not covered more than\r\none-half inch deep. It is not uncommon to harvest six crops of alfalfa\r\nin a single season, and its feeding qualities are unequaled for cattle,\r\nhorses, or swine. It is found, by careful tests, that alfalfa is 45 per\r\ncent better than clover and 65 per cent better than timothy for feeding\r\nfarm animals. In my opinion, there is no other hay that will equal\r\nproperly cured alfalfa. That grown without irrigation is much better, as\r\nit contains less sap and is not so stalky. The threshed hay is splendid\r\nfeed for milch cows, and is sold here for the same price brought by the\r\nhay cut earlier. Last season I pastured 65 head of hogs on 10 acres of\r\nalfalfa, and they did well. In my experience, it is far better than\r\nclover, from the fact that it cannot be dislodged, the roots penetrating\r\nto a depth of 10 to 20 feet. The pasturage is profitable and\r\nsatisfactory for sheep and horses, and 45 per cent better for cattle\r\nthan clover. They will bloat sometimes, but if properly handled there is\r\nlittle danger. The best preventive is to not allow the cattle to become\r\ntoo hungry. We get, on an average, three cuttings a year, averaging 1 to\r\n1¹⁄₂ tons per acre each, and have pasture for five or six months. For\r\nhay, we mow when in full bloom, rake as soon as possible, and let stand\r\nin windrows until the stems are about half dry; then put in the cock for\r\ntwo days, and stack in large ricks of about 80 to 100 tons each. If put\r\nup damp or green, it will mold. The seed is harvested, usually, from the\r\nsecond crop, when the pods turn black and can be shelled out by rubbing\r\nin the hand. It is cut, raked in windrows, and allowed to stand until\r\nthoroughly dry. I used, this season, a J. I. Case separator, and\r\nthreshed and cleaned 6000 pounds of seed in three days. An ordinary\r\nyield is 100 pounds to the acre, and the cost of cutting and threshing\r\nis 3 cents a pound. The total cost of the hay in the stack is about $3\r\na ton on $50 land, with 15 cents an acre for irrigation. The average\r\nselling price for hay is $4 a ton, and for seed, 10 cents a pound. With\r\nproper care, alfalfa will last time without end, and improve each year,\r\nand it is difficult to kill it out, as it makes more or less seed every\r\ncrop. An open soil, free from hardpan, is best for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n_Henry Miller, San Mateo county._--Since 1871, we have gradually\r\nincreased our acreage of alfalfa, until we now have about 20,000 acres.\r\nThis is on reclaimed swamp and upland, under a complete system of\r\nirrigation, with the exception of a little light, loamy soil, with water\r\nnear the surface and no irrigation. On the latter ground the plant is\r\nshort-lived, on account of the gophers. The depth at which well water is\r\nfound varies from 10 to 40 feet, and, with irrigation, it is immaterial\r\nwhether the soil is naturally moist or dry. The preparation for seeding\r\nconsists of deep plowing and cross plowing, and the depth for planting\r\nis not over two or three inches. For light, loamy soils, 12 pounds of\r\nseed to the acre is ample, while for hard, rough, new land, from 16 to\r\n20 pounds is required to insure a good stand. Seeding may be done here\r\nafter the cold season, and when danger of heavy frost is past, but in\r\ntime to take advantage of the spring rains, which are very essential.\r\nDuring the first season, the weeds should be mowed as they require it,\r\nwithout regard to returns of alfalfa, and after they are subdued it is\r\nwell to let the first year’s growth go to seed and allow it to be\r\ntrampled into the soil by young stock, but if there is a full stand this\r\nis not necessary. We irrigate from streams, applying water as soon as\r\nthe spring opens and every time a crop is cut, the quantity of water\r\nneeded depending on the quality of the soil. Drainage is very necessary,\r\nespecially when irrigation is done in warm weather. After the first\r\nirrigation, less water is needed at an application than at first.\r\nWinterkilling seems to be effectually prevented by watering in the fall.\r\nAlfalfa will attain its best state in three or four years, and its\r\ncondition after that will depend upon its treatment. We put stock on our\r\nland generally after the first and second growth is cut, and the only\r\nrest the land receives is when it is being irrigated. After hay has been\r\ncut for several years, we harrow in the spring with a heavy harrow or\r\ndisk cutter, and take the opportunity to reseed that which shows lack of\r\nvigor. The more sun and the less shade there is, the better the growth\r\nand the more satisfactory the yield. We find it more difficult to get a\r\nstand than to get rid of it; but, in some instances, where we have\r\nwanted the land for orchard, vegetables, or root crops, we found several\r\nplowings would destroy it. Without irrigation, we have not found the\r\ncrop very profitable, but there are a few favored spots in the state\r\nwhere it can be grown without water; but when we plant we usually select\r\nsuch land as can be put under a perfect system of irrigation before\r\nusing. Longevity of the plant depends on treatment and on the nature of\r\nthe soil. On heavy adobe soil it will not live and thrive as long as on\r\nloamy soil, and on sandy, light soil it will be of short duration\r\nwithout constant and judicious irrigation. After the first season, we\r\nmake two cuttings a year, and consider two tons to the acre each time a\r\ngood yield. For hay, we cut when the first crop is moderately ripe--say\r\nnearly in full bloom; the second crop and any later ones are cut when\r\nthe bloom first shows; otherwise the lower leaves will drop off. The\r\nfirst crop is generally preferable for seed, provided butterflies and\r\nother insects have not injured the bloom, as they often do. If the\r\nsecond crop is used for seed, it should ripen longer than the first. The\r\ncrop for seed is mowed, windrowed as soon as possible, allowed to dry in\r\nthat state, gathered with a hand fork, loaded on hay wagons, and put in\r\nstack as gently as possible. We find a good crop of seed a rare thing,\r\nbut use the ordinary threshing outfit, and turn out 800 to 1000 pounds a\r\nday, in rare instances double that quantity, with a cost for threshing\r\nand cleaning of about 5 cents a pound. The hay we never put in barns,\r\nbut stack in small, narrow ricks, to avoid danger of heating,\r\nendeavoring to get it in the rick as dry as possible, gathering in the\r\nforenoons to avoid shelling. When we use our own press and men, the cost\r\nof baling does not exceed $1 per ton. The weight of the bale depends on\r\nthe kind of press used. An average, handy bale weighs about 150 to 175\r\npounds, and we never have any trouble about the hay keeping perfectly in\r\nbales of that size. The average price per ton for hay in our San\r\nFrancisco market is about $8 to $10; of seed, by the ton, 8 to 12¹⁄₂\r\ncents a pound, 10 cents a pound being about the usual average price. For\r\nfeeding farm animals, good, well-cured alfalfa hay is better than\r\nclover. For milch stock, especially, we consider it fully as good as any\r\nother hay. We find but little difference between the straw and the hay,\r\nand while all stock like the straw better, there is no doubt that the\r\nhay contains the more nutriment. Like all rank growths, alfalfa will\r\nproduce double under irrigation, and the quantity will greatly\r\noverbalance any possible improvement in quality without irrigation, for\r\nI have found little difference between that grown by irrigation and\r\nunder natural moisture. For horses, there is no pasture better than the\r\nalfalfa; for sheep and cattle, it sometimes works injury by way of\r\nbloat, caused by too rapid grazing, especially when there is dew, thin\r\ncattle and young stock being most liable. Cattle in high condition and\r\ncows suckling or well forward in calf do not bloat. As preventive of the\r\nbloat, hay should be kept in the pasture where the stock can run to it,\r\nand a good supply of salt in troughs to which they have constant access.\r\nThe plant will not stand trampling by stock unless the surface of the\r\nground be entirely dry, and we do not allow sheep or cattle on the\r\nfields during certain stages of growth nor during certain states of the\r\nweather. We consider this pasture better than clover for swine,\r\nespecially when the ground has a smooth surface, but if the soil is of a\r\nsandy nature, and allowed to dry, it is not so good. The capacity per\r\nacre depends on the nature of the soil, and the gain in weight made by\r\nthe hogs depends on the breed and on the comfort they have. We can raise\r\nhogs on alfalfa, and by feeding them two months on grain (say barley,\r\nwheat, or Egyptian corn) they will average, when 10 months old, 250\r\npounds, gross.\r\n\r\n_J. B. De Jarnette, Colusa county._--I have had 11 years’ experience\r\nwith alfalfa, and have about 100 acres bordering on the Sacramento\r\nriver. The soil ranges in depth from 10 to 20 feet, and rests on a clay\r\nsubsoil, while water is reached at a depth of from 12 to 20 feet. In\r\nsinking two wells on my place, the soil was found as follows: First 12\r\nfeet, decomposed vegetable matter; 4 feet of quicksand; 4 feet of clay\r\nloam; 4 feet of hardpan; 16 feet of yellow clay; 6 feet of hardpan; 2\r\nfeet of black sand, and at 48 feet, coarse gravel. The ground should be\r\nthoroughly pulverized--the finer the better--after plowing at least 12\r\ninches deep, and then seeded with not less than 25 pounds of seed to the\r\nacre. I have had the best results from sowing in the early fall,\r\nimmediately after the first rains, using the “Gem” seeder, harrowing in\r\nwith very light harrow, and rolling the ground well. The first crop is\r\nusually quite weedy, and of little value, but the second is better,\r\nproducing about 1¹⁄₂ tons of hay to the acre, if the stand is good.\r\nStock of all kinds should be kept off the first year. There is no danger\r\nhere of winterkilling, and by the second year the full yield is\r\nrealized. The length of time the plant continues vigorous depends on the\r\ntreatment. If pastured extensively, it will require to be reseeded in\r\nfrom five to eight years; but otherwise it may go considerably longer. I\r\ninvariably obtain three crops a year, averaging per acre for the first\r\n2¹⁄₂, and for the others 1¹⁄₂ to 2 tons. I irrigate only in the winter,\r\nwhen the river is bank full and I can turn in water from it. Alfalfa\r\nproduces the best results with irrigation after each cutting, and in\r\nthat case there are five to seven cuttings obtainable, where with winter\r\nflooding I can secure the three only. I mow for hay as soon as the bloom\r\nbegins to develop, raking in the afternoon following the morning\r\ncutting, commence hauling about the third day after, and then put in the\r\nbarn with plenty of salt. The third crop is given the preference for\r\nseed, and is harvested when the plant is well matured. I let it cure in\r\nthe windrows and haul to the thresher, handling as little as possible.\r\nThe common yield of seed is from 100 pounds up, according to the stand.\r\nThe cost of my hay, on land worth $100 to $150 per acre, does not exceed\r\n$2 per ton, and it sells for from $5 to $8, while seed brings from 8 to\r\n16 cents per pound. The hay after threshing is of but little value. The\r\npasture is unquestionably the most profitable I have ever had any\r\nexperience with, supporting more stock of any kind to the acre than any\r\nother forage plant. In early spring, cattle are liable to bloat on the\r\nrank alfalfa, but after the first of June I have had no trouble. There\r\nis no special difficulty in ridding land of the plant, and it is\r\nundoubtedly as good for fertilizing as Red clover.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORADO\r\n\r\n_Jacob Downing, Arapahoe county._--I introduced alfalfa into Colorado in\r\n1862, and have between 500 and 700 acres. It is on upland, clay, sandy\r\nand loam soil, with some adobe subsoil, but mostly sandy loam; it is\r\ngenerally dry to sand rock, and then it is necessary to drill 50 to 100\r\nfeet to get water. The plant will not thrive where there is hardpan, but\r\nwill grow in any soil that is dry. Unlike most other forage plants it\r\nderives considerable nourishment from the air and water, though too much\r\nmoisture will kill it. After deep plowing and thorough pulverizing of\r\nthe soil, the land should be scraped thoroughly smooth, as this cannot\r\nbe done after sowing, and is needed to make the mower work smoothly. I\r\nsow about 25 pounds to the acre, drilling in about two inches deep,\r\n12¹⁄₂ pounds one way, and the other 12¹⁄₂ pounds across it, thus making\r\nan even stand. Prefer to sow in the spring, early. After the plant is\r\neight inches high, it may be cut and used for feed, but is not very\r\ngood. After this there will be no weeds. It matures in three years, and\r\nafter that is good for seed. I have seen, near the city of Mexico,\r\nfields of alfalfa 300 years old that had been constantly cropped and\r\nnever reseeded. It will last 1000 years, and possibly forever. Irrigate\r\nfrom streams, as is required; when there is a great deal of heat and\r\nwind, probably three times. The water must not run too long, or the\r\nplant will be killed, and the land should be kept as dry as possible\r\nduring the winter, particularly in cold climates, as on wet soil alfalfa\r\nwinterkills. Well water is better than the stream, provided it is pumped\r\ninto a reservoir and allowed to get warm. Water is brought from the\r\nstreams by ditches. Less water can be used the first year than after the\r\nplant is matured. I am five miles west of Denver, and 500 feet above the\r\ncity, in warm valleys. With plenty of water, I can obtain three cuttings\r\na year. Have raised as much as 3¹⁄₂ tons to the acre at one cutting, and\r\nmy highest yield of seed per acre has been nine bushels. Hay is cut when\r\nthe plant is in bloom, cured until it is dry to the touch of the hand.\r\nStacking by hand makes the best hay, as machinery is likely to pack it\r\nin bunches, causing it to heat and become dusty. Hay in the stack costs\r\nabout $1.50 per ton. Baling costs $2 per ton; 100-pound bales are well\r\nesteemed, but it is probable that large bales keep better than small, if\r\nproperly cured. The seed pod assumes the form of a cornucopia, and, when\r\nthe seed is ripe, it is of a rich brown or mahogany color. The first\r\ncrop is preferable for seed, and should be cut and stacked as the hay\r\nis. It can be left and threshed when most convenient, but the longer it\r\nremains in the stack the more easily its threshes. The ordinary\r\nthreshing machine does for the alfalfa, but the seed must be fanned to\r\nbe marketable. Six bushels is a common yield, and the cost of threshing\r\nand cleaning is probably 25 cents per bushel. The price of hay has\r\nranged from $5 to $15 per ton, and of seed, from 8 to 20 cents per\r\npound. The straw has almost no value, as it is cut up very fine, and can\r\nbe used only where it is threshed; if fed there, it is very fattening.\r\nFor feeding horses for slow work, the hay is better than clover or\r\ntimothy. For fattening purposes, it is the best in the world, for, while\r\nthe animal lays on fat, it is never feverish, but always healthy. For\r\npasturing cattle and swine, alfalfa is superior to anything else, and,\r\nafter it is mown, it makes very excellent feed for horses and sheep. If\r\nthe alfalfa is wet, ruminants pastured on it bloat and die very quickly.\r\nIt is not properly a pasture plant, and such animals should be kept away\r\nfrom it, but the hay, properly cured, is superior to any other food\r\nraised for fattening purposes. There is no difficulty in ridding land of\r\nthe plant, as a good team and sharp plow will cut it out without any\r\ntrouble. I have plowed fields of alfalfa under and put in oats,\r\nobtaining three or four times the usual yield, and have known of 50\r\nbushels of wheat to the acre on broken alfalfa land.\r\n\r\n_L. W. Markham, Prowers county._--I have had four years’ experience with\r\nalfalfa. Have under my charge 500 acres. It is on both second bottom and\r\nupland; part has clay subsoil, other dark loam, and all has more or\r\nless sand. Water is reached at from 10 to 40 feet, and on land not\r\nirrigated the soil is dry all the way down to the water veins. The\r\npreferred time for sowing is either April 1 or August 1. Have as good\r\nsuccess right on the sod as on old land. If to raise seed only, 10\r\npounds is sufficient to the acre; for hay, 20 pounds is not too much.\r\nSeed not more than two inches deep. About June 15 cut weeds and tops of\r\nyoung alfalfa, and then irrigate well, and you get one-half to one ton\r\nof hay in September. It is best to not try for seed the first year, but\r\ngive all the strength to the roots. It does not winterkill here. We\r\nirrigate from the Arkansas river, and the number of irrigations depends\r\non the soil. The first year requires twice as much water as later ones.\r\nUsually three applications are needed: in early spring, mid-summer, and\r\nlate fall. I have 160 acres not irrigated for three years. We have three\r\ncuttings, yielding 1¹⁄₂ to 2 tons per acre each. Cut for hay just when\r\ncoming into full bloom, and stack in the field--never in barn--in long\r\nricks, 12 feet wide by 80 to 120 feet long. It will not heat in the\r\nstack. Let all pods become dark brown or black before cutting for seed.\r\nThe second crop is preferable, unless there is a large acreage, when I\r\ntake one-half the first crop and one-half the second, in order to help\r\nthe farmer out with work. Have men follow the machine closely, and cock\r\nup, to remain four or five days before stacking. Never cut for seed with\r\na mowing machine, as you will lose one-third of the crop in trying to\r\ngather it. The cost of alfalfa in the stack is not over $2 at the\r\noutside. To bale--preferably in 80-pound bales--costs $1.50 per ton. An\r\nordinary yield of seed is five bushels per acre. The cost for threshing\r\nis 60 cents per bushel. There is a special alfalfa huller, as even the\r\nordinary clover huller is not a success. For a number of years the\r\naverage price paid the farmer for alfalfa seed has been $4.50 per\r\nbushel, and hay in the stack has sold for $3.50 to $5. For feeding farm\r\nanimals, alfalfa hay is far more valuable than timothy or clover. Horses\r\nwill work and do well the year round on the first cutting of alfalfa,\r\nand no grain whatever. The pasturage for hogs and cattle is far better\r\nthan clover, and is profitable and satisfactory for horses and sheep. I\r\nhave 250 hogs now, and raise them to weigh 200 pounds on green alfalfa\r\nalone; turn the sows in the lot in early spring; they raise their young,\r\nand I never bother them for eight months at a time, as they have plenty\r\nof alfalfa and water. Put cattle on the pasture in early spring and let\r\nthem run, and few, if any, will bloat; but when they are not used to it,\r\nthey eat too fast, or too much, and bloat. The hay is not so good after\r\nit is threshed as that cut earlier for hay alone, but the straw sells\r\nreadily at $1.50 in the stack. The stand gets better every year for hay,\r\nand I know of fields in old Mexico 60 years old that have never been\r\nreseeded. There is no difficulty in ridding land of the plant if it is\r\nplowed under eight inches deep while green. It makes far better green\r\nmanure than does red clover. On the same quarter section, wheat grown on\r\nold wheat land produced 20 bushels per acre, and that on broken alfalfa\r\nland 50 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT\r\n\r\n_Dr. E. H. Jenkins, Director Connecticut experiment station._--Alfalfa\r\nhas been tried in a haphazard way in Connecticut for many years and\r\nscattered plants and colonies may often be seen in fence corners and\r\nheadlands. Within five years, however, some farmers under direction of\r\nthe agricultural station at New Haven, or on their own initiative, have\r\nmade more careful experiments and while failures are numerous, there are\r\nat present a number of small areas well established, yielding three or\r\nfour cuttings yearly and highly valued by their owners. On the farm of\r\nC. W. Beach of West Hartford, F. H. Stadmueller had for seven years a\r\nconsiderable field of alfalfa which yielded well and was used as a\r\nsoiling crop. Mr. Barnard of North Haven, after repeated failures, has a\r\nfine field and feeds it to both cows and poultry. The Gaylord Farm\r\nsanatorium at Wallingford, John Matthies of New Milford and others might\r\nbe cited as successful growers of alfalfa. It does well on a variety of\r\nsoils with us. Liming heavily, 1500 to 2000 pounds per acre, is a\r\nnecessity. Some form of inoculation of the soil is generally required\r\nand clean, well-tilled land. Weeds are the worst enemy of the newly\r\nseeded alfalfa and easily smother the crop. For that reason we prefer\r\nAugust seeding, using at least 30 pounds of clean, fresh seed. It will\r\npay to fallow the land, in order to kill the weeds before seeding down.\r\nThin spots cannot be successfully patched by seeding later. Great care\r\nin preparing the land pays with a permanent crop like alfalfa.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARE\r\n\r\n_Dr. Arthur T. Neale, Director Delaware experiment station._--Twenty\r\nyears ago, I drilled alfalfa in rows 18 inches apart, and cultivated at\r\nintervals of ten days until the crop occupied the ground, seeding late\r\nin March, say the 28th. The first cutting of nearly 8 tons of green\r\nforage per acre was made nine weeks later. Thereafter four additional\r\ncuttings were made that season, resulting in a total yield of 21 tons of\r\ngreen forage per acre. This plot remained in good profit, all told, for\r\nfive years. An adjoining plot seeded broadcast, grew into a weed crop\r\nthe first year, but during four succeeding years was in every respect\r\nthe equal of its neighbor, the drilled plot. Twenty similar experiments\r\nmade during that year in as many other sections of the state failed\r\nutterly. The dates of seeding were in every instance subsequent to March\r\n28, but followed each other as rapidly as men could travel from point to\r\npoint, drilling the seed on well and previously prepared soil. Two years\r\nlater nine similar failures resulted from spring seedings. Late summer\r\nis now the time most frequently selected for alfalfa seedings, but\r\nsuccess is by no means invariably attained even then. Liming has been of\r\nservice in one five-acre test conducted in Kent county, by W. H. Dickson\r\nin co-operation with this station. The third trial within four\r\nconsecutive years appears at present to be a complete success. The first\r\nseeding gave a satisfactory stand, but the plants died late in the\r\nfollowing spring. The ground was limed that summer, after thorough\r\npreparation of the seedbed. Nitro-cultures from federal sources were\r\nused upon portions of the seed, and 1000 pounds of soil per acre from a\r\nsuccessful alfalfa plantation were applied to the other areas. This\r\nsecond seeding also failed. The five-acre plot was then plowed, wheat\r\nwas drilled and a fair crop resulted. The wheat was harvested, lime was\r\nagain used after the seedbed had been prepared, and alfalfa seed sown\r\nas usual. The crop this year has exceeded anticipations. The check\r\nstrip, to which no lime whatever has been applied, but upon which\r\nnitro-cultures were used, carries no crop. It will be disked after the\r\nthird cutting of alfalfa this year, well limed and again seeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGIA\r\n\r\n_Prof. R. J. Redding, Director Georgia experiment station._--This\r\nstation has successfully cultivated alfalfa for 12 years, and we have\r\nnever found it necessary to inoculate when we have sown the seed on\r\nrich, well prepared land. The plants at once became supplied with\r\nnitrogen tubercles and grew as luxuriantly as might be expected from the\r\nquality of the land. Our practice is to fertilize annually in January or\r\nFebruary by sowing from 800 to 1000 pounds of acid phosphate and\r\none-fourth as much muriate of potash per acre. We run a cutaway harrow\r\nover the alfalfa two or three times in different directions. We then use\r\na smoothing harrow and finally a heavy roller. This puts the land in\r\ngood shape for the mowing machine and at the same time destroys weeds\r\nthat come up during the fall and early winter. I believe that it is not\r\ndesirable to continue land in alfalfa more than six or eight years,\r\nbecause of the impossibility of preventing infestation of weeds to such\r\nextent as to very greatly diminish the yield of alfalfa. We have a plot\r\ngrowing, that was sown about April 10, which seems to be as favorable a\r\ntime as any, provided there shall be one or two good rains to give the\r\nyoung plants a start. The main factors in success are: First, a deep,\r\nwell-prepared and well-drained soil, made very rich; and second, good\r\nseed, carefully sown and repeated mowings at the proper time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDAHO\r\n\r\n_H. W. Kiefer, Bingham county._--I have grown alfalfa in Idaho, under\r\nirrigation, for 12 years. Have 40 acres on second bottom, heavy clay\r\nsoil for 12 feet. This subsoil pulverizes by the action of the air, and\r\nwill produce a good crop of small grain. Water is reached at 100 feet.\r\nThe 12 feet of clay is dry; the gravel and sand below are more or less\r\nmoist till water is reached. Land having produced two successive crops\r\nof small grain is preferred for alfalfa. Sow 20 pounds, in the spring,\r\nand cover lightly with harrow, brush, or drag, or roll. The plants\r\nshould be vigorous enough to choke out weeds. Amount of hay obtained the\r\nfirst year is governed by conditions and treatment. When sudden freezing\r\nand thawing occur, it is liable to winterkill. The frequency of our\r\nirrigation is governed by the rainfall, but is usually done when the\r\nground is dry, without regard to stage of growth, allowing the water to\r\nrun until the soil is wet the depth of a spade; usually average two\r\nirrigations to each cutting. Our supply of water comes from Snake river\r\nand tributaries, which furnish sufficient for the Snake river valley.\r\nHave noticed no difference in amount of water required during first or\r\nlater years, except as affected by the amount of rainfall. We get three\r\ncuttings, averaging about five tons for the season, cutting for hay when\r\nin bloom, and for seed when seed is matured, which generally requires\r\nthe entire season to mature in this locality. The seed crop should be\r\nhandled as little as possible, to avoid loss of seed. Alfalfa should\r\ncure at least two days, and, if dry, will not mold in stack. The cost of\r\nalfalfa hay, if irrigated, is about $2 per ton. Cost of baling, $1.75\r\nper ton, in bales weighing 75 to 100 pounds, the keeping being governed\r\nmore by the solidity than size of bale. During the past six years, hay\r\nhas averaged about $4 per ton, in the stack, and seed about 8 cents per\r\npound. Alfalfa makes satisfactory pasturage for sheep and horses. Cattle\r\nare liable to bloat, but, if taken in time, may be relieved with a gag,\r\nand by exercise which will cause the gases to escape; the knife is used\r\nas a last resort. The straw from which seed has been threshed has about\r\nthe same value as green oat straw. The various soils here appear equally\r\nfavorable to longevity. Usually the third year gives about the best\r\nyield. If not damaged by freezing, it will not need reseeding for 10 or\r\n15 years. We have no trouble in ridding land of alfalfa. We cut a hay\r\ncrop, and plow under, for spring wheat, with good results. Our best\r\nalfalfa land is clay, which requires moisture, artificial or natural.\r\nOur best yields have been six tons per acre for the season. The feeding\r\nqualities of the hay have been well established.\r\n\r\n_James Otterson, Logan county._--Have had 12 years’ experience growing\r\nalfalfa on sagebrush land, that will grow nothing but sagebrush without\r\nirrigation. It is fine, sandy loam, extending down 6 to 10 feet, where\r\nlava is encountered, which is from 1 to 100 feet deep. The soil is dry\r\nuntil water is struck, which is at a depth of from 100 to 200 feet.\r\nThere is no water in the soil. When preparing for alfalfa, we plow well,\r\nlevel the ground, and sow 15 to 20 pounds of seed per acre, and harrow\r\nlightly, or brush it in. Sow as early as the ground can be worked--about\r\nMarch 1. The first crop, if properly handled, will yield from three to\r\nfive tons per acre; it will have more or less sunflowers, which are a\r\nprotection while the plant is getting a start. It seldom winterkills. We\r\nirrigate by flooding the ground twice each season from a stream. After\r\nthe first year, three cuttings are had; 2¹⁄₂ tons per acre the first;\r\n1¹⁄₂ to 2 the second; and one ton per acre the third. Cut for hay as\r\nsoon as well blossomed. It grows too rank here for seed. Hay should cure\r\nin from one to two days, and, if properly cured, stack as other hay.\r\nAlfalfa costs, in stack, $3 per ton. The size of bales is immaterial,\r\nexcept in fitting cars. Prices for hay have ranged from $5 to $10 per\r\nton; for seed, from 7 to 15 cents per pound. It is the best hay in use\r\nfor farm animals. Horses will thrive on it without grain, if properly\r\nhandled. For swine pasture it is far ahead of clover. It is satisfactory\r\nfor sheep. In some localities it will cause cattle to bloat; as a\r\npreventive, feed well with dry hay before turning them on the pasture.\r\nDeep soil is the best for the long life of the plant. The second year it\r\nis at its best, and, if properly handled, and does not winterkill, will\r\nlast for all time. It is much better than Red clover for green manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLINOIS\r\n\r\n_Prof. C. G. Hopkins, Agronomist Illinois experiment station._--Alfalfa\r\nis being introduced into Illinois to a considerable extent. Very careful\r\nand somewhat extensive investigations conducted by the experiment\r\nstation, beginning in 1901, have positively established the fact that\r\nalfalfa can be grown in this state on several of our most abundant types\r\nof soil. As a rule, it is markedly advantageous to thoroughly inoculate\r\nthe soil with alfalfa bacteria, preferably by taking infected soil from\r\na well-established alfalfa field, where root tubercles are found in\r\nabundance or from land where Sweet clover (melilotus), has been growing\r\nsuccessfully for several years. Infected Sweet clover soil serves just\r\nas well as infected alfalfa soil for the inoculation of alfalfa fields.\r\nAs a rule, the best results are secured from summer seeding. The land\r\nshould be thoroughly prepared and made as free from weeds and foul grass\r\nas possible and then seeded between June 15 and August 15, if the\r\nconditions are favorable. Under exceptional conditions good results are\r\nobtained from earlier and later seeding. Three cuttings are usually\r\nobtained in the northern part of the state and four in the southern\r\npart. The average yield is five or six tons per acre. A liberal use of\r\nfarm manure in getting the alfalfa started is advantageous and on some\r\nsoils the application of lime is necessary in order to correct the\r\nacidity of the soil. As a rule, the yield is increased by adding to the\r\nsoil some form of phosphorous. A yield of 8¹⁄₂ tons of thoroughly\r\nair-dry hay has been obtained where a special effort has been made to\r\nmake the conditions favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANA\r\n\r\n_C. M. Ginther, Wayne county_ writes in _Orange Judd Farmer_, July 8,\r\n1905:--“Up to last year there had not been half a dozen attempts to grow\r\nalfalfa in Wayne county, not because there was no desire on the part of\r\nthe farmers to raise the crop, but because the farmers knew absolutely\r\nnothing about the methods to pursue in order to get a fair stand. Last\r\nyear, however, a number of agriculturists in the county determined to\r\ntry the crop. A mile west of Richmond lies the farm of J. H.\r\nHollingsworth, a well-known farmer, whose practical ideas about farming\r\nhave given him a local reputation. He is an advocate of intensive\r\nfarming and cultivates his crops in the most thorough manner. He keeps a\r\nherd of dairy cattle and in his search for more economical food than\r\nmill stuffs and clover hay, he decided to try alfalfa and feed it with a\r\nration of corn meal. He had a tract of five acres. This land was a clay\r\nloam with a good mixture of sand. It was not underdrained, and Mr.\r\nHollingsworth believes the result would have been better had there been\r\na thorough system of underdrainage. The soil is what is known here as\r\nsugar tree land. About May 1 of last year, the tract was plowed\r\nmoderately and then rolled. During the previous winter a heavy\r\ntop-dressing of barnyard manure had been applied to two acres for the\r\npurpose of comparison. One week later the roller was run over it again.\r\nAfter this the ground was thoroughly torn up with a two-horse\r\ncultivator. This was for the purpose of killing the weeds, which had\r\nbeen given time to take a start. After the cultivator had thoroughly\r\ntorn up the ground, the field was harrowed twice both ways. It was then\r\nrolled, and pronounced in first-class condition. The weeds had succumbed\r\nto these repeated attacks and but very few appeared in the crop later.\r\nThis thorough preparation of the ground is absolutely necessary for the\r\nsuccessful starting of alfalfa. It is a fastidious plant, requiring the\r\nmost favorable surroundings in its early life, but gradually grows quite\r\nrobust and strong. Its early weeks seem to be the critical time in its\r\nlife, and if it can once be started well its thrifty nature will assert\r\nitself and it will grow with amazing rapidity. On June 11 the seed was\r\nplanted. It was sown broadcast and harrowed in lightly. One hundred\r\npounds pure alfalfa seed were sown, which was 20 pounds to the acre. The\r\nexperience of many others is that 15 pounds per acre is better. The seed\r\nwas first treated with bacteria, procured from the department of\r\nagriculture at Washington, and when the seeds were thoroughly dry, they\r\nwere planted. Exactly five weeks after the seed was planted, the crop\r\nwas 1 foot high and covered the ground everywhere. On that day it was\r\nclipped first and later given two more clippings during the season. The\r\neffect of the clipping was to cause the crop to become more stalky, and\r\nspread out more over the ground. None of the crop was removed from the\r\nsoil last year, the three clippings being allowed to remain about the\r\nroots as a mulch. This was regarded as highly important and its effect\r\nwas noticeable in the perfect manner in which the crop passed through\r\nthe winter. Early this spring it started to grow and on April 18 the\r\nplants averaged 12 inches high all over the tract. Mr. Hollingsworth is\r\na firm believer in the efficacy of the bacterial treatment of the seed\r\nbefore planting. He attributes the wonderful growth of this crop to the\r\neffect of the organisms produced by inoculation. It is interesting to\r\nnote the effect of the top-dressing which was applied to two acres of\r\nthe tract. The crop on that part of the ground is larger and more\r\nluxuriant than the part that received no dressing. The crop all over the\r\ntract appears vigorous and healthy, but the two acres show a decided\r\nimprovement and superiority.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cutting Alfalfa in Southern California]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bailing Alfalfa in Southern Oklahoma]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =A 400-ton Rick of Alfalfa=\r\n\r\nin Malheur County, southeastern Oregon.

In\r\nfact, some farmers who have taken our advice and tried the crop are now\r\nsaying that they are having all they can do to take care of their crops\r\nof hay. Think of cutting four or even three crops of good hay from the\r\nsame area each season. Isn’t it worth being busy and not going fishing\r\nwhen a farmer can do that? It means an enormous saving in high-priced\r\nland when ten acres will produce as much hay as thirty or more formerly\r\ndid, and hay better in quality also. And then, think of keeping a field\r\nin meadow thirty, forty, or more years and having it growing better each\r\nyear. There is not much necessity for crop rotation under those\r\nconditions, is there? especially when every season means three or four\r\ncrops of good hay. But that is the way with alfalfa and the more farmers\r\nget of it the more they usually want. We are glad so many Indiana\r\nfarmers are getting busy with this crop, and there is no question of its\r\nkeeping them busy if they will only give it a trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nIOWA.\r\n\r\n_Prof M. L. Bowman, Department Farm Crops, Iowa experiment station._--We\r\nare receiving very good results from the alfalfa which is being grown at\r\nthis station, making from three to four cuttings each season with the\r\nyield ranging from 4 to 7 tons to the acre. From one field, seeded in\r\nAugust, 1905, the first cutting was taken June 11, 1906, and yielded\r\n2.17 tons per acre. Two other cuttings were made. We believe alfalfa is\r\nsure to become one of Iowa’s great crops as desirable results are being\r\nobtained in many parts of the state where land is properly seeded. We\r\ntake great pains to see that the ground is in good physical condition\r\nand that the seed is sown in late summer, some time between August 5 and\r\n15, so that the young plants will make sufficient growth to withstand\r\nthe winter. If the seeding takes place in the fall, the alfalfa plants\r\nwill not make sufficient growth to withstand the winter. Alfalfa should\r\nnot be pastured the first season. The growth from seeding time until\r\nwinter sets in should be 6 to 8 inches and should be left on the ground\r\nfor winter protection. A nurse crop should not be used. Alfalfa will not\r\ndo well on low, wet ground, but must have land that is well drained. In\r\nthe northern parts of the state it may be sown in the spring, and in\r\nthis case desirable results have been secured by using a nurse crop. If\r\noats are used at all, they should be an early variety. Wheat or barley\r\nis much better. They are not so likely to lodge. If the nurse crop is\r\nheavy, a poor stand of alfalfa is almost sure to follow. Not more than\r\none-half the usual amount of grain should be sown to the acre. Better\r\nresults may be expected if no nurse crop is used. In this case, it will\r\nbe necessary for the weeds to be mowed down two or three times during\r\nthe summer, so that the alfalfa will not be choked out. It is better to\r\nsow in the spring than late in the fall. Late summer seeding is the\r\nbest. The following year it will be freer from weeds and have a better\r\nstand than that which was sown the spring before. Cornstalk ground which\r\nwas well manured the year before for corn is generally used for spring\r\nseeding. The stalks should first be removed. The field may then be\r\nthoroughly disked and harrowed. The seed should be sown about the middle\r\nof April.\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS.\r\n\r\n_C. D. Perry, Clark county._--In 1887, I sowed 200 acres of alfalfa, and\r\nnow have 270 acres. This is nearly all on second bottom land, with\r\nblack, sandy loam, black sand, and gumbo. The land is largely “made”\r\nland, about 6 to 12 feet of good soil, with gumbo only on top for 12 or\r\n14 inches. On the heavy land the dry soil begins at the top, and, at the\r\nbreaking of the sod, extended down eight or nine feet. Water is found at\r\na depth of 12 to 21 feet. We irrigate most of our crop from the Cimarron\r\nriver. The first time the land is watered it takes from two to five\r\ntimes as much water as is required later, and now we find the best\r\nresults are obtained by watering about 10 days before cutting, using\r\nthree or four inches of water. There is no damage by frost, except on\r\nlow, wet land. Without irrigation, I should double plow the ground\r\nbefore seeding, having one plow follow the other in the same furrow, and\r\ngoing as deep as possible. Seed by drilling one-half to one inch deep,\r\n10 pounds to the acre for seed, 20 pounds for hay, and 30 pounds for\r\npasture, usually about March 15 here. We mow the weeds the first year\r\nbefore they seed, leaving them on the ground. After this, there will be\r\na yield of three-fourths to two tons of hay, or one to six bushels of\r\nseed to the acre, depending on the season. In two or three years the\r\nplant is at its best, and does not seem to need reseeding after that. We\r\nhave from three to five crops a year depending on promptness in\r\nwatering and cutting. Any later cutting is better than the first for\r\nseed, and, before cutting, two-thirds of the seed pods should be black.\r\nWe mow, then rake and cock at once, stacking as soon as well cured. Hay\r\nshould be cut when it is coming into bloom. To make good hay, let it lie\r\nfor half a day (if dry weather), then rake and cock, and let cure\r\nthoroughly. We stack in long ricks, and it keeps well. The alfalfa land\r\nis valued at $50 an acre, and the four irrigations cost 25 cents each;\r\nthe estimated cost of the alfalfa in the stack is $2.15 a ton. An\r\naverage yield of seed is three bushels to the acre, and the cost of\r\nthreshing and cleaning it is 80 cents a bushel. Hay has sold for $5 a\r\nton, and seed for 6, 8 and 10 cents a pound. The threshed hay is not so\r\ngood as that cut earlier, but cattle eat it all clean. The pasture is\r\nexcellent for horses, hogs, and cattle. If the alfalfa is wet, it is\r\nliable to cause bloating with sheep; for cattle, there is not much\r\ndanger, except for the first few days they are turned on. If the animal\r\nis seen in time, it may be relieved by driving around, but if too bad to\r\nbe helped in that way, it needs the trocar. I have had 50 hogs on six\r\nacres of pasture this summer, and have 50 pigs, 3 to 12 weeks old; used\r\ntwo bushels of ground wheat and barley each day, and think I could have\r\nhad as many more hogs on the pasture. The sod is very hard to plow, but\r\nit can be killed. On a piece of hog pasture plowed under, I raised 70\r\nbushels of barley to the acre. My alfalfa seems to do the best on black,\r\nsandy land and on gumbo, with sand or open subsoil below.\r\n\r\n_J. R. Blackshere, Chase county._--I began with alfalfa in 1875, by\r\nsowing 1¹⁄₂ bushels of seed bought in San Francisco, at the rate of $21\r\nper bushel. As the germination was defective, or the seed grown so far\r\naway was not adapted to our soil or climatic conditions, a good stand\r\nwas not at first obtained, but I now have 700 acres on Cottonwood river\r\nbottom land, having a clay subsoil underlaid by a layer of sand 20 feet\r\nbelow, and with a good portion of gumbo, where the best alfalfa grows.\r\nThe soil is not especially moist until water, 20 to 30 feet below, is\r\nreached. My best results have been obtained on corn land, cutting across\r\nthe rows with a disk harrow, leveling with a plank drag, and sowing,\r\nafter danger of freezing is past, 20 pounds of seed per acre with a disk\r\nhaving seeder attachment, being sure to have all the seed covered. I cut\r\nthe weeds off with a mower, and leave them on the ground. After the\r\nfirst year my average product annually for 10 or 12 years has been about\r\nfive tons per acre. That permitted to ripen seed yields three to five\r\nbushels per acre. I do not irrigate. The plant will thrive on upland\r\nhaving a clay subsoil without a stratum of hardpan. Grazed closely late\r\nin the fall, it is liable to die out in a dry winter.\r\n\r\n_Benj. Brown, Osborne county._--I have had four years’ experience with\r\nalfalfa growing in this country, and have also grown it in England,\r\nwithout any irrigation, and now have 45 acres. The land is bottom rising\r\nto second bottom, with vegetable loam and some gumbo in the upper\r\nportion, and loam subsoil, similar to surface, but somewhat paler, for\r\n15 feet down. Well water is found by digging 11 to 22 feet through the\r\nsoil, which is usually moist except in dry weather, when the upper two\r\nor three feet are not. It has been found best to plow six inches deep,\r\nin August or September; to roll or level with a heavy float about April\r\n15, then harrow, and broadcast 25 pounds (or drill 20 pounds) of seed to\r\nthe acre. I broadcast all of mine, and harrow and roll or level. The\r\nbest time for sowing here is April 14 to 30, as it almost invariably\r\nrains here about April 20, and frosts have never hurt my crop, nor does\r\nit winterkill. Mow first when the weeds are six to nine inches high,\r\nand, if worth hauling, stack; if not, let lie; generally mow again about\r\nJuly 4 to 20, and stack; there may be one-fourth to one-half ton of hay\r\nper acre. The second season we cut three times, unless we ripen seed,\r\nand obtain from one-fourth to one ton each cutting; after this it grows\r\nabout a foot high by October. For hay, mow as soon as about half full of\r\nflowers, rake the same morning, and haul in one or two days, as the\r\nleaves fall if dry. It does not heat nor mold here if the sap is half\r\nout and the straw long; I use the “Acme” hay harvester, making stacks\r\nwith rounded ends, nine steps long by five wide, and top out with straw\r\nor hay, taking care to keep the middle well filled. The total cost of\r\nhay in stack is about $1.50 per ton, the land being valued at $15 per\r\nacre, or $60 with a good stand of alfalfa. The hay has sold for $4 to $6\r\nper ton during the past four years. The best crop for seed depends on\r\nthe weather; sometimes the first flowers set best, and again the later\r\nones do better; on my bottom land the plant grows too large for seed,\r\nunless in a dry time. If seed is ripe, cut only while damp or in the\r\nearly morning, rake into rows immediately or early the next morning,\r\nhaul with a “Monarch” rake, and use a stacker. Last year and year\r\nbefore I obtained four bushels of seed to the acre, and it cost me 60\r\ncents per bushel for cleaning. Used ordinary threshing outfit, and set\r\nhind end of thresher 10 inches lower than front. The seed has sold here\r\nduring four years for $5 to $8 per bushel. Horses and sheep should not\r\nbe pastured on the alfalfa, as it pays to mow and haul it to them,\r\neither green or dry. It makes good pasturage for cattle, but they must\r\nnot be turned on when the ground is frozen, nor when they are hungry, as\r\nit is necessary to start them gradually to avoid bloating. Mine never\r\nhave bloated, and I feed milch cows in the early spring and on the\r\nfourth crop in the fall. Alfalfa ripened and threshed has little value,\r\nas it breaks up into dust and chaff. My stand improved every year; was\r\nabout at its best the sixth year, and continues about the same for an\r\nindefinite time. If it gets a fair start, and is cut three times, a good\r\nstand can be kept; but if it is pastured, and the weeds are not eaten,\r\nit is apt to thin itself. A neighbor plowed under alfalfa for green\r\nmanure, but the next year it grew up as thick and strong as if not\r\nplowed. We do not need manure here. I have seen several pieces of fairly\r\ngood alfalfa on high prairie, with some gumbo in the soil, but it grows\r\nbest where the subsoil is fairly open. Upland is generally best for\r\nseed, as the plants should grow only one to two feet high, and mine on\r\nthe bottom grows 2 to 3¹⁄₂ after the second year. I think there is no\r\nother crop here to compare with alfalfa. My third year’s crop cleared me\r\nover $20 per acre. I have known of nine bushels of seed on one acre, and\r\nhave heard of 15 in this county. My bottom lands will grow three good\r\ncrops of hay almost without rain, and kill out all the weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY\r\n\r\n_Prof. H. Garman, Botanist Kentucky experiment station._--We have grown\r\nalfalfa on the experiment farm for a good many years and have been\r\nimpressed with its many good qualities, although we have not found it as\r\nwell adapted to our soil and climate as it appears to be in the western\r\nstates. In our small experimental plots, on good soil, it has recently\r\ndone remarkably well. This is partly the result of understanding it\r\nbetter than formerly, and partly due to the care which these plots\r\nreceive. Last year we harvested, from some of them, hay at the rate of\r\nfrom 6.32 to 10.03 tons per acre. The same plots are yielding very well\r\nthis season, but I think will not produce quite as much hay as last\r\nyear, though they look very well at present. Farmers in this state are\r\nbecoming interested in alfalfa, stimulated by the reports made to them\r\nat farmers’ institutes, and urged by failure to grow Red clover\r\nsuccessfully in some parts of the state. But thus far they have not met\r\nwith uniform success. Part of this is due to a lack of acquaintance with\r\nthe plant and part may be attributed to our climate. A few men have been\r\ngrowing alfalfa successfully for eight or 10 years, and I can see no\r\nreason why many others should not succeed with it. The chief difficulty\r\nappears to come in getting a start. Alfalfa, thoroughly started, holds\r\nits own better than Red clover and yields much more forage. The value of\r\nthe forage is recognized by everybody, and I expect to see in the course\r\nof the next quarter of a century a much larger acreage sown in\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA.\r\n\r\n_Prof. W. R. Dodson, Director Louisiana experiment station._--Alfalfa\r\nhas been grown by the Louisiana stations since 1887. At the time the\r\nstations were established there was little or no alfalfa grown in the\r\nstate. From the very first experiments conducted by Dr. W. C. Stubbs, it\r\nwas apparent that the plant was well suited to the alluvial lands of the\r\nMississippi and Red rivers. Dr. Stubbs never lost an opportunity to\r\nadvocate its culture, and the great progress made in securing its\r\nextensive cultivation is largely due to his efforts. Alfalfa is now\r\nextensively grown in the Red river bottoms, and a very large percentage\r\nof the sugar planters grow it for soiling and for hay for the plantation\r\nmules. We get from four to seven cuttings per year. The average is about\r\n1¹⁄₂ tons for the first three cuttings, but less for the last cuttings.\r\nThe station one year secured a harvest of 12 tons of cured hay per acre;\r\nsix tons in a season is a good yield. Were it not that one or more of\r\nthese cuttings will fall due during a rainy season, when it is difficult\r\nto cure hay, we would go into the business very extensively in this\r\nstate. As to the quality of the hay or forage, there is no question\r\nabout its place at the head of the list of desirable forage crops. The\r\nsugar planters find it especially desirable to mix with their cheap\r\nmolasses, as the former is rich in protein and the latter rich in\r\ncarbohydrates. In the southern portion of the state best results are\r\nsecured by planting in the fall. In the northern portion good results\r\nare secured from early spring planting. We use from 25 to 30 pounds of\r\nseed to the acre. Some planters use more than this. Land that is least\r\nsuited for growing corn in Louisiana, because of its stiffness, is the\r\nvery best land for alfalfa. Where the crop has once been used and the\r\nlocal supply runs short, it is shipped in from Colorado to supply the\r\ndemand. It is selling now for $15 a ton. No better testimonial need be\r\ngiven of the people’s estimate of its value.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n_Prof. William P. Brooks, Director Hatch experiment station._--Our\r\nexperiments with alfalfa have been continued both upon our own grounds\r\nand those of a few selected farms in different parts of the state. We\r\nare bringing to bear upon these experiments information in regard to\r\nsuccessful methods from every possible source. We find in all cases a\r\ndistinct benefit from a heavy initial application of lime. We have used\r\nfrom 2,000 to 3,000 pounds per acre. We are enriching soils already\r\nnaturally good by heavy applications both of manures and fertilizers,\r\nusing materials which experience has proved best. We are also giving the\r\nsoil a most thorough preparatory tillage. It has usually been\r\nfall-plowed, and in addition it is plowed in the spring, and repeatedly\r\nharrowed to destroy weeds which start in the early part of the season.\r\nWe have tried inoculating the soil, both with earth obtained from a\r\nfield in New York, where alfalfa is successfully grown and with the\r\ncultures sent out by the department of agriculture and prepared by\r\nprivate firms. We have not attained such degree of success as justifies\r\nus in recommending the crop. We have occasionally got a fair stand of\r\nalfalfa, but in all cases the winters prove more or less injurious. In\r\nthe course of a few years the alfalfa is mostly crowded out by grasses\r\nand clovers. The alfalfa almost every year suffers from leaf spot, which\r\ntends to cut down the yield. We have found a very distinct benefit from\r\nthe inoculation with earth from the New York alfalfa field. We have not\r\nfound an equally distinct benefit to follow inoculation with any of the\r\ncultures; and, although we are not as yet ready to make a final report,\r\nit should be here remarked that the most careful experiments on the use\r\nof these cultures in sterilized soils, under conditions calculated to\r\ngive accurate results, indicate that they have little, if any, value. In\r\nour various experiments alfalfa has been tried on a wide variety of\r\nsoils. We have had a quarter of an acre field upon a coarse-textured\r\nsoil upon a farm in this neighborhood where there is never any standing\r\nwater within 50 to 60 feet of the surface. Even on this soil the\r\nalfalfa, although it did fairly well for a year, has been injured by\r\nsuccessive winters, until it is at the present time almost ruined. In\r\nthis connection I call attention further to the fact that D. S. Bliss of\r\nthe department of agriculture, who has been making special efforts to\r\npromote the introduction of alfalfa into New England, and who has\r\ntraveled extensively for the purpose of studying the results obtained,\r\nnow speaks very discouragingly as to the outlook in general. In\r\nconclusion, while we are not inclined to discourage experiments with\r\nalfalfa, we do wish most emphatically to caution against engaging in\r\nthese experiments upon an extended scale, for we feel that\r\ndisappointment is almost inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHIGAN\r\n\r\n_Prof. C. D. Smith, Director Michigan experiment station._--Alfalfa has\r\nhad and is having a checkered career. Under favorable conditions it\r\nmakes a good stand. Some fields have produced crops for many years, the\r\nground being occasionally fertilized by manurial salts. The difficulties\r\nthat environ the crop are: (1) The severe winters, which sometimes kill\r\noff whole fields, leaving scarcely a root alive; this has happened to\r\nfields two, three, or four years old. (2) The Blue grass crowds it out\r\nbadly; (3) the ignorance of the farmers in regard to the requirements of\r\nthe crop and the consequent imperfect preparation of the soil in the\r\nmatter of tillage or fertilization, has made it difficult to introduce\r\nit in a broad way. Notwithstanding these difficulties and the farther\r\nconsideration that alfalfa does not easily lend itself to a short\r\nrotation, the crop is advancing in the state by leaps and bounds.\r\nHundreds of farmers are experimenting with it and are learning how to\r\nprepare the ground, sow it and care for the crop afterwards. Statistics\r\nare not at hand to show how many acres of alfalfa there are in the\r\nstate, nor can definite figures be given as to the growth of interest in\r\nthe crop and its actual acreage. When proper strains have been\r\ndeveloped, it seems fair to presume that alfalfa will be one of the\r\nstaple crops in Michigan. On the station grounds at the agricultural\r\ncollege fields of alfalfa have been continuously maintained from 1897 to\r\n1904. There are fields here sown in 1903 bearing their three crops each\r\nyear, yielding from 5 to 7 tons of dry hay annually per acre. There has\r\nbeen some difficulty in getting pure and vigorous seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA\r\n\r\n_Prof. W. M. Liggett, Director Minnesota experiment station._--Our\r\nexperience with alfalfa has extended over 12 or 15 years. In the early\r\ndays of this station, it was not very successfully grown. During the\r\npast eight or ten years, however, the changes in soil due to manures and\r\ncultivation and the discovery of several varieties of alfalfa which\r\nappear to be hardy, have made it possible to grow it successfully in\r\nnearly every part of the state. For the past five years we have cut\r\nthree crops of alfalfa hay, yielding from 4 to 5¹⁄₂ tons per acre each\r\nyear. With the land properly prepared and some attention given to\r\nseeding at the right time, there is no difficulty in growing it on the\r\nstate farm. Occasionally it will winterkill. We were unfortunate enough\r\nto have a heavy, driving rain during March of the present year which\r\nfroze as it fell and smothered the alfalfa crop. We are not discouraged,\r\nhowever, as the clover crop in southeastern Minnesota was killed at the\r\nsame time and from the same cause. We regard alfalfa just as sure as Red\r\nclover. It is sometimes a little difficult to get a stand under careless\r\nmethods of farming. With the land nicely prepared and with a good supply\r\nof humus in such condition that the plant food is readily available,\r\nstrong, vigorous growth and a good stand can be secured during any\r\nnormal year. We have alfalfa growing at the northwest sub-station at\r\nCrookston, and in several localities in the northwestern part of the\r\nstate, where even clover is not supposed to grow. The outlook at the\r\npresent time for this crop is very bright. Dairymen, swine raisers and\r\nsheep men unite in praising its merits as stock food.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSOURI\r\n\r\n_Prof. M. F. Miller, Agronomist, Missouri experiment station._--Alfalfa\r\nis being grown with success on various types of soil, although many\r\nsoils are not well adapted to its growth. A knowledge of the\r\npeculiarities of the plant will ultimately make it possible to extend\r\nIts culture to most soil types of the state. Liberal manuring is the key\r\nto successful culture on upland soils. The manure may be applied before\r\nplowing and also as frequent top-dressings. The value of the crop as a\r\nfeed and its high yield, where favorable conditions are supplied, make\r\nit a particularly desirable one to grow, at least in small areas, on\r\nfarms where mixed fanning or dairy farming is practiced. While alfalfa\r\nmakes a most nutritious pasture crop, it does not lend itself well to\r\npasturing unless certain precautions are taken. Where it is grown for\r\nhay, difficulty is often experienced in harvesting the first, and\r\nsometimes other cuttings, on account of wet weather. The silo may be\r\nused in such cases. The stiff subsoils of the state are responsible for\r\nmost failures reported, because it requires some knowledge of the\r\nmethods of handling the crop to make it succeed under such conditions.\r\nAlfalfa is not adapted to our soils, liming, manuring or drainage being\r\nnecessary to prepare such for the crop. If sown on upland soils that\r\nhave never grown alfalfa or Sweet clover, it is benefited by\r\ninoculation. On bottom lands or lands that are very fertile, inoculation\r\nhas little or no effect. The surest and often the simplest means of\r\ninoculation is by means of inoculated soil. The cultures prepared for\r\nseed inoculation have in many cases given excellent results, but they\r\nare still in the experimental stage and some skill is required to\r\nhandle them properly. The best preparation of the seedbed is that which\r\nallows of an early plowing and the use of a harrow every time a crust\r\nforms or weeds start before time to sow the seed. The seedbed should be\r\nmuch like that for wheat--loose above but firm below. The best time to\r\nsow in this state is between the middle of August and the middle of\r\nSeptember, the last week in August usually giving best results. The\r\namount of seed to sow is between 15 and 20 pounds, depending upon the\r\nquality and the character of the soil. It is best sown without a nurse\r\ncrop. It must be clipped frequently the first and sometimes the second\r\nseason, especially on soils to which it is not well adapted. It should\r\nusually be cut when the lower leaves begin to turn yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTANA\r\n\r\n_Alfred Rasicot, Deer Lodge county._--Alfalfa is the most valuable crop\r\nthat is raised in Idaho or Utah for hay, growing on any kind of land but\r\nthat which is low and wet, yielding five to seven tons of hay to the\r\nacre, and providing excellent feed for all kinds of farm animals. For\r\nabout 20 years I have grown from 20 to 50 acres on second bottom and\r\nupland of heavy clay soil, with gravel below and water at a depth\r\nvarying from 16 to 100 feet on different localities. We irrigate from\r\nstreams, flooding the land and turning the water off as soon as the land\r\nhas been all covered, applying once for the first cutting and twice for\r\neach succeeding cutting, whenever the ground is dry. The first year on\r\nnew land requires fully one-third more water than is needed afterward.\r\nBefore seeding, the ground should be mellow, then harrowed with the\r\nback part of the harrow or brushed, and seeded with 15 to 20 pounds to\r\nthe acre, between the first and middle of April. The plant will usually\r\nrun out the weeds, and on that account no special treatment is needed.\r\nThe first season will produce a small crop of hay, but no good seed.\r\nUnless water is allowed to freeze on the land, alfalfa does not\r\nwinterkill here, and at two or three years of age it is at its best,\r\ncontinuing vigorous for 10, 20 or 30 years without seeding. The first\r\ncutting of the season yields about 2¹⁄₂ to 3 tons to the acre, the\r\nsecond about 2 to 2¹⁄₂, and the third 1 to 1¹⁄₂ tons. The hay is cut\r\nwhen the plant has been in bloom 8 or 10 days, allowed to lie for 24 to\r\n36 hours, and treated as Red clover is. The second crop is always the\r\nbest for seed here. The cost in the stack, on $25 land, irrigation\r\ncosting 50 to 75 cents an acre, is $2 a ton. To put this into 100-pound\r\nbales costs $2.50 a ton. On the ground it sells for $3 to $5 a ton,\r\nwhile the seed brings $3, $4 and $5 a bushel. An ordinary yield of seed\r\nis 300 pounds to the acre, and this is threshed with the same machine\r\nused for grain, at a cost of about one-fourth of the seed. The straw is\r\nworth about one-fourth as much as the hay. We consider alfalfa hay, for\r\ncattle, sheep, and hogs, far superior to clover, but for horses timothy\r\nis best. It will keep steers and sheep fat all winter, providing they\r\nare under shelter, and is excellent for milch cows. The pasture for\r\nswine and cattle is far better than clover, and for work horses and\r\nsheep it is good, but not the best for horses that are driven fast.\r\nCattle will bloat about as they do on Red clover when turned onto it\r\nafter rain, dew, or frost. To rid land of a stand of alfalfa is very\r\ndifficult, requiring four stout horses with a very sharp plow to turn it\r\nover, but as a green manure it has about the same effect as Red clover,\r\nproducing two or three extra crops afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA\r\n\r\n_Olmstead & Olmstead, Furnas county._--Alfalfa, while excellent for all\r\nother stock, is preeminently the feed for hogs. Its early appearance,\r\nits wonderfully rapid growth, its nutritious properties, its perennial\r\nnature (keeping green until about December), its resistance to drouth,\r\nits wonderful fecundity, and, lastly, its adaptability as a dry feed,\r\nmake it, in our opinion, the most profitable crop that can be grown. Ten\r\nacres of alfalfa will pasture 150 head of hogs, and give them abundance.\r\nFrom the 15th of March, or at most not later than the 15th of April,\r\nhogs and cattle can be turned on pasture, and kept there until snow\r\nflies. On first bottoms, six tons per acre can be depended upon as a\r\nfair, average yield, while many fields this year have made as high as\r\neight. On divide, or high land, where it has been tested for three\r\nyears, it averages about two to four tons per acre, but this land gives\r\nthe best returns for seed, not growing too rank. Since we have been\r\ninvestigating and gathering information on this subject, we have had\r\nreported to us a yield as high as eight bushels of seed per acre, and\r\nquite a number as high as nine, and some eleven. Six bushels an acre on\r\na good stand is an average yield, while some will fall below that. The\r\nseed has never sold here below $4 per bushel. Last year and this, all\r\nseed grown in this part of the country sold readily at $5 per bushel,\r\nand for the next five years will probably not go lower than $3. One crop\r\nof seed and two of hay are the average on low land, and one crop less of\r\nhay on high land. The threshed hay is nearly as good for feed as the\r\nunthreshed. There is no waste in feeding this hay, and horses are\r\nespecially fond of the coarse stems. It stands our winters remarkably\r\nwell, so far, coming through in excellent condition. There is no stock\r\nbut eats alfalfa hay as well or better than clover or timothy. Young\r\ncolts and calves will winter in fine condition on this hay, with little\r\nor no grain. If the last cutting is allowed to stand, with a growth from\r\nsix to eight inches, horses and cattle will graze on it through the\r\nwinter, the same as on Red clover, doing equally as well. Now, as to the\r\nother side. Will this clover grow in all latitudes and longitudes as\r\nwell as Red clover? We think it doubtful. It requires a dry, porous\r\nsoil, in which there is no hardpan nor too much clay, and it does not\r\nlike too much water. It does well where the soil is somewhat sandy, its\r\nroots penetrating to a depth of from 15 to 25 feet, thus drawing its\r\nnutrition from various strata of soil. What else against it? If cattle\r\nare turned on after a rain, when it is wet, or dew is on, they often\r\nbloat and die; but if turned on in the spring, and kept on continuously,\r\nhave little danger of gorging themselves or bloating. No other stock is\r\nadversely affected by it. This is all that can be honestly said against\r\nalfalfa, and this is obviated by a little care by the farmer, while the\r\nmany good things said about it must certainly recommend it to the\r\nintelligent husbandman. Thus we can enumerate: First, its certainty as a\r\ncrop; second, its enormous yield; third, its excellent pasturage\r\nqualities; fourth, its nutritious qualities, being equally good green or\r\ndry; fifth, its yield and price of seed, which is threshed with an\r\nordinary grain separator; sixth, its tremendously rapid growth during\r\nthe summer season. There are many more attributes that can be credited\r\nto alfalfa.\r\n\r\n_W. O. Thompson, Lincoln county._--I have had 20 years’ experience with\r\nalfalfa, on second bottom and upland. The upland has a clay subsoil; the\r\nsecond bottom soil is three feet deep, underlaid with a bed of sand and\r\ngravel. Abundant water is found from 8 to 23 feet from the surface. If\r\ndry soil is found, it is the first three feet below the surface. Land\r\nshould be tilled several years before seeding, in order to perfectly\r\nsubdue the sod. Use about 16 pounds of seed per acre, and prepare the\r\nground the same as for wheat, sowing in the spring. The first crop will\r\nbe nearly all weeds; cut and haul these off the ground. The second crop\r\nwill produce about one ton of hay per acre. Alfalfa is liable to\r\nwinterkill if the winter is warm and dry. I irrigate from a stream two\r\nor three times during the season, with sufficient water to flood all the\r\nground. The first year the ground is soft and porous, and twice the\r\nwater is required as in the following years. From three to four crops\r\nare raised during the season, yielding from 1¹⁄₂ to 2 tons each cutting,\r\nor from five to six tons per acre in one season. Cut when in bloom for\r\nhay, and let the seed ripen before cutting for seed, using either the\r\nfirst or second crop for this seed. When cutting for seed, it should be\r\npitched out of the way of the mower after each round; then let it dry\r\nbefore stacking, but not enough for the leaves to fall off when\r\nhandled. Stack in the ordinary way, but be sure the hay is thoroughly\r\ndry in the shock before stacking. It is more liable to get moldy in the\r\nbarn than in the stack. About $2 per ton will cover all expenses of\r\nraising, on land worth $50 per acre. The expense of baling is about\r\n$1.50 per ton, 100-pound bales being preferred. It should not be baled\r\nuntil perfectly dry in the stack. About six bushels per acre is the\r\naverage yield of seed, and it costs about 75 cents per bushel to thresh\r\nand clean. A clover huller is the most satisfactory for threshing\r\nalfalfa. The hay has sold here at $3 to $10 per ton, averaging $6. The\r\nseed has brought from $3 to $10 per bushel averaging $5. One acre of\r\nalfalfa will raise 35 hogs, with the aid of a little grain. Horses\r\nthrive on it, but it is unsafe for sheep and cattle. Animals which chew\r\nthe cud will bloat if pastured on alfalfa. The only way to prevent it is\r\nto keep them from the pasture. The best way to cure it is to insert a\r\ntube into the paunch, to allow the gas to escape. As to the longevity of\r\nthe plant, I call to mind a patch sown in 1873, on upland, and it is\r\nstill growing. Alfalfa attains its best growth in about two years. I do\r\nnot think it can be profitably raised on high, arid ground, without\r\nirrigation. Hogs can be wintered on alfalfa hay and a very little grain,\r\nand cattle can be fattened for the home market, but it produces softer\r\nflesh, and they could not be shipped a great distance in the best\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n_Richard Stolley, Hall county._--In reading the farm papers I see many\r\narticles about seeding alfalfa, but have failed to see anything in the\r\nline of advice regarding a sure way to kill it, if it has to be done. We\r\nhave had alfalfa on our place as long as I can remember--nearly thirty\r\nyears. At first it was a small piece, just for experiment’s sake.\r\nFinally we sowed about nine acres on good soil and had it well manured\r\nbefore sowing. The result was immense crops, as high as four cuttings;\r\nand, really, the worst feature was to harvest the crop so often, since\r\nit came just as regularly as clock-work. It actually stood in the way of\r\nalfalfa, for I asked one of our neighbors, who had very little hay, why\r\nhe did not sow alfalfa, and all he could answer was: “Well, I have to\r\nharvest it too often and I haven’t the time to do it.”\r\n\r\nWe did not sow more of it until we got more improved methods of handling\r\nit, and we have had as high as fifty to sixty acres on a 160-acre farm\r\nhere at home. Some fields run out in about ten years. Our plan is to\r\nthen plow it up. The first thing you learn is to have a very sharp plow,\r\nand it must have a strong cutter bolted to the share, being long enough\r\nto reach well through the sod. Then if you have three good horses you\r\nare fixed out. A riding plow that we tried was thrown out too easily or\r\npulled too hard. Others had the same experience, and the old reliable\r\nfourteen or sixteen-inch walking plow fills the bill best. We plowed\r\nsome of it quite early in the spring and after harvesting the oats we\r\nhad a wonderful stand on the field in the fall. All the inconvenience\r\nthe clover had was to take a little time to start work at the crown and\r\nstart sprout at the other end; that is the root end.\r\n\r\nI do not know of any other plant that is not a weed that has this\r\npeculiarity. Planting corn on alfalfa sod cannot work well, because the\r\nroots are so tough that no cultivator will be able to cut them, and\r\nsince burning does not make any difference, it only has a tendency to\r\nstart roots and sprouts at both ends at the same time. This is, of\r\ncourse, only possible in a wet year. Now, we tried late plowing in the\r\nspring; that is, let the clover get up to about six or eight inches. We\r\nhad a chain on the plow and disked and harrowed it well, and to kill it\r\nsure, put in millet to smother it. We intended to raise seed from the\r\nmillet, but the crop got too heavy and we cut it for hay. After putting\r\nit up I saw very little alfalfa signs and went home contented that all\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nSome nice rains came on and soon I noticed from our house, since I did\r\nnot go to that corner of the farm in between, that all of it was green\r\nagain, and sure enough, there was a comparatively good stand and the\r\nsprouts showed quite a bit of vigor. This surprised me. I had no time to\r\nplow right away and having a large harvest of bottom hay, I did not go\r\nto the field for three weeks, and when I saw it again it was just about\r\nready to cut. I actually did cut and harvest it and it was well worth\r\nthe time it took us to do the work. The next plowing and disking, of\r\ncourse, thinned it out, and especially as dry weather came just right to\r\nassist in killing it.\r\n\r\nAll this made it clear to my mind that we did not find the right time to\r\nplow alfalfa, so the next time I tried it still later; in fact, it was\r\nalmost in bloom, and, being a wet year, there was little difference in\r\nthe result. This year I waited the second time for the alfalfa to come\r\nup a foot high before plowing it back and drilled in sweet corn, and now\r\nI can hardly see any difference on parts of the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\r\n_Prof. Frederick W. Taylor, Agriculturist New Hampshire experiment\r\nstation._--We have tried to secure a stand of alfalfa for four\r\nconsecutive seasons, but so far our efforts have been unsuccessful.\r\nVarious types of soil, from a heavy boulder clay to a light sandy loam,\r\nhave been tried, and, contrary to our expectations, the most promising\r\ncrop was on the heavy clay soil. Our chief difficulty has been in having\r\nthe alfalfa keep ahead of the weeds and in getting a uniform catch that\r\nwould withstand our winters. From one-fourth to one-half of the plants\r\nhave usually wintered over in good condition and made a vigorous growth\r\nthe next season, but there has not been enough of them to say that we\r\nhave made a success with alfalfa. We have largely eliminated the seed\r\nquestion by plowing the ground early and keeping it harrowed until about\r\nthe middle of July, when it is sown. Our experience seems to indicate\r\nthat an application of lime is beneficial, if not absolutely necessary,\r\nin this section and we have accordingly been using it at the rate of a\r\nton to the acre. We have also tried inoculation with the various\r\ncultures, but in no case have any benefits been observed. So far as we\r\nknow, there have been no successful attempts to grow alfalfa on a medium\r\nor large scale in this state, although several farmers in the\r\nConnecticut river valley have reported success on some areas of an acre\r\nor less. When we more thoroughly understand the plant, and the\r\nconditions necessary for its growth, we believe it can be grown upon\r\nsome of our soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY\r\n\r\n_Dr. E. B. Voorhees, Director New Jersey experiment station._--The\r\nfarmers of the state have manifested much interest in the growing of\r\nalfalfa, and many experimental plots have been seeded in the past two or\r\nthree years. In order to obtain accurate information as to the methods\r\nemployed, and the results obtained, a circular letter was sent out\r\nduring the past summer to 140 growers. Detailed replies were obtained\r\nfrom 101 growers. Of these there were 57 distributed over 15 counties,\r\nwhich showed the successful establishment of the crop. The soils upon\r\nwhich these successful crops are growing vary widely, both in their\r\nphysical and chemical character, ranging from a light, sandy loam, with\r\nsandy subsoil, to a medium heavy clay, with compact clay subsoil, which\r\nindicates clearly that success does not depend so much upon the\r\ncharacter of the soil as upon the methods of seeding, fertilization and\r\nafter-treatment, though the most successful stands were, as a rule,\r\nobtained upon sandy soils, overlying a reasonably open subsoil.\r\nTwenty-seven growers had a more or less satisfactory experience, while\r\n17 were absolute failures. A study of the reports of failures shows that\r\nin most instances they were due to lack of observation of the methods\r\nrecommended for the seeding and care of the crop, which experience at\r\nthe station showed to be essential for success. In most cases the land\r\nwas imperfectly prepared; in many an insufficient amount of fertilizer\r\nor manure was applied. In many cases, too little seed was used; in\r\nothers the date of seeding was contrary to all recommendations, or the\r\ncrop was not clipped often, and thus choked out by weeds. In many\r\ninstances, where lime had not been used for many years, none was applied\r\nat the time of seeding. In the case of those having more or less\r\nsuccess, the recommendations were not fully observed or soil conditions\r\nwere imperfect.\r\n\r\n_D. C. Lewis of Middlesex county_, in the summer of 1903 seeded about\r\n1¹⁄₄ acres with alfalfa, observing closely all of the recommendations of\r\nthe experiment station in reference to seeding, but did not inoculate\r\nthe soil. The seed germinated well, and the crop grew nicely during the\r\nfall, but entirely disappeared later. In 1904, the same area, after an\r\noat crop was grown, was seeded again, on August 10. The soil is a clay\r\nloam, with a clay subsoil, and in a good state of fertility. The land\r\nhad been previously in grass and corn. The corn was manured and the\r\nalfalfa area well limed previous to seeding in 1903. The seed was at the\r\nrate of about 25 pounds, and at time of seeding 800 pounds of Mapes’\r\nfertilizer and an extra bag of high-grade sulphate of potash were\r\napplied, and the field was inoculated with about 300 pounds of soil,\r\ntaken from the old alfalfa patch at the experiment station. The seed\r\ngerminated well, and made a rapid and large fall growth and passed the\r\nwinter successfully. The yield per acre was about three tons of hay for\r\nthe first cutting. This experiment is strikingly suggestive in showing\r\nthe importance of soil inoculation, for while inoculation is not\r\napparently essential in all cases, it would seem that where soils have\r\nnot been heavily manured that this point should be carefully observed.\r\n\r\n_J. P. Nelson of Monmouth county_ has had a very successful experience\r\nin the growth of alfalfa, since he has observed all of the\r\nrecommendations made as to methods of seeding and after-treatment. The\r\nfollowing is a description of his method and the results obtained from a\r\nseeding made August 10, 1904. The surface soil is a medium clay loam,\r\nunderlaid with a gravelly clay subsoil. The crops preceding were grass\r\nand corn, and the manures used were barnyard manure and 600 pounds per\r\nacre of ground bone. The corn preceding the alfalfa was limed at the\r\nrate of 1,000 pounds per acre, and 1,400 pounds per acre were applied\r\njust previous to the seeding of alfalfa. Thirty pounds of seed were used\r\nper acre, and lightly harrowed in and the land rolled. The germination\r\nand early growth were good, and the first crop was harvested June 1,\r\n1905. The yield was two big, two-horse loads of cured hay per acre.\r\n\r\n_E. T. Gill of Camden county_ has a sandy loam, underlaid by a subsoil\r\nvarying from sand to clay. He has an area of 24 acres, ranging from two\r\nto six years in age. The first seeding of about two acres is still\r\ngrowing profitable crops, though not uniform in stand. The later\r\nseedings show an excellent stand and large and profitable crops are\r\nannually harvested. Usually four cuts are made each year, which are used\r\nboth for soiling and for hay, with splendid results. The practice on\r\nthis farm is to top-dress with manure during the winter at the rate of\r\nabout eight tons per acre. Mr. Gill’s experience leads him to believe\r\nthat the stand is often injured, particularly during the first year, by\r\nallowing the crop to reach too great maturity and then cutting when the\r\nplants are just beginning to bloom, and leaving a stubble of at least\r\nthree inches. Mr. Gill did not inoculate the seed or soil at his first\r\nseeding, but did follow this practice with recent seedings, and believes\r\nit to be a wise precaution, especially on soils that have not been\r\npreviously heavily manured.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO\r\n\r\n_Thomas J. Clark, Grant county._--I have had 15 years’ experience with\r\nalfalfa on first and second bottom land with gravel soil, dry to within\r\nfour feet of water, which is reached at a depth of 15 feet. I irrigate\r\nfrom the Gila river, and my alfalfa, which is 14 years old, is as good\r\nto-day as at any time since it was sown. The seed is sown as turnip seed\r\nis. I plow the land thoroughly, harrow it over smoothly, then sow the\r\nseed in March, and harrow lightly once. Then the water is turned on, and\r\nthe ground will remain moist until the seeds sprout. After the alfalfa\r\nis six inches high, I cut it to make it spread and destroy all the large\r\nweeds; and there may be two cuttings of hay that same season. Water will\r\nnot injure the plant unless it stands on it in low places. Stagnant\r\nwater standing on the plant, or mineral water so near the surface that\r\nthe roots reach it, will kill the plant, but it is not liable to injury\r\nfrom winter frost. After the first season there are three or four crops,\r\nthe first being usually chosen for seed and not irrigated. For hay it is\r\ncut when in full bloom, and, if the sun is shining, should cure 24 hours\r\nif in June, or 20 in July or August, before raking, and then 30 hours in\r\nthe cock. It must be thoroughly cured before stacking, and then will\r\nnot mold. The most convenient bales weigh 90 to 100 pounds, and the\r\ncost of preparing them is $2 a ton. The total cost of hay in the stack\r\nis about $3 a ton, and the average yield about three tons to the acre\r\neach year. When the burs turn brown the seed is harvested, and when well\r\ncured should be stacked in a dry place. An average yield is 500 to 600\r\npounds to the acre, and it sells for $4 a bushel. The hay makes\r\nexcellent feed for farm animals, keeping them in good condition the year\r\naround without grain. The alfalfa pasturage is better for swine and\r\ncattle than clover, and yields more largely; sheep may be kept on it to\r\nadvantage also. A good acre will keep five grown hogs in excellent\r\ncondition, but will not make them fat. If they are taken up in October\r\nand fed about 40 days on grain, they will be marketable. Cattle on the\r\npasture sometimes bloat, but I have had 100 head of cows and calves on\r\nmine for two months, and have had no trouble. The irrigated alfalfa is\r\nbetter than that grown on land that requires no water. The straw is\r\nabout equal to oat straw, but not half so good as the alfalfa hay. To\r\nrid land of the plant requires a strong team and a sharp 10-inch plow.\r\nThe roots rot at once after plowing, and the land is well fertilized for\r\nother crops. In my opinion, alfalfa is the best forage plant known in\r\nthis western country. It is most easily raised, produces the largest\r\nyield, commands the best price, and can be planted at any time from\r\nMarch to September. Land seeded to it is the most valuable, and the\r\nfarmer who has plenty of it is the most prosperous. Farming here cannot\r\nbe a success without it, and I take pleasure in recommending it to my\r\nbrother farmers. It will lie dormant all summer if it is dry, and with\r\nfall rains revive and make good pasture. It is the earliest plant up in\r\nthe spring, and the last to stay green in the fall. In other words, it\r\nis the best of all.\r\n\r\n_Hartman & Weil, San Miguel county._--We have been dealers in alfalfa\r\nhay for eight years, and have some small fields of our own. This is on\r\nboth bottom and upland. In the bottom, the subsoil is sand and bowlders;\r\non the upland, stiff bluish clay, and in some places blue limestone.\r\nWell water is reached on the bottom land at a depth of 8 to 10 feet,\r\nthrough soil moist all the way; on the upland, it is necessary to dig 60\r\nto 100 feet, and, beginning two or four feet from the surface, the\r\nground is dry. When seed is planted in the spring, the soil should be\r\nwell pulverized, moist, and warm, that the seed may germinate quickly.\r\nIt should not be put in deeper than 1¹⁄₂ inches, and may be planted in\r\nMay or June, or any time in the spring after the soil becomes warm. In\r\nour climate, it is best to sow about 30 pounds of good seed to the acre,\r\nbesides just enough oats to shade the ground and protect the young\r\nalfalfa from the hot sun. Once well started, it will kill out all weeds,\r\nand does not winterkill here. We irrigate from streams. Alfalfa should\r\nnot be irrigated when quite young, for, if the small plant is covered\r\nwith soil, when watered, it will not come up again, but, after it gets a\r\ngood start, it is not easily killed. There should be about two\r\nirrigations to each crop harvested, or ordinarily, six in a season. The\r\nheavier the stand the more water is needed. We have three cuttings,\r\nyielding about 3,000 pounds of cured hay per acre per cutting. When the\r\nplant is fairly well in bloom, it is cut, and is best when cured under\r\nlarge sheds or in the shade. If left until dry where cut, the foliage\r\nwill fall off and pulverize. It is best to stack in narrow ricks, as it\r\nis liable to heat if put in large stacks, and it should be salted\r\nliberally when stacked. The last cutting is preferred for seed, which is\r\nmowed when most of the pods are well matured; in this case only two\r\ncrops should be cut during the year. The straw makes good feed for stock\r\nin winter, having about half the value of the hay. Each irrigation costs\r\nabout 50 cents per acre, and the total cost of hay in the stack is about\r\n$3.50 per ton. Baling costs $1.25 per ton, with 50 cents additional for\r\nwire. The common yield of seed is 6 to 10 bushels from the acre.\r\n“Reeves” clover huller will thresh about 12 bushels per hour. The price\r\nof hay, baled, in New Mexico has averaged about $8 per ton for the past\r\neight years and seed for the same time about $5 per bushel. Our\r\nexperience indicates that alfalfa hay is a more nutritious food for farm\r\nanimals than either clover or timothy. We have found nothing better to\r\nfeed cattle for market; it makes good, solid beef, and they take on fat\r\nvery fast. The pasturage is excellent for swine, horses, and cattle. If\r\noverfed, animals will sometimes bloat on rank alfalfa, especially if\r\nunaccustomed to it. About the third year from seeding, the plant has\r\nacquired its best yield. It is difficult to rid land of it, as plowing\r\nunder is sometimes beneficial, making it come up thicker than before.\r\nSuccess with it on high prairies depends upon the precipitation during\r\nthe growing season. We think four inches of rainfall during the time of\r\nits growth would make a fair crop of hay; or 8 to 12 inches from May to\r\nSeptember, for two or three cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\n_Isaac Zoller, Montgomery county_, writes in a recent article in\r\n_American Agriculturist_:--“In the spring of 1889, I sowed my first ten\r\nacres of alfalfa. The field was reseeded for the second time in April,\r\n1905. I now have 25 acres. The land was plowed in the fall after being\r\nmanured. In the spring, generally during the last two weeks of April,\r\nthe surface for five or six inches is made extra fine and 25 to 30\r\npounds of the best seed are sown with three pecks of oats as a nurse\r\ncrop. By June 1 the oats are cut three inches above ground and again\r\nevery four weeks during the first season. The following June during the\r\nthird week the first crop is cut, usually yielding about three tons. The\r\nsecond cutting generally comes during the last week in July when 1¹⁄₂\r\ntons is an average. By September, the third cutting is made, but I\r\ngenerally let sheep browse it, but not very close or after it is frozen.\r\nThe season of 1905 it was cut and allowed to wilt, raked with a side\r\ndelivery rake, allowed to lie a couple of hours, then rolled over with\r\nthe rake and drawn to the barn. Formerly I used to shock it and allow it\r\nto sweat, but this is too much work. I feed it to sheep and find it\r\nequal, if not superior to Red clover. To be at its best it must be cut\r\nwhen about one-tenth of the blossoms are out. The soil in which my\r\nalfalfa grows is a heavy, clay loam and rolling, but is underdrained.\r\nThe soil here is apt to heave three or four inches during winter and\r\ninjure clover. But where properly drained, this does not occur on\r\nalfalfa fields. I am certain alfalfa can be more extensively and\r\neconomically grown here.”\r\n\r\n_H. B. Fullerton, Long Island._--As an experiment, an acre of scrub-oak,\r\nwaste land was cleared and the brush and stumps burned in November,\r\n1905. About 2,000 pounds of wood ashes were applied and turned under at\r\nonce. In April about ten tons of manure was applied so that each quarter\r\nacre would have about 2,500 pounds. Three weeks later 400 pounds of\r\nkainit were applied and ten days later 200 pounds of Canada wood ashes.\r\nSince the soil, when tested, still showed acidity, about 400 pounds more\r\nof ashes were spread, chiefly because of its high percentage of\r\nvegetable lime, 40 per cent. The lime of ashes on Long Island soils is\r\nconsidered superior to that of stone or shells. Early in June the test\r\nacre, being considered ready, was finally prepared and sown to alfalfa\r\nin two directions crosswise over each quarter acre. In less than a week\r\nthe plants appeared evenly on all four plots. Showery weather continued\r\nfrom before seeding until well into June. One of the quarter acre plots\r\nsown with a dressing of 150 pounds of soil from an old alfalfa field at\r\nFayetteville, N. Y., early took the lead in color and vigor and about\r\nsix weeks from sowing could be readily distinguished at a distance by\r\nthe richness of its foliage. It was also in flower before the other\r\nplots, one of which was uninoculated, the other two sown with inoculated\r\nseed. Unfavorable weather prevented cutting until mid-August when all\r\nfour plots were cut, the few large weeds were removed and the alfalfa\r\nweighed. The plot inoculated with alfalfa soil yielded 1673 green pounds\r\nwhich cured to 701 dry; the uninoculated plot yielded 726 green and 313\r\ndry, the other two plots sown with inoculated seed 416 and 377 pounds\r\ngreen or 189 and 168 pounds dry respectively. These results point\r\nfavorably to inoculating the soil from old alfalfa fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Sweet Clover= (_Melilotus alba_.)\r\n\r\nThe seed of Sweet clover is an occasional adulterant of alfalfa. The\r\nplant is much taller than any of the species of Medicago. The flowers\r\nare white and borne in rows on elongated flower stems]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =Yellow Trefoil= (_Medicago lupulina_.)\r\n\r\nA common adulterant of alfalfa. The leaflets are broader and more\r\nclover-like than alfalfa. The flowers are yellow and sparsely scattered\r\nin small, hop-like clusters at tips of long flower stems]\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n_Dr. B. W. Kilgore, Director North Carolina experiment\r\nstation._--Alfalfa has been grown in a small way in this state,\r\nparticularly in the section around Hillsboro, for 75 to 100 years. The\r\nsoil there has become well inoculated and there are some small areas of\r\ngood alfalfa grown there. There has been for a number of years past\r\nconsiderable interest in the production of this crop, but its\r\ncultivation has not been very successful. On our experiment farms in\r\ndifferent sections of the state it has done reasonably well, and there\r\nhave been put out quite a large number of small areas during the last\r\nfew years, which give hopes of success with the crop. When some further\r\ndetails regarding the time and method for seeding and treatment,\r\nespecially to prevent crab grass and weeds from getting the upper hand\r\nof the crop during the summer have been worked out, we believe that\r\nalfalfa will be grown to quite a large extent and be a most valuable\r\naddition to our present forage crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH DAKOTA\r\n\r\n_Prof. J. H. Shepperd, Dean of the North Dakota Agricultural\r\ncollege._--Alfalfa has not been given a thorough trial by the people of\r\nNorth Dakota, but the results secured by the experiment station indicate\r\nthat it is capable of producing paying crops here. It will yield two or\r\nmore tons of hay per acre annually and will, when sown on well drained\r\nland, continue to live from year to year as it does in old alfalfa\r\ndistricts. A little growth should be allowed to stand through the winter\r\nseason to protect the roots by catching a covering of snow over the\r\nentire field. Our people are thoroughly awakened and encouraged by the\r\nresults secured at the experiment station, and its growth is likely to\r\nsoon be a common practice in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nOHIO\r\n\r\n_Prof. Charles E. Thorne, Director Ohio experiment station._--Numerous\r\nattempts were made during the latter half of the nineteenth century to\r\ngrow alfalfa in Ohio, but so far as the knowledge of the writer goes,\r\nthat of Joseph E. Wing of Mechanicsburg was the first that could be\r\npronounced a decided success. Mr. Wing had seen the plant growing in the\r\narid region of the West, and was fortunately able to make his initial\r\nexperiments on the soil formed from the decomposing limestone gravels of\r\nChampaign county, a soil possessing three of the indispensable\r\nrequisites for alfalfa culture. Plenty of lime, plenty of humus and good\r\ndrainage. Other farmers during recent years have attempted the culture\r\nof this plant, and where experiments have been conducted upon suitable\r\nsoils and carried out with sufficient care and persistence, they have\r\nbeen successful. Thus far the most promising alfalfa fields in the state\r\nare to be found either in such localities as those of Mr. Wing, namely\r\nupon the soils underlaid with limestone gravel which are found over the\r\nwestern half of the state, or upon such of the river bottom lands of the\r\nstate as are above overflow and are underlaid with gravel, giving\r\nnatural drainage. The experience of Ohio growers of alfalfa has\r\ndemonstrated the following points: (1) Alfalfa must have lime. If the\r\nsoil is naturally deficient in this substance it must be added\r\nartificially. (2) Alfalfa must have humus. It is idle to attempt to grow\r\nit upon a soil which has been worn so thin that it will not grow a good\r\ncrop of corn. Such soils must be manured before they will successfully\r\nproduce alfalfa. In this respect it is very different from the plant\r\nwhich it so closely resembles in habit of growth, Sweet clover. (3)\r\nAlfalfa will not grow with wet feet, yet it is a great consumer of\r\nwater, and the soil must be of such a character as to hold large stores\r\nof water without being water logged. Hence the value of bottom lands\r\nnaturally underdrained by strata of gravel a few feet below the surface.\r\n(4) When lime, humus and drainage are supplied, the bacterial organisms\r\nthrough which atmospheric nitrogen is assimilated will gradually appear\r\nupon the alfalfa roots, but their growth may be hastened by inoculating\r\nthe land with soil from a field in which alfalfa or Sweet clover has\r\npreviously grown. The experiment station has been most successful in\r\ngetting a stand of alfalfa where the land was thoroughly prepared in the\r\nspring and then harrowed every week or ten days until July or August.\r\nThe seed was then sown and harrowed in. By this means the weed seeds\r\nwere germinated and destroyed before the alfalfa was sown.\r\n\r\n\r\nOKLAHOMA\r\n\r\n_Agricultural experiment station_: Bul. 71, by Prof. F. C. Burtis and L.\r\nA. Moorhouse.--This crop is being grown in every county in Oklahoma and\r\nin some sections, a fair acreage is present. From many fields as large\r\nyields are obtained as are produced any place else in the United States\r\nwithout irrigation. On the uplands in Oklahoma, as elsewhere, the\r\nreturns vary. Where the subsoil is hard and impervious, the yields are\r\nquite meager under unfavorable climatic conditions and the crop needs\r\nconsiderable nursing such as disking and harrowing, to keep the crab\r\ngrass from taking the field in a few years. On these upland soils with\r\nthe hardpan subsoils which grow cowpeas to perfection, the farmer who is\r\nnot willing to inform himself about proper methods and to give his\r\nalfalfa fields much attention and care, should grow cowpeas instead. But\r\nas has been indicated before, alfalfa is being grown on such soil\r\nsuccessfully and profitably, but only in small areas.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the experiment station farm at Stillwater, on which the\r\nfollowing yields of alfalfa were obtained is a clay loam underlaid by a\r\nvery stiff, impervious subsoil of a hardpan nature.\r\n\r\nYields of Field F, containing about four acres; cured hay for the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n1902--1.76 tons hay per acre in 5 cuttings.\r\n\r\n1903--1.23 tons hay per acre in 5 cuttings.\r\n\r\n1904--3.13 tons hay per acre in 4 cuttings.\r\n\r\n1905--3.13 tons hay per acre in 5 cuttings.\r\n\r\nAverage for four years, 2.31 tons of hay per acre.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1904 the field received an application of barnyard\r\nmanure at the rate of 15 tons per acre. Every season, the field was\r\ndisked from three to four times and harrowed. During 1903 and 1904, web\r\nworms damaged the crop.\r\n\r\nYields of Plats 1, 2, 3, and 4, Field E. The plats are on similar soil\r\nto that of Field F and have been handled about the same as that field.\r\nThe yield is given for all the plats together.\r\n\r\n1902--2.67 tons hay per acre.\r\n\r\n1903--3.27 tons hay per acre.\r\n\r\n1904--3.31 tons hay per acre.\r\n\r\nAverage for three years, 3.08 tons of hay per acre.\r\n\r\nYield of Field H, containing about five acres:\r\n\r\n1902--4.20 tons hay per acre in 5 cuttings.\r\n\r\n1903--2.88 tons hay per acre in 5 cuttings.\r\n\r\n1904--2.12 tons hay per acre in 5 cuttings.\r\n\r\n1905--2.27 tons hay per acre in 5 cuttings.\r\n\r\nAverage for four years 2.69 tons per acre.\r\n\r\nBarnyard manure was applied to this field in 1900-’01, and it was given\r\nthe same treatment as was received by the fields previously mentioned.\r\nOther results will be given in a later bulletin, but those cited give a\r\nfair idea of what may be expected on upland where the subsoil is a\r\nhardpan. The hay from all the fields mentioned above, obtained in the\r\nlast two or three cuttings, contained varying amounts of crab grass, so\r\nthe yields given are not all alfalfa. Since the above results were\r\nobtained, some good bottom land has been acquired by the experiment\r\nstation and alfalfa has already been seeded on some of it. In a few\r\nyears, yields that will look better when compared with those of our best\r\nalfalfa growers can probably be reported. The following summary will be\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\n1. Alfalfa is a great and valuable crop for Oklahoma, where there are as\r\ngood alfalfa soils as are found in the world and as good yields are\r\nproduced as anywhere.\r\n\r\n2. The acreage of alfalfa should be greatly increased in Oklahoma. There\r\nare but few farms here that do not contain a few acres at least that\r\nwill grow the crop profitably.\r\n\r\n3. Select the best soil on the farm for the first trial, and try only a\r\nfew acres at first.\r\n\r\n4. Decide a year or two in advance of seeding time what field is to be\r\nseeded to alfalfa, and follow the best methods of cropping and\r\npreparation known.\r\n\r\n5. Buy only the very best seed. Get a sample and test it before buying\r\nand purchase your seed a year before you expect to sow it unless you are\r\nsure you can get good seed just when you want it.\r\n\r\n6. Twenty pounds of good seed to the acre is plenty and as low as twelve\r\npounds is all that is used by many.\r\n\r\n7. Seed either with the drill or by broadcasting. Conditions must be\r\nright for either to succeed.\r\n\r\n8. Fall seeding and spring seeding are both followed in Oklahoma with\r\ngood success. If the conditions are not right at seeding time, or turn\r\nout unfavorable after seeding, or while the plants are small, either may\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n9. As a rule fall seeding is preferable in Oklahoma, particularly on the\r\nless adapted soils.\r\n\r\n10. Take due care in harvesting the hay that half its value is not lost\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\n11. Don’t give up trying to raise the crop because you fail in your\r\nfirst attempt or even if the failure continues to the second and third\r\nattempts. Successful alfalfa raisers have stated that in instances they\r\nhave failed as many as five times in getting certain fields started to\r\nalfalfa, and after they did get the field seeded, the returns from it\r\nwould justify reseeding ten times if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON\r\n\r\n_George W. Dunn, Jackson county._--For eight years I have grown 60 acres\r\nof alfalfa on bottom land with granite loam soil, gravelly and sandy.\r\nThe plant does not grow well unless the soil is deep and well drained,\r\nand will not grow where there is a clay subsoil or stagnant water. Well\r\nwater is reached at a depth of 10 to 12 feet, and the soil, unless\r\ncultivated or irrigated, becomes dry and hard in the summer. As soon as\r\nthe heavy frosts in the spring are over, seed may be put in, after\r\nthorough, deep plowing and pulverizing. I always sow broadcast, 20 to 25\r\npounds to the acre, then harrow in and clod-mash or roll. Water for\r\nirrigation is obtained from streams, and it should be applied as quickly\r\nas possible, the best way being to flood the whole field for a few days,\r\nand then take all the water off, as standing water will kill the plant\r\nquicker than anything else. The quantity of water needed the first and\r\nlater years does not seem to differ materially. As soon as the young\r\nalfalfa is high enough, it should be mowed. This kills the weeds, and\r\ngives better chance for growth. Then I cut for hay, but it does not pay\r\nmuch the first year. If land is well drained, the plant lives through\r\nthe winter easily, and by the second or third year is at its best. In\r\nground adapted to its growth, it is almost everlasting, unless killed by\r\ngophers or hogs. After the first season, there are three or four\r\ncuttings, averaging each from one to three tons to the acre. For hay, I\r\ncut as soon as it begins to bloom freely, ordinarily raking the next\r\nday, and cocking the third, in this dry atmosphere. The stack does not\r\nshed water well, and the best plan is to put in a good barn. The hay\r\nbales well, and the size of bale is simply a matter of opinion or\r\nconvenience, there being no difference in the keeping quality. The\r\nsecond crop is the one for seed, as the first always contains more or\r\nless foul stuff, and the third will not mature seed. I dispose of hay at\r\nfrom $4 to $10 a ton--the same price as other hay in the same\r\nmarket--and it is in great demand for milch cows. The seed costs me from\r\n10 to 16 cents a pound. The straw makes good feed, but of course is not\r\nso good as the hay. For feeding farm animals, alfalfa is superior to\r\nclover or timothy. We produce as fine beef here, by feeding alfalfa\r\nalone, as can be done in Kansas or elsewhere by feeding ordinary hay and\r\ncorn. The pasturage is profitable and satisfactory for horses and sheep,\r\nand for hogs it is unsurpassed--they will grow and fatten on it without\r\nother food. Cattle on the pasture sometimes bloat, but not when they are\r\nused to it, or when it is dry. I keep about 150 head, and in eight years\r\nhave lost but two. The roots will grow to, but not into, water, and\r\nthrive in deep gravelly or sandy soil. The plant sends down a large,\r\nstraight taproot, which, as it approaches water, branches and spreads\r\nout into numerous small rootlets.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n_Prof. George C. Watson, Pennsylvania experiment station._--The\r\nexperiment station has received many letters requesting information\r\npertaining to the growth and cultivation of alfalfa. From these\r\ncommunications it has been learned that many farmers have attempted to\r\ngrow alfalfa on land that is not at all well suited for this purpose,\r\nand consequently, many failures have resulted. The first attempts to\r\ngrow alfalfa were made wholly by spring seeding, which, in most\r\ninstances, has proved quite unsatisfactory. As alfalfa starts slowly and\r\nexists as a small plant for a considerable length of time, the weeds\r\nhave an abundant opportunity to germinate and outgrow the more delicate\r\nalfalfa plants. Whatever conditions favor the growth of weeds,\r\nparticularly in the early part of the growing season, materially\r\nincrease the risk of failure with alfalfa. Largely on account of the\r\nweeds and grass, late in summer or fall seeding has been most\r\nsatisfactory. While a drouth at this time may seriously interfere with\r\ngermination, yet the injury from insufficient moisture is not likely to\r\nbe so great as that from a rank growth of weeds earlier in the season.\r\nLand that has been cultivated for a few weeks during the summer may be\r\nsown to alfalfa in August or September with comparatively little danger\r\nfrom annual weeds, which are so troublesome in spring seeding. Land that\r\nis infested with noxious perennial weeds and grass would not, of course,\r\nbe in suitable condition for seeding after a few weeks of cultivation,\r\nno matter how thorough it may be. The most tenacious grasses and weeds,\r\nlike Canada thistles and quack grass, should be given at least a few\r\nmonths of thorough cultivation before seeding. Experiments indicate that\r\nalfalfa will not survive continued alternate freezing and thawing if the\r\nsoil contains very much moisture. Land that is at all inclined to\r\n“heave” is not suited for the growth of this crop. The soil of the\r\nstation farm, upon which most of these experiments have been made, is a\r\nporous limestone clay underlaid with limestone rocks which afford\r\nabundant drainage through the fissures. Notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthe soil is naturally well drained, in some places it seems to hold too\r\nmuch water to afford a most congenial home for alfalfa. This crop will\r\nendure severe freezing, provided the soil is sufficiently dry so that it\r\nhas no tendency to “heave.” Land upon which clover will “heave”\r\nundoubtedly contains too much moisture for alfalfa. It seems to be able\r\nto endure the rigors of winter better than clover, provided the moisture\r\nconditions are favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND\r\n\r\n_Dr. H. J. Wheeler, Director Rhode Island experiment station._--Alfalfa\r\nculture in Rhode Island is a very uncertain undertaking. A few persons\r\nhave occasionally met with some success, but the majority of experiments\r\nhave been failures because: (1) Most of the soil in this state is too\r\ndeficient in carbonate of lime to enable alfalfa to succeed even if\r\nother conditions are favorable. (2) It is occasionally almost destroyed\r\nby clover leaf spot. (3) The general culture of alfalfa in this state\r\ncannot be made successful even if all of the conditions aside from the\r\nclimate are made favorable. Farther north where the snow falls before\r\nthe ground freezes and remains until the opening of spring, this plant\r\ncan be grown successfully. Farther south where the changes are less\r\nsevere, the same is true. In Colorado and other places where irrigation\r\nis practiced, if it is desired to get rid of a field of alfalfa, the\r\nground is flooded after it is frozen and the freezing of water over the\r\nsurface accomplishes what is desired. In Rhode Island it not\r\ninfrequently happens that we have in winter a considerable fall of snow.\r\nA warm southeasterly rain may fall which transforms it very shortly to\r\nslush. In a few hours the temperature may drop to zero or below.\r\nSometimes rain which falls freezes over the surface, forming a solid\r\ncoating. These conditions in this state destroy the alfalfa just as the\r\nflooding does it in the West, and while alfalfa may be carried\r\nsuccessfully through the winter, if the season is favorable, I believe\r\nthe chances are too great to make it a promising crop. Last winter we\r\ncarried some through successfully and have done so once or twice before,\r\nbut my advice to Rhode Island farmers is to grow the clovers, soy beans,\r\nand possibly cowpeas rather than attempt to embark in growing alfalfa\r\nuntil it has been definitely shown by experiment that the climate and\r\nother conditions can be successfully combated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n_Prof. C. L. Newman, Agriculturist South Carolina experiment\r\nstation._--We have, to some extent, had remarkable success with alfalfa.\r\nOn the old exposition grounds at Charleston, over six tons of cured hay\r\nwere cut last year on one acre. This year one cutting afforded 4.15\r\npounds of cured hay. In the upper portion of the state, alfalfa is grown\r\nwith considerably greater difficulty. At Anderson, the county seat of\r\nAnderson county, there is an alfalfa field that was sown 65 years ago\r\nand it still affords some return.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH DAKOTA\r\n\r\n_Prof. James W. Wilson, Director South Dakota experiment\r\nstation._--Experience shows that a good stand of alfalfa can be secured,\r\nif ordinary care be exercised in preparing the seedbed. It is not a\r\nplant that does well when sowed on the native prairie sod after disking.\r\nOn the college farm during the spring of 1904 a small area of native sod\r\nwas disked five times; part was sowed to alfalfa and part to clover. The\r\nnext spring only a few scattering plants of alfalfa could be found,\r\nwhile a fair stand of clover was secured. Good results have been\r\nobtained with both the Turkestan and the American varieties. Neither has\r\nwinterkilled during the time, and the yield per acre in each case has\r\nbeen good. A field sowed to Turkestan alfalfa in 1899 at Highmore Forage\r\ntesting station still produces good yields. The quantity of seed to sow\r\nper acre depends largely on the way it is sowed, requiring more if\r\nbroadcast than when drilled. We suggest 20 pounds when drilled and 25\r\npounds when sown broadcast. The time to sow depends upon the condition\r\nof tilth. Contrary to what is sometimes supposed, alfalfa does not\r\nrequire a wet soil, but one that is well drained, with a loose subsoil.\r\nThe plants will stand cutting several times during the first year. This\r\nmethod should be resorted to when sown on a field badly infested with\r\nweeds, in order to secure a stand of alfalfa. In 1902 a field rented by\r\nthe college farm, which had been cropped for several years and become\r\nfoul with mustard, was sowed to alfalfa. It was cut three times during\r\nthe growing season, and the result was that in 1903 there was\r\npractically no mustard to be seen, but a first class stand of alfalfa\r\nwas obtained.\r\n\r\n_George E. McEathron of Beadle county_ writes: “I consider alfalfa and\r\nclover culture practicable in this locality. I do not think it necessary\r\nto inoculate soil for these crops in South Dakota. After the first year\r\nI cut my alfalfa fields three times and secured an average yield of five\r\ntons to the acre. I have never allowed seed to mature, always cutting\r\nfor hay. No trouble from winterkilling has been noticed.”\r\n\r\n_O. S. Jones of Lake county_ writes: “I began raising alfalfa on my\r\nplace two miles west of Madison five years ago. The soil is a dark loam\r\nwith some sand in it, lays level and has a sand and gravel subsoil.\r\nWater is obtained at a depth of eight to ten feet. I have used both the\r\nTurkestan and the common alfalfa, and I consider the latter the better\r\nfor my land, as it grows ranker, with more leaf and better color than\r\nthe former. I have had the best success in sowing about the first of\r\nMay, without a nurse crop. On one four-acre piece seeded three years\r\nago, I pastured 150 to 175 head of hogs and spring pigs for two months\r\nthis year and also cut between 15 and 16 tons of hay in two cuttings. I\r\nsowed 12 acres this year in two six-acre fields, that have been\r\npastured, continually, with 175 head of hogs and pigs and ten head of\r\nyoung cattle since early in July, and a great deal of it matured seed.\r\nI could have cut these pieces in August with profit had I so desired,\r\nand then had plenty of growth to have kept the stock in pasture,\r\nchanging pastures each week.”\r\n\r\n_N. O. P. Synoground of Brown county_ writes: “I consider alfalfa and\r\nclover culture practicable in this locality. I also consider the\r\nTurkestan variety superior to the home-grown varieties. Cut the field\r\ntwice the first year and received four tons per acre. I have never cut\r\nany for seed. These crops have not winterkilled here.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE\r\n\r\n_Prof. H. A. Morgan, Director Tennessee experiment station._--Alfalfa\r\nhas been known in Tennessee for many years, but not until the general\r\nfailure of Red clover, due to one or more species of _Colletotrichum_,\r\nand the search for substitutes for Red clover, were any serious efforts\r\nmade to grow alfalfa in this state. On alluvial land along the\r\nMississippi river in west Tennessee, in what is known as the Central\r\nBasin section of middle Tennessee, and on the richer lands of east\r\nTennessee, alfalfa has been grown very successfully, and each year large\r\nareas are being sown to this clover. Mr. L. Donaldson, of Lake county,\r\ngives the following relative to the preparation of soil, etc., for\r\nalfalfa in the alluvial area of west Tennessee: “The land is plowed deep\r\nwith large moldboard breaking plows in September or about the first of\r\nMarch. It is then harrowed until thoroughly pulverized, and either about\r\nOctober 10 or April 1, two gallons of seed are sown, by machine or by\r\nhand. The harrow is used for covering the seed. We have no more trouble\r\nwith the crop after seeding. The plants germinate and take root\r\nrapidly. I have known alfalfa roots to reach a length of two feet from\r\nthe last of March to June 25. We frequently cut the crop five times per\r\nyear.” George Campbell Brown of Maury county states that he has sown\r\nalfalfa in March using spring barley as nurse crop, and in September\r\nwith success. Land sown to alfalfa in 1901 yielded four cuttings per\r\nyear in 1902, 1903, and 1904, averaging from 16 to 18 tons per acre in\r\nthe three years. Mr. Brown uses soil for inoculating, and believes he\r\nhas gotten well-defined results from nitro-culture sent out by United\r\nStates department of agriculture. At the experiment station at\r\nKnoxville, alfalfa has been successfully grown for many years. Heavy\r\napplications of farmyard manure and the use of 300 pounds of acid\r\nphosphate and 25 bushels of lime per acre invariably insures large\r\nyields of alfalfa. Crab grass, _Panicum sanguinale_, in summer and\r\nchickweed, _Stellaria media_, in winter are enemies to alfalfa in this\r\nlatitude. These pests should be gotten rid of by the use of clean\r\nculture crops preparatory to the sowing of alfalfa. With plenty of\r\nstable manure, lime, and phosphorous, artificial inoculation seems\r\nunnecessary. Any soil of over a few feet deep may be prepared so as to\r\ngrow profitable crops of alfalfa. This preparation is much more\r\nexpensive on some soils than others.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXAS\r\n\r\n_Prof. B. C. Pittuck, Agriculturist of the Texas experiment\r\nstation._--Alfalfa should receive the attention of farmers in every\r\nsection of Texas where conditions are in any way favorable to its\r\ngrowth. At present prices, after it is once established, a yield of one\r\nton of hay per acre will afford a good profit, while yields of four and\r\nsix tons, which are not unusual on favorable soils, make the investment\r\nexceedingly profitable. The present demand is much greater than the\r\nsupply and bids fair to increase in greater proportion during the coming\r\nyear. Its increasing popularity with the farmer is based upon sound\r\nbusiness principles, as its value does not consist solely in its market\r\nprice, but in its value as food for his stock and food for his soil. It\r\nwill furnish green pasturage and hay of the best quality without\r\nmaterially impoverishing the soil. Many farmers refrain from planting\r\nalfalfa because some neighbor, far or near, planted on land apparently\r\nsimilar to theirs, and it died of the disease commonly known as cotton\r\nroot rot. It would be far better for each farmer to test his own land,\r\nfor alfalfa may be affected by this fungus at one place and entirely\r\nunaffected on ground only a few rods away. The value of an alfalfa\r\nmeadow is such as to warrant a farmer in giving considerable time, labor\r\nand study to the plant, before deciding that natural conditions prohibit\r\nhim from successfully growing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTAH\r\n\r\n_Aaron F. Farr, Jr., Cache county._--Fifteen years ago, when I began\r\nraising alfalfa, I had 40 acres, and for the past eight years I have had\r\nabout 135 acres, all on heavy clay soil, containing considerable salt,\r\nand underlaid with very stiff, white clay. The soil is dry on top, but\r\nbelow a depth of 2¹⁄₂ feet is damp, and salty water is found at a depth\r\nof eight feet. Small grain was raised on the new land for one or two\r\nyears, after which the ground was plowed in the fall, and again in the\r\nspring, harrowed, and well pulverized. Seed was put in, 12 pounds to the\r\nacre, two inches deep, with a press drill. The time for sowing is about\r\nthe same as for corn, in April or May. If there is plenty of water, it\r\nis well to sow the alfalfa with oats, and then cut for hay the first\r\nseason. Some of my land is irrigated, by flooding, three times in the\r\nseason, by means of a large canal from the river. The more water is\r\nused, the more alfalfa there will be, but the hay from unirrigated land\r\nis less sappy than that which has been watered. The plant is not liable\r\nto winterkill here, and on sandy loam and gravel soils the full yield is\r\nattained the second year, while, on heavy soils, it requires three or\r\nfour years. I have some that is 20 years old, and cannot say how long it\r\nwill yet continue vigorous. There is difficulty in ridding land of the\r\nplant, unless it is flooded in the winter time. We have usually two\r\ncuttings each season, with an average yield for each of about two tons\r\nto the acre, although some parts of the land yield four tons at each\r\ncutting. I have found it more profitable to raise seed than hay, and for\r\nthis purpose I prefer the second cutting, using the self-rake, allowing\r\nthe alfalfa to lie in small piles until dry, then hauling, stacking, and\r\nthreshing, the same as wheat. The hay lies about 22 hours in the swath,\r\n24 hours in the windrow, and one or two days in the cock, after which it\r\nis stacked in large ricks with a horse fork. If properly cured, it will\r\nnot mold or heat, as it will if damp. On land valued at $30 an acre, the\r\ncost of the alfalfa, in the stack, is about $1.50 a ton. The cost of\r\nbaling is about $2 a ton, the popular weight for bales being about 100\r\npounds. An average yield of seed is from 300 to 500 pounds to the acre.\r\nThreshers take one-sixth toll, and can thresh about 100 bushels in a\r\nday. The common machinery saves only about two-thirds of the seed. A\r\nbushel of seed weighs more than 60 pounds, and we put 175 pounds in a\r\ntwo-bushel seamless sack. The average selling price of the seed is about\r\n$3.50 a bushel. I have one piece of land, containing 60 acres, not\r\nirrigated, valued at $30 an acre, from which, for ten years, I have cut\r\none crop of hay, and one of seed, and realized an annual net profit of\r\n$1000 cash. As compared with clover and timothy for feeding farm\r\nanimals, my opinion is that alfalfa will fatten quicker, but will not go\r\nso far. The pasturage is profitable and satisfactory for horses and\r\nsheep; for hogs, one acre of it is as good as 2¹⁄₂ of Red clover, and\r\nfor cattle, one acre is as good as two of clover, provided the land is\r\ndry. On wet land, the clover is better for cattle, and, as to bloating,\r\nthe danger is just the same from the two plants. In my opinion, the\r\nplant will do well on side-hills, where the drainage is good, if the\r\nland is plowed deep, and the seed drilled in two inches deep and rolled\r\nwith a heavy roller. Once started, the plant lives almost forever, on\r\nany soil, unless the wrong kind of a winter strikes it. I have an\r\nalfalfa root, taken up in digging a well, that is 21 feet long. The\r\nroots of alfalfa are sure to find the water, if anywhere at all within\r\nreasonable reach.\r\n\r\n_John Jones, Utah county._--I have raised alfalfa 20 years, and now have\r\n250 acres, mostly on sandy loam upland; have some on bottom land, where\r\nit grows too rank for seed. The subsoil is light clay, with water from\r\n15 to 20 feet from the surface. On land with hardpan subsoil, it\r\ndeclines after a few years, unless irrigated often. In digging for\r\nwater, we find the subsoil begins to get dry at about 18 inches, and\r\ncontinues quite dry for 8 or 10 feet; then moisture increases until\r\nwater is reached. We prepare ground by plowing in the fall, drag very\r\nfine in the spring, and sow as early as the season will permit, in order\r\nto catch the spring rains, using 20 to 25 pounds of seed per acre. Our\r\nfirst cutting is made about June 20, and is a little weedy, but there\r\nare fewer weeds in later cuttings. We get about two tons the first\r\ncutting, if the stand is good, and about the same the other cuttings\r\nthat year; have no trouble here about winterkilling; standing water is\r\ninjurious to the plant. Here alfalfa on uplands is watered three or four\r\ntimes each season; some land needs only one or two floodings, while\r\nother lower lands have no irrigation. After getting a good start from\r\nthe seed, we begin watering about May 1, from small mountain streams.\r\nThe first year requires water about every week; after that, once a month\r\nis sufficient. For hay, we begin cutting with the first bloom, obtaining\r\n2 to 2¹⁄₂ tons from the first cutting, about 2 the second, and from 1 to\r\n1¹⁄₄ the third cutting; let it lie about two days before hauling to\r\nstack, being careful not to stack too green. For seed, begin cutting\r\nwhen seed is ripe, the second crop being considered best. The\r\ngrasshoppers have been troubling the second crop to some extent, and we\r\nhave on that account been cutting the first crop for seed, using a\r\nreaper and separating with a threshing machine. On a basis of 7 per cent\r\ninterest on $30 per acre with five tons of hay per acre each year, it\r\nhas cost about $1.55 per ton to raise alfalfa. We estimate $1 per ton\r\nfor cutting and stacking, and 60 cents per acre for water tax. It costs\r\n$2.25 per ton for baling, 100 to 125-pound bale, the size having no\r\neffect as to the keeping of properly cured hay. From 8 to 10 bushels is\r\na fair average seed yield, the cost of threshing and cleaning being\r\nabout 40 cents per bushel. Baled hay is worth (free on board) about\r\n$6.50, and loose, about $4 per ton; seed sells for about 7 cents per\r\npound. Alfalfa hay is preferable to timothy or clover, ton for ton, for\r\nfeeding without grain; with grain, our liverymen prefer timothy. We find\r\nalfalfa with grain equal to timothy for draft horses, but for drivers,\r\ntimothy is preferred. Alfalfa is considered better than clover by our\r\nhog raisers; it makes good pasturage for horses, and is better than Red\r\nclover for cattle. If cattle are kept continually on the alfalfa, they\r\nare not very likely to bloat; the trouble arises from turning hungry\r\nanimals on it. We use a gag, made of a stick about three inches in\r\ndiameter, to force the mouth open, but sometimes have to make an opening\r\nin the paunch with a knife. Irrigation seems to improve the quantity\r\nwithout increasing the quality. The early cut hay has at least 20 per\r\ncent more value than the straw from the seed crop; we have had very good\r\nresults from feeding the straw, as it always contains more or less seed.\r\nAlfalfa sown on clay soil, with hardpan subsoil, gradually dies out\r\nafter two or three years; also when water is near the surface; when the\r\nroots reach water too near by, the plant dies. Sown on good sandy loam,\r\nit reaches its best yield about the second year; on heavier soils,\r\nabout the third year. We have alfalfa 20 years old, as vigorous and good\r\nto yield as when started. It is preferable to clover for turning under,\r\nas the large roots make more manure, and the tops are much heavier. We\r\ngrow alfalfa on our uplands without irrigation, but it requires two or\r\nthree years to get a start; the first year, it makes a growth of 8 or 10\r\ninches, and wilts; second year, it grows a little taller, thickens up\r\nsomewhat, and then, apparently, dies; the third year, it gains in height\r\nand strength, and yields a good crop, or even two crops, according to\r\nthe subsoil. If the subsoil is hardpan, I would not predict the result\r\nas worth the effort. I do not see how Utah would get along without\r\nalfalfa. I have 100 acres, from which are cut from 2 to 2¹⁄₂ tons of hay\r\nper acre, and from 800 to 1300 bushels of seed each year, and it has not\r\nbeen irrigated for 15 years. Last year the seed yield was 968 bushels,\r\nand the grasshoppers damaged it considerably; the seed brought 10 cents\r\nper pound on the track here. We make good beef from the hay alone, and\r\nhave done so on the threshed straw.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERMONT\r\n\r\n_Prof. J. L. Hill, Director Vermont experiment station_, in Bulletin No.\r\n114 says that popular interest in the question of alfalfa culture was\r\nnever so great in Vermont as it is today. The result of 56 trials at as\r\nmany Vermont points are summarized: as, permanent successes, 12;\r\ntemporary successes, ten; success at outset, eight; seeming success,\r\nfive; questionable, seven; failure, 14. Thirty-six per cent of the\r\ntrials may fairly be said to have been a success, and 68 per cent of\r\nthese were located in the Champlain valley. Only 10 of the 56 alfalfa\r\ngrowers appear to have sown more than an acre. It should be noted that\r\nsuccess with a fraction of an acre does not of necessity imply that an\r\nequal degree of success would be attained with plantings on larger\r\nareas. The preeminence of the Champlain valley in alfalfa growing seems\r\nto be due to the character of the farming in that section and to the\r\nnature of its soil. Failures may generally be ascribed to one or more of\r\nseveral unfavorable soil or weather conditions, to weeds, to disease, or\r\nto seed which either is inferior or from an unsuitable source. There\r\nseems to be a sufficient proportion of successes in the state to justify\r\nthe encouragement of further trials. It is equally clear, however, that\r\nanyone planting alfalfa for the first time should not only give careful\r\nheed to the needs of the plant and to the methods of culture outlined\r\nlater, but should begin by experimenting in a small way. The most\r\nsignificant thing developed by the analysis of the returns to date is\r\nthat the crop seems to succeed best in the Champlain valley. Why is\r\nthis? Probably one factor, not apparent on the surface, is that the men\r\nwho have succeeded in Addison county are largely sheep breeders who\r\nvalue the crop so highly in their special industry that they are willing\r\nto give more attention to its culture than are the dairy farmers. It\r\nshould be recalled in this connection, however, that the evidence\r\nreviewed indicates practical success with alfalfa at Plattsburgh and in\r\nadjacent Canadian territory. Without pressing the matter to a definite\r\nconclusion, we consider two things to be at least strongly suggested\r\nand worthy to be borne in mind in connection with further experiments\r\nin alfalfa culture: (1) The chances of permanent success with it are\r\nprobably better in Vermont than they are farther south and east in New\r\nEngland. This may be in part attributable to soil conditions and in part\r\nto climate, the latter being associated with greater remoteness from the\r\nseashore. (2) In Vermont the chance of success in its culture seem to be\r\ngreater in the Champlain valley than elsewhere. The reasons suggested in\r\nthe above may apply in explanation of this. The nature of the geological\r\nformations is also worthy of consideration. It seems not unlikely that\r\nthe relative richness of the soil of this region in lime and potash and\r\nits other chemical and physical characters make it especially favorable\r\nto alfalfa growing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA\r\n\r\n_Prof. Andrew M. Soule, Director Virginia experiment station._--In\r\nBulletin No. 154 from this station we summarize as follows: Alfalfa is\r\nbeing grown with success in various parts of Virginia and the\r\nindications are that it will do well in humid climates, providing the\r\nsoil is brought into suitable condition for its growth. Alfalfa has many\r\nuseful qualities. It yields from three to five tons of cured hay in a\r\nyear, and remains on the land for a long period of time when once well\r\nestablished. It grows best on deep, open, porous soils well supplied\r\nwith vegetable matter. The roots of alfalfa are from five to 15 feet in\r\nlength, enabling it to draw much of its food from the subsoil. It thus\r\nenriches the land for succeeding crops and opens it up to the action of\r\nair and water. Land intended for alfalfa should be made very rich by\r\nplowing under legumes or applying farmyard manure. In addition, from 200\r\nto 400 pounds of acid phosphate, Thomas slag or bone meal, with 100\r\npounds of muriate of potash, should be applied per acre. If the land is\r\nacid, which may be determined by testing with blue litmus paper, an\r\napplication of 25 bushels of lime should be made. It is generally best\r\nto use the unslaked lime, which may be applied with a manure spreader, a\r\ngrain drill or broadcasted over the land and covered with a harrow. Land\r\nintended for alfalfa should be carefully cultivated in hoed crops or\r\nsummer fallowed so as to destroy weeds, the worst enemy of alfalfa\r\nduring the early stages of its growth. Alfalfa may be seeded either fall\r\nor spring. When fall sown it can be cut for hay the next summer,\r\nwhereas, the spring sown crop should be clipped several times during the\r\nfirst season and left to mulch the ground. Alfalfa seed is sometimes\r\ninfested with dodder, which grows as a parasite on the plant. The\r\norange-yellow threadlike appearance of dodder gives warning of its\r\npresence, and it can be easily destroyed by cutting and burning if taken\r\nat the outset. Alfalfa is frequently attacked by leaf spot in the\r\neastern states. The disease is easily recognized as its name indicates,\r\nand persistent clipping will generally eradicate it. The amount of seed\r\nto sow varies, but 20 pounds will answer as a rule. Alfalfa should be\r\ncut for hay when coming into bloom, as it yields more nutrients per acre\r\nat that time, and succeeding crops yield better. Alfalfa is not more\r\ndifficult to make into hay than is Red clover. It may also be pastured\r\nto advantage, though there is some danger of bloat, and, owing to the\r\nhigh feeding value of the hay, it is doubtful whether it would be good\r\npractice to graze it in the East, except with hogs. Alfalfa being a\r\nlegume has the power of assimilating atmospheric nitrogen under certain\r\nconditions. It is thus a soil improver. Farmers cannot afford to\r\npurchase nitrogen when they can gather it from the air through the\r\naction of leguminous plants. Alfalfa often fails, even though all the\r\nphysical conditions seem favorable, because the bacteria which live in\r\nthe nodules on its roots are not present in the soil. This deficiency\r\nmay be supplied by getting soil from an old alfalfa field or from fields\r\nwhere Sweet clover or Bur clover previously grew with success, or by\r\nmeans of artificial cultures. The Virginia experiment station, realizing\r\nthe importance of alfalfa to Virginia farmers and the difficulty of\r\nsecuring inoculated soil at a reasonable cost, has undertaken the\r\npreparation of pure cultures which it is distributing at a cost of 25\r\ncents per acre. Soil inoculation through artificial cultures is still in\r\nits experimental stages, but it seems wise that Virginia farmers should\r\nbe given an opportunity to test these cultures at a moderate cost and\r\ndetermine once for all their real value under field conditions. The high\r\nfeeding value of alfalfa has long been recognized. It is admirably\r\nadapted to the needs of all classes of live stock. It has been fed with\r\nprofit to horses, cattle, sheep and swine. It can be so utilized as to\r\nlargely take the place of wheat bran and other expensive concentrates.\r\nThe plats of alfalfa seeded in the spring of 1904, both on the station\r\nfarm and on Brush mountain, show the importance of soil inoculation and\r\nthe advantages of using lime and phosphates on land intended for this\r\ncrop. From a general review of the situation it appears that there is no\r\nreason why alfalfa, under good management, should not succeed in many\r\nparts of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON\r\n\r\n_F. M. Lowden, Walla Walla county._--In 22 years I have had experience\r\nwith from 1 to 400 acres of alfalfa, on bottom, second bottom, and\r\nupland, with clay, sand and loam soils, with subsoil of hardpan and\r\nstrong alkali from 18 to 20 inches below the surface, and water at depth\r\nof 18 to 20 feet. The soil is seldom moist all the way down, the dry\r\nsoil beginning five to eight feet below the surface and ending within\r\ntwo or three feet of the water. After plowing deep and harrowing well, I\r\nsow in the spring, late enough to miss frost, 25 to 30 pounds to the\r\nacre; then cover, in light soil from one to two inches, and in clay soil\r\nless. During the first season it should be mowed so that the weeds\r\ncannot choke it out, and then there will be about a ton of hay to the\r\nacre to be cut in August. I irrigate with water from streams thoroughly\r\nin the spring and after each cutting, using enough water to soak the\r\nground for a few days. New land requires more water than old, but the\r\nquantity needed is about the same every year. At three years the plant\r\nattains its best yields, and with proper care will not need reseeding.\r\nThere are usually three cuttings each season, with an average of 1¹⁄₂\r\ntons to the acre, and I have known five cuttings. It is mowed for hay\r\nwhen it commences to bloom, and for seed any time before the frost\r\ncomes, the second crop being best for the latter use. The seed is\r\nmowed, threshed and dried as any other clover is. The hay should lie\r\nbefore raking until it is thoroughly wilted, then cure in cock two or\r\nthree days. We stack in ricks 16 to 18 feet wide and any desired height\r\nor length. The hay will not heat if well cured before stacking. On land\r\nvalued at $40 an acre, the cost of hay in the stack is about $1.50, and\r\nto bale this costs $2 a ton. The yield of seed is 5 to 10 bushels to the\r\nacre, and it sells for $4.50 to $7.50 a bushel, while hay brings $4,\r\nformerly $8. For threshing, a clover huller is better than the common\r\nmachine. The alfalfa straw is of double the value of any other straw for\r\nfeeding. The hay grown without irrigation is not so rank as that which\r\nis watered, and is consequently more valuable as a feed; any is better\r\nthan timothy, and equal to clover for cattle, but the seed must form in\r\nit to make it valuable for working horses. After cutting three crops in\r\na season, I usually use the field in the fall for pasturing cattle, and\r\nit furnishes nearly double the feed that Red clover will, acre for acre.\r\nFor hogs the pasturage is much better than clover, and I sow with blue\r\ngrass and clover, on rich ground. For horses and sheep the pasturage is\r\nbetter than clover, but causes bloat in the same way. It is difficult to\r\nplow up alfalfa, but continued cultivation will rid land of it when\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n_Oscar Drumheller, Walla Walla county._--Have grown alfalfa for six\r\nyears, and now have 150 acres, part on bottom, some on clay, and a part\r\non slightly sandy soil; subsoil is a thin layer of hardpan; below that a\r\nsort of gumbo, and underneath that a white clay. Abundant water is found\r\nat 10 to 18 feet, moist soil reaching to the water. Our land requires no\r\nspecial preparation for alfalfa; manure is spread on weak spots; we sow\r\n20 pounds of seed broadcast, about May 1st, and harrow once to cover.\r\nSome cut it the first year; some years the crop is not worth touching\r\nfor either hay or seed; there is no trouble here from winterkilling. We\r\nnever irrigate. The first cutting yields about three tons, the second,\r\nabout two and one-half tons, the third, about two tons, and the fourth,\r\none ton. For hay, cutting should begin when in full bloom; we never cut\r\nfor seed, but the first crop is best. The season must govern the time\r\nfor curing, whether two days or 10; it will heat and mold if not dry\r\nbefore stacking; no choice in size of stacks. On land worth $40 per\r\nacre, it costs about $1.50 per ton to grow and put alfalfa in the stack;\r\nbaling costs $1.50 to $2 per ton, the bales weighing 150 pounds. Alfalfa\r\nhay sold for $12 per ton in 1890, and is now selling for $2.50; seed\r\nsells for 10 to 12 cents per pound. For cattle, alfalfa hay leads all\r\nothers; for work animals, it is a little “washy,” but we use nothing\r\nelse; for pasturing hogs, one acre of alfalfa is worth two of clover,\r\nand it is found satisfactory for horses and sheep; alfalfa will pasture\r\nmore cattle than clover, but is more productive of bloat, especially on\r\nwindy days. The best remedy for bloat is to get the foreparts of the\r\nanimal on high ground and splash cold water on its back; when all else\r\nfails, apply the knife to the left side. We prefer unirrigated hay,\r\nwhich seems firmer and less “washy.” Alfalfa reaches its best yields\r\nabout the third year, and will last 20 years; it is not difficult to\r\nkill; it is similar to Red clover for turning under for green manure.\r\nAll cattle here are fed on alfalfa hay alone. I have fed cattle in open\r\nyards in December, January, and February, and made them gain 160 pounds\r\nper steer in three months. If beef on the Pacific coast would bring 3\r\ncents, there would be no better investment than alfalfa. In 1892, we\r\nsold hay for $60 per acre; to-day it will not sell for a third of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST VIRGINIA\r\n\r\n_Prof. J. H. Stewart, Director West Virginia experiment station._--Very\r\nlittle alfalfa is grown in West Virginia. Within the past four or five\r\nyears some stimulus has been given it by current publications, etc., but\r\nextensive growth has not obtained as yet. The attempts to grow it on our\r\nsmall farm at the experiment station have in fact been failures.\r\nHowever, there are a few small tracts that have done well in portions of\r\nthe state. Hon. T. B. Davis of Mineral county and E. W. McNeil of Hardy\r\ncounty are persons who have been successful. I am frank to say, however,\r\nthat the experiences and practice thus far in this state have not proven\r\nit to be a dependable crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN\r\n\r\n_Prof. R. A. More, Agronomist Wisconsin experiment station._--Alfalfa is\r\nreceiving great attention in Wisconsin and dairymen have been quick to\r\nperceive its value. Through the efforts of the experiment station,\r\nalfalfa seed has been disseminated in every county in the state and\r\ncrops have been grown which were highly satisfactory. Experiments at the\r\nstation show that as much protein can be secured from one acre of\r\nalfalfa as from three acres of clover, nine acres of timothy or 12 of\r\nBrome grass. In this experiment four cuttings of alfalfa were secured,\r\ntwo cuttings of clover and one cutting each of timothy and Brome grass.\r\nAlfalfa seed should have its viability tested before the seed is\r\npurchased. Seed that does not give a germination test of 90 per cent or\r\nabove should be rejected. We advise selecting high, well-drained land\r\ninclined to be rolling. A clay loam on a gravelly subsoil is best suited\r\nfor growths of alfalfa. Sow in spring as soon as ground works well,\r\nputting on about twice the cultivation necessary for cereal crops. Where\r\nland is inclined to be weedy, sow three pecks of barley per acre as a\r\nnurse crop. If ground is free from weeds, sow alfalfa seed without nurse\r\ncrop, using at least 20 pounds of seed per acre. Several hundred members\r\nof the Wisconsin experiment association have been carrying on tests with\r\nalfalfa since 1903, and practically all have succeeded in getting good\r\nfields started. Bacteria-laden soil has been shipped to members of the\r\nexperiment association, who are making tests, with directions for\r\nscattering on a small plot, in order to get the proper bacteria\r\nestablished in the soil. The sowing of some alfalfa seed with clover for\r\nthe purpose of getting a few alfalfa plants established as bacteria\r\ndistributers has been followed with good success. These lands when later\r\nsown to alfalfa result in good catches. Alfalfa should be cut when\r\none-tenth is in blossom, and not later than the first week in September.\r\nWe look for greatly increased acreage from year to year as our farmers\r\nlearn the value of this great forage plant.\r\n\r\n_W. D. Hoard, Editor Hoard’s Dairyman._--It is now twelve years since\r\nthe editor of the Dairyman commenced the practical study of alfalfa. A\r\ngood deal of experience as well as observation of the practices of\r\nothers has come to him in that time. He does not feel that he has\r\nexhausted the subject by any means, but there are a few things which he\r\nbelieves to be well settled principles. They may be enumerated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. The richer the soil the better.\r\n\r\n2. A carefully prepared seed bed. Too much pains cannot be had here.\r\n\r\n3. Good seed; every farmer should test the seed he expects to sow. A\r\ngreat amount of failure has come from weak, infertile seed.\r\n\r\n4. Side hills where the rain or melted snow in March will readily run\r\noff and thus prevent an ice cap from sudden freezing is much the\r\npreferable location.\r\n\r\n5. Cutting it each time as soon as the first blossoms appear will always\r\nbring a stronger succeeding growth for the next crop.\r\n\r\n6. Never pasture it unless you wish to weaken it so it will break up\r\nmore easily the next spring.\r\n\r\n7. Always cure it in the cock with hay caps if possible. The quality of\r\nthe hay is greatly superior to that which is cured in the sun or\r\nwindrow.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive quality and value of alfalfa as well as clover may be\r\ngreatly lessened and the owner not be aware of it, by allowing too much\r\nsunshine on the hay. To throw away the feeding value of any food by\r\nunwise methods of handling or curing is very poor economy. For this\r\nreason farmers should make a closer study than they do as to the right\r\ntime of cutting alfalfa and clover and the right way of curing it. Too\r\nmany farmers look only at the labor involved. They want to do it quick.\r\nHence they wait before cutting till the stalks are overripe so they will\r\ndry quickly and then they use hay loaders that will take up the hay in\r\nthe swath overdried and the goodness evaporated out of it by the action\r\nof the sun. All this time they are never giving a moment’s thought to\r\nthe great question: “What kind of food is this going to make for my cows\r\nnext winter?” The best of study and care should be given to this matter\r\nof curing alfalfa and clover. Nicely cured clover is worth half as much\r\nas bran as a milk producing food, and alfalfa is worth fully as much. We\r\nhave demonstrated in our own stables that with 35 pounds of corn\r\nensilage and 10 pounds of nice alfalfa hay a day, we can save half of\r\nthe grain ration that would be necessary if we fed other hay.\r\n\r\n8. As a renewer and renovator of fertility we know of nothing that will\r\nequal alfalfa. The present year is proving that in Wisconsin most\r\nconvincingly. Nearly all of the old alfalfa, as well as clover seeding,\r\nwas killed by an ice storm in March. That compelled the farmers to plow\r\nup these old fields and plant them to corn, potatoes or some sowed crop.\r\nThe greater growth of crops on these old alfalfa fields is universally\r\nnoticed. The farmers of the country have not half begun to know the\r\nwonderful value of the alfalfa plant. For just this reason they should\r\nnot be discouraged in trying to grow it.\r\n\r\n_Dr. A. S. Alexander, Wisconsin experiment station._--After all that has\r\nbeen written and said in favor of the more general cultivation of\r\nalfalfa, it seems strange to find much prejudice and ignorance still\r\nexisting among farmers relative to the merits of this magnificent forage\r\nplant. When we ask a farmer why he has not seeded an area of land to\r\nalfalfa he almost invariably answers by another question; viz., “Do you\r\nthink I can make it catch?” And it is this doubt so generally existent\r\nthat keeps down the area of alfalfa, and hence the profits of many a man\r\nwho could make it a wonderful success.\r\n\r\nTo our mind there has been too much alleged scientific talk relative to\r\n“nitrification,” “root nodules” and “soil inoculation” for alfalfa; so\r\nmuch of it, in fact, as a fad, that the average farmer has become\r\npossessed of the erroneous idea that it requires a deeply scientific\r\nknowledge of the subject and much trouble of various sorts to secure a\r\nstand of alfalfa. For this reason many a man has dismissed the subject\r\nfrom his mind and deemed it best to think most of the simple things\r\nwithin his ken, but in so doing he has missed some of the greatest boons\r\nand blessings possible in his business. Alfalfa will grow on most any\r\ngood land that will produce clover and that is in no way waterlogged.\r\nThere is little mystery in its successful cultivation, and the “tricks”\r\nof the business are easily learned from the literature mentioned. We\r\nbelieve it to be one of the very finest of forage plants and a grand\r\nadjunct in the feeding of hogs; a crop in fact that is bound to become\r\ncommon and that should at once be given far more general attention than\r\nis now the case. It is neither difficult to obtain a catch nor make the\r\ncrop a success if the farmer will but try and in starting follow the\r\nsimple instructions now published by many of the agricultural experiment\r\nstations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING\r\n\r\n_Asil T. Wilson, Fremont county._--For six years I have been raising\r\nalfalfa on first-bench upland, a gravelly loam, with a cement subsoil of\r\na lime nature. Water is found at 40 feet; moist soil is encountered at a\r\ndepth of 12 feet from the surface, and continues until water is reached.\r\nA depth of one inch for seeding is best. Sow in early spring. If alfalfa\r\nand timothy are sown together, sow 20 pounds of the former to 6 of the\r\nlatter; if alone, 20 pounds of alfalfa. No weeds will trouble; cut\r\neither crop for hay; the first crop for seed. Watering after the last\r\ncutting will cause alfalfa to winterkill. Irrigate as early as possible,\r\nif dry, and whenever getting dry, also about five days before cutting;\r\nthe soil being moist after cutting, the next crop will start up quickly.\r\nThe larger the quantity of water used the better if it runs off quickly.\r\nWe obtain water from a stream. After the first year I cut twice,\r\nobtaining two tons each cutting. I cut for hay just as it comes into\r\nbloom, as it is not so woody and more leaves are saved. The first\r\ncutting is preferable for seed. When cutting for seed, wait until the\r\ncurls get well filled and black; put it into cocks and thresh when dry.\r\nAlfalfa hay should be cut one day and raked the next; then cock, and let\r\nit stand two or three days before stacking; by so doing all the leaves\r\nare saved, and it cures in the cock so there is no danger of molding in\r\nthe stack. My alfalfa in stack costs $1 per ton, from land valued at $5\r\nper acre. Irrigation costs 20 cents per acre. Baling costs $3 per ton,\r\n150 pounds in bale. Seed yields six bushels per acre; threshing costs $1\r\nper bushel. Prices for hay have ranged from $5 to $10 per ton, and $7\r\nper bushel for seed. Alfalfa hay is equal to clover or timothy for farm\r\nanimals. For swine pasturage it is better than clover; one acre will\r\npasture 10 head of swine, gaining one pound per head each day. For\r\nhorses and sheep it is good, and as good for cattle as clover, but\r\ndangerous, as they bloat and die. The best yields on upland are from\r\nthree to five years after seeding; and, if watered at proper intervals,\r\nit will last 20 years. There is no difficulty in ridding land of\r\nalfalfa; plow it late in the fall, level it down and mark it, then\r\nwater, and let it freeze up in winter. Alfalfa for green manure is as\r\ngood or better than Red clover. Without plenty of rain, I would not\r\nrecommend growing alfalfa in any locality. Seed raised from alfalfa thin\r\non the ground is best.\r\n\r\n_John H. Gordon, Laramie county._--During the past 10 years, I have had\r\nfrom 10 to 200 acres of alfalfa on second bottom and upland, with sandy\r\nloam from two inches to six feet deep, and below this soft rock, water\r\nbeing found at depths of 20 to 200 feet. I plow or break the soil the\r\nfirst year, and raise a crop of wheat or oats; the second year plow\r\ndeep, sow about half a crop of oats, and when this is well harrowed, sow\r\n20 pounds of alfalfa seed and cover it about two inches deep. To get the\r\nbest results, this seeding is done about April 1st, and there is no\r\ntrouble here with weeds. In cutting the grain, the alfalfa is cut off\r\ntoo, but it does not grow tall enough for hay the first year. The plant\r\ndoes not winterkill, and reaches its full yields by the third or fourth\r\nyear; I have found no necessity for reseeding any of my land. We\r\nirrigate from streams, the quantity of water used depending on the\r\nseason. There are generally three applications of water, about six\r\ninches each time. After the first two or three years, only about half\r\nthe quantity used at first will be needed. After the first year I cut\r\ntwice, and obtain about 1¹⁄₂ tons to the acre each time. The first crop\r\nis best for seed, and is harvested when the top bolls are dead ripe,\r\nraked the day after cutting, bunched for two days and then stacked, to\r\nbe threshed with the common threshing machinery, putting through twice.\r\nFive bushels to the acre is a common yield of seed, and the cleaning and\r\nthreshing cost 50 to 75 cents a bushel. The hay is cut when the greater\r\npart is in bloom, allowed to lie about a day before raking, cured about\r\nthree days, and then stacked, 14 to 16 feet wide, 60 feet long, and 20\r\nfeet high. It does not seem to heat or mold here. The total cost in the\r\nstack is about $1.50 a ton, and baling, in 100-pound bales, costs $2 a\r\nton. Selling price of loose hay in this section is $5 a ton, and the\r\nseed, 10 to 12 cents per pound in the market. The straw is worth about\r\nas much as the hay for feed. I am well satisfied with the general\r\nresults of growing alfalfa here, and am now preparing 200 acres for\r\nseeding. Where it will grow well, it is the best forage plant ever\r\ndiscovered, being good feed for cattle, hogs, sheep, fowls, and, in\r\nfact, all animals on the farm, while as a fertilizer it cannot be\r\nsurpassed.

Figure numbers 44 and 45 are listed in\r\n  reverse order. In the text, references to illustrations are\r\n  hyperlinked to the illustrations. Descriptions such as \"Actual size\"\r\n  in illustration captions are not necessarily applicable to this text.\r\n\r\n  Page 69, In many parts of the country ... that most persistently: In\r\n  the source document the first two lines of this paragraph are repeated\r\n  from the previous paragraph. In the first edition (1906) of the book,\r\n  this paragraph starts: “It is sometimes the case that a field of\r\n  alfalfa is left infested in the fall with such a growth of grass and\r\n  weeds as to make burning in the spring ....”\r\n\r\n  Page 77, table: not all irrigation data add up to the totals given.\r\n\r\n  Page 165 and 338, J.

Fractions (forms 1/2 and 1-2 both occur in the\r\n  source document) have been standardised to ¹⁄₂.\r\n\r\n  Some (minor) obvious punctuation and typographical errors have been\r\n  corrected silently.\r\n\r\n  Texts in a dashed box have for legibility’s sake been transcribed from\r\n  the accompanying illustration, and do not occur as texts in the source\r\n  document.\r\n\r\n  Page viii: entry Index added to Table of Contents.\r\n\r\n  Page ix-xi: Illustration numbers have been added to the List of\r\n  Illustrations. The smaller illustrations have been added to the list,\r\n  with a descriptive caption added where that was not present in the\r\n  book.\r\n\r\n  Page 2: ... it was not introduced into those counties ... changed to\r\n  ... it was not introduced into those countries ....\r\n\r\n  Page 34: ... to snow the result ... changed to ... to show the result\r\n  ....\r\n\r\n  Page 62: Numerous animal and plant parasite ... changed to Numerous\r\n  animal and plant parasites ....\r\n\r\n  Page 98: ... four year prior to writing ... changed to ... four years\r\n  prior to writing ....\r\n\r\n  Page 132, last table row: buckweat changed to buckwheat.\r\n\r\n  Page 153: closing quote mark added after ... corn silage and alfalfa.\r\n  and after ... have never before looked quite so well.\r\n\r\n  Page 164: closing quote mark added after ... that in value approaches\r\n  alfalfa.\r\n\r\n  Page 202: ... facing page 231 ... changed to ... facing page 230 ....\r\n\r\n  Page 257: Paragraph break inserted before _Farmers Guide_ says: ....\r\n\r\n  Page 292: 1904-1.23 tons hay ... changed to 1903-1.23 tons hay ....\r\n\r\n  Page 292, 293: short dashes between year and yield changed to long\r\n  dashes for clarity.\r\n\r\n  Page 300: ... at Highmore Forge testing station ... changed to ... at\r\n  Highmore Forage testing station ....\r\n\r\n  Page 301: _George E.
