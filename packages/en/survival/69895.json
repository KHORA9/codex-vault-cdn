In the Eastern States――that is, those east\r\nof the Mississippi River――a very considerable portion of the forested\r\nareas within each State is in the form of woodlots which are a part\r\nof and an adjunct to the farm so that in any comprehensive forest\r\npolicy for the Eastern United States a great deal of attention must be\r\nfocused upon this phase of the work. This is, undoubtedly, true so far\r\nas Kentucky is concerned where, as a whole, the land is held in fee\r\nsimple by the citizens of the State as farms from a few acres in size\r\nup to several thousand acres. By the majority of the owners of these\r\nfarms, the value and importance of the woodlot is little understood\r\nnor has the practice of forestry as it applies to these woodlots any\r\nsignificance whatsoever. The object of this bulletin is to make clear\r\njust what forestry is, the relation of scientific forestry to the\r\nimprovement of the woodlot and the economical part which the farm\r\nwoodlot plays in the industrial and social welfare of the State. As a\r\nmatter of fact, this is one of the most difficult features of the work\r\nto present properly, because it is a hard matter to make clear to the\r\naverage individual just why a woodlot is an asset in connection with\r\nhis property and how the improvement and care of his woodlot concerns\r\nhim closely and means a proportional increase directly in the actual\r\nmoney value of the material on hand and indirectly in ways which do not\r\npresent themselves readily unless the attention is focused on them――as\r\nfor example, the value of a woodlot as a wind-break in connection with\r\nan orchard or in connection with the farm as a whole, or the value of\r\na wooded area on an easily eroded hillside as a fixative for the soil\r\nand a preventative against the deterioration of the cultivated areas\r\nbelow it. The effort then of this bulletin will be――first, to show\r\nhow the average woodlot may be brought to a standard of productivity\r\ncompatible with the complete utilization of the ground, and second, to\r\nshow in detail what the direct and indirect benefits of a woodlot in\r\nconnection with any farm will be under the best circumstances. In the\r\npreparation of this bulletin, free use has been made of all bulletins\r\nand publications on this subject, which the writer has been able to get\r\nhold of and acknowledgment is made to these as a whole, since it would\r\nbe impracticable to make complete individual acknowledgement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WHAT IS FORESTRY?\r\n\r\nTo the average individual, forestry as a science does not mean\r\nvery much. The impression is that it has to do with the trees, but\r\nto what extent and how it deals with this question is by no means\r\nthoroughly understood. In the first place, forestry deals with trees\r\nas a community and not as an individual――that is, it deals with them\r\nin the bulk and in this respect differs from kindred sciences where\r\nthe individual tree is a matter of concern. The forester is often\r\ncalled upon to answer questions and discuss matters with relation to\r\nshade trees or ornamental trees, but this is not a matter within his\r\nprovince properly, but is a matter for the landscape architect or\r\nhorticulturist. Forestry primarily concerns itself with the planting\r\nand growing of trees for sale at a profit. Occasionally forestry may\r\nconcern itself with the growing and raising of trees for purposes\r\nwhere the money value of the crop, while it may not be as evident as\r\nwhere the trees are placed on the market and sold, is nevertheless, a\r\nreal money consideration. This is the case, where certain areas are\r\nplanted for the purification and conservation of a city water supply.\r\nHere the actual worth of the forest is the value to the people of the\r\ncity or community of pure drinking water. This will be the case in\r\nthe Catskill Mountains where enormous expenditures are being made for\r\nsupplying New York City with pure water and where the purity of this\r\nwater supply depends upon the maintenance of certain areas in forest\r\ngrowth. Forestry then, so far as it relates to the farm and woodlot,\r\nmay be defined as dealing with trees as communities and the growing and\r\nmarketing of these trees for a profit. It is a simple proposition, the\r\nsame as raising corn. In raising corn, the ground is prepared, the seed\r\nis planted at a certain time in the spring, the necessary attention is\r\ngiven during the growing season and in the fall it is harvested and\r\nsold. A certain price is obtained for the grain and a certain price for\r\nthe stalks, usually in the form of fodder for stock. The chief value\r\nof the corn crop depends upon the number of bushels per acre of corn\r\n(grain) that have been produced and the kind and quality of corn there\r\nis to market. The kind and quality of the corn crop depends on the\r\nselection of seed. All this is accomplished within a year’s time――the\r\nplanting, the harvesting, the cultivation and the sale of the product.\r\nForestry is exactly the same proposition. The stock is selected, the\r\ntrees are planted, the necessary attention is given them during the\r\ngrowing period, and eventually the crop is harvested and marketed for\r\nthe best price obtainable. The value of the timber crop depends on\r\nhow much material you raise to the acre, the kind and quality of the\r\nproduct you have to market and the demand in the market for the class\r\nof material to which the timber crop is particularly adapted. The chief\r\ndifference is this: that, whereas, the corn crop has been planted,\r\nharvested and marketed within one growing season, a forest crop takes\r\na period of growing seasons before it is ready to market. The precise\r\nlength of this period depends on the kind of material you are to raise,\r\nas fence posts, ties, lumber, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      IMPROVEMENT OF THE WOODLOT.\r\n\r\nWhat then can be done to show the man most concerned, the farmer, the\r\nimportance of the improvement of his woodlot? First, an attempt will be\r\nmade to set forth the matter as clearly as possible in print, which is\r\nthe object of this bulletin; and the necessary steps will then be taken\r\nto furnish an ocular demonstration of the facts herein set forth by\r\nthe establishment of nurseries and the maintenance of model woodlots.\r\nOn the big majority of farms in Kentucky, there are certain areas which\r\nare not good farm land and never will be for a variety of reasons\r\n(inferior soil, rocky soil, too steep a slope, etc.); but these lands\r\nin most cases can produce timber crops and should be producing them,\r\nsince they are a commercial adjunct to the farm and bring in a revenue.\r\nAs Mr. W. F. Cook, of Hickman County, says, “It is a great deal more\r\nvaluable than giving the land over to weeds and wild briars.”\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, there is little or no attention paid to the woodlot on a\r\nfarm, and without attention a woodlot is in much the same condition\r\nas a corn field in which no attention was paid to the kind of corn\r\nplanted, and which was not cultivated during the growing season. You\r\ncommonly find in a woodlot a great variety of trees, some of a valuable\r\nspecies and some of more or less worthless species. You also find\r\ncrooked and defective and diseased trees, and further you ordinarily do\r\nnot find in any particular woodlot one-half the trees that the ground\r\nwill support, which is about the worst feature of all, since here is an\r\neconomic waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PURPOSES OF THE WOODLOT.\r\n\r\nWhen the improvement of the woodlot is seriously under consideration,\r\none of the first propositions is to determine just what purpose the\r\nwoodlot will serve in the economy of the farm. Ordinarily a woodlot\r\nwill be maintained for the following reasons: 1. To furnish fence\r\nposts; 2. To furnish fuel; 3. As a shelter belt for certain areas\r\nor for the whole farm; 4. As a protection on steep up-lands against\r\nerosion; 5. As a means of regeneration of worn out land; 6. As an\r\ninvestment pure and simple, without regard to immediate returns; 7.\r\nFor the aesthetic value. Any combination of these reasons may prevail\r\nfor the maintenance of a woodlot; however, each one of them will be\r\ndiscussed in its turn as separate propositions.\r\n\r\n1. Probably one of the chief reasons for maintaining the woodlot on\r\nfarms in Kentucky from the purely utilitarian standpoint will be to\r\nobtain fence posts. These are a commodity on the farm which cannot be\r\ndispensed with and for which the demand is staple. Concrete may and\r\nwill at some future date, supersede wood as fence posts, especially\r\nin rich easily accessible agricultural regions where farming is very\r\nprofitable and conducted as a business, but it will do this only\r\nslowly in remote regions, and at the present time concrete posts are\r\nnot extensively used in any locality. A woodlot can then be reasonably\r\nmaintained for the production of fence posts. Ordinarily the posts\r\nare largely consumed on the home farm, since they are more valuable\r\nto the producer at this point than if he should sell them; however,\r\nif there is a surplus, a market for this will not be lacking and the\r\nprice obtained will more than justify the cost of the establishment of\r\nthe woodlot and its maintenance up to the time of harvesting the crop.\r\nIn considering the species which lend themselves most readily to the\r\nproduction of this class of products in Kentucky, undoubtedly, black\r\nlocust (Robinia pseudacacia) sometimes locally called yellow locust,\r\nlends itself most readily to this purpose. It is indigenous to the\r\nState, grows fairly rapidly and lasts a long time in contact with the\r\nsoil, three prime requisites of any species which is to be used in the\r\ngrowing of this class of material. Other species which may be used are\r\ncatalpa (Catalpa speciosa), walnut, osage orange, chestnut and juniper\r\n(also known locally as cedar or red cedar).\r\n\r\n2. As a general proposition, it appears that the maintenance of a\r\nwoodlot for the growing of fuel, so far as Kentucky is concerned,\r\nis not an important consideration. So far as my observation goes\r\nthroughout the State――even in the rural districts――coal is the general\r\nfuel in use on account of the abundance of supply and is in a large\r\nnumber of ways cheaper and preferable to wood as a fuel. On this\r\naccount the woodlot will supply only a very small amount of fuel and\r\nconsideration of this matter is not important. If it does happen that a\r\nsupply of fuel wood is desirable or necessary on the farm, undoubtedly,\r\nhickory and oak lend themselves most readily for this purpose. Any\r\nspecies of hickory grows fairly rapidly, and certain species of oak, as\r\nfor instance red oak, makes a reasonably rapid growth. A woodlot for\r\nthis purpose would be managed as a sprout forest.\r\n\r\n3. The removal of forests and wooded areas of Kentucky has undoubtedly\r\nresulted in certain climatic changes. These are principally to be\r\nnoticed in the prevalence of high winds which formerly did not exist,\r\nand such winds have a marked effect on certain farm activities, as for\r\ninstance the handling of an orchard or the handling of stock. A shelter\r\nbelt, therefore, offers protection to the farm house and surrounding\r\nbuildings. To be of use, the shelter belt or wind break must be in the\r\ndirection of the prevailing winds. Further, since in all probability\r\na shelter belt is of most use and is most desirable in the winter\r\ntime, the component species in the shelter belt should be, to a large\r\nextent, evergreens, so that the effectiveness may be as great in winter\r\nas in summer. In connection with an orchard, a shelter belt or wind\r\nbreak, undoubtedly, protects against cold and destructive currents of\r\nair which injure the orchard in various ways either by injuring the\r\nblossoms of the fruit, or at a later period, by injuring the fruit,\r\nwhich is blown from the trees by the wind and left in bad condition for\r\nshipping.\r\n\r\nThe species then which should compose a shelter belt should, as far as\r\npossible, have these characteristics. They should grow fast to furnish\r\nthe maximum amount of protection in the shortest space of time, and\r\nshould have as wide a usefulness as possible. So far as the majority\r\nof instances are concerned, the shelter belt might have two objects.\r\nThe production of useful material for the farm as fence posts as well\r\nas a wind break. In this case, it would be well to plant black locust\r\nin conjunction with some evergreens, as white pine or Norway spruce,\r\nhemlock or yellow pine. The number of evergreens which may be utilized\r\nfor this purpose in Kentucky are limited, but the number of hardwoods\r\nwhich lend themselves to this purpose is very great, as for instance,\r\nthe hickories, ashes, black locust, poplars, tulip poplar, osage orange\r\nand others. Beech also makes a good tree for the composition of a\r\nshelter belt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chestnut plantation, thirty years old. Photo by U. S.\r\nForest Service.]\r\n\r\n4. As a protection on a steep up-lands against erosion, the chief thing\r\nis to establish a forest cover. The composition of the stand is more or\r\nless immaterial although it is always desirable that the most readily\r\nmarketable species shall be used so that the woodlands in addition to\r\nperforming their protective function may also supply an actual revenue.\r\nTherefore, as far as possible, the trees to be used should be the\r\nashes, oak, chestnut, hickories, maples and other species, whose value\r\nin the lumber market is standard. The chief feature in regard to this\r\nprotective woodland is that the forest cover shall remain unbroken.\r\n\r\n5. As a means of regeneration of worn out land, especially hillsides,\r\nwhich are liable to erosion and do not lend themselves easily to a\r\nscientific rotation of crops, a forest cover is a very important factor\r\nsince it furnishes to the soil the essential humus and, when such\r\nspecies as the black locust or honey locust are planted, it furnishes\r\nthe nitrogenous elements to the soil, since the locusts are legumes and\r\nproduce on their roots nodules of nitrifying organisms similar to those\r\nfound on the roots of alfalfa, cow-peas or soy beans.\r\n\r\n6. As a general proposition, the raising of lumber or timber by an\r\nindividual is out of the question on account of the length of time\r\nwhich it takes to grow the better grades of this material. Ordinarily,\r\na tree fifty years old will furnish only the poorest grades of lumber\r\nand usually only small dimension stock. Generally speaking, one hundred\r\nyears is not too small a calculation for the length of rotation when\r\nlumber is the aim. In the event that any individual plants trees for\r\nthe production of the lumber, such planting is done as an investment\r\npurely and simply since he can not expect to see the crop harvested\r\nwithin his life time. The only monetary benefit that could possibly\r\naccrue to the owner is from the material which may have to be thinned\r\nout or in the event that he should desire to sell his farm when the\r\nexistence of a grove or woodland of healthy young trees would represent\r\nan actual money value to the purchaser. In case planting for this\r\nreason is made, the trees should be those which are the most valuable\r\nlumber producing species, as for instance, the oaks, the ashes,\r\nhickory, sweet gum, tulip poplar, white and yellow pines, basswood and\r\na few others.\r\n\r\n7. It may be that in connection with the farm the presence of a\r\ngrove of trees thereon will represent a value from the aesthetic and\r\nscience standpoint where the beauty of the landscape is a matter of\r\nconsideration to the owner of the land, or to any one who might desire\r\nto purchase it. In this event the kind of tree is not so important as\r\nthe actual presence of trees of some kind. The general effect is the\r\nmain consideration, without regard to the individual features which\r\ncompose this effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FOREST TAXATION.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important factors in connection with the consideration\r\nof woodlots is the matter of taxation, and this is a matter which\r\nso far as Kentucky is concerned, has had little attention. In the\r\nfirst place, there is no classification of land within the State for\r\ntaxation purposes. It is a generally accepted theory among experts in\r\nthis matter at the present time that there is only one fair method\r\nof taxation which may be applied to land maintained by the owner in\r\nforest growth and that is that there should be a tax placed on the land\r\nwhich shall be an annual tax, and another tax placed on the forest\r\ncrop =when it is harvested=. In no other manner does it seem probable\r\nthat reforestation of suitable areas throughout the State may be\r\naccomplished, since in the first place, on account of the character of\r\nthe investment the owner of the land must be assured before hand just\r\nwhat his taxes on the land are to be, and in the second place the risks\r\nattendant upon the raising of a forest crop, because of the long period\r\nof years before it reaches maturity, make it essential that the crop of\r\nforest products shall be taxed at maturity when it is harvested, rather\r\nthan that an annual tax shall be imposed. Certain States have already\r\ngone a long ways in this direction and Pennsylvania has recently\r\npassed three laws dealing with the matter of forest taxation and the\r\nclassification of forest land which embrace the best features of recent\r\nthought on this subject. The essentials of the recent Pennsylvania laws\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Classification of suitable land set aside by the owner for forest\r\npurposes as auxiliary forest reserves.\r\n\r\n2. Agreement with the State to maintain such land in forest growth and\r\npenalties for failure to carry out agreement.\r\n\r\n3. Assessment of land classified as auxiliary forest reserves at $1.00\r\nper acre annual tax.\r\n\r\n4. Payment by owner of 10 per cent of the value of the forest products\r\nwhen harvested to the county to be distributed among the proper county\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n5. Fixed charge on auxiliary forest reserve land of two cents per acre\r\nfor schools and two cents per acre for roads.\r\n\r\nUnder these provisions it is obvious that the growing of timber on\r\nsuitable areas would be reduced to a practical business basis.\r\n\r\nProviding the tax question is sufficiently settled and definite for a\r\nperiod of years the regeneration of the woodlot or the establishment\r\nof one may be undertaken as a safe investment. So far as Kentucky\r\nis concerned, the present tax laws and the manner of handling the\r\nassessments in the counties are not such as to bear heavily on timbered\r\nor wooded areas. In the event that a new classification of land is made\r\nand new tax laws enacted every effort should be made to bring about\r\nsuch a classification of forest land and such a system of taxation as\r\nwill encourage the reforestation of suitable areas and the regeneration\r\nof the present woodlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     REGENERATION OF THE WOODLOT.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of the regeneration of the woodlot is seriously\r\nconsidered there are several points which stand out prominently as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. Protection.\r\n    2. Taking of stock.\r\n    3. Removal of undesirable species.\r\n    4. Selection of desirable species.\r\n    5. Method of regeneration.\r\n    6. Care and management.\r\n\r\n1. =Protection.= It is essential that a woodlot shall be protected if\r\nit is to be an asset to the owner and brings him financial returns.\r\nThere are two destructive agencies against which he must make\r\nspecial efforts, fire and stock. It may seem unnecessary to point\r\nout the various bad effects which fire and stock have on woodlands,\r\nbut they are nevertheless here set forth in brief. =Fire= destroys\r\ntimber utterly, injures it so that it is subject to insect and fungi\r\nattacks, lowers the grade of the timber, destroys or seriously injures\r\nreproduction, destroys humus and lowers the productive capacity of the\r\nsoil. There is no way in which burning over a woodland improves the\r\ncharacter of the forest. =Stock= have a very injurious effect on trees,\r\nespecially young growth. Some stock eat up the nuts and berries and\r\nseeds which are the means of reproducing the forest. Other stock browse\r\non the young trees which have started, destroying the young growth\r\naltogether or seriously gnawing other trees thereby leaving them badly\r\nmalformed and depleted in vitality. By rubbing against small trees\r\nstock also do a great deal of harm. So stock should be rigidly excluded\r\nfrom the woodlot, or at least until all the trees are well developed\r\nand even then no good is accomplished. If possible, the woodlot should\r\nbe well fenced. The other destructive agencies against which protection\r\nmay become necessary are insects and disease. If fire and stock are\r\nexcluded, the chances of insects and disease doing serious damage is\r\nmaterially decreased. Diseases and insects are best kept in check by\r\nkeeping the wooded area clean of dead and decaying material. In case of\r\nserious insect infestation it may in some cases pay to spray the trees,\r\nbut under ordinary conditions this is not practical. The common way of\r\nfighting disease and insects is to cut down and burn all affected trees.\r\n\r\n2. =Taking of Stock.= The next step in the regeneration of our woodland\r\nis to find out the extent and character of the stock on hand, for we\r\ncan not proceed intelligently without this knowledge. This taking of\r\nstock may be a purely ocular process or it may be a detailed estimate\r\nand description, depending on the extent of the woodland and the\r\ndesires of the owner. All reproduction should be accounted for as\r\nwell as the older stock on hand. The taking of stock should also\r\ninvolve the division of species into desirable and undesirable species,\r\nby desirable species being meant such species as it is desired to\r\nencourage because of the demand for it in the local market or because\r\nof the use which may be made of it by the owner on his farm. The\r\ndesirable species will usually include the fast growing species.\r\n\r\n3. =Removal of Undesirable Species and Trees.= The first actual work\r\nin connection with the regeneration of the woodlot is the removal of\r\nundesirable species. When this is undertaken the local market and other\r\nmarkets should be carefully studied in order that, if possible, a sale\r\nmay be found for the material which is removed, so that the work may\r\npay for itself. In determining what are undesirable species there are\r\nseveral factors which will govern and no specific list of trees can be\r\ncited. The desire of the owner, the market for the material, rapidity\r\nof growth and other features are among the important considerations.\r\nSuch trees as blue beach, horn beam, red bud, service berry and others\r\nhave no rightful place in a woodlot since they take up space without\r\nfurnishing any product of value, unless the wooded area is desired for\r\nits aesthetic features. In a woodlot which is maintained for fence\r\nposts and fuel it would be poor policy to retain any but those species\r\nwhich make good fence post material and fuel and grow rapidly. In this\r\nmatter, common sense will go a long way. Also badly suppressed trees,\r\nmalformed and diseased or infected individuals should be removed as far\r\nas practicable.\r\n\r\n4. =Selection of Desirable Species.= In the selection of desirable\r\nspecies there are a large number of considerations, and the first of\r\nthese is the purpose of the owner in maintaining the woodlot. For\r\ninstance, if the owner desires fence posts, and fencing material, his\r\nwoodlot will, in Kentucky, be confined to those species which produce\r\nsuch material =quickly=, as for example black locust, catalpa, chestnut\r\nand walnut, also it will be well to have a percentage of red cedar\r\n(juniper) in the mixture, for since red cedar grows comparatively\r\nslowly, it may be reserved to be cut as the second crop and will serve\r\nto shade the ground and prevent erosion when the faster growing\r\nspecies have been cut and during the restocking of the area. If fuel as\r\nwell as fence post material is desired, a mixture including hickory,\r\noak and chestnut would be desirable. If ties, posts, poles or other\r\nproducts are an object, certain species are desirable and are easily\r\ngrown. A list of trees suitable for various purposes is herewith given.\r\nNo species are included in this list which will not produce marketable\r\nmaterial repeatedly within the lifetime of a single individual. Only\r\nin unusual cases is the raising of trees for lumber recommended as a\r\nfeasible or profitable venture for the individual farm owner.\r\n\r\nFence posts and fencing material――Black locust, catalpa, chestnut,\r\nwalnut, oak, red cedar (juniper).\r\n\r\nFuel――Oak, hickory, maple, chestnut.\r\n\r\nPoles――Chestnut, catalpa, red cedar.\r\n\r\nTies――Black locust, catalpa, chestnut, walnut, oak.\r\n\r\nVehicle material and handle stock――Hickory.\r\n\r\n5. =Methods of Regeneration.= There are several things which must be\r\ndone to secure a good forest over the area. If natural seeding is to\r\nbe depended upon for reproduction, the ground must be prepared to\r\nreceive the seed. Sometimes the sod will be so thick over the area\r\nthat seeds get no chance to generate. In this case, the sod should\r\nbe plowed up, if possible, or harrowed so that the seeds may have a\r\nsuitable opportunity to start. To do well, it is necessary that the\r\nseeds and seedlings have easy access to the mineral soil. It may\r\nbe that the ground is so shaded that seedlings do not receive the\r\nnecessary sunlight. If this be so, sufficiently large openings should\r\nbe made in the forest cover to admit the required light. It may be that\r\nnatural seeding does not proceed rapidly enough and that this must be\r\nsupplemented by the sowing of seed artificially. When artificial sowing\r\nis resorted to it will be found that there are several methods of\r\nsowing which recommend themselves: broadcast, sowing in prepared rows,\r\nsowing in prepared seed spots and sowing with a corn planter either in\r\nrows or spots. This last method is recommended as being usually most\r\nsatisfactory and economical. Sowing with a corn planter can be resorted\r\nto only in the case of small seeds. Large seeds, such as walnuts,\r\nhickory nuts, etc., must be planted by hand, but when this is done they\r\nare liable to be eaten by squirrels or other rodents, in which case it\r\nmay be necessary to plant such seeds in small protected seed beds and\r\nthen transplant the seedlings to the place where they are desired.\r\n\r\nIf planting is to be depended upon for reforesting, the nursery stock\r\nobtained should be small seedlings not over one or two years old or\r\ntransplants two to three years old. If the amount of planting to be\r\ndone is large, it may be wise to start seed beds close to the ground\r\nwhere the planting is to be done and not to depend on commercial\r\nnurseries for stock.\r\n\r\n6. =Care and Management.= It will be found that the care and management\r\nof the woodlot is relatively a simple matter after the forest is\r\nwell established and that the character of the stock and the amount\r\nand quality of the products will improve materially with management.\r\nThere are certain systems of management which recommend themselves\r\nfor woodlots such as the (1) simple coppice (2) pole wood coppice (3)\r\ncoppice with standards or variations of these. The three methods here\r\ncited are briefly described.\r\n\r\n=Simple Coppice.= This is a system of management wherein all the stand\r\nis cut and the restocking of the area is secured by sprouts from the\r\nold stumps. Under this system the stand should be cut at an age not to\r\nexceed twenty-five years and preferably about fifteen years, although\r\nthis is usually impossible from a commercial standpoint. The cutting\r\nshould be done in the late fall, winter or early spring. The stumps\r\nshould be cut low, smooth and slanting so as to shed water and prevent\r\ndecay. After a time under this system the sprouting capacity of the\r\nstump is greatly reduced and arrangement must be made to secure new\r\nindividuals either by direct seeding or by planting.\r\n\r\n=Pole Wood Coppice.= This system involves the leaving of certain trees\r\nuntil they reach the pole wood stage and are suitable for such products\r\nas ties, poles, etc. It is a favorite method of handling woodlots.\r\n\r\n=Pole Wood Standards.= This system involves the leaving of a certain\r\nfew trees until they are of large size. Such trees should usually be\r\nfrom the seed.\r\n\r\nIn the management of the woodland, it will be necessary to make several\r\ncuttings before the final cutting at the end of the rotation, usually\r\none or two. A thinning may early become necessary to give the best\r\nspecimens a better chance for growth. Sometimes two thinnings may be\r\nrequired. Often a thinning may be required to secure reproduction by\r\nopening up the forest cover and exposing the ground so that young\r\ngrowth may have the opportunity to get started.\r\n\r\nIn the final cutting, when all or the major part of the crop is cut,\r\nthe material should be removed from the ground as rapidly as possible\r\nand the brush disposed of when practical. The disposal of brush will\r\nusually take the form of lopping the limbs from the tops and scattering\r\nthem, so as to secure early decay of the waste material. Sometimes the\r\nbrush may be advantageously piled and burned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made in this bulletin to deal exhaustively with\r\nthe woodlot problem. The desire has been to point the way for the\r\nimprovement of the woodlots in Kentucky. Individual cases deserve\r\nspecific consideration, and only the main features of the proposition\r\nhave been touched upon. The State Forester will cheerfully answer by\r\nmail all questions relating to this subject so far as it is possible to\r\ndo so, and will give such personal advice and direction as the time at\r\nhis disposal and the circumstances warrant. A list of books, bulletins\r\nand articles treating this subject is appended for those who desire to\r\ngo more deeply into the matter than is possible in a publication of\r\nthis character.
