Roscoe, M.P. This was delivered in the Free\r\nTrade Hall. The chair was occupied by Professor Williamson, who was\r\nsupported by the Bishop of Manchester, Sir F. Bramwell, Professor\r\nGamgee, Professor Milnes Marshall, Professor Wilkins, Professor Boyd\r\nDawkins, Professor Ward, and many other distinguished men. A telegram\r\nwas read from the retiring president, Sir Wm. Dawson, of Montreal,\r\ncongratulating the association and Manchester on this year's meeting.\r\nThe new president, Sir H. Roscoe, having been introduced to the\r\naudience, was heartily applauded.\r\n\r\nThe president, in his inaugural address, said Manchester, distinguished\r\nas the birthplace of two of the greatest discoveries of modern science,\r\nwelcomed the visit of the British Association for the third time. Those\r\ndiscoveries were the atomic theory of which John Dalton was the author,\r\nand the most far-reaching scientific principle of modern times, namely,\r\nthat of the conservation of energy, which was given to the world about\r\nthe year 1842 by Dr. Joule. While the place suggested these reminders,\r\nthe time, the year of the Queen's jubilee, excited a feeling of\r\nthankfulness that they had lived in an age which had witnessed an\r\nadvance in our knowledge of nature and a consequent improvement in the\r\nphysical, moral, and intellectual well-being of the people hitherto\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nA sketch of that progress in the science of chemistry alone would be\r\nthe subject of his address. The initial point was the views of Dalton\r\nand his contemporaries compared with the ideas which now prevail; and\r\nhe (the president) examined this comparison by the light which the\r\nresearch of the last fifty years had thrown on the subject of the\r\nDaltonian atoms, in the three-fold aspect of their size,\r\nindivisibility, and mutual relationships, and their motions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF THE ATOM.\r\n\r\nAs to the size of the atom, Loschmidt, of Vienna, had come to the\r\nconclusion that the diameter of an atom of oxygen or nitrogen was the\r\nten-millionth part of a centimeter. With the highest known magnifying\r\npower we could distinguish the forty-thousandth part of a centimeter.\r\nIf, now, we imagine a cubic box each of whose sides had this length,\r\nsuch a box, when filled with air, would contain from sixty to a\r\nhundred millions of atoms of oxygen and nitrogen. As to the\r\nindivisibility of the atom, the space of fifty years had completely\r\nchanged the face of the inquiry. Not only had the number of distinct,\r\nwell-established elementary bodies increased from fifty-three in 1837\r\nto seventy in 1887, but the properties of these elements had been\r\nstudied, and were now known with a degree of precision then undreamt\r\nof. Had the atoms of our present elements been made to yield? To this\r\na negative answer must undoubtedly be given, for even the highest of\r\nterrestrial temperatures, that of the electric spark, had failed to\r\nshake any one of these atoms in two. This was shown by the results\r\nwith which spectrum analysis had enriched our knowledge. Terrestrial\r\nanalysis had failed to furnish favorable evidence; and, turning to the\r\nchemistry of the stars, the spectra of the white, which were\r\npresumably the hottest stars, furnished no direct evidence that a\r\ndecomposition of any terrestrial atom had taken place; indeed, we\r\nlearned that the hydrogen atom, as we know it here, can endure\r\nunscathed the inconceivably fierce temperature of stars presumably\r\nmany times more fervent than our sun, as Sirius and Vega. It was\r\ntherefore no matter for surprise if the earth-bound chemist should for\r\nthe present continue to regard the elements as the unalterable\r\nfoundation stones upon which his science is based.\r\n\r\n\r\nATOMIC MOTION.\r\n\r\nPassing to the consideration of atoms in motion, while Dalton and\r\nGraham indicated that they were in a continual state of motion, we\r\nwere indebted to Joule for the first accurate determination of the\r\nrate of that motion. Clerk-Maxwell had calculated that a hydrogen\r\nmolecule, moving at the rate of seventy miles per minute, must, in one\r\nsecond of time, knock against others no fewer than eighteen thousand\r\nmillion times. This led to the reflection that in nature there is no\r\nsuch thing as great or small, and that the structure of the smallest\r\nparticle, invisible even to our most searching vision, may be as\r\ncomplicated as that of any one of the heavenly bodies which circle\r\nround our sun. How did this wonderful atomic motion affect their\r\nchemistry?\r\n\r\n\r\nATOMIC COMBINATION.\r\n\r\nLavoisier left unexplained the dynamics of combustion; but in 1843,\r\nbefore the chemical section of the association meeting at Cork, Dr.\r\nJoule announced the discovery which was to revolutionize modern\r\nscience, namely, the determination of the mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat. Every change in the arrangement of the particles he found was\r\naccompanied by a definite evolution or an absorption of heat. Heat was\r\nevolved by the clashing of the atoms, and this amount was fixed and\r\ndefinite. Thus to Joule we owe the foundation of chemical dynamics and\r\nthe basis of thermal chemistry. It was upon a knowledge of the mode of\r\narrangement of atoms, and on a recognition of their distinctive\r\nproperties, that the superstructure of modern organic chemistry\r\nrested. We now assumed on good grounds that the atom of each element\r\npossessed distinct capabilities of combination. The knowledge of the\r\nmode in which the atoms in the molecule are arranged had given to\r\norganic chemistry an impetus which had overcome many experimental\r\nobstacles, and organic chemistry had now become synthetic.\r\n\r\nLiebig and Wohler, in 1837, foresaw the artificial production in the\r\nlaboratories of all organic substances so far as they did not\r\nconstitute a living organism. And after fifty years their prophecy had\r\nbeen fulfilled, for at the present time we could prepare an artificial\r\nsweetening principle, an artificial alkaloid, and salacine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTHESIS.\r\n\r\nWe know now that the same laws regulate the formation of chemical\r\ncompounds in both animate and inanimate nature, and the chemist only\r\nasked for a knowledge of the constitution of any definite chemical\r\ncompounds found in the organic world in order to be able to promise to\r\nprepare it artificially. Seventeen years elapsed between Wohler's\r\ndiscovery of the artificial production of urea and the next real\r\nsynthesis, which was accomplished by Kolbe, when in 1845 he prepared\r\nacetic acid from its elements. Since then a splendid harvest of\r\nresults had been gathered in by chemists of all nations. In 1834 Dumas\r\nmade known the law of substitution, and showed that an exchange could\r\ntake place between the constituent atoms in a molecule, and upon this\r\nlaw depended in great measure the astounding progress made in the wide\r\nfield of organic synthesis.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable result had been the production of an\r\nartificial sweetening agent, termed saccharin, 250 times sweeter than\r\nsugar, prepared by a complicated series of reactions from coal tar.\r\nThese discoveries were not only of scientific interest, for they had\r\ngiven rise to the industry of coal tar colors, founded by our\r\ncountryman Perkin, the value of which was measured by millions\r\nsterling annually. Another interesting application of synthetic\r\nchemistry to the needs of everyday life was the discovery of a series\r\nof valuable febrifuges, of which antipyrin might be named as the most\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect in connection with the study of these bodies was\r\nthe physiological value which had been found to attach to the\r\nintroduction of certain organic radicals, so that an indication was\r\ngiven of the possibility of preparing a compound which will possess\r\ncertain desired physiological properties, or even to foretell the kind\r\nof action which such bodies may exert on the animal economy. But now\r\nthe question might well be put, Was any limit set to this synthetic\r\npower of the chemist? Although the danger of dogmatizing as to the\r\nprogress of science had already been shown in too many instances, yet\r\none could not help feeling that the barrier between the organized and\r\nunorganized worlds was one which the chemist at present saw no chance\r\nof breaking down. True, there were those who professed to foresee that\r\nthe day would arrive when the chemist, by a succession of constructive\r\nefforts, might pass beyond albumen, and gather the elements of\r\nlifeless matter into a living structure. Whatever might be said\r\nregarding this from other standpoints, the chemist could only say that\r\nat present no such problem lay within his province.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm, with which the simplest manifestations of life are\r\nassociated, was not a compound, but a structure built up of compounds.\r\nThe chemist might successfully synthesize any of its component\r\nmolecules, but he had no more reason to look forward to the synthetic\r\nproduction of the structure than to imagine that the synthesis of\r\ngallic acid led to the artificial production of gall nuts. Although\r\nthere was thus no prospect of effecting a synthesis of organized\r\nmaterial, yet the progress made in our knowledge of the chemistry of\r\nlife during the last fifty years had been very great, so much so\r\nindeed that the sciences of physiological and of pathological\r\nchemistry might be said to have entirely arisen within that period.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY OF VITAL FUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\nHe would now briefly trace a few of the more important steps which had\r\nmarked the recent study of the relations between the vital phenomena\r\nand those of the inorganic world. No portion of the science of\r\nchemistry was of greater interest or greater complexity than that\r\nwhich, bearing on the vital functions both of plants and of animals,\r\nendeavored to unravel the tangled skein of the chemistry of life, and\r\nto explain the principles according to which our bodies live, and\r\nmove, and have their being. If, therefore, in the less complicated\r\nproblems with which other portions of our science have to deal, we\r\nfound ourselves often far from possessing satisfactory solutions, we\r\ncould not be surprised to learn that with regard to the chemistry of\r\nthe living body--whether vegetable or animal--in health or disease, we\r\nwere still farther from a complete knowledge of phenomena, even those\r\nof fundamental importance.\r\n\r\nLiebig asked if we could distinguish, on the one hand, between the\r\nkind of food which goes to create warmth and, on the other, that by\r\nthe oxidation of which the motions and mechanical energy of the body\r\nare kept up. He thought he was able to do this, and he divided food\r\ninto two categories. The starchy or carbo-hydrate food was that, said\r\nhe, which by its combustion provided the warmth necessary for the\r\nexistence and life of the body. The albuminous or nitrogenous\r\nconstituents of our food, the flesh meat, the gluten, the casein out\r\nof which our muscles are built up, were not available for the purpose\r\nof creating warmth, but it was by the waste of those muscles that the\r\nmechanical energy, the activity, the motions of the animal are\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nSoon after the promulgation of these views, J.R. Mayer warmly attacked\r\nthem, throwing out the hypothesis that all muscular action is due to\r\nthe combustion of food, and not to the destruction of muscle.\r\n\r\nWhat did modern research say to this question? Could it be brought to\r\nthe crucial test of experiment? It could; but how? In the first place,\r\nwe could ascertain the work done by a man or any other animal; we\r\ncould measure this work in terms of our mechanical standard, in\r\nkilogramme-meters or foot-pounds. We could next determine what was the\r\ndestruction of nitrogenous tissue at rest and under exercise by the\r\namount of nitrogenous material thrown off by the body. And here we\r\nmust remember that these tissues were never completely burned, so that\r\nfree nitrogen was never eliminated. If now we knew the heat value of\r\nthe burned muscle, it was easy to convert this into its mechanical\r\nequivalent and thus measure the energy generated. What was the result?\r\n\r\nWas the weight of muscle destroyed by ascending the Faulhorn or by\r\nworking on the treadmill sufficient to produce on combustion heat\r\nenough when transformed into mechanical exercise to lift the body up\r\nto the summit of the Faulhorn or to do the work on the treadmill?\r\n\r\nCareful experiment had shown that this was so far from being the case\r\nthat the actual energy developed was twice as great as that which\r\ncould possibly be produced by the oxidation of the nitrogenous\r\nconstituents eliminated from the body during twenty-four hours. That\r\nwas to say, taking the amount of nitrogenous substance cast off from\r\nthe body, not only while the work was being done, but during\r\ntwenty-four hours, the mechanical effect capable of being produced by\r\nthe muscular tissue from which this cast-off material was derived\r\nwould only raise the body half way up the Faulhorn, or enable the\r\nprisoner to work half his time on the treadmill. Hence it was clear\r\nthat Liebig's proposition was not true.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenous constituents of the food did doubtless go to repair\r\nthe waste of muscle, which, like every other portion of the body,\r\nneeded renewal, while the function of the non-nitrogenous food was not\r\nonly to supply the animal heat, but also to furnish, by its oxidation,\r\nthe muscular energy of the body. We thus came to the conclusion that\r\nit was the potential energy of the food which furnished the actual\r\nenergy of the body, expressed in terms either of heat or of mechanical\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut there was one other factor which came into play in this question\r\nof mechanical energy, and must be taken into account; and this factor\r\nwe were as yet unable to estimate in our usual terms. It concerned the\r\naction of the mind on the body, and although incapable of exact\r\nexpression, exerted none the less an important influence on the\r\nphysics and chemistry of the body, so that a connection undoubtedly\r\nexisted between intellectual activity or mental work and bodily\r\nnutrition. What was the expenditure of mechanical energy which\r\naccompanied mental effort was a question which science was probably\r\nfar from answering; but that the body experienced exhaustion as the\r\nresult of mental activity was a well-recognized fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY OF VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of vegetation, no less than those of the animal world,\r\nhad, however, during the last fifty years been placed by the chemist\r\non an entirely new basis.\r\n\r\nLiebig, in 1860, asserted that the whole of the carbon of vegetation\r\nwas obtained from the atmospheric carbonic acid, which, though only\r\npresent in the small relative proportion of four parts in 10,000 of\r\nair, was contained in such absolutely large quantity that if all the\r\nvegetation on the earth's surface were burned, the proportion of\r\ncarbonic acid which would thus be thrown into the air would not be\r\nsufficient to double the present amount. That this conclusion was\r\ncorrect needed experimental proof, but such proof could only be given\r\nby long-continued and laborious experiment.\r\n\r\nIt was to our English agricultural chemists, Lawes and Gilbert, that\r\nwe owed the complete experimental proof required, and this experiment\r\nwas long and tedious, for it had taken forty-four years to give a\r\ndefinite reply.\r\n\r\nAt Rothamsted a plot was set apart for the growth of wheat. For\r\nforty-four successive years that field had grown wheat without the\r\naddition of any carbonized manure, so that the only possible source\r\nfrom which the plant could obtain the carbon for its growth was the\r\natmospheric carbonic acid. The quantity of carbon which on an average\r\nwas removed in the form of wheat and straw from a plot manured only\r\nwith mineral matter was 1,000 lb., while on another plot, for which a\r\nnitrogenous manure was employed, 1,500 lb. more carbon was annually\r\nremoved, or 2,500 lb. of carbon were removed by this crop annually\r\nwithout the addition of any carbonaceous manure. So that Liebig's\r\nprevision had received a complete experimental verification.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL PATHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nTouching us as human beings even still more closely than the foregoing\r\nwas the influence which chemistry had exerted on the science of\r\npathology, and in no direction had greater progress been made than in\r\nthe study of micro-organisms in relation to health and disease. In the\r\ncomplicated chemical changes to which we gave the names of\r\nfermentation and putrefaction, Pasteur had established the fundamental\r\nprinciple that these processes were inseparately connected with the\r\nlife of certain low forms of organisms. Thus was founded the science\r\nof bacteriology, which in Lister's hands had yielded such splendid\r\nresults in the treatment of surgical cases, and in those of Klebs,\r\nKoch, and others, had been the means of detecting the cause of many\r\ndiseases both in man and animals, the latest and not the least\r\nimportant of which was the remarkable series of successful researches\r\nby Pasteur into the nature and mode of cure of that most dreadful of\r\nmaladies, hydrophobia. The value of his discovery was greater than\r\ncould be estimated by its present utility, for it showed that it might\r\nbe possible to avert other diseases besides hydrophobia by the\r\nadoption of a somewhat similar method of investigation and of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nHere it might seem as if we had outstepped the boundaries of\r\nchemistry, and had to do with phenomena purely vital. But recent\r\nresearch indicated that this was not the case, and pointed to the\r\nconclusion that the microscopist must again give way to the chemist,\r\nand that it was by chemical rather than biological investigation that\r\nthe causes of diseases would be discovered, and the power of removing\r\nthem obtained. For we learned that the symptoms of infective diseases\r\nwere no more due to the microbes which constituted the infection than\r\nalcoholic intoxication was produced by the yeast cell, but that these\r\nsymptoms were due to the presence of definite chemical compounds, the\r\nresult of the life of these microscopic organisms. So it was to the\r\naction of these poisonous substances formed during the life of the\r\norganism, rather than to that of the organism itself, that the special\r\ncharacteristics of the disease were to be traced, for it had been\r\nshown that the disease could be communicated by such poisons in the\r\nentire absence of living organisms.\r\n\r\nHad time permitted, he would have wished to have illustrated the\r\ndependence of industrial success upon original investigation, and to\r\nhave pointed out the prodigious strides which chemical industry in\r\nthis country had made during the fifty years of her Majesty's reign.\r\nAs it was, he must be content to remark how much our modern life, both\r\nin its artistic and useful aspects, owed to chemistry, and therefore\r\nhow essential a knowledge of the principles of the science was to all\r\nwho had the industrial progress of the country at heart. The country\r\nwas now beginning to see that if she was to maintain her commercial\r\nand industrial supremacy, the education of her people from top to\r\nbottom must be carried out on new lines. The question how this could\r\nbe most safely and surely accomplished was one of transcendent\r\nnational importance, and the statesman who solved this educational\r\nproblem would earn the gratitude of generations yet to come.\r\n\r\nIn welcoming the unprecedentedly large number of foreign men of\r\nscience who had on this occasion honored the British Association by\r\ntheir presence, he hoped that that meeting might be the commencement\r\nof an international scientific organization, the only means nowadays\r\nexisting of establishing that fraternity among nations from which\r\npolitics appeared to remove them further and further, by absorbing\r\nhuman powers and human work, and directing them to purposes of\r\ndestruction. It would indeed be well if Great Britain, which had\r\nhitherto taken the lead in so many things that are great and good,\r\nshould now direct her attention to the furthering of international\r\norganizations of a scientific nature. A more appropriate occasion than\r\nthe present meeting could perhaps hardly be found for the inauguration\r\nof such a movement. But whether this hope were realized or not, they\r\nall united in that one great object, the search after truth for its\r\nown sake, and they all, therefore, might join in re-echoing the words\r\nof Lessing: \"The worth of man lies not in the truth which he\r\npossesses, or believes that he possesses, but in the honest endeavor\r\nwhich he puts forth to secure that truth; for not by the possession of\r\ntruth, but by the search after it, are the faculties of man enlarged,\r\nand in this alone consists his ever-growing perfection. Possession\r\nfosters content, indolence, and pride. If God should hold in his right\r\nhand all truth, and in his left hand the ever-active desire to seek\r\ntruth, though with the condition of perpetual error, I would humbly\r\nask for the contents of the left hand, saying, 'Father, give me this;\r\npure truth is only for thee.'\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of his address a vote of thanks was passed to the\r\npresident, on the motion of the Mayor of Manchester, seconded by\r\nProfessor Asa Gray, of Harvard College. The president mentioned that\r\nthe number of members is already larger than at any previous annual\r\nmeeting, namely, 3,568, including eighty foreigners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRIMSON LINE OF PHOSPHORESCENT ALUMINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrookes has presented to the Royal Society a paper on the color\r\nemitted by pure alumina when submitted to the electric discharge _in\r\nvacuo_, in answer to the statements of De Boisbaudran. In 1879 he had\r\nstated that \"next to the diamond, alumina, in the form of ruby, is\r\nperhaps the most strikingly phosphorescent stone I have examined. It\r\nglows with a rich, full red; and a remarkable feature is that it is of\r\nlittle consequence what degree of color the earth or stone possesses\r\nnaturally, the color of the phosphorescence is nearly the same in all\r\ncases; chemically precipitated amorphous alumina, rubies of a pale\r\nreddish yellow, and gems of the prized 'pigeon's blood' color glowing\r\nalike in the vacuum.\" These results, as well as the spectra obtained,\r\nhe stated further, corroborated Becquerel's observations. In\r\nconsequence of the opposite results obtained by De Boisbaudran,\r\nCrookes has now re-examined this question with a view to clear up the\r\nmystery. On examining a specimen of alumina prepared from tolerably\r\npure aluminum sulphate, shown by the ordinary tests to be free from\r\nchromium, the bright crimson line, to which the red phosphorescent\r\nlight is due, was brightly visible in its spectrum. The aluminum\r\nsulphate was then, in separate portions, purified by various processes\r\nespecially adapted to separate from it any chromium that might be\r\npresent; the best of these being that given by Wohler, solution in\r\nexcess of potassium hydrate and precipitation of the alumina by a\r\ncurrent of chlorine. The alumina filtered off, ignited, and tested in\r\na radiant matter tube gave as good a crimson line spectrum as did that\r\nfrom the original sulphate.\r\n\r\nA repetition of this purifying process gave no change in the result.\r\nFour possible explanations are offered of the phenomena observed: \"(1)\r\nThe crimson line is due to alumina, but it is capable of being\r\nsuppressed by an accompanying earth which concentrates toward one end\r\nof the fractionations; (2) the crimson line is not due to alumina, but\r\nis due to the presence of an accompanying earth concentrating toward\r\nthe other end of the fractionations; (3) the crimson line belongs to\r\nalumina, but its full development requires certain precautions to be\r\nobserved in the time and intensity of ignition, degree of exhaustion,\r\nor its absolute freedom from alkaline and other bodies carried down by\r\nprecipitated alumina and difficult to remove by washing; experience\r\nnot having yet shown which of these precautions are essential to the\r\nfull development of the crimson line and which are unessential; and\r\n(4) the earth alumina is a compound molecule, one of its constituent\r\nmolecules giving the crimson line. According to this hypothesis,\r\nalumina would be analogous to yttria.\"--_Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIC ACID IN THE AIR.\r\n\r\nBy THOMAS C. VAN NUYS and BENJAMIN F. ADAMS, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the month of April, 1886, we made eighteen estimations of\r\ncarbonic acid in the air, employing Van Nuys' apparatus,[1] recently\r\ndescribed in this journal. These estimations were made in the\r\nUniversity Park, one-half mile from the town of Bloomington. The park\r\nis hilly, thinly shaded, and higher than the surrounding country. The\r\nformation is sub-carboniferous and altitude 228 meters. There are no\r\nlowlands or swamps near. The estimations were made at 10 A.M.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: See SCI. AM. SUPPLEMENT No. 577.]\r\n\r\nThe air was obtained one-half meter from the ground and about 100\r\nmeters from any of the university buildings. The number of volumes of\r\ncarbonic acid is calculated at zero C. and normal pressure 760 mm.\r\n\r\n  --------+----------+--------------+------------------------\r\n          |          | Vols.

Reiset[2] made a great number of estimations from\r\nSeptember 9, 1872, to August 20, 1873, the average of which is 29.42.\r\nSix years later[3] he made many estimations from June to November, the\r\naverage of which is 29.78. The average of Schultze's[4] estimations is\r\n29 2. The results of estimations of carbonic acid in the air, made\r\nunder the supervision of Munz and Aubin[5] in October, November, and\r\nDecember, 1882, at the stations where observations were made of the\r\ntransit of Venus by astronomers sent out by the French government,\r\nyield the average, for all stations north of the equator to latitude\r\n29° 54' in Florida, 28.2 volumes carbonic acid in 100,000 volumes air,\r\nand for all stations south of the equator 27.1 volumes. The average of\r\nClaesson's[6] estimations is 27.9 volumes, his maximum number is 32.7,\r\nand his minimum is 23.7. It is apparent, from the results of\r\nestimations of carbonic acid of the air of various parts of the globe,\r\nby the employment of apparatus with which errors are avoided, that the\r\nquantity of carbonic acid is subject to slight variation, and not, as\r\nstated in nearly all text books of science, from 4 to 6 volumes in\r\n10,000 volumes of air; and it is further apparent that the law of\r\nSchloesing[7] holds good. By this law the carbonic acid of an\r\natmosphere in contact with water containing calcium or magnesium\r\ncarbonate in solution is dissolved according to the tension of the\r\ncarbonic acid; that is, by an increased quantity its tension\r\nincreases, and more would pass in solution in the form of\r\nbicarbonates. On the other hand, by diminishing the quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid in the atmosphere, some of the bicarbonates would\r\ndecompose and carbonic acid pass into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: Comptes Rendus, 88, 1007.]\r\n  [Footnote 3: Comptes Rendus, 90, 1144.]\r\n  [Footnote 4: Chem.

Engel[8].\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 8: Comptes Rendus, 101, 949.]\r\n\r\nThe results of estimations of bases and carbonic acid in the water of\r\nthe English Channel lead Schloesing[9] to conclude that the carbonic\r\nacid combined with normal carbonates, forming bicarbonates, dissolved\r\nin the water of the globe is ten times greater in quantity than that\r\nof the atmosphere, and on account of this available carbonic acid, if\r\nthe atmosphere should be deprived of some of its carbonic acid, the\r\nloss would soon be supplied.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 9: Comptes Rendus, 90, 1410.]\r\n\r\nAs, in nearly all of the methods which were employed for estimating\r\ncarbonic acid in the air, provision is not made for the exclusion of\r\nair not measured containing carbonic acid from the alkaline fluid\r\nbefore titrating or weighing, the results are generally too high and\r\nshow a far greater variation than is found by more exact methods. For\r\nexample, Gilm[10] found from 36 to 48 volumes; Levy's[11] average is\r\n34 volumes; De Luna's[12] 50 volumes; and Fodor's,[13] 38.9 volumes.\r\nAdmitting that the quantity of carbonic acid in the air is subject to\r\nvariation, yet the results of Reiset's and Schultze's estimations go\r\nto prove that the variation is within narrow limits.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 10: Sitzungsher. d.

SEARLES, Chairman of the Committee, Civil Engineers' Club\r\nof Cleveland, O.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the wonderful development of our steel industries in\r\nthe last decade, the improvements in the modes of manufacture, and the\r\nundoubted strength of the metal under certain circumstances,\r\nnevertheless we find that steel has not altogether met the\r\nrequirements of engineers as a structural material. Although its\r\nbreaking strain and elastic limit are higher than those of wrought\r\niron, the latter metal is frequently preferred and selected for\r\ntensile members, even when steel is used under compression in the same\r\nstructure. The Niagara cantilever bridge is a notable instance of this\r\npractice. When steel is used in tension its working strains are not\r\nallowed to be over fifty per cent. above those adopted for wrought\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the suspicion with which steel is regarded are well\r\nunderstood. Not only is there a lack of uniformity in the product, but\r\napparently the same steel will manifest very different results under\r\nslight provocation. Steel is very sensitive, not only to slight\r\nchanges in chemical composition, but also to mechanical treatment,\r\nsuch as straightening, bending, punching, planing, heating, etc.\r\nInitial strains may be developed by any of these processes that would\r\nseriously affect the efficiency of the metal in service.\r\n\r\nAmong the steels, those that are softer are more serviceable and\r\nreliable than the harder ones, especially whereever shocks and\r\nconcussions or rapidly alternating strains are to be endured. In other\r\nwords, the more nearly steel resembles good wrought iron, the more\r\ncertain it is to render lasting service when used within appropriate\r\nlimits of strain. Indeed, a wrought iron of fine quality is better\r\ncalculated to endure fatigue than any steel. This is particularly\r\nnoticeable in steam hammer pistons, propeller shafts, and railroad\r\naxles. A better quality of wrought iron, therefore, has long been a\r\ndesideratum, and it appears now that it has at last been found.\r\n\r\nSeveral years since, a pneumatic process of manufacturing wrought iron\r\nwas invented and patented by Dr. Chapin, and an experimental plant was\r\nerected near Chicago. Enough was done to demonstrate, first, that an\r\niron of unprecedentedly good qualities was attainable from common pig;\r\nand second, that the cost of its manufacture would not exceed that of\r\nBessemer steel. Nevertheless, owing to lack of funds properly to push\r\nthe invention against the jealous opposition which it encountered, the\r\nenterprise came to a halt until quite recently, when its merits found\r\na champion in Gustav Lindenthal, C.E., member of this club, who is\r\nnow the general manager of the Chapin Pneumatic Iron Co., and under\r\nwhose direction this new quality of iron will soon be put upon the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe process of manufacture is briefly as follows: The pig metal, after\r\nbeing melted in a cupola and tapped into a discharging ladle, is\r\ndelivered into a Bessemer converter, in which the metal is largely\r\nrelieved of its silicon, sulphur, carbon, etc., by the ordinary\r\npneumatic process. At the end of the blow the converter is turned down\r\nand its contents discharged into a traveling ladle, and quickly\r\ndelivered to machines called ballers, which are rotary reverberatory\r\nfurnaces, each revolving on a horizontal axis. In the baller the iron\r\nis very soon made into a ball without manual aid. It is then lifted\r\nout by means of a suspended fork and carried to a Winslow squeezer,\r\nwhere the ball is reduced to a roll twelve inches in diameter. Thence\r\nit is taken to a furnace for a wash heat, and finally to the muck\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nNo reagents are employed, as in steel making or ordinary iron\r\npuddling. The high heat of the metal is sufficient to preserve its\r\nfluidity during its transit from the converter to the baller; and the\r\ncinder from the blow is kept in the ladle.\r\n\r\nThe baller is a bulging cylinder having hollow trunnions through which\r\nthe flame passes. The cylinder is lined with fire brick, and this in\r\nturn is covered with a suitable refractory iron ore, from eight to ten\r\ninches thick, grouted with pulverized iron ore, forming a bottom, as\r\nin the common puddling furnace. The phosphorus of the iron, which\r\ncannot be eliminated in the intense heat of the converter, is,\r\nhowever, reduced to a minimum in the baller at a much lower\r\ntemperature and on the basic lining. The process wastes the lining\r\nvery slightly indeed. As many as sixty heats have been taken off in\r\nsuccession without giving the lining any attention. The absence of any\r\nreagent leaves the iron simply pure and homogeneous to a degree never\r\nrealized in muck bars made by the old puddling process. Thus the\r\nexpense of a reheating and rerolling to refine the iron is obviated.\r\nIt was such iron as here results that Bessemer, in his early\r\nexperiments, was seeking to obtain when he was diverted from his\r\npurpose by his splendid discoveries in the art of making steel. So\r\neffective is the new process, that even from the poorest grades of pig\r\nmay be obtained economically an iron equal in quality to the refined\r\nirons made from the best pig by the ordinary process of puddling.\r\n\r\nNumerous tests of the Chapin irons have been made by competent and\r\ndisinterested parties, and the results published. The samples here\r\nnoted were cut and piled only once from the muck bar.\r\n\r\nSample A was made from No. 3 mill cinder pig.\r\n\r\nSample B was made from No. 4 mill pig and No. 3 Bessemer pig, half and\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nSample C was made from No. 3 Bessemer pig, with the following results:\r\n\r\n            Sample.                 A         B         C\r\n  Tensile strength per sq. in.    56,000    60,772    64,377\r\n  Elastic limit.                  34,000      ....    36,000\r\n  Extension, per cent.              11.8      ....      17.0\r\n  Reduction of area, per cent.      65.0      16.0      33.0\r\n\r\nThe tensile strength of these irons made by ordinary puddling would be\r\nabout 38,000, 40,000, and 42,000 respectively, or the gain of the iron\r\nin tensile strength by the Chapin process is about fifty per cent. Not\r\nonly so, but these irons made in this manner from inferior pig show a\r\nhigher elastic limit and breaking strain than are commonly specified\r\nfor refined iron of best quality. The usual specifications are for\r\nrefined iron: Tensile strength, 50,000; elongation, 15 per cent.;\r\nelastic limit, 26,000; reduction, 25 cent.\r\n\r\nThus the limits of the Chapin iron are from 12 to 20 per cent. above\r\nthose of refined iron, and not far below those of structural steel,\r\nwhile there is a saving of some four dollars per ton in the price of\r\nthe pig iron from which it can be made. When made from the best pig\r\nmetal its breaking and elastic limits will probably reach 70,000 and\r\n40,000 pounds respectively. If so, it will be a safer material than\r\nsteel under the same working strains, owing to its greater resilience.\r\n\r\nSuch results are very interesting in both a mechanical and economical\r\npoint of view. Engineers will hail with delight the accession to the\r\nlist of available building materials of a wrought iron at once fine,\r\nfibrous, homogeneous, ductile, easily weldable, not subject to injury\r\nby the ordinary processes of shaping, punching, etc., and having a\r\ntensile strength and elastic limit nearly equal to any steel that\r\ncould safely be used in the same situation.\r\n\r\nA plant for the manufacture of Chapin iron is now in course of\r\nerection at Bethlehem, Pa., and there is every reason to believe that\r\nthe excellent results attained in Chicago will be more than reached in\r\nthe new works.--_Proceed.

Alexander Parkes, an Englishman, invented this remarkable\r\nsubstance in 1855, but after twelve years quit making it because of\r\ndifficulties in manipulation, although he made a fine display at the\r\nParis Exposition of 1867. Daniel Spill, also of England, began\r\nexperiments two years after Parkes, but a patent of his for dissolving\r\nthe nitrated wood fiber, or \"pyroxyline,\" in alcohol and camphor was\r\ndecided by Judge Blatchford in a suit brought against the Celluloid\r\nManufacturing Company to be valueless. No further progress was made\r\nuntil the Hyatt Brothers, of Albany, N.Y., discovered that gum\r\ncamphor, when finely divided, mixed with the nitrated fiber and then\r\nheated, is a perfect solvent, giving a homogeneous and plastic mass.\r\nAmerican patents of 1870 and 1874 are substantially identical with\r\nthose now in use in England. In France there is only one factory, and\r\nthere is none elsewhere on the Continent, one in Hanover having been\r\ngiven up on account of the explosive nature of the stuff. In this\r\ncountry pure cellulose is commonly obtained from paper makers, in the\r\nform of tissue paper, in wide rolls; this, after being nitrated by a\r\nbath of mixed nitric and sulphuric acids, is thoroughly washed and\r\npartially dried. Camphor is then added, and the whole is ground\r\ntogether and thoroughly mixed. At this stage coloring matter may be\r\nput in. A little alcohol increases the plasticity of the mass, which\r\nis then treated for some time to powerful hydraulic pressure. Then\r\ncomes breaking up the cakes and feeding the fragments between heated\r\nrolls, by which the amalgamation of the whole is completed. Its\r\nperfect plasticity allows it to be rolled into sheets, drawn into\r\ntubes, or moulded into any desired shape.--_Jewelers' Journal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR TESTING CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES AND CORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. J. Salleron has devised several apparatus which are destined to\r\nrender valuable service in the champagne industry. The apparently\r\nsimple operation of confining the carbonic acid due to fermentation in\r\na bottle in order to blow the cork from the latter with force at a\r\ngiven moment is not always successful, notwithstanding the skill and\r\nexperience of the manipulator. How could it be otherwise?\r\n\r\nEverything connected with the production of champagne wine was but\r\nrecently unknown and unexplained. The proportioning of the sugar\r\naccurately dates, as it were, from but yesterday, and the measurement\r\nof the absorbing power of wine for carbonic acid has but just entered\r\ninto practice, thanks to Mr. Salleron's absorptiometer. The real\r\nstrength of the bottles, and the laws of the elasticity of glass and\r\nits variation with the temperature, are but little known. Finally, the\r\nphysical constitution of cork, its chemical composition, its\r\nresistance to compression and the dissolving action of the wine, must\r\nbe taken into consideration. In fact, all the elements of the\r\ndifficult problem of the manufacture of sparkling wine show that there\r\nis an urgent necessity of introducing scientific methods into this\r\nindustry, as without them work can now no longer be done.\r\n\r\nNo one has had a better opportunity to show how easy it is to convert\r\nthe juice of the grape into sparkling wine through a series of simple\r\noperations whose details are known and accurately determined, so we\r\nbelieve it our duty to recommend those of our readers who are\r\nparticularly interested in this subject to read Mr. Salleron's book on\r\nsparkling wine. We shall confine ourselves in this article to a\r\ndescription of two of the apparatus invented by the author for testing\r\nthe resistance of bottles and cork stoppers.\r\n\r\nIt is well, in the first place, to say that one of the important\r\nelements in the treatment of sparkling wine is the normal pressure\r\nthat it is to produce in the bottles. After judicious deductions and\r\nnumerous experiments, Mr. Salleron has adopted for the normal pressure\r\nof highly sparkling wines five atmospheres at the temperature of the\r\ncellar, which does not exceed 10 degrees. But, in a defective cellar,\r\nthe bottles may be exposed to frost in winter and to a temperature of\r\n25° in summer, corresponding to a tension of ten atmospheres. It may\r\nnaturally be asked whether bottles will withstand such an ordeal. Mr.\r\nSalleron has determined their resistance through the process by which\r\nwe estimate that of building materials, viz., by measuring the limit\r\nof their elasticity, or, in other words, the pressure under which they\r\ntake on a new permanent volume. In fact, glass must be assimilated to\r\na perfectly elastic body; and bottles expand under the internal\r\npressure that they support. If their resistance is insufficient, they\r\ncontinue to increase in measure as the pressure is further prolonged,\r\nand at every increase in permanent capacity, their resistance\r\ndiminishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--MACHINE FOR TESTING BOTTLES.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus shown in Fig. 1 is called an elasticimeter, and permits\r\nof a preliminary testing of bottles. The bottle to be tested is put\r\ninto the receptacle, A B, which is kept full of water, and when it has\r\nbecome full, its neck is played between the jaws of the clamp, _p_.\r\nUpon turning the hand wheel, L, the bottle and the receptacle that\r\nholds it are lifted, and the mouth of the bottle presses against a\r\nrubber disk fixed under the support, C D. The pressure of the neck of\r\nthe bottle against this disk is such that the closing is absolutely\r\nhermetical. The support, C D, contains an aperture which allows the\r\ninterior of the bottle to communicate with a glass tube, _a b_, which\r\nthus forms a prolongation of the neck of the bottle. This tube is very\r\nnarrow and is divided into fiftieths of a cubic centimeter. A\r\nmicroscope, _m_, fixed in front of the tube, magnifies the divisions,\r\nand allows the position of the level of the water to be ascertained to\r\nwithin about a millionth of a cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nA force and suction pump, P, sucks in air through the tube, _t_, and\r\ncompresses it through the tube, _t'_, in the copper tube, T, which\r\ncommunicates with the glass tube, _a b_, after passing through the\r\npressure gauge, M. This pump, then, compresses the air in the bottle,\r\nand the gauge accurately measures its pressure.\r\n\r\nTo make a test, after the bottle full of water has been fastened under\r\nthe support, C D, the cock, _s_, is opened and the liquid with which\r\nthe small reservoir, R, has been filled flows through an aperture above\r\nthe mouth of the bottle and rises in the tube, _a b_. When its level\r\nreaches the division, O, the cock, _s_, is closed. The bottle and its\r\nprolongation, _a b_, are now exactly full of water without any air\r\nbubbles.\r\n\r\nThe pump is actuated, and, in measure as the pressure rises, the level\r\nof the liquid in the tube, _a b_, is seen to descend. This descent\r\nmeasures the expansion or flexion of the bottle as well as the\r\ncompression of the water itself. When the pressure is judged to be\r\nsufficient, the button, _n_, is turned, and the air compressed by the\r\npump finding an exit, the needle of the pressure gauge will be seen to\r\nredescend and the level of the tube, _a b_, to rise.\r\n\r\nIf the glass of the bottle has undergone no permanent deformation, the\r\nlevel will rise exactly to the zero mark, and denote that the bottle\r\nhas supported the test without any modification of its structure. But\r\nif, on the contrary, the level does not return to the zero mark, the\r\nlimit of the glass's elasticity has been extended, its molecules have\r\ntaken on a new state of equilibrium, and its resistance has\r\ndiminished, and, even if it has not broken, it is absolutely certain\r\nthat it has lost its former resistance and that it presents no\r\nparticular guarantee of strength.\r\n\r\nThe vessel, A B, which must be always full of water, is designed to\r\nkeep the bottle at a constant temperature during the course of the\r\nexperiment. This is an essential condition, since the bottle thus\r\nfilled with water constitutes a genuine thermometer, of which _a b_ is\r\nthe graduated tube. It is therefore necessary to avoid attributing a\r\nvariation in level due to an expansion of the water produced by a\r\nchange in temperature, to a deformation of the bottle.\r\n\r\nThe test, then, that can be made with bottles by means of the\r\nelasticimeter consists in compressing them to a pressure of ten\r\natmospheres when filled with water at a temperature of 25°, and in\r\nfinding out whether, under such a stress, they change their volume\r\npermanently. In order that the elasticimeter may not be complicated by\r\na special heating apparatus, it suffices to determine once for all\r\nwhat the pressure is that, at a mean temperature of 15°, acts upon\r\nbottles with the same energy as that of ten atmospheres at 25°.\r\nExperiment has demonstrated that such stress corresponds to twelve\r\natmospheres in a space in which the temperature remains about 15°.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the elasticimeter is capable of giving other and no less\r\nuseful data. It permits of comparing the resistance of bottles and of\r\nclassifying them according to the degree of such resistance. After\r\nnumerous experiments, it has been found that first class bottles\r\neasily support a pressure of twelve atmospheres without distortion,\r\nwhile in those of an inferior quality the resistance is very variable.\r\nThe champagne wine industry should therefore use the former\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\nVarious precautions must be taken in the use of corks. The bottles\r\nthat lose their wine in consequence of the bad quality of their corks\r\nare many in number, and it is not long since that they were the cause\r\nof genuine disaster to the champagne trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Salleron has largely contributed to the improving of the quality\r\nof corks found in the market. The physical and chemical composition of\r\ncork bark is peculiarly favorable to the special use to which it is\r\napplied; but the champagne wine industry requires of it an exaggerated\r\ndegree of resistance, inalterability, and elasticity. A 1¼ inch cork\r\nmust, under the action of a powerful machine, enter a ¾ inch neck,\r\nsupport the dissolving action of a liquid containing 12 per cent. of\r\nalcohol compressed to at least five atmospheres, and, in a few years,\r\nshoot out of the bottle and assume its pristine form and color. Out of\r\na hundred corks of good quality, not more than ten support such a\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain wherein resides the quality of cork, it is\r\nnecessary to refer to a chemical analysis of it. In cork bark there is\r\n70 per cent. of suberine, which is soluble in alcohol and ether, and\r\nis plastic, ductile, and malleable under the action of humid heat.\r\nMixed with suberine, cerine and resin give cork its insolubility and\r\ninalterability. These substances are soluble in alcohol and ether, but\r\ninsoluble in water.\r\n\r\nAccording to the origin of cork, the wax and resin exist in it in very\r\nvariable proportion. The more resinous kinds resist the dissolving\r\naction of wine better than those that are but slightly resinous. The\r\nlatter soon become corroded and spoiled by wine. An attempt has often\r\nbeen made, but without success, to improve poor corks by impregnating\r\nthem with the resinous principle that they lack.\r\n\r\nVarious other processes have been tried without success, and so it\r\nfinally became necessary simply to separate the good from the bad\r\ncorks by a practical and rapid operation. A simple examination does\r\nnot suffice. Mr. Bouché has found that corks immersed in water finally\r\nbecame covered with brown spots, and, by analogy, in order to test\r\ncorks, he immersed them in water for a fortnight or a month. All those\r\nthat came out spotted were rejected. Under the prolonged action of\r\nmoisture, the suberine becomes soft, and, if it is not resinous\r\nenough, the cells of the external layer of the cork burst, the water\r\nenters, and the cork becomes spotted.\r\n\r\nIt was left to Mr. Salleron to render the method of testing practical.\r\nHe compresses the cork in a very strong reservoir filled with water\r\nunder a pressure of from four to five atmospheres. By this means, the\r\nbut slightly resinous cork is quickly dissolved, so that, after a few\r\nhours' immersion, the bad corks come out spotted and channeled as if\r\nthey had been in the neck of a bottle for six months. On the contrary,\r\ngood corks resist the operation, and come out of the reservoir as\r\nwhite and firm as they were when they were put into it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--SALLERON'S APPARATUS FOR TESTING CORKS.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 gives a perspective view of Mr. Salleron's apparatus for\r\ntesting corks. A reservoir, A B, of tinned copper, capable of holding\r\n100 corks, is provided with a cover firmly held in place by a clamp.\r\nInto the cover is screwed a pressure gauge, M, which measures the\r\ninternal pressure of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nA pump, P, sucks water from a vessel through the tubulure, _t'_, and\r\nforces it through the tubulure, _t_, into the reservoir full of corks.\r\nAfter being submitted to a pressure of five atmospheres in this\r\napparatus for a few hours, the corks are verified and then sorted out.\r\nIn addition to the apparatus here illustrated, there is one of larger\r\ndimensions for industrial applications. This differs from the other\r\nonly in the arrangement of its details, and will hold as many as\r\n10,000 corks.--_Revue Industrielle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED BISCUIT MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration represents a combined biscuit cutting,\r\nscrapping, and panning machine, specially designed for running at high\r\nspeeds, and so arranged as to allow of the relative movements of the\r\nvarious parts being adjusted while in motion. The cutters or dies,\r\nmounted on a cross head working in a vertical guide frame, are\r\noperated from the main shaft by eccentrics and vertical connecting\r\nrods, as shown. These rods are connected to the lower strap of the\r\neccentric by long guide bolts, on which intermediate spiral springs\r\nare mounted, and by this means, although the dies are brought quickly\r\ndown to the dough, they are suffered to remain in contact therewith,\r\nunder a gradually increasing pressure, for a sufficient length of time\r\nto insure the dough being effectually stamped and completely cut\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED BISCUIT MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nFurther, the springs tend to counteract any tendency to vibration that\r\nmight be set up by the rapid reciprocation of the cross head, cutters,\r\nand their attendant parts. Mounted also on the main shaft is one of a\r\npair of reversed cone drums. These, with their accompanying belt and\r\nits adjusting gear, worked by a hand wheel and traversing screw, as\r\nshown, serve to adjust the speed of the feed rollers, so as to suit\r\nthe different lengths of the intermediate travel or \"skip\" of the\r\ndough-carrying web.\r\n\r\nProvision is made for taking up the slack of this belt by mounting the\r\nspindle of the outer coned drum in bearings adjustable along a\r\ncircular path struck from the axis of the lower feed roller as a\r\ncenter, thus insuring a uniform engagement between the teeth of the\r\nsmall pinion and those of the spur wheel with which the drum and\r\nroller are respectively provided.\r\n\r\nThe webs for carrying forward the dough between the different\r\noperations pass round rollers, which are each operated by an\r\nadjustable silent clutch feed, in place of the usual ratchet and pawl\r\nmechanism. Movement is given to each feed by the connecting links\r\nshown, to each of which motion is in turn imparted by the bell crank\r\nlever placed beside the eccentric. This lever is actuated by a crank\r\npin on the main shaft, working into a block sliding in a slot in the\r\nshorter or horizontal arm of the lever, while a similar but adjustable\r\nblock, sliding in the vertical arm, serves to impart the motion of the\r\nlever to the system of connecting links, the adjustable block allowing\r\nof a longer or shorter stroke being given to the different feeds, as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe scraps are carried over the roller in rear of the cutters, and so\r\nto a scrap pan, while the stamped biscuits pass by a lower web into\r\nthe pans. These pans are carried by two endless chains, provided with\r\npins, which take hold of the pans and carry them along in the proper\r\nposition. The roller over which these chains pass is operated by a\r\nsilent clutch, and in order to give an additional motion to the chains\r\nwhen a pan is full, and it is desired to bring the next pan into\r\nposition, an additional clutch is caused to operate upon the roller.\r\nThis clutch is kept out of gear with its pulley by means of a\r\nprojection upon it bearing against a disk slightly greater in diameter\r\nthan the pulley, and provided with two notches, into which the\r\nprojection passes when the additional feed is required.\r\n\r\nThe makers, H. Edwards & Co., Liverpool, have run one of these\r\nmachines easily and smoothly at a hundred revolutions per minute, at\r\nwhich speed, and when absorbing about 3.5 horse power, the output\r\nwould equal 4,000 small biscuits per minute.--_Industries._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED CREAM SEPARATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hand separator of this type was exhibited at the Royal Show at\r\nNewcastle by the Aylesbury Dairy Company, of 31 St. Petersburg Place,\r\nBayswater, England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED CREAM SEPARATOR. Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED CREAM SEPARATOR. Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is a perspective view of the machine, Fig. 2 being a vertical\r\nsection. The drums of these machines, which make 2,700 revolutions per\r\nminute for the large and 4,000 for the small one, have a diameter of\r\n27 in. and 15½ in. respectively, and are capable of extracting the\r\ncream from 220 and 115 gallons of milk per hour. These drums are\r\nformed by hydraulic pressure from one piece of sheet steel. To avoid\r\nthe possibility of the machines being overdriven, which might happen\r\nthrough the negligence of the attendant or through the governing gear\r\non the engine failing to act, an ingenious controlling apparatus is\r\nfixed to the intermediate motion of the separator as shown in Fig. 3.\r\nThis apparatus consists of a pair of governor balls pivoted near the\r\ncenter of the arms and attached to the main shaft of the intermediate\r\ngear by means of a collar fixed on it. The main shaft is bored out\r\nsufficiently deep to admit a steel rod, against which bear the three\r\nends of the governor arms. The steel rod presses against the\r\ncounterbalance, which is made exactly the right weight to withstand\r\nthe force tending to raise it, when the intermediate motion is running\r\nat its designed speed. The forks between which the belt runs are also\r\nprovided with a balance weight. This brings them to the loose pulley,\r\nunless they are fixed by means of the ratchet. Should the number of\r\nrevolutions of the intermediate increase beyond the correct amount,\r\nthe extra centrifugal force imparted to the governor balls enables\r\nthem to overcome the balance weight, and in raising this they raise\r\nthe arm. This arm striking against the ratchet detent releases the\r\nbalance weight, and the belt is at once brought on to the loose\r\npulley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED CREAM SEPARATOR. Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe steel drum is fitted with an internal ring at the bottom (see Fig.\r\n2), into which the milk flows, and from which it is delivered, by\r\nthree apertures, to the periphery of the drum, thus preventing the\r\nmilk from striking against the cone of the drum, and from mixing with\r\nthe cream which has already been separated. The upper part of the drum\r\nis fitted with an annular flange, about 1½ in. from the top, reaching\r\nto within one-sixteenth of an inch of the periphery. After the\r\nseparation of the skim milk from the cream, the former passes behind\r\nand above this flange through the aperture, B, and is removed by means\r\nof the tube, D, furnished with a steel tip projecting from the cover\r\nof the machine into the space between the top of the drum and the\r\nannular flange, a similar tube, F, reaching below this flange,\r\nremoving the cream which collects there. The skim milk tube is\r\nprovided with a screw regulator, the function of which is to enable\r\ncream of any desired consistency to be obtained, varying with the\r\ndistance between the skim milk and cream points from the center of the\r\ndrum. Another point about these tubes is their use as elevating tubes\r\nfor the skim, milk and cream, as, owing to the velocity at which the\r\ndrum is rotating, the products can be delivered by these tubes at a\r\nheight of 8 or 10 feet above the machine if required, thus enabling\r\nscalding and cooling of either to be carried on while the separator is\r\nat work, and saving hand labor.--_Iron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS FROM OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the twenty-fourth annual meeting of the Gas Institute, which was\r\nrecently held in Glasgow, Dr. Stevenson Macadam, F.R.S.E., lecturer on\r\nchemistry, Edinburgh, submitted the first paper, which was on \"Gas\r\nfrom Oil.\"\r\n\r\nHe said that during the last seventeen years he had devoted much\r\nattention to the photogenic or illuminating values of different\r\nqualities of paraffin oils in various lamps, and to the production of\r\npermanent illuminating gas from such oils. The earlier experiments\r\nwere directed to the employment of paraffin oils as oils, and the\r\nresults proved the great superiority of the paraffin oils as\r\nilluminating agents over vegetable and animal oils, alike for\r\nlighthouse and ordinary house service.\r\n\r\nThe later trials were mainly concerned with the breaking up of the\r\nparaffin oils into permanent illuminating gas. Experiments were made\r\nat low heats, medium heats, and high heats, which proved that,\r\naccording to the respective qualities of the paraffin oils employed in\r\nthe trials, there was more or less tendency at the lower heats to\r\ndistill oil instead of permanent gas, while at the high heats there\r\nwas a liability to decarbonize the oil and gas, and to obtain a thin\r\ngas of comparatively small illuminating power. When, however, a good\r\ncherry red heat was maintained, the oils split up in large proportion\r\ninto permanent gas of high illuminating quality, accompanied by little\r\ntarry matter, and with only a slight amount of separated carbon or\r\ndeposited soot.\r\n\r\nThe best mode of splitting up the paraffin oils, and the special\r\narrangements of the retort or distilling apparatus, also formed, he\r\nsaid, an extensive inquiry by itself. In one set of trials the oil was\r\ndistilled into gaseous vapor, and then passed through the retort. In\r\nanother set of experiments, the oil was run into or allowed to trickle\r\ninto the retorts, while both modes of introducing the oil were tried\r\nin retorts charged with red hot coke and in retorts free from coke.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it was found that the best results were obtained by the\r\nmore simple arrangement of employing iron retorts at a good cherry red\r\nheat, and running in the oil as a thin stream direct into the retort,\r\nso that it quickly impinged upon the red hot metal, and without the\r\nintervention of any coke or other matter in the retorts. The paraffin\r\noils employed in the investigations were principally: (1) Crude\r\nparaffin oil, being the oil obtained direct from the destructive\r\ndistillation of shale in retorts; (2) green paraffin oil, which is\r\nyielded by distilling or re-running the crude paraffin oil, and\r\nremoving the lighter or more inflammable portion by fractional\r\ndistillation; and (3) blue paraffin oil, which is obtained by\r\nrectifying the twice run oil with sulphuric acid and soda, and\r\ndistilling off the paraffin spirit, burning oil, and intermediate oil,\r\nand freezing out the solid paraffin as paraffin scale. The best\r\npractical trials were obtained in Pintsch's apparatus and in Keith's\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nAfter describing both of these, Dr. Macadam went on to give in great\r\ndetail the results obtained in splitting up blue paraffin oil into gas\r\nin each apparatus. He then said that these experimental results\r\ndemonstrated that Pintsch's apparatus yielded from the gallon of oil\r\nin one case 90.70 cubic feet of gas of 62.50 candle power, and in the\r\nsecond case 103.36 cubic feet of 59.15 candle gas, or an average of\r\n97.03 cubic feet of 60.82 candle power gas.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the firing of the retorts was moderate, though in the\r\nsecond trial greater care was taken to secure uniformity of heat, and\r\nthe oil was run in more slowly, so that there was more thorough\r\nsplitting up of the oil into permanent gas. The gas obtained in the\r\ntwo trials was of high quality, owing to its containing a large\r\npercentage of heavy hydrocarbons, of which there were, respectively,\r\n39.25 and 37.15 per cent., or an average of 38.2 per cent., while the\r\nsulphureted hydrogen was nothing, and the carbonic acid a mere trace.\r\nBesides testing the gas on the occasion of the actual trials, he had\r\nalso examined samples of the gas which he had taken from various\r\ncylinders in which the gas had been stored for several months under a\r\npressure of ten atmospheres, and in all cases the gas was found to be\r\npractically equal to the quantity mentioned, and hence of a permanent\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nBy using Keith's apparatus the results obtained were generally the\r\nsame, with the exception that an average of 0.27 per cent. of carbonic\r\nacid gas and decided proportions of sulphureted hydrogen were found to\r\nbe present in the gas. Dr. Macadam devoted some remarks to the\r\nconsideration of the question as to how far the gas obtained from the\r\nparaffin oil represented the light power of the oil itself, and then\r\nhe proceeded to say that, taking the crude paraffin oil at 2d. a\r\ngallon, and with a specific gravity of 850 (water = 1,000), or 8½ lb.\r\nto the gallon, there were 264 gallons to the ton, at a cost of £2 4s.\r\nper ton. The sperm light from the ton of oil as gas being 3,443 lb.,\r\nhe reckoned that fully 6 lb. of sperm light were obtained from a\r\npennyworth of the crude oil as gas.\r\n\r\nThen, taking the blue paraffin oil at 4d. per gallon, and there being\r\n255 gallons to the ton, it was found that the cost of one ton was £4\r\n5s., and as the sperm light of a ton of that oil as gas was 5,150 lb.,\r\nit was calculated that 5 lb. of sperm light were yielded in the gas\r\nfrom a pennyworth of the blue oil. The very rich character of the oil\r\ngas rendered it unsuitable for consumption at ordinary gas jets,\r\nthough it burned readily and satisfactorily at small burners not\r\nlarger than No. 1 jets.\r\n\r\nIn practical use it would be advisable to reduce the quality by\r\nadmixture with thin and feeble gas, or to employ the oil gas simply\r\nfor enriching inferior gases derived from the more common coals. On\r\nthe question of dilution, he said that he preferred to use carbonic\r\noxide and hydrogen, and most of the remainder of his paper was devoted\r\nto an explanation of the best mode of preparing those gases (water\r\ngases).\r\n\r\nHe concluded by saying: The employment of paraffin oil for gas making\r\nhas advantages in its favor, in the readiness of charging the retorts,\r\nas the oil can be run in continuously for days at a time, and may be\r\ndiscontinued and commenced again without opening, clearing out\r\nresidual products, recharging and reclosing the retorts. There is\r\nnecessarily, therefore, less labor and cost in working, and as the gas\r\nis cleaner or freer from impurities, purifying plant and material will\r\nbe correspondingly less. Oil gas is now employed for lighthouse\r\nservice in the illumination of the lanterns on Ailsa Craig and as\r\nmotive power in the gas engines connected with the fog horns at\r\nLangness and Ailsa Craig lighthouse stations. It is also used largely\r\nin the lighting of railway carriages. Various populous places are now\r\nintroducing oil gas for house service, and he felt sure that the\r\nsystem is one which ought to commend itself for its future development\r\nto the careful consideration and practical skill of the members of the\r\nGas Institute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF SALT NEAR MIDDLESBROUGH.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Abstract of paper read before the Institution of\r\n               Civil Engineers, May 17, 1887.]\r\n\r\nBy Sir LOWTHIAN BELL, Bart., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geology of the Middlesbrough salt region was first referred to,\r\nand it was stated that the development of the salt industry in that\r\ndistrict was the result of accident. In 1859, Messrs. Bolckow &\r\nVaughan sank a deep well at Middlesbrough, in the hope of obtaining\r\nwater for steam and other purposes in connection with their iron works\r\nin that town, although they had previously been informed of the\r\nprobably unsuitable character of the water if found. The bore hole was\r\nput down to a depth of 1,200 feet, when a bed of salt rock was struck,\r\nwhich proved to have a thickness of about 100 feet. At that time\r\none-eighth of the total salt production of Cheshire was being brought\r\nto the Tyne for the chemical works on that river, hence the discovery\r\nof salt instead of water was regarded by some as the reverse of a\r\ndisappointment. The mode of reaching the salt rock by an ordinary\r\nshaft, however, failed, from the influx of water being too great, and\r\nnothing more was heard of Middlesbrough salt until a dozen years\r\nlater, when Messrs. Bell Brothers, of Port Clarence, decided to try\r\nthe practicability of raising the salt by a method detailed in the\r\npaper. A site was selected 1,314 yards distant from the well of\r\nMessrs. Bolckow & Vaughan, and the Diamond Rock Boring Company was\r\nintrusted with the work of putting down a hole in order to ascertain\r\nwhether the bed of salt extended under their land. This occupied\r\nnearly two years, when the salt, 65 feet in thickness, was reached at\r\na depth of 1,127 feet. Other reasons induced the owners of the\r\nClarence iron works to continue the bore hole for 150 feet below the\r\nbed of salt; a depth of 1,342 feet from the surface was then reached.\r\nDuring the process of boring, considerable quantities of inflammable\r\ngas were met with, which, on the application of flame, took fire at\r\nthe surface of the water in the bore hole. The origin of this gas, in\r\nconnection with the coal measures underlying the magnesian limestone,\r\nwill probably hereafter be investigated.\r\n\r\nFor raising the salt, recourse was had to the method of solution, the\r\nprinciple being that a column of descending water should raise the\r\nbrine nearly as far as the differences of specific gravity between the\r\ntwo liquids permitted--in the present case about 997 feet. In other\r\nwords, a column of fresh water of 1,200 feet brought the brine to\r\nwithin 203 feet of the surface. For the practical application of this\r\nsystem a hole of say 12 inches in diameter at the surface was\r\ncommenced, and a succession of wrought iron tubes put down as the\r\nboring proceeded, the pipes being of gradually decreasing diameter,\r\nuntil the bottom of the salt bed was reached. The portion of this\r\nouter or retaining tube, where it passed through the bed of salt, was\r\npierced with two sets of apertures, the upper edge of the higher set\r\ncoinciding with the top of the seam, and the other set occupying the\r\nlower portion of the tube. Within the tube so arranged, and secured at\r\nits lower extremity by means of a cavity sunk in the limestone, a\r\nsecond tube was lowered, having an outer diameter from two to four\r\ninches less than the interior diameter of the first tube. The latter\r\nserved for pumping the brine. The pump used was of the ordinary bucket\r\nand clack type, but, in addition, at the surface, there was a plunger,\r\nwhich served to force the brine into an air vessel for the purposes of\r\ndistribution. The bucket and clack were placed some feet below the\r\npoint to which the brine was raised by the column of fresh water\r\ndescending in the annulus formed between the two tubes. In commencing\r\nwork, water was let down the annulus until the cavity formed in the\r\nsalt became sufficiently large to admit of a few hours' pumping of\r\nconcentrated brine. On the machinery being set in motion, the stronger\r\nbrine was first drawn, which, from its greater specific gravity,\r\noccupied the lower portion of the cavity. As the brine was raised,\r\nfresh water flowed down. The solvent power of the newly admitted water\r\nwas of course greater than that of water partially saturated, and\r\nbeing also lighter it occupied the upper portion of the excavated\r\nspace. The combined effect was to give the cavity the form of an\r\ninverted cone. The mode of extraction thus possessed the disadvantage\r\nof removing the greatest quantity of the mineral where it was most\r\nwanted for supporting the roof, and had given rise to occasional\r\naccidents to the pipes underground. These were referred to in detail,\r\nand the question was started as to possible legal complications\r\narising hereafter from new bore holes put down in close proximity to\r\nthe dividing line of different properties, the pumping of brine formed\r\nunder the conditions described presenting an altogether different\r\naspect from the pumping of water or natural brine.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the paper referred to the uses to which the brine\r\nwas applied, the chief one being the manufacture of common salt. For\r\nthis purpose the brine, as delivered from the wells, was run into a\r\nlarge reservoir, where any earthy matter held in suspension was\r\nallowed to settle. The clear solution was then run into pans sixty\r\nfeet long by twenty feet wide by two feet deep. Heat was applied at\r\none end by the combustion of small coal, beyond which longitudinal\r\nwalls, serving to support the pan and to distribute the heat,\r\nconducted the products of combustion to the further extremity, where\r\nthey escaped into the chimney at a temperature of from 500° to 700°\r\nFahr. On the surface of the heated brine, kept at 196° Fahr., minute\r\ncubical crystals speedily formed. On the upper surface of these, other\r\nsmall cubes of salt arranged themselves in such a way that, in course\r\nof time, a hollow inverted pyramid of crystallized salt was formed.\r\nThis ultimately sank to the bottom, where other small crystals united\r\nwith it, so that the shape became frequently completely cubical. Every\r\nsecond day the salt was \"fished\" out and laid on drainers to permit\r\nthe adhering brine to run back into the pans. For the production of\r\ntable salt the boiling was carried on much more rapidly, and at a\r\nhigher temperature than for salt intended for soda manufacture. The\r\ncrystals were very minute, and adhered together by the solidification\r\nof the brine, effected by exposure on heated flues. For fishery\r\npurposes the crystals were preferred very coarse in size. These were\r\nobtained by evaporating the brine more slowly and at a still lower\r\ntemperature than when salt for soda makers was required. At the\r\nClarence works experiments had been made in utilizing surplus gas from\r\nthe adjacent blast furnaces, instead of fuel, under the evaporating\r\npans, the furnaces supplying more gas than was needed for heating air\r\nand raising steam for iron making. By means of this waste heat, from\r\n200 to 300 tons of salt per week were now obtained.\r\n\r\nThe paper concluded with some particulars of the soda industry. The\r\nwell-known sulphuric acid process of Leblanc had stood its ground for\r\nthree-quarters of a century in spite of several disadvantages, and\r\nvarious modes of utilizing the by-products having been from time to\r\ntime introduced, it had until recent years seemed too firmly\r\nestablished to fear any rivals. About seven years ago, however, Mr.\r\nSolvay, of Brussels, revived in a practical form the ammonia process,\r\npatented forty years ago by Messrs. Hemming & Dyar, but using brine\r\ninstead of salt, and thus avoiding the cost of evaporation. This\r\nprocess consisted of forcing into the brine currents of carbonic acid\r\nand ammoniacal gases in such proportions as to generate bicarbonate of\r\nammonia, which, reacting on the salt of the brine, gave bicarbonate of\r\nsoda and chloride of ammonium. The bicarbonate was placed in a\r\nreverberatory furnace, where the heat drove off the water and one\r\nequivalent of carbonic acid, leaving the alkali as monocarbonate. Near\r\nMiddlesbrough, the only branch of industry established in connection\r\nwith its salt trade was the manufacture of soda by an ammonia process,\r\ninvented by Mr. Schloesing, of Paris. The works were carried on in\r\nconnection with the Clarence salt works. It was believed that the\r\ntotal quantity of dry soda produced by the two ammonia processes,\r\nSolvay's and Schloesing's, in this country was something under 100,000\r\ntons per annum, but this make was considerably exceeded on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON INDUSTRIES OF JAPAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cotton plant principally cultivated in Japan is of the species\r\nknown as _Gossypium herbaceum_, resembling that of India, China, and\r\nEgypt. The plant is of short stature, seldom attaining a growth of\r\nover two feet; the flower is deciduous, with yellow petals and purple\r\ncenter, and the staple is short, but fine. It is very widely\r\ncultivated in Japan, and is produced in thirty-seven out of the\r\nforty-four prefectures forming the empire, but the best qualities and\r\nlargest quantities are grown in the southern maritime provinces of the\r\nmainland and on the islands of Kiusiu and Shikoku. Vice consul\r\nLongford, in his last report, says that the plant is not indigenous to\r\nJapan, the seed having been first imported from China in the year\r\n1558. There are now many varieties of the original species, and the\r\ncultivation of the plant varies in its details in different\r\nlocalities. The variations are, however, mostly in dates, and the\r\ngeneral grinding principles of the several operations are nearly the\r\nsame throughout the whole country. The land best suited for cotton\r\ngrowing is one of a sandy soil, the admixture of earth and sand being\r\nin the proportion of two parts earth to one of sand. During the winter\r\nand spring months, crops of wheat or barley are raised on it, and it\r\nis when these crops have attained their full height during the month\r\nof May that the cotton is sown. About fifty days prior to the sowing a\r\nmanure is prepared consisting of chopped straw, straw ashes, green\r\ngrass, rice, bran, and earth from the bottom of the stagnant pools.\r\nThese ingredients are all carefully mixed together in equal\r\nproportions, and the manure thus made is allowed to stand till\r\nrequired for use. Ten days before the time fixed for sowing, narrow\r\ntrenches, about one inch in depth, are dug in the furrows, between the\r\nrows of standing wheat or barleys and the manure is liberally\r\nsprinkled along them by hand. For one night before sowing the seed is\r\nsteeped in water. It is then taken out, slightly mixed with straw\r\nashes, and sown in the trenches at intervals of a few inches. When\r\nsown, it is covered with earth to the depth of half an inch, and\r\ngently trampled down by foot. Four or five days after sowing, the buds\r\nbegin to appear above the earth, and almost simultaneously the wheat\r\nor barley between which they grow is ripe for the sickle. While the\r\nlatter is being harvested, the cotton may be left to itself, but not\r\nfor very long. The buds appear in much larger numbers than the soil\r\ncould support if they were allowed to grow. They have accordingly to\r\nbe carefully thinned out, so that not more than five or six plants are\r\nleft in each foot of length. The next process is the sprinkling of a\r\nmanure composed of one part night soil and three parts water, and\r\nagain, subsequent to this, there are two further manurings; one of a\r\nmixture of dried sardines, lees of oil, and lees of rice beer, which\r\nis applied about the middle of June, when the plant has attained a\r\nheight of four inches; and again early in July, when the plant has\r\ngrown to a height of six or seven inches, a further manuring of night\r\nsoil, mixed with a larger proportion of water than before. At this\r\nstage the head of the plant is pinched off with the fingers, in order\r\nto check the excessive growth of the stem, and direct the strength\r\ninto the branches, which usually number five or six. From these\r\nbranches minor ones spring, but the latter are carefully pruned off as\r\nthey appear. In the middle of August the flowers begin to appear\r\ngradually. They fall soon after their appearance, leaving in their\r\nplace the pod or peach (_momo_), which, after ripening, opens in\r\nOctober by three or four valves and exposes the cotton to view. The\r\ncotton is gathered in baskets, in which it is allowed to remain till a\r\nbright, sunshiny day, when it is spread out on mats to dry and swell\r\nin the sun for two or three days. After drying, the cotton is packed\r\nin bags made of straw matting, and either sold or put aside until such\r\ntime as the farmer's leisure from other agricultural operations\r\nenables him to deal with it. The average yield of cotton in good\r\ndistricts in Japan is about 120 lb. to the acre, but as cotton is only\r\na secondary crop, this does not therefore represent the whole profit\r\ngained by the farmer from his land. The prefectures in which the\r\nproduction is largest are Aichi on the east coast, Osaka, Hiogo,\r\nHiroshima, and Yamaguchi on the inland sea, and Fukui and Ishikawa on\r\nthe west coast. Vice-consul Longford says that the manufacture of\r\ncotton in Japan is still in all its stages largely a domestic one.\r\nGin, spindle, and loom are all found in the house of the farmer on\r\nwhose land the cotton is grown, and not only what is required for the\r\nwants of his own family is spun and woven by the female members\r\nthereof, but a surplus is also produced for sale.\r\n\r\nSeveral spinning factories with important English machinery have been\r\nestablished during the last twenty years, but Consul Longford says\r\nthat he has only known of one similar cotton-weaving factory, and that\r\nhas not been a successful experiment. Other so called weaving\r\nfactories throughout the country consist only of a collection of the\r\nordinary hand looms, to the number of forty or fifty, scarcely ever\r\nreaching to one hundred, in one building or shed, wherein individual\r\nmanufacturers have their own special piece goods made.\r\n\r\nThe first operation in the manufacture is that of ginning, which is\r\nconducted by means of a small implement called the _rokuro_, or\r\nwindlass. This consists of two wooden rollers revolving in opposite\r\ndirections, fixed on a frame about 12 inches high and 6 inches in\r\nwidth, standing on a small platform, the dimensions of which slightly\r\nexceed that of the frame. The operator, usually a woman, kneels on one\r\nside of the frame, holding it firm by her weight, works the roller\r\nwith one hand, and with the other presses the cotton, which she takes\r\nfrom a heap at her side, between the rollers. The cotton passes\r\nthrough, falling in small lumps on the other side of the frame, while\r\nthe seeds fall on that nearest the woman. The utmost weight of\r\nunginned cotton that one woman working an entire day of ten hours can\r\ngive is from 8 lb. to 10 lb., which gives, in the end, only a little\r\nover 3 lb. weight of ginned cotton, and her daily earnings amount to\r\nless than 2d. A few saw gins have been introduced into Japan during\r\nthe last fifteen years, but no effort has been made to secure their\r\ndistribution throughout the country districts. After ginning, a\r\ncertain proportion of the seed is reserved for the agricultural\r\nrequirements of the following year, and the remainder is sent to oil\r\nfactories, where it is pressed, and yields about one-eighth of its\r\ncapacity in measurement in oil, the refuse, after pressing, being used\r\nfor manure. The ginning having been finished in the country districts,\r\nthe cotton is either packed in bales and sent to the dealers in the\r\ncities, or else the next process, that of carding, is at once\r\nproceeded with on the spot.\r\n\r\nThis process is almost as primitive as that of the ginning. A long\r\nbamboo, sufficiently thin to be flexible, is fastened at its base to a\r\npillar or the corner of a small room. It slopes upward into the center\r\nof the room, and from its upper end a hempen cord is suspended. To\r\nthis is fastened the \"bow,\" an instrument made of oak, about five feet\r\nin length, two inches in circumference, and shaped like a ladle. A\r\nstring of coarse catgut is tightly stretched from end to end of the\r\nbow, and this is beaten with a small mallet made of willow, bound at\r\nthe end with a ring of iron or brass. The raw cotton, in its coarse\r\nstate, is piled on the floor just underneath the string of the bow.\r\nThe string is then rapidly beaten with the mallet, and as it rises and\r\nfalls it catches the rough cotton, cuts it to the required degree of\r\nfineness, removes impurities from it, and flings it to the side of the\r\noperator, where it falls on a hempen net stretched over a four-cornered\r\nwooden frame. The spaces of the net are about one-quarter of an inch\r\nsquare, and through these any particles of dust that may still have\r\nadhered to the cotton fall to the floor, leaving piled on top of the\r\nnet the pure cotton wool in its finished state. This work is always\r\nperformed by a man, and by assiduous toil throughout a long day, one\r\nman can card from ten to twenty pounds weight of raw cotton. Payment is\r\nmade in proportion to the work done, and in the less remote country\r\ndistricts is at the rate of about one penny for each pound carded. As\r\nregards spinning and weaving, in the first of these branches of cotton\r\nmanufacture the Japanese have largely had recourse to the aid of\r\nforeign machinery, but it is still to a much greater extent a domestic\r\nindustry, or at best carried on like weaving in the establishments of\r\ncotton traders, in which a number of workers, varying from 20 to 100 or\r\nmore, each with his own spinning wheel, are collected together. Consul\r\nLongford says the spinning wheel used in Japan differs in no respect\r\nfrom that used in the country 300 years ago or (except that bamboo\r\nforms an integral part of the materials of which it is made) from that\r\nused in England prior to the invention of the jenny. The cost of one of\r\nthe wheels is about 9d., it will last for five or six years, and with\r\nit a woman of ordinary skill can spin about 1 lb. of yarn in a day of\r\nten hours, earning thereby about 2d. There are at present in various\r\nparts of Japan, in all, 21 spinning factories worked by foreign\r\nmachinery. Of four of these there is no information, but of the\r\nremainder, one has 120 spindles; eleven, 2,000 spindles; two, 3,000\r\nspindles; two, 4,000 spindles; and one, 18,000 spindles.--_Journal Soc.\r\nof Arts._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 612, page 9774.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRIFUGAL EXTRACTORS.\r\n\r\nBy ROBERT F. GIBSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR MACHINES.--Besides separating the crystalline sugar and the\r\nsirup, secondary objects are to wash the crystals and to pack them in\r\ncakes. The cleansing fluid or \"white liquor\" is introduced at the\r\ncenter of the basket and is hurled against and passes through the sugar\r\nwall left from draining. The basket may be divided into compartments\r\nand the liquor guided into each. The compartments are removable boxes\r\nand are shaped to give bars or cakes or any form desired of sugar in\r\nmass. These boxes being removable cannot fit tightly against the liquor\r\nguides, and the liquor is apt to escape. This difficulty is overcome by\r\ngiving the guides radial movement or by having rubber packing around\r\nthe edges.\r\n\r\nSugar machines proper are of two kinds--those which are loaded, drained\r\nand then unloaded and those which are continuous in their working. The\r\nvarious figures preceding are of the first kind, and what has been said\r\nof vibrations applies directly to these.\r\n\r\nThe general advantages claimed for continuous working over intermittent\r\nare--that saving is made of time and motive power incident to\r\nintroducing charge and developing velocity, in retarding and stopping,\r\nand in discharging; that, as the power is brought into the machine\r\ncontinuously, no shifting of belts or ungearing is necessary; and that\r\nthere are less of the dangers incident to variable motion, either in\r\nthe machine itself or the belting or gearing. The magma (the mixture of\r\ncrystalline sugar and sirup) is fed in gradually, by which means it is\r\nmore likely to assume a position of equilibrium in the basket.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of discharging in continuous working--the sugar\r\nis thrown out periodically as the basket fills, or continuously. In\r\nneither case is the speed slackened. In the first either the upper\r\nhalf of the basket has an upward motion, on the lower half a downward\r\nmotion (Pat. 252,483); and through the opening thus made the sugar is\r\nthrown. Fig. 22 (R.B. Palmer & Sons) is a machine of this kind. The\r\nbottom, B, with the cone distributor, _a_, have downward motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\nContinuous discharge of the second kind may be brought about by having\r\na scoop fixed to the curb (or casing), extending down into the basket\r\nand delivering the sugar over the side (Pat. 144,319). Another method\r\nwill be described under \"Beet Machines.\"\r\n\r\nBASKET.--The construction of the basket is exceedingly important. Hard\r\nexperience has taught this. When centrifugals were first introduced,\r\nusers were compelled by law to put them below ground; for they\r\nfrequently exploded, owing to the speed being suddenly augmented by\r\ninequalities in the running of the engine or to the basket being too\r\nweak to resist the centrifugal force of the overcharge. Increasing the\r\nthickness merely adds to the centrifugal force, and hence to the\r\ndanger, as even a perfectly balanced basket may sever.\r\n\r\nOne plan for a better basket was to have more than one wall. For\r\nexample, there might be an inner wall of perforated copper, then one\r\nof wire gauze, and then another of copper with larger perforations.\r\nAnother plan was to have an internal metallic cloth, bearing against\r\nthe internally projecting ridges of the corrugations of the basket\r\nwall. A further complication is to give this internal gauze cylinder a\r\nrotation relative to the basket.\r\n\r\nThe basket wall has been variously constructed. In one case it\r\nconsists of wire wound round and round and fastened to uprights,\r\ncommonly known as the \"wire basket;\" in another case of a periphery\r\nwithout perforations, but spirally corrugated and having an opening at\r\nthe bottom for the escape of the extracted liquid; in still another of\r\na series of narrow bars or rings, placed edgewise, packed as close as\r\ndesired. An advantage of this last style is that it is easily cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe best basket consists of sheet metal with bored perforations and\r\nhaving bands or flanges sprung on around the outside. The metal is\r\nbrass, if it is apt to be corroded; if not, sheet iron. The\r\nperforations may be round, or horizontally much longer than wide\r\nvertically. One method for the manufacture of the basket wall (Pat.\r\n149,553) is to roll down a plate, having round perforations, to the\r\nrequired thickness, causing narrowing and elongation of the holes and\r\nat the same time hardening the plate by compacting its texture. Long\r\nnarrow slots are well adapted to catch sugar crystals, and this is not\r\nan unimportant point. Round perforations are usually countersunk.\r\nInstead of flanges, wire bands have been used, their lapping ends\r\nsecured by solder.\r\n\r\nAs to comparative wear, it maybe remarked that one perforated basket\r\nwill outlast three wire ones.\r\n\r\nAs to size, sugar baskets vary from 80 inches in diameter by 14 in.\r\ndepth to 54 by 24. They are made, however, in England as large as 6\r\nfeet in diameter--a size which can be run only at a comparatively slow\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nA peculiar complication of basket deserves notice (Pat. 275 874). It\r\nhad been noticed that when a charge of magma was put into a\r\ncentrifugal in one mass, the sugar wall on the side of the basket was\r\napt to form irregularly, too thick at base and of varied color. To\r\nremedy this it was suggested to have within and concentric with the\r\nbasket a charger with flaring sides, into which the mixture was to be\r\nput. When this charger reached a certain rotary velocity, the magma\r\nwould be hurled out over the edge by centrifugal force and evenly\r\ndistributed on the wall of the main basket.\r\n\r\nSPINDLE.--The spindle as now made is solid cast steel, and the\r\nconsiderations governing its size, form, material, etc., are identical\r\nwith those for any spindle. In order that the basket might be replaced\r\nby another after draining, the shaft has been made telescopic, but at\r\nthe expense of stability and rigidity. In Fig. 16 is shown a device to\r\navoid crystallizations, which are apt to occur in large forgings, and\r\nwould prove fatal should they creep into the upper part of the spindle\r\nproper in a hanging machine. It consists of the secondary spindle, _c_.\r\n\r\nDISCHARGING.--The drained sugar may either be lifted over the top of\r\nthe basket (in machines which stop to be emptied), or be cast through\r\nopenings in the bottom provided with valves. A section of the best form\r\nof valve may be seen in Figs. 15 and 17. Fig. 23 is a plan of the\r\nopenings. The valve turns on the basket bearing. It may be constructed\r\nto open in the same direction in which the basket turns; so that when\r\nthe brake is put on, the inertia of the valve operates to open it and\r\nwhile running to keep it closed. There are many other styles, but no\r\nother need be mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\nCASING.--The different styles of casing may be seen by reference to the\r\nvarious drawings. In one machine (not described) the casing is rigidly\r\nfixed to the basket, space enough being left between the bottom of the\r\nbasket and the bottom of the casing to hold all the molasses from a\r\ncharge. This arrangement merely adds to the bulk of the revolving\r\nparts, and no real advantage is gained.\r\n\r\nBEARINGS.--The various styles of bearings can be seen by reference to\r\nthe figures. One which deserves special attention is shown in Fig. 16\r\nand Fig. 19. In one case it consists of loose disks, in the other of\r\nloose washers, rotating on one another. They are alternately of steel\r\nand hard bronze (copper and tin).\r\n\r\n\"There is probably no machine so little understood or so imperfectly\r\nconstructed by the common manufacturer of sugar supplies as the high\r\nspeed separator or centrifugal.\" Unless the product of experience and\r\ngood workmanship, it is a dangerous thing at high velocities. Besides,\r\nits usual fate is to have an incompetent workman assigned to it, who\r\ndoes not use judgment in charging and running. So that designers and\r\nmanufacturers have been forced not only to take into account the\r\ndisturbing forces inherent in revolving bodies, but also to make\r\nallowance for poor management in running and neglect in cleaning.\r\n\r\nCANE AND BEET MACHINES.--The first step in the process of sugar making\r\nis the extraction of the juice from the beet or cane. This juice is\r\nobtained by pressure. The operation is not usually, but may be,\r\nperformed in a special kind of centrifugal. One style (Pat. 239,222)\r\nconsists of a conical basket with a spiral flange within on the shaft,\r\nand turning on the shaft, and having a slight rotary motion relative to\r\nthe basket. The material is fed in and moves downward under increased\r\npressure, the sirup released flying out through the perforations of the\r\nbasket, the whole revolving at high velocity. The solid portion falls\r\nout at the bottom. Another plan suggested (Pat. 343,932) is to let a\r\nloose cover of an ordinary cylindrical basket screw itself down into\r\nthe basket, by reason of its slower velocity (owing to inertia),\r\ncausing pressure on the charge.\r\n\r\nVarious other applications of the different styles of sugar machines\r\nare the defibration of raw sugar juice, freeing beet crystals of\r\nobjectionable salts, freeing various crystals of the mother liquor,\r\ndrying saltpeter.\r\n\r\nDRIERS.--Another important division of this first class of centrifugals\r\nis that of driers or, as they are variously styled, whizzers, wringers,\r\nhydro-extractors. The charge in these is never large in weight compared\r\nto a sugar charge, and its initial distribution can be made more\r\nsymmetrical. The uses of driers are various, such as extracting water\r\nfrom clothes, cloth, silk, yarns, etc. Water may be introduced at the\r\ncenter of the basket from above or below to wash the material before\r\ndraining. A typical form of drier is shown in Fig. 24. (Pat. Aug. 22,\r\n1876--W.P. Uhlinger.) Baskets have been made removable for use in\r\ndyeing establishments, basket and load together going into dyeing vat.\r\nYarn and similar material can be drained by a method analogous to that\r\nof hanging it upon sticks in a room and allowing the water to drip off.\r\nIt is suspended from short sticks, which are held in horizontal layers\r\naround the shaft in the basket, and the action is such during the\r\noperation as to cause the yarn to stand out in radial lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\nDriers are not materially different from sugar machines. Any of the\r\ndevices before enumerated for meeting vibrations in the latter may be\r\napplied to the former. There is one curious invention which has been\r\napplied to driers only (Pat. 322,762--W.H. Tolhurst). See Fig. 25. A\r\nconvex shaft-supporting step resting on a concave supporting base,\r\nwith the center of its arc of concavity at the center of the upper\r\nuniversal joint, has been employed, and its movements controlled by\r\nsprings, but the step was apt to be forced from its support. The\r\ndrawing shows the improvement on this, which is to give the\r\nshaft-supporting step a less radius of curvature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting form of drier has its own motor, a little steam engine,\r\nattached to the frame of the machine. See Fig 24. This of course\r\ndemands fixed bearings. The engine is very small. One size used is 3\"×4\".\r\nWhen a higher velocity of basket is required, we have the arrangement\r\nin Fig. 26.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nMOTORS.--This naturally introduces the subject of motive power. We may\r\nhave the engine direct acting as above, or the power may be brought on\r\nby belting. Fig. 27 shows a drier with pulley for belting. Fig. 28\r\n(W.H. Tolhurst) shows a very common arrangement of belting and also the\r\nfast and loose pulleys. When the heaviest part of the engine is so far\r\nfrom the vertical shaft as to overhang the casing on one side, there is\r\napt to be an objectionable tremor. To remedy this, it is suggested to\r\nput these heavy parts as near the shaft as possible. It has been\r\nsuggested also to use the Westinghouse type of engine, although the\r\ntype shown in Fig. 24 works faultlessly in practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\nOne plan (Pat. 346,030), designed to combine the advantages of a direct\r\nacting motor and an oscillating shaft, mounts the whole machine, motor\r\nand all, on a rocking frame. The spindle is of course in fixed bearings\r\nin the frame. However, the plan is not practical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\nIn driers the direct acting engine has many advantages over the belt.\r\nThe atmosphere is always very moist about a whizzer, and there are\r\nfrequently injurious fumes. The belt will be alternately dry and wet,\r\nstretched and limp, and wears out rapidly and is liable to sever. In\r\nall machines in which the shaft oscillates, if the center of\r\noscillation does not lie in the central plane of the belt, the tension\r\nof the latter is not uniform. This affects badly both the belt and the\r\nrunning. A reference to the various figures will show the best position\r\nfor the pulley.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty experienced with belting is in getting up speed\r\nand stopping. The basket must not be started with a sudden impulse. Its\r\ninertia will resist and something must give way. A gradual starting can\r\nbe obtained by the slipping of the belt at first, but this is\r\nexpensive. The best plan is to conduct the power through a species of\r\nfriction clutch--an iron disk between two wooden ones. This has been\r\nfound to work admirably.\r\n\r\nBRAKES.--The first centrifugals had no brakes. They ran until the\r\nfriction of the bearings was sufficient to stop them. This occasioned,\r\nhowever, rapid wearing and too great a loss of time. The best material\r\nfor a brake consists of soft wood into which shoe pegs have been\r\ndriven, and which is thoroughly saturated with oil. The wooden disks\r\nreferred to just above are of the same construction. The center of\r\noscillation ought to be in the central plane of the brake as well as\r\nthat of the pulley, but the preference is given to the pulley.\r\n\r\nFigs. 15 and 16 (I) give sectional views of a brake for hanging\r\nmachines. Figs. 19, 20, and 21 give two sections and a view of a brake\r\nwhich can be used on both hanging and standing machines. A very simple\r\nform of brake is shown in Figs. 24, 26, and 27 (A), a mere block\r\npressing on the rim of the basket.\r\n\r\nOIL AND FAT.--A machine in most respects like a whizzer is used for the\r\n\"extraction of oil and fat and oily and fatty matters from woolen yarns\r\nand fabrics, and such other fibrous material or mixtures of materials\r\nas are from their nature affected in color or quality when hydrocarbons\r\nare used for the purpose of extracting such oily or fatty matters, and\r\nare subsequently removed from the material under treatment by the slow\r\nprocess of admitting steam, or using other means of raising the\r\ntemperature to the respective boiling points of such hydrocarbons, and\r\nso driving them off by evaporation.\" In the centrifugal method\r\ncarbon-bisulphide, or some other volatile agent, is admitted and is\r\ndriven through the material by centrifugal force, when the necessary\r\nreactions take place, and is allowed to escape in the form of\r\nhydrocarbons. A machine differing only in slight particulars from the\r\nabove is used for cleansing wool.\r\n\r\nLOOSE FIBER.--Another application is the drying of loose fiber. Two\r\ndistinctive points deserve to be noticed in the centrifugal used for\r\nthis purpose. An endless chain or belt provided with blades moves the\r\nmaterial vertically in the basket, and discharges it over the edge.\r\nDuring its upward course the material is subjected to a shower of water\r\nto wash it.\r\n\r\nOIL FROM METAL CHIPS.--Very material savings are made in many factories\r\nby collecting the metal chips and turnings, coated and mixed with oil,\r\nwhich fall from the various machines, and extracting the oil\r\ncentrifugally. The separator consists of a chip holder, having an\r\nimperforate shell flaring upward and outward from the spindle (in fixed\r\nbearings) to which it is attached. When filled, a cover is placed upon\r\nit and keyed to the spindle. Between the cover and holder there is a\r\nsmall annular opening through which oil, but not chips, can escape.\r\nFig. 29 (Pat. 225,949--C.F. Roper) is designed (like the greater part\r\nof the drawings inserted) to show relative position of parts merely,\r\nand not relative _size_. This style of machine can be used for sugar\r\nseparating (Pat. 345,994--F.P. Sherman) and many other purposes, to\r\nwhich, however, there are other styles more especially adapted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\nFILTERERS.--There are two distinct kinds of centrifugal filterers,\r\nworking on different principles. Petroleum separators (Pat. 217,063)\r\nare of the first kind. They are in form in all respects like a sugar\r\nmachine. The flakes of paraffine, stearine, etc., which are to be\r\nextracted, when chilled are very brittle and would be disintegrated\r\nupon being hurled against a plain wire gauze and would escape. Even a\r\nwoven fabric presents too harsh a surface. It is necessary to have a\r\nvery elastic basket lining of wool, cotton, or other fibrous material.\r\nThe basket itself may be either wire or perforated, but must have a\r\nperfectly smooth bottom.\r\n\r\nAs the pressure of the liquor upon the filtering medium per unit of\r\nsurface depends entirely upon its radial depth, mere tubes, connecting\r\na central inlet with an annular compartment, will serve the purpose\r\nquite as well as a whole basket. In this style of machine (Pat. 10,457)\r\nthe filtering material constitutes a wall between two annular\r\ncompartments. The outer one is connected with a vacuum apparatus.\r\n\r\nFilterers of the second kind work on the following principle: If a\r\ncylinder be rapidly revolved in a liquid in which solid particles are\r\nsuspended, the liquid will be drawn into a like rotation and the heavy\r\nparticles will be thrown to the outer part of the receptacle. If a\r\nperforated cylinder is used as stirrer, the purified liquid will escape\r\ninto it through the perforations and may be conducted away. The\r\nimpurities, likewise, after falling down the sides of the receptacle,\r\nare carried off. The advantages of this method are that no filtering\r\nmaterial is needed and the filtering surface is never in contact with\r\nanything but pure liquor.\r\n\r\nVery fine sawdust is, to a considerable extent, employed in sugar\r\nrefineries as a filtering medium. By such use the sawdust becomes mixed\r\nwith sand, fine particles of cane, etc. As sawdust of such fineness is\r\nexpensive, it is desirable to purify it in order to reuse it. A\r\ncentrifugal (Pat. 353,775--J.V.V. Booraem) built on the following\r\nprinciple is used for this purpose. It has been observed that by\r\nrotating rather _slowly_ small particles of various substances in\r\nwater, the finer particles will be thrown outward and deposit near the\r\ncircumference of the vessel, while the heavier and coarser particles\r\nwill deposit nearer to or at the center, their centrifugal force not\r\nbeing sufficient to carry them out. A mere rod, extending radially in\r\nboth directions, serves by its rotation to set the water in motion.\r\n\r\nAnother form of filter of this second kind (Pat. 148,513) has a\r\nrotating imperforate basket into which the impure liquor is run. Within\r\nand concentric with it is another cylinder whose walls are of some\r\nfiltering medium. The liquid already partly purified by centrifugal\r\nforce passes through into the inner cylinder, thus becoming further\r\npurified. Centrifugal filters are used also to cleanse gums for\r\nvarnishes.\r\n\r\nHONEY.--The simplest form of honey extractor (Pat. 61,216) consists of\r\na square framework, symmetrical with respect to a vertical spindle.\r\nThis framework is surrounded by a wire gauze. The combs, after having\r\nthe heads of the cells cut off, are placed in comb-holders against the\r\nwire netting on the four sides, the cells pointing outward. The machine\r\nis turned by hand. The honey is hurled against the walls of a receiving\r\ncase and caught below. But few improvements have been made on this. The\r\nlatest machines are still hand-driven, as a sufficiently high velocity\r\ncan be obtained in this manner. In one style the combs are placed upon\r\na floor which rests upon springs. The rotating box is given a slight\r\nvertical and horizontal reciprocatory motion, by which the combs are\r\nmade to grate on the wire gauze sides, breaking the cells and\r\nliberating the honey. Thus the labor of cutting the cells is saved.\r\nEvery comb has two sides, and to present each side in succession to the\r\noutside without removing from the basket, several devices have been\r\npatented. In some the comb holders are hinged in the corners of the\r\nbasket, and have an angular motion of ninety degrees. Decreasing the\r\nspeed is sufficient to swing these. The other side is then emptied by\r\nrevolving in the opposite direction. In one case each holder has a\r\nspindle of its own, connected with the main spindle by gearing and, to\r\npresent opposite side, turns through 180°. The usual number of sides\r\nand hence of comb holders is four, but eight have been used. There are\r\nminor differences in details of construction, looking to the most\r\nconvenient removal and insertion of comb, the reception of the\r\nextracted honey in cups, buckets, etc., and the best method of giving\r\nrapid rotation, which cannot be touched upon. The product of the\r\noperation is white and opaque, but upon heating regains its golden\r\ncolor and transparency.\r\n\r\nSTARCH.--A centrifugal to separate starch from triturated grain,\r\ncarried in suspension in water, is as follows. (Pat. 273,127--Müller &\r\nDecastro.) The starch water is led to the bottom of a basket, and, as\r\nstarch is heavier than the gluten with which it is mixed, the former\r\nwill be immediately compacted against the periphery of the basket,\r\nlodging first in the lower corner, the starch and gluten forming two\r\ndistinct strata. A tube with a cutting edge enters the compacted mass\r\nso deeply as to peel off the gluten and part of the starch, which is\r\ncarried through the tube to another compartment of the basket, just\r\nabove, where the same operation is performed, and so on. There may be\r\nonly one compartment, the tube carrying the gluten directly out of the\r\nmachine. These machines are continuous working, and hence some way must\r\nbe devised to carry the water off. The inner surface of the water is,\r\nas we have seen, a cylinder. When the diameter of this cylinder becomes\r\ntoo small, overflow must be allowed. One plan is to have an overflow\r\nopening made in the bottom of the basket in such a way that as the\r\nstarch wall thickens, the opening recedes toward the center. The starch\r\nwall is either lifted out in cakes or put again in suspension by\r\nspraying water on it and conducting the mixture off.\r\n\r\nA centrifugal (Pat. 74,021) to separate liquids from paints depends on\r\nbuilding a wall of paint on the sides of the basket and carrying the\r\nliquids off at the center.\r\n\r\nA centrifugal (Pat. 310,469) for assorting wood pulp, paper pulp, etc.,\r\nworks by massing the constituents in two or three cylindrical strata,\r\nand after action severing and removing these separately.\r\n\r\nBREWING.--In brewing, centrifugals are quite useful. After the wort has\r\nbeen boiled with hops, albuminous matters are precipitated by the\r\ntannic acid, which must be extracted. Besides these the mixture\r\nfrequently contains husk, fiber, and gluten. The machine (Pat.\r\n315,876), although quite unique in construction, has the same principle\r\nof working as a sugar centrifugal, and need not be described. There is\r\none point, however, which might be noticed--that air is introduced at\r\nabout the same point as the material, and has an oxidizing and\r\nrefrigerating effect.\r\n\r\nClass I. includes also centrifugals for the following purposes: The\r\nremoval of must from the grape after crushing, making butter,\r\nextracting oils from solid fats, separating the liquid and solid parts\r\nof sewerage, drying hides, skins, spent tan and the like, drying coils\r\nof wire.\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL CENTRIFUGALS.--Only vertical machines have been and will be\r\ndealt with. Horizontal centrifugals, that is, those whose spindles are\r\nhorizontal have been made, but the great inconvenience of charging and\r\ndischarging connected with them has occasioned their disuse; though in\r\nother respects for liquids they are quite as good as vertical\r\nseparators. Their underlying theory is practically the same as that\r\nhereinbefore discussed.\r\n\r\nCLASS II., CREAMERS.--Centrifugals of the second class separate liquids\r\nfrom liquids. There are two main applications in this class--to\r\nseparate cream from milk and fusel oil from alcoholic liquors. When a\r\nliquid is to be separated from a liquid, the receptacle must be\r\nimperforate. The components of different specific gravity become\r\narranged in distinct concentric cylindrical strata in the basket, and\r\nmust be conducted away separately. In creamers the particles of cream\r\nmust not be broken or subjected to any concussion, as partial churning\r\nis caused and the cream will, in consequence, sour more rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of oscillations in machines of this class, where the\r\ncharge is liquid, is the waves which form on the inner surface. They\r\nmay be met by allowing a slight overflow over the inner edge of the rim\r\nof the basket; or by having either horizontal partitions, or vertical,\r\nradial ones, special cases of which will be noticed. Oscillations may\r\nalso be met in the same manner as in sugar machines, by allowing the\r\nrevolving parts to revolve about an axis through their common center of\r\ngravity. (Pat. 360,342--J. Evans.)\r\n\r\nThe crudest form of creamer contains a number of bottles, with their\r\nnecks all directed toward the spindle, filled with milk. The necks, in\r\nwhich the cream collects, are graduated to tell when the operation is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nMany methods for introducing the milk into creamers have been devised.\r\nIt may run in from the top at the center, or emerge from a pipe at the\r\nbottom of the basket; or the spindle may be hollow and the milk sucked\r\nup through it from a basin below. It is usual to let the milk enter\r\nunder hydrostatic pressure (Pat. 239,900--D. M. Weston) and let the\r\nforce of expulsion of the cream be dependent on this pressure. This\r\nrenders the escape quiet, and prevents churning. Gravity, too, is made\r\neffective in carrying the constituents off.\r\n\r\nThe cream may escape through a passage in the bottom at the center, and\r\nthe skim milk at the lower outer corner; or by ingeniously managed\r\npassages both may escape at or near center. The rate of discharge can\r\nbe managed by regulating the size of opening of exit passages.\r\n\r\nA curious method consists in having discharge pipes provided with\r\nvalves and floats at their lower ends, dipping into the liquid (Pat.\r\n240,175). \"The valves are opened and closed, or partially opened or\r\nclosed, by the floats attached to them, these floats being so\r\nconstructed and arranged with reference to their specific gravity and\r\nthe specific gravity of the component parts of the liquids operated\r\nupon, that they will permit only a liquid of a determinate specific\r\ngravity to escape through the pipes to which they are respectively\r\nattached.\"\r\n\r\nWe may have tubes directed into the different strata with cutting\r\nedges. (Pat. 288,782.) A remarkable fact noticed in their use is that\r\nthese edges wear as rapidly as if solids were cut instead of liquids.\r\n\r\nThe separated fluids may be received into recessed rings, having\r\ndischarge pipes, the proportionate quantity discharged being regulated\r\nby the proximity of the discharge lips to the surface of the ring, and\r\nthe centrifugal force being availed of to project the liquids through\r\nthe discharge pipes.\r\n\r\nThere is a very simple device by which a very rapid circulation of the\r\nliquid is brought about. (Pat. 358,587--C.A. Backstrom.) The basket has\r\nradial vertical partitions, all but one having communicating holes,\r\nalternately in upper and lower corners. The milk is delivered into the\r\nbasket on one side of this imperforate partition and must travel the\r\nwhole circuit of the basket through these communicating holes, until it\r\nreaches the partition again, and then passes into a discharge pipe.\r\nThus during this long course every particle of cream escapes to the\r\ncenter. As the holes are close to the walls of the basket, the cream\r\nhas not the undulatory motion of the milk, which would injure it. The\r\ngreater the number of partitions, the longer is the travel of the milk,\r\nand the more rapid the circulation. Blades have been devised similar to\r\nthe above, having communicating passages extending the whole width of\r\nthe blade, but we see that here the cream would circulate with the\r\nmilk; which must not be allowed. Curved blades have been used, and\r\npaddles and stirrers, to set the milk in motion, but to them the same\r\nobjection may be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30]\r\n\r\nFig. 30 (Pat. 355,048--C.A. Backstrom) illustrates one of the latest\r\nand best styles of creamers. The milk enters at C. The skim milk passes\r\ninto tube, T, and the cream goes to the center and passes out of the\r\nopenings in the bottom, _k^{l}_, _k^{2}_, and _k^{3}_, out of the slit,\r\nk, and thence out through D^{5}. The skim milk moves through T,\r\nbecoming more thoroughly separated all the while, and at each of the\r\nradial branch tubes, T^{1}, T^{2}, T^{3}, and T^{4}, some cream leaves\r\nit and goes to the center, while it passes down out of slit, t^{3}, and\r\nthence out of D^{6}.\r\n\r\nFig. 31 (Pat. 355,050--C.A. Backstrom) shows another very late style of\r\ncreamer. A pipe delivers the milk into P^{4}. Passing out of the tube\r\nseparation takes place, and cream falls down the center to P^{2} and\r\nout of O^{3}. When the compartment under the first shelf becomes full\r\nof the skim milk, the latter passes up through the slot, S, strikes a\r\nradial partition, R, and its course is reversed. Here more cream\r\nseparates and passes to center and falls directly, and so on through\r\nthe whole series of annular compartments, until the top one, when the\r\nskim milk enters tube T^{2} and passes out of O^{2}. By this operation\r\nthere are substantially repeated subjections of specified quantities of\r\nmilk to the action of centrifugal force, bringing about a thorough\r\nseparation. By changing the course of the milk in direction, its path\r\nis made longer. This machine can run at much lower speed than many\r\nother styles, and yet do the same work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31]\r\n\r\nCLASS III., SOLIDS FROM SOLIDS.--As for grain machines, which are in\r\nthis class, it may be said that in centrifugal flour bolters, bran\r\ncleaners, and middlings purifiers, though theoretically centrifugal\r\nforce plays an important part in their action, yet practically the real\r\nseparation is brought about by other agencies: in some by brushes which\r\nrub the finer particles through wire netting as they rotate against it.\r\n\r\nThe principle exhibited in a separator of grains and seeds is very\r\nneat. (Pat. 167,297.) See Fig. 32. That part of the machine with which\r\nwe have to do consists essentially of a horizontal revolving disk. The\r\nmixed grains are cast on this disk, pass to the edge, and are hurled\r\noff at a tangent. Suppose at A. Each particle is immediately acted on\r\nby three forces. For all particles of the same size and having the same\r\nvelocity the resistance of the air may be taken the same, that is,\r\nproportional to the area presented. The acceleration of gravity is the\r\nsame; but the inertia of the heavier grain is greater. The resultant of\r\nthe two conspiring forces R and (M_v_^{2})/2 varies, and is greater for\r\na heavier grain. Therefore, the paths described in the air will vary,\r\nespecially in length; and how this is utilized the drawing illustrates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nORE.--In ore machines there is one for pulverizing and separating coal\r\n(Pat. 306,544), in which there is a breaker provided with helical\r\nblades or paddles, partaking of rapid rotary motion within a stationary\r\ncylinder of wire netting. The dust, constituting the valuable part of\r\nthe product, is hurled out as fast as formed. In this style of machine,\r\nbeaters are necessary not only for pulverizing, but to get up rotary\r\nmotion for generating centrifugal force. In the classes preceding, the\r\nfriction of the basket sufficed for this latter purpose; but here there\r\nis no rotating basket and no definite charge. As the material falls\r\nthrough the machine, separation takes place. Various kinds of ore may\r\nbe treated in the same manner.\r\n\r\nAn \"ore concentrator\" (Pat. 254,123), as it is called, consists of a\r\npan having rotary and oscillatory motions. Crushed ore is delivered\r\nover the edge in water. The heavy particles of the metal are thrown by\r\ncentrifugal force against the rim of the pan, overcoming the force of\r\nthe water, which carries the sand and other impurities in toward the\r\ncenter and away.\r\n\r\nAMALGAMATORS.--The best ore centrifugal or separator is what is called\r\nan \"amalgamator.\" The last invention (Pat. 355,958, White) consists\r\nessentially of a pan, a meridian section of which would give a curve\r\nwhose normal at any point is in the direction of the resultant of the\r\ncentrifugal force at that point and gravity. There is a cover to this\r\npan whose convexity almost fits the concavity of the pan, leaving a\r\nspace of about an inch between. Crushed ore with water is admitted at\r\nthe center between the cover and the pan, and is driven by centrifugal\r\nforce through a mass of mercury (which occupies part of this space\r\nbetween the two) and out over the edge of the pan. The particles of\r\nmetal coming in contact with the mercury amalgamate, and as the speed\r\nis regulated so that it is never great enough to hurl the mercury out,\r\nnothing but sand, water, etc., escape. There have been many different\r\nconstructions devised, but this general principle runs through all. By\r\nhaving annular flanges running down from the cover with openings placed\r\nalternately, the mixture is compelled to follow a tortuous course, thus\r\ngiving time for all the gold or other metal to become amalgamated.\r\nThere are ridges in the pan, too, against which the amalgam lodges. It\r\nis claimed for this machine that not a particle of the precious metal\r\nis lost, and experiments seem to uphold the claim.\r\n\r\nA machine for separating fine from coarse clay for porcelain or for\r\nseparating the finer quality of plumbago from the coarser for lead\r\npencils uses an imperforate basket, against the wall of which the\r\ncoarser part banks and catches under the rim. The finer part forms an\r\ninner cylindrical stratum, but is allowed to spill over the edge of the\r\nrim. The mixture is introduced at the bottom of the basket at the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nCLASS IV., GASES AND SOLIDS.--There is a very simple contrivance\r\nillustrating machines of this class used to free air from dust or other\r\nheavy solid impurities which may be in suspension. See Fig. 33. The air\r\nenters the passage, B (if it has no considerable velocity of itself, it\r\nmust be forced in), forms a whirlpool in the conically shaped\r\nreceptable, A, and passes up out of the passage, D. The heavy particles\r\nare thrown on the sides and collect there and fall through opening, C,\r\ninto some closed receiver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33]\r\n\r\nCLASS V., GASES AND LIQUIDS.--The occluded gases in steel and other\r\nmetal castings, if not separated, render the castings more or less\r\nporous. This separation is effected by subjecting the molten metal to\r\nthe action of centrifugal force under exclusion of air, producing not\r\nonly the most minute division of the particles, but also a vacuum, both\r\nfavorable conditions for obtaining a dense metal casting.\r\n\r\nMost of the devices for drying steam come under this head. Such are\r\nthose in which the steam with the water in suspension is forced to take\r\na circular path, by which the water is hurled by centrifugal force\r\nagainst the concave side of the passage and passes back to the water in\r\nthe boiler.\r\n\r\nSPEED.--The centrifugal force of a revolving particle varies, as we\r\nhave seen, as the square of the angular velocity, so that the effort\r\nhas been to obtain as high a number of revolutions per minute as was\r\nconsistent with safety and with the principle of the machine. For\r\nexample, creamers which are small and light make 4,000 revolutions per\r\nminute, though the latest styles run much more slowly. Driers and sugar\r\nmachines vary from 600 to 2,000, while on the other hand the necessity\r\nof keeping the mercury from hurling off in an amalgamator prevents its\r\nturning more rapidly than sixty or eighty times a minute.\r\n\r\nHowever, speed in another sense, the speed with which the operation is\r\nperformed, is what especially characterizes centrifugal extractors. In\r\nthis particular a contrast between the old methods and the new is\r\nimpressive. Under the action of gravity, cream rises to the milk's\r\nsurface, but compare the hours necessary for this to the almost\r\ninstantaneous separation in a centrifugal creamer. The sugar\r\nmanufacturer trusted to gravity to drain the sirup from his crystals,\r\nbut the operation was long and at best imperfect. An average sugar\r\ncentrifugal will separate 600 pounds of magma perfectly in three\r\nminutes. Gold quartz which formerly could not pay for its mining is now\r\nmaking its owners' fortunes. It is boasted by a Southern company that\r\nwhereas they were by old methods making twenty-five _cents_ per ton of\r\ngold quartz, they now by the use of the latest amalgamator make\r\ntwenty-five _dollars_. Centrifugal force, as applied in extractors, has\r\nopened up new industries and enlarged old ones, has lowered prices and\r\nadded to our comforts, and centrifugal extractors may well command, as\r\nthey do, the admiration of all as wonderful examples of the way in\r\nwhich this busy age economizes time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW TYPE OF RAILWAY CAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--CAR WITH LATERAL PASSAGEWAYS.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 1 and 2 give a perspective view and plan of a new style of car\r\nrecently adopted by the Bone-Guelma Railroad Company, and which has\r\nisolated compartments opening upon a lateral passageway. In this\r\narrangement, which is due to Mr. Desgranges, the lateral passageway\r\ndoes not extend all along one side of the car, but passes through the\r\ncenter of the latter and then runs along the opposite side so as to\r\nform a letter S.

The two ends are provided with platforms that are reached by\r\nmeans of steps, and that permit one to enter the corresponding half of\r\nthe car or to pass on to the next. The length from end to end is 33\r\nfeet in the mixed cars, comprising two first-class and four\r\nsecond-class compartments, and 32 feet in cars of the third class,\r\nwith six compartments. The width of the compartments is 5.6 and 5\r\nfeet, according to the class. The passageway is 28 inches in width in\r\nthe mixed cars, and 24 in those of the third class.

The superstructure is in two distinct portions,\r\nseparated by a point of high ground. The main portion, extending\r\nacross the river valley from Hill street to Jennings avenue, is 2,840\r\nfeet long on the floor line, including the river bridge, a swing 233\r\nfeet in length; the other portion, crossing Walworth run from Davidson\r\nstreet to Abbey street, is 1,093 feet long. Add to these the earthwork\r\nand masonry approaches, 1,415 feet long, and we have a total length of\r\n5,348 feet. The width of roadway is 40 feet, sidewalks 8 feet each.\r\nThe elevation of the roadway above the water level at the river\r\ncrossing is 102 feet. The superstructure is of wrought iron, mainly\r\ntrapezoidal trusses, varying in length from 45 feet to 150 feet. The\r\nriver piers are of first-class masonry, on pile and timber foundations.\r\nThe other supports of the viaduct are wrought iron trestles on masonry\r\npiers, resting on broad concrete foundations. The pressure on the\r\nmaterial beneath the concrete, which is plastic blue clay of varying\r\ndegrees of stiffness mixed with fine sand, is about one ton per square\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe Cuyahoga valley, which the viaduct crosses from bluff to bluff, is\r\ncomposed mainly of blue clay to a depth of over 150 feet below the\r\nriver level. No attempt is made to carry the foundation to the rock.\r\nWhite oak piles from 50 to 60 feet in length and 10 inches in diameter\r\nat small end are driven for the bridge piers either side of the river\r\nbed, and these are cut off with a circular saw 18 feet below the\r\nsurface of the water. Excavation by dredging was made to a depth of 3\r\nfeet below where the piles are cut off to allow for the rising of the\r\nclay during the driving of the piles. The piles are spaced about 2\r\nfeet 5 inches each way, center to center. The grillage or platform\r\ncovering the piles consists of 14 courses of white oak timber, 12\r\ninches by 12 inches, having a few pine timbers interspersed so as to\r\nallow the mass to float during construction. The lower half of the\r\nplatform was built on shore, care being taken to keep the lower\r\nsurface of the mass of timber out of wind. The upper and lower\r\nsurfaces of each timber were dressed in a Daniels planer, and all\r\npieces in the same course were brought to a uniform thickness. The\r\ntimbers in adjacent courses are at right angles to each other. The\r\nlower course is about 58 feet by 22 feet, the top course about 50 by\r\n24 feet, thus allowing four steps of one foot each all around. The\r\nfirst course of masonry is 48 feet by 21 feet 8 inches; the first\r\ncourse of battered work is 41 feet 8½ inches by 16 feet 3 inches. Thus\r\nthe area of the platform on the piles is 1,856 square feet, and of the\r\nfirst batter course of masonry 777.6 square feet, or in the ratio of\r\n2.4 to 1. The height of the masonry is 78 feet above the timber, or\r\n73½ feet above the water. The number of piles in each foundation is\r\n312. The average load per pile is about 11 tons, and the estimated\r\npressure per square inch of the timber on the heads of the piles is\r\nabout 200 pounds.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the submersion of the lower courses of masonry during\r\nconstruction, temporary sides of timber were drift-bolted to the\r\nmargin of the upper course of the timber platform, and carried high\r\nenough to be above the surface of the water when the platform was sunk\r\nto the head of the piles by the increasing weight of masonry.\r\n\r\nThe center pier is octagonal, and is built in the same general manner\r\nas to foundations as the shore piers, but the piles are cut off 22\r\nfeet below water, and there are eighteen courses of timber in the\r\ngrillage. The diameter of the platform between parallel sides is 53\r\nfeet, while that of the lower course of battered masonry is but 37\r\nfeet. The areas are as 2,332 to 1,147, or as 2 to 1 nearly. The\r\npressure per square inch of timber on the heads of the piles is about\r\nthe same as stated above for the shore piers. The number of piles\r\nunder the center pier is 483.\r\n\r\nThe risks and delays by this method of constructing the foundations\r\nwere much less, and the cost also, than if an ordinary coffer dam had\r\nbeen used. Also the total weight of the piers is much less, as that\r\nportion below a point about two feet below the water adds nothing to\r\ntheir weight.\r\n\r\nThe piles were driven with a Cram steam hammer weighing two tons, in a\r\nframe weighing also two tons. The iron frame rests directly upon the\r\nhead of the pile and goes down with it. The fall of the hammer is\r\nabout 40 inches before striking the pile. The total penetration of the\r\npiles into the clay averaged 27 feet. The settlement of the pile\r\nduring the final strokes of the hammer varied from one quarter to\r\nthree quarters of an inch per blow.\r\n\r\nThere are 122 masonry pedestals, of which eight are large and heavy,\r\ncarrying spans of considerable length. They will all be built upon\r\nconcrete beds, except a few near the river on the north side, where\r\npiles are required.\r\n\r\nThe four abutments with their retaining walls are of first-class\r\nrock-faced masonry. The footing courses are stepped out liberally, so\r\nas to present an unusually large bottom surface. They rest on beds of\r\nconcrete 4 feet thick. The foundation pits are about 50 feet below the\r\ntop of the bluffs, and are in a material common to the Cleveland\r\nplateau, a mixture of blue sand and clay, with some water. The\r\nestimated load of masonry on the earth at the bottom of the concrete\r\nis one and seven tenths tons to the square foot. Two of the large\r\nabutments were completed last season. They show an average settlement\r\nof three eighths of an inch since the lower footing courses were laid.\r\n\r\nThe facts and figures here given regarding the viaduct were kindly\r\nfurnished by the city civil engineer, C.G. Force, who has the work in\r\ncharge.--_Jour. Asso. of Eng.

CORNELIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December, 1883, bids were asked for by the United States government\r\non pumping machinery, to remove the water from a dry dock for vessels\r\nof large size.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the dock, which is situated on San Pablo Bay,\r\ndirectly opposite the city of Vallejo, are as follows:\r\n\r\nFive hundred and twenty-nine feet wide at its widest part, 36 feet\r\ndeep, with a capacity at mean tide of 9,000,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the contract, several different sizes of pumps were\r\nconsidered, but the following dimensions were finally chosen: Two 42\r\ninch centrifugal pumps, with runner 66 inches in diameter and\r\ndischarge pipes 42 inches, each driven direct by a vertical engine\r\nwith 28 inch diameter cylinder and 24 inch stroke.\r\n\r\nThese were completed and shipped in June, 1885, on nine cars,\r\nconstituting a special train, which arrived safely at its destination\r\nin the short space of two weeks, and the pumps were there erected on\r\nfoundations prepared by the government.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Report of the Chief of Bureau of Yards and Docks\" I quote\r\nthe following account of the official tests:\r\n\r\n     \"The board appointed to make the test resolved to fill the\r\n     dock to about the level that would attain in actual service\r\n     with a naval ship of second rate in the dock, and the tide at\r\n     a stage which would give the minimum pumping necessary to\r\n     free the dock. The level of the 20th altar was considered as\r\n     the proper point, and the water was admitted through two of\r\n     the gates of the caisson until this level was reached; they\r\n     were then closed. The contents of the dock at this point is\r\n     5,963,921 gallons.\r\n\r\n     \"The trial was commenced and continued to completion without\r\n     any interruption in a very satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n     \"In the separate trials had of each pump, the average\r\n     discharge per minute was taken of the whole process, and\r\n     there was a singular uniformity throughout with equal piston\r\n     speed of the engine.\r\n\r\n     \"It was to be expected, and in a measure realized, that\r\n     during the first moments of the operations, when the level of\r\n     the water in the dock was above the center of the runner of\r\n     the pumps, that the discharge would be proportioned to the\r\n     work done, where no effort was necessary to maintain a free\r\n     and full flow through the suction pipes; but as the level\r\n     passed lower and farther away from the center there was no\r\n     apparent diminution of the flow, and no noticeable addition\r\n     to the load imposed on the engine. The variation in piston\r\n     speed, noted during the trial, was probably due to the\r\n     variation of the boiler pressure, as it was difficult to\r\n     preserve an equal pressure, as it rose in spite of great\r\n     care, owing to the powerful draught and easy steaming\r\n     qualities of the boilers.\r\n\r\n     \"After the trial of the second pump had been completed the\r\n     dock was again filled through the caisson, and as both pumps\r\n     were to be tried, the water was admitted to a level with the\r\n     23d altar, containing 7,317,779 gallons, which was seven feet\r\n     above the center of the pumps; this was in favor of the pumps\r\n     for the reasons before stated. In this case all the boilers\r\n     were used.\r\n\r\n     \"Everything moved most admirably, and the performance of\r\n     these immense machines was almost startling. By watching the\r\n     water in the dock it could be seen to lower bodily, and so\r\n     rapidly that it could be detected by the eye without\r\n     reference to any fixed point.\r\n\r\n     \"The well which communicates with the suction tunnel was\r\n     open, and the water would rise and fall, full of rapid swirls\r\n     and eddies, though far above the entrance of these tunnels.\r\n     Through the man hole in the discharge culvert the issuance\r\n     from the pipes could be seen, and its volume was beyond\r\n     conception. It flowed rapidly through the culvert, and its\r\n     outfall was a solid prism of water, the full size of the\r\n     tunnel, projecting far into the river.\r\n\r\n     \"During a pumping period of 55 minutes, the dock had been\r\n     emptied from the twenty-third to two inches above the sixth\r\n     altar, containing 6,210,698 gallons, an average throughout of\r\n     112,922 gallons per minute. At one time, when the revolutions\r\n     were increased to 160 per minute, the discharge was 137,797\r\n     gallons per minute. This is almost a river, and is hardly\r\n     conceivable. After the pumps were stopped, on this occasion,\r\n     tests were made with each in succession as to the power of\r\n     the ejectors with which each is fitted to recharge the pumps.\r\n\r\n     \"The valves in the discharge pipe were closed and steam\r\n     admitted to the ejector, the pump being still and no water in\r\n     the gauge glass on the pump casing, which must be full before\r\n     the pumps will work. The suction pipe of the ejector is only\r\n     two and a half inches in diameter, the steam pipe one inch in\r\n     diameter. To fully charge the pumps at this point required\r\n     filling the pump casing and the suction pipe containing about\r\n     2,000 gallons; this was accomplished in four minutes, and\r\n     when the gauge glass was full the pump operated instantly and\r\n     with certainty, discharging its full volume of water.\r\n\r\n     \"I went on several occasions down in the valve pits on the\r\n     ladder of the casing, and to all accessible parts while in\r\n     motion at its highest speed, and there was no undue\r\n     vibration, only a uniform murmur of well-balanced parts, and\r\n     the peculiar clash of water against the sides of the casing\r\n     as its velocity was checked by the blank spaces in the\r\n     runner.\r\n\r\n     \"The pumps are noisy while at work, due to the clashing of\r\n     the water just mentioned, but it affords a means of detecting\r\n     any faulty arrangements of the runner or unequal discharge\r\n     from any of its openings. While moving at a uniform speed,\r\n     this clashing has a tone whose pitch corresponds with that\r\n     velocity of discharge, and if this tone is lacking in\r\n     quality, or at all confused, there is want of equality of\r\n     discharge through the various openings of the runner. To this\r\n     part I gave close attention, and there was nothing that the\r\n     ear could detect to indicate aught but the nicest adjustment.\r\n     The bearings of the runners worked with great smoothness, and\r\n     did not become at all heated. Through a simple, novel\r\n     arrangement, these bearings are lubricated and kept cool.\r\n     There is a constant circulation of water from the pumps by\r\n     means of a small pipe, which completes a circuit to an\r\n     annular in the bearings back to the discharge pipe while the\r\n     pump is in motion, requiring no oil and making it seemingly\r\n     impossible to heat these bearings.\r\n\r\n     \"The large cast steel valves placed in the embouchement of\r\n     the casing, it was thought, might act to check the free\r\n     discharge, and arrangements were provided for raising and\r\n     keeping them open by a long lever key attached to their axes\r\n     of revolution, but, to our great surprise, at the first gush\r\n     from the pumps these valves, weighing nearly 1,500 pounds,\r\n     were lifted into their recessed chambers, giving an\r\n     unobstructed opening to the flow, and they floated on its\r\n     surface unsupported, save by the swiftly flowing water,\r\n     without a movement, while the pump was in operation.\r\n\r\n     \"The steam-actuated valves in the suction and discharge pipes\r\n     worked very well, and the water cushion gave a slow, uniform\r\n     motion, and without shock, either in opening or closing them.\r\n\r\n     \"The engines worked noiselessly, without shock or labor. At\r\n     no time during the trial was the throttle valve open more\r\n     than three-eighths of an inch.\r\n\r\n     \"The indicator cards taken at various intervals gave 796\r\n     horse power, and the revolutions did not exceed 160 at any\r\n     time, though it was estimated that 900 horse power and 210\r\n     revolutions would be necessary to attain the requisite\r\n     delivery. So that there is a large reserve of power available\r\n     at any time.\r\n\r\n     \"The erection of this massive machinery has been admirably\r\n     done. The parts, as sent from the shops of the contractor,\r\n     have matched in all cases without interference here; and,\r\n     when lowered into place, its final adjustment was then made\r\n     without the use of chisel or file, and has never been touched\r\n     since.\r\n\r\n     \"The joints of the steam and water connections were perfect,\r\n     and the method of concentrating all valves, waste pipes, and\r\n     important movements at the post of the engineer in charge\r\n     gives him complete control of the whole system of each engine\r\n     and pump without leaving his place, and reduces to a minimum\r\n     the necessary attendance. All the parts are strong and of\r\n     excellent design and workmanship; simple, and without\r\n     ornamentation.\r\n\r\n     \"Looking down upon them from a level of the pump house\r\n     gallery, they are impressive and massive in their simplicity.\r\n\r\n     \"The government is well worth of congratulation in possessing\r\n     the largest pumping machinery of this type and of the\r\n     greatest capacity in the world, and the contractors have\r\n     reason to be proud of their work.\"--_Proc.

Though, in the play of _affinity_,\r\nthere is a manifestation of electricity, is it the same with\r\n_cohesion_, which also is a chemical force?\r\n\r\nWe know, on another hand, that, on causing electricity to intervene,\r\nwe bring about the crystallization of a large number of substances.\r\nBut is the converse true? Is spontaneous crystallization accompanied\r\nwith an appreciable manifestation of electricity? If we consult the\r\nannals of science and works treating on electricity in regard to this\r\nsubject, we find very few examples and experiments proper to elucidate\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nMr. Mascart is content to say: \"Some experiments seem to indicate that\r\nthe solidification of a body produces electricity.\" Mr. Becquerel does\r\nmore than doubt--he denies: \"As regards the disengagement of\r\nelectricity in the changing of the state of bodies, we find none.\"\r\nThis assertion is too sweeping, for further along we shall cite facts\r\nthat prove, on the contrary, that in the phenomena of crystallization\r\n(to speak of this change of state only) there is an unequivocal\r\nproduction of electricity. Let us remark, in the first place, that\r\nwhen a number of phenomena of physical and chemical order\r\nincontestably testify to the very intimate correlation that exists\r\nbetween the molecular motions of bodies and their electrical state, it\r\nwould not be very logical to grant that electricity is absent in\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\nThus, to select an example from among physical effects, the vibratory\r\nphenomena that occur in telephone transmissions, under the influence\r\nof a very feeble electric current, show us that the molecular\r\nconstitution of a solid body is extremely variable, although within\r\nslight limits. The feeblest modification in the electric current may\r\nbe shown by molecular motions capable of propagating themselves to\r\nconsiderable distances in the conducting wire. Conversely, it is\r\nlogical to suppose that a modification in the molecular state of a\r\nbody must bring electricity into play. If, in the phenomena of\r\nsolidification, and particularly of crystallization, we collect but\r\nsmall quantities of electricity, that may be due to the fact that,\r\nunder the experimental conditions involved, the electricity is more or\r\nless completely absorbed by the work of crystal building.\r\n\r\nOn another hand, the behavior of electricity shows in advance the\r\nmultiple role that this agent may play in the various physical,\r\nchemical, and mechanical phenomena.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that electricity exists immovable or in circulation\r\neverywhere, latent or imperceptible, around us, and within ourselves,\r\nand that it enters as a cause into the majority of the chemical,\r\nphysical, and mechanical phenomena that are constantly taking place\r\nbefore our eyes. A body cannot change state, nature, temperature,\r\nform, or place, even, without electricity being brought into play, and\r\nwithout its accompanying such modifications, if it presides therein.\r\nLike heat, it is _the_ natural agent _par excellence_; it is the\r\ninvisible and ever present force which, in the ultimate particles of\r\nmatter, causes those motions, vibrations, and rotations that have the\r\neffect of changing the properties of bodies. Upon entering their\r\nintimate structure, it orients or groups their atoms, and separates\r\ntheir molecules or brings them together. From this, would it not be\r\nsurprising if it did not intervene in the wonderful phenomenon of\r\ncrystallization? Crystallization, in fact, depends upon _cohesion_,\r\nand, in the thermic theory, this force is not distinct from affinity,\r\njust as solution and dissociation are not distinct from combination.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, it is necessary to say that, between affinity, heat,\r\nand electricity there is such a correlation, such a dependency, that\r\nphysicists have endeavored to reduce to one single principle all the\r\ncauses that are now distinct. The mechanical theory of heat has made a\r\ngreat stride in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe equivalence of the thermic, mechanical and chemical forces has\r\nbeen demonstrated; the only question hereafter will be to select from\r\namong such forces the one that must be adopted as the sole principle,\r\nin order to account for all the phenomena that depend upon these\r\ncauses of various orders. But in the present state of science, it is\r\nnot yet possible to explain completely by heat or electricity, taken\r\nisolatedly, all the effects dependent upon the causes just mentioned.\r\nWe must confine ourselves for the present to a study of the relations\r\nthat exist between the principal natural forces--affinity, molecular\r\nforces, heat, electricity, and light. But from the mutual dependence\r\nof such forces, it is admitted that, in every natural phenomenon,\r\nthere is a more or less apparent simultaneous concurrence of these\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain electric or magnetic phenomena, and also those of\r\ncrystallization, it is admitted that the atoms of which bodies are\r\ncomposed are surrounded, each of them, with a sort of atmosphere\r\nformed of electric currents, owing to which these atoms are attracted\r\nor repelled on certain sides, and produce those varied effects that we\r\nobserve under different circumstances. According to this theory, then,\r\natoms would be small electro-magnets behaving like genuine magnets.\r\nEntirely free in gases, but less so in liquids and still less so in\r\nsolids, they are nevertheless capable of arranging themselves and of\r\nbecoming polarized in a regular order, special to each kind of atom,\r\nin order to produce crystals of geometrical form characteristic of\r\neach species. Thus, as Mr. Saigey remarks in \"Physique Moderne\" (p.\r\n181): \"So long as the atmospheres of the molecules do not touch each\r\nother, no trace of cohesion manifests itself; but as soon as they come\r\ntogether force is born. We understand why the temperatures of fusion\r\nand solidification are fixed for the same body. Such effects occur at\r\nthe precise moment at which these atmospheres, which are variable with\r\nthe temperature, have reached the desired diameter.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 1., 2., and 3.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the phenomenon of crystallization does not essentially depend\r\nupon temperature, but rather upon the relative quantity of liquid that\r\nholds the substance in solution, it will be conceived that a moment\r\nwill arrive when, the liquid having evaporated, the atmospheres will\r\nbe close enough to each other to attract each other and become\r\npolarized and symmetrically juxtaposed, and, in a word, to\r\ncrystallize.\r\n\r\nBefore giving examples of the production of electricity in the\r\nphenomenon of crystallization, it will be well to examine, beforehand,\r\nthe different circumstances under which electricity acts as the\r\ndetermining cause of crystallization or intervenes among the causes\r\nthat bring about the phenomenon. In the first place, two words\r\nconcerning crystallization itself: We know that crystallization is the\r\npassage, or rather the result of the passage, of a body from a liquid\r\nor gaseous state to a solid one. It occurs when the substance has lost\r\nits cohesion through any cause whatever, and when, such cause ceasing\r\nto act, the body slowly returns to a solid state.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, it may take on regular, geometrical forms\r\ncalled crystalline. Such conditions are brought about by different\r\nprocesses--fusion, volatilization, solution, the dry way, wet way, and\r\nelectric way. Further along, we shall give some examples of the last\r\nnamed means.\r\n\r\nLet us add that crystallization may be regarded as a general property\r\nof bodies, for the majority of substances are capable of\r\ncrystallizing. Although certain bodies seem to be amorphous at first\r\nsight, it is only necessary to examine their fracture with a lens or\r\nmicroscope to see that they are formed of a large number of small\r\njuxtaposed crystals. Many amorphous precipitates become crystalline in\r\nthe long run.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of the various crystallizations that occupy us, we\r\nshall distinguish the following: (1) Those that are produced through\r\nthe direct intervention of the electric current; (2) those in which\r\nelectricity is manifestly produced by small voltaic couples resulting\r\nfrom the presence of two different metals in the solution experimented\r\nwith; (3) those in which there are no voltaic couples, but in which it\r\nis proved that electricity is one of the causes that concur in the\r\nproduction of the phenomenon; (4) finally, those in which it is\r\nrational, through analogy with the preceding, to infer that\r\nelectricity is not absent from the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nI. We know that, by means of voltaic electricity or induction, we can\r\ncrystallize a large number of substances.\r\n\r\nDespretz tried this means for months at a time upon carbon, either by\r\nusing the electricity from a Ruhmkorff coil or the current from a weak\r\nDaniell's battery. In both cases, he obtained on the platinum wires a\r\nblack powder, in which were found very small octohedral crystals,\r\nhaving the property of polishing rubies rapidly and perfectly--a\r\nproperty characteristic of diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe use of voltaic apparatus of high tension has allowed Mr. Cross to\r\nform a large number of mineral substances artificially, and among\r\nthese we may mention carbonate of lime, arragonite, quartz, arseniate\r\nof copper, crystalline sulphur, etc.\r\n\r\nAs regards products formed with the concurrence of electricity\r\n(oxides, sulphides, chlorides, iodides, etc.), see \"Des Forces\r\nPhysico-Chimiques,\" by Becquerel (p. 231).\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt as to the part played by electricity in the chemical\r\neffects of electro-metallurgy, but it will not prove useless for our\r\nsubject to remark that when, in this operation, the current has become\r\ntoo weak, the deposit of metal, instead of forming in a thin,\r\nadherent, and uniform layer, sometimes occurs under the form of\r\nprotuberances and crystalline, brittle nodules. When, on the contrary,\r\nthe current is very strong, the deposit is pulverulent, that is, in a\r\nconfused crystallization or in an amorphous state.\r\n\r\nFurther along, we shall find an application of this remark. We obtain,\r\nmoreover, all the intermediate effects of cohesion, form, and color of\r\ngalvanic deposits.\r\n\r\nWhen, into a solution of acetate of lead, we pass a current through\r\ntwo platinum electrodes, we observe the formation, at the negative\r\npole, of numerous arborizations of metallic lead that grow under the\r\nobserver's eye (Fig. 1). The phenomenon is of a most interesting\r\ncharacter when, by means of solar or electric light, we project these\r\nbrilliant vegetations on a screen. One might believe that he was\r\nwitness of the rapid growth of a plant (Fig. 2). The same phenomenon\r\noccurs none the less brilliantly with a solution of nitrate of silver.\r\nA large number of saline solutions are adapted to these\r\ndecompositions, in which the metal is laid bare under a crystalline\r\nform. Further along we shall see another means of producing analogous\r\nramifications, without the direct use of the electric current.--_C.\r\nDecharme, in La Lumiere Electrique._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC TIME.\r\n\r\nBy M. LIPPMANN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unit of time universally adopted, the second, undergoes only very\r\nslow secular variations, and can be determined with a precision and an\r\nease which compel its employment. Still it is true that the second is\r\nan arbitrary and a variable unit--arbitrary, in as far as it has no\r\nrelation with the properties of matter, with physical constants;\r\nvariable, since the duration of the diurnal movement undergoes causes\r\nof secular perturbation, some of which, such as the friction of the\r\ntides, are not as yet calculable.\r\n\r\nWe may ask if it is possible to define an absolutely invariable unit\r\nof time; it would be desirable to determine with sufficient precision,\r\nif only once in a century, the relation of the second to such a unit,\r\nso that we might verify the variations of the second indirectly and\r\nindependently of any astronomical hypothesis.\r\n\r\nNow, the study of certain electrical phenomena furnishes a unit of\r\ntime which is absolutely invariable, as this magnitude is a specific\r\nconstant. Let us consider a conductive substance which may always be\r\nfound identical with itself, and to fix our ideas let us choose\r\nmercury, taken at the temperature of 0° C., which completely fulfills\r\nthis condition. We may determine by several methods the specific\r\nelectric resistance, [rho], of mercury in absolute electrostatic\r\nunits; [rho] is a specific property of mercury, and is consequently a\r\nmagnitude absolutely invariable. Moreover, [rho] is _an interval of\r\ntime_. We might, therefore, take [rho] as a unit of time, unless we\r\nprefer to consider this value as an imperishable standard of time.\r\n\r\nIn fact, [rho] is not simply a quantity the measure of which is found\r\nto be in relation with the measure of time. It is a concrete interval\r\nof time, disregarding every convention established with reference to\r\nmeasures and every selection of unit. It may at first sight, appear\r\nsingular that an interval of time is found in a manner hidden under\r\nthe designation _electric resistance_. But we need merely call to mind\r\nthat in the electrostatic system the intensities of the current are\r\nspeeds of efflux and that the resistances are times, i.e., the times\r\nnecessary for the efflux of the electricity under given conditions. We\r\nmust, in particular, remember what is meant by the specific\r\nresistance, [rho] of mercury in the electrostatic system. If we\r\nconsider a circuit having a resistance equal to that of a cube of\r\nmercury, the side of which = the unit of length, the circuit being\r\nsubmitted to an electromotive force equal to unity, this circuit will\r\ntake a given time to be traversed by the unit quantity of electricity,\r\nand this time is precisely [rho]. It must be remarked that the\r\nselection of the unit of length, like that of the unit of mass, is\r\nindifferent, for the different units brought here into play depend on\r\nit in such a manner that [rho] is not affected.\r\n\r\nIt is now required to bring this definition experimentally into\r\naction, i.e., to realize an interval of time which may be a known\r\nmultiple of [rho]. This problem may be solved in various ways,[1] and\r\nespecially by means of the following apparatus.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: In this system the measurement of time is not\r\n    effected, as ordinarily, by observing the movements of a\r\n    material system, but by experiments of equilibrium. All the\r\n    parts of the apparatus remain immovable, the electricity alone\r\n    being in motion. Such appliances are in a manner clepsydræ. This\r\n    analogy with the clepsydræ will be perceived if we consider the\r\n    form of the following experiment: Two immovable metallic plates\r\n    constitute the armatures of a charged condenser, and attract\r\n    each other with a force, F. If the plates are insulated, these\r\n    charges remain constant, as well as the force, F. If, on the\r\n    contrary, we connect the armatures of resistance, R, their\r\n    charges diminish and the force, F, becomes a function of the\r\n    time, _t_; the time, _t_, inversely becomes a function of P. We\r\n    find _t_ by the following formula:\r\n\r\n        t = [rho] × (lS / S[pi]es) × log hyp(F0/F)\r\n\r\n    F0 and F being the values of the force at the beginning and\r\n    at the end of the time, _t_. The above formula is independent of\r\n    the choice of units. If we wish _t_ to be expressed in seconds,\r\n    we must give [rho] the corresponding value ([rho] = 1.058 X\r\n    10^-16). If we take [rho] as a unit we make [rho] = 1, and we\r\n    find the absolute value of the time by the expression:\r\n\r\n        (lS) / (8[pi]es) log hyp(F0/F)\r\n\r\n    We remark that this expression of time contains only abstract\r\n    numbers, being independent of the choice of the units of length\r\n    and force. S and _e_ denote surface and the thickness of the\r\n    condenser; _s_ and _l_ the section and the length of a column of\r\n    mercury of the resistance, R. This form of apparatus enables us\r\n    practically to measure the notable values of _t_ only if the\r\n    value of the resistance, R, is enormous, the arrangement\r\n    described in the text has not the same inconvenience.]\r\n\r\nA battery of an arbitrary electromotive force, E, actuates at the same\r\ntime the two antagonistic circuits of a differential galvanometer. In\r\nthe first circuit, which has a resistance, R, the battery sends a\r\ncontinuous current of the intensity, I; in the second circuit the\r\nbattery sends a discontinuous series of discharges, obtained by\r\ncharging periodically by means of the battery a condenser of the\r\ncapacity, C, which is then discharged through this second circuit. The\r\nneedle of the galvanometer remains in equilibrium if the two currents\r\nyield equal quantities of electricity during one and the same time,\r\n[tau].\r\n\r\nLet us suppose this condition of equilibrium realized and the needle\r\nremaining motionless at zero; it is easy to write the conditions of\r\nequilibrium. During the time, [tau], the continuous current yields a\r\n                           E\r\nquantity of electricity = -- [tau]; on the other hand, each charge of\r\n                           R\r\nthe condenser = CE, and during the time, [tau], the number of\r\n             [tau]\r\ndischarges = -----, t being the fixed time between two discharges;\r\n               t\r\n[tau] and t are here supposed to be expressed by the aid of an\r\narbitrary unit of time; the second circuit yields, therefore, a\r\n                                      [tau]\r\nquantity of electricity equal to CE × -----. The condition of\r\n                                        t\r\n                      E              [tau]\r\nequilibrium is then  ---[tau] = CE × ----- ; or, more simply, t = CR.\r\n                      R                t\r\nC and R are known in absolute values, i.e., we know that C is equal to\r\n_p_ times the capacity of a sphere of the radius, _l_; we have,\r\ntherefore, C = _pl_; in the same manner we know that R is equal to _q_\r\ntimes the resistance of a cube of mercury having l for its side. We\r\n                             l      [rho]\r\nhave, therefore, R = q[rho] --- = q ----- ; and consequently t = pq[rho].\r\n                             l²       l\r\n\r\nSuch is the value of _t_ obtained on leaving all the units\r\nundetermined. If we express [rho] as a function of the second, we have\r\n_t_ in seconds. If we take [rho] = 1, we have the absolute value\r\n[Theta] of the same interval of time as a function of this unit; we\r\nhave simply [Theta] = _pq_.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose that the commutator which produces the successive\r\ncharges and discharges of the condenser consists of a vibrating tuning\r\nfork, we see that the duration of a vibration is equal to the product\r\nof the two abstract numbers, _pq_.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us to ascertain to what degree of approximation we can\r\ndetermine _p_ and _q_. To find _q_ we must first construct a column of\r\nmercury of known dimensions; this problem was solved by the\r\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures for the construction of\r\nthe legal ohm. The legal ohm is supposed to have a resistance equal to\r\n106.00 times that of a cube of mercury of 0.01 meter, side\r\nmeasurement. The approximation obtained is comprised between 1/50000\r\nand 1/200000. To obtain _p_, we must be able to construct a plane\r\ncondenser of known capacity. The difficulty here consists in knowing\r\nwith a sufficient approximation the thickness of the stratum of air.\r\nWe may employ as armatures two surfaces of glass, ground optically,\r\nsilvered to render them conductive, but so slightly as to obtain by\r\ntransparence Fizeau's interference rings. Fizeau's method will then\r\npermit us to arrive at a close approximation. In fine, then, we may,\r\n_a priori_, hope to reach an approximation of one hundred-thousandth\r\nof the value of _pq_.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the use which may be made of it for measuring time in\r\nabsolute value, the apparatus described possesses peculiar properties.\r\nIt constitutes a kind of clock which indicates, registers, and, if\r\nneedful, corrects automatically its own variations of speed. The\r\napparatus being regulated so that the magnetic needle may be at zero,\r\nif the speed of the commutator is slightly increased, the equilibrium\r\nis disturbed and the magnetic needle deviates in the corresponding\r\ndirection; if on the contrary the speed diminishes, the action of the\r\nantagonistic circuit predominates, and the needle deviates in the\r\ncontrary direction. These deviations, when small, are proportional to\r\nthe variations of speed. They may be, in the first place, observed.\r\nThey may, further, be registered, either photographically or by\r\nemploying a Redier apparatus, like that which M. Mascart has adapted\r\nto his quadrant electrometer; finally, we may arrange the Redier to\r\nreact upon the speed so as to reduce its variations to zero. If these\r\nvariations are not completely annulled, they will still be registered\r\nand can be taken into account.\r\n\r\nAs an indicator of variations this apparatus can be of remarkable\r\nsensitiveness, which may be increased indefinitely by enlarging its\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nWith a battery of 10 volts, a condenser of a microfarad, 10 discharges\r\nper second, and a Thomson's differential galvanometer sensitive to\r\n10^{-10} amperes, we obtain already a sensitiveness of 1/1000000,\r\ni.e., a variation of 1/1000000 in the speed is shown after some\r\nseconds of a deviation of one millimeter. Even the stroboscopic method\r\ndoes not admit of such sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore find, with a very close approximation, a speed always\r\nthe same on condition that the solid parts of the apparatus (the\r\ncondenser and the resistance) are protected from causes of variation\r\nand used always at the same temperature. Doubtless, a well-constructed\r\nastronomical clock maintains a very uniform movement; but the electric\r\nclock is placed in better conditions for invariability, for all the\r\nparts are massive and immovable; they are merely required to remain\r\nunchanged, and there is no question of the wear and tear of\r\nwheel-work, the oxidation of oils, or the variations of weight. In\r\nother words, the system formed by a condenser and a resistance\r\nconstitutes a standard of time easy of preservation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW METHOD OF MAINTAINING THE VIBRATION OF A PENDULUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent number of the _Comptes Rendus_ contains a note by M.J.\r\nCarpentier describing a method of maintaining the vibrations of a\r\npendulum by means of electricity, which differs from previous devices\r\nof the same character in that the impulse given to the pendulum at\r\neach vibration is independent of the strength of the current employed,\r\nand that the pendulum itself is entirely free, save at the point of\r\nsuspension. The vibrations are maintained, not by direct impulsion,\r\nbut by a slight horizontal displacement of the point of suspension in\r\nalternate directions.\r\n\r\nThis, as M. Carpentier observes, is the method which we naturally\r\nadopt in order to maintain the amplitude of swing of a heavy body\r\nsuspended from a cord held in the hand. The required movement of the\r\npoint of suspension is effected by means of a polarized relay, through\r\nthe coils of which the current is periodically reversed by the action\r\nof the pendulum, in a manner which will presently be explained. The\r\narmature of the relay oscillates between two stops whose distance\r\napart is capable of fine adjustment.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that the impulse is independent of the\r\nstrength of the current in the relay, provided that the armature is\r\nbrought up to the stop on either side. The reversal of the current is\r\neffected by means of a small magnet carried by the bob of the\r\npendulum, and which as it passes underneath the point of suspension is\r\nbrought close to a soft iron armature, which has the form of an arc of\r\na circle described about the point of suspension. This armature is\r\npivoted at its center, and thus executes vibrations synchronously with\r\nthose of the pendulum. These vibrations are adjusted to a very narrow\r\nrange, but are sufficient to close the contacts of a commutator which\r\nreverses the current at each semi-vibration of the pendulum.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and ingenuity of this device will readily be appreciated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. MORELL MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of the great English laryngologist, which has long been\r\nhonored by scientists of England and the Continent, has lately become\r\nfamilar to everyone, even in unprofessional circles, in Germany\r\nbecause of his operations on the Crown Prince's throat. If his wide\r\nexperience and great skill enable him to permanently remove the growth\r\nfrom the throat of his royal patient, if his diagnosis and prognosis\r\nare confirmed, so that no fear need be entertained for the life and\r\nhealth of the Crown Prince, the English specialist will certainly\r\ndeserve the most sincere thanks of the German nation. Every phase of\r\nthis treatment, every new development, is watched with suspense and\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nMany have been unable to suppress the expression of regret that this\r\nimportant case was not under the care of a German, and part of the\r\npress look upon it as unjust treatment of the German specialists. But\r\nscience is international, it knows no political boundaries, and the\r\nchoice of Dr. Mackenzie by the family of the Crown Prince, whose\r\nsympathy with England is natural, cannot be considered a slight to\r\nGerman physicians when it is taken into consideration that the German\r\nauthorities pronounced the growth suspicious and advised a difficult\r\nand doubtful operation, and that Prof. v. Bergman recommended that a\r\nforeign authority be consulted. As Dr. Mackenzie removed the\r\nobstruction, which had already become threatening and, in fact,\r\ndangerous, causing a loss of voice, and promised to remove any new\r\ngrowth from the inside without danger to the patient, the Crown Prince\r\nnaturally trusted him. Since Virchow has made a microscopic examination\r\nof the part which was cut away, and has declared the new growth to be\r\nbenign, all Germans should watch the results of Dr. Mackenzie's\r\noperations with sympathy, trusting that all further growth will be\r\nprevented, and that the Crown Prince will be restored to the German\r\npeople in his former state of health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. MORELL MACKENZIE.]\r\n\r\nDr. Morell Mackenzie has lately reached his fiftieth year, and has\r\nattained the height of his fame as an author and practitioner. He was\r\nborn at Leytonston in 1837, and studied first in London. At the age\r\nof twenty-two he passed his examination, then practiced as physician\r\nin the London Hospital, and obtained his degree in 1862. A year later\r\nhe received the Jackson prize from the Royal Society of Surgeons for\r\nhis treatment of a laryngeal case.\r\n\r\nHe completed his studies in Paris, Vienna (with Siegmund), and\r\nBudapest. In the latter place he worked with Czermak, making a special\r\nstudy of the laryngoscope. Later he published an excellent work on\r\n\"Diseases of the Throat and Nose,\" which was the fruit of twelve\r\nyears' work. The evening before the day on which this work was to have\r\nbeen issued, the whole edition was destroyed by a fire which occurred\r\nin the printing establishment, and had to be reprinted from the proof\r\nsheets, which were saved. In 1870 his work \"On Growths in the Throat\"\r\nappeared, and he has also published many articles in the _British\r\nMedical Journal_, the _Lancet_, _Medical Times and Gazette_, etc.,\r\nwhich have been translated into different languages, making his name\r\nrenowned all over Europe.\r\n\r\nSince he founded the first English hospital for diseases of the throat\r\nand chest, in London in 1863, and held the position of lecturer on\r\ndiseases of the throat in the London Medical College, his career has\r\nbeen watched with interest by the public, and his practice in England\r\nis remarkable. Therefore it is no wonder that his lately published\r\nwork \"On the Hygiene of the Vocal Organs\" has reached its fourth\r\nedition already. This work is read not only by physicians, but also by\r\nsingers and lecturers.\r\n\r\nAs a learned man in his profession, as an experienced diagnostician,\r\nand as a skillful and fortunate practitioner, he is surpassed by none;\r\nand his ability will be well known far beyond the borders of Great\r\nBritain if fortune favors him and he restores the future Emperor of\r\nGermany to his former strength and vigor, without which we cannot\r\nimagine this knightly form. The certainty with which Dr. Mackenzie\r\nspeaks of permanent cures which he has effected in similar cases,\r\ntogether with the clear and satisfactory report of the great\r\npathologist Virchow, lead us to look to the future with\r\nconfidence.--_Illustrirte Zeitung._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPNOTISM IN FRANCE.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Translated for _Science_ from _Der Spinx_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voluntary production of those abnormal conditions of the nerves\r\nwhich to-day are denoted by the term \"hypnotic researches\" has\r\nmanifested itself in all ages and among most of the nations that are\r\nknown to us. Within modern times these phenomena were first reduced to\r\na system by Mesmer, and, on this account, for the future deserve the\r\nattention of the scientific world. The historical description of this\r\ndepartment, if one intends to give a connected account of its\r\ndevelopment, and not a series of isolated facts, must begin with a\r\nnotice of Mesmer's personality, and we must not confound the more\r\nrecent development of our subject with its past history.\r\n\r\nThe period of mesmerism is sufficiently understood from the numerous\r\nwritings on the subject, but it would be a mistake to suppose that in\r\nBraid's \"Exposition of Hypnotism\" the end of this subject had been\r\nreached. In a later work I hope to show that the fundamental ideas of\r\nbiomagnetism have not only had in all periods of this century capable\r\nand enthusiastic advocates, but that even in our day they have been\r\nsubjected to tests by French and English investigators from which they\r\nhave issued triumphant.\r\n\r\nThe second division of this historical development is carried on by\r\nBraid, whose most important service was emphasizing the subjectivity\r\nof the phenomena. Without any connection with him, and yet by\r\nfollowing out almost exactly the same experiments, Professor\r\nHeidenhain reached his physiological explanations. A third division is\r\nbased upon the discovery of the hypnotic condition in animals, and\r\nconnects itself to the _experimentum mirabile_. In 1872 the first\r\nwritings on this subject appear from the pen of the physiologist\r\nCzermak; and since then the investigations have been continued,\r\nparticularly by Professor Preyer.\r\n\r\nWhile England and Germany were led quite independently to the study of\r\nthe same phenomena, France experienced a strange development, which\r\nshows, as nothing else could, how truth everywhere comes to the\r\nsurface, and from small beginnings swells to a flood which carries\r\nirresistibly all opposition with it. This fourth division of the\r\nhistory of hypnotism is the more important, because it forms the\r\nfoundation of a transcendental psychology, and will exert a great\r\ninfluence upon our future culture; and it is this division to which we\r\nwish to turn our attention. We have intentionally limited ourselves to\r\na chronological arrangement, since a systematic account would\r\nnecessarily fall into the study of single phenomena, and would far\r\nexceed the space offered to us.\r\n\r\nJames Braid's writings, although they were discussed in detail in\r\nLittré and Robin's \"Lexicon,\" were not at all the cause of Dr.\r\nPhilips' first books, who therefore came more independently to the\r\nstudy of the same phenomena. Braid's theories became known to him\r\nlater by the observations made upon them in Béraud's \"Elements of\r\nPhysiology\" and in Littré's notes in the translation of Müller's\r\n\"Handbook of Physiology;\" and he then wrote a second brochure, in\r\nwhich he gave in his allegiance to braidism. His principal effort was\r\ndirected to withdrawing the veil of mystery from the occurrences, and\r\nby a natural explanation relegating them to the realm of the known.\r\nThe trance caused by regarding fixedly a gleaming point produces in\r\nthe brain, in his opinion, an accumulation of a peculiar nervous\r\npower, which he calls \"electrodynamism.\" If this is directed in a\r\nskillful manner by the operator upon certain points, it manifests\r\nitself in certain situations and actions that we call hypnotic. Beyond\r\nthis somewhat questionable theory, both books contained a detailed\r\ndescription of some of the most important phenomena; but with the\r\npractical meaning of the phenomena, and especially with their\r\ntherapeutic value, the author concerned himself but slightly. Just on\r\naccount of this pathological side, however, a certain attention has\r\nbeen paid to hypnotism up to the present time.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1847 two surgeons in Poictiers, Drs. Ribaut and Kiaros,\r\nemployed hypnotism with great success in order to make an operation\r\npainless. \"This long and horrible work,\" says a journal of the day,\r\n\"was much more like a demonstration in a dissecting room than an\r\noperation performed upon a living being.\" Although this operation\r\nproduced such an excitement, yet it was twelve years later before\r\ndecisive and positive official intelligence was given of these facts\r\nby Broca, Follin, Velpeau, and Guérinau. But these accounts, as well\r\nas the excellent little book by Dr. Azam, shared the fate of their\r\npredecessors. They were looked upon by students with distrust, and by\r\nthe disciples of Mesmer with scornful contempt.\r\n\r\nThe work of Demarquay and Giraud Teulon showed considerable advance in\r\nthis direction. The authors, indeed, fell back upon the theory of\r\nJames Braid, which they called stillborn, and of which they said,\r\n\"_Elle est restée accrochée en route_;\" but they did not satisfy\r\nthemselves with a simple statement of facts, as did Gigot Suard in his\r\nwork that appeared about the same time. Through systematic experiments\r\nthey tried to find out where the line of hypnotic phenomena intersected\r\nthe line of the realm of the known. They justly recognized that\r\nhypnotism and hysteria have many points of likeness, and in this way\r\nwere the precursors of the present Parisian school. They say that from\r\nmagnetic sleep to the hypnotic condition an iron chain can be easily\r\nformed from the very same organic elements that we find in historical\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, as if to bring an experimental proof of this\r\nassertion, Lasigue published a report on catalepsy in persons of\r\nhysterical tendencies, which be afterward incorporated into his larger\r\nwork. Among his patients, those who were of a quiet and lethargic\r\ntemperament, by simply pressing down the eyelids, were made to enter\r\ninto a peculiar state of languor, in which cataleptic contractions\r\nwere easily produced, and which forcibly recalled hypnotic phenomena.\r\n\"One can scarcely imagine,\" says the author, \"a more remarkable\r\nspectacle than that of a sick person sunk in deep sleep, and\r\ninsensible to all efforts to arouse him, who retains every position in\r\nwhich he is placed, and in it preserves the immobility and rigidity of\r\na statue.\" But this impulse also was in vain, and in only a few cases\r\nwere the practical tests followed up with theoretical explanations.\r\n\r\nUnbounded enthusiasm and unjust blame alike subsided into a silence\r\nthat was not broken for ten years. Then Charles Richet, a renowned\r\nscientist, came forward in 1875, impelled by the duty he felt he owed\r\nas a priest of truth, and made some announcements concerning the\r\nphenomena of somnambulism; and in countless books, all of which are\r\nworthy of attention, he has since then considered the problem from its\r\nvarious sides.\r\n\r\nHe separates somnambulism into three periods. The word here is used\r\nfor this whole class of subjects as Richet himself uses it, viz.,\r\n_torpeur_, _excitation_, and _stupeur_. In the first, which is\r\nproduced by the so-called magnetic passes and the fixing of the eyes,\r\nsilence and languor come over the subject. The second period, usually\r\nproduced by constant repetition of the experiment, is characterized\r\nchiefly by sensibility to hallucination and suggestion. The third\r\nperiod has as its principal characteristics supersensibility of the\r\nmuscles and lack of sensation. Yet let it be noticed that these\r\ndivisions were not expressed in their present clearness until 1880;\r\nwhile in the years between 1872 and 1880, from an entirely different\r\nquarter, a similar hypothesis was made out for hypnotic phenomena.\r\n\r\nJean Martin Charcot, the renowned neurologist of the Parisian\r\nSalpetriere, without exactly desiring it, was led into the study of\r\nartificial somnambulism by his careful experiments in reference to\r\nhysteria, and especially by the question of _metallotherapie_, and in\r\nthe year 1879 had prepared suitable demonstrations, which were given\r\nin public lectures at the Salpetriere. In the following years he\r\ndevoted himself to closer investigation of this subject, and was\r\nhappily and skillfully assisted by Dr. Paul Richer, with whom were\r\nassociated many other physicians, such as Bourneville, Regnard, Fere,\r\nand Binet. The investigations of these men present the peculiarity\r\nthat they observe hypnotism from its clinical and nosographical side,\r\nwhich side had until now been entirely neglected, and that they\r\nobserve patients of the strongest hysterical temperaments. \"If we can\r\nreasonably assert that the hypnotic phenomena which depend upon the\r\ndisturbance of a regular function of the organism demand for their\r\ndevelopment a peculiar temperament, then we shall find the most marked\r\nphenomena when we turn to an hysterical person.\"\r\n\r\nThe inferences of the Parisian school up to this time are somewhat the\r\nfollowing, but their results, belonging almost entirely to the medical\r\nside of the question, can have no place in this discussion. They\r\ndivide the phenomena of hystero-hypnotism, which they also call\r\n_grande hysterie_, into three plainly separable classes, which Charcot\r\ndesignates catalepsy, lethargy, and somnambulism.\r\n\r\nCatalepsy is produced by a sudden sharp noise, or by the sight of a\r\nbrightly gleaming object. It also produces itself in a person who is\r\nin a state of lethargy, and whose eyes are opened. The most striking\r\ncharacteristic of the cataleptic condition is immobility. The subject\r\nretains every position in which he is placed, even if it is an\r\nunnatural one, and is only aroused by the action of suggestion from\r\nthe rigor of a statue to the half life of an automaton. The face is\r\nexpressionless and the eyes wide open. If they are closed, the patient\r\nfalls into a lethargy.\r\n\r\nIn this second condition, behind the tightly closed lids, the pupils\r\nof the eyes are convulsively turned upward. The body is almost\r\nentirely without sensation or power of thought. Especially\r\ncharacteristic of lethargy is the hyper-excitability of the nerves and\r\nmuscles (_hyperexcitabilite neuromusculaire_), which manifests itself\r\nat the slightest touch of any object. For instance, if the extensor\r\nmuscles of the arm are lightly touched, the arm stiffens immediately,\r\nand is only made flexible again by a hard rubbing of the same muscles.\r\nThe nerves also react in a similar manner. The irritation of a nerve\r\ntrunk not only contracts all the small nerves into which it branches,\r\nbut also all those muscles through which it runs.\r\n\r\nFinally, the somnambulistic condition proceeds from catalepsy or from\r\nlethargy by means of a slight pressure upon the _vertex_, and is\r\nparticularly sensitive to every psychical influence. In some subjects\r\nthe eyes are open, in others closed. Here, also, a slight irritation\r\nproduces a certain amount of rigor in the muscle that has been\r\ntouched, but it does not weaken the antagonistic muscle, as in\r\nlethargy, nor does it vanish under the influence of the same\r\nexcitement that has produced it. In order to put an end to the\r\nsomnambulistic condition, one must press softly upon the pupil of the\r\neye, upon which the subject becomes lethargic, and is easily roused by\r\nbreathing upon him. In this early stage, somnambulism appears very\r\ninfrequently.\r\n\r\nCharcot's school also recognize the existence of compound conditions,\r\nthe history of whose symptoms we must not follow here. These slightly\r\nsketched results, as well as a number of other facts, were only\r\nobtained in the course of several years; yet in 1882 the fundamental\r\ninvestigations of this school were considered virtually concluded.\r\nThen Dumont-Pallier, the head of the Parisian Hospital Pitié, came\r\nforward with a number of observations, drawn also exclusively from the\r\nstudy of hystero-hypnotism, and yet differing widely from those\r\nreached by the physicians of the Salpetriere. In a long series of\r\ncommunications, he has given his views, which have in their turn been\r\nviolently attacked, especially by Magnin and Bérillon. I give only the\r\nmost important points.\r\n\r\nAccording to these men, the hyper-excitability of the nerves and\r\nmuscles is present not only in the lethargic condition, but in all\r\nthree periods; and in order to prove this, we need only apply the\r\nsuitable remedy, which must be changed for each period and every\r\nsubject. Slight irritations of the skin prove this most powerfully. A\r\ndrop of warm water or a ray of sunshine produces contractions of a\r\nmuscle whose skin covering they touch.\r\n\r\nDumont-Pallier and Magnin accede to the theory of intermediate stages,\r\nand have tried to lay down rules for them with as great exactness as\r\nCharcot's school. They also are very decided about the three periods,\r\nwhose succession does not appear to them as fixed; but they discovered\r\na new fundamental law which regulates the production as well as the\r\ncessation of the condition--_La cause qui fait, defait_; that is, the\r\nstimulus which produces one of the three periods needs only to be\r\nrepeated in order to do away with that condition. From this the\r\nfollowing diagram of hypnotic conditions is evolved:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd, furthermore, Dumont-Pallier should be considered as the founder\r\nof a series of experiments, for he was the first one to show in a\r\ndecisive manner that the duality of the cerebral system was proved by\r\nthese hypnotic phenomena; and his works, as well as those of Messrs.\r\nBérillon and Descourtis, have brought to light the following facts:\r\nUnder hypnotic conditions, the psychical activity of a brain\r\nhemisphere may be suppressed without nullifying the intellectual\r\nactivity or consciousness. Both hemispheres may be started at the same\r\ntime in different degrees of activity; and also, when the grade is the\r\nsame, they may be independently the seat of psychical manifestations\r\nwhich are in their natures entirely different. In close connection\r\nwith this and with the whole doctrine of hemi-hypnotism, which is\r\nfounded upon these facts, stand the phenomena of thought transference,\r\nwhich we must consider later.\r\n\r\nAs an addition to the investigations of Charcot and Dumont-Pallier,\r\nBrémaud, in 1884, made the discovery that there was a fourth hypnotic\r\nstate, \"fascination,\" which preceded the three others, and manifested\r\nitself by a tendency to muscular contractions, as well as through\r\nsensitiveness to hallucination and suggestion, but at the same time\r\nleft to the subject a full consciousness of his surroundings and\r\nremembrance of what had taken place. Descourtis, in addition,\r\nperceived a similar condition in the transition from hypnotic sleep to\r\nwaking, which he called _delire posthypnotique_, and, instead of using\r\nthe word \"fascination\" to express the opening stage, he substituted\r\n\"captation.\" According to him, the diagram would be the following:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis whole movement, which I have tried to sketch, and whose chief\r\npeculiarity is that it considers hypnotism a nervous malady, and one\r\nthat must be treated clinically and nosographically, was opposed in\r\n1880 in two directions--one source of opposition producing great\r\nresults, while the other fell to the ground. The latter joined itself\r\nto the theory of the mesmerists, and tried, by means of exact\r\nexperiments, to measure the fluid emanating from the human body--an\r\nundertaking which gave slight promise of any satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nBaillif in his thesis (1878) and Chevillard in his (for spiritualists)\r\nvery interesting books, tried, by means of various arguments, to\r\nuphold the fluidic explanation. Despine also thought that by its help\r\nhe had been able to explain the phenomena; but it was Baréty who, in\r\nthe year 1881, first turned general attention in this direction.\r\nAccording to him, mankind possesses a nerve force which emanates from\r\nhim in different kinds of streams. Those coming from the eyes and\r\nfingers produce insensibility to pain, while those generated by the\r\nbreath cause hypnotic conditions. This nerve force goes out into the\r\nether, and there obeys the laws that govern light, being broken into\r\nspectra, etc.\r\n\r\nClaude Perronnet has more lately advanced similar views, and his\r\ngreatest work is now in press. Frederick W.H. Myers and Edmund Gurney\r\nsympathize with these views, and try to unite them with the mesmerist\r\ndoctrine of personal influence and their theory of telepathy. The\r\nthird champion in England of hypnotism, Prof. Hack Tuke, on the\r\ncontrary, sympathizes entirely with the Parisian school, only\r\ndiffering from them in that he has experimented with satisfactory\r\nresults upon healthy subjects. In France this view has lately been\r\naccepted by Dr. Bottey, who recognizes the three hypnotic stages in\r\nhealthy persons, but has observed other phenomena in them, and\r\nvehemently opposes the conception of hypnotism as a malady. His\r\nexcellently written book is particularly commended to those who wish\r\nto experiment in the same manner as the French investigator, without\r\nusing hysterical subjects.\r\n\r\nThe second counter current that opposed itself to the French\r\nneuropathologists, and produced the most lasting impression, is\r\nexpressed by the magic word \"suggestion.\" A generation ago, Dr.\r\nLiebault, the patient investigator and skillful physician, had\r\nendeavored to make a remedial use of suggestion in his clinic at\r\nNancy. Charles Richet and others have since referred to it, but\r\nProfessor Bernheim was the first one to demonstrate its full\r\nsignificance in the realm of hypnotism. According to him,\r\nsuggestion--that is, the influence of any idea, whether received\r\nthrough the senses or in a hypersensible manner (_suggestion\r\nmentale_)--is the key to all hypnotic phenomena. He has not been able\r\nin a single case to verify the bodily phenomena of _grandehypnotisme_\r\nwithout finding suggestion the primary cause, and on this account\r\ndenies the truth of the asserted physical causes. Bernheim says that\r\nwhen the intense expectance of the subject has produced a compliant\r\ncondition, a peculiar capacity is developed to change the idea that\r\nhas been received into an action as well as a great acuteness of\r\nacceptation, which together will produce all those phenomena that we\r\nshould call by the name of \"pathological sleep,\" since they are only\r\nseparable in a gradual way from the ordinary sleep and dream\r\nconditions. Bernheim is particularly strenuous that psychology should\r\nappear in the foreground of hypnotism, and on this point has been\r\nstrongly upheld by men like Professors Beaunis and Richet.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of suggestion in waking conditions, and also a long\r\ntime after the sleep has passed off (_suggestions posthypnotiques ou\r\nsuggestions a (longue) echeance_), as well as the remarkable capacity\r\nof subjects to change their personality (_changement de la\r\npersonnalite objectivation des types_), have been made the subject of\r\ncareful investigation. The voluntary production of bleeding and\r\nstigmata through spiritual influence has been asserted, particularly\r\nby Messrs. Tocachon, Bourru, and Burot. The judicial significance of\r\nsuggestion has been discussed by Professor Liegeois and Dr. Ladame.\r\nProfessor Pitres in Bordeaux is one of the suggestionists, though\r\ndiffering in many points from the Nancy school.\r\n\r\nThis whole tendency brings into prominence the psychical influence,\r\nwhile it denies the production of these results from purely physical\r\nphenomena, endeavoring to explain them in a different manner. These\r\nexplanations carry us into two realms, the first of which has been\r\nlately opened, and at present seems to abound more in enigmas than in\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\n_Metallotherapie_, which was called into existence by Dr. Burg, and\r\nfurther extended by Dr. Gellé, contains a special point of\r\ninterest--the so-called transference in the case of hysterically or\r\nhypnotically affected persons. Transference is caused by\r\nelectro-magnetism, which has this peculiarity--that in the case of\r\nspecially sensitive persons it can transfer the bodily affection from\r\nleft to right, and _vice versa_. The transference of paralysis, the\r\ncures attempted on this plan, and the so-called \"psychical\r\ntransference,\" which contains special interest for graphologists, are\r\nat the present time still open questions, as well as the closely\r\nconnected theory of human polarity; and the odic experiments of Dr.\r\nChazarain are yet waiting for their confirmation. At present the\r\nproblem of the connection between magnetism and hypnotism is under\r\ninvestigation, and in such a manner that we may hope for a speedy\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nStill stranger than these reports are the accounts of the distant\r\noperation of certain bodies; at least, they seem strange to those\r\nunacquainted with psychometry and the literature of the past century\r\nrelating to this subject. Two physicians in Rochefort, Professors\r\nBourru and Burot, in treating a hystero-epileptic person, found that\r\ngold, even when at a distance of fifteen centimeters, produced in him\r\na feeling of unbearable heat. They continued these experiments with\r\ngreat care, and, after a number of trials, came to this\r\nconclusion--that in some persons certain substances, even when\r\ncarefully separated from them by long distance, exercise exactly the\r\nsame physiological influence as if introduced into their organism. In\r\norder to explain these phenomena, they refer to the radiating force of\r\nBaréty, an explanation neither satisfactory to themselves nor to\r\nothers. Lately the distinguished Parisian physician, Dr. Luys, has\r\nconfirmed by his experiments the existence of these phenomena, but he\r\nthinks the explanation referable to hyper-sensitiveness of the\r\n\"_regions emotives et intellectuelles de l'encephale_\" yet even he has\r\nnot reached the kernel of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn close connection with action at a distance is the question of\r\ndistant production of hypnotic sleep. For an answer to this problem,\r\nthey are experimenting in both France and England; and Frederick W.H.\r\nMyers has thrown an entirely new light upon the subject by the\r\ninvestigations he is making upon a purely experimental basis. In Italy\r\nthey have limited themselves to the study of isolated cases of\r\nhystero-hypnotism, except as the phenomena of magnetic fascination\r\ninvestigated by Donato have given rise to further research; but all\r\nthe books I have seen upon this subject, as well as many by French\r\nauthors, suffer from ignorance of the latest English discoveries.\r\n\r\nWith this I think that I have given a slight outline of the history of\r\nhypnotic investigation to the end of the year 1886. I shall attempt a\r\ncriticism of this whole movement at some other time, as space is not\r\nafforded to me here; but I should like to make this statement now,\r\nthat two of the characteristic indications of this period are of the\r\ngravest import--first the method (\"Our work,\" says Richet, \"is that of\r\nstrictly scientific _testing_, _observation_, and _arrangement_\");\r\nand, secondly, the result. Hypnotism has been received into the realm\r\nof scientific investigation, and with this the foundation of a true\r\nexperimental psychology has been laid.\r\n\r\nMAX DESSOIR.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUODENUM: A SIPHON TRAP.\r\n\r\nBy MAYO COLLIER, M.S. Lond., F.R.C.S. Eng.; Senior\r\nAssistant Surgeon, North-West London Hospital; Assistant Demonstrator\r\nof Anatomy, London Hospital Medical College.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may take it for granted that all gases generated in the jejunum,\r\nileum, and large intestines pass onward toward the anus, and there\r\nsooner or later escape. Fetid gases--except those generated in the\r\nstomach and duodenum--never pass upward, not even during vomiting due\r\nto hernia, obstruction, and other causes. Physiologists, it would\r\nappear, have never busied themselves to find an explanation for this\r\napparent breach of the laws of gravity. The intestinal canal is a tube\r\nwith various dilatations and constrictions, but at no spot except the\r\npylorus does the constriction completely obliterate the lumen of the\r\ntube, and here only periodically. It is perfectly evident, then, that,\r\nunless some system of trap exists in the canal, gases are free to\r\ntravel from below upward in obedience to the laws of gravity, and\r\nwould, as a matter of fact, sooner or later do so. From the straight,\r\ncourse and vertical position of the oesophagus, a very slight\r\npressure of gas in the stomach easily overcomes the closure of its\r\ncardiac sphincter and allows of escape. When the stomach has digested\r\nits contents and the pylorus is relaxed, gases generated in the\r\nduodenum can and do ascend into the stomach and so escape. Normally,\r\nno fetid gases are generated in the stomach or duodenum. If we follow\r\nthe course of the intestines down, we find that the duodenum presents\r\na remarkable curve.\r\n\r\nNow, there are some points of great interest in connection with this\r\nremarkable, almost circular, curve of the duodenum. In the first\r\nplace, this curve is a constant feature in all mammalians. Mr. Treves\r\nsays it is one of the most constant features in the anatomy of the\r\nintestines in man, and, speaking of mammalians in general, that the\r\ncurve of the duodenum varies in shape, but is never absent, becoming\r\nmore complex in some of the higher primates, but seldom less distinct\r\nthan in man. In birds the duodenum always forms a long loop embracing\r\nthe pancreas.\r\n\r\nA second point of great interest is the absolute constancy and\r\nfixation of its terminal portion at the point of junction with the\r\njejunum, more correctly termed second ascending or fourth portion. Mr.\r\nTreves says that this fourth portion is never less than an inch, and\r\nis practically constant. It extends along the side of the left crus of\r\nthe diaphragm opposite the second lumbar vertebra, and is there firmly\r\nfixed to the front of the aorta and crus of the diaphragm by a strong\r\nfibro-muscular band, slinging it up and absolutely retaining it in\r\nposition. This band has been termed the \"musculus suspensorius\r\nduodeni,\" but is chiefly composed of white fibrous tissue, and is more\r\nof the native of a ligament than a muscle. This ligament is always\r\npresent, and its position is never altered. The curve of the duodenum\r\nmay descend as far as the iliac fossa, but the terminal portion is\r\nalways maintained by this band in its normal position.\r\n\r\nAnother point of great constancy is the position of the pancreas and\r\nits relation to the curve of the duodenum. The duodenum always curves\r\nround the head of the pancreas and is, as it were, moulded on it and\r\nretained in position by it. In birds the duodenum always forms a long\r\nloop embracing the pancreas. Further, the ducts of the liver and\r\npancreas always open into the center Of the duodenum, either\r\nseparately or by a common opening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow, the absolute constancy of the curve of the duodenum, the complete\r\nfixation of its fourth portion, the position of the pancreas, and the\r\nplace of entry of the ducts of the pancreas and liver, are all\r\ncomponent parts of a siphon trap, whereby gases generated below the\r\nduodenum are prevented from passing upward. A reference to the\r\naccompanying diagrams will make this quite clear. A is a diagram of a\r\nsiphon trap copied from Parkes' hygiene. B is a very diagrammatic\r\noutline of the stomach and duodenum, _a_ is intended to mark the\r\nposition of the fibrous band, or musculus suspensorius duodeni; and\r\n_b_ the position of entry of the ducts of the liver and pancreas. The\r\nduodenum, then, is a siphon trap, and a most efficient one. Now, the\r\nefficiency of a siphon trap depends not only on its shape, but what is\r\nabsolutely essential is that the curve must be kept constantly full of\r\nfluid, without which it ceases to be a trap, and would allow gases to\r\nascend freely. The position of the place of entry of the ducts of the\r\npancreas and liver assures that this _sine qua non_ shall be present.\r\nThe discharge of the secretions of the pancreas and liver, although\r\nmore active during and after feeding, is practically constant, and so\r\ninsures in an admirable manner that the curve on which the efficiency\r\nof the trap depends shall be constantly kept full not only with fluid,\r\nbut, as I would suggest, antiseptic fluid. There is no other trap in\r\nthe intestinal canal, but the peculiar position of the colon would no\r\ndoubt have more or less effect in preventing gases ascending through\r\nthe ileo-cæcal valve.--_Lancet._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN CRANBERRY CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many thousands of well informed persons with whom the\r\ncranberry is a staple article of food throughout the autumn and\r\nwinter, and who especially derive from its pungent flavor sharp relish\r\nfor their Thanksgiving and Christmas turkey, not one in ten has any\r\ndefinite idea as to where the delicious fruit comes from, or of the\r\nmethod of growing and harvesting it. Most people are, however, aware\r\nthat it is raised on little \"truck patches\" somewhere down in New\r\nJersey or about Cape Cod, and some have heard that it is gleaned from\r\nthe swamps in the Far West by Indians and shipped to market by white\r\ntraders. But to the great majority its real history is unknown.\r\n\r\nYet the cranberry culture is an industry in which millions of dollars\r\nare invested in this country, and it gives employment, for at least a\r\nportion of each year, to many thousands of people. In the East, where\r\nthe value of an acre of even swamp land may run up into the thousands\r\nof dollars, a cranberry marsh of five or ten acres is considered a\r\nlarge one, and, cultivated in the careful, frugal style in vogue\r\nthere, may yield its owner a handsome yearly income. But in the great,\r\nboundless West, where land, and more especially swamp land, may be had\r\nfor from $1 to $5 an acre, we do these things differently, if not\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe State of Wisconsin produces nearly one-half of the cranberries\r\nannually grown in the United States. There are marshes there covering\r\nthousands of acres, whereon this fruit grows wild, having done so even\r\nas far back as the oldest tradition of the native red man extends. In\r\nmany cases the land on which the berries grow has been bought from the\r\ngovernment by individuals or firms, in vast tracts, and the growth of\r\nthe fruit promoted and encouraged by a system of dikes and dams\r\nwhereby the effects of droughts, frost, and heavy rainfalls are\r\ncounteracted to almost any extent desired. Some of these holdings\r\naggregate many thousands of acres under a single ownership; and after\r\na marsh of this vast extent has been thoroughly ditched and good\r\nbuildings, water works, etc., are erected on it, its value may reach\r\nmany thousands of dollars, while the original cost of the land may\r\nhave been merely nominal.\r\n\r\nLarge portions of Jackson, Wood, Monroe, Marinette, Juneau, and Green\r\ncounties are natural cranberry marshes. The Wisconsin Valley division\r\nof the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway runs through a closely\r\ncontinuous marsh, forty miles long and nearly as wide, as level as a\r\nfloor, which is an almost unbroken series of cranberry farms. The\r\nIndians, who inhabited this country before the white man came, used to\r\ncongregate here every fall, many of them traveling several hundred\r\nmiles, to lay in their winter supply of berries. Many thousands of\r\nbarrels are now annually shipped from this region; and thus this vast\r\narea, which to the stranger looking upon it would appear utterly\r\nworthless, is as valuable as the richest farming lands in the State.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances, however, this fruit is cultivated in Wisconsin in\r\na style similar to that practiced in the East; that is, by paring the\r\nnatural sod from the bog, covering the earth to a depth of two or\r\nthree inches with sand, and then transplanting the vines into soil\r\nthus prepared. The weeds are then kept down for a year or two, when\r\nthe vines take full possession of the soil, and further attention is\r\nunnecessary. The natural \"stand\" of the vines in the sod is so\r\nproductive, however, and the extent of country over which bountiful\r\nnature has distributed them so vast, that few operators have thought\r\nit necessary to incur the expense of special culture.\r\n\r\nOne of the best and most perfectly equipped marshes in Wisconsin is\r\nowned by Mr. G.B. Sackett, of Berlin. It is situated four miles north\r\nof that village, and comprises 1,600 acres, nearly all of which is a\r\nveritable bog, and is covered with a natural and luxuriant growth of\r\ncranberry vines. A canal has been cut from the Fox River to the\r\nsouthern limit of the marsh, a distance of 4,400 ft. It is 45 ft.\r\nwide, and the water stands in it to a depth of nine feet, sufficient\r\nto float fair sized steamboats. At the intersection of the canal with\r\nthe marsh steam water works have been erected, with flood gates and\r\ndams by means of which the entire marsh may be flooded to a depth of a\r\nfoot or more when desired. There are two engines of 150 horse power\r\neach, and two pumps that are capable of raising 80,000 gallons per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nWhen, in early autumn, the meteorological conditions indicate the\r\napproach of frost, the pumps may he put to work in the afternoon and\r\nthe berries be effectually covered by water and thus protected before\r\nnightfall. At sunrise the gates are opened and the water allowed to\r\nrun off again, so that the pickers may proceed with their work. The\r\nmarsh is flooded to a depth of about two feet at the beginning of each\r\nwinter and allowed to remain so until spring, the heavy body of ice\r\nthat forms preventing the upheaval that would result from freezing and\r\nthawing--a natural process which, if permitted, works injury to the\r\nvines.\r\n\r\nThere is a three-story warehouse on the marsh, with a capacity of\r\n20,000 barrels of berries, and four large two-story houses capable of\r\nfurnishing shelter for 1,500 pickers. The superintendent's residence\r\nis a comfortable cottage house, surrounded by giant oaks and elms, and\r\nstands near the warehouse on an \"island,\" or small tract of high, dry\r\nland near the center of the great marsh. The pickers' quarters stand\r\non another island about 200 yards away.\r\n\r\nA plank roadway, built on piles, about two feet above the level of the\r\nground, leads from the mainland to the warehouse and other buildings,\r\na distance of more than half a mile. Several wooden railways diverge\r\nfrom the warehouse to all parts of the marsh, and on them flat cars,\r\npropelled by hand, are sent out at intervals during the picking season\r\nto bring in the berries from the hands of the pickers. Each picker is\r\nprovided with a crate, holding just a bushel, which is kept close at\r\nhand. The berries are first picked into tin pans and pails, and from\r\nthese emptied into the crates, in which they are carried to the\r\nwarehouse, where an empty crate is given the picker in exchange for a\r\nfull one. Thus equipped and improved, the Sackett marsh is valued at\r\n$150,000. Thirteen thousand barrels have been harvested from this\r\ngreat farm in a single season. The selling price in the Chicago market\r\nvaries, in different seasons, from $8 to $16 per barrel. There are\r\nseveral other marshes of various sizes in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe picking season usually begins about Sept. 1, and from that time\r\nuntil Oct. 1 the marshes swarm with men, women, and children, ranging\r\nin age from six to eight years, made up from almost every nationality\r\nunder the sun. Bohemians and Poles furnish the majority of the working\r\nforce, while Germans, Irish, Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, negroes,\r\nIndians, and Americans contribute to the motley contingent. They come\r\nfrom every direction and from various distances, some of them\r\ntraveling a hundred miles or more to secure a few days' or weeks'\r\nwork. Almost every farmer or woodsman living anywhere in the region of\r\nthe marshes turns out with his entire family; and the families of all\r\nthe laboring men and mechanics of the surrounding towns and cities\r\njoin in the general hegira to the bogs, and help to harvest the fruit.\r\nThose living within a few miles go out in the morning and return home\r\nat night, taking their noon-day meal with them, while those from a\r\ndistance take provisions and bedding with them and camp in the\r\nbuildings provided for that purpose by the marsh owners, doing their\r\nown cooking on the stoves and with the fuel furnished them.\r\n\r\nThe wages vary from fifty cents to a dollar a bushel, owing to the\r\nabundance or scarcity of the fruit. A good picker will gather from\r\nthree to four bushels a day where the yield is light, and five to six\r\nbushels where it is good. The most money is made by families numbering\r\nfrom half a dozen to a dozen members. Every chick and child in such\r\nfamilies over six years old is required to turn out and help swell the\r\nrevenue of the little household, and the frugal father often pockets\r\nten to twenty dollars a day as the fruits of the combined labors. The\r\npickers wade into the grass, weeds, and vines, however wet with dew or\r\nrain, or however deeply flooded underneath, making not the slightest\r\neffort to keep even their feet dry, and after an hour's work in the\r\nmorning are almost as wet as if they had swum a river. Many of them\r\nwade in barefooted, others wearing low cowhide shoes, and their feet,\r\nat least, are necessarily wet all day long. In many cases their bodies\r\nare thinly clad, and they must inevitably suffer in frosty mornings\r\nand evenings and on the raw, cold, rainy days that are frequent in the\r\nautumn months in this latitude; yet they go about their work singing,\r\nshouting, and jabbering as merrily as a party of comfortably clad\r\nschool children at play. How any of them avoid colds, rheumatism, and\r\na dozen other diseases is a mystery; and yet it is rarely that one of\r\nthem is ill from the effects of this exposure. As many as 3000 or 4000\r\npickers are sometimes employed on a single marsh when there is a heavy\r\ncrop, and an army of such ragamuffins as get together for this\r\npurpose, scattered over a bog in confusion and disorder, presents a\r\nstrange and picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nIndians are not usually as good pickers as white people, but in the\r\nsparsely settled districts, where many of the berry farms are\r\nsituated, it is impossible to get white help enough to take care of\r\nthe crop in the short time available for the work, and owners are\r\ncompelled to employ the aborigines. A rake, with the prongs shaped\r\nlike the letter V, is used for picking in some cases, but owing to the\r\nlarge amount of grass and weeds that grow among the vines on these\r\nwild marshes, this instrument is rarely available. After being picked\r\nthe berries are stored in warehouses for a period varying from one to\r\nthree weeks. They are washed and dried by being passed through a\r\nfanning mill made for the purpose, and are then allowed to cure and\r\nripen thoroughly before they are shipped to market.\r\n\r\nFrom statistics gathered by the American Cranberry Growers'\r\nAssociation it is learned that in 1883 Wisconsin produced 135,507\r\nbushels, in 1884 24,738 bushels, in 1885 264,432 bushels, and in 1886\r\n70,686 bushels of this fruit. By these figures it will be seen that\r\nthe yield is very irregular. This is owing, principally, to the fact\r\nthat many of the marshes are not yet provided with the means of\r\nflooding, and of course suffer from worms, droughts, late spring or\r\nearly autumn frosts, and extensive fires started by sparks from the\r\nengines on railroads running through the marshes. These and various\r\nother evils are averted on the more improved farms. So that, while\r\nhandsome fortunes have in many cases been made in cranberry growing,\r\nmany thousands of dollars have, on the other hand, been sunk in the\r\nsame industry. Only the wealthier owners, who have expended vast sums\r\nof money in improving and equipping their property, can calculate with\r\nany degree of certainty on a paying crop of fruit every year.\r\n\r\nChicago is the great distributing point for the berries produced in\r\nWisconsin, shipments being made thence to nearly every State and\r\nTerritory in the Union, to Canada, to Mexico, and to several European\r\ncountries. Berries sent to the Southern markets are put up in\r\nwatertight packages, and the casks are then filled with water, this\r\nbeing the only means by which they can be kept in hot weather. Even in\r\nthis condition they can only be kept a few days after reaching hot\r\nclimates.--_American Magazine._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUDAN COFFEE.\r\n\r\n(_Parkia biglobosa._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are valuable plants on every continent. Civilized Europe no\r\nlonger counts them. Mysterious Africa is no less largely and\r\nspontaneously favored with them than young America and the ancient\r\nterritory of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe latter has given us the majority of the best fruits of our\r\ngardens. We have already shown how useful the butter tree\r\n(_Butyrospermum Parkii_) is in tropical Africa, and we also know how\r\nthe _gourou_ (_Sterculia acuminata_) is cultivated in the same\r\nregions. But that is not all, for the great family of Leguminosæ,\r\nwhose numerous representatives encumber this continent, likewise\r\nfurnishes the negro natives a food that is nearly as indispensable to\r\nthem as the _gourou_ or the products of the baobab--another valuable\r\ntree and certainly the most widely distributed one in torrid Africa.\r\nThis leguminous tree, which is as yet but little known in the\r\ncivilized world, has been named scientifically _Parkia biglobosa_ by\r\nBentham. The negroes give it various names, according to the tribe;\r\namong the Ouloffs, it is the _houlle_; among the Mandigues, _naytay_;\r\nin Cazamance (Nalon language), it is _nayray_; in Bornou, _rounuo_; in\r\nHaoussa, _doroa_; in Hant-fleure (Senegal), _nayraytou_. On the old\r\nmysterious continent it plays the same role that the algarobas do in\r\nyoung America. However, it is quite a common rule to find in the order\r\nLeguminosæ, and especially in the section Mimosæ, plants whose pods\r\nare edible. Examples of this fact are numerous. As regards the\r\nMediterranean region, it suffices to cite the classic carob tree\r\n(_Ceratonia siliqua_), which also is of African nationality, but which\r\nis wanting in the warm region of this continent.\r\n\r\nThroughout the tropical region of Africa, the aborigines love to\r\nconsume the saccharine pulp and the seed contained in the pod of the\r\n_houlle_. Prepared in different ways, according to tribe and latitude,\r\nthese two products constitute a valuable aliment. The pulp is consumed\r\neither just as it is or as a fermented beverage. As for the seeds,\r\nthey serve, raw or roasted, for the production of a tea-like infusion\r\n(whence the name \"Soudan coffee\"), or, after fermentation in water,\r\nfor making a national condiment, which in certain places is called\r\n_kinda_, and which is mixed with boiled rice or prepared meats. This\r\npreparation has in most cases a pasty form or the consistency of\r\ncohesive flour; but in order to render its carriage easier in certain\r\nof the African centers where the trade in it is brisk, it is\r\ncompressed into tablets similar to those of our chocolate. As these\r\ntwo products are very little known in Europe, it has seemed to us that\r\nit would be of interest to give a description and chemical analysis of\r\nthem. We shall say but little of the plant, which has sufficiently\r\noccupied botanists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 1 TO 6.--PODS OF THE HOULLE AND MICROSCOPIC\r\nDETAILS.]\r\n\r\nThe houlle (_Parkia biglobosa_) is a large tree from 35 to 50 feet in\r\nheight, with a gray bark, many branches, and large, elegant leaves.\r\nThe latter are compound, bipinnate (Fig. 7), and have fifty pairs of\r\nleaflets, which are linear and obtuse and of a grayish green. The\r\ninflorescence is very pleasing to the eye. The flowers, say the\r\nauthors of the _Floræ Senegambiæ Tentamen_, form balls of a dazzling\r\nred, contracted at the base, and resembling the pompons of our\r\ngrenadiers (Fig. 8). The support of this latter consists only of male\r\nflowers. The fruit that succeeds these flowers is supported by a\r\nclub-shaped receptacle. It consists of a large pod, which at maturity\r\nis 13 inches in length by 10 in width (Fig. 1). This pod is chocolate\r\nbrown, quite smooth or slightly tubercular, and is swollen at the\r\npoints where the seeds are situated. The pods are straight or slightly\r\ncurved. The aborigines of Rio Nunez use the pods for poisoning the\r\nfishes that abound in the watercourses. We do not know what the nature\r\nof the toxic principle is that is contained in these hard pods, but we\r\nwell know the nature of the yellowish pulp and of the seeds that\r\nentirely fill the pods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--PARKIA BIGLOBOSA.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the pulp forms a continuous whole, each seed easily separates\r\nfrom the following and carries with it a part of the pulp that\r\nsurrounds it and that constitutes an independent mass (Fig. 2). This\r\npulpy substance, formed entirely of oval cells filled with aleurone,\r\nconsists of two distinct layers. The first, an external one of a\r\nbeautiful yellow, is from 10 to 15 times bulkier than the internal\r\none, which likewise is of a beautiful yellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8--FLOWERS OF PARKIA.]\r\n\r\nIt detaches itself easily from the seed, while the internal layer,\r\nwhich adheres firmly to the exterior of the seed, can be detached only\r\nby maceration in water. This fresh pulp has a sweet and agreeable\r\nalthough slightly insipid taste. Upon growing old and becoming dry, it\r\ntakes on a still more agreeable taste, for it preserves its sweetness\r\nand gets a perfume like that of the violet.\r\n\r\nAs for the seed, which is of a brown color and provided with a hard,\r\nshining skin, that is 0.4 inch long, 0.3 inch wide, and 0.2 inch\r\nthick. It is oval in form, with quite a prominent beak at the hilum\r\n(Fig. 4). The margin is blunt and the two convex sides are provided in\r\nthe center with a gibbosity limited by a line parallel with the\r\nmargin, and this has given the plant its specific name of _biglobosa_.\r\nThe mean weight of each seed is 4½ grains. The skin, though thick, is\r\nnot very strong. It consists, anatomically, of four layers (Fig. 5) of\r\na thick cuticle, _c_; of a zone of palissade cells, _z p_; of a zone\r\nof cells with thick tangential walls arranged in a single row; and of\r\na zone tougher than the others, formed of numerous cells with thick\r\nwalls, without definite form, and filled with a blackish red coloring\r\nmatter, _cs_. This perisperm covers an exalbuminous embryo formed\r\nalmost entirely of two thick, greenish yellow cotyledons having a\r\nstrong taste of legumine.\r\n\r\nWhen examined under the microscope, these cotyledons, the alimentary\r\npart of the seed, have the appearance represented in Fig. 6, where\r\n_ep_ is the epidermic layer and _cp_ constitutes the uniform\r\nparenchyma of the cotyledonary leaf. This parenchymatous mass consists\r\nof oval cells filled with fatty matter and granules of aleurone.\r\n\r\nAccording to some chemical researches made by Professor\r\nSchlagdenhauffen, the pulp has the following composition per 100\r\nparts:\r\n\r\n    Fatty matter                     2.407\r\n    Glucose                         33.92\r\n    Inverted sugar                   7.825\r\n    Coloring matter and free acids   1.300\r\n    Albuminous matter                5.240\r\n    Gummy matter                    19.109\r\n    Cellulose                        8.921\r\n    Lignose                         17.195\r\n    Salts                            4.080\r\n                                   -------\r\n    Total                          100.000\r\n\r\nThe salient point of these analytical results is the enormous quantity\r\nof matter (nearly 60 per cent.) formed almost exclusively by sugar. It\r\nis not surprising, from this that this product constitutes a food both\r\nagreeable and useful.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the entire seed, made by the same chemist, has given\r\nthe following results:\r\n\r\n    Solid fatty matter                     21.145\r\n    Unreduced sugar                         6.183\r\n    Undetermined matters                    5.510\r\n    Gummy          \"                       10.272\r\n    Albuminoid     \"                       24.626\r\n    Cellulosic     \"                        5.752\r\n    Lignose and losses                     20.978\r\n    Salts                                   5.534\r\n                                          -------\r\n    Total                                 100.000\r\n\r\nThe presence in these seeds of a large quantity of fatty matters and\r\nsugar, and especially of albuminoid matters (very nutritive), largely\r\njustifies the use made of them as a food. The innate instinct of the\r\nsavage peoples of Africa has thus anticipated the data of\r\nscience.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEIGHT OF SUMMER CLOUDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the heights and movements of the clouds is of much\r\ninterest to science, and of especial importance in the prediction of\r\nweather. The subject has therefore received much attention during\r\nrecent years from meteorologists, chiefly in this country and in\r\nSweden. In the last published report of the Meteorological Council for\r\n1885-86 will be found an account of the steps taken by that body to\r\nobtain cloud photographs; and in the _Meteorologische Zeitschrift_ for\r\nMarch last, M.M. Ekholm and Hagstrom have published an interesting\r\nsummary of the results of observations made at Upsala during the\r\nsummers of 1884-85. They determined the parallax of the clouds by\r\nangular measurements made from two stations at the extremities of a\r\nbase of convenient length and having telephonic connection. The\r\ninstruments used were altazimuths, constructed under the direction of\r\nProf. Mohn, specially for measuring the parallax of the aurora\r\nborealis. A full description of these instruments and of the\r\ncalculations will be found in the _Acta Reg Soc. Sc. Ups._, 1884. The\r\nresults now in question are based upon nearly 1,500 measurements of\r\n_heights_; the _motions_ will form the subject of a future paper. It\r\nwas found that clouds are formed at all levels, but that they occur\r\nmost frequently at certain elevations or stages. The following are,\r\napproximately, the mean heights, in feet, of the principal forms:\r\nStratus, 2,000; nimbus, 5,000; cumulus (base) 4,500, (summit) 6,000;\r\ncumulo-stratus (base), 4,600; \"false-cirrus\" (a form which often\r\naccompanies the cumulo-stratus), 12,800; cirro cumulus, 21,000;\r\ncirrus, 29,000 (the highest being 41,000). The maximum of cloud\r\nfrequency was found to be at levels of 2,300 and 5,500 feet.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, all the forms of cloud have a tendency to rise\r\nduring the course of the day; the change, excepting for the cumulus\r\nform, amounting to nearly 6,500 feet. In the morning, when the cirrus\r\nclouds are at their lowest level, the frequency of their lowest\r\nforms--the cirro-cumulus--is greatest; and in the evening, when the\r\nheight of the cirrus is greatest, the frequency of its highest\r\nforms--the cirro-stratus--is also greatest. With regard to the\r\nconnection between the character of the weather and the height of the\r\nclouds, the heights of the bases of the cumulus are nearly constant in\r\nall conditions. The summits, however, are lowest in the vicinity of a\r\nbarometric maximum. They increase in the region of a depression, and\r\nattain their greatest height in thunderstorms, the thickness of the\r\ncumulo stratus stretching sometimes for several miles. The highest\r\nforms of clouds appear to float at their lowest levels in the region\r\nof a depression. The forms of clouds are identical in all parts of the\r\nworld, as has been shown in papers lately read by the Hon. R.\r\nAbercromby before the English and Scottish Meteorological\r\nSocieties.--_Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CAUSE OF IRIDESCENCE IN CLOUDS.\r\n\r\nBy G. JOHNSTONE STONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the sky is occupied by light cirro-cumulus cloud, an optical\r\nphenomenon of the most delicate beauty sometimes presents itself, in\r\nwhich the borders of the clouds and their lighter portions are\r\nsuffused with soft shades of color like those of mother-of-pearl,\r\namong which lovely pinks and greens are the most conspicuous. Usually\r\nthese colors are distributed in irregular patches, just as in\r\nmother-of-pearl; but occasionally they are seen to form round the\r\ndenser patches of cloud a regular colored fringe, in which the several\r\ntints are arranged in stripes following the sinuosities of the outline\r\nof the cloud.\r\n\r\nI cannot find in any of the books an explanation of this beautiful\r\nspectacle, all the more pleasing because it generally presents itself\r\nin delightful summer weather. It is not mentioned in the part of\r\nMoigno's great _Repertoire d'Optique_ which treats of meteorological\r\noptics, nor in any other work which I have consulted. It seems\r\ndesirable, therefore, to make an attempt to search out what appears to\r\nbe its explanation.\r\n\r\nAt the elevation in our atmosphere at which these delicate clouds are\r\nformed the temperature is too low, even in midsummer, for water to\r\nexist in the liquid state; and accordingly, the attenuated vapor from\r\nwhich they were condensed passed at once into a solid form. They\r\nconsist, in fact, of tiny crystals of ice, not of little drops of\r\nwater. If the precipitation has been hasty, the crystals will, though\r\nall small, be of many sizes jumbled together, and in that case the\r\nbeautiful optical phenomenon with which we are now dealing will not\r\noccur. But if the opposite conditions prevail (which they do on rare\r\noccasions), if the vapor had been evenly distributed, and if the\r\nprecipitation took place slowly, then will the crystals in any one\r\nneighborhood be little ice crystals of nearly the same form and size,\r\nand from one neighborhood to another they will differ chiefly in\r\nnumber and size, owing to the process having gone on longer or taken\r\nplace somewhat faster, or through a greater depth, in some\r\nneighborhoods than others. This will give rise to the patched\r\nappearance of the clouds which prevails when this phenomenon presents\r\nitself. It also causes the tiny crystals, of which the cloud consists,\r\nto grow larger in some places than others.\r\n\r\nCaptain Scoresby, in his \"Account of the Arctic Regions,\" gives the\r\nbest description of snow crystals formed at low temperatures with\r\nwhich I am acquainted. From his observations it appears--(a) that\r\nwhen formed at temperatures several degrees below the freezing point,\r\nthe crystals, whether simple or compound, are nearly all of\r\nsymmetrical forms; (b) that thin tabular crystals are extremely\r\nnumerous, consisting either of simple transverse slices of the\r\nfundamental hexagon or, more frequently, of aggregations of these\r\nattached edgewise and lying in one plane; and (c) that, according as\r\natmospheric conditions vary, one form of crystal or another largely\r\npreponderates. A fuller account of these most significant observations\r\nis given in the appendix to this paper.\r\n\r\nLet us then consider the crystals in any one neighborhood in the sky,\r\nwhere the conditions that prevail are such as to produce lamellar\r\ncrystals of nearly the same thickness. The tabular plates are\r\nsubsiding through the atmosphere--in fact, falling toward the earth.\r\nAnd although their descent is very slow, owing to their minute size,\r\nthe resistance of the air will act upon them as it does upon a falling\r\nfeather. It will cause them, if disturbed, to oscillate before they\r\nsettle into that horizontal position which flat plates finally assume\r\nwhen falling through quiescent air. We shall presently consider what\r\nthe conditions must be, in order that the crystals may be liable to be\r\nnow and then disturbed from the horizontal position. If this\r\noccasionally happens, the crystals will keep fluttering, and at any\r\none moment some of them will be turned so as to reflect a ray from the\r\nsun to the eye of the observer from the flat surface of the crystal\r\nwhich is next him. Now, if the conditions are such as to produce\r\ncrystals which are plates with parallel faces, and as they are also\r\ntransparent, part only of the sun's ray that reaches the front face of\r\nthe crystal will be reflected from it; the rest will enter the\r\ncrystal, and, falling on the parallel surface behind, a portion will\r\nbe there reflected, and passing out through the front face, will also\r\nreach the eye of the observer.\r\n\r\nThese two portions of the ray--that reflected from the front face and\r\nthat reflected from the back--are precisely in the condition in which\r\nthey can interfere with one another, so as to produce the splendid\r\ncolors with which we are familiar in soap bubbles. If the crystals are\r\nof diverse thicknesses, the colors from the individual crystals will\r\nbe different, and the mixture of them all will produce merely white\r\nlight; but if all are nearly of the same thickness, they will transmit\r\nthe same color toward the observer, who will accordingly see this\r\ncolor in the part of the cloud occupied by these crystals. The color\r\nwill, of course, not be undiluted; for other crystals will send\r\nforward white light, and this, blended with the colored light, will\r\nproduce delicate shades in cases where the corresponding colors of a\r\nsoap bubble would be vivid.\r\n\r\nWe have now only to explain how it happens that on very rare occasions\r\nthe colors, instead of lying in irregular patches, form definite\r\nfringes round the borders of the cloudlets. The circumstances that\r\ngive rise to this special form of the phenomenon appear to be the\r\nfollowing: While the cloud is in the process of growth (that is, so\r\nlong as the precipitation of vapor into the crystalline state\r\ncontinues to take place), so long will the crystals keep augmenting.\r\nIf, then, a cloudlet is in the process of formation, not only by the\r\nspringing up of fresh crystals around, but also by the continued\r\ngrowth of the crystals within it, then will that patch of cloud\r\nconsist of crystals which are largest in its central part, and\r\ngradually smaller as their situation approaches the outside. Here,\r\nthen, are conditions which will produce one color round the margin of\r\nthe cloud, and that color mixed with others, and so giving rise to\r\nother tints, farther in. In this way there comes into existence that\r\niris-like border which is now and then seen.\r\n\r\nThe occasional upsetting of the crystals, which is required to keep\r\nthem fluttering, may be produced in any of three ways. The cloudlets\r\nmay have been formed from the blending together of two layers of air\r\nsaturated at different temperatures, and moving with different\r\nvelocities or in different directions. Where these currents intermix,\r\na certain amount of disturbance will prevail, which, if sufficiently\r\nslight, would not much interfere with the regularity of the crystals,\r\nand might yet be sufficient to occasion little draughts, which would\r\nblow them about when formed. Or, if the cold layer is above, and if it\r\nis in a sufficient degree colder, there need not be any previous\r\nrelative motion of the two layers; the inevitable convection currents\r\nwill suffice. Another, and probably the most frequent, cause for\r\nlittle breezes in the neighborhood of the cloudlets is that when the\r\ncloudlets are formed they immediately absorb the heat of the sun in a\r\nway that the previously clear air had not done. If they absorb enough,\r\nthey will rise like feeble balloons, and slight return currents will\r\ntravel downward round their margins, throwing all crystals in that\r\nsituation into disorder.\r\n\r\nI do not include among the causes which may agitate the crystals\r\nanother cause which must produce excessively slight currents of air,\r\nnamely, that arising from the subsidence of the cloudlets owing to\r\ntheir weight. The crystals will fall faster wherein cloud masses than\r\nin the intervening portions where the cloud is thinner. But the\r\nsubsidence itself is so slow that any relative motions to which\r\ndifferences in the rate of subsidence can give rise are probably too\r\nfeeble to produce an appreciable effect. Of course, in general, more\r\nthan one of the above causes will concur; and it is the resultant of\r\nthe effects which they would have separately produced that will be\r\nfelt by the crystals.\r\n\r\nIf the precipitation had taken place so very evenly over the sky that\r\nthere were no cloudlets formed, but only one uniform veil of haze,\r\nthen the currents which would flutter the crystals may be so entirely\r\nabsent that the little plates of crystals can fixedly assume the\r\nhorizontal position which is natural to them. In this event the cloud\r\nwill exhibit no iridescence, but, instead of it, a vertical circle\r\nthrough the sun will present itself. This, on some rare occasions, is\r\na feature of the phenomenon of parhelia.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the occasional iridescence of cirrus clouds is\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for by the concurrence of conditions, each of\r\nwhich is known to have a real existence in nature....--_Phil.
