If there be a\r\npeculiar fascination about the earlier chapters of any branch of\r\nhistory, how great must be the interest which attaches to that most\r\nprimeval of all terrestrial histories which relates to the actual\r\nbeginnings of this globe on which we stand.\r\n\r\nIn our efforts to grope into the dim recesses of this awful past, we\r\nwant the aid of some steadfast light which shall illumine the dark\r\nplaces without the treachery of the will-o'-the-wisp. In the absence\r\nof that steadfast light, vague conjectures as to the beginning of\r\nthings could never be entitled to any more respect than was due to\r\nmere matters of speculation.\r\n\r\nOf late, however, the required light has been to some considerable\r\nextent forthcoming, and the attempt has been made, with no little\r\nsuccess, to elucidate a most interesting and wonderful chapter of an\r\nexceedingly remote history. To chronicle this history is the object of\r\nthe present lectures before this Institution.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us be fully aware of the extraordinary remoteness of that\r\nperiod of which our history treats. To attempt to define that period\r\nchronologically would be utterly futile. When we have stated that it\r\nis more ancient than almost any other period which we can discuss, we\r\nhave expressed all that we are really entitled to say. Yet this\r\nconveys not a little. It directs us to look back through all the ages\r\nof modern human history, through the great days of ancient Greece and\r\nRome, back through the times when Egypt and Assyria were names of\r\nrenown, through the days when Nineveh and Babylon were mighty and\r\npopulous cities in the zenith of their glory. Back earlier still to\r\nthose more ancient nations of which we know hardly anything, and\r\nstill earlier to the prehistoric man, of whom we know less; back,\r\nfinally, to the days when man first trod on this planet, untold ages\r\nago. Here is indeed a portentous retrospect from most points of view,\r\nbut it is only the commencement of that which our subject suggests.\r\n\r\nFor man is but the final product of the long anterior ages during\r\nwhich the development of life seems to have undergone an exceedingly\r\ngradual elevation. Our retrospect now takes its way along the vistas\r\nopened up by the geologists. We look through the protracted tertiary\r\nages, when mighty animals, now generally extinct, roamed over the\r\ncontinents. Back still earlier through those wondrous secondary\r\nperiods, where swamps or oceans often covered what is now dry land,\r\nand where mighty reptiles of uncouth forms stalked and crawled and\r\nswam through the old world and the new. Back still earlier through\r\nthose vitally significant ages when the sunbeams were being garnered\r\nand laid aside for man's use in the great forests, which were\r\nafterwards preserved by being transformed into seams of coal. Back\r\nstill earlier through endless thousands of years, when lustrous\r\nfishes abounded in the oceans; back again to those periods\r\ncharacterized by the lower types of life; and still earlier to that\r\nincredibly remote epoch when life itself began to dawn on our\r\nawakening globe. Even here the epoch of our present history can hardly\r\nbe said to have been reached. We have to look through a long\r\nsuccession of ages still antecedent. The geologist, who has hitherto\r\nguided our view, cannot render us much further assistance; but the\r\nphysicist is at hand--he teaches us that the warm globe on which life\r\nis beginning has passed in its previous stages through every phase of\r\nwarmth, of fervour, of glowing heat, of incandescence, and of actual\r\nfusion; and thus at last our retrospect reaches to that particular\r\nperiod of our earth's past history which is specially illustrated by\r\nthe modern doctrine of Time and Tide.\r\n\r\nThe present is the clue to the past. It is the steady application of\r\nthis principle which has led to such epoch-making labours as those by\r\nwhich Lyell disclosed the origin of the earth's crust, Darwin the\r\norigin of species, Max Müller the origin of language. In our present\r\nsubject the course is equally clear. Study exactly what is going on at\r\npresent, and then have the courage to apply consistently and\r\nrigorously what we have learned from the present to the interpretation\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nThus we begin with the ripple of the tide on the sea-beach which we\r\nsee to-day. The ebb and the flow of the tide are the present\r\nmanifestations of an agent which has been constantly at work. Let that\r\npresent teach us what tides must have done in the indefinite past.\r\n\r\nIt has been known from the very earliest times that the moon and the\r\ntides were connected together--connected, I say, for a great advance\r\nhad to be made in human knowledge before it would have been possible\r\nto understand the true relation between the tides and the moon.\r\nIndeed, that relation is so far from being of an obvious character,\r\nthat I think I have read of a race who felt some doubt as to whether\r\nthe moon was the cause of the tides, or the tides the cause of the\r\nmoon. I should, however, say that the moon is not the sole agent\r\nengaged in producing this periodic movement of our waters. The sun\r\nalso arouses a tide, but the solar tide is so small in comparison with\r\nthat produced by the moon, that for our present purpose we may leave\r\nit out of consideration. We must, however, refer to the solar tide at\r\na later period of our discourses, for it will be found to have played\r\na very splendid part at the initial stage of the Earth-Moon History,\r\nwhile in the remote future it will again rise into prominence.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to set forth a few preliminary figures which shall\r\nexplain how it comes to pass that the efficiency of the sun as a\r\ntide-producing agent is so greatly inferior to that of the moon.\r\nIndeed, considering that the sun has a mass so stupendous, that it\r\ncontrols the entire planetary system, how is it that a body so\r\ninsignificant as the moon can raise a bigger tide on the ocean than\r\ncan the sun, of which the mass is 26,000,000 times as great as that of\r\nour satellite?\r\n\r\nThis apparent paradox will disappear when we enunciate the law\r\naccording to which the efficiency of a tide-producing agent is to be\r\nestimated. This law is somewhat different from the familiar form in\r\nwhich the law of gravitation is expressed. The gravitation between two\r\ndistant masses is to be measured by multiplying these masses together,\r\nand dividing the product by the _square_ of the distance. The law for\r\nexpressing the efficiency of a tide-producing agent varies not\r\naccording to the inverse square, but according to the inverse _cube_\r\nof the distance. This difference in the expression of the law will\r\nsuffice to account for the superiority of the moon as a tide-producer\r\nover the sun. The moon's distance on an average is about one 386th\r\npart of that of the sun, and thus it is easy to show that so far as\r\nthe mere attraction of gravitation is concerned, the efficiency of the\r\nsun's force on the earth is about one hundred and seventy-five times\r\nas great as the force with which the moon attracts the earth. That is\r\nof course calculated under the law of the inverse square. To determine\r\nthe tidal efficiency we have to divide this by three hundred and\r\neighty-six, and thus we see that the tidal efficiency of the sun is\r\nless than half that of the moon.\r\n\r\nWhen the solar tide and the lunar tide are acting in unison, they\r\nconspire to produce very high tides and very low tides, or, as we\r\ncall them, spring tides. On the other hand, when the sun is so placed\r\nas to give us a low tide while the moon is producing a high tide, the\r\nnet result that we actually experience is merely the excess of the\r\nlunar tide over the solar tide; these are what we call neap tides. In\r\nfact, by very careful and long-continued observations of the rise and\r\nfall of the tides at a particular port, it becomes possible to\r\ndetermine with accuracy the relative ranges of spring tides and neap\r\ntides; and as the spring tides are produced by moon plus sun, while\r\nthe neap tides are produced by moon minus sun, we obtain a means of\r\nactually weighing the relative masses of the sun and moon. This is one\r\nof the remarkable facts which can be deduced from a prolonged study of\r\nthe tides.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of the law of the tide-producing force is of a\r\nmathematical character, and I do not intend in these lectures to enter\r\ninto mathematical calculations. There is, however, a simple line of\r\nreasoning which, though it falls far short of actual demonstration,\r\nmay yet suffice to give a plausible reason for the law.\r\n\r\nThe tides really owe their origin to the fact that the tide-producing\r\nagent operates more powerfully on those parts of the tide-exhibiting\r\nbody which are near to it, than on the more distant portions of the\r\nsame. The nearer the two bodies are together, the larger\r\nproportionally will be the differences in the distances of its various\r\nparts from the tide-producing body; and on this account the leverage,\r\nso to speak, of the action by which the tides are produced is\r\nincreased. For instance, if the two bodies were brought within half\r\ntheir original distance of each other, the relative size of each body,\r\nas viewed from the other, will be doubled; and what we have called the\r\nleverage of the tide-producing ability will be increased twofold. The\r\ngravitation also between the two bodies is increased fourfold when the\r\ndistance is halved, and consequently, the tide-producing ability is\r\ndoubled for one reason, and increased fourfold again by another;\r\nhence, the tides will be increased eightfold when the distance is\r\nreduced to one half. Now, as eight is the cube of two, this\r\nillustration may be taken as a verification of the law, that the\r\nefficiency of a body as a tide-producer varies inversely as the cube\r\nof the distance between it and the body on which the tides are being\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity we may make the assumption that the whole of the earth\r\nis buried beneath the ocean, and that the moon is placed in the plane\r\nof the equator. We may also entirely neglect for the present the tides\r\nproduced by the sun, and we shall also make the further assumption\r\nthat friction is absent. What friction is capable of doing we shall,\r\nhowever, refer to later on. The moon will act on the ocean and deform\r\nit, so that there will be high tide along one meridian, and high tide\r\nalso on the opposite meridian. This is indeed one of the paradoxes by\r\nwhich students are frequently puzzled when they begin to learn about\r\nthe tides. That the moon should pull the water up in a heap on one\r\nside seems plausible enough. High tide will of course be there; and\r\nthe student might naturally think that the water being drawn in this\r\nway into a heap on one side, there will of course be low tide on the\r\nopposite side of the earth. A natural assumption, perhaps, but\r\nnevertheless a very wrong one. There are at every moment two opposite\r\nparts of the earth in a condition of high water; in fact, this will\r\nbe obvious if we remember that every day, or, to speak a little more\r\naccurately, in every twenty-four hours and fifty one minutes, we have\r\non the average two high tides at each locality. Of course this could\r\nnot be if the moon raised only one heap of high water, because, as the\r\nmoon only appears to revolve around the earth once a day, or, more\r\naccurately, once in that same average period of twenty-four hours and\r\nfifty-one minutes, it would be impossible for us to have high tides\r\nsucceeding each other as they do in periods a little longer than\r\ntwelve hours, if only one heap were carried round the earth.\r\n\r\nThe first question then is, as to how these two opposite heaps of\r\nwater are placed in respect to the position of the moon. The most\r\nobvious explanation would seem to be, that the moon should pull the\r\nwaters up into a heap directly underneath it, and that therefore there\r\nshould be high water underneath the moon. As to the other side, the\r\npresence of a high tide there was, on this theory, to be accounted for\r\nby the fact that the moon pulled the earth away from the waters on the\r\nmore remote side, just as it pulled the waters away from the more\r\nremote earth on the side underneath the moon. It is, however,\r\ncertainly not the case that the high tide is situated in the simple\r\nposition that this law would indicate, and which we have represented\r\nin Fig. 1, where the circular body is the earth, the ocean surrounding\r\nwhich is distorted by the action of the tides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nWe have here taken an oval to represent the shape into which the water\r\nis supposed to be forced or drawn by the tidal action of the\r\ntide-producing body. This may possibly be a correct representation of\r\nwhat would occur on an ideal globe entirely covered with a\r\nfrictionless ocean. But as our earth is not covered entirely by water,\r\nand as the ocean is very far from being frictionless, the ideal tide\r\nis not the tide that we actually know; nor is the ideal tide\r\nrepresented by this oval even an approximation to the actual tides to\r\nwhich our oceans are subject. Indeed, the oval does not represent the\r\nfacts at all, and of this it is only necessary to adduce a single fact\r\nin demonstration. I take the fundamental issue so often debated, as to\r\nwhether in the ocean vibrating with ideal tides the high water or the\r\nlow water should be under the moon. Or to put the matter otherwise;\r\nwhen we represent the displaced water by an oval, is the long axis of\r\nthe oval to be turned to the moon, as generally supposed, or is it to\r\nbe directed at right angles therefrom? If the ideal tides were in any\r\ndegree representative of the actual tides, so fundamental a question\r\nas this could be at once answered by an appeal to the facts of\r\nobservation. Even if friction in some degree masked the phenomena,\r\nsurely one would think that the state of the actual tides should still\r\nenable us to answer this question.\r\n\r\nBut a study of the tides at different ports fails to realize this\r\nexpectation. At some ports, no doubt, the tide is high when the moon\r\nis on the meridian. In that case, of course, the high water is under\r\nthe moon, as apparently ought to be the case invariably, on a\r\nsuperficial view. But, on the other hand, there are ports where there\r\nis often low water when the moon is crossing the meridian. Yet other\r\nports might be cited in which every intermediate phase could be\r\nobserved. If the theory of the tides was to be the simple one so often\r\ndescribed, then at every port noon should be the hour of high water on\r\nthe day of the new moon or of the full moon, because then both\r\ntide-exciting bodies are on the meridian at the same time. Even if the\r\nfriction retarded the great tidal wave uniformly, the high tide on the\r\ndays of full or change should always occur at fixed hours; but,\r\nunfortunately, there is no such delightful theory of the tides as this\r\nwould imply. At Greenock no doubt there is high water at or about noon\r\non the day of full or change; and if it could be similarly said that\r\non the day of full or change there was high water everywhere at local\r\nnoon, then the equilibrium theory of the tides, as it is called,\r\nwould be beautifully simple. But this is not the case. Even around our\r\nown coasts the discrepancies are such as to utterly discredit the\r\ntheory as offering any practical guide. At Aberdeen the high tide does\r\nnot appear till an hour later than the doctrine would suggest. It is\r\ntwo hours late at London, three at Tynemouth, four at Tralee, five at\r\nSligo, and six at Hull. This last port would be indeed the haven of\r\nrefuge for those who believe that the low tide ought to be under the\r\nmoon. At Hull this is no doubt the case; and if at all other places\r\nthe water behaved as it does at Hull, why then, of course, it would\r\nfollow that the law of low water under the moon was generally true.\r\nBut then this would not tally with the condition of affairs at the\r\nother places I have named; and to complete the cycle I shall add a few\r\nmore. At Bristol the high water does not get up until seven hours\r\nafter the moon has passed the meridian, at Arklow the delay is eight\r\nhours, at Yarmouth it is nine, at the Needles it is ten hours, while\r\nlastly, the moon has nearly got back to the meridian again ere it has\r\nsucceeded in dragging up the tide on which Liverpool's great commerce\r\nso largely depends.\r\n\r\nNor does the result of studying the tides along other coasts beside\r\nour own decide more conclusively on the mooted point. Even ports in\r\nthe vast ocean give a very uncertain response. Kerguelen Island and\r\nSanta Cruz might seem to prove that the high tide occurs under the\r\nmoon, but unfortunately both Fiji and Ascension seem to present us\r\nwith an equally satisfactory demonstration, that beneath the moon is\r\nthe invariable home of low water.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that the study of the tides is in other respects\r\nsuch a confused subject as the facts I have stated would seem to\r\nindicate. It becomes rather puzzling, no doubt, when we compare the\r\ntides at one port with the tides elsewhere. The law and order are,\r\nthen, by no means conspicuous, they are often hardly discernible. But\r\nwhen we confine our attention to the tides at a single port, the\r\nproblem becomes at once a very intelligible one. Indeed, the\r\ninvestigation of the tides is an easy subject, if we are contented\r\nwith a reasonably approximate solution; should, however, it be\r\nnecessary to discuss fully the tides at any port, the theory of the\r\nmethod necessary for doing so is available, and a most interesting and\r\nbeautiful theory it certainly is.\r\n\r\nLet us then speak for a few moments about the methods by which we can\r\nstudy the tides at a particular port. The principle on which it is\r\nbased is a very simple one.\r\n\r\nIt is the month of August, the 18th, we shall suppose, and we are\r\ngoing to enjoy a delicious swim in the sea. We desire, of course, to\r\nsecure a high tide for the purpose of doing so, and we call an almanac\r\nto help us. I refer to the Thom's Dublin Directory, where I find the\r\ntide to be high at 10h. 14m. on the morning of the 18th of August.\r\nThat will then be the time to go down to the baths at Howth or\r\nKingstown.\r\n\r\nBut what I am now going to discourse to you about is not the delights\r\nof sea-bathing, it is rather a different inquiry. I want to ask, How\r\ndid the people who prepared that almanac know years beforehand, that\r\non that particular day the tide would be high at that particular hour?\r\nHow do they predict for every day the hour of high water? and how\r\ncomes it to pass that these predictions are invariably correct?\r\n\r\nWe first refer to that wonderful book, the _Nautical Almanac_. In that\r\nvolume the movements of the moon are set forth with full detail; and\r\namong other particulars we can learn on page iv of every month the\r\nmean time of the moon's meridian passage. It appears that on the day\r\nin question the moon crossed the meridian at 11h. 23m. Thus we see\r\nthere was high water at Dublin at 10h. 14m., and 1h. 9m. later, that\r\nis, at 11h. 23m., the moon crossed the meridian.\r\n\r\nLet us take another instance. There is a high tide at 3.40 P.M. on the\r\n25th August, and again the infallible _Nautical Almanac_ tells us that\r\nthe moon crossed the meridian at 5h. 44m., that is, at 2h. 4m. after\r\nthe high water.\r\n\r\nIn the first case the moon followed the tide in about an hour, and in\r\nthe second case the moon followed in about two hours. Now if we are to\r\nbe satisfied with a very rough tide rule for Dublin, we may say\r\ngenerally that there is always a high tide an hour and a half before\r\nthe moon crosses the meridian. This would not be a very accurate\r\nrule, but I can assure you of this, that if you go by it you will\r\nnever fail of finding a good tide to enable you to enjoy your swim. I\r\ndo not say this rule would enable you to construct a respectable\r\ntide-table. A ship-owner who has to creep up the river, and to whom\r\noften the inches of water are material, will require far more accurate\r\ntables than this simple rule could give. But we enter into rather\r\ncomplicated matters when we attempt to give any really accurate\r\nmethods of computation. On these we shall say a few words presently.\r\nWhat I first want to do, is to impress upon you in a simple way the\r\nfact of the relation between the tide and the moon.\r\n\r\nTo give another illustration, let us see how the tides at London\r\nBridge are related to the moon. On Jan. 1st, 1887, it appeared that\r\nthe tide was high at 6h. 26m. P.M., and that the moon had crossed the\r\nmeridian 56m. previously; on the 8th Jan. the tide was high at 0h.\r\n43m. P.M., and the moon had crossed the meridian 2h. 1m. previously.\r\nTherefore we would have at London Bridge high water following the\r\nmoon's transit in somewhere about an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nI choose a day at random, for example--the 12th April. The moon\r\ncrosses the upper meridian at 3h. 39m. A.M., and the lower meridian at\r\n4h 6m. P.M. Adding an hour and a half to each would give the high\r\ntides at 5h 9m. A.M. and 5h. 36m. P.M.; as a matter of fact, they are\r\n4h. 58m. A.M. and 5h. 20m. P.M.\r\n\r\nBut these illustrations are sufficient. We find that at London, in a\r\ngeneral way, high water appears at London Bridge about an hour and a\r\nhalf after the moon has passed the meridian of London. It so happens\r\nthat the interval at Dublin is about the same, _i.e._ an hour and a\r\nhalf; only that in the latter case the high water precedes the moon by\r\nthat interval instead of following it. We may employ the same simple\r\nprocess at other places. Choose two days about a week distant; find on\r\neach occasion the interval between the transit of the moon and the\r\ntime of high water, then the mean of these two differences will always\r\ngive some notion of the interval between high water and the moon's\r\ntransit. If then we take from the _Nautical Almanac_ the time of the\r\nmoon's transit, and apply to it the correction proper for the port,\r\nwe shall always have a sufficiently good tide-table to guide us in\r\nchoosing a suitable time for taking our swim or our walk by the\r\nsea-side; though if you be the captain of a vessel, you will not be so\r\nimprudent as to enter port without taking counsel of the accurate\r\ntide-tables, for which we are indebted to the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nEvery one who visits the sea-side, or who lives at a sea-port, should\r\nknow this constant for the tides, which affect him and his movements\r\nso materially. If he will discover it from his own experience, so much\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be ascertained is the time of high water. Do not\r\ntake this from any local table; you ought to observe it for yourself.\r\nYou will go to the pier head, or, better still, to some place where\r\nthe rise and fall of the mere waves of the sea will not embarrass you\r\nin your work. You must note by your watch the time when the tide is\r\nhighest. An accurate way of doing this will be to have a scale on\r\nwhich you can measure the height at intervals of five minutes about\r\nthe time of high water. You will then be able to conclude the time at\r\nwhich the tide was actually at its highest point; but even if no\r\ngreat accuracy be obtainable, you can still get much interesting\r\ninformation, for you will without much difficulty be right within ten\r\nminutes or a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nThe correction for the port is properly called the \"establishment,\"\r\nthis being the average time of high water on the days of full and\r\nchange of the moon at the particular port in question.\r\n\r\nWe can considerably amend the elementary notion of the tides which the\r\nformer method has given us, if we adopt the plan described by Dr.\r\nWhewell in the first four editions of the _Admiralty Manual of\r\nScientific Inquiry_. We speak of the interval between the transit of\r\nthe moon and the time of high water as the luni-tidal interval. Of\r\ncourse at full and change this is the same thing as the establishment,\r\nbut for other phases of the moon the establishment must receive a\r\ncorrection before being used as the luni-tidal interval. The\r\ncorrection is given by the following table--\r\n\r\nHour of Moon's transit after Sun:\r\n\r\n0| 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11\r\n-+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n0|-20m|-30m|-50m|-60m|-60m|-60m|-40m|-10m|+10m|+20m|+10m\r\n\r\nCorrection of establishment to find luni-tidal interval:\r\n\r\nThus at a port where the establishment was 3h. 25m., let us suppose\r\nthat the transit of the moon took place at 6 P.M.; then we correct the\r\nestablishment by -60m., and find the luni-tidal interval to be 2h.\r\n25m., and accordingly the high water takes place at 8h. 25m. P.M.\r\n\r\nBut even this method is only an approximation. The study of the tides\r\nis based on accurate observation of their rise and fall on different\r\nplaces round the earth. To show how these observations are to be made,\r\nand how they are to be discussed and reduced when they have been made,\r\nI may refer to the last edition of the _Admiralty Manual of Scientific\r\nInquiry_, 1886. For a complete study of the tides at any port a\r\nself-registering tide-gauge should be erected, on which not alone the\r\nheights and times of high and low water should be depicted, but also\r\nthe continuous curve which shows at any time the height of the water.\r\nIn fact, the whole subject of the practical observation and discussion\r\nand prediction of tides is full of valuable instruction, and may be\r\ncited as one of the most complete examples of the modern scientific\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the tide-gauge itself is a delicate instrument;\r\nit is actuated by a float which rises and falls with the water, due\r\nprovision being made that the mere influence of waves shall not make\r\nit to oscillate inconveniently. The motion of the float when suitably\r\nreduced by mechanism serves to guide a pencil, which, acting on the\r\npaper round a revolving drum, gives a faithful and unintermitting\r\nrecord of the height of the water.\r\n\r\nThus what the tide-gauge does is to present to us a long curved line\r\nof which the summits correspond to the heights of high water, while\r\nthe depressions are the corresponding points of low water. The long\r\nundulations of this curve are, however, very irregular. At spring\r\ntides, when the sun and the moon conspire, the elevations rise much\r\nhigher and the depressions sink much lower than they do at neap tides,\r\nwhen the high water raised by the moon is reduced by the action of the\r\nsun. There are also many minor irregularities which show the tides to\r\nbe not nearly such simple phenomena as might be at first supposed. But\r\nwhat we might hastily think of as irregularities are, in truth, the\r\nmost interesting parts of the whole phenomena. Just as in the\r\nobservations of the planets the study of the perturbations has led us\r\nto results of the widest interest and instruction, so it is these\r\nminor phenomena of the tides which seem most pregnant with scientific\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe tide-gauge gives us an elaborate curve. How are we to interpret\r\nthat curve? Here indeed a most beautiful mathematical theorem comes to\r\nour aid. Just as ordinary sounds consist of a number of undulations\r\nblended together, so the tidal wave consists of a number of distinct\r\nundulations superposed. Of these the ordinary lunar tide and the\r\nordinary solar tide are the two principal; but there are also minor\r\nundulations, harmonics, so to speak, some originating from the moon,\r\nsome originating from the sun, and some from both bodies acting in\r\nconcert.\r\n\r\nIn the study of sound we can employ an acoustic apparatus for the\r\npurpose of decomposing any proposed note, and finding not only the\r\nmain undulation itself, but the several superposed harmonics which\r\ngive to the note its timbre. So also we can analyze the undulation of\r\nthe tide, and show the component parts. The decomposition is effected\r\nby the process known as harmonic analysis. The principle of the\r\nmethod may be very simply described. Let us fix our attention on any\r\nparticular \"tide,\" for so the various elements are denoted. We can\r\nalways determine beforehand, with as much accuracy as we may require,\r\nwhat the period of that tide will be. For instance, the period of the\r\nlunar semi-diurnal tide will of course be half the average time\r\noccupied by the moon to travel round from the meridian of any place\r\nuntil it regains the same meridian; the period of the lunar diurnal\r\ntide will be double as great; and there are fortnightly tides, and\r\nothers of periods still greater. The essential point to notice is,\r\nthat the periods of these tides are given by purely astronomical\r\nconsiderations from the periods of the motions theory, and do not\r\ndepend upon the actual observations.\r\n\r\nWe measure off on the curve the height of the tide at intervals of an\r\nhour. The larger the number of such measures that are available the\r\nbetter; but even if there be only three hundred and sixty or seven\r\nhundred and twenty consecutive hours, then, as shown by Professor G.\r\nH. Darwin in the _Admiralty Manual_ already referred to, it will\r\nstill be possible to obtain a very competent knowledge of the tides in\r\nthe particular port where the gauge has been placed.\r\n\r\nThe art (for such indeed it may be described) of harmonic analysis\r\nconsists in deducing from the hourly observations the facts with\r\nregard to each of the constituent tides. This art has been carried to\r\nsuch perfection, that it has been reduced to a very simple series of\r\narithmetical operations. Indeed it has now been found possible to call\r\nin the aid of ingenious mechanism, by which the labours of computation\r\nare entirely superseded. The pointer of the harmonic analyzer has\r\nmerely to be traced over the curve which the tide-gauge has drawn, and\r\nit is the function of the machine to decompose the composite\r\nundulation into its parts, and to exhibit the several constituent\r\ntides whose confluence gives the total result.\r\n\r\nAs if nothing should be left to complete the perfection of a process\r\nwhich, both from its theoretical and its practical sides, is of such\r\nimportance, a machine for predicting tides has been designed,\r\nconstructed, and is now in ordinary use. When by the aid of the\r\nharmonic analysis the effectiveness of the several constituent tides\r\naffecting a port have become fully determined, it is of course\r\npossible to predict the tides for that port. Each \"tide\" is a simple\r\nperiodic rise and fall, and we can compute for any future time the\r\nheight of each were it acting alone. These heights can all be added\r\ntogether, and thus the height of the water is obtained. In this way a\r\ntide-table is formed, and such a table when complete will express not\r\nalone the hours and heights of high water on every day, but the height\r\nof the water at any intervening hour.\r\n\r\nThe computations necessary for this purpose are no doubt simple, so\r\nfar as their principle is concerned; but they are exceedingly tedious,\r\nand any process must be welcomed which affords mitigation of a task so\r\nlaborious. The entire theory of the tides owes much to Sir William\r\nThomson in the methods of observation and in the methods of reduction.\r\nHe has now completed the practical parts of the subject by inventing\r\nand constructing the famous tide-predicting engine.\r\n\r\nThe principle of this engine is comparatively simple. There is a chain\r\nwhich at one end is fixed, and at the other end carries the pencil\r\nwhich is pressed against the revolving drum on which the prediction is\r\nto be inscribed. Between its two ends the chain passes up and down\r\nover pulleys. Each pulley corresponds to one of the \"tides,\" and there\r\nare about a dozen altogether, some of which exercise but little\r\neffect. Of course if the centres of the pulleys were all fixed the pen\r\ncould not move, but the centre of each pulley describes a circle with\r\na radius proportional to the amplitude of the corresponding tide, and\r\nin a time proportional to the period of that tide. When these pulleys\r\nare all set so as to start at the proper phases, the motion is\r\nproduced by turning round a handle which makes the drum rotate, and\r\nsets all the pulleys in motion. The tide curve is thus rapidly drawn\r\nout; and so expeditious is the machine, that the tides of a port for\r\nan entire year can be completely worked out in a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nWhile the student or the philosopher who seeks to render any account\r\nof the tide on dynamical grounds is greatly embarrassed by the\r\ndifficulties introduced by friction, we, for our present purpose in\r\nthe study of the great romance of modern science opened up to us by\r\nthe theory of the tides, have to welcome friction as the agent which\r\ngives to the tides their significance from our point of view.\r\n\r\nThere is the greatest difference between the height of the rise and\r\nfall of the tide at different localities. Out in mid-ocean, for\r\ninstance, an island like St. Helena is washed by a tide only about\r\nthree feet in range; an enclosed sea like the Caspian is subject to no\r\nappreciable tides whatever, while the Mediterranean, notwithstanding\r\nits connection with the Atlantic, is still only subject to very\r\ninconsiderable tides, varying from one foot to a few feet. The\r\nstatement that water always finds its own level must be received, like\r\nmany another proposition in nature, with a considerable degree of\r\nqualification. Long ere one tide could have found its way through the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar in sufficient volume to have appreciably affected\r\nthe level of the great inland sea, its effects would have been\r\nobliterated by succeeding tides. On the other hand, there are certain\r\nlocalities which expose a funnel-shape opening to the sea; into these\r\nthe great tidal wave rushes, and as it passes onwards towards the\r\nnarrow part, the waters become piled up so as to produce tidal\r\nphenomena of abnormal proportions. Thus, in our own islands, we have\r\nin the Bristol Channel a wide mouth into which a great tide enters,\r\nand as it hurries up the Severn it produces the extraordinary\r\nphenomenon of the Bore. The Bristol Channel also concentrates the\r\ngreat wave which gives Chepstow and Cardiff a tidal range of\r\nthirty-seven or thirty-eight feet at springs, and forces the sea up\r\nthe river Avon so as to give Bristol a wonderful tide. There is hardly\r\nany more interesting spot in our islands for the observation of tides\r\nthan is found on Clifton Suspension Bridge. From that beautiful\r\nstructure you look down on a poor and not very attractive stream,\r\nwhich two hours later becomes transformed into a river of ample\r\nvolume, down which great ships are navigated. But of all places in the\r\nworld, the most colossal tidal phenomena are those in the Bay of\r\nFundy. Here the Atlantic passes into a long channel whose sides\r\ngradually converge. When the great pulse of the tide rushes up this\r\nchannel, it is gradually accumulated into a mighty volume at the\r\nupper end, the ebb and flow of which at spring tides extends through\r\nthe astonishing range of not less than fifty feet.\r\n\r\nThese discrepancies between the tides at different places are chiefly\r\ndue to the local formations of the coasts and the sea-beds. Indeed, it\r\nseems that if the whole earth were covered with an uniform and deep\r\nocean of water, the tides would be excessively feeble. On no other\r\nsupposition can we reasonably account for the fact that our barometric\r\nrecords fail to afford us any very distinct evidence as to the\r\nexistence of tides in the atmosphere. For you will, of course,\r\nremember that our atmosphere may be regarded as a deep and vast ocean\r\nof air, which embraces the whole earth, extending far above the\r\nloftiest summits of the mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the profoundest of nature's laws that wherever friction\r\ntakes place, energy has to be consumed. Perhaps I ought rather to say\r\ntransformed, for of course it is now well known that consumption of\r\nenergy in the sense of absolute loss is impossible. Thus, when energy\r\nis expended in moving a body in opposition to the force of friction,\r\nor in agitating a liquid, the energy which disappears in its\r\nmechanical form reappears in the form of heat. The agitation of water\r\nby paddles moving through it warms the water, and the accession of\r\nheat thus acquired measures the energy which has been expended in\r\nmaking the paddles rotate. The motion of a liquid of which the\r\nparticles move among each other with friction, can only be sustained\r\nby the incessant degradation of energy from the mechanical form into\r\nthe lower form of diffused heat. Thus the very fact that the tides are\r\nebbing and flowing, and that there is consequently incessant friction\r\ngoing on among all the particles of water in the ocean, shows us that\r\nthere must be some great store of energy constantly available to\r\nsupply the incessant draughts made upon it by the daily oscillation of\r\nthe tides. In addition to the mere friction between the particles of\r\nwater, there are also many other ways in which the tides proclaim to\r\nus that there is some great hoard of energy which is continually\r\naccessible to their wants. Stand on the bank of an estuary or river up\r\nand down which a great tidal current ebbs and flows; you will see the\r\nwater copiously charged with sediment which the tide is bearing along.\r\nEngineers are well aware of the potency of the tide as a vehicle for\r\ntransporting stupendous quantities of sand or mud. A sand-bank impedes\r\nthe navigation of a river; the removal of that sand-bank would be a\r\ntask, perhaps, conceivably possible by the use of steam dredges and\r\nother appliances, whereby vast quantities of sand could be raised and\r\ntransported to another locality where they would be innocuous. It is\r\nsometimes possible to effect the desired end by applying the power of\r\nthe tide. A sea-wall judiciously thrown out will sometimes concentrate\r\nthe tide into a much narrower channel. Its daily oscillations will be\r\naccomplished with greater vehemence, and as the tide rushes furiously\r\nbackwards and forwards over the obstacle, the incessant action will\r\ngradually remove it, and the impediment to navigation may be cleared\r\naway. Here we actually see the tides performing a piece of definite\r\nand very laborious work, to accomplish which by the more ordinary\r\nagents would be a stupendous task.\r\n\r\nIn some places the tides are actually harnessed so as to accomplish\r\nuseful work. I have read that underneath old London Bridge there used\r\nformerly to be great water-wheels, which were turned by the tide as it\r\nrushed up the river, and turned again, though in the opposite way, by\r\nthe ebbing tide. These wheels were, I believe, employed to pump up\r\nwater, though it does not seem obvious for what purposes the water\r\nwould have been suitable. Indeed in the ebb and flow all round our\r\ncoasts there is a potential source of energy which has hitherto been\r\nallowed to run to waste. The tide could be utilized in various ways.\r\nMany of you will remember the floating mills on the Rhine. They are\r\nvessels like paddle steamers anchored in the rapid current. The flow\r\nof the river makes the paddles rotate, and thus the machinery in the\r\ninterior is worked. Such craft moored in a rapid tide-way could also\r\nbe made to convey the power of the tides into the mechanism of the\r\nmill. Or there is still another method which has been employed, and\r\nwhich will perhaps have a future before it in those approaching times\r\nwhen the coal-cellars of England shall be exhausted. Imagine on the\r\nsea-coast a large flat extent which is inundated twice every day by\r\nthe tide. Let us build a stout wall round this area, and provide it\r\nwith a sluice-gate. Open the gate as the tide rises, and the great\r\npond will be filled; then at the moment of high water close the\r\nsluice, and the pond-full will be impounded. If at low tide the sluice\r\nbe opened the water will rush tumultuously out. Now suppose that a\r\nwater-wheel be provided, so that the rapid rush of water from the exit\r\nshall fall upon its blades; then a source of power is obviously the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, such a contrivance would naturally find no\r\nadvocates, for of course the commercial aspect of the question is that\r\nwhich will decide whether the scheme is practicable and economical.\r\nThe issue indeed can be very simply stated. Suppose that a given\r\nquantity of power be required--let us say that of one hundred horse.\r\nThen we have to consider the conditions under which a contrivance of\r\nthe kind we have sketched shall yield a power of this amount. Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson, in a very interesting address to the British\r\nAssociation at York in 1881, discussed this question, and I shall here\r\nmake use of the facts he brought forward on that occasion. He showed\r\nthat to obtain as much power as could be produced by a steam-engine\r\nof one hundred horse power, a very large reservoir would be required.\r\nIt is doubtful indeed whether there would be many localities on the\r\nearth which would be suitable for the purpose. Suppose, however, an\r\nestuary could be found which had an area of forty acres; then if a\r\nwall were thrown across the mouth so that the tide could be impounded,\r\nthe total amount of power that could be yielded by a water-wheel\r\nworked by the incessant influx and efflux of the tide would be equal\r\nto that yielded by the one hundred horse engine, running continuously\r\nfrom one end of the year to the other.\r\n\r\nThere are many drawbacks to a tide-mill of this description. In the\r\nfirst place, its situation would naturally be far removed from other\r\nconveniences necessary for manufacturing purposes. Then too there is\r\nthe great irregularity in the way in which the power is rendered\r\navailable. At certain periods during the twenty-four hours the mill\r\nwould stop running, and the hours when this happened would be\r\nconstantly changing. The inconvenience from the manufacturer's point\r\nof view of a deficiency of power during neap tides might not be\r\ncompensated by the fact that he had an excessive supply of power at\r\nspring-tides. Before tide-mills could be suitable for manufacturing\r\npurposes, some means must be found for storing away the energy when it\r\nis redundant, and applying it when its presence is required. We should\r\nwant in fact for great sources of energy some contrivance which shall\r\nfulfil the same purpose as the accumulators do in an electrical\r\ninstallation.\r\n\r\nEven then, however, the financial consideration remains, as to whether\r\nthe cost of building the dam and maintaining the tide-mill in good\r\norder will not on the whole exceed the original price and the charges\r\nfor the maintenance of a hundred horse power steam-engine. There\r\ncannot be a doubt that in this epoch of the earth's history, so long\r\nas the price of coal is only a few shillings a ton, the tide-mill,\r\neven though we seem to get its power without current expense, is\r\nvastly more expensive than a steam-engine. Indeed, Sir William Thomson\r\nremarks, that wherever a suitable tidal basin could be found, it would\r\nbe nearly as easy to reclaim the land altogether from the sea. And if\r\nthis were in any locality where manufactures were possible, the\r\ncommercial value of forty acres of reclaimed land would greatly exceed\r\nall the expenses attending the steam-engine. But when the time comes,\r\nas come it apparently will, that the price of coal shall have risen to\r\nseveral pounds a ton, the economical aspect of steam as compared with\r\nother prime movers will be greatly altered; it will then no doubt be\r\nfound advantageous to utilize great sources of energy, such as Niagara\r\nand the tides, which it is now more prudent to let run to waste.\r\n\r\nFor my argument, however, it matters little that the tides are not\r\nconstrained to do much useful work. They are always doing work of some\r\nkind, whether that be merely heating the particles of water by\r\nfriction, or vaguely transporting sand from one part of the ocean to\r\nthe other. Useful work or useless work are alike for the purpose of my\r\nargument. We know that work can never be done unless by the\r\nconsumption or transformation of energy. For each unit of work that is\r\ndone--whether by any machine or contrivance, by the muscles of man or\r\nany other animal, by the winds, the waves, or the tides, or in any\r\nother way whatever--a certain equivalent quantity of energy must have\r\nbeen expended. When, therefore, we see any work being performed, we\r\nmay always look for the source of energy to which the machine owes its\r\nefficiency. In fact, it is the old story illustrated, that perpetual\r\nmotion is impossible. A mechanical device, however ingenious may be\r\nthe construction, or however accurate the workmanship, can never\r\npossess what is called perpetual motion. It is needless to enter into\r\ndetails of any proposed contrivance of wheels, of pumps, of pulleys;\r\nit is sufficient to say that nothing in the shape of mechanism can\r\nwork without friction, that friction produces heat, that heat is a\r\nform of energy, and that to replace the energy consumed in producing\r\nthe heat there must be some source from which the machine is\r\nreplenished if its motion is to be continued indefinitely.\r\n\r\nHence, as the tides may be regarded as a machine doing work, we have\r\nto ascertain the origin of that energy which they are continually\r\nexpending. It is at this point that we first begin to feel the\r\ndifficulties inherent in the theory of tidal evolution. I do not mean\r\ndifficulties in the sense of doubts, for up to the present I have\r\nmentioned no doubtful point. When I come to such I shall give due\r\nwarning. By difficulties I now mean points which it is not easy to\r\nunderstand without a little dynamical theory; but we must face these\r\ndifficulties, and endeavour to elucidate them as well as we can.\r\n\r\nLet us first see what the sources of energy can possibly be on which\r\nthe tides are permitted to draw. Our course is simplified by the fact\r\nthat the energy of which we have to speak is of a mechanical\r\ndescription, that is to say, not involving heat or other more obscure\r\nforms of energy. A simple type of energy is that possessed by a\r\nclock-weight after the clock has been wound. A store of power is thus\r\nlaid up which is gradually doled out during the week in small\r\nquantities, second by second, to sustain the motion of the pendulum.\r\nThe energy in this case is due to the fact that the weight is\r\nattracted by the earth, and is yielded according as the weight sinks\r\ndownwards. In the separation between two mutually attracting bodies, a\r\nstore of energy is thus implied. What we learn from an ordinary clock\r\nmay be extended to the great bodies of the universe. The moon is a\r\ngigantic globe separated from our earth by a distance of 240,000\r\nmiles. The attraction between these two bodies always tends to bring\r\nthem together. No doubt the moon is not falling towards the earth as\r\nthe descending clock-weight is doing. We may, in fact, consider the\r\nmoon, so far as our present object is concerned, to be revolving\r\nalmost in a circle, of which the earth is the centre. If the moon,\r\nhowever, were to be stopped, it would at once commence to rush down\r\ntowards the earth, whither it would arrive with an awful crash in the\r\ncourse of four or five days. It is fortunately true that the moon does\r\nnot behave thus; but it has the ability of doing so, and thus the mere\r\nseparation between the earth and the moon involves the existence of a\r\nstupendous quantity of energy, capable under certain conditions of\r\nundergoing transformation.\r\n\r\nThere is also another source of mechanical energy besides that we have\r\njust referred to. A rapidly moving body possesses, in virtue of its\r\nmotion, a store of readily available energy, and it is easy to show\r\nthat energy of this type is capable of transformation into other\r\ntypes. Think of a cannon-ball rushing through the air at a speed of a\r\nthousand feet per second; it is capable of wreaking disaster on\r\nanything which it meets, simply because its rapid motion is the\r\nvehicle by which the energy of the gunpowder is transferred from the\r\ngun to where the blow is to be struck. Had the cannon been directed\r\nvertically upwards, then the projectile, leaving the muzzle with the\r\nsame initial velocity as before, would soar up and up, with gradually\r\nabating speed, until at last it reached a turning-point, the elevation\r\nof which would depend upon the initial velocity. Poised for a moment\r\nat the summit, the cannon-ball may then be likened to the\r\nclock-weight, for the entire energy which it possessed by its motion\r\nhas been transformed into the statical energy of a raised weight. Thus\r\nwe see these two forms of energy are mutually interchangeable. The\r\nraised weight if allowed to fall will acquire velocity, or the rapidly\r\nmoving weight if directed upwards will acquire altitude.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of energy which can be conveyed by a rapidly moving body\r\nincreases greatly with its speed. For instance, if the speed of the\r\nbody be doubled, the energy will be increased fourfold, or, in\r\ngeneral, the energy which a moving body possesses may be said to be\r\nproportional to the square of its speed. Here then we have another\r\nsource of the energy present in our earth-moon system; for the moon is\r\nhurrying along in its path with a speed of two-thirds of a mile per\r\nsecond, or about twice or three times the speed of a cannon-shot.\r\nHence the fact that the moon is continuously revolving in a circle\r\nshows us that it possesses a store of energy which is nine times as\r\ngreat as that which a cannon-ball as massive as the moon, and fired\r\nwith the ordinary velocity, would receive from the powder which\r\ndischarged it.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the moon is endowed with two sources of energy, one\r\nof which is due to its separation from the earth, and the other to the\r\nspeed of its motion. Though these are distinct, they are connected\r\ntogether by a link which it is important for us to comprehend. The\r\nspeed with which the moon revolves around the earth is connected with\r\nthe moon's distance from the earth. The moon might, for instance,\r\nrevolve in a larger circle than that which it actually pursues; but\r\nif it did so, the speed of its motion would have to be appropriately\r\nlessened. The orbit of the moon might have a much smaller radius than\r\nit has at present, provided that the speed was sufficiently increased\r\nto compensate for the increased attraction which the earth would\r\nexercise at the lessened distance. Indeed, I am here only stating what\r\nevery one is familiar with under the form of Kepler's Law, that the\r\nsquare of the periodic time is in proportion to the cube of the mean\r\ndistance. To each distance of the moon therefore belongs an\r\nappropriate speed. The energy due to the moon's position and the\r\nenergy due to its motion are therefore connected together. One of\r\nthese quantities cannot be altered without the other undergoing\r\nchange. If the moon's orbit were increased there would be a gain of\r\nenergy due to the enlarged distance, and a loss of energy due to the\r\ndiminished speed. These would not, however, exactly compensate. On the\r\nwhole, we may represent the total energy of the moon as a single\r\nquantity, which increases when the distance of the moon from the earth\r\nincreases, and lessens when the distance from the earth to the moon\r\nlessens. For simplicity we may speak of this as moon-energy.\r\n\r\nBut the most important constituent of the store of energy in the\r\nearth-moon system is that contributed by the earth itself. I do not\r\nnow speak of the energy due to the velocity of the earth in its orbit\r\nround the sun. The moon indeed participates in this equally with the\r\nearth, but it does not affect those mutual actions between the earth\r\nand moon with which we are at present concerned. We are, in fact,\r\ndiscussing the action of that piece of machinery the earth-moon\r\nsystem; and its action is not affected by the circumstance that the\r\nentire machine is being bodily transported around the sun in a great\r\nannual voyage. This has little more to do with the action of our\r\npresent argument than has the fact that a man is walking about to do\r\nwith the motions of the works of the watch in his pocket. We shall,\r\nhowever, have to allude to this subject further on.\r\n\r\nThe energy of the earth which is significant in the earth-moon theory\r\nis due to the earth's rotation upon its axis. We may here again use as\r\nan illustration the action of machinery; and the special contrivance\r\nthat I now refer to is the punching-engine that is used in our\r\nship-building works. In preparing a plate of iron to be riveted to the\r\nside of a ship, a number of holes have to be made all round the margin\r\nof the plate. These holes must be half an inch or more in diameter,\r\nand the plate is sometimes as much as, or more than, half an inch in\r\nthickness. The holes are produced in the metal by forcing a steel\r\npunch through it; and this is accomplished without even heating the\r\nplate so as to soften the iron. It is needless to say that an intense\r\nforce must be applied to the punch. On the other hand, the distance\r\nthrough which the punch has to be moved is comparatively small. The\r\npunch is attached to the end of a powerful lever, the other end of the\r\nlever is raised by a cam, so as to depress the punch to do its work.\r\nAn essential part of the machine is a small but heavy fly-wheel\r\nconnected by gearing with the cam.\r\n\r\nThis fly-wheel when rapidly revolving contains within it, in virtue of\r\nits motion, a large store of energy which has gradually accumulated\r\nduring the time that the punch is not actually in action. The energy\r\nis no doubt originally supplied from a steam-engine. What we are\r\nespecially concerned with is the action of the rapidly rotating wheel\r\nas a reservoir in which a large store of energy can be conveniently\r\nmaintained until such time as it is wanted. In the action of punching,\r\nwhen the steel die comes down upon the surface of the plate, a large\r\nquantity of energy is suddenly demanded to force the punch against the\r\nintense resistance it experiences; the energy for this purpose is\r\ndrawn from the store in the fly-wheel, which experiences no doubt a\r\ncheck in its velocity, to be regained again from the energy of the\r\nengine during the interval which elapses before the punch is called on\r\nto make the next hole.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the fly-wheel on a splendid scale is seen in\r\nour mighty steel works, where ponderous rails are being manufactured.\r\nA white-hot ingot of steel is presented to a pair of powerful rollers,\r\nwhich grip the steel, and send it through at the other side both\r\ncompressed and elongated. Tremendous power is required to meet the\r\nsudden demand on the machine at the critical moment. To obtain this\r\npower an engine of stupendous proportions is sometimes attached\r\ndirectly to the rollers, but more frequently an engine of rather less\r\nhorse-power will be used, the might of this engine being applied to\r\ngiving rapid rotation to an immense fly-wheel, which may thus be\r\nregarded as a reservoir full of energy. The rolling mills then obtain\r\nfrom this store in the fly-wheel whatever energy is necessary for\r\ntheir gigantic task.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations will suffice to show how a rapidly rotating body\r\nmay contain energy in virtue of its rotation, just as a cannon-ball\r\ncontains energy in virtue of its speed of translation, or as a\r\nclock-weight has energy in virtue of the fact that it has some\r\ndistance to fall before it reaches the earth. The rotating body need\r\nnot necessarily have the shape of a wheel--it may be globular in form;\r\nnor need the axes of rotation be fixed in bearings, like those of the\r\nfly-wheel; nor of course is there any limit to the dimensions which\r\nthe rotating body may assume. Our earth is, in fact, a vast rotating\r\nbody 8000 miles in diameter, and turning round upon its axis once\r\nevery twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes. Viewed in this way,\r\nthe earth is to be regarded as a gigantic fly-wheel containing a\r\nquantity of energy great in correspondence with the earth's mass. The\r\namount of energy which can be stored by rotation also depends upon the\r\nsquare of the velocity with which the body turns round; thus if our\r\nearth turned round in half the time which it does at present, that is,\r\nif the day was twelve hours instead of twenty-four hours, the energy\r\ncontained in virtue of that rotation would be four times its present\r\namount.\r\n\r\nReverting now to the earth-moon system, the energy which that system\r\ncontains consists essentially of two parts--the moon-energy, whose\r\ncomposite character I have already explained, and the earth-energy,\r\nwhich has its origin solely in the rotation of the earth on its axis.\r\nIt is necessary to observe that these are essentially distinct--there\r\nis no necessary relation between the speed of the earth's rotation and\r\nthe distance of the moon, such as there is between the distance of the\r\nmoon and the speed with which it revolves in its orbit.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, it ought to be added that there is also some energy\r\ndue to the moon's rotation on its axis, but this is very small for\r\ntwo reasons: first, because the moon is small compared with the\r\nearth, and second, because the angular velocity of the moon is also\r\nvery small compared with that of the earth. We may therefore dismiss\r\nas insignificant the contributions from this source of energy to the\r\nsum total.\r\n\r\nI have frequently used illustrations derived from machinery, but I\r\nwant now to emphasize the profound distinction that exists between the\r\nrotation of the earth and the rotation of a fly-wheel in a machine\r\nshop. They are both, no doubt, energy-holders, but it must be borne in\r\nmind, that as the fly-wheel doles out its energy to supply the wants\r\nof the machines with which it is connected, a restitution of its store\r\nis continually going on by the action of the engine, so that on the\r\nwhole the speed of the fly-wheel does not slacken. The earth, however,\r\nmust be likened to a fly-wheel which has been disconnected with the\r\nengine. If, therefore, the earth have to supply certain demands on its\r\naccumulation of energy, it can only do so by a diminution of its\r\nhoard, and this involves a sacrifice of some of its speed.\r\n\r\nIn the earth-moon system there is no engine at hand to restore the\r\nlosses of energy which are inevitable when work has to be done. But we\r\nhave seen that work is done; we have shown, in fact, that the tides\r\nare at present doing work, and have been doing work for as long a\r\nperiod in the past as our imagination can extend to. The energy which\r\nthis work has necessitated can only have been drawn from the existing\r\nstore in the system; that energy consists of two parts--the\r\nmoon-energy and the earth's rotation energy. The problem therefore for\r\nus to consider is, which of these two banks the tides have drawn on to\r\nmeet their constant expenditure. This is not a question that can be\r\ndecided offhand; in fact, if we attempt to decide it in an offhand\r\nmanner we shall certainly go wrong. It seems so very plausible to say\r\nthat as the moon causes the tides, therefore the energy which these\r\ntides expend should be contributed by the moon. But this is not the\r\ncase. It actually happens that though the moon does cause the tides,\r\nyet when those tides consume energy they draw it not from the distant\r\nmoon, but from the vast supply which they find ready to their hand,\r\nstored up in the rotation of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of this is not a very simple matter; in fact, it is\r\nso far from being simple that many philosophers, including some\r\neminent ones too, while admitting that of course the tides must have\r\ndrawn their energy from one or other or both of these two sources, yet\r\nfound themselves unable to assign how the demand was distributed\r\nbetween the two conceivable sources of supply.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Professor Purser of Belfast for having indicated\r\nthe true dynamical principle on which the problem depends. It involves\r\nreasoning based simply on the laws of motion and on elementary\r\nmathematics, but not in the least involving questions of astronomical\r\nobservation. It would be impossible for me in a lecture like this to\r\ngive any explanation of the mathematical principles referred to. I\r\nshall, however, endeavour by some illustrations to set before you what\r\nthis profound principle really is. Were I to give it the old name I\r\nshould call it the law of the conservation of areas; the more modern\r\nwriters, however, speak of it as the conservation of moment of\r\nmomentum, an expression which exhibits the nature of the principle in\r\na more definite manner.\r\n\r\nI do not see how to give any very accurate illustration of what this\r\nlaw means, but I must make the attempt, and if you think the\r\nillustration beneath the dignity of the subject, I can only plead the\r\ndifficulty of mathematics as an excuse. Let us suppose that a\r\nball-room is fairly filled with dancers, or those willing to dance,\r\nand that a merry waltz is being played; the couples have formed, and\r\nthe floor is occupied with pairs who are whirling round and round in\r\nthat delightful amusement. Some couples drop out for a while and\r\nothers strike in; the fewer couples there are the wider is the range\r\naround which they can waltz, the more numerous the couples the less\r\nindividual range will they possess. I want you to realize that in the\r\nprogress of the dance there is a certain total quantity of spin at any\r\nmoment in progress; this spin is partly made up of the rotation by\r\nwhich each dancer revolves round his partner, and partly of the\r\ncircular orbit about the room which each couple endeavours to\r\ndescribe. If there are too many couples on the floor for the general\r\nenjoyment of the dance, then both the orbit and the angular velocity\r\nof each couple will be restricted by the interference with their\r\nneighbours. We may, however, assert that so long as the dance is in\r\nfull swing the total quantity of spin, partly rotational and partly\r\norbital, will remain constant. When there are but few couples the\r\nunimpeded rotation and the large orbits will produce as much spin as\r\nwhen there is a much larger number of couples, for in the latter case\r\nthe diminished freedom will lessen the quantity of spin produced by\r\neach individual pair. It will sometimes happen too that collision will\r\ntake place, but the slight diversions thus arising only increase the\r\ngeneral merriment, so that the total quantity of spin may be\r\nsustained, even though one or two couples are placed temporarily _hors\r\nde combat_. I have invoked a ball-room for the purpose of bringing out\r\nwhat we may call the law of the conservation of spin. No matter how\r\nmuch the individual performers may change, or no matter what\r\nvicissitudes arise from their collision and other mutual actions, yet\r\nthe total quantity of spin remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the earth-moon system. The law of the conservation of\r\nmoment of momentum may, with sufficient accuracy for our present\r\npurpose, be interpreted to mean that the total quantity of spin in the\r\nsystem remains unaltered. In our system the spin is threefold; there\r\nis first the rotation of the earth on its axis, there is the rotation\r\nof the moon on its axis, and then there is the orbital revolution of\r\nthe moon around the earth. The law to which we refer asserts that the\r\ntotal quantity of these three spins, each estimated in the proper way,\r\nwill remain constant. It matters not that tides may ebb and flow, or\r\nthat the distribution of the spin shall vary, but its total amount\r\nremains inflexibly constant. One constituent of the total amount--that\r\nis, the rotation of the moon on its axis--is so insignificant, that\r\nfor our present purposes it may be entirely disregarded. We may\r\ntherefore assert that the amount of spin in the earth, due to its\r\nrotation round its axis, added to the amount of spin in the moon due\r\nto its revolution round the earth, remains unalterable. If one of\r\nthese quantities change by increase or by decrease, the other must\r\ncorrespondingly change by decrease or by increase. If, therefore, from\r\nany cause, the earth began to spin a little more quickly round its\r\naxis, the moon must do a little less spin; and consequently, it must\r\nshorten its distance from the earth. Or suppose that the earth's\r\nvelocity of rotation is abated, then its contribution to the total\r\namount of spin is lessened; the deficiency must therefore be made up\r\nby the moon, but this can only be done by an enlargement of the moon's\r\norbit. I should add, as a caution, that these results are true only on\r\nthe supposition that the earth-moon system is isolated from all\r\nexternal interference. With this proviso, however, it matters not what\r\nmay happen to the earth or moon, or what influence one of them may\r\nexert upon the other, no matter what tides may be raised, no matter\r\neven if the earth fly into fragments, the whole quantity of spin of\r\nall those fragments would, if added to the spin of the moon, yield the\r\nsame unalterable total. We are here in possession of a most valuable\r\ndynamical principle. We are not concerned with any special theory as\r\nto the action of the tides; it is sufficient for us that in some way\r\nor other the tides have been caused by the moon, and that being so,\r\nthe principle of the conservation of spin will apply.\r\n\r\nWere the earth and the moon both rigid bodies, then there could be of\r\ncourse no tides on the earth, it being rigid and devoid of ocean. The\r\nrotation of the earth on its axis would therefore be absolutely\r\nwithout change, and therefore the necessary condition of the\r\nconservation of spin would be very simply attained by the fact that\r\nneither of the constituent parts changed. The earth, however, not\r\nbeing entirely rigid, and being subject to tides, this simple state of\r\nthings cannot continue; there must be some change in progress.\r\n\r\nI have already shown that the fact of the ebbing and the flowing of\r\nthe tide necessitates an expenditure of energy, and we saw that this\r\nenergy must come either from that stored up in the earth by its\r\nrotation, or from that possessed by the moon in virtue of its distance\r\nand revolution. The law of the conservation of spin will enable us to\r\ndecide at once as to whence the tides get their energy. Suppose they\r\ntook it from the moon, the moon would then lose in energy, and\r\nconsequently come nearer the earth. The quantity of spin contributed\r\nby the moon would therefore be lessened, and accordingly the spin to\r\nbe made up by the earth would be increased. That means, of course,\r\nthat the velocity of the earth rotating on its axis must be increased,\r\nand this again would necessitate an increase in the earth's rotational\r\nenergy. It can be shown, too, that to keep the total spin right, the\r\nenergy of the earth would have to gain more than the moon would have\r\nlost by revolving in a smaller orbit. Thus we find that the total\r\nquantity of energy in the system would be increased. This would lead\r\nto the absurd result that the action of the tides manufactured energy\r\nin our system. Of course, such a doctrine cannot be true; it would\r\namount to a perpetual motion! We might as well try to get a\r\nsteam-engine which would produce enough heat by friction not only to\r\nsupply its own boilers, but to satisfy all the thermal wants of the\r\nwhole parish. We must therefore adopt the other alternative. The tides\r\ndo not draw their energy from the moon; they draw it from the store\r\npossessed by the earth in virtue of its rotation.\r\n\r\nWe can now state the end of this rather long discussion in a very\r\nsimple and brief manner. Energy can only be yielded by the earth at\r\nthe expense of some of the speed of its rotation. The tides must\r\ntherefore cause the earth to revolve more slowly; in other words, _the\r\ntides are increasing the length of the day_.\r\n\r\nThe earth therefore loses some of its velocity of rotation;\r\nconsequently it does less than its due share of the total quantity of\r\nspin, and an increased quantity of spin must therefore be accomplished\r\nby the moon; but this can only be done by an enlargement of its orbit.\r\nThus there are two great consequences of the tides in the earth-moon\r\nsystem--the days are getting longer, the moon is receding further.\r\n\r\nThese points are so important that I shall try and illustrate them in\r\nanother way, which will show, at all events, that one and both of\r\nthese tidal phenomena commend themselves to our common sense. Have we\r\nnot shown how the tides in their ebb and flow are incessantly\r\nproducing friction, and have we not also likened the earth to a great\r\nwheel? When the driver wants to stop a railway train the brakes are\r\nput on, and the brake is merely a contrivance for applying friction to\r\nthe circumference of a wheel for the purpose of checking its motion.\r\nOr when a great weight is being lowered by a crane, the motion is\r\nchecked by a band which applies friction on the circumference of a\r\nwheel, arranged for the special purpose. Need we then be surprised\r\nthat the friction of the tides acts like a brake on the earth, and\r\ngradually tends to check its mighty rotation? The progress of\r\nlengthening the day by the tides is thus readily intelligible. It is\r\nnot quite so easy to see why the ebbing and the flowing of the tide on\r\nthe earth should actually have the effect of making the moon to\r\nretreat; this phenomenon is in deference to a profound law of nature,\r\nwhich tells us that action and reaction are equal and opposite to each\r\nother. If I might venture on a very homely illustration, I may say\r\nthat the moon, like a troublesome fellow, is constantly annoying the\r\nearth by dragging its waters backward and forward by means of tides;\r\nand the earth, to free itself from this irritating interference, tries\r\nto push off the aggressor and to make him move further away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nAnother way in which we can illustrate the retreat of the moon as the\r\ninevitable consequence of tidal friction is shown in the adjoining\r\nfigure, in which the large body E represents the earth, and the small\r\nbody M the moon. We may for simplicity regard the moon as a point, and\r\nas this attracts each particle of the earth, the total effect of the\r\nmoon on the earth may be represented by a single force. By the law of\r\nequality of action and reaction, the force of the earth on the moon is\r\nto be represented by an equal and opposite force. If there were no\r\ntides then the moon's force would of course pass through the earth's\r\ncentre; but as the effect of the moon is to slacken the earth's\r\nrotation, it follows that the total force does not exactly pass\r\nthrough the line of the earth's centre, but a little to one side, in\r\norder to pull the opposite way to that in which the earth is turning,\r\nand thus bring down its speed. We may therefore decompose the earth's\r\ntotal force on the moon into two parts, one of which tends directly\r\ntowards the earth's centre, while the other acts tangentially to the\r\nmoon's orbit. The central force is of course the main guiding power\r\nwhich keeps the moon in its path; but the incessant tangential force\r\nconstantly tends to send the moon out further and further, and thus\r\nthe growth of its orbit can be accounted for.\r\n\r\nWe therefore conclude finally, that the tides are making the day\r\nlonger and sending the moon away further. It is the development of the\r\nconsequences of these laws that specially demands our attention in\r\nthese lectures. We must have the courage to look at the facts\r\nunflinchingly, and deduce from them all the wondrous consequences they\r\ninvolve. Their potency arises from a characteristic feature--they are\r\nunintermitting. Most of the great astronomical changes with which we\r\nare ordinarily familiar are really periodic: they gradually increase\r\nin one direction for years, for centuries, or for untold ages; but\r\nthen a change comes, and the increase is changed into a decrease, so\r\nthat after the lapse of becoming periods the original state of things\r\nis restored. Such periodic phenomena abound in astronomy. There is the\r\nannual fluctuation of the seasons; there is the eighteen or nineteen\r\nyear period of the moon; there is the great period of the precession\r\nof the equinoxes, amounting to twenty-six thousand years; and then\r\nthere is the stupendous Annus Magnus of hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears, during which the earth's orbit itself breathes in and out in\r\nresponse to the attraction of the planets. But these periodic\r\nphenomena, however important they may be to us mere creatures of a\r\nday, are insignificant in their effects on the grand evolution through\r\nwhich the celestial bodies are passing. The really potent agents in\r\nfashioning the universe are those which, however slow or feeble they\r\nmay seem to be, are still incessant in their action. The effect which\r\na cause shall be competent to produce depends not alone upon the\r\nintensity of that cause, but also upon the time during which it has\r\nbeen in operation. From the phenomena of geology, as well as from\r\nthose of astronomy, we know that this earth and the system to which it\r\nbelongs has endured for ages, not to be counted by scores of thousands\r\nof years, or, as Prof. Tyndall has so well remarked, \"Not for six\r\nthousand years, nor for sixty thousand years, nor six hundred thousand\r\nyears, but for æons of untold millions.\" Those slender agents which\r\nhave devoted themselves unceasingly to the accomplishment of a single\r\ntask may in this long lapse of time have accomplished results of\r\nstupendous magnitude. In famed stalactite caverns we are shown a\r\ncolossal figure of crystal extending from floor to roof, and the\r\nformation of that column is accounted for when we see a tiny drop\r\nfalling from the roof above to the floor beneath. A lifetime may not\r\nsuffice for that falling drop to add an appreciable increase to the\r\nstalactite down which it trickles, or to the growing stalagmite on\r\nwhich it falls; but when the operation has been in progress for\r\nimmense ages, it is capable of the formation of the stately column.\r\nHere we have an illustration of an influence which, though apparently\r\ntrivial, acquires colossal significance when adequate time is\r\nafforded. It is phenomena of this kind which the student of nature\r\nshould most narrowly watch, for they are the real architects of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nThe tidal consequences which we have already demonstrated are\r\nemphatically of this non-periodic class--the day is always\r\nlengthening, the moon is always retreating. To-day is longer than\r\nyesterday; to-morrow will be longer than to-day. It cannot be said\r\nthat the change is a great one; it is indeed too small to be\r\nappreciable even by our most delicate observations. In one thousand\r\nyears the alteration in the length of a day is only a small fraction\r\nof a second; but what may be a very small matter in one thousand years\r\ncan become a very large one in many millions of years. Thus it is that\r\nwhen we stretch our view through immense vistas of time past, or when\r\nwe look forward through immeasurable ages of time to come, the\r\nalteration in the length of the day will assume the most startling\r\nproportions, and involve the most momentous consequences.\r\n\r\nLet us first look back. There was a time when the day, instead of\r\nbeing the twenty-four hours we now have, must have been only\r\ntwenty-three hours, How many millions of years ago that was I do not\r\npretend to say, nor is the point material for our argument; suffice it\r\nto say, that assuming, as geology assures us we may assume, the\r\nexistence of these æons of millions of years, there was once a time\r\nwhen the day was not only one hour shorter, but was even several hours\r\nless than it is at present. Nor need we stop our retrospect at a day\r\nof even twenty, or fifteen, or ten hours long; we shall at once\r\nproject our glance back to an immeasurably remote epoch, at which the\r\nearth was spinning round in a time only one sixth or even less of the\r\nlength of the present day. There is here a reason for our retrospect\r\nto halt, for at some eventful period, when the day was about three or\r\nfour hours long, the earth must have been in a condition of a very\r\ncritical kind.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that fearful accidents occasionally happen where\r\nlarge grindstones are being driven at a high speed. The velocity of\r\nrotation becomes too great for the tenacity of the stone to withstand\r\nthe stress; a rupture takes place, the stone flies in pieces, and huge\r\nfragments are hurled around. For each particular grindstone there is\r\na certain special velocity depending upon its actual materials and\r\ncharacter, at which it would inevitably fly in pieces. I have once\r\nbefore likened our earth to a wheel; now let me liken it to a\r\ngrindstone. There is therefore a certain critical velocity of rotation\r\nfor the earth at which it would be on the brink of rupture. We cannot\r\nexactly say, in our ignorance of the internal constitution of the\r\nearth, what length of day would be the shortest possible for our earth\r\nto have consistently with the preservation of its integrity; we may,\r\nhowever, assume that it will be about three or four hours, or perhaps\r\na little less than three. The exact amount, however, is not really\r\nvery material to us; it would be sufficient for our argument to assert\r\nthat there is a certain minimum length of day for which the earth can\r\nhold together. In our retrospect, therefore, through the abyss of time\r\npast our view must be bounded by that state of the earth when it is\r\nrevolving in this critical period. With what happened before that we\r\nshall not at present concern ourselves. Thus we look back to a time at\r\nthe beginning of the present order of things, when the day was only\r\nsome three or four hours long.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the moon, and examine where it must have been\r\nduring these past ages. As the moon is gradually getting further and\r\nfurther from us at present, so, looking back into past time, we find\r\nthat the moon was nearer and nearer to the earth the further back our\r\nview extends; in fact, concentrating our attention solely on essential\r\nfeatures, we may say that the path of the moon is a sort of spiral\r\nwhich winds round and round the earth, gradually getting larger,\r\nthough with extreme slowness. Looking back we see this spiral\r\ngradually coiling in and in, until in a retrospect of millions of\r\nyears, instead of its distance from the earth being 240,000 miles, it\r\nmust have been much less. There was a time when the moon was only\r\n200,000 miles away; there was a time many millions of years ago, when\r\nthe moon was only 100,000 miles away. Nor can we here stop our\r\nretrospect; we must look further and further back, and follow the\r\nmoon's spiral path as it creeps in and in towards the earth, until at\r\nlast it appears actually in contact with that great globe of ours,\r\nfrom which it is now separated by a quarter of a million of miles.\r\n\r\nSurely the tides have thus led us to the knowledge of an astounding\r\nepoch in our earth's past history, when the earth is spinning round in\r\na few hours, and when the moon is, practically speaking, in contact\r\nwith it. Perhaps I should rather say, that the materials of our\r\npresent moon were in this situation, for we would hardly be entitled\r\nto assume that the moon then possessed the same globular form in which\r\nwe see it now. To form a just apprehension of the true nature of both\r\nbodies at this critical epoch, we must study their concurrent history\r\nas it is disclosed to us by a totally different line of reasoning.\r\n\r\nDrop, then, for a moment all thought of tides, and let us bring to our\r\naid the laws of heat, which will disclose certain facts in the ancient\r\nhistory of the earth-moon system perhaps as astounding as those to\r\nwhich the tides have conducted us. In one respect we may compare these\r\nlaws of heat with the laws of the tides; they are both alike\r\nnon-periodic, their effects are cumulative from age to age, and\r\nimagination can hardly even impose a limit to the magnificence of the\r\nworks they can accomplish. Our argument from heat is founded on a\r\nvery simple matter. It is quite obvious that a heated body tends to\r\ngrow cold. I am not now speaking of fires or of actual combustion\r\nwhereby heat is produced; I am speaking merely of such heat as would\r\nbe possessed by a red-hot poker after being taken from the fire, or by\r\nan iron casting after the metal has been run into the mould. In such\r\ncases as this the general law holds good, that the heated body tends\r\nto grow cold. The cooling may be retarded no doubt if the passage of\r\nheat from the body is impeded. We can, for instance, retard the\r\ncooling of a teapot by the well-known practice of putting a cosy upon\r\nit; but the law remains that, slowly or quickly, the heated body will\r\ntend to grow colder. It seems almost puerile to insist with any\r\nemphasis on a point so obvious as this, but yet I frequently find that\r\npeople do not readily apprehend all the gigantic consequences that can\r\nflow from a principle so simple. It is true that a poker cools when\r\ntaken from the fire; we also find that a gigantic casting weighing\r\nmany tons will grow gradually cold, though it may require days to do\r\nso. The same principle will extend to any object, no matter how vast\r\nit may happen to be. Were that great casting 2000 miles in diameter,\r\nor were it 8000 miles in diameter, it will still steadily part with\r\nits heat, though no doubt the process of cooling becomes greatly\r\nprolonged with an increase in the dimensions of the heated body. The\r\nearth and the moon cannot escape from the application of these simple\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nLet us first speak of the earth. There are multitudes of volcanoes in\r\naction at the present moment in various countries upon this earth. Now\r\nwhatever explanation may be given of the approximate cause of the\r\nvolcanic phenomena, there can be no doubt that they indicate the\r\nexistence of heat in the interior of the earth. It may possibly be, as\r\nsome have urged, that the volcanoes are merely vents for comparatively\r\nsmall masses of subterranean molten matter; it may be, as others more\r\nreasonably, in my opinion, believe, that the whole interior of the\r\nearth is at the temperature of incandescence, and that the eruptions\r\nof volcanoes and the shocks of earthquakes are merely consequences of\r\nthe gradual shrinkage of the external crust, as it continually strives\r\nto accommodate itself to the lessening bulk of the fluid interior.\r\nBut whichever view we may adopt, it is at least obvious that the earth\r\nis in part, at all events, a heated body, and that the heat is not in\r\nthe nature of a combustion, generated and sustained by the progress of\r\nchemical action. No doubt there may be local phenomena of this\r\ndescription, but by far the larger proportion of the earth's internal\r\nheat seems merely the fervour of incandescence. It is to be likened to\r\nthe heat of the molten iron which has been run into the sand, rather\r\nthan to the glowing coals in the furnace in which that iron has been\r\nsmelted.\r\n\r\nThere is one volcanic outbreak of such exceptional interest in these\r\nmodern times that I cannot refrain from alluding to it. Doubtless\r\nevery one has heard of that marvellous eruption of Krakatoa, which\r\noccurred on August 26th and 27th, 1883, and gives a unique chapter in\r\nthe history of volcanic phenomena. Not alone was the eruption of\r\nKrakatoa alarming in its more ordinary manifestations, but it was\r\nunparalleled both in the vehemence of the shock and in the distance to\r\nwhich the effects of the great eruption were propagated. I speak not\r\nnow of the great waves of ocean that inundated the coasts of Sumatra\r\nand Java, and swept away thirty-six thousand people, nor do I allude\r\nto the intense darkness which spread for one hundred and eighty miles\r\nor more all round. I shall just mention the three most important\r\nphenomena, which demonstrate the energy which still resides in the\r\ninterior of our earth. Place a terrestrial globe before you, and fix\r\nyour attention on the Straits of Sunda; think also of the great\r\natmospheric ocean some two or three hundred miles deep which envelopes\r\nour earth. When a pebble is tossed into a pond a beautiful series of\r\nconcentric ripples diverge from it; so when Krakatoa burst up in that\r\nmighty catastrophe, a series of gigantic waves were propagated through\r\nthe air; they embraced the whole globe, converged to the antipodes of\r\nKrakatoa, thence again diverged, and returned to the seat of the\r\nvolcano; a second time the mighty series of atmospheric ripples spread\r\nto the antipodes, and a second time returned. Seven times did that\r\nseries of waves course over our globe, and leave their traces on every\r\nself-recording barometer that our earth possesses. Thirty-six hours\r\nwere occupied in the journey of the great undulation from Krakatoa to\r\nits antipodes. Perhaps even more striking was the extent of our\r\nearth's surface over which the noise of the great explosion spread. At\r\nBatavia, ninety-four miles away, the concussions were simply\r\ndeafening; at Macassar, in Celebes, two steamers were sent out to\r\ninvestigate the explosions which were heard, little thinking that they\r\ncame from Krakatoa, nine hundred and sixty-nine miles away. Alarming\r\nsounds were heard over the island of Timor, one thousand three hundred\r\nand fifty-one miles away from Krakatoa. Diego Garcia in the Chogos\r\nislands is two thousand two hundred and sixty-seven miles from\r\nKrakatoa, but the thunders traversed even this distance, and were\r\nattributed to some ship in distress, for which a search was made. Most\r\nastounding of all, there is undoubted evidence that the sound of the\r\nmighty explosion was propagated across nearly the entire Indian ocean,\r\nand was heard in the island of Rodriguez, almost three thousand miles\r\naway. The immense distance over which this sound journeyed will be\r\nappreciated by the fact, that the noise did not reach Rodriguez until\r\nfour hours after it had left Krakatoa. In fact, it would seem that if\r\nVesuvius were to explode with the same vehemence as Krakatoa did, the\r\nthunders of the explosion might penetrate so far as to be heard in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThere is another and more beautiful manifestation of the world-wide\r\nsignificance of the Krakatoa outbreak. The vast column of smoke and\r\nashes ascended twenty miles high in the air, and commenced a series of\r\nvoyages around the equatorial regions of the earth. In three days it\r\ncrossed the Indian ocean, and was traversing equatorial Africa; then\r\ncame an Atlantic voyage; and then it coursed over central America,\r\nbefore a Pacific voyage brought it back to its point of departure\r\nafter thirteen days; then the dust started again, and was traced\r\naround another similar circuit, while it was even tracked for a\r\nconsiderable time in placing the third girdle round the earth. Strange\r\nblue suns and green moons and other mysterious phenomena marked the\r\nprogress of this vast volcanic cloud. At last the cloud began to lose\r\nits density, the dust spread more widely over the tropics, became\r\ndiffused through the temperate regions, and then the whole earth was\r\nable to participate in the glories of Krakatoa. The marvellous sunsets\r\nin the autumn of 1883 are attributable to this cause; and thus once\r\nagain was brought before us the fact that the earth still contains\r\nlarge stores of thermal energy.\r\n\r\nAttempts are sometimes made to explain volcanic phenomena on the\r\nsupposition that they are entirely of a local character, and that we\r\nare not entitled to infer the incandescent nature of the earth's\r\ninterior from the fact that volcanic outbreaks occasionally happen.\r\nFor our present purpose this point is immaterial, though I must say it\r\nappears to me unreasonable to deny that the interior of the earth is\r\nin a most highly heated state. Every test we can apply shows us the\r\nexistence of internal heat. Setting aside the more colossal phenomena\r\nof volcanic eruptions, we have innumerable minor manifestations of its\r\npresence. Are there not geysers and hot springs in many parts of the\r\nearth? and have we not all over our globe invariable testimony\r\nconfirming the statement, that the deeper we go down beneath its\r\nsurface the hotter does the temperature become? Every miner is\r\nfamiliar with these facts; he knows that the deeper are his shafts the\r\nwarmer it is down below, and the greater the necessity for providing\r\nincreased ventilation to keep the temperature within a limit that\r\nshall be suitable for the workmen. All these varied classes of\r\nphenomena admit solely of one explanation, and that is, that the\r\ninterior of the earth contains vast stores of incandescent heat.\r\n\r\nWe now apply to our earth the same reasoning which we should employ on\r\na poker taken from the fire, or on a casting drawn from the foundry.\r\nSuch bodies will lose their heat by radiation and conduction. The\r\nearth is therefore losing its heat. No doubt the process is an\r\nextremely slow one. The mighty reservoirs of internal heat are covered\r\nby vast layers of rock, which are such excellent non-conductors that\r\nthey offer every possible impediment to the leakage of heat from the\r\ninterior to the surface. We coat our steam-pipes over with\r\nnon-conducting material, and this can now be done so successfully,\r\nthat it is beginning to be found economical to transmit steam for a\r\nvery long distance through properly protected pipes. But no\r\nnon-conducting material that we can manufacture can be half so\r\neffective as the shell of rock twenty miles or more in thickness,\r\nwhich secures the heated interior of the earth from rapid loss by\r\nradiation into space. Even were the earth's surface solid copper or\r\nsolid silver, both most admirable conductors of heat, the cooling down\r\nof this vast globe would be an extremely tardy process; how much more\r\ntardy must it therefore be when such exceedingly bad conductors as\r\nrocks form the envelope? How imperfectly material of this kind will\r\ntransmit heat is strikingly illustrated by the great blast iron\r\nfurnaces which are so vitally important in one of England's greatest\r\nmanufacturing industries. A glowing mass of coal and iron ore and\r\nlimestone is here urged to vivid incandescence by a blast of air\r\nitself heated to an intense temperature. The mighty heat thus\r\ngenerated--sufficient as it is to detach the iron from its close\r\nalliance with the earthy materials and to render the metal out as a\r\npure stream rushing white-hot from the vent--is sufficiently confined\r\nby a few feet of brick-work, one side of which is therefore at the\r\ntemperature of molten iron, while the other is at a temperature not\r\nmuch exceeding that of the air. We may liken the brick-work of a blast\r\nfurnace to the rocky covering of the earth; in each case an\r\nexceedingly high temperature on one side is compatible with a very\r\nmoderate temperature on the other.\r\n\r\nAlthough the drainage of heat away from the earth's interior to its\r\nsurface, and its loss there by radiation into space, is an extremely\r\ntardy process, yet it is incessantly going on. We have here again to\r\nnote the ability for gigantic effect which a small but continually\r\noperating cause may have, provided it always tends in the same\r\ndirection. The earth is incessantly losing heat; and though in a day,\r\na week, or a year the loss may not be very significant, yet when we\r\ncome to deal with periods of time that have to be reckoned by millions\r\nof years, it may well be that the effect of a small loss of heat per\r\nannum can, in the course of these ages, reach unimagined dimensions.\r\nSuppose, for instance, that the earth experienced a fall of\r\ntemperature in its interior which amounted to only one-thousandth of a\r\ndegree in a year. So minute a quantity as this is imperceptible. Even\r\nin a century, the loss of heat at this rate would be only the tenth of\r\na degree. There would be no possible way of detecting it; the most\r\ncareful thermometer could not be relied on to tell us for a certainty\r\nthat the temperature of the hot waters of Bath had declined the tenth\r\nof a degree; and I need hardly say, that the fall of a tenth of a\r\ndegree would signify nothing in the lavas of Vesuvius, nor influence\r\nthe thunders of Krakatoa by one appreciable note. So far as a human\r\nlife or the life of the human race is concerned, the decline of a\r\ntenth of a degree per century in the earth's internal heat is\r\nabsolutely void of significance. I cannot, however, impress upon you\r\ntoo strongly, that the mere few thousands of years with which human\r\nhistory is cognizant are an inappreciable moment in comparison with\r\nthose unmeasured millions of years which geology opens out to us, or\r\nwith those far more majestic periods which the astronomer demands for\r\nthe events he has to describe.\r\n\r\nAn annual loss of even one-thousandth of a degree will be capable of\r\nstupendous achievements when supposed to operate during epochs of\r\ngeological magnitude. In fact, its effects would be so vast, that it\r\nseems hardly credible that the present loss of heat from the earth\r\nshould be so great as to amount to an abatement of one-thousandth of a\r\ndegree per annum, for that would mean, that in a thousand years the\r\nearth's temperature would decline by one degree, and in a million\r\nyears the decline would amount to a thousand degrees. At all events,\r\nthe illustration may suffice to show, that the fact that we are not\r\nable to prove by our instruments that the earth is cooling is no\r\nargument whatever against the inevitable law, that the earth, like\r\nevery other heated body, must be tending towards a lower temperature.\r\n\r\nWithout pretending to any numerical accuracy, we can at all events\r\ngive a qualitative if not a quantitative analysis of the past history of\r\nour earth, in so far as its changes of temperature are concerned. A\r\nmillion years ago our earth doubtless contained appreciably more heat\r\nthan it does at present. I speak not now, of course, of mere solar\r\nheat--of the heat which gives us the vicissitudes of seasons; I am\r\nonly referring to the original hoard of internal heat which is\r\ngradually waning. As therefore our retrospect extends through\r\nmillions and millions of past ages, we see our earth ever growing\r\nwarmer and warmer the further and further we look back. There was a\r\ntime when those heated strata which we have now to go deep down in\r\nmines to find were considerably nearer the surface. At present, were\r\nit not for the sun, the heat of the earth where we stand would hardly\r\nbe appreciably above the temperature of infinite space--perhaps some\r\n200 or 300 degrees below zero. But there must have been a time when\r\nthere was sufficient internal heat to maintain the exterior at a warm\r\nand indeed at a very hot temperature. Nor is there any bound to our\r\nretrospect arising from the operation or intervention of any other\r\nagent, so far as we know; consequently the hotter and the hotter grows\r\nthe surface the further and the further we look back. Nor can we stop\r\nuntil, at an antiquity so great that I do not venture on any estimate\r\nof the date, we discover that this earth must have consisted of\r\nglowing hot material. Further and further we can look back, and we see\r\nthe rocks--or whatever other term we choose to apply to the then\r\ningredients of the earth's crust--in a white-hot and even in a molten\r\ncondition. Thus our argument has led us to the belief that time was\r\nwhen this now solid globe of ours was a ball of white-hot fluid.\r\n\r\nOn the argument which I have here used there are just two remarks\r\nwhich I particularly wish to make. Note in the first place, that our\r\nreasoning is founded on the fact that the earth is at present, to some\r\nextent, heated. It matters not whether this heat be much or little;\r\nour argument would have been equally valid had the earth only\r\ncontained a single particle of its mass at a somewhat higher\r\ntemperature than the temperature of space. I am, of course, not\r\nalluding in this to heat which can be generated by combustion. The\r\nother point to which I refer is to remove an objection which may\r\npossibly be urged against this line of reasoning. I have argued that\r\nbecause the temperature is continually increasing as we look\r\nbackwards, that therefore a very great temperature must once have\r\nprevailed. Without some explanation this argument is not logically\r\ncomplete. There is, it is well known, the old paradox of the geometric\r\nseries; you may add a farthing to a halfpenny, and then a\r\nhalf-farthing, and then a quarter-farthing, and then the eighth of a\r\nfarthing, followed by the sixteenth, and thirty-second, and so on,\r\nhalving the contribution each time. Now no matter how long you\r\ncontinue this process, even if you went on with it for ever, and thus\r\nmade an infinite number of contributions, you would never accomplish\r\nthe task of raising the original halfpenny to the dignity of a penny.\r\nAn infinite number of quantities may therefore, as this illustration\r\nshows, never succeed in attaining any considerable dimensions. Our\r\nargument, however, with regard to the increase of heat as we look back\r\nis the very opposite of this. It is the essence of a cooling body to\r\nlose heat more rapidly in proportion as its temperature is greater.\r\nThus though the one-thousandth of a degree may be all the fall of\r\ntemperature that our earth now experiences in a twelvemonth, yet in\r\nthose glowing days when the surface was heated to incandescence, the\r\nloss of heat per annum must have been immensely greater than it is\r\nnow. It therefore follows that the rate of gain of the earth's heat as\r\nwe look back must be of a different character to that of the geometric\r\nseries which I have just illustrated; for each addition to the\r\nearth's heat, as we look back from year to year, must grow greater and\r\ngreater, and therefore there is here no shelter for a fallacy in the\r\nargument on which the existence of high temperature of primeval times\r\nis founded.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning that I have applied to our earth may be applied in\r\nalmost similar words to the moon. It is true that we have not any\r\nknowledge of the internal nature of the moon at present, nor are we\r\nable to point to any active volcanic phenomena at present in progress\r\nthere in support of the contention that the moon either has now\r\ninternal heat, or did once possess it. It is, however, impossible to\r\ndeny the evidence which the lunar craters afford as to the past\r\nexistence of volcanic activity on our satellite. Heat, therefore,\r\nthere was once in the moon; and accordingly we are enabled to conclude\r\nthat, on a retrospect through illimitable periods of time, we must\r\nfind the moon transformed from that cold and inert body she now seems\r\nto a glowing and incandescent mass of molten material. The earth\r\ntherefore and the moon in some remote ages--not alone anterior to the\r\nexistence of life, but anterior even to the earliest periods of which\r\ngeologists have cognizance--must have been both globes of molten\r\nmaterials which have consolidated into the rocks of the present epoch.\r\n\r\nWe must now revert to the tidal history of the earth-moon system. Did\r\nwe not show that there was a time when the earth and the moon--or\r\nperhaps, I should say, the ingredients of the earth and moon--were\r\nclose together, were indeed in actual contact? We have now learned,\r\nfrom a wholly different line of reasoning, that in very early ages\r\nboth bodies were highly heated. Here as elsewhere in this theory we\r\ncan make little or no attempt to give any chronology, or to harmonize\r\nthe different lines along which the course of history has run. No one\r\ncan form the slightest idea as to what the temperature of the earth\r\nand of the moon must have been in those primeval ages when they were\r\nin contact. It is impossible, however, to deny that they must both\r\nhave been in a very highly heated state; and everything we know of the\r\nmatter inclines us to the belief that the temperature of the\r\nearth-moon system must at this critical epoch have been one of\r\nglowing incandescence and fusion. It is therefore quite possible that\r\nthese bodies--the moon especially--may have then been not at all of\r\nthe form we see them now. It has been supposed, and there are some\r\ngrounds for the supposition, that at this initial stage of earth-moon\r\nhistory the moon materials did not form a globe, but were disposed in\r\na ring which surrounded the earth, the ring being in a condition of\r\nrapid rotation. It was at a subsequent period, according to this view,\r\nthat the substances in the ring gradually drew together, and then by\r\ntheir mutual attractions formed a globe which ultimately consolidated\r\ndown into the compact moon as we now see it. I must, however,\r\nspecially draw your attention to the clearly-marked line which divides\r\nthe facts which dynamics have taught us from those notions which are\r\nto be regarded as more or less conjectural. Interpreting the action of\r\nthe tides by the principles of dynamics, we are assured that the moon\r\nwas once--or rather the materials of the moon--in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the earth. There, however, dynamics leaves us, and\r\nunfortunately withholds its accurate illumination from the events\r\nwhich immediately preceded that state of things.\r\n\r\nThe theory of tidal evolution which I am describing in these lectures\r\nis mainly the work of Professor George H. Darwin of Cambridge. Much of\r\nthe original parts of the theory of the tides was due to Sir William\r\nThomson, and I have also mentioned how Professor Purser contributed an\r\nimportant element to the dynamical theory. It is, however, Darwin who\r\nhas persistently deduced from the theory all the various consequences\r\nwhich can be legitimately drawn from it. Darwin, for instance, pointed\r\nout that as the moon is receding from us, it must, if we only look far\r\nenough back, have been once in practical contact with the earth. It is\r\nto Darwin also that we owe many of the other parts of a fascinating\r\ntheory, either in its mathematical or astronomical aspect; but I must\r\ntake this opportunity of saying, that I do not propose to make\r\nProfessor Darwin or any of the other mathematicians I have named\r\nresponsible for all that I shall say in these lectures. I must be\r\nmyself accountable for the way in which the subject is being treated,\r\nas well as for many of the illustrations used, and some of the\r\ndeductions I have drawn from the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is almost unavoidable for us to make a surmise as to the cause by\r\nwhich the moon had come into this remarkable position close to the\r\nearth at the most critical epoch of earth-moon history.\r\n\r\nWith reference to this Professor Darwin has offered an explanation,\r\nwhich seems so exceedingly plausible that it is impossible to resist\r\nthe notion that it must be correct. I will ask you to think of the\r\nearth not as a solid body covered largely with ocean, but as a glowing\r\nglobe of molten material. In a globe of this kind it is possible for\r\ngreat undulations to be set up. Here is a large vase of water, and by\r\ndisplacing it I can cause the water to undulate with a period which\r\ndepends on the size of the vessel; undulations can be set up in a\r\nbucket of water, the period of these undulations being dependent upon\r\nthe dimensions of the bucket. Similarly in a vast globe of molten\r\nmaterial certain undulations could be set up, and those undulations\r\nwould have a period depending upon the dimensions of this vibrating\r\nmass. We may conjecture a mode in which such vibrations could be\r\noriginated. Imagine a thin shell of rigid material which just encases\r\nthe globe; suppose this be divided into four quarters, like the four\r\nquarters of an orange, and that two of these opposite quarters be\r\nrejected, leaving two quarters on the liquid. Now suppose that these\r\ntwo quarters be suddenly pressed in, and then be as suddenly\r\nremoved--they will produce depressions, of course, on the two opposite\r\nquarters, while the uncompressed quarters will become protuberant. In\r\nvirtue of the mutual attractions between the different particles of\r\nthe mass, an effort will be made to restore the globular form, but\r\nthis will of course rather overshoot the mark; and therefore a series\r\nof undulations will be originated by which two opposite quarters of\r\nthe sphere will alternately shrink in and become protuberant. There\r\nwill be a particular period to this oscillation. For our globe it\r\nwould appear to be somewhere about an hour and a half or two hours;\r\nbut there is necessarily a good deal of uncertainty about this point.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how in those primitive days the earth was spinning around\r\nvery rapidly; and I have also stated that the earth might at this\r\nvery critical epoch of its history be compared with a grindstone\r\nwhich is being driven so rapidly that it is on the very brink of\r\nrupture. It is remarkable to note, that a cause tending to precipitate\r\na rupture of the earth was at hand. The sun then raised tides in the\r\nearth as it does at present. When the earth revolved in a period of\r\nsome four hours or thereabouts, the high tides caused by the sun\r\nsucceeded each other at intervals of about two hours. When I speak of\r\ntides in this respect, of course I am not alluding to oceanic tides;\r\nthese were the days long before ocean existed, at least in the liquid\r\nform. The tides I am speaking about were raised in the fluids and\r\nmaterials which then constituted the whole of the glowing earth; those\r\ntides rose and fell under the throb produced by the sun, just as truly\r\nas tides produced in an ordinary ocean. But now note the significant\r\ncoincidence between the period of the throb produced by the sun-raised\r\ntides, and that natural period of vibration which belonged to our\r\nearth as a mass of molten material. It therefore follows, that the\r\nimpulse given to the earth by the sun harmonized in time with that\r\nperiod in which the earth itself was disposed to oscillate. A\r\nwell-known dynamical principle here comes into play. You see a heavy\r\nweight hanging by a string, and in my hand I hold a little slip of\r\nwood no heavier than a common pencil; ordinarily speaking, I might\r\nstrike that heavy weight with this slip of wood, and no effect is\r\nproduced; but if I take care to time the little blows that I give so\r\nthat they shall harmonize with the vibrations which the weight is\r\nnaturally disposed to make, then the effect of many small blows will\r\nbe cumulative, so much so, that after a short time the weight begins\r\nto respond to my efforts, and now you see it has acquired a swing of\r\nvery considerable amplitude. In Professor Fitzgerald's address to the\r\nBritish Association at Bath last autumn, he gives an account of those\r\nastounding experiments of Hertz, in which well-timed electrical\r\nimpulses broke down an air resistance, and revealed to us ethereal\r\nvibrations which could never have been made manifest except by the\r\nprinciple we are here discussing. The ingenious conjecture has been\r\nmade, that when the earth was thrown into tidal vibrations in those\r\nprimeval days, these slight vibrations, harmonizing as they did with\r\nthe natural period of the earth, gradually acquired amplitude; the\r\nresult being that the pulse of each successive vibration increased at\r\nlast to such an extent that the earth separated under the stress, and\r\nthrew off a portion of those semi-fluid materials of which it was\r\ncomposed. In process of time these rejected portions contracted\r\ntogether, and ultimately formed that moon we now see. Such is the\r\norigin of the moon which the modern theory of tidal evolution has\r\npresented to our notice.\r\n\r\nThere are two great epochs in the evolution of the earth-moon\r\nsystem--two critical epochs which possess a unique dynamical\r\nsignificance; one of these periods was early in the beginning, while\r\nthe other cannot arrive for countless ages yet to come. I am aware\r\nthat in discussing this matter I am entering somewhat largely into\r\nmathematical principles; I must only endeavour to state the matter as\r\nsuccinctly as the subject will admit.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier part of this lecture I have explained how, during all\r\nthe development of the earth-moon system, the quantity of moment of\r\nmomentum remains unaltered. The moment of momentum of the earth's\r\nrotation added to the moment of momentum of the moon's revolution\r\nremains constant; if one of these quantities increase the other must\r\ndecrease, and the progress of the evolution will have this result,\r\nthat energy shall be gradually lost in consequence of the friction\r\nproduced by the tides. The investigation is one appropriate for\r\nmathematical formulæ, such as those that can be found in Professor\r\nDarwin's memoirs; but nature has in this instance dealt kindly with\r\nus, for she has enabled an abstruse mathematical principle to be dealt\r\nwith in a singularly clear and concise manner. We want to obtain a\r\ndefinite view of the alteration in the energy of the system which\r\nshall correspond to a small change in the velocity of the earth's\r\nrotation, the moon of course accommodating itself so that the moment\r\nof momentum shall be preserved unaltered. We can use for this purpose\r\nan angular velocity which represents the excess of the earth's\r\nrotation over the angular revolution of the moon; it is, in fact, the\r\napparent angular velocity with which the moon appears to move round\r\nthe heavens. If we represent by N the angular velocity of the earth,\r\nand by M the angular velocity of the moon in its orbit round the\r\nearth, the quantity we desire to express is N--M; we shall call it the\r\nrelative rotation. The mathematical theorem which tells us what we\r\nwant can be enunciated in a concise manner as follows. _The alteration\r\nof the energy of the system may be expressed by multiplying the\r\nrelative rotation by the change in the earth's angular velocity._ This\r\nresult will explain many points to us in the theory, but just at\r\npresent I am only going to make a single inference from it.\r\n\r\nI must advert for a moment to the familiar conception of a maximum or\r\na minimum. If a magnitude be increasing, that is, gradually growing\r\ngreater and greater, it has obviously not attained a maximum so long\r\nas the growth is in progress. Nor if the object be actually decreasing\r\ncan it be said to be at a maximum either; for then it was greater a\r\nsecond ago than it is now, and therefore it cannot be at a maximum at\r\npresent. We may illustrate this by the familiar example of a stone\r\nthrown up into the air; at first it gradually rises, being higher at\r\neach instant than it was previously, until a culminating point is\r\nreached, when just for a moment the stone is poised at the summit of\r\nits path ere it commences its return to earth again. In this case the\r\nmaximum point is obtained when the stone, having ceased to ascend, and\r\nnot having yet commenced to descend, is momentarily at rest.\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply to the determination of a minimum. As long\r\nas the magnitude is declining the minimum has not been reached; it is\r\nonly when the decline has ceased, and an increase is on the point of\r\nsetting in, that the minimum can be said to be touched.\r\n\r\nThe earth-moon system contains at any moment a certain store of\r\nenergy, and to every conceivable condition of the earth-moon system a\r\ncertain quantity of energy is appropriate. It is instructive for us to\r\nstudy the different positions in which the earth and the moon might\r\nlie, and to examine the different quantities of energy which the\r\nsystem will contain in each of those varied positions. It is however\r\nto be understood that the different cases all presuppose the same\r\ntotal moment of momentum.\r\n\r\nAmong the different cases that can be imagined, those will be of\r\nspecial interest in which the total quantity of energy in the system\r\nis a maximum or a minimum. We must for this purpose suppose the system\r\ngradually to run through all conceivable changes, with the earth and\r\nmoon as near as possible, and as far as possible, and in all\r\nintermediate positions; we must also attribute to the earth every\r\nvariety in the velocity of its rotation which is compatible with the\r\npreservation of the moment of momentum. Beginning then with the\r\nearth's velocity of rotation at its lowest, we may suppose it\r\ngradually and continually increased, and, as we have already seen, the\r\nchange in the energy of the system is to be expressed by multiplying\r\nthe relative rotation into the change of the earth's angular velocity.\r\nIt follows from the principles we have already explained, that the\r\nmaximum or minimum energy is attained at the moment when the\r\nalteration is zero. It therefore follows, that the critical periods of\r\nthe system will arise when the relative rotation is zero, that is,\r\nwhen the earth's rotation on its axis is performed with a velocity\r\nequal to that with which the moon revolves around the earth. This is\r\ntruly a singular condition of the earth-moon system; the moon in such\r\na case would revolve around the earth as if the two bodies were bound\r\ntogether by rigid bonds into what was practically a single solid body.\r\nAt the present moment no doubt to some extent this condition is\r\nrealized, because the moon always turns the same face to the earth (a\r\npoint on which we shall have something to say later on); but in the\r\noriginal condition of the earth-moon system, the earth would also\r\nconstantly direct the same face to the moon, a condition of things\r\nwhich is now very far from being realized.\r\n\r\nIt can be shown from the mathematical nature of the problem that there\r\nare four states of the earth-moon system in which this condition may\r\nbe realized, and which are also compatible with the conservation of\r\nthe moment of momentum. We can express what this condition implies in\r\na somewhat more simple manner. Let us understand by the _day_ the\r\nperiod of the earth's rotation on its axis, whatever that may be, and\r\nlet us understand by the _month_ the period of revolution of the moon\r\naround the earth, whatever value it may have; then the condition of\r\nmaximum or minimum energy is attained when the day and the month have\r\nbecome equal to each other. Of the four occasions mathematically\r\npossible in which the day and the month can be equal, there are only\r\ntwo which at present need engage our attention--one of these occurred\r\nnear the beginning of the earth and moon's history, the other remains\r\nto be approached in the immeasurably remote future. The two remaining\r\nsolutions are futile, being what the mathematician would describe as\r\nimaginary.\r\n\r\nThere is a fundamental difference between the dynamical conditions in\r\nthese critical epochs--in one of them the energy of the system has\r\nattained a maximum value, and in the other the energy of the system is\r\nat a minimum value. It is impossible to over-estimate the significance\r\nof these two states of the system.\r\n\r\nI may recall the fundamental notion which every one has learned in\r\nmechanics, as to the difference between stable and unstable\r\nequilibrium. The conceivable possibility of making an egg stand on its\r\nend is a practical impossibility, because nature does not like\r\nunstable equilibrium, and a body departs therefrom on the least\r\ndisturbance; on the other hand, stable equilibrium is the position in\r\nwhich nature tends to place everything. A log of wood floating on a\r\nriver might conceivably float in a vertical position with its end up\r\nout of the water, but you never could succeed in so balancing it,\r\nbecause no matter how carefully you adjusted the log, it would almost\r\ninstantly turn over when you left it free; on the other hand, when the\r\nlog floats naturally on the water it assumes a horizontal position, to\r\nwhich, when momentarily displaced therefrom, it will return if\r\npermitted to do so. We have here an illustration of the contrast\r\nbetween stable and unstable equilibrium. It will be found generally\r\nthat a body is in equilibrium when its centre of gravity is at its\r\nhighest point or at its lowest point; there is, however, this\r\nimportant difference, that when the centre of gravity is highest the\r\nequilibrium is unstable, and when the centre of gravity is lowest the\r\nequilibrium is stable. The potential energy of an egg poised on its\r\nend in unstable equilibrium is greater than when it lies on its side\r\nin stable equilibrium. In fact, energy must be expended to raise the\r\negg from the horizontal position to the vertical; while, on the other\r\nhand, work could conceivably be done by the egg when it passes from\r\nthe vertical position to the horizontal. Speaking generally, we may\r\nsay that the stable position indicates low energy, while a redundancy\r\nof that valuable agent is suggestive of instability.\r\n\r\nWe may apply similar principles to the consideration of the earth-moon\r\nsystem. It is true that we have here a series of dynamical phenomena,\r\nwhile the illustrations I have given of stable and unstable\r\nequilibrium relate only to statical problems; but we can have\r\ndynamical stability and dynamical instability, just as we can have\r\nstable and unstable equilibrium. Dynamical instability corresponds\r\nwith the maximum of energy, and dynamical stability to the minimum of\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nAt that primitive epoch, when the energy of the earth-moon system was\r\na maximum, the condition was one of dynamical instability; it was\r\nimpossible that it should last. But now mark how truly critical an\r\noccurrence this must have been in the history of the earth-moon\r\nsystem, for have I not already explained that it is a necessary\r\ncondition of the progress of tidal evolution that the energy of the\r\nsystem should be always declining? But here our retrospect has\r\nconducted us back to a most eventful crisis, in which the energy was a\r\nmaximum, and therefore cannot have been immediately preceded by a\r\nstate in which the energy was greater still; it is therefore\r\nimpossible for the tidal evolution to have produced this state of\r\nthings; some other influence must have been in operation at this\r\nbeginning of the earth-moon system.\r\n\r\nThus there can be hardly a doubt that immediately preceding the\r\ncritical epoch the moon originated from the earth in the way we have\r\ndescribed. Note also that this condition, being one of maximum energy,\r\nwas necessarily of dynamical instability, it could not last; the moon\r\nmust adopt either of two courses--it must tumble back on the earth, or\r\nit must start outwards. Now which course was the moon to adopt? The\r\ncase is analogous to that of an egg standing on its end--it will\r\ninevitably tumble one way or the other. Some infinitesimal cause will\r\nproduce a tendency towards one side, and to that side accordingly the\r\negg will fall. The earth-moon system was similarly in an unstable\r\nstate, an infinitesimal cause might conceivably decide the fate of the\r\nsystem. We are necessarily in ignorance of what the determining cause\r\nmight have been, but the effect it produced is perfectly clear; the\r\nmoon did not again return to its mother earth, but set out on that\r\nmighty career which is in progress to-day.\r\n\r\nLet it be noted that these critical epochs in the earth-moon history\r\narise when and only when there is an absolute identity between the\r\nlength of the month and the length of the day. It may be proper\r\ntherefore that I should provide a demonstration of the fact, that the\r\nidentity between these two periods must necessarily have occurred at a\r\nvery early period in the evolution.\r\n\r\nThe law of Kepler, which asserts that the square of the periodic time\r\nis proportioned to the cube of the mean distance, is in its ordinary\r\napplication confined to a comparison between the revolutions of the\r\nseveral planets about the sun. The periodic time of each planet is\r\nconnected with its average distance by this law; but there is another\r\napplication of Kepler's law which gives us information of the distance\r\nand the period of the moon in former stages of the earth-moon history.\r\nAlthough the actual path of the moon is of course an ellipse, yet that\r\nellipse is troubled, as is well known, by many disturbing forces, and\r\nfrom this cause alone the actual path of the moon is far from being\r\nany of those simple curves with which we are so well acquainted. Even\r\nwere the earth and the moon absolutely rigid particles, perturbations\r\nwould work all sorts of small changes in the pliant curve. The\r\nphenomena of tidal evolution impart an additional element of\r\ncomplexity into the actual shape of the moon's path. We now see that\r\nthe ellipse is not merely subject to incessant deflections of a\r\nperiodic nature, it also undergoes a gradual contraction as we look\r\nback through time past; but we may, with all needful accuracy for our\r\npresent purpose, think of the path of the moon as a circle, only we\r\nmust attribute to that circle a continuous contraction of its radius\r\nthe further and the further we look back. The alteration in the\r\nradius will be even so slow, that the moon will accomplish thousands\r\nof revolutions around the earth without any appreciable alteration in\r\nthe average distance of the two bodies. We can therefore think of the\r\nmoon as revolving at every epoch in a circle of special radius, and as\r\naccomplishing that revolution in a special time. With this\r\nunderstanding we can now apply Kepler's law to the several stages of\r\nthe moon's past history. The periodic time of each revolution, and the\r\nmean distance at which that revolution was performed, will be always\r\nconnected together by the formula of Kepler. Thus to take an instance\r\nin the very remote past. Let us suppose that the moon was at one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand miles instead of two hundred and forty\r\nthousand, that is, at half its present distance. Applying the law of\r\nKepler, we see that the time of revolution must then have been only\r\nabout ten days instead of the twenty-seven it is now. Still further,\r\nlet us suppose that the moon revolves in an orbit with one-tenth of\r\nthe diameter it has at present, then the cube of 10 being 1000, and\r\nthe square root of 1000 being 31.6, it follows that the month must\r\nhave been less than the thirty-first part of what it is at present,\r\nthat is, it must have been considerably less than one of our present\r\ndays. Thus you see the month is growing shorter and shorter the\r\nfurther we look back, the day is also growing shorter and shorter; but\r\nstill I think we can show that there must have been a time when the\r\nmonth will have been at least as short as the day. For let us take the\r\nmost extreme case in which the moon shall have made the closest\r\npossible approximation to the earth. Two globes in contact will have a\r\ndistance between their centres which is equal to the sum of their\r\nradii. Take the earth as having a radius of four thousand miles, and\r\nthe moon a radius of one thousand miles, the two centres must at their\r\nshortest distance be five thousand miles apart, that is, the moon must\r\nthen be at the forty-eighth part of its present distance from the\r\nearth. Now the cube of 48 is 110,592, and the square root of 110,592\r\nis nearly 333, therefore the length of the month will be one-three\r\nhundred and thirty-third part of the duration of the month at present;\r\nin other words, the moon must revolve around the earth in a period of\r\nsomewhat about two hours. It seems impossible that the day can ever\r\nhave been as brief as this. We have therefore proved that, in the\r\ncourse of its contracting duration, the moon must have overtaken the\r\ncontracting day, and that therefore there must have been a time when\r\nthe moon was in the vicinity of the earth, and having a day and month\r\nof equal period. Thus we have shown that the critical condition of\r\ndynamical instability must have occurred in the early period of the\r\nearth-moon history, if the agents then in operation were those which\r\nwe now know. The further development of the subject must be postponed\r\nuntil the next lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE II.\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting from that fitting commencement of earth-moon history which\r\nthe critical epoch affords, we shall now describe the dynamical\r\nphenomena as the tidal evolution progressed. The moon and the earth\r\ninitially moved as a solid body, each bending the same face towards\r\nthe other; but as the moon retreated, and as tides began to be raised\r\non the earth, the length of the day began to increase, as did also the\r\nlength of the month. We know, however, that the month increased more\r\nrapidly than the day, so that a time was reached when the month was\r\ntwice as long as the day; and still both periods kept on increasing,\r\nbut not at equal rates, for in progress of time the month grew so much\r\nmore rapidly than the day, that many days had to elapse while the moon\r\naccomplished a single revolution. It is, however, only necessary for\r\nus to note those stages of the mighty progress which correspond to\r\nspecial events. The first of such stages was attained when the month\r\nassumed its maximum ratio to the day. At this time, the month was\r\nabout twenty-nine days, and the epoch appears to have occurred at a\r\ncomparatively recent date if we use such standards of time as tidal\r\nevolution requires; though measured by historical standards, the epoch\r\nis of incalculable antiquity. I cannot impress upon you too often the\r\nenormous magnitude of the period of time which these phenomena have\r\nrequired for their evolution. Professor Darwin's theory affords but\r\nlittle information on this point, and the utmost we can do is to\r\nassign a minor limit to the period through which tidal evolution has\r\nbeen in progress. It is certain that the birth of the moon must have\r\noccurred at least fifty million years ago, but probably the true\r\nperiod is enormously greater than this. If indeed we choose to add a\r\ncipher or two to the figure just printed, I do not think there is\r\nanything which could tell us that we have over-estimated the mark.\r\nTherefore, when I speak of the epoch in which the month possessed the\r\ngreatest number of days as a recent one, it must be understood that I\r\nam merely speaking of events in relation to the order of tidal\r\nevolution. Viewed from this standpoint, we can show that the epoch is\r\na recent one in the following manner. At present the month consists of\r\na little more than twenty-seven days, but at this maximum period to\r\nwhich I have referred the month was about twenty-nine days; from that\r\nit began to decline, and the decline cannot have proceeded very far,\r\nfor even still there are only two days less in the month than at the\r\ntime when the month had the greatest number of days. It thus follows\r\nthat the present epoch--the human epoch, as we may call it--in the\r\nhistory of the earth has fallen at a time when the progress of tidal\r\nevolution is about half-way between the initial and the final stage. I\r\ndo not mean half-way in the sense of actual measurement of years;\r\nindeed, from this point it would seem that we cannot yet be nearly\r\nhalf-way, for, vast as are the periods of time that have elapsed since\r\nthe moon first took its departure from the earth, they fall far short\r\nof that awful period of time which will intervene between the present\r\nmoment and the hour when the next critical state of earth-moon\r\nhistory shall have been attained. In that state the day is destined\r\nonce again to be equal to the month, just as was the case in the\r\ninitial stage. The half-way stage will therefore in one sense be that\r\nin which the proportion of the month to the day culminates. This is\r\nthe stage which we have but lately passed; and thus it is that at\r\npresent we may be said to be almost half-way through the progress of\r\ntidal evolution.\r\n\r\nMy narrative of the earth-moon evolution must from this point forward\r\ncease to be retrospective. Having begun at that critical moment when\r\nthe month and day were first equal, we have traced the progress of\r\nevents to the present hour. What we have now to say is therefore a\r\nforecast of events yet to come. So far as we can tell, no agent is\r\nlikely to interfere with the gradual evolution caused by the tides,\r\nwhich dynamical principles have disclosed to us. As the years roll on,\r\nor perhaps, I should rather say, as thousands of years and millions of\r\nyears roll on, the day will continue to elongate, or the earth to\r\nrotate more slowly on its axis. But countless ages must elapse before\r\nanother critical stage of the history shall be reached. It is needless\r\nfor me to ponder over the tedious process by which this interesting\r\nepoch is reached. I shall rather sketch what the actual condition of\r\nour system will be when that moment shall have arrived. The day will\r\nthen have expanded from the present familiar twenty-four hours up to a\r\nday more than twice, more than five, even more than fifty times its\r\npresent duration. In round numbers, we may say that this great day\r\nwill occupy one thousand four hundred of our ordinary hours. To\r\nrealize the critical nature of the situation then arrived at, we must\r\nfollow the corresponding evolution through which the moon passes. From\r\nits present distance of two hundred and forty thousand miles, the moon\r\nwill describe an ever-enlarging orbit; and as it does so the duration\r\nof the month will also increase, until at last a point will be reached\r\nwhen the month has become more than double its present length, and has\r\nattained the particular value of one thousand four hundred hours. We\r\nare specially to observe that this one-thousand four-hundred-hour\r\nmonth will be exactly reached when the day has also expanded to one\r\nthousand four hundred hours; and the essence of this critical\r\ncondition, which may be regarded as a significant point of tidal\r\nevolution, is that the day and the month have again become equal. The\r\nday and the month were equal at the beginning, the day and the month\r\nwill be equal at the end. Yet how wide is the difference between the\r\nbeginning and the end. The day or the month at the end is some\r\nhundreds of times as long as the month or the day at the beginning.\r\n\r\nI have already fully explained how, in any stage of the evolutionary\r\nprogress in which the day and the month became equal, the energy of\r\nthe system attained a maximum or a minimum value. At the beginning the\r\nenergy was a maximum; at the end the energy will be a minimum. The\r\nmost important consequences follow from this consideration. I have\r\nalready shown that a condition of maximum energy corresponded to\r\ndynamic instability. Thus we saw that the earth-moon history could not\r\nhave commenced without the intervention of some influence other than\r\ntides at the beginning. Now let us learn what the similar doctrine\r\nhas to tell us with regard to the end. The condition then arrived at\r\nis one of dynamical stability; for suppose that the system were to\r\nreceive a slight alteration, by which the moon went out a little\r\nfurther, and thus described a larger orbit, and so performed more than\r\nits share of the moment of spin. Then the earth would have to do a\r\nlittle less spinning, because, under all circumstances, the total\r\nquantity of spin must be preserved unaltered. But the energy being at\r\na minimum, such a small displacement must of course produce a state of\r\nthings in which the energy would be increased. Or if we conceived the\r\nmoon to come in towards the earth, the moon would then contribute less\r\nto the total moment of momentum. It would therefore be incumbent on\r\nthe earth to do more; and accordingly the velocity of the earth's\r\nrotation would be augmented. But this arrangement also could only be\r\nproduced by the addition of some fresh energy to the system, because\r\nthe position from which the system is supposed to have been disturbed\r\nis one of minimum energy.\r\n\r\nNo disturbance of the system from this final position is therefore\r\nconceivable, unless some energy can be communicated to it. But this\r\nwill demonstrate the utter incompetency of the tides to shift the\r\nsystem by a hair's breadth from this position; for it is of the\r\nessence of the tides to waste energy by friction. And the\r\ntransformations of the system which the tides have caused are\r\ninvariably characterized by a decline of energy, the movements being\r\notherwise arranged so that the total moment of momentum shall be\r\npreserved intact. Note, how far we were justified in speaking of this\r\ncondition as a final one. It is final so far as the lunar tides are\r\nconcerned; and were the system to be screened from all outer\r\ninterference, this accommodation between the earth and the moon would\r\nbe eternal.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed another way of demonstrating that a condition of the\r\nsystem in which the day has assumed equality with the month must\r\nnecessarily be one of dynamical equilibrium. We have shown that the\r\nenergy which the tides demand is derived not from the mere fact that\r\nthere are high tides and low tides, but from the circumstance that\r\nthese tides do rise and fall; that in falling and rising they do\r\nproduce currents; and it is these currents which generate the friction\r\nby which the earth's velocity is slowly abated, its energy wasted, and\r\nno doubt ultimately dissipated as heat. If therefore we can make the\r\nebbing and the flowing of the tides to cease, then our argument will\r\ndisappear. Thus suppose, for the sake of illustration, that at a\r\nmoment when the tides happened to be at high water in the Thames, such\r\na change took place in the behaviour of the moon that the water always\r\nremained full in the Thames, and at every other spot on the earth\r\nremained fixed at the exact height which it possessed at this\r\nparticular moment. There would be no more tidal friction, and\r\ntherefore the system would cease to course through that series of\r\nchanges which the existence of tidal friction necessitates.\r\n\r\nBut if the tide is always to be full in the Thames, then the moon must\r\nbe always in the same position with respect to the meridian, that is,\r\nthe moon must always be fixed in the heavens over London. In fact, the\r\nmoon must then revolve around the earth just as fast as London\r\ndoes--the month must have the same length as the day. The earth must\r\nthen show the same face constantly to the moon, just as the moon\r\nalways does show the same face towards the earth; the two globes will\r\nin fact revolve as if they were connected with invisible bonds, which\r\nunited them into a single rigid body.\r\n\r\nWe need therefore feel no surprise at the cessation of the progress of\r\ntidal evolution when the month and the day are equal, for then the\r\nmovement of moon-raised tides has ceased. No doubt the same may be\r\nsaid of the state at the beginning of the history, when the day and\r\nthe month had the brief and equal duration of a few hours. While the\r\nequality of the two periods lasted there could be no tides, and\r\ntherefore no progress in the direction of tidal evolution. There is,\r\nhowever, the profound difference of stability and instability between\r\nthe two cases; the most insignificant disturbance of the system at the\r\ninitial stage was sufficient to precipitate the revolving moon from\r\nits condition of dynamical equilibrium, and to start the course of\r\ntidal evolution in full vigour. If, however, any trifling derangement\r\nshould take place in the last condition of the system, so that the\r\nmonth and the day departed slightly from equality, there would\r\ninstantly be an ebbing and a flowing of the tides; and the friction\r\ngenerated by these tides would operate to restore the equality because\r\nthis condition is one of dynamical stability.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen with what justice we can look forward to the day\r\nand month each of fourteen hundred hours as a finale to the progress\r\nof the luni-tidal evolution. Throughout the whole of this marvellous\r\nseries of changes it is always necessary to remember the one constant\r\nand invariable element--the moment of momentum of the system which\r\ntides cannot alter. Whatever else the friction can have done, however\r\nfearful may have been the loss of energy by the system, the moment of\r\nmomentum which the system had at the beginning it preserves unto the\r\nend. This it is which chiefly gives us the numerical data on which we\r\nhave to rely for the quantitative features of tidal evolution.\r\n\r\nWe have made so many demands in the course of these lectures on the\r\ncapacity of tidal friction to accomplish startling phenomena in the\r\nevolution of the earth-moon system, that it is well for us to seek for\r\nany evidence that may otherwise be obtainable as to the capacity of\r\ntides for the accomplishment of gigantic operations. I do not say\r\nthat there is any doubt which requires to be dispelled by such\r\nevidence, for as to the general outlines of the doctrine of tidal\r\nevolution which has been here sketched out there can be no reasonable\r\nground for mistrust; but nevertheless it is always desirable to widen\r\nour comprehension of any natural phenomena by observing collateral\r\nfacts. Now there is one branch of tidal action to which I have as yet\r\nonly in the most incidental way referred. We have been speaking of the\r\ntides in the earth which are made to ebb and flow by the action of the\r\nmoon; we have now to consider the tides in the moon, which are there\r\nexcited by the action of the earth. For between these two bodies there\r\nis a reciprocity of tidal-making energy--each of them is competent to\r\nraise tides in the other. As the moon is so small in comparison with\r\nthe earth, and as the tides on the moon are of but little significance\r\nin the progress of tidal evolution, it has been permissible for us to\r\nomit them from our former discussion. But it is these tides on the\r\nmoon which will afford us a striking illustration of the competency of\r\ntides for stupendous tasks. The moon presents a monument to show what\r\ntides are able to accomplish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--The Moon.]\r\n\r\nI must first, however, explain a difficulty which is almost sure to\r\nsuggest itself when we speak of tides on the moon. I shall be told\r\nthat the moon contains no water on its surface, and how then, it will\r\nbe said, can tides ebb and flow where there is no sea to be disturbed?\r\nThere are two answers to this difficulty; it is no doubt true that the\r\nmoon seems at present entirely devoid of water in so far as its\r\nsurface is exposed to us, but it is by no means certain that the moon\r\nwas always in this destitute condition. There are very large features\r\nmarked on its map as \"seas\"; these regions are of a darker hue than\r\nthe rest of the moon's surface, they are large objects often many\r\nhundreds of miles in diameter, and they form, in fact, those dark\r\npatches on the brilliant surface which are conspicuous to the unaided\r\neye, and are represented in Fig. 3. Viewed in a telescope these\r\nso-called seas, while clearly possessing no water at the present time,\r\nare yet widely different from the general aspect of the moon's\r\nsurface. It has often been supposed that great oceans once filled\r\nthese basins, and a plausible explanation has even been offered as to\r\nhow the waters they once contained could have vanished. It has been\r\nthought that as the mineral substances deep in the interior of our\r\nsatellite assumed the crystalline form during the progress of cooling,\r\nthe demand for water of crystallization required for incorporation\r\nwith the minerals was so great that the oceans of the moon became\r\nentirely absorbed. It is, however, unnecessary for our present\r\nargument that this theory should be correct. Even if there never was a\r\ndrop of water found on our satellite, the tides in its molten\r\nmaterials would be quite sufficient for our purpose; anything that\r\ntides could accomplish would be done more speedily by vast tides of\r\nflowing lava than by merely oceanic tides.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that tides raised on the moon by the earth would\r\nbe greater than the tides raised on the earth by the moon. The\r\nquestion is, however, not a very simple one, for it depends on the\r\nmasses of both bodies as well as on their relative dimensions. In so\r\nfar as the masses are concerned, the earth being more than eighty\r\ntimes as heavy as the moon, the tides would on this account be vastly\r\nlarger on the moon than on the earth. On the other hand, the moon's\r\ndiameter being much less than that of the earth, the efficiency of a\r\ntide-producing body in its action on the moon would be less than that\r\nof the same body at the same distance in its action on the earth; but\r\nthe diminution of the tides from this cause would be not so great as\r\ntheir increase from the former cause, and therefore the net result\r\nwould be to exhibit much greater tides on the moon than on the earth.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the moon had been originally endowed with a rapid\r\nmovement of rotation around its axis, the effect of the tides on that\r\nrotation would tend to check its velocity just in the same way as the\r\ntides on the earth have effected a continual elongation of the day.\r\nOnly as the tides on the moon were so enormously great, their capacity\r\nto check the moon's speed would have corresponding efficacy. In\r\naddition to this, the mass of the moon being so small, it could only\r\noffer feeble resistance to the unceasing action of the tide, and\r\ntherefore our satellite must succumb to whatever the tides desired\r\nages before our earth would have been affected to a like extent. It\r\nmust be noticed that the influence of the tidal friction is not\r\ndirected to the total annihilation of the rotation of the two bodies\r\naffected by it; the velocity is only checked down until it attains\r\nsuch a point that the speed in which each body rotates upon its axis\r\nhas become equal to that in which it revolves around the\r\ntide-producer. The practical effect of such an adjustment is to make\r\nthe tide-agitated body turn a constant face towards its tormentor.\r\n\r\nI may here note a point about which people sometimes find a little\r\ndifficulty. The moon constantly turns the same face towards the earth,\r\nand therefore people are sometimes apt to think that the moon performs\r\nno rotation whatever around its own axis. But this is indeed not the\r\ncase. The true inference to be drawn from the constant face of the\r\nmoon is, that the velocity of rotation about its own axis is equal to\r\nthat of its rotation around the earth; in fact, the moon revolves\r\naround the earth in twenty-seven days, and its rotation about its axis\r\nis performed in twenty-seven days also. You may illustrate the\r\nmovement of the moon around the earth by walking around a table in a\r\nroom, keeping all the time your face turned towards the table; in such\r\na case as this you not only perform a motion of revolution, but you\r\nalso perform a rotation in an equal period. The proof that you do\r\nrotate is to be found in the fact that during the movement your face\r\nis being directed successively to all the points of the compass. There\r\nis no more singular fact in the solar system than the constancy of the\r\nmoon's face to the earth. The periods of rotation and revolution are\r\nboth alike; if one of these periods exceeded the other by an amount so\r\nsmall as the hundredth part of a second, the moon would in the lapse\r\nof ages permit us to see that other side which is now so jealously\r\nconcealed. The marvellous coincidence between these two periods would\r\nbe absolutely inexplicable, unless we were able to assign it to some\r\nphysical cause. It must be remembered that in this matter the moon\r\noccupies a unique position among the heavenly host. The sun revolves\r\naround on its axis in a period of twenty-five or twenty-six days--thus\r\nwe see one side of the sun as frequently as we see the other. The side\r\nof the sun which is turned towards us to-day is almost entirely\r\ndifferent from that we saw a fortnight ago. Nor is the period of the\r\nsun's rotation to be identified with any other remarkable period in\r\nour system. If it were equal to the length of the year, for instance,\r\nor if it were equal to the period of any of the other planets, then it\r\ncould hardly be contended that the phenomenon as presented by the moon\r\nwas unique; but the sun's period is not simply related, or indeed\r\nrelated at all, to any of the other periodic times in the system. Nor\r\ndo we find anything like the moon's constancy of face in the behaviour\r\nof the other planets. Jupiter turns now one face to us and then\r\nanother. Nor is his rotation related to the sun or related to any\r\nother body, as our moon's motion is related to us. It has indeed been\r\nthought that in the movements of the satellites of Jupiter a somewhat\r\nsimilar phenomenon may be observed to that in the motion of our own\r\nsatellite. If this be so, the causes whereby this phenomenon is\r\nproduced are doubtless identical in the two cases.\r\n\r\nSo remarkable a coincidence as that which the moon's motion shows\r\ncould not reasonably be explained as a mere fortuitous circumstance;\r\nnor need we hesitate to admit that a physical explanation is required\r\nwhen we find a most satisfactory one ready for our acceptance, as was\r\noriginally pointed out by Helmholtz.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever that the constancy of the moon's face\r\nis the work of ancient tides, which have long since ceased to act. We\r\nhave shown that if the moon's rotation had once been too rapid to\r\npermit of the same face being always directed towards us, the tides\r\nwould operate as a check by which the velocity of that rotation would\r\nbe abated. On the other hand, if the moon rotated so slowly that its\r\nother face would be exposed to us in the course of the revolution, the\r\ntides would then be dragged violently over its surface in the\r\ndirection of its rotation; their tendency would thus be to accelerate\r\nthe speed until the angular velocity of rotation was equal to that of\r\nrevolution. Thus the tides would act as a controlling agent of the\r\nutmost stringency to hurry the moon round when it was not turning fast\r\nenough, and to arrest the motion when going too fast. Peace there\r\nwould be none for the moon until it yielded absolute compliance to the\r\ntyranny of the tides, and adjusted its period of rotation with exact\r\nidentity to its period of revolution. Doubtless this adjustment was\r\nmade countless ages ago, and since that period the tides have acted so\r\nas to preserve the adjustment, as long as any part of the moon was in\r\na state sufficiently soft or fluid to respond to tidal impression. The\r\npresent state of the moon is a monument to which we may confidently\r\nappeal in support of our contention as to the great power of the tides\r\nduring the ages which have passed; it will serve as an illustration of\r\nthe future which is reserved for our earth in ages yet to come, when\r\nour globe shall have also succumbed to tidal influence.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to the smallness of the moon relatively to the earth that\r\nthe tidal process has reached a much more advanced stage in the moon\r\nthan it has on the earth; but the moon is incessant in its efforts to\r\nbring the earth into the same condition which it has itself been\r\nforced to assume. Thus again we look forward to an epoch in the\r\ninconceivably remote future when tidal thraldom shall be supreme, and\r\nwhen the earth shall turn the same face to the moon, as the moon now\r\nturns the same face to the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the critical state of things thus looming in the dim future, the\r\nearth and the moon will continue to perform this adjusted revolution\r\nin a period of about fourteen hundred hours, the two bodies being\r\nheld, as it were, by invisible bands. Such an arrangement might be\r\neternal if there were no intrusion of tidal influence from any other\r\nbody; but of course in our system as we actually find it the sun\r\nproduces tides as well as the moon; and the solar tides being at\r\npresent much less than those originated by the moon, we have neglected\r\nthem in the general outlines of the theory. The solar tides, however,\r\nmust necessarily have an increasing significance. I do not mean that\r\nthey will intrinsically increase, for there seems no reason to\r\napprehend any growth in their actual amount; it is their relative\r\nimportance to the lunar tides that is the augmenting quantity. As the\r\nfinal state is being approached, and as the velocity of the earth's\r\nrotation is approximating to the angular velocity with which the moon\r\nrevolves around it, the ebbing and the flowing of the lunar tides must\r\nbecome of evanescent importance; and this indeed for a double reason,\r\npartly on account of the moon's greatly augmented distance, and\r\npartly on account of the increasing length of the lunar day, and the\r\nextremely tardy movements of ebb and flow that the lunar tides will\r\nthen have. Thus the lunar tides, so far as their dynamical importance\r\nis concerned, will ultimately become zero, while the solar tides\r\nretain all their pristine efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore to examine the dynamical effects of solar tides on\r\nthe earth and moon in the critical stage to which the present course\r\nof things tends. The earth will then rotate in a period of about\r\nfifty-seven of its present days; and considering that the length of\r\nthe day, though so much greater than our present day, is still much\r\nless than the year, it follows that the solar tides must still\r\ncontinue so as to bring the earth's velocity of rotation to a point\r\neven lower than it has yet attained. In fact, if we could venture to\r\nproject our glance sufficiently far into the future, it would seem\r\nthat the earth must ultimately have its velocity checked by the\r\nsun-raised tides, until the day itself had become equal to the year.\r\nThe dynamical considerations become, however, too complex for us to\r\nfollow them, so that I shall be content with merely pointing out that\r\nthe influence of the solar tides will prevent the earth and moon from\r\neternally preserving the relations of bending the same face towards\r\neach other; the earth's motion will, in fact, be so far checked, that\r\nthe day will become _longer_ than the month.\r\n\r\nThus the doctrine of tidal evolution has conducted us to a prospect of\r\na condition of things which will some time be reached, when the moon\r\nwill have receded to a distance in which the month shall have become\r\nabout fifty-seven days, and when the earth around which this moon\r\nrevolves shall actually require a still longer period to accomplish\r\nits rotation on its axis. Here is an odd condition for a planet with\r\nits satellite; indeed, until a dozen years ago it would have been\r\npronounced inconceivable that a moon should whirl round a planet so\r\nquickly that its journey was accomplished in less than one of the\r\nplanet's own days. Arguments might be found to show that this was\r\nimpossible, or at least unprecedented. There is our own moon, which\r\nnow takes twenty-seven days to go round the earth; there is Jupiter,\r\nwith four moons, and the nearest of these to the primary goes round\r\nin forty-two and a half hours. No doubt this is a very rapid motion;\r\nbut all those matters are much more lively with Jupiter than they are\r\nhere. The giant planet himself does not need ten hours for a single\r\nrotation, so that you see his nearest moon still takes between two and\r\nthree Jovian days to accomplish a single revolution. The example of\r\nSaturn might have been cited to show that the quickest revolution that\r\nany satellite could perform must still require at least twice as long\r\nas the day in which the planet performed its rotation. Nor could the\r\nrotation of the planets around the sun afford a case which could be\r\ncited. For even Mercury, the nearest of all the planets to the sun of\r\nwhich the existence is certainly known, and therefore the most rapid\r\nin its revolution, requires eighty-eight days to get round once; and\r\nin the mean time the sun has had time to accomplish between three and\r\nfour rotations. Indeed, the analogies would seem to have shown so\r\ngreat an improbability in the conclusion towards which tidal evolution\r\npoints, that they would have contributed a serious obstacle to the\r\ngeneral acceptance of that theory.\r\n\r\nBut in 1877 an event took place so interesting in astronomical\r\nhistory, that we have to look back to the memorable discovery of\r\nUranus in 1781 before we can find a parallel to it in importance. Mars\r\nhad always been looked upon as one of the moonless planets, though\r\ngrounds were not wanting for the surmise that probably moons to Mars\r\nreally existed. It was under the influence of this belief that an\r\nattempt was made by Professor Asaph Hall at Washington to make a\r\ndetermined search, and see if Mars might not be attended by satellites\r\nlarge enough to be discoverable. The circumstances under which this\r\nmemorable inquiry was undertaken were eminently favourable for its\r\nsuccess. The orbit of Mars is one which possesses an exceptionally\r\nhigh eccentricity; it consequently happens that the oppositions during\r\nwhich the planet is to be observed vary very greatly in the facilities\r\nthey afford for a search like that contemplated by Professor Hall. It\r\nis obviously advantageous that the planet should be situated as near\r\nas possible to the earth, and in the opposition in 1877 the distance\r\nwas almost at the lowest point it is capable of attaining; but this\r\nwas not the only point in which Professor Hall was favoured; he had\r\nthe use of a telescope of magnificent proportions and of consummate\r\noptical perfection. His observatory was also placed in Washington, so\r\nthat he had the advantage of a pure sky and of a much lower latitude\r\nthan any observatory in Great Britain is placed at. But the most\r\nconspicuous advantage of all was the practised skill of the astronomer\r\nhimself, without which all these other advantages would have been but\r\nof little avail. Great success rewarded his well-designed efforts; not\r\nalone was one satellite discovered which revolved around the planet in\r\na period conformable with that of other similar cases, but a second\r\nlittle satellite was found, which accomplished its revolution in a\r\nwholly unexpected and unprecedented manner. The day of Mars himself,\r\nthat is, the period in which he can accomplish a rotation around his\r\naxis, very closely approximates to our own day, being in fact half an\r\nhour longer. This little satellite, the inner and more rapid of the\r\npair, requires for a single revolution a period of only seven hours\r\nthirty-nine minutes, that is to say, the little body scampers more\r\nthan three times round its primary before the primary itself has\r\nfinished one of its leisurely rotations. Here was indeed a striking\r\nfact, a unique fact in our system, which riveted the attention of\r\nastronomers on this most beautiful discovery.\r\n\r\nYou will now see the bearing which the movement of the inner satellite\r\nof Mars has on the doctrine of tidal evolution. As a legitimate\r\nconsequence of that doctrine, we came to the conclusion that our\r\nearth-moon system must ultimately attain a condition in which the day\r\nis longer than the month. But this conclusion stood unsupported by any\r\nanalogous facts in the more anciently-known truths of astronomy. The\r\nmovement of the satellite of Mars, however, affords the precise\r\nillustration we want; and this fact, I think, adds an additional\r\nsignificance to the interest and the beauty of Professor Hall's\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nIt is of particular interest to investigate the possible connection\r\nwhich the phenomena of tidal evolution may have had in connection with\r\nthe geological phenomena of the earth. We have already pointed out the\r\ngreater closeness of the moon to us in times past. The tides raised by\r\nthe moon on the earth must therefore have been greater in past ages\r\nthan they are now, for of course the nearer the moon the bigger the\r\ntide. As soon as the earth and the moon had separated to a\r\nconsiderable distance we may say that the height of the tide will vary\r\ninversely as the cube of the moon's distance; it will therefore\r\nhappen, that when the moon was at half its present distance from us,\r\nhis tide-producing capacity was not alone twice as much or four times\r\nas much, but even eight times as much as it is at present; and a much\r\ngreater rate of tidal rise and fall indicates, of course, a\r\npreponderance in every other manifestation of tidal activity. The\r\ntidal currents, for instance, must have been much greater in volume\r\nand in speed; even now there are places in which the tidal currents\r\nflow at four or more miles per hour. We can imagine, therefore, the\r\nvehemence of the tidal currents which must have flowed in those days\r\nwhen the moon was a much smaller distance from us. It is interesting\r\nto view these considerations in their possible bearings on geological\r\nphenomena. It is true that we have here many elements of uncertainty,\r\nbut there is, however, a certain general outline of facts which may\r\nbe laid down, and which appears to be instructive, with reference to\r\nthe past history of our earth.\r\n\r\nI have all through these lectures indicated a mighty system of\r\nchronology for the earth-moon system. It is true that we cannot give\r\nour chronology any accurate expression in years. The various stages of\r\nthis history are to be represented by the successive distances between\r\nthe earth and the moon. Each successive epoch, for instance, may be\r\nmarked by the number of thousands of miles which separate the moon\r\nfrom the earth.\r\n\r\nBut we have another system of chronology derived from a wholly\r\ndifferent system of ideas; it too relates to periods of vast duration,\r\nand, like our great tidal periods, extends to times anterior to human\r\nhistory, or even to the duration of human life on this globe. The\r\nfacts of geology open up to us a majestic chronology, the epochs of\r\nwhich are familiar to us by the succession of strata forming the crust\r\nof the earth, and by the succession of living beings whose remains\r\nthese strata have preserved. From the present or recent age our\r\nretrospect over geological chronology leads us to look through a\r\nvista embracing periods of time overwhelming in their duration, until\r\nat last our view becomes lost, and our imagination is baffled in the\r\neffort to comprehend the formation of those vast stratified rocks, a\r\ndozen miles or more in thickness, which seem to lie at the very base\r\nof the stratified system on the earth, and in which it would appear\r\nthat the dawnings of life on this globe may be almost discerned. We\r\nhave thus the two systems of chronology to compare--one, the\r\nastronomical chronology measured by the successive stages in the\r\ngradual retreat of the moon; the other, the geological chronology\r\nmeasured by the successive strata constituting the earth's crust.\r\nNever was a more noble problem proposed in the physical history of our\r\nearth than that which is implied in the attempt to correlate these two\r\nsystems of chronology. What we would especially desire to know is the\r\nmoon's distance which corresponds to each of the successive strata on\r\nthe earth. How far off, for instance, was that moon which looked down\r\non the coal forests in the time of their greatest luxuriance? or what\r\nwas the apparent size of the full moon at which the ichthyosaurus\r\ncould have peeped when he turned that wonderful eye of his to the sky\r\non a fine evening? But interesting as this great problem is, it lies,\r\nalas! outside the possibility of exact solution. Indeed we shall not\r\nmake any attempt which must necessarily be futile to correlate these\r\nchronologies; all we can do is to state the one fact which is\r\nabsolutely undeniable in the matter.\r\n\r\nLet us fix our attention on that specially interesting epoch at the\r\ndawn of geological time, when those mighty Laurentian rocks were\r\ndeposited of which the thickness is so astounding, and let us consider\r\nwhat the distance of the moon must have been at this initial epoch of\r\nthe earth's history. All we know for certain is, that the moon must\r\nhave been nearer, but what proportion that distance bore to the\r\npresent distance is necessarily quite uncertain. Some years ago I\r\ndelivered a lecture at Birmingham, entitled \"A Glimpse through the\r\nCorridors of Time,\" and in that lecture I threw out the suggestion\r\nthat the moon at this primeval epoch may have only been at a small\r\nfraction of its present distance from us, and that consequently\r\nterrific tides may in these days have ravaged the coast. There was a\r\ngood deal of discussion on the subject, and while it was universally\r\nadmitted that the tides must have been larger in palæozoic times than\r\nthey are at present, yet there was a considerable body of opinion to\r\nthe effect that the tides even then may have been only about twice, or\r\npossibly not so much, greater than those tides we have at the present.\r\nWhat the actual fact may be we have no way of knowing; but it is\r\ninteresting to note that even the smallest accession to the tides\r\nwould be a valuable factor in the performance of geological work.\r\n\r\nFor let me recall to your minds a few of the fundamental phenomena of\r\ngeology. Those stratified rocks with which we are now concerned have\r\nbeen chiefly manufactured by deposition of sediment in the ocean.\r\nRivers, swollen, it may be, by floods, and turbid with a quantity of\r\nmaterial held in suspension, discharge their waters into the sea.\r\nGranting time and quiet, this sediment falls to the bottom; successive\r\nadditions are made to its thickness during centuries and thousands of\r\nyears, and thus beds are formed which in the course of ages\r\nconsolidate into actual rock. In the formation of such beds the tides\r\nwill play a part. Into the estuaries at the mouths of rivers the tides\r\nhurry in and hurry out, and especially during spring tides there are\r\ncurrents which flow with tremendous power; then too, as the waves\r\nbatter against the coast they gradually wear away and crumble down the\r\nmightiest cliffs, and waft the sand and mud thus produced to augment\r\nthat which has been brought down by the rivers. In this operation also\r\nthe tides play a part of conspicuous importance, and where the ebb and\r\nflow is greatest it is obvious that an additional impetus will be\r\ngiven to the manufacture of stratified rocks. In fact, we may regard\r\nthe waters of the globe as a mighty mill, incessantly occupied in\r\ngrinding up materials for future strata. The main operating power of\r\nthis mill is of course derived from the sun, for it is the sun which\r\nbrings up the rains to nourish the rivers, it is the sun which raises\r\nthe wind which lashes the waves against the shore. But there is an\r\nauxiliary power to keep the mill in motion, and that auxiliary power\r\nis afforded by the tides. If then we find that by any cause the\r\nefficiency of the tides is increased we shall find that the mill for\r\nthe manufacture of strata obtains a corresponding accession to its\r\ncapacity. Assuming the estimate of Professor Darwin, that the tide may\r\nhave had twice as great a vertical range of ebb and flow within\r\ngeological times as it has at present, we find a considerable addition\r\nto the efficiency of the ocean in the manufacture of the ancient\r\nstratified rocks. It must be remembered that the extent of the area\r\nthrough which the tides will submerge and lay bare the country, will\r\noften be increased more than twofold by a twofold increase of height.\r\nA little illustration may show what I mean. Suppose a cone to be\r\nfilled with water up to a certain height, and that the quantity of\r\nwater in it be measured; now let the cone be filled until the water is\r\nat double the depth; then the surfaces of the water in the two cases\r\nwill be in the ratio of the circles, one of which has double the\r\ndiameter of the other. The areas of the two surfaces are thus as four\r\nto one; the volumes of the waters in the two cases will be in the\r\nproportion of two similar solids, the ratios of their dimensions being\r\nas two to one. Of course this means that the water in the one case\r\nwould be eight times as much as in the other. This particular\r\nillustration will not often apply exactly to tidal phenomena, but I\r\nmay mention one place that I happen to know of, in the vicinity of\r\nDublin, in which the effect of the rise and fall of the tide would be\r\nsomewhat of this description. At Malahide there is a wide shallow\r\nestuary cut off from the sea by a railway embankment, and there is a\r\nviaduct in the embankment through which a great tidal current flows in\r\nand out alternately. At low tide there is but little water in this\r\nestuary, but at high tide it extends for miles inland. We may regard\r\nthis inlet with sufficient approximation to the truth as half of a\r\ncone with a very large angle, the railway embankment of course forming\r\nthe diameter; hence it follows that if the tide was to be raised to\r\ndouble its height, so large an area of additional land would be\r\nsubmerged, and so vast an increase of water would be necessary for the\r\npurpose, that the flow under the railway bridge would have to be much\r\nmore considerable than it is at present. In some degree the same\r\nphenomena will be repeated elsewhere around the coast. Simply\r\nmultiplying the height of the tide by two would often mean that the\r\nborder of land between high and low water would be increased more than\r\ntwofold, and that the volume of water alternately poured on the land\r\nand drawn off it would be increased in a still larger proportion. The\r\nvelocity of all tidal currents would also be greater than at present,\r\nand as the power of a current of water for transporting solid material\r\nheld in suspension increases rapidly with the velocity, so we may\r\ninfer that the efficiency of tidal currents as a vehicle for the\r\ntransport of comminuted rocks would be greatly increased. It is thus\r\nobvious that tides with a rise and fall double in vertical height of\r\nthose which we know at present would add a large increase to their\r\nefficiency as geological agents. Indeed, even were the tides only half\r\nor one-third greater than those we know now, we might reasonably\r\nexpect that the manufacture of stratified rocks must have proceeded\r\nmore rapidly than at present.\r\n\r\nThe question then will assume this form. We know that the tides must\r\nhave been greater in Cambrian or Laurentian days than they are at\r\npresent; so that they were available as a means of assisting other\r\nagents in the stupendous operations of strata manufacture which were\r\nthen conducted. This certainly helps us to understand how these\r\ntremendous beds of strata, a dozen miles or more in solid thickness,\r\nwere deposited. It seems imperative that for the accomplishment of a\r\ntask so mighty, some agents more potent than those with which we are\r\nfamiliar should be required. The doctrine of tidal evolution has shown\r\nus what those agents were. It only leaves us uninformed as to the\r\ndegree in which their mighty capabilities were drawn upon.\r\n\r\nIt is the property of science as it grows to find its branches more\r\nand more interwoven, and this seems especially true of the two\r\ngreatest of all natural sciences--geology and astronomy. With the\r\nbeginnings of our earth as a globe in the shape in which we find it\r\nboth these sciences are directly concerned. I have here touched upon\r\nanother branch in which they illustrate and confirm each other.\r\n\r\nAs the theory of tidal evolution has shed such a flood of light into\r\nthe previously dark history of our earth-moon system, it becomes of\r\ninterest to see whether the tidal phenomena may not have a wider\r\nscope; whether they may not, for instance, have determined the\r\nformation of the planets by birth from the sun, just as the moon seems\r\nto have originated by birth from the earth. Our first presumption,\r\nthat the cases are analogous, is not however justified when the facts\r\nare carefully inquired into. A principle which I have not hitherto\r\ndiscussed here assumes prominence, and therefore we shall devote our\r\nattention to it for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nLet us understand what we mean by the solar system. There is first the\r\nsun at the centre, which preponderates over all the other bodies so\r\nenormously, as shown in Fig. 4, in which the earth and the sun are\r\nplaced side by side for comparison. There is then the retinue of\r\nplanets, among the smaller of which our earth takes its place, a view\r\nof the comparative sizes of the planets being shown in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Comparative sizes of Earth and Sun.]\r\n\r\nNot to embarrass ourselves with the perplexities of a problem so\r\ncomplicated as our solar system is in its entirety, we shall for the\r\nsake of clear reasoning assume an ideal system, consisting of a sun\r\nand a large planet--in fact, such as our own system would be if we\r\ncould withdraw from it all other bodies, leaving the sun and Jupiter\r\nonly remaining. We shall suppose, of course, that the sun is much\r\nlarger than the planet, in fact, it will be convenient to keep in mind\r\nthe relative masses of the sun and Jupiter, the weight of the planet\r\nbeing less than one-thousandth part of the sun. We know, of course,\r\nthat both of those bodies are rotating upon their axes, and the one\r\nis revolving around the other; and for simplicity we may further\r\nsuppose that the axes of rotation are perpendicular to the plane of\r\nrevolution. In bodies so constituted tides will be manifested.\r\nJupiter will raise tides in the sun, the sun will raise tides in\r\nJupiter. If the rotation of each body be performed in a less period\r\nthan that of the revolution (the case which alone concerns us), then\r\nthe tides will immediately operate in their habitual manner as a brake\r\nfor the checking of rotation. The tides raised by the sun on Jupiter\r\nwill tend therefore to lengthen Jupiter's day; the tides raised on the\r\nsun by Jupiter will tend to augment the sun's period of rotation. Both\r\nJupiter and the sun will therefore lose some moment of momentum. We\r\ncannot, however, repeat too often the dynamical truth that the total\r\nmoment of momentum must remain constant, therefore what is lost by the\r\nrotation must be made up in the revolution; the orbit of Jupiter\r\naround the sun must accordingly be swelling. So far the reasoning\r\nappears similar to that which led to such startling consequences in\r\nregard to the moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Comparative sizes of Planets.]\r\n\r\nBut now for the fundamental difference between the two cases. The\r\nmoon, it will be remembered, always revolves with the same face\r\ntowards the earth. The tides have ceased to operate there, and\r\nconsequently the moon is not able to contribute any moment of\r\nmomentum, to be applied to the enlargement of its distance from the\r\nearth; all the moment of momentum necessary for this purpose is of\r\ncourse drawn from the single supply in the rotation of the earth on\r\nits axis. But in the case of the system consisting of the sun and\r\nJupiter the circumstances are quite different--Jupiter does not always\r\nbend the same face to the sun; so far, indeed, is this from being\r\ntrue, that Jupiter is eminently remarkable for the rapidity of his\r\nrotation, and for the incessantly varying aspect in which he would be\r\nseen from the sun. Jupiter has therefore a store of available moment\r\nof momentum, as has also of course the sun. Thus in the sun and planet\r\nsystem we have in the rotations two available stores of moment of\r\nmomentum on which the tides can make draughts for application to the\r\nenlargement of the revolution. The proportions in which these two\r\navailable sources can be drawn upon for contributions is not left\r\narbitrary. The laws of dynamics provide the shares in which each of\r\nthe bodies is to contribute for the joint purpose of driving them\r\nfurther apart.\r\n\r\nLet us see if we cannot form an estimate by elementary considerations\r\nas to the division of the labour. The tides raised on Jupiter by the\r\nsun will be practically proportional to the sun's mass and to the\r\nradius of Jupiter. Owing to the enormous size of the sun, the\r\nefficiency of these tides and the moment of the friction-brake they\r\nproduce will be far greater on the planet than will the converse\r\noperation of the planet be on the sun. Hence it follows that the\r\nefficiency of the tides in depriving Jupiter of moment of momentum\r\nwill be greatly superior to the efficiency of the tides in depriving\r\nthe sun of moment of momentum. Without following the matter into any\r\nclose numerical calculation, we may assert that for every one part the\r\nsun contributes to the common object, Jupiter will contribute at least\r\na thousand parts; and this inequality appears all the more striking,\r\nnot to say unjust, when it is remembered that the sun is more\r\nabundantly provided with moment of momentum than is Jupiter--the sun\r\nhas, in fact, about twenty thousand times as much.\r\n\r\nThe case may be illustrated by supposing that a rich man and a poor\r\nman combine together to achieve some common purpose to which both are\r\nto contribute. The ethical notion that Dives shall contribute\r\nlargely, according to his large means, and Lazarus according to his\r\nslender means, is quite antagonistic to the scale which dynamics has\r\nimposed. Dynamics declares that the rich man need only give a penny to\r\nevery pound that has to be extorted from the poor man. Now this is\r\nprecisely the case with regard to the sun and Jupiter, and it involves\r\na somewhat curious consequence. As long as Jupiter possesses available\r\nmoment of momentum, we may be certain that no large contribution of\r\nmoment of momentum has been obtained from the sun. For, returning to\r\nour illustration, if we find that Lazarus still has something left in\r\nhis pocket, we are of course assured that Dives cannot have expended\r\nmuch, because, as Lazarus had but little to begin with, and as Dives\r\nonly puts in a penny for every pound that Lazarus spends, it is\r\nobvious that no large amount can have been devoted to the common\r\nobject. Hence it follows that whatever transfer of moment of momentum\r\nhas taken place in the sun-Jupiter system has been almost entirely\r\nobtained at the expense of Jupiter. Now in the solar system at\r\npresent, the orbital moment of momentum of Jupiter is nearly fifty\r\nthousand times as great as his present store of rotational moment of\r\nmomentum. If, therefore, the departure of Jupiter from the sun had\r\nbeen the consequence of tidal evolution, it would follow that Jupiter\r\nmust once have contained many thousands of times the moment of\r\nmomentum that he has at present. This seems utterly incredible, for\r\neven were Jupiter dilated into an enormously large mass of vaporous\r\nmatter, spinning round with the utmost conceivable speed, it is\r\nimpossible that he should ever have possessed enough moment of\r\nmomentum. We are therefore forced to the conclusion that the tides\r\nalone do not provide sufficient explanation for the retreat of Jupiter\r\nfrom the sun.\r\n\r\nThere is rather a subtle point in the considerations now brought\r\nforward, on which it will be necessary for us to ponder. In the\r\nillustration of Dives and Lazarus, the contributions of Lazarus of\r\ncourse ceased when his pockets were exhausted, but those of Dives will\r\ncontinue, and in the lapse of time may attain any amount within the\r\nutmost limits of Dives' resources. The essential point to notice is,\r\nthat so long as Lazarus retains anything in _his_ pocket, we know for\r\ncertain that Dives has not given much; if Lazarus, however, has his\r\npocket absolutely empty, and if we do not know how long they may have\r\nbeen in that condition, we have no means of knowing how large a\r\nportion of wealth Dives may not have actually expended. The\r\nturning-point of the theory thus involves the fact that Jupiter still\r\nretains available moment of momentum in his rotation; and this was our\r\nsole method of proving that the sun, which in this case was Dives, had\r\nnever given much. But our argument must have taken an entirely\r\ndifferent line had it so happened that Jupiter constantly turned the\r\nsame face to the sun, and that therefore his pockets were entirely\r\nempty in so far as available moment of momentum is concerned. It would\r\nbe apparently impossible for us to say to what extent the resources of\r\nthe sun may not have been drawn upon; we can, however, calculate\r\nwhether in any case the sun could possibly have supplied enough moment\r\nof momentum to account for the recession of Jupiter. Speaking in round\r\nnumbers, the revolutional moment of momentum of Jupiter is about\r\nthirty times as great as the rotational moment of momentum at present\r\npossessed by the sun. I do not know that there is anything impossible\r\nin the supposition that the sun might, by an augmented volume and an\r\naugmented velocity of rotation, contain many times the moment of\r\nmomentum that it has at this moment. It therefore follows that if it\r\nhad happened that Jupiter constantly bent the same face to the sun,\r\nthere would apparently be nothing impossible in the fact that Jupiter\r\nhad been born of the sun, just as the moon was born of the earth.\r\nThese same considerations should also lead us to observe with still\r\nmore special attention the development of the earth-moon system. Let\r\nus restate the matter of the earth and moon in the light which the\r\nargument with respect to Jupiter has given us. At present the\r\nrotational moment of momentum of the earth is about a fifth part of\r\nthe revolutional moment of momentum of the moon. Owing to the fact\r\nthat the moon keeps the same face to us, she has now no available\r\nmoment of momentum, and all the moment of momentum required to account\r\nfor her retreat has of late come from the rotation of the earth; but\r\nsuppose that the moon still had some liquid on its surface which could\r\nbe agitated by tides, suppose further that it did not always bend the\r\nsame face towards us, that it therefore had some available moment of\r\nmomentum due to its rotation on which the tides could operate, then\r\nsee how the argument would have been altered. The gradual increase of\r\nthe moon's distance could be provided for by a transfer of moment of\r\nmomentum from two sources, due of course to the rotational velocities\r\nof the two bodies. Here again the moon and the earth will contribute\r\naccording to that dynamical but very iniquitous principle which\r\nregulated the appropriations from the purses of Dives and Lazarus. The\r\nmoon must give not according to her abundance, but in the inverse\r\nratio thereof--because she has little she must give largely. Nor shall\r\nwe make an erroneous estimate if we say that nine-tenths of the whole\r\nmoment of momentum necessary for the enlargement of the orbit would\r\nhave been exacted from the moon; that means that the moon must once\r\nhave had about five or six times as much moment of momentum as the\r\nearth possesses at this moment. Considering the small size of the\r\nmoon, this could only have arisen by terrific velocity of rotation,\r\nwhich it is inconceivable that its materials could ever have\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nThis presents the demonstration of tidal evolution in a fresh light.\r\nIf the moon now departed to any considerable extent from showing the\r\nconstant face to the earth, it would seem that its retreat could not\r\nhave been caused by tides. Some other agent for producing the present\r\nconfiguration would be necessary, just as we found that some other\r\nagent than the tides has been necessary in the case of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nBut I must say a few words as to the attitude of this question with\r\nregard to the entire solar system. This system consists of the sun\r\npresiding at the centre, and of the planets and their satellites in\r\nrevolution around their respective primaries, and each also animated\r\nby a rotation on its axis. I shall in so far depart from the actual\r\nconfiguration of the system as to transform it into an ideal system,\r\nwhereof the masses, the dimensions, and the velocities shall all be\r\npreserved; but that the several planes of revolution shall be all\r\nflattened into one plane, instead of being inclined at small angles as\r\nthey are at present; nor will it be unreasonable for us at the same\r\ntime to bring into parallelism all the axes of rotation, and to\r\narrange that their common directions shall be perpendicular to the\r\nplane of their common orbits. For the purpose of our present research\r\nthis ideal system may pass for the real system.\r\n\r\nIn its original state, whatever that state may have been, a\r\nmagnificent endowment was conferred upon the system. Perhaps I may,\r\nwithout derogation from the dignity of my subject, speak of the\r\nendowment as partly personal and partly entailed. The system had of\r\ncourse different powers with regard to the disposal of the two\r\nportions; the personal estate could be squandered. It consisted\r\nentirely of what we call energy; and considering how frequently we use\r\nthe expression conservation of energy, it may seem strange to say now\r\nthat this portion of the endowment has been found capable of\r\nalienation, nay, further, that our system has been squandering it\r\npersistently from the first moment until now. Although the doctrine of\r\nthe conservation of energy is, we have every reason to believe, a\r\nfundamental law affecting the whole universe, yet it would be wholly\r\ninaccurate to say that any particular system such as our solar system\r\nshall invariably preserve precisely the same quantity of energy\r\nwithout alteration. The circumstance that heat is a form of energy\r\nindeed negatives this supposition. For our system possesses energy of\r\nall the different kinds: there is energy due to the motions both of\r\nrotation and of revolution; there is energy due to the fact that the\r\nmutually attracting bodies of our system are separated by distances of\r\nenormous magnitude; and there is also energy in the form of heat; and\r\nthe laws of heat permit that this form of energy shall be radiated off\r\ninto space, and thus disappear entirely, in so far as our system is\r\nconcerned. On the other hand, there may no doubt be some small amount\r\nof energy accruing to our system from the other systems in space,\r\nwhich like ours are radiating forth energy. Any gain from this source,\r\nhowever, is necessarily so very small in comparison to the loss to\r\nwhich we have referred, that it is quite impossible that the one\r\nshould balance the other. Though it is undoubtedly true that the\r\ntotal quantity of energy in the universe is constant, yet the share of\r\nthat energy belonging to any particular system such as ours declines\r\nsteadily from age to age.\r\n\r\nI may indeed remark, that the question as to what becomes of all the\r\nradiant energy which the millions of suns in the universe are daily\r\ndischarging offers a problem apparently not easy to solve; but we need\r\nnot discuss the matter at present, we are only going to trace out the\r\nvicissitudes of our own system; and whatever other changes that system\r\nmay exhibit, the fact is certain that the total quantity of energy it\r\ncontains is declining.\r\n\r\nOf the two endowments of energy and of moment of momentum originally\r\nconferred on our system the moment of momentum is the entailed estate.\r\nNo matter how the bodies may move, no matter how their actions may\r\ninterfere with one another, no matter how this body is pulled one way\r\nand the other body that way, the conservation of moment of momentum is\r\nnot imperilled, nor, no matter what losses of heat may be experienced\r\nby radiation, could the store of moment of momentum be affected. The\r\nonly conceivable way in which the quantity of moment of momentum in\r\nthe solar system could be tampered with is by the interference of some\r\nexternal attracting body. We know, however, that the stars are all\r\nsituated at such enormous distances, that the influences they can\r\nexert in the perturbation of the solar system are absolutely\r\ninsensible; they are beyond the reach of the most delicate\r\nastronomical measurements. Hence we see how the endowment of the\r\nsystem with moment of momentum has conferred upon that system a\r\nsomething which is absolutely inalienable, even to the smallest\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nBefore going any further it would be necessary for me to explain more\r\nfully than I have hitherto done the true nature of the method of\r\nestimating moment of momentum. The moment of momentum consists of two\r\nparts: there is first that due to the revolution of the bodies around\r\nthe sun; there is secondly the rotation of these bodies on their axes.\r\nLet us first think simply of a single planet revolving in a circular\r\norbit around the sun. The momentum of that planet at any moment may be\r\nregarded as the product of its mass and its velocity; then the moment\r\nof momentum of the planet in the case mentioned is found by\r\nmultiplying the momentum by the radius of the path pursued. In a more\r\ngeneral case, where the planet does not revolve in a circle, but\r\npursued an elliptic path, the moment of momentum is to be found by\r\nmultiplying the planet's velocity and its mass into the perpendicular\r\nfrom the sun on the direction in which the planet is moving.\r\n\r\nThese rules provide the methods for estimating all the moments of\r\nmomentum, so far as the revolutions in our system are concerned. For\r\nthe rotations somewhat more elaborate processes are required. Let us\r\nthink of a sphere rotating round a fixed axis. Every particle of that\r\nsphere will of course describe a circle around the axis, and all these\r\ncircles will lie in parallel planes. We may for our present purpose\r\nregard each atom of the body as a little planet revolving in a\r\ncircular orbit, and therefore the moment of momentum of the entire\r\nsphere will be found by simply adding together the moments of momentum\r\nof all the different atoms of which the sphere is composed. To perform\r\nthis addition the use of an elaborate mathematical method is required.\r\nI do not propose to enter into the matter any further, except to say\r\nthat the total moment of momentum is the product of two factors--one\r\nthe angular velocity with which the sphere is turning round, while the\r\nother involves the sphere's mass and dimensions.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the principles of the computation we shall take one or\r\ntwo examples. Suppose that two circles be drawn, one of which is\r\ndouble the diameter of the other. Let two planets be taken of equal\r\nmass, and one of these be put to revolve in one circle, and the other\r\nto revolve in the other circle, in such a way that the periods of both\r\nrevolutions shall be equal. It is required to find the moments of\r\nmomentum in the two cases. In the larger of the two circles it is\r\nplain that the planet must be moving twice as rapidly as in the\r\nsmaller, therefore its momentum is twice as great; and as the radius\r\nis also double, it follows that the moment of momentum in the large\r\norbit will be four times that in the small orbit. We thus see that the\r\nmoment of momentum increases in the proportion of the squares of the\r\nradii. If, however, the two planets were revolving about the same sun,\r\none of these orbits being double the other, the periodic times could\r\nnot be equal, for Kepler's law tells us that the square of the\r\nperiodic time is proportional to the cube of the mean distance.\r\nSuppose, then, that the distance of the first planet is 1, and that of\r\nthe second planet is 2, the cubes of those numbers are 1 and 8, and\r\ntherefore the periodic times of the two bodies will be as 1 to the\r\nsquare root of 8. We can thus see that the velocity of the outer body\r\nmust be less than that of the inner one, for while the length of the\r\npath is only double as large, the time taken to describe that path is\r\nthe square root of eight times as great; in fact, the velocity of the\r\nouter body will be only the square root of twice that of the inner\r\none. As, however, its distance from the sun is twice as great, it\r\nfollows that the moment of momentum of the outer body will be the\r\nsquare root of twice that of the inner body. We may state this result\r\na little more generally as follows--\r\n\r\nIn comparing the moments of momentum of the several planets which\r\nrevolve around the sun, that of each planet is proportional to the\r\nproduct of its mass with the square root of its distance from the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nLet us now compare two spheres together, the diameter of one sphere\r\nbeing double that of the other, while the times of rotation of the two\r\nare identical. And let us now compare together the moments of momentum\r\nin these two cases. It can be shown by reasoning, into which I need\r\nnot now enter, that the moment of momentum of the large sphere will be\r\nthirty-two times that of the small one. In general we may state that\r\nif a sphere of homogeneous material be rotating about an axis, its\r\nmoment of momentum is to be expressed by the product of its angular\r\nvelocity by the fifth power of its radius.\r\n\r\nWe can now take stock, as it were, of the constituents of moments of\r\nmomentum in our system. We may omit the satellites for the present,\r\nwhile such unsubstantial bodies as comets and such small bodies as\r\nmeteors need not concern us. The present investment of the moment of\r\nmomentum of our system is to be found by multiplying the mass of each\r\nplanet by the square root of its distance from the sun; these products\r\nfor all the several planets form the total revolutional moment of\r\nmomentum. The remainder of the investment is in rotational moment of\r\nmomentum, the collective amount of which is to be estimated by\r\nmultiplying the angular velocity of each planet into its density, and\r\nthe fifth power of its radius if the planet be regarded as\r\nhomogeneous, or into such other power as may be necessary when the\r\nplanet is not homogeneous. Indeed, as the denser parts of the planet\r\nnecessarily lie in its interior, and have therefore neither the\r\nvelocity nor the radius of the more superficial portions, it seems\r\nnecessary to admit that the moments of momentum of the planets will be\r\nproportional to some lower power of the radius than the fifth. The\r\ntotal moment of momentum of the planets by rotation, when multiplied\r\nby a constant factor, and added to the revolutional moment of\r\nmomentum, will remain absolutely constant.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to note the present disposition of this vast\r\ninheritance among the different bodies of our system. The biggest item\r\nof all is the moment of momentum of Jupiter, due to its revolution\r\naround the sun; in fact, in this single investment nearly sixty per\r\ncent. of the total moment of momentum of the solar system is found.\r\nThe next heaviest item is the moment of momentum of Saturn's\r\nrevolution, which is twenty-four per cent. Then come the similar\r\ncontributions of Uranus and Neptune, which are six and eight per cent.\r\nrespectively. Only one more item is worth mentioning, as far as\r\nmagnitude is concerned, and that is the nearly two per cent. that the\r\nsun contains in virtue of its _rotation_. In fact, all the other\r\nmoments of momentum are comparatively insignificant in this method of\r\nviewing the subject. Jupiter from his rotation has not the fifty\r\nthousandth part of his revolutional moment of momentum, while the\r\nearth's rotational share is not one ten thousandth part of that of\r\nJupiter, and therefore is without importance in the general aspect of\r\nthe system. The revolution of the earth contributes about one eight\r\nhundredth part of that of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThese facts as here stated will suffice for us to make a forecast of\r\nthe utmost the tides can effect in the future transformation of our\r\nsystem. We have already explained that the general tendency of tidal\r\nfriction is to augment revolutional moment of momentum at the expense\r\nof rotational. The total, however, of the rotational moment of\r\nmomentum of the system barely reaches two per cent. of the whole\r\namount; this is of course almost entirely contributed by the sun, for\r\nall the planets together have not a thousandth part of the sun's\r\nrotational moment. The utmost therefore that tidal evolution can\r\neffect in the system is to distribute the two per cent. in augmenting\r\nthe revolutionary moment of momentum. It does not seem that this can\r\nproduce much appreciable derangement in the configuration of the\r\nsystem. No doubt if it were all applied to one of the smaller planets\r\nit would produce very considerable effect. Our earth, for instance,\r\nwould have to be driven out to a distance many hundreds of times\r\nfurther than it is at present were the sun's disposable moment of\r\nmomentum ultimately to be transferred to the earth alone. On the other\r\nhand, Jupiter could absorb the whole of the sun's share by quite an\r\ninsignificant enlargement of its present path. It does not seem likely\r\nthat the distribution that must ultimately take place can much affect\r\nthe present configuration of the system.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the tides do not appear to have exercised anything\r\nlike the same influence in the affairs of our solar system generally\r\nwhich they have done in that very small part of the solar system which\r\nconsists of the earth and moon. This is, as I have endeavoured to show\r\nin these lectures, the scene of supremely interesting tidal phenomena;\r\nbut how small it is in comparison with the whole magnitude of our\r\nsystem may be inferred from the following illustration. I represent\r\nthe whole moment of momentum of our system by £1,000,000,000, the bulk\r\nof which is composed of the revolutional moments of momentum of the\r\ngreat planets, and the rotational moment of momentum of the sun. On\r\nthis scale the rotational share which has fallen to our earth and moon\r\ndoes not even rise to the dignity of a single pound, it can only be\r\nrepresented by the very modest figure of 19_s._ 5_d._ This is divided\r\ninto two parts--the earth by its rotation accounts for 3_s._ 4_d._,\r\nleaving 16_s._ 1_d._ as the equivalent of the revolution of the moon.\r\nThe other inferior planets have still less to show than the earth.\r\nVenus can barely have more than 2_s._ 6_d._; even Mars' two satellites\r\ncannot bring his figure up beyond the slender value of 1½_d._;\r\nwhile Mercury will be amply represented by the smallest coin known at\r\nher Majesty's mint.\r\n\r\nThe same illustration will bring out the contrast between the Jovian\r\nsystem and our earth system. The rotational share of the former would\r\nbe totally represented by a sum of nearly £12,000; of this, however,\r\nJupiter's satellites only contribute about £89, notwithstanding that\r\nthere are four of them. Thus Jupiter's satellites have not one\r\nhundredth part of the moment of momentum which the rotation of Jupiter\r\nexhibits. How wide is the contrast between this state of things and\r\nthe earth-moon system, for the earth does not contain in its rotation\r\none-fifth of the moment of momentum that the moon has in its\r\nrevolution; in fact, the moon has gradually robbed the earth, which\r\noriginally possessed 19_s._ 5_d._, of which the moon has carried off\r\nall but 3_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\nAnd this process is still going on, so that ultimately the earth will\r\nbe left very poor, though not absolutely penniless, at least if the\r\nretention of a halfpenny can be regarded as justifying that assertion.\r\nSaturn, revolving as it does with great rapidity, and having a very\r\nlarge mass, possesses about £2700, while Uranus and Neptune taken\r\ntogether would figure for about the same amount.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let us revert again to the two critical conditions of\r\nthe earth-moon system. As to what happened before the first critical\r\nperiod, the tides tell us nothing, and every other line of reasoning\r\nvery little; we can to some extent foresee what may happen after the\r\nsecond critical epoch is reached, at a time so remote that I do not\r\nventure even to express the number of ciphers which ought to follow\r\nthe significant digit in the expression for the number of years. I\r\nmentioned, however, that at this time the sun tides will produce the\r\neffect of applying a still further brake to the rotation of the earth,\r\nso that ultimately the month will have become a shorter period than\r\nthe day. It is therefore interesting for us to trace out the tidal\r\nhistory of a system in which the satellite revolves around the primary\r\nin less time than the primary takes to go round on its own axis--such\r\na system, in fact, as Mars would present at this moment were the outer\r\nsatellite to be abstracted. The effect of the tides on the planet\r\nraised by its satellite would then be to accelerate its rotation; for\r\nas the planet, so to speak, lags behind the tides, friction would now\r\nmanifest itself by the continuous endeavour to drag the primary round\r\nfaster. The gain of speed, however, thus attained would involve the\r\nprimary in performing more than its original share of the moment of\r\nmomentum; less moment of momentum would therefore remain to be done by\r\nthe satellite, and the only way to accomplish this would be for the\r\nsatellite to come inwards and revolve in a smaller orbit.\r\n\r\nWe might indeed have inferred this from the considerations of energy\r\nalone, for whatever happens in the deformation of the orbit, heat is\r\nproduced by the friction, and this heat is lost, and the total energy\r\nof the system must consequently decline. Now if it be a consequence of\r\nthe tides that the velocity of the primary is accelerated, the energy\r\ncorresponding to that velocity is also increased. Hence the primary\r\nhas more energy than it had before; this energy must have been\r\nobtained at the expense of the satellite; the satellite must therefore\r\ndraw inwards until it has yielded up enough of energy not alone to\r\naccount for the increased energy of the primary, but also for the\r\nabsolute loss of energy by which the whole operation is characterized.\r\n\r\nIt therefore appears that in the excessively remote future the retreat\r\nof the moon will not only be checked, but that the moon may actually\r\nreturn to a point to be determined by the changes in the earth's\r\nrotation. It is, however, extremely difficult to follow up the study\r\nof a case where the problem of three bodies has become even more\r\ncomplicated than usual.\r\n\r\nThe importance of tidal evolution in our solar system has also to be\r\nviewed in connection with the celebrated nebular hypothesis of the\r\norigin of the solar system. Of course it would be understood that\r\ntidal evolution is in no sense a rival doctrine to that of the nebular\r\ntheory. The nebular origin of the sun and the planets sculptured out\r\nthe main features of our system; tidal evolution has merely come into\r\nplay as a subsidiary agent, by which a detail here or a feature there\r\nhas been chiselled into perfect form. In the nebular theory it is\r\nbelieved that the planets and the sun have all originated from the\r\ncooling and the contraction of a mighty heated mass of vapours. Of\r\nlate years this theory, in its main outlines at all events, has\r\nstrengthened its hold on the belief of those who try to interpret\r\nnature in the past by what we see in the present. The fact that our\r\nsystem at present contains some heat in other bodies as well as in the\r\nsun, and the fact that the laws of heat require continual loss by\r\nradiation, demonstrate that our system, if we look back far enough,\r\nand if the present laws have acted, must have had in part, at all\r\nevents, an origin like that which the nebular theory would suppose.\r\n\r\nI feel that I have in the progress of these two lectures been only\r\nable to give the merest outline of the theory of tidal evolution in\r\nits application to the earth-moon system. Indeed I have been obliged,\r\nby the nature of the subject, to omit almost entirely any reference to\r\na large body of the parts of the theory. I cannot bring myself to\r\nclose these lectures without just alluding to this omission, and\r\nwithout giving expression to the fact, that I feel it is impossible\r\nfor me to have rendered adequate justice to the strength of the\r\nargument on which we claim that tidal evolution is the most rational\r\nmode of accounting for the present condition in which we find the\r\nearth-moon system. Of course it will be understood that we have never\r\ncontended that the tides offer the only conceivable theory as to the\r\npresent condition of things. The argument lies in this wise. A certain\r\nbody of facts are patent to our observation. The tides offer an\r\nexplanation as to the origin of these facts. The tides are a _vera\r\ncausa_, and in the absence of other suggested causes, the tidal theory\r\nholds the field. But much will depend on the volume and the\r\nsignificance of the group of associated facts of which the doctrine\r\noffers a solution. The facts that it has been in my power to discuss\r\nwithin the compass of discourses like the present, only give a very\r\nmeagre and inadequate notion of the entire phenomena connected with\r\nthe moon which the tides will explain. We have not unfrequently, for\r\nthe sake of simplicity, spoken of the moon's orbit as circular, and we\r\nhave not even alluded to the fact that the plane of that orbit is\r\ninclined to the ecliptic. A comprehensive theory of the moon's origin\r\nshould render an account of the eccentricity of the moon's orbit; it\r\nmust also involve the obliquity of the ecliptic, the inclination of\r\nthe moon's orbit, and the direction of the moon's axis. I have been\r\nperforce compelled to omit the discussion of these attributes of the\r\nearth-moon system, and in doing so I have inflicted what is really an\r\ninjustice on the tidal theory. For it is the chief claim of the theory\r\nof tidal evolution, as expounded by Professor Darwin, that it links\r\ntogether all these various features of the earth-moon system. It\r\naffords a connected explanation, not only of the fact that the moon\r\nalways turns the same face to the earth, but also of the eccentricity\r\nof the moon's path around the earth, and the still more difficult\r\npoints about the inclinations of the various axes and orbits of the\r\nplanets. It is the consideration of these points that forms the\r\nstronghold of the doctrine of tidal evolution. For when we find that a\r\ntheory depending upon influences that undoubtedly exist, and are in\r\nceaseless action around us, can at the same time bring into connection\r\nand offer a common explanation of a number of phenomena which would\r\notherwise have no common bond of union, it is impossible to refuse to\r\nbelieve that such a theory does actually correspond to nature.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of mathematicians have ever found in astronomy problems\r\nwhich tax, and problems which greatly surpass, the utmost efforts of\r\nwhich they are capable. The usual way in which the powers of the\r\nmathematician have been awakened into action is by the effort to\r\nremove some glaring discrepancy between an imperfect theory and the\r\nfacts of observation. The genius of a Laplace or a Lagrange was\r\nexpended, and worthily expended, in efforts to show how one planet\r\nacted on another planet, and produced irregularities in its orbit; the\r\ngenius of an Adams and a Leverrier was nobly applied to explain the\r\nirregularities in the motion of Uranus, and to discover a cause of\r\nthose irregularities in the unseen Neptune. In all these cases, and in\r\nmany others which might be mentioned, the mathematician has been\r\nstimulated by the laudable anxiety to clear away some blemish from the\r\ntheory of gravitation throughout the system. The blemish was seen to\r\nexist before its removal was suggested. In that application of\r\nmathematics with which we have been concerned in these lectures the\r\ncall for the mathematician has been of quite a different kind. A\r\ncertain familiar phenomenon on our sea-coasts has invited attention.\r\nThe tidal ripples murmur a secret, but not for every ear. To interpret\r\nthat secret fully, the hearer must be a mathematician. Even then the\r\ninterpretation can only be won after the profoundest efforts of\r\nthought and attention, but at last the language has been made\r\nintelligible. The labour has been gloriously rewarded, and an\r\ninteresting chapter of our earth's history has for the first time been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of these lectures I have sought to interest you in\r\nthose profound investigations which the modern mathematician has made\r\nin his efforts to explore the secrets of nature. He has felt that the\r\nlaws of motion, as we understand them, are bounded by no\r\nconsiderations of space, are limited by no duration of time, and he\r\nhas commenced to speculate on the logical consequences of those laws\r\nwhen time of indefinite duration is assumed to be at his disposal.\r\nFrom the very nature of the case, observations for confirmation were\r\nimpossible. Phenomena that required millions of years for their\r\ndevelopment cannot be submitted to the instruments in our\r\nobservatories. But this is perhaps one of the special reasons which\r\nmake such investigations of peculiar interest, and entitle us to speak\r\nof the revelations of Time and Tide as a romance of modern science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeen, tides at, 23\r\nAction and reaction, 69\r\nAdams, discoverer of Neptune, 186\r\nAdmiralty Manual of Scientific Inquiry, 30, 31, 34\r\nAdmiralty tide tables, 29\r\nAfrica, Krakatoa dust over, 84\r\nAnalysis, harmonic, of tides, 34\r\nAnalysis of tide into its constituents, 33\r\nAncient tides on moon, 136\r\nAnnus Magnus of solar system, 72\r\nAreas, conservation of, 61\r\nArklow, tides at, 23\r\nAscension, tides at, 24\r\nAstronomical chronology, 147\r\nAtlantic, Krakatoa dust over, 84\r\nAtlantic, tides in, 38\r\nAtmosphere, tides in, 40\r\nAvon, tides in, at Bristol, 39\r\n\r\n\r\nBall-room, illustration, 62\r\nBarometric records of Krakatoa airwave, 82\r\nBatavia, Krakatoa heard at, 83\r\nBath, hot waters at, 89\r\nBay of Fundy, 39\r\nBeds of rock, how formed, 149\r\nBirmingham, lecture at, 148\r\nBirth of moon, 118\r\nBlast iron furnace, 87\r\nBlue sun produced by Krakatoa, 84\r\nBodily tides of moon, 131\r\nBrake illustrating friction, 68\r\nBrickwork as a non-conductor, 87\r\nBristol Channel, 39\r\nBucket of water, oscillations in, 98\r\n\r\n\r\nCambrian rocks, 153\r\nCannon-ball, energy of, 51\r\nCardiff, tides at, 39\r\nCaspian Sea, tides in, 38\r\nCasting, cooling of, 79\r\nCelebes, Krakatoa heard at, 83\r\nCentral America, 86\r\nChange and full, tides at, 22\r\nChemical action in earth, 81\r\nChepstow, tides at, 39\r\nChronology, the two systems of, 147\r\nClifton, tides in Avon at, 39\r\nClock, illustration of, 49\r\nCoal, 11\r\nCoincidence of moon's rotation and revolution, 134\r\nCombustion, heat of, 92\r\nCones, volume of, 151\r\nConservation of spin or areas, 64\r\nConstituent tides, 35\r\nConsumption of energy by tides, 48\r\nCooling, laws of, 79\r\nCooling of earth from primitive heat, 87\r\nCrane, brakes on, 69\r\nCraters of moon, 94\r\nCritical epoch in earth's history, 75\r\n\r\n\r\nDarwin, 12\r\nDarwin, G.
