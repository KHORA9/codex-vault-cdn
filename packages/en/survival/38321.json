SAVING OF ROUND OVER\r\nRECTANGULAR BARNS. NOTES ON SEVERAL ROUND BARNS ON DAIRY FARMS.[A]\r\n\r\n    [A] Special acknowledgment is made to Mr. H. E. Crouch and\r\n    Mr. R. E. Brand for their assistance in working out the\r\n    detailed data which are the bases for the economic\r\n    comparisons of the round and rectangular barns made in this\r\n    bulletin.\r\n\r\nBY W. J. FRASER, CHIEF IN DAIRY HUSBANDRY\r\n\r\n    The planning, construction, and arrangement of farm buildings\r\n    do not usually receive the thought and study these subjects\r\n    warrant. How many dairymen have compared a circular, 40-cow\r\n    barn with the common rectangular building containing the same\r\n    area? How many understand that the circular structure is much\r\n    the stronger; that the rectangular form requires 22 percent\r\n    more wall and foundation to enclose the same space; and that\r\n    the cost of material is from 34 to 58 percent more for the\r\n    rectangular building?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a community in which everyone is engaged in the same occupation, one\r\nperson is likely to copy from his neighbor without apparently giving a\r\nthought as to whether or not there is a better way.\r\n\r\nIn a district of Kane county, Illinois, a certain type of dairy barn is\r\nused by nearly everyone, while in the next county a distinctly different\r\ntype prevails, and the dairy barns of another adjacent county differ\r\nfrom those of either of the former, simply because the early settlers of\r\nthis particular locality came from an eastern state and started building\r\nthe style of barn then common in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn a certain community in Ohio where a milk condensing factory is\r\nlocated, a large number of farmers have barns 36 x 60 feet, with an \"L\"\r\nthe same size. The loft of the \"L\" is used for the storage of straw, and\r\nthe cows run loose in the lower portion. These barns are all built on\r\npractically the same plan and are usually of the same size, and this is\r\nthe only community known to the writer where this form of barn is used\r\nin this manner.\r\n\r\nThis tendency to imitate emphasizes the fact that men do not exercise\r\nsufficient originality. Because most barns are rectangular is no reason\r\nthat this is the best and most economical form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY MORE ROUND BARNS ARE NOT BUILT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. BARN NO. 5. 100 FEET IN DIAMETER, SCALE 20 FEET\r\nTO ONE INCH; SHOWING INCREASED MOW CAPACITY GIVEN BY SELF-SUPPORTING\r\nROOF.]\r\n\r\nIn an early day when lumber was cheap, buildings were built of logs, or\r\nat least had heavy frames. Under these conditions, the rectangular barn\r\nwas the one naturally used, and people have followed in the footsteps of\r\ntheir forefathers in continuing this form of barn. The result is that\r\nthe economy and advantages of the round barn have apparently never been\r\nconsidered. This is because they are not obvious at first sight, and\r\nbecome fully apparent only after a detailed study of the construction.\r\nFor these reasons, the rectangular form still continues to be built,\r\naltho it requires much more lumber. As the price of lumber has advanced\r\nso materially in recent years, the possible saving in this material is a\r\nlarge item, and well worth investigating.\r\n\r\nThe objections to round barns have usually been made by those who have\r\nonly a superficial knowledge of the subject, and do not really\r\nunderstand the relative merits of the two forms. To the writer's\r\nknowledge, there has never been published a carefully figured out,\r\ndetailed comparison of a properly constructed circular barn with the\r\nrectangular barn.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with most round barns that have been built, thus far, is\r\nthat they do not have a self-supporting roof, and consequently lose many\r\nof the advantages of a properly constructed round barn. This is the\r\nprincipal reason why round barns have not become more popular. A\r\nstraight roof necessarily requires many supports in the barn below.\r\nThese are both costly and inconvenient, and make the roof no stronger\r\nthan a dome-shaped, self-supporting roof which nearly doubles the\r\ncapacity of the mow. See Fig. (1).\r\n\r\nMany who have thus disregarded capacity have also wasted lumber and made\r\na needless amount of work by chopping or hewing out the sill and plate,\r\nthus requiring more labor and lumber, besides sacrificing the greater\r\nstrength of a built-up sill. Rightly constructed round barns are,\r\nhowever, being built to a limited extent. One contractor has erected\r\ntwenty-four round barns, with self-supporting roofs, in the last nine\r\nyears. These barns vary in size from 40 feet in diameter with 18-foot\r\nposts to 102 feet in diameter with 30-foot posts.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the scarcity of round barns is the difficulty in\r\ngetting them built. Most carpenters hesitate to undertake the work\r\nbecause in the erection of a round barn the construction should be\r\nentirely different from that of the rectangular form. Many new problems\r\npresent themselves, but when these are once understood, the round barn\r\noffers no more difficulties in construction than the rectangular form.\r\nIt is, however, important to have a head carpenter who is accustomed to\r\nputting up round barns, as a man with ingenuity and experience can take\r\nadvantage of many opportunities to save labor and material.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIND OF BARN NEEDED\r\n\r\nThe first thing to consider in the erection of a barn is a convenient\r\narrangement for the purpose for which it is to be used. At the\r\nUniversity of Illinois, two years ago, a twenty-acre demonstration dairy\r\nfarm was started, the sole object being to produce the largest amount of\r\nmilk per acre at the least possible cost. To meet the requirements of a\r\nbarn for this purpose, it became imperative to build one that was\r\nconvenient for feeding and caring for the cows, economical of\r\nconstruction, and containing a large storage capacity in both silo and\r\nmow. These are the requirements of a barn for every practical dairyman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. FILLING THE SILO.]\r\n\r\nA silo was needed that could be fed from the year round. With the small\r\nnumber of cows kept, a deep enough layer of silage could not be fed off\r\neach day to keep it good thru the summer, if the silo was more than 12\r\nfeet in diameter. As this small diameter was a necessity, it would\r\nrequire two silos 33 feet deep to supply enough silage. Two silos of\r\nsuch small diameter would not only be costly, but difficult to make\r\nstand, unless built of concrete. This difficulty was overcome by using\r\nthe circular barn and placing in the center a silo which is 12 feet in\r\ndiameter and 54 feet deep, thus making the one silo, with as much\r\ncapacity as the two before mentioned, answer every purpose. This deep\r\nsilo is an important part of the round barn, as it not only forms a\r\nsupport for the roof, but is protected by the barn, thus saving the cost\r\nof siding. Then, too, besides occupying the space least valuable for\r\nother purposes, it being centrally located, is in the most convenient\r\nplace for feeding. The silage chute being open at the top forms a\r\nsuction of air, which keeps the silage odor from the barn at milking\r\ntime, and also assists in ventilation when the door to the chute is\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF THE ROUND BARN\r\n\r\n    The points of superiority that the round dairy barn shows\r\n    over the rectangular form are convenience, strength, and\r\n    cheapness.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND BARN MOST CONVENIENT\r\n\r\nConsidering that the barn on a dairy farm is used twice every day in the\r\nyear, and that for six months each year the cows occupy it almost\r\ncontinuously, and that during this time a large amount of the labor of\r\nthe farm is done inside the barn, it is evident that the question of its\r\nconvenience is a vital one. The amount of time and strength wasted in\r\nuseless labor in poorly arranged buildings is appalling. People do not\r\nstop to consider the saving in a year or a lifetime by having the barn\r\nso conveniently arranged that there is a saving of only a few seconds on\r\neach task that has to be done two or three times every day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. INTERIOR OF BARN, SECOND FLOOR, SHOWING SILO AND\r\nLOCATION OF ENSILAGE CUTTER. (TEAM UNHITCHED TO SHOW CUTTER.)]\r\n\r\nThe round barn has a special advantage in the work of distributing\r\nsilage to the cows. The feeding commences at the chute where it is\r\nthrown down, and is continued around the circle, ending with the silage\r\ncart at the chute again, ready for the next feeding. The same thing is\r\ntrue in feeding hay and grain.\r\n\r\nStill another great advantage is the large unobstructed hay mow. With\r\nthe self-supporting roof, there are no timbers whatever obstructing the\r\nmow, which means no dragging of hay around posts or over girders. The\r\nhay carrier runs on a circular track around the mow, midway between the\r\nsilo and the outside wall, and drops the hay at any desired point, thus\r\nin no case does the hay have to be moved but a few feet, which means a\r\nsaving of much labor in the mowing.\r\n\r\nTo successfully embody all of the above discussed advantages in a dairy\r\nbarn is one of the large problems in milk production. In a careful study\r\nof the barn question it soon became apparent that it was impossible to\r\nembody all of the requirements advantageously in anything but a circular\r\nform of building, and the 60-foot round barn, which is here described,\r\nwas built.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. SOUTH VIEW, SHOWING WELL LIGHTED STABLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR CONSTRUCTION THE STRONGEST\r\n\r\nThe circular construction is the strongest, because it takes advantage\r\nof the lineal, instead of the breaking strength of the lumber. Each row\r\nof boards running around the barn forms a hoop that holds the barn\r\ntogether. A barrel, properly hooped and headed, is almost indestructible,\r\nand much stronger than a box, altho the hoops are small. This strength\r\nis because the stress comes on the hoops in a lineal direction. Any\r\npiece of timber is many times stronger on a lineal pull than on a\r\nbreaking stress. Take for example a No. 1 yellow pine 2 x 6, 16 feet\r\nlong, with an actual cross section of 1-5/8 x 5-5/8 inches. If placed\r\non edge and supported at the ends, as a joist, the limit of safety for a\r\nload evenly distributed is 642 pounds, while the limit of safety for a\r\nload in the lineal direction of the same piece of timber is 12,800\r\npounds, or twenty times as great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. IN COW STABLE, SHOWING SILO AND FEED ALLEY IN\r\nCENTER OF BARN; STANCHIONS ON RIGHT, MILK SCALES AND RECORD SHEET ON\r\nLEFT.]\r\n\r\nAll exposed surfaces of a round barn are circular, as both the sides and\r\nroof are arched, which is the strongest form of construction to resist\r\nwind pressure; besides, the wind, in striking it, glances off and can\r\nget no direct hold on the walls or roof, as it can on the flat sides or\r\ngable ends of a rectangular structure. If the lumber is properly placed\r\nin a round barn, much of it will perform two or more functions. Every\r\nrow of siding boards running around the building serves also as a brace,\r\nand the same is true of the roof boards and the arched rafters. If the\r\nsiding is put on vertically and the roof built dome-shaped, no\r\nscaffolding is required inside or out. These are points of economy in\r\nthe round construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECTANGULAR BARNS REQUIRE 34 TO 58 PERCENT MORE MATERIAL\r\n\r\nIn order to compare the amount and cost of material in round and\r\nrectangular barns, the following figures have been carefully worked out\r\nby an expert barn builder. Two comparisons, based on wood construction\r\nthruout, are made, in which round barns 60 feet and 90 feet in diameter\r\nare compared with both plank and mortise frame rectangular barns\r\ncontaining the same number of square feet of floor space, respectively.\r\nSince the most practical width of a rectangular dairy barn is 36 feet,\r\nits length will depend upon the number of square feet required in the\r\nbarn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF MORTISE FRAME BARN, END\r\nVIEW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF PLANK FRAME BARN, SIDE\r\nVIEW.]\r\n\r\nFigures 6 to 9 are side and end views, showing the detail construction\r\nand size of the timbers of the plank frame and mortise frame barns here\r\nfigured. The detailed figures of the lumber bills for each of these\r\nbarns were carefully worked out, but are too voluminous for publication\r\nhere. The total number of feet of each kind of lumber required is given\r\nin Tables 1A and 1B. Since the proportion of the different kinds of\r\nlumber and shingles varied for the different barns, to draw an exact\r\ncomparison it was necessary to base it upon the money value, and for\r\nthis purpose the total cost of lumber has been figured in each case. The\r\nlumber values used thruout are the best average prices that could be\r\nobtained. As the same prices are used for the material of all the barns,\r\nthe comparisons of cost are correct, altho these exact prices will not\r\nhold for all localities and all times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF PLANK FRAME BARN, END\r\nVIEW.]\r\n\r\nSince a silo cannot be economically built inside of a rectangular barn,\r\nthe first comparison is made with the barns simply enclosed, altho one\r\nof the chief advantages of a round barn is the deep silo which it is\r\npossible to build so economically in the center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF MORTISE FRAME BARN, SIDE\r\nVIEW.]\r\n\r\nAnother item of economy in the circular barn is less framing lumber.\r\nThis form has the strongest possible construction with the least lumber\r\nin the frame, and the least bracing, not a single timber larger than a\r\n2 x 6 being required above the sill. The arched circular roof requires no\r\nsupports, and no scaffolding is needed inside during its construction.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying tables show the comparative amount and value of lumber\r\nand cubical content in round barns 60 and 90 feet in diameter, and\r\nrectangular barns of equal area and height of posts.\r\n\r\nTABLE 1A.--A COMPARISON OF THE COST OF MATERIAL IN ROUND AND RECTANGULAR\r\nBARNS OF THE SAME AREA, _Not Including_ Foundation And Silos.\r\n\r\n  A: Framing lumber,\r\n  B: Sheathing, siding, and flooring,\r\n  C: Shingles,\r\n  D: Bolts,\r\n  E: Total cost of lumber,\r\n  F: Content, cubic feet,\r\n\r\n  ==+=====================+===========================================\r\n    |                     |    Rectangular barn, 36 x 78-1/2 ft.\r\n    |     Round barn,     +---------------------+---------------------\r\n    | 60 feet in diameter |    Plank frame      |   Mortise frame\r\n  --+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n  A | 13,976 ft. @ $25    | 19,833 ft. @ $25    | 29,074 ft. @ $25\r\n    |           = $349.40 |           = $495.83 |           = $726.85\r\n  B | 12,971 ft. @ $22    | 15,355 ft. @ $22    | 15,355 ft. @ $22\r\n    |           =  285.36 |            = 337.81 |           =  337.81\r\n  C | 44,000 @ $3.75      | 45,000 @ $3.75      | 45,000 @ $3.75\r\n    |           =  165.00 |            = 168.75 |           =  168.75\r\n  D |                     |               20.88 |\r\n  --+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n  E |            =$799.76=|           =$1023.27=|           =$1233.41=\r\n  ==+=====================+=====================+=====================\r\n  F | =117,669=           | =117,138=           | =117,138=\r\n  ==+=====================+=====================+=====================\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1B.\r\n\r\n  A: Framing lumber,\r\n  B: Sheathing, siding, and flooring,\r\n  C: Shingles,\r\n  D: Bolts,\r\n  E: Total cost of lumber,\r\n  F: Content, cubic feet,\r\n\r\n  ==+=====================+===========================================\r\n    |                     |    Rectangular barn, 36 x 176-3/4 ft.\r\n    |     Round barn,     +---------------------+---------------------\r\n    | 90 feet in diameter |    Plank frame      |   Mortise frame\r\n  --+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n  A | 30,899 ft. @ $25    | 38,815 ft. @ $25    | 59,481 ft. @$25\r\n    |           = $772.48 |           = $970.38 |           = $1487.03\r\n  B | 22,375 ft. @ $22    | 28,547 ft. @ $22    | 28,547 ft. @ $22\r\n    |           =  492.25 |           =  628.03 |           =   628.03\r\n  C | 97,000   @ $3.75    | 102,000  @ $3.75    | 102,000  @ $3.75\r\n    |           =  363.75 |            = 382.50 |             = 382.50\r\n  D |                     |               26.76 |\r\n  --+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n  E |          =$1628.48= |          =$2007.67= |           =$2497.56=\r\n  ==+=====================+=====================+=====================\r\n  F | =322,952=           | =270,570=           | =270,570=\r\n  ==+=====================+=====================+=====================\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND AND RECTANGULAR BARNS COMPARED\r\n\r\nIn comparing the 60-foot round barn with a rectangular barn of the same\r\narea, the two barns should afford the cows the same amount of space on\r\nthe platform. Allowing each cow in the 60-foot round barn 3 feet 6\r\ninches in width at the rear of the platform, it will accommodate 40 cows\r\nand leave space for two passage ways. But in a rectangular barn, only 3\r\nfeet 4 inches of platform space need be allowed for each cow, and the\r\n78-1/2 foot barn, with two 3-foot passage ways across it for convenience\r\nin feeding, will accommodate 42 cows. While the rectangular barn has\r\nstall room for two more cows, the round barn contains space in the\r\ncenter for a silo 18 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe floor space and cubical content of the round barn 60 feet in\r\ndiameter, and the rectangular barn compared with it in these tables, are\r\npractically the same, and the barns are therefore directly comparable.\r\nThis being true, the percentages which were figured from the complete\r\nbills of material for these barns show the exact saving in lumber on the\r\n60-foot round barn over the plank and mortise frame rectangular barns\r\n36 x 78-1/2 feet. The lumber bills of the rectangular barns show an\r\nincrease in cost of 28 percent for the plank frame and 54 percent for\r\nthe mortise frame. The round barn, 60 feet in diameter, contains\r\n188-1/2, and the rectangular barn 225 lineal feet of wall. The\r\nrectangular barn has, therefore, 22 percent more lineal feet of outside\r\nbarn wall, requiring a proportional increase in both paint and\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThe 176-3/4-foot rectangular barn would hold 100 cows, allowing each cow\r\n3 feet 4 inches in width and providing for 3 passage ways of 3 feet each\r\nacross the barn.\r\n\r\nThe 90-foot round barn would hold 100 cows in two rows headed together,\r\n65 of which would be in the outer circle, and have 3 feet 6 inches each\r\nin width at the gutter. This leaves sufficient room for feed alleys and\r\nwalks, and two passage ways, one three feet and the other seven feet\r\nwide for the manure and feed carriers. All of this is outside of a\r\ncentral space for a silo 20 feet in diameter and 71 feet high, with a\r\ncapacity for 620 tons of silage, and in the mow there would still be an\r\nexcess, above the capacity of the rectangular barn, of 33,000 cubic\r\nfeet, which would hold 66 tons of hay, or as much as the entire mow of\r\na barn 32 x 36 feet with 20-foot posts.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2A.--A COMPARISON OF THE COST OF MATERIAL IN ROUND AND RECTANGULAR\r\nBARNS, _Including_ FOUNDATION AND SILOS.\r\n\r\n  ========================+=============+=============================\r\n                          | Round barn, | Rectangular barn,\r\n                          | 60 feet in  |          36 x 78-1/2 ft.\r\n                          |  diameter   +-------------+---------------\r\n                          |             | Plank frame | Mortise frame\r\n  ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\r\n  Lumber in barn,         |   $799.76   |  $1023.27   |  $1233.41\r\n  Material in foundation, |     86.89   |    105.90   |    105.90\r\n  Material in silo,       |    159.01   |    295.26   |    295.26\r\n  ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\r\n  Total cost of material  |             |             |\r\n    in barn,              | =$1045.66=  | =$1424.43=  | =$1634.57=\r\n  ========================+=============+=============+===============\r\n  Actual money saved,     |             |  =$378.77=  |  =$588.91=\r\n  ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\r\n  Proportional cost,      |    =100%=   |    =136%=   |    =156%=\r\n  ========================+=============+=============+===============\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2B.\r\n\r\n  ========================+=============+=============================\r\n                          | Round barn, | Rectangular barn,\r\n                          | 90 feet in  |          36 x 176-3/4 ft.\r\n                          |  diameter   +-------------+---------------\r\n                          |             | Plank frame | Mortise frame\r\n  ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\r\n  Lumber in barn,         |  $1628.48   |  $2007.67   |  $2497.56\r\n  Material in foundation, |    130.35   |    196.80   |    196.80\r\n  Material in silo,       |    265.00   |    513.52   |    513.52\r\n  ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\r\n  Total cost of material  |             |             |\r\n    in barn,              | =$2023.83=  | =$2717.99=  | =$3207.88=\r\n  ========================+=============+=============+===============\r\n  Actual money saved,     |             |  =$694.16=  | =$1184.05=\r\n  ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\r\n  Proportional cost,      |    =100%=   |    =134%=   |    =158%=\r\n  ========================+=============+=============+===============\r\n\r\n\r\nThe square feet of floor space in the round barn 90 feet in diameter and\r\nrectangular barn 36 x 176-3/4 feet are the same, but the cubical content\r\nof the former is more than that of the latter. The increase in the\r\nlumber bill is 23 percent in the plank frame and 53 percent in the\r\nmortise frame barn. The round barn 90 feet in diameter contains 283 and\r\nthe rectangular barn 426 lineal feet of wall. The rectangular barn has,\r\ntherefore, 50 percent more lineal feet of outside barn wall, requiring a\r\nproportional increase in both paint and foundation.\r\n\r\nThe smaller surface on the outside wall of the round barn requires less\r\npaint and makes a proportional saving in keeping the round barn painted\r\nin after years.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND AND RECTANGULAR BARNS, _Including Silos_, COMPARED\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that a silo is a necessity for the most economical\r\nproduction of milk, a barn is not complete for a dairyman's purpose\r\nunless it includes a silo with capacity to store sufficient silage for\r\nthe herd. In the case of the round barn, the silo is most economically\r\nbuilt inside, but in the rectangular form would cause a waste of space,\r\nand for that reason is best erected outside. Therefore, in comparing a\r\nround dairy barn with a rectangular dairy barn, silos should be\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nIn figuring the cost of materials in the silos for the round and\r\nrectangular barns, the capacity needed in each case was determined in\r\nthe following manner: Allowing 40 pounds of silage per cow per day for 7\r\nwinter months and 25 pounds per cow per day for 3 months during the\r\nsummer, would require for 40 cows 220 tons; then allowing one-eighth for\r\nwaste would make the silage requirement 248 tons. As the silo in the\r\nround barn 60 feet in diameter is 53 feet deep, it would need to be only\r\n16 feet in diameter to hold 250 tons. This diameter is sufficiently\r\nsmall to allow summer feeding without waste. To erect a silo outside of\r\na barn, with sufficient stability to stand well, the height above ground\r\nshould not be much more than twice the diameter, and in order to avoid\r\nwaste for summer feeding, the diameter should not be greater than 16\r\nfeet for a herd of 40 cows. In order that a deep enough layer of silage\r\ncan be fed off each day during the summer to avoid waste, it is evident\r\nthat to store 250 tons of silage outside the barn, two silos would be\r\nrequired. One of these should be 16 feet in diameter and 36 feet deep,\r\nholding 154 tons, and the other 13 feet in diameter and 36 feet deep,\r\nholding 102 tons, making a total silo capacity of 256 tons.\r\n\r\nAs the large barns hold 100 cows, the same allowance of silage per cow\r\nfor the season would require silo capacity for 620 tons. As the silo in\r\nthe round barn 90 feet in diameter would be 71 feet deep, it would need\r\nto be only 20 feet in diameter to hold 620 tons. To store 620 tons of\r\nsilage in silos built outside the rectangular barn would require two\r\nsilos, each 20 feet in diameter and 44 feet deep.[B] These are the sizes\r\non which the figures for cost of silos of the Gurler type, given in\r\nTables 2A and 2B, were used.\r\n\r\n    [B] Since the deeper the silo the more firmly the silage\r\n    packs, one silo 71 feet deep will hold as much as two silos\r\n    of the same diameter and 44 feet deep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. INTERIOR OF COW STABLE, SHOWING WATER TROUGH\r\nWITH FLOAT VALVE, SALT BOX, AND DOOR INTO DAIRY.]\r\n\r\nThe table (page 12) is the final summing up of the cost of all the\r\nmaterial for the completed dairy barns, with silos, and shows a saving\r\nof from 34 to 58 percent in favor of the round barn and silo, or an\r\nactual money saving in this case of from $379 to $1184, depending upon\r\nthe size and construction of the barns.\r\n\r\nThoughtlessly, men go on building rectangular barns, but what would this\r\nreckless disregard of a possible saving of 34 to 58 percent mean in a\r\nyear's business on the farm? Some illustrations may help us to\r\nunderstand what this money saved in building a round barn really amounts\r\nto, and its convenience is also a great saving. If the dairyman\r\ndiscarded the idea of a rectangular barn and built a round barn\r\ninstead, he could take the money thus saved and buy one of the best\r\npure-bred sires for his herd, and also three to ten pure-bred heifers or\r\nfine grade cows. Either of these purchases might double the profit of\r\nthe herd. Or, this saving, properly applied, would purchase many\r\nlabor-saving devices which would make life less of a drudgery on many\r\ndairy farms. Is not such a saving worth while?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. COW COMFORT IN A ROUND BARN.]\r\n\r\nWhen the comparative cost and merit of two constructions are known, it\r\nis a poor financier who will pay extra for the one which is inferior. If\r\na man received bids from contractors for a building, he would be a\r\nfoolish man who would accept one which is from 34 to 58 percent higher\r\nthan the lowest bidder, especially when he knew the lowest bidder would\r\nput up the most convenient and substantial building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISADVANTAGES OF THE ROUND DAIRY BARN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of the round dairy barn are, that it cannot be\r\nenlarged by building on as readily as can the rectangular form, but as\r\nthe round barn may be built higher to the eaves than a rectangular barn\r\n36 feet wide, provision can be made for the growth of the herd by\r\nbuilding so as to put cows in the second story and still leave\r\nsufficient mow room for hay.\r\n\r\nThe objection is frequently raised that a round barn is difficult to\r\nlight. This difficulty is entirely overcome in a barn 90 feet or less in\r\ndiameter, if a sufficient number of properly spaced windows are used.\r\nSee Figs. 4 and 30. With the same number of windows, the light is more\r\nevenly distributed in a round barn and the sun can shine directly into\r\nsome portion at all hours of the day during the winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. FIRST STORY WALL, AND FOUNDATION FOR SILO, FEED\r\nALLEY, AND MANGER; SILL IN PLACE, READY FOR JOISTS AND STUDS.]\r\n\r\nThe objection has been raised that rectangular objects cannot be placed\r\nin a circle without a waste of space, but this does not apply to a dairy\r\nbarn, as the storage of hay and grain depends upon cubical content,\r\nalone, and silos should always be circular, no matter where built. Cows,\r\nwhen lying down, are decidedly wedge-shaped, requiring much less space\r\nin front than behind. The objection may be raised, with round barns\r\nlarge enough for two rows of cows, that the row headed out does not use\r\nthe space as economically as in the rectangular form, because a cow\r\nneeds more width at the rear of the platform than at the manger. Where\r\nthere are two rows of cows, the inner row is usually headed out, and as\r\nonly about one-third of the cows are in this row, this loss of space is\r\ncounterbalanced by the large number of cows in the outer circle using\r\nthe space more economically than they do in the rectangular barn.\r\n\r\nBox stalls cannot be as conveniently arranged, but in a one-row barn,\r\ngates hung on the outside and swung around to the manger, form stalls\r\nfor cows at freshening time, and in a barn with two rows, box stalls can\r\nbe arranged in the inner circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE ROUND BARN AT THE UNIVERSITY WAS BUILT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe barn is located on the side of a hill, sloping gently to the south\r\nand east. With this location, it was an advantage to excavate 5 feet\r\ndeep on the northwest and run out to the surface of the ground on the\r\nsoutheast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. SHOWING TEMPORARY BRACING TO HOLD STUDS IN PLACE\r\nWHILE SHIP LAP CEILING IS NAILED ON.]\r\n\r\nThe footing for the foundation is 18 inches wide. A ten-inch brick wall\r\nwas carried up nine feet above the stable floor. This wall contains a\r\n2-inch air space to prevent moisture from condensing on the inner wall\r\nand making the barn damp. This is an important point, as barns with a\r\nsolid stone or brick wall are very objectionable on account of dampness.\r\nIt has been proven by two years' use that this difficulty is entirely\r\nobviated by the air space in the wall.\r\n\r\nThe foundation for the manger and feed alley is built up 2 feet above\r\nthe stable floor. The foundation for the silo extends 4 feet below the\r\nstable floor and is continued 9 inches above the floor in the feed\r\nalley. This silo wall, together with the foundation under the manger,\r\nforms the foundation for the center supports of the barn. Fig. 12 shows\r\nthe foundation completed.\r\n\r\nThe silo, which is the Gurler type, was then started and carried up with\r\nthe barn. It was built by placing 2 x 4 studs around the circle, one\r\nfoot on centers, and ceiling inside with 1/2 x 6-inch lumber. This\r\n1/2-inch lumber was obtained by re-sawing 1 x 6 yellow pine fencing.\r\nCommon lath were then put on horizontally in the regular way inside,\r\nwithout furring out, and plastered with rich cement plaster.\r\n\r\nThe sill of the barn is 6 x 6, made up of 1 x 6s, and built on top of\r\nthe wall. Building it up in this manner makes a stronger sill than can\r\nbe obtained in any other way, as it forms a continuous hoop around the\r\nbarn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. SHOWING HEIGHT AND CONSTRUCTION OF SILO, SIDING\r\nCOMPLETED, AND FOUR MAIN RAFTERS IN PLACE.]\r\n\r\nThe joists are 2 x 12s notched 6 inches to fit the sill, so that the\r\nouter ends rest on both the sill and the brick wall. The outer span of\r\njoists is 14 feet and the inner ends of these joists rest on a similar\r\nsill built of 1 x 6s on top of the 4 x 4 supports at the stanchions. The\r\ninner span of joists, between the stanchions and the silo, is 8 feet,\r\nthe outer end resting on the sill over the stanchions, and the inner end\r\non a 1-1/2 x 6-inch band, made up of three 1/2 x 6-inch pieces, running\r\naround the outside of the silo. These joists are placed 2-1/2 feet apart\r\nat the outside of the barn, and half as many joists are used in the\r\ninner span, making the joists at the silo one foot apart. The number of\r\njoists under the driveways are doubled, being only 1 foot and 3 inches\r\napart at the outside of the barn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. SHOWING ALL RAFTERS IN PLACE AND METHOD OF\r\nSHEATHING ROOF.]\r\n\r\nThe studs, which are 2 x 6s, 20 feet long, were then placed on the sill,\r\nabout 2 feet 6 inches apart, being as evenly spaced between the windows\r\nas possible, and temporarily braced, as shown in Fig. 13, until the\r\n8-inch ship lap ceiling could be nailed on the outside. This was carried\r\nup 5 feet to the second scaffold, and then covered to this height with\r\nshingles laid 5 inches to the weather. The scaffolding was then moved up\r\nand this process repeated until the siding was completed. The plate,\r\nmade up of five 1 x 4s, was then built in the notch in the top of the\r\nstuds shown in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. SHOWING HEIGHT OF SILO, CAPACITY OF BARN, AND\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF ROOF.]\r\n\r\nThe silo was completed, as before described. The rafters, which were\r\nframed on the ground, were then erected, as shown in Fig. 14, the first\r\neight going to the center of the roof, and the remaining ones were cut\r\nto rest on the plate of the silo. There are 64 framed rafters, and these\r\nare the only ones in the upper section of the roof. At the break in the\r\nroof, a header is cut in between the framed rafters, and in the lower\r\nsection a rafter is placed between these, thus making twice as many\r\nrafters in the lower section of the roof as in the upper section. After\r\nthe rafters were all in place and temporarily braced, the 1 x 2-inch\r\nsheathing was put on, as shown in Fig. 15, and the shingles, which were\r\nthe best 5/2 red cedar, were laid 5 inches to the weather on the lower\r\nsection of the roof, and 4 inches to the weather on the upper section,\r\nas this had less pitch. No chalk line was necessary, as the shingles\r\nwere laid by the sheathing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. SHOWING ARRANGEMENT OF JOISTS AND HOW THE FLOOR\r\nIS LAID.]\r\n\r\nThe floor was made of 1 x 8 ship lap, laid in four directions, as shown\r\nin Fig. 17. In the driveway an extra layer of ship lap was used, making\r\nthis portion of the floor 2 inches thick.\r\n\r\nThe doorways in the second story are 14 feet wide, and in the lower\r\nstory 12 feet. These openings are closed by two sliding doors, each door\r\nbeing made of two sections, hinged together so as to follow the circular\r\nwall of the barn in opening.\r\n\r\nThe cow stable is on the ground floor, and well lighted by 16 windows\r\nhaving twelve 9 x 12 lights each. There are also six windows in the\r\ndoors. The windows are placed just below the ceiling and admit an\r\nabundance of sunshine at all times of the day, which is one of the\r\nessentials of a good dairy barn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. SHOWING PRESENT ARRANGEMENT OF COW STABLE. THERE\r\nARE STANCHIONS AND MANGERS FOR 28 COWS, AND 2200 SQ. FT. OF FLOOR SPACE\r\nIN WHICH THE COWS CAN RUN LOOSE. THE GATES ARE SWUNG INTO THE PRESENT\r\nPOSITION WHEN BOX STALLS ARE NEEDED.]\r\n\r\nThe floor, back of the manger, is of clay, except at the door, where a\r\nsmall portion is covered with cement. The cows run loose except at\r\nfeeding and milking time, when they are placed in rigid stanchions. It\r\nmust be distinctly understood that rigid stanchions are strongly\r\ncondemned as a cow tie, where cows are to remain in them all night, but\r\nas they are here used merely to hold the cow during milking, they are\r\nboth economical and convenient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. SHOWING CROSS SECTION OF 60-FOOT ROUND BARN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. CLEANING OUT COW STABLE WITH THREE-HORSE MANURE\r\nSPREADER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. COWS IN STANCHION AT MILKING TIME.]\r\n\r\nRunning cows loose in this manner is an excellent method, where bedding\r\nis abundant and sufficient space is available, as the cows are more\r\ncomfortable, and all fertility is saved. There is no waste from\r\nleaching, as when the manure lies exposed to the weather. This method\r\nsaves the labor of cleaning the stable, as the manure is loaded into the\r\nspreader and hauled directly upon the land whenever convenient, and the\r\nland is in the best condition to receive it.[C]\r\n\r\n    [C] For a more detailed discussion of the advantages of\r\n    keeping cows in this manner, see Illinois Agricultural\r\n    Experiment Station Circular No. 93.\r\n\r\nThree gates are hung on posts at the outside wall, and when box stalls\r\nare needed, these are swung around to the manger, as shown in Fig. 18.\r\nThe south door in the cow stable can be closed by slatted gates, thus\r\naffording an abundance of fresh air and sunshine on nice days, without\r\nletting the cows out of the barn.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF VENTILATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\nThe system of ventilation is the \"King.\" To economize space and lumber,\r\nthe hay chute is used for a ventilator. This chute, which extends to the\r\ncupola, is 2-1/4 x 3-1/2 feet, having a cross section area of 8 sq. ft.,\r\nwhich, with a good draft, is sufficient for 40 cows. In order that this\r\ncombination of ventilator and hay chute prove practical, doors thru\r\nwhich the hay could be thrust were placed at intervals in the side of\r\nthe chute. These doors are hinged at the top, opening in, and close\r\nimmediately after the hay drops, thus maintaining a closed ventilator\r\nchute. The air is drawn in at the bottom, the amount being regulated by\r\nmeans of a sliding door in the side. As this chute is 50 feet high, it\r\ncreates a strong suction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILK ROOM\r\n\r\nTo economize space, the milk room, 12 x 16 feet, is located under the\r\nnorth driveway. The brick walls under the drive form the sides of this\r\nroom, and the floor of the drive, which is made of 2 x 6s grooved on\r\nboth edges, forms the roof. The grooves in the flooring were filled with\r\nwhite lead, and a wooden strip, fitted to fill the grooves of both\r\nplanks, was driven in, forming a water-tight floor. This floor was\r\ncovered with hot tar and sand 1/2 inch thick. The milk room is plastered\r\non the inside, the plaster being applied directly to the brick walls,\r\nexcepting in the case of the ceiling, which is lathed. The floor and\r\ncooling tank are of cement. The passage from the barn to the milk room\r\nis thru a small hallway, which is open to the outside, thus preventing\r\nthe stable air getting into the milk room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. FEED ALLEY, SHOWING COMBINED HAY CHUTE AND\r\nVENTILATOR. A DOOR ON THE SIDE WHICH IS HINGED AT THE BOTTOM, 3 FEET\r\nFROM THE FLOOR, IS LET IN TOWARD THE SILO, SLIDING THE HAY ONTO THE\r\nFLOOR. IN HOT WEATHER THIS OPENING TAKES THE HEAT OUT OF THE BARN;\r\nDURING THE WINTER THIS DOOR IS KEPT CLOSED AND THE VENTILATION IS\r\nREGULATED BY RAISING THE SLIDE, AS SHOWN IN THE CUT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBARN SATISFACTORY\r\n\r\nThis round dairy barn above described has been in use for over two years\r\nat the University of Illinois, and has given entire satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. NORTHEAST VIEW, SHOWING DAIRY UNDER DRIVEWAY.\r\nTHE BARN IS ON THE SAME SCALE AS THE DRAWING ON PAGE 28.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. INTERIOR OF DAIRY; COOLING TANK ON LEFT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRE-ARRANGEMENT OF BARN TO ACCOMMODATE 40 COWS\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to keep cows in stalls in a round barn of this size,\r\nthe circular manger can be enlarged to 38 feet in diameter, which gives\r\nroom for forty cows, as shown in Fig. 25, and the silo, to hold\r\nsufficient silage to feed the year round, enlarged to 18 feet in\r\ndiameter. The present mow room is sufficient to store enough hay and\r\nbedding for this number of cows.\r\n\r\nThe barn on the Twenty-acre Demonstration Dairy Farm was built this\r\nlarge, as it was thought it might be desired at some future time to\r\nincrease the size of the farm and herd, and the barn could easily be\r\nchanged to accommodate a larger herd by simply enlarging the silo,\r\nwithout rebuilding the barn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. SHOWING HOW THIS 60-FOOT BARN MAY BE ARRANGED TO\r\nACCOMMODATE 40 COWS IN STALLS.

BARN NO. 2. 80 FEET IN DIAMETER; ENGINE ROOM IN\r\nFOREGROUND.]\r\n\r\nThe cost of this barn, if built on the ordinary dairy farm, could be\r\nmaterially reduced without shortening the life of the barn. Owing to the\r\nconditions under which this barn was built, it was necessary to pay for\r\nhauling all material to the farm, two and one-half miles from town. All\r\nof the labor had to be hired, and as it was necessary for the men to\r\nboard themselves the wages paid were proportionately higher. The farmer\r\nusually does the excavating and hauls the brick, sand, and lumber with\r\nhis own teams, tends the mason, and does quite an amount of the rough\r\nwork with his own help, besides boarding the men, all of which would\r\ngreatly reduce the cost. The construction could also be cheapened by\r\nusing drop siding to cover the outside, instead of shingles, which in\r\nthis case were used over ship lap on the side walls to improve the\r\nappearance. This barn could be still further cheapened by putting hoops,\r\nfive feet apart, around the studs, and covering with common 1 x 12\r\nboards, put on vertically, as is done in some cases. A saving could also\r\nbe made on the mill work and large doors by having the carpenters make\r\nthese plainer and leave the windows out of them.\r\n\r\nAnyone wishing to build a round barn can get local bids on the lumber\r\nbill, and determine approximately the cost in his locality. This will\r\nvary with both the location and the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER ROUND DAIRY BARNS\r\n\r\n\r\nBARN NO. 2\r\n\r\nBuilt 1897.\r\n\r\nDiameter, 80 feet.\r\n\r\nCapacity, 75 cows in 2 rows, tails together, 51 head in outer circle, 24\r\nhead in inner circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. INTERIOR OF BARN NO. 2. SHOWING TWO ROWS OF\r\nSTANCHIONS AND DRIVE BEHIND COWS WHICH IS USED IN CLEANING BARN; SILO ON\r\nRIGHT.]\r\n\r\nCost, $1800.\r\n\r\nStuds, 2 x 6s, placed 2-1/2 feet on center.\r\n\r\nSupports, two 2 x 6s in each stanchion.\r\n\r\nJoists, main span 3 x 12s, 20 feet long, placed 14 inches on center.\r\nShort spans over feed alleys, 2 x 10s.\r\n\r\nPlate, 1 x 10-inch boards sprung around near top of studs.\r\n\r\nRoof supports, 6 x 6s placed 12 feet apart. Purline plate rests on these\r\nposts and consists of 1 x 8s sprung to the circle.\r\n\r\nSiding, 8-inch, put on horizontally, first story ceiled inside.\r\n\r\nTo clean out, a wagon is driven around between the two rows of cows.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to this barn is insufficient light in the cow\r\nstable.\r\n\r\nThis barn and No. 3 are approximately the same in construction, and are\r\nmore substantially built than barns No. 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. ARRANGEMENT OF COW STABLE IN BARN NO. 2; TWO\r\nROWS OF COWS TAILED TOGETHER. THE BARN IS CLEANED BY DRIVING AROUND\r\nBEHIND THE COWS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. BARN NO. 3. 80 FEET IN DIAMETER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBARN NO. 4\r\n\r\nBuilt in 1900.\r\n\r\nDiameter, 90 feet.\r\n\r\nCapacity, 105 cows, two rows heading together.\r\n\r\nCost, $3000.\r\n\r\nFoundation, width at base and top, 18 inches; depth in ground, 20\r\ninches, (not sufficient).\r\n\r\nSills, 2 x 8s, sawed in short lengths, and placed flatwise.\r\n\r\nStudding, 20-foot 2 x 8s, placed 3 feet on center and toenailed to sill.\r\n\r\nSupports, first story 4 x 4s placed between stanchions in each row,\r\nmaking two rows of supports between the outside wall and the silo; 4 x\r\n4s cut to a circle placed on top of these supports. The outside span,\r\nover cows, is 13 feet 6 inches; middle span, over feed alley, 6 feet 8\r\ninches, and inside span, over cows, 13 feet.\r\n\r\nJoists, 2 x 8s placed 3 feet apart at studs on outside wall. There are\r\nas many joists in center of barn as at the outside.\r\n\r\nSupports, second-story, consist of one row of posts running around at a\r\npoint immediately under the break in the roof. These are 16 feet apart\r\nand are made of three 2 x 8s kept 2 inches apart by horizontal braces\r\nwhich run from studding near the eave thru these posts to studding in\r\nsilo. See Fig. 31.\r\n\r\nPlate, rafter is set on top of each stud, and no plate is used.\r\n\r\nRafters, 2 x 6s resting on studs at outside and on circular plate at\r\nbreak in roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. BARN NO. 4. 90 FEET IN DIAMETER; ONE OF THE FEW\r\nDAIRY BARNS WITH SUFFICIENT LIGHT; SAME SCALE AS DRAWING ON PAGE 37.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. SILO IN CENTER OF BARN NO. 4; UPPER PORTION IN\r\nHAY LOFT. LOWER PORTION IN COW STABLE.]\r\n\r\nSiding, 8-inch drop siding, put on horizontally, nailed with 10d nails.\r\nEnds holding well.\r\n\r\nWindows, 12 light, 10 x 12 glass; one window every six feet. This gives\r\nan abundance of light in the center of the barn.\r\n\r\nDoors, built on circle; (not satisfactory).\r\n\r\nSilo, round; diameter, 24 feet over all; height, 53 feet, exclusive of\r\n12-foot space for water tank on top; capacity, 500 tons. Studs of silo,\r\n2 x 4s placed 12 inches on center. Ceiled inside of studs with two\r\nthicknesses of half-inch lumber with paper between.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. INTERIOR OF BARN NO. 4, SHOWING STALLS AND FEED\r\nALLEY.]\r\n\r\nRemarks: Considering its size, the construction of this barn is\r\napparently too light to be substantial, as the joists and studs are too\r\nsmall and too far apart, yet it has stood for nine years with no more\r\nevidence of wear than is common with any barn.\r\n\r\nWere the owner to build again he would place the studs only 2-1/2 feet\r\napart and use 2 x 12 joists, 2-1/2 feet apart at the outside wall. He\r\nwould also use cement plaster on inside of silo.\r\n\r\nThe owner says it would have cost him as much to have built a\r\nrectangular barn without the 500-ton silo, and containing 1300 sq. ft.\r\nless floor space. In other words, he gained a 500-ton silo and 1300 sq.\r\nft. of floor space, besides an immense amount of mow room, by building a\r\ncircular barn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. ARRANGEMENT OF COW STABLE IN BARN NO. 4, 90 FEET\r\nIN DIAMETER; TWO ROWS OF COWS HEADED TOGETHER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBARN NO. 5\r\n\r\nBuilt in 1906.\r\n\r\nDiameter, 100 feet.\r\n\r\nCapacity, 115 cows.\r\n\r\nCost, $3400.\r\n\r\nStudding, 16-foot 2 x 6s, placed 3 feet on centers.\r\n\r\nSupports, 3 rows 4 x 4s.\r\n\r\nJoists, 2 x 10s, placed 3 feet on centers. Hemlock and yellow pine.\r\n\r\nFloor, laid in eight directions.\r\n\r\nRafters, 2 x 6s spiked to studs. A band of two 1 x 6s is placed around\r\nthe studs just below the rafters, and helps support the rafters.\r\n\r\nSupports for roof. There are three purline plates. Two of these are\r\nsupported by posts, the other by braces running out from the silo. The\r\nroof is straight from eaves to peak. The bracing is similar to that of\r\nbarn No. 4.\r\n\r\nSilo, 18 feet in diameter, 56 feet deep, 2 feet in ground. Capacity, 350\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.

BARN 40 FEET IN DIAMETER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. BARN 48 FEET IN DIAMETER, 16-FOOT POSTS; NOTE\r\nMETHOD OF TAKING HAY INTO SMALL ROUND BARN.]\r\n\r\nThe round barns previously described do not meet the needs of the man\r\nwith only a few cows. He usually wants a general-purpose barn. The\r\ncircular form can be made satisfactory for this purpose if proper\r\nattention is given to the plan. It is necessary that the cow stable be\r\ndistinctly separated from all other stock by a tight wall. Round barns\r\nwith this arrangement are giving satisfaction in Illinois at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF BARN IN FIG. 40. HOOPS\r\nIN PLACE READY FOR PERPENDICULAR SIDING; ROOF SHEATHED FOR SHINGLES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. BARN 102 FEET IN DIAMETER AND 85 FEET HIGH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISADVANTAGES OF THE POLYGONAL BARN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA polygonal barn has the disadvantages of both the rectangular and the\r\nround barn, and is less stable than either. It must necessarily have a\r\nheavy frame, which is expensive, and as the siding cannot run around the\r\ncorners, it is very difficult to tie the different sides together\r\nsufficiently to prevent the barn being racked by the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARN NO. 6\r\n\r\n16-sided.\r\n\r\nBuilt, 1888.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. BARN NO. 6; 85 FEET IN DIAMETER; SAME SCALE AS\r\nDRAWING ON OPPOSITE PAGE.]\r\n\r\nDiameter, 85 feet.\r\n\r\nHeight, 26-foot posts on 9-foot wall.\r\n\r\nCapacity, 88 cows; 350 tons of hay.\r\n\r\nFoundation and first story, cement wall 9 feet above cement floor.\r\n\r\nSupports, 4 x 8s, placed just back of stanchions, 3 feet on center.\r\n\r\nStuds, 2 x 10s, 26 feet long, placed 2-1/2 feet on center.\r\n\r\nJoists 3 x 12s, 20 feet long, 14 inches on center for main span.\r\n\r\nRafters, self-supporting. Sheathed with 1 x 6s with no space between.\r\nThis roof has a purline plate thrown in the gambrel. The plate is\r\nsupported only by the braces which tie the joints.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. ARRANGEMENT OF COW STABLE IN BARN NO. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe barn has been racked three times by the wind, replumbed and heavy\r\niron rods put in to brace it, yet it is out of plumb at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn summing up the data given in this bulletin, it is obvious that the\r\nadvantages of the round barn are convenience, strength, and cheapness.\r\n\r\nThe round barn is the more convenient, because of the unobstructed mow,\r\nwhich reduces the labor required in mowing hay, and because of the\r\ngreater ease and fewer steps with which the feed can be gotten to the\r\ncows, owing to the central location of the supply.\r\n\r\nThe circular construction is the strongest because advantage is taken of\r\nthe lineal strength of the lumber. All exposed surfaces are circular,\r\nand withstand greater wind pressure, as the wind can get no direct hold,\r\nas on the sides or gable ends of a rectangular barn.\r\n\r\nIn round numbers, rectangular barns require, according to their\r\nconstruction, from 34 to 58 percent more in cost of material than round\r\nbarns with the same floor area and built of the same grade of material.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER NOTES:\r\n\r\n    Punctuation has been normalized without note.\r\n\r\n    Hyphenation of words has been changed to be more consistent\r\n    throughout the text.\r\n\r\n    Page 6: \"betwen\" changed to \"between\" (midway between the silo and\r\n    the outside wall).",
