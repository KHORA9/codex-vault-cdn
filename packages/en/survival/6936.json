The nature of the work\r\nseems to be sufficiently explained by the title itself, and the author's\r\ntask has been chiefly to reduce the ordinary language into words of one\r\nsyllable. But although, as far as the subject matter is concerned, the\r\nbook can lay no claims to originality, it is believed that the idea\r\nand scope of its construction are entirely novel, for the One Syllable\r\nliterature of the present day furnishes little more than a few short,\r\nunconnected sentences, and those chiefly in spelling books.\r\n\r\nThe deep interest which De Foe's story has never failed to arouse in the\r\nminds of the young, induces the author to hope that it may be acceptable\r\nin its present form.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that exceptions to the rule of using words of one\r\nsyllable exclusively have been made in the case of the proper names\r\nof the boy Xury and of the man Friday, and in the titles of the\r\nillustrations that accompany this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBINSON CRUSOE.\r\n\r\nIN WORDS OF ONE SYLLABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born at York on the first of March in the sixth year of the reign\r\nof King Charles the First. From the time when I was quite a young child,\r\nI had felt a great wish to spend my life at sea, and as I grew, so did\r\nthis taste grow more and more strong; till at last I broke loose from\r\nmy school and home, and found my way on foot to Hull, where I soon got a\r\nplace on board a ship.\r\n\r\nWhen we had set sail but a few days, a squall of wind came on, and on\r\nthe fifth night we sprang a leak. All hands were sent to the pumps, but\r\nwe felt the ship groan in all her planks, and her beams quake from stem\r\nto stern; so that it was soon quite clear there was no hope for her, and\r\nthat all we could do was to save our lives.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to fire off guns, to show that we were in need of\r\nhelp, and at length a ship, which lay not far from us, sent a boat to\r\nour aid. But the sea was too rough for it to lie near our ship's side,\r\nso we threw out a rope, which the men in the boat caught, and made fast,\r\nand by this means we all got in. Still in so wild a sea it was in vain\r\nto try to get on board the ship which had sent out the men, or to use\r\nour oars in the boat, and all we could do was to let it drive to shore.\r\n\r\nIn the space of half an hour our own ship struck on a rock and went\r\ndown, and we saw her no more. We made but slow way to the land, which we\r\ncaught sight of now and then when the boat rose to the top of some high\r\nwave, and there we saw men who ran in crowds, to and fro, all bent on\r\none thing, and that was to save us.\r\n\r\nAt last to our great joy we got on shore, where we had the luck to meet\r\nwith friends who gave us the means to get back to Hull; and if I had now\r\nhad the good sense to go home, it would have been well for me.\r\n\r\nThe man whose ship had gone down said with a grave look, \"Young lad, you\r\nought to go to sea no more, it is not the kind, of life for you.\" \"Why\r\nSir, will you go to sea no more then?\" \"That is not the same kind of\r\nthing; I was bred to the sea, but you were not, and came on board my\r\nship just to find out what a life at sea was like, and you may guess\r\nwhat you will come to if you do not go back to your home. God will not\r\nbless you, and it may be that you have brought all this woe on us.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke not a word more to him; which way he went I knew not, nor did\r\nI care to know, for I was hurt at this rude speech. Shall I go home\r\nthought I, or shall I go to sea? Shame kept me from home, and I could\r\nnot make up my mind what course of life to take.\r\n\r\nAs it has been my fate through life to choose for the worst, so I did\r\nnow. I had gold in my purse, and good clothes on my back, and to sea I\r\nwent once more.\r\n\r\nBut I had worse luck this time than the last, for when we were far out\r\nat sea, some Turks in a small ship came on our track in full chase. We\r\nset as much sail as our yards would bear, so as to get clear from them.\r\nBut in spite of this, we saw our foes gain on us, and we felt sure that\r\nthey would come up with our ship in a few hours' time.\r\n\r\nAt last they caught us, but we brought our guns to bear on them, which\r\nmade them shear off for a time, yet they kept up a fire at us as long as\r\nthey were in range. The next time the Turks came up, some of their men\r\ngot on board our ship, and set to work to cut the sails, and do us all\r\nkinds of harm. So, as ten of our men lay dead, and most of the rest had\r\nwounds, we gave in.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Turks took me as his prize to a port which was held by\r\nthe Moors. He did not use me so ill as at first I thought he would have\r\ndone, but he set me to work with the rest of his slaves. This was a\r\nchange in my life which I did not think had been in store for me. How my\r\nheart sank with grief at the thought of those whom I had left at home,\r\nnay, to whom I had not had the grace so much as to say \"Good bye\" when I\r\nwent to sea, nor to give a hint of what I meant to do!\r\n\r\nYet all that I went through at this time was but a taste of the toils\r\nand cares which it has since been my lot to bear.\r\n\r\nI thought at first that the Turk might take me with him when next he\r\nwent to sea, and so I should find some way to get free; but the hope\r\ndid not last long, for at such times he left me on shore to see to his\r\ncrops. This kind of life I led for two years, and as the Turk knew and\r\nsaw more of me, he made me more and more free. He went out in his boat\r\nonce or twice a week to catch a kind of flat fish, and now and then he\r\ntook me and a boy with him, for we were quick at this kind of sport, and\r\nhe grew quite fond of me.\r\n\r\nOne day the Turk sent me in the boat to catch some fish, with no one\r\nelse but a man and a boy. While we were out so thick a fog came on that\r\nthough we were out not half a mile from the shore, we quite lost sight\r\nof it for twelve hours; and when the sun rose the next day, our boat was\r\nat least ten miles out at sea. The wind blew fresh, and we were all much\r\nin want of food, but at last, with the help of our oars and sail, we got\r\nback safe to land.\r\n\r\nWhen the Turk heard how we had lost our way, he said that the next time\r\nhe went out, he would take a boat that would hold all we could want if\r\nwe were kept out at sea. So he had quite a state room built in the long\r\nboat of his ship, as well as a room for us slaves. One day he sent me\r\nto trim the boat, as he had two friends who would go in it to fish with\r\nhim. But when the time came they did not go, so he sent me with the man\r\nand the boy--whose name was Xury--to catch some fish for the guests that\r\nwere to sup with him.\r\n\r\nNow the thought struck me all at once that this would be a good chance\r\nto set off with the boat, and get free. So in the first place, I took\r\nall the food that I could lay my hands on, and I told the man that it\r\nwould be too bold of us to eat of the bread that had been put in the\r\nboat for the Turk. He said he thought so too, and he brought down a\r\nsmall sack of rice and some rusks.\r\n\r\nWhile the man was on shore I put up some wine, a large lump of wax, a\r\nsaw, an axe, a spade, some rope, and all sorts of things that might be\r\nof use to us. I knew where the Turk's case of wine was, and I put that\r\nin the boat while the man was on shore. By one more trick I got all that\r\nI had need of. I said to the boy, \"the Turk's guns are in the boat, but\r\nthere is no shot. Do you think you could get some? You know where it is\r\nkept, and we may want to shoot a fowl or two.\" So he brought a case and\r\na pouch which held all that we could want for the guns. These I put in\r\nthe boat, and then set sail out of the port to fish.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew, from the North, or North West, which was a bad wind for\r\nme; for had it been South I could have made for the coast of Spain. But,\r\nblow which way it might, my mind was made up to get off, and to leave\r\nthe rest to fate. I then let down my lines to fish, but I took care to\r\nhave bad sport; and when the fish bit, I would not pull them up, for\r\nthe Moor was not to see them. I said to him, \"This will not do, we shall\r\ncatch no fish here, we ought to sail on a bit.\" Well, the Moor thought\r\nthere was no harm in this. He set the sails, and, as the helm was in my\r\nhands, I ran the boat out a mile or more, and then brought her to, as if\r\nI meant to fish.\r\n\r\nNow, thought I, the time has come for me to get free! I gave the helm\r\nto the boy, and then took the Moor round the waist, and threw him out of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nDown he went! but soon rose up, for he swam like a duck. He said he\r\nwould go all round the world with me, if I would but take him in.\r\n\r\nI had some fear lest he should climb up the boat's side, and force his\r\nway back; so I brought my gun to point at him, and said, \"You can swim\r\nto land with ease if you choose, make haste then to get there; but if\r\nyou come near the boat you shall have a shot through the head, for I\r\nmean to be a free man from this hour.\"\r\n\r\nHe then swam for the shore, and no doubt got safe there, as the sea was\r\nso calm.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought I would take the Moor with me, and let Xury swim to\r\nland; but the Moor was not a man that I could trust. When he was gone I\r\nsaid to Xury, \"If you will swear to be true to me, you shall be a great\r\nman in time; if not, I must throw you out of the boat too.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor boy gave me such a sweet smile as he swore to be true to me,\r\nthat I could not find it in my heart to doubt him.\r\n\r\nWhile the man was still in view (for he was on his way to the land), we\r\nstood out to sea with the boat, so that he and those that saw us from\r\nthe shore might think we had gone to the straits' mouth, for no one went\r\nto the South coast, as a tribe of men dwelt there who were known to kill\r\nand eat their foes.\r\n\r\nWe then bent our course to the East, so as to keep in with the shore;\r\nand as we had a fair wind and a smooth sea, by the next day at noon, we\r\nwere not less than 150 miles out of the reach of the Turk.\r\n\r\nI had still some fear lest I should be caught by the Moors, so I would\r\nnot go on shore in the day time. But when it grew dark we made our way\r\nto the coast, and came to the mouth of a stream, from which we thought\r\nwe could swim to land, and then look round us. But as soon as it was\r\nquite dark we heard strange sounds--barks, roars, grunts, and howls. The\r\npoor lad said he could not go on shore till dawn. \"Well,\" said I, \"then\r\nwe must give it up, but it may be that in the day time we shall be seen\r\nby men, who for all we know would do us more harm than wild beasts.\"\r\n\"Then we give them the shoot gun,\" said Xury with a laugh, \"and make\r\nthem run away.\" I was glad to see so much mirth in the boy, and gave him\r\nsome bread and rice.\r\n\r\nWe lay still at night, but did not sleep long, for in a few hours' time\r\nsome huge beasts came down to the sea to bathe. The poor boy shook from\r\nhead to foot at the sight. One of these beasts came near our boat, and\r\nthough it was too dark to see him well, we heard him puff and blow, and\r\nknew that he must be a large one by the noise he made. At last the brute\r\ncame as near to the boat as two oars' length, so I shot at him, and he\r\nswam to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe roar and cries set up by beasts and birds at the noise of my gun\r\nwould seem to show that we had made a bad choice of a place to land\r\non; but be that as it would, to shore we had to go to find some fresh\r\nspring, so that we might fill our casks. Xury said if I would let him\r\ngo with one of the jars, he would find out if the springs were fit to\r\ndrink; and, if they were sweet, he would bring the jar back full. \"Why\r\nshould you go?\" said I; \"Why should not I go, and you stay in the boat?\"\r\nAt this Xury said, \"if wild mans come they eat me, you go way.\" I could\r\nnot but love the lad for this kind speech. \"Well,\" said I, \"we will both\r\ngo, and if the wild men come we must kill them, they shall not eat you\r\nor me.\"\r\n\r\nI gave Xury some rum from the Turk's case to cheer him up, and we went\r\non shore. The boy went off with his gun, full a mile from the spot where\r\nwe stood, and came back with a hare that he had shot, which we were\r\nglad to cook and eat; but the good news which he brought was that he had\r\nfound a spring, and had seen no wild men.\r\n\r\nI made a guess that the Cape de Verd Isles were not far off, for I saw\r\nthe top of the Great Peak, which I knew was near them. My one hope was\r\nthat if I kept near the coast, I should find some ship that would take\r\nus on board; and then, and not till then, should I feel a free man. In\r\na word, I put the whole of my fate on this chance, that I must meet with\r\nsome ship, or die.\r\n\r\nOn the coast we saw some men who stood to look at us. They were black,\r\nand wore no clothes. I would have gone on shore to them, but Xury--who\r\nknew best--said, \"Not you go! Not you go!\" So I brought the boat as near\r\nthe land as I could, that I might talk to them, and they kept up with me\r\na long way. I saw that one of them had a lance in his hand.\r\n\r\nI made signs that they should bring me some food, and they on their part\r\nmade signs for me to stop my boat. So I let down the top of my sail, and\r\nlay by, while two of them ran off; and in less than half an hour they\r\ncame back with some dry meat and a sort of corn which is grown in this\r\npart of the world. This we should have been glad to get, but knew not\r\nhow to do so; for we durst not go on shore to them, nor did they dare\r\nto come to us. At last they took a safe way for us all, for they brought\r\nthe food to the shore, where they set it, down, and then went a long way\r\noff while we took it in. We made signs to show our thanks, for we had\r\nnot a thing that we could spare to give them.\r\n\r\nBut as good luck would have it, we were at hand to take a great prize\r\nfor them; for two wild beasts, of the same kind as the first I spoke of,\r\ncame in, full chase from the hills down to the sea.\r\n\r\nThey swam as if they had come for sport. The men flew from them in fear,\r\nall but the one who held the lance. One of these beasts came near our\r\nboat; so I lay in wait for him with my gun; and as soon as the brute was\r\nin range, I shot him through the head. Twice he sank down in the sea,\r\nand twice he came up; and then just swam to the land, where he fell down\r\ndead. The men were in as much fear at the sound of my gun, as they had\r\nbeen at the sight of the beasts. But when I made signs for them to come\r\nto the shore, they took heart, and came.\r\n\r\nThey at once made for their prize; and by the help of a rope, which they\r\nslung round him, they brought him safe on the beach.\r\n\r\nWe now left our wild men, and went on and on, for twelve days more. The\r\nland in front of us ran out four or five miles, like a bill; and we had\r\nto keep some way from the coast, to make this point, so that we lost\r\nsight of the shore.\r\n\r\nI gave the helm to Xury and sat down to think what would be my best\r\ncourse to take: when all at once I heard the lad cry out \"A ship with a\r\nsail! A ship with a sail!\" He did not show much joy at the sight, for\r\nhe thought that this ship had been sent out to take him back: but I knew\r\nwell, from the look of her, that she was not one of the Turk's.\r\n\r\nI made all the sail I could to come in the ship's way, and told Xury to\r\nfire a gun, in the hope that if those on deck could not hear the sound,\r\nthey might see the smoke. This they did see, and then let down their\r\nsails so that we might come up to them, and in three hours time we were\r\nat the ship's side. The men spoke to us in French, but I could not make\r\nout what they meant. At last a Scot on board said in my own tongue, \"Who\r\nare you? Whence do you come?\" I told him in a few words how I had got\r\nfree from the Moors.\r\n\r\nThen the man who had charge of the ship bade me come on board, and took\r\nme in with Xury and all my goods. I told him that he might take all I\r\nhad, but he said \"You shall have your goods back when we come to land,\r\nfor I have but done for you what you would have done for me, had I been\r\nin the same plight.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave me a good round sum for my boat, and said that I should have the\r\nsame sum for Xury, if I would part with him. But I told him that as it\r\nwas by the boy's help that I had got free, I was loath to sell him. He\r\nsaid it was just and right in me to feel thus, but at the same time, if\r\nI could make up my mind to part with him, he should be set free in two\r\nyears' time. So, as the poor slave had a wish to go with him, I did not\r\nsay \"no.\" I got to All Saints' Bay in three weeks, and was now a free\r\nman.\r\n\r\nI had made a good sum by all my store, and with this I went on land. But\r\nI did not at all know what to do next. At length I met with a man whose\r\ncase was much the same as my own, and we both took some land to farm.\r\nMy stock, like his, was low, but we made our farms serve to keep us in\r\nfood, though not more than that. We both stood in need of help, and I\r\nsaw now that I had done wrong to part with my boy.\r\n\r\nI did not at all like this kind of life. What! thought I, have I come\r\nall this way to do that which I could have done as well at home with\r\nmy friends round me! And to add to my grief, the kind friend, who had\r\nbrought me here in his ship, now meant to leave these shores.\r\n\r\nOn my first start to sea when a boy, I had put a small sum in the hands\r\nof an aunt, and this my friend said I should do well to spend on my\r\nfarm. So when he got home he sent some of it in cash, and laid out the\r\nrest in cloth, stuffs, baize, and such like goods. My aunt had put a few\r\npounds in my friend's hands as a gift to him, to show her thanks for all\r\nthat he had done for me, and with this sum he was so kind as to buy me a\r\nslave. In the mean time I had bought a slave, so now I had two, and all\r\nwent on well for the next year.\r\n\r\nBut soon my plans grew too large for my means. One day some men came to\r\nask me to take charge of a slave ship to be sent out by them. They said\r\nthey would give me a share in the slaves, and pay the cost of the stock.\r\nThis would have been a good thing for me if I had not had farms and\r\nland; but it was wild and rash to think of it now, for I had made a\r\nlarge sum, and ought to have gone on in the same way for three or four\r\nyears more. Well, I told these men that I would go with all my heart, if\r\nthey would look to my farm in the mean time, which they said they would\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nSo I made my will, and went on board this ship on the same day on which,\r\neight years since, I had left Hull. She had six guns, twelve men, and a\r\nboy. We took with us saws, chains, toys, beads, bits of glass, and such\r\nlike ware, to suit the taste of those with whom we had to trade.\r\n\r\nWe were not more than twelve days from the Line, when a high wind took\r\nus off we knew not where. All at once there was a cry of \"Land!\" and the\r\nship struck on a bank of sand, in which she sank so deep that we could\r\nnot get her off. At last we found that we must make up our minds to\r\nleave her, and get to shore as well as we could. There had been a boat\r\nat her stern, but we found it had been torn off by the force of the\r\nwaves. One small boat was still left on the ship's side, so we got in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere we were all of us on the wild sea. The heart of each now grew\r\nfaint, our cheeks were pale, and our eyes were dim, for there was but\r\none hope, and that was to find some bay, and so get in the lee of the\r\nland. We now gave up our whole souls to God.\r\n\r\nThe sea grew more and more rough, and its white foam would curl and\r\nboil. At last the waves, in their wild sport, burst on the boat's side,\r\nand we were all thrown out.\r\n\r\nI could swim well, but the force of the waves made me lose my breath too\r\nmuch to do so. At length one large wave took me to the shore, and left\r\nme high and dry, though half dead with fear. I got on my feet and made\r\nthe best of my way for the land; but just then the curve of a huge wave\r\nrose up as high as a hill, and this I had no strength to keep from, so\r\nit took me back to the sea. I did my best to float on the top, and held\r\nmy breath to do so. The next wave was quite as high, and shut me up in\r\nits bulk. I held my hands down tight to my side, and then my head shot\r\nout at the top of the waves. This gave me heart and breath too, and soon\r\nmy feet felt the ground.\r\n\r\nI stood quite still for a short time, to let the sea run back from me,\r\nand then I set off with all my might to the shore, but yet the waves\r\ncaught me, and twice more did they take me back, and twice more land me\r\non the shore. I thought the last wave would have been the death of me,\r\nfor it drove me on a piece of rock, and with such force, as to leave me\r\nin a kind of swoon, which, thank God, did not last long. At length, to\r\nmy great joy, I got up to the cliffs close to the shore, where I found\r\nsome grass, out of the reach of the sea. There, I sat down, safe on land\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nI could but cry out in the words of the Psalm, \"They that go down to the\r\nsea in ships, these men see the works of the Lord in the deep. For at\r\nHis word the storms rise, the winds blow, and lift up the waves; then\r\ndo they mount to the sky, and from thence go down to the deep. My soul\r\nfaints, I reel to and fro, and am at my wit's end: then the Lord brings\r\nme out of all my fears.\"\r\n\r\nI felt so wrapt in joy, that all I could do was to walk up and down the\r\ncoast, now lift up my hands, now fold them on my breast, and thank God\r\nfor all that He had done for me, when the rest of the men were lost.\r\nAll lost but I, and I was safe! I now cast my eyes round me, to find out\r\nwhat kind of a place it was that I had been thus thrown in, like a bird\r\nin a storm. Then all the glee I felt at first left me; for I was wet and\r\ncold, and had no dry clothes to put on, no food to eat and not a friend\r\nto help me.\r\n\r\nThere were wild beasts here, but I had no gun to shoot them with, or to\r\nkeep me from their jaws. I had but a knife and a pipe. It now grew dark;\r\nand where was I to go for the night? I thought the top of some high tree\r\nwould be a good place to keep me out of harm's way; and that there I\r\nmight sit and think of death, for, as yet, I had no hopes of life. Well,\r\nI went to my tree, and made a kind of nest to sleep in. Then I cut a\r\nstick to keep off the beasts of prey, in case they should come, and fell\r\nto sleep just as if the branch I lay on had been a bed of down.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up it was broad day; the sky too was clear and the sea calm.\r\nBut I saw from the top of the tree that in the night the ship had left\r\nthe bank of sand, and lay but a mile from me; while the boat was on the\r\nbeach, two miles on my right. I went some way down by the shore, to get\r\nto the boat; but an arm of the sea, half a mile broad, kept me from\r\nit. At noon, the tide went a long way out, so that I could get near the\r\nship; and here I found that if we had but made up our minds to stay on\r\nboard, we should all have been safe.\r\n\r\nI shed tears at the thought, for I could not help it; yet, as there was\r\nno use in that, it struck me that the best thing for me to do was to\r\nswim to the ship. I soon threw off my clothes, took to the sea, and swam\r\nup to the wreck. But how was I to get on deck? I had swam twice round\r\nthe ship, when a piece of rope, caught my eye, which hung down from her\r\nside so low, that at first the waves hid it. By the help of this rope I\r\ngot on board. I found that there was a bulge in the ship, and that she\r\nhad sprung a leak. You may be sure that my first thought was to look\r\nround for some food, and I soon made my way to the bin, where the bread\r\nwas kept, and ate some of it as I went to and fro, for there was no time\r\nto lose. There was, too, some rum, of which I took a good draught, and\r\nthis gave me heart. What I stood most in need of, was a boat to take the\r\ngoods to shore. But it was vain to wish for that which could not be\r\nhad; and as there were some spare yards in the ship, two or three large\r\nplanks of wood, and a spare mast or two, I fell to work with these, to\r\nmake a raft.\r\n\r\nI put four spars side by side, and laid short bits of plank on them,\r\ncross ways, to make my raft strong. Though these planks would bear my\r\nown weight, they were too slight to bear much of my freight. So I took a\r\nsaw which was on board, and cut a mast in three lengths, and these gave\r\ngreat strength to the raft. I found some bread and rice, a Dutch cheese,\r\nand some dry goat's flesh. There had been some wheat, but the rats had\r\ngot at it, and it was all gone.\r\n\r\nMy next task was to screen my goods from the spray of the sea; and it\r\ndid not take me long to do this, for there were three large chests on\r\nboard which held all, and these I put on the raft. When the high tide\r\ncame up it took off my coat and shirt, which I had left on the shore;\r\nbut there were some fresh clothes in the ship.\r\n\r\n\"See here is a prize!\" said I, out loud, (though there were none to hear\r\nme), \"now I shall not starve.\" For I found four large guns. But how was\r\nmy raft to be got to land? I had no sail, no oars; and a gust of wind\r\nwould make all my store slide off. Yet there were three things which I\r\nwas glad of; a calm sea, a tide which set in to the shore, and a slight\r\nbreeze to blow me there.\r\n\r\nI had the good luck to find some oars in a part of the ship, in which\r\nI had made no search till now. With these I put to sea, and for half a\r\nmile my raft went well; but soon I found it drove to one side. At length\r\nI saw a creek, to which, with some toil, I took my raft; and now the\r\nbeach was so near, that I felt my oar touch the ground.\r\n\r\nHere I had well nigh lost my freight, for the shore lay on a slope, so\r\nthat there was no place to land on, save where one end of the raft would\r\nlie so high, and one end so low, that all my goods would fall off. To\r\nwait till the tide came up was all that could be done. So when the sea\r\nwas a foot deep, I thrust the raft on a flat piece of ground, to moor\r\nher there, and stuck my two oars in the sand, one on each side of the\r\nraft. Thus I let her lie till the ebb of the tide, and when it went\r\ndown, she was left safe on land with all her freight.\r\n\r\nI saw that there were birds on the isle, and I shot one of them. Mine\r\nmust have been the first gun that had been heard there since the world\r\nwas made; for at the sound of it, whole flocks of birds flew up, with\r\nloud cries, from all parts of the wood. The shape of the beak of the one\r\nI shot was like that of a hawk, but the claws were not so large.\r\n\r\nI now went back to my raft to land my stores, and this took up the rest\r\nof the day. What to do at night I knew not, nor where to find a safe\r\nplace to land my stores on. I did not like to lie down on the ground,\r\nfor fear of beasts of prey, as well as snakes, but there was no cause\r\nfor these fears, as I have since found. I put the chests and boards\r\nround me as well as I could, and made a kind of hut for the night.\r\n\r\nAs there was still a great store of things left in the ship, which would\r\nbe of use to me, I thought that I ought to bring them to land at once;\r\nfor I knew that the first storm would break up the ship. So I went on\r\nboard, and took good care this time not to load my raft too much.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, I sought for was the tool chest; and in it were some\r\nbags of nails, spikes, saws, knives, and such things: but best of all I\r\nfound a stone to grind my tools on. There were two or three flasks,\r\nsome large bags of shot, and a roll of lead; but this last I had not\r\nthe strength to hoist up to the ship's side, so as to get it on my raft.\r\nThere were some spare sails too which I brought to shore.\r\n\r\nI had some fear lest my stores might be run off with by beasts of prey,\r\nif not by men; but I found all safe and sound when I went back, and no\r\none had come there but a wild cat, which sat on one of the chests. When\r\nI came up I held my gun at her, but as she did not know what a gun was,\r\nthis did not rouse her. She ate a piece of dry goat's flesh, and then\r\ntook her leave.\r\n\r\nNow that I had two freights of goods at hand, I made a tent with the\r\nship's sails, to stow them in, and cut the poles for it from the wood.\r\nI now took all the things out of the casks and chests, and put the casks\r\nin piles round the tent, to give it strength; and when this was done,\r\nI shut up the door with the boards, spread one of the beds (which I had\r\nbrought from the ship) on the ground, laid two guns close to my head,\r\nand went to bed for the first time. I slept all night, for I was much in\r\nneed of rest.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was sad and sick at heart, for I felt how dull it was to\r\nbe thus cut off from all the rest of the world. I had no great wish for\r\nwork: but there was too much to be done for me to dwell long on my sad\r\nlot. Each day as it came, I went off to the wreck to fetch more things;\r\nand I brought back as much as the raft would hold. One day I had put too\r\ngreat a load on the raft, which made it sink down on one side, so that\r\nthe goods were lost in the sea; but at this I did not fret, as the chief\r\npart of the freight was some rope, which would not have been of much use\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nThe twelve days that I had been in the isle were spent in this way, and\r\nI had brought to land all that one pair of hands could lift; though if\r\nthe sea had been still calm, I might have brought the whole ship, piece\r\nby piece.\r\n\r\nThe last time I swam to the wreck, the wind blew so hard, that I made up\r\nmy mind to go on board next time at low tide. I found some tea and some\r\ngold coin; but as to the gold, it made me laugh to look at it. \"O drug!\"\r\nsaid I, \"Thou art of no use to me! I care not to save thee. Stay where\r\nthou art, till the ship go down, then go thou with it!\"\r\n\r\nStill, I thought I might as well just take it; so I put it in a piece\r\nof the sail, and threw it on deck that I might place it on the raft.\r\nBye-and-bye, the wind blew from the shore, so I had to swim back with\r\nall speed; for I knew that at the turn of the tide, I should find it\r\nhard work to get to land at all. But in spite of the high wind, I came\r\nto my home all safe. At dawn of day I put my head out, and cast my eyes\r\non the sea. When lo! no ship was there!\r\n\r\nThis change in the face of things, and the loss of such a friend, quite\r\nstruck me down. Yet I was glad to think that I had brought to shore all\r\nthat could be of use to me. I had now to look out for some spot where I\r\ncould make my home. Half way up a hill there was a small plain, four or\r\nfive score feet long, and twice as broad; and as it had a full view of\r\nthe sea, I thought that it would be a good place for my house.\r\n\r\nI first dug a trench round a space which took in twelve yards; and in\r\nthis I drove two rows of stakes, till they stood firm like piles, five\r\nand a half feet from the ground. I made the stakes close and tight with\r\nbits of rope; and put small sticks on the top of them in the shape of\r\nspikes. This made so strong a fence that no man or beast could get in.\r\n\r\nThe door of my house was on the top, and I had to climb up to it by\r\nsteps, which I took in with me, so that no one else might come up by the\r\nsame way. Close to the back of the house stood a high rock, in which I\r\nmade a cave, and laid all the earth that I had dug out of it round my\r\nhouse, to the height of a foot and a half. I had to go out once a day in\r\nsearch of food. The first time, I saw some goats, but they were too shy\r\nand swift of foot, to let me get near them.\r\n\r\nAt last I lay in wait for them close to their own haunts. If they saw\r\nme in the vale, though they might be on high ground, they would run off,\r\nwild with fear; but if they were in the vale, and I on high ground, they\r\ntook no heed of me. The first goat I shot had a kid by her side, and\r\nwhen the old one fell, the kid stood near her, till I took her off on\r\nmy back, and then the young one ran by my side. I put down the goat, and\r\nbrought the kid home to tame it; but as it was too young to feed, I had\r\nto kill it.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought that, for the lack of pen and ink, I should lose all\r\nnote of time; so I made a large post, in the shape of a cross, on which\r\nI cut these words, \"I came on these shores on the 8th day of June, in\r\nthe year 1659\" On the side of this post I made a notch each day as it\r\ncame, and this I kept up till the last.\r\n\r\nI have not yet said a word of my four pets, which were two cats, a dog,\r\nand a bird. You may guess how fond I was of them, for they were all the\r\nfriends left to me. I brought the dog and two cats from the ship. The\r\ndog would fetch things for me at all times, and by his bark, his whine,\r\nhis growl, and his tricks, he would all but talk to me; yet he could not\r\ngive me thought for thought.\r\n\r\nIf I could but have had some one near me to find fault with, or to find\r\nfault with me, what a treat it would have been! Now that I had brought\r\nink from the ship, I wrote down a sketch of each day as it came; not so\r\nmuch to leave to those who might read it, when I was dead and gone, as\r\nto get rid of my own thoughts, and draw me from the fears which all day\r\nlong dwelt on my mind, till my head would ache with the weight of them.\r\n\r\nI was a long way out of the course of ships: and oh, how dull it was to\r\nbe cast on this lone spot with no one to love, no one to make me laugh,\r\nno one to make me weep, no one to make me think. It was dull to roam,\r\nday by day, from the wood to the shore; and from the shore back to the\r\nwood, and feed on my own thoughts all the while.\r\n\r\nSo much for the sad view of my case; but like most things it had a\r\nbright side as well as a dark one. For here was I safe on land, while\r\nall the rest of the ship's crew were lost. Well, thought I, God who\r\nshapes our ways, and led me by the hand then, can save me from this\r\nstate now, or send some one to be with me; true, I am cast on a rough\r\nand rude part of the globe, but there are no beasts of prey on it to\r\nkill or hurt me. God has sent the ship so near to me, that I have got\r\nfrom it all things to meet my wants for the rest of my days. Let life be\r\nwhat it may, there is sure to be much to thank God for; and I soon gave\r\nup all dull thoughts, and did not so much as look out for a sail.\r\n\r\nMy goods from the wreck had been in the cave for more than ten months;\r\nand it was time now to put them right, as they took up all the space,\r\nand left me no room to turn in: so I made my small cave a large one, and\r\ndug it out a long way back in the sand rock. Then I brought the mouth of\r\nit up to the fence, and so made a back way to my house. This done, I put\r\nshelves on each side, to hold my goods, which made my cave look like a\r\nshop full of stores. To make these shelves I cut down a tree, and with\r\nthe help of a saw, an axe, a plane, and some more tools, I made boards.\r\n\r\nA chair, and a desk to write on, came next. I rose in good time, and set\r\nto work till noon, then I ate my meal, then I went out with my gun, and\r\nto work once more till the sun had set; and then to bed. It took me more\r\nthan a week to change the shape and size of my cave, but I had made it\r\nfar too large; for in course of time the earth fell in from the roof;\r\nand had I been in it, when this took place, I should have lost my life.\r\nI had now to set up posts in my cave, with planks on the top of them, so\r\nas to make a roof of wood.\r\n\r\nOne day, when out with my gun, I shot a wild cat, the skin of which made\r\nme a cap; and I found some birds of the dove tribe, which built their\r\nnests in the holes of rocks.\r\n\r\nI had to go to bed at dusk, till I made a lamp of goat's fat, which I\r\nput in a clay dish; and this, with a piece of hemp for a wick, made a\r\ngood light. As I had found a use for the bag which had held the fowl's\r\nfood on board ship, I shook out from it the husks of corn. This was just\r\nat the time when the great rains fell, and in the course of a month,\r\nblades of rice, corn, and rye, sprang up. As time went by, and the grain\r\nwas ripe, I kept it, and took care to sow it each year; but I could not\r\nboast of a crop of wheat, as will be shown bye-and-bye, for three years.\r\n\r\nA thing now took place on the isle, which no one could have dreamt of,\r\nand which struck me down with fear. It was this--the ground shook\r\nwith great force, which threw down earth from the rock with a loud\r\ncrash--once more there was a shock--and now the earth fell from the roof\r\nof my cave. The sea did not look the same as it had done, for the shocks\r\nwere just as strong there as on land. The sway of the earth made me feel\r\nsick; and there was a noise and a roar all around me. The same kind of\r\nshock came a third time; and when it had gone off, I sat quite still on\r\nthe ground, for I knew not what to do. Then the clouds grew dark, the\r\nwind rose, trees were torn up by the roots, the sea was a mass of foam\r\nand froth, and a great part of the isle was laid waste with the storm. I\r\nthought that the world had come to an end. In three hours' time all was\r\ncalm; but rain fell all that night, and a great part of the next day.\r\nNow, though quite worn out, I had to move my goods which were in the\r\ncave, to some safe place.\r\n\r\nI knew that tools would be my first want, and that I should have to\r\ngrind mine on the stone, as they were blunt and worn with use. But as it\r\ntook both hands to hold the tool, I could not turn the stone; so I made\r\na wheel by which I could move it with my foot. This was no small task,\r\nbut I took great pains with it, and at length it was done.\r\n\r\nThe rain fell for some days and a cold chill came on me; in short I was\r\nill. I had pains in my head, and could get no sleep at night, and my\r\nthoughts were wild and strange. At one time I shook with cold, and then\r\na hot fit came on, with faint sweats, which would last six hours at a\r\ntime. Ill as I was, I had to go out with my gun to get food. I shot a\r\ngoat, but it was a great toil to bring it home, and still more to cook\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI spent the next day in bed, and felt half dead from thirst, yet too\r\nweak to stand up to get some drink. I lay and wept like a child. \"Lord\r\nlook on me! Lord look on me!\" would I cry for hours.\r\n\r\nAt last the fit left me, and I slept, and did not wake till dawn. I\r\ndreamt that I lay on the ground, and saw a man come down from a great\r\nblack cloud in a flame of light. When he stood on the earth, it shook as\r\nit had done a few days since; and all the world to me was full of fire.\r\nHe came up and said \"As I see that all these things have not brought\r\nthee to pray, now thou shalt die.\" Then I woke, and found it was a\r\ndream. Weak and faint, I was in dread all day lest my fit should come\r\non.\r\n\r\nToo ill to get out with my gun, I sat on the shore to think, and thus\r\nran my thoughts: \"What is this sea which is all round me? and whence is\r\nit? There can be no doubt that the hand that made it, made the air, the\r\nearth, the sky. And who is that? It is God who hath made all things.\r\nWell then, if God hath made all things, it must be He who guides them;\r\nand if so, no one thing in the whole range of His works can take place,\r\nand He not know it. Then God must know how sick and sad I am, and He\r\nwills me to be here. O, why hath God done this to me!\"\r\n\r\nThen some voice would seem to say, \"Dost thou ask why God hath done this\r\nto thee? Ask why thou wert not shot by the Moors, who came on board the\r\nship, and took the lives of thy mates. Ask why thou wert not torn by the\r\nbeasts of prey on the coasts. Ask why thou didst not go down in the\r\ndeep sea with the rest of the crew, but didst come to this isle, and art\r\nsafe.\"\r\n\r\nA sound sleep then fell on me, and when I woke it must have been three\r\no'clock the next day, by the rays of the sun: nay, it may have been more\r\nthan that; for I think that this must have been the day that I did not\r\nmark on my post, as I have since found that there was one notch too few.\r\n\r\nI now took from my store the Book of God's Word, which I had brought\r\nfrom the wreck, not one page, of which I had yet read. My eyes fell on\r\nfive words, that would seem to have been put there for my good at this\r\ntime; so well did they cheer my faint hopes, and touch the true source\r\nof my fears. They were these: \"I will not leave thee.\" And they have\r\ndwelt in my heart to this day. I laid down the book, to pray. My cry was\r\n\"O, Lord, help me to love and learn thy ways.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first time in all my life that I had felt a sense that God\r\nwas near, and heard me. As for my dull life here, it was not worth a\r\nthought; for now a new strength had come to me; and there was a change\r\nin my griefs, as well as in my joys.\r\n\r\nI had now been in the isle twelve months, and I thought it was time to\r\ngo all round it, in search of its woods, springs, and creeks. So I set\r\noff, and brought back with me limes and grapes in their prime, large and\r\nripe. I had hung the grapes in the sun to dry, and in a few days' time\r\nwent to fetch them, that I might lay up a store. The vale, on the banks\r\nof which they grew, was fresh and green, and a clear, bright stream ran\r\nthrough it, which gave so great a charm to the spot, as to make me wish\r\nto live there.\r\n\r\nBut there was no view of the sea from this vale, while from my house, no\r\nships could come on my side of the isle, and not be seen by me; yet the\r\ncool, soft banks were so sweet and new to me that much of my time was\r\nspent there.\r\n\r\nIn the first of the three years in which I had grown corn, I had sown\r\nit too late; in the next, it was spoilt by the drought; but the third\r\nyears' crop had sprung up well.\r\n\r\nI found that the hares would lie in it night and day, for which there\r\nwas no cure but to plant a thick hedge all round it; and this took me\r\nmore than three weeks to do. I shot the hares in the day time; and when\r\nit grew dark, I made fast the dog's chain to the gate, and there he\r\nstood to bark all night.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the corn grew strong, and at last ripe but, just as the\r\nhares had hurt it in the blade, so now the birds ate it in the ear. At\r\nthe noise of my gun, whole flocks of them would fly up; and at this rate\r\nI saw that there would be no corn left; so I made up my mind to keep a\r\nlook out night and day. I hid by the side of a hedge, and could see the\r\nbirds sit on the trees and watch, and then come down, one by one, at\r\nfirst. Now each grain of wheat was, as it were, a small loaf of bread to\r\nme. So the great thing was to get rid of these birds. My plan was this,\r\nI shot three, and hung them up, like thieves, to scare all that came to\r\nthe corn; and from this time, as long as the dead ones hung there, not\r\na bird came near. When the corn was ripe, I made a scythe out of the\r\nswords from the ship, and got in my crop.\r\n\r\nFew of us think of the cost at which a loaf of bread is made. Of course,\r\nthere was no plough here to turn up the earth, and no spade to dig it\r\nwith, so I made one with wood; but this was soon worn out, and for want\r\nof a rake, I made use of the bough of a tree. When I had got the corn\r\nhome, I had to thrash it, part the grain from the chaff, and store it\r\nup. Then came the want of a mill to grind it, of sieves to clean it, and\r\nof yeast to make bread of it.\r\n\r\nStill, my bread was made, though I had no tools; and no one could say\r\nthat I did not earn it, by the sweat of my brow. When the rain kept me\r\nin doors, it was good fun to teach my pet bird Poll to talk; but so mute\r\nwere all things round me, that the sound of my own voice made me start.\r\n\r\nMy chief wants now were jars, pots, cups, and plates, but I knew not how\r\nI could make them. At last I went in search of some clay, and found some\r\na mile from my house; but it was quite a joke to see the queer shapes\r\nand forms that I made out of it. For some of my pots and jars were too\r\nweak to bear their own weight; and they would fall out here, and in\r\nthere, in all sorts of ways; while some, when they were put in the sun\r\nto bake, would crack with the heat of its rays. You may guess what my\r\njoy was when at last a pot was made which would stand the heat of the\r\nfire, so that I could boil the meat for broth.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be made was a sieve, to part the grain from the husks.\r\nGoat's hair was of no use to me, as I could not weave or spin; so I made\r\na shift for two years with a thin kind of stuff, which I had brought\r\nfrom the ship. But to grind the corn with the stones was the worst of\r\nall, such hard work did I find it. To bake the bread I burnt some wood\r\ndown to an ash, which I threw on the hearth to heat it, and then set my\r\nloaves on the hearth, and in this way my bread was made.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to turn my thoughts to was the ship's boat, which lay on\r\nthe high ridge of sand, where it had been thrust by the storm which had\r\ncast me on these shores. But it lay with the keel to the sky, so I had\r\nto dig the sand from it, and turn it up with the help of a pole. When I\r\nhad done this I found it was all in vain, for I had not the strength to\r\nlaunch it. So all I could do now, was to make a boat of less size out\r\nof a tree; and I found one that was just fit for it, which grew not far\r\nfrom the shore, but I could no more stir this than I could the ship's\r\nboat. What was to be done? I first dug the ground flat and smooth all\r\nthe way from the boat to the sea, so as to let it slide down; but this\r\nplan did not turn out well, so I thought I would try a new way, which\r\nwas to make a trench, so as to bring the sea up to the boat, as the boat\r\ncould not be brought to the sea. But to do this, I must have dug down to\r\na great depth, which would take one man some years to do. And when too\r\nlate, I found it was not wise to work out a scheme, till I had first\r\nthought of the cost and toil.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" thought I, \"I must give up the boat, and with it all my hopes\r\nto leave the isle. But I have this to think of: I am lord of the whole\r\nisle; in fact, a king. I have wood with which I might build a fleet, and\r\ngrapes, if not corn, to freight it with, though all my wealth is but a\r\nfew gold coins.\" For these I had no sort of use, and could have found it\r\nin my heart to give them all for a peck of peas and some ink, which last\r\nI stood much in need of. But it was best to dwell more on what I had,\r\nthan on what I had not.\r\n\r\nI now must needs try once more to build a boat, but this time it was to\r\nhave a mast, for which the ship's sails would be of great use. I made a\r\ndeck at each end, to keep out the spray of the sea, a bin for my food,\r\nand a rest for my gun, with a flap to screen it from the wet. More than\r\nall, the boat was one of such a size that I could launch it.\r\n\r\nMy first cruise was up and down the creek, but soon I got bold, and made\r\nthe whole round of my isle. I took with me bread, cakes, and a pot full\r\nof rice, some rum, half a goat, two great coats, one of which was to\r\nlie on, and one to put on at night. I set sail in the sixth year of my\r\nreign. On the East side of the isle, there was a large ridge of rocks,\r\nwhich lay two miles from the shore; and a shoal of sand lay for half a\r\nmile from the rocks to the beach. To get round to this point, I had to\r\nsail a great way out to sea; and here I all but lost my life.\r\n\r\nBut I got back to my home at last. On my way there, quite worn out with\r\nthe toils of the boat, I lay down in the shade to rest my limbs, and\r\nslept. But judge, if you can, what a start I gave, when a voice woke\r\nme out of my sleep, and spoke my name three times! A voice in this wild\r\nplace! To call me by name, too! Then the voice said, \"Where are you?\r\nWhere have you been? How came you here?\" But now I saw it all; for at\r\nthe top of the hedge sat Poll, who did but say the words she had been\r\ntaught by me.\r\n\r\nI now went in search of some goats, and laid snares for them, with rice\r\nfor a bait I had set the traps in the night, and found they had all\r\nstood, though the bait was gone. So I thought of a new way to take them,\r\nwhich was to make a pit and lay sticks and grass on it, so as to hide\r\nit; and in this way I caught an old goat and some kids. But the old goat\r\nwas much too fierce for me, so I let him go. I brought all the young\r\nones home, and let them fast a long time, till at last they fed from my\r\nhand, and were quite tame. I kept them in a kind of park, in which there\r\nwere trees to screen them from the sun. At first my park was three miles\r\nround; but it struck me that, in so great a space, the kids would soon\r\nget as wild as if they had the range of the whole vale, and that it\r\nwould be as well to give them less room; so I had to make a hedge which\r\ntook me three months to plant. My park held a flock of twelve goats, and\r\nin two years more there were more than two score.\r\n\r\nMy dog sat at meals with me, and one cat on each side of me, on stools,\r\nand we had Poll to talk to us. Now for a word or two as to the dress in\r\nwhich I made a tour round the isle. I could but think how droll it would\r\nlook in the streets of the town in which I was born. I wore a high cap\r\nof goat's skin, with a flap that hung, down, to keep the sun and rain\r\nfrom my neck, a coat made from the skin of a goat too, the skirts of\r\nwhich came down to my hips, and the same on my legs, with no shoes, but\r\nflaps of the fur round my shins. I had a broad belt of the same round\r\nmy waist, which drew on with two thongs; and from it, on my right side,\r\nhung a saw and an axe; and on my left side a pouch for the shot. My\r\nbeard had not been cut since I came here. But no more need be said of\r\nmy looks, for there were few to see me. A strange sight was now in store\r\nfor me, which was to change the whole course of my life in the isle.\r\n\r\nOne day at noon, while on a stroll down to a part of the shore that was\r\nnew to me, what should I see on the sand but the print of a man's foot!\r\nI felt as if I was bound by a spell, and could not stir from, the spot.\r\n\r\nBye-and-bye, I stole a look round me, but no one was in sight, What\r\ncould this mean? I went three or four times to look at it. There it\r\nwas--the print of a man's foot; toes, heel, and all the parts of a foot.\r\nHow could it have come there?\r\n\r\nMy head swam with fear; and as I left the spot, I made two or three\r\nsteps, and then took a look round me; then two steps more, and did the\r\nsame thing. I took fright at the stump of an old tree, and ran to my\r\nhouse, as if for my life. How could aught in the shape of a man come to\r\nthat shore, and I not know it? Where was the ship that brought him? Then\r\na vague dread took hold of my mind, that some man, or set of men, had\r\nfound me out; and it might be, that they meant to kill me, or rob me of\r\nall I had.\r\n\r\nHow strange a thing is the life of man! One day we love that which the\r\nnext day we hate. One day we seek what the next day we shun. One day\r\nwe long for the thing which the next day we fear; and so we go on. Now,\r\nfrom the time that I was cast on this isle, my great source of grief\r\nwas that I should be thus cut off from the rest of my race. Why, then,\r\nshould the thought that a man might be near give me all this pain? Nay,\r\nwhy should the mere sight of the print of a man's foot, make me quake\r\nwith fear? It seems most strange; yet not more strange than true.\r\n\r\nOnce it struck me that it might be the print of my own foot, when first\r\nthe storm cast me on these shores. Could I have come this way from the\r\nboat? Should it in truth turn out to be the print of my own foot, I\r\nshould be like a boy who tells of a ghost, and feels more fright at his\r\nown tale, than those do whom he meant to scare.\r\n\r\nFear kept me in-doors for three days, till the want of food drove me\r\nout. At last I was so bold as to go down to the coast to look once more\r\nat the print of the foot, to see if it was the same shape as my own. I\r\nfound it was not so large by a great deal; so it was clear there were\r\nmen in the isle. Just at this time my good watch dog fell down dead at\r\nmy feet. He was old and worn out, and in him I lost my best guard and\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nOne day as I went from the hill to the coast, a scene lay in front of me\r\nwhich made me sick at heart. The spot was spread with the bones of men.\r\nThere was a round place dug in the earth, where a fire had been made,\r\nand here some men had come to feast. Now that I had seen this sight, I\r\nknew not how to act; I kept close to my home, and would scarce stir from\r\nit, save to milk my flock of goats.\r\n\r\nTo feel safe was now more to me than to be well fed; and I did not care\r\nto drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood, lest the sound of it should be\r\nheard, much less would I fire a gun. As to my bread and meat, I had to\r\nbake it at night when the smoke could not be seen. But I soon found the\r\nway to burn wood with turf at the top of it, which made it like chark,\r\nor dry coal; and this I could use by day, as it had no smoke.\r\n\r\nI found in the wood where I went to get the sticks for my fire, a cave\r\nso large that I could stand in it; but I made more haste to get out,\r\nthan in; for two large eyes, as bright as stars, shone out from it with\r\na fierce glare. I took a torch, and went to see what they could be, and\r\nfound that there was no cause for fear; for the eyes were those of an\r\nold gray goat, which had gone there to die of old age. I gave him a\r\npush, to try to get him out of the cave, but he could not rise from the\r\nground where he lay; so I left him there to die, as I could not save his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nI found the width of the cave was twelve feet; but part of it, near the\r\nend, was so low that I had to creep on my hands and feet to go in. What\r\nthe length of it was I could not tell, for my light went out, and I had\r\nto give up my search. The next day, I went to the cave with large lights\r\nmade of goat's fat; and when I got to the end, I found that the roof\r\nrose to two score feet or more.\r\n\r\nAs my lights shone on the walls and roof of the cave, a sight burst on\r\nmy view, the charms of which no tongue could tell; for the walls shone\r\nlike stars. What was in the rock to cause this it was hard to say; they\r\nmight be gems, or bright stones, or gold. But let them be what they may,\r\nthis cave was a mine of wealth to me; for at such time as I felt dull\r\nor sad, the bright scene would flash on my mind's eye, and fill it with\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nA score of years had gone by, with no new sight to rest my eyes on, till\r\nthis scene burst on them. I felt as if I should like to spend the rest\r\nof my life here; and at its close, lie down to die in this cave, like\r\nthe old goat.\r\n\r\nAs I went home I was struck by the sight of some smoke, which came from\r\na fire no more than two miles off. From this time I lost all my peace\r\nof mind. Day and night a dread would haunt me, that the men who had made\r\nthis fire would find me out. I went home and drew up my steps, but first\r\nI made all things round me look wild and rude. To load my gun was the\r\nnext thing to do, and I thought it would be best to stay at home and\r\nhide.\r\n\r\nBut this was not to be borne long. I had no spy to send out and all I\r\ncould do was to get to the top of the hill, and keep a good look out. At\r\nlast, through my glass, I could see a group of wild men join in a dance\r\nround their fire. As soon a they had left, I took two guns, and slung a\r\nsword on my side; then with all speed, I set off to the top of the hill,\r\nonce more to have a good view.\r\n\r\nThis time I made up my mind to go up to the men, but not with a view to\r\nkill them, for I felt that it would be wrong to do so. With such a load\r\nof arms, it took me two hours to reach the spot where the fire was; and\r\nby the time I got there, the men had all gone; but I saw them in four\r\nboats out at sea.\r\n\r\nDown on the shore, there was a proof of what the work of these men had\r\nbeen. The signs of their feast made me sick at heart, and I shut my\r\neyes. I durst not fire my gun when I went out for food on that side the\r\nisle, lest there should be some of the men left, who might hear it,\r\nand so find me out. This state of things went on for a year and three\r\nmonths, and for all that time I saw no more men.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of May, a great storm of wind blew all day and night. As\r\nit was dark, I sat in my house; and in the midst of the gale, I heard\r\na gun fire! My guess was that it must have been from some ship cast on\r\nshore by the storm. So I set a light to some wood on top of the hill,\r\nthat those in the ship, if ship it should be, might know that some one\r\nwas there to aid them. I then heard two more guns fire. When it was\r\nlight, I went to the South side of the isle, and there lay the wreck of\r\na ship, cast on the rocks in the night by the storm. She was too far off\r\nfor me to see if there were men on board.\r\n\r\nWords could not tell how much I did long to bring but one of the ship's\r\ncrew to the shore! So strong was my wish to save the life of those on\r\nboard, that I could have laid down my own life to do so. There are some\r\nsprings in the heart which, when hope stirs them, drive the soul on with\r\nsuch a force, that to lose all chance of the thing one hopes for, would\r\nseem to make one mad; and thus was it with me.\r\n\r\nNow, I thought, was the time to use my boat; so I set to work at once to\r\nfit it out. I took on board some rum (of which I still had a good deal\r\nleft), some dry grapes, a bag of rice, some goat's milk, and cheese, and\r\nthen put out to sea. A dread came on me at the thought of the risk I had\r\nrun on the same rocks; but my heart did not quite fail me, though I\r\nknew that, as my boat was small, if a gale of wind should spring up, all\r\nwould be lost. Then I found that I must go back to the shore till the\r\ntide should turn, and the ebb come on.\r\n\r\nI made up my mind to go out the next day with the high tide, so I slept\r\nthat night in my boat. At dawn I set out to sea, and in less than two\r\nhours I came up to the wreck. What a scene was there! The ship had\r\nstruck on two rocks. The stern was torn by the force of the waves, the\r\nmasts were swept off, ropes and chains lay strewn on the deck, and all\r\nwas wrapt in gloom. As I came up to the wreck, a dog swam to me with a\r\nyelp and a whine. I took him on board my boat, and when I gave him some\r\nbread he ate it like a wolf, and as to drink, he would have burst, if I\r\nhad let him take his fill of it.\r\n\r\nI went to the cook's room, where I found two men, but they were both\r\ndead. The tongue was mute, the ear was deaf, the eye was shut, and the\r\nlip was stiff; still the sad tale was told, for each had his arm round\r\nhis friend's neck, and so they must have sat to wait for death. What a\r\nchange had come on the scene, once so wild with the lash of the waves\r\nand the roar of the wind! All was calm now--death had done its work,\r\nand all had felt its stroke, save the dog, and he was the one thing that\r\nstill had life.\r\n\r\nI thought the ship must have come from Spain, and there was much gold\r\non board. I took some of the chests and put them in my boat, but did not\r\nwait to see what they held, and with this spoil, and three casks of rum,\r\nI came back.\r\n\r\nI found all things at home just as I had left them, my goats, my cats,\r\nand my bird. The scene in the cook's room was in my mind day and night,\r\nand to cheer me up I drank some of the rum. I then set to work to bring\r\nmy freight from the shore, where I had left it. In the chests were two\r\ngreat bags of gold, and some bars of the same, and near these lay three\r\nsmall flasks and three bags of shot which were a great prize.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, all went well with me for two years; but it was not to\r\nlast. One day, as I stood on the hill, I saw six boats on the shore!\r\nWhat could this mean?\r\n\r\nWhere were the men who had brought them? And what had they come for? I\r\nsaw through my glass that there were a score and a half, at least, on\r\nthe east side of the isle. They had meat on the fire, round which I\r\ncould see them dance. They then took a man from one of the boats, who\r\nwas bound hand and foot; but when they came to loose his bonds, he set\r\noff as fast as his feet would take him, and in a straight line to my\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, when I saw all the rest of the men run to catch him,\r\nmy hair stood on end with fright. In the creek, he swam like a fish, and\r\nthe plunge which he took brought him through it in a few strokes. All\r\nthe men now gave up the chase but two, and they swam through the creek,\r\nbut by no means so fast as the slave had done. Now, I thought, was the\r\ntime for me to help the poor man, and my heart told me it would be right\r\nto do so. I ran down my steps with my two guns, and went with all speed\r\nup the hill, and then down by a short cut to meet them.\r\n\r\nI gave a sign to the poor slave to come to me, and at the same time went\r\nup to meet the two men, who were in chase of him. I made a rush at the\r\nfirst of these, to knock him down with the stock of my gun, and he fell.\r\nI saw the one who was left, aim at me with his bow, so, to save my life,\r\nI shot him dead.\r\n\r\nThe smoke and noise from my gun, gave the poor slave who had been bound,\r\nsuch a shock, that he stood still on the spot, as if he had been in a\r\ntrance. I gave a loud shout for him to come to me, and I took care to\r\nshow him that I was a friend, and made all the signs I could think of to\r\ncoax him up to me. At length he came, knelt down to kiss the ground, and\r\nthen took hold of my foot, and set it on his head. All this meant that\r\nhe was my slave; and I bade him rise, and made much of him.\r\n\r\nBut there was more work to be done yet; for the man who had had the blow\r\nfrom my gun was not dead. I made a sign for my slave (as I shall now\r\ncall him) to look at him. At this he spoke to me, and though I could\r\nnot make out what he said, yet it gave me a shock of joy; for it was the\r\nfirst sound of a man's voice that I had heard, for all the years I had\r\nbeen on the isle.\r\n\r\nThe man whom I had struck with the stock of my gun, sat up; and my\r\nslave, who was in great fear of him, made signs for me to lend him my\r\nsword, which hung in a belt at my side. With this he ran up to the man,\r\nand with one stroke cut off his head. When he had done this, he brought\r\nme back my sword with a laugh, and put it down in front of me. I did not\r\nlike to see the glee with which he did it, and I did not feel that my\r\nown life was quite safe with such a man.\r\n\r\nHe, in his turn, could but lift up his large brown hands with awe, to\r\nthink that I had put his foe to death, while I stood so far from him.\r\nBut as to the sword, he and the rest of his tribe made use of swords of\r\nwood, and this was why he knew so well how to wield mine. He made signs\r\nto me to let him go and see the man who had been shot; and he gave him a\r\nturn round, first on this side, then on that; and when he saw the wound\r\nmade in his breast by the shot, he stood quite, still once more, as if\r\nhe had lost his wits. I made signs for him to come back, for my fears\r\ntold me that the rest of the men might come in search of their friends.\r\n\r\nI did not like to take my slave to my house, nor to my cave; so I threw\r\ndown some straw from the rice plant for him to sleep on, and gave him\r\nsome bread and a bunch of dry grapes to eat. He was a fine man, with\r\nstraight strong limbs, tall, and young. His hair was thick, like wool,\r\nand black. His head was large and high; and he had bright black eyes. He\r\nwas of a dark brown hue; his face was round, and his nose small, but\r\nnot flat; he had a good mouth with thin lips, with which he could give a\r\nsoft smile; and his teeth were as white as snow.\r\n\r\nI had been to milk my goats in the field close by, and when he saw me,\r\nhe ran to me, and lay down on the ground to show me his thanks. He then\r\nput his head on the ground, and set my foot on his head, as he had done\r\nat first. He took all the means he could think of, to let me know that\r\nhe would serve me all his life; and I gave a sign to show that I thought\r\nwell of him. The next thing was to think of some name to call him by.\r\nI chose that of the sixth day of the week (Friday), as he came to me on\r\nthat day. I took care not to lose sight of him all that night, and when\r\nthe sun rose, I made signs for him to come to me, that I might give him\r\nsome clothes, for he wore none. We then went up to the top of the hill,\r\nto look out for the men; but as we could not see them, or their boats,\r\nit was clear that they had left the isle.\r\n\r\nMy slave has since told me that they had had a great fight with the\r\ntribe that dwelt next to them; and that all those men whom each side\r\ntook in war were their own by right. My slave's foes had four who fell\r\nto their share, of whom he was one.\r\n\r\nI now set to work to make my man a cap of hare's skin, and gave him a\r\ngoat's skin to wear round his waist. It was a great source of pride to\r\nhim, to find that his clothes were as good as my own.\r\n\r\nAt night, I kept my guns, sword, and bow close to my side; but there was\r\nno need for this, as my slave was, in sooth, most true to me. He did all\r\nthat he was set to do, with his whole heart in the work; and I knew that\r\nhe would lay down his life to save mine. What could a man do more than\r\nthat? And oh, the joy to have him here to cheer me in this lone isle!\r\n\r\nI did my best to teach him, so like a child as he was, to do and feel\r\nall that was right, I found him apt, and full of fun; and he took great\r\npains to learn all that I could tell him. Our lives ran on in a calm,\r\nsmooth way; and, but for the vile feasts which were held on the shores,\r\nI felt no wish to leave the isle.\r\n\r\nAs my slave had by no means lost his zest for these meals, it struck me\r\nthat the best way to cure him, was to let him taste the flesh of beasts;\r\nso I took him with me one day to the wood for some sport. I saw a\r\nshe-goat, in the shade, with her two kids. I caught Friday by the arm,\r\nand made signs to him not to stir, and then shot one of the kids; but\r\nthe noise of the gun gave the poor man a great shock. He did not see the\r\nkid, nor did he know that it was dead. He tore his dress off his breast\r\nto feel if there was a wound there; then he knelt down to me, and took\r\nhold of my knees to pray of me not to kill him.\r\n\r\nTo show poor Friday that his life was quite safe, I led him by the hand,\r\nand told him to fetch the kid. By and by, I saw a hawk in a tree, so I\r\nbade him look at the gun, the hawk, and the ground; and then I shot the\r\nbird. But my poor slave gave still more signs of fear this time, than he\r\ndid at first: for he shook from head to foot. He must have thought that\r\nsome fiend of death dwelt in the gun, and I think that he would have\r\nknelt down to it, as well as to me; but he would not so much as touch\r\nthe gun for some time, though he would speak to it when he thought I was\r\nnot near. Once he told me that what he said to it was to ask it not to\r\nkill him.\r\n\r\nI brought home the bird, and made broth of it. Friday was much struck\r\nto see me eat salt with it, and made a wry face; but I, in my turn, took\r\nsome that had no salt with it, and I made a wry face at that. The next\r\nday I gave him a piece of kid's flesh, which I had hung by a string in\r\nfront of the fire to roast. My plan was to put two poles, one on each\r\nside of the fire, and a stick, on the top of them to hold the string.\r\nWhen my slave came to taste the flesh, he took the best means to let me\r\nknow how good he thought it.\r\n\r\nThe next day I set him to beat out and sift some corn. I let him see me\r\nmake the bread, and he soon did all the work. I felt quite a love for\r\nhis true, warm heart, and he soon learnt to talk to me. One day I said,\r\n\"Do the men of your tribe win in fight?\" He told me, with a smile, that\r\nthey did. \"Well, then,\" said I, \"How came they to let their foes take\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"They run one, two, three, and make go in the boat that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what do the men do with those they take?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat them all up.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not good news for me, but I went on, and said, \"Where do they\r\ntake them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to next place where they think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, they come here, come else place too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been here with them twice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, come there.\"\r\n\r\nHe meant the North West side of the isle, so to this spot I took him the\r\nnext day. He knew the place, and told me he was there once with a score\r\nof men. To let me know this, he put a score of stones all of a row, and\r\nmade me count them.\r\n\r\n\"Are not the boats lost on your shore now and then?\" He said that there\r\nwas no fear, and that no boats were lost. He told me that up a great way\r\nby the moon--that is where the moon then came up--there dwelt a tribe\r\nof white men like me, with beards. I felt sure that they must have come\r\nfrom Spain, to work the gold mines. I put this to him: \"Could I go from\r\nthis isle and join those men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, you may go in two boats.\"\r\n\r\nIt was hard to see how one man could go in two boats, but what he meant\r\nwas, a boat twice as large as my own.\r\n\r\nOne day I said to my slave, \"Do you know who made you?\"\r\n\r\nBut he could not tell at all what these words meant. So I said, \"Do you\r\nknow who made the sea, the ground we tread on, the hills, and woods?\" He\r\nsaid it was Beek, whose home was a great way off, and that he was so old\r\nthat the sea and the land were not so old as he.\r\n\r\n\"If this old man has made all things, why do not all things bow down to\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\nMy slave gave a grave look, and said, \"All things say 'O' to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do the men in your land go when they die?\"\r\n\r\n\"All go to Beek.\"\r\n\r\nI then held my hand up to the sky to point to it, and said, \"God dwells\r\nthere. He made the world, and all things in it. The moon and the stars\r\nare the work of his hand. God sends the wind and the rain on the earth,\r\nand the streams that flow: He hides the face of the sky with clouds,\r\nmakes the grass to grow for the beasts of the field, and herbs for the\r\nuse of man. God's love knows no end. When we pray, He draws near to us\r\nand hears us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a real joy to my poor slave to hear me talk of these things. He\r\nsat still for a long time, then gave a sigh, and told me that he would\r\nsay \"O\" to Beek no more, for he was but a short way off, and yet could\r\nnot hear, till men went up the hill to speak to him.\r\n\r\n\"Did you go up the hill to speak to him?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No, Okes go up to Beek, not young mans.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do Okes say to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"They say 'O.'\"\r\n\r\nNow that I brought my man Friday to know that Beek was not the true God,\r\nsuch was the sense he had of my worth, that I had fears lest I should\r\nstand in the place of Beek. I did my best to call forth his faith in\r\nChrist, and make it strong and clear, till at last--thanks be to the\r\nLord--I brought him to the love of Him, with the whole grasp of his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nTo please my poor slave, I gave him a sketch of my whole life; I told\r\nhim where I was born, and where I spent my days when a child. He was\r\nglad to hear tales of the land of my birth, and of the trade which we\r\nkeep up, in ships, with all parts of the known world. I gave him a knife\r\nand a belt, which made him dance with joy.\r\n\r\nOne day as we stood on the top of the hill at the east side of the isle,\r\nI saw him fix his eyes on the main land, and stand for a long time to,\r\ngaze at it; then jump and sing, and call out to me.\r\n\r\n\"What do you see?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Oh joy!\" said he, with a fierce glee in his eyes, \"Oh glad! There see\r\nmy land!\"\r\n\r\nWhy did he strain his eyes to stare at this land, as if he had a wish\r\nto be there? It put fears in my mind which made me feel far, less at\r\nmy ease with him. Thought I, if he should go back to his home, he will\r\nthink no more of what I have taught him, and done for him. He will be\r\nsure to tell the rest of his tribe all my ways, and come back with, it\r\nmay be, scores of them, and kill me, and then dance round me, as they\r\ndid round the men, the last time they came on my isle.\r\n\r\nBut these were all false fears, though they found a place in my mind a\r\nlong while; and I was not so kind to him now as I had been. From this\r\ntime I made it a rule, day by day, to find out if there were grounds for\r\nmy fears or not. I said, \"Do you not wish to be once more in your own\r\nland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I be much O glad to be at my own land.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do there? Would you turn wild, and be as you were?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I would tell them to be good, tell them eat bread, corn, milk,\r\nno eat man more!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they would kill you!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, they no kill; they love learn.\"\r\n\r\nHe then told me that some white men, who had come on their shores in a\r\nboat, had taught them a great deal.\r\n\r\n\"Then will you go back to your land with me?\"\r\n\r\nHe said he could not swim so far, so I told him he should help me to\r\nbuild a boat to go in. Then he said, \"If you go, I go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I go? why they would eat me!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, me make them much love you.\"\r\n\r\nThen he told me as well as he could, how kind they had been to some\r\nwhite men. I brought out the large boat to hear what he thought of it,\r\nbut he said it was too small. We then went to look at the old ship's\r\nboat, which, as it had been in the sun for years, was not at all in a\r\nsound state. The poor man made sure that it would do. But how were we to\r\nknow this? I told him we should build a boat as large as that, and that\r\nhe should go home in it. He spoke not a word, but was grave and sad.\r\n\r\n\"What ails you?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you grieve mad with your man?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? I am not cross with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No cross? no cross with me? Why send your man home to his own land,\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not tell me you would like to go back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, we both there; no wish self there, if you not there!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what should I do there?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do great deal much good! you teach wild men be good men; you tell\r\nthem know God, pray God, and lead new life.\"\r\n\r\nWe soon set to work to make a boat that would take us both. The first\r\nthing was to look out for some large trees that grew near the shore, so\r\nthat we could launch our boat when it was made. My slave's plan was to\r\nburn the wood to make it the right shape; but as mine was to hew it,\r\nI set him to work with my tools; and in two months' time we had made a\r\ngood strong boat; but it took a long while to get her down to the shore.\r\n\r\nFriday had the whole charge of her; and, large as she was, he made her\r\nmove with ease, and said, \"he thought she go there well, though great\r\nblow wind!\" He did not know that I meant to make a mast and sail. I cut\r\ndown a young fir tree for the mast, and then I set to work at the sail.\r\nIt made me laugh to see my man stand and stare, when he came to watch me\r\nsail the boat. But he soon gave a jump, a laugh, and a clap of the hands\r\nwhen he saw the sail jibe and fall, first on this side, then on that.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to do was to stow our boat up in the creek, where we dug\r\na small dock; and when the tide was low, we made a dam, to keep out the\r\nsea. The time of year had now come for us to set sail, so we got out all\r\nour stores, to put them in the boat.\r\n\r\nOne day I sent Friday to the shore, to get a sort of herb that grew\r\nthere. I soon heard him cry out to me, \"O grief! O bad! O bad! O out\r\nthere boats, one, two, three!\" \"Keep a stout heart,\" said I, to cheer\r\nhim. The poor man shook with fear; for he thought that the men who\r\nbrought him here, had now come back to kill him.\r\n\r\n\"Can you fight?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Me shoot; but me saw three boats; one, two, three!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have no fear; those that we do not kill, will be sure to take fright at\r\nthe sound of our guns. Now will you stand by me, and do just as you are\r\nbid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me die when you bid die.\"\r\n\r\nI gave him a good draught of rum; and when he had drunk this, he took up\r\nan axe and two guns, each of which had a charge of swan shot. I took two\r\nguns as well, and put large shot in them, and then hung my great sword\r\nby my side. From the top of the bill, I saw with the help of my glass,\r\nthat the boats had each brought eight men, and one slave. They had come\r\non shore near the creek, where a grove of young trees grew close down to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThey had with them three slaves, bound hand and foot, and you who read\r\nthis, may guess what they were brought here for. I felt that I must try\r\nand save them from so hard a fate, and that to do this, I should have\r\nto put some of their foes to death. So we set forth on our way. I gave\r\nFriday strict charge to keep close to me, and not to fire till I told\r\nhim to do so.\r\n\r\nWe went full a mile out of our way, that we might get round to the wood\r\nto bide there. But we had not gone far, when my old qualms came back\r\nto me, and I thought, \"Is it for me to dip my hands in man's blood? Why\r\nshould I kill those who have done me no harm, and mean not to hurt me?\r\nNay, who do not so much as know that they are in the wrong, when they\r\nhold these feasts. Are not their ways a sign that God has left them\r\n(with the rest of their tribe) to their own dull hearts? God did not\r\ncall me to be a judge for Him. He who said, 'Thou shalt not kill,' said\r\nit for me, as well as the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\nA throng of thoughts like these would rush on my mind, as if to warn me\r\nto pause, till I felt sure that there was more to call me to the work\r\nthan I then knew of. I took my stand in the wood, to watch the men at\r\ntheir feast, and then crept on, with Friday close at my heels. Thus we\r\nwent till we came to the skirts of the wood. Then I said to. Friday, \"Go\r\nup to the top of that tree, and bring me word if you can see the men.\"\r\n\r\nHe went, and quick as thought, came back to say that they were all round\r\nthe fire, and that the man who was bound on the sand would be the next\r\nthey would kill. But when he told me that it was a white man, one of my\r\nown race, I felt the blood boil in my veins. Two of the gang had gone to\r\nloose the white man from his bonds; so now was the time to fire.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of our guns, we saw all the men jump up from the ground\r\nwhere they sat. It must have been the first gun the I had heard in their\r\nlives. They knew not which way to look. I now threw down my piece, and\r\ntook up a small gun; Friday did the same; and I gave him the word to\r\nfire! The men ran right and left, with yells and screams.\r\n\r\nI now made a rush out of the wood, that they might see me, with my man\r\nFriday at my heels, of course. We gave a loud shout, and ran up to the\r\nwhite man as fast as we could. There he lay on the hot sand. I cut the\r\nflag, or rush, by which he was bound, but he was too weak to stand or\r\nspeak, so I gave him some rum. He let me know by all the signs that he\r\ncould think of, how much he stood in my debt for all that I had done for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI said, \"We will talk of that bye and bye; but now we must do what we\r\ncan to save our lives.\" Friday, who was free to go where he chose, flew\r\nhere and there, and put all the men to the rout. They fled in full haste\r\nto their boats, and were soon out at sea; and so we got rid of our foes\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nThe man whom we had found on the sand told us that his name was Carl,\r\nand that he came from Spain. But there was one more man to claim our\r\ncare; for the black men had left a small boat on the sands, and in this\r\nI saw a poor wretch who lay half dead. He could not so much as look up,\r\nso tight was he bound, neck and heels. When I cut the bonds from him he\r\ngave a deep groan, for he thought that all this was but to lead him out\r\nto die.\r\n\r\nFriday then came up, and I bade him speak to the old man in his own\r\ntongue, and tell him that he was free. This good news gave him strength,\r\nand he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him talk, and\r\nto look him in the face, it brought the tears to my eyes to see him kiss\r\nand hug the poor old man, and dance round him with joy, then weep, wring\r\nhis hands, and beat his own face and head, and then laugh once more,\r\nsing, and leap. For a long time he could not speak to me, so as to, let\r\nme know what all this meant. But at length he told me that he was the\r\nson of this poor old man, and that his name was Jaf.\r\n\r\nIt would be a hard task for me to tell of all the quaint, signs Friday\r\nmade to show his joy. He went in and out of the boat five or six times,\r\nsat down by old Jaf, and held the poor old man's head close to his\r\nbreast to warm it; then he set to work to rub his arms and feet, which\r\nwere cold and stiff from the bonds. I told Friday to give him some rum\r\nand bread; but he said, \"None! Bad dog eat all up self.\" He then ran off\r\nstraight to the house, and took no heed of my calls, but went as swift\r\nas a deer.\r\n\r\nIn an hour's time, he came back with a jug in his hand. The good soul\r\nhad gone all the way to the house, that Jaf might have a fresh draught\r\nfrom my well; and with it he brought two cakes, one of which I bade him\r\ntake to Carl, who lay in the shade of a tree. His limbs were stiff and\r\ncold, and he was too weak to say a word.\r\n\r\nI set my man to rub his feet with rum, and while he did so, I saw Friday\r\nturn his head round from time to time, to steal a look at the old man.\r\nThen we brought Carl and Jaf home from the boat on our backs, as they\r\ncould not walk. The door of my house was at the top, and the poor sick\r\nmen could not climb the steps by which I got in, so we made for them a\r\ntent of old sails.\r\n\r\nI was now a king of these three men, as well as Lord of the isle; and\r\nI felt proud to say, \"They all owe their lives to their king, and would\r\nlay them down for him if he bade them do so.\" But I did not think that\r\nmy reign was so soon to come to an end. The next thing for us to do was\r\nto give Carl and Jaf some food, and to kill and roast a kid, to which we\r\nall four sat down, and I did my best to cheer them.\r\n\r\nCarl in a few days grew quite strong, and I set him to work to dig some\r\nland for seed; for it was clear we should want more corn now that we had\r\ntwo more mouths to fill. So we put in the ground all the stock of grain\r\nI had, and thus we all four had as much work as we could do for some\r\ntime. When the crop grew, and was ripe, we found we had a good store of\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nWe made a plan that Carl and Jaf should go back to the main land, to\r\ntry if they could get some of the white men who had been cast on shore\r\nthere, to come and live with us; so they got out the boat, and took\r\nwith them two guns and food for eight days. They were to come back in a\r\nweek's time, and I bade them hang out a sign when they came in sight, so\r\nthat we might know who they were.\r\n\r\nOne day, Friday ran up to me in great glee, and said, \"They are back!\r\nThey are back!\" A mile from shore, there was a boat with a sail, which\r\nstood in for the land; but I knew it could not be the one which our two\r\nfriends had gone out in, for it was on the wrong side of the isle for\r\nthat. I saw too, through my glass, a ship out at sea. There were twelve\r\nmen in the boat, three of whom were bound in chains, and four had fire\r\narms.\r\n\r\nBye and bye, I saw one of the men raise his sword to those who were\r\nin chains, and I felt sure that all was not right. Then I saw that the\r\nthree men who had been bound were set free; and when they had come on\r\nshore they lay on the ground, in the shade of a tree. I was soon at\r\ntheir side, for their looks, so sad and worn, brought to my mind the\r\nfirst few hours I had spent in this wild spot, where all to me was wrapt\r\nin gloom.\r\n\r\nI went up to these men, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, Sirs?\"\r\n\r\nThey gave a start at my voice and at my strange dress, and made a move\r\nas if they would fly from me. I said, \"Do not fear me, for it may be\r\nthat you have a friend at hand, though you do not think it.\" \"He must be\r\nsent from the sky then,\" said one of them with a grave look; and he took\r\noff his hat to me at the same time. \"All help is from thence, Sir,\" I\r\nsaid; \"but what can I do to aid you? You look as if you had some load of\r\ngrief on your breast. I saw one of the men lift his sword as if to kill\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe tears ran down the poor man's face, as he said,\r\n\r\n\"Is this a god, or is it but a man?\" \"Have no doubt on that score, Sir,\"\r\nsaid I, \"for a god would not have come with a dress like this. No, do\r\nnot fear--nor raise your hopes too high; for you see but a man, yet one\r\nwho will do all he can to help you. Your speech shows me that you come\r\nfrom the same land as I do. I will do all I can to serve you. Tell me\r\nyour case.\" \"Our case, Sir, is too long to you while they who would kill\r\nus are so near. My name is Paul. To be short, Sir, my crew have thrust\r\nme out of my ship, which you see out there, and have left me here to\r\ndie. It was as much as I could do to make them sheath their swords,\r\nwhich you saw were drawn to slay me. They have set me down in this isle\r\nwith these two men, my friend here, and the ship's mate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where have they gone?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"There, in the wood, close by. I fear they may have seen and heard us.\r\nIf they have, they will be sure to kill us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they fire-arms?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have four guns, one of which is in the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, leave all to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two of the men,\" said he, \"who are worse than the rest. All\r\nbut these I feel sure would go back to work the ship.\"\r\n\r\nI thought it was best to speak out to Paul at once, and I said, \"Now if\r\nI save your life, there are two things which you must do.\" But he read\r\nmy thoughts, and said, \"If you save my life, you shall do as you like\r\nwith me and my ship, and take her where you please.\"\r\n\r\nI saw that the two men, in whose charge the boat had been left, had come\r\non shore; so the first thing I did was to send Friday to fetch from it\r\nthe oars, the sail, and the gun. And now the ship might be said to be in\r\nour hands. When the time came for the men to go back to the ship, they\r\nwere in a great rage; for, as the boat had now no sail nor oars, they\r\nknew not how to get out to their ship.\r\n\r\nWe heard them say that it was a strange sort of isle, for that sprites\r\nhad come to the boat, to take off the sails and oars. We could see them\r\nrun to and fro, with great rage; then go and sit in the boat to rest,\r\nand then come on shore once more. When they drew near to us, Paul and\r\nFriday would fain have had me fall on them at once. But my wish was to\r\nspare them, and kill as few as I could. I told two of my men to creep\r\non their hands and feet close to the ground, so that they might not be\r\nseen, and when they got up to the men, not to fire till I gave the word.\r\n\r\nThey had not stood thus long, when three of the crew came up to us. Till\r\nnow, we had but heard their voice, but when they came so near as to be\r\nseen, Paul and Friday stood up and shot at them. Two of the men fell\r\ndead, and they were the worst of the crew, and the third ran off. At the\r\nsound of the guns I came up, but it was so dark that the men could not\r\ntell if there were three of us or three score.\r\n\r\nIt fell out just as I could wish, for I heard the men ask, \"To whom must\r\nwe yield, and where are they?\" Friday told them that Paul was there with\r\nthe king of the isle, who had brought with him a crowd of men! At this\r\none of the crew said, \"If Paul will spare our lives, we will yield.\"\r\n\"Then,\" said Friday, \"you shall know the king's will.\" Then Paul said to\r\nthem, \"You know my voice; if you lay down your arms the king will spare\r\nyour lives!\"\r\n\r\nThey fell on their knees to beg the same of me. I took good care that\r\nthey did not see me, but I gave them my word that they should all live,\r\nthat I should take four of them to work the ship, and that the rest\r\nwould be bound hand and foot, for the good faith of the four. This was\r\nto show them what a stern king I was.\r\n\r\nOf course I soon set them free, and I put them in a way to take my place\r\non the isle. I told them of all my ways, taught them how to mind the\r\ngoats, how to work the farm, and make the bread. I gave them a house to\r\nlive in, fire arms, tools, and my two tame cats, in fact, all but Poll\r\nand my gold.\r\n\r\nAs I sat on the top of the hill, Paul came up to me. He held out his\r\nhand to point to the ship, and with much warmth took me to his arms, and\r\nsaid, \"My dear friend, there is your ship! For she is all yours, and so\r\nare we, and all that is in her.\"\r\n\r\nI cast my eyes to the ship, which rode half a mile off the shore, at the\r\nmouth of the creek, and near the place where I had brought my rafts to\r\nthe land. Yes, there she stood, the ship that was to set me free, and to\r\ntake me where I might choose to go. She set her sails to the wind, and\r\nher flags threw out their gay stripes in the breeze. Such a sight was\r\ntoo much for me, and I fell down faint with joy. Paul then took out a\r\nflask which he had brought for me, and gave me a dram, which I drank,\r\nbut for a good while I could not speak to him.\r\n\r\nFriday and Paul then went on board the ship, and Paul took charge of her\r\nonce more. We did not start that night, but at noon the next day I left\r\nthe isle!\r\n\r\nThat lone isle, where I had spent so great a part of my life--not much\r\nless than thrice ten long years.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back to the dear land of my birth, all was strange and new\r\nto me. I went to my old home at York, but none of my friends were there,\r\nand to my great grief I saw, on the stone at their grave, the sad tale\r\nof their death.\r\n\r\nAs they had thought, of course, that I was dead, they had not left me\r\ntheir wealth and lands, so that I stood much in want of means, for it\r\nwas but a small sum that I had brought with me from the isle. But in\r\nthis time of need, I had the luck to find my good friend who once took\r\nme up at sea. He was now grown too old for work, and had put his son\r\nin the ship in his place. He did not know me at first, but I was soon\r\nbrought to his mind when I told him who I was. I found from him that the\r\nland which I had bought on my way to the isle was now worth much.\r\n\r\nAs it was a long way off, I felt no wish to go and live there so I made\r\nup my mind to sell it, and in the course of a few months, I got for it a\r\nsum so large as to make me a rich man all at once.\r\n\r\nWeeks, months, and years went by; I had a farm, a wife, and two sons,\r\nand was by no means young; but still I could not get rid of a strong\r\nwish which dwelt in my thoughts by day and my dreams by night, and that\r\nwas to set foot once more in my old isle.\r\n\r\nI had now no need to work for food, or for means of life; all I had to\r\ndo was to teach my boys to be wise and good, to live at my ease, and\r\nsee my wealth grow day by day. Yet the wish to go back to my wild haunts\r\nclung round me like a cloud, and I could in no way drive it from me,\r\nso true is it that \"what is bred in the bone will not come out of the\r\nflesh.\"\r\n\r\nAt length I lost my wife, which was a great blow to me, and my home was\r\nnow so sad, that I made up my mind to launch out once more on the broad\r\nsea, and go with my man Friday to that lone isle where dwelt all my\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\nI took with me as large a store of tools, clothes, and such like goods\r\nas I had room for, and men of skill in all kinds of trades, to live in\r\nthe isle. When we set sail, we had a fair wind for some time, but one\r\nnight the mate, who was at the watch, told me he saw a flash of fire,\r\nand heard a gun go off. At this we all ran on deck, from whence we saw a\r\ngreat light, and as there was no land that way, we knew that it must be\r\nsome ship on fire at sea, which could not be far off, for we heard the\r\nsound of the gun.\r\n\r\nThe wind was still fair, so we made our way for the point where we saw\r\nthe light, and in half an hour, it was but too plain that a large ship\r\nwas on fire in the midst of the broad sea. I gave the word to fire off\r\nfive guns, and we then lay by, to wait till break of day. But in the\r\ndead of the night, the ship blew up in the air, the flames shot forth,\r\nand what there was left of the ship sank. We hung out lights, and our\r\nguns kept up a fire all night long, to let the crew know that there was\r\nhelp at hand.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock the next day we found, by the aid of the glass, that\r\ntwo of the ship's boats were out at sea, quite full of men. They had\r\nseen us, and had done their best to make us see them, and in half an\r\nhour we came up with them.\r\n\r\nIt would be a hard task for me to set forth in words the scene which\r\ntook place in my ship, when the poor French folk (for such they were)\r\ncame on board. As to grief and fear, these are soon told--sighs, tears,\r\nand groans make up the sum of them--but such a cause of joy as this was,\r\nin sooth, too much for them to bear, weak and all but dead as they were.\r\n\r\nSome would send up shouts of joy that rent the sky; some would cry and\r\nwring their hands as if in the depths of grief; some would dance, laugh,\r\nand sing; not a few were dumb, sick, faint, in a swoon, or half mad; and\r\ntwo or three were seen to give thanks to God.\r\n\r\nIn this strange group, there was a young French priest who did his best\r\nto soothe those round him, and I saw him go up to some of the crew,\r\nand say to them, \"Why do you scream, and tear your hair, and wring your\r\nhands, my men? Let your joy be free and full, give it full range and\r\nscope, but leave off this trick of the hands, and lift them up in\r\npraise; let your voice swell out, not in screams, but in hymns of thanks\r\nto God, who has brought you out of so great a strait, for this will add\r\npeace to your joy.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, they were all in a right frame of mind, so I gave them\r\nwhat stores I could spare, and put them on board a ship that we met with\r\non her way to France, all save five who, with the priest, had a wish to\r\njoin me.\r\n\r\nBut we had not set sail long, when we fell in with a ship that had been\r\nblown out to sea by a storm, and had lost her masts; and, worse than\r\nall, her crew had not had an ounce of meat or bread for ten days. I\r\ngave them all some food, which they ate like wolves in the snow, but I\r\nthought it best to check them, as I had fears that so much all at once\r\nwould cause the death of some of them.\r\n\r\nThere were a youth and a young girl in the ship who the mate said he\r\nthought must be dead, but he had not had the heart to go near them, for\r\nthe food was all gone. I found that they were faint for the want of it,\r\nand as it were in the jaws of death; but in a short time they both got\r\nwell, and as they had no wish to go back to their ship, I took them with\r\nme. So now I had eight more on board my ship, than I had when I first\r\nset out.\r\n\r\nIn three months from the time when I left home, I came in sight of my\r\nisle, and I brought the ship safe up, by the side of the creek, which\r\nwas near my old house.\r\n\r\nI went up to Friday, to ask if he knew where he was. He took a look\r\nround him, and soon, with a clap of the hands, said \"O yes! O there! O\r\nyes! O there!\" Bye and bye, he set up a dance with such wild glee, that\r\nit was as much as I could do to keep him on deck. \"Well, what think you,\r\nFriday?\" said I; \"shall we find those whom we left still here?--Shall we\r\nsee poor old Jaf?\" He stood quite mute for a while, but when I spoke\r\nof old Jaf (whose son Friday was), the tears ran down his face, and the\r\npoor soul was as sad as could be. \"No, no,\" said he, \"no more, no, no\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nAs we caught sight of some men at the top of the hill, I gave word to\r\nfire three guns, to show that we were friends, and soon we saw smoke\r\nrise from the side of the creek. I then went on shore in a boat, with\r\nthe priest and Friday, and hung out a white flag of peace. The first man\r\nI cast my eyes on at the creek, was my old friend Carl, who, when I was\r\nlast on the isle, had been brought here in bonds.\r\n\r\nI gave strict charge to the men in the boat not to go on shore, but\r\nFriday could not be kept back, for with his quick eye he had caught\r\nsight of old Jaf. It brought the tears to our eyes to see his joy when\r\nhe met the old man. He gave him a kiss, took him up in his arms, set\r\nhim down in the shade, then stood a short way off to look at him, as one\r\nwould look at a work of art, then felt him with his hand, and all this\r\ntime he was in full talk, and told him, one by one, all the strange\r\ntales of what he had seen since they had last met.\r\n\r\nAs to my friend Carl, he came up to me, and with much warmth shook my\r\nhands, and then took me to my old house, which he now gave up to me. I\r\ncould no more have found the place, than if I had not been there at all.\r\nThe rows of trees stood so thick and close, that the house could not be\r\ngot at, save by such blind ways as none but those who made them could\r\nfind out. \"Why have you built all these forts?\" said I. Carl told me\r\nthat he felt sure I should say there was much need of them, when I heard\r\nhow they had spent their time since they had come to the isle.\r\n\r\nHe brought twelve men to the spot where I stood, and said, \"Sir, all\r\nthese men owe their lives to you.\" Then, one by one, they came up to me,\r\nnot as if they had been the mere crew of a ship, but like men of rank\r\nwho had come to kiss the hand of their king.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to bear all that had been done in the isle since I\r\nhad left it. But I must first state that, when we were on the point to\r\nset sail from the isle, a feud sprang up on board our ship, which we\r\ncould not put down, till we had laid two of the men in chains. The next\r\nday, these two men stole each of them a gun and some small arms, and\r\ntook the ship's boat, and ran off with it to join the three bad men on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I found this out, I sent the long-boat on shore, with twelve\r\nmen and the mate, and off they went to seek the two who had left the\r\nship. But their search was in vain, nor could they find one of the rest,\r\nfor they had all fled to the woods when they saw the boat. We had now\r\nlost five of the crew, but the three first were so much worse than the\r\nlast two, that in a few days they sent them out of doors, and would have\r\nno more to do with them, nor would they for a long while give them food\r\nto eat.\r\n\r\nSo the two poor men had to live as well as they could by hard work, and\r\nthey set up their tents on the north shore of the isle, to be out of the\r\nway of the wild men, who were wont to land on the east side. Here they\r\nbuilt them two huts, one to lodge in, and one to lay up their stores\r\nin; and the men from Spain gave them some corn for seed, as well as some\r\npeas which I had left them. They soon learned to dig, and plant, and\r\nhedge in their land, in the mode which I had set for them, and in short,\r\nto lead good lives, so that I shall now call them the \"two good men.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the three bad men saw, this, they were full of spite, and came\r\none day to tease and vex them. They told them that the isle was their\r\nown, and that no one else had a right to build on it, if they did not\r\npay rent. The two good men thought at first that they were in jest, and\r\ntold them to come and sit down, and see what fine homes they had built,\r\nand say what rent they would ask.\r\n\r\nBut one of the three said they should soon see that they were not in\r\njest, and took a torch in his hand, and put it to the roof of the but,\r\nand would have set it on fire, had not one of the two good men trod the\r\nfire out with his feet. The bad man was in such a rage at this, that he\r\nran at him with a pole he had in his hand, and this brought on a fight,\r\nthe end of which was that the three men had to stand off. But in a short\r\ntime they came back, and trod down the corn, and shot the goats and\r\nyoung kids, which the poor men had got to bring up tame for their store.\r\n\r\nOne day when the two men were out, they came to their home, and said,\r\n\"Ha! there's the nest, but the birds are flown.\" They then set to work\r\nto pull down both the huts, and left not a stick, nor scarce a sign on\r\nthe ground to show where the tents had stood. They tore up, too, all the\r\ngoods and stock that they could find, and when they had done this, they\r\ntold it all to the men of Spain, and said, \"You, sirs, shall have the\r\nsame sauce, if you do not mend your ways.\"\r\n\r\nThey then fell to blows and hard words, but Carl had them bound in\r\ncords, and took their arms from them. The men of Spain then said they\r\nwould do them no harm, and if they would live at peace they would help\r\nthem, and that they should live with them as they had done till that\r\ntime, but they could not give them back their arms for three or four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nOne night Carl--whom I shall call \"the chief,\" as he took the lead of\r\nall the rest--felt a great weight on his mind, and could get no sleep,\r\nthough he was quite well in health. He lay still for some time, but as\r\nhe, did not feel at case, he got up, and took a look out. But as it was\r\ntoo dark to see far, and he heard no noise, he went back to his bed.\r\nStill it was all one, he could not sleep; and though he knew not why,\r\nhis thoughts would give him no rest.\r\n\r\nHe then woke up one of his friends, and told him how it had been with\r\nhim. \"Say you so?\" said he \"What if there should be some bad plot at\r\nwork near us!\" They then set off to the top of the hill, where I was\r\nwont to go, and from thence they saw the light of a fire, quite a short\r\nway from them, and heard the sounds of men, not of one or two, but of a\r\ngreat crowd. We need not doubt that the chief and the man with him now\r\nran back at once, to tell all the rest what they had seen; and when they\r\nheard the news, they could not be kept close where they were, but must\r\nall run out to see how things stood.\r\n\r\nAt last they thought that the best thing to do would be, while it was\r\ndark, to send old Jaf out as a spy, to learn who they were, and what\r\nthey meant to do. When the old man had been gone an hour or two, he\r\nbrought word back that he had been in the midst of the foes, though they\r\nhad not seen him, and that they were in two sets or tribes who were at\r\nwar, and had come there to fight. And so it was, for in a short time\r\nthey heard the noise of the fight, which went on for two hours, and at\r\nthe end, with three loud shouts or screams, they left the isle in their\r\nboats. Thus my friends were set free from all their fears, and saw no\r\nmore of their wild foes for some time.\r\n\r\nOne day a whim took the three bad men that they would go to the main\r\nland, from whence the wild men came, and try if they could not seize\r\nsome of them, and bring them home as slaves, so as to make them do the\r\nhard part of their work for them. The chief gave them all the arms and\r\nstores that they could want, and a large boat to go in, but when they\r\nbade them \"God speed,\" no one thought that they would find their way\r\nback to the isle. But lo! in three weeks and a day, they did in truth\r\ncome back. One of the two good men was the first to catch sight of them,\r\nand tell the news to his friends.\r\n\r\nThe men said that they had found the land in two days, and that the wild\r\nmen gave them roots and fish to eat, and were so kind as to bring down\r\neight slaves to take back with them, three of whom were men and five\r\nwere girls. So they gave their good hosts an axe, an old key, and a\r\nknife, and brought off the slaves in their boat to the isle. As the\r\nchief and his friends did not care to wed the young girls, the five men\r\nwho had been the crew of Paul's ship drew lots for choice, so that each\r\nhad a wife, and the three men slaves were set to work for the two good\r\nmen, though there was not much for them to do.\r\n\r\nBut one of them ran off to the woods, and they could not hear of him\r\nmore. They had good cause to think that he found his way home, as in\r\nthree or four weeks some wild men came to the isle, and when they\r\nhad had their feast and dance, they went off in two days' time. So my\r\nfriends might well fear that if this slave got safe home, he would be\r\nsure to tell the wild men that they were in the isle, and in what part\r\nof it they might be found. And so it came to pass, for in less than two\r\nmonths, six boats of wild men, with eight or ten men in each boat, came\r\nto the north side of the isle, where they had not been known to come up\r\nto that time.\r\n\r\nThe foe had brought their boats to land, not more than a mile from the\r\ntent of the two good men, and it was there that the slave who had run\r\noff had been kept. These men had the good luck to see the boats when\r\nthey were a long way off, so that it took them quite an hour from that\r\ntime to reach the shore.\r\n\r\nMy friends now had to think how that hour was to be spent. The first\r\nthing they did was to bind the two slaves that were left, and to take\r\ntheir wives, and as much of their stores as they could, to some dark\r\nplace in the woods. They then sent a third slave to the chief and his\r\nmen, to tell them the news, and to ask for help.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far in the woods, when they saw, to their great grief\r\nand rage, that their huts were in flames, and that the wild men ran to\r\nand fro, like beasts in search of prey. But still our men went on, and\r\ndid not halt, till they came to a thick part of the wood, where the\r\nlarge trunk of an old tree stood, and in this tree they both took their\r\npost. But they had not been there long, when two of the wild men ran\r\nthat way, and they saw three more, and then five more, who all ran the\r\nsame way, as if they knew where they were.\r\n\r\nOur two poor men made up their minds to let the first two pass, and then\r\ntake the three and the five in line, as they came up, but to fire at one\r\nat a time, as the first shot might chance to hit all three.\r\n\r\nSo the man who was to fire put three or four balls in his gun, and from\r\na hole in the tree, took a sure aim, and stood still till the three wild\r\nmen came so near that he could not miss them. They soon saw that one of\r\nthese three was the slave that had fled from them, as they both knew him\r\nwell, and they made up their minds that they would kill him, though they\r\nshould both fire.\r\n\r\nAt the first shot two of the wild men fell dead, and the third had a\r\ngraze on his arm, and though not much hurt, sat down on the ground with\r\nloud screams and yells. When the five men who came next, heard the sound\r\nof the gun and the slave's cries, they stood still at first, as if they\r\nwere struck dumb with fright. So our two men both shot off their guns in\r\nthe midst of them, and then ran up and bound them safe with cords.\r\n\r\nThey then went to the thick part of the wood, where they had put their\r\nwives and slaves, to see if all were safe there, and to their joy they\r\nfound that though the wild men had been quite near them, they had not\r\nfound them out. While they were here, the chief and his men came up, and\r\ntold them that the rest had gone to take care of my old house and grove,\r\nin case the troop of wild men should spread so far that way.\r\n\r\nThey then went back to the burnt huts, and when they came in sight of\r\nthe shore, they found that their foes had all gone out to sea. So they\r\nset to work to build up their huts, and as all the men in the isle lent\r\nthem their aid, they were soon in a way to thrive once more. For five or\r\nsix months they saw no more of the wild men. But one day a large fleet\r\nof more than a score of boats came in sight, full of men who had bows,\r\ndarts, clubs, swords, and such like arms of war, and our friends were\r\nall in great fear.\r\n\r\nAs they came at dusk, and at the East side of the isle, our men had the\r\nwhole night to think of what they should do. And as they knew that the\r\nmost safe way was to hide and lie in wait, they first of all took down\r\nthe huts which were built for the two good men, and drove their goats to\r\nthe cave, for they thought the wild men would go straight there as soon\r\nas it was day, and play the old game.\r\n\r\nThe next day they took up their post with all their force at the wood,\r\nnear the home of the two men, to wait for the foe. They gave no guns to\r\nthe slaves, but each of them had a long staff with a spike at the end of\r\nit, and by his side an axe. There were two of the wives who could not be\r\nkept back, but would go out and fight with bows and darts.\r\n\r\nThe wild men came on with a bold and fierce mien, not in a line, but\r\nall in crowds here and there, to the point were our men lay in wait for\r\nthem. When they were so near as to be in range of the guns, our men shot\r\nat them right and left with five or six balls in each charge. As the foe\r\ncame up in close crowds, they fell dead on all sides, and most of those\r\nthat they did not kill were much hurt, so that great fear and dread came\r\non them all.\r\n\r\nOur men then fell on them from three points with the butt end of their\r\nguns, swords, and staves, and did their work so well that the wild men\r\nset up a loud shriek, and flew for their lives to the woods and hills,\r\nwith all the speed that fear and swift feet could help them to do. As\r\nour men did not care to chase them, they got to the shore where they had\r\ncome to land and where the boats lay.\r\n\r\nBut their rout was not yet at an end, for it blew a great storm that day\r\nfrom the sea, so that they could not put off. And as the storm went on\r\nall that night, when the tide came up, the surge of the sea drove most\r\nof their boats so high on the shore, that they could not be got off save\r\nwith great toil, and the force of the waves on the beach broke some of\r\nthem to bits.\r\n\r\nAt break of day, our men went forth to find them, and when they saw the\r\nstate of things, they got some dry wood from a dead tree, and set their\r\nboats on fire. When the foe saw this, they ran all through the isle with\r\nloud cries, as if they were mad, so that our men did not know at first\r\nwhat to do with them, for they trod all the corn down with their feet,\r\nand tore up the vines just as the grapes were ripe, and did a great deal\r\nof harm.\r\n\r\nAt last they brought old Jaf to them, to tell them how kind they would\r\nbe to them, that they would save their lives, and give them part of the\r\nisle to live in, if they would keep in their own bounds, and that they\r\nshould have corn to plant, and should make it grow for their bread. They\r\nwere but too glad to have such good terms of peace, and they soon learnt\r\nto make all kinds of work with canes, wood, and sticks, such as chairs,\r\nstools, and beds, and this they did with great skill when they were once\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\nFrom this time till I came back to the isle my friends saw no more wild\r\nmen. I now told the chief that I had not come to take off his men, but\r\nto bring more, and to give them all such things as they would want to\r\nguard their homes from foes, and cheer up their hearts.\r\n\r\nThe next day I made a grand feast for them all, and the ship's cook and\r\nmate came on shore to dress it. We brought out our rounds of salt beef\r\nand pork, a bowl of punch, some beer, and French wines; and Carl gave\r\nthe cooks five whole kids to roast, three of which were sent to the crew\r\non board ship, that they, on their part, might feast on fresh meat from\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nI gave each of the men a shirt, a coat, a hat, and a pair of shoes, and\r\nI need not say how glad they were to meet with gifts so new to them.\r\nThen I brought out the tools, of which each man had a spade, a rake, an\r\naxe, a crow, a saw, a knife and such like things as well as arms, and\r\nall that they could want for the use of them.\r\n\r\nAs I saw there was a kind will on all sides, I now took on shore the\r\nyouth and the maid whom we had brought from the ship that we met on her\r\nway to France. The girl had been well brought up, and all the crew had\r\na good word for her. As they both had a wish to be left on the isle,\r\nI gave them each a plot of ground, on which they had tents and barns\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nI had brought out with me five men to live here, one of whom could turn\r\nhis hand to all sorts of things, so I gave him the name of \"Jack of all\r\nTrades.\"\r\n\r\nOne day the French priest came to ask if I would leave my man Friday\r\nhere, for through him, he said, he could talk to the black men in their\r\nown tongue, and teach them the things of God. \"Need I add,\" said he,\r\n\"that it was for this cause that I came here?\" I felt that I could not\r\npart with my man Friday for the whole world, so I told the priest that\r\nif I could have made up my mind to leave him here, I was quite sure that\r\nFriday would not part from me.\r\n\r\nWhen I had seen that all things were in a good state on the isle, I set\r\nto work to put my ship to rights, to go home once more. One day, as I\r\nwas on my way to it, the youth whom I had brought from the ship that\r\nwas burnt, came up to me, and said, \"Sir, you have brought a priest with\r\nyou, and while you are here, we want him to wed two of us.\"\r\n\r\nI made a guess that one of these must be the maid that I had brought\r\nto the isle, and that it was the wish of the young man to make her his\r\nwife. I spoke to him with some warmth in my tone, and bade him turn it\r\nwell in his mind first, as the girl was not in the same rank of life as\r\nhe had been brought up in. But he said, with a smile, that I had made a\r\nwrong guess, for it was \"Jack of all Trades\" that he had come to plead\r\nfor. It gave me great joy to hear this, as the maid was as good a girl\r\nas could be, and I thought well of Jack; so on that day I gave her to\r\nhim. They were to have a large piece of ground to grow their crops on,\r\nwith a house to live in, and sheds for their goats.\r\n\r\nThe isle was now set out in this way: all the west end was left waste,\r\nso that if the wild men should land on it, they might come and go, and\r\nhurt no one. My old house I gave to the chief, with all its woods, which\r\nnow spread out as far as the creek, and the south end was for the white\r\nmen and their wives.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that there was one gift which I had not thought of, and\r\nthat was the book of God's Word, which I knew would give to those who\r\ncould feel the words in it, fresh strength for their work, and grace to\r\nbear the ills of life.\r\n\r\nNow that I had been in the isle quite a month, I once more set sail on\r\nthe fifth day of May; and all my friends told me that they should stay\r\nthere till I came to fetch them.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been out three days, though the sea was smooth and calm, we\r\nsaw that it was quite black on the land side; and as we knew not what to\r\nmake of it, I sent the chief mate up the main mast to find out with his\r\nglass what it could be. He said it was a fleet of scores and scores of\r\nsmall boats, full of wild men who came fast at us with fierce looks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we got near them, I gave word to furl all sails and stop the\r\nship, and as there was nought to fear from them but fire, to get the\r\nboats out and man them both well, and so wait for them to come up.\r\n\r\nIn this way we lay by for them, and in a short time they came up with\r\nus; but as I thought they would try to row round and so close us in, I\r\ntold the men in the boats not to let them come too near. This, though we\r\ndid not mean it, brought us to a fight with them, and they shot a cloud\r\nof darts at our boats. We did not fire at them, yet in half an hour they\r\nwent back out to sea, and then came straight to us, till we were so near\r\nthat they could hear us speak.\r\n\r\nI bade my men keep close, so as to be safe from their darts if they\r\nshould shoot, and get out the guns. I then sent Friday on deck, to call\r\nout to them in their own tongue and ask what they meant. It may be that\r\nthey did not know what he said, but as soon as he spoke to them I heard\r\nhim cry out that they would shoot. This was too true, for they let fly\r\na thick cloud of darts, and to my great grief poor Friday fell dead, for\r\nthere was no one else in their sight. He was shot with three darts, and\r\nthree more fell quite near him, so good was their aim.\r\n\r\nI was so mad with rage at the loss of my dear Friday, that I bade the\r\nmen load five guns with small shot, and four with large, and we gave\r\nthem such a fierce fire that in all their lives they could not have seen\r\none like it. Then a rare scene met our eyes: dread and fear came on them\r\nall, for their boats, which were small, were split and sunk--three or\r\nfour by one shot. The men who were not dead had to swim, and those who\r\nhad wounds were left to sink, for all the rest got off as fast as they\r\ncould. Our boat took up one poor man who had to swim for his life, when\r\nthe rest had fled for the space of half an hour. In three hours' time,\r\nwe could not see more than three or four of their boats, and as a breeze\r\nsprang up we set sail.\r\n\r\nAt first the man whom we took on board would not eat or speak, and we\r\nall had fears lest he should pine to death. But when we had taught him\r\nto say a few words, he told us that his friends--the wild men-had come\r\nout with their kin to have a great fight, and that all they meant was\r\nto make us look at the grand sight. So it was for this that poor Friday\r\nfell! He who had been as good and true to me as man could be! And now in\r\ndeep grief I must take my leave of him.\r\n\r\nWe went on with a fair wind to All Saints' Bay, and here I found a sloop\r\nthat I had brought with me from home, that I might send men and stores\r\nfor the use of my friends in the isle. I taught the mate how to find the\r\nplace, and when he came back, I found that he had done so with ease.\r\n\r\nOne of our crew had a great wish to go with the sloop, and live on the\r\nisle, if the chief would give him land to plant. So I told him he should\r\ngo by all means, and gave him the wild man for his slave. I found, too,\r\nthat a man who had come with his wife and child and three slaves, to\r\nhide from the king of Spain, would like to go, if he could have some\r\nland there, though he had but a small stock to take with him; so I put\r\nthem all on board the sloop, and saw them safe out of the bay, on their\r\nway to the isle. With them I sent three milch cows, five calves, a horse\r\nand a colt, all of which, as I heard, went safe and sound.\r\n\r\nI have now no more to say of my isle, as I had left it for the last\r\ntime, but my life in lands no less far from home was not yet at an end.\r\nFrom the Bay of All Saints we went straight to the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nHere I made up my mind to part from the ship in which I had come from\r\nthe Isle, and with two of the crew to stay on land, and leave the rest\r\nto go on their way. I soon made friends with some men from France, as\r\nwell as from my own land, and two Jews, who had come out to the Cape to\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nAs I found that some goods which I had brought with me from home were\r\nworth a great deal, I made a large sum by the sale of them. When we had\r\nbeen at the Cape of Good Hope for nine months, we thought that the best\r\nthing we could do would be to hire a ship, and sail to the Spice Isles,\r\nto buy cloves, so we got a ship, and men to work her, and set out. When\r\nwe had bought and sold our goods in the course of trade, we came back,\r\nand then set out once more; so that, in short, as we went from port to\r\nport, to and fro, I spent, from first to last, six years in this part of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nAt length we thought we would go and seek new scenes where we could get\r\nfresh gains. And a strange set of men we at last fell in with, as you\r\nwho read this tale will say when you look at the print in front of this\r\npage.\r\n\r\nWhen we had put on shore, we made friends with a man who got us a large\r\nhouse, built with canes, and a small kind of hut of the same near it.\r\nIt had a high fence of canes round it to keep out thieves, of whom, it\r\nseems, there are not a few in that land. The name of the town was Ching,\r\nand we found that the fair or mart which was kept there would not be\r\nheld for three or four months. So we sent our ship back to the Cape, as\r\nwe meant to stay in this part of the world for some time, and go from\r\nplace to place to see what sort of a land it was, and then come back to\r\nthe fair at Ching.\r\n\r\nWe first went to a town which it was well worth our while to see, and\r\nwhich must have been, as near as I can guess, quite in the heart of this\r\nland. It was built with straight streets which ran in cross lines.\r\n\r\nBut I must own, when I came home to the place of my birth, I was much\r\nstruck to hear my friends say such fine things of the wealth and trade\r\nof these parts of the world, for I saw and knew that the men were a mere\r\nherd or crowd of mean slaves. What is their trade to ours, or to that of\r\nFrance and Spain? What are their ports, with a few junks and barks, to\r\nour grand fleets? One of our large ships of war would sink all their\r\nships, one line of French troops would beat all their horse, and the\r\nsame may be said of their ports, which would not stand for one month\r\nsuch a siege as we could bring to bear on them.\r\n\r\nIn three weeks more we came to their chief town. When we had laid in a\r\nlarge stock of tea, shawls, fans, raw silks, and such like goods, we set\r\nout for the north. As we knew we should run all kinds of risks on our\r\nway, we took with us a strong force to act as a guard, and to keep us\r\nfrom the wild hordes who rove from place to place all through the land.\r\nSome of our men were Scots, who had come out to trade here, and had\r\ngreat wealth, and I was glad to join them, as it was by no means the\r\nfirst time that they had been here.\r\n\r\nWe took five guides with us, and we all put our coin in one purse, to\r\nbuy food on the way, and to pay the men who took charge of us. One of us\r\nwe chose out for our chief, to take the lead in case we should have to\r\nfight for our lives; and when the time came, we had no small need of\r\nhim. On the sides of all the roads, we saw men who made pots, cups,\r\npans, and such like ware, out of a kind of earth, which is, in fact, the\r\nchief trade in this part of the world.\r\n\r\nOne thing, the guide said he would show me, that was not to be seen in\r\nall the world else (and this, in good sooth, I could not sneer at, as\r\nI had done at most of the things I had seen here), and this was a house\r\nthat was built of a kind of ware, such as most plates and cups are made\r\nof. \"How big is it?\" said I, \"can we take it on the back of a horse?\"\r\n\"On a horse!\" said the guide, \"why, two score of men live in it.\" He\r\nthen took us to it, and I found that it was in truth a large house,\r\nbuilt with lath and the best ware that can be made out of earth. The\r\nsun shone hot on the walls, which were quite white, hard, and smooth as\r\nglass, with forms on them in blue paint. On the walls of the rooms were\r\nsmall square tiles of the best ware, with red, blue, and green paint of\r\nall shades and hues, in rare forms, done in good taste; and as they use\r\nthe same kind of earth to join the tiles with, you could not see where\r\nthe tiles met. The floors of the rooms were made of the same ware, and\r\nas strong as those we have at home; and the same may be said of the\r\nroofs, but they were of a dark shade. If we had had more time to spare,\r\nI should have been glad to have seen more of this house, for there were\r\nthe ponds for the fish, the walks, the yards, and courts, which were\r\nall made in the same way. This odd sight kept me from my friends for two\r\nhours, and when I had come up to them, I had to pay a fine to our chief,\r\nas they had to wait so long.\r\n\r\nIn two days more we came to the Great Wall, which was made as a fort\r\nto keep the whole land safe,--and a great work it is. It goes in a long\r\ntrack for miles and miles, where the rocks are so high and steep that\r\nno foe could climb them; or, if they did, no wall could stop them. The\r\nGreat Wall is as thick as it is high, and it turns and winds in all\r\nsorts of ways.\r\n\r\nWe now saw, for the first time, some troops of the hordes I spoke of,\r\nwho rove from place to place, to rob and kill all whom they meet with.\r\nThey know no real mode of war, or skill in fight. Each has a poor lean\r\nhorse, which is not fit to do good work. Our chief gave some of us leave\r\nto go out and hunt as they call it, and what was it but to hunt sheep!\r\nThese sheep are wild and swift of foot, but they will not run far, and\r\nyou are sure of sport when you start in the chase. They go in flocks of\r\na score, or two, and like true sheep, keep close when they fly. In this\r\nsort of chase it was our hap to meet with some two score of the wild\r\nhordes, but what sort of prey they had come to hunt I know not. As soon\r\nas they saw us, one of them blew some loud notes on a kind of horn, with\r\na sound that was quite new to me. We all thought this was to call their\r\nfriends round them, and so it was, for in a short time a fresh troop of\r\nthe same size came to join them; and they were all, as far as we could\r\njudge, a mile off. One of the Scots was with us, and as soon as he heard\r\nthe horn, he told us that we must lose no time, but draw up in line, and\r\ncharge them at once. We told him we would, if he would take the lead.\r\n\r\nThey stood still, and cast a wild gaze at us, like a mere crowd, drawn\r\nup in no line; but as soon as they saw us come at them, they let fly\r\ntheir darts, which did not hit us, for though their aim was true, they\r\nfell short of us. We now came to a halt to fire at them, and then went\r\nat full speed to fall on them sword in hand, for so the bold Scot that\r\nled us, told us to do.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we came up to them, they fled right and left. The sole stand\r\nmade was by three of them, who had a kind of short sword in their hands,\r\nand bows on their backs, and who did all they could to call all the rest\r\nback to them. The brave Scot rode close up to them, and with his gun\r\nthrew one off his horse, shot the next, and the third ran off, and this\r\nwas the end of our fight. All the bad luck we met with, was that the\r\nsheep that we had in chase got off. We had not a man hurt, but as for\r\nthe foe, five of them were dead, and not a few had wounds, while the\r\nrest fled at the mere noise of our guns.\r\n\r\nThus we went on our way from town to town, and now and then met some\r\nof these wild hordes, whom we had to fight and I need not add that each\r\ntime we had the best of the fray. At last we made our way to the chief\r\ntown of the North Seas at the end of a year, five months and three days,\r\nfrom the time when we left Ching. When I had been there six weeks, and\r\nhad bought some more goods; I took ship and set sail for the land of my\r\nbirth, which I had left, this time, for ten years, nine months and three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAnd now I must bring this tale of my life to a close, while at the age\r\nof three score years and twelve, I feel that the day is at hand, when\r\nI shall go forth on that sea of peace and love, which has no waves or\r\nshores but those of bliss that knows no end.",
