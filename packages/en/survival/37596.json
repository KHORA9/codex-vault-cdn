Therefore the writer asks to be\r\nexcused for expressing a preference for his own favored _Northwest_,\r\nand while claiming all praise for this noble expanse, he wishes still\r\nto be acknowledged as most devotedly an AMERICAN CITIZEN, who feels\r\nthe deepest interest in the prosperity of the whole country.\r\n\r\nHis fellow-laborers in the extensive field of Horticulture, who are\r\nscattered over the great Northwest, having called upon him for a work\r\non fruits which should be adapted to their wants, the author has for\r\nseveral years devoted himself to the task of collecting materials from\r\nwhich he is preparing a work upon AMERICAN POMOLOGY, of which this is\r\nto be the first volume.\r\n\r\nThe title has been adopted as the most appropriate, because the book\r\nis intended to be truly American in its character, and, though it may\r\nbe especially adapted to the wants of the Western States, great pains\r\nhave been taken to make it a useful companion to the orchardists of\r\nall portions of our country.\r\n\r\nWhen examining this volume, his friends are asked to look gently upon\r\nthe many faults they may find, and they are requested also to observe\r\nthe peculiarities by which this fruit book is characterized. Much to\r\nhis regret, the author found that it was considered necessary to the\r\ncompleteness of the volume, that the general subject of fruit-growing\r\nshould be treated in detail, and, therefore, introductory chapters\r\nwere prepared; whereas, he had set out simply to describe the fruits\r\nof our country. To this necessity, as it was considered by his\r\nfriends, the author yielded reluctantly, because he felt that this\r\nlabor had already been thoroughly done by his predecessors, whose\r\nvolumes were to be seen in the houses of all intelligent\r\nfruit-growers. From them he did not wish to borrow other men's ideas\r\nand language, and therefore undertook to write the whole anew, without\r\nany reference to printed books. But, of course, it is impossible to be\r\noriginal in treating such familiar and hackneyed topics as those which\r\nare discussed at every meeting of horticulturists all over the\r\ncountry, and which form the subject of the familiar discourse of the\r\ngreen-house and nursery, the potting-shed and the grafting-room, the\r\ngarden and the orchard.\r\n\r\nAfter the introductory chapters upon the general or leading topics\r\nconnected with fruit-culture and orcharding, the reader will find that\r\nespecial attention has been paid to the classification of the fruits\r\nunder consideration in this volume. Classification is the great need\r\nof our pomology, and, indeed, it is almost a new idea to many American\r\nreaders. The author has fully realized the difficulties attendant\r\nupon the undertaking, but its importance, and its growing necessity,\r\nwere considered sufficient to warrant the attempted innovation. It is\r\nhoped that American students of pomology will appreciate the efforts\r\nwhich have been made in their behalf. The formulæ which have been\r\nadopted may not prove to be the best, but it is believed that they\r\nwill render great assistance to those who desire to identify fruits;\r\nand that, at least, they may lead to a more perfect classification in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, with these simple formulæ, under which the fruits are\r\narranged, the student has only to decide as to which of the\r\nsub-divisions his specimen must be referred, and then seek among a\r\nlimited number for the description that shall correspond to his fruit,\r\nand the identification is made out.\r\n\r\nIn the systematic descriptions of fruits, the alphabetical succession\r\nof the names is used in each sub-division. An earnest endeavor has\r\nbeen made to be minute in the details without becoming prolix. A\r\nregular order is adopted for considering the several parts, and some\r\nnew or unusual characters are brought into requisition to aid in the\r\nidentification. Some of these characters appear to have been strangely\r\noverlooked by previous pomologists, though they are believed to be\r\npermanent and of considerable value in the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nIn deciding upon the selection of the names of fruits, the generally\r\nreceived rules of our Pomological Societies have been departed from in\r\na few instances, where good reasons were thought to justify differing\r\nfrom the authorities. Thus, when a given name has been generally\r\nadopted over a large extent of country, though different from that\r\nused by a previous writer, it has been selected as the title of the\r\nfruit in this work.\r\n\r\nTo avoid incumbering the pages, authorities for the nomenclature have\r\nnot been cited, except in a few instances, nor have numerous synonyms\r\nbeen introduced. Such only as are in common use have been given, and\r\nthose of foreign origin have been dropped.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the reader is particularly directed to the catalogue\r\nof fruits near the close of the volume, which also answers as the\r\nindex to those which are described in detail. This portion of the work\r\nhas cost an immense amount of labor and time, and, though making\r\nlittle display, will, it is hoped, prove very useful to the\r\norchardist. In it the names of fruits are presented in their\r\nalphabetical order, followed by information as to the average size,\r\nthe origin of the variety, its classification, from which are deduced\r\nits shape, flavor and modes of coloring; next is noted its season, and\r\nthen its quality. This last character is, of course, but the result of\r\nprivate judgment, and the estimate may differ widely from that of\r\nothers; the quality, too, it should be remembered, is here intended to\r\nbe the result of a consideration of many properties besides that of\r\nmere flavor.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue will furnish a great deal of information respecting the\r\nfruits it embraces. Unfortunately, it is not so full nor so complete\r\nas it should be, but it is offered as the result of many years'\r\nobservations, and is submitted for what it is worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.--It is but an act of common justice for an author to\r\nacknowledge his indebtedness to those who have aided him in his\r\nlabors, especially where, from the nature of the investigations, so\r\nmuch material has to be drawn from extrinsic sources. Upon the present\r\noccasion, instead of an extended parade of references to the\r\nproductions of other writers, which might be looked upon as rather\r\npedantic, it is preferred to make a general acknowledgment of the\r\nimportant assistance derived from many pomological authors of our own\r\ncountry and of Europe. Quotations are credited on the pages where they\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nBut the writer is also under great obligations to a host of\r\nco-laborers for the assistance they have kindly rendered him in the\r\ncollecting, and in the examination and identification of fruits. Such\r\nfriends he has happily found wherever he has turned in the pursuit of\r\nthese investigations, and there are others whom it has never been his\r\ngood fortune to meet face to face. To name them all would be\r\nimpossible. The contemplation of their favors sadly recalls memories\r\nof the departed, but it also revives pleasant associations of the\r\nbright spirits that are still usefully engaged in the numerous\r\npomological and horticultural associations of our country, which have\r\nbecome important agencies in the diffusion of valuable information in\r\nthis branch of study.\r\n\r\nTo all of his kind friends the author returns his sincere thanks.\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of hesitation in coming before the public, but\r\nsatisfied that he has made a contribution to the fund of human\r\nknowledge, this volume is presented to the Horticulturists of our\r\ncountry, for whom it was prepared by their friend and fellow-laborer,\r\n\r\n                                                  JNO.

THE PUTNAM LIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew persons have any idea of the great value and importance of the\r\nproducts of our orchards and fruit-gardens. These are generally\r\nconsidered the small things of agriculture, and are overlooked by all\r\nbut the statist, whose business it is to deal with these minutiæ, to\r\nhunt them up, to collocate them, and when he combines these various\r\ndetails and produces the sum total, we are all astonished at the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nOur government wisely provides for the gathering of statistics at\r\nintervals of ten years, and some of the States also take an account of\r\nstock and production at intermediate periods, some of them, like Ohio,\r\nhave a permanent statistician who reports annually to the Governor of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nOur Boards of Trade publish the amounts of the leading articles that\r\narrive at and depart from the principal cities, and thus they furnish\r\nus much additional information of value. Besides this, the county\r\nassessors are sometimes directed to collect statistics upon certain\r\npoints of interest, and now that we all contribute toward the\r\nextinction of the national debt, the United States Assessors in the\r\nseveral districts are put in possession of data, which should be very\r\ncorrect, in regard to certain productions that are specified by act of\r\nCongress as liable to taxation. By these several means we may have an\r\nopportunity of learning from time to time what are the productions of\r\nthe country, and their aggregate amounts are surprising to most of us.\r\nWhen they relate to our special interests, they are often very\r\nencouraging. This is particularly the case with those persons who have\r\nyielded to the popular prejudice that cotton was the main agricultural\r\nproduction of the United States; to such it will be satisfactory to\r\nlearn that the crop of corn, as reported in the last census, is of\r\nnearly equal value, at the usual market prices of each article.\r\nFruit-growers will be encouraged to find that the value of orchard\r\nproducts, according to the same returns, was nearly twenty millions,\r\nthat of Ohio being nearly one million; of New York, nearly three and\r\nthree-quarters millions; that the wine crop of the United States, an\r\ninterest that is still in its infancy, amounted to nearly three and\r\none-quarter millions; and that the valuation of market garden products\r\nsums up to more than sixteen millions of dollars' worth. It is to be\r\nregretted that for our present purpose, the data are not sufficiently\r\ndistinct to enable us to ascertain the relative value of the\r\nproductions of our orchards of apples, pears, peaches, quinces, and\r\nthe amount and value of the small fruits, as they are termed, since\r\nthese are variously grouped in the returns of the census takers, and\r\ncannot now be separated. Of their great value, however, we may draw\r\nour conclusions from separate records that have been kept and reported\r\nby individuals, who assert the products of vineyards in some cases to\r\nhave been as high as three thousand dollars per acre; of strawberries,\r\nat one thousand dollars; of pears, at one hundred dollars per tree,\r\nwhich would be four thousand dollars per acre; of apples, at\r\ntwenty-five bushels per tree, or one thousand bushels per acre, which,\r\nat fifty cents per bushel, would produce five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nBut, leaving this matter of dollars and cents, who will portray for us\r\nthe delights incident to fruit-culture? They are of a quiet nature,\r\nthough solid and enduring. They carry us back to the early days of the\r\nhistory of our race, when \"the Lord God planted a garden eastward in\r\nEden ... and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree\r\nthat is pleasant to the sight, and good for food ... and the Lord God\r\ntook the man and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it and to\r\nkeep it.\" We are left to infer that this dressing and keeping of the\r\ngarden was but a light and pleasant occupation, unattended with toil\r\nand trouble, and that in their natural condition the trees and\r\nplants, unaided by culture, yielded food for man. Those were\r\nparadisean times, the days of early innocence, when man, created in\r\nthe image of his Maker, was still obedient to the divine commands;\r\nbut, after the great transgression, everything was altered, the very\r\nground was cursed, \"thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee,\r\nand thou shalt eat of the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face\r\nshalt thou eat bread.\"----From that day to the present hour it has\r\nbeen the lot of man to struggle with difficulties in the cultivation\r\nof the soil, and he has been driven to the necessity of constant\r\nwatchfulness and care to preserve and to improve the various fruits of\r\nthe earth upon which he subsists. In the tropics, it is true, there\r\nare many vegetable productions which are adapted for human food, even\r\nin a state of nature, and there we find less necessity for the effort\r\nof ingenuity and the application of thought and labor to produce a\r\nsubsistence. Amid these productive _plants of nature_, the natives of\r\nsuch regions lead an idle life, and seldom rise above a low scale of\r\nadvancement; but in the temperate regions of the globe, where the\r\nunceasing effort of the inhabitants is required to procure their daily\r\nfood, we find the greatest development of human energies and\r\ningenuity--there man thinks, and works; there, indeed, he is forced to\r\nimprove the natural productions of the earth--and there we shall find\r\nhim progressing. As with everything else, so it is with fruits, some\r\nof which were naturally indifferent or even inedible, until subjected\r\nto the meliorating influences of high culture, of selection, and of\r\nimprovement. Here we find our _plants of culture_, which so well repay\r\nthe labor and skill bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the early periods of the history of our race, while men were\r\nnomadic and wandered from place to place, little attention was paid to\r\nany department of agricultural improvement, and still less care was\r\nbestowed upon horticulture. Indeed, it can scarcely be supposed that,\r\nunder such conditions, either branch of the art could have existed,\r\nany more than they are now found among the wandering hordes of Tartars\r\non the steppes of Asia. So soon, however, as men began to take\r\npossession of the soil by a more permanent tenure, agriculture and\r\nhorticulture also, attracted their chief attention, and were soon\r\ndeveloped into arts of life. With advancing civilization, this has\r\nbeen successively more and more the case; the producing art being\r\nobliged to keep pace with the increased number of consumers, greater\r\ningenuity was required and was applied to the production of food for\r\nthe teeming millions of human beings that covered the earth, and, as\r\nwe find, in China, at the present time, the greatest pains were taken\r\nto make the earth yield her increase.\r\n\r\nHigh civilization demands high culture of the soil, and agriculture\r\nbecomes an honored pursuit, with every department of art and science\r\ncoming to its assistance. At the same time, and impelled by the same\r\nnecessities, supported and aided by the same co-adjutors, horticulture\r\nalso advances in a similar ratio, and, from its very nature, assumes\r\nthe rank of a fine art, being less essential than pure agriculture,\r\nand in some of its branches being rather an ornamental than simply a\r\nuseful art. It is not admitted, however, that any department of\r\nhorticulture is to be considered useless, and many of its applications\r\nare eminently practical, and result in the production of vast\r\nquantities of human food of the most valuable kind. This pursuit\r\nalways marks the advancement of a community.--As our western pioneers\r\nprogress in their improvements from the primitive log cabins to the\r\nmore elegant and substantial dwelling houses, we ever find the garden\r\nand the orchard, the vine-arbor and the berry-patch taking their\r\nplaces beside the other evidences of progress. These constitute to\r\nthem the poetry of common life, of the farmer's life.\r\n\r\nThe culture of fruits, and gardens also, contributes in no small\r\ndegree to the improvement of a people by the excellent moral influence\r\nit exercises upon them. Everything that makes home attractive must\r\ncontribute to this desirable end. Beyond the sacred confines of the\r\nhappy hearthstone, with its dear familiar circle, there can be no more\r\npleasant associations than those of the garden, where, in our tender\r\nyears, we have aided loved parents, from them taking the first lessons\r\nin plant-culture, gathering the luscious fruits of their planting or\r\nof our own; nor of the rustic arbor, in whose refreshing shade we have\r\nreclined to rest and meditate amid its sheltering canopy of verdure,\r\nand where we have gathered the purple berries of the noble vine at a\r\nlater period of the rolling year; nor of the orchard, with its\r\nbounteous supplies of golden and ruddy apples, blushing peaches, and\r\nmelting pears. With such attractions about our homes, with such ties\r\nto be sundered, it is wonderful, and scarcely credible, that youth\r\nshould ever be induced to wander from them, and to stray into paths of\r\nevil. Such happy influences must have a good moral effect upon the\r\nyoung. If it be argued that such luxuries will tend to degrade our\r\nmorals by making us effeminate and sybaritic, or that such enjoyments\r\nmay become causes of envy and consequent crime on the part of those\r\nwho are less highly favored, it may be safely asserted that there is\r\nno better cure for fruit-stealing, than to give presents of fruit, and\r\nespecially of fruit-trees, to your neighbors, particularly to the\r\nboys--encourage each to plant and to cherish his own tree, and he will\r\nsoon learn the meaning of _meum_ and _tuum_, and will appreciate the\r\nbeauties of the moral code, which he will be all the more likely to\r\nrespect in every other particular.\r\n\r\nSome of the legislation of our country is a very curious relic of\r\nbarbarism. According to common law, that which is attached to the\r\nsoil, may be removed without a breach of propriety, by one who is not\r\nan owner of the fee simple; thus, such removal of a vegetable product\r\ndoes not constitute theft or larceny, but simply amounts to a\r\ntrespass: whereas the taking of fruit from the ground beneath the\r\ntree, even though it be defective or decaying, is considered a theft.\r\nAn unwelcome intruder, or an unbidden guest, may enter our orchard,\r\ngarden, or vineyard, and help himself at his pleasure to any of our\r\nfruits, which we have been most carefully watching and nursing tor\r\nmonths upon trees, for the fruitage of which we may have been laboring\r\nand waiting for years, and, forsooth, our only recourse is to sue him\r\nat the law, and our only satisfaction, after all the attendant\r\nannoyance and expense, is a paltry fine for _trespass_ upon our\r\nfreehold, which, of course, is not commensurate with our estimate of\r\nthe value of the articles taken: fruits often possess, in the eyes of\r\nthe devoted orchardist, a real value much beyond their market price.\r\n\r\nWere I asked to describe the location of the fabled fountain of\r\nHygeia, I should decide that it was certainly situated in an orchard;\r\nit must have come bubbling from earth that sustained the roots of tree\r\nand vine; it must have been shaded by the umbrageous branches of the\r\nwide-spreading apple and pear, and it was doubtless approached by\r\nalleys that were lined by peach trees laden with their downy fruit,\r\nand over-arched by vines bearing rich clusters of the luscious grape,\r\nand they were garnished at their sides by the crimson strawberry. Such\r\nat least would have been an appropriate setting for so valued a jewel\r\nas the fountain of health, and it is certain that the pursuit of\r\nfruit-growing is itself conducive to the possession of that priceless\r\nblessing. The physical as well as the moral qualities of our nature\r\nare wonderfully promoted by these cares. The vigorous exercise they\r\nafford us in the open air, the pleasant excitement, the expectation of\r\nthe results of the first fruits of our plants, tending, training and\r\ncultivating them the while, are all so many elements conducive to the\r\nhighest enjoyment of full health.\r\n\r\nThe very character of the food furnished by our orchards should be\r\ntaken into the account, in making up our estimate of their\r\ncontributions to the health of a community. From them we procure\r\naliment of the most refined character, and it has been urged that the\r\nelements of which they are composed are perfected or refined to the\r\nhighest degree of organization that is possible to occur in vegetable\r\ntissues. Such pabulum is not only gratefully refreshing, but it is\r\nsatisfying--without being gross, it is nutritious. The antiscorbutic\r\neffects of ripe fruits, especially those that are acid, are\r\nproverbial, and every fever patient has appreciated the relief derived\r\nfrom those that are acidulous. Then as a preventive of the febrile\r\naffections peculiar to a miasmatic region, the free use of acid\r\nfruits, or even of good sound vinegar made from grapes or apples, is\r\nan established fact in medical practice--of which, by the by,\r\nprevention is always the better part.\r\n\r\nApples were esteemed an important and valuable article of food in the\r\ndays of the Romans, for all school boys have read in the ore rotundo\r\nof his own flowing measures, what Virgil has said, so much better than\r\nhis tame translator:\r\n\r\n    \"New cheese and chestnuts are our country fare,\r\n    With mellow apples for your welcome cheer.\"\r\n\r\nBut in more modern times, beside their wonted use as dessert fruit, or\r\nevening feast, or cooked in various modes, a French economist \"has\r\ninvented and practiced with great success a method of making bread\r\nwith common apples, which is said to be very far superior to\r\npotato-bread. After having boiled one-third part of peeled apples, he\r\nbruised them while quite warm into two-thirds parts of flour,\r\nincluding the proper quantity of yeast, and kneaded the whole without\r\nwater, the juice of the fruit being quite sufficient; he put the mass\r\ninto a vessel in which he allowed it to rise for about twelve hours.\r\nBy this process he obtained a very excellent bread, full of eyes, and\r\nextremely light and palatable.\"[1]\r\n\r\nNor is this class of food desirable for man alone. Fruits of all\r\nkinds, but particularly what may be called the large fruits, such as\r\nare grown in our orchards, may be profitably cultivated for feeding\r\nour domestic animals. Sweet apples have been especially recommended\r\nfor fattening swine, and when fed to cows they increase the flow of\r\nmilk, or produce fat according to the condition of these animals.\r\nThink of the luxury of eating apple-fed pork! Why, even the strict\r\nRabbi might overcome his prejudices against such swine flesh! And then\r\ndream of enjoying the luxury of fresh rich milk, yellow cream, and\r\ngolden butter, from your winter dairy, instead of the sky-blue fluid,\r\nand the pallid, or an anotto-tinted, but insipid butter, resulting\r\nfrom the meager supplies of nutriment contained in dry hay and\r\nfibrous, woody cornstalks. Now this is not unreasonable nor\r\nridiculous. Orchards have been planted with a succession of sweet\r\napples that will sustain swine in a state of most perfect health,\r\ngrowing and fattening simultaneously from June to November; and the\r\nlater varieties may be cheaply preserved for feeding stock of all\r\nkinds during the winter, when they will be best prepared by steaming,\r\nand may be fed with the greatest advantage. Our farmers do not\r\nappreciate the benefits of having green food for their animals during\r\nthe winter season. Being blessed with that royal grain, the Indian\r\ncorn, they do not realize the importance of the provision of roots\r\nwhich is so great a feature in British husbandry; but they have yet to\r\nlearn, and they will learn, that for us, and under our conditions of\r\nlabor and climate, they can do still better, and produce still greater\r\nresults with a combination of _hay_ or _straw_, _corn meal_ and\r\n_apples_, all properly prepared by means of steam or hot water.\r\nBesides, such orchards may be advantageously planted in many places\r\nwhere the soil is not adapted to the production of grain.--The reader\r\nis referred to the chapter on select lists in another part of this\r\nvolume, in which an attempt will be made to present the reader with\r\nthe opinions of the best pomologists of various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIt were an interesting and not unprofitable study to trace the various\r\nsources and routes by which fruits have been introduced into different\r\nparts of our extended country. In some cases we should find that we\r\nwere indebted for these luxuries to the efforts of very humble\r\nindividuals, while in other regions the high character of the orchards\r\nis owing to the forethought, knowledge, enterprise, and liberality of\r\nsome prominent citizen of the infant community, who has freely spent\r\nhis means and bestowed his cares in providing for others as well as\r\nfor his own necessities or pleasures. But it is to the intelligent\r\nnurserymen of our country that we are especially indebted for the\r\nuniversal diffusion of fruits, and for the selection of the best\r\nvarieties in each different section. While acting separately, these\r\nmen were laboring under great disadvantages, and frequently cultivated\r\ncertain varieties under a diversity of names, as they had received\r\nthem from various sources. This was a difficulty incident to their\r\nisolation, but the organization of Pomological Societies in various\r\nparts of the country, has enabled them in a great measure to unravel\r\nthe confusion of an extended synonymy, and also by comparison and\r\nconsultation with the most intelligent fruit-growers, they have been\r\nprepared to advise the planter as to the best and most profitable\r\nvarieties to be set out in different soils and situations.\r\n\r\nMost of our first orchards were planted with imported trees. The\r\ncolonists brought plants and seeds. Even now, in many parts of the\r\ncountry, we hear many good fruits designated as English, to indicate\r\nthat they are considered superior to the native; and we are still\r\nimporting choice varieties from Europe and other quarters of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe roving tribes of Indians who inhabited this country when\r\ndiscovered and settled by the whites, had no orchards--they lived by\r\nthe chase, and only gathered such fruits as were native to the soil.\r\nAmong the earliest attempts to civilize them, however, those that\r\nexerted the greatest influence, were efforts to make them an\r\nagricultural people, and of these the planting of fruit-trees was one\r\nof the most successful. In many parts of the country we find relics of\r\nthese old Indian orchards still remaining, and it is probable that\r\nfrom the apple seeds sent by the general government for distribution\r\namong the Cherokees in Georgia, we are now reaping some of the most\r\nvaluable fruits of this species. The early French settlers were famous\r\ntree-planters, and we find their traces across the continent, from the\r\nSt. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico. These consist in noble pear and\r\napple trees, grown from seeds planted by them, at their early and\r\nscattered posts or settlements. These were made far in advance of the\r\npioneers, who have, at a later period, formed the van of civilization,\r\nthat soon spread into a solid phalanx in its march throughout the\r\ngreat interior valley of the continent.\r\n\r\nOn the borders of civilization we sometimes meet with a singular\r\nbeing, more savage than polished, and yet useful in his way. Such an\r\none in the early settlement of the northwestern territory was Johnny\r\nApple-seed--a simple-hearted being, who loved to roam through the\r\nforests in advance of his fellows, consorting, now with the red man,\r\nnow with the white, a sort of connecting link--by his white brethren\r\nhe was, no doubt, considered rather a vagabond, for we do not learn\r\nthat he had the industry to open farms in the wilderness, the energy\r\nto be a great hunter, nor the knowledge and devotion to have made him\r\na useful missionary among the red men. But Johnny had his use in the\r\nworld. It was his universal custom, when among the whites, to save the\r\nseeds of all the best apples he met with. These he carefully preserved\r\nand carried with him, and when far away from his white friends, he\r\nwould select an open spot of ground, prepare the soil, and plant these\r\nseeds, upon the principle of the old Spanish custom, that he owed so\r\nmuch to posterity, so that some day, the future traveler or inhabitant\r\nof those fertile valleys, might enjoy the fruits of his early efforts.\r\nSuch was Johnny Apple-seed--did he not erect for himself monuments\r\nmore worthy, if not more enduring, than piles of marble or statues of\r\nbrass?\r\n\r\nIn tracing the progress of fruits through different portions of our\r\ncountry, we should very naturally expect to find the law that governs\r\nthe movements of men, applying with equal force to the fruits they\r\ncarry with them. The former have been observed to migrate very nearly\r\non parallels of latitude, so have, in a great degree, the latter; and\r\nwhenever we find a departure from this order, we may expect to\r\ndiscover a change, and sometimes a deterioration in the characters of\r\nthe fruits thus removed to a new locality. It is true, much of this\r\nalteration, whether improvement or otherwise, may be owing to the\r\ndifference of soil. Western New York received her early fruits from\r\nConnecticut, and Massachusetts; Michigan, Northern Illinois, and\r\nlater, Wisconsin and Iowa received theirs in a great degree from New\r\nYork. Ohio and Indiana received their fruits mainly from New Jersey,\r\nand Pennsylvania, and we may yet trace this in the prevalence of\r\ncertain leading varieties that are scarcely known, and very little\r\ngrown on different parallels. The early settlement at the mouth of the\r\nMuskingum river, was made by New England-men, and into the\r\n\"Ohio-purchase,\" they introduced the leading varieties of the apples\r\nof Massachusetts. Among these, the Boston or Roxbury Russet was a\r\nprominent favorite, but it was so changed in its appearance as\r\nscarcely to be recognized by its old admirers, and it was christened\r\nwith a new name, the Putnam Russet, under the impression that it was a\r\ndifferent variety. Most of the original Putnam varieties have\r\ndisappeared from the orchards. Kentucky received her fruits in great\r\nmeasure from Virginia; Tennessee from the same source and from North\r\nCarolina, and these younger States sent them forward on the great\r\nwestern march with their hardy sons to southern Indiana, southern\r\nIllinois, to Missouri, and to Arkansas, in all which regions we find\r\nevident traces in the orchards, of the origin of the people who\r\nplanted them.\r\n\r\nOf course, we shall find many deflections from the precise parallel of\r\nlatitude, some inclining to the south, and many turning to the\r\nnorthward. To the latter we of the West are looking with the greatest\r\ninterest, since we so often find that the northern fruits do not\r\nmaintain their high characters in their southern or southwestern\r\nmigrations, and all winter kinds are apt to become autumnal in their\r\nperiod of ripening, which makes them less valuable; and because, among\r\nthose from a southern origin, we have discovered many of high merit as\r\nto beauty, flavor, and productiveness--and, especially where they are\r\nable to mature sufficiently, they prove to be long keepers, thus\r\nsupplying a want which was not filled by fruits of a northern origin.\r\nThere may be limits beyond which we cannot transport some sorts to\r\nadvantage in either direction, but this too will depend very much upon\r\nthe adaptability of our soils to particular varieties.\r\n\r\nIn every region where fruit has been cultivated we find local\r\nvarieties grown from seed, many of these are of sufficient merit to\r\nwarrant their propagation, and it behooves us to be constantly on the\r\nlook out for them; for though our lists are already sufficiently large\r\nto puzzle the young orchardist in making his selections, we may well\r\nreduce the number by weeding out more of the indifferent fruit, at the\r\nsame time that we are introducing those of a superior character. It\r\nhas been estimated that there may be as many as one in ten of our\r\nseedling orchard trees that would be ranked as \"good,\" but not one in\r\na hundred that could be styled \"best.\"[2] Certain individuals have\r\ndevoted themselves to the troublesome though thankless office of\r\ncollecting these scattered varieties of decided merit, and from their\r\ncollections our pomological societies will, from time to time, select\r\nand recommend the best for more extended cultivation. Such devoted men\r\nas H.N. Gillett, Lewis Jones, Reuben Ragan, A.H. Ernst, who have been\r\nindustriously engaged in this good work for a quarter of a century,\r\nare entitled to the highest commendation; but there are many others\r\nwho have contributed their full share of benefits by their labors in\r\nthe same field, to whom also we owe a debt of gratitude. Two of the\r\nchief foci in the Ohio valley from which valuable fruits have been\r\ndistributed most largely, were the settlement at the mouth of the\r\nMuskingum, with its Putnam list given below; and a later, but very\r\nimportant introduction of choice fruits, brought into the Miami\r\ncountry by Silas Wharton, a nurseryman from Pennsylvania, who settled\r\namong a large body of the religious Society of Friends, in Warren Co.,\r\nOhio. The impress of this importation is very manifest in all the\r\ncountry, within a radius of one hundred miles, and some of his fruits\r\nare found doing well in the northwestern part of the State of Ohio, in\r\nnorthern Indiana, and in an extended region westward.\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, many other local foci, whence good fruits have\r\nradiated to bless regions more or less extensive, and in every\r\nneighborhood we find the name of some early pomologist attached to the\r\ngood fruits that he had introduced, thus adding another synonym to the\r\nnumerous list of those belonging to so many of our good varieties.\r\n\r\nA.W. Putnam commenced an apple nursery in 1794, a few years after the\r\nfirst white settlement at Marietta, Ohio, the first grafts were set in\r\nthe spring of 1796; they were obtained from Connecticut by Israel\r\nPutnam, and were the first set in the State, and grafted by W. Rufus\r\nPutnam. Most of the early orchards of the region were planted from\r\nthis nursery. These grafts were taken from the orchard of Israel\r\nPutnam (of wolf-killing memory) in Pomfret, Connecticut. In the Ohio\r\nCultivator for August 1st, 1846, may be found the following authentic\r\nlist of the varieties propagated:--\r\n\r\n  \"1. Putnam Russet, (Roxbury.)\r\n   2.

RUNNING OUT OF VARIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attempting to trace out the history of any plant that has long been\r\nsubjected to the dominion of man, we are beset with difficulties\r\ngrowing out of the uncertainty of language, and arising also from the\r\nabsence of precise terms of science in the descriptions or allusions\r\nwhich we meet respecting them. As he who would investigate the\r\nhistory of our great national grain crop, the noble Indian maize,\r\nwhich, in our language, claims the generic term corn, will at once\r\nmeet with terms apt to mislead him in the English translation of the\r\nBible, and in the writings of Europeans, who use the word corn in a\r\ngeneric sense, as applying to all the edible grains, and especially to\r\nwheat--so in this investigation we may easily be misled by meeting the\r\nword apple in the Bible and in the translations of Latin and Greek\r\nauthors, and we may be permitted to question whether the original\r\nwords translated apple may not have been applied to quite different\r\nfruits, or perhaps we may ask whether our word may not originally have\r\nhad a more general sense, meaning as it does, according to its\r\nderivation, any round body.\r\n\r\nThe etymology of the word apple is referred by the lexicographers to\r\n_abhall_, Celtic; _avall_, Welsh; _afall_ or _avall_, Armoric; _aval_\r\nor _avel_, Cornish; and these are all traceable to the Celtic word\r\n_ball_, meaning simply a round body.\r\n\r\nWorcester traces the origin of apple directly to the German _apfel_,\r\nwhich he derives from _æpl_, _apel_, or _appel_.\r\n\r\nWebster cites the Saxon _appl_ or _appel_; Dutch, _appel_; German,\r\n_apfel_; Danish, _æble_; Swedish, _aple_; Welsh, _aval_; Irish,\r\n_abhal_ or _ubhal_; Armoric, _aval_; Russian, _yabloko_.\r\n\r\nIts meaning being fruit in general, with a round form. Thus the\r\nPersian word _ubhul_ means Juniper berries, and in Welsh the word used\r\nmeans other fruits, and needs a qualifying term to specify the variety\r\nor kind.\r\n\r\nHogg, in his British Pomology, quoting Owen, says, the ancient\r\nGlastonbury was called by the Britons _Ynys avallac_ or _avallon_,\r\nmeaning an apple orchard, and from this came the Roman word\r\n_avallonia_, from this he infers that the apple was known to the\r\nBritons before the advent of the Romans. We are told, that in 973,\r\nKing Edgar, when fatigued with the labors of the chase, laid himself\r\ndown under a wild apple tree, so that it becomes a question whether\r\nthis plant was not a native of England as of other parts of Europe,\r\nwhere in many places it is found growing wild and apparently\r\nindigenous. Thornton informs us in his history of Turkey, that apples\r\nare common in Wallachia, and he cites among the varieties one, the\r\n_domniasca_, \"which is perhaps the finest in Europe, both for its\r\nsize, color, and flavor.\" It were hard to say what variety this is,\r\nand whether it be known to us.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of this word apple in the Bible is attributable to\r\nthe translators, and some commentators suggest that they have used it\r\nin its general sense, and that in the following passages where it\r\noccurs, it refers to the citron, orange, or some other subtropical\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n\"Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples.\"--Songs of Solomon ii,\r\n5.\r\n\r\n\"As the apple-tree (citron) among the trees of the wood, * * * I sat\r\nme down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet\r\nto my taste.\"--Sol. ii, 2.\r\n\r\n* * * \"I raised thee up under the apple-tree.\"--Solomon viii, 5.\r\n\r\n\"A word fitly spoken, is like apples of gold in pictures of\r\nsilver.\"--Prov. xxv, 11.\r\n\r\nThe botanical position of the cultivated apple may be stated as\r\nfollows:--Order, _Rosaceæ_; sub-order, _Pomeæ_; or the apple family\r\nand genus, _Pyrus_. The species under our consideration is the _Pyrus\r\nMalus_, or apple. It has been introduced into this country from\r\nEurope, and is now found in a half-wild state, springing up in old\r\nfields, hedge-rows, and roadsides; but, even in such situations, by\r\ntheir eatable fruit and broad foliage, and by the absence of spiny or\r\nthorny twigs, the trees generally give evidence of a civilized origin.\r\nIt is not that the plant has changed any of its true specific\r\ncharacters, but that it has been affected by the meliorating\r\ninfluences of culture, which it has not been able entirely to shake\r\noff in its neglected condition. Sometimes, indeed, trees are found in\r\nthese neglected and out-of-the-way situations, which produce fruits of\r\nsuperior quality--and the sorts have been gladly introduced into our\r\nnurseries and orchards.\r\n\r\nVery early in the history of horticulture the apple attracted\r\nattention by its improvability, showing that it belonged to the class\r\nof culture-plants. Indeed it is a very remarkable fact in the study of\r\nbotany, and the pivot upon which the science and art of horticulture\r\nturns, that while there are plants which show no tendency to change\r\nfrom their normal type, even when brought under the highest culture,\r\nand subjected to every treatment which human ingenuity can suggest,\r\nthere are others which are prone to variations or sports, even in\r\ntheir natural condition, but more so when they are carefully nursed by\r\nthe prudent farmer or gardener. These may be called respectively the\r\nplants of nature and the plants of culture. Some of the former furnish\r\nhuman food, and are otherwise useful to man; but the latter class\r\nembraces by far the larger number of food-plants, and we are indebted\r\nto this pliancy, aided by human skill, for our varieties of fruits,\r\nour esculent vegetables, and the floral ornaments of our gardens.\r\n\r\nThe native country of the apple, though not definitively settled, is\r\ngenerally conceded to be Europe, particularly its southern portions,\r\nand perhaps Western Asia: that is, the plant known and designated by\r\nbotanists as _Pyrus Malus_, for there are other and distinct species\r\nin America and Asia which have no claims to having been the source of\r\nour favorite orchard fruits. Our own native crab is the _Pyrus\r\ncoronaria_, which, though showing some slight tendency to variation,\r\nhas never departed from the strongly marked normal type. The _P.\r\nbaccata_, or Siberian crab, is so distinctly marked as to be admitted\r\nas a species. It has wonderfully improved under culture, and has\r\nproduced some quite distinct varieties; it has even been hybridized by\r\nMr. Knight, with the cultivated sorts of the common Wilding or Crab of\r\nEurope, the _P. Malus_. Pallas, who found it wild near Lake Baikal and\r\nin Daouria, says, it grows only 3 or 4 feet high, with a trunk of as\r\nmany inches diameter, and yields pear-shaped berries as large as peas.\r\n\r\nThe _P. rivularis_, according to Nuttall, is common in the maritime\r\nportions of Oregon, in alluvial forests. The tree attains a height of\r\n15 to 25 feet. It resembles the Siberian Crab, to which it has a close\r\naffinity. The fruit grows in clusters, is purple, scarcely the size of\r\na cherry, and of an agreeable flavor; sweetish and sub-acid when ripe,\r\nnot at all acid and acerb as the _P. coronaria_.[3]\r\n\r\nAmong the early writers upon the subject of pomology, we find some\r\nvery crude notions, particularly in regard to the wonderful powers of\r\nthe grafter, for this art of improving the Wilding by inserting buds\r\nor scions of better sorts, and thus multiplying trees of good kinds,\r\nwas a very ancient invention. Pliny, the naturalist, certainly\r\ndeserves our praise for his wonderful and comprehensive industry in\r\nall branches of natural history. In regard to grafting, which seems to\r\nhave been well understood in his day, he says, that he had seen near\r\nThuliæ a tree bearing all manner of fruits, nuts and berries, figs and\r\ngrapes, pears and pomegranates; no kind of apple or other fruit that\r\nwas not to be found on this tree. It is quaintly noted, however, that\r\n\"this tree did not live long,\"--is it to be wondered that such should\r\nhave been the case? Now some persons may object to the testimony of\r\nthis remarkable man, and feel disposed to discredit the statement of\r\nwhat appears so incredible to those who are at all acquainted with the\r\nwell-known necessity for a congenial stock into which the graft should\r\nbe inserted. But a more extended knowledge of the subject, would\r\nexplain what Pliny has recorded as a marvel of the art. The same thing\r\nhas been done in our own times, it is a trick, and one which would\r\nvery soon be detected now-a-days by the merest tyro in horticulture,\r\nthough it may have escaped the scrutiny of Pliny, whose business it\r\nwas to note and record the results of his observations, rather than to\r\nexamine the modus of the experiment. By the French, the method is\r\ncalled Charlatan grafting, and is done by taking a stock of suitable\r\nsize, hollowing it out, and introducing through its cavity several\r\nstocks of different kinds, upon each of which may be produced a\r\ndifferent sort of fruit, as reported by Pliny. The needed affinity of\r\nthe scion and stock, and the possible range that may be successfully\r\ntaken in this mode of propagation, with the whole consideration of the\r\ninfluence of the stock upon the graft, will be more fully discussed in\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\nThough it be claimed and even admitted that the wild apple or crab was\r\noriginally a native of Britain, and though it be well known that many\r\nvarieties have originated from seed in that country, still it appears\r\nfrom their own historians that the people introduced valuable\r\nvarieties from abroad. Thus we find in Fuller's account, that in the\r\n16th year of the reign of Henry VIII, Pippins were introduced into\r\nEngland by Lord Maschal, who planted them at Plumstead, in Sussex.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the celebrated Golden Pippin was originated at Perham\r\nPark, in Sussex, and this variety has attained a high meed of praise\r\nin that country and in Europe, though it has never been considered so\r\nfine in this country as some of our own seedlings. Evelyn says, in\r\n1685, at Lord Clarendon's seat, at Swallowfield, Berks, there is an\r\norchard of one thousand golden and other cider Pippins.[4] The Ribston\r\nPippin, which every Englishman will tell you is the best apple in the\r\nworld, was a native of Ribston Park, Yorkshire. Hargrave says: \"This\r\nplace is remarkable for the produce of a delicious apple, called the\r\nRibston Park Pippin.\" The original tree was raised from a Pippin\r\nbrought from France.[5] This apple is well-known in this country, but\r\nnot a favorite.\r\n\r\nAt a later period, 1597, John Gerard issued in an extensive folio his\r\nHistory of Plants, in which he mentions seven kinds of Pippins. The\r\nfollowing is given as a sample of the pomology of that day:--\r\n\r\n\"The fruit of apples do differ in greatnesse, forme, colour, and\r\ntaste, some covered with red skin, others yellow or greene, varying\r\ninfinitely according to soil and climate; some very greate, some very\r\nlittle, and many of middle sort; some are sweet of taste, or something\r\nsoure, most be of middle taste between sweet and soure; the which to\r\ndistinguish, I think it impossible, notwithstanding I heare of one who\r\nintendeth to write a peculiar volume of apples and the use of them.\"\r\nHe further says: \"The tame and grafted apple trees are planted and set\r\nin gardens and orchards made for that purpose; they delight to growe\r\nin good fertile grounds. Kent doth abounde with apples of most sortes;\r\nbut I have seen pastures and hedge-rows about the grounds of a\r\nworshipful gentleman dwelling two miles from Hereford, so many trees\r\nof all sortes, that the seruantes drinke for the moste parte no other\r\ndrinke but that which is made of apples. * * * Like as there be divers\r\nmanured apples, so is there sundry wilde apples or crabs, not\r\nhusbanded, that is, not grafted.\" He also speaks of the Paradise,\r\nwhich is probably the same we now use as a dwarfing stock.\r\n\r\nDr. Gerard fully appreciated the value of fruits, and thus vehemently\r\nurges his countrymen to plant orchards: \"Gentlemen, that have land and\r\nliving, put forward, * * * * * graft, set, plant, and nourish up trees\r\nin every corner of your grounds; the labor is small, the cost is\r\nnothing, the commoditie is great, yourselves shall have plentie, the\r\npoor shall have somewhat in time of want to relieve their necessitie,\r\nand God shall reward your good minde and diligence.\" The same author\r\ngives us a peculiar use of the apple which may be interesting to some\r\nwho never before associated _pomatum_ with the products of the\r\norchard. He recommends apples as a cosmetic. \"There is made an\r\nointment with the pulp of apples, and swine's grease and rose water,\r\nwhich is used to beautify the face and to take away the roughness of\r\nthe skin; it is called in shops _pomatum_, of the apples whereof it is\r\nmade.\"[6] When speaking of the importance of grafting to increase the\r\nnumber of trees of any good variety, Virgil advises to\r\n\r\n                    \"Graft the tender shoot,\r\n    Thy children's children shall enjoy the fruit.\"\r\n\r\nSo high an estimate did Pliny have of this fruit, that he asserted\r\nthat \"there are apples that have ennobled the countries from whence\r\nthey came, and many apples have immortalized their first founders and\r\ninventors. Our best apples will immortalize their first grafters\r\nforever; such as took their names from Manlius, Cestius, Matius, and\r\nClaudius.\"--Of the Quince apple, he says, that came of a quince being\r\ngrafted upon the apple stock, which \"smell like the quince, and were\r\ncalled _Appiana_, after Appius, who was the first that practiced this\r\nmode of grafting. Some are so red that they resemble blood, which is\r\ncaused by their being grafted upon the mulberry stock. Of all the\r\napples, the one which took its name from Petisius, was the most\r\nexcellent for eating, both on account of its sweetness and its\r\nagreeable flavor.\" Pliny mentions twenty-nine kinds of apples\r\ncultivated in Italy, about the commencement of the Christian Era.[7]\r\n\r\nAlas! for human vanity and apple glory! Where are now these boasted\r\nsorts, upon whose merits the immortality of their inventors and first\r\ngrafters was to depend? They have disappeared from our lists to give\r\nplace to new favorites, to some of which, perhaps, we are disposed to\r\naward an equally high meed of praise, that will again be ignored in a\r\nfew fleeting years, when higher skill and more scientific applications\r\nof knowledge shall have produced superior fruit to any of those we now\r\nprize so highly; and this is a consummation to which we may all look\r\nforward with pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn this country the large majority of our favorite fruits, of whatever\r\nspecies or kind, seem to have originated by accident, that is, they\r\nhave been discovered in seedling orchards, or even in hedge-rows.\r\nThese have no doubt, however, been produced by accidental crosses of\r\ngood kinds, and this may occur through the intervention of insects in\r\nany orchard of good fruit, where there may chance to be some varieties\r\nthat have the tendency to progress. The discoveries of Linnæus, and\r\nhis doctrine of the sexual characters of plants, created quite a\r\nrevolution in botany, and no doubt attracted the attention of Lord\r\nBacon, who was a close observer of nature, for he ventured to guess\r\nthat there might be such a thing as crossing the breeds of plants,\r\nwhen he says:--\"The compounding or mixture of kinds in plants is not\r\nfound out, which, nevertheless, if it be possible, is more at command\r\nthan that of living creatures; wherefore it were one of the most\r\nnoteable experiments touching plants to find it out, for so you may\r\nhave great variety of new fruits and flowers yet unknown. Grafting\r\ndoes it not, that mendeth the fruit or doubleth the flowers, etc., but\r\nhath not the power to make a new kind, for the scion ever overruleth\r\nthe stock.\" In which last observation he shows more knowledge and a\r\ndeeper insight into the hidden mysteries of plant-life than many a man\r\nin our day, whose special business it is to watch, nurse, and care for\r\nthese humble forms of existence.\r\n\r\nBradley, about a century later, in 1718, is believed to have been the\r\nfirst author who speaks of the accomplishment of cross-breeding, which\r\nhe describes as having been effected by bringing together the branches\r\nof different trees when in blossom. But the gardeners of Holland and\r\nthe Netherlands were the first to put it into practice.[8]\r\n\r\nThe following extract is given to explain the manner in which Mr.\r\nKnight conducted his celebrated experiments on fruits, which rewarded\r\nhim with some varieties that were highly esteemed:--\"Many varieties of\r\nthe apple were collected which had been proved to afford, in mixtures\r\nwith each other, the finest cider. A tree of each was then obtained by\r\ngrafting upon a Paradise stock, and these trees were trained to a\r\nsouth wall, or if grafted on Siberian crab, to a west wall, till they\r\nafforded blossoms, and the soil in which they were planted was made of\r\nthe most rich and favorable kind. Each blossom of this species of\r\nfruit contains about twenty chives or males (stamens,) and generally\r\nfive pointals or females (pistils,) which spring from the center of\r\nthe cup or cavity of the blossom. The males stand in a circle just\r\nwithin the bases of the petals, and are formed of slender threads,\r\neach of which terminates in an anther. It is necessary in these\r\nexperiments that both the fruit and seed should attain as large a size\r\nand as much perfection as possible, and therefore a few blossoms only\r\nwere suffered to remain on each tree. As soon as the blossoms were\r\nnearly full-grown, every male in each was carefully extracted, proper\r\ncare being taken not to injure the pointals; and the blossoms, thus\r\nprepared, were closed again, and suffered to remain till they opened\r\nspontaneously. The blossoms of the tree which it was proposed to make\r\nthe male parent of the future variety, were accelerated by being\r\nbrought into contact with the wall, or retarded by being detached from\r\nit, so that they were made to unfold at the required period; and a\r\nportion of their pollen, when ready to fall from the mature anthers,\r\nwas during three or four successive mornings deposited upon the\r\npointals of the blossoms, which consequently afforded seeds. It is\r\nnecessary in this experiment that one variety of apple only should\r\nbear unmutilated blossoms; for, where other varieties are in flower at\r\nthe same time, the pollen of these will often be conveyed by bees to\r\nthe prepared blossoms, and the result of the experiment will in\r\nconsequence be uncertain and unsatisfactory.\" * * *\r\n\r\nIn his Pomona Herefordiensis, he says:--\"It is necessary to contrive\r\nthat the two trees from which you intend to raise the new kind, shall\r\nblossom at the same time; therefore, if one is an earlier sort than\r\nthe other, it must be retarded by shading or brought into a cooler\r\nsituation, and the latest forwarded by a warm wall or a sunny\r\nposition, so as to procure the desired result.\"\r\n\r\nWe must distinguish between hybrids proper and crosses, as it were\r\nbetween races or between what may have been erroneously designated\r\nspecies, for there has been a great deal of looseness in the manner of\r\nusing these terms by some writers. A true _hybrid_[9] is produced only\r\nwhen the pollen of one species has been used to fertilize the ovules\r\nof another, and as a general rule these can only be produced between\r\nplants which are very nearly allied, as between species of the same\r\ngenus. Even such as these, however, cannot always be hybridized, for\r\nwe have never found a mule or hybrid between the apple and pear, the\r\ncurrant and gooseberry, nor between the raspberry and blackberry,\r\nthough each of these, respectively, appear to be very nearly related,\r\nand they are all of the order _Rosaceæ_.\r\n\r\nIn hybrids there appears to be a mixture of the elements of each, and\r\nthe characters of the mule or cross will depend upon one or the other,\r\nwhich it will more nearly resemble. True hybrids are mules or\r\ninfertile, and cannot be continued by seed, but must be propagated by\r\ncuttings, or layers, or grafting. If not absolutely sterile at first,\r\nthey become so in the course of the second or third generation. This\r\nis proved by several of our flowering plants that have been\r\nwonderfully varied by ingenious crossing of different species. But it\r\nhas been found that the hybrid may be fertilized by pollen taken from\r\none of its parents, and that then the offspring assumes the characters\r\nof that parent.[10]\r\n\r\nNatural hybrids do not often occur, though in dioecious plants, this\r\nseems to have been the case with willows that present such an\r\nintricate puzzle to botanists in their classification, so that it has\r\nbecome almost impossible to say what are the limits and bounds of some\r\nof the species. Hybrids are, however, very frequently produced by art,\r\nand particularly among our flowering plants, under the hands of\r\ningenious gardeners. Herbert thinks, from his observations, \"that the\r\nflowers and organs of reproduction partake of the characters of the\r\nfemale parent, while the foliage and habit, or the organs of\r\nvegetation, resemble the male.\"\r\n\r\nSimply crossing different members of the same species, like the\r\ncrossing of races in animal life, is not always easily accomplished;\r\nbut we here find much less difficulty, and we do not produce a mule\r\nprogeny. In these experiments the same precautions must be taken to\r\navoid the interference of natural agents in the transportation of\r\npollen from flower to flower; but this process is now so familiar to\r\nhorticulturists, that it scarcely needs a mention. In our efforts with\r\nthe strawberry, some very curious results have occurred, and we have\r\nlearned that some of the recognized species appear under this severe\r\ntest to be well founded, as the results have been infertile. Where the\r\nperfection of the fruit depends upon the development of the seed, this\r\nis a very important matter to the fruit-grower; but fortunately this\r\nis not always the case, for certain fruits swell and ripen perfectly,\r\nthough containing not a single well developed seed. It would be an\r\ninteresting study to trace out those plants which do furnish a well\r\ndeveloped fleshy substance or sarcocarp, without the true seeds. Such\r\nmay be found occasionally in the native persimmon, in certain grapes,\r\nand in many apples; but in the strawberry, blackberry, and raspberry,\r\nthe berry which constitutes our desirable fruit, never swells unless\r\nthe germs have been impregnated and the seeds perfect. In the\r\nstone-fruits the stone or pit is always developed, but the enclosed\r\nseed is often imperfect from want of impregnation or other cause--and\r\nyet the fleshy covering will sometimes swell and ripen.\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful experimenters in this country is Doctor\r\nJ.P. Kirtland, near Cleveland, Ohio, whose efforts at crossing certain\r\nfavorite cherries, were crowned with the most happy results, and all\r\nare familiar with the fruits that have been derived from his crosses.\r\nThe details of his applying the pollen of one flower to the pistils of\r\nanother are familiar to all intelligent readers, and have been so\r\noften set forth, that they need not be repeated in this case--great\r\ncare is necessary to secure the desired object, and to guard against\r\ninterference from causes that would endanger or impair the value of\r\nthe results.\r\n\r\nVan Mons' theory was based upon certain assumptions and observations,\r\nsome of which are well founded, others are not so firmly established.\r\nHe claimed correctly that all our best fruits were artificial\r\nproducts, because the essential elements for the preservation of the\r\nspecies in their natural condition, are vigor of the plant and perfect\r\nseeds for the perpetuation of the race. It has been the object of\r\nculture to diminish the extreme vigor of the tree so as to produce\r\nearly fruitage, and at the same time to enlarge and to refine the\r\npulpy portion of the fruit. He claimed, as a principle, that our\r\nplants of culture had always a tendency to run back toward the\r\noriginal or wild type, when they were grown from seeds. This tendency\r\nis admitted to exist in many cases, but it is also claimed, that when\r\na break is once made from the normal type, the tendency to improve may\r\nbe established. Van Mons asserted that the seeds from old trees would\r\nbe still more apt to run back toward the original type, and that \"the\r\nolder the tree, the nearer will the seedlings raised from it approach\r\nthe wild state,\" though he says they will not quite reach it. But the\r\nseeds from a young tree, having itself the tendency to melioration,\r\nare more likely to produce improved sorts.\r\n\r\nHe thinks there is a limit to perfection, and that, when this is\r\nreached, the next generation will more probably produce bad fruit than\r\nthose grown from an inferior sort, which is on the upward road of\r\nprogression. He claims that the seeds of the oldest varieties of good\r\nfruit yield inferior kinds, whereas those taken from new varieties of\r\nbad fruit, and reproduced for several generations, will certainly give\r\nsatisfactory results in good fruit.\r\n\r\nHe began with seeds from a young seedling tree, not grafted upon\r\nanother stock; he cared nothing for the quality of the fruit, but\r\npreferred that the variety was showing a tendency to improvement or\r\n_variation_. These were sowed, and from the plants produced, he\r\nselected such as appeared to him to have evidence of improvement, (it\r\nis supposed by their less wild appearance), and transplanted them to\r\nstations where they could develop themselves. When they fruited, even\r\nif indifferent, if they continued to give evidence of variation, the\r\nfirst seeds were saved and planted and treated in the same way. These\r\ncame earlier into fruit than the first, and showed a greater promise.\r\nSuccessive generations were thus produced to the fourth and fifth,\r\neach came into bearing earlier than its predecessor, and produced a\r\ngreater number of good varieties, and he says that in the fifth\r\ngeneration they were nearly all of great excellence. He found pears\r\nrequired the longest time, five generations; while the apple was\r\nperfected in four, and stone fruits in three.\r\n\r\nStarting upon the theory that we must subdue the vigor of the wilding\r\nto produce the best fruits, he cut off the tap roots when\r\ntransplanting and shortened the leaders, and crowded the plants in the\r\norchard or fruiting grounds, so as to stand but a few feet apart. He\r\nurged the \"regenerating in a direct line of descent as rapidly as\r\npossible an improving variety, taking care that there be no interval\r\nbetween the generations. To sow, re-sow, to sow again, to sow\r\nperpetually, in short to do nothing but sow, is the practice to be\r\npursued, and which cannot be departed from; and, in short, this is the\r\nwhole secret of the art I have employed.\" (_Arbres Fruitiers._)\r\n\r\nWho else would have the needed patience and perseverance to pursue\r\nsuch a course? Very few, indeed--especially if they were not very\r\nfully convinced of the correctness of the premises upon which this\r\ntheory is founded. Mr. Downing thinks that the great numbers of fine\r\nvarieties of apples that have been produced in this country, go to\r\nsustain the Van Mons doctrine, because, as he assumes, the first\r\napples that were produced from seeds brought over by the early\r\nemigrants, yielded inferior fruit which had run back toward the wild\r\nstate, and the people were forced to begin again with them, and that\r\nthey most naturally pursued this very plan, taking seeds from the\r\nimproving varieties for the next generations and so on. This may have\r\nbeen so, but it is mere assumption--we have no proof, and, on the\r\ncontrary, our choice varieties have so generally been conceded to have\r\nbeen chance seedlings, that there appears little evidence to support\r\nit--on the contrary, some very fine varieties have been produced by\r\nselecting the seeds of good sorts promiscuously, and without regarding\r\nthe age of the trees from which the fruit was taken. Mr. Downing\r\nhimself, after telling us that we have much encouragement to\r\nexperiment upon this plan of perfecting fruits, by taking seeds from\r\nsuch as are not quite ripe, gathered from a seedling of promising\r\nquality, from a healthy young tree (quite young,) on its own root, not\r\ngrafted, and that we \"must avoid 1st, the seeds of old trees; 2d,\r\nthose of grafted trees; 3d, that we must have the best grounds for\r\ngood results\"--still admits what we all know, that \"in this country,\r\nnew varieties of rare excellence are sometimes obtained at once by\r\nplanting the seeds of old grafted varieties; thus the Lawrence\r\nFavorite and the Columbia Plums were raised from seeds of the Green\r\nGage, one of the oldest European varieties.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now look at an absolute experiment conducted avowedly upon the\r\nVan Mons plan in our own country, upon the fertile soil of the State\r\nof Illinois, and see to what results it led:--\r\n\r\nThe following facts have been elicited from correspondence with H.P.\r\nBrayshaw, of Du Quoin, Illinois. The experiments were instituted by\r\nhis father many years ago, to test the truth of the Van Mons' theory\r\nof the improvement of fruits by using only the first seeds.\r\n\r\nThirty-five years ago, in 1827, his father procured twenty-five\r\nseedling trees from a nursery, which may be supposed to have been an\r\naverage lot, grown from promiscuous seed. These were planted, and when\r\nthey came into bearing, six of them furnished fruit that might be\r\ncalled \"_good_\" and of these, \"four were considered _fine_.\" One of\r\nthe six is still in cultivation, and known as the _Illinois Greening_.\r\nOf the remainder of the trees, some of the fruits were fair, and the\r\nrest were worthless, and have disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Second Generation._--The first fruits of these trees were selected,\r\nand the seeds were sown. Of the resulting crop, some furnished fruit\r\nthat was \"good,\" but they do not appear to have merited much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n_Third Generation._--From first seeds of the above, one hundred trees\r\nwere produced, some of which were good fruit, and some \"even fine,\"\r\nwhile some were very poor, \"four or five only merited attention.\" So\r\nthat we see a retrogression from the random seedlings, furnishing\r\ntwenty-five per cent, of good fruit, to only four or five per cent. in\r\nthe third generation, that were worthy of note.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Generation._--A crop of the first seed was again sown,\r\nproducing a fourth generation; of these many were \"good culinary\r\nfruits,\" none, or very few being of the \"poorest class of seedlings,\"\r\nnone of them, however, were fine enough \"for the dessert.\"\r\n\r\n_Fifth Generation._--This crop of seedlings was destroyed by the\r\ncut-worms, so that only one tree now remains, but has not yet fruited.\r\nBut Mr. Brayshaw appears to feel hopeful of the results, and promises\r\nto continue the experiment.\r\n\r\nCrops have also been sown from some of these trees, but a smaller\r\nproportion of the seedlings thus produced were good fruits, than when\r\nthe first seeds were used--this Mr. Brayshaw considers confirmatory\r\nevidence of the theory, though he appears to feel confidence in the\r\nvarieties already in use, most of which had almost an accidental\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nHe thinks the result would have been more successful had the blossoms\r\nbeen protected from impregnation by other trees, and recommends that\r\nthose to be experimented with should be planted at a distance from\r\norchards, so as to avoid this cross-breeding, and to allow of what is\r\ncalled breeding in-and-in. If this were done, he feels confident that\r\n\"the seedlings would more nearly resemble the parent, and to a certain\r\nextent would manifest the tendency to improvement, and that from the\r\nearliest ripened fruits, some earlier varieties would be produced,\r\nfrom those latest ripening, later varieties, from those that were\r\ninferior and insipid, poor sorts would spring, and that from the very\r\nbest and most perfect fruits we might expect one in one thousand, or\r\none-tenth of one per cent., to be better than the parent.\" This\r\ndiminishes the chance for improvement to a beautifully fine point upon\r\nwhich to hang our hopes of the result of many generations of seedlings\r\noccupying more than a lifetime of experiments.\r\n\r\nMr. Brayshaw, citing some of the generally adopted axioms of breeders\r\nof animals, assumes that _crosses_, as of distinct races, will not be\r\nso likely to produce good results, as a system of breeding in-and-in,\r\npersistently carried out. This plan he recommends, and alludes to the\r\nquince and mulberry as suitable species to operate upon, because in\r\nthem there are fewer varieties, and therefore less liability to\r\ncross-breeding, and a better opportunity for breeding in-and-in. He\r\nalso reminds us of the happy results which follow the careful\r\nselection of the best specimens in garden flowers and vegetables,\r\ncombined with the rejection of all inferior plants, when we desire to\r\nimprove the character of our garden products, and he adopts the views\r\nof certain physiologists, which, however, are questioned by other\r\nauthorities, to the effect that violent or decided crosses are always\r\nfollowed by depreciation and deterioration of the offspring.\r\n\r\nThe whole communication referring to these experiments, which are\r\nalmost the only ones, so far as I know, which have been conducted in\r\nthis country to any extent, to verify or controvert the Van Mons'\r\ntheory, is very interesting, but it is easy to perceive that the\r\nexperimenter, though apparently very fair, and entirely honest, has\r\nbeen fully imbued with the truth and correctness of the proposition of\r\nVan Mons, that the first ripened seed of a natural plant was more\r\nlikely to produce an improved variety, and that this tendency to\r\nimprovement would ever increase, and be most prominent in the first\r\nripened seeds of successive generations grown from it.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Van Mons I shall not attempt in this place to\r\ncontrovert, but will simply say that nothing which has yet come under\r\nmy observation has had a tendency to make me a convert to the avowed\r\nviews of that great Belgian Pomologist, while, on the contrary, the\r\nrumors of his opponents, that he was really attempting to produce\r\ncrosses from some of the best fruits, as our gardeners have most\r\nsuccessfully done in numerous instances, in the beautiful flowers and\r\ndelicious vegetables of modern horticulture, have always impressed me\r\nwith a color of probability, and if he were not actually and\r\nintentionally impregnating the blossoms with pollen of the better\r\nvarieties, natural causes, such as the moving currents of air, and the\r\never active insects, whose special function in many instances appears\r\nto be the conveyance of pollen, would necessarily cause an admixture,\r\nwhich, in a promiscuous and crowded collection, like the \"school of\r\nVan Mons,\" would at least have an equal chance of producing an\r\nimprovement in some of the resulting seeds.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of variation in species, the existence of varieties,\r\nand also of those partial _sports_, which may perhaps be considered as\r\nstill more temporary variations from the originals, than those which\r\ncome through the seeds, is one of deep interest, well worthy of our\r\nstudy, but concerning which we must confess ourselves as yet quite\r\nignorant, and our best botanists do not agree even as to the\r\n_specific_ distinctions that have been set up as characters of some of\r\nour familiar plants, for the most eminent differ with regard to the\r\nspecies of some of our common trees and plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNNING OUT OF VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nIt has been a very generally received opinion among intelligent\r\nfruit-growers, that any given variety of fruit can have but a limited\r\nperiod of existence, be that longer or shorter. Reasoning from the\r\nanalogies of animal life this would appear very probable, for it is\r\nwell known that individuals of different species all have a definite\r\nperiod of life, some quite brief, others quite extended, beyond which\r\nthey do not survive. But with our modern views of vegetation, though\r\nwe know that all perennial plants do eventually die and molder away to\r\nthe dust from whence they were created, and that many trees of our own\r\nplanting come to an untimely end, while we yet survive to observe\r\ntheir decay, still, we can see no reason why a tree or parts of a tree\r\ntaken from it, and placed under circumstances favorable to its growth\r\nfrom time to time, may not be sempiternal. Harvey has placed this\r\nmatter in a correct light, by showing that the true life and history\r\nof a tree is in the buds, which are annual, while the tree itself is\r\nthe connecting link between them and the ground. Any portion of such a\r\ncompound existence, grafted upon another stock, or planted immediately\r\nin the ground itself and established upon its own roots, will produce\r\na new tree like the first, being furnished with supplies of\r\nnourishment it may grow indefinitely while retaining all the qualities\r\nof the parent stock--if that be healthy and vigorous so will\r\nthis--indeed new life and vigor often seem to be imparted by a\r\ncongenial thrifty stock, and a fertile soil, so that there does not\r\nappear to be any reason why the variety should ever run out and\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished Thomas Andrew Knight, President of the London\r\nHorticultural Society, was one of the leading advocates of the theory\r\nthat varieties would necessarily run out and disappear as it were by\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nIn his Pomona Herefordiensis, he tells us that \"those apples, which\r\nhave been long in cultivation, are on the decay. The Redstreak and\r\nGolden Pippin can no longer be propagated with advantage. The fruit,\r\nlike the parent tree, is affected by the debilitated old age of the\r\nvariety.\" And in his treatise on the culture of the apple and pear, he\r\nsays: \"The Moil and its successful rival, the Redstreak, with the Must\r\nand Golden Pippin, are in the last stage of decay, and the Stire and\r\nFoxwhelp are hastening rapidly after them.\" In noticing the decay of\r\napple trees, Pliny probably refers to particular trees, rather than\r\nthe whole of any variety, when he says that \"apples become old sooner\r\nthan any other tree, and the fruit becomes smaller and is subject to\r\nbe cankered and worm-eaten, even while on the trees.\"--Lib. XVI, Chap.\r\n27.\r\n\r\nSpeechly combated the views of Mr. Knight, and says: \"It is much to be\r\nregretted that this apparently visionary notion of the extinction of\r\ncertain kinds of apples should have been promulgated by authors of\r\nrespectability, since the mistake will, for a time at least, be\r\nproductive of several ill consequences.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the old English varieties that were supposed to be worn out or\r\nexhausted, appear to have taken a new lease of life in this country,\r\nbut we have not yet had a long enough experience to decide this\r\nquestion. Many of the earlier native favorites of the orchard have,\r\nfor some reason, disappeared from cultivation--whether they have run\r\nout, were originally deficient in vigor, or have merely been\r\nsuperseded by more acceptable varieties, does not appear.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips, in his Companion, states \"that in 1819, he observed a\r\ngreat quantity of the Golden Pippin in Covent Garden Market, which\r\nwere in perfect condition, and was induced to make inquiries\r\nrespecting the health of the variety, which resulted in satisfactory\r\nreplies from all quarters, that the trees were recovering from\r\ndisease, which he thought had been induced by a succession of\r\nunpropitious seasons. He cites Mr. Ronald's opinion, that there was\r\nthen no fear of losing this variety; and Mr. Lee, who thought that the\r\napparent decay of some trees was owing to unfavorable seasons. Mr.\r\nHarrison informed him that this variety was very successfully grown on\r\nthe mountains of the island of Madeira, at an elevation of 3000 feet,\r\nand produced abundantly. Also that the variety was quite satisfactory\r\nin many parts of England, and concludes that the Golden Pippin only\r\nrequires the most genial situation, to render it as prolific is\r\nformerly.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite probable, as Phillips suggests, that Mr. Knight had\r\nwatched the trees during unfavorable seasons which prevailed at that\r\nperiod, and as he found the disease increase, he referred it to the\r\nold age of the variety, and based his theory to that effect upon\r\npartial data.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight's views, though they have taken a strong hold upon the\r\npopular mind, have not been confirmed by physiologists. For though the\r\nseed would appear to be the proper source whence to derive our new\r\nplants, and certainly our new varieties of fruits, many plants have,\r\nfor an indefinite period, been propagated by layers, shoots or scions,\r\nbuds, tubers, etc., and that the variety has thus been extended much\r\nbeyond the period of the life of the parent or original seedling.\r\nStrawberries are propagated and multiplied by the runners, potatoes by\r\ntubers, the Tiger Lily by bulblets, some onions by proliferous bulbs,\r\nsugarcane by planting pieces of the stalk, many grapes by horizontal\r\nstems, and many plants by cuttings, for a very great length of time.\r\nThe grape vine has been continued in this way from the days of the\r\nRomans. A slip taken from a willow in Mr. Knight's garden pronounced\r\nby him to be dying from old age, was planted in the Edinburgh Botanic\r\nGarden many years ago, and is now a vigorous tree, though the original\r\nstock has long since gone to decay.[11]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] North American Sylva, Nuttall II, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[4] Diary.\r\n\r\n[5] History of Knaresborough, p. 216.--Companion of the Orchard, p. 34.\r\n\r\n[6] Our lexicographers give it a similar origin, but refer it to the\r\nshape in which it was put up.

PACKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll propagation of plants must depend upon the development of seeds or\r\nof buds, and all will arise from the growth and extension of cells.\r\nThe seed and the bud are much more nearly related than a casual\r\nobserver would at first sight suppose. The early phylologists thought\r\nthey discovered that in the seed was enwrapped the image of the future\r\ntree--a dissection of the seed would appear to demonstrate this. It is\r\ncomposed of separate parts which are capable of being developed into\r\nthe root, stem, and appendages, but they have yet to be so developed;\r\nthe several parts that we find in the seed are merely the\r\nrepresentative parts. But the seed has the future of the tree within\r\nitself, it has certain qualities of the future tree impressed upon it\r\nin its primary organization, within the capsule of the fruit of the\r\nparent plant, so that in a higher sense the image of the future tree\r\ndoes exist within the seed. Within the bud, still more plainly and\r\nmore distinctly visible, is the future tree manifest, and we may\r\nproduce a tree from a bud as certainly as we do from a seed. Subjected\r\nto circumstances favorable for growth, the bud, as well as the seed,\r\nwill emit roots, will form its stem, branches and appendages, and will\r\nbecome a tree; differing from the product of the seed only in this,\r\nthat in the latter the resulting organism constitutes a new individual\r\nwhich may vary somewhat from its parent, in the former it is only a\r\nnew development of a part of a previously existing organization. The\r\nsimilarity existing between the two is exceedingly close, and is a\r\nmatter of great importance in horticultural operations. Dr. Lindley,\r\nin the Gardener's Chronicle, says very truly, that \"every bud of a\r\ntree is an individual vegetable, and a tree, therefore, is a family or\r\nswarm of individual plants, like the polype with its young growing out\r\nof its sides, or like the branching cells of the coral insect.\"\r\nSimilar opinions, more or less modified, have been expressed by\r\nsubsequent physiologists, and are familiar to men of science in every\r\ncountry and, we may add, are also universally accepted as true by all\r\nwho claim a right to express an opinion upon the subject.--Men of\r\nscience recognize the individuality of buds.--Nobody doubts the\r\nindividuality of buds.--In a gardening aspect, the individuality of\r\nbuds is the cardinal point upon which some of our most important\r\noperations turn; such, for example, as all modes of propagation\r\nwhatever, except by seed. If this be not fully understood, there is no\r\npossible explanation of the reasons why certain results are sure to\r\nfollow the attachment of a bud, or the insertion of a graft, or the\r\nplanting of a cutting, or the bending of a layer, or the approach of a\r\nscion, or the setting of an eye--our six great forms of artificial\r\nmultiplication. In his Elements of Botany, the same writer says: \"An\r\nembryo is a young plant produced by the agency of the sexes, and\r\ndeveloped within a seed--a leaf bud is a young plant, produced without\r\nthe agency of the sexes, enclosed within the rudimentary leaves called\r\nscales, and developed on a stem.\" \"An embryo propagates the _species_,\r\nleaf-buds propagate the _individual_.\" He shows each to be \"a young\r\nplant developing itself upwards, downwards and horizontally, into\r\nstem, root, and medullary system.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Schleiden thus beautifully expresses his views of their\r\nindividuality: \"Now the bud essentially is nothing more than a\r\nrepetition of the plant on which it is formed. The foundation of a new\r\nplant consists equally of a stem and leaves, and the sole distinction\r\nis that the stem becomes intimately blended at its base with the\r\nmother plant in its growth, and has no free radical extremity like\r\nthat exhibited by a plant developed from a seed. However, this\r\ndistinction is not so great as at the first glance it appears. Every\r\nplant of high organization possesses the power of shooting out\r\nadventitious roots from its stem, under the favoring influences of\r\nmoisture; and very frequently, even plants that have been raised from\r\nseed, are forced to content themselves with such adventitious roots,\r\nsince it is the nature of many plants, for instance the grasses, never\r\nto develop their proper root, although the radicle is actually\r\npresent. We are, it is true, accustomed to look upon the matter as\r\nthough the buds must always be developed into twigs and branches, on\r\nand in connection with the plant itself; and thus in common life, we\r\nregard them as parts of a plant, and not as independent individuals,\r\nwhich they are in fact, although they, like children who remain in\r\ntheir paternal home, retain the closest connection with the plant on\r\nwhich they were produced. That they are at least capable of becoming\r\nindependent plants, is shown by an experiment frequently successful\r\nwhen the necessary care is taken, namely the breaking off and sowing\r\nof the buds of our forest trees. The well-known garden operations of\r\ngrafting and budding are also examples of this, and layering only\r\ndiffers from the sowing of the buds, in that the buds on the layers\r\nare allowed to acquire a certain degree of maturity before they are\r\nseparated from the parent plant. All here depends upon the facility\r\nwith which these bud plants root as it is called, that is develop\r\nadventitious roots, when they are brought in contact with moist earth.\r\n* * * Nature herself very often makes use of this method to multiply\r\ncertain plants in incalculable numbers. In a few cases, the process\r\nresembles the artificial sowing of buds, as when the plant\r\nspontaneously throws off the perfect buds at a certain period; an\r\ninstance of this is afforded by some of our garden Lilies, which throw\r\noff the little bulb-like buds which appear in the axils of the lower\r\nleaves. The more common mode of proceeding is as follows: Those buds\r\nwhich have been formed near the surface of the soil, grow up into\r\nshoots provided with leaves; but the shoots are long, slender and\r\ndelicate, the leaves too are stunted into little scales; in their\r\naxils, however, they develop strong buds, which either in the same or\r\nin the following year take root, and the slender shoot connecting them\r\nwith the parent plant, dying and decaying, they become free\r\nindependent plants. In this manner the strawberry soon covers a\r\nneglected garden.\"[12]\r\n\r\nUpon the development of a cell in any living tissue, and its power of\r\nreproducing other cells, and upon its function of communicating by\r\nendosmosis and exosmosis with other like cells, depend all our success\r\nin propagating vegetables, whether from seeds or buds, and parts\r\ncontaining these. We must study the circumstances that favor the\r\ndevelopment of cells, if we would be successful in propagating plants.\r\nEach bud being considered an individual, and capable, under favorable\r\ncircumstances, of taking on a separate existence, we can multiply any\r\nindividual variety indefinitely, and be sure of having the same\r\nqualities of foliage and fruit that we admire in the original, and\r\nthat we may desire to propagate. This applies equally to a group of\r\nbuds, as in cuttings, grafts and layers, etc.; but, more wonderful\r\nstill, there are cells capable of developing buds where none existed\r\nbefore, and even in tissues or parts of a plant where we do not\r\nusually find buds--hence we have a mode of propagation of many woody\r\nplants, by root cuttings, and by leaves, and even parts of leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION BY CUTTINGS.--Many fruits are multiplied by this means.\r\nHealthy shoots of the previous year's growth are usually selected and\r\ntaken when the parent is in a dormant state, or still better, when it\r\nis approaching this condition. Sometimes a small portion of the\r\nprevious year's growth is left with the cutting, making a sort of\r\n_heel_; when this is not to be had, or not preferred, the slip is to\r\nbe prepared for planting by cutting it smoothly just below a bud, as\r\nthis seems to be the most favorable point in many plants for the\r\nemission of roots. Some plants will throw out radicles at any point\r\nindifferently along the internodes or merithallus. The preference for\r\nheel-cuttings depends upon the fact, that near the base of the annual\r\nshoot there are always a great number of buds, many of which, however,\r\nbeing imperfectly developed, are inconspicuous, but though dormant,\r\nthey seem to favor the emission of rootlets. Cuttings may be made to\r\ngrow if taken at any period of their development, but when green and\r\nsoft, they require particular conditions of heat and moisture in the\r\nsoil, and atmosphere, that are only under the control of the\r\nprofessional gardener. They are usually taken in the dormant state,\r\nbecause they are then susceptible of being made to grow under the\r\nordinary conditions of out-door gardening. If cut early in the season,\r\non the approach of autumn, after the wood-growth has been perfected,\r\nthey may be planted at once with good prospect of success, or they may\r\nbe put into the soil, out of doors, in the cellar, or in a cold frame\r\nor pit, and a very important step in the progress of their growth will\r\ncommence at once. The leafless sticks are not dead, and whenever the\r\ntemperature will admit of the quiet interchange of fluids among their\r\ncells, this curious function will go on, and will be accompanied by\r\nthe development or generation of new cells that soon cover the cut\r\nsurfaces, constituting what the gardeners call the _callus_. This is\r\nthe first step toward growth, and it most readily occurs when the\r\nearth is warmer than the air; hence the value of fall planting,\r\nwhether of trees or of cuttings, if done before the earth has been\r\nchilled, and hence also, the importance of bottom heat in artificial\r\npropagation. If on the contrary the air be warm and the ground cold,\r\nthe buds are often stimulated to burst forth, before the rootlets can\r\nhave started. The expanding foliage which so delights the tyro in\r\npropagation, offers an extended surface for evaporation, the contained\r\njuices of the cutting itself are soon exhausted, no adequate supply is\r\nfurnished, and the hopeful plant soon withers, or damps off, and\r\ndies.[13] The cutting, like the seed, must have \"first the root, then\r\nthe blade.\" The length of time that is allowed for cuttings to prepare\r\nfor rooting, if they are designed for spring planting, should be as\r\ngreat as possible, and the circumstances under which they are kept\r\nshould be such as to favor the development of the cells, so that roots\r\nmay form freely with the breaking of the buds, if not before.\r\n\r\nRoot-cuttings should be made in the spring, just before the usual\r\nperiod of the bursting of the buds in the plant to be propagated. The\r\ntendency to develop buds appears to be then most active. Gentle\r\nbottom heat, though not essential, is still very desirable, and will\r\nconduce to the success of the operation. Some plants are best\r\npropagated by this means, and those too, which never naturally produce\r\nsuckers, may often be successfully grown by sections of the roots. All\r\nplants do not equally admit of propagation by division as cuttings,\r\nsome woody tissues refusing to emit roots under almost any\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nNobody thinks of propagating the stone fruits, such as the cherry,\r\nplum, peach, or apricot, by attempting to plant cuttings, and yet some\r\nof these will emit roots very freely, as we may often observe when the\r\nshoots or trimmings are used as supports for plants in the\r\ngreen-house. The plum tree is exceedingly apt to form new roots when\r\nplanted too deeply, and upon this fact depends the success or failure\r\nof the finer varieties when worked upon certain varieties of the wild\r\nstock. If the young trees are earthed up in the nursery, and set\r\nrather deeply in the orchard, they will soon establish a good set of\r\nroots of their own, emitted above the junction of the scion and stock,\r\nwhich is very preferable to the imperfect union and consequent\r\nenlargement that often results from using uncongenial stocks. The\r\nraspberry and blackberry do not grow so well from cuttings of the\r\nwood, which is always biennial in this genus, as they do from\r\nroot-cuttings.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country, peaches are mainly produced, or the\r\nfavorite varieties are multiplied, by planting the sprouts that come\r\nfrom the base of the trunk of the trees; these have little or no roots\r\nwhen taken off with the mattock, but they soon establish themselves\r\nand make good trees, bearing fruit like their parents, in soils and\r\nclimate that are well adapted to this fruit.\r\n\r\nRefined and scientific horticulture has been extensively applied to\r\nthe multiplication of the grape, which is now produced in immense\r\nnumbers, from single eyes, or buds. Formerly our vineyards were formed\r\nby planting long cuttings at once in the field in the stations to be\r\noccupied by the vines, or by setting them first in a nursery, whence\r\nthey were transplanted to the vineyard, when one or two years old.\r\nOnly the most refractory kinds, which would not grow readily in the\r\nfield, or such as were yet rare, were propagated from cuttings, by\r\nusing the single eye and artificial bottom heat. Now, however, the\r\nappliances of our propagators are called upon for the production of\r\ngrape-vines by the million, and they find it advisable to multiply all\r\nthe varieties in this manner. The propagation of the grape by using\r\nsingle eyes affords the most beautiful illustration of the subject of\r\nthe individuality of buds, and though denounced by some as an\r\nunnatural, steam-forcing process, it is really an evidence of the\r\nadvance of horticulture, since every step is supported by a\r\nphilosophical reason, and the whole process, to be successful, is\r\ndependent upon the application to practice of well established\r\nscientific truths.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--FRENCH AND COMMON MODES OF SETTING\r\n    CUTTINGS.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the first effect of cell-growth upon a\r\ncutting, is the production of a callus. This callus may form upon any\r\ncut surface, or even where the bark has been abraded. It is the first\r\neffort of nature to repair an injury by the reproduction of new parts;\r\nit is most generally found at the base of the cutting, but under\r\nfavorable circumstances, it will be seen also at the upper end of the\r\nshoot if this has been placed in contact with the earth. Cuttings will\r\nsometimes be set up-side down, when we find the callus upon the\r\nsmaller end, and roots will be emitted from that portion whence we\r\nshould have expected to see the branches issue. Upon this fact, and to\r\nmultiply the chances of living, has been based the French method, as\r\nit is called, or that of inserting both ends of the cuttings. The\r\ncommon mode, (fig. 1), is to set the cuttings in a slanting direction\r\nin the ground, so placed that the upper eye or bud only shall reach\r\nthe surface. Formerly there was a preference for long cuttings, and\r\nthese were often made eighteen inches or more in length. The practice\r\nwith most of our cultivators has been modified in this particular, and\r\nthey have reduced the length of the slips to six and eight inches, so\r\nas to have in grape wood about three or four eyes. Some have gone\r\nstill further, and use but two, even for out-door planting of the\r\ngrape, and some have been very successful when using but a single\r\njoint. The Germans have advocated longer cuttings, upon the theory\r\nthat there was a retroaction in the pith of the internodes and in all\r\nthe buds of the cutting, upon the lower point, enabling it to push\r\nroots more strongly from a long than from a short cutting. This\r\ntheory has for its support the fact, that there is in such a cutting a\r\nlarger amount of organizable matter to be developed into the new parts\r\nto be produced, and certainly, if neglected, short cuttings will be\r\nvery apt to suffer from drought, but in practice, it is found that the\r\nshort cutting plants have better roots, which are near the surface,\r\nand even those plants, grown from single eyes, are better burnished\r\nthan long cuttings produced upon the old plan, which placed the roots\r\ndeep in the soil.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--ONE-EYE CUTTINGS OF THE GRAPE.]\r\n\r\nThere are various methods of preparing the single-eye cuttings, some\r\nof which are represented in fig. 2.\r\n\r\nAmong our cultivated fruits there is but a limited number that need to\r\nbe propagated by cuttings, though, where it becomes necessary, many of\r\nthem may be grown in this manner, to which procedure there are no\r\nserious objections, though there are some of a theoretical nature. The\r\ncurrant and the gooseberry are increased almost exclusively from\r\ncuttings, they strike root very readily, and are multiplied to any\r\nextent; their seeds are sown only to produce new varieties. The grape\r\nis propagated very extensively by cuttings; the slips are often\r\nplanted in the field and in the stations where the vines are wanted\r\nfor the vineyard; but some varieties are so unsatisfactory in their\r\nresults, that other more elaborate and scientific means must be taken\r\nfor their propagation. Among the larger fruits, those constituting our\r\ntrees, we do not depend upon cuttings, except in the quince, which is\r\nnot only grown for its fruit, but is also largely produced as a stock\r\nfor the dwarfed pear, and is extensively propagated from cuttings. The\r\nParadise apple, a dwarf stock, is multiplied in the same way. Pears\r\nand apples may be grown from cuttings, but this plan is not pursued\r\nwith them to any extent. Those that are root-grafted, or budded very\r\nlow, especially the pear on quince stocks, will often produce roots if\r\nfavorably situated, but there is a great difference in varieties, some\r\nrarely produce a root, while others are very prone to do it; from\r\nobservations of this fact, a new phase of dwarf-pear culture has been\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCKERS.--One of the simplest methods of multiplying varieties\r\nconsists of increasing and encouraging the suckers thrown up by the\r\nroots; these are separated and set out for trees. We have been told by\r\nsome physiologists that there was an absolute difference in structure\r\nbetween the root and the stem, that they could not be substituted the\r\none for the other; and yet the oft quoted marvel of the tree which was\r\nplanted upside down, and which produced flowers and leaves from its\r\nroots, while its branches emitted fibres, and became true roots, is\r\nfamiliar to every one. Here, as in other cases, our teachers have led\r\nus into error by attempting to trace analogy with animal anatomy and\r\nphysiology, and by directing our attention to the circulation of\r\nplants, as though they, like the higher animals, possessed true\r\narterial and venous currents of circulating fluids. The cell\r\ncirculation is quite a different affair, and can be conducted in\r\neither direction, as every gardener knows who has ever layered a\r\nplant, or set a cutting upside down. So with the roots--they are but\r\ndownward extensions of the stem; under ordinary circumstances they\r\nhave no need for buds, but these may be, and often are developed, when\r\nthe necessity for their presence arises. Buds do exist on roots,\r\nespecially upon those that are horizontal and near the surface, and\r\nfrom them freely spring suckers, which are as much parts of the parent\r\ntree as its branches, and may be planted with entire certainty of\r\nobtaining the same fruit, just as the twigs when used as cuttings, or\r\nscions, when grafted, will produce similar results.\r\n\r\nWhole orchards are planted, in some sections of the country, with the\r\nsuckers from old trees; apples, pears, plums, and even peaches, as\r\nwell as raspberries and blackberries, are multiplied in this primitive\r\nway. There are some varieties of apples that have been so propagated\r\nfor half a century, and extended for hundreds of miles in this way by\r\nthe pioneer emigrants, without ever having been grafted, until their\r\nmerits have at length accidentally become known to the Pomological\r\nSocieties and nurserymen, when the propagation of them by grafting\r\nsoon supercedes the more primitive method. Sucker trees are objected\r\nto upon the grounds that they are not healthy and thrifty, that they\r\ndo not have good roots. Inherent disease of the parent tree will of\r\ncourse be transmitted with its other peculiarities, but I cannot\r\nimagine that this would be any more likely to occur in a sucker than\r\nin a layer, or cutting, or graft. As to the roots, they may be more\r\ndeveloped upon one side than another in the young tree, and this state\r\nof things may continue in the adult; we often observe the same\r\ncondition in the stumps of the monarchs of our forests, which were\r\nnever suspected in the day of their glory and pride of having such a\r\nfault. But such a condition of roots is not essential to the sucker,\r\nwhich may be made to have as fine a system of lateral roots, and as\r\nevenly and regularly distributed as those of a seedling tree. Another\r\nobjection to this mode of propagation has much truth and some force;\r\nthat is, that suckers are very apt to produce suckers again. This is\r\nparticularly the case with the Morello cherry, which is a favorite\r\nstock, upon which to work many of the choice varieties. As an offset\r\nto this it may be urged, that the small fibrous roots, which are\r\nsupposed to conduce to early fruitfulness, abound in trees propagated\r\nby this means, and this may be the reason why the fruit trees that\r\nhave been thus multiplied, are very generally remarkable for their\r\nprecocious fruiting. Some of the apples that have been long increased\r\nin this manner, bear so early, and so bountifully, as to prevent them\r\nfrom ever forming very large trees; they often have a stunted\r\nappearance, and not infrequently present a peculiar inequality upon\r\nthe bark, portions being swollen or enlarged like warts--from which,\r\nin some cases, it is easy to force out shoots or sprouts; they are\r\nindeed true gemmules like those of the old olive trees, and like them\r\nmight be used for the propagation of the variety; a similar condition,\r\nno doubt, exists in the roots, whence the tendency to sucker. The\r\ncommon Morello cherry; the Damson; the Chickasas, and other varieties\r\nof plum; the blackberry, and many raspberries, are multiplied almost\r\nexclusively in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYERS are portions of the branches of a plant that have been induced\r\nto throw out roots, and which can thus set up an independent existence\r\nif removed from the parent tree. This mode of propagation is a very\r\nnatural one, and was probably an accidental discovery. In its traits,\r\nit is the reverse of the mode we have just been considering. Here the\r\nbranch emits roots, instead of the root emitting branches, as in the\r\ncase of the sucker. Layering is frequently resorted to as a mode of\r\npropagation, it is very simple, easily performed, and, with some\r\nspecies, very certain in its results. Some plants will root readily if\r\nmerely placed in contact with the ground, or very slightly covered\r\nwith soil; others require some artificial interference, such as\r\nringing, or twisting, or slitting. The raspberry, known as the _Rubus\r\noccidentalis_ or Black-cap, belongs to the first class, and it even\r\nplaces itself in contact with the soil by recurving its branches so as\r\nto bring the tips to the earth, where they strike root, and make new\r\nplants. The grape comes under the second category, needing only a\r\nlittle assistance, and it is multiplied to a considerable extent in\r\nthis manner. In the spring, the vines are laid out in a little shallow\r\ntrench, and pegged down closely; as the buds burst, they throw up\r\nshoots which are trained vertically by tying them to sticks, and as\r\nsoon as these shoots have acquired a certain degree of maturity and\r\nfirmness, the mellow earth is drawn up to them and they emit a\r\nbeautiful system of roots, and by the fall they form very fine plants,\r\n(fig. 3). The layered branch is then taken up and the several plants\r\nare separated, when it will be found that the best roots are chiefly\r\nfrom the lower joints of the new wood, rather than from the old canes\r\nthat were laid down in the spring.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--PROPAGATING THE GRAPE BY LAYERING.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--LAYERING THE QUINCE.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--STOOL LAYERING THE QUINCE.]\r\n\r\nQuinces are considerably increased by a sort of layering, as the twigs\r\nemit roots very freely; they are often bent down, slightly twisted, or\r\nnot, as the case may be, and covered with mellow soil, when they\r\nreadily emit roots, become firmly established, and may be set out by\r\nthemselves, (fig. 4). There is, however, another method of layering,\r\nmuch practiced in the multiplication of the quince; that called\r\npropagation by stools. The plants are set in open rows, four feet\r\nwide, and three or four feet apart in the rows; they should be so\r\nplanted as to stand below the general surface, that is in trenches.\r\nWhen cut off at the ground in the spring, they throw up a great number\r\nof shoots, and the earth is gradually worked up to these to encourage\r\ntheir rooting, (see figure 5), which is often sufficient for removal\r\nthe first season; if, on inspection, the roots are not found to be\r\nsufficiently large or abundant, the earthing is continued until the\r\nautumn of the next year, when they are removed, the stools trimmed of\r\ntheir lower roots, and reset in new trenches. The plants, thus raised\r\nfrom stools, are cut back severely, and are then ready to set out in\r\nnursery rows for budding. With the quince, cultivated in this manner,\r\nnothing is required but to accumulate the mellow earth about the\r\nshoots; but in many plants it is necessary to notch the wood by\r\nsplitting, or cutting it for an inch or two, (as in fig. 6), making a\r\ntongue that separates from the lower portion of the shoot, and from\r\nwhich the roots are emitted. This slit should be commenced just below\r\na bud, and the knife is drawn upward, cutting halfway through the\r\nwood. If commenced at one side instead of at the depending portion,\r\nthe tongue is more sure to be separated from the stock, to which it\r\nmight otherwise reunite. To insure rooting, some persons insert a\r\nlittle stick or chip between the separated portions, to prevent a\r\nre-union of the parts. The shoot, after being notched, is fastened\r\ndown, and fine soil or compost is brought about it to encourage the\r\ndevelopment of roots. Few of the hard wooded fruit trees have been\r\nextensively propagated by means of layers; they might be so produced,\r\nbut it has not been found profitable nor necessary.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--MANNER OF CUTTING AND PEGGING DOWN A\r\n    LAYER.]\r\n\r\nA very common opinion prevails that layering exhausts the mother\r\nplant, or vine, which is used in this mode of propagating. If properly\r\nconducted, there is no reason why this should be; but if the whole top\r\nof any plant is bent down and made to take root, and to form\r\nindependent roots, there can be little or no return from the branches\r\nto the original stock to strengthen it. A certain amount of healthy\r\ngrowing wood should always be left in its natural position, and no\r\ndanger to the plant need be apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe wood growth of the strawberry, when allowed to take its natural\r\nbent, is directed into the stolons or runners, which form natural\r\nlayers. Their production detracts from the central wood-growth of the\r\nplant, and exhausts its strength to such a degree, that it often dies,\r\nwhereas, by a constant removal of the runners, as fast as they appear,\r\nwe practice a sort of summer pruning or pinching, which results in the\r\nproduction of a large branching stool, with many points or centers for\r\nthe production of foliage and flowers, and thus insure the greatest\r\nabundance of fruit. The strawberry, like one species of the raspberry,\r\nand many other of our native plants, offers illustrations of natural\r\nlayering.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDS.--The most common as well as the most natural mode of\r\nmultiplying the individual plants of most of our fruit trees, is by\r\nsowing the seed; from this source we procure stocks upon which are\r\nworked, by budding or grafting, the several varieties we may desire to\r\npropagate. As an illustration of this process, I propose to speak of\r\napple seedlings.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal means of increasing the number of apple trees, is\r\nby sowing the seed. This is generally selected and separated from the\r\nfresh pomace left on the press in cider-making. The old and slow\r\nprocess of hand-washing has given way, in this age of labor-saving\r\nmachinery, to more economical methods. The most approved apparatus is\r\nconstructed upon the principle of separating the seeds from the pulp\r\nby means of their greater specific gravity; it is, indeed, much like a\r\ngold washer, being a series of boxes or troughs through which a\r\ncurrent of water is made to flow; this carries the lighter portions\r\naway from the seeds, the contents of the boxes being agitated from\r\ntime to time. At the close of the process, the clean seed is found in\r\nthe bottoms of the boxes, whence it is removed and carefully dried, by\r\nputting it in an airy place, and stirring it frequently to prevent\r\nmildew and fermentation. Well prepared seed is plump and bright, and\r\nshould feel cold to the hand. When the pips are broken, they should be\r\nwhite and clear within; but the best test of their quality, is to\r\nsprout a portion, and count the plants produced by a given number of\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOWING.--The seeds may be put into the ground, either in the fall, or\r\nspring. The soil having been well prepared, and deeply pulverized, is\r\nthrown up in beds a few feet wide, and the seed sown in close drills\r\nacross; or without the beds, it may be sown in broad drills, by hand,\r\nor with a machine, the rows at such a distance as to allow of culture\r\nby horse-power. It is desirable, in either case, to get an early start\r\nand a good stand; the weeds must be kept under from the very first,\r\nand not allowed to have the mastery for a single day. Thorough culture\r\nduring the season, upon a deeply tilled soil, of such a character as\r\nto retain moisture, will be found highly advantageous in the\r\nproduction of this crop, and will insure immunity from leaf-blight and\r\nother adversities. Some recommend sprouting the seed a little before\r\nplanting. If it have been kept during the winter mixed with its bulk\r\nof sand, which is a good plan, the whole may be subjected to a gentle\r\nheat as in a hot-bed, for a few days, just before planting. During\r\nthis time the mass must be stirred and turned every day, to prevent\r\nfermentation and to secure an even start. Whenever the germ makes its\r\nappearance at the points of the seeds, which is called _pipping_, the\r\nsowing must begin, and should be done as quickly as possible; the\r\ncovering is to be slight, and the earth should be friable and not\r\ndisposed to bake. The depth at which the apple seed is to be covered\r\nwill depend upon the present and prospective state of the weather,\r\nlighter if moist, heavier if dry, for a continued drouth might be\r\nfatal to sprouted seed, if it were planted too near the surface; but\r\nwhen the weather is not dry, it is advised that the shallower the seed\r\nis sown, the better. The objection has been made to sprouting, that if\r\nthe process have advanced too far, the seedlings will be apt to have a\r\ncrook at or near the collar, instead of the straight fusiform\r\nappearance they should possess when presented to the grafter.\r\n\r\nThese seedlings furnish the stocks upon which to work the finer\r\nvarieties of the apple. They are taken up in the autumn with their\r\nlong clean roots, which are often longer than their tops, the leaves\r\nare stripped off, and they are assorted; the larger are packed away in\r\nearth or saw-dust in the grafting department, or heeled-in out of\r\ndoors, and covered in such a way as to be accessible at any time they\r\nmay be needed during the winter. The smaller stocks are heeled-in for\r\nspring planting in nursery rows for budding, or they may be left in\r\nthe original rows for another year's growth as seedlings. If the\r\nplants have been well grown and not too thick, so that the majority\r\nare of sufficient size, it will be better to take them all up at once\r\nand assort them as just indicated, otherwise the largest only may be\r\ndrawn separately when the ground is soft with autumnal rains, leaving\r\nthe smaller seedlings for another year's growth. In assorting and\r\nselling the stocks, nurserymen make about three classes. The very\r\nlargest, as thick as a lead-pencil, are called extra, or two-year\r\nold, and command a higher price. The next size, called 1st class\r\nstocks, are large enough for co-aptation to the average scions, and\r\nlong enough to make two cuts each for grafting; and those that fall\r\nbelow this requisition are considered second class, and are either\r\nthrown aside or set out for budding, and for stock or collar-grafting\r\nin the rows.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION.--SECTION II.--GRAFTING.\r\n\r\n  A MODIFICATION OF CUTTINGS.

TREATMENT OF GRAFTS.\r\n\r\nGrafting is but a modification of propagation by cuttings. The scion\r\nis a cutting of the variety we wish to propagate, which, instead of\r\nbeing committed to the ground to emit its own roots, is placed in\r\ncontact with tissues of a nature similar to its own, through which it\r\nis to form a connection with the roots and the soil. The success of\r\nthe operation depends upon the formative cell in this instance also,\r\nas in the cutting; new cells are formed upon the cut surface, and the\r\nintercommunication takes place through them. Hence we have anatomical\r\nlimits to grafting; there are physiological bounds beyond which we\r\ncannot pass, in our combinations of scion and stock. Our success is in\r\nthe direct ratio of the affinity that exists between them; thus apple\r\ngrows best on apple, and even among these we find the _closest union_\r\nand the best results, where there is a similarity between the style of\r\ngrowth, and probably in the character of the cells.\r\n\r\nWe say, as a general rule, that stone fruits must be grafted upon\r\nstone fruits, those bearing seeds, upon seed fruit; but there are\r\nlimits even here which confine us upon one hand, and give us more\r\nlatitude upon the other. Thus the cherry may be worked upon the wild\r\ncherry (_Prunus Virginiana_) but it forms a very poor union; the pear\r\nwill grow upon the thorn, which has a very different seed, but the\r\nunion is very imperfect and the tree is short-lived; the apple would\r\nappear to be much nearer of kin, since it belongs to the same genus,\r\nbut though the pear will grow vigorously upon this stock, it is no\r\nmore permanent than upon the thorn: either of them will answer when\r\ngrafted low, or in the root, to start the cutting, as the scion may\r\nthen be considered, and to sustain it until it shall have supplied\r\nitself with roots. In top-grafting the pear upon a tree of either\r\nspecies, it is found essential to success, and it conduces to the\r\ngreater durability of the tree, for some branches of the original\r\nstock to be left intact to secure the circulation of the trunk, as the\r\nunion of the dissimilar cells is so imperfect that it does not furnish\r\nsufficient vent for the sap. In the case of the cherry we find that\r\nthe varieties appear to have a greater affinity for those of their\r\nown race; thus the Dukes and Morellos do well when grafted upon the\r\nMorello stocks, whereas the Hearts and Bigarreau sorts do not make a\r\ngood union upon these stocks, but prefer the Mazzard, which has a\r\nfreer growth more like their own. Most varieties will do well upon the\r\nMahaleb stock, which is used as a means of dwarfing this fruit, though\r\nnot a dwarf. Upon the wild cherry, which belongs to quite a different\r\nsection of the genus, the cultivated varieties will grow, but they\r\nform a very imperfect union.\r\n\r\nThe peach may be worked upon the plum stock, and is claimed to be\r\nsomewhat dwarfed by it, and to produce superior fruit. This stock is\r\nmore congenial to the apricot, which is frequently propagated upon it.\r\nBoth plums and apricots may be worked upon the peach stock, and they\r\nwill grow very vigorously, as they will upon the wild plum, but they\r\nsoon over-grow, and are very apt to break off. When either of these\r\nspecies is used as a stock for the plum or apricot, they should be\r\nconsidered merely as a nursing mother, like the apple or thorn to the\r\npear, which may be wanted to help the cutting until it shall be\r\nprepared to stand alone, and feed itself from its own roots. In other\r\nwords, they should be grafted, _not budded_, into these uncongenial\r\nstocks, and the operation should be performed in the collar or below\r\nit, in the root, so that the growing scion may be earthed up, and\r\nencouraged to furnish itself with a good system of roots of its own.\r\nThe success will then depend upon the ability of the scion to emit\r\nroots freely.\r\n\r\nWe must never forget that in grafting, we are confined to very narrow\r\nlimits. Our scion must be of a similar nature with the stock, each\r\nmust have cells of a similar character, capable of transmitting their\r\nnutritious fluids from one to the other. We must recollect likewise,\r\nthat the parts must be so co-apted that the cells of wood growth shall\r\nbe brought into as close connection as possible, in both scion and\r\nstock; these cells are found in the layer, called the cambium, which\r\nis between the wood and the bark. The crude sap from below will often\r\npass from cell to cell, when the elaborated sap of the cells in the\r\nscion is wholly unfitted for the formation of wood cells in the stock\r\nbelow it; of course the union in such a case must be very imperfect,\r\nand the product of such a grafting will be subject to accident, and\r\nwill be short-lived, though the result in fruit, while the union\r\ncontinues, may be very precocious, abundant, and of superior flavor.\r\n\r\nNatural grafting may often be observed by the student of nature when\r\nwandering among his favorites of the sylvan shades. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the first hint was thus communicated to the early\r\ngardeners. In nature we always find the grafting to be inarching, or\r\ngrafting by approach; two limbs or even two trees approximating\r\nclosely, have abraded one another, and have afterward united their\r\ntissues most firmly together. This is generally a union of two trees\r\nof the same variety or species; but such is not always the case;\r\nsometimes trees of very dissimilar natures unite in this manner, but\r\nwhen we examine them we find only a dove-tailing, only a mechanical\r\nunion, but no vital action subsists between them. The ancients give us\r\nsome fancy sketches of the unions by grafting of very dissimilar\r\ntrees, and some moderns who have no higher claim to poetry than their\r\nromancing, tell us that we may graft the peach upon the Willow and\r\nButtonwood, and form other equally impossible unions.\r\n\r\nThe different methods of performing the operation of grafting vary\r\nwith the character and size, and condition of the stocks to be worked;\r\nthus we have splice grafting, whip, cleft, saddle, and side grafting\r\nwith modifications, and also grafting by approach, which is generally\r\ncalled inarching--though sometimes also practiced where we desire to\r\nrenew the roots of a tree that are unhealthy, or to restore those that\r\nhave been removed by accident or by the erosion of some rodent\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLICE GRAFTING is the simplest process, and is applicable only where\r\nthe size of the stock and of the scion correspond pretty nearly; the\r\ntwo are cut with a sloping curve, each of which being made at the same\r\nangle, will coincide with the other when they are applied together, as\r\nrepresented in the engraving, fig. 7.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--WHIP GRAFTING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHIP GRAFTING is a modification of the above. Each portion is cut in a\r\nsloping manner as in the splice grafting, but each is also split with\r\na thin-bladed knife, as represented in fig. 8. The object in this is\r\nto give a firmer union to the two portions, and also to present a more\r\nextended surface for the effusion of the new cell tissue that is to\r\nform the bond of union in cementing them together. In both these\r\nmethods, but especially in the first, the parts must be held together\r\nin co-aptation by some kind of bandage; this is generally composed of\r\ngrafting wax, spread upon cloth or paper, or even, as now extensively\r\npracticed, upon fine thread. Cotton yarn _No_. 3 is drawn through\r\nmelted grafting wax, and as it cools, it is wound upon a reel at the\r\nother side of the room, whence it is drawn as wanted by the grafter or\r\ntyer. Tying or wrapping is always a good precaution, and when the\r\nsplice or cleft graft is not very close, it becomes necessary; but\r\nthousands of grafts will unite equally well where the parts are\r\ncovered with earth, without any such appliance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--DIFFERENT STEPS IN CLEFT GRAFTING. _A_,\r\n    SCION PREPARED FOR SETTING. _B_, THE CLEFT OPENED BY A WEDGE.\r\n    _C_, THE SCION INSERTED. _D_, SECTION OF STOCK AND SCION TO SHOW\r\n    THE CO-APTATION OF THE PARTS OF THE TWO.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--CLEFT GRAFTING WITH BOTH SCIONS\r\n    INCLINED INWARD.]\r\n\r\nCLEFT GRAFTING is generally done when the stock is larger than the\r\nscion, and also where the operation is performed at a point above the\r\nground. The stock is split downward, after having been cut off at the\r\npoint where the grafting is to be done. The knife should be sharp, and\r\nthe bark should be cut through first, to avoid its being torn, and so\r\nthat the sides of the cleft shall be smooth. A wedge is inserted to\r\nkeep the cleft open for the insertion of the scion, which is cut on\r\neach side like a fine wedge; but the two planes not being parallel,\r\nthe bark will be left on one side to the very point of the wedge,\r\nwhile on the other it will be removed a part of the way, making a\r\nfeather edge, _A_, fig. 9. The object of this is to have the pressure\r\nof the cleft greatest upon the outer side, where the union is to be\r\neffected. It is well to have a bud on the strip of bark left between\r\nthe two cuts used in forming the graft, this should be near the top of\r\nthe cleft. One or two grafts may be inserted into a cleft, or more\r\nclefts may be made, in large stocks, or in re-grafting the large limbs\r\nof an old tree, but usually one is sufficient to leave growing; and in\r\nthe young tree, only one should ever be allowed to remain. When the\r\nscion is nicely set into the cleft, so that the inner bark of the\r\nstock and graft shall coincide, or rather cross a very little, (see\r\nfig. 10,) the wedge, whether of hard wood, or of iron, should be\r\ngently withdrawn, and then the elasticity of the stock will hold the\r\nscion firmly to its place; this pressure should not be too severe. In\r\nthis kind of grafting, if the pressure be sufficiently firm, and if\r\nthe operation have been performed below the surface of the ground, it\r\nmay not be necessary to make any other application than to press the\r\nmoist earth about the parts, and cover all but the top of the graft\r\nwith soil, and place a stick to indicate the plant and protect it from\r\ninjury. If, on the contrary, the pressure of the cleft be not\r\nsufficient to hold the scion firmly, as in small stocks, the graft\r\nmust be tied. For this a piece of bass matting, or cotton twine, may\r\nbe used; and if the operation has been performed above ground, the\r\nwhole must be covered with grafting wax, applied, either hot with a\r\nbrush, or cold, after having been worked with the hands, or by\r\nwrapping with strips of muslin or paper previously spread with the\r\nwax. In old times grafting clay was used, and applied with the hands\r\nas a lump around the junction; but this disagreeable and clumsy\r\nappliance has given way to more elegant and convenient arrangements.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11--SIDE GRAFTING.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12--SIDE GRAFTING--THE STOCK NOT CUT BACK.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--TWO FORMS OF SIDE GRAFTING.--_A_, _B_,\r\n    THE SCION AND STOCK FOR THE RICHARD SIDE GRAFT. _C_, STOCK FOR\r\n    THE GIRARDIN SIDE GRAFT. _D_, SCION, AND _E_, FRUIT BUD FOR THE\r\n    SAME.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDE GRAFTING is performed in two ways. In one it is a modification of\r\ncleft grafting in which there is no cleft, but the bark is started\r\nfrom the wood, and the scion, cut as shown in figure 11, is pressed\r\ndown between the wood and bark. This can only be done late in the\r\nspring, after the sap has begun to flow in the stock, so that the bark\r\nwill run; it is indeed more like budding than grafting. The other\r\nmodification is done without cutting off the stock. The knife is\r\napplied to the side of a stock of medium size, and a cut is made\r\ndownward and extending to one-third the diameter, fig. 12; the scion\r\nis cut as for cleft grafting, and inserted so as to have the parts\r\nwell co-apted, and then secured as usual. This plan is useful where\r\nthere is danger of too free a flow of sap from the roots. Two other\r\nkinds of side graft are shown in fig. 13. The left-hand figures show\r\nthe Richard side graft, in which an arched branch, _A_, is used. This\r\nis inserted under the bark of the stock, _B_; above the graft an\r\nincision is made in the stock down to the wood, to arrest the flow of\r\nsap. After the insertion, the wound is covered with grafting wax. The\r\nGirardin side graft is illustrated at the three right-hand figures. A\r\nfruit bud, _E_, or a graft with a terminal fruit bud, _D_, is inserted\r\nunder the bark of the stock, _C_, in August, or whenever suitable buds\r\ncan be obtained and the bark will run. The wound is tied and covered\r\nwith wax, as before. The object of this grafting is to secure\r\nimmediate fruitage. Another kind of side grafting consists in plunging\r\na dirk-shaped knife directly through the tree, inclining the point\r\ndownward, into this opening the graft is inserted; the object being to\r\nestablish a limb on a naked portion of the trunk.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--SADDLE GRAFTING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSADDLE GRAFTING is used only with stocks of small size; it is\r\nperformed by making a double slope upon the stock, and by opening a\r\ncorresponding space in the graft, by cutting two slopes in the scion,\r\nfrom below upwards, so that they shall meet in the centre, as seen in\r\n_fig._ 14. Some merely split the scion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTING BY APPROACH, or as it is generally termed, _inarching_, is\r\noften practiced where there is difficulty in making the scion unite\r\nwith the stock; it is not often needed in the culture of our orchard\r\nfruits, but may be here described. The stock upon which we wish to\r\ngraft the scion, must be planted near the variety or species to be\r\nincreased. A small twig of the latter, which can be brought close to\r\nthe stock, is selected for the operation; a slice of bark and wood is\r\nthen removed from the twig, and another of equal size from the stock,\r\nso managed, that these cut surfaces can be brought together and\r\nsecured in that position until they have united, after which the twig,\r\nthat has been used as a scion, is cut from its parent tree, and the\r\ntop of the stock is carefully reduced until the scion has sufficiently\r\ndeveloped itself to act as the top of the ingrafted tree, which may\r\nafterward be transplanted to its proper station.\r\n\r\nA modification of this grafting by approach, is, however, sometimes of\r\ngreat service, where we have a valuable tree that has suffered from\r\ndisease in the roots, or from injury to them. It consists in planting\r\nsome thrifty young stocks, with good roots, about the base of the\r\ntree, after having prepared the ground by thorough digging, and by the\r\naddition of good soil if necessary. These stocks are then inserted\r\nupwards into the healthy portion of the trunk, by the process of side\r\ngrafting reversed or inverted, or by the usual method of inarching.\r\n\r\n\r\nRING GRAFTING OR BARK GRAFTING is not much used, and in small stocks\r\nit is rather a kind of budding, for then a ring of bark is removed at\r\nthe proper season of year, generally about midsummer, and it is\r\nreplaced by a similar ring of bark from a shoot of the same size,\r\ntaken from a tree of the variety to be propagated; this ring of bark\r\nmust be furnished with a healthy bud. This method has little to\r\nrecommend it, and can only be applied when both the stock and the\r\nscion are in a growing condition, so that the bark will run freely;\r\ncare also must be exercised to avoid injuring the eye of the bud, in\r\npeeling off the ring. A modification of bark grafting may be applied\r\nwith great advantage, however, to an old tree, that has met with an\r\ninjury to a portion of its bark. The injured part should be pared\r\nsmoothly to the sound bark and wood. This may be done with a sloping\r\ncut, or the edge may be made abrupt and square with a chisel and\r\nmallet; a piece of fresh wood and bark is then to be cut from a\r\nhealthy tree and fitted precisely to the fresh wound, and secured in\r\nits place with bandages, and grafting clay or wax is then applied,\r\nthus making what the surgeons would call a sort of taliacotian\r\noperation. Instead of a single piece of wood and bark, a number of\r\nyoung shoots may be used to make the communication complete; these are\r\nset close together and secured in the usual manner; see fig. 15.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--BARK GRAFTING, TO REPAIR AN INJURED\r\n    TREE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRE-GRAFTING OLD ORCHARDS.--Old orchards of inferior fruit may be\r\nentirely re-made and re-formed by grafting the limbs with such\r\nvarieties as we may desire. A new life is by this process often\r\ninfused into the trees, which is due to the very severe pruning which\r\nthe trees then receive; they are consequently soon covered with a\r\nvigorous growth of young healthy wood, which replaces the decrepid and\r\noften decaying spray that accumulates in an old orchard, and the fruit\r\nproduced for several years by the new growth is not only more\r\nvaluable in kind, according to the judgment used in the selection of\r\ngrafts, but it is more fair, smooth and healthy, and of better size\r\nthan that which was previously furnished by the trees. Certain\r\nvarieties are brought at once into bearing when thus top-grafted,\r\nwhich would have been long in developing their fruitful condition if\r\nplanted as nursery trees. Others are always better and finer when so\r\nworked, than on young trees. Some of the finest specimens of the\r\nNorthern Spy apple, exhibited at the fairs, have been produced by\r\ngrafts inserted into the terminal branches of old bearing trees. There\r\nis a theory held by some orchardists, that the further the junction of\r\nthe graft with the stock is removed from the root, the better will be\r\nthe fruit. This, however, is not well supported, and the circumstance,\r\nwhen observed, is probably dependent upon other causes.\r\n\r\nIn renewing an old orchard by grafting its head, it will not be a good\r\nplan to attempt the whole tree at once; the pruning would be too\r\nsevere, and would be followed by a profusion of succulent shoots\r\nbreaking out from the large branches, such as are called\r\nwater-sprouts. Those who have practiced most, prefer at first, to\r\nremove about one-third of the limbs for grafting, and those should be\r\nselected at the top of the tree. The new growth thus has an open field\r\nfor its development, and the lower limbs will be invigorated, while\r\nthey tend also to preserve the equilibrium of the tree in a double\r\nsense, physically and physiologically. The next year another third of\r\nthe limbs may be grafted, and the remainder the year following, as\r\npracticed by Mr. Geo. Olmstead, of Connecticut, who, on the sixth\r\nyear from the first grafting, harvested 28-½ bushels of choice apples\r\nfrom a single tree that was 75 years old, and which before only\r\nproduced inferior fruit. J.J. Thomas recommends, \"to give a\r\nwell-shaped head to such newly formed trees, and to prevent the\r\nbranches from shooting upward in a close body near the centre of the\r\ntree; that the old horizontal boughs should be allowed to extend to a\r\ndistance in each direction, while the upright ones should be lopped;\"\r\nsee fig. 16. The same writer also advises, \"instead of cutting off\r\nlarge branches and grafting them at once, it is better to prune the\r\ntop in part, which will cause an emission of vigorous shoots. These\r\nare then budded, or grafted. * * * And as the grafts gradually extend\r\nby growth, the remainder of the top may, by successive excisions, be\r\nentirely removed.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--RENEWAL OF THE TOP OF AN OLD TREE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTING IN THE NURSERY is either done at or near the collar of the\r\nstock, or it is performed in-doors upon the roots or sections of\r\nroots of young stocks. The latter may be first described, as it\r\nconstitutes the most extensive means of multiplying fruit trees. It is\r\na sort of machinery, with division of labor, and appliances, that\r\nenable the operators to turn out immense numbers. Machinery has indeed\r\nbeen applied to the business; we have grafting apparatus to facilitate\r\nthe work. The Minkler machine consists of a frame or gauge which\r\nregulates the angle of the slope, which is cut with a broad chisel\r\nthat reduces the roots and scions to a condition for putting them\r\ntogether; by its use an immense number of grafts can be cut, and\r\nanother hand binds them together with the waxed thread, without any\r\ntie. Mr. Robey's machine consists of a complicated shears to cut the\r\nslope and tongue at one operation, preparing the pieces for whip\r\ngrafting. Mr. S.S. Jackson, of Cincinnati, has also invented an\r\napparatus for this purpose, which proves to be very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT GRAFTING.--The methods of performing the operation vary somewhat,\r\nbut all agree in the object to be attained: the co-aptation of the\r\nscion with a piece of root. Some grafters use only the upper portion\r\nof the root, thinking the original collar of the seedling stock the\r\nonly point at which the most perfect and successful union between the\r\naërial and terrestrial portions of trees should or can be\r\neffected--theoretically this may be very well, but the practice\r\nconstantly pursued, in myriads of cases, abundantly proves that the\r\ngrafting need not be restricted to this part, and that a perfect union\r\nmay be effected at any point of the root, and that this may even be\r\ninverted. The very common practice has been to take two or more cuts\r\nfrom the root, when it is of sufficient size and length; and though\r\nsome of our best propagators restrict themselves to two cuts from\r\neach, others, who have experimented carefully, insist that the third\r\nsection will average as well as the others. A lot of trees, worked\r\nespecially for a test in this matter, gave the following results.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 an average lot of roots and scions, about fifty in each lot,\r\nwere treated as follows, White Pippin and Willow-leaf being used as\r\nscions:--\r\n\r\nWhite Pippin--No. 1, being on the first cut of the root, had made a\r\nfair growth.\r\n\r\nNo. 2, being on the second cut, were quite as good or better.\r\n\r\nNo. 3, being on the third cut, were not quite so good as the others,\r\nthe ground being partially shaded by a large tree.\r\n\r\nAnother, of Willow-leaf--No. 1, on the 3d cut of root, very good\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nNo. 2, on very slender roots, nearly as good.\r\n\r\nNo. 3, only 1 inch of root to 1 inch of scion; not so good growth nor\r\nso good a strike, but shaded by a tree.\r\n\r\nNo. 4, on 2d cut of root, not so good as the third.\r\n\r\nNo. 5, on average lot, not waxed, as good as any.\r\n\r\nNo. 6, roots worked upside-down, mostly failed.\r\n\r\nD.O. Reeder exhibited some 2-year old apple trees, worked on the root\r\ninverted, they were of very good growth.\r\n\r\nFor root grafting, thrifty stocks are wanted of one or two years'\r\ngrowth, the smoother and straighter the roots, the better. These\r\nshould be taken up from the seed-bed in the fall, selected, tied in\r\nbundles, and stored in the cellar or cave, or buried in the soil where\r\nthey shall be accessible at any time, and where they will be kept\r\nfresh and plump. The roots and scions having been prepared and under\r\nshelter, the work of grafting may proceed at any time during the\r\nwinter. The stocks, if not clean, should be washed, and one hand trims\r\noff the side rootlets. The grafter cuts a hundred scions of the\r\nappropriate length, which he puts into a shallow box on the table; he\r\ntakes up a stock, cuts the slope near the collar, and a dextrous hand\r\nwill at the same time make the sloping cut to receive the first graft\r\nand also the tongue, if that style of grafting is to be done, as is\r\nusually practised. He then picks up a scion, from a lot which himself\r\nor another hand has already prepared with a slope and tongue, and\r\nadapts it to the root, the tongue keeping the two together; a portion\r\nof the root is then cut off with the graft, and the process is\r\nrepeated upon the next section. Two or three or more grafts, are thus\r\nmade from one seedling root; the length of the sections vary from two\r\nto four inches, according to the fancy of the operator, or of his\r\nemployer. Some persons recommend a long scion with a short root, and\r\nothers prefer to reverse those terms. The whole root graft should not\r\nbe more than six or seven inches long.\r\n\r\nWhen any given number of scions are fitted to the roots, a boy\r\ncompletes the process of grafting, by applying melted wax with a\r\nbrush, in which case they are dropped into water to harden the wax, or\r\nthey are wrapped with waxed strips of muslin or paper, or, better\r\nstill, they are tied with waxed thread. No. 3 cotton yarn is drawn\r\nthrough a pan of melted wax, and wound upon a reel placed at the other\r\nside of the room, so that the wax may harden. This waxed thread is a\r\nvery convenient tie; the graft being held in the left hand, the thread\r\nis wound about it two or three turns; as the wax causes the bandage\r\nto adhere to itself where it crosses, no knot is needed, and the\r\nthread is broken off with a quick jerk.\r\n\r\nIn splice grafting, whether performed with any of the machines, or if\r\nthe slopes of root and scion be cut with the thin grafting knife, the\r\ntying must be done by the same hand that selects and places the scion\r\nupon the root. This does not admit of the same division of labor, and\r\nthe fingers, becoming sticky from the wax, cannot be so nimble, and\r\nare unfit for cutting. When the lot is tied, they are set into the\r\nbox, which should be inclined at an angle, and interspersed with earth\r\nor saw-dust; for transportation. Saw-dust, just as it comes from the\r\nmill, neither wet nor dry, is preferred by some as a packing material,\r\nand it has been found very efficacious, excluding and admitting the\r\nair just in the right proportions to prevent desiccation, and to\r\npromote the union, which very soon takes place between the graft and\r\nthe root, if the boxes be stored in the cellar. In an ice-house root\r\ngrafts have been kept in saw-dust more than a year, and then planted\r\nand grown successfully. The boxes should be deep enough to receive the\r\nwhole graft--say from 10 to 12 inches--and then they can be packed\r\nupon one another without injuring the scions; these should be\r\ndistinctly marked with the name and number, so as to be ready for\r\nplanting out in the spring.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has been had upon the merits and demerits, or\r\ndisadvantages of root grafting, and much theoretical argument has been\r\nbrought against the practice; but beautiful trees are thus made in\r\nimmense numbers in the extensive nurseries of our country, and until\r\nbetter arguments can be produced against the practice, nurserymen\r\nwill continue to graft on sections of root, such varieties, as are\r\nsuitable for this procedure--especially apples, in a large proportion\r\nof the varieties cultivated, some pears, some peaches, grapes, and\r\nother fruits.\r\n\r\nRoot grafting is now of almost universal application with the apple.\r\nIt has many advantages, which may be summed up as follows: Two or more\r\nplants may be produced from the root of one stock; these may be made\r\nwith great rapidity; the work may all be performed in-doors and during\r\nthe whole winter season, when nothing can be done outside; they are of\r\nsmall bulk, and great numbers may be stowed away in little space, they\r\nmay be transported to any distance in this condition, and are ready\r\nfor planting with the opening of spring, when they may be set in the\r\nnursery rows at once; or, they may be bedded out in a small space and\r\nmulched, to protect them from drouth, and the weeds can easily be kept\r\nunder. Another advantage of bedding out the root-grafts is, that they\r\nmay be assorted according to their size the next season, when\r\ntransplanted into the nursery rows. This very transplanting too is a\r\ngreat advantage, for the roots will be much improved by the process.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical objections to root grafts have yielded to sound\r\nphilosophy, based on and supported by practical observation. The very\r\nmany advantages of this more economical and convenient and agreeable\r\nprocess, will necessarily sustain root-grafting in this fast age, when\r\nso many millions of trees are needed for the rapidly extending wants\r\nof this nation of tree planters. We may, however, consider some of the\r\npractical objections which have been brought forward against this\r\nplan of multiplying the apple. In our very changeable climate, and\r\nparticularly in the North-west, upon the prairies, the cold of winter\r\noften supervenes with great suddenness, after the young trees have\r\nmade a prolonged and vigorous growth in the fertile soil, and produces\r\nterrible devastation among those that are there exposed, without\r\nprotection of any kind, to the rude blasts of the storm-king: in a\r\nless degree, injury is very frequent with many such late-growing\r\nkinds, at the first access of a severe frost; this is manifested in\r\nthe bursting of the bark near the base of the stem. The same thing is\r\nnot so often seen in the same varieties, when they have been budded or\r\nstock grafted a foot or more from the ground upon hardy seedling\r\nstocks, hence judicious propagators have selected the \"tender\"\r\nvarieties for this kind of working, and confine their root-grafting to\r\nthose less liable to the injury. There are other varieties which do\r\nnot readily and promptly form a strong upright growth, so as to be\r\nprofitable trees to the nurseryman if root grafted; these are selected\r\nfor stock working, either on strong seedlings, or upon hardy upright\r\nsorts that have been root grafted for the purpose of being thus\r\ndouble-worked. This plan has been pursued to a limited extent only,\r\nbut its advantages in the production of good trees of the slender\r\ngrowing varieties, begin to be appreciated, and as the demand\r\nincreases, our intelligent nurserymen will very soon furnish the\r\nrequisite supply.\r\n\r\n_Planting._--When the weather is fine, and the soil in good condition,\r\nthe root-grafts are to be set out with a dibble, by the line; they\r\nshould be planted rather deeply, one bud projecting above the surface\r\nof the ground. The culture must be thorough, the plants should be\r\nkept perfectly clean, but it is questionable whether the growth should\r\nbe pushed, late in the season; indeed, it is preferable to check the\r\nvegetation at mid-summer. For this purpose it has been recommended to\r\ncease cultivating the soil, or even to sow the ground with a heavy\r\nseeding of oats, so as to check the growth before winter. In good\r\nsoils, with good culture, the average hight in the rows will be two\r\nfeet, but there is a great difference in the kinds; some will\r\nconsiderably exceed this hight. Intelligent nurserymen no longer\r\nendeavor to have an excessive growth in the first year, and many\r\nprefer the bedding plan above alluded to.\r\n\r\n_Trimming, Pinching, or Heading._--The growth during the first year is\r\ngenerally a single shoot, sometimes two. If there be a second, it\r\nshould be subordinated by pinching off its extremity, never by\r\ntrimming it off; indeed, laterals should always be encouraged, and\r\nthis will be more and more the case, since the demand for low-headed\r\ntrees is increasing, as the laws of physiology are better understood.\r\nA young tree, well furnished with laterals, is always more stocky, and\r\nevery way better, though not so tall as that which has been drawn up\r\nto a single stem. To encourage this condition, some advise the\r\npinching out the terminal bud in the midst of the growing season,\r\nwhich will cause the swelling and subsequent breaking of the lower\r\nbuds, so as to furnish plenty of laterals. If done later in the\r\nseason, especially with strong-growing varieties, a branching head may\r\nbe formed higher up, during the first season, making very pretty\r\ntrees. This is, however, seldom attempted with root-grafts the first\r\nseason, though it is very common for collar-grafted trees, and for\r\nbuds on strong stocks to make a fine branching growth the first year.\r\nThe second season the trees should all be headed-in, and the laterals\r\nspurred-in early in the spring, or in mild weather during the winter,\r\nif the scions are wanted. This method of making stocky plants cannot\r\nbe too highly commended, nor can the opposite plan, of trimming off\r\nall the side branches, and even of stripping the leaves from the lower\r\npart of the shoots, during the first summer, be too severely\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCK GRAFTING has many advocates, and for some varieties this plan is\r\npreferable. The union may be effected at any point from the collar\r\nupward. Formerly, the place was selected to suit the convenience of\r\nthe grafter, and many old orchards show very plainly where they were\r\nworked, the stock or the scion having overgrown, and it is very\r\ncurious that some varieties may be indicated as good feeders of the\r\nstock below them, and the contrary. At present, tree planters are more\r\nfastidious, and object to these irregularities in the stems of their\r\ntrees. They will purchase nothing that shows the point of union above\r\nground, hence the more common use of collar grafting, as it has been\r\ncalled, or the insertion of the scion at or near the surface of the\r\nground. Stocks that have been cultivated one or two years in the\r\nnursery row, are selected for this purpose; the earth is removed from\r\nthem, they are cut off and grafted as they stand, and with their fine\r\nstrong roots undisturbed, the result of one summer's growth is very\r\nsatisfactory, making beautiful trees fit for the orchard. Older trees,\r\nespecially those with straight clean stems, are often grafted standard\r\nhigh, so as to produce a fine salable tree at once, or in one season.\r\nThis is a very good plan with some of the slender and straggling\r\nvarieties, such as are called poor growers, and which are unprofitable\r\nto the nurseryman when propagated in the usual manner. Grafting or\r\nbudding upon such stocks is also resorted to very often, when it is\r\ndesirable at once to furnish large, or salable trees of new varieties.\r\n\r\nIn grafting upon a large stock, or upon the tops of an old tree, the\r\nprocess called cleft grafting is generally used. Here, as in all forms\r\nof this process, the object to be attained, is the co-aptation of the\r\ninner bark of both stock and scion. The latter is held in its place by\r\nthe clasping of the former, and is also covered by some material that\r\nis pliant, and which will exclude the air and moisture.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of stock-grafting are the changing of an old tree from\r\nbad to good fruit, which is produced in a few years; it is also\r\napplicable to large stocks, and produces an immediate result, making\r\nsalable trees in one year. It is also desirable for some poor-growing\r\nvarieties, which are slow in making a tree from the ground; but it has\r\nits disadvantages also. The nurseryman must wait until his stocks have\r\nbeen grown one or more years in the nursery, his trees will sometimes\r\nbe larger than he desires, they will be apt to have the mark of the\r\ngrafting as a blemish upon the stalk sometimes during the life of the\r\ntree; and worse than all, he is restricted to a brief period in the\r\nspring, when he is obliged to perform the operation out of doors, and\r\noften in very unpleasant weather.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all the discussions upon this subject, it is found that\r\nstock-grafting, whether at the collar or at some distance above the\r\nground, is still practiced, and has many warm advocates, as a better\r\nmeans of making the best trees. The only objections are the greater\r\nexpense of culture of the stocks, and greater labor in grafting; the\r\nlimited period at which the work can be performed, and the exposure of\r\nthe workman during its performance, which is often at a stormy season,\r\nand always during a busy portion of the year. The trees too, in the\r\norchard, are often somewhat deformed by an irregularity of growth, and\r\nhave an enlargement either above or below the union, which is\r\nunsightly.\r\n\r\nThe kind of grafting will depend upon the size of the stocks; splice\r\nand whip-grafting on the smaller, and cleft-grafting on the larger\r\nones, must be practiced. The waxing may be done by any of the methods\r\nindicated, according to the fancy; but it must always be more\r\nthoroughly done in aerial, than in underground grafting, whether this\r\nbe in the collar or upon sections of the root; in the former the whole\r\nof the cut surfaces must be covered, to prevent desiccation by the\r\nwinds, or the inroads of insects, or of wet from rains.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAX.--Various combinations of the materials used in the preparation of\r\ngrafting-wax, have been recommended by different operators. The\r\ndesideratum being to have a material that shall be sufficiently\r\npliant, and at the same time firm enough to withstand the elevated\r\ntemperatures to which it may be exposed. A mean is preferred, neither\r\ntoo hard nor too soft, and the proportions of the ingredients are\r\nvaried according as it is proposed to use it out of doors, or in the\r\nhouse, in cold weather or warm.\r\n\r\nA favorite recipe, with a practical nurseryman of great experience,\r\nis:\r\n\r\n    Rosin, six parts,   }\r\n    Bees-wax, one part, } melted together.\r\n    Tallow, one part,   }\r\n\r\nThis is to be used warm, when grafting in the house.\r\n\r\nFor out-door work he used the following:\r\n\r\n    Rosin, four or five parts.\r\n    Bees-wax, one and one-half to two parts.\r\n    Linseed oil, one to one and one-half.\r\n\r\nThis is made into a mass to be applied by hand. A very pleasant and\r\nneat mode of using the wax is to pour it when melted, upon thin muslin\r\nor strong paper, and spread it thin with a spatula. The tissue is then\r\ncut into strips of convenient size. The application to cotton yarn for\r\nroot-grafting, has already been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe French use the preparation given below, sufficiently warm to be\r\nliquid, but not so hot as to injure the tissues of the tree, and apply\r\nit with a brush:\r\n\r\n    Black pitch                     28 parts.\r\n    Burgundy pitch                  28 parts.\r\n    Bees-wax                        16 parts.\r\n    Grease                          14 parts.\r\n    Yellow ochre                    14 parts.\r\n                                   ------------\r\n      Making                       100 parts.[14]\r\n\r\nMr. Du Breuil also refers to Leport's liquid mastic in terms of\r\ncommendation, but speaks of it as a secret composition.\r\n\r\nDowning recommends melting together:\r\n\r\n    Bees-wax                    3 parts.\r\n    Rosin                       3 parts.\r\n    Tallow                      2 parts.\r\n\r\nHe says, the common wax of the French is\r\n\r\n    Pitch                one-half pound.\r\n    Bees-wax             one-half pound.\r\n    Cow-dung             one pound.\r\n\r\nTo be boiled together, and laid on with a brush, and for using cold or\r\non strips of muslin, equal parts of tallow, bees-wax, and rosin, some\r\npreferring a little more tallow.\r\n\r\nJ.J. Thomas, whose practical knowledge is proverbial, recommends for\r\nits cheapness\r\n\r\n    Linseed oil              one pint.\r\n    Rosin                    six pounds.\r\n    Bees-wax                 one pound.\r\n\r\nMelted together, to be applied warm with a brush, or to be put on\r\npaper or muslin, or worked with wet hands into a mass and drawn out\r\ninto ribbons.\r\n\r\nThe season for grafting is quite a prolonged one, if we include the\r\nperiod during which it may be done in the house, and the ability we\r\nhave of retarding the scions by cold, using ice. It should be done\r\nwhile the grafts are dormant, which is at any time from the fall of\r\nthe leaf until the swelling of the buds. As the grafts would be likely\r\nto suffer from prolonged exposure, out-door grafting is done just\r\nbefore vegetation commences in the spring, but may be prolonged until\r\nthe stocks are in full leaf, by keeping back the scions, in which\r\ncase, however, there is more danger to the stock unless a portion of\r\nits foliage is allowed to remain to keep up the circulation; under\r\nthese circumstances, too, side-grafting is sometimes used with the\r\nsame view.\r\n\r\nThe stone fruits are worked first; cherries, plums, and peaches, then\r\npears and apples. With regard to grafting grapes, there is a\r\ndiversity of opinion. Some operators prefer very early in the season,\r\nas in February, and others wait until the leaves have appeared upon\r\nthe vine to be grafted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIONS OR GRAFTS are to be selected from healthy plants of the variety\r\nwe wish to propagate. They should be the growth of the previous year,\r\nof average size, well developed, and with good buds, those having\r\nflower buds are rejected. If the shoots be too strong, they are often\r\nfurnished with poor buds, and are more pithy, and therefore they are\r\nmore difficult to work and are less likely to grow. Grafts, cut from\r\nyoung bearing orchards, are the best, and being cut from fruiting\r\ntrees, this enables us to be certain as to correctness of the\r\nvarieties to be propagated; but they are generally and most rapidly\r\ncollected from young nursery trees, and as an orchardist or nurseryman\r\nshould be able to judge of all the varieties he cultivates by the\r\nappearance of their growth, foliage, bark, dots, etc., there is little\r\ndanger in taking the scions from such untested trees.\r\n\r\n_Time for cutting Scions._--The scions may be cut at any time after\r\nthe cessation of growth in the autumn, even before the leaves have\r\nfallen, until the buds burst in the spring, always avoiding severely\r\ncold or frosty weather, because of the injury to the tree that results\r\nfrom cutting at such a time, though the frost may not have injured the\r\nscion. The best nurserymen prefer to cut them in the autumn, before\r\nthey can have been injured by cold. They should be carefully packed in\r\nfine earth, sand, or sawdust, and placed in the cellar or cave. The\r\nleaves stripped from them, make a very good packing material; moss is\r\noften used, where it can be obtained, but the best material is\r\nsaw-dust. This latter is clean, whereas the sand and soil will dull\r\nthe knife. If the scions should have become dry and shriveled, they\r\nmay still be revived by placing them in soil that is moderately moist,\r\nnot wet--they should not, by any means, be placed in water, but should\r\nbe so situated that they may slowly imbibe moisture. When they have\r\nbeen plumped, they should be examined by cutting into their tissues;\r\nif these be brown, they are useless, but if alive, the fresh cut will\r\nlook clear and white, and the knife will pass as freely through them\r\nas when cutting a fresh twig.\r\n\r\nThe after-treatment of the grafts consists in removing the sprouts\r\nthat appear upon the stock below the scion, often in great numbers.\r\nThese are called robbers, as they take the sap which should go into\r\nthe scion. It is sometimes well to leave a portion of these as an\r\noutlet for excess. When the graft is tardy in its vegetation, and in\r\nlate grafting, it is always safest to leave some of these shoots to\r\ndirect the circulation to the part, and thus insure a supply to the\r\nnewly introduced scion; all should eventually be removed, so as to\r\nleave the graft supreme.\r\n\r\nIt may sometimes be necessary to tie up the young shoot which pushes\r\nwith vigor, and may fall and break with its own weight before the\r\nsupporting woody fibre has been deposited; but a much better policy is\r\nto pinch in the tip when but a few inches long, and thus encourage the\r\nswelling and breaking of the lateral buds, and produce a more sturdy\r\nresult. This is particularly the case in stock-grafts and in renewing\r\nan orchard by top-grafting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION.--SECTION III.--BUDDING.\r\n\r\n  ADVANTAGES OF. LONG PERIOD FOR.

RESUME.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDDING, or inoculating, is the insertion of eyes or buds. This is a\r\nfavorite method of propagation, which is practiced in the\r\nmultiplication of a great variety of fruits. The advantages of budding\r\nconsist in the rapidity and facility with which it is performed, and\r\nthe certainty of success which attends it. Budding may be done during\r\na long period of the growing season, upon the different kinds of trees\r\nwe have to propagate. Using but a single eye, it is also economical of\r\nthe scions, which is a matter of some importance, when we desire to\r\nmultiply a new and scarce variety.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed on behalf of the process of budding, that trees,\r\nwhich have been worked in this method, are more hardy and better able\r\nto resist the severity of winter than others of the same varieties,\r\nwhich have been grafted in the root or collar, and also that budded\r\ntrees come sooner into bearing. Their general hardiness will probably\r\nnot be at all affected by their manner of propagation; except perhaps,\r\nwhere there may happen to be a marked difference in the habit of the\r\nstock, such for instance as maturity early in the season, which would\r\nhave a tendency to check the late growth of the scion placed upon\r\nit--the supplies of sap being diminished, instead of continuing to\r\nflow into the graft, as it would do from the roots of the cutting or\r\nroot-graft of a variety which was inclined to make a late autumnal\r\ngrowth. Practically, however, this does not have much weight, nor can\r\nwe know, in a lot of seedling stocks, which will be the late feeders,\r\nand which will go into an early summer rest.\r\n\r\nCertain varieties of our cultivated fruits are found to have a\r\nremarkable tendency to make an extended and very thrifty growth,\r\nwhich, continuing late into the autumn, would appear to expose the\r\nyoung trees to a very severe trial upon the access of the first cold\r\nweather, and we often find them very seriously injured under such\r\ncircumstances; the bark is frequently split and ruptured for several\r\ninches near the ground. The twigs, still covered with abundant\r\nfoliage, are so affected by the frost, that their whole outer surface\r\nis shriveled, and the inner bark and wood are browned; the latter\r\noften becomes permanently blackened, and remains as dead matter in the\r\ncentre of the tree, for death does not necessarily ensue. Now\r\nintelligent nurserymen have endeavored to avoid losses from these\r\ncauses, by budding such varieties upon strong well-established stocks,\r\nthough they are aware that these are not more hardy than some of the\r\ncultivated varieties: a given number of seedling stocks has been found\r\nto suffer as much from the severity of winter, as do a similar amount\r\nof the grafted varieties taken at random.[15] That the serious\r\ndifficulty of bark-bursting occurs near the surface of the ground,\r\ndoes seem to be an argument of some weight in favor of budding or\r\nstock-grafting at a higher point. The earlier fruiting of budded trees\r\nthan those which have been root-grafted, does not appear to be a well\r\nestablished fact, and therefore need not detain us; except to observe\r\nthat the stocks, upon which the buds were inserted, might have been\r\nolder by some years than the slip of root upon which the graft was\r\nset, so that the fruiting of the former tree should count two or three\r\nor more years further back than from the period of the budding. There\r\nare so many causes which might have contributed toward this result of\r\nearlier bearing, that we should not be too hasty in drawing\r\nconclusions in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of budding is very similar to that of grafting. The\r\nlatter process is performed when the plant-life is almost dormant, and\r\nthe co-apted parts are ready to take the initiative steps of\r\nvegetation, and to effect their union by means of new adventitious\r\ncells, before the free flow of sap in the growing season. Budding, on\r\nthe contrary, is done in the hight of that season and toward its\r\nclose, when the plants are full of well matured and highly organized\r\nsap, when the cell circulation is most active, and the union between\r\nthe parts is much more immediate than in the graft; were it not so,\r\nindeed, the little shield, with its actively evaporating surface of\r\nyoung bark, must certainly perish from exposure to a hot dry\r\natmosphere. The _cambium_, or gelatinous matter, which is discovered\r\nbetween the bark and the wood when they are separated, is a mass of\r\norganizable cells. Mr. Paxton, using the gardener's expression, calls\r\nit the \"pulp.\" Budding is most successfully performed when this matter\r\nis abundant, for then the vitality of the tree is in greatest degree\r\nof exaltation.\r\n\r\nThe individuality of the bud was sufficiently argued in the first\r\nsection of this chapter, it need not now be again introduced, except\r\nas appropriately to remind us of the fact where the propagation\r\ndepends upon this circumstance--the future tree must spring from the\r\nsingle bud which is inserted. Mr. A.T. Thomson, in his Lectures on the\r\nElements of Botany, page 396, says:--\"The individuality of buds must\r\nhave been suspected as early as the discovery of the art of budding,\r\nand it is fully proved by the dissection of plants. * * Budding is\r\nfounded on the fact, that the bud, which is a branch in embryo, is a\r\ndistinct individual. It is essential that both the bud and the tree\r\ninto which it is inserted should not only be analogous in their\r\ncharacter, as in grafting with the scion, but both must be in a state\r\nof growth at the time the operation is performed. The union, however,\r\ndepends much more upon the bud than upon the stock--the bud may be\r\nconsidered a centre of vitality--vegetative action commences in the\r\nbud, and extends to the stock, connecting them together.\"--\"The vital\r\nenergy, however, which commences the process of organization in the\r\nbud, is not necessarily confined to the germ, nor distinct from that\r\nwhich maintains the growth of the entire plant; but it is so connected\r\nwith organization, that when this has proceeded a certain length, the\r\nbud may be removed from the parent and attached to another, where it\r\nwill become a branch the same as if it had not been removed.\"\r\n\r\nThe season for budding has already been indicated in general terms, it\r\nis usually done in mid-summer and the early part of autumn, reference\r\nbeing had to the condition of the plants to be worked; these should be\r\nin a thrifty growing state, the woody fibre should be pretty well\r\nadvanced, but growth by extension must still be active, or the needful\r\nconditions will not be found. The \"pulp\" must be present between the\r\nbark and the wood of the stock, so that the former can be easily\r\nseparated from the latter; in the language of the art, the bark must\r\n\"run;\" this state of things will soon cease in most stocks, after the\r\nformation of terminal buds on the shoots. The success of spring\r\nbudding, however, would appear to indicate that the cambium layer is\r\nformed earlier in the season than is usually supposed; for whenever\r\nthe young leaves begin to be developed on the stock, \"the bark will\r\nrun,\" and the buds may be inserted with a good prospect of success. In\r\nthis case we are obliged to use dormant buds that were formed the\r\nprevious year, and we have to exercise care in the preservation of\r\nthe scions, to keep them back by the application of cold, until the\r\ntime of their insertion.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the bud is also important to the success of the\r\noperation. The tree from which we cut the scions should be in a\r\ngrowing state, though this is not so essential as in the case of the\r\nstock, as has been seen in spring budding--still, a degree of activity\r\nis desirable. The young shoot should have perfected its growth to such\r\nan extent as to have deposited its woody fibre, it should not be too\r\nsucculent; but the essential condition is, that it should have its\r\nbuds well developed. These, as every one knows, are formed in the\r\naxils of the leaves, and, to insure success, they should be plump and\r\nwell grown. In those fruits which blossom on wood shoots of the\r\nprevious year's growth, as the peach and apricot, the blossom buds\r\nshould be avoided; they are easily recognized by their greater size\r\nand plumpness. In cutting scions, or bud-sticks, the most vigorous\r\nshoots should be avoided, they are too soft and pithy; the close\r\njointed firm shoots, of medium size, are much to be preferred, as they\r\nhave well developed buds, which appear to have more vitality. Such\r\nscions are found at the ends of the lateral branches. These need\r\nimmediate attention, or they will be lost. The evaporation of their\r\njuices through the leaves would soon cause them to wither and wilt,\r\nand become useless. These appendages are therefore immediately removed\r\nby cutting the petioles from a quarter to half an inch from the scion;\r\na portion of the stem is thus left as a convenient handle when\r\ninserting the shield, and this also serves afterward as an index to\r\nthe condition of the bud. So soon as trimmed of their leaves, the\r\nscions are tied up, and enveloped loosely in a damp cloth, or in\r\nmoss, or fresh grass, to exclude them from the air. If they should\r\nbecome wilted, they must not be put into water, as this injures them;\r\nit is better to sprinkle the cloth and tie them up tightly, or they\r\nmay be restored by burying them in moderately moist earth.\r\n\r\nThe early gardeners were very particular as to the kind of weather\r\nupon which to do their budding. They recommended a cloudy or a showery\r\nday, or the evening, in order to avoid the effects of the hot\r\nsunshine. This might do in a small garden, where the operator could\r\nselect his opportunity to bud a few dozen stocks; but even there, wet\r\nweather should be avoided, rather than courted. But in the large\r\ncommercial nurseries, where tens of thousands of buds are to be\r\ninserted, there can be no choice of weather; indeed, many nurserymen\r\nprefer bright sunshine and the hottest weather, as they find no\r\ninconvenience arising to the trees from this source. Some even aver\r\nthat their success is better under such circumstances, and argue that\r\nthe \"pulp is richer.\"\r\n\r\nMost trees in their mature state make all their growth by extension or\r\nelongation very early in the season, by one push, as it were; with the\r\nfirst unfolding of the leaves, comes also the elongation of the twig\r\nthat bears them. In most adult trees in a state of nature, there is no\r\nfurther growth in this way, but the internal changes of the sap\r\ncontinue to be effected among the cells during the whole period of\r\ntheir remaining in leaf, during which there is a continual flow of\r\ncrude sap absorbed by the roots, and taken up into the organism of the\r\ntree to aid in the perfection of all the various parts, and in the\r\npreparation of the proper juice and the several products peculiar to\r\nthe tree, as well as its wood and fruits. When all this is transpiring\r\nwithin its economy, the tree is said to be in its full flow of sap; at\r\nthis stage the young tree is in the best condition for budding, but it\r\ncontinues also, if well cultivated, to grow by extension for a greater\r\nor shorter portion of the season, and this is essential to the success\r\nof the operation as already stated. After the perfecting of the crop\r\nof fruit, the main work of the tree seems to have been done for the\r\nyear, and we often observe, particularly with the summer fruits, that\r\nthe trees appear to go to rest after this period, and begin to cast\r\ntheir foliage. Now, to a certain extent, this is true of the young\r\ntrees. The varieties that ripen their fruit early, make their growth\r\nin the nursery in the earlier portion of the summer, they stop\r\ngrowing, and their terminal bud is formed and is conspicuous at the\r\ntop of the shoots. Very soon the supply of sap appears to be\r\ndiminished, there is no longer so much activity in the circulation,\r\nthe bark cleaves to the wood, it will no longer run, and the season of\r\nbudding for those stocks has reached its terminus; hence the\r\nnurseryman must be upon the look-out for the condition of his trees.\r\nFortunately, those species which have the shortest season, are also\r\nthe first to be ready, the first to mature their buds, and they must\r\nbe budded first. We may commence with the cherry, though the Mahaleb\r\nstock, when it is used, continues in condition longer than other\r\nvarieties, and may be worked late. The plum and pear stocks also\r\ncomplete their growth at an early period in the season; the apple\r\ncontinues longer in good condition, and may be worked quite late.\r\nGrapes, if worked in this way, should be attended to about\r\nmid-season, while they are still growing; but quinces and peaches may\r\nbe kept in a growing state much later than most other stocks, and can\r\nbe budded last of all.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 17.--BUDDING, WITH THE WOOD REMOVED. _b_,\r\n    THE INSIDE OF THE SHIELD SHOWING THE BASE OF THE BUD.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO DO IT.--The stocks being in a suitable condition as above\r\ndescribed, they should be trimmed of their lateral shoots for a few\r\ninches from the ground. This may be done immediately in advance of the\r\nbudder, or it may have been done a few days before the budding. The\r\nstock may be one year old, or two years; after this period they do not\r\nwork so well. The usual method is to make a =T= incision through the\r\nbark of the stock, as low down as possible, but in a smooth piece of\r\nthe stem; some prefer to insert the shield just below the natural site\r\nof a bud. The knife should be thin and sharp, and if the stock be in\r\ngood condition, it will pass through the bark with very little\r\nresistance; but if the stock be too dry, the experienced budder will\r\ndetect it by the different feeling communicated through his knife, by\r\nthe increased resistance to be overcome in making the cut. The custom\r\nhas been to raise the bark by inserting the haft of the budding knife\r\ngently, so as to start the corners of the incision, preparatory to\r\ninserting the bud; but our best budders depend upon the shield\r\nseparating the bark as it is introduced. The bud is cut from the\r\nscion by the same knife, which is entered half an inch above the bud,\r\nand drawn downward about one-third the diameter of the scion, and\r\nbrought out an equal distance below the bud; this makes the shield, or\r\nbud. The authorities direct that the wood should be removed from the\r\nshield before it is inserted; this is a nice operation, requiring some\r\ndexterity to avoid injuring the base of the bud, which constitutes its\r\nconnection with the medulla or pith within the stick. The base of the\r\nbud is represented by _b_, figure 17. Various appliances have been\r\ninvented to aid in this separation, some use a piece of quill, others\r\na kind of gouge; but if the bark run freely on the scion, there will\r\nbe little difficulty in separating the wood from the shield with the\r\nfingers alone. All this may be avoided by adopting what is called the\r\nAmerican method of budding, which consists in leaving the wood in the\r\nshield, (fig. 18, _b_) that should be cut thinner, and is then\r\ninserted beneath the bark without any difficulty, and may be made to\r\nfit closely enough for all practical purposes. Like everything else\r\nAmerican, this is a time-saving and labor-saving plan, and therefore\r\nreadily adopted by the practical nurseryman, who will insert two\r\nthousand in a day.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18.--AMERICAN BUDDING. _b_, THE BUD WITH THE\r\n    WOOD REMAINING.]\r\n\r\nA division of labor is had generally, so far as the tying is\r\nconcerned; for this is done by a boy who follows immediately after the\r\nbudder, and some of these require two smart boys. S.S. Jackson has\r\ncarried this principle of division of labor still further, and, as\r\nappears, with advantage; one hand cuts the shields for another who\r\ninserts them. He never uses the haft of his knife to raise the bark,\r\nbut, after having made the longitudinal cut through the bark, he\r\nplaces the knife in position to make the transverse incision, and as\r\nhe cuts the bark, the edge of the blade being inclined downward, the\r\nshield is placed on the stock close above the knife, which is then\r\nstill further inclined toward the stock, resting upon the shield as a\r\nfulcrum; thus started, the bark will readily yield to the shield,\r\nwhich is then pressed down home into its place.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 19.--MR. JACKSON'S METHOD OF MAKING THE\r\n    INCISION.]\r\n\r\nJ.W. Tenbrook, of Indiana, has invented a little instrument with which\r\nhe makes the longitudinal and transverse incisions, and raises the\r\nbark, all at one operation, and inserts the bud with the other hand.\r\nOn these plans, two persons may work together, one cutting, the other\r\ninserting the buds; these may change work occasionally for rest. In\r\nall cases it is best to have other hands to tie-in the buds, two or\r\nthree boys will generally find full occupation behind a smart budder.\r\nIt will be apparent that the above processes can only be performed\r\nwhen the stock is in the most perfect condition of growth, so that the\r\nbark can be pressed away before the bud; a good workman will not\r\ndesire to bud under any other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn budding, it is found that the upper end of the shield is the last\r\nto adhere to the stock; it needs to be closely applied and pressed by\r\nthe bandage, and if too long, so as to project above the transverse\r\nincision, it should be cut off.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--STICK OF BUDS.]\r\n\r\nAnother expedient for facilitating the operation of budding is made\r\nuse of by some of the nurserymen who grow peach trees extensively. It\r\nconsists in, preparing the stick of buds, as shown in the engraving,\r\nfigure 20. A cut is made, with a sharp knife, through the bark, around\r\neach bud, as in the figure. The budder then removes the buds as they\r\nare wanted, with a slight sidewise pull, and has the shield in the\r\nright condition to insert, without the trouble of removing the wood.\r\nWhen working in this manner, the stick of buds must not be allowed to\r\ndry, and the work must be done at a time when the bark parts with the\r\ngreatest ease.\r\n\r\nAmong the modifications of the process of budding, that, called\r\nring-budding, fig. 21, may be mentioned, rather as a curiosity\r\nhowever, though preferred by some, especially for the grape, which is\r\nsaid to be very easily budded, though we seldom see the operation\r\npracticed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--RING BUDDING.]\r\n\r\nThose who are anxious to commence budding early in the season, prepare\r\nthe scions they expect to use, by pinching the ends and cutting off a\r\nportion of the leaves; the effect of this check to the wood growth is\r\nto hasten the ripening or development of the buds, which rapidly\r\nswell, preparatory to breaking, in their attempt to reproduce the\r\nfoliage that had been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYING should be done as soon as convenient after the buds have been\r\ninserted; though under very favorable circumstances the bud may adhere\r\nand do well without any bandaging, no one thinks of leaving the work\r\nwithout carefully tying in the buds, and most budders lay a great deal\r\nof stress upon the necessity for covering the whole shield and cut\r\nwith a continuous bandaging, that shall exclude the light, and air,\r\nand moisture. The material most used is bass matting, brought from\r\nRussia, as a covering to the packages of sheet iron for which that\r\ncountry is famous. This is the inner bark of the _Tilia Europea_, but\r\nour own Bass-wood, _T. Americana_, furnishes an excellent bass, and is\r\nprocured by our nurserymen directly from the trees, by stripping the\r\nbark in June, and after it has lain a few days in water, the inner\r\nportion separates easily, is dried, and put away for future use. Those\r\nwho have not provided the bass, are content to apply woolen yarn to\r\ntie in the buds; its elasticity adapts it well to the purpose. The\r\ningenious budder, without bass, often finds a substitute for it, and a\r\nvery good tie, in the soft husks of corn ears, the inner husks are\r\ntorn into strips and used a little damp, when they are pliant and\r\neasily tied, answering a very good purpose. Many nurserymen, who have\r\ntried the corn-husk, prefer it to all other material, because it saves\r\nthem the trouble of removing the bandages, as it decays rapidly, and\r\nyielding to the growth of the stock, it falls off before it cuts the\r\nbark, which a firmer bandage is apt to do.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 22.--MR. JACKSON'S MANNER OF TYING THE BUD.]\r\n\r\nS.S. Jackson, whose improvements in budding have already been\r\nmentioned, also adopts another in tying. He holds that it is not at\r\nall necessary to hide the bud with the tie, the only requisite being\r\nto retain the parts in contact. He uses No. 3 cotton yarn, cut in\r\nlengths of a few inches, more or less, according to the size of the\r\nstocks; a couple of strands are pulled out from the cut bundles; the\r\nfirst turn around the stock secures the end of the string by its own\r\npressure, one turn more is taken below the bud and one or two above\r\nit, when the free end is passed into a cleft made through the bark\r\nabove the point where the bud is inserted. This is found to secure the\r\nstring sufficiently, and is easily loosened when necessary to relieve\r\nthe tension caused by the continued growth, (fig. 22).\r\n\r\nAll ties should be loosened in the course of a couple of weeks, if the\r\nstocks be growing freely; otherwise they will injure the tree by\r\nstrangulation. Sometimes it will be necessary to replace the bandage\r\nto prevent the effects of desiccation upon the bud, this is\r\nparticularly the case with the cherry, and other fruits, that are\r\nbudded early; but the tie is often left on the stock all winter, as a\r\nsort of protection to the bud. When loosening the ties, the buds are\r\ninspected and their condition ascertained; if they have failed, they\r\nmay be replaced, if the stocks continue in a suitable condition. It is\r\nvery easy to tell the success of the budding; the portion of the\r\npetiole left upon the shield is a very good index; if the bud has\r\nwithered, this will also be brown and will adhere firmly to the\r\nshield; but, on the contrary, the bud and its shield having formed a\r\nunion with the stock, the leaf-stalk remains plump, but changes color.\r\nLike a leaf-stem in the autumn, it assumes the tint of ripeness, and\r\nit will separate with a touch, and soon falls off.\r\n\r\nThe common method of removing the ties is to cut them with a single\r\nstroke of a sharp knife, when the bandage is left to fall off. Mr.\r\nKnight recommended two distinct ligatures, and left the one above the\r\nbud for a longer time uncut. When the buds have not been very fully\r\ndeveloped, and when the stocks are very thrifty, it sometimes happens\r\nthat the excessive growth about the incisions made for the insertion\r\nof the bud, completely cover up this little germ of a future tree,\r\nwhich is then said to be \"drowned.\" Judicious pinching and shortening\r\nof the stock will prevent this effect, but care is needed not to\r\npursue such treatment too far.\r\n\r\nThe stocks are generally headed back to within an inch or more of the\r\nbud, just as vegetation starts the next spring; but early set buds may\r\nbe headed back so soon as they have taken, and will often make a nice\r\ngrowth the same season. This, however, is not generally preferred, and\r\na late start in the growing weather of our autumns is particularly to\r\nbe avoided, as the young shoot will not become matured before winter,\r\nand may be lost.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of propagating by budding may be summed up in the\r\nfollowing remarks, which are presented even at the risk of some\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\nThis favorite method of multiplying varieties has some advantages over\r\ngrafting, and is by many preferred on account of the facility with\r\nwhich it can be performed, and because it affords a means of\r\nincreasing sorts in the nursery that have not been grafted, and of\r\nfilling up gaps in the rows where grafts have missed; and it has been\r\nreported, that budded trees of certain varieties were more hardy than\r\nthose which had been root-grafted. The objections, if such they can be\r\ncalled, are, that the period of performing the operation is limited,\r\nand that the young shoots from the buds generally have a curve that\r\nmakes a crook or blemish in the tree when it goes from the\r\nnursery--neither of these objections constitute any real difficulty;\r\non the contrary, the advantages quite over-balance them: as already\r\nsuggested, it is a good plan for double-working certain varieties. The\r\nseason for budding is at the period when the longitudinal growth of\r\nthe stock is nearly completed, and when the wood-forming process is\r\nmost active, so that the bark will part most freely from the wood--in\r\nother words, while the stock is still quite active in its circulation,\r\nbut has, in a measure, made its growth. The scions used must have so\r\nfar completed their growth for the season as to have filled their buds\r\nhandsomely, but yet be so young as to allow the wood to part freely\r\nfrom the bark of the shields when they are cut. Those who desire to\r\nbud early, may accelerate the development of the buds by nipping off\r\nthe points of the shoots to be used, this, in a few days, causes the\r\nbuds to swell. The season of budding will thus depend upon the high\r\nculture of the nursery, and upon the condition of the trees from which\r\nthe scions of buds are to be cut. Budding should never be done unless\r\nthe stock is in perfectly good condition, if otherwise, it is labor\r\nlost. The old writers recommended damp, cloudy, or even showery\r\nweather; but under our bright summer skies our large establishments\r\nwould never be able to dispose of their work, were they to wait for\r\nsuch suitable weather. Fortunately it is not found necessary to select\r\nsuch a season, but the greatest success attends the budding that is\r\ndone in fine bright and even hot weather. The scions should be kept\r\nwrapped in a damp cloth, excluded from the rapid evaporation to which\r\nthey would be subjected if exposed--this is better than to keep them\r\nin water, which exhausts them by dilution of the sap they contain. The\r\nscions should have their leaves removed, so soon as they are cut from\r\nthe tree; this is done with a knife or the thumb nail, leaving a short\r\npiece of the leaf-stalk for convenience when inserting the buds.\r\n\r\nSpring budding is sometimes desirable, either to fill up gaps in the\r\nnursery-rows, or to secure varieties, the scions of which may have\r\nbeen received too late for grafting, or when it is desirable to\r\nmultiply them as much as possible, by making every bud grow. When the\r\noperation is to be performed in the spring, the scions must be kept\r\nback, by placing them in the ice-house until the stocks are in full\r\nleaf, when the bark will peel readily, and the buds may be inserted\r\nwith a pretty fair prospect of success; of course, the American method\r\nmust be used in this case, as the wood and bark of the dormant scion\r\nwill not separate.\r\n\r\nThe stocks should be cut down as early in the spring as the buds begin\r\nto swell, with a sharp knife, applied just above the bud, and on the\r\nsame side; the whole upper portion of the stock must be removed by a\r\nclean cut; this is better than to leave a stump of three or four\r\ninches, as is often recommended, as a support to which to tie up the\r\nbuds in their tender growth. All shoots from the stock should be\r\nrubbed out while young; this may need repeating a second time.\r\n\r\nIf the stocks were strong, the buds will make handsome sturdy trees\r\nthe first season; the branched form may be assisted by pinching the\r\npoints when a few inches high, as recommended with the grafts. Two\r\nyear old stocks should make pretty trees, at one year old from the\r\nbud.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION.--SECT. IV.--THE NURSERY.\r\n\r\n  APOLOGY. NURSERYMEN NEED NOT BE JEALOUS. SITE AND SOIL.

From my\r\nfriends in the craft, the many intelligent men and keen observers, who\r\nhave ever been foremost in the ranks of our country's pomologists, no\r\ncensure is apprehended for attempting to dash off a few brief\r\ndirections for the amateur, or even the nurseryman, who is just\r\nbeginning to pursue as a business the pleasant occupation of growing\r\ntrees. Any censure from others, if such there be, who would feel\r\nafraid to trust their knowledge to the world, and who might think in\r\nthis enlightened age that such a thing as secrets of the trade could\r\nbe long retained in their own hands,--any censure, from such a source,\r\nwould fall harmless--it is not dreaded. Indeed, though not of the\r\ntrade, it would be easy to expose the ignorance that is sure to be\r\nfound among those who might claim to be the exclusive conservators of\r\nknowledge, such however is not the object in view, it is rather to\r\nextend useful knowledge, to popularize it and to bring it within the\r\nreach of those who may need it, that this chapter is undertaken; and\r\nthe labor is the more willingly entered upon, in the firm conviction\r\nthat the more the knowledge of plants and the love for them is\r\ndiffused among the masses of our population, the greater will be the\r\nsuccess of those who are engaged as professional nurserymen and\r\ngardeners, who need not fear the competition of amateurs, but should\r\nrather encourage it, upon the score of such persons being and\r\ncontinuing to be their best customers--if not from any higher and more\r\nnoble sentiments of affiliation with men of congenial tastes and\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSITE AND SOIL FOR THE NURSERY.--A somewhat elevated position should be\r\nselected for the ground that is to be appropriated for the production\r\nof trees; the surface water should be able to escape rapidly, instead\r\nof standing in the paths, and furrows, and trenches. The fresh air\r\nshould be able to blow freely over the young trees, swaying them\r\nabout, trying their fibres, and at the same time giving them new\r\nstrength and vigor: not that they should be too much exposed to the\r\nrude blasts, as they might be upon the vast savannas of the West,\r\nwhere a protecting belt of deciduous and evergreen trees, to a\r\nmoderate extent, will be found of service, and conducive to the\r\nhealthy development of young trees in the nursery. But even the naked\r\nprairie, exposed for miles in every direction, would offer a better\r\nlocation for the nursery, than a few acres cleared out among the heavy\r\ntimber. Here the little trees, if crowded together, must be drawn up\r\nto meet the light, and will be poorly furnished with lateral branches,\r\nand unprepared to meet the rude battle with the elements that awaits\r\nthem in their future orchard homes, which, indeed, too often become\r\nrather their graves, into which they are thrust, buried, not planted,\r\nand whence they rise no more, but after a fruitless struggle, dwindle\r\nand die.\r\n\r\nA somewhat elevated situation is also valuable, on account of its\r\ngreater probable immunity from frost, than a lower level; and this is\r\noften a matter of great importance in the successful cultivation of\r\nfruit trees.\r\n\r\nThe soil should be a good strong sandy loam, one that contains the\r\nneedful elements for the growth of trees, and at the same time has a\r\ncomposition that will freely permit the passage of water through it,\r\nand be easily worked by the cultivator. Heavy soils, abounding in\r\nclay, are strong; but they are more retentive of water, they require\r\nmore labor to keep them in a friable condition, and they are sometimes\r\nobjectionable on account of the character of the roots produced in\r\nthem. These are less abundantly furnished with fibres, as a general\r\nrule, when the tree has been grown in a stiff clay, than when it has\r\nbeen produced in a lighter and more porous soil. Mucky soils are too\r\nlight, and should not be used for permanent nurseries, though valuable\r\nfor seedlings, cuttings, and newly transplanted forest evergreens for\r\na short period; unless the muck be underlaid by clay, and that it is\r\nnear enough to the surface to be reached in the preparation of the\r\nsoil, and to become mixed with its staple in cultivating it. Trees,\r\nfor the orchard, should never be grown upon a mucky or peaty soil.\r\n\r\nThe different character of the roots formed by trees growing in\r\nparticular soils, should not be overlooked by the propagator, since\r\nmuch of his reputation as a nurseryman, and the success attendant upon\r\nthe labors of his customers, will depend upon the healthy development\r\nof these important organs, which have been called the mouths of\r\nplants. As elsewhere observed, peaty and mucky soils do not produce\r\nroots of a character well adapted to transplanting into upland soil.\r\nVery stiff clays furnish trees with long straggling roots that have\r\nfeeble and scattered fibres; such roots do not present themselves in a\r\ngood condition, nor are they easily separated from the soil, the\r\ntenacity of which often injures the slender fibrous portions, which\r\nit is desirable to preserve in transplanting. Sandy soils and sandy\r\nloams produce the very best roots, most evenly distributed, and also\r\nmost easily preserved and removed when the trees are dug from the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nMuch may be done by the intelligent cultivator, in any kind of land,\r\nto make good roots by proper treatment of his soil and trees. A\r\nthorough preparation of the ground, and disintegration of the soil,\r\nwill conduce to this result; and thorough culture will maintain the\r\ngood condition thus produced. Frequent transplanting will encourage\r\nthe production of new roots from the cut ends of those that were\r\nruptured in digging, and these will be within reach at the next\r\nremoval. When taking up young trees, or when setting out seedlings in\r\nthe nursery rows, the tap roots, and indeed all long straggling roots,\r\nshould be cut back, with a view to producing the same result. When\r\ntrees have remained for three or four years in the nursery rows, the\r\nfibres will have extended so far in search of food and moisture, that\r\nin digging them, the best portions of the roots will be left in the\r\nground, and the young trees will suffer upon being transplanted in\r\nthis mutilated condition. Such should be root pruned the season\r\nprevious to their removal. This process is performed by removing the\r\nearth on either side of the row, until the roots are exposed, when\r\nthey are cut off at from ten inches to a foot, from the tree, and the\r\nearth replaced upon them, the object being the formation of new fibres\r\nthat shall be within the reach of the spade when they come to be dug\r\nfor the orchard. Another plan for root pruning is, to use a very sharp\r\nspade, which is set down and pressed deeply into the ground, a few\r\ninches from the tree, so as to cut all roots that pass that limit.\r\nThis, though a ruder method, is followed by good results.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGGING THE TREES, is a process that should be conducted upon very\r\ndifferent principles from those exercised in grubbing a thicket. The\r\nnurseryman wishes to clear his block, but the purchaser hopes to save\r\nhis trees, and to have them live, he wants a good share of their roots\r\nwith them. No one need expect, however, to have anything like a large\r\nproportion of the roots of a tree removed from the ground; that is out\r\nof the question, unless they have been grown in walled stations,\r\nconfining the roots, like those of green-house plants in their\r\nflowerpots. In open culture, they will have spread through the soil in\r\nevery direction, and cannot be preserved and removed. Repeated root\r\npruning will be of the greatest service in furnishing a great many\r\nfine roots within reach; but at the best, a great deal of damage is\r\nnecessarily inflicted upon the roots by digging, and the older and\r\nlarger the tree, the greater will be the injury, and the smaller the\r\nproportion of roots to the branches.\r\n\r\nIn digging trees, it is important to remove the soil very carefully on\r\neach side of the row to expose the roots, always holding the spade in\r\nsuch a position that its side and edge shall be in the direction of a\r\nradius, from the stem of the tree as a centre. Never stand facing the\r\ntree to be dug, but keep it next the elbow, at one side. On finding a\r\nroot, withdraw the spade, and try again; and, having ascertained its\r\ndirection, endeavor to loosen the outer extremities first. Proceed all\r\naround in this manner, and by gently swaying the trunk, the points of\r\nresistance will be indicated; these should be loosened and freed\r\nuntil all appear to be free, when, by grasping the collar as low down\r\nas possible, the tree is to be lifted gently and freed from the soil;\r\nno force should be used beyond that which is absolutely necessary, to\r\nlift the plant from its bed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--HARKNESS' TREE DIGGER.]\r\n\r\nIn the great commercial nurseries, all this care cannot be exercised;\r\neverything must be done in the large way, and labor-saving appliances,\r\nthe valuable results of human thought, but still not thinking nor\r\nobserving intelligences, must be used. One of this class is the\r\ntree-digger, which, in the prairie soils, is used with very good\r\nsuccess. It consists of a very large deep plow, without any\r\nmold-board, but with a wide sharp steel share, which is turned up at\r\nthe edges, so as to cut the lateral roots at some distance from the\r\ntrees. It is drawn on each side of the row, by four horses, hitched\r\n_ad tandem_. The trees may then easily be lifted from the loose\r\nprairie soil. The accompanying engraving shows the tree digger of Mr.\r\nE. Harkness, which is much used in the nurseries of Illinois and other\r\nWestern States. The figure is sufficiently clear, without much\r\nexplanation. The broad steel blade runs under the rows and is drawn by\r\nfour horses, two working one before the other, or _tandem_, each side\r\nof the row. Some of our Western nurserymen find great advantage from\r\nthe use of this digger in their free soils, and also for root pruning\r\ntrees that are to remain in the rows.\r\n\r\nIn the sandy loams of New Jersey, a similar tool is used for digging\r\npeach trees, which is drawn by a span of heavy horses that are\r\nattached to the two separate beams, one being on each side of the\r\ntrees. This implement is found to be entirely satisfactory in its\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nHigh manuring in the nursery has been objected to by some orchard\r\nplanters, who say that trees, which have been forced into a too\r\nluxuriant growth in their infancy, receive so severe a shock upon\r\nbeing transplanted to the open field, that they never recover. With\r\nthe neglect which is so commonly accorded to young trees in the\r\norchard, it is really wonderful how they ever survive at all, whether\r\nthey had been stimulated in their culture or not. The large majority\r\nof purchasers at the nursery always select those trees which are most\r\nvigorous, notwithstanding the prejudice against stimulating the trees,\r\nand then with mutilated roots, they probably omit cutting back the\r\nlimbs sufficiently, and when their neglected orchard fails, they\r\ncomplain of the forced trees. The change from the good cultivation of\r\nthe nursery to the careless culture and even neglect of the farm, is\r\ncertainly hard for the poor things to bear. Late growth, encouraged by\r\nhigh manuring, is injurious. There is a much more serious fault of the\r\nnursery than stimulating with manure and high cultivation, and that is\r\nthe too common error of crowding the trees; but even this has its\r\norigin partly with the purchaser, who too often wishes to have his\r\ntrees drawn up as high as possible; instead of demanding low heads he\r\nasks for high ones, and will sometimes offer a premium for trees that\r\nhave grown in one season, the second from the root graft, eight or ten\r\nfeet in a single shoot, so that he may at once calculate upon forming\r\nthe head where he wants it, out of the reach of his horse; a\r\ncalculation, however, which he will not realize.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION OF THE SOIL for a nursery should be as deep and as\r\nthorough as possible, for some things it is best even to trench the\r\nground; but generally, the thorough plowing, with a deep-tiller, or a\r\ntrench-plow, will be sufficient, and if followed by the subsoil\r\nlifter, so much the better. One of the most intelligent\r\nhorticulturists, and most successful nurserymen in the country, finds\r\nthat he can produce a better result in depth and fineness of tilth, by\r\nusing the Double Michigan plow, than he can with the spade. A piece of\r\nclover-sod thus plowed in the fall, and subsoiled at the same time,\r\nwill be in fine order for nursery purposes, after a thorough\r\ncross-plowing and harrowing in the following spring. If the land has\r\nbeen under-drained, so much the better. There is little good land that\r\nwould not be much improved for nursery purposes by tile draining.\r\n\r\nIf manure is to be applied, it may be spread upon the clover-sod\r\nbefore plowing, or it may be thrown upon the plowed ground at once or\r\nat any time during the winter, to be worked into the soil by the\r\nspring plowing; if composted, it may be spread just before the spring\r\nstirring.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING OUT.--In laying out the nursery, some taste may be exercised\r\nby the planter; the sections and blocks should be distinct, and alleys\r\nshould be located at convenient distances, so that all parts may be\r\neasily accessible with the wagon. The rows should be laid out\r\nstraight, and they ought to be far enough apart--four feet might be a\r\ngood average for nursery trees; cuttings and seedlings may, of course,\r\nbe nearer. The trees should not be set too closely in the rows, one\r\nfoot apart is plenty close enough for most kinds, and that is little\r\nenough room for the development of good lateral branches, or for those\r\nwhich have to remain three or four years before transplanting. For\r\npeaches, for dwarf pears, and indeed for any of the varieties that are\r\nto be taken from the nursery as maiden trees, a less space may be\r\nallowed--say eight inches apart. Apple stocks for budding, or for\r\ncollar grafting, may be set ten inches apart, and they will have room\r\nto make very good plants, even should they remain until two years old.\r\n\r\nMost nurserymen set out their apple grafts in the rows where they are\r\nto be grown to full size, and cultivate them from two to three years;\r\nwhile this saves the trouble of transplanting, the trees will not be\r\nas well assorted for size, nor will they have the benefit of the\r\ntransplanting, (which will enhance their value much more than it\r\ncosts, in the improved character of their roots), as have those that\r\nhave been treated on the bedding plan, practiced by some nurserymen.\r\nThis consists in setting the root grafts closely together, in a bed of\r\nvery well prepared ground; they are covered at once with a good\r\nmulching of sawdust, which keeps the ground moist, and insures the\r\ngrowth of almost all the plants, while for the first season they\r\noccupy very little space, and are readily kept clean, as the mulching\r\nprevents the growth of weeds. In the fall, or in the following spring,\r\nthey are taken up, assorted for size, and re-planted in the\r\nnursery-rows where they are to stand. This transplanting improves the\r\ncharacter of their roots, which are more fibrous and shorter than in\r\nthose trees which have stood three or four years without being\r\ndisturbed. Purchasers, now-a-days, begin to look at the roots of their\r\ntrees, as well as the tops; and it may become necessary for the\r\nnurserymen to gratify this fancy for low-headed, stocky trees, that\r\nhave abundant fibres to insure their growth, and their early\r\nfruitfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURE of the nursery should be thorough; the soil should be\r\nfrequently stirred, and kept mellow and loose, to insure cleanliness\r\nand thriftiness, and to make handsome trees. The mellow soil upon the\r\nsurface, is, by some persons, considered equal to a good mulching, and\r\nindeed it answers the indications of one. Cultivation, to kill the\r\nweeds as fast as they appear, will admit both air and moisture; a\r\nshare of both of these is retained by the mellow earth, which, thus\r\ntreated, is indeed a very good mulch. The cultivation may be done with\r\nthe small turning plow, with the double shovel, or with any of the\r\nmany approved cultivators in use everywhere throughout the country.\r\nThe surface should be kept as level and even as possible. In some\r\nsoils the roller, made short enough to pass between the rows, is\r\nhighly esteemed, and is considered a most valuable implement in the\r\nnursery. As a general rule, cultivation should not be continued too\r\nlate in the season, but should be suspended about mid-summer, so as to\r\nprevent a late growth and to encourage the plants to finish their\r\nsummer's work in time to ripen their wood thoroughly before the advent\r\nof winter. This is particularly necessary where the climate is severe,\r\nespecially on new lands, where the trees are very vigorous. Upon the\r\napproach of winter, it is a good practice to plow a light furrow\r\nagainst the trees on each side; this protects the collar from cold,\r\nprevents heaving by the frost, and gives a good surface drainage to\r\nexcess of water.\r\n\r\nFor deeply loosening the ground between the rows, the one-horse\r\nsubsoil lifting plow is a very valuable instrument; this can be used\r\nin very narrow spaces. This plow prepares the ground admirably for the\r\npronged hoe, and it may be used between rows of cuttings and\r\nseedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRONGED HOE.--One of the most valuable implements in the nursery\r\nto clean out the weeds from between the trees, and also to work among\r\ncuttings, and other plants, that are set too closely for the use of\r\nthe horse, is the pronged hoe; it makes the best shallow culture,\r\nprevents the soil from becoming hard, and it is the best destroyer of\r\nsmall weeds that can be used. The flat hoe is never sharp enough to\r\ncut all of the weeds effectually, it produces little tilth, and the\r\nresult of its use is too often a disappointment, but half killing the\r\nweeds, in some places, and dragging them out by the roots in others,\r\nand often leaving the ground hard and in miserable condition.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--THE PRONGED HOE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING CUTTINGS.--Some of the small fruits, as currants,\r\ngooseberries, as well as the quince, are propagated, to a great\r\nextent, by cuttings. The ground for growing them, should be very well\r\nprepared by trenching or trench-plowing; the difference in the growth\r\nbetween cuttings set on well or on poorly prepared ground is\r\nastonishing, and the advantage in favor of trenched land is sufficient\r\nto pay for the extra expense bestowed upon the preparation. The soil\r\nshould be rather sandy, decidedly loose and mellow, and rather moist\r\nthan dry.\r\n\r\nIn setting the cuttings, the rows may be quite close, as horse labor\r\nis seldom employed among them; but they are tended by hand, or the\r\nground is mulched. They may also be set quite thickly in the row, as\r\nthey are to remain but a short time in the cutting bed, from which\r\nthey are transplanted at one year old, though sometimes alternate rows\r\nmay be left over another season. When the trench is opened for them,\r\nthe cuttings are set, three or four inches apart, next the line, so\r\nthat only the top bud shall reach the surface; a little mellow soil is\r\nthrown upon them, and they are tramped firmly at the base, when the\r\nremainder of the earth is thrown in and the next trench is opened for\r\nanother row. If they be planted in the autumn, it is well to cover\r\nthem with a mulch, and for this leaves from the forest are an\r\nexcellent material. Some propagators insist very strongly upon the\r\nnecessity for removing all the buds from the lower portion of the\r\ncutting, particularly in the currant and gooseberry, so as to prevent\r\nsuckering and to grow the bush as a miniature tree, with a single\r\nstem. This is not desirable when the bushes are liable to have the\r\nstems destroyed by the currant borer. Indeed, the nature of the\r\ncurrant appears to require a renewal of the wood by these shoots,\r\nwhich come to replace the old exhausted branches.\r\n\r\nThe grape is grown in immense quantities from cuttings, which are\r\neither planted in a nursery, or set at once in the vineyard. In the\r\nformer they are planted closely in rows, that are about twenty inches\r\napart. Sometimes the ground is trenched, and the cuttings set at the\r\nsame operation. When the first trench is opened in a rich mellow loam,\r\nwhich may be sod or clover lea, the edge of the dug soil is dressed to\r\nthe line with the spade, then the cuttings are placed so as to have\r\none eye at or above the surface, and soil is thrown in and tramped\r\nclosely to the base of the cuttings. Then the next trench is made with\r\nthe spade, digging the ground as you proceed.\r\n\r\nGrape cuttings are generally made eighteen or twenty inches long; and\r\nthose which have a heel of old wood are preferred, and command a\r\nhigher price. The earlier these are taken from the vines, after the\r\nfall of the leaves, the better success will attend the plantation;\r\nprovided they are not too long exposed to the air. Fall planting is\r\nvery desirable, but if not then planted, the cuttings should be put\r\ninto the ground and covered as soon as convenient, and they will be\r\nbetter prepared for spring planting. A deep trench is opened, into\r\nwhich the bundles are set in a vertical position, and loose earth\r\nfilled in about them, and slightly covered over them; they will then\r\nbe ready for planting by the spring. The length of the cuttings has\r\nlatterly been much reduced, with advantage; some of the most\r\nsuccessful planters make them from six to eight inches long: these are\r\nmuch more easily dug than the longer slips, and are better provided\r\nwith roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIMMING should be practiced in the nursery with a definite object in\r\nview, and not at random; much less with any expectation of increasing\r\nthe hight of the trees by trimming them up. The object in pruning\r\nnursery trees should be to develop them in every part, to produce a\r\nstout stocky sturdy little tree, one that may be turned out upon the\r\nbleak prairie, and be able to withstand the blasts. To produce this\r\nresult, the leaves should never be stripped from the shoots to make\r\nthem extend their growth, for the sake of making more leaves; the\r\nnurseryman should know the value of leaves, as constituting the great\r\nevaporating surface that plays a most important part in causing the\r\nascent of the crude sap, and also in its elaboration after it has been\r\ntaken up into the organization of the plant. Leaves should be\r\ncarefully preserved, and in the trimming, which is necessary, this\r\nshould be borne in mind. To make vigorous, stocky trees, the side\r\nbranches should be encouraged rather than pruned off. The tops may\r\nsometimes need to be pinched, to force out the laterals, and to\r\nencourage their growth; if two shoots start together as rivals, one of\r\nthem should be topped or cut back, or twisted and broken, but not cut\r\noff at its origin, unless there be plenty of lateral branches or twigs\r\nto furnish the tree. When these become too long, they may be\r\nspurred-in, either in the fall and winter when cutting grafts, or in\r\nthe summer, during the growing season. Whenever it becomes necessary\r\nto trim off any of these laterals, it is best to do it at mid-summer,\r\nas the healing of the wounds made at this period is very rapid.\r\nHeading off the nursery trees is done to force them to branch out\r\nuniformly the second year, to form their heads at the right place;\r\nthis is to be done toward spring, and is applicable especially to\r\nthose varieties that are prone to make a single shoot the first year\r\nwithout branching, and which have not been pinched-in or headed during\r\nthe previous summer to force out side branches. Cherries, plums, and\r\npears, and some apples, are very apt to make this kind of growth. It\r\nshould have been premised that all nursery trees ought to be grown to\r\none main stem, or leader, from which all the branches arise, and to\r\nwhich they should all be made to contribute their quota of woody\r\nfibre. It has been asserted that the wood of a tree, instead of being\r\na cone, as its stem appears to be and is, it should be a column of\r\nnearly equal size from the bottom to the top; that is, the mass of all\r\nthe branches taken together, should equal the diameter of the trunk at\r\nany point below. A well-grown stocky nursery tree, with its abundance\r\nof lateral branches approximates this idea; but the main stem of such\r\nan one is very perceptibly a cone, rapidly diminishing in diameter\r\nfrom the collar upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE OF TREES FOR PLANTING.--This depends so much upon the views of\r\nplanters, that the nurseryman cannot always control the period at\r\nwhich he shall clear a block of trees. Peaches should always be\r\nremoved at one year from the bud. Plums and dwarf pears will be ready\r\nto go off at two years from the bud or graft; so with apples and\r\ncherries. But many persons, purchasers and sellers, prefer larger\r\ntrees, and they recommend that the trees should remain one, two, or\r\neven three years longer in the nursery. Others, a new school of\r\nplanters, prefer to set out the maiden tree, in most of the species\r\nabove named, except some very feebly growing varieties, that will\r\nscarcely have attained sufficient size to risk in the orchard. The\r\nnurseryman should beware of keeping his trees too long on his hands;\r\nthey may become unprofitable stock, and are sure to require much more\r\nlabor in the digging and handling. The purchaser is his own master,\r\nand his tastes and wishes must be consulted; if he wants large trees,\r\nby all means, let him be indulged; he will have to pay in proportion,\r\nhe will have more wood for his money, more weight to carry, or more\r\ntransportation to pay for, more labor in planting, and vastly\r\nincreased risk of the life of his trees; but, let him be indulged with\r\nhis five year old trees, while his neighbor, for a smaller sum\r\ninvested, with less freight, less wood, less labor, and infinitely\r\nless risk, will plant his maiden trees, and five years hence will\r\nmarket more fruit.\r\n\r\nThe risk of transplanting large or old trees from the nursery, may be\r\ngreatly diminished, and their value will be vastly enhanced, by\r\njudicious root pruning in the nursery-row. This may be done by\r\ndigging, on either side, on alternate years, and cutting off the\r\nstraggling roots, and particularly those that run deeply; this will be\r\nfollowed by the production of a multitude of fibrous roots that put\r\nthe tree into a good condition for transplanting. In the great\r\nnurseries of the West, there is a peculiar plow, which is used for\r\nroot pruning the nursery rows.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOME NURSERY has been recommended by Mr. Field in his _Pear\r\nCulture_ as a means of enabling the orchardist to amuse himself, and\r\nto grow his trees in such style as he may prefer. He advises to select\r\ntrees \"of two or three years' growth, and prepare a piece of ground\r\nfor the home nursery. For this a rich, deep, dry soil should be\r\nspaded and thoroughly pulverized to the depth of two feet, (trenched).\r\nIn it plant the trees in rows four feet distant, and three feet apart\r\nin the rows. Two hundred trees would thus occupy a space fifty feet\r\nsquare. The roots having been carefully examined, and, as before\r\nmentioned, the laterals pruned to six or eight inches, are spread out\r\nhorizontally, and gently covered with earth. It will be seen that the\r\nlabor of pinching, pruning, and cultivating, will be much less on so\r\nsmall a spot, than when the cultivator is obliged to travel over three\r\nor four acres upon which they are ultimately to be planted.\r\n\r\n\"If at the end of two years it is still desirable to allow them to\r\nremain, a sharp spade should be thrust down around them, at a distance\r\nof fifteen or eighteen inches, in order to cut the long straggling\r\nroots, and thus induce the formation of fibres nearer home. This will\r\nfit them for transplanting at an advanced stage of growth. In this\r\ncase, if at the end of two or three years, they are removed at the\r\nproper season, and with care, they will suffer scarcely any check. By\r\npursuing this plan, they receive better care, grow faster, and are not\r\nliable to damage; and as only the good trees will, in this case, be\r\nset in the fruit grounds, none of those unseemly breaks in the rows,\r\ncaused by the injury or death of a tree, need occur. Where, however,\r\nolder trees, at least once transplanted, cannot be obtained, and it is\r\ndesirable to set out the orchard at once, stout two-year old trees are\r\ndecidedly preferable. Such trees have not stood sufficiently long to\r\nsend their roots beyond a limit whence they can be removed; and with\r\ncareful digging, removal and planting, the purchaser need not fear a\r\nloss of more than two per cent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NURSERY ORCHARD, as practiced by A.R. Whitney, of Lee Co., Ill.,\r\nnow one of the largest orchardists of the country, is well worthy of\r\nimitation by all those nurserymen, who desire also to become\r\nfruit-growers. In laying off the blocks of nursery stock, the\r\nvarieties that are wanted for the orchard, should be planted in such a\r\nmanner, that they shall be in every fourth row, so that the orchard\r\ntrees will stand in rows sixteen to twenty feet apart, according as\r\nthe nursery-rows are four or five feet wide. In cultivating and\r\ntrimming these rows in the nursery, a plant is selected, every twelve\r\nor sixteen feet, which is to remain as the orchard tree when the block\r\nshall be cleared. A good tree is selected, and special care in the\r\npruning is bestowed upon it to secure the desired form, and low\r\nbranches; if necessary, the tree on either side of it is removed, to\r\ngive it room. By the time the block is cleared, these orchard trees\r\nare often in bearing, and while his customers are struggling to save\r\ntheir trees, and nursing them after their transplanting, the\r\nnurseryman will have become an orchardist, and is enjoying his fruits.\r\nThe nursery will have become an orchard--one rather closely planted to\r\nbe sure--but the trees can be dwarfed by root pruning with the plow,\r\nthey shelter one another from the prairie blasts, and when too thick,\r\nalternate trees may be removed to the wood-pile, and thus cheer the\r\nowner on a winter's day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER-KILLING is a serious evil in the nursery, as by it whole rows\r\nand blocks of certain varieties are sometimes destroyed, or very\r\nseriously injured. It has been observed to be most marked in its\r\neffects upon those sorts of trees that make the most vigorous and\r\nsappy growth, and those which continue to grow late in the season.\r\nSuch varieties have very naturally acquired the epithet of _tender_\r\nespecially as orchard trees of the same kinds, even in a bearing\r\nstate, have been similarly affected; in some sections of the country,\r\nthese kinds have been thrown out of cultivation. The bark looks\r\nshriveled and withered, the twigs seem dry when cut, and resist the\r\nknife; when thawed by the fire, or on the return of spring weather,\r\nthe bark seems loose, and the inner bark, instead of being\r\ngreenish-white, becomes brown, and the whole tree looks as though it\r\nwas dead. In old trees, large portions of the bark start from the stem\r\nand large limbs, and hang loosely for awhile and then fall off. The\r\nbuds alone retain their vitality, and upon the return of spring they\r\nsometimes succeed in establishing the necessary connection with the\r\nsoil, and restore the circulation of the sap; the results are the\r\ndeposit of the usual annular layer of woody matter, which encases the\r\ndead portions within, that become like a _sequestrum_ of dead bone in\r\nan animal. The best treatment for the trees that have been\r\nwinter-killed, is to cut them back very severely, in the hope of\r\nproducing a vigorous wood-growth the next season, to repair the\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nA partial winter-killing often affects small nursery trees, especially\r\non low and wet, undrained soils; the plants recover, but for years\r\nthey have a black point in the heart which embraces all of the\r\nwood-growth that was affected--all their wood at the period of the\r\ndisaster. This is enclosed and surrounded by clear, healthy wood; but\r\nsuch trees are not desirable, they are so fragile, as to be easily\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nThe best preventive for winter-killing in the nursery, is to\r\nencourage early ripening of the wood, and to drain the land, is one of\r\nthe best means of producing this effect; another is the cessation of\r\nculture at mid-summer, and the sowing of oats very thick at the last\r\ncultivation, has been practiced, and, it is thought, with excellent\r\neffects. The rank growth absorbs the superfluous moisture, robbing the\r\ntrees, and afterwards forms a good protective mulch during the winter.\r\nThe objections to it are, that it encourages the mice, which, by\r\ngirdling the trees, effectually winter-kills them.\r\n\r\nMany nursery and orchard trees often present a black discoloration of\r\nthe bark, which is quite unsightly, and excites alarm for the health\r\nof the tree. This is often caused by trimming at unfavorable periods;\r\nin the spring pruning of bearing trees, the large stumps sometimes\r\nbleed, but in the nursery trees it arises from cutting them, and\r\nespecially in the barbarous trimming up, during severely cold weather,\r\nwhen they are frozen.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIOUS ANIMALS AND INSECTS.--The nurseryman sometimes suffers from\r\nthe depredations of some of the smaller animals, which cause him great\r\nannoyance. The mole, though highly recommended by the naturalists as a\r\nharmless beast, who is an aid to horticulture by his insectivorous\r\nhabits, is nevertheless injurious in his _ways_; for he often makes\r\nhis run in the seed bed, or along a row of root grafts, and raising\r\nthem from their stations break their tender rootlets, when the sun and\r\nair soon destroy them. Mice, of different kinds, are still more\r\ndestructive, particularly in the winter, when they will often girdle\r\nyoung trees near the collar, and do much mischief. They also devour\r\nmany seeds after they have been committed to the ground, particularly\r\nthose sown in the autumn. For both of these animals, the best\r\npreventive is to catch them, which may be done with traps. They may\r\nalso be poisoned. The young trees may be protected from the mice by\r\nkeeping them clear of rubbish, that would shelter these animals, and\r\nwhen snow falls, it should be trodden down closely about the trees.\r\nOwls and cats will do their share in the destruction also, but they\r\nwill also take the friendly little birds.\r\n\r\nRabbits are also very apt to bite off young shoots, and to bark trees\r\nof larger growth in the nursery, as well as those that have been set\r\nout in the orchard. Various methods have been suggested to prevent\r\ntheir injuries. Wrapping the stems with strips of rags or with ropes\r\nof hay, was formerly the method practiced by those who wished to save\r\ntheir young trees; the process is tedious and troublesome. A few\r\npieces of corn-stalk have been placed by the stem of the tree and tied\r\nto it; this, too, is a troublesome procedure, though, like the others,\r\nit is efficacious. A still better plan in this class of preventives,\r\nis a half sheet of common brown wrapping paper, made to encircle the\r\nstem, like an inverted funnel; this need be fastened only at the top,\r\nby a little thin grafting wax applied with a brush at the instant, or\r\nthe paper may be tied with some common white cotton string. This\r\nenvelope keeps off the rabbits, and lasts through the winter; the\r\nstring will decay before the growing season returns, so there is no\r\ndanger of strangulation. All the other wrappings must be removed, or\r\nthey will injure the trees and afford harbor for insects. It will be\r\nobserved that all applications of this class, are adapted only to\r\ntrees that have a clean hole without branches, but are not suited for\r\nthose which are made to branch at or near the ground. Besides, in\r\ncountries where snow abounds, these little marauders are elevated\r\nabove the wrappings, and have fair play at the unprotected parts of\r\nthe tree--on this account another class of preventives has been\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThese consist in applications that are obnoxious to rabbits, which,\r\nbeing nice feeders, are easily disgusted. White-wash, and white-wash\r\nmade with tobacco water, soap, whale-oil soap, grease, blood, and\r\nespecially the dead rabbit itself, freshly killed, have all been used\r\nwith happy results, in that they have driven these animals to seek\r\ntheir food elsewhere. A very good application, and one that may be\r\nused upon a low-branched tree as well as to the smooth clear stem of\r\none that is higher, is blood. This is put on with a swab; a few corn\r\nhusks tied to a stick, answers very well. Dipping this into the vessel\r\nof blood, the swab is struck gently against the stem or the branches,\r\nas the case may be, and the fluid is spattered over it. A very little\r\nwill answer to keep the rabbits away, and the effect will continue all\r\nwinter, notwithstanding the rains.\r\n\r\nCertain insects also prove injurious in the nursery, among these the\r\nmost numerous are the _aphides_, which are found upon the roots of\r\nsome fruit trees, especially the apple. Others of this disagreeable\r\ninsect appear upon the foliage, among these one of the most disgusting\r\nis the one which causes the black curl, on young cherry trees. The\r\npear tree slug, (_Selandria cerasi_), destroys the foliage of many\r\nyoung trees in the nursery; caterpillars also do their share of\r\nmischief. A serious trouble in old nursery grounds, especially where\r\nmanure is used, is the grub of the May beetles, of which there are\r\nseveral species. These grubs are whitish, nearly as thick as the\r\nlittle finger, with a brownish head. They cut off the young nursery\r\ntrees at three or four inches below the surface. We have seen two-year\r\nold stocks cut in this manner, and the work of destruction was so\r\ncomplete, that the proprietor of the nursery was a long time in\r\nattributing it to such an apparently inadequate cause as this\r\nsluggish, soft-bodied grub. All of these, with other insects injurious\r\nto fruit, will be considered in their appropriate place.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] The Plant, a Biography: M.J.

ROOT-PRUNING\r\n    PLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nDwarfing consists in so controlling the growth of plants as to reduce\r\nthe natural size of any of our fruit trees, and bring them within\r\ncomparatively narrow bounds. The objects of dwarfing are to enable us\r\nto plant a large number of specimen trees, or of varieties upon a\r\nsmall piece of ground, or to have small trees beside the alleys of our\r\ngardens. Such plants are also well adapted for growing in pots, or in\r\nthe borders of an orchard-house. It is claimed for dwarfed trees, that\r\nthey are more prolific than those which are worked on free stocks,\r\nwhich are often erroneously called standards, and it is also asserted\r\nthat these dwarfed trees will bear sooner and produce finer and larger\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe terms used may as well be explained at once. When we speak of\r\ndwarfing stocks, we mean such as are so uncongenial as to check the\r\nwood-growth; and thus, while producing smaller trees, they have a\r\ntendency to early fruitfulness if properly managed. But this condition\r\nmay be superinduced by other means than these. Hence in speaking of\r\ndwarf pear trees, it does not follow that they have been worked on the\r\nquince or other uncongenial stock. A dwarf tree, of whatever kind, is\r\nsimply one that has been caused to assume diminutive proportions.\r\nDwarfing stocks are contrasted with free stocks, or those which would\r\nhave attained the full size of the species, and which, when grafted,\r\nproduce large trees. These are often mis-called standards, when\r\ncontrasted with those that have been worked on the quince, or other\r\ndwarfing stock. Whereas, the trees propagated on free stocks, may also\r\nbe dwarfed, by means that will be presently detailed; and the term\r\nstandard refers really to the mode in which the training of the\r\nspecimens has been performed. Those which are trimmed up as orchard\r\ntrees are usually treated as standards, and are said to be trimmed to\r\nstandard hight. Those branching at a lower point are called half\r\nstandards. Those which are branched so low as to conceal the stem of\r\nthe tree, and in which the limbs are so well managed that the lower\r\nones are always the longest, and those above them gradually contracted\r\nto the point at the top, are called pyramids, or more properly conical\r\ntrees. Whether dwarfed or not, trees may be trained in a variety of\r\nforms, such as the columnar, sometimes called the _quenouille_; the\r\nvase or goblet form may be given them, or the parasol shape, and they\r\nmay be made to assume the form of a fan or other mode of extension\r\nlaterally, when trained upon a wall or espalier frame, as may be seen\r\nin the illustrations given by Du Breuil; but it is seldom that our\r\ngardeners are willing to bestow the care and attention necessary to\r\nproduce these results.\r\n\r\nThe vertical and oblique _cordons_ represented and recommended by Du\r\nBreuil are very attractive, and admirable methods of training and\r\ndwarfing fruit trees, and of crowding a great many into a small space.\r\nHis method of making an edging to the fruit-border with dwarf apples,\r\ninarched together so as to form a connected tree for its whole length,\r\nis a capital illustration of the control we may exercise upon\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nStandards and pyramids are often trained as weeping trees, for the\r\nsake of gratifying the fancy of the cultivator, and with a view of\r\nbringing on that early productiveness which results from the check of\r\nthe upward current of sap that is incident to such a mode of\r\ntreatment. This is really a kind of dwarfing so far as it goes, and if\r\ncommenced early in the life of the tree, it may become very effective,\r\nespecially when combined with other means of reducing the growth.\r\nThese are formed by arching the branches, tying their tips to a ring\r\nof wire or hoop secured near the ground, or simply by fastening\r\nweights to them sufficient to keep them in the desired position, and\r\nby tying the upper limbs to the lower ones. As is well known, the sap\r\nflows most readily toward the shoots that occupy a vertical line; it\r\nwill be seen that its ascent will be seriously retarded in those that\r\nare bent, and their vigor will be diminished, and fruit-bearing will\r\nbe promoted. This process must not be continued too perseveringly,\r\nlest the tree become exhausted by over-production.\r\n\r\nDu Breuil recommends laying bare the principal roots of the tree in\r\nthe spring of the year, so as to expose them for the most of their\r\nlength, and leaving them in this condition during the summer. This\r\nexposure of roots to the sun and air diminishes the vigor of the tree,\r\nand hence it tends to the production of fruit. He also recommends the\r\nremoval of a part of the roots in the spring, and replacing the earth;\r\nconsidering this a more energetic operation than the preceding, he\r\nadvises caution, lest we injure the tree. This is simply root-pruning,\r\na plan that has been pretty thoroughly tested in this country, where,\r\nperhaps, its beneficial effects are more needed than in any other, and\r\nwhere we shall even find it advantageous to have recourse to\r\nmechanical means for its performance in large orchards by horse-power,\r\nas will be set forth in another place.\r\n\r\nA very successful method of obtaining the desired effect of dwarfing,\r\nwhich is early and abundant fruiting, consists in transplanting the\r\ntrees in the autumn; this should be done very carefully, so as to\r\npreserve the roots from mutilation as much as possible. The effect of\r\nthis will be to check the wood-growth the ensuing summer, and\r\nfruit-buds will be formed, for it is well known that these two\r\nopposite conditions of plant life are complementary the one to the\r\nother, and while we always desire to see them both proceeding together\r\nin a healthy tree, the wood-growth must have been moderated before we\r\ncan expect to receive any fruit.\r\n\r\nThe French and English excel us in training upon walls and espaliers,\r\nand we may willingly yield them the palm; since, in this country, it\r\nis rarely necessary to incur so great expense for the production of\r\ngood fruits, and as a means of dwarfing our trees, it is more\r\nexpensive and requires more skill, care, and watchfulness, than other\r\nmethods of producing this effect. Espalier training, however, affords\r\nthe most beautiful opportunity for the illustration of many of the\r\nimportant principles of vegetable physiology, but it should never be\r\nundertaken by any one who is not familiar with these, and at the same\r\ntime willing to exercise great patience and perseverance in their\r\napplication to the subjects under his control. No blind pursuance of\r\nthe abstract rules of the art can enable the mere routine gardener to\r\nbecome a successful grower of espalier trees. The modes of training\r\nare various, to suit the whims and necessities of the artist. Trees\r\nare fastened directly to the walls, or to trellises of wood or of\r\niron, that are placed at a little distance from the masonry, or they\r\nmay be entirely independent of any such structures, and exposed to the\r\nair and light freely on both sides. The trellises may be either\r\nvertical, or inclined. The limbs may be made to issue nearly opposite\r\nto one another, and be trained horizontally in two directions, with\r\nsuccessive stages to the top of the wall or trellis, or they may be\r\ntrained in a fan shape, with various modifications of what M. Du\r\nBreuil calls the _palmette_ form. And a simple modification of this\r\nmethod of dwarfing may be made with some varieties of fruit, by\r\ntraining a single stem horizontally within a foot of the ground, as a\r\nborder or edging between the path-ways and the cultivated ground.\r\n\r\nThe favorite method of training in France, at the present day, appears\r\nto be that called the _cordon_. This may be either the vertical or\r\ninclined. In this kind of espalier, the trees are dwarfed by crowding\r\nthem closely together, and by successive pinching and other\r\nmutilation, such as bending and even breaking the shoots, which\r\nresults in early productiveness. The trees are planted sixteen inches\r\napart, and are trained to single stems, and so treated as to be\r\nfurnished with the requisite number of fruit-spurs on their whole\r\nextent. This is quite a new application of principles, and one which\r\nis rudely imitated by Mr. Field's pear hedges, which, however, bear\r\nbut little resemblance to the elegant cordons of Du Breuil beyond that\r\nof dwarfing by crowding and pinching. We are told that among the many\r\nadvantages of this method, are the diminished time required to cover a\r\nwall or trellis with fruit, and the greater facility of replacing a\r\ndead or defective tree, which, in the usual espalier methods, is a\r\nvery serious matter, requiring several years for its restoration and\r\nthe production of a crop.\r\n\r\nWe are so blessed, in most parts of this country, with soil and\r\nclimate that are well adapted to the production of fruit in the open\r\nfield, upon sturdy orchard trees, that there is less necessity for\r\nintroducing these elegant methods of pursuing the fine art of\r\nhorticulture; and yet there are reasons in the uncertain climate of\r\nour winters, why these plans of training and dwarfing should be\r\npursued by those who have the talent and the means for doing it. Until\r\nwithin a few years, there were not many dwarfed pear or apple trees in\r\nthis country, and they were confined chiefly to French gardens and to\r\nthe establishments of the wealthy. But since their more general\r\nintroduction, immense numbers have been propagated and planted, and\r\nextensive orchards, particularly of dwarfed pears, have been set out\r\nwith a view to profit. Some of these have been eminently successful,\r\nothers are failures; the results will very much depend upon the amount\r\nof care which may be bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe French have long practiced the dwarfing of certain varieties of\r\nfruits, and have been very successful in their results; but that\r\nwonderful people, the Chinese, excel all others in this branch of\r\nhorticulture, for which they display a remarkable talent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDWARFING BY UNCONGENIAL STOCKS.--The usual mode, which is literally a\r\npartial starvation of the tree by limiting the supplies of crude sap,\r\nconsists in the use of uncongenial and dwarf-growing stocks, upon\r\nwhich the desired varieties are budded or grafted. These are, for the\r\ndwarfed pear, either Quinces, Thorns, the Mountain Ash, or the\r\nAmelanchiers; for the apple, the Paradise and the Doucin varieties of\r\napple stocks; for the peach and plum, the Chickasas, or other dwarf\r\nplum stock may be used. The free-growing cherries are worked on the\r\nMahaleb or the Morello varieties; but it must be confessed, that some\r\nof these do not produce a perfect dwarf without other treatment.\r\n\r\nTo produce a dwarf by grafting on an uncongenial stock, this should be\r\nso uncongenial as to form an imperfect union, which checks the\r\ndownward circulation; the sap that has been elaborated by the organs\r\nof the scion is thus kept above the junction of the two woods, and,\r\nbeing so checked, the result is the early formation of fruit-buds, and\r\na premature fruitage of the trees results in a direct proportion to\r\nthe incompleteness of the union of scion and stock. This is often so\r\nvery imperfect as to be very easily ruptured, the grafts are often\r\nbroken out by a very small force being applied to them, sometimes even\r\nthe weight of the fruit is sufficient to effect a separation, and an\r\nexamination of the rupture will show how very slight or imperfect the\r\nunion between the parts has been; in other cases, however, it is\r\ndifficult to trace the fibres of wood-growth that belong respectively\r\nto the stock and to the scion, even when these have been so different\r\nas pear and quince, or plum and peach.\r\n\r\nIt is also considered desirable that the roots of the stock should be\r\nsmall and fibrous, and not long, naked, and straggling; the former\r\nwill furnish the crude sap in more limited amounts, and are less\r\nlikely to produce an excessively rampant or luxurious growth in the\r\nscion.\r\n\r\nMany persons have been disappointed in the Mahaleb cherry, which has\r\nbeen reputed to be a dwarfing stock. It is found, that without the\r\napplication of other means, the so-called dwarfed cherries grow as\r\nfreely, at least in their early years, as those worked on the free\r\nstock, known as the Mazzard cherry. They will never make such large\r\ntrees, however, and those who would enjoy dwarf cherry trees, should\r\ncombine the different methods of producing the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY PINCHING.--There are other means of producing the desired effects\r\nof dwarfing and early fruiting, which should be mentioned. These\r\nconsist in systematic efforts to curtail the development of the\r\nwood-growth, by judicious pinching, of the tips or points of the\r\nbranches, and to prevent the rambling of the roots by root-pruning.\r\nThese it is designed now to examine. Pinching is practiced in the\r\ngreen-house with the happiest effects, and it results in the\r\nproduction of the most perfect form of the plants, and most abundant\r\ndisplay of flowers. The constant check which is thus given to the wood\r\nsystem, causes the sap to seek new outlets, and instead of the one\r\nlimb into which it had been flowing, and causing it to be developed;\r\nits flow is now directed to the other buds along its course, which\r\npresently burst out into lateral growths, none of which are so strong\r\nas the first, and these are induced to change the character of the\r\nbuds so as to result in the production of flowers and fruit.\r\n\r\nThis system applied to fruit-trees has been most thoroughly carried\r\nout by the French, and is admirably described and illustrated by Du\r\nBreuil, in a work called _Scientific Culture of Fruit Trees_, and\r\nreproduced in our own language by Wm. Wardle, an English gardener and\r\norchardist of high reputation.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that in this country, where fruits are so\r\neasily produced, we shall soon reach such a point of horticultural\r\npractice as to lead us to the adoption of the European system of\r\nwalls and espalier training, but we shall do well to watch the\r\napplication of the very important principles involved in their\r\npractice, since these may be applied to our orchards with manifest\r\nadvantage. In reference to the form and management of trained trees,\r\nit is established as an axiom that their permanency is dependent upon\r\nan equal diffusion of the sap being kept up throughout the whole\r\nextent of their branches. This occurs naturally in all trees, because\r\nthey develop themselves in the forms natural to them, but in our\r\ngardens and orchards we make our trees assume unnatural forms. The sap\r\nflows to the highest parts by a law which is well known, though not so\r\nwell understood; as a consequence, the lower branches do not receive\r\ntheir needed supplies, and being smothered by those above them, they\r\neventually die and decay, leaving a naked stem supporting a top, or\r\nthe common form of the natural tree. To maintain the shape we\r\ndesire--be this the pyramid, the vase, or the espalier of whatever\r\nkind--certain operations must be performed from time to time, as the\r\nconditions of the tree may indicate.\r\n\r\nAmong these, Du Breuil advises to prune the strong branches short and\r\nallow the weaker ones to grow long, and thus to restore the balance.\r\nThis may be done at the spring pruning, and also at any time during\r\nthe growing season, when it may be necessary to check excessive growth\r\nat any one point: and upon this principle depends some of the most\r\nimportant practice of the summer pruning of our vineyards. The sap\r\nflows towards the leaves, and by removing them from one part, and\r\nleaving a preponderance upon another, we change the direction of its\r\nflow. As the strongest flow is toward those parts that are in a\r\nvertical direction, we may also check this tendency, or encourage it,\r\nby altering the position of the branch, as is done in the vineyard by\r\ntying up the canes we wish to have developed, and depressing the\r\nlaterals with their fruit; so in a tree, we may depress the shoots\r\nwhich are too strong, and elevate those that are weak, to produce the\r\ndesired effect. We may also greatly diminish the flow of sap to a\r\nstrong branch by removing early all its useless buds; this is a sort\r\nof premature pinching to be sure, but when we consider the powerful\r\ninfluence exerted by these organs as centers of vitality, we can\r\nrealize their attractive force in drawing the sap towards them. After\r\nthe production of the full number of shoots upon the weaker branch, if\r\nthe foliage continue to predominate upon the stronger shoot, it may be\r\npartially removed by early pinching, or cutting through the petioles,\r\nnot by tearing them off; and as late as possible, remove the surplus\r\nand useless shoots from the weaker branches, which were at first\r\nneeded to encourage the flow of sap in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe true pinching of the young laterals, or new shoots, should also be\r\ndone as early as possible to keep them in check on the strong\r\nbranches, while the same operation may be delayed on the weaker, from\r\nwhich we should remove only those that will be supernumeraries. M. Du\r\nBreuil also recommends the stimulation of the weaker limbs, by bathing\r\nall the green portions with a solution of sulphate of iron, made by\r\ndissolving twenty-four grains in a pint of water. This should be\r\napplied in the evening, when it is absorbed by the leaves, and acts as\r\na powerful stimulant.\r\n\r\nIt is a well established principle, that the chief growth by extension\r\nwill be made by the terminal bud, and this should either be removed by\r\ncutting back, or left upon the limb, according as we desire to grow\r\nour wood; if extension of the shoot be our leading object, all the\r\nlateral buds must be subordinated. So also, it is well known, that all\r\ncircumstances, which retard the circulation, are followed by a\r\ndiminution of the wood-growth, and by the development of flower buds.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the strawberry affords one of the best illustrations of\r\nthe benefits and effects of pinching. The runners of this plant may be\r\nviewed in the light of wood-growth, or the increase of the plant by\r\nextension; even though these slender threads are not permanent, and\r\nthey only serve to convey a bud to a distance from the parent plant,\r\nand place it under favorable circumstances for the formation of a\r\nnatural layer. They are but annual productions, and hence there is no\r\nconsiderable deposit of woody matter, as in the limbs of trees, but\r\nthey are thrown out from the parent plant just like woody branches,\r\nand are so much substance withdrawn from it, which, if retained or\r\nthrown back upon the plant, would have resulted in an enlargement of\r\nthe main stem of the strawberry plant, and in the development of buds\r\nupon the crown, which become stored with the proper juices that result\r\nin the production of more abundant blossom buds. The result, however,\r\nis so admirable an illustration of this important element in the\r\nmanagement of permanent and woody fruit-trees, that we may well look\r\nat an herbaceous plant, be it even so humble an individual as the\r\nprostrate earth-berry, as our ancestors called the delicious\r\n_Fragaria_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDWARFING THE APPLE\r\n\r\nApples are generally dwarfed by working them upon the French Paradise\r\nstock, which is a very diminutive tree or bush, seldom rising more\r\nthan a few feet high. This is the true stock for those who wish to\r\nindulge in the luxury of dwarf apple trees. Such are very appropriate\r\nfor the small garden, or for the specimen grounds of a nursery\r\nestablishment, and they sometimes make beautiful objects in the lawn\r\nor among the shrubbery, but they are wholly unsuited for orchard\r\nplanting, as many a poor deluded purchaser has found out to his\r\nsorrow, a few years after having been beguiled by the smooth-spoken\r\ntree peddlers, who have sold many thousands through the country to\r\nfarmers to plant as orchard trees.\r\n\r\nThere is a more vigorous stock which has been used for the same\r\npurpose, but it possesses much less dwarfing power. It is called the\r\nDoucin, or English dwarfing stock. This, however, exerts so little of\r\nthe dwarfing influence, that at the end of eight or ten years the\r\ntrees are generally about as large as those worked upon free stocks;\r\nbut it happens unfortunately that early fruitage, the great object of\r\ndwarfing, is not attained by their use, for they will not have\r\nproduced any more fruit than the common trees similarly treated.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY ROOT PRUNING.--Among the many valuable hints which horticulturists\r\nhave received, with the beautiful flowering and other plants, from our\r\nantipodes in the \"Flowery Land,\" none has been of greater value than\r\nthe practice of root-pruning. In this art of dwarfing even the large\r\nforest trees by mutilations of the roots and by other means, this\r\ncurious people excel all others, as has frequently been stated. In\r\nEurope, and in this country also, root-pruning has been extensively\r\npracticed with the effect of partially dwarfing the trees, but more\r\nespecially with the object of inducing prematurely the fruitfulness we\r\nso much desire, and which is a natural result of the diminished\r\nsupplies of crude sap furnished by the contracted roots of a tree that\r\nhas been treated in this manner. The balance between the wood-growth\r\nby extension, and that which results in fruitful spurs is sooner\r\nestablished, and the sap is directed to the formation and support of\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\nWe should not commence the application of this severe treatment until\r\nour trees have been allowed to establish themselves firmly in their\r\nstations, unless we desire at the same time to produce decided dwarfs\r\nby means of root-pruning. In this case the treatment may be commenced\r\nin the nursery itself; the stocks should be transplanted once or\r\noftener before being worked, and the young trees should be moved\r\nannually, which will so shorten the roots as to make them a mass of\r\nfibres, occupying the whole soil close about their main divisions, and\r\nthe subsequent removals can then be easily effected, with but a slight\r\ncheck to the tree, which becomes furnished with fruit spurs at a very\r\nearly period of its existence, instead of its requiring years to reach\r\nits natural period of fruitfulness, as is the case with some\r\nvarieties, particularly of the pear.\r\n\r\nAs generally practiced, however, root-pruning is postponed until the\r\ntrees have made a free and vigorous growth, and have become well\r\nestablished in their stations. Then if the growth be too vigorous, and\r\nthere do not appear any indications of the formation of fruit spurs,\r\nas is often the case in the fertile soils of the West, our impatient\r\norchardists complain of the barrenness of their trees, and seek a\r\nremedy in root-pruning. This is generally performed with a sharp\r\nspade, with which a trench is dug in a circle around the tree. The\r\nexcavation should be deep enough to reach all of the lateral roots;\r\nthese are generally within a foot of the surface. The ditch need not\r\nbe much wider than the spade, and the soil can be thrown back at once,\r\nbut all the roots should be severed, if we desire to produce the\r\neffect of checking the wood-growth. The diameter of this circle will\r\ndepend upon the size and vigor of the tree to be operated upon. As a\r\ngeneral rule, it may be made in the proportion of one foot to each\r\ninch of the tree's diameter. The work may be done at any time after\r\nthe spring growth has begun to harden, or during the autumn and\r\nwinter, and until the buds are about to break in the spring. The\r\noperation is wonderfully conducive to the end we have in view, and we\r\noften see a vigorously growing but barren subject, transformed in a\r\nsingle season into a fruitful tree, covered with blossom-bearing spurs\r\nthat are full of promise of delicious fruits. In some varieties,\r\nhowever, these fruit spurs require more than a single season for their\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nNow it may be objected that this labor will be expensive, and so it\r\nis, as all hard work with the spade must be; but what of that, when we\r\nconsider the happy results that ensue in golden harvests. But it has\r\nbeen suggested that this labor may be performed by farm machinery,\r\nusing a strong plow, or rather a sharp cutter attached to a plow beam,\r\nand drawn by a powerful team at the requisite distance on either side\r\nof the rows of trees, and in directions crossing each other at right\r\nangles. This, of course, like all mere mechanical applications, must\r\nbe uniform, whether the necessities of the trees be equal or not;\r\nwhereas, by hand-labor, we may vary the distance at which the roots\r\nare to be cut, according to the vigor and size of the trees demanding\r\nthe treatment.\r\n\r\nThis topic will be again referred to in the chapter on Pruning, where\r\nalso it will be necessary to recur to the subject of Training, which\r\nwas incidentally alluded to in connection with Dwarfing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDISEASES.\r\n\r\n  DIFFICULTIES IN THE OUTSET.

THE ROT AND MILDEW OF THE\r\n    GRAPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn opening a discussion upon the nosology of vegetation, it may be\r\nexpected that one who had spent many years of his life in the\r\ninvestigation of the diseases of the human family, and at the same\r\ntime was something of a student of comparative anatomy and physiology,\r\ntracing analogies between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, should be\r\nfamiliar also with the diseases of plants. Such an anticipation, it is\r\nfeared, will not, in the present instance, be realized. Indeed, the\r\nwriter feels very much at a loss how to proceed in discussing this\r\nbranch of the subject, and hardly knows what departures from undoubted\r\nhealth and vigor should be considered worthy of the title of disease.\r\nNor is it easy to trace the causes of the conditions that are\r\ngenerally viewed in the light of maladies. We find the manifestations\r\nboth in the tree or plant, and in its several parts, and also in the\r\nproducts which chiefly interest us; the fruits themselves, are often\r\ndeteriorated by what is called diseased action of different kinds. The\r\nanalogy to diseases of animals is certainly not very distinct. We do\r\nnot find anything like fevers, or gout, or rheumatism, in plants, but\r\nwe may consider some of their conditions somewhat in the light of\r\ndropsies, and plethora or hypertrophy on the one hand, and of anæmia\r\nor atrophy upon the other; we may consider canker and the death of\r\nsome parts of a plant analogous to gangrene, and mortification in the\r\nanimal subject. Then again we find congenital defects in individuals\r\namong plants, just as we do among animals. Some are always less\r\nvigorous than others, and thus certain varieties seem possessed of a\r\ndegree of inherent disease that perpetually prevents them from\r\ndisplaying the requisite strength and vigor which we so much desire in\r\nour plantations. Certain varieties that, from the size and excellence\r\nof their fruits, have attracted the attention of pomologists, are so\r\ndeficient in health and vigor as to be considered diseased, and are\r\ntherefore very properly condemned as unworthy a place in our orchards\r\nand gardens; others appear simply deficient in the production of some\r\none part, as is illustrated by the inferior strength of the woody\r\nfibres of some trees, which break easily under the weight of their own\r\nfruit, and thus destroy the symmetry of the tree and diminish its\r\nproductiveness. Others have defective foliage, which is attended by\r\nthe imperfect performance of the functions of growth, both in the\r\nfruit and in the sustaining woody fibres; others again produce\r\ndefective blossoms with either a redundancy or deficiency of the parts\r\nthat are necessary for the production of the seeds needed for the\r\nperpetuation of the species. When the parts are deficient, the flowers\r\nare called barren or infertile. A redundancy or multiplication of\r\nparts is seen in double flowers of our gardens, where they are much\r\nprized for their beauty, though considered monstrosities by the\r\nbotanist, and perhaps properly referred to diseased action by the\r\nnosologist.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, that very often the conditions of a plant and its\r\nproducts, which we most highly prize, and towards which all our\r\nefforts in its culture are directed, are really departures from the\r\nnatural and healthful status; in other words, what we covet, is really\r\na state of diseased and abnormal action. With the other secondary\r\nobjects of occupying and ornamenting the barren wastes of the earth\r\nwith plants, and thus supplying food to hosts of insects, and to the\r\nhigher animals, nature also has primarily in view, the production of\r\nperfect seeds for the perpetuation of their species, by the plants\r\nthat are profusely scattered over the globe. Man, on the contrary,\r\noften rejects the true seeds as worthless when compared to their\r\njuicy fleshy envelopes that constitute his favorite fruits, or the\r\nenlarged and succulent roots, tubers, stalks, and leaves, that\r\ncharacterize his garden vegetables and field crops; while in the\r\ngrains proper he seeks sustenance in the true seeds, which become the\r\nobject of his greatest care and ingenuity to enlarge, to increase, and\r\nto develop, particularly in regard to their nutritive qualities.\r\n\r\nMost writers upon the diseases of plants have given us very indistinct\r\nnotions upon the subject, and have done very little to enlighten their\r\nreaders; while they have written voluminously upon the unhealthy and\r\nunsatisfactory condition of certain vegetables, and have given us most\r\nextensive accounts of the treatment by which they propose to remedy\r\nthe evils complained of, we gather little of the information needed to\r\nenable us to understand the true state of the case, or of the causes\r\nof the disease, if it is to be considered such. The reader need not\r\nexpect that he will be more enlightened by this chapter than he has\r\nbeen by the essays to which reference is here made, but he will be led\r\nto a consideration of some of the causes of those departures from\r\nhealth and vigor which are considered diseased action, and in this way\r\nhe may possibly be put upon the track which will lead him to the\r\navoidance of disastrous results. More than this will not be attempted.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most satisfactory account of diseases of plants is that\r\ngiven by Lankester, in which he divides them according to their\r\ncauses, as follows:\r\n\r\n1st--Those produced by changes in the external conditions of life,\r\nsuch as redundancy or deficiency of the ingredients of soil, of\r\nlight, of heat, air, and moisture.\r\n\r\n2d--Those produced by poisonous agencies, as by injurious gases,\r\nmiasmata in the air, or by poisons in the soil.\r\n\r\n3d--Those arising from the growth of parasitic plants, such as the\r\nvarious Fungi, Dodder, Mistletoe, etc.\r\n\r\n4th--Such as are caused by mechanical injuries or wounds, and by the\r\nattacks of insects.\r\n\r\nThese may be considered separately: 1st--It may be assumed, and has\r\nbeen already well established by botanists, that every plant has its\r\nown peculiar constitution, adapting it to certain atmospheric\r\nconditions, and that for its healthful and successful culture, these\r\nmust be understood and adhered to, within comparatively narrow limits.\r\nTropical plants, as is well known, cannot be cultivated beyond their\r\nnatural limits, except under circumstances where their natural\r\nconditions are nearly imitated by the gardener; and even in our stoves\r\nand hot-houses, these plants do not compare in vigor with their\r\nfellows that luxuriate in the hot and steaming atmosphere of the\r\ntropics, under the stronger light of such a clime as is natural to\r\nthem. On the contrary, the plants of northern latitudes will not grow\r\nand produce seeds where temperature is too elevated. Those from a\r\nhumid atmosphere suffer in an arid clime, and those which thrive in\r\ndry sandy regions suffer equally when introduced into a humid\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThus we find, that where there is too much moisture for some of our\r\ncultivated plants, they are inclined to be too succulent, and this\r\nvery excess may produce a dropsical condition that is really a state\r\nof disease. Thus we suffer in a loss of fruit, which will fall badly\r\nbefore its period of maturity, and that which remains its full time\r\nis found to be thin and watery, deficient in the high spicy aromatic\r\nflavor which is so highly appreciated by the connoisseur of these\r\nchoice products. When, on the other hand, the arid character of the\r\nsoil and climate prevail to an extent that is uncongenial to any\r\nparticular fruit, we shall find that its growth is arrested, and that\r\nits highest qualities are not adequately developed: this is frequently\r\nobserved in an unusually dry season--and in California, where\r\nirrigation is required to enable the orchardist to produce some of the\r\nsucculent fruits, the most remarkable size and beauty have been\r\nattained, but we are told that it was often at the expense of the\r\ndesired flavor that the same varieties acquire, under circumstances\r\nmore advantageous to the development of their superior qualities.\r\n\r\nSo in many of our fruits, the successful results depend upon the\r\nhygrometric condition of the atmosphere, and Liebig suggests that a\r\nvery prolific source of diseased action in plants, arises from the\r\nsuppressed evaporation and transpiration consequent upon such\r\natmospheric conditions.\r\n\r\nToo much moisture prevailing at the time of the blossoming of our\r\nfruits, especially moisture precipitated in the form of rain during\r\nthis period, is sometimes disastrous to our crops, both of cereals and\r\nof orchard fruits. Continuous showers prevent the development of the\r\npollen-grains, and their transfer to the stigmas of the blossoms, so\r\nthat the fruit does not set well. Fortunately this does not often\r\noccur in our glorious climate, which is so highly favored by an\r\nabundance of light and sunshine, which are the great and essential\r\nstimuli of the higher orders of plants. The loss of our fruit crops\r\nin some parts of the Ohio Valley in the years 1862, 1865, and 1866,\r\nwas fairly attributed to this cause.\r\n\r\nWe must not overlook the unhealthy influences produced by an excess of\r\nmoisture in the earth. Many plants that naturally delight in a dry\r\nporous soil, become weak, unfruitful, or even seriously diseased when\r\nthey are planted in low wet grounds, or upon such as are underlaid by\r\na very tenacious sub-soil, while an opposite condition is equally\r\nunfavorably to those that are naturally more aquatic in their tastes\r\nand habits. In the former case we learn to avoid such soils and\r\nsituations, unless we are able to change their character in this\r\nrespect by thorough under-draining, which will completely remove the\r\nevil, and the remedy becomes merely a question of expense.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of temperature may be assumed as requisite to every\r\nplant, or rather it may be affirmed that some plants cannot exist and\r\nthrive except within a certain range, and it has been asserted that\r\neach class of plants requires a mean temperature for the year that\r\nshall not vary many degrees: the range of this variation has perhaps\r\nnever been satisfactorily ascertained. But it is well known, that both\r\nheat and frost act injuriously upon vegetation. Mr. Lindley tells us\r\nthat \"the extreme limits of temperature which vegetables are capable\r\nof bearing, without destruction of their vitality, have not been\r\ndetermined with precision.\" When the temperature is maintained at a\r\nhigher point than is natural, the plant is excited to undue activity\r\nof growth; but this is attended with an enfeebled condition, often\r\nseen in badly managed green-houses. Mr. Knight found that certain\r\nplants were rendered abortive by the production of male flowers only,\r\nwhen exposed to too great heat, and by an opposite treatment, when\r\nsubjected to a low temperature for a long time, others produced only\r\nfemale flowers. In some plants a high degree of heat, with moisture,\r\nresults in the production of leaves only, and Humboldt found that\r\nwheat was grown about Xalapa, Mexico, as a fodder plant, because it\r\nproduced an abundance of grass, but did not form ears nor grain.\r\n\r\nA diminished temperature, on the contrary, removes the stimulus of\r\ngrowth, and leads to the suspension of all vital action in proportion\r\nto its reduction. At the freezing point it is probable that all such\r\naction ceases, though in this regard there is great difference among\r\nplants; the mosses and lichens will flourish, and the Chickweed will\r\nvegetate and blossom at a temperature very little above freezing. The\r\naccess of frost, after vegetation has somewhat advanced, often proves\r\nvery disastrous, and we not unfrequently lose our crops of fruit by\r\nsuch an occurrence during the period of blossoming, or even afterward.\r\n\r\nSome plants in a dormant condition, will endure uninjured a great\r\ndepression of temperature, while others will be destroyed by the\r\nslightest approach of frost. According to De Candolle, this may depend\r\nupon the greater or less amount of water they contain, upon the\r\ngreater or less viscidity of their fluids, or the rapidity with which\r\nthese fluids circulate. Those with larger cells he thinks most easily\r\ninjured by frost, and those which contain a great deal of air are able\r\nto resist it best. The freezing point will vary according to the\r\nquality of the sap, for we know that different vegetable juices\r\ncongeal at different temperatures. The manner in which cold acts upon\r\nplants depends upon their physical structure. Lindley says, freezing\r\nis attended with the following effects:--The fluids contained within\r\nthe cells of tissue are congealed and expanded--this produces a\r\nlaceration of the cell-walls, and impairs excitability by the\r\nunnatural extension to which the cells are subjected; the air is\r\nexpelled from the air-vessels and introduced into parts naturally\r\nintended to contain only fluid; the green coloring matter and other\r\nsecretions are decomposed, and the vital fluid or latex is destroyed,\r\nand the action of its vessels is paralyzed. The interior of the tubes,\r\nin which fluid is conveyed, is obstructed by a thickening of their\r\nsides. So we have as a result, both mechanical, chemical, and vital\r\nchanges.[16]\r\n\r\nOur hardy fruit trees are woody perennials that hybernate during the\r\nwinter. Yet we find that even these suffer upon some occasions from a\r\ngreat depression of temperature; it has been asserted that a certain\r\ndegree of cold would inevitably destroy the blossom buds at least, and\r\nwe often find that the bark is burst off from the wood, and in some\r\ninstances the wood itself is so injured as to suffer from a kind of\r\ndecomposition, and to become affected with a change generally known as\r\nthe dry rot, losing its elasticity and hardness, and acquiring a\r\nwhitish color, which is supposed may arise from the introduction of\r\nthe mycelia of fungous growths. Now it is believed that these injuries\r\ndo not arise so directly from the degree of cold to which the tree has\r\nbeen exposed, as to the condition of its circulation at the time of\r\nthe exposure. If the sap have been excited by mild or warm weather,\r\nas is so apt to be the case in our changeable climate, the sudden\r\ndepression of temperature will produce disastrous effects, even when\r\nthe cold has not been very severe. This is manifested by the bursting\r\nof the bark in young trees in the early part of winter, while they are\r\nyet holding their leaves, and of course having a circulation somewhat\r\nactive. Hence the importance, now very well understood by our\r\nnurserymen, of checking the growth of young trees in time to have\r\ntheir terminal buds thoroughly ripened before the approach of frost.\r\nThis, to a certain extent, is subject to our control; but we cannot\r\nforesee the character of the seasons upon which the safety of our\r\norchard trees will, in a great measure, depend, and they are less\r\neasily managed. When the autumn is dry, and continued late into\r\nwinter, as sometimes happens, we see a perfect ripening of the wood,\r\nwith a great development of blossom buds, and then we may confidently\r\ncalculate upon the safety of our fruits, provided they be not exposed\r\nto a warm period at mid-winter, that shall excite some activity in\r\ntheir circulation, which would suffer terribly from any sudden and\r\ngreat depression of temperature such as frequently occurs, carrying\r\nthe mercury from summer heat to a point below zero, in a few hours.\r\nSuch a change has amounted to 68 degrees in nine hours.[17]\r\n\r\nThe influence exerted by the soil upon the healthiness or\r\nunhealthiness of our trees has already been alluded to incidentally,\r\nbut it is an important subject of inquiry whether this may arise from\r\na redundancy or a paucity of some particular ingredients necessary to\r\nsustain the plants we desire to cultivate. Liebig has pointed out how\r\nchemistry may be brought to our assistance in solving such a question.\r\nAs all the inorganic elements found in a tree and its fruits, must\r\nhave been derived from the soil in which it grew, he suggested that\r\nthe ashes of the plant would show us exactly what it needed, and then\r\nan examination of the soils would inform us whether they contained all\r\nthe necessary elements, and in the right proportion. Hence arose the\r\ndoctrine and the practice of applying special manures, which has been\r\nso fashionable in our day. Though there be many doubters as to the\r\nefficacy of such investigations and practices, most sensible and\r\nenlightened agriculturists admit the truths which Liebig has\r\npropounded.\r\n\r\nLight is the great stimulus of vegetation, an essential element to its\r\nexistence: its withdrawal is followed by an arrest of some of the most\r\nimportant functions of vitality, and yet we find that there is a great\r\ndifference among different species, as to their requirements of this\r\nelement, and also that various parts and several products of\r\nvegetation require very different degrees of light for their\r\nperfection. It is also found that a sudden exposure of parts from\r\nwhich it had been withheld, is often attended with disastrous\r\nconsequences. Its withdrawal does not so immediately destroy the\r\nplant, being attended with the etiolation of the parts that are\r\nusually colored, but a sudden re-exposure to the sun's rays will now\r\ndestroy the plant. So the removal of a portion of the foliage from a\r\ntree, or the exposure of the bare stem of one that had been previously\r\nsheltered, is often attended with severe effects, known as\r\nsun-scald--for which there is no remedy, but very easy modes of\r\nprevention. The best of these is to provide against the evil by\r\nreserving the lower branches to shade the stem. There are other\r\nexcellent reasons for this practice, which will be brought forward in\r\nthe chapter on Pruning.\r\n\r\nFrequently, however, the nurseryman, or perhaps the injudicious\r\nefforts of the planter himself, may have removed all the side branches\r\nof the young tree, and as these cannot be replaced, we may substitute\r\nfor them a shelter from the scorching sun to which the newly planted\r\ntree is exposed. This may be done by tacking two narrow boards\r\ntogether at their edges, like a gutter spout, and setting them upright\r\non the south side of the tree to shade it. A wisp of straw, tied\r\nloosely to the stem, will answer a very good purpose; but both of\r\nthese appliances are objectionable, because they furnish a shelter for\r\ninsects, and thus they fall short of the natural shading of the stem\r\nby the foliage of its own branches.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the scorching suns of summer that damage our young\r\ntrees that are thus exposed by injudicious trimming. Even the bright\r\nrays of a mid-winter sun, falling upon the frozen stem, will often\r\neffect the most serious damage, and should be guarded against with\r\nequal care; but here the natural protection will answer, for the shade\r\nof the naked spray of the laterals is found all-sufficient in the\r\nwell-trained tree.\r\n\r\n2d--To resume the consideration of Lankester's causes of disease, it\r\nmust be admitted that some diseased conditions may be produced by\r\npoisonous gases, but the usual result will be the death of plants\r\nconfined in such an atmosphere. The natural power of diffusion of all\r\ngases among one another in the open air, prevents the danger that\r\nwould ensue in a confined situation. The accidental production of\r\nsulphurous and other poisonous gas, or the escape of smoke from the\r\nflues or from the tobacco-pan in the green-house, sometimes produces\r\nthe most disastrous effects upon the plants subjected to their action.\r\nSo, in crowded cities, it often happens that the effects of coal smoke\r\nand other gases, generated in the furnaces and manufactories, are very\r\ninjurious to vegetation. The coal soot falls in flakes like\r\nlamp-black, which covers the surface and obstructs the transpiration\r\nof the stomata, and thus seriously affects the health of plants in\r\nsuch situations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe action of _miasmata_, suggested by Lankester, is as obscure in the\r\neffects produced upon plants as in those upon animals. The presence of\r\nthese atmospheric conditions cannot be detected by any of our tests,\r\nnor can their effects be prevented by any means in our power; we know\r\nlittle or nothing about their characters, yet we cannot deny their\r\nexistence: finally, they serve as a very convenient explanation,\r\nthough a very unsatisfactory one, for the incursions of maladies that\r\nare of an obscure or unknown character. Whether of a miasmatic nature\r\nor not, no one can deny the existence of certain atmospheric\r\nconditions, which appear to produce disastrous effects upon some of\r\nour vegetable productions whether these be inherent to the air itself,\r\nor are only conveyed by it from one place to another. The inexplicable\r\npotato disease may owe its origin and diffusion to such a cause, and\r\nthe grape malady, which appears to be dependent upon atmospheric\r\ncauses, may at least be carried from one vine to another upon this\r\nmedium, in the form of the minute spores or seeds of the fungi that\r\nare believed to be the cause of the trouble.[18]\r\n\r\nPoisons in the soil are frequently very deleterious to vegetation, and\r\nwe often find extensive injuries to our plants produced by this class\r\nof agents. When these are of a chemical nature, as is usually the\r\ncase, they may be satisfactorily treated by applications that will\r\nneutralize their effects. In cities the escape of the illuminating\r\ngas, that is carried in subterranean pipes, has often so poisoned the\r\nsoil as to destroy the shade trees by the side of the streets.\r\n\r\nAn excess of certain saline and alkaline ingredients often produces\r\nbarrenness in the soil, by a sort of poisoning, even with those\r\narticles that in smaller quantities are used as manures with the\r\nhappiest effects.\r\n\r\n3d--The influence exerted upon vegetation by the growth of parasitic\r\nplants, cannot be observed without forcing us to the conclusion that\r\nthey are prejudicial to the health of the plants they infest--since\r\nthey either cover and smother the foliage by twining upon it, as is\r\nthe case with the Dodder; or fasten themselves upon a limb,\r\nappropriating the sap that was intended for its support, and thus\r\nstarve it, as does the Mistletoe; or attaching themselves to the bark,\r\nthey interfere with its functions, as is done by the lichens and\r\nmosses; or, following the descending scale, in the size of these\r\nparasites, but meeting in them foes of much greater importance, we\r\nfind the minute but innumerable fungi attacking the wood, the bark,\r\nthe foliage, and the fruits, of our gardens and orchards, and\r\ncommitting incalculable damage--thus entailing serious disease. A\r\nvery important question has arisen, however, as to whether the inroads\r\nof fungi were the cause or the consequence only of disease. A question\r\nwhich it will be necessary to leave to wiser heads, only observing\r\nthat these epiphytes do appear, under certain atmospheric conditions,\r\nto invade some plants that had previously seemed to be in perfect\r\nhealth. That they are transported upon the air, in the form of very\r\nminute sporules, is unquestioned, and that their growth is dependent\r\nupon certain atmospheric conditions, is equally admitted, but whether\r\nthey induce disease, or are only able to take possession of a plant\r\nthat is not in a perfectly healthy condition, does not yet appear so\r\nclear. The very eminent Mr. Solly is of the opinion, that in the\r\npotato at least, the existence of parasitic fungi is a secondary\r\nresult of previous disease. So it may be with our fruits, and there is\r\nconsiderable testimony to favor such a belief in many cases, where we\r\nfind, with the appearance of these fungi, other causes of\r\nunhealthiness.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the apple trees in some seasons become coated with a\r\nblack efflorescence, that gives the tree a very sombre appearance, and\r\nseems to affect its health. I am not aware that any one has yet made\r\nany microscopical investigations of this condition of the foliage,\r\nwhich looks as though it were dusted with coal-smoke. It has been\r\nsupposed, however, to be the result of a fungous growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAR BLIGHT.--This is a subject upon which so much has been said and\r\nwritten, that any one may well shrink from its discussion. The\r\ncondition in which the invasion of the malady finds the tree has been\r\npretty thoroughly ascertained, and the sad state in which it is left\r\nafter the attack, is too well known to need any learned description.\r\nIt is well called _the blight_, for nothing short of scorching by fire\r\ncan more effectually destroy the life of the tree and blight our hopes\r\nof its usefulness. The varied theories and suggestions that have been\r\nadvanced in attempted explanation of this state of things are\r\naltogether unsatisfactory so that it may be said we know nothing about\r\nthe disease, nor whether it be occasioned by frozen sap, by fungous\r\ninvasion, or by insect attacks, all of which have been set forward as\r\ncauses of the difficulty. None of these explanations have been clearly\r\nproved, and they seem rather guesses than established facts in the\r\nhistory of the disease, which breaks out in the midst of the season of\r\ngrowth, and attacks those trees that are in the midst of the most\r\nvigorous production of succulent shoots; but it is not confined to the\r\nyoung wood; on the contrary, it appears first in the hard bark of\r\nlimbs, that are two or more years old. This turns brown, becomes\r\ndesiccated, and thus the circulation is arrested, and the foliage as\r\nwell as the bark is affected. The outer extremities of the leaves\r\nwilt, die, and turn suddenly brown and then black, and often remain\r\nadhering by their petioles for months--sad testimonials of the\r\ndestruction caused by the blight. The disease appears to extend in\r\nsome instances, but it is not proved that there is any poisonous\r\nmatter generated by a blighted limb that could have entered the\r\ncirculation, and then have been transmitted to other parts of the\r\ntree. The apparent extension of the disease is rather believed to have\r\nbeen the successive development of the trouble from different foci,\r\nwhich had successively invaded so much of the bark as to have more or\r\nless completely arrested the flow of the sap. In some limbs of small\r\nsize, a patch of dead tissue of moderate dimensions would entirely\r\narrest healthy action early in the season, and destroy the portion of\r\nthe branch beyond it; in other branches of greater size, quite a large\r\npatch of the dead bark might exist for a long time without entirely\r\nsurrounding them, and arresting the circulation, which would thus be\r\nkept up until a later period, when at length this occurred, the\r\nsymptoms of blight would appear.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of this malady is quite unsatisfactory, and gives us no\r\nclue to the cause of the trouble. Various plans have been suggested,\r\nthe most satisfactory is the removal of the affected limbs--not that\r\nit cures the disease, but because it takes from us the sad mementos of\r\nour loss. We have been advised to pare away the diseased portion of\r\nold bark with a spoke-shave, or some similar instrument; but it is\r\napprehended that few persons would ever find this patch of dead bark\r\nuntil they have the fatal evidence of the blighted foliage, and no\r\npossible good can result from its removal at that time.\r\n\r\nThis trouble is connected, in many instances, with an excessively\r\nvigorous growth of shoots; indeed, some of those varieties which are\r\nmost thrifty, suffer the most, while those which make firm and\r\nmoderately short shoots, seldom blight. Hence it has been inferred by\r\nsome, that if we can check this excessive vigor, and reduce the wood\r\ngrowth to a moderate amount, not exceeding ten or twelve inches,\r\nannual extension, we shall be able to prevent the occurrence of\r\nblight. This object is easily attained by root-pruning the trees\r\nseverely in the spring of the year. So far, we can only say that trees\r\nso treated, have not blighted; but it does not follow that they would\r\nhave suffered if let alone.\r\n\r\nAnother form of blight may often be seen in the peach and in the\r\napple; it consists in a loss of vitality of small twigs and their\r\nfoliage in several parts of the tree, especially in the inner portions\r\nthat are not freely exposed to the air and light. In the peach, this\r\ndisease is accompanied with the decay of the fruit upon these twigs,\r\nwhich rots and becomes moldy. This trouble is usually attributed to\r\nmildew, and it is probably owing to some form of fungus invasion.\r\n\r\nQuite a different affection of the twigs is that known as the \"blight\"\r\nin apples and quinces. This attacks only the young shoots of the\r\ncurrent season's growth, which suddenly wither and become brown at\r\nmid-summer. The same condition occurs also in the shoots of the\r\nItalian mulberry. The cause of this malady is not very apparent; by\r\nsome persons it is attributed to the punctures of minute insects, but\r\nthey have escaped the scrutiny of other observers, who attribute this\r\nblight to atmospheric causes.\r\n\r\nThe true apple blight is a malady of very serious character, that\r\ninvades many orchards in the Western States. In its nature, and in the\r\nmode of its invasion, it very much resembles the dreaded fire-blight\r\nof the pear, with which most orchardists have unfortunately become\r\nalready but too familiar. Like it too, all the guesses which Solons\r\nhave offered for the explanation of its cause, appear equally\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nA whole branch or limb of the tree becomes simultaneously affected;\r\nsometimes one quarter or even one half of the top is destroyed by the\r\ndisease, and the removal of the dead portions is not followed by the\r\nreproduction of healthy branches. Certain varieties are more subject\r\nto this blight than others, and they seem to poison the grafts that\r\nare inserted into them, to produce a new top to the tree with a more\r\nhealthy variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTER ROT.--Our excellent and observing friend, H.N. Gillett, of\r\nLawrence Co., Ohio, furnishes the following description of this\r\ndisease to the Ohio Cultivator:\r\n\r\n\"The disease generally presents itself on the skin of the apple in\r\nvery minute brown spots, from one to a dozen or more in number,\r\ngenerally after the fruit is pretty well grown. These gradually spread\r\nand penetrate the flesh of the apple, producing a black rot, almost as\r\nbitter as aloes, but this taste is confined to the discolored portion.\r\nThe fruit ceases growing, and falls prematurely. The rot occasionally\r\nbegins at the center, and extends outward, so that the fruit appears\r\nperfectly sound for some time,\" on which account he advises against\r\ntoo early gathering of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Barker, of McConnellsville, Ohio, who was one of our most\r\nobserving pomologists, referring to this disease as peculiar to\r\ncertain varieties, concludes in an article in the paper above quoted,\r\nvide Vol. VI., p. 283, that this malady is different from what is\r\ncalled Bitter Rot in other places, and which affects other varieties\r\nwith a discoloration of the flesh and a bitter taste. He thinks this\r\nmalady is different from that described by Mr. Gillett, and that it,\r\nthe true Bitter Rot, is caused by a fungous growth, the spores of\r\nwhich are carried on the air from tree to tree, like a similar fungus\r\nproducing mold in the cherry, plum, and peach. He also traces a\r\nresemblance of this disease to the vaccination in the human subject,\r\nexcept that the scab does not separate and fall off. Hence he\r\nsuggested the name of _pock_, instead of _Bitter Rot_. High culture,\r\nmanure, lime, trimming, and pasturing hogs in the orchard, have all\r\nbeen recommended as remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRACKED FRUIT--MILDEW.--Certain fruits become partially covered with\r\nwhat appears to be a fungous growth, which occupies the skin in such a\r\nmanner as to prevent the development of the succulent tissues beneath\r\nit. This may result in a deformity consequent upon the irregular\r\ngrowth, and the fruit is called scabby, or it may strike deeper into\r\nthe tissues, which become dry and corky and crack open, being thus\r\nutterly worthless. Some varieties, which formerly produced the most\r\nbeautiful fruits, have been so severely affected by this malady as to\r\nyield absolutely nothing in certain localities, and are only rendered\r\nprofitable by top grafting with other sorts that are not affected with\r\nthe cracking. That this is not caused by the wearing out of the\r\nvariety, as has been suggested, it may be added that the same fruit\r\nripens perfectly and is quite fair in other regions of the country.\r\nThe trouble, however, is extending, and it is hardly safe to plant\r\nlargely of those varieties that have proved subject to the malady. No\r\nexplanation has been satisfactory as to the cause, nor has any\r\ntreatment been successful.\r\n\r\nDr. Kirtland addressed the Ohio Pomological Society upon this subject,\r\nand an abstract of his remarks is here given:--\r\n\r\n\"The disease known as the blight or the fire-blight, is at this day\r\nproving the most serious obstacle to the successful cultivation of the\r\npear, in many sections of the country. Early in the present century\r\nit prevailed extensively in New England, coincidently with the spotted\r\nfever, and other disorders of a low grade of action, which at that\r\nperiod swept epidemically over that region of the country. It was a\r\npopular opinion that all these diseases, both of the human family and\r\nvegetable kingdom, arose from one cause;--an opinion not, however,\r\ntolerated by medical men and men of science in that day.\r\n\r\n\"Various theories have been advanced to account for the origin of this\r\nblight. Insects, frozen sap, electricity, excessive evaporation, and\r\nexhaustion of the soil, have, at different times, been assigned as the\r\ncause. Investigation of each fails to meet and explain the phenomena\r\nattendant on the rise, progress, and results of that disease. It is\r\ntime they all should be abandoned, and that researches for a cause be\r\nextended in some other direction.\r\n\r\n\"As a starting point in this undertaking, I will suggest another\r\nhypothesis, which may perhaps explain the pathology of the blight, and\r\ncall into use an effectual remedy or preventive. _Pathology_, Dr.\r\nWebster defines to be 'the doctrine of the causes and nature of\r\ndiseases.'\r\n\r\n\"1. The Pear-tree blight is produced by the poisonous impression of\r\nthe seeds (_sporules_) of a microscopic fungus.\r\n\r\n\"2. Several combinations of iron, especially the sulphate\r\n(_copperas_), will, to some extent, counteract that impression.\r\n\r\n\"It will be understood that these two propositions are merely\r\nhypothetical. If sustained by analogies, subsequent observations, and\r\nexperience, they will be accepted as truths; if not thus sustained,\r\nthey will of course be rejected.\r\n\r\n\"The extensive prevalence of the cholera, over large portions of the\r\nglobe, commencing in the year 1818, led medical men to seek for its\r\ncause. Dr. Cowdell, of London, in 1848, published 'A Disquisition on\r\nPestilential Cholera, being an attempt to explain its phenomena,\r\nnature, cause, prevention and treatment, by reference to an extrinsic\r\nfungous origin.'\r\n\r\n\"In 1849, Prof. J.K. Mitchell, of Philadelphia, issued a more\r\nelaborate work, 'On the Cryptogamous Origin of Malarious and Epidemic\r\nFevers.' It abounds in numerous facts and correct reasoning, and\r\nshould be consulted by every investigator of disease, animal and\r\nvegetable.\r\n\r\n\"These publications attracted the attention of the medical profession,\r\nboth in America and Europe, so long as that epidemic continued its\r\nravages, and the theories they advanced gained extensive credence\r\nduring that time. They were, however, lost sight of when that epidemic\r\nsubsided. Recently they have been substantiated as plain matters of\r\nfact, so far as malarious diseases are concerned, by the labors and\r\ninvestigations of Prof. J.H. Salisbury, of Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"It is well established, then, that a number of diseases of the animal\r\nsystem are produced by fungi. 'Under this name botanists comprehend\r\nnot only the various races of mushrooms, toadstools, and similar\r\nproductions, but a large number of microscopic plants, forming the\r\nappearances called mouldiness, mildew, smut, rust, brand, dry rot,\r\netc.' They are universally diffused in nature. It is difficult to\r\nconceive of a place where they do not exist. They are among the most\r\nnumerous of all plants, in regard to genera and species, and with very\r\nfew exceptions are deleterious in their impressions on the animal\r\nsystem. Even the palatable mushroom is always poisonous to some\r\npersons, and may become so to all under certain circumstances. It is\r\nequally evident that fungi frequently occasion diseases in the\r\nvegetable kingdom. The smut of wheat and maize, the rust of wheat,\r\nergot of rye and grass-seeds, and specks, cracks, and discoloration of\r\nthe skin of the apple and pear are of this nature.\r\n\r\n\"The microscopical examinations of Prof. Salisbury and others have\r\ndetected the presence of certain species, infesting extensively pear\r\ntrees about the period of attack by the blight. They have made similar\r\ndiscoveries that lead to the conclusion that the curl of the peach\r\nleaf, the potato disease, and the blight of pear trees, all have their\r\norigin from the cause assigned in my second proposition.\r\n\r\n\"Under this head still another disease of our fruit should be noticed.\r\nI have watched carefully the sudden and premature decay of our plum\r\ncrop, at the period of its ripening, for the last fifteen years. From\r\nhints afforded by the work of Prof. Mitchell, and several microscopic\r\nobservations of my own, I was induced to publish an article in 'The\r\nFlorist,' of Philadelphia, in the year 1855, in which I imputed the\r\norigin of the disease to the Torula or some analagous species of\r\nparasitic fungi. The disease still prevails among us, and it is sure\r\nto destroy all the plums which escape puncture by the curculio. It is,\r\nhowever, generally overlooked by pomologists, and its effects are\r\ncharged to the depredations of that insect. Similar disease\r\noccasionally impairs our peach and apple crops, to a less extent.\r\nWhenever it occurs on either of these varieties of fruit, the spurs\r\nand young wood blight or canker, and cease to be fruitful for several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"If these discoveries and analogies establish, with any degree of\r\ncertainty, the hypothesis of the cryptogamous origin of the pear tree\r\nblight, we have made important progress in laying down true\r\nindications for its cure or prevention. Among the means suggested for\r\neffecting that end, certain combinations of iron have already been\r\nnamed. The authority for such practice is founded on the following\r\nfacts:\r\n\r\n\"1. It is a popular belief that iron exerts a favorable influence over\r\nthe health of fruit trees. Hence arises the practice of driving nails\r\ninto the body of such trees, and loading their limbs with scraps of\r\niron. Both the belief and the practice may be visionary, yet in such\r\ninstances of popular belief, investigation usually discovers them to\r\nbe founded on some shadow of truth.\r\n\r\n\"2. An intelligent and observing gentleman of Cleveland informs me\r\nthat he prevents the curl of the peach leaf by depositing in the\r\nearth, about the bodies of the trees, fragments of rusty stove pipe\r\nand worthless pieces of iron.\r\n\r\n\"3. Twenty-four years since I called the attention of the public to\r\nthe isolated fact, without reference to any theory, that a large pear\r\ntree in Columbiana county, Ohio, with its body surrounded with many\r\nwagon loads of boulders, scoria, scales of iron and accumulations from\r\na blacksmith shop, retained its health, vigor, and fruitfulness, while\r\nall other pear trees in that region of country had either died, or\r\nwere suffering from blight. _Vide_ New England Farmer, December 3,\r\n1840, page 153. At this late day this tree still continues healthy.\r\n\r\n\"4. I recollect reading in that reliable journal, Hovey's Magazine of\r\nHorticulture, some years since, a statement that the finest prize\r\npears seen in the Parisian market, were produced by investing the\r\ngrowing fruits with folds of cotton or linen cloth, and daily, or\r\noftener, moistening them with a solution of sulphate of iron. This\r\ntreatment was said to result in developing the size, beauty, and\r\nquality of the fruits to a high degree, and especially to free them\r\nfrom parasitic blotches.\r\n\r\n\"5. Four years since, Mrs. Weller Dean, of Rockport, Ohio, informed me\r\nthat blight might not only be prevented in healthy pear trees, but\r\nmight be successfully arrested, in many trees, after it had made\r\nconsiderable progress, by means of repeatedly washing the bodies of\r\nthe trees with a saturated solution of sulphate of iron (copperas), at\r\na time when the sap is in active circulation.\r\n\r\n\"This was a confidential communication, with the condition annexed\r\nthat I should thoroughly test the plan, and if it should prove\r\nsuccessful, I was to publish it; and furthermore, if any merit or more\r\nsubstantial reward should be deemed due to any one by the public, she\r\nwas to be the recipient.\r\n\r\n\"This plan has yet been only imperfectly tried. Age and infirmities\r\nwill probably prevent its completion by me. I will therefore report\r\nthat I have tested it on a number of my partially blighted pear trees,\r\nwhile a greater numbers has been left to die unmedicated. Of the\r\nformer, not one has yet perished, while of the latter very few\r\nsurvive. It has appeared, in every instance, to arrest the progress of\r\nthe disease, and to impart a healthy condition to the bark wherever\r\napplied. The apparent results may have been coincidences and not the\r\neffect of the remedy. There is much false experience in horticulture\r\nand agriculture, as well as in medicine.\r\n\r\n\"These views suggest the expediency of extensively applying a solution\r\nof the sulphate of iron by means of a green-house syringe or garden\r\nengine to the tops and foliage of trees, laboring under any of the\r\ndiseases suspected of a cryptogamous origin. It also becomes a query\r\nwhether the same agent may not be successfully employed at some period\r\nto counteract the potato disease, either by watering with it the\r\ngrowing plant, or washing the tubers in it in autumn, after they are\r\ndug. No injury has ever arisen to pear trees by a free use of a\r\n_saturated_ solution of copperas.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, I would observe that the discovery of the cryptogamous\r\norigin of the many disorders of the human system is effecting\r\nimportant changes in their treatment. May we not hope that an\r\nextension of these discoveries to the vegetable kingdom, may result as\r\nfavorably in shaping the practice in diseases of fruits and fruit\r\ntrees?\"\r\n\r\n4th--Wounds, and the attacks of insects, may be considered more in the\r\nlight of mechanical injuries by a loss of substance, hence they belong\r\nrather to the department of surgery, and can scarcely be considered as\r\ndisease. The breaking of a branch, or the removal of a portion of the\r\nbark, may inflict a serious injury, but it is one which, under\r\nordinary circumstances, will be recovered from, without any impairment\r\nof the health of the tree--unless where the wound is so large that the\r\nnew growth will not soon cover it over, in which case exposure to the\r\nmoisture of the atmosphere may result in decay of the woody tissues,\r\nor, if the sap exudes, at certain seasons, it may produce canker and\r\nfungous growths. In some varieties of our cultivated fruits, wounds of\r\nthis character are often attended by an effusion of gummy matter; this\r\nis particularly the case with those that are known as stone-fruits,\r\nand in these the excision of a large limb is seldom followed by a\r\ndeposit of woody matter in the way of healing over the wound, which is\r\nalways desirable; hence in such cases particularly, it is well to\r\ncover the exposed surface with something to exclude atmospheric\r\nmoisture, whether this be paint, varnish, of shellac, or common\r\ngrafting wax.\r\n\r\nInsects, by eating the foliage extensively, very materially injure the\r\nhealthy condition of a tree--even the minute aphides that suck the sap\r\nfrom the leaves and tender bark, will seriously impair the health of\r\nour plants; but the borers that mine under the bark, extensively\r\nconsuming the vital cambium, and even burrow into the solid wood,\r\nreducing it to a honeycomb, cannot fail to affect the healthy\r\ncondition of the tree materially, and often cause its premature death.\r\nSome knowledge of the habits of these little creatures is considered\r\nof so great importance, that the subject will be brought before the\r\nreader's notice more at length in another part of this volume.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that many unhealthy conditions of our\r\ntrees, that might be traced to other causes, but which are not\r\nmanifestly dependent upon a want of care on the part of the\r\norchardist, nor upon a deficiency in the constitution of the soil, are\r\noften attributable to the inroads of these minute foes, which, in some\r\ncases at least, are made the scape-goats upon which is laid the blame\r\nthat should be applied to our own neglect, or want of forethought and\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter having reviewed the whole subject, it may be safe for us to\r\nconclude that what is called disease in our cultivated vegetables of\r\nwhatever kind, is a departure from full health and productiveness of\r\nsound fruits. And further that this may arise from a lack of the\r\nnecessary ingredients in the soil, from a want of proper conditions as\r\nto its quality and constitution, particularly with regard to the\r\nimportant elements of moisture, heat, and light; and especially, that\r\nthis condition of unhealthiness and unproductiveness, when not an\r\ninherent failing of the variety, may in many instances be attributable\r\nto want of proper care on our part, and to our allowing the trees to\r\ninjure themselves by overbearing, while we neglect to keep up the\r\nproper supply of nourishment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn making selections of trees for planting, it is important that all\r\nweak or unhealthy varieties should be avoided. Secure healthy and\r\nvigorous stocks, that appear to be possessed of a sound constitution,\r\neven though the fruit should not be quite so fine and beautiful as\r\nthat produced by some of the sickly and less vigorous varieties. There\r\nis more difference apparent, in this respect, among pears than among\r\napples; but of the latter there are varieties that should be avoided\r\non account of their deficient vigor. There are others that might be\r\nconsidered as coming under the ban, because the trees are not\r\nlong-lived; and yet some of these appear to be perfectly healthy in\r\nevery other respect, and seem literally to wear themselves out by\r\nexcessive bearing, producing annual crops of large and handsome\r\nfruit, until, utterly exhausted, they reach a premature end.\r\n\r\nSome varieties, that for many years yielded very fine crops of the\r\nmost beautiful fruit, and of the highest character for flavor, have\r\nafterward ceased to furnish any perfect specimens--the whole crop\r\nbeing covered and deformed with the black scab or fungus, that\r\nprevents their development, or else ruined by the disagreeable\r\nbitter-rot which entirely spoils them for any use. Various remedies\r\nhave been suggested for these maladies, all of which are more or less\r\nunsatisfactory, because from our ignorance of the causes of the\r\ntroubles; these applications are wholly empirical.\r\n\r\nThe Black-knot, which has become very common in some parts of the\r\ncountry, is well discussed by Benjamin D. Walsh, in the Practical\r\nEntomologist, for March, 1866, page 48.\r\n\r\nThis essay is the more valuable because of the absence of the\r\nempiricism just complained of:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a black, puffy, irregular swelling on the twigs and smaller\r\nlimbs of plum and cherry trees, and, in one instance that came under\r\nmy personal observation of peach trees, making its first appearance in\r\nthe latitude of New York early in June, and attaining its full growth\r\nby the end of July. Usually a tree, that is attacked in this manner,\r\nis affected worse and worse every year, until it is finally killed;\r\nand wherever one tree of a group is affected, the malady usually\r\nspreads to them all in process of time. In 1865 whole cherry orchards\r\nwere destroyed in Western New York by this disease, and I have myself\r\nseen many groups of wild plum trees in Illinois that were gradually\r\nperishing by it; but in Southern Ohio, as I am told, the Black-knot is\r\nnever met with. In the Eastern States it has been observed from time\r\nimmemorial, and various contradictory opinions have been broached as\r\nto its real nature and origin.\r\n\r\n\"In 1865 I watched the Black-knot carefully through all its stages,\r\nfrom its earliest commencement to its complete maturity, experimenting\r\nat the same time on numerous specimens collected week after week, so\r\nas to ascertain what insects bred in it. The practical conclusion I\r\nhave arrived at, is simply this:--_If the diseased twigs are all cut\r\noff and destroyed early in July in the latitude of New York, or a\r\nlittle earlier or later according to the latitude, taking care to cut\r\na few inches below the affected part, the Black-knot can be checked\r\nand probably entirely eradicated; but if this operation is delayed\r\ntill August, it will be of no benefit whatever._ Hence we can easily\r\naccount for a circumstance which has puzzled many men wonderfully,\r\nviz.: That cutting off and burning the diseased twigs is pronounced by\r\nsome to be a sovereign remedy, and by others to be a delusive humbug.\r\nThose that do this early enough, find it effectual; those that delay\r\nit till too late, find it of no use.\r\n\r\n\"This perhaps will be sufficient for some few impatient souls, who\r\ntake everything upon trust that they see in print, and care nothing\r\nabout the _rationale_ of a mode of treatment, so long as it be\r\npractically available. But for the benefit of that large class of\r\nintelligent agriculturists, who have been deluded by too many quack\r\nprescriptions to place much faith in any man's _ipse dixit_, and who\r\nin any case like to understand the principle of a remedy before they\r\napply it, I subjoin a full account of all that is at present known on\r\nthis subject, and of the different theories respecting it entertained\r\nby different writers.\r\n\r\n\"Three radically different theories have been broached as to the\r\nnature and origin of Black-knot: 1st, that it is a mere disease of the\r\ntree, like the cancer or the gout in the human race, which is the view\r\nmaintained by Dr. Fitch, the State Entomologist of New York; 2d, that\r\nit is what naturalists term a \"gall,\" produced by some unknown insect\r\ndepositing its eggs in the twig--just as the well-known \"oak-apples\"\r\nare produced by a Gall-fly, (_Cynips_), depositing its egg in the bud\r\nof the oak--which is the opinion that I myself formerly held and\r\nmaintained, before I had fully examined into the subject;\r\n(_Proceedings Ent. Soc., Phil._, III, p.p. 613-618;) and 3d, that it\r\nis what botanists term an epiphytous fungus, growing on the tree as a\r\nmushroom or toad-stool grows on the ground, which is the opinion of\r\nthe botanist Schweinitz, and which has recently been re-asserted by\r\nMr. Glover, the Entomologist of the Bureau of Agriculture at\r\nWashington, (_Ag'l Rep._, 1863, p. 572.) This last is the opinion\r\nwhich, upon full inquiry, I have now adopted.\r\n\r\n\"Before discussing these theories, the facts arrived at by myself in\r\nthe summer of 1865, must first be briefly noticed. It should be\r\npremised that the old, dry Black-knot remains on the tree for many\r\nyears, and that the place to look for the new Black-knot is on such\r\ntrees as have been already attacked and are loaded with old\r\nBlack-knot, without being as yet completely killed by it.\r\n\r\n\"1st. By the middle of June the new Black-knot is pretty well\r\ndeveloped, and may then be readily distinguished from the old by its\r\ndull, opaque, brown-black color, while the old is coal-black and more\r\nor less glossy. When cut into, it is found to be fleshy inside, like\r\nan apple, but not juicy, and of a pale greenish-yellow color, with\r\nfibres radiating from the axis of the twig, while the old Black-knot\r\nis internally hard and woody, and of a reddish-brown or rust-red\r\ncolor. The brown-black color of the external surface is retained till\r\nthe last week in July, when the surface of the new Black-knot becomes\r\ngradually covered all over with little, coal-black, hemispherical\r\nplates, appearing when viewed through a pocket glass, about the size\r\nof the head of a pin, each of these is a distinct fungus, named long\r\nago by Schweinitz '_Sphæria morbosa_.' Even on the old Black-knot this\r\nfungus may be readily seen, at any time of the year, covering its\r\nentire surface. So far I have added little to the information already\r\npublished on this subject, except by the specification of dates. But\r\nin addition to these facts, I discovered that about the last of July\r\nor the first week in August, there grows from each fungus on the\r\nsurface of the Black-knot a little cylindrical filament about\r\none-eighth of an inch long, which no doubt bears the seed or \"spores,\"\r\nas they are technically termed, of the fungus, and that these\r\nfilaments very shortly afterwards fall off and disappear, leaving\r\nbehind them the hemispherical plates, which alone had been hitherto\r\nnoticed by the botanists. In another Epiphytous fungus, which grows\r\ncommonly and abundantly in Illinois on the Red Cedar, but which\r\ndiffers from the Black-knot in being attached to the twig by a very\r\nshort stalk or peduncle, and in being roundish and externally of a\r\nreddish-brown color instead of elongate and black, there is a\r\nprecisely similar phenomenon; except that the plates and filaments are\r\nvery much larger, and that each filament, when it falls off, leaves a\r\nragged scar behind it. In a single specimen of Black-knot noticed\r\nAugust 6th, I discovered that the filaments not only covered the\r\nentire surface of the Black-knot itself, except where a few of them\r\nhad already fallen off, but that they were thinly studded over the\r\ntwig for an inch or two above and below the swollen black part; thus\r\nproving that the fungus sometimes extends rather further than on a\r\ncursory view it would appear to do. Towards the middle of August, the\r\nnew Black-knot, having perfected its seed, gradually dries up and\r\nbecomes internally of a reddish-brown color. In other words, like so\r\nmany other annual plants, it dies shortly after it has perfected its\r\nseed, just as a stalk of wheat or of corn dies shortly after the grain\r\nis ripe.\r\n\r\n\"2d. During the months of June and July I collected from time to time\r\nvery numerous specimens of Black-knot, some of which I cut into to see\r\nwhat larvæ they contained, and some I preserved to see what perfect\r\ninsects could be bred from them. Besides seven specimens of the common\r\n\"Curculio,\" which many persons had previously bred from Black-knot, I\r\nbred for the first time therefrom no less than five distinct species\r\nof insects, none of which can be considered as gall-makers, but not a\r\nsingle true gall-maker; and I can confirm Dr. Fitch's assertion, that\r\nsome specimens are wholly free from larvæ of any kind when cut into.\r\n\r\n\"We will now take up in order the three different theories respecting\r\nthe nature and origin of Black-knot, which, as already stated, have\r\nbeen maintained by different writers.\r\n\r\n\"1st. _That Black-knot is a mere disease like the cancer._--Dr. Fitch,\r\nwho maintains this opinion, allows that the black granules found on\r\nthe Black-knot are a true fungus, 'that the surface of these\r\nexcrescences, when mature, is always covered with this plant,' and\r\nthat 'this plant never grows, or at least has never been found, in any\r\nother situation.' (_Address N.Y. State Ag'l Soc._, 1860, p. 21.) * * *\r\n\r\n\"2d. _That Black-knot is a gall._--As already stated, there is no true\r\ngall-making insect that inhabits the Black-knot, so far as I can\r\ndiscover on the fullest and most extensive investigation that I have\r\nbeen able to give to the subject. The minute holes commonly found in\r\nthe old dry Black-knot, which are too large either for the 'Curculio'\r\nor for the small moths bred by myself from Black-knot, are of a\r\nsuitable size for either of the two dipterous' insects which I have\r\nenumerated in a note as bred by myself from Black-knot. Consequently\r\nthe argument which I based upon the existence of these minute holes\r\n(_Proc. Ent. Soc. Phil._ III, p. 614) falls to the ground; and\r\nalthough I found on one occasion the larva of a Gall-gnat embedded in\r\na cell in a Black-knot, yet this was most probably that of the Guest\r\nGall-gnat which I actually bred from Black-knot, as stated in the\r\nnote, and not of a true gall-making Gall-gnat.\r\n\r\n\"3d. _That Black knot is a fungus._--Just as Dr. Fitch, having proved\r\nto his own satisfaction that Black-knot is neither a gall nor a\r\nfungus, infers by the method of exhaustion that it must be a disease;\r\nso, having proved that it is neither a disease nor a gall, we may\r\ninfer by the method of exhaustion that it must be a fungus, or rather\r\nan assemblage of funguses. In confirmation of this theory may be\r\nadduced the very remarkable analogies between the structure of the\r\nBlack-knot and that of the fungus, described above as occurring on Red\r\nCedar. That this last is really and truly a fungus and not a gall, is\r\nshown by the fact, that it is scarcely ever inhabited by insects; for\r\nout of hundreds of specimens that I have cut into, both green and dry,\r\nnot more than two or three contained the larvæ of the moths, but one\r\ncontained what was probably the larva of an Ichneumon-fly, and all the\r\nrest were perfectly solid and unbored. On the other hand, Black-knot\r\nis so infested by insects, that it is almost impossible to find a\r\nmature specimen that is not all bored up by them. The cause of this\r\nremarkable difference may be attributed to the well-known repugnance\r\nof almost all kinds of insects for Red Cedar.\r\n\r\n\"If, then, Black-knot is a fungus, and if, as I think I have shown, it\r\nis an annual plant propagating itself by seed or the so-called\r\n'spores,' and the 'spores' make their appearance about the end of July\r\nin latitude 41° 30', then it must be obvious that if all the\r\nBlack-knot on a particular tree is cut off and destroyed in the\r\nfore-part of July, or a little earlier or later as you go further\r\nsouth or further north, an effectual stop will be put to its further\r\npropagation. It is true that the 'spores' are in the form of an\r\nimpalpable powder, so that they may be carried some considerable\r\ndistance from other infected trees by the wind; and it may possibly be\r\nfurther true, that certain 'spores' may lie dormant in the bark for\r\nover a year, as the seeds of weeds will often lie dormant in the\r\nground. Still, with all these possible drawbacks, I have little doubt\r\nthat the above remedy will, as a general rule, if applied according to\r\ndirections, be found effectual.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is interesting as giving the conclusions of an\r\nentomologist who had investigated the subject, and arrived at the same\r\nresult that had been reached by a botanist many years before.\r\nSchweinitz, in 1832, published the correct history of the Black-knot\r\nin the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. In the\r\n_American Agriculturist_, April, 1863, p. 113, Mr. C.F. Austin\r\nconfirmed Schweinitz's observations, and gave a popular account of the\r\nbotany of this fungus, with figures. It may be considered as fully\r\nestablished that the knot is of vegetable origin; and whenever insects\r\nor larvæ are found in it, it is only because they find a diseased\r\nportion of the tree suited to their necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\nROT AND MILDEW upon the grape both destroy our crops, and render the\r\nvines unhealthy. Would that I were able to give the reader some\r\nencouragement as to its cause and prevention, or cure; but some of our\r\noldest and most experienced vine-planters have come to the conclusion,\r\nas to treatment, that \"the more they find out, the more they don't\r\nknow.\" It is now generally conceded that it is caused by a fungus\r\ngrowth. That on the leaves is probably the _Oidium Tuckeri_, and it is\r\ngenerally supposed that the mildew and rot of the berries is owing to\r\nthe same cause. The microscope clearly indicates its fungoid\r\ncharacter. As to the causes, it must be admitted that the weather\r\nfavors or prevents its access, and that so far it is a proximate\r\ncause, but that the spores are the true origin of the trouble. The\r\nCincinnati Horticultural Society, whose members have long had\r\nopportunities of studying this malady, have come to the following\r\nconclusions, which, it will be seen, are not very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n    _To the Cincinnati Horticultural Society_:--We have been\r\n    appointed by you to discharge a certain function. Having\r\n    examined the premises and considered the subject, we do now\r\n    report: That, notwithstanding the discouragements attendant upon\r\n    the experience of most vine-dressers during the past season, we\r\n    are determined to persevere in viticulture, for the following\r\n    among other reasons:\r\n\r\n    We have our capital invested in a way which _has been_\r\n    profitable, and we believe _will be_ so again.\r\n\r\n    Our lands are occupied with a growth that has required time and\r\n    labor to produce, and which we are unwilling to sacrifice.\r\n\r\n    We do not believe that the diseases to which the vines and fruit\r\n    have been subjected, are dependent upon long pruning or short\r\n    pruning, upon deep culture or shallow, nor any of the causes to\r\n    which it has been attributed, that are under the immediate\r\n    control of man, but that the cause is CLIMATIC.\r\n\r\n    We do not believe that the rot and mildew can be warded off by\r\n    leaving the wood upon the vines, nor that the usual vineyard\r\n    method called short pruning, will render our vineyards more\r\n    subject to this disease.\r\n\r\n    We do believe, however, that we have yet much to learn in regard\r\n    to the _philosophy of pruning_ which it were well for us to\r\n    study, and that by so doing we may gather some useful hints in\r\n    relation to this very important part of a vine-grower's duties.\r\n\r\n    We do believe, as a result of our observations, that some\r\n    varieties of grapes are more healthy and vigorous than others;\r\n    and, on the other hand, that some are peculiarly subject to the\r\n    inroads of these maladies which have so terribly affected the\r\n    fruit, the foliage, and the green wood of our vines. We do\r\n    firmly believe, that our societies should avoid recommending the\r\n    extensive planting of any trees or vines that have not proved\r\n    themselves general healthy, and free from the maladies in\r\n    question, for a number of years, after trial in different\r\n    situations.\r\n\r\n    We do believe that systematic efforts should be made with\r\n    different remedial and preventive agents, to avert the disasters\r\n    that have overtaken our vine-crops of late years, and, with this\r\n    view, as we have reason to believe that the difficulty depends\r\n    upon the existence of some epiphytic plant, and as we are\r\n    informed that sulphur and sulphate of iron exert an obnoxious\r\n    influence upon the whole class of fungi, we recommend our\r\n    brother vine-dressers to take courage, and to make vigorous and\r\n    systematic efforts to ward off the difficulty the coming season,\r\n    by the regular and persevering applications of these substances\r\n    to their grape vines.\r\n\r\n    For your encouragement, we will also refer you to the history of\r\n    the vineyards of Europe, which have suffered in like manner, and\r\n    which have at length recuperated their energies and become\r\n    productive. Why may not the same good fortune await us?\r\n\r\n                             Very respectfully submitted, by\r\n                                           R.

ADAPTATION OF SORTS TO SOILS.\r\n    GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN MAKING SELECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSITE.--The selection of a suitable site for an orchard is a matter of\r\nno small moment to him who would be a successful grower of fine\r\nfruits. Without, at this time, pausing to inquire into the characters\r\nof the soil, let us examine more particularly the _aspect_ of the\r\nfield to be appropriated to this important crop; for the orchard is a\r\npermanent investment, and so much depends upon the site, that we\r\nshould make some sacrifice of our convenience, rather than commit any\r\nerror in this particular. In the first place, then, let it be\r\nunderstood that the orchard should be well exposed to the sun and air.\r\nThe least desirable positions for orchard planting are narrow valleys,\r\nparticularly limestone valleys in a mountainous country, traversed by\r\na small brook, or where the surface is _spouty_ from springs or\r\nsubjacent water. Even if such depressions are considerably elevated,\r\nbut surrounded by higher and abrupt elevations, they will be found\r\nobnoxious to late and early frosts in spring and fall, especially the\r\nformer, which are often disastrous in such situations, after the\r\nfruit-buds have expanded in these sheltered nooks. Every one at all\r\nconversant with meteorological observations made in a broken country,\r\nis aware of the different range of temperature that will be indicated\r\nby instruments suspended at different elevations.[19] When the cooling\r\ninfluence of radiation has lowered the temperature of the surface of\r\nthe earth and of objects near it, the stratum of air in immediate\r\ncontact will be chilled, and growing heavier, will flow down into the\r\nmost depressed situations, and, accumulating there, will cause a\r\ndifference of several degrees of temperature. This, when near the\r\nfreezing point, will be of the greatest consequence to tender\r\nvegetation, which may be preserved in perfect safety at forty degrees,\r\nbut will be destroyed at thirty degrees, or even at a higher point, in\r\nsome cases.\r\n\r\nThe _frost line_ becomes a very important subject of inquiry in the\r\nselection of an orchard site, and in some countries we find that its\r\nposition may be definitely settled within a limited range of\r\nelevation; not that a certain level can be indicated, above which\r\nthere will always be an immunity from frost, while all below will\r\nsuffer, but we may approximate, in certain situations, so nearly as to\r\nindicate that certain sites are safe or unsafe.\r\n\r\nNor is it the absolute elevation alone that is to be taken into the\r\naccount; in any given locality, we may assume that the higher the\r\norchard is situated above the water levels, the safer it will be, and\r\nthat the lowest depressions are the most unsafe or frosty. It is not\r\nalways the mere elevation, but rather the relative elevation of the\r\nsite, that renders it more desirable than another in the same region.\r\nThere are many orchards that are situated upon a moderate bluff, with\r\na rapid descent of only a few feet or yards, into a swale or valley of\r\nmoderate extent; these we find to be uninjured, when another at a\r\ngreater elevation, but in a depressed basin surrounded by higher\r\nlands, will be found to have suffered from the influence of frost. In\r\nthe one case, the cold air could flow off rapidly into the adjoining\r\ndepression, while in the other, the cold air from adjoining slopes\r\nwould collect, and accumulate in the situations described.\r\n\r\nIn the great plateaus of the world, we often find immense tracts of\r\nland so nearly of the same level as scarcely to afford sufficient\r\ndrainage for the surplus water; of course, we should expect to find,\r\nin such places, little variation of temperature arising from\r\ndifference in elevation. But even in such situations, whether we\r\nexamine the table-lands of our timbered regions, or the extended\r\nareas of the prairie country, we shall find that the drift formation\r\nwhich covers these vast tracts, has not been distributed evenly, but\r\nthat there are successive rolls or swells frequently recurring, which\r\ngive, in some instances, considerable variations of level. A bold\r\nridge, of fifty feet or more in hight, rises abruptly from the level\r\nprairie, stretching along for miles, and affording admirable exposures\r\nfor orchard sites. Such places are observed to be free from late and\r\nearly frosts. In other places, there is an abrupt depression of the\r\nsurface, answering the same purpose--drawing off the cold air. These\r\nmay be very moderate in their extent, as the prairie sloughs, or they\r\nmay be small vales, the courses of the minor streams, or of larger\r\nextent, the valleys of rivers, or the depressions of lakes. In these\r\nlatter cases, the modifying influences of considerable bodies of water\r\nenter into the frost problem as an element of no mean value.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked: How do these masses of water affect the frost?\r\nScience answers: By their evaporated moisture influencing the\r\natmosphere. This may save us from the blighting influence of frost, by\r\nenveloping the frozen vegetation in a wet blanket of fog; enabling it\r\nto be thawed in the dark, as it were, by which we avoid the influence\r\nof a bright sunshine, that would have destroyed the tissues had they\r\nbeen suddenly exposed to it when frozen. An equally important result\r\nis derived from the direct influence of the humidity of the\r\natmosphere, which modifies the temperature remarkably, as in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of large bodies of water. Insular situations\r\nespecially, even when low, are known to have a more genial climate in\r\nconsequence of this condition of the atmosphere, which depends upon\r\nthe large amount of caloric that is present in the latent form, in the\r\nvapor, and which becomes sensible heat as fast as the moisture is\r\ncondensed; as well as by the sensible caloric, the absolute warmth of\r\nthe water, affecting the temperature of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that very opposite situations, in regard to mere elevation,\r\nmay both be recommended for orchards; but the latter are the exceptions\r\nrather than the rule, for we can not always count upon the saving\r\ninfluence of a fog, nor are the modifying effects of a moderate sheet of\r\nwater always to be depended upon at the time when most needed. Still, we\r\nmay find a few favored spots, where an insular position, in a lacustrine\r\nsituation, receives a double influence--acting at both extremities of\r\nthe season of vegetation, in quite an opposite way, but in both acting\r\nfavorably. In such places we shall discover that the spring opens late,\r\nbeing retarded by the cold atmosphere flowing over the chilled waters,\r\nthat may be even icy, when inland places in the same latitude are\r\nrejoicing in a mild and genial temperature, tempting the expansion of\r\nthe flower-buds. Vegetation on an island thus situated is retarded until\r\nall danger of frost has passed, and the air has received the full\r\nbenefit of warmth from the water. Then, again, in the autumn, when we\r\nare in danger from the access of an early frost, such as sometimes,\r\nnorth of latitude forty degrees, destroys the whole crop of corn, almost\r\nuniversally, over hundreds of miles, these favored spots have really a\r\nwarmer atmosphere, from the influence of a great extent of water, that\r\nhas enjoyed a summer's sunshine, and which warms the air by giving off\r\nits heat very steadily, but slowly; and besides, as the surface of the\r\nland cools by radiation and condenses the watery vapor, it receives\r\naccessions of temperature that had been locked up, or was insensible in\r\nthe vapor. Hence we find that in these places, though the opening of\r\nspring was retarded a month, the approach of winter and autumnal frosts\r\nis warded off for two months, making the season really one month longer\r\nthan in the same latitude inland.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, however, that the subject of meteorology is not\r\nfully understood. We have but a glimmering of the light that we hope\r\nis to be shed upon the subject when the deductions from millions of\r\nobservations, long continued and systematically conducted, shall have\r\nbeen wrought out for the benefit of the orchardist and the general\r\nagriculturist.\r\n\r\nWe also have storms accompanied by a low temperature, passing across\r\nthe country, in which, at times, the greatest intensity of cold is at\r\nthe southern border. Such a one passed from the west to the east in\r\nJanuary, 1852, in which the mercury, near Marietta, O., sank to thirty\r\ndegrees below zero; at Zanesville, O., on the same river, it was\r\ntwenty-seven degrees; at Lancaster, O., thirty-two degrees; while at\r\nCleveland, O., it was only fifteen degrees below, and at Aurora, on\r\nCayuga Lake, N.Y., influenced by the unfrozen water, its greatest\r\ndepression was only four degrees below zero.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nASPECT.--When considering the orchard site, the best _aspect_ of the\r\nground becomes a matter of interesting inquiry. To all vegetation, the\r\nmorning sun is a welcome visitant after the night's repose; for\r\nplants, as well as animals, rest from their functions at night, and\r\nall nature rejoices in the return of day; hence an eastern or a\r\nsoutheastern exposure is generally preferred, but we find that\r\npractically there is little difference in the different parts of an\r\norchard that can be fairly referred to this cause. Some planters\r\nprefer a southern slope, thinking that the fullest exposure to the sun\r\nis essential; others select a northern aspect, in the hope that they\r\nmay there avoid a too early excitation of vegetable life, and also\r\nthat the heats of summer may be thus moderated. In my own opinion, the\r\naspect is a matter of little consequence to the success of an orchard,\r\nthough my predilections are in favor of an easterly exposure. The\r\ndanger of a southern aspect in summer, and the advantages of the\r\nnorthern slope, may, in a great degree, be obtained or obviated by\r\njudicious planting and pruning, as will be set forth in another place.\r\n\r\nA theory has been started by those who are opposed to a northerly\r\nslope, that vegetation continues later in the season in such\r\nsituations, especially with young trees, and that hence they are not\r\nin so good a condition to resist the access of very severe weather at\r\nthe sudden setting in of winter. The hypothesis is not sustained by\r\nlong-continued observation, although many facts noted in the autumn\r\nand winter of 1859 induced persons to embrace the theory; these were\r\nparticularly the killing of the peach-buds, upon northern slopes, by\r\nthe December frosts. There is no evidence that there was any want of\r\nperfect ripening of the wood in these situations; on the contrary, it\r\nis well known that, long before December, the growth of these very\r\ntrees had been checked, the wood had been well ripened, and the\r\nfoliage had been cast to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe warmer exposure of a southern slope may, and often does, favor the\r\npremature swelling of the buds and starting of the sap during mild,\r\npleasant, and bright weather in the winter, and vegetation is often\r\nseriously injured from this cause.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country, it is much more important to consider\r\nthe exposure to the prevailing winds of the region, and to select the\r\nsite and aspect that shall enjoy the benefit of protection. This, I am\r\naware, is a proposition that has had opponents; as well as advocates,\r\nin the broad savannas of the West, where, especially, it becomes a\r\nquestion of the greatest importance. There are benefits as well as\r\nevils attendant upon the motions of the atmosphere. The swaying of the\r\nlimbs, when agitated by the breeze, gives them tone and strength, and\r\nmay assist in the circulation of the sap within their cells; and the\r\nconstant agitation of the atmosphere, commingling the warmer with the\r\ncolder portions, will often modify the temperature to such an extent\r\nas to give an immunity from the frost in the open prairie, at the same\r\nmoment that the more tranquil air, within a limited clearing of forest\r\nlands, has been cooled down, by radiation, to the frost point. On\r\nevery account, therefore, the moderate and reasonable exposure to the\r\ninfluences of a mobile atmosphere is rather to be courted than\r\nshunned.\r\n\r\nThe views that have been advanced by the advocates of protection for\r\norchards on the prairies, have been somewhat modified since they were\r\nfirst promulgated. We are now told, by those who have opposed\r\n\"protection,\" that narrow timber-belts of evergreens and deciduous\r\ntrees, should be planted on the windward sides of orchards, to\r\nmoderate, not to cut off, the aerial currents; in this all will agree,\r\nand those who have any sympathy for a tree will surely prefer to have\r\nthe blasts, that sweep over miles of open country, somewhat checked\r\nand tempered before reaching either themselves or their orchards. The\r\ntestimony as to the effects of cold in sheltered and in exposed\r\nsituations, it must be confessed, appears somewhat contradictory; but\r\nthis is because we have not all the elements of a complex problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER-KILLING.--A most serious evil, both to the nurseryman and\r\norchardist, is the severe injury sometimes done to the trees by frost.\r\nThis is commonly known by the term \"winter-killing,\" which has, at\r\ntimes, destroyed millions of trees, and thus blighted the hopes of\r\nlong-continued labor and large investments of capital. Some\r\norchardists have been disheartened, and have given up in despair. The\r\ninvestigation of the causes of this disaster, and the conditions under\r\nwhich it occurs, will be of great value to future planters; and\r\nthough, perhaps, we have not yet at command sufficient data for the\r\nfull explanation of the phenomenon, it may be well to look into the\r\nattendant circumstances that have been observed; and as some of the\r\nmost important considerations depend upon the soil and exposure, they\r\nmay be well introduced in this place.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the theory, that the north hillsides\r\nmaintain a later growth than other situations, and have stated that\r\nthe facts do not sustain the position. The warm exposures on southern\r\nslopes and sheltered nooks, are apt to favor the premature starting of\r\nthe sap in the mild weather that often occurs during the winter, in\r\nour changeable climate. On the prairies, and on flat lands elsewhere,\r\nan excess of humidity in the soil will contribute to this disaster;\r\nand in such situations we may often observe the most terrible\r\ndestruction following a great and sudden change of temperature.\r\nExposure to long-continued cold, with severe winds, seems to dry up\r\nthe juices of the plants, in some instances, and thus effect their\r\ndestruction. This, in the far North, is believed to be a frequent\r\ncause of the evil. The condition of the tree upon the access of severe\r\ncold is too important a subject to be lost sight of, and has already\r\nbeen alluded to.\r\n\r\nOf any given variety, the more perfectly dormant the plant, and the\r\nmore complete its condition of hybernation, the greater will be its\r\nimmunity from this evil. The atmospheric changes and conditions we can\r\nnot control, and we can modify them only in a very limited degree, by\r\nhedges, by timber-belts, and by evergreen screens, the value of which\r\nbegins to be appreciated. The state of the soil, as to its moisture,\r\nis under our control, and by thorough and surface-drainage, we may\r\nobviate one very important condition that conduces largely to the\r\ninjury under consideration--the excess of moisture in and upon the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe more perfect ripening of the wood, is likewise a matter of great\r\nmoment, and this is also subject to our control, particularly in young\r\ntrees in the nursery and orchard.\r\n\r\nCertain varieties are much more subject to injury from cold than\r\nothers. Among these are some of the most thrifty and free growing\r\nsorts. There appears to be an inherent quality of hardiness in others,\r\nthat enables them to resist the most trying alternations of\r\ntemperature. Why some should be thus hardy, and others tender, we do\r\nnot know, but it is not their Northern or Southern origin; some having\r\nthe former are most tender. Sad experience has taught us the fact, and\r\nsince the dreadful winters of the past decade, in some parts of the\r\nWest, the first question asked, respecting a new variety of fruit, is\r\nthat regarding its hardiness. Pomological societies have endeavored to\r\ncollate the names of the hardy and tender kinds, and have thus, by\r\ntheir united experience, been enabled to present lists of a few of the\r\nknown hardy apples, for the guidance of planters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS.--It will be proper, in this place, to say something about the\r\nsoils best adapted to orcharding. The apple is a gross feeder, but a\r\ngood-natured one, and, like a good citizen and a cosmopolite, it\r\nsubmits to surrounding circumstances. In our own country, it\r\nflourishes alike on the granite hills of New England, or the mountain\r\nranges stretching thence to the southwest, in the limestone valleys\r\namid these ridges, on the sandstones and shales that form the\r\nsoutheastern rim of the great valley of the West, upon the vast drift\r\nformations that overlie the rocks from the tide-waters of the St.\r\nLawrence to the sources of the Missouri, upon the rich diluvial and\r\nalluvial deposits of our river bottoms, and our vast prairies. I have\r\nsaid that the apple flourishes _alike_ upon these various soils and\r\nunder these so different circumstances; perhaps this expression should\r\nbe somewhat modified; there are varieties that appear peculiarly\r\nadapted by their nature for all of these different situations; there\r\nare, perhaps, none that will thrive equally well in all.\r\n\r\nThe orchardists of each section of the country must ascertain for\r\nthemselves what varieties are best adapted to the peculiarities of\r\ntheir soil and climate; hence, no one region can furnish lists of\r\nvarieties to be taken as a guide for the planting of others\r\ndifferently situated. Hence, too, the importance of local\r\norganizations for pomological study, and the great value of the labors\r\nof those who are engaged in the prosecution of these investigations in\r\nthe American Pomological Society, which will, it is fondly hoped,\r\nultimately give us corrected lists of fruits that are adapted to all\r\nthe varying circumstances of soil and climate, in each of the great\r\ngeological regions of our country. This has already been proposed by\r\nthe excellent general chairman of Fruit Committees, as an important\r\nwork for the National Society; and so soon as the subject receives a\r\nfair consideration, its merits will be appreciated, and a union of the\r\nbest minds, and the best experience of the pomologists of each\r\ndistrict, will be concentrated upon this labor.\r\n\r\nLet me not be misapprehended in the statement, just made, with regard\r\nto the wide distribution of which the apple appears to be capable.\r\nThere are soils and situations, in all of the widely-separated regions\r\nalluded to, that are wholly unfitted to orchard culture, upon which it\r\nwere folly to plant an apple-tree; and yet, many of those may be\r\nrendered entirely suitable, if subjected to treatment, suggested by\r\nscience, and executed by human ingenuity and industry; the missing\r\nelement may be supplied, the compactness of the soil may be overcome\r\nby mechanical comminution, and by that effected by aeration; the\r\nexcessive moisture may be removed by surface and thorough drainage;\r\nother disqualifications, such as those of situation and climate, may\r\nnot be so readily overcome; they have already been alluded to; and\r\neven in them we may hope for improvement with the advance of science.\r\n\r\nDifferent soils may be designated as porous and compact. Leaving out\r\nof view for the present, their chemical composition, let us look to\r\ntheir mechanical structure. Porous soils are composed of materials\r\nthat always allow of the escape of superabundant moisture; they are\r\ngenerally underlaid by beds of diluvial gravels, or by rocks of a\r\nporous character. Such lands are peculiarly adapted to orchard\r\nplanting. The compact soil, on the contrary, is made up of the finest\r\nmaterials, among which alumina largely predominates. Such are called\r\nclayey soils or clays, and are among the most valuable upon the\r\nsurface of the earth, not because alumina is a component of\r\nvegetation, but because the elements associated with it, are all of\r\nthem in a state of extreme comminution.\r\n\r\nClays are compact soils, not only by reason of the fineness of their\r\nparticles, but because the predominating alumina swells and becomes\r\npasty when it is wet, and thus prevents the passage of water through\r\nthem. On this account, soils that are too compact, especially if they\r\nbe underlaid by stiff clay subsoils, are not so well adapted to\r\norcharding as those that are more porous. This is especially true of\r\nlevel lands, upon which water accumulates, to the great injury of the\r\nfruit-trees planted upon them; but even in hilly situations, with good\r\nnatural surface drainage, the excess of clay is indicated by a\r\n\"spouty\" condition of the surface. So many varieties succeed in clayey\r\nlands, however, and some are so superior in their products when\r\nplanted upon clays, that we need not be discouraged by this apparent\r\ndifficulty; it may be overcome by the ingenuity of the skillful\r\nfarmer. Thorough or under-drainage will remedy all the evils of clay\r\nsoils, and bring out their superior advantages. This will be more\r\nfully explained in another place. Much may be done toward removing the\r\nredundant moisture, even in the flat clay lands of the prairies and\r\nother extended plateaus, by the simple means of ridging up the lands\r\nwith the plow. What is familiarly called \"back-furrowing\" enables the\r\nplowman to raise a ridge upon which to plant his trees, and at the\r\nsame time he opens a furrow for the escape of surface water. While a\r\nportion of the redundant moisture is thus removed, another great\r\nobject of drainage is not attained: I allude to the aeration of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said upon a previous page, it might be inferred,\r\nthat as the apple may be cultivated upon soils of such great diversity\r\nas those that occur over the range of territory indicated, as well as\r\nupon the western coast of this continent, and in the temperate regions\r\nof the Old World, the peculiar soils that are characterized by their\r\nunderlying rocks would be equally acceptable, whether these were\r\ngranites, shales, sandstones, or limestones. Such is not the fact,\r\nhowever, and we have found, in this utilitarian age, that geology has\r\nmuch to do with the planting of an orchard. There are varieties that\r\nsucceed better upon one rock than upon another, and there are those\r\nthat fail to be remunerative when transplanted to a rock, which to\r\nthem is obnoxious, though it may be a very paradise to other\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese observations are becoming a matter of great importance to\r\norchardists, and we may hope that the study of this subject will be\r\ndeveloped into some certain data, and that the future discussions of\r\nour pomological societies will furnish reliable information to orchard\r\nplanters.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] See Lawrence Young's Experiments, in _Western Horticultural\r\nReview_, Vol. I. page 190, in Report of Kentucky State Fruit Committee\r\nto American Pomological Congress, for 1850.\r\n\r\n[20] Western Horticultural Review; also, Statistics of Storm, Jan. 1,\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF THE SOIL FOR AN ORCHARD.\r\n\r\n  DRAINAGE.

Good results, fair crops amply\r\nremunerating all outlay, often follow the most careless or almost\r\naccidental orchard planting; but trees that are properly set, in\r\nwell-prepared land, upon a judiciously selected orchard site, and for\r\na few years subjected to proper culture, are infinitely more\r\nsatisfactory in their results, and much more profitable to their\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nThe importance of drainage can not be too often reiterated, not merely\r\nfor the sake of leading away the excess of water that at some seasons\r\nprevails in much of our best lands, but on account of the more\r\nthorough admission of the beneficial air to the soil and the roots;\r\nthis, of course, can only be had by thorough under-draining of the\r\nland. Spouty or springy land is not to be selected for an orchard, and\r\nyet we often find spots of this character in fields that we wish to\r\nappropriate to orcharding; these should certainly be drained.\r\n\r\nMere surface drainage may be cheaply effected by the plow, and should\r\nalways be done in level lands, especially where the subsoil is compact\r\nand tenacious. The expense of thorough drainage is so great, and the\r\nsuccess of our orchards, as commonly planted, even on ill-prepared\r\nground, is so generally good, that we can not expect the majority of\r\nfarmers to use drain tile at present. Still, the importance of\r\ndraining can not be doubted: the best results follow its use, and he\r\nwho would reap the best harvests, and attain the highest success, will\r\nunderdrain his land. For the most of us, surface drainage alone, is\r\nall that we can do; this should never be neglected, for no crop can be\r\nsuccessful in land that is subject to an occasional drenching with a\r\nsurplus of water that stands for days, filling it to the surface,\r\ncausing the fermentation and souring of the organic matter it\r\ncontains. The fruit tree, certainly, will not thrive in such a\r\nsituation, and is as sure to fall into a decline, or consumption, if\r\ncondemned to wet feet, as would a delicate girl under similar\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nThe expense of under-draining is the only objection that can possibly\r\nbe urged against it; even this is no real objection, for it has been\r\nrepeatedly proved that the outlay, whatever it be, insures such\r\nincrease of crops as to pay a good interest upon the investment,\r\nexcept where the natural under-drainage of the soil, by a porous\r\nstratum of rock or gravel, already provides a ready discharge of the\r\nsuperabundant water. It is thus only a question of the cash capital to\r\nbe invested in the business, for most of our orchard sites are of such\r\na character of soil as to be immensely benefited by the process. With\r\nmany of us, in this country, the capital is not to be had, or can not\r\nbe spared, to put underground; our means are limited, and we do not\r\ndrain our farms, as we should.\r\n\r\nSurface drainage may be more cheaply effected, and, on land at all\r\nflat and retentive of moisture, it should never be neglected. It may\r\nbe done while preparing the soil for planting--done with the plow. It\r\nhas already been premised that the orchard site should be elevated;\r\nsuch land is generally somewhat undulating; indeed, the flattest field\r\nthat should ever be planted, will always present some inequalities of\r\nsurface. Let these be noted before laying off the lands for the plow;\r\ncalculate to have the furrows cross these inequalities of surface, and\r\ngather the furrows in narrow lands, lapping them together just where\r\nthe row of trees is to be placed. This process may be repeated, and\r\nthus quite a ridge will be thrown up for the trees, and a\r\ncorresponding depression will be left in the middle of the space\r\nbetween the rows, which will serve as a gutter to carry off an excess\r\nof surface water; thus, a cheap method of superficial drainage may be\r\neffected by the mere plowing of the land judiciously; and this will be\r\nfound of great advantage in level lands with a stiff subsoil. When\r\nsuch fields are selected for the orchard, this plan should always be\r\npursued; nor does it preclude the subsequent use of tile, which is the\r\nbest draining material, at any period afterward. These gutters being\r\nat a distance from the tree rows, can be deepened, and the tile laid,\r\nwithout disturbing the roots; or the mole drain plow may be drawn\r\nthrough these furrows, if the subsoil be of a suitably tenacious\r\ncharacter to admit of the use of this implement.\r\n\r\nVery satisfactory preparation of the soil is done with the plow and a\r\ngood team; indeed, except for the limited surface of a small fruit\r\ngarden, no other and no better implement need be desired. With it we\r\ncan produce a very thorough disintegration and perfect subversion of\r\nthe soil; these are the objects we have in view. But here we have a\r\nchoice of instruments, in which we must be guided by the character of\r\nthe soil to be dealt with. If this be shallow, or thin, and underlaid\r\nby a sterile subsoil that would be unfit for the surface, we must plow\r\nmore shallow, but there are few sites, in the Western country, where\r\nwe do not find a sufficient depth of soil to satisfy the most thorough\r\nplowman, and beneath it a subsoil that will be benefited by aeration,\r\nand which will become good surface soil if subjected to the influences\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe have few soils that may not be trenched with the plow or spade to\r\nany depth that is attainable. And here let me explain what is meant by\r\n_trenching_: it is the transposition of two layers of the soil more\r\nthoroughly, and to a greater depth, than is done by simply digging or\r\nplowing, in which a limited amount, only a thin layer of the soil, is\r\ninverted. In trenching with the spade, a narrow strip of land is\r\nexcavated across one end of the piece to be trenched, eighteen or\r\ntwenty inches wide, and as deep as the spade can take it out at two\r\ndiggings. The earth thus removed is thrown aside, to be used at the\r\nend of the work. The trench being now open, a similar space is laid\r\noff, and the surface soil, to the depth of the spade, is dug and\r\nthrown into the bottom of the first trench, after which the subsoil is\r\ndug to the same depth, the length of the space, and thrown on top of\r\nthe surface soil that was put into the bottom of the first trench. A\r\nsecond trench is thus opened, and a third strip being then marked off,\r\nthe same processes are continued, until the whole piece is trenched,\r\nwhen the pile of earth first excavated is brought into requisition to\r\ncomplete the work, by filling up the last trench. This is common\r\ntrenching, which reverses the two layers of soil, and stirs the whole\r\nto the depth of eighteen or twenty inches. It is an expensive\r\noperation, but very desirable in a small fruit-garden--not at all\r\napplicable for extensive orchard planting, though often applied to the\r\npreparation of extensive vineyards.\r\n\r\nTrench plowing is conducted upon the same principle, and is done by\r\nusing two plows in the same furrow, the first taking off the surface\r\nsoil and throwing it into the deep furrow of the second plow, which is\r\nso constructed as to lift the lower soil and throw it high up over the\r\nfurrow slice laid by the first, and at the same time, leaving a deep\r\nfurrow open behind it to receive the next cut of surface soil. The\r\ntwo layers are thus inverted and reversed at the same time, and with a\r\nproper plow, the whole soil is finely comminuted and reduced to a\r\nperfect seed-bed, suitable for a garden. To perform this work, the\r\nDouble Michigan plow is the favorite implement. It should be properly\r\nconstructed, for much depends upon having the plow well made; the\r\nmold-boards should be formed upon the best models for their respective\r\noffices of reversing the surface soil, and of upheaving and\r\ncomminuting that which lies below it; and these mold-boards should be\r\nmade of steel. Such plows are manufactured at several points, but all\r\nthe Double Michigan patterns are not equally good, and some are quite\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe Deep Tiller plows will do very good work in certain soils, and may\r\noften be used to advantage in the preparation of the orchard grounds,\r\neither alone, or to follow another plow when trench plowing is\r\ndesired, and the trench plow is not at hand. These plows, as made at\r\nMoline, Illinois, are much used, and give great satisfaction in that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nSubsoiling is a very useful addendum to deep plowing; its object is to\r\nstir the deep layers of the soil without bringing the earth to the\r\nsurface. This aerates and loosens the subsoil, and thus effects the\r\ncombined objects of increasing the fertility of the land, of retaining\r\nmoisture for the crops, and, to a certain extent, of allowing any\r\nexcess of moisture to percolate away. Subsoiling is most efficacious\r\nwhen combined with draining, but it is of great use without, unless\r\nwhere permanent water is found near the surface. There is a great\r\nimprovement in the subsoil plows. Those first made were provided with\r\na share on one side, and this wing, as it was called, was tilted up\r\nseveral inches, thus increasing the draft unnecessarily. We now use a\r\nsharp steel share, of diamond shape, cutting on both edges, right and\r\nleft, and very slightly elevated in the centre, only two inches, or\r\ntwo and a half at the most. If the soil is stirred with this\r\nimplement, the hard earth at the bottom of the furrow, made by the\r\nturning plow, is thoroughly broken up, and it does not fall directly\r\nback into its place, but the crumbled portions support one another,\r\nand the furrow appears to be filled with loose earth. The result is\r\nastonishing, when we consider the flat, diamond-shaped plow sole that\r\nhas done the work.\r\n\r\nThe depth to which this implement may be made to disintegrate the\r\nsoil, depends upon its strength, the power of the team, and the\r\ncharacter of the subsoil. I have seen it tear up several inches of the\r\nshales and other rocks, and aid in making a good soil of them. I have\r\nseen it sink to the beam in the alluvium of our river bottoms, and I\r\nhave seen it almost refuse to do its office in some of the hard white\r\nclay subsoils, when drawn by a heavy team, while in more yielding but\r\ntenacious clays I have seen it trembling under the strain of three\r\nyoke of good cattle, that were scarcely able to pull it through the\r\nadhesive soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURING.--The importance of the application of manures to the\r\norchard, as a part of the preparation of the soil, will depend\r\nentirely upon its strength and condition. Trees are great feeders;\r\nthey need a reasonably fertile soil, for though their roots run wide\r\nand deep, in search of nourishment, if the necessary food be not in\r\nthe soil, they will certainly fail to thrive as they should. The\r\nanalysis of the ashes of our fruit trees, which contain the elements\r\nthey have derived from the soils on which they grew, enables us to\r\nascertain what kinds of plant-food should be present in the soil we\r\nare about to use, or what materials we may safely and judiciously add\r\nto it as manures. Lime, and the alkalies, are generally safe and\r\nuseful additions, in connection with clover as a green manure; these\r\nmay be applied to almost any worn soils with great advantage. Clover\r\nis an invaluable assistant. Its long roots pierce deeply into the\r\nsoil, bringing up from below hidden treasures, which are left in the\r\nupper layers, modified by the digestion of the plant, and by new\r\nchemical changes and combinations, rendered fit food for succeeding\r\ncrops. The mere disintegration of the soil produced by the roots of\r\nclover, is, in itself, a valuable mechanical preparation, quietly\r\nperformed, without plow or team. The clover lea may be limed with\r\ngreat advantage; an application of twenty-five to fifty bushels of\r\nslacked lime to the acre will improve the growth of clover, and will\r\nexert its appropriate influence upon the soil, with very happy results\r\nfor the succeeding crop of orchard trees. Alkalies may be applied, in\r\nthe form of wood ashes, either at the preparation of the soil, or at\r\nany subsequent period, as may be found most convenient. Stable manure,\r\nand composts, will seldom be required in lands that have not been\r\nnearly exhausted, and therefore unfit for an orchard. In case it\r\nbecomes necessary to use such a field, the manuring should be done all\r\nover the surface, and a crop of clover should be grown and plowed in\r\nbefore planting the trees; upon no account should fresh stable manure\r\nbe brought into immediate contact or close proximity with the roots\r\nof the young tree. If the necessity for planting on such a piece of\r\nland impel immediate action, very thoroughly decomposed composts may\r\nbe applied, mixed with the soil about the tree, but successive\r\napplications of manures will be needed over the entire surface, for\r\nthe roots are destined to occupy the whole extent of soil between the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the preparation is the digging of the holes for\r\nplanting the trees. Some persons lay great stress upon the importance\r\nof having these made large and deep, which may be very well in a grass\r\nlawn with a few trees, but it is a very expensive matter for the\r\norchard of thousands or even of hundreds. The holes should be prepared\r\nas wide as the field, and as deep as the plow can stir it, as already\r\ndirected; that is the kind of holes that should be dug; if the land\r\nhave been prepared in this manner, the opening of the holes and\r\nplanting the orchard, either deep or shallow, becomes a very simple\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the distance at which the trees shall stand from one\r\nanother, and the order or plan of planting, flag poles are to be set\r\nin the line to be occupied by the first row of trees, and a deep\r\nfurrow is then opened with a large plow, drawn by a pair of steady\r\nhorses. The poles are moved and set for the next row of trees, and so\r\non, until the whole is laid off, making the furrows as straight as\r\npossible. This done, a single horse with a lighter plow is driven\r\nacross these deep furrows at the proper distance, so that the\r\nintersections shall indicate the stations for the trees. Strong\r\nstakes, about four or five feet long, are then driven firmly at these\r\nintersections, and if the marking-out has been well done, they will\r\nrange in six directions--N. and S.--E. and W.--N.-E. and S.-W.--N.-W.\r\nand S.-E., or to corresponding points of the compass; for it is not a\r\nmatter of much consequence in what direction the rows of trees stand.\r\nThe holes are the deep furrows, and tree stations are the spaces\r\nbeside the stakes, always maintaining the same relative position\r\nthroughout the orchard; the northern side is to be preferred, on\r\naccount of the partial shade of the stake. By adopting this plan,\r\nthere need be no trouble, as is often experienced, in sighting the\r\ntrees to have them straight, for if the stakes have been correctly\r\nplaced, the trees will also be right, and will range in every\r\ndirection, when planted.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing the subject of stakes, let us understand their\r\nobject and function: it is not to tie up the trees, and to force them\r\nto attain an erect posture; no, that is not to be effected by staking,\r\nas will be set forth in another place. Rather than tie a tree to a\r\nstake, it were better to cut it down to the ground, and grow it over\r\nagain. The real objects of the stakes are, first, to show the planter\r\nwhere to set a tree; second, to show where the tree has been planted;\r\nthird, to indicate to the plowman and to his horse where to exercise\r\ncare in passing the infant tree during the first years' culture, for\r\nan intelligent animal will very soon learn what objects it is intended\r\nfor him to avoid injuring during his labors in the field; a fourth\r\nfunction of the stake is to ward off the single-tree which the\r\ncareless laborer may allow to strike the tree to its manifest injury,\r\ntearing the bark, and even breaking the stem. The passage of the wagon\r\nthrough the field will also be directed, by these stakes, to the\r\ninterspaces, instead of passing over the trees. Here are reasons\r\nenough for the use of stakes, but tying the trees to them is not among\r\nthe number; indeed, it might be called the abuse of the stakes rather\r\nthan their use, except in rare cases. Even in the windy prairie\r\ncountry, no stakes should be used, as supports, in a properly\r\nregulated orchard.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--MANNER OF STAKING A TREE.]\r\n\r\nWhen necessary to support a tree with stakes, after an injury or\r\naccident, the plan of C. Rosenstiel, Freeport, Ill., is the best I\r\nhave seen. He adopts it as a means of keeping his trees from being\r\ninclined by the wind. He drives a stake firmly into the ground, about\r\na foot to the southwest of his tree; a band of rye straw is cast about\r\nthe tree a few feet from the ground; the two ends are twisted and\r\nentwined together, forming a stiff rope from the tree to the stake,\r\nabout which it is then cast, and the ends are secured with a piece of\r\ntwine. By this appliance, the tree is maintained in an erect position\r\nwithout chafing; it can only yield to the wind by waving to the right\r\nor left; the band, by its tension, prevents it from leaving the stake,\r\nand, by its stiffness, holds it at a proper distance, and prevents its\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING comes next in order to the marking out, or hole-digging, for\r\nthese are synonymous; it should be done as soon as possible after the\r\nplow, on account of the fresh furrow with its mellow soil. It is\r\nreally a simple matter and upon this method may be executed with great\r\nrapidity. The trees now receive their necessary trimming, which\r\nconsists in a liberal shortening of the branches, a careful inspection\r\nof the roots, and a removal with a sharp knife of such as may have\r\nbeen bruised or torn, and cutting away any mat of fibres; after this,\r\nthey should be puddled, and then carried out to their stations by a\r\nboy. The planter follows; with a bright spade he removes any excess of\r\nsoil at the station, scraping away such portions of earth as he may\r\nfind in the way of the roots when the tree is placed by the stake. If\r\nthe furrow has not been recently made, it will be well always to\r\nremove a portion of the surface, so as to have fresh soil next the\r\nroots. The tree being placed near the stake, the roots are carefully\r\nspread out in their natural direction, and the moist mellow earth is\r\nfilled in among them, using the fingers when necessary, and gently\r\nshaking the tree so as to leave no empty cavities among the fibres.\r\nPretty firm pressure should now be made with the foot, especially upon\r\nthe fine earth placed above the ends of the roots; this excludes the\r\nair, by bringing the particles of soil in close proximity to the\r\nroots, ready to receive the new fibres that will soon be emitted from\r\nthem. It also secures the tree in its place better than tying to the\r\nstake, for each root acts as a guy rope. In this manner the work may\r\nprogress very rapidly, and, at the same time, may be well done. Some\r\nplanters always pour a liberal supply of water upon the mellow earth,\r\ninstead of pressing it with the foot. This will settle the fine soil\r\nabout the roots very effectually; fresh earth should always be thrown\r\non after the water, to prevent the surface from being caked and\r\ncracked.\r\n\r\nThe depth at which the tree should be planted is a question of\r\ninterest. Most authorities and most successful planters endeavor to\r\nregulate this, so that, when settled, the original collar of the young\r\ntree may be at the surface of the ground; deep planting has few\r\nadvocates. The position of the tree as to the points of the compass,\r\nis now believed to be a matter of very little moment, although there\r\nare still those who insist that the north side of the tree in the\r\nnursery row should be made to occupy the same position in the orchard.\r\nWith low-headed trees this can make no difference; no others are\r\nrecommended; on the contrary, if, unfortunately, none but tall trees\r\nwith naked stems can be procured, it is advised to cut them back\r\nseverely at planting time, so as to form a new head where wanted.\r\nThose who have not the heart to cut back a fine tree, may attempt and\r\nwill sometimes succeed in bringing out branches below, by nicking the\r\nbark with a large sharp pruning-knife, at several points along the\r\nstem, on all sides, but especially to the southwest, where the shelter\r\nof the branches is most needed. This, however, requires us to wait at\r\nleast one season, and that the most trying one to the young tree,\r\nduring which the naked bark is exposed to the sun and insects; and the\r\nwinds may add to the difficulty, by inclining the stem from the\r\nsouthwest. All this may be avoided by planting trees with low\r\nbranches, which are becoming more and more common as their merits are\r\nmore highly appreciated. Some of the most judicious planters,\r\nespecially in windy districts, have adopted the plan of inclining all\r\ntheir trees to the southwest at the time of planting, expecting thus\r\nto overcome the difficulty so commonly observed everywhere with tall\r\ntrees--their leaning to the northeast, and then becoming scorched and\r\ninjured by the frost and sun, and damaged by the borers.\r\n\r\nThe season for planting is a question of some importance, and must be\r\nsettled by the attendant circumstances. Fall planting has many\r\nadvocates and many advantages, but the fewest practice it. In the far\r\nnorth, with a long, trying winter approaching, it can not be\r\nrecommended; but, as the spring advances, there is a great press of\r\nwork; everything is to be done at once, and all is hurry; hence, for\r\nthe milder latitudes, with our charming autumnal weather, comparative\r\nleisure, and the soil in good condition, everything invites us to\r\nplant in the autumn, and with those south of latitude forty degrees,\r\nthe planting season will often continue until mid-winter. If we\r\ncommence this work before the fall of the leaves, care should be taken\r\nto strip these appendages from the trees in the nursery, before\r\ndigging them. Instead of leaving the soil about the tree at or a\r\nlittle above the general level, it should be heaped up in a little\r\nmound, which will shed off the rains, support the stem, and, to some\r\nextent, protect the roots from frost. This last suggestion is a matter\r\nof much importance, for one of the great advantages of autumnal\r\nplanting, depends upon the fact that, except in the most severe\r\nweather, the tree is not dormant--the hybernation is not complete; in\r\nmild weather there is some action in the buds and branches, and\r\nconsiderable activity exists in the roots; new fibres are emitted,\r\nand, with the first opening of spring, the young tree is ready for\r\nits summer's growth. Such is not the case with trees that have been\r\nbadly planted in the fall, in a wet, tenacious soil, where their roots\r\nhave been immersed in mud and water for months, and the swaying top\r\nhas strained them in every direction. For such a soil, draining is\r\nneeded; but, even then, the mound will be of material advantage in\r\nfall planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULCHING is a process about which much has been said and written, but\r\nof which, it is to be feared, very little is known and understood. The\r\nvery objects of mulching do not appear to be properly appreciated by\r\nmany persons. Its uses are two-fold: primarily, to keep the surface of\r\nthe earth moist by preventing evaporation, and to maintain that open,\r\nfriable condition we always find in the forest, under the natural\r\nmulching of the leaves. Mulching keeps the earth cooler in summer and\r\nwarmer in winter; the first, by shading from the burning rays of the\r\nsun, the second, by protecting from frost; the material itself, and\r\nthe confined air among it, being bad conductors of heat. Now, what\r\nmaterial shall we use for producing these results? Almost anything\r\nthat will fulfill these indications will answer--either stones, chips,\r\nboards, twigs, saw-dust, tan-bark, weeds, straw, either long or cut,\r\ncoarse manure, hay, freshly-cut grass, or, perhaps the very best for\r\nall the purposes of mulching, leaves themselves, except that they are\r\ndifficult to retain in their place. A combination of leaves and twigs,\r\nsmall branches or weeds, may be made to answer a very good purpose,\r\nfor winter mulching especially. For summer mulching there is another\r\nmaterial which has been found to answer an admirable purpose, though\r\nnot mentioned in the above list; it is mellow earth--yes, mellow earth\r\nadmirably fulfills most of the conditions of a good mulching material,\r\nbut it must be kept mellow by constant stirring. The air is thus\r\nadmitted, and deposits its moisture whenever the earth is cooler than\r\nthe atmosphere; the presence of the air among the particles of the\r\nsoil makes it a worse conductor of heat than when it is compacted\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nMulching the newly-planted trees is a very valuable application,\r\nwhether in summer or winter, and should be practiced wherever it is\r\npossible, always remembering that we can not well combine with it\r\nculture, which, for the summer treatment, is most essential to the\r\nsuccessful growth of trees, and in winter we shall present a harbor to\r\nthe mice if the mulch be placed too near the tree. He who may have\r\nbeen induced, by the recommendations of high authority, to plant an\r\norchard in a stiff blue-grass sod, or who may allow such sod to\r\nsurround his trees, in the belief that this constitutes a good mulch,\r\nwill be sadly disappointed; for, though the surface is shaded, the\r\ngrass will absorb the moisture from the soil at the expense of the\r\nyoung trees. Clover, on the contrary, makes a denser shade, and\r\nseeking its supplies more deeply, is less injurious, while its\r\nabundant broad foliage attracts ample supplies of dew to irrigate the\r\nsoil. In this respect it resembles the Indian corn, which is\r\nconsidered the best crop to put among young trees, as it produces\r\nshade, attracts the dew, and, more than all, it demands and receives\r\nthe thorough culture which the trees also require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND PLANTING.\r\n\r\n  IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIOUS SELECTION.

CONVENIENCE IN\r\n    HARVESTING TO HAVE EACH KIND GROUPED TOGETHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the consideration of a matter of great importance to\r\nthe success of the future orchard--the selection of the plants we are\r\nto set therein. No matter how favorable the site, how good the soil,\r\nnor how thorough the preparations may have been; all may be spoiled by\r\na bad selection of trees, and subsequent disappointment will be the\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nFormerly, and in some sections of the country even now, very erroneous\r\nnotions prevailed upon this subject. Large trees, of several years'\r\ngrowth in the nursery, were preferred by those who were planting\r\norchards: trees, ready to bear fruit, were eagerly inquired for, and\r\npreferred; even if they had been crowded together so as to be drawn up\r\nto a great hight without any lateral branches, and had formed their\r\nheads at the hight of seven or eight feet, so as to be out of the way\r\nof browsing by cattle and horses, they were the more admired by the\r\npurchasers. Now-a-days there is a great change in the sentiment of\r\ntree-planters as to the age, size, and shape of the trees that are to\r\nbe set out.\r\n\r\nThrifty young trees are preferred to older and larger ones on many\r\naccounts. They are more vigorous and will endure the disturbance of\r\ndigging, transportation, and change of locality from the nursery to\r\nthe orchard, much better than larger and older trees. They are more\r\neasily dug, and will have a larger proportion of roots removed with\r\nthem than those which have stood longer in the nursery-rows, so as to\r\nhave pushed their fibres beyond the reach of the spade. Such trees are\r\nmore stocky, and are furnished with lateral branches, or they should\r\nbe so furnished, but these would be smothered and removed from older\r\ntrees in crowded rows, as they are usually found in the nurseries. If\r\nthese younger trees be not already furnished with laterals and\r\nelements for the formation of low heads, by the judicious treatment of\r\nthe nurserymen who produced them, the orchardist can at least bend\r\nthem to his will. He may make of them just what he pleases by his own\r\nmanipulations at the time of planting or afterwards, without feeling\r\nthat he is sacrificing to his fancy and judgment the growth of two or\r\nthree years, by freely using the knife and saw, in the removal of the\r\nsurplus and overgrown top, leaving him only a bare and mutilated stock\r\nto set out at the beginning of his orchard.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of selecting small trees, especially to those at a\r\ndistance from the nursery, is, that they are so much more easily\r\ntransported, and freight bills are a serious item in the expense\r\naccount of a large orchard plantation--these may be reduced to a\r\nminimum by the selection of small instead of large trees. As to\r\nforming the heads of our trees, if we cannot get the nurserymen to do\r\nthis for us, since we are unwilling to remunerate them for the extra\r\nlabor, and greater space required to form such stocky specimens as we\r\nprefer, the difficulty is obviated by planting out young trees upon\r\nwhich we may form the heads where we please.\r\n\r\nAs already suggested, there is a great revolution going on in the\r\nminds of tree-planters as to the proper age for planting. Instead of\r\nthe inquiry for huge and cumbrous, overgrown trees, that had stood\r\nfour or five years or more in the nursery, we now find a growing\r\ndemand for small, stocky trees, of two or three years, or even less.\r\nOf many thriftily growing kinds, good yearlings are much better for\r\nthe orchard than large trees, especially such as have been crowded in\r\nthe nursery and are devoid of side branches, and whose tall naked\r\nstems are exposed to the burning heats and blasting cold of their new\r\nhomes in the open field, and to the depredations of hosts of insects.\r\nThose purchasers, who seek after the tall trees, with bare stems,\r\nrunning up like fishing poles, they who desire to buy their trees by\r\nthe running yard and to get as great a length as possible for their\r\nmoney, can be accommodated by the nurseryman, who will produce the\r\narticle to order; but such planters will soon find that their orchards\r\nare much less satisfactory than those set with short and stocky trees,\r\nand which have been encouraged to branch out so as to form low heads.\r\nAs set forth in the chapter upon _The Nursery_, such trees can be\r\nproduced, and they are greatly to be preferred on many accounts, but\r\ntheir production by the nurserymen must depend upon the intelligence\r\nof the orchardists producing a demand for trees of such a character,\r\nand a willingness on their part to pay the grower a liberal price for\r\nthe increased labor and expense, (in space at least), requisite for\r\ntheir production. This no one should object to, for there is economy\r\nin planting good trees; the successful orchardist will purchase the\r\nbest; he will not have the refuse or trash that may be offered him at\r\na low figure, for he well knows that it is dear at any price.\r\n\r\nWhere it is practicable and within reach, it is best for the planter\r\nto visit the nursery and make his own selection of the trees,\r\nespecially if the demand be for a limited number; but he may generally\r\ndepend upon the judgment and honesty of the nurseryman, if he has\r\ngiven his order distinctly as to the shape of the trees he desires to\r\npurchase. In a common nursery, he will often observe at the ends of\r\nthe rows, and where there may have been a gap or break in the\r\ncontinuous line of any variety, so that the trees are less crowded,\r\nsome trees that are better furnished with lateral branches, and are\r\nconsequently more stocky than where the rows are crowded. Here he\r\nwill be likely to find the specimens that suit his fancy, and he will\r\nmark them for removal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGGING.--At the proper season, and for most kinds this is at the fall\r\nof the leaf, the trees should be dug from the ground. This operation,\r\nas usually and necessarily conducted in large establishments, has to\r\nbe done expeditiously and with less care than the amateur will be\r\ndisposed to bestow upon this very important operation; and it\r\nsometimes happens that he will offer to pay the nurseryman a bonus for\r\nthe privilege of digging his own trees with his own hands.\r\n\r\nIn performing this operation he will be very careful to avoid\r\nmutilating the roots with the spade, or by using more force than is\r\nabsolutely necessary in lifting the loosened tree from its bed after\r\nthe roots have been pretty thoroughly liberated from the soil. He will\r\nfollow the directions given under this head in the appropriate section\r\nof the chapter on _The Nursery_. The importance of puddling the roots\r\nas soon as the trees are dug, cannot be too forcibly impressed upon\r\nthe planter and nurseryman; its value to the trees is so great as a\r\nprotection of the tender covering of the roots from exposure to the\r\nblighting influences of light, wind, and frost, that the trifling\r\nlabor and expense involved in the operation, should not receive a\r\nmoment's consideration.\r\n\r\nA puddle hole should be within convenient reach of the nursery-rows\r\nwhere the digging is in progress, and each sort should be taken to it\r\nas soon as dug. The excavation should be about a foot deep, or more,\r\nfor large plants, and as wide as is necessary to receive all the roots\r\nof the trees to be puddled. A plentiful supply of water should be at\r\nhand to put into the hole, and fine dry loamy soil should be sifted\r\ninto this, or simply thrown in from the shovel, and thoroughly mixed,\r\nso as to bring the fluid to the consistency of thick cream. Into this\r\nmud the roots are dipped, until every fibre is endued with a coating\r\nof the fine material; the trees then are ready for tying snugly\r\ntogether, and a little dry dirt may be sprinkled or sifted upon the\r\nroots while they are still wet, so as to give them a further\r\nprotection from the elements. They are then securely bound, each kind\r\nby itself, and each carefully labeled, if not already done; and as\r\nsoon as all are grouped together, they are ready for transportation to\r\ntheir new homes. If the distance be short, so that the trees may be\r\ncarried on the farm-wagon, no packing is used, unless the weather\r\nproves very inclement, but it is always safer to guard against both\r\nwind and sun, by covering the roots from their influence. For distant\r\ntransportation, too much care cannot be taken to have the trees well\r\npacked to protect the roots from drying and freezing.\r\n\r\nIn our uncertain climate, it not unfrequently happens that we receive\r\nan invoice of trees in the midst of a severe storm of cold, when the\r\nground is frozen hard, and we have reason to suppose that the roots in\r\nthe cases are frozen. This need not discourage nor alarm us, if the\r\npacking be good, for we have only to be patient and allow them time to\r\nthaw out thoroughly in the dark, and we shall find our trees all\r\nright. The packages should be placed at once in a dark cellar, and\r\nallowed to thaw gradually--if no such convenience be at hand, the\r\nboxes may be buried in the soil, or covered heavily with straw or hay,\r\nmaterials which are generally abundant in a prairie country, where\r\ncommodious cellar room is not always at command.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEELING-IN, as it is called, is a very important operation to be\r\nperformed so soon as possible after the receipt of the trees. It\r\nconsists in placing the fibrous roots in immediate and close contact\r\nwith the fresh and mellow soil, at some point convenient to the future\r\nplanting. A ditch is dug with the spade, or a deep furrow is opened\r\nwith the plow, in a sheltered, but elevated and dry situation, and in\r\nlight mellow soil; into this the trees are placed as fast as they are\r\nremoved from the packages, each kind being separated from the next by\r\na distinct marking stick, and it is well to place the labeled tree\r\nfirst, as taken from bundles when untied. The trees are inclined at an\r\nangle, generally leaning towards the south, so as to have the stems\r\nshaded by their own branches. They are carefully placed separately and\r\nheld in this position by one person, while the fine mellow earth is\r\nthrown upon the roots by another, who should take great care to see\r\nthat all the interstices are filled with soil, so as to exclude the\r\nair from the fibres. This is especially necessary where the trees are\r\nto remain in this situation during the winter, when they will be\r\nalternately frozen and thawed. To secure them from injury, the earth\r\nshould be banked up against them several inches; and it is well also\r\nto cover this with a heavy coating of leaves or some other mulching\r\nmaterial, if it can be safely used without danger of attracting the\r\nfield mice, which might ruin the trees. It is well at once to make a\r\nrecord of the trees as they stand, so soon as they are heeled-in,\r\nbeginning at one end of the ditches or rows, and pursuing a definite\r\norder. This record will prove of great value, and very convenient in\r\nselecting the different kinds at the time of planting, and will enable\r\nus to restore the names in case of accidental loss of labels during\r\nthe winter. The heeling-in of trees as they are received is\r\nrecommended, even if everything is ready for immediate planting,\r\nunless the number be very small; but if the weather and our\r\nconvenience permit us to place them at once in their permanent\r\nstations, the trees need not be heeled-in with so much care as when\r\nthey are to remain for a longer period.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that, from accident, detention by the way, bad\r\npacking, or exposure, we receive our trees in bad condition; they are\r\ndried, and the bark appears to be shriveled and shrunken--they seem to\r\nbe dead. Such trees may often be entirely restored by a little care,\r\nand will grow as well as any. The best treatment for such is to bury\r\nthem at once. Opening a sufficiently large trench, a layer of trees is\r\nplaced flat upon the bottom, fine mellow earth is sifted upon, and\r\namong their roots and branches, another layer of trees is spread down\r\nand covered in the same way, and so on until they are all secured,\r\nwhen they are left to quietly and slowly absorb the moisture from the\r\nsoil. In a few days they will be found to be well plumped, and will\r\nlook as fresh as ever, and should be exhumed, trimmed, and planted,\r\nselecting a moist or showery day for the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASON FOR PLANTING.--This topic has already been discussed, and the\r\nadvantages of fall planting have been presented: but it is well to\r\nbear in mind that there are reasons for preferring the spring, and for\r\nsome fruits the latter season is generally preferred.\r\n\r\nWhen planting an orchard in the fall, it has been recommended to raise\r\nan embankment of earth about the stem, for the double purpose of\r\nprotecting the roots from the frost, and also of preventing the action\r\nof the wind swaying the tree and straining the roots. A copious\r\nmulching is sometimes applied to keep out the frost, or at least to\r\nprevent the frequent thawing and freezing of the surface in our\r\nvariable winters; but whenever loose material is left near the base of\r\na young tree, we must expect damage from the mice, which are attracted\r\nand sheltered, and may commit sad devastations upon the bark before\r\nspring. The banking and mulching may be combined with advantage, and\r\nwith less danger from the mice, which only work under cover and are\r\noften more injurious upon older trees, surrounded with grass and weeds\r\nin neglected orchards, than upon those newly planted and mulched, if a\r\nlittle care has been taken to remove the straw or tramp it down near\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCE.--The distance between the trees is a matter that should be\r\ncarefully determined. Their habit should be considered, and their\r\nsize, when fully developed, must be studied. Some varieties will be\r\nmore crowded at forty feet apart, than others at fourteen. If\r\npossible, the larger and widely spreading sorts should be assorted\r\nand planted by themselves, and the more compact, upright and smaller\r\nones should be grouped together. It is difficult to do this, however,\r\nfor want of the necessary data; we can only make an approximation to\r\nthe desired result. Thus, the Yellow Bellflower, Summer Queen, Fall\r\nPippin, King of Tompkins County, Talman's Sweet, Golden Sweet,\r\nPennock, Northern Spy, and several others, are of the largest kind of\r\ntrees, and may be allowed as much as forty feet of space between them,\r\nwhile the upright character and moderate growth of the Lady, Bullock's\r\nPippin, Red June, Benoni, Early Joe, American Summer Pearmain, Summer\r\nRose, Red Astrachan, and others, of similar habit, would enable us to\r\ncrowd them into half as much space without serious injury--and there\r\nare trees of intermediate size and vigor, such as the Winesap, Rambo,\r\nGreening, Russet, Early Harvest, Fall Wine, Autumn Strawberry,\r\nHubbardston, Jonathan, and a host of others that, at the same ratio,\r\nshould have thirty feet spaces between them.\r\n\r\nThere is also a great diversity of opinion among orchardists as to the\r\nproper allowance of space for each tree, and many western planters are\r\nadvocates of close planting of the apple, which I have seen placed as\r\nnear as sixteen feet, occupying the whole space in a very few years,\r\nand bearing luxuriantly. The advocates of such crowding urge, that\r\nthey protect one another, and that alternate trees can easily be\r\nremoved whenever they become too much crowded. In other places, the\r\nold rule, of allowing two rods (33 feet), or even forty feet, between\r\nthe trees, is still followed and considered the best.\r\n\r\nA favorite method with some planters of fruits is, to make a\r\ncombination of different kinds in the same orchard, so as to have the\r\nwhole surface occupied from the first. In this way, by introducing a\r\ntemporary crop of another variety which will make speedy returns, and\r\nwill soon be ready to come away and make room for the permanent\r\nplantation, the ground may be rendered productive of remunerative\r\ncrops from the first. It is a very common plan to combine in this way\r\nthe apple and the peach--the latter come into bearing rapidly, and\r\nare generally ready to be removed by the time the apple trees need the\r\nwhole space. Alternate rows and alternate trees are usually planted\r\nwith peaches, and the small growing cherries, such as the Early May,\r\noften called the Early Richmond, can be planted in the same way. I\r\nhave seen a still further combination of fruits made by the\r\nintroduction of the raspberry, or even of the blackberry, the currant,\r\nand the gooseberry, in alternate rows, so that, by setting the apple\r\ntrees at forty feet, with alternating cherry trees, and the cherry\r\nrows in the middle space, or twenty feet each way from the apple and\r\ncherry rows, and in the intermediate strips of twenty feet the\r\nberries, which were also set between the trees, the whole ground was\r\nlaid off in rows of fruit separated by strips of ten feet wide.\r\nNothing is then needed for the full occupation of the ground, and to\r\nyield a return of fruit the next year, but to plant a single row of\r\nstrawberries in each of these ten feet spaces; these, if well treated,\r\nwould make four beds in the spaces between every two of the apple tree\r\nrows, or each ten feet, which is nearly half as much as would be\r\nplanted in the open field; and these would yield a half crop the next\r\nyear after planting, and as much the next season, when they should be\r\nplowed up to give cultivation to the berry bushes that would then also\r\nbear a crop of fruit, and continue to do so until the larger trees\r\nneeded the ground for their support. The peaches or cherries would\r\ncommence bearing the third or fourth year, and some of the apples\r\nwould follow quickly afterward, yielding partial crops. By such a\r\ncombination, as has been represented, the land is made to yield a\r\nsuccession of paying fruit crops from the second year of the\r\nfoundation of the orchard.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--DIAGRAM OF PLANTING QUINCUNX.]\r\n\r\nThe order of planting is a matter of some consequence, and should be\r\nsettled upon before commencing the work. The simplest form, and that\r\nmost usually adopted, is the square; furrows are drawn across the\r\nfield, at whatever distance the plants may be desired to stand, and\r\ncrossed by others equally distant and at right angles to the first.\r\nThese will, by their intersections, indicate the stations to be\r\noccupied by the trees. Some planters introduce a tree at the centre\r\npoint between each four, and this has been called _quincunx_, but\r\nerroneously--for the true _quincunx_ is constituted by one central\r\ntree surrounded by six, and all are equidistant, as illustrated by the\r\ndiagram, figure 26. This gives as many trees as possible upon the\r\nground, all equidistant, at twenty feet apart, or at any other\r\ndistance. It will be seen, that, in laying off this ground, whether\r\nwith the plow or simply with stakes to indicate the stations which\r\nthe trees are to occupy, we may first strike our furrows or set our\r\nsight poles, all in one direction, parallel, and at seventeen feet\r\nfour inches apart. Crossing these at right angles, we may draw\r\nparallel furrows every ten feet, and by setting our stakes at each\r\nalternate intersection of these furrows, the proper stations will be\r\nfound for planting trees in the true _quincunx_ order, in which every\r\ntree will occupy the corner of an equilateral triangle, and will be\r\nequidistant from six surrounding trees. If any one prefers to dig\r\nholes with the spade, instead of the more economical method proposed,\r\nby using the plow, the stakes may be set in parallel rows, in such a\r\nmanner, that in every alternate row the first stakes shall be advanced\r\none-half of the desired distance from the base line. It will be\r\ndesirable in this, as in every other system, to have a measuring-line\r\nat hand to prove the work from time to time, and make corrections;\r\nfor, otherwise, the most careful planter will soon get out of range.\r\nWhen the stakes are set properly, on level ground, they should range\r\ncorrectly in all directions. If the plantation be upon an uneven or\r\nhilly surface, it will be found almost impossible to lay off the\r\nground with absolute precision; but this is a matter of very little\r\nconsequence, as the growth of the trees will soon conceal any slight\r\ndefects, particularly if they be trained with low heads. In the small\r\nfruit garden greater precision is desirable, and should be attempted,\r\nbut in the commercial orchard, containing hundreds or thousands of\r\ntrees, such exactitude is scarcely attainable if it were desired.\r\nSometimes the aid of the civil engineer, with his instruments, is\r\ncalled in by the very precise planter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCULTURE, ETC.\r\n\r\n  THOROUGH CULTURE SHOULD FOLLOW THOROUGH PREPARATION.

POULTRY AND CURCULIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter, reference has been made to the necessity of\r\nthorough cultivation of the soil among young trees; but the importance\r\nof the proper attention to orchard culture is so great, that it\r\ndeserves separate consideration. The thorough preparation of the soil\r\nbefore committing the roots of our trees to its embraces, which was\r\nfully impressed upon the orchardist, might have induced some to think\r\nthat this was to be sufficient for them; but it ought rather to be\r\ninferred that any crop for which these preliminary labors were\r\nrecommended, should receive continuous attentions of a similar\r\ncharacter. It is with the desire that these views should obtain, and\r\nto indicate and specify, some of the most suitable modes of procedure,\r\nthat the following remarks are presented in this place.\r\n\r\nIf the ground, which has been appropriated to the orchard, be also\r\noccupied as farming land, as is usually done for a few years after\r\nplanting, while the trees are small, it should be exclusively devoted\r\nto hoed crops; by which is meant those that require constant\r\ncultivation and stirring of the soil. Indian corn is a favorite on\r\naccount of the thorough culture which is bestowed upon it, but there\r\nare some objectors to its use; by such it is considered too rank a\r\ngrower; it is thought to absorb too much of the moisture of the soil,\r\nand too greatly to over-shadow the young trees if they be so small as\r\nhas been recommended under the head of _Selection and Planting_. To\r\nthis objection, however, it is urged by others that the partial shade\r\nduring the latter part of summer is a benefit rather than an injury.\r\nIf the stalks be left standing upon the ground during the winter, they\r\nmodify the force of the winds, and may even be of benefit, by the\r\nprotection they furnish to the stems of the young trees; and when they\r\nfall to the ground, with their abundant foliage, these materials\r\nconstitute a winter mulching of considerable value. Even if the fodder\r\nhas been cut up, as is usually done by prudent farmers, the shocks\r\nscattered through the fields must exercise a considerable protecting\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nMelons, cucumbers, cabbages, potatoes, turnips, and other root crops,\r\nwhich require frequent cultivation, are preferred by some orchardists,\r\nbecause of their being lower, and thus they will shade only the\r\nsurface of the ground, without affecting the trees themselves. Let it\r\never be remembered, particularly in respect to soils that are of poor\r\nor of moderate fertility, that all these crops will remove their full\r\nshare of plant-food from the land that we have already appropriated to\r\nanother object, and that the main crop which we desire to draw its\r\nsustenance from the earth for a long series of years may thus be\r\nrobbed of its proper nourishment. Under such circumstances we must\r\nmeet the emergency by applications of fertilizing materials. I am\r\naware that it may be urged by the theorists of agriculture, that these\r\ncrops call upon the soil for different elements, and that, according\r\nto the customary views of the objects attained by a rotation, they may\r\neven be of advantage to those which are to follow. Others will make\r\nthe practical observation that the fertilizing materials of common use\r\nin modern agriculture, may so readily be applied to compensate for\r\nthese abstractions from the soil, that this is a matter of little\r\nmoment, and not worthy of serious consideration. But it should be\r\nobserved that, while men will often be induced to apply fertilizers to\r\nthe temporary crop, counting upon an immediate return for their\r\noutlay, they seldom feel willing to make any return to the soil in\r\ncompensation for what they have already removed from it, and rather\r\nwait until the necessity for such enrichment becomes painfully\r\napparent in the diminished productiveness of their fields.\r\n\r\nHoed crops, such as those above mentioned, should alone be allowed to\r\noccupy the space between the young trees, and on no account should\r\nany white straw crops, or grasses be introduced, at least for several\r\nyears, nor until the orchard shall have become well established. In\r\nmany species of fruits, it is undoubtedly better to keep up the\r\nsurface cultivation continuously, at least wherever the characters of\r\nthe site and soil will permit it; but there are many situations where\r\nthe abruptness of the declivities appropriated to fruit-growing, and\r\noften admirably adapted to such purpose, absolutely forbid continued\r\ncultivation. In such places it will be necessary soon to withdraw the\r\nplow, and to depend upon loosening the soil about the trees with the\r\nspade or fork, and upon the mellowing and meliorating effects of\r\nmulching. The expense of all the operations that are performed by\r\nhuman labor renders them inapplicable, except in small orchards and\r\ngardens; and in all large plantations we must depend upon the common\r\nearth-workers that are drawn by horses. Among these, a preference\r\nshould be given to such as stir and pulverize the soil near the\r\nsurface only; shallow culture of the upper layers of earth effects the\r\nobjects in view better than that which is deeper. The intruding weeds\r\nare subdued and a mellow condition of the earth is the result, while\r\nthe roots are not torn and bruised, but are encouraged to turn their\r\nfeeding fibres into the stratum of mellow soil above them. When the\r\ntrees have become well established, or when the nature of the soil and\r\nthe broken character of the surface of the orchard require it, we may\r\nseed down the ground with clover, which is preferred to any of the\r\ngrasses: the broad foliage will shade the ground, and may remain on\r\nthe surface as a mulch, or be moderately pastured by suitable stock.\r\n\r\nMulching the young orchard has some advantages over cultivation, but\r\nexcept in the proximity of the salt-marshes of the East, or near the\r\ngreat straw piles on the vast grain fields of the Western prairies, it\r\nis almost impossible to procure mulching materials for extensive\r\norchards; so that, unless we consider the clover and other legumes as\r\na living mulch, or grow such crops upon the land itself, to be used in\r\nthis way, we shall be thrown back upon culture of the surface, which,\r\nin the mellow soil thus produced, furnishes a most admirable mulching,\r\nthat fills all the indications, at least in the season when it is most\r\nneeded. This is a matter of the greatest importance, especially during\r\nthe first year after planting, when our trees so imperatively demand\r\nthe protection of a mulch; and it is found that when the usual\r\napplications of straw or similar material cannot be obtained, or are\r\nunsuitable for the situation, especial attention to the condition of\r\nthe upper layer of earth about the trees is of the greatest\r\nimportance; this should be kept thoroughly loosened and finely\r\ndisintegrated for the admission of air and moisture.\r\n\r\nMulching, even of an old and apparently exhausted orchard, has been\r\nfound to exercise a most happy effect upon its health and\r\nproductiveness. Such a one growing upon a tenacious clay, which had\r\nceased to yield any crops for years, was restored to abundant\r\nfruitfulness by covering the ground with a couple of inches of spent\r\nbark from an adjoining tannery, and similar effects have been produced\r\nby the application of straw, and of the bagasse from sorghum, where\r\nthose materials could be procured; but these were necessarily limited\r\nto a small number of trees, and they can never be adopted in the\r\ntreatment of large orchards. Fortunately, for us, however, in some\r\nkinds the trees themselves provide us shade for the ground, when they\r\nare properly trained and closely planted, which will prevent the\r\nintrusion of weeds and grasses, and the falling leaves and spray will\r\nalso yield a mulching of no mean value. Indeed, the trimmings from the\r\norchard, as well as the decaying foliage that annually falls to the\r\nground, belong to the soil, and might be left upon it with great\r\nadvantage to keep up its fertility by their decay, and even to\r\nincrease it, as they do in the natural forest, were it not for the\r\nslovenly appearance they produce.\r\n\r\nDr. Ward, of New Jersey, has practiced mulching rather extensively,\r\nand with excellent results. He uses salt hay from the marshes; after\r\nplowing the ground in the spring, he applies the mulching in a heavy\r\nlayer, which keeps down the weeds, preserves the moisture of the soil,\r\nand exerts a very happy influence upon the trees.\r\n\r\nFrom what has preceded, the reader may infer that the orchard is not\r\nto be used for a pasture field, and yet this is a very common\r\nappropriation of the inclosure that contains our fruit trees--at least\r\nafter they have attained sufficient size to be considered out of the\r\nway of serious injury. Let it not be supposed that the indiscriminate\r\npasturing of an orchard is advocated; on the contrary, it is wholly\r\ndeprecated, except as will be indicated below. All stock will trample\r\nand harden the soil. Low-headed trees will be sadly injured by live\r\nstock of all kinds. Horses and mules will often ruin the trees by\r\ndestroying the bark, and trimming off the twigs, as high as they can\r\nreach. Horned cattle will browse the spray, and where within reach\r\nthey will also break and twist branches of considerable size. Though\r\nmuch smaller, goats are entirely inadmissable, since they not only\r\ntrim off all the foliage within their reach, but they will also\r\ngreedily devour the bark from the trees, and thus commit sad havoc\r\namong them. Sheep, on the contrary, may often be introduced into an\r\norchard with advantage, as they will eat off a great many weeds, and\r\nthus clear the land of such intruders; but they will also spoil\r\nlow-headed young trees by eating all the leaves within their reach,\r\nand they should never be allowed access to the orchard in winter, at\r\nleast not while there are any trees remaining with smooth bark, as\r\nthey will often attack such and strip off all that they can get at:\r\nsheep are often very desirable in cider orchards when used to crop off\r\nthe herbage closely, just before the ripening and fall of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe only domestic animals which should ever be allowed free range in\r\nthe orchard, are swine, and the different sorts of poultry. All of\r\nthese will prove really useful in the destruction of vast numbers of\r\nthe insects that are particularly injurious to our cultivated fruits,\r\nand which are often enormously multiplied in our old orchards. Swine,\r\nit is true, will sometimes learn to climb small trees that have very\r\nlow branches, which they break off in their attempts to help\r\nthemselves to the fruit--this has been observed particularly in peach\r\nand cherry orchards. These animals are of use too as earth-workers,\r\nwhen they have not been mutilated, for with their peculiarly formed\r\nsnouts they will turn over a large extent of the surface, while in\r\npursuit of the larvæ and pupæ of many of the destructive insects, that\r\nin such stages of their existence occupy the soil beneath our fruit\r\ntrees; in this manner, swine are valuable adjuvants to the practical\r\nentomologist. The hog is a most useful scavenger, and also a great\r\neconomist in the orchard, for, being omnivorous, after feeding upon\r\nthe luxuriant herbage of the red clover, he takes his dessert from the\r\nfallen fruit, which, being defective, would otherwise be wasted: but\r\nwe must remember that most of these wind-falls are occupied by the\r\nlarvæ of insects which are thus put out of the way of doing further\r\nharm, while contributing variety to the porcine diet. The additions of\r\nmanure to the soil, which are distributed over the orchard by these\r\nanimals, are also found to be of service. Trees, which are frequented\r\nby swine, are generally healthy, and the bitter-rot is reported to\r\nhave disappeared from orchards that were badly affected with that\r\nmalady before the swine were admitted.\r\n\r\nThe advantages resulting from keeping both swine and poultry, but\r\nparticularly the latter, confined among plum trees, is a matter of\r\ngeneral notoriety; nor need we inquire whether this depends upon the\r\nfar-reaching instinct of the insect, which warns her against\r\ndepositing her eggs where the progeny must surely be destroyed, or\r\nupon the actual destruction of the larvæ by these animals, to such an\r\nextent as to diminish the number of depredators the following season.\r\nWe must not, however, depend upon these and other valuable aids, to\r\nthe exclusion of personal efforts, if we desire to secure good crops\r\nof the delicious fruits that usually fall a prey to their attacks.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the orchardist cannot be too strongly impressed with\r\nthe importance of cultivating his young trees in the most thorough\r\nmanner; nor can he exercise too much care in avoiding injury to the\r\nstems and roots, in practising this constant culture of the soil. In\r\ncollections of dwarf fruit trees, he will have less difficulty on this\r\nscore, because he will be restricted to hand-labor; but the spade and\r\nfork will be found much more expensive in their use than the plow and\r\ncultivator.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOWING UP OLD ORCHARDS.--A question frequently arises as to the best\r\ncourse to be pursued with an old neglected orchard, which has become\r\ncovered with a dense sod of grass, and this often of an inferior\r\ncharacter, and full of disagreeable weeds. Orchards that have been\r\nwidely planted, and which have gaps from the decay of trees,\r\nespecially when these have been trimmed up with high stems and long\r\nnaked branches, do not cast sufficient shade upon the ground to\r\nprevent the growth of grass and weeds. These intruders occupy the\r\nsurface soil to the disadvantage of the roots of the fruit trees, and\r\nwe may wonderfully improve the health of such orchard by plowing the\r\nground, and at the same time severely pruning the branches and\r\ncleansing the bark of these old trees. These good results may be\r\ncontinued by shallow culture of the soil, with suitable applications\r\nof manure where needed. By giving a dose of lime, or of marl, and\r\nashes, we shall infuse a new life and growth and productiveness that\r\nwill astonish and delight us, and reward us for our labors and outlay.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged as an objection to breaking up the sod, that the most\r\ncareful plowman will unavoidably damage some of the roots that\r\napproach the surface, but this is an injury that must be submitted to;\r\nand after all it is not such a serious affair, and is overbalanced by\r\nthe advantages of renewing the productiveness of the exhausted\r\norchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY OF PRUNING.\r\n\r\n  PRUNING, NATURE'S.

PRUNING OF THE GRAPE, SHORT AND LONG.\r\n    REASONS FOR AND OBJECTIONS TO EACH. SEASONS FOR PRUNING THE\r\n    VINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning is one of the most important operations that we perform upon\r\nplants,--especially woody plants. Pruning, in some sort, has to be\r\nperformed at all periods of their existence and growth, and upon all\r\nplants, from the noble forest tree, or the fruit trees of the orchard,\r\nof whatever kind, to the humble bushes and brambles that yield us\r\ntheir abundant and most welcome fruits: the trailing vine that adorns\r\nour arbors and covers our trellises with its rich and tempting\r\nclusters of grapes, also needs to be pruned. Many herbaceous plants\r\nare also submitted to judicious pruning, and yield in consequence an\r\nincreased product of fruit. Our ornamental gardeners and plant-growers\r\npractice pruning most admirably upon their house-plants, and by their\r\nsuccessful practice, they produce the most wonderful effects, which\r\nare manifested in the vigor, thrift, symmetry, and blossoming of their\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when we come to travel about the country, and to see the\r\nshrubberies, the parks, the orchards, fruit-gardens, and vineyards, as\r\nthey are, we shall be struck with the great amount of ignorance or\r\nneglect manifested by what we everywhere behold! Still more shall we\r\nbe surprised, when we hear nurserymen and orchardists, men who have\r\nhad opportunities for extended observation, and those too, who are\r\nconsidered successful cultivators, advocate the idea that trees should\r\nnot be pruned at all. An apology may be found for them in the many\r\ninstances of bad pruning that may frequently be met with. They may say\r\nthat no pruning is better than such mutilation, and with some\r\nvarieties of fruit, they may have a show of reason on their side, as\r\nthere are many sorts that will very naturally produce an open head,\r\nevery where provided with abundant fruit-spurs, which are the great\r\ndesiderata of the fruit-grower.\r\n\r\nWe prune our plants for the most opposite purposes; we prune to make\r\nthem assume some desired form, we prune to produce symmetry, and we\r\nprune to torture them as much as possible from their natural habit.\r\nAgain, we prune to make them grow vigorously, and we perform other\r\npruning operations, in order to dwarf and stunt our specimens, and to\r\nmake them as diminutive as possible. The experienced orchardist will\r\ntell you to prune a barren but thrifty tree, in order to make it\r\nproductive of fruit; and he will also tell you to _prune_ one that has\r\nexpended all its energies in fruit-bearing, and appears likely to\r\nexhaust itself to its own destruction. Upon very high authority,\r\nsupported by universal and annual practice, the vine dresser will tell\r\nyou to prune your vine in order to make it fruitful; the same\r\nauthority will advise you to prune in such a manner as to prevent an\r\nover-production--and he will insist that you shall prune again during\r\nthe season of growth, to promote the same objects.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the ends to be attained by this important\r\noperation are exceedingly diverse, and apparently contradictory: nor\r\nis it any wonder that the novice should feel bewildered in the midst\r\nof directions so opposite, nor even that those who have grown gray in\r\nthe orchard, should have arrived at the strange conclusions just\r\nmentioned, _not to prune at all_. And yet, notwithstanding these\r\napparent contradictions, there is a reason for each of these various\r\nmodes, as well as for the different seasons that have been recommended\r\nfor performing the several operations of pruning.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that in natural trees, whether standing alone in the\r\nmidst of a prairie, thinly grouped in the \"opening,\" or crowded\r\ntogether in the dense forest, we may behold the most perfect models of\r\nbeauty and fruitfulness; yet these have never been subjected to the\r\naction of the knife, the saw, nor the hatchet. True, and yet they\r\nhave all been pruned by _nature_. She prunes and trains magnificently,\r\nand gives us the finest models for imitation, whether for park\r\nscenery, as in the lone tree of the prairie, or in the scattered\r\ngroups of the island groves that are so often seen in the broad\r\nsavannas of the West, or in forests of noble shafts, gazed at with\r\nadmiration, then felled by the ruthless ax, and converted to man's\r\neconomic uses. She also shows us the pattern in the dense pineries,\r\nand other timber tracts of our country. All these have been pruned\r\ninto their present condition by the hand of nature. In the single\r\nspecimen, free access of air and light have enabled it to assume its\r\nfull proportions, developing itself on every side, and giving us the\r\ngrand and beautiful object we behold. The winds have tossed the\r\nbranches and some have been broken, the lower ones have quietly and\r\ngradually yielded to the smothering influence of those above them,\r\nwhich, in turn, have swept downward toward the ground. In the groves,\r\nthe scattering trees have for a while enjoyed the same opportunities\r\nfor development; but at length their branches have met together, and\r\ninterlocked in friendly embrace. Those that were nearest the ground\r\nhad already begun to suffer from the denser canopy above them but the\r\ngreat sturdy boughs that had shot upward so as to form a part of the\r\ncrown, were able to retain their vantage ground, and continue as\r\nimportant members of the trees. In these illustrations, we have seen\r\nmore of nature's training than of her pruning; but it must be\r\nremembered that training is one of the objects, and indeed, a leading\r\nelement of pruning, and is very properly a matter for our\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn the dense primeval forest we see nature's pruning exhibited upon a\r\ngrand and perfect scale; tall, straight, and noble trunks rise\r\nmajestically on every hand; not a twig nor limb breaks the symmetry of\r\nthe gradually tapering shafts, that are clothed in bark which does not\r\nindicate that they had ever been furnished with branches; and yet they\r\nhave borne branches from their base to their summit, and nature has so\r\nneatly removed them that we cannot detect the marks of her\r\npruning-saw. How this has been effected, may be seen in any dense\r\nthicket of young forest growth. It is simply a smothering of the lower\r\nbranches by those next above them, which has destroyed their vitality,\r\nand their decay has soon followed; while a new growth of branches at a\r\nhigher point, in turn, performs the same office of destruction upon\r\nthose next below them. As there is no outlet for the wood-growth but\r\nin an upward direction, upwards they must needs go, and as there is no\r\nlight nor air for lateral branches under such a canopy of shade, death\r\nand decay ensue, and down they perforce must come.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why we prune at all, it may be answered in general\r\nterms that in the orchard, our objects in performing this operation,\r\nare two-fold.\r\n\r\n1st--We prune for shape and comeliness, and for the removal of dead\r\nand dying branches, in aid of nature, but working in sympathy with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n2d--We prune for the sake of inducing fruitfulness.\r\n\r\nLet us consider some of the principles that are to guide us in these\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe first object, that of producing the desired shape of the future\r\ntree, is chiefly done upon the young subject, even in the\r\nnursery-row. The judicious pruner, being well aware of the upward\r\ntendency of young growth, and that this is increased by the crowded\r\ncondition of the trees in the nursery square, seeks to overcome the\r\nevil by proper pruning. If the growth be altogether upward, with no\r\nside branches the first season, the stem will be slender, often so\r\nmuch so as to bend over with its own weight. The wise nurseryman\r\ncarefully avoids disturbing the leaves or lateral branches, well\r\nknowing their importance in forming the woody trunk. At the proper\r\nseason he trims his trees down, instead of trimming them up--this he\r\ndoes by heading them back to the hight at which he desires them to\r\nform their branches--at the same time, he shortens in the laterals;\r\nhis object in both instances being to check the upward tendency of\r\ngrowth by removing the strong terminal buds, which would naturally\r\nhave formed the new shoots the coming season. The result of this\r\ntreatment is to call into action several buds at the upper part of the\r\nstock. These are to form the arms of the tree, and hence a very\r\nimportant part of the pruning and training of the plant is thus\r\nperformed at once by this simple operation of heading-back the young\r\nnursery tree. But further attention is needed, as these arms develop\r\nthemselves during the next season of growth; they should not be too\r\nnumerous, nor too much crowded together; they should not be too nearly\r\nmatched in strength, and one should be kept as a leader, stronger than\r\nthe rest. Never allow two shoots to remain contending for the mastery;\r\none of them should be subordinated by cutting, breaking, or twisting,\r\nas soon as it is observed; for how beautifully developed, a tree grown\r\nin this way, may appear when well balanced, there is always danger of\r\nits splitting down when heavily laden with fruit. This very common\r\nerror of our orchards used to be quaintly illustrated by a dear old\r\nfriend on the prairies of Illinois, who cited the advice of a Scotch\r\njockey to whom he had applied for counsel in the purchase of a piece\r\nof horse-flesh. \"Ne'er buy a horse whose twa fore-legs cum oot frae ae\r\nhole,\" said he, and Mr. W. Stewart applied the same principle to his\r\nyoung fruit trees, by never allowing them to have two equal leaders,\r\nbranching from one point. It is also important to have the lateral\r\nbranches regularly distributed on different sides.\r\n\r\nThe precise point or elevation point at which this heading-back should\r\nbe done, will depend very much upon the object of the cultivator, and\r\nwhether he desires to produce a high or a low head, a standard, half\r\nstandard, or a dwarf, or conical tree--such as are often called\r\npyramids. He will study the wants and fancies of his customers in this\r\nmatter, but we of the West, have learned the importance for us, at\r\nleast, of _trimming our trees down_, and not trimming them up, as is\r\noften done by those who anticipate plowing and planting crops under\r\nthe shade of their orchards. The proper point for forming the branches\r\nto make the head, will very much depend, however, upon the habit of\r\nthe variety; whether it be drooping, spreading, or upright. The former\r\nwill require the branches to be started at a higher point. The proper\r\nseason for performing this kind of pruning is in the early spring, or\r\nafter the severe frosts of winter have passed; and with some kinds of\r\norchard trees, it may be done at the time of transplanting them, when\r\nthey need a severe pruning.\r\n\r\nThe second object of pruning being done with a view to the production\r\nof fruitfulness in the tree, is to be practised chiefly in the summer.\r\nAt the same time, or during the growing season, much may be done to\r\nadvantage, both in thinning-out and shortening-in such parts of the\r\ntree, as may need these plans of treatment. Various methods are\r\npursued to produce fruitfulness, all of them depending upon the fact\r\nthat this condition arises from the natural habit of a tree to make\r\nits wood-growth freely for a series of years. After it has built up a\r\ncomplicated structure of limbs and branches, with some consequent\r\nobstruction to the flow of sap, depending upon the hardening of the\r\nwoody tissues, and the tortuous course of its circulation, it then\r\nappears to have reached its maturity, or its fruit-bearing condition.\r\nIt then ceases to make such free wood-growth, and prepares a set of\r\nbuds, which develop flowers and fruit.\r\n\r\nNow this period of growth and unfruitfulness may continue for a longer\r\nor shorter time in different varieties of fruits; and the shortening\r\nof this, is the great object of summer pruning, and of other methods\r\nof producing fruitfulness that may be classed under this second head\r\nof the objects of pruning.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate their importance and the mode in which the effect is\r\nproduced, we must ever bear in mind the two great acts of vegetable\r\nlife, that of wood-growth or growth by extension, and the wonderful\r\nmorphological change of this growth into flowers and fruit. These are,\r\nin some sense, antagonistic. The first is essential to the production\r\nof timber, to the building up of the tree, and should be encouraged to\r\ndo its work undisturbed, up to a certain point, that we may have a\r\nsubstantial frame-work by which our fruits can be supported. The\r\nlatter, however, is the ultimate desideratum with fruit-growers, and\r\nin our impatience to reap a quick reward, we often resort to measures\r\nthat tend to curtail the usefulness, size, and beauty, as well as the\r\npermanence of our trees. This is an illustration of the axiom, that\r\nwhatever threatens the vitality of a plant, tends to make it fruitful;\r\nit calls into activity the instinctive effort to perpetuate the\r\nspecies by the production of seed, that may be separated from the\r\nparent, and establish a separate and independent existence, to take\r\nthe place of that, the life of which is threatened.\r\n\r\nSummer pruning and pinching interferes with the growth by extension,\r\nand threatens the very life of the tree; the entire removal of all new\r\nshoots and their foliage, and the removal of the successive attempts\r\nby the tree at their reproduction, will cause its death in a little\r\nwhile. Their partial abstraction, as practiced in summer pruning and\r\npinching, being an attack of the same kind, results in the formation\r\nof fruit-buds. The operations of budding and grafting upon an\r\nuncongenial stock, interrupting the circulation by ringing, by\r\nligatures, by hacking, twisting, and bending downward, all tend to\r\ncheck the growth by extension, and are attended by similar results,\r\nsince they are antagonistic to the mere production of wood.\r\nShortening-in the branches of some species, which form their\r\nfruit-buds upon the shoots of the current year, has the effect to give\r\nthem a fuller development, if performed during the summer, but if\r\ndeferred until the following spring, it will have the directly\r\nopposite result, and will cause the production of woody shoots at the\r\nexpense of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe season for pruning has been made the subject of much discussion,\r\nand different periods have been very confidently advised by different\r\nauthorities, from which it may safely be inferred that all are\r\nsomewhat right, or may be supported by good reasons. This refers of\r\ncourse to pruning in its general sense, of trimming, and applies to\r\nthe removal of limbs of greater or less size. We always desire to\r\navoid the removal of large limbs, and should endeavor to provide\r\nagainst the necessity of such removal, by trimming our orchards\r\nsufficiently when they are young, and while the branches are small;\r\nbut when such removal becomes absolutely necessary, it should be\r\nperformed late in the autumn, when vegetation is at rest, because it\r\nis found that such large wounds, which cannot be soon healed over by\r\nthe new growth, will at this season dry in, and resist the action of\r\nthe elements better than if the section had been made when the wood\r\nwas full of sap in active circulation.\r\n\r\nEarly spring is a favorite period for pruning, chiefly because it is\r\ncomparatively a period of leisure; the weather is less inclement than\r\nin winter, and the absence of foliage affords us an opportunity to see\r\nour work and to anticipate its effects upon the tree. So soon as the\r\nbuds begin to swell and the foliage to expand, pruning should be\r\narrested, unless in small trees, because the sap is in active motion,\r\nand the material called _cambium_ is not yet developed, hence the\r\nwounds will bleed, and are not so readily healed over; besides, the\r\nbark at this season is very readily separated from the wood, and bad\r\nwounds are thus frequently produced by the pruner, which may seriously\r\ndamage the tree. Then follows a period when pruning had better be\r\nsuspended until the time that the trees have completed their growth by\r\nextension, and formed the terminal bud at the ends of their shoots.\r\nThe date cannot be given, but it is sufficiently indicated by this\r\nmark in nature's calendar; the formation and full development of the\r\nterminal bud, and by the copious deposits of woody matter throughout\r\nthe tree. The annual layer of fibres is then being produced, and the\r\ntissues are in the formative stage; the tree now possesses within its\r\nown organism the best of all plasters to cure and cover the wounds\r\nmade by the saw and knife, now the tree possesses the true _vis\r\nmedicatrix naturæ_ in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nA few intelligent nurserymen have learned this very important lesson,\r\nand have applied it in the preparation of their trees, for the\r\nexposure incident to their removal from the nursery to the orchard. A\r\nvery few practice it systematically; I knew one, (alas, for the\r\nlamented Beeler, of Indiana), who acted upon the suggestion made to\r\nhim by observations and experiments in vegetable physiology. He left\r\nthe side branches, though subordinated by shortening when necessary,\r\nin order to give stocky stems to his trees, and then removed them with\r\nthe knife during the summer before they were to be sold and planted,\r\ninstead of waiting until they were dug and sent to the packing house\r\nin the fall or spring. The result was, that while his stems were stout\r\nand stocky, they were also smooth, the wounds neatly healed over with\r\nnew bark, instead of being open from the fresh cuts and liable to\r\ncrack or bleed, as they would have done had this pruning been deferred\r\nuntil after digging, either in the fall or spring. This may be\r\nconsidered a small matter, but it is an illustration of the principle\r\ninvolved in selecting the period for pruning.\r\n\r\nFor the removal of small limbs from young trees, hardly any time can\r\ncome amiss--better to do it out of season than to neglect it, and it\r\nis a good rule to have a sharp pruning knife always at hand when\r\npassing through our young orchards. There is but one time when pruning\r\nis absolutely interdicted, and that is when the wood is frozen. When\r\nso circumstanced, it should never be cut nor disturbed in any\r\nmanner--not even to gratify your best friend, by helping him to a few\r\ngrafts from your proved tree of some coveted variety. Let him wait for\r\na thaw, or go away without the grafts, rather than commit such an\r\noutrage upon your tree: as to approach it with a knife when frozen.\r\n\r\nWhile considering the question of the proper season for pruning, there\r\nis one axiom of great importance which should be firmly impressed upon\r\nthe mind of the orchardist. Much will depend upon which of the two\r\nleading objects, above indicated, he may have in view--vigor of growth\r\nand symmetry of form, or simply fruitfulness, as the result of his\r\nlabors in pruning his trees. Pruning at one season will induce the\r\nformer result, at a different period of the year the same work will\r\nconduce to the latter; hence the postulate _Prune in winter for wood;\r\nin summer for fruit_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHINNING.\r\n\r\n  PROFUSION OF FRUIT-BUDS.

BY SEVERE WINTER\r\n    PRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery person who has looked at a bearing fruit tree in the winter\r\nseason, must have been struck with wonder at the great profusion of\r\nfruit-buds with which it was clothed; they are crowded along the\r\nslender spray of some varieties as thickly as a necklace of beads, or\r\nstill more abundantly, like clusters of pearls, they are crowded\r\ntogether upon the little fruit-spurs. We are inclined to cavil at this\r\nprofusion of nature, and to ask why this waste of vegetative effort.\r\nBut we may rest assured that it is only another evidence of the\r\nunerring wisdom of Him who doeth all things well.\r\n\r\nAll blossoming and fruiting is but a changed condition of those buds\r\nthat would otherwise have produced leaves and wood-growth. Every tree,\r\nsooner or later, reaches a point which we call its period of maturity,\r\nwhen some of its buds are thus modified. The same elemental parts are\r\nstill present; but those that were arranged for the production of an\r\nelongated shoot, with leaves set around it in some definite manner,\r\nand destined for the formation of woody growth, are now so constituted\r\nas to have a growth of very short extension, and furnished with\r\nmodified leaves, so changed, that we scarcely recognize them thus\r\ncrowded together upon this shortened and modified axis. We here take\r\nour first lesson in the very interesting study of morphology, or the\r\nscience of the changes of form to which the parts of a plant are\r\nsubjected, in the production of flowers and fruit, from what were\r\notherwise the source of shoots and leaves. This will be found one of\r\nthe most interesting branches of the study of botany, as it leads us\r\nto the investigation of one of the most beautiful displays of Divine\r\npower, and, like all such studies, gives us more and more elevated\r\nviews of the exalted wisdom and benevolence of an All-wise Creator,\r\nwho has produced nothing in vain, and who, while creating worlds and\r\nsystems of the greatest magnificence, has condescended to prepare the\r\nmost tiny flower, and its previous bud, in the most perfect manner.\r\n\r\nThe study of morphology which gives us such an insight into the\r\nmechanism of the plant, and which leads us into such mazes of wonder\r\nand admiration, cannot now detain us further than to be named and\r\nreferred to as the explanation of the formation of what we call fruit\r\nor blossom buds. The reader is referred to the full explanations of\r\nthis subject by the famous philosopher and poet, Goethe; or, if more\r\nconveniently accessible, to his English translators, or to the\r\nappropriate chapters in any of the modern text books of botany.\r\n\r\nWhen the plant is young, its chief object is to grow; it must acquire\r\nsize and development, to enable it to produce and bear up the enormous\r\ncrop it is destined one day to yield. Hence in the early years of a\r\ntree there is none, or very little of this transformation of the buds,\r\nwhich are all of the pointed character, and when excited into growth,\r\nthey all produce shoots and leaves only, which result in the formation\r\nof an increase of the woody fabric, that we call the tree. This period\r\nof adolescence is longer or shorter in different species and\r\nvarieties--in some it may extend through many years. Thus, the\r\nAmerican Aloe is called the Century Plant, from the common belief that\r\nit must survive a hundred summers before this stage of maturity and\r\nblossoming is reached; whereas this plant only needs a period of\r\nthirty years or less to produce its blossoms, when it is favorably\r\nsituated as to soil and climate.\r\n\r\nThere is, it is probable, a definite period at which each kind of\r\nplant will have these changes occur in the buds, when they will begin\r\nto flower and to produce fruit. This period may be accelerated or\r\nretarded, to some extent, by human means; for we have observed, that\r\nwhatever produces excessive vigor, is attended with the formation of\r\nleaf buds; whereas, all those conditions and circumstances that check\r\nthe vigorous growth by extension, provided they do not too greatly\r\nimpair the vitality of the plant, will conduce to the formation of\r\nflower-buds.\r\n\r\nSome of these conditions consist in starving the tree, or by planting\r\nit in a sterile soil, that has deficient moisture; by severely\r\ncrowding the roots, or by cutting them, as in root pruning; in\r\ngrafting a portion of the young plant upon an old or an uncongenial\r\nstock, or one that is naturally dwarfish; in ringing the bark; in\r\nfrequent transplanting, or in continued summer pinching; in short,\r\nalmost any circumstances which appear to threaten the life of the\r\ntree, seem to excite within it an effort for the preservation and\r\nperpetuation of the species, by changing the bud plants, attached to\r\nthe parent, into seed plants, that may and will be separated from it\r\nto reach the soil eventually, and there to establish an independent\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAs the tree advances in growth, and approaches toward its natural\r\nperiod of maturity, it is supposed that there is an accumulation of\r\nnutritive matter within it, and at the same time the roots will have\r\nexhausted the soil, to some extent, of the elements that contributed\r\nto the production of wood-growth, and the result is the formation of\r\nflower-buds. Now it becomes a nice matter to preserve the proper\r\nbalance between these two systems of growth, the wood producing and\r\nthe fruit forming. Two opposite systems of production have become\r\nestablished in the tree, the one infertile, the other producing the\r\ndesired fruits; the one preserving the health and vigor of the tree,\r\nthe other tending to preserve the species at the same time that it\r\nsatisfies our demands for fruit, but also meanwhile tending to the\r\ndestruction of the tree, for all old trees are apt to overbear. Young\r\ntrees, on the contrary, in which the vigor of wood-growth remains in\r\nfull activity, very often produce fruit-buds and blossoms, but do not\r\nperfect their fruit, which either fails to set, from some imperfection\r\nof the organs of reproduction, or falls prematurely, in consequence of\r\nthe wood system absorbing the nutriment, or failing to prepare the\r\nproper juices for their support. Trees, in these different conditions,\r\nrequire an entirely opposite treatment. The younger need summer\r\npruning and pinching, to check their too great vigor, and to develop\r\nthe laterals or spurs with their blossom buds; the older need winter\r\npruning, for the double purpose of reducing the amount of fruit, and\r\nalso to excite renewed vigor in the production of wood growth that\r\nshall take the place of that which has been removed. This subject will\r\nbe more appropriately discussed in another chapter, to which the\r\nreader is referred; while we proceed to the legitimate topic of\r\nthinning fruit.\r\n\r\nThinning fruit is not practiced as it should be, particularly on the\r\napple; old trees are often too fruitful, so much so as not only to\r\ndeteriorate the fruit, but to injure the tree itself. This is so much\r\nthe case with certain varieties, as to constitute a serious objection\r\nto planting them; other sorts so exhaust themselves by over-production\r\nin one season, as to be barren, or nearly so, the next year, during\r\nwhich period of rest they are able to recuperate their energies and to\r\nprovide a new set of flower-buds. These are called biennial bearers,\r\nand such are quite numerous in our orchards. Those kinds that are\r\nprone to overbear every year, are often objectionable on account of\r\nthe diminished size and inferior character of their fruits, which\r\nresult from this cause, particularly when the trees have become old.\r\nThe great desideratum, especially with those who object to the trouble\r\nof thinning the fruit, is to find a variety that will produce an even\r\nor well distributed, continuous, and moderate yield--an annual bearer,\r\nthat does not exhaust itself by the production of one enormous crop so\r\nas to require it to rest and recuperate. Such varieties are to be\r\nfound in our collections, and should be highly prized.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our topic, the bold method of reducing the crop by\r\nwinter pruning, has already been alluded to, and is highly recommended\r\nfor such old trees as have ceased producing thrifty shoots of\r\nwood-growth at their tips, and have taken on an excessive tendency to\r\nfruitage. There are other methods of producing this desired effect,\r\ndiminishing the amount of fruit when excessive, and thereby greatly\r\nenlarging the size, and improving the flavor of that which is left\r\nbehind: some of these will now be mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBUDDING.--One of these consists in the removal of alternate buds,\r\nor even a greater proportion than one half; this may be performed\r\neither in the end of winter or in early spring, or even after the buds\r\nhave pushed, still later in the season. This work may be done with the\r\nfingers, a knife, or by using the shears, when the buds are terminal,\r\nas in old bearing apples and pears, or on some cherries. This plan has\r\nbeen practiced with very good success upon the Duchesse pear, by T.W.\r\nField, who accidentally had his attention directed to the feasibility\r\nof making this variety very productive. He had observed that certain\r\ntrees, which were rubbed so by the cart-wheels as to be stripped of a\r\nportion of their buds in the winter season, instead of being injured\r\nthereby, were more productive than those which retained all of their\r\nabundant spurs and blossoms, and which, nevertheless, often bore\r\nsparsely. Improving upon this hint, he has since planted some such\r\nvarieties in close rows or hedges, which he trims annually with the\r\nshears to keep them within bounds, and at the same time to diminish\r\nthe amount of blossoms. Disbudding is systematically pursued in the\r\nEuropean fruit-gardens, and we have elaborate directions for the\r\nseason and mode of performing the operation, which is extensively\r\npracticed, particularly on the trees that are grown as espaliers, and\r\nthose kept in orchard houses. If neglected, the trees become exhausted\r\nby over-production; and the failure of production by the fruit-spurs\r\nwhich results, causes vacant spaces upon the tree, which are\r\nafterward, with difficulty, restored to a profitable condition.\r\n\r\nAnother method, and the one usually pursued by those who practice\r\nthinning, is, to go over their trees after blossoming, while the fruit\r\nis still small, and systematically remove such a proportion as they\r\nmay deem sufficient to relieve them of the surplus; and while so\r\ndoing, they select for removal all the inferior specimens. This is\r\nfound to pay very well in the increased size, appearance, and flavor\r\nof those that remain, and is practiced by all good horticulturists.\r\n\r\nIt is found in some varieties that the thinning may be done when the\r\nfruit has attained to one-half its usual size, so that it may be\r\nmarketed, and yet those which are left, will swell out to their full\r\nproportions after this removal, and will realize, when harvested, more\r\nmoney, and will even be of greater weight than if the whole crop had\r\nbeen left upon the tree until its natural period of maturity. The\r\nreason is obvious, and depends upon the greater size and fuller\r\ndevelopment of the fruit, which remains after thinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER PRUNING has already been alluded to as one of the methods of\r\nproducing fruitfulness. When it is here introduced as a means of\r\nthinning the fruit, the recommendation may appear somewhat\r\nparadoxical--yet it is not so. Neither is this cutting a parallel\r\noperation to that in which we seek to check the excessive vigor of\r\nyoung shoots by pinching and heading-in, with a view to directing the\r\nsap to the lateral buds so as to cause their development for the\r\nformation of fruit-spurs, which will insure a greater production of\r\nfruit: whereas this summer pruning removes a portion of the crop to be\r\nsupported by the tree. This plan is most successfully practiced by\r\njudicious orchardists, among whom may be named Dr. Hull, of Alton,\r\nIll., who has thus treated his peaches, nectarines, and plums. This\r\nprocess consists in cutting off the ends of the shoots that are laden\r\nwith fruit, while these are yet quite small; the superabundance is\r\nthus removed in a great degree by the knife, and the excess of foliage\r\nis also diminished so as to expose the fruit freely to the sun and\r\nair, which insures an increased size and heightened color,\r\nparticularly to the peaches and nectarines. The remaining fruit is\r\nalso suitably thinned so that no specimens shall crowd one another.\r\nThe exact distances between them must be determined by the judgment of\r\nthe operator; some have decided that peaches should not be nearer\r\nthan nine inches; plums and nectarines may be separated by a smaller\r\ndistance; but it is not easy to lay down a precise rule.\r\n\r\nThinning is not often practiced upon the strawberry crop, which\r\nappears able upon suitable soils to produce a great abundance of fine\r\nfruit, but it may be done by the curious, and enormous show specimens,\r\nsuch as are often exhibited at fairs, are produced by special care and\r\nhigh manuring, aided greatly by judicious thinning; not only by\r\ncutting back a portion of the crowns, so as to throw the whole force\r\nof the plant into one or two trusses, but still further, by removing\r\nwith the scissors a portion of the blossoms or fruit, so that the few\r\nwhich are left may become enormously distended with the nutriment that\r\nhad been stored up in the plant for a much greater number. Some may\r\nconsider this one of the tricks of the trade, and so it is when merely\r\ndone for the sake of deceiving the public, who are asked to purchase\r\nthe variety by the sample of fruit, without detailing the arts by\r\nwhich the results were accomplished: but there can be no objection\r\nraised against such practices when pursued by the amateur for the sake\r\nof producing unusually large fruits of any variety.\r\n\r\nThe English pursue a similar method with their show gooseberries; by\r\nmeans of thinning and high feeding, with great attention to watering,\r\nthese fruits are made to assume gigantic proportions that are little\r\ndreamed of by cultivators of the smaller varieties, which are chiefly\r\ngrown in this country.\r\n\r\nThe grape is very prone to over-production, and the crop, as well as\r\nthe vine itself, is often much injured by a want of attention to this\r\nparticular. So avaricious is man, that few persons will exert the\r\nneeded firmness and perseverance to remove the excess which the\r\nbeautiful vine annually affords. The result of this neglect is\r\napparent at the vintage, especially when from any fault of the season,\r\nor from the invasion of insects or of mildew, the foliage may have\r\nbeen damaged, as it frequently is, to a considerable extent. Then we\r\nfind large quantities of the grapes so deficient in color and flavor\r\nas to be worthless; in some varieties whole bunches will hang flaccid,\r\nwithered, and insipid--while perhaps a few, more favorably situated,\r\nwill have their proper flavor. The grape vine is well called\r\nbeautiful, and it is capable of sustaining most wonderful amounts of\r\nfruit; but on young vines, especially, it is very bad policy to allow\r\nof this over-production.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to fruitage may be met in different ways, a few of which\r\nwill now be pointed out, and all planters are urged to observe and to\r\npractice some of these plans for reducing the exuberance of this kind\r\nof fruit. In the first place we practice winter pruning, regardless of\r\nits established and well-known effect of producing an increase of\r\nwood-growth, for this is what we desire to obtain in the vine, on\r\naccount of its habit of yielding its fruit on wood of the previous\r\nyear's growth; by this means we are able to pursue the renewal system,\r\nwhich is so generally preferred, and thus we may keep our vines\r\nperpetually clothed with new wood, or canes as they are technically\r\ncalled. By this winter pruning we can reduce the amount of wood that\r\nis of a bearing character, to any point which may be deemed desirable,\r\naccording to the strength and age of the vine, and thus the crop is\r\nthinned by a wholesale process of lopping off the superabundance of\r\nbuds, that would have produced an excess of fruit. Another method of\r\nthinning is, to rub out a portion of the shoots, this may be every\r\nalternate branch in close jointed varieties of the vine: this is to be\r\ndone soon after the buds have burst, and while the branches are yet\r\nquite small, so that the vital forces may be directed to those that\r\nremain. Wherever double shoots appear, the weaker should always be\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nStill another method of reducing the superabundance, remains to be\r\nnoticed; this consists in thinning the grapes themselves, the separate\r\nberries, which, in some varieties, are often so crowded upon the\r\nbunch, as to prove a serious injury to one another. In hardy out-door\r\nculture this is seldom practiced, being less necessary than in the\r\nlarge varieties of foreign grapes that are grown under glass. These\r\nare systematically thinned with the scissors, so that none shall crowd\r\ntogether; and this process, repeated from time to time, is found to\r\nproduce much finer and larger berries and heavier bunches than when\r\nall are left.\r\n\r\nA very rude method has sometimes been pursued in thinning the\r\nsuperabundance of fruit upon apple trees. It appears so very Gothic\r\nthat its description may only excite a smile, when it is stated that\r\nit consists in threshing the tree with a long slender pole, by which a\r\nportion of the fruit is cast to the ground. Rude and primitive as this\r\nmethod may appear, it is surely better than no thinning at all, and is\r\nattended with this good result, for which it deserves some\r\ncommendation; the threshing removes portions of the excessive twiggy\r\nspray that always abounds upon such trees as those under\r\nconsideration, and thus, in a degree, it prevents the recurrence of so\r\nheavy a crop the following year. Whenever an old orchard has reached\r\nthis condition of over-fruitfulness, however, the best method of\r\nthinning is to give a severe winter pruning; removing portions of the\r\nspray and encouraging the free growth of young wood in various parts\r\nof the top, to replace the older portions that were removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nRIPENING AND PRESERVING FRUITS.\r\n\r\n  CHANGES DURING THE PROCESS OF RIPENING.

While he is\r\ncontemplating the rich returns for his capital and labor expended upon\r\nthe orchard, however, he will find many circumstances in the functions\r\nof his plants that will amply repay him for their careful study. Nor\r\nshould he consider these only as matters of philosophical interest,\r\nfor they will often lead him into courses of treatment that will\r\nenable him to secure richer returns than he would otherwise attain. A\r\nfew of these will be presented in the commencement of this chapter,\r\nnor need any apology be offered for quoting one of the highest\r\nauthorities in the language upon this branch of botanical study.\r\nBalfour gives the following account of the changes which occur in the\r\nvegetable economy during the formation and ripening of fruits, under\r\nwhich term he includes, in botanical language, all seeds, whether the\r\ndry pericarps, or the pulpy drupes, and other appendages, which are\r\nrecognized as fruits proper in pomological language.\r\n\r\n\"While the fruit enlarges, the sap is drawn towards it, and a great\r\nexhaustion of the juices of the plant takes place. In annuals, this\r\nexhaustion is such as to destroy the plants; but if they are prevented\r\nfrom bearing fruit, they may be made to live for two or more years.\r\nPerennials, by acquiring increased vigor, are able better to bear the\r\ndemand made upon them during fruiting. If large and highly flavored\r\nfruit is desired, it is of importance to allow an accumulation of sap\r\nto take place before the plant flowers. When a very young plant is\r\npermitted to blossom, it seldom brings fruit to perfection. When a\r\nplant produces fruit in very large quantities, gardeners are in the\r\nhabit of thinning it early, in order that there may be an increased\r\nsupply of sap for that which remains. In this way, peaches,\r\nnectarines, apricots, etc., are rendered larger and better flavored.\r\nWhen the fruiting is checked for one season, there is an accumulation\r\nof nutritive matter which has a beneficial effect upon the subsequent\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n\"The pericarp is at first of a green color, and performs the same\r\nfunctions as the other green parts of plants, decomposing carbonic\r\nacid under the agency of light and liberating oxygen. Saussure asserts\r\nthat all fruits, in a green state, are adequate to perform this\r\nprocess of deoxidation. As the pericarp advances to maturity, it\r\neither becomes dry or succulent. In the former case it changes into a\r\nbrown or white color, and has a quantity of ligneous matter deposited\r\nin its substance, so as to acquire great hardness, where it is\r\nincapable of performing any process of vegetable life; in the latter\r\nit becomes fleshy in its texture, and assumes various bright tints. In\r\nfleshy fruits, however, there is frequently a deposition of ligneous\r\ncells in the endocarp, forming the stone of the fruit; and even in the\r\npulpy matter of the sarcocarp, there are found isolated cells of a\r\nsimilar nature, as in some varieties of pear, where they cause a\r\npeculiar grittiness. The contents of the cells near the outside of\r\nsucculent fruits are thickened by exhalation, and a process of\r\nendosmose goes on, by which the thinner contents of the inner cells\r\npass outward, and thus cause swelling of the fruit. As the fruit\r\nadvances to maturity, however, this exhalation diminishes, the water\r\nbecoming free and entering into new combinations. In all pulpy fruits,\r\nwhich are not green, there are changes going on by which carbon is\r\nseparated in combination with oxygen.\r\n\r\n* * * \"Succulent fruits contain a large quantity of water along with\r\ncellulose or lignine, sugar, gummy matter or dextrine, albumen,\r\ncoloring matter, various organic acids, as citric, malic and tartaric,\r\ncombined with lime and alkaline substances, beside a pulpy gelatinous\r\nmatter, which is converted by acids into pectine, whence pectic acid\r\nis formed by the action of albumen. Pectine is soluble in water, and\r\nexists in the pulp of fruits, as apples, gooseberries, currants,\r\nstrawberries, etc. Pectic acid is said to consist of C.14, H.3, O.12 +\r\nH.O. It absorbs water, and is changed into a jelly-like matter, hence\r\nits use in making preserves. Each kind of fruit is flavored with a\r\npeculiar aromatic substance. Starch is rarely present in the pericarp\r\nof the fruit, although it occurs commonly in the seed. * * *\r\n\r\n\"During the ripening much of the water disappears, while the cellulose\r\nor lignine and the dextrine are converted into sugar. Berard is of\r\nopinion that the changes in fruits are caused by the action of the\r\noxygen of the air. Freney found that fruits, covered with varnish, did\r\nnot ripen. As the process of ripening becomes perfected, the acids\r\ncombine with alkalies, and thus the acidity of the fruit diminishes,\r\nwhile its sweetness increases. The formation of sugar is by some\r\nattributed to the action of organic acids on the vegetable\r\nconstituents, gum, dextrine, and starch; others think that the\r\ncellulose and lignine are similarly changed, by the action of acids.\r\nThe formation of sugar is said to be prevented by watering the tree\r\nwith alkaline solutions. * * * In seasons, when there is little sun,\r\nbut a great abundance of moisture, succulent fruits become watery and\r\nlose their flavor. The same thing frequently takes place in young\r\ntrees with abundance of sap, and in cases where a large supply of\r\nwater has been given artificially.\" Travelers, who have eaten the\r\nmagnificent specimens of fruits produced by irrigation, in California,\r\ntell us that they are deficient in flavor, and the same thing is\r\nsometimes observed as a result of an unusually wet season.\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy in all cases to determine the exact time when the\r\nfruit is ripe. In dry fruits, the period immediately before\r\ndehiscence,[21] is considered as that of maturation; but in pulpy\r\nfruits, there is much uncertainty. It is usual to say that edible\r\nfruits are ripe when their ingredients are in such a state of\r\ncombination as to give the most agreeable flavor. After such are ripe,\r\nin the ordinary sense, so as to be capable of being used for food,\r\nthey undergo further changes by the oxidation of their tissues, even\r\nafter being separated from the plant. In some cases these changes\r\nimprove the quality of the fruit, as in the case of the medlar, the\r\nausterity of which is thus still further diminished. In the pear, this\r\nprocess renders it soft, but still fit for food, while in the apple it\r\ncauses a decay which acts injuriously on its qualities. By this\r\nprocess of oxidation, the whole fruit is ultimately reduced to a\r\nputrescent mass, which probably acts beneficially in promoting the\r\ngermination of the seeds when the fruit drops on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"The periods of time required for ripening the fruit, varies in\r\ndifferent plants. Most fruits ripen within a year from the expansion\r\nof the flower, some come to maturity within a few days, others require\r\nmonths. Certain plants, as some Coniferæ, require more than a year,\r\nand in the Metrosideros the fruit remains attached to the branch for\r\nseveral years. The following is a general statement of the usual time\r\nrequired for the maturation of fruits:--\r\n\r\n  Grasses and Grains                                    13 to 15 days.\r\n  Raspberry, Strawberry, Cherry                              2 months.\r\n  Bird-cherry, Lime-tree                                     3 months.\r\n  Roses, White Thorn, Horsechestnut                          4 months.\r\n  Vine, Pear, Apple, Walnut, Beech, Plum, Nut, Almond   5 to 6 months.\r\n  Olive, Savin                                               7 months.\r\n  Colchicum, Mistletoe                                  8 to 9 months.\r\n  Coniferæ                                            10 to 12 months.\r\n  Some Coniferæ, certain Oaks, and Metrosideros       above 12 months.\r\n\r\n\"The ripening of fruits may be accelerated by the application of heat,\r\nthe placing of dark-colored bricks below it, and by removing a ring of\r\nbark, so as to lead to an accumulation of sap. It has been observed\r\nthat plants, subjected to a high temperature, not unfrequently prove\r\nabortive; this seems to result from the over stimulation, causing the\r\nproduction of uni-sexual flowers alone. Trees are sometimes made to\r\nproduce fruit by checking their roots when too luxuriant, and by\r\npreventing the excessive development of branches.\"[22] Here we have\r\nthe explanation of the processes of root pruning and of summer\r\npinching, and shortening-in, which have been more extensively\r\nintroduced upon another page; as well as the plan for inducing\r\nfruitfulness in such trees as are tardy from excessive wood-growth, by\r\nhacking the bark to interrupt the flow of sap from the buds to the\r\nroots; by this, some of the former are changed to flower-buds.\r\n\r\nWe may learn to judge of the condition of ripeness of our larger\r\nsucculent fruits, such as apples and pears, by a little experience.\r\nWhen ready to be picked, they will have attained their maximum size,\r\ntheir color will have changed somewhat from its greenness, and they\r\nwill assume a sort of translucency that indicates the approach of\r\nmaturity; but the best practical test for the fruit-gatherer, is the\r\nready separation of the stem from its attachment. In those fruits,\r\nwhich are suspended by a stem of considerable length, and in which\r\nthis organ belongs to the fruit itself, and is intimately connected\r\nwith its tissues, we shall find that it will part easily from the\r\nbranch at that period of ripeness when it is best to separate it. Such\r\nfruits are often much improved by a continuation of the process of\r\nripening after they are gathered, but this more properly belongs to\r\nanother division of the subject. There is another class of fruits\r\nwhich are found to attain their greatest excellence and most perfect\r\nripening upon the tree itself, and these can never be enjoyed\r\nelsewhere in so great perfection as in close proximity to the place of\r\ntheir production; because, so soon as they are separated from their\r\nconnection with the plant, a process of decomposition commences, they\r\nbegin to decay, and many of them soon become really unwholesome. Most\r\nof those that are called stone-fruits are of this character, such as\r\npeaches, nectarines, apricots, plums, and cherries--all of which have\r\na very transitory period of excellence. The same is still more\r\nremarkably the case with most of the berries, hence all of these\r\nclasses of fruits are better adapted to a near than to a distant\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nWith apples and pears, however, the case is quite different. Some of\r\nthese, it is true, especially some of the summer varieties, will\r\nattain a perfect state of ripeness while yet attached to the tree, and\r\nsome of them will even remain hanging to the twig, until they reach\r\nthat condition of over-ripeness in which they lose a portion of their\r\nfine juices and become mealy, or incipient decay may set in, so as to\r\nmake them rotten at the core. Hence, in nearly all varieties, it is\r\nfound best to pluck the fruit a little prematurely, and we are guided\r\nby the natural indication of the falling of a portion of the crop. By\r\nthis means we can, in a degree, control the final ripening of our\r\nfruits; and we have the great advantage of being able to ship them in\r\na firm condition to distant markets, so as to arrive at the end of a\r\nlong journey in prime order; whereas, if thoroughly ripe, they could\r\nonly be transported a few miles, and then needing the greatest care in\r\ntheir handling. Our summer varieties always require to be near their\r\nultimate ripeness when gathered; for, if plucked too soon, they will\r\nwither, and be worthless. Among these, there are some varieties,\r\nparticularly of the apple, which continue ripening for a long period.\r\nIn the limited family orchard this quality is a great desideratum in\r\nthe summer fruits, but it is quite otherwise in the orchards, which\r\nare planted for profit in the market, because of the increased expense\r\nof gathering only a few at a time repeatedly, instead of clearing the\r\ntree at once. It is also found to be an advantage in shipping, to have\r\na considerable quantity of a kind to send off at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING.--We now come to the important matter of harvesting our\r\ncrops of fruits that have been the cause of so much care and anxiety,\r\nas well as of pleasure. This will require new considerations as to its\r\ndisposition and preservation to the best advantage, and will call for\r\na discussion of the best modes of packing, storing, ripening, and\r\ntransportation to market.\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said with regard to the process of ripening\r\nof fruits in the natural way upon the tree, it will be understood that\r\nwe must gather some kinds before they have reached their perfect\r\ncondition of maturity. There is a point at which they have obtained,\r\nfrom their connection with the parent tree, all the elements that are\r\nnecessary to the development of their highest qualities. They may now\r\nbe separated, not only with safety, but with decided advantage in many\r\ninstances, as they are improved by the further process of maturation\r\nunder different circumstances from those supplied by nature, and when\r\nproperly treated, they will acquire a much finer condition as to\r\ndelicacy and flavor than is ever reached by ripening upon the tree\r\nexposed to the light and air. This, it will be remembered, is not the\r\ncase with all fruits; for, as has already been stated, there are those\r\nwhich must remain upon the tree until they acquire their most perfect\r\nripeness, and which begin to depreciate in quality so soon as they are\r\nseparated from their connection with the fruit-bearing twig. These\r\nneed to be at once disposed of, and the consideration of the best\r\nmeans of transportation, is a question of more importance than any\r\nplans for their temporary preservation. They must be sold or used at\r\nonce, and should be handled with the greatest care, packed in suitable\r\nboxes or baskets in the most judicious manner for a good display of\r\ntheir beauties, for their preservation from bruising and decay, and\r\nfor sending them forward to their destination with the least possible\r\ndelay: the details of these several parts of the business will be left\r\nfor the exercise of the ingenuity of the parties most deeply\r\ninterested. In the class of fruits which are so constituted as to bear\r\nand indeed to require picking, before they have reached the period of\r\nperfect ripeness we shall find several particulars that need\r\nconsideration. First, it will be found that the proper time for\r\ngathering them varies considerably. Thus, with early apples and pears,\r\na few days only embrace the best period, during which they may be\r\ngathered without becoming wilted if plucked too soon, or decaying if\r\nleft too late. Even with winter fruits, we find that, to have them in\r\nperfection, some varieties require to be gathered much earlier than\r\nthe time usually assigned for harvesting the general crop. It is\r\nsomewhat singular also, that this course very considerably extends\r\ntheir time of keeping, and that some of those varieties which would\r\nbecome dry, mealy, and insipid, early in the winter, if gathered too\r\nlate, will remain sound, firm, plump, and juicy, and retain all their\r\nfine flavor through the winter, if they have been taken from the tree\r\nat an earlier period of the season. They must be left upon the tree\r\nuntil properly developed, however, and then be carefully kept in a\r\ncool apartment.\r\n\r\nThe usual season for gathering winter fruits is October, before the\r\naccess of severe frosts, and at a time when the wood-growth for the\r\nseason has been completed, and the foliage is nearly ready to separate\r\nfrom its attachment to the tree. The fruits will then generally part\r\nreadily from the twigs, without either breaking them or rupturing the\r\nfruit-stem, which should always be preserved, and from the apple\r\nespecially, it should never be pulled out, as is apt to happen in\r\ncertain varieties, when proper care is not exercised in picking them.\r\nSome of the apples that require to be gathered early, are, the Rambo,\r\nPryor's Red, Hubbardston, Westfield, Rhode Island Greening, several\r\nRussets, and all those which evince a tendency to fall prematurely.\r\nThere are others which may be left to a later period with impunity,\r\nsome of these will even bear a little freezing without serious damage,\r\nbut we should always endeavor to anticipate the exposure of our fruits\r\nto any great depression of temperature while they remain attached to\r\nthe trees. An early and severe frost has often proved disastrous to a\r\nfine crop of apples, thus left too long upon the trees.\r\n\r\nFor all fruits it is essential that the weather should be fine at the\r\ntime they are gathered. They should be perfectly dry when plucked, and\r\nthey must be handled with the greatest care to avoid bruising in the\r\nslightest degree. Each specimen must be taken separately in the hand\r\nand turned to one side, when, if it do not part readily from the twig,\r\nthe thumb and finger must be applied to the stem, to aid the\r\nseparation at the proper point; each is then to be placed in a\r\ngathering basket, which should be shallow, and for delicate sorts\r\nshould be lined loosely with fresh leaves or with soft moss, or a\r\nlittle wilted grass. From the baskets, the fruit should be transferred\r\nto its permanent winter quarters, by a careful and judicious hand, who\r\nshould select them and reject all that are bruised, specked, or\r\notherwise defective, and place them on the shelves, or pack them in\r\nthe boxes or barrels into which they are placed for preservation, or\r\ntransportation to market. In packing, it is best to use no material\r\nbut the fruit itself, which should be so closely placed that they\r\nshall not jostle and bruise one another when moved. Some persons use a\r\nbag, slung around the neck, when gathering the fruits from the tree;\r\ninto this they are placed as fast as they are plucked, and\r\nsuccessively transferred to the barrels, or poured in piles upon the\r\nground. With very firm varieties, this may be done without serious\r\ndamage, but the bruising that necessarily ensues will be very\r\nprejudicial to all the more delicate fruits, and will materially\r\ndepreciate the value of such as are also of a pale color. A want of\r\ncare in this matter of handling fruit is, no doubt, the chief reason\r\nfor the popular preference of red apples in our markets, since those,\r\nthat are well covered with a deep color, do not show the bruises that\r\nare so unseemly upon the fair cheek of the lighter colored varieties.\r\n\r\nThe modes of keeping winter fruits are exceedingly various, and some\r\nof them are quite primitive. The desiderata are coolness and dryness,\r\nwhich should not be carried to the extent of freezing, nor of\r\ndesiccation. The simplest method is to place the fruit in a pile upon\r\na dry piece of ground, to cover it thickly with clean dry straw, and,\r\nas the winter approaches, to apply a heavy layer of earth, sufficient\r\nto keep out the frost. Sometimes this is kept from the straw by a\r\nsimple roof of boards, which support the earth from pressing upon the\r\nfruit, and leave it in a sort of cave, which can be entered\r\noccasionally during the winter. This plan is only recommended for\r\nthose who have no cellars or other suitable apartments, for many\r\nfruits acquire an earthy flavor from this near contact with the soil.\r\nAnother primitive plan, and one which is well adapted to the\r\npreservation of cider apples, and might be used for the keeping of\r\nthose needed for stock feeding, is to build a rail-pen, four square,\r\nlike a field corn-crib, into which the fruit is put upon straw, and a\r\nlining of the same material is placed at the sides and upon the top,\r\nwhich may also be sheltered with boards to shed off the rain. In our\r\nmild winters, many varieties of fruits can be sufficiently well\r\npreserved in this manner for the purposes mentioned. In a proper\r\nestablishment for cider-making, large bins and rooms are provided\r\nwithin the building, which afford sufficient protection from the\r\nfrost, so that cider-making may be carried on during the winter; and\r\nin well arranged farm-steads, the feeding barns should be provided\r\nwith suitable compartments for the safe storage of fruits or roots,\r\nthat are to be fed to the stock during the inclement season, when they\r\nare so much needed.\r\n\r\nAll farm-houses should be provided with good deep and dry cellars,\r\nwhich will prove the best place for the storage of fruits. These may\r\nbe placed in bins, or, still better, upon shelves, as it is not\r\ndesirable to have too great a bulk together. When but one, or at most,\r\nbut two layers of fruit are deposited upon each shelf, and when each\r\nof these is placed at a sufficient distance from those above or below\r\nit, the whole may be easily inspected from time to time, and defective\r\nspecimens can be removed without disturbing the rest. These shelves\r\nshould be made of narrow strips, separated from one another by a space\r\nthat will admit of thorough ventilation. The whole apartment devoted\r\nto fruit, should be kept cool and dark, and free from moisture or\r\ndampness.\r\n\r\nMany large orchardists prefer to select their fruit from the picking\r\nbaskets, and pack at once in new barrels, which are made for this\r\nspecial purpose, and are not so tight as those used for flour. In\r\npacking these, it is desirable to place the fruit carefully in layers,\r\nfilling the space completely as the work proceeds, putting each\r\nspecimen down by hand, and when the vessel is filled to about an inch\r\nabove the chine, the heads are put on, a follower placed upon them,\r\nand the whole brought under the pressure of a lever, which forces the\r\nmass together so that there shall be no possibility of motion among\r\nthe fruit. It is better that the outer layers should be somewhat\r\nindented by the barrel heads, than that the whole should be spoiled by\r\nthe bruising that would follow from loose packing. These barrels are\r\noften left under the trees for some time, or they may be placed under\r\nan open shed for protection, prior to transportation. It is a common\r\npractice, before barreling, to deposit the fruit in piles as it is\r\ngathered, giving it only a covering of straw to allow it to throw off\r\na part of its moisture, a process generally termed sweating. Now it\r\ncannot be gainsaid that there may be an escape of the fluids by\r\ntranspiration through the pores of the skin, and we know that there is\r\na loss of weight and even of plumpness, in many varieties, by exposure\r\nin a dry atmosphere; but the excessive moisture observed upon the\r\nsurface of fruits that have been exposed to a low temperature, when\r\nthey are brought into a warmer apartment, is unquestionably the simple\r\nprecipitation of atmospheric moisture, and entirely independent of the\r\njuices of the fruit itself. The advantages of this method of treatment\r\nare, that more time is given for the careful selection of the fruits\r\nbefore placing them in the barrels, and a better opportunity for\r\nselection, and the rejection from the packages of all those which are\r\nin any way defective. The disadvantages are the increased labor and\r\nthe greater amount of handling to which the fruits are subjected. The\r\nsurface of our seed-fruits, (_pepins_), is endued with a peculiar\r\ncoating of a waxy nature, which is of great value for their\r\npreservation, and should not be removed, hence the less fruit is\r\nhandled, the better it will keep, and it should never be rubbed nor\r\nwiped; if too wet, or \"sweating,\" it should be exposed to a dry\r\natmosphere, until the surplus moisture shall have quietly evaporated\r\nbefore it is transferred or handled.\r\n\r\nIt is often observed of particular varieties that they are more prone\r\nto wilt than other kinds: this is particularly the case with Russet\r\napples, and is believed to result from a deficiency of this protecting\r\nouter covering or waxy exudation, which appears most plentiful in\r\nthose that retain their plumpness.\r\n\r\nIn packing for market, besides the directions already given as to\r\nprevent motion, it is very desirable to have the packages, of whatever\r\nform, whether boxes or barrels, of a neat appearance and uniform full\r\nsize. The fruits should be well selected, and of a like average\r\nquality throughout, and not fixed up for market with the best only at\r\nthe ends or sides that are to be first opened, while the inferior\r\nfruit is concealed within. Honesty is the best policy everywhere, and\r\ndealers soon learn to discriminate in favor of the brands of honest\r\npackers. It is believed that any orchardists, who will take pains in\r\nthe selection of their fruits, and in the excellence and honest\r\nmeasure of their packages, will soon establish a reputation that will\r\nbe of great value to them in their future offerings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT-ROOMS.--For those who wish to reap the highest rewards and the\r\ngreatest profits from a near and convenient market, as well as those\r\nwho desire to preserve their fruits, prolong their enjoyment of them,\r\nand to bring them to the highest perfection, the fruit-room or\r\nfruit-house becomes indispensable. These should be so constructed as\r\nto meet the required conditions of an equable and cool temperature,\r\nwith darkness, and a sufficient amount of dryness to insure freedom\r\nfrom mold and damp. To avoid the precipitation of atmospheric\r\nmoisture, the apartment should be tight, and seldom opened,\r\nparticularly in damp weather. To absorb the exhalations from the fruit\r\nitself, and that emitted from the burning candle or the breathing of\r\nthe visitor, the introduction of certain chemical absorbents has been\r\nsuggested; among these, freshly burned lime has been recommended and\r\nused, but Mr. Du Breuil advises the introduction of dry chloride of\r\ncalcium, which has so great an affinity for moisture as to absorb it\r\ncompletely from the atmosphere. This is the material used by B.M.\r\nNyce, of Cleveland, Ohio, in his patent fruit preserving\r\nestablishments; and this mode of preserving a dry atmosphere is a\r\nleading, and indeed, the chief feature and element of his success.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of fruit-houses, the fluctuations of the outer\r\natmospheric temperature must be guarded against by making double\r\nwalls, and by filling the spaces with non-conducting materials. The\r\nfloors and the ceiling should be similarly arranged--unless where the\r\ncooling is effected by a layer of ice above the fruit-room, when the\r\nceiling should be metallic, so as to enable the caloric to be rapidly\r\nabstracted from the space below. The house, patented by Prof. Nyce, is\r\nessentially a large refrigerator, with the ice at the top, and\r\nprovided with absorbents for removing from the air the moisture it has\r\nreceived from the fruit. Its construction will be understood from the\r\naccompanying diagrams and description. The lettering of similar parts\r\nis the same in all three diagrams; the description is that of the\r\ninventor.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--NYCE'S FRUIT PRESERVING HOUSE. (CROSS\r\n    SECTION.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--NYCE'S FRUIT PRESERVING HOUSE.\r\n    (LONGITUDINAL SECTION.)]\r\n\r\n(_A_) Foundation walls. The ground floor is leveled off, and made\r\nsolid, and even with the foundation walls. (_B_) A covering of _tar_\r\nand _pitch_, one-half inch thick, put over the ground and foundation\r\nwalls, to prevent the entrance of moisture. The tar and pitch should\r\nbe mixed so as to be only moderately hardened by the temperature of\r\nthe ground. (_D_) The filling between the walls is composed of short\r\ndry shavings, chaff, or other poor conductors, 3-½ feet thick, on the\r\nbottom and sides. (_C_) Joist for plank floor, 3-½ feet above the\r\nground. The floor is made level throughout. (_F_) Chloride of calcium,\r\nor _dried waste-bittern_, from salt works, spread on every part of the\r\nfloor of the preserving room, to absorb moisture. (_I I_) Air-tight\r\ncasings, made of common sheet-iron, No. 26; the edges thickly\r\npainted, and nailed to upright studding. The outer casing in some\r\nhouses is made of brick. The inside of the brick wall is covered with\r\nroofing cement, or pitch, or some other air-tight coating. (_K K_)\r\ndoors 6 or 8 inches thick, filled with chaff or shavings, and fitted\r\ntightly to the door-frames, by listing or cloth nailed over thin\r\nlayers of cotton. (_X_) The ice-chamber. (_L_) Joists to support the\r\nice floor, resting 2 inches on the posts at _Q_. (_N_) Iron bars, 1-¼\r\ninches wide, and ¼ inch thick, gained ½ inch into the joists, and\r\nplaced crosswise to them. A bar must always be put directly under the\r\nseams and rivets. Three bars are enough to be under a sheet 30 inches\r\nwide. (_M_) The galvanized-iron ice floor, No. 18 or 20; the edges\r\njoined with rivets not more than 1 inch apart, and very carefully\r\nsoldered. The ice floor is put on the edges of the iron bars so as to\r\nexpose every part of its surface, on which ice directly rests, to the\r\nair of the room below. (_S_) Sides of ice room made of upright\r\nplanks. Better have it lined with zinc or galvanized-iron, inside of\r\nthe plank. Scantling, 2 by 6 inches, are placed on the ice, 4 feet\r\napart, made even with the ice. Wide plank (_P_) are placed loose\r\nacross the scanting, the edges as close as may be put together, to\r\nprevent the filling falling on the ice. Saw-dust, 6 inches thick, is\r\nplaced on the plank (_P_). Shavings are not compact enough on the top\r\nto keep the air from the ice. (_O_) A discharge pipe to conduct the\r\nwater from the ice. (_W_) An ante-room with an ice-water trough,\r\n(_Y_), in which canned fruit is kept, in large stone crocks, for\r\nretailing by small measure.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--NYCE'S FRUIT PRESERVING HOUSE. (GROUND\r\n    PLAN.)]\r\n\r\nThe following estimates are given by the inventor, for a house, with\r\nroom 15 ft. square, 8 ft. high, 22 ft. square on outside, with\r\ncapacity for holding 500 bushels. The cost would be about as follows:\r\n\r\n  Common iron, at 7-½ cts. per lb., cost in the house         $210  00\r\n  Galvanized iron, No. 26, at 20 cts. per lb.                  105  00\r\n  Galvanized iron, No. 20, at 18 cts. per lb.                   80  00\r\n  Whole cost, probably                                         800  00\r\n\r\nThe frame and roof being simple, their cost need not exceed that of\r\nsimilar structures.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Bursting open of the pods, or of the hulls of nuts.\r\n\r\n[22] Balfour's Manual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nINSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the preparation of this work was undertaken, the author desired\r\nto make it as perfect as possible in all its parts. He very soon\r\ndiscovered, from his own observations in the orchard, that one of the\r\ngreatest difficulties we all have to contend against in fruit-growing,\r\nwas the ravages committed upon our fruits and fruit-trees by hosts of\r\nnoxious insects.\r\n\r\nHere then was a new branch of investigation, a new field of study to\r\nbe entered. He was not an entomologist, nor could he gain any\r\nassistance from his friends who were such, because, though they were\r\nscientific, and able to assist him in names and descriptions of the\r\ninsects presented, still they were not _practical entomologists_;\r\ntheir knowledge of these creatures was purely scientific, and while\r\nthey could descant learnedly upon the systems set up by the great\r\nmasters of the science, for the most perfect classification of\r\ninsects, they could render us practical men but little aid in\r\ncombatting our insect foes. Great assistance they have rendered,\r\nhowever, in providing names for all these wonderful creatures, in\r\ndescribing their habits and their economy, and in assigning them\r\nplaces in the beautiful classification that has been provided for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn turning from men to books, but little more assistance or\r\nencouragement was met with; these too would only give the names, the\r\nplaces, and the descriptions, in the most approved language of the\r\nscience, but they are not attractive nor intelligible to the\r\nunlearned. Any person can soon acquire the language of the science,\r\nwith a little study, but these scientific books do not give us\r\ndirections how to rid ourselves of the pests.\r\n\r\nAmong the books that are accessible and that are adapted to the\r\ngeneral reader, and to the student of practical entomology, two were\r\nfound of eminent utility as far as they went. These are the excellent\r\nreports to the Massachusetts and the New York Agricultural Societies,\r\nby Messrs. Harris and Fitch, which are clothed in popular language,\r\nand which treat particularly of the insects injurious to vegetation,\r\nand they put us in the way of combating our foes. The former, which\r\nhas been reprinted and illustrated in beautiful style, is worthy of a\r\nplace in every farmer's library, and will prove a valuable aid in the\r\nstudy: the latter is printed in connection with the Society's reports.\r\nTo both of these, the author acknowledges his indebtedness, and from\r\nboth has he drawn liberally.\r\n\r\nOther popular treatises, though attractive, have proved of very little\r\npractical value, and the student will find even the reports above\r\nreferred to imperfect, as they were prepared for a limited region,\r\nand do not mention several insects that are common in other parts of\r\nthe country than the States for which these reports were prepared. It\r\nwere much to be desired, that every State Society would have similar\r\nreports, respecting the insects, peculiar to its state.\r\n\r\nThus the author found himself compelled to investigate this broad\r\nfield of study for himself--it became necessary to grasp the elements\r\nof the classification, and to go into the field and the orchard, to\r\nuse his eyes, and to observe for himself. This was a labor of time,\r\nand required considerable effort; but it brought its own reward in the\r\npleasure attendant upon this delightful study. At the same time there\r\nwas great satisfaction in the thought that all these facts, gathered\r\nfrom the works of men of science, confirmed by personal observation,\r\nand rendered useful and applicable in practice by his fellow laborers\r\nin the garden and orchard, would be a valuable contribution to them,\r\nand would constitute a useful portion of the _American Pomology_ he\r\nwas then preparing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for himself, he has discovered that his collections, in\r\nthis department, covered several hundred pages of manuscript, and\r\nthat, if printed, they would render his volume too cumbrous. Upon\r\nconsulting with his publishers, it was concluded best to lay the\r\nmatter aside, for the present at least, and to prepare anew a brief\r\naccount of some of the insects most injurious to the orchard, with\r\nshort suggestions as to the best methods of combating their ravages.\r\nThis conclusion has been the more readily yielded to, because the\r\npublic now have a medium of communication with the scientific\r\nentomologists, which well supplies the great want we had begun to\r\nexperience. I refer to a monthly publication, issued by the\r\nEntomological Society of Philadelphia, in which the questions, that\r\nare constantly occurring to farmers, are answered in the most simple,\r\nclear, and satisfactory manner.[23] Besides this, we find in our best\r\nagricultural journals, a page or a column, devoted to the\r\nconsideration of insects injurious to vegetation.[24]\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenience and system, these notes will be presented\r\nin the order of the approved classification of insects. Omitting\r\nfurther introduction or discourse upon the wonderful instincts and\r\nhabits of insects, and explanation of their metamorphoses and the\r\nprinciples of classification, and confessing my poor qualification for\r\nthe task, let us proceed at once to the catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COLEOPTERA.=--BEETLES.\r\n\r\nIn this class of insects we find both, friends and foes. The former\r\nassist us by their voracious appetites, that can only be satisfied\r\nwith gourmandizing upon other insects, particularly the juicy bodies\r\nof their larvæ. The latter embrace some of our most troublesome pests,\r\nespecially as they consume vegetable matters, in the perfect as well\r\nas in the larval condition, and in both stages are exceedingly\r\nvoracious. Moreover, they generally commit their depredations under\r\ncover, or at night. Some live in the soil and consume the roots of our\r\nplants, and others mine their way into the solid wood of the stems of\r\nour finest trees; while some only affect the twigs and smaller\r\nbranches, and others devour the foliage, flowers, and fruits. A few of\r\nthe most familiar and troublesome of these will now be introduced; and\r\nallusion will also be made to some of those which befriend us by their\r\ndestruction of other insects.\r\n\r\n=Saperda bivittata.= (_Say._)--The Apple Tree Borer.--This is a\r\nnocturnal insect, which has been found very destructive to our\r\norchards. The female deposits one egg in a place, generally low down\r\non the stem of the tree; this hatches, and enters the tissues of the\r\nbark, where it feeds for a time, a footless grub. As it grows, it\r\nburrows deeper, and upward, until it reaches the sap wood, upon which\r\nit feeds. When half grown, it burrows still deeper, and upwards into\r\nthe heart of the tree, and then outward through the sap wood to the\r\nbark, but retires again toward the centre, as to a place of safety, to\r\nundergo its transformation, after packing the hole with shreds of wood\r\nand with its castings to make its retreat secure. In the spring, the\r\nperfect insect opens its way outward, and emerges to the light of day.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--Observe the bark of young trees very closely during the\r\nsummer, to discover the castings that are ejected; notice the\r\ndiscolored or depressed portions of bark, and cut into them to find\r\nand destroy the worm--if it has penetrated the solid wood, pursue it\r\nwith a piece of stout but flexible wire.\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVES.--Alkaline washes have been highly recommended, as a means\r\nof driving away the mother beetle; soft soap may be used, and a\r\nportion of soft or hard soap, placed in the forks of the branches,\r\nwill dissolve with the rains, and wash down on the bark. These\r\napplications, to be efficacious, should be made in May or June. In\r\nAugust, the bark should be examined, and when the worms are cut out,\r\nthe soap suds may be injected with advantage, especially if the larvæ\r\nhave not been reached. Birds should be encouraged, particularly the\r\nPicæ tribe, which destroy many grubs of the wood-boring insects.\r\n\r\n=Chrysobothris femorata=, or the Thick-legged Buprestris, is another\r\nkind of apple-tree borer, very common in some parts of the West. The\r\nperfect insect may be seen running up and down the stems of our trees,\r\nin June and July. It is a blackish beetle, about half an inch long.\r\nThe hole, bored by the grub, is flat, and not cylindrical like that of\r\nthe _Saperda_. This beetle attacks the stem higher up than the\r\n_Saperda_, but burrows under the bark, and then sinks into the wood\r\nmuch in the same way.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES and PREVENTIVES are similar to those above mentioned. Seek\r\nfor the young worms in their shallow burrows in August, before they\r\nhave gone deeply into the tree.\r\n\r\n=Dicerca divaricata=, (_Say._), or the Cherry-tree Borer, is similar\r\nin its habit of boring in the sap wood under the bark, and may be\r\ncombated in the same way. The perfect insect appears in June and July.\r\n\r\n=Prenocerus supernotatus=, or the American Currant Borer, feeds upon\r\nthe pith of the stalk. The larva is a small, white grub, which changes\r\ninto a slender, long-horned beetle; black, edged with chestnut-brown.\r\nThe wing covers are marked with two small grey dots, anteriorly, and a\r\ncrescent-shaped one behind the middle.\r\n\r\nIt is very injurious to the currant bushes in many parts of the\r\ncountry, and constitutes a serious obstacle to growing the plants to\r\na single stem, tree fashion. In the bush form of this plant, the\r\nconstant reproduction of new shoots compensates for the destruction\r\ncaused by the borer.\r\n\r\nThere is another currant borer, an European, which is confined to\r\nyoung shoots; as it is not the larva of a beetle, but of a butterfly,\r\nit will be treated in its proper place.\r\n\r\n=Bostrichus bicaudatus=, or the Apple-twig Borer, affects the small\r\ntwigs, and when numerous, will produce an effect like that called\r\ntwig-blight, by causing the death of the part and the withering of the\r\nleaves, at mid-summer. A small hole will be found near the axil of a\r\nleaf; this turns with the twig, and often extends several inches along\r\nthe pith. The insect is a small, chestnut-brown beetle, 0.25 to 0.35\r\nof an inch long, and is characterized by two projections or horns at\r\nthe hinder end. Has been found rather common from Michigan to Kansas.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--Kill, when found.\r\n\r\n=Scolytus pyri=, or the Pear-blight Beetle, affects twigs of pear,\r\napple, and other fruits, which wither and die at mid-summer. Small\r\nperforations, like pin holes, will be found, and issuing from them\r\nsmall cylindrical beetles of a deep brown or black color.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--not known.\r\n\r\n=Lucanus dama=, or Horn-beetle, is a large insect, the larvæ of which\r\nare said to feed upon the trunk and roots of old apple and other\r\ntrees. The perfect insects are of a dark mahogany color, smooth, and\r\npolished. Like other Stag-beetles, they fly at night, are not very\r\nharmful, and are believed to be several years in reaching the perfect\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n=Leptostylus aculiferus=, bores under the bark of apple trees. It is a\r\nshort, thick, brownish-gray beetle, with thorns upon its wing-covers;\r\nhence, the scientific name of needle-bearer. Length, 0.35 inch;\r\nseason, August. The larvæ are small worms, occurring in multitudes\r\nunder the bark, and making long-winding burrows.\r\n\r\n=Tomicus mali=, or the Apple-bark Beetle, is described by Dr. Fitch as\r\nnew. He says, it is a small, smooth, black or chestnut-red,\r\ncylindrical beetle; the larvæ feed under the bark, and then enter the\r\nwood, killing the young tree.\r\n\r\n=Conotrachelus Nenuphar=, (_Herbst_), is the noted and notorious and\r\nyet little known Plum Weevil, that is such an abomination to plum\r\nplanters, and which has proved very injurious to our peaches and is\r\neven accused of producing deformities in our pears and apples.\r\n\r\nThe egg is deposited in the fruit, where it soon hatches and feeds,\r\napproaching the stone. This causes the fruit to fall, and when the\r\ngrub has attained its full size it descends into the ground to perform\r\nits transformation. The perfect insect, a small, dark-gray beetle,\r\neither crawls up the stem, or flies to the trees. Mr. Walsh reminds us\r\nthat Dr. Trimble has found these insects hybernating in sheltered\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.--It is lamentable that we have been able to do so little to\r\nprevent the ravages of this insect. The plan of shaking off, and\r\ndestroying the affected fruits, promises the best results, by\r\ndiminishing the next crop. It was suggested by David Thomas, of New\r\nYork, but is most successfully practised by Dr. E.S. Hull, of\r\nIllinois, who has invented an inverted umbrella on wheels, which\r\nreceives the insects, as well as the defective fruits, when it is\r\nbumped against the trees. By the use of this, he is enabled to harvest\r\nsplendid crops of stone-fruits.\r\n\r\n=Pomphopoea Sayi=, (or _Cantharis pyrivora_, of _Fitch_), is called by\r\nhim the Pear Blister-fly. He describes it as a long blistering beetle,\r\nof a green-blue color; found on a pear tree about the first of June,\r\neating the young fruit voraciously.\r\n\r\n=Euryomia Inda=, or the Indian Cetonia, is a beetle about six-tenths\r\nof an inch long. The head and thorax dark, copper-brown, thickly\r\ncovered with short, greenish-yellow hairs; wing-cases light\r\nyellowish-brown, changeable, with metallic tints. These are called\r\nflower-beetles, because they consume the pollen, and bury themselves\r\nin our flowers; but in the autumn, they consume our choicest fruits,\r\nespecially peaches.\r\n\r\n=Lachnosterna fusca=, (_Froelich_), is the White Grub, or May Beetle.\r\nA heavy brown insect, an inch or more in length, which makes its\r\nappearance with the first warm evenings, when the Black Locust begins\r\nto open its fragrant blossoms, to which these beetles are attracted.\r\nThey also attack the foliage of other trees, particularly the cherry,\r\nwhich they entirely strip of leaves and fruit. Though very destructive\r\nin the perfect form, these insects are most to be dreaded while in the\r\nlarval condition, which is supposed to continue for some years. They\r\nthen work under cover, and can only be traced by the ravages they\r\ncommit. Every strawberry grower is familiar with the large White Grub\r\nthat so often destroys his hopes of a crop, by killing the plants\r\nwhen in full growth and fruitage, by cutting off all the fibres.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--The full-grown insects are very busy in the evening, but\r\nbecome stupid and lethargic before morning, clinging to the leaves and\r\ntwigs, when they may be shaken down, caught on sheets, gathered, and\r\ndestroyed. If let alone, they will fall to the ground toward day\r\nbreak, and secrete themselves in the grass and soil until night. All\r\nthat can be killed in this stage of their existence, the better, as\r\nthis will prevent the deposition of innumerable eggs. The White Grubs\r\nmust be destroyed one at a time in cultivated grounds; kill them\r\nwhenever found. Encourage chickens and birds to follow the plow and\r\nspade, as they will consume great numbers. Hogs will find and eat them\r\ngreedily, and may be allowed to root them out even from a meadow, if\r\nbadly affected; for, though a harsh remedy, it is not so bad as the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n=Pelidnota punctata=, or the Spotted Pelidnota, is a large yellowish\r\ninsect, with a black dot on each side of the thorax, and three others\r\non the outer side of each wing-cover. It is found in the day time,\r\nupon the leaves of the grape vine. Like the rest of the tribe, these\r\ninsects are voracious, and the grubs may also feed upon the roots of\r\nthe grape; therefore they had better be destroyed, though as their\r\nnumbers are seldom large they are not found to be very injurious.\r\n\r\n=Haltica chalybea=, or the Grape Vine Flea-beetle, appears early in\r\nthe season, and eats holes in the buds and leaves. It is small, 0.16\r\ninch long, oval; shining, deep greenish-blue, or deep green, or\r\npurple. This insect spends the winter in the earth about the roots of\r\nthe vine, and feeds upon them.\r\n\r\n=Anomala lucicola=, or the light-loving Anomala, is found on the grape\r\nvine in July. It resembles the May Beetle, but is smaller, being 0.35\r\ninch long.\r\n\r\nThese are not all the beetles that feed upon the grape vine.\r\n\r\n=Macrodactylus subspinosa=, or the Rose-chafer, is another\r\nmelolonthian beetle, which is exceedingly destructive to grapes and\r\nvarious other plants in many parts of the country, in May and June.\r\nThis insect is smaller than the others of its group, but is equally\r\ndestructive as a leaf-eater, on account of its numbers. On the grape,\r\nit cuts off the young bunch of buds and blossoms, and thus seriously\r\ndiminishes the crop, as well as by destroying the foliage. It is of a\r\nbuff-yellow, with black feet, about 0.33 inch long. They continue to\r\nravage vegetation about a month, and then retire into the ground, an\r\ninch deep, and deposit their eggs, which hatch in about twenty days,\r\nand the young grubs feed upon tender roots, attaining their full size,\r\nthree-quarters of an inch, before winter, when they descend deeper to\r\nhybernate.\r\n\r\nThe Rose-beetle has many natural enemies, among which are the\r\nDragon-flies; but we must depend upon human efforts for their\r\ndestruction, an almost hopeless task, for their name is legion, but so\r\nmuch the greater necessity for the effort, and as they are sluggish,\r\nthey may easily be caught and thrown into hot water, or otherwise\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n=Tree Pruners= are the larvæ of beetles that excavate a burrow in\r\nsmall limbs of trees, so as to make a section almost across their\r\nsubstance; most of them then bore upward into the limb, and await the\r\naction of the winds to break off the part and waft them to the ground,\r\nwhere they pass through their change to the perfect insect. They\r\nexercise a wonderful instinct in leaving just fibres enough to support\r\nthe branch until they are ready for their descent, but it often\r\nhappens that the twig breaks off partially and hangs by a thread,\r\ndying, of course; we see the brown leaves on the trees, and this is\r\nthe first indication of the presence of the insects. If we examine the\r\nfallen spray, we shall be surprised to observe the cause of its\r\nfalling. In the case of the oak tree, the damage is done by the\r\n_Elaphidion villosum_, (Fabricius), a long-horned beetle. The larva\r\nremains in these twigs until the next season, hence the importance of\r\ngathering and burning all that fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nAn insect of somewhat similar habits often cuts off stout shoots of\r\nthe Hickory, making a very neat section of a small limb, leaving only\r\nthe bark, so that it readily breaks off with the wind; and a similar\r\neffect has been observed in strong annual shoots of the pear, toward\r\nthe end of summer. The fallen piece and the stump are cut as neatly as\r\nby the shears, but no perforation is discovered along the axis, in\r\nwhich the larva could be concealed; hence we have but to suffer the\r\ntrimming thus performed without our will, and look upon it as a sort\r\nof natural shortening-in of our trees.\r\n\r\n=Blister-flies, or Beetles.=--There are several species of these\r\ninsects, each of which appears to have its favorite pasturage. They\r\nare exceedingly voracious, but confine themselves chiefly to the\r\ndestruction of herbaceous vegetation, and are therefore obnoxious to\r\nthe farmer and gardener, who know them as the potato insects, than to\r\nthe fruit-grower. Their appetites are not very discriminating,\r\nhowever, and when they are abundant they may consume the foliage of\r\nour trees. These Blister-flies belong to the genus _Lytta_, and are\r\nused as a substitute for the Spanish-fly of Europe, as they are\r\npossessed of blistering qualities in no mean degree. They are wholly\r\ndifferent from the new potato destroyer of the West, the _Doryphora\r\n10-lineata_, which is hemispherical, and is a leaf-eater, in the\r\nlarval as well as in the perfect state.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--Catch and kill all that can be found in the garden, or potato\r\nfield; scald, dry, and sell to the apothecary.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this section, it is but due to our many insect friends\r\nin this order, to introduce a few of them to the reader. There are\r\nseveral large families that are really serviceable to man; some of\r\nthese are called Scavengers, because they consume large quantities of\r\ndecaying matter that might prove noxious to us, were it allowed to\r\ndecay upon the surface of the ground. Among these are the\r\nDung-beetles, and the Carrion-beetles: others are carnivorous, and\r\nsome of these are called _Cicindelidæ_, or Tiger-beetles, from their\r\nvoracious consumption of other insects, which they devour in great\r\nnumbers, both in their larval and in their perfect form. These day\r\nbeetles are large, brightly colored, and very active in their\r\nmovements, as they run about in the sunny paths and roads, and cannot\r\nfail to attract attention. Few persons are aware, however, of the\r\nvaluable aid they are rendering to man, nor of the credit that is due\r\nto them for the preservation of our crops from the invasion of other\r\ninsect foes. Too often they are either unobserved and overlooked, or\r\neven treated with the aversion and cruelty of men who ignorantly\r\nattempt to stamp out all insect life, as though these creatures were\r\nintruders upon their preemption. The intelligent observer of nature\r\nwill soon learn to respect each aid, which has been so wisely\r\nfurnished to assist him in his labors as a cultivator of the soil, and\r\nall may admire the Wisdom that has provided at the same time such\r\nbeautiful and such useful creatures for the work.\r\n\r\n=Calosoma scrutator=, is well named the handsome, for it is one of our\r\nmost beautiful insects of this class. This, and the red-spotted _C.\r\ncalidum_, may be seen upon trees, seeking caterpillars, upon which\r\nthey feed. One of our most intelligent horticulturists has so high an\r\nappreciation of these insects, that he will not allow them to be\r\ndisturbed, and whenever he sees any caterpillars in his orchard, he\r\ntakes these beetles to the tree, and gives himself no further concern,\r\nknowing that the Calosoma will soon destroy every worm.\r\n\r\n=Coccinelidæ=, or Lady-birds, are most valuable aids to the\r\ncultivator, who is constantly liable to have his crops destroyed by\r\nthe various species of Aphides. These little hemispherical beetles are\r\nfamiliar to every one, and known to the children as Lady-birds; but\r\nall may not know their value, nor be so well acquainted with the larvæ\r\nof these insects, which are the chief agents in the destruction of our\r\ntroublesome plant-lice. Most persons would be very apt to crush these\r\ncurious, diminutive, lizard-looking creatures, even at the time they\r\nwere attacking the Aphides, instead of leaving them to carry on the\r\nwarfare more effectually without our aid.\r\n\r\nThese little friends have had a superstitious regard shown to them in\r\nmany countries, which indicates that a glimmering idea prevailed\r\nrespecting their usefulness. The Germans call them the _Marienkaefer_,\r\nor Lady-beetles, of the Virgin Mary. The French call them _Vaches de\r\nDieu_, the Lord's cows, and our own children are all familiar with the\r\nnursery rhyme about the Lady-birds. These insects find their way to\r\ntrees or plants that are infested with their proper food, the Aphides.\r\n\r\nThese beetles hide under the leaves that cluster in sheltered nooks\r\nabout or between the large roots of forest trees, where they can be\r\nfound on any mild winter day, and may be carried to the green-house or\r\nto the window plants that are infested with plant-lice. They will not\r\nonly devour these pests, but will soon lay eggs that hatch and produce\r\nthe larvæ which are so voracious as to clear the plants in a\r\nshort-time. A little attention to the habits of these insects may\r\nspare us great losses from the plant-lice.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ORTHOPTERA.=--GRASSHOPPERS.\r\n\r\nThe insects of this order have an imperfect transformation. The eggs\r\nhatch at once into young insects, that resemble their parents in form\r\nand habits, excepting that they do not get their wings till they\r\napproach the adult state. The young consume food voraciously, and the\r\nperfect insects are not only still more hungry, but, having increased\r\npowers of locomotion, they are more widely destructive. These are the\r\ntrue _Locusts_, and though chiefly injurious to the farm and garden,\r\ninfesting the meadows and corn-fields, the grasshoppers, when winged,\r\noften attack the foliage of our young orchard trees toward the end of\r\nsummer. But when we contemplate the invasion of the great western\r\nplague, belonging to this order, which rivals that terrible scourge,\r\nthe Locust of the eastern continent, in numbers and voracity, we may\r\nwell dread their increase and appearance in other parts of the\r\ncountry. The grasshoppers that have invaded Kansas and other Western\r\nStates are, like all the rest of this group of _Orthoptera_, true\r\nLocusts.\r\n\r\nThis order is called _Orthoptera_, from their straight wings; it\r\nembraces several groups, cockroaches, crickets, grasshoppers, or\r\nlocusts, etc., which are all injurious, except the _Mantis_, which is\r\npredacious, and therefore useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n=HEMIPTERA.=--BUGS AND HARVEST-FLIES.\r\n\r\nThis order contains many insects that are injurious to the nurseryman,\r\nto the orchardist, and to the gardener. They are characterized by\r\nhaving a proboscis instead of a mouth with jaws; they can suck, but\r\nthey cannot bite. The proboscis is often horny, and armed with two\r\npair of bristles, when it becomes a more formidable weapon for attack.\r\nBugs have four wings; they do not pass through the usual metamorphoses\r\nof insect life; but are born with legs and feeding apparatus like the\r\nperfect insects, except that some have no wings. Bugs are all\r\ninjurious to man, excepting such as are predacious, which are\r\nserviceable by destroying other insects. Many are very small; and yet\r\ntheir countless numbers and wonderful fecundity enable them to do\r\nimmense damage, as is true of the _Aphides_ and _Coccidæ_, the\r\n_Tingis_, the _Tettigonia vitis_, called the Thrips by our\r\nvine-dressers; and still more so of the Chinch-bug of the Western\r\nprairies, which destroys whole crops of our most important cereals.\r\n\r\nThe colored juice of some bugs is used in the arts. The coccus of the\r\nprickly pear, in Central America, is gathered and dried to form the\r\ncochineal of the shops.\r\n\r\nHemipterous insects are divided into two groups. True bugs, called\r\n_Hemiptera heteroptera_, having the wing-covers opaque at the base,\r\nand laid horizontally, and crossing each other obliquely at the end,\r\noverlapping; and the Harvest-flies, such as Plant-lice and Bark-lice.\r\nThese, the _Hemiptera homoptera_, have the wing-covers of one texture\r\nthroughout, not horizontal, but more or less sloping, and not crossing\r\none another behind. Among these, which all feed upon plants, some very\r\ntroublesome pests will here be noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COCCIDIANS.=--BARK-LICE.\r\n\r\n=Aspidiotus conchiformis=, or the Apple Bark-louse, is very numerous\r\nin many parts of our country, particularly north of latitude 40\r\ndegrees. It commits sad devastations in some sections. Individually,\r\nit is but a little scale; but these animals are wonderfully prolific\r\nand soon cover every twig of the tree, obstructing its transpirations,\r\nand abstracting its vital juices; the leaves, and even the fruit are\r\noverrun with these miserable scales, but the twigs are their favorite\r\nresort. These scales are oblong, shaped like an oyster shell; flat\r\nand brown, often crowding upon one another. In the winter and spring,\r\nthey contain or cover a number of small, round, white eggs, which\r\nhatch out in the spring, in May, attach themselves to the bark, and\r\nabsorb the juices: various remedies have been suggested, and more or\r\nless thoroughly tested. The restoration of the thrifty growth of the\r\ntree is considered essential to success; and without this, all\r\nremedies are looked upon as unavailing. Some orchardists think that\r\nthorough drainage and cultivation of the land would alone banish the\r\nlice, but this can hardly be hoped. Strong lye, or solutions of\r\npotash, or soda, white-wash, and sulphur, have been used, and tobacco\r\nboiled in lye, soft-soap and tar mixed with linseed oil, which makes a\r\nkind of varnish. Mr. Walsh tells us that applications, to destroy this\r\ninsect, are better made in May or June, as the eggs are protected by\r\nthe scale in winter, and it is impermeable to watery solutions. This\r\npest has been imported from Europe. Walsh recommends the use of\r\nLady-birds to check the Bark-lice.[25]\r\n\r\n=Lecanium pyri=, (_Fitch_), or the Pear Bark-louse, is a hemispherical\r\nbrown scale, as large as a split pea. They may be found in summer on\r\nthe under side of the limbs, and are the remains of dead females,\r\nwhich cover the eggs and young brood. This insect would be very\r\ninjurious, were it to increase in numbers considerably. Let young\r\ntrees be examined in June, when the scales may easily be found,\r\nremoved, and destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Lecanium persici=, or the Peach Bark-louse, is described, by Fitch,\r\nas similar in size to the above, found on smooth bark near a bud; it\r\nis blackish, uneven, shining, with a pale margin.\r\n\r\nAnother pear tree bark-louse was described by the lamented A.O. Moore,\r\nof New York, as a white, papery scale, giving a claret-colored juice\r\nwhen scraped. This, in the winter, consists of a defunct mother and\r\nher brood of eggs, the breaking of which gives the color. Alkaline\r\nwashes are recommended to be applied in the spring. Mr. Walsh thinks\r\nthis insect cannot be the same as that mentioned by Dr. Harris, on p.\r\n222 of his report, under the name of _Coccus cryptogamus_, (_Dalman_),\r\nwho found it upon the Aspen, and therefore he has named it _Coccus?\r\nHarrisii_.[26]\r\n\r\n=Lecanium vitis=, (_Linn._), or the Vine Bark-louse, is mentioned by\r\nFitch as having been found on grape vines in June. It is hemispherical\r\nand brown. A cottony substance was extruded from one end of the scale,\r\nand this increased until July, when minute insects crept out and\r\nscattered over the bark, upon which they fixed themselves. This insect\r\nis not very common, but its first appearance should be closely\r\nwatched, and its destruction promptly effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n=APHIDES.=--PLANT-LICE.\r\n\r\nThese are the most extraordinary insects, being found upon almost all\r\nparts of plants, and there is scarcely a species which does not\r\nsupport one or more kinds peculiar to itself. Then they are so\r\nexceedingly prolific! Reaumur proved that one individual, in five\r\ngenerations, may become the progenitor of nearly six thousand millions\r\nof descendants. Most of these insects, which we find so abundant upon\r\nour trees, are wingless females. Winged insects, both male and female,\r\nappear later in the season, and after laying their eggs, they soon\r\nperish. Some lay in the fall, others wait till spring. When these eggs\r\nhatch, the brood consists wholly of females, which are wingless, and\r\ndo not lay eggs, but are viviparous and produce from fifteen to twenty\r\nyoung lice in the course of a day. This second generation are also\r\nwingless, and at maturity produce their young, and so on to the\r\nseventh generation, without the approach of a single male, until the\r\nautumn, when a brood of males and females appears, which are both\r\nwinged at maturity, and then the eggs are laid for the next year's\r\nbrood, and the parents die.[27]\r\n\r\nThe injuries occasioned by plant-lice, are much greater than would at\r\nfirst be expected, from an observation of the small size and extreme\r\nweakness of the insects; but these make up by their numbers what they\r\nlack in strength individually, and thus become formidable enemies to\r\nvegetation. By their punctures and the quantity of sap they draw from\r\nthe leaves, the functions of these important organs are deranged, or\r\ninterrupted, the sap is withdrawn or contaminated, and unfitted to\r\nsupply the wants of vegetation. Plants are differently affected; some\r\nwither and cease to grow, their leaves and stems become sickly, and\r\ndie from exhaustion. Others, not killed, are greatly impeded in their\r\ngrowth; the tender parts, which are attacked, become stunted and\r\ncurled. The punctures of the lice appear to poison some plants,\r\nproducing warts or swellings, which are sometimes solid, sometimes\r\nhollow, containing within them a swarm of lice, descendants of a\r\nsingle individual.[28] These last are often seen upon the leaves of\r\nthe Elm, and upon some Poplars, and other trees; but I have not found\r\nany upon the foliage of our cultivated fruits, unless it be those on\r\nthe grape.\r\n\r\n=Aphis mali=, or the Apple Leaf-louse, is a small, green insect\r\nwithout wings, accompanied by a few black and green ones having wings.\r\nThese are all crowded together upon the green tips of twigs, and under\r\nthe leaves, sucking the sap. The eggs remain in deep cracks of the\r\nbark during the winter, and hatch as soon as the buds expand in the\r\nspring. The most successful treatment is to scrape off the loose bark,\r\nand to apply to the stems of the trees alkaline or lime washes. Many\r\nof our familiar little winter birds consume these eggs. In the spring\r\nand summer, alkaline solutions may be used with advantage, syringed or\r\nsprinkled upon the affected shoots and foliage.\r\n\r\nThe smell of these insects is peculiar, which, indeed, is generally\r\ncharacteristic with bugs. Each sort seems to derive a special flavor\r\nfrom the tree or plant upon which it feeds. Most insects of this\r\nfamily secrete copiously a sweetish fluid, called the honey dew, which\r\nis ejected from two little horns or nectaries, that project, one on\r\neach side of their bodies. This sweet material attracts a great many\r\nflies, and other insects, particularly ants, which are the constant\r\nattendants of these creatures, and are said to protect them from their\r\nenemies in order to obtain their sweet secretion. Some entomologists\r\nhave called _Aphides_ the Ants' cows.\r\n\r\nNo one, who is acquainted with the _Aphides_, and the various insects\r\nwhich prey upon them, will ever permit a valuable plant to suffer\r\ninjury from these pests. He will collect some of the _Aphis'_ enemies\r\nalive, carry them to the affected plant, and set them free to do their\r\nwork; there they will remain while the food lasts. The _Aphides_ have\r\nmore numerous, more active, and more inveterate enemies than insects\r\nof any other group--these are the means by which their wonderful\r\nfecundity is kept in check. Among them are the Aphis-lions, which are\r\nthe larvæ of the Golden-eyed and Lace-wing flies, belonging to the\r\norder _Neuroptera_. They are reddish-brown, with a dark stripe down\r\nthe middle, and a cream-colored one on each side; bodies long, narrow,\r\nand wrinkled transversely. Their jaws are long, curved like sickles,\r\nprojecting forward from their heads horizontally.[29]\r\n\r\nThe _Coccinellidæ_, mentioned as useful members of the order\r\n_Coleoptera_, on a previous page, are among the most active enemies of\r\nthe _Aphides_. The eggs are laid in clusters of twenty to forty on the\r\nunder side of a leaf, to which they are closely glued; they are oval,\r\nand light yellow. They hatch into small blackish larvæ, which are\r\nactive, and which boldly attack an _Aphis_ much larger than\r\nthemselves, leaving only the empty skin. They consume hundreds while\r\nin the larval state, about two weeks, when they attach themselves by\r\nthe tail, and go into the pupa state. One of the largest of these\r\nLady-birds is the _Mysia 15-punctata_; the larva is a clear white,\r\nthe middle of the back tinged with red, and two or three black spots\r\non each segment--nearly a hundred species of Lady-birds are found in\r\nthis country. The perfect insect, as well as the larvæ, feed upon\r\n_Aphides_, and instead of being destroyed, they should be cherished\r\nand encouraged.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are other inveterate enemies of the plant-lice in\r\nthe _Syrphidæ_, which are two-winged flies, resembling the common\r\nhouse-fly, but handsomer. They deposit their eggs where _Aphides_\r\nexist; the maggot, which hatches from these, seizes upon the first\r\n_Aphis_ that comes within his reach, and sucks its fluids. A\r\nmedium-sized worm will consume a hundred lice in an hour. They are\r\nalways found in a colony of _Aphides_.[30]\r\n\r\n=Aphis prunifoliæ=, or the Plum Leaf-louse, is black, with pale green\r\nabdomen. It is found on the under side of the leaves, which become\r\nwrinkled and distorted. It is not so abundant as some other species,\r\nbut its habits are similar.[31]\r\n\r\n=Aphis cerasi=, (_Fabric._), or the Cherry Plant-louse, is very\r\ncommon, very numerous, and very black. They appear with the first\r\nexpansion of the leaves, and continue or are renewed when destroyed,\r\nand remain until mid-summer, when they generally disappear. Their\r\nnumbers are almost incredible, and they give a young cherry tree a\r\nwretched appearance. On the under surface of a small leaf,\r\nthree-fourths of an inch long, Mr. Fitch counted one hundred and\r\nninety lice, on one side only of the midrib. Their natural enemies\r\ncome to the rescue to check their wonderful increase, and sometimes\r\nwill utterly rout the _Aphides_ in a single week.[32]\r\n\r\nThe remedies advised for the apple tree _Aphides_, are equally\r\napplicable to those of the cherry, and their natural enemies are the\r\nsame and equally efficacious; but _Aphides_ have internal foes\r\nlikewise, that may be named here. The Ichneumon-flies are parasitic,\r\ntheir larvæ feed upon the substance of the _Aphides_. The genus\r\n_Aphidius_ is particularly provided to furnish parasites to these\r\ninsects, in which they deposit a single egg selecting a louse of the\r\nproper size to sustain their progeny: the egg hatches to a larva,\r\nwhich exhausts the _Aphis_ by the time it has attained its growth,\r\nwhen the poor creature fastens itself securely to the leaf, and dies,\r\nleaving its carcase a secure resting place for the pupa of the\r\nIchneumon. These parasitic-insects, which feed internally upon the\r\n_Aphides_, are as effective in their destruction as the Aphis-lions,\r\nor any other class of their enemies.[33]\r\n\r\n=Aphis persicæ=, or the Peach Tree-louse, punctures the leaves of this\r\nplant, and Dr. Fitch[34] thinks, is the common though not the only\r\ncause of the curl in the peach tree leaves. Our intelligent\r\norchardists have found these insects occasionally in the curled leaves\r\nof the peach, but do not agree with this distinguished entomologist,\r\nin considering them a cause of that malady.\r\n\r\n=Aphis vitis?=, or the Vine _Aphis_, is often quite troublesome on\r\nvigorous young shoots of the grape vine, both wild and cultivated,\r\nparticularly the former. These insects soon cripple the growth of the\r\nshoot. The species is not known to be different from that of Europe.\r\nThis insect is briefly mentioned by T. Glover, in Patent Office Rept.\r\nfor 1854, p. 79. Dr. Fitch describes as a grape leaf-louse, the\r\n_Pemphigus vitifolia_, which inhabits the gall-like excrescences upon\r\nthe foliage of some varieties, particularly those with thin leaves.\r\n\r\n=Aphis ribis=, (_Linn._), is the _Aphis_ of the currant. It causes the\r\nleaves to present a blistered appearance above; the lice are found on\r\nthe under side; the wingless are pale yellow, the others have glossy\r\nwings, mostly black, with abdomen light green.[35]\r\n\r\n=Aphis lanigera=, now called _Eriosoma_, or the Woolly _Aphis_, was\r\nfirst described in 1801 as infesting the apple trees in Germany. It\r\nhas been noticed in England in 1787, and has since acquired the name\r\nof American Blight, from the erroneous supposition that it had been\r\nimported from this country; but it was known to French gardeners for a\r\nlong time previous.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this insect are microscopic, and are enveloped in a\r\ncottony substance. They are deposited in chinks of bark, and crotches\r\nof limbs, at or near the surface of the ground. When first hatched,\r\nthe insects are covered with short down; as they grow, the down\r\nincreases in length. When fully grown, they are one-tenth of an inch\r\nlong; the head, antennæ, sucker, and skins, are blackish, the abdomen\r\nof a honey-yellow color. Their punctures produce warty excrescences,\r\nthe limbs become sickly, the leaves turn yellow and drop off, and the\r\nwhole tree perishes as the insects spread over it. The remedies\r\nappear futile on badly affected trees. Young trees were treated by\r\npainting over the affected parts with a mixture of melted resin and\r\nfish oil, in equal parts, applied warm. Sir Joseph Banks removed them\r\nwith a stiff brush. Spirits of tar, turpentine, oil, and soft soap,\r\nhave been recommended. After scraping off the rough bark, wash the\r\ntree with alkaline solution, apply the same to the main roots after\r\nlaying them bare of earth.[36]\r\n\r\n=Phemphigus pyri=, _Eriosoma pyri_, (_Fitch_), or _Pemphigus\r\nAmericanus?_, (_Walker_), is the Apple-root Blight. It produces a\r\nsimilar condition in the roots, and was also called the American\r\nBlight in England. It is composed of warty excrescences upon the\r\nroots, containing in their crevices minute lice, having their bodies\r\ncovered with a white cottony substance. Removal of the earth, and the\r\napplication of soapsuds, has been recommended as a probable remedy for\r\nthe injuries done by this insect.[37]\r\n\r\n=Psylla Pyri.=--Some _Aphides_ have the power of leaping, like the\r\nleaf-hoppers, but they differ from those insects in having very large\r\ntransparent upper wings, which cover the sides of the body like a\r\nsteep roof. The genus embracing these insects, is called _Psylla_. One\r\nof the species was observed by Dr. Harris, upon a pear tree. They live\r\nby suction, and having gorged themselves, the juice runs down on the\r\nbark, producing a blackish color; young trees suffered excessively. As\r\nDr. Phumb, of Salisbury, Conn., had observed them in 1833 on some\r\nimported pear trees, of which he lost several hundred in a few years,\r\nDr. Harris suspected the insect to be the _Psylla pyri_, of Europe.\r\nKollar recommends brushing off the insects, and crushing them under\r\nfoot; and also advises to destroy the winged females in the spring.\r\nThis being tedious and uncertain, it is recommended to wash the twigs\r\nwith a brush, dipped in a mixture of strong soapsuds and flowers of\r\nsulphur, before the buds expand, to deter the insects from laying\r\ntheir eggs. A weaker solution, or the whale oil soap, might kill the\r\nyoung insects after they have fastened upon the bark, if applied with\r\na syringe.[38]\r\n\r\n=Cicada septendecim=, or the Seventeen-year Locust, as it is\r\nerroneously called, is no Locust at all, but should be called\r\n_Cicada_, because, as already stated, when considering the order\r\n_Orthoptera_, the true Locusts, are, what we call Grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nThis insect is remarkable for the long period of its pupal existence,\r\nwhich is subterranean, and during which it feeds upon the juices of\r\nroots. In its perfect state, it does not eat, and is neither able to\r\nbite nor to sting. The injury it does to our orchards is effected by\r\nits piercer in depositing its eggs, causing twigs to break and fall\r\noff. There are several Harvest-flies that belong to this order.\r\n\r\n=Tree Hoppers=, being members of the same order, feed upon the juices\r\nof plants, through their suckers, and are thus injurious; but their\r\nnumbers are not sufficient to render them of much consequence.\r\n\r\n=Palæothrips mali=, (_Fitch_), is the name of an insect described by\r\nDr. Fitch[39] as infesting apple trees in the month of August, where\r\nthey were attacking the fruit. They excavated a little hollow near the\r\nblossom end of the apple about the size of a pea, which was occupied\r\nby small insects. Until the habits of the insect are more thoroughly\r\nunderstood, it will be difficult to advise any remedies.\r\n\r\nThere is quite a number of insects in this class that affect the grape\r\nvine, some of which may become troublesome, and we should watch their\r\nhabits. The following accounts are condensed from Dr. Fitch's Report:\r\n\r\n=Raphigaster sarpinus=, or the large Green Tree-bug, is grassy-green,\r\nedged with yellow, and a black point at every joint of the abdomen;\r\nfound in September.\r\n\r\n=Pentatoma ligata=, or the Bound Tree-bug, is also grassy-green, but\r\nmore widely bordered all round, except the head, with pale red, and\r\nhas a pale red spot on the middle of its back and on the apex of its\r\nscutel; antennæ green.\r\n\r\n=Arma modesta=, or the Modest Tree-bug, is tawny, yellowish-gray,\r\nthickly dotted with brown punctures; the wing-covers are red at the\r\napex of their leathery portion, and have a brown spot at the tip of\r\nthe hyaline portion; the under side is whitish, with a row of black\r\ndots along the middle, and another on each side.\r\n\r\n=Thelia univittata=, (_Harris_), or the Single-striped Treehopper, is\r\nchestnut-brown, shaped like a beech-nut, with a perpendicular\r\nprotuberance on the fore part of its back, higher than wide. It is\r\ntawny white in front, a white stripe along the back to the tip; length\r\n0.37 inch; July and August.\r\n\r\n=Ceresa bubalus=, or Buffalo Treehopper, is of a light grass-green,\r\nfreckled with whitish dots; with a sharp short point on each side,\r\nprojecting like horns.\r\n\r\n=Ceresa taurina=, is like the preceding, but the space between the\r\nhorns is concave.\r\n\r\n=Acutalis dorsalis=, is a small, triangular, shining Treehopper, with\r\na smooth round back; it is greenish-white, with a large black spot,\r\nfrom the anterior corners of which a line runs off to each eye.\r\nPlentiful about the last of July, a few remaining until October.\r\n\r\n=Erythroneura vitis=, (_Harris_), or the Vine-leaf hopper, is pale\r\nyellow, with two broad blood-red bands, and a third dusky one on the\r\napex. Swarms of these small insects occur in August, and often bleed\r\nthe foliage so as to injure it seriously.\r\n\r\n=Erythroneura tricincta=, or the Three-banded Leaf-hopper, is like the\r\npreceding species, but the bands are narrower.\r\n\r\n=Erythroneura vitifex=, or the Vine-destroying Leaf-hopper, is\r\nyellowish-white; the wing-covers have oblique confluent, blood-red\r\nbands, and a short, oblique, black line on the middle of their outer\r\nmargin. The thorax commonly has three red stripes, the middle one\r\nforked anteriorly and confluent, with two red stripes on the crown of\r\nthe head. When the wing-covers are closed, they look red, with a\r\ncream-colored spot, shaped like a heart placed anteriorly, and on the\r\nmiddle, a large diamond-shaped spot, with a small red spot in its\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nThese insects are sometimes seen in such numbers upon the grape vines\r\nin September, that, when the leaves are disturbed, they fly out and\r\nresemble a shower of snowflakes. The young resemble their parents,\r\nbut are destitute of wings.\r\n\r\nA REMEDY is much needed.\r\n\r\n=Erythroneura vulnerata=, (_Fitch_), or the Wounded Treehopper, is\r\ntawny yellowish, sometimes tinged with red; the wing-covers have white\r\nspots and veins, and on the middle of the outer margin an oblique\r\nblack streak, between two creamy white spots; the hind one smaller,\r\nand an oblique blood-red line at its end; tips smoky-blackish; length\r\n0.12 inch; September.\r\n\r\n=Otiocerus Coquebertii=, is a slim fly of yellowish-white color, with\r\na bright carmine-red stripe along each side of the body and wings,\r\nwhich are widely forked behind. Length 0.42 inch; July until autumn,\r\non the wild grape vine.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many insects of this order, which are familiar to\r\nmost country residents on account of their unpleasant smell. These are\r\nthe true bugs, and belong to the sub-division called _Heteropterous\r\nHemiptera_. The Squash-bug is a familiar illustration of these\r\ninsects; it is called the _Coreus tristis_, from its sad dull color;\r\nthey are quite destructive to all plants of the Squash family.\r\n\r\n=Reduvius trinotatus=, is one of this order, which is a valuable aid\r\nto the horticulturists, because its sucker is armed with sharp\r\ninstruments, that enable it to pierce and consume other insects, many\r\nof which are destroyed by it. This insect has been introduced into the\r\nWest for the sake of its valuable services.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER LEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\nThe insects of this order are very numerous, and in their larval or\r\ncaterpillar state they are often very destructive. In the perfect form\r\nof butterflies and moths, they commit little or no depredations,\r\nbecause their jaws have been transformed into a sucking apparatus.\r\nThey consume, in their perfect state, little else than honey.\r\n\r\nThe order has been divided into three great sections: Butterflies,\r\n_Papiliones_; Hawk-moths, _Sphinges_; and Moths, or _Nocturnes_. Of\r\nthese, the _Ægeridæ_ constitute a very distinct family, resembling\r\nbees and wasps rather than butterflies; their caterpillars also\r\ndiffer, being borers, and nearly naked. Butterflies are produced from\r\ncaterpillars that are not generally very injurious to our crops.\r\nHawk-moths are large insects, and have great power of flight; their\r\ncaterpillars are large and voracious. It is the moths proper, a very\r\nnumerous family, which do us the most harm, and which will demand the\r\nlargest share of our attention. They vary much in size and appearance.\r\nSome of the females are destitute of wings.\r\n\r\nThe _Arctians_ or Woolly Bears, are a very numerous division of the\r\ntribe of _Bombyces_ or Spinners, so called from the name of the\r\nSilk-worm; some of these will be mentioned.\r\n\r\n=Orgyia leucostigma=, or the Vaporer Moth, is a very beautiful\r\ncaterpillar, frequently seen upon our fruit trees, though not confined\r\nto them. They feed separately, and therefore we can best destroy them\r\nin the egg. Fortunately, these may easily be found during the winter,\r\nfor the female, being wingless, never quits her cocoon, but deposits\r\nthe eggs in a mass upon the outside of it. The whole contrivance is\r\none of the many illustrations of the wonderful instinct of insects.\r\nWhen about to spin, the worm secures two or more leaves, by entwining\r\nher silk about their stems, and also around the woody twig upon which\r\nthey grow; she then attaches them together by bands of silk, and spins\r\nher cocoon between them. She thus secures a winter resting place for\r\nher eggs, and her progeny, when they hatch the next summer, are upon\r\nthe tree that furnishes them their appropriate food. These dead leaves\r\nwill attract our attention during the winter, and should be gathered\r\nand burned. Many of the caterpillars are destroyed by a little\r\nIchneumon-fly.\r\n\r\n=Orgyia antiqua=, or the Rusty Vaporer Moth, of Europe, has been\r\nintroduced into this country, and has been quite destructive to\r\nthorn-hedges in Rhode Island. They may become troublesome to our\r\norchards.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these _Arctians_, or Tiger-moths, may be seen about our\r\nhouses on a summer evening, as they are chiefly nocturnal. One of the\r\nmost common is\r\n\r\n=Arctia phalerata=, or the Harnessed Moth, so called from the markings\r\non its wings. Another distinctly marked one is _Callimorpha\r\nmilitaris_, now called _C. Lecontei_. Beautiful illustrations of these\r\nare given in Dr. Harris' Report.\r\n\r\n=Spilosoma Virginica=, is the beautiful White Moth, or \"Miller,\" that\r\nwe see in May; it is the imago or perfect insect of a large hairy\r\ncaterpillar, of a yellowish color, frequently seen in our gardens, and\r\nquite destructive to vegetation.\r\n\r\n=Hyphantria textor=, or the Fall Web-worm, is very troublesome upon\r\nshrubs and trees during the summer and fall. They are called the\r\nWeb-worms from their habit of feeding gregariously in large numbers,\r\nand spinning a web that envelopes the leaves and the whole branch, as\r\nthey devour the foliage.\r\n\r\nThis insect commits sad ravages upon our cultivated trees of various\r\nkinds, for it is not a choice feeder, consuming but one species, like\r\nmany other insects. Their most common pasture is the mulberry, and the\r\nrelated Osage Orange is frequently attacked. The Elder bushes appear\r\nvery attractive to them, and are often covered with their unsightly\r\nwebs. Elms suffer very much; our favorite fruit trees are attacked;\r\napples, pears, cherries, quinces, and, occasionally, even the peach\r\ntrees are eaten by them. Even the repulsive Ailantus, which has often\r\nbeen recommended as a wormless tree, is greedily devoured by these\r\ncaterpillars, notwithstanding its disagreeable odor.\r\n\r\nThe eggs, from two to three hundred in number, are deposited on the\r\nunder side of a leaf, near the end of a twig. These soon hatch, and\r\nthe larvæ commence feeding on the upper surface, spinning their\r\nthreads from side to side, and then, attaching two or three leaves\r\ntogether, they soon make a web. They continue feeding and spinning\r\nalong the twig, as they consume the tender portion of the leaf,\r\nleaving the mere skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are small, of a pale yellow color, with a broad\r\nblackish stripe on the back, and another beneath. They are thickly\r\nclothed with whitish hair; the head and feet are black. Worms of the\r\nsame nest vary in size and colors. When about an inch long, they\r\ndisperse, and spin their cocoons. The moth is milk white, without any\r\nmarkings on its wings, and is 1.25 to 1.35 inch in width. (Vide\r\nHarris, p. 358).\r\n\r\nThough called the Fall Web-worm, these caterpillars appear about\r\nCincinnati in the end of May quite abundantly, and from that time\r\nuntil October, they are more or less frequent; most so in August. In\r\nthe North, they may be later; I have seen large tracts of forest\r\ndefoliated on the lake shore, in August, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.--For the destruction of these pests we must resort to\r\nhand-picking, when they are in the caterpillar state. The twig or\r\nbranch should be taken off, and the worms crushed or burned. It is\r\nfortunate for us that they are gregarious and that they spin a web,\r\nfor we can detect them while they are yet young, and when confined to\r\none or two leaves, so that the whole brood may be destroyed with very\r\nlittle effort. Birds, and some insects, aid us in keeping them in\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\n=Clisiocampa decipiens=, (_Walker_), or _C. Americana_, (_Harris_), is\r\ncommonly known as the Tent-caterpillar, or Nest-caterpillar. The larvæ\r\nare not indiscriminate feeders, but prefer the foliage of certain\r\nmembers of the _Rosaceous_ family of plants. Their natural food\r\nappears to be the common wild cherry, but they attack the apple so\r\nvigorously, that they are often called the apple tree worm. Mr. Fitch\r\nthinks they do not feed upon the peach; but I have frequently found\r\nthem upon this tree since 1855. The moth appears to be endowed with\r\nwonderful instinct in depositing her eggs; selecting a terminal shoot\r\nthat has completed its growth, they are placed to the number of 200 or\r\n300 around it in a broad ring or sheath, and covered with a sort of\r\nvarnish that protects them.\r\n\r\nVery early in the spring, when the buds of the apple have just begun\r\nto swell, the eggs hatch, and the little worms traverse the twig,\r\nspinning a slender thread; when they reach another branch, they halt\r\nin the bifurcation, and, moving about, soon create a slight web with\r\nthe silken threads, and from this they emerge in search of food,\r\nspinning a thread along their route, and when they return, they travel\r\nabout, and thus enlarge their web.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.--These insects may be attacked in the egg or in the larval\r\nstate. The former are so arranged as to be conspicuous on the naked\r\nspray at any time during the winter--whenever seen, they should be\r\nbroken or cut off, and carried to the fire. In the early spring, we\r\nmust watch for the little tents in the bifurcations of the limbs, and\r\nremove the nests with all the worms; this may be done when they are\r\nsmall, by using the thumb and finger; if larger, it is a disagreeable\r\ntask, but no orchardist should hesitate when he recollects that six\r\nhundred leaves is a day's ration for one colony. They can easily be\r\ngathered in their web, thrown upon the ground, and crushed with the\r\nfoot. Mr. Needham, of Massachusetts, has invented, what he calls, a\r\ncaterpillar scourge; it is a little cone of wood, clothed with a piece\r\nof wool-card. This is attached to a pole: when thrust into the web,\r\nthe whole nest is gathered by the card-teeth and brought down. An old\r\ndry mullein stalk has often been used for the same purpose, and some\r\nrecommend burning the nest, or shooting it; but I have more faith in\r\nthumb and finger work, believing it to be more thorough.\r\n\r\nAmong the natural enemies of these caterpillars are the Tiger-beetles,\r\nwhich a successful orchardist of Illinois uses systematically for\r\ntheir destruction. He catches a beetle, and puts it upon a tree\r\ncontaining a nest of the Tent-caterpillar, after which he finds the\r\nworms soon disappear.\r\n\r\n=Gastrophaca Americana=, (_Harris_).--The Lappet-caterpillars are\r\nfound on apple trees. The worms are flat, and when at rest on a limb,\r\nthey often escape observation from their gray color resembling the\r\nbark. A fringe of hairs, along their sides, gives them this flat\r\nappearance. They feed only at night. Dr. Harris found some in\r\nSeptember that measured two and one-half inches in length, and above\r\nhalf an inch in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURNIANS, CERATOCAMPIANS, ZEUZERIANS.\r\n\r\n=Platysamia (Attacus) cecropia=, (_Linn._), the Cecropia Emperor Moth,\r\nis found as a large cylindrical, pale green worm, three or four inches\r\nlong, and as thick as one's thumb, and having two rows of pale blue,\r\nprojecting points along each side, and two rows of pale yellow ones\r\nupon the back, with four larger, bright orange, or red ones\r\nanteriorly, all ending in little black prickles. The moth is large;\r\nits wings dark gray; each has a large white, crescent like spot in the\r\ncentre, margined with red, and a red band crossing both wings. Appears\r\nin June; width five to seven inches.\r\n\r\nThere are others of this family of noble moths whose names have been\r\nindicated above, but they are not very destructive to the orchard.\r\n\r\nThen come, in Dr. Harris' classification, the _Zeuzerians_, a group of\r\nmoths which, like _Ægerians_ among the Sphinges, pierce the roots and\r\nstems of trees. Among these is _Xyleutes (Cossus) robiniæ_, or the\r\nLocust-tree Boring-moth.\r\n\r\nThe Saturnians are a group of large, naked caterpillars, which are\r\ngenerally short, thick, clumsy, and cylindrical; they are leaf eaters,\r\nand some of them, when young, keep together in families, but separate\r\nas they become older, when they spin large silky cocoons sometimes\r\namong leaves, which they secure by silk to the twigs, sometimes\r\nattaching them to the stems and limbs, and at others at, or beneath,\r\nthe surface of the ground. This group contains some of the largest and\r\nmost beautiful moths, with large woolly bodies, and widely extended,\r\nhighly colored and ornamented wings. They lay a great many eggs; some\r\nfemales deposit several hundreds. Still they are seldom so numerous as\r\nto commit serious devastations.\r\n\r\n\"Among these are the _Telea Polyphemus_, _Tropæ aluna_, _Callosamia\r\nPromethea_, _Platysamia cecropia_, (formerly known under the genus\r\n_Attacus_, which is now restricted to the immense _A. Atlas_, and\r\nanother species of China), and the _Euchronia Maia_, and _Hyperchiria\r\nvaria_, (formerly known under the genus _Saturnia_, which is now\r\nretained for several European species). The latter species, (_H.\r\nvaria_), has been generally known among us under the name of _Saturnia\r\nIo_, but according to Dr. Packard, (who published 'a Synopsis of the\r\nBombycidæ of the United States,' in the Third Volume of the\r\nProceedings of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia), our species\r\nhas been confounded by authors with Cramer's species '_Io_,' from\r\nSouth America, and which belongs to a different genus.\"--[E.T.\r\nCresson, Mss.]\r\n\r\nThese moths may yet become valuable for the production of a kind of\r\nsilk, as they are enclosed in large cocoons, the fibres of which\r\nsurpass those of the Silk-worm in strength, and might be employed in\r\nthe formation of fabrics, similar to those manufactured in India from\r\nthe Tusseh and Arrindy Silk-worms, the strength and durability of\r\nwhich are proverbial. Mr. Pullein, who experimented with the cocoons\r\nof the _Cecropia_ found that twenty threads of this silk, twisted\r\ntogether, would sustain nearly an ounce more in weight than the same\r\nnumber of common silk.--(Vide Harris, pp. 295-303.)\r\n\r\n_Psychidæ_ are curious caterpillars, which, being naked, cover\r\nthemselves during the larva state with a case that protects their\r\nbodies, though open at both ends, and which they carry about with\r\nthem; these cases are made up of fragments of leaves, generally the\r\nstems and veins, which they connect together by threads of silk. The\r\nGermans call them Sack-bearers. Huebner called them _Canæphoræ_, or\r\nBasket-carriers, because the cases, often made of little sticks,\r\nresemble a basket. One genus is called _Oeceticus_, or House-insect;\r\nand the common species, which, in some parts of the country, commits\r\ngreat devastation upon the leaves of trees, is called the Drop-worm,\r\nor the Basket-worm, in many places.\r\n\r\nWe have several genera and species belonging to this sub-family, the\r\nmost common of which are the _Thyridopteryx ephemeraformis_, and\r\n_Oeceticus coniferarum_. The best means for the destruction of this\r\npest consist in persevering efforts for their individual destruction;\r\neach case should be cut or torn off in the winter, when they show\r\nvery plainly upon deciduous trees; they may be crushed, but had better\r\nbe committed to the flames.\r\n\r\nThe Notodontians are so called from a hump or horn, which rises from\r\nthe top of the fourth ring of the caterpillar; the tail is always\r\nraised when the insect is at rest. One of these is called, from its\r\nhorn, _Coelodasys (Notodonta) unicornis_. Some species consume the\r\nfoliage of our fruit trees, particularly the apple and quince; one of\r\nthese, the _Datana ministra_, (the _Eumetopona ministra_ of Fitch, or\r\nthe _Pygæra ministra_ of Harris), will be noticed below.\r\n\r\n=Eudryas grata=, and =E. unio.=--The Beautiful Wood-nymph, and the\r\nPearl Wood-nymph.--The worms are very much alike, and resemble the\r\nSpotted Forrester. The moths come forth in July; the fore-wings are\r\nmilk white, bordered behind and on the outer side, from the base to\r\nthe middle, with rusty brown, edged on the inner side with greenish\r\nolive; hind-wings nankeen yellow, with a blackish-brown border. These\r\nworms are best removed by hand-picking.\r\n\r\n=Datana ministra=, or the Hand-maid Moth.--The moths are troublesome\r\nvisitors to the evening student in June; they are brown, hairy,\r\nthick-bodied, and measure rather more than an inch across the wings.\r\nThis creature is destined to give us a great deal of trouble by her\r\nprogeny, for she deposits her numerous eggs on the under side of the\r\nleaf on a twig of quince, apple, and cherry trees, where they hatch\r\ninto worms, that, during their existence of about four weeks, consume\r\nimmense quantities of foliage, often stripping the trees bare.\r\n\r\nThe worms feed gregariously, lying side by side in solid phalanx. They\r\nare of a dark brown in their younger state, but become lighter and\r\nmore clearly marked at each successive moulting, so that they are\r\ndistinctly striped with black and yellow. The peculiar character of\r\nthis worm is, that when at rest, the head and tail are carried up in\r\nthe air, or recurved over the body, which is supported by the six prop\r\nlegs placed near the middle. When disturbed, these caterpillars often\r\nthrow their heads from side to side, as though in anger. They are\r\nsparingly furnished with hairs, and they spin but little; though when\r\nyoung, the worms will sometimes drop from the leaves when disturbed,\r\nand hang suspended by a fine strand of silk. At full size, these\r\ncreatures are an inch and three-quarters to two inches long, and as\r\nthick as a goose quill, so that we can readily imagine the amount of\r\ndestruction which may be committed by one of these armies or family\r\ngroups of one to two hundred worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Constant vigilance is required on the part of the\r\norchardist, and unremitting efforts while the insect is in the larval\r\ncondition. Fortunately for us, their habits are such as to aid us in a\r\nremarkable way. They may be looked for in July, but they become\r\nnumerous only about the end of August, and in September. Some late\r\nbroods may be seen on the access of early frosts, but by the end of\r\nSeptember, the worms generally perfect their growth, and descend into\r\nthe earth to undergo their changes for the next season, when the moths\r\nwill again appear.\r\n\r\nWhen we may be inspecting our orchards, in the summer and autumn, we\r\nshould observe any defective foliage, as this is often an indication\r\nof the inroads of insects. If our trees have been neglected, we may\r\nbe alarmed by observing some of the thriftiest shoots and branches\r\nquite stripped of their leaves; and, lying along the stems, or crowded\r\ntogether, we shall see these unpleasant worms, unless they be foraging\r\nupon an adjoining, or sometimes upon quite a distant branch; for, in\r\nchanging their pasture, they descend one twig and pass out upon\r\nanother, which may diverge considerably from the first.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of their existence, however, the little worms\r\nconsume only the upper surface of the leaves, and it is at this period\r\nthat we may most advantageously attack them. The leaves that have thus\r\nhad their substance eroded become dry and whitish, and attract our\r\nattention. They are generally found upon a single twig or spray,\r\nusually a lateral, and it should at once be examined, as we may now\r\neasily destroy the whole brood by rolling a single leaf between the\r\nthumb and finger.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOCTUÆ, OR OWLET-MOTHS, CUT-WORMS.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insects are thick-bodied, and of dull colors; they fly at\r\nnight. The caterpillars are naked, live in the soil, and feed above\r\nground at night, when they do considerable damage. The common\r\nCut-worm, _Agrotis_, is an illustration. There are several sorts,\r\nwhich have received different names, but the worms all have very\r\nsimilar habits.\r\n\r\nThe moths are supposed to lay their eggs in July, when they soon hatch\r\nand feed during the season; they attain considerable size and\r\nhybernate in the soil.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.--Fall and winter plowing has been recommended, as it\r\nexposes the worms to the birds, and to the weather, but especially\r\nbecause it destroys the vegetation upon which they might subsist in\r\nthe early spring. The only safe way, is to watch their traces among\r\nour plants, and dig down beside them, find the worm, and destroy it.\r\nThough this does not restore the plant already killed, we prevent\r\nfurther damage, and may hope to thus diminish the pest in future\r\nyears, which is no small matter. A knowledge of their nocturnal habits\r\nhas induced some gardeners to go among their young plants with a lamp\r\nor candle at night, when they may find the caterpillars feeding. A few\r\nchoice plants may be protected by wrapping their stems with a strip of\r\npaper, or a stout leaf, (hickory), at the time of transplanting into\r\ninfested grounds; this will save them. Tobacco water has been found\r\nvery effective, applied to the plants, which it does not injure.\r\n\r\n=Mamestra arctica=, (_Hadena amica_, of Harris, and _H. amputatrix_,\r\nof Fitch), is a Cut-worm of a brownish color, about one and a half\r\ninch long. It is sometimes quite destructive in the nursery and\r\ngarden, ascending woody plants, and cutting them off where succulent,\r\nin the month of May. It can only be checked by seeking for it, in the\r\nsoil, near the base of the plants affected.\r\n\r\nAll these Cut-worms are eaten by birds, among which the crow is a\r\nvaluable aid to the farmer, and should be cherished for his services\r\ninstead of being condemned as a bird of ill-omen. Predacious insects\r\nalso consume numbers of them; one of these is the larva of a beetle,\r\n_Harpalus calaginosus_. A large Ichneumon-fly has been found hunting\r\nafter the worms, and is considered their natural enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOMETERS, SPAN-WORMS, CANKER-WORMS.\r\n\r\nThe measuring worms take their name from their peculiar method of\r\nlocomotion; having their legs at each end of their long bodies, they\r\nwalk by progressive leaps, arching up their backs by bringing their\r\nhind-legs forward, and then thrusting their heads out to their full\r\nlength. Many of them drop from the trees, and hang suspended by a\r\nthread of silk, when disturbed, or when seeking the earth to undergo\r\ntheir transformations. Some of them are naked, or have few hairs; most\r\nare smooth, often striped, or of an uniform color, like the bark of\r\nthe trees on which they feed.\r\n\r\nThe moths are slender-bodied; the wings large; of some the females\r\nhave no wings. These are the _Hybernians_, including the Canker-worm,\r\n_Anisopterix vernata_. These caterpillars are very numerous and\r\ndestructive; they do not feed gregariously, and are difficult to\r\ncombat in that form. The pupæ are under ground, and, as the female\r\nmoths are wingless, and must ascend the trees to deposit their eggs,\r\nwe can destroy them in the perfect form by meeting them on the highway\r\nthey have to pass. Ingenious devices have been invented for this\r\npurpose; among the most effective of these are vessels of oil,\r\nfastened closely around the bole of the tree. The moths emerge from\r\nthe ground in early spring, but many come out during pleasant mild\r\ndays in the winter, and some even in the autumn; so the remedies must\r\nbe applied early to be of any use.\r\n\r\nHarris describes a smaller species as the _Anisopterix pometaria_.\r\n\r\n=Hybernia tiliaria=, or the Span-worm of the Linden, is abundant in\r\nJune, growing to the length of an inch and a half. A belt of tar,\r\napplied to the trees, has been found effective in preventing the\r\nascent of the wingless females; this needs renewing daily, until the\r\nseason of their rising has passed.\r\n\r\n=Ellopia ribearia=, or the Currant-moth, was figured and described by\r\nFitch as the _Abraxas? ribearia_, in New York Reports for 1856. The\r\nworm is light yellow, with black dots. It eats the leaves of currants\r\nand gooseberries, in June. The moth ascends from the ground in July;\r\nit is nankeen-yellow; quite a common insect in some parts of the\r\ncountry. It must have some natural enemies, for, where very abundant\r\none year, it sometimes disappears altogether the next. Hand-picking is\r\nthe only remedy known, and this is quite a tedious process.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORTRICES, DELTA MOTHS, OR LEAF-ROLLERS.\r\n\r\nThe Leaf-rollers are a numerous tribe, and some of them are\r\ntroublesome upon our cultivated trees and vines. They curl up the edge\r\nof the leaf upon which they feed, and fasten it with little bands of\r\nsilk, and thus shelter themselves from the weather and from their\r\nenemies. They are naked worms, and generally light colored, and\r\nexceedingly active. Some live in the unfolding leaves and flower-buds,\r\nfastening them together so they cannot expand, while they devour the\r\ntender tissues. Some enter the young fruit, which they cause to ripen\r\nand fall prematurely. The moths are generally small, often prettily\r\nmarked, and fly only in the evening.\r\n\r\n=Loxotænia rosaceana=, (_Harris_), is found soon after the buds of the\r\napple begin to expand. They curl up and fasten them together, and do\r\nconsiderable damage.\r\n\r\n=Penthina oculana=, (_Harris_), has similar habits, and preys upon the\r\napple; both must be killed by hand.\r\n\r\n=Brachytoenia melania=, or the Many-dotted Apple Leaf-worm, is\r\nmentioned by Fitch[40] as eating holes in the leaves, in June and\r\nSeptember. It is rather thick, light green, an inch and a quarter\r\nlong, with five white lines and numerous white dots; the worms spin\r\ntheir cocoons in a leaf. There are two crops.\r\n\r\n=Loxotænia cerasivorana=, (_Fitch_), or the Cherry Tortrix, is a deep\r\nyellow worm, with black head and feet. Found in July, fastening the\r\nleaves together and living in families, forming a large nest.[41]\r\n\r\n=Desmia maculalis=, or the Spotted-winged Sable, or Grape Leaf-folder,\r\nis a slender, active green worm, that feeds upon and disfigures the\r\nleaves of our grape vines, rolling them with great regularity, and\r\nfastening them with strong bands of beautiful white silk. The pupa is\r\nformed within the rolled leaf. These worms begin in June, but continue\r\nto fold the leaves during the season of growth.\r\n\r\nThey can be destroyed by hand-picking, but it requires quickness and\r\ndexterity, as the worm escapes from either end of the open pipe when\r\ndisturbed. The warblers are very fond of them, and destroy a great\r\nmany.\r\n\r\n=Carpocapsa pomonella=, or the Codling-moth, is one of these\r\nTortrices, which gives great trouble. It has been introduced from\r\nEurope, but is steadily increasing as our orchards grow older, until\r\nwe now have few perfect fruit. The moth appears early in the summer to\r\nlay the eggs of the first crop of worms. This insect is figured and\r\ndescribed by different authors, among whom Dr. Trimble, of New Jersey,\r\nhas paid it especial attention in his recent work.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are dropped singly upon the blossom end of the apple, that\r\naffords an entrance to the young worm, which passes to the core, about\r\nwhich it consumes the pulp and the seeds. The worm is whitish,\r\nbecoming flesh-colored. In warm weather it attains its growth in three\r\nor four weeks, and makes its exit by gnawing through the side of the\r\nfruit. It instinctively seeks the stem of the tree to secrete itself\r\nunder the scales of bark, and this affords us an opportunity to\r\ndestroy it in the pupa state, for it will creep under any shelter that\r\nmay be put in its way.\r\n\r\nThe REMEDIES will depend upon the habits of the insect. The moth,\r\nbeing nocturnal, may be destroyed by burning lamps or fires in the\r\norchard during June, when they are first at work; cheap coal-oil may\r\nbe used for the purpose. The pupæ can be entrapped in large numbers,\r\nby putting a piece of old rag in the crotch of the tree, beneath which\r\nthe worms will crawl to spin their cocoons, when they may easily be\r\ndestroyed. Dr. Trimble has used a trap, made by twisting a hay rope\r\nand fastening it about the trunk of the tree; under the rope immense\r\nnumbers will be found. This trap should be examined fortnightly, as\r\nthe moths hatch out during hot weather in a shorter time than later in\r\nthe season, when some remain over winter in the pupal state.\r\n\r\nAll wormy fruit should be gathered as soon as it falls from the\r\ntrees, and either be boiled, or at once fed to swine. Hogs and sheep,\r\nkept in the orchard, will generally consume the fruit as fast as they\r\nfall to the ground; and this is the simplest and cheapest method of\r\ndestroying the worms.\r\n\r\n=Chætochilus pometellus=, (_Harris_), is commonly called the\r\nPalmer-worm. It feeds upon the leaves of our orchard and forest trees\r\nin June. Sometimes it appears in immense numbers, and, coming after\r\nthe period for the production of new leaves, great damage is done to\r\nthe trees; old trees, and limbs of younger ones, are sometimes killed.\r\nThere have been two celebrated invasions of this insect in the Eastern\r\nStates, those of 1791 and of 1853.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPE VINE FEEDERS.\r\n\r\nGrape vines are subject to the attacks of many lepidopterous insects.\r\nDr. Harris gives the history of seven American larvæ, mostly of large\r\nmoths, which feed upon grape leaves.\r\n\r\n=Pterophorus periscelidactylus=, or the Gartered Grape vine Plume, is\r\na pale green worm, half an inch long, which hides itself in a hollow\r\nball of leaves, fastened together with silken threads. It is described\r\nat length by Dr. Fitch, in the New York Agricultural Transactions.\r\n\r\n=Ohis myron=, (_Chærocampa pampinatrix_, of _Harris_), called also the\r\nVine Dresser, is somewhat troublesome in the vineyards, as it eats the\r\nleaves, and cuts off the bunches of grapes when half grown. This worm\r\nis thick, cylindrical, tapering anteriorly, pale green, freckled with\r\npale yellow dots, and, when mature, a pale dusky olive; 2.25 inches\r\nlong. The pupa is found under leaves on the ground; the moth emerges\r\nin June.\r\n\r\n=Philampelus satellita=, and =P. Achemon=, the Satellite and Achemon\r\nSphinges, are large green worms that feed upon the vine. They bury\r\nthemselves in the ground when going into the pupa state, and remain\r\nuntil the next July. The worms are seen in August and September.\r\n\r\n=Procris Americana=, or the American Forrester, is found feeding upon\r\nthe grape leaves at mid-summer, (June 22). The worms feed gregariously\r\non the surface of a leaf, some twenty side by side, leaving only a\r\nskeleton behind them when small, and consuming the leaf when older.\r\nThey are small, 0.60 inch long; yellowish. The moth is blue-black,\r\nwith a bright orange neck.\r\n\r\n=Alypia 8-maculata=, or the Eight-spotted Forrester, is a light blue\r\nworm, 1.25 inches in length. They leave the vines in July, and spin a\r\nweb on the ground; the moth appears in May; it is black, with orange\r\nshanks; each of the fore-wings has two large, light yellow spots; the\r\nhind-wings have two white ones. Width 1, to 1.50 inch.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆGERIANS.\r\n\r\n=Ægeria exitiosa=, (_Say_), or _Trochilium exitiosum_, is well known\r\nin its larval state as the Peach tree Borer, and is often so\r\ndestructive as to kill the trees. The habits of the worm as a borer,\r\nand its situation at the base of the tree, are somewhat similar to\r\nthose of the apple tree borer; but while that is the footless grub of\r\na beetle, this is a true caterpillar, the larva of a butterfly or\r\nmoth, with feet. The females deposit their eggs from June to October,\r\nplacing them upon the bark at the surface of the ground, sometimes in\r\nthe forks of the large limbs. The larva enters, and works downward;\r\nfirst consuming the bark, but afterwards eroding the wood also. Gum\r\nexudes from the wound, mixed with their castings, and indicates their\r\npresence. When ready to enter the pupa form, the worms come to the\r\nsurface, excavate a hollow in the wood, and prepare a tough leathery\r\nfollicle or pod, three-fourths of an inch long, in which they repose\r\nas pupæ.\r\n\r\nThis, or an analagous insect, attacks the plum tree, and behaves in a\r\nsimilar manner. The double-flowering Almond of our shrubberies is also\r\nattacked by the borer.\r\n\r\nThe perfect insect looks more like a wasp than a butterfly, for the\r\nwings of all this group are partially clear of feathers, and\r\ntransparent. It varies in size from a half to three-quarters of an\r\ninch in length, and from eight-tenths to one and three-tenths of an\r\ninch across. The female varies more than the male, and her wings are\r\nlarger in proportion to the body, which is heavier. The male is of a\r\ndeep steel-blue color, with sulphur-yellow marks, and glossy luster.\r\nThe wings are transparent and glossy; the veins margined and fringed\r\nsteel-blue.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES will depend upon the habits of the insect, and must be\r\ndirected to the pupa and larva, though valuable preventives are\r\napplicable to the perfect insect. The worms may be sought out by\r\nscraping away the gum and cutting the dead bark until we find them,\r\noften along the main roots; the follicles with the pupæ should also be\r\nsought. This work can be done in the autumn and spring; if at the\r\nformer season, the removed earth should be left away from the stem,\r\nwhen coal tar may be applied to destroy any worms left in the tree and\r\nto act as a preventive against future attacks, but this substance\r\nshould be used with great caution. If applied, the earth should be\r\nthrown back to the tree. Boiling soap-suds has been used with good\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVES are sometimes better than cures, and in this case they\r\nhave been very successfully used. They all consist in means to keep\r\nthe moth from depositing her eggs in the part of the tree where,\r\nalone, the borers can be harmful. Some raise a little mound of earth\r\nabout the tree in the spring, and allow it to remain there all summer.\r\nThe first application of this principle consisted in placing a chimney\r\ncrock about the base of the young tree when planted; into this coal\r\nashes, cinders, or even gravel was placed, which protected the base of\r\nthe tree. In the autumn the crock was lifted, and the materials\r\nscattered. An open box, made of four bits of board, tacked together,\r\nanswered the same purpose. A cone of coarse brown paper, tied about\r\nthe tree with grocers' string, or pasted upon the tree itself, when\r\napplied, will answer a very good purpose in keeping off the fly.\r\n\r\nA small portion of sulphur thrown about the tree is said to have the\r\ndesired effect, but the statement has not been confirmed by trial. It\r\nhas been recommended to plant Tansy with every peach tree, but doubt\r\nattaches itself to this suggestion also.\r\n\r\nIn the _American Agriculturist_, for February, 1865, is a notice of a\r\npeach tree protector made of sheet-iron, like a stove-pipe; and in the\r\nApril number, Mr. Bouthorpe, of Massachusetts, says, he had used a\r\nsimilar apparatus made of zinc, eight inches long, and twice the size\r\nof the tree, which was of easy application; the contained space next\r\nthe tree was to be filled with loose dirt. They were found to be a\r\nperfect protection.\r\n\r\n=Ægeria tipuliformis=, (Linn.), or the Currant Borer, has been\r\nimported from Europe. The eggs are laid near a bud; when hatched, the\r\nworms penetrate the pith of young shoots, killing them.\r\n\r\n=Ægeria pyri= is mentioned by Dr. Harris[43] as having done a good\r\ndeal of damage to pear trees, by boring under the bark. The perfect\r\ninsect resembles that of the Currant Borer, and makes its appearance\r\nnear the end of summer, leaving its chrysalis skin projecting from the\r\nhole in the bark, whence it had escaped.\r\n\r\n=Ægeria polistæformis=, or Grape Vine Borer, is mentioned by Mr.\r\nGlover in the Patent Office Report for 1854, p. 80. He had received it\r\nfrom North Carolina, where it was very destructive to all vines,\r\nexcept the Scuppernong. This insect has become rather common in the\r\nvineyards about Cincinnati, and its depredations, in consequence of\r\nthe large size of the caterpillar, are very serious. The eggs are laid\r\nnear the roots of the vine, and the larvæ bore into the bark and wood\r\nduring the summer, consuming them so completely, that the vine sickens\r\nand dies, and often breaks off at the ground, or just below the\r\nsurface. When fully grown, they measure from an inch to an inch and\r\nthree-quarters in length, are thick and whitish, and they form a\r\npod-like chrysalis, similar to that of the Peach Tree Borer, but\r\nwithin or beside the injured roots.\r\n\r\nThe moths are of a dark brown color, tinged with tawny-orange, and\r\nbanded with bright yellow on the edge of the second ring of the body;\r\nthe fore-wings are dusky, and the hind ones transparent.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.--No effectual methods of prevention are known; but it is\r\nwell to inspect the vines, and when the presence of the insects is\r\nsuspected, examine the roots, to find and destroy the worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUROPTERA, HYMENOPTERA, AND DIPTERA.\r\n\r\nThese several orders will be introduced together for convenience, as\r\nthey may be disposed of in a briefer mention than some of their\r\npredecessors; because they do not contain so many species that are\r\nnoxious by preying upon our cultivated plants. Some are even of\r\nadvantage to us by their carnivorous propensities.\r\n\r\nAmong the =Neuroptera= are several which are aquatic in their larval\r\ncondition, but when winged, they devour many insects; among these are\r\nthe Dragon-flies, commonly called Devil's-needles by the children, who\r\ndread them, but they are harmless creatures. The Ant-lions were\r\nreferred to under the head of Aphids, in the consideration of the\r\norder _Hemiptera_, as most voracious destroyers of Plant-lice.\r\nReference was also made to the Lace-winged Flies, _Hemerobius_, which,\r\nin the larval state, consume immense numbers of the same pests. A few\r\nof these insects are injurious; among them are the White-ants,\r\nWood-lice, and the Wood-ticks, which are annoying, though they do not\r\naffect our crops.\r\n\r\nOf the =Hymenoptera= there are many which, in a perfect state, consume\r\nthe juices of our choice fruits, as well as the pollen and honey of\r\nflowers. Their services among these last, as aids in fertilizing the\r\ngerms, is often of great importance to the fruit-grower. But, while\r\nacknowledging our gratitude to many for this service, and to the\r\nindustrious bee for gathering abundant stores of the nectared sweets,\r\nwe have a serious charge to bring against the family for their\r\ndepredations. The wasps especially are often troublesome, particularly\r\nin the vineyard, and their stings are annoying. Some ants are quite\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of some species are destructive as wood borers and as\r\nleaf-eaters, and others cause an excrescence or warty growth upon the\r\ntwigs and leaves where the eggs have been deposited; these are called\r\n_Gall-flies_. The great benefits rendered by a very large class of\r\ninsects in this order, however, may compensate for all the evil done\r\nby the others. I refer to the tribe of _Ichneumon-flies_ of several\r\ngenera. Some of these are very small, and deposit their eggs within\r\nother insects, where they hatch and destroy them by feeding upon their\r\njuices.\r\n\r\nMany of the wasps are predaceous, and destroy numerous insects to feed\r\ntheir larvæ. Some of these exercise a wonderful instinct in preparing\r\nand securing this food for their young, which is stored up in safe\r\ncaskets with the egg, and are ready to serve as food to the young\r\nlarvæ.\r\n\r\nThe _Diptera_, or two-winged insects, form an extensive order,\r\ncontaining many species, and these are composed of very numerous\r\nindividuals. Flies and mosquitos are exceedingly annoying to man and\r\nanimals, and many species, in the larval state, consume vegetable\r\nmatters; but even here they are often of use in consuming decayed\r\nvegetation, and like many others of the order may be considered\r\nscavengers, consuming, as they do, immense quantities of filth and\r\ncarrion, that would otherwise continue to taint the air and produce\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nSome of the most destructive insects of this order are the\r\n_Gall-gnats_, among which are the Wheat-fly and the Hessian-fly, which\r\noften sadly interfere with the farmer's prospects.\r\n\r\nA few insects will now be noticed more in detail.\r\n\r\n=Selandria cerasi=, or _Blennocampa cerasi_, is the common Slug of the\r\ncherry and pear trees, and quite a troublesome hymenopterous insect.\r\nIn some parts of the United States these little creatures are so\r\nnumerous as to strip the substance from the foliage of pears and\r\ncherries.\r\n\r\nOur Slug resembles the _Selandria oethiops_ of Europe, but is declared\r\nto be different. The larvæ are at first white, but the slimy substance\r\nthat oozes from their bodies covers them with an olive coating. They\r\nhave twenty very short legs; when fully grown, the largest are about\r\nnineteen-twentieths of an inch long. The head is concealed under the\r\nfore part of the body, which is largest before, and tapers behind.\r\nThey attain their growth in twenty days, casting their skins five\r\ntimes, eating them until the last time, after which they remain free\r\nfrom viscidity, and are of a clear yellow color. They leave the tree\r\nand enter the ground to the depth of one or three inches, to form\r\ntheir chrysalids. In three days they come up as flies, in July and\r\nAugust, to lay eggs for a second brood, the pupæ of which remain in\r\nthe ground during the winter.\r\n\r\nAnother insect of this genus is very destructive to our rose bushes;\r\nit is called _Selandria rosæ_.\r\n\r\n=Selandria vitis=, is a species that appears upon our grape vines, and\r\nis quite troublesome in some vineyards in July. They feed in companies\r\nof a dozen or more.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.--Shaking them off the leaves has been recommended, but does\r\nnot promise to be effectual. When few, they should be sought for and\r\ncrushed, to prevent their increase. Though troublesome, this may be\r\neffectually done, and their ravages leave traces that will direct us\r\nto the leaves which contain them.\r\n\r\nWhen more numerous, the foliage may be syringed with common soapsuds,\r\nor with the whale oil soap, two pounds to fifteen gallons of water.\r\n\r\nAir-slaked lime has been dusted upon them with good effect; ashes, and\r\neven dry dust from the road, will destroy them, by adhering to the\r\nslimy surface. These applications are best made when the foliage is\r\nwet after a shower, or with the dew. The great difficulty consists in\r\ntheir habit of going under the leaves, and thus being protected.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkman, the noted rose fancier, has found a mixture of soap and\r\npetroleum of great service, as it kills the slugs without injuring the\r\nbuds and foliage. To a gallon of soft soap he adds two-thirds of a\r\npint of petroleum, mixes them thoroughly, and dissolves in half a\r\nbarrel of water; to be applied with a syringe.\r\n\r\n=Diptera.=--Dr. Fitch describes as a new species _Malobrus mali_. He\r\nfound them in a fruit that had been perforated by the Codling-moth.\r\nThe larvæ are transparent; the flies resemble the Hessian-fly, that\r\ndestroys the wheat plant.[44]\r\n\r\n=Cecidomyia grossulariæ=, or Gooseberry Midge, attacks the fruit,\r\ngiving it the appearance of ripening prematurely. Considerable fruit\r\nis lost in this way.[45]\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter, the author feels obliged to express his\r\nregrets that no more space could have been appropriated to this\r\nimportant subject. He could only indicate some of the most troublesome\r\ninsects of our orchards and vineyards, and he hopes that the reader\r\nwill be induced to pursue the investigation for himself. He knows, by\r\nexperience, that the study will bring its own reward in the\r\ninformation that is received, and which is absolutely necessary to\r\nenable us to combat these troublesome pests successfully.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] _Practical Entomologist_, 518 South 13th street, Philadelphia,\r\nfifty cents a year, in advance.\r\n\r\n[24] Vide _Prairie Farmer_, _American Agriculturist_, _Country\r\nGentleman_, etc.\r\n\r\n[25] See Practical Entomologist, Vol. II, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[26] See Practical Entomologist, Vol. II, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[27] Harris, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[28] Harris' Report, p. 310.\r\n\r\n[29] For further details of these insects, the reader is referred to\r\nFitch's Report, pp. 82 to 98.\r\n\r\n[30] Rept. cit., p. 100.\r\n\r\n[31] Rept. cit., p. 122.\r\n\r\n[32] Rept. cit., p. 125.\r\n\r\n[33] Rept. cit., p. 134.\r\n\r\n[34] Trans.

QUALITY, TERMS EXPRESSIVE OF.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the description of a fruit, it is very desirable for the writer to\r\ncatch the strong characters, so that he, who reads, may the more\r\nreadily identify the specimen he holds in his hand. Among these\r\nseveral characters there is considerable difference as to their\r\npermanence and value; some are evanescent, some variable, while others\r\nare found to be more reliable and constant. Let us consider some of\r\nthese in the systematic order by which they will be taken in the\r\ndescriptions that are to follow.\r\n\r\nIn describing a fruit, the firmness, weight, and external characters,\r\nfirst claim our attention, then the internal; these are taken up in\r\nthe following order: externally, its shape, size, surface, color, and\r\ndots are examined. In the apple and pear the basin is next observed\r\nand its characters noted, with any peculiarities connected with the\r\neye, by which term the triangular space is designated that is embraced\r\nby the calyx, as shown in an axial section of the fruit; at the same\r\ntime the length and breadth and shape of the calyx segments are noted.\r\nThe other end of the fruit is then explored as to the form and\r\nmarkings of the cavity, and the length, size, and peculiarities of the\r\nstem. Having thus disposed of the externals, we are now to investigate\r\nthe nature of the internal structure; to do this, a section is made\r\nvertically through the middle of the fruit from the eye to the stem,\r\nwhich exposes the flesh, the axis with its core and the seeds, and\r\nwhich enables us to investigate some very important characters, such\r\nas the length of the axis, its form and that of its carpels, and the\r\nmanner of their union, whether they form an open core or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe number, color, and shape of the seeds are noted. The color of the\r\nflesh, its texture and juiciness are examined; the latter qualities\r\nare always tested by the teeth, and then the palate gives us an\r\naccount of the degree of richness, acidity, or sweetness and flavor.\r\nThe investigator is now prepared to render judgment; having the\r\ntestimony of his organs of touch, sight, taste and smell, he can\r\npronounce his decision as to quality, and is prepared to specify the\r\nparticular uses to which the fruit is especially adapted; whether for\r\nthe table as a dessert, for the kitchen, as in baking and stewing, or\r\nfor drying, or whether it be valuable for cider-making. A good judge\r\nwill now be able to decide whether the fruit be especially adapted for\r\nthe market or for the amateur. The season of ripening should be noted\r\nin this place, with any remark as to qualities not already provided\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM is one of our most permanent characters; though subject to\r\nmodifications, the general shape of the specimens is always\r\ncharacteristic of the variety. Even a novice will soon learn the\r\npeculiar outline of a variety of fruit.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing the study of these varieties of form, it will be\r\nwell to explain some of the leading terms introduced. By referring to\r\nthe illustrations, it will be observed that the outlines are inscribed\r\nin circles to which they are compared; these are drawn with dotted\r\nlines, and they are bisected with cross lines representing the two\r\ndiameters referred to in the classification by form: the vertical or\r\naxial diameter, _AA_, passing through the axis of the fruit, and the\r\ntransverse diameter, _BB_, at right angles to the vertical.\r\n\r\nThe FORM may be _round_ or _globular_ when it is nearly spherical; the\r\ntwo diameters, the axial and transverse, being nearly equal; fig. 30.\r\n\r\n_Globose_ is another term of about the same meaning.\r\n\r\n_Conic_, or _conical_, indicates a decided contraction toward the\r\nblossom end, fig. 31; _Ob-conic_ implies that the cone is very short\r\nor flattened.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--ROUND.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--CONICAL.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--OBLONG OR TRUNCATE.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--OBLONG CONIC.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 34.--OVATE.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 35.--OBLATE.]\r\n\r\n_Oblong_ means that the axial diameter is the longer, or that it\r\nappears so, for an oblong apple may have equal diameters; fig. 32.\r\n\r\n_Oblong-conic_, that the outline also tapers rapidly toward the eye;\r\nfig. 33.\r\n\r\n_Oblong-ovate_, that it is fullest in the middle; and like\r\n\r\n_Ovate_, which means egg-shaped, that it tapers to both ends; fig. 34.\r\n\r\n_Oblate_, or flattened, when the axial diameter is decidedly the\r\nshorter; fig. 35.\r\n\r\n_Obtuse_ is applied to any of these figures that is not very decided.\r\n\r\n_Cylindrical_ and _truncate_ are dependent upon one another, thus a\r\nglobular, or still more remarkably, an oblong fruit, which is abruptly\r\ntruncated or flattened at the ends, appears cylindrical in its form.\r\n\r\n_Depressed_ is an unusually flattened oblate form.\r\n\r\n_Turbinate_ or top-shaped, and _pyriform_ or pear-shaped, are\r\nespecially applicable to pears, and seldom to apples.\r\n\r\nWhen these forms are described evenly about a vertical axis, as shown\r\nby a section of the fruit made transversely, or across the axis, the\r\nspecimen may be called _regular_ or _uniform_, fig. 36; if otherwise,\r\nit is _irregular_, fig. 37, _unequal_, fig. 38, _oblique_ or\r\n_lop-sided_, fig. 39, in which last cases the axis is inclined to one\r\nside. If the development at the surface is irregular, as in the\r\nDuchesse d'Angouleme and Bartlett pears, the fruit is termed _uneven_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 36.--REGULAR.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 37.--IRREGULAR.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--UNEQUAL.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 39.--LOP-SIDED.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 40.--COMPRESSED.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 41.--QUADRANGULAR.]\r\n\r\nWhen a transverse section of the fruit, made at right angles to the\r\naxis, gives the figure of a circle, the fruit is _regular_; if\r\notherwise, it may be _compressed_ or flattened at the sides, fig. 40;\r\n_angular_, _quadrangular_, fig. 41; sulcate or _furrowed_, fig. 42,\r\nwhen marked by sulcations; or _ribbed_, fig. 43, when the intervening\r\nridges are abrupt. _Heart-shaped_ is a form that applies more\r\nespecially to the cherry, than any other kind of fruit.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 42.--SULCATE.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 43.--RIBBED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE is a character of but second rate importance, since it is\r\ndependent upon the varying conditions of soil, climate, overbearing,\r\netc. It has its value, however, when it is considered as comparative\r\nor relative. The expressions employed in this work to indicate size,\r\nare: _very large_, _large_, _medium_, _small_, _very small_, making\r\nfive grades.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the SKIN and surface are generally very reliable,\r\nthough the smoothness of the skin as well as the coloring depend upon\r\nboth soil and climate. We find, however, that a striped apple which\r\nhas been shaded, though pale, will always betray itself by a splash or\r\nstripe, be it ever so small or rare, nor will any exposure so deepen\r\nand exaggerate its stripes as to make it a self-colored fruit; and no\r\ncircumstances will introduce a true stripe upon a self-colored\r\nvariety. Hence we may consider this kind of marking a reliable\r\ncharacter, and apply it as an element of our classification. We\r\nsometimes find _lines_ on self-colored fruits that are as distinctive\r\nas the stripes, but entirely distinct from them.\r\n\r\nThe skin itself may be either _thick_ or _thin_, _smooth_, _rough_, or\r\n_polished_, and it is sometimes _uneven_; it may be covered with a\r\n_bloom_, it may be _russeted_ in whole or in part, and this may be\r\nthickly or thinly spread over the surface, or only net-veined. A sort\r\nof russeting occurs about the stem only in some varieties, and is\r\nnever seen in others, making a pretty good character, but in the same\r\nvariety it is often much increased or diminished.\r\n\r\nThis character, russet on the skin, has been very puzzling to young\r\npomologists in the study of pears, owing to its liability to\r\nexaggeration in some varieties, under the influence of certain\r\nclimatic conditions that have even produced it in varieties in which\r\nit had not been previously suspected. Some pears are characterized by\r\nthis russeting of the skin, either generally spread over the surface\r\nor confined to a limited area at either end of the fruit, particularly\r\nabout the insertion of the stem; others have never shown any\r\ndisposition to put on this character, but, under certain circumstances\r\nsome varieties, which should have been smooth and fair, become thickly\r\nspread with this russeting, that seems even to thicken the skin and\r\nwhich deteriorates the qualities of the fruit. In some cases this\r\nappearance is local, occupying one end of the fruit, or making a band\r\naround the middle and contracting it like a cincture, as though its\r\npresence prevented the proper growth and development of the sarcocarp\r\nor fleshy mass of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe colors themselves being as various almost as the hues of the\r\nrainbow, will be designated by their appropriate or customary names;\r\nthe manner of their laying on will require the use of certain definite\r\nterms, which should be understood to comprehend the classification,\r\nwhich, in part, depends upon this circumstance. Thus a fruit is called\r\n_self-colored_ when it is not striped, though it may be _blushed_ or\r\n_bronzed_, and the coloring may be so broken, without stripes, as to\r\nbe _mixed_ or curdled, _blotched_, marbled, _mottled_, _clouded_,\r\n_spotted_, _stained_, _shaded_ or _dappled_; but some of these\r\ncharacters are often found associated with striping also, or they are\r\nobserved in those kinds of fruit that are always devoid of stripes.\r\nStriped fruits are often so deeply colored that the separate stripes\r\ndo not appear so distinctly, as when there are fewer of them on a\r\nlighter ground and they can scarcely be perceived. When the stripes\r\nare long and distinct, they are called _streaks_; when short and\r\nbroken abruptly at their ends, the surface is said to be _splashed_.\r\nCertain pears are striped by a paleness or faintness of color, these\r\nare called _panache_, and are considered sports of their namesake\r\nvarieties which they resemble in other respects. A few peaches are\r\ndistinctly striped; some plums and cherries obscurely so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother class of surface or skin characters consists in the DOTS and\r\nSPECKS, which appear to be very valuable distinctive markings, on\r\naccount of their uniformity in different varieties. These may be\r\n_large_ or _small_, _numerous_ or _scattered_, _darker_ or _lighter_\r\ncolored, _prominent_ or _indented_. In shape they are _round_ or\r\n_elongated_, and this last is a valuable character because quite rare.\r\nSometimes the dots are characterized by having a green base or areola\r\naround them, which is very noticeable, and in some varieties these\r\nmarks, which are perhaps the stomata of the skin, are surrounded by\r\ndistinct rings of a gray color, that resemble _ocellations_ or eyes.\r\nNo reliance can be placed upon the delicate coloring that is often to\r\nbe seen upon the surface of certain light colored fruits, making rose,\r\nred, or purplish tints about these dots, as they are accidental only\r\nand not distinctive markings.\r\n\r\nNo one should confound these pores, that are designated as the _dots_,\r\nwith the superficial and extraneous marks that appear to be the\r\naccidental growth of some fungus or lichen, and which are very\r\ncommonly found upon the surface of many fruits, often giving them a\r\nquite pretty appearance that would be seized upon by the fruit painter\r\nas a special beauty, unless when so abundant as to produce an\r\nunpleasant smutchiness or cloudiness, such as is often found in the\r\nproduct of apple orchards that are situated in low bottom lands, and\r\nwhich peculiarity is attributed to the influence of fogs.\r\n\r\nThe BASIN or APEX of a fruit consists of that portion most distant\r\nfrom the stem. In the apple and pear it is commonly called the blossom\r\nend, and is often more or less depressed; hence the term _basin_. In\r\nother fruits it is called the point or _apex_. Both are characterized\r\nby peculiarities of form that serve as distinctive marks in the\r\ndescription of fruits, and these are characters of considerable value\r\non account of their permanence. In respect to its form, the basin,\r\naccording to its depth, is called _deep_, fig. 44; _shallow_, fig. 45;\r\n_very shallow_, or _medium_. It is _abrupt_, fig. 44, when the edges\r\nare steep; it is _narrow_ and _pointed_, fig. 46, or _wide_; it is\r\n_regular_, or _wavy_, _wrinkled_, _plaited_, _folded_, _ribbed_ or\r\nangular, fig. 46--when these peculiarities exist.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 44.--DEEP AND ABRUPT.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 45.--SHALLOW.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 46.--NARROW AND FOLDED.]\r\n\r\nSome fruits are _russeted_ at this part of their surface only, but\r\nthis marking is a variable character and is found in greater or less\r\ndegree in different localities; thus the Rhode Island Greening, to\r\nwhich it belongs, is sometimes almost entirely divested of the\r\nrusseting, and in other localities the surface is thickly spread with\r\nit half way to the stem; the Westfield Seek-no-further, which is\r\nslightly marked with this character in the North, often becomes a\r\nrusset apple in more southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe basin of some fruits is very apt to crack into irregular fissures,\r\nand this appears to be peculiar to certain varieties, though it is not\r\nesteemed a very reliable mark; the term _cracked_ is used to express\r\nthis. In some fruits, however, we find a very peculiar cracking that\r\nforms a permanent character, upon which great dependence may be\r\nplaced: all the rim of the basin in these is marked with a slightly\r\ncracked appearance that does not rupture the skin, and which resembles\r\nthe incipient breaking of the surface of a piece of dry leather; it\r\nhas, therefore, received the name of _leather-crack_. This is\r\ncharacteristic of a few sorts, and hence a valuable mark.\r\n\r\nWithin the basin is the EYE, which furnishes characters of great\r\nvalue. This I consider to mean the meeting of the segments of the\r\ncalyx, and more particularly in the apple, the triangular space\r\nenclosed by these parts, in which the remains of the stamens and\r\npistils are found. Hence the Eye can only be displayed by making a\r\nvertical section of the fruit. There are but a limited number of\r\nexpressions used in its description; thus the eye is said to be\r\n_large_, _small_, _long_ or _short_, and it may be _open_ or _closed_.\r\nThe segments of the calyx may be _converging_ or _reflexed_,\r\n_persistent_ or _obsolete_, according to their condition in the ripe\r\nfruit, and these several characters are quite reliable; but the simple\r\nfact that the eye is _open_ or _closed_, may depend upon the\r\naccidental breaking away of the segments of the calyx, and is of\r\nlittle value as a sign.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 47.--DEEP, STEM LONG.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 48.--WIDE, STEM STOUT.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 49.--WAVY, STEM CLUBBED.]\r\n\r\nThe next character to be considered is the attachment of the stem,\r\nwhich, in some fruits, is so depressed as to constitute what is called\r\nthe CAVITY. In the apple this portion has many variations that are\r\nquite characteristic of certain varieties of fruit. In form the cavity\r\nmay be either _deep_, fig. 47, or _shallow_; _regular_ or _irregular_;\r\n_wide_, fig. 48; or _narrow_, and _acute_, _wavy_, fig. 49; and\r\n_uneven_, _folded_, and even _lipped_, fig. 50; as when a portion of\r\nthe flesh protrudes against the stem, as in Pryor's Red, Roman Stem,\r\nand other apples, and in some pears. This portion is sometimes defaced\r\nby _cracks_ that separate the skin; it is occasionally green, and this\r\nis a good and distinguishing character of a limited number of fruits,\r\nboth apples and pears. The cavity is also _brown_ or \"_russeted_\" in\r\nsome fruits, and, though this character is quite variable in its\r\ndepth, amount and extent, we may consider the _brown_ or _russeting\r\nabout the stem_ quite reliable in both pears and apples.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 50.--CAVITY LIPPED.]\r\n\r\nThe stem has its place of insertion in the region we have just been\r\nconsidering. It is the peduncle of botanists, and in some species it\r\nseparates from the fruit by a joint--in others it remains attached and\r\nseparates from the twig, when it is considered a part of the fruit\r\nitself, as in the apple and pear. The shape, average length,\r\nthickness, and other characters, and especially its mode of attachment\r\nto the carpos[46] in the pear, give us some important characters, but\r\nthese are always somewhat uncertain and variable; hence they are\r\nrather relative than positive traits. In apples, stems may be _long_,\r\nfig. 47, _short_, fig. 48, or _medium_, according to their projection\r\nbeyond or concealment within the cavity, being called _medium_ when\r\nthey simply reach the contour of the outline. They are _slender_, fig.\r\n47; _medium_ or _thick_, _fleshy_, _knobby_ or _clubbed_, fig. 49,\r\naccording to the amount of their substance and its arrangement. They\r\nare _curved_ or _straight_, and _direct_ and _axial_, or _inclined_,\r\naccording to their direction and relation to the axis of the fruit;\r\nand in pears, they often have a peculiarity of the insertion dependent\r\nupon their being more or less fleshy; in both plums and pears, this\r\nfullness is often arranged in rings surrounding the base of the stem.\r\n\r\nSome pomologists have taken great pains to measure the length of the\r\nstems, which they report in inches and lines. As above stated, this is\r\nan uncertain quantity, and therefore of little value, except when\r\ntaken in relation to other measurements by way of comparison; hence I\r\nhave preferred to use the above-mentioned terms only in their relation\r\nto the axial diameter in describing the apples, unless where their\r\nextension is unusual. The variable length of this organ in some\r\nvarieties is remarkable, and we often find the smallest fruits having\r\nthe longest stems.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to examine the interior portions of a fruit, if it be an\r\napple or pear, we make a vertical section through the axis from basin\r\nto cavity. This exposes the internal structure and enables us to judge\r\nof the color and other characters of the fleshy pericarp, the length\r\nof the axis, the size of the core and carpels, and the number and\r\nappearance of the seeds. These characters are possessed of value, and\r\nare quite reliable; in many fruits the seeds furnish distinctive\r\nindications, and this is particularly the case with the stone fruits,\r\nmany of which are readily identified by the form and markings of the\r\nstones or pits, the _endocarps_ of botany.\r\n\r\nIn the apple particularly, we first have our attention drawn to the\r\nAXIS, which is sometimes very _short_, so that in some decidedly\r\noblate specimens, with deep basin and cavity, there is scarcely room\r\nbetween them for the core, which is shortened to correspond with the\r\noblate character of the fruit. This is illustrated by many of the\r\noutlines given in Class I. It is well also to observe and note whether\r\nthe axis be inclined. The form of the _core_ is not very reliable, but\r\nit has characters that are permanent and peculiar to certain\r\nvarieties. Thus it is always _open_ in some, and always _closed_ in\r\nother sorts of the apple. In the pear it is _gritty_ in some\r\nvarieties, and surrounded with fine grained flesh in others. The core\r\nis _large_, _medium_, or _small_, and these distinctions are\r\npermanent. Its outline, embracing the group of carpels, may be\r\n_regular_ or _irregular_, _long_ or _short_, _cordate_, _wide_ or\r\n_compressed_; it may reach the eye or otherwise, and it frequently\r\nclasps that portion.\r\n\r\nThe SEEDS are _numerous_ or otherwise; they are _long_ or _short_,\r\n_acuminate_ or _rounded_, _flat_, _angular_, _imperfect_, or _plump_,\r\n_large_ or _small_; they may be _pale_, even _yellow_, or _brown_,\r\n_dark_, and nearly _black_; and these shades are distinctive, often\r\nenabling the pomologist to decide upon the variety when other\r\ncharacters are less marked. The peculiarities of the stones of\r\npeaches, plums and cherries, and of the seeds of the grape, had better\r\nbe described in immediate connection with those species of fruit.\r\n\r\nIn the FLESH of fruits we find characters that most pomologists, even\r\nthe amateurs, are generally pleased to have under practical\r\nconsideration. They are also very reliable, for if the fruits be in\r\ngood condition, they are always the same in any given variety. In its\r\nconsistency, this tissue is either _firm_ and _compact_, or _spongy_;\r\nit is _fine grained_, _granular_, _gritty_, _fibrous_, or _breaking_,\r\non the one hand, or _tender_, _buttery_ and _melting_, on the other;\r\nthe flesh is either _dry_ or _juicy_, and tinted with various shades\r\nof color. In some we find a satisfying _richness_, while others are\r\n_thin_ and poor. Some have a fine aroma, while others have an\r\nunpleasant flavor or are scentless.\r\n\r\nSo intimately associated are our organs of taste and smell, that it is\r\ndifficult to separate and distinguish the impressions we receive\r\nthrough these senses. For our present purpose it will be best to\r\nconsider all under this head, whether really belonging to one or the\r\nother sensation; and the lexicographers themselves admit the\r\ncommonalty of taste and smell in the word _flavor_. These qualities of\r\na fruit depend upon so many accidents of season, culture, and\r\nespecially of the condition of ripeness, that they are of\r\ncomparatively little value in descriptions, except in their broadest\r\nexpressions of acidity and its opposite, which indeed are sufficiently\r\npronounced to be used in the classification of fruits.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their FLAVOR, fruits may be said to be _vinous_,\r\n_sub-acid_, _acid_, and _very acid_, or _sugary_, _sweet_, _very\r\nsweet_, and _honey sweet_; they may be _flat_ and _insipid_, or\r\n_highly flavored_, _mild_, or _astringent_; and as to fragrance, in\r\nwhich they may remind us of many other agreeable odors, they may be\r\nsaid to be _perfumed_ and _aromatic_, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn deciding upon the quality of the fruit that has thus been subjected\r\nto this series of tests, and to this thorough examination, we shall\r\nfind that the decision will depend upon the individual tastes, the\r\nlikes and dislikes of those who are called upon to render judgment,\r\nand that, at best, the result must be arbitrary. The terms expressive\r\nof this division are _inferior_, _good_, _very good_, and _best_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] From <karpos>, Greek, for fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n  NECESSITY FOR.

CONSPECTUS OF CLASSIFICATION USED IN THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe need of some classification grows more and more pressing, as our\r\nfruit lists have become more extended, and they now reach many\r\nhundreds. A good and reliable systematic classification has become\r\nabsolutely necessary, and has received a great deal of consideration.\r\n\r\nUpon what principle shall this classification be founded? The common\r\nalphabetical arrangement of most text books may be very convenient for\r\na mere dictionary of fruits, but is utterly useless to the novice who\r\ndoes not know the name of his specimen. The arrangement by season and\r\nsize has its difficulties in the uncertainty and variation of these\r\ncharacters in the different soils and climates of our extended\r\ncountry, and a sub-division and grouping of fruits by their quality of\r\nexcellence is not only unreliable, but is altogether arbitrary, and\r\nsubject to the greatest diversity of opinion arising from the various\r\ntastes of different individuals. We must look to some marked and\r\nreliable characters that are always present, easily recognized, and\r\npermanent or fixed. Among these shape or figure stands pre-eminent,\r\nnotwithstanding the acknowledged fact that some varieties are almost\r\nprotean. The shape of the general outline appears to be the best\r\ncharacter for the broad divisions of a classification. A sub-division\r\nmay again be made, which is to be based upon the regularity or\r\nirregularity of the shape.\r\n\r\nThe next character, and one of considerable value, is that dependent\r\nupon _flavor_ in its broadest characters of sweet and sour, which,\r\nthough sometimes giving rise to a puzzling question, is, in most\r\nvarieties, sufficiently marked to constitute the basis of a minor\r\nsub-division. _Color_, which is notoriously the poorest character and\r\nleast esteemed by botanists in their descriptions, on account of its\r\nliability to variation, is, however, of sufficient importance in\r\npomology to take a high rank and to appear very prominently in fruit\r\nnomenclature. Still it should be reserved for the lowest sub-divisions\r\nof a classification.\r\n\r\nAmong our American writers, who deservedly stand prominent as\r\npomologists, the most satisfactory attempt at classification is found\r\nin the little work prepared by J.J. Thomas. No one who has realized\r\nthe advantages to be derived from the simple and clear sub-divisions\r\nmade by this author, will ever be satisfied with a fruit-book that is\r\nnot arranged upon the basis of some classification. Thomas, in his\r\nexcellent work, makes three great divisions of apples according to\r\ntheir period of ripening, as the _Summer_, _Autumn_, and _Winter_\r\nfruits, to which some of us would desire to add _Spring_, or\r\nlong-keepers. Each of these he has divided into two classes--those\r\ncharacterized by their flavor as _sweet_ apples, and those possessed\r\nof more or less acidity; and each of these classes is subdivided into\r\ntwo sections, according to their color, as striped with red and not\r\nstriped; so that in this arrangement we have eighteen groups, and,\r\nwith specimen in hand, this synopsis enables us at once to decide in\r\nwhich of these groups of moderate dimensions we may look for the\r\ndescription we desire; and, if it be contained in the book, it may\r\nreadily be found. The labor of searching through the whole list is\r\nthus obviated.\r\n\r\nThe Germans have made many attempts at the classification of fruits.\r\nChrist, Diel, Dochnahl, Manger and Sickler, have been engaged in this\r\nwork; and Diel's Synopsis, though far from perfect, has been generally\r\nadopted. He makes seven classes, with orders under each. Dochnahl, a\r\nlater writer, has modified this by making two sections according to\r\nthe shape, whether _angular_ or _spherical_, and four classes also\r\nbased upon their form.\r\n\r\nRobert Hogg, in his _British Pomology_, which is an excellent account\r\nof the apples cultivated in England, has given a modification which\r\nanswers a good purpose for classification. He makes three great\r\nsections, according to season, _Summer_, _Autumn_, and _Winter_. Each\r\nof these is divided into two classes, according to shape: 1st,\r\n_Round_, _roundish_, or _oblate_; and 2nd, _Oblong_, _conical_,\r\n_oval_, or _ovate_. These again are grouped according to their colors:\r\nA, _pale_; B, _striped_; C, _red_; and D, _russet_.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of interest I will give Diel's classification.\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--RIBBED APPLES.\r\n\r\n1. They are furnished with very prominent, but regular ribs around the\r\neye, extending also over the fruit, but which do not render it\r\nirregular.\r\n\r\n2. Having wide, open, and very irregular cells.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--TRUE CALVILLES.+\r\n\r\n1. They taper from about the middle of the fruit toward the eye.\r\n\r\n2. They are covered with bloom when on the tree.\r\n\r\n3. They have, or acquire, by keeping, an unctuous skin.\r\n\r\n4. They are not distinctly and purely striped.\r\n\r\n5. They have light, spongy, delicate flesh.\r\n\r\n6. They have a strawberry or raspberry flavor.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--SCHLOTTER ÆPFEL.+\r\n\r\n1. The skin does not feel unctuous.\r\n\r\n2. They are not covered with bloom.\r\n\r\n3. They are either of a flat, conical, cylindrical, or tapering form.\r\n\r\n4. They have not a balsamic, but mostly a sweetish or sourish flavor.\r\n\r\n5. They have a granulous, loose, and coarse-grained flesh.\r\n\r\n+ORDER III.--GUELDERLINGE.+\r\n\r\n1. They are not balsamic, like Order I., but of an aromatic flavor.\r\n\r\n2. They have a fine flesh, almost like that of the Reinettes.\r\n\r\n3. They are either of a conical or flat shape.\r\n\r\n4. They are most prominently ribbed around the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II--ROSENÆPFEL--ROSE APPLES.\r\n\r\n1. They are covered with blue bloom when on the tree.\r\n\r\n2. They have not unproportionally large, but often only regular\r\ncells.\r\n\r\n3. They emit a pleasant odor when briskly rubbed.\r\n\r\n4. The skin does not feel unctuous.\r\n\r\n5. They are handsomely and regularly ribbed around the eye, and often\r\nalso over the fruit.\r\n\r\n6. They have a tender, loose, spongy, and mostly fine grained flesh.\r\n\r\n7. They have a fine rose, fennel, or anise flavor.\r\n\r\n8. They are mostly of short duration, and are often only summer or\r\nautumn apples.\r\n\r\n9. They are mostly striped like a turnip.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--FRUIT TAPERING OR OBLONG.+\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--FRUIT ROUND OR FLAT.+\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--RAMBOURS.\r\n\r\n1. They are all large apples, and comprise the largest sorts.\r\n\r\n2. They have mostly, or almost always, two unequal halves--namely, one\r\nside lower than the other.\r\n\r\n3. They are constantly furnished with ribs around the eye which are\r\nbroad, rising irregularly, one above the other, and extending over the\r\nfruit so as to render it irregular in its shape; they are also\r\ncompressed, and have one side higher than the other.\r\n\r\n4. They are constantly broader than high, and only sometimes\r\nelongated.\r\n\r\n5. They have all a loose, coarse grained and often very pleasant\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--WITH WIDE CELLS.+\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--WITH NARROW CELLS.+\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS IV.--REINETTES.\r\n\r\n1. They have a fine grained, delicate, crisp, firm flesh.\r\n\r\n2. They are mostly the ideal of a handsomely shaped apple; in them the\r\nconvexity or bulge of the middle of the apple towards the eye is the\r\nsame as that towards the stalk, or not much different.\r\n\r\n3. They are all gray dotted, or have russety patches, or completely\r\ncovered with russet.\r\n\r\n4. They have rarely an unctuous skin.\r\n\r\n5. They have all the rich, aromatic, sugary, and brisk flavor, which\r\nis called the Reinette flavor.\r\n\r\n6. They decay very readily, and must, of all apples, hang longest on\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\n7. The really sweet and at the same time aromatic apples belong to the\r\nReinettes, only as regards their shape, their character, and their\r\nfine and firm flesh.\r\n\r\n8. Apples with fine, firm, crisp flesh, which cannot of themselves\r\nform a distinct class; for instance, the Pippins belong to this class.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--SELF-COLORED REINETTES.+\r\n\r\n1. Having a uniform green ground color, which changes to the most\r\nbeautiful golden yellow.\r\n\r\n2. Having no lively colors or marks of russet on the side next the\r\nsun, except those that are very much exposed, and which assume a\r\nslight tinge of red.\r\n\r\n3. Having no covering of russet, but only slight traces of russety\r\nstripes.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--RED REINETTES.+\r\n\r\nHaving all the properties of the self-colored Reinettes, but of a pure\r\nred on the side next the sun, without any mixture of russet.\r\n\r\n+ORDER III.--GRAY REINETTES.+\r\n\r\n1. The ground color is green, changing to dingy dull yellow.\r\n\r\n2. The coating of russet, or the russety patches, spread over the\r\ngreater part of the fruit, are very conspicuous.\r\n\r\n3. The side next the sun is often dull brownish or ochreous red.\r\n\r\n+ORDER IV.--GOLDEN REINETTES.+\r\n\r\n1. On the side next the sun they are washed or striped with beautiful\r\ncrimson.\r\n\r\n2. The ground color changes by keeping to a beautiful deep yellow.\r\n\r\n3. Over the ground color, and the crimson of the exposed side, are\r\nspread light thin patches, or a complete coat of russet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS V.--STREIFLINGE--STRIPED APPLES.\r\n\r\n1. They are all, and almost always, marked with broken stripes of red.\r\n\r\n2. These stripes are found either over the whole fruit, or only very\r\nindistinctly on the side exposed to the sun.\r\n\r\n3. The stripes may be distinct--that is to say, truly striped; or\r\nbetween these stripes on the side next the sun the fruit is dotted,\r\nshaded, or washed with red; but on the shaded side the stripes are\r\nwell defined.\r\n\r\n4. The cells are regular.\r\n\r\n5. They are of a purely sweet, vinous, or acid flavor.\r\n\r\n6. They have not the same flavor as the Rose apples.\r\n\r\n7. They do not decay, except when gathered before maturity.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--FLAT STREIFLINGE.+\r\n\r\n1. They have the bulge at the same distance from the eye as from the\r\nstalk, and are broadly flattened.\r\n\r\n2. They are constantly half an inch broader than high.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--TAPERING STREIFLINGE.+\r\n\r\n1. They are broader than high.\r\n\r\n2. They diminish from the middle of the apple towards the eye, so that\r\nthe superior half is conical or pyramidal, and not at all similar to\r\nthe inferior half.\r\n\r\n+ORDER III.--OBLONG OR CYLINDRICAL STREIFLINGE.+\r\n\r\n1. The hight and breadth are almost equal.\r\n\r\n2. They diminish gradually from the base to the apex.\r\n\r\n3. Or from the middle of the fruit they gradually diminish toward the\r\nbase and apex equally.\r\n\r\n+ORDER IV.--ROUND STREIFLINGE.+\r\n\r\n1. The convexity of the fruit next the base and the apex is the same.\r\n\r\n2. The breadth does not differ from the hight, except only about a\r\nquarter of an inch.\r\n\r\n3. Laid in the hand, with the eye and stalk sidewise, they have the\r\nappearance of a roundish grape.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS VI.--TAPERING APPLES.\r\n\r\n1. They have the cells regular.\r\n\r\n2. They are not covered with bloom.\r\n\r\n3. They are not striped, and are either of a uniform color, or washed\r\nwith red on the side next the sun.\r\n\r\n4. Constantly diminishing to a point towards the eye.\r\n\r\n5. They are sweet or vinous, approaching a pure acid.\r\n\r\n6. They do not readily decay.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--OBLONG, CYLINDRICAL OR CONICAL.+\r\n\r\nCharacters the same as Order III. of the Streiflinge.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--TAPERING TO A POINT.+\r\n\r\nCharacters the same as Order II. of the Streiflinge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS VII.--FLAT APPLES.\r\n\r\n1. They are constantly broader than high.\r\n\r\n2. They are never striped.\r\n\r\n3. They are either of a uniform color, or, on the side exposed to the\r\nsun, more or less washed or shaded with red.\r\n\r\n4. They have regular cells.\r\n\r\n5. They are not unctuous when handled.\r\n\r\n6. They do not readily decay.\r\n\r\n7. Flavor purely sweet, or purely sour.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--PURELY FLAT APPLES.+\r\n\r\n1. The difference is obvious to the eye.\r\n\r\n2. The breadth is constantly half an inch more than the hight.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--ROUND-SHAPED FLAT APPLES.+\r\n\r\n1. The eye cannot easily detect a distinction between the breadth and\r\nhight.\r\n\r\n2. The breadth rarely exceeds the hight by a quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\n3. The fruit, cut transversely, exhibits almost or quite two equal\r\nhalves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCHNAHL'S CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SECTION I.--PLEUROIDEA.=--ANGULAR OR RIBBED.\r\n\r\nHaving sharp or flat ribs, which extend over the length of the fruit\r\nand are most prominent around the eye, where they are most generally\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--MALA CYDONARIA--QUINCE-SHAPED.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--CALVILLES.+\r\n\r\n1. They have large heart-shaped cells, open towards the axis, or often\r\nentirely torn; the cells extend very often from the stalk even to the\r\ntube of the calyx.\r\n\r\n2. They diminish from about the middle of the fruit, or a little above\r\nit, towards the eye.\r\n\r\n3. They are regular, and provided generally with fine ribs, which do\r\nnot disfigure the fruit.\r\n\r\n4. On the tree, the fruit is covered with bloom.\r\n\r\n5. They are never distinctly striped.\r\n\r\n6. Their flesh is soft, loose, fine and light, of a balsamic flavor,\r\nsimilar to that of strawberries or raspberries.\r\n\r\n7. The eye is frequently closed.\r\n\r\n8. Many of them acquire by keeping an oily or unctuous skin.\r\n\r\nGROUP I.--Fruit red, almost entirely covered with red.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.--Fruit parti-colored; yellow; very much striped or washed\r\nwith red.\r\n\r\nGROUP III.--Fruit yellow; of a whitish, greenish, or golden yellow.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--PSEUDO-CALVILLES.+\r\n\r\n1. The cells are almost the same as the true Calvilles--very large and\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n2. The calycinal tube is wide and generally very short.\r\n\r\n3. They are slightly narrowed toward the eye, and flattened toward the\r\nstalk.\r\n\r\n4. Their ribs are very prominent, especially around the eye.\r\n\r\n5. They are aromatic, and have not the balsamic flavor of the true\r\nCalvilles.\r\n\r\n6. Their flesh is fine, opaque, a little succulent, and almost equal\r\nto the Reinettes.\r\n\r\nGROUPS I., II., III., as above.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--MALA PYRARIA--PEAR-SHAPED.\r\n\r\nTheir flavor is neither balsamic nor aromatic; they are purely sweet\r\nor acid; their flesh is granulous and loose.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--TREMARIA--SEEDS LOOSE.+\r\n\r\n1. They are almost always large apples, the skin of which is neither\r\nunctuous nor covered with bloom.\r\n\r\n2. They are also furnished with ribs; but they are not so regular as\r\nin the Calvilles.\r\n\r\n3. The cells are very large, irregular, widened, and generally open.\r\n\r\n4. The calycinal tube is most generally widely conical, and does not\r\nextend to the cells.\r\n\r\n5. They are of a flattened, conical, cylindrical or pointed shape.\r\n\r\n6. Their flesh is loose, more often a little coarse, and of a slightly\r\nbalsamic flavor.\r\n\r\n7. The leaves of these trees are very large, rather deeply dentated,\r\nand less downy than those of the Calvilles.\r\n\r\nGROUP I.--_Unicolores_--Green, greenish, yellow, or golden yellow, and\r\nslightly tinged with red.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.--_Bicolores_--Yellow or green, and distinctly striped or\r\nwashed with red.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--RAMBURES.+\r\n\r\n1. They are all very large.\r\n\r\n2. They have almost always the two halves unequal.\r\n\r\n3. They are constantly broader than high, and appear sometimes higher\r\nthan they are.\r\n\r\n4. They are not furnished with ribs, except around the eye; these are\r\noften irregular in numbers, and frequently form broad projections on\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\n5. They do not decay, but shrivel when they have passed maturity.\r\n\r\n6. The flesh is coarsely granulous, rarely aromatic, nevertheless\r\noften very agreeable.\r\n\r\nGROUP I.--_Capsulis amplis_--Wide cells.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.--_Capsulis angustis_--Narrow cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--SPHÆROIDÆ--SPHERICAL.\r\n\r\nThey have sometimes prominences on the fruit and around the eye, but\r\nnever true ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--MALA MESPILARIA--MEDLAR SHAPED.\r\n\r\nTheir flavor is sweet, aromatic, similar to that of the Rose, fennel\r\nor anise.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--APIANA, OR ROSE APPLES.+\r\n\r\nTheir flesh is soft, loose, marrowy, very fine grain, and of a snow\r\nwhite color.\r\n\r\n2. The cells are almost always regular and closed.\r\n\r\n3. They are regularly ribbed around the eye, and often also over the\r\nfruit, but sometimes not at all ribbed.\r\n\r\n4. They have a balsamic flavor, accompanied with a very agreeable\r\nodor.\r\n\r\n5. They emit a pleasant odor when briskly rubbed.\r\n\r\n6. When on the tree they are frequently covered with a blue bloom, and\r\nstriped like a Tulip.\r\n\r\n7. The fruit is mostly small, or middle sized.\r\n\r\n8. They are mostly of short duration, and lose their good flavor the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nGROUP I.--_Oblongi_--Oblong fruit.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.--_Sphærici_--Round or flattened.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--REINETTA--REINETTES.+\r\n\r\n1. These are apples which generally have the most regular and handsome\r\nshape, having the bulge in the middle, at the same distance from the\r\neye as from the stalk.\r\n\r\n2. All are dotted, clouded, or entirely covered with russet.\r\n\r\n3. They are very rarely inclined to be unctuous, but generally rough\r\nwhen handled.\r\n\r\n4. They all decay very readily; (they must therefore be left as long\r\nas possible on the tree.)\r\n\r\n5. Their flesh is fine grained, crisp, firm, or fine and delicate.\r\n\r\n6. They are all charged with only a balsamic, sugary acid, which is\r\ncalled Reinette-flavored.\r\n\r\nGROUP I.--_Unicolores._--1. Having uniform green ground color, which\r\nchanges to the most beautiful golden yellow.\r\n\r\n2. Having no lively colors or marks of russet on the side next the\r\nsun, except those that are very much exposed, and are slightly tinged\r\nwith red.\r\n\r\n3. Having no covering of russet, but only slight traces of russety\r\nstripes.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.--_Rubri_--Fruit red; having all the properties of the\r\nself-colored Reinettes; but on the side next the sun they are of a red\r\ncolor, with a mixture of russet.\r\n\r\nGROUP III.--_Ravi_--Russeted.\r\n\r\n1. Their ground color is green, changing to dingy, dull yellow.\r\n\r\n2. The coatings of russet are very conspicuous.\r\n\r\n3. The side next the sun is often dingy, brownish, or ochreous red.\r\n\r\n4. They all decay very readily.\r\n\r\nGROUP IV.--_Aurei_--Yellow or golden fruit, Golden Reinettes.\r\n\r\n1. On the side next the sun they are washed or striped with beautiful\r\ncrimson.\r\n\r\n2. The ground color changes, by keeping, to beautiful deep yellow.\r\n\r\n3. Over the crimson there is a light thin trace, or a complete\r\ncovering of russet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS IV.--MALA MALARIA--PERFECT OR PURE APPLE-SHAPED.\r\n\r\nThey are of a perfectly sweet or vinous flavor, approaching to pure\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--STRIOLA, OR STRIPED.+\r\n\r\n1. They are almost always marked with broken stripes of red.\r\n\r\n2. These are either over the whole fruit, or only indistinctly on the\r\nside exposed to the sun.\r\n\r\n3. The stripes may all be distinct--that is, clearly and finely\r\nstriped; or between these stripes, on the side next the sun, the fruit\r\nis dotted, shaded or washed with red; but on the shaded side the\r\nstripes are well defined.\r\n\r\n4. The cells are regular.\r\n\r\n5. The fruit does not decay, except when gathered before maturity, or\r\nafter the period when it has been properly ripened.\r\n\r\nGROUP I.--_Depressa_--Flat.\r\n\r\n1. They have the bulge at the same distance from the eye as from the\r\nstalk, and are broadly flattened.\r\n\r\n2. They are always half an inch broader than high.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.--_Acuminati_--Pointed.\r\n\r\n1. They are broader than high.\r\n\r\n2. They diminish from the middle of the apple toward the eye, so that\r\nthe superior half is conical, and is not at all similar to the\r\ninferior half.\r\n\r\nGROUP III.--_Oblongi_--Oblong or cylindrical.\r\n\r\n1. The hight and breadth are almost equal.\r\n\r\n2. They diminish gradually from the base to the apex.\r\n\r\n3. Or, from the middle of the fruit they gradually diminish toward the\r\nbase and apex equally.\r\n\r\nGROUP IV.--_Sphærici_--Round.\r\n\r\n1. The convexity of the fruit next the base and the apex is the same.\r\n\r\n2. The breadth does not differ from the hight, except only about a\r\nquarter of an inch.\r\n\r\n3. When laid on their side they present a spherical shape.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--CONTUBERNALIA--STORING APPLES.+\r\n\r\n1. Having the cells regular.\r\n\r\n2. They are not striped, and are either of a uniform color or washed\r\nwith red on the side next the sun.\r\n\r\n3. They do not readily decay.\r\n\r\n4. They are not unctuous when handled.\r\n\r\n5. They are never covered with bloom.\r\n\r\nGROUP I.--_Acuminati_--Tapering, diminishing toward the eye.\r\n\r\nGROUP II.--_Depressi_--Flat. These are constantly broader than\r\nhigh.[47]\r\n\r\nAfter a long and careful consideration and study of this subject, I\r\nhave prepared the following formula for the CLASSIFICATION OF APPLES.\r\nIt consists of four classes that are based upon the general figure of\r\nthe fruit; with two orders, that are distinguished by a modification\r\nof the form, causing the fruit to be regular, or irregular, and\r\nangular. The characters upon which the classes are founded are\r\nexemplified by a vertical section through the length of the axis of\r\nthe fruit. Those by which the Orders are distinguished are shown by a\r\ntransverse section, made at right angles to the axis, or by holding\r\nthe fruit with the blossom end toward the eye.[48]\r\n\r\nEach of these Orders may contain two _Sections_, characterized by\r\ntheir flavor as sweet and sour; and each of these may again be\r\nsub-divided into three _Sub-sections_, that are based upon color.\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--OBLATE OR FLAT, having the axis shorter than the transverse\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nORDER I.--REGULAR.\r\n\r\nORDER II.--IRREGULAR.\r\n\r\nSECTION 1.--Sweet.\r\n\r\nSECTION 2.--Sour.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTION 1.--Pale or blushed, more or less, but self-colored and\r\nnot striped.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTION 2.--Striped or Splashed.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTION 3.--Russeted.\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--CONICAL, tapering decidedly toward the eye, and becoming\r\nOVATE when larger in the middle and tapering to each end, the axial\r\ndiameter being the shorter.\r\n\r\nORDERS I and II.\r\n\r\nSECTIONS 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTIONS 1, 2, and 3.\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--ROUND, GLOBULAR or nearly so, having the axial and\r\ntransverse diameters about equal, the former often shorter by less\r\nthan one-quarter of the latter. The ends are often so flattened as to\r\nlook truncated, when the fruit appears to be cylindrical or\r\nglobular-oblate.\r\n\r\nORDERS, SECTIONS, and SUB-SECTIONS, as above.\r\n\r\nCLASS IV.--OBLONG, in which the axis is longer than the transverse\r\ndiameter, or appears so. These may also be truncate or cylindrical.\r\n\r\nORDERS, SECTIONS, and SUB-SECTIONS, as above.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] As translated for R.

The trees cultivated in the Northern States are\r\nyet too young for us to judge of their characteristics, but they\r\nappear to be healthy and vigorous.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, flat, regular.\r\n\r\nSurface smooth, greenish-white, rarely blushed with red.\r\n\r\nBasin broad, shallow, and regular or wavy; Eye medium, open.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, acute; Stem rather long; Flesh yellowish, firm, rather\r\ntough, but juicy, rich and sweet.\r\n\r\nThis variety keeps well, lasting until May. Not yet sufficiently\r\ntested in the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Campfield.=\r\n\r\nNEWARK SWEETING.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 52.--CAMPFIELD.]\r\n\r\nTree vigorous, spreading, productive. This fruit is especially\r\nvaluable for cider, but it may be used also in the kitchen; being a\r\nlong keeper and often beautifully colored at maturity in the spring,\r\nit is often exposed on the fruit-stands, where it attracts purchasers\r\nby the great beauty of its brilliant colors.\r\n\r\nFruit always fair, but its figure is variable, being sometimes\r\nglobular or conical. The characteristic form is round-oblate, regular;\r\nSize medium.\r\n\r\nSurface very smooth, of a dull green, often suffused with a faint\r\nblush on the exposed side; but at maturity, bright lemon yellow,\r\nshaded with carmine; Dots minute, gray and indented.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, regular; Eye rather large, closed; Segments of medium\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nCavity regular, with medium width and depth; Stem medium, rather\r\nstout.\r\n\r\nCore wide, regular, closed, meeting the eye; Seeds numerous, plump;\r\nFlesh white, firm, tough; Juice very sweet and rich at maturity,\r\nmaking excellent cider.\r\n\r\nSeason, December until March.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dillingham.=\r\n\r\nThis variety was found in an old orchard of D.C.

Not highly esteemed nor largely cultivated,\r\nthough its productiveness and sweetness would render it desirable for\r\nstock-feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ene's Winter Sweet.=\r\n\r\nFrom J.S. Downer, Elkton, Kentucky; a southern fruit of some merit.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, flat, regular; Surface roughish, uneven,\r\ngreenish-yellow, blushed and russeted; Dots numerous, minute, russet\r\nveined.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, regular, leather-cracked; Eye large, open.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy, brown; Stem medium.\r\n\r\nCore round, closed, clasping; Seeds numerous, angular, imperfect;\r\nFlesh yellow, fine grained; Flavor very sweet, rich; Quality quite\r\ngood; Use, table; Season, December.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Green Sweet.=\r\n\r\nHONEY GREENING.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 54.--GREEN SWEET.]\r\n\r\nTree vigorous and productive in most situations where cultivated, but\r\nis not much planted in the West.\r\n\r\nFruit rather small, regular, and usually flat, though sometimes\r\nconical; Surface smooth, green; Dots whitish, with green bases.\r\n\r\nBasin rather shallow and wavy; Eye large, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular and brown; Stem long and stout.\r\n\r\nCore closed, regular, meeting the eye, containing numerous angular,\r\nacuminate brown seeds; Flesh greenish-white, breaking, tender, juicy\r\nand fine grained; very sweet, and valued for baking and market; those\r\nwho do not admire sweet apples would hardly consider it second rate.\r\n\r\nSeason from December to February, or March.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Haskell's Sweet.=\r\n\r\nFound in the orchard of Dr. Geo. Haskell, at Rockford, Illinois.\r\n\r\nFruit large, flat, regular; Surface green, bronzy; Dots numerous,\r\nlarge, white.\r\n\r\nBasin deep; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, acute, wavy; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore closed; Seeds numerous, plump; Flesh yellow, juicy; Flavor sweet,\r\nrich; Quality very good; Use, baking; Season August, September.\r\n\r\nA practical test at the table of mine host must convince any one that\r\neither the apple or the cook, or both, are eminently deserving. This\r\nis supposed to be the Massachusetts variety of the same name.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hay Boys.=\r\n\r\nI do not know where this summer apple was produced, or christened with\r\nits peculiar cognomen; Specimens received from H.N.

Foliage abundant,\r\nand quite dark colored.\r\n\r\nFruit always fair, regular, flat, and of large size; Surface smooth,\r\npale yellow, with scattered dots that are often colored.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, regular, often having concentric cracks; Eye small and\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular; Stem short, rather thick.\r\n\r\nCore medium width and closed, clasping the eye; Axis very short; Seeds\r\nvariable, some being plump and some imperfect; Flesh yellowish-white,\r\nbreaking, rather dry, but very sweet; Quality good; and considered by\r\nsome persons the very best baking apple of its season, which is from\r\nNovember to January or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mountain Sweet.=\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINEER.\r\n\r\nFrom Pennsylvania; exhibited by Joel Wood, before the Ohio Pomological\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nFruit large, beautiful, but too delicate for transportation, oblate;\r\nSurface smooth, light, yellow; Dots minute.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, wavy; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, acute, wavy; Stem short, slender.\r\n\r\nCore wide, open, dark, clasping the eye; Seeds numerous, pointed;\r\nFlesh white, breaking, very tender, fine grained, juicy; Flavor sweet;\r\nQuality good to very good; Use, table, baking; Season, December.\r\n\r\nA rival of _Broadwell_ or _Ladies' Sweeting_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Munson Sweet.=\r\n\r\nORANGE SWEET.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 57.--MUNSON SWEET.]\r\n\r\nThis New England variety is considered quite promising in its new\r\nwestern homes, where, however, it is not yet widely known or tested.\r\nTree vigorous, spreading, and productive when established; said to be\r\na regular bearer.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, flat; Surface smooth, green, becoming yellow; Dots\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nBasin small, abrupt, often folded or plaited; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy, green; Stem medium or short.\r\n\r\nCore small, closed; Seeds plump; Flesh yellowish-white, fine grained,\r\ntender, juicy; Flavor very sweet; Quality nearly first rate; Valuable\r\nfor baking; Season early winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Snepps'.=\r\n\r\nJNO. SNEPPS'.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 58.--SNEPPS'.]\r\n\r\nThis fine apple is believed to have originated at Edinburgh, Indiana,\r\nand was brought to the notice of the State Society by the orchardist\r\nwhose name it bears, and by whom it has been distributed. As it\r\nappears to be distinct from any known fruit, it is here described.\r\nTree vigorous and sufficiently productive.\r\n\r\nFruit above medium, almost large, flat, generally regular.\r\n\r\nSurface nearly smooth, of a dull green, becoming pale yellow, with\r\nnumerous dark dots, that often give it a gray appearance.\r\n\r\nBasin rather shallow, sometimes folded or wavy; Eye large and closed;\r\nSegments of the calyx coarse.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, regular, rather deep; Stem medium to short, stout.\r\n\r\nCore large but closed; Seeds numerous, pointed, brown; Flesh\r\nyellowish, breaking, fine grained, juicy; Flavor very rich, and\r\nagreeably sweet when ripe; Use, fine dessert fruit, and good for\r\ncooking; Season, December to March.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Superb Sweet.=\r\n\r\nThis variety is worthy of more attention than it has received; native\r\nof Massachusetts, where it is a vigorous and productive tree. Its\r\nperiod of maturity makes it less valuable than it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\nFruit above medium, roundish; Surface smooth, of a pale yellow color,\r\noften shaded with red.\r\n\r\nBasin rather shallow, broad; Calyx large, open.\r\n\r\nCavity regular, deep; Stalk long.\r\n\r\nFlesh white, fine grained, tender, juicy; Flavor rich, sweet.\r\n\r\nCole gives its season as September and October, in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trumbull Sweet.=\r\n\r\nFENTON SWEET.\r\n\r\nThis is another fine white sweet apple, originating in Ohio, which,\r\nnotwithstanding its beauty, is less esteemed on account of its season,\r\nbut its productiveness makes it valuable for stock-feeding. Tree\r\nvigorous, spreading, productive, and an early bearer.\r\n\r\nFruit above medium, regular, flat; Surface very smooth, pale yellow,\r\nor white, resembling ivory; Dots scattering, minute.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, regular; Eye large, rather open.\r\n\r\nCavity deep; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore closed; Seeds numerous, plump; Flesh white, fine grained,\r\nbreaking, juicy; Flavor very sweet; Quality very good; Use, baking and\r\nstock; Season September and October.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--FLAT APPLES.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--REGULAR.+\r\n\r\nSECTION 1.--SWEET.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTION 2.--STRIPED.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Baltimore.=--[_Of Elliott._]\r\n\r\nFLUSHING SPITZENBERG, OF NORTHWEST.--CABLE'S GILLIFLOWER.--ROYAL\r\nPIPPIN IN ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 59.--BALTIMORE.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of this very satisfactory second rate fruit is unknown,\r\nthough it is extensively cultivated in western orchards, especially in\r\nthe lake country, for it is scarcely known within the Ohio river fruit\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nTree thrifty, sufficiently vigorous but with slender growth, very\r\nproductive, spreading.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, regular, oblate, almost round in some specimens, Surface\r\nsmooth, red, striped with deep red and often covered with whitish or\r\ngray markings that give it a blue appearance like a bloom; Dots\r\nscattered, large, yellow or fawn color.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, brown; Stem short to medium.\r\n\r\nCore large, closed; Seeds numerous, plump; Flesh yellow, fine grained,\r\njuicy, almost sweet, aromatic, lacking character; Of second quality,\r\nbut valuable for market; December and January; Not disposed to rot,\r\ndoes not show bruises.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Butter.=\r\n\r\nFULKERSON'S.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 60.--BUTTER.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of this fruit has not been definitely traced, and though\r\nnot very widely diffused, it is a prime favorite with its\r\nacquaintances, and the lovers of rich apple-butter.\r\n\r\nFruit small, very regular, oblate; Surface very smooth, and so covered\r\nwith mixed red as rarely to show the yellow ground color; upon this\r\nare laid darker stripes of deep red; Dots minute and inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nBasin medium, regular, or folded; Eye rather large, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, regular, brown; Stem of medium thickness, rather long.\r\n\r\nCore wide, large, closed; with large, plump, pointed seeds; Flesh\r\nyellow, tender, fine grained, juicy; with a sweet, rich and aromatic\r\nflavor.

Tree vigorous, healthy, spreading,\r\nround, with branches sufficiently open; Shoots dark olive; Foliage\r\nlarge, dark green.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, globular-oblate, regular; Surface smooth,\r\ngreenish-yellow, covered with dull red in confused stripes and shaded\r\nwith gray that gives the fruit a purple hue; Dots minute and few; Skin\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, wavy or folded; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide or acute, deep, green or brown; Stem short, rather stout.\r\n\r\nCore small, closed; Seeds numerous, plump, pale; Flesh yellow, dry,\r\nfirm; Flavor very sweet; Quality inferior, for the dessert; Use,\r\nbaking, market, stock, cider; Season from December to March and later,\r\nkeeping very sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Putnam Sweet.=\r\n\r\nOriginated near Marietta, Ohio.\r\n\r\nFruit large, flat, regular; Surface smooth, mixed, splashed and\r\nstriped deep red; Dots numerous, large.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, shallow, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore roundish, flattened, open, clasping the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\npointed, pale; Flesh tender; Flavor sweet; quality very good; Use,\r\nkitchen, stock; Season August, September.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Richmond.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 65.--RICHMOND.]\r\n\r\nDescribed by F.R. Elliott, author of _American Fruit Growers' Guide_,\r\nand named for our mutual friend, D.C. Richmond, near Sandusky, Ohio,\r\nwho found it in an old seedling orchard with several other good\r\nvarieties. The seeds were supposed to have been brought from the old\r\nFrench orchards of Canada. Tree large, vigorous, productive, and would\r\nappear to have been hardy.\r\n\r\nMr. Elliott says:\r\n\r\n\"Fruit large; Form roundish, occasional specimens have one side a\r\nlittle enlarged; Color light yellow ground, mostly or quite overspread\r\nwith light and dark red stripes, many dots or specks of light russet;\r\nStem varying, mostly short, slender; Cavity deep, open, regular, a\r\nlittle brownish at bottom; Calyx large, segments long; Basin deep,\r\nopen, uniformly furrowed; Flesh white, tender, juicy, delicate, sweet;\r\nCore medium; Seeds large, full; Season October to December.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sweet Vandervere.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 66.--SWEET VANDERVERE.]\r\n\r\nThis is another western favorite with the admirers of sweet apples.\r\nTree sufficiently vigorous, healthy, and productive; twigs slender,\r\nlike those of the true Vanderveres.\r\n\r\nFruit of good size, from full medium to large, regular, oblate, and\r\nresembling the Pennsylvania Vandervere; surface very smooth, yellow,\r\nshaded with mixed red, and striped with dull or dark red; Dots yellow,\r\nscattered, indented.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, wide, deep, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity sometimes wide and regular, or acute; Stem long, slender.\r\n\r\nCore regular, heart-shaped, closed; Seeds medium to long, angular;\r\nFlesh firm, breaking, yellow; Flavor sweet, pleasant; Quality not\r\nfirst rate, valued for baking and for stock; Season December and\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--FLAT APPLES.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--REGULAR.+\r\n\r\nSECTION 1.--SWEET.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTION 3.--RUSSET.\r\n\r\nNONE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--FLAT APPLES.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--REGULAR.+\r\n\r\nSECTION 2.--SOUR.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTION 1.--SELF-COLORED.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Better Than Good.=\r\n\r\nJUICY BITE.\r\n\r\nLike our standard authority, I am obliged to quote from the American\r\nPomological Society's Transactions.

Mr. Elliott thinks this\r\nvariety may have had its origin in Virginia. Tree moderately vigorous\r\nand productive.\r\n\r\nFruit full medium, regular, oblate, rarely inclined to be angular,\r\nsometimes slightly conical; Surface very smooth, whitish, or waxen,\r\noccasionally blushed with pale carmine, making it very beautiful; Dots\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, narrow, folded, wavy and irregular; Eye closed; Segments\r\nreflexed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, brown; Stem rather long.\r\n\r\nCore regular, small, pyriform, closed, clasping the eye; Seeds small,\r\ncompressed; Flesh white, breaking, fine grained, juicy, sub-acid;\r\nQuality very good and preferred as a dessert fruit to the _Maiden's\r\nBlush_ which it much resembles without having the peculiar flavor of\r\nthat variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cornfield.=\r\n\r\nA southern variety received from J.S.

For the commercial\r\norchard, however, it is falling into disfavor with the market men,\r\nbecause of its uncertainty, and its proneness to be defective on some\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nTree spreading, healthy and vigorous; the limbs are very strongly\r\nattached to the trunk by a woody enlargement at their base, and the\r\npale olive twigs are remarkable for their peculiar mode of production\r\nin twos and threes from a common origin.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, regular, oblate, sometimes almost round, as described by\r\nDowning, but this is rare in the West, where the oblate form prevails.\r\nSurface smooth, clear, waxy yellow, very rarely blushed; Dots\r\nnumerous, minute, green.\r\n\r\nBasin regular, narrow, abrupt; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore round, closed, not meeting the eye; Seeds large, pointed; Flesh\r\ntender, breaking, juicy, acid to sub-acid, agreeable; Of first quality\r\nfor table or kitchen during the month of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Faust.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 70.--FAUST.]\r\n\r\nThis very nice apple, received from S.W. Westbrooke, of Greensboro,\r\nN.C., deserves the commendation of its southern admirers.\r\n\r\nFruit regular, globular-oblate, of medium size; Surface smooth,\r\nyellow, with a white bloom and sunken white dots.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, folded; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, green; Stem medium, to long.\r\n\r\nCore wide, closed, scarcely meeting the eye; Seeds angular; Flesh\r\nyellow, fine grained; Flavor sub-acid, aromatic, and first quality for\r\ntable or dessert use, in November or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Finley.=\r\n\r\nABBOTT?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 71.--FINLEY.]\r\n\r\nThis fine fruit originated in Kentucky and is cultivated to some\r\nextent in Southern Indiana, where it is considered entitled to the\r\nmeed of excellence, and preferred to the Early Harvest on the one\r\nhand, and to the Maiden's Blush on the other; and in its season, it\r\ncompetes with both, being useful in July for the kitchen, and ripening\r\ngradually until September.\r\n\r\nTree large, spreading, vigorous and productive.\r\n\r\nFruit large to very large, regular, globular-oblate, slightly conical;\r\nSurface smooth, greenish-yellow, becoming a clear lemon yellow at\r\nmaturity; Dots minute, gray, scattering.\r\n\r\nBasin rather wide, wavy; Eye small, closed; Segments reflexed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, medium to deep, regular, brown; Stem long, yellow.\r\n\r\nCore heart-shaped, regular, closed, clasping the eye; Seeds few,\r\nlarge, plump, and some imperfect; Flesh yellow, breaking, fine\r\ngrained, juicy, acid, almost first quality; Valuable for kitchen and\r\nmarket; Season August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fink.=\r\n\r\nFINK'S SEEDLING.\r\n\r\nThis long keeper was brought before the notice of the Ohio Pomological\r\nSociety many years ago by Mr. Clarke, of Somerset, Ohio. Mr. Elliott\r\nconsidered it the same as Tewksbury Winter Blush, and introduces\r\nFink's Seedling as a synonym of that variety. Others think it a\r\ndifferent fruit, among whom is that practical Pomologist, the\r\nSecretary of that association, M.B. Bateham, Esq., who has propagated\r\nand planted the trees extensively. It was described as Fink's Seedling\r\nin the Ohio Cultivator, May, 1847. At the meeting of 1854, the merits\r\nand claims of this variety were freely discussed, and the Society\r\nnamed it the _Fink_, after admitting that it was an original seedling,\r\nas stated by Mr. Fink, in whose seedling orchard it had originated.\r\n\r\nTree of strong upright growth, a profuse and annual bearer.\r\n\r\nFruit small, regular, roundish-oblate; Surface very smooth, polished,\r\ngreenish-yellow, blushed with brownish-red; Flesh whitish, breaking,\r\njuicy, mild sub-acid; remarkable for its keeping qualities, remaining\r\nsound until the second season, and has been shown in May after having\r\nbeen kept over two winters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fulton.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig 72.--FULTON.]\r\n\r\nOrigin, Canton County, Illinois.

Our\r\nIllinois orchardists do not commend it so highly as when first\r\nintroduced; not fully satisfactory where planted in Ohio on limestone\r\nclays.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Golden Seedling.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 73.--GOLDEN SEEDLING.]\r\n\r\nSaid to have originated with Mr. Riehl, of St. Louis, cultivated and\r\ndistributed by Geo. Husmann, of Hermann, Mo., in whose orchard I\r\ngathered it.\r\n\r\nFruit large, handsome, regular, and oblate; Surface smooth,\r\ngreenish-yellow, and blushed; Dots scattered, minute.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, regular; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore medium, regular, meeting the eye, closed; Seeds numerous,\r\nangular, pale; Flesh yellow, juicy, rich; \"Very good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Green Crank.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 74.--GREEN CRANK.]\r\n\r\nI have received this southern apple from Kentucky, Tenn., and also\r\nfrom Georgia, but have not yet fruited it.

Tree vigorous, with a round\r\nspreading head; Shoots stout, olive.\r\n\r\nFruit large, regular, oblate or slightly conic; Surface waxy yellow,\r\nrarely shaded or blushed, becomes oily or greasy when kept.\r\n\r\nBasin rather wide, wavy; Cavity wide, sometimes folded; Stem short,\r\nmedium and long.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed, scarcely clasping the eye; Seeds generally\r\nimperfect; Flesh yellowish-white, very tender, fine grained, juicy;\r\nFlavor very pleasant, mild sub-acid, rich; Season August to September;\r\nan amateur's fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hawthornden.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 76.--HAWTHORNDEN.]\r\n\r\nThis famous Scotch fruit appears to do very well in this country, but\r\nit must yield the palm to its American cousin and representative, the\r\nMaiden's Blush, which possesses all its good qualities as a market and\r\nkitchen fruit, with attractive appearance.\r\n\r\nTree spreading, vigorous and productive; an early bearer.\r\n\r\nFruit large, regular, and very flat; Surface perfectly smooth, always\r\nfair, and of a beautiful white, very rarely and faintly blushed; Dots\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, narrow, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy, green; Stem medium.\r\n\r\nCore wide, regular, somewhat open, meeting the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\nangular, imperfect, brown; Flesh greenish-white, breaking, fine\r\ngrained, juicy; Flavor acid, aromatic; of second quality for table,\r\nbut first rate for cooking; Uses, kitchen and market; Season October.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Junaliska.=\r\n\r\nThis apple originated in the Cherokee country, where it is highly\r\nesteemed, and fruited in Ohio and Kentucky this year.\r\n\r\nFruit large, roundish, or flattened, slightly conic, regular; Surface\r\nsmooth, yellow, with some russet, chiefly about the apex; sometimes\r\nblushed; Dots minute, gray.\r\n\r\nBasin rather small, regular; Eye small, long, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, acute, brown; Stem quite short, knobby.\r\n\r\nCore wide, heart-shaped, regular, closed; Axis short; seeds few,\r\nshort, plump; Flesh yellow, breaking, granular; flavor sub-acid,\r\nspicy, rich; Quality good; Use, table and kitchen; Season November,\r\nand through the winter.\r\n\r\nIt may be destined to supply the place of the _Rhode Island Greening_,\r\nwhere that variety does not succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kane.=\r\n\r\nCAIN.\r\n\r\nOrigin, Delaware. Tree upright, sufficiently vigorous. Has been\r\nconfounded with the Bohanon, but is distinct.\r\n\r\nFruit small, regular, oblate, somewhat conic; Beautiful for the\r\ndessert; Surface very smooth, waxen yellow, blushed with bright\r\ncrimson; Flesh whitish, crisp, juicy, acid and pleasant; October and\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lady.=\r\n\r\nAPI PETIT, ETC.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful little French apple has been fully naturalized in our\r\ncountry, and has received the enthusiastic admiration of the American\r\npeople. The fruit needs to be entirely perfect to meet with favor as\r\nan ornament to the table, for which use it is especially adapted;\r\nunfortunately it is often overgrown and irregularly developed.\r\nWherever produced in proper size and color, it is one of the most\r\nprofitable varieties, commanding fancy prices at the period of\r\nChristmas decorations. In the rich soils of the West it is apt to be\r\ntoo large, and has generally failed to meet the requisitions; but it\r\nsucceeds well in Michigan, and the neighboring region of Indiana.\r\n\r\nTree of medium size, very close and upright, healthy and productive;\r\nShoots very dark; the foliage small, crowded, curled, and very dark.\r\n\r\nFruit very small, quite flat, very regular; Surface very smooth,\r\nshining or polished, of a pale waxen yellow, nearly covered with\r\nbright carmine, which contrasts finely with the ground color, wherever\r\nthe fruit has been shaded by a leaf; Dots minute.\r\n\r\nBasin medium, rather abrupt; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, deep, regular; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore regular, wide, closed; Seeds numerous; Axis very short; Flesh\r\nwhite, breaking, tender and juicy when ripe; with a mild sub-acid\r\nflavor; Use ornament and dessert; Season December until March.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Maiden's Blush.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 77.--MAIDEN'S BLUSH.]\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and profitable fruit has received the unqualified\r\napprobation of thirteen out of the eighteen States that have reported\r\nto the American Pomological Society. It is a native of New Jersey, and\r\nis still held in high repute there as a market apple. The tree is\r\nhardy, vigorous, spreading and productive, beginning to bear quite\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, to large, regular, flat and very handsome; Surface very\r\nsmooth, polished, of a pale waxen yellow and blushed with bright\r\ncarmine; Dots minute.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, regular or wavy; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy; Stem medium to short.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed, meeting the eye; Seeds numerous, brown; Flesh\r\nwhite, breaking, fine grained, juicy; Flavor acid, aromatic, and to\r\nmost palates not agreeable at the dessert, but very good when cooked,\r\nand requiring but a short time to be reduced to a delicious pulp of\r\nlight color. This apple is also used for drying and makes a very\r\nlight colored product, that is much admired by dealers. Season\r\nSeptember and October, but may be used in the kitchen during August.\r\n\r\n=Bachelor's Blush= appears to be a variety of the above; found in\r\nBurlington County, New Jersey, and exhibited before the American\r\nPomological Society at the Rochester meeting in 1864, by Wm. Parry, as\r\na valuable, and distinct variety. Having examined the trees as they\r\ngrew together in the orchard, the resemblance to Maiden's Blush was\r\nvery apparent. The fruit is larger, and for market purposes is\r\nconsidered more profitable. The two may be different, but are very\r\nmuch alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pickard's Reserve.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 78.--PICKARD'S RESERVE.]\r\n\r\nGrown in Parke County, Indiana, from seed brought from North Carolina.\r\nThis apple was first brought to my notice by Jno. C. Teas, of\r\nRaysville, Indiana. Considerably grown in that State. Tree hardy; the\r\noriginal is still standing in Rockville.\r\n\r\nFruit large, flat, somewhat unequal; Surface smooth, pale yellow; Dots\r\nscattered, minute.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, regular, rather deep; Eye quite small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, wavy, brown; Stem short to medium.\r\n\r\nCore irregular, closed, scarcely clasping the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\nangular, dark brown; Flesh whitish-yellow, fine grained, tender,\r\njuicy, with a sub-acid, aromatic flavor, making this a fruit of first\r\nquality for table or kitchen use; Season December and January.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rhode Island Greening.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 79.--RHODE ISLAND GREENING.]\r\n\r\nFrom its name this apple would appear, like the Peck's Pleasant, to\r\nhave come from the sea-girt State. It is a universal favorite, and is\r\nfound to succeed well in a great many situations; but there are some\r\nportions of the West where it has failed to give satisfaction, being\r\nslow to come into bearing, becoming an autumn instead of a winter\r\nfruit, and falling badly from the trees before picking time. In\r\nsandstone soils, however, even in Southern Indiana and Illinois, it\r\ndoes better than on the limestone clays; the fruit attains an\r\nenormous size, but matures too early for a winter apple.\r\n\r\nTree very vigorous, crooked, spreading, productive; Shoots stout,\r\ndark, with dark foliage.\r\n\r\nFruit large to very large, varying in shape from globular or round to\r\nflat, which is the prevailing and characteristic form. Surface smooth\r\nin the North, somewhat rough and often quite russeted in the South, a\r\ndull green, becoming yellow at maturity; Dots grey, irregular,\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\nBasin regular, small and russeted to a greater or less extent,\r\nsometimes extending half way down the sides of the fruit; Eye small to\r\nmedium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular; Stem medium to long, curved, often reddish.\r\n\r\nCore roundish-oval, regular, closed, clasping the eye; seeds numerous,\r\nangular, dark; Flesh very yellow, breaking, tender, juicy, with a\r\nrich, acid flavor, making it a superior cooking apple, and very fine\r\nfor the dessert when fully ripe; Quality almost first rate; Season\r\nOctober to December--in the North, keeping until March.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tewksbury Winter Blush.=\r\n\r\nThis long-keeping variety was described by Coxe as having its origin\r\nin New Jersey. It has already been named in connection with the Fink,\r\nwhich resembles it very closely, and, like it, the chief excellence of\r\nthis variety consists in its superior keeping qualities.\r\n\r\nThe tree is vigorous, upright, productive, and holds the apples well.\r\n\r\nFruit small, regular, flat; Surface smooth, yellow, blushed; Flesh\r\nyellow, breaking, juicy, well flavored, and retains its characters for\r\na long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Virginia Greening.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 80.--VIRGINIA GREENING.]\r\n\r\nThis apple is supposed from its name to have originated in Virginia.\r\nIt is cultivated chiefly in the Southern States, and in those parts of\r\nthe Northwest to which Southerners have migrated. Its chief merit is\r\nits long keeping. Tree large, spreading, productive.\r\n\r\nFruit large, regular, flat to roundish, generally the former; Surface\r\nsmooth, dull green and often bronzy, never blushed; Dots scattered,\r\nlarge, white or gray, with whitish rings around them.\r\n\r\nBasin regular, wide, shallow; Eye small, open.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, green; Stem long to medium.\r\n\r\nCore regular, turbinate, closed, meeting the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\nlong; Flesh white, firm, breaking, sub-acid; Fit only for the kitchen;\r\nA long keeper; March and April; often subject to Bitter-rot.\r\n\r\n\r\n=White Fall Pippin.=\r\n\r\nFALL PIPPIN OF LOUISVILLE.\r\n\r\nThis handsome fruit is seen in quantities in the Louisville market\r\nevery fall. Its cultivation does not appear to have been widely\r\nextended, nor has its origin been traced. It has been thought to\r\nresemble the Spanish Reinette, with which I have not had an\r\nopportunity to compare it.\r\n\r\nFruit very large, slightly uneven, roundish-flattened or\r\nglobular-oblate; Surface smooth, pale yellow, not bronzed or blushed,\r\nbut having a whitish striping toward the stem end; Dots scattered,\r\nminute, dark.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, narrow, deep and folded; Eye small, long, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy; Stem very short.\r\n\r\nCore wide, regular, somewhat open, clasping the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\nangular; Flesh yellowish-white, breaking, juicy; Flavor sub-acid,\r\naromatic and rich; Useful for cooking, drying, and table; Season\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n=White Juneating.=\r\n\r\nJUNEATING, _Coxe_.--YELLOW JUNE.--EARLY MAY?\r\n\r\nDowning thinks this a very old variety, mentioned by Evelyn in 1660,\r\nand by Ray in 1688. It has long been known in the West and South as a\r\nvery early apple, and valued on this account, though quite small. The\r\ntree resembles that of the Early Harvest in the color and arrangement\r\nof its twigs.\r\n\r\nFruit flat, regular; Surface smooth, pale yellow.\r\n\r\nBasin not deep, slightly folded; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, shallow; Stem long, slender.\r\n\r\nFlesh breaking, whitish, juicy till over-ripe, when it is dry; Flavor\r\nsub-acid; Use table and market; Season June.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Winter Pippin.=\r\n\r\nWINTER PIPPIN OF GENEVA.\r\n\r\nThis very handsome fruit was received from T.T. Lyon, of Plymouth,\r\nMichigan, marked as having been received from Western New York. The\r\nsame fruit was a very strong competitor for the Greeley prize before\r\nthe Committee of the American Institute, and is believed to be the\r\nsame as that described by Downing as the _Winter Pippin of Geneva_.\r\n\r\nTree thrifty, branches spreading; Said to be productive.\r\n\r\nFruit large, oblate, regular, or slightly unequal; Surface smooth,\r\npale yellow, with a bright crimson cheek; Dots numerous, minute.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, wavy, or plaited; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity regular, green, rather deep; Stem long.\r\n\r\nCore medium, regular, closed, clasping the eye; Seeds numerous, plump;\r\nFlesh yellowish-white, fine grained, juicy, sub-acid; Season January\r\nuntil May. A limited acquaintance does not justify me in giving such\r\nhigh praises as those bestowed upon this fruit by Mr. Downing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yellow Foster.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 81.--YELLOW FOSTER.]\r\n\r\nThis apple is a favorite with that worthy pioneer Pomologist of\r\nSouthern Ohio, H.N. Gillett, of Lawrence County, to whom I am under\r\nobligations for this and many other varieties.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, regular, oblate; Surface smooth,\r\ngreenish-yellow; Dots scattered, minute green.\r\n\r\nBasin of medium depth and size, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, regular; Stem of medium size and length.\r\n\r\nCore medium, wide, closed, not meeting the eye; Seeds not numerous,\r\nmedium; Flesh yellow, fine grained, tender, juicy; Flavor sub-acid and\r\naromatic; Of first quality for table; During October.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--FLAT APPLES.\r\n\r\n+ORDER I.--REGULAR.+\r\n\r\nSECTION 2.--SOUR.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTION 2.--STRIPED.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Abram.=\r\n\r\nFATHER ABRAHAM, of Illinois, not that of Coxe.\r\n\r\nThis little southern favorite is not extensively cultivated in the\r\nNorth, except where southern settlers have introduced it. It is found\r\nin Illinois, Indiana and Missouri. Origin believed to have been in\r\nVirginia, whence I have received specimens and trees. In Kentucky it\r\nis found to be a hardy drooping tree, holding the fruit well; annually\r\nproductive, valued for cider, and keeping till July of next year.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, globular-oblate, uneven; Surface not smooth, yellowish\r\ngreen, mixed, red, with stripes and splashes; the whole presenting a\r\ngray appearance; Dots minute, scattered.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, wide, wavy; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, regular; Stem long, inclined.\r\n\r\nCore medium, regular, closed; Seeds numerous, short, plump, pale;\r\nFlesh greenish-yellow, fine grained, juicy; flavor mild sub-acid,\r\nrich; almost first quality; keeping until May or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=American Pippin.=\r\n\r\nGRINDSTONE.\r\n\r\nThis fruit is chiefly valued for keeping very late into the summer.\r\nCoxe commends it for its cider, rating it as nearly equal to the\r\nGrey-House; he says that fourteen bushels are required to make a\r\nbarrel of cider. The apples hang well to the tree, and will bear a\r\nconsiderable amount of freezing. They are so firm as to suffer little\r\nfrom bruising, and are not disposed to rot when thus injured. A\r\nfruitman once said of their ability to withstand rough usage, that the\r\napples might be whipped off the tree with a hoop-pole, shoveled into a\r\ncart, dumped upon the ground, and have some dirt thrown upon them, and\r\nthat they would keep until next July; but, he added, they are then as\r\ngood as dried apples; so lightly are they esteemed for table use.\r\n\r\nThe tree is thrifty, with a low, spreading head and depending\r\nbranches; very productive; notwithstanding the fruit is dry and\r\ndeficient in flavor, it is considered profitable, because so easily\r\nkept until May and June, when it commands the highest price, because\r\nof the rarity of green fruit at that season.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, regular, very flat; Surface rough, sometimes\r\nvein-russeted, dull green, covered with mixed red, and shaded with\r\nstripes of brick-dust color; Dots numerous, large, gray.\r\n\r\nBasin very shallow, wide, regular or plaited; Eye quite small, open.\r\n\r\nCavity regular, brown, this color extending over the base of the\r\nfruit; Stem medium, often thick and knobby.\r\n\r\nCore wide, irregular, closed; Seeds numerous, plump, brown; Flesh\r\nyellow, breaking, dry, very firm; Flavor mild sub-acid; Quality poor;\r\nUses kitchen and market, which last means that it may be sold to those\r\nwho do not appreciate the summer fruits of May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Baldwin.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 82.--BALDWIN.]\r\n\r\nThis celebrated apple of New England has been widely distributed over\r\nthe country, but has not met with universal favor in the West and\r\nSouth; first, because it is apt to become a fall or early winter\r\nfruit, instead of a keeping apple; and secondly, because it is not\r\nwell adapted to our palates; moreover, the tree has been considered\r\ntender, having suffered extensively during the cold winters; this is\r\nespecially true in the nursery. Its productiveness and fair quality\r\nwill, however, always make the Baldwin a favorite over a large portion\r\nof our country, and the New England settlers must have this variety.\r\n\r\nTree robust, spreading, very productive; Foliage large, dark, on\r\nshoots that are stout and have a rich brown bark.\r\n\r\nFruit large, frequently round, and sometimes almost conical, but\r\ngenerally inclined to be flattened, so as to be classed by measurement\r\nas oblate; large specimens in southern latitudes are very apt to be\r\nunequal, and to have their axis inclined, or to be what is called\r\nlop-sided; surface smooth, rich yellow where shaded, but the exposed\r\nparts quite covered with deep red, which is mixed so as to conceal the\r\nground color, and also to obscure the stripes of deeper red that\r\nprevail; this fruit is also frequently marked with veined russet,\r\noverlying the red color, or excluding it; Dots minute, and yellow, or\r\ngray where the red prevails.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, often abrupt and narrow, generally waved, folded or\r\nplaited, and these marks are quite characteristic; Eye large and open,\r\nfrom the shortness of the calyx. On this account the variety is\r\nconsidered very subject to the attacks of the Codling-moth.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular or wavy, generally brown; Stem medium to long,\r\noften curved or inclined, sufficiently stout.\r\n\r\nCore medium, regular, closed, meeting, sometimes clasping the eye;\r\nSeeds numerous, long, angular, imperfect; flesh yellow, breaking,\r\nfrequently coarse-grained, juicy, sub-acid, rich; some northern\r\nspecimens are fine-grained and almost first quality; those from the\r\nSouth are coarse, poor and scarcely second-rate for table use, but are\r\ngood for cooking; Season October to January, occasionally keeping\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bethlemite.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 83.--BETHLEMITE.]\r\n\r\nThis apple has frequently been exhibited before the Ohio Pomological\r\nSociety, by friends Lipsey, Morris and Benedict, of Morrow County, to\r\nwhich region its cultivation appears to have been confined. The origin\r\nof the fruit is obscure.\r\n\r\nTree thrifty, hardy, productive, upright.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, flat, or oblate-globular, regular; surface smooth, dull\r\nred or bright red, mixed, on yellow, with broken splashes of crimson;\r\nDots distinct, large, gray and yellow.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, deep, regular or folded, leather-cracked; Eye medium,\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nCavity rather wide, regular, brown; Stem medium to short.\r\n\r\nCore regular, neat, closed, just meeting the eye; Axis short; Seeds\r\nnumerous, short, very plump, pale; Flesh yellowish-white, breaking,\r\njuicy, sub-acid, aromatic; Quality good, for table and cooking; Season\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blondin.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 84.--BLONDIN.]\r\n\r\nThis fine fruit originated with the veteran Pomologist of Indiana,\r\nReuben Ragan.\r\n\r\nFruit very large, oblate, unequal; Surface rough, greenish-yellow,\r\nsplashed and striped with red; Dots numerous, large, gray.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, folded; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, deep, brown; Stem short, rather slender inclined.\r\n\r\nCore medium or small, regular, closed, clasping the eye; Seeds plump,\r\npointed, brown; Flesh greenish-yellow, fine-grained, tender, juicy;\r\nFlavor sub-acid; almost first rate for table and market; Season\r\nOctober and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blooming Orange.=\r\n\r\nMr. Waring considers this the handsomest apple. In 1839 he brought a\r\nlarge number of sorts from the famous Herefordshire apple orchards of\r\nEngland, of which this is the only one he retains as fully adapted to\r\nthe mountain region of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nTree a very strong, free, handsome grower, and an immense bearer,\r\nafter six or eight years' growth.\r\n\r\nFruit very large, fair, beautiful, roundish-oblate, regular; surface\r\ndark, richly clouded with claret and mahogany, on yellow ground; Eye\r\nopen; Flesh crisp, juicy, acid at first, but this merges into a rich,\r\npenetrating, very agreeable flavor.\r\n\r\nIt is of the Ribston Pippin, or Dutch Mignonne type of fruit.--[Mr. G.\r\nWaring's MS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bonum.=\r\n\r\nMAGNUM BONUM.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 85.--BONUM.]\r\n\r\nThis delicious southern fruit originated in Davidson County, North\r\nCarolina. The tree is vigorous, very productive and bears early. I\r\nreceived specimens from S.W. Westbrooke, Greensboro', North Carolina.\r\nIntroduced to the American Pomological Society at the Philadelphia\r\nmeeting, 1860, by Walter Steele, of Rockingham County, North Carolina,\r\nand highly recommended.\r\n\r\nFruit large, oblate, regular; Surface smooth, yellow, covered with\r\nmixed red, and striped; Dots distinct, large, yellow.\r\n\r\nBasin medium, regular; Eye large, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, regular, brown; Stem long, not thick, green.\r\n\r\nCore oval, small, closed, scarcely meeting the eye; Axis short; Seeds\r\nlarge, plump; Flesh yellow, firm, breaking, fine-grained, juicy;\r\nFlavor rich, sub-acid; first quality for the dessert; in September.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brandywine.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 86.--BRANDYWINE.]\r\n\r\nThis apple was found on the edge of the prairie, east of Quincy,\r\nIllinois, in the orchard of K.K. Jones, Esq., where it was supposed to\r\nhave been brought from the State of Delaware.\r\n\r\nTree large, vigorous, spreading and productive.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, oblate, roundish, slightly conic, regular; surface\r\nsmooth, greenish, covered with confused stripes of dull red; Dots\r\nscattered, white.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, abrupt, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, regular, green; Stem very short.\r\n\r\nCore small, round, closed, clasping; Seeds imperfect; Flesh\r\ngreenish-white, fine-grained, tender, juicy; Flavor sub-acid,\r\naromatic; Quality only good; Use table, kitchen; Season January,\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Buchanan's.=\r\n\r\nOrigin near Cincinnati, Ohio, in the orchard of Robert Buchanan, Esq.,\r\na gentleman long devoted to pomology. It also closely resembles the\r\nBrandywine, as grown in Illinois, already described.\r\n\r\nThis variety is much like the Minkler, which originated in Illinois,\r\nand both may have come from seeds of the Gilpin, which they resemble.\r\n\r\nTree vigorous and productive.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, oblate, regular; Surface smooth, yellow, covered with\r\nmixed red and striped bright red; Dots scattered, minute.\r\n\r\nBasin medium, folded or plaited; Eye large, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, green; Stem short or medium.\r\n\r\nCore flattened, closed, clasping the eye; Seeds numerous, plump, dark;\r\nFlesh greenish-yellow, firm, breaking; Flavor sub-acid; Quality\r\nscarcely second rate, but useful for cooking, and keeps sound until\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carolina Baldwin.=\r\n\r\nThis nice southern apple was received from S.W. Westbrooke, of\r\nGreensboro'. Of the tree I know nothing.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, oblate, regular; Surface yellow-green, with mixed red\r\nand stripes; Dots numerous, large, white.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, regular; Eye large, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular; Stem, medium to long.\r\n\r\nCore small, regular, heart-shaped, closed; Seeds pointed; Flesh\r\nyellow, fine-grained, juicy; Flavor, sub-acid; good for table in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cheese.=\r\n\r\nThis fruit was received from Lewis Sanders, of Grass Hills, Gallatin\r\nCounty, Kentucky, by whom it was grown and esteemed.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to small, oblate, regular; Surface smooth,\r\nyellowish-green, striped purple red, splashed deep red; dots\r\nscattered, gray and purple.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, regular, or abrupt and deep, in different specimens;\r\nEye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, brown; Stem long, slender.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed; Axis long; Seeds plump, pointed, dark; Flesh\r\nyellow, tender, fine-grained, juicy; Flavor sub-acid, agreeable;\r\nQuality good for the table in December and January.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Colvert.=\r\n\r\nFruit large, roundish-oblate, slightly conic, regular, often unequal;\r\nSurface smooth, yellowish-green, mixed, striped, light red; Dots\r\nscattered, distinct, white.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, abrupt, regular, folded; Eye medium.\r\n\r\nCavity rather deep, acute, brown; Stem medium.\r\n\r\nCore round, flattened, slightly open, meeting the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\nlong, pointed, imperfect; Flesh white, breaking, fine-grained, juicy;\r\nFlavor sub-acid; Quality scarcely good; Use, market chiefly; Season\r\nOctober, November.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooper.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 87.--COOPER.]\r\n\r\nThis delicious apple was introduced into the West with the scions that\r\nwere brought to the early Putnam nursery at the mouth of the Muskingum\r\nriver in 1796. Though a general favorite from its beauty, its fine\r\ntexture, and exquisite flavor, this variety does not appear to have\r\nbeen so widely spread as others very inferior to it. Though occurring\r\non the original Putnam list, and therefore an eastern variety, it does\r\nnot appear to have been recognized by cultivators in the older States,\r\nand there are those in the West who claim that it is of French origin.\r\n\r\nThe tree has a stout, upright growth, which becomes spreading with\r\nage, when the limbs stand at a right angle with the trunk; they are\r\nfrequently defaced with marks of diseased action that are called\r\n_canker_. The twigs are reddish and rather slender; the leaves are\r\npale green, large, broad.\r\n\r\nFruit large, globular-oblate, regular, sometimes unequal, light;\r\nSurface smooth, pale waxen-yellow, with a little mixed scarlet and\r\nvery distinctly marked carmine; Dots scattered, minute.\r\n\r\nBasin regular, abrupt, deep; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, green; Stem medium, green.\r\n\r\nCore small, closed, just meeting the eye; Seeds numerous, plump,\r\nshort, dark; Flesh pale yellow, fine-grained, tender, almost melting,\r\njuicy; very mild sub-acid, aromatic; of first quality for table,\r\nkitchen or market (too good for drying, but makes a superior article\r\nof _snits_); Season September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dr. Watson.=\r\n\r\nAUTUMN SEEK-NO-FURTHER OF INDIANA.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 88.--DR. WATSON.]\r\n\r\nThis delicious and beautiful dessert apple is much grown in Central\r\nand Eastern Indiana, particularly among the Friends. It was for a long\r\ntime a puzzle to the pomologists. In the meanwhile it must have a\r\nname, and without waiting for the decision of the learned, the people\r\nin different sections, without consultation, called it the _Autumn\r\nSeek-no-further_. Finally the Horticultural Societies decided that it\r\nwas an old sort named _Doctor Watson_, though upon what authority does\r\nnot appear. The fruit has not been recognized by our Eastern friends,\r\nnor by the American Pomological Society, to which it was referred in\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nTree large, spreading, very productive; Twigs slender, foliage small,\r\npale green; in the nursery it is a poor grower.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, unless when too crowded, regular, oblate,\r\nsometimes unequal; Surface smooth, mixed pale and red on waxen-yellow,\r\nbeautifully splashed with scarlet; Dots minute.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, rather deep, wide, regular, sometimes cracked; Eye\r\nmedium, open.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular or wavy, brown; Stem medium to short.\r\n\r\nCore medium, regular, closed, just meeting the eye; Axis short; Seeds\r\nplump; Flesh yellow, fine-grained, very tender and juicy, almost\r\nmelting, with a rich, aromatic, sub-acid flavor; Quality best, for\r\ntable and kitchen, from September to November; also valuable for stock\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Domine.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 89.--DOMINE.]\r\n\r\nSupposed to be a native of this country; origin unknown. Tree very\r\nthrifty, making long, stout, brown shoots, which branch from the ends,\r\nand form spurs along their sides, so that the tree has a straggling,\r\nopen head, and bears its fruit crowded along the smaller branches. It\r\nis hardy, upright, vigorous and productive. Foliage large and long,\r\nwith a peculiar curl or folding upwards, so as to show the underside\r\nof the leaves.\r\n\r\nFruit large, flat, regular, sometimes unequal; Surface\r\nyellowish-green, nearly covered with mixed red, and striped\r\nindistinctly with carmine, often vein-russeted; Dots scattered, yellow\r\nand gray, large.\r\n\r\nBasin rather shallow, folded or plaited; Eye medium to small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy, brown; Stem medium to long, slender at its\r\ninsertion into the fruit, and easily separated from it, but holding\r\nfirmly to the tree; hence care is needed in picking the fruit.\r\n\r\nCore regular, somewhat open, scarcely meeting the eye; Axis often\r\nshort; Seeds numerous, pointed, plump; Flesh light yellow, breaking,\r\ntender, juicy; flavor slightly sub-acid, rich; good, for table,\r\nkitchen, or market; Season December and January, keeping until spring\r\nin the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Duchess of Oldenburgh.=\r\n\r\nThis very beautiful striped apple is from Russia, and has proved one\r\nof the hardiest apples in our trying climate. Reports from the\r\nNorthwest are entirely satisfactory as to its hardiness.\r\n\r\nTree medium size, round-headed, sufficiently vigorous and perfectly\r\nhardy.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, regular, roundish-oblate; Surface smooth, waxen-yellow,\r\npartially covered with distinct and regular stripes and splashes of\r\nbrilliant red and carmine; often having a light bloom, such as is\r\nfound on most Russian apples.\r\n\r\nBasin regular, pretty wide; Eye large and closed.\r\n\r\nCavity regular, acute; Stem medium to long, rather slender.\r\n\r\nFlesh white, tender, juicy; Sour and suitable for cooking. Though\r\nattractive to the eye, it is unsuited for the dessert.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. Jno. A. Kennicott, the pioneer cultivator of Northern Illinois,\r\nthis apple was considered the _ne plus ultra_ for that and higher\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Equinetelee.=\r\n\r\nBACHELOR--BYERS--IOLA (Berckmans' M.S.) SOL. CARTEE (Downing.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 90.--EQUINETELEE.]\r\n\r\nThis fine southern apple has its origin traced to Yancey County, in\r\nNorth Carolina. It has not yet been sufficiently tested in the\r\nNorthern States, but is considered one of the best in the South, and\r\nis looked upon as having great promise in our northern orchards, where\r\nit is somewhat introduced. Berckmans says: \"The finest of the late\r\nfall and winter apples.\"\r\n\r\nThe trees bear a strong resemblance to those of the _Buckingham_.\r\n\r\nFruit large, oblate, sometimes oblique; Surface light yellow, mostly\r\ncovered with bright crimson, obscurely striped; Dots small, white.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, narrow, irregular; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, deep; Stem short.\r\n\r\nFlesh pale yellow, very tender, juicy, melting; Flavor very mild\r\nsub-acid, making it a very superior table fruit, from November to\r\nJanuary in Georgia, according to Berkmans.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Evening Party.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 91.--EVENING PARTY.]\r\n\r\nThis excellent dessert fruit originated in Berks County, Pennsylvania,\r\nand was brought into notice by the late lamented Dr. Brinkle, of\r\nPhiladelphia, in his ad-interim reports, and also in Hoffy's Fruits.\r\nIt has been tested with entire satisfaction by J.D.G. Nelson,\r\nPresident of the Indiana Horticultural Society, who always has\r\nadmirers of the fruit exhibited by him at the winter meetings. This\r\napple takes the place at mid-winter which is occupied in summer by the\r\nEarly Joe, and in autumn by the Jefferies, Dr. Watson and Cooper.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to small, regular, quite flat; Surface smooth, mixed red,\r\nand carmine stripes on waxen-yellow ground; Dots numerous, distinct,\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, regular deep; Eye small, closed; Segments long.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, deep, regular, brown; Stem medium, green, slender.\r\n\r\nCore small, regular, closed, touching the eye; Axis short; Seeds\r\nshort, wide, dark; Flesh light yellow, very fine-grained, tender,\r\njuicy; Flavor sub-acid, aromatic; first quality, or very best, for the\r\ndessert, or the _evening party_, during December and January.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fall Wine.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 92.--FALL WINE.]\r\n\r\nOrigin unknown. A great favorite in the West as a table fruit; little\r\ngrown in the Eastern States, whence it was brought. Downing supposes\r\nthis is because the fruit is there defective. In virgin soil it is\r\nremarkably fair and handsome.\r\n\r\nTree of medium size, rather slender, but healthy, spreading, and\r\nannually productive.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, oblate, handsome; inclined to crack open if left on the\r\ntree till ripe; Surface very smooth, waxen-yellow, almost completely\r\ncovered with bright, and often deep red, upon which it is indistinctly\r\nstriped; Dots minute.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, wide, regular or wavy; eye small, closed; Calyx\r\nreflexed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, uniformly green; Stem long, slender.\r\n\r\nCore medium, regular, closed, meeting the eye; Seeds numerous, angular\r\nor plump; flesh yellow, breaking, tender, fine-grained, juicy; flavor\r\nmild sub-acid, and very aromatic; Quality best, for table and market,\r\nduring September and October or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Garden.=\r\n\r\nGARDEN ROYAL.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 93.--GARDEN.]\r\n\r\nThis fine apple has been received from quite distant points,\r\nChillicothe, Ohio, and Salem, Indiana. It is quite distinct in season\r\nfrom the _Beefsteak_ or _Garden_ of Downing, but in description\r\ncorresponds very closely with the _Garden-Royal_ of Elliott, which\r\nfruit I have not seen.

In\r\naccordance with common acceptance in the regions where it is best\r\nknown, I have adopted the above name, which was given to distinguish\r\nit from several other Vanderveres, and especially from the Newtown\r\nSpitzenberg, to which the name Vandervere had been applied in New\r\nYork and westward on that parallel. Coxe describes the fruit in\r\nquestion under the name _Vandervere_.\r\n\r\nTree vigorous, healthy, large, spreading, very twiggy and drooping,\r\nwith abundant fruit on the ends of the spray; Foliage bright\r\nyellowish-green, shining, pointed, the whole aspect of the tree\r\npeculiar and characteristic in summer or winter.\r\n\r\nFruit medium or less, oblate, or globular-oblate, regular; Surface\r\nsmooth, but having raised hemispherical warts of a yellow russet\r\ncolor, yellow, mottled, and striped light red, often a gray appearance\r\nover the whole exterior; Dots large, yellow, indented.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, regular, not deep; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular; Stem long, slender.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed, meeting and clasping the eye; seeds numerous,\r\npointed, plump; Flesh yellow, breaking, granular, juicy; Flavor highly\r\naromatic, acid; Quality for table third, for kitchen first, for cider\r\nCoxe says very good, yielding a heavy must; Season December and\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is subject to bitter rot, and does not keep well, but may be\r\nused for cooking as soon as any other apple, making good sauce in\r\nJuly, when not half grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pottinger.=\r\n\r\nBIG RED.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 104.--POTTINGER.]\r\n\r\nThis large market fruit is found chiefly in regions settled by\r\nimmigrants from the South, and it may prove to be the same as some\r\nother southern apple.

He exhibited specimens at the Toledo\r\nmeeting of the Ohio Pomological Society in January, 1864, but the\r\nfruit was over ripe; at the State Fair at Dayton, Ohio, October 16th,\r\nit was shown in perfection of beauty and excellence, and was then\r\nexamined by the Society, who commended it highly, and being satisfied\r\nthat it was an original seedling, its local name, _Miller's Apple_,\r\nwas then changed to _Powers_, in honor of the pomologist who had\r\nbrought it into notice.\r\n\r\nThe tree appears to have been an accidental seedling, which sprang up\r\nin the town of Perrysburgh, where it grew almost without care until it\r\nfruited a few years ago, and attracted the attention of Mr. Powers.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is large and fair, round, somewhat flattened, and sometimes\r\nrather conic, generally regular, but large specimens are slightly\r\nangular; the surface is very smooth, a greenish waxen yellow, more or\r\nless shaded with mixed light red, upon which are laid numerous stripes\r\nand broken splashes of rich, dark carmine; Dots minute, scattered,\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, regular, or folded; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, regular, sometimes brown; Stem medium or short.\r\n\r\nCore medium or wide, regular, closed, meeting the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\nplump, sometimes imperfect; Flesh white, very tender, juicy; Flavor\r\nmild sub-acid, quite aromatic, very agreeable; Use especially for the\r\ntable, as a highly ornamental dessert fruit, for which its extreme\r\ndelicacy adapts it, while the same quality unfits it for general\r\nmarket purposes; Quality very good; in its season of ripening, in its\r\nbeautifully white and tender flesh, and in its perfumed flavor, this\r\nfruit resembles the _Fameuse_, from which it may have been produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Prolific Beauty.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 107.--PROLIFIC BEAUTY.]\r\n\r\nThis showy fruit is one of the original Putnam list of Washington\r\nCounty, Ohio; it is somewhat singular that so few choice sorts are\r\ntraceable to the seeds of these first good orchards of the West. Rome\r\nBeauty is almost the only one of great notoriety that is referable to\r\nthis source.\r\n\r\nFruit large, sometimes quite large, oblate, somewhat conic, regular;\r\nSurface smooth, yellowish-green, partially covered with stripes of\r\nred; Dots minute, gray.\r\n\r\nBasin medium, wide, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy, green; Stem medium.\r\n\r\nCore large, regular, open, clasping; Seeds numerous, plump; Flesh\r\nwhitish-yellow, tender, juicy; Flavor acid; quality scarcely good; Use\r\nkitchen, market; Season September to December.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rambo.=\r\n\r\nROMANITE OF NEW JERSEY--BREAD-AND-CHEESE, ETC.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 108.--RAMBO.]\r\n\r\nThis standard Eastern Pennsylvania variety is universally popular, and\r\nthrough the Western States it marks the progress of emigration from\r\nthe Keystone State, though its admirers are not confined to that class\r\nof our population. It is a fall and early winter fruit, and some\r\npomologists on the southern borders of its culture object to it that\r\nit will not keep long, and that it soon becomes dry and mealy when put\r\naway. When grown further north it is smaller, but more solid, and\r\nremains juicy until spring. It should be gathered early, even before\r\nit is well colored, and kept cool to make it retain its flavor and\r\njuiciness.\r\n\r\nTree upright, very thrifty, very productive; shoots dark, foliage\r\nlarge, light green, and thus the variety may easily be distinguished\r\nin the orchard. Not very hardy; whole nurseries and orchards were\r\ndestroyed, in 1856, throughout the Northwest.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to small, when crowded upon the limbs as they generally\r\nare upon old trees, regular, oblate, or roundish-oblate, but sometimes\r\nunequal when overgrown; large specimens are flattened at the ends so\r\nas to appear truncate; Surface striped and splashed scarlet on\r\ngreenish-yellow, in some the stripes coalesce so as to make the skin\r\nred, the ground color being covered; Dots numerous, small, prominent,\r\nrich bloom.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, abrupt, regular or plaited, sometimes quite shallow; Eye\r\nsmall, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, always green; Stem medium.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed, meeting and clasping the eye; seeds numerous,\r\nlarge, angular; Flesh greenish-white, tender, breaking, granular,\r\njuicy; Flavor sub-acid, aromatic, vinous; Quality almost first rate\r\nfor table, excellent for the kitchen; Season October to December, and\r\nif gathered early in the North, until spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Red Astrachan.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 109.--RED ASTRACHAN.]\r\n\r\nThis Russian fruit has been perfectly adopted by our countrymen, and\r\nhas proved itself a great favorite, particularly in the North, by its\r\nhardiness and productiveness, beauty and good qualities.\r\n\r\nTree vigorous, upright, productive, hardy; Shoots reddish brown,\r\nfoliage large, rich green.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, regular, oblate; Surface smooth, mottled,\r\nmarbled and striped crimson on greenish-yellow; Dots minute, heavy\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\nBasin medium, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity shallow, regular; Stem long, yellow.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed; Seeds angular, small, dark; Flesh yellow,\r\nbreaking, juicy; Flavor quite acid, not rich; Quality first rate for\r\nmarket and cooking, poor for table; Season July.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Richard's Graft.=\r\n\r\nRED SPITZENBERG--STRAWBERRY--WINE.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 110.--RICHARD'S GRAFT.]\r\n\r\nSupposed to have originated in Ulster County, New York.

It was introduced at\r\nthe meeting of the American Pomological Society in 1862, by T.T. Lyon,\r\nof Plymouth, Mich., who stated that it was a seedling of the Fameuse,\r\nthe faults of which it does not inherit, though possessing all the\r\ngood qualities of its parent, with a healthy and productive tree. (See\r\nMichigan Farmer, Dec. 11, 1859.)\r\n\r\nFruit medium, very handsome, very regular, quite flat; Surface very\r\nsmooth, pale yellow, mixed and distinctly striped carmine; Dots\r\nscattered, minute.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, folded; Eye medium, closed; Calyx reflexed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore wide, regular, somewhat open, meeting the eye; seeds plump,\r\nshort, dark; Flesh very white, fine-grained, tender, breaking; Flavor\r\nsub-acid, aromatic; Quality good to very good; Use dessert and market;\r\nSeason October to January.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Summer Limbertwig.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 113.--SUMMER LIMBERTWIG.]\r\n\r\nSouthern; obtained from S.

Hocking of the\r\nWest may prove to be the same.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trader's Fancy.=\r\n\r\nThis peculiar looking apple originated in Washington County,\r\nPennsylvania. Tree vigorous, healthy, spreading, round-headed, very\r\nproductive, bears regularly. As a long keeper, with dark skin, that\r\ndoes not show bruises, it became a favorite with shippers on the Ohio\r\nriver, hence its name, the flat-boats that stop from port to port to\r\ndispose of their cargoes being called trading boats, and their masters\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, regular, oblate; Surface very smooth, greenish yellow,\r\nalmost completely obscured with deep purple red, mixed and striped,\r\nand covered with a white bloom.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, sometimes folded or plaited; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular; Stem medium, slender.\r\n\r\nCore medium, closed; Seeds plump; Flesh whitish, tender, fine-grained;\r\nFlavor mild sub-acid; Quality only good; Use market and kitchen;\r\nSeason January to May.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Twenty-Ounce Pippin.=\r\n\r\nOrigin unknown, and the variety never should have been distributed; it\r\nis here named to put people on their guard against it when they desire\r\nto purchase the _Cayuga Red Streak_, also called the _Twenty-ounce\r\napple_.\r\n\r\nFruit large, flat, regular; Surface greenish, more or less mottled and\r\nstriped dull red.\r\n\r\nBasin, wide, regular, or wavy; Eye small, open.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, green; Stem short, thick.\r\n\r\nCore large, closed; Seeds numerous, angular; Flesh yellow-white,\r\nbreaking; Flavor acid, with a peculiar aroma, not agreeable; Quality\r\npoor; Use kitchen only; Season November to January.

I have taken the name by which it\r\nis almost universally recognized by cultivators, though it is adopted\r\nonly as a synonym by Mr. Elliott, who seems to have confounded this\r\napple with the _Pennsylvania Vandervere_ or _Staalcubs_ described by\r\nCoxe.\r\n\r\nOrigin believed to have been Pennsylvania, but this is not well\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nTree very vigorous, large, spreading, productive, bearing annually;\r\nTwigs and leaves much like the Pennsylvania Vandervere.\r\n\r\nFruit large to very large, regular, oblate; surface smooth, yellow,\r\nmore or less covered with marbled red, and scarlet stripes; Dots\r\nlarge, yellow, indented, sometimes irregularly net-veined, making it\r\nless smooth.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, regular; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular; Stem long, medium size.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed, meeting and clasping the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\ndark; Flesh yellow, firm, breaking, granular, juicy, heavy; Flavor\r\nrich, acid; Quality poor for table, excellent for cooking; Season\r\nDecember. Does not keep well, rather subject to bitter rot, but a\r\ngreat favorite with house-keepers, and a useful shade tree near the\r\nkitchen door.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vaughan's Winter.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 114.--VAUGHAN'S WINTER.]\r\n\r\nThis Kentucky variety was sent to me by my friend J.S.

It was at one time thought to\r\nbe the Cooper.\r\n\r\nMr. W.F. English, of Auglaize County, Ohio, carried grafts into that\r\nregion from Pickaway County, and in a most disinterested manner\r\nexerted himself to distribute the variety. In a communication to the\r\n_Western Horticultural Review_, for February, 1853, he says: \"The tree\r\nis vigorous, leaves upon young shoots are often three to three and a\r\nhalf inches broad, and four or five, and even six inches long; shoots\r\nstout, being often as large as your little finger at the end of the\r\nsummer's growth. The form of the tree is peculiar, and its appearance\r\nbeautiful; once seen, it may be recognized anywhere by its habit.\"\r\n\r\nHaving fruited this variety in my own orchard, I can confirm the\r\nabove, and add:\r\n\r\nTree vigorous, large, spreading, open head, productive, an early\r\nbearer.\r\n\r\nFruit large, sometimes very large, beautiful, regular, oblate, not\r\ndisposed to rot, except when attacked by the birds, which are very\r\nfond of it; Surface smooth, pale yellow, partially covered with mixed\r\nred, striped and often distinctly splashed with bright red; Dots\r\nnumerous, gray, prominent; Skin quite thin.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, regular, sometimes cracked open; Eye large, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular, green, and partly brown; Stem either short or\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nCore large, nearly closed, clasping the eye; Seeds numerous, medium,\r\npointed; Flesh light yellow, almost white, brittle, tender, juicy,\r\nalmost melting, never water-cored; Flavor sub-acid, vinous, delicious,\r\nsatisfying; Quality best; either for table or cooking, for the latter\r\npurpose they may be taken when half grown in the beginning of July. In\r\nAugust they may be house-ripened and found good, but the proper season\r\nis September to Christmas; if properly cared for they may be preserved\r\nplump until March, but lose some of their refreshing flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wilson.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 116.--WILSON.]\r\n\r\nThis very nice little apple was sent to me with this name from Western\r\nVirginia, by Julius Brace, who found it abundant on Paint Creek. I\r\nhave not yet been able to identify it, but it may prove to be the same\r\nas some of our new southern varieties. An outline and description are\r\nhere given with its local name, in the hope that if it should prove to\r\nbe the same as the _Black Annette_, of the Clinch river region of\r\nVirginia, or some other variety, the identity may be the more readily\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\nFruit small, regular, oblate, or globular-oblate; Surface smooth,\r\nnearly covered with very deep red, in which the stripes are almost\r\nobscured; Dots numerous, minute, white.\r\n\r\nBasin, deep, regular, plaited or folded; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity regular, acute; Stem long, red.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed, meeting, not clasping the eye; Seeds small,\r\nplump; Flesh white, fine-grained, crisp, tender, juicy; Flavor mild\r\nsub-acid, agreeable; Quality best; Use table; Season January.\r\n\r\nThis is different from Wilson's of Michigan, which is yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wine.=--[_Coxe._]\r\n\r\nHAYS' WINTER--PENNSYLVANIA RED STREAK.\r\n\r\nThis handsome large apple is another index of the source of population\r\nin a western county.

The late Dr.\r\nBarker, one of the most intelligent fruit-growers of the country, said\r\nit was introduced as a seedling from Kentucky in 1812. Elliott does\r\nnot mention it in his work, but in the discussions of the Society he\r\nis reported as having declared it the same as Early Harvest, with\r\nwhich it agrees in peculiar growth of twigs. H.N. Gillett, and others,\r\nfamiliar with the fruits of southern Ohio, consider it a distinct\r\nseedling of Kentucky. The specimen described was from that gentleman.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, oblate, somewhat conical, irregular and angular; Surface\r\nsmooth, pale yellow; Dots scattered, dark.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, medium, folded; Eye small, closed.

I have omitted the synonyms, as they can\r\nbe of little interest to our planters; they are not used in this\r\ncountry.

Another focus of distribution was the\r\norchard and nursery of R.W. Todd, at Madison, Indiana, and the fruit\r\nhas been received under the name of Shannon, from Doctor J.A.

It was brought to the West by different\r\nroutes--by the Ohio River and by the lakes--and has been universally\r\ndistributed. Those brought to the mouth of the Muskingum River, and\r\npropagated by Mr. Putnam, had the name changed to that of the Marietta\r\nand the Putnam Russet; and at the same time the appearance of the\r\nfruit was so altered by increase in the russeting, that it was long\r\nthought to be a different variety, until the question was at length\r\nsettled by interchange of grafts; and when these fruited the identity\r\nwas proved.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that more money has been realized from this than from\r\nany other variety, though, on the Ohio River, the Rome Beauty is\r\nconsidered to be equally profitable. The popularity of this Russet is\r\non the wane, however, as it is very subject to attacks of the\r\nCodling-moth, which makes it fall, and because it is apt to ripen too\r\nearly in the season in southern locations and on limestone soils.\r\nHence its value as a keeping apple is diminished.\r\n\r\nTree robust, vigorous, spreading; Shoots stout, straggling, dark;\r\nFoliage gray-green.\r\n\r\nFruit large, oblate, often lop-sided at the West, frequently angular,\r\nsometimes conic and truncated; Surface overspread with heavy brown\r\nrusset in the South, but green, often bronzed, and with partial light\r\nrusset at the north of latitude 41°; Dots minute, scattered.\r\n\r\nBasin regular or wavy, green, often folded; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity regular, pointed; Stem medium, curved.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed, clasping; Seeds numerous, angular, imperfect;\r\nFlesh greenish-yellow, breaking, granular, often coarse, juicy; Flavor\r\ndecidedly acid; Quality second rate; Use, market and cooking; Season,\r\nNovember to January; a better keeper in the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Whitney Russet.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 136.--WHITNEY RUSSET.]\r\n\r\nOf uncertain or accidental origin in the extensive nurseries and\r\norchards of my friend A.R.

Considerably\r\ncultivated in the neighborhood, where it is highly esteemed.\r\nIntroduced into Ohio by Mr. John Ludlow, of Springfield, in 1854, and\r\npropagated at the Oakland Nurseries near by.\r\n\r\nTree thrifty and productive.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, conical or oblate-conic, regular; Surface\r\nrather smooth, green to pale greenish-yellow; Dots small, irregular,\r\nrather abundant, gray, somewhat prominent.\r\n\r\nBasin shallow, nearly regular, russeted, like Rhode Island Greening;\r\nEye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, sometimes lipped, wavy; Stem long, slender.\r\n\r\nCore small, oval, regular, closed, just meeting the eye; Seeds small,\r\nvery light colored; Flesh greenish-yellow, breaking, fine grained,\r\ntender, juicy; Flavor sub-acid, rich, aromatic; Quality nearly first\r\nrate; Use dessert; Season December and January, but is said to keep\r\nuntil May in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n=White Winter Pearmain.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 150.--WHITE WINTER PEARMAIN.]\r\n\r\nThis favorite fruit was brought to Indiana by some of the early\r\npomologists, in the days of saddle-bag transportation. In a lot of\r\ngrafts, two varieties, having lost their labels, were propagated and\r\nfruited without name. Being considered Pearmain-shaped, they were\r\ncalled respectively Red and White Winter Pearmains. The former proved\r\nto be the Esopus Spitzenberg; the latter has never yet been\r\nidentified, though believed to be an old eastern variety. Mr. Downing\r\nsuggests that it may be _Winter Harvey_, a description of which I\r\nhave not seen. At one time this apple was confounded with the _Michael\r\nHenry_ by many of us, and Mr. Elliott gives it as a synonym of that\r\nvariety, but they are very distinct.\r\n\r\nTree spreading, vigorous, productive, the bark often marked by a kind\r\nof canker or crack. Foliage large, rather light green.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, handsome when fair, but often scabby on rich\r\nlimestone soils and on old trees, conical, regular, sometimes\r\nobscurely angular; Surface smooth, yellow, often bronzy; Dots\r\nscattered, small, dark.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, regular or shallow and folded; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, wavy, brown; Stem medium to long, often knobby and\r\nclubbed.\r\n\r\nCore regular, closed, slightly clasping the eye; Seeds few, pointed,\r\npale or yellow; Flesh yellow, fine grained, tender, crisp, juicy;\r\nFlavor mild sub-acid, very rich; Quality best; Uses table, kitchen,\r\nmarket; Season December to March.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Woolfolks.=\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to be a Kentucky seedling.

It was first presented to the\r\nAmerican Society at the Philadelphia meeting, in 1860, when it was\r\nfigured and reported on by the Committee on Native Fruits, to some of\r\nwhom, as to thousands of others in the West, it was familiar as\r\nhousehold words. This fruit was brought by settlers to Southern\r\nIllinois, and thence distributed, by taking up the sprouts that formed\r\nabout the base of the stocks, and setting them out for an orchard. I\r\nhave some of these growing, and they make nice plants.\r\n\r\nTree vigorous, upright, compact while young, spreading with the weight\r\nof fruit, never large; the shoots rather slender, red, dark; Leaves\r\nmedium, rather narrow, wider towards the end, dark, footstalks red.\r\nThe stems of these trees are characterized by curious enlargements of\r\nan irregular, mammellar form, and reddish color, and appear to be like\r\nthe knaurs of the olive tree.\r\n\r\nWhen this apple was first brought to the notice of the Cincinnati\r\nHorticultural Society, twenty years ago, it was thought to resemble\r\nthe Winter Queen of Kentucky so closely that it was considered only a\r\nvariety or sport, and called the _Striped Fall Queen_, but it has\r\nsince been deemed a distinct sort.\r\n\r\nFruit large to very large, variable in form, but generally conical, or\r\noblate-conic, truncated, angular; Surface smooth, greenish-yellow,\r\nmixed and striped pale purplish-red; Dots scattered, prominent,\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, abrupt, wavy; Eye large, long, open.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy, brown; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore large, regular, closed; Axis very short; Seeds numerous, long,\r\npointed; Flesh yellow, tender, fine-grained, juicy; Flavor mild\r\nsub-acid, rich, agreeable; Quality best, or nearly so; Use, table,\r\nkitchen, drying; Season, October to December.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Esopus Spitzenberg.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 173.--ESOPUS SPITZENBERG.]\r\n\r\nOrigin New York, on the Hudson. This fruit has changed its character\r\nin progressing westward and southward, becoming larger and more\r\nirregular, less brilliantly colored, less highly flavored, and less\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nTree vigorous, upright, thrifty, but in some regions subject to blight\r\nand unprofitable; Shoots slender.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, conical, ribbed, irregular; Surface smooth,\r\nyellow, covered with bright red, marbled and mixed, striped more or\r\nless distinctly; Dots numerous, large, irregular, gray, always\r\nelongated near the base.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, ribbed or folded, often leather-cracked; Eye small,\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, acute, regular, or wavy; Stem long.\r\n\r\nCore large, closed; Seeds long, pointed; Flesh rich, yellow, breaking,\r\njuicy at the North, more fibrous than crisp at the South; Flavor quite\r\nacid till ripe, when it is rich, saccharine, highly aromatic, giving\r\nthe idea of the Spitzenberg flavor; Quality best; Use, dessert and\r\nkitchen; Season, December to February.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lansingburgh.=\r\n\r\nThe origin of this long-keeper has not been traced. It has been common\r\nabout Cincinnati, and along the Ohio River, for many years.\r\n\r\nTree upright, vigorous, brushy and thorny, looking like a wilding.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, conical, angular, oblique, often unequal; Surface\r\nsmooth, green and yellow, bronzed and blushed, becoming very rich\r\nyellow and carmine--an indistinct gray-striping makes the ripe fruit\r\nappear to be striped yellow; Dots minute, indented, gray, with green\r\nbases.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, plaited or folded; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, irregular, rough with brown; Stem short.\r\n\r\nCore small, oval, closed; Seeds numerous, large; Flesh firm, compact;\r\nFlavor mild sub-acid, negative; Quality scarcely good; Use, market,\r\nornamental, cooking; Season in the kitchen all winter--ornamental and\r\neatable March to May, or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Late Strawberry.=\r\n\r\nAUTUMN STRAWBERRY.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this choice fruit appears to be unknown.\r\n\r\nTree upright, productive, thrifty, leaves serrate.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, roundish, conical, angular, furrowed; Surface smooth,\r\nwaxen-yellow, mixed and striped scarlet; Dots minute, indented.\r\n\r\nBasin folded, irregular; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, wavy, irregular; Stem slender, long.\r\n\r\nCore medium, regular, closed, Seeds large; Flesh yellow, very tender,\r\nfine-grained, very juicy; Flavor sub-acid, aromatic, refreshing,\r\nvinous; Quality best; Use, dessert especially; Season, August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThere is another similar fruit--the _Frank_ or _Chenango Strawberry_,\r\nwhich is by some preferred to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Northern Spy.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 174.--NORTHERN SPY.]\r\n\r\nOrigin near Rochester, New York. Tree very vigorous, large, upright,\r\nspreading, when older; shoots reddish, leaves healthy, large, dark.\r\nTree productive when old, but not an early bearer; needs trimming to\r\nadmit light and air to the fruit.\r\n\r\nFruit large, flattened-conical, angular; Surface smooth, yellow,\r\nmixed, and splashed, scarlet, or crimson; Dots scattered, small.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, regular, or folded; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, regular or wavy, brown; Stem medium to short.\r\n\r\nCore large, irregular, open; Seeds numerous, small, pointed, pale;\r\nFlesh yellowish-white, breaking, granular, juicy; Flavor acid,\r\nbecoming sub-acid, aromatic, rich, with the spiciness of a\r\nSpitzenberg; Quality considered best, but rather coarse in texture;\r\nUse, table, kitchen and market; Season, December until May, and in the\r\nNorth longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Red Canada.=\r\n\r\nSTEEL'S RED.\r\n\r\nOrigin New England.

It\r\nwas introduced at Fort Wayne by Mr. Rockhill, who is reported to have\r\n\"made more money from the trees of this variety than from twice as\r\nmany of any other early apple.\" Recommended for general cultivation in\r\nthat State.\r\n\r\nTree hardy in nursery and orchard, productive; Shoots very downy.\r\n\r\nFruit medium to small, long, conical, furrowed or ribbed; Surface\r\npolished, pale yellow, mixed and splashed crimson.\r\n\r\nBasin very shallow, plaited; Eye very small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, regular, browned; Stem medium.\r\n\r\nCore long, oval, embracing the eye; Flesh whitish, tender,\r\nfine-grained, juicy; Flavor acid; Quality good; Table or kitchen;\r\nSeason, July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scalloped Gilliflower.=\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to be an old European variety. Its peculiarly\r\nirregular form makes it quite a remarkable fruit. It is sometimes\r\ncalled _Red Gilliflower_; but that name is also very commonly applied\r\nto quite another fruit--the _Red Winter Pearmain_, described on a\r\nprevious page, in Class II., Order I., Section 2., Sub-section 2.\r\n\r\nFruit large, round-conic, very irregular, furrowed and ribbed; Surface\r\nyellow, marbled and splashed scarlet.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, deep, folded or ribbed; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, acute, irregular, wavy; Stem medium.\r\n\r\nCore regular, round, very open, meeting the eye; Seeds numerous,\r\nplump; Flesh yellow, breaking, tender; Flavor sub-acid, aromatic;\r\nQuality scarcely good; Use, table, kitchen; Season, November,\r\nDecember. Chiefly grown northward.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Seager.=\r\n\r\nThis large, handsome fruit was exhibited at the American Pomological\r\nSociety's meeting at Philadelphia, in 1860, by Chas. P. Davis, of\r\nPhillipsburgh, New Jersey.

Hodge, of Buffalo, and\r\nbrought to the notice of his western friends by Hon. M.L. Dunlap, of\r\nChampaign, Illinois, who esteems it very highly. I quote from his\r\naccount of it:\r\n\r\n\"This proves one of our most profitable winter apples; the tree bears\r\nyoung and constantly, but fuller on alternate years; fruit large and\r\nshowy, shoots large and downy; buds prominent, fruit buds large, and\r\nthe earliest in the orchard to swell; but they do not open as soon as\r\nothers.

Keeps sound until May--bruises do not\r\nrot as in other apples. Valuable also for stock.\r\n\r\nIts early bearing makes it very desirable in a new country, and in the\r\nprairies it has received the soubriquet of \"_Dollars and Cents_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hall.=\r\n\r\nHALL'S SEEDLING--HALL'S RED.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 190.--HALL.]\r\n\r\nFrom Franklin County, North Carolina, and now being spread throughout\r\nthe Western States as a fruit of great promise.\r\n\r\nTree medium size, sufficiently thrifty, upright, hardy, very\r\nproductive; Shoots long, rather slender, reddish, wood firm.\r\nIntroduced into the West by the venerable R.

The stalk is of the ordinary length, inserted in a cavity of\r\nmedium depth; the crown is moderately deep. The time of ripening is\r\nabout the first of October, after which the fruit soon falls and is\r\nfit for cider. It does not keep long, but while in season is a\r\ndelicious table apple.

It is\r\nessentially a fruit for the amateur; being of slender and slow growth\r\nin the nursery, it is not a favorite with the propagators, and though\r\nmaking a large and productive tree in the orchard, it is not\r\nprofitable as a market variety.\r\n\r\nFruit medium, variable in form, being oblong, round, conic and even\r\noblate, regular or unequal; Surface smooth, greenish yellow, more or\r\nless covered with dull purplish red, marbled, and made up of very\r\nshort splashes, with distinct stripes and splashes of brighter red;\r\nDots minute.\r\n\r\nBasin medium, regular; Eye rather large, nearly closed; Segments\r\nrecurved.\r\n\r\nCavity rather deep, acute, regular; Stem medium to long.\r\n\r\nCore small, roundish, closed; Seeds small, pointed; Flesh yellow,\r\nexceedingly tender, almost melting, crisp, fine-grained, juicy; Flavor\r\nvery mild sub-acid, aromatic, deliciously refreshing; Quality best;\r\nUse, the dessert; Season, August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Baccalinus.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 208.--BACCALINUS.]\r\n\r\nFruited by J.H.

It was long cultivated by Verry\r\nAldrich, in Bureau County, Illinois, and exhibited as _New York\r\nPippin_, which name gave an idea of its eastern origin, but in other\r\nlocalities its relations point clearly to its source in the South. To\r\nMr. J.S. Downer we are indebted for a knowledge of its present name,\r\nand for confirmation of its identity under its several synonyms. This\r\napple may be said to have succeeded as well in the northern parts of\r\nIndiana and Illinois as in their southern borders, where it has long\r\nbeen planted; though the northern orchards are still young, they are\r\nvery promising. The fruit is modified somewhat by a cooler climate,\r\nand will keep later than that grown in the South.\r\n\r\nTree remarkably healthy and vigorous, an upright, rapid grower in the\r\nnursery, and has numerous short spur-branches along the stem. In the\r\norchard the limbs are set very strongly, and the stems are marked by\r\nlittle mammillar projections or knobs, that are very characteristic.\r\nTree large, spreading, productive, bears early; Shoots long, reddish\r\nbrown, smooth; Foliage large, dark green.\r\n\r\nFruit large, variable in form, round, often apparently oblong,\r\ntapering to the eye, truncated, regular, sometimes inclined, generally\r\nvery true, as though turned in a lathe; Surface smooth, often\r\npolished, yellow covered with mixed red, splashed bright red; Dots\r\nminute, scattered.\r\n\r\nBasin generally shallow, in large developed specimens deep, abrupt,\r\nalways regular; Eye large, open; Segments reflexed.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, acute, wavy, brown; Stem medium to long.\r\n\r\nCore medium, regular, clasping the eye; Seeds large, plump; Flesh\r\nwhitish, breaking, tender, juicy; Flavor sub-acid, not rich; Quality\r\nonly good; Use, market, kitchen; Season, December, January and longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blackburn.=\r\n\r\nFound in the markets at Louisville, Kentucky; not much seen elsewhere.\r\nOrigin unknown, probably Southern.\r\n\r\nFruit large, round, somewhat flattened; Surface dull looking, dull\r\ngreen and gray, with broken stripes of dark dull red; Dots large, gray\r\nabout the apex.\r\n\r\nBasin narrow, regular; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity rather deep, acute, brown; Stem medium, curved, rather stout.\r\n\r\nCore flattened, open, clasping; Flesh white, crisp, juicy; Flavor\r\nsub-acid, with a peculiar spicy, wild, rather astringent taste, that\r\ndiminishes with the maturity of the fruit; Quality considered good;\r\nUse, family and market; Season September, November. _Blackburn_ is\r\nsometimes used as a synonym of _Fall Queen_, a different fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Capital.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 210.--CAPITAL.]\r\n\r\nA seedling of Z.S.

Also\r\nuseful for cooking, except on account of its small size; the rich and\r\npiquant acid makes it a particularly desirable ingredient in\r\nmince-pies.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky there is a variety of this apple known as _Beeler's Crab_,\r\nwith fruit of similar characters, but the tree is a better grower.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hubbardston.=\r\n\r\nHUBBARDSTON NONSUCH.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 221.--HUBBARDSTON.]\r\n\r\nThis fine apple originated in Hubbardston, Massachusetts.

In all places it seems to be doing well, and giving entire\r\nsatisfaction, excepting that the bark bursts near the ground even in\r\nbearing trees, root-grafted.\r\n\r\nTree vigorous, thrifty, spreading, productive; Shoots rather slender,\r\ndark; Foliage dark green, abundant on young trees.\r\n\r\nFruit large, round, flattened, regular, fair, handsome, though not so\r\nbeautifully colored as some others; Surface smooth, mixed, splashed\r\nand striped, pale purplish red on yellow, which shows through the\r\nshading; Dots minute, indented, gray, so that the fruit has a general\r\ngray appearance.\r\n\r\nBasin medium, regular, sometimes cracked; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, wavy, rather deep, brown; Stem short, medium, or rather\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nCore roundish, medium, regular, open; Seeds numerous, large, angular,\r\nsome imperfect; Flesh yellow, breaking, somewhat coarse-grained,\r\njuicy; Flavor sub-acid; Quality quite good; Use, market, kitchen,\r\ntable; Season, December to February.\r\n\r\nIn the West it is more flattened than in Ohio, becoming in large\r\nspecimens almost a flat or oblate apple. Highly recommended for\r\ncommercial orchards, whether for shipping North or South--particularly\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lewis.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 223.--LEWIS.]\r\n\r\nThis delicious apple originated in Decatur County, Indiana, near\r\nGreensburgh, and was introduced to my notice by one of the early\r\npomologists of the region, a nurseryman by the name of Lewis, from\r\nwhom I obtained my trees after he had introduced me to the original,\r\nwhich I found to be vigorous, healthy, upright, spreading and\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nThe fruit was described in the _Western Horticultural Review_ for\r\n1852, before I was aware that my friend Reuben Ragan had an apple of\r\nthe same name; nevertheless, this, by priority of publication, will\r\nstand, unless there should prove to be another Lewis that can claim\r\nseniority of publication. I distinguish the other apple by calling it\r\nLewis of Ragan; it is in another class.--[See Downing, p. 164.]\r\n\r\nFruit medium to large, round, somewhat ovate, regular; Surface smooth,\r\nyellow, striped and marbled scarlet; Dots scattered, gray and yellow.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, abrupt, regular; Eye medium, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, deep, regular; Stem long, slender.\r\n\r\nCore regular, oval, heart-shaped, closed, meeting the eye; Seeds\r\nnumerous, plump, brown; Flesh yellow, very tender, crisp, juicy;\r\nFlavor acid to sub-acid, rich, delicious; Quality best; Use, table\r\nand kitchen; Season, August.

The fruit is singularly affected by change of soil\r\nand climate; thus, on the Ohio River, it is seen quite flat and\r\nregular, with a dull green russeted skin, becoming yellow and ruddy;\r\nin one part of the State of Indiana, on limestone, it is gibbous,\r\nround, often very large, and covered with a rich cinnamon russet,\r\nwhile on the coal measures, west of the center of the State, it is\r\nsmaller, regular, and distinctly striped deep red on red, with very\r\nlittle russet. Specimens from Rochester, New York, have been shown\r\nwith scarcely a trace of russet, and having the stripes as distinct\r\nand almost as beautiful as those of a _Duchess of Oldenburgh_, so that\r\nno southern or western man would have recognized it for his home\r\nfavorite.

There is, however, a remarkable diversity in the\r\nfruit arising from the different soils and climates in which it is\r\ncultivated, North and South, and while, like many other varieties, its\r\nsize is greatly developed, its texture and flavor are depreciated in\r\nthe migrations southward.\r\n\r\nFruit large, flattened, globular, somewhat angular, or flattened,\r\nsometimes having a shallow sulcus or furrow on one side; Surface\r\nsmooth, yellow or orange, being sometimes faintly blushed; Dots gray,\r\nwith white bases.\r\n\r\nBasin rather shallow and folded; Eye small and open, calycinal\r\nsegments being short.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, but often lipped, brown; Stem short, very thick, clubbed\r\nor knobby.\r\n\r\nCore large, closed, clasping the eye; Seeds numerous, angular; Flesh\r\nyellow, tender, breaking, fine-grained; Flavor sub-acid and somewhat\r\naromatic; of first quality in the North; Use, table, kitchen or\r\nmarket; Season, December to January, or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Primate.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 253.--PRIMATE.]\r\n\r\nThis delicious table apple has strong claims upon our admiration, on\r\naccount of its good qualities as a dessert fruit, for the extreme\r\ndelicacy of its skin and flesh render it unfit for market; it is\r\ntherefore not profitable for the commercial orchard.\r\n\r\nTree thrifty, stocky, vigorous, strongly branched, productive; Shoots\r\nstout, short, light olive; Buds prominent, foliage pale green.\r\n\r\nFruit full medium, globular, angular, irregular; Surface smooth,\r\ngreenish-yellow, becoming almost white, sometimes faintly blushed;\r\nDots minute.\r\n\r\nBasin abrupt, folded; Eye small but long, closed; Segments reflexed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, wavy, green; Stem medium to long, thick.\r\n\r\nCore medium, round, closed, clasping; Seeds numerous, angular, long,\r\ndark; Flesh greenish-white, very tender, fine-grained; Flavor mild\r\nsub-acid, very agreeable; Quality best; Use, the dessert; Season, July\r\nand August.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Progress.=\r\n\r\nNot having had the good fortune to study this apple, I quote the\r\ndescription given by Downing:\r\n\r\n\"A native of Middletown, Connecticut.

Not very\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=White Pippin.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 257.--WHITE PIPPIN.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of this valuable fruit is entirely unknown, and its history\r\ncan only be traced to the nursery of Silas Wharton, who may have\r\nbrought it with him from the East. For a time some of our leading\r\npomologists thought it was the _Canada Reinette_, but this idea has\r\nlong since been relinquished, and all agree that it is _sui generis_,\r\nthough it may have had a different name. In some of its external\r\ncharacters it more nearly resembles the _Yellow Newtown Pippin_ than\r\nany other fruit; but, while it lacks the high, spicy flavor of that\r\napple, it is found to be much more profitable in the orchard.\r\n\r\nThe tree is remarkably thrifty, vigorous and productive, upright, with\r\nvery dark shoots, covered with down, bearing large leaves that are\r\nquite downy beneath, and deep green above.\r\n\r\nFruit large, variable in form, angular, sometimes lop-sided, generally\r\nfair, free from scab; Surface smooth, green or greenish-white to very\r\npale yellow when ripe; the skin toward the base is often marked on the\r\nunripe apple with indistinct wavy stripes of white, the interspaces\r\nare sometimes colored by exposure, and assume a pink or purplish hue,\r\nmaking the fruit appear to be striped; Dots very minute, and\r\nsurrounded by green bases that are most distinct before the fruit is\r\nperfectly ripe; these and the white stripes are very characteristic.\r\n\r\nBasin deep, abrupt, regular, wavy or folded; Eye small, closed.\r\n\r\nCavity wide, deep, wavy, brown and green: Stem short, sometimes thick.\r\n\r\nCore small, pyriform, closed, clasping; Seeds numerous, angular, pale\r\nbrown, pointed; Flesh white or yellowish-white, breaking, granular,\r\njuicy; Flavor acid to sub-acid, not spicy; Quality good; Use, kitchen\r\nrather than table, cooks very well; Season, December and January; not\r\na very good keeper; may be preserved until March.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yellow Newtown.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 258.--YELLOW NEWTOWN.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of this variety of the Newtown Pippin, which has obtained\r\nsuch a world-wide notoriety as the \"American Apple,\" is very\r\nuncertain. The distinction between this and the _Green Newtown_, as\r\ndescribed under Class III, I, 2, 1, was well known to Coxe.\r\n\r\nTree resembling that of the Green variety, slow grower in the nursery,\r\nhaving rough bark when old, not an early bearer, but large, spreading,\r\nand productive, and in suitable soils profitable. From some cause,\r\nhowever, the orchards of both these apples are much less satisfactory\r\nin their results than formerly in many parts of the country. Still it\r\nis often seen in great perfection, and I am compiling this description\r\nfrom outlines and notes of a large number that were very fine.\r\n\r\nFruit large, round, more or less modified by being cylindrical,\r\ntruncated, lop-sided, ribbed, and irregular, sometimes even conic;\r\nSurface smooth, yellowish-green, sometimes bronzy, becoming yellow\r\nwhen ripe, like the _White Pippin_, it is marked with gray striæ near\r\nthe base while green; Dots minute, scattered, whitish bases.\r\n\r\nBasin large, folded, ribbed or plaited; Eye medium, rather open.\r\n\r\nCavity deep, acute; brown; Stem medium or short, rarely long.\r\n\r\nCore medium, oval, regular, closed, meeting or clasping the eye; Seeds\r\npointed, brown, sometimes imperfect; Flesh yellow, firm, breaking,\r\njuicy, not crisp like the Green variety; Flavor acid, aromatic, rich,\r\nvery agreeable; Quality best; Use, table, kitchen, market and cider;\r\nSeason, March.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--ROUND APPLES.\r\n\r\n+ORDER II.--IRREGULAR.+\r\n\r\nSECTION 2.--SOUR.\r\n\r\nSUB-SECTION 2.--STRIPED.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Benoni.=\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 259.--BENONI.]\r\n\r\nThis handsome and delicious early apple is a native of Dedham,\r\nMassachusetts. Its good qualities have caused its culture to be widely\r\nextended, and it appears to give very general satisfaction; though not\r\nso early as some other kinds, for the dessert especially, it is\r\nindispensable to the amateur.\r\n\r\nTree small, upright, close, productive, early bearer; Shoots slender,\r\nbrown, leaves thin, long.\r\n\r\nFruit small to medium, round, truncated, somewhat angular, irregular;\r\nSurface smooth, yellow, covered mixed red, striped scarlet and\r\ncarmine; Dots minute.\r\n\r\nBasin wide, abrupt; Eye large, open or closed.\r\n\r\nCavity acute, wavy, brown; Stem medium, green, often stout.\r\n\r\nCore small, closed, meeting the eye; Seeds angular, dark; Flesh\r\nyellow, fine-grained, juicy; Flavor rich, sub-acid, spicy; Quality\r\nbest; Use, dessert, kitchen and market; Season, July and August.\r\nDelicious and profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Brennaman.=\r\n\r\nThis fine apple, from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, was reported on\r\nby the _ad interim_ Committee of the Pennsylvania Horticultural\r\nSociety, and was brought to my notice by Dr. J.K.

Nobody speaks about this\r\napple, nor writes about it, and yet it is everywhere to be found. This\r\ncannot be the _Black Apple_ of Coxe and Downing, being quite different\r\nin some of its strong characters.

REFERENCE TO THE LISTS OF THE AMERICAN\r\n    POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY AND TO THOSE OF LOCAL SOCIETIES. PRESENT A\r\n    FEW SELECTED LISTS. THE QUESTION OF HARDINESS IS OF GREAT\r\n    INTEREST. LISTS OF HARDY AND TENDER VARIETIES. LISTS FOR CIDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery orchard planter who examines the extended variety of fruits\r\npresented to him in the books, and by the nurserymen, must feel\r\ngreatly embarrassed when he comes to select the varieties for his own\r\norchards. Almost every one of the long lists is recommended for some\r\ngood quality, and the number of _best_, which he is apt to conclude\r\nmeans indispensable for him, is wonderfully large. Some persons are\r\nbewildered by the array presented in the catalogue, and fall back upon\r\ntheir own slender stock of information, selecting only one well known\r\nvariety; but most persons commit a far greater fault by attempting to\r\ngrasp all the varieties that are offered and commended, which is very\r\nwell for some one person in every region to do. It is a labor of love\r\nfor the benefit of his fellow townsmen; but it is far better for him\r\nwho is about to plant an orchard, either large or small, to determine\r\nwhich varieties are best adapted for his purposes. For the small\r\nplanter, who is providing for the wants of his family, a number of\r\nvarieties that will ripen in succession will be best, and the sorts\r\nshould be selected with regard to their qualities for household uses.\r\nThe planter of extensive commercial orchards, on the contrary, will\r\nneed but a limited number of varieties, which should be selected with\r\na view to the wants of the markets he intends to supply, as well as to\r\nthe productiveness of the fruit, and its ability to bear\r\ntransportation. While it is desirable to have but a few well selected\r\nvarieties in such an orchard, it must be recollected that even when\r\nthere is a general failure of the crop, there are always some sorts\r\nthat bear fruit, and this is an argument against making the list too\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to make out lists of fruits for general cultivation over\r\nthe great extent of our country have been abortive. State and regional\r\nlists are made by the Pomological and other societies, which are\r\nuseful in rendering approximate information; but, at last, every\r\nplanter should observe the fruits that succeed in his own\r\nneighborhood, and upon soil similar to his own, and select his\r\nvarieties for planting accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn making up our judgment of the excellence of a fruit, there are many\r\nelements that enter into the question of what constitutes a good\r\napple, and so much depends upon the tastes of the individuals who have\r\nthe question to decide, that at last every one is left to make up his\r\nown mind as to what will be best for his particular case.\r\n\r\nThe American Pomological Society, many years ago, attempted to make\r\nout lists that would be applicable to the whole country, but it was\r\nvery soon discovered that their recommendations were by no means of\r\nuniversal application, and that what was valuable in one section was\r\nworthless in another. The State and local societies took up the work,\r\nand the result of their labors has been of great value to persons\r\nsimilarly situated. In some States, regions, with peculiar soils and\r\ndifferent underlying rocks, were found to be more or less fitted for\r\nthe production of different varieties, and partial or local lists have\r\nbeen made out upon this principle. The greater value of the data thus\r\nobtained commended itself to the National Society, which has since\r\ncollated these lists so far as possible in a tabular form, which shows\r\nthe relative appreciation in which many varieties are held in the\r\nseveral regions that have reported; to these the reader is\r\nreferred.[52] At present I propose to present a few lists which have\r\nbeen given by eminent pomologists, in different parts of the country,\r\nas the result of their extended observations, and applicable in their\r\nseveral districts.\r\n\r\nHenry Little and others recommend for Maine:\r\n\r\n    Baldwin,\r\n    Blue Pearmain,\r\n    Bough,\r\n    Danvers,\r\n    Duchess of Oldenburgh,\r\n    Fameuse,\r\n    Golden Ball,\r\n    Golden Sweet,\r\n    Gravenstein,\r\n    Hubbardston,\r\n    Jewett's Fine Red,\r\n    Minister,\r\n    Mother,\r\n    Northern Spy,\r\n    Porter,\r\n    Red Astrachan,\r\n    Rhode Island Greening,\r\n    Ribstone Pippin,\r\n    Roxbury Russet,\r\n    Sops of Wine,\r\n    Tallman Sweet,\r\n    Vandervere (Newtown Spitzenberg),\r\n    Vermont,\r\n    Williams' Favorite,\r\n    Winthrop.\r\n\r\nThe following list was furnished by C.

The\r\ntestimony of some of our best observers has been collected, and will\r\nbe of value, though it may be observed that there is some discrepancy\r\nas to certain sorts.\r\n\r\nThe following list of hardy and tender varieties was prepared by\r\nReuben Ragan, Putnam County, Indiana, and has since been carefully\r\nrevised.

The Roman numerals indicate the _Class_ and\r\n_Order_ to which it is referred, and the Arabics, the _Section_ and\r\n_Sub-section_, according to the classification adopted in this work.\r\nAfter this comes the season of maturity, Summer, Autumn, Winter,\r\nSpring, and the estimate of quality, from very best, best, very good,\r\ngood; good? meaning almost good; poor? meaning rather so, and last\r\nplainly poor, when considered decidedly inferior. The names of\r\nvarieties described in this volume are given in =full faced= type,\r\nwith reference to the pages, while synonyms are printed in _Italics_.\r\nAbbreviations will explain themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Key:\r\n  small: sm.\r\n  medium: med.\r\n  f.
